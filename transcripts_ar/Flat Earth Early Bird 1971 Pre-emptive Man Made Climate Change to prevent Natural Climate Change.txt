222.519 --> 231.48000000000002
sunny days at all this year here in the

226.68 --> 231.48000000000002
Netherlands L Health Luna Bar good see

234.04 --> 241.2
you you prefer the Arian live weather

238.2 --> 241.2
demonstration

241.799 --> 245.92000000000002
well yeah you could check the weather

243.439 --> 249.84
anywhere but I mean the visuals do

245.92 --> 249.83999999999997
really help you to get a picture I

254.799 --> 260.0
mean sometimes what I see out there and

257.68 --> 262.479
what it reads out doesn't really match

260.0 --> 262.479
all that

262.639 --> 266.88
much all right

276.28 --> 281.55999999999995
so

277.199 --> 281.56
yeah welcome to the early bird

282.72 --> 286.52000000000004
show had a pretty good

288.36 --> 294.28000000000003
rest starting to figure out how to go to

291.199 --> 299.44
bed a little bit earlier than I have in

294.28 --> 299.44
the last week that is helping

312.919 --> 318.479
oh you got 24° Celsius Heth lunar lucky

323.0 --> 329.479
you I wish I had a bit of heat like that

326.199 --> 329.479
over here

342.16 --> 346.84000000000003
all right so yeah yesterday's show in my

345.4 --> 350.479
opinion kind of

346.84 --> 352.84
sucked well I didn't give it a title and

350.479 --> 356.12
it was really

352.84 --> 358.63899999999995
cranky still got like tons of views so I

356.12 --> 362.28000000000003
guess that all these hate Watchers that

358.639 --> 365.16
it basically told to go kill themselves

362.28 --> 368.96
I guess they all tuned in like

365.16 --> 372.12
oh yes oh we need to watch this

368.96 --> 376.15999999999997
one I don't know

372.12 --> 376.16
why I don't know why they do

376.639 --> 383.12
it but uh yeah today I'm really hoping

380.16 --> 383.12
I'm getting a bit

384.24 --> 391.479
better keeping my cool I did actually

388.08 --> 394.71999999999997
call My Healer after this show

391.479 --> 396.039
yesterday to try to help stabilize me

394.72 --> 399.52000000000004
and that did

396.039 --> 403.68
work gave me some good tips though

399.52 --> 407.28
basically like don't let let it get

403.68 --> 408.199
there it's kind of weird basic advice

407.28 --> 411.96
like

408.199 --> 411.96000000000004
that but it's very

416.039 --> 423.759
true like stick to your own things

420.479 --> 423.75899999999996
so that is what I will

425.16 --> 430.08000000000004
do I can only figure out what to talk

436.24 --> 439.319
[Music]

445.919 --> 451.35999999999996
about it's not a ton of super

448.84 --> 454.56
interesting things things are happening

451.36 --> 457.16
anyway Elon Musk rocket blew up or

454.56 --> 461.0
something I had to notice that through

457.16 --> 461.0
Infowars like

461.479 --> 467.8
yeah

463.28 --> 471.11999999999995
weird giant black I mean even Alex made

467.8 --> 476.0
a joke of that it was a giant black

471.12 --> 478.44
dick but it did blow up though like what

476.0 --> 483.4
like now even Alex is making these

478.44 --> 483.4
jokes this is getting kind of weird

511.039 --> 517.88
all right I'm just uh taking a look

513.2 --> 517.88
around see what's been going on out

523.8 --> 533.519
there to get the Reform

528.08 --> 533.519
Party okay Moxy is that Nigel farage's

538.04 --> 543.8
party was this success oh yeah sure it

568.36 --> 572.36
was for

617.24 --> 623.88
all right it seems like

620.079 --> 626.04
uh in Europe the supposed War economy

623.88 --> 631.32
means that all the farmers get kicked

626.04 --> 631.3199999999999
out and instead we're supposed to be

632.839 --> 638.12
building

634.839 --> 641.24
weapons for Ukraine of course oh it's so

638.12 --> 644.9590000000001
important like that seems to be the plan

641.24 --> 648.5600000000001
that that has been rolling out and

644.959 --> 648.56
it's it's just

648.6 --> 654.0400000000001
criminal and we're not taking

651.0 --> 657.04
it anyway hey hello clutch good to see

654.04 --> 657.04
you

672.56 --> 677.6389999999999
oh oh you want to test my patience again

675.48 --> 681.36
Luna Bar you want to bring up freaking

677.639 --> 681.36
wrestling again you know what happened

682.959 --> 687.8
yesterday better not do that

699.639 --> 703.76
[ __ ] is going to kick off yeah some kind

701.88 --> 707.88
of [ __ ] is going to kick off but it's

703.76 --> 711.399
just a giant [ __ ] mess and I mean I'm

707.88 --> 711.399
so sick of this [ __ ]

711.56 --> 717.92
government on what they're doing it's

714.519 --> 721.0
it's absolutely [ __ ] it's not in the

717.92 --> 724.3199999999999
interest of the public at all like not

721.0 --> 727.56
even remotely they're literally

724.32 --> 730.0
parasiting off the people just to try to

727.56 --> 732.76
get to their

730.0 --> 737.399
opponent without any real Prospect of

732.76 --> 737.399
winning it's it is monstrous

742.86 --> 745.989
[Music]

758.68 --> 761.88
all right

763.99 --> 767.049
[Music]

781.76 --> 786.12
all right anyway I got Illuminati C

783.92 --> 786.12
right

787.36 --> 794.1990000000001
here so I'm going to take a bite out of

790.12 --> 794.199
that right away

816.48 --> 819.8000000000001
this evening I'm going to be cooking a

818.8 --> 823.88
proper

819.8 --> 823.88
meal for the next half

824.72 --> 833.9200000000001
week hopefully that will contribute

828.36 --> 833.92
to My overall well-being

843.6 --> 848.519
cuz I've noticed that I've just not been

845.48 --> 848.519
eating super

851.279 --> 855.959
great in the last week

864.96 --> 868.169
[Music]

871.959 --> 876.7199999999999
it's not like I just entirely skipped

873.959 --> 880.5189999999999
dinner it's just that that I did not

876.72 --> 880.519
really eat all that

881.12 --> 885.48
much just feeling kind of stressed

885.8 --> 892.199
[Music]

887.959 --> 892.199
out all right

922.68 --> 925.68
what

933.68 --> 939.0
oh did you hear the latest report about

935.959 --> 942.56
global warming it's the highest rate of

939.0 --> 946.279
global climate change

942.56 --> 946.279
ever total

948.04 --> 953.279
forit but I mean I'm sure that just

950.959 --> 956.68
turning Europe into a war economy is

953.279 --> 959.4399999999999
going to be really really helpful for

956.68 --> 961.6389999999999
global warming I bet that's not going to

959.44 --> 965.639
do damage at

961.639 --> 968.519
all building war vehicles and all that

965.639 --> 970.36
I'm sure it's going to work against

968.519 --> 972.8
climate change if we do that kind of

970.36 --> 976.12
industry right I mean it all makes so

972.8 --> 976.12
much sense

991.44 --> 994.639
yeah get the [ __ ] out of

1015.759 --> 1022.839
here oh

1017.56 --> 1025.72
wow you red Pakistan got really heat hot

1022.839 --> 1029.4
recently who could have

1025.72 --> 1032.24
thought yeah it gets really hot in

1029.4 --> 1035.439
Pakistan

1032.24 --> 1038.039
sometimes India had a heatwave record

1035.439 --> 1041.199
too so I heard

1038.039 --> 1044.559
recently uh yeah well not noticing that

1041.199 --> 1044.559
over here at

1047.84 --> 1051.8799999999999
all for

1072.1 --> 1075.1299999999999
[Music]

1087.02 --> 1093.109
[Applause]

1089.97 --> 1093.109
[Music]

1107.919 --> 1115.3600000000001
okay well I got to temp temporary title

1110.36 --> 1119.24
based on the crap that

1115.36 --> 1119.24
rolling we'll see where that

1121.88 --> 1128.44
leads Central India reachs 56° C that's

1126.159 --> 1135.159
mad yeah

1128.44 --> 1135.159
that's but I mean that does happen there

1140.44 --> 1145.0800000000002
it's like an equatorial country what did

1142.76 --> 1145.08
you

1150.76 --> 1156.52
expect I

1153.0 --> 1160.76
mean it certainly doesn't have any

1156.52 --> 1165.28
logical connection to any gas emissions

1160.76 --> 1167.96
or anything by man like that is

1165.28 --> 1170.72
obviously completely not related to any

1167.96 --> 1170.72
of it

1174.24 --> 1178.44
it's a hyped up instrumental

1180.559 --> 1186.2
error well I

1182.6 --> 1188.799
mean people in India will be able to to

1186.2 --> 1191.679
tell whether it is really that hot or

1188.799 --> 1195.24
not so yeah maybe it's an instrumental

1191.679 --> 1199.679
error maybe they're just like overhyping

1195.24 --> 1204.72
it I mean I wouldn't be surprised is if

1199.679 --> 1207.799
like 56° celsus basically happens every

1204.72 --> 1209.679
year and they're just like oh look oh

1207.799 --> 1212.6399999999999
the graph that we're showing it looks

1209.679 --> 1214.72
like red burning hot like oh my God it's

1212.64 --> 1217.2
so hot it's such a heat

1214.72 --> 1219.52
wave

1217.2 --> 1221.799
uh well if you're going to depict it

1219.52 --> 1221.799
like

1222.12 --> 1226.039
that I mean they did the same kind of

1224.52 --> 1231.24
nonsense

1226.039 --> 1231.24
in was it last year in

1233.24 --> 1237.96
Europe was that even like in March or

1235.84 --> 1242.039
something like when was there this mini

1237.96 --> 1242.039
hitway for just this very short

1242.919 --> 1248.76
bit was that in April or in March I I'm

1246.64 --> 1254.159
not sure exactly when it

1248.76 --> 1254.1589999999999
was but they hyped the [ __ ] out of it

1263.96 --> 1268.88
equator doesn't pass fre what it

1270.559 --> 1278.72
didn't is it the equator is like

1274.0 --> 1278.72
right at the tip of India isn't

1279.48 --> 1286.52
it well anyhow it is pretty much at the

1283.4 --> 1289.8400000000001
Tropic at the Tropic so it's going to be

1286.52 --> 1289.84
hot there

1305.88 --> 1310.6000000000001
got a weird muscle in my back that's

1308.279 --> 1310.6
just

1312.6 --> 1319.039
like like I'm getting poked in my back

1315.64 --> 1319.039
all the time

1321.919 --> 1327.2
but in a way that's actually good not

1325.2 --> 1331.0800000000002
because it's Pleasant that that happens

1327.2 --> 1334.3600000000001
but when that happens every time I mean

1331.08 --> 1335.76
eventually I just figure that out every

1334.36 --> 1339.0
time I get

1335.76 --> 1342.52
that always happens in response to

1339.0 --> 1345.48
periods of extreme

1342.52 --> 1347.8799999999999
agitation then this happens the

1345.48 --> 1349.76
agitation stops because it literally

1347.88 --> 1355.96
gets in the way of the agitation and

1349.76 --> 1355.96
after that usually restore to being very

1357.0 --> 1362.6
focused back pain it's not really back

1359.52 --> 1365.08
pain howl don't worry about it it's just

1362.6 --> 1367.36
a just a muscle that's

1365.08 --> 1371.1589999999999
just

1367.36 --> 1373.9189999999999
like somewhere at my shoulder

1371.159 --> 1376.88
blade it's not like I'm like all twisted

1373.919 --> 1380.88
up or anything don't worry about

1376.88 --> 1385.6000000000001
it so it's not really back

1380.88 --> 1385.6000000000001
pain it's just just a muscle that

1386.84 --> 1392.76
just like I'm getting a knuckle right in

1389.679 --> 1395.1200000000001
my shoulder blade like like that or

1392.76 --> 1398.52

have found me

1653.88 --> 1658.679
again they're trying to insert their

1656.679 --> 1661.679
shitty

1658.679 --> 1661.679
useless

1669.48 --> 1678.48
comments yeah the quality level of the

1673.84 --> 1680.12
input of the trolls really backs

1678.48 --> 1684.799
my

1680.12 --> 1684.799
point of what these people should

1693.77 --> 1696.93
[Music]

1702.32 --> 1708.24
do yeah what you should do with your own

1705.24 --> 1708.24
lives

1708.32 --> 1713.0
cuz you're not really worth it

1714.36 --> 1717.7199999999998
yeah your

1717.76 --> 1721.519
Consciousness it's not worth

1722.919 --> 1729.96
it this is how you willingly spend your

1726.84 --> 1732.1999999999998
time doing that stuff then you shouldn't

1729.96 --> 1733.8400000000001
be here you shouldn't be here in this

1732.2 --> 1736.8400000000001
world you shouldn't be here in this

1733.84 --> 1736.84
timeline

1743.44 --> 1748.48
no the topic isn't Tropics of lunabar

1746.679 --> 1752.44
that's not the topic at all it's just

1748.48 --> 1752.44
something that came up

1793.2 --> 1801.3600000000001
right so yeah the new stupid w

1798.24 --> 1805.159
crap with supposed bird

1801.36 --> 1808.039
flu and the funny thing is is that and

1805.159 --> 1810.88
this is like a big change cuz in the

1808.039 --> 1814.76
past I had to witness how Farmers would

1810.88 --> 1817.6000000000001
have like their entire Farms just all of

1814.76 --> 1821.12
their flock exterminated and all that

1817.6 --> 1824.6789999999999
which is like horrifying to me like

1821.12 --> 1827.12
that's I mean it is quite literally a

1824.679 --> 1831.88
satanic sacrifice every time that

1827.12 --> 1831.8799999999999
happens cuz it's absolute

1833.559 --> 1840.6
[ __ ] yeah killing those animals

1837.279 --> 1844.279
achieves absolutely

1840.6 --> 1844.279
nothing it never

1847.399 --> 1851.7199999999998
does and I think that people are

1849.76 --> 1854.799
starting to catch on to this crap

1851.72 --> 1858.3990000000001
they're just catching onto the medical

1854.799 --> 1861.12
industrial complex scams

1858.399 --> 1863.36
we've all been subjected to it like

1861.12 --> 1865.12
throughout our

1863.36 --> 1867.799
lifetimes

1865.12 --> 1869.559
yeah so congratulations medical

1867.799 --> 1871.84
industrial complex oh you thought you

1869.559 --> 1874.12
could make the ultimate

1871.84 --> 1877.039
move you thought you could make the move

1874.12 --> 1880.6
on Humanity well guess what

1877.039 --> 1885.48
Humanity now figured it out they figured

1880.6 --> 1890.559
out that you are nothing but scam

1885.48 --> 1893.96
artists scam artists that deal in

1890.559 --> 1898.1589999999999
death that just try to convince us to

1893.96 --> 1900.3600000000001
murder cattle and

1898.159 --> 1901.88
flocks and

1900.36 --> 1905.08
people

1901.88 --> 1909.0390000000002
and they're kind of wary of it they're

1905.08 --> 1911.519
wary of you your time has come yeah

1909.039 --> 1914.639
medical industrial complex is going to

1911.519 --> 1914.639
become a thing of the

1915.679 --> 1921.88
past and I think that the entire your

1918.2 --> 1925.3600000000001
practice is going to be uh

1921.88 --> 1925.3600000000001
outlawed at some

1933.24 --> 1936.6
point which it

1946.84 --> 1950.8799999999999
should for

1987.08 --> 1990.36
so that's happening out

2004.639 --> 2012.039
there and it's great I'm very happy like

2009.08 --> 2013.799
I mean Mexico Mexico did this so they

2012.039 --> 2016.039
might have had like

2013.799 --> 2018.679
this jewy

2016.039 --> 2022.279
woman that became president there but

2018.679 --> 2027.3990000000001
Mexico just basically denied the who

2022.279 --> 2030.919
claim like oh fatal bird flu in Mexico

2027.399 --> 2033.9189999999999
and they're like no I

2030.919 --> 2036.3990000000001
mean damn it we need a Jewish woman in

2033.919 --> 2039.0800000000002
power too I mean if that's what Jewish

2036.399 --> 2040.12
women in power actually do and they just

2039.08 --> 2043.72
say

2040.12 --> 2046.399
hey who go [ __ ] yourself you're lying

2043.72 --> 2049.2400000000002
you're wrong I mean damn I want a Jewish

2046.399 --> 2049.24
woman in power

2051.599 --> 2057.32
too I mean these [ __ ] in power

2054.679 --> 2061.919
here all they just want is just to ruin

2057.32 --> 2065.76
our economy and just waste it all on

2061.919 --> 2065.7599999999998
stupid unwinable

2066.72 --> 2070.6789999999996
Wars for

2081.38 --> 2087.639
[Music]

for

2396.319 --> 2400.359
h for

2438.52 --> 2442.04
right so yeah that's it I'm just looking

2440.359 --> 2446.5989999999997
around in the news there's nothing

2442.04 --> 2446.599
really that stands out a

2454.04 --> 2461.44
lot don't forget to Rogan up the show

2457.04 --> 2465.2799999999997

2461.44 --> 2465.28
forums just with each

2467.119 --> 2472.88
other and hey if anybody here that isn't

2470.64 --> 2475.4

2472.88 --> 2475.4
kind of a

2476.359 --> 2480.16
topic I'm open for

2482.52 --> 2487.28
that if you're still there

2514.839 --> 2521.319
otherwise it's going to be a very short

2516.52 --> 2521.319
show yeah if this is your Q all to just

2523.88 --> 2527.599
leave then so will

2528.68 --> 2533.96
I right that's a promise

2561.68 --> 2570.64
all right so the uh [ __ ]

2566.92 --> 2575.28
LD now apparently is going to sell

2570.64 --> 2577.4
edible insect crap so yeah that that's

2575.28 --> 2580.0400000000004
the store I'm never ever going to watch

2577.4 --> 2583.119
into ever again not that I really did

2580.04 --> 2583.119
that in the past

2588.04 --> 2593.0
but so they're trying to get

2593.24 --> 2600.72
us like that right first they just

2598.079 --> 2603.079
suggested have it available got people

2600.72 --> 2606.0
used to it being around and then they

2603.079 --> 2607.2400000000002
take away all the other things and then

2606.0 --> 2608.48
you don't have a choice that's that's

2607.24 --> 2611.5989999999997
how they want to do

2608.48 --> 2614.8
it so even just having it available

2611.599 --> 2614.8
should be

2617.2 --> 2620.7999999999997
boycotted if all

2636.04 --> 2639.04
possible

2666.04 --> 2670.079
for for

2730.24 --> 2734.5589999999997
right well I would like to address for a

2732.559 --> 2736.3190000000004
bit I mean if nothing is going to happen

2734.559 --> 2739.559
here if nobody's going to show up in the

2736.319 --> 2741.24
chat now for 15 minutes it's like oh

2739.559 --> 2743.559
yeah we said something and now we're

2741.24 --> 2744.9199999999996
just stopping to talk we're just stop

2743.559 --> 2746.1600000000003
the talk we're just going to do

2744.92 --> 2750.88
something else

2746.16 --> 2754.5989999999997
now that's cool yes sure it's

2750.88 --> 2757.359
cool but I mean yeah clearly

2754.599 --> 2760.7200000000003
yesterday lost his wrench because he

2757.359 --> 2760.72
roll in some

2761.06 --> 2766.0
[Music]

2763.2 --> 2767.24
atrocity that have been has kind of been

2766.0 --> 2771.64
puzzling

2767.24 --> 2774.68
me that something like that even

2771.64 --> 2777.839
exists this crazy accusation of

2774.68 --> 2782.48
pedophilia towards Jesus

2777.839 --> 2788.359
Christ from some old

2782.48 --> 2790.319
Greek scripture or something and like

2788.359 --> 2793.319
I want to kind of figure out what that

2790.319 --> 2795.079
was about cuz I'm not trusting that

2793.319 --> 2798.96
Source first

2795.079 --> 2802.52
off but I like it was very shocking to

2798.96 --> 2806.28
me and it like completely caught me off

2802.52 --> 2809.96
guard no idea that something like that

2806.28 --> 2814.6800000000003
even was going on out there

2809.96 --> 2814.68
so but uh yeah

2818.599 --> 2824.2000000000003
I kind of wanted to like address it with

2822.079 --> 2826.2000000000003
people that would be looking into it and

2824.2 --> 2830.0789999999997
I think that flat Sage

2826.2 --> 2834.24
actually looked into it that would be

2830.079 --> 2834.2400000000002
very helpful if I was able to discuss

2834.839 --> 2841.359
that what was the legal age back there

2837.8 --> 2846.48
was no legal age back then Lucy

2841.359 --> 2847.64
level there is no legal age yeah that

2846.48 --> 2851.839
doesn't

2847.64 --> 2854.44
exist overreact go [ __ ]

2851.839 --> 2856.72
yourself I did not

2854.44 --> 2861.68
overreact it's an

2856.72 --> 2866.5989999999997
atrocity yeah and to accuse that is like

2861.68 --> 2870.0
sex in that time was exclusively for

2866.599 --> 2873.88
procreation procreation exclusively

2870.0 --> 2873.88
there is no legal

2874.079 --> 2881.0
age no legal age literally doesn't exist

2878.359 --> 2885.72
the only thing that's relevant is

2881.0 --> 2889.2
marriage and yeah you could marry very

2885.72 --> 2895.0
young and I'm all okay with

2889.2 --> 2897.839
that yeah people did not have sex for

2895.0 --> 2901.88
pleasure there was no legal age having

2897.839 --> 2906.5589999999997
sex for pleasure was

2901.88 --> 2906.559
illegal as it should be

2909.119 --> 2912.119
marriage

2920.52 --> 2925.599
yeah so he could not be what he was

2923.68 --> 2928.0789999999997
accused of then I don't know what

2925.599 --> 2931.28
exactly happened I didn't watch that

2928.079 --> 2933.6400000000003
entire video or looked in look deeply

2931.28 --> 2933.6400000000003
into

2934.88 --> 2942.599
it the whole thing was just just an

2937.44 --> 2942.599
atrocity to me like I couldn't deal with

2944.64 --> 2948.96
it Hello Lucy level by the

2951.119 --> 2960.44
way but I would like to really carefully

2957.559 --> 2962.48
look into what that is what the source

2960.44 --> 2964.96
of that it

2962.48 --> 2967.839
is where that's coming

2964.96 --> 2970.64
from I don't trust it

2967.839 --> 2975.839
cuz if that kind of thing was actually

2970.64 --> 2979.8799999999997
real then like that literally blows up

2975.839 --> 2984.96
all of Christianity everything like

2979.88 --> 2987.799
forever it negates everything everything

2984.96 --> 2991.64
no exception everything would be gone

2987.799 --> 2993.559
and only the [ __ ] devil would rule if

2991.64 --> 2994.8799999999997
that actually happened like that like it

2993.559 --> 2999.76
is

2994.88 --> 2999.76
suggested and I can't settle for

3002.359 --> 3008.0
that the Bible is the source well I

3005.04 --> 3008.0
don't know about

3008.079 --> 3014.8390000000004
that I'm not so sure I I highly distrust

3012.319 --> 3014.839
all of

3015.68 --> 3019.72
that an

3017.48 --> 3021.76
interpretation well if it's just an

3019.72 --> 3024.7599999999998
interpretation then it's just [ __ ]

3021.76 --> 3024.76
[ __ ]

3034.359 --> 3039.44
I

3035.319 --> 3043.839
mean who knows what the hell that

3039.44 --> 3043.839
supposed s scenario even

3046.96 --> 3053.96
was like in my mind like maybe it had

3049.92 --> 3058.04
something to do with physiy maybe he was

3053.96 --> 3058.04
like studying something

3058.68 --> 3063.5989999999997
I don't know I don't know what the hell

3061.4 --> 3063.599
that

3064.04 --> 3072.839
is but to just immediately just say oh

3068.64 --> 3076.16
pedophile I mean that is just that's

3072.839 --> 3076.16
just blasphemy

3091.2 --> 3097.5989999999997
I would say it's something come up by

3094.24 --> 3099.16
atheist or you you mean they made it up

3097.599 --> 3102.88
yeah that's what I think too I think

3099.16 --> 3102.8799999999997
that they made it up

3128.599 --> 3133.599
sexual pleasure should be illegal yeah

3148.359 --> 3153.44
but it's not going to be here and so

3151.04 --> 3157.16
everything's just going to increasingly

3153.44 --> 3157.16
get worse as it is

3158.24 --> 3165.0789999999997
right but uh back then it was illegal

3162.76 --> 3167.8390000000004
that is the law that was the law it's

3165.079 --> 3171.6800000000003
been the law for a very long

3167.839 --> 3176.04
time yeah there's no age of consent

3171.68 --> 3176.04
there is an age of marriage

3187.44 --> 3190.4
that's right

3195.28 --> 3200.799
clutch the Bible according to Christian

3197.839 --> 3200.799
I don't give a [ __ ]

3204.4 --> 3208.6800000000003
Larry I don't know what the hell they

3206.76 --> 3211.28
believe they believe stupid riddles

3208.68 --> 3213.96
about it too where did my oh where the

3211.28 --> 3216.28
[ __ ] you think it went

3213.96 --> 3220.319
Clary you're lucky I didn't just

3216.28 --> 3220.3190000000004

3312.599 --> 3318.319
you're an anti-christian that's what you

3315.24 --> 3320.839
are that's what you are pushing that's

3318.319 --> 3322.5589999999997
what you are insisting upon that's what

3320.839 --> 3325.319
is the case you're

3322.559 --> 3327.3590000000004
making you're an

4001.2 --> 4005.72
happen you are going to be exterminated

4004.359 --> 4009.72
for this

4005.72 --> 4011.9599999999996
crap you better learn some damn Purity

4009.72 --> 4011.9599999999996
and

4013.359 --> 4019.96
quick if you don't stop

4016.92 --> 4023.16
obsessing with demonic behavior and

4019.96 --> 4026.119
seeing it in everything you're going to

4023.16 --> 4026.1189999999997
get yourself

4041.359 --> 4046.24
guilt said stuff today and early this

4044.319 --> 4048.0389999999998
week but what more

4046.24 --> 4051.319
said nothing bad

4048.039 --> 4054.2400000000002
careful what what what are you saying

4051.319 --> 4057.119
like what message was removed

4054.24 --> 4060.5989999999997
clutch could you

4057.119 --> 4064.0
please type it in in

4060.599 --> 4066.0
exactly the message that didn't show up

4064.0 --> 4069.0
in Skype could you please type it in

4066.0 --> 4071.079
Skype I've asked others before that said

4069.0 --> 4073.92
like hey the message didn't show up well

4071.079 --> 4077.1600000000003
could you then say it in

4073.92 --> 4080.039
Skype then I know exactly what you

4077.16 --> 4083.0
weren't capable of saying in YouTube so

4080.039 --> 4083.0
please type it in

4092.96 --> 4095.96
Skype

4104.44 --> 4107.44
thanks

4134.44 --> 4138.4
e for

4174.319 --> 4180.52
H really okay so clutch said a lot of

4178.4 --> 4183.239
people are waking up maybe this is

4180.52 --> 4187.4800000000005
another reason they want World War II to

4183.239 --> 4191.959999999999
get rid of them I don't know why YouTube

4187.48 --> 4194.759999999999
would remove that that's very

4191.96 --> 4197.32
strange it's not even like remotely

4194.76 --> 4197.320000000001
threatening

4198.44 --> 4205.5199999999995
and by the way this is not correct yeah

4201.239 --> 4209.12
people waking up is not the like the

4205.52 --> 4213.6
whole point about World War II and

4209.12 --> 4216.0
people waking up is you can't get rid of

4213.6 --> 4219.56
people waking

4216.0 --> 4222.36
up like they can't actually do that

4219.56 --> 4224.88
that's the entire Point that's the

4222.36 --> 4227.0
threat if they could just get rid of him

4224.88 --> 4230.56
then they wouldn't give a [ __ ] if people

4227.0 --> 4232.56
were go they can't that's the problem

4230.56 --> 4234.159000000001
you can't even get rid of them with

4232.56 --> 4237.6
World War

4234.159 --> 4242.239
I yeah you can only

4237.6 --> 4244.04
besiege people that wake up and get them

4242.239 --> 4246.04
to the point where they starve to death

4244.04 --> 4249.679
or kill themselves because of

4246.04 --> 4251.6
demoralization that's the only way you

4249.679 --> 4252.92
can get rid of people that are actually

4251.6 --> 4256.4800000000005
waking

4252.92 --> 4259.92
up now World War I is to get rid of the

4256.48 --> 4263.4
people that don't wake

4259.92 --> 4263.4
up that's the

4266.12 --> 4271.5199999999995
point right but if people are going to

4268.719 --> 4277.04
just overtly turn

4271.52 --> 4279.52
demonic and just become obsessed with

4277.04 --> 4282.159
pedophilia like one way or another like

4279.52 --> 4284.8
if you get hate obsessed with pedophilia

4282.159 --> 4286.839999999999
you effectively become a pedophile

4284.8 --> 4289.1990000000005
because that's all that's on your mind

4286.84 --> 4292.8
now like it doesn't matter whether you

4289.199 --> 4294.799999999999
have a a rage boner against it or

4292.8 --> 4298.320000000001
whether you have like a gleeful

4294.8 --> 4301.4800000000005
obsession with it both it results in the

4298.32 --> 4304.48
same [ __ ] it's both the same [ __ ]

4301.48 --> 4304.48
demon

4327.28 --> 4333.36
they certainly are gr yeah but they

4328.92 --> 4336.36
can't they can't they can't get rid of

4333.36 --> 4339.5199999999995
the woken of people clutch heed my words

4336.36 --> 4343.04
everything I just described is

4339.52 --> 4347.84
real that's the whole point if they wake

4343.04 --> 4352.36
up then they if people wake up then the

4347.84 --> 4355.1990000000005
government the mind control system loses

4352.36 --> 4355.199
power over

4358.92 --> 4365.84
them they

4361.36 --> 4368.839999999999
can't kill them if somebody wakes up

4365.84 --> 4371.88
then government can't kill them that's

4368.84 --> 4375.1990000000005
like the entire core

4371.88 --> 4378.04
mechanism that's the entire point of it

4375.199 --> 4381.919999999999
cuz the government can only get people

4378.04 --> 4385.199
killed by tricking them into getting

4381.92 --> 4388.1990000000005
themselves killed it's with everything

4385.199 --> 4391.599999999999
with every damn thing out

4388.199 --> 4394.44
there that's how they operate they can't

4391.6 --> 4394.4400000000005
just assault

4395.8 --> 4401.2390000000005
them right assaulting them that only

4398.96 --> 4404.679
comes into play when the people person

4401.239 --> 4407.12
that's waking up is like trying to take

4404.679 --> 4407.12
over

4410.96 --> 4416.2390000000005
when they are competing for

4413.36 --> 4417.239
power that's when they can actually go

4416.239 --> 4420.0
after

4417.239 --> 4423.718999999999
them if a person just wakes up and

4420.0 --> 4426.96
they're not competing for

4423.719 --> 4429.639
power then there's literally nothing

4426.96 --> 4433.719
government can do about it nothing

4429.639 --> 4436.96
absolutely nothing they won't make a

4433.719 --> 4439.36
move and they won't have a plan because

4436.96 --> 4443.2390000000005
all the plans on how to get people

4439.36 --> 4447.719
killed are all based on them falling for

4443.239 --> 4450.5599999999995
it and then agreeing to whatever it is

4447.719 --> 4453.679
that is going to get them killed that is

4450.56 --> 4455.96
how government works it's exclusively

4453.679 --> 4455.96
like

4456.159 --> 4460.599999999999
that that's right Richard G could see

4458.56 --> 4465.4800000000005
you they have to make people do it to

4460.6 --> 4465.4800000000005
themselves like they don't have a choice

4468.32 --> 4473.04
right the idea of oh I figured out a

4470.96 --> 4474.36
secret they're going to come for me no

4473.04 --> 4477.84
no they

4474.36 --> 4480.88
won't they're only going to come for you

4477.84 --> 4482.4400000000005
if you're going to undermine their power

4480.88 --> 4486.719
if you're going to

4482.44 --> 4486.719
compete with them

4499.92 --> 4504.32
censored again what okay

4505.239 --> 4511.48
weird but yeah don't fall for the

4508.6 --> 4513.76
trick clutch the idea if they're going

4511.48 --> 4515.879999999999
to come for me because I figured out

4513.76 --> 4520.12
their trick it's not

4515.88 --> 4523.4400000000005
true they lost power over you but they

4520.12 --> 4526.0
can still get you through demoralization

4523.44 --> 4527.159
and letting you get all paranoid and

4526.0 --> 4529.4
they're going to get me they're going to

4527.159 --> 4531.28
get me yeah they're not going to get you

4529.4 --> 4534.159
that's the whole point of waking up is

4531.28 --> 4537.12
that now they're not going to get you

4534.159 --> 4538.679
anymore but people still get paranoid

4537.12 --> 4541.84
and think oh they're going to send my

4538.679 --> 4546.0
swap team after me like no they

4541.84 --> 4546.0
don't they don't

4579.84 --> 4586.639
right but what they will try is to just

4583.36 --> 4590.5199999999995
make everything Harder by dragging

4586.639 --> 4593.32
people into this supposed War economy

4590.52 --> 4595.639
crap it's going to make things tougher

4593.32 --> 4597.44
and then people that know it's all

4595.639 --> 4600.28
[ __ ] yeah they're going to be under

4597.44 --> 4604.678999999999
a lot of moral

4600.28 --> 4606.96
stress yeah but for people that wake up

4604.679 --> 4610.28
the tactic for government to get rid of

4606.96 --> 4612.6
them is to demoralize them to the point

4610.28 --> 4615.159
where they [ __ ] kill

4612.6 --> 4617.2390000000005
themselves that is the real that's the

4615.159 --> 4622.08
only

4617.239 --> 4624.959999999999
recourse that that they have

4622.08 --> 4627.88
left cuz the whole point is is that

4624.96 --> 4632.679
those people don't fall for those tricks

4627.88 --> 4636.12
anymore so full skill demoralization and

4632.679 --> 4641.36
delusion driving them into suicide is

4636.12 --> 4641.36
then the only thing they have left

4663.52 --> 4669.4800000000005
right same with people that get V damag

4666.199 --> 4672.32
and all that [ __ ] or somebody on Alex

4669.48 --> 4675.718999999999
Jones Show yesterday like that terrible

4672.32 --> 4678.5199999999995
story completely paralyzed

4675.719 --> 4681.32
and it's like yeah help me help me and

4678.52 --> 4686.0
like okay government government says

4681.32 --> 4689.88
like oh okay yeah well will'll give you

4686.0 --> 4692.04
uh like free youth in Asia

4689.88 --> 4694.56
options cuz that's what a government

4692.04 --> 4699.32
does that's what they

4694.56 --> 4702.0
do yeah they can't make you do it but

4699.32 --> 4704.5199999999995
they can just make your life yeah they

4702.0 --> 4706.8
can let you fall for tricks to the point

4704.52 --> 4709.56
that absolutely your life is destroyed

4706.8 --> 4712.56
and then they'll offer for you to make

4709.56 --> 4712.56
it easy to kill

4714.36 --> 4720.759999999999
yourself cuz that's what they can do

4717.08 --> 4724.679
they can't kill you they can't make it

4720.76 --> 4727.639
happen they can only offer to do

4724.679 --> 4730.04
that you have to do it you have to be

4727.639 --> 4733.52
fooled you have to ruin your own life to

4730.04 --> 4736.719
the point where you think the end is the

4733.52 --> 4736.719
only option

4749.28 --> 4754.28
could you please stop talking about that

4751.44 --> 4757.638999999999
crap Health Luna Bar it's really [ __ ]

4754.28 --> 4757.639
gross stop

4759.12 --> 4763.719
it and duper could you just not talk

4762.28 --> 4767.679
about that

4763.719 --> 4767.679
crap for

4801.0 --> 4803.56
heyum

4804.0 --> 4811.12
virus no Akuma virus yesterday's show

4807.4 --> 4812.839999999999
sucked it's all [ __ ] troll votes all

4811.12 --> 4816.88
of

4812.84 --> 4822.08
it trolls loved yesterday's show oh they

4816.88 --> 4822.08
loved it so much cuz they're sick

4831.4 --> 4837.08
what did aumu do yesterday nothing get

4833.719 --> 4837.08
timed out

4855.08 --> 4861.8
yeah well stop it hey Health lunabar

4858.6 --> 4865.159000000001
what did I just tell you I just told you

4861.8 --> 4867.679
not to talk about that crap it's [ __ ]

4865.159 --> 4870.199
gross I don't want to hear that [ __ ]

4867.679 --> 4870.1990000000005
from you

4876.159 --> 4883.239
again stop bringing it

4878.88 --> 4883.2390000000005
up it's disgusting

4905.36 --> 4910.04
yeah that's right akumu is anti- kinetic

4907.719 --> 4910.04
that's

4911.08 --> 4918.92
right anti kinetic vectors A KV that's

4915.639 --> 4918.92
always a Kumo virus

4943.52 --> 4946.52
apparently

4973.44 --> 4977.48
for for

4981.71 --> 4984.81
[Music]

5023.6 --> 5029.400000000001
H maybe I got a

5026.0 --> 5031.6
better better title preemptive man-made

5029.4 --> 5032.5599999999995
climate change to prevent natural

5031.6 --> 5035.120000000001
climate

5032.56 --> 5037.96
change yeah I think that's even more

5035.12 --> 5041.88
fitting I mean the war economy that that

5037.96 --> 5041.88
is a thing it's [ __ ]

5045.639 --> 5054.4800000000005
up but this emphasizes the egregious

5050.159 --> 5054.48
nature of it all even more

5070.12 --> 5074.639
do I think climate change is real yeah

5072.639 --> 5076.92
the climate change is duper didn't you

5074.639 --> 5076.92
know

5078.119 --> 5081.96
that happens all the

5085.6 --> 5092.119000000001
time yeah

5087.84 --> 5096.32
and man what man does is very little

5092.119 --> 5096.32
impact except for locally

5097.4 --> 5101.159
yeah

5099.0 --> 5103.56
local toxic

5101.159 --> 5107.08
influences like that actually does

5103.56 --> 5107.080000000001
damage to Nature that's

5110.6 --> 5117.52
measurable but whether man does anything

5114.32 --> 5121.119
or not the climate does

5117.52 --> 5124.92
change like all the

5121.119 --> 5126.5199999999995
time there's swings

5124.92 --> 5128.92
that happen in

5126.52 --> 5133.1990000000005
nature in the

5128.92 --> 5133.1990000000005
climate warm periods cold

5134.159 --> 5142.159
periods stormy periods dry periods like

5138.76 --> 5145.6
yeah the climate changes all the time we

5142.159 --> 5148.4
have absolutely no control over how it's

5145.6 --> 5149.08
going to change whatsoever with anything

5148.4 --> 5153.0
we

5149.08 --> 5155.8
do whether we do nothing it won't change

5153.0 --> 5158.88
anything or whether we do a lot it won't

5155.8 --> 5161.0
change anything it will mostly change

5158.88 --> 5165.32
things

5161.0 --> 5168.36
locally right you have like a high CO2

5165.32 --> 5169.84
production lots of coal power plants

5168.36 --> 5172.119
that are clean and you have them

5169.84 --> 5176.1990000000005
everywhere well yeah that's going to be

5172.119 --> 5178.96
measurable locally because of the extra

5176.199 --> 5182.239
CO2 it's going to be greener

5178.96 --> 5186.2390000000005
there it might be a little

5182.239 --> 5186.239
warmer like locally

5186.56 --> 5192.400000000001
just a

5188.119 --> 5194.759999999999
little little warmer little Greener but

5192.4 --> 5196.799999999999
on the overall world it's going to make

5194.76 --> 5199.639
absolutely no

5196.8 --> 5203.320000000001
difference cuz you could like have all

5199.639 --> 5206.92
the all the coal power plants in China

5203.32 --> 5209.48
running for a year and it's like oh wow

5206.92 --> 5211.2390000000005
all that CO2 and and other stuff because

5209.48 --> 5215.759999999999
they don't scrub it as cleanly they

5211.239 --> 5219.759999999999
should they should just be very have it

5215.76 --> 5221.6
clean but then like a volcano anywhere

5219.76 --> 5224.92
in the on Earth just

5221.6 --> 5228.04
erupts for like a week or something and

5224.92 --> 5231.159
like that one freaking volcano eruption

5228.04 --> 5235.119
just produces as much CO2 as the

5231.159 --> 5235.119
entirety of China does in a

5235.52 --> 5242.84
year it just Rams out that much

5239.239 --> 5244.919999999999
CO2 like in one

5242.84 --> 5247.8
week so

5244.92 --> 5251.2390000000005
it's absolutely

5247.8 --> 5253.96
pointless absolutely pointless to even

5251.239 --> 5257.759999999999
think that What man

5253.96 --> 5261.6
does even on the long run like has any

5257.76 --> 5265.400000000001
influence on the global climate it

5261.6 --> 5269.719
doesn't it's ridiculous to suggest

5265.4 --> 5271.5199999999995
that yeah but you do have Regional

5269.719 --> 5276.119
influence like

5271.52 --> 5276.119000000001
locally directly in your surround

5290.52 --> 5295.52
ings climate change is trapped ENT that

5293.719 --> 5297.84
makes no logical sense that's a

5295.52 --> 5300.56
nonsensical statement Kumo virus but

5297.84 --> 5300.56
that's that's

5301.719 --> 5308.84
fine what's HTML

5305.92 --> 5311.76
what the [ __ ] he lunabar you don't even

5308.84 --> 5313.92
know what HTML is I even I know what

5311.76 --> 5313.92
that

5315.6 --> 5326.119000000001
is HTML is the language of the

5321.159 --> 5329.638999999999
web that's the computer language of the

5326.119 --> 5333.44
Internet it's what websites are

5329.639 --> 5333.4400000000005
programmed with

5357.159 --> 5361.638999999999
we should not dump toxic waste though

5359.4 --> 5364.4
yeah exactly but clutch I mean it's

5361.639 --> 5367.159000000001
provably a negative influence on the

5364.4 --> 5368.719
environment when you D dump actual toxic

5367.159 --> 5372.199
garbage and

5368.719 --> 5374.56
waste like you can directly measure its

5372.199 --> 5376.638999999999
negative influence and you can notice

5374.56 --> 5378.92
that when that's done that negative

5376.639 --> 5380.52
influence

5378.92 --> 5385.119
stays

5380.52 --> 5389.119000000001
right when you just emit CO2 or methane

5385.119 --> 5392.48
or whatever in not super excessive

5389.119 --> 5395.92
quantities at the same time

5392.48 --> 5399.199
like it doesn't have any lasting

5395.92 --> 5402.4
negative impact and it doesn't change

5399.199 --> 5402.4
average temperature

5406.159 --> 5413.159
either I mean if you want to have

5409.48 --> 5415.32
emissions like directly lead to

5413.159 --> 5418.48
environmental basically climate change

5415.32 --> 5422.719
based change dude you'd have to have

5418.48 --> 5424.678999999999
like 10 really big volcanoes like big

5422.719 --> 5428.76
ones

5424.679 --> 5431.8
and then keep going for like 3 years

5428.76 --> 5434.679
like let's just say 10 huge volcanoes

5431.8 --> 5438.76
around the world erupt and they just

5434.679 --> 5441.719
won't stop for 10 years yeah now after

5438.76 --> 5443.6
those 10 years there is going to be an

5441.719 --> 5447.119
actual climate change yeah it's not

5443.6 --> 5451.719
man-made though because man

5447.119 --> 5455.119
couldn't even when they tried could not

5451.719 --> 5458.2390000000005
produce enough gas

5455.119 --> 5460.799999999999
to achieve anything like that but if

5458.239 --> 5464.0
yeah if 10 really big volcanoes erupted

5460.8 --> 5468.08
and went and spewed and did their thing

5464.0 --> 5470.36
didn't come calm down for like 3

5468.08 --> 5474.679
years yeah

5470.36 --> 5478.239
then then the climate would probably

5474.679 --> 5482.4
shift man can't achieve

5478.239 --> 5485.919999999999
that like we we are not capable of doing

5482.4 --> 5485.92
that even if we

5508.08 --> 5515.4
tried learned HTM X well that's just the

5512.719 --> 5518.6
followup of HT ml it started all with

5515.4 --> 5518.599999999999
HTML that's like the

5518.84 --> 5523.2390000000005
9s and I don't know what the hell they

5521.28 --> 5525.44
call it these days but I mean it's

5523.239 --> 5528.879999999999
basically still

5525.44 --> 5532.159
that language that programming language

5528.88 --> 5532.159000000001
heal lunabar

5548.199 --> 5554.96
carbon catches yeah Rich G there's the

5552.159 --> 5556.839999999999
weird thing like carbon catchers is

5554.96 --> 5560.56
pretty

5556.84 --> 5565.04
weird and overall pointless I mean maybe

5560.56 --> 5565.04
if you had carbon catches around

5565.159 --> 5572.679
like the Amazon which seem to be like oh

5569.159 --> 5575.599999999999
oh so sensitive to CO2 like okay well

5572.679 --> 5578.2390000000005
put carbon catch there then just

5575.6 --> 5581.320000000001
surround the Amazon forest with carbon

5578.239 --> 5584.48
catches apparently the Amazon forest is

5581.32 --> 5588.4
really not well suited to deal with

5584.48 --> 5592.919999999999
carbon emissions just because of local

5588.4 --> 5595.32
just how it works yeah scrub it out and

5592.92 --> 5598.6
then well then you have a bunch of CO2

5595.32 --> 5600.639
tanks and well that's an industrial

5598.6 --> 5603.639
product you could actually use that I

5600.639 --> 5603.639
mean

5603.92 --> 5610.92
I'm not against CO2 collectors it's just

5607.84 --> 5613.639
it's not urgent it's not like oh we have

5610.92 --> 5617.04
to do this now or everything will be

5613.639 --> 5618.639
destroyed that's horseshit but I mean

5617.04 --> 5622.239
just scrubbing

5618.639 --> 5624.2390000000005
it collecting CO2 is like yeah well then

5622.239 --> 5626.959999999999
you have tanks filled with CO2 that's

5624.239 --> 5631.839999999999
actually useful you could use

5626.96 --> 5635.44
that like sell the CO2 to

5631.84 --> 5639.679
Growers and Farmers it's like hi

5635.44 --> 5643.36
we here we have CO2 use

5639.679 --> 5646.0
it yeah use it in your greenhouse gas in

5643.36 --> 5650.96
your green houses they call it a

5646.0 --> 5650.96
greenhouse gas for a good reason use

5655.84 --> 5664.719
it right

5658.76 --> 5664.719
for produce growth stimulation

5665.44 --> 5671.119
bigger Greener

5667.84 --> 5673.679
crops so yeah collect that CO2

5671.119 --> 5675.679
especially from regions where the plant

5673.679 --> 5678.96
life is apparently really vulnerable to

5675.679 --> 5683.0
it I'm all for that if that actually is

5678.96 --> 5685.44
real and not just all nonsense scam a

5683.0 --> 5685.44
bunch of

5686.48 --> 5693.959999999999
talk collect it store it you got tanks

5690.28 --> 5697.0
filled with CO2 and just like yeah sell

5693.96 --> 5699.56
them redistribute them give them to

5697.0 --> 5702.28
Growers and it's like yeah here here you

5699.56 --> 5704.84
go we collected this CO2 from the

5702.28 --> 5707.4
environment now you can use

5704.84 --> 5709.400000000001
that for growing

5707.4 --> 5712.48
plants it will

5709.4 --> 5715.48
help like yeah that sounds like a great

5712.48 --> 5715.48
idea

5725.28 --> 5730.44
Glo claim it I thought it wasn't a Glo

5727.48 --> 5730.44
well that's what they call

5730.88 --> 5734.119
it who

5745.199 --> 5749.199
cares just using their

5749.76 --> 5755.04
lingo I

5751.4 --> 5759.04
mean what how would you prefer I call it

5755.04 --> 5763.0
like a realm wide

5759.04 --> 5765.28
climate it just whatever they call it

5763.0 --> 5768.159
Global Climate I don't care it's based

5765.28 --> 5772.84
on a false

5768.159 --> 5772.839999999999
cosmogeny it's easier to say it that

5776.159 --> 5781.4
way how much carbon they were even

5778.52 --> 5784.080000000001
catching I have no idea Rich

5781.4 --> 5787.199
G but I've heard it before that these

5784.08 --> 5789.48
carbon collectors are there but then

5787.199 --> 5795.48
what do they do with it they just store

5789.48 --> 5795.48
it in tanks and bury it absolutely

5798.199 --> 5805.0
insane like you

5800.639 --> 5808.719
shouldn't store CO2 you should use

5805.0 --> 5812.239
it have it be

5808.719 --> 5815.4800000000005
reabsorbed use it to grow

5812.239 --> 5819.759999999999
plants I mean it's a supposed greenhouse

5815.48 --> 5823.48
gas well then use it in green

5819.76 --> 5826.08
houses Dole it out you're collecting it

5823.48 --> 5829.32
because it's supposedly bad for the

5826.08 --> 5831.92
environment okay well now we have that

5829.32 --> 5836.28
stor well give it to people that have

5831.92 --> 5836.28
green houses that grow plants that grow

5839.88 --> 5845.52
crops we need to give government energy

5843.36 --> 5845.5199999999995
no

5846.96 --> 5850.6
no absolutely

5853.0 --> 5857.159
not they're not going to save the planet

5855.92 --> 5860.159
at

5857.159 --> 5863.199
all green houses don't need greenhouse

5860.159 --> 5864.199
gases yeah but they can use it it will

5863.199 --> 5868.759999999999
actually

5864.199 --> 5868.759999999999
help Akuma virus

5891.96 --> 5897.56
right I mean it's it's all so simple

5895.119 --> 5898.839999999999
like o methane it's so bad okay well

5897.56 --> 5901.280000000001
collect it

5898.84 --> 5902.679
then then you have methane and like oh

5901.28 --> 5904.08
guess what you can do with the methane

5902.679 --> 5906.84
yeah you can burn it

5904.08 --> 5908.719
oh now you have like a a fuel resource

5906.84 --> 5912.119000000001
oh but then it creates CO2 well then you

5908.719 --> 5913.04
collect the CO2 and then you use the CO2

5912.119 --> 5916.679
for

5913.04 --> 5919.76
farming it's like yeah oh these gases oh

5916.679 --> 5923.76
well collect them then and use

5919.76 --> 5926.04
them I mean that doesn't sound

5923.76 --> 5928.08
unreasonable right you think oh these

5926.04 --> 5931.239
gases have a negative influence on the

5928.08 --> 5935.32
environment well locally maybe I mean

5931.239 --> 5940.718999999999
you don't want some mind to just spew

5935.32 --> 5942.88
out tons of CO2 because that's too much

5940.719 --> 5946.639
even for plant life it's if it's too

5942.88 --> 5949.4800000000005
much CO2 too concentrated and like

5946.639 --> 5954.639
animal life can't survive that it'll

5949.48 --> 5958.0
choke so it's like yeah well stop pure

5954.639 --> 5960.599
CO2 when it's too much collect

5958.0 --> 5964.159
it it'll spare the environment now you

5960.599 --> 5967.1990000000005
got concentrated CO2 and could

5964.159 --> 5970.36
redistribute that and then have that be

5967.199 --> 5970.36
used in Crop

5970.92 --> 5975.159
Production yeah these are all

5977.159 --> 5984.598999999999
resources yeah methane gas is a resource

5980.639 --> 5984.599
CO2 gas is a

5988.199 --> 5993.96
resource and then nitrogen it's like

5991.32 --> 5996.119
yeah I mean that's like the predominant

5993.96 --> 5998.52
fact that's the predominant gas in the

5996.119 --> 5998.5199999999995
air I

6003.599 --> 6008.639
mean like you're not going to collect

6006.28 --> 6012.84
that you're not going to suck that out

6008.639 --> 6015.04
of the uh out of the air that's

6012.84 --> 6018.56
ridiculous you wouldn't be able to

6015.04 --> 6018.56
everything would depressurize

6033.8 --> 6040.8
invisible CL ridiculous he

6037.76 --> 6042.599
lunabar whatever China thinks the

6040.8 --> 6044.4400000000005
whatever the hell it thinks it's doing

6042.599 --> 6047.52
it's

6044.44 --> 6052.96
insane like China should like reform

6047.52 --> 6052.96
itself to become really in effective

6053.44 --> 6057.08
Advanced

6054.8 --> 6059.679
environmentalists like that would

6057.08 --> 6062.679
absolutely

6059.679 --> 6067.04
revolutionize everything if they just

6062.679 --> 6067.04
did that it's like do

6077.0 --> 6084.48
it like I'm at that point where like if

6080.0 --> 6087.0
China actually actually

6084.48 --> 6089.598999999999
under goes an environmental Revolution

6087.0 --> 6093.08
that's real and not just stupid climate

6089.599 --> 6095.599
change nonsense propaganda that's

6093.08 --> 6098.599
antihuman but actually becomes

6095.599 --> 6103.96
environmentally friendly actually does

6098.599 --> 6107.639
that dude like they win if they do that

6103.96 --> 6111.76
they win like really really

6107.639 --> 6114.88
win they win like if they do

6111.76 --> 6117.320000000001
that the world would even forgive that

6114.88 --> 6119.84
they're actually kind of a a brutal

6117.32 --> 6119.84
Communist

6119.92 --> 6125.56
Regime there's nothing the world could

6122.679 --> 6128.56
do after that point it's like yeah

6125.56 --> 6131.119000000001
they're no longer polluting

6128.56 --> 6133.52
everything they got massive industry and

6131.119 --> 6137.44
it's all advanced it's all

6133.52 --> 6139.96
clean and like yeah there's just nothing

6137.44 --> 6143.5599999999995
you could say anymore

6139.96 --> 6145.96
then no more worries it's like yeah okay

6143.56 --> 6149.2390000000005
they treat the public in a certain way

6145.96 --> 6152.84
that's not great but I mean just look at

6149.239 --> 6155.638999999999
the rest of the world right now I mean

6152.84 --> 6155.639
how is that any

6164.4 --> 6171.719
different so yeah that's my advice to to

6167.56 --> 6174.159000000001
the CCP is just become actually

6171.719 --> 6176.28
environmentally friendly for real not

6174.159 --> 6178.679
the [ __ ]

6176.28 --> 6181.679
Eugenics social

6178.679 --> 6183.8
control environmentally friendly but

6181.679 --> 6186.1990000000005
really actually

6183.8 --> 6189.88
start understanding and respecting

6186.199 --> 6194.879999999999
nature and helping it Thrive

6189.88 --> 6194.88
locally update your industry make it

6196.32 --> 6203.4
cleaner and it's like and you win you

6199.719 --> 6205.719
win when you do that

6203.4 --> 6205.719
big

6206.8 --> 6213.119000000001
time you'll be the Envy of the world if

6210.599 --> 6216.92
you do that China you already have like

6213.119 --> 6219.08
the biggest industry in in world history

6216.92 --> 6223.8
at this

6219.08 --> 6227.44
point undergo a a good holistic

6223.8 --> 6230.159000000001
environmental Revolution not anti-human

6227.44 --> 6234.839999999999
actually pro- environmental and you'll

6230.159 --> 6236.5599999999995
be the Envy of the world

6234.84 --> 6239.4400000000005
do

6236.56 --> 6242.320000000001
it I don't understand that you haven't

6239.44 --> 6245.5199999999995
even done that yet I mean they have

6242.32 --> 6247.36
cleaned up some cities and [ __ ] like

6245.52 --> 6249.719
made really good interesting

6247.36 --> 6252.5199999999995
developments on how to like

6249.719 --> 6254.4
extract smog from the air which is

6252.52 --> 6255.1990000000005
really effective how they've managed to

6254.4 --> 6257.759999999999
do

6255.199 --> 6260.04
that just have like air filters in the

6257.76 --> 6262.679
middle of the city that just get all the

6260.04 --> 6263.92
crap out and then basically [ __ ] out a

6262.679 --> 6266.76
bunch of

6263.92 --> 6270.84
bricks that it filtered out brilliant

6266.76 --> 6274.04
system brilliant it's a great

6270.84 --> 6276.679
start very pragmatic but I mean you

6274.04 --> 6276.679
could take it

6286.56 --> 6293.4400000000005
farther reflect heat back to what

6296.599 --> 6299.400000000001
I don't know what the hell you're

6297.599 --> 6301.679
talking about akumu virus I mean the

6299.4 --> 6304.92
whole greenhouse gases because it

6301.679 --> 6310.2390000000005
reflects back that's all nonsense

6304.92 --> 6310.2390000000005
spherical climate change horeshit

6310.56 --> 6316.679
science it's

6312.84 --> 6319.719
irrelevant yeah CO2 doesn't do that at

6316.679 --> 6323.679
all it's not the reason why things heat

6319.719 --> 6323.679
up it's all nonsense

6324.76 --> 6329.360000000001
yeah they call CO2 a greenhouse gas

6328.0 --> 6332.32
because of

6329.36 --> 6334.92
supposed yeah Globe Earth climate change

6332.32 --> 6334.92
nonsense

6335.119 --> 6342.5599999999995
science but I mean you should call it a

6339.159 --> 6345.96
greenhouse gas because if you just have

6342.56 --> 6350.119000000001
a greenhouse and you

6345.96 --> 6351.08
release some CO2 in that Greenhouse in

6350.119 --> 6353.92
little

6351.08 --> 6355.719
amounts that you don't just open it all

6353.92 --> 6359.08
up I mean because everything's going to

6355.719 --> 6362.44
choke but is a little amount and it will

6359.08 --> 6365.599
literally like measurably stimulate the

6362.44 --> 6368.0
plant growth like pretty much all

6365.599 --> 6371.0
crops that's the reason why it should be

6368.0 --> 6375.719
called a greenhouse gas because people

6371.0 --> 6377.119
that have green houses should use it in

6375.719 --> 6379.4
those green

6377.119 --> 6381.92
houses that's why it should be called a

6379.4 --> 6385.679
greenhouse gas not because of some

6381.92 --> 6388.719
stupid climate change nonsense sphere

6385.679 --> 6388.719
earth science

6403.4 --> 6408.759999999999
model saving the world recycling their

6406.44 --> 6412.719
milk bottles are the funniest yeah but

6408.76 --> 6412.719
it's still good though

6413.04 --> 6418.599
recycling is good it doesn't matter

6415.32 --> 6421.759999999999
whether it's not as practical as people

6418.599 --> 6421.76
hope because it's the

6422.56 --> 6427.84
intention the intention of recycling is

6431.199 --> 6436.0
good if you have that intention if you

6433.76 --> 6438.4400000000005
care about the environment enough that

6436.0 --> 6441.199
you care about recycling well then your

6438.44 --> 6442.879999999999
environment is going to be cleaner

6441.199 --> 6444.48
compared to places where they abs

6442.88 --> 6446.92
absolutely don't give a [ __ ] and they

6444.48 --> 6451.119
just throw out whatever junk right on

6446.92 --> 6453.56
the side of the street or right in like

6451.119 --> 6455.48
just dump it in the forest right next to

6453.56 --> 6457.96
you

6455.48 --> 6461.04
right it's a big difference it's the

6457.96 --> 6463.719
mentality of recycling and caring about

6461.04 --> 6468.0
that that actually does the good it's

6463.719 --> 6468.0
not even the process itself

6473.04 --> 6478.639
yeah and if it all ends in landfills

6475.199 --> 6478.638999999999
then it is a scam that's

6479.96 --> 6485.56
terrible on the other

6482.199 --> 6487.839999999999
hand even if it ends up in landfills

6485.56 --> 6490.639
well those landfills are then going to

6487.84 --> 6495.8
be of a very specific type of material

6490.639 --> 6501.4400000000005
that could later be dug up and then

6495.8 --> 6501.4400000000005
used so it's it's all bit tricky

6515.0 --> 6519.76
right but I mean as I said like the

6517.32 --> 6523.239
garbage problem is the garbage problem

6519.76 --> 6526.52
that's always going to be a level of

6523.239 --> 6529.759999999999
problem like always the garbage is

6526.52 --> 6532.040000000001
always going to be a problem that's not

6529.76 --> 6533.76
really the main issue of discussion

6532.04 --> 6535.84
though yeah

6533.76 --> 6540.0
climate change yeah they don't they

6535.84 --> 6543.0
don't even address the garbage okay they

6540.0 --> 6546.96
don't even bring it into the scope they

6543.0 --> 6550.44
don't even like it's not

6546.96 --> 6552.88
involved with these Eugenics climate

6550.44 --> 6559.638999999999
change policy

6552.88 --> 6559.639
people okay they don't even address it

6569.84 --> 6574.2390000000005
PR is most bless it can be recycled as

6572.4 --> 6578.239
yeah that's

6574.239 --> 6578.239
correct but it can be

6578.28 --> 6584.119
burnt you can burn plastic and just like

6581.92 --> 6587.76
you do with

6584.119 --> 6590.36
uh what do you say

6587.76 --> 6593.56
uh with coal power

6590.36 --> 6598.96
plants you scrub it

6593.56 --> 6603.04
yeah so you can have like

6598.96 --> 6605.2390000000005
junk burning power plants that run on

6603.04 --> 6608.08
plastics for example it burns the

6605.239 --> 6610.5599999999995
plastic there a lot of crappy toxic

6608.08 --> 6613.679
gases that come out of that well guess

6610.56 --> 6616.4400000000005
what you can scrub that

6613.679 --> 6619.0
[ __ ] you can scrub

6616.44 --> 6622.0
it just like you do with coal power

6619.0 --> 6622.0
plants

6629.28 --> 6634.08
that's

6631.119 --> 6639.28
right it's Thailand is burning all of

6634.08 --> 6642.04
there yeah it makes sense like what else

6639.28 --> 6644.719
are you supposed to do with it right I

6642.04 --> 6647.92
mean burying plastic is

6644.719 --> 6651.2390000000005
pointless so you might just as well just

6647.92 --> 6654.36
have a power PL burn it all

6651.239 --> 6657.079
up and then scrub the toxic materials

6654.36 --> 6657.079
that come out of

6659.04 --> 6663.4
that right that's dealing with the

6671.719 --> 6675.719
problem right

6699.28 --> 6704.639
right so you can have all these

6701.84 --> 6709.4800000000005
systems All these power plants all you

6704.639 --> 6713.4800000000005
really need is good scrubbing systems to

6709.48 --> 6717.44
clean it to make sure that no toxic crap

6713.48 --> 6721.079
gets released and that's for garbage

6717.44 --> 6723.5599999999995
recycling power plants and for coal

6721.079 --> 6728.799999999999
power plants for any type of power

6723.56 --> 6728.8
plants get scrubbers it'll clean it

6739.199 --> 6744.5199999999995
up I mean it's kind of nuts that

6752.199 --> 6758.0
ah it's still going almost thought that

6754.36 --> 6758.0
the show was going to end but it's still

6759.8 --> 6765.4400000000005
going all right but really when you

6762.679 --> 6768.84
think about it it's kind of nuts that

6765.44 --> 6772.5599999999995
the Western world even exports all its

6768.84 --> 6774.079
garbage to these third world countries

6772.56 --> 6777.320000000001
so that

6774.079 --> 6779.679
they basically burn it in power plants

6777.32 --> 6782.32
like that's kind of

6779.679 --> 6785.1990000000005
nuts I don't understand why the Western

6782.32 --> 6790.119
World doesn't actually build these

6785.199 --> 6794.48
garbage burning power plants with good

6790.119 --> 6796.0
scrubbers and then just do it

6794.48 --> 6799.44
themselves

6796.0 --> 6800.96
cleanly because you can do that you can

6799.44 --> 6803.119
burn

6800.96 --> 6807.04
garbage and

6803.119 --> 6811.079
power with it and have it be clean you

6807.04 --> 6814.96
can do that it's like every country in

6811.079 --> 6817.32
the west should have those power plants

6814.96 --> 6821.679
it's like Recycling and it generates

6817.32 --> 6824.5599999999995
power both they should all have it like

6821.679 --> 6829.0
why why would we export our garbage to

6824.56 --> 6829.0
the third world it's insane

6855.32 --> 6863.199
right so yeah that could be a solution

6858.48 --> 6865.36
garbage like clean burning

6863.199 --> 6866.638999999999
sounds crazy right but it can be done

6865.36 --> 6868.598999999999
clean

6866.639 --> 6871.56
burning

6868.599 --> 6874.76
garbage

6871.56 --> 6878.360000000001
recycling power

6874.76 --> 6882.1990000000005
plants I mean they already exist they

6878.36 --> 6885.598999999999
already exist and it should be

6882.199 --> 6888.32
perfected and made Universal across the

6885.599 --> 6890.079
West like oh you have garbage you have a

6888.32 --> 6893.639
lot of supermarkets with a lot of

6890.079 --> 6896.079
packaged stuff and food and

6893.639 --> 6896.079
stuff

6896.28 --> 6901.84
everywhere that people are going to

6898.159 --> 6903.5599999999995
throw away well then you should have a

6901.84 --> 6907.56
garbage

6903.56 --> 6910.119000000001
recycling clean power plant as well

6907.56 --> 6912.2390000000005
you're going to need electricity in

6910.119 --> 6915.92
those types of societies

6912.239 --> 6919.48
anyway you might just as well then

6915.92 --> 6919.4800000000005
just use the

6921.32 --> 6925.28
garbage for

show has been doing pretty

7074.719 --> 7082.36
good I really like the environmentalist

7078.76 --> 7084.52
subjects I'm good at it and again I am

7082.36 --> 7085.799999999999
an environmentalist I take these things

7084.52 --> 7088.119000000001
very

7085.8 --> 7091.96
serious like I've

7088.119 --> 7096.639
been it's like my field of

7091.96 --> 7098.88
worrying that I assigned myself to like

7096.639 --> 7101.32
starting 30 years

7098.88 --> 7102.8
ago and it's an ongoing issue and

7101.32 --> 7105.5199999999995
there's a lot

7102.8 --> 7108.92
that can be done a lot of positive

7105.52 --> 7108.92
developments that can be

7110.079 --> 7115.04
made oh you're going to go clutch

7116.48 --> 7120.5199999999995
okay well thanks for being

7129.639 --> 7134.32

7134.32 --> 7137.32
good

7183.44 --> 7187.919999999999
anyway take a two minute break I'll be

7185.679 --> 7187.92
right

7191.04 --> 7195.0
back for

7238.079 --> 7242.32
know was a lot quicker than two minutes

7259.28 --> 7264.84
YouTube keeps stalling this

7262.239 --> 7267.079
[ __ ] I'm going to switch browsers it's

7264.84 --> 7267.079
very

7280.92 --> 7284.88
tedious for

7329.239 --> 7333.239
right so I don't know maybe I'll I'll

7331.36 --> 7335.239
round out the show I mean if everybody's

7333.239 --> 7337.5199999999995
just going to leave again thought they

7335.239 --> 7338.718999999999

7337.52 --> 7343.76
good

7338.719 --> 7343.76
going something good to talk about

7344.079 --> 7350.719
but I mean the shows last for two hours

7346.639 --> 7353.36
and I could just round it out or I could

7350.719 --> 7355.599
the chat gives me

7353.36 --> 7361.079
something I could go another one and a

7355.599 --> 7361.079
half hour I'll leave it up to you guys

7419.04 --> 7423.639
right but

7420.48 --> 7427.839999999999
yeah however you going

7423.639 --> 7431.84
to be an environment list you know you

7427.84 --> 7435.2390000000005
got to drop this insane notion made

7431.84 --> 7439.0
predicted by absolute liars and antih

7435.239 --> 7440.799999999999
humans people that don't have a primary

7439.0 --> 7443.88
agenda to save nature they have a

7440.8 --> 7448.04
primary agenda to exterminate

7443.88 --> 7449.559
Humanity yeah they claim that

7448.04 --> 7452.36
human

7449.559 --> 7457.2390000000005
industry that produces

7452.36 --> 7460.36
CO2 methane and nitrogen that that is

7457.239 --> 7464.36
what's bad there are liars it needs to

7460.36 --> 7464.36
stop it's to stop

7464.44 --> 7470.32
harsh and I mean those people that have

7467.48 --> 7473.839999999999
forwarded that that

7470.32 --> 7477.84
includes H manbear Pig

7473.84 --> 7480.52
himself El Gore like yeah those people

7477.84 --> 7480.52
should be

7481.32 --> 7484.84
arrested criminal

7486.239 --> 7493.638999999999
conspiracy fraud on a on a wide scale

7490.679 --> 7493.639
with like disaster

7494.679 --> 7503.079
consequences and yeah climate

7498.239 --> 7505.119
change gas emission policy makers should

7503.079 --> 7509.04
be

7505.119 --> 7509.04
criminalized I said it

7509.48 --> 7514.48
criminalized it should be

7512.559 --> 7516.84
criminalized that entire thing

7514.48 --> 7518.638999999999
criminalized yeah and that includes all

7516.84 --> 7522.400000000001
the [ __ ] banks that involved

7518.639 --> 7526.639
themselves in it like yeah you're all

7522.4 --> 7530.5199999999995
being part of a a criminal antihuman

7526.639 --> 7534.36
effort and you need to

7530.52 --> 7538.079000000001
pay for that you need to

7534.36 --> 7541.558999999999
pay for the destructive influence that

7538.079 --> 7541.558999999999
you have contributed

7542.599 --> 7548.079
to cuz I'm all about the environment I

7545.8 --> 7550.320000000001
love the environment I am an

7548.079 --> 7552.558999999999
environmentalist yeah this climate

7550.32 --> 7557.558999999999
change policy

7552.559 --> 7560.88
based on like rudimentary gas emissions

7557.559 --> 7564.400000000001
from man-made industry like it has done

7560.88 --> 7570.0
nothing but destroy everything it did

7564.4 --> 7573.4
not decrease the world wide pollution it

7570.0 --> 7575.92
did not decrease it at all it you could

7573.4 --> 7580.36
actually argue it's become

7575.92 --> 7580.36
worse because of it

7582.599 --> 7588.92
and now the consequences need to be

7586.679 --> 7592.04
logically followed up

7588.92 --> 7595.639
on yeah climate change cultism needs to

7592.04 --> 7598.5199999999995
be outlawed it needs to be outlawed

7595.639 --> 7598.52
forbidden

7599.159 --> 7605.28
criminalized and then a proper form of

7602.88 --> 7608.36
environmentalism needs to take its place

7605.28 --> 7612.36
that's not fueled by

7608.36 --> 7612.36
anti-human sympathy

7612.679 --> 7618.36
yeah we need to get the Satanism out of

7616.199 --> 7618.36
the

7619.559 --> 7625.1990000000005
environmentalism yeah it's insane they

7623.239 --> 7627.32
will just destroy the environment they

7625.199 --> 7630.839999999999
will destroy the environment just so

7627.32 --> 7632.96
they can blame and demoralize mankind

7630.84 --> 7634.4800000000005
like that's what they will do with it if

7632.96 --> 7636.92
you give them the

7634.48 --> 7639.799999999999
chance because they don't really care

7636.92 --> 7643.079
about nature or pollution they just want

7639.8 --> 7646.559
to make it tough on

7643.079 --> 7648.92
humans cuz they're antihuman they're not

7646.559 --> 7652.559
really environmentalist they just want

7648.92 --> 7652.559
to make it tough on

7653.639 --> 7658.84
humans that's

7655.52 --> 7662.96
all most people shouldn't

7658.84 --> 7662.96
be in positions of

7663.28 --> 7668.88
power having any say whatsoever about

7667.0 --> 7671.599
the

7668.88 --> 7675.2390000000005
environment yeah environmentalism should

7671.599 --> 7677.8
always be a conjunction between the care

7675.239 --> 7680.638999999999
for nature and the care for

7677.8 --> 7683.88
Humanity it should be resting upon the

7680.639 --> 7687.400000000001
principles that there's a

7683.88 --> 7690.400000000001
Synergy between man and

7687.4 --> 7692.4
nature and that Synergy is what makes

7690.4 --> 7694.199
everything great it what it's what make

7692.4 --> 7697.119
quality of life great it what make

7694.199 --> 7702.32
quality of food great it what it's what

7697.119 --> 7704.719
makes our psychological Health better

7702.32 --> 7709.04
all these positive influences from the

7704.719 --> 7712.4800000000005
Synergy between nature and man but if

7709.04 --> 7714.639
then people are like no no no no man is

7712.48 --> 7716.5199999999995
bad well guess what you're not going to

7714.639 --> 7718.84
get end up with a

7716.52 --> 7722.2390000000005
Synergy you're going to end up with a

7718.84 --> 7724.079
bewildered nature that's not properly

7722.239 --> 7726.119
taken care of by

7724.079 --> 7728.88
man

7726.119 --> 7731.639
and imploding

7728.88 --> 7734.679
mankind yeah that will eventually leave

7731.639 --> 7736.88
to a Wilder form of nature that will end

7734.679 --> 7739.04
up in disaster

7736.88 --> 7741.4400000000005
yeah pure

7739.04 --> 7743.88
Wilderness you know what happens in pure

7741.44 --> 7748.44
Wilderness disasters happen in pure

7743.88 --> 7750.76
Wilderness giant forest fires that wreck

7748.44 --> 7754.36
everything and then yeah new stuff will

7750.76 --> 7756.84
grow out of it but it will also just

7754.36 --> 7756.839999999999
wreck

7757.8 --> 7763.8
everything it becomes more unpredictable

7761.92 --> 7765.719
yeah you're going to

7763.8 --> 7770.400000000001
like

7765.719 --> 7773.199
wild uncare taken nature like doesn't

7770.4 --> 7777.28
give a [ __ ] about

7773.199 --> 7780.0
species about Extinction of species like

7777.28 --> 7784.84
no it's wild and it's unpredictable if

7780.0 --> 7787.92
it's not properly car taken by man

7784.84 --> 7790.679
yeah we really care so much about

7787.92 --> 7793.92
natural diversity in all these species

7790.679 --> 7797.079
and preventing their Extinction then you

7793.92 --> 7801.719
need to keep in mind that it requires

7797.079 --> 7805.199
man to take care of nature in order for

7801.719 --> 7807.559
that diversity to be

7805.199 --> 7812.079
retained that's how it

7807.559 --> 7814.52
works you can't take care of Nature and

7812.079 --> 7817.639
then take man out of the picture it

7814.52 --> 7820.0
doesn't work like

7817.639 --> 7822.4400000000005
that real

7820.0 --> 7826.32
environmentalism is a

7822.44 --> 7829.5199999999995
conjunction between the care of man and

7826.32 --> 7830.719
the care of nature it's a Synergy it has

7829.52 --> 7834.88
to be

7830.719 --> 7834.88
both otherwise it won't

7838.079 --> 7842.119
work and that's just how it

7843.8 --> 7849.360000000001
is get the satanists out of these

7847.52 --> 7851.559
climate

7849.36 --> 7854.04
positions out of this envir

7851.559 --> 7855.320000000001
environmentalist organizations like

7854.04 --> 7859.159
they're not environmentalist

7855.32 --> 7862.639
organizations they're antihuman

7859.159 --> 7867.04
organizations if you're anti-human as an

7862.639 --> 7867.04
organization then you can't be

7877.079 --> 7881.36
environmentalist that simple

7888.92 --> 7896.8
right hope uh hope somebody out there

7892.679 --> 7900.4
agrees I mean no comment for like 50

7896.8 --> 7901.96
minutes or something so yeah maybe I'm

7900.4 --> 7905.199
just going to round out the show but I

7901.96 --> 7908.04
thought it was worth like sharing this

7905.199 --> 7912.079
view because it's

7908.04 --> 7913.36
true and hey people are probably

7912.079 --> 7916.0
sick of

7913.36 --> 7919.5199999999995
environmentalism exclusively thanks to

7916.0 --> 7922.4
this insane satanic climate change

7919.52 --> 7923.92
cult that's ravaged the world in the

7922.4 --> 7928.48
last few

7923.92 --> 7930.28
decades has done so much damage like

7928.48 --> 7933.4
visibly

7930.28 --> 7935.719
there oh we got to protect nature oh we

7933.4 --> 7940.839999999999
got to like clamp down on Humanity clamp

7935.719 --> 7943.88
down so bad but oh yeah we do want our

7940.84 --> 7945.92
rich folk to make some money so we're

7943.88 --> 7948.84
just going to cut down this protected

7945.92 --> 7952.719
Forest that the actual environmentalists

7948.84 --> 7954.599
like like protested and bled for in the

7952.719 --> 7957.32
last century we're just going to cut

7954.599 --> 7959.400000000001
that down to make a quick Buck right oh

7957.32 --> 7961.84
we're the

7959.4 --> 7964.759999999999
environmentalists no they're [ __ ]

7961.84 --> 7966.719
satanists they're satanists and they

7964.76 --> 7969.400000000001
need to be stopped and they need to be

7966.719 --> 7972.719
taken out of this position of

7969.4 --> 7976.96
power and influence over the environment

7972.719 --> 7978.52
they need to be taken out if you're

7976.96 --> 7981.4
antihuman

7978.52 --> 7983.4400000000005
philosophically you should not have

7981.4 --> 7985.799999999999
power over the

7983.44 --> 7990.4
environment you should not have any

7985.8 --> 7990.400000000001
Authority in that direction whatsoever

7997.21 --> 8000.27
[Music]

8005.63 --> 8008.669

8035.28 --> 8041.32
environmentalist episode again which

8037.76 --> 8044.280000000001
seemed to be some of my better

8041.32 --> 8046.119
episodes I have a lot to talk about with

that sort of

8046.119 --> 8053.119
thing guess that on the inside I am

8053.239 --> 8061.32
heart I've actually gone out and be have

8057.96 --> 8063.4
been part of protests

8061.32 --> 8066.96

8063.4 --> 8068.719
subjects like against Monsanto I'm very

8066.96 --> 8071.8
happy to have been part of those

8068.719 --> 8075.119
protests in Europe against Monsanto and

8071.8 --> 8078.28

8075.119 --> 8080.759999999999
outlawed in Europe I'm very happy that I

8078.28 --> 8083.239

8080.76 --> 8086.1990000000005

8083.239 --> 8088.28
it's going to try to force itself back

8086.199 --> 8092.119
right it's like oh we got rid of the GMO

8088.28 --> 8094.0
oh now they're coming in with the bugs

go yeah I'm not a vegan I eat meat I eat

8201.359 --> 8205.679
meat I'm for meat

8208.719 --> 8217.839999999998
eating yeah meat eating is

8211.8 --> 8217.84
healthy it's a very developed

8222.76 --> 8228.559000000001
industry eating meat is

8225.96 --> 8229.96
healthy if the meat is of good quality

8228.559 --> 8234.24
and if

8229.96 --> 8234.24
it's in moderation

8241.04 --> 8246.639000000001
damn poison banana what are you talking

8243.559 --> 8246.639
about theu

8264.2 --> 8271.84
virus this bananas are GMO no no they're

8269.439 --> 8275.16
not

8271.84 --> 8278.880000000001
no they're

8275.16 --> 8280.92
bread yeah they're bread they're not

8278.88 --> 8284.88
genetically

8280.92 --> 8287.319
altered it's called breeding breeding is

8284.88 --> 8287.319
like you

8288.319 --> 8292.92
keep just breeding the species until

8291.599 --> 8295.599
they

8292.92 --> 8298.319
eventually become kind of

8295.599 --> 8300.28
different right it's just called

8298.319 --> 8302.679
breeding and cross breeding it's not

8300.28 --> 8306.0
genetic

8302.679 --> 8310.319
modified genetically modified is like an

8306.0 --> 8314.16
invasive mut mutagenic

8310.319 --> 8317.559
process it damages the genetic structure

8314.16 --> 8319.28
crossbreeding doesn't do

8317.559 --> 8322.96
that

8319.28 --> 8325.479000000001
so I mean there might be some weird GMO

8322.96 --> 8328.518999999998
bananas out there for whatever reason

8325.479 --> 8331.88
but that's not the general

8328.519 --> 8333.92
banana no it's not a genetic modified

8331.88 --> 8337.598999999998
organism it's a

8333.92 --> 8339.679
crossbred organism breeding is not

8337.599 --> 8342.92
genetic

8339.679 --> 8342.92
modification it's

8354.84 --> 8362.84
breeding yeah Chihuahuas aren't

8357.479 --> 8365.08
genetically modified dogs they're bread

8362.84 --> 8367.76
freaky they're bread they're not

8365.08 --> 8367.76
genetically

8369.319 --> 8375.439
modified yeah spider goats are

8372.92 --> 8377.679
genetically modified they weren't

8375.439 --> 8381.16
crossbreed you

8377.679 --> 8384.16
can't that's a genetically modified

8381.16 --> 8388.0
organism yeah and those glowing in the

8384.16 --> 8391.08
dark monkeys with the jell fish genetics

8388.0 --> 8393.52
that's genetically modified animal they

8391.08 --> 8394.92
wen't crossbreed you can't do that

8393.52 --> 8397.68
they're not

8394.92 --> 8402.359
compatible those creatures that's

8397.68 --> 8402.359
genetic modification that's not red it's

8403.8 --> 8408.08
different okay whatever I'll just go

8406.16 --> 8410.399
back right yeah that's a good idea

8408.08 --> 8412.56
because you're wrong you don't seem to

8410.399 --> 8416.24
be able to distinguish the difference

8412.56 --> 8419.24
between cross breeding and regular

8416.24 --> 8421.64
breeding and genetically modification

8419.24 --> 8424.439
like genetic modification is a very

8421.64 --> 8427.16
different thing genetic modification

8424.439 --> 8431.0
often leads to

8427.16 --> 8435.92
sterility now even breeding like refined

8431.0 --> 8435.92
breeding often leads to sterility

8436.399 --> 8440.358999999999
too if you take it too

8441.52 --> 8449.0
far but yeah you can always just like

8446.96 --> 8451.759999999998
take a step back with the

8449.0 --> 8454.12
crossbreeding go to it more natural

8451.76 --> 8457.28
state and then just breed it with that

8454.12 --> 8459.880000000001
and then it will be able to

8457.28 --> 8464.560000000001
procreate right but once you genetically

8459.88 --> 8468.92
modify a species then often the

8464.56 --> 8468.92
procreation ability becomes lost

8473.16 --> 8478.08
permanently be wrong on you're wrong

8475.6 --> 8480.399000000001
yeah you're wrong indeed I mean you are

8478.08 --> 8482.92
wrong akumu virus you are just wrong

8480.399 --> 8484.96
yeah genetic modification is not the

8482.92 --> 8487.28
same as

8484.96 --> 8488.599999999999
crossbreeding it's just not the same

8487.28 --> 8490.28
it's

8488.6 --> 8493.08
distinctly

8490.28 --> 8497.640000000001
differentiation it's a different

8493.08 --> 8500.28
thing like with professionals that

8497.64 --> 8503.519999999999
actually do those things cross breeders

8500.28 --> 8506.24
and genetic modification experimenters

8503.52 --> 8508.640000000001
like they make a very big

8506.24 --> 8511.479
distinguishment between the two

8508.64 --> 8516.399
processes because they are

8511.479 --> 8516.399
different they're a whole class of

8519.8 --> 8524.399
differ yeah exactly would work gy bear

8522.68 --> 8529.08
if you follow that logic everything is

8524.399 --> 8529.08
genetically modified it it isn't

8543.359 --> 8549.24
I heard they use

8545.04 --> 8551.560000000001
GMO to add a fish Jean to Tomato to keep

8549.24 --> 8553.76
them I'm sure they did and I'm sure it's

8551.56 --> 8557.16
going to have some really freaky side

8553.76 --> 8558.84
effects borders boy cuz every time they

8557.16 --> 8561.96
do that kind of thing they just think oh

8558.84 --> 8565.399
yeah that sure that that works

8561.96 --> 8568.119999999999
great but then it it always has some

8565.399 --> 8571.279999999999
freaky side effect that they just can't

8568.12 --> 8575.240000000002
even tell is happening and until its

8571.28 --> 8578.479000000001
long-term influence has just settled

8575.24 --> 8581.88
in and most actual genetic

8578.479 --> 8585.119999999999
modification like leads in one way or

8581.88 --> 8587.199999999999
another to being more vulnerable to

8585.12 --> 8590.640000000001
disease

8587.2 --> 8592.52
sterility or like yeah mental

8590.64 --> 8594.519999999999
derangement

8592.52 --> 8598.2
dysfunction

8594.52 --> 8601.800000000001
like it just does that like even

8598.2 --> 8604.04
assimilating food that's genetic altered

8601.8 --> 8607.278999999999
like the things about that just have

8604.04 --> 8609.240000000002
unpredictable side effects that overall

8607.279 --> 8613.720000000001
lead to those

8609.24 --> 8615.24
factors all genetic modification just

8613.72 --> 8617.88
rushes

8615.24 --> 8622.359
towards genetic Brokenness which is

8617.88 --> 8622.358999999999
accompanied by sterility mental

8625.24 --> 8631.84
instability and other like like Mis

8628.479 --> 8634.0
functions so yeah

8631.84 --> 8635.2
don't do it don't eat genetically

8634.0 --> 8638.08
modified

8635.2 --> 8640.399000000001
organisms don't do that like just leave

8638.08 --> 8642.88
it to crossbreeding like crossbreeding

8640.399 --> 8645.039999999999
can bring you very far as to like

8642.88 --> 8648.24
possibilities and if you take it too far

8645.04 --> 8651.52
well then it will just become

8648.24 --> 8654.039999999999
sterile like if you if you crossbreed

8651.52 --> 8659.52
something too far eventually it will run

8654.04 --> 8661.640000000001
into a dead end so it has a a parameters

8659.52 --> 8665.279
naturally

8661.64 --> 8669.08
it just has the natural genetic

8665.279 --> 8671.92
parameters yeah if you if you bend it

8669.08 --> 8674.6
too far through breeding then eventually

8671.92 --> 8678.479
it will become no longer

8674.6 --> 8680.960000000001
viable for procreation it's very simple

8678.479 --> 8684.319
it's a reliable mechanism to do it that

8680.96 --> 8687.479
way that's why crossbreeding has been a

8684.319 --> 8691.199999999999
tradition for thousands of

8687.479 --> 8696.119999999999
years yeah thousands like way for

8691.2 --> 8696.12
freaking modern technology

8706.04 --> 8712.359
yeah because crossbreeding is safe it's

8710.0 --> 8715.359
genetically safe it's like if God

8712.359 --> 8718.439
doesn't allow it it won't happen genetic

8715.359 --> 8722.92
modification does not give you that

8718.439 --> 8722.92
safety it does unpredict predictable

8723.399 --> 8729.0
things like it just has long-term

8726.64 --> 8732.119999999999
consequences that cannot be

8729.0 --> 8735.2
overseen with crossbreeding

8732.12 --> 8739.12
it's way more contained that the risks

8735.2 --> 8739.12
are way more contain

8762.479 --> 8767.92
splice together humans like a plant yeah

8764.84 --> 8770.76
but that's Ting richer G that's called

8767.92 --> 8774.08
enting and yeah with organ transplant

8770.76 --> 8778.960000000001
you do actually do that it's not perfect

8774.08 --> 8778.96
though and it can come with risks

8793.88 --> 8798.399
but yeah it's a good point what working

8795.6 --> 8801.800000000001
working gy bear says it like organ

8798.399 --> 8805.358999999999
transplant are like plant splicing but

8801.8 --> 8805.358999999999
with humans it kind of is like

8808.439 --> 8814.399
that and that's right r working one gny

8811.52 --> 8820.359
bear like yeah farm

8814.399 --> 8823.68
animals are indeed cross R to give more

8820.359 --> 8825.960000000001
of the the the products that they that

8823.68 --> 8829.359
they are

8825.96 --> 8833.0
for to be better at what they're there

8829.359 --> 8833.0
for yeah

8841.0 --> 8843.359
oh

8845.2 --> 8849.800000000001
gross anyway I hope you're all enjoying

8847.64 --> 8851.68
this show today's show I think is a lot

8849.8 --> 8855.8
better than yesterday's show if you

8851.68 --> 8855.800000000001
liked it then don't forget to rogans it

8856.52 --> 8863.359
up and share

8858.68 --> 8869.12
it on any platform you deem fit which

8863.359 --> 8872.6
excludes troll platforms that just only

8869.12 --> 8872.6
care about making shitty

8872.88 --> 8878.399
memes don't share them

8875.64 --> 8881.64
there like they will show share them

8878.399 --> 8884.039999999999
there just don't don't even go there

8881.64 --> 8889.96
these places are just

8884.04 --> 8889.960000000001
sickness they're like Goblin caves

8911.56 --> 8917.08
huh that's interesting Rich yeah a

8914.279 --> 8919.800000000001
little human ner is system does kind of

8917.08 --> 8919.8
look like plant

8923.08 --> 8928.68
roots that's different from the arteries

8925.439 --> 8928.68
and veins

8942.0 --> 8947.52
whoa two pound Tomatoes Jesus woodw gy

8951.479 --> 8958.24
bear that's some serious

8954.24 --> 8958.24
Tomatoes huh

8970.96 --> 8974.919999999998
no GMO is not cross

8977.2 --> 8986.08
red no if that's cross

8980.2 --> 8986.08
red said ww gy bear said non

8987.68 --> 8995.960000000001
GMO cross braiding is not not GMO Ross

8992.24 --> 8995.96
breeding is just

8996.439 --> 9005.279
mixing yeah mixing species mixing

9002.279 --> 9007.359
varieties crossbreeding I mean it's in

9005.279 --> 9011.2
there if it's GMO then it's like

9007.359 --> 9011.2
artificially altered

9034.2 --> 9040.240000000002
and with the artificial alteration comes

9036.96 --> 9040.24
like unexpected

9042.84 --> 9047.56
traits and like dangersous that that's

9045.88 --> 9050.96
just what

9047.56 --> 9054.359
happens in the beginning in the 90s with

9050.96 --> 9056.399
mons Santa they just used Gene guns

9054.359 --> 9059.800000000001
which were like

9056.399 --> 9061.92
randomly supposedly damage the genetics

9059.8 --> 9063.72
and just see what happens and then oh it

9061.92 --> 9067.2
looks like this is kind of

9063.72 --> 9069.92
useful but then it had all like it had

9067.2 --> 9072.319000000001
tons of unexpected side effects that

9069.92 --> 9075.08
were totally

9072.319 --> 9078.439
unpredictable toxic side effects like

9075.08 --> 9080.16
really scary mutation type side effects

9078.439 --> 9082.64
that were just you wouldn't see that

9080.16 --> 9086.0
until you ate it and then people would

9082.64 --> 9089.119999999999
get really freaky side

9086.0 --> 9091.2
effects like hairs growing on the

9089.12 --> 9093.84
insides of their cheeks and [ __ ] like

9091.2 --> 9097.0
that's a known thing that happened

9093.84 --> 9099.64
really creepy with early

9097.0 --> 9102.76
GMO

9099.64 --> 9106.72
Tomatoes really

9102.76 --> 9109.359
creepy right that's because of genan

9106.72 --> 9113.399
guns and now they use crisper and so

9109.359 --> 9116.84
it's different it's not that horrendous

9113.399 --> 9119.68
anymore but it still leads roughly to

9116.84 --> 9122.880000000001
the same it still has unpredictable side

9119.68 --> 9126.56
effects and it did

9122.88 --> 9128.278999999999
does typically lead to sterility and and

9126.56 --> 9131.439
all

9128.279 --> 9132.640000000001
that like for the species that you apply

9131.439 --> 9134.359
crisper

9132.64 --> 9139.479
to

9134.359 --> 9139.479000000001
so it's just not safe

9156.439 --> 9159.960000000001
plants cross on their

9161.64 --> 9168.358999999999
really they do

9165.68 --> 9170.84
huh cucumbers and

9168.359 --> 9175.2
watermelons I didn't know that you could

9170.84 --> 9175.2
actually crossbreed them that's so

9177.84 --> 9184.72
weird that is really weird so you got

9181.6 --> 9184.720000000001
like cucumber

9197.279 --> 9203.24
watermelons that is really weird man I

9199.56 --> 9203.24
never heard of that

9204.16 --> 9209.479
interesting neither was very good yeah

9228.2 --> 9231.720000000001
probably hm

9237.87 --> 9241.049
[Music]

9258.72 --> 9262.679999999998
for for

9293.279 --> 9297.560000000001
yeah makes sense would work going to

9294.88 --> 9301.438999999998
bear it's also just an odd realization

9297.56 --> 9304.88
right that if humans weren't there to

9301.439 --> 9307.76
basically keep these crops apart let's

9304.88 --> 9311.119999999999
just say that it was just there in

9307.76 --> 9315.16
nature like it would all just start

9311.12 --> 9317.52
melting into one plant again it would

9315.16 --> 9320.479
just like crossbreed until it all

9317.52 --> 9322.84
becomes like weird un

9320.479 --> 9324.438999999998
plants of one

9322.84 --> 9327.8
type

9324.439 --> 9331.24
that I mean for the the plant itself it

9327.8 --> 9331.24
would probably be more

9331.359 --> 9337.68
efficient it would become better at

9333.96 --> 9337.679999999998
surviving in nature that

9337.92 --> 9344.64
way but I mean these plants are all

9340.76 --> 9347.319
different because we keep them like that

9344.64 --> 9350.278999999999
cuz if you just let throw it all in

9347.319 --> 9352.519999999999
nature it's going to just fuse and just

9350.279 --> 9355.479000000001
become these weird plants that wouldn't

9352.52 --> 9358.76
be super great but that would probably

9355.479 --> 9358.76
survive really well on their

9359.8 --> 9367.119999999999
own we all just turn grayish

9363.92 --> 9369.56
round well we've become like remember

9367.12 --> 9371.84
this South Park episode where like this

9369.56 --> 9373.76
portal opens up to the Future and people

9371.84 --> 9376.04
from the Future come to the Past because

9373.76 --> 9379.72
the future is so shitty well it will

9376.04 --> 9379.720000000001
become like that

9381.68 --> 9390.16
where everything's just blended into

9385.56 --> 9390.16
one whatever color

9419.76 --> 9425.24
wow weather's really come beautiful

9422.92 --> 9425.24
check it

9425.8 --> 9431.0
out weather's so pretty right now

9453.04 --> 9458.92
that's why you keep your Ginger jeans

9456.0 --> 9461.399
pure

9458.92 --> 9464.6
okay that sounds kind of

9461.399 --> 9468.16
jewy woodwork gy bear but that's that's

9464.6 --> 9468.16
cool I get it

9521.4 --> 9525.319
[Music]

9522.56 --> 9527.6
I hope everybody's enjoying the show I

9525.319 --> 9530.6
think yeah this part is definitely a lot

9527.6 --> 9534.479000000001
better than with all the freaking

9530.6 --> 9536.12
trolls that was just tedious but I'm

9534.479 --> 9538.08
liking this conversation Woodwork and

9536.12 --> 9542.240000000002
guny bear I appreciate it Richard G is

9538.08 --> 9542.24
good to have you around again

9576.76 --> 9579.84
we will not be bred

9586.6 --> 9591.76
out yeah derer why did you just leave

9589.439 --> 9591.76
Richard

9607.2 --> 9613.08
alone were they harping about climate

9610.6 --> 9613.08
change

9614.56 --> 9619.84
what the trolls no they were just being

9617.76 --> 9622.08
total scumbags

9619.84 --> 9625.479
they might be part I mean they might be

9622.08 --> 9625.479
part of the climate change

9629.16 --> 9636.72
cultists I mean it's climate man-made

9632.68 --> 9639.0
climate change Satanism is sponsored it

9636.72 --> 9644.438999999998
is something that people are getting

9639.0 --> 9646.72
paid for to to propagandize that that

9644.439 --> 9649.720000000001
that's happening it's literally

9646.72 --> 9649.72
happening

9650.04 --> 9656.359
so yeah they might be partially doing

9653.84 --> 9658.6
that because they are incentivized to do

9656.359 --> 9662.56
that to to move

9658.6 --> 9665.640000000001
against people that talk like I do about

9662.56 --> 9669.519999999999
it and that expose it for the satanic

9665.64 --> 9669.519999999999
scam that it is

9686.76 --> 9693.04
right but I mean the same people that

9689.439 --> 9698.52
that are like super anti-russia it's all

9693.04 --> 9703.92
just one group of mindless

9698.52 --> 9706.640000000001
drones oh manmade climate change

9703.92 --> 9710.24
oh we need to stop man-made climate

9706.64 --> 9713.72
change oh Russia bad we need to go to

9710.24 --> 9715.439
war with them for some [ __ ] reason

9713.72 --> 9718.438999999998
that makes no damn

9715.439 --> 9718.439
sense

9722.04 --> 9728.76
and

9725.04 --> 9732.04
yeah white people bad probably big part

9728.76 --> 9732.04
of that

9746.2 --> 9752.08
they were running new stories in the 80s

9749.439 --> 9754.24
about how the gingers would be bred out

9752.08 --> 9757.439
in 20 years yeah that's

9754.24 --> 9761.319
hilarious yeah there's no

9757.439 --> 9761.319
way doesn't work like

9768.12 --> 9772.160000000002
that for

9815.359 --> 9822.0
what okay wouldn't work any it's a weird

9819.399 --> 9822.0
way to say

9824.88 --> 9831.438999999998
it that whole narrative is about control

9828.24 --> 9834.76
and population reduction yes I know it's

9831.439 --> 9834.76
it's population

9841.56 --> 9846.24
extermination yeah mind control

9844.08 --> 9848.6
population control population

9846.24 --> 9852.479
extermination that's what the these

9848.6 --> 9852.479000000001
agendas are all about

9868.56 --> 9874.88
but I mean when you really keep asking

9871.16 --> 9878.439
it's all about just like what excuse is

9874.88 --> 9881.679999999998
going to work for you to agree to

9878.439 --> 9884.479000000001
Exterminating mankind like what kind of

9881.68 --> 9888.439
excuse do we need to make

9884.479 --> 9890.039999999999
up for you to maneuver your thinking to

9888.439 --> 9892.12
the point where you're going to Green

9890.04 --> 9894.319000000001
Light yeah we need to get rid of humans

9892.12 --> 9898.76
that's what it's all about that's what

9894.319 --> 9898.76
it's all about it's always has

9901.0 --> 9905.92
been right either you go with it not

9903.72 --> 9908.96
realizing that that is what actually

9905.92 --> 9911.359
happens or you dig further and then you

9908.96 --> 9913.88
stumble upon like oh so it is really

9911.359 --> 9916.76
humans are the problem and then you go

9913.88 --> 9920.438999999998
with that or you go against that and

9916.76 --> 9920.439
then you're the Batman

9923.439 --> 9931.359
right then you're evil and racist and

9928.2 --> 9935.439
supremacist and whatever they can think

9931.359 --> 9937.68
of because you oppose the extermination

9935.439 --> 9937.68
of

9937.72 --> 9943.479
mankind and

9939.56 --> 9947.319
that's racist and white supremacist

9943.479 --> 9949.399
and and all populist or whatever the

9947.319 --> 9951.84
[ __ ]

9949.399 --> 9955.08
like yeah you you're not a Mindless

9951.84 --> 9957.72
drone that is going to go along with

9955.08 --> 9961.16
agendas that are designed specifically

9957.72 --> 9964.319
to exterminate all life on Earth well

9961.16 --> 9964.319
then you're the bad

9975.24 --> 9981.64
person very minim effect on the planet

9979.08 --> 9985.96
yeah we have no effect on the

9981.64 --> 9989.8
planet we have no effect on the

9985.96 --> 9992.759999999998
realm we the effect that you can have on

9989.8 --> 9994.599999999999
the realm is going to be very

9992.76 --> 9997.800000000001
local or

9994.6 --> 10000.68
none right that's why I say like yeah I

9997.8 --> 10003.96
mean if you actually pollute your

10000.68 --> 10006.399
environment industrially you will know

10003.96 --> 10008.64
you will directly notice the

10006.399 --> 10011.399
consequences you will directly measure

10008.64 --> 10014.8
the poison and its influence you will

10011.399 --> 10019.16
notice life responding to the

10014.8 --> 10021.319
poison dying out not working as

10019.16 --> 10025.279
well like

10021.319 --> 10027.88
microbiology getting eviscerated like

10025.279 --> 10030.359
that's how you know that's local

10027.88 --> 10033.64
pollution and that makes

10030.359 --> 10036.359
sense well if some generic product like

10033.64 --> 10040.119999999999
CO2 or methane

10036.359 --> 10042.24
or or nitrogen

10040.12 --> 10046.399000000001
like if you have

10042.24 --> 10049.96
that well it's not going to have a

10046.399 --> 10052.96
meable influence on nature like well

10049.96 --> 10056.64
with Co you could if you like pump CO2

10052.96 --> 10059.24
into the ground like you have a a pipe

10056.64 --> 10062.278999999999
and you just have it shove it into the

10059.24 --> 10064.8
ground and then push CO2 gas into the

10062.279 --> 10066.92
ground that's actually toxic because

10064.8 --> 10071.56
that's going to like make the ground

10066.92 --> 10071.56
sour and going to kill it up that's

10071.64 --> 10078.278999999999
bad but if you just have the CO2 just

10075.12 --> 10080.880000000001
mix in with the air above ground

10078.279 --> 10085.0
gradually not too much at the same

10080.88 --> 10088.08
time then that's actually provably a

10085.0 --> 10091.12
positive influence on the on the nature

10088.08 --> 10095.24
that surrounds it like all the plants

10091.12 --> 10100.720000000001
are going to grow Greener and

10095.24 --> 10100.72
faster cuz they use that CO2

10100.8 --> 10107.24
right so you just need to

10102.84 --> 10107.24
know how to deal with these

10110.76 --> 10119.439
gases and not like try to remove

10115.84 --> 10122.04
industry that has any kind of like

10119.439 --> 10124.6
chemical process in which those

10122.04 --> 10127.399000000001
gases come forth in which those gases

10124.6 --> 10130.319
are released like no don't stop those

10127.399 --> 10133.92
processes

10130.319 --> 10139.16
just make sure that those gases find the

10133.92 --> 10141.8
right the right application the right

10139.16 --> 10145.24
place and make sure that any actual

10141.8 --> 10145.24
toxic residues are

10150.12 --> 10155.279
scrubbed fixing nitrogen in the soil

10153.479 --> 10156.84
helps a lot of

10155.279 --> 10160.08
plants

10156.84 --> 10163.16
yeah I mean nitrogen in the soil which

10160.08 --> 10167.0
is not the gas by the way is yeah that

10163.16 --> 10170.56
is part partially what helps plants grow

10167.0 --> 10174.0
but you can technically overdo it it's

10170.56 --> 10175.92
like too much manure it will also ruin

10174.0 --> 10176.68
the soil it will ruin the bacteria in

10175.92 --> 10180.2
the

10176.68 --> 10183.0
soil so there is a balance there but I

10180.2 --> 10186.479000000001
mean if you have too much of it like it

10183.0 --> 10186.479
will be very

10186.88 --> 10192.92
blatant it's influence are is measurable

10190.0 --> 10192.92
when it becomes too

10193.96 --> 10200.56
much right problem now is with these

10198.56 --> 10202.96
governments that are supposedly harping

10200.56 --> 10207.359
on about nitrogen

10202.96 --> 10208.56
policy they just lower the Border

10207.359 --> 10211.720000000001
totally

10208.56 --> 10213.64
unreasonably so instead of like yeah

10211.72 --> 10216.76
this much nitrogen actually does

10213.64 --> 10219.199999999999
measurable damage to the environment and

10216.76 --> 10222.08
that's why farmers avoid that

10219.2 --> 10225.52
level by themselves like oh no we're

10222.08 --> 10227.68
going to do it even less to the point

10225.52 --> 10230.960000000001
where

10227.68 --> 10232.84
like technically just birds flying

10230.96 --> 10235.239
around and pooping on the ground is

10232.84 --> 10238.72
going to be like an environmental

10235.239 --> 10241.119999999999
hazard by those standards literally like

10238.72 --> 10243.519999999999
that's the standard that they've

10241.12 --> 10246.04
attained these Environmental Policy

10243.52 --> 10248.6
makers in governments like which is

10246.04 --> 10250.04
totally unreasonable it's sabotage it's

10248.6 --> 10254.2
environmental

10250.04 --> 10258.239000000001
sabotage and it's a sabotage on

10254.2 --> 10258.239000000001
agriculture it's criminal it's

10261.04 --> 10269.080000000002
Marxist it should be halted and there's

10264.8 --> 10272.64
people should be persecuted for their

10269.08 --> 10276.88
blatant and conspired

10272.64 --> 10279.479
crime which is what that is yeah

10276.88 --> 10282.358999999999
environmental policy

10279.479 --> 10285.319
sabotage that's a

10282.359 --> 10288.84
crime that's a crime it should be

10285.319 --> 10288.84
persecuted as a

10291.84 --> 10297.72
crime and the Damage that they have

10294.56 --> 10302.519999999999
caused like on Farmers by closing them

10297.72 --> 10305.358999999999
down for those reasons should be

10302.52 --> 10307.319000000001
compensated it should be compensated

10305.359 --> 10310.76
those people that have done that should

10307.319 --> 10314.278999999999
have like empty their pockets and their

10310.76 --> 10314.279
Assets in order

10315.279 --> 10321.52
to repair the damage that they've caused

10318.76 --> 10325.16
with their criminal

10321.52 --> 10325.16
policy which is what it

10334.439 --> 10338.880000000001
is yeah would work going I know I know

10337.0 --> 10341.52
yeah the plants interact with did and

10338.88 --> 10343.8
all that there's fine balances and

10341.52 --> 10345.319000000001
farmers and Growers have all have it

10343.8 --> 10348.56
worked

10345.319 --> 10353.16
out yeah in very refined

10348.56 --> 10353.16
way they know exactly how this all

10356.84 --> 10364.8
works and yeah nitrogen is just

10360.0 --> 10368.64
a just like CO2 is an essential

10364.8 --> 10370.438999999998
ingredient in agriculture

10368.64 --> 10372.439
yeah you need some nitrogen in the

10370.439 --> 10375.439
grounds for the plants to grow you also

10372.439 --> 10376.64
need some CO2 in the air for the plants

10375.439 --> 10379.64
to

10376.64 --> 10379.64
grow

10386.12 --> 10392.2
both attempting to defraud the populace

10389.359 --> 10396.68
by lying about non-existent consequences

10392.2 --> 10396.68
should be criminal as well yes

10409.359 --> 10417.12
G be I mean in a way it should be very

10412.64 --> 10419.519999999999
simple if they literally make up studies

10417.12 --> 10422.92
that are like blatantly

10419.52 --> 10424.6
fraud just to do this kind of thing that

10422.92 --> 10427.6
should be criminal and should be

10424.6 --> 10429.04
punished harshly like if you're like

10427.6 --> 10432.800000000001
making up

10429.04 --> 10436.720000000001
excuses and using fraudulent studies or

10432.8 --> 10439.72
whatever to back up your case that's a

10436.72 --> 10443.239
crime should be punished harshly like

10439.72 --> 10444.88
you're trying to fraud things to

10443.239 --> 10447.279
manipulate the

10444.88 --> 10450.519999999999
people into doing something that's

10447.279 --> 10453.359
detrimental to everybody like that's

10450.52 --> 10456.08
criminal like that should be fully

10453.359 --> 10456.08
criminally

10456.319 --> 10462.88
prosecuted and in my opinion punished

10459.399 --> 10467.64
very very harshly yeah that's

10462.88 --> 10467.64
environmental and human antihuman

10468.2 --> 10477.279
crime it's really it's really really

10472.72 --> 10479.119999999999
evil and should be prosecuted harshly

10477.279 --> 10481.399000000001
not saying necessarily like death

10479.12 --> 10485.279
penalty [ __ ] or whatever but I mean it

10481.399 --> 10490.319
should be like

10485.279 --> 10490.319000000001
yeah definitely prison time

10491.88 --> 10497.08
and like a permanent

10493.92 --> 10499.359
record with that like this person lied

10497.08 --> 10501.319
here's the the crimes they committed and

10499.359 --> 10503.84
like yeah

10501.319 --> 10506.76
that's on record

10503.84 --> 10510.6
forever like this person is basically an

10506.76 --> 10510.6
environmental Criminal

10519.0 --> 10523.399
grow mushrooms in the garden they

10520.68 --> 10526.720000000001
breathe in oxygen and breathe out CO2 oh

10523.399 --> 10526.72
yeah I guess that could

10526.92 --> 10531.84
work you could let the plants do all of

10529.64 --> 10535.64
it Woodwork in guny bear or you could

10531.84 --> 10538.439
like insert industrial product I mean I

10535.64 --> 10543.16
really think there is a future in just

10538.439 --> 10546.68
like collecting CO2 out of out of the

10543.16 --> 10550.52
air in industrial processes like coal

10546.68 --> 10553.319
power plants just extracting that CO2

10550.52 --> 10557.279
not all of it but just like a chunk of

10553.319 --> 10559.6
it storing it in tanks and then

10557.279 --> 10562.92
just sell

10559.6 --> 10562.92
them for

10563.0 --> 10568.0
Growers right now there's this just this

10565.68 --> 10572.12
insane taboo on using

10568.0 --> 10575.64
CO2 it's just this taboo because of the

10572.12 --> 10578.6
climate change fraudulent policies

10575.64 --> 10580.119999999999
everywhere but it should be like r

10578.6 --> 10583.84
available

10580.12 --> 10587.12
industrially for Growers CU it

10583.84 --> 10590.359
helps it helps growing

10587.12 --> 10592.640000000001
plants it should be readily available

10590.359 --> 10592.640000000001
for

10594.359 --> 10601.92
Growers right just like regular

10598.239 --> 10605.16
manure is readily available for

10601.92 --> 10607.04
Growers right I mean even now with

10605.16 --> 10609.76
supposed nitrogen policy they're still

10607.04 --> 10613.800000000001
just like yeah manure readily

10609.76 --> 10617.08
available they might be more costly

10613.8 --> 10619.358999999999
because of stupid policy taxes or

10617.08 --> 10621.2
whatever on it environmental ta but it's

10619.359 --> 10625.12
still right there it's just a readily

10621.2 --> 10628.52
available thing for Growers well CO2

10625.12 --> 10632.479000000001
should be readily available for Growers

10628.52 --> 10634.960000000001
can extract it from industrial

10632.479 --> 10639.399
processes extract it from the air and

10634.96 --> 10642.519999999999
then just have it stored and for sale

10639.399 --> 10645.84
I mean you could even like

10642.52 --> 10649.319000000001
just create a little micro industry out

10645.84 --> 10653.16
of it and then just use the profits from

10649.319 --> 10656.92
the sales of the CO2 to

10653.16 --> 10656.92
help feed the

10658.399 --> 10663.76
environmentalist checking and all that

10660.88 --> 10665.278999999999
like the cost that come right have a

10663.76 --> 10667.880000000001
little industry out of the

10665.279 --> 10670.12
environmentalism like that that will

10667.88 --> 10673.199999999999
help help sustain the

10670.12 --> 10676.52
environmentalism helps sustain the

10673.2 --> 10678.720000000001
processes right not just be a drain on

10676.52 --> 10681.479000000001
the the coffers of

10678.72 --> 10684.679999999998
society because environmentalism does

10681.479 --> 10686.64
cost money it is a luxury that is

10684.68 --> 10688.800000000001
something that you should keep in mind

10686.64 --> 10693.039999999999
it's a luxury but it's very

10688.8 --> 10693.039999999999
important like it makes everything

10693.76 --> 10698.880000000001
better but environmentalism only really

10696.88 --> 10702.039999999999
comes into play

10698.88 --> 10704.319
when you can afford to do that and then

10702.04 --> 10706.960000000001
everything becomes better and higher

10704.319 --> 10708.56
quality but if you can't afford to do it

10706.96 --> 10710.839999999998
you can't afford to do it and then you

10708.56 --> 10714.199999999999
got to go with rudimentary things that

10710.84 --> 10718.239
are going to be more polluting

10714.2 --> 10718.239000000001
unfortunately that's what happens in the

10719.12 --> 10725.800000000001
world so it does require a little

10722.399 --> 10728.278999999999
investment but you could make these

10725.8 --> 10730.92
industries automatically feed the

10728.279 --> 10733.12
environmentalism without just being oh

10730.92 --> 10735.56
everybody has to pay extra taxes to just

10733.12 --> 10738.439
to keep the environmentalism

10735.56 --> 10742.239
going it's just a shame like everything

10738.439 --> 10742.239
could be more efficient

10745.399 --> 10751.72
everything one thing we never run out of

10747.8 --> 10754.278999999999
animal turds yeah I

10751.72 --> 10756.399
know

10754.279 --> 10759.279
although I

10756.399 --> 10761.278999999999
mean if there's an eat the bug's

10759.279 --> 10763.16
transition then eventually you might

10761.279 --> 10765.880000000001
even run out of animal turrets and then

10763.16 --> 10769.88
you got a real

10765.88 --> 10772.16
problem cuz bug turrets is not good for

10769.88 --> 10773.72
the ground there's not a lot of nitrogen

10772.16 --> 10777.16
in

10773.72 --> 10780.84
that AKP great stream

10777.16 --> 10780.84
thanks I'm enjoying

10781.16 --> 10785.68
it good to see you

10788.68 --> 10792.68
right I'm going to take two break I'll

10790.2 --> 10792.68
be right

10816.96 --> 10819.96
back

10846.92 --> 10849.92
for

10876.92 --> 10880.88
e e

10919.2 --> 10921.68
and I'm

10923.04 --> 10929.319000000001
back being busy

10925.92 --> 10932.439
okay well don't forget to rogans it up

10929.319 --> 10935.68
and share the show and yeah please

10932.439 --> 10938.960000000001
people also donate to my PayPal would be

10935.68 --> 10938.960000000001
very helpful

10941.479 --> 10949.16
not doing zbug thing ever good we

10944.279 --> 10949.16
shouldn't it's it's a terrible idea

10969.88 --> 10974.319
thanks well I'm city Folk too would

10972.16 --> 10976.8
working gy bear and I ain't having no

10974.319 --> 10980.479
Cricket dinner

10976.8 --> 10980.479
thanks I'm not doing

10987.04 --> 10995.479000000001
it it's not healthy it's unhealthy it's

10992.239 --> 10998.52
unhealthy it will never be healthy it

10995.479 --> 11003.039999999999
will never be healthy

10998.52 --> 11006.800000000001
like crickets are hyper prone that like

11003.04 --> 11009.92
most bugs are like way more prone to

11006.8 --> 11012.599999999999
parasites yeah and they all have

11009.92 --> 11014.6
chattin which is like in their shells

11012.6 --> 11017.6
you can't get rid of it they won't

11014.6 --> 11020.6
industrially be able to get rid of it

11017.6 --> 11022.439
and it's very toxic and its influence on

11020.6 --> 11026.239
your entire

11022.439 --> 11029.319
system like it is like almost as toxic

11026.239 --> 11032.199999999999
as just eating GMO

11029.319 --> 11035.039999999999
vegetables like and you'll they'll never

11032.2 --> 11038.2
be able to get that negative influence

11035.04 --> 11038.2
out of it like

11038.64 --> 11046.92
ever so it's never a viable alternative

11043.56 --> 11052.399
ever it's a toxic food it will always be

11046.92 --> 11058.479
a form of toxic food and there is

11052.399 --> 11058.479
no human reason to ever accept it

11062.76 --> 11069.6
you mail me some

11064.8 --> 11073.16
eggs and a tomato what nah don't don't

11069.6 --> 11076.92
do that I mean it's across the ocean

11073.16 --> 11078.96
it's two pound tomato I mean the idea is

11076.92 --> 11082.88
pretty cool but I it's probably going to

11078.96 --> 11086.8
end up rotten when it's here

11082.88 --> 11089.64
so I appreciate the gesture y though

11086.8 --> 11089.64
thank you for that

11100.64 --> 11103.64
h

11120.6 --> 11125.68
oh if it gets to zbgs or nothing

11126.0 --> 11131.6
no if it gets to zbgs then there is not

11129.359 --> 11134.800000000001
going to be any international

11131.6 --> 11137.359
shipping in order to be able to send me

11134.8 --> 11140.239
that by the time that we're literally

11137.359 --> 11142.720000000001
forced un bugs like they can only do

11140.239 --> 11145.239
that if there is no other option because

11142.72 --> 11147.88
nobody will do it

11145.239 --> 11149.119999999999
nobody yeah

11147.88 --> 11151.8
by the time that you're going to be

11149.12 --> 11155.52
forced to eat bugs that means you're in

11151.8 --> 11155.519999999999
a prison system

11155.56 --> 11161.64
effectively yet nobody's going to mail

11158.0 --> 11163.399
you any real food by the time that that

11161.64 --> 11167.399
happens

11163.399 --> 11169.76
so it's a nice idea but it it's not

11167.399 --> 11173.439
going to work but I don't think it'll

11169.76 --> 11173.439
get to that point

11184.12 --> 11189.279
I think that just yeah I mean the

11187.319 --> 11192.239
politicians and the people that are

11189.279 --> 11195.16
forcing that [ __ ] they're all going to

11192.239 --> 11199.08
get get just beaten up and mash to a

11195.16 --> 11199.08
pulp before we get to that

11199.68 --> 11208.0
point happened to the prime minister in

11204.479 --> 11210.08
Denmark just recently yeah it's happened

11208.0 --> 11213.439
it's not just these [ __ ]

11210.08 --> 11216.2
opposition party people that are against

11213.439 --> 11219.880000000001
all this that are getting beaten up by

11216.2 --> 11222.359
MK Ultra mentally ill people directed by

11219.88 --> 11225.519999999999
military industrial complex and all that

11222.359 --> 11230.04
and no

11225.52 --> 11233.04
like it's happening it's starting to

11230.04 --> 11233.04
happen

11234.08 --> 11240.96
yeah I was surprised to to notice that

11237.399 --> 11244.039999999999
that it's took so long but yeah these

11240.96 --> 11246.119999999999
[ __ ] liberal

11244.04 --> 11248.68
politicians they're going to get beaten

11246.12 --> 11252.359
up and it's going to get more and once

11248.68 --> 11255.359
the people start to get the sniff of it

11252.359 --> 11257.04
like they won't be able to just go

11255.359 --> 11259.640000000001
anywhere

11257.04 --> 11262.640000000001
anymore cuz they're all going to be

11259.64 --> 11265.358999999999
beaten up wherever they go

11262.64 --> 11268.358999999999
eventually like people are going to just

11265.359 --> 11271.479000000001
release

11268.359 --> 11274.359
and then it's like oh oh oh you want us

11271.479 --> 11277.319
to do this oh okay why don't you come

11274.359 --> 11279.880000000001
out of your house huh why don't you come

11277.319 --> 11280.92
out of your house and see what we're

11279.88 --> 11283.839999999998
going to

11280.92 --> 11286.16
do cuz it's going to get to that point

11283.84 --> 11289.439
it's it's already getting it's getting

11286.16 --> 11291.239
there slowly right who we got a protest

11289.439 --> 11293.0
nonviolent oh we got a protest

11291.239 --> 11294.479
nonviolent yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

11293.0 --> 11298.239
definitely no

11294.479 --> 11301.358999999999
organized violence Yeah but I I

11298.239 --> 11305.08
mean these people that oppose us they

11301.359 --> 11307.960000000001
are just going to get beaten up more

11305.08 --> 11310.84
more and more by just random people that

11307.96 --> 11313.88
are not associated with any political

11310.84 --> 11317.08
group or anything it's just people that

11313.88 --> 11320.278999999999
just like yeah they they heard the

11317.08 --> 11322.88
news they watch the social media and

11320.279 --> 11325.640000000001
they're going to beat those [ __ ]

11322.88 --> 11328.119999999999
antihuman anti-nationalist Marxist

11325.64 --> 11330.278999999999
traitor politicians up they're going to

11328.12 --> 11331.800000000001
beat them up and then eventually it's

11330.279 --> 11333.0
going to be more than just a little

11331.8 --> 11335.519999999999
beating it's going to be a little

11333.0 --> 11338.76
mutilation and then a few deaths will

11335.52 --> 11339.84
happen and then a lot of deaths if you

11338.76 --> 11343.399
don't

11339.84 --> 11346.399
stop if you insist on continuing the

11343.399 --> 11349.319
antihuman policies and force it upon

11346.399 --> 11352.64
anybody then eventually just the getting

11349.319 --> 11355.319
beaten up will transition

11352.64 --> 11358.76
into yeah getting a bit mutilated here

11355.319 --> 11362.64
and there and then all deaths oh oh this

11358.76 --> 11365.16
poor oh the poor Minister oh oh he died

11362.64 --> 11368.519999999999
oh yeah yeah why why would that be could

11365.16 --> 11371.08
it be because this they are were

11368.52 --> 11374.279
extremely antihuman and

11371.08 --> 11375.96
like Pro pedophilia and all that could

11374.279 --> 11379.279
it have to do with

11375.96 --> 11381.96
that no no was no it was just hatden

11379.279 --> 11383.12
bigotry of course yeah it's going to

11381.96 --> 11385.88
happen

11383.12 --> 11389.239000000001
though it's already

11385.88 --> 11393.358999999999
happening yeah people are getting beaten

11389.239 --> 11394.72
up for being part of the antihuman

11393.359 --> 11398.720000000001
Marxist

11394.72 --> 11401.8
agendas and eventually it's going to be

11398.72 --> 11405.56
most of them and then like oh we just

11401.8 --> 11408.599999999999
want to help the climate we just want to

11405.56 --> 11410.199999999999
save the Earth why don't you do our

11408.6 --> 11412.52
policies it's like yeah why don't you

11410.2 --> 11416.76
come over to your house and find

11412.52 --> 11420.0
out huh why you come walk up to us and

11416.76 --> 11424.2
see see how we respond to your uh your

11420.0 --> 11424.2
good will about the planet

11447.52 --> 11450.52
e

11483.2 --> 11486.16
oh maybe I got it

11492.319 --> 11496.96
wrong I'm not

11494.279 --> 11500.359
sure like what their position is it's

11496.96 --> 11502.278999999999
just that I mean these like all the

11500.359 --> 11504.479000000001
government eventually right I mean now

11502.279 --> 11508.479000000001
it's like oh

11504.479 --> 11510.199999999999
the the populist got attacked

11508.479 --> 11511.679999999998
they're sticking up for the people

11510.2 --> 11514.880000000001
because of the military industrial

11511.68 --> 11518.2
complex etc etc well eventually it's

11514.88 --> 11520.839999999998
like people are just going to hate all

11518.2 --> 11524.2
government all politicians and then it's

11520.84 --> 11526.399
like yeah it's like oh you're right wing

11524.2 --> 11529.6
or your left wing like we don't care

11526.399 --> 11531.479
anymore you've all contributed to life

11529.6 --> 11535.08
becoming hell on Earth and you we are

11531.479 --> 11537.8
going to pay make you pay for it all of

11535.08 --> 11540.88
you with your incest

11537.8 --> 11543.278999999999
blabbering and not solving anything and

11540.88 --> 11546.679999999998
allowing everything to become

11543.279 --> 11547.800000000001
worse and then eventually you all get

11546.68 --> 11550.92
beaten

11547.8 --> 11554.759999999998
up all of

11550.92 --> 11558.04
it yeah whether you're supposedly a

11554.76 --> 11563.12
lefty or a populist or whatever the [ __ ]

11558.04 --> 11566.0
you are like you're not making things

11563.12 --> 11568.399000000001
better people are going to eventually

11566.0 --> 11571.08
become so sick of all politics they

11568.399 --> 11573.96
won't even care anymore what supposed

11571.08 --> 11576.84
[ __ ] side you are you will just get

11573.96 --> 11579.239
beaten up for being part of traitors

11576.84 --> 11579.239
Against

11579.479 --> 11585.76
Humanity traitors against your nation

11583.0 --> 11588.8
letting all that crap

11585.76 --> 11591.800000000001
happen all these psychotic

11588.8 --> 11591.8
anti-nationalist

11592.16 --> 11598.16
policies yeah so whether this Danish

11596.0 --> 11600.2
Prime Minister is like like a supposed

11598.16 --> 11602.479
good person or not it doesn't even

11600.2 --> 11606.239000000001
matter really in that

11602.479 --> 11610.0
context it just doesn't matter

11606.239 --> 11611.88
anymore people won't care anymore

11610.0 --> 11614.76
whether somebody's a liberal or a

11611.88 --> 11617.08
populist like they'll just start beating

11614.76 --> 11618.960000000001
people up that are from government

11617.08 --> 11621.8
because the entire government is

11618.96 --> 11621.8
betraying the

11622.399 --> 11627.08
people that's what's going to happen

11627.76 --> 11632.64
and I'm kind of looking forward to more

11629.56 --> 11632.64

11656.319 --> 11659.8
Nations and destroys

11660.0 --> 11667.399
people yeah you're all part of

11664.52 --> 11670.279
it and then eventually it's like yeah if

11670.279 --> 11676.12
opposition like including

violence like eventually politicians

11676.12 --> 11682.04
that don't call out for violence against

11679.04 --> 11686.399000000001
the anti-national antihuman

11682.04 --> 11689.080000000002
marxists politicians that won't call out

11686.399 --> 11691.8
call for violence against them they will

11689.08 --> 11693.92
be not trusted and they will be

11691.8 --> 11695.479
considered to be part of the problem

11693.92 --> 11698.04
that's what you'll end up with If this

11695.479 --> 11700.92
just all keeps going yeah it's not that

11698.04 --> 11703.080000000002

these

11862.319 --> 11868.16
people collectively with a group just

11865.08 --> 11871.64
people like we're [ __ ] sick of these

11868.16 --> 11874.439
[ __ ] politicians all of

11871.64 --> 11876.88
them I'm sick of

11874.439 --> 11878.6
politicians that are supposed to be

11876.88 --> 11881.92
scoring great in the

11878.6 --> 11885.0
elections then they don't get any seats

11881.92 --> 11889.76
it's obviously fraudulently taken from

11885.0 --> 11889.76
them stolen and they they don't even say

11891.0 --> 11898.479
anything they don't even say about how

11895.12 --> 11901.880000000001
the elections are blatant L being

11898.479 --> 11904.84
manipulated and robbed from very

11901.88 --> 11909.039999999999
specific political

11904.84 --> 11911.76
parties it makes me hate all politicians

11909.04 --> 11913.68
it makes me like oh so then you are part

11911.76 --> 11916.52
of the

11913.68 --> 11919.399
problem you were control opposition and

11916.52 --> 11921.76
then when you lost because of Fraud and

11919.399 --> 11926.439
manipulation you didn't do anything

11921.76 --> 11929.64
against it that's exactly what you're

11926.439 --> 11931.04
fighting against loves loves to happen

11929.64 --> 11933.88
they love

11931.04 --> 11936.04
that they stole it and and you're

11933.88 --> 11939.039999999999
letting them get away with it and that

11936.04 --> 11939.04
makes you part of the

11951.68 --> 11959.68
problem yeah that is nuts woodwork gy

11954.76 --> 11959.68
bear I know it's terrible for

12011.96 --> 12015.679999999998
right so I think I'm going to round out

12013.439 --> 12017.880000000001
the show I kind of want to get some

12015.68 --> 12021.52
lunch

12017.88 --> 12025.438999999998
all right uh there may be

12021.52 --> 12028.359
a a night owl show this weekend probably

12025.439 --> 12031.56
Sunday with clutch I don't know if he's

12028.359 --> 12034.640000000001
still going to be able to have time to

12031.56 --> 12037.8
do that but I kind of wanted to do

12034.64 --> 12041.399
another night out show with him and like

12037.8 --> 12041.399
maybe talk about religion a

12044.16 --> 12049.72
bit we'll see it it

12047.359 --> 12052.239
I hope it happens it may happen it may

12049.72 --> 12054.039999999999
not happen we'll see but if it's going

12052.239 --> 12058.439
to happen it's probably going to be

12054.04 --> 12060.080000000002
tomorrow I'll let you guys know as soon

12058.439 --> 12062.800000000001
as I

12060.08 --> 12065.279
know with certainty when clutch is going

12062.8 --> 12067.84
to be available for

12065.279 --> 12070.04
that maybe not this weekend and then

12067.84 --> 12073.04
I'll probably do it next weekend or

12070.04 --> 12073.04
something

12078.92 --> 12084.04
it took just as long to get to him as if

12081.72 --> 12087.278999999999
I would have taken a boat and handed it

12084.04 --> 12088.960000000001
to him person yeah yes I know woodw

12087.279 --> 12090.479000000001
going to be it's ridiculous what they're

12088.96 --> 12095.039999999999
doing

12090.479 --> 12095.039999999999
here absolutely ridiculous

12109.359 --> 12114.16
yeah the shipping how that works here is

12111.479 --> 12114.16
just

12117.64 --> 12123.198999999999
dysfunctional but they just want they're

12120.8 --> 12125.92
doing it because they're like insisting

12123.199 --> 12128.16
that you get all your products from

12125.92 --> 12131.08
within Europe

12128.16 --> 12135.96
somehow that's why they're doing

12131.08 --> 12137.08
that it's basically a super pro-an

12135.96 --> 12140.56
policy

12137.08 --> 12142.84
to just tax and delay shipping from

12140.56 --> 12144.76
other countries although they don't

12142.84 --> 12148.199
really it doesn't even take that long

12144.76 --> 12151.76
like from products from China it's even

12148.199 --> 12153.800000000001
more crazy like you just get some thing

12151.76 --> 12157.239
from China through some store and it

12153.8 --> 12157.239
gets there like in a

12158.76 --> 12164.800000000001
week but when it comes from the United

12161.399 --> 12170.239
States it can take months I mean that's

12164.8 --> 12170.239
crazy that is genuinely nuts

12200.279 --> 12203.560000000001
hey fiber outs good to see

12218.16 --> 12222.68
you hope everybody's enjoying the show

12220.96 --> 12225.88
if you are please don't forget to Rogan

12222.68 --> 12225.880000000001
it up

12229.64 --> 12233.68
got pretty good votes today that's

12236.319 --> 12242.56
nice wait

12239.16 --> 12244.72
what how the hell did it go down to four

12242.56 --> 12244.72
what

12245.439 --> 12250.64
happened was just registering 10

12259.479 --> 12263.519999999999
is that some troll maneuver

12287.399 --> 12289.96
that's just

12295.319 --> 12302.479
weird yeah well nobody cares duper yeah

12299.08 --> 12305.72
we know Eric dubet Eric dubet hates

12302.479 --> 12310.039999999999
Christianity hate everything about it

12305.72 --> 12310.039999999999
nosism is the real Christianity yeah

12313.439 --> 12319.279
wrong I don't care for

12354.319 --> 12357.72
not that it matters even that much

12356.12 --> 12361.279
because it's

12357.72 --> 12363.438999999998
like I mean regular Christian with the

12361.279 --> 12365.92
weird chance and you have to say the

12363.439 --> 12370.0
riddle or you're going to go to hell

12365.92 --> 12370.0
like that's not real Christianity

12374.0 --> 12379.0
either but I mean gnostic at the core

12377.16 --> 12385.439
basically says that you just have to

12379.0 --> 12385.439
realize that you're God it's absolutely

12396.12 --> 12403.439
ridiculous like you can't even call that

12398.88 --> 12403.438999999998
Christianity it's just not

12416.96 --> 12424.599999999999
am I a Christian well not by any

12420.96 --> 12426.599999999999
recognized official standard out there I

12424.6 --> 12431.720000000001
just follow the path of

12426.6 --> 12431.720000000001
Christ very my own very specific type of

12432.0 --> 12436.64
interpretation but in the

12434.12 --> 12437.84
foundation in a way I'm kind of more

12436.64 --> 12441.278999999999
like a

12437.84 --> 12441.279
deist in that

12459.04 --> 12465.12
sense that's being a Christian following

12461.76 --> 12465.12
Christ teachings

12468.04 --> 12476.319000000001
right well I follow Jesus's words

12473.0 --> 12479.359
specifically so

12476.319 --> 12482.88
I like there's a lot of things that are

12479.359 --> 12486.439
said about him by other people or even

12482.88 --> 12488.92
people in the book and I all like I

12486.439 --> 12492.04
ignore

12488.92 --> 12494.52
that unless it it does no

12492.04 --> 12497.76
harm there's just a lot

12494.52 --> 12500.6
of opinion about him and all that that I

12497.76 --> 12503.56
think are just

12500.6 --> 12505.720000000001
manipulative or contradictory to what

12503.56 --> 12509.278999999999
Jesus actually

12505.72 --> 12512.358999999999
said and I'm just abundantly aware of

12509.279 --> 12518.68
that very specific aspect of

12512.359 --> 12523.56
it how man deludes Christ teachings like

12518.68 --> 12523.56
even within the very book it happens

12536.52 --> 12541.880000000001
if they were God yeah it's just it's

12539.6 --> 12545.68
nonsense what we going to be I mean

12541.88 --> 12548.198999999999
nostics thinking they are God is just

12545.68 --> 12550.279
it's literally a

12548.199 --> 12553.720000000001
religion that has

12550.279 --> 12556.720000000001
megalomania as an anle it's [ __ ]

12553.72 --> 12556.72
insane

12560.04 --> 12564.279
like that's your end goal it's

12565.56 --> 12571.76
nuts yeah no real Christianity is to be

12570.04 --> 12578.0
with

12571.76 --> 12580.72
God Like Jesus with God not to be God it

12578.0 --> 12584.72
makes no sense it makes just as much

12580.72 --> 12587.0
sense as like oh no Jesus Is God he is

12584.72 --> 12588.56
the father and the son and it makes no

12587.0 --> 12592.52
[ __ ] sense but you got to believe it

12588.56 --> 12596.76
or you go to hell yeah well to say oh I

12592.52 --> 12600.960000000001
am God makes just as much sense as that

12596.76 --> 12605.08
nonsense riddle it's

12600.96 --> 12608.08
insane and it drives you to be

12605.08 --> 12611.68
megalomaniacal and it gives a lot of

12608.08 --> 12614.0
incentives to your ego and the devil

12611.68 --> 12616.92
through your

12614.0 --> 12620.12
ego to become megal

12616.92 --> 12622.12
mancal it's not Christianity it's not

12620.12 --> 12625.84
the right way if you think that you're

12622.12 --> 12625.84
an idiot you're a

12626.08 --> 12634.239
fool yeah you can be with God you are

12630.04 --> 12638.239000000001
not God God is not a man not God is Not

12634.239 --> 12643.239
all men God is not one man God is not

12638.239 --> 12646.76
man God is there out there outside of

12643.239 --> 12650.72
physical reality he designed all of this

12646.76 --> 12655.12
we are part of his design he can be with

12650.72 --> 12660.039999999999
us he is not

12655.12 --> 12664.640000000001
us I mean this is just rudimentary basic

12660.04 --> 12667.080000000002
logic man I like I I can't believe that

12664.64 --> 12668.119999999999
like the entirety of gnosticism just

12667.08 --> 12673.52
like

12668.12 --> 12676.199
ignores rudimentary logic like that it's

12673.52 --> 12679.399000000001
[ __ ] and I think Eric de is kind of

12676.199 --> 12682.08
[ __ ] for siding with that it it is

12679.399 --> 12685.278999999999
dumb it is dumb it is

12682.08 --> 12688.199
dim it will make you more

12685.279 --> 12691.199
stupid yeah that's what Satan does

12688.199 --> 12693.439
that's what lies do illogic what does it

12691.199 --> 12695.359
do to you it makes you dumb you believe

12693.439 --> 12698.56
in something that makes no sense that

12695.359 --> 12701.04
cannot be logically Justified well that

12698.56 --> 12704.96
means you break

12701.04 --> 12707.960000000001
discontinue the the process the the path

12704.96 --> 12710.759999999998
of logic within the information if you

12707.96 --> 12713.358999999999
cut off a path but yet you hold on to it

12710.76 --> 12717.04
if you cut off logic yet you hold on to

12713.359 --> 12718.56
a form of reasoning it will

12717.04 --> 12721.12
palpably

12718.56 --> 12726.439
provably make you

12721.12 --> 12730.0
dumb it's provably that happens yeah

12726.439 --> 12733.56
that's not just oh oh a threat it's a

12730.0 --> 12736.319
it's a virtual threat it's like oh you

12733.56 --> 12741.16
God will punish you for that no no it

12736.319 --> 12741.16
provably palpably makes you

12743.8 --> 12748.64
dumb and the Dumber you become the more

12746.56 --> 12752.08
delusional you

12748.64 --> 12755.8
become because you keep holding on to a

12752.08 --> 12758.96
a piece of reasoning that cannot be

12755.8 --> 12762.039999999999
logically Justified and when you do that

12758.96 --> 12766.519999999999
and you hold on to it your ego gets more

12762.04 --> 12769.960000000001
power your intellect gets less grasp you

12766.52 --> 12773.439
become dumb and

12769.96 --> 12773.438999999998
delusional that's a

12780.16 --> 12785.359
fact Lord Walter Russell saying

12782.96 --> 12785.358999999999
something

12789.64 --> 12797.479
what okay well Walter Russell's kind of

12794.239 --> 12800.08
weird interesting but

12797.479 --> 12802.119999999999
weird what I'm saying is what I'm saying

12800.08 --> 12804.439
I don't know if that's based on what

12802.12 --> 12808.479000000001
anybody else has been saying out there

12804.439 --> 12812.04
I'm saying it yeah I

12808.479 --> 12816.319
spontaneously generated it the inside

12812.04 --> 12820.12
from scratch I don't quote from books I

12816.319 --> 12822.96
don't take pieces of intellect

12820.12 --> 12826.640000000001
intellectual Heritage from other

12822.96 --> 12829.599999999999
individuals I generate it

12826.64 --> 12831.8
everything comes to me it all sits in

12829.6 --> 12833.960000000001
the background as like my personal

12831.8 --> 12835.0
akashic record of all things that I've

12833.96 --> 12838.839999999998
come

12835.0 --> 12842.479
across balancing it out and then a

12838.84 --> 12846.239
spontaneous generation happens and I put

12842.479 --> 12849.519999999999
it down as I see it and it's pure and

12846.239 --> 12852.119999999999
it's honest and it's spontaneous and

12849.52 --> 12856.12
this is the inside that's come out of it

12852.12 --> 12859.160000000002
what I just shared with you

12856.12 --> 12861.84
yeah is the pure is the

12859.16 --> 12866.199
pureness not referencing anything it's

12861.84 --> 12869.68
just pureness pure logic yeah and pure

12866.199 --> 12872.92
logic is God because God is truth and

12869.68 --> 12875.6
Satan is lies and that's a rule of fist

12872.92 --> 12877.04
that I will hold on to until I die

12875.6 --> 12880.08
because it

12877.04 --> 12883.439
works and it works

12880.08 --> 12886.8
always it's like an esoteric rule of

12883.439 --> 12890.279
fist it works always like it doesn't

12886.8 --> 12893.92
matter how you think or what you accept

12890.279 --> 12897.52
or what you reject it always

12893.92 --> 12900.84
works it is deistic it works with

12897.52 --> 12903.560000000001
everything everything every religion

12900.84 --> 12909.04
every piece of reasoning every

12903.56 --> 12909.039999999999
logic God is truth Satan is lies

12917.0 --> 12923.239
anyway ego and yis yep well that

12921.279 --> 12926.960000000001
summarizes

12923.239 --> 12931.08
gnosticism it's ridiculous like I've

12926.96 --> 12933.239
felt the power of a god like I felt like

12931.08 --> 12935.479
I was a god when I was younger I'm not

12933.239 --> 12937.399
exaggerating like I literally felt that

12935.479 --> 12939.96
through my inside and through the the

12937.399 --> 12944.64
subtleties my subtle sensories I felt

12939.96 --> 12949.519999999999
like I am like like a wizard Hercules or

12944.64 --> 12954.319
something like I am God a God but I

12949.52 --> 12957.0
never once never once was [ __ ]

12954.319 --> 12962.6
enough because you have to be [ __ ]

12957.0 --> 12966.68
to actually believe I am God I am the

12962.6 --> 12971.16
one that created it all like you have to

12966.68 --> 12974.279
genuinely be [ __ ] to believe that to

12971.16 --> 12978.399
have that come out of you and then think

12974.279 --> 12982.800000000001
that that's real you must be

12978.399 --> 12982.8
[ __ ] if you actually believe

12995.479 --> 13000.16
that Walter Russell thinks he's God like

12998.199 --> 13002.439
tobay yeah well Walter Russell is a

13000.16 --> 13006.16
little nutty yeah he's had some

13002.439 --> 13008.0
interesting things interesting patterns

13006.16 --> 13011.279
but it doesn't seem to make a lot of

13008.0 --> 13014.68
sense and there is like a weird

13011.279 --> 13018.880000000001
megalomania to it to Walter Russell's

13014.68 --> 13022.199
work it does actually lead to a dead end

13018.88 --> 13025.399
he has good pattern inside but it leads

13022.199 --> 13029.04
to a dead end yeah typical

13025.399 --> 13034.119999999999
Gnostic gnostics disease oh look at

13029.04 --> 13037.0
these great patterns oh they don't fit

13034.12 --> 13039.6
in the hole not really they're

13037.0 --> 13042.12
interesting self-contained little

13039.6 --> 13045.6
patterns it's really interesting oh it

13042.12 --> 13050.76
looks so balanced oh it's so so whole

13045.6 --> 13053.52
but it doesn't actually fit in the rest

13050.76 --> 13053.52
of all

13054.199 --> 13061.199
reality cuz it's not real it's

13058.239 --> 13065.16
broken it's a self-contained pattern

13061.199 --> 13066.239000000001
system that's that works yeah my rule of

13065.16 --> 13069.84
fist

13066.239 --> 13073.8
God is truth Satan is lies

13069.84 --> 13078.56
yeah that's not contained in its own

13073.8 --> 13082.08
little world no that actually applies to

13078.56 --> 13086.519999999999
all things if you think about it it

13082.08 --> 13089.039999999999
actually does apply to All Things

13086.52 --> 13091.199
forever it's a way of looking at it and

13089.04 --> 13095.720000000001
it really works and it's actually

13091.199 --> 13099.640000000001
durable and useful a good guide

13095.72 --> 13103.479
a good way to keep things clear in your

13099.64 --> 13105.56
mind to not convolute

13103.479 --> 13109.039999999999
things

13105.56 --> 13109.039999999999
yeah that's the

13114.439 --> 13118.92
difference what are you talking about

13117.04 --> 13122.92
would work rule of fist is just a

13118.92 --> 13122.92
general saying right

13125.92 --> 13132.08
it's like something that always

13129.12 --> 13134.319000000001
works a rule that should always be held

13132.08 --> 13134.319
on

13134.439 --> 13139.800000000001
to because it always works I don't know

13138.0 --> 13142.16
what the hell you're talking about with

13139.8 --> 13143.16
tough on wives like that makes no sense

13142.16 --> 13145.6
to

13143.16 --> 13148.08
me rule of

13145.6 --> 13150.479000000001
thumb okay is it a rule of thumb is a

13148.08 --> 13153.88
rule of fist not a no not the proper way

13150.479 --> 13153.88
to say it

13156.359 --> 13160.16
I thought you could say

13175.12 --> 13182.08
both H that's weird if that slipped

13179.16 --> 13183.84
in I may have just like colloquially

13182.08 --> 13186.6
altered it

13183.84 --> 13188.960000000001
then okay I guess I I'll just try to

13186.6 --> 13192.640000000001
keep saying rule of thumb it's just it

13188.96 --> 13192.64
it kind of turned into the rule of

13196.8 --> 13201.88
fist I don't see how that has to do with

13199.96 --> 13205.239
any physical violence though I don't

13201.88 --> 13205.239
think that's particularly

13207.0 --> 13211.92
funny Woodwork and gy Bear

13224.8 --> 13230.039999999999
F oh okay so it's German it's German in

13228.04 --> 13233.399000000001
origin to say R of

13230.04 --> 13236.6
fist okay that makes sense then because

13233.399 --> 13239.278999999999
in Dutch it is it is like that it is a

13236.6 --> 13239.279
thing to say

13240.72 --> 13246.76
that

13243.04 --> 13249.319000000001
so it's is it not the same in English

13246.76 --> 13253.199
though is it not a proper saying in

13249.319 --> 13258.479
English is it really like a Germanic

13253.199 --> 13258.479000000001
thing that I just autot translated in my

13266.68 --> 13271.92
head whoa damn can't believe that the

13269.56 --> 13274.68
show like I completely forgot about the

13271.92 --> 13276.479
time now we're talking about gnosticism

13274.68 --> 13278.84
and it's actually

13276.479 --> 13281.96
interesting I'm I'm going to go for the

13278.84 --> 13281.960000000001
4our show I

13286.04 --> 13292.640000000001
guess you only use the rule of thumb

13289.159 --> 13292.64
okay fine wood working gy

13299.56 --> 13305.399
bear I confused it by the of this right

13303.84 --> 13307.359
okay

13305.399 --> 13309.64
okay well I guess I learned something

13307.359 --> 13309.640000000001
new

13318.12 --> 13324.800000000001
then I guess that rule of fist is kind

13321.08 --> 13327.52
of a A German German

13324.8 --> 13332.159
ification of

13327.52 --> 13332.159
English or again it's just a literal

13333.159 --> 13337.479
translation but it's not a prop for

13335.319 --> 13339.319
saying in English Okay so now I know

13337.479 --> 13342.159
thank thanks for

13339.319 --> 13345.278999999999
that I am however going to round out the

13342.159 --> 13345.279
show because I am

13345.96 --> 13351.278999999999
hungry but yeah it's been great hope you

13348.88 --> 13354.198999999999
all enjoyed it too it's been interesting

13351.279 --> 13354.199
wide variety of

13354.8 --> 13363.438999999998
topics from climate change nonsense to

13359.04 --> 13363.439
like Recycling and gnosticism

13366.479 --> 13368.96
that's been

13392.84 --> 13397.8
interesting oh yeah would work I've

13395.319 --> 13397.8
heard of

13399.319 --> 13404.96
that I don't know though like I did not

13402.56 --> 13407.92
is that always what a rule of thumb is

13404.96 --> 13409.278999999999
about it's just about beating people

13407.92 --> 13412.08
with the

13409.279 --> 13415.08
stick cuz that's not how I meant that at

13412.08 --> 13415.08
all

13430.479 --> 13435.599999999999
I just see a rule of thumb as just

13433.64 --> 13436.68
that's just something you do that's just

13435.6 --> 13439.720000000001
the

13436.68 --> 13442.359
rules not necessarily a rule that is

13439.72 --> 13444.88
enforced by beating if you this if you

13442.359 --> 13448.04
don't do it that's not how I meant that

13444.88 --> 13448.039999999999
at all

13464.399 --> 13470.278999999999
it means the same thing

13467.72 --> 13473.599999999999
nowadays okay

13470.279 --> 13475.84
weird so yeah thanks for making it a lot

13473.6 --> 13478.12
more confusing for me there Woodwork and

13475.84 --> 13478.12
guny

13480.56 --> 13485.278999999999
Bear right but I am actually rounding

today's show I mean yeah yesterday show

13518.72 --> 13525.479
kind of sucked just a bunch of

13522.08 --> 13528.12
trolls but today yeah trolls came in too

13525.479 --> 13531.198999999999
but it didn't stick and we ended up with

13528.12 --> 13535.159000000001
