152.519 --> 160.519
Wednesday and uh was it's been just a

156.64 --> 160.51899999999998
gigantic hassle

161.36 --> 168.44000000000003
gigantic I've been just completely

164.92 --> 168.44
stressing out I've been

168.519 --> 174.68
sick and had serious internet withdrawal

171.879 --> 178.56
because I have been incapable of doing

174.68 --> 180.31900000000002
like anything at all

178.56 --> 182.159
[Music]

180.319 --> 185.599
and

182.159 --> 187.39999999999998
uh I'm afraid that this is going to last

185.599 --> 192.35999999999999
for like another two

187.4 --> 194.72
[Music]

192.36 --> 199.68
weeks cuz it seems like there's some

194.72 --> 199.68
kind of like wire break in the entire

201.159 --> 208.319
system and uh yeah I'm going to have

205.92 --> 211.23899999999998
some limited internet

208.319 --> 214.28
through this white wireless system but

211.239 --> 216.72
again it has limited

214.28 --> 219.48
data so I'm afraid I'm not going to be

216.72 --> 222.08
able to stream for quite a while and

219.48 --> 223.19
lucky to be able to have access to my

222.08 --> 226.389
email and all

223.19 --> 226.389
[Music]

226.519 --> 236.12
that right and to Skype but there's not

230.959 --> 236.12
going to be a lot of streaming for a

238.319 --> 244.48
while I get chance go I've already done

241.68 --> 247.72
that kind of thing thanks B I design

244.48 --> 251.79899999999998
I've I've been doing anything I can it's

247.72 --> 251.799
just the overall situation is

259.72 --> 264.88000000000005
terrible it's

261.639 --> 267.84000000000003
like every step of the way that I tried

264.88 --> 270.52
to get the internet back is just

267.84 --> 274.9
something goes wrong like every time

270.52 --> 278.65
it's been just a horrifying disaster

274.9 --> 278.65
[Music]

283.96 --> 289.479
week enough effectively been internet

286.8 --> 292.12
fasting which I don't know there's

289.479 --> 292.12
something to

293.68 --> 300.72
it I've been just so stuck to the

297.12 --> 303.24
internet and used to it that

300.72 --> 308.32000000000005
just not doing that and only having

303.24 --> 308.32
access to games that aren't online

309.08 --> 315.44
and and movies from my database which is

312.36 --> 317.28000000000003
like great that I have a video database

315.44 --> 322.0
a lot of stuff to

317.28 --> 322.0
watch that that been like a

322.52 --> 330.84
real yeah real Comfort I can just watch

326.56 --> 335.12
some cool movies that I downloaded

330.84 --> 339.0
but overall i' I've been very

335.12 --> 339.0
isolated very very

346.08 --> 352.84
isolated and I really miss you guys I

349.4 --> 357.44
really miss doing what I

352.84 --> 357.44
do just watching the things that I

358.16 --> 363.759
watch and just having my Daily Show to

361.28 --> 363.75899999999996
look out

365.68 --> 370.199
to and I'm missing this the support too

369.24 --> 374.199
I

370.199 --> 378.91900000000004
mean like I'm just screwed

374.199 --> 378.91900000000004
now I don't know how to say it any other

383.82 --> 386.959
[Music]

388.56 --> 392.56
way for

423.84 --> 426.84
right

427.319 --> 435.40000000000003
anyway sorry I'm a bit of

431.08 --> 435.4
a tough mode

454.879 --> 461.40000000000003
of course the trolls will have to find

456.52 --> 461.4
me again it's always going to be like

466.24 --> 472.24
that right but I'm going to keep my

468.72 --> 472.24
stream today as short as I

473.96 --> 479.52
can I just wanted to cross connect with

477.28 --> 480.599
you guys and just let you know like I'm

479.52 --> 485.71999999999997
still

480.599 --> 485.71999999999997
here I can really use the support

488.56 --> 508.95
[Music]

536.08 --> 540.72
right so yeah that's I guess that's kind

539.04 --> 543.12
of it

540.72 --> 546.2
it's going to be internet fasting

543.12 --> 549.16
mostly I am not going to be like in a

546.2 --> 551.36
state really where I'm going to just

549.16 --> 554.1999999999999
comfortably be able to do a

551.36 --> 556.76
show especially for hours and hours

554.2 --> 558.839
because that'll just suck all the data

556.76 --> 562.04
out of the package that we have here as

558.839 --> 564.5600000000001
an emergency

562.04 --> 568.68
internet so I'm very sorry there's

564.56 --> 568.68
nothing I can do about it

582.04 --> 585.12
yes I did put out a

589.399 --> 595.8
tweet yeah Gary F but I mean nobody's

592.399 --> 598.92

bad it's it's been bad for a

915.19 --> 919.0
[Music]

916.48 --> 923.639
while I just wish there was some way

919.0 --> 923.639
that I could get in unlimited internet

924.56 --> 929.56
somehow and that I wouldn't have to be

927.24 --> 932.759
dependent

929.56 --> 936.56
like on landline of this house I wish

932.759 --> 936.5600000000001
there was some kind of way to do

937.68 --> 944.179
that and I don't know

939.64 --> 944.179
[Music]

946.88 --> 952.92

949.399 --> 955.8
just happen just like that and

952.92 --> 958.8
it's and then I get cut off for almost a

955.8 --> 958.8

I mean I hope I could just get back to

1022.639 --> 1026.88
the

1023.48 --> 1029.6
show at the start of May because that's

1026.88 --> 1032.64
how long it's going to take

1029.6 --> 1034.9189999999999
man I can't believe it's going to be

1307.44 --> 1313.3600000000001
it they're only going to be able to like

1309.64 --> 1318.64
trace it down and fix it first of

1404.039 --> 1410.36
yes Dark Soul Thing it feels like it

1407.36 --> 1413.12
guys I feel like I'm being tested really

1410.36 --> 1414.6789999999999
severely I'm even like watching movies

1413.12 --> 1417.84
and [ __ ]

1414.679 --> 1421.159
and like everything is testing me I've

1417.84 --> 1421.1589999999999
been watching like Star

1422.64 --> 1429.64
Wars and it's testing

1425.32 --> 1432.84
me like everything is just testing

1429.64 --> 1434.24
me 22 years without internet once yeah

1432.84 --> 1437.039
me

1434.24 --> 1439.2
too I don't know how the hell I managed

1437.039 --> 1442.64
that back then how everything has

1439.2 --> 1445.919
changed it it is kind of scary to just

1442.64 --> 1448.7990000000002
know like how incredibly dependent I've

1445.919 --> 1452.919
become on the

1448.799 --> 1454.48
internet socially it's it's quite severe

1452.919 --> 1459.5200000000002
I have to admit

1454.48 --> 1462.799
it but there's absolutely nothing I can

1459.52 --> 1465.559
see that can be changed about it it's

1462.799 --> 1465.559
just what it

1465.84 --> 1471.32
is Dam it

1468.919 --> 1473.919
oh yeah I haven't shown the

1471.32 --> 1475.559
weather just look at all the blossom it

1473.919 --> 1478.96
all just blew

1475.559 --> 1478.96
away such a

1482.79 --> 1487.8799999999999
[Music]

1484.039 --> 1490.559
shame like the day it got cut off was

1487.88 --> 1492.64
the most beautiful

1490.559 --> 1495.52
day like this

1492.64 --> 1499.88
season and then you guys got caught up

1495.52 --> 1499.8799999999999
it it's just it was horrifying

1499.96 --> 1504.88
do they have free internet n but no not

1505.44 --> 1511.76
really like I I can't just bring my

1509.12 --> 1515.36
desktop computer everywhere else to do

1511.76 --> 1515.36
something with it it doesn't

1524.679 --> 1529.3200000000002
work speak to your neighbors maybe we'll

1526.919 --> 1531.6000000000001
give you piggy back I've been trying

1529.32 --> 1535.8799999999999
that borders boy and it just doesn't

1531.6 --> 1539.6789999999999
[ __ ] work I I'm so sick of it I got

1535.88 --> 1542.5200000000002
this this Wi-Fi card and it just won't

1539.679 --> 1542.52
connect with

1544.559 --> 1550.24
anything and I don't understand why and

1547.44 --> 1554.0
it's like I'm just I'm my nerves are

1550.24 --> 1556.48
just like [ __ ] broken man like I I

1554.0 --> 1558.919
have to do all these things to just try

1556.48 --> 1562.559
to fun get to functioning normally and

1558.919 --> 1565.6000000000001
I'm just getting too feeble to do it

1562.559 --> 1568.0
it's just I I can't deal with nothing

1565.6 --> 1571.039
[ __ ] working like no matter what I do

1568.0 --> 1574.08
for [ __ ] a week straight everything I

1571.039 --> 1576.2
try nothing works and I'm really doing

1574.08 --> 1579.6399999999999
it the right way and I'm making effort

1576.2 --> 1582.559
and it's like nothing [ __ ] works it's

1579.64 --> 1582.5590000000002
driving me

1585.52 --> 1591.8799999999999
insane streaming and lower it's in a

1587.919 --> 1591.88
minute imum quality debatable

1592.72 --> 1599.88
D and I'm not going to stream

1596.679 --> 1604.0
longer I can't just stream longer until

1599.88 --> 1604.0
I'm I've somehow manag to

1604.279 --> 1610.12
fix fix this wi-fi interface because

1607.559 --> 1612.72
then I could go with the

1610.12 --> 1615.52
neighbors I already got their codes and

1612.72 --> 1619.159
everything it just it just refuses to

1615.52 --> 1619.1589999999999
log in on it

1623.76 --> 1629.1589999999999
driver issues yeah well that's my that's

1626.76 --> 1631.44
my problem debatable D I can't figure it

1629.159 --> 1637.3600000000001
out

1631.44 --> 1637.3600000000001
dude s my yeah

1637.559 --> 1643.039
well I can't turn it down anymore I

1640.72 --> 1645.64
literally have like the

1643.039 --> 1650.12
minimum hey

1645.64 --> 1652.159
Kevlar shut the hell up Kevlar

1650.12 --> 1655.12
this is not

1652.159 --> 1657.7600000000002
funny you think I haven't tried to reset

1655.12 --> 1661.4799999999998
the [ __ ] router in a

1657.76 --> 1661.48
week Jesus

1661.96 --> 1668.799
Christ I replaced the entire modem by

1665.44 --> 1672.44
now everything dude everything you could

1668.799 --> 1675.36
possibly conceive of to be done when you

1672.44 --> 1677.44
have internet troubles I have done

1675.36 --> 1680.12
everything everything you could ever

1677.44 --> 1680.1200000000001
think of

1680.68 --> 1684.939
[Music]

1691.0 --> 1695.84
change bit rate in OBS to 2 how does

1693.64 --> 1695.8400000000001
that

1700.12 --> 1706.2399999999998
work where where debatable D where do

1703.799 --> 1706.24
you do

1707.12 --> 1711.76
that bit rate it's a bit rate is at

1712.6 --> 1717.36
2,500 I guess I could go put it to

1718.679 --> 1725.3990000000001
2,000 okay I'll do

1721.399 --> 1725.399
that hopefully it'll still

1727.76 --> 1733.96
work I just applied it thanks for the

1736.64 --> 1739.96
tip start

1738.76 --> 1743.48
satellite

1739.96 --> 1747.679
internet 50 a

1743.48 --> 1750.24
month that's not bad I guess I just 50 a

1747.679 --> 1750.24
month is a

1758.559 --> 1764.279
lot what I really need at this point is

1762.2 --> 1767.64
somebody to help me

1764.279 --> 1770.039
get my network card working that's what

1767.64 --> 1770.039
I really

1772.2 --> 1777.64
need if I get that to work then I could

1775.519 --> 1780.48
like connect up with the neighbors or or

1777.64 --> 1783.1200000000001
that kind of thing and

1780.48 --> 1785.72
then I could potentially do daily

1783.12 --> 1785.7199999999998
streams

1786.36 --> 1790.6399999999999
again that's it

1801.64 --> 1806.8400000000001
lower it to

1803.039 --> 1806.84
500 okay I'll try

1811.48 --> 1818.44
that it's going to be choppy

1814.799 --> 1818.44
though let's try

1825.32 --> 1830.519
it Wi-Fi card do I have inter internal

1828.32 --> 1830.519
it's

1847.519 --> 1856.44
internal okay how is the stream now

1851.08 --> 1856.4399999999998
because I did down the bit rate

1859.24 --> 1862.44
a lot

1898.84 --> 1903.0
are you guys still reading me

1919.44 --> 1923.0
still looking good oh okay yeah it's

1921.36 --> 1927.0
kind of fluid with me

1923.0 --> 1927.0
too right

1948.0 --> 1951.159
totally independent of

1952.799 --> 1957.399
cables does that have unlimited internet

1955.639 --> 1960.559
moon

1957.399 --> 1962.399
rover I mean I'd love to do it really

1960.559 --> 1968.1589999999999
it's just that I don't know where the

1962.399 --> 1968.1589999999999
hell I'd get the extra 50 a month from

2022.039 --> 2025.559
okay that sounds cool the Bal

2035.48 --> 2041.2
D yeah I got it TP Link Card

2044.32 --> 2051.24
thing I got this thing for my

2048.359 --> 2055.56
PC but I mean I can't get it to work it

2051.24 --> 2055.56
just refuses to connect up I don't know

2059.679 --> 2064.32
why yeah it's very frustrating

2077.52 --> 2082.7599999999998
know which verion

2080.079 --> 2085.76
is yeah it is an Archer

2082.76 --> 2085.76
T

2088.0 --> 2092.879
5e I guess it's the more expensive

2090.399 --> 2095.3199999999997
version but I just can't get it to

2092.879 --> 2099.1189999999997
freaking work it drives me

2095.32 --> 2101.6800000000003
nuts it it refuses to like I can't log

2099.119 --> 2103.7200000000003
in anything like I can't even log into

2101.68 --> 2107.359
this dongle when it's right next to it

2103.72 --> 2107.359
refuses to connect up that's

2109.839 --> 2115.56
right yeah I can try to select Wi-Fi

2112.72 --> 2119.8799999999997
networks but with every single one I've

2115.56 --> 2124.56
ever tried it just won't get

2119.88 --> 2124.56
in not even this the

2126.64 --> 2130.68
dongle for

2162.4 --> 2168.04
internet clash with

2164.52 --> 2172.4
another USB D well that is what I'm

2168.04 --> 2172.4
doing basically right now

2193.04 --> 2201.44
B revolutions I don't know debatable

2197.56 --> 2201.44
D where do I find

2209.76 --> 2214.2400000000002
that is that video

2217.88 --> 2223.56
yeah it's set it because the stream is

2220.28 --> 2223.5600000000004
active I can't change

2224.24 --> 2229.16
it it said high

2227.119 --> 2231.8
resolution there's nothing I can do

2229.16 --> 2231.7999999999997
about it right

2240.0 --> 2245.4
now right but guys like I can't keep

2243.24 --> 2247.4799999999996
this up

2245.4 --> 2250.64
forever I would really appreciate

2247.48 --> 2254.079
apprciate it if somebody could like help

2250.64 --> 2256.24
me not through the live stream which is

2254.079 --> 2259.2400000000002
like way more

2256.24 --> 2262.1189999999997
wasteful but through another

2259.24 --> 2264.359
way I don't know maybe somebody could

2262.119 --> 2268.44
even like come over here and visit me

2264.359 --> 2268.44
and help me out that would be

2272.359 --> 2278.48
fantastic plug it into another Port no

2275.16 --> 2280.48
but it it is working it's just not

2278.48 --> 2283.44
working

2280.48 --> 2285.119
properly like everything seems like it's

2283.44 --> 2287.2000000000003
working the way it should it just

2285.119 --> 2290.48
refuses to connect up for some reason

2287.2 --> 2290.48
and I can't pinpoint

2291.8 --> 2297.1600000000003
why maybe I could try to put it in

2294.68 --> 2297.16
another

2300.16 --> 2306.8799999999997
Port I don't know I don't know if that

2303.24 --> 2309.4399999999996
will help maybe that's actually worth

2306.88 --> 2309.44
trying

2315.599 --> 2320.8
but I mean it's not like there's nothing

2317.599 --> 2323.319
working like it seems to be working all

2320.8 --> 2325.92
just fine like there is wireless

2323.319 --> 2329.52
networks that are being reported in and

2325.92 --> 2332.079
all that so there's something working

2329.52 --> 2336.56
right it's just I can't connect up for

2332.079 --> 2336.5600000000004
some reason and I don't know why

2349.319 --> 2355.88
like I don't understand why but I can't

2352.2 --> 2358.56
like I got the password down from the

2355.88 --> 2363.359
dungle and Tred to connect and then it

2358.56 --> 2363.359
just doesn't admit me

2382.319 --> 2389.2
Windows Firewall how does that work I

2385.8 --> 2389.2000000000003
don't think I have a Windows

2389.48 --> 2400.05
Firewall no

2392.65 --> 2400.05
[Music]

2422.0 --> 2427.72
sometimes window security causes issues

2424.319 --> 2427.72
yeah maybe

2431.64 --> 2437.4
I just distracted me nuts dude

2472.079 --> 2478.6800000000003
hello Joe crap and shits okay

2489.96 --> 2495.4
nobody in my building handy with

2491.48 --> 2495.4
computers I don't think so not that

2516.24 --> 2520.16
handy for

2560.64 --> 2564.96
family yeah maybe I'm probably going to

2563.72 --> 2568.5589999999997
try that

2564.96 --> 2571.92
next my dad recommended like one of

2568.559 --> 2575.3590000000004
my nephews I think or cousins whatever

2571.92 --> 2575.359
you call that

2579.64 --> 2583.24
I think I'm going to try to contact him

2581.48 --> 2585.8
about it and maybe he can come and visit

2583.24 --> 2585.7999999999997
and help me

2592.28 --> 2598.559
out right but at least I can like access

2595.2 --> 2598.5589999999997
things like email again

2599.0 --> 2607.28
and and my PayPal and all that sort of

2603.04 --> 2607.2799999999997
thing that's something

2623.8 --> 2629.6800000000003
talking about which like again some

2627.119 --> 2634.8
PayPal donations would be like really

2629.68 --> 2634.7999999999997
appreciated I I'm in trouble

2641.64 --> 2646.7999999999997
I'm going to keep trying to fix

2644.119 --> 2650.04
this and then hopefully at some point I

2646.8 --> 2653.319
will have like more durable internet and

2650.04 --> 2653.319
then just start streaming

2654.079 --> 2660.319
again maybe neighbors wi access to

2657.839 --> 2660.319
specific

2661.0 --> 2666.319
machines maybe I I don't know

2670.72 --> 2674.319
anyway thanks for all the tips and

2688.8 --> 2696.8390000000004
everything what does that

2690.92 --> 2696.839
mean may be using we WPA

2699.2 --> 2705.24
yeah but borders boy I'm streaming

2701.92 --> 2708.319
through limited

2705.24 --> 2711.3999999999996
data so I can't keep this up for like

2708.319 --> 2714.72
two weeks there's no

2711.4 --> 2718.6800000000003
way well maybe I could but I mean I got

2714.72 --> 2718.68
like 100 gigaby and that's

2724.64 --> 2732.68
it very laggy

2727.48 --> 2732.68
could be I I limited the amount of

2732.8 --> 2737.88
data in

2734.68 --> 2742.04
OBS to get down the frame yeah to get

2737.88 --> 2744.559
down the amount of

2742.04 --> 2748.2799999999997
internet

2744.559 --> 2748.28
usage sorry about

2753.44 --> 2758.92
that right anyway I'm really glad to be

2756.44 --> 2758.92
back

2760.599 --> 2765.96
it's no streaming it's not about it

2762.24 --> 2765.9599999999996
being broken it's about not being

2772.839 --> 2779.319
durable get it down all right I will try

2776.319 --> 2779.319
that

2798.359 --> 2807.119
click the WPA button for you to

2802.4 --> 2807.119
connect I didn't know that

2834.04 --> 2840.72
those are some really good tips by the

2835.8 --> 2846.2400000000002
way but I can't check that right

2840.72 --> 2846.24
now but I'll I'll make a note of that

2850.7 --> 2853.75
[Music]

2860.04 --> 2862.68
how does that

2866.96 --> 2874.68
work a gig fund

2870.68 --> 2874.68
me what

2905.76 --> 2908.76
WPA

2927.64 --> 2932.48
but 30 seconds to click the Bell

2932.52 --> 2936.52
here okay

2937.839 --> 2943.56
well the dongle doesn't even have a WPA

2940.41 --> 2943.56
[Music]

2958.52 --> 2964.4
button and that's the weird thing is

2960.599 --> 2966.44
that I can't even log in onto the dongle

2964.4 --> 2968.7200000000003
unless I plug it directly into my

2966.44 --> 2968.7200000000003
computer

2992.52 --> 2997.0
computer land cable

3001.319 --> 3006.799
yeah no I don't have a land cable that's

3003.119 --> 3006.799
long that's going to be long enough for

3024.119 --> 3029.6800000000003

3025.64 --> 3029.68
right for

3036.04 --> 3039.15
[Music]

3059.599 --> 3066.079
right guys but I'm going to basically uh

3062.839 --> 3068.2
disconnect the the

3066.079 --> 3070.319
stream and then I'm going to try to

3068.2 --> 3073.24
restart it on the lower resolution and

3070.319 --> 3075.16
hopefully that'll spare me a lot of

3073.24 --> 3077.68
internet

3075.16 --> 3080.92
traffic so I think I'm going to try that

3077.68 --> 3080.9199999999996

3088.48 --> 3095.839
