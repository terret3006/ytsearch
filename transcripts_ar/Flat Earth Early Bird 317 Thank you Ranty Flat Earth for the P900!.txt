97.54 --> 105.67
course so yeah yeah I'm kind of sick ish

101.91 --> 108.64
well pretty substantially like yesterday

105.67 --> 111.909
evening it really had bad I guess all

108.64 --> 117.88
the exposure to the yeah wet weather

111.909 --> 120.93
constantly and not eating properly yeah

117.88 --> 125.02
that did usually when I get like anxious

120.93 --> 128.83
that tends to typically result in me

125.02 --> 131.759
getting sick afterward so yeah it was

128.83 --> 131.75900000000001
kind of expected

135.08 --> 142.67000000000002
so yeah let's see what's in chat all

139.32 --> 146.6

196.29 --> 202.56
conference when he hit gave it to me I

198.33 --> 206.67000000000002
kind of was a little like confused in

202.56 --> 210.75
the sense that it's not the same setup

206.67 --> 213.20899999999997
as here so I might have like verbally

210.75 --> 216.75
forgotten even to thank him with his

213.209 --> 219.9
name I just don't remember it but yeah

216.75 --> 221.82
if I did then I'm sorry it wasn't meant

219.9 --> 225.36
as some kind of insults more me like

221.82 --> 228.29999999999998
getting stage fluster okay if that is

225.36 --> 231.36
the case so I don't know what has been

228.3 --> 235.62
said and everything but yeah I am very

231.36 --> 242.55
thankful to Randi for the camera yeah go

256.549 --> 263.47999999999996
much also I have made or at least I

260.93 --> 264.889
tried a little video but it I don't know

263.48 --> 266.63
I haven't even checked it out yet I

264.889 --> 269.0
downloaded it just to my computer

266.63 --> 273.08
because there's this one spot with a

269.0 --> 276.8
bridge I thought let's just see if I can

273.08 --> 278.93
get the optical slant effect but it's a

276.8 --> 285.35
very short distance so I don't know if

278.93 --> 288.01
it'll actually work out let's see

285.35 --> 288.01000000000005
where's that thing

292.52 --> 307.039
alright it is uh I need to move that

299.27 --> 310.28
over into Skype oh hello

307.039 --> 312.639
that's not what I asked for you stupid

310.28 --> 312.63899999999995
computer

313.12 --> 323.77
all right oh damn it's very big okay I

321.289 --> 327.46
guess I have to separately present it in

323.77 --> 330.46
man the resolution on this thing is huge

327.46 --> 330.46
sheesh

347.069 --> 354.43
no no no it's pretty much useless I got

351.58 --> 359.919
it all blurry I need to keep on working

354.43 --> 362.409
on that all right so yeah the p900

359.919 --> 366.31
turned out to be pretty easy and use

362.409 --> 368.86
really like scuba dracula and another

366.31 --> 370.81
guy I heard killed the hope they have p9

368.86 --> 373.15000000000003
hundreds of scuba Dracula was hauling

370.81 --> 376.36
along his also all the time and he gave

373.15 --> 380.77
me some good tips on just and I did get

376.36 --> 385.319
some really cool photos so yeah but I

380.77 --> 388.24
don't have them all sorted yet so I have

385.319 --> 389.83000000000004
I'm gonna look through them maybe see if

388.24 --> 391.75
I can make like a little slideshow I

389.83 --> 393.12899999999996
yeah I pretty much showed the pictures

391.75 --> 395.31

393.129 --> 395.31
conference

407.669 --> 412.81

because the optical slant right that

491.28 --> 498.57
wasn't made up by Nathan okay I came up

496.169 --> 501.99
with that I figured that out I was the

498.57 --> 505.77
first to identify the effect okay that's

501.99 --> 508.56
not something that Nathan made up okay

505.77 --> 513.39
Brenda get your facts straight

571.77 --> 577.11
done with you you know being to the

574.35 --> 579.15
conference being with actual real people

577.11 --> 581.94
real flat-earthers they were super

579.15 --> 584.6
awesome I realized something I don't

581.94 --> 588.2700000000001
want to have anything to do with you

584.6 --> 590.64
disgusting people anymore you could just

588.27 --> 593.61
crawl up in a corner and die as far as

590.64 --> 595.88
I'm concerned but nothing to do with you

593.61 --> 595.88
anymore

600.89 --> 604.299
[Music]

611.829 --> 620.3589999999999
Thank You Fyodor that's very appropriate

614.659 --> 622.879

620.359 --> 623.8090000000001
two pound super chat donation I really

622.879 --> 628.969
appreciate that

623.809 --> 633.499
good for you Arlen thank you because

628.969 --> 635.739
yeah for me I did it was quite an

633.499 --> 641.119
emotional roller coaster the whole thing

635.739 --> 644.1790000000001
like very much because you know I'm so

641.119 --> 648.5590000000001
used to doing this from here always

644.179 --> 650.779
having to swim my way through all the

648.559 --> 652.429
shitty trolls just to get to some other

650.779 --> 654.619
person that's at the same time also

652.429 --> 656.3589999999999
protecting themselves from shitty trolls

654.619 --> 658.879
and it makes you kind of distrustful and

656.359 --> 664.5690000000001
now actually being among these people

658.879 --> 664.5690000000001
for real being able to kind of like

664.749 --> 669.879
nervously let down some of my guards

667.999 --> 675.229
that I never let down on the internet

669.879 --> 681.109
and show me my weaknesses and that's

675.229 --> 684.859
just yeah it made another type of bond

681.109 --> 692.529
that I that I've missed for a long long

684.859 --> 692.529
time and yeah

694.68 --> 701.91
just make me realize that it is real

697.45 --> 701.9100000000001
that these things these people are real

705.06 --> 711.91
and it's also funny because I don't know

708.64 --> 714.16
in the group everybody just starts to

711.91 --> 716.9399999999999
contrast a little more you really get to

714.16 --> 719.9499999999999

716.94 --> 722.08

let's move on

971.59 --> 979.9
yeah it was yeah I'm just really still

976.51 --> 982.15
kind of it it was weird because the

979.9 --> 984.09
whole experience really just kind of

982.15 --> 988.8299999999999
changed me as I got back it's just

984.09 --> 988.83
nothing feels the same anymore it's like

989.49 --> 993.089
it's not the same anymore

996.18 --> 1001.9399999999999
yeah and I met like two guys from the

999.79 --> 1006.5
Netherlands that were really awesome I

1001.94 --> 1009.6500000000001
think I probably catch caught the

1006.5 --> 1012.6
brightest thing from one of him like a

1009.65 --> 1016.67
guy I think he lived in Amsterdam I

1012.6 --> 1022.11
forgot his name he visits my chat -

1016.67 --> 1026.3999999999999
you'll pop by I'm sure you will but he

1022.11 --> 1032.959
got sick as well he told me why did he

1026.4 --> 1032.959
tell me in chat I don't remember him but

1033.589 --> 1040.77
yeah and I also met Eric he'll the hope

1036.39 --> 1043.97
and then guy is just amazing he is so

1040.77 --> 1046.53
cool and he lives very close by here so

1043.97 --> 1048.329
I'm really looking forward to just

1046.53 --> 1050.28
meeting up with him just having coffee

1048.329 --> 1053.28
or something having a smoke or well I

1050.28 --> 1055.76
don't think he's much of a smoker this

1053.28 --> 1058.02
is just having a coffee whatever maybe

1055.76 --> 1063.84
go out with the p900

1058.02 --> 1066.33
and do something cool maybe even yeah

1063.84 --> 1069.87
try out carefully flat smacking or

1066.33 --> 1073.05
something sure he's up for that and and

1069.87 --> 1077.28
some others as well maybe so yeah good

1073.05 --> 1081.72
stuff hey gotta kill hope yeah you're

1077.28 --> 1086.04
awesome dude and also also a special

1081.72 --> 1090.09
shout-out to scuba Dracula that guy is

1086.04 --> 1095.28
just that is just that guy's weird but

1090.09 --> 1099.3899999999999
he's so awesome it's he it was so funny

1095.28 --> 1100.71
like the first day everybody yeah there

1099.39 --> 1103.44
was already kind of an exhilarating

1100.71 --> 1104.13
atmosphere - Friday evening because yeah

1103.44 --> 1105.99
everybody

1104.13 --> 1108.1200000000001
smoking up and it was just cool and it

1105.99 --> 1110.07
was such a good atmosphere and that guy

1108.12 --> 1113.61
was just hyperactive all over the place

1110.07 --> 1116.49
and I guess that when there's like a

1113.61 --> 1118.2299999999998
camera rolling he gets extra hyperactive

1116.49 --> 1121.13
and the attention grabbing it is kind of

1118.23 --> 1125.01
like oh my god can you please stop

1121.13 --> 1129.39
just let the stop interrupting like he

1125.01 --> 1131.85
gets he transfers typical chat activity

1129.39 --> 1133.38
to actual life spoken activity and

1131.85 --> 1137.25
that's not all that handy gets a little

1133.38 --> 1138.9
interruptive but yeah as I when we went

1137.25 --> 1141.72
out Saturday evening

1138.9 --> 1147.5600000000002
I must yeah I really tagged along with

1141.72 --> 1151.29
him that guy is really awesome he is so

1147.56 --> 1155.22
strong he is so strong that guy's

1151.29 --> 1157.2
fearless he doesn't fear anything for

1155.22 --> 1161.27
real it's not an act it's not an

1157.2 --> 1161.27
escapism the guy is amazing

1161.36 --> 1171.9199999999998
and so much fun in such good spirit it's

1167.43 --> 1171.92
just special and and so were others like

1173.15 --> 1180.65
everybody had their own character in

1175.89 --> 1180.65
their own things you know and

1185.04 --> 1195.6789999999999
most stupid right well he's not stupid

he's actually kind of sharp but he is

1198.84 --> 1212.07

1203.58 --> 1218.1789999999999
heart and his why do you think tank did

1345.22 --> 1350.1100000000001
Amsterdam conference but he did good I

1347.289 --> 1353.23
think he was gonna go to a conference in

1350.11 --> 1354.9089999999999
the United States somewhere I heard him

1353.23 --> 1356.6490000000001
say that I don't know I look I you

1354.909 --> 1360.0390000000002
haven't really kept track of all that I

1356.649 --> 1366.629
haven't been on internet for three days

1360.039 --> 1366.629
either so haven't caught up

1374.52 --> 1382.8899999999999
unicorn laser eyes yeah I definitely mmm

1378.48 --> 1393.3600000000001
dead meat some ladies I met Dede and

1382.89 --> 1395.8500000000001
Karen B and Roxanne and oh yeah be here

1393.36 --> 1400.77

1400.77 --> 1407.79
there were lots of ladies there and it

1405.99 --> 1412.94
was really nice and they were all just

1407.79 --> 1416.28
very loving and it felt like family

1412.94 --> 1421.79
yeah that's right no tour then that's

1416.28 --> 1425.25
right yeah you know why because I'm sick

1421.79 --> 1427.3799999999999
physically literally sick you know I

1425.25 --> 1428.48
could technically prove it but it would

1427.38 --> 1431.5200000000002
be disgusting

1428.48 --> 1435.65
but I knew that was coming because when

1431.52 --> 1439.35
I got anxiety attacks like I did on

1435.65 --> 1441.21
Wednesday and it is prolonged like it

1439.35 --> 1445.6799999999998
takes at least three days and I can't

1441.21 --> 1448.47
get out of it I always get sick it

1445.68 --> 1450.27
always happens never had it not happened

1448.47 --> 1451.98
that's why I said look I just have to

1450.27 --> 1454.1399999999999
see how quick this stops if it's just

1451.98 --> 1456.42
gonna be one day I'm gonna be fine then

1454.14 --> 1458.3100000000002
it's no problem you know but yeah it

1456.42 --> 1463.8300000000002
kept on kind of going I managed to

1458.31 --> 1468.6499999999999
control it but it was there yeah well

1463.83 --> 1468.6499999999999
that's your freakin problem goodbye

1472.11 --> 1480.33
yeah yeah you know in a sense I am not

1476.399 --> 1482.37
that sick but if I would have gone if I

1480.33 --> 1486.059
were to kept my on pushing myself and

1482.37 --> 1488.34
then probably for the next week not be

1486.059 --> 1490.2
eating organic because the just too

1488.34 --> 1493.47
complicated when you're dealing with

1490.2 --> 1497.3700000000001
other people you know it was kind of

1493.47 --> 1499.83
what I expected I ate no or get

1497.37 --> 1502.7399999999998
non-organic like pretty much the weekend

1499.83 --> 1506.399
well except for what I brought with me a

1502.74 --> 1510.57
couple of cookies that I Friday evening

1506.399 --> 1512.25
I gradually started to eat again but

1510.57 --> 1514.769
yeah I didn't have that much with me it

1512.25 --> 1518.01
you can't find organic stuff anywhere in

1514.769 --> 1521.76
Amsterdam unless you go we into the city

1518.01 --> 1524.73
nobody was going there and I'm not I I

1521.76 --> 1527.82
couldn't afford to leave the group

1524.73 --> 1529.799
because I could not have I could not

1527.82 --> 1532.1689999999999
keep in contact with them it's really

1529.799 --> 1534.48
weird because we try to exchange phone

1532.169 --> 1537.0590000000002
numbers and I just couldn't freaking

1534.48 --> 1539.58
call them it was impossible my freaking

1537.059 --> 1545.19
phone would not allow me to call them

1539.58 --> 1548.21
numbers was so annoying like man like

1545.19 --> 1551.49
you you gotta have like a full-on

1548.21 --> 1555.8400000000001
Internet freaking computer phone now or

1551.49 --> 1557.97
you just it doesn't work anymore so yeah

1555.84 --> 1560.1
if I'm gonna do this kind of thing

1557.97 --> 1562.08
before I'm afraid I'm just gonna have to

1560.1 --> 1564.24
get one of those damn phones that have

1562.08 --> 1567.1789999999999
been trying to avoid in the last 20

1564.24 --> 1569.75
years you just can't do it anymore it's

1567.179 --> 1569.75
not doable

1578.48 --> 1583.64

1728.79 --> 1731.6599999999999
nope

1732.86 --> 1738.86
look whatever the issue is maybe you

1736.89 --> 1743.75
should just be rebooting or something

1738.86 --> 1743.75
because you should be able to comment

1762.15 --> 1764.96
all right

1774.02 --> 1780.35
I forgot to shout everybody out and got

1776.48 --> 1782.15
to preoccupy ooh oh yeah I Rikuo the

1780.35 --> 1783.9399999999998
hope by the way you have skipped that

1782.15 --> 1787.6100000000001
comment but yes

1783.94 --> 1790.25
during the flat smacking in Amsterdam

1787.61 --> 1792.4099999999999
Central Station I made a video and a

1790.25 --> 1794.39
couple of pictures I'll I'll try to get

1792.41 --> 1796.42
it together somewhere today and

1794.39 --> 1801.65
hopefully I can present that tomorrow

1796.42 --> 1803.96
but it's just I'm still sick and like

1801.65 --> 1807.5300000000002
trying to get over that as quick as

1803.96 --> 1809.3600000000001
possible but yeah

1807.53 --> 1813.44
during the flat smacking there were two

1809.36 --> 1817.6
Spanish ladies and they were awfully

1813.44 --> 1821.179
cute I think there were like early 20s

1817.6 --> 1823.6399999999999
Spanish tiny well small ladies and they

1821.179 --> 1825.95
were just like I like their style well

1823.64 --> 1827.8700000000001
that's all black black clothes and

1825.95 --> 1832.179
everything is just and they were asking

1827.87 --> 1838.28
am i God they kept on really asking

1832.179 --> 1840.89
really deep and like I even they even

1838.28 --> 1843.17
pulled forth the rectangular looping

1840.89 --> 1848.6000000000001
concept versus the closed and closed

1843.17 --> 1851.51
disc model and they weren't like no they

1848.6 --> 1852.4699999999998
actually took it to mind so these ladies

1851.51 --> 1856.61
were really smart

1852.47 --> 1859.01
I think they seemed very smart or maybe

1856.61 --> 1862.1899999999998
they're more like okay we just take it a

1859.01 --> 1865.85
giant a few and just take all the info

1862.19 --> 1867.53
we can and then let it sink and then see

1865.85 --> 1870.11
if they get it maybe there are those

1867.53 --> 1870.86
types there I've met girls before that

1870.11 --> 1874.25
work like that

1870.86 --> 1875.6599999999999
they're like mentally not very quick but

1874.25 --> 1877.52
they can take in a lot of information

1875.66 --> 1879.77
and then they take some time to process

1877.52 --> 1882.59
it so maybe they were those types I

1879.77 --> 1885.59
think they were I did not get any phone

1882.59 --> 1888.07
numbers I'm not creepy it's kind of

1885.59 --> 1888.07
weird to ask

1890.84 --> 1899.1
look guys I am not that forward with the

1897.75 --> 1902.7
ladies I don't know if you've noticed

1899.1 --> 1907.85
but I'm just I'm a kind of [ __ ] I'm

1902.7 --> 1911.3700000000001
kind of a shy guy I think probably

1907.85 --> 1915.87
people at the conference noticed that

1911.37 --> 1919.4099999999999
about me like as especially I'd like

1915.87 --> 1920.79
really I'm I can get so shy that I even

1919.41 --> 1924.45
forget my manners

1920.79 --> 1926.94
it is weird it's like things people

1924.45 --> 1931.32
would normally say like read everybody

1926.94 --> 1935.3400000000001
and and I I kind of forget that because

1931.32 --> 1936.78
I'm like almost try not to be seen my

1935.34 --> 1940.26
instinct makes me do that

1936.78 --> 1943.29
it's like oops sorry I didn't mean to be

1940.26 --> 1945.96
impolite by not saying hello or what but

1943.29 --> 1948.12
I forget it it's really stupid but I'm

1945.96 --> 1950.49
trying to work on it if I have more

1948.12 --> 1954.3
energy if I'm not like having these

1950.49 --> 1956.82
anxiety issues then I am usually a

1954.3 --> 1960.54
little bit more forward and I can get it

1956.82 --> 1963.8999999999999
rolling better but yeah I may have been

1960.54 --> 1967.02
a little silence sometimes is sort of

1963.9 --> 1971.0400000000002
awkwardly so so I apologize if seem kind

1967.02 --> 1974.33
of off but yeah not it wasn't meant that

1971.04 --> 1977.309
way I really liked everyone I was really

1974.33 --> 1980.4289999999999
like a little overwhelmed in a positive

1977.309 --> 1984.54
way just by everyone and was so awesome

1980.429 --> 1988.97
and like everyone they were all awesome

1984.54 --> 1993.03
and especially I don't know Jaron he's a

1988.97 --> 1996.54
he's kind of a compared to me is kind of

1993.03 --> 1999.09
a big guy and like he is impressive I

1996.54 --> 2002.059
think he's just really impressive and I

1999.09 --> 2005.4499999999998
don't know maybe thought I was kind of

2002.059 --> 2007.3999999999999
weird because I would like get a little

2005.45 --> 2011.99
nervous in his presence you know he's

2007.4 --> 2015.2800000000002
really and he has some serious why is it

2011.99 --> 2019.39
charisma or just a presence to it

2015.28 --> 2022.75
no he's not fat look he's not skinny

2019.39 --> 2024.97
like me but he's not like fat I don't

2022.75 --> 2031.17
think so no I wasn't talking about that

2024.97 --> 2035.02
I was talking about just who that guy is

2031.17 --> 2046.27
what he wants what he does just had a

2035.02 --> 2048.61
real presence to him so also I don't

2046.27 --> 2052.0
know I it was kind of weird though

2048.61 --> 2054.879
because he had the whole globe tour bus

2052.0 --> 2061.06
thing it was a like a non-stop issue in

2054.879 --> 2063.3399999999997
the sense that yeah like I really

2061.06 --> 2067.96
noticed quickly like yeah this is not

2063.34 --> 2071.7400000000002
gonna work and Roxanne and Jason they

2067.96 --> 2075.1
were just they were really nice to me

2071.74 --> 2076.9599999999996
and I totally appreciate like they got

2075.1 --> 2083.5299999999997
it they understood what was happening

2076.96 --> 2085.48
with me and yeah look the whole

2083.53 --> 2088.51
situation is pretty much mixed because

2085.48 --> 2090.22
in one on one hand I'm like it would be

2088.51 --> 2092.5600000000004
awesome to do something like that but I

2090.22 --> 2096.9089999999997
just can't physically handle it I knew

2092.56 --> 2100.15
that as as it happened but and but I

2096.909 --> 2102.34
would have like um yeah it's mixed it's

2100.15 --> 2105.9900000000002
split and that's also causing part of

2102.34 --> 2110.29
the stress as it were and they got that

2105.99 --> 2112.5699999999997
but they were just awesome and yeah I

2110.29 --> 2116.68
have hung out around in the boss and the

2112.57 --> 2118.71
boss was very cool it was really cozy

2116.68 --> 2118.71
and

2125.54 --> 2133.609
what the hell are you talking about

2127.01 --> 2136.46
Copernicus thinker really yeah

2133.609 --> 2139.609
Jarek Mateus I think they did really

2136.46 --> 2141.7400000000002
care about me and I I am honored that

2139.609 --> 2144.41
they did you know because I sometimes

2141.74 --> 2147.1699999999996
think like really me this guy on freakin

2144.41 --> 2148.7599999999998
social welfare zoo is stupid emotional

2147.17 --> 2154.19
issues and half of the time it just

2148.76 --> 2156.4100000000003
talks about himself you know that's to

2154.19 --> 2159.4700000000003
be fair from a subject from an objective

2156.41 --> 2161.96
perspective that doesn't seem super

2159.47 --> 2164.5099999999998
appealing to me personally but maybe

2161.96 --> 2167.51
that is because I just don't see certain

2164.51 --> 2172.4
elements of me that do make it more

2167.51 --> 2175.7200000000003
interesting but I just felt really

2172.4 --> 2175.7200000000003
appreciated by everybody

2179.83 --> 2190.08
mark work taylor right yeah I did return

2185.5 --> 2194.62

2190.08 --> 2194.89

2194.62 --> 2197.5299999999997

demanded his money back and I gave it

2212.68 --> 2217.89
back so yeah if anybody else wants their

2216.01 --> 2223.42
money back I'll give it back to you and

2217.89 --> 2227.02
by the way for if you care I spent

2223.42 --> 2232.54
pretty much 70 euros in the whole

2227.02 --> 2237.22
weekend and zero of that 70 euros was

2232.54 --> 2239.62
spent on cannabis okay zero I had the

2237.22 --> 2242.08
the biggest thing I basically bought it

2239.62 --> 2244.75
was a little food here and there it's

2242.08 --> 2247.84
just extremely expensive extremely a lot

2244.75 --> 2251.47
of travel costs like especially through

2247.84 --> 2256.48
the Metro and all that and I had three

2251.47 --> 2260.56
beers yeah that's it that's all I got

2256.48 --> 2262.69
from that and it was still awesome and I

2260.56 --> 2264.88
kind of survived it because the other

2262.69 --> 2267.55
food was really expensive but the

2264.88 --> 2268.87
quality was not that great but I don't

2267.55 --> 2271.75
know I guess that the really good

2268.87 --> 2274.7999999999997
atmosphere kind of prevent it from

2271.75 --> 2274.8
hitting bad

2279.46 --> 2287.2
but yeah afterward now I am sick and

2283.78 --> 2289.15
that was expected you know it could have

2287.2 --> 2292.0
even been worse but I guess that the

2289.15 --> 2294.9100000000003
whole experience with with everybody and

2292.0 --> 2296.89
they were so nice and cool and I felt

2294.91 --> 2298.66
comfortable and just met such great

2296.89 --> 2302.71
people that I didn't know before and

2298.66 --> 2306.3689999999997
just awesome that that really kind of

2302.71 --> 2307.829
helped and yeah prevented it from

2306.369 --> 2310.9
getting worse

2307.829 --> 2313.44
mm-hmm but I would have become sick no

2310.9 --> 2313.44
matter what

2314.49 --> 2324.9599999999996
so yeah Joe Koufax well for those that

2322.599 --> 2327.55
don't want their money back

2324.96 --> 2331.589
yeah that is kind of what I wanted to do

2327.55 --> 2334.15
with it I wanted to get a tripod and

2331.589 --> 2336.25
maybe a lens cap because yeah that

2334.15 --> 2338.349
didn't come with it like it literally

2336.25 --> 2340.809
just came like this and I have a

2338.349 --> 2344.7400000000002
connection wire but I didn't get a lens

2340.809 --> 2348.0
cap and would be kind of handy because

2344.74 --> 2349.6899999999996
otherwise yeah scratches will get on it

2348.0 --> 2354.52
that would suck

2349.69 --> 2358.839
I would totally ruin the camera so right

2354.52 --> 2361.15
and mmm and Reese you know only Schiphol

2358.839 --> 2363.88
can see already pretty much get said

2361.15 --> 2366.94
that he yeah that that is all fine with

2363.88 --> 2370.77
him he had was by far the biggest

2366.94 --> 2370.77
donator so

2373.31 --> 2385.7
yeah anybody else that brand em gave me

2379.34 --> 2387.65
some I don't think he wanted it back the

2385.7 --> 2397.46
other guy doesn't want me to name his

2387.65 --> 2401.87
name I think and Julie L Pavan yeah just

2397.46 --> 2404.0
let me know and and I'll send you your

2401.87 --> 2407.3599999999997

2404.0 --> 2410.72

2407.36 --> 2414.1400000000003
on that tour yeah I died I did

2410.72 --> 2418.25
disappoint I get it and it's okay if you

2414.14 --> 2422.8599999999997
want your money back but hey if you

2418.25 --> 2427.19
think it it was still money well spent

2422.86 --> 2430.9100000000003
then I can definitely use it to get ya

2427.19 --> 2432.71
get get the camera thing rolling because

2430.91 --> 2437.39
I love this thing it's an awesome

2432.71 --> 2439.67

sweetheart

2455.259 --> 2462.949
set up an Amazon wishlist right well I'm

2460.64 --> 2464.66
gonna have to before I get to do this

2462.949 --> 2467.569
I'm gonna have to kind of like do a

2464.66 --> 2469.3999999999996
little really looked for buying things

2467.569 --> 2471.259
you know I don't really like the

2469.4 --> 2472.9100000000003
internet that much when it comes to

2471.259 --> 2475.88
trying to buy things because there's

2472.91 --> 2477.589
just so much I've never been well I

2475.88 --> 2478.969
don't buy a lot of things because I

2477.589 --> 2483.439
don't have a lot of money so I've never

2478.969 --> 2486.799
really gotten good with it but I'm gonna

2483.439 --> 2488.66
look into it and then see if I already

2486.799 --> 2490.759
got enough money to get everything I

2488.66 --> 2492.6789999999996
need I don't know I really do want a

2490.759 --> 2497.869
quality tripod that's not just gonna

2492.679 --> 2500.2690000000002
break after a few after a few uses and

2497.869 --> 2502.1890000000003
if I have enough well then it's just

2500.269 --> 2505.3689999999997
settle and I'll get it and then I'll

2502.189 --> 2508.0989999999997
probably close down my GoFundMe and if

2505.369 --> 2513.4990000000003
not then I'll just try to modify my

2508.099 --> 2515.4190000000003
GoFundMe to to change that but yeah

2513.499 --> 2517.189
basically I don't really need to go fund

2515.419 --> 2522.739
me anymore since I now get got that

2517.189 --> 2526.6299999999997

2555.849 --> 2568.13
