158.24 --> 169.64000000000001
granddad yes hmm all right I'll give it

164.98 --> 172.34
no how does he do it he's fine you know

169.64 --> 175.67
he had up about like seven years ago he

172.34 --> 179.54
had a stroke so like since then he's

175.67 --> 183.01999999999998
been you know like not his yep regular

179.54 --> 184.48999999999998
self and everything he's so like I out

183.02 --> 187.13000000000002
so he has to be looked after and

184.49 --> 189.83
everything he has on dementia and all

187.13 --> 192.459
that so well I don't have to look after

189.83 --> 194.63000000000002
and then make sure he's not completely

192.459 --> 196.489
not completely out of it but there's

194.63 --> 199.34
certain things that he needs you know

196.489 --> 204.11
out with you know that so I help him out

199.34 --> 205.85
with that but other than that like you

204.11 --> 210.769
know everything is other things up to

205.85 --> 214.82
par alright was that yeah yes

210.769 --> 217.58
tough situation when that happens it's

214.82 --> 219.739
very brave you and yeah it's actually

217.58 --> 221.48000000000002
common decency but these days it's

219.739 --> 224.78
almost like brave that you are actually

221.48 --> 226.36999999999998
taking care of your grandpa but and then

224.78 --> 229.82
again you're a nurse of course so it's

226.37 --> 231.59
right down your alley right yeah yeah

229.82 --> 235.94
I'm going in that barracks yeah this is

231.59 --> 237.56
oh yeah right you're still in there yeah

235.94 --> 241.37
I'm still on the program I'm not an

237.56 --> 243.019
official nurse yet so well but that's

241.37 --> 244.55
the best part of the reason why I wanted

243.019 --> 246.23000000000002
to go towards nursing because I've been

244.55 --> 248.18
because I've been taking care of him

246.23 --> 251.209
since I was like 15 16

248.18 --> 254.56
of course not on my own like it's like

251.209 --> 254.56
with my family but everybody

254.59 --> 260.18
that's good to hear that you you have

257.12 --> 261.41
such a tight family oh yeah what

260.18 --> 264.01
everybody else taking care of one

261.41 --> 267.77000000000004
another that's really good good to hear

264.01 --> 272.0
no no this is how we this is how we grow

267.77 --> 276.04999999999995
pretty much yeah yeah I know it's how it

272.0 --> 279.56
used to be but these days it's just you

276.05 --> 283.03000000000003
don't really know family attitudes

279.56 --> 285.74
change and yeah my family pretty much

283.03 --> 288.04999999999995
exploded in all directions and we're

285.74 --> 289.01
still having trouble kind of like trying

288.05 --> 292.76
to figure what out

289.01 --> 298.90999999999997
each other ass like is it okay to

292.76 --> 300.68
contact yeah I understand I know someone

298.91 --> 305.5
else who has that let's the motivation

300.68 --> 307.73
like that so that can definitely be

305.5 --> 309.41
that's you know like that and like that

307.73 --> 311.39000000000004
would be more the fact that that's more

309.41 --> 314.51000000000005
considered like a normal situation

311.39 --> 317.27
nowadays is yeah is it lie as opposed to

314.51 --> 319.669
having a close-knit type situation with

317.27 --> 320.39
your family is weird this is just like

319.669 --> 324.169
it's backwards

320.39 --> 327.40999999999997
it's from romantic you know and it's

324.169 --> 330.85999999999996
very dangerous on the long run know if

327.41 --> 336.13000000000005
it gets worse then you start to get like

330.86 --> 338.93
maniacal egocentric cultures exactly and

336.13 --> 343.61
everybody starts to turn to criminality

338.93 --> 345.65000000000003
basically that's what happens that's no

343.61 --> 348.47
but other like there's not enough

345.65 --> 350.98999999999995
emphasis to put on like they're not in

348.47 --> 352.97
that system there's more emphasis put on

350.99 --> 355.55
like the immediate family structure as

352.97 --> 359.12
opposed to having like that extended

355.55 --> 361.37
family structure this is like II like

359.12 --> 363.14
the whole um it takes a military the

361.37 --> 365.57
child when you have a lot of family

363.14 --> 367.669
members that grow up around each other

365.57 --> 369.53
when there's like that you always you

367.669 --> 370.94
know that you have blood you can depend

369.53 --> 375.04999999999995
on yeah exactly

370.94 --> 376.64
they're proposed so that just being like

375.05 --> 380.72
your parents like yes you want boy

376.64 --> 383.599
caretaker one caretaker or two yeah that

380.72 --> 386.63000000000005
that's not always normal but it's not

383.599 --> 387.46999999999997
even you had the whole idea of an entire

386.63 --> 393.02
families

387.47 --> 395.56
sure like nobody really even talks about

393.02 --> 395.56
that anymore

396.04 --> 400.04
yeah and this way it's something that's

398.27 --> 403.7
definitely fine so so that's definitely

400.04 --> 405.32
needed now it's like to have like you

403.7 --> 408.17
need your aunts you need your uncle's

405.32 --> 409.79
needs our cousins you know like you need

408.17 --> 411.65000000000003
to have that like someone you can just

409.79 --> 414.92
be like hey you come help me with this

411.65 --> 416.35999999999996
like you're supposed to having you know

414.92 --> 418.22
you can have friends and everything like

416.36 --> 420.83000000000004
that you can have neighbors that they

418.22 --> 422.33000000000004
also have their own family shows and

420.83 --> 425.0
their own family issues own that someone

422.33 --> 426.89
that's in your family it's a bit closer

425.0 --> 427.76
cuz it's like they're they're going

426.89 --> 429.53
through the same thing you're going

427.76 --> 433.28
through so they understand more and

429.53 --> 434.84
they're your blue you know like and even

433.28 --> 437.23999999999995
like you know it's not necessarily

434.84 --> 441.77
perfect but it's to be a small security

437.24 --> 443.39
bear right so that's what I'm really

441.77 --> 446.15
thankful to have that structure with my

443.39 --> 447.86
family and even though it's so light

446.15 --> 450.32
it's definitely never been perfect but

447.86 --> 453.91900000000004
it's been something I know I can lean on

450.32 --> 456.61
that's it when times get difficult well

453.919 --> 459.53
the family structures are rarely perfect

456.61 --> 461.33000000000004
it's like where's a joke to say that it

459.53 --> 463.30999999999995
could be perfect it's not it's never

461.33 --> 464.69
perfect it's always upsides and

463.31 --> 466.81
downsides you're always going to be

464.69 --> 471.13
subjected to some kind of family issue

466.81 --> 475.22
but yeah when the [ __ ] hits the fan

471.13 --> 479.33
people align and like certainly it all

475.22 --> 483.11
forms up if it's a well if every little

479.33 --> 484.78999999999996
some may some like maybe escapists as it

483.11 --> 488.84000000000003
were and they will be running off when

484.79 --> 490.55
that happens all depends but very long

488.84 --> 493.4
as there's plenty of people in there

490.55 --> 495.77000000000004
that are part of really that enforcing

493.4 --> 498.32
structure then when trouble goes down

495.77 --> 500.69
you can rely on some family structure

498.32 --> 502.82
much more than friends and especially

500.69 --> 507.29
government which usually can be the

502.82 --> 509.93
cause of it yeah you don't really even

507.29 --> 511.49
see that like a family structure like

509.93 --> 514.01
that per se like that new media that's

511.49 --> 515.78
another thing is that like you have you

514.01 --> 519.02
have family shows and everything but

515.78 --> 520.8
it's good like oh and then they like

519.02 --> 522.419
they show the

520.8 --> 524.3389999999999
this functional family aspect that that

522.419 --> 527.459
sparkles like that's a lot of times but

524.339 --> 529.0200000000001
a lot of families have dysfunction but

527.459 --> 531.3299999999999
then they out like I like those shows

529.02 --> 532.5889999999999
that show the different family units

531.33 --> 533.5500000000001
like you might have the two parents

532.589 --> 536.58
which you might also have the

533.55 --> 538.74
grandparents there you might have like

536.58 --> 541.1700000000001
an aunt or uncle there also with the

538.74 --> 544.2
family and they have their issues that

541.17 --> 546.27
in there like then they're able to work

544.2 --> 547.9200000000001
them out in some kind of way and then

546.27 --> 551.67
like they show that more realistic

547.92 --> 554.52
aspect of it you know it's not but

551.67 --> 555.959
nowadays it's like you don't really sit

554.52 --> 558.5699999999999
like you don't really see that too much

555.959 --> 560.8499999999999
it's rare to see a family structure like

558.57 --> 562.5600000000001
that where it's like you have and is

560.85 --> 564.779
like the generational thing like they

562.56 --> 566.5799999999999
don't really show generational family

564.779 --> 570.0889999999999
will like you have the grande para

566.58 --> 572.13
teaching the grandchild and really it

570.089 --> 574.08
lets the you know that's not and that's

572.13 --> 576.18
something that's very very important

574.08 --> 578.399
like you gotta understand where your

576.18 --> 580.14
family came from where that started and

578.399 --> 583.08
their English that so that you can have

580.14 --> 585.18
a you have more pride in yourself and

583.08 --> 587.3100000000001
everything if you don't have that you

585.18 --> 588.93
don't have that knowledge of where your

587.31 --> 591.27
ancestors came from and all that but you

588.93 --> 592.62
don't where are you supposed to go you

591.27 --> 594.75
got I don't know where you you got to

592.62 --> 596.91
know where you were and then like to

594.75 --> 598.649
understand where you're going like you

596.91 --> 601.23
can't just be like oh well this is a I

598.649 --> 602.79
have nothing to do with my I family

601.23 --> 605.61
whatever I'm just me it's like no you're

602.79 --> 607.3499999999999
true are your family you are that's a

605.61 --> 609.42
part of your legacy so you have to

607.35 --> 612.4200000000001
understand that's it gives that's

609.42 --> 613.4399999999999
another thing like that's that's nothing

612.42 --> 615.329
that really grew up with like

613.44 --> 618.69
understanding your where your people

615.329 --> 622.9499999999999
came from that so that's so and so not

618.69 --> 625.1700000000001
valued as much yeah either for me for me

622.95 --> 627.839
this kind of thing I'm really late kind

625.17 --> 631.41
of almost too late after the family all

627.839 --> 633.36
blew up kind of and a lot of my family

631.41 --> 637.11
members died including my mother and my

633.36 --> 639.57
grandmother and like Gabby the matriarch

637.11 --> 642.839
O'Call support structure as it were

639.57 --> 646.1400000000001
which were those two that upheld it they

642.839 --> 649.5
died and just bang just total shock

646.14 --> 651.87
everyone went their own ways and not

649.5 --> 653.93
directly simultaneously by the way there

651.87 --> 660.43
was like two years in between

653.93 --> 665.6899999999999
yeah my mother and my grandmother but

660.43 --> 668.0
before that yeah we were always

665.69 --> 669.47
bickering pretty much everyone was

668.0 --> 671.62
always bickering but it's kind of like

669.47 --> 676.15
inner natures everybody is always a

671.62 --> 681.98
either a troublemaker or a fixer and

676.15 --> 684.17
always talking yeah and and some people

681.98 --> 688.28
would tip yes um in my family would

684.17 --> 689.9599999999999
typically like not be completely honest

688.28 --> 692.99
about certain things and be very

689.96 --> 695.33
skillful at hiding it that kind of thing

692.99 --> 697.3
so everyone had their own issues and it

695.33 --> 700.46
was all still kind of working together

697.3 --> 705.25
but then when the matriarchs that were

700.46 --> 705.25
really yeah it was kind of matriarchal

705.28 --> 713.6
so we rode Jewish and all that and yeah

711.22 --> 717.02
that's something that came from my

713.6 --> 719.12
grandmom was see I don't think she was

717.02 --> 722.03
officially Jewish but she was like very

719.12 --> 729.14
pro all that and that just echoed

722.03 --> 735.8299999999999
through her but yeah after that's just

729.14 --> 739.49
gone and I don't know yeah I did learn a

735.83 --> 741.35
lot more about where that I know my

739.49 --> 745.67
original point my original point was is

741.35 --> 748.69
that now I figured out that how they are

745.67 --> 752.27
as a person like as an individual

748.69 --> 754.7
consciousness and how they have probably

752.27 --> 759.0799999999999
been responding to everything throughout

754.7 --> 762.38
their life beyond what I have seen of

759.08 --> 763.97
them and respond to society and the

762.38 --> 766.9399999999999
people in society and just get an

763.97 --> 768.5600000000001
average on why they've become the way

766.94 --> 772.25
they have become and is something I've

768.56 --> 774.05
never even really could understand when

772.25 --> 780.47
I was younger and now I get it

774.05 --> 782.51
like they've also been an assault as all

780.47 --> 784.73
their life and pretending like that's

782.51 --> 786.59
not really going on and still trying to

784.73 --> 787.8100000000001
deal with it and somehow find some

786.59 --> 791.99
useful

787.81 --> 797.5699999999999
angle to society and been very adaptive

791.99 --> 802.55
at that always adapting might become

797.57 --> 806.1500000000001
pretty weird in their own ways like that

802.55 --> 809.24
kind of adaptation and tolerance what it

806.15 --> 812.36
does to people is it leaves very

809.24 --> 815.11
childish elements that are obviously

812.36 --> 819.07
like in the way it just leaves it there

815.11 --> 827.27
and it becomes its own weird hidden

819.07 --> 830.84
twist to people at the same time they

827.27 --> 833.21
become like yeah it's the liberal effect

830.84 --> 835.4
they become like blindly convicted to

833.21 --> 837.86
the cause as it were but the causer

835.4 --> 841.1899999999999
comes fake it's more feeling based if

837.86 --> 844.7
their inner feeling they follow an

841.19 --> 847.82
ideology with their motivations that's

844.7 --> 849.6800000000001
what my family naturally did a lot I

847.82 --> 851.2700000000001
don't know what they do now since they

849.68 --> 853.28
were separated they might might have

851.27 --> 858.65
stopped doing that but that was there a

853.28 --> 861.1999999999999
lot and it's just so weird to see to now

858.65 --> 865.0699999999999
look at it and realize what was really

861.2 --> 867.74
going on as a Christian just had no idea

865.07 --> 870.8000000000001
I could barely communicate I could

867.74 --> 873.95
barely understand I was in total

870.8 --> 876.3499999999999
solipsism mode because I just thought

873.95 --> 879.86
like yeah how do I even know every word

876.35 --> 883.16
that those are real people like me they

879.86 --> 888.14
don't talk like me I feel out of place

883.16 --> 890.48
how do I know it's even real okay like

888.14 --> 893.3
feeling wise these issues I wouldn't

890.48 --> 903.1700000000001
like think like that but I just felt

893.3 --> 905.7199999999999
like is this really real socially but I

903.17 --> 906.0799999999999
do now much better it's still kind of

905.72 --> 910.97
weird

906.08 --> 912.8000000000001
you can still feel the people can feel

910.97 --> 915.26
it and hear it in how I communicate with

912.8 --> 918.89
other people and that I don't that I'm

915.26 --> 921.02
not as dynamically fluid as most people

918.89 --> 927.23
can be when they're just really int

921.02 --> 929.75
something I feel like you I feel like

927.23 --> 933.1700000000001
you have that that info but I should

929.75 --> 936.83
like I feel like you do have that like

933.17 --> 940.61
you do have that um you know ability to

936.83 --> 942.6800000000001
be able to really express but after that

940.61 --> 944.21
the same time you still I can understood

942.68 --> 947.39
like you still hold back to certain

944.21 --> 950.1800000000001
things I could still not it's still kind

947.39 --> 951.41
of unsure it's like the shakiness to it

950.18 --> 954.8
at the same time is that what you mean

951.41 --> 958.85
or yeah kind of yeah and it's really

954.8 --> 962.18
annoying because I'm it's like in the

958.85 --> 964.76
way it's in the way but I I have to

962.18 --> 968.3599999999999
ignore it mostly or I'll just run away

964.76 --> 970.3
constantly because you make a lot of

968.36 --> 973.79
sense like you make a lot of like um

970.3 --> 975.65
really good points that in your

973.79 --> 977.63
christening the way that you speak like

975.65 --> 981.8299999999999
you're not thank you just all over the

977.63 --> 983.93
place right feel like that and now this

981.83 --> 988.4000000000001
is an expression have been my skill

983.93 --> 993.1099999999999
focus but the natural spiritual

988.4 --> 997.43
interactions with people that's I'm I'm

993.11 --> 1002.6800000000001
just disadvantaged at it naturally I see

997.43 --> 1004.9599999999999
I understand it's like it's sometimes

1002.68 --> 1007.3599999999999
it's more you you

1004.96 --> 1008.89
sometimes it's easier to deal inward

1007.36 --> 1010.54
like when you're just used to having to

1008.89 --> 1013.48
deal with yourself and would we know

1010.54 --> 1015.43
because of it I was my all my friends

1013.48 --> 1019.9300000000001
have basically been kind of like nerdish

1015.43 --> 1022.9599999999999
people that have the same thing right

1019.93 --> 1028.72
and many of them get over it some of

1022.96 --> 1031.99
them don't you know like there's this

1028.72 --> 1034.63
meme the big this is that you know those

1031.99 --> 1036.42
Lion King beings like they oh it's the

1034.63 --> 1040.3300000000002
one where it's Mufasa and Simba and

1036.42 --> 1042.22
they're both gonna go Pryor rockin Simba

1040.33 --> 1045.01
is like everywhere the well not simple

1042.22 --> 1047.8
but Mufasa is like Simba everywhere the

1045.01 --> 1051.43
light touches is anime or some type of

1047.8 --> 1053.5
or some type of thing of whatever and

1051.43 --> 1054.46
this symbols like what about this

1053.5 --> 1056.53
showing place

1054.46 --> 1057.8700000000001
and then Mufasa like yes social life

1056.53 --> 1062.59
don't go there

1057.87 --> 1064.81
what like that but yes and that's your

1062.59 --> 1066.49
music yes

1064.81 --> 1069.79
I haven't seen that one that sounds

1066.49 --> 1071.14
funny yeah but there's literally been

1069.79 --> 1072.34
one of the thing like it's it's funny

1071.14 --> 1074.98
but it like when you really something

1072.34 --> 1076.72
think about it's like yeah you a lot of

1074.98 --> 1078.19
these people who are who gravitate

1076.72 --> 1080.59
towards those kind of thing have

1078.19 --> 1081.3700000000001
struggled a lot socially socially and

1080.59 --> 1083.11
why is that

1081.37 --> 1086.02
so that's another thing you have to

1083.11 --> 1087.49
start looking at it's like and like

1086.02 --> 1090.76
literally every single person that I've

1087.49 --> 1092.83
met that has this really really into

1090.76 --> 1094.12
anime or really into like comics or

1092.83 --> 1098.5
anything like that a lot of times they

1094.12 --> 1099.9699999999998
have like they have not so good social

1098.5 --> 1102.94
skills of they've gone through some type

1099.97 --> 1104.44
of difficult experiences with being able

1102.94 --> 1106.8400000000001
to communicate with their family or

1104.44 --> 1109.51
their you know anything like that well

1106.84 --> 1114.1
it's like a pattern of that universi

1109.51 --> 1117.37
then yeah it's it's rampant in Japan for

1114.1 --> 1120.9399999999998
example and many Asian countries among

1117.37 --> 1125.05
teenagers especially but yeah in

1120.94 --> 1127.48
traversée that in traversée and being

1125.05 --> 1131.32
obsessed with cartoons or superheroes

1127.48 --> 1133.3600000000001
comics even science fiction the goes

1131.32 --> 1136.98
together it's a form of escape yes all

1133.36 --> 1139.6
these things so it plays into that and

1136.98 --> 1142.39
that's why you have so many people who

1139.6 --> 1143.98
owe like weight like as soon as you said

1142.39 --> 1147.94
science fiction you know automatically

1143.98 --> 1149.35
thought about sorry do like as soon as

1147.94 --> 1151.75
you said science fiction I automatically

1149.35 --> 1153.9399999999998
thought about no space in the globe and

1151.75 --> 1156.16
that's another thing I honestly feel

1153.94 --> 1159.25
like it's so that's one of the key

1156.16 --> 1162.43
points and the key reasons why there are

1159.25 --> 1163.66
so many people at at or like home so

1162.43 --> 1165.97
many of the people that attack flat

1163.66 --> 1169.39
earthers people who love other people

1165.97 --> 1171.97
who attack on julio cynicism are those

1169.39 --> 1173.7700000000002
types of people also like those people

1171.97 --> 1176.26
who are like the extreme nerds the

1173.77 --> 1178.09
extreme science fiction fans and

1176.26 --> 1180.49
everything like that like they're it's

1178.09 --> 1182.26
always them that's doing that but you

1180.49 --> 1184.84
like and they you know like they're like

1182.26 --> 1186.6589999999999
yeah I have to defend my but it's like

1184.84 --> 1187.259
you're just you're attacking bin

1186.659 --> 1189.929
they feel like you're attacking

1187.259 --> 1191.6390000000001
personally like that's how they that's

1189.929 --> 1195.3300000000002
why they come at you like oh my god how

1191.639 --> 1197.399
do you was like dude it's not it's not

1195.33 --> 1198.599
that seriously cuz this cuz the flat

1197.399 --> 1200.6999999999998
earth is like the dumbest thing ever

1198.599 --> 1202.32
right if it's so stupid and so untrue

1200.7 --> 1204.8690000000001
why are you putting all of your energy

1202.32 --> 1207.33
into trying to attack these people in

1204.869 --> 1208.799
this because it's something personal to

1207.33 --> 1210.72
them it's something that they hold

1208.799 --> 1212.7
personally so like you're you're

1210.72 --> 1214.95
basically attacking their foundation

1212.7 --> 1216.8690000000001
when you attack space and he looks and

1214.95 --> 1217.259
she says and then all this other type of

1216.869 --> 1221.359
stuff

1217.259 --> 1227.97
JP is a they defend the dream they trust

1221.359 --> 1231.269
right exactly you know I try today

1227.97 --> 1235.08
they've put dangerous amounts of weight

1231.269 --> 1237.84
on it oh it's okay to have a dream but

1235.08 --> 1240.4499999999998
if you're literally gonna untangle that

1237.84 --> 1243.1789999999999
dream with your real life dealings and

1240.45 --> 1245.3690000000001
your investments and everything then

1243.179 --> 1248.1290000000001
you're working yourself into a problem

1245.369 --> 1250.609
and a flat earther may remind somebody

1248.129 --> 1254.4889999999998
like yeah you should have probably not

1250.609 --> 1259.499
invested that $10,000 into that launch

1254.489 --> 1262.049
of the new satellite you know but you're

1259.499 --> 1263.749
then the the Stockholm kicks in because

1262.049 --> 1267.289
they don't want to admit that they've

1263.749 --> 1271.409
potentially been fooled into a scam so

1267.289 --> 1274.979
then they'll defend it angrily that's

1271.409 --> 1282.5390000000002
what happens that's the system that's a

1274.979 --> 1284.429
trick yeah Oh God by the way did you see

1282.539 --> 1286.889
the link that I posted in the massive

1284.429 --> 1289.8790000000001
beach at this lady

1286.889 --> 1293.359
oh the Astro fit the proud

1289.879 --> 1296.4289999999999
astrophysicist lady I was talking about

1293.359 --> 1299.759
galaxies and gases and how it all

1296.429 --> 1302.779
interacted and it was like holy [ __ ]

1299.759 --> 1307.369
have never seen such condensed serious

1302.779 --> 1317.909
outer space speculation from one yeah I

1307.369 --> 1319.35
put up the link in the sky right what do

1317.909 --> 1321.3600000000001
ya bout this

1319.35 --> 1323.34
like she was really going and so it like

1321.36 --> 1327.0
she was really really passionate and

1323.34 --> 1330.6599999999999
just expressive about it she was just

1327.0 --> 1334.13
telling a nice fairy tale story she was

1330.66 --> 1340.0800000000002
just being a really nice space story

1334.13 --> 1344.2800000000002
basically like zakharik like what I like

1340.08 --> 1350.3899999999999
Star Trek or Star Wars or neil degrasse

1344.28 --> 1354.87
tyson oh yeah but not so basic she was

1350.39 --> 1358.47
she's like nerd bait like ooh yes the

1354.87 --> 1362.9399999999998
smarts pretty decent looking chick you

1358.47 --> 1366.18
know that's like whoa that's another

1362.94 --> 1367.5
thing they do like though whenever

1366.18 --> 1368.73
they're talking about space a lot of

1367.5 --> 1371.3
times they'll have like some really

1368.73 --> 1373.56
really attractive woman or whatever

1371.3 --> 1375.87
neither be the one talking about space

1373.56 --> 1377.94
and it's like people are paying more

1375.87 --> 1380.4899999999998
attention to her than what's you

1377.94 --> 1383.7
actually think right yeah so they can

1380.49 --> 1387.45
associate space dreams and science

1383.7 --> 1388.68
fiction with boners basically yeah

1387.45 --> 1390.8700000000001
that's how they get sued

1388.68 --> 1393.69
you know it's like hey there's hot

1390.87 --> 1395.58
chicks who are into this dude it's well

1393.69 --> 1398.16
it's one of the oldest marketing tricks

1395.58 --> 1401.3
in the book literally since Peter was

1398.16 --> 1403.8500000000001
invented or maybe even before that

1401.3 --> 1406.62
because it's like these people will be

1403.85 --> 1408.78
saying this stuff and it's like they're

1406.62 --> 1410.4599999999998
I know that this person has absolutely

1408.78 --> 1411.18
no idea what they're saying or what

1410.46 --> 1412.8
they're talking about

1411.18 --> 1416.55
they're literally just reading off the

1412.8 --> 1419.43
spirit and there's some like sometimes

1416.55 --> 1421.62
people know but that does kind of break

1419.43 --> 1423.72
the sensation you know when a girl's

1421.62 --> 1427.56
like really telling the story and into

1423.72 --> 1429.63
it then no much more much more powerful

1427.56 --> 1432.0
and I think that this yeah this lady is

1429.63 --> 1435.5400000000002
an astrophysicist so I bet that she is

1432.0 --> 1437.52
definitely passionate about work she was

1435.54 --> 1440.24
literally like constantly in the shot

1437.52 --> 1442.71
showing off her diploma like or her

1440.24 --> 1448.11
graduation of being an astrophysicist

1442.71 --> 1449.7
like like yeah I'm it's all yeah I kind

1448.11 --> 1452.7299999999998
of put a comment in there like yeah

1449.7 --> 1455.46
sorry but it's presuppositional based

1452.73 --> 1458.13
science fiction and the earth is flat I

1455.46 --> 1460.41
am must feel like sorry but on the other

1458.13 --> 1460.7700000000002
hand she's bound to heard about it right

1460.41 --> 1463.88
now

1460.77 --> 1468.3799999999999
but she's probably just really a baller

1463.88 --> 1473.39
trying to defend her hair

1468.38 --> 1477.0900000000001
what is it Harris her studied get

1473.39 --> 1478.71
amazing shape oh of course they have

1477.09 --> 1481.4299999999998
best thing that's why they'll never come

1478.71 --> 1484.08
out like the fact that a lot of these on

1481.43 --> 1486.54
people who are like ballers or like like

1484.08 --> 1489.3
extreme atheists or whatever like this

1486.54 --> 1491.37
this one lady does not like that channel

1489.3 --> 1492.81
the atheist experience like there was a

1491.37 --> 1494.34
flood after that called I don't know if

1492.81 --> 1497.07
you saying it like Redken philosophy

1494.34 --> 1499.83
talks about it a lot oh this clip was

1497.07 --> 1503.31
atheist lady talking and she basically

1499.83 --> 1504.72
said and this is like this totally goes

1503.31 --> 1506.73
against any type of skepticism

1504.72 --> 1509.25
whatsoever they kinda be skeptics he

1506.73 --> 1512.4
said if the scientific rhetoric was to

1509.25 --> 1514.34
come out and say this then I would

1512.4 --> 1517.44
listen to it and I was just like what

1514.34 --> 1519.8999999999999
are you sick so you're so you're basing

1517.44 --> 1523.44
all of your you're basing all of your

1519.9 --> 1525.8700000000001
own basically your your entire

1523.44 --> 1527.49
foundation on whether or not sure the

1525.87 --> 1529.1399999999999
higher up people say anything you don't

1527.49 --> 1531.06
want to think critically for yourself

1529.14 --> 1533.3700000000001
you just go whatever it's safe you're

1531.06 --> 1535.32
like a fangirl my girlfriend like that's

1533.37 --> 1537.1799999999998
what you are essentially like you're not

1535.32 --> 1539.55
a you don't think you have no critical

1537.18 --> 1543.0
thinking skills you don't like you have

1539.55 --> 1545.1599999999999
absolutely no type of well you know you

1543.0 --> 1546.96
were gonna say it you you broke off the

1545.16 --> 1551.16
word but it's kind of like making fan

1546.96 --> 1553.23
fictions that's yes yeah oh look that

1551.16 --> 1556.65
happens a lot it happens you know

1553.23 --> 1560.19
probably in anime a lot but it also

1556.65 --> 1562.65
happens well there glowers do it they

1560.19 --> 1565.29
make their own little speculative routes

1562.65 --> 1568.14
trying to like see if they can figure

1565.29 --> 1571.85
out some new way to prove the earth as a

1568.14 --> 1574.95
ball you know they that's technically

1571.85 --> 1577.4299999999998
fanfiction it is science fiction fan

1574.95 --> 1582.96
fiction that is technically what it is

1577.43 --> 1585.8500000000001
you know it's amazing and I don't I do

1582.96 --> 1588.549
it I like that I used to do that and

1585.85 --> 1591.52
I still do it but I'm very honest that

1588.549 --> 1593.53
it is science fiction but I love that's

1591.52 --> 1596.8899999999999
how I came up with the conspiracy theory

1593.53 --> 1599.049
the proof that there have been no moon

1596.89 --> 1601.24
bases secret moon bases on the backside

1599.049 --> 1603.58
of the moon because if they had built

1601.24 --> 1605.74
that then the weight of the Moon which

1603.58 --> 1609.49
is a lot smaller would shift it would

1605.74 --> 1611.98
make the moon turn because the gravity

1609.49 --> 1614.71
would go would pull the heavier side

1611.98 --> 1616.179
towards the earth naturally and then the

1614.71 --> 1617.65
dark side would suddenly become the

1616.179 --> 1621.039
light side and you would see all the

1617.65 --> 1623.3500000000001
moon bases so that's my proof why there

1621.039 --> 1625.77
are no secret moon bases on the backside

1623.35 --> 1625.77
of the earth

1626.13 --> 1633.0700000000002
now that's fan fiction you know you

1631.539 --> 1637.6
can't necessarily prove it but it makes

1633.07 --> 1639.84
sense yeah like it makes a lot of sense

1637.6 --> 1642.52
I've actually no doubt about that

1639.84 --> 1646.1789999999999
they say that they're on there but we've

1642.52 --> 1649.24
never seen them either well it's been

1646.179 --> 1652.0590000000002
around since the x-files all the secrets

1649.24 --> 1655.32
basis space bases moon bases base on

1652.059 --> 1660.46
Mars face from Mars all these secrets

1655.32 --> 1662.83
glass tubes you know ancient relics and

1660.46 --> 1663.9
things this has been going on for

1662.83 --> 1669.82
decades

1663.9 --> 1678.0700000000002
yeah do you know what if that was real

1669.82 --> 1682.71
then like yeah that's the consequence of

1678.07 --> 1685.6899999999998
your system so did you plan it out right

1682.71 --> 1692.73
didn't you overlook certain mathematical

1685.69 --> 1692.73
details of your constructs it's pretty

1693.6 --> 1699.78
Thanks I literally came up with the

1696.429 --> 1701.89
yesterday on the fly oh you did yeah

1699.78 --> 1703.45
just and that's the thing but that's how

1701.89 --> 1705.22
they taught us like you you end up

1703.45 --> 1707.32
speaking their language because that's

1705.22 --> 1709.63
how they talk they're like well this met

1707.32 --> 1712.059
look if they say all this stuff did they

1709.63 --> 1714.22
were like you saying that it would be

1712.059 --> 1715.78
like oh that's that she's done this like

1714.22 --> 1718.419
but y'all come up with the same time

1715.78 --> 1719.74
like you're like wait y'all come up with

1718.419 --> 1721.42
like stuff that

1719.74 --> 1723.52
he makes absolutely no sense and has no

1721.42 --> 1725.26
relation to reality at all whereas what

1723.52 --> 1727.48
you were trying all in like that

1725.26 --> 1728.89
actually is a good point like there they

1727.48 --> 1730.42
have this obsession with gravity why

1728.89 --> 1732.64
isn't that gravity does not take into

1730.42 --> 1734.74
place we had always text me a question

1732.64 --> 1736.66
when it's convenient for you and not

1734.74 --> 1738.82
when it actually count not what it would

1736.66 --> 1740.38
actually matter like you kid like you

1738.82 --> 1743.08
can say growl d-did this probably think

1740.38 --> 1745.0900000000001
that my brother did do this I don't want

1743.08 --> 1747.55
it to do that and then like that's

1745.09 --> 1749.32
literally how their brains were mm-hmm

1747.55 --> 1750.76
like they could just say whatever and

1749.32 --> 1752.559
they're just like it gravity would be

1750.76 --> 1755.559
what they want gravity help them

1752.559 --> 1757.75
discover Neptune like yeah gravity

1755.559 --> 1761.44
awesome gravity superhero like

1757.75 --> 1763.48
essentially gravity is Superman but but

1761.44 --> 1766.42
it's ridiculous even how they argue this

1763.48 --> 1769.929
out like this helps that it's not true

1766.42 --> 1772.24
it's like a way big way around that they

1769.929 --> 1774.8200000000002
use a giant calculus bridge between

1772.24 --> 1777.03
those concepts and it's too difficult to

1774.82 --> 1780.76
explain into weird how that all works

1777.03 --> 1782.52
but exactly the laws of gravity because

1780.76 --> 1786.04
of the presupposition of gravity

1782.52 --> 1788.97
everything then crystallizes out in a

1786.04 --> 1792.55
certain equilibrium with that system

1788.97 --> 1795.76
then would make these certain details

1792.55 --> 1797.44
effect as you were because that it would

1795.76 --> 1799.6299999999999
not be another possibility anymore

1797.44 --> 1809.26
that's how that function that's how they

1799.63 --> 1811.5100000000002
really reason these things out yeah like

1809.26 --> 1814.54
when you're a master mathematician it's

1811.51 --> 1818.83
like that's why it's like Mathemagician

1814.54 --> 1822.34
it becomes like a holiday if you're a

1818.83 --> 1824.47
real expert in calculus it just becomes

1822.34 --> 1826.24
like a holodeck to you you just see it

1824.47 --> 1830.08
and you can just like oh exactly this

1826.24 --> 1834.27
that that the statistical analysis in my

1830.08 --> 1837.4289999999999
mind that kind of thing will be awesome

1834.27 --> 1841.2
very hard to get rid of like this

1837.429 --> 1846.0590000000002
believing that would be a brutal blow

1841.2 --> 1849.6100000000001
because they'll be very good at it right

1846.059 --> 1853.369
it was a big blow to me that

1849.61 --> 1855.9799999999998
yeah but then I realized wait you don't

1853.369 --> 1857.4189999999999
have to lose it you just don't take it

1855.98 --> 1861.23
so literal

1857.419 --> 1864.2
but it's not gonna go right me that's

1861.23 --> 1868.34
all there is a market for it people want

1864.2 --> 1870.919
it right like this is how I know that

1868.34 --> 1873.4089999999999
like these people are like that people

1870.919 --> 1874.8790000000001
like Neil deGrasse and like people like

1873.409 --> 1877.46
certain types of people are just like

1874.879 --> 1878.899
acting or juice at least like they

1877.46 --> 1880.94
believe it but at the same time they

1878.899 --> 1882.7099999999998
know that they're just acting with

1880.94 --> 1886.1000000000001
everyone because like surgeries that

1882.71 --> 1888.95
they say like oh they'll mix in common

1886.1 --> 1891.309
sense and then try to use that common

1888.95 --> 1895.249
sense to make sense of the non from

1891.309 --> 1897.879
right or other life on it like common

1895.249 --> 1899.8990000000001
sense saying that everybody knows and

1897.879 --> 1903.049
understands in a deeper level and then

1899.899 --> 1906.4089999999999
rub it on to that globe [ __ ] to try

1903.049 --> 1910.549
to see if to the common sense will rub

1906.409 --> 1912.0800000000002
off on it yeah and maybe the more and

1910.549 --> 1913.58
more I started listening to him because

1912.08 --> 1915.85
I was I used to be crazy about him like

1913.58 --> 1920.6
cosmos was one of my favorite shows

1915.85 --> 1922.34
lately me and my grandma like legged but

1920.6 --> 1925.34
now my grandma's like convinced

1922.34 --> 1928.2099999999998
otherwise like she now she's on my side

1925.34 --> 1931.009
with things like she used to be a big

1928.21 --> 1932.96
like she was she was worse than me when

1931.009 --> 1934.94
it came to like space and the universe

1932.96 --> 1936.919
and everything like that I know that

1934.94 --> 1939.44
like she like was like now I was able to

1936.919 --> 1941.45
like talk to her and to show her she was

1939.44 --> 1942.8590000000002
like wow like you like she was like you

1941.45 --> 1945.559
have no idea how much you just rocked my

1942.859 --> 1947.299
world and everything and then I don't to

1945.559 --> 1949.399
make it sound like I converted her but

1947.299 --> 1951.379
it was like that's not it's not really

1949.399 --> 1953.33
what happened it's just she was a able

1951.379 --> 1955.1
to be like no this actually makes sense

1953.33 --> 1957.1999999999998
and that's right

1955.1 --> 1962.6899999999998
you know that's incredible that yeah and

1957.2 --> 1965.23
how old is she she's in her sixties like

1962.69 --> 1968.3300000000002
her late sixties right

1965.23 --> 1969.44
okay that's yeah that's still definitely

1968.33 --> 1974.509
doable my dad

1969.44 --> 1976.909
I pretty much as I did this my flatter

1974.509 --> 1979.19
thing I kind of started talking more and

1976.909 --> 1981.5900000000001
more about it to him and he would he was

1979.19 --> 1982.8200000000002
miraculously opened and he is convinced

1981.59 --> 1984.9499999999998
now - and even though

1982.82 --> 1988.09
certain details it's very because I just

1984.95 --> 1994.549
keep on talking about it at time so yes

1988.09 --> 1997.34
but he was pretty much 60 64 I think

1994.549 --> 2000.6689999999999
when I first started talking to him

1997.34 --> 2002.3799999999999
about it and he yeah you could do it

2000.669 --> 2004.96
it's usually when they're like really

2002.38 --> 2007.63
old like real grandparents like in their

2004.96 --> 2012.3990000000001
seventies they can have like very

2007.63 --> 2015.0390000000002
serious problems yeah they were like in

2012.399 --> 2016.5089999999998
the middle of a very serious face during

2015.039 --> 2020.879
the moon landings and everything for

2016.509 --> 2031.69
example right it's very close to their

2020.879 --> 2034.6589999999999
to why they did things all right so it's

2031.69 --> 2037.99
like literally like um in my own history

2034.659 --> 2039.5490000000002
class like is this is when I was like

2037.99 --> 2041.259
really all the way in bed it like I was

2039.549 --> 2043.36
not convinced that we went to Samoa at

2041.259 --> 2044.799
all even before I became a father her I

2043.36 --> 2047.4699999999998
was I wouldn't go to the moon

2044.799 --> 2049.96
well it was like there's like I was I

2047.47 --> 2052.179
was already like looking at the evidence

2049.96 --> 2053.319
I was if we did not go it doesn't make

2052.179 --> 2054.04
any sense that we haven't been back

2053.319 --> 2055.96
since

2054.04 --> 2058.659
the first one and that they come up with

2055.96 --> 2060.52
all these excuses as to why they haven't

2058.659 --> 2061.81
gone back like there's literally it'd be

2060.52 --> 2063.849
different there was one excuse for

2061.81 --> 2066.5499999999997
there's multiple so it's like no you

2063.849 --> 2071.079
guys that's hilarious

2066.55 --> 2074.829
I was actually up until the last second

2071.079 --> 2076.51
and even someone into Flat Earth I was

2074.829 --> 2078.069
totally convinced that the moon landings

2076.51 --> 2082.329
actually happened and that it was

2078.069 --> 2085.06
absolutely absurd but doable I was

2082.329 --> 2088.03
extremely excited about it because we

2085.06 --> 2090.19
thought like it's so credible that they

2088.03 --> 2093.6690000000003
actually managed to pull that off

2090.19 --> 2096.639
that's there was my angle to it I was I

2093.669 --> 2098.97
was like ready to like let's let's do

2096.639 --> 2098.9700000000003
that again

2099.0 --> 2104.589
but well I guess they have a little

2101.41 --> 2106.69
better like a little better and use the

2104.589 --> 2111.04
new materials that are around and a new

2106.69 --> 2113.26
type of propulsion and I was ready to

2111.04 --> 2114.38
design design the craft and everything

2113.26 --> 2119.36
in

2114.38 --> 2122.51
yeah serious I believe you I did like

2119.36 --> 2124.52
like I believe you definitely like it

2122.51 --> 2126.5800000000004
was you know and it took me a minute to

2124.52 --> 2129.11
get there because I first I was collared

2126.58 --> 2130.88
what I've heard so many conspiracies

2129.11 --> 2134.96
about the moon landings but like like

2130.88 --> 2137.12
about how what I heard one about like it

2134.96 --> 2138.7400000000002
was actually on Russia who went there

2137.12 --> 2140.0
first but then they talked to the aliens

2138.74 --> 2142.85
and aliens didn't want them to come back

2140.0 --> 2145.19
so they made a deal with you know it was

2142.85 --> 2147.08
it was just craziness so I was like

2145.19 --> 2149.21
that's interesting I didn't agree with

2147.08 --> 2152.0299999999997
it but I guess interesting aliens so

2149.21 --> 2158.9
then I yeah like they talk to a leaf on

2152.03 --> 2161.15
the moon come on yes yes but there are

2158.9 --> 2163.31
aliens on the moon that the Russians met

2161.15 --> 2164.6
with before the United States and the

2163.31 --> 2166.61
Russians came back to the United States

2164.6 --> 2168.2599999999998
said these aliens don't want y'all to go

2166.61 --> 2170.1800000000003
there so we're going pretty soon now and

2168.26 --> 2171.92
then yeah literally someone told you

2170.18 --> 2173.6
that like that was their conspiracy

2171.92 --> 2176.42
theory and I was like that's just funny

2173.6 --> 2180.04
you know that sounds loud was it like oh

2176.42 --> 2183.02
my god that sounds like a cover story

2180.04 --> 2186.74
you're damn probably just meeting the

2183.02 --> 2189.95
aliens on the earth it's like the men in

2186.74 --> 2191.8399999999997
black situation they always thought that

2189.95 --> 2195.74
was pretty accurate that was probably a

2191.84 --> 2197.9
man in black situation yeah that we were

2195.74 --> 2201.5
being isolated as Earth because we were

2197.9 --> 2207.2000000000003
acting too barbaric barbarous I always

2201.5 --> 2210.38
thought that you know there's a lot of

2207.2 --> 2214.2799999999997
as so many shows that like that show

2210.38 --> 2216.38
that whole thing about like earth earth

2214.28 --> 2219.3500000000004
rebirth being observed by other beings

2216.38 --> 2220.13
and like being just being on testing and

2219.35 --> 2223.73
being judged

2220.13 --> 2225.7400000000002
oh no but I think that is going on it's

2223.73 --> 2228.35
just yeah but that's so interesting that

2225.74 --> 2231.02
they believe that but then you say you

2228.35 --> 2233.5299999999997
replace aliens with the word with the

2231.02 --> 2236.54
word God or some other type of fancy

2233.53 --> 2239.1800000000003
animation Airy extras their shells extra

2236.54 --> 2242.42
dimensionals to you know yes are

2239.18 --> 2245.6099999999997
interwoven with us they're just not on

2242.42 --> 2249.25
our three-dimensional level

2245.61 --> 2252.3700000000003
right I totally prove that like they

2249.25 --> 2253.87
meddle with us definitely and they

2252.37 --> 2255.7
observe us they know they know

2253.87 --> 2257.2
throughout time so they know everything

2255.7 --> 2262.39
if they touch you they know everything

2257.2 --> 2264.85
about you basically yeah this soap is so

2262.39 --> 2266.56
much about this world that we they're

2264.85 --> 2268.24
like there are people who have tapped

2266.56 --> 2269.89
into it and there are people who and

2268.24 --> 2271.8999999999996
were able to deal with it who are going

2269.89 --> 2273.18
to deal with those otherworldly we

2271.9 --> 2276.4300000000003
almost say otherworldly but like

2273.18 --> 2278.62
interdimensional beings and then there

2276.43 --> 2282.43
are people who interact and they just

2278.62 --> 2284.49
can't handle it right basically they go

2282.43 --> 2287.98
end up going through a complete shock

2284.49 --> 2291.4599999999996
right but the extra dimensional some of

2287.98 --> 2293.28
them actually try to do that it is their

2291.46 --> 2298.14
point and if you are not guided by

2293.28 --> 2301.27
sufficient principle or intuitive

2298.14 --> 2303.7
keeping to the frequency stay staving

2301.27 --> 2305.53
the past staying on the path that kind

2303.7 --> 2307.45
of if you don't do that naturally like

2305.53 --> 2309.88
for example when you're young you're

2307.45 --> 2312.49
taught something that you naturally are

2309.88 --> 2314.2000000000003
there and not like a deviant if you go

2312.49 --> 2317.41
in this kind of thing as a deviant they

2314.2 --> 2319.6
will come and they will break you and

2317.41 --> 2322.0
they will absolutely try to make you

2319.6 --> 2324.5499999999997
insane in order to make room inside of

2322.0 --> 2329.41
your consciousness in the 3d world to

2324.55 --> 2334.48
then take control when the person lose

2329.41 --> 2337.75
control that's what they do so you have

2334.48 --> 2341.64
to be pure to stay untouched when they

2337.75 --> 2346.84
try to do that to you I was very lucky

2341.64 --> 2349.68
lucky and strong retrospect to be honest

2346.84 --> 2352.4500000000003
but yeah right

2349.68 --> 2354.7
but definitely yeah if you if you're

2352.45 --> 2356.83
there and you're not sufficiently guided

2354.7 --> 2361.33
you're not sufficiently prepared and

2356.83 --> 2364.02
it's very hard to even do that then yeah

2361.33 --> 2367.39
you risk these entities just starting to

2364.02 --> 2370.15
get in your face like trolls almost but

2367.39 --> 2372.0699999999997
much more dangerous and you're very

2370.15 --> 2376.06
defenseless against them basically they

2372.07 --> 2381.0800000000004
can use your own minds mind against you

2376.06 --> 2384.2599999999998
and your own feelings against you or a

2381.08 --> 2387.38
cuz they don't have anything their only

2384.26 --> 2389.9300000000003
figments there they don't have anything

2387.38 --> 2394.13
they don't have feelings they they're

2389.93 --> 2398.18
just interfacing through what you are

2394.13 --> 2402.02
and then meddling with your

2398.18 --> 2413.02
consciousness with that that's how I've

2402.02 --> 2416.21
experienced it yeah it's totally deep

2413.02 --> 2419.84
like it's just and like luckily I

2416.21 --> 2421.16
haven't like um like you like you said

2419.84 --> 2423.05
like you're very lucky that you were

2421.16 --> 2424.99
able to let go

2423.05 --> 2427.46
Kumada and everything I haven't had a

2424.99 --> 2429.56
super intense experience like that quite

2427.46 --> 2432.08
bit and I thought and I probably never

2429.56 --> 2435.11
will but I hope that I had never you

2432.08 --> 2437.84
know exhibit out nobody well unless I

2435.11 --> 2440.1200000000003
absolutely have to unless I absolutely

2437.84 --> 2442.13
have to like then out then now you know

2440.12 --> 2445.85
no but you'll never have to that's the

2442.13 --> 2448.55
thing it's part of the trick they

2445.85 --> 2454.97
tricked me into believing that it was

2448.55 --> 2461.3
necessary that I had no choice and that

2454.97 --> 2463.27
was the lie yeah because they're because

2461.3 --> 2467.2400000000002
they are entered like they're our own

2463.27 --> 2468.89
energies that definitely exist that that

2467.24 --> 2472.91
want to help you that want you to be

2468.89 --> 2475.0099999999998
alright that my wants you to I want you

2472.91 --> 2477.3799999999997
to elevate and succeed but they're not

2475.01 --> 2481.28
going to ask you to dislodge your spirit

2477.38 --> 2484.31
from your body exactly amazing and it's

2481.28 --> 2488.8100000000004
typically also the creator's will

2484.31 --> 2492.23
reflect this and that doesn't mean that

2488.81 --> 2494.81
you can never do it but it's like sin in

2492.23 --> 2497.92
a way it will always have a direct

2494.81 --> 2501.89
consequence on you a heavy impact like

2497.92 --> 2507.05
sin tends to do whether it be right away

2501.89 --> 2509.67
or afterward and so does this stuff it's

2507.05 --> 2512.6200000000003
just very dangerous

2509.67 --> 2517.63
in general I just never recommend doing

2512.62 --> 2523.0
that but yeah there are traditions which

2517.63 --> 2525.58
is a part of yeah like so like doesn't

2523.0 --> 2527.92
I'm saying like some people first up for

2525.58 --> 2529.66
it like for certain cultures they do

2527.92 --> 2531.76
that in this a sense of like being able

2529.66 --> 2533.74
to come out of that it makes you it

2531.76 --> 2536.05
makes you stronger like your spirit was

2533.74 --> 2538.45
a bazillion but they bore the proper

2536.05 --> 2542.4100000000003
guidance they actually have like a

2538.45 --> 2546.6099999999997
priesthood almost like a family of being

2542.41 --> 2549.5499999999997
a framework for you a reference point it

2546.61 --> 2552.1600000000003
actually strengthens the spirit of the

2549.55 --> 2554.86
person going through that that makes it

2552.16 --> 2559.87
much safer it's like a temple on the

2554.86 --> 2564.01
other side and I don't I didn't want

2559.87 --> 2570.4
that okay when I went through that was I

2564.01 --> 2572.6200000000003
was i I was desolate in the presence of

2570.4 --> 2576.52
people that didn't even really see me as

2572.62 --> 2580.17
a person honestly so and I didn't

2576.52 --> 2580.17
realize that until much later

2581.22 --> 2588.3399999999997
so yeah I'm sorry too per happy your

2585.01 --> 2591.9700000000003
experience that I asked for it I was

2588.34 --> 2594.88
literally it's like seduced by Lucifer I

2591.97 --> 2597.52
thought like I am so smart I can

2594.88 --> 2600.46
improvise my way out of anything so my

2597.52 --> 2602.98
challenge was I'm just gonna do things

2600.46 --> 2607.15
that people normally don't do just to

2602.98 --> 2611.11
see like to really figure out how crazy

2607.15 --> 2613.78
this world actually is but I have no

2611.11 --> 2616.57
idea how bad it was when I started out

2613.78 --> 2618.7900000000004
doing that and I was basically tricked

2616.57 --> 2623.7400000000002
into like oh yeah you can be part of

2618.79 --> 2625.3
this new powerful structure under

2623.74 --> 2625.66
control and I thought they were the good

2625.3 --> 2639.1600000000003
guys

2625.66 --> 2641.48
it was very naive of me yeah yeah that's

2639.16 --> 2643.339
how they trick a lot of people a young

2641.48 --> 2646.609
into getting in there it's like yeah we

2643.339 --> 2651.14
are in control and even now Illuminati

2646.609 --> 2654.589
is popularized and all that and and sin

2651.14 --> 2656.93
is normalized basically so that all

2654.589 --> 2659.089
plays into that makes it easier for

2656.93 --> 2664.8489999999997
young men and young women to be seduced

2659.089 --> 2668.57
to join a dark confident as it were it's

2664.849 --> 2674.96
very nasty very dangerous for future

2668.57 --> 2677.06
generations right cuz it like right now

2674.96 --> 2681.2
we live in a world where it's very like

2677.06 --> 2683.5099999999998
no war like to me you have to have a you

2681.2 --> 2686.66
have to have a when you have a

2683.51 --> 2689.2400000000002
foundational understanding of what good

2686.66 --> 2691.52
and evil is and you're able to balance

2689.24 --> 2693.77
those energies out we have it when you

2691.52 --> 2696.8
have a balanced understanding of both

2693.77 --> 2700.25
then that's when you can really elevate

2696.8 --> 2701.96
to me because you all submit the

2700.25 --> 2705.829
ultimate task is to be able to overcome

2701.96 --> 2708.4700000000003
all obstacles and then you can elevate

2705.829 --> 2710.0
and excel in life and everything like

2708.47 --> 2713.18
that in in the next life when you

2710.0 --> 2716.48
transition go back home like home has in

2713.18 --> 2720.23
heaven and what she loved

2716.48 --> 2722.3
she's been able to overcome but like

2720.23 --> 2725.329
because of the way society is going

2722.3 --> 2727.13
right now the oppressive forces like

2725.329 --> 2729.079
they want to make it seem like you just

2727.13 --> 2732.2000000000003
have this life in this life only and

2729.079 --> 2734.329
it's like in that so you have to just

2732.2 --> 2736.069
live to the fullest go crazy do whatever

2734.329 --> 2738.8
do the what in this like that's not sure

2736.069 --> 2741.44
it's like yes not that's not this is not

2738.8 --> 2742.6090000000004
it like you're telling people that this

2741.44 --> 2746.359
is it this is all you have and that's

2742.609 --> 2749.5989999999997
not sure and everything like people can

2746.359 --> 2752.18
have hundreds of lifetimes thousands of

2749.599 --> 2756.29
live maybes and cut like you know maybe

2752.18 --> 2762.319
Wow I like to say this is the only life

2756.29 --> 2763.91
time we get to spend as we are now why

2762.319 --> 2766.91
are you unlike Lee you're going to be

2763.91 --> 2769.16
very similar because that's not an

2766.91 --> 2771.56
effective learning experience because

2769.16 --> 2774.98
that's what it's for I believe that's

2771.56 --> 2776.72
yeah we reincarnate that's even did

2774.98 --> 2780.65
according to the religious theories

2776.72 --> 2783.1699999999996
about that it's really to learn and yeah

2780.65 --> 2784.67
progress the spiritual development so

2783.17 --> 2787.82
you're not going to be turning into the

2784.67 --> 2789.859
same type of person every time yeah

2787.82 --> 2793.2200000000003
that's what it's all about learning the

2789.859 --> 2796.4
lessons who came here and joy they all

2793.22 --> 2799.0699999999997
Pony that you have or the certain unique

2796.4 --> 2801.38
qualities it may have and disadvantages

2799.07 --> 2805.3300000000004
also of course everybody has physical

2801.38 --> 2807.8
disadvantage of some kind then yeah just

2805.33 --> 2810.35
that's how it's gonna be this lifetime

2807.8 --> 2813.59
and after this you don't know what

2810.35 --> 2816.3199999999997
you're gonna be like if you're if unless

2813.59 --> 2820.1000000000004
you're just like done because I believe

2816.32 --> 2821.69
that can happen also I don't know if I'm

2820.1 --> 2824.96
good like that's new after this for

2821.69 --> 2827.4500000000003
example I don't know I wanted to but

2824.96 --> 2830.9900000000002
that's not good enough reason just

2827.45 --> 2832.85
wanting to it's usually I think even if

2830.99 --> 2836.75
you don't want to come back you tend to

2832.85 --> 2843.109
come back because all about something

2836.75 --> 2845.359
you're trying to escape yeah like you

2843.109 --> 2846.619
when you're ready to like when you put

2845.359 --> 2848.81
when you have fulfilled your purpose

2846.619 --> 2850.7000000000003
like whatever it is that you were meant

2848.81 --> 2852.7999999999997
to like we are like we all come and see

2850.7 --> 2853.97
we all have a certain destiny when we

2852.8 --> 2856.25
come here we all have a certain my

2853.97 --> 2859.43
purpose so it's like whatever we were

2856.25 --> 2861.4
supposed to contribute to the world and

2859.43 --> 2864.98
everything like that but that's what

2861.4 --> 2866.21
that's what the ultimate task so you

2864.98 --> 2868.01
know like becoming to me and if you

2866.21 --> 2871.13
don't fulfill that if you don't

2868.01 --> 2872.9900000000002
accomplish that then it's like okay like

2871.13 --> 2875.3900000000003
okay try it try this again try this one

2872.99 --> 2876.2799999999997
more time like because even with like on

2875.39 --> 2878.5699999999997
mm-hmm

2876.28 --> 2879.8900000000003
it like you know like so it's like it's

2878.57 --> 2882.17
like a trial and error thing like I

2879.89 --> 2885.109
think those I think of life and this is

2882.17 --> 2887.51
in the most respectful way like I think

2885.109 --> 2890.0
of life as a video game essentially and

2887.51 --> 2892.13
not at night and like in that like the

2890.0 --> 2895.369
greatest video game ever that was the

2892.13 --> 2898.21
glue maybe like a DVD game where you get

2895.369 --> 2900.9500000000003
to the chance to replay the game and

2898.21 --> 2903.59
rebuild your character with challenge

2900.95 --> 2905.0299999999997
and it's like okay what there are the

2903.59 --> 2907.1600000000003
issues that you couldn't get through

2905.03 --> 2908.5890000000004
earlier what are you going to do to

2907.16 --> 2913.1189999999997
compensate that

2908.589 --> 2916.46
right like try a different approach

2913.119 --> 2918.6800000000003
right exactly so I'm like what were the

2916.46 --> 2920.15
things that you like didn't find before

2918.68 --> 2922.3089999999997
that you're gonna find in this new game

2920.15 --> 2923.809
and everything like like just like

2922.309 --> 2926.1800000000003
certain avenues that you didn't explore

2923.809 --> 2927.7690000000002
before like I love gangs like that were

2926.18 --> 2929.0
you like even after you beat it there's

2927.769 --> 2931.339
stuff that you might have missed that

2929.0 --> 2932.359
you can go back and do again and do even

2931.339 --> 2933.92
better than you did before

2932.359 --> 2936.88
and all that's happened stuff like

2933.92 --> 2940.4300000000003
that's like it's social I feel like I

2936.88 --> 2942.079
feel like that's how life is in a lot of

2940.43 --> 2944.45
cases and they win this like okay I'm

2942.079 --> 2946.549
I've done fulfill my purpose do you know

2944.45 --> 2950.0589999999997
how to come back you know like basically

2946.549 --> 2952.19
like you that's it you know it was like

2950.059 --> 2954.23
but like you like that's what I'm saying

2952.19 --> 2955.7000000000003
like when you're told that you only have

2954.23 --> 2957.17
this life and you don't have any other

2955.7 --> 2959.779
you don't have anything else like when

2957.17 --> 2963.14
you die you just die that's a very very

2959.779 --> 2965.72
dark mindset to live in like when you

2963.14 --> 2967.3089999999997
when you feel like you when you feel

2965.72 --> 2970.43
like there's nothing when you're afraid

2967.309 --> 2975.98
of death in a very intimate it agitates

2970.43 --> 2977.96
your fear of death yes yeah yeah you're

2975.98 --> 2980.299
not supposed to be afraid of them like

2977.96 --> 2982.609
you're not because like we're like suit

2980.299 --> 2985.16
like death is just another part of life

2982.609 --> 2988.4
and everything like you when you to me

2985.16 --> 2991.3089999999997
you only truly die quote-unquote when

2988.4 --> 2993.619
you when you're when you're like when

2991.309 --> 2996.8900000000003
you are not free like to me you can be

2993.619 --> 2998.509
alive and be totally bit mm-hmm be

2996.89 --> 3003.3689999999997
living is a good point but we get

2998.509 --> 3005.17
through everything like it's yes Prison

3003.369 --> 3008.7400000000002
Prison meant to me that's the real death

3005.17 --> 3010.599
like not you dying your spirit like this

3008.74 --> 3013.089
about this vessel that you were born in

3010.599 --> 3015.67
now now that you're now that you have

3013.089 --> 3018.119
passed on you're free from that vessel

3015.67 --> 3020.65
and everything like that and now you can

3018.119 --> 3022.2690000000002
you know like you can go home or you can

3020.65 --> 3023.17
go like and you can do more than you

3022.269 --> 3027.43
were able to do before

3023.17 --> 3029.41
and everything and then so it's like so

3027.43 --> 3031.69
it's like is that fear they like your

3029.41 --> 3033.49
program to basically fear that and

3031.69 --> 3035.14
you're in your programs would be don't

3033.49 --> 3037.75
look feel like you're insignificant and

3035.14 --> 3040.3289999999997
that you have no purpose it's the exact

3037.75 --> 3041.45
opposite of what would like even talking

3040.329 --> 3045.1000000000004
about your life sir

3041.45 --> 3047.5699999999997
it isn't it's a direct contradiction of

3045.1 --> 3049.16
what they teach you about what this

3047.57 --> 3051.6800000000003
universe is they teach you that this

3049.16 --> 3056.6299999999997
universe is so vast and you're just a

3051.68 --> 3058.6699999999996
tiny speck but not a speck in this

3056.63 --> 3061.4300000000003
universe you have actually no

3058.67 --> 3063.8
significance you just happen to appear

3061.43 --> 3065.12
you just happen to be here and blah blah

3063.8 --> 3066.77
blah don't think that you're special

3065.12 --> 3069.0499999999997
don't think that you're significant or

3066.77 --> 3071.12
there's somebody watching over you it's

3069.05 --> 3073.79
funny how that works because it reminds

3071.12 --> 3075.5899999999997
me of the gas pressure without a country

3073.79 --> 3078.8
a container thing it's like what they do

3075.59 --> 3082.8500000000004
is make the spirits are insignificant

3078.8 --> 3083.75
that experience to be gas which is

3082.85 --> 3086.24
interesting

3083.75 --> 3087.8
assuming the origin of the word that

3086.24 --> 3091.1299999999997
it's basically because of the

3087.8 --> 3111.8900000000003
insignificance and the endless fastness

3091.13 --> 3119.21
of space all right no probably just bit

3111.89 --> 3125.23
noisy sorry don't worry you're a great

3119.21 --> 3129.32
guest on the team like with the noise

3125.23 --> 3132.41
what I was saying we were talking about

3129.32 --> 3134.9300000000003
the spirit and had the discouraging

3132.41 --> 3136.94
factor of the heliocentric religion and

3134.93 --> 3139.58
I was comparing it to the second law of

3136.94 --> 3142.2200000000003
thermodynamics how the spirit could be

3139.58 --> 3144.5299999999997
conceived as gas which has an

3142.22 --> 3149.24
interesting shared origin of the word

3144.53 --> 3152.59
also and then yeah that basically what

3149.24 --> 3155.2099999999996
they do is suck the spirit out of you

3152.59 --> 3159.8
with their attorneys vacuum and they're

3155.21 --> 3161.6
in significance of it all that's deep I

3159.8 --> 3165.4900000000002
never thought about that that makes a

3161.6 --> 3168.19
lot of sense and like it's like it even

3165.49 --> 3173.12
even with the whole thing that's why

3168.19 --> 3173.9700000000003
human nature is - we know like our

3173.12 --> 3176.589
purpose

3173.97 --> 3178.5989999999997
internally but when we come into a world

3176.589 --> 3181.57
where we're told we have no purpose or

3178.599 --> 3183.9700000000003
your purpose is not you have to define

3181.57 --> 3185.17
you have to find your own purpose and

3183.97 --> 3186.64
that's thing your purpose is already

3185.17 --> 3188.92
defined before you got here you already

3186.64 --> 3191.3689999999997
knew what your purpose was and there you

3188.92 --> 3193.869
know that internally but you're told

3191.369 --> 3195.4
what you're supposed to do and what

3193.869 --> 3197.05
you're supposed to be you won't be

3195.4 --> 3199.51
successful unless you have a lot of

3197.05 --> 3201.9100000000003
money you won't be empty thing and so

3199.51 --> 3203.44
you have this until you have a bunch of

3201.91 --> 3205.5099999999998
friends a bunch of this about two that

3203.44 --> 3208.359
you're constantly told what you need to

3205.51 --> 3210.9100000000003
have in order to be something right

3208.359 --> 3214.0
you're constantly told that and this and

3210.91 --> 3215.89
it continues to diminish the spirit

3214.0 --> 3217.9
literally you're told what you're

3215.89 --> 3220.15
supposed to be in this like no let me

3217.9 --> 3222.31
let me that's what you deserve it

3220.15 --> 3225.79
replaces it it's like the conditioning

3222.31 --> 3228.58
effect natural spirit has impulses in it

3225.79 --> 3230.56
but if you get conditioned constantly

3228.58 --> 3233.38
then eventually that conditioning will

3230.56 --> 3237.69
replace the normal spirits behavior so

3233.38 --> 3245.1600000000003
in that sense yes it replaces the spirit

3237.69 --> 3247.54
conditioning so if you don't know what

3245.16 --> 3249.43
this is well I'm thankful that I had a

3247.54 --> 3251.71
fount of spiritual foundation growing up

3249.43 --> 3253.54
because I probably I won't so that I

3251.71 --> 3255.79
would still have a very because I was

3253.54 --> 3258.7
very young floaty as a child I know

3255.79 --> 3262.57
didn't seem like I am but when I was

3258.7 --> 3264.31
what I was like I was like the most the

3262.57 --> 3267.5800000000004
most friendly the most well I was

3264.31 --> 3271.119
totally unaware of anything at all I was

3267.58 --> 3275.65
just totally just so like just detached

3271.119 --> 3279.46
from like the status quo just totally

3275.65 --> 3281.619
detached from that and I was own and I

3279.46 --> 3283.75
was bullied a lot when I was younger but

3281.619 --> 3286.27
because I had like cuz I was just so I

3283.75 --> 3287.8
was different and I didn't really care

3286.27 --> 3290.2
about what anyone thought about me and I

3287.8 --> 3293.17
really did get I just had that kind of

3290.2 --> 3295.33
mentality so it's like hey even little

3293.17 --> 3297.01
children even showed their are

3295.33 --> 3297.88
threatened by that and it's like it's

3297.01 --> 3300.67
weird because you think all children

3297.88 --> 3302.65
think like you but they don't so I

3300.67 --> 3305.2000000000003
realized that growing up it's like

3302.65 --> 3306.27
sometimes children have to be already

3305.2 --> 3308.3999999999996
told from

3306.27 --> 3309.81
very young age about what they're

3308.4 --> 3312.4500000000003
supposed to be and how you're supposed

3309.81 --> 3313.62
to think and in being everything like

3312.45 --> 3314.97
that this spirit is already being

3313.62 --> 3318.06
suppressed so when they see someone

3314.97 --> 3323.1899999999996
whose spirit is totally just free and

3318.06 --> 3325.41
open that that that makes them upset it

3323.19 --> 3328.4700000000003
disdain realizes like they want to be

3325.41 --> 3332.1
free but yeah they don't experience it

3328.47 --> 3333.93
it's suppressed right so they try to

3332.1 --> 3336.36
suppress you which I'm surprised that

3333.93 --> 3337.98
person he has that energy is there like

3336.36 --> 3340.83
what makes you think that you're so you

3337.98 --> 3344.16
know saying they do this and it's really

3340.83 --> 3345.96
sad especially we especially when it's a

3344.16 --> 3347.94
child it's like it's one thing when it's

3345.96 --> 3349.17
an adult that's really and adults

3347.94 --> 3351.57
definitely shouldn't do that every like

3349.17 --> 3353.76
so little bit so much like someone who's

3351.57 --> 3355.92
your peer someone that's the same age as

3353.76 --> 3358.4700000000003
you you're supposed that that Congress

3355.92 --> 3361.9500000000003
chose to have social interactions but

3358.47 --> 3365.0099999999998
they don't even want to say you know

3361.95 --> 3366.27
they would rather this you mean to you

3365.01 --> 3367.92
and bully you in every way that so I

3366.27 --> 3371.94
literally had to just make up my own

3367.92 --> 3374.07
world like make up my own in order to

3371.94 --> 3375.57
feel special like you know I had I have

3374.07 --> 3379.86
my family of course but I had to make up

3375.57 --> 3384.03
my own world in order to really feel

3379.86 --> 3385.86
like I had times like that and that and

3384.03 --> 3387.1800000000003
you know in the long run I can see how

3385.86 --> 3389.1600000000003
that would oh I can see how that

3387.18 --> 3390.8399999999997
definitely affected me in the long run

3389.16 --> 3393.89
but later on I was able to get friends

3390.84 --> 3396.6000000000004
that got more like me but I still I

3393.89 --> 3398.1
still had that spirit that was just

3396.6 --> 3401.91
slowly removed totally detached from

3398.1 --> 3404.85
everything and then like being bullied

3401.91 --> 3406.92
at that age did it did affect me to a

3404.85 --> 3408.66
certain degree where I still am so

3406.92 --> 3411.84
conscious of certain things that I do

3408.66 --> 3413.52
surger did I say like what I said when I

3411.84 --> 3416.9100000000003
was younger I was a lot more expressive

3413.52 --> 3419.25
than I am now like I had like I feel

3416.91 --> 3422.22
more comfortable with you but going out

3419.25 --> 3423.96
in public I literally feel like it's

3422.22 --> 3425.25
better if I don't speak because I don't

3423.96 --> 3427.32
want to be looked at a certain way I

3425.25 --> 3428.55
don't want to be yeah I don't want to

3427.32 --> 3432.03
want to make fun of Madilyn when this

3428.55 --> 3435.11
talk about me but is really bad I have

3432.03 --> 3439.36
that to a little but I I do have like my

3435.11 --> 3442.0
standard communication mode as it were

3439.36 --> 3444.4
yeah I have a like I do have a standard

3442.0 --> 3445.9
but I still literally my brain is on

3444.4 --> 3447.82
overload like oh my god make sure I

3445.9 --> 3450.34
don't say anything so yeah yeah really

3447.82 --> 3453.31
so you do one what kind of connects

3450.34 --> 3455.3500000000004
really yeah like I wish I could but I

3453.31 --> 3456.85
have to find people who like the same

3455.35 --> 3459.42
things that I like that's the only way I

3456.85 --> 3463.06
feel comfortable right it's rarity yeah

3459.42 --> 3464.9500000000003
yeah yeah but you do know immediately

3463.06 --> 3469.0
when you bump into one because they're

3464.95 --> 3471.58
looking as well so yeah like literally

3469.0 --> 3474.01
like one of my best friends like we have

3471.58 --> 3476.92
this similar thing where were you know

3474.01 --> 3478.3900000000003
like we were really self-conscious to

3476.92 --> 3481.27
certain degree like we you know we're

3478.39 --> 3483.8199999999997
but um I don't she's able to talk to me

3481.27 --> 3486.19
baby people and I'm she feels like I'm

3483.82 --> 3487.54
more social than to you and it's true

3486.19 --> 3489.25
but I'm able to put on a good face and

3487.54 --> 3490.81
seemed like but act like there's

3489.25 --> 3492.91
absolutely nothing wrong with me like I

3490.81 --> 3495.1
just seem like I'm just totally like

3492.91 --> 3498.16
yeah like you would think I had all

3495.1 --> 3500.74
that's going on but look like once he

3498.16 --> 3502.0899999999997
works you dig in a little more I've it's

3500.74 --> 3505.0299999999997
not to come out more like I'm more

3502.09 --> 3507.1000000000004
self-conscious I'm more my goal what do

3505.03 --> 3508.38
I say we're ready like you know once he

3507.1 --> 3510.91
gets to know me a little bit more

3508.38 --> 3514.12
everything but when you first meet me

3510.91 --> 3517.24
out I'll be very like bright and social

3514.12 --> 3519.1
like baby blah blah you know and then

3517.24 --> 3521.68
like if I get a negative response I

3519.1 --> 3522.04
automatically shut down and just like oh

3521.68 --> 3524.44
my god

3522.04 --> 3525.82
what did I do and that and that's litter

3524.44 --> 3528.58
that literally comes from me being

3525.82 --> 3530.4700000000003
younger and that happening tonight so

3528.58 --> 3534.19
you do still have to response that it's

3530.47 --> 3537.6099999999997
you because I I get negative response

3534.19 --> 3541.3
from people at all but I always know

3537.61 --> 3545.8
that it's usually just them and that I

3541.3 --> 3548.32
kind of draw every spawns out like I

3545.8 --> 3551.29
make them reach a critical mass and

3548.32 --> 3557.38
that's why they just blurt it out me

3551.29 --> 3560.35
because that has happened yeah yeah

3557.38 --> 3562.51
that's definitely definitely think that

3560.35 --> 3564.88
I've been through a lot and I and I know

3562.51 --> 3567.01
how to work on it I'm happy

3564.88 --> 3569.44
growing up up constantly well I was

3567.01 --> 3571.3900000000003
really attracted to shows that talk

3569.44 --> 3571.96
about embracing yourself embracing who

3571.39 --> 3573.17
you are

3571.96 --> 3575.119
like those

3573.17 --> 3577.099
like somebody would get picked on a lot

3575.119 --> 3578.539
like there was like this mean girl

3577.099 --> 3579.829
whatever and there's like the main

3578.539 --> 3581.96
character have to deal with the mean

3579.829 --> 3584.38
girl and I would imagine myself in that

3581.96 --> 3587.029
position and overcoming those obstacles

3584.38 --> 3588.88
like what like with that character in

3587.029 --> 3591.68
that show like being attached Knutson

3588.88 --> 3593.569
they different stated like but they were

3591.68 --> 3595.3689999999997
stated in life certain shows our

3593.569 --> 3597.799
graduates were pretty was relating to

3595.369 --> 3599.619
what I was going through but it's good

3597.799 --> 3602.5099999999998
all my life it's always been that

3599.619 --> 3605.539
literally overcoming the worst of the

3602.51 --> 3609.8900000000003
worst and getting out of it like oh yeah

3605.539 --> 3612.17
and instill that me yeah I still have it

3609.89 --> 3614.0589999999997
sometimes with very young characters in

3612.17 --> 3617.75
series or movies that I really if

3614.059 --> 3622.369
they're played out like smart dynamic

3617.75 --> 3625.76
people and that I have their issues I

3622.369 --> 3628.13
really do reflect back on that my own

3625.76 --> 3632.2990000000004
youth because I had a lot of challenges

3628.13 --> 3634.67
and very little even motivation to do

3632.299 --> 3640.009
with all those challenges I just wanted

3634.67 --> 3645.44
I dug into the fantasy more yeah

3640.009 --> 3656.69
computer games and fantasy world things

3645.44 --> 3660.079
like Lord of the Rings Dragon where are

3656.69 --> 3662.9900000000002

3702.68 --> 3706.97
I think it's you're such a great

3705.14 --> 3714.1299999999997
conversationalist we're really

3706.97 --> 3717.74
I feel on the level you have such a wide

3714.13 --> 3719.9
understanding of things spiritual things

3717.74 --> 3723.2
I really noticed that you understand my

3719.9 --> 3725.23
terminology and actually and you can

3723.2 --> 3728.6899999999996
relay these things yourself it's just

3725.23 --> 3733.22
your great guest thanks for being there

3728.69 --> 3737.329
yes thanks for thanks for arriving to

3733.22 --> 3739.25
the flat or a scene oh you know I feel

3737.329 --> 3742.2200000000003
like it was like once I got into it I

3739.25 --> 3744.819
was like yeah this is I've been in this

3742.22 --> 3744.819
a long time

3745.339 --> 3750.0499999999997
yeah this is a long time coming cuz I

3747.349 --> 3752.7200000000003
feel even more enlightened now than I

3750.05 --> 3754.01
did before when I did you know when I

3752.72 --> 3756.79
thought it was a globe I couldn't even

3754.01 --> 3759.3190000000004
more by now like everything thing that I

3756.79 --> 3763.19
did growing up it makes so much more

3759.319 --> 3764.93
sense versus versus like before the the

3763.19 --> 3766.55
you know the whole insignificance I know

3764.93 --> 3769.339
I know I'm significant I know that I

3766.55 --> 3771.26
have a purpose I know that I'm here for

3769.339 --> 3774.319
a reason and everything like that by I

3771.26 --> 3776.119
know that well it's always like once I

3774.319 --> 3777.74
came into that it just everything is

3776.119 --> 3780.26
made more sense to me like I look at the

3777.74 --> 3782.93
Sun in a completely different way now I

3780.26 --> 3785.21
look at the Sun and the more tonight and

3782.93 --> 3788.089
I honor the Sun book it's weird because

3785.21 --> 3790.609
either the Sun before but now was like I

3788.089 --> 3792.8289999999997
know I know this you're here for me and

3790.609 --> 3795.0499999999997
I have a even deeper understanding of

3792.829 --> 3796.76
that now like I know that I know that

3795.05 --> 3798.23
the Sun was placed here by the Creator

3796.76 --> 3800.69
the moon was placed there by the Creator

3798.23 --> 3804.56
for me to look after us

3800.69 --> 3806.089
so watch over us but it's not you know

3804.56 --> 3809.48
I'm saying well I don't have to battle

3806.089 --> 3810.8289999999997
with what quote-unquote science is

3809.48 --> 3812.54
saying because it's not really science

3810.829 --> 3815.27
it saying that pseudoscience it's a

3812.54 --> 3818.27
philosophy the real science is telling

3815.27 --> 3819.77
you that you are the center the roasted

3818.27 --> 3821.78
like the real science to lead at the

3819.77 --> 3824.69
real ciyon system it's showing you

3821.78 --> 3827.96
literally that all of this had to be

3824.69 --> 3830.78
created all of this like everything that

3827.96 --> 3833.599
the sun's functionality the wave affects

3830.78 --> 3836.0600000000004
us physically and emotionally and

3833.599 --> 3838.6090000000004
spiritually it's such a it's so powerful

3836.06 --> 3840.32
it's a design that's how I like to

3838.609 --> 3844.7599999999998
emphasize

3840.32 --> 3847.9100000000003
yes it's by design all of it right all

3844.76 --> 3851.38
of it and also it has weird elements to

3847.91 --> 3857.2999999999997
it because there are just misleading

3851.38 --> 3860.08
elements to the psychology yes with

3857.3 --> 3865.5800000000004
present in the design and that is just

3860.08 --> 3867.44
it is like an artist genius like they're

3865.58 --> 3868.79
just fooling around because they can

3867.44 --> 3870.35
because they're dead

3868.79 --> 3873.29
deep of a designer with their

3870.35 --> 3876.56
understanding it's area that really

3873.29 --> 3879.2
shows the divine nature of it that

3876.56 --> 3884.23
there's trickery naturally present in

3879.2 --> 3884.23
the design of all things that is just

3887.92 --> 3895.4900000000002
like how did God even think up like the

3892.88 --> 3898.2200000000003
freaking globe of the heavens and that

3895.49 --> 3899.8999999999996
it would make you believe if you make

3898.22 --> 3905.4199999999996
you able to presuppose that you're

3899.9 --> 3909.4700000000003
actually on the globe that's just what's

3905.42 --> 3912.23
funny about it is that if I like um like

3909.47 --> 3913.7599999999998
people and that's the thing like whether

3912.23 --> 3916.4900000000002
I've heard that a lot like people who

3913.76 --> 3918.8300000000004
have presuppose that because of the way

3916.49 --> 3921.7099999999996
things look but to me if I was never

3918.83 --> 3923.93
told that we lived on that we lived on a

3921.71 --> 3925.82
globe I would just see it as it is and

3923.93 --> 3927.62
that's like literally all I see now I

3925.82 --> 3930.4700000000003
see that we're surrounded by still it

3927.62 --> 3931.6099999999997
like a celestial sphere and everything

3930.47 --> 3934.1899999999996
like that like that's what it looks like

3931.61 --> 3937.07
to me like everything's like around us

3934.19 --> 3938.4500000000003
but like weird but like in terms of like

3937.07 --> 3941.75
what we're standing on what we're

3938.45 --> 3943.46
standing on is not a part of that it's

3941.75 --> 3945.74
not in this life it's I mean it is a

3943.46 --> 3947.54
part of it but it's not a shape you know

3945.74 --> 3948.7999999999997
I'm saying like we're on the play it's

3947.54 --> 3951.5299999999997
like we're in the center were on this

3948.8 --> 3953.9900000000002
plane and we're surrounded by this why

3951.53 --> 3955.1000000000004
this celestial sphere with the Stars and

3953.99 --> 3956.6899999999996
the planets and the Sun and Moon

3955.1 --> 3959.08
attached to it that's how I pictured the

3956.69 --> 3961.7000000000003
universe like we're inside of an egg

3959.08 --> 3965.93
basically that's not victory well we're

3961.7 --> 3971.89
inside of a life chamber yeah this realm

3965.93 --> 3971.89
was designed for the life obviously

3972.33 --> 3977.2599999999998
exactly like it's like literally like

3974.38 --> 3979.48
our planet is look like no other and you

3977.26 --> 3981.82
know like no other place like they say

3979.48 --> 3982.69
that is other finest is ever there's

3981.82 --> 3984.9700000000003
other Earth's

3982.69 --> 3986.38
that's another desaad that's another

3984.97 --> 3988.0899999999997
trick that they're trying to pull like

3986.38 --> 3990.4300000000003
oh you this this other Earth's out there

3988.09 --> 3994.21
just like our earth blah blah blah

3990.43 --> 3996.43
again no one's ever like they're just

3994.21 --> 3999.04
making all this stuff up to cause even

3996.43 --> 4000.62
more and more insignificant and

3999.04 --> 4003.81
everything like that

4000.62 --> 4006.15
it was like it's like no weird literally

4003.81 --> 4009.17
like this is this is where we are this

4006.15 --> 4011.88
is our world and it's the most perfect

4009.17 --> 4013.5
like well I can't think of a better

4011.88 --> 4015.9
place that would be able to harbor life

4013.5 --> 4018.84
and where earth was able to do it in

4015.9 --> 4023.04
such a uniform fashion it's like music

4018.84 --> 4024.57
it's like so it's so amazing Layton that

4023.04 --> 4027.45
the little girl just keeps on going

4024.57 --> 4029.57
regardless of what we're doing mm what's

4027.45 --> 4032.33
going on in the world just keeps on

4029.57 --> 4035.9
keeps going it's it's a good place it's

4032.33 --> 4041.46
really designed to do that place amazing

4035.9 --> 4043.8
you could almost say that and this is

4041.46 --> 4045.83
just theoretical okay but it might I

4043.8 --> 4053.4
might be wrong at it but it's been

4045.83 --> 4056.04
argued from from Christian side that we

4053.4 --> 4058.11
could not even destroy the earth even if

4056.04 --> 4060.93
we tried and we have tried before

4058.11 --> 4063.54
because God just designed it in a way

4060.93 --> 4069.75
that it is impossible to do that like no

4063.54 --> 4071.58
no single human or even a group of

4069.75 --> 4076.38
people under control of humans can do

4071.58 --> 4079.08
that you can ruin yourself you know

4076.38 --> 4083.03
destroy your civilization but eventually

4079.08 --> 4087.18
nature will always be able to somehow

4083.03 --> 4091.11
yeah remake itself and the deaths and I

4087.18 --> 4095.1
have this odd belief and this is purely

4091.11 --> 4099.089
belief this is it's like a weird feeling

4095.1 --> 4101.549
a weird sensory that the Creator the

4099.089 --> 4104.7699999999995
designer the designer of this realm does

4101.549 --> 4107.89
occasionally just out

4104.77 --> 4117.400000000001
we're introduces new species they just

4107.89 --> 4121.18
appear who knows maybe the maybe there

4117.4 --> 4123.94
are freaking weird al' gray aliens and

4121.18 --> 4127.33
that it was actually introduced even as

4123.94 --> 4129.58
part of the weird plan or something and

4127.33 --> 4131.92
it's all been taken by the globalists

4129.58 --> 4134.5289999999995
and the power brokers to turn into a

4131.92 --> 4136.51
boogeyman I don't know if that's how the

4134.529 --> 4139.150000000001
resilience tend to think of it they're

4136.51 --> 4141.99
very like no aliens are actually allies

4139.15 --> 4146.23
from the from the other dimension

4141.99 --> 4148.75
naturally yeah but I don't call them

4146.23 --> 4152.62
aliens I found something else but like I

4148.75 --> 4155.29
heard that it makes it very easy just to

4152.62 --> 4162.91
not trigger people with Flat Earth that

4155.29 --> 4165.73
way yeah like people understand yeah

4162.91 --> 4167.589
your science fiction ball [ __ ] all over

4165.73 --> 4169.419999999999
the place it's all acceptable and as

4167.589 --> 4171.88
soon as you say but the earth is flat II

4169.42 --> 4175.93
know it's all wrong

4171.88 --> 4177.7
you must be M yeah that's a part of the

4175.93 --> 4179.2300000000005
program because that's literally what

4177.7 --> 4180.88
you pictured when we picked our planet

4179.23 --> 4183.6089999999995
we picked our globe that's what we

4180.88 --> 4186.06
picture so I was like thanks I don't

4183.609 --> 4189.1900000000005
wants a globe anything can happen

4186.06 --> 4194.109
yeah but as soon as you deny the globe

4189.19 --> 4197.2
then it can't be possible right and

4194.109 --> 4199.150000000001
that's why I'm this way I was like to a

4197.2 --> 4202.09
certain degree I still struggle with it

4199.15 --> 4206.71
like when I see it I'm just like you

4202.09 --> 4208.6
disgust me well I should I kind of

4206.71 --> 4211.5
attitude like what it's like you just

4208.6 --> 4214.780000000001
you know say this is like you know like

4211.5 --> 4216.76
so like like I picture when I picture

4214.78 --> 4219.37
the world I just picture all the

4216.76 --> 4221.4400000000005
beautiful lands and like the like the

4219.37 --> 4223.96
sun shining on the mountains the ocean

4221.44 --> 4226.179999999999
that's what I picture where I am there

4223.96 --> 4228.34
like that when I pick but I don't really

4226.18 --> 4230.17
picture the outside too much cuz I don't

4228.34 --> 4231.9400000000005
hope the outside looks like and that old

4230.17 --> 4233.43
I probably never will not in this

4231.94 --> 4236.95
lifetime we're not in this physical body

4233.43 --> 4237.34
but um like before I got here I probably

4236.95 --> 4240.97
knew

4237.34 --> 4244.06
but since I'm here I have no idea so

4240.97 --> 4246.46
it's like it's like just come into this

4244.06 --> 4249.01
discovery and really really it might

4246.46 --> 4250.33
mean for me anything and it was

4249.01 --> 4253.4800000000005
essentially what you said about what the

4250.33 --> 4257.59
Christians say and what I practiced it

4253.48 --> 4259.45
actually states that the creator himself

4257.59 --> 4262.18
said what I have created can never be

4259.45 --> 4263.8
destroyed like that's little it

4262.18 --> 4270.12
literally says that and what I would I'd

4263.8 --> 4273.04
be what I practice yeah stupid Satanist

4270.12 --> 4276.25
Luciferian [ __ ] think you're so

4273.04 --> 4279.04
awesome you can do it and I bet you

4276.25 --> 4280.84
they're trying they're doing anything

4279.04 --> 4282.61
they can to try they're even getting

4280.84 --> 4283.75
more blatant about it it's just not

4282.61 --> 4287.25
working

4283.75 --> 4292.39
there's emergency systems in place I

4287.25 --> 4295.6
think just from the creation itself not

4292.39 --> 4297.9400000000005
from a group of people I think there's

4295.6 --> 4299.950000000001
just emergency systems probably in place

4297.94 --> 4303.82
that just prevent this [ __ ] from

4299.95 --> 4306.73
happening from really aggravating like

4303.82 --> 4308.799999999999
maybe potential cleaning systems in the

4306.73 --> 4313.0
air that'll just if it gets bad enough

4308.8 --> 4316.74
just clean it up for example I don't

4313.0 --> 4319.63
know I'm getting very speculative today

4316.74 --> 4325.51
all this spirit talk is really loosen up

4319.63 --> 4328.18
my spirit yes it's so much like like I

4325.51 --> 4330.46
love I love being able to talk about it

4328.18 --> 4331.87
like because it's just like you know

4330.46 --> 4333.55
there's so much that we don't know and

4331.87 --> 4335.71
speculating on it is the fun part of it

4333.55 --> 4339.49
ever ever well I will close this quote

4335.71 --> 4342.22
I'd rather have I'd rather have

4339.49 --> 4345.13
questions that are wait no I'd rather

4342.22 --> 4347.26
have yeah I'd rather have questions that

4345.13 --> 4348.7300000000005
can't be answered then have answers that

4347.26 --> 4353.91
can't be questioned I love that quote

4348.73 --> 4357.3099999999995
because it literally shows you

4353.91 --> 4360.01
especially like what's going on now it

4357.31 --> 4362.4400000000005
shows you how everything works how it

4360.01 --> 4363.49
really works it's like it's more we live

4362.44 --> 4366.969999999999
in a world where nothing can be

4363.49 --> 4370.21
questioned but everything can be but at

4366.97 --> 4372.25
the same time everything can be young

4370.21 --> 4374.65
unless they want you to question this

4372.25 --> 4376.81
unless you you know it's okay to

4374.65 --> 4377.2
question your existence to question your

4376.81 --> 4379.120000000001
being

4377.2 --> 4381.849999999999
so care to do that but it's not okay to

4379.12 --> 4384.97
question what so we can still tell you

4381.85 --> 4387.79
what you are and who you are and you

4384.97 --> 4389.92
can't question it like they have you can

4387.79 --> 4394.6
link whatever you want as long as it is

4389.92 --> 4397.87
in this way exactly yep and they're like

4394.6 --> 4400.93
that directly goes against skepticism

4397.87 --> 4403.2699999999995
and in universal thinking it comes it

4400.93 --> 4404.92
directly contradicts that right when a

4403.27 --> 4407.71
minute a really critical thinking then

4404.92 --> 4409.81
you can basically presuppose anything

4407.71 --> 4413.1
that's what I've been trying to do like

4409.81 --> 4415.4800000000005
I can presuppose the heliocentric cosmos

4413.1 --> 4418.51
definitely we can I think I've proven

4415.48 --> 4420.82
that well enough by now in the last few

4418.51 --> 4423.280000000001
years but I can also presuppose the

4420.82 --> 4424.96
earth to be disk and I can also pre

4423.28 --> 4427.42
supposed to be the earth to be a

4424.96 --> 4430.63
rectangular looping realm of all kinds

4427.42 --> 4433.6
of dimensions and design elements to

4430.63 --> 4435.85
them like I can presuppose all these

4433.6 --> 4438.6
things and I'm not really sticking to

4435.85 --> 4442.6
one of them because I have no

4438.6 --> 4444.25
confirmation no empirical confirmation

4442.6 --> 4447.820000000001
of these things I have plans on how to

4444.25 --> 4449.74
get this confirmation that I can't just

4447.82 --> 4452.17
address you just yet because I don't

4449.74 --> 4454.57
have the financial capacity basically

4452.17 --> 4458.25
but I know how to address them but

4454.57 --> 4461.009999999999
because I am NOT bound by some singular

4458.25 --> 4464.29
train of thought by some specific

4461.01 --> 4468.16
presupposition I can presuppose them all

4464.29 --> 4470.98
and learn about it and learn what it

4468.16 --> 4473.7699999999995
actually is why it formed what its

4470.98 --> 4478.11
function is what its influence is on the

4473.77 --> 4481.63
wider groups of people on the longer I

4478.11 --> 4485.0199999999995
study the influence of information on

4481.63 --> 4488.35
the mind it is probably one of the most

4485.02 --> 4490.6
the biggest overarching study personal

4488.35 --> 4495.1
study that just goes really into the

4490.6 --> 4497.320000000001
spiritual and fine sensory analysis I I

4495.1 --> 4498.570000000001
one know how this is all going to

4497.32 --> 4501.63
influence everyone

4498.57 --> 4504.0599999999995
yeah on the long run the Flat Earth

4501.63 --> 4506.28
awakening especially because we already

4504.06 --> 4509.1
know very on the short run what for

4506.28 --> 4512.429999999999
example the whole insane social justice

4509.1 --> 4515.13
warrior movement has wreaked upon the

4512.43 --> 4517.35
the public we already have seen the

4515.13 --> 4519.63
direct consequences of that but I want

4517.35 --> 4523.110000000001
to know what this will do all all of

4519.63 --> 4525.3
this on the long run not just while it's

4523.11 --> 4527.91
going while people are working with it

4525.3 --> 4533.52
and developing on the long run afterward

4527.91 --> 4541.8
what's what's it gonna do mm very

4533.52 --> 4549.21
curious and we have enough having fun

4541.8 --> 4551.85
sorry no no I agree and this what is it

4549.21 --> 4553.86
like because I constantly wonder cuz

4551.85 --> 4556.17
it's gonna cost like if things are gonna

4553.86 --> 4558.2699999999995
continue to spread they can try to shut

4556.17 --> 4560.04
it down as much as they want to but once

4558.27 --> 4562.26
it hits enough people's ears people are

4560.04 --> 4565.62
not gonna stop talking about it like

4562.26 --> 4568.08
I've never I've never seen flutter have

4565.62 --> 4570.66
talked about this much ever and like

4568.08 --> 4572.34
forever with us literally because of the

4570.66 --> 4574.62
power of the Internet this topic is

4572.34 --> 4576.18
getting out there and people and you

4574.62 --> 4579.63
have people who actually have common

4576.18 --> 4582.240000000001
sense who have you know cuz you have

4579.63 --> 4585.09
people who have the shoes but then you

4582.24 --> 4586.139999999999
have people who are genuine and who are

4585.09 --> 4589.32
actually trying to put the information

4586.14 --> 4591.030000000001
out there go trying to tell you and it's

4589.32 --> 4594.12
not just about the earth being flat it's

4591.03 --> 4596.25
about everything but because that's the

4594.12 --> 4598.94
but people think why does it matter what

4596.25 --> 4601.14
the shape of the earth is globalization

4598.94 --> 4602.879999999999
global this global that global warming

4601.14 --> 4607.46
global everything is literally in every

4602.88 --> 4610.53
single political rhetoric the globe so

4607.46 --> 4613.89
retaining the earth is not that it

4610.53 --> 4616.08
destroys the whole narrative well not

4613.89 --> 4618.990000000001
necessarily it just shows that they are

4616.08 --> 4622.05
religiously biased that they are part of

4618.99 --> 4625.17
this structure this framework that they

4622.05 --> 4628.02
are in a conspiracy an information

4625.17 --> 4630.129
conspiracy that they've signed up to

4628.02 --> 4636.499000000001
that

4630.129 --> 4638.719
yep it's like a guild exactly upholding

4636.499 --> 4641.478999999999
that information put you into line of

4638.719 --> 4645.499
that narrative gives you the options in

4641.479 --> 4648.319
the background and potentially can make

4645.499 --> 4650.719
you part of either being an experiencer

4648.319 --> 4653.419000000001
if you're a true believer and you can go

4650.719 --> 4655.939
with the ride and actually think it's

4653.419 --> 4659.599
real or you can be a programmer in the

4655.939 --> 4661.549
background and actually help design the

4659.599 --> 4667.189
events because they are basically

4661.549 --> 4669.229
trickery events that are organized and

4667.189 --> 4672.279
you have to have a fine understanding of

4669.229 --> 4676.909000000001
influence on the public and all that and

4672.279 --> 4679.099
what people want to see so this is

4676.909 --> 4682.339
what's going on there that's really NASA

4679.099 --> 4686.089
and the media on top of that the media

4682.339 --> 4689.079
that are part of that narrative all

4686.089 --> 4689.079
right I think it's pretty interesting

4689.979 --> 4697.849
yeah it's very interesting as a system

4694.659 --> 4700.8189999999995
yeah it's very similar to really

4697.849 --> 4703.549
religion to for example if in

4700.819 --> 4706.779
Christianity how it there's in America

4703.549 --> 4709.999
as far as I've gathered a lot of

4706.779 --> 4712.219
Christian narrative groups as well that

4709.999 --> 4714.648999999999
the political group that really uphold

4712.219 --> 4718.569
that and the churches that really latch

4714.649 --> 4720.679
onto that and separate media that are

4718.569 --> 4727.4490000000005
individuals that basically form networks

4720.679 --> 4731.059
with it and it's better I guess it's not

4727.449 --> 4733.308999999999
but it's it works in the same type of

4731.059 --> 4735.859
frame it's a natural formed framework

4733.309 --> 4737.4490000000005
the difference with the globe narrative

4735.859 --> 4739.879000000001
framework is it's much more powerful

4737.449 --> 4742.938999999999
much bigger the bankers are into that so

4739.879 --> 4743.659
they have a lot of money and it is a

4742.939 --> 4747.859
cult

4743.659 --> 4751.009
it's literally fooling their target

4747.859 --> 4753.799
audience well for example the right-wing

4751.009 --> 4757.399
group is really trying to push their

4753.799 --> 4760.309
target audience to wake up and become

4757.399 --> 4761.570000000001
active as they say and start basically

4760.309 --> 4764.18
working and

4761.57 --> 4766.49
and spreading the word and that that's

4764.18 --> 4770.06
what that system is pretty much is

4766.49 --> 4773.8099999999995
starting to become but it's more honest

4770.06 --> 4777.4400000000005
at least they're not yet they still have

4773.81 --> 4781.700000000001
issues here and there and but ya know

4777.44 --> 4783.98
it's maybe a sloppy comparison but I'm

4781.7 --> 4787.429999999999
very interested in narrative systems in

4783.98 --> 4789.379999999999
general in the media and the cognitive

4787.43 --> 4793.43
dissonance is between them is also very

4789.38 --> 4795.77
fascinating because they do ride upon

4793.43 --> 4797.6900000000005
one another and literally taking things

4795.77 --> 4799.97
out of context and the funny thing is

4797.69 --> 4805.3099999999995
that when one group does that to another

4799.97 --> 4808.58
group the people that follow the one

4805.31 --> 4811.25
that's doing that very rarely even

4808.58 --> 4815.15
checks the original source to see if

4811.25 --> 4817.55
it's out of context they rarely actually

4815.15 --> 4821.66
check that that's a given statistical

4817.55 --> 4824.95
fact and I catch myself often doing it

4821.66 --> 4828.38
as well I used to check it a lot more

4824.95 --> 4830.69
but then you don't check it you just

4828.38 --> 4833.51
judge it on first glance like is this

4830.69 --> 4836.24
out of context or is it over emphasized

4833.51 --> 4837.92
or you just judge it you don't go and

4836.24 --> 4840.349999999999
search the original materials anymore

4837.92 --> 4841.4
because you are looking at media all day

4840.35 --> 4845.900000000001
you don't have the time to check

4841.4 --> 4849.11
everything and so that's the key word

4845.9 --> 4851.75
you don't have the time yeah and the

4849.11 --> 4853.04
patience yeah you have to really in

4851.75 --> 4855.8
order to really know what's going on you

4853.04 --> 4859.31
have to really invest your time in it

4855.8 --> 4862.400000000001
and and they set it up to be so

4859.31 --> 4866.39
convoluted and so twisted that you

4862.4 --> 4868.82
really have to spend like like all of

4866.39 --> 4874.360000000001
this energy untangling this web that

4868.82 --> 4878.299999999999
they've so masterfully into society and

4874.36 --> 4879.65
like no even when you have a bunch of

4878.3 --> 4882.53
other people that are also doing that

4879.65 --> 4885.28
with you it's still so difficult like

4882.53 --> 4889.5199999999995
they've created something that is so

4885.28 --> 4892.0599999999995
complex and so like just in this and the

4889.52 --> 4892.06
thing is like

4892.46 --> 4897.53
it's not that it can't be you know taken

4895.1 --> 4899.09
down or it can't be broken down but it's

4897.53 --> 4902.15
literally like they've set it up in a

4899.09 --> 4906.17
way where it would it would have to take

4902.15 --> 4908.839999999999
an entity that's more overarching then

4906.17 --> 4911.63
they are in order to shut everything

4908.84 --> 4913.1900000000005
down and you know and they and then

4911.63 --> 4916.429
we're gonna have to go against the

4913.19 --> 4920.509999999999
bank's that's the issue yeah they have

4916.429 --> 4924.679
the bank's very directly related it's

4920.51 --> 4928.13
like a broader to them to the globe

4924.679 --> 4934.4490000000005
serious there are a significant part of

4928.13 --> 4937.4890000000005
it it is like their financial money cow

4934.449 --> 4940.07
because there is so much money because

4937.489 --> 4944.718999999999
of it there's so much enthusiasm and

4940.07 --> 4948.23
trust false trusts because of it exactly

4944.719 --> 4950.57
and that makes people throw money around

4948.23 --> 4952.82
and have money shortage and that's where

4950.57 --> 4957.23
the banks make their grow some of their

4952.82 --> 4960.67
money unless they just outright print it

4957.23 --> 4963.349999999999
but then usually eventually their

4960.67 --> 4967.7300000000005
consequences do kind of happen Society

4963.35 --> 4974.150000000001
but it's to their advantage to keep the

4967.73 --> 4978.169999999999
globe going very much so because it

4974.15 --> 4981.739
opens up people's pockets naturally on

4978.17 --> 4983.87
average and it's amazing like you

4981.739 --> 4986.299999999999
wouldn't think even though the program

4983.87 --> 4988.429
responds why would they lie why would

4986.3 --> 4995.900000000001
why did it have to do this shape and

4988.429 --> 5001.27
it's like to me it could have been it's

4995.9 --> 5004.96
not so much like the shape I mean I can

5001.27 --> 5010.4490000000005
see this is what I think like um you're

5004.96 --> 5012.4
playing with clay right and when you're

5010.449 --> 5015.849999999999
trying to make a ball out of that clay

5012.4 --> 5017.679
it takes so much manipulation and so

5015.85 --> 5021.1
much structure and so much for me to

5017.679 --> 5023.56
make that perfect perfectly even smooth

5021.1 --> 5026.14
sphere and it's like literally they're

5023.56 --> 5027.6
taking they took the world in the palm

5026.14 --> 5030.88
their hands and they said we're going to

5027.6 --> 5032.02
but it's like you know it like you have

5030.88 --> 5034.57
someone like rubbing their hands

5032.02 --> 5035.830000000001
together like like muah ha ha like doing

5034.57 --> 5038.71
that it's like literally like that's

5035.83 --> 5041.59
what they did they took the world real

5038.71 --> 5044.65
like not just the world but the universe

5041.59 --> 5046.72
essentially and shaped it into this

5044.65 --> 5048.58
perfect ball it was something of their

5046.72 --> 5051.64
creation something that they wanted to

5048.58 --> 5053.35
make right so that they wanted to form

5051.64 --> 5056.89
in their hands unless like I have the

5053.35 --> 5059.56
power to shape your entire world yeah

5056.89 --> 5061.18
and in doing so that's what in that

5059.56 --> 5062.740000000001
that's the reason why their influence

5061.18 --> 5063.9400000000005
and their power is so prominent because

5062.74 --> 5065.55
they're literally took the world in

5063.94 --> 5071.139999999999
their hands and shaped it into a ball

5065.55 --> 5073.3
mm-hmm you know like those we can fool

5071.14 --> 5077.14
people very small in the mental level

5073.3 --> 5082.72
then you have control over their minds

5077.14 --> 5087.6
and they may never know about it you

5082.72 --> 5090.22
know that's part of the why it's there

5087.6 --> 5091.96
I'm sorry Jessica I love this

5090.22 --> 5094.96
conversation but I'm gonna have to route

5091.96 --> 5096.82
it out it's like almost almost hurt

5094.96 --> 5099.7
pains me to do it because it's really

5096.82 --> 5101.349999999999
good do come back please please do oh

5099.7 --> 5103.0
yeah you're an awesome guest if you

5101.35 --> 5105.280000000001
could come back and we could basically

5103.0 --> 5109.0
continue this conversation or start a

5105.28 --> 5111.67
new one I love it oh yeah yeah I'll try

5109.0 --> 5114.43
to tune in tomorrow hmm and everything

5111.67 --> 5116.47
all right but I'm gonna run out the show

5114.43 --> 5117.01
right now and then see if I can still

5116.47 --> 5121.030000000001
get them

5117.01 --> 5123.04
Nathan's panel yeah was lunch because

5121.03 --> 5129.639999999999
this conversation definitely made me

5123.04 --> 5131.68
hungry yeah every times like talking

5129.64 --> 5133.63
about the globe earth and I always start

5131.68 --> 5140.17
to think about the molten chocolate core

5133.63 --> 5142.81
I like to visualize the earth like that

5140.17 --> 5145.66
a lot better you know you know it's more

5142.81 --> 5152.92
appealing that way because who doesn't

5145.66 --> 5155.17
like chocolate balls no I'm sorry like I

5152.92 --> 5158.88
don't know if this I seem like I'm

5155.17 --> 5163.8
really mature but when I hear that word

5158.88 --> 5168.72
not laughs this is okay yeah I heard it

5163.8 --> 5174.99
I heard it after I said it was like [ __ ]

5168.72 --> 5178.79
from South Park yeah softie balls right

5174.99 --> 5181.74
yeah I'm talking about the candy variety

5178.79 --> 5190.41
in this case right you can interpret it

5181.74 --> 5194.15
however you like thank you for being on

5190.41 --> 5196.47
the panel Jessica oh thank you forever

5194.15 --> 5199.259999999999
all right thank you forgive me with the

5196.47 --> 5202.95
noise and stuff it hasn't been too bad

5199.26 --> 5203.37
overall just sometimes little but it.we

5202.95 --> 5205.2
good

5203.37 --> 5209.15
I'm definitely gonna listen back to this

banana which is still don't used because

through super chats or even better

5307.38 --> 5314.64
through PayPal and there's also patreon

5311.54 --> 5317.22
also decide that I have started up a

5314.64 --> 5318.42
GoFundMe to get the camera because I

5321.24 --> 5327.0599999999995
