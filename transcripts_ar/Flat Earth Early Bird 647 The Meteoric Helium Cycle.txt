51.36 --> 56.0
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

54.0 --> 58.16
number 647

56.0 --> 59.92
i'm your host irwin and before we start

58.16 --> 62.07899999999999

59.92 --> 63.84
on any platform you deem fit and if you

62.079 --> 65.43900000000001
haven't already subscribe to my channel

63.84 --> 66.799
and hit the bell notification so you

65.439 --> 69.03999999999999
know when i'm going live

66.799 --> 70.08000000000001
which is normally 2 p.m amsterdam time

69.04 --> 73.52000000000001
every day

70.08 --> 75.759
please also do support my channel and me

73.52 --> 77.439
through the paypal patreon the super

75.759 --> 78.24
chat and the membership system join

77.439 --> 81.6
button

78.24 --> 83.67999999999999
that'd be much appreciated very helpful

81.6 --> 85.67999999999999
and thank you everyone that has

83.68 --> 88.24000000000001
supported me

85.68 --> 90.0
during yeah the last few years

88.24 --> 93.52
especially

90.0 --> 97.28
recent months uh yeah

93.52 --> 100.15899999999999
the show is is go is gonna continue so

97.28 --> 101.28
thanks to all of your support today the

100.159 --> 104.399
weather is

101.28 --> 106.07900000000001
uh i don't know it's

104.399 --> 107.43900000000001
kind of cloudy right now but it was

106.079 --> 110.79899999999999
actually

107.439 --> 113.03999999999999
not as heavily clouded as you might see

110.799 --> 114.56
from the com the light contrast a little

113.04 --> 117.92
bit more in the distance

114.56 --> 122.159
it's not been rainy though

117.92 --> 123.84
and yeah it's still okay

122.159 --> 126.71900000000001
it is a bit fresh though you know i'm

123.84 --> 129.36
sitting here in my shirt

126.719 --> 131.2
whatever i had actually a sweater on

129.36 --> 135.59900000000002
earlier

131.2 --> 135.599
and i have my heater on there so

138.4 --> 140.8
anyway

141.44 --> 150.07999999999998
all right so

144.72 --> 150.08
i got tamara coffee nt

153.2 --> 157.76
and i got notes and i got a chat so

156.64 --> 160.64
let's see who is

157.76 --> 160.64
in this chat

161.12 --> 168.84
good germans first over moko

164.72 --> 172.56
lumberjack and there's ace hey

168.84 --> 172.56
hello huh

173.2 --> 181.44
so yeah good to see you so far i expect

176.56 --> 181.44
more to be leaking in soon uh

181.599 --> 185.51899999999998
all right yeah i was on uh iron realm

184.08 --> 188.72
and just after that

185.519 --> 189.59900000000002
spurs chemo and yeah that was still

188.72 --> 192.4
going when my

189.599 --> 194.39999999999998
show was supposed to start so i kind of

192.4 --> 196.64000000000001
forgot a little bit about it that's why

194.4 --> 199.84
i'm five minutes late instead of exactly

196.64 --> 199.83999999999997
on time

201.04 --> 206.879
right but yeah

204.319 --> 209.35999999999999
it was interesting to listen to spurski

206.879 --> 211.2
most hang out especially

209.36 --> 212.72000000000003
and yeah with iron realm it was also

211.2 --> 215.28
interesting they're talking about some

212.72 --> 219.599
meteorite coming down in brazil

215.28 --> 221.92
10th of august not that long ago at all

219.599 --> 223.599
was it the 20th i don't remember but

221.92 --> 225.83999999999997
just got me thinking a lot

223.599 --> 227.44
again about majors like what is that

225.84 --> 229.20000000000002
where is it coming from

227.44 --> 230.959
and then putting it next to an issue

229.2 --> 232.56
that we had been discussing on the flat

230.959 --> 235.68
earth debate recently

232.56 --> 238.31900000000002
that is okay so what actually happens to

235.68 --> 240.64000000000001
all the helium gas up there

238.319 --> 242.0
because it's not gonna go down go boom

240.64 --> 244.95899999999997
boom anytime soon

242.0 --> 246.4
right right relative density it's gonna

244.959 --> 249.76
stay up there

246.4 --> 251.84
but that would mean that over the ages

249.76 --> 253.04
literally this is a natural consequence

251.84 --> 257.759
of of just

253.04 --> 260.32
excluding any mechanic to alter it

257.759 --> 261.199
potentially yeah the helium gas is

260.32 --> 262.88
literally

261.199 --> 265.12
every time it's generated it's going to

262.88 --> 266.479
float up and then it's going to stay

265.12 --> 267.28000000000003
there and it's going to increase it's

266.479 --> 269.84
going to build up

267.28 --> 272.0
over the ages more and more and more

269.84 --> 276.08
within the container

272.0 --> 279.44
that would be logical so

276.08 --> 281.59999999999997
yeah we're not in a completely helium

279.44 --> 284.88
filled realm

281.6 --> 288.16
you know so there must be something

284.88 --> 289.44
transforming it to to lower the helium

288.16 --> 291.44
levels

289.44 --> 293.6
now we can all speculate about that

291.44 --> 297.12
vastly like who is the sun doing that

293.6 --> 301.199
no the sun helios and all that

297.12 --> 305.68
right but then i considered like

301.199 --> 308.8
wait if there's also meteors coming down

305.68 --> 312.40000000000003
then maybe and this is like

308.8 --> 314.32
yeah can't really lay any chemistry

312.4 --> 316.71999999999997
connections or anything like that but

314.32 --> 319.12
maybe there isn't like this electrical

316.72 --> 322.56
process of some kind

319.12 --> 325.84000000000003
or some kind of fusion you know some

322.56 --> 329.12
kind of weird fusion that

325.84 --> 332.23999999999995
actually absorbs the helium

329.12 --> 335.919
and then maybe even turns it

332.24 --> 335.919
into meteorites

336.0 --> 340.56
you know it's kind of ironic because in

338.479 --> 344.71999999999997
the heliocentric story meteorites

340.56 --> 347.6
which are a lot of metals supposedly

344.72 --> 349.759
sun ejections there or dying stars

347.6 --> 353.44
floating around pieces of dying stars

349.759 --> 355.759
or dead stars exploding stars so

353.44 --> 359.12
yeah maybe there is something to this

355.759 --> 362.24
maybe meteorites are actually

359.12 --> 364.4
a side effect of helium

362.24 --> 366.24
piling up up there and then maybe after

364.4 --> 367.84
a certain critical mass this process

366.24 --> 370.56
starts

367.84 --> 371.039
and then as almost as rain comes down

370.56 --> 373.68
out of

371.039 --> 374.479
big clouds as they build up more moist

373.68 --> 378.08
then maybe

374.479 --> 380.4
meteorites from somewhere up there

378.08 --> 382.96
start to form and come down after a

380.4 --> 385.12
critical helium mass buildup

382.96 --> 386.56
see and then you get into natural

385.12 --> 390.479
weather cycles

386.56 --> 393.36
so maybe it could be potentially

390.479 --> 395.199
in that direction somehow and then it's

393.36 --> 397.44
interesting because

395.199 --> 399.199
if you think about it like that like a

397.44 --> 401.68
weather type of cycle

399.199 --> 402.639
helium builds up a meteorite comes down

401.68 --> 407.28000000000003
at some point

402.639 --> 411.84000000000003
right well then if you think about it

407.28 --> 415.44
you could actually potentially test this

411.84 --> 418.08
and maybe it has been tested

415.44 --> 420.24
maybe you could potentially summon

418.08 --> 423.599
meteorites by literally

420.24 --> 426.479
pumping a lot of helium up in the air

423.599 --> 428.24
i don't know how it would work i bet

426.479 --> 431.599
those that

428.24 --> 433.199
do know if really this is a real thing

431.599 --> 436.8
that they know exactly how that would

433.199 --> 438.96000000000004
work and they might already be using it

436.8 --> 441.199
you know to create signs from the

438.96 --> 444.4
heavens that are inexplicable

441.199 --> 445.68
by literally timing it all out in a

444.4 --> 448.71999999999997
schedule

445.68 --> 451.919
this day this year we put this much

448.72 --> 454.08000000000004
out and then if everything works out in

451.919 --> 456.34999999999997
the calculations then at that point in

454.08 --> 459.389
that location the meteor comes down

456.35 --> 459.389
[Music]

460.479 --> 467.12
ay what do you think

464.16 --> 467.12
what do you think guys

471.44 --> 479.68
another step in the direction of a

474.72 --> 481.8
meteor meteoric natural phenomena

479.68 --> 483.36
to be able to explain that

481.8 --> 486.56
presuppositionally

483.36 --> 491.199
but with falsifiable side to it

486.56 --> 494.72
isn't that interesting can i have some

491.199 --> 497.52000000000004
feedback on that from chat

494.72 --> 497.52000000000004
what do you think

498.56 --> 501.68
or feel about it

503.68 --> 507.199
right because where else is all that

505.759 --> 510.16
helium going

507.199 --> 511.91900000000004
is the helium just going out of the vent

510.16 --> 514.08
like god is like okay there's this

511.919 --> 515.1999999999999
amount of helium okay let's vent it up

514.08 --> 518.32
into heaven

515.2 --> 520.5600000000001
because it's too much it's not good

518.32 --> 521.599
and then what happens see that it

520.56 --> 524.399
already kind of like

521.599 --> 525.839
makes it a little bit weirder even and

524.399 --> 527.44
not balanced that

525.839 --> 529.9200000000001
like that would mean that the realm is

527.44 --> 532.399
not really completely self-containing

529.92 --> 534.399
it's not perfectly recycling because the

532.399 --> 537.519
healing would have to be vented off

534.399 --> 540.32
well that seems something that's

537.519 --> 541.04
that i as a realm designer personally

540.32 --> 545.44
would not

541.04 --> 548.0
do that see i'd go with natural cycles

545.44 --> 551.44
all of it

548.0 --> 554.0
not saying that there is no other

551.44 --> 556.24
like heaven like physical realm anywhere

554.0 --> 559.839
and that god or whatever

556.24 --> 563.279
anything is there that they could come

559.839 --> 565.839
just saying that

563.279 --> 567.6
as a designer i personally if if

565.839 --> 571.12
designing a realm

567.6 --> 573.36
i wouldn't make it not completely

571.12 --> 576.16
self-sustaining i wouldn't have this

573.36 --> 576.72
element that as a director i would have

576.16 --> 579.279
to

576.72 --> 581.2
switch every now and then because

579.279 --> 582.56
otherwise it would crash i wouldn't do

581.2 --> 584.8000000000001
that as a designer

582.56 --> 584.8
see

586.8 --> 590.64
how would helium fuse into meteors yeah

589.44 --> 594.48
well you got me there

590.64 --> 596.399
amarok i don't know

594.48 --> 599.44
but technically if you think about the

596.399 --> 602.72
concept of fusion

599.44 --> 606.1600000000001
then yeah with if there's

602.72 --> 608.88
x if the electrical energy is

606.16 --> 611.12
high enough then all kinds of weird

608.88 --> 613.92
transmutation like processes start to

611.12 --> 613.92
happen anyway

615.2 --> 622.0
and who knows maybe it is actually

618.88 --> 622.0
the electrical

623.04 --> 628.16
side effects of the sun that actually

626.399 --> 631.2
transmutes it

628.16 --> 633.8389999999999
so not not even the sun

631.2 --> 635.44
as a heat points and there the helium is

633.839 --> 638.9590000000001
absorbed and then

635.44 --> 641.44
changed but rather just the sunlight

638.959 --> 642.399
in its strongest maybe that actually

641.44 --> 644.399
alters

642.399 --> 647.839
helium somehow maybe that slowly

644.399 --> 647.839
transforms it

648.16 --> 653.76
and i don't know after that you know

651.519 --> 656.079
it's still kind of i could imagine that

653.76 --> 656.72
maybe helium gas could transform into

656.079 --> 660.0
like

656.72 --> 663.279
powder meteor powder but how does it all

660.0 --> 664.079
melt how does it all come together into

663.279 --> 667.2
a big

664.079 --> 669.4399999999999
rock that would be a bigger mystery

667.2 --> 670.24
and now i could kind of equate that with

669.44 --> 673.2790000000001
how heal

670.24 --> 675.92
stones and big clouds go around and then

673.279 --> 677.4399999999999
eventually get out of it they gather it

675.92 --> 680.4799999999999
up

677.44 --> 682.6400000000001
so would there then be a transformed

680.48 --> 686.32
helium meteorite dust

682.64 --> 686.88
storm going on somewhere really insanely

686.32 --> 690.5600000000001
high up

686.88 --> 692.0
way beyond our site outside of the

690.56 --> 695.279
hydrological

692.0 --> 696.64
storm cycle like an upper storm that we

695.279 --> 701.92
can never see

696.64 --> 703.4399999999999
because it's too far away or something

701.92 --> 705.4399999999999
and then when i think about that that

703.44 --> 709.0400000000001
kind of reminds me

705.44 --> 710.639
of what uh chris moncelier was kind of a

709.04 --> 713.92
glober

710.639 --> 716.16
who what he basically had modeled out he

713.92 --> 716.8
said that there was this weird plasma

716.16 --> 720.079
dust

716.8 --> 722.959
situation going on very high

720.079 --> 725.279
up and he said that that is where the

722.959 --> 725.5999999999999
where the physical planets are moving

725.279 --> 730.16
and

725.6 --> 732.32
very weird but yeah maybe

730.16 --> 733.36
the idea that there is a height where

732.32 --> 736.32
there is like

733.36 --> 737.6
plasma going on and other materials

736.32 --> 740.0
hanging around

737.6 --> 741.279
maybe electrostatically suspended

740.0 --> 743.44
somehow

741.279 --> 744.639
who knows because it's in proximity to

743.44 --> 747.12
the top

744.639 --> 748.399
electrostatic effect keeping it there

747.12 --> 751.76
somehow or some

748.399 --> 754.959
certain elements and then yeah

751.76 --> 757.68
i could actually sort of imagine how

754.959 --> 758.079
maybe helium there could transform in

757.68 --> 761.68
that

758.079 --> 764.7199999999999
height and then start almost like

761.68 --> 766.2399999999999
four meteor belts but not heliocentric

764.72 --> 768.399
meteor belts and then

766.24 --> 770.48
eventually if the rock becomes too big

768.399 --> 771.519
that the electrostatics can't hold on to

770.48 --> 774.48
it anymore

771.519 --> 774.48
it drops down

785.279 --> 791.279
yeah that i don't know

789.36 --> 794.72
if i visualize that that actually

791.279 --> 794.72
halfway makes sense to me

796.639 --> 802.0790000000001
anyways it's good to keep this mind

800.56 --> 805.1199999999999
experiment

802.079 --> 807.92
in mind just let it sink see what what

805.12 --> 807.92
else comes up

808.48 --> 811.9200000000001
that could maybe tie into something like

810.88 --> 814.399
this you know

811.92 --> 816.16
hey at least i got some kind of freaking

814.399 --> 818.8
explanation then other than

816.16 --> 820.639
oh there's a piece dropped like breaking

818.8 --> 822.399
off the dome

820.639 --> 824.399
and falling down you know that because

822.399 --> 826.56
that's just

824.399 --> 828.48
that seems absolutely ridiculous to me

826.56 --> 831.279
that means that the design is literally

828.48 --> 831.279
breaking apart

831.6 --> 838.24
or on the other hand maybe

835.199 --> 841.68
the helium touches the dome

838.24 --> 842.399
or whatever then there the fusion

841.68 --> 845.5999999999999
happens

842.399 --> 849.04
maybe literally helium just gets fused

845.6 --> 851.0400000000001
to the dome and then this meteoric crust

849.04 --> 852.959
forms and then it drops off

851.04 --> 854.48
i don't know it's it's almost the same

852.959 --> 856.16
like that except yeah

854.48 --> 859.44
i'm assuming that it would literally

856.16 --> 862.56
start to build up a crust against

859.44 --> 862.5600000000001
the end of the container

863.68 --> 868.88
it makes more sense than its literal

865.92 --> 870.56
fragments of the designed original dome

868.88 --> 875.4399999999999
structure falling down because that

870.56 --> 875.4399999999999
makes no damn sense to me whatsoever

877.279 --> 880.56
right kevin horizons that's exactly what

880.079 --> 882.959
i'm

880.56 --> 884.16
presupposing with this with this minor

882.959 --> 889.1199999999999
experiment

884.16 --> 889.12
it might be a similar type of process

889.92 --> 894.24
but instead of a hydrological cycle

892.48 --> 898.5600000000001
where that is how it works

894.24 --> 902.0
this would be a helium meteorolo

898.56 --> 905.4399999999999
meteoric cycle taking place

902.0 --> 905.76
way higher up way out of sight way out

905.44 --> 908.8800000000001
of

905.76 --> 912.079
our visual limit range

908.88 --> 914.0
even in balloons and [ __ ] like i can't

912.079 --> 915.92
imagine that in the balloon you'd

914.0 --> 917.76
who knows maybe there is no light that

915.92 --> 919.199
ever hits there so there's nothing to

917.76 --> 921.519
see

919.199 --> 924.0
and no light we have can actually reach

921.519 --> 926.32
far enough to

924.0 --> 927.199
to make such make things up there

926.32 --> 930.0790000000001
visible you know

927.199 --> 930.56
something like that because all the the

930.079 --> 932.4799999999999
the

930.56 --> 933.5999999999999
luminary light seems to be directed

932.48 --> 936.8000000000001
downward

933.6 --> 938.32
right so downward projected downward

936.8 --> 940.7199999999999
manifest

938.32 --> 941.519
it's not a ball hanging there shining in

940.72 --> 943.6
all directions

941.519 --> 944.9590000000001
including against the dome or we'd see a

943.6 --> 947.44
lot more

944.959 --> 949.1199999999999
more physical things and [ __ ] it's not

947.44 --> 950.759
happening like that

949.12 --> 953.199
so it's likely that whatever

950.759 --> 954.16
transmutative processes are taking place

953.199 --> 957.68
there

954.16 --> 957.68
it's it's not visible

963.92 --> 967.5999999999999
scrapes helium off the container to read

966.48 --> 971.279
no

967.6 --> 972.24
oh that's ridiculous that's that's too

971.279 --> 975.519
far man

972.24 --> 976.48
and besides if it's transmutated there

975.519 --> 983.839
into this

976.48 --> 983.839
meteoric metal it's no longer helium

984.72 --> 988.1600000000001
you know and i don't know maybe i i

987.839 --> 992.0790000000001
think

988.16 --> 995.199
helium can be made

992.079 --> 996.399
chemically out of other materials i'm

995.199 --> 998.4799999999999
not 100

996.399 --> 1000.399
sure though but it should be there's not

998.48 --> 1002.639
just pockets of helium

1000.399 --> 1005.199
everywhere and then because then it

1002.639 --> 1007.519
would always be escaping

1005.199 --> 1009.8389999999999
so i think there is just a chemical

1007.519 --> 1012.57
cycle added

1009.839 --> 1014.0
helium gets

1012.57 --> 1016.48
[Music]

1014.0 --> 1018.32
chemically created out of materials then

1016.48 --> 1020.399
it escapes then it goes way up

1018.32 --> 1022.32
there it transmutates into metal and

1020.399 --> 1026.48
then it goes down again

1022.32 --> 1030.959
and eventually more helium will be

1026.48 --> 1034.959
extracted chemically made or

1030.959 --> 1038.24
down there right sounds legit

1034.959 --> 1041.039
sort of like stalagmites yeah

1038.24 --> 1042.64
sort of maybe maybe that or maybe not

1041.039 --> 1045.12
like that

1042.64 --> 1047.3600000000001
because stalagmites of course are formed

1045.12 --> 1049.6789999999999
because there's literal water dripping

1047.36 --> 1051.12
and the water is taking extra minerals

1049.679 --> 1052.799
with it that stick

1051.12 --> 1054.6399999999999
that it leaves behind us the water

1052.799 --> 1056.72
droplet falls

1054.64 --> 1058.64
or parts of it and takes some with it

1056.72 --> 1061.3600000000001
and that's how stalagmites form where it

1058.64 --> 1063.5200000000002
hits the bottom

1061.36 --> 1064.9599999999998
but yeah it's because of the water

1063.52 --> 1067.52
sticking together the

1064.96 --> 1068.96
surface tension of the water droplets

1067.52 --> 1072.0
that it then

1068.96 --> 1075.28
over the edges forms into spikes

1072.0 --> 1077.039
well there's no absolutely no indication

1075.28 --> 1082.16
that water has anything to do

1077.039 --> 1085.039
with the helium meteorite potential

1082.16 --> 1087.1200000000001
reaction so there's no no reason to

1085.039 --> 1089.36
assume that it's all forming spikes up

1087.12 --> 1089.36
there

1090.08 --> 1096.559
but who knows you know we'd have to have

1093.679 --> 1098.5590000000002
some kind of visual of that

1096.559 --> 1102.0
and hey this is just one option you know

1098.559 --> 1102.0
the sticking to the ceiling

1102.16 --> 1105.919
i don't really yeah i literally don't

1104.24 --> 1108.96
see it

1105.919 --> 1110.64
it's imaginable but yeah brings many

1108.96 --> 1111.52
complications that there's just no

1110.64 --> 1113.679
indication

1111.52 --> 1114.8799999999999
of and hey it doesn't happen with water

1113.679 --> 1117.44
either you know those

1114.88 --> 1118.48
it is not ice sticking to a dome and

1117.44 --> 1121.76
then breaking off

1118.48 --> 1124.72
no no no it's literally going around

1121.76 --> 1126.0
and then forming so i think it's more

1124.72 --> 1129.919
likely that any

1126.0 --> 1131.6
meteoric cycle with helium or anything

1129.919 --> 1133.5200000000002
that it would happen similarly that it

1131.6 --> 1134.08
would literally just move around in a

1133.52 --> 1137.44
cloud

1134.08 --> 1140.3999999999999
their form and then come down

1137.44 --> 1142.64
not stick to any ceiling but who knows

1140.4 --> 1142.64
you know

1146.64 --> 1155.8400000000001
lillian turns liquid when cold yeah

1151.36 --> 1157.76
but that yeah it it doesn't just do that

1155.84 --> 1159.28
though it doesn't just turn liquid

1157.76 --> 1162.799
because it's cold

1159.28 --> 1164.24
because it also has to be pressurized or

1162.799 --> 1166.16
it's just not gonna

1164.24 --> 1168.4
turn liquid it's not gonna just turn

1166.16 --> 1179.8400000000001
liquid and then have a vacuum right next

1168.4 --> 1179.8400000000001
to it that doesn't happen

1180.53 --> 1183.579
[Music]

1186.88 --> 1193.8400000000001
uh what

1196.0 --> 1200.88
you gave it 10 seconds and forms your

1197.919 --> 1204.64
opinion without looking into it

1200.88 --> 1204.64
what is there to research about it

1205.36 --> 1208.6399999999999
what we're going to look into other

1206.96 --> 1211.6000000000001
people's raw

1208.64 --> 1211.6000000000001
ideas about it

1211.76 --> 1215.2
how is that research what have other

1214.72 --> 1217.44
people

1215.2 --> 1218.96
thought up about it i don't know do i

1217.44 --> 1222.24
really need

1218.96 --> 1223.44
to go there you know any research that

1222.24 --> 1227.44
would be real with it

1223.44 --> 1227.44
yeah empiricism you know

1227.52 --> 1232.96
so why why why is that a problem

1233.76 --> 1239.52
give an opinion formed in 10 seconds why

1236.799 --> 1239.52
is that a problem

1242.32 --> 1249.12
the concept is interesting yeah i agree

1246.08 --> 1251.4399999999998
that's why i brought it up but again the

1249.12 --> 1253.1999999999998
idea that some yeah meteorites are

1251.44 --> 1253.8400000000001
breaking off the dome which is the

1253.2 --> 1256.72
oldest

1253.84 --> 1258.6399999999999
idea going around from the flat earthers

1256.72 --> 1263.84
about it

1258.64 --> 1263.8400000000001
i i just don't see it i really don't

1270.32 --> 1276.3999999999999
literally i don't see it there's

1272.559 --> 1280.08
something sticking to a dome then

1276.4 --> 1283.2800000000002
there should be a yeah

1280.08 --> 1286.1589999999999
signs there should be some kind of

1283.28 --> 1286.48
thing in order to detect or whatever you

1286.159 --> 1290.4
know

1286.48 --> 1292.64
and it's not

1290.4 --> 1294.5590000000002
i may form my opinions quick yeah that's

1292.64 --> 1298.72
right instantly

1294.559 --> 1301.6
yes i do ideas also form the same way

1298.72 --> 1303.52
just bang i hear something bang there

1301.6 --> 1306.24
you go entire crystal and i spend

1303.52 --> 1307.28
over hours sometimes sometimes only a

1306.24 --> 1310.24
few minutes

1307.28 --> 1313.039
putting it down yeah that's how it works

1310.24 --> 1319.84
the actual there forms instantly

1313.039 --> 1319.84
just like that

1326.72 --> 1329.679
hey julia pam

1329.84 --> 1337.12
yeah thank you kevin horizons

1333.2 --> 1339.28
it yeah it look at some points you know

1337.12 --> 1340.8799999999999
it would be good to just figure out what

1339.28 --> 1343.28
these meteorites are because

1340.88 --> 1343.919
they're not a fictional phenomena in the

1343.28 --> 1345.52
sense that

1343.919 --> 1347.1200000000001
yeah there seem to be these metallic

1345.52 --> 1350.32
rocks coming down

1347.12 --> 1354.2399999999998
seem to or it has been like the

1350.32 --> 1356.08
one of the biggest scams ever

1354.24 --> 1357.52
it just seems unlikely you know there

1356.08 --> 1361.84
are visuals of

1357.52 --> 1361.84
well what seem like meteorites

1362.88 --> 1366.24
that not just falling star light

1365.2 --> 1368.4
phenomena but

1366.24 --> 1369.52
real physical things with burning up and

1368.4 --> 1372.72
smoke and

1369.52 --> 1375.84
yeah so if that is there why

1372.72 --> 1375.84
what is it

1380.48 --> 1385.44
right so i'm just in general more

1382.96 --> 1388.64
interested in trying to figure out a

1385.44 --> 1390.96
logical natural cycle that would create

1388.64 --> 1393.2800000000002
it as a natural phenomena as part of the

1390.96 --> 1393.28
realm

1393.919 --> 1399.76
then to start to imagine that it has

1397.2 --> 1401.039
all been a hoax and that literally that

1399.76 --> 1404.1589999999999
is a pure

1401.039 --> 1405.36
natural crisis act as it were that no

1404.159 --> 1408.72
rock ever fell

1405.36 --> 1412.0
ever this that's just too far

1408.72 --> 1412.799
it's too much you know even if it were

1412.0 --> 1416.4
true it's

1412.799 --> 1419.84
it's too much you'd have to have some

1416.4 --> 1420.24
serious proof for such a thing and even

1419.84 --> 1422.0
if

1420.24 --> 1424.24
that would there be out there it would

1422.0 --> 1427.2
be so mind-breaking

1424.24 --> 1429.2
like like seriously if whoever you know

1427.2 --> 1432.159
freemason group or whatever

1429.2 --> 1434.0800000000002
the pope who whoever just comes out you

1432.159 --> 1436.72
have meteorites we actually did

1434.08 --> 1437.1999999999998
that as to reinforce heliocentrism or

1436.72 --> 1439.2
something

1437.2 --> 1441.6000000000001
because there are no meteorites you

1439.2 --> 1445.1200000000001
think anyone in the freaking world is

1441.6 --> 1448.7199999999998
actually going to believe that

1445.12 --> 1448.7199999999998
no way they're going to be like

1449.2 --> 1457.039
no that's no way no way

1452.72 --> 1459.84
no no no no it has to be something

1457.039 --> 1459.84
right

1466.48 --> 1469.76
so yeah i'm just trying to work on what

1468.96 --> 1471.6000000000001
is it

1469.76 --> 1473.76
what is it really assuming that it is

1471.6 --> 1476.7199999999998
real that there are really metallic

1473.76 --> 1476.72
rocks falling down

1479.6 --> 1484.0
yeah drew ling perf yeah but the thing

1483.039 --> 1486.799
is

1484.0 --> 1489.039
that's much easier you know everybody

1486.799 --> 1489.52
can look around everybody can see very

1489.039 --> 1491.76
far

1489.52 --> 1493.279
at times during their life if they pay

1491.76 --> 1494.72
attention and

1493.279 --> 1496.88
basically think about what they're

1494.72 --> 1498.48
looking at that's the difference but

1496.88 --> 1502.64
it's very rare that people

1498.48 --> 1506.159
actually in person get to see meteorites

1502.64 --> 1508.96
other than just falling stars just as

1506.159 --> 1509.44
a light which a lot of people see all

1508.96 --> 1511.3600000000001
the time

1509.44 --> 1513.8400000000001
but there's no proof of any proximity

1511.36 --> 1516.08
with any of that

1513.84 --> 1518.0
actual meteorites that leave smoke and

1516.08 --> 1520.1589999999999
all that visually

1518.0 --> 1523.12
that's very rare for people to encounter

1520.159 --> 1523.1200000000001
that in their lifetime

1523.2 --> 1526.159
i don't know maybe unless you live in

1524.799 --> 1528.32
russia or something apparently it

1526.159 --> 1530.5590000000002
happens a lot there

1528.32 --> 1533.84
or at least there's a lot of desk cam

1530.559 --> 1533.84
footage of that sort of thing

1535.36 --> 1542.4799999999998
or maybe that was just that recent one

1539.44 --> 1544.96
a very impressive one like this big one

1542.48 --> 1547.679
exploding right over a city that was

1544.96 --> 1547.679
pretty freaky

1550.48 --> 1557.84
is that the one

1560.72 --> 1563.6000000000001
i'm what

1564.48 --> 1571.84
secrets of the moon of god

1576.0 --> 1579.6
how would you know if you found a

1577.76 --> 1582.0
meteorite

1579.6 --> 1584.08
how would you know it's from some other

1582.0 --> 1586.64
place well you can do

1584.08 --> 1587.279
a lot of research on it other than

1586.64 --> 1589.44
things

1587.279 --> 1590.559
just like carbon dating ryan's logic i

1589.44 --> 1592.559
happen to know about it as a

1590.559 --> 1595.279
metallurgist

1592.559 --> 1596.48
right very interested in that sort of

1595.279 --> 1600.08
thing so

1596.48 --> 1603.52
meteorites have unique metallic

1600.08 --> 1605.1999999999998
components that do not you can't find

1603.52 --> 1607.279
that when digging up

1605.2 --> 1609.679
now it has come to my attention that

1607.279 --> 1613.919
it's probably

1609.679 --> 1616.799
doable to artificially make them using

1613.919 --> 1618.0800000000002
technology using induction and then

1616.799 --> 1621.52
literally

1618.08 --> 1623.6
somehow getting it together but if that

1621.52 --> 1625.44
is a possibility then it's a well-kept

1623.6 --> 1627.36
secret

1625.44 --> 1628.559
and i have a suspicion that that there

1627.36 --> 1632.24
might be someone

1628.559 --> 1635.52
i used to know that can do that

1632.24 --> 1637.84
who also made yeah my dagger among

1635.52 --> 1637.84
others

1638.84 --> 1643.52
but yeah what he taught me about

1642.399 --> 1645.76
meteorites

1643.52 --> 1646.8799999999999
and he supposedly worked with them

1645.76 --> 1650.32
actually turning them

1646.88 --> 1652.48
meteorites into swords what he told me

1650.32 --> 1654.799
was that there's something really unique

1652.48 --> 1656.3990000000001
about certain meteorites that are just

1654.799 --> 1659.76
not found naturally and that's how you

1656.399 --> 1662.8799999999999
recognize it must be real meteorite

1659.76 --> 1669.84
right and that is that it has a

1662.88 --> 1669.8400000000001
what is it again nickel cadmium

1670.48 --> 1674.72
and you can't find that in nature those

1672.64 --> 1676.3990000000001
two do not

1674.72 --> 1677.84
you can't find those two together

1676.399 --> 1681.6789999999999
apparently

1677.84 --> 1685.6789999999999
that's what i learned nickel

1681.679 --> 1689.76
neck cadmium and that happens to be

1685.679 --> 1691.6000000000001
an extremely hard and light combination

1689.76 --> 1692.799
very light weighted compared to the

1691.6 --> 1695.4399999999998
strength it has it's

1692.799 --> 1696.1589999999999
it's funny because then that that

1695.44 --> 1699.3600000000001
combination

1696.159 --> 1702.88
of metal is what kind of inspired the

1699.36 --> 1702.8799999999999
idea of adamantium

1703.44 --> 1708.0
really because it is super strong

1708.96 --> 1711.8400000000001
and not brittle

1713.919 --> 1716.64
it's interesting

1721.84 --> 1729.279
so there you go like i have

1725.919 --> 1731.2
i have interest in like

1729.279 --> 1734.32
personal interest in knowing what

1731.2 --> 1736.799
meteorites really are

1734.32 --> 1738.48
i want to know if it was a a hoax from

1736.799 --> 1742.08
the get-go that's just

1738.48 --> 1745.6
that's lasted incredibly long

1742.08 --> 1748.1589999999999
or that it really is a

1745.6 --> 1749.1999999999998
natural part of a natural cycle within

1748.159 --> 1753.8400000000001
the realm

1749.2 --> 1753.8400000000001
i want to know

1756.96 --> 1767.76
i got a lot of people in chat now good

1758.799 --> 1772.399
to see you all

1767.76 --> 1781.84
easy to make heat fused elements

1772.399 --> 1781.84
uh no no it's not

1782.64 --> 1788.0800000000002
that's that's very interesting that you

1786.08 --> 1792.0
would think that kevin horizon's but i

1788.08 --> 1792.0
don't think you're a blacksmith or a

1792.84 --> 1795.84
metallurgist

1798.32 --> 1802.799
so no it's not

1802.96 --> 1809.8400000000001
it's not easy to fuse at all

1815.039 --> 1823.84
all right

1828.48 --> 1832.48
yeah oh brian's logic that's that's a

1830.64 --> 1835.679
decent question how do you establish

1832.48 --> 1839.279
that all elements are not from earth

1835.679 --> 1841.6000000000001
well how they do it is not from earth

1839.279 --> 1843.76
that's basically the heliocentric spin

1841.6 --> 1847.52
but what it comes down to

1843.76 --> 1850.799
not to be found naturally on earth

1847.52 --> 1854.1589999999999
so you won't be able to

1850.799 --> 1858.1589999999999
dig into a mountain somewhere

1854.159 --> 1861.279
and then find the nickel cadmium

1858.159 --> 1864.0800000000002
blended in like that that's what

1861.279 --> 1865.279
they say not found on earth that's what

1864.08 --> 1867.519
they base that on

1865.279 --> 1870.48
that it it will not be found together in

1867.519 --> 1870.48
a mountain somewhere

1876.84 --> 1879.84
see

1882.64 --> 1886.5590000000002
ah yeah i'm definitely gonna title this

1884.88 --> 1889.3600000000001
show after the meteorites

1886.559 --> 1890.32
it's been very good i didn't even set

1889.36 --> 1893.36
out to

1890.32 --> 1896.72
start talking about this but it

1893.36 --> 1896.7199999999998
it just lingered in there

1903.6 --> 1909.84
well zapped happy i address that

1907.039 --> 1911.6
yes seems very unlikely although i've

1909.84 --> 1913.76
also conceived that there might be a

1911.6 --> 1917.4399999999998
possibility that

1913.76 --> 1919.519
it's not literally pieces of the dome

1917.44 --> 1920.559
structure that is the container of the

1919.519 --> 1923.76
realm itself

1920.559 --> 1923.76
but that it might be

1924.0 --> 1931.2
fusing onto the dome

1927.84 --> 1933.76
like sediment it might be

1931.2 --> 1935.6000000000001
literally forming against the dome by

1933.76 --> 1937.44
some extreme electrical process or

1935.6 --> 1939.519
something and then

1937.44 --> 1941.8400000000001
eventually getting brick brittle getting

1939.519 --> 1945.84
weight and then

1941.84 --> 1948.0
that excretion the the metallic

1945.84 --> 1950.08
sediment then breaking off and falling

1948.0 --> 1952.88
down i i can't completely

1950.08 --> 1954.399
exclude it it just seems less likely

1952.88 --> 1958.48
than it is

1954.399 --> 1961.6
then to imagine that it would be rather

1958.48 --> 1965.1200000000001
like the hydrological cycle it would be

1961.6 --> 1966.559
forming inside of some kind of

1965.12 --> 1968.1589999999999
turbulence

1966.559 --> 1970.799
and then when it gets enough weight

1968.159 --> 1973.0390000000002
suddenly it starts to fall down

1970.799 --> 1976.6399999999999
and because electrostatics are keeping

1973.039 --> 1978.96
it kind of in place

1976.64 --> 1981.1200000000001
but hey i can't perfectly i cannot

1978.96 --> 1982.24
absolutely exclude that it is some kind

1981.12 --> 1985.6
of

1982.24 --> 1989.24
secretion or that was it a

1985.6 --> 1992.0
sediment metallic sediment that

1989.24 --> 1993.679
transmutates and forms and sticks

1992.0 --> 1995.279
against the dome and then eventually

1993.679 --> 1997.679
breaks off but it would not be

1995.279 --> 1999.44
literal pieces of the dome of the actual

1997.679 --> 2001.44
architecture itself because that's just

1999.44 --> 2005.8400000000001
a ridiculous notion to me

2001.44 --> 2005.8400000000001
absolutely ridiculous

2008.64 --> 2012.0800000000002
that's one of the dumbest thing i've

2010.96 --> 2016.96
ever heard you say is that

2012.08 --> 2020.1589999999999
heavy it's absolutely ridiculous

2016.96 --> 2023.76
that's not how i suggest at all it works

2020.159 --> 2027.3600000000001
at all there's no metal from the earth

2023.76 --> 2028.24
shooting up unless it's being catapulted

2027.36 --> 2032.32
and it's all been

2028.24 --> 2033.919
a giant 500 year old prank about the

2032.32 --> 2037.039
meteorites

2033.919 --> 2040.0
but that seems very unlikely as well

2037.039 --> 2040.8799999999999
now what i suggested is that helium

2040.0 --> 2043.12
since it is

2040.88 --> 2044.0
being created it is forming it is

2043.12 --> 2046.1589999999999
escaping

2044.0 --> 2047.76
it's going to go up it's not gonna come

2046.159 --> 2049.2000000000003
down go boom boom because that's not

2047.76 --> 2051.599
what gas does

2049.2 --> 2053.04
so why isn't the entire realm filled

2051.599 --> 2055.52
with helium only

2053.04 --> 2057.599
well because it's it's changing into

2055.52 --> 2060.639
something else it has to

2057.599 --> 2063.679
so then i thought okay maybe it's helium

2060.639 --> 2066.639
that's somehow transmutating into

2063.679 --> 2067.44
meteorites up there it's transmutating

2066.639 --> 2069.76
into metal

2067.44 --> 2071.76
and then if that would happen yeah then

2069.76 --> 2073.119
suddenly it would gain enough density to

2071.76 --> 2075.28
go down again

2073.119 --> 2076.159
because in its helium state that it's

2075.28 --> 2079.0400000000004
not going to do that

2076.159 --> 2081.839
there's no way see so that's what kind

2079.04 --> 2084.879
of sparked this

2081.839 --> 2089.119
this concept of a cycle or

2084.879 --> 2092.399
as i call it a helium meteoric

2089.119 --> 2095.679
cycle yeah

2092.399 --> 2095.679
i'm gonna name my hangout that

2099.76 --> 2117.8390000000004
the meteoric helium

2104.079 --> 2117.8390000000004
cycle that's a good name

2119.68 --> 2123.1189999999997
yes you would sept happy

2124.32 --> 2131.839
you're sloppy you're a slacker

2137.28 --> 2140.5600000000004
can helium go metallic well i'm not

2140.0 --> 2143.599
saying

2140.56 --> 2145.44
through chemical reactions ryan's i

2143.599 --> 2147.3590000000004
specifically stated that it would

2145.44 --> 2149.359
have to be some kind of electrical

2147.359 --> 2152.56
transmutation effect

2149.359 --> 2155.44
but otherwise you know it's like this

2152.56 --> 2156.4
the helium has to change into something

2155.44 --> 2158.96
else

2156.4 --> 2159.52
or the entire realm is going to be

2158.96 --> 2162.88
filled

2159.52 --> 2164.56
with helium it's it would build up over

2162.88 --> 2167.92
the ages it wouldn't go away

2164.56 --> 2170.64
so there must be something

2167.92 --> 2172.56
that the helium is changing into that is

2170.64 --> 2174.8799999999997
not helium

2172.56 --> 2176.64
and then i thought okay well if these

2174.88 --> 2179.28
mysterious metallic

2176.64 --> 2181.04
things are coming down well maybe that

2179.28 --> 2182.7200000000003
is the other end of the cycle

2181.04 --> 2184.8
maybe that is the way the helium comes

2182.72 --> 2188.9599999999996
down eventually

2184.8 --> 2188.96
by being transmutated into meteor

2190.88 --> 2195.76
yeah but the sun is not an object

2192.96 --> 2195.76
brian's logic

2196.48 --> 2201.839
and besides helium does not

2199.599 --> 2201.839
burn

2204.4 --> 2208.7200000000003
but i've also suggested that maybe these

2206.88 --> 2212.2400000000002
daylights influence and

2208.72 --> 2215.68
the electrical influence that i presume

2212.24 --> 2217.9199999999996
is causing the sun light apparition

2215.68 --> 2219.44
and all the energy that comes from that

2217.92 --> 2221.839
maybe that same energy

2219.44 --> 2223.76
is also the thing that is transmutating

2221.839 --> 2229.839
helium

2223.76 --> 2229.8390000000004
could be

2232.32 --> 2236.56
there has to be some kind of influence

2234.4 --> 2239.04
that would transmutate it

2236.56 --> 2240.24
you know it helium doesn't just

2239.04 --> 2242.24
naturally or

2240.24 --> 2243.359
through basic chemical reactions turn

2242.24 --> 2247.2
into something else

2243.359 --> 2248.7999999999997
it's a noble gas so it has to be some

2247.2 --> 2251.68
kind of fusion process

2248.8 --> 2252.88
and the only way that i know that could

2251.68 --> 2257.839
do that potentially

2252.88 --> 2257.839
is extreme electricity

2269.68 --> 2275.1189999999997
yeah oh brian's logic that's really nice

2272.72 --> 2278.3199999999997
words and all that

2275.119 --> 2278.32
but yeah

2279.44 --> 2282.88
that doesn't mean anything just because

2282.24 --> 2285.9199999999996
the sun

2282.88 --> 2287.28
is healing is helios it literally does

2285.92 --> 2289.28
not mean a thing

2287.28 --> 2291.6800000000003
i'm pretty sure that the conception and

2289.28 --> 2294.7200000000003
the naming of the sun and the gods was

2291.68 --> 2298.56
way before chemistry all right

2294.72 --> 2300.0
this is way before that pretty damn sure

2298.56 --> 2304.4
that even during

2300.0 --> 2307.839
pre-chem chemistry era was it again

2304.4 --> 2308.96
alchemy they didn't know what the freak

2307.839 --> 2312.4
helium was

2308.96 --> 2314.32
they didn't call it helium

2312.4 --> 2315.44
or maybe they did maybe it's like oh

2314.32 --> 2317.3590000000004
this is the gas

2315.44 --> 2320.4
that you can make and it doesn't burn

2317.359 --> 2320.4
let's call it helium

2322.88 --> 2330.8
right yeah so the name was derived

2326.4 --> 2334.2400000000002
from a deity idea that doesn't mean

2330.8 --> 2336.8
anything it doesn't mean that it is

2334.24 --> 2338.3999999999996
part of the sun that there is some kind

2336.8 --> 2340.5600000000004
of direct cycle there

2338.4 --> 2355.839
it doesn't mean that at all it just

2340.56 --> 2355.839
means it's the name they picked

2357.92 --> 2361.13
[Music]

2370.72 --> 2374.56
why did they pick it well why don't you

2373.119 --> 2376.8
go look up and

2374.56 --> 2377.7599999999998
see why they picked it what kind of

2376.8 --> 2380.48
question is that

2377.76 --> 2382.5600000000004
they picked it because they picked it

2380.48 --> 2385.92
and they thought yeah that makes sense

2382.56 --> 2385.92
it's helium it's

2386.88 --> 2390.7200000000003
it goes up the highest so look people

2390.16 --> 2393.2799999999997
like that

2390.72 --> 2394.64
always think in tears so if helium is

2393.28 --> 2396.4
one of the lightest gas

2394.64 --> 2398.0
it's non-reactive it goes up well what

2396.4 --> 2401.52
is the highest indeed the

2398.0 --> 2405.359
hierarchy of all things in matter helios

2401.52 --> 2407.119
right so yeah they pick it because it's

2405.359 --> 2408.88
like yeah it's the thing that floats to

2407.119 --> 2412.1600000000003
the top helios

2408.88 --> 2413.839
seems very logical not

2412.16 --> 2416.96
super well thought through it's just

2413.839 --> 2416.96
systematic thinking

2420.64 --> 2426.16
right so if it doesn't tell then you

2423.359 --> 2428.16
should draw a conclusion

2426.16 --> 2429.5989999999997
because it doesn't tell then it means

2428.16 --> 2432.72
there is no

2429.599 --> 2433.92
there's no historical reason for it it's

2432.72 --> 2436.9599999999996
just

2433.92 --> 2439.6800000000003
basic approach what goes up to the top

2436.96 --> 2440.16
okay well what's at the top of the deity

2439.68 --> 2443.2799999999997
scale

2440.16 --> 2445.2799999999997
whatever helios so yeah helium there you

2443.28 --> 2447.3590000000004
go

2445.28 --> 2449.8390000000004
they probably had they would have picked

2447.359 --> 2453.52
hydrogen for the name helium

2449.839 --> 2456.48
if hydrogen did not have such a

2453.52 --> 2458.8
big influence that it is part of water

2456.48 --> 2461.52
you know

2458.8 --> 2463.52
yeah otherwise they would have probably

2461.52 --> 2467.839
called hydrogen helium

2463.52 --> 2467.839
because it is even lighter

2468.079 --> 2472.2400000000002
right so there you go it's arbitrary

2471.599 --> 2473.839
pick

2472.24 --> 2476.56
it's like okay what are we gonna call

2473.839 --> 2478.96
this guys in laboratories that are

2476.56 --> 2480.7999999999997
making a foundation for a systematic

2478.96 --> 2483.359
chemistry

2480.8 --> 2485.3590000000004
okay we're just picking this one

2483.359 --> 2487.92
sticking to that picking that one

2485.359 --> 2488.88
people complain about it and they don't

2487.92 --> 2491.76
care they just now

2488.88 --> 2494.56
we pick this this is what it's called

2491.76 --> 2497.6800000000003
there you go

2494.56 --> 2499.119
it's not like there's like deities

2497.68 --> 2502.319
standing around them

2499.119 --> 2505.44
this is what thou shalt name this

2502.319 --> 2508.0
element that's not happening

2505.44 --> 2508.7200000000003
okay it's not happening they don't do

2508.0 --> 2523.839
that

2508.72 --> 2523.839
it's just people picking names

2540.6 --> 2543.719
[Music]

2550.16 --> 2556.56
uh yeah and then

2553.359 --> 2559.5989999999997
transmutation is not middle ages fantasy

2556.56 --> 2559.599
thank you very much

2561.24 --> 2566.64
disprovable and repeatable fact

2564.56 --> 2567.92
there's things in chemistry that don't

2566.64 --> 2570.96
work out

2567.92 --> 2571.88
although in the bigger lines it does but

2570.96 --> 2575.92
there's just

2571.88 --> 2579.6800000000003
inconsistencies that have no explanation

2575.92 --> 2580.0
and the explanation that is left to us

2579.68 --> 2582.24
is

2580.0 --> 2584.48
transmutation there's other processes

2582.24 --> 2587.9199999999996
than chemistry going on

2584.48 --> 2587.92
and transmutation is it

2588.88 --> 2592.6400000000003
so transmutation is simply another

2591.52 --> 2595.68
classification

2592.64 --> 2598.24
another process type that matter

2595.68 --> 2600.72
can also be subjected to that's it it's

2598.24 --> 2604.3999999999996
not medieval fantasy

2600.72 --> 2607.68
an alchemy is just a earlier

2604.4 --> 2609.839
version of chemistry that's it

2607.68 --> 2613.2799999999997
it's not medieval fantasy either it's

2609.839 --> 2616.319
just not as well worked out

2613.28 --> 2618.079
and it has other roots

2616.319 --> 2620.0
you know the people that were doing that

2618.079 --> 2623.119
had religions on their mind

2620.0 --> 2624.88
a little of their own sort so yeah it's

2623.119 --> 2625.44
the old influences but it doesn't mean

2624.88 --> 2635.839
it's all

2625.44 --> 2635.839
fantasy it's just it's a mixed thing

2636.48 --> 2643.92
you know you shouldn't poo poo stuff

2640.16 --> 2647.2799999999997
happening in the far past any of it

2643.92 --> 2648.88
can be damn well sure that most

2647.28 --> 2651.119
things that happened in the past

2648.88 --> 2654.96
especially the extreme things happen

2651.119 --> 2659.04
for a reason a reason that is forgotten

2654.96 --> 2659.04
a reason that is no longer understood

2659.839 --> 2663.2799999999997
but those those things don't happen

2662.0 --> 2666.48
without reason

2663.28 --> 2669.2000000000003
it's just that over the ages the details

2666.48 --> 2672.16
of the reasons why people and groups do

2669.2 --> 2674.319
things kind of weather off they get

2672.16 --> 2676.0789999999997
become forgotten so then you just

2674.319 --> 2678.8
look at it from a more primitive

2676.079 --> 2682.319
standpoint and say oh they were so

2678.8 --> 2683.8390000000004
barbaric or this and that they because

2682.319 --> 2685.599
you can't conceive anymore that they

2683.839 --> 2688.56
might actually have had a very good

2685.599 --> 2688.56
reason to do that

2688.839 --> 2695.92
right and that even goes

2691.76 --> 2695.92
up to not even 100 years ago

2699.119 --> 2705.839
because it's yeah it's very common place

2702.8 --> 2709.119
for government and society to pooh-pooh

2705.839 --> 2710.88
the past to suggest that it's all better

2709.119 --> 2714.319
now all much more advanced much

2710.88 --> 2716.839
wiser much more spiritually advanced

2714.319 --> 2718.8
closer to god than it used to be oh

2716.839 --> 2721.119
really

2718.8 --> 2722.48
well when you take a look at the

2721.119 --> 2724.319
individuals

2722.48 --> 2727.28
and then study them and then compare

2724.319 --> 2729.44
them to individuals in the past

2727.28 --> 2730.8390000000004
that turns out absolutely to be the

2729.44 --> 2734.319
reversed case

2730.839 --> 2738.56
so yeah should learn from that

2734.319 --> 2738.56
don't poo poo things in the past

2739.52 --> 2743.599
it's very likely you just don't have the

2741.52 --> 2744.8
full picture or you're misinterpreting

2743.599 --> 2747.52
it

2744.8 --> 2749.52
you're just assuming that people do

2747.52 --> 2750.4
things and even extreme things for no

2749.52 --> 2753.52
damn reason

2750.4 --> 2754.7200000000003
they don't they never do that unless

2753.52 --> 2758.16
they're literally just

2754.72 --> 2760.319
losing their minds because

2758.16 --> 2761.92
that is happening because they're being

2760.319 --> 2764.319
poisoned

2761.92 --> 2765.92
they didn't know it yet or they're being

2764.319 --> 2770.079
mind controlled

2765.92 --> 2772.16
and driven to suicidal situations

2770.079 --> 2774.48
because if you think that like the blm

2772.16 --> 2776.0789999999997
[ __ ] happening right now

2774.48 --> 2779.04
like that's the first time that happens

2776.079 --> 2783.119
in history think again

2779.04 --> 2789.839
think again yeah

2783.119 --> 2789.839
that [ __ ] has happened a lot

2794.56 --> 2803.839
okay september whatever i don't know

2798.24 --> 2803.839
just never heard of that

2807.599 --> 2814.6400000000003
now mn that's not the case

2811.44 --> 2817.76
it's not as simple it's ridic

2814.64 --> 2820.72
like this comes this notion that

2817.76 --> 2821.44
only now only thanks to computers and

2820.72 --> 2823.9199999999996
all that

2821.44 --> 2824.8
that we can gather all this data that's

2823.92 --> 2827.52
absolutely

2824.8 --> 2827.52
[ __ ]

2828.4 --> 2835.6800000000003
you know people had elaborate

2832.4 --> 2839.92
star charts celestial

2835.68 --> 2843.04
charts maps thousands

2839.92 --> 2843.599
of years ago you really think that back

2843.04 --> 2846.0
then

2843.599 --> 2847.839
they were just all only wasting their

2846.0 --> 2851.119
time everyone

2847.839 --> 2853.92
no way you think that this

2851.119 --> 2854.52
is unique that we're now only getting

2853.92 --> 2858.0
all this

2854.52 --> 2862.319
[ __ ] [ __ ]

2858.0 --> 2862.319
absolute horse [ __ ]

2871.119 --> 2874.96
and even in technological development

2873.359 --> 2877.92
and architecture and design

2874.96 --> 2880.319
and engineering there's different

2877.92 --> 2882.319
directions you can go at you can focus

2880.319 --> 2884.72
on different types of technology

2882.319 --> 2886.48
just like the atlanteans focused a lot

2884.72 --> 2889.7599999999998
on natural

2886.48 --> 2892.8
electrical properties of stone

2889.76 --> 2896.4
for example so they build a lot of this

2892.8 --> 2900.88
type of natural electrical mechanics

2896.4 --> 2904.559
like non-combustion water pumps

2900.88 --> 2906.319
okay you think that that people were all

2904.559 --> 2908.7200000000003
just [ __ ] retards

2906.319 --> 2908.72
really

2909.52 --> 2913.119
and there's still things out there that

2911.2 --> 2916.72
we don't know how to construct

2913.119 --> 2918.48
even to this day really we just all just

2916.72 --> 2920.64
had to gather knowledge even those

2918.48 --> 2922.079
things built so long ago we can't even

2920.64 --> 2925.04
be sure how long ago

2922.079 --> 2926.1600000000003
and we still can't reproduce that okay

2925.04 --> 2928.64
yeah

2926.16 --> 2930.48
yeah we're always just it's only the

2928.64 --> 2933.1189999999997
last few hundred years that

2930.48 --> 2935.359
finally finally humans decided to

2933.119 --> 2943.839
smarten up right now

2935.359 --> 2943.839
no [ __ ]

2954.96 --> 2958.319
yeah jared stanford i'm gonna run at the

2957.2 --> 2961.4399999999996
show soon so i might

2958.319 --> 2963.44
just well around that i dead her here

2961.44 --> 2965.76
oh i also had a really good call by the

2963.44 --> 2970.0
way yesterday with rest ahead over skype

2965.76 --> 2972.0
until very late two and a half hours

2970.0 --> 2973.52
it was very good call and he's doing

2972.0 --> 2977.44
better

2973.52 --> 2979.92
some crazy situations yeah

2977.44 --> 2981.28
but uh yeah i did hear also about the

2979.92 --> 2984.0
cdc

2981.28 --> 2984.88
that the cdc has basically dropped the

2984.0 --> 2986.64
ball

2984.88 --> 2989.359
or dropped the ball they basically

2986.64 --> 2989.359
stepped away

2989.76 --> 2995.3590000000004
like okay we've been bought

2992.88 --> 2997.2000000000003
to put out this fake information and

2995.359 --> 2998.24
this is actually what's really going on

2997.2 --> 3000.96
this

2998.24 --> 3002.72
they had not expected that to happen

3000.96 --> 3006.96
don't know what it will

3002.72 --> 3009.5989999999997
mean i don't know what it means

3006.96 --> 3011.119
if it's going to be actually played into

3009.599 --> 3013.599
or ignored

3011.119 --> 3014.88
because the who is still going there's

3013.599 --> 3018.319
[ __ ]

3014.88 --> 3018.319
the u.n is doubling down

3018.88 --> 3025.04
the democratic party is doubling down

3021.92 --> 3027.04
but the cvc came out that it's actually

3025.04 --> 3028.16
that it has had been [ __ ] from the

3027.04 --> 3031.2
start

3028.16 --> 3031.2
so that is special

3034.03 --> 3037.1490000000003
[Music]

3039.68 --> 3045.9199999999996
but yeah we knew that most of us

3042.88 --> 3048.319
i knew that from the start didn't we i

3045.92 --> 3055.839
knew that from january

3048.319 --> 3055.839
like nope nope all [ __ ]

3056.4 --> 3063.44
i called it out i call it out on my show

3061.119 --> 3064.319
it's very adamantine when everybody was

3063.44 --> 3067.599
still like oh

3064.319 --> 3069.52
do we have to be careful but no no just

3067.599 --> 3071.28
no it's completely fake there is

3069.52 --> 3073.92
literally nothing it's not even a

3071.28 --> 3076.96
disease it's nothing

3073.92 --> 3077.76
it's physical conditions based on living

3076.96 --> 3081.119
conditions

3077.76 --> 3084.2400000000002
and sanitary situation

3081.119 --> 3087.599
yeah i called it in january

3084.24 --> 3097.839
and it is it is

3087.599 --> 3097.839
i was right irwin was right

3098.16 --> 3102.5589999999997
i haven't worn a mask a single time

3104.72 --> 3111.839
not a single time not even as a joke

3116.72 --> 3119.839
in 1888

3123.599 --> 3139.839
okay zapped happy okay

3127.119 --> 3139.839
that's weird

3145.359 --> 3148.88
oh yeah yeah that was weird little

3147.44 --> 3150.8
detail

3148.88 --> 3152.0
i think i can share that the rasta hat

3150.8 --> 3156.319
was telling me

3152.0 --> 3159.2
he went to what is it to the post office

3156.319 --> 3159.599
and there were all mask zombies in there

3159.2 --> 3161.7599999999998
the

3159.599 --> 3167.04
they were literally just standing there

3161.76 --> 3170.8
like literal zombies standing in the way

3167.04 --> 3172.88
that literal zombies mask zombies but

3170.8 --> 3174.559
literally acting like they were literal

3172.88 --> 3177.2000000000003
zombies that you would have to push

3174.559 --> 3178.1600000000003
out of the way and they would go oh like

3177.2 --> 3182.16
what the [ __ ]

3178.16 --> 3185.52
i believe him i believe that totally

3182.16 --> 3188.8799999999997
and then yeah like he got

3185.52 --> 3191.04
rasta got annoyed of course i would

3188.88 --> 3192.559
and he kind of pushed against it

3191.04 --> 3193.359
literally pushed him out of the way to

3192.559 --> 3197.28
get to the

3193.359 --> 3200.4
to into the line and then apparently the

3197.28 --> 3203.6800000000003
the woman behind the counter was so

3200.4 --> 3206.559
pissy about him not wearing a mask and

3203.68 --> 3207.1189999999997
being all defiant that she broke the

3206.559 --> 3210.4
freaking

3207.119 --> 3213.2000000000003
law and told him that a package that had

3210.4 --> 3214.48
actually arrived and he told him no we

3213.2 --> 3216.0
don't have a package

3214.48 --> 3217.68
well guess what that's a felony

3216.0 --> 3218.48
apparently i didn't know that rasta told

3217.68 --> 3221.2
me

3218.48 --> 3224.079
so yeah stupid mask lady thought that

3221.2 --> 3225.359
she had some bureaucratic power but she

3224.079 --> 3226.88
actually broke the law

3225.359 --> 3230.48
she's going to be in big trouble because

3226.88 --> 3232.2400000000002
of that because later rasta went back

3230.48 --> 3234.0
not even an hour later or something and

3232.24 --> 3237.68
then yeah

3234.0 --> 3240.96
they said yeah it's here

3237.68 --> 3241.68
so yeah she committed a felony it's very

3240.96 --> 3244.16
stupid

3241.68 --> 3244.72
when people do that and they think that

3244.16 --> 3248.16
you can

3244.72 --> 3252.72
just lie to somebody when it's

3248.16 --> 3255.44
illegal a felony in your function

3252.72 --> 3258.7999999999997
just because they don't like the person

3255.44 --> 3265.839
like it's some communist state

3258.8 --> 3265.8390000000004
well it's not

3268.8 --> 3273.44
[Music]

3271.76 --> 3274.7200000000003
did this happen in the netherlands no it

3273.44 --> 3275.44
happened in california in the

3274.72 --> 3278.48
netherlands

3275.44 --> 3281.68
nothing like this is going to happen

3278.48 --> 3284.4
like only really mentally ill people

3281.68 --> 3286.24
especially a lot of older they're

3284.4 --> 3286.88
wearing masks and they're the only ones

3286.24 --> 3289.9199999999996
and

3286.88 --> 3293.2000000000003
yes qwerty sjw women

3289.92 --> 3294.799
and their soy boy boyfriends some of

3293.2 --> 3297.7599999999998
those too

3294.799 --> 3298.799
but i barely see any masks around so but

3297.76 --> 3306.0
in california or

3298.799 --> 3309.52
rasta is yeah it's bad

3306.0 --> 3309.52
but you can still get around it

3310.799 --> 3314.96
but you got to know exactly what you

3312.88 --> 3320.319
need to do

3314.96 --> 3322.48
and make it all about liability

3320.319 --> 3323.68
so i was yeah pretty good in for info

3322.48 --> 3335.839
from rasta about that

3323.68 --> 3335.839
as well

3345.44 --> 3352.48
right it well see it like this

3349.2 --> 3354.0789999999997
if you have a job some kind you know if

3352.48 --> 3355.839
you need to do physical things you need

3354.079 --> 3357.44
to concentrate and if you don't then

3355.839 --> 3359.839
things go really wrong

3357.44 --> 3360.96
just need to tell them look i'm not

3359.839 --> 3363.839
going to wear a mask

3360.96 --> 3366.079
unless you want to be liable for what

3363.839 --> 3368.16
mistakes i will make due to oxygen

3366.079 --> 3369.559
deprivation

3368.16 --> 3371.2
because i'm not gonna take the

3369.559 --> 3375.2000000000003
responsibility

3371.2 --> 3377.04
for doing that for that

3375.2 --> 3378.3999999999996
just because you told me i need to wear

3377.04 --> 3381.52
a mask

3378.4 --> 3384.7200000000003
and if you put it like that then yeah

3381.52 --> 3384.72
you might be surprised

3385.92 --> 3392.64
that it'll actually work

3390.079 --> 3394.319
but you got to work it out in great

3392.64 --> 3396.24
detail you really got to know

3394.319 --> 3397.7599999999998
what you're talking about when you

3396.24 --> 3399.04
approach it like that

3397.76 --> 3400.96
because if you're just going to be all

3399.04 --> 3402.72
outraged no we're not supposed to do

3400.96 --> 3404.7200000000003
yeah they don't give a [ __ ] nobody gives

3402.72 --> 3405.2799999999997
a [ __ ] about that nobody gives a [ __ ]

3404.72 --> 3408.24
about

3405.28 --> 3409.76
people squirting over masks whether it's

3408.24 --> 3411.4399999999996
for it or against it no no you got to

3409.76 --> 3413.2000000000003
make it about the liability

3411.44 --> 3415.92
about the consequences of wearing that

3413.2 --> 3416.48
mask if somebody thinks they can force

3415.92 --> 3418.0
you

3416.48 --> 3420.2400000000002
and then remind them this could happen

3418.0 --> 3423.52
that could happen are you ready to

3420.24 --> 3426.799
to pay for what could happen if you're

3423.52 --> 3426.799
going to force me to wear this

3427.68 --> 3431.1189999999997
and make them sign for it if they say

3430.72 --> 3434.72
yes

3431.119 --> 3438.48
make them sign like yeah

3434.72 --> 3441.5989999999997

3438.48 --> 3445.2
