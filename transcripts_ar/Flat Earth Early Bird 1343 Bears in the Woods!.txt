work but when you got it it's really

402.16 --> 405.36
like

403.12 --> 408.88

colorado

590.56 --> 595.68
right

591.44 --> 597.9200000000001
5 30. yeah that's incredibly early

595.68 --> 598.7199999999999
so you're like on the west coast

597.92 --> 603.4799999999999
or

598.72 --> 603.48
near the west coast i take it

609.2 --> 611.519
right

612.0 --> 617.48
anyway i don't know really what i'm

613.76 --> 617.48
gonna talk about today

624.56 --> 627.1999999999999
a clutch

630.959 --> 636.079
rocky mountains okay

634.0 --> 638.399
i don't know exactly where that is

636.079 --> 638.399
though

638.8 --> 644.7199999999999
i mean i know roughly where the states

641.92 --> 645.76
are and all that and mountains and lakes

644.72 --> 648.64
roughly

645.76 --> 651.36
but i can't really

648.64 --> 655.519
like my topography

651.36 --> 658.64
would like get a six or seven

655.519 --> 660.32
for america not like i'm not an american

658.64 --> 662.8
oh by the way americans themselves

660.32 --> 664.9590000000001
usually don't even know everything

662.8 --> 664.959
but

670.399 --> 673.04
in the middle

673.36 --> 678.32
it's in the middle but how can it then

675.279 --> 678.32
be 5 30

678.959 --> 682.2399999999999
that's really weird because

682.88 --> 687.36
in california which is way over at the

685.44 --> 691.0400000000001
west coast

687.36 --> 691.04
it's that time too isn't it

693.36 --> 700.279
that's just so odd

696.56 --> 700.279
how's that even possible

712.72 --> 717.839
4 28 in california oh okay

726.079 --> 729.76
one hour later then

728.56 --> 730.8
canada

729.76 --> 732.639
yeah

730.8 --> 735.12
right anyway

732.639 --> 735.12
welcome

737.44 --> 740.44
huh

770.32 --> 775.9200000000001
would long fbd show yesterday yeah it

772.32 --> 777.6800000000001
was great very long

775.92 --> 779.1999999999999
indeed

777.68 --> 782.1999999999999
i don't remember what we were doing

779.2 --> 782.2
though

789.92 --> 794.279
i don't even remember if i was all that

791.68 --> 798.3599999999999
active it was it was kind of

794.279 --> 798.36
hot uh

801.839 --> 808.1600000000001
yeah nathan was really on to it

805.12 --> 810.72
and like kiwi got in there too

808.16 --> 812.959
it's weird like when kiwi gets in there

810.72 --> 815.12
on a tuesday i almost have a tendency to

812.959 --> 818.6389999999999
say like hey kiwi you might want to save

815.12 --> 820.9590000000001
some of that energy for your show later

818.639 --> 825.199
but he does it a lot though that he just

820.959 --> 825.199
comes on on tuesday and just like

826.56 --> 829.8389999999999
has a tendency to dominate

831.279 --> 836.639
right but to be fair i did not really

834.0 --> 839.36
follow kiwi live yesterday i was chat

836.639 --> 842.399
skanking in for a bit

839.36 --> 843.6800000000001
but then i kind of just like

842.399 --> 846.88
went

843.68 --> 846.88
and watched other things

847.04 --> 851.8389999999999
like a bit of gymbops went who had

849.76 --> 856.199
brenda on again

851.839 --> 856.1990000000001
i didn't really finish all that either

861.76 --> 865.519
i went to bed really early so

866.72 --> 870.639
i do not have a lot of videos to

869.12 --> 873.12
reference to

870.639 --> 873.12
right now

873.199 --> 877.519
oh yeah dale went live again so he's

875.44 --> 880.639
still there

877.519 --> 883.639
i did catch some of that

880.639 --> 883.639
uh

893.519 --> 899.839
the debates are like wolves at a meal

896.8 --> 900.88
they can be sometimes

899.839 --> 903.6
yeah

900.88 --> 906.24
like especially when everybody's rowdy

903.6 --> 908.16
like monday

906.24 --> 909.92
like then it's absolutely like wolves

908.16 --> 912.7199999999999
and you have to be really careful to

909.92 --> 915.199
take a bite

912.72 --> 919.639
and yesterday it was a bit rowdy too not

915.199 --> 919.639
as heavy as monday but still

927.199 --> 929.5999999999999
okay

931.279 --> 936.48
noticed any benefits from shum guide

933.759 --> 936.48
stone what

937.839 --> 940.839
what

971.68 --> 974.68
ugh

1000.0 --> 1004.16
who is that what are you talking about

1007.839 --> 1012.8000000000001
i still don't know who that is george

1009.44 --> 1012.8000000000001
sanford what are you talking about

1018.0 --> 1022.56
put one of those shungite rocks

1021.36 --> 1025.56
a filter

1022.56 --> 1025.56
okay

1048.48 --> 1054.48
okay so it is a mostly carbon type of

1052.16 --> 1054.48
rock

1057.76 --> 1062.4
does it have to supposed to have

1059.76 --> 1062.4
properties

1062.96 --> 1068.799
wait

1065.12 --> 1071.039
that sounds a lot like this

1068.799 --> 1072.8799999999999
which is not shungite like what i'm

1071.039 --> 1076.799
reading here some description oh it

1072.88 --> 1076.7990000000002
neutralizes radiation

1078.4 --> 1084.24
like electromagnetic radiation well this

1082.08 --> 1086.72
this rock does that too but it's not

1084.24 --> 1088.559
shungite see it's this very specific

1086.72 --> 1091.6000000000001
type of

1088.559 --> 1094.6
is the name again

1091.6 --> 1094.6
uh

1098.48 --> 1102.559
not shanghai

1100.0 --> 1102.559
i forgot

1107.52 --> 1113.2
oh yeah black tourmaline

1110.799 --> 1113.2
i think

1119.919 --> 1123.8400000000001
yes

1120.88 --> 1123.8400000000001
that's what it is

1124.08 --> 1126.08
because that

1125.36 --> 1127.52
i

1126.08 --> 1130.24
pretty much

1127.52 --> 1131.96
has the same effects it's claimed to be

1130.24 --> 1134.16
a neutralizer of

1131.96 --> 1137.8400000000001
electromagnetic radiation that's why i

1134.16 --> 1137.8400000000001
have one on my computer

1141.679 --> 1145.919
so

1142.72 --> 1148.0
i'm not putting it in my water though

1145.919 --> 1151.0
i don't see why you'd put it in your

1148.0 --> 1151.0
water

1165.919 --> 1170.0800000000002
burned them down last year what

1176.48 --> 1181.32
i get it apgnet

1201.039 --> 1205.28
forest fires

1203.6 --> 1207.039
who are you asking

1205.28 --> 1209.9189999999999
rick henry

1207.039 --> 1214.76
there's no forest fires here

1209.919 --> 1214.76
but this is a lot of river land so

1255.6 --> 1262.36
wow really clutch so they're just

1257.76 --> 1262.36

1274.799 --> 1281.039
summer we get fires where are you rick

1277.76 --> 1281.039

1284.559 --> 1288.6789999999999
i think you've told us

1307.919 --> 1311.64
washington okay

1319.76 --> 1326.1589999999999
oh i think i'm gonna take my t-shirt out

1322.24 --> 1328.08
guys this is just so freaking annoying

1326.159 --> 1330.3200000000002
sorry

1328.08 --> 1330.32
oh

1330.4 --> 1333.8400000000001
it's just too warm

1334.08 --> 1337.799
i can't do it

1357.52 --> 1363.52
yeah pgc net that's right in past there

1360.0 --> 1363.52
was a lot more forest fires

1365.44 --> 1370.0800000000002
and now there is more

1367.679 --> 1373.0800000000002
management in the sense that

1370.08 --> 1373.08
just

1374.24 --> 1378.24
controlled burns

1377.12 --> 1381.84
and

1378.24 --> 1381.84
also removing dead wood

1382.08 --> 1384.32
right

1387.28 --> 1393.32
that's really caused the amount of

1389.2 --> 1393.32
forest fires to go down

1429.84 --> 1431.9189999999999
you

1450.4 --> 1456.0
but yeah interesting clutch i wonder if

1452.64 --> 1458.64
like a hundred years ago

1456.0 --> 1462.0
wild animals like elks and mooses and

1458.64 --> 1465.039
bears also just walked into people's

1462.0 --> 1465.039
gardens over there

1465.2 --> 1471.279
or if that's really like a more recent

1467.52 --> 1473.9189999999999
trend because i have seen like plenty of

1471.279 --> 1475.039
videos of people just

1473.919 --> 1478.88
yeah

1475.039 --> 1478.8799999999999
seeing an animal walk into their

1479.52 --> 1487.72
into their garden or like i've even seen

1482.799 --> 1487.72
videos of mooses like

1487.76 --> 1491.84
like getting stuck in people's pools and

1490.24 --> 1495.2
[ __ ]

1491.84 --> 1495.1999999999998
the really silly is

1495.44 --> 1498.559
so

1496.24 --> 1500.4
that does happen now

1498.559 --> 1502.799
more often

1500.4 --> 1505.44
i mean you could make a video library of

1502.799 --> 1507.84
that sort of thing by now and i wonder

1505.44 --> 1511.039
if there was the same 100 years ago or

1507.84 --> 1514.1589999999999
if the animals were much more shy

1511.039 --> 1516.08
and or the people back then would just

1514.159 --> 1517.6000000000001
freaking kill

1516.08 --> 1520.559
just

1517.6 --> 1523.6789999999999
less animal sympathy because animal

1520.559 --> 1526.24
sympathy has like really been culturally

1523.679 --> 1529.8400000000001
ingrained in the last 100 years

1526.24 --> 1529.84
in western culture

1530.799 --> 1535.36
and i don't think that's bad but it does

1533.039 --> 1537.039
lead to people being oversensitive and

1535.36 --> 1539.6789999999999
cuddly towards animals when they

1537.039 --> 1543.08
probably shouldn't

1539.679 --> 1543.0800000000002
that's the downside

1550.559 --> 1553.52
an issue in the past

1554.08 --> 1557.84
fence it up

1555.44 --> 1557.8400000000001
right

1560.08 --> 1564.08
so that's always just happened

1562.08 --> 1566.48
they always just come barging in even in

1564.08 --> 1566.48
the past

1567.12 --> 1570.3999999999999
but of course back then nobody would be

1568.96 --> 1573.039
filming that

1570.4 --> 1575.3600000000001
they might have weird stories and then

1573.039 --> 1577.2
maybe people that weren't in that region

1575.36 --> 1579.52
i might just not believe it they'd think

1577.2 --> 1581.52
like oh yeah sure canadian all the

1579.52 --> 1583.6
animals just come walking in like a

1581.52 --> 1585.76
disney cartoon okay

1583.6 --> 1590.1999999999998
but now there's cameras everywhere so

1585.76 --> 1590.2
people actually film that [ __ ]

1612.48 --> 1616.72
i keep getting lake puncher train bridge

1614.64 --> 1618.72
sent to me

1616.72 --> 1619.84
is the black swan the best debunk for

1618.72 --> 1622.159
that

1619.84 --> 1622.1589999999999
yeah

1622.24 --> 1627.6
i mean

1624.559 --> 1630.1589999999999
a bridge showing curve is just extremely

1627.6 --> 1632.1589999999999
outdated that's such an outdated

1630.159 --> 1633.8400000000001
argument it's no longer relevant but

1632.159 --> 1635.919
yeah they'll still keep throwing it at

1633.84 --> 1641.08
you though despite

1635.919 --> 1641.0800000000002
hey elise g good to see you flatter sage

1651.6 --> 1655.399
that's right george sanford

1678.08 --> 1681.36
supper

1680.399 --> 1682.9599999999998
uh

1681.36 --> 1684.8799999999999
i think that those types of animals are

1682.96 --> 1687.8400000000001
going to be more than supper that's more

1684.88 --> 1690.159
like having food for like a month if you

1687.84 --> 1693.4399999999998
know a proper

1690.159 --> 1694.5590000000002
butcher or if you can do that yourself

1693.44 --> 1697.52
and you got

1694.559 --> 1697.52
freezer's space

1700.88 --> 1705.2
i mean a moose has a lot of freaking

1702.88 --> 1705.2
meats

1705.84 --> 1710.4399999999998
rifles have been replaced by iphones

1718.799 --> 1721.039
right

1721.52 --> 1728.559
i guess people's priority has gone from

1725.36 --> 1730.6399999999999
food to ooh clicks i can get clicks out

1728.559 --> 1732.72
of that not oh i can get food out of

1730.64 --> 1736.24
this but oh i can get clicks out of this

1732.72 --> 1736.24
oh camera oh look at that

1736.399 --> 1739.399
right

1752.559 --> 1756.1589999999999
all right hello by the way gortilla

1758.0 --> 1763.96
feels like everybody's here lots of

1760.0 --> 1763.96
people in the chat nice

1795.36 --> 1801.4399999999998
what hunting licenses have been reduced

1799.52 --> 1802.799
and now their population is growing yeah

1801.44 --> 1804.559
that's weird

1802.799 --> 1806.72
i mean

1804.559 --> 1808.559
look

1806.72 --> 1811.679
if you want to like ooh spare the

1808.559 --> 1814.24
animals i i totally get it right but if

1811.679 --> 1816.64
they just come freaking moving into your

1814.24 --> 1818.96
neighborhood and

1816.64 --> 1820.3200000000002
causing a habit or even getting people

1818.96 --> 1823.48
hurt

1820.32 --> 1823.48
i mean

1825.2 --> 1830.64
you gotta take care of it

1827.84 --> 1833.52
like you either gotta find a way to like

1830.64 --> 1835.44
reliably scare them off so that they

1833.52 --> 1836.48
really don't come back or you just gotta

1835.44 --> 1839.2
shoot him

1836.48 --> 1841.76
because as you said like yeah

1839.2 --> 1843.6000000000001
they're probably just moving out to find

1841.76 --> 1845.2
new territory and

1843.6 --> 1849.399
because their territory is probably

1845.2 --> 1849.3990000000001
already taken by other bears

1850.48 --> 1854.799
i mean if you don't then

1852.559 --> 1856.8799999999999
before you know it like

1854.799 --> 1859.9189999999999
half the population in your mountain

1856.88 --> 1862.24
village is going to be bears

1859.919 --> 1863.44
that may sound like a joke

1862.24 --> 1866.159
but

1863.44 --> 1870.519
it it doesn't necessarily have to be a

1866.159 --> 1870.519
joke that's not yeah

1878.159 --> 1882.24
are very intelligent i agree and i

1879.919 --> 1884.72
wouldn't i wouldn't like

1882.24 --> 1886.559
that i i like bears i don't like the

1884.72 --> 1889.559
idea of like killing bears i really

1886.559 --> 1889.559
don't

1892.08 --> 1895.36
teddy bear was my

1895.519 --> 1898.08
my uh

1898.72 --> 1903.3600000000001
my animal of choice as a kid

1901.44 --> 1905.44
so i feel a lot of sympathy for bears

1903.36 --> 1906.4799999999998
but yeah if they are doing great and

1905.44 --> 1907.76
they're just

1906.48 --> 1910.08
moving out

1907.76 --> 1912.24
because the territory is taken

1910.08 --> 1916.24
yeah what are you gonna do just

1912.24 --> 1916.24
let them dominate your village

1917.36 --> 1923.519
like a certain type of people that might

1920.72 --> 1926.159
do exactly the same thing if you don't

1923.519 --> 1928.559
scare them off

1926.159 --> 1928.5590000000002
you know

1931.6 --> 1936.32
i mean to the bears it's just about

1934.159 --> 1938.24
territory right

1936.32 --> 1940.799
and maybe food opportunity but that's

1938.24 --> 1942.72
bad i mean if bears like literally get

1940.799 --> 1945.519
an idea like hey

1942.72 --> 1947.279
they got food there i keep coming back

1945.519 --> 1949.519
for their food like get it from the

1947.279 --> 1951.279
trash cans or i don't know scare a

1949.519 --> 1953.1200000000001
person and then just steal their

1951.279 --> 1956.399
sandwich

1953.12 --> 1958.7199999999998
right if they get that idea that means

1956.399 --> 1962.8799999999999
that's gonna be their

1958.72 --> 1966.0
way to get food the rest of their lives

1962.88 --> 1966.0
do you understand that

1967.919 --> 1973.279
once they get the idea that they can get

1970.24 --> 1975.039
their food that way through people areas

1973.279 --> 1978.32
then they'll never leave you alone

1975.039 --> 1978.32
they'll always try to come back

1979.039 --> 1984.24
they'll be like very big

1981.36 --> 1985.6789999999999
hairy bums

1984.24 --> 1988.0
that

1985.679 --> 1988.0
yeah

1989.12 --> 1996.7199999999998
that are a lot stronger than human bombs

1993.36 --> 1998.7199999999998
so they you gotta yeah maybe it by that

1996.72 --> 2001.2
sense it's even better if like yeah it

1998.72 --> 2002.96
sounds so harsh right and especially

2001.2 --> 2004.64
kids wouldn't like that at all but if a

2002.96 --> 2005.76
bear just comes in a village and just

2004.64 --> 2007.6000000000001
constantly

2005.76 --> 2009.76
digs through the trash

2007.6 --> 2010.799
you probably should shoot it

2009.76 --> 2013.2
because

2010.799 --> 2015.76
unless you want to keep a local bear

2013.2 --> 2015.76
somehow

2015.919 --> 2018.64
like

2016.72 --> 2020.3990000000001
they're just never gonna go away and

2018.64 --> 2022.7990000000002
like how are they gonna live in the wild

2020.399 --> 2025.12
after that point after they got the

2022.799 --> 2028.1589999999999
taste

2025.12 --> 2028.1589999999999
of human food

2028.88 --> 2032.0390000000002
you know

2046.559 --> 2051.7599999999998
yeah steamy traveler i know but it's not

2048.96 --> 2053.919
about oh it might get somebody killed no

2051.76 --> 2056.3990000000003
if this is about i that's not what i

2053.919 --> 2059.1189999999997
meant i'm not saying like oh bears are

2056.399 --> 2060.56
so dangerous in a village and that's why

2059.119 --> 2064.079
you gotta shoot that's not what i said

2060.56 --> 2064.0789999999997
at all i said it because

2064.879 --> 2067.52
one yeah

2068.72 --> 2073.2799999999997
once you allow them to do that they they

2070.8 --> 2076.96
get sort of half domesticated and like

2073.28 --> 2078.8790000000004
how they're probably just

2076.96 --> 2081.28
not gonna survive in the wild anymore

2078.879 --> 2081.2799999999997
anyway

2083.679 --> 2086.56
what you call me

2087.28 --> 2092.96
a big hairy bum i think this is

2090.639 --> 2097.879
what i'm talking about

2092.96 --> 2097.879
the actual animal species bears

2103.599 --> 2107.6400000000003
not human bears

2116.72 --> 2121.04
people are much more dangerous yeah of

2119.2 --> 2126.0
course they are

2121.04 --> 2126.0
but they also have rights legal rights

2128.88 --> 2133.28
so it's not as easy to get rid of that

2139.119 --> 2143.1600000000003
right yeah well if a black bear leaves

2141.44 --> 2145.92
people alone it doesn't

2143.16 --> 2148.0
continually come walking in villages and

2145.92 --> 2149.76
all that then it's fine

2148.0 --> 2153.96
that means they'll stick to nature

2149.76 --> 2153.96
that's great that's perfect

2181.359 --> 2185.04
right

2182.24 --> 2186.7999999999997
so my advice would be you notice a bear

2185.04 --> 2188.72
walking into your back garden or

2186.8 --> 2190.7200000000003
something

2188.72 --> 2193.2
just

2190.72 --> 2195.839
give them warning shots

2193.2 --> 2198.0789999999997
and hope they go away and don't come

2195.839 --> 2201.0789999999997
back if they keep coming back you got a

2198.079 --> 2201.079
problem

2213.599 --> 2217.2000000000003
right and if they're gonna assault you

2215.119 --> 2218.7200000000003
yeah then you just gotta kill him of

2217.2 --> 2220.8799999999997
course

2218.72 --> 2223.68
i mean don't risk your life just to

2220.88 --> 2226.48
spare the bear

2223.68 --> 2230.9199999999996
but only if you yeah if he like comes

2226.48 --> 2230.92
charging at you or something right

2239.36 --> 2242.389
[Music]

2257.76 --> 2262.48
right and if you encounter a bear with

2260.32 --> 2264.96
cubs then it's a whole different story

2262.48 --> 2267.359
be very careful

2264.96 --> 2267.359
and like

2268.079 --> 2272.96
i don't know

2269.68 --> 2275.04
this is where my expertise if any

2272.96 --> 2277.2
stops you'd have to ask a real bear

2275.04 --> 2278.48
special i just know that bears with cubs

2277.2 --> 2280.0
are like

2278.48 --> 2282.16
really

2280.0 --> 2284.72
aggressive like even if you're like oh

2282.16 --> 2287.2799999999997
look at that and then they're like

2284.72 --> 2289.7599999999998
get out of here

2287.28 --> 2291.119
right you shouldn't like shoot them for

2289.76 --> 2293.3590000000004
that

2291.119 --> 2295.92
so if you notice bear cubs around well

2293.359 --> 2298.92
then mother bear and cops might be just

2295.92 --> 2298.92
fleeing

2299.04 --> 2304.48
other bears or

2300.8 --> 2306.88
bad bear which yeah that bears can be

2304.48 --> 2309.28
dangerous to cubs

2306.88 --> 2311.119
they might be just migrating and just

2309.28 --> 2313.6800000000003
let them pass through i mean

2311.119 --> 2314.8
a mother bear with her cubs is not gonna

2313.68 --> 2317.52
like

2314.8 --> 2320.2400000000002
stay in a village that's not safe enough

2317.52 --> 2320.24
for your cubs

2324.56 --> 2329.359
i think never heard of that

2327.76 --> 2331.8390000000004
i mean you see

2329.359 --> 2334.0
bears with cubs moving around sometimes

2331.839 --> 2337.7599999999998
by the road or something

2334.0 --> 2340.32
but you don't like see them

2337.76 --> 2342.96
i've never seen like a mother bear

2340.32 --> 2345.2000000000003
roaming a trash can with cups right next

2342.96 --> 2346.96
to her like never seen that it's always

2345.2 --> 2349.04
like just

2346.96 --> 2351.28
male bears or just

2349.04 --> 2354.48
territorial bears

2351.28 --> 2357.44
but with cups they don't do that

2354.48 --> 2357.44
i've never seen that

2361.28 --> 2366.599
friendly bear

2363.359 --> 2366.5989999999997
what's that

2379.92 --> 2383.16
oh god

2387.92 --> 2390.56
freaky

2390.96 --> 2393.599
oh [ __ ]

2393.92 --> 2397.56
that's pretty dangerous

2398.88 --> 2403.04
certainly glad for those

2400.96 --> 2405.599
for those ladies that the bear seems to

2403.04 --> 2408.079
be sort of in a good mood but this is

2405.599 --> 2408.079
freaky

2409.599 --> 2415.8
i think that bear likes the smell of her

2412.319 --> 2415.8
hair or something

2441.52 --> 2443.839
dude

2444.24 --> 2448.9599999999996
that is pretty scary though having a

2446.72 --> 2449.839
bear just

2448.96 --> 2451.76
like

2449.839 --> 2454.96
drag your leg

2451.76 --> 2454.96
and smell your hair

2455.28 --> 2458.3190000000004
that's pretty freaky

2458.96 --> 2465.8
i'm glad for her she he didn't decide to

2461.52 --> 2465.8
like take a bite or something

2470.72 --> 2475.5989999999997
that's very concerning when you see a

2472.64 --> 2476.48
baby bear with no mother around yes

2475.599 --> 2478.96
yes

2476.48 --> 2480.72
then something bad must have happened to

2478.96 --> 2483.119
mother bear

2480.72 --> 2486.1189999999997
because mother bears never abandon their

2483.119 --> 2486.119
children

2498.079 --> 2501.28
hey ralph rodriguez

2504.319 --> 2508.56
snowbirds

2506.48 --> 2511.04
didn't have a shirt on yeah it's

2508.56 --> 2513.119
because it's hot okay it's just hot i

2511.04 --> 2515.68
tried with the shirt on it was just not

2513.119 --> 2517.839
doable i was starting to feel nauseated

2515.68 --> 2521.64
from the heat

2517.839 --> 2521.64
and this is just better

2522.56 --> 2526.48
i can't believe it's two o'clock and the

2524.72 --> 2529.2799999999997
sun is still

2526.48 --> 2531.28
like half a meter hitting my wall here's

2529.28 --> 2533.2000000000003
what the hell

2531.28 --> 2534.7200000000003
i thought the summer was drawing to an

2533.2 --> 2537.839
end

2534.72 --> 2537.839
is this

2542.64 --> 2548.4
don't think we have bears in australia

2545.28 --> 2548.4
just koala bears

2548.96 --> 2551.28
huh

2551.52 --> 2554.48
yeah

2552.64 --> 2557.8799999999997
you might be right there susie has never

2554.48 --> 2557.88
thought of that

2584.96 --> 2590.88
i've heard this scene regarding the

2586.72 --> 2593.7599999999998
black bears black attack brown lay down

2590.88 --> 2596.48
perhaps

2593.76 --> 2598.5600000000004
it depends on their mood though you know

2596.48 --> 2601.2
if they just happen to be kind of pissed

2598.56 --> 2603.2799999999997
off and are looking

2601.2 --> 2606.0
for acting out then you might just be

2603.28 --> 2610.0
getting it right but the thing that i

2606.0 --> 2610.0
learned from bears is you got to be

2610.4 --> 2615.76
once you figure out there's a bear

2613.2 --> 2618.72
at a distance

2615.76 --> 2620.6400000000003
don't try to hide but like make noise

2618.72 --> 2622.9599999999996
make yourself known and make yourself

2620.64 --> 2623.839
look bigger

2622.96 --> 2625.119
and

2623.839 --> 2628.0789999999997
have a

2625.119 --> 2629.28
strong stick as a backup would be great

2628.079 --> 2630.48
i mean if you're in the woods you're

2629.28 --> 2632.48
probably going to be able to find a

2630.48 --> 2635.359
stick pretty easy

2632.48 --> 2637.28
but you want to be able to

2635.359 --> 2639.68
like if they like if they're still

2637.28 --> 2641.3590000000004
coming towards you then you got to use

2639.68 --> 2645.9199999999996
that stick to keep your distance and

2641.359 --> 2645.92
like poke hard if necessary right

2646.48 --> 2652.4
so that they can't get near you can't

2649.04 --> 2654.64
get their claws on you

2652.4 --> 2656.4
a stick yeah hey

2654.64 --> 2657.92
you know if it works it works but make

2656.4 --> 2659.76
sure it's a thick stick if it's just

2657.92 --> 2662.4
some tiny little stick it's just gonna

2659.76 --> 2665.28
break like a little tweak so

2662.4 --> 2668.56
a good thick stick of like at least five

2665.28 --> 2672.6400000000003
centimeters or something that's

2668.56 --> 2672.64
like one and a half meters long

2672.72 --> 2677.5989999999997
as tall as you are that would work great

2675.839 --> 2679.359
maybe even longer

2677.599 --> 2680.7200000000003
just having that

2679.359 --> 2684.4
around or

2680.72 --> 2686.72
yeah if you use it like a

2684.4 --> 2687.839
sort of a walking stick like that or a

2686.72 --> 2691.48
staff

2687.839 --> 2691.48
that would work great

2694.48 --> 2700.64
i mean it's a great advantage to be able

2696.8 --> 2703.2000000000003
to keep very large animals at a distance

2700.64 --> 2706.56
unless they literally come like

2703.2 --> 2708.3999999999996
galloping charging you because then

2706.56 --> 2712.64
yeah that stick's not gonna matter too

2708.4 --> 2712.64
much unless you brace it in the ground

2712.72 --> 2718.2799999999997
and then yeah things could still go very

2715.28 --> 2718.28
wrong

2718.88 --> 2723.2000000000003
i mean if something comes charging after

2720.88 --> 2724.2400000000002
you really fast it's best to just make

2723.2 --> 2727.2799999999997
sure to

2724.24 --> 2731.9599999999996
to have like a decently strong tree in

2727.28 --> 2731.96
between you and the charging animal

2733.119 --> 2736.319
if you can outrun it

2744.56 --> 2748.72
bears can be curious right yeah but you

2746.4 --> 2752.64
could well i can sense the difference i

2748.72 --> 2752.64
mean if a bear is agitated

2753.599 --> 2757.839
and

2755.04 --> 2760.48
ready to deal some blows

2757.839 --> 2761.68
they're gonna sound and

2760.48 --> 2764.0
like hold

2761.68 --> 2764.0
their

2766.16 --> 2770.0
say that their composure is gonna be

2768.0 --> 2772.4
different

2770.0 --> 2773.599
it's kind of like it's the same as with

2772.4 --> 2775.6800000000003
humans

2773.599 --> 2777.92
they just have different attitudes you

2775.68 --> 2779.1189999999997
can recognize that by the way they sound

2777.92 --> 2780.4
their own

2779.119 --> 2781.44
sounds and

2780.4 --> 2783.44
just

2781.44 --> 2785.839
how they're moving if they're really if

2783.44 --> 2787.44
they're being really quick that's like a

2785.839 --> 2789.2799999999997
sign that they might be agitated if

2787.44 --> 2791.359
they're really slow

2789.28 --> 2794.3590000000004
moving then they're usually kind of

2791.359 --> 2794.359
relaxed

2808.16 --> 2810.64
jesus

2812.8 --> 2817.2000000000003
okay george stanford that's screwed up

2815.28 --> 2819.76
yeah i don't know if like climbing a

2817.2 --> 2821.9199999999996
tree is really the best tactic if a bear

2819.76 --> 2824.1600000000003
comes charging at you

2821.92 --> 2826.8
i i didn't mean like

2824.16 --> 2828.96
climb the tree i just like make sure

2826.8 --> 2832.319
that

2828.96 --> 2835.68
yeah you don't just get overrun that you

2832.319 --> 2838.16
don't get stampeded and then have a tree

2835.68 --> 2840.64
in between you right

2838.16 --> 2842.24
that that was it not like climbing the

2840.64 --> 2844.72
tree i don't know if that's really a

2842.24 --> 2847.2
good tactic unless you're a really quick

2844.72 --> 2847.2
climber

2851.2 --> 2854.72
bear spray yeah sure

2855.92 --> 2859.48
bear pepper spray

2859.92 --> 2863.319
that can work

2892.8 --> 2896.2400000000002
try talking to the bear

2896.8 --> 2899.8
maybe

2900.64 --> 2904.64
but what if he doesn't sound like the

2903.119 --> 2906.48
sound of your voice

2904.64 --> 2908.7999999999997
or what if you're like nervous like the

2906.48 --> 2909.76
bear is going to hear that in your voice

2908.8 --> 2913.1600000000003
right

2909.76 --> 2913.1600000000003
they're not stupid

2927.04 --> 2931.359
depending on the bear they can climb

2928.48 --> 2931.359
trees too yeah

2931.92 --> 2935.92
i think especially like when they're

2933.52 --> 2938.96
still younger then some of them actually

2935.92 --> 2938.96
do climb trees

2940.16 --> 2943.7599999999998
hey that's how you get the honey

2942.64 --> 2946.64
you know

2943.76 --> 2948.4
by climbing trees that's where the

2946.64 --> 2949.92
honey

2948.4 --> 2953.96
combs are

2949.92 --> 2953.96
most of the time in the wild

2958.88 --> 2963.04
and worse what if he doesn't understand

2960.8 --> 2964.8
no it's not about the language it's

2963.04 --> 2966.319
about the tone

2964.8 --> 2968.4
yeah

2966.319 --> 2970.48
i mean animals don't literally

2968.4 --> 2972.2400000000002
understand language

2970.48 --> 2974.0
some might be able to mimic it like

2972.24 --> 2976.64
parrots that doesn't mean that they

2974.0 --> 2980.079
really understand what it means

2976.64 --> 2982.48
but animals can listen to the tone they

2980.079 --> 2985.28
listen to the tone of each other and of

2982.48 --> 2986.559
other animals i listen to the tone of

2985.28 --> 2988.3190000000004
animals

2986.559 --> 2990.6400000000003
because it says everything about their

2988.319 --> 2993.2799999999997
state of mind and

2990.64 --> 2996.96
and thus also gives you a predictability

2993.28 --> 2998.96
factor as to what they would or might do

2996.96 --> 3002.839
and animals do that too and they can do

2998.96 --> 3002.839
it with humans as well

3012.24 --> 3016.16
that's right fluttershy yeah yeah i said

3014.24 --> 3019.7599999999998
that earlier just

3016.16 --> 3019.7599999999998
beat big tall and loud

3021.04 --> 3024.16
but make sure that you don't do that too

3023.119 --> 3026.4
late

3024.16 --> 3028.16
make sure that you do that as soon as

3026.4 --> 3029.599
you spot it in the distance if you're

3028.16 --> 3031.3599999999997
going to do that when it's like two

3029.599 --> 3034.0
meters away from you uh

3031.36 --> 3036.6400000000003
[Music]

3034.0 --> 3039.04
it might work or you might get really

3036.64 --> 3042.8799999999997
unlucky and startle him and then he

3039.04 --> 3042.88
launches at you so

3047.52 --> 3050.319
but if you're at a distance

3049.52 --> 3051.92
then

3050.319 --> 3055.119
a bear might

3051.92 --> 3057.04
more likely decide like oh no i'm not

3055.119 --> 3059.359
gonna investigate that that might be

3057.04 --> 3061.92
risky but if they're right next to you

3059.359 --> 3063.7599999999998
then they're gonna be startled by that

3061.92 --> 3067.4
they might even take it as a challenge

3063.76 --> 3067.4
you don't want that

3068.319 --> 3075.079
we're talking about bears in the woods

3071.28 --> 3075.079
today apparently

3082.46 --> 3085.65
[Music]

3097.28 --> 3100.28
ugh

3117.2 --> 3121.7599999999998
yes gadget inspector i was waiting for

3119.68 --> 3124.0
you to make that joke

3121.76 --> 3126.079
because you got to be french to steal

3124.0 --> 3128.319
after all that make that joke and still

3126.079 --> 3131.48
think it's funny

3128.319 --> 3131.48
i know

3141.599 --> 3144.599
ugh

3161.44 --> 3167.7200000000003
whoa what's a 10 point buck what does

3164.48 --> 3167.72
that mean

3168.48 --> 3172.8
it's taking star wars but you faced a

3170.72 --> 3176.1189999999997
huge bear yesterday that's interesting

3172.8 --> 3176.119
what a coincidence

3182.079 --> 3185.079
hmm

3194.559 --> 3196.88
there

3199.04 --> 3201.2799999999997
oh

3204.4 --> 3207.52
oh so it wasn't a bear

3207.599 --> 3213.2000000000003
a deer right sorry

3210.48 --> 3216.2
mix it up there

3213.2 --> 3216.2
cool

3231.28 --> 3236.44
i don't think i've ever seen like a wild

3233.44 --> 3236.44
deer

3236.48 --> 3240.88
i did see like a couple of bambi's

3238.64 --> 3240.8799999999997
though

3243.92 --> 3247.76
like really young there

3248.0 --> 3251.839
but that's not like a

3253.04 --> 3257.92
a real dear

3256.0 --> 3261.2
like if it's

3257.92 --> 3263.76
if it's only like this big is that like

3261.2 --> 3265.68
a deer

3263.76 --> 3268.0
or is that a different species i'm not

3265.68 --> 3268.0
sure

3268.88 --> 3276.4
i've seen a couple of those in the woods

3271.839 --> 3280.4
but not like like moose sized

3276.4 --> 3280.4
or like really big deer

3286.64 --> 3291.24
mute no i'm not mute

3300.64 --> 3304.16
nowadays there are no bears in the wild

3302.319 --> 3306.4
yeah no [ __ ] this

3304.16 --> 3309.68
i know steamy traveler

3306.4 --> 3312.319
no gorzilla i'm not muted

3309.68 --> 3314.319
i can literally see my mic

3312.319 --> 3316.72
sound bar going back and forth as i'm

3314.319 --> 3320.599
talking

3316.72 --> 3320.5989999999997
yeah it is you i know

3320.64 --> 3324.44
don't worry about it

3347.839 --> 3349.92
you

3368.079 --> 3372.799
and she picked up camry was gone

3370.559 --> 3375.119
well maybe he just had a a private

3372.799 --> 3377.2
message from the animal world before you

3375.119 --> 3380.48
didn't want to be

3377.2 --> 3382.48
subjected to some animal stardom on the

3380.48 --> 3384.48
internet

3382.48 --> 3387.839
i mean i'm pretty sure that animals are

3384.48 --> 3387.839
aware that we do that

3388.0 --> 3393.76
they are aware that we put

3391.599 --> 3394.48
their performance their appearance on

3393.76 --> 3396.6400000000003
the

3394.48 --> 3399.28
on some virtual place where we keep

3396.64 --> 3402.0
looking at it

3399.28 --> 3403.0400000000004
i think they know

3402.0 --> 3404.88
a lot of

3403.04 --> 3407.52
animals do know that

3404.88 --> 3409.6800000000003
that we do that

3407.52 --> 3412.64
right they have this weird awareness

3409.68 --> 3415.1189999999997
where they can just feel it like hey

3412.64 --> 3417.44
i'm being watched watch not just

3415.119 --> 3419.44
somebody peeking but just somebody like

3417.44 --> 3421.68
really watching

3419.44 --> 3423.68
they can feel it

3421.68 --> 3426.0789999999997
like even yesterday as i was trying to

3423.68 --> 3428.3999999999996
film the magpies taking a bath they were

3426.079 --> 3430.0
just aware that i was trying to fill

3428.4 --> 3431.04
them and then just

3430.0 --> 3432.799
get out

3431.04 --> 3435.04
and then i stopped pulled the camera

3432.799 --> 3436.88
away and then it got in immediately

3435.04 --> 3438.4
camera back to it and they run out again

3436.88 --> 3440.1600000000003
immediately

3438.4 --> 3444.839
so they just knew

3440.16 --> 3444.839
they knew that something was happening

3466.559 --> 3471.0400000000004
there i've looked learned to look both

3468.559 --> 3472.2400000000002
ways before crossing that is

3471.04 --> 3475.64
cool

3472.24 --> 3475.64
that's great

3481.28 --> 3485.76
now if only other animals would do the

3483.44 --> 3485.76
same

3486.88 --> 3491.28
i mean a lot of animals are just really

3489.28 --> 3493.599
afraid of the road and they're just like

3491.28 --> 3495.3590000000004
trying to slip through

3493.599 --> 3498.4
they don't even understand that there is

3495.359 --> 3500.0789999999997
like a specific timing to everything

3498.4 --> 3502.799
they just think they're really large

3500.079 --> 3504.88
animals and sometimes the large animals

3502.799 --> 3507.359
just snatches you that's what they think

3504.88 --> 3508.96
about cars on the road

3507.359 --> 3512.52
they don't understand that they're not

3508.96 --> 3512.52
animals hunting

3518.0 --> 3522.16
oh thank you insanity sanity thank you

3520.48 --> 3524.559
for the five pound super chat donation

3522.16 --> 3526.799
have a beer

3524.559 --> 3529.3590000000004
not a bear yeah i will thank you uh for

3526.799 --> 3530.799
that i win the bear king am i a bear

3529.359 --> 3532.96
king though

3530.799 --> 3535.2
if i'm a bear king i'm really small for

3532.96 --> 3537.359
a bear king i would not want to take

3535.2 --> 3540.3999999999996
that title i mean owen benjamin

3537.359 --> 3545.0
definitely has that title

3540.4 --> 3545.0
the great white bear

3551.44 --> 3554.88
besides i'm more of a grizzly type

3553.68 --> 3558.5989999999997
anyway

3554.88 --> 3558.599
small and vicious

3562.64 --> 3566.4
i chop roll up in the ball when they see

3564.799 --> 3568.4
your car yeah

3566.4 --> 3570.559
so tragic when that happens gadget

3568.4 --> 3574.079
inspector

3570.559 --> 3577.52
i mean that yeah because that works

3574.079 --> 3580.48
you know with big animals it's like oh

3577.52 --> 3582.559
a giant panthers coming hedgehog roll up

3580.48 --> 3584.64
because yeah that's what you do

3582.559 --> 3587.6400000000003
they don't understand it's just a thing

3584.64 --> 3587.64
that's

3589.76 --> 3595.599
i mean i wonder if like a hedgehog

3593.28 --> 3597.2000000000003
would roll up too

3595.599 --> 3601.28
if there was like a path that's

3597.2 --> 3602.799
constantly being walked by rhinos

3601.28 --> 3606.1600000000003
right because i'm pretty sure that a

3602.799 --> 3608.319
rhino would potentially crush a hedgehog

3606.16 --> 3609.92
just as much as a car would

3608.319 --> 3611.119
i mean those creatures are freaking

3609.92 --> 3614.119
heavy

3611.119 --> 3614.119
right

3622.96 --> 3627.559
can't bear it what do you what do you

3624.559 --> 3627.559
mean

3638.319 --> 3641.319
um

3666.799 --> 3671.839
and those deer hit your car they cause

3668.88 --> 3671.839
massive yeah

3672.559 --> 3675.0400000000004
of course

3682.96 --> 3690.48
no going to amsterdam okay cool but i am

3686.88 --> 3690.48
not going to amsterdam though

3692.319 --> 3696.64
but hey if you want to come and visit me

3694.72 --> 3699.2799999999997
sure why not

3696.64 --> 3702.24
but i'm not going anywhere

3699.28 --> 3704.2400000000002
i live in utrecht utrecht

3702.24 --> 3706.72
which is

3704.24 --> 3710.24
like a 20 to

3706.72 --> 3712.9599999999996
30 minute train ride from amsterdam

3710.24 --> 3716.16
it's very close well everything is very

3712.96 --> 3718.319
close in the netherlands of course but

3716.16 --> 3719.92
you know where that is good

3718.319 --> 3722.319
i mean it's like

3719.92 --> 3724.799
the one of the biggest

3722.319 --> 3728.24
cities in central netherlands so yeah

3724.799 --> 3728.24
it's not that hard to find

3732.4 --> 3736.7200000000003
i used to live in naimeh

3734.4 --> 3736.7200000000003
really

3737.52 --> 3740.52
huh

3750.96 --> 3753.96
hmm

3754.079 --> 3756.4
okay

3757.76 --> 3764.96
now that's a strange ass city by the way

3762.319 --> 3767.96
it's a lot of weirdness going on in my

3764.96 --> 3767.96
nation

3768.64 --> 3774.96
and i mean it's really a strange place

3772.799 --> 3777.68
there's like a really unusual energy

3774.96 --> 3779.28
there there's all kinds of weird occult

3777.68 --> 3780.839
things

3779.28 --> 3784.96
creepy

3780.839 --> 3784.96
groups hanging around there

3786.88 --> 3792.6400000000003
it's a strange city

3790.16 --> 3794.839
like even if you just look at the layout

3792.64 --> 3798.24
of it all it's very

3794.839 --> 3801.7599999999998
strange like it doesn't feel like other

3798.24 --> 3801.7599999999998
typical cities in the netherlands

3810.96 --> 3813.52
yeah that's

3814.559 --> 3818.7200000000003
was quite depressing there yeah i

3816.319 --> 3820.72
wouldn't want to live there either

3818.72 --> 3822.3999999999996
but i have been there a lot i mean my ex

3820.72 --> 3825.1189999999997
used to live there so i went back and

3822.4 --> 3826.4
forth there a lot my brother and his

3825.119 --> 3828.6400000000003
family

3826.4 --> 3830.96
his kids and all that lived there i

3828.64 --> 3833.2
think they still live there

3830.96 --> 3835.28
they bought a house there so

3833.2 --> 3837.1189999999997
i mean it is really beautiful and green

3835.28 --> 3840.3190000000004
but it's also

3837.119 --> 3841.359
weird and there's like creepy occult

3840.319 --> 3844.92
[ __ ]

3841.359 --> 3844.92

3863.599 --> 3869.92
all right well i didn't move there

3866.64 --> 3872.8799999999997
like we moved together to the south

3869.92 --> 3872.88
in a hormone

3873.039 --> 3876.48
in

3873.839 --> 3876.48
lindor

3909.76 --> 3913.6800000000003
smoke i mean i'm up for that

3920.72 --> 3926.9599999999996
but yeah tell me in advance though

3924.079 --> 3928.799
don't just suddenly unexpectedly be at

3926.96 --> 3930.48
my doorstep that

3928.799 --> 3933.0389999999998
that is

3930.48 --> 3937.839
i'd still do it but it's still like yeah

3933.039 --> 3937.8390000000004
it can kind of confuse me in my day

3938.72 --> 3941.7599999999998
i just need

3940.079 --> 3943.92
if there's if something out of the

3941.76 --> 3947.119
ordinary is gonna happen it helps a lot

3943.92 --> 3950.6800000000003
if i get some mental preparation time

3947.119 --> 3950.6800000000003
at least a day

3954.4 --> 3959.0
right yeah

3955.76 --> 3959.0
just saying

3964.319 --> 3970.16
yeah pjc net i know

3966.72 --> 3973.359
i mean it is a really beautiful city

3970.16 --> 3976.3999999999996
it's extremely green they're all really

3973.359 --> 3976.4
green but

3976.559 --> 3980.6400000000003
there is issues

3978.48 --> 3984.4
there's like some really

3980.64 --> 3984.4
liberal nut cases that are there

3984.64 --> 3989.5989999999997
and there's like

3987.28 --> 3989.599
yeah

3990.96 --> 3995.359
there's just a lot of weird [ __ ] going

3992.799 --> 3995.359
on in there

4005.039 --> 4011.119
but it is very beautiful

4008.64 --> 4014.92
a lot of green and surrounded by

4011.119 --> 4014.92
forest pretty much

4029.52 --> 4033.28
stare where else

4031.44 --> 4036.0
stare wells

4033.28 --> 4039.7200000000003
you mean stairways

4036.0 --> 4039.72
what are you talking about

4062.16 --> 4066.5589999999997
i think i know what you're talking about

4063.76 --> 4069.28
fluttershave some of those

4066.559 --> 4073.28
yeah it's it's water-formed

4069.28 --> 4073.28
almost artificial staircases

4075.44 --> 4080.2400000000002
but that happens that happens naturally

4078.0 --> 4083.2
in a lot of places

4080.24 --> 4085.5989999999997
i've never had any like horrible

4083.2 --> 4089.2
experience of like walking up them and

4085.599 --> 4089.2000000000003
then feeling cursed or something

4089.76 --> 4092.2400000000002
wooden stairs

4091.28 --> 4094.48
what

4092.24 --> 4096.239
yeah but it's roots you see rig back

4094.48 --> 4097.6
it's roots

4096.239 --> 4100.919999999999
sure it's wooden

4097.6 --> 4100.92
there's roots

4104.48 --> 4110.639999999999
like from a house

4106.799 --> 4114.679
okay now you just completely lost me

4110.64 --> 4114.679
what are you talking about

4126.96 --> 4131.44
just woods well flatter sage have you

4129.12 --> 4135.599999999999
ever considered that people might have

4131.44 --> 4138.0
just chosen to install them

4135.6 --> 4142.4400000000005
maybe even off record

4138.0 --> 4142.44
just for the aesthetics of it

4160.56 --> 4165.04
oh all right gordzilla 37 thanks for

4163.92 --> 4168.2390000000005
being here

4165.04 --> 4168.239
i'll see you at fed

4172.08 --> 4177.5199999999995
there these were buried deep inside

4175.04 --> 4177.5199999999995
yellows

4180.0 --> 4185.12
okay

4182.08 --> 4187.44
so as anybody then if that if that's

4185.12 --> 4190.48
what you're talking about

4187.44 --> 4191.678999999999
anybody dated the wood i mean you can

4190.48 --> 4193.759
date wood

4191.679 --> 4196.4
actually it's one of the few things you

4193.759 --> 4198.8
can actually date

4196.4 --> 4198.799999999999
you know

4199.199 --> 4202.199
so

4205.52 --> 4210.719
right maybe

4207.679 --> 4213.6
indians had some sort of like temple

4210.719 --> 4215.44
thing at yellowstone or something

4213.6 --> 4217.52
and they needed the staircase who knows

4215.44 --> 4220.48
man maybe they just

4217.52 --> 4222.88
maybe they just threw sacrifice victims

4220.48 --> 4224.5599999999995
into the yellowstone puddles or

4222.88 --> 4227.6
something

4224.56 --> 4227.6
who knows

4227.76 --> 4231.84
sounds really ridiculous by the way

4230.0 --> 4234.719
probably not but maybe they had some

4231.84 --> 4236.719
sort of inca thing going on

4234.719 --> 4237.679
who knows

4236.719 --> 4240.32
could be

4237.679 --> 4240.32
archaic

4242.0 --> 4247.12
what they disappeared okay

4246.0 --> 4251.719
sure

4247.12 --> 4251.719
they disappeared of course

4290.32 --> 4293.32
hmm

4302.96 --> 4305.76
that is weird

4309.36 --> 4312.799999999999
well whatever

4311.199 --> 4314.4
it is there for

4312.8 --> 4316.8
i think it's just

4314.4 --> 4318.48
being built by people

4316.8 --> 4320.719
maybe they're just nature fans and

4318.48 --> 4323.919999999999
they're just like yeah we're just gonna

4320.719 --> 4326.32
mysteriously build this stuff here

4323.92 --> 4329.6
maybe they had some budget for nature

4326.32 --> 4331.92
improvement who knows man who knows what

4329.6 --> 4331.92
it is

4340.719 --> 4345.199
wait are you complaining again rick back

4354.56 --> 4359.6
you feel that i'm targeting you

4357.199 --> 4364.04
i'm not

4359.6 --> 4364.04
you are blabbering on about it

4376.64 --> 4380.320000000001
all right yeah you see that people are

4378.4 --> 4382.08
obviously making them so why do they

4380.32 --> 4383.92
make them

4382.08 --> 4386.4
maybe because they're freaking bored and

4383.92 --> 4388.56
they want to do it maybe they think it's

4386.4 --> 4390.719
like better for nature and just if

4388.56 --> 4393.6
people that happen to travel there see a

4390.719 --> 4395.92
staircase they'll just use the staircase

4393.6 --> 4398.2390000000005
instead of like threading on the

4395.92 --> 4400.56
wild ground and that might spare the

4398.239 --> 4402.718999999999
wild ground right

4400.56 --> 4405.76
maybe that's why they did it

4402.719 --> 4408.64
who knows but it's probably

4405.76 --> 4409.84
like semi-related to some hippie groups

4408.64 --> 4411.280000000001
or something

4409.84 --> 4415.04
or some

4411.28 --> 4417.28
wildlife preserving foundation maybe

4415.04 --> 4421.56
maybe they've done it

4417.28 --> 4421.5599999999995
it's some sort of secret project

4429.28 --> 4434.0
or yeah maybe it is just people that are

4432.08 --> 4435.76
bored maybe they're just trying to

4434.0 --> 4437.6
create a new mystery

4435.76 --> 4439.4400000000005
like ooh build these mysterious

4437.6 --> 4440.400000000001
staircases and they know exactly who

4439.44 --> 4442.719
built them

4440.4 --> 4444.719
they just want it to be a mystery to

4442.719 --> 4446.32
baffle people

4444.719 --> 4450.2390000000005
maybe that's the reason maybe they're

4446.32 --> 4450.239
literally just mind-grappling people

4450.48 --> 4453.639999999999
who knows

4464.4 --> 4470.08
no disturbance in the area no

4466.84 --> 4470.08
rubble yeah

4471.6 --> 4473.84
so

4476.8 --> 4481.719
i mean why would they leave the rubble

4484.239 --> 4489.199
i take the rubble with me but hey it

4487.199 --> 4490.96
might be interesting to look at the

4489.199 --> 4492.879999999999
staircases how are these build do they

4490.96 --> 4495.199
have like screws

4492.88 --> 4498.159000000001
and then see hey

4495.199 --> 4501.04
metal detector perhaps is there any

4498.159 --> 4502.239
loose screw around here which would be a

4501.04 --> 4503.92
sign that

4502.239 --> 4506.48
they would have cleaned up but might

4503.92 --> 4508.0
have lost sight on a screw and then it's

4506.48 --> 4510.879999999999
still around

4508.0 --> 4514.32
dude

4510.88 --> 4514.32
i don't know why i'm getting into this

4522.159 --> 4527.36
big things supposed to happen when you

4524.48 --> 4527.36
go up them

4527.52 --> 4530.52
why

4550.64 --> 4556.159000000001
and here's another one

4552.8 --> 4558.400000000001
if people literally like get cursed and

4556.159 --> 4560.159
[ __ ] from walking up that and their life

4558.4 --> 4561.5199999999995
is [ __ ]

4560.159 --> 4563.5199999999995
why the hell don't you take the

4561.52 --> 4565.6
staircases down then

4563.52 --> 4569.1990000000005
i mean if they're literally cursed why

4565.6 --> 4571.52
would you leave a cursed item

4569.199 --> 4573.199
like that why

4571.52 --> 4574.96
why wouldn't you just

4573.199 --> 4578.678999999999
take it down and why the hell did my

4574.96 --> 4578.679
camera freeze again

4634.0 --> 4637.199
what are you talking about i have no

4635.44 --> 4641.04
idea what you're talking about all

4637.199 --> 4641.04
lights what the hell does that mean

4641.44 --> 4647.0
what is a missing 4-1-1 what is that

4677.84 --> 4679.92
you

4718.0 --> 4723.52
okay right back does that happen a lot

4721.6 --> 4726.08
people continually

4723.52 --> 4729.92
like go missing when they enter national

4726.08 --> 4730.8
parks does that happen continually

4729.92 --> 4734.52
i mean

4730.8 --> 4734.52
what are you talking about

4742.239 --> 4747.5199999999995
oh it's bad yes okay well my conclusion

4744.8 --> 4750.719
is is that there's a secret complex with

4747.52 --> 4752.96
humans that literally snatch people then

4750.719 --> 4756.0
if that's the case

4752.96 --> 4758.96
i mean that cannot be something else

4756.0 --> 4761.04
then if people on a regular basis go

4758.96 --> 4763.679
missing there that means they're being

4761.04 --> 4765.28
snatched by other people

4763.679 --> 4767.52
and there's probably a secret

4765.28 --> 4768.96
underground complex then there

4767.52 --> 4771.280000000001
who knows what the hell they're doing

4768.96 --> 4771.28
with it

4771.44 --> 4778.32
but that would be my

4774.32 --> 4778.32
pretty solid conclusion for that

4779.36 --> 4785.48
people go missing it's usually because

4781.92 --> 4785.4800000000005
of other people

4791.199 --> 4795.839999999999
right so oh it might be something else

4793.28 --> 4800.159
yeah or it's just [ __ ] people like

4795.84 --> 4802.88
always in every single case okay

4800.159 --> 4806.08
99.999

4802.88 --> 4808.639
of the time that people go missing

4806.08 --> 4811.04
or end up dead it's because of other

4808.639 --> 4811.04
people

4811.6 --> 4816.159000000001
don't go on a stupid rabbit trail about

4813.92 --> 4819.1990000000005
some mysterious thing that is causing it

4816.159 --> 4823.4
when it is blatantly people if it's

4819.199 --> 4823.4
really that regular thing

4836.719 --> 4842.2390000000005
people disappear while talking to

4839.36 --> 4845.239
someone right next to them

4842.239 --> 4845.239
right

4847.04 --> 4851.84
sorry i just don't believe that

4849.44 --> 4851.839999999999
at all

4852.08 --> 4855.679
sounds like horror [ __ ] to me

4858.8 --> 4862.639
is there any video evidence for that

4869.84 --> 4874.4800000000005
i mean people love to make up [ __ ]

4872.48 --> 4877.48
stories even when it's incredibly

4874.48 --> 4877.48
inappropriate

4904.56 --> 4908.88
can easily be fake with someone

4906.32 --> 4911.199
vanishing yes unless they have been

4908.88 --> 4912.4800000000005
officially reported as missing to the

4911.199 --> 4914.5599999999995
police

4912.48 --> 4918.638999999999
pj cnet

4914.56 --> 4918.639
and then that video evidence is

4921.52 --> 4925.1990000000005
that's a different story then i mean if

4923.199 --> 4926.5599999999995
people go missing that's not just oh he

4925.199 --> 4930.719
went missing

4926.56 --> 4934.0
that's it no if somebody goes missing

4930.719 --> 4935.76
then they go missing

4934.0 --> 4938.0
and then there's something amiss and

4935.76 --> 4939.4400000000005
then it gets registered like lost

4938.0 --> 4940.56
they're lost

4939.44 --> 4943.199
right

4940.56 --> 4944.96
if it's a scam if it's faked

4943.199 --> 4947.759999999999
that nobody's going to be reported to

4944.96 --> 4951.2390000000005
the police as missing

4947.76 --> 4951.2390000000005
it's that simple

4977.199 --> 4980.08
yep

4978.4 --> 4983.28
sorry just

4980.08 --> 4986.159
my immediate conclusion and so solid one

4983.28 --> 4988.08
is that there is a secret complex

4986.159 --> 4990.48
in these national parks and might even

4988.08 --> 4992.32
be entire tunnel networks how would you

4990.48 --> 4996.32
know unless you literally

4992.32 --> 4996.32
are able to deep scan the ground

4996.48 --> 5000.199
military style

5011.76 --> 5014.76
what

5019.679 --> 5025.6
okay that's just nutty

5022.639 --> 5028.96
and i don't believe it

5025.6 --> 5031.120000000001
i think the ability for people to make

5028.96 --> 5033.84
up stupid [ __ ]

5031.12 --> 5035.679
is thousands of times higher than

5033.84 --> 5037.1990000000005
anything super surreal actually

5035.679 --> 5038.719
happening

5037.199 --> 5041.04
i mean

5038.719 --> 5046.4
if that was real

5041.04 --> 5046.4
i would never even talk about that ever

5046.88 --> 5050.719
yeah

5048.719 --> 5054.639
i mean

5050.719 --> 5057.36
seriously how are you gonna justify that

5054.639 --> 5059.76
if that was actually real

5057.36 --> 5062.799999999999
i would keep it to myself and not tell a

5059.76 --> 5066.320000000001
soul because it's really [ __ ] scary

5062.8 --> 5068.0
your kid just displaced out of nowhere

5066.32 --> 5070.639
what you're gonna say oh just disappear

5068.0 --> 5074.0
it's a magical thing oh you want to lose

5070.639 --> 5076.08
your kid you want gps to go

5074.0 --> 5078.08
cbs to come to your house and take it

5076.08 --> 5080.239
because you're [ __ ] insane

5078.08 --> 5081.76
and you lost your kid

5080.239 --> 5083.28
for a long time in the middle of the

5081.76 --> 5085.92
wilderness

5083.28 --> 5086.88
yeah no i'm not gonna talk about that

5085.92 --> 5088.719
then

5086.88 --> 5092.32
it's ridiculous

5088.719 --> 5095.32
so it almost has to be made up

5092.32 --> 5095.32
[ __ ]

5105.44 --> 5110.0
yeah

5106.639 --> 5112.0
hundreds of miles away finding them

5110.0 --> 5115.36
really

5112.0 --> 5118.88
this sounds like a total horse

5115.36 --> 5118.88
[ __ ] story

5123.679 --> 5126.2390000000005
right

5124.639 --> 5127.76
but who knows maybe there is a freaking

5126.239 --> 5129.839999999999
tunnel network maybe they got a whole

5127.76 --> 5132.08
complex underneath there and that's why

5129.84 --> 5134.0
the boss tells the rangers not to talk

5132.08 --> 5135.6
about the weird missing

5134.0 --> 5137.6
[ __ ]

5135.6 --> 5140.2390000000005
because they might have like just like

5137.6 --> 5142.719
with disneyland build an entire tunnel

5140.239 --> 5146.4
network underneath everything that

5142.719 --> 5146.4
people don't even know is there

5152.239 --> 5155.839999999999
hello the goods

5162.48 --> 5169.44
not see ufos or some [ __ ] yeah yeah or

5165.84 --> 5173.4400000000005
it's just people making [ __ ] up

5169.44 --> 5175.12
and perhaps some freaky human smuggling

5173.44 --> 5177.36
and

5175.12 --> 5178.639
who knows what else they do in dungeons

5177.36 --> 5181.12
or something

5178.639 --> 5185.4800000000005
underneath the parks

5181.12 --> 5185.48
i mean for [ __ ] sake

5196.8 --> 5203.28
no it doesn't moon guys

5200.4 --> 5205.679
i appreciate you attempting to bring up

5203.28 --> 5208.48
some connection to the looping model but

5205.679 --> 5211.4400000000005
has not a [ __ ] thing to do with

5208.48 --> 5215.599999999999
anything we're talking about here yeah

5211.44 --> 5218.799999999999
looping is looping looping means the

5215.6 --> 5223.120000000001
entirety of available space

5218.8 --> 5225.12
how it interconnects to itself not oh

5223.12 --> 5227.28
well there's a looping realm so that

5225.12 --> 5231.679
means you have poured over there look

5227.28 --> 5231.679
i'll be here and i'm there oh no

5232.0 --> 5236.48
not like that at all

5234.639 --> 5240.0
nothing to do with that

5236.48 --> 5240.919999999999
there's nothing to do with portals

5240.0 --> 5244.719
or

5240.92 --> 5249.84
displacing over vast distances has

5244.719 --> 5253.84
nothing whatsoever to do with looping

5249.84 --> 5253.84
from the rectangular looping model

5286.0 --> 5290.08
it's very simple teleportation doesn't

5288.96 --> 5292.639
exist

5290.08 --> 5297.44
never existed never will exist

5292.639 --> 5298.4800000000005
teleportation is a really really [ __ ]

5297.44 --> 5302.08
dumb

5298.48 --> 5304.5599999999995
science fiction idea really [ __ ] dumb

5302.08 --> 5306.719
like beyond [ __ ]

5304.56 --> 5309.1990000000005
it's an early stage

5306.719 --> 5311.04
dumbass science fiction thing that got

5309.199 --> 5314.48
in why

5311.04 --> 5317.5199999999995
because of theatrics because it's so

5314.48 --> 5320.0
easy for the theatrics that's the reason

5317.52 --> 5323.120000000001
why [ __ ] teleportation was even

5320.0 --> 5327.04
popularized in science fiction purely

5323.12 --> 5328.88
for the cheap cheap cheap

5327.04 --> 5329.76
theatrics of it

5328.88 --> 5332.2390000000005
yeah

5329.76 --> 5335.12
that's the reason why teleportation is

5332.239 --> 5337.199
popularized in reality it is the most

5335.12 --> 5341.32
[ __ ] science fiction concept

5337.199 --> 5341.32
humanity's ever devised

5352.08 --> 5357.12
oh is a looping realm flat

5354.32 --> 5360.5599999999995
how isn't it flat how does looping

5357.12 --> 5360.5599999999995
relate to flat

5360.719 --> 5367.36
how does your question make any sense

5365.04 --> 5367.36
i mean

5368.8 --> 5374.159000000001
how does

5371.04 --> 5377.32
a chair relate to an orange

5374.159 --> 5377.32
you know

5396.32 --> 5402.4
wow you once spoke to somebody that

5398.4 --> 5405.12
claimed something ridiculous huh

5402.4 --> 5407.679
some things never change do they yeah

5405.12 --> 5409.4
i've bumped in a whole bunch of people

5407.679 --> 5412.8
that reclaiming

5409.4 --> 5416.239
ridiculous things

5412.8 --> 5418.719
me too bumped into many of them yeah one

5416.239 --> 5423.919999999999
thing i never ever did

5418.719 --> 5423.92
was actually believe that [ __ ]

5424.8 --> 5430.159000000001
if you don't have any proof

5427.679 --> 5431.6
then it's [ __ ]

5430.159 --> 5434.799999999999
yeah

5431.6 --> 5437.76
and that's talking about actual

5434.8 --> 5438.88
claimed experiences things you've done

5437.76 --> 5441.84
and seen

5438.88 --> 5444.719
oh you have no proof yeah whatever then

5441.84 --> 5444.719
i don't give a [ __ ]

5447.36 --> 5452.759999999999
lupus no you don't know what the hell

5449.199 --> 5452.759999999999
you're talking about

5462.639 --> 5466.76
let's get out of here

5512.719 --> 5518.4
why are you complaining again rig back

5516.0 --> 5521.44
and why don't you actually just write

5518.4 --> 5523.36
down a cohesive sentence that starts

5521.44 --> 5525.678999999999
with a capital letter like all normal

5523.36 --> 5525.679
people

5530.88 --> 5536.719
short fuse day for you okay

5534.0 --> 5538.96
well be careful then

5536.719 --> 5538.96
because

5539.44 --> 5544.4
i do like fuses that's what i do

5542.56 --> 5546.56
if you're gonna be complaining i'm gonna

5544.4 --> 5549.599999999999
push

5546.56 --> 5552.0
right so you feel kind of sick sickly or

5549.6 --> 5554.719
easily triggered then you just might

5552.0 --> 5556.96
want to take a few steps back and just

5554.719 --> 5556.96
not

5557.52 --> 5561.84
not get involved too much then

5563.28 --> 5569.44
trying to talk p show yeah well

5567.199 --> 5572.239
i think that

5569.44 --> 5575.839999999999
being reserved is the best method to

5572.239 --> 5575.839999999999
actually achieve it

5589.52 --> 5593.8
he blabbering about rick henry

5616.08 --> 5619.239
right here

5635.12 --> 5639.12
great

5636.88 --> 5640.4800000000005
one of my neighbors is playing at bass

5639.12 --> 5644.599999999999
guitar

5640.48 --> 5644.599999999999
that's what i'm hearing yeah

5652.4 --> 5657.12
let's talk about sub photonics okay well

5654.8 --> 5659.28
what's there to talk about really other

5657.12 --> 5663.44
than it yeah

5659.28 --> 5663.44
pointing it out as a potential

5664.96 --> 5670.2390000000005
technology to be exploited

5668.32 --> 5671.84
bass guitar cool yeah it's all really

5670.239 --> 5674.08
cool except when somebody doesn't

5671.84 --> 5676.08
actually know how to play it

5674.08 --> 5678.48
let's put it on the speaker and then i

5676.08 --> 5682.76
can hear the vibrations that's going

5678.48 --> 5682.759999999999
through the wall not so cool

5798.239 --> 5802.718999999999
scratching your nose with your leprosy

5800.719 --> 5804.8
and all

5802.719 --> 5807.6
how do you feel if i just said that you

5804.8 --> 5809.1990000000005
actually have leprosy gadget inspector i

5807.6 --> 5812.0
mean you might want to be careful with

5809.199 --> 5815.04
that the [ __ ] are you talking about

5812.0 --> 5818.0
nicotine scratching

5815.04 --> 5819.679
it's [ __ ] it's hot in here i don't

5818.0 --> 5823.44
i'm not even wearing a shirt because

5819.679 --> 5825.6
it's hot and i'm rubbing the sweat off

5823.44 --> 5828.48
my head

5825.6 --> 5831.4800000000005
yeah don't talk to me like that again

5828.48 --> 5831.48
ever

5871.119 --> 5875.759999999999
gets itchy himself when he needs to

5872.96 --> 5879.92
smoke well that's really sad for him

5875.76 --> 5879.92
yeah that doesn't apply to me

5880.56 --> 5886.96
because i'm not nicotine addicted

5884.719 --> 5886.96
see

5892.239 --> 5897.119
in a sense well

5894.4 --> 5899.679
maybe if i'd be like a week without it i

5897.119 --> 5900.88
might get some real like nervous

5899.679 --> 5902.88
issues

5900.88 --> 5906.32
because of that

5902.88 --> 5909.04
but i don't smoke all day like a [ __ ]

5906.32 --> 5910.799999999999
sorry if you're really smoking addicted

5909.04 --> 5913.679
it can happen to you

5910.8 --> 5915.4400000000005
i've made sure that that never happens

5913.679 --> 5917.36
to me

5915.44 --> 5919.5199999999995
made sure to that that that would never

5917.36 --> 5921.44
happen to me when i was young

5919.52 --> 5923.679
and i make sure it never happens to me

5921.44 --> 5925.919999999999
now

5923.679 --> 5928.0
i feel really insulted for a remark like

5925.92 --> 5931.159
that like i would allow that to happen

5928.0 --> 5931.159
to me

5941.119 --> 5944.88
it's probably the last two days of heat

5943.04 --> 5947.199
this year yeah that's what they said the

5944.88 --> 5949.36
last week

5947.199 --> 5950.638999999999
sure

5949.36 --> 5953.28
yeah or

5950.639 --> 5954.2390000000005
it's gonna stay really nice in summer

5953.28 --> 5955.119
heat

5954.239 --> 5958.4
like

5955.119 --> 5958.4
until mid-september

5959.28 --> 5963.48
that could happen just as well

5970.159 --> 5972.879999999999
four more weeks yeah

5971.84 --> 5975.360000000001
maybe

5972.88 --> 5975.36
we'll see

5975.6 --> 5979.6
i think that there's a weather

5977.44 --> 5981.28
oscillation and the seasons are split

5979.6 --> 5984.96
into

5981.28 --> 5987.759999999999
both winter and summer

5984.96 --> 5991.36
so summer starts earlier

5987.76 --> 5995.52
doesn't have as extreme a middle peak

5991.36 --> 5999.159
and ends later and so does winter

5995.52 --> 5999.159000000001
that's what i think

6009.28 --> 6012.639
right and i'm gonna round out the show

6011.36 --> 6014.799999999999
so

6012.639 --> 6016.639
yeah gadgets factor you're not banned by

6014.8 --> 6019.119000000001
the way i just timed you out don't do

6016.639 --> 6020.84
that again though

6019.119 --> 6024.4
like

6020.84 --> 6026.88
don't don't yeah that is like

6024.4 --> 6028.5599999999995
and rick henry said that is effectively

6026.88 --> 6030.639
trying to get under my skin that's what

6028.56 --> 6033.4400000000005
you were doing right there it's not

6030.639 --> 6035.28
acceptable you're not gonna talk me into

6033.44 --> 6038.638999999999
some kind of

6035.28 --> 6040.96
oh no medical scare for myself i know

6038.639 --> 6043.52
exactly how i work

6040.96 --> 6046.56
and i never get

6043.52 --> 6048.84
nicotine withdrawal symptoms i've never

6046.56 --> 6051.52
had that

6048.84 --> 6053.52
like except in the time when i wasn't

6051.52 --> 6055.76
smoking cannabis and i smoked more

6053.52 --> 6059.52
regular cigarettes and all that

6055.76 --> 6061.119000000001
that would have been in around 2006 2008

6059.52 --> 6063.119000000001
back then

6061.119 --> 6066.159
i smoked a lot

6063.119 --> 6068.4
more compared to well

6066.159 --> 6070.239
right after that because i didn't hold

6068.4 --> 6072.0
on to that habit i felt like this is

6070.239 --> 6076.32
gonna literally just

6072.0 --> 6076.32
disintegrate my body if i keep this up

6076.4 --> 6080.32
it was kind of enjoyable at the time

6083.6 --> 6087.679
and yeah if then i would have ran out i

6085.76 --> 6088.88
would have had nicotine withdrawal back

6087.679 --> 6089.92
then

6088.88 --> 6095.1990000000005
yeah

6089.92 --> 6095.1990000000005
but i've ensured to just not have that

6095.76 --> 6100.88
i was like i'm not gonna be a freaking

6098.48 --> 6104.759999999999
nicotine addict for the rest of my life

6100.88 --> 6104.76
it's not that great

6108.159 --> 6112.0
for my age you look wonderful thank you

6109.84 --> 6113.52
neil degrasse tyson lies that's that's

6112.0 --> 6115.92
nice thing to say

6113.52 --> 6117.92
i i'd like to think so

6115.92 --> 6121.679
and in a way i hope so because i still

6117.92 --> 6123.6
kind of want to have kids

6121.679 --> 6125.52
and

6123.6 --> 6126.639
yeah

6125.52 --> 6130.320000000001
you know

6126.639 --> 6130.32
right but i'm gonna run out the show

6130.4 --> 6135.44
kind of a messy show

6133.28 --> 6136.719
talking a lot about bears in the woods

6135.44 --> 6138.0
and

6136.719 --> 6140.639
and then the woods and people

6138.0 --> 6142.719
disappearing in it apparently

6140.639 --> 6144.32
which

6142.719 --> 6145.28
is

6144.32 --> 6147.84
just

6145.28 --> 6151.599999999999
not because of supernatural issues i

6147.84 --> 6154.56
don't believe that at all

6151.6 --> 6157.1990000000005
like i really don't believe that

6154.56 --> 6160.0
but there could be all kinds of things

6157.199 --> 6163.5199999999995
so oh oh parks so people disappeared oh

6160.0 --> 6165.36
well scan the [ __ ] ground then

6163.52 --> 6169.1990000000005
hurry up

6165.36 --> 6171.759999999999
scan the ground then people disappear

6169.199 --> 6173.599999999999
scan the ground

6171.76 --> 6175.280000000001
scan it for tunnels

6173.6 --> 6177.280000000001
scan it for

6175.28 --> 6179.44
exhaust

6177.28 --> 6181.5199999999995
right if there's an underground complex

6181.52 --> 6186.400000000001
so find it

6183.6 --> 6189.360000000001

6186.4 --> 6192.159
scan the ground find it stop talking

6189.36 --> 6194.799999999999
