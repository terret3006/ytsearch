morning guys thing else today enough

71.27 --> 78.36
yeah nothing like yesterday it's all

74.22 --> 81.45
great any dreary it's actually pretty

78.36 --> 85.35
much constantly raining now very typical

81.45 --> 88.97
it's Wednesday of course so that usually

85.35 --> 91.58999999999999
happens and they wonder if again today

88.97 --> 93.96
just when I'm about to go and do my

91.59 --> 98.64
newspaper round it'll actually start to

93.96 --> 100.94999999999999
dry up because for some reason this

98.64 --> 105.27
seems to be happening a lot on

100.95 --> 108.81
Wednesdays but I never really get wet

105.27 --> 111.24
for some reason anyway yeah let's use in

108.81 --> 114.36
chat a lot of chat activity sorry for

111.24 --> 116.53999999999999
being a little bit late yeah it's also

114.36 --> 120.96
because of the moist it sounds weird but

116.54 --> 125.79
usually I smoke a joint like right

120.96 --> 129.599
before because I like to be in the zone

125.79 --> 131.459
when I do the intro but yeah that makes

129.599 --> 136.92
me it when it's sunny

131.459 --> 138.84
I smoke really quickly ok but when

136.92 --> 143.01
there's moist in the air that doesn't

138.84 --> 144.93
work the same so I just like ok if I'm

143.01 --> 147.47
gonna smoke this really quickly then I'm

144.93 --> 149.84900000000002
just gonna get all dizzy and [ __ ] so

147.47 --> 152.459
yeah it took me a little bit longer than

149.849 --> 155.459
I expected anyway that's the reason why

152.459 --> 158.97
I'm late it's a silly reason let's use

155.459 --> 163.35
in chat AGM was there first an Amanda

158.97 --> 166.76
young stone monkey 3d Miguel Barbosa

163.35 --> 175.459
Jason McCormack Randy flattered

166.76 --> 175.459
moo-coo Steve plain truth

175.58 --> 183.72000000000003
the peanuts Clark with a penguin and hat

181.489 --> 187.68
rights matrix media

183.72 --> 194.819
I killed the hope truth flesh I always

187.68 --> 195.56
do this Trish bliss wing yeah good to

194.819 --> 200.51
see you all

195.56 --> 200.51
flatout faith good morning

209.35 --> 219.37
yeah you shouldn't really smoke in the

211.67 --> 223.36999999999998
morning anyway actually I have been

219.37 --> 227.12
smoking pretty steadily and I really

223.37 --> 229.49
feel like I should be like trying to

227.12 --> 233.51
completely cut it off just to get

229.49 --> 235.79000000000002
another pause and I haven't surprisingly

233.51 --> 238.73
because I really kind of had the signs

235.79 --> 245.18
even months back and I kind of didn't do

238.73 --> 248.48
it then I got sick still didn't do it so

245.18 --> 252.23000000000002
I wonder like okay is this is this okay

248.48 --> 255.85999999999999
I have smoked like on a daily basis for

252.23 --> 258.19
years on end in the past but I'm a

255.86 --> 266.96000000000004
little bit older now so I don't know I

258.19 --> 270.29
still do enjoy it though but really I

266.96 --> 274.43
start to wonder sometimes wouldn't it be

270.29 --> 279.89000000000004
better to just have a more constructive

274.43 --> 282.86
thing to do because it brings me in the

279.89 --> 286.669
zone right that that is like a function

282.86 --> 289.13
it does with me it mellows me out but

286.669 --> 291.919
when it comes to like individual things

289.13 --> 294.89
when I'm just on my own like way in the

291.919 --> 299.77
past I used to kind of like smoke and

294.89 --> 302.9
then I get so well so imagination DUP

299.77 --> 304.96999999999997
that I then just start to see things in

302.9 --> 307.60999999999996
my mind and then start drawing them and

304.97 --> 311.36
that worked really well but that's gone

307.61 --> 313.72
away like after 10 years or something it

311.36 --> 317.15000000000003
like became less and less and less and

313.72 --> 319.37
so I'm not having that and the funny

317.15 --> 322.60999999999996
thing is even that sometimes in the

319.37 --> 327.56
periods that I then take a long pause it

322.61 --> 330.07
actually comes back but it never lasts

327.56 --> 333.31
it's always when I switch

330.07 --> 337.78
that's when yeah the magic happens it's

333.31 --> 338.41
weird but basically smoking it

337.78 --> 341.83
continually

338.41 --> 344.35
yeah it's enjoyable to me still I still

341.83 --> 348.07
know how to enjoy it what I wonder

344.35 --> 350.8
sometimes if it's if it's not really

348.07 --> 354.65999999999997
getting in the way it's not keeping me

350.8 --> 359.14
in this in this setting as it were

354.66 --> 364.27000000000004
anyway I do contemplate that a lot right

359.14 --> 365.5
so let's get back to some subjects right

364.27 --> 368.44
yeah yeah I've been watching some

365.5 --> 377.47
Netflix the latest series everybody's

368.44 --> 379.8
probably watched that what's the name

377.47 --> 379.8
again

380.64 --> 389.62
forget what I was watching oh yeah

384.73 --> 393.58000000000004
stranger things to the third season with

389.62 --> 398.65
it was so silly and peril it was kind of

393.58 --> 400.99
like a parody it really was like a

398.65 --> 404.26
parody on reality it was like a kid's

400.99 --> 408.64
parody I was actually quite amazed by

404.26 --> 411.49
just what they put in there with the

408.64 --> 413.22999999999996
evil Russians what it was in the 80s I

411.49 --> 414.85
guess it's supposed to be in the 80s so

413.23 --> 419.41
that still kind of makes sense but it's

414.85 --> 420.88
still so cartoonish now and but they

419.41 --> 422.65000000000003
still I thought they still managed to do

420.88 --> 424.71999999999997
something really good with it now that's

422.65 --> 428.53
not really spoilers it's literally the

424.72 --> 430.84000000000003
first thing you see the first scene okay

428.53 --> 433.35999999999996
I'm not spoiling anything I'm just

430.84 --> 437.73999999999995
saying these are the things involved and

433.36 --> 440.2
it's so the whole thing like the

437.74 --> 445.0
previous series - it is kind of like a

440.2 --> 448.81
kid's imagination adventure becoming

445.0 --> 453.19
real based on what's going on what's put

448.81 --> 456.55
out in the world right now it's like a

453.19 --> 459.04
modern-day children's reflection and and

456.55 --> 462.82
that's what I thought I was and and with

459.04 --> 465.07
that that new poem in it the new subject

462.82 --> 467.92
that's the first scene you get to see

465.07 --> 471.71999999999997
when you open the the Serie so it's not

467.92 --> 474.61
really a spoiler it's the Russians and

471.72 --> 477.51000000000005
it's just I thought he was kind of cool

474.61 --> 480.91
the way they did it but it's also just

477.51 --> 483.61
hilariously ironic anyway enough about

480.91 --> 485.17
that I thought it was okay like I've

483.61 --> 487.51
seen some reviews I watched them

485.17 --> 490.93
afterwards from people that I typically

487.51 --> 493.44
watch that do movie reviews and they

490.93 --> 495.85
said it's not as good as the first two

493.44 --> 499.56
wasn't as excited but still good enough

495.85 --> 503.92
and I kind of agree with that

499.56 --> 506.71
it's a more it's a little bit more

503.92 --> 508.93
casual you could say it's very over

506.71 --> 511.59999999999997
generalized anyway yeah that was that I

508.93 --> 513.669
watched that watched all through it I'm

511.6 --> 516.16
not gonna spoil it and anything not even

513.669 --> 522.28
a hint about it which most reviewers

516.16 --> 524.53
absolutely do even accidentally so I do

522.28 --> 527.23
kind of recommend it if you have Netflix

524.53 --> 532.35
but yeah remember everything about

527.23 --> 532.35
Netflix pretty much has giant amounts of

532.41 --> 538.66
left hist you could call it propaganda

536.4 --> 542.8
placement it's everywhere

538.66 --> 548.5
but I don't know some things are worse

542.8 --> 551.65
than others so yeah anyway a flat earth

548.5 --> 556.81
let's get back to Flat Earth or some

551.65 --> 560.8299999999999
good things yesterday and let me check

556.81 --> 562.3199999999999
back Flat Earth debates I thought it was

560.83 --> 566.4100000000001
pretty good

562.32 --> 570.07
yeah there's there is a new movement on

566.41 --> 576.67
the rise I'm gonna call them the third

570.07 --> 580.09
party and it's kind of scary because I

576.67 --> 583.12
get I get the feeling that the overall

580.09 --> 586.87
situation is causing many flat earthers

583.12 --> 589.38
that are that have been among us for a

586.87 --> 592.36
long time and doing their own thing that

589.38 --> 594.63
certain elements and the overall

592.36 --> 595.72
pressure is caused cost as

594.63 --> 598.89
dissatisfaction

595.72 --> 603.37
and this dissatisfaction has now

598.89 --> 605.47
basically I think made people kind of

603.37 --> 611.34
move in the same direction to kind of

605.47 --> 616.36
Auto conspire to derail everything and

611.34 --> 619.8100000000001
to literally just say nothing matters

616.36 --> 624.28
anymore it's all [ __ ] it's kind of

619.81 --> 627.0
like we've seen signs of this before and

624.28 --> 629.89
we fought it it's kind of like Niall ism

627.0 --> 632.47
because yeah some baller trolls will

629.89 --> 635.41
typically fall into that [ __ ] but

632.47 --> 638.89
everybody always fought against it but

635.41 --> 644.31
then there's just new people popping up

638.89 --> 644.31
trying new things and it's kind of you

644.73 --> 649.72
don't jump right away to the end but

647.71 --> 651.49
it's still going in that direction and

649.72 --> 654.01
they seem to be now making steady

651.49 --> 656.89
progress in how far they are going

654.01 --> 658.96
towards that total nihilistic end point

656.89 --> 661.93
which is the end result of it if you

658.96 --> 665.23
don't have a stable foundation within

661.93 --> 667.9599999999999
reality so I'm really worried I I feel

665.23 --> 671.2
like Dave literally within the journey

667.96 --> 677.2900000000001
of flat earth are getting seduced by the

671.2 --> 680.0200000000001
left-hand path to stray beyond reason

677.29 --> 685.9
because reason has become too burdensome

680.02 --> 688.39
that is my very wet finger work alarmist

685.9 --> 691.6899999999999
analysis about the situation that is

688.39 --> 696.91
unfolding among a lot of people now it's

691.69 --> 697.87
like a handful and they were all siding

696.91 --> 700.06
with one another

697.87 --> 703.03
yesterday in the debates and it's not

700.06 --> 705.3699999999999
just about ooh quantum eraser

703.03 --> 708.31
Oh Nathan following quantum eraser who

705.37 --> 711.01
are we kind of falling in line but still

708.31 --> 712.29
not with everything no it's not about

711.01 --> 716.4399999999999
that

712.29 --> 718.24
it's a sense some things are there

716.44 --> 719.9200000000001
they're just proven and when people

718.24 --> 724.3
start to then make these weird

719.92 --> 727.36
statements like we don't sense this we

724.3 --> 729.3499999999999
don't send that's like a mantra trying

727.36 --> 733.82
to cognitive dissonance something

729.35 --> 735.58
out of reality okay I know what that is

733.82 --> 740.36
I've seen it before

735.58 --> 742.9100000000001
it's kind of a similar tactic mental

740.36 --> 746.08
tactic as to what happens in the more

742.91 --> 748.5799999999999
fanatical social justice warrior circles

746.08 --> 751.34
I've already warned about their

748.58 --> 753.83
entanglement somehow within the Flat

751.34 --> 759.5600000000001
Earth movement years ago that they would

753.83 --> 761.5400000000001
do this so I feel I'm not saying all do

759.56 --> 764.26
your agents they are infiltrating I

761.54 --> 768.1999999999999
think this is kind of like a natural

764.26 --> 771.08
chaotic sidestep course for some people

768.2 --> 774.1400000000001
to take out of a desperation basically

771.08 --> 777.5600000000001
the desperation is the enemy I feel it

774.14 --> 780.8
in my own way I can I experienced it as

777.56 --> 784.0999999999999
being trapped somehow at the same time

780.8 --> 787.13
it still feels like I am going somewhere

784.1 --> 790.61
and people appreciate me and they do

787.13 --> 793.67
support me so I that makes it really

790.61 --> 796.61
cool I don't know that makes it doable

793.67 --> 799.67
and this is also kind of ironic because

796.61 --> 801.77
Persky mo is one of those people among

799.67 --> 805.16
many flat earthers and ballers that say

801.77 --> 807.56
oh my god are when you're such a we can

805.16 --> 810.4699999999999
trust you because you're asking for

807.56 --> 812.9599999999999
money how do we know it's genuine how do

810.47 --> 816.2900000000001
we know it's genuine is if you ask for

812.96 --> 817.58
money that's not super schemers accent

816.29 --> 822.4699999999999
by the way I'm not even gonna try that

817.58 --> 826.45
and whiney voice but yeah I do it for

822.47 --> 830.24
also for money because it helps me

826.45 --> 833.3900000000001
withstand the pressure and build a

830.24 --> 838.1800000000001
financial basis that is required in

833.39 --> 838.18
order to do this and survive it

839.11 --> 844.24
that's it and that's just a code that's

841.63 --> 845.98
become kind of a condition with Flat

844.24 --> 848.59
Earth because there is a lot to deal

845.98 --> 853.54
with but it takes a lot away a lot of

848.59 --> 856.51
opportunity for financial broad world

853.54 --> 860.73
things but yeah that's kind of worth it

856.51 --> 863.86
but still you have to get around so and

860.73 --> 866.26
spruce chemo is one of these people that

863.86 --> 872.83
just says oh no no money no money is

866.26 --> 875.67
ridiculous so how is he managing does he

872.83 --> 878.44
have a really good job what is that job

875.67 --> 882.43
does it allow room for him to do all

878.44 --> 884.98
this does do people know that that he's

882.43 --> 887.29
doing that all these factors all play

884.98 --> 890.98
into the stress level that he's wielding

887.29 --> 893.7099999999999
and I think that he has basically

890.98 --> 896.98
overstepped his own boundaries in what

893.71 --> 901.1500000000001
he can handle and now he's kind of like

896.98 --> 903.3100000000001
that creates a crack in literally a

901.15 --> 906.51
psychotic right I call it a psychotic

903.31 --> 910.3599999999999
break that's literally what that is

906.51 --> 913.63
literally that it's not a joke it's not

910.36 --> 917.11
a troll that I said that and when that

913.63 --> 920.8
crack opens under that pressure then

917.11 --> 925.48
basically lucifer slips in and tells you

920.8 --> 927.31
look all this reason all this dealing

925.48 --> 932.83
with this reason is causing you so much

927.31 --> 935.14
trust you don't need it anymore it's

932.83 --> 939.21
like I remember I remember when I

935.14 --> 942.79
remember I remember when I lost my mind

939.21 --> 946.39
that that song it was such a relief it's

942.79 --> 948.16
such a room suddenly you can hear

946.39 --> 950.08
everything I can hear my mind like an

948.16 --> 952.24
echo all that that's it's the

950.08 --> 955.2700000000001
description of a psychotic break when

952.24 --> 958.51
you throw down reason and when you throw

955.27 --> 960.76
down reason that can be therapeutical in

958.51 --> 962.92
the right setting it's like okay I'm

960.76 --> 965.71
just going nuts from stress I'm going on

962.92 --> 969.64
a short holiday just go somewhere and

965.71 --> 972.74
just be like [ __ ] all attitude you know

969.64 --> 975.29
that's a way to deal with that stress

972.74 --> 978.2
but if you're gonna do it like and still

975.29 --> 981.8299999999999
continue in your job yeah you're gonna

978.2 --> 988.6600000000001
be display weird behaviors and basically

981.83 --> 992.36
try to express like a newfound solution

988.66 --> 993.65
abandoning reason muffling it up it

992.36 --> 996.86
doesn't matter anymore

993.65 --> 1000.49
the reason or because it's all fake

996.86 --> 1003.61
that's that's the road to solipsism and

1000.49 --> 1009.45
that's what's happening and it worries

1003.61 --> 1012.82
me very much like really it does

1009.45 --> 1019.24
Thanks Thank You Ronnie fashi my vocals

1012.82 --> 1021.9100000000001
are look they're okay I'm just because

1019.24 --> 1024.22
of the smoking they suck you know I used

1021.91 --> 1028.57
to really want to become kind of like a

1024.22 --> 1032.26
singer but yeah the issues that come

1028.57 --> 1034.33
with the industry of course and I I

1032.26 --> 1036.01
started smoking and couldn't give it up

1034.33 --> 1040.1499999999999
and that kind of ruined my voice and

1036.01 --> 1043.66
even if I didn't my dad and my mom don't

1040.15 --> 1048.1000000000001
have the best of vocal cords they have

1043.66 --> 1050.53
my mother has that brain that brain for

1048.1 --> 1053.07
the sense of sound oh yeah and I

1050.53 --> 1057.04
inherited that but my vocal cords

1053.07 --> 1062.6499999999999
unfortunately have never been ideal for

1057.04 --> 1066.9099999999999
a singer unfortunately but I have just

1062.65 --> 1070.0600000000002
out of hobby train to get grab the right

1066.91 --> 1073.0900000000001
tone I I kind of behave like a parrot

1070.06 --> 1074.9199999999998
with music I and I like really trying to

1073.09 --> 1076.8999999999999
follow tones and really complicated

1074.92 --> 1079.63
music and then emulate it like a parrot

1076.9 --> 1081.25
and really resonate with it I can do

1079.63 --> 1083.2
that so I can find the right tone

1081.25 --> 1086.2
absolutely and understand tones

1083.2 --> 1090.79
understand what that is can grab tones

1086.2 --> 1094.96
from really complicated angles but as

1090.79 --> 1097.35
for the overall quality of my my vocal

1094.96 --> 1097.3500000000001
cords

1099.86 --> 1107.1499999999999
it's not a lot there unfortunately

1102.59 --> 1107.1499999999999
that's also a reason why I kind of like

1107.69 --> 1115.2
like wanted to basically have a kid with

1111.69 --> 1115.65
my ex because she had amazing vocal

1115.2 --> 1118.79
cords

1115.65 --> 1123.9
so beautiful she could be like classical

1118.79 --> 1128.19
and that's an ability I want to get in

1123.9 --> 1131.3400000000001
the gene pool so yeah any woman that can

1128.19 --> 1133.5900000000001
really sing and not just some popular

1131.34 --> 1142.35
[ __ ] but like really sing oh my god

1133.59 --> 1149.4599999999998
that's a way definitely to me as as Owen

1142.35 --> 1153.7199999999998
Benjamin described it yeah and it's also

1149.46 --> 1155.8500000000001
why I absolutely hate equalizers in the

1153.72 --> 1158.04
music industry I can't stand it and I

1155.85 --> 1160.82
can hear it every time you can't conceal

1158.04 --> 1167.059
that [ __ ] from me I can't stand it

1160.82 --> 1167.059
it's mutilated sound terrible

1172.309 --> 1180.74
I had Tamara coffee by the way still

1175.37 --> 1186.7399999999998
have tea anyway yeah that was my piece

1180.74 --> 1189.049
on what is worrying me arising in the

1186.74 --> 1191.059
Flat Earth movement it's it's funny

1189.049 --> 1195.32
because it kind of synchronizes in its

1191.059 --> 1197.45
own way weird way this is a very remote

1195.32 --> 1201.1689999999999
comparison so don't take it too serious

1197.45 --> 1204.769
with my D&D world in how I originally

1201.169 --> 1208.22
conceptualized it sort of unrest

1204.769 --> 1210.74
political opposition to manifest within

1208.22 --> 1212.33
the Dwarven realm that's really their

1210.74 --> 1217.3700000000001
own closed realm they're very to

1212.33 --> 1221.1789999999999
themselves very creative stacking up a

1217.37 --> 1226.4599999999998
lot of resources and basically like a

1221.179 --> 1230.51
political cult of evil and like lawful

1226.46 --> 1235.25
selfishness sprung up in that out of an

1230.51 --> 1237.74
unrest like like a corruption from too

1235.25 --> 1240.62
much luxury and too much political

1237.74 --> 1243.2
corruption issue that type of situation

1240.62 --> 1245.4799999999998
it arose it just people became Restless

1243.2 --> 1247.549
and just said like [ __ ] it I'm gonna I'm

1245.48 --> 1250.519
gonna follow another god because this is

1247.549 --> 1253.94
all getting [ __ ] and then they turn

1250.519 --> 1256.1
to evil as it were and I feel almost

1253.94 --> 1258.769
like this could be something similar

1256.1 --> 1263.0
like they're literally just saying now

1258.769 --> 1266.8990000000001
screw it I don't like this anymore I

1263.0 --> 1269.87
want to die further even if I have to

1266.899 --> 1272.6299999999999
abandon reason and like other people

1269.87 --> 1274.9399999999998
like Merle for example I actually was on

1272.63 --> 1277.97
his show once I didn't know who he was

1274.94 --> 1280.3400000000001
and then I figured it out during the

1277.97 --> 1283.429
show that guy has some serious psychotic

1280.34 --> 1285.47
tendencies but it's continually any yes

1283.429 --> 1288.44
Don doesn't has the it doesn't have the

1285.47 --> 1290.48
ability to snap out of it and he can

1288.44 --> 1294.8890000000001
make good points sometimes that's funny

1290.48 --> 1299.51
thing he can grab these frequencies and

1294.889 --> 1302.029
put something down pretty decently but

1299.51 --> 1304.08
when it comes to overall oversight not

1302.029 --> 1306.299
just in the moment but over

1304.08 --> 1309.75
oversight and purpose and long-term goal

1306.299 --> 1313.019
he has nothing this guy is a total wake

1309.75 --> 1314.73
up in the morning whatever his mind at

1313.019 --> 1319.44
the time tells him is what he thinks

1314.73 --> 1324.48
it's just it's sad that's not sensible

1319.44 --> 1330.269
and some of these other guy who else was

1324.48 --> 1330.96
on spur scheme outside this it wasn't

1330.269 --> 1335.22
alone

1330.96 --> 1339.419
oh yeah David oh my god that well David

1335.22 --> 1341.8500000000001
is of course David and yeah I said it in

1339.419 --> 1347.13
chat many times yesterday classic David

1341.85 --> 1349.1689999999999
it's difficult for him to just I don't

1347.13 --> 1351.179
think he realized what he's doing but

1349.169 --> 1355.679
he's basically chasing his dream and he

1351.179 --> 1358.3200000000002
just he's not that good at really at the

1355.679 --> 1360.1490000000001
oversight thing never has been it's not

1358.32 --> 1362.1899999999998
because of the pressure of the oversight

1360.149 --> 1366.33
it's just that he's just fooling around

1362.19 --> 1369.72
because that's what he does and he's not

1366.33 --> 1372.149
mean but it just doesn't have the site

1369.72 --> 1374.25
for it it just can't see what's really

1372.149 --> 1376.1689999999999
happening and that's why I think he's

1374.25 --> 1378.87
gone on to this because to him it's like

1376.169 --> 1382.409
a new adventure doesn't realize that

1378.87 --> 1383.899
it's literally abandoning sensibility

1382.409 --> 1391.519
itself

1383.899 --> 1398.6689999999999
yeah yeah Merle I am I am pretty normal

1391.519 --> 1402.179
that's right but that's a that's only

1398.669 --> 1406.0800000000002
because I've managed to resolve and

1402.179 --> 1408.929
contain a lot of the freaky issues that

1406.08 --> 1411.149
are that were born into me that

1408.929 --> 1413.8500000000001
manifested in reflection to the things

1411.149 --> 1415.529
that happen in my life but I think I

1413.85 --> 1418.26
kind of managed it there so there are

1415.529 --> 1422.789
still some practical issues but as for

1418.26 --> 1427.2
my psychology my behavior my principles

1422.789 --> 1430.44
I think I did pretty damn well and I am

1427.2 --> 1433.799
definitely not psychotic absolutely not

1430.44 --> 1437.1000000000001
I have seen weird things I experienced

1433.799 --> 1439.85
weird things I even well basically

1437.1 --> 1443.309
from an outsider perspective claimed

1439.85 --> 1446.6399999999999
extrasensory perception in the sense

1443.309 --> 1448.74
that I have an extra sense with which I

1446.64 --> 1450.6000000000001
tune to frequencies and all that and to

1448.74 --> 1452.309
some people out there and maybe a lot of

1450.6 --> 1454.1399999999999
people I don't know how many who

1452.309 --> 1457.2
understand this this is a complete

1454.14 --> 1458.64
mystery or they will think who oh he is

1457.2 --> 1461.64
just like my mother

1458.64 --> 1463.47
or something my mother always had that

1461.64 --> 1464.3700000000001
ability never understood that's just

1463.47 --> 1466.95
yeah that's my mother

1464.37 --> 1470.1589999999999
maybe people will associate that with

1466.95 --> 1476.49
what I talk about concerning that extra

1470.159 --> 1482.2990000000002
sense the frequency sense but yeah I am

1476.49 --> 1482.299
relatively normal in the sense that I

1483.14 --> 1490.76
haven't taken the left-hand path or in a

1486.57 --> 1495.059
sense that I did in the past do that and

1490.76 --> 1497.07
got damaged and then quickly recovered

1495.059 --> 1499.049
from it and then dealt with all that

1497.07 --> 1502.049
damage that even proceeded after that

1499.049 --> 1504.99
because it did mess of my life and I was

1502.049 --> 1509.539
in my own way psychotic and it

1504.99 --> 1513.15
manifested in megalomaniacal t basically

1509.539 --> 1514.919
but I learned from that I got out of it

1513.15 --> 1517.47
I recognized it I understand the

1514.919 --> 1520.289
frequency I understand the illusion

1517.47 --> 1522.299
itself if that illusion would overcome

1520.289 --> 1524.52
me and that can happen by a combination

1522.299 --> 1527.1
of feelings and stress or whatever I

1524.52 --> 1531.78
will recognize it and I will not listen

1527.1 --> 1533.8999999999999
to what it tells me it's literally like

1531.78 --> 1536.28
a demon it's just whispering in your ear

1533.9 --> 1539.52
when that kind of [ __ ] happens

1536.28 --> 1542.9089999999999
that's what extreme feeling convinced

1539.52 --> 1550.8899999999999
ability does to a person when they are

1542.909 --> 1553.2890000000002
not strong enough to with withstand the

1550.89 --> 1557.3400000000001
impulses their own feelings are giving

1553.289 --> 1559.71
them when they're not convinced by

1557.34 --> 1561.8899999999999
reason but by their feelings by the

1559.71 --> 1566.299
presence of their feelings themselves

1561.89 --> 1566.2990000000002
and I I don't do that anymore

1567.15 --> 1576.67
that's right PJ okay left hand path

1572.35 --> 1579.9099999999999
right hand path it is it is very broad

1576.67 --> 1583.0900000000001
term very complex very overly

1579.91 --> 1585.13
conspirators even in the in the

1583.09 --> 1588.31
mainstream by now but what it means it

1585.13 --> 1591.64
refers again to logos left-hand path is

1588.31 --> 1599.01
when you say no I don't accept I don't

1591.64 --> 1601.99
accept the standard of what is like in

1599.01 --> 1606.82
everything or in some things that the

1601.99 --> 1611.28
world has reflected on upon me and it's

1606.82 --> 1613.78
basically a rejection of reason and

1611.28 --> 1616.24
normal sensibility yeah that's what it

1613.78 --> 1622.72
is the sensibility it is what the normal

1616.24 --> 1625.41
senses tell us from yeah Sensibility and

1622.72 --> 1629.89
if you are desensitized then you have

1625.41 --> 1633.22
trouble with sensibility and if you have

1629.89 --> 1636.19
been ruined or destroyed then your

1633.22 --> 1638.8
sensibility may be considered like your

1636.19 --> 1641.31
enemy that that's often what evil does

1638.8 --> 1644.9199999999998
they consider their own sensibilities as

1641.31 --> 1651.27
bad so they tried to get rid of it they

1644.92 --> 1656.44
desensitize themselves but anyway

1651.27 --> 1661.77
left-hand path is basically abandoning

1656.44 --> 1661.77
sensibility in order for some unique

1661.89 --> 1667.92
unique thing you're trying to achieve or

1665.11 --> 1672.4499999999998
some dream you're trying to achieve and

1667.92 --> 1676.39
in yeah in your way and that may include

1672.45 --> 1679.21
delusions or just certain rigid opinions

1676.39 --> 1682.8700000000001
or it could be anything it's basically

1679.21 --> 1687.96
the way you do it is abandoning right

1682.87 --> 1687.9599999999998
yeah it's going for a lie or a dream and

1689.81 --> 1695.48
it's really complicated because if you

1692.33 --> 1697.6999999999998
really believe it's real then yeah you

1695.48 --> 1699.44
will still get the punishment for your

1697.7 --> 1701.93
foolishness but it's not the same thing

1699.44 --> 1704.0
as when you realize that it's actually a

1701.93 --> 1706.46
lie and you're using it as a cover and

1704.0 --> 1709.04
that is a true left hand but that's just

1706.46 --> 1711.14
a path of evil but the left-hand path

1709.04 --> 1713.81
can also be kind of like taken by

1711.14 --> 1718.22
accident and that's what happened to me

1713.81 --> 1721.12
I just because of my because I was

1718.22 --> 1721.1200000000001
desensitized

1724.66 --> 1730.3600000000001
but yeah the left-hand path the

1727.0 --> 1732.76
right-hand path is basically just what

1730.36 --> 1734.86
the right-hand path entails is just

1732.76 --> 1742.21
trying to be sensible doing the right

1734.86 --> 1750.01
thing being constructive be recognizing

1742.21 --> 1753.3700000000001
being sensible learning gaining wisdom

1750.01 --> 1755.3799999999999
and also yeah the procreation cycle is

1753.37 --> 1758.35
kind of important too it's part of logos

1755.38 --> 1761.3200000000002
it's stop

1758.35 --> 1764.5
yeah stop trying to collect lollipops

1761.32 --> 1768.1599999999999
and fancy pants and no dumpster pumping

1764.5 --> 1771.94
and all that and just try to actually go

1768.16 --> 1774.91
for a partner and mate instead of just

1771.94 --> 1778.03
some some person that just wants to

1774.91 --> 1782.68
literally screw around with everyone you

1778.03 --> 1785.44
know that kind of [ __ ] and yeah the

1782.68 --> 1788.98
problem is is that when you're young and

1785.44 --> 1791.68
when you don't know any of that then it

1788.98 --> 1795.46
just is very appealing like that total

1791.68 --> 1798.55
freedom opposing to yeah you're in

1795.46 --> 1800.44
abilities as a kid and you're a lack of

1798.55 --> 1803.23
oversight you just want that freedom

1800.44 --> 1809.3500000000001
that's freedom to screw around and that

1803.23 --> 1812.02
seems ideal but in reality it's not that

1809.35 --> 1815.23
ideal and then if people don't let that

1812.02 --> 1818.62
go and just say no I don't want to do it

1815.23 --> 1820.8700000000001
I want to keep on trying this then they

1818.62 --> 1825.28
are in their own way also taking a

1820.87 --> 1829.33
left-hand turn and it doesn't have to be

1825.28 --> 1832.87
evil it's just not wise and these people

1829.33 --> 1834.55
will then probably eventually end up

1832.87 --> 1837.6399999999999
getting into some really weird [ __ ]

1834.55 --> 1840.25
freaky [ __ ] unhealthy [ __ ] they could

1837.64 --> 1843.69
get like serious diseases or ailments

1840.25 --> 1849.37
from it or psychological trauma

1843.69 --> 1851.53
potentially yeah or in worst case

1849.37 --> 1853.059
scenario become complete Psychopaths

1851.53 --> 1855.95
but that's

1853.059 --> 1858.769
yeah that usually doesn't really just

1855.95 --> 1862.009
happen out by itself usually that

1858.769 --> 1864.23
entails getting contact with really bad

1862.009 --> 1866.169
outsiders and then being stupid enough

1864.23 --> 1870.529
to go with that

1866.169 --> 1873.8600000000001
but yeah that's also a left-hand risk it

1870.529 --> 1877.309
all falls into just what is healthy what

1873.86 --> 1880.07
does it lead to it's really all about

1877.309 --> 1883.61
reality and just the practical reality

1880.07 --> 1888.86
are nature's what humans need what will

1883.61 --> 1891.649
happen how people can be fooled and what

1888.86 --> 1895.879
the results of that are it's it's

1891.649 --> 1899.6
basically it put an overall spiritual

1895.879 --> 1902.029
guide a frequency guide right hand path

1899.6 --> 1903.769
is just being as sensible as possible as

1902.029 --> 1907.34
reasonable as possible and not getting

1903.769 --> 1910.879
distracted by your own appetites by your

1907.34 --> 1915.4599999999998
own ooh I want this so badly oh I want

1910.879 --> 1918.4699999999998
this lollipop so badly that's yeah

1915.46 --> 1921.3990000000001
deflecting the seductions that's also

1918.47 --> 1921.3990000000001
right hand path

1923.37 --> 1925.9699999999998
so

1926.41 --> 1929.6090000000002
[Music]

1931.71 --> 1934.309
Wow

1934.89 --> 1942.3300000000002
lots of activity don't know if you guys

1940.049 --> 1945.71
really cared about that but yeah right

1942.33 --> 1945.71
hand path left hand path

1954.54 --> 1963.4099999999999
Irina's seductive really you got gay

1958.8 --> 1963.4099999999999
feelings for me Multi TomTom disorder

1973.83 --> 1981.1499999999999
people want to worship Owen Benjamin -

1977.309 --> 1981.1499999999999
yeah maybe

1992.15 --> 1999.289
III don't really want to be worshipped

1994.82 --> 2001.48
okay just for the record because that is

1999.289 --> 2003.8799999999999
completely useless when you get

2001.48 --> 2006.429
worshipped that means people then fall

2003.88 --> 2009.21
in love with a dream with you and stop

2006.429 --> 2012.8500000000001
actually listening

2009.21 --> 2015.279
so getting worshipped is pretty useless

2012.85 --> 2018.58
it's useful if you want a lot of puppets

2015.279 --> 2021.929
and then try to impose some kind of a

2018.58 --> 2024.73
bunch of acts upon them but if you

2021.929 --> 2027.46
really have a specific message you want

2024.73 --> 2030.25
to convey and you want to basically for

2027.46 --> 2035.169
them to become sensible and try to take

2030.25 --> 2039.46
over certain good habits then worship is

2035.169 --> 2044.5590000000002
terrible because people that worship you

2039.46 --> 2046.98
don't listen or they listen to the wrong

2044.559 --> 2046.98
things

2050.02 --> 2062.02
maril um no thank you no no no no no

2059.95 --> 2067.0299999999997
Merle you do your own hangout

2062.02 --> 2070.54
sorry but I'm not I'm not gonna go into

2067.03 --> 2073.9190000000003
discussion with you okay everything I

2070.54 --> 2078.7
said it's just it's kind of brutal it

2073.919 --> 2083.83
but yeah just everything that's come out

2078.7 --> 2088.0
of you so far it's just not it's not

2083.83 --> 2092.95
feasible you know when it comes to

2088.0 --> 2095.859
normal which how could you call it

2092.95 --> 2099.04
social interaction senses that is where

2095.859 --> 2101.83
I do attribute that you do have some

2099.04 --> 2105.49
sensibility Merle but when it comes to

2101.83 --> 2111.04
actual mechanical things that kind of

2105.49 --> 2113.0
[ __ ] no no your your feeble at best

2111.04 --> 2117.41
sorry

2113.0 --> 2119.69
ooh wow thanks for that James Mays do I

2117.41 --> 2123.33
need other super Chet morning share the

2119.69 --> 2126.55

2123.33 --> 2126.5499999999997
[Music]

2133.8 --> 2137.9900000000002
that's right fresh 75

2140.24 --> 2150.1299999999997
no no Merle I was actually hoping to get

2152.619 --> 2159.88
mind-warped on is here seems to be

2156.95 --> 2159.8799999999997
active let me see

2171.85 --> 2179.83
No Merle is just gonna be more trying to

2177.01 --> 2181.57
be a really good e to shoe guys because

2179.83 --> 2183.73
he's kind of good at it it's what he did

2181.57 --> 2186.2200000000003
yesterday but he only does it to

2183.73 --> 2189.94
basically pat try to pacify everyone

2186.22 --> 2192.73
and my point stand and I don't want to

2189.94 --> 2195.7000000000003
slap him or around the face with it in

2192.73 --> 2199.26
person okay because I don't think

2195.7 --> 2199.2599999999998
there's anything he can do about it

2199.42 --> 2202.579
[Music]

2210.66 --> 2222.71
but how can I prove that you can't do

2219.569 --> 2225.9
anything about it it's just your I do

2222.71 --> 2228.96
take notice of humor I do notice when

2225.9 --> 2232.5
you are somewhere and you just have this

2228.96 --> 2234.799
very it's like oh yeah Merle is there

2232.5 --> 2239.849
because first you hear the voice and

2234.799 --> 2242.13
then at some point it's like you snap

2239.849 --> 2244.319
from all the energy of the attention and

2242.13 --> 2248.5190000000002
you just start to throw out these weird

2244.319 --> 2250.68
Warped claims and or extreme red

2248.519 --> 2254.4599999999996
herrings and you do it you do it every

2250.68 --> 2258.24
time it's just that's you Merle and I'm

2254.46 --> 2274.14
not holding it against you but it's just

2258.24 --> 2275.6699999999996
not feasible sorry everybody insists

2274.14 --> 2280.41
that I have a mom okay

2275.67 --> 2283.279
fine but I don't really feel like it if

2280.41 --> 2283.279
you know what I mean

2290.07 --> 2298.02
yeah yeah I am kind of nervous Merle

2292.68 --> 2303.4199999999996
because I am basically just again being

2298.02 --> 2304.35
very honest and it's not really nice to

2303.42 --> 2310.01
lay down

2304.35 --> 2313.11
yeah such analysis about people okay

2310.01 --> 2316.0200000000004
like I don't feel any objections say

2313.11 --> 2318.27
saying things that I did about sports

2316.02 --> 2321.84
chemo because that guy is just set in

2318.27 --> 2327.6
his ways what you however Merle are

2321.84 --> 2330.4500000000003
still your spirit is still kind of good

2327.6 --> 2333.33
you just don't have any control and that

2330.45 --> 2336.1499999999996
makes it what you do unfeasible that's

2333.33 --> 2339.27
my issue and I don't think you're an

2336.15 --> 2341.48
evil person okay I think you're just not

2339.27 --> 2344.48
completely in control of your own

2341.48 --> 2344.48
faculties

2345.93 --> 2351.72
[Music]

2348.93 --> 2354.2799999999997
yeah well morale look if you're gonna

2351.72 --> 2358.41
say things like that that's not actually

2354.28 --> 2358.4100000000003
gonna help convince me to get you on

2378.94 --> 2387.069

2401.44 --> 2405.93

2414.249 --> 2425.269
ya know it's not gonna happen

2418.18 --> 2431.1189999999997

2431.119 --> 2436.819
anyone that I actually care about really

2433.759 --> 2442.009
a lot that I really know except for a

2436.819 --> 2448.579
phase maybe not seeing anything oh god

2442.009 --> 2452.869
yeah Oh Brenda that [ __ ] sake why is

2448.579 --> 2455.9300000000003
it always the worst you know Brenda

2452.869 --> 2459.259
frickin sends me a message on skype

2455.93 --> 2461.359
every single day that she wants to get

2459.259 --> 2465.069
on my show but it's always in the last

2461.359 --> 2469.519
50 minutes every single freaking day

2465.069 --> 2477.579
you know I'll just show it on skype to

2469.519 --> 2477.5789999999997
you that's not just a claim look at this

2478.63 --> 2485.859
today yesterday Wednesday three like

2481.989 --> 2488.4700000000003
that okay not every day right but kid

2485.859 --> 2491.3489999999997
and before that's just constantly huh

2488.47 --> 2495.4599999999996
get on can I please get in today please

2491.349 --> 2497.9500000000003
get in and keep on saying like no I've

2495.46 --> 2501.549
had you on plenty it's always the same

2497.95 --> 2503.41
[ __ ] I already have to endure you on

2501.549 --> 2508.239
almost daily basis on the Flat Earth

2503.41 --> 2516.009
debates okay it's not like you're gonna

2508.239 --> 2521.829
bring in anything new no I much prefer

2516.009 --> 2526.2
some yeah I would actually prefer to

2521.829 --> 2526.2000000000003
have Merlin over of Brenda

2539.87 --> 2549.2599999999998
oh yeah sure you could I doubt there's

2546.38 --> 2552.1400000000003
anything you could say Brenda that I

2549.26 --> 2554.03
could not understand I think I

2552.14 --> 2558.5899999999997
understand a lot of the things you say a

2554.03 --> 2561.0800000000004
lot better then you do because you're a

2558.59 --> 2563.27
drone and you drone [ __ ] on and you

2561.08 --> 2564.71
don't actually know half the time what

2563.27 --> 2566.69
should hell you're talking about because

2564.71 --> 2568.13
you're just pulling it out of the air

2566.69 --> 2578.21
because you heard somebody say it

2568.13 --> 2580.79
sometime oh oh oh talking about the

2578.21 --> 2582.56
flight okay I did check that out at that

2580.79 --> 2588.95
that freaking thing that was supposed to

2582.56 --> 2593.54
happen yeah well I stream my ass that

2588.95 --> 2597.6099999999997
was total [ __ ] pretty much nothing

2593.54 --> 2601.58
happened it just kept on giving snippets

2597.61 --> 2603.44
cockpit stuff and then caught out again

2601.58 --> 2607.61
and then it was all distorted and all

2603.44 --> 2612.35
the technical difficulties mm-hmm I was

2607.61 --> 2614.15
such yeah it was it was one of the

2612.35 --> 2617.7999999999997
things that I predicted it just pretty

2614.15 --> 2620.84
much didn't didn't happen the video part

2617.8 --> 2622.73
and then they're probably gonna oh look

2620.84 --> 2625.55
oh yeah the livestream didn't really

2622.73 --> 2630.26
work oh we gave you this look but we did

2625.55 --> 2635.4700000000003
record it afterwards here is it you know

2630.26 --> 2635.4700000000003
it's so typical they always do that

2674.25 --> 2680.26
all right yeah you know what Brenda

2677.64 --> 2682.0899999999997
nothing has pretty much happened as far

2680.26 --> 2686.76
as I'm concerned because there was no

2682.09 --> 2690.88
actual livestream and will analyze the

2686.76 --> 2694.84
after Word video they put out one it's

2690.88 --> 2697.7400000000002
put out you know what I'll actually

2694.84 --> 2704.23
review whatever they're gonna put out on

2697.74 --> 2706.859
my show with video and I'll bring back

2704.23 --> 2709.75
the original prediction analysis and

2706.859 --> 2712.45
then we'll see how much of that

2709.75 --> 2718.26
prediction analysis turns out to be

2712.45 --> 2731.109
right this isn't it crash into it

2718.26 --> 2733.0600000000004
that's hilarious good temporal but could

2731.109 --> 2734.98
that goodtimz for all that wouldn't

2733.06 --> 2737.5299999999997
really make sense because then it would

2734.98 --> 2740.53
have what did it crash in the north so

2737.53 --> 2748.869
is there a a dome edge in the north that

2740.53 --> 2751.03
wouldn't make any sense no look if it's

2748.869 --> 2756.339
supposedly out there then it should

2751.03 --> 2759.4
still be flying right now I think right

2756.339 --> 2762.31
it takes more than 24 hours that flight

2759.4 --> 2766.839
right maybe I'm wrong maybe I don't know

2762.31 --> 2769.68
how long was it estimated to take didn't

2766.839 --> 2769.68
hear anything about that

2772.69 --> 2779.559
it is my right right so it's still

2775.339 --> 2779.5589999999997
supposedly going right no no don't crash

2780.46 --> 2787.7
but there's certainly no 24/7 life there

2784.91 --> 2792.47
certainly no non-stop livestream output

2787.7 --> 2795.23
either so technical difficulties also

2792.47 --> 2798.95
difficult so difficult to get things

2795.23 --> 2800.9
right when you start to do these kind of

2798.95 --> 2804.14
things it's not like you can basically

2800.9 --> 2807.26
double check everything before you try

2804.14 --> 2809.96
it out you know oh no no you have to do

2807.26 --> 2811.849
that while you're supposed to be

2809.96 --> 2814.64
livestream that makes perfect sense for

2811.849 --> 2820.28
a very expensive operation makes perfect

2814.64 --> 2823.3089999999997
perfect sense you know not to get the

2820.28 --> 2825.829
most critical components in order before

2823.309 --> 2828.7400000000002
you go and set out to do what you're

2825.829 --> 2830.63
supposed to do it's nothing like a

2828.74 --> 2835.1899999999996
markup operation on purpose

2830.63 --> 2838.4900000000002
no it doesn't match like perfectly like

2835.19 --> 2842.2000000000003
that but we'll see when they put out the

2838.49 --> 2848.8999999999996
nuts life afterwards video of it all

2842.2 --> 2850.8799999999997
mm-hmm yeah sorry but I was being really

2848.9 --> 2856.4300000000003
really sarcastic it's a bad habit

2850.88 --> 2861.77
according to own Benjamin but I think

2856.43 --> 2862.819
I'm pretty good at it I just you can't

2861.77 --> 2865.67
keep stuck in it

2862.819 --> 2867.529
you know there's remember the South Park

2865.67 --> 2870.589
episode warning about it what happens

2867.529 --> 2872.299
when you keep stuck in sarcasm circus

2870.589 --> 2874.849
the balls I think the episode was called

2872.299 --> 2877.7889999999998
and you get really sick and the end and

2874.849 --> 2881.299
the silly funny thing about that is kind

2877.789 --> 2884.2700000000004
of true I got stuck in sarcastic loops

2881.299 --> 2886.0099999999998
in the past and then I got really

2884.27 --> 2892.569
depressed from that because I couldn't

2886.01 --> 2892.5690000000004
snap out of it it's so silly but yeah

2893.35 --> 2904.21
sarcasm use it with with moderation it's

2902.27 --> 2907.7599999999998
like meat you don't want to have an ol

2904.21 --> 2912.44
sarcastic diet you know that's not

2907.76 --> 2915.8300000000004
healthy better to just leave it out

2912.44 --> 2917.48
entirely if you insist on using it

2915.83 --> 2918.56
because you like it so much or you're so

2917.48 --> 2921.08
such a great cook

2918.56 --> 2924.0499999999997
concerning sarcasm then just take it and

2921.08 --> 2926.13
sparingly use it sparingly that's kind

2924.05 --> 2929.329
of my strategy at the moment

2926.13 --> 2929.329
[Music]

2938.29 --> 2949.69
that South Pole flight right phase of

2945.43 --> 2953.609
course you go for the Argentinian diet

2949.69 --> 2957.82
phase go ahead

2953.609 --> 2961.42
hmm alright so Brenda says it is live

2957.82 --> 2965.53
streaming right now flying over over the

2961.42 --> 2969.25
South Pole fascinating especially since

2965.53 --> 2970.8100000000004
yeah there there was no really since the

2969.25 --> 2974.71
first part of the live stream was pretty

2970.81 --> 2977.23
much broken but yeah if you could post a

2974.71 --> 2984.609
link people that don't have ranches can

2977.23 --> 2986.98
post links here so now chocolate saying

2984.609 --> 2991.6
you got it wrong wood is the material

2986.98 --> 2993.28
cause of table according to Brenda but

2991.6 --> 2996.33
that's just philosophy that's not about

2993.28 --> 2996.3300000000004
scientific method

3008.03 --> 3018.98
okay face oh yeah look it doesn't or

3014.63 --> 3023.359
well it matters a lot how you be you're

3018.98 --> 3026.78
gonna be a vegan but yeah being pure

3023.359 --> 3030.0499999999997
vegan I I wouldn't recommend it unless

3026.78 --> 3033.44
you are pretty wealthy and you can get

3030.05 --> 3036.17
all the right nutritions to fill up what

3033.44 --> 3039.26
will be left as a void when you stop

3036.17 --> 3042.98
eating yeah all the the non vegan

3039.26 --> 3045.5600000000004
products but it is doable but if you're

3042.98 --> 3049.79
not wealthy enough then it's really

3045.56 --> 3052.13
tough it's not good on you unless then

3049.79 --> 3054.05
again you could be much better a vegan

3052.13 --> 3059.57
if for example you have your own

3054.05 --> 3061.55
personal organic garden then it is much

3059.57 --> 3064.4
more feasible actually can you keep them

3061.55 --> 3066.71
checked and you can add extra things to

3064.4 --> 3068.7200000000003
the soil to make sure you get everything

3066.71 --> 3070.849
you need in the amounts you need but

3068.72 --> 3073.7599999999998
it's tough being a vegan a vegetarian is

3070.849 --> 3077.81
actually not that hard in my opinion and

3073.76 --> 3082.849
I still take fish oil I just don't take

3077.81 --> 3090.19
meat the actual flesh thing I don't eat

3082.849 --> 3090.19
flesh but I will eat fats from fish

3092.71 --> 3101.29
and I might eat chicken bone broth also

3097.63 --> 3104.8
not meat except maybe for Christmas once

3101.29 --> 3106.359
a year but I'm even considering it

3104.8 --> 3109.329
dropping that because the last time I

3106.359 --> 3114.15
tried I could get one bite and then my

3109.329 --> 3117.849
body was just like no don't do that

3114.15 --> 3122.4100000000003
so my body is basically done with flesh

3117.849 --> 3125.38
I think just says like yeah it was nice

3122.41 --> 3126.839
while it lasted but you don't we don't

3125.38 --> 3131.79
want that anymore

3126.839 --> 3135.359
so but yeah fish oil I will absolutely

3131.79 --> 3142.7799999999997
keep on taking fish oil if I can and

3135.359 --> 3148.7799999999997
similar products and bone broth if I get

3142.78 --> 3151.75
the chance but that's about it because I

3148.78 --> 3154.869
yeah and get cheese because you can take

3151.75 --> 3158.17
cheese away from attachment but other

3154.869 --> 3161.049
than that no I think I'm pretty much now

3158.17 --> 3163.63
also decided to quit using coffee milk

3161.049 --> 3165.369
entirely I didn't use coffee milk in my

3163.63 --> 3167.4
tumeric coffee because it's just not

3165.369 --> 3169.9900000000002
necessary but even in the morning coffee

3167.4 --> 3173.349
today I just didn't use it and I was

3169.99 --> 3176.7599999999998
like you know what I don't know why I

3173.349 --> 3179.799
was using that in the first place so

3176.76 --> 3183.9100000000003
yeah cutting down on me I never drink

3179.799 --> 3186.19
normal or even organic milk fresh milk I

3183.91 --> 3188.2
don't do that anymore haven't for a long

3186.19 --> 3190.29
time so it's just pretty much cheese for

3188.2 --> 3193.6899999999996
the taste on the side with things and

3190.29 --> 3195.819
eggs I definitely do eat eggs and I use

3193.69 --> 3199.48
butter like the best quality organic

3195.819 --> 3203.23
butter and that's it and the fish oil

3199.48 --> 3205.72
and sometimes if I have a bone broth

3203.23 --> 3209.5
that's pretty much everything animal

3205.72 --> 3214.1499999999996
related that I consume the rest is all

3209.5 --> 3216.91
just yeah vegetables and fruits right

3214.15 --> 3222.6600000000003
yeah raw milk that's that's a really

3216.91 --> 3225.39
cool idea like I tried raw camel milk

3222.66 --> 3228.39
that's even more interesting it has some

3225.39 --> 3231.5899999999997
very serious health benefits from what I

3228.39 --> 3233.64
understood back then rock camel milk

3231.59 --> 3235.98
especially if it's really fresh

3233.64 --> 3238.74
they froze it for some reason that

3235.98 --> 3242.64
worked that didn't damage it as much but

3238.74 --> 3248.9399999999996
I don't really have access to any raw

3242.64 --> 3251.31
milk and it's just I don't feel the urge

3248.94 --> 3253.8
it's not like oh my god I'm missing milk

3251.31 --> 3256.14
so much find me a cow I'm instinctively

3253.8 --> 3258.78
trying to find a cow or goat like I want

3256.14 --> 3262.7999999999997
that fresh-squeezed know if my body just

3258.78 --> 3265.17
says like me just make sure you keep the

3262.8 --> 3267.6200000000003
eggs keep the fish oil and things will

3265.17 --> 3267.62
be alright

3273.81 --> 3281.32
but if I'd ever have children and I want

3280.24 --> 3283.2999999999997
to so yeah

3281.32 --> 3288.5800000000004
when let's just say when I have children

3283.3 --> 3291.13
I will not take milk out of the picture

3288.58 --> 3293.38
entirely so of course breastfeeding

3291.13 --> 3298.3
extremely importance one of the things I

3293.38 --> 3301.62
will pick out my spouse with they have

3298.3 --> 3305.6200000000003
to be able to do that and have a record

3301.62 --> 3312.18
anyway they enough fill in the

3305.62 --> 3314.2599999999998
application after the show right but I

3312.18 --> 3316.99
think it would be an interesting idea

3314.26 --> 3319.9
that if you have like especially really

3316.99 --> 3322.9599999999996
young children to give them raw milk on

3319.9 --> 3325.87
the side when the breastfeeding ends you

3322.96 --> 3329.65
know how will be awesome maybe goat milk

3325.87 --> 3331.63
or cow milk or maybe even camel milk who

3329.65 --> 3336.07
knows whatever could be available at the

3331.63 --> 3339.1600000000003
time so I wouldn't take that out of my

3336.07 --> 3342.1600000000003
children's diet but me as a almost 40

3339.16 --> 3345.91
year old man I don't feel like I just

3342.16 --> 3349.45
really need that maybe I would start to

3345.91 --> 3351.6099999999997
crave for it a little bit more if I like

3349.45 --> 3354.49
get a little wealthier and got it more

3351.61 --> 3356.7400000000002
into physical workouts maybe then I'd

3354.49 --> 3360.22
get more hunger because yeah there is of

3356.74 --> 3363.8199999999997
course the the muscle building elements

3360.22 --> 3369.16
the the way within the milk and all that

3363.82 --> 3372.46
besides all the the specific flora

3369.16 --> 3374.6499999999996
benefits and all that from raw milk it

3372.46 --> 3377.56
is yeah it also has the way in it which

3374.65 --> 3379.33
is normally used even in a muscle

3377.56 --> 3381.1
building so maybe then I'll start to

3379.33 --> 3384.15
crave for raw milk if I started like

3381.1 --> 3387.58
yeah I'm gonna get like I'm doing goods

3384.15 --> 3390.61
I'm gonna try to step away from using

3387.58 --> 3392.92
cannabis and instead just really get fit

3390.61 --> 3397.1200000000003
and [ __ ] and maybe I'll have more people

3392.92 --> 3399.13
around me that'll enable me for to

3397.12 --> 3400.96
really get into that and stay into that

3399.13 --> 3402.35
and not feel isolated while I'll try

3400.96 --> 3403.55
that which wouldn't be very

3402.35 --> 3407.69
good for me it wouldn't be very

3403.55 --> 3411.4700000000003
encouraging I'd need like people to do

3407.69 --> 3413.33
that with really like yeah maybe I just

3411.47 --> 3415.16
need to get like back into a certain

3413.33 --> 3416.66
type of sports that used to work for me

3415.16 --> 3418.5499999999997
really well in the past so maybe it's

3416.66 --> 3421.1
just time like okay get back into some

3418.55 --> 3422.9900000000002
kind of sports but yet it costs so not

3421.1 --> 3424.88
yet but I'll do it and then when I'll do

3422.99 --> 3429.1699999999996
it it's a great like it would be like I

3424.88 --> 3431.96
I need milk I don't know why maybe

3429.17 --> 3435.41
because I'm doing more so then I'll just

3431.96 --> 3439.25
see like okay where where as an organic

3435.41 --> 3441.47
farm wit that that could get me wrong

3439.25 --> 3444.2
milk and then I'll get into that really

3441.47 --> 3451.7
quickly I'll try it out and over a part

3444.2 --> 3453.9399999999996
on it oh god no not war Merle don't do

3451.7 --> 3453.9399999999996
that

3460.03 --> 3468.099
that

3461.859 --> 3470.229
oh my god people don't don't declare war

3468.099 --> 3472.529
on me dude you don't know what you're

3470.229 --> 3472.529
doing

3477.93 --> 3487.89
just just enjoy doing what you're doing

3481.77 --> 3493.349
in you don't go there man it's not good

3487.89 --> 3496.95
for you it's not good for me either it's

3493.349 --> 3498.9
like tacky look if you're gonna keep on

3496.95 --> 3502.6499999999996
pushing me with this [ __ ] Mauro I will

3498.9 --> 3505.339
really start to get more rough and I

3502.65 --> 3505.339
don't want to

3506.42 --> 3518.609
so please just stop pushing it said I

3514.68 --> 3520.94
don't think you're an evil guy just get

3518.609 --> 3520.94
a grip

3523.98 --> 3527.21
[Music]

3541.99 --> 3548.2599999999998
hmm I think you're wrong right now I'm

3545.5 --> 3552.25
afraid that Moreau was probably not

3548.26 --> 3555.4500000000003
joking he gets like that as I told you

3552.25 --> 3558.07
the guy has no control over his feelings

3555.45 --> 3560.2
feelings start to arrive they take him

3558.07 --> 3564.2200000000003
over and he suddenly starts to see that

3560.2 --> 3565.48
as reality so I think he really means it

3564.22 --> 3575.9199999999996
and that's his problem

3565.48 --> 3578.28
oh wow yeah it's already past three I

3575.92 --> 3581.4300000000003
hadn't even noticed just kept on going
