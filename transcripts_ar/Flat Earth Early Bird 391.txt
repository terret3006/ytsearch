242.68 --> 248.59
fun there were a lot of good streams

244.15 --> 250.78
like it during like 12 o'clock my time

248.59 --> 254.53
and they all just came all at once on

250.78 --> 258.19
YouTube and on D life like 4/5 streams

254.53 --> 260.859
at the same time was a bit tough to

258.19 --> 261.609
choose but yeah ran T's was just freakin

260.859 --> 270.13
hilarious

261.609 --> 272.13899999999995

270.13 --> 276.27
wasn't to give me like full belly

laughter was so funny

276.57 --> 279.649
[Music]

283.24 --> 292.72
yeah yeah Karen B look even in my my

289.6 --> 295.47900000000004
comment section from yesterday this guy

292.72 --> 298.84000000000003
who came in I think like two weeks ago

295.479 --> 301.3
in chat some time think I've ended up

298.84 --> 304.06
banning him for good reason because in

301.3 --> 311.38
my chat he is just being such a global

304.06 --> 314.68
troll I try to comment but apparently I

311.38 --> 318.009
can't use the freaking f-word in my own

314.68 --> 322.57
comment section as the actual owner of

318.009 --> 332.16900000000004
the channel like what the hell

322.57 --> 335.83
but anyway it's just so ridiculous first

332.169 --> 337.9
yeah Jeff Brown volcano image first he

335.83 --> 342.55
declares it Nathan Oakley is not a

337.9 --> 345.52
flatterer theory it's just I don't even

342.55 --> 349.87
know why people do that anymore you know

345.52 --> 352.78
what what do you define as a flat

349.87 --> 356.979
earther I think a flat earther is

352.78 --> 360.75899999999996
somebody that well talks about defense

356.979 --> 364.09
research research is flat earth on a

360.759 --> 366.61
regular basis and I think Nathan kind of

364.09 --> 368.289
falls in that category so if you're just

366.61 --> 369.759
gonna call them if Nathan a not

368.289 --> 372.21
flattered that means that you're

369.759 --> 376.68
literally drowning in your own delusion

372.21 --> 376.68
that's why I responded with to him I

376.8 --> 383.56
know you're delusional to say something

380.02 --> 385.33
as ridiculous is that for you to truly

383.56 --> 387.31
believe someone like Nathan Oakley is

385.33 --> 388.50899999999996
not a flat earther everything everything

387.31 --> 390.07
that's happened in the last four years

388.509 --> 391.659
you might want to keep banging your head

390.07 --> 395.199
against the wall until but these

391.659 --> 396.969
delusions delusional thoughts stop and

395.199 --> 400.57
then of course you had to reflect that

396.969 --> 405.19
right back to me flat earth is the

400.57 --> 409.479
internet snake oil urn why haven't you

405.19 --> 413.01
done this why haven't you done that it's

409.479 --> 417.699
always the same [ __ ] with these people

413.01 --> 422.08
it's like the the further they go in

417.699 --> 425.349
denial down the line they always do the

422.08 --> 427.99
same things always always the same

425.349 --> 431.74
expression of delusion it's always the

427.99 --> 434.949
same they do the same switch arounds

431.74 --> 439.77
with individuals they place their denial

434.949 --> 442.599
on everything and then they blame us for

439.77 --> 445.33
basically not being in control of the

442.599 --> 450.55
world in order to outright use finances

445.33 --> 453.159
to prove all that [ __ ] and yeah and as

450.55 --> 455.5
far as flat is curved Iran to Flat Earth

453.159 --> 458.469
indeed yeah rumpus was pretty special

455.5 --> 461.26
with that but it's our base flat the

458.469 --> 463.449
earth is flat but it's actually supposed

461.26 --> 464.51
to not be flat it's all just looking

463.449 --> 467.69
perfectly flat

464.51 --> 469.01
and our based refraction makes it all

467.69 --> 471.29
look perfectly flat

469.01 --> 474.59
according to rumpus who is very

471.29 --> 478.72
blatantly of open about it almost like

474.59 --> 481.7
proud and other ballers seem to kind of

478.72 --> 483.92
not think about it a lot because it is

481.7 --> 487.78999999999996
so delusional to believe something like

483.92 --> 490.16
that that instead of hey you can see it

487.79 --> 493.6
because it's there it's very far away

490.16 --> 497.90000000000003
you shouldn't see that if it wasn't flat

493.6 --> 501.85
well it is flat but yeah Globus can't

497.9 --> 505.46
handle that so they had to bend it all

501.85 --> 507.94
into a flat plane froman's a presupposed

505.46 --> 510.10999999999996
actual ball and that's where we are now

507.94 --> 513.08
that's where they are and that's where

510.11 --> 518.33
they'll stay and they'll they'll even

513.08 --> 520.729
become less shameful about that

518.33 --> 524.96
standpoint because there's no other way

520.729 --> 528.1700000000001
for them they have to reinforce absolute

524.96 --> 532.25
reversed world illusion to make the flat

528.17 --> 536.27
the obviously flat world into a ball

532.25 --> 539.33
they must do that so they will be forced

536.27 --> 543.65
down that road of just absolute vile

539.33 --> 547.1600000000001
delusional behavior unless they kind of

543.65 --> 550.63
step away but yeah some people just

547.16 --> 550.63
can't step away now can they

559.64 --> 565.85
oh yeah Ronde flattered I I don't know

562.459 --> 567.7399999999999
about zenki Zhen Garcia's case I saw

565.85 --> 573.64
something about it for a minute

567.74 --> 573.64
it seems oh very technical but I guess

574.87 --> 583.43
they keep going after him

578.47 --> 588.7090000000001
and he keeps winning I didn't get out of

583.43 --> 592.0889999999999
that I didn't get that part of it I

588.709 --> 592.0889999999999
didn't really watch it all the way

603.63 --> 606.6899999999999
[Music]

607.49 --> 613.99
anyway sometimes for me it feels like

610.99 --> 613.99
just

616.19 --> 622.0690000000001
the nuisance of the ball or delusions

619.759 --> 624.29
that I'm constantly being subjected to

622.069 --> 626.36
the [ __ ] that they constantly want to

624.29 --> 635.42
shove in my face every chance they get

626.36 --> 637.129
it is yeah I wonder sometimes well I

635.42 --> 642.139
don't wonder it's rather more like a

637.129 --> 645.23
choice because it does seem like a big

642.139 --> 649.069
distraction like their delusions seem

645.23 --> 652.129
like a huge distraction to me because

649.069 --> 655.91
I'm not that perfect either in my world

652.129 --> 658.6990000000001
in in my life in the yeah what I know

655.91 --> 661.55
about Flat Earth what I do here I do

658.699 --> 664.3389999999999
pretty damn well I think I'm technically

661.55 --> 666.92
correct I might not be the most

664.339 --> 669.889
appealing character on the internet

666.92 --> 673.16
although I tend to like downplay myself

669.889 --> 675.259
a bit but at least I'm very confident in

673.16 --> 679.9699999999999
the things that I know and how I argue

675.259 --> 681.86
them very very confident and well that

679.97 --> 684.4390000000001
confidence seemed to be something I'm

681.86 --> 686.1800000000001
just upholding us like at least I'm good

684.439 --> 690.3499999999999
at that because when I look at the rest

686.18 --> 695.42
of my life I feel pretty damn lousy

690.35 --> 699.529
sometimes but that's only from what I

695.42 --> 701.66
want and expect from life because if I

699.529 --> 704.899
then try to compare it to other people

701.66 --> 707.449
then I guess I'm not that bad because

704.899 --> 709.149
man there's so many messed up people in

707.449 --> 712.399
this world and so many people that

709.149 --> 714.769
seemingly have a normal life but they're

712.399 --> 717.759
just stumbling around and making like

714.769 --> 722.839
massive idiotic mistakes everywhere and

717.759 --> 724.79
people don't even notice it so but yeah

722.839 --> 726.8290000000001
I don't really try to compare my life

724.79 --> 729.23
with others because that would only make

726.829 --> 732.17
me more sloppy that would be the effect

729.23 --> 733.91
that I originally as a teenager started

732.17 --> 737.5999999999999
to buy into and that is well this world

733.91 --> 739.399
is so messed up everybody's so dumb it

737.6 --> 741.769
doesn't matter if I'm gonna do it as

739.399 --> 745.22
good as I can because nobody would even

741.769 --> 747.38
notice it and that kind of drugged me

745.22 --> 749.119
down and I can't do that

747.38 --> 751.459
I I mustn't do that

749.119 --> 753.679
I can't compare myself to the average

751.459 --> 758.289
person I just can't do that because I am

753.679 --> 761.049
NOT the average person I have other

758.289 --> 765.019
another balance of talents and skills

761.049 --> 767.149
and I need to uphold my own standards to

765.019 --> 772.869
reflect those talents and skills

767.149 --> 772.869
properly and it's tough sometimes

773.259 --> 781.269
because with everything that I am that

776.419 --> 786.3489999999999
it comes a lot of like really deep bad

781.269 --> 791.839
feelings and I don't even really always

786.349 --> 796.369
know how to handle that I manage a good

791.839 --> 799.9090000000001
walk there's a lot of good sometimes my

796.369 --> 802.279
ego kind of needs to assert itself and I

799.909 --> 804.369
don't do that try to do that as far away

802.279 --> 808.039
as possible and then I for example just

804.369 --> 812.4490000000001
like scream not screeching scream but

808.039 --> 815.209
rather without creeping people out and

812.449 --> 818.5889999999999
basically just yell very loud something

815.209 --> 825.5889999999999
to assert my dominance like for example

818.589 --> 827.719
like I don't care about mmm don't take

825.589 --> 829.4590000000001
this as a wrong babe but originally I

827.719 --> 830.769
was thinking like yeah I have so many

829.459 --> 834.829
issues

830.769 --> 837.199
who wants a family with me like am I

834.829 --> 839.569
even suitable for procreation yeah maybe

837.199 --> 841.9989999999999
smart yeah I may technically function as

839.569 --> 844.0989999999999
a good father in some way but are these

841.999 --> 847.399
genetics supposed to be passed on I was

844.099 --> 849.619
really negative towards myself I thought

847.399 --> 853.129
okay while my brother at least has a

849.619 --> 856.369
family so it's okay

853.129 --> 859.5790000000001
but every time I think about it now I

856.369 --> 863.719
get really pissed off and I'm like no

859.579 --> 869.7389999999999
screw that screw what they do I have to

863.719 --> 869.739
do this I want my family I shouldn't

872.51 --> 880.95
constantly drag what other people do

876.15 --> 882.99
into my own life route decision-making I

880.95 --> 894.3000000000001
shouldn't do that not even of my own

882.99 --> 897.42
close family huh mark color yeah boy

894.3 --> 899.8199999999999
it's it's discouraged to get children

897.42 --> 904.05
when you're young even when I was young

899.82 --> 907.44
issue is only that I did kind of always

904.05 --> 911.2199999999999
want children problem is I didn't want

907.44 --> 914.34
to work I didn't want a freaking job and

911.22 --> 919.08
then like be enslaved by that and no

914.34 --> 921.57
longer have any mood energy left or yeah

919.08 --> 923.5200000000001
to properly for example be a father I

921.57 --> 925.86
saw that as a problem like who if I

923.52 --> 929.46
really get this freaking job whatever

925.86 --> 932.13
job and then have family at home how can

929.46 --> 934.88
I be a good dad that way it's just me

932.13 --> 939.21
I'm making it very complex for myself

934.88 --> 941.28
but yeah my view on what it would be

939.21 --> 943.32
like to get a family was kind of

941.28 --> 946.1999999999999
primitive back then and now I'm seeing

943.32 --> 948.5100000000001
and I'm learning so much from other

946.2 --> 950.88
people and have seeing how they deal

948.51 --> 954.21
with having children and being freaking

950.88 --> 957.53
jealous of it yeah every time it's my

954.21 --> 962.01
problem it's my problem that I'm jealous

957.53 --> 963.81
but I am like pretty much every person

962.01 --> 968.06
that I follow on the Internet has

963.81 --> 971.55
frickin kids now turns out to be and

968.06 --> 974.13
every time I'm like oh and then I feel

971.55 --> 978.4499999999999
like yeah I can't even I can't even

974.13 --> 981.48
allow myself to basically enjoy that

978.45 --> 985.5
because it would kind of draw me away

981.48 --> 987.69
from actually just getting it myself

985.5 --> 991.14
like I don't know maybe it's because I'm

987.69 --> 995.0400000000001
near 40 this is maybe this is my midlife

991.14 --> 998.55
crisis or whatever but it always turns

995.04 --> 999.8199999999999
out to be you know it's like the guys

998.55 --> 1002.2199999999999
out there

999.82 --> 1005.49
and the gals without especially the guys

1002.22 --> 1013.59
out there with kids just they appeal so

1005.49 --> 1017.79
much more to me yeah get a puppy instead

1013.59 --> 1022.0500000000001
no no I do see you other people getting

1017.79 --> 1025.83
pets are loneliness even so yeah here in

1022.05 --> 1033.18
in this area and there is a lot of

1025.83 --> 1035.6399999999999
lonely people but there's nothing really

1033.18 --> 1039.77
that can be done about it I think

1035.64 --> 1042.5400000000002
sometimes it's just because of the

1039.77 --> 1046.2
cultural decisions that everyone has

1042.54 --> 1051.03
made it it's it's the lack of family

1046.2 --> 1054.69
cohesion that causes this and you can

1051.03 --> 1057.3899999999999
then say oh I'll help out I'll be that

1054.69 --> 1061.77
support but there's so many people out

1057.39 --> 1064.1100000000001
there is it's undoable everybody it's

1061.77 --> 1065.85
getting worse by the way too and it

1064.11 --> 1069.84
really is the fault of the lack of

1065.85 --> 1076.11
family cohesion that families basically

1069.84 --> 1079.35
dump their parents and they have no

1076.11 --> 1083.28
issue with it even and that's terrible

1079.35 --> 1086.81
it's terrible and that is really primary

1083.28 --> 1092.16
cause of the plague of loneliness is

1086.81 --> 1094.8
that people abandon their family they

1092.16 --> 1097.71
just see oh it's just a burden I don't

1094.8 --> 1100.9099999999999
have time for that or or I don't really

1097.71 --> 1100.91
know what to do about it

1102.59 --> 1109.05
yeah that's home Parker yeah I know I

1104.91 --> 1113.13
know look I am looking around and I'm

1109.05 --> 1115.05
learning I'm learning a lot you I talked

1113.13 --> 1116.46
about a bit on here but especially on

1115.05 --> 1118.68
the phone had a really good phone

1116.46 --> 1122.31
conversation again with my friend that I

1118.68 --> 1124.78
went out with to in Rotterdam about also

1122.31 --> 1128.95
what happened in Rotterdam our met

1124.78 --> 1131.08
basically two girls and to meet it's so

1128.95 --> 1134.41
funny when I really do something out

1131.08 --> 1136.9299999999998
there it's almost like it becomes a

1134.41 --> 1142.8100000000002
study afterwards because I don't go out

1136.93 --> 1144.4
very much and and I do in this case it

1142.81 --> 1146.98
was very interesting because basically

1144.4 --> 1149.8000000000002
there were two girls that caught my

1146.98 --> 1153.76
interest one was somebody he bumped into

1149.8 --> 1157.4199999999998
like immediately and she like looked me

1153.76 --> 1160.69
in the face and smiled straight and I

1157.42 --> 1163.1200000000001
was kind of like it it's like blue like

1160.69 --> 1165.16
oh you are nice but it's like blinding

1163.12 --> 1167.62
ah I need to step away it was too much

1165.16 --> 1171.16
and as odd because that girl was

1167.62 --> 1173.77
probably great and then I go walking

1171.16 --> 1177.5400000000002
around and then I find a less available

1173.77 --> 1180.43
woman with complications and that's like

1177.54 --> 1183.58
in a process that sneaked into me it's

1180.43 --> 1188.0800000000002
kind of my type I seek out complicated

1183.58 --> 1190.57
cases that don't forward so much energy

1188.08 --> 1192.3899999999999
in me that don't just trade out contact

1190.57 --> 1195.37
me into the core of my soul and

1192.39 --> 1198.5200000000002
overwhelm me no I seek out the women

1195.37 --> 1201.58
that I have issues obviously and then

1198.52 --> 1204.49
work my way slowly and kind of test it

1201.58 --> 1206.1399999999999
out and then usually end up stepping

1204.49 --> 1209.29
away because they do turn out to be

1206.14 --> 1211.15
pretty nutty don't really want to Dan

1209.29 --> 1216.52
tangle with that but that is kind of

1211.15 --> 1218.17
like a social issue of mine and I need

1216.52 --> 1219.91
to figure out how to deal with it

1218.17 --> 1222.97
because otherwise I'll just keep on

1219.91 --> 1227.5800000000002
missing those potentially dude women I

1222.97 --> 1227.58
need some way to deal with this

1229.84 --> 1237.289
women want security well in order to

1235.97 --> 1240.38
begin a family

1237.289 --> 1244.12
yeah damn you then well believe they

1240.38 --> 1249.41
need security for that but in primarily

1244.12 --> 1254.0
women really wants somebody that well

1249.41 --> 1257.809
that that gets them in a way that they

1254.0 --> 1262.82
really need where most people fail at it

1257.809 --> 1266.78
or choose not to see that connection

1262.82 --> 1272.12
that's what I've noticed but then again

1266.78 --> 1276.32
I am a very personal and elaborate

1272.12 --> 1280.01
character type person and that will be

1276.32 --> 1283.8999999999999
typically what what will drawn to me and

1280.01 --> 1283.9
what yeah it's just what I do and

1291.16 --> 1303.13
anyway I'm thinking about it a lot and

1298.27 --> 1305.8899999999999
noticing just how incredibly much

1303.13 --> 1308.5
especially on the social interaction

1305.89 --> 1311.92
level I've learned to take for granted

1308.5 --> 1315.31
and set myself in a certain structural

1311.92 --> 1317.5
response that seems kind of sensible but

1315.31 --> 1320.1399999999999
because of these processes that have

1317.5 --> 1322.66
ingrained themselves in how I represent

1320.14 --> 1324.73
myself how I deal with people it does

1322.66 --> 1329.65
keep me in balance it does keep me kind

1324.73 --> 1336.88
of protected but it makes it a little

1329.65 --> 1342.63
bit tough to for example to get in the

1336.88 --> 1346.0300000000002
middle of like a friend circle because

1342.63 --> 1348.73
especially typically these days friends

1346.03 --> 1351.6399999999999
circle culture which is like on top of

1348.73 --> 1358.99
each individual and everybody has to

1351.64 --> 1361.48
find themselves in that besides the Flat

1358.99 --> 1366.55
Earth scene pretty much there's almost

1361.48 --> 1370.42
no friend group cultures that I can bear

1366.55 --> 1372.76
to handle anymore every time whether it

1370.42 --> 1376.0
be guys or girls or some mixed group

1372.76 --> 1381.31
it's always going in certain directions

1376.0 --> 1388.41
and it's just so annoying to me that I

1381.31 --> 1388.4099999999999
don't find exceptions anymore yeah

1392.61 --> 1403.2299999999998
well Karen B if only I tried that with

1398.83 --> 1403.23
my ax it doesn't really always work

1410.059 --> 1413.059
yeah

1416.659 --> 1434.1190000000001
oh yeah okay sure Karen b-but I don't

1429.799 --> 1436.489
know yeah I guess you're right

1434.119 --> 1439.129
the issue with me is it's kind of

1436.489 --> 1442.009
default for me and I have to be careful

1439.129 --> 1444.379
not to do it too much because I have

1442.009 --> 1447.369
tendencies to be very worshipful in a

1444.379 --> 1456.1999999999998
relation and it's not actually that good

1447.369 --> 1459.1689999999999
if if yeah it's hard to cut hard to

1456.2 --> 1465.769
explain it's just that I tend to be kind

1459.169 --> 1467.5990000000002
of fanatical like I even did this with

1465.769 --> 1470.629
my ex and she thought it was weird that

1467.599 --> 1473.269
I did it and in retrospect it is weird

1470.629 --> 1474.9189999999999
that I do it but it's like this longing

1473.269 --> 1477.44
that needs fulfilling it and it is

1474.919 --> 1480.1090000000002
worship in a way that I would literally

1477.44 --> 1483.289
like make stance or do something like

1480.109 --> 1488.269
very fanatically to basically prove how

1483.289 --> 1491.45
much I'm in love with her like like a

1488.269 --> 1493.97
knight the didn't that's very serious

1491.45 --> 1496.039
for me but it she thought it was it

1493.97 --> 1499.34
shows that she thought it was kind of

1496.039 --> 1506.529
theatrically charming but didn't really

1499.34 --> 1510.59
get it too clingy

1506.529 --> 1511.309
yeah too clingy too distant so it's kind

1510.59 --> 1513.4399999999998
of difficult

1511.309 --> 1517.399
that way it's true you have to it's

1513.44 --> 1519.8890000000001
always finding a balance and I don't

1517.399 --> 1524.9189999999999
know I can be both I can be very clingy

1519.889 --> 1524.9189999999999
I can be very distant it all depends

1532.659 --> 1537.7600000000002
mm-hmm

1535.15 --> 1541.1100000000001
Oh seeking star water that sounds really

1537.76 --> 1541.11
depressing sorry to hear that

1547.47 --> 1552.28
Wow

1548.74 --> 1556.33
look with me in my prospects for my

1552.28 --> 1559.48
future it's difficult but it's not

1556.33 --> 1563.3799999999999
undoable in the sense that I am a man so

1559.48 --> 1567.22
I could still have viable children even

1563.38 --> 1571.3600000000001
the next 10 years problem is is that as

1567.22 --> 1574.42
I grow older then the work-energy may

1571.36 --> 1577.1789999999999
lessen and I might damn well need that

1574.42 --> 1580.29
if I'm going to be having a family

1577.179 --> 1583.63
getting some financial traction and and

1580.29 --> 1589.8999999999999
being responsible and I hope I could

1583.63 --> 1592.21
take that because I don't know I it

1589.9 --> 1595.9
maybe it's that I underestimate myself

1592.21 --> 1601.75
or I can't just feel out what I can do

1595.9 --> 1603.97
but I just feel like I grow weaker but

1601.75 --> 1606.48
then again at other times it's just so

1603.97 --> 1606.48
much energy

1614.75 --> 1621.98
wow that is amazing flattered spaceman

1617.96 --> 1625.309
so that's so good to hear well I'd

1621.98 --> 1628.76
certainly I'd certainly get in line a

1625.309 --> 1632.5
little bit more if I got kids I'm pretty

1628.76 --> 1635.87
sure I I am kind of like hoping for that

1632.5 --> 1637.25
yeah that boost everybody talks about

1635.87 --> 1646.01
that has had children

1637.25 --> 1649.01
I really hope I'll get it but I'm not

1646.01 --> 1652.96
too sure on the other hand yeah it's

1649.01 --> 1659.12
like if I keep on thinking about that

1652.96 --> 1663.799
maybe I should I really do feel I have a

1659.12 --> 1666.62
future here with with YouTube and maybe

1663.799 --> 1670.1299999999999
do you life as a character here on the

1666.62 --> 1675.3799999999999
internet doing what I do open for

1670.13 --> 1679.73
display and inquiry I think it is viable

1675.38 --> 1684.95
what I do but it I sometimes just don't

1679.73 --> 1686.9
see where I'll go I don't see any moment

1684.95 --> 1689.2
when suddenly the cash starts flowing

1686.9 --> 1691.52
for real kind of thing it's just and

1689.2 --> 1694.28
everything so far has been growing so

1691.52 --> 1697.0
slowly now of course that was kind of

1694.28 --> 1697.0
predicted and

1699.94 --> 1704.6200000000001
and it's always the same story and

1702.16 --> 1706.51
Randy's been telling me this and it's

1704.62 --> 1709.0
I've listened to you Randy

1706.51 --> 1712.18
like you got to put it in more you got a

1709.0 --> 1716.08
you got to expand but I also got to be

1712.18 --> 1719.3500000000001
able to maintain that and again I feel

1716.08 --> 1723.73
on orality yeah in relation to some

1719.35 --> 1727.3899999999999
other people I kind of feel weak I don't

1723.73 --> 1730.66
have all that that ambitious energy that

1727.39 --> 1734.1100000000001
can really just propel it forward I

1730.66 --> 1738.16
haven't gotten that so far I have

1734.11 --> 1744.51
moments I have very strong inspiration

1738.16 --> 1744.51
and then it passes and I move on

1748.34 --> 1755.73
while cept a pee-pee splat form for this

1753.48 --> 1757.58
time slot it's not a great time for

1755.73 --> 1760.04
debates

1757.58 --> 1763.05
it is a morning breakfast show

1760.04 --> 1767.97
technically that's what it's what it was

1763.05 --> 1771.1499999999999
meant to be and it's not the right time

1767.97 --> 1773.28
slot for actual debating it but I have

1771.15 --> 1776.49
thought about I've definitely considered

1773.28 --> 1778.77
doing something else like well

1776.49 --> 1780.42
continuing the night owl series but

1778.77 --> 1784.05
still I don't know if I could maintain

1780.42 --> 1789.45
that and the early work show at the same

1784.05 --> 1794.57
time twice a day that's a lot that's a

1789.45 --> 1794.57
lot for anyone even a real professional

1811.87 --> 1819.1589999999999
that's ridiculous Ragnar Stefan audition

1815.37 --> 1822.1299999999999
the meaning of life what you think I can

1819.159 --> 1825.429
spend hours and hours just talking about

1822.13 --> 1828.69
the meaning of life the whole meaning of

1825.429 --> 1831.25
life is liberal [ __ ] it's of

1828.69 --> 1832.96
philosophical nonsense if you're

1831.25 --> 1835.26
pondering the meaning of life then you

1832.96 --> 1837.3700000000001
don't understand what the realm is I

1835.26 --> 1842.95
don't know the meaning of life seem

1837.37 --> 1845.85
blatantly obvious to me I've talked

1842.95 --> 1845.8500000000001
about it regularly

1850.44 --> 1856.2
then yeah

1853.3 --> 1858.52
not talking about conspiracy while

1856.2 --> 1860.8300000000002
conspiracy is everywhere it is of this

1858.52 --> 1865.27
time it is happening it's getting opened

1860.83 --> 1867.85
up it's being weaponized utilized in a

1865.27 --> 1872.3799999999999
very destructive cultural way by

1867.85 --> 1876.01
individuals choosing that [ __ ] as well

1872.38 --> 1878.14
choosing to be devious very nasty just

1876.01 --> 1883.09
to be on top it's just a cultural

1878.14 --> 1888.19
pollution to no end and even the meaning

1883.09 --> 1891.07
of life is they are attempting to alter

1888.19 --> 1893.8600000000001
it and to take it away too and

1891.07 --> 1896.47
effectively taking away logos taking

1893.86 --> 1898.36
away the true original design purpose

1896.47 --> 1900.82
and what is right what is wrong

1898.36 --> 1903.82
they're railing at all it's a conspiracy

1900.82 --> 1905.4099999999999
so I don't know why I should be talking

1903.82 --> 1908.04
about the meaning of life instead of

1905.41 --> 1911.0400000000002
conspiracies that seems kind of

1908.04 --> 1911.04
contradictory

1922.19 --> 1930.8700000000001
yeah Karen B well I long for the day

1928.17 --> 1934.3100000000002
that I could have some kind of garden

1930.87 --> 1934.31
available to me again

1962.67 --> 1971.22
I get a allotment we're talking the

1967.26 --> 1973.7
Netherlands here right yeah in in the

1971.22 --> 1976.74
United States getting a garden is

1973.7 --> 1979.02
literally like throwing a rock and you

1976.74 --> 1980.7
got a giant square a land that nobody

1979.02 --> 1984.57
cares about and you can do pretty much

1980.7 --> 1986.67
whatever with what you want until the

1984.57 --> 1989.6399999999999
Federals come and get in your way or

1986.67 --> 1993.3000000000002
whatever in the Netherlands there is no

1989.64 --> 1996.8000000000002
room it's all comparatively it's all a

1993.3 --> 2003.01
giant city-state all of it with some

1996.8 --> 2003.01
forms in between right in England

2003.52 --> 2011.78
England is also pretty crowded not as

2008.18 --> 2015.53
bad as the Netherlands though except for

2011.78 --> 2021.59
London London is pretty freaky folks

2015.53 --> 2023.03
thank you yeah well there are I've even

2021.59 --> 2027.58
been offered that there are like these

2023.03 --> 2031.22
project things where you could share

2027.58 --> 2038.09
like a garden but there's no control

2031.22 --> 2041.99
over it so if somebody just chose to to

2038.09 --> 2045.74
do whatever poison it or [ __ ] or yeah

2041.99 --> 2047.66
use some kind of crap on their plants it

2045.74 --> 2050.75
would rub off on mine and I'm screwed

2047.66 --> 2054.7000000000003
nobody would even tell me so I'd want my

2050.75 --> 2057.71
own garden with a fence mine all mine

2054.7 --> 2063.56
don't want anyone to be allowed in their

2057.71 --> 2067.19
mine not some shared thing that's

2063.56 --> 2070.04
useless hmm

2067.19 --> 2072.05
yeah you told me Anna killed oh yeah

2070.04 --> 2074.74
it's better in the east there's more

2072.05 --> 2074.7400000000002
room over there

2086.36 --> 2094.15
right

2088.61 --> 2098.6
well before I even consider like

2094.15 --> 2101.3
consider moving anywhere I have to get

2098.6 --> 2105.44
to some kind of financial viable level

2101.3 --> 2108.23
because yeah this may be almost kind of

2105.44 --> 2110.42
like a prison financially to me that I'm

2108.23 --> 2112.58
here but this is actually a great place

2110.42 --> 2115.96
to be imprisoned at because I got a

2112.58 --> 2119.48
great few got a lot of green around me I

2115.96 --> 2122.69
got organic supermarket in reach so it

2119.48 --> 2124.88
is ideal and to like oh my god escape

2122.69 --> 2127.76
gotta go somewhere else I'm pretty sure

2124.88 --> 2132.82
I'm gonna end up at a worse place unless

2127.76 --> 2132.82
I have more finances available to me

2133.66 --> 2139.58
yeah gorillas growing I thought about it

2136.34 --> 2143.27
as well it's that's gonna be very tough

2139.58 --> 2145.75
in the Netherlands I'd have to go pretty

2143.27 --> 2145.75
far away

2150.53 --> 2154.7900000000004
okay Ragnar Stefan all the time

2158.45 --> 2166.71
okay sure well if you got some kind of

2162.75 --> 2170.46
proposition please set yeah tell me in

2166.71 --> 2174.53
Skype that would be great I am open for

2170.46 --> 2179.43
propositions always have been okay

2174.53 --> 2182.4900000000002
always have been especially if it's

2179.43 --> 2186.4199999999996
media related like I'm I'm pretty much

2182.49 --> 2189.08
just saying yeah if anybody has some

2186.42 --> 2192.15
kind of job that I think I could do I

2189.08 --> 2194.33
will absolutely consider it I'll hear

2192.15 --> 2194.33
you out

2200.42 --> 2208.779
here is ice and oh [ __ ] hmm

2214.489 --> 2223.65
interesting although the Iceland bit

2221.519 --> 2226.41
complicated it's very different country

2223.65 --> 2231.2090000000003
I I'd have to it's not something I've

2226.41 --> 2232.949
just easily decide upon I didn't know

2231.209 --> 2237.769
you lived in Iceland I thought you were

2232.949 --> 2237.7690000000002
German or something okay

2249.86 --> 2255.23
hmm

2251.57 --> 2260.06
yeah Robin Stanley makes sense although

2255.23 --> 2263.33
for me even with loving groups I need a

2260.06 --> 2264.92
lot of solitary time because yeah if I'm

2263.33 --> 2267.14
in the middle of negative group

2264.92 --> 2269.84
influences yeah damn I'll need my

2267.14 --> 2273.5
solitary time just to recover but even

2269.84 --> 2275.69
if it's a lot of positivity I still need

2273.5 --> 2277.97
a lot of personal time so I'm not the

2275.69 --> 2280.1
individual that's like always hanging

2277.97 --> 2283.6
around in groups absolutely now never

2280.1 --> 2283.6
have been even as little kid

2292.81 --> 2296.82
but anyway yeah ooh

2297.22 --> 2305.0499999999997
working in the greenhouse is a good

2299.58 --> 2308.58
meditative career I can't imagine so it

2305.05 --> 2308.5800000000004
sounds very therapeutical

2335.49 --> 2342.4799999999996
yeah yeah reasonable logic if I could

2338.49 --> 2348.6299999999997
answer that question that I wouldn't be

2342.48 --> 2354.42
where I was right now if I if I had a

2348.63 --> 2356.4
dream job do you think I'd be here where

2354.42 --> 2358.17
I am yeah the problem was when his

2356.4 --> 2361.11
little kid my dream job was being an

2358.17 --> 2366.32
astronaut and I was never really

2361.11 --> 2366.32
dissuade it from that but I guess

2366.68 --> 2374.97
ironically enough what I do now it's

2371.94 --> 2375.42
kind of that although I'm not fooling

2374.97 --> 2380.1899999999996
people

2375.42 --> 2384.7400000000002
I am busying with that and doing stories

2380.19 --> 2387.4700000000003
and getting good at stories and and

2384.74 --> 2391.5
conceptualizations which is technically

2387.47 --> 2394.4399999999996
what they do just they do it to fool

2391.5 --> 2396.75
people I do it to clear things up that's

2394.44 --> 2399.27
the difference but in a way ironically

2396.75 --> 2402.9
and I kind of did become this astronaut

2399.27 --> 2405.81
it's just not the way that I thought it

2402.9 --> 2407.1
was gonna be and I'm not making a lot of

2405.81 --> 2410.64
money from it

2407.1 --> 2414.86
astronauts do but other than that I

2410.64 --> 2418.02
never nothing really appealed to me like

2414.86 --> 2420.44
not really not something I'd be doing

2418.02 --> 2420.44
forever

2423.83 --> 2430.75
yeah I know her killed up that's what

2426.17 --> 2430.75
they do astronauts tell stories so

2432.43 --> 2437.08
ironically enough even though I thought

2435.74 --> 2442.04
it was all real

2437.08 --> 2445.79
it did appeal to me it did appeal to me

2442.04 --> 2450.46
I guess to be one of the guys that knows

2445.79 --> 2457.88
a lot and can tell these amazing stories

2450.46 --> 2459.86
that appealed to me even though it

2457.88 --> 2466.28
turned out to all be [ __ ] or most of

2459.86 --> 2475.55
it or a lot of it our winstram and no no

2466.28 --> 2477.23
no no it's just terrible if you're gonna

2475.55 --> 2482.32
if you're gonna are win a fight then

2477.23 --> 2482.32
just call it an Arab or not come on

2493.859 --> 2500.58
I'm the Explorer of the inner Arwen and

2497.44 --> 2500.58
in our way not

2528.9 --> 2543.6600000000003
that's that's interesting story Robin

2531.239 --> 2547.9990000000003
Stanley you know what okay yeah you know

2543.66 --> 2551.1299999999997
what I always well due to a lack of a

2547.999 --> 2553.859
perspective on a real job I especially

2551.13 --> 2557.549
during my teenagers teenage times really

2553.859 --> 2561.779
thought of myself so liberal as an

2557.549 --> 2564.719
artist as somebody who would be artistic

2561.779 --> 2566.88
and I didn't really know how yet because

2564.719 --> 2571.319
I wasn't like this mega painter or

2566.88 --> 2573.719
anything I was more like a designer and

2571.319 --> 2576.18
I would I would spend a lot of time

2573.719 --> 2581.039
weirdly enough like on paper designing

2576.18 --> 2582.93
games like you know from a puzzle like

2581.039 --> 2585.15
approach it still have the blueprints

2582.93 --> 2588.749
for it I think can technically still be

2585.15 --> 2591.17
programmed into a game but it's an old

2588.749 --> 2594.5589999999997
fashion type style with the grids and

2591.17 --> 2598.9500000000003
and very direct mechanics it's like a

2594.559 --> 2601.0190000000002
simulator type thing but I spend a lot

2598.95 --> 2603.239
of time on that and all of that never

2601.019 --> 2606.779
came from the ground I never became a

2603.239 --> 2608.219
game maker because it seemed like nobody

2606.779 --> 2610.46
cared about that

2608.219 --> 2613.2290000000003
like nobody was looking for somebody

2610.46 --> 2617.96
like me that would do things with it

2613.229 --> 2623.9689999999996
that I did they just wanted somebody to

2617.96 --> 2629.609
program 3d shoes all day you know that's

2623.969 --> 2632.88
this or just be this hardcore programmer

2629.609 --> 2633.44
and none of those things appeal to me at

2632.88 --> 2637.619
all

2633.44 --> 2642.059
so I kind of got lost in my in my artist

2637.619 --> 2644.7000000000003
artisan ship in my artistry and then

2642.059 --> 2647.6090000000004
kind of delve into gold smithing and now

2644.7 --> 2652.319
that was kind of fruitful but still as a

2647.609 --> 2655.2
profession turned out to be yeah a bit

2652.319 --> 2657.869
disappointing but I'm still very glad I

2655.2 --> 2661.5789999999997
got those skills and I will still be

2657.869 --> 2661.579
able to utilize them one way or another

2661.85 --> 2666.74
so much from that my metallurgy and all

2664.01 --> 2674.0600000000004
that and just practically working with

2666.74 --> 2678.95
metals and heat but as an artist I was

2674.06 --> 2684.68
always terrified of sharing my work in

2678.95 --> 2686.75
the sense that I would share it with

2684.68 --> 2688.64
people that I trusted and with friends

2686.75 --> 2692.12
like oh look at this and then explain it

2688.64 --> 2696.02
but it was always extremely frightened

2692.12 --> 2698.5699999999997
of leaving people's responses to their

2696.02 --> 2700.58
own in reflection to my work I was

2698.57 --> 2703.3700000000003
afraid of to hear what they would

2700.58 --> 2705.74
naturally respond with really like every

2703.37 --> 2707.45
single time every single freaking time

2705.74 --> 2709.79
so I would show it and then immediately

2707.45 --> 2713.29
try to fill it in for them it's a

2709.79 --> 2717.23
terrible tendency I'm the worst

2713.29 --> 2720.92
but I guess in a way that YouTube

2717.23 --> 2724.96
funnily enough has helped me to break

2720.92 --> 2724.96
that effect more than anything just

2726.82 --> 2733.55
because yeah when I show it here it's

2729.83 --> 2736.4
just bang anyone can see it I cannot see

2733.55 --> 2740.27
their faces I cannot hear their thoughts

2736.4 --> 2743.7200000000003
unless they put it in chat but that

2740.27 --> 2746.33
broke that effect finally so now I'm

2743.72 --> 2750.62
like yes screw what people think like

2746.33 --> 2754.7
literally why did I ever care about that

2750.62 --> 2756.7999999999997
when people are idiots they don't know

2754.7 --> 2759.2599999999998
what they're doing even in their basic

2756.8 --> 2762.4300000000003
responses a lot of the time often they

2759.26 --> 2765.5600000000004
don't even have the depth the depth of

2762.43 --> 2767.6299999999997
mind to properly respond to what I put

2765.56 --> 2771.02
in front of their faces so why would I

2767.63 --> 2771.59
give shits what people think about my

2771.02 --> 2776.02
stuff

2771.59 --> 2779.33
really unless it's is guys that I really

2776.02 --> 2780.86
that I'm in tune with like my followers

2779.33 --> 2783.7599999999998
here and a lot of people that I respect

2780.86 --> 2783.76
on the scene

2785.43 --> 2795.66
yeah but it did help me and but at the

2792.12 --> 2800.88
same time and this is another issue as I

2795.66 --> 2804.2999999999997
grew older I just have less artistic

2800.88 --> 2807.9
impulses it's almost like I couldn't

2804.3 --> 2811.38
afford that any more than to spend that

2807.9 --> 2815.4300000000003
energy on it so I had a lot of bad times

2811.38 --> 2819.38
as well and in a way almost because I

2815.43 --> 2821.5499999999997
used art as an escapism escapism from my

2819.38 --> 2825.78
responsibility literally and this has

2821.55 --> 2826.5
been a major curse on me like bad very

2825.78 --> 2830.3700000000003
bad

2826.5 --> 2835.89
it's it's weird how it works but when I

2830.37 --> 2838.5299999999997
was younger I I utilized moments of

2835.89 --> 2840.96
escapism of like stepping away of even

2838.53 --> 2845.7000000000003
not taking proper responsibility of

2840.96 --> 2849.66
something to like be selfish in that

2845.7 --> 2852.1499999999996
moment and then I would get fired up and

2849.66 --> 2856.1099999999997
God got all these inspirations and then

2852.15 --> 2858.78
I would basically use the neglect of my

2856.11 --> 2862.11
own life yeah that how freaky is that I

2858.78 --> 2865.23
would use the neglect of my own life to

2862.11 --> 2867.36
fuel my artistic processes and it worked

2865.23 --> 2871.35
actually really well especially when I

2867.36 --> 2873.9300000000003
was young but as I grew older I started

2871.35 --> 2876.9
to realize like why am I doing this I

2873.93 --> 2882.72
need to stop it but yeah as I stopped it

2876.9 --> 2885.75
so do the artistic bursts also basically

2882.72 --> 2888.18
stop they stopped and now my artistry

2885.75 --> 2891.33
seems to be more expressed in just how I

2888.18 --> 2893.6699999999996
go about my communication skills and in

2891.33 --> 2897.14
seeing jokes or funny memes in the

2893.67 --> 2901.86
moment that's where it's now coming from

2897.14 --> 2905.8799999999997
because I don't draw I really don't it's

2901.86 --> 2909.6
so odd I can I'm very technically inept

2905.88 --> 2911.7200000000003
a chef in a what is it not enough this

2909.6 --> 2914.48
is capable

2911.72 --> 2916.75
but I don't draw anymore I just don't I

2914.48 --> 2920.329
only do it when it's necessary

2916.75 --> 2921.98
like when I need to show when I need

2920.329 --> 2923.3
visual assistance for something

2921.98 --> 2926.03
specifically and that's where a lot of

2923.3 --> 2929.0600000000004
the the drawings from Flat Earth came

2926.03 --> 2933.5
from and on the other hand also through

2929.06 --> 2936.0499999999997
the game D&D because I need to help them

2933.5 --> 2938.99
visualize it so then it's certainly

2936.05 --> 2942.53
there gets a direct function and I do it

2938.99 --> 2945.9199999999996
an intense no problem but the way that I

2942.53 --> 2948.5890000000004
used to just dribble around or try to

2945.92 --> 2953.06
like paint a dream or something no I

2948.589 --> 2955.94
never do that anymore and maybe it's for

2953.06 --> 2959.599
the better but it's very confusing to

2955.94 --> 2963.829
see how freaking confusing my life is

2959.599 --> 2966.8590000000004
really to me it's like it's going in all

2963.829 --> 2972.1400000000003
directions and I'm struggling to find

2966.859 --> 2975.2599999999998
some kind of viable logical path in in

2972.14 --> 2980.15
it all for my own personal choices it's

2975.26 --> 2982.4900000000002
very tough but it's not that apparent to

2980.15 --> 2987.5
the outside world until I break it to

2982.49 --> 2990.3799999999997
them in full because people that don't

2987.5 --> 2992.51
talk to me they just see this guy who

2990.38 --> 2997.79
always dressed the same always this kind

2992.51 --> 3001.63
of stoic very polite very warm we're in

2997.79 --> 3004.72
contact and pretty basic and sometimes

3001.63 --> 3005.9500000000003
talks of yeah if people do get in

3004.72 --> 3008.9199999999996
conversation then it's gonna be

3005.95 --> 3010.45
conspiracy always is a lot of talk a lot

3008.92 --> 3012.609
of subject for people to talk about and

3010.45 --> 3014.68
even people seem to step towards me

3012.609 --> 3016.5099999999998
thinking like yeah that guy's probably

3014.68 --> 3024.2999999999997
conspiracy theorists why else would he

3016.51 --> 3029.4700000000003
be like that and the right but on

3024.3 --> 3035.079
average people have no idea what my life

3029.47 --> 3036.8799999999997
is really like until I start to lay it

3035.079 --> 3039.6200000000003
out

3036.88 --> 3048.65
all the weirdness and all the weird

3039.62 --> 3051.1099999999997
mechanisms that I've dealt with anyway

3048.65 --> 3053.56
enough personal talk god I need to

3051.11 --> 3056.75
really talk about flatter sometimes

3053.56 --> 3058.67
although yeah you know the problem is

3056.75 --> 3060.86
with talking about Flat Earth now it

3058.67 --> 3062.81
really is becoming a problem for someone

3060.86 --> 3066.6800000000003
like me is I don't like repeating myself

3062.81 --> 3067.79
too often some people are a lot better

3066.68 --> 3071.7799999999997
in it Nathan

3067.79 --> 3075.23
very Nathan is very good he is at it

3071.78 --> 3077.69
it's a great teacher skill to just be

3075.23 --> 3080.15
able to just do the same thing over and

3077.69 --> 3082.04
over and over again a little artistic

3080.15 --> 3084.05
twist maybe a little joke here and there

3082.04 --> 3085.82
sometimes really sure but always do the

3084.05 --> 3089.63
same thing over and over I'm not so

3085.82 --> 3092.96
really I'm not really great at it doing

3089.63 --> 3094.73
that so and the problem is then what

3092.96 --> 3096.23
happens well if you're gonna talk about

3094.73 --> 3098.57
Flat Earth it's mostly gonna be

3096.23 --> 3101.18
answering questions when somebody has a

3098.57 --> 3102.77
question about it or responding to the

3101.18 --> 3104.6299999999997
damn ballerz again but then it's not

3102.77 --> 3106.63
gonna be about Flat Earth it's just

3104.63 --> 3111.4700000000003
gonna be about the freaking psychology

3106.63 --> 3113.51
so it's it's pretty tough these days for

3111.47 --> 3119.5299999999997
me to talk about Flat Earth for a

3113.51 --> 3122.9900000000002
prolonged period because well I'm not

3119.53 --> 3125.5400000000004
really a like a detailed researcher in

3122.99 --> 3127.6699999999996
the sense that I'd go and like perfectly

3125.54 --> 3130.7
figure out optics and like get all the

3127.67 --> 3133.9900000000002
the science and the research like for

3130.7 --> 3137.6299999999997
example right no not really

3133.99 --> 3139.7599999999998
life is short he's absolute specialist

3137.63 --> 3141.23
at it and that's great but I don't do

3139.76 --> 3144.19
that I mean I mean Maura I'm a

3141.23 --> 3147.53
generalist and a conceptualize er and

3144.19 --> 3150.11
feel a bit like an arbiter I hope people

3147.53 --> 3151.6400000000003
see me as that a bit it's like what

3150.11 --> 3154.4
would our win think of it because I do

3151.64 --> 3156.68
my best really to get things right and

3154.4 --> 3160.7000000000003
not to let it reflect up on something

3156.68 --> 3162.8999999999996
personal about a personal I really tried

3160.7 --> 3167.99
to do my best

3162.9 --> 3167.9900000000002
to judge properly as it were generally

3169.31 --> 3172.429
[Music]

3175.85 --> 3186.9
philosopher add stuff I guess I am

3181.91 --> 3190.37
technically if you look at the word it's

3186.9 --> 3194.52
a reason about life pretty much

3190.37 --> 3196.38
philosophy yeah well I do talk a lot

3194.52 --> 3198.96
about myself a talk a lot about my

3196.38 --> 3202.17
psychology about finding my way so it

3198.96 --> 3205.88
added in a way although philosophy in

3202.17 --> 3209.84
general seems to be more extracted into

3205.88 --> 3213.4500000000003
mechanical things

3209.84 --> 3216.1400000000003
so in general philosophy doesn't really

3213.45 --> 3219.7799999999997
appeal to me that much what is out there

3216.14 --> 3221.8199999999997
but as a technical process yeah

3219.78 --> 3226.01
philosophy I've always been doing that

3221.82 --> 3229.2000000000003
since I was a very very young kid like

3226.01 --> 3231.38
six and seven I started that's like the

3229.2 --> 3234.5099999999998
first thing I wanted to talk about and

3231.38 --> 3237.12
like what is God is he really there and

3234.51 --> 3239.01
why do I feel it's something there why

3237.12 --> 3241.5299999999997
do these things work the way they do

3239.01 --> 3243.57
this like I really started to ask these

3241.53 --> 3246.8100000000004
technical questions that an incredibly

3243.57 --> 3249.3900000000003
young age and very seriously and my

3246.81 --> 3251.2799999999997
parents got it they saw that it was very

3249.39 --> 3255.69
serious I'm so glad that they did take

3251.28 --> 3257.94
me seriously but they didn't have all

3255.69 --> 3261.96
the answers either and I understood that

3257.94 --> 3266.75
very early on to me when it was pretty

3261.96 --> 3270.33
knit it almost felt like oh I have to be

3266.75 --> 3274.17
the while the wizard I would the one who

3270.33 --> 3276.81
knew the most of this family I would

3274.17 --> 3279.21
have to go and learn it all because they

3276.81 --> 3282.0299999999997
seem to not be able to handle certain

3279.21 --> 3285.48
things so I I had to do that that's what

3282.03 --> 3290.1800000000003
I thought as a very young kid no idea

3285.48 --> 3290.18
what I was getting into but yeah that's

3292.119 --> 3303.099
that's what it is that's where I am not

3299.63 --> 3303.099
quite as I thought it would be

3309.31 --> 3313.5099999999998
but it could be worse I guess anyway I

3311.47 --> 3317.25
think I'm gonna run out to show it's a

3313.51 --> 3317.25
almost an hour

3322.61 --> 3327.2000000000003
yeah philosophy will help bring about

3324.98 --> 3331.06
the globe liar that is it it is because

3327.2 --> 3331.06
of the psychology of mechanics and

3331.18 --> 3337.37
conceptualizations conceptualization is

3334.4 --> 3341.11
a big part of philosophy the problem is

3337.37 --> 3342.65
is that when you get used to certain

3341.11 --> 3344.06
presuppositions within those

3342.65 --> 3346.7000000000003
philosophies and there are quite a lot

3344.06 --> 3348.65
there's like branches of approaches and

3346.7 --> 3350.87
they're basically all presuppositions in

3348.65 --> 3356.56
a way when you get used to that then

3350.87 --> 3359.63
suddenly big presuppositions could

3356.56 --> 3362.75
you'll get used to it and you'll start

3359.63 --> 3365.09
to overlook it and this even happens

3362.75 --> 3368.9
among philosophers they get so set in

3365.09 --> 3371.54
their in their tracks in their way that

3368.9 --> 3374.78
they start to lose the ability to see it

3371.54 --> 3378.05
another way and I know this I know this

3374.78 --> 3380.0600000000004
from from my friend who knows a lot of

3378.05 --> 3382.07
philosophers by happenstance it's like

3380.06 --> 3384.47
the person I called yesterday from

3382.07 --> 3389.63
Rotterdam she the librarian

3384.47 --> 3393.1099999999997
it was in her 60s and she knows a lot

3389.63 --> 3396.59
yeah the trans boomer but she's awesome

3393.11 --> 3400.34
I really appreciate her really so much

3396.59 --> 3404.78
it's such a sport and a great good

3400.34 --> 3408.92
person but she knows a lot of

3404.78 --> 3414.05
philosophers and she confirms this it's

3408.92 --> 3417.32
like yeah great but every one of them

3414.05 --> 3419.8700000000003
basically struggles with not getting

3417.32 --> 3422.6600000000003
railroaded in a certain tendency it's a

3419.87 --> 3428.5899999999997
big struggle as a philosopher to provide

3422.66 --> 3428.5899999999997
that no it's not are you

3429.71 --> 3452.9900000000002
Oh your response into Winston Smith yeah

3441.58 --> 3453.95
right I thought so you're using the word

3452.99 --> 3457.0699999999997
philosophy

3453.95 --> 3460.5499999999997
well how about philosophy as the

3457.07 --> 3462.65
official designated philosophical

3460.55 --> 3466.3300000000004
studies and all the texts that come with

3462.65 --> 3470.48
and and the discipline how about that

3466.33 --> 3476.0
there's education for philosophy I have

3470.48 --> 3479.12
an ax was like two girls before my last

3476.0 --> 3482.69
ex who was studying philosophy she was

3479.12 --> 3485.5699999999997
very good at it and she was very annoyed

3482.69 --> 3486.68
by how everybody don't really doesn't

3485.57 --> 3489.2000000000003
know what the discipline of philosophy

3486.68 --> 3491.0
is about like nobody knows that

3489.2 --> 3493.73
everybody thinks they know falah

3491.0 --> 3497.66
philosophy the discipline they don't I

3493.73 --> 3501.35
don't I could I couldn't compete with

3497.66 --> 3503.5699999999997
that like true philosophy discipline as

3501.35 --> 3508.19
they get taught it's almost like

3503.57 --> 3512.51
politics yeah it's really structured

3508.19 --> 3515.66
really strict and you don't have a lot

3512.51 --> 3521.6200000000003
of maneuvering room mentally because

3515.66 --> 3521.62
there's all these rules and [ __ ] so

3521.65 --> 3528.26
there is of course colloquial philosophy

3525.07 --> 3532.2200000000003
just thinking about life figuring it out

3528.26 --> 3536.48
and there is the discipline of

3532.22 --> 3538.91
philosophy based on classical philosophy

3536.48 --> 3541.16
and thinking and that is its own

3538.91 --> 3542.8399999999997
discipline with the whole body of

3541.16 --> 3546.0499999999997
knowledge things that were thought out

3542.84 --> 3548.9
reason out Giants presuppositional

3546.05 --> 3551.15
structures within them and the

3548.9 --> 3553.2200000000003
discipline to deal with them but that's

3551.15 --> 3557.63
not the philosophy that the general

3553.22 --> 3559.3399999999997
public really knows a lot about and of

3557.63 --> 3562.3
course there are people that will read

3559.34 --> 3566.92
certain full of philosophers

3562.3 --> 3569.29
because well certain philosophers will

3566.92 --> 3572.6800000000003
have certain directions tendencies

3569.29 --> 3575.17
convictions that will appeal a lot to

3572.68 --> 3577.45
individuals that will be kind of in the

3575.17 --> 3580.1800000000003
same frequency going sort of in the same

3577.45 --> 3582.2799999999997
direction so yeah they'll love that that

3580.18 --> 3584.3399999999997
doesn't mean that they really understand

3582.28 --> 3587.52
the complete discipline of philosophy

3584.34 --> 3587.52
absolutely not

3589.8 --> 3595.42
right Winston Smith but you do agree

3592.96 --> 3597.01
that it is much more complicated than

3595.42 --> 3599.64
the general public believes it to be

3597.01 --> 3599.6400000000003
right

3610.97 --> 3615.47
indeed yeah and things like that what

3613.67 --> 3618.26
you said that sounds like typical

3615.47 --> 3621.3489999999997
philosophy you're using the word to

3618.26 --> 3624.5
define the word and that's probably

3621.349 --> 3626.54
technically incorrect right according to

3624.5 --> 3631.88
philosophy it's about there you go that

3626.54 --> 3635.69
see there's all these rules it's to be

3631.88 --> 3637.7000000000003
fair I think it's kind of lame it's not

3635.69 --> 3641.06
something that I like to do but I do

3637.7 --> 3645.23
respect people that can do that and it

3641.06 --> 3648.0789999999997
is what it is I I don't know what use it

3645.23 --> 3650.589
really is anymore in these days except

3648.079 --> 3652.55
for all the inspiration and

3650.589 --> 3655.7599999999998
understanding the roots of a lot of

3652.55 --> 3658.79
things and ways of thinking but yeah I

3655.76 --> 3661.099
wouldn't want to be like a technical

3658.79 --> 3668.24
philosopher and doing things with that

3661.099 --> 3670.069
but anyway I respect people that do my

3668.24 --> 3676.5789999999997
favorite philosophy class was logic yeah

3670.069 --> 3678.5299999999997
logic very important very very

3676.579 --> 3681.26
interesting there's a lot to say about

3678.53 --> 3682.9700000000003
it in philosophy as well it's

3681.26 --> 3685.5200000000004
fascinating because again there's so

3682.97 --> 3687.7099999999996
many angles to it that people don't even

3685.52 --> 3688.22
realize that you can think of it like

3687.71 --> 3690.589
that

3688.22 --> 3692.6299999999997
it's incredible anyway I'm gonna round

3690.589 --> 3695.599

3725.75 --> 3730.839
the Flat Earth debates that have just

3727.13 --> 3738.2200000000003
started up until the next video

3730.839 --> 3738.22
hashtag me fuh come on and keep it flat
