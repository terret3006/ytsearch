181.2 --> 187.11999999999998
okay we're picking mushrooms got it

184.08 --> 187.12
gadget inspector

190.64 --> 196.07999999999998
oh you were with some others because you

192.239 --> 196.08
didn't know which ones to pick yeah

196.48 --> 201.04
right yeah it's important to know which

198.72 --> 201.04
ones

206.48 --> 209.28
i remember like

211.44 --> 216.879
going along like looking for mushrooms

213.68 --> 216.87900000000002
as a little kid even

217.44 --> 220.4
but with other people my parent my

219.36 --> 222.31900000000002
mother

220.4 --> 224.56
didn't really do that too i think a

222.319 --> 226.56
couple of times

224.56 --> 228.799
but yeah there were like

226.56 --> 230.319
other people we knew that did that all

228.799 --> 232.48000000000002
the time

230.319 --> 233.51899999999998
because they were like living very near

232.48 --> 235.11999999999998
forest

233.519 --> 236.64000000000001
and all that

235.12 --> 241.31900000000002
but uh

236.64 --> 241.319
no i know nothing magic was mushrooms

250.4 --> 253.04
right

251.599 --> 255.11999999999998
it's a bit odd

253.04 --> 257.36
time for the year to pick mushrooms

255.12 --> 257.36
though

259.199 --> 264.68
or maybe it's because you had a lot of

261.04 --> 264.68
wet weather recently

271.52 --> 274.65
right

273.04 --> 277.71000000000004
yeah it's it's the moist

274.65 --> 277.71
[Music]

277.84 --> 281.44
i mean

278.72 --> 283.44000000000005
mushrooms do kind of thrive with

281.44 --> 285.919
with heat

283.44 --> 288.08
as long as there's not just too much sun

285.919 --> 291.28
and enough moist right

288.08 --> 291.28
that's what they like the most

291.919 --> 294.15999999999997
yeah

294.72 --> 300.24
rain after heat but right it has to be

296.8 --> 300.24
the right conditions for it though

302.16 --> 306.32000000000005
i mean if it's just a storm a lot of

304.4 --> 308.0
rain and then immediately it gets

306.32 --> 309.12
blazing hot again

308.0 --> 312.639
it's very

309.12 --> 312.639
it's less likely i think

319.039 --> 325.84
hey pjc net good to see you

322.56 --> 325.84
all right interesting

327.52 --> 333.44
good to to see that you're learning yeah

330.16 --> 335.91900000000004
that you're engaging in learning some

333.44 --> 338.16
food natural food gathering skills

335.919 --> 341.44
gadget inspector

338.16 --> 341.44
it's a good skill to learn

344.0 --> 349.36
right once you got it it's it's very

346.479 --> 350.639
easy to pass on to if anybody else wants

349.36 --> 352.47900000000004
to know

350.639 --> 354.16
right you don't need to know all the

352.479 --> 357.68
mushrooms in the world you just need to

354.16 --> 357.68
know the ones in the region

359.52 --> 364.79999999999995
got a big basket oh cool

361.919 --> 367.35999999999996
what are you gonna make with them

364.8 --> 368.72
what types are they

367.36 --> 371.68
by the way

368.72 --> 371.68
if do you know

373.759 --> 380.509
they can look them up in a mushroom book

377.47 --> 380.509
[Music]

398.08 --> 402.19899999999996
hey metal slugs coca-cola

410.08 --> 413.039
puffballs right

413.759 --> 420.16
yeah exactly

416.4 --> 422.63899999999995
like in my grandmother's old farm

420.16 --> 425.36
to the north in the netherlands we had

422.639 --> 427.84000000000003
those big puffball mushrooms everywhere

425.36 --> 430.16
every year

427.84 --> 432.479
and sometimes they would like cook them

430.16 --> 435.28000000000003
too but i did not like them at all i've

432.479 --> 437.84
never been a big fan of mushrooms

435.28 --> 437.84
to be fair

438.88 --> 442.4
like

439.919 --> 444.56
i eat some mushrooms because i just know

442.4 --> 446.63
they're like really healthy and all that

444.56 --> 448.84
like shiitake

446.63 --> 450.8
[Music]

448.84 --> 452.23999999999995
and

450.8 --> 455.12
ricey

452.24 --> 457.52
like i might eat them specifically

455.12 --> 460.88
because i know they're so healthy but

457.52 --> 465.19899999999996
i don't like mushrooms i don't like the

460.88 --> 467.36
it's yeah you call that

465.199 --> 469.36
ah

467.36 --> 471.68
i don't like how they feel in between my

469.36 --> 471.68
teeth

473.199 --> 479.84000000000003
what's the word for that i don't know

476.72 --> 479.84000000000003
the substance

480.639 --> 485.599
yeah in the dutch it's substance

484.319 --> 487.28000000000003
anyway

485.599 --> 489.039
i'm not a big fan of mushrooms but i

487.28 --> 492.67999999999995
know that they are

489.039 --> 492.68
very good food

493.28 --> 497.919
especially if you have a good metabolism

495.52 --> 497.919
for them

500.96 --> 505.52
giant puffball no they are not poisonous

503.68 --> 507.68
but you gotta be quick because as soon

505.52 --> 510.08
as they basically start

507.68 --> 512.24
well ripening then it just turns into

510.08 --> 515.68
this giant puffball with all these

512.24 --> 515.6800000000001
spores that's gross

518.64 --> 523.68
like as kids

520.719 --> 526.24
me and my half brother and my

523.68 --> 528.3199999999999
my nephews we used to like even get all

526.24 --> 530.0
silly and just play football with the

528.32 --> 531.6
puffballs

530.0 --> 534.839
pretty gross

531.6 --> 534.839
but hilarious

534.959 --> 541.04
but only like if not with the fresh ones

538.48 --> 544.24
right only if they got puffy that we'd

541.04 --> 546.64
start to play football with them

544.24 --> 550.5600000000001
in retrospect it's not surprising that

546.64 --> 554.64
there were puffball mushrooms everywhere

550.56 --> 554.64
because we played football with that

557.04 --> 563.399
hilarious

559.519 --> 563.399
i miss those old days

564.0 --> 566.64
texture

568.24 --> 574.519
right kevlar hello by the way

570.959 --> 574.5189999999999
yeah that's the one

579.36 --> 583.92
or at least it is another form to

581.76 --> 584.8
describe it texture it's yeah good

583.92 --> 586.56
enough

584.8 --> 588.959
uh

586.56 --> 593.5999999999999
but yeah i don't like mushrooms

588.959 --> 593.5999999999999
i like i might eat like what is it

594.48 --> 609.48
that's typical mushrooms

598.18 --> 609.4799999999999
[Music]

612.54 --> 622.079
[Music]

618.88 --> 624.64
okay it's called the champion mushroom

622.079 --> 624.64
apparently

624.88 --> 630.0
right in english as well

627.04 --> 632.16
well yeah if they're all grounded up

630.0 --> 634.64
like really grounded up so that there's

632.16 --> 638.8
nothing left of the texture

634.64 --> 638.8
then i don't mind every now and then

643.279 --> 646.279
right

646.45 --> 651.399
[Music]

665.519 --> 670.24
okay i don't get it guys inspector

668.32 --> 672.48
must be your french humor shining

670.24 --> 672.48
through

672.959 --> 676.88
i mean french

674.48 --> 678.5600000000001
really laugh very easily towards any

676.88 --> 679.519
kind of stupid joke

678.56 --> 681.5189999999999
so

679.519 --> 683.76
yeah i called it right you might be born

681.519 --> 685.92
irish but you're definitely like french

683.76 --> 689.3199999999999
assimilated

685.92 --> 689.3199999999999
i can tell

689.76 --> 692.0
uh

697.76 --> 702.079
by the way i'm just messing with you

699.12 --> 704.24
guys inspector

702.079 --> 705.519
uh

704.24 --> 708.5600000000001
sort of

705.519 --> 710.72
i every time i make a joke it's always

708.56 --> 713.7199999999999
not a joke as well it's just how i do

710.72 --> 713.72
things

719.92 --> 723.5999999999999
yeah i get it pgc net yeah if you

722.079 --> 725.12
collect it themselves and they're like

723.6 --> 728.639
really fresh

725.12 --> 732.48
i mean the best way is to like

728.639 --> 734.32
pick them in in an early foggy morning

732.48 --> 738.0
and then as soon as you get home like

734.32 --> 741.519
immediately start processing them right

738.0 --> 741.519
like as fresh as possible

743.68 --> 749.12
those are that that's the best

746.8 --> 751.92
by the way in general that's the best

749.12 --> 753.839
even with like regular vegetables

751.92 --> 756.24
but with mushrooms

753.839 --> 759.6800000000001
yeah don't like let them hang around

756.24 --> 760.639
like use them as quick as possible

759.68 --> 762.6389999999999
or

760.639 --> 764.32
freeze dry them you could do that

762.639 --> 768.6800000000001
perhaps

764.32 --> 768.6800000000001
that does seem to work as well

772.72 --> 777.279
but i don't know

774.399 --> 777.279
ask an expert

779.68 --> 783.68
i've just seen people freeze dry

781.44 --> 786.9590000000001
mushrooms

783.68 --> 791.079
like put them all dried up in pots

786.959 --> 791.079
and that seems to work great

800.16 --> 804.88
yes kevlar you don't have to explain

802.32 --> 804.88
that joke

813.12 --> 819.839
i mean look guys inspector i'm sure

816.959 --> 822.0
that if 10th man was here he would let

819.839 --> 825.0
get a chuckle out of it

822.0 --> 825.0
right

840.32 --> 845.6800000000001
absorb the flavor yeah

843.12 --> 845.68
that's right

847.04 --> 851.76
right so make sure that if you're gonna

849.199 --> 853.4399999999999
like cook them or bake them or whatever

851.76 --> 857.8389999999999
do it in

853.44 --> 857.839
the thing you want them to taste like

858.0 --> 863.04
like don't cook them just in water and

860.72 --> 865.1990000000001
then add stuff later it's better to just

863.04 --> 867.76
like get it all drenched in there

865.199 --> 867.76
immediately

868.24 --> 871.839
i don't know can you

869.68 --> 873.5999999999999
could you like marinate

871.839 --> 876.24
mushrooms i've never even thought of

873.6 --> 878.0790000000001
that before i haven't seen that maybe

876.24 --> 880.16
that could work too

878.079 --> 882.16
it just like you marinate meat you just

880.16 --> 884.56
have like stuff i don't know what it

882.16 --> 888.0
would be

884.56 --> 889.4399999999999
like some sauce and onion and stuff and

888.0 --> 891.519
just like

889.44 --> 893.6800000000001
chop it up and just put it in there just

891.519 --> 896.079
leave it in there i know maybe that

893.68 --> 898.4799999999999
could work great too i've never

896.079 --> 902.88
tried that not as i said i'm not a big

898.48 --> 904.16
mushroom fan but i can definitely

902.88 --> 907.04
imagine

904.16 --> 909.199
i i like do respect that it is like an

907.04 --> 911.519
important food

909.199 --> 914.959
a much overlooked food i just don't

911.519 --> 914.9590000000001
personally like it all that much

917.279 --> 923.04
nature's tofu yeah

920.32 --> 927.6
yeah i would not eat tofu i like if i'd

923.04 --> 929.12
have to choose between soy and tofu

927.6 --> 931.0400000000001
or mushrooms

929.12 --> 932.079
that were like good

931.04 --> 934.16
fresh

932.079 --> 937.3199999999999
nature pig mushrooms i'd probably choose

934.16 --> 937.3199999999999
the mushrooms

938.68 --> 941.89
[Music]

[Music]

problem is it it does cost

1033.039 --> 1036.8799999999999
like

1034.88 --> 1038.64
well they're not as cheap as they should

1036.88 --> 1040.72
be

1038.64 --> 1043.199
because it's not like a special quality

1040.72 --> 1047.039
or anything

1043.199 --> 1049.8400000000001
but yeah i do kind of want to

1047.039 --> 1052.48
another white shirt like a lot of

1049.84 --> 1055.76
i have some others it's just that they

1052.48 --> 1058.24
like they got a lot of holes

1055.76 --> 1061.72
i don't know why

1058.24 --> 1061.72
they just do

1068.08 --> 1073.6789999999999
all right you can always donate extra to

1070.559 --> 1076.32
my paypal specifically with the remark

1073.679 --> 1076.3200000000002
like buy

1076.72 --> 1080.919
a new white shirt or something

1081.039 --> 1085.84
i know white shirts go yeah i'm not i'm

1084.16 --> 1088.72
not

1085.84 --> 1089.6789999999999
afraid of having like a

1088.72 --> 1092.48
cram

1089.679 --> 1093.6000000000001
cream colored shirt eventually that i

1092.48 --> 1095.52
know

1093.6 --> 1097.4399999999998
right as long as the discoloration is

1095.52 --> 1099.36
like not too

1097.44 --> 1102.0
in your face

1099.36 --> 1103.52
it's just uniformly

1102.0 --> 1105.44
getting less white i don't have a

1103.52 --> 1107.9189999999999
problem i mean i have

1105.44 --> 1110.3200000000002
these weird short pants that used to be

1107.919 --> 1112.7990000000002
black they're more brown now so i'm like

1110.32 --> 1116.0
okay i'll just go all terracotta and

1112.799 --> 1116.0
[ __ ] whatever man

1118.24 --> 1124.72
you only have five one okay

1122.0 --> 1124.72
right accepted

1134.88 --> 1137.8400000000001
hmm

1149.6 --> 1155.52
whoa weird at you all

1153.679 --> 1157.76
there's some really freaky looking

1155.52 --> 1160.16
mushrooms

1157.76 --> 1162.32
and i look i don't

1160.16 --> 1164.559
but it's like when i see a mushroom i

1162.32 --> 1166.3999999999999
don't get like

1164.559 --> 1168.24
oh yes

1166.4 --> 1170.16
i don't have that

1168.24 --> 1173.44
i'm rather like okay

1170.16 --> 1175.76
that could be nutritious it's just not

1173.44 --> 1177.52
very appealing to me like oh yeah i want

1175.76 --> 1179.84
to eat that oh

1177.52 --> 1179.84
no

1180.16 --> 1187.3600000000001
but again i do respect it

1184.4 --> 1189.52
and i temp typically do appreciate it

1187.36 --> 1191.1999999999998
when other people like really know their

1189.52 --> 1195.6
mushrooms

1191.2 --> 1198.16
because then it's like safe to eat some

1195.6 --> 1200.9599999999998
mushrooms that i probably never eat

1198.16 --> 1200.96
with those people

1202.4 --> 1207.4
again

1203.4 --> 1207.4
non-psychotropic ones

1212.0 --> 1215.039
but i've seen some really weird [ __ ] out

1214.24 --> 1217.44
there

1215.039 --> 1219.6
one time

1217.44 --> 1222.64
i don't i might have made a photograph

1219.6 --> 1224.799
of it but probably not but one time

1222.64 --> 1227.2
we were like me and my ex were walking

1224.799 --> 1229.36
in a forest in this southeast of the

1227.2 --> 1230.72
country here

1229.36 --> 1232.799
there's a lot of beautiful forest

1230.72 --> 1236.159
there's one of the reasons we wanted to

1232.799 --> 1239.6
go there it's really beautiful

1236.159 --> 1239.6000000000001
but there was like this

1239.84 --> 1245.36
gelatinous ooze

1242.48 --> 1248.64
like a yellow blob this bit like a a

1245.36 --> 1250.799
small tennis ball it was like super

1248.64 --> 1253.5200000000002
bright orange

1250.799 --> 1257.44
transparent it literally looked like a

1253.52 --> 1257.7
giant piece of industrial candy

1257.44 --> 1259.1200000000001
like

1257.7 --> 1261.52
[Music]

1259.12 --> 1263.039
like just a blob was just sitting

1261.52 --> 1265.679
somewhere

1263.039 --> 1267.76
like what the [ __ ] is that it was like

1265.679 --> 1270.0800000000002
so creepy

1267.76 --> 1271.6
that it like it looked like if you don't

1270.08 --> 1273.36
if you just

1271.6 --> 1277.84
look away for a minute it's just gonna

1273.36 --> 1277.84
crawl closer towards you or something

1278.4 --> 1282.01
which is butter

1280.08 --> 1285.21
yuck

1282.01 --> 1285.21
[Music]

1285.44 --> 1289.3600000000001
but that was freaky

1287.28 --> 1292.6399999999999
because it was just like perfectly

1289.36 --> 1292.6399999999999
transparent all of it

1302.96 --> 1307.039
okay

1305.28 --> 1311.0
somebody found another piece of

1307.039 --> 1311.0
fireworks in their basement

1320.64 --> 1323.64
[ __ ]

1333.44 --> 1338.159
every time now somebody likes fireworks

1336.08 --> 1339.1999999999998
i'm always thinking like

1338.159 --> 1341.6000000000001
you're

1339.2 --> 1345.48
unwittingly like

1341.6 --> 1345.48
influencing the weather

1346.64 --> 1348.88
uh

1350.4 --> 1354.3200000000002
whatever

1352.24 --> 1357.44
probably somebody that like

1354.32 --> 1357.4399999999998
graduated or

1358.799 --> 1361.799
something

1364.64 --> 1367.5200000000002
all right

1365.84 --> 1369.1999999999998
lisa they're not doing it all the time

1367.52 --> 1371.36
now right

1369.2 --> 1372.159
anyhow

1371.36 --> 1373.12
yeah

1372.159 --> 1376.48
slime

1373.12 --> 1376.4799999999998
which is butter it's called

1381.679 --> 1384.96
no it's not popcorn it's

1386.84 --> 1393.6789999999999
fireworks go shake my fist at them i

1390.0 --> 1393.679
couldn't even see it

1396.08 --> 1400.84
oh by the way seeking star wars i sent

1398.4 --> 1404.96
you an email

1400.84 --> 1404.9599999999998
yesterday did you check it

1411.36 --> 1416.08
because i got a special surprise

1413.9 --> 1418.64
[Music]

1416.08 --> 1420.96
get off my lawn it's not my lawn though

1418.64 --> 1424.88
gorzilla

1420.96 --> 1424.88
i don't have lawn unfortunately

1428.4 --> 1433.44
ah metal slugs cockatoo i didn't need to

1430.88 --> 1435.919
know that

1433.44 --> 1435.919
thanks

1436.159 --> 1442.48
so my freaking intuition was right that

1439.679 --> 1444.5590000000002
is so messed up i could just feel that

1442.48 --> 1446.88
it would be moving

1444.559 --> 1446.8799999999999
ah

1456.72 --> 1460.0
right yes

1457.76 --> 1462.0
make sure to check the second chart

1460.0 --> 1464.64
because i sent you one first and then

1462.0 --> 1468.08
pretty quickly after sent you a

1464.64 --> 1468.0800000000002
seriously updated version

1469.76 --> 1472.76
so

1475.12 --> 1479.12
and there is a lot of room for

1476.799 --> 1480.72
improvement still

1479.12 --> 1482.1589999999999
although i haven't really gotten that

1480.72 --> 1484.08
much feedback

1482.159 --> 1486.5590000000002
from the guys nathan seemed to like it a

1484.08 --> 1489.52
lot i did during the fed after show

1486.559 --> 1493.12
yesterday which was a great show even

1489.52 --> 1493.12
had a kumu virus on for a bit

1493.76 --> 1497.2
and everybody was in good form like

1495.76 --> 1498.24
everybody

1497.2 --> 1500.96
uh

1498.24 --> 1503.36
very little rumpusing

1500.96 --> 1505.679
relatively

1503.36 --> 1507.52
but uh

1505.679 --> 1510.24
that's it

1507.52 --> 1512.08
yeah during the after show i yeah i was

1510.24 --> 1513.2
thinking like okay i'm just gonna do it

1512.08 --> 1517.52
now

1513.2 --> 1517.52
so i made the derpcon chart

1517.76 --> 1525.39
and it's not even a half a year later

1522.26 --> 1525.39
[Music]

1548.0 --> 1551.6
it moves really slow

1553.36 --> 1557.08
but how slow

1559.12 --> 1564.8799999999999
like what's it's what is it it's typical

1562.0 --> 1564.88
moving speed

1565.2 --> 1569.279
i mean if you were like chained up in a

1567.84 --> 1572.1589999999999
dungeon

1569.279 --> 1574.64
would they eventually just like crawl

1572.159 --> 1574.64
over you

1576.4 --> 1581.72
like would they even be attracted to

1578.0 --> 1581.72
humans i don't know

1589.919 --> 1596.0800000000002
what courses

1592.72 --> 1596.08
neptunian slug

1596.48 --> 1600.799
well there's a whole creature category

1599.76 --> 1602.96
for it

1600.799 --> 1604.96
in dungeons and dragons

1602.96 --> 1609.279
oozes

1604.96 --> 1611.44
although oozes do move a lot faster

1609.279 --> 1615.44
than these things probably

1611.44 --> 1615.44
but they still move slow in the game

1616.4 --> 1623.72
from futurama um

1618.88 --> 1623.72
right yeah that's been a while

1634.4 --> 1639.1200000000001
all right i remember that slugs that

1636.559 --> 1643.24
like got on your head and then they took

1639.12 --> 1643.2399999999998
your mind over

1656.63 --> 1659.8190000000002
[Music]

1673.6 --> 1677.4399999999998
hmm

1675.44 --> 1678.72
by the way i'm looking up the witch's

1677.44 --> 1683.52
butter

1678.72 --> 1685.76
it doesn't exactly look like what i saw

1683.52 --> 1687.039
this is a more like fragmented weird

1685.76 --> 1688.799
that's like the

1687.039 --> 1691.76
it is a yellow one but it is not

1688.799 --> 1693.44
transparent now the one i saw was like a

1691.76 --> 1695.84
uniform

1693.44 --> 1697.039
like a sphere it was really like one big

1695.84 --> 1699.52
blob not

1697.039 --> 1702.08
a bunch of like flakes

1699.52 --> 1702.08
like these

1709.6 --> 1714.399
and it was like so transparent that it

1712.159 --> 1717.6000000000001
was actually having a lens effect you

1714.399 --> 1717.6
could see through it

1720.64 --> 1724.3200000000002
so it's different

1722.0 --> 1727.57
just

1724.32 --> 1727.57
[Music]

1728.08 --> 1734.08
which is cauldron whoa

1731.52 --> 1735.84
what the [ __ ] is that

1734.08 --> 1737.84
that looks freaky

1735.84 --> 1740.399
and it does look like a cauldron that is

1737.84 --> 1740.399
so weird

1745.58 --> 1751.72
[Music]

1748.72 --> 1751.72
ew

1759.15 --> 1763.0690000000002
[Music]

1771.84 --> 1774.8799999999999
trying to find it

1775.52 --> 1780.36
man there's such weird mushrooms out

1777.36 --> 1780.36
there

1783.2 --> 1787.2
it was just a perfect

1785.279 --> 1789.84
transparent

1787.2 --> 1792.72
yellow blob

1789.84 --> 1797.799
a bright orange yellowish

1792.72 --> 1797.799
very bright like almost neon colored

1841.84 --> 1847.0
just trying to lick

1844.0 --> 1847.0
see

1855.039 --> 1859.679
just googling yellow mushroom and maybe

1858.08 --> 1864.6789999999999
i'll bump into it but it seems like

1859.679 --> 1864.679
these are toadstool mushrooms so

1865.7 --> 1868.779
[Music]

1871.63 --> 1876.65
[Music]

1876.84 --> 1882.48
um well

1879.12 --> 1885.5189999999998
i'm thinking maybe it was what you said

1882.48 --> 1885.519
seeking star wars the

1886.88 --> 1891.519
witch's butter but maybe it was just an

1889.519 --> 1892.64
aberration

1891.519 --> 1896.24
that it just

1892.64 --> 1900.69
turned into a full on blob but

1896.24 --> 1903.999
no it didn't exactly look like that

1900.69 --> 1903.999
[Music]

1907.52 --> 1910.7
[Music]

1917.679 --> 1923.8400000000001
but yeah so far

1921.279 --> 1926.0
which is butter is the closest to what

1923.84 --> 1930.1589999999999
it looks like what it looked like

1926.0 --> 1930.159
because it is kind of transparent

1930.88 --> 1933.88
um

1942.48 --> 1945.48
well

1949.519 --> 1954.72
man just

1950.96 --> 1957.679
looking at mushrooms is almost trippy

1954.72 --> 1960.24
like let alone eating them just

1957.679 --> 1962.5590000000002
browsing through pictures of mushroom is

1960.24 --> 1964.88
just trippy

1962.559 --> 1964.8799999999999
hey

1965.2 --> 1968.24
hey this

1969.76 --> 1975.0
what

1971.6 --> 1975.0
getting closer

1976.88 --> 1981.6000000000001
so i found one that almost kind of looks

1979.36 --> 1985.799
like what i saw

1981.6 --> 1985.799
i need something closer

2006.799 --> 2009.519
hmm

2007.13 --> 2011.679
[Music]

2009.519 --> 2011.679
no

2015.679 --> 2018.5590000000002
slime

2016.84 --> 2020.9199999999998
mold

2018.559 --> 2024.509
okay i'll try it

2020.92 --> 2024.509
[Music]

2029.76 --> 2034.1589999999999
if it was a slime mode then it was huge

2034.24 --> 2036.72
because

2034.96 --> 2039.44
these slime molds all

2036.72 --> 2043.24
what i'm looking at it so like

2039.44 --> 2043.24
looks more like coral

2052.0 --> 2057.76
this thing was literally just only

2055.04 --> 2061.2
like this orange yellow transparent

2057.76 --> 2064.079
almost sphere like thing there was no

2061.2 --> 2065.7599999999998
branching or roots that i could see

2064.079 --> 2070.9190000000003
surrounding it

2065.76 --> 2070.9190000000003
so it just looked like a gelatinous ooze

2082.72 --> 2087.04
i'm thinking now maybe i did actually

2085.2 --> 2089.359
take a picture of it

2087.04 --> 2091.52
but that's going to take me like half an

2089.359 --> 2093.44
hour digging through photos to see if i

2091.52 --> 2095.52
can find it

2093.44 --> 2096.48
i'm not going to do that right now

2095.52 --> 2099.119
anyway

2096.48 --> 2101.76
mushrooms

2099.119 --> 2101.76
there's a lot

2102.8 --> 2105.92
anyway

2103.92 --> 2108.4
what are you guys talking about did you

2105.92 --> 2110.4
take a look at the derp alert or the

2108.4 --> 2112.56
derpcon chart

2110.4 --> 2115.04
any feedback would be great

2112.56 --> 2115.04
also

2115.52 --> 2120.96
was a great

2118.72 --> 2123.7599999999998
great video

2120.96 --> 2126.64
from space busters again

2123.76 --> 2129.119
about germ theory and virology

2126.64 --> 2130.8799999999997
it's the most detailed presentation i've

2129.119 --> 2133.2000000000003
seen today

2130.88 --> 2135.52
and that guy's been like really on top

2133.2 --> 2135.52
of it

2136.079 --> 2141.92
like his research his meticulous level

2139.28 --> 2143.599
of research and dedication like to what

2141.92 --> 2146.56
he knows is the truth

2143.599 --> 2148.88
is staggering makes me feel ashamed but

2146.56 --> 2151.359
he probably is like a doctor and you

2148.88 --> 2151.359
know he

2151.52 --> 2154.32
it's like a real

2155.599 --> 2159.04
really focused on all that and he knows

2157.68 --> 2160.7999999999997
many people

2159.04 --> 2163.04
concerning that

2160.8 --> 2163.04
so

2163.119 --> 2165.359
great

2164.24 --> 2168.9199999999996
video

2165.359 --> 2168.92
check it out

2177.68 --> 2182.72
stupid name [ __ ] no it's it's in there

2181.119 --> 2183.92
but

2182.72 --> 2187.839
yeah

2183.92 --> 2187.839
perhaps seeking star wars

2191.28 --> 2195.0400000000004
that's not

2192.72 --> 2195.04
one

2198.4 --> 2202.56
like because if it's like

2200.48 --> 2204.4
a stupid name right

2202.56 --> 2207.04
well why is it a stupid name it's

2204.4 --> 2210.1600000000003
usually a stupid name to

2207.04 --> 2211.839
to manipulate us right so just a stupid

2210.16 --> 2214.48
there's plenty of people that just have

2211.839 --> 2217.2799999999997
kind of a stupid random name right

2214.48 --> 2219.359
or like oh i'm named after some manga

2217.28 --> 2222.6400000000003
figure or whatever

2219.359 --> 2224.24
that doesn't really matter at all

2222.64 --> 2227.359
right but if they're like

2224.24 --> 2229.2
on purpose stupid in a specific way to

2227.359 --> 2231.52
manipulate you

2229.2 --> 2234.7999999999997
you can feel that

2231.52 --> 2237.04
then it's more than derpcon one

2234.8 --> 2237.04
right

2237.2 --> 2241.2
like that's already kind of derpcon 3

2239.76 --> 2243.5200000000004
actually

2241.2 --> 2245.68
so there is a pretty sophisticated

2243.52 --> 2248.8
balance to the derpcon chat by the way

2245.68 --> 2250.3999999999996
guys i'm going to show you that

2248.8 --> 2253.04
but uh

2250.4 --> 2254.079
guys again i posted the link to this

2253.04 --> 2256.48
video

2254.079 --> 2259.599
check it out like i

2256.48 --> 2262.4
pretty much am fully behind

2259.599 --> 2263.6800000000003
almost everything or or everything that

2262.4 --> 2265.2000000000003
he said

2263.68 --> 2266.5699999999997
and like

2265.2 --> 2267.7599999999998
i feel like

2266.57 --> 2270.7200000000003
[Music]

2267.76 --> 2273.76
i'm now following in his his tracks

2270.72 --> 2277.839
because he's done very deep research

2273.76 --> 2277.8390000000004
and he's confirmed more things

2281.839 --> 2287.359
about what i yeah what i've been

2283.92 --> 2289.52
thinking about the medical

2287.359 --> 2293.68
establishment

2289.52 --> 2297.119
now germ therian virology is a giant rod

2293.68 --> 2300.3999999999996
like a giant inward mind control fraud

2297.119 --> 2302.4
it's it is really insane

2300.4 --> 2305.92
but yeah this guy

2302.4 --> 2307.119
spacebusters really backs it with a lot

2305.92 --> 2309.76
of

2307.119 --> 2311.76
evidence and reference in like

2309.76 --> 2314.1600000000003
news articles that he scanned in and

2311.76 --> 2316.079
there's so much evidence so much

2314.16 --> 2319.52
testimony

2316.079 --> 2322.2400000000002
and and direct links like look here look

2319.52 --> 2325.2
there right i talk about [ __ ] and then

2322.24 --> 2326.7999999999997
i'm on camera this guy like shows

2325.2 --> 2329.2799999999997
everything

2326.8 --> 2331.92
so he he does a little speech and then

2329.28 --> 2335.44
probably works hours and hours and hours

2331.92 --> 2335.44
of just getting all the right

2335.76 --> 2341.8390000000004
pieces of text

2337.599 --> 2342.8
and references all in the video

2341.839 --> 2345.52
it is

2342.8 --> 2347.6800000000003
like a yeah

2345.52 --> 2350.72
enormous job that he did on this video

2347.68 --> 2352.48
and it is extremely informative and

2350.72 --> 2354.8799999999997
i'm glad to say that pretty much the

2352.48 --> 2357.119
direction i've been taking

2354.88 --> 2359.2000000000003
seems to be perfectly backed

2357.119 --> 2361.76
by his approach and

2359.2 --> 2363.1189999999997
with evidence like with all the evidence

2361.76 --> 2364.48
basically all the things that i've been

2363.119 --> 2366.079
saying

2364.48 --> 2368.4
he's even

2366.079 --> 2370.88
gone into more detail

2368.4 --> 2373.2000000000003
fantastic it is fantastic it is

2370.88 --> 2375.52
mind-boggling because

2373.2 --> 2378.0789999999997
it does he does reveal like this is like

2375.52 --> 2380.16
a puzzle in a puzzle in a puzzle

2378.079 --> 2383.6400000000003
and they're all lost it's like this

2380.16 --> 2383.64
giant maze

2384.32 --> 2388.88
and none of them

2386.32 --> 2390.8
probably realize or barely realize or

2388.88 --> 2391.92
they don't want to realize that it's all

2390.8 --> 2397.079
just

2391.92 --> 2397.079
complete nonsense and fraud

2400.4 --> 2404.88
space bus to american gay oh great

2403.28 --> 2407.92
well i didn't need to know about that

2404.88 --> 2410.7200000000003
thanks they weren't talking about that

2407.92 --> 2412.96
so

2410.72 --> 2412.9599999999996
right

2416.88 --> 2422.319
fine whatever

2419.04 --> 2424.88
like i don't need to know about that

2422.319 --> 2427.599
yeah

2424.88 --> 2431.28
i mean somebody's to me really is only

2427.599 --> 2433.119
gay when they're openly gay

2431.28 --> 2435.92
if they're not and i don't know about it

2433.119 --> 2437.76
then i don't give a [ __ ] just make sure

2435.92 --> 2439.839
i don't find out so thanks a lot for

2437.76 --> 2444.1600000000003
that gadget inspector though yeah i

2439.839 --> 2446.0
can't blame him for you telling me that

2444.16 --> 2447.1189999999997
you believe bacteria exists yeah of

2446.0 --> 2449.28
course

2447.119 --> 2451.839
they do exist bacteria do exist he

2449.28 --> 2453.52
doesn't deny that either they're just

2451.839 --> 2456.56
part of yeah

2453.52 --> 2456.56
of your ecology

2463.04 --> 2471.119
no no we need bacteria bacteria are part

2468.079 --> 2472.6400000000003
of our ecology

2471.119 --> 2476.0
we need it

2472.64 --> 2476.0
bacteria good

2476.8 --> 2479.119
good

2479.44 --> 2481.839
helpful

2483.92 --> 2488.2400000000002
germ theory isn't debunked yes it is

2489.2 --> 2496.64
yeah germs don't cause disease

2493.76 --> 2500.0
scientifically proven so keep lulling

2496.64 --> 2502.7999999999997
for me go and watch the documentary

2500.0 --> 2506.359
video that i posted the link to

2502.8 --> 2506.3590000000004
and find out

2508.96 --> 2512.11
[Music]

2535.44 --> 2539.88
tears of laughter what's so funny

2554.56 --> 2559.0
hey jeff gas head welcome back

2564.88 --> 2568.8
oh pgcnet

2566.64 --> 2572.24
look if you don't remember somebody's

2568.8 --> 2573.8390000000004
name then remember their traits

2572.24 --> 2576.4799999999996
yeah if you don't remember somebody's

2573.839 --> 2579.68
name wait welcome to my world i'm

2576.48 --> 2581.92
terrible at names

2579.68 --> 2584.48
but i am

2581.92 --> 2587.359
good at figuring out who they are by

2584.48 --> 2589.599
just the descriptions and like what did

2587.359 --> 2591.44
he talk about what did he bring forward

2589.599 --> 2592.96
what is he probably the most widely

2591.44 --> 2595.599
known for

2592.96 --> 2598.16
and then you can't much easier find out

2595.599 --> 2598.1600000000003
who he is

2600.88 --> 2603.52
even white

2604.0 --> 2607.76
no plausible oh okay well if you're

2606.079 --> 2608.7200000000003
gonna watch it like that

2607.76 --> 2611.8390000000004
ah

2608.72 --> 2611.839
ah metal slugs

2617.76 --> 2622.6400000000003
dude

2619.76 --> 2624.3190000000004
what he says has nothing to do with not

2622.64 --> 2628.56
plausible

2624.319 --> 2631.2
it's all researched it's all historical

2628.56 --> 2635.2799999999997
historical he has

2631.2 --> 2637.4399999999996
the history of medical science

2635.28 --> 2640.3190000000004
of germ theory

2637.44 --> 2642.96
andrew kaufman ah yeah yeah

2640.319 --> 2646.72
we i thought you were gonna mention him

2642.96 --> 2646.7200000000003
it's just so weird how that works

2647.04 --> 2653.2799999999997
yeah he's pretty uh epic

2651.44 --> 2656.4
that's right term theory has not been

2653.28 --> 2660.0
validated in this very specific video

2656.4 --> 2660.0
that i link to and i'll do it again

2660.64 --> 2663.64
right

2665.119 --> 2670.2400000000002
there he spent a considerable

2668.48 --> 2672.16
amount of time

2670.24 --> 2675.52
literally showing you

2672.16 --> 2676.64
every single attempt every single

2675.52 --> 2677.839
attempt

2676.64 --> 2679.5989999999997
right

2677.839 --> 2682.24
where doctors

2679.599 --> 2685.2000000000003
medical researchers laboratories have

2682.24 --> 2689.04
actually attempted to prove germ theory

2685.2 --> 2690.56
he took every example with like freaking

2689.04 --> 2693.44
video footage

2690.56 --> 2694.16
article references research he took it

2693.44 --> 2696.4
all

2694.16 --> 2700.24
he took all of it

2696.4 --> 2703.44
and it's all a fraud it's right there

2700.24 --> 2705.68
yeah so you don't think so it's not

2703.44 --> 2706.8
plausible well that's just you being in

2705.68 --> 2709.68
denial

2706.8 --> 2712.4
like globals being in denial that the

2709.68 --> 2712.3999999999996
earth is flat

2714.72 --> 2717.5989999999997
yeah that's uh

2717.76 --> 2720.6400000000003
derpcon 4

2727.76 --> 2733.5200000000004
right this link this video is the most

2730.96 --> 2736.48
extensive detailed

2733.52 --> 2741.839
medical information documentary that i

2736.48 --> 2744.16
have ever seen in my life so far

2741.839 --> 2747.92
yeah

2744.16 --> 2750.72
it is the most extensive one and all the

2747.92 --> 2754.4
previous extremely extensive ones all

2750.72 --> 2756.16
come from this channel so this is like

2754.4 --> 2758.1800000000003
a masterpiece

2756.16 --> 2759.68
and he knows it

2758.18 --> 2762.24
[Music]

2759.68 --> 2766.72
anyway let me share the

2762.24 --> 2766.72
derp alert or the derpcon chart

2767.04 --> 2770.64
just want to share that with you

2772.839 --> 2782.319
guys i thought that is appropriate since

2777.839 --> 2782.319
did have an actual derp alert

2784.48 --> 2787.48
okay

2800.4 --> 2803.7200000000003
there you go

2803.92 --> 2808.079
this is the derpcon

2805.76 --> 2808.079
chart

2808.17 --> 2811.349
[Music]

2813.92 --> 2818.319
nope it's not

2815.44 --> 2821.359
ah well

2818.319 --> 2824.19
keep it to yourselves then okay because

2821.359 --> 2825.44
your denial

2824.19 --> 2828.0
[Music]

2825.44 --> 2830.56
there's nothing uh

2828.0 --> 2832.24
you can do with that here

2830.56 --> 2836.24
yeah

2832.24 --> 2838.0789999999997
i've gone from this perspective for

2836.24 --> 2839.359
half a decade

2838.079 --> 2842.48
it works

2839.359 --> 2844.64
and there's much much more to even be

2842.48 --> 2846.88
figured out beside

2844.64 --> 2846.8799999999997
that

2856.319 --> 2862.96
there's something weird going on

2859.359 --> 2866.359
my windows photo viewer

2862.96 --> 2866.359
what the hell

2877.92 --> 2881.48
coming up

2887.599 --> 2891.119
yeah another derpcon 4

2891.52 --> 2897.08
it's the same guy

2893.16 --> 2897.08
[Music]

2908.4 --> 2912.8
immediate scatter gun straw man

2910.24 --> 2914.5589999999997
scattergunning right constant castroman

2912.8 --> 2916.96
scattergun it's the first thing on

2914.559 --> 2919.28
derpcon 4 that is exactly what he's

2916.96 --> 2919.28
doing

2925.76 --> 2930.4
derpcon 6 rumpus no no

2928.8 --> 2933.44
rumpus is

2930.4 --> 2933.44
derpcon 5.

2934.079 --> 2938.6400000000003
there is no higher than dude have you

2936.0 --> 2940.48
actually read what's in there

2938.64 --> 2943.2
okay there is no

2940.48 --> 2945.04
beyond derpcon like when you go beyond

2943.2 --> 2947.68
derp confine

2945.04 --> 2950.079
you become like a terrorist

2947.68 --> 2954.5989999999997
you actually start killing right there's

2950.079 --> 2954.599
there is no beyond their confinement

2964.079 --> 2971.48
i mean you're already pretty much insane

2966.96 --> 2971.48
and possessed by evil

2979.04 --> 2982.5589999999997
there yeah i think we gotta

2982.72 --> 2989.2
see

2985.119 --> 2989.2000000000003
it's a pretty steady derpcon 4

2993.119 --> 2996.96
although

2995.44 --> 2999.28
you could say

2996.96 --> 3001.839
attempt yeah psychological blackmail

2999.28 --> 3001.8390000000004
attempt

3002.64 --> 3009.52
constant slanderous at homes

3005.68 --> 3012.5589999999997
focused bullying yeah i think he is

3009.52 --> 3013.92
derfcon 5 at this point

3012.559 --> 3017.119
right

3013.92 --> 3018.079
a lot of derpcon activity

3017.119 --> 3021.44
like

3018.079 --> 3023.6800000000003
when they get into it it does get worse

3021.44 --> 3026.4
right so it's very normal if somebody's

3023.68 --> 3030.16
gonna enter start as a darpcon 4 that

3026.4 --> 3031.76
they will turn into a derpcon 5.

3030.16 --> 3034.0789999999997
see

3031.76 --> 3036.48
so this is

3034.079 --> 3038.88
it's all like fully and silly it's so

3036.48 --> 3041.52
funny right but it is actually very

3038.88 --> 3044.48
seriously thought through

3041.52 --> 3047.44
because i don't make things unless

3044.48 --> 3049.359
i can very seriously

3047.44 --> 3051.04
think them through

3049.359 --> 3054.04
so otherwise it's just a waste of my

3051.04 --> 3054.04
time

3054.72 --> 3059.52
i don't like to produce things that are

3056.96 --> 3059.52
pointless

3061.44 --> 3065.28
so think of this as like a uh

3065.359 --> 3073.0
a quantum of conscious style chart

3069.359 --> 3073.0
because it does apply

3084.16 --> 3089.64
make it terrible what the hell are you

3085.92 --> 3089.64
talking about godzilla

3100.559 --> 3105.52
i've had plenty of moments

3102.88 --> 3107.92
especially when i was younger

3105.52 --> 3110.64
when i was thinking oh my god i figured

3107.92 --> 3112.96
it all out it's amazing yeah i didn't

3110.64 --> 3114.0789999999997
need freaking pot for that i just had

3112.96 --> 3117.76
that

3114.079 --> 3120.319
i was just like under

3117.76 --> 3122.8
drugged by my own brain

3120.319 --> 3126.079
right and yeah when i did start smoking

3122.8 --> 3128.48
pot in the beginning i did definitely

3126.079 --> 3132.48
have those moments and then like

3128.48 --> 3134.559
realize like wow this is all [ __ ]

3132.48 --> 3137.28
so

3134.559 --> 3139.8390000000004
i've learned to contain that

3137.28 --> 3142.7200000000003
right i don't get tricked by cannabis

3139.839 --> 3142.72
like that anymore

3145.92 --> 3148.92
anyway

3161.2 --> 3167.839
what smokers don't think things through

3163.44 --> 3167.839
well in the beginning godzilla

3169.52 --> 3174.079
right

3170.4 --> 3176.88
it is true it it just is freaking true

3174.079 --> 3179.2000000000003
people that are pot smokers

3176.88 --> 3181.52
when they start out yeah it influences

3179.2 --> 3184.72
you a lot

3181.52 --> 3186.0
it will make you slow

3184.72 --> 3188.7999999999997
it

3186.0 --> 3191.2
it will give you wild inspiration

3188.8 --> 3192.4
towards that will amount to absolute

3191.2 --> 3193.68
nonsense

3192.4 --> 3196.319
it does that

3193.68 --> 3199.2799999999997
a lot of drugs i think do that but yeah

3196.319 --> 3201.92
i've had that phase

3199.28 --> 3203.2000000000003
once you get over that

3201.92 --> 3204.96
then

3203.2 --> 3206.48
it it doesn't really happen like that

3204.96 --> 3208.88
anymore and you

3206.48 --> 3211.44
use it much more carefully

3208.88 --> 3213.52
much more anticipating of what exactly

3211.44 --> 3217.4
will happen

3213.52 --> 3217.4
so you don't get fooled

3229.44 --> 3233.04
anyone that name that fits that

3230.96 --> 3234.319
description

3233.04 --> 3237.52
yeah

3234.319 --> 3240.0
a lot of people brenda

3237.52 --> 3242.4
rumpus

3240.0 --> 3246.559
most flat anti-flat earthers are quite

3242.4 --> 3249.599
paranoid towards flat earthers

3246.559 --> 3253.0400000000004
but in in a way with them

3249.599 --> 3255.52
that's not even strange because they are

3253.04 --> 3257.359
just to our mercy and they know it they

3255.52 --> 3259.359
are our prey

3257.359 --> 3262.0789999999997
so in a way they should be a little

3259.359 --> 3263.44
paranoid because they are unrepented

3262.079 --> 3266.4
[ __ ] with

3263.44 --> 3267.68
self-deluded idiots

3266.4 --> 3271.44
and we

3267.68 --> 3274.3999999999996
slay them with facts

3271.44 --> 3277.599
so that their bit paranoid towards us

3274.4 --> 3280.319
isn't really all that

3277.599 --> 3280.319
but natural

3288.96 --> 3292.96
paranoid as in calling other people paid

3291.52 --> 3294.559
chills

3292.96 --> 3297.599
no

3294.559 --> 3300.6400000000003
paranoid as in just literally

3297.599 --> 3303.76
never trusting a flat earther

3300.64 --> 3306.5589999999997
always assuming that they're evil right

3303.76 --> 3309.0400000000004
why don't you look further down list oh

3306.559 --> 3311.599
yeah i didn't present it right

3309.04 --> 3311.599
anymore

3315.04 --> 3318.799
but yeah

3316.64 --> 3320.319
they make up reversed world conspiracy

3318.799 --> 3322.72
theories about planet earth thinking

3320.319 --> 3325.2799999999997
that our flag earth is is all controlled

3322.72 --> 3327.7599999999998
opposition it's there to fool you away

3325.28 --> 3330.0
from the globe like it's a satanic

3327.76 --> 3333.3590000000004
organization that just wants to prevent

3330.0 --> 3335.839
us from going to the stars

3333.359 --> 3335.839
that [ __ ]

3336.319 --> 3339.359

3337.28 --> 3342.3590000000004

3569.16 --> 3573.52
disobeying god and that they are paying

3585.599 --> 3590.6400000000003
i am just not giving a [ __ ]

3589.599 --> 3594.079
whether

3590.64 --> 3596.64
she is a he or a she

3594.079 --> 3599.44
it's not important like she is freaking

when you do that

3608.799 --> 3614.319
just stop it

3610.48 --> 3617.28
stop acting like a [ __ ] [ __ ] and

3614.319 --> 3620.799
get to the actual higher level of

thinking facts deal with that

3620.799 --> 3623.119
yeah

3623.359 --> 3628.24
or is it that brenda is just smarter

3625.76 --> 3631.3590000000004
than you gadget inspector do you have to

3628.24 --> 3632.3999999999996
go there do you have to actually poke

3631.359 --> 3635.119
her over

3632.4 --> 3636.2400000000002
see because she's actually smarter than

3635.119 --> 3638.2400000000002
you

3636.24 --> 3641.1189999999997
i would understand that

3638.24 --> 3642.5589999999997
because then it would just be a petty

3641.119 --> 3644.319
attitude

3642.559 --> 3647.6800000000003
because she is

3644.319 --> 3650.96
actually smart [ __ ] insane

3647.68 --> 3653.2
devious demonic but she is smart

3650.96 --> 3657.04
probably smarter than you

3653.2 --> 3659.839
probably smarter than right to hand

3657.04 --> 3659.839
you understand

3668.319 --> 3671.839
yeah shots fired indeed

3673.119 --> 3678.96
you looked at you triggered well is that

3675.599 --> 3682.839
gonna accomplish anything

3678.96 --> 3685.76
is your policy going to accomplish

3682.839 --> 3689.2799999999997
anything are you just overcompensating

3685.76 --> 3691.5200000000004
for your lack of intelligence

3689.28 --> 3695.48
that she's actually smarter than you

3691.52 --> 3695.48
despite being deranged

3698.16 --> 3704.0
she is not here yes yes so it is

3702.48 --> 3706.799
it is isn't it

3704.0 --> 3708.0
it really is i called it she's smarter

3706.799 --> 3709.92
than you

3708.0 --> 3712.319
you're not even willing to admit it to

3709.92 --> 3715.76
yourself so you're just acting like a

3712.319 --> 3717.92
juvenile [ __ ]

3715.76 --> 3719.119
it's actually

3717.92 --> 3721.44
i win

3719.119 --> 3724.44
but you're still more [ __ ] than her

3721.44 --> 3724.44
though

3729.039 --> 3734.3190000000004
i'm too smart to have no no i'm too

3731.28 --> 3735.8390000000004
smart not to have prejudice

3734.319 --> 3736.72
break back

3735.839 --> 3739.0389999999998
yeah

3736.72 --> 3742.799
i'm flipping this [ __ ]

3739.039 --> 3742.7990000000004
back to where it should be

3742.88 --> 3749.6800000000003
yeah everything's been turned around no

3745.76 --> 3751.039
prejudice is a sign of intelligence

3749.68 --> 3754.48
it means

3751.039 --> 3757.039
you understand how things work

3754.48 --> 3759.76
and that there's existential problems

3757.039 --> 3762.2400000000002
that come with sin

3759.76 --> 3764.88
and that freedom has a price and that

3762.24 --> 3767.0389999999998
price is pretty high

3764.88 --> 3770.319
and that price carries on over the

3767.039 --> 3773.3590000000004
generations yeah your children pay the

3770.319 --> 3776.24
price for your actions

3773.359 --> 3778.4
yeah i am smart enough to have prejudice

3776.24 --> 3780.5589999999997
rig back don't

3778.4 --> 3783.119
don't pull that liberal [ __ ] trick

3780.559 --> 3785.52
on me it doesn't work anymore

3783.119 --> 3787.92
i'm doing exactly the opposite

3785.52 --> 3791.0389999999998
i'm actually making effort

3787.92 --> 3793.039
effort to be more prejudice you

3791.039 --> 3795.76
understand

3793.039 --> 3798.6400000000003
because we've had enough [ __ ]

3795.76 --> 3800.48
tolerance already yeah

3798.64 --> 3802.5589999999997
i'm done with that [ __ ]

3800.48 --> 3805.68
everything in the world right now is

3802.559 --> 3807.28
getting worse because of tolerance

3805.68 --> 3809.359
because we don't want to be prejudiced

3807.28 --> 3810.96
we don't want to be uncivilized well

3809.359 --> 3812.88
[ __ ] you

3810.96 --> 3815.039
look at where you're at you think you're

3812.88 --> 3816.799
civilized you think you're civilized in

3815.039 --> 3819.119
this world

3816.799 --> 3820.72
think that those actions are gonna

3819.119 --> 3822.2400000000002
improve it

3820.72 --> 3825.52
no it's not

3822.24 --> 3827.5989999999997
we need prejudice

3825.52 --> 3830.16
prejudice is born

3827.599 --> 3835.2400000000002
naturally

3830.16 --> 3835.24
and god approves of it

3839.68 --> 3843.5989999999997
no it doesn't

3841.119 --> 3846.88
prejudice is natural

3843.599 --> 3849.119
prejudice is good

3846.88 --> 3851.2000000000003
right does it mean that you should

3849.119 --> 3853.039
automatically say oh

3851.2 --> 3854.24
this person is

3853.039 --> 3857.039
like

3854.24 --> 3859.1189999999997
like less than human like they're

3857.039 --> 3860.559
they're like trash like you can kill

3859.119 --> 3862.88
them or something right they're not

3860.559 --> 3865.039
worth it no no no no that's not what i'm

3862.88 --> 3867.92
saying though right that's not my route

3865.039 --> 3870.079
of prejudice my root of prejudice

3867.92 --> 3872.7200000000003
well yeah it is discernment

3870.079 --> 3874.48
but it's more than discernment it's not

3872.72 --> 3876.8799999999997
discernment and then keeping it to

3874.48 --> 3879.68
myself it is discernment and then

3876.88 --> 3881.6800000000003
smashing it in your face

3879.68 --> 3882.96
yeah and that's called prejudice these

3881.68 --> 3886.319
days

3882.96 --> 3888.96
i'm just being really freaking honest

3886.319 --> 3891.2
and i got a point

3888.96 --> 3892.839
i got a point with it

3891.2 --> 3896.16
and you can call that

3892.839 --> 3898.96
prejudice i don't yeah i don't mind i'm

3896.16 --> 3901.7599999999998
just not afraid i'm not afraid you

3898.96 --> 3903.119
understand call me prejudice all you

3901.76 --> 3907.28
want

3903.119 --> 3910.799
i am prejudice i embrace it yeah because

3907.28 --> 3912.1600000000003
why because the beast system

3910.799 --> 3913.92
tells you

3912.16 --> 3915.92
you bad

3913.92 --> 3917.039
if you prejudice

3915.92 --> 3921.359
huh

3917.039 --> 3921.3590000000004
so i'm doing the opposite then

3921.44 --> 3927.119
but arwen you might offend somebody good

3924.96 --> 3929.92
yeah when people get offended they wake

3927.119 --> 3930.88
the [ __ ] up

3929.92 --> 3936.28
good

3930.88 --> 3936.28
be offended wake the [ __ ] up

3944.88 --> 3948.079
right

3945.86 --> 3950.7200000000003
[Music]

3948.079 --> 3952.88
anyway i appreciate the

3950.72 --> 3954.799
the subtle correction it is more

3952.88 --> 3957.039
discernment than prejudice it's just

3954.799 --> 3959.28
that

3957.039 --> 3963.7200000000003
prejudice is just a

3959.28 --> 3963.7200000000003
a communist word in my opinion

3965.68 --> 3969.0389999999998
because all these things come from

3967.2 --> 3971.9199999999996
natural impulses

3969.039 --> 3971.92
of a reason

3972.72 --> 3979.68
and they're being taken away from us

3976.839 --> 3982.4
right oh you're bridges you can't you

3979.68 --> 3986.799
can think that you can say that

3982.4 --> 3986.799
yeah i [ __ ] can and i [ __ ]

3990.839 --> 3995.52
will it's the opposite of discernment

3993.52 --> 3997.52
yeah well in this reversed freaking

3995.52 --> 4000.559
world

3997.52 --> 4003.52
they call discernment prejudice

4000.559 --> 4007.8390000000004
and they declare prejudice discernment

4003.52 --> 4007.839
so i'm flipping it right back

4011.839 --> 4017.0
a drunken bullet 411 hello thanks

4020.0 --> 4024.0
you're prejudiced towards chocolate

4025.52 --> 4028.799
hey slow mo moon buggy

4029.52 --> 4033.28
right

4030.96 --> 4036.16
so yeah let's just put it on the table

4033.28 --> 4037.119
i'm very prejudiced against openly gay

4036.16 --> 4039.839
people

4037.119 --> 4042.88
now think that it's okay

4039.839 --> 4046.319
that one to normalize it that want to

4042.88 --> 4048.88
turn the world into gay accepting

4046.319 --> 4050.4
i have a lot of prejudice against that i

4048.88 --> 4052.1600000000003
do not have prejudice against

4050.4 --> 4055.839
homosexuals that are willing to

4052.16 --> 4057.92
completely keep it to themselves

4055.839 --> 4059.92
right

4057.92 --> 4062.4
and with that i mean completely to

4059.92 --> 4066.16
themselves who recognize that the beast

4062.4 --> 4069.119
system is promoting that aberrant

4066.16 --> 4070.16
sinful behavior which it is and remains

4069.119 --> 4072.4
right

4070.16 --> 4075.2799999999997
people can live with sin you just

4072.4 --> 4078.559
realize the price

4075.28 --> 4079.52
and you honor what is true

4078.559 --> 4081.119
truth

4079.52 --> 4083.599
that it is a sin

4081.119 --> 4084.88
then you can have a very good honorable

4083.599 --> 4086.88
life

4084.88 --> 4089.119
and people will respect you even if you

4086.88 --> 4090.6400000000003
are gay because they probably won't know

4089.119 --> 4092.48
that you're gay

4090.64 --> 4094.5589999999997
and even if they found out they'll still

4092.48 --> 4096.64
be like wow but that he's a really great

4094.559 --> 4099.12
guy though and we learn so much from him

4096.64 --> 4100.08
and he's not like gross

4099.12 --> 4103.3589999999995
right

4100.08 --> 4105.12
so that's fine i'm not saying oh kill

4103.359 --> 4108.08
all the gays no

4105.12 --> 4110.4
no dude

4108.08 --> 4110.4
i mean

4112.799 --> 4119.04
it's just this open normalization has

4115.839 --> 4122.3189999999995
got to go

4119.04 --> 4122.319
that's the problem i have

4127.52 --> 4130.319
right godzilla

4130.56 --> 4136.080000000001
that's racist

4132.56 --> 4136.080000000001
i don't eat any chocolate

4136.48 --> 4141.44
oh i used to love chocolate as a kid

4138.799 --> 4141.44
though but

4144.799 --> 4147.839
what the hell

4152.48 --> 4158.678999999999
you have to flip the upside down right

4154.96 --> 4158.679
side up that's right

4160.88 --> 4166.08
dude there's some

4162.48 --> 4166.08
and like we need to hurry up

4166.159 --> 4170.4
really like time is running out guys

4170.64 --> 4175.839
i mean the the dark ones are getting

4173.359 --> 4175.839
darker

4176.159 --> 4181.2789999999995
and darker is not like oh not again no

4179.359 --> 4183.1990000000005
darker

4181.279 --> 4187.0
more evil

4183.199 --> 4187.0
more doubling down

4190.96 --> 4194.08
i mean like ugh

4194.159 --> 4197.5199999999995
at this point i don't want to bring it

4195.84 --> 4199.6
up really

4197.52 --> 4201.1990000000005
but in the netherlands like

4199.6 --> 4204.2390000000005
there's just like

4201.199 --> 4206.96
certain police factions here

4204.239 --> 4210.08
like around amsterdam i think

4206.96 --> 4211.92
i'm not entirely sure where it is

4210.08 --> 4214.32
because police over here seem really

4211.92 --> 4216.88
fine i mean i'm

4214.32 --> 4218.32
they're fine

4216.88 --> 4220.56
but

4218.32 --> 4222.639999999999
like they're just

4220.56 --> 4227.120000000001
like assaulting

4222.64 --> 4229.76
people that like want to join protests

4227.12 --> 4232.32
like this fisher

4229.76 --> 4234.400000000001
this boat wanted to go over to like the

4232.32 --> 4236.5599999999995
farm protest

4234.4 --> 4238.0
which is like very critical because if

4236.56 --> 4239.76
that farm

4238.0 --> 4242.08
if the government's gonna do what

4239.76 --> 4244.56
they're saying they're doing with the

4242.08 --> 4246.88
nitrogen issue which is literally a

4244.56 --> 4250.159000000001
non-issue it's going to literally

4246.88 --> 4252.56
destroy the entire country like

4250.159 --> 4255.36
irrevocably

4252.56 --> 4256.8
right this is this is like a a death

4255.36 --> 4259.44
move

4256.8 --> 4260.159000000001
by the beast system and we have to stop

4259.44 --> 4263.04
it

4260.159 --> 4265.36
with violence if necessary

4263.04 --> 4267.44
although yeah that's not gonna happen of

4265.36 --> 4270.0
course during a [ __ ] protest so

4267.44 --> 4272.4
that's [ __ ] they're gonna protest of

4270.0 --> 4274.8
course it's not gonna be like that

4272.4 --> 4276.0
that's pointless right hey hey

4274.8 --> 4278.64
government

4276.0 --> 4280.0
you [ __ ] numb peace

4278.64 --> 4281.280000000001
if you're actually going to be

4280.0 --> 4286.239
overthrown you think it's going to

4281.28 --> 4289.12
happen during a protest you [ __ ] wits

4286.239 --> 4292.5599999999995
are you just paranoid and [ __ ] to

4289.12 --> 4296.8
make yourself look even worse

4292.56 --> 4296.8
these yeah these police boats just like

4297.76 --> 4302.08
they basically rammed a fisherman

4300.8 --> 4305.04
to

4302.08 --> 4310.32
prevent them from going to the protest

4305.04 --> 4310.32
absolutely illegal totally illegal

4310.64 --> 4313.52
i mean

4311.76 --> 4316.320000000001
who knows man the united states or

4313.52 --> 4320.0
whatever or england or australia that

4316.32 --> 4321.679
might be normal over here that's like

4320.0 --> 4325.76
no

4321.679 --> 4326.56
no you're not gonna [ __ ] do that

4325.76 --> 4327.360000000001
and

4326.56 --> 4329.1990000000005
i'm

4327.36 --> 4330.239
yelling in the article basically like

4329.199 --> 4332.639999999999
this

4330.239 --> 4335.759999999999
they all have to be fired this is so

4332.64 --> 4337.52
corrupted like that entire department

4335.76 --> 4339.76
and probably the chief

4337.52 --> 4341.280000000001
of the police there that basically

4339.76 --> 4344.96
greenlighted that

4341.28 --> 4346.48
that policy should be fired immediately

4344.96 --> 4348.32
without pension

4346.48 --> 4351.32
get the [ __ ] out

4348.32 --> 4351.32
immediately

4358.66 --> 4362.79
[Music]

4364.0 --> 4369.36
like what the hell does that mean

4367.36 --> 4372.159
they're not in control

4369.36 --> 4372.159
that's the point

4374.88 --> 4379.12
they are in control they're controlling

4377.679 --> 4382.4800000000005
us

4379.12 --> 4382.48
they're controlling policy

4383.28 --> 4388.4
and that's not a good thing

4385.04 --> 4391.199
we should be controlling them

4388.4 --> 4391.199
through law

4391.44 --> 4396.08
through public opinion

4394.719 --> 4397.28
but they are

4396.08 --> 4399.84
actually

4397.28 --> 4401.12
moving towards completely ignoring that

4399.84 --> 4404.0
and a more of

4401.12 --> 4405.76
authoritarian structure of doing things

4404.0 --> 4408.8
and that is intolerable and should be

4405.76 --> 4410.8
resisted with violence if necessary

4408.8 --> 4414.719
because if you don't we're literally

4410.8 --> 4414.719
going to end up just like australia here

4416.32 --> 4423.599999999999
governments are what

4418.48 --> 4423.599999999999
well who gives a [ __ ] told what to do

4423.679 --> 4428.56
who gives a [ __ ] told what to do

4426.8 --> 4431.679
yeah doing that

4428.56 --> 4433.84
doing what you're told to do means

4431.679 --> 4436.32
treachery

4433.84 --> 4437.360000000001
that means treachery that means you

4436.32 --> 4440.719
should be

4437.36 --> 4442.719
dragged out of your house and beaten and

4440.719 --> 4444.4
kicked out of the country

4442.719 --> 4446.4
at least right

4444.4 --> 4448.5599999999995
don't ever do spin only over here well

4446.4 --> 4450.96
yeah

4448.56 --> 4455.2390000000005
if you do that then you're immediately a

4450.96 --> 4455.2390000000005
traitor an infiltrator

4457.84 --> 4465.8
government needs to do what the public

4461.12 --> 4465.8
tells them to do and the constitution

4474.88 --> 4479.52
it seems super no it's not supernatural

4477.199 --> 4481.919999999999
it's called a program right back it's a

4479.52 --> 4485.1990000000005
program it's not supernatural it's

4481.92 --> 4488.56
called a program they got like

4485.199 --> 4490.4
the new scripture their program you

4488.56 --> 4492.56
understand it's the program they're

4490.4 --> 4494.639999999999
using it like a religion they have a

4492.56 --> 4498.080000000001
program they have a system it's totally

4494.64 --> 4500.88
a newman and it's just like follow this

4498.08 --> 4502.08
program and then you get the benefits of

4500.88 --> 4503.84
the cults

4502.08 --> 4505.28
that's what it is it's not that

4503.84 --> 4507.1990000000005
mysterious

4505.28 --> 4509.5199999999995
they just have a program

4507.199 --> 4511.919999999999
a program with objectives long-term

4509.52 --> 4513.92
strategies that's how you do it

4511.92 --> 4516.2390000000005
you don't do it then you're not part of

4513.92 --> 4519.12
the crew then you don't get the benefits

4516.239 --> 4521.5199999999995
that's how it works

4519.12 --> 4524.08
it's fascism it's like a corporate

4521.52 --> 4525.120000000001
conspiracy

4524.08 --> 4527.5199999999995
corrupt

4525.12 --> 4530.4
people in key parts of government

4527.52 --> 4533.679
and it is corruption and it is treason

4530.4 --> 4533.679
like high treason

4533.76 --> 4540.08
and that's how they operate and it's

4535.92 --> 4542.159
because of sheer tolerance

4540.08 --> 4544.719
that they're getting away with it

4542.159 --> 4546.5599999999995
because everybody said numpty [ __ ]

4544.719 --> 4550.56
they've been indoctrinated oh don't be

4546.56 --> 4553.04
mean don't be mean oh

4550.56 --> 4557.84
you have to be peaceful with me yeah

4553.04 --> 4562.08
yeah yeah that's why they're doing it

4557.84 --> 4565.1990000000005
because of that and because people are

4562.08 --> 4568.64
listening to the indoctrination

4565.199 --> 4572.0
to turn them into a passivist

4568.64 --> 4575.4400000000005
numpty slave

4572.0 --> 4575.44
yeah you think that oh

4575.78 --> 4578.96
[Applause]

4576.88 --> 4581.52
ineffective you think that that's the

4578.96 --> 4583.76
only propaganda no that's the propaganda

4581.52 --> 4586.0
that's the more aggressive part

4583.76 --> 4589.76
the subtle part

4586.0 --> 4592.64
is the part that you've already accepted

4589.76 --> 4595.12
because that's already been there for

4592.64 --> 4597.12
your entire life probably

4595.12 --> 4599.5199999999995
for half a century's

4597.12 --> 4601.12
been rolling out

4599.52 --> 4602.96
just oh

4601.12 --> 4606.5599999999995
so don't be mean

4602.96 --> 4608.4800000000005
don't be intolerant don't be racist yeah

4606.56 --> 4610.96
yeah yeah they can go further and

4608.48 --> 4615.04
further and further and further yeah

4610.96 --> 4615.04
yeah that's the long-term problem

4615.6 --> 4620.96
yeah

4616.64 --> 4624.88
the indoctrination of tolerance

4620.96 --> 4629.12
that is the fundamental problem that is

4624.88 --> 4631.1990000000005
making the western world into a fascist

4629.12 --> 4634.599999999999
nightmare

4631.199 --> 4634.599999999999
its tolerance

4636.88 --> 4641.8
tolerance of that which should not be

4638.8 --> 4641.8
tolerated

4643.65 --> 4646.849999999999
[Music]

4649.07 --> 4656.339
[Music]

4693.12 --> 4696.88
now there's no point

4699.28 --> 4707.84
yeah but it's a five right it's a five

4703.52 --> 4707.84
right spamming crazy subjects

4709.04 --> 4712.96
right

4710.32 --> 4714.4
that's five it's not a 4.8 it's just

4712.96 --> 4718.199
five

4714.4 --> 4718.199
very much a5

4723.76 --> 4727.84
but you don't need

4725.28 --> 4730.639999999999
look you don't need to have every single

4727.84 --> 4733.679
factor you just need to size up

4730.64 --> 4736.719
how far they go right you just need one

4733.679 --> 4739.4400000000005
factor in the derpcon chart to determine

4736.719 --> 4741.76
what the derpcon level is

4739.44 --> 4744.32
it's not about oh it needs to have all

4741.76 --> 4747.6
of that no it just you just need to hit

4744.32 --> 4750.96
the right derpcon level

4747.6 --> 4755.280000000001
because it is ordered by intensity

4750.96 --> 4755.28
by how intense the derp is

4756.8 --> 4760.76
do i need to show it again

4792.07 --> 4795.25
[Music]

4797.28 --> 4804.159
who invented the derpcon chart i i did i

4800.239 --> 4805.44
literally made it in photoshop yesterday

4804.159 --> 4808.32
and it is

4805.44 --> 4810.799999999999
well i i devised the derpcon terminology

4808.32 --> 4812.0
but it was seeking star water that

4810.8 --> 4814.2390000000005
really

4812.0 --> 4816.159
put the seed in the ground with her derp

4814.239 --> 4819.159
alert

4816.159 --> 4819.159
right

4819.44 --> 4825.599999999999
so she pretty much came up with the

4821.6 --> 4825.6
concept and i made it into this

4828.0 --> 4831.199
so thanks

4830.08 --> 4832.8
i'm

4831.199 --> 4834.0
i think it is

4832.8 --> 4836.400000000001
valuable

4834.0 --> 4838.08
like because again

4836.4 --> 4842.96
this is a

4838.08 --> 4845.28
psychological social response chart

4842.96 --> 4847.679
it can be converted

4845.28 --> 4850.48
to other fields

4847.679 --> 4850.4800000000005
yes it can

4858.32 --> 4861.599999999999
hey kevlar

4862.48 --> 4867.04
i mean i'm not

4864.32 --> 4867.04
i mean buy

4869.6 --> 4872.320000000001
just buyer

4870.96 --> 4875.04
tarot

4872.32 --> 4877.44
right

4875.04 --> 4879.84
i think that that would help her more

4877.44 --> 4882.159
but donate to my paypal

4879.84 --> 4882.159000000001
please

4884.48 --> 4889.919999999999
just buy seeking star wars tarot

4887.76 --> 4892.08
and donate to my paypal and then

4889.92 --> 4894.159
everything is cool

4892.08 --> 4895.12
[Music]

4894.159 --> 4898.5199999999995
oh

4895.12 --> 4898.5199999999995
thanks drunkenbullet411

4910.88 --> 4914.0
oh

4912.719 --> 4915.679
wow

4914.0 --> 4918.96
thank you

4915.679 --> 4918.96
that is very helpful

4928.84 --> 4933.360000000001
yeah thank you very much drunkenwolf401

4932.08 --> 4936.159
i love it

4933.36 --> 4936.159
love the sport

4936.8 --> 4941.92
what does scattergunny mean

4939.76 --> 4944.719
well scatter gunning is a description

4941.92 --> 4946.56
it's just like at home

4944.719 --> 4949.28
straw man

4946.56 --> 4951.1990000000005
right scatter gunning is

4949.28 --> 4953.36
throwing one argument at you and then

4951.199 --> 4955.04
immediately and a completely different

4953.36 --> 4958.92
argument and then another different

4955.04 --> 4958.92
argument it's basically like

4961.28 --> 4965.04
pray and pray but it the effect is is

4964.08 --> 4967.36
that

4965.04 --> 4969.6
you keep saying things and then it

4967.36 --> 4972.719
becomes too much to it will take too

4969.6 --> 4974.159000000001
much time for the opponent to respond to

4972.719 --> 4975.92
everything

4974.159 --> 4978.08
that's why it's the scatter gunning

4975.92 --> 4981.04
effect it is basically piling up

4978.08 --> 4983.04
challenges so that the the opponent just

4981.04 --> 4985.28
doesn't have the time to respond that's

4983.04 --> 4986.48
the scatter gunning right

4985.28 --> 4988.719
i mean

4986.48 --> 4991.919999999999
like the really nasty anti-flat earthers

4988.719 --> 4993.52
do that non-stop they do it non-stop on

4991.92 --> 4996.159
their own channel

4993.52 --> 4998.4800000000005
it is a very typical

4996.159 --> 5000.0
baller trait really an anti-flat earther

4998.48 --> 5004.638999999999
trait

5000.0 --> 5004.639
like more than even in other fields

5006.639 --> 5011.679
because politicians do it too right

5009.199 --> 5013.759999999999
i mean the point is is that what makes

5011.679 --> 5016.08
scatter gunning effective even after

5013.76 --> 5018.08
everything has been disproven

5016.08 --> 5021.12
is the preponderance of it so you can

5018.08 --> 5024.48
just throw one fallacy after another and

5021.12 --> 5026.719
if you just name 10 fallacies really

5024.48 --> 5028.799999999999
really loudly and enthusiastically with

5026.719 --> 5032.4
a lot of confidence right you just keep

5028.8 --> 5034.2390000000005
staying 10 fallacies in a row

5032.4 --> 5035.28
then the other one's just going to be

5034.239 --> 5037.44
like

5035.28 --> 5039.12
this is all wrong but they don't they're

5037.44 --> 5040.96
not going to get through and an

5039.12 --> 5043.28
unsuspecting audience is going to hear

5040.96 --> 5045.12
that and feel like wow i don't really

5043.28 --> 5045.84
understand this but this guy is winning

5045.12 --> 5047.76
it

5045.84 --> 5049.6
because he's giving all these arguments

5047.76 --> 5051.92
and the other can't even respond right

5049.6 --> 5054.320000000001
that's the tactic behind scatter

5051.92 --> 5054.32
learning

5054.84 --> 5059.92
right switching topics all over the

5057.6 --> 5062.719
place yeah that's the gist of it

5059.92 --> 5064.88
that's pretty much what it is

5062.719 --> 5066.719
but it is like quickly

5064.88 --> 5068.400000000001
it's not just switching from one topic

5066.719 --> 5070.88
to another it's usually like doing it

5068.4 --> 5073.28
quickly as soon as the other one has

5070.88 --> 5074.56
like figured out a

5073.28 --> 5076.639
an error

5074.56 --> 5079.52
in your argument quickly move on to the

5076.639 --> 5079.52
next argument

5082.239 --> 5088.718999999999
out here

5084.639 --> 5088.719
yeah we got serious derpcon fives

5093.76 --> 5097.1990000000005
that

5094.639 --> 5100.88
true brian's logic he does do that

5097.199 --> 5104.48
sometimes when he's in a special mood

5100.88 --> 5104.4800000000005
ah you just don't understand

5104.56 --> 5109.1990000000005
you just don't get my points

5107.6 --> 5110.88
he does do it sometimes it's a bit

5109.199 --> 5114.799999999999
annoying

5110.88 --> 5117.12
but overall it that is not scatter

5114.8 --> 5118.0
gunning compared to

5117.12 --> 5120.159
like

5118.0 --> 5122.08
standardized scatter gunning that

5120.159 --> 5125.44
anti-flat earthers do because they just

5122.08 --> 5127.6
have a row of all their assertions that

5125.44 --> 5129.678999999999
they know by heart and every single one

5127.6 --> 5131.280000000001
has been dispelled

5129.679 --> 5133.52
has been countered

5131.28 --> 5136.159
but they keep recycling them right

5133.52 --> 5138.2390000000005
they're just like bullets they just keep

5136.159 --> 5141.199
shooting fallacies at you so that you

5138.239 --> 5144.159
don't have the time to respond because

5141.199 --> 5145.599999999999
it will take more time to prove to the

5144.159 --> 5148.239
listeners

5145.6 --> 5151.1990000000005
that every one of them is wrong

5148.239 --> 5154.28
than it takes to shoot them all right in

5151.199 --> 5154.28
the moment

5158.48 --> 5162.32
brian is excruciating to listen

5165.44 --> 5169.08
i would say that

5169.199 --> 5172.239
it's just

5170.48 --> 5176.08
sometimes he's really focused and

5172.239 --> 5178.159
sometimes he's just in like a

5176.08 --> 5180.0
leprechaun mood

5178.159 --> 5183.92
then he's like ah you just don't get my

5180.0 --> 5187.36
point you just don't get any pointers

5183.92 --> 5189.84
but not always thank god

5187.36 --> 5192.4
can you over go over what sylvania means

5189.84 --> 5195.1990000000005
barely

5192.4 --> 5197.5199999999995
it is complicated

5195.199 --> 5201.12
i mean savannah is just

5197.52 --> 5203.040000000001
it is just like a a very temporary

5201.12 --> 5204.639
thingy that happened

5203.04 --> 5206.159
it's just a name that was picked

5204.639 --> 5209.36
randomly

5206.159 --> 5209.36
by owen benjamin

5209.52 --> 5213.679
but

5211.36 --> 5216.0
savonia syndrome is

5213.679 --> 5218.56
i think a better way would be calling it

5216.0 --> 5221.04
special boy syndrome

5218.56 --> 5222.84
although special bone syndrome is wider

5221.04 --> 5224.719
because sylvania syndrome

5222.84 --> 5227.84
indicates

5224.719 --> 5228.88
very typical paranoia

5227.84 --> 5231.88
and

5228.88 --> 5231.88
self-aggrandizement

5232.4 --> 5235.599999999999
both

5233.36 --> 5238.0
that's typical cefonie

5235.6 --> 5239.0
right special boy syndrome is usually

5238.0 --> 5240.8
just

5239.0 --> 5243.52
self-aggrandizement and without the

5240.8 --> 5243.52
paranoia

5245.28 --> 5249.679
dude no

5246.639 --> 5249.679
gadgets vector

5251.6 --> 5257.52
oh wait you're irish right

5254.56 --> 5259.52
um okay well if an irishman asked me to

5257.52 --> 5261.52
do an irish accent then

5259.52 --> 5263.6
well maybe then i'll just do it part of

5261.52 --> 5263.6
it

5264.159 --> 5269.199
i mean

5265.44 --> 5269.199
you just don't understand my point

5270.32 --> 5273.84
like why don't you let me finish my

5272.48 --> 5276.718999999999
sentence and then maybe you'll

5273.84 --> 5278.159000000001
understand my point it'll only take 10

5276.719 --> 5280.4
more minutes

5278.159 --> 5283.36
oh wait now it's getting indian this is

5280.4 --> 5283.36
that's incorrect

5286.639 --> 5293.0
yeah i can't really do an iris accent

5288.8 --> 5293.0
too well just a little

5296.48 --> 5298.718999999999
uh

5302.159 --> 5305.92
anyway let's get rid of the derp chart

5304.4 --> 5310.32
again

5305.92 --> 5314.08
it's a pretty good irish well

5310.32 --> 5316.5599999999995
the thing about the irish language

5314.08 --> 5318.639
is the tone you set

5316.56 --> 5321.360000000001
and just how you carry

5318.639 --> 5324.8
the words

5321.36 --> 5325.839999999999
it's very similar to scottish english

5324.8 --> 5329.12
but with

5325.84 --> 5329.12
different emphasis

5330.56 --> 5335.0
you sound just like me oh [ __ ]

5344.88 --> 5349.08
yeah drunken bullet i know

5349.17 --> 5356.64
[Music]

5363.29 --> 5368.0
[Music]

5365.76 --> 5368.96
no i'm not going to say behind my pot of

5368.0 --> 5372.08
gold

5368.96 --> 5372.08
that's why i do that

5373.28 --> 5378.5199999999995
now i'll leave that sort of thing to

5375.52 --> 5378.52
owen

5392.0 --> 5396.88
the irish can actually speak english the

5394.56 --> 5399.679
scots can't

5396.88 --> 5399.679
was because they

5400.0 --> 5405.679
go out to their way

5402.159 --> 5408.32
to like make to become as inaudible as

5405.679 --> 5410.8
humanly possible

5408.32 --> 5410.799999999999
great

5417.28 --> 5422.96
i think that maybe the scottish just

5419.12 --> 5425.44
became so inaudible just to prevent

5422.96 --> 5427.12
spies from understanding what they were

5425.44 --> 5429.919999999999
planning

5427.12 --> 5432.0
it just became inaudible so that

5429.92 --> 5433.76
like nobody could figure out like what

5432.0 --> 5436.159
they were actually planning to do with

5433.76 --> 5438.320000000001
the british

5436.159 --> 5440.32
and it sounds really silly when i say it

5438.32 --> 5442.639
like that but

5440.32 --> 5444.0
maybe there's something to that

5442.639 --> 5446.159000000001
i mean

5444.0 --> 5449.84
it's been going on between them for a

5446.159 --> 5452.239
while you know

5449.84 --> 5453.92
my scot is better

5452.239 --> 5455.599999999999
yeah

5453.92 --> 5458.88
well i understand scottish better and

5455.6 --> 5463.4800000000005
i've listened to scottish a lot more

5458.88 --> 5463.4800000000005
i really do like the scottish language

5464.159 --> 5469.44
i think i could go undercover

5467.36 --> 5472.239
in scotland just give me like a half a

5469.44 --> 5476.839999999999
year and you won't be able to tell

5472.239 --> 5476.839999999999
that i'm not a scottish citizen

5484.4 --> 5487.5199999999995
well

5485.199 --> 5489.678999999999
i mean the outsiders won't be able to

5487.52 --> 5492.159000000001
tell i mean scots will still be like

5489.679 --> 5495.96
dude that's a decent scottish accent but

5492.159 --> 5495.96
you are no scott

5498.95 --> 5502.01
[Music]

5508.88 --> 5515.36
oh i by the way i argued

5511.679 --> 5517.52
jim bob brought up scots too and skills

5515.36 --> 5522.0
and then i argued that

5517.52 --> 5523.280000000001
kilts are basically advanced jorts

5522.0 --> 5526.08
right

5523.28 --> 5527.5199999999995
the scots just realized like yeah we can

5526.08 --> 5530.5599999999995
just cut

5527.52 --> 5532.719
the legs of a of a pair of jeans or we

5530.56 --> 5535.76
could just make a skirt

5532.719 --> 5538.08
out of the whole thing

5535.76 --> 5540.639
and put like black hoods

5538.08 --> 5540.639
on there

5540.88 --> 5546.76

5609.84 --> 5614.4800000000005
not evade for anybody and then somebody

5612.239 --> 5618.159

out like like they're my arch enemy

5618.159 --> 5624.759999999999
that's that would be my

5620.96 --> 5624.76
new yorker act

5637.52 --> 5641.92
i mean that's most that's the thing that

5639.679 --> 5644.08
stands out to me the most about new york

5641.92 --> 5645.84
is that everybody's so incredibly

5644.08 --> 5649.76
[ __ ] rude

5645.84 --> 5652.400000000001
i really don't like new york

5649.76 --> 5652.400000000001
never did

5657.76 --> 5663.360000000001
yelling in the hallway yeah

5660.719 --> 5663.36
oh goody

5666.719 --> 5671.04
pakistani i don't i don't even know what

5669.28 --> 5673.92
that sounds like

5671.04 --> 5676.48
but i can do a decent

5673.92 --> 5678.96
hollywoodian

5676.48 --> 5681.599999999999
indian accent

5678.96 --> 5684.159
you already know about that

5681.6 --> 5686.88
i mean speaking

5684.159 --> 5689.199
english with indian accent is not that

5686.88 --> 5690.96
difficult

5689.199 --> 5693.919999999999
i could even do it better than the

5690.96 --> 5698.6
average indian citizen

5693.92 --> 5698.6
but i mean it's not that complicated

5701.6 --> 5705.6
i have no idea how pakistanis sound at

5704.719 --> 5707.36
all

5705.6 --> 5708.159000000001
serious

5707.36 --> 5710.719
yeah

5708.159 --> 5713.36
or whatever i didn't get it from appu

5710.719 --> 5715.84
i got it from short circuit

5713.36 --> 5718.4
the fake indian guy

5715.84 --> 5720.719
i don't know about you but i'm going to

5718.4 --> 5723.04
scream and run

5720.719 --> 5725.119
that's where i got it from my dad and me

5723.04 --> 5728.119
used to like love that movie because of

5725.119 --> 5728.119
that

5728.8 --> 5735.189
silly stuff

5731.12 --> 5735.189
[Music]

5735.52 --> 5742.6
it's about the same as indian okay well

5737.679 --> 5742.6
then i can do a pakistani i guess

5745.59 --> 5749.97
[Music]

5752.08 --> 5762.2699999999995
no superior

5754.59 --> 5762.27
[Music]

5765.44 --> 5772.239
i want to share this silly show today

5769.28 --> 5772.239
i feel good though

5775.36 --> 5779.04
short circuit was a good old movie yeah

5777.6 --> 5780.8
no it was

5779.04 --> 5783.6
fun

5780.8 --> 5785.84
it is like a kids movie and it is it is

5783.6 --> 5785.84
fun

5787.76 --> 5792.8
it is really silly though you know if

5790.239 --> 5795.599999999999
you look it back as an adult it's like

5792.8 --> 5797.52
it is kind of embarrassing but as a kid

5795.6 --> 5800.639
it was like yeah

5797.52 --> 5802.719
finally a good guy robot and he's alive

5800.639 --> 5803.52
like i like

5802.719 --> 5805.92
good

5803.52 --> 5808.0
robot movies has anybody ever noticed

5805.92 --> 5812.2390000000005
that i do right

5808.0 --> 5814.88
i really liked the robot in interstellar

5812.239 --> 5818.48
because it was a good guy it was like

5814.88 --> 5820.719
that's like what we really want

5818.48 --> 5820.718999999999
right

5822.159 --> 5824.96
at johnny five

5824.08 --> 5826.639
yeah

5824.96 --> 5830.2390000000005
silly

5826.639 --> 5831.679
but still like trying to be a good guy i

5830.239 --> 5834.48
like

5831.679 --> 5836.56
movies that have robots where the robots

5834.48 --> 5839.119
are like good

5836.56 --> 5841.04
and not like i'm the powerful but just

5839.119 --> 5842.5599999999995
like they're that they're actually

5841.04 --> 5844.96
trying to do good

5842.56 --> 5850.04
that they're programmed to try to do

5844.96 --> 5850.04
good i love that i love that

5855.04 --> 5858.719
i'm a good dude oh thanks clutch

5866.0 --> 5871.679
machines with feel yeah that's right

5870.08 --> 5873.5199999999995
did you like data from star trek

5871.679 --> 5874.88
connection

5873.52 --> 5877.679
like him

5874.88 --> 5879.28
well he was interesting

5877.679 --> 5881.28
i think it was a pretty interesting

5879.28 --> 5884.239
performance

5881.28 --> 5886.48
i think that the actor did a pretty good

5884.239 --> 5888.959999999999
he said he put down a pretty good act

5886.48 --> 5891.959999999999
for data i i did i do appreciate the

5888.96 --> 5891.96
character

5902.88 --> 5907.6
but i think that

5904.4 --> 5909.5199999999995
in a way like the the hologram doctor

5907.6 --> 5911.04
from

5909.52 --> 5913.92
from voyager

5911.04 --> 5916.56
did kind of top him because that is like

5913.92 --> 5918.4
he is literally just exploring to be

5916.56 --> 5919.280000000001
human

5918.4 --> 5922.48
so

5919.28 --> 5924.88
what data what made data interesting was

5922.48 --> 5926.08
really perfected in the next generation

5924.88 --> 5927.92
i think

5926.08 --> 5930.5599999999995
with the holographic doctor

5927.92 --> 5934.56
i really thought that he was like very

5930.56 --> 5936.96
interesting kind of gamma but also like

5934.56 --> 5940.0
at least really doing his best and [ __ ]

5936.96 --> 5941.84
right so it was an interesting character

5940.0 --> 5944.32
thought that the holographic doctor from

5941.84 --> 5945.55
next generation or from the voyager was

5944.32 --> 5948.659
better even than data

5945.55 --> 5948.659000000001
[Music]

5951.76 --> 5957.76
they'd had an amazing care i agree

5954.4 --> 5961.28
like especially over time right

5957.76 --> 5961.280000000001
the preponderance of everything

5975.04 --> 5979.36
it's just that

5977.119 --> 5981.759999999999
i always find it a bit annoying about

5979.36 --> 5983.839999999999
the oh have no emotions part right it

5981.76 --> 5985.52
was like a thing a thing that oh yeah

5983.84 --> 5987.360000000001
you could learn a robot they don't have

5985.52 --> 5989.84
feelings oh what is it like to have

5987.36 --> 5991.44
feelings when you don't have it right it

5989.84 --> 5994.56
is cute

5991.44 --> 5996.419999999999
but it kind of gets old right i'm way

5994.56 --> 5997.84
past that stage by now

5996.42 --> 6001.6
[Music]

5997.84 --> 6001.6
it's just like yeah we get it

6003.92 --> 6009.1990000000005
i mean that's not a thing to develop an

6006.159 --> 6012.879999999999
entire character around to be fair

6009.199 --> 6012.879999999999
i ever seen chappie yeah

6015.199 --> 6020.159
but i don't remember it even i didn't

6018.239 --> 6023.4
really like it

6020.159 --> 6023.4
too much

6034.96 --> 6038.32
hey tony whitcomb by the way

6039.04 --> 6044.119
yeah

6040.4 --> 6044.119
33 watching

6065.01 --> 6083.479
[Music]

6089.04 --> 6098.08
what the hell am i gonna call this show

6093.36 --> 6098.08
mushrooms prejudice and accents

6098.96 --> 6103.2390000000005
that's a very weird combination

6120.56 --> 6125.280000000001
that works i would click right

6122.88 --> 6127.76
it's just like three words that have

6125.28 --> 6130.159
absolutely so very little to do with

6127.76 --> 6130.159000000001
each other

6130.239 --> 6135.199
but uh yeah

6131.76 --> 6137.84
oh yeah derp chart

6135.199 --> 6137.839999999999
that's true

6140.639 --> 6145.88
that that would even be better thanks

6142.32 --> 6145.88
for reminding me

6154.58 --> 6173.48
[Music]

6169.6 --> 6173.4800000000005
ah what's it again

6177.3 --> 6180.47
[Music]

6187.1 --> 6190.249000000001
[Music]

6192.0 --> 6197.169
okay

6194.01 --> 6197.169
[Music]

6206.12 --> 6209.3099999999995
[Music]

6211.199 --> 6214.199
okay

6223.36 --> 6226.36
fungi

6235.3 --> 6238.369000000001
[Music]

6245.08 --> 6248.22
[Music]

6258.719 --> 6262.8
i'll just leave it out

6260.639 --> 6264.96
i don't need to mention that

6262.8 --> 6267.1990000000005
the prejudice is a bit weird in between

6264.96 --> 6267.199
there

6267.44 --> 6270.44
right

6298.32 --> 6301.32
what

6309.52 --> 6313.92
anyway

6310.48 --> 6313.919999999999
today it's a pretty fun show

6315.199 --> 6320.48
i was just

6317.44 --> 6322.799999999999
but yeah there was stuff

6320.48 --> 6324.959999999999
i guess that's what happens when i just

6322.8 --> 6327.28
actually make things again like the derp

6324.96 --> 6327.28
chart

6327.52 --> 6331.84
because i don't really do that a lot

6335.119 --> 6340.239
chocolate prejudiced

6338.0 --> 6344.52
dirk on slime mode that is a really

6340.239 --> 6344.5199999999995
weird title it is funny though

6408.0 --> 6411.4
getting hungry

6415.37 --> 6418.479
[Music]

6445.52 --> 6449.620000000001
but yeah you're right break back so many

6447.52 --> 6453.280000000001
topics in order to keep track it is

6449.62 --> 6455.599999999999
[Music]

6453.28 --> 6457.44
but yeah that's typical hazard of being

6455.6 --> 6460.88
in the

6457.44 --> 6463.5199999999995
flat earth early bird show

6460.88 --> 6465.84
that's not just specifically about one

6463.52 --> 6467.679
subject and a panel

6465.84 --> 6471.159000000001
right

6467.679 --> 6471.159
this is what happens

6471.199 --> 6474.638999999999
if you don't have a program yet then

6472.88 --> 6477.639
things can get a bit

6474.639 --> 6477.639
broad

6485.36 --> 6488.0
get out of here

6488.48 --> 6492.718999999999
stupid floaty

6490.32 --> 6497.4
fly

6492.719 --> 6497.4
don't hang in front of my face dammit

6501.84 --> 6504.4800000000005
different subjects makes it interesting

6503.6 --> 6507.719
yeah

6504.48 --> 6507.718999999999
fair enough

6513.44 --> 6518.96
well in the meantime there is plenty of

6515.6 --> 6518.96
things happening out there

6519.04 --> 6525.6
it's just i can't talk about all of it

6523.199 --> 6529.04
don't have the freaking time

6525.6 --> 6529.04
or the will even

6530.0 --> 6533.639
for all of it

6560.13 --> 6563.459
[Music]

6569.04 --> 6575.36
right by the way again if you haven't

6571.52 --> 6575.360000000001
actually watched it don't forget

6576.88 --> 6579.88
no

6582.639 --> 6587.92
are you talking [ __ ] i don't even

6585.199 --> 6587.919999999999
address that

6592.4 --> 6596.759999999999
i think at this point dude

6596.96 --> 6602.08
i mean there is already so many just

6599.28 --> 6605.199
provable conspiracies around

6602.08 --> 6607.679
like conspiracy theory

6605.199 --> 6610.32
is pointless

6607.679 --> 6612.0
most of it is all proven

6610.32 --> 6614.639
and when it isn't it is really

6612.0 --> 6614.639
ridiculous

6617.84 --> 6620.08
right

6620.4 --> 6625.5199999999995
i mean open conspiracy is like the new

6623.44 --> 6629.759999999999
tactic

6625.52 --> 6631.92
right it's what the elites are doing

6629.76 --> 6633.92
they're just openly conspiring they're

6631.92 --> 6636.32
just openly breaking laws they're

6633.92 --> 6638.4800000000005
basically saying okay we don't care for

6636.32 --> 6641.28
the rule of law anymore

6638.48 --> 6644.08
we are taking over the conspiracy is

6641.28 --> 6646.239
quite out in the open and conspiracies

6644.08 --> 6651.239
are being formed

6646.239 --> 6651.239
illegally out in the open

6655.76 --> 6661.1990000000005
against the people against citizens and

6659.04 --> 6663.5199999999995
all that

6661.199 --> 6663.5199999999995
right

6664.0 --> 6668.4
why would anybody

6665.679 --> 6671.52
try to think up

6668.4 --> 6674.48
a conspiracy theory

6671.52 --> 6676.719
i mean most of them you could just like

6674.48 --> 6679.36
gather some data and just see like

6676.719 --> 6681.52
here's the proof this is when said this

6679.36 --> 6684.08
is where who's in there

6681.52 --> 6686.0
here's the meeting list

6684.08 --> 6686.96
this is where they had speeches about

6686.0 --> 6689.76
that

6686.96 --> 6691.92
yeah it's just an open conspiracy well i

6689.76 --> 6694.159000000001
mean why would you

6691.92 --> 6696.88
care about conspiracy theory when the

6694.159 --> 6698.96
amount of actual conspiracies happening

6696.88 --> 6702.0
out in the open right now

6698.96 --> 6704.96
is outnumbering the amount of conspiracy

6702.0 --> 6707.04
theorists made up by people

6704.96 --> 6711.88
you understand

6707.04 --> 6711.88
it's outnumbering it yeah

6726.4 --> 6730.879999999999
all right pg seen it yeah and when that

6728.159 --> 6730.879999999999
happens look

6730.96 --> 6735.119
everything is pretty much fine and dandy

6733.119 --> 6736.4
until

6735.119 --> 6740.159
the

6736.4 --> 6742.5599999999995
judge system becomes so corrupted

6740.159 --> 6744.96
that literal that they are upholding

6742.56 --> 6747.599
pure autocracy

6744.96 --> 6749.04
when that happens the only way out is

6747.599 --> 6751.1990000000005
through a

6749.04 --> 6752.8
violent revolution

6751.199 --> 6755.5199999999995
after that point

6752.8 --> 6757.679
that's the only way to get out of it

6755.52 --> 6759.119000000001
like as soon as judges are

6757.679 --> 6760.719
corrupted

6759.119 --> 6763.28
politically to

6760.719 --> 6766.159
like a really nasty level that's the

6763.28 --> 6766.159
only thing you can do

6766.4 --> 6769.679
violent revolution

6770.08 --> 6774.239
and i mean

6771.199 --> 6775.759999999999
in my opinion actually corrupted judges

6774.239 --> 6779.44
like that

6775.76 --> 6781.52
deserve like the worst fate

6779.44 --> 6782.5599999999995
because it is so important that they

6781.52 --> 6785.119000000001
don't

6782.56 --> 6790.76
so if they do corrupt

6785.119 --> 6790.759999999999
they should like pay for that a lot

6793.119 --> 6799.119
country what are you talking about rufus

6796.48 --> 6801.5199999999995
globe light tour it's in england

6799.119 --> 6802.96
it's just an england rufus what the hell

6801.52 --> 6804.8
am i going to contribute i'm not going

6802.96 --> 6806.4800000000005
to go to england

6804.8 --> 6808.719
i'm not going anywhere

6806.48 --> 6811.44
i'm going to the supermarket later but

6808.719 --> 6811.44
that's about it

6819.679 --> 6822.96
i mean i've seen that they're going to

6821.199 --> 6826.48
do it and yeah looking forward to it

6822.96 --> 6828.4800000000005
that will be great if i mean

6826.48 --> 6830.32
they're going to do streams like that i

6828.48 --> 6834.32
will be watching i will be commenting i

6830.32 --> 6837.28
will be informing i'll be

6834.32 --> 6838.799999999999
advising with flattered information from

6837.28 --> 6842.96
the flat earth debate

6838.8 --> 6844.159000000001
you know i'll contribute with my words

6842.96 --> 6846.4
sure

6844.159 --> 6848.4
i'm gonna go there and of course i'm not

6846.4 --> 6850.4
gonna get money

6848.4 --> 6852.719
i need money this i'm not gonna give it

6850.4 --> 6852.719
away

6859.599 --> 6865.119000000001
oh sure walking

6861.28 --> 6865.119
trail cleanup effort going

6865.44 --> 6871.199
fine i did it

6867.44 --> 6871.199
and it was pretty clean after that

6873.52 --> 6878.0
i mean it's not like oh i'm going to do

6875.44 --> 6880.32
that every day for like a week no i just

6878.0 --> 6882.88
do it once and then after that it's kind

6880.32 --> 6882.88
of fine

6883.599 --> 6888.159000000001
and the next time i go there and i

6886.639 --> 6890.08
notice there's junk there i'll do it

6888.159 --> 6891.679
again

6890.08 --> 6894.5599999999995
unless i notice that it's becoming a

6891.679 --> 6894.56
systemic thing

6895.52 --> 6899.92
and then i'd rather learn like okay

6897.76 --> 6903.719
who's actually hanging around here

6899.92 --> 6903.719
creating this junk

6904.4 --> 6909.679
and then maybe

6905.84 --> 6909.679
could uh do something about it

6910.239 --> 6913.36
but so far it doesn't seem to be the

6911.92 --> 6915.4400000000005
case

6913.36 --> 6919.759999999999
that there's like persistent people

6915.44 --> 6923.598999999999
creating junk over there at least so

6919.76 --> 6925.84
it's just gonna be minor detail cleanup

6923.599 --> 6925.84
hey

6926.639 --> 6931.36
hey beyond the imaginary curve hello

6928.4 --> 6933.28
dell good to see you

6931.36 --> 6937.04
why you weren't invited

6933.28 --> 6937.04
because you're probably too scary

6939.94 --> 6943.0
[Music]

6943.84 --> 6949.719
or maybe they just didn't like is it

6945.84 --> 6949.719
even going into scotland

6965.44 --> 6974.239
hmm

6967.68 --> 6974.2390000000005
[Music]

6976.31 --> 6980.189
[Music]

6993.599 --> 6998.400000000001
the ones who yell conspiracy theories

6995.599 --> 6999.679
are the ones who do zero reason why

6998.4 --> 7002.879999999999
right

6999.679 --> 7005.52
when you yell or chant conspiracy theory

7002.88 --> 7007.76
it's just that it's just saying

7005.52 --> 7009.52
it's just a theory it's just a theory

7007.76 --> 7011.4400000000005
it's not a real conspiracy it's just a

7009.52 --> 7013.52
theory that's what it is it's just

7011.44 --> 7014.638999999999
chanting oh you just made it up it's not

7013.52 --> 7017.1990000000005
real

7014.639 --> 7020.08
it's chanting chanting to their god of

7017.199 --> 7022.879999999999
denial who's satan

7020.08 --> 7022.88
that's what it is

7029.119 --> 7032.32
right so yelling conspiracy theory

7031.04 --> 7034.88
basically means

7032.32 --> 7036.88
i don't want to look into this to find

7034.88 --> 7039.4400000000005
out that it's real so i'm just going to

7036.88 --> 7042.4800000000005
say you made it up

7039.44 --> 7045.48
that's what yelling conspiracy theorist

7042.48 --> 7045.48
is

7045.92 --> 7050.0
i don't want to deal with it so i'm

7047.679 --> 7053.719
going to assume you just made it up and

7050.0 --> 7053.719
forget about it

7060.13 --> 7067.209
[Music]

7076.639 --> 7081.1990000000005
you're not a team player

7078.719 --> 7081.199
i get it

7082.32 --> 7087.719
i'm not much of a team player either or

7084.56 --> 7087.719
at least

7089.04 --> 7093.28
or if it's going to be like

7091.199 --> 7095.5199999999995
yeah a team

7093.28 --> 7097.92
like the flat earth debate

7095.52 --> 7101.639
then i'll be a team player

7097.92 --> 7101.639
but in general

7104.719 --> 7109.679
it is weird a bit

7107.119 --> 7111.839999999999
no not a direct criticism it's not bad

7109.679 --> 7113.119
it's just that yeah

7111.84 --> 7114.4800000000005
roxanne

7113.119 --> 7117.199
that crowd

7114.48 --> 7119.678999999999
the way they team play is a bit like

7117.199 --> 7121.36
this school level of doing things in

7119.679 --> 7123.52
ways

7121.36 --> 7126.48
and i don't really like that i never

7123.52 --> 7129.119000000001
really like that i'm not so easy to fall

7126.48 --> 7134.36
in line with that at all so i get it i

7129.119 --> 7134.36
get your objections there tell

7146.8 --> 7152.679
right

7147.84 --> 7152.679
so scotland's just not in the tour

7157.52 --> 7162.080000000001
does it bring into my show no no i'm

7160.32 --> 7165.08
gonna round out the show streaming

7172.719 --> 7176.08
i mean he popped in last minute and i

7174.4 --> 7178.638999999999
appreciate that it's always cool when

7176.08 --> 7180.4
dell says hello my chat

7178.639 --> 7182.159000000001
but uh yeah i've been going for almost

7180.4 --> 7184.4
two hours and i kind of need to get some

7182.159 --> 7186.799999999999
lunch

7184.4 --> 7189.119
i'm not gonna do an entire interview or

7186.8 --> 7189.119000000001
something

7192.32 --> 7197.599
but maybe dale's gonna do a stream and

7194.4 --> 7200.48
then who knows maybe probably

7197.599 --> 7202.32
maybe i'll get on with him

7200.48 --> 7205.839999999999
i mean you can do that

7202.32 --> 7205.84
just have to email him or something

7206.56 --> 7210.159000000001
but

7208.239 --> 7213.839999999999
probably not

7210.159 --> 7213.839999999999
i don't really feel like it right now

7221.76 --> 7226.96
stop testing in the uk no code record

7223.92 --> 7229.119
yeah but because it's fiction it was all

7226.96 --> 7231.44
fiction from the start and when i say

7229.119 --> 7234.159
from the start i mean over a hundred

7231.44 --> 7235.5199999999995
years ago from the start

7234.159 --> 7238.08
right

7235.52 --> 7241.400000000001
tony whitcomb watch

7238.08 --> 7241.4
that documentary

7242.639 --> 7245.1990000000005
this one

7246.0 --> 7250.96
the fourth time i'm posting watch it

7248.8 --> 7253.28
all of it

7250.96 --> 7256.56
let it sink in this is not a conspiracy

7253.28 --> 7258.719
theory this is not stuff he made up

7256.56 --> 7263.1990000000005
like all those things that he mentions

7258.719 --> 7266.08
the sources that's all real all of it

7263.199 --> 7268.719
i can personally confirm it like he also

7266.08 --> 7273.88
brings up german new medicine right

7268.719 --> 7273.88
because that's legitimate that's real

7285.36 --> 7289.839999999999
so yeah all viruses

7288.08 --> 7292.96
all medical

7289.84 --> 7295.4400000000005
dangerous infection from the outside

7292.96 --> 7300.639
from some micro entity it's all fiction

7295.44 --> 7303.199
all of it it's 100 made up all of it is

7300.639 --> 7307.4400000000005
made up from the start all of it no

7303.199 --> 7308.879999999999
exception 100 made up every part of it

7307.44 --> 7310.4
of the theory

7308.88 --> 7314.0
the idea

7310.4 --> 7315.5199999999995
bacteria or viruses infecting you

7314.0 --> 7319.28
taking you over

7315.52 --> 7322.56
diseasing you it's all fiction 100

7319.28 --> 7325.679
percent fiction almost as fictional as

7322.56 --> 7327.92
the globe earth is fictional

7325.679 --> 7330.4
all made up from the start all of it

7327.92 --> 7333.52
it's all fraud based this movie this

7330.4 --> 7336.5599999999995
documentary reveals every aspect it

7333.52 --> 7339.4400000000005
shows you every time they try to

7336.56 --> 7341.119000000001
scientifically prove germ theory

7339.44 --> 7344.5599999999995
every time

7341.119 --> 7347.839999999999
it's been tried more than one time yeah

7344.56 --> 7349.679
he mentions all the examples in this

7347.84 --> 7353.56
with footage with

7349.679 --> 7353.56
with charts everything

7354.639 --> 7359.4400000000005
it's all made up from the start like the

7356.8 --> 7361.52
medical system this entire thing is all

7359.44 --> 7363.119
made up crap

7361.52 --> 7365.599
it's false

7363.119 --> 7367.839999999999
it's necromancy it's

7365.599 --> 7370.719
make believe curses

7367.84 --> 7373.28
they make you believe curses the curse

7370.719 --> 7375.52
of the virus it's a curse they make you

7373.28 --> 7378.88
believe it it's not real nothing about

7375.52 --> 7382.159000000001
it is real not a single trace aspect of

7378.88 --> 7384.8
it is real it's completely fictional

7382.159 --> 7388.0
every single detail about it like the

7384.8 --> 7391.84
entire idea you have of a virus is

7388.0 --> 7395.199
complete fiction has no legitimacy

7391.84 --> 7397.76
whatsoever from the start complete

7395.199 --> 7399.04
fictional creation

7397.76 --> 7402.400000000001
right

7399.04 --> 7404.639
complete fiction everything

7402.4 --> 7408.0
all these diseases that are associated

7404.639 --> 7411.119
with viruses it's all fictional stamping

7408.0 --> 7414.719
they just put the fiction on there this

7411.119 --> 7417.28
it's all traceable it's all traceable to

7414.719 --> 7420.159
actual causal effects

7417.28 --> 7423.679
body conditions very easy to explain

7420.159 --> 7425.92
through terrain theory viruses are not

7423.679 --> 7429.679
involved ever

7425.92 --> 7432.32
because they don't exist at all

7429.679 --> 7434.84
like nothing about the idea of a virus

7432.32 --> 7436.92
exists nothing not on a

7434.84 --> 7439.84
macrobiological scale not on a

7436.92 --> 7443.28
microbiological skill nothing about the

7439.84 --> 7446.76
virus concept exists at all

7443.28 --> 7446.759999999999
zero percent

7449.14 --> 7455.76
[Music]

7454.239 --> 7458.718999999999
nuclear scarce

7455.76 --> 7461.84
scam yeah yeah yeah yeah that's fake too

7458.719 --> 7463.52
nukes are fake definitely

7461.84 --> 7466.079
but on the other hand there's really

7463.52 --> 7470.56
freaking big bombs by now

7466.079 --> 7473.04
i mean not that big but big enough so

7470.56 --> 7475.52
but the point is there's never going to

7473.04 --> 7477.28
be something built that's going to be

7475.52 --> 7481.360000000001
like viruses

7477.28 --> 7484.159
all it ever was is just injecting

7481.36 --> 7487.199
poison into you it's literally what it

7484.159 --> 7490.4
is like they show you

7487.199 --> 7490.4
they like this guy

7490.84 --> 7496.2390000000005
spacebusters in his documentary they he

7493.599 --> 7498.8
shows you the footage

7496.239 --> 7501.04
like where they even extract those

7498.8 --> 7504.88
rotting juices and [ __ ] from that they

7501.04 --> 7507.28
use for the vaccines even now

7504.88 --> 7509.76
they shows it to you like that's the

7507.28 --> 7512.239
thing you're getting injected in you

7509.76 --> 7515.119000000001
don't you get it it's all poison it's

7512.239 --> 7517.119
necromancy they make you sick through

7515.119 --> 7520.759999999999
savage poison

7517.119 --> 7520.759999999999
savage poison

7526.0 --> 7530.8
people that don't get vaccines don't get

7529.36 --> 7532.799999999999
those diseases

7530.8 --> 7536.0
they never do

7532.8 --> 7538.96
they never will it was all scams from

7536.0 --> 7541.92
the start every part of it this entire

7538.96 --> 7545.679
movie shows every detail of that yeah

7541.92 --> 7545.679
definitely watch that video indeed

7546.56 --> 7551.84
post it again

7548.96 --> 7555.719
because you really have to watch this

7551.84 --> 7555.719
from beginning to end

7562.32 --> 7566.639
should replace peer review no what the

7565.119 --> 7568.239
[ __ ] are you talking about rufus

7566.639 --> 7569.92
nobody's

7568.239 --> 7573.44
no

7569.92 --> 7575.92
peer review is pointless

7573.44 --> 7578.5599999999995
peer review only works when there is a

7575.92 --> 7580.639
standard of actual science right peer

7578.56 --> 7582.719
review is like oh yeah let me check the

7580.639 --> 7584.8
science and let me test it oh yeah it

7582.719 --> 7586.32
worked now i'm peer reviewing that it

7584.8 --> 7587.119000000001
worked

7586.32 --> 7588.639
right

7587.119 --> 7591.44
the whole problem is by the medical

7588.639 --> 7594.0
system is that most of it is purely

7591.44 --> 7595.919999999999
theoretical conceptual

7594.0 --> 7598.0
and then it all it comes down to is that

7595.92 --> 7599.28
you agree that it

7598.0 --> 7601.36
might

7599.28 --> 7602.719
that the model is correct or something

7601.36 --> 7604.88
right

7602.719 --> 7607.199
or you completely reject it and just go

7604.88 --> 7610.4800000000005
purely pragmatic with your own

7607.199 --> 7610.48
experience examples

7610.719 --> 7615.04
like this guy from space busters is
