it's Tuesday Mountain Dew and chicken

184.47 --> 197.609
salad three be right uh I went to bed

195.84 --> 201.959
very early again yesterday so I'm

197.609 --> 203.669
keeping this up and they didn't need

201.959 --> 208.31900000000002
that because I don't know yesterday I

203.669 --> 209.90900000000002
was kind of tired still feel tired again

208.319 --> 217.31
though I don't know what this is maybe

209.909 --> 221.269
this is just slight fatigue or something

217.31 --> 224.9
because of yeah what I'm just constantly

221.269 --> 224.9
keeping up as it were

226.53 --> 230.88
I'm just starting to notice certain

229.14 --> 237.6
patterns more and more and more and I'm

230.88 --> 239.67
getting kind of I don't know I feel it's

237.6 --> 242.57999999999998
so hard to describe I'm getting kind of

239.67 --> 247.26
restless in a way but still having good

242.58 --> 251.04000000000002
times though yeah I was in the 24/7

247.26 --> 253.73999999999998
discord up to an hour ago pretty long

251.04 --> 258.989
long long conversations talked about

253.74 --> 261.77
water filters a lot over there and yeah

258.989 --> 264.47999999999996
this went into all kinds of things and

261.77 --> 275.88
it did bring up certain type of things

264.48 --> 280.29
that I just don't want to know about and

275.88 --> 282.03
that's when yeah since I was there been

280.29 --> 287.21000000000004
kind of in the backdrop and I'm just

282.03 --> 287.21
looking at it again and like that ie I

287.66 --> 298.74
don't have a place to put it anyway

294.3 --> 300.75
thank you good servant for the 111 super

298.74 --> 307.95
chat donation much appreciated

300.75 --> 311.33
a sleeping warrior I said it a Cosentino

307.95 --> 311.33
hey neo how you doing

335.27 --> 345.28999999999996
right Oh something I guess I've been

342.18 --> 349.47
considering on top of it all is that

345.29 --> 354.18
there are so many video oh I'm trying to

349.47 --> 360.90000000000003
pay the fee which V is that good servant

354.18 --> 364.44
anyway it's like a lot of the times I'm

360.9 --> 366.47999999999996
being confronted with yeah in the social

364.44 --> 368.85
landscape and effective on YouTube like

366.48 --> 372.81
what are you what do you do what are you

368.85 --> 374.61
doing like what are you good at what is

372.81 --> 378.15
a person typically doing or their

374.61 --> 381.39
conversation list are they a researcher

378.15 --> 383.58
and reporter are they good at making

381.39 --> 388.01
videos are they good at memeing it like

383.58 --> 391.77
and yeah people find their talents and

388.01 --> 394.2
then kind of naturally out of that forms

391.77 --> 397.44
of program of what they're doing and how

394.2 --> 401.4
they do it and what they get known for

397.44 --> 404.25
and all that it's I'm having a bit of

401.4 --> 409.32
trouble with that for myself but it's

404.25 --> 411.75
also because I'm mostly an analyzer

409.32 --> 413.55
that's really where my talents lie but

411.75 --> 415.38
there's like this weird problem that's

413.55 --> 420.05
starting and sort of a feedback loop

415.38 --> 423.75
almost in my system and that's I don't

420.05 --> 427.8
tend to like absorb and memorize a lot

423.75 --> 432.96
of details I go by feel a lot but

427.8 --> 435.78000000000003
because of that I pick up this I'm

432.96 --> 438.98999999999995
basically reading into another part of

435.78 --> 441.51
the band of information the entire

438.99 --> 443.82
spectrum of it all and I'm picking up

441.51 --> 447.59999999999997
whole different things as people that

443.82 --> 450.09
typically do memorize and dig into very

447.6 --> 454.02000000000004
specific subjects and then specialize to

450.09 --> 456.53
the utmost and another thing there's a

454.02 --> 456.53
lot of

457.75 --> 465.79
to split up in this method of approach

461.49 --> 467.74
and I'm noticing just certain types of

465.79 --> 470.98
patterns are coming out of it that I see

467.74 --> 473.05
and the people that they do when they do

470.98 --> 475.03000000000003
it themselves don't really get to see

473.05 --> 477.94
because that's just not really possible

475.03 --> 482.73999999999995
because of what they're doing how they

477.94 --> 484.45
do it and it's all still good but I'm

482.74 --> 489.19
starting to noticing more and more and

484.45 --> 492.84
it's getting pretty overwhelming at

489.19 --> 495.61
times synchronize synchronicities right

492.84 --> 497.95
people do know the synchronicities and a

495.61 --> 501.79
lot of things and just like watch back

497.95 --> 504.55
any type of video and you'll start to

501.79 --> 508.24
see weird synchronicities people catch

504.55 --> 513.07
themselves in yes incra Nissa tees and

508.24 --> 516.96
videos when they yeah it's very unlikely

513.07 --> 519.6690000000001
they have that on their mind at the time

516.96 --> 524.6500000000001
right so there's just these patterns in

519.669 --> 527.53
the information and it's like it's

524.65 --> 530.7099999999999
getting freaky in the sense that

527.53 --> 533.26
sometimes it feels like there is barely

530.71 --> 537.7900000000001
really any separate information it's

533.26 --> 539.71
almost like it's all tied in it's I'm

537.79 --> 542.7099999999999
working so much in tuning in to

539.71 --> 546.07
frequencies which is kind of the

542.71 --> 548.95
opposite of specified information it's

546.07 --> 551.6800000000001
everything about the feel it's so

548.95 --> 554.73
complex to explain really to to the

551.68 --> 557.17
detail you can only give analogies feel

554.73 --> 561.0600000000001
comparisons sometimes music you know

557.17 --> 561.06
that it's like in another region and

561.39 --> 564.39
because

564.67 --> 569.5899999999999
all the patterns just always come back

567.16 --> 572.62
everything it's like it's all one thing

569.59 --> 574.48
and yeah and that feeds back into well

572.62 --> 577.69
one of my first conceptions when I was

574.48 --> 580.54
once it's 16 of 17 and like everything

577.69 --> 583.45
is one giant pattern like everything

580.54 --> 589.03
there's no information no thing in

583.45 --> 592.0300000000001
existence no form that's not part of

589.03 --> 596.55
this singular pattern but that's a

592.03 --> 602.52
concepts like a conceptual extrapolation

596.55 --> 607.8399999999999
and I'm starting to just see that again

602.52 --> 610.42
more but instead of a very distant look

607.84 --> 611.98
as I had when it was younger and just

610.42 --> 614.3499999999999
saw it like way in the distance like

611.98 --> 619.24
well yeah ideas really must be connected

614.35 --> 624.6
it is connected now I wasn't looking

619.24 --> 628.39
that far but just by looking I'm seeing

624.6 --> 631.12
like that pattern yeah I'm seeing like

628.39 --> 637.18
results of that thought experiment kind

631.12 --> 639.67
of manifesting in front of me it's kind

637.18 --> 645.04
of heavy experience sometimes but it

639.67 --> 647.91
makes me a little detached so like I

645.04 --> 650.23
almost thought at first like wow this is

647.91 --> 652.2099999999999
the way I respond to it's almost like a

650.23 --> 655.29
depression but it's not really a

652.21 --> 655.2900000000001
depression it's

660.98 --> 667.3000000000001
is it's like a switch but

668.19 --> 676.1600000000001
it's due to grip and yeah grip always

672.45 --> 678.7800000000001
has a very direct influence on social

676.16 --> 680.55
entanglements with others like the

678.78 --> 682.4399999999999
attitude the comparisons always

680.55 --> 684.8399999999999
comparing you know at the preponderance

682.44 --> 688.5
of somebody's spirit that that naturally

684.84 --> 691.19
happens so what jealousy and competition

688.5 --> 693.87
feelings come from and all that and how

691.19 --> 698.3100000000001
near each other's frequency they are and

693.87 --> 701.07
all that yeah but just seeing it so

698.31 --> 709.17
vividly kind of makes me feel like I'm

701.07 --> 713.1600000000001
not part of everyone else anymore even

709.17 --> 716.49
though I kind of want to be but it's

713.16 --> 718.62
like from the inside I want to be but

716.49 --> 723.47
from what's coming from the outside I

718.62 --> 723.47
seem to want to retract even more

723.77 --> 729.96
because of what I'm seeing and what

726.48 --> 733.0500000000001
people are getting used to the the slope

729.96 --> 737.25
the unseen slope they can't see that

733.05 --> 739.74
they're slipping very slowly they they

737.25 --> 742.56
can't see it coming all of them most of

739.74 --> 746.55
them like can even predict it but they

742.56 --> 748.89
can how many people can analyse it for

746.55 --> 751.9799999999999
themselves like yeah in the last ten

748.89 --> 753.78
years I had these in this attitude in

751.98 --> 755.49
these principles based on these and

753.78 --> 757.9499999999999
these ideas and what was going around

755.49 --> 760.5
and I've held this and was very strongly

757.95 --> 763.8900000000001
against that and that and are 10 years

760.5 --> 765.66
later is like with everything new and

763.89 --> 771.0889999999999
all the new perspective and the throwing

765.66 --> 775.35
around like are you still there

771.089 --> 778.44
or like stricter or more refined or have

775.35 --> 780.839
you kind of with everybody else

778.44 --> 783.87
gradually gradually slipped and now

780.839 --> 788.61
everybody's changed like that so you

783.87 --> 791.7
can't really see it that well are you

788.61 --> 794.4300000000001
noticing any of that this is a question

791.7 --> 799.49
to everybody watching and especially in

794.43 --> 799.4899999999999
my chat because

804.649 --> 812.42
like in a way I'm kind of fearful that

807.92 --> 817.069
I'm slipping - even though I'm like

812.42 --> 819.829
almost maniacally trying not to go in a

817.069 --> 825.5889999999999
way and letting other things completely

819.829 --> 833.689
slip as a controlled act as a controlled

825.589 --> 841.5790000000001
deed kind of - so terribly control the

833.689 --> 843.829
opposition it's complex but is anybody

841.579 --> 846.29
else experienced any any of this or am I

843.829 --> 848.9899999999999
just now blabbering on about my inner

846.29 --> 856.2199999999999
workings and everybody's like well I

848.99 --> 858.92
don't know anymore a man sometimes maybe

856.22 --> 861.249
I'm having a introspective moment or

858.92 --> 861.2489999999999
something

869.48 --> 878.58
soteriological letter I don't know what

872.4 --> 882.54
that is I don't recognize that word and

878.58 --> 889.26
unless you meant to put an e in front of

882.54 --> 893.61
that an esoteric o RS esotery o logical

889.26 --> 897.6899999999999
and then I don't know now it's not

893.61 --> 902.61
really depression though it's depression

897.69 --> 907.4000000000001
is when you're stuck and you're just

902.61 --> 914.76
gonna try to do whatever to get unstuck

907.4 --> 916.47
but I'm technically not stuck and I

914.76 --> 918.95
definitely want to keep all of this

916.47 --> 918.95
going

924.4 --> 933.5799999999999
it stuck maybe maybe an impasse would be

930.79 --> 939.8199999999999
more but it's like in kind and run in

933.58 --> 942.1600000000001
this corner and the problem is it feels

939.82 --> 944.38
like I've run in this corner even though

942.16 --> 946.0899999999999
it probably will turn out that it was in

944.38 --> 949.09
the corner in the first place kind of

946.09 --> 954.0300000000001
situation that makes any sense steer

949.09 --> 954.0300000000001
what I'm meaning trying to explain

968.06 --> 977.279
well study that Neal I have every CD the

973.8 --> 979.3199999999999
police ever brought out I'm pretty sure

977.279 --> 982.83
I've heard that song although the name

979.32 --> 987.99
it itself doesn't ring I'm not tying

982.83 --> 990.95
that name to a song memory in this case

987.99 --> 990.95
right now

1002.05 --> 1007.63
synchronicity two was dead it's not

1005.089 --> 1007.6300000000001
ringing a bell

1015.88 --> 1045.309
the final album you know what I can look

1020.709 --> 1046.48
it up and I have the city so well maybe

1045.309 --> 1052.32
I don't have more

1046.48 --> 1059.46
maybe I just have two ones that matter I

1052.32 --> 1059.46
got three CDs

1061.48 --> 1069.92
yeah I might not be in possession of

1065.39 --> 1081.0200000000002
another one that came after because I

1069.92 --> 1083.5700000000002
just got these three this leads to my

1081.02 --> 1084.19
mother used to have them on record lay

1083.57 --> 1096.7
those

1084.19 --> 1096.7
[Music]

1102.52 --> 1105.52
okay

1106.01 --> 1110.47
[Music]

1111.78 --> 1124.71
don't worry about me you have a I'm just

1115.15 --> 1124.71
fine I got

1125.48 --> 1128.23
okay

1129.53 --> 1132.16
huh

1137.86 --> 1142.9289999999999
all right maybe I should look them up

1139.929 --> 1146.38
sometimes there's probably some defined

1142.929 --> 1151.2
on YouTube I don't know why I think I

1146.38 --> 1151.2
was just interested in the old style

1151.44 --> 1157.3600000000001
could be because yeah I've also heard

1154.6 --> 1160.51
sting and everything and came from that

1157.36 --> 1166.35
ban pretty much after that and it's just

1160.51 --> 1166.35
I really like the old style

1173.02 --> 1181.2
okay thanks for the the input sorry

1178.15 --> 1181.2
sorry de gasolina

1186.11 --> 1189.53
[Music]

1199.419 --> 1203.909
oh no no Adam

1222.78 --> 1227.87
I don't know why that seems to be such a

1225.48 --> 1227.8700000000001
thing

1267.28 --> 1270.12
hmm

1277.539 --> 1284.2
so blah Missouri bear maybe have kind of

1281.769 --> 1294.549
a big statement they're all modern music

1284.2 --> 1297.749
is it created situations but that's for

1294.549 --> 1302.039
manipulating population or music

1297.749 --> 1305.71
especially pop music's was always very

1302.039 --> 1311.799
with just almost openly knowingly used

1305.71 --> 1313.539
to do that like yeah song if it happens

1311.799 --> 1315.94
to be something that everybody's talking

1313.539 --> 1319.749
about and really agrees with then such a

1315.94 --> 1321.8200000000002
song is welcomed so there is like a the

1319.749 --> 1323.619
feeling in the direction the highlight

1321.82 --> 1327.489
of a situation that's talked about

1323.619 --> 1330.4889999999998
that's the music surrounds and then

1327.489 --> 1333.3400000000001
there is the context of it all in what

1330.489 --> 1335.32
has happened in reflection of actual

1333.34 --> 1340.809
situations in the real world and this of

1335.32 --> 1343.049
course changes over time so yeah it's a

1340.809 --> 1345.549
little bit more complicated than just

1343.049 --> 1352.9189999999999
the music is there to manipulate

1345.549 --> 1352.9189999999999
everyone it just it's an influencer

1370.45 --> 1375.1200000000001
I don't care

1393.81 --> 1400.32
don't buy it please it's complete

1399.58 --> 1402.55
nonsense

1400.32 --> 1405.6
everybody's talked about it at the

1402.55 --> 1410.29
beginning like half of everyone saw

1405.6 --> 1413.9499999999998
something about it coming like look I

1410.29 --> 1419.23
lay down the whole viruses aren't

1413.95 --> 1422.92
actually what it said to be like way way

1419.23 --> 1425.04
before any of the bigger doctors came

1422.92 --> 1427.3000000000002
out and all that and the better videos

1425.04 --> 1429.25
so yeah I could brag about that but

1427.3 --> 1431.08
that's because yeah I'm connected to

1429.25 --> 1433.27
somebody and people and a group of

1431.08 --> 1437.85
researchers that have been onto that for

1433.27 --> 1441.79
a very very long time so I had

1437.85 --> 1443.53
first-hand dibs in that that was

1441.79 --> 1445.54
something that I could address and it

1443.53 --> 1447.85
was very afraid at first because I

1445.54 --> 1451.42
thought oh my god is this too far

1447.85 --> 1453.37
is that too far because I was afraid

1451.42 --> 1456.16
that I would be persecuted or something

1453.37 --> 1459.2199999999998
because nobody else was talking about it

1456.16 --> 1462.88
like that yet and then guess what within

1459.22 --> 1465.1000000000001
just a week or something all of these

1462.88 --> 1466.8700000000001
things came out that went into the same

1465.1 --> 1468.49
direction tried to describe the same

1466.87 --> 1472.03
thing about viruses not being what they

1468.49 --> 1476.11
are and then now an entire alternative

1472.03 --> 1478.18
models are being presented probably

1476.11 --> 1479.8
created by people in response to the

1478.18 --> 1482.05
realization it was false in the first

1479.8 --> 1486.46
place doing their own separate model

1482.05 --> 1491.31
research with that and yeah it's like

1486.46 --> 1494.14
yeah of course you know but don't forget

1491.31 --> 1497.5
her when he threw that out there just

1494.14 --> 1504.0400000000002
like that nobody's even heard of that

1497.5 --> 1507.82
before and I take full credit and I just

1504.04 --> 1511.42
relayed and how I own that credit and

1507.82 --> 1513.34
that's it it's really not that much of a

1511.42 --> 1517.93
deal really just this is how the world

1513.34 --> 1523.1689999999999
works if you got connections early on

1517.93 --> 1536.289
you can yeah bring things forth and

1523.169 --> 1539.26
yeah well yeah because knowledge big

1536.289 --> 1543.419
knowledge especially control knowledge

1539.26 --> 1547.0
is all about just realizing that

1543.419 --> 1550.24
everybody has a certain level of how

1547.0 --> 1553.57
much they are tapped out of reality by

1550.24 --> 1556.78
accident it's statistical average and

1553.57 --> 1560.4089999999999
when you realize that then you can just

1556.78 --> 1564.7
say like okay this is not gonna rub

1560.409 --> 1567.73
right now in this day and age things are

1564.7 --> 1571.75
very politicized you know so extreme

1567.73 --> 1574.929
opinion and contrary opinion seem to get

1571.75 --> 1576.82
in there more easily situations more

1574.929 --> 1581.679
spiritually inflamed you could consider

1576.82 --> 1586.5
to say that but yeah if something is

1581.679 --> 1589.0300000000002
just completely not embraced in any way

1586.5 --> 1591.82
then yeah you could throw something out

1589.03 --> 1595.12
that just it won't rub off I thought

1591.82 --> 1598.84
that it wasn't gonna rub off at all but

1595.12 --> 1602.4399999999998
yeah I was wrong it did rub off not

1598.84 --> 1605.9499999999998
saying that it was me I just didn't

1602.44 --> 1610.3300000000002
expect that it would really get as much

1605.95 --> 1612.669
out in the open as it was going to so

1610.33 --> 1614.9189999999999
add that I'm kind of like wow man I

1612.669 --> 1618.97
can't believe it it's so much out there

1614.919 --> 1622.0900000000001
now I did not expect that to happen to

1618.97 --> 1624.58
that level that quickly I thought it was

1622.09 --> 1628.87
going to be a much longer term much more

1624.58 --> 1632.8899999999999
long term process but the inside of what

1628.87 --> 1636.34
viruses really are it yeah it got there

1632.89 --> 1640.74
pretty quickly now it's a sub layer of

1636.34 --> 1640.74
information so

1641.619 --> 1652.6999999999998
yeah and that's how you use some kind of

1646.149 --> 1656.86
troll plug to bring forth the little

1652.7 --> 1656.8600000000001
item for yourself yeah

1669.16 --> 1684.52
many cases are solved with uploaded

1674.43 --> 1688.8700000000001
right yeah there there is just this

1684.52 --> 1690.52
other situation now kind of slowly being

1688.87 --> 1693.9899999999998
pushed forward but I've been very

1690.52 --> 1696.96
skeptical of it in a way because it

1693.99 --> 1701.29
that's this whole idea that really

1696.96 --> 1710.1000000000001
people are pushed to die like because of

1701.29 --> 1714.1599999999999
kovat dislike it's it's too crazy to be

1710.1 --> 1716.62
exactly like that you know but yeah when

1714.16 --> 1719.3500000000001
you get like detailed testimonies from

1716.62 --> 1722.1399999999999
several people that describe situations

1719.35 --> 1727.06
that you could definitely imagine to

1722.14 --> 1728.8000000000002
happen in some way then it becomes more

1727.06 --> 1732.31
clear that there's just this weird

1728.8 --> 1734.1399999999999
aberrant situation happening in the

1732.31 --> 1736.54
medical system in response to this

1734.14 --> 1741.0400000000002
covent it is like really odd and it's

1736.54 --> 1744.52
just I think that a lot of people just

1741.04 --> 1749.95
don't really in the system don't really

1744.52 --> 1754.36
know what to do with this like it's not

1749.95 --> 1763.56
as clear-cut as the medical system

1754.36 --> 1763.56
usually is rollout so there's just this

1765.1 --> 1778.1899999999998
it's a Pathak response in a way does

1772.639 --> 1782.2299999999998
that make any sense that because like

1778.19 --> 1786.74
yeah there's a lot of conspiracy the

1782.23 --> 1788.809
death panic people constantly think that

1786.74 --> 1792.529
everything is a murdering monster and

1788.809 --> 1794.539
all that yeah that like oh they're

1792.529 --> 1797.899
really killing them and it's like a

1794.539 --> 1800.929
murder project kind of idea and I think

1797.899 --> 1802.549
that's just ridiculous really and that

1800.929 --> 1807.8300000000002
does come on that doesn't make that

1802.549 --> 1813.11
that's not how things happen but it

1807.83 --> 1815.33
could be like a combination of situation

1813.11 --> 1818.84
and atmosphere and a respect and

1815.33 --> 1825.98
expected maybe a response where there's

1818.84 --> 1829.97
just this apathy because of trust in a

1825.98 --> 1832.6
way the ability to lean with trust on

1829.97 --> 1835.07
your system while at the same time

1832.6 --> 1836.539
focusing so much on your own skills and

1835.07 --> 1841.129
all that and how you'd and the rules

1836.539 --> 1846.679
that like distress is resulting in like

1841.129 --> 1851.509
accidental apathy maybe even sadism for

1846.679 --> 1853.49
some and but I think yeah ii really

1851.509 --> 1856.129
think that it is like a conspiracy to

1853.49 --> 1862.879
specifically get these people killed

1856.129 --> 1866.23
because of all these situations i think

1862.879 --> 1869.629
that that idea maybe a whole conspiracy

1866.23 --> 1872.269
operation just by itself now on the

1869.629 --> 1876.139
other hand yeah you know there's a lot

1872.269 --> 1881.029
of doctors and a lot of nurses in the

1876.139 --> 1883.7299999999998
big big world so yeah maybe some places

1881.029 --> 1886.789
that does actually happen like that and

1883.73 --> 1891.129
the doctors some doctors may be really

1886.789 --> 1894.919
freaks creeps like huge big-time

1891.129 --> 1896.62
disgusting grab lers yeah under cover of

1894.919 --> 1898.69
a doctor or something

1896.62 --> 1906.789
but that's definitely not going to be

1898.69 --> 1909.52
everything that's but it's being spread

1906.789 --> 1916.39
the stories are being spread almost as

1909.52 --> 1920.95
if that is the case and yeah I wonder if

1916.39 --> 1925.75
people realized like is that is that

1920.95 --> 1928.39
like productive in some kind of sensible

1925.75 --> 1930.94
way to to put it out there just like

1928.39 --> 1937.419
that like it's all specifically an act

1930.94 --> 1939.659
to do that or is it more wise to

1937.419 --> 1942.97
consider that it may be like an aberrant

1939.659 --> 1946.1200000000001
situation that is like an accident that

1942.97 --> 1948.6100000000001
this is happening like this it's not a

1946.12 --> 1956.08
planned intention from the people doing

1948.61 --> 1965.049
it I don't know I think it's worth

1956.08 --> 1967.4499999999998
considering at least but don't forget

1965.049 --> 1969.6399999999999
there may definitely be a couple of

1967.45 --> 1973.3300000000002
big-time grappler doctors out there as

1969.64 --> 1977.25
well that may have actually just

1973.33 --> 1981.1
creepily planned something like this out

1977.25 --> 1984.22
it's not going to be everything no way

1981.1 --> 1984.2199999999998
[Music]

1990.64 --> 1993.8390000000002
[Music]

1995.559 --> 2006.029
right but just also realize is that like

2001.499 --> 2009.83
all the doctors they've all like the

2006.029 --> 2012.269
virus idea and all the diseases

2009.83 --> 2016.32
supposedly that our viruses and all that

2012.269 --> 2023.85
it's all part of their medical lore and

2016.32 --> 2026.789
it's it's fast enough so because the way

2023.85 --> 2029.49
they are educated which is very

2026.789 --> 2031.35
elaborately it's very it's a lot of info

2029.49 --> 2036.6490000000001
that most people just can't even get in

2031.35 --> 2041.4599999999998
their heads it's very tough to then just

2036.649 --> 2043.4399999999998
say no all of this was all fake it's

2041.46 --> 2045.99
like a lie that I've been forced to

2043.44 --> 2056.849
learn that's a very tough process for a

2045.99 --> 2059.97
lot of people so they will simply hold

2056.849 --> 2063.089
on to the idea that the virus situation

2059.97 --> 2066.27
is real even though it's like either it

2063.089 --> 2068.25
doesn't make any sense how things are

2066.27 --> 2070.74
done and you're realizing like wow if

2068.25 --> 2072.78
viruses were real then none of this

2070.74 --> 2075.5989999999997
would really be effective and this is

2072.78 --> 2079.5890000000004
chaos so then there's that perspective

2075.599 --> 2082.589
or you just be like oh I just hope I

2079.589 --> 2086.73
won't get it and yeah be in the state of

2082.589 --> 2091.44
fear just doing whatever is said because

2086.73 --> 2093.569
it's more about calming your nerves but

2091.44 --> 2096.03
these are both perspectives that come

2093.569 --> 2099.48
forth from the base teachings that you

2096.03 --> 2102.329
believe viruses when it's going on or

2099.48 --> 2108.119
not are technically real see so it's

2102.329 --> 2110.849
it's very complex system that ties into

2108.119 --> 2116.52
how everybody is responding in the

2110.849 --> 2122.4
medical system it's like their own

2116.52 --> 2124.5
little flat earth versus the ball that's

2122.4 --> 2126.839
the majority of doctors you could

2124.5 --> 2129.06
compare it to that it's like some of the

2126.839 --> 2130.5299999999997
doctors are like this is crazy

2129.06 --> 2133.46
there if this flat and they're like what

2130.53 --> 2136.73
no way we've all been taught it's a ball

2133.46 --> 2138.9900000000002
so you're a danger you're a danger yeah

2136.73 --> 2140.28
that's even more logical to medical

2138.99 --> 2142.8599999999997
system to think anything in that

2140.28 --> 2147.6600000000003
direction so it's very comparable it's

2142.86 --> 2150.84
like the same responses are a risk that

2147.66 --> 2153.54
that could happen potentially it's just

2150.84 --> 2156.32
opposed a block of knowledge like that

2153.54 --> 2159.32
that's literally being utilized as a

2156.32 --> 2159.32
policy

2181.58 --> 2188.56
[Music]

2191.12 --> 2199.22
that's right secret Asian man that's

2193.68 --> 2203.22
correct but a perceived threat does have

2199.22 --> 2206.0699999999997
yeah abilities to allow government to do

2203.22 --> 2208.5299999999997
things and that's kind of what this is

2206.07 --> 2213.23
all riding on is the perceived threat of

2208.53 --> 2217.4300000000003
the corona its invisible enemy remember

2213.23 --> 2220.9
those words are picked very carefully

2217.43 --> 2223.959
because they have legal implications

2220.9 --> 2223.9590000000003
[Music]

2231.589 --> 2237.469
yeah it's all a complex game guys and

2236.029 --> 2239.93
you're all part of it

2237.469 --> 2242.359
you're all in the middle of it it's up

2239.93 --> 2246.499
to you to figure out how the rules work

2242.359 --> 2248.72
and how things are done and what can be

2246.499 --> 2251.7799999999997
done

2248.72 --> 2251.7799999999997
[Music]

2269.349 --> 2276.88
all right Guns of Navarone RFP yeah

2272.079 --> 2279.7290000000003
that's definitely out there the corona

2276.88 --> 2284.469
tagging of dead yep

2279.729 --> 2286.18
and well that's even that's halfway

2284.469 --> 2288.94
making it through to the mainstream

2286.18 --> 2290.8289999999997
almost well I'm not the worst sources

2288.94 --> 2293.739
but it's like that's really getting out

2290.829 --> 2295.779
there that realization that that's just

2293.739 --> 2299.559
happening it's being it's all the talk

2295.779 --> 2304.949
of the day it's a lot of yeah you know

2299.559 --> 2309.759
how that works but what was my point

2304.949 --> 2312.13
right the thing is about it the people

2309.759 --> 2316.809
that do it don't do it because they

2312.13 --> 2320.259
wanna fake Corona deaths probably they

2316.809 --> 2322.8900000000003
wanna do it for some kind of financial

2320.259 --> 2327.369
reason probably it's like oh if we get

2322.89 --> 2329.469
enough marked up as this then we get a

2327.369 --> 2332.199
little bit more budget something like

2329.469 --> 2334.449
that it's it's really that basic so it's

2332.199 --> 2339.489
not even like they wanna falsified it's

2334.449 --> 2341.7690000000002
just that it's to that yeah they might

2339.489 --> 2344.469
even like be ordered like no you have to

2341.769 --> 2348.7589999999996
do that because the more the hospital

2344.469 --> 2351.789
really needs that money you know you

2348.759 --> 2356.14
don't know for sure exactly what the

2351.789 --> 2357.489
reason behind those taggings are can't

2356.14 --> 2360.009
just say no they're doing that

2357.489 --> 2362.799
specifically to hype up the fear of

2360.009 --> 2365.89
Kuroda no no no no that seems more in

2362.799 --> 2370.359
the the corner of media specifically to

2365.89 --> 2375.449
do that there are the ones that lay out

2370.359 --> 2375.449
these types of connections those ideas

2379.77 --> 2388.779
but yeah it is rich it is especially in

2385.119 --> 2391.569
this scenario in presupposing what a

2388.779 --> 2393.809
virus the virus like this is and how

2391.569 --> 2396.9
dangerous it would be if that was real

2393.809 --> 2399.8190000000004
then yes from that perspective

2396.9 --> 2401.619
falsifying Martin barking up people that

2399.819 --> 2404.71
just regular dead people that may have

2401.619 --> 2405.849
some kind of traces of Karuna in them as

2404.71 --> 2408.099
corona deaths

2405.849 --> 2411.01
yeah then that matters a lot because it

2408.099 --> 2413.049
throws off the statistic we are so also

2411.01 --> 2415.329
important to keep track of how viruses

2413.049 --> 2419.41
are spreading and all that remember and

2415.329 --> 2424.3900000000003
the fire ology but that's only from the

2419.41 --> 2429.549
perspective that it is real this is a

2424.39 --> 2434.529
complex situation here in people it like

2429.549 --> 2436.72
the virus perspective really is like

2434.529 --> 2439.569
another ball earth versus Flat Earth

2436.72 --> 2443.23
situation it really is just like that

2439.569 --> 2445.9
and I'm already kind of adapted to the

2443.23 --> 2447.88
presupposition of what if viruses were

2445.9 --> 2452.52
real and how do you reflect upon things

2447.88 --> 2452.52
I can do that I get that

2459.49 --> 2464.83
it's like presupposition or

2461.17 --> 2467.2000000000003
compartmentalize thinking that the

2464.83 --> 2469.81
compartmentalization is very critical

2467.2 --> 2471.6099999999997
because if you start to take some kind

2469.81 --> 2476.49
of free supposition as like you're real

2471.61 --> 2476.4900000000002
then you got a problem you lose track

2477.78 --> 2484.8
what does that have to do anything a gem

2548.51 --> 2556.19
[Music]

2576.05 --> 2583.76
hmm now come on acaba they're like the

2581.66 --> 2586.31
Portuguese sailors even though they'd

2583.76 --> 2590.8
only have a map of the known world which

2586.31 --> 2594.35
i think is very unlikely because look

2590.8 --> 2599.8
before that situation is so called

2594.35 --> 2602.63
exploration bursts from Europe it's I

2599.8 --> 2606.26
could just state as an absolute fact

2602.63 --> 2609.11
that it was all explored already before

2606.26 --> 2611.96
that and so likely that there were maps

2609.11 --> 2613.9700000000003
of the place in some way

2611.96 --> 2616.46
although Mia my landmasses may have

2613.97 --> 2619.16
shifted gone down kinda came up in

2616.46 --> 2621.62
between that time so they of course they

2619.16 --> 2626.21
had old maps to try and find their way

2621.62 --> 2628.7599999999998
again and besides that even if they

2626.21 --> 2634.76
didn't they'd always had the map of the

2628.76 --> 2637.3700000000003
stars the global stars that because that

2634.76 --> 2639.1400000000003
thing is full and that would always help

2637.37 --> 2643.25
them even if they didn't know any

2639.14 --> 2646.79
landmasses see a good Explorer back at

2643.25 --> 2649.38
that time they had to or yeah or they'd

2646.79 --> 2663.219
get lost and died never to be seen again

Navarone you were in was your birthday

2681.93 --> 2685.31
right was it yesterday

2710.61 --> 2717.3
atlases with white spots I don't know

2714.28 --> 2717.3
what that means but

2723.46 --> 2731.589
if you mean Polar Circle exclusions on

2728.05 --> 2736.03
the map yeah because yeah that may not

2731.589 --> 2738.0099999999998
may potentially not exist or just have

2736.03 --> 2742.5
never been effectively explored but

2738.01 --> 2742.5
anyone that was making maps back then

2761.83 --> 2764.889
[Music]

2768.45 --> 2772.3199999999997
yeah that's right jarred Sanford you

2770.34 --> 2775.31
gave me that link yesterday is

2772.32 --> 2775.31
interesting right

2800.42 --> 2813.3
[Music]

2808.0 --> 2815.8
oh by the way the that yet the jackdaw

2813.3 --> 2818.65
chicks in the chimney over there are

2815.8 --> 2822.94
getting big and louder they're

2818.65 --> 2826.6800000000003
screeching like very loudly now also the

2822.94 --> 2829.93
other the little bird ones down there

2826.68 --> 2831.91
they're also getting bigger like in

2829.93 --> 2834.6699999999996
between those rocks because they're loud

2831.91 --> 2837.79
enough to hear now too from a distance

2834.67 --> 2844.51
so they're growing like cabbages as they

2837.79 --> 2846.2799999999997
say in the Netherlands but yeah it's

2844.51 --> 2850.7700000000004
been great weather and plenty of moist

2846.28 --> 2850.77
so plenty of insects everywhere and

2851.099 --> 2857.13
birds are definitely having a good time

2854.29 --> 2857.13
out there right now

2859.64 --> 2862.73

2897.52 --> 2903.52

2900.6 --> 2906.33
or doesn't your instinct doesn't make

2903.52 --> 2908.65
you visualize things in your mind

2906.33 --> 2912.369
that's your mind doing that your

2908.65 --> 2916.96
instinct doesn't tell you what the shape

2912.369 --> 2919.69
of the thing you're standing on is it's

2916.96 --> 2924.15
your visual feedback it's your modeling

2919.69 --> 2924.15
senses it's it's your mind doing that

hmm

2961.84 --> 2969.79
sacred Asian man yeah well over here to

2965.08 --> 2971.68
be fair I have seen some activity with

2969.79 --> 2973.6
planes but it seemed like they were

2971.68 --> 2975.58
common trails I haven't seen anything

2973.6 --> 2981.0099999999998
that I would say okay that's definitely

2975.58 --> 2985.0
like a chem trail situation the last

2981.01 --> 2990.0400000000004
time I've seen that it's like was it I

2985.0 --> 2991.69
was right around when the the kovat 19

2990.04 --> 2996.07
was kind of being revealed on the

2991.69 --> 3001.37
television America started responding so

2996.07 --> 3001.3700000000003
that's like a it's the month ago I think

3008.02 --> 3016.35
it really does matter for how blue the

3011.95 --> 3018.8799999999997
skies are I've noticed matter so much

3016.35 --> 3023.37
there's no chemtrails that the sky is

3018.88 --> 3023.37
just better it's just more blue

3040.39 --> 3046.149
liyan matter

3043.319 --> 3051.699
dear Jim Jones you don't know the

3046.149 --> 3053.799
Himalayas are huge it's mountains you

3051.699 --> 3057.579
know that there's like entire countries

3053.799 --> 3059.199
as part of the Himalayans to the north

3057.579 --> 3060.969
that are like bordering Russia that are

3059.199 --> 3067.839
like their own countries it's just a

3060.969 --> 3071.349
pure it reminds me like they're all gem

3067.839 --> 3073.359
mines over there Neverending gems it's

3071.349 --> 3078.179
like they're like the dwarves that

3073.359 --> 3081.519
nobody knows about bordering Russia

3078.179 --> 3087.789
Turkmenistan is one of them I think it's

3081.519 --> 3090.339
also like pure Himalayan it doesn't look

3087.789 --> 3093.119
the Himalayas are just freaking massive

3090.339 --> 3093.119
it's

3098.64 --> 3106.14
as it is like as big as the mainland of

3102.57 --> 3115.8
Europe is pretty much all together that

3106.14 --> 3124.02
entire thing from say Poland to Spain

3115.8 --> 3130.2200000000003
just giant mountains I don't know should

3124.02 --> 3130.22
compare it but it's fast

3154.11 --> 3164.9100000000003
yeah Wow Tibet is already pretty big and

3158.96 --> 3168.17
that's mostly Malaya's all right so that

3164.91 --> 3172.71
thing is yeah I think I was about right

3168.17 --> 3177.5190000000002
it's it's that freaking big

3187.15 --> 3191.6800000000003

3189.82 --> 3198.04
like that is that big you can't just say

3191.68 --> 3204.8399999999997
it it is all theirs you know it's too

3198.04 --> 3204.84
big it's of the earth

3238.5 --> 3244.82
waiter missouri barest Elian are you

3241.349 --> 3249.15
back and forth thing over chemtrails

3244.82 --> 3252.78
stallion you know that geoengineering

3249.15 --> 3256.34
programs supposed experimental programs

3252.78 --> 3262.71
have been declassified and admittedly

3256.34 --> 3268.59
been in their trial phase for over a

3262.71 --> 3271.41
decade so yeah there's your evidence is

3268.59 --> 3274.55
there oh by the way another familiar

3271.41 --> 3279.2599999999998
name may pop up with then Bill Gates

3274.55 --> 3279.26
yeah so

3291.18 --> 3295.0099999999998
oh wait you're talking about Oh

3296.42 --> 3301.71
experiment some little people goody

3298.77 --> 3306.15
so why does it always have to come down

3301.71 --> 3308.46
to yeah torturing yeah just disgusting

3306.15 --> 3311.61
[ __ ] why do people this is what I mean

3308.46 --> 3315.98
what these are two people that are kind

3311.61 --> 3319.83
of good and they slide towards this see

3315.98 --> 3323.67
so one of the problems and not taking it

3319.83 --> 3326.34
as is behavior bad it's just that why

3323.67 --> 3331.05
does everybody eventually it's like oh

3326.34 --> 3333.33
look horrific evil torture and ultimate

3331.05 --> 3337.71
evil Devils and murder everything in the

3333.33 --> 3340.3199999999997
guy everybody's gonna die like why why

3337.71 --> 3345.27
does everybody always keep rolling down

3340.32 --> 3348.96
that slope don't do it don't let your

3345.27 --> 3358.44
mind roll down that slope just don't do

3348.96 --> 3361.37
it it's like put a stick in between that

3358.44 --> 3366.23
slope and the rock and stop it from

3361.37 --> 3366.23
hurling further down that freakin slope

3367.67 --> 3375.7200000000003
yeah but misery bear how much does

3372.92 --> 3380.19
talking about it all day long how much

3375.72 --> 3384.7999999999997
does it actually help people starting to

3380.19 --> 3387.66
accept it you know there's something

3384.8 --> 3392.01
called overexposure and it's like when

3387.66 --> 3393.69
you just pump too much too strong people

3392.01 --> 3399.5400000000004
are just gonna reject it because they

3393.69 --> 3403.05
can they can't handle it sometimes

3399.54 --> 3405.84
people and they it's like what are they

3403.05 --> 3407.79
gonna do with it every time you hand

3405.84 --> 3412.3500000000004
people a piece of information or try to

3407.79 --> 3414.54
relay some incredible or extreme brutal

3412.35 --> 3418.74
truth or whatever you got to realize you

3414.54 --> 3421.67
got to kind of hand them a purpose on

3418.74 --> 3424.68
what the freaking do with it as well

3421.67 --> 3426.329
otherwise it's just gonna be like a sigh

3424.68 --> 3428.5499999999997
make assaults like what the hell are

3426.329 --> 3433.6400000000003
they gonna do with that freakin

3428.55 --> 3433.6400000000003
information you know

3439.72 --> 3447.069
can look displays and things of the

3444.43 --> 3452.68
brutalities and even historical things

3447.069 --> 3459.16
it does not help you get people on your

3452.68 --> 3461.19
side in an argument on average let your

3459.16 --> 3466.93
grab ler and you're dealing with sheep

3461.19 --> 3471.69
it doesn't work it just brings down the

3466.93 --> 3480.3999999999996
frequency effectively this is this is my

3471.69 --> 3482.02
conclusion but not I'm not telling you

3480.4 --> 3484.96
they're not berating you this is not

3482.02 --> 3488.619
like a big bear berating Missouri bear

3484.96 --> 3492.339
don't worry about it it's in it you just

3488.619 --> 3494.109
happen to be the first one doing that

3492.339 --> 3496.21
again and I said it's like a lot of

3494.109 --> 3499.18
people do this like in the flatter

3496.21 --> 3502.3
discord which I mentioned before the

3499.18 --> 3506.98
show that happened to and like much much

3502.3 --> 3509.579
much worse it's just like why why does

3506.98 --> 3513.28
this always happen with people they

3509.579 --> 3515.829
always go tumbling down that hill into

3513.28 --> 3519.599
the absolute pit of hell why do they

3515.829 --> 3524.4900000000002
always do it what's the purpose of it

3519.599 --> 3530.04
what use is that it just got to end up

3524.49 --> 3530.04
balls deep in gore that's it

3537.16 --> 3540.8599999999997
but I do understand anyway the

3539.48 --> 3543.82
desperation of it because I've been

3540.86 --> 3548.06
stuck in that very position a long time

3543.82 --> 3550.8500000000004
almost subconsciously used it to keep

3548.06 --> 3559.49
myself away from getting entangled with

3550.85 --> 3562.0099999999998
regulars but it's not a good social

3559.49 --> 3567.77
approach strategy in my opinion it

3562.01 --> 3571.4300000000003
doesn't really educate that's why and

3567.77 --> 3573.65
that counts for anything that's always

3571.43 --> 3575.87
why I've said if you want to wake

3573.65 --> 3577.9100000000003
something up try to get them at

3575.87 --> 3580.37
something and figure out their comfort

3577.91 --> 3583.94
zones figure out their spiritual borders

3580.37 --> 3588.14
and then carefully tests the waters

3583.94 --> 3590.06
carefully work it in and then see if

3588.14 --> 3592.31
they notice it and if they notice it

3590.06 --> 3596.6
they have to any extreme responses they

3592.31 --> 3600.71
don't then you have an old-new depth

3596.6 --> 3603.98
scale as to what they've been likely

3600.71 --> 3606.23
through where they're probably act in a

3603.98 --> 3609.98
certain direction and yeah as you go you

3606.23 --> 3613.91
can size up much better what kind of

3609.98 --> 3618.17
information could bring them to the next

3613.91 --> 3620.24
step on their ladder and that's how you

3618.17 --> 3623.84
really awaken someone it's a very

3620.24 --> 3626.5899999999997
careful delicate process really now yeah

3623.84 --> 3629.1800000000003
this true thing has just become a shout

3626.59 --> 3631.01
extremities that may actually be rooted

3629.18 --> 3634.16
in reality in some way but just shout it

3631.01 --> 3636.71
out there and it's not exactly the same

3634.16 --> 3642.92
thing I didn't yeah

3636.71 --> 3647.29
but it's there anyway enough rambling

3642.92 --> 3647.29
about that I'm gonna round out the show

3648.7 --> 3654.1699999999996
upside ahead yeah and totally get it

3651.35 --> 3658.5499999999997
bizarre bear I did get it yeah he is a

3654.17 --> 3660.53
baller of course I didn't want to make

3658.55 --> 3663.28
an example out of you said you have

3660.53 --> 3663.28
nothing to worry about

3665.98 --> 3672.2
yeah I guess I kind of used it as an

3670.579 --> 3674.2400000000002
excuse to Reno because it is an issue

3672.2 --> 3678.68
that I'm concerned with it's like I

3674.24 --> 3684.2599999999998
don't like it never been I can't get

3678.68 --> 3691.3689999999997
used to it and I'm glad I can't I would

3684.26 --> 3693.829
never want that filth to be floating

3691.369 --> 3697.13
around it's like it's so bad to me that

3693.829 --> 3699.9500000000003
even in Dungeons and Dragons games where

3697.13 --> 3702.2000000000003
I have to summon up villains right have

3699.95 --> 3703.6899999999996
to create them from scratch have them

3702.2 --> 3706.73
give them character give them purpose

3703.69 --> 3711.079
even just to be destroyed they have to

3706.73 --> 3714.619
have some reality feel to it I realized

3711.079 --> 3716.8390000000004
there's so much fucked-up [ __ ] I could

3714.619 --> 3720.079
do with that just to create the horror

3716.839 --> 3723.29
situations to force motivation but then

3720.079 --> 3728.599
I can't do it I can't do a captain I

3723.29 --> 3734.66
can't I just can't do it because then I

3728.599 --> 3737.96
I open up that that game and it's

3734.66 --> 3742.22
tainted the frequency of the game then

3737.96 --> 3744.849
so I have to put a sort of soft evil

3742.22 --> 3750.3799999999997
that's still evil enough it's like the

3744.849 --> 3752.15
Star Wars type evil you know it is with

3750.38 --> 3756.92
Star Wars you know the Empire and that

3752.15 --> 3760.19
they're very evil but they don't just

3756.92 --> 3762.65
rub gore in your face constantly or

3760.19 --> 3765.26
something you know they're not like

3762.65 --> 3768.2000000000003
total psychopathic maniacs out of

3765.26 --> 3770.6600000000003
control [ __ ] so I try to be careful with

3768.2 --> 3771.71
that and that yeah it's it's basically

3770.66 --> 3775.3689999999997
the same thing

3771.71 --> 3777.92
just don't go rolling down that slope

3775.369 --> 3781.55
don't let it slide with anything not

3777.92 --> 3784.15
even with fantasy games I don't do it I

3781.55 --> 3789.17
just can't do it anymore

3784.15 --> 3791.15
