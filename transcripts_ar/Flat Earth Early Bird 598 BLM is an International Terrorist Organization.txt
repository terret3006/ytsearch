151.0 --> 159.28
there and yeah and I got yeah I got a

155.37 --> 160.93
song I had basically was given a song to

159.28 --> 164.14000000000001
listen and said that I could play it on

160.93 --> 166.45000000000002

164.14 --> 169.05999999999997
it before the show would be starting and

166.45 --> 171.19
ya had to get coffee and still had a

169.06 --> 175.42000000000002
joint to smoke is how it all just didn't

171.19 --> 178.81
really work out timewise but I loved the

175.42 --> 183.82
conversation over there and yeah the the

178.81 --> 187.12
song is a rap song from Elijah flat

183.82 --> 189.35999999999999
earth based with some samples even with

Saleem I was but I was yeah I was just

205.39 --> 210.19
poking him with that you know like the

208.15 --> 214.57
whole rap thing kind of overcame

210.19 --> 216.4
chocolate it just hit him and I said

214.57 --> 218.47
like yeah if it hits you that easily

216.4 --> 220.989
that quick it's very likely it's going

218.47 --> 223.6
to end up in an entire album if it just

220.989 --> 226.17000000000002
rolls out like that and he was like nah

223.6 --> 232.48

232.48 --> 236.54999999999998

pretty long all about the salt and the

320.53 --> 326.90999999999997
oil he expanded upon the consult concept

323.02 --> 330.84999999999997
and salt oil it's an interesting

326.91 --> 333.31
perception we and of course the

330.85 --> 337.48
Barataria themed songs which are really

333.31 --> 339.91
awesome like campfire songs that was

two episode SEP the man they called

Jaden he gives to defer and he takes

355.09 --> 359.56
from the rich yeah yeah

357.46 --> 366.90999999999997
yeah that's my favorite episode from by

359.56 --> 369.81
longshot like the looks on everybody's

366.91 --> 372.81
faces when that happens it's just it's

369.81 --> 372.81
priceless

373.02 --> 386.77
yeah right I'm so glad you're enjoying

382.87 --> 390.7
it Robin yeah it's almost like Oh

386.77 --> 392.62
somebody's I'm almost like indirectly

390.7 --> 398.95
enjoying this from you because I just

392.62 --> 401.32
remember how awesome it was and to just

398.95 --> 406.18
get that moment it's almost like you you

401.32 --> 412.77
have your Firefly virginity it's being

406.18 --> 412.77
taken right now it's that special anyway

420.36 --> 429.78000000000003
okay 594 and ninety eight hours that's a

428.25 --> 435.96
little more than that though outreach

429.78 --> 438.98999999999995
man significantly more and what exactly

435.96 --> 442.79999999999995
are we talking about outreach is what

438.99 --> 447.659
talking about movies talking about some

442.8 --> 452.039
chat I had or something I watched our is

447.659 --> 455.34
this just a copy-paste [ __ ] troll

452.039 --> 462.0
remark it's not ready to thought out

455.34 --> 467.719
that well alright maybe it's the title

462.0 --> 471.24
it is kind of yeah one of those titles

467.719 --> 474.629
but yeah there's a lot of crazy stuff

471.24 --> 476.849
going on out there in the news too I

474.629 --> 483.719
guess I looked upon that as well

476.849 --> 485.819
and it's making me sick it's now there's

483.719 --> 488.31
the thing about it that I do not know a

485.819 --> 490.5
hundred percent certain about every

488.31 --> 492.93
story that's put out about this because

490.5 --> 497.069
yeah they they're known to kind of like

492.93 --> 499.74
make these heartbreaking stories that

497.069 --> 503.52000000000004
well sometimes eventually turn out not

499.74 --> 508.669
to be real but I'm sure there's plenty

503.52 --> 512.579
of real [ __ ] going on and yet Saros

508.669 --> 514.3489999999999
giving money to BLM and just what

512.579 --> 517.38
they're all doing and in the Netherlands

514.349 --> 518.5500000000001
too it's really disgusting and I'm just

517.38 --> 519.719
yeah

518.55 --> 522.199
I'm just calling it a terrorist

519.719 --> 525.089
organization because that's what it is

522.199 --> 531.5889999999999
it's it's a politically Marxist

525.089 --> 538.0
terrorist organization it's what they do

531.589 --> 540.8900000000001
their methods and yeah

538.0 --> 553.06
how long is it gonna take before before

540.89 --> 553.06
that becomes official we'll see

561.32 --> 566.8290000000001
the Guns of Navarone or peanut sounds

564.47 --> 566.8290000000001
creepy

583.77 --> 591.43
Freeman really it's nothing to fear so

588.25 --> 593.2
you don't find it a bad thing that

591.43 --> 599.53
there's literally money being given to

593.2 --> 604.4200000000001
people - yeah - peer pressure right to

599.53 --> 607.4499999999999
act like corporate Brownshirts to attack

604.42 --> 612.0999999999999
people for insane reasons you think

607.45 --> 614.47
that's not a threat I kind of do now of

612.1 --> 616.72
course the threat is always because that

614.47 --> 619.8100000000001
always happens it's gonna be drawn drawn

616.72 --> 622.51
out of proportion overemphasize but that

619.81 --> 630.4599999999999
doesn't mean it that isn't technically a

622.51 --> 638.17
danger right thank exactly they haven't

630.46 --> 642.34
attacked anyone well all right free mind

638.17 --> 644.05
if you could basically point yeah I'll

642.34 --> 650.5600000000001
do some reason if you really believe

644.05 --> 653.1999999999999
that did you find any evidence that is

650.56 --> 655.78
all faked that there's no nothing like

653.2 --> 658.99
that happening or is it just a couple of

655.78 --> 661.51
people you know that kind of join to the

658.99 --> 667.95
side of BLM sympathize with it and don't

661.51 --> 667.95
really join these sponsored actions I

668.19 --> 671.9100000000001
watch them every day

673.189 --> 682.699
all right at this one that's just your

680.459 --> 682.699
words

698.51 --> 705.56
but hey it might technically be a

701.389 --> 708.589
possibility only at this point it's yeah

705.56 --> 710.6899999999999
whether the things are really physically

708.589 --> 714.769
happening on the ground or it's simply

710.69 --> 716.75
the next weapon to agitate everyone with

714.769 --> 720.01
I'm pretty sure that everybody's kind of

716.75 --> 720.01
sick of it one way or the other

732.77 --> 737.17
okay for you minded sure sure

743.87 --> 748.35
the government-sponsored movement from

746.46 --> 752.52
the legitimate ones yeah but that's the

748.35 --> 756.99
whole design that's how it works they

752.52 --> 760.1999999999999
create a supposed grassroots supposedly

756.99 --> 766.7
innocent type of thing come yeah which

760.2 --> 770.25
is socialists driven thing and then they

766.7 --> 773.76
when it's big enough and they yeah they

770.25 --> 778.49
are guided by programs do things do

773.76 --> 782.8199999999999
actions and then the militarized part of

778.49 --> 785.88
that same organization uses all that and

782.82 --> 789.9200000000001
what is being put out there and thus the

785.88 --> 796.17
actual militarized actions as it were so

789.92 --> 802.92
yeah it's part of the mechanism it's a

796.17 --> 805.38
two-faced system every time you got the

802.92 --> 808.7099999999999
the dummies from the schools from

805.38 --> 813.63
wherever doing their part and then you

808.71 --> 816.48
got the yeah the whatever the organized

813.63 --> 822.83
police or whatever they are the agents

816.48 --> 822.83
in plain clothing doing the nasty [ __ ]

823.37 --> 830.09
right Roger exactly but that that's

826.98 --> 830.09
always the guideline

833.89 --> 841.11
right and the insane part is is that it

839.14 --> 847.38
seems to be all centralized around

841.11 --> 852.4590000000001
police like if the police were not

847.38 --> 855.06
literally organizing this doing exactly

852.459 --> 859.5999999999999
what they do there would be nothing that

855.06 --> 861.8499999999999
it wouldn't be possible so yeah you can

859.6 --> 866.5600000000001
almost literally just put it on them

861.85 --> 869.35
like yeah you are doing this and not the

866.56 --> 872.529
the cop that's just trying to make a

869.35 --> 875.0790000000001
living and doing his best or whatever no

872.529 --> 876.73
the police had chiefs that are rolling

875.079 --> 879.0999999999999
out the programs that are giving the

876.73 --> 881.29
orders that are peer pressuring people

879.1 --> 885.57
that probably involved in blackmail and

881.29 --> 889.8389999999999
all kinds of disgusting [ __ ] allegedly

885.57 --> 895.089
right that's the problem they're the

889.839 --> 899.98
ones literally driving this one part and

895.089 --> 903.4200000000001
on the other part are the the covert

899.98 --> 907.0
operation teams and plain clothing

903.42 --> 907.51
situations it's yeah that's what that's

907.0 --> 909.699
what it is

907.51 --> 913.42
that's what I think it is it's what I've

909.699 --> 916.029
seen it is my entire lifetime every time

913.42 --> 919.39
there's [ __ ] going down it's all ways

916.029 --> 923.16
the [ __ ] police chief every single

919.39 --> 923.16
time every time

927.109 --> 933.979
and if it isn't then that guy is the one

930.719 --> 936.839
getting massively attacked by the media

933.979 --> 939.4390000000001
by the Marxist organizations called

936.839 --> 942.9290000000001
erases anything to get them out of there

939.439 --> 946.429
and if they are the cause then nobody

942.929 --> 951.169
talks about them ever that's what it is

946.429 --> 956.0989999999999
the media topples the police power that

951.169 --> 958.949
let the corrupt control key personnel

956.099 --> 961.2890000000001
slip in and take the reigns in that

958.949 --> 964.2289999999999
location in order to roll out more

961.289 --> 967.3389999999999
Marxist destructive operations that's

964.229 --> 967.339
what it is people

986.05 --> 991.52
police chief's answer to the government

988.7 --> 994.07
organizers yeah but they have no right

991.52 --> 996.4399999999999
to do that that is corrupt that they do

994.07 --> 999.1600000000001
that and there are police chiefs that

996.44 --> 1001.3000000000001
don't answer to the organizers and

999.16 --> 1003.9399999999999
they're the ones getting attacked by the

1001.3 --> 1007.0899999999999
media track the frame them and all that

1003.94 --> 1014.5300000000001
[ __ ] to get them out publicly shame them

1007.09 --> 1018.5500000000001
and all that [ __ ] till they give up so

1014.53 --> 1023.1999999999999
technically they don't answer they they

1018.55 --> 1026.37
put people in those spots that answer to

1023.2 --> 1029.65
the organizers because they shouldn't

1026.37 --> 1032.589
that's corrupt if they did because they

1029.65 --> 1035.47
are there to maintain order not to help

1032.589 --> 1037.6
political movements manipulate and

1035.47 --> 1042.06
pressure everyone that's their political

1037.6 --> 1042.06
opponent that's illegal

1044.849 --> 1052.73
[Music]

1047.42 --> 1069.5600000000002
I think that's pretty universally

1052.73 --> 1072.74
illegal everywhere to do that all right

1069.56 --> 1075.8899999999999
so hey if you know a police chief or

1072.74 --> 1078.77
you've your heard of like a you whatever

1075.89 --> 1081.5900000000001
your County and the police chief is

1078.77 --> 1083.3899999999999
known to be an old block code guy might

1081.59 --> 1086.4199999999998
have some personal problems might not be

1083.39 --> 1090.44
perfect you know maybe even a class

1086.42 --> 1094.91
skeleton a closet some kind but they are

1090.44 --> 1097.16
not cooperating with this [ __ ] well help

1094.91 --> 1100.22
them support them help defend them

1097.16 --> 1103.7900000000002
against this Marxist media attack

1100.22 --> 1106.55
crackdown you know you got to protect

1103.79 --> 1108.74
the ones that get attacked especially

1106.55 --> 1113.8999999999999
locally like make this a natural

1108.74 --> 1116.1200000000001
reaction if the Beast the Machine is

1113.9 --> 1119.7800000000002
attacking somebody near you

1116.12 --> 1122.51
you must defend them if you don't then

1119.78 --> 1124.6399999999999
yeah the whole thing is just going to

1122.51 --> 1127.34
grow worse and worse and worse until you

1124.64 --> 1133.3700000000001
can't even defend anyone anymore against

1127.34 --> 1136.79
it so take notice of this around your

1133.37 --> 1138.6499999999999
city wherever who are the people running

1136.79 --> 1143.6
it how do they function who are they

1138.65 --> 1145.7
connected to how flexible are they what

1143.6 --> 1150.4099999999999
are their personal visions that they've

1145.7 --> 1151.97
pretty much proved that they follow all

1150.41 --> 1156.41
these things now that's a lot of work

1151.97 --> 1159.77
and hey look at me I I don't know

1156.41 --> 1163.49
anybody personally out there in my city

1159.77 --> 1165.41
like I just kind of pay attention like

1163.49 --> 1167.93
oh this guy in government something

1165.41 --> 1170.51
happens and then I like make a note and

1167.93 --> 1172.01
I hope that after many many years and

1170.51 --> 1174.2
we'll have so many of these moments

1172.01 --> 1179.09
together that I kind of can get a

1174.2 --> 1181.059
picture clear that'll help me guide into

1179.09 --> 1185.269
decision making

1181.059 --> 1187.759
but so far not so much as I said I've

1185.269 --> 1189.74
always kept my distance from it because

1187.759 --> 1198.039
it just makes me all sick and unnerved

1189.74 --> 1202.99
me but that's gonna change slowly but

1198.039 --> 1202.99
gradually anyway

1205.45 --> 1208.559
[Music]

1217.04 --> 1229.8799999999999
right so yeah that's current world's

1222.86 --> 1231.35
affairs piece about 20 minutes yeah if

1229.88 --> 1236.0500000000002
we want to move up to Flat Earth or

1231.35 --> 1236.05
something I'm all up for it

1236.95 --> 1241.94
anybody want me to clarify specific

1240.05 --> 1245.75
cosmogenic concept that I've laid out

1241.94 --> 1248.0
before or like I kind of just

1245.75 --> 1251.48
complaining yesterday anybody have

1248.0 --> 1253.73
something they don't understand or they

1251.48 --> 1256.4
think that I might have overlooked a

1253.73 --> 1261.05
detail you might you may be cocky about

1256.4 --> 1263.8700000000001
it please just any inquiry you think I

1261.05 --> 1266.6
overlooked something in some way or you

1263.87 --> 1269.0
may think like whoa I've got this thing

1266.6 --> 1271.1
but I'm not too sure maybe it is

1269.0 --> 1273.17
something or we actually overlooked and

1271.1 --> 1274.04
for some reason it slipped into my mind

1273.17 --> 1277.67
and I have to share it

1274.04 --> 1280.1299999999999
do it bring it out anything about a

1277.67 --> 1281.69
rectangular looping system which is the

1280.13 --> 1285.95
thing that is the concept that I wield

1281.69 --> 1289.25
the most please share your insights and

1285.95 --> 1294.17
this can look I explained it yesterday

1289.25 --> 1297.16
even the loop it could be anything like

1294.17 --> 1300.7
the irregularities like it could be

1297.16 --> 1307.99
absolutely surreal much more surreal

1300.7 --> 1310.99
it's still going yeah should be back now

1307.99 --> 1310.99
hmm

1312.85 --> 1315.8899999999999
[Music]

1320.4 --> 1328.0900000000001
right yeah I had a connection issue but

1326.14 --> 1332.91
I was quick so didn't cut off the

1328.09 --> 1337.26
Hangout you D guys didn't miss a lot

1332.91 --> 1343.42
your phone crashed okay that's weird

1337.26 --> 1347.26
anyway yeah the world could be quite

1343.42 --> 1349.69
surreal in the cosmogony of it although

1347.26 --> 1351.85
natural law will not be broken you know

1349.69 --> 1354.8400000000001
it's more the spatial interconnection

1351.85 --> 1357.73
qualities that may be quite surreal

1354.84 --> 1362.98
natural law still stands and that is

1357.73 --> 1367.81
something that makes it viable

1362.98 --> 1373.09
despite the surreal potential of it in

1367.81 --> 1375.76
the face of the globe cosmology which

1373.09 --> 1378.61
arrests some presupposition of

1375.76 --> 1388.41
foundations that have already been

1378.61 --> 1392.32
disproven see anyway if you guys want to

1388.41 --> 1395.01
hear me elaborate on anything please let

1392.32 --> 1395.01
me know in chat

1396.4 --> 1409.9
Oh Roche no I haven't heard you I

1407.04 --> 1414.6299999999999
thought I recognized a Dutch person

1409.9 --> 1414.63
there was that was that you huh

1421.21 --> 1426.24
I thought your English was pretty good

1426.36 --> 1432.1299999999999
like for a Dutch for a Dutch person it

1430.059 --> 1436.99
was really it was well-structured so

1432.13 --> 1439.029
yeah you have potential for this but

1436.99 --> 1442.63
yeah it's a learning process man and it

1439.029 --> 1444.399
takes years of practice it's not just

1442.63 --> 1446.1100000000001
about looking and listening it's really

1444.399 --> 1448.75
about doing it and figuring it out

1446.11 --> 1451.9289999999999
intuitively takes years to get really

1448.75 --> 1457.72
good at and I've got a half a decade

1451.929 --> 1459.549
practice now really matters so you have

1457.72 --> 1462.13
to be patient if you want to get really

1459.549 --> 1464.58
serious with this but you got potential

1462.13 --> 1464.5800000000002
my man

1481.62 --> 1494.9699999999998
oh okay well bend a goose pal I want to

1490.409 --> 1500.97
ask that how can I explain that the Sun

1494.97 --> 1503.07
is local to others how can you explain

1500.97 --> 1505.3500000000001
it well if you are going to presuppose

1503.07 --> 1508.85
that the Sun is local then you would

1505.35 --> 1512.48
have to explain to them trigonometry and

1508.85 --> 1516.09
how trigonometry really does rest on a

1512.48 --> 1518.34
presumption of a surface type so if

1516.09 --> 1522.0
you're going to presuppose the Sun is

1518.34 --> 1525.36
extremely far away that is Co consistent

1522.0 --> 1528.779
with a globe foundational presupposition

1525.36 --> 1530.9399999999998
within the trigonometry system in

1528.779 --> 1535.409
relation to the heavens right how they

1530.94 --> 1537.6200000000001
are angled but if you instead of

1535.409 --> 1541.94
presupposing a globe as a foundation

1537.62 --> 1544.8899999999999
presuppose a disc then suddenly the

1541.94 --> 1548.49
triangulations will work out in a

1544.89 --> 1550.7990000000002
different if they they will position

1548.49 --> 1552.24
themselves because of the different

1550.799 --> 1555.12
presupposition in a different location

1552.24 --> 1558.09
that makes the Sun much more local

1555.12 --> 1561.87
around 3,000 miles away instead of that

1558.09 --> 1563.6689999999999
what is it the 93 million miles so that

1561.87 --> 1567.36
is how you can explain that if you're

1563.669 --> 1570.2990000000002
going to presuppose based on physicality

1567.36 --> 1572.899
assumption bias that the celestial

1570.299 --> 1576.27
lights all of them are literally in

1572.899 --> 1578.1589999999999
physical things in literal spots because

1576.27 --> 1581.25
that is a presupposition that I've kind

1578.159 --> 1582.659
of worked on trying to dispel because I

1581.25 --> 1585.96
don't think they are I think they are

1582.659 --> 1588.419
purely holographic like optical

1585.96 --> 1591.059
phenomena and they're not coming from

1588.419 --> 1596.6100000000001
objects from literal location - they're

1591.059 --> 1599.37
rather unique light based imprints that

1596.61 --> 1602.82
just happen to be part of the realm and

1599.37 --> 1606.2399999999998
the probably electric in nature it's

1602.82 --> 1608.309
like a backdrop that just causes lights

1606.24 --> 1611.159
you have the light to manifest the way

1608.309 --> 1614.6689999999999
it does specifically in relation to the

1611.159 --> 1615.5
position so the light is basically just

1614.669 --> 1618.5300000000002
like

1615.5 --> 1621.41
Manifest it appears like that with the

1618.53 --> 1624.83
visual side effects in that location if

1621.41 --> 1627.2
you trying to follow one of these lights

1624.83 --> 1629.96
directly towards them they will

1627.2 --> 1632.81
dissipate they will disappear from view

1629.96 --> 1635.0900000000001
or they will Bend away you can approach

1632.81 --> 1636.77
the Sun you can't approach the moon you

1635.09 --> 1639.8
can't approach any of it it'll Bend away

1636.77 --> 1644.57
which is typically what happens when

1639.8 --> 1647.68
interacting spatially distance with

1644.57 --> 1651.86
holographic phenomena that is why I take

1647.68 --> 1654.8300000000002
that step because the correlation just

1651.86 --> 1659.24
matches perfectly it's not direct

1654.83 --> 1662.12
physical proof but just weighing the

1659.24 --> 1663.83
options weighing the data it seems much

1662.12 --> 1665.87
more likely to me that they are light

1663.83 --> 1668.12
based holographic phenomena that that

1665.87 --> 1673.52
they are physical objects in any kind of

1668.12 --> 1676.4299999999998
way because they don't match the aspects

1673.52 --> 1678.68
of physicality you can't approach them

1676.43 --> 1681.0800000000002
they don't grow an angular size when you

1678.68 --> 1684.2
move straight towards them the phenomena

1681.08 --> 1686.1499999999999
the light and that is all part of

1684.2 --> 1688.28
physical nature so they lack those

1686.15 --> 1692.92
aspects and therefore only the

1688.28 --> 1697.76
holographic aspects remain and that's

1692.92 --> 1699.8600000000001
why I follow that conception of the

1697.76 --> 1701.69
heavenly lights versus any kind of

1699.86 --> 1705.8799999999999
physical objects in literal

1701.69 --> 1705.88
locations I hope that clarifies

1709.39 --> 1720.26
maybe a bit complicated sorry but if if

1716.54 --> 1728.84
you have trouble like understanding just

1720.26 --> 1731.05
I don't know listen back that's a funny

1728.84 --> 1733.6699999999998
thing about me just doing things online

1731.05 --> 1735.8899999999999
it's recorded so hey if you don't get it

1733.67 --> 1737.54
the first time or you kind of didn't pay

1735.89 --> 1738.89
too much attention and you really want

1737.54 --> 1741.86
to know yeah you can play it back and

1738.89 --> 1744.14
just watch me explain it again and again

1741.86 --> 1753.11
and again as many times as you want as

1744.14 --> 1755.98
many times as you need uh okay Marceline

1753.11 --> 1759.02
what's that

1755.98 --> 1761.44
literally making a straight path to

1759.02 --> 1761.44
circumnavigate

1761.809 --> 1769.46
on a ball all right

1766.119 --> 1774.559
North will always be under left on the

1769.46 --> 1778.219
globe right yeah and so will it in a

1774.559 --> 1781.759
rectangular looping system where the

1778.219 --> 1782.769
equator line is proven to be perfectly

1781.759 --> 1785.8990000000001
straight

1782.769 --> 1788.359
you know because yeah it can be straight

1785.899 --> 1792.049
line looping in on itself but there's

1788.359 --> 1793.4289999999999
still no curvature so yeah even if that

1792.049 --> 1794.539
turns out to be the case you know the

1793.429 --> 1796.549
globe hahaha

1794.539 --> 1798.859
see it's not a circle and a disc it's

1796.549 --> 1801.9189999999999
not a circle a disc then it's then you

1798.859 --> 1803.6589999999999
come to me let me do my thing and tell

1801.919 --> 1806.8390000000002
them yeah that's really nice you got

1803.659 --> 1808.729
your virtual equator that really works

1806.839 --> 1811.399
out perfectly on the globe if you

1808.729 --> 1815.69
presuppose it's curved curving in on

1811.399 --> 1818.2389999999998
itself vertically from your personal

1815.69 --> 1820.6290000000001
perspective right well it's not still no

1818.239 --> 1820.6290000000001
curvature

1825.51 --> 1832.77
right but yes technically on the globe

1829.049 --> 1835.95
the north will always be at your at your

1832.77 --> 1839.04
right but that may be very similarly the

1835.95 --> 1842.52
case on a rectangular looping with a

1839.04 --> 1845.3899999999999
straight equator line you know the north

1842.52 --> 1851.52
and the south on a rectangular looping

1845.39 --> 1853.2900000000002
system are yeah how do you call that the

1851.52 --> 1860.04
north-south east-west are basically

1853.29 --> 1863.549
perfectly attuned to to the Euclidean

1860.04 --> 1866.1599999999999
geometry just north is always going to

1863.549 --> 1867.72
be that direction South is always going

1866.16 --> 1869.88
to be the opposite direction no matter

1867.72 --> 1873.48
where you are used to west are always

1869.88 --> 1876.45
going to be perpendicular to that every

1873.48 --> 1878.3700000000001
single time that's how it works in a

1876.45 --> 1881.51
rectangular looping model where the

1878.37 --> 1886.34
equator line turns out to be straight

1881.51 --> 1888.809
now in an irregular looping system yeah

1886.34 --> 1891.78
you couldn't say that if the if it is

1888.809 --> 1894.1399999999999
right irregular looping then yeah there

1891.78 --> 1898.85
is no absolute north-south east-west

1894.14 --> 1898.8500000000001
could be warped in all kinds of ways Oh

1905.12 --> 1912.4799999999998
13:35 is it possible to disprove the

1911.04 --> 1918.27
globe by traveling east to west on the

1912.48 --> 1923.179
equator plane would need to take a left

1918.27 --> 1923.179
turn constantly no Marceline as I said

1926.49 --> 1933.64
that's a false dichotomy you're

1929.94 --> 1937.54
presupposing only two options based on

1933.64 --> 1939.8200000000002
absolute fitting physical literalness so

1937.54 --> 1943.12
like oh it's a straight line so it must

1939.82 --> 1946.51
be a globe oh it's a circle so it must

1943.12 --> 1948.2199999999998
be a literal disc those are that's the

1946.51 --> 1949.78
false dichotomy you've put down there

1948.22 --> 1952.29
and I've kind of already addressed all

1949.78 --> 1952.29
of it so

1960.56 --> 1966.5
you know establishing the art did the

1963.2 --> 1971.93
geometrical orientation of the equator

1966.5 --> 1976.43
line it's only the first step in the X

1971.93 --> 1979.49
in figuring out the exact cosmo cosmo

1976.43 --> 1992.54
Garnica layout of the land masses and

1979.49 --> 1993.2
ocean bottoms alright yeah thanks for

1992.54 --> 1998.09
asking

1993.2 --> 1999.73
you know always good there's no stupid

1998.09 --> 2005.6499999999999
questions

1999.73 --> 2009.3600000000001
there's only stupid answers or red

2005.65 --> 2009.3600000000001
herrings or while they're stupid do so

2024.17 --> 2028.8790000000001
right

2025.97 --> 2031.46
well luck Mazar salim d the dichotomy

2028.879 --> 2034.759
that you basically put forward the the

2031.46 --> 2037.519
disc versus the globe is a very old

2034.759 --> 2039.35
dichotomy it's that was what was being

2037.519 --> 2042.86
championed in the early days for like

2039.35 --> 2044.629
the first three years and then i came in

2042.86 --> 2046.1899999999998
between and kind of got in the way and

2044.629 --> 2049.639
everybody was what the [ __ ] is this

2046.19 --> 2051.409
Arwen blabbering about about his looping

2049.639 --> 2054.05
nonsense you know

2051.409 --> 2057.02
so everybody stuck to those dichotomies

2054.05 --> 2060.4900000000002
it was very frustrating for me at the

2057.02 --> 2063.71
time nobody even got it or avoiding me

2060.49 --> 2067.4599999999996
but hey I stuck to it I expanded upon it

2063.71 --> 2070.429
I clarified it much much more and you

2067.46 --> 2075.5
know I think one day the time will come

2070.429 --> 2077.829
where more people may dare to touch upon

2075.5 --> 2077.829
it

2079.8 --> 2082.9190000000003
[Music]

2108.14 --> 2113.3599999999997
well Guns of Navarone I repeat what you

2110.33 --> 2115.93
put down there yes sure but it's you you

2113.36 --> 2121.01
still are in that presupposing the Sun

2115.93 --> 2123.22
to be a literal object figure it out

2121.01 --> 2125.51
through trigonometry based on

2123.22 --> 2128.23
presupposition of an orientation of the

2125.51 --> 2128.23
realm so

2152.48 --> 2158.81
you missed the looping model somehow

2155.35 --> 2166.31
really IRA Neffe I've been talking about

2158.81 --> 2167.6
this for four years this well I'm not

2166.31 --> 2171.7599999999998
there's not a lot of people out there

2167.6 --> 2174.47
that do talk about it so yeah

2171.76 --> 2176.78
percentage-wise the amount of coverage

2174.47 --> 2179.77
that the looping concept has had over

2176.78 --> 2184.61
all the shows that typically get watched

2179.77 --> 2190.46
it's gonna be less than a percent much

2184.61 --> 2193.31
less so yeah unless you bump into me and

2190.46 --> 2195.17
hear me talking about it and it catches

2193.31 --> 2198.07
your interest it's not very likely

2195.17 --> 2201.37
you're gonna bump into the concept

2198.07 --> 2206.02
unless somebody else tells you about it

2201.37 --> 2206.02
about me and that I talk about that

2213.72 --> 2218.64
yeah the Sun looks like a spotlight yeah

2216.21 --> 2224.15
that's I know it does look like it

2218.64 --> 2229.31
doesn't it but it's not though because

2224.15 --> 2232.4700000000003
get closer it's really a spotlight then

2229.31 --> 2234.75
let's get let's get in that spotlight

2232.47 --> 2239.2999999999997
let's establish a proximity let's

2234.75 --> 2242.72
establish a significant increase in

2239.3 --> 2245.78
energy absorption which would absolutely

2242.72 --> 2249.2099999999996
correlate the pattern of increase would

2245.78 --> 2251.6600000000003
could potentially correlate with a

2249.21 --> 2258.18
proximity increase to an energy source

2251.66 --> 2264.77
so yeah where is that how many young

2258.18 --> 2264.77
this welcome back

2270.4 --> 2279.339
you put specific links links to specific

2273.88 --> 2282.67
looping shows or you could search you

2279.339 --> 2284.94
know let me try to do that let's see how

2282.67 --> 2294.01
that works out

2284.94 --> 2301.7200000000003
just YouTube's search or rectangular and

2294.01 --> 2304.63
looping oh wow

2301.72 --> 2310.98
you get a lot of troll [ __ ] on the first

2304.63 --> 2310.98
page at least and yeah

2314.67 --> 2325.539
what the [ __ ] Jesus dig it's a lot of

2319.599 --> 2329.0190000000002
[ __ ] about me saying but yeah in the

2325.539 --> 2333.279
search results there's like at least six

2329.019 --> 2340.9599999999996
shows about it in there from the early

2333.279 --> 2345.69
bird show and from way back but yeah if

2340.96 --> 2351.969
you just go to my channel itself and

2345.69 --> 2356.619
just yeah what you could do is search in

2351.969 --> 2359.2290000000003
videos and then order sort by and

2356.619 --> 2365.049
reverse it so resort

2359.229 --> 2367.749
order by they'd added oldest then you

2365.049 --> 2369.969
get to see flatter talk stuff like from

2367.749 --> 2372.9889999999996
the beginning and then if you scroll

2369.969 --> 2378.7000000000003
down a little the rectangular looping

2372.989 --> 2382.869
will absolutely pop up very quickly so

2378.7 --> 2387.18
for example flat earth talks the

2382.869 --> 2389.829
rectangular looping flat earth I could

2387.18 --> 2393.519
link it up for you guys just for the

2389.829 --> 2397.17
convenience of it this is the first

2393.519 --> 2397.1699999999996
official hangout about that

2401.47 --> 2406.6699999999996
then proving the rectangular looping

2404.54 --> 2411.2799999999997
model now you have to take in mind these

2406.67 --> 2416.57
are really old and I hadn't figured out

2411.28 --> 2421.6400000000003
science yet so I was still using more

2416.57 --> 2425.57
improvised descriptor ii yeah i was more

2421.64 --> 2431.3599999999997
descriptive less technically solid in

2425.57 --> 2433.6600000000003
ways it's more fluid and i didn't have a

2431.36 --> 2433.6600000000003
mustache

2440.88 --> 2444.4700000000003
see else

2446.04 --> 2453.86
right a does to our good shows about it

2450.62 --> 2453.8599999999997
might help

2468.77 --> 2471.82
[Music]

2474.27 --> 2482.55
what are you talking about Guns of

2476.28 --> 2484.7000000000003
Navarone you're presupposing you are

2482.55 --> 2487.1400000000003
going in the full circle on the equator

2484.7 --> 2490.64
you're presupposing you have no proof

2487.14 --> 2494.67
that that is the case has to be first

2490.64 --> 2498.42
established if that is the case it's a

2494.67 --> 2500.76
foundational art yeah found a foundation

2498.42 --> 2507.92
you need in order to actually figure out

2500.76 --> 2510.92
what the options are in this realm okay

2507.92 --> 2510.92
right

2548.109 --> 2554.17
okay Church Sanford why would you look

2550.539 --> 2559.869
at the Sun then I think my retinas are

2554.17 --> 2562.569
very happy about that now on the other

2559.869 --> 2564.5190000000002
hand I do look at the Sun with my eyes

2562.569 --> 2566.769
closed and there's still plenty of light

2564.519 --> 2569.339
that's gonna shine into my pineal gland

2566.769 --> 2569.339
when I do that

2581.04 --> 2587.1
to see as it is well you can't really

2584.94 --> 2598.8
see it as it is because it's like a

2587.1 --> 2602.39
blinding effect did you just see the the

2598.8 --> 2606.15
overly bright disc almost like a hole in

2602.39 --> 2609.0
visual reality that's how I experienced

2606.15 --> 2611.46
it when I first try to conceive like

2609.0 --> 2613.58
what I what it is like that I'm seeing

2611.46 --> 2619.23
it's like it seems like there's a hole

2613.58 --> 2621.69
in visual reality from which apparently

2619.23 --> 2624.72
this light is emanating but in

2621.69 --> 2627.87
retrospect I I'm more convinced that the

2624.72 --> 2631.14
Sun disc the thing we see is just an

2627.87 --> 2634.77
optical side effect of looking into the

2631.14 --> 2637.3199999999997
direction of the daylight which emanates

2634.77 --> 2642.5
from that point in relation specifically

2637.32 --> 2645.42
to that location that's how I see it

2642.5 --> 2649.05
like the disc is an optical side effect

2645.42 --> 2651.92
not the cause in my presumptions

2649.05 --> 2651.92
currently

2674.56 --> 2678.0
okay George Sanford

2680.63 --> 2683.7690000000002
[Music]

2688.75 --> 2696.09
[Music]

2697.2 --> 2703.75
of course you can presuppose things

2700.78 --> 2706.6600000000003
Ragnar Stefan he'll listen the thing is

2703.75 --> 2709.69
though if you want to really figure it

2706.66 --> 2713.19
out then you will not use aspects

2709.69 --> 2716.01
they're adamantly disproven within your

2713.19 --> 2720.9900000000002
presuppositional assumption structure

2716.01 --> 2725.2000000000003
that's what ballers do a lot you know

2720.99 --> 2729.1299999999997
that's what I don't pay somebody can

2725.2 --> 2731.8799999999997
disprove it my conceptions okay is

2729.13 --> 2735.609
somebody any proof of a physical nature

2731.88 --> 2739.809
that contrasts my thing other than but

2735.609 --> 2741.88
on earth all lights are like this and

2739.809 --> 2743.44
there is a proximity that's what we can

2741.88 --> 2745.75
test here yeah that's really nice but

2743.44 --> 2749.2000000000003
that's why it's celestial it's not the

2745.75 --> 2751.869
same like even in the general physics

2749.2 --> 2754.5099999999998
departments there's a distinct

2751.869 --> 2756.79
difference between anything terrestrial

2754.51 --> 2759.5490000000004
and anything celestial that's a given

2756.79 --> 2761.619
it's already split up in two completely

2759.549 --> 2764.589
different categories because they don't

2761.619 --> 2767.829
apply things don't seem to apply no

2764.589 --> 2771.75
matter what you presuppose about the two

2767.829 --> 2775.03
different aspects of our realm

2771.75 --> 2777.19
so yeah it's sure you can presuppose

2775.03 --> 2778.8390000000004
things but yeah if you're gonna

2777.19 --> 2781.299
presuppose then make sure you're not

2778.839 --> 2783.7
gonna presuppose based on faulty

2781.299 --> 2785.47
foundations that have already been

2783.7 --> 2788.3089999999997
disproven otherwise it's going to be

2785.47 --> 2790.24
useless because it's already disproven

2788.309 --> 2793.079
starting out with the false

2790.24 --> 2793.0789999999997
presupposition

2797.42 --> 2807.23
oh my Maui I am way too academically

2805.07 --> 2810.4900000000002
infantile when it comes to fire alarm

2807.23 --> 2819.65
going off Oh in building oh [ __ ]

2810.49 --> 2820.97
that's okay dear okay let's see you

2819.65 --> 2823.87
later guns have never run good luck

2820.97 --> 2823.87
that's weird

2843.47 --> 2850.47
yeah well Marceline if you presuppose an

2848.55 --> 2852.54
independent variable in an experiment

2850.47 --> 2856.22
that's technically not an experiment

2852.54 --> 2859.11
that's a mind experiment

2856.22 --> 2865.35
can you presuppose the globe no no you

2859.11 --> 2868.53
can't that did the baggage that comes

2865.35 --> 2869.5699999999997
with that and has already been swept off

2868.53 --> 2873.8700000000003
the table

2869.57 --> 2876.48
to no end no it does not allow you to

2873.87 --> 2879.0299999999997
presuppose a globe unless you are going

2876.48 --> 2880.92
with pure mind experiments and I do this

2879.03 --> 2883.61
all the time I can presuppose a globe

2880.92 --> 2885.63
but I'm not going to reify that

2883.61 --> 2888.9900000000002
presuppositional train of thought into

2885.63 --> 2890.55
reality you know in as long as you do

2888.99 --> 2893.0099999999998
that as long as you're clear about that

2890.55 --> 2894.36
especially to yourself then things will

2893.01 --> 2896.13
be all right but if you start to

2894.36 --> 2897.9
presuppose things like the globe and

2896.13 --> 2900.3900000000003
then forget that you're actually

2897.9 --> 2903.48
presupposing it and reifying it to

2900.39 --> 2906.06
yourself into reality yeah then it's

2903.48 --> 2912.86
gonna be [ __ ] ball hit become

2906.06 --> 2912.86
precise so it's up to you

2920.79 --> 2926.23
the Black Swan there's no curvature so

2923.89 --> 2929.83
anything that's going to suggest a ball

2926.23 --> 2935.91
or a hollow ball or anything other than

2929.83 --> 2941.02
just a flat surface arranged in any way

2935.91 --> 2942.5499999999997
it's going to just be swept off the

2941.02 --> 2944.62
table because it's already been

2942.55 --> 2949.3
disproven there is no curvature of any

2944.62 --> 2955.99
sort geometrical orientation of the

2949.3 --> 2958.0600000000004
Earth's surface is flat right and with

2955.99 --> 2960.37
that I'm gonna run out the show so

2958.06 --> 2962.77
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

2960.37 --> 2964.93
liked the show despite of being a bit

2962.77 --> 2966.46
late I thought it was good if you did

2964.93 --> 2968.1699999999996
like it then please don't forget to

2966.46 --> 2969.85

Amsterdam time every day sometimes a

2975.88 --> 2981.6
little bit late sometimes a little bit

2977.35 --> 2984.7599999999998
early yesterday I was early mm-hmm

2981.6 --> 2986.77
please also do support me through the

2984.76 --> 2989.2200000000003
paypal patreon the super chat and the

2986.77 --> 2993.43
membership system join button there

2989.22 --> 2994.24
which appreciate it and I'll be back

2993.43 --> 2999.0099999999998
tomorrow Flat Earth

2994.24 --> 3001.16
early-bird number 599 woo reaching the

2999.01 --> 3006.69
600 on Thursday

3001.16 --> 3008.2799999999997
600 hmm all right so I gonna join the

3006.69 --> 3011.0
Flat Earth debates right after this it's

3008.28 --> 3017.07
already starting up I think so

3011.0 --> 3021.42
hashtag meifa indeed Amanda young good

3017.07 --> 3025.05
servant right and until the next video

3021.42 --> 3055.4
keep it flat
