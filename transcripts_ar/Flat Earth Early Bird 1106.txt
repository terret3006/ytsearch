53.239 --> 60.718999999999994
good morning welcome to flatter's early

56.76 --> 62.16
bird number 1106 I'm your host Arwin and

60.719 --> 64.379
before I start the show please don't

62.16 --> 66.36
forget to share it on any platform you

64.379 --> 68.4
didn't fit and if you haven't already

66.36 --> 70.38
subscribe to my channel hit the Bell

68.4 --> 73.799
notification so you know when I'm going

70.38 --> 75.89999999999999
live which is normally 1pm Amsterdam

73.799 --> 78.42
time of the weekdays and 2 p.m Amsterdam

75.9 --> 80.64
time in the weekend and please also do

78.42 --> 82.5
support me through the PayPal patreon

80.64 --> 84.659

82.5 --> 86.64
system join button they'll be much

84.659 --> 88.32000000000001
appreciated

86.64 --> 93.68
so

88.32 --> 93.67999999999999
yeah starting late today I'll explain

94.68 --> 98.72000000000001
the yeah the weather is actually kind of

96.6 --> 98.72
nice

99.78 --> 103.4
it's finally some blue in there

105.24 --> 110.17999999999999
there's not doesn't seem to be any wind

114.54 --> 118.57900000000001
but it is plenty cold outside

121.02 --> 123.67999999999999
all right

130.319 --> 137.879
hey hello Jeff gashead first in chat

135.239 --> 140.4
yeah you're first

137.879 --> 142.879
right yeah I'm I'm like one and a half

140.4 --> 145.92000000000002
hours late but

142.879 --> 149.459
yeah uh Nathan already announced that

145.92 --> 152.33999999999997
he's not gonna do a flat Earth debates

149.459 --> 156.019
because he's like doing something with

152.34 --> 156.019
his family in relation to Christmas

157.98 --> 164.34
so yeah I'm just gonna

161.099 --> 166.319
do uh do my show when normally Flat

164.34 --> 167.94
Earth debates would start I'll just keep

166.319 --> 169.44
on going

167.94 --> 171.12
right

169.44 --> 175.64
and yeah

171.12 --> 175.64000000000001
I actually went out for groceries

177.12 --> 181.08
and then on the way back I got a flat

179.819 --> 183.23899999999998
tire

181.08 --> 185.72
so that's also part of the reason why

183.239 --> 185.72
I'm so late

186.3 --> 190.68
uh hello Bill Nye the science denier

188.819 --> 193.64
Wrath

190.68 --> 193.64000000000001
good to see you

196.2 --> 202.099
but yeah

198.72 --> 202.099
and finally uh

202.5 --> 209.18
got some money in and I just thought

204.78 --> 209.18
like I'm gonna just do those groceries

212.4 --> 216.299
before I start the show and then I'll

214.319 --> 219.48
start a little later because Nathan's

216.299 --> 222.48000000000002
not doing a live show anyway

219.48 --> 224.64
but then I got a flat tire somewhere

222.48 --> 226.879
and yeah I had to walk like a whole

224.64 --> 226.879
bunch

229.379 --> 234.06
and it's gonna cost me also which kind

232.5 --> 237.86
of sucks

234.06 --> 237.86
but yeah I think I'll manage

245.099 --> 247.64
right

248.879 --> 252.85999999999999
hey it's the traffic I'm arrest ahead

252.9 --> 260.23900000000003
yeah we had a call rest at me yesterday

256.979 --> 260.239
like three hours

262.86 --> 268.32
a lot of stuff

265.74 --> 271.44
did you get a chance to watch that video

268.32 --> 274.759
by the way

271.44 --> 274.759
about the cathers

285.419 --> 292.08
huh

286.86 --> 294.66
anyway yeah uh this weekend has been

292.08 --> 297.84
kind of weird to me

294.66 --> 300.3
not yeah basically not having any kind

297.84 --> 304.73999999999995
of cannabis type smokes

300.3 --> 306.68
like yeah pretty much nothing

304.74 --> 310.199
that was even on Saturday

306.68 --> 311.58
and yeah no beers

310.199 --> 314.699
and

311.58 --> 317.75899999999996
definitely feeling difference

314.699 --> 320.82
two ways

317.759 --> 323.16
one way is that yeah my intestine seems

320.82 --> 325.88
to really seem to really appreciate me

323.16 --> 325.88000000000005
not doing that

326.34 --> 330.61999999999995
so

327.84 --> 332.82
there's that and on the other hand like

330.62 --> 336.259
my mood

332.82 --> 336.259
is not super great

337.8 --> 340.52000000000004
uh

340.68 --> 346.38
then again I can't be really be sure

343.02 --> 350.15999999999997
whether it's because of that

346.38 --> 352.139
but yeah also had some really really

350.16 --> 354.12
intense dream

352.139 --> 356.039
last night

354.12 --> 360.199
and

356.039 --> 360.199
that didn't really help my mood either

368.4 --> 373.08
yeah basically going through like very

371.52 --> 376.74
clear dream and

373.08 --> 379.38
like uh whatever you call it again um

376.74 --> 382.199
Lucid type dream

379.38 --> 384.96
but yeah with my ex-girlfriend pretty

382.199 --> 386.52000000000004
much like in the peak of our

384.96 --> 388.979
relationship

386.52 --> 390.71999999999997
and when I woke up from that

388.979 --> 393.59999999999997
I was not happy

390.72 --> 396.96000000000004
also yeah in the freaking dream she left

393.6 --> 398.16
me also not like but it was all much

396.96 --> 400.31899999999996
more quick

398.16 --> 403.08000000000004
it was not

400.319 --> 405.3
like a relationship it was its typical

403.08 --> 407.88
dream Snippets

405.3 --> 409.919
but she kind of just wandered away at

407.88 --> 413.06
some point and I lost track of her very

409.919 --> 413.06
typical my way

414.38 --> 420.56
but basically getting a glimpse of like

417.9 --> 424.13899999999995
the peak of our relationship that energy

420.56 --> 426.86
and yeah waking up from that does not

424.139 --> 426.86
make me happy

427.08 --> 429.85999999999996
uh

432.96 --> 439.099
right and then flat tire on top of that

436.259 --> 439.099
well yeah

443.599 --> 453.18
also yeah there's like nobody's here

449.4 --> 455.46
like but yeah both the girl roommates I

453.18 --> 458.72
think they're just staying home like

455.46 --> 458.71999999999997
this entire week or something

466.62 --> 471.66
all right

468.479 --> 473.099
but at least yesterday I did have like a

471.66 --> 477.139
finally

473.099 --> 479.699
added a decent self-prepared meal

477.139 --> 483.12
because there was literally nothing else

479.699 --> 485.22
to eat I had it for lunch and I had it

483.12 --> 487.8
for dinner

485.22 --> 490.52000000000004
but it was very good it was

487.8 --> 490.52000000000004
yeah

490.919 --> 497.34
and so yeah I do like feel more

494.639 --> 502.639
regenerated than usual

497.34 --> 502.63899999999995
and I don't have any kind of gut issues

502.68 --> 505.40000000000003
so

506.539 --> 511.94
let's

508.58 --> 511.94
nah Wrath

514.68 --> 519.899
all the clovers think books proof the

517.26 --> 523.459
love is yeah but they don't really think

519.899 --> 523.459
they're just blabbering

524.82 --> 529.38
right

526.98 --> 532.32
I think that even using the word

529.38 --> 535.32
thinking is kind of like a

532.32 --> 538.32
an overestimation at this point

535.32 --> 540.12
they're just blabbering

538.32 --> 542.58
like they don't want to think anymore

540.12 --> 545.519
they're tired of thinking because every

542.58 --> 547.38
time they think it just results in them

545.519 --> 550.58
being utterly wrong

547.38 --> 550.58
so they don't think

559.019 --> 563.94
truth Seekers seek out now that but that

561.839 --> 566.4590000000001
doesn't really happen either wrath it's

563.94 --> 569.1
usually just like a defense response

566.459 --> 572.6999999999999
because the anti-flat earthers

569.1 --> 575.64
always keep coming after us

572.7 --> 579.0
right and yeah

575.64 --> 582.0
basically pose it a challenge which is

579.0 --> 585.56
very doable and that's why then flat

582.0 --> 585.56
earthers respond to that

585.72 --> 590.82
because it's basically an easy win

588.56 --> 593.5999999999999
or to them

590.82 --> 593.6
in general

597.62 --> 601.22
hey Matthew Hall

604.62 --> 606.8
foreign

615.5 --> 619.519
I haven't seen you in a while

628.019 --> 632.04
what anti-flatter or anti-vac what the

631.32 --> 634.2
hell

632.04 --> 636.38
now those two you don't really compare

634.2 --> 636.38
them

641.88 --> 648.0
hope I'm feeling better today yeah math

643.74 --> 650.76
y'all yeah yesterday oh it's a kind of

648.0 --> 652.079
annoying show really in my memory I

650.76 --> 653.88
don't know maybe it turned out kind of

652.079 --> 657.42
okay I didn't watch it back

653.88 --> 659.279
but yeah it really was my rib it was it

657.42 --> 663.12
I'm yeah

659.279 --> 667.56
so I kind of managed to

663.12 --> 670.98
just like get a good shower and

667.56 --> 673.14
like take it easy and really focus on

670.98 --> 674.399
just like moving around as much as I

673.14 --> 677.399
could

674.399 --> 679.92
like because yeah that kind of massages

677.399 --> 682.079
it back to normal

679.92 --> 685.74
and a good dinner and all that and it

682.079 --> 688.38
did help so it's now completely gone

685.74 --> 690.54
very happy about that

688.38 --> 692.459
also that it didn't turn out to be

690.54 --> 694.38
something else right

692.459 --> 696.3
because that would have been

694.38 --> 698.22
scary

696.3 --> 701.3
sort of

698.22 --> 701.3000000000001
a clutch

707.24 --> 713.279
lowers think the laws of physics

710.459 --> 717.1999999999999
and at the Carmen line

713.279 --> 717.2
then the pseudoscience start well

718.62 --> 721.4590000000001
no

722.88 --> 728.3389999999999
they're just assuming

725.76 --> 730.92
that the gradient keeps on going and

728.339 --> 733.2
going even though you can't practically

730.92 --> 738.42
demonstrate anything like that

733.2 --> 740.94
if you build like a micro container like

738.42 --> 742.74
any gradient inside there is not going

740.94 --> 745.8000000000001
to divide up

742.74 --> 747.0
with like massive amounts of super low

745.8 --> 751.019
pressure

747.0 --> 753.36
well next to relatively high pressure

751.019 --> 755.639
with it with a layer that you can't

753.36 --> 757.38
simulate there's no way to simulate it

755.639 --> 761.04
in a computer

757.38 --> 764.18
or in an actual physical situation right

761.04 --> 764.18
that's the real issue

768.36 --> 775.38
but they just believe it because yeah

770.94 --> 776.7
the CGI and all that right CGI in the

775.38 --> 779.42
last

776.7 --> 779.4200000000001
80 years

780.06 --> 785.6999999999999
it all just like plays into that like

783.18 --> 787.7399999999999
yeah it is possible look see we got the

785.7 --> 789.839
CDI

787.74 --> 793.38
you can get used to that

789.839 --> 797.0400000000001
you can start making up excuses

793.38 --> 801.2
why it should be like that yourself

797.04 --> 801.1999999999999
right Ballers make up excuses

801.779 --> 805.279
that's the standard approach

805.32 --> 811.1600000000001
they can't really dig into the heavy

808.5 --> 811.16
physics

811.74 --> 817.2
so yeah either move away

814.68 --> 819.8389999999999
or just make up a flimsy quick excuse

817.2 --> 823.9200000000001
which is like blatantly broken to

819.839 --> 826.9200000000001
anybody that pays any critical attention

823.92 --> 826.92
ah

840.54 --> 848.12
right but like even wrath even the

844.74 --> 848.12
Carmen light is like a

848.22 --> 854.4200000000001
it's more like a concept like none of it

851.399 --> 854.42
actually does anything

861.839 --> 867.9590000000001
right I mean is the Carmen line the line

865.199 --> 868.8599999999999
also where supposedly gravity starts to

867.959 --> 872.1199999999999
decrease

868.86 --> 872.12
not sure could be

874.26 --> 878.72
not that that actually happens of course

879.66 --> 886.12
If gravity were to be a force

883.279 --> 889.169
which it officially isn't

886.12 --> 889.169
[Music]

894.54 --> 901.139
a cubic Footwear expense with vertical

898.019 --> 905.339
change pressure is just the effect

901.139 --> 907.199
vertical change is to go what

905.339 --> 910.2600000000001
I don't know what you're talking about

907.199 --> 913.38
wrath but I do know that in the physical

910.26 --> 915.42
world with containers you can actually

913.38 --> 917.16
create gradients

915.42 --> 919.4399999999999
with

917.16 --> 922.38
yeah Heat

919.44 --> 927.0600000000001
and cold elements

922.38 --> 928.8
if you just take a self-contained

927.06 --> 931.079
volume of air

928.8 --> 933.019
and you put heat elements on one side

931.079 --> 935.88
and and cold elements on the other side

933.019 --> 938.54
then there will start to form a natural

935.88 --> 938.54
gradient

947.94 --> 953.24
okay rest that that's gross hey Tony

950.699 --> 953.24
Whitcomb

957.06 --> 961.8
yeah there's no flat Earth debates today

959.16 --> 964.8199999999999
so that's why I'm starting really late

961.8 --> 964.8199999999999
and I'll just keep going

973.62 --> 977.779
pressure is made by the container

975.36 --> 977.779
correct

978.54 --> 983.8199999999999
that's right and you can have a pressure

981.06 --> 987.66
gradient within a container but it can

983.82 --> 991.139
only be a pressure gradient because of

987.66 --> 994.199
the volume of the container

991.139 --> 998.72
right and that's like that's basically

994.199 --> 998.7199999999999
yeah that's mathematical in a way

999.899 --> 1005.86
like the gradient is a pattern

1003.199 --> 1010.3389999999999
it's always a pattern and that pattern

1005.86 --> 1012.74
cannot ever ever in any circumstances be

1010.339 --> 1015.5
demonstrated to become

1012.74 --> 1019.16
very high pressure

1015.5 --> 1022.899
like over small distances decreasing

1019.16 --> 1027.6789999999999
decreasing a lot until it's like

1022.899 --> 1030.86
100th and then go on another billion

1027.679 --> 1032.3600000000001
times that same volume with the super

1030.86 --> 1035.839
low pressure

1032.36 --> 1040.78
that is absolutely in in demonstratable

1035.839 --> 1040.78
in demonstrable that can never happen

1041.299 --> 1046.579
right there's always going to be like a

1043.76 --> 1050.74
linear division between

1046.579 --> 1050.74
a distance in the container

1051.26 --> 1057.86
and cannot like be like

1054.919 --> 1059.0
super steady and then rock it up into

1057.86 --> 1062.32
eternity

1059.0 --> 1062.32
that just can't happen

1066.98 --> 1070.24
if height yeah

1076.28 --> 1080.4189999999999
there is only vertical change no

1078.5 --> 1083.44
pressure what

1080.419 --> 1083.44
what does that mean

1088.4 --> 1094.299
what do you mean no pressure

1091.58 --> 1094.299
what

1096.62 --> 1100.9399999999998
I mean if you're gonna say yeah the

1098.299 --> 1103.76
gradiation is vertical okay

1100.94 --> 1104.96
but no pressure what do you mean no

1103.76 --> 1107.48
pressure

1104.96 --> 1109.8400000000001
it's all pressure the gradient is

1107.48 --> 1109.84
pressure

1119.78 --> 1125.32
the R value of the carbon line oh God

1132.2 --> 1139.1000000000001
we don't have a container

1136.1 --> 1139.1
really

1139.22 --> 1143.74
so you're just gonna call it something

1141.38 --> 1143.74
else

1143.96 --> 1148.46
or just say okay yeah we can't have

1146.24 --> 1151.76
fresh without a container so we're gonna

1148.46 --> 1153.98
use another terminology to express the

1151.76 --> 1157.34
same thing like okay we're just not

1153.98 --> 1160.22
gonna call it pressure anymore

1157.34 --> 1161.539
that's kind of pathetic

1160.22 --> 1164.679
Wrath

1161.539 --> 1164.679
can't be serious

1168.02 --> 1172.66
I'm kind of surprised here I thought

1169.64 --> 1172.66
you'd well

1173.84 --> 1178.9399999999998
I kind of thought that you were a flat

1175.64 --> 1182.179
earther but I guess

1178.94 --> 1184.3400000000001
or maybe your your Spurs chemo earther

1182.179 --> 1185.7800000000002
or something

1184.34 --> 1189.28
I don't know

1185.78 --> 1189.28
but yeah it's weird

1197.36 --> 1200.36
foreign

1207.62 --> 1212.36
what is the difference between air

1209.539 --> 1215.84
pressure and density

1212.36 --> 1218.1789999999999
well air pressure is gas pressure

1215.84 --> 1220.52
it has a density

1218.179 --> 1223.7
density however applies to more than

1220.52 --> 1225.799
just gas it applies to liquids and

1223.7 --> 1227.419
solids in all the other states

1225.799 --> 1229.58
that's the difference

1227.419 --> 1232.159
they're not the same thing they're not

1229.58 --> 1235.46
the same aspect

1232.159 --> 1237.919
pressure is caused by gas

1235.46 --> 1239.419
it's its natural tendency to expand in

1237.919 --> 1241.3400000000001
all directions to fill the available

1239.419 --> 1245.2990000000002
volume of the container

1241.34 --> 1246.32
now of course it being matter it has a

1245.299 --> 1248.4189999999999
density

1246.32 --> 1249.98
that doesn't mean that pressure is

1248.419 --> 1253.039
density

1249.98 --> 1256.159
right because a solid rock

1253.039 --> 1258.3799999999999
doesn't expand in all directions to fill

1256.159 --> 1260.96
the available volume because it's a rock

1258.38 --> 1264.2800000000002
it doesn't do that so it doesn't have

1260.96 --> 1264.28
that same pressure

1270.44 --> 1275.799
what is volume

1273.08 --> 1275.799
what

1275.84 --> 1279.52
the [ __ ] are you laughing about

1306.26 --> 1313.94
volume is available space

1310.34 --> 1316.82
it's room I mean like what kind of a

1313.94 --> 1319.3400000000001
like is that a philosophical question

1316.82 --> 1322.1
or is that a physics question like what

1319.34 --> 1324.32
the hell what are you what are you doing

1322.1 --> 1327.039
we don't have to you don't need a

1324.32 --> 1327.039
specific volume

1327.559 --> 1332.2
the only thing you need is a limited

1329.9 --> 1332.2
volume

1333.799 --> 1336.22
right

1336.32 --> 1342.5
because of gradation pattern the

1339.44 --> 1346.46
gradation pattern points

1342.5 --> 1348.14
at well you could basically deduce from

1346.46 --> 1350.0
the gradiation of the gas pressure on

1348.14 --> 1353.539
Earth roughly

1350.0 --> 1355.58
where it's where the container limit is

1353.539 --> 1357.679
very likely to be

1355.58 --> 1359.539
but it's never going to be precise

1357.679 --> 1360.94
because we don't have all the data we

1359.539 --> 1363.44
don't have the exact temperature

1360.94 --> 1365.9
influences that causes the gradient in

1363.44 --> 1368.6000000000001
the first place and it's all dynamic

1365.9 --> 1371.48
system it's very hard to deduce

1368.6 --> 1376.6999999999998
but we can definitely deduce that there

1371.48 --> 1382.96
isn't a Google Plex meters a volume

1376.7 --> 1382.96
above us we can definitely deduce that

1385.46 --> 1389.419
okay

1386.919 --> 1392.659
I'm we're not ready for this what oh

1389.419 --> 1396.38
you're the special boy oh oh we're not

1392.659 --> 1400.1000000000001
ready to be initiated by your weird

1396.38 --> 1403.7600000000002
mind twist and rearranging

1400.1 --> 1408.62
words in order to avoid

1403.76 --> 1411.28
physics consequences no no you are just

1408.62 --> 1411.28
blabbering

1422.96 --> 1428.8400000000001
I need a specific volume well yeah it is

1426.5 --> 1431.0
a specific for you if if you're trying

1428.84 --> 1434.8999999999999
to

1431.0 --> 1437.84
point out that yeah the volume of the

1434.9 --> 1440.9
container contains space here

1437.84 --> 1444.9189999999999
is not varying that's for sure yeah

1440.9 --> 1448.539
because then in linear relation the

1444.919 --> 1448.539
gradient would also Flex

1449.059 --> 1454.82
Warp it would basically cause massive

1452.48 --> 1458.84
depressurization if the volume certainly

1454.82 --> 1462.08
increased of the container

1458.84 --> 1465.1999999999998
or an old school flat earther well old

1462.08 --> 1467.299
school flat earthers don't rearrange

1465.2 --> 1471.2
words

1467.299 --> 1473.6589999999999
to try and avoid physics issues

1471.2 --> 1476.6000000000001
that's just an idiot

1473.659 --> 1479.14
or a fantasist and that's fine but

1476.6 --> 1482.12
you're not blowing our mind you're just

1479.14 --> 1484.6000000000001
blatantly wandering off into Fantasy

1482.12 --> 1484.6
Land here

1485.6 --> 1491.6
right all these terminologies all these

1489.02 --> 1495.2
formulas yeah we've heard about it all

1491.6 --> 1496.76
right I don't really work that much with

1495.2 --> 1499.5800000000002
math

1496.76 --> 1503.02
like that form of physics of like oh put

1499.58 --> 1507.1399999999999
the formula there no I just visualize it

1503.02 --> 1509.779
I explain it that's how I do things I

1507.14 --> 1512.779
don't really work with math I just make

1509.779 --> 1516.44
you understand through communication

1512.779 --> 1518.36
directly that's how I do it because I

1516.44 --> 1521.9
get it I really get it

1518.36 --> 1526.1589999999999
right it's I've spent five years on this

1521.9 --> 1527.539
as in barely have any other life outside

1526.159 --> 1530.2990000000002
of it

1527.539 --> 1533.86
right no social life

1530.299 --> 1533.86
seriously none

1534.86 --> 1540.6999999999998
I don't have a family or anything

1537.38 --> 1540.7
which in a way I would

1540.86 --> 1547.8799999999999
so yeah I I yeah I've been studying and

1545.12 --> 1549.559
physics since it yeah I consider it kind

1547.88 --> 1554.179
of my profession through the Flat Earth

1549.559 --> 1557.539
debate and I do I need to challenge it

1554.179 --> 1559.8200000000002
and then I get all poo pooed at first or

1557.539 --> 1561.919
or I get good compliments if I

1559.82 --> 1564.98
discovered something interesting

1561.919 --> 1569.1200000000001
I got a paradox named after me right

1564.98 --> 1570.5
yeah that's because that's my personal

1569.12 --> 1573.559
profession

1570.5 --> 1577.1
to understand it and to translate it

1573.559 --> 1579.44
into direct explanation in opposition to

1577.1 --> 1581.24
just a bunch of mathematical thinking

1579.44 --> 1582.919
based formulas

1581.24 --> 1585.5
that's what I do

1582.919 --> 1586.94
and it really helps me to totally

1585.5 --> 1590.919
understand

1586.94 --> 1590.919
right to really get it

1593.179 --> 1598.7
because the formulas have not really

1595.4 --> 1601.279
helped me in the past

1598.7 --> 1603.0800000000002
right if you don't understand exactly

1601.279 --> 1605.44
what it all stands for it's kind of

1603.08 --> 1605.4399999999998
useless

1607.039 --> 1611.6
so it's much more important to really

1608.779 --> 1612.74
understand like what it what it even

1611.6 --> 1614.48
means

1612.74 --> 1617.08
anyway

1614.48 --> 1617.08
uh

1628.12 --> 1634.1789999999999
oh that was quick

1630.559 --> 1634.1789999999999
my back is fixed

1636.22 --> 1640.94
38 Euros

1639.26 --> 1643.279
but yeah it's because like the whole

1640.94 --> 1646.0
back tire the outside tire was kind of

1643.279 --> 1646.0
like worn out

1647.179 --> 1651.74
right so please donate to my PayPal it's

1650.0 --> 1654.32
not like I have

1651.74 --> 1657.6200000000001
a surplus if you know what I mean

1654.32 --> 1660.34
right anyway I like this conversation

1657.62 --> 1660.34
though

1663.919 --> 1667.0590000000002
right so ref

1667.88 --> 1673.46
you're obviously not

1670.72 --> 1675.98
reconsidering what you're doing so could

1673.46 --> 1678.76
you elaborate onto what you're trying to

1675.98 --> 1678.76
explain here

1681.08 --> 1687.1999999999998
it's like this weird vertical

1684.559 --> 1689.84
instead of pressure and all that and

1687.2 --> 1692.299
like what is your point I'm getting I'm

1689.84 --> 1694.58
kind of curious as to like

1692.299 --> 1697.059
the train of thinking where are you

1694.58 --> 1697.059
getting this

1699.62 --> 1706.039
and what's up with the specific volume

1701.86 --> 1709.1589999999999
why relevant to what

1706.039 --> 1713.32
what is a specific volume relevant to

1709.159 --> 1713.3200000000002
in order to establish anything here

1715.76 --> 1718.179
what

1719.36 --> 1722.32
this

1720.919 --> 1727.48
is

1722.32 --> 1727.48
contains itself are you serious

1729.02 --> 1736.76
it's how is it supposed to do that you

1732.08 --> 1740.12
do you know what gas pressure is

1736.76 --> 1742.64
how it is defined how it is calculated

1740.12 --> 1743.539
the pressure moves in all directions and

1742.64 --> 1746.0590000000002
then

1743.539 --> 1750.3799999999999
bumps into other gas

1746.059 --> 1752.84
or into the Container wall and that then

1750.38 --> 1754.64
the moving in all directions evens out

1752.84 --> 1756.1999999999998
with the rest of the gas and the

1754.64 --> 1759.679
container wall

1756.2 --> 1762.44
it cannot it requires the container wall

1759.679 --> 1765.799
or it just keeps expanding that's not

1762.44 --> 1769.1000000000001
reality that's idiotic

1765.799 --> 1772.46
that's you're not a flat earther

1769.1 --> 1773.899
like this is even Beyond dielectric

1772.46 --> 1777.2
nonsense

1773.899 --> 1779.36
this is just straight ball or lunacy I

1777.2 --> 1782.44
don't know who's that you're not a

1779.36 --> 1782.4399999999998
you're not a flat earther

1783.02 --> 1787.76
I've never heard a flatter claim

1785.0 --> 1791.72
anything like that I mean not even like

1787.76 --> 1794.179
Ali B or someone like that who's like a

1791.72 --> 1795.32
really he can get very loopy with his

1794.179 --> 1801.14
ideas

1795.32 --> 1803.36
right no no harm I mean you're okay but

1801.14 --> 1806.14
like I've never heard a flat earther say

1803.36 --> 1810.9399999999998
anything like that gasp

1806.14 --> 1810.94
contains itself that that's

1811.399 --> 1817.2199999999998
that's absolutely uh yeah

1814.94 --> 1820.1000000000001
that's where where kiwi starts to play

1817.22 --> 1822.26
his uh car crash sound bite because

1820.1 --> 1823.6399999999999
that's just a straight out car crash

1822.26 --> 1825.74
that's

1823.64 --> 1827.659
you don't understand what pressure is if

1825.74 --> 1829.64
you're gonna say that gas is going to

1827.659 --> 1832.3600000000001
contain itself that's absolutely

1829.64 --> 1832.3600000000001
ridiculous

1834.2 --> 1840.679
right unless unless unless you're

1838.22 --> 1843.08
dealing with a looping space ah isn't

1840.679 --> 1846.8600000000001
that funny remember all that silly old

1843.08 --> 1850.279
Arwen with his stupid ridiculous looping

1846.86 --> 1853.58
ideas oh super smart people out there

1850.279 --> 1855.919
that think Arwin is so ridiculous for

1853.58 --> 1859.279
considering that space itself might be

1855.919 --> 1862.76
looping how ridiculous

1859.279 --> 1865.22
I mean you can't imagine it you can

1862.76 --> 1866.899
basically have a normal inquiry based

1865.22 --> 1868.279
conversation about it without getting

1866.899 --> 1871.8799999999999
triggered

1868.279 --> 1874.039
right so you just shut up until I

1871.88 --> 1875.0590000000002
somebody points out how ridiculous they

1874.039 --> 1877.76
think

1875.059 --> 1882.22
the looping idea is and then you all

1877.76 --> 1882.22
just blabber on all of you

1882.44 --> 1887.6000000000001
pretty much every smart person I know

1885.5 --> 1889.46
yeah

1887.6 --> 1892.9399999999998
yeah I'm still kind of pissed off about

1889.46 --> 1896.179
that right but yeah yeah if

1892.94 --> 1898.76
volume is limited which is what

1896.179 --> 1900.6200000000001
containment requires a limitation to the

1898.76 --> 1902.6
volume right if there's no limitation to

1900.62 --> 1905.2399999999998
the volume the gas is not gonna just

1902.6 --> 1907.9399999999998
stay there it's gonna expand within the

1905.24 --> 1912.08
available volume but if there is no more

1907.94 --> 1915.3200000000002
volume because it Loops in on itself

1912.08 --> 1918.74
then yeah then the gas will contain

1915.32 --> 1921.62
itself within the parameters of the loop

1918.74 --> 1924.019
because it can't Loop up to down because

1921.62 --> 1927.5
we have a solid floor

1924.019 --> 1929.72
right so yeah there would then be a

1927.5 --> 1932.299
solid floor you can't just go up and

1929.72 --> 1933.919
then end up through the solid floor in

1932.299 --> 1935.24
the same space

1933.919 --> 1937.94
right

1935.24 --> 1940.58
horizontally

1937.94 --> 1944.48
in a looping setup yeah

1940.58 --> 1946.6399999999999
gas would just press on itself on the

1944.48 --> 1949.58
sides there would be no physical

1946.64 --> 1951.74
container wall required there

1949.58 --> 1952.6999999999998
but yeah that's not the case upward

1951.74 --> 1956.059
though

1952.7 --> 1960.3990000000001
that would absolutely have to be at best

1956.059 --> 1960.399
at minimum a flat top

1960.86 --> 1968.539
so yeah there is no conceivable way no

1965.799 --> 1970.899
conceivable way wrath that you were

1968.539 --> 1970.899
correct

1981.14 --> 1985.94
what

1982.72 --> 1989.799
Graham's gas law of diffusion what

1985.94 --> 1989.799
that doesn't ring any bells

1995.299 --> 1998.2
oh my God

1998.62 --> 2004.4189999999999
[Music]

2001.86 --> 2007.12
yeah atmosphere because there is no

2004.419 --> 2010.419
atmosphere atmosphere

2007.12 --> 2011.26
it literally translates to sphere-shaped

2010.419 --> 2015.279
air

2011.26 --> 2017.8799999999999
that's a globe construct there is no

2015.279 --> 2017.88
atmosphere

2018.36 --> 2023.62
atmosphere

2020.159 --> 2027.279
is the fictional construct of gas

2023.62 --> 2030.279
pressure very concentrated form sticking

2027.279 --> 2033.279
to a ball versus a

2030.279 --> 2035.799
seemingly endless amount of volume of

2033.279 --> 2039.6
super low pressure that's atmosphere

2035.799 --> 2039.6
it's a fictional construct

2044.08 --> 2049.72
oh you don't care about etymology

2047.14 --> 2051.28
oh well if you don't care about the

2049.72 --> 2053.6789999999996
meaning of words

2051.28 --> 2057.52
well then you don't have an argument

2053.679 --> 2060.94
because yeah words have meaning

2057.52 --> 2063.72
for a reason right to have logical

2060.94 --> 2067.119
consistency to actually have it rooted

2063.72 --> 2068.7999999999997
in things that are always going to be

2067.119 --> 2070.179
the way they are

2068.8 --> 2072.3390000000004
right

2070.179 --> 2074.2000000000003
if you don't care about etymology then

2072.339 --> 2076.119
you don't care about the meaning of

2074.2 --> 2078.5989999999997
words that you're just blabbering like

2076.119 --> 2078.599
an idiot

2083.919 --> 2090.54
the weight of the air above no the air

2087.46 --> 2090.54
doesn't have weight

2091.899 --> 2097.2999999999997
it has a density it doesn't have weight

2094.359 --> 2101.5789999999997
air doesn't have weight

2097.3 --> 2101.579
it has pressure it doesn't have weight

2116.76 --> 2123.46
yeah it doesn't have weight [ __ ] it

2120.099 --> 2126.94
doesn't have weights yeah you know what

2123.46 --> 2129.94
weight is huh huh [ __ ] [ __ ] you

2126.94 --> 2134.2000000000003
know what weight is yeah

2129.94 --> 2137.68
it's relative density

2134.2 --> 2141.8199999999997
something matter any form of matter in

2137.68 --> 2145.06
relation to air surrounding it as a

2141.82 --> 2146.44
medium air doesn't have weight because

2145.06 --> 2147.7
air

2146.44 --> 2151.359
right

2147.7 --> 2153.7599999999998
is part of the formula weight is

2151.359 --> 2156.5789999999997
actually air weight

2153.76 --> 2159.579
it's something weight

2156.579 --> 2163.42
pressure deduction based on an air

2159.579 --> 2166.0600000000004
medium that's weight that's right it's a

2163.42 --> 2168.82
convention created based on relative

2166.06 --> 2172.7799999999997
density in an air medium so you can't

2168.82 --> 2175.98
weigh air because it is the medium

2172.78 --> 2175.98
it's ridiculous

2181.54 --> 2186.339
yeah resort to insults indeed because

2183.82 --> 2188.2000000000003
this has been talked about to know and

2186.339 --> 2190.24
you stupid idiot

2188.2 --> 2193.0
we've discussed this on the Flat Earth

2190.24 --> 2194.7999999999997
debate and here on my show in like the

2193.0 --> 2196.18
last four years

2194.8 --> 2197.98
a lot

2196.18 --> 2199.96
you think you're the first one to bring

2197.98 --> 2203.68
this [ __ ] up

2199.96 --> 2206.7400000000002
air doesn't have weight because weight

2203.68 --> 2209.859
is air weight which means relative

2206.74 --> 2214.66
density this equilibrium pressure of

2209.859 --> 2216.7599999999998
something in a medium of air you idiots

2214.66 --> 2220.839
that's what it is

2216.76 --> 2222.7000000000003
you can't weigh air weight is a

2220.839 --> 2225.52
convention based on relative density

2222.7 --> 2227.8199999999997
this equilibrium pressure in a medium of

2225.52 --> 2227.82
air

2231.7 --> 2236.56
giving you a timeout it's your stupid

2234.4 --> 2239.38
[ __ ] smileys

2236.56 --> 2242.94
weight is a force no it isn't

2239.38 --> 2242.94
you're a blabbering idiot

2251.859 --> 2255.7
weight is relative density this

2254.14 --> 2258.16
equilibrium

2255.7 --> 2260.68
pressure deduction

2258.16 --> 2263.74
that's what it is that's how it is

2260.68 --> 2266.3799999999997
effectively calculated right weight you

2263.74 --> 2268.4199999999996
calculated how through pressure what

2266.38 --> 2270.579
causes the pressure relative density

2268.42 --> 2273.76
this equilibrium

2270.579 --> 2275.1400000000003
right something is denser than the

2273.76 --> 2278.38
medium it is in

2275.14 --> 2280.66
but yeah it's not gonna like oh liquid

2278.38 --> 2282.2200000000003
might but a solid thing won't it's not

2280.66 --> 2285.8799999999997
going to like expand in all directions

2282.22 --> 2288.9399999999996
or flow down

2285.88 --> 2291.579
now it's gonna sit there

2288.94 --> 2293.2000000000003
and it still is in this equilibrium with

2291.579 --> 2296.04
its medium

2293.2 --> 2299.68
so that then translates into pressure

2296.04 --> 2301.839
and the pressure can then be deduced on

2299.68 --> 2304.06
the scale and then you get a reading of

2301.839 --> 2305.5
weight

2304.06 --> 2308.82
yeah

2305.5 --> 2308.82
that's how that works

2315.339 --> 2323.56
and I'm not gonna go with you down that

2318.099 --> 2327.1600000000003
stupid little hamster treadmill of 2015.

2323.56 --> 2330.7599999999998
with your stupid formulas

2327.16 --> 2333.5789999999997
that are all wrong gravity isn't a force

2330.76 --> 2337.3
officially it can't cause anything

2333.579 --> 2340.5
it's definitely not gonna be proven by

2337.3 --> 2343.6600000000003
the convention of weight that you

2340.5 --> 2346.3
mistakingly tie into the formula with

2343.66 --> 2349.5989999999997
gravity because Newton did that yeah

2346.3 --> 2352.079
none of his formulas are actually proven

2349.599 --> 2355.3590000000004
his entire concept

2352.079 --> 2358.0
excludes gas behavior except for

2355.359 --> 2361.2999999999997
friction of objects when they go through

2358.0 --> 2364.42
it yeah it completely ignores it that's

2361.3 --> 2367.1800000000003
officially recognized you just didn't

2364.42 --> 2370.96
pay attention in school

2367.18 --> 2374.3199999999997
you just Echo the blabbering on of bald

2370.96 --> 2378.119
hearts and their stupid Gravity Force

2374.32 --> 2378.119
religion that's what you're doing

2386.079 --> 2389.76
yeah

2387.579 --> 2389.76
foreign

2392.859 --> 2397.18
you can take five minutes to think about

2394.9 --> 2400.06
it if you're gonna blabber on with your

2397.18 --> 2403.06
stupid Smileys if I see one more row of

2400.06 --> 2405.7599999999998
those stupid laughing smileys

2403.06 --> 2407.38
yeah that proves how much pain you're in

2405.76 --> 2409.6600000000003
because they're actually an expression

2407.38 --> 2412.599
of baller pain if I see it one more time

2409.66 --> 2414.8799999999997
you're immediately banned

2412.599 --> 2417.6600000000003
because I'm not gonna tolerate that kind

2414.88 --> 2417.6600000000003
of squirting here

2418.18 --> 2424.02
like that's anti-flat Earth or behavior

2420.64 --> 2424.02
I don't tolerate that

2425.619 --> 2429.1800000000003
go squirt somewhere else

2432.4 --> 2435.06
Jerry

2436.24 --> 2440.74
well you could

2437.98 --> 2443.319
but it's not gonna make an impact

2440.74 --> 2445.1189999999997
it's just gonna temporarily cause a

2443.319 --> 2447.88
pressure

2445.119 --> 2449.859
increase local pressure differential

2447.88 --> 2452.859
that's going to make all the air

2449.859 --> 2454.96
surrounding it move aside to equalize

2452.859 --> 2456.4
that pressure differential so you're

2454.96 --> 2458.56
going to feel some slight pressure

2456.4 --> 2461.92
probably at the top of your fist very

2458.56 --> 2464.74
slight you might not even sense it

2461.92 --> 2468.04
and then you will feel the the air

2464.74 --> 2471.7
around you moving

2468.04 --> 2473.319
but it's yeah it's not gonna increase

2471.7 --> 2477.8999999999996
a lot

2473.319 --> 2477.9
because yeah air gets out of the way

2484.9 --> 2492.06
right there just has to be just a tiny

2488.56 --> 2495.64
tiny little amount of pressure increase

2492.06 --> 2499.2599999999998
and everything starts moving succinctly

2495.64 --> 2502.1189999999997
aside why because all the gas pressure

2499.26 --> 2506.98
is all pressing against each other

2502.119 --> 2509.7400000000002
constantly it seems sort of uniformly

2506.98 --> 2512.619
right although yeah the dynamic system

2509.74 --> 2514.319
that goes all over the place but it's

2512.619 --> 2517.54
always always

2514.319 --> 2520.72
all together pressuring pressing on each

2517.54 --> 2522.64
other constantly so if just one little

2520.72 --> 2523.74
bit of pressure increases somewhere

2522.64 --> 2527.2
locally

2523.74 --> 2529.8999999999996
everything will immediately adapt to

2527.2 --> 2530.859
that right and we experience that as

2529.9 --> 2534.839
wind

2530.859 --> 2534.839
it's just immediately gonna do that

2535.54 --> 2540.22
just have to be a tiny amount of extra

2538.3 --> 2543.579
pressure and everything will respond

2540.22 --> 2546.2799999999997
because that's what gas does

2543.579 --> 2548.44
it doesn't take impact

2546.28 --> 2551.38
unless it's like

2548.44 --> 2553.78
super extreme

2551.38 --> 2556.48
speeds

2553.78 --> 2558.8190000000004
and then the pressure is just yeah won't

2556.48 --> 2560.619
get the time to basically expand in all

2558.819 --> 2562.66
directions then it will dramatically

2560.619 --> 2564.28
increase locally and then you'll feel

2562.66 --> 2565.8999999999996
the impact right

2564.28 --> 2568.0
it's just like when you're going like

2565.9 --> 2569.92
insanely fast

2568.0 --> 2573.42
in in a car

2569.92 --> 2576.819
with an open roof you're gonna feel like

2573.42 --> 2578.6800000000003
yeah that's because the gas doesn't get

2576.819 --> 2581.2
the time to get out of the way so the

2578.68 --> 2583.74
pressure is going to increase more

2581.2 --> 2583.74
right

2615.7 --> 2620.7999999999997
they explained their claims yeah but

2618.52 --> 2622.78
they do that all hello uppercut they do

2620.8 --> 2624.819
that all the time

2622.78 --> 2627.1800000000003
and it's wrong it's wrong every time

2624.819 --> 2629.38
they just follow the textbook

2627.18 --> 2633.339
misunderstandings right they got a whole

2629.38 --> 2635.6800000000003
library of fallacies that all Interlink

2633.339 --> 2637.96
and the only thing that it requires is

2635.68 --> 2640.54
that nobody points out that every single

2637.96 --> 2643.06
part of it is completely wrong and then

2640.54 --> 2645.94
it all works seemingly right that's what

2643.06 --> 2648.64
they're doing it's a religion

2645.94 --> 2651.819
just you have to go with it

2648.64 --> 2654.339
no matter how ridiculous it all is and

2651.819 --> 2656.859
that's the only way it works

2654.339 --> 2660.339
and then just scattergun you with that

2656.859 --> 2663.339
right so one technique of anti-flat

2660.339 --> 2665.7999999999997
earthers is to basically

2663.339 --> 2666.599
move from one argument to the other and

2665.8 --> 2670.1800000000003
then

2666.599 --> 2673.42
drain the flat earther because they

2670.18 --> 2675.94
could a lot of them not everybody but a

2673.42 --> 2677.8
lot of them can basically respond to

2675.94 --> 2680.859
every single argument

2677.8 --> 2682.9
but they just yeah for just one stupid

2680.859 --> 2686.56
little sentence you have to like spend

2682.9 --> 2688.3
two to five minutes explaining

2686.56 --> 2689.74
in the hopes that the other will

2688.3 --> 2692.44
actually pay attention and they want

2689.74 --> 2694.72
they will just instead immediately move

2692.44 --> 2697.18
on to the next fallacy that you then

2694.72 --> 2699.8999999999996
have to explain so you're gonna get

2697.18 --> 2699.8999999999996
tired out

2700.66 --> 2705.3999999999996
that's what they do they don't actually

2703.359 --> 2707.2599999999998
respond to anything

2705.4 --> 2708.88
hello Professor philbel thanks for the

2707.26 --> 2712.44
PayPal donation

2708.88 --> 2712.44
I really appreciated that

2726.3 --> 2731.02
right and what I just described is

2729.16 --> 2733.18
called scatter gunning

2731.02 --> 2734.64
one to the other

2733.18 --> 2738.0989999999997
day

2734.64 --> 2740.859
very easy to fire off it takes like

2738.099 --> 2743.38
minutes to respond to that and even if

2740.859 --> 2744.2799999999997
you don't get the time to respond to it

2743.38 --> 2746.619
because

2744.28 --> 2749.1400000000003
the baller is going to scatter gun you

2746.619 --> 2751.06
with the next question in your mind

2749.14 --> 2753.339
you're gonna go through all the

2751.06 --> 2756.04
processes in order to potentially

2753.339 --> 2759.339
prepare explaining it right

2756.04 --> 2761.5
that's also tiresome so even if you

2759.339 --> 2764.0789999999997
don't get the time to respond you will

2761.5 --> 2766.18
develop a headache when an anti-flat

2764.079 --> 2768.3390000000004
earther starts scatter gunning you very

2766.18 --> 2771.04
rapidly even if it takes a very short

2768.339 --> 2772.599
time or just one fallacy after that it's

2771.04 --> 2774.819
going to give you a headache because in

2772.599 --> 2776.1400000000003
your mind you're going through why it's

2774.819 --> 2777.94
all wrong

2776.14 --> 2780.7
even though you don't get the time to

2777.94 --> 2785.079
explain it it still costs energy so they

2780.7 --> 2787.4199999999996
just drain you with fallacies

2785.079 --> 2789.54
scatter gunning

2787.42 --> 2789.54
thank you

2796.2 --> 2802.48
right yeah I'm uh

2799.66 --> 2806.56
doing my show a lot longer than usual

2802.48 --> 2809.68
again because Flat Earth debates is not

2806.56 --> 2812.92
not going live today

2809.68 --> 2815.5
Nathan is on a family outing

2812.92 --> 2817.54
Christmas related he said they were

2815.5 --> 2821.38
going to meet Santa at low

2817.54 --> 2824.819
right so I'm I started the show very

2821.38 --> 2824.819
late and I'm just gonna keep on going

2832.0 --> 2837.7
so yeah because of that I also expect a

2835.24 --> 2840.16
lot of anti-flatter there's some Ballers

2837.7 --> 2842.2599999999998
to pop up in my chat and share their

2840.16 --> 2845.819
pain as they normally would be used to

2842.26 --> 2845.8190000000004
doing at the Flat Earth baits

2866.2 --> 2873.839
no George Sanford pressurized air in a

2869.92 --> 2873.839
container indeed has wait no it doesn't

2877.66 --> 2884.7999999999997
it's only in when it's liquefied and no

2880.9 --> 2886.839
longer a gas that it gains weight

2884.8 --> 2890.079
you're wrong

2886.839 --> 2892.7799999999997
I can't believe I missed that

2890.079 --> 2895.3590000000004
seeing it right there

2892.78 --> 2900.2200000000003
four past three

2895.359 --> 2901.72
that's 13 minutes ago no no gas does not

2900.22 --> 2905.98
have weight

2901.72 --> 2908.339
is a convention weight is actually air

2905.98 --> 2908.339
weight

2908.92 --> 2914.14
relative density this equilibrium

2911.079 --> 2917.5
pressure in a medium of air

2914.14 --> 2920.64
the regular atmosphere ground level air

2917.5 --> 2924.94
that's weight you also have water weight

2920.64 --> 2928.24
and vacuum weight huh

2924.94 --> 2930.099
why would they call like it's officially

2928.24 --> 2932.9199999999996
even called that like water weight why

2930.099 --> 2936.42
would they call it water weight

2932.92 --> 2936.42
but there's just weight

2936.94 --> 2942.099
right because it's not weight it's air

2941.14 --> 2945.0989999999997
weight

2942.099 --> 2948.04
water weight in a medium of water air

2945.099 --> 2951.339
weight in a medium of air

2948.04 --> 2952.7799999999997
you can't weigh air

2951.339 --> 2955.7799999999997
in air

2952.78 --> 2957.8190000000004
it doesn't have weight that doesn't work

2955.78 --> 2958.9
it's not gonna cause this equilibrium

2957.819 --> 2961.42
pressure

2958.9 --> 2964.059
it's not gonna weigh anything only when

2961.42 --> 2966.339
you yeah press it until it's really no

2964.059 --> 2969.46
longer air

2966.339 --> 2972.52
right wait you press something enough in

2969.46 --> 2976.0
a tank it's gonna liquefy yeah well it's

2972.52 --> 2979.3
if it's a liquid it's no longer gas

2976.0 --> 2981.46
it's not gonna have the same influence

2979.3 --> 2984.76
then it's gonna gain weight

2981.46 --> 2987.96
that's a whole bunch of air pressurized

2984.76 --> 2987.96
into a liquid state

2990.88 --> 2997.42
that's not regular air regular air

2993.94 --> 3001.079
doesn't have weight it never has weight

2997.42 --> 3003.78
because weight is air weight and in a

3001.079 --> 3007.4
medium of air air is not gonna give you

3003.78 --> 3007.4
this equilibrium Force

3011.94 --> 3016.38
pressurized air dust what are you

3014.579 --> 3019.579
blabbering about

3016.38 --> 3019.579
yes it does

3033.059 --> 3037.3190000000004
right

3034.68 --> 3040.5
and even if it wouldn't doesn't really

3037.319 --> 3042.839
matter because there is so much matter

3040.5 --> 3044.46
in the same spot in yeah with a

3042.839 --> 3046.38
container around it because it doesn't

3044.46 --> 3049.319
happen naturally

3046.38 --> 3051.96
yeah then yeah if you have super

3049.319 --> 3053.819
concentrated amount of gas doesn't

3051.96 --> 3055.619
really matter what type of gas if it's

3053.819 --> 3057.96
super concentrated

3055.619 --> 3060.059
air

3057.96 --> 3061.8
in a medium of air yeah it's gonna have

3060.059 --> 3065.76
a disequilibrium because it's super

3061.8 --> 3068.88
concentrated the density becomes higher

3065.76 --> 3070.2000000000003
yeah it becomes more when it's

3068.88 --> 3072.9
pressurized

3070.2 --> 3074.46
there's literally more it's more dense

3072.9 --> 3077.28
it's compressed

3074.46 --> 3079.92
more dense so yeah it's going to be more

3077.28 --> 3082.92
dense than the medium of air so yeah

3079.92 --> 3086.7200000000003
then it gains weight because it's not

3082.92 --> 3086.7200000000003
the regular air around you

3090.839 --> 3095.42
it's all about relative density this

3092.76 --> 3095.42
equilibrium

3098.28 --> 3102.8
it's the same concept George Sanford

3102.98 --> 3106.28
annoying person

3106.92 --> 3112.38
it's the same it's air weight it's still

3109.92 --> 3114.3
air weight if something's pressurized it

3112.38 --> 3118.619
becomes more dense

3114.3 --> 3121.02
more dense than it gains weight which is

3118.619 --> 3122.88
an extracted convention it's basically

3121.02 --> 3123.839
relative density this equilibrium

3122.88 --> 3126.319
pressure

3123.839 --> 3126.319
yeah

3126.78 --> 3132.1400000000003
so you're gonna still say that air has

3128.94 --> 3132.14
weight do you

3134.04 --> 3139.94
not if it's not super super compressed

3136.92 --> 3139.94
it's just wrong

3144.48 --> 3150.359
see who proves that Eric no it doesn't

3147.96 --> 3151.559
the hell is that

3150.359 --> 3154.4
what

3151.559 --> 3157.6800000000003
no it has pressure

3154.4 --> 3159.9
is not just weight not all pressure is

3157.68 --> 3162.0589999999997
weight

3159.9 --> 3164.28
weight is a convention its relative

3162.059 --> 3167.28
density this equilibrium pressure from

3164.28 --> 3170.5400000000004
Air like in sales that's air pressure

3167.28 --> 3170.5400000000004
that's different

3173.04 --> 3180.0
it's not the same thing oh my god do I

3177.48 --> 3181.8
really have to lay this [ __ ] out

3180.0 --> 3185.579
like

3181.8 --> 3189.8590000000004
I can't handle this this is so annoying

3185.579 --> 3189.8590000000004
you can't be this [ __ ] stupid

3200.04 --> 3204.24
ah

3201.66 --> 3206.0989999999997
it's a nice um

3204.24 --> 3209.52
I'm just gonna focus on something else

3206.099 --> 3211.559
here before you all piss me off

3209.52 --> 3214.339
stupid questions

3211.559 --> 3214.3390000000004
statements

3227.7 --> 3231.2599999999998
yeah pretty beautiful

3231.54 --> 3233.72
foreign

3238.64 --> 3244.52
over surface area yep that's not weight

3241.8 --> 3244.52
it's pressure

3258.119 --> 3264.54
air density yeah but that is what weight

3260.819 --> 3265.859
is 777 that's the whole point weight is

3264.54 --> 3268.92
a convention

3265.859 --> 3272.22
right based on relative density in a

3268.92 --> 3273.359
medium of air weight is actually air

3272.22 --> 3275.819
weight

3273.359 --> 3277.92
that's what weight is

3275.819 --> 3281.64
weight is not its own thing it's not

3277.92 --> 3283.14
caused by gravity according to Newton

3281.64 --> 3285.72
right

3283.14 --> 3289.0789999999997
gravity isn't even a force in order to

3285.72 --> 3291.24
to have that formula

3289.079 --> 3294.2400000000002
doesn't do that

3291.24 --> 3296.0989999999997
it's not a separate thing it's just

3294.24 --> 3299.22
relative density this equilibrium

3296.099 --> 3303.1800000000003
pressure that's what it is in a medium

3299.22 --> 3305.0989999999997
of air weight is air weight

3303.18 --> 3306.5989999999997
right that's why things weigh

3305.099 --> 3310.1400000000003
differently

3306.599 --> 3312.7200000000003
in water because sadly the medium is a

3310.14 --> 3317.0989999999997
lot well denser

3312.72 --> 3318.7799999999997
so yeah if you ever tried weighing air

3317.099 --> 3320.819
in water

3318.78 --> 3322.1400000000003
guess what's gonna happen it's gonna go

3320.819 --> 3325.5589999999997
negative it's going to go the other

3322.14 --> 3328.74
direction you can't weigh air

3325.559 --> 3330.5400000000004
even in a balloon in water it's gonna go

3328.74 --> 3332.4599999999996
up it's not gonna give that downward

3330.54 --> 3335.94
pressure

3332.46 --> 3338.7
because it's way less dense than the

3335.94 --> 3342.78
medium which is water in water weight

3338.7 --> 3346.46
right come on

3342.78 --> 3346.46
this cannot be this hard

3366.26 --> 3371.76
yeah PSI pressure per square inch

3369.9 --> 3376.04
of what

3371.76 --> 3376.0400000000004
we looked it up of what is it

3376.38 --> 3382.5
volume

3379.02 --> 3384.299
then how right it's not just gonna

3382.5 --> 3386.46
it's gonna press against something else

3384.299 --> 3389.04
and then that's something else and then

3386.46 --> 3392.76
against the container wall

3389.04 --> 3395.42
yeah PSI pressure per square inch of the

3392.76 --> 3395.42
container

3400.92 --> 3409.339
or pounds per square inch sorry

3404.579 --> 3409.3390000000004
yeah see I hate those shorts

3426.78 --> 3434.3390000000004
what do you do use pounds for well it's

3430.559 --> 3436.88
the same convention based system as used

3434.339 --> 3436.88
in weight

3437.46 --> 3443.46
so yeah it's anchored in the convention

3440.28 --> 3446.3390000000004
of weight goody does that prove [ __ ]

3443.46 --> 3447.78
gravity [ __ ] no it doesn't it's still

3446.339 --> 3451.16
a convention

3447.78 --> 3456.3590000000004
right pressure yeah pressure comes

3451.16 --> 3459.0589999999997
arrives through different ways [ __ ]

3456.359 --> 3460.5
yeah relative density this equilibrium

3459.059 --> 3463.3190000000004
pressure

3460.5 --> 3467.22
gas pressure different forms of pressure

3463.319 --> 3468.839
they press yeah you can then use the

3467.22 --> 3473.22
convention

3468.839 --> 3475.5589999999997
with a numerical value to say yes

3473.22 --> 3478.3799999999997
this this amount of weight

3475.559 --> 3481.3190000000004
see this amount of pressure calculated

3478.38 --> 3482.7000000000003
in a pound yeah it's still based on the

3481.319 --> 3484.5589999999997
convention

3482.7 --> 3486.4199999999996
right pressure can be caused by

3484.559 --> 3489.299
different things okay so they made

3486.42 --> 3490.98
translated it into pounds to get more

3489.299 --> 3494.819
[ __ ] annoying

3490.98 --> 3497.88
to and reinforce your baltarnation I

3494.819 --> 3501.0
know I know right oh put it into one

3497.88 --> 3503.46
[ __ ] little fictional Gravity Force

3501.0 --> 3507.14
[ __ ] formula I know

3503.46 --> 3507.14
it's all delusion

3507.9 --> 3516.78
right it's just pressure and you can

3511.02 --> 3519.359
name it in pounds which is uh derived

3516.78 --> 3521.1600000000003
from the weight convention it's just

3519.359 --> 3522.24
pressure

3521.16 --> 3525.7799999999997
right

3522.24 --> 3529.4399999999996
and yeah weight has allowed

3525.78 --> 3533.0400000000004
numerical values to be named through

3529.44 --> 3534.26
that system but it's all based still a

3533.04 --> 3538.619
pound

3534.26 --> 3539.7000000000003
is an air weight pound right because a

3538.619 --> 3542.2200000000003
pound

3539.7 --> 3543.839
weight in water is not a pound it

3542.22 --> 3546.54
doesn't give the same amount of pressure

3543.839 --> 3549.54
so it doesn't really matter

3546.54 --> 3551.88
what stupid little formula names you

3549.54 --> 3554.52
find out there that oh pounds that

3551.88 --> 3555.9
proves gravity no it doesn't you [ __ ]

3554.52 --> 3558.48
[ __ ]

3555.9 --> 3561.6600000000003
it doesn't

3558.48 --> 3566.76
it's just a name

3561.66 --> 3569.5789999999997
still based on the numerical values that

3566.76 --> 3573.2400000000002
come rolling out of the relative density

3569.579 --> 3576.7400000000002
this equilibrium pressure in air

3573.24 --> 3576.74
that we know as weight

yeah he is

4067.64 --> 4072.5
and yeah it doesn't really bring out the

4069.74 --> 4074.839
best side of me to be fair but I don't

4072.5 --> 4077.78
care I literally do not care I don't

4074.839 --> 4081.2
care how crazy I come across sometimes

4077.78 --> 4083.6600000000003
or that I'm seething raging

4081.2 --> 4086.5989999999997
and saying they have to die they have to

4083.66 --> 4090.2
die because I mean it

4086.599 --> 4092.1400000000003
it's not just squirting it's me unable

4090.2 --> 4095.96
to basically

4092.14 --> 4098.839
withdraw from the moment

4095.96 --> 4103.339
I mean it like there are people in this

4098.839 --> 4106.339
world that should be freaking smashed

4103.339 --> 4108.46
it's just that the [ __ ] setup of

4106.339 --> 4112.159
everything this

4108.46 --> 4115.94
civilization you know this is the result

4112.159 --> 4119.48
of your [ __ ] civilization yeah these

4115.94 --> 4122.599999999999
scumbag Anonymous pieces of [ __ ] that

4119.48 --> 4125.419999999999
stalk everybody knowingly lying and this

4122.6 --> 4128.06
is not some [ __ ] opinion this is not

4125.42 --> 4130.819
even a social construct or anything

4128.06 --> 4133.52
right like who's your racist or what no

4130.819 --> 4136.279
this is a person that just knowingly

4133.52 --> 4141.040000000001
lies mechanically and then stalks people

4136.279 --> 4141.040000000001
with it these people should be murdered

4141.14 --> 4146.54
it's not gonna happen

4143.299 --> 4147.62
because these [ __ ] scumbags are

4146.54 --> 4151.839
around

4147.62 --> 4151.839
and nobody knows what to do with it

4151.94 --> 4157.04
there's actually people out there that

4154.04 --> 4158.96
are even much more vulnerable

4157.04 --> 4162.259
than myself

4158.96 --> 4165.14
that like some of these people out there

4162.259 --> 4167.42
literally make them commit suicide

4165.14 --> 4171.319
like

4167.42 --> 4174.319
it makes me think maybe anonymity on the

4171.319 --> 4177.7390000000005
internet should be completely illegal

4174.319 --> 4179.6
so that can all be marked

4177.739 --> 4181.2789999999995
by their behavior because they're still

4179.6 --> 4184.04
going to do what they do anyway they

4181.279 --> 4186.56
can't stop it should all be marked

4184.04 --> 4188.359
and then at some point police is Gonna

4186.56 --> 4190.819
Get You

4188.359 --> 4194.299
and if they don't because the laws don't

4190.819 --> 4196.280000000001
abide then people can find out who you

4194.299 --> 4197.719
are

4196.28 --> 4199.58
yeah

4197.719 --> 4202.84
then they can do something about it

4199.58 --> 4206.86
because this behavior is absolutely

4202.84 --> 4206.860000000001
intolerable in every sense

4206.98 --> 4212.9
everybody hates you

4210.199 --> 4216.759999999999
and you're only making it worse

4212.9 --> 4216.759999999999
and you're in love with that

4223.4 --> 4227.239
hello psych bear

4225.5 --> 4229.58
yeah

4227.239 --> 4232.94
you're in love with death so we should

4229.58 --> 4236.199
give you what you really want

4232.94 --> 4236.199
that's my opinion

4252.32 --> 4254.86
hmm

4260.54 --> 4266.96
all right 777

4263.659 --> 4270.94
well well that is idiotic that that's

4266.96 --> 4270.94
the case right that people could do that

4271.1 --> 4276.320000000001
but I'm talking very specifically about

4273.86 --> 4278.659
this

4276.32 --> 4281.12
this Behavior

4278.659 --> 4283.599999999999
is basically cyber bullying it even has

4281.12 --> 4283.599999999999
a name

4285.199 --> 4294.0199999999995
it should be punished severely

4289.54 --> 4297.82
severely actual punishment by law it

4294.02 --> 4297.820000000001
should be punished severely

4300.679 --> 4307.219
and I am actually kind of fully willing

4303.8 --> 4309.4400000000005
to give up all anonymity

4307.219 --> 4312.02
on the internet

4309.44 --> 4314.178999999999
just just to get at him at this point

4312.02 --> 4316.400000000001
like

4314.179 --> 4319.82
you want it you're gonna get it no more

4316.4 --> 4323.0
freedom for you yeah because you abuse

4319.82 --> 4327.98
the anonymity on the internet to act

4323.0 --> 4329.719
like straight out demon scumbags

4327.98 --> 4332.839999999999
now guess what's going to happen if the

4329.719 --> 4335.12
internet's no longer Anonymous ah oh you

4332.84 --> 4337.54
can't squirt anymore oh yeah maybe it's

4335.12 --> 4340.96
time to [ __ ] finish yourself off then

4337.54 --> 4340.96
piece of [ __ ]

4341.48 --> 4347.739
you got that in you maybe you should do

4344.0 --> 4347.739
something about it huh

4350.36 --> 4356.54
but yes there's a big problem

4353.659 --> 4358.639999999999
when internet anonymity goes out of the

4356.54 --> 4361.28
door completely and that is that there

4358.64 --> 4365.659000000001
is political persecution

4361.28 --> 4368.599999999999
on relatively tame opinions

4365.659 --> 4370.699
that's a big problem right that you

4368.6 --> 4373.58
can't like I guess

4370.699 --> 4374.54
be associated with flat Earth as a

4373.58 --> 4377.0599999999995
physician

4374.54 --> 4380.9
that's problematic because that would

4377.06 --> 4384.02
then burden all those people

4380.9 --> 4385.879999999999
and that's how these scumbags basically

4384.02 --> 4389.780000000001
keep doing what they do

4385.88 --> 4393.32
like why aren't agencies tracing them

4389.78 --> 4398.599999999999
why aren't they being marked they can be

4393.32 --> 4402.679
agencies cyber agencies can do that they

4398.6 --> 4405.679
can do it why don't they do that

4402.679 --> 4409.04
you're already got all that [ __ ] out

4405.679 --> 4411.9800000000005
there why don't you go after these

4409.04 --> 4415.28
people that systematically anonymously

4411.98 --> 4419.0
troll other people to the point of

4415.28 --> 4422.179
suicide why aren't you getting them

4419.0 --> 4424.52
get them you can you have the [ __ ]

4422.179 --> 4427.659
technology get them

4424.52 --> 4427.659000000001
do something

4439.04 --> 4441.219
foreign

4477.38 --> 4483.8
this clutch poops in his sock that's

4481.28 --> 4486.5
hilarious

4483.8 --> 4490.900000000001
or if he doesn't then

4486.5 --> 4490.9
Santa's gonna poop in his sock for sure

4493.1 --> 4496.64
I mean you're not even getting a piece

4495.08 --> 4498.92
of coal you're just getting a turd

4496.64 --> 4501.88
you're getting Santa's turd in your sock

4498.92 --> 4501.88
this year boy

4504.14 --> 4510.88
oh oh clutch by the way man oh that

4507.88 --> 4513.34
mountain bears video

4510.88 --> 4515.84
the Irish guy

4513.34 --> 4516.92
oh let's let's think about something

4515.84 --> 4520.54
cool

4516.92 --> 4520.54
oh that was so funny

4521.179 --> 4523.78
ugh

4529.159 --> 4536.12
yeah right

4531.5 --> 4538.82
I mean seriously like a piece of coal

4536.12 --> 4541.34
that's actually useful you could use it

4538.82 --> 4545.659
uh for in your Hearth and all that right

4541.34 --> 4547.58
it's not fun it's like yeah you're bad

4545.659 --> 4551.179
but like a turd

4547.58 --> 4554.12
I think is much more appropriate for

4551.179 --> 4558.04
this type of person to get in their sock

4554.12 --> 4558.04
above the Hearth during Christmas

4572.48 --> 4577.54
cold is too good for them yeah

4575.3 --> 4577.54
foreign

4577.84 --> 4583.96
Burgers all right

4580.1 --> 4583.96
yeah mountain bear crushes indeed

4595.45 --> 4598.5199999999995
[Music]

4599.78 --> 4602.92
hello Gideon is sick

4626.92 --> 4632.1990000000005
oh man I'm getting hungry

4635.54 --> 4637.6
um

4643.46 --> 4647.0
yeah normally this would be the time

4645.199 --> 4648.44
where I basically start putting a pizza

4647.0 --> 4651.88
in the oven

4648.44 --> 4651.879999999999
I might actually do that

4651.92 --> 4658.4800000000005
maybe I'll just eat the pizza right down

4654.02 --> 4658.4800000000005
yeah during the live stream why not

4658.52 --> 4664.540000000001
maybe I could even it's weird though

4661.12 --> 4668.0599999999995
like have a beer

4664.54 --> 4670.699
I normally don't do that on my show

4668.06 --> 4673.42
but maybe I need it after this freaking

4670.699 --> 4673.419999999999
psycho

4674.719 --> 4678.5
I'm the stalker

4676.34 --> 4680.7390000000005
it will definitely just kind of distract

4678.5 --> 4680.739
me

4682.699 --> 4687.4
man I haven't had a beer in like three

4684.86 --> 4687.4

4704.6 --> 4709.6
to the government anymore I'm just

4706.82 --> 4712.5199999999995

4709.6 --> 4716.120000000001

a [ __ ] of what you think is supposed to

4725.9 --> 4730.46
be done just gonna do what we do and I

4729.26 --> 4733.58
don't care

4730.46 --> 4735.9800000000005
I don't care anymore

4733.58 --> 4738.5
what you're telling us to do we don't

4735.98 --> 4741.08
care anymore I don't care anymore you

4738.5 --> 4745.52
should neither like totally ignoring it

4741.08 --> 4749.48
like you don't exist you're just now CNN

4745.52 --> 4752.4800000000005
right governments are now just CNN you

4749.48 --> 4754.099999999999
should completely ignore it just don't

4752.48 --> 4756.139999999999
listen anymore

4754.1 --> 4761.96
ignore it

4756.14 --> 4764.14
it's all a bunch of blabbering [ __ ]

4761.96 --> 4764.14
foreign

4771.699 --> 4775.96
just this gay stalker I think

4779.239 --> 4784.759999999999
but yeah it was originally like this

4781.82 --> 4785.78
freaking worship Jesus who isn't even a

4784.76 --> 4787.9400000000005
Christian

4785.78 --> 4791.179
and I didn't know the last few days I

4787.94 --> 4793.4
guess he's been able to sort of behave

4791.179 --> 4795.5
but he was getting on my nerves and like

4793.4 --> 4798.04
like how the [ __ ] dare you even take

4795.5 --> 4798.04
that name

4798.199 --> 4805.36
to mock him basically so I'm surprised I

4801.86 --> 4805.36
hadn't banned him before

4805.699 --> 4811.58
I was kind of an [ __ ] at times but

4807.8 --> 4813.679
yeah but today it just like went way way

4811.58 --> 4816.5
out of control and then this other gay

4813.679 --> 4819.32
troll joined into I don't know who it is

4816.5 --> 4822.76
man it's disgusting

4819.32 --> 4822.759999999999
it's genuine dude

4824.719 --> 4828.9800000000005
I think

4826.219 --> 4831.679
I think it might be

4828.98 --> 4834.138999999999
what's his name again Jason I think it

4831.679 --> 4836.42
might be awake Souls dude I heard

4834.139 --> 4840.159000000001
something from Rasta yesterday that

4836.42 --> 4840.159
literally almost made me throw up

4840.86 --> 4845.0599999999995
I

4842.12 --> 4848.0599999999995
have managed to elude that piece of data

4845.06 --> 4851.900000000001
for a long time and I'm kind of sad that

4848.06 --> 4856.120000000001
I found out because it's so disgusting

4851.9 --> 4856.12
just I don't even want to say it

4856.82 --> 4862.82
but yeah apparently

4859.219 --> 4865.88
he is just openly gay

4862.82 --> 4868.54
and the guy he does his shows with is

4865.88 --> 4868.54
his boyfriend

4869.08 --> 4875.739
okay the pizza can wait for a while

4873.139 --> 4875.7390000000005
oh

4878.0 --> 4880.3
oh

4880.58 --> 4885.5199999999995
my God it's so disgusting it might be

4884.48 --> 4888.86
him

4885.52 --> 4891.34
because he's always [ __ ] whining

4888.86 --> 4894.92
about me being gay that's what gays do

4891.34 --> 4897.139
he is gay he's openly gay and he calls

5610.5 --> 5616.719
that isn't basically just beer

5614.62 --> 5620.46
I don't really respond well to alcohol

5616.719 --> 5620.46
in general I've figured out

5622.6 --> 5627.46
and neither did my mother by the way

5624.82 --> 5630.099999999999
like she couldn't hold her liquor either

5627.46 --> 5632.9800000000005

5630.1 --> 5636.6
serious where she had to be hospitalized

5632.98 --> 5636.599999999999

5748.179 --> 5756.159
yeah let me show you what pizza I got

5753.1 --> 5759.280000000001
it's surprisingly good

5756.159 --> 5762.879999999999
I made in Germany but yeah it's vegan

5759.28 --> 5765.84
this is a vegan pizza

5762.88 --> 5765.84
weird isn't it

5773.58 --> 5777.5199999999995
right but anyway

5776.44 --> 5780.94
stupid

5777.52 --> 5783.46
or is it yeah it's vegan so there's not

5780.94 --> 5785.259999999999
even cheese on this but they managed to

5783.46 --> 5787.78
somehow replace that

5785.26 --> 5790.84
and it's actually really good

5787.78 --> 5793.9
I kind of like it

5790.84 --> 5796.360000000001
also because yeah well I do seem to have

5793.9 --> 5799.48
like slight lactose intolerance it's not

5796.36 --> 5802.5
really bad that bad but yeah I don't get

5799.48 --> 5802.5
that issue with these

5802.659 --> 5806.5
so what's what do you want to replace it

5805.0 --> 5808.719
with

5806.5 --> 5811.659
ah

5808.719 --> 5815.38
let's see

5811.659 --> 5817.42
Pizza yeah coconut fat potato starch

5815.38 --> 5820.54
Lupine flour

5817.42 --> 5823.719
and corkuma that's like the replacement

5820.54 --> 5827.199
cheese and it works really well

5823.719 --> 5829.0
it's nice like it almost tastes like

5827.199 --> 5831.28
cheese

5829.0 --> 5832.3
it doesn't have like any weird off taste

5831.28 --> 5835.179
or anything

5832.3 --> 5836.9800000000005
so yeah that's the one I'm gonna get

5835.179 --> 5839.139
oh thank you getting sick for the five

5836.98 --> 5843.659
pound Super Chat donation at least have

5839.139 --> 5843.659000000001
a beer on me okay I am

5845.02 --> 5849.96
I think until I could get like one beer

5847.54 --> 5849.96
out of that

5875.98 --> 5881.619
we are poor

5877.96 --> 5884.5
I don't know you still have a family

5881.619 --> 5886.54
I mean you might not be like super

5884.5 --> 5889.48
middle class or anything

5886.54 --> 5891.46
but yeah you have a family you're not

5889.48 --> 5893.799999999999
really poor are you

5891.46 --> 5895.78
like I have weird days where sometimes I

5893.8 --> 5899.159000000001
just don't have any food I don't think

5895.78 --> 5899.159
you're in that position right

5900.76 --> 5905.08
like this weekend I really have to

5902.38 --> 5906.9400000000005
scramble for it but it's fine I managed

5905.08 --> 5910.619
to pull through

5906.94 --> 5913.419999999999
didn't drink anything but yeah I'm fine

5910.619 --> 5915.58
like not smoking anything was a lot

5913.42 --> 5920.52
tougher

5915.58 --> 5920.5199999999995
maybe that's part of like mood issues

5921.94 --> 5928.419999999999
yeah family is wealth exactly it is it

5924.699 --> 5931.9
really is it makes things work out

5928.42 --> 5934.84
and they're the best consolidation

5931.9 --> 5936.96
like the the best uh console what do you

5934.84 --> 5936.96
say

5937.06 --> 5942.9400000000005
are you just like feeling not good like

5940.119 --> 5944.44
kids really

5942.94 --> 5946.839999999999
like especially when they're really

5944.44 --> 5949.299999999999
young they they like really help you out

5946.84 --> 5951.52
I did with my parents when I was young

5949.3 --> 5953.679
and I just noticed that

5951.52 --> 5957.46
that just happens

5953.679 --> 5959.8
so yeah when you're alone and miserable

5957.46 --> 5961.659
it's a lot worse

5959.8 --> 5964.659000000001
and everybody gets a little miserable

5961.659 --> 5967.92
every now and then that's kind of normal

5964.659 --> 5967.92
go through phases

5970.239 --> 5973.839999999999
they don't have a 401k you have children

5972.159 --> 5976.138999999999
that will take care of you that's

5973.84 --> 5976.139
awesome

5980.26 --> 5986.6990000000005
right

5981.58 --> 5986.699
yeah well Jose in a way you know

5987.46 --> 5990.4800000000005
I'm okay too

5997.0 --> 6001.139
but yeah I do feel kind of lonely

5999.4 --> 6003.799999999999
sometimes that's the that's the main

6001.139 --> 6003.8
difference right

6009.78 --> 6012.92
it is what it is

6013.44 --> 6015.678999999999
foreign

6016.82 --> 6022.58
with it because I'm like kind of an out

6019.679 --> 6025.679
of control guy in waste anyway you know

6022.58 --> 6029.04
intellectual with like massive passions

6025.679 --> 6030.78
that go seething rate sometimes that's

6029.04 --> 6032.88
kind of like

6030.78 --> 6035.34
I don't really feel like I'm like this

6032.88 --> 6038.52
ultimate candidate for procreation like

6035.34 --> 6040.7390000000005
that to women like I feel that I am I

6038.52 --> 6043.320000000001
feel I'm the ultimate candidate it's

6040.739 --> 6045.959999999999
just that out there

6043.32 --> 6049.199
I mean I think that girls probably think

6045.96 --> 6051.179
I'm sexy but do they really think that

6049.199 --> 6054.0
like oh let's get kits with that I don't

6051.179 --> 6057.0
know man maybe I'm just

6054.0 --> 6060.239
just being negative about it

6057.0 --> 6063.619
my time hopefully will come someday

6060.239 --> 6063.619
if I'm ready for it

6063.84 --> 6068.900000000001
if God allows it if it's if I'm supposed

6066.239 --> 6068.9
to do that

6071.04 --> 6077.46
yeah yeah but hey gay troll don't worry

6074.46 --> 6079.5
about it I'm absolutely heterosexual

6077.46 --> 6082.38
yeah

6079.5 --> 6085.92
I would show you

6082.38 --> 6089.159000000001
photographs of me and my ex

6085.92 --> 6091.5
if I didn't just actually respect her

6089.159 --> 6095.699
despite everything that's happened

6091.5 --> 6099.239
she's freaking gorgeous like that my ex

6095.699 --> 6102.48
is a girl that would make many men just

6099.239 --> 6105.0
squirt in their pants just seeing her or

6102.48 --> 6107.28
at least I'd like to think that

6105.0 --> 6110.159
all right

6107.28 --> 6112.32
so yeah not gay that's projection that's

6110.159 --> 6114.719
just you being desperate

6112.32 --> 6119.58
like oh

6114.719 --> 6122.1
I can't stop thinking about gays so

6119.58 --> 6124.0199999999995
everybody has to be gay

6122.1 --> 6127.02
that's what you're doing

6124.02 --> 6131.040000000001
I'm definitely not gay I very much dig

6127.02 --> 6134.34
women the problem is is that sometimes

6131.04 --> 6137.28
yeah my heart like when my heart breaks

6134.34 --> 6138.84
it really sucks and that's kind of the

6137.28 --> 6141.44
thing that's

6138.84 --> 6141.4400000000005
the problem

6142.679 --> 6147.78
like to me it's not just like oh let's

6145.56 --> 6150.659000000001
oh let's do this let's do that oh let's

6147.78 --> 6153.44
check oh I like you let's go

6150.659 --> 6153.44
because

6153.659 --> 6158.4
unless I kind of fall in love it doesn't

6156.0 --> 6160.199
really do anything for me but when I

6158.4 --> 6162.599999999999
fall in love

6160.199 --> 6166.08
and it does do something for me

6162.6 --> 6168.84
well I end up like getting through well

6166.08 --> 6170.28
what I experience is quite torturous

6168.84 --> 6173.88
pains

6170.28 --> 6176.219
like it love really hurts me

6173.88 --> 6178.8
when it's over

6176.219 --> 6181.44
if I actually got to that point

6178.8 --> 6184.08
and now I just kind of like I'm just not

6181.44 --> 6186.78
too eager to have like hallucinations

6184.08 --> 6187.86
from heartache again if you know what I

6186.78 --> 6191.599999999999
mean

6187.86 --> 6191.599999999999
yeah let me get my pizza

6231.0 --> 6233.78
foreign

6237.139 --> 6245.179

6240.54 --> 6245.179
Pizza doesn't look bad right

6249.06 --> 6252.7390000000005

6259.92 --> 6262.1
foreign

6281.48 --> 6287.459999999999

6285.659 --> 6290.96

thank you I really appreciate that

6312.42 --> 6316.1990000000005
huh

6313.5 --> 6318.6
I didn't expect that from you

6316.199 --> 6321.9
all right yeah I hope you can I hope you

6318.6 --> 6324.6
have the the maneuvering room for that

6321.9 --> 6327.199
but yeah thank you very much

6324.6 --> 6327.1990000000005
huh

6328.139 --> 6332.4800000000005
yeah

6329.94 --> 6332.48
it's nice

6346.76 --> 6350.4800000000005
getting all messy

6354.36 --> 6358.5
I only troll responsibly

6360.119 --> 6362.119
um

6370.139 --> 6376.34
yeah but Jose you don't really troll

6372.719 --> 6376.34
you're you're just kind of

6376.92 --> 6380.58
you act like a bit of a smart ass

6378.719 --> 6384.2390000000005
sometimes or whatever

6380.58 --> 6387.3
but at least you don't like stalk people

6384.239 --> 6390.599999999999
you're not like super nasty

6387.3 --> 6395.6
I mean you have issues sometimes but

6390.6 --> 6395.6
you're not like a nasty stalker type so

6397.8 --> 6401.84
that's great never go there

6418.38 --> 6421.38
hmm

6430.08 --> 6432.199
okay

6433.619 --> 6436.159
right

6447.179 --> 6453.26
yeah that's right drunken bullet I use

6449.639 --> 6453.26
scissors for my pizza that's right

6480.96 --> 6486.679
well it it has a different success rate

6484.8 --> 6490.08
with different types of pizzas I mean

6486.679 --> 6491.9400000000005
pizzas with like really thin bottoms

6490.08 --> 6494.28
and works great

6491.94 --> 6497.219
and if you have like super thick

6494.28 --> 6500.36
pizzas then it doesn't work at all it's

6497.219 --> 6500.36
actually kind of annoying

6503.82 --> 6508.759999999999
better to just

6505.56 --> 6508.76
like cut it

6512.159 --> 6515.239
yeah Jose

6519.719 --> 6524.6
I don't trim my mustache with that

6521.82 --> 6524.599999999999
scissors thanks

6524.94 --> 6530.119
that's a food scissor I keep it in my

6527.94 --> 6530.119
kitchen

6538.44 --> 6540.678999999999
foreign

6571.739 --> 6573.98
foreign

6591.98 --> 6596.78
yeah see you later Jose thanks for the

6594.48 --> 6596.78
PayPal

6602.46 --> 6607.86
if I don't see you soon then happy

6606.06 --> 6611.900000000001
Christmas

6607.86 --> 6611.9
or happy holidays whatever you like

6653.94 --> 6656.48
okay

6657.36 --> 6660.36
foreign

6678.78 --> 6685.82
I don't

6681.119 --> 6685.82
exactly have a photographic memory but

6687.54 --> 6692.82
in ways I do it's just I wouldn't call

6690.42 --> 6695.76
it photographic

6692.82 --> 6697.5
but I do have like distinct very deep

6695.76 --> 6699.42
memories that I'm that are very

6697.5 --> 6702.06
accessible

6699.42 --> 6704.099
but it's not Universal it's not the

6702.06 --> 6706.56
whole thing

6704.099 --> 6709.38
it's a bit scattered but the part the

6706.56 --> 6712.6990000000005
fragments that I do remember

6709.38 --> 6712.6990000000005
are very consistent

6718.98 --> 6723.0199999999995
and I've like learned to work with it

6726.659 --> 6730.679
okay

6728.0 --> 6735.06
you could see say that I pretty much

6730.679 --> 6737.36
rearranged my entire way of being around

6735.06 --> 6737.360000000001
it

6738.719 --> 6744.119
but yes like especially when I dream

6741.179 --> 6747.119
lock and all that

6744.119 --> 6749.04
it's like I get so caught up in things

6747.119 --> 6750.179
that it's very tough for me to kind of

6749.04 --> 6753.719
like

6750.179 --> 6757.28
Zone back into where I am

6753.719 --> 6757.28
what I'm supposed to be doing

6761.4 --> 6764.299999999999
then again

6765.48 --> 6769.44
I kind of

6767.4 --> 6771.0
gotten into a position where there's

6769.44 --> 6774.98
really not

6771.0 --> 6774.98
even that much of that to do

6779.76 --> 6784.4400000000005
kind of designated myself as an oracle

6782.099 --> 6786.599
so yeah dream walking and looking into

6784.44 --> 6788.28
the future and doing all that is what I

6786.599 --> 6790.56
do

6788.28 --> 6792.719
right I don't have like a lot of Earthly

6790.56 --> 6795.4800000000005
responsibilities

6792.719 --> 6798.679
directly surrounding me I mean if I'd

6795.48 --> 6798.678999999999
have a family I would

6799.619 --> 6804.42
and it would be more testing to uphold

6802.44 --> 6807.32
what I do

6804.42 --> 6812.179
but yeah right now I'm pretty much

6807.32 --> 6812.179
in an ideal spot to do what I do

6812.58 --> 6820.58
except maybe for the finances but yeah

6816.96 --> 6820.58
can be perfect in every way

6823.679 --> 6825.679
um

6841.08 --> 6844.28
my issue is

6844.86 --> 6851.0
like it's existential issue it has to do

6848.46 --> 6851.0
with

6851.639 --> 6857.639
my character in moments

6854.76 --> 6860.46
like in the past where I would be

6857.639 --> 6862.86
confronted with information directly

6860.46 --> 6866.04
about the future like basically somebody

6862.86 --> 6869.82
telling me we're gonna do this

6866.04 --> 6873.38
like with our big group or Satan or

6869.82 --> 6873.38
however that would be named

6873.42 --> 6881.9
and my absolute utter delusional

6877.08 --> 6881.9
inability to accept that that's real

6882.119 --> 6887.4
and I'm still like really pissed off at

6885.36 --> 6891.54
myself for all these moments throughout

6887.4 --> 6894.42
my life where I was just like ah

6891.54 --> 6897.199
I'm just gonna pretend like I didn't

6894.42 --> 6897.1990000000005
hear that

6898.02 --> 6901.639
like why didn't I adapt

6901.739 --> 6906.36
why didn't I actually assume that it was

6904.139 --> 6908.76
right there right in front of me and I

6906.36 --> 6911.219
refused and I was proud for refusing it

6908.76 --> 6914.58
and I cannot

6911.219 --> 6916.56
believe it no I can't believe that I did

6914.58 --> 6920.659
all that

6916.56 --> 6920.659000000001
it ruined so much for me

6932.04 --> 6935.0
oh [ __ ]

6951.719 --> 6954.619
oh damn

6958.38 --> 6961.639
oh that's not good

6961.8 --> 6965.34
yeah my friend from name it just sent me

6964.32 --> 6968.759999999999
a message

6965.34 --> 6971.76
a really good friend of hers

6968.76 --> 6973.38
is having very serious lung issues and

6971.76 --> 6977.400000000001
that's like what do we do what do we do

6973.38 --> 6980.4800000000005
so I just sent her that I and I spell it

6977.4 --> 6980.48
out you know what I'm talking about

7024.5 --> 7029.42
did Flat Earth come in between me and my

7027.139 --> 7032.0
last girl well yeah effectively yeah

7029.42 --> 7033.679
it's like she was waiting for me to go

7032.0 --> 7035.599
there

7033.679 --> 7038.84
just so she could

7035.599 --> 7040.88
absolutely break me over it

7038.84 --> 7045.32
sometimes I think that my my

7040.88 --> 7046.46
ex-girlfriend was actually a setup

7045.32 --> 7050.36
I mean

7046.46 --> 7052.82
she kind of knew the Jesuit guy

7050.36 --> 7057.04
by her own admissions crazy the whole

7052.82 --> 7057.04
thing is crazy my life is crazy

7060.86 --> 7068.0199999999995
I sometimes think that she was like

7064.4 --> 7068.0199999999995
ordered to break me

7071.54 --> 7076.94
but yeah then again it could just be

7074.06 --> 7079.46
stupid love you know

7076.94 --> 7081.379999999999
can't really figure that out anymore and

7079.46 --> 7083.679
that's the whole [ __ ] part about it all

7081.38 --> 7083.679
of it

7083.84 --> 7089.900000000001
but I've had like really weird Dark

7086.239 --> 7093.4
World situations even happening then

7089.9 --> 7093.4
when I was living there with her

7099.38 --> 7103.84
but yeah it's pretty much the moment

7101.42 --> 7103.84
that

7106.04 --> 7111.5
that I like started to be like yeah but

7109.159 --> 7114.5
Flat Earth right it's real

7111.5 --> 7117.46
that's kind of like I think like the Cur

7114.5 --> 7117.46
the turning point

7126.08 --> 7131.54
and by the way as soon as I realized

7128.719 --> 7133.82
that I quickly forgot all of it I

7131.54 --> 7135.86
literally erased it from my mind as soon

7133.82 --> 7139.42
as I found out that she was gonna

7135.86 --> 7139.42
break up with me over that

7139.58 --> 7144.76
without her actually saying that but

7141.739 --> 7144.759999999999
just feeling it

7148.82 --> 7156.739
I successfully completely erased it from

7152.48 --> 7160.178999999999
my mind completely literally like no

7156.739 --> 7160.178999999999
recollection of it

7161.3 --> 7165.28
that's how much I was in love with her

7197.9 --> 7200.9
foreign

7230.719 --> 7232.9
foreign

7238.34 --> 7243.56
are you guys still there I mean it's now

7241.4 --> 7245.0599999999995
mostly me

7243.56 --> 7247.9400000000005
eating

7245.06 --> 7249.679
and answering text messages from my

7247.94 --> 7252.219
friend and Amy huh

7249.679 --> 7252.219
but

7256.699 --> 7260.659
I mean otherwise I will just kind of

7258.56 --> 7263.92
round out the show I mean I have been

7260.659 --> 7263.92
going for two hours now

7264.139 --> 7271.42
did the chat freeze

7267.32 --> 7271.42
no just people stop talking

7280.34 --> 7285.52
but it is very late for an early bird

7282.739 --> 7285.5199999999995
show so

7308.02 --> 7313.820000000001
well I really hope that works out

7311.239 --> 7317.0599999999995
because that's like a really dare and

7313.82 --> 7320.739
their trend of her

7317.06 --> 7320.7390000000005
and it sounds pretty serious

7337.82 --> 7342.98
our eyes are open now she's through

7340.639 --> 7346.719
yeah okay that's really awesome psych

7342.98 --> 7346.718999999999
bear I'm very very happy for you

7350.06 --> 7356.7390000000005
but

7352.219 --> 7356.7390000000005
yeah my ex is not it wasn't gonna happen

7356.9 --> 7362.719
I mean she was too much part of the

7359.0 --> 7365.179
Beast system like she wanted to be part

7362.719 --> 7367.42
of the B system she wanted all that

7365.179 --> 7367.42
stuff

7369.199 --> 7373.94
I mean

7370.76 --> 7375.679
it's like well nobody really knows who

7373.94 --> 7378.259999999999
she is anyway but

7375.679 --> 7380.96
I sometimes think that that she was

7378.26 --> 7384.26
actually a Satanist

7380.96 --> 7387.08
she had absolutely no respect for

7384.26 --> 7389.56
Christianity whatsoever but she kind of

7387.08 --> 7389.5599999999995
didn't care

7393.32 --> 7398.54
so it's more like an atheist but like

7395.9 --> 7401.179
really she just wanted to be part of the

7398.54 --> 7404.719
system and she never wanted kids and all

7401.179 --> 7406.159
that like really insistent right that

7404.719 --> 7408.7390000000005
might have been the part that broke it

7406.159 --> 7411.679
for me because I really wanted kids with

7408.739 --> 7414.919999999999
her like she is so gorgeous so tell I

7411.679 --> 7417.38
was like you must do that

7414.92 --> 7420.02
I want that

7417.38 --> 7421.6990000000005
it's actually kind of the thing that I

7420.02 --> 7423.92
found attractive about her in the first

7421.699 --> 7426.739
place is just that she's so incredibly

7423.92 --> 7429.639
talented and sensitive

7426.739 --> 7429.638999999999
and beautiful

7437.42 --> 7444.82
to me it's just maximum tragedy right I

7440.599 --> 7444.82
haven't had a relation since that's now

7445.4 --> 7449.9
eight years ago

7447.079 --> 7452.079
right I've never been

7449.9 --> 7457.659
without a girlfriend for this long ever

7452.079 --> 7457.659
because it broke me it really did

7457.82 --> 7460.96
it still hurts

7461.119 --> 7466.119
sounds really lame but it still does

7466.639 --> 7473.54
I mean I dreamed about her last night

7470.36 --> 7475.699
and waking up from that dream it really

7473.54 --> 7478.46
hurt

7475.699 --> 7480.739
because I'm still in love with her I

7478.46 --> 7482.719
don't think I can ever stop

7480.739 --> 7485.678999999999
even though I know that she's not even

7482.719 --> 7485.679
the same person anymore

7486.86 --> 7491.139
what age am I now I'm 41.

7496.94 --> 7499.759999999999
staying with her would have destroyed me

7498.679 --> 7503.119
yes

7499.76 --> 7506.56
but sometimes a consider maybe I wanted

7503.119 --> 7506.5599999999995
to be destroyed by her

7511.579 --> 7516.38
I mean she could have never never break

7513.739 --> 7519.739
in my moral code

7516.38 --> 7521.599
but she could have absolutely like just

7519.739 --> 7523.94
wrecked me

7521.599 --> 7526.82
and maybe I wanted that

7523.94 --> 7529.0
maybe that's just my way to get out of

7526.82 --> 7529.0
here

7530.36 --> 7533.5599999999995
because yeah

7535.94 --> 7538.659
I don't know

7540.619 --> 7545.719
I thought I was like 30. yeah thanks DX

7543.739 --> 7548.78
I know

7545.719 --> 7551.06
I have a youthful resemblance

7548.78 --> 7553.48
and it's got yeah always going to be

7551.06 --> 7553.4800000000005
like that

7556.159 --> 7561.5
I have a very youthful Spirit as well

7559.76 --> 7564.38
but

7561.5 --> 7566.42
also the issues of youthfulness don't

7564.38 --> 7568.900000000001
seem to be going away

7566.42 --> 7568.9
right

7576.02 --> 7580.400000000001
you'll meet someone better

7578.179 --> 7582.8
well that's what people been telling me

7580.4 --> 7585.86
for eight years psych bear

7582.8 --> 7588.679
but that's so cool it's all good okay

7585.86 --> 7592.219
maybe I was meant to be single

7588.679 --> 7594.8
like maybe I am actually a

7592.219 --> 7597.82
a cathar high priest or something and I

7594.8 --> 7597.820000000001
don't even realize it

7600.139 --> 7604.219
which aren't supposed to have kids

7601.82 --> 7606.199
apparently I don't know I don't know

7604.219 --> 7610.4
anymore I've been through such weird

7606.199 --> 7612.32
[ __ ] with my Visions I might be

7610.4 --> 7615.0199999999995
I don't know

7612.32 --> 7617.78
I don't know anymore because most of

7615.02 --> 7621.8
what happened in that 80-year vision

7617.78 --> 7624.739
is kind of gone like the the cohesion is

7621.8 --> 7628.6990000000005
gone I just have like

7624.739 --> 7631.098999999999
picture book without the text of it all

7628.699 --> 7634.638999999999
that's what I have left I don't know

7631.099 --> 7636.9800000000005
anymore the conversations that we've had

7634.639 --> 7639.079
sometimes if it's brought up then it

7636.98 --> 7641.48
triggers like an anchoring point where

7639.079 --> 7645.099
suddenly it does clear up a bit but

7641.48 --> 7648.379999999999
overall I don't I I've had so many

7645.099 --> 7651.56
intricate information go through me like

7648.38 --> 7654.079
I was almost experienced like I was all

7651.56 --> 7656.0
knowing but including the torture of

7654.079 --> 7658.639
knowing

7656.0 --> 7662.659
and I couldn't stop it started out

7658.639 --> 7665.719
really feeling super super powerful

7662.659 --> 7667.579
and then ended up like help I want out I

7665.719 --> 7670.9
want out I want out I don't care what

7667.579 --> 7670.9
you're gonna do to me I went out

7675.38 --> 7681.4400000000005
but yeah I didn't know will I find

7678.32 --> 7683.36
somebody maybe I will I have memories

7681.44 --> 7684.739
but I don't know if it's a fantasy or

7683.36 --> 7686.9
not

7684.739 --> 7688.82
I really don't

7686.9 --> 7691.4
I mean I have memories from the dark

7688.82 --> 7694.699
world but I don't know if that's real

7691.4 --> 7698.0
because everything in the Dark World

7694.699 --> 7700.219
it's all based on what I imagine

7698.0 --> 7703.099
in the future

7700.219 --> 7705.679
so I don't know if it's real or if it's

7703.099 --> 7706.6990000000005
just more born out of desperation and it

7705.679 --> 7708.8
isn't real

7706.699 --> 7711.159
I don't know

7708.8 --> 7714.9800000000005
I don't know with any of it

7711.159 --> 7717.199
including like War scenarios all that

7714.98 --> 7720.0199999999995
World War

7717.199 --> 7722.659
freaking fake Alien Invasion I don't

7720.02 --> 7724.579000000001
know if any of that actually happens or

7722.659 --> 7729.04
that it's just there because we

7724.579 --> 7729.04
fantasize about it I don't know

7733.04 --> 7736.599
I didn't get to see it

7739.579 --> 7745.54
I just know the structures I don't know

7742.46 --> 7745.54
whether it's real or not

7750.86 --> 7754.239
dude it's getting dark

7756.02 --> 7761.38
but yeah I thank you psych Bear for the

7758.42 --> 7761.38
the nice words

7762.02 --> 7769.099
I mean I kind of do have an eye on my

7765.679 --> 7773.26
but she's not here but yeah

7769.099 --> 7773.26
my roommates like really

7775.04 --> 7780.0199999999995
really cute and I think that she thinks

7778.099 --> 7781.579
I'm a bit cute too because she makes

7780.02 --> 7784.820000000001
effort to

7781.579 --> 7787.82
make her voice attractive to me

7784.82 --> 7791.179
and it works but it's kind of like

7787.82 --> 7794.38
flirting because she has a boyfriend I

7791.179 --> 7794.38
don't even know if she

7795.679 --> 7801.619
if it's just her way of just being a

7798.56 --> 7804.679
glorious woman because she is like an

7801.619 --> 7807.199
actual glorious woman and not like Oh

7804.679 --> 7809.96
I'm a girl oh I'm so special no she's

7807.199 --> 7811.598999999999
like an actually glorious woman with a

7809.96 --> 7815.0
beautiful body

7811.599 --> 7818.119000000001
studying to be a doctor great moral

7815.0 --> 7820.099
She's Not Afraid of people with high

7818.119 --> 7823.159
energy and that get pissed off over

7820.099 --> 7827.119000000001
legitimate thing ugh

7823.159 --> 7830.799999999999
she's like the best girl candidate

7827.119 --> 7830.799999999999
I've come across since my ex

7831.079 --> 7836.86
but she has a boyfriend and she's not

7834.139 --> 7836.86
giving any

7838.219 --> 7843.139
yeah she's not like breaking up with him

7840.44 --> 7845.178999999999
or anything now that I know of I don't

7843.139 --> 7847.46
know I don't know too much I don't

7845.179 --> 7849.619
really talk about her relationship life

7847.46 --> 7851.36
too much I mostly like spend time with

7849.619 --> 7853.159
her talking about

7851.36 --> 7854.78
well her school

7853.159 --> 7857.42
and her doctor

7854.78 --> 7858.98
study because that interests me that

7857.42 --> 7861.5
actually interests me and I know stuff

7858.98 --> 7864.199
about it so to me it's kind of like a

7861.5 --> 7866.42
bit of bragging making myself more

7864.199 --> 7868.46
appealing to her

7866.42 --> 7870.4400000000005
and at the same time I'm just genuinely

7868.46 --> 7872.4800000000005
interested

7870.44 --> 7875.719
but yeah I'm kind of presenting myself

7872.48 --> 7879.138999999999
as yeah I could be your partner

7875.719 --> 7880.639
and I would like connect to your actual

7879.139 --> 7883.579
profession

7880.639 --> 7887.56
like we could make a team

7883.579 --> 7887.5599999999995
I'm I'm presenting that to her

7887.96 --> 7893.54
anyway

7889.82 --> 7897.34
maybe she'll she'll go for it

7893.54 --> 7897.34
sometimes I don't know if I'm ready

7900.86 --> 7906.88
but I do know I find her very attractive

7903.079 --> 7906.88
in all kinds of ways

7907.28 --> 7909.82
hmm

7910.52 --> 7914.540000000001
anyway geez the pauses are becoming long

7913.159 --> 7916.159
here

7914.54 --> 7919.54
is anybody still out there I'm just

7916.159 --> 7919.54
talking to Shadows now

7922.099 --> 7927.82
I am here says Jeff gas head 10 minutes

7925.46 --> 7927.82
ago

7930.86 --> 7936.46
I met mine when I was 30.

7933.86 --> 7936.46
awesome

7947.42 --> 7953.4400000000005
but I so did I that was my ex I met her

7950.48 --> 7953.44
when I was 30.

7958.82 --> 7965.259999999999
and she was 21.

7961.579 --> 7965.259999999999
oh 22. I don't know

7967.88 --> 7974.36
but the weird thing is I've even before

7971.119 --> 7977.119
my Dark World Vision thing happened I

7974.36 --> 7979.88
had very distinct dreams

7977.119 --> 7983.0199999999995
of a very specific woman

7979.88 --> 7983.02
that I've never seen

7983.719 --> 7986.8
is really odd

7986.96 --> 7993.7390000000005
but I just remembered that she was like

7990.5 --> 7996.28
really blonde like really really white

7993.739 --> 7996.28
blonde

7998.54 --> 8001.98
and I don't know if that's real

8004.179 --> 8009.579
but his death is yeah this girl is a

8006.88 --> 8012.78
redhead she's a ginger

8009.579 --> 8012.78
really awesome one

8013.599 --> 8019.659000000001
so I don't know man

8017.199 --> 8022.839999999999
maybe I'll meet her after I don't know

8019.659 --> 8025.598999999999
how this should go like every time I

8022.84 --> 8029.099
would get like actually hook up with a

8025.599 --> 8032.32
relationship Everything Changes like

8029.099 --> 8034.06
immediately everything around it's like

8032.32 --> 8036.46
the whole world becomes completely

8034.06 --> 8039.6990000000005
different and people respond differently

8036.46 --> 8041.38
to me and suddenly I'm all the hunk and

8039.699 --> 8044.259999999999
now all of a suddenly all the women want

8041.38 --> 8046.119
me and [ __ ] it's so annoying

8044.26 --> 8047.5
it's like oh everybody's kind of

8046.119 --> 8049.239
ignoring me

8047.5 --> 8051.159
and then I get a relationship and now

8049.239 --> 8052.239
they all want me it's like get the [ __ ]

8051.159 --> 8054.339999999999
out of here

8052.239 --> 8058.079
leave me the [ __ ] alone why didn't you

8054.34 --> 8058.079
come after me when I was actually alone

8063.82 --> 8070.96
I remember every woman I've ever known

8065.8 --> 8074.26
yeah so do I Jeff guessett for me

8070.96 --> 8076.119
I don't stop being in love

8074.26 --> 8080.320000000001
I don't

8076.119 --> 8084.579
I don't know why I don't it doesn't stop

8080.32 --> 8087.159
I mean at first I'm like really like

8084.579 --> 8089.619
physically ill from it where I like

8087.159 --> 8092.259999999999
throw up and [ __ ] physically ill from

8089.619 --> 8095.0199999999995
being in love first like the first two

8092.26 --> 8097.42
months for me in a relation is hell I

8095.02 --> 8100.06
don't like it because the only thing I'm

8097.42 --> 8102.28
doing is just try trying not to get sick

8100.06 --> 8106.119000000001
in front of my girlfriend

8102.28 --> 8108.82
and then after that time then act then

8106.119 --> 8112.78
it's like Legend time

8108.82 --> 8115.48
Legend time I'm so great in a

8112.78 --> 8118.96
relationship after those two months

8115.48 --> 8121.178999999999
and that never stops

8118.96 --> 8123.88
three years

8121.179 --> 8126.42
three years non-stop I lived with her it

8123.88 --> 8126.42
didn't stop

8128.5 --> 8135.82
she was not into witchcraft

8131.38 --> 8138.52
but she was connected to society [ __ ]

8135.82 --> 8139.78
I think she knew some really creepy

8138.52 --> 8141.6990000000005
people

8139.78 --> 8144.46
that she didn't typically hang around

8141.699 --> 8148.178999999999
with but hey so did I

8144.46 --> 8151.179
right Jesuit guy she knew him

8148.179 --> 8155.4
I found out afterward like after a few

8151.179 --> 8155.4
years that that was [ __ ] creepy

8159.099 --> 8163.599
that yeah it was like oh I'm gonna

8161.739 --> 8165.699
invite him or something it was

8163.599 --> 8168.099
completely crazy

8165.699 --> 8169.598999999999
didn't even remember like what I was

8168.099 --> 8171.52
doing

8169.599 --> 8173.9400000000005
and then it turned out that she kind of

8171.52 --> 8173.9400000000005
knew him

8174.219 --> 8177.0
that's crazy

8178.84 --> 8185.1990000000005
but she wasn't like a witchy type or

8181.54 --> 8187.599
anything no totally atheist like she was

8185.199 --> 8189.54
not concerned with spiritual matters at

8187.599 --> 8193.54
all like at all

8189.54 --> 8194.62
zero zero totally materialist hundred

8193.54 --> 8197.800000000001
percent

8194.62 --> 8200.2
still subtle and feelings but she was

8197.8 --> 8200.92
just not interested at all in all that

8200.2 --> 8204.04
stuff

8200.92 --> 8206.2
I was I kept it to myself and she was

8204.04 --> 8209.319000000001
kind of happy that I was because then I

8206.2 --> 8211.240000000002
she kind of used me

8209.319 --> 8213.34
when those kind of things got involved

8211.24 --> 8216.699999999999
it she asked me

8213.34 --> 8220.179
right but she just she was like a

8216.7 --> 8224.26
material girl in a material world

8220.179 --> 8226.899
very good at it and still like decently

8224.26 --> 8228.34
human like she was still a decent human

8226.899 --> 8230.619999999999
overall

8228.34 --> 8233.5
it's just that she

8230.62 --> 8236.26
deep down she was raised to be decent

8233.5 --> 8237.819
she didn't actually care about people

8236.26 --> 8240.76
too much

8237.819 --> 8243.039999999999
except for her friends

8240.76 --> 8244.599
but she was kind of like yeah [ __ ] them

8243.04 --> 8246.519
all like

8244.599 --> 8250.479
yeah they're all gonna die

8246.519 --> 8253.66
oh yeah Eugenics why not not that she

8250.479 --> 8257.34
would like bring it up but if you asked

8253.66 --> 8257.34
she just didn't care

8258.34 --> 8261.0
weird

8264.16 --> 8270.46
material it yeah but look

8267.54 --> 8273.219000000001
Material Girl Madonna yeah that's not

8270.46 --> 8275.38
that's not even really material

8273.219 --> 8278.08
I'm not talking about disgusting

8275.38 --> 8280.539999999999
luciferian oh it's all about me I just

8278.08 --> 8281.92
want more stuff not that kind of

8280.54 --> 8285.660000000002
materialist

8281.92 --> 8285.66
she just wasn't spiritual

8286.12 --> 8290.979000000001
I think she was kind of broken like that

8287.859 --> 8294.04
she had like big daddy issues too

8290.979 --> 8296.438999999998
and she mostly just responded to those

8294.04 --> 8299.639000000001
types of issues by

8296.439 --> 8299.639000000001
forgetting about it

8300.34 --> 8306.54
she was not very spiritually confrontive

8302.859 --> 8306.54
or confrontive at all

8307.479 --> 8310.719
and it worked really well for her

8309.28 --> 8314.399000000001
because she was really freaking

8310.719 --> 8314.399
attractive and she could just like

8314.679 --> 8320.439
compose a face that would just totally

8317.92 --> 8322.54
distract everybody she could like

8320.439 --> 8324.58
literally magic her way out of a

8322.54 --> 8327.399000000001
situation just by putting on a face

8324.58 --> 8331.019
really

8327.399 --> 8331.019
it's really [ __ ] hot

8334.0 --> 8338.08
I have convinced you're putting a pizza

8335.8 --> 8339.518999999998
in the oven I still got two parts but I

8338.08 --> 8341.2
gotta reheat them

8339.519 --> 8344.08
but I am gonna round out the show

8341.2 --> 8346.599
because I need to get my bike

8344.08 --> 8349.019
need to get my bike back from the repair

8346.599 --> 8349.019
shop

8349.84 --> 8352.319
right

8353.679 --> 8359.04
Get Wrecked on a Fiverr

8356.439 --> 8359.04
what

8360.099 --> 8367.319
right but yeah again she was not into

8362.92 --> 8367.319
witchcraft but she did know people

8367.78 --> 8375.460000000001
like she was the type to actually

8371.92 --> 8378.460000000001
not shy away from really dark

8375.46 --> 8378.46
Lords

8379.359 --> 8383.139000000001
and that was actually really fascinating

8381.7 --> 8386.019
to me

8383.139 --> 8389.619999999999
because I had the same issue

8386.019 --> 8391.06
with me however it was because I was a

8389.62 --> 8394.560000000001
[ __ ] fool

8391.06 --> 8394.56
I was deluding myself

8395.979 --> 8401.619999999999
with her I think that she's just been

8399.34 --> 8403.479
involved

8401.62 --> 8406.060000000001
with things that she shouldn't be

8403.479 --> 8408.899
involved with

8406.06 --> 8408.899
at some point

8412.6 --> 8418.140000000001
because yeah I'm talking way too much I

8415.42 --> 8418.14
shouldn't

8419.74 --> 8423.96
but it's yeah still a big puzzle to me

8425.14 --> 8431.5
foreign

8427.2 --> 8433.960000000001
s about her no proof no real proof only

8431.5 --> 8436.479
spiritual

8433.96 --> 8437.438999999998
also because she was also in the Dark

8436.479 --> 8440.199999999999
World

8437.439 --> 8444.720000000001
when I got there like she was there and

8440.2 --> 8444.720000000001
she was conscious that's a bad sign

8444.819 --> 8451.439
like good people are usually not aware

8447.34 --> 8451.439
of the Dark World in my experience

8451.899 --> 8456.64
don't forget to lock that back yeah

8465.939 --> 8473.26
my Taiwanese wife

8469.24 --> 8477.399
portion of emotion jealous lashes out of

8473.26 --> 8480.399
but very spiritual just very passionate

8477.399 --> 8483.279999999999
very passionate woman

8480.399 --> 8485.68
little little fiery woman

8483.28 --> 8487.84
Taiwanese

8485.68 --> 8492.12
cool

8487.84 --> 8492.12
yeah I can appreciate that in a woman

8494.2 --> 8499.0
as long as they

8496.06 --> 8501.399
do actually listen right passion women

8499.0 --> 8503.5
are great as long as they actually do

8501.399 --> 8505.599999999999
still communicate if they completely

8503.5 --> 8508.24
close themselves up and it's just all

8505.6 --> 8511.960000000001
about them it's a nightmare that's like

8508.24 --> 8514.0
terrible that's like sjw [ __ ]

8511.96 --> 8515.56
I want nothing to do with those types of

8514.0 --> 8519.04
women but yeah if they're just really

8515.56 --> 8521.56
passionate and sensitive yeah that's

8519.04 --> 8525.580000000002
just those type of women get things

8521.56 --> 8528.0
going like they actually wake you up I

8525.58 --> 8528.0
like that

8529.24 --> 8535.24
yeah my ex was more stoic

8532.12 --> 8536.68
I was the one I'm the one doing that I'm

8535.24 --> 8539.08
like that

8536.68 --> 8540.819
emotional

8539.08 --> 8543.64
and all that

8540.819 --> 8545.74
and passionate and I get things moving

8543.64 --> 8548.68
and I'm very spiritual

8545.74 --> 8551.26
but yeah my ex was much more just like a

8548.68 --> 8553.78
stoic model that was just like oh my God

8551.26 --> 8558.54
so freaking amazing

8553.78 --> 8558.54
just like oh look at her oh my God

8558.64 --> 8564.16
that was it to me

8561.34 --> 8568.08
she was like a bit of a like a trophy in

8564.16 --> 8568.08
a way I was so proud of her

8575.08 --> 8579.46
I mean come on

8577.66 --> 8581.64
now I'm not gonna go through all that

8579.46 --> 8581.64

8582.76 --> 8588.16

8599.02 --> 8602.02

8605.38 --> 8611.099999999999
