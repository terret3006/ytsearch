177.04 --> 183.12
yesterday and i'm very thankful

180.8 --> 183.12
ugh

183.28 --> 187.68
anyway the weather today is

185.55 --> 190.56
[Music]

187.68 --> 190.56
camera freeze

196.159 --> 203.67999999999998
weather today is sunny

200.239 --> 206.08
a bit cloudy it's weird there have been

203.68 --> 208.64000000000001
trails left

206.08 --> 211.04000000000002
and like a few hours ago two hours ago

208.64 --> 211.92
it was pretty cloudy

211.04 --> 216.0
but

211.92 --> 216.0
it's kind of hold on i guess

216.08 --> 221.04000000000002
still clouds around

217.76 --> 221.04
they're not very big and

224.84 --> 230.4
yeah

226.72 --> 230.4
it's still pretty beautiful outside

232.48 --> 236.439
plenty of warm i bet

240.799 --> 244.239
oh

242.0 --> 244.239
yep

248.959 --> 254.64000000000001
hello pjcnet first in chat good to see

251.68 --> 256.40000000000003
you gadget inspector hello

254.64 --> 260.759
it is monday

256.4 --> 260.75899999999996
the 8th of august 2022

261.759 --> 265.72
and uh yeah

268.88 --> 275.84
i'm pretty shaken up and well yeah a bit

273.52 --> 278.24
i mean yesterday i was like really on

275.84 --> 278.23999999999995
fire

279.12 --> 284.4
but not necessarily intended nor to be

282.72 --> 285.6
taken literally

284.4 --> 288.56
but uh

285.6 --> 290.40000000000003
yeah yesterday was heavy

288.56 --> 291.84
my show i watched it back and it was

290.4 --> 294.08
really like

291.84 --> 294.08
well

294.96 --> 299.44
man

297.199 --> 302.0
it's weird it's weird to

299.44 --> 302.0
see that

302.08 --> 306.0
see yourself

303.36 --> 306.0
doing that

308.08 --> 311.84
but yeah i think i

312.0 --> 316.479
like i i

313.919 --> 317.44
it's it's very weird to even analyze

316.479 --> 320.08
that

317.44 --> 321.52
it's really it really is like what am i

320.08 --> 325.52
doing i'm

321.52 --> 329.35999999999996
being extremely intense i'm

325.52 --> 329.35999999999996
i'm breaking boundaries

330.56 --> 333.36
i really am

334.4 --> 339.84
and i'm not entirely sure like even if

337.039 --> 339.84
it's

341.36 --> 347.039
it's like i don't i'm not i'm not sure

345.12 --> 349.6
if it's gonna be effective

347.039 --> 353.15999999999997
not that whether it is good or bad what

349.6 --> 353.16
i do i mean

353.6 --> 359.199
it is all very well explained and

355.759 --> 361.6
straightforward and i'm honest about

359.199 --> 363.759
all these conclusions

361.6 --> 367.84000000000003
but whether it is effective is another

363.759 --> 367.84000000000003
matter i don't know i don't know

368.639 --> 373.879
only time will tell

370.67 --> 373.879
[Music]

374.639 --> 378.72
i mean

375.919 --> 380.88
who knows maybe in like

378.72 --> 383.52000000000004
five years or something

380.88 --> 385.52
i will just feel really stupid

383.52 --> 386.96
and people will be like oh that arwen

385.52 --> 388.56
and his

386.96 --> 390.96
aggression talks

388.56 --> 393.36
how pointless was that we've managed to

390.96 --> 396.479
fix this entire situation just with our

393.36 --> 399.6
peaceful protest and our resilience and

396.479 --> 401.28
creativity and our good spirit and

399.6 --> 405.28000000000003
merriment

401.28 --> 405.28
despite the globalist well

405.44 --> 408.96
i kind of hope i am wrong

407.6 --> 412.319
and i hope that

408.96 --> 416.4
it'll all work out it's just that

412.319 --> 416.40000000000003
patterns aren't exactly showing

418.479 --> 424.15999999999997
right it feels it all feels more like

421.28 --> 428.08
people are just doing their best

424.16 --> 428.08000000000004
in the face of a hopeless situation

428.479 --> 435.44
and just holding out with like

431.599 --> 438.24
great confidence and bravery but

435.44 --> 442.4
it it just doesn't feel like this is

438.24 --> 442.40000000000003
actually gonna work so far

443.44 --> 448.71999999999997
there seems to be

445.039 --> 451.759
like equal measured opposite

448.72 --> 453.199
counteractions and slander like the the

451.759 --> 454.639
swastikas

453.199 --> 457.68
and [ __ ]

454.639 --> 460.88
and just it's just keeping going it's

457.68 --> 460.88
like they don't give a [ __ ]

461.28 --> 465.67999999999995
politicians and the cons the

463.199 --> 467.84000000000003
conspirators the open conspirators they

465.68 --> 470.639
don't really care and that's

467.84 --> 470.63899999999995
why i then

471.599 --> 476.96
do what i do

474.0 --> 480.24
because it has to be resolved one way or

476.96 --> 482.31899999999996
the other it has to be resolved

480.24 --> 484.0
right

482.319 --> 486.96000000000004
but yeah it feels

484.0 --> 489.28
it is unnerving like oh yeah i did that

486.96 --> 489.28
okay

489.36 --> 493.40000000000003
i mean

490.4 --> 493.4
i

494.879 --> 499.28000000000003
yeah

496.479 --> 502.08
it's just weird being me

499.28 --> 506.919
anyway uh

502.08 --> 506.919
that is still a pretty good hangout and

507.84 --> 512.24
i haven't actually fought finished

509.68 --> 514.719
watching it it cut got to like

512.24 --> 516.5600000000001
two-thirds and then

514.719 --> 519.12
stopped but i know that the last third

516.56 --> 522.0
was also very good

519.12 --> 523.76
focused a lot on language and all that

522.0 --> 526.399
so maybe i gotta finish watching that

523.76 --> 527.8389999999999
too but anyway i watched it back and it

526.399 --> 529.92
was yeah

527.839 --> 531.519
pretty astounding and

529.92 --> 533.5999999999999
i'm just wondering

531.519 --> 535.44
about

533.6 --> 539.12
i really hope

535.44 --> 539.12
that that i'm doing this

539.68 --> 544.56
well not for good reason because i am

542.16 --> 546.48
but that it will actually

544.56 --> 550.2399999999999
turn out to be

546.48 --> 550.24
effective as i hoped

552.48 --> 554.9590000000001
anyway

559.36 --> 565.76
anybody else out there it's been seven

562.16 --> 569.4399999999999
minutes since somebody has said anything

565.76 --> 569.4399999999999
this is one of those silent mondays

569.519 --> 571.92
anyway

575.6 --> 581.76
so yeah plenty of complaints and oh

578.64 --> 584.24
reported reported or when reported oh

581.76 --> 586.64
yes oh yes of course reporting well it's

584.24 --> 590.48
still there it's still there it didn't

586.64 --> 593.1999999999999
it's not even demonetized huh huh what

590.48 --> 598.72
do you think about that scumbags

593.2 --> 600.8000000000001
the video isn't even demonetized

598.72 --> 601.9200000000001
huh

600.8 --> 604.7199999999999
oh

601.92 --> 605.68
how's your power holding up how's your

604.72 --> 607.839
your

605.68 --> 610.16
your elbowing power oh you don't like it

607.839 --> 612.9590000000001
oh you can use the system to silence it

610.16 --> 614.079
how is it working out for you huh

612.959 --> 616.3199999999999
huh

614.079 --> 617.4399999999999
oh you think you can intimidate me some

616.32 --> 619.12
more

617.44 --> 621.36
no no

619.12 --> 624.8
no you can't

621.36 --> 628.72
i'll i'll do it even more

624.8 --> 631.3599999999999
i'll do it even more and it will be

628.72 --> 633.9200000000001
right there on my channel and it won't

631.36 --> 637.279
even be demonetized not like yesterday's

633.92 --> 641.3199999999999
show not like the show two days before

637.279 --> 641.32
and all those others

642.5 --> 645.7
[Music]

652.0 --> 656.079
what do you hope will happen with flood

654.079 --> 657.04
earth

656.079 --> 658.399
abs

657.04 --> 660.64
well

658.399 --> 662.8
it will just go on as it does there will

660.64 --> 664.48
be more people that will get into flat

662.8 --> 665.92
earth and then there will be more

664.48 --> 667.9200000000001
ballers

665.92 --> 670.16
and anti-flat earthers standing up to

667.92 --> 671.8389999999999
try and counter that or go into

670.16 --> 673.68
discussions with that and then it's

671.839 --> 674.399
going to be bound and keep going just

673.68 --> 676.959
like

674.399 --> 678.8
we have with the flat earth debates and

676.959 --> 680.56
other groups it's just going to keep

678.8 --> 684.3199999999999
going and going and going it's going to

680.56 --> 684.3199999999999
be probably a standard

686.16 --> 688.88
thing

687.2 --> 690.32
like

688.88 --> 692.24
oh yeah

690.32 --> 693.839
people discussing flat earth in the ball

692.24 --> 696.16
like that's going to keep going for a

693.839 --> 698.0
long long long time

696.16 --> 700.24
it's going to be there to reflect upon

698.0 --> 702.48
to realize to awaken

700.24 --> 706.0
or to brace against it

702.48 --> 708.5600000000001
and that'll just be the way it is for a

706.0 --> 708.56
long time

709.92 --> 713.1999999999999
i hate youtube and their censorship good

712.16 --> 718.3199999999999
to see

713.2 --> 718.32
you're avoiding it am i pjc net

719.12 --> 724.0
am i avoiding it i mean

722.0 --> 727.279
it's not like i'm

724.0 --> 730.24
oh i'm holding back

727.279 --> 733.12
in order to prevent oh no youtube might

730.24 --> 734.8
not like what i say oh yeah no

733.12 --> 737.04
no

734.8 --> 739.3599999999999
i mean i'm not gonna be like oh this is

737.04 --> 741.4399999999999
the current thing oh the current thing

739.36 --> 743.519
oh they don't want you to talk about

741.44 --> 746.0
this so i am going to make a special

743.519 --> 747.92
video about it right now because that's

746.0 --> 750.88
how you get removed that's how you get

747.92 --> 752.959
censored then they're like hey

750.88 --> 754.639
we don't want you to do that that

752.959 --> 756.56
specifically it's not even about the

754.639 --> 759.519
information it's about the timing of the

756.56 --> 761.68
information they don't want you to do it

759.519 --> 764.48
right when the spell is going

761.68 --> 766.56
and by the way for the record i learned

764.48 --> 768.88
this very specifically

766.56 --> 771.4399999999999
from owen benjamin

768.88 --> 773.68
who did an entire item about this like a

771.44 --> 776.72
half a year ago or a year ago

773.68 --> 778.0
and that was really really hit the spot

776.72 --> 779.2
it really

778.0 --> 781.44
made sense

779.2 --> 784.0
it's how it works and ever since i

781.44 --> 784.0
learned that

784.079 --> 788.56
i've been focusing on that

786.959 --> 791.5999999999999
to just do it

788.56 --> 794.4799999999999
that like don't be the current thing

791.6 --> 798.32
protester don't go ruining spells right

794.48 --> 800.8000000000001
as they're desperately being unfolded

798.32 --> 803.519
right that's why i don't do it also be

800.8 --> 806.079
very careful with your titles with your

803.519 --> 808.9590000000001
show titles because it seems like

806.079 --> 810.2399999999999
reporting and strikes and all that are

808.959 --> 812.2399999999999
much more

810.24 --> 813.76
based on titles

812.24 --> 815.04
than it is content first they look at

813.76 --> 816.8
the title

815.04 --> 818.48
then they might do something about it

816.8 --> 819.76
and then when they choose to do

818.48 --> 823.04
something about it that's when they're

819.76 --> 829.16
actually gonna look at the video

823.04 --> 829.16
that's how it seems to work

832.959 --> 837.279
hey lsg good to see you

835.44 --> 840.0
thank you so much again for the paypal

837.279 --> 843.24
donation yesterday it arrived today so

840.0 --> 843.24
it's amazing

843.44 --> 847.2790000000001
and i got some good food

847.839 --> 852.24
for tonight i'm looking forward to it

852.48 --> 858.24
expecting space agency from locals of

855.519 --> 859.6
course well maybe professor filbell

858.24 --> 862.48
maybe

859.6 --> 864.9590000000001
for the time being they will

862.48 --> 866.9590000000001
allegedly do that

864.959 --> 868.399
but

866.959 --> 871.04
they're going to just try to make it

868.399 --> 872.32
cheaper and cheaper

871.04 --> 874.639
and that will

872.32 --> 877.12
well kind of obvious to me

874.639 --> 879.199
imply that eventually they're just going

877.12 --> 881.279
to show you cgi of supposed rocket

879.199 --> 883.519
launches and that's it it's just going

881.279 --> 884.639
to be cgi they will not even

883.519 --> 887.04
expand

884.639 --> 889.279
expend any materials

887.04 --> 891.5999999999999
on those types of events anymore it will

889.279 --> 894.0
just cut that part out so to make it

891.6 --> 896.48
cheap and then they can

894.0 --> 899.72
roll out a cgi space launch whenever

896.48 --> 899.72
they want

902.32 --> 906.839
hey rob h good to see you cleary

913.12 --> 917.76
space agency to launch that nobody

915.76 --> 919.519
launches satellites

917.76 --> 922.639
they let up

919.519 --> 925.279
satellites set loons at best

922.639 --> 927.199
nobody is sending satellites anywhere

925.279 --> 929.519
that's a lie

927.199 --> 931.279
they never did

929.519 --> 935.839
there's no

931.279 --> 939.16
pieces of machinery hanging in

935.839 --> 939.1600000000001
in a void

941.36 --> 946.8000000000001
yes oh yes it costs a lot of money that

943.759 --> 950.399
makes it real no that makes it a really

946.8 --> 952.7199999999999
well earning scam professor phil

950.399 --> 954.399
yeah oh it costs so much yeah yeah yeah

952.72 --> 955.279
somebody's receiving that money all

954.399 --> 957.6
right

955.279 --> 960.32
but they're not spending it

957.6 --> 962.32
on the alleged thing you're paying it

960.32 --> 965.32
for though

962.32 --> 965.32
huh

968.56 --> 974.01
hey george sanford

970.91 --> 974.01
[Music]

994.72 --> 997.72
uh

999.279 --> 1004.16
right so yeah

1002.079 --> 1006.2399999999999
yesterday i bumped into an interesting

1004.16 --> 1008.959
series on netflix

1006.24 --> 1010.72
the sandman

1008.959 --> 1013.199
it's

1010.72 --> 1015.519
it's kind of weird in the sense that

1013.199 --> 1017.3599999999999
it's sort of gothic

1015.519 --> 1019.36
but

1017.36 --> 1020.32
in an interesting way

1019.36 --> 1022.48
and

1020.32 --> 1025.1200000000001
it is a

1022.48 --> 1026.0
it's a series

1025.12 --> 1028.559
but

1026.0 --> 1030.959
if you look into the series and what's

1028.559 --> 1033.199
happening very carefully you'll discover

1030.959 --> 1033.199
that

1035.12 --> 1040.1599999999999
it's all based on

1037.36 --> 1042.7199999999998
greek mythology

1040.16 --> 1042.72
pantheon

1042.799 --> 1046.319
and

1043.6 --> 1048.48
yeah it's about the main character

1046.319 --> 1050.84
morpheus remember

1048.48 --> 1052.48
remember when i

1050.84 --> 1053.76
reviewed

1052.48 --> 1056.64
on my show

1053.76 --> 1058.48
bloody zeus and i told them told you

1056.64 --> 1059.76
about oh

1058.48 --> 1062.24
holy [ __ ]

1059.76 --> 1065.2
they they like read it out and then like

1062.24 --> 1066.88
presented the demons or it's not demons

1065.2 --> 1070.0
the

1066.88 --> 1070.0
the spirits

1070.64 --> 1074.4
that were let the dark forces that were

1072.48 --> 1076.799
left and morpheus

1074.4 --> 1078.3200000000002
lord of dreams was among that well guess

1076.799 --> 1082.0
what

1078.32 --> 1085.12
the sandman this series is literally

1082.0 --> 1087.44
about morpheus the lord of dreams and

1085.12 --> 1090.1599999999999
they really do their best

1087.44 --> 1093.3600000000001
to take that serious

1090.16 --> 1095.52
and sit by that standard the main actor

1093.36 --> 1098.6399999999999
that actually plays him

1095.52 --> 1101.6
as a pretty damn tough job

1098.64 --> 1104.3200000000002
to basically fill that role but

1101.6 --> 1106.7199999999998
i've gotten through three episodes and

1104.32 --> 1110.1599999999999
it seems like

1106.72 --> 1112.0
it's not absolutely perfect but yeah how

1110.16 --> 1116.96
would you even do that and

1112.0 --> 1119.679
it seems to be varying decently well

1116.96 --> 1123.1200000000001
it's extremely tough of course like the

1119.679 --> 1124.72
freaking lord of dreams like

1123.12 --> 1125.4399999999998
i don't even understand why they give

1124.72 --> 1128.88
him

1125.44 --> 1130.799
a human visage of any sort really what

1128.88 --> 1133.6000000000001
they did and

1130.799 --> 1136.96
it's fascinating also

1133.6 --> 1138.32
dude they have some serious dnd lore in

1136.96 --> 1140.48
this thing

1138.32 --> 1143.76
they literally bring out a summoning

1140.48 --> 1145.679
circle and like dude

1143.76 --> 1148.16
read

1145.679 --> 1150.96
read my dnd book read my trolls and

1148.16 --> 1154.72
tyrants it's like i made a very special

1150.96 --> 1157.6000000000001
section about summoning circles and like

1154.72 --> 1160.799
i i made it into a much more serious

1157.6 --> 1162.8799999999999
mechanical thing in the game

1160.799 --> 1165.52
and it seems like

1162.88 --> 1168.4
like they actually took it serious to

1165.52 --> 1172.24
that level and it's like wow

1168.4 --> 1176.24
i was basically squirting

1172.24 --> 1179.84
as a dnd game master watching those some

1176.24 --> 1181.919
of those scenes it's just like wow

1179.84 --> 1183.9189999999999
wow

1181.919 --> 1186.72
so yeah and so far i'm extremely

1183.919 --> 1188.96
impressed it is very dark though in many

1186.72 --> 1192.16
ways and gothic and

1188.96 --> 1193.039
evil like there's absolutely evil people

1192.16 --> 1195.6000000000001
in there

1193.039 --> 1198.799
like evil occultists and all that that

1195.6 --> 1200.32
that and like yeah the the actor

1198.799 --> 1202.24
you get to see him very quickly so it's

1200.32 --> 1204.24
not really a spoiler

1202.24 --> 1208.32
it's his name again it's my one of my

1204.24 --> 1210.64
favorite actors who also played

1208.32 --> 1212.32
what is it

1210.64 --> 1217.2
the great

1212.32 --> 1220.24
the great general in game of thrones

1217.2 --> 1222.4
and he fills that role magnificently

1220.24 --> 1224.48
unfortunately he doesn't hang around

1222.4 --> 1227.6000000000001
very long

1224.48 --> 1227.6
but god

1228.4 --> 1231.52
very

1229.36 --> 1233.4399999999998
very interesting series

1231.52 --> 1236.96
so far

1233.44 --> 1240.2
dark but extremely interesting uh

1236.96 --> 1240.2
let's see

1245.81 --> 1248.8999999999999
[Music]

1250.48 --> 1254.4
let me quickly get the name

1258.799 --> 1263.2
yeah charles dance that's him he's in

1262.32 --> 1265.9189999999999
this

1263.2 --> 1267.919
god this guy is magnificent

1265.919 --> 1270.48
i've never seen him in a single movie

1267.919 --> 1272.159
where he isn't just freaking epic

1270.48 --> 1274.4
and everything

1272.159 --> 1276.4
this is everything

1274.4 --> 1277.44
but yeah he's in this too

1276.4 --> 1279.52
in the first

1277.44 --> 1282.96
part of it

1279.52 --> 1282.96
it is really something

1287.039 --> 1291.44
oh you watch the whole thing mike's no

1288.96 --> 1293.6000000000001
spoilers for me i still gotta continue

1291.44 --> 1298.6000000000001
watching

1293.6 --> 1298.6
but man i'm so impressed so far

1304.64 --> 1310.159
so yeah that was a very nice and

1306.4 --> 1310.159
pleasant distraction after my

1310.72 --> 1316.88
dark outburst yesterday

1313.919 --> 1320.48
is it even that dark

1316.88 --> 1320.48
it is dark to some degree

1330.64 --> 1338.0800000000002
josh george said is phil bell's still

1334.4 --> 1338.0800000000002
about to set the lights really

1342.0 --> 1345.72
oh my god

1346.4 --> 1350.4
uh

1348.0 --> 1352.88
yeah i'm afraid professor field well

1350.4 --> 1358.0800000000002
it's in reality it's actually really

1352.88 --> 1359.2
cheap to have a presupposed satellite

1358.08 --> 1360.3999999999999
you just

1359.2 --> 1363.3600000000001
take a

1360.4 --> 1364.88
transmitter and you install it on a

1363.36 --> 1367.1999999999998
radio tower

1364.88 --> 1369.3600000000001
done there's your satellite it's

1367.2 --> 1372.88
extremely cheap

1369.36 --> 1372.8799999999999
extremely cheap

1373.039 --> 1377.84
because it is literally just hanging a

1375.2 --> 1380.4
transmitter on a radio tower that's a

1377.84 --> 1381.12
satellite that's what it is

1380.4 --> 1383.1200000000001
or

1381.12 --> 1384.8799999999999
even lamer

1383.12 --> 1386.799
the transmitter is already there and

1384.88 --> 1390.96
then it's just like oh

1386.799 --> 1390.96
turn it on on this frequency

1391.36 --> 1395.76
and then oh we got satellite contact yes

1393.76 --> 1397.52
yes because it's been turned on it was

1395.76 --> 1399.28
just there

1397.52 --> 1400.6399999999999
either freshly installed or it was

1399.28 --> 1405.0
always there and they just turn it on

1400.64 --> 1405.0
for you that's how it really works

1406.63 --> 1409.8990000000001
[Music]

1414.14 --> 1420.159
[Music]

1416.0 --> 1420.159
most expensive [ __ ] service

1424.88 --> 1428.24
is it even george sanford i don't know

1427.2 --> 1433.039
is it

1428.24 --> 1435.919
is satellite communication really that

1433.039 --> 1435.919
that shitty

1438.72 --> 1441.279
i don't know

1441.6 --> 1444.6
uh

1452.72 --> 1455.72
hmm

1479.52 --> 1482.52
so

1489.6 --> 1495.52
there aren't any professor phil bell

1493.039 --> 1498.08
you're literally conjuring up something

1495.52 --> 1500.08
that just is not

1498.08 --> 1501.9189999999999
doing that

1500.08 --> 1503.52
yeah when you're seeing lights in the

1501.919 --> 1505.8400000000001
sky

1503.52 --> 1508.1589999999999
those aren't things that are moving as

1505.84 --> 1510.8799999999999
you say 10 times faster than any fighter

1508.159 --> 1514.0
jet that's just [ __ ] nonsense

1510.88 --> 1515.3600000000001
it is literal nonsense

1514.0 --> 1518.48
is just you

1515.36 --> 1520.3999999999999
presupposing it's 10 times

1518.48 --> 1522.799
further away

1520.4 --> 1524.48
than the typical fighter jet yeah that's

1522.799 --> 1526.84
what you're literally doing you don't

1524.48 --> 1529.76
have proof that there's actually that

1526.84 --> 1533.279
distance it could literally just be 10

1529.76 --> 1536.24
fighter jets in formation or well drones

1533.279 --> 1538.32
huh drones it's just drones

1536.24 --> 1540.72
like

1538.32 --> 1542.48
drones

1540.72 --> 1543.84
yeah and they can be made to fly in

1542.48 --> 1546.32
formation

1543.84 --> 1548.32
it's like this flock

1546.32 --> 1550.32
dynamic

1548.32 --> 1553.039
right it's been demonstrated

1550.32 --> 1555.12
a lot like even 10 years ago they were

1553.039 --> 1556.96
able to do that you just take basic

1555.12 --> 1559.52
drones and then you can make them fly

1556.96 --> 1564.159
like a swarm and have like perfect

1559.52 --> 1564.1589999999999
formation yeah you do it with drones

1564.24 --> 1569.2
yeah you can do it with like propeller

1567.2 --> 1571.279
helicopter like drones or you could do

1569.2 --> 1573.2
it with like the typical

1571.279 --> 1575.039
air strike drones

1573.2 --> 1576.72
and they were probably those who were 10

1575.039 --> 1578.24
airstrike type drones and they were just

1576.72 --> 1579.679
flying information

1578.24 --> 1582.559
oh so

1579.679 --> 1584.48
difficult oh no it has to go ten times

1582.559 --> 1586.3999999999999
as fast as fighter jets because i

1584.48 --> 1587.279
suppose it's gonna be 10 times further

1586.4 --> 1591.64
away

1587.279 --> 1591.64
because i'm a presupposing idiot

1593.59 --> 1603.839
[Music]

1607.44 --> 1612.039
do you see them no you don't

1617.84 --> 1621.52
no you don't

1619.279 --> 1623.679
professor phil you don't

1621.52 --> 1626.72
you have no evidence that it's even the

1623.679 --> 1628.799
same thing you're looking at then

1626.72 --> 1631.2
uk and australia

1628.799 --> 1634.36
you have absolutely no evidence for any

1631.2 --> 1634.3600000000001
of that

1645.36 --> 1650.9599999999998
it can be you already back that up boom

1648.24 --> 1653.52
you [ __ ] [ __ ]

1650.96 --> 1656.559

1656.559 --> 1661.6
and nag

1659.12 --> 1664.0
knack my chat participants

1661.6 --> 1665.4399999999998
when i'm actually also addressing the

1664.0 --> 1667.679
subject

1665.44 --> 1669.8400000000001
that is being discussed and i already

1667.679 --> 1674.799
answered that you're not gonna pull it

1669.84 --> 1678.08
out of matthew hall i've already said it

1674.799 --> 1678.08
i gave you the details

1678.64 --> 1683.679
and you're gonna stop nagging my chat

1680.559 --> 1687.6
participants about that that question

1683.679 --> 1691.159
that i the show host verbally audibly

1687.6 --> 1691.1589999999999
already answered

1691.36 --> 1698.119
[Music]

1700.48 --> 1703.2
it can be no

1702.24 --> 1706.24
you

1703.2 --> 1707.919
cannot have satellites objects don't

1706.24 --> 1709.679
float

1707.919 --> 1710.96
they don't float

1709.679 --> 1712.3990000000001
unless

1710.96 --> 1714.0
there's something

1712.399 --> 1717.12
that prevents their

1714.0 --> 1721.08
relative density this equilibrium force

1717.12 --> 1721.08
from pulling them down

1737.039 --> 1740.399
yeah it's a bit of jumping to

1738.24 --> 1742.0
conclusions there matthew hall he

1740.399 --> 1744.0
doesn't sound

1742.0 --> 1748.84
anything like jose

1744.0 --> 1748.84
jose doesn't inquire like this

1766.399 --> 1769.399
hmm

1797.76 --> 1800.76
man

1814.159 --> 1818.0800000000002
oh well maybe you should just stop

1816.72 --> 1819.679
whining

1818.08 --> 1823.84
boom

1819.679 --> 1823.8400000000001

1868.48 --> 1871.519
then i ban you

1877.279 --> 1883.679
yeah you don't have a right as a ball

1880.72 --> 1886.64
nonsense believer to be in my chat per

1883.679 --> 1890.48
default you only have that right

1886.64 --> 1890.48
if you don't act like a [ __ ]

1890.72 --> 1895.2
yeah i know that's not what you're used

1892.799 --> 1897.76
to you're used to be able to act like a

1895.2 --> 1898.96
[ __ ] everywhere because that's normal

1897.76 --> 1902.1589999999999
for you

1898.96 --> 1902.159
not in my chat though

1904.24 --> 1907.76
yeah i know pjc that

1918.159 --> 1922.3990000000001
i know matthew hall this i don't give a

1920.72 --> 1924.32
[ __ ] if that's what they're about then

1922.399 --> 1926.399
yeah you're banned

1924.32 --> 1928.6399999999999
yeah you don't have a right to be in my

1926.399 --> 1931.6789999999999
chat

1928.64 --> 1934.159
it's a privilege and if you violate that

1931.679 --> 1936.5590000000002
privilege given to you by me the show

1934.159 --> 1936.5590000000002
host

1936.72 --> 1939.919
then

1937.679 --> 1942.3200000000002
you can get the [ __ ] out

1939.919 --> 1944.96
i have no problem banning all your stock

1942.32 --> 1945.76
accounts i mean i on average i ban about

1944.96 --> 1946.8400000000001
like

1945.76 --> 1950.559
five to

1946.84 --> 1953.039
twenty sock trolls every show

1950.559 --> 1955.9189999999999
you think you think that's like oh man

1953.039 --> 1957.44
no no not another one dude this is

1955.919 --> 1961.159
routine

1957.44 --> 1961.159
i don't give a [ __ ]

1965.5 --> 1968.619
[Music]

1973.039 --> 1977.84
huh that's a good one johnson fitzgerald

1975.519 --> 1977.84
thank you

1978.399 --> 1984.4799999999998
somebody is actually technologically in

1981.039 --> 1985.84
the know of how these devices work

1984.48 --> 1988.64
yeah

1985.84 --> 1991.6789999999999
i mean theoretically even they're the

1988.64 --> 1995.2
theoretical mc or the engineering side

1991.679 --> 1997.6000000000001
of a lot of these supposed space

1995.2 --> 2001.2
situations and satellites none of it

1997.6 --> 2003.12
makes any technological sense

2001.2 --> 2005.519
it's actually not

2003.12 --> 2008.9599999999998
meant to be able to work

2005.519 --> 2010.159
it's meant for you to not look into so

2008.96 --> 2013.279
you can just

2010.159 --> 2016.3200000000002
read it and believe it

2013.279 --> 2020.399
it's there and it's wrong for you to be

2016.32 --> 2024.0
lazy and fooled and complacent

2020.399 --> 2024.8799999999999
and to blabber on like a sheep

2024.0 --> 2025.919
yeah

2024.88 --> 2029.1200000000001
just

2025.919 --> 2029.1200000000001
repeating what is told

2030.32 --> 2035.6789999999999
if you're actually technologically

2032.64 --> 2038.3990000000001
capable and you know about the mc the

2035.679 --> 2040.96
mechanisms that are involved

2038.399 --> 2043.84
then you could indeed figure out that

2040.96 --> 2045.8400000000001
the suggestion

2043.84 --> 2050.3199999999997
the suggestions they even give of what

2045.84 --> 2050.3199999999997
they're doing is mechanically impossible

2050.56 --> 2058.04
a lot of the times so thank you for that

2053.919 --> 2058.04
little detail johnson fitzgerald

2075.839 --> 2081.44
yep that's right george sanford it was

2079.76 --> 2083.599
it was amazing

2081.44 --> 2085.119
but yes

2083.599 --> 2089.839
radio

2085.119 --> 2089.839
information transfer sound transfer

2091.839 --> 2097.92
it was probably discovered sort of

2095.119 --> 2100.88
unofficially a long time ago

2097.92 --> 2103.52
probably already 19th century

2100.88 --> 2105.52
and then they kind of just like secretly

2103.52 --> 2107.7599999999998
use it was like their little magic it's

2105.52 --> 2109.92
like oh you know how this works because

2107.76 --> 2112.32
it wasn't official but people were using

2109.92 --> 2114.56
it i bet there were all kinds of secret

2112.32 --> 2116.56
radio communications

2114.56 --> 2117.839
and that nobody understood like how did

2116.56 --> 2119.599
you know that

2117.839 --> 2122.24
that person on the other side of the

2119.599 --> 2126.32
world wrote a letter and you knew it

2122.24 --> 2129.2799999999997
like the next day how is that possible

2126.32 --> 2132.079
news can't travel that fast

2129.28 --> 2134.88
well it secretly could because they did

2132.079 --> 2137.3590000000004
have radio they just it wasn't official

2134.88 --> 2139.119
they just used it secretly

2137.359 --> 2141.2799999999997
it's very handy when you want to

2139.119 --> 2144.28
conspire

2141.28 --> 2144.28
right

2145.2 --> 2150.359
1880 wow

2147.359 --> 2150.359
right

2169.68 --> 2173.9199999999996
marconi and tesla

2172.88 --> 2176.88
wait

2173.92 --> 2176.88
did they literally

2177.119 --> 2180.52
invent that

2195.2 --> 2198.2
mm-hmm

2201.359 --> 2206.88
right but isn't this always isn't it

2203.92 --> 2208.079
just standard policy oh there's a new

2206.88 --> 2210.7200000000003
invention

2208.079 --> 2212.8390000000004
oh [ __ ] this is like really good and

2210.72 --> 2216.16
really effective and really

2212.839 --> 2217.2799999999997
cheap yeah we can't allow that to become

2216.16 --> 2221.04
public

2217.28 --> 2224.6400000000003
we can't just give all that easy cheap

2221.04 --> 2226.16
technology to the public no no no no we

2224.64 --> 2229.68
quickly we gotta

2226.16 --> 2231.52
make a little story make a little story

2229.68 --> 2233.2
to bring in all these complications so

2231.52 --> 2235.44
it's like oh [ __ ] that's really

2233.2 --> 2236.8799999999997
expensive or oh [ __ ] that's really

2235.44 --> 2240.8
dangerous

2236.88 --> 2243.6800000000003
and then like that you can declassify it

2240.8 --> 2245.44
and make it into a public utility

2243.68 --> 2247.5989999999997
and then all the sheep they won't

2245.44 --> 2250.88
understand they won't know the better

2247.599 --> 2253.119
and they will accept oh well

2250.88 --> 2254.4
this new technology it requires a lot of

2253.119 --> 2256.32
money

2254.4 --> 2259.2000000000003
so yeah everybody will just pay that

2256.32 --> 2261.599
money then right that's how you enroll

2259.2 --> 2263.7599999999998
technology you make up a little [ __ ]

2261.599 --> 2266.96
story that is completely superfluous to

2263.76 --> 2270.32
the technology to create virtual extra

2266.96 --> 2272.96
expenses so you can exploit the public

2270.32 --> 2272.96
with that

2276.32 --> 2281.92
that's how that works

2278.88 --> 2283.92
with so many things it's mind-boggling

2281.92 --> 2285.839
right it's not just like satellites and

2283.92 --> 2287.44
radio no it's also

2285.839 --> 2288.64
nuclear power

2287.44 --> 2293.2000000000003
huh

2288.64 --> 2296.56
yeah super easy super safe super cheap

2293.2 --> 2298.3999999999996
that can't be allowed no it's dangerous

2296.56 --> 2300.64
it's dangerous

2298.4 --> 2302.8
if you have a nuclear power plant then

2300.64 --> 2305.44
you could make this

2302.8 --> 2308.32
world destroying stuff supposedly and

2305.44 --> 2310.7200000000003
it's so poisoned oh my god no

2308.32 --> 2313.52
no no you can't just have really cheap

2310.72 --> 2317.04
efficient environmentally friendly

2313.52 --> 2319.2
power that's just gonna last forever

2317.04 --> 2322.32
no no they gotta make up a little

2319.2 --> 2326.72
[ __ ] story first before it can

2322.32 --> 2328.4
become official for the public now don't

2326.72 --> 2330.0789999999997
they

2328.4 --> 2331.359
maybe you could

2330.079 --> 2332.8
some of you could

2331.359 --> 2333.68
even think of

2332.8 --> 2337.2000000000003
more

2333.68 --> 2340.64
of these types of scenarios

2337.2 --> 2344.0789999999997
oh technology oh so cool oh oh oh wait

2340.64 --> 2347.04
it was actually invented way before it

2344.079 --> 2349.119
officially was invented yeah

2347.04 --> 2350.96
yeah that seems to happen a lot doesn't

2349.119 --> 2352.6400000000003
it so

2350.96 --> 2356.32
what is it actually

2352.64 --> 2359.7599999999998
and when it was declassified what

2356.32 --> 2363.839
[ __ ] story did they add on top

2359.76 --> 2365.6800000000003
to heighten the costs or the risk factor

2363.839 --> 2368.96
yeah

2365.68 --> 2370.96
now there's a task now there's a task

2368.96 --> 2375.2400000000002
for anybody that actually wants to

2370.96 --> 2375.2400000000002
understand what the hell's going on

2380.28 --> 2383.4190000000003
[Music]

2386.0 --> 2388.8
yeah

2387.52 --> 2390.96
the first

2388.8 --> 2394.32
you said it wrong though the first

2390.96 --> 2397.04
official nuclear power plant

2394.32 --> 2398.4
went online in 1951 yeah

2397.04 --> 2401.04
official

2398.4 --> 2404.0
you really think they've never used

2401.04 --> 2407.4
steam turbines

2404.0 --> 2408.96
with nuclear material before

2407.4 --> 2411.599
1951

2408.96 --> 2414.4
really you really think they've never

2411.599 --> 2416.8
done that before

2414.4 --> 2416.8
wow

2421.92 --> 2426.079
the public has been against nuclear

2423.68 --> 2429.1189999999997
power for decades though yeah why why do

2426.079 --> 2431.52
you think because the added [ __ ]

2429.119 --> 2435.839
story oh it's so dangerous it's poisons

2431.52 --> 2437.52
oh look you can make it into this weapon

2435.839 --> 2439.2
it's so polluting

2437.52 --> 2443.92
yeah that's

2439.2 --> 2443.9199999999996
why the public is against it

2446.72 --> 2451.359
if it was fully declassified how

2448.8 --> 2453.599
incredibly safe and environmentally

2451.359 --> 2455.2799999999997
friendly and durable nuclear power

2453.599 --> 2457.04
really was

2455.28 --> 2458.96
people wouldn't

2457.04 --> 2461.119
respond like that at all

2458.96 --> 2463.68
if they knew that nuclear bombs are

2461.119 --> 2466.2400000000002
complete hogwash fakery

2463.68 --> 2468.0
doesn't actually happen then they

2466.24 --> 2471.45
wouldn't be as worried about nuclear

2468.0 --> 2474.489
power plants at all now would they

2471.45 --> 2474.489
[Music]

2477.599 --> 2481.76
ten years after the manhattan project

2479.599 --> 2485.119
[ __ ] that's right so they first had

2481.76 --> 2487.5200000000004
to make up big big boom nuke

2485.119 --> 2490.319
nuclear material oh dangerous poisonous

2487.52 --> 2493.119
boom fallout oh and then they can oh

2490.319 --> 2496.48
look now we can make it into a public

2493.119 --> 2498.319
official utility now yeah you really

2496.48 --> 2501.44
think they've never used any form of

2498.319 --> 2503.92
nuclear power before that

2501.44 --> 2505.28
what [ __ ]

2503.92 --> 2506.16
yeah

2505.28 --> 2509.8
dude

2506.16 --> 2511.68
they were using radium spheres in

2509.8 --> 2512.96
fireplaces

2511.68 --> 2515.839
okay

2512.96 --> 2517.119
it was a common utility

2515.839 --> 2519.44
in like

2517.119 --> 2521.119
the late 19th century

2519.44 --> 2523.52
like dude

2521.119 --> 2524.8
just freaking spheres they put them on

2523.52 --> 2526.96
cars

2524.8 --> 2532.0
they put them in fireplaces it was

2526.96 --> 2533.839
literally open nuclear material radium

2532.0 --> 2536.0
right it was right there it was a public

2533.839 --> 2540.0
utility

2536.0 --> 2542.0
oh no no we can't talk about that oh

2540.0 --> 2543.68
no that doesn't exist because that would

2542.0 --> 2546.4
be way too dangerous then everybody

2543.68 --> 2549.7599999999998
would have died yeah no they didn't

2546.4 --> 2550.96
no they didn't actually die

2549.76 --> 2553.119
because then

2550.96 --> 2554.4
if it turned out that is that poisonous

2553.119 --> 2556.56
and everybody would have died that it

2554.4 --> 2559.359
would have used that then they would

2556.56 --> 2562.319
have literally demolished

2559.359 --> 2564.0789999999997
it because it's like this is evil this

2562.319 --> 2565.7599999999998
kills everybody we gotta destroy it

2564.079 --> 2567.8390000000004
before it kills more people yeah they

2565.76 --> 2571.28
didn't do that

2567.839 --> 2574.24
they just confiscated the spheres

2571.28 --> 2575.599
for later projects

2574.24 --> 2577.839
huh

2575.599 --> 2580.56
everybody forget that that's possible oh

2577.839 --> 2584.0
yes and then oh manhattan project oh

2580.56 --> 2586.96
look we found out nuclear material

2584.0 --> 2586.96
canoeis so

2599.599 --> 2602.1600000000003
yep

2600.48 --> 2604.16
so yeah

2602.16 --> 2606.3999999999996
i really think that the manhunter

2604.16 --> 2608.3999999999996
project was all that revolutionary

2606.4 --> 2611.839
nuclear power plants oh what a

2608.4 --> 2615.52
revolution oh so special

2611.839 --> 2618.119
no it was not a revolution at all

2615.52 --> 2620.64
it was already a common household

2618.119 --> 2623.04
appliance for crying out loud in the

2620.64 --> 2624.96
late 19th century they just don't want

2623.04 --> 2627.96
you to know about it

2624.96 --> 2627.96
huh

2629.28 --> 2632.4590000000003
[Music]

2640.22 --> 2643.4199999999996
[Music]

2644.88 --> 2648.8
i don't get why you think we can't have

2646.88 --> 2650.88
vision

2648.8 --> 2652.7200000000003
uh because you can

2650.88 --> 2655.28
it just doesn't happen it's science

2652.72 --> 2657.5989999999997
fiction based on presuppositional

2655.28 --> 2660.7200000000003
molecular theory and it's complete

2657.599 --> 2663.04
[ __ ] it was never proven

2660.72 --> 2665.359
it comes out of the same ridiculous

2663.04 --> 2667.119
presuppositional

2665.359 --> 2669.2799999999997
hogwash corner

2667.119 --> 2671.6800000000003
as well everything else that einstein

2669.28 --> 2671.6800000000003
made up

2672.24 --> 2678.16
because i'm pretty sure that he was

2674.079 --> 2678.1600000000003
involved within the conception

2678.8 --> 2681.599
of the spell

2682.0 --> 2688.48
just like pseudo-romanian force base

2685.68 --> 2691.68
was very good at making a [ __ ]

2688.48 --> 2695.119
that people would be believing in or

2691.68 --> 2695.1189999999997
could be made to believe in

2700.8 --> 2705.44
because they're too exposed yeah because

2702.48 --> 2706.72
it doesn't i don't understand why you

2705.44 --> 2708.8
think that what

2706.72 --> 2710.0789999999997
just because i've been indoctrinated all

2708.8 --> 2713.119
my life

2710.079 --> 2715.44
everybody for over a century almost

2713.119 --> 2717.44
about how that supposedly happens i

2715.44 --> 2719.2000000000003
don't understand why you don't accept

2717.44 --> 2721.44
your conditioning yeah because i don't

2719.2 --> 2724.3999999999996
because i know it's [ __ ] it doesn't

2721.44 --> 2727.28
actually work nuclear bombs are fake

2724.4 --> 2727.28
they don't happen

2727.76 --> 2732.2400000000002
all the alleged demonstrations can all

2730.64 --> 2734.48
be

2732.24 --> 2737.4399999999996
reverse engineered

2734.48 --> 2740.72
and determinated through photoshop and

2737.44 --> 2742.88
other like forensic analysis to be

2740.72 --> 2744.56
fakeries

2742.88 --> 2746.48
professor fieldwell

2744.56 --> 2748.96
that's why

2746.48 --> 2751.2
doesn't reach critical mass uranium

2748.96 --> 2753.52
doesn't reach critical mass and explode

2751.2 --> 2755.5989999999997
it just doesn't happen

2753.52 --> 2761.839
ever

2755.599 --> 2761.839
it's just material it just radiates heat

2767.44 --> 2772.56
like personally i'm not even 100 sure

2770.319 --> 2775.119
about this alleged half-life situation

2772.56 --> 2777.04
that they talk about

2775.119 --> 2780.2400000000002
i have like

2777.04 --> 2780.24
how would you even

2780.72 --> 2785.2
be able to determine whether that is

2782.8 --> 2787.52
actually really true

2785.2 --> 2789.52
that it really does that the amount of

2787.52 --> 2791.359
time

2789.52 --> 2793.7599999999998
it takes

2791.359 --> 2796.0
i mean

2793.76 --> 2798.4
they didn't haven't had enough time to

2796.0 --> 2801.44
actually [ __ ] confirm their own

2798.4 --> 2805.599
half-life theory they don't even have it

2801.44 --> 2805.599
it's [ __ ] it's all nonsense

2807.44 --> 2812.4
how do you know that it actually changes

2810.319 --> 2814.24
into another material because of

2812.4 --> 2817.76
half-life you don't know that there

2814.24 --> 2819.16
hasn't been enough time past to even

2817.76 --> 2820.88
prove it

2819.16 --> 2824.0
ridiculous

2820.88 --> 2826.7200000000003
ridiculous how many [ __ ] stories are

2824.0 --> 2828.88
you just gonna swallow the whole

2826.72 --> 2831.839
without even seeing it's [ __ ] i

2828.88 --> 2831.839
can't believe it

2836.67 --> 2839.84
[Music]

2856.24 --> 2860.8799999999997
the radioactive uranium okay good for

2858.72 --> 2860.8799999999997
you

2861.92 --> 2865.52
you can actually just drink that

2867.839 --> 2875.119
i'm not joking it's been done

2871.2 --> 2875.1189999999997
person is still alive i think

2876.24 --> 2879.7999999999997
did it on camera

2892.24 --> 2897.24
you can measure it really

2901.2 --> 2905.2
oh

2902.4 --> 2908.8
you calculate an alleged loss of

2905.2 --> 2911.7599999999998
material and that means because there is

2908.8 --> 2914.96
an alleged loss of material that there

2911.76 --> 2916.7200000000003
is a half-life procedure really

2914.96 --> 2920.7200000000003
that's the proof

2916.72 --> 2923.4399999999996
or or maybe it just lost weight

2920.72 --> 2924.3999999999996
because there's some kind of material

2923.44 --> 2926.88
loss

2924.4 --> 2930.2400000000002
right it's radiating

2926.88 --> 2932.96
heat maybe it's kind of like slightly

2930.24 --> 2935.52
evaporating

2932.96 --> 2937.839
how do you know it is the same material

2935.52 --> 2942.24
that turn into something else in order

2937.839 --> 2944.72
to confirm this supposed half-life

2942.24 --> 2946.9599999999996
all you've measured is material loss how

2944.72 --> 2949.2
do you know it is because of this

2946.96 --> 2951.92
alleged process professor phil bell how

2949.2 --> 2951.9199999999996
do you know

2952.24 --> 2957.4399999999996
you don't

2954.64 --> 2959.52
i mean what the hell

2957.44 --> 2962.559
i'm gonna take all that material and

2959.52 --> 2965.2
analyze it molecular wise

2962.559 --> 2969.0400000000004
afterward and see like what percentage

2965.2 --> 2971.4399999999996
of what material is there like no

2969.04 --> 2973.7599999999998
you don't you don't do that it's too

2971.44 --> 2976.2400000000002
tedious you just calculate it and then

2973.76 --> 2977.2000000000003
you assume it's half-life even though

2976.24 --> 2979.839
hey

2977.2 --> 2981.5989999999997
you could have other material right

2979.839 --> 2983.7599999999998
i mean i could have like

2981.599 --> 2985.92
let's just say i have like a batch of

2983.76 --> 2987.44
iodine crystals right i just have it

2985.92 --> 2989.2000000000003
right there

2987.44 --> 2991.839
it's gonna lose weight

2989.2 --> 2992.64
is that because of half-life

2991.839 --> 2994.0
no

2992.64 --> 2998.2799999999997
no it's not

2994.0 --> 2998.28
it's because it evaporates

3003.29 --> 3006.34
[Music]

3014.0 --> 3017.0
ugh

3061.599 --> 3066.2400000000002
yes yes keep keep chanting for us

3064.24 --> 3068.4799999999996
professor phil will double down on your

3066.24 --> 3070.16
presuppositions that i just laid out how

3068.48 --> 3071.839
you're not actually proving that by

3070.16 --> 3074.319
calculating some

3071.839 --> 3078.319
some weight loss you dumbass

3074.319 --> 3081.2
keep presupposing the same [ __ ]

3078.319 --> 3083.2
that's gonna prove it just chant it

3081.2 --> 3085.839
now you made your argument how it is

3083.2 --> 3088.7999999999997
that by just repeating the same chant

3085.839 --> 3091.599
and not actually replying to the

3088.8 --> 3096.6800000000003
in-detail rebuttal

3091.599 --> 3096.6800000000003

3107.26 --> 3113.0400000000004
[Music]

3109.119 --> 3113.04
and yes of course it does

3116.57 --> 3122.48
[Music]

3119.2 --> 3127.2
then how many millennia does it take to

3122.48 --> 3127.2
do that johnson's fitzgerald

3128.4 --> 3133.839
that's already mixes or it's just

3130.4 --> 3136.559
another material that seems very close

3133.839 --> 3139.5589999999997
to radium and uranium

3136.559 --> 3139.559
huh

3140.4 --> 3148.88
one build oh my god he's actually doing

3143.839 --> 3150.88
this oh my god you [ __ ] dumbass

3148.88 --> 3153.599
aren't you listening to a word we're

3150.88 --> 3158.319
saying here

3153.599 --> 3160.8
we are it does happen it has to happen

3158.319 --> 3163.44
i mean it's takes only a million years

3160.8 --> 3166.319
but uranium turns into radium and that

3163.44 --> 3169.04
then turns into radon it only takes a

3166.319 --> 3172.64
million years but we know this is true

3169.04 --> 3175.92
because we demonstrate that it

3172.64 --> 3179.24
no no you haven't you presupposed it you

3175.92 --> 3179.2400000000002
dumb ass

3184.319 --> 3187.04
yes

3189.6 --> 3192.75
[Music]

3193.839 --> 3198.92
can't believe he's actually just saying

3195.92 --> 3198.92
that

3227.76 --> 3232.3190000000004
oh yeah by the way all these people the

3230.2 --> 3235.2
radioactivity and all that yeah you know

3232.319 --> 3238.24
why they died of leukemia

3235.2 --> 3241.4399999999996
because a lot of these materials are

3238.24 --> 3244.0
poisonous not radioactive

3241.44 --> 3245.359
poisonous yeah

3244.0 --> 3247.52
there's people

3245.359 --> 3250.24
that get leukemia

3247.52 --> 3251.44
not from radiation

3250.24 --> 3252.16
huh

3251.44 --> 3254.48
so

3252.16 --> 3256.8799999999997
you get it another way too

3254.48 --> 3257.92
so why would you assume

3256.88 --> 3260.4
that it's

3257.92 --> 3262.88
because of the radiation they work with

3260.4 --> 3264.079
the material all the time

3262.88 --> 3267.44
that means they're going to be

3264.079 --> 3269.6800000000003
physically exposed to the physical

3267.44 --> 3271.44
substance right i don't even think that

3269.68 --> 3273.7599999999998
the radiation is all that relevant

3271.44 --> 3276.079
although if you keep zapping a lot with

3273.76 --> 3278.0
like if you have

3276.079 --> 3279.3590000000004
like electrified or whatever they do

3278.0 --> 3280.799
with it

3279.359 --> 3283.44
i don't know

3280.799 --> 3286.559
yeah you you're gonna just get poison

3283.44 --> 3286.559
you're gonna get poison

3290.96 --> 3297.92
i mean uranium on average isn't all that

3293.76 --> 3299.76
poisonous but a lot of oh god

3297.92 --> 3303.96
not muted what are you talking about

3299.76 --> 3303.96
steamy traveler i'm not muted

3325.119 --> 3330.079
all right well i am gonna draw some

3327.28 --> 3332.88
conclusions about leukemia yeah it

3330.079 --> 3335.2000000000003
happens because of poisoning

3332.88 --> 3338.319
typically

3335.2 --> 3339.359
poisoning of the substance in your bones

3338.319 --> 3341.7599999999998
which

3339.359 --> 3344.319
creates the blood plates and all that

3341.76 --> 3346.8390000000004
and that's what leukemia is

3344.319 --> 3348.64
it's poisoning

3346.839 --> 3351.2799999999997
radiation

3348.64 --> 3352.96
poisoning

3351.28 --> 3355.92
yeah

3352.96 --> 3358.319
i mean you're not gonna get leukemia

3355.92 --> 3360.559
if you're a porcelain salesman and

3358.319 --> 3362.24
you're literally in a store constantly

3360.559 --> 3364.1600000000003
day in day out your entire life

3362.24 --> 3366.799
surrounded by porcelain you're not gonna

3364.16 --> 3368.24
die of leukemia

3366.799 --> 3370.0
yeah

3368.24 --> 3372.16
because i don't think you get that from

3370.0 --> 3373.839
radiation i think you get it from

3372.16 --> 3376.68
poisoning

3373.839 --> 3378.52
and maybe poisoning of materials

3376.68 --> 3380.319
associated with

3378.52 --> 3382.319
radioactivity

3380.319 --> 3385.04
because a lot of them are poisonous like

3382.319 --> 3387.52
for example plutonium is

3385.04 --> 3389.7599999999998
extremely poisonous

3387.52 --> 3392.0
and i think there's even worse forms of

3389.76 --> 3395.28
nuclear material

3392.0 --> 3395.28
that are just poisonous

3402.24 --> 3408.0
personally it doesn't matter

3404.72 --> 3408.0
my point remains

3408.88 --> 3414.7200000000003
if you have re if you're look if you're

3411.92 --> 3416.559
a radioactive porcelain salesman and

3414.72 --> 3418.799
you're surrounded by radioactive

3416.559 --> 3422.799
porcelain all day long your entire life

3418.799 --> 3422.799
you're not gonna die from leukemia

3424.16 --> 3431.1189999999997
unless the porcelain keeps breaking

3427.52 --> 3434.4
and you keep sniffing up the

3431.119 --> 3434.4
the nuclear dust

3434.64 --> 3438.0
right if they actually coat that with

3436.64 --> 3440.0789999999997
what you say with

3438.0 --> 3442.4
a uranium or something

3440.079 --> 3445.2000000000003
or if you're then going to keep like

3442.4 --> 3447.359
getting the dust of that inside of you

3445.2 --> 3448.96
yeah then you might get poisoned

3447.359 --> 3450.72
eventually

3448.96 --> 3455.48
just being in the presence of

3450.72 --> 3455.48
radioactivity doesn't do that

3479.68 --> 3482.96
right

3480.64 --> 3485.04
taking star wars hello by the way

3482.96 --> 3487.44
yeah if you're gonna mine uranium you're

3485.04 --> 3489.92
gonna get poison [ __ ]

3487.44 --> 3491.28
it's not just uranium by the way it's

3489.92 --> 3493.92
all kinds of

3491.28 --> 3497.119
material that when mined

3493.92 --> 3500.48
actually really toxic

3497.119 --> 3502.88
do mining coal can be extremely toxic

3500.48 --> 3504.319
depending on how polluted or how clean

3502.88 --> 3505.44
the coal is

3504.319 --> 3508.4
right

3505.44 --> 3509.839
it's the [ __ ] that's also kind of

3508.4 --> 3512.1600000000003
dissolved

3509.839 --> 3513.7599999999998
and in between it a lot of the time with

3512.16 --> 3514.839
the coal

3513.76 --> 3518.559
because yeah

3514.839 --> 3520.96
carbon is kind of like an absorbent of

3518.559 --> 3523.28
certain substances just like fat can be

3520.96 --> 3524.88
an absorbent of very specific fat

3523.28 --> 3526.2400000000002
soluble

3524.88 --> 3528.0
substances

3526.24 --> 3532.0789999999997
and if you're gonna mine that you're

3528.0 --> 3534.48
gonna have that stuff and the dust

3532.079 --> 3537.88
right that's the thing that poisons you

3534.48 --> 3537.88
not the radioactivity

3541.359 --> 3546.48
right you can get it in a textile

3543.2 --> 3546.48
factory too because of just

3547.839 --> 3552.4
yeah dust

3550.24 --> 3555.52
i mean it doesn't always even have to be

3552.4 --> 3556.839
radioactive it's just dust dust of

3555.52 --> 3560.16
poison

3556.839 --> 3562.64
[ __ ] body can't get rid of it toxic

3560.16 --> 3565.64
overload you get a disease and then you

3562.64 --> 3565.64
die

3574.4 --> 3580.44
here we go again with the [ __ ]

3577.44 --> 3580.44
no

3589.92 --> 3595.799
keep presupposing professor field bill

3592.24 --> 3595.799
keep doing that

3633.68 --> 3636.68
anyway

3658.48 --> 3662.4
yep wireless signals have been around

3660.079 --> 3665.8390000000004
since the 1900s and

3662.4 --> 3668.559
it is officially even admitted like

3665.839 --> 3671.04
radar stations

3668.559 --> 3673.52
you're working at a radar station it's

3671.04 --> 3675.359
very likely that at some point you're

3673.52 --> 3676.88
gonna die from cancer

3675.359 --> 3678.799
because you're getting an aggressive

3676.88 --> 3681.599
amount of energy

3678.799 --> 3685.28
pumped through you

3681.599 --> 3687.2000000000003
enough to like put your cup of coffee

3685.28 --> 3689.8390000000004
like right next to the radar just to

3687.2 --> 3689.839
heat it up

3696.48 --> 3700.48
yep and there's a good chance that it

3698.64 --> 3703.68
the spanish flu was

3700.48 --> 3705.599
in conjunction with radio unfolding

3703.68 --> 3707.44
well rather radar it's not even radio

3705.599 --> 3709.76
it's radar

3707.44 --> 3712.76
radar is much more strong than

3709.76 --> 3712.76
radio

3715.68 --> 3719.1189999999997
more

3716.559 --> 3722.2400000000002
invasive

3719.119 --> 3724.839
but also spanish flu was very likely

3722.24 --> 3726.4799999999996
also because of

3724.839 --> 3730.48
vaccines

3726.48 --> 3730.48
there were vaccine rollouts

3730.96 --> 3736.64
and then everybody get it so yeah radio

3733.76 --> 3738.4
is would have not helped for sure

3736.64 --> 3741.1189999999997
but seeking star wars i think that at

3738.4 --> 3742.799
the core of it it really was a vaccine

3741.119 --> 3746.76
rollout that actually caused the

3742.799 --> 3746.7599999999998
supposed spanish flu

3755.68 --> 3760.72
you could say that spanish flu might

3757.44 --> 3763.68
have been like the first coronu

3760.72 --> 3763.68
type scam

3764.24 --> 3772.0389999999998
that's been applied to that scale

3768.24 --> 3772.0389999999998
early 20th century

3786.96 --> 3791.039
i don't know where the signal brought

3788.48 --> 3793.039
about new signal well right well

3791.039 --> 3795.039
george sanford

3793.039 --> 3796.559
the thing is it doesn't make everybody

3795.039 --> 3799.5200000000004
sick

3796.559 --> 3801.76
it just makes some people sick

3799.52 --> 3804.16
that have like weaknesses

3801.76 --> 3805.6800000000003
that are have basically like sensory

3804.16 --> 3808.0
sensitivity

3805.68 --> 3811.69
and radio signals get in the way of

3808.0 --> 3814.8
their sensory ability right

3811.69 --> 3814.8
[Music]

3816.559 --> 3820.48
but it's not the same it's like not

3818.48 --> 3823.039
everybody would have gotten sick some

3820.48 --> 3824.64
people got sick and then they probably

3823.039 --> 3826.4
died because

3824.64 --> 3828.96
the

3826.4 --> 3831.2000000000003
the toxic influence that standard signal

3828.96 --> 3833.2
that's now going around wouldn't go away

3831.2 --> 3835.68
and then their body would be like okay

3833.2 --> 3837.68
that means i can't function anymore and

3835.68 --> 3839.44
then you're gonna die

3837.68 --> 3843.5989999999997
right but that would have been separate

3839.44 --> 3843.599
from the spanish flu scenario

3850.96 --> 3856.4
what argument

3853.96 --> 3858.64
conflagrationary when

3856.4 --> 3859.839
what does that mean

3858.64 --> 3862.319
thank you

3859.839 --> 3865.319
to do with conflate

3862.319 --> 3865.319
what

3898.0 --> 3901.76
all right yeah five routes well how is

3900.16 --> 3903.5989999999997
that different from

3901.76 --> 3906.7990000000004
getting a

3903.599 --> 3908.799
current day vaccine right

3906.799 --> 3912.319
i mean people that have done that are

3908.799 --> 3915.0389999999998
going out in horrifying ways it's been

3912.319 --> 3918.4
on camera even

3915.039 --> 3920.48
they go out in horrifying ways yeah

3918.4 --> 3923.119
well the spanish flu was exactly like

3920.48 --> 3925.599
that it's oh my god do something really

3923.119 --> 3927.76
dangerous quickly take the vaccine oh

3925.599 --> 3930.0
look see it's happening

3927.76 --> 3931.44
after people have taken the vaccine the

3930.0 --> 3932.64
ones that took it

3931.44 --> 3936.839
oh no

3932.64 --> 3936.839
how could we have foreseen this

3937.28 --> 3943.039
yeah exactly like the predicament we're

3940.559 --> 3946.6400000000003
all in right now

3943.039 --> 3946.6400000000003
2020 2022

3948.0 --> 3952.319
except

3949.2 --> 3954.0
like in current day they didn't even say

3952.319 --> 3956.16
it was all this dangerous they just say

3954.0 --> 3958.799
no you just got to get it oh oh yeah the

3956.16 --> 3961.359
actual disease is like

3958.799 --> 3963.44
the the least risky disease that has

3961.359 --> 3965.839
ever been recorded in human history

3963.44 --> 3968.16
right remember how [ __ ] that was

3965.839 --> 3970.16
like they didn't even claim it was

3968.16 --> 3971.68
actually dangerous

3970.16 --> 3974.48
in the stats

3971.68 --> 3974.48
it's just no

3974.559 --> 3978.559
back then they did they did say this is

3977.119 --> 3980.319
super dangerous

3978.559 --> 3982.3190000000004
you gotta take this or

3980.319 --> 3987.359
you could die horribly like did there

3982.319 --> 3987.359
was no claim of that there was no claim

3987.44 --> 3991.44
in current day

3989.039 --> 3993.92
like that no they just say no you just

3991.44 --> 3997.44
got to take it just do what we say just

3993.92 --> 4001.16
do what we say just do what we say

3997.44 --> 4001.16
it's more about that

4010.88 --> 4014.11
[Music]

4016.559 --> 4021.92
come on hill to the shaft don't do that

4020.0 --> 4023.359
i'll respond to that just

4021.92 --> 4025.44
just ask me

4023.359 --> 4027.2
yeah

4025.44 --> 4029.44
she said was right

4027.2 --> 4031.68
radio waves coincides with the spanish

4029.44 --> 4035.68
flu they were rolled out in the same

4031.68 --> 4038.0
time frame like in the same year

4035.68 --> 4041.1189999999997
arguably like in this exact same moment

4038.0 --> 4044.72
they simultaneously rolled it out

4041.119 --> 4047.52
they did a vaccine event spanish flew

4044.72 --> 4049.359
and they turned on the radio and the

4047.52 --> 4051.0389999999998
radar

4049.359 --> 4053.839
and they knew

4051.039 --> 4057.119
people were gonna get sick and die of it

4053.839 --> 4059.599
and that's probably why they rolled out

4057.119 --> 4063.839
a vaccine event that turned into the

4059.599 --> 4066.799
spanish flu to cover for the damage of

4063.839 --> 4069.68
the technological rollout of radar and

4066.799 --> 4073.52
radio because they didn't want people to

4069.68 --> 4075.2
be scared of it it was the new hot thing

4073.52 --> 4077.92
it was going to lead to the media

4075.2 --> 4080.72
revolution and it has

4077.92 --> 4082.799
they didn't want people to realize that

4080.72 --> 4085.2
the second they turn it on people were

4082.799 --> 4087.359
gonna die horribly

4085.2 --> 4090.3999999999996
like feel like their soul suddenly got

4087.359 --> 4093.2
blocked and then they get sick and die

4090.4 --> 4095.599
it's a horrible horrible way to go by

4093.2 --> 4095.5989999999997
the way

4096.0 --> 4100.88
because like

4098.799 --> 4103.04
you're not even

4100.88 --> 4105.04
like attacked it's just you're sitting

4103.04 --> 4107.92
there and suddenly the entire world

4105.04 --> 4108.719
changes for you it's horrifying

4107.92 --> 4111.279
right

4108.719 --> 4115.359
they didn't want people to have that

4111.279 --> 4117.6
sink in as the price of using radio and

4115.359 --> 4118.719
radar they didn't want people to know

4117.6 --> 4121.120000000001
that

4118.719 --> 4123.279
so they'd roll out simultaneously

4121.12 --> 4126.239
because they knew it was going to happen

4123.279 --> 4129.279
they rolled out a vaccine event of an

4126.239 --> 4131.678999999999
alleged disease and everybody got

4129.279 --> 4133.759
that took that shot they got the disease

4131.679 --> 4135.6
and then that was much more distracting

4133.759 --> 4138.08
much

4135.6 --> 4138.88
then people just

4138.08 --> 4141.04
uh

4138.88 --> 4142.719
i don't want to live anymore and then

4141.04 --> 4144.4
just die

4142.719 --> 4147.52
right it's more dramatic it's more in

4144.4 --> 4148.639999999999
your face so that the actual radio

4147.52 --> 4153.359
victims

4148.64 --> 4153.359
could just more easily be forgotten

4153.52 --> 4157.319
that's why that happened

4161.92 --> 4168.56
radio i'm talking about radar primarily

4164.96 --> 4171.92
radar hell to the chef radar radar

4168.56 --> 4175.839000000001
systems lidar radar

4171.92 --> 4180.759
lidar rod the rock the lidar system

4175.839 --> 4180.759
yeah it's about lidar system

4188.4 --> 4191.759
i think it was called lighter

4199.36 --> 4207.398999999999
keyboard is having issues

4201.54 --> 4207.399
[Music]

4209.28 --> 4213.44
damn it

4210.48 --> 4215.759999999999
hell there's this one station

4213.44 --> 4217.678999999999
what's it called again can does anybody

4215.76 --> 4219.76
remember i thought it was the lidar

4217.679 --> 4223.36
station it might be wrong now lighters

4219.76 --> 4224.400000000001
another rear blah blah blah this is one

4223.36 --> 4226.08
station

4224.4 --> 4228.159
this one thing

4226.08 --> 4231.12
like on an island somewhere they had

4228.159 --> 4233.12
this massive radar complex

4231.12 --> 4235.12
that would go all around the world that

4233.12 --> 4237.599999999999
was also being used for radio

4235.12 --> 4240.159
communication they rolled it out that

4237.6 --> 4242.2390000000005
was the thing that was the system that

4240.159 --> 4245.28
did that damage

4242.239 --> 4248.5599999999995
very specific one piece of tech

4245.28 --> 4250.48
that was installed and initiated that

4248.56 --> 4253.360000000001
did the damage

4250.48 --> 4256.32
that did the actual radio damage

4253.36 --> 4258.48
worldwide a lot of people died very

4256.32 --> 4260.32
miserably because of that

4258.48 --> 4263.199
and then they rolled out the vaccine

4260.32 --> 4265.599999999999
event with the supposed spanish flu to

4263.199 --> 4270.599999999999
cover up for that

4265.6 --> 4270.6
am i specific enough for you now

4275.33 --> 4278.54
[Music]

4301.53 --> 4306.4

listen to what i'm [ __ ] telling you

4312.88 --> 4317.52
yeah

4313.76 --> 4321.719
it doesn't have a direct

4317.52 --> 4321.719
causal relation

4321.84 --> 4325.4400000000005
do you hear me

4323.28 --> 4327.5199999999995
radar did not

4325.44 --> 4331.759999999999
cause

4327.52 --> 4333.679
not cause the spanish flu so no of

4331.76 --> 4336.8
course you're not gonna see oh there

4333.679 --> 4339.36
wasn't a raider yet spanish yeah duh

4336.8 --> 4342.56
it didn't cause it

4339.36 --> 4346.48
spanish flu was rolled out

4342.56 --> 4348.320000000001
vaccine event to cover

4346.48 --> 4349.759999999999
cover

4348.32 --> 4352.799999999999
mask

4349.76 --> 4355.12
another thing the radar event it didn't

4352.8 --> 4358.64
cause it all right

4355.12 --> 4358.64
is it is it coming through now

4359.679 --> 4363.4400000000005

4705.36 --> 4711.4

4708.159 --> 4711.4

4735.28 --> 4738.8
like yeah you didn't have a hernia at

4737.199 --> 4742.0
nine year olds that

4738.8 --> 4743.679
would be really weird if you did

4742.0 --> 4747.64
like what i don't understand what you're

4743.679 --> 4747.64
saying now i said what

4748.159 --> 4753.04
have i had any significant injuries well

4750.32 --> 4754.719
nothing too extreme but yeah stevie

4753.04 --> 4757.36
traveler

4754.719 --> 4760.4800000000005
i broke my elbow as a kid in a really

4757.36 --> 4763.199
silly way when i was like six

4760.48 --> 4766.718999999999
and i've got plenty of cuts and scars

4763.199 --> 4766.719
from them like this one

4767.84 --> 4775.0
i've basically bashed through a whole

4769.84 --> 4775.0
bunch of glass doors and [ __ ] as a kid

4778.159 --> 4780.879999999999
yeah you couldn't really see that could

4779.92 --> 4784.32
you

4780.88 --> 4787.12
anyway i got a scar right here

4784.32 --> 4789.199
and i got one on my knee

4787.12 --> 4793.84
so yeah i am kind of scared but i've

4789.199 --> 4796.879999999999
never had like a a very serious accident

4793.84 --> 4796.88
like that never

4797.12 --> 4800.96
so it's just like cuts bruises

4801.6 --> 4806.320000000001
but then again i have been like very

4804.239 --> 4808.959999999999
paranoid and careful

4806.32 --> 4810.799999999999
a lot of the time post bashing through

4808.96 --> 4813.04
glass door phase

4810.8 --> 4815.679
that all happened like in my

4813.04 --> 4817.12
preteens

4815.679 --> 4821.12
it was very

4817.12 --> 4823.44
wild as a kid just like ah i'm gonna run

4821.12 --> 4825.36
i'm gonna run and bash open that door

4823.44 --> 4827.759999999999
and just keep doing that and not

4825.36 --> 4830.32
realizing like yeah but you're literally

4827.76 --> 4832.08
trying to bash open a glass door this is

4830.32 --> 4834.0
ridiculous

4832.08 --> 4836.159
of course i realized that afterwards

4834.0 --> 4837.36
like what the hell was i thinking

4836.159 --> 4840.638999999999
but

4837.36 --> 4843.44
yeah that kind of happened back then

4840.639 --> 4843.4400000000005
very wild

4844.32 --> 4848.32
but after that no i've never had like

4846.96 --> 4850.4
since

4848.32 --> 4852.48
i turned 10 pretty much i've never had a

4850.4 --> 4855.12
serious accident after

4852.48 --> 4855.12
ever again

4858.719 --> 4862.96
oh yeah i also remember jumping on a

4861.44 --> 4865.678999999999
stone wall

4862.96 --> 4867.6
at like a swimming park really stupid

4865.679 --> 4870.56
and then landed on my chin i still have

4867.6 --> 4870.56
the scar from that

4870.8 --> 4875.1990000000005
so those types of shitty things but

4873.12 --> 4877.44
nothing that was like extremely serious

4875.199 --> 4877.44
so

4879.36 --> 4883.639
i didn't have some stitches there

4891.84 --> 4897.04
right yeah professor phil well take care

4893.92 --> 4897.04

4897.6 --> 4902.400000000001

4902.4 --> 4905.839999999999
have like decent conversations and

4904.239 --> 4908.0
you're not like

4905.84 --> 4909.360000000001

4908.0 --> 4912.08

i mean every time they do it it's always

5030.56 --> 5034.8
a disaster i don't understand why this

5032.88 --> 5037.04
can continue even

5034.8 --> 5037.04
like

5039.76 --> 5045.6
i mean there's so much corruption in the

5042.639 --> 5047.76
u.s government in every sector so bad

5045.6 --> 5049.92
like the best thing you could ever hope

5047.76 --> 5051.6
for is that they just don't have any

5049.92 --> 5054.639
bills ever

5051.6 --> 5058.320000000001

5077.6 --> 5080.92
things worse

5085.04 --> 5087.36
all right

5094.56 --> 5099.4800000000005

5685.679 --> 5690.08
conversation

5687.119 --> 5694.08
but yeah that happens when really really

5690.08 --> 5697.5199999999995
disgusting scummy open satanists

5694.08 --> 5700.8
satan apologizers start meddling

5697.52 --> 5703.4400000000005
with my show

5700.8 --> 5704.96
i hate them

5703.44 --> 5708.96

5710.239 --> 5715.599999999999

5712.719 --> 5718.0

5718.0 --> 5720.96
of it i know when it's you you

5719.52 --> 5724.76
[ __ ]

5720.96 --> 5724.76

5810.96 --> 5814.32
with people that have wrenches

5822.32 --> 5827.239
oh yeah by the way elise g i'll take

5824.0 --> 5827.239
care of

5829.119 --> 5832.639
after moderating let's not overlap each

5831.84 --> 5835.28
other

5832.639 --> 5838.52
by accident

5835.28 --> 5838.5199999999995
but thanks

5860.5 --> 5864.89
[Music]

5865.04 --> 5868.04
uh

5875.58 --> 5878.8189999999995
[Music]

5894.4 --> 5900.48
how do dutch people pronounce krasong

5898.32 --> 5903.5199999999995
well they pronounce it french so they

5900.48 --> 5903.5199999999995
say krasong

5906.08 --> 5910.84
that's how we pronounce that just casa

5934.7 --> 5945.188999999999
[Music]

5951.84 --> 5953.92
you

5976.22 --> 5980.12
[Music]

5978.96 --> 5982.159
um

5980.12 --> 5985.28
[Music]

5982.159 --> 5985.28
i really needed that

5990.0 --> 5995.52
yeah at frays i guess

5992.639 --> 5998.56
that some like

5995.52 --> 6000.400000000001
dutch people say that

5998.56 --> 6003.04
but you're actually

6000.4 --> 6003.92
in dutch supposed to say it the french

6003.04 --> 6008.04
way

6003.92 --> 6008.04
that's where the word comes from

6012.08 --> 6018.8
but yes some people are not very good

6015.36 --> 6018.799999999999
linguistically and they say

6019.679 --> 6022.92
it's true

6025.36 --> 6028.46
[Music]

6035.47 --> 6044.54
[Music]

6042.56 --> 6049.64
um

6044.54 --> 6049.64
[Music]

6067.61 --> 6070.67
[Music]

6084.32 --> 6089.199
yeah i wouldn't be too eager about wi-fi

6086.56 --> 6092.639
extension either

6089.199 --> 6095.839999999999
right lay a cable

6092.639 --> 6095.84
that's a much better option

6101.52 --> 6105.92
i mean if you're going to be over in the

6103.36 --> 6107.36
shed a lot and you want con connection

6105.92 --> 6110.08
there then just

6107.36 --> 6110.08
lay a cable

6111.04 --> 6116.159
right you don't have to turn anything

6112.96 --> 6117.6
off or on constantly oh like because

6116.159 --> 6120.239
otherwise you're probably going to just

6117.6 --> 6121.76
end up having your wi-fi extender turned

6120.239 --> 6124.239
on all the time

6121.76 --> 6126.639
giving you the extra wi-fi ballast on

6124.239 --> 6130.08
your body

6126.639 --> 6134.84
but if you lay that cable just one time

6130.08 --> 6134.84
then you'll never have an issue again

6136.159 --> 6141.5199999999995
unless it breaks somehow but that's

6139.04 --> 6141.5199999999995
doubtful

6147.52 --> 6151.4400000000005
man i can't believe

6150.0 --> 6155.119
almost

6151.44 --> 6155.119
two hours have already passed

6155.28 --> 6158.95
it's been an intense show

6157.52 --> 6165.05
again

6158.95 --> 6165.05
[Music]

6190.32 --> 6195.84
hmm

6192.56 --> 6198.2390000000005
through the mains what does that mean

6195.84 --> 6200.8
is that like electric socket

6198.239 --> 6202.48
that's how i do it i got like a

6200.8 --> 6205.6
intellilink

6202.48 --> 6208.32
connection through the electric net and

6205.6 --> 6209.92
works great except when it does and then

6208.32 --> 6211.759999999999
kind of constantly interrupts it's

6209.92 --> 6214.0
annoying but it doesn't happen on a

6211.76 --> 6215.6
daily basis or anything

6214.0 --> 6217.36
right hell to the chef yeah i do that

6215.6 --> 6221.96
too

6217.36 --> 6221.96
it's amazingly reliable really

6243.04 --> 6249.92
were you on a peaceful no no i want

6247.679 --> 6252.4800000000005
are we knuckle wumble no

6249.92 --> 6255.04
i mean i sometimes like to forward

6252.48 --> 6257.678999999999
videos concerning farmer protests here

6255.04 --> 6260.96
in the netherlands on my twitter

6257.679 --> 6262.159
right i repost retweet them

6260.96 --> 6264.88
i

6262.159 --> 6268.96
dude i don't even get out of my own city

6264.88 --> 6270.32
here okay i haven't for a long ass time

6268.96 --> 6273.28
so

6270.32 --> 6275.759999999999
no i don't typically go to protests i

6273.28 --> 6277.28
sympathize a lot though

6275.76 --> 6279.76
on the other hand like what the [ __ ]

6277.28 --> 6282.5599999999995
would i be doing at a protest i'd just

6279.76 --> 6284.639
be kind of like this and be like really

6282.56 --> 6286.88
[ __ ] agitated that that shit's going

6284.639 --> 6286.88
on

6287.44 --> 6292.4
and i might just be not very convenient

6290.159 --> 6294.879999999999
because maybe i am just going to start a

6292.4 --> 6297.04
fight with some of these [ __ ] romeo

6294.88 --> 6298.719
pieces of [ __ ] and then literally bash

6297.04 --> 6301.28
their head in

6298.719 --> 6303.6
i don't know if i would be able to stop

6301.28 --> 6306.08
myself so maybe it's better that i don't

6303.6 --> 6308.320000000001
go to peaceful protest because i don't

6306.08 --> 6310.8
want peaceful protest i want to bash

6308.32 --> 6313.119
their [ __ ] heads in that's what i

6310.8 --> 6317.84
want i'm sick of this [ __ ]

6313.119 --> 6317.839999999999
i'm sick of it all i want them to pay

6320.159 --> 6326.96
as far as i'm concerned any [ __ ] cop

6323.6 --> 6329.679
that's even gonna like resist

6326.96 --> 6333.04
grassroots uprising

6329.679 --> 6335.04
to go after politicians they're in bed

6333.04 --> 6337.28
with them

6335.04 --> 6339.28
i don't care if they might be a really

6337.28 --> 6342.719
nice person underneath that

6339.28 --> 6346.4
you're on the side of satanic witches

6342.719 --> 6346.4
you deserve their faith then

6347.04 --> 6352.239
i'm done with it i'm done with it all i

6349.76 --> 6354.4800000000005
am really done with it

6352.239 --> 6356.638999999999
i'm ready for the end i'm ready to

6354.48 --> 6359.28
finish him off

6356.639 --> 6361.28
and i hope the rest of the world is not

6359.28 --> 6364.0
going to take too long to get to that

6361.28 --> 6364.0
point too

6370.88 --> 6375.84
but maybe it's a good idea in a way not

6373.92 --> 6378.88
to even get involved with the freaking

6375.84 --> 6380.4800000000005
protest but to be a little group on the

6378.88 --> 6381.84
side

6380.48 --> 6384.4
yeah

6381.84 --> 6387.360000000001
oh oh they can have their little

6384.4 --> 6390.638999999999
infiltration in their swastika flags oh

6387.36 --> 6393.199
it's the farmers the swastika farmers

6390.639 --> 6395.6
well maybe the grilling group of people

6393.199 --> 6397.44
yeah it's nothing to do with the protest

6395.6 --> 6399.6
it could just like

6397.44 --> 6401.28
maybe look around for those [ __ ]

6399.6 --> 6405.6
scumbags

6401.28 --> 6409.199
get them red handed and then bash their

6405.6 --> 6410.56
[ __ ] faces in

6409.199 --> 6411.919999999999
hmm

6410.56 --> 6413.52
how about that

6411.92 --> 6415.1990000000005
let's see if they're gonna keep doing it

6413.52 --> 6415.92
then huh

6415.199 --> 6418.879999999999
if

6415.92 --> 6421.76
not protester related groups

6418.88 --> 6423.119
bash these [ __ ] pieces of [ __ ] their

6421.76 --> 6426.719
faces in

6423.119 --> 6429.839999999999
yeah to actually like a gang

6426.719 --> 6431.679
beat them up

6429.84 --> 6432.639
let's see how they fare in the [ __ ]

6431.679 --> 6436.119
hospital

6432.639 --> 6436.119
[ __ ] scumbags

6442.08 --> 6446.48
uh you're ready to get this started too

6443.92 --> 6448.8
five roads

6446.48 --> 6450.959999999999
oh you may think you're ready for it it

6448.8 --> 6454.2390000000005
may feel ready but when it's gonna

6450.96 --> 6456.8
happen nobody's really gonna be ready

6454.239 --> 6459.919999999999
but it's gonna be ready or not here i

6456.8 --> 6459.92
come situation

6462.0 --> 6465.199
it's gonna happen whether you're ready

6463.92 --> 6466.96
or not

6465.199 --> 6468.879999999999
just make sure you're not on the wrong

6466.96 --> 6471.84
side when it does because then you're

6468.88 --> 6471.84
probably gonna die

6473.28 --> 6478.36
or at least not get out of it well

6495.04 --> 6500.239
and besides there is a lot of issues

6498.159 --> 6502.48
here in the netherlands there's so much

6500.239 --> 6506.239
corruption and it's the corruption is so

6502.48 --> 6507.28
deep it is satanic level corruption they

6506.239 --> 6510.32
are

6507.28 --> 6513.28
like child murdering monsters

6510.32 --> 6514.799999999999
they are they are doing that

6513.28 --> 6516.48
they're in the courts

6514.8 --> 6518.2390000000005
they're in the government they're in

6516.48 --> 6522.4
media

6518.239 --> 6523.839999999999
literal satanic child murderers

6522.4 --> 6526.4
they're in there

6523.84 --> 6528.88
i posted a link yesterday in the comment

6526.4 --> 6531.92
section of my own video

6528.88 --> 6533.1990000000005
that literally is about that here in the

6531.92 --> 6535.04
netherlands

6533.199 --> 6536.159
i could only watch half of it because

6535.04 --> 6538.48
after that

6536.159 --> 6541.28
i literally literally became

6538.48 --> 6544.159
physically ill

6541.28 --> 6546.96
it's so [ __ ] it's so [ __ ] and they

6544.159 --> 6548.879999999999
have to burn the people have to burn

6546.96 --> 6551.36
they have to die

6548.88 --> 6552.84
these [ __ ] child murderers have

6551.36 --> 6556.08
to die

6552.84 --> 6558.719
horrifically burn them

6556.08 --> 6558.719
burn them

6559.119 --> 6565.4

6585.84 --> 6589.92
people still don't see you but they

6587.28 --> 6593.759999999999
can't see it they can't handle that i

6589.92 --> 6596.4
can't handle it even now as i am

6593.76 --> 6598.4800000000005
putting myself down to specifically

6596.4 --> 6599.36
counter it even now

6598.48 --> 6601.759999999999
i

6599.36 --> 6603.28
can't handle it

6601.76 --> 6606.8
okay

6603.28 --> 6609.679
why would you expect the common dumbass

6606.8 --> 6611.84
go along to get along cattle dumbass to

6609.679 --> 6615.1990000000005
be able to handle or even accept that

6611.84 --> 6617.92
that exists they can't

6615.199 --> 6619.5199999999995
you shouldn't expect them to be able to

6617.92 --> 6622.639
handle that

6619.52 --> 6625.679
cementally does it mean that we can just

6622.639 --> 6627.84
let it all go

6625.679 --> 6629.84
we do that then they win and they make

6627.84 --> 6632.400000000001
everything worse for us

6629.84 --> 6637.04
and we're going to get more hell

6632.4 --> 6639.5199999999995
