69.25 --> 80.25
appreciated so yeah today the weather's

73.54 --> 80.25
the dreary it's like this constant

80.43 --> 91.619
drippy rain and yeah it's not all that

86.979 --> 96.28
great outside but it is what it is

91.619 --> 98.64
expect it to be like that all day it's

96.28 --> 102.07000000000001
kind of interesting in retrospect that I

98.64 --> 104.8
had these couple of clear days including

102.07 --> 106.80999999999999
frost on the rooftop then they suddenly

104.8 --> 110.259
started camp trailing again yesterday

106.81 --> 116.59
and now it's all rainy and dreary so

110.259 --> 118.899
yeah maybe just a correlation wow

116.59 --> 121.03
there's all these videos going on

118.899 --> 124.539
everywhere it's crazy

121.03 --> 129.22
Nathan's premiering something Totec with

124.539 --> 134.44
Brenda mm-hmm and Riley still doing his

129.22 --> 137.98
live show it was great I was on there

134.44 --> 141.37
for for a bit I'd love to have him on my

137.98 --> 144.63
show too if he'd come back even though

141.37 --> 147.66
my sound is not as good as his since he

144.63 --> 152.19
does have the use of audio banana

147.66 --> 153.67
but anyway shout out to sleeping warrior

152.19 --> 156.78
subscribed to him

153.67 --> 156.78
[Music]

157.29 --> 164.67999999999998
if you haven't already done that it's

160.689 --> 169.329
over here he still live over there I'm

164.68 --> 177.84900000000002
watching him now but yeah his hangout is

169.329 --> 180.12900000000002
great and I love what he's doing and in

177.849 --> 181.959
a way I wish I had some base material to

180.129 --> 183.76
work with like this but it's just not

181.959 --> 187.15
really my style to be constantly

183.76 --> 192.25
presenting stuff more of a describer I

187.15 --> 197.62
guess anyway it was interesting and yeah

192.25 --> 207.639
I got Tamera coffee with me tea that's

197.62 --> 213.519
it let's see who is in chat yeah

207.639 --> 218.769
hey GM was first Amanda young trigger

213.519 --> 221.079
troll Tom Parker who asked for a wrench

218.769 --> 227.639
and yeah I got a timeout that's what

221.079 --> 234.31
happens or any Astellas Thao Asteria

227.639 --> 235.989
yeah I wasn't too happy yesterday but

234.31 --> 238.299
that was because of personal

235.989 --> 238.69
circumstances and I explained some about

238.299 --> 240.72
it

238.69 --> 244.75
dreams not feeling all that great

240.72 --> 247.959
illusion trying to put itself to it

244.75 --> 251.34
convinced itself upon me again it's not

247.959 --> 261.13
a pleasant thing when it happens very

251.34 --> 265.06
unnerving right but I feel a lot better

261.13 --> 267.639
today I'm still it's my stomach like I

265.06 --> 272.37
don't know my stomach is very sensitive

267.639 --> 272.37
for some reason I don't get it

272.97 --> 281.28900000000004
Rambo Jambo is there over McCool drunken

278.259 --> 286.389
bullet for one one yeah you got a

281.289 --> 289.0
timeout over it at Riley's cuz yeah you

286.389 --> 291.659
can get a little while and just know

289.0 --> 291.659
you're that well

298.61 --> 309.59000000000003
I addressed that Tom Parker why why

305.51 --> 315.86
don't you just listen if you look in

309.59 --> 322.47999999999996
description box the video see marked

315.86 --> 325.07
live chat rules right new second rule

322.48 --> 331.22
newcomers may not ask for a wrench

325.07 --> 335.65999999999997
penalty of being banned so yeah be glad

331.22 --> 338.66
that I just timed you out because yeah

335.66 --> 340.49
because I want it to be nice for a

338.66 --> 345.79
change but you don't ask for a wrench

340.49 --> 345.79
it's extremely annoying don't push it

351.94 --> 362.05
how is it you are live right now on at

357.25 --> 365.32
different forums what do you mean what

362.05 --> 372.31
forums are you talking about modern

365.32 --> 378.21999999999997
cavemen no I'm not a vegan I'm a

372.31 --> 381.01
vegetarian also I am my own doctor and I

378.22 --> 387.0
tried to make my own lifestyle based on

381.01 --> 390.25
my own knowledge and how flexible I am

387.0 --> 396.37
trying to just be responsible into the

390.25 --> 401.14
future and handling myself and my ups

396.37 --> 403.27
and downs and where do I go so being a

401.14 --> 405.61
vegan I don't think any doctor any

403.27 --> 408.88
doctor would really recommend being a

405.61 --> 412.90000000000003
vegan unless they were well a specific

408.88 --> 418.0
vegan doctor whatever because yeah vegan

412.9 --> 420.28
being vegan is not easy it's not easy on

418.0 --> 425.14
on the body and there's a lot of

420.28 --> 431.04999999999995
pitfalls out there dangerous foods that

425.14 --> 434.5
you'll be goaded into taking just to get

431.05 --> 437.46000000000004
that alternative like they there is a

434.5 --> 440.77
thing going on in veganism is well-known

437.46 --> 443.38
just a fanatical nosov not eating meat

440.77 --> 446.78999999999996
and not any problem like the avoidance

443.38 --> 450.1
is fanatical for some people and that

446.79 --> 454.02000000000004
then forces you practically as you go

450.1 --> 456.91
about life and it forces you to take

454.02 --> 464.13
potentially more dangerous choices

456.91 --> 467.47900000000004
because they are not non vegan that's my

464.13 --> 471.33
view on that

467.479 --> 473.90999999999997
but you can live vegan it's just very

471.33 --> 476.69899999999996
difficult and not I don't think that

473.91 --> 478.8
everybody could be as good at it it

476.699 --> 482.0
really depends on your build on your

478.8 --> 487.169
metabolism on your origins on your roots

482.0 --> 492.65
some regional groups let's just say it

487.169 --> 497.19
like that tend to be better suited for

492.65 --> 500.34
for eating vegan and then for some

497.19 --> 504.419
reason in those same regions there are

500.34 --> 506.63899999999995
like typical spices that actually helped

504.419 --> 508.979
a lot in eating vegan so it's kind of

506.639 --> 512.64
weird how that works out but that

508.979 --> 515.43
doesn't mean that just anyone will be

512.64 --> 518.43
able to do it just as easily that's not

515.43 --> 520.77
how it works different builds and

518.43 --> 523.8199999999999
ordered regional origins influences

520.77 --> 526.35
cause different needs for the body and

523.82 --> 530.4300000000001
some of those needs are not so easily

526.35 --> 532.58
replaced vegan vegan wise it's just the

530.43 --> 532.5799999999999
reality

540.2 --> 549.8900000000001
anyway yeah just a bit about veganism

543.9 --> 555.54
because somebody brought it up huh see I

549.89 --> 559.26
did get everyone in chat I think yeah do

555.54 --> 565.4399999999999
I not go to the doctor no I don't go to

559.26 --> 569.79
the doctor under no circumstance unless

565.44 --> 575.46
well unless I had a serious type of

569.79 --> 577.5899999999999
wound you know yeah did well I probably

575.46 --> 580.47
just go straight to the hospital when

577.59 --> 587.1600000000001
that happens no not gonna be my own

580.47 --> 590.25
freakin surgeon but yeah other than that

587.16 --> 593.79
and that's doesn't happen I'm very

590.25 --> 595.59
careful with my physical incidents I was

593.79 --> 599.16
very reckless when I was young but I'm

595.59 --> 602.21
grown to be extremely careful in not

599.16 --> 607.3199999999999
getting damaged and even in making sure

602.21 --> 611.5500000000001
my stuff doesn't get damaged so very

607.32 --> 613.6500000000001
low-risk and yeah scratches and things I

611.55 --> 616.8599999999999
can absolutely take care of that and I

613.65 --> 619.98
am kind of aware of potential infection

616.86 --> 622.74
risks and all that because yeah whether

619.98 --> 625.89
I consider that to be any literal

622.74 --> 628.6800000000001
evasion of bacteria that are like or

625.89 --> 633.9
attacking or in some other way I just

628.68 --> 636.3599999999999
know the circumstances what will come

633.9 --> 639.18
forth from it from reflecting it upon

636.36 --> 640.95
wider experience including from other

639.18 --> 643.8599999999999
people just lending wisdom from other

640.95 --> 647.2800000000001
people so it's just practical these

643.86 --> 649.47
circumstances that can risk that that's

647.28 --> 653.91
it and you don't even care really about

649.47 --> 656.3100000000001
what is it supposedly you know doesn't

653.91 --> 661.67
even matter anywhere it's just that's

656.31 --> 661.67
how it works that's the natural result

665.58 --> 673.36
so yeah sometimes there are like high

669.61 --> 679.9
infection risks situations where it does

673.36 --> 685.21
happen say if I were to yeah clean the

679.9 --> 686.89
toilet now because of just all the

685.21 --> 688.96
substances that are involved the ally

686.89 --> 690.9399999999999
especially in the toilet themselves and

688.96 --> 692.98
yeah the chance that anything could go

690.94 --> 696.9000000000001
wrong is extremely slim but say for

692.98 --> 699.22
example I got a little wound or

696.9 --> 701.47
appearing wound on a nail or something

699.22 --> 703.3000000000001
it happens to the best of us and you

701.47 --> 705.9
don't really take notice of it and then

703.3 --> 710.5899999999999
you put a glove on and everything and

705.9 --> 712.72
you're working and then suddenly the

710.59 --> 715.0
nits a nightmare situation pretty much

712.72 --> 719.25
but sadly as you're like right with your

715.0 --> 723.97
hand in it in the disgusting [ __ ] it

719.25 --> 726.04
hooks rips rips open a wound and

723.97 --> 730.0600000000001
immediately the open the glove yeah

726.04 --> 732.3399999999999
that's a [ __ ] up situation I don't

730.06 --> 735.79
remember that literally happening to me

732.34 --> 737.5
like that but close and I've had I've

735.79 --> 740.0799999999999
seen other people that it does happen to

737.5 --> 741.97
and just defeat this year trauma the

740.08 --> 744.5400000000001
psychosomatic pressure of the

741.97 --> 748.33
realization of that situation is enough

744.54 --> 750.43
to cause potential serious local trauma

748.33 --> 752.8000000000001
the site don't underestimate the

750.43 --> 755.7299999999999
psychosomatic influence of such a

752.8 --> 760.02
situation the psychosomatic response to

755.73 --> 762.52
the arrival of a wound is very important

760.02 --> 764.8
because if you're going to freaking

762.52 --> 767.52
panic about it and project oh my god

764.8 --> 771.5799999999999
this is going to happen that's gonna

767.52 --> 774.22
progress that potential type of thing

771.58 --> 777.82
actually rolling out it's real that's

774.22 --> 781.96
it's the craziness but it matters a lot

777.82 --> 784.1800000000001
so if you feel extremely strong and you

781.96 --> 785.77
know it and you have your senses come

784.18 --> 787.42
you're not suppressing any senses

785.77 --> 790.72
something like that happened and you

787.42 --> 792.64
just have the confidence like no this is

790.72 --> 794.37
nothing to worry about it just wash it

792.64 --> 799.889
off everything will be all right

794.37 --> 803.79
that actually works I've had situations

799.889 --> 806.279
like that but if you're just panicking

803.79 --> 808.86
right away the chance that it will get

806.279 --> 811.199
somehow infected or throbbing or

808.86 --> 814.86
something painful about it is just very

811.199 --> 816.809
high it's cuz of the psychosomatic

814.86 --> 818.73
response and probably the correlating

816.809 --> 821.009
hormones that get injected in your body

818.73 --> 824.839
as that happens and how everything then

821.009 --> 828.41
proceeds from their arm yes john-carlos

824.839 --> 828.4100000000001
yes really

829.67 --> 835.7299999999999
I'm getting into mysterious base

833.509 --> 840.839
assumptions and foundations of

835.73 --> 843.4490000000001
biological insight because yeah some

840.839 --> 845.85
people have doubts about molecules and

843.449 --> 847.529
items and kind of weird because it is

845.85 --> 853.0790000000001
kind of conceptual in the first place

847.529 --> 856.05
you know but there's similar issues with

853.079 --> 861.3
biology and like what are bacteria and

856.05 --> 863.429
viruses assumptions about hostility

861.3 --> 866.9989999999999
invasions that kind of thing

863.429 --> 869.61
well there is different approaches to

866.999 --> 872.839
that conceptualization out there for

869.61 --> 875.97
real very well-developed

872.839 --> 877.9490000000001
systems to approach it in different ways

875.97 --> 880.2900000000001
and one of them that I'm still amazed

877.949 --> 881.24
about to this day is the German new

880.29 --> 885.98
medicine

881.24 --> 888.8290000000001
it's very contrasting to everything else

885.98 --> 892.889
it's it's technically non

888.829 --> 898.079
interventionist if approach what what it

892.889 --> 901.8290000000001
teaches it's fascinating but I try to

898.079 --> 904.1099999999999
combine it I try to say look it just

901.829 --> 905.8789999999999
shows the cycle of things

904.11 --> 909.139
that's what German new medicine shows

905.879 --> 911.1
you just take away assumptions of

909.139 --> 913.889
hostilities and all these things and

911.1 --> 916.1990000000001
just see it as as this is the organic

913.889 --> 920.72
function and the spirit relates it's

916.199 --> 923.1289999999999
pretty astounding it's pretty like what

920.72 --> 926.65
first time so so it's just like this

923.129 --> 930.16
seems like New Age weird thing

926.65 --> 932.62
it was very surreal to me but there is

930.16 --> 937.81
just a lot there's actual empirical

932.62 --> 942.79
research that's gone and on yeah as a

937.81 --> 946.39
foundation to this it's actual empirical

942.79 --> 951.15
yeah very biology directed study it's

946.39 --> 951.15
not just some woozy thing

958.67 --> 967.3199999999999
so what that taught me

961.7 --> 969.9300000000001
Germany medicine is everything that

967.32 --> 973.74
happens to you in your life that has an

969.93 --> 977.9
impact as a consequence it's very weird

973.74 --> 981.51
there's like why certain pains arrive

977.9 --> 984.29
you know and everybody gets it in some

981.51 --> 987.6899999999999
way some kind of situation issue

984.29 --> 989.55
inflammation somewhere or density the

987.69 --> 991.95
weird stuff just suddenly pops up

989.55 --> 994.74
there's no really explanation seems

991.95 --> 997.0200000000001
almost like bacterial but it's not well

994.74 --> 1001.55
that is something that the German new

997.02 --> 1006.02
medicine actually directly takes hold

1001.55 --> 1009.9799999999999
off what that is how it works why and it

1006.02 --> 1013.4
is really interesting just to have seen

1009.98 --> 1015.32
and understand the concept to keep that

1013.4 --> 1016.97
in the back of your mind as you are

1015.32 --> 1019.34
confronted with everything and then you

1016.97 --> 1022.61
can always make up your mind but just to

1019.34 --> 1027.52
have that as something to reflect it

1022.61 --> 1027.52
upon is really handy I've noticed myself

1029.079 --> 1032.079
so

1033.76 --> 1040.61
yeah a bit about that look into it

1038.449 --> 1045.29
there's there's actually an online

1040.61 --> 1050.4799999999998
database about it let's see if I could

1045.29 --> 1055.87
share it to find it first

1050.48 --> 1055.8700000000001
I think this is in Dutch

1057.28 --> 1060.42
the ads Dutch

1061.55 --> 1068.4099999999999
but there must be others there must be

1064.64 --> 1068.41
other languages let's see if we can find

1069.61 --> 1092.4499999999998
out here all right owl there must be

1083.66 --> 1094.7900000000002
other versions anyway I'll try to get

1092.45 --> 1096.71
something sensible together and then put

1094.79 --> 1098.45
out the link for people to check it out

1096.71 --> 1099.89
because this is all Dutch yeah some

1098.45 --> 1101.92
people might find interesting but I'm

1099.89 --> 1107.14
not gonna put out Dutch links in there I

1101.92 --> 1107.14
draw water machine from Japan okay

1127.26 --> 1132.119
all right

1129.179 --> 1134.219
yeah bill G yeah those are the nasty

1132.119 --> 1142.649
type of things that can happen

1134.219 --> 1145.019
I myself yeah I wouldn't just leave I

1142.649 --> 1148.109
tend to if there's some infection going

1145.019 --> 1156.289
on I would typically try to get out the

1148.109 --> 1159.33
junk as well because it's good for good

1156.289 --> 1161.82
it's like if there is some kind of

1159.33 --> 1164.609
inflammation and it is like genuine

1161.82 --> 1170.789
infection from a wound a surface wound

1164.609 --> 1175.019
for example then yeah usually just wait

1170.789 --> 1177.869
until the the local that the local tents

1175.019 --> 1180.479
pain goes away and then eventually yeah

1177.869 --> 1184.259
you'll get all kinds of junk ejection as

1180.479 --> 1187.559
it were and the sooner that gets out of

1184.259 --> 1190.499
the way the quicker ill heal up so but

1187.559 --> 1195.299
it's just practical everybody knows

1190.499 --> 1202.169
about that I think everybody above 20

1195.299 --> 1205.259
should probably know about that if women

1202.169 --> 1205.919
bites are the witness once heart has

1205.259 --> 1210.08
been bitten

1205.919 --> 1210.0800000000002
ouch yeah

1217.59 --> 1238.62
although those are more metaphorical

1219.99 --> 1240.84
type wounds bite in the spirit yeah

1238.62 --> 1247.1699999999998
that's too much information thanks bill

1240.84 --> 1251.04
gee it's just it's did not proceed from

1247.17 --> 1254.15
there um thought it was already too much

1251.04 --> 1254.1499999999999
information really

1259.69 --> 1266.68
stay away from vampires - right huh by

1265.12 --> 1269.1999999999998
the way there has been a lot of bats

1266.68 --> 1276.19
flying around here like especially

1269.2 --> 1279.73
during the cold two days a lot of bats

1276.19 --> 1283.68
flying around this time even though it

1279.73 --> 1283.68
was very cold so I was kind of surprised

1296.05 --> 1304.09
so yeah geez

1300.17 --> 1304.0900000000001
now Riley's it's done

1307.38 --> 1314.91
Halloween bats yeah but they were living

1310.289 --> 1317.12
though they were not fake bats stupid

1314.91 --> 1317.1200000000001
Halloween

1324.14 --> 1330.65
and I've not seen any witches lie around

1326.86 --> 1335.53
although I hear there's been an arwing

1330.65 --> 1335.5300000000002
cited on the rooftops at night

1342.96 --> 1349.16
yeah I'm not flying around either so

1346.02 --> 1349.16
[Music]

1353.43 --> 1358.3100000000002
no no Jeffrey Bell definitely not

1376.169 --> 1383.21
really is the guarantee okay

1397.85 --> 1404.36
oh right so why are we supposed to talk

1402.86 --> 1407.59
about that now

1404.36 --> 1407.59
logical bananas

1431.04 --> 1437.35
right well illogical bananas new

1433.84 --> 1440.1
flattery developments well not in a

1437.35 --> 1445.24
technical sense that I've taken note off

1440.1 --> 1448.2099999999998
not beaten at anything big but on social

1445.24 --> 1451.36
platform wise yeah sure there's been a

1448.21 --> 1455.17
lot of things happening like when

1451.36 --> 1457.4099999999999
Benjamin like came out full full on Flat

1455.17 --> 1460.72
Earth pretty much in the last week and

1457.41 --> 1467.16
on the Infowars there was a very

1460.72 --> 1471.67
seriously worked out Flat Earth video

1467.16 --> 1473.28
very up-to-date and that's yeah it

1471.67 --> 1475.74
doesn't mean that they're now all

1473.28 --> 1479.35
immediately gonna be flat earthers

1475.74 --> 1483.19
probably not leads but it's at least

1479.35 --> 1486.3999999999999
like opening a door in a way so that's

1483.19 --> 1490.0
been happening but as for the technical

1486.4 --> 1492.25
yeah progress the only thing that's

1490.0 --> 1497.26
really going on in that region is just

1492.25 --> 1502.96
more ballers popping up and being more

1497.26 --> 1506.05
and more ridiculous getting more quick

1502.96 --> 1508.3500000000001
to make crazy assertions and us just

1506.05 --> 1511.36
pointing out how it's all insane and

1508.35 --> 1516.3999999999999
what all the fallacies are that's yeah

1511.36 --> 1518.8899999999999
that's really what's happening and in a

1516.4 --> 1521.89
way you could say that's boring it is

1518.89 --> 1524.17
kind of funny though because yeah these

1521.89 --> 1527.98
the ballers are getting quite quite

1524.17 --> 1531.22
naughty these days getting a really

1527.98 --> 1535.42
silly stretching the imagination to just

1531.22 --> 1537.1000000000001
somehow make things fit and like quickly

1535.42 --> 1543.46
believe this before you see that it

1537.1 --> 1545.6699999999998
doesn't work that's what they try to do

1543.46 --> 1545.67
now

1547.82 --> 1550.82
mmm

1571.24 --> 1574.329
[Music]

1577.13 --> 1584.2
oh really

1580.1 --> 1584.1999999999998
oh my god

1590.01 --> 1596.01
yeah but that's the thing logical

1592.32 --> 1598.02
bananas gravity would theoretically do

1596.01 --> 1601.53
it but the thing is it's not gonna be

1598.02 --> 1604.5
doing that outside of theory because

1601.53 --> 1606.78
there is no empirical data to back what

1604.5 --> 1609.809
gravity is or what it's even supposed to

1606.78 --> 1611.73
be doing so that thing that you don't

1609.809 --> 1615.059
know what it really is and what it's

1611.73 --> 1618.299
supposed to be doing can't hold the air

1615.059 --> 1621.98
onto a small little ball inside of a

1618.299 --> 1630.2
massive massive giant vacuum filled

1621.98 --> 1630.2
universe sized container that can't work

1631.549 --> 1640.11
it's a very raw quick painting to try to

1637.41 --> 1644.91
lay these connections with things but it

1640.11 --> 1651.33
doesn't work out you can't tie it down

1644.91 --> 1653.73
it's not doesn't last you can sort of

1651.33 --> 1656.76
see something in the story and then have

1653.73 --> 1660.35
a belief about it if you really work out

1656.76 --> 1660.35
the details it doesn't work

1672.06 --> 1679.7
really to retro a few Arwen's

1676.31 --> 1679.7
how funny

1693.92 --> 1699.3500000000001
you do realize that genuine Darwin's

1697.1 --> 1700.85
only ask for organic candy right

1699.35 --> 1703.0
otherwise they're just not going to do

1700.85 --> 1703.0
it

1709.43 --> 1714.01
oh right right

1724.17 --> 1731.67
what stops the atmosphere from vanishing

1727.1 --> 1734.9699999999998
well the fact that it's all in a

1731.67 --> 1738.8600000000001
container has nowhere to vanish - that's

1734.97 --> 1738.8600000000001
what stops it from vanishing

1740.91 --> 1744.0990000000002
[Music]

1748.68 --> 1751.3700000000001
hmm

1764.78 --> 1775.1299999999999
while george sanford Owen Smith I you

1770.1 --> 1779.79
probably mean Owen Benjamin right right

1775.13 --> 1782.73
well yeah he definitely said yes flat

1779.79 --> 1787.77
the earth is flat what why don't you

1782.73 --> 1793.98
listen to like the last five six videos

1787.77 --> 1799.5
he put out its um his specific video

1793.98 --> 1802.8600000000001
channel an authorized TV you don't have

1799.5 --> 1805.89
to be a member to watch it but I

1802.86 --> 1808.7099999999998
definitely recommend that you do become

1805.89 --> 1813.0900000000001
a member if you can afford it I would if

1808.71 --> 1815.04
I could eventually I hoped it yeah when

1813.09 --> 1817.77
I'm doing a lot better financially more

1815.04 --> 1821.27
stable more left over us to do such

1817.77 --> 1824.4
things I will probably subscribe yeah

1821.27 --> 1827.01
get a paid subscription because it's

1824.4 --> 1831.0300000000002
just yeah it's gravy I love what he's

1827.01 --> 1836.03
doing very intense very intense he

1831.03 --> 1839.48
really like puts it on the knife's edge

1836.03 --> 1839.48
it's heavy stuff

1848.43 --> 1856.2
nah yeah well George Sanford you haven't

1852.06 --> 1859.56
watched them all because I have yeah he

1856.2 --> 1862.92
calls it around but yours now your straw

1859.56 --> 1864.96
Manning me that's another that's how he

1862.92 --> 1866.97
describes the world he calls it the

1864.96 --> 1869.82
realm yeah that's how what I do is well

1866.97 --> 1871.83
I call it a realm especially with my

1869.82 --> 1875.49
looping conceptualizations that's an

1871.83 --> 1878.07
absolute must but he does say that the

1875.49 --> 1881.91
earth is flat that it's flat that it's

1878.07 --> 1886.29
not curved like that so just because he

1881.91 --> 1894.38
doesn't say Flat Earth or the earth is

1886.29 --> 1896.94
flat or a model doesn't mean that he

1894.38 --> 1899.94
yeah that he's like shying away from

1896.94 --> 1903.3600000000001
saying the earth is flat and that was an

1899.94 --> 1904.89
issue like months ago he would just talk

1903.36 --> 1907.6699999999998
about the moon landing no he's gonna

1904.89 --> 1907.67
fall out now

1912.51 --> 1915.29
okay

1924.29 --> 1933.23
explain the looping right well the

1927.77 --> 1940.309
looping aspect is a way to try to

1933.23 --> 1943.25
conceptualize what this realm is and the

1940.309 --> 1946.61
looping aspect would point at that there

1943.25 --> 1949.16
is literally a limit to the confine of

1946.61 --> 1951.86
the realm itself not because of

1949.16 --> 1956.39
necessarily barriers at least not in all

1951.86 --> 1959.78
directions but because yeah the spin the

1956.39 --> 1964.7900000000002
finiteness of the space loops in on

1959.78 --> 1968.03
itself in a specific direction the first

1964.79 --> 1971.3899999999999
claim to they added that could be

1968.03 --> 1975.11
confirmed would be that is the West the

1971.39 --> 1983.0300000000002
realm loops and the way to confirm it is

1975.11 --> 1986.75
to see if the substracted equator line

1983.03 --> 1989.45
which is derived from how the Sun

1986.75 --> 1994.28
basically we are well aware is it at its

1989.45 --> 1995.72
height and at its highest to determine

1994.28 --> 1998.3899999999999
where the Equator is all that the star

1995.72 --> 2002.14
positions everything combines and then

1998.39 --> 2006.01
just see if if the equator line is

2002.14 --> 2010.21
indeed a circle a literal circle where

2006.01 --> 2013.09
you literally go about 360 degrees as

2010.21 --> 2017.38
you move over it and end up at the same

2013.09 --> 2019.99
place but if it's not if it's only for

2017.38 --> 2022.48
example 180 degrees now that's confusing

2019.99 --> 2025.69
but it could also be that it may turn

2022.48 --> 2030.429
out to be a literal straight line or

2025.69 --> 2034.0
almost straight and if you're going to

2030.429 --> 2037.15
assume by that standard that ever that

2034.0 --> 2039.46
space itself is all literal then you're

2037.15 --> 2045.3700000000001
gonna have a very confusing time to

2039.46 --> 2047.44
explain what the earth realm is when

2045.37 --> 2049.69
it's all still flat yep

2047.44 --> 2052.409
that's the layout that's how it's all

2049.69 --> 2054.82
connected it's just weird

2052.409 --> 2056.619
rotating no rotation there is no

2054.82 --> 2058.1490000000003
rotation the only thing that rotates is

2056.619 --> 2061.2200000000003
the light

2058.149 --> 2064.19
the damn my globe of the heavens that

2061.22 --> 2068.54
surrounds us and that all of us see from

2064.19 --> 2075.71
their own specific angle that is what

2068.54 --> 2077.75
spinning global - heavens yeah and the

2075.71 --> 2081.35
Sun and the moon are a part of the globe

2077.75 --> 2085.06
of the heavens all the lights moon Sun

2081.35 --> 2085.06
stars planets everything

2093.34 --> 2101.05
really Phil Cooper I I strongly disagree

2098.32 --> 2104.29
with that very very strongly disagree

2101.05 --> 2107.0800000000004
the phenomena that stops you picking up

2104.29 --> 2109.2599999999998
a car has absolutely nothing to do with

2107.08 --> 2116.29
density and buoyancy yeah does it

2109.26 --> 2118.7200000000003
absolutely does okay because that car

2116.29 --> 2120.52
that heavy heavy car that you presumed

2118.72 --> 2122.98
is being told towards the center of the

2120.52 --> 2125.47
earth but gravity right that thing is

2122.98 --> 2128.89
very heavy right when you try to move it

2125.47 --> 2131.02
you know why because the but combined

2128.89 --> 2134.98
materials all of it out of the chassis

2131.02 --> 2138.58
that's all steel so it's a big lump of

2134.98 --> 2140.5
solid steel that when you compare it to

2138.58 --> 2141.67
what it's surrounded by which is

2140.5 --> 2144.16
probably air you're probably gonna

2141.67 --> 2146.41
approach that thing in air that's what

2144.16 --> 2150.19
it's going to be sitting in that air has

2146.41 --> 2153.6099999999997
an extremely low density compared to the

2150.19 --> 2156.55
average density of that car okay

2153.61 --> 2160.3
extremely low compared to it yet the car

2156.55 --> 2162.82
can't move any further towards supposed

2160.3 --> 2164.77
equilibrium point because yeah the

2162.82 --> 2168.19
wheels are preventing it from moving

2164.77 --> 2170.2
that way stuck but it's not an

2168.19 --> 2176.5
equilibrium so what does happen instead

2170.2 --> 2180.6699999999996
well be entire cars all of that matter

2176.5 --> 2182.74
is gonna push because it can't move

2180.67 --> 2185.5
further towards its equilibrium is

2182.74 --> 2188.2599999999998
instead gonna push pressure downwards

2185.5 --> 2190.51
with all of its all of its weight all of

2188.26 --> 2193.15
its mass all of its density it's gonna

2190.51 --> 2196.8100000000004
push down on whatever stopping it from

2193.15 --> 2199.33
moving further and that pressure that

2196.81 --> 2203.0499999999997
pressure caused by relative density this

2199.33 --> 2206.47
equilibrium that is very tough to

2203.05 --> 2209.29
overcome if you are trying to move that

2206.47 --> 2211.2999999999997
car because that pressure is a lot of

2209.29 --> 2216.6
pressure caused by relative density

2211.3 --> 2216.6000000000004
disequilibrium yeah okay

2220.61 --> 2227.63
what's pushing it the force that arrives

2224.75 --> 2231.08
when an object is not at equilibrium

2227.63 --> 2233.4500000000003
with its surroundings and the car is

2231.08 --> 2235.45
definitely not at equilibrium with its

2233.45 --> 2239.81
surroundings because it's surrounded by

2235.45 --> 2242.81
air and not for example a pool of

2239.81 --> 2245.72
mercury it might actually float in a

2242.81 --> 2248.18
pool of mercury let's not test that but

2245.72 --> 2251.54
mercury is very heavy yeah the car might

2248.18 --> 2256.52
actually start to stop exerting that

2251.54 --> 2258.35
pressure directly to to the ground on

2256.52 --> 2261.83
which it's resting when it's surrounded

2258.35 --> 2263.96
by air because yeah mercury is much

2261.83 --> 2267.2599999999998
denser so it might actually float in

2263.96 --> 2269.45
there then it's not gonna push down what

2267.26 --> 2272.51
it is gonna push down however is the

2269.45 --> 2276.08
entire pool with the mercury and the car

2272.51 --> 2278.0
all of it that is gonna still exert the

2276.08 --> 2281.2599999999998
pressure because it is not in

2278.0 --> 2287.18
equilibrium because it's surrounded by

2281.26 --> 2291.0800000000004
solid matter that is not yeah it's not

2287.18 --> 2296.35
its own weight it's not its own density

2291.08 --> 2296.35
it's yeah it's still gonna go down

2297.589 --> 2302.249
now whatever is resting underneath that

2300.539 --> 2304.0490000000004
pool yet it's going to get some extra

2302.249 --> 2306.2889999999998
pressure because it still wants to go

2304.049 --> 2306.2889999999998
down

2314.4 --> 2321.33
and yeah what force is that that's

2316.44 --> 2325.02
relative density disequilibrium it wants

2321.33 --> 2327.9
to go down because it's heavier than

2325.02 --> 2332.15
what's surrounding it or heavier it's

2327.9 --> 2332.15
denser than what's surrounding it

2350.12 --> 2355.98
transferring the energy what is while

2353.28 --> 2357.8100000000004
the transfer is the object not being at

2355.98 --> 2362.1
equilibrium with its surroundings

2357.81 --> 2365.42
that's the condition that is what causes

2362.1 --> 2365.42
the force in a rise

2373.4 --> 2378.17
they and whatever brought that thing

2375.52 --> 2381.53
into that position yeah that could be

2378.17 --> 2385.2200000000003
considered as a pre chain of events

2381.53 --> 2387.0800000000004
whatever that's another that's so that's

2385.22 --> 2388.49
the whole chain of events type of

2387.08 --> 2392.54
thinking it's not really all that

2388.49 --> 2395.8999999999996
relevant to me but yeah the relative

2392.54 --> 2399.86
density this equilibrium is what causes

2395.9 --> 2402.14
the force in the object to arrive and

2399.86 --> 2406.67
that's how it works

2402.14 --> 2412.7
provably so yeah there is no answer as

2406.67 --> 2417.2000000000003
to why down it just is down dancer goes

2412.7 --> 2420.56
down less dance goes up live with it

2417.2 --> 2429.35
that's how it is you know that's how it

2420.56 --> 2431.39
is you can't prove why I can't and I

2429.35 --> 2436.45
don't really want to anymore don't give

2431.39 --> 2436.45
a [ __ ] I just know it works like this oh

2439.8 --> 2443.42
[Music]

2441.04 --> 2445.13
the answer is gravity you don't even

2443.42 --> 2447.86
know what gravity is you bunch of

2445.13 --> 2451.58
retards you all want times timeouts

2447.86 --> 2454.13
after all that time you're really gonna

2451.58 --> 2456.97
assert gravity again despite everything

2454.13 --> 2456.9700000000003
that's happened

2460.03 --> 2465.8900000000003
shut up star is a ghost first you don't

2464.12 --> 2468.68
talk and now you're gonna just make this

2465.89 --> 2471.1099999999997
troll remark piss off and you too

2468.68 --> 2474.73
Allenby you're just gonna go away right

2471.11 --> 2474.73
away bang goodbye

2478.78 --> 2487.099
yeah goodbye anymore any more assertions

2484.82 --> 2489.65
out of nothing of something you

2487.099 --> 2491.75
literally do not know what it is and

2489.65 --> 2495.5
what it even does despite your

2491.75 --> 2499.3
fantastical assertions about some guy a

2495.5 --> 2503.08
few centuries ago that conceptualized

2499.3 --> 2505.6400000000003
motion mechanics and then inserted a

2503.08 --> 2507.77
gravity concept for which he never

2505.64 --> 2514.46
claimed the hypothesis you freaking

2507.77 --> 2520.96
morons it's a concept it's not real it's

2514.46 --> 2520.96
not real there is no gravity

2541.849 --> 2549.489
so anymore no one nonsense assertions

2546.709 --> 2549.489
about gravity

2553.65 --> 2557.119
[Music]

2571.37 --> 2577.37
hmm Thank You velji I like to think so

2575.36 --> 2580.4900000000002
I'd like to think that my model is

2577.37 --> 2583.6099999999997
viable even though that varies a real

2580.49 --> 2587.0
nature of the looping concept that's a

2583.61 --> 2589.13
big obstacle to overcome but hey seems

2587.0 --> 2591.11
like the heavenly bodies are all

2589.13 --> 2593.21
holographic in nature that's already

2591.11 --> 2599.4500000000003
pretty surreal so if that seems to be

2593.21 --> 2602.63
the case then why not you know that's

2599.45 --> 2604.49
how I approach it I'm not saying it is

2602.63 --> 2608.3900000000003
like that I'm just saying it could be

2604.49 --> 2610.58
and already said how you could figure

2608.39 --> 2613.1299999999997
out if that might be the case and what

2610.58 --> 2615.85
you could expect to bump into as you

2613.13 --> 2615.85
research it

2631.36 --> 2634.36
it

2634.78 --> 2641.17
I do bunked gravity by repeating

2637.599 --> 2642.76
Cavendish experiment lols I don't know

2641.17 --> 2644.53
how that's even yea the Cavendish

2642.76 --> 2646.869
experiment wasn't even supposed to be

2644.53 --> 2652.7400000000002
proofing gravity it's asserting it in

2646.869 --> 2656.8
the very concept that's the funny thing

2652.74 --> 2659.47
it's first you assume gravity then you

2656.8 --> 2662.67
start to derive conclusions based on

2659.47 --> 2665.2599999999998
that assumption with mechanics and then

2662.67 --> 2667.33
things are extrapolated about the

2665.26 --> 2669.67
presuppositions of the globe earth and

2667.33 --> 2672.64
the heavens outside that are all

2669.67 --> 2674.23
presupposed that's what the Cavendish

2672.64 --> 2676.9
experiment really is it doesn't even

2674.23 --> 2680.38
prove gravity that's the silly thing

2676.9 --> 2683.71
about it it just makes people think that

2680.38 --> 2687.28
because of the superficial claim the

2683.71 --> 2690.52
rumor that's been gone around forever

2687.28 --> 2692.32
through schools no less and TV about

2690.52 --> 2694.72
gravity being mass attracted by mass

2692.32 --> 2697.9
despite that Newton himself did not

2694.72 --> 2706.1499999999996
claim a hypothesis for this to be real

2697.9 --> 2711.849
for gravitation to be real no I don't

2706.15 --> 2716.01
know Spanish I recognise Spanish I may

2711.849 --> 2719.56
understand some parts of it but no I

2716.01 --> 2722.76
don't know how to speak Spanish

2719.56 --> 2722.7599999999998
[Music]

2735.61 --> 2743.38
what that's that's a total circular

2740.71 --> 2746.71
argument there Sparrow music I think the

2743.38 --> 2749.23
argument Arwen is that you don't fully

2746.71 --> 2751.33
understand gravity yourself so if you

2749.23 --> 2754.2400000000002
don't really know the model you cannot

2751.33 --> 2756.49
really deny it now that's you're

2754.24 --> 2760.6
reversing the burden you're telling me I

2756.49 --> 2763.8999999999996
don't understand what I'm saying is you

2760.6 --> 2766.33
don't understand and you have no proof

2763.9 --> 2767.89
to back up your presupposed

2766.33 --> 2770.41
understanding for it

2767.89 --> 2771.64
so you can then tell me you but you

2770.41 --> 2773.74
can't explain it

2771.64 --> 2776.2599999999998
because I already explained to you that

2773.74 --> 2778.0299999999997
there is no explanation to be found

2776.26 --> 2780.9700000000003
can't be traced

2778.03 --> 2783.63
fully explain that don't reverse the

2780.97 --> 2788.9199999999996
burden of proof on me you [ __ ]

2783.63 --> 2792.6
[ __ ] sake yeah you want a timeout you

2788.92 --> 2795.6
want timeout for being a straight-out

2792.6 --> 2795.6
dick

2799.19 --> 2806.42
the [ __ ] wrong with you you don't

2804.14 --> 2809.0899999999997
understand what gravity is nobody

2806.42 --> 2811.31
understands what gravity is because it

2809.09 --> 2815.54
isn't anything it's a bunch of rumors

2811.31 --> 2818.48
that have been allowed to borrow into

2815.54 --> 2821.5
cultural society and perpetuated by

2818.48 --> 2824.09
false teachings in schools and [ __ ]

2821.5 --> 2826.04
so everybody believes there is some kind

2824.09 --> 2826.52
of gravity but nobody really knows what

2826.04 --> 2828.89
it is

2826.52 --> 2830.57
they just know the superficial rumors

2828.89 --> 2833.33
and then when you look into those rumors

2830.57 --> 2835.3700000000003
you find out that there's no science at

2833.33 --> 2837.7599999999998
the foundation of it even by those that

2835.37 --> 2841.46
supposedly invent that the very concept

2837.76 --> 2843.59
but still you keep on claiming there is

2841.46 --> 2847.31
it it's there though because I've heard

2843.59 --> 2850.63
about it all my life it's there really

2847.31 --> 2854.63
you just you just don't know what it is

2850.63 --> 2856.55
you don't know what it is yeah you don't

2854.63 --> 2859.4500000000003
know what it is nobody knows what it is

2856.55 --> 2866.3300000000004
because it isn't anything it's nonsense

2859.45 --> 2867.83
it's a bunch of rumors it's it's kooky

2866.33 --> 2872.2999999999997
as hell it doesn't make any logical

2867.83 --> 2876.71
sense can't be proven scientifically

2872.3 --> 2878.9300000000003
it's just a waste of time why don't you

2876.71 --> 2881.9900000000002
try some actual scientific foundations

2878.93 --> 2885.2
like using relative density in which I

2881.99 --> 2888.3799999999997
can absolutely explain anything related

2885.2 --> 2890.39
to actual presupposed gravity here on

2888.38 --> 2892.79
earth because yeah all that nonsense

2890.39 --> 2894.3199999999997
that speculated about it outside of the

2892.79 --> 2896.69
presupposed globe I'm not even gonna

2894.32 --> 2901.1000000000004
touch that with relative density I might

2896.69 --> 2905.08
make jokes of it because technically yes

2901.1 --> 2908.8399999999997
I can literally explain anything

2905.08 --> 2911.63
anything that goes into the concept of

2908.84 --> 2912.7000000000003
gravity supposedly being a force of any

2911.63 --> 2915.05
kind

2912.7 --> 2917.93
whoever takes that seriously I could

2915.05 --> 2920.1800000000003
just immediately replace that notion of

2917.93 --> 2922.7
that form of gravity that they are

2920.18 --> 2925.64
imagining with relative density to the

2922.7 --> 2927.2599999999998
full I could even say like oh it's it's

2925.64 --> 2929.5099999999998
zero gravity

2927.26 --> 2932.78
oh you mean neutralizer the relative

2929.51 --> 2935.57
density it's like forced equally

2932.78 --> 2939.65
in relative density because that is what

2935.57 --> 2942.38
that is it's not neutral gravity it's

2939.65 --> 2945.53
not neutralized no it's the relative

2942.38 --> 2949.07
density thing that real thing that's

2945.53 --> 2951.1400000000003
provably there is neutralized could be

2949.07 --> 2952.55
explained by the very motion that the

2951.14 --> 2954.74
whole thing is in when you're talking

2952.55 --> 2956.63
about the diving plane all that that's

2954.74 --> 2958.4599999999996
the only practical example you can get

2956.63 --> 2960.59
to it but hey if somebody's gonna

2958.46 --> 2963.71
imagine about gravity in outer space you

2960.59 --> 2967.82
could just say oh you mean relatively

2963.71 --> 2970.61
like direct Direction specific relative

2967.82 --> 2973.81
density because I can definitely call it

2970.61 --> 2976.52
that it would make a lot more sense

2973.81 --> 2979.57
immediately because it's not nonsense

2976.52 --> 2982.06
gravity theory that has no scientific

2979.57 --> 2985.2200000000003
foundations even by the original

2982.06 --> 2988.52
conceptual Iser of it Newton Newton

2985.22 --> 2992.06
himself that did not officially noted

2988.52 --> 2999.41
did not claim and hypotheses for

2992.06 --> 3001.6
gravitation there is no formula for

2999.41 --> 3007.7799999999997
gravity Sparrow music gravity is not a

3001.6 --> 3011.17
thing it's a rumor it's science fiction

3007.78 --> 3013.3500000000004
that's been culturally forced down

3011.17 --> 3016.51
everybody's throat so people believe it

3013.35 --> 3018.66
even though there is no actual

3016.51 --> 3023.0200000000004
foundation to back up any of the

3018.66 --> 3024.8399999999997
conceptualizations for it my relative

3023.02 --> 3026.77
density theory backs up the

3024.84 --> 3029.94
conceptualizations for it a lot better

3026.77 --> 3029.94
this is

3035.38 --> 3049.01
what prove what wait I have to prove

3042.94 --> 3052.91
that gravity is not real I I don't think

3049.01 --> 3055.3700000000003
that's how it works I don't you know

3052.91 --> 3057.92
usually the person that makes the claim

3055.37 --> 3060.62
of something to be real presupposed

3057.92 --> 3063.2000000000003
phenomena called gravity then the burden

3060.62 --> 3066.7
of proof lies with them not with the

3063.2 --> 3066.7
person saying it doesn't exist

3081.22 --> 3088.9599999999996
Oh mom I can't read my credentials

3084.43 --> 3093.73
nickfear is that your band for starters

3088.96 --> 3098.849
and the very facts and words that I use

3093.73 --> 3102.55
that can be searched out looked up in

3098.849 --> 3106.02
University literature in official ease

3102.55 --> 3109.54
scientific documents in a lot of things

3106.02 --> 3111.579
it's real I don't need any freaking

3109.54 --> 3115.869
credentials to present any of this you

3111.579 --> 3117.3100000000004
can just listen to my words especially

3115.869 --> 3121.54
when I'm being very specific about

3117.31 --> 3125.349
something and then look it up look it up

3121.54 --> 3128.02
for yourself see what I'm referring to

3125.349 --> 3129.579
see if some of what I'm saying is

3128.02 --> 3135.64
actually credible is actually being

3129.579 --> 3137.71
relayed by facial documents so no by the

3135.64 --> 3139.75
way drunken bullet for one thank you for

3137.71 --> 3142.78
the two Australian dollar super chair

3139.75 --> 3149.819
donation no just say croissant please

[Music]

3154.369 --> 3161.9
it's really misunderstood yeah indeed

3158.689 --> 3164.839
gravity is really misunderstood people

3161.9 --> 3166.67
think it's real but it's a delusion bad

3164.839 --> 3169.359
better well belief gravity is

3166.67 --> 3169.359
misunderstood

3209.17 --> 3217.089
this is well yeah hey you that's exactly

3214.0 --> 3220.21
what that is and you says here prove

3217.089 --> 3222.369
gravity is like saying prove to me how

3220.21 --> 3224.349
made-up stories work yeah that's

3222.369 --> 3227.0190000000002
couldn't have said it better myself

3224.349 --> 3229.9300000000003
oh by the way thank you again dragon

3227.019 --> 3233.41
bullet for one he said it my night is

3229.93 --> 3237.96
complete you have one on me okay thanks

3233.41 --> 3240.97
thanks again $5.00 ship yet

3237.96 --> 3243.099
yeah and everybody don't forget to pay

3240.97 --> 3246.73
pal as well it's it's funny you know

3243.099 --> 3249.369

3264.88 --> 3270.76
well so yeah I think I'm gonna get

3268.869 --> 3272.92
towards rounding out the show and then

3270.76 --> 3280.67

3272.92 --> 3280.67
[Music]

3285.24 --> 3288.4199999999996
[Music]

3290.23 --> 3295.57
no that's fine drunk and bloated for one

3292.359 --> 3297.7799999999997
thanks for thanks for the superjet it's

3295.57 --> 3297.78
fine

3311.33 --> 3318.83
okay so star is a test your phenomena of

3315.14 --> 3322.31
what proves what gravity is is that if

3318.83 --> 3327.34
it wouldn't be there and then you could

3322.31 --> 3327.34
fly makes a lot of sense

3334.1 --> 3340.94
oh did I forget your super chat dank I

3336.79 --> 3345.62
did I miss it oh yeah I did

3340.94 --> 3347.81
oh thanks I did just completely

3345.62 --> 3351.74
overlooked that yeah thanks dank for the

3347.81 --> 3352.04
$5 super detonation ballers on suicide

3351.74 --> 3358.0099999999998
watch

3352.04 --> 3362.45
Oh their concept is definitely on

3358.01 --> 3365.63
suicide watch the ball itself I hope

3362.45 --> 3368.6
they're doing all right but yeah they're

3365.63 --> 3370.4
bound to be under great pressure but I

3368.6 --> 3373.31
think that most of the pressure really

3370.4 --> 3376.4
comes from the the fanaticism of them

3373.31 --> 3378.17
doubling down in such crazy

3376.4 --> 3389.17
circumstances I think that's probably

3378.17 --> 3391.66
the most pressure anyway thanks dank

3389.17 --> 3398.51
[Music]

3391.66 --> 3402.5
yeah interesting a lot of gravity black

3398.51 --> 3409.01
holes black holes yeah fantastical

3402.5 --> 3413.24
concept did you know that before I was

3409.01 --> 3417.32
into flat earth like say 20 more than 20

3413.24 --> 3421.7299999999996
years ago that I I was seriously

3417.32 --> 3424.31
considering that all suns the fiery ball

3421.73 --> 3427.37
Suns that they may all contain black

3424.31 --> 3430.16
holes and that that is what causes the

3427.37 --> 3435.49
blackness of sunspots that there's

3430.16 --> 3439.54
actually a black hole underneath it and

3435.49 --> 3442.7299999999996
it might be time bound that it's like a

3439.54 --> 3446.9
proceeding of the black hole that's

3442.73 --> 3449.3
already there but that around it it's

3446.9 --> 3451.58
just not manifesting yet because it's

3449.3 --> 3454.9300000000003
stuck in time I don't know you can go as

3451.58 --> 3454.93
fantastic with that as you like

3455.07 --> 3461.4300000000003
but yeah pretty sure that the son is not

3459.69 --> 3463.41
a giant ball of fire I'm pretty sure

3461.43 --> 3467.49
that it's just light coming from a very

3463.41 --> 3470.22
specific direction and unleashing light

3467.49 --> 3477.0299999999997
energy on the world that is being

3470.22 --> 3480.5699999999997
absorbed and transformed and yeah it

3477.03 --> 3484.25
helps transform matter a change creating

3480.57 --> 3484.25
all these processes in life itself

3487.7 --> 3494.85
now Sparrow music it's really about

3490.59 --> 3497.25
punishing like real stupidity it's not

3494.85 --> 3501.15
about blocking or timing out people it's

3497.25 --> 3503.7
about everything I've explained very

3501.15 --> 3509.28
carefully very very carefully and then

3503.7 --> 3514.1899999999996
when I finish just immediately like a

3509.28 --> 3517.8
handful of people all immediately just

3514.19 --> 3521.31
assert gravity after I just detailed

3517.8 --> 3523.53
fine chisel every little factor about it

3521.31 --> 3527.75
that's just a direct insult it's a

3523.53 --> 3531.03
direct insult of an intelligence that's

3527.75 --> 3533.7
then yeah then I get pissed off it's

3531.03 --> 3537.5600000000004
about the timing it's about the level of

3533.7 --> 3540.4199999999996
retardation that it shows that you

3537.56 --> 3542.5499999999997
asserted gravity at that point it at

3540.42 --> 3545.01
that point of the conversation at that

3542.55 --> 3546.0
point of my hangout just right after I

3545.01 --> 3549.9
explained all that

3546.0 --> 3557.13
that is what fires me up it's the insult

3549.9 --> 3560.61
of intelligence not disagreeing you know

3557.13 --> 3563.96
what is even disagreeing if you disagree

3560.61 --> 3567.54
about something then they there must be

3563.96 --> 3569.94
information in order to found the

3567.54 --> 3572.25
disagreement oh if you're just gonna

3569.94 --> 3575.64
ignore everything and don't give

3572.25 --> 3577.86
something that actually sort of gifts

3575.64 --> 3580.5899999999997
foundation to a disagreement then you're

3577.86 --> 3584.9300000000003
not even disagreeing you're just getting

3580.59 --> 3584.9300000000003
in the way you're just being a dumbass

3588.08 --> 3595.2
so no I don't block people who disagree

3592.56 --> 3599.09
I block people who are acting like

3595.2 --> 3603.12
absolute retards or are literally

3599.09 --> 3607.13
insulting their own intelligence and my

3603.12 --> 3609.96
intelligent everyone my audience and

3607.13 --> 3613.11
