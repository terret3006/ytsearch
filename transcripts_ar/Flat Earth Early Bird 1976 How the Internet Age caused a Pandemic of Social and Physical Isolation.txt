again

84.88 --> 92.0
so anyway the

87.64 --> 95.49
weather is yeah very similar to

92.0 --> 100.799
yesterday more clouded

95.49 --> 103.79899999999999
[Music]

100.799 --> 103.799
even

108.2 --> 113.68
somebody's somebody's doing some home

110.799 --> 115.84
drilling or whatever downstairs so

113.68 --> 121.52000000000001
that's what you're

115.84 --> 121.52000000000001
hearing but uh yeah big clouds

122.439 --> 129.2
was just a little bit of sun earlier but

125.039 --> 129.2
not that much because it's just mostly

134.64 --> 141.51899999999998
clouded despite that it does feel like

138.28 --> 145.44
still decently warm

141.519 --> 146.20000000000002
so yeah although it probably isn't all

145.44 --> 148.84
that

146.2 --> 155.11999999999998
warm

148.84 --> 155.12
anyway it is Thursday the 13th of June

159.08 --> 163.72
2024 temperature is 18°

163.76 --> 170.879
C only

165.72 --> 172.44
one% precipitation but 49%

170.879 --> 174.67999999999998
humidity

172.44 --> 178.519
yeah looks like it's just going to be

174.68 --> 178.519
kind of a cloudy day

207.879 --> 214.56
right yeah yes they should I mean it it

211.28 --> 216.08
went all right but I was very cranky got

214.56 --> 218.599
the feeling that today is not going to

216.08 --> 218.59900000000002
be like

219.4 --> 223.68
that I feel much more well

227.56 --> 235.0
rested hello Moxy first in

230.519 --> 235.0
chat what is that

248.12 --> 251.36
what is that is that a

253.92 --> 260.759
cow the driller sounds like a cow

257.799 --> 263.63899999999995
oh yeah I guess you could interpret it

260.759 --> 268.40000000000003
that like that a little

263.639 --> 268.40000000000003
bit I understand how you hear that in

268.56 --> 273.919
there right

271.52 --> 276.59999999999997
right yeah I know the mic's not picking

273.919 --> 278.79999999999995
it up too big and that's good because

276.6 --> 282.12
it's just annoying I mean I pick it up

278.8 --> 284.199
very loudly with my own ears but I'm

282.12 --> 287.4
just going to have to live with that

284.199 --> 287.40000000000003
hello clutch good to see

290.72 --> 295.88000000000005
you oh and I have to switch browsers

302.08 --> 305.08
because

306.08 --> 312.44
oh so typical every time it's like oh

309.28 --> 314.32
Firefox is like crashing or something

312.44 --> 317.52
switch browsers then as soon as I switch

314.32 --> 318.56
brows oh no no no no use me I'm working

317.52 --> 322.12
again

318.56 --> 322.12
really it's very

323.12 --> 327.12
typical right

334.24 --> 339.039
oh yeah yeah clutch had another stream

336.199 --> 341.08000000000004
yesterday and Speak Easy Saloon with the

339.039 --> 344.56
c Springs

341.08 --> 344.56
queen that was

347.319 --> 353.52000000000004
entertaining it's always a nice

349.24 --> 353.52
conversation you two have and then

353.96 --> 362.15999999999997
like cold ring screens wa reads out the

358.639 --> 362.16
chat so that's

380.4 --> 384.4
fun right

392.199 --> 398.36
right so yeah my idea yesterday of the

395.12 --> 400.479
pantheon mythologies I mean I thought

398.36 --> 401.52000000000004
it's a really good idea but it just

400.479 --> 403.4
didn't

401.52 --> 407.52
really hit

403.4 --> 407.52
off so I'll just leave it

408.16 --> 413.40000000000003
there and move on to other subjects

421.199 --> 425.84000000000003
Benjamin had some

423.759 --> 428.039
interesting like he's into like this

425.84 --> 428.039
sort

428.759 --> 434.639
of geopolitical

431.599 --> 437.28
esoterics recently it's very

434.639 --> 439.52
interesting it's very like statecraft

437.28 --> 439.52
like

444.96 --> 452.28
thinking also noticed that Mark Sergeant

447.68 --> 455.96
like uploaded a whole whole bunch of

452.28 --> 458.87899999999996
uh Flat Earth and H hot potatoes from

455.96 --> 460.31899999999996
way back on the channel I think that

458.879 --> 463.12
those are probably the episodes that

460.319 --> 465.72
were originally deleted when Patricia

463.12 --> 465.72
took down her

467.919 --> 472.87899999999996
channel so they're now on Mark

470.28 --> 472.87899999999996
Sergeant's

474.45 --> 481.44
[Music]

477.12 --> 481.44
Channel see what else

494.319 --> 500.759
oh yeah I did actually watch Patricia

497.44 --> 500.759
steers show with Mark

502.08 --> 506.24
Sergeant but they had severe sound

504.599 --> 509.96
issues at the

506.24 --> 511.56
beginning like for a very long time

509.96 --> 514.56
it was a total

511.56 --> 517.2
mess and to be fair I kind of got too

514.56 --> 520.039
distracted and didn't get beyond that

517.2 --> 521.76
but it's uh kind of hilarious to see

520.039 --> 525.24
that that's

521.76 --> 527.88
still after all these years still issues

525.24 --> 531.08
can happen with the show like that and

527.88 --> 534.24
by the way funnily enough so did like

531.08 --> 537.279
the Alex Jones Show like that's very

534.24 --> 539.839
rare but Alex just came on on his first

537.279 --> 543.16
hour on the show and then like for first

539.839 --> 546.2790000000001
6 minutes it was just completely on

543.16 --> 551.16
mute like the chat was just shouting

546.279 --> 554.6
like h no sound mute and just no

551.16 --> 557.64
response until after 6 minutes like it

554.6 --> 561.44
was just really silly but yeah sound

557.64 --> 561.4399999999999
issues as well that was kind of

561.88 --> 567.92
weird well I'm not having sound issues

564.839 --> 570.5600000000001
other than somebody like Drilling in the

567.92 --> 574.24
background

570.56 --> 574.2399999999999
but I think sound is just working

581.76 --> 585.64
fine didn't know over

586.72 --> 592.9200000000001
there yeah I didn't see Moxy either but

590.6 --> 595.2
might just not be

592.92 --> 597.68
commenting all right anyway how are you

595.2 --> 601.32
two hope you're doing

597.68 --> 601.3199999999999
good this Thursday

605.12 --> 611.48
I don't really have a a

608.36 --> 614.72
subject to to talk

611.48 --> 614.72
about in

615.9 --> 619.0
[Music]

621.04 --> 627.1999999999999
detail CU I'm not like really dwelling

624.12 --> 629.44
on subjects currently I mostly like this

627.2 --> 631.6
is part of the reason sometimes I just

629.44 --> 635.8800000000001
don't have any subjects to talk about

631.6 --> 639.839
because it's like I'm dwelling on really

635.88 --> 639.8389999999999
personal experiences and

640.399 --> 643.399
things

645.839 --> 653.1600000000001
like like my social life and how that

650.2 --> 656.8000000000001
works and rather how it doesn't work and

653.16 --> 659.36
then comparing it to like uh 10 or even

656.8 --> 661.399
20 years ago

659.36 --> 664.9590000000001
realizing that really nothing has

661.399 --> 667.88
changed all that much in that

664.959 --> 670.5189999999999
sense so I would love to make an excuse

667.88 --> 672.8
like yeah well oh I became a flat

670.519 --> 675.76
earther and suddenly I don't have a

672.8 --> 679.56
social life but I mean to be fair I

675.76 --> 679.56
never really had much of a social

682.8 --> 689.0
life and sometimes I dwell on that a

685.76 --> 689.0
little bit

691.52 --> 697.6
[Music]

693.32 --> 700.0
I mean I have a social life like through

697.6 --> 704.76
people here that visit my show or the

700.0 --> 704.76
guys here and that's that's really

707.04 --> 713.68
it but living like this for a very long

710.12 --> 718.12
time now I do notice that I am kind of

713.68 --> 720.16
like alienating myself more to regular

718.12 --> 721.44
social

720.16 --> 724.68
life out

721.44 --> 728.12
there that I don't really know how to

724.68 --> 731.12
compose myself too much never really did

728.12 --> 734.24
that in the first instance but

731.12 --> 736.76
like 15 and 20 years ago I would at

734.24 --> 739.72
least like have some kind of idea of

736.76 --> 742.079
what I could do and now I just find

739.72 --> 744.48
myself like I don't really

742.079 --> 746.76
know how to

744.48 --> 749.839
engage like with somebody out there

746.76 --> 752.079
other than just superficial banter and

749.839 --> 756.1990000000001
then

752.079 --> 756.199
like and that's enough

757.0 --> 761.92
then right so yeah I'm dwelling on that

760.32 --> 764.399
it's not super

761.92 --> 767.199
interesting it's not like oh that's

764.399 --> 770.959
esoteric Ry well no not really it's just

767.199 --> 770.959
the awkward social life of an

773.72 --> 776.82
[Music]

776.92 --> 782.8389999999999
Arwin and it's not like I'm just

780.0 --> 785.279
a completely socially stunted person

782.839 --> 788.12
like once the connection is there like

785.279 --> 790.0
everything like always goes

788.12 --> 793.399
automatically and that's really what

790.0 --> 793.399
I've always leaned

795.24 --> 802.279
upon I'm just not a guy that like easily

798.959 --> 804.92
just rolls into a social life with

802.279 --> 807.8
somebody that I just meet and then just

804.92 --> 810.56
like stay connected and everything no

807.8 --> 815.16
I'm a hermit basically

810.56 --> 818.16
basically but once the connection is

815.16 --> 822.399
there then like everything goes

818.16 --> 822.399
automatically it really does always

824.639 --> 830.5600000000001
has so it's not like I'm this super shy

828.76 --> 833.3199999999999
guy or something that just like no

830.56 --> 835.079
matter what like like closes off and

833.32 --> 841.0400000000001
then doesn't know how to talk no I'm not

835.079 --> 841.04
like that at all it's rather that like

842.24 --> 848.199
hm could I could like people seem to

845.759 --> 851.839
have like this subconscious incentives

848.199 --> 854.959
of like huh I'm interested in me Arwin

851.839 --> 857.32
or something in some way and then I kind

854.959 --> 860.079
of just read them and then from how I

857.32 --> 862.24
read them like I already get all these

860.079 --> 865.8389999999999
fores

862.24 --> 869.48
sites and I basically get to read it

865.839 --> 871.9590000000001
like they're interested now but can

869.48 --> 874.0790000000001
already assess that after they actually

871.959 --> 876.4799999999999
get to know me there's going to be

874.079 --> 878.959
trouble and they

876.48 --> 881.04
probably like there's like this first

878.959 --> 883.88
appeal to me and it might have something

881.04 --> 885.8
to do with my appearance and everything

883.88 --> 888.56
but I mean yeah it sounds kind of weird

885.8 --> 891.199
but when people get to know me often a

888.56 --> 893.8389999999999
lot of that flare just kind of goes away

891.199 --> 897.12
and they just realize that I'm also kind

893.839 --> 901.12
of there's annoying traits I have that I

897.12 --> 903.92
do work on but that the nuisance of it

901.12 --> 903.92
is still

906.519 --> 913.88
there and that's why I'm not super

909.88 --> 918.36
enthusiastic enthusiastic to have people

913.88 --> 918.36
get to know me all that well out

921.36 --> 930.279
there it requires a certain internal

925.48 --> 930.279
personal chemistry for somebody

931.759 --> 937.279
for me

933.48 --> 940.88
to size it up as in like this can be

937.279 --> 943.4399999999999
like a durable social

940.88 --> 945.56
contact cuz a lot of people like yeah

943.44 --> 947.639
they have superficial interests and this

945.56 --> 951.5999999999999
usually has to do with my appearance I

947.639 --> 953.759
guess but then like that's not a durable

951.6 --> 956.88
interest and

953.759 --> 959.759
then if i' get to know them like if I'd

956.88 --> 962.0
open up and actually get to then contact

959.759 --> 964.639
them like yeah that would be nice for a

962.0 --> 967.959
moment and then they suddenly would get

964.639 --> 972.279
bored with me or like annoyed and then

967.959 --> 975.0
I'd be like having open up realize oh

972.279 --> 976.639
somebody thinks I suck again and they're

975.0 --> 978.8
like trying to get rid of me and then I

976.639 --> 982.16
feel really [ __ ]

978.8 --> 984.639
devastated because I rarely open up to

982.16 --> 986.48
anybody anyway like that and that's part

984.639 --> 989.5600000000001
of the reason that I'm not super

986.48 --> 993.279
enthusiastic to engage with new people

989.56 --> 993.279
out there in the physical

997.72 --> 1004.48
world right so I Ponder upon that sort

1000.639 --> 1007.72
of thing too I guess it comes with the

1004.48 --> 1009.6
loneliness that I do experience but yeah

1007.72 --> 1013.6
it's not super

1009.6 --> 1013.6
interesting dude

1029.0 --> 1034.439
did you just on the spot change your

1032.919 --> 1038.5590000000002
name

1034.439 --> 1038.559
teret I know it's you

1043.16 --> 1050.8400000000001
now sick

1045.24 --> 1050.84
bastard anyway low borders boy

1059.559 --> 1064.32
breaking into friendship groups and

1061.48 --> 1064.32
middleages

1065.32 --> 1071.8799999999999
stuff well I'm not even talking about

1068.32 --> 1074.48
groups like I don't even I'm not even

1071.88 --> 1077.7600000000002
interested in groups I'm just interested

1074.48 --> 1077.76
in individuals

1081.24 --> 1086.08
people you have before 30 you have for

1083.48 --> 1089.84
Life yeah well all those friends that I

1086.08 --> 1091.52
had before that they're all gone I

1089.84 --> 1093.72
didn't have too many friends there

1091.52 --> 1097.6
anyway but they were like kind of social

1093.72 --> 1101.76
justice Warrior types

1097.6 --> 1101.76
so that I had peace

1107.559 --> 1112.1589999999999
with and then I got into Flat Earth and

1110.32 --> 1116.28
they just

1112.159 --> 1116.2800000000002
like became hostile

1119.48 --> 1126.64
almost but also there were like issues

1122.799 --> 1130.52
like there's been always issues with me

1126.64 --> 1134.5590000000002
and social life people and that is that

1130.52 --> 1137.559
people end up like not treating me with

1134.559 --> 1137.559
respect

1139.159 --> 1144.5200000000002
and maybe that's something that just the

1141.52 --> 1148.2
way that I am it kind of like invites

1144.52 --> 1148.2
that but not on

1150.72 --> 1157.799
purpose it's because of my low

1154.2 --> 1161.32
self-esteem that I view myself with

1157.799 --> 1164.32
people tend to unfortunately take that

1161.32 --> 1164.32
over

1169.919 --> 1173.039
like I downplay

1173.76 --> 1180.36
myself like with some kind of level of

1176.799 --> 1183.6
fear and then people like just see me

1180.36 --> 1185.52
like that and that like ruins

1183.6 --> 1188.8799999999999
everything

1185.52 --> 1191.0
continually right and I don't want that

1188.88 --> 1194.0
to happen and I

1191.0 --> 1196.28
mean it's complicated to deal with the

1194.0 --> 1198.84
social dynamics of

1196.28 --> 1202.799
that you have to just be really

1198.84 --> 1206.12
comfortable like despite your

1202.799 --> 1208.44
feelings so in that sense I'd have to

1206.12 --> 1212.08
literally suppress my feelings and then

1208.44 --> 1212.0800000000002
almost be like socially

1214.2 --> 1219.3600000000001
ambitious and that way I can prevent

1216.84 --> 1224.24
people from treating me like

1219.36 --> 1228.799
[ __ ] and yeah I I man I did not manage

1224.24 --> 1231.88
to pull that off when I mingled with fed

1228.799 --> 1235.84
I moved in

1231.88 --> 1238.64
with with those issues and well you all

1235.84 --> 1240.6399999999999
know what happened after that

1238.64 --> 1243.2
point

1240.64 --> 1246.76
right people just start to treat me like

1243.2 --> 1251.52
[ __ ] when the tensions are high it's

1246.76 --> 1251.52
like yeah that's what

1253.2 --> 1260.6000000000001
happens but it is because of

1256.12 --> 1260.6
composure from my side

1261.24 --> 1268.76
and yeah I just have to be more socially

1265.36 --> 1271.3999999999999
ambitious in the early phases and like

1268.76 --> 1273.279
stick up for myself and have like a

1271.4 --> 1278.2
different angle of approach

1273.279 --> 1280.48
socially hey h debatable D seems to

1278.2 --> 1283.48
finally figured out a way to get on

1280.48 --> 1283.48
Skype

1295.559 --> 1301.08
you got to be your oh my God zap tappy I

1298.559 --> 1304.1589999999999
heard that [ __ ]

1301.08 --> 1307.6
[ __ ] forever you're just going to be

1304.159 --> 1310.88
yourself Oh you mean you just got to be

1307.6 --> 1313.12
impulsive Let Yourself Go and like

1310.88 --> 1316.24
whatever impulse that's going to be

1313.12 --> 1319.1589999999999
there just show it so that it can

1316.24 --> 1322.32
manifest and root itself and live

1319.159 --> 1325.279
ruin the entire social relationship from

1322.32 --> 1327.76
that point on yeah yeah that that thing

1325.279 --> 1330.64
about just be yourself yeah that doesn't

1327.76 --> 1330.64
[ __ ] work with

1331.08 --> 1336.3999999999999
me if I show too much of myself it will

1334.24 --> 1338.76
literally ruin

1336.4 --> 1341.0800000000002
everything and I am myself I don't need

1338.76 --> 1345.84
to tell myself to be myself I just have

1341.08 --> 1345.84
to like be more myself more

1347.2 --> 1352.559
moderately because people can't handle

1349.88 --> 1355.6000000000001
me as people can't handle the truth not

1352.559 --> 1359.08
that I am the personification of truth

1355.6 --> 1361.6
but in general they can't and I'm very

1359.08 --> 1365.279
truthful with like who I am and very

1361.6 --> 1365.279
direct and they can't handle that

1365.36 --> 1369.84
either and then because they can't

1367.48 --> 1372.24
handle that I start to feel [ __ ] about

1369.84 --> 1375.0
myself downplay myself then they take

1372.24 --> 1378.96
that over as like

1375.0 --> 1381.08
a defensive measure against the

1378.96 --> 1385.279
aspects of me that they can't handle

1381.08 --> 1385.279
when I'm too much myself so

1389.64 --> 1394.5200000000002
yeah I know it the whole saying like oh

1392.679 --> 1397.44
you're just got to be yourself when

1394.52 --> 1400.84
meeting new people or somebody you're

1397.44 --> 1404.0
interest interested in romantically or

1400.84 --> 1406.52
whatever and that's true like yeah don't

1404.0 --> 1409.0
act like you're something

1406.52 --> 1411.9189999999999
different I I wouldn't even think of

1409.0 --> 1414.6
doing that it's just that with me don't

1411.919 --> 1414.6000000000001
be too

1418.159 --> 1423.64
much don't beat yourself too much also

1421.72 --> 1425.52
because there might be some people out

1423.64 --> 1429.1200000000001
there that might be able to handle that

1425.52 --> 1431.76
but if they can handle

1429.12 --> 1433.9189999999999
yourself in full intensity there's a

1431.76 --> 1437.44
great likelihood that they can handle

1433.919 --> 1439.76
that because they themselves have a very

1437.44 --> 1442.559
intense side to that them that they then

1439.76 --> 1445.559
automatically will feel inclined to show

1442.559 --> 1447.279
that side too and basically burden you

1445.559 --> 1450.32
with that because a lot of

1447.279 --> 1452.32
people that are intense hold back and

1450.32 --> 1455.6399999999999
then when they get to show themselves

1452.32 --> 1458.3999999999999
they like intuitively instinctually just

1455.64 --> 1461.0800000000002
start to like pile it on you because

1458.4 --> 1464.8400000000001
it's like oh somebody's finally opening

1461.08 --> 1464.84
that door here's all of

1465.279 --> 1471.559
it yeah

1468.559 --> 1472.76
yeah I know I make my social life sound

1471.559 --> 1476.52
very

1472.76 --> 1479.399
complicated cuz it kind of is and that's

1476.52 --> 1479.399
why I'm mostly a

1479.6 --> 1483.6789999999999
Hermit

1481.12 --> 1486.0
anyway so these are the types of things

1483.679 --> 1490.44
that I sometimes dwell upon and I don't

1486.0 --> 1490.44
really think of it as interesting

1492.159 --> 1496.72
material to talk about

1500.799 --> 1505.8799999999999
and then I try to find something else

1502.96 --> 1507.72
and then it doesn't really work cuz this

1505.88 --> 1509.2
stuff I was pondering upon that

1507.72 --> 1512.799
yesterday as

1509.2 --> 1515.44
well I just didn't really want to put it

1512.799 --> 1517.9189999999999
down and I didn't have the focus to

1515.44 --> 1519.88
properly put it down it's like these

1517.919 --> 1522.1200000000001
types of things are all about like

1519.88 --> 1525.1200000000001
subconscious feelings and things and

1522.12 --> 1527.7199999999998
like complicated responsing Dynamics in

1525.12 --> 1530.7199999999998
Social reactions and it's very

1527.72 --> 1532.679
complicated to properly explain it in a

1530.72 --> 1534.919
way that people actually understand what

1532.679 --> 1536.799
the hell you're talking about and I just

1534.919 --> 1542.159
didn't have to focus yesterday at all

1536.799 --> 1545.76
now I do I am much more focused it seems

1542.159 --> 1545.7600000000002
right anyway hello

1548.88 --> 1554.2
zy what the hell are you talking about

1559.08 --> 1564.76
great advice oh well you saying that

1562.559 --> 1568.08
that makes it immediately

1564.76 --> 1571.279
suspicious uh

1568.08 --> 1574.1589999999999
Moxy everyone has awkward situations

1571.279 --> 1577.96
yeah but nobody

1574.159 --> 1581.679
cares it's not about I don't try to

1577.96 --> 1581.679
avoid awkwardness

1588.399 --> 1591.279
it's not about

1591.36 --> 1597.4799999999998
that like awkward like almost everybody

1595.24 --> 1597.48
is

1598.08 --> 1604.32
awkward when I interact with

1600.76 --> 1607.08
them because I delve into like a much

1604.32 --> 1609.9189999999999
deeper pattern than most people like

1607.08 --> 1609.9189999999999
even tap

1610.72 --> 1618.799
into CU a lot of people aren't raised

1614.399 --> 1621.76
with lots of depth of personality

1618.799 --> 1623.96
they're raised superficially and so then

1621.76 --> 1627.0
they don't really know how to deal with

1623.96 --> 1630.8400000000001
somebody that has been raised with great

1627.0 --> 1632.96
depth of Personality like I have where

1630.84 --> 1635.8799999999999
very early on in my life I was very

1632.96 --> 1635.88
focused on my own

1637.159 --> 1642.279
psyche yeah most people

1639.88 --> 1644.159
don't because their parents just don't

1642.279 --> 1645.72
know what the [ __ ] to do with that they

1644.159 --> 1647.64
don't know how to respond and then it

1645.72 --> 1648.96
never happens and it's just always like

1647.64 --> 1653.1200000000001
uh

1648.96 --> 1653.1200000000001
whatever just talk to your friends or

1653.44 --> 1658.279
something they have to be lucky enough

1655.88 --> 1660.7990000000002
to find a friend that would actually do

1658.279 --> 1664.0
that at a young age because that's kind

1660.799 --> 1664.0
of rare

1693.399 --> 1697.0
what anyway hello

1698.88 --> 1703.7990000000002
dupons

1700.399 --> 1703.799
cism what the

1706.519 --> 1710.519
hell what the hell does that that even

1715.399 --> 1720.1589999999999
mean you mean certain people's

1720.48 --> 1725.32
friends to change your

1723.559 --> 1729.76
personality

1725.32 --> 1731.48
well only if your personality is so out

1729.76 --> 1733.84
of whack that people just don't know

1731.48 --> 1735.799
what to do with that at all yeah then

1733.84 --> 1738.4399999999998
you'd have to change your

1735.799 --> 1740.6399999999999
personality you might have such issu do

1738.44 --> 1744.039
Rons because you're kind of

1740.64 --> 1747.5590000000002
weird and that's that's an rwin saying

1744.039 --> 1747.559
that and I am kind of

1751.159 --> 1755.279
weird but yeah as clutch

1758.039 --> 1763.6
says if people like completely reject

1761.12 --> 1763.6
you

1764.2 --> 1769.32
then I mean you might just like hang

1767.44 --> 1772.3600000000001
with them because of the comfort in

1769.32 --> 1774.32
numbers or something but I mean if you

1772.36 --> 1777.24
can't be yourself you won't be able to

1774.32 --> 1779.6789999999999
rely upon those friends too much for

1777.24 --> 1782.32
anything other than them being there and

1779.679 --> 1785.3200000000002
you being able to hang around with them

1782.32 --> 1785.32
so

1798.64 --> 1803.44
there's AIT for every po well zap teppy

1801.399 --> 1805.12
that's a nice saying but that actually

1803.44 --> 1810.3600000000001
applies to

1805.12 --> 1810.36
relationships and not to like friends

1819.04 --> 1822.1299999999999
[Music]

1835.06 --> 1839.529
[Music]

1843.22 --> 1846.44
[Music]

1854.84 --> 1859.12
hey Richard G good to see you

1868.72 --> 1873.84
right but I

1870.6 --> 1876.279
mean there are like a couple of girls

1873.84 --> 1878.639
that I kind of like get to know at a

1876.279 --> 1881.559
distance and I do feel they're

1878.639 --> 1883.32
interested it's just that I'm just

1881.559 --> 1885.639
really afraid that I'm going to just

1883.32 --> 1888.24
like ruin their smile

1885.639 --> 1892.039
basically cuz I'm just really happy that

1888.24 --> 1896.24
they smile at me when I bump into

1892.039 --> 1898.36
them and like I'm so happy with that

1896.24 --> 1900.799
that they just smile that there is a

1898.36 --> 1903.1999999999998
chemistry that I'm like afraid that if I

1900.799 --> 1907.039
engage that I would ruin

1903.2 --> 1907.039
that that's also a

1910.08 --> 1917.0
thing cuz just

1913.679 --> 1919.5590000000002
people women being out there and like

1917.0 --> 1922.88
just liking me at a distance is like

1919.559 --> 1926.72
really precious to me in a way

1922.88 --> 1929.44
like it really charges me up in a very

1926.72 --> 1932.88
positive way like it's super good for my

1929.44 --> 1934.919
self-esteem and I'm like if I really

1932.88 --> 1937.44
like try to connect up with them I could

1934.919 --> 1940.039
potentially ruin that and I'd be

1937.44 --> 1943.44
mortified if that would

1940.039 --> 1945.72
happen it's like I'm just afraid that if

1943.44 --> 1949.6000000000001
they got to know me that they' like not

1945.72 --> 1949.6000000000001
feel the same anymore

1973.72 --> 1977.76
anyway hey akumu virus

1997.32 --> 2003.08
all right but as as to like actual

1999.639 --> 2005.559
friendships even with women it's always

2003.08 --> 2008.72
going to be a yapping relationship and

2005.559 --> 2009.96
if certain girls are just not into that

2008.72 --> 2013.1200000000001
then it's like how am I going to

2009.96 --> 2015.6000000000001
maintain a friendship when I just

2013.12 --> 2018.399
continually would be wanting to make

2015.6 --> 2020.039
them understand things that are kind of

2018.399 --> 2021.6
complicated and that they probably

2020.039 --> 2024.919
wouldn't be able to follow and like

2021.6 --> 2024.9189999999999
that's going to run into a dead

2027.519 --> 2034.6
end right anyway I am like just there's

2032.159 --> 2039.72
a name for that that

2034.6 --> 2039.7199999999998
behavior I'm just downplaying it

2050.32 --> 2055.32
they like gossiping oh yeah actual

2052.599 --> 2055.32
gossiping is

2061.44 --> 2067.48
terrible I mean gossiping some type of

2064.48 --> 2070.56
gossiping can be kind of you can have

2067.48 --> 2072.44
like funny gossiping where people are

2070.56 --> 2076.839
just like gossiping and then like making

2072.44 --> 2079.359
a funny story out of it like making

2076.839 --> 2082.0
somebody Silly and I mean like that's

2079.359 --> 2085.52
that's okay I guess but when it's like

2082.0 --> 2088.159
really like gossiping that results in

2085.52 --> 2090.839
somebody being put down on the social

2088.159 --> 2093.399
ladder like

2090.839 --> 2096.2
you're you're putting them down with the

2093.399 --> 2098.839
gossip underneath you or something like

2096.2 --> 2101.7599999999998
that's terrible that's always terrible

2098.839 --> 2105.68
and it's usually

2101.76 --> 2105.6800000000003
wrong yeah I don't like that

2112.839 --> 2115.839
either

2116.4 --> 2121.839
anyway here and I take a by to that

2126.64 --> 2130.68
cheers for

2153.36 --> 2156.4190000000003
[Applause]

2192.63 --> 2195.6690000000003
[Music]

2199.64 --> 2204.72
right so yeah I guess that's

2201.88 --> 2207.2400000000002
uh how the show starts talking about

2204.72 --> 2207.24
that sort of

2212.68 --> 2219.3999999999996
thing cuz yeah I dwell upon these types

2215.64 --> 2219.4
of things I just do

2224.599 --> 2228.96
and it's not like I don't want to talk

2227.0 --> 2233.319
about it because it's like oh it's

2228.96 --> 2233.319
private no it's just

2233.48 --> 2238.599
that I feel like it's like

2239.319 --> 2244.839
tedious I feel like I don't want to talk

2242.44 --> 2247.64
about it I just sound I would just sound

2244.839 --> 2250.04
like a lonely guy that's like oh life is

2247.64 --> 2252.96
so hard like I don't want that's not

2250.04 --> 2257.079
what I want to like roll out for you

2252.96 --> 2261.44
guys like even if that is from my

2257.079 --> 2261.44
perspective seemingly true I don't want

2262.68 --> 2268.3999999999996
to I don't want the show to be like that

2288.44 --> 2296.66
[Music]

2308.29 --> 2311.4
[Music]

2328.319 --> 2333.839
I'd be surprised at how many lonely men

2331.2 --> 2338.2799999999997
exist out there no I'm not surprised at

2333.839 --> 2338.2799999999997
all it's an epidemic

2340.119 --> 2344.6400000000003
yeah

2342.24 --> 2347.1189999999997
pandemic the real

2344.64 --> 2350.44
pandemic is

2347.119 --> 2352.28
loneliness dude I've been saying that

2350.44 --> 2355.839
for

2352.28 --> 2358.599
years not like all the time but I've

2355.839 --> 2361.72
made that note

2358.599 --> 2367.88
like it's the logical consequence of the

2361.72 --> 2367.8799999999997
internet age and social media right

2368.44 --> 2373.44
social media is supposed to connect

2370.96 --> 2376.839
everybody everywhere but what it has

2373.44 --> 2379.04
effectively done is taken away the

2376.839 --> 2381.24
slightly more

2379.04 --> 2384.8
complicated

2381.24 --> 2387.1189999999997
option of normal social physical

2384.8 --> 2388.92
interaction and having to build up a

2387.119 --> 2391.04
relationship

2388.92 --> 2394.079
like like

2391.04 --> 2395.92
that because it's just so much quicker

2394.079 --> 2398.5600000000004
and

2395.92 --> 2400.2400000000002
easier to do through the internet even

2398.56 --> 2401.359
though that's on another level but

2400.24 --> 2405.4799999999996
because

2401.359 --> 2406.88
then you have like you satisfied through

2405.48 --> 2409.319
internet

2406.88 --> 2412.92
communication you then end up missing

2409.319 --> 2417.44
out on physical social communication

2412.92 --> 2420.119
more and that actually makes you lonely

2417.44 --> 2424.16
because you're not going to

2420.119 --> 2427.8
be physically around other

2424.16 --> 2431.16
people as much

2427.8 --> 2434.6400000000003
yeah and loneliness also comes

2431.16 --> 2436.68
from like a physical Instinct of being

2434.64 --> 2439.5989999999997
in the presence of other

2436.68 --> 2441.0789999999997
people that's a part of it it's not just

2439.599 --> 2443.92
about the

2441.079 --> 2445.6800000000003
communication so it's only logical that

2443.92 --> 2449.28
the more

2445.68 --> 2451.64
developed the Internet age would become

2449.28 --> 2454.3590000000004
and it has

2451.64 --> 2458.44
been and then on top of it the world

2454.359 --> 2460.68
getting crazier and more terrible in way

2458.44 --> 2464.96
psychologically that people

2460.68 --> 2467.8799999999997
would clamp onto their Niche social

2464.96 --> 2471.319
groups more and more on the internet and

2467.88 --> 2473.92
become more isolated and more lonely so

2471.319 --> 2477.599
I am not surprised at

2473.92 --> 2480.04
all how many lonely people exist out

2477.599 --> 2483.3590000000004
there and I guess

2480.04 --> 2486.56
that I am also here

2483.359 --> 2489.359
to to give some pointers with that

2486.56 --> 2493.0789999999997
because hey I've been dealing with

2489.359 --> 2493.0789999999997
loneliness since I was a

2493.68 --> 2500.7999999999997
teenager cuz during my teenages I truly

2497.599 --> 2504.2000000000003
found out like I'm

2500.8 --> 2507.28
awkward I'm weird like I don't just

2504.2 --> 2509.0789999999997
automatically flow in a group I don't

2507.28 --> 2511.599
really

2509.079 --> 2515.3590000000004
know who I

2511.599 --> 2518.28
am in the social Dynamic I always like

2515.359 --> 2519.52
in my mind's eye I'm always always like

2518.28 --> 2523.2000000000003
an

2519.52 --> 2526.64
individual in the face of a group

2523.2 --> 2530.2799999999997
dynamic or in the face of other

2526.64 --> 2530.2799999999997
individuals like I

2531.359 --> 2537.2
can't dissolve into the group

2534.48 --> 2541.96
dynamic because in the past when I have

2537.2 --> 2541.96
done that I would get carried

2543.2 --> 2549.359
away I would lose like my bearings in a

2546.4 --> 2552.96
way and like

2549.359 --> 2554.52
become how do you describe that almost

2552.96 --> 2557.559
like manic

2554.52 --> 2559.8
depressed in my intensity within the

2557.559 --> 2564.2400000000002
group dynamics and do things that are

2559.8 --> 2564.2400000000002
like over Overkill too

2566.16 --> 2571.24
much that you could interpret as like I

2568.76 --> 2573.119
would subconsciously try to desperately

2571.24 --> 2575.319
reain my

2573.119 --> 2577.7200000000003
individuality even though I am locked

2575.319 --> 2580.079
into a group dynamic it's like I can't

2577.72 --> 2582.68
accept just being part of the group

2580.079 --> 2587.0
dynamic I have to be this individual all

2582.68 --> 2589.7599999999998
the time all the freaking time like

2587.0 --> 2593.16
forever and that started at a very young

2589.76 --> 2594.5200000000004
age like because if I just dissolve into

2593.16 --> 2597.8799999999997
a group

2594.52 --> 2600.68
dynamic I would just get carried

2597.88 --> 2603.44
away and almost end up being like a

2600.68 --> 2607.24
robot that just does whatever they are

2603.44 --> 2610.2000000000003
told like whatever they are told I just

2607.24 --> 2612.24
do it almost psychopathically because

2610.2 --> 2615.2799999999997
it's like in a group dynamic I just

2612.24 --> 2619.24
don't work the

2615.28 --> 2622.0
same it's weird group dynamics are

2619.24 --> 2624.7599999999998
dangerous for me and that like that's

2622.0 --> 2629.96
nobody has to tell me that I've seen so

2624.76 --> 2629.96
much proof of that throughout my life

2630.359 --> 2635.2799999999997
especially in my teens and pre-teens

2641.72 --> 2647.72
and while other people have like found

2644.64 --> 2650.48
it very satisfying for them to be part

2647.72 --> 2653.52
of a group dynamic and like oh this is

2650.48 --> 2655.52
how I am in the group and they're like

2653.52 --> 2658.319
they think they like that like I could

2655.52 --> 2661.8
never find a a group

2658.319 --> 2665.119
dynamic that would suit

2661.8 --> 2667.4
me I think theoretically the only type

2665.119 --> 2670.92
of group dynamics that I could actually

2667.4 --> 2674.6800000000003
work with would be for example as a

2670.92 --> 2678.44
father which is a group dynamic

2674.68 --> 2681.96
position like I could be a father

2678.44 --> 2685.119
and sometimes I like even in friend

2681.96 --> 2686.8
groups I would like start to act like

2685.119 --> 2689.44
Father

2686.8 --> 2691.079
Figure and like just try to point out

2689.44 --> 2693.16
things to people like hey maybe you

2691.079 --> 2696.6800000000003
shouldn't do and then they literally

2693.16 --> 2698.44
started rebelling against me like I was

2696.68 --> 2701.16
their father because I was basically

2698.44 --> 2704.599
acting like a father which their real

2701.16 --> 2707.5989999999997
father usually wouldn't be doing or be

2704.599 --> 2710.319
terrible at it and I just take over that

2707.599 --> 2710.319
function it's

2711.04 --> 2717.96
like well that is technically very

2713.8 --> 2717.96
awkward too isn't it like

2725.96 --> 2728.96
yeah

2731.68 --> 2736.8799999999997
anyway a lot of people would think of me

2734.76 --> 2738.7200000000003
like yeah that guy is always meddling

2736.88 --> 2741.96
with you he's kind of patronizing

2738.72 --> 2745.2799999999997
because he won't just let us be us the

2741.96 --> 2749.319
way that we are and like yeah that's

2745.28 --> 2752.92
right cuz I find it

2749.319 --> 2755.16
terrible like there is a side of me that

2752.92 --> 2758.2000000000003
is quite

2755.16 --> 2760.2799999999997
negative that I always have to hold back

2758.2 --> 2761.52
and in that sense it kind of feels like

2760.28 --> 2763.96
I'm a

2761.52 --> 2765.8
Vulcan and it's very interesting like

2763.96 --> 2767.839
going through Star Trek Voyager again

2765.8 --> 2769.559
which there's a lot of attention to like

2767.839 --> 2771.96
Vulcan culture and how they are on the

2769.559 --> 2774.0
inside and that's like in a lot of ways

2771.96 --> 2776.64
I am like that I have a lot of darkness

2774.0 --> 2778.28
in me and there's a lot of things that I

2776.64 --> 2780.96
find very

2778.28 --> 2783.3190000000004
agitating about people even though

2780.96 --> 2785.28
that's common like there's no negative

2783.319 --> 2788.48
intention behind it it's just like the

2785.28 --> 2792.119
lack of control and discipline

2788.48 --> 2795.0
infuriates me so I'm always trying to

2792.119 --> 2796.8
like improve people that I'm close to

2795.0 --> 2800.44
that I would be part of the social group

2796.8 --> 2802.76
I'm always doing that they might

2800.44 --> 2805.079
perceive that as being

2802.76 --> 2807.7200000000003
patronizing but I don't mean to be

2805.079 --> 2810.76
patronizing it's just

2807.72 --> 2812.7599999999998
that I'm just trying to raise people to

2810.76 --> 2814.6800000000003
my own internal

2812.76 --> 2818.5200000000004
level even

2814.68 --> 2821.48
though it's extremely rare that there

2818.52 --> 2824.079
even are people that do that to that

2821.48 --> 2826.559
level

2824.079 --> 2830.8390000000004
themselves and those people that do that

2826.559 --> 2832.88
I would never even need to correct we

2830.839 --> 2834.68
would probably almost have like a

2832.88 --> 2836.88
telepathic Bond

2834.68 --> 2839.0
instantaneous because we would just be

2836.88 --> 2842.0
doing the same thing have the same

2839.0 --> 2842.0
priorities

2853.16 --> 2856.24
trying to improve

2859.839 --> 2866.16
people sounds a strange kind of

2862.119 --> 2868.4
friendship to me it's it's I just it's

2866.16 --> 2872.0789999999997
compulsive bers

2868.4 --> 2875.2400000000002
boy it's just like this obsession with

2872.079 --> 2877.559
education I always want people to work

2875.24 --> 2880.9599999999996
on themselves and improve themselves

2877.559 --> 2884.7200000000003
because that's like a religious

2880.96 --> 2884.7200000000003
Obsession to me

2922.44 --> 2925.2400000000002
want it or

2926.8 --> 2929.8
ask

2933.079 --> 2938.7200000000003
yeah but the problem is that if they

2936.079 --> 2938.7200000000003
don't want

2939.119 --> 2947.359
to then I lose respect for those

2944.24 --> 2950.0
people it's like what you're not

2947.359 --> 2952.04
religiously obsessed with

2950.0 --> 2955.04
self-improvement at all

2952.04 --> 2955.04
times

2960.16 --> 2967.799
well then I just see you as like almost

2964.44 --> 2967.799
like an animal

2978.64 --> 2984.0
right and and that just happens there

2980.76 --> 2986.7200000000003
are people like that and then internally

2984.0 --> 2990.079
I feel of them like you're an animal but

2986.72 --> 2991.68
I mean I I I can't punish you for that

2990.079 --> 2994.119
if I feel like

2991.68 --> 2997.319
that even though I might be right

2994.119 --> 3001.04
because it's not my place to do that but

2997.319 --> 3002.96
I'd always be holding that back then

3001.04 --> 3006.2
yeah there's a lot of things I have to

3002.96 --> 3006.2
hold back all the

3012.119 --> 3018.52
time cuz if I didn't i' just literally

3015.96 --> 3021.52
like get to somebody's psyche I'd

3018.52 --> 3026.04
basically like enter their mind with

3021.52 --> 3028.119
my near telepathy and just like unravel

3026.04 --> 3030.88
them

3028.119 --> 3033.6800000000003
judge them to the point where they would

3030.88 --> 3035.599
have to logically become insulted and

3033.68 --> 3038.16
then

3035.599 --> 3040.96
leave like that's what happens when I

3038.16 --> 3043.16
don't hold back I start to piss off

3040.96 --> 3045.7200000000003
people until they all

3043.16 --> 3047.44
leave that's literally what happens if I

3045.72 --> 3050.359
don't hold

3047.44 --> 3053.2400000000002
back cuz there will be something I will

3050.359 --> 3056.839
find and there I will get on their

3053.24 --> 3056.839
nerves with it

3058.079 --> 3064.799
and they will feel about me like Hey Dad

3062.16 --> 3069.24
mind your own business

3064.799 --> 3069.24
dad and then I will find that

3075.82 --> 3082.2490000000003
[Music]

3084.64 --> 3088.68
unacceptable judging people's bad

3087.0 --> 3091.52
because it really doesn't matter yeah

3088.68 --> 3091.52
except it

3092.319 --> 3099.119
does and judging people isn't bad it's a

3096.079 --> 3102.559
surface it's just

3099.119 --> 3106.6400000000003
that if they don't do anything with

3102.559 --> 3109.2400000000002
it then it may have a negative influence

3106.64 --> 3109.24
on on their

3111.76 --> 3119.96
self-image to get myself judged judge me

3116.72 --> 3123.7599999999998
oh don't judge others unless you want to

3119.96 --> 3126.2
be just well I want to be judged judge

3123.76 --> 3129.8390000000004
me yeah I mean this is not the first

3126.2 --> 3132.7599999999998
time I'm saying that judge me I want to

3129.839 --> 3136.52
be judged I want to be criticized tell

3132.76 --> 3138.96
me tell me if there's something

3136.52 --> 3142.88
wrong tell me if there's something that

3138.96 --> 3147.559
slipped my attention judge me point it

3142.88 --> 3151.48
out judge me yeah

3147.559 --> 3151.48
I don't want to be Jud yeah I want to be

3151.68 --> 3158.359
judged I absolutely want to be judged do

3156.24 --> 3162.799
not

3158.359 --> 3166.04
withhold yeah but don't project your own

3162.799 --> 3168.319
ineptness on me either don't just

3166.04 --> 3170.88
project your [ __ ] onto

3168.319 --> 3174.52
me because I will be able to tell if

3170.88 --> 3174.52
you're just projecting

3193.31 --> 3196.44
[Music]

3199.24 --> 3207.64
I have a [ __ ] fit when you judge us lol

3203.72 --> 3207.64
no you don't judge

3214.92 --> 3219.319
I don't know what the hell you're

3216.04 --> 3223.0
talking about but that's absolute

3219.319 --> 3225.0
[ __ ] when you judge me I don't have

3223.0 --> 3229.96
a [ __ ]

3225.0 --> 3234.04
fit but when you just patronize

3229.96 --> 3238.44
me and just talk [ __ ] about me because

3234.04 --> 3238.44
you didn't like my timing with something

3238.88 --> 3245.6800000000003
yeah that's not

3241.76 --> 3245.6800000000003
judgment that's called acting

3245.799 --> 3251.68
out now actual judgment is like a

3249.0 --> 3254.28
neutral process it's an analytical

3251.68 --> 3258.799
intellectual process yeah when you do

3254.28 --> 3259.7200000000003
that I appreciate it I take note of it I

3258.799 --> 3262.559
accept

3259.72 --> 3265.7599999999998
it but that's not what you do a lot of

3262.559 --> 3265.76
the times

3268.76 --> 3274.3190000000004
I usually just ban people who criticize

3271.88 --> 3274.319
no I

3292.52 --> 3298.24
don't clutch told me I was wrong

3295.28 --> 3301.3590000000004
yesterday and haded 2hour breakdown no I

3298.24 --> 3304.8799999999997
had a 2hour explanation and I didn't ban

3301.359 --> 3307.839
him hey [ __ ] want to project more

3304.88 --> 3310.96
crap onto me

3307.839 --> 3313.96
huh oh I have a [ __ ] fit no no no no

3310.96 --> 3318.88
clutch is still

3313.96 --> 3321.2400000000002
there yeah and I had a explanation and

3318.88 --> 3322.96
on top of that a couple of frustration

3321.24 --> 3326.9599999999996
because of the

3322.96 --> 3326.96
disconnection yeah

3327.76 --> 3332.96
that's not the same thing how many

3330.559 --> 3336.3590000000004
people are in my band list I don't know

3332.96 --> 3339.96
but you could add to that zpp

3336.359 --> 3342.68
tappy you could add to that if you keep

3339.96 --> 3344.88
this [ __ ] up cuz what you're doing now

3342.68 --> 3348.1189999999997
is not criticizing you're just being a

3344.88 --> 3350.96
[ __ ] about it yeah this is not

3348.119 --> 3350.96
constructive

3352.96 --> 3359.88
criticism now when people have attitude

3356.48 --> 3361.599
bad attitude that's not criticism that's

3359.88 --> 3364.92
just bad

3361.599 --> 3368.799
attitude bad attitude from which nothing

3364.92 --> 3368.799
can be learned yeah that's not

3378.0 --> 3384.359
criticism

3380.92 --> 3387.799
yeah Banning people to keep order

3384.359 --> 3391.44
because they're out of line

3387.799 --> 3394.44
and they're going to mess up the

3391.44 --> 3394.44
cohesion

3394.92 --> 3399.44
yeah that has nothing to do what was I

3397.88 --> 3403.88
what I was talking

3399.44 --> 3403.88
about it's not resistance to

3405.359 --> 3412.2
criticism it's security measures to

3409.2 --> 3412.2
undermine

3413.88 --> 3418.2400000000002
people's just social

3427.96 --> 3432.48
manipulations you don't guys you guys

3430.16 --> 3435.0
don't seem to understand what criticism

3432.48 --> 3435.0
actually

3441.359 --> 3449.0389999999998
is oh you're not the only Oh you mean

3444.96 --> 3452.0
you zpp tappy and Moxy and akumu virus

3449.039 --> 3452.0
are all in

3452.16 --> 3456.799
agreeance who could have thought that a

3454.359 --> 3459.68
bunch of anti flat earther [ __ ] hats

3456.799 --> 3462.599
could be in agreeance about their social

3459.68 --> 3465.48
behavior and how you think you're right

3462.599 --> 3467.28
when you're not yeah I know you can

3465.48 --> 3469.76
agree with that with each other yeah

3467.28 --> 3472.76
definitely oh oh clutch yeah don't draw

3469.76 --> 3472.76
clutch into this

3474.039 --> 3478.119
[ __ ] don't know if he's still here

3478.559 --> 3484.3190000000004
but

3480.4 --> 3484.319
no yeah there it's not

3493.27 --> 3499.119
[Music]

3495.119 --> 3499.119
criticism yeah it's about

3503.119 --> 3508.1600000000003
timing no it isn't critic it's not

3505.76 --> 3511.7990000000004
resist distance the criticism it's just

3508.16 --> 3511.799
you being

3512.52 --> 3518.119
disrespectful

3515.119 --> 3518.119
disrespectful

3518.359 --> 3525.0
disruptive yeah that's not criticism

3521.48 --> 3529.68
yeah criticism is pointing something out

3525.0 --> 3529.68
in the hopes that it could be corrected

3533.52 --> 3539.2
yeah there's such a thing as timing it

3536.119 --> 3541.0
it's like somebody is holding a speech

3539.2 --> 3542.5989999999997
right it's like they're getting the full

3541.0 --> 3544.92
attention they're supposed to be doing

3542.599 --> 3546.6800000000003
the speech and then you just start

3544.92 --> 3548.92
yelling in the middle of the speech like

3546.68 --> 3550.9199999999996
you said that word wrong is that

3548.92 --> 3553.92
criticism or is that

3550.92 --> 3553.92
disruption

3557.079 --> 3564.28
yeah now that's disruption

3561.16 --> 3569.2799999999997
criticism has to have the intention not

3564.28 --> 3573.8390000000004
to disrupt or make somebody

3569.28 --> 3577.52
discontinue it's an attempt to help

3573.839 --> 3580.0
correct a mistake that is taking place

3577.52 --> 3583.839
yeah that's different from what you do

3580.0 --> 3583.839
you think I don't know the difference

3590.28 --> 3594.0
[Music]

3591.64 --> 3598.0389999999998
[ __ ] not talking to you clutch by

3594.0 --> 3598.039
the way just for the record

3611.839 --> 3616.48
I can't really sense oh yeah because you

3614.48 --> 3619.2
can tell

3616.48 --> 3623.559
that no I

3619.2 --> 3627.68
can I can sense intent through text chat

3623.559 --> 3627.6800000000003
zap tappy I can

3630.44 --> 3635.4
and I don't assume you all have bad

3635.839 --> 3643.52
intentions I deduce it based on the

3641.119 --> 3645.599
patterns of your

3643.52 --> 3649.839
communication when you have bad

3645.599 --> 3649.839
intentions and when you don't

3656.119 --> 3660.48
always get your intent wrong no I don't

3658.0 --> 3660.48
Akuma

3661.359 --> 3665.799
virus that's

3663.2 --> 3667.8799999999997
nuts if I'd always get your intention

3665.799 --> 3669.28
wrong then you would never be allowed to

3667.88 --> 3673.28
speak

3669.28 --> 3673.28
here ever

3687.85 --> 3690.92
[Music]

3714.319 --> 3720.52
every time I explain it's wrong well

3716.799 --> 3720.52
that's just projection auma

3725.0 --> 3733.079
virus I should probably just ban you for

3728.119 --> 3733.079
that but I don't feel like it

3749.48 --> 3753.96
yeah well akumu virus you can shut the

3752.559 --> 3756.6400000000003
[ __ ] up now or you're going to get a

3753.96 --> 3759.2
24-hour time out

3756.64 --> 3761.7599999999998
so yeah what you're do you guys are

3759.2 --> 3765.1189999999997
doing right now is called a

3761.76 --> 3768.079
pylon and that pisses me off because

3765.119 --> 3768.079
you're literally

3768.16 --> 3773.799
undermining whatever I'm putting down

3770.68 --> 3777.839
here you're just undermining this is not

3773.799 --> 3777.839
criticism it's called sabotage

3778.119 --> 3781.76
yeah you're just saying like I always

3779.64 --> 3783.799
get it wrong oh is that criticism no

3781.76 --> 3786.7990000000004
that's called

3783.799 --> 3786.799
sabotage

3790.48 --> 3794.0
yeah that's not

3797.799 --> 3803.52
criticism

3800.24 --> 3806.5589999999997
yeah there's no positive

3803.52 --> 3809.279
correction that I can attack

3806.559 --> 3811.7200000000003
from a comment like that it's not

3809.279 --> 3816.799
criticism it's called

3811.72 --> 3816.799
sabotage yeah I know the difference

3824.1 --> 3827.23

3897.079 --> 3902.8390000000004
that I think it does kind of universally

3900.2 --> 3902.839
apply I

3907.119 --> 3911.1600000000003
mean you might be right it might be

3909.44 --> 3914.64
about the soul but it could be about

3911.16 --> 3918.8799999999997
anything it's like judge anything and

3914.64 --> 3922.4
then that thing on that level will be

3918.88 --> 3925.2000000000003
judged by by others onto you I mean it

3922.4 --> 3927.1600000000003
does make sense oh you don't oh yeah you

3925.2 --> 3931.5589999999997

yeah right

4136.88 --> 4143.64
yeah so do I and I get really pissed off

4140.359 --> 4145.719
when I do sense that they're

4143.64 --> 4148.759
lying as

4145.719 --> 4149.679
well and then I point it out and that's

4148.759 --> 4152.799
my

4149.679 --> 4155.279
judgment and then they say oh you get

4152.799 --> 4158.5199999999995
everything wrong yeah and that's called

4155.279 --> 4160.4800000000005
a [ __ ] lie too and

4158.52 --> 4163.400000000001
projection like that's where you start

4160.48 --> 4165.839
to reverse the world the entire reality

4163.4 --> 4169.4
inside out for your own personal in the

4165.839 --> 4172.48
moment convenience to soothe your

4169.4 --> 4174.2789999999995
soul because you're wrong and you're

4172.48 --> 4176.2789999999995
wrong about a whole bunch of things and

4174.279 --> 4178.679
I'm pointing that out by saying that and

4176.279 --> 4183.2390000000005
so you have to reverse the entire world

4178.679 --> 4186.2390000000005
you say no you get everything wrong no

4183.239 --> 4189.718999999999
no you get everything wrong and you're

4186.239 --> 4192.759
lying to yourself in that moment yeah

4189.719 --> 4197.32
and that pisses me

4192.759 --> 4197.32
off that's my judgment

4203.08 --> 4207.51
not talking to you would work gny bear

4205.12 --> 4210.729
but you got that I

4207.51 --> 4210.729
[Music]

4211.719 --> 4218.0
think yeah I take

4214.199 --> 4221.678999999999
criticism when it's actually meant as

4218.0 --> 4225.48
criticism I don't take mockery and I

4221.679 --> 4225.4800000000005
don't take lip

4226.52 --> 4232.679
and I don't take just like troll

4229.84 --> 4236.12
comments because you feel cranked

4232.679 --> 4239.28
somehow yeah if you're

4236.12 --> 4241.8
responding because of your emotions

4239.28 --> 4241.8
that's not

4245.44 --> 4254.28
criticism criticism is intellectual is

4249.76 --> 4254.280000000001
neutral is an analysis

4270.04 --> 4273.44
yeah what work you get

4273.8 --> 4279.4400000000005
it yeah now we get into like this

4277.199 --> 4281.799999999999
endless

4279.44 --> 4284.759999999999
regress fallacy

4281.8 --> 4286.96
projection vicious circle and I'm not

4284.76 --> 4288.679
going to go there and I mean if akumo

4286.96 --> 4291.52
keeps that up I'm just going to Time Out

4288.679 --> 4294.28
24 hours and can [ __ ]

4291.52 --> 4297.96
off yeah I'm not going to deal with your

4294.28 --> 4297.96
delusional inward

4303.28 --> 4310.599999999999
spiraling and your endless endless

4307.04 --> 4314.6
[ __ ] denial about everything yeah I'm

4310.6 --> 4317.1990000000005
I'm so sick of your endless denial about

4314.6 --> 4320.6
everything that is discussed akumu virus

4317.199 --> 4325.48
it's such a [ __ ] Bard response we're

4320.6 --> 4328.8
sick of it yeah we don't respect you for

[ __ ] being in denial about everything

4328.8 --> 4334.4800000000005
you got it might be a very convenient

4331.639 --> 4339.92
psychological self- protection mechanism

4334.48 --> 4339.919999999999
it sucks though and we hate it

4359.76 --> 4363.76
probably missed the com yeah no no I

4361.679 --> 4365.84
don't even need to know what the [ __ ]

4363.76 --> 4368.280000000001
we're supposedly talking about anymore I

4365.84 --> 4369.84
could just see exactly from the timing

4368.28 --> 4373.199
and what you're saying and how you're

4369.84 --> 4376.76
saying it exactly what it is you always

4373.199 --> 4376.759999999999
do this [ __ ]

4380.0 --> 4385.92
especially when there's

4382.48 --> 4388.919999999999
some Flat Earth versus Globe situation

4385.92 --> 4388.92
happening

4407.04 --> 4410.14

4431.28 --> 4437.28
comment that you're going to put in my

4433.28 --> 4440.28
chat in which you're going to deny

4437.28 --> 4440.28
something

4458.239 --> 4464.199
sure oh you didn't know about the word

4460.76 --> 4467.04
sofry clutch yeah sofry is like a

4464.199 --> 4467.04
tapestry of

4475.84 --> 4481.719
information like but it doesn't really

4478.159 --> 4481.719
amount to anything

4508.38 --> 4511.96
[Music]

4509.8 --> 4515.719
yeah now there's no more there's no

4511.96 --> 4519.6
point we just need to let akumu virus

4515.719 --> 4522.76
just ramble Rumble it

4519.6 --> 4525.639
off like like a stuttering muttering

4522.76 --> 4529.08
freak in the corner just don't don't

4525.639 --> 4530.56
talk to him anymore for a while until

4529.08 --> 4535.6
the ramble

4530.56 --> 4539.04
ends to his Insanity fit runs out

4535.6 --> 4542.88
because he will do everything everything

4539.04 --> 4544.44
to deny everything that is said to this

4542.88 --> 4547.56
point

4544.44 --> 4552.599999999999
yeah everything everything we said he

4547.56 --> 4552.6
will deny every single thing

4557.98 --> 4561.099999999999
[Music]

4573.56 --> 4580.080000000001
right it's not even about the subject

4575.56 --> 4580.080000000001
anymore it's just about

4580.239 --> 4587.638999999999
that the negation of any judgment

4585.48 --> 4590.199
even if it's

4587.639 --> 4594.0
right right because it's not about

4590.199 --> 4597.32
whether it's right or wrong correct or

4594.0 --> 4597.32
incorrect it's

4597.639 --> 4602.159000000001
about the interaction and he doesn't

4600.32 --> 4604.84
want the interaction he doesn't want to

4602.159 --> 4604.839999999999
be

4607.0 --> 4612.639
corrected he doesn't accept correction

4609.84 --> 4615.679
and so he will just keep on barfing out

4612.639 --> 4620.4400000000005
sofry until everybody gets

4615.679 --> 4623.12
too tired to even respond back that's

4620.44 --> 4626.159
why I said just leave him rambling like

4623.12 --> 4628.599999999999
a [ __ ] freak until he's done because

4626.159 --> 4632.08
everything you're going to tell him is

4628.6 --> 4634.400000000001
just going to result in him doing that

4632.08 --> 4637.92
longer

4634.4 --> 4640.159
contining the inward spiral of denial

4637.92 --> 4642.28
about everything that's the only thing

4640.159 --> 4646.0
that will happen if you respond to him

4642.28 --> 4647.88
right now just let him Ram whatever the

4646.0 --> 4650.4
[ __ ] he wants to say whatever the [ __ ]

4647.88 --> 4655.96
he wants to deny and don't respond to it

4650.4 --> 4655.96
cuz he will never stop ever if you

4658.56 --> 4666.31
[Music]

4666.8 --> 4672.0
continue cuz that's what he

4669.04 --> 4674.44
does yeah that's the one thing I know

4672.0 --> 4679.239
about akumu virus in dealing with him

4674.44 --> 4679.239
for like half a decade that's what he

4681.32 --> 4687.92
does yeah you'll just deny everything

4686.0 --> 4691.239
like even the little things even when

4687.92 --> 4694.36
it's inconsequential you'll still deny

4691.239 --> 4696.879999999999
it CU it's very simple from his

4694.36 --> 4699.5599999999995
perspective everything you say that's

4696.88 --> 4703.96
directed towards him is wrong always

4699.56 --> 4703.96
everything is wrong that you say

4705.639 --> 4709.4800000000005
cuz he's in that perspective right

4711.08 --> 4719.12
now yeah this is his defensive

4715.6 --> 4721.08
mechanism stop connecting stop

4719.12 --> 4724.44
communicating stop

4721.08 --> 4728.0
responding and stop judging because from

4724.44 --> 4729.799999999999
his vantage point it's always wrong now

4728.0 --> 4733.96
whatever you're going to say he's going

4729.8 --> 4736.08
to deny it so just stop it leave him

4733.96 --> 4740.0
ramble It Off like a [ __ ] freak in

4736.08 --> 4740.0
the corner don't

4747.56 --> 4752.52
respond you stay out of it Moxy

4776.4 --> 4782.839999999999
right so I don't know why the [ __ ] this

4779.4 --> 4785.879999999999
had to become about these

4782.84 --> 4788.32
[ __ ] was talking about

4785.88 --> 4790.96
psychology my inner psychology I didn't

4788.32 --> 4794.08
want this to become about bunch of

4790.96 --> 4795.4800000000005
Ballard [ __ ] wits and their endless

4794.08 --> 4797.639
denials

4795.48 --> 4800.28
spiraling that's not what I wanted this

4797.639 --> 4800.28
show to be

4802.4 --> 4807.759999999999
about and woodworking guny bear I'd like

4805.04 --> 4812.56
to request that you discontinue this

4807.76 --> 4815.08
inquiry now cuz you're literally

4812.56 --> 4816.04
amplifying the thing that I told you not

4815.08 --> 4820.08
to

4816.04 --> 4822.719
do because of the profile of behavior

4820.08 --> 4825.32
that I predicted would happen which is

4822.719 --> 4829.6
going to happen and is happening right

4825.32 --> 4829.599999999999
now because you're not discontinuing

4835.52 --> 4838.619000000001
[Music]

4922.28 --> 4928.44
welcome if you're just being belligerent

4925.52 --> 4931.1990000000005
however that's not criticism that's just

4928.44 --> 4933.879999999999
being disruptive and then I will kick

4931.199 --> 4936.199
you out for that yeah and that's not

4933.88 --> 4939.0
because I don't take criticism that's

4936.199 --> 4942.0
because you're being belligerent and not

4939.0 --> 4942.0
constructive

4962.32 --> 4969.159

so no need

5313.239 --> 5316.239
right

5341.28 --> 5347.92
need to get a live is that a job I don't

5343.8 --> 5352.76
know maybe this is their job but uh yeah

5347.92 --> 5355.639
B Smithers like whatever man you could

5352.76 --> 5358.6
just email me and just ask me like hey

5355.639 --> 5361.88
uh I'm not a troll

5358.6 --> 5365.0
really but I mean if this is oh you

5361.88 --> 5367.52
can't sense a thing well I already

5365.0 --> 5370.4
sense that like one of the first things

5367.52 --> 5374.4800000000005
I remember you even doing is whining

5370.4 --> 5377.119
about suppos the Sandy Hook and all

5374.48 --> 5381.5199999999995
that uh that's not a great way to start

5377.119 --> 5381.5199999999995
out a conversation

5386.04 --> 5393.96
here and you don't have a right to be

5389.239 --> 5393.959999999999
here especially with sock accounts

5440.92 --> 5447.6
but yeah I mean you can't tell whether I

5443.8 --> 5450.92
can sense anything or not and but uh

5447.6 --> 5454.52
yeah I can but my senses can

5450.92 --> 5458.0
get scattered though

5454.52 --> 5458.0
especially by emotional

5458.32 --> 5463.719
influences I feel agitated then often my

5461.76 --> 5467.88
senses can get things

5463.719 --> 5467.88
wrong it's basically getting

5482.92 --> 5485.92
distracted

5512.84 --> 5516.88
for for

5560.04 --> 5563.6
don't judge yourself

5563.88 --> 5572.52
what what do you mean don't judge

5567.48 --> 5575.36
myself that's just anal it's just an

5572.52 --> 5579.8
analysis yeah I I can get my sensores

5575.36 --> 5579.799999999999
wrong and I'm just like justifying

5581.199 --> 5587.44
it like with burn Smithers I just

5584.4 --> 5592.119
unblocked him by the way if he even

5587.44 --> 5594.919999999999
cares but I mean you're a strange

5592.119 --> 5598.199
figure and if somebody just tells me

5594.92 --> 5600.28
like hey he's actually a troll well

5598.199 --> 5602.678999999999
because of the past behaviors I'm kind

5600.28 --> 5604.5199999999995
of inclined to believe that in a moment

5602.679 --> 5607.719
especially when a whole whole bunch of

5604.52 --> 5611.159000000001
like undercover trolls are all over the

5607.719 --> 5611.159
place turns

5611.8 --> 5619.400000000001
out yeah and then I uh become not so

5616.4 --> 5619.4
trusting

5636.32 --> 5639.32
that

5693.96 --> 5696.96
now

5723.92 --> 5726.92
e

5731.89 --> 5734.959000000001
[Music]

5754.09 --> 5757.1990000000005

5760.39 --> 5765.410000000001
[Music]

5762.32 --> 5765.41
[Applause]

5780.76 --> 5783.76
h

5793.639 --> 5796.159000000001
right

5796.8 --> 5802.28
anyhow been going one and a half hour

5799.199 --> 5805.599999999999
already hope everybody's entertained or

5802.28 --> 5805.599999999999
interested maybe a

5808.04 --> 5814.119
bit maybe it's not super entertaining I

5810.8 --> 5814.119000000001
don't know

5826.199 --> 5831.638999999999
they've been banned while having a

5828.239 --> 5834.959999999999
conversation here yeah well hey if

5831.639 --> 5837.400000000001
you want to that to stop happening stop

5834.96 --> 5839.88
making sock accounts and then just like

5837.4 --> 5844.36
communicate with me over email and let's

5839.88 --> 5846.719
see if I if I can actually like get you

5844.36 --> 5849.799999999999
back yeah if you're going to make sock

5846.719 --> 5852.8
accounts continually then I'm just going

5849.8 --> 5855.88
to assume that you're a troll that's

5852.8 --> 5859.8
trying to force themselves into my chat

5855.88 --> 5863.0
force yourself to become part of my show

5859.8 --> 5863.0
which I find

5867.88 --> 5874.4400000000005
inacceptable yeah some people actually

5871.88 --> 5878.2390000000005
get that

5874.44 --> 5881.4
and then they stop making so accounts

5878.239 --> 5884.159
that immediately get banned all the time

5881.4 --> 5884.159
because they

5884.28 --> 5892.96
actually communicated with me in a

5887.92 --> 5892.96
proper way and then that stops

5895.32 --> 5898.32
happening

5899.08 --> 5904.599
yeah I mean you can be obsessed with

5902.199 --> 5908.678999999999
this show all you like

5904.599 --> 5910.88
you can't force yourself into this chat

5908.679 --> 5914.2390000000005
I mean this is not a [ __ ]

5910.88 --> 5916.88
democracy no Watcher has the right to

5914.239 --> 5919.08
force themselves into this

5916.88 --> 5922.88
show no matter

5919.08 --> 5927.08
what this is my show and I can literally

5922.88 --> 5930.08
ban anybody forever and it's my fullest

5927.08 --> 5930.08
right

5933.56 --> 5938.68
like no matter

5935.59 --> 5938.68

5941.84 --> 5948.400000000001
with

5943.48 --> 5950.678999999999
that well either piss off or just stop

5948.4 --> 5952.4
being such a drone about it and just

5950.679 --> 5955.56
communicate

5952.4 --> 5958.598999999999
properly and then we'll see if you can

5955.56 --> 5960.8
be part of the show right I mean I've

5958.599 --> 5963.8
had conversation with debatable D that

especially about Flat Earth

6141.96 --> 6150.36
or my views on

6145.239 --> 6150.36
things or some subject that I brought up

6152.84 --> 6158.639
before you're just curious okay

6159.679 --> 6165.4800000000005
fine well then express your curiosity in

6162.76 --> 6169.4800000000005
not asking

6165.48 --> 6169.48
questions whatever

6185.4 --> 6191.679
yeah that's an interesting comparison

6187.04 --> 6191.679
wwwh that is a little bit what it's

6192.239 --> 6197.959999999999
like people like that like even before

6195.639 --> 6200.159000000001
the internet there were people that were

6197.96 --> 6200.159
just

6202.119 --> 6207.639
trolls I actually hung around a lot of

6205.04 --> 6211.119
those types of people that had that

6207.639 --> 6215.4400000000005
behavior in retrospect was

6211.119 --> 6218.598999999999
terrible I was not super fond of it that

6215.44 --> 6221.598999999999
they would do that but it would be like

6218.599 --> 6221.599
in a way

6222.4 --> 6227.92
interesting that I was interested in the

6225.44 --> 6231.159
Defiance of that kind of trolling but

6227.92 --> 6233.52
that's like not on the internet type of

6231.159 --> 6235.679
trolling more physical and there would

6233.52 --> 6238.719
always be like risk that you get in a

6235.679 --> 6238.719
fight and that kind of

6239.52 --> 6244.679
thing I was hanging around people like

6242.159 --> 6244.679
that in my

6245.159 --> 6249.119
teens people that were like

6261.28 --> 6265.28
that but my conclus

6263.599 --> 6268.76
really was that it's

6265.28 --> 6271.5199999999995
mostly it comes out of boredom it's like

6268.76 --> 6274.56
those people actually want to be like

6271.52 --> 6277.4400000000005
hunters and they're just like not able

6274.56 --> 6280.679
to fulfill their

6277.44 --> 6283.08
instincts and so they end up doing that

6280.679 --> 6285.599
it's like a a replacement for like a

6283.08 --> 6288.84
challenge like

6285.599 --> 6290.88
hunting and then they do that and I mean

6288.84 --> 6293.04
internet trolling is the worst in that

6290.88 --> 6296.76
sense because that isn't even for

6293.04 --> 6296.76
feeling at all that's not even a real

6301.32 --> 6307.599
challenge I mean that's literally to the

6303.88 --> 6310.1990000000005
level of Golem sitting in a cave fishing

6307.599 --> 6310.1990000000005
it's not a

6319.119 --> 6327.04
challenge but yeah if you're more

6322.119 --> 6329.48
physical trolling that can be a

6327.04 --> 6333.04
challenge right

6329.48 --> 6335.48
because if or when you get caught you do

6333.04 --> 6338.84
risk like physical confrontation it's

6335.48 --> 6338.839999999999
very different from internet

6345.96 --> 6351.84
trolling thanks duper you

6349.44 --> 6356.4
don't I don't think anybody's going to

6351.84 --> 6356.400000000001
turn into a troll like ter it

6399.56 --> 6404.599
you don't think everybody's a trolling

6401.52 --> 6406.4400000000005
that that they get booted here yeah well

6404.599 --> 6408.360000000001
sometimes I just get pissed off with

6406.44 --> 6413.28
them and then I kick them out and then

6408.36 --> 6413.28
usually I unban them the next day

6415.88 --> 6419.159000000001
yeah that's

6423.96 --> 6430.159
it but if there's just people suddenly

6427.28 --> 6432.239
showing up communicating like oh yeah

6430.159 --> 6435.4
they were always there and it's like an

6432.239 --> 6438.638999999999
account that was made today on the day

6435.4 --> 6442.0
itself yeah yeah I'm going to ban

6438.639 --> 6445.28
you like I don't care if you didn't have

6442.0 --> 6447.119
trollish in itions I don't trust that at

6445.28 --> 6449.4
all and you got to have understanding

6447.119 --> 6449.4
for

6450.679 --> 6455.119
that you got to have have the

6453.08 --> 6457.239
realization that there are trolls out

6455.119 --> 6461.759999999999
there that are

6457.239 --> 6463.919999999999
continually trying to rein infiltrate my

6461.76 --> 6467.400000000001
chat

6463.92 --> 6474.2390000000005
continually for over 2

6467.4 --> 6474.239
years continually like every day

6482.36 --> 6486.598999999999
yeah and if you're just like oh [ __ ] but

6484.56 --> 6489.2390000000005
I just made this account because the

6486.599 --> 6494.639
other one got banned by YouTube

6489.239 --> 6497.28
and well if it's that case just email me

6494.639 --> 6500.1990000000005
just send me an email and explain it to

6497.28 --> 6502.119
me and I'll very likely just unban you

6500.199 --> 6504.44
because it's like oh [ __ ] I guess it was

6502.119 --> 6507.679
a misunder standing that's fine I mean

6504.44 --> 6507.678999999999
that's happened plenty of

6521.92 --> 6527.28
times but I mean like my chat in a way

6525.159 --> 6531.159
is just the Wild Wild

6527.28 --> 6536.0
West you can't just walk in here like

6531.159 --> 6538.759999999999
it's some amicable modern era or

6536.0 --> 6541.239
whatever like if you just come walking

6538.76 --> 6544.0
in like you own the place or something

6541.239 --> 6547.638999999999
like you're probably going to get shot

6544.0 --> 6547.639
cuz it's the freaking wild west

6548.32 --> 6555.5599999999995
here see and then you get shitthead

6551.04 --> 6559.8
comments like this some [ __ ]

6555.56 --> 6562.280000000001
[ __ ] like some trolly piece of

6559.8 --> 6563.76
[ __ ] see this is what I have to deal

6562.28 --> 6567.44

6563.76 --> 6569.599
time just giving you a short look just

6567.44 --> 6571.48

6569.599 --> 6573.2390000000005
going to appear on the screen but people

6571.48 --> 6575.959999999999
in the chat right now yeah you can see

6573.239 --> 6579.36

6579.36 --> 6587.5599999999995
[ __ ] scumbag [ __ ] morons show up

6584.0 --> 6589.92
just to share that kind of shitty

6587.56 --> 6592.1990000000005
pointless information that's not

6589.92 --> 6594.2390000000005
information it's not criticism it's just

6592.199 --> 6602.32
them taking making a

6594.239 --> 6602.32
dump cuz they're vicious bitter scumbags

6632.84 --> 6638.360000000001

responds to whenever I ask a question

7102.69 --> 7105.87
[Music]

7112.52 --> 7123.4400000000005
reaction what is a fake reaction fake

7118.719 --> 7126.199
reaction to what why would you say it's

7123.44 --> 7129.32
fake what how is it

7126.199 --> 7132.678999999999
fake like what the [ __ ] is a fake

7129.32 --> 7136.44
reaction supposed to be meaning

7132.679 --> 7138.28
like it's not clear that's why I asked

7136.44 --> 7140.799999999999
that's why I asked in like three

7138.28 --> 7140.8
different

7142.239 --> 7146.598999999999
ways yeah and then telling me like oh

7144.76 --> 7149.679
you don't even know what that means it's

7146.599 --> 7153.639
so obvious yeah why the [ __ ] you think I

7149.679 --> 7157.2390000000005
asked because it's not obvious it's not

7153.639 --> 7157.2390000000005
black and white

7175.719 --> 7184.0
re content is delicious [ __ ] on the

7178.8 --> 7188.1990000000005
tubes I don't even like reaction to

7184.0 --> 7190.719
what you mean like to somebody saying

7188.199 --> 7194.079
something in the comment section and

7190.719 --> 7196.88
then you responded that is that what

7194.079 --> 7201.079
you're talking about is that supposedly

7196.88 --> 7204.4800000000005
the fake reaction like does he write use

7201.079 --> 7208.119
sock accounts to write negative comments

7204.48 --> 7210.718999999999
to himself so he can then fake react on

7208.119 --> 7213.639
his live video to his own sock account

7210.719 --> 7216.599
fake criticizing him is that what you're

7213.639 --> 7219.8
talking about is that why it's fake

7216.599 --> 7222.639
because I have no [ __ ] clue and you

7219.8 --> 7224.28
guys just seem to roll it out like oh oh

7222.639 --> 7226.159000000001
of course you're supposed to understand

7224.28 --> 7228.36
that how can you not understand that

7226.159 --> 7231.119
well because I don't know what the [ __ ]

7228.36 --> 7231.119
you're talking

7238.84 --> 7246.92
about watch somebody else contact and

7242.119 --> 7250.04
overreact to it well there you go so how

7246.92 --> 7253.92
is that supposed to be fake how can you

7250.04 --> 7253.92
fake react to somebody

7255.44 --> 7260.4
I mean is it just oh I'm going to watch

7257.56 --> 7263.1990000000005
something and then just like I like a

7260.4 --> 7265.4
clown have a tamper tantrum that doesn't

7263.199 --> 7268.48
make any damn sense is that what you

7265.4 --> 7268.48
mean with fake

7269.239 --> 7272.239
reaction

7276.599 --> 7282.52
yeah I mean God how difficult is it to

7281.079 --> 7285.5199999999995
just

7282.52 --> 7285.52
describe

7286.28 --> 7290.84
it how difficult is

7301.119 --> 7307.639
this scream when something is not

7305.4 --> 7310.879999999999
scary okay yeah that's

7307.639 --> 7312.4400000000005
gross love when something's not funny

7310.88 --> 7315.1990000000005
well that might be a matter of

7312.44 --> 7317.32
perspective but if if you can hear when

7315.199 --> 7318.4
somebody laughs and they don't actually

7317.32 --> 7321.4
think it's

7318.4 --> 7322.879999999999
funny and that's really gross but I mean

7321.4 --> 7325.879999999999
that falls under

7322.88 --> 7329.36
graveling so are you saying that this

7325.88 --> 7332.76
guy is like giving reaction videos to

7329.36 --> 7335.679
stuff in which he's like graving cuz

7332.76 --> 7338.92
that's [ __ ] gross then I get it like

7335.679 --> 7342.92
see gring a

7338.92 --> 7346.4400000000005
context the context of the entire

7342.92 --> 7350.04
situation yeah I had to literally fish

7346.44 --> 7353.5599999999995
it out of the [ __ ] Pond bottom here

7350.04 --> 7356.639
cuz you guys just seem to be completely

7353.56 --> 7358.92
inept in just trying to describe

7356.639 --> 7362.84
something this pretty

7358.92 --> 7362.84
basic I can't believe

7365.92 --> 7372.599
it I mean how hard can it

7369.639 --> 7375.719
be you have literally have to yell at

7372.599 --> 7378.0
the scream for [ __ ] five minutes just

7375.719 --> 7381.84
to get a proper

7378.0 --> 7384.719
explanation and a proper Insight on what

7381.84 --> 7389.56
the [ __ ] you were talking about why are

7384.719 --> 7389.56
you making a big deal out of it I'm

7390.96 --> 7398.159
inquiring you all speak internet no you

7394.719 --> 7398.159
just suck at

7398.32 --> 7405.679
explaining I mean how difficult is it to

7401.44 --> 7409.839999999999
just must give an answer to a question

7405.679 --> 7409.84
how goddamn difficult can it

7425.92 --> 7435.1990000000005
be I don't play battle toads [ __ ] sake

7432.52 --> 7435.1990000000005
that game

7435.96 --> 7442.079
sucks it's the worst multiplayer

7439.079 --> 7442.079
game

7444.679 --> 7450.679
ever n it isn't the worst but I mean I I

7448.32 --> 7452.36
have played that in the past I was not

7450.679 --> 7454.719
super

7452.36 --> 7457.04
impressed it seemed like it could be

7454.719 --> 7462.04
really cool but it was

7457.04 --> 7462.04
like just buggy

7463.0 --> 7466.679
and unwinable because of

7468.239 --> 7473.0
that so let's not move on suddenly to

7471.719 --> 7476.8
something

7473.0 --> 7476.8
else especially

7477.159 --> 7484.119
that hardest games it's not hardest it's

7480.719 --> 7484.119
[ __ ] impossible

7494.96 --> 7500.719
right so whatever what the [ __ ] is this

7498.0 --> 7503.88
all about man I don't want to talk about

7500.719 --> 7503.88
your stupid computer

7517.199 --> 7526.638999999999
games yeah so I don't do response videos

7521.8 --> 7529.159000000001
I mean I never do that I don't even play

7526.639 --> 7532.1990000000005
videos like yeah you can't really do

7529.159 --> 7535.92
response videos when you don't even play

7532.199 --> 7539.44
videos every time I for some reason play

7535.92 --> 7541.92
a video I always get immediate freaking

7539.44 --> 7544.759999999999
copyright whining from

7541.92 --> 7550.0
YouTube every goddamn

7544.76 --> 7550.0
time so I just don't do that

7553.679 --> 7559.1990000000005
but I'll describe things for

7573.76 --> 7579.8
sure all right in the meantime please

7576.159 --> 7582.28
don't forget to Rogan up the show and if

7579.8 --> 7585.679
you can please support me through the

7582.28 --> 7588.84
PayPal the patreon PayPal specifically

7585.679 --> 7591.719
would be very handy and I can really use

7588.84 --> 7593.4800000000005
the support it's not like I'm getting a

7591.719 --> 7596.44
lot of

7593.48 --> 7598.759999999999
it I mean I do get some support from

7596.44 --> 7598.759999999999
some

7605.119 --> 7610.88
people but I can definitely use a lot

7607.88 --> 7610.88
more

7621.679 --> 7630.96
fake reactions mean what Moxy said okay

7626.76 --> 7634.1990000000005
so playing a video that's not that

7630.96 --> 7637.04
remarkable and then

7634.199 --> 7638.759999999999
overreacting sounds like fake reactions

7637.04 --> 7641.639
actually means like

7638.76 --> 7643.559
overreacting trying to be more

7641.639 --> 7645.4800000000005
expressive or entertaining about

7643.559 --> 7649.76
something than it actually would

7645.48 --> 7649.759999999999
naturally warrant am I

7651.04 --> 7659.119
correct sorry your

7654.4 --> 7659.119
way I'll be right back

7700.44 --> 7704.48
spe for

7760.36 --> 7764.36
yeah e

7805.96 --> 7809.639
okay and I'm back

7824.52 --> 7827.88
right so yeah

7830.199 --> 7834.5199999999995
uh let's see two hours

7834.639 --> 7838.32
in I could move

7840.599 --> 7847.84
on there's any or I could round out the

7843.48 --> 7847.839999999999
show it's all good with me

7880.239 --> 7884.28
h for

7935.92 --> 7939.599
okay this is weird

7966.52 --> 7974.280000000001
I just finding some article

7969.719 --> 7974.28
about WEA modification here in the

7984.239 --> 7991.558999999999
Netherlands basically causing rapid

7987.44 --> 7991.558999999999
evaporation of

7991.599 --> 7995.88
seawat apparently that might be

7993.92 --> 7998.4
happening here in the Netherlands it

7995.88 --> 8001.599
might explain why there's so much rain

7998.4 --> 8001.598999999999
this summer

8001.679 --> 8007.8
that's the link they're laying

8004.719 --> 8009.2390000000005
here so who knows maybe like it's like

8007.8 --> 8011.599
this weather because of weather

8009.239 --> 8014.879999999999
modification not because of

8011.599 --> 8016.559
chemtrailing but because of well the

8014.88 --> 8018.8
same reason as in

8016.559 --> 8021.28
Dubai because there's something just

8018.8 --> 8021.28
like

8022.76 --> 8028.4400000000005
creating

8024.639 --> 8031.719
clouds and rain all the

8028.44 --> 8034.4
time or yeah in that direction that's

8031.719 --> 8034.4
kind of weird and

8037.48 --> 8043.759999999999
freaky because I mean this the weather

8040.119 --> 8043.759999999999
this year is absolutely

8044.96 --> 8050.639
ridiculous it hasn't been this wet and

8047.76 --> 8054.119000000001
cold during the summer around this time

8050.639 --> 8054.119
in like over a

8054.159 --> 8060.239
decade potentially like in 20 years it

8057.96 --> 8062.36
hasn't been this kind of weather like

8060.239 --> 8067.678999999999
this

8062.36 --> 8067.679
moist it does kind of feel unnatural

8095.4 --> 8101.638999999999
that's funny there's some other like UFO

8099.199 --> 8103.0
Specialists or whatever and they're

8101.639 --> 8106.2390000000005
saying that

8103.0 --> 8108.36
there's this could even be like tartaria

8106.239 --> 8111.04
related they're saying that there might

8108.36 --> 8112.96
be a special group of people that are

8111.04 --> 8115.44
like crypto

8112.96 --> 8118.44
earthers that's kind of a funny name for

8115.44 --> 8118.44
it crypto

8119.599 --> 8126.119000000001
earther they're like of Earth but

8122.159 --> 8129.159
they're always in secret crypto Earth or

8126.119 --> 8130.839999999999
so it's like an alternative way to think

8129.159 --> 8134.079
of

8130.84 --> 8137.32
them besides aliens basically assuming

8134.079 --> 8137.32
that they are from this

8137.8 --> 8143.1990000000005
place this is it's kind of interesting

8173.48 --> 8179.159
but yeah they make a point maybe these

8176.04 --> 8182.92
crypto earthers are actually

8179.159 --> 8182.92
the the designer

8183.44 --> 8188.4
of tartarian buildings maybe it's the

8187.0 --> 8191.519
UFO

8188.4 --> 8194.96
people maybe you could call them the

8191.519 --> 8194.960000000001
elves or the

8197.479 --> 8203.279999999999
arens that is an interesting link to

8204.12 --> 8210.0
Lei it's not that super farfetched

8211.8 --> 8215.8
I mean when I talked about it it's like

8213.679 --> 8218.8
yeah maybe they were like the elves

8215.8 --> 8221.639
right it would make sense in many

8218.8 --> 8224.759999999998
ways it's just that in Lord of the Rings

8221.639 --> 8228.438999999998
they never get to making UFO

8224.76 --> 8228.439
Vehicles they just have

8238.719 --> 8244.759999999998
boats but I mean in the Lord of the

8241.359 --> 8248.2
Rings Universe just give it enough time

8244.76 --> 8251.439
like let the dwarves unleash industrial

8248.2 --> 8253.559000000001
revolutions and at some point you know

8251.439 --> 8256.76
the elves would just like Advance their

8253.559 --> 8259.559
own Tech and just like have

8256.76 --> 8264.24
UFOs like of course they

8259.559 --> 8264.24
would only makes sense

8275.88 --> 8278.88
what

8330.599 --> 8333.599
on you talking

8345.639 --> 8352.358999999999
about who's talking about a cat what cat

8349.0 --> 8355.359
are you talking about there is no person

8352.359 --> 8358.2
that has a cat as a

8355.359 --> 8361.559000000001
picture as an icon here what are you

8358.2 --> 8361.559000000001
talking about

8372.479 --> 8379.319
Z tappy has a dog as a picture like why

8375.96 --> 8383.719
are you what like what is this kind of

8379.319 --> 8386.519
like I'm being ironic so I'm going to be

8383.719 --> 8391.479
basically lying and saying reversed

8386.519 --> 8391.479
World [ __ ] like that's [ __ ] funny

8391.8 --> 8395.479
cat dog no it's not cat

8403.6 --> 8410.04
dog oh it's a dog you

8407.08 --> 8413.039999999999
think you didn't even check it you

8410.04 --> 8413.04
dumbass

8422.359 --> 8425.08
ah

8425.12 --> 8430.0
whatever yeah I can't see it from just

8428.16 --> 8432.359
the chat too I have to actually go to

8430.0 --> 8434.0
their Channel maybe that's it you can't

8432.359 --> 8436.359
do that because you don't have a wrench

8434.0 --> 8436.359
so

8438.16 --> 8445.119999999999
whatever shut up akumo

8441.6 --> 8447.479000000001
virus I know cat dog was a

8445.12 --> 8450.479000000001
cartoon and it's not what is in the

8447.479 --> 8450.479
image

8452.359 --> 8456.76
it's not funny auma virus

8486.08 --> 8489.88
taking cat for a walk yeah I've seen

8487.92 --> 8492.92
some people out there in the city like

8489.88 --> 8495.759999999998
taking their cat for a walk it's

8492.92 --> 8497.56
weird but I guess some cats are just

8495.76 --> 8500.399
like that they would accept that I've

8497.56 --> 8501.56
never had a cat that would ever accept

8500.399 --> 8505.16
getting a

8501.56 --> 8507.84
leash they just freaking tear you

8505.16 --> 8510.8
apart but I guess that if you like train

8507.84 --> 8513.880000000001
them at a young age to accept that that

8510.8 --> 8513.88
just become like

8521.479 --> 8526.0
that kitten on his shoulder

8538.399 --> 8542.519999999999
H be on a leash

8548.24 --> 8555.0
what takes four cats on the leash for

8551.359 --> 8558.52
walks Jesus that sounds like it could

8555.0 --> 8558.52
like turn into a complete

8559.12 --> 8567.28
mess I mean seriously just imagine like

8562.399 --> 8570.92
a ter territorial male cat that suddenly

8567.28 --> 8572.84
shows up or jumps out of the bushes and

8570.92 --> 8574.479
like all four of them are just going to

8572.84 --> 8577.479
go

8574.479 --> 8577.479
nuts

8590.8 --> 8595.96
H yeah I bet it it does look kind of

8594.24 --> 8599.279
funny

8595.96 --> 8603.278999999999
though weird I mean it looks really

8599.279 --> 8603.279
alien to me when I see it a cat on the

8603.8 --> 8606.8
leash

8606.84 --> 8611.84
right anyhow I think I'm rounding out

8609.279 --> 8614.92
the show I mean this is just chat's just

8611.84 --> 8619.16
talking about nonsense now I can insert

8614.92 --> 8622.319
all kinds of subjects you guys are just

8619.16 --> 8625.399
completely ignoring it and just talking

8622.319 --> 8628.319
about nonsense so I'm going to round out

8625.399 --> 8632.439
the show cuz I don't like it when I

8628.319 --> 8632.439
actually try to bring up subject

8632.479 --> 8638.8
did you just ignore it and then continue

8634.76 --> 8638.800000000001
to talk about absolute

8638.92 --> 8644.56
nonsense

8640.96 --> 8644.56
so I'm rounding

8656.68 --> 8665.0
out yeah yeah Moxy yeah rounding out

8661.52 --> 8667.560000000001
that's right bringing up subjects no

8665.0 --> 8671.359
response talking about nonsense yeah

8667.56 --> 8674.68
well then the show ends yeah this is not

8671.359 --> 8676.359
your random chat room where nothing

8674.68 --> 8678.279
interesting happens and you can just

8676.359 --> 8681.479000000001
hang around forever that's not what this

8678.279 --> 8681.479000000001
is this is a live

8681.76 --> 8688.08
show it's not getting interesting it's

8684.68 --> 8688.08

8764.359 --> 8770.439
in my chat the entire [ __ ] time don't

8767.88 --> 8772.599999999999

8825.76 --> 8833.2
think my like my mood is not going to be

8829.399 --> 8835.479
ruined too much even though I am like a

8833.2 --> 8838.960000000001
little [ __ ] agitated here with the

8835.479 --> 8842.319
chat it's all ballards and they're all

8838.96 --> 8845.759999999998
talking [ __ ] about [ __ ] cats who

8842.319 --> 8845.76
the [ __ ] gives a
