[Music]

418.52 --> 424.78999999999996
off

421.33 --> 424.78999999999996
[Music]

427.46 --> 430.52
[Music]

432.12 --> 438.039
right on the other hand trolls are about

434.84 --> 440.79999999999995
again I've noticed like

438.039 --> 443.96
another bacterial

440.8 --> 445.68
Bloom they probably it's logical like

443.96 --> 449.0
springtime

445.68 --> 452.039
happens then suddenly they realized how

449.0 --> 454.68
unwanted that they really are in their

452.039 --> 457.56
lives how much trouble they have

454.68 --> 460.479
connecting naturally with people like

457.56 --> 464.44
everybody wants to do in Spring and so

460.479 --> 467.56
they're going to have this Broody angry

464.44 --> 471.12
dissatisfied feeling that they want to

467.56 --> 475.039
conveniently throw onto somebody

471.12 --> 475.039
else so it's all to be

478.44 --> 485.56
expected yeah some people connect up may

483.36 --> 488.319
make new friends get a

485.56 --> 491.479
girlfriend have fun out there and others

488.319 --> 492.879
just reemphasize how [ __ ] miserable

491.479 --> 496.199
they really are in their lives because

492.879 --> 496.199
they're actually really

498.759 --> 504.0
pathetic without any outlook on being

501.879 --> 506.96000000000004
able to change

504.0 --> 508.56
that nor having hope of actually

506.96 --> 512.56
changing that so they're going to then

508.56 --> 515.12
look for Target get to try to push their

512.56 --> 517.7189999999999
misery onto so that they don't have to

515.12 --> 519.5600000000001
feel like it's all them which it

517.719 --> 522.9190000000001
is

519.56 --> 525.3199999999999
right they'll find

522.919 --> 528.3199999999999
camaraderie in that even with other

525.32 --> 530.32
pathetic people that's what they do

528.32 --> 533.2
that's a trolls

530.32 --> 535.44
life it's all over Owen Benjamin's

533.2 --> 538.1600000000001
Rumble chat yesterday again but like

535.44 --> 539.839

538.16 --> 542.8

539.839 --> 542.8000000000001
anything that doesn't

551.12 --> 556.399
work all

off go and do something else you know

590.24 --> 597.72
you could do that or you have do you

593.76 --> 597.72

630.839 --> 633.519
something out of

646.96 --> 653.519
[Music]

650.279 --> 656.279

today is going to be

656.279 --> 664.24
mostly watch like ATV Channel

660.399 --> 667.399

670.079 --> 674.76
outside watch the real

675.44 --> 680.2790000000001

694.36 --> 697.639
you yeah

710.88 --> 716.72
really yeah whatever debatable D yeah

714.079 --> 720.16
there's a lot of stupid YouTube shorts

716.72 --> 723.88
and all kinds of weird stuff happening

720.16 --> 727.24
out there seen all kinds of weird videos

723.88 --> 730.72
like that don't really care though it's

727.24 --> 730.72
not really a subject to bring

746.92 --> 751.16
up hey Richard G good to see you

759.399 --> 763.04
all

760.48 --> 765.44
right but hey if you want to look some

763.04 --> 767.36
you want to watch something that's going

765.44 --> 769.399
to entertain you and be kind of

767.36 --> 774.399
interesting and

769.399 --> 779.32
weird watch Resident alien on

774.399 --> 783.92
Netflix it's a Sci-Fi original series

779.32 --> 783.9200000000001
and it's interesting and

784.76 --> 790.68
hilarious they're basically like a a

787.12 --> 793.92
group of these guys it's a very similar

790.68 --> 796.4799999999999
type of setup amicable setup like

793.92 --> 798.3199999999999
Firefly was where it's really like those

796.48 --> 799.839
group of actors they're all played into

798.32 --> 803.6
one

799.839 --> 806.32
another and it's really funny it's kind

803.6 --> 810.48
of weird and really

806.32 --> 814.6
funny yeah I know Ellen to ditch toic or

810.48 --> 816.32
whatever is how yeah he's great he's

814.6 --> 819.0790000000001
really good at it but like the whole

816.32 --> 819.0790000000001
group is kind of

824.519 --> 831.279
funny so yeah I'm almost through the

827.6 --> 834.16
entire series and I or the season and I

831.279 --> 836.24
definitely recommend it it's very funny

834.16 --> 838.04
it's a bit creepy here and there but

836.24 --> 841.04
it's

838.04 --> 841.04
funny

846.47 --> 851.32
[Music]

848.16 --> 855.639
definitely comedically entertaining and

851.32 --> 855.639
they have some really sharp jokes there

856.079 --> 861.3599999999999
too I liked

858.759 --> 863.44
it wait till I get the season what

861.36 --> 867.8000000000001
there's a season

863.44 --> 871.0400000000001
two okay that didn't show on Netflix

867.8 --> 871.04
maybe it's not on Netflix

872.6 --> 878.36
yet but uh yeah it's been very fun thus

875.6 --> 882.88
far season 3 just started okay well

878.36 --> 882.88
that's probably just the Sci-Fi channel

885.04 --> 894.079
then right so I got all the

889.16 --> 894.079
time but yeah it been it's been very

898.04 --> 903.279
entertaining

900.44 --> 908.36
I really like how he's just

903.279 --> 911.8
like so incredibly direct like Beyond

908.36 --> 915.519
rude incredibly direct I love

911.8 --> 918.56
it like I could only dream to be that

915.519 --> 921.88
direct to people naturally and I am kind

918.56 --> 921.88
of direct to people

924.6 --> 930.88
usually brick

927.959 --> 935.1199999999999
topper

930.88 --> 935.12
but you yeah you thought all kinds of

938.399 --> 944.8
things you obviously completely

941.399 --> 947.44
overgeneralized everything you

944.8 --> 950.279
heard what are are you are you

947.44 --> 952.8800000000001
desperately looking for some

950.279 --> 955.079
hypocrisy in what I say is is that what

952.88 --> 955.079
you're

957.92 --> 960.92
doing

961.94 --> 969.1600000000001
[Music]

964.639 --> 971.6
oh oh yeah well real trolls are not

969.16 --> 973.4399999999999
welcome in my chat especially if the the

971.6 --> 978.48
only thing they do is just whine and

973.44 --> 978.48
[ __ ] and complain huh I get the [ __ ]

987.279 --> 992.88
out you brought up the

990.24 --> 995.12
series and I'm moan about it yeah it's

992.88 --> 995.12
My

995.519 --> 1000.6
Prerogative there's very few series that

998.0 --> 1002.68
I do like on Netflix especially the ones

1000.6 --> 1005.12
that are super popular and everybody

1002.68 --> 1007.279
knows about them I hate

1005.12 --> 1011.92
those

1007.279 --> 1015.279
mostly that's right there's hundreds if

1011.92 --> 1018.639
not thousands of

1015.279 --> 1019.8
terrible like Spirit draining series on

1018.639 --> 1022.72
that

1019.8 --> 1022.7199999999999
but there's a few good

1023.28 --> 1027.319
ones you just have to find

1030.039 --> 1035.039
them voice 12 Disney characters oh

1032.919 --> 1036.7990000000002
really debatable I had no idea I didn't

1035.039 --> 1040.839
know he voiced like that

1036.799 --> 1040.839
robot character in Rogue

1047.84 --> 1050.84
one

1054.44 --> 1061.28
but I mean he's a very capable voice

1057.72 --> 1066.96
actor and character actor

1061.28 --> 1066.96
so I'm surprised he isn't in more

1068.84 --> 1073.52
things but I think that he's just he's

1071.32 --> 1075.799
probably a very picky person he looks

1073.52 --> 1080.08
like a guy who's

1075.799 --> 1082.039
like actually burdened by intellect

1080.08 --> 1085.6789999999999
like he's one of those guys that's very

1082.039 --> 1090.72
smart but because of that he has issues

1085.679 --> 1090.72
with other people I totally recognize

1091.32 --> 1098.28
it so he going to be

1094.48 --> 1101.08
picky and he probably mostly wants like

1098.28 --> 1103.799
people around him he connects with and

1101.08 --> 1107.3999999999999
then do comedic things I think that is

1103.799 --> 1110.28
his thing it was his thing in the

1107.4 --> 1113.3200000000002
Firefly series

1110.28 --> 1117.48
and it seems to be his overall

1113.32 --> 1119.9189999999999
thing he voiced a chicken okay all

1117.48 --> 1119.919
righty

1137.72 --> 1140.72
then

1142.56 --> 1145.619
[Music]

1148.679 --> 1154.48
[ __ ]

1151.0 --> 1154.48
sake oh yeah

1155.48 --> 1162.559
yeah yeah I mean he's doing that and I

1160.32 --> 1162.559
don't

1167.72 --> 1170.72
know

1172.24 --> 1179.72
yeah duper I know about it I know

1174.32 --> 1182.559
there's entire troll cities troll cities

1179.72 --> 1185.88
worshiping me and making all this [ __ ]

1182.559 --> 1188.44
about me it's been like that for years

1185.88 --> 1191.3600000000001
duper

1188.44 --> 1193.6000000000001
years you don't have to remind me about

1191.36 --> 1193.6
it

1196.52 --> 1204.72
continually I'd like to talk about other

1200.559 --> 1207.799
things than hell hell mirroring itself

1204.72 --> 1209.84
against me yeah I don't want to know

1207.799 --> 1215.52
about that continually I don't want to

1209.84 --> 1215.52
be reminded about that especially by you

1224.799 --> 1235.2
duper oh steamy Travelers and what the

1230.64 --> 1235.2
okay he's still out there

weird

1240.4 --> 1244.0800000000002
that's

1242.61 --> 1246.9599999999998
[Music]

1244.08 --> 1249.48
unexpected I guess uh he's joined up

1246.96 --> 1252.48
with the whole [ __ ] out

1569.64 --> 1574.8400000000001
been made clear between us outside of

the

1578.52 --> 1586.399
whiny [ __ ] about it and think that you

that I that you owe all these things

1586.399 --> 1591.36
about me you don't

1589.159 --> 1595.3990000000001
you don't owe

yeah so don't bring that attitude or I

1609.279 --> 1612.279

down

1623.74 --> 1631.749
[Music]

1634.12 --> 1640.559
right all right by the way Ben John like

1636.64 --> 1644.0
where did you see see me traveler

1640.559 --> 1644.0
talking where was

1647.159 --> 1650.159
that

1652.44 --> 1657.44
culture kids is kind of a big deal on

1654.72 --> 1661.2
YouTube he likes to think

1657.44 --> 1661.2
so not really

1677.12 --> 1680.12
though

1680.76 --> 1686.0
getting yeah clutch I mean we basically

1683.96 --> 1691.279
just had a bit of a warm

1686.0 --> 1694.559
spell fed what what the [ __ ] I don't

1691.279 --> 1694.559
know if that's the real him

1695.159 --> 1699.72
though I don't think he'd ever like be

1698.279 --> 1702.159
part of

1699.72 --> 1705.799
that he couldn't

1702.159 --> 1708.72
stand fed like he was literally

1705.799 --> 1711.799
complaining about it for years like he

1708.72 --> 1714.76
hated it so that good chance that it

1711.799 --> 1715.9189999999999
wasn't really him they're probably just

1714.76 --> 1718.919
talking

1715.919 --> 1721.6000000000001
[ __ ] trying to create controversy trying

1718.919 --> 1724.24
to push my buttons directly indirectly

1721.6 --> 1728.32
they're really really [ __ ] desperate

1724.24 --> 1731.72
for attention like savagely murderously

1728.32 --> 1736.1589999999999
desperate for attention from

1731.72 --> 1736.159
me and doesn't

1737.039 --> 1743.08
work

1739.6 --> 1743.08
not falling for their stupid

1747.88 --> 1753.44
tricks I'll be talking about things that

1750.679 --> 1753.44
I find

1759.36 --> 1764.519
interesting like for example what I roll

1762.12 --> 1766.32
out on own Benjamin's yesterday when the

1764.519 --> 1767.76
troll start [ __ ] all over it it

1766.32 --> 1770.12
doesn't work though you're not going to

1767.76 --> 1771.48
stop me from bringing up these subjects

1770.12 --> 1774.1589999999999
and talking about

1771.48 --> 1778.96
it

1774.159 --> 1779.679
yeah like how the Jesuits went around

1778.96 --> 1781.88
the

1779.679 --> 1785.799
world a while

1781.88 --> 1788.0390000000002
ago and rewrote history everywhere they

1785.799 --> 1792.08
went and they rewrote it in a very

1788.039 --> 1795.1589999999999
consistent way where the rewrite would

1792.08 --> 1798.399
match the rewrites of other locations so

1795.159 --> 1801.88
they had big plan on how to do it

1798.399 --> 1806.0
objective on how to rewrite history but

1801.88 --> 1808.8400000000001
then well you can't literally rewrite

1806.0 --> 1810.399
everything so there were locations where

1808.84 --> 1813.519
they didn't

1810.399 --> 1817.8799999999999
go where they were stopped and those

1813.519 --> 1821.519
locations still had remnants of other

1817.88 --> 1823.0800000000002
history that literally doesn't match the

1821.519 --> 1825.279
Jesuit

1823.08 --> 1830.32
rewrite so there's like pieces of

1825.279 --> 1832.72
history that reference places that like

1830.32 --> 1836.6789999999999
no nowhere else is it referenced and

1832.72 --> 1839.3990000000001
it's like what happened to it like these

1836.679 --> 1843.2
Mysteries that are out there and that's

1839.399 --> 1846.559
a thing it's really fascinating

1843.2 --> 1848.72
and like mind unveiled is like really

1846.559 --> 1852.0
starting to figure that

1848.72 --> 1855.88
out revealing all kinds of interesting

1852.0 --> 1858.44
details of places that like officially

1855.88 --> 1861.8400000000001
don't exist but they're

1858.44 --> 1864.24
historical references to

1861.84 --> 1866.32
them it's really fascinating to think

1864.24 --> 1868.72
about it and like how does that

1866.32 --> 1870.279
work well we already know the Jesuits

1868.72 --> 1873.3600000000001
went

1870.279 --> 1876.12
around and they

1873.36 --> 1878.639
altered meddled with

1876.12 --> 1881.5189999999998
histories like in bigger governments

1878.639 --> 1884.519
everywhere like they dictated like how

1881.519 --> 1887.3990000000001
it would be written they rewrote history

1884.519 --> 1889.559
in a very specific way with very

1887.399 --> 1890.9189999999999
specific settings and parameters on how

1889.559 --> 1894.72
to do

1890.919 --> 1897.2
it that happened a long time ago and

1894.72 --> 1901.039
erased a whole bunch of data like

1897.2 --> 1903.48
creation based ancient data and but

1901.039 --> 1907.2
there's still all of

1903.48 --> 1911.72
that hidden out there it's just it's

1907.2 --> 1914.88
been kept secret passed on in occult

1911.72 --> 1917.24
circles kept secret very meticulously

1914.88 --> 1920.519
because if it would have been discovered

1917.24 --> 1922.519
Jesuits would literally come after them

1920.519 --> 1925.36
probably kill them and destroy the

1922.519 --> 1928.44
evidence especially destroy the evidence

1925.36 --> 1932.32
like destroy all the remaining works but

1928.44 --> 1935.88
now in the internet age their job which

1932.32 --> 1938.6789999999999
it is to destroy evidence of the history

1935.88 --> 1941.6390000000001
that they didn't write has become a lot

1938.679 --> 1942.88
more difficult because now people can

1941.639 --> 1945.039
literally

1942.88 --> 1948.72
just copy the

1945.039 --> 1951.799
book copy the images and just

1948.72 --> 1954.2
anonymously put it on the internet and

1951.799 --> 1957.48
now Jesuits could then go after it and

1954.2 --> 1961.6390000000001
take it down but it'll like they won't

1957.48 --> 1964.76
be able to destroy the source the origin

1961.639 --> 1967.6
so they're having a more difficult time

1964.76 --> 1971.44
since the internet age and a lot of

1967.6 --> 1971.4399999999998
information has leaked through that

1976.84 --> 1982.24
way right it's a very interesting thing

1979.96 --> 1982.24
to

1983.519 --> 1989.2
consider yeah and when I by the way

1986.08 --> 1990.36
mentioned the Jesuit guy it is literally

1989.2 --> 1994.96
what he

1990.36 --> 1994.9599999999998
did find and destroy

2003.0 --> 2009.399
evidence like my mother had collected

2006.2 --> 2013.159
like an ancient Mayan depiction of the

2009.399 --> 2016.76
realm like on a piece of paper or

2013.159 --> 2021.72
parchment or whatever that was and the

2016.76 --> 2021.72
Jesuit guy snatched it from me he stole

2024.0 --> 2030.039
it that happened like a decade ago he

2028.32 --> 2033.519
just stole it from

2030.039 --> 2035.519
me after he threatened to kill

2033.519 --> 2040.36
me

2035.519 --> 2040.36
right so yeah here's another another

2040.44 --> 2045.3200000000002
little just a little detail of how this

2043.12 --> 2047.639
freaking world Works what's actually

2045.32 --> 2049.3199999999997
going on out there yeah the Jesuits do

2047.639 --> 2053.2799999999997
actually do thing they're more than just

2049.32 --> 2055.8
a freaking assassin's gold Guild like

2053.28 --> 2056.239
John Wick would suggest now they're

2055.8 --> 2057.3990000000003
there

2056.239 --> 2059.2400000000002
[Music]

2057.399 --> 2063.5989999999997
to

2059.24 --> 2066.24
uphold their history it is their history

2063.599 --> 2068.76
they are the Arbiters and writers and

2066.24 --> 2072.24
keepers of the history

2068.76 --> 2075.8790000000004
that we all use in the west and not just

2072.24 --> 2079.72
in the west everywhere they wrote that

2075.879 --> 2082.1189999999997
they coordinated that history to make it

2079.72 --> 2084.0
cohesive enough for everybody to believe

2082.119 --> 2087.2000000000003
that it could really be

2084.0 --> 2089.679
history that's how it worked because it

2087.2 --> 2092.3199999999997
they did it on a massive scale and

2089.679 --> 2096.64
planned it carefully on how to connect

2092.32 --> 2099.6400000000003
up the false history that they would

2096.64 --> 2099.64
write

2104.6 --> 2107.69
[Music]

2113.359 --> 2116.88
but there's unique opportunities now

2115.44 --> 2119.44
things popping

2116.88 --> 2120.32
up other pieces of history that have

2119.44 --> 2124.88
been

2120.32 --> 2128.04
kept secret and safe potentially for

2124.88 --> 2130.119
centuries not an exaggeration for

2128.04 --> 2133.48
centuries kept

2130.119 --> 2136.44
safe completely like off the radar not

2133.48 --> 2140.079
like safe in some Museum or anything

2136.44 --> 2142.16
completely off the radar because if you

2140.079 --> 2146.2000000000003
put it on the radar the Jesuits will

2142.16 --> 2146.2
come and they will destroy

2146.44 --> 2152.48
it so they kept things off the Rader

2149.24 --> 2154.0
probably generation upon generation and

2152.48 --> 2157.76
since the

2154.0 --> 2160.88
internet they have put some of it back

2157.76 --> 2162.119
into the internet for people to bump

2160.88 --> 2164.92
into the

2162.119 --> 2169.28
study to go through and that is how a

2164.92 --> 2172.599
lot of things have been re

2169.28 --> 2178.8
revealed even throughout the Flat Earth

2172.599 --> 2181.839
Community like pretty damn sure that uh

2178.8 --> 2183.119
Flatwater has had some of these

2181.839 --> 2186.88
forbidden

2183.119 --> 2188.319
sources that he has opened up and in the

2186.88 --> 2191.04
very beginning

2188.319 --> 2195.319
when he just started out like

2191.04 --> 2197.079
2015 he was extremely anxious about it

2195.319 --> 2201.96
he removed those videos where he talked

2197.079 --> 2205.2000000000003
about that but he was because he knew

2201.96 --> 2211.079
that it was Jesuit forbidden

2205.2 --> 2211.0789999999997
information he said that even I remember

2211.44 --> 2217.2000000000003
that right I don't know if he' talk

2214.319 --> 2220.119
about it now but that's what it is and

2217.2 --> 2222.4399999999996
this is just an interesting fact of how

2220.119 --> 2224.92
things work out there and just wanted to

2222.44 --> 2224.92
share

2225.44 --> 2230.92
that so you realize like alternative

2229.04 --> 2234.52
history is a real

2230.92 --> 2237.7200000000003
thing Jesuits wrote the history the way

2234.52 --> 2242.52
things are supposed to have transpired

2237.72 --> 2246.319
as we learn it now it's their history

2242.52 --> 2248.319
they designed that history to overlap

2246.319 --> 2250.92
everything that's really happened

2248.319 --> 2254.52
in order to erase certain places that

2250.92 --> 2257.92
they just can't justify existing within

2254.52 --> 2257.92
the context of their

2260.64 --> 2266.72

just stop

2592.28 --> 2597.44
talking watch the video I just

2597.52 --> 2603.839

2600.76 --> 2606.0
what I was just talking about because

2603.839 --> 2609.119
you before you all start whining about

2606.0 --> 2609.119
something inconsequent

2620.839 --> 2625.64
yeah I it is [ __ ] annoying one more

2623.8 --> 2629.599
[ __ ] reference duper and you're out

2625.64 --> 2629.5989999999997
forever now shut the [ __ ]

2630.63 --> 2633.849
[Music]

2636.04 --> 2639.04
up

2652.93 --> 2659.24
[Music]

2654.76 --> 2659.2400000000002
tartaria yeah tartaria that's

2660.839 --> 2667.2
right Taria is

2664.16 --> 2669.8799999999997
part China and everything and even part

2667.2 --> 2672.839
of the US and it's been erased and the

2669.88 --> 2677.6800000000003
Jesuits erased

2672.839 --> 2681.359
it remnants of it still leaked

2677.68 --> 2684.9199999999996
forth and those remnants literally don't

2681.359 --> 2684.92
match the history as we know

2686.04 --> 2692.8
it because the history we know is the

2689.92 --> 2692.8
Jesuit

2695.68 --> 2700.9199999999996
history and that's the point I've been

2698.2 --> 2700.9199999999996
trying to

2702.24 --> 2707.1189999999997
make I guess I have to yell at you and

2705.0 --> 2709.559
threaten to kick you out before anybody

2707.119 --> 2713.2000000000003
of you actually starts to [ __ ] listen

2709.559 --> 2715.96
and pay attention to anything I

2713.2 --> 2718.7599999999998
say it's a ridiculous bunch of

2715.96 --> 2718.76
distracted

2725.96 --> 2728.96
children

2743.28 --> 2748.8900000000003
alternative history was not my thing no

2745.599 --> 2752.0800000000004
it is my thing it's just

2748.89 --> 2752.08
[Music]

2753.64 --> 2758.7599999999998
not I'm not like a typical historical re

2757.04 --> 2761.319
Searcher but I mean it is my thing

2758.76 --> 2765.079
clutch I've been follow mind and Ville

2761.319 --> 2765.079
is like a very good source for

2768.599 --> 2773.079
it they've been revealing a lot of

2781.079 --> 2790.3590000000004
that and I want you all to consider

2785.0 --> 2790.359
it want you to really ize how that

2794.27 --> 2797.38
[Music]

2798.04 --> 2806.64
works oh okay clutch right yeah yes that

2803.319 --> 2809.88
that guy is also talking about it's just

2806.64 --> 2813.319
that the way he represents things in his

2809.88 --> 2818.76
videos is like it's not my format it's

2813.319 --> 2821.8
not my my way but I understand that I

2818.76 --> 2821.8
understand that he's into

2823.04 --> 2831.599
that I prefer the Mind unveil team

2826.559 --> 2832.96
more CU they just present it in a very

2831.599 --> 2836.319
doable

2832.96 --> 2838.839
way that is just much better to be

2836.319 --> 2841.359
absorbed and like without fear porn

2838.839 --> 2843.4
that's very important because a lot of

2841.359 --> 2845.839
people that just bring up Jesuits they

2843.4 --> 2849.119
just bring up the fear porn about

2845.839 --> 2851.319
it the Mind unfilled like really focuses

2849.119 --> 2854.6800000000003
on trying to piece together

2851.319 --> 2857.2
this this lost

2854.68 --> 2860.16
history with like soothing music and

2857.2 --> 2863.1189999999997
everything and sometimes a bit nervous

2860.16 --> 2866.0
but it it just works it works for

2863.119 --> 2869.599
me but yeah that static in the Attic

2866.0 --> 2873.52
probably works for you clutch it's all

2869.599 --> 2875.839
good free of fear porn okay maybe maybe

2873.52 --> 2878.839
I'll have to give it another

2875.839 --> 2878.839
look

2903.0 --> 2907.92
H hey look for

2905.76 --> 2911.0
evolution

2907.92 --> 2911.0
now I know what you look

2923.28 --> 2929.599
like sh light on just with in obsession

2926.88 --> 2933.0
with control over societ yeah and

2929.599 --> 2935.28
why especially why did they do it they

2933.0 --> 2939.599
did it

2935.28 --> 2942.2400000000002
because they need needed to erase all

2939.599 --> 2948.559
this history that would

2942.24 --> 2952.68
obstruct their Reformation of science

2948.559 --> 2954.92
right because heliocentric Globe Earth

2952.68 --> 2958.839
and outer space universe and the ideas

2954.92 --> 2960.04
of evolution they are all theirs it's

2958.839 --> 2962.4
their

2960.04 --> 2965.24
cosmology but in order for that to

2962.4 --> 2967.88
basically take over they needed to

2965.24 --> 2971.0
erase the ancient history that would

2967.88 --> 2974.359
just prove all of it completely

2971.0 --> 2977.2
wrong that's why they probably did it

2974.359 --> 2980.2
that's why they went around to rewrite

2977.2 --> 2983.9199999999996
history because history would get in the

2980.2 --> 2983.9199999999996
way of the globe

2995.64 --> 2998.64
religion

3012.54 --> 3021.81
[Music]

3025.64 --> 3028.64
e

3029.0 --> 3031.76
put that in the

3039.37 --> 3042.5299999999997
[Music]

3055.64 --> 3058.64
title

3070.2 --> 3074.359
yes there you go now with a

3076.119 --> 3084.599
title fit perfectly it's all in it you

3081.4 --> 3084.599
just watched the video

3085.559 --> 3088.559
good

3089.319 --> 3094.4
how can you distinguish between the real

3091.88 --> 3097.96
history and the fake history well the

3094.4 --> 3100.559
fake history is cohesive with all the

3097.96 --> 3103.0
other typical history that we've learned

3100.559 --> 3105.4
that's how you know something really

3103.0 --> 3109.359
doesn't fit in between

3105.4 --> 3109.359
yet it is connected

3109.839 --> 3116.2799999999997
up like it does reference real figures

3113.799 --> 3118.7599999999998
and then like something strange happens

3116.28 --> 3124.0
so like

3118.76 --> 3127.3590000000004
hey the Chinese emperor or whatever he

3124.0 --> 3129.68
looks kind of white like that's like

3127.359 --> 3133.96
whoa that

3129.68 --> 3135.64
means it's the unaltered version it's

3133.96 --> 3137.92
like there's some things that are just

3135.64 --> 3140.1189999999997
really weird and like that doesn't match

3137.92 --> 3142.52
it doesn't match what we've been the

3140.119 --> 3144.7200000000003
overall picture we've been given well

3142.52 --> 3146.88
that's a sign that it's

3144.72 --> 3149.4399999999996
unaltered that it is actually the

3146.88 --> 3151.7200000000003
original history if some things

3149.44 --> 3154.92
about pieces of information and

3151.72 --> 3157.7599999999998
depictions are like really out of place

3154.92 --> 3159.4
like hey that seems wrong how it's not

3157.76 --> 3160.48
supposed to be like that if you have

3159.4 --> 3164.1600000000003
that

3160.48 --> 3167.44
response you're probably

3164.16 --> 3168.8799999999997
dealing with the actual history that has

3167.44 --> 3172.119
not been

3168.88 --> 3175.599
altered and it just like weirdly moves

3172.119 --> 3177.0
out of place it's just like it's hey

3175.599 --> 3179.76
it's not tell

3177.0 --> 3183.559
me the same thing that all the other

3179.76 --> 3183.559
history stuff about it is telling

3184.319 --> 3193.5589999999997
me and like it's the most normal thing

3188.799 --> 3197.079
ever that is how you know it's difficult

3193.559 --> 3200.559
it might take a lot of effort and time

3197.079 --> 3203.6400000000003
and focus to even be able to do

3200.559 --> 3205.2000000000003
that you might not have it in you but if

3203.64 --> 3208.64
something is just

3205.2 --> 3211.799
history and then suddenly depictions or

3208.64 --> 3215.72
stories descriptions start to go out of

3211.799 --> 3219.359
place that is a Telltale sign like hey

3215.72 --> 3222.8799999999997
that's actually unaltered history that's

3219.359 --> 3226.7599999999998
pre- Jesuit history that kind of slipped

3222.88 --> 3230.119
past them probably he been kept secret

3226.76 --> 3232.119
or like rigorously protected against

3230.119 --> 3234.839
Jesuits meddling with

3232.119 --> 3236.599
it in the open might still be places in

3234.839 --> 3238.16
the open that just like no we have have

3236.599 --> 3240.1600000000003
our history Jesuits are not going to

3238.16 --> 3242.5989999999997
medle with this like if they try we

3240.16 --> 3246.1189999999997
literally kill

3242.599 --> 3246.119
them that sort of

3249.76 --> 3255.7990000000004
[ __ ] do we know if tartarians were a

3253.16 --> 3260.319
great fishing Nation well they probably

3255.799 --> 3260.319
were a great many

3260.359 --> 3268.359
things fishing Nation would not surprise

3265.359 --> 3268.359
me

3278.81 --> 3283.24
[Music]

3281.079 --> 3286.7200000000003
all right so now we have an actual

3283.24 --> 3288.5589999999997
subject to talk about all the trolls can

3286.72 --> 3291.5589999999997
[ __ ] off with their stupid

3288.559 --> 3291.559
inconsequential

3292.88 --> 3297.28
nonsense cuz they don't want to hear it

3295.799 --> 3299.28
they don't want to hear things that are

3297.28 --> 3301.76
too real it hurts them it just makes

3299.28 --> 3304.96
them feel like oh yeah you are just a

3301.76 --> 3308.92
[ __ ] slave wasting your time in a

3304.96 --> 3310.0
world that's actually hostile to truth

3308.92 --> 3313.359
and

3310.0 --> 3315.2
you and that inner flame inside of you

3313.359 --> 3317.359
that actually wants to know the truth

3315.2 --> 3319.68
it's hostile the world is hostile

3317.359 --> 3322.88
against you and you're a slave to them

3319.68 --> 3325.359
and you waste everybody's [ __ ] time

3322.88 --> 3327.359
because of that because of that fear the

3325.359 --> 3331.64
fear of the conf frontation with the

3327.359 --> 3335.319
truth I know what it is that drives you

3331.64 --> 3335.319
yeah I know what that

3340.96 --> 3346.64
is a parallels connections between

3344.4 --> 3349.64
tartaria and

3346.64 --> 3349.64
Atlantis

3351.039 --> 3358.2400000000002
no Atlantis was a different era and a

3355.559 --> 3358.2400000000002
different location

3360.359 --> 3366.359
Atlantis is more

3362.92 --> 3366.359
about West

3369.039 --> 3377.4
Africa and ancient Egypt and

3373.839 --> 3382.359
like lost very old

3377.4 --> 3388.88
history tartaria is much more

3382.359 --> 3393.119
Reon like Taria is like was still 19th

3388.88 --> 3396.079
century it's been recently

3393.119 --> 3398.839
erased and that's why the gaps and the

3396.079 --> 3401.28
hole are much bigger

3398.839 --> 3404.96
because the more

3401.28 --> 3407.1600000000003
close to us within the timeline it is

3404.96 --> 3409.0
the harder it is to actually erase all

3407.16 --> 3413.24
history

3409.0 --> 3416.079
because the closer by the more material

3413.24 --> 3419.1189999999997
and writings and like the more people

3416.079 --> 3421.6800000000003
could could actually write language the

3419.119 --> 3424.359
more art there was the more availability

3421.68 --> 3426.5989999999997
of writing materials and now we're

3424.359 --> 3430.16
dealing even with electronic storage and

3426.599 --> 3432.6400000000003
all that so the closer by it is the more

3430.16 --> 3435.799
hard it was to actually remove it yet

3432.64 --> 3437.92
they still had the goal to do that they

3435.799 --> 3440.599
still had the goal to just try to erase

3437.92 --> 3443.119
that entire Empire from

3440.599 --> 3448.039
existing even though it's like not even

3443.119 --> 3451.7200000000003
200 years ago and they sort of exceeded

3448.039 --> 3455.039
but the leaks the leaks of true

3451.72 --> 3455.0389999999998
information are

3455.799 --> 3462.359
endless and now those leaks are starting

3458.559 --> 3465.76
to show and with it like the entire

3462.359 --> 3467.2
Jesuit web of historical deception is

3465.76 --> 3471.0
being

3467.2 --> 3474.5589999999997
exposed and realized and through the

3471.0 --> 3477.76
internet lots of people right lots of

3474.559 --> 3480.1600000000003
people are finding that out

3477.76 --> 3481.1600000000003
and it has way more impact than just

3480.16 --> 3484.5589999999997
flat

3481.16 --> 3486.68
earth right cu the Flat Earth the

3484.559 --> 3489.8390000000004
Jesuits have already

3486.68 --> 3492.7599999999998
mechanically dealt with that yeah the

3489.839 --> 3494.88
globe religion people that are into that

3492.76 --> 3496.7990000000004
there's nothing that can dissuade them

3494.88 --> 3499.48
from the Earth being Globe nothing they

3496.799 --> 3501.119
will twist reality itself in every

3499.48 --> 3504.119
conceivable way

3501.119 --> 3506.6800000000003
mathematically and otherwise and they

3504.119 --> 3510.119
will not like they can believe the globe

3506.68 --> 3512.839
no matter what so that is like not much

3510.119 --> 3514.52
of a worry it's actually quite doable

3512.839 --> 3516.88
and it will create distraction from

3514.52 --> 3522.24
people that are not into

3516.88 --> 3525.6400000000003
it however them rewriting history even

3522.24 --> 3529.1189999999997
recently that is much more

3525.64 --> 3532.68
problematic and like the more you learn

3529.119 --> 3532.6800000000003
the more it becomes really

3534.359 --> 3539.64
irreversible yeah because Flat Earth and

3537.24 --> 3542.799
Globe Earth arguments can just get you

3539.64 --> 3544.5589999999997
caught up all the time and you'll

3542.799 --> 3546.52
eventually like not really progress

3544.559 --> 3549.2400000000002
you'll just learn about the psychology

3546.52 --> 3551.52
of how the ball Ballers think and how

3549.24 --> 3555.0
they avoid the questions and it just

3551.52 --> 3557.0389999999998
becomes basic philosophy and all that in

3555.0 --> 3560.0
that sense but

3557.039 --> 3563.28
like pieces of history that literally

3560.0 --> 3566.559
don't match and just keep popping up and

3563.28 --> 3570.2400000000002
start to eventually form a scattered but

3566.559 --> 3571.559
still cohesive Enough original true

3570.24 --> 3575.319
history

3571.559 --> 3577.8390000000004
picture like that sucks in massive

3575.319 --> 3580.839
amounts of enthusiasm and

3577.839 --> 3584.799
energy because people will actually want

3580.839 --> 3589.799
to reconstruct the real history

3584.799 --> 3591.92
now and the Jesuits are in big big

3589.799 --> 3595.2
problems with

3591.92 --> 3598.4
that they can't really do anything about

3595.2 --> 3599.9199999999996
it and even if they'd like create a

3598.4 --> 3603.119
total World War and just start

3599.92 --> 3606.319
destroying everything it still is not

3603.119 --> 3608.799
going to stop like nothing can stop

3606.319 --> 3612.16
their end is coming the end of their

3608.799 --> 3614.92
deception about history is coming and

3612.16 --> 3618.44
there's nothing they can do to stop it

3614.92 --> 3618.44
nothing nothing at

3624.119 --> 3629.799
all it is so l nothing that like no

3627.68 --> 3632.839
matter the extremities that they would

3629.799 --> 3635.079
consider like Exterminating all mankind

3632.839 --> 3638.319
destroying All

3635.079 --> 3644.2400000000002
Electronics like it doesn't

3638.319 --> 3648.079
work it doesn't work they can't stop it

3644.24 --> 3651.359
so it is like a a frightening bar that's

3648.079 --> 3654.1600000000003
moving to them to their objectives and

3651.359 --> 3654.16
it cannot be

3654.2 --> 3659.4399999999996
stopped even if everything is blown up

3656.839 --> 3662.88
it will still not be

3659.44 --> 3665.44
stopped because you can't truly demote

3662.88 --> 3667.96
you can't make everybody forget about

3665.44 --> 3671.319
the technology that we've had technology

3667.96 --> 3673.2
is too easy to reuse to rebuild to

3671.319 --> 3675.2799999999997
reestablish and with all that

3673.2 --> 3676.319
reestablishment comes back all that

3675.28 --> 3678.96
other

3676.319 --> 3680.88
knowledge because people really deep

3678.96 --> 3682.599
inside want the truth and they realize

3680.88 --> 3684.44
that all the technology and everything

3682.599 --> 3687.28
and the education has been used to

3684.44 --> 3691.119
enslave their minds and they're going to

3687.28 --> 3693.6400000000003
free themselves no matter what the genie

3691.119 --> 3697.119
is out of the

3693.64 --> 3698.2799999999997
bottle meticulously created bottle that

3697.119 --> 3700.92
took

3698.28 --> 3706.52
centuries but now that it's out like it

3700.92 --> 3711.16
can't be put back in no matter

3706.52 --> 3711.16
what people are going to figure it

3711.799 --> 3717.839
out more and more and they'll remind me

3715.52 --> 3719.799
tons of people that don't want to know

3717.839 --> 3723.44
it's inconsequential because there's

3719.799 --> 3723.44
going to be enough people that will

3727.44 --> 3732.2000000000003
know oh

3729.48 --> 3735.079
look during the mud

3732.2 --> 3739.8799999999997
flood uh I don't think the mud flood is

3735.079 --> 3739.88
real I think that is a nonsense

3740.68 --> 3746.96
distraction if anything mud flood was

3743.079 --> 3748.76
just like Sonic weapons or something

3746.96 --> 3751.079
may have been mud flood may have been

3748.76 --> 3754.2400000000002
part of technology that was

3751.079 --> 3757.7200000000003
used like Sonic technology used to

3754.24 --> 3757.72
literally bury entire

3758.119 --> 3764.559
locations which is what seemed to have

3760.44 --> 3768.279
happened right ancient tartarian cities

3764.559 --> 3771.44
even in China that were like

3768.279 --> 3774.599
enormous they completely disappeared

3771.44 --> 3776.559
they're untraceable how do you do that

3774.599 --> 3780.079
well by completely

3776.559 --> 3780.079
letting them sink into the

3784.4 --> 3789.92
ground good title yeah it does make

3787.359 --> 3792.92
perfect sense and it is true it's not

3789.92 --> 3792.92
something I just made

3800.0 --> 3806.359
up yeah man goeth because we're at the

3803.24 --> 3808.16
point where Word of Mouth

3806.359 --> 3812.0
can sustain

3808.16 --> 3812.839
it like you can't stop it you can't stop

3812.0 --> 3816.24
it

3812.839 --> 3819.68
anymore in this age it's the age of the

3816.24 --> 3821.7599999999998
Apocalypse the age of revealing and it

3819.68 --> 3823.96
cannot be

3821.76 --> 3826.44
unrevealed you can't put it back in the

3823.96 --> 3832.16
Box yeah the Age of Apocalypse is an age

3826.44 --> 3832.16
it's not a moment it's an age it's

3834.72 --> 3837.72
irreversible

3838.16 --> 3844.279
the age of Jesuit reality is at an

3846.86 --> 3850.079
[Music]

3857.44 --> 3865.16
end T something to do this who knows I'm

3862.0 --> 3866.599
not entirely sure like how far Tartarus

3865.16 --> 3868.52
spaned

3866.599 --> 3872.279
but it was

3868.52 --> 3874.64
big and it was from what I've understand

3872.279 --> 3879.64
thus far it's

3874.64 --> 3884.279
mostly Russia China what is now called

3879.64 --> 3886.4
Mongolia and the west of the United

3884.279 --> 3889.44
States like

3886.4 --> 3892.039
Alaska Washington State

3889.44 --> 3895.4
California and even pieces of Mexico

3892.039 --> 3900.2400000000002
like that is what Teraria was it was

3895.4 --> 3900.2400000000002
basic basically the Pacific Empire in a

3901.359 --> 3907.72
way but who knows maybe Scotland was

3904.64 --> 3912.1189999999997
like an outpost or something maybe they

3907.72 --> 3917.4399999999996
did like have England and Ireland

3912.119 --> 3917.44
too I'm not sure I yeah maybe

3917.599 --> 3922.839
like in entire Scandinavia I'm not

3924.64 --> 3929.0789999999997
sure

3927.2 --> 3931.799
and it's hard to tell because the

3929.079 --> 3934.88
Jesuits definitely went everywhere in

3931.799 --> 3935.92
Europe and they they erased it like they

3934.88 --> 3939.079
erased

3935.92 --> 3942.76
it they erased that that it

3939.079 --> 3944.48
existed they've erased folkl ancient

3942.76 --> 3947.5200000000004
myths and

3944.48 --> 3950.319
stories that are now they're still they

3947.52 --> 3953.359
still exist but they're rare and again

3950.319 --> 3956.16
you read about them or I don't other

3953.359 --> 3958.24
people that are actually historical

3956.16 --> 3959.72
researchers they read about it and it's

3958.24 --> 3961.64
like wow they're telling all these

3959.72 --> 3964.4399999999996
things and it just doesn't match

3961.64 --> 3966.5989999999997
anything like that's it doesn't match

3964.44 --> 3970.88
the history we've been taught

3966.599 --> 3970.88
again right that's how you

3971.079 --> 3976.88
know if it's revealing like entire

3974.319 --> 3980.5589999999997
cultures and ways of doing things and

3976.88 --> 3984.1600000000003
like location bound and describes

3980.559 --> 3986.4
places that are like they don't match

3984.16 --> 3990.96
anything that you've learned that is

3986.4 --> 3995.599
officially true well then you know

3990.96 --> 3995.599
that's like pre- Jesuit

4006.079 --> 4011.279
history the cuisine yeah yeah

4014.52 --> 4017.52
whatever

4023.72 --> 4026.0789999999997
no you

4028.319 --> 4033.119
didn't I don't want your

4030.64 --> 4034.2
whining this very serious conversation

4033.119 --> 4038.0
called your

4034.2 --> 4038.0
cats you're a [ __ ]

4038.16 --> 4042.1189999999997
troll I don't want you in

4044.52 --> 4047.52
here

4052.88 --> 4059.2400000000002
right but yeah tartaria would have had

4057.0 --> 4063.24
books because tartaria

4059.24 --> 4066.16
existed in the age where book

4063.24 --> 4069.7599999999998
printing already

4066.16 --> 4071.68
existed so yes they would have

4069.76 --> 4073.8390000000004
had

4071.68 --> 4076.44
building

4073.839 --> 4078.0389999999998
Arts paintings

4076.44 --> 4080.2000000000003
with the paintings might have been

4078.039 --> 4082.44
easily to slip through it's just like oh

4080.2 --> 4085.5989999999997
it's just it's just art it's just Oh

4082.44 --> 4087.599
What A peculiar style they would have

4085.599 --> 4090.2400000000002
left that alone like they wouldn't have

4087.599 --> 4094.44
any need to destroy it it would just be

4090.24 --> 4097.4
assimilated by another people

4094.44 --> 4099.679
like the Russian people which were

4097.4 --> 4102.0
technically a part of Teraria it's just

4099.679 --> 4104.4400000000005
that slightly rearrange it and now it

4102.0 --> 4106.08
has a slightly different

4104.44 --> 4108.199
history

4106.08 --> 4110.199
like I don't think like Russian

4108.199 --> 4112.919999999999
Federation is very happy about the

4110.199 --> 4112.919999999999
revealing of

4122.359 --> 4126.719
tartaria how big was

4124.6 --> 4131.1990000000005
tartaria very

4126.719 --> 4133.64
big it was like the entirety of

4131.199 --> 4136.719
Asia

4133.64 --> 4141.12
and the West of the

4136.719 --> 4141.12
Americas it was like the complete

4141.96 --> 4147.64
Pacific you could compare it to the

4144.92 --> 4148.4
Byzantine the Byzantine Empire around

4147.64 --> 4151.2390000000005
the

4148.4 --> 4154.48
Mediterranean it was like that it was

4151.239 --> 4157.599999999999
like an entire Coastline except this one

4154.48 --> 4159.48
was around the entire Pacific and deep

4157.6 --> 4163.04
land

4159.48 --> 4167.3589999999995
inward so like Russia

4163.04 --> 4167.359
China and the west of America

4167.6 --> 4174.1990000000005
big very very

4170.56 --> 4176.080000000001
big and probably even in ways too big

4174.199 --> 4178.678999999999
too big for

4176.08 --> 4183.4
its for its

4178.679 --> 4187.799
maintenance but it it's very likely that

4183.4 --> 4191.159
it came into being as a like a very

4187.799 --> 4194.199
Progressive type of Empire where like

4191.159 --> 4197.04
the American idea in a way of like

4194.199 --> 4199.96
developing technology and just becoming

4197.04 --> 4201.92
needed and wanted and if you're needed

4199.96 --> 4204.0
and wanted and like you have always

4201.92 --> 4208.4800000000005
things that you like people love about

4204.0 --> 4210.92
you about your products then it's very

4208.48 --> 4213.919999999999
easy to be a very big Empire because you

4210.92 --> 4216.28
don't have enemies everywhere but that

4213.92 --> 4218.1990000000005
probably changed around then suddenly

4216.28 --> 4222.12
they did get enemies everywhere and then

4218.199 --> 4224.759999999999
they found themselves not really being

4222.12 --> 4226.4
capable of actually sustaining the

4224.76 --> 4229.12
Empire as as a

4226.4 --> 4234.879999999999
whole

4229.12 --> 4238.64
because it was very big and

4234.88 --> 4241.28
not primarily military oriented but

4238.64 --> 4243.76
really like technologically development

4241.28 --> 4247.12
and art

4243.76 --> 4247.12
oriented as an

4250.239 --> 4256.199
Empire yes clutch I know that

4253.48 --> 4258.919999999999
yeah I know I I

4256.199 --> 4261.759999999999
I'm using the Jesuit history version so

4258.92 --> 4264.08
that people have more to reflect upon

4261.76 --> 4269.12
when I mention the byzantines yeah I

4264.08 --> 4269.12
know it's it is a cluster

4269.199 --> 4274.96
screw right everybody knows the Jesuit

4272.0 --> 4276.84
version so I use those words as a

4274.96 --> 4282.28
reference so people kind of understand

4276.84 --> 4282.28
the form not to legitimize the Jesuit

4282.6 --> 4288.400000000001
version unfortunately everybody's

4285.56 --> 4291.080000000001
learned in school history that is

4288.4 --> 4295.12
technically Jesuit version so that's

4291.08 --> 4295.12
what people have to reflect

4299.92 --> 4304.28
upon so I will still reference those

4302.679 --> 4307.04
things

4304.28 --> 4310.28
like yeah can't I can't just keep

4307.04 --> 4314.04
comparing to things that nobody knows

4310.28 --> 4314.04
about like that doesn't

4314.239 --> 4317.239
help

4322.28 --> 4326.44
I wonder if the Teran got erased well it

4324.48 --> 4327.5199999999995
didn't really get erased there was just

4326.44 --> 4330.5199999999995
Wars

4327.52 --> 4334.96
everywhere and

4330.52 --> 4338.8
then the new Empire form the Jesuits

4334.96 --> 4342.44
won and they created the Russia out of

4338.8 --> 4345.88
it and they created China out of it the

4342.44 --> 4349.12
way it is right now and west of America

4345.88 --> 4352.4800000000005
kind of like they were just

4349.12 --> 4356.0
left left there did you know that the

4352.48 --> 4358.638999999999
west of America was like full of Chinese

4356.0 --> 4361.639
like lots of them they were called

4358.639 --> 4365.28
supposed to Chinese laborers but they

4361.639 --> 4368.4400000000005
were they were like living their

4365.28 --> 4371.599999999999
generationally it's crazy and then they

4368.44 --> 4377.0
were kind of like just shoved off later

4371.6 --> 4379.639
in in favor of like American

4377.0 --> 4382.4
rearrangement of of the country they

4379.639 --> 4382.400000000001
were like pushed

4389.08 --> 4396.08
out I don't know

4392.36 --> 4398.839999999999
duper I'm not talking about the Jesuit

4396.08 --> 4402.0
fashion not talking about the actual

4398.84 --> 4402.0
history not about

4404.12 --> 4407.12
Jesuits

4425.639 --> 4430.32
right I'm getting hungry I'm going to

4427.199 --> 4433.96
put my Illuminati C on in the oven and

4430.32 --> 4433.96
make some coffee I'll be right

4434.04 --> 4437.04
back

4494.0 --> 4497.0
e

4523.96 --> 4526.96
e

4554.52 --> 4556.92
and I'm

4567.6 --> 4571.08
back what was

4579.04 --> 4584.36
that right but yeah a man go tartarian

4582.12 --> 4588.28
Empire got erased because it had too

4584.36 --> 4590.92
much power and knowledge and it wouldn't

4588.28 --> 4595.28
work along with the Jesuits they were

4590.92 --> 4598.159
enemy of the Jesuits they were Christian

4595.28 --> 4601.4
they were an ancient form of

4598.159 --> 4605.36
Christian that and they

4601.4 --> 4607.799999999999
had insights on how the Catholics

4605.36 --> 4610.48
corrupted the Bible corrupted

4607.8 --> 4614.400000000001
Christianity as a whole and influenced

4610.48 --> 4616.799999999999
everybody so they were like an opposer

4614.4 --> 4620.4
to they were basically the direct

4616.8 --> 4620.400000000001
religious enemies to the

4621.679 --> 4627.679
Jesuits they were Christian they were

4624.84 --> 4632.08
like old

4627.679 --> 4632.08
Christian pre catholic

4637.4 --> 4643.239
christian which probably is the thing

4640.44 --> 4646.199
that eventually formed but not without

4643.239 --> 4648.32
Jesuit meddling absolutely not I mean

4646.199 --> 4650.839999999999
people that say that are just kidding

4648.32 --> 4653.679
them they're just deluding themselves

4650.84 --> 4657.2390000000005
they're like the what orthod what is

4653.679 --> 4658.32
Orthodox Christianity Today that is what

4657.239 --> 4662.718999999999
they

4658.32 --> 4665.28
had they only Orthodox Christianity is

4662.719 --> 4668.4800000000005
post Jesuit

4665.28 --> 4668.48
medling it

4670.88 --> 4676.679
is they still have their own ways of

4674.96 --> 4678.88
doing it that are very different from

4676.679 --> 4683.8
the Catholic

4678.88 --> 4685.96
but it is kind of obvious that they have

4683.8 --> 4692.2390000000005
been meddled

4685.96 --> 4692.2390000000005
with because the Jesuits won they

4697.32 --> 4704.239
won they won the war against tartaria

4700.56 --> 4708.280000000001
and tartaria fell split up and history

4704.239 --> 4711.04
was re written for every aspect of it

4708.28 --> 4713.239
Russia got its own Rewritten history and

4711.04 --> 4716.04
it still has giant amounts of

4713.239 --> 4718.28
History right like you could argue that

4716.04 --> 4722.48
a lot of Russia's history

4718.28 --> 4722.48
is also tartarian

4722.84 --> 4729.4400000000005
history it's just that it would have

4725.48 --> 4732.239
been meticulously worked at to get

4729.44 --> 4735.599999999999
details out of it that would actually

4732.239 --> 4740.759999999999
prove it was also tartaria

4735.6 --> 4740.76
and China got like an even more extreme

4741.48 --> 4750.08
treatment it's what they do they re they

4745.4 --> 4753.199
won they broke it up and they rewrote

4750.08 --> 4757.0
history cuz that's when the Jesuits win

4753.199 --> 4760.36
a war against an opponent they they

4757.0 --> 4761.88
erase them they erased that they had

4760.36 --> 4766.719
ever

4761.88 --> 4766.719
existed that's how what they do

4768.08 --> 4772.5199999999995
if it was all changed then how was it

4770.04 --> 4774.56
uncovered because you can't literally

4772.52 --> 4777.0
erase absolutely

4774.56 --> 4779.76
everything you can just have control

4777.0 --> 4783.8
over the education and historical

4779.76 --> 4785.320000000001
institutes so that there's a main line

4783.8 --> 4788.1990000000005
cohesive

4785.32 --> 4791.239
narrative that resonates and matches

4788.199 --> 4794.0
with all the other institutional

4791.239 --> 4796.12
narratives and that way that is what

4794.0 --> 4798.48
everybody gets to teach but you can't

4796.12 --> 4800.599999999999
like they remove books and stuff that

4798.48 --> 4802.44
doesn't match but there's always going

4800.6 --> 4805.52
to be things that slip through their

4802.44 --> 4808.44
fingers especially when it comes to some

4805.52 --> 4813.320000000001
Empire that is that huge and there would

4808.44 --> 4815.839999999999
have been people like Wizards

4813.32 --> 4817.48
researchers keepers of knowledge priests

4815.84 --> 4819.719
that have been like yeah they know

4817.48 --> 4821.12
Jesuits they know what they do and they

4819.719 --> 4825.639
would have

4821.12 --> 4829.12
hidden key information

4825.639 --> 4831.679
like at all cost at all cost including

4829.12 --> 4831.679
their own

4833.4 --> 4838.5599999999995
life cuz they knew they were the keepers

4836.159 --> 4840.36
of the truth and the Jesuits would come

4838.56 --> 4843.1990000000005
and destroy it so they had to like

4840.36 --> 4844.839999999999
protect it at all cost including like

4843.199 --> 4848.32
generational

4844.84 --> 4850.6
secrecy and like hidden tombs just to

4848.32 --> 4851.799999999999
contain the information and ET said all

4850.6 --> 4853.639
that sort of

4851.8 --> 4856.08
stuff and

4853.639 --> 4859.52
so

4856.08 --> 4864.04
then the internet age arrived and now a

4859.52 --> 4867.120000000001
lot of that secret stuff has been dug up

4864.04 --> 4869.28
and put on the internet anonymously and

4867.12 --> 4870.88
now it's floating out there for people

4869.28 --> 4874.639
to bump

4870.88 --> 4877.52
into and yeah you can erase it but it'll

4874.639 --> 4877.52
just repop

4878.199 --> 4882.879999999999
up that's why we're bumping into this

4880.96 --> 4886.88
information right now when it's been

4882.88 --> 4889.400000000001
kept secret for over for 100 years 200

4886.88 --> 4889.400000000001
years or

4891.199 --> 4896.159

4913.52 --> 4919.679
again

4916.239 --> 4922.4

Foundation meddling with the medical

4994.92 --> 5001.4800000000005
system

4996.639 --> 5004.76
too the big part early 1900s was like

5001.48 --> 5008.32
the the destruction of Health that's

5004.76 --> 5011.96
where the real evil necromancy influence

5008.32 --> 5017.679
started coming in where Health Care was

5011.96 --> 5021.04
no longer healing but like medical

5017.679 --> 5021.04
interventions getting

5033.44 --> 5040.0
worse right but the 20th Cent yeah was

5036.639 --> 5045.56
also the year when they started

5040.0 --> 5045.56
to Brick topper could you [ __ ] stop

5102.36 --> 5108.0
out yeah we're talking about something

5105.32 --> 5111.0
you're just being a whiny distraction to

5108.0 --> 5115.199
that this is a good

5111.0 --> 5115.199
subject no [ __ ]

5121.159 --> 5126.32
distractions right so yeah

5126.639 --> 5134.04
20th century is

5129.32 --> 5137.92
when the re-education happened in a big

5134.04 --> 5139.76
way right it's when they gradually

5137.92 --> 5143.36
started to

5139.76 --> 5144.400000000001
introduce the Jesuit cosmology the the

5143.36 --> 5147.08
globe

5144.4 --> 5148.599999999999
Earth and outer space all those things

5147.08 --> 5152.4
when they started to suddenly

5148.6 --> 5154.76
standardize it because before that it

5152.4 --> 5158.119
was the secret

5154.76 --> 5161.92
Wizards Jesuit cosmology that they would

5158.119 --> 5163.96
keep to themselves it was their thing

5161.92 --> 5166.28
and officially the people wouldn't

5163.96 --> 5169.119
recognize it a lot of people even in the

5166.28 --> 5171.719
Catholic Church were like against it

5169.119 --> 5174.719
they just thought Jesuits are a bunch of

5171.719 --> 5174.719
weirdo

5175.159 --> 5181.92
Wizards that lion they contrast in what

5178.48 --> 5183.239
just what like the Bible teaches etc etc

5181.92 --> 5186.119
and they

5183.239 --> 5189.5199999999995
were right but the church didn't

5186.119 --> 5192.92
persecute them that's total

5189.52 --> 5196.040000000001
nonsense they were the church they were

5192.92 --> 5198.719
the other tier they were the the ruling

5196.04 --> 5202.719
tier that was literally there for the

5198.719 --> 5204.199
power of the church and the common folk

5202.719 --> 5208.08
had their

5204.199 --> 5210.199
own ideas and they had yeah Jesuits had

5208.08 --> 5213.28
no respect for that at

5210.199 --> 5216.08
all they were there to mind control

5213.28 --> 5219.159
everybody and in the the 20th century

5216.08 --> 5222.159
Teraria was already fallen the

5219.159 --> 5225.5199999999995
new the new countries the new nations

5222.159 --> 5228.638999999999
were reformed out of it the last of the

5225.52 --> 5232.040000000001
true big Imperial opponents of the

5228.639 --> 5235.36
Jesuits were defeated with the fall of

5232.04 --> 5238.88
tartaria and so in the 20th century they

5235.36 --> 5240.799999999999
could start to actually introduce the

5238.88 --> 5243.36
globe Earth

5240.8 --> 5245.56
cosmology Evolution had already been

5243.36 --> 5249.199
maneuvered in

5245.56 --> 5252.320000000001
for a bit wasn't being taught though in

5249.199 --> 5256.36
school but yeah alongside the globe

5252.32 --> 5259.48
cosmology this was the new way the new

5256.36 --> 5263.04
science Earth is a globe

5259.48 --> 5265.5599999999995
and an evolution happened and then even

5263.04 --> 5268.239
like halfway the 20th

5265.56 --> 5271.96
century on top of that the Big Bang

5268.239 --> 5277.48
Theory from a Jesuit

5271.96 --> 5277.4800000000005
officially as like the the cherry on

5279.32 --> 5283.759999999999
top and that's how that all came to

5291.88 --> 5297.32
be that's my I'll be right

5303.119 --> 5306.119
back

5333.04 --> 5336.04
for

5363.04 --> 5366.04
e

5372.02 --> 5375.099
[Music]

5377.39 --> 5383.04
[Music]

5380.119 --> 5383.04
quite hungry by

5383.159 --> 5388.96
now right so this is what I like to see

5388.08 --> 5392.88
my

5388.96 --> 5395.4
chat not a bunch of nonsense waffle but

5392.88 --> 5398.28
people that are Act

5395.4 --> 5400.799999999999
talking mostly wrenches about a really

5398.28 --> 5400.8
serious

5401.6 --> 5404.749000000001
[Music]

5406.04 --> 5413.0
subject you think Duke nuk yeah no

5410.8 --> 5417.2390000000005
duh d

5413.0 --> 5419.88
wrong V could I mean it

5417.239 --> 5422.959999999999
was kind of

5419.88 --> 5425.96
like nonsense

5422.96 --> 5425.96
though

5432.8 --> 5438.679
like in the Dan Brown novel like that's

5436.28 --> 5441.5599999999995
what they show is

5438.679 --> 5445.04
like

5441.56 --> 5448.280000000001
cultists what that the cultist Assassin

5445.04 --> 5448.28
arms of the

5448.84 --> 5453.04
Jesuits that's who people then get to

5451.239 --> 5455.919999999999
know because yeah it's all about mind

5453.04 --> 5455.92
control

5457.04 --> 5463.679
right that's the whole entire thing

5459.96 --> 5467.44
about the Jesuit order it's all about

5463.679 --> 5470.04
mind control and what we get presented

5467.44 --> 5473.96
with are the Assassins that they're

5470.04 --> 5477.04
trying to reduce Jesuits even with with

5473.96 --> 5481.56
John Wick they're reducing the Jesuits

5477.04 --> 5484.239
to just being like criminal

5481.56 --> 5485.4800000000005
assassins when in reality the Jesuit it

5484.239 --> 5488.5199999999995
is

5485.48 --> 5490.879999999999
purely about mind

5488.52 --> 5493.1990000000005
control that's their entire purpose

5490.88 --> 5497.84
that's their entire

5493.199 --> 5502.32
role rewrite history devise

5497.84 --> 5507.400000000001
how entire peoples are

5502.32 --> 5510.119
taught and reverse everybody inside out

5507.4 --> 5512.759999999999
so that you'll still have Christians and

5510.119 --> 5515.4
the Christians will read their Bibles

5512.76 --> 5518.56
and as they read their bies they will

5515.4 --> 5521.759999999999
literally then say things about how to

5518.56 --> 5525.719
do things when that those teaching

5521.76 --> 5528.4400000000005
directly diametrically oppose what Jesus

5525.719 --> 5531.32
actually says in it yeah it's one of

5528.44 --> 5531.32
their Pinnacle

5532.08 --> 5537.5199999999995
accomplishments so Christians will now

5534.679 --> 5540.92
just teach and say things about the

5537.52 --> 5543.1990000000005
Bible reference hold on to things and

5540.92 --> 5546.28
fight for it when it's not even

5543.199 --> 5549.678999999999
mentioned in the Bible yeah there is no

5546.28 --> 5552.88
Trinity in the Bible yet Christians

5549.679 --> 5556.2390000000005
fight over that crap

5552.88 --> 5559.92
yeah Christians make statements about

5556.239 --> 5562.799999999999
how things are when Jesus directly

5559.92 --> 5566.52
contradicts those

5562.8 --> 5570.0
things so it's it's already like that's

5566.52 --> 5572.679
Jesuit designed they they needed it to

5570.0 --> 5574.88
be like that they needed Jesus to be in

5572.679 --> 5578.2390000000005
there to tell the truth and then

5574.88 --> 5582.0
everybody to fail to

5578.239 --> 5587.718999999999
fail accepting Jesus's

5582.0 --> 5590.239
words to make Humanity fail through mind

5587.719 --> 5593.4800000000005
control but they have to have Jesus in

5590.239 --> 5593.48
there it's like the

5593.719 --> 5601.199
original like it is related to Jesus in

5597.119 --> 5601.199
way they do recognize Jesus's

5601.48 --> 5606.879999999999
power they just want to take over mind

5604.48 --> 5611.239
control of entirety of humanity and they

5606.88 --> 5611.2390000000005
have to a very far

5617.39 --> 5620.56
[Music]

5626.08 --> 5630.0
extent D stop

5632.719 --> 5635.719
whining

5646.92 --> 5652.639
I got mad at you because you you asked

5649.84 --> 5655.56
about freaking fashion who the [ __ ]

5652.639 --> 5657.56
cares what Jesuits we duper we're not

5655.56 --> 5662.719
talking about that

5657.56 --> 5666.96
stop wanding off in menial

5662.719 --> 5672.04
distractions that is why I get angry you

5666.96 --> 5673.88
keep wandering off in nonsensical menial

5672.04 --> 5678.639
distractions

5673.88 --> 5678.639
stop or get the [ __ ] out of the

5689.04 --> 5695.76
class nobody [ __ ] cares why Jesuits

5693.8 --> 5698.320000000001
wear the clothes they do we're not

5695.76 --> 5701.1990000000005
talking about that it has no

5698.32 --> 5705.4
significance to the overall subject I'm

5701.199 --> 5710.32
putting down stop

5705.4 --> 5710.32
distracting away from the main

5722.639 --> 5725.639
line

5745.04 --> 5756.8
[Music]

5752.639 --> 5756.8
yeah CHS I don't

5757.8 --> 5763.4400000000005
know right but my point again that I was

5760.96 --> 5763.44
trying to

5765.719 --> 5773.159
make ah yeah this a fair enough clutch

5771.08 --> 5775.32
didn't need to do that but fair

5773.159 --> 5776.32
enough I was actually just going to kick

5775.32 --> 5781.36
him

5776.32 --> 5783.679
out 24 hours time out is kind of

5781.36 --> 5786.159
pointless it's what you do with people

5783.679 --> 5788.52
that you do actually want to keep

5786.159 --> 5791.08
around but you just don't want them on

5788.52 --> 5791.080000000001
the show

5792.639 --> 5798.6
currently no

5795.36 --> 5798.599999999999
worries no

5802.84 --> 5807.76
worries right what was I talking about

5805.48 --> 5812.5199999999995
all this [ __ ] distraction this is

5807.76 --> 5814.320000000001
this is what pisses me off that you do

5812.52 --> 5817.080000000001
that

5814.32 --> 5820.719
yeah your stupid inconsequential

5817.08 --> 5826.28
questions and [ __ ] it distract me this

5820.719 --> 5826.28
is a complicated subject it requires

5833.639 --> 5837.84
concentration what is it talking about

5838.4 --> 5843.599999999999
yeah my idea about the Bible how

5841.119 --> 5845.04
Christianity is what I call the

5843.6 --> 5848.159000000001
Antichrist

5845.04 --> 5851.04
Christianity where Christians are

5848.159 --> 5853.719
now taught things through the priesthood

5851.04 --> 5855.76
and through each other about things that

5853.719 --> 5859.04
aren't actually in the

5855.76 --> 5861.360000000001
Bible things like the Trinity and

5859.04 --> 5863.119
somebody earlier

5861.36 --> 5864.799999999999
mentioned

5863.119 --> 5867.4
about

5864.8 --> 5870.400000000001
John something I don't know what the

5867.4 --> 5874.5599999999995
hell that is if you could be more

5870.4 --> 5878.679
specific about it that would be great

5874.56 --> 5883.320000000001
what is it somebody mentions oh yeah

5878.679 --> 5886.52
john1 I don't know what that is look G

5883.32 --> 5889.159
but if you would like to spell it out

5886.52 --> 5892.159000000001
instead of

5889.159 --> 5892.159
just

5893.28 --> 5899.599
like a name and a code because I don't

5896.52 --> 5903.080000000001
know that I just know what I've paid

5899.599 --> 5906.04
attention to overall and that is that I

5903.08 --> 5909.5199999999995
really in the Bible it's like I ignore

5906.04 --> 5912.44
everything except for Jesus's

5909.52 --> 5915.159000000001
words I think that Jesus's words still

5912.44 --> 5918.119
come from a original

5915.159 --> 5922.159
Bible and that the rest around it has

5918.119 --> 5924.799999999999
been re Rewritten by I'm going to blame

5922.159 --> 5927.96
it on the Jesuits

5924.8 --> 5929.84
again but that the original words are

5927.96 --> 5932.44
still from the

5929.84 --> 5936.2390000000005
original testimony and

5932.44 --> 5939.28
Bible and so that Jesus's words contain

5936.239 --> 5942.879999999999
fractal implications that give you

5939.28 --> 5945.719
pointers and that show you if you

5942.88 --> 5948.8
actually like really focus in on them

5945.719 --> 5951.8
that everything that's being said that

5948.8 --> 5954.88
like even by other people in the Bible

5951.8 --> 5958.4800000000005
people like Paul and what other priests

5954.88 --> 5962.2390000000005
have said and concluded about the Bible

5958.48 --> 5965.04
is literally in contradiction to what

5962.239 --> 5968.839999999999
Jesus says

5965.04 --> 5971.679
and that's final and that's the entire

5968.84 --> 5975.52
vantage point of me with the Bible this

5971.679 --> 5975.52
that's why I say the things that I

5976.599 --> 5981.96
do they've created

5979.88 --> 5985.32
it so that

5981.96 --> 5988.119
people would declare Jesus a God even

5985.32 --> 5992.5599999999995
though he never claimed that and it is

5988.119 --> 5995.32
in direct violation of the laws of God

5992.56 --> 5997.119000000001
do all these things that are forbidden

5995.32 --> 6000.719
about

5997.119 --> 6004.5199999999995
Jesus and Jesus even like tries to tell

6000.719 --> 6008.119
you not to do it and then people even

6004.52 --> 6010.88
now thousands of years later still do it

6008.119 --> 6013.159
wrong and they could still figure out

6010.88 --> 6015.2390000000005
that they are doing it wrong they're

6013.159 --> 6018.92
just not figuring it out they're just

6015.239 --> 6022.598999999999
being coerced by group peer pressure

6018.92 --> 6025.639
nonsense about about mind dominating

6022.599 --> 6028.96
priests that want to just enforce the

6025.639 --> 6030.96
right way and the Little Riddles that

6028.96 --> 6033.52
will get you in heaven if you don't say

6030.96 --> 6035.84
the Little Riddles you go to hell all

6033.52 --> 6035.84
that

6037.76 --> 6042.96
nonsense and like all the most important

6040.639 --> 6044.92
thing is that he died for your sins and

6042.96 --> 6046.4800000000005
all that

6044.92 --> 6049.52
nonsense

6046.48 --> 6053.598999999999
yeah instead of actually listening to

6049.52 --> 6055.92
the wisdom that came out of his mouth

6053.599 --> 6059.2390000000005
that is written down in a special

6055.92 --> 6061.679
colored ink yeah this should tell you

6059.239 --> 6065.839999999999
something yeah I mean how many frecking

6061.679 --> 6070.84
books are out there in which a prominent

6065.84 --> 6073.84
figure their writing is in another ink

6070.84 --> 6076.2390000000005
yeah I don't know any other book that

6073.84 --> 6081.4800000000005
even does that it seems kind of

6076.239 --> 6085.959999999999
important yet people totally ignore

6081.48 --> 6090.759999999999
it Christians for Generations totally

6085.96 --> 6095.0
ignore it yeah that's extremely telling

6090.76 --> 6097.76
it tells me it's a gigantic mind control

6095.0 --> 6102.119
cult that worships somebody that tells

6097.76 --> 6103.76
them not to and ignores all their wisdom

6102.119 --> 6108.32
that's what that tells

6103.76 --> 6110.719
me and I'd say the Jesuits won they have

6108.32 --> 6113.28
complete mind control over the entire

6110.719 --> 6115.4800000000005
religion they completely turn everything

6113.28 --> 6117.84
everything inside out to the point where

6115.48 --> 6120.199
Christians are willing to [ __ ] to

6117.84 --> 6122.4800000000005
blatant satanic things that are

6120.199 --> 6124.119
happening out

6122.48 --> 6125.919999999999
there

6124.119 --> 6129.759999999999
to

6125.92 --> 6133.599
basically reinvite Sodom and gamorra

6129.76 --> 6137.56
even into the church yeah that's how far

6133.599 --> 6140.28
the Jesuits which are

6137.56 --> 6142.84
like probably the most satanic

6140.28 --> 6145.599
organization that has ever existed

6142.84 --> 6146.4800000000005
that's how far their mind control Power

6145.599 --> 6150.400000000001
has

6146.48 --> 6155.119
reached they turned everything inside

6150.4 --> 6155.119
out including Christianity

6162.66 --> 6166.679
[Music]

6164.28 --> 6168.92
itself yeah Jesus words are from the

6166.679 --> 6172.119
same book that is apparently altered

6168.92 --> 6174.96
yeah but they can't alter his

6172.119 --> 6177.239
words

6174.96 --> 6177.2390000000005
they

6183.48 --> 6189.159
can't if and why is that probably

6187.0 --> 6192.92
because there's something really magical

6189.159 --> 6196.4
about it if you try to alter the the

6192.92 --> 6199.76
words then the fractal effect the

6196.4 --> 6203.598999999999
fractal implications breaks up it

6199.76 --> 6206.719
becomes diluted and it curs es

6203.599 --> 6210.56
everything it just collapses it it won't

6206.719 --> 6214.119
work it will wither it won't stick it

6210.56 --> 6217.04
won't have the power of Jesus they try

6214.119 --> 6220.48
to encapsulate the power of Jesus which

6217.04 --> 6223.159
has real power his words have real real

6220.48 --> 6226.28
serious power and like fractal

6223.159 --> 6231.159
implications that are Eternal that will

6226.28 --> 6233.92
apply for all time at every age no

6231.159 --> 6236.32
matter what happens it will always

6233.92 --> 6240.639
retain an incredible

6236.32 --> 6241.639
value with every people in every era in

6240.639 --> 6244.400000000001
every

6241.639 --> 6247.52
situation right and they can't change it

6244.4 --> 6249.5199999999995
if they change it it crumbles and then

6247.52 --> 6251.4800000000005
the entire thing could just like totally

6249.52 --> 6253.360000000001
collapse in on itself including their

6251.48 --> 6257.32
mind control Power if they change

6253.36 --> 6261.199
Jesus's words it's like people would

6257.32 --> 6264.28
then be dispelled out of the monolithic

6261.199 --> 6266.48
mind control I think that the entire

6264.28 --> 6269.32
monolithic mind control of everything

6266.48 --> 6273.959999999999
that the Jesuits have done is because

6269.32 --> 6278.239
they all rested on top of the actual

6273.96 --> 6280.719
holy speech of Jesus so that that is the

6278.239 --> 6283.5599999999995
one thing that they could never

6280.719 --> 6285.04
change they can change everything in the

6283.56 --> 6289.2390000000005
world

6285.04 --> 6289.239
everything but not the

6290.119 --> 6297.32
words there might be some like act ual

6293.719 --> 6297.32
serious magic to

6299.719 --> 6307.8
this this is how I see it this is what I

6303.08 --> 6309.76
believe and this is just how it seems to

6307.8 --> 6313.76
be working

6309.76 --> 6316.76
like otherwise why the hell would they

6313.76 --> 6319.96
not change the words why would they not

6316.76 --> 6322.599
literally say make Jesus say like oh

6319.96 --> 6326.84
yeah I am the Trinity I am the godhead

6322.599 --> 6330.28
like yeah but he didn't say that yeah he

6326.84 --> 6333.679
didn't and he hasn't it's been just

6330.28 --> 6337.44
popularly pushed on everybody and the

6333.679 --> 6339.08
people retain that Priestly tradition

6337.44 --> 6342.839999999999
that's not in the

6339.08 --> 6346.199
Bible yeah and I think that that is part

6342.84 --> 6349.92
of the Mind Control and it's better like

6346.199 --> 6351.04
they can't touch Jesus's words like that

6349.92 --> 6353.92
would

6351.04 --> 6358.4
actually potentially dest destroy the

6353.92 --> 6361.0
Mind Control magic but they could just

6358.4 --> 6364.799999999999
convince people through lies through

6361.0 --> 6367.679
seduction and lies and arrogance like

6364.8 --> 6370.84
implant arrogance within the people

6367.679 --> 6373.159
within the priesthood that they could

6370.84 --> 6375.28
just like regard it differently have

6373.159 --> 6377.239
different ideas and those ideas would

6375.28 --> 6380.5199999999995
then contrast with

6377.239 --> 6383.44
Jesus but people would still do

6380.52 --> 6386.1990000000005
it so that they think think they're

6383.44 --> 6388.919999999999
followers of Christ but they're just

6386.199 --> 6391.879999999999
putting him on a pedestal in a cage and

6388.92 --> 6393.32
not listening to him not actually

6391.88 --> 6394.92
understanding what he

6393.32 --> 6398.119
says

6394.92 --> 6402.08
worshiping a figure that they have

6398.119 --> 6402.08
alienated themselves to

6404.28 --> 6410.84
utterly that's what I think this

6407.88 --> 6410.84
Christianity

6411.84 --> 6414.84
is

6416.16 --> 6419.29
[Music]

6419.48 --> 6426.32
right anyway so that's how that ties in

6423.199 --> 6426.32
with the

6428.48 --> 6433.759999999999
Jesuits right and that's why I always

6431.0 --> 6435.92
say like I literally ignore everything

6433.76 --> 6439.639
everything everybody says about the

6435.92 --> 6442.4800000000005
Bible about Jesus even within the book I

6439.639 --> 6443.400000000001
just I just care about what did Jesus

6442.48 --> 6446.5599999999995
say

6443.4 --> 6449.04
like what did he literally say I don't

6446.56 --> 6451.080000000001
care about your opinions about it don't

6449.04 --> 6454.119
care about your interpretations I just

6451.08 --> 6456.96
want to hear what he literally said that

6454.119 --> 6460.28
is all like that's the only thing I

6456.96 --> 6463.639
actually care about somebody says like

6460.28 --> 6467.4
what you're doing right now is like

6463.639 --> 6471.2390000000005
offensive to Jesus I'll be like oh [ __ ]

6467.4 --> 6473.719
really what can you please clarify that

6471.239 --> 6478.5599999999995
like can you please tell me exactly L

6473.719 --> 6481.159
how like quote him and then I will like

6478.56 --> 6486.2390000000005
yeld I will yeld to

6481.159 --> 6488.119
that if I am like provably going against

6486.239 --> 6493.759999999999
Jesus's

6488.119 --> 6498.719
declarations then yeah I will yield but

6493.76 --> 6498.719
only to that only to

6500.199 --> 6506.48
that yeah and not any other context

6503.84 --> 6510.32
that's draped alongside that by the

6506.48 --> 6510.32
individual and whatever they

6510.92 --> 6516.96
want anyway I'm going to start taking a

6513.8 --> 6520.320000000001
bite out of my Illuminati C

6516.96 --> 6520.32
cheers I am

6531.719 --> 6534.719
hungry

6538.32 --> 6542.799999999999
isn't everything blah blah blah yeah I

6539.92 --> 6545.719
don't care I don't care look good part

6542.8 --> 6545.719
it doesn't matter to

6549.639 --> 6556.1990000000005
me as far as I'm concerned the entire

6552.599 --> 6557.76
Bible is completely

6556.199 --> 6561.239
Rewritten

6557.76 --> 6564.679
locations and individuals have been

6561.239 --> 6568.839999999999
changed it's not the original

6564.679 --> 6568.84
Bible but his

6569.04 --> 6576.92
words had to

6571.96 --> 6579.96
be exactly the original words that's

6576.92 --> 6579.96
what I say about

6591.639 --> 6596.400000000001
it

6594.36 --> 6599.88
oh exactly clutch now you're getting it

6596.4 --> 6603.0
oh total solipsistic reversal nothing is

6599.88 --> 6605.119
real yeah get the [ __ ] out of here

6603.0 --> 6608.32
like

6605.119 --> 6609.92
yeah yeah oh so nothing is real well

6608.32 --> 6612.119
then get the [ __ ] out of here then

6609.92 --> 6618.04
nothing means anything and anything I've

6612.119 --> 6621.4
said won't mean anything to you so just

6618.04 --> 6624.639
get and go entertain yourself in this

6621.4 --> 6624.638999999999
meaningless world then

6635.82 --> 6640.49
[Music]

6643.99 --> 6647.08
[Music]

6651.639 --> 6654.639

6659.28 --> 6666.239
yeah who cares orble nobody [ __ ]

6662.56 --> 6669.400000000001
cares that Jesus didn't write it down

6666.239 --> 6673.0
himself nobody [ __ ]

6669.4 --> 6673.0
cares it's not

6676.36 --> 6683.0
relevant the

6678.44 --> 6686.04
wisdom the immutable Immortal wisdom

6683.0 --> 6686.92
within the words is the only thing that

6686.04 --> 6691.079
is

6686.92 --> 6691.079
relevant and if you can't see

6692.239 --> 6699.718999999999
them it's because you're not willing to

6694.679 --> 6702.4
see it or you're not capable you're too

6699.719 --> 6704.599
obstructed too punished to be able to

6702.4 --> 6704.598999999999
see

6710.04 --> 6714.5199999999995

6814.599 --> 6818.639
considering your position

6820.34 --> 6823.439
[Music]

6828.76 --> 6833.1990000000005
philosophically yeah right K yeah thanks

6831.639 --> 6836.400000000001
for being here it's been been

6833.199 --> 6842.04
intense but interesting good to have a

6836.4 --> 6844.96
lot of wrenches actually being active

6842.04 --> 6849.639
again all I have to do is basically just

6844.96 --> 6854.599
kind of like squash all the Superfluous

6849.639 --> 6856.119
troll nonsense out of the way your petty

6854.599 --> 6858.639
distractions

6856.119 --> 6861.36
yeah it's annoying enough that you use

6858.639 --> 6864.88
all these Patty distractions to distract

6861.36 --> 6866.239
yourself but don't you [ __ ] dare

6864.88 --> 6868.84
distract

6866.239 --> 6871.678999999999
me when I'm actually putting down

6868.84 --> 6871.679
something real

6872.56 --> 6878.8
yeah in school when somebody does that

6876.56 --> 6881.8
in class when a teacher is rolling out

6878.8 --> 6883.639
something very serious you get sent to

6881.8 --> 6886.0
the

6883.639 --> 6890.719
principal yeah and if you then keep

6886.0 --> 6890.719
doing that you get sent

6891.32 --> 6897.32
home because you're literally disrupting

6894.719 --> 6899.96
class with your nonsense when you do

6897.32 --> 6899.96
that

6920.079 --> 6925.36
yeah atheist will

6923.079 --> 6925.36
oh

6926.28 --> 6932.4
really I would know why an atheist would

6928.96 --> 6932.4
want to watch that movie at

6944.04 --> 6950.639
all and to be

6946.48 --> 6950.638999999999
fair I don't really like that

6951.239 --> 6954.239
movie

6955.04 --> 6961.8
cuz to be fair I don't think that Jesus

6959.44 --> 6964.799999999999
died I'm

6961.8 --> 6964.8
sorry

6965.48 --> 6972.638999999999
yeah I'm really really siding with

6969.28 --> 6975.759999999999
Muslims on that one I am the more time

6972.639 --> 6978.599
passes the more I'm siding with Muslims

6975.76 --> 6980.2390000000005
and the more I find myself having to

6978.599 --> 6984.28
defend

6980.239 --> 6988.678999999999
Islam from all these disgusting

6984.28 --> 6990.96
judgmental projecting horeshit

6988.679 --> 6995.639
Christians that call

6990.96 --> 6997.92
any crazy deranged Refugee that just had

6995.639 --> 7003.4800000000005
that just says they're Muslim or that

6997.92 --> 7005.599
has this habit of praying for Allah

7003.48 --> 7007.48
supposedly and then say Oh that's

7005.599 --> 7010.400000000001
Muslims oh they're all

7007.48 --> 7013.28
criminals yeah they're just projecting

7010.4 --> 7017.719
yeah there's plenty of osed Christians

7013.28 --> 7017.719
that are really vile disgusting

7022.119 --> 7029.36
criminals I find myself being more

7026.52 --> 7033.52
agitated by all the whining

7029.36 --> 7036.079
and projecting onto Islam all these

7033.52 --> 7041.159000000001
supposed criminals that are

7036.079 --> 7045.159
obviously not with God not with

7041.159 --> 7047.92
Allah and that are

7045.159 --> 7050.5599999999995
just deranged people that would be

7047.92 --> 7053.52
incarcerated potentially executed in

7050.56 --> 7053.52
actual Islamic

7054.88 --> 7058.159000000001
[Music]

7056.079 --> 7061.44
countries so

7058.159 --> 7065.159
yeah I think Islam is more truthful

7061.44 --> 7065.159
about Christianity than all of

7068.4 --> 7072.759999999999
Christianity Jesus didn't die that not

7071.0 --> 7074.52
contradict the SI why is it God's

7072.76 --> 7076.360000000001
forgiveness yeah because I think it's

7074.52 --> 7077.96
total

7076.36 --> 7081.799999999999
horeshit

7077.96 --> 7081.8
yeah the [ __ ] you mean

7089.28 --> 7092.639
forgiveness it's

7094.52 --> 7097.569
[Music]

7097.719 --> 7102.679
[ __ ] nothing about it makes sense

7100.44 --> 7105.5599999999995
it's an esoteric clust

7102.679 --> 7105.56
[ __ ] of a

7111.639 --> 7117.84
statement hard forgiven for your

7114.44 --> 7117.839999999999
sins what

7122.199 --> 7128.839999999999
sins why did Jesus come in the first

7124.52 --> 7133.639
place to share the real wisdom the way

7128.84 --> 7138.360000000001
through to make you snap out of it out

7133.639 --> 7143.1990000000005
of the Demonic reality and the Demonic

7138.36 --> 7148.4
addictions yeah that's why to teach

7143.199 --> 7149.638999999999
you to be a revealer of the Middle Road

7148.4 --> 7152.079
the way

7149.639 --> 7158.1990000000005
through the true

7152.079 --> 7161.04
path yeah not to be some [ __ ] shter

7158.199 --> 7164.0
Slaughter some Slaughter

7161.04 --> 7166.48
sheep

7164.0 --> 7170.44
which is literally like that's directly

7166.48 --> 7173.0
out of the Playbook of pagan evil Gods

7170.44 --> 7174.879999999999
yeah oh you make a blood sacrifice oh

7173.0 --> 7177.199
everything is all right yeah sound

7174.88 --> 7181.599
familiar sound familiar really that that

7177.199 --> 7184.0
is what Jesus did yeah he just needed to

7181.599 --> 7186.8
be sacrificed like a a little child for

7184.0 --> 7190.0
molac oh really oh oh that's his

7186.8 --> 7193.719
function no no no I think that that is

7190.0 --> 7196.04
all slanderous crap it's all evil

7193.719 --> 7199.119
[ __ ] mind control and people are

7196.04 --> 7201.32
[ __ ] enough to accept it that's what

7199.119 --> 7201.32
I

7201.599 --> 7208.0
think

7204.04 --> 7211.0
yeah the proof in him being the Messiah

7208.0 --> 7213.52
lies in the quality of his

7211.0 --> 7216.76
words and his teachings that are

7213.52 --> 7216.76
immutable and

7218.199 --> 7225.678999999999
Timeless that is the proof not some

7222.36 --> 7229.36
[ __ ] Riddle That a bunch of deranged

7225.679 --> 7231.639
people with mind control obsessions made

7229.36 --> 7234.36
up about him yeah oh you have to say

7231.639 --> 7237.159000000001
this riddle oh or you're going to

7234.36 --> 7239.5199999999995
hell what you have to just chant some

7237.159 --> 7243.04
ridiculous nonsensical

7239.52 --> 7245.360000000001
thing or you don't go to the nice place

7243.04 --> 7245.93
sounds like a [ __ ] mind control call

7245.36 --> 7247.239
to

7245.93 --> 7248.84
[Music]

7247.239 --> 7253.44
me

7248.84 --> 7258.639
yeah I don't buy into that [ __ ]

7253.44 --> 7258.638999999999
because I'm not a weak willed pathetic

7280.92 --> 7283.92
[ __ ]

7286.44 --> 7289.119
the's

7290.0 --> 7295.599
videos yeah du doesn't really get it

7292.56 --> 7298.1990000000005
fully either he has some interesting

7295.599 --> 7302.159000000001
criticism but his conclusions are kind

7298.199 --> 7302.159
of luciferian it's like

7303.44 --> 7308.44
palpable if I watch his videos for too

7306.079 --> 7309.96
long I literally like

7308.44 --> 7312.44
get

7309.96 --> 7314.679
cursed I have to then like apply the

7312.44 --> 7315.839999999999
technique to myself to get get rid of

7314.679 --> 7318.119
the

7315.84 --> 7320.56
influences there's something weird and

7318.119 --> 7322.719
luciferian about what he talks about and

7320.56 --> 7326.079000000001
his

7322.719 --> 7328.32
opinions right and so I'm not agnostic I

7326.079 --> 7333.28
am not this and that I am all about

7328.32 --> 7336.32
logic and about One Singular

7333.28 --> 7341.5599999999995
absolute esoteric statement and that is

7336.32 --> 7343.5599999999995
God is truth Satan is lies and that is

7341.56 --> 7345.079000000001
all that matters and there's no

7343.56 --> 7348.1990000000005
supplement to that

7345.079 --> 7351.159
statement that is exactly what it is and

7348.199 --> 7356.199
so if something does not make sense if

7351.159 --> 7359.4
something is illogical then it must be a

7356.199 --> 7361.719
lie and it is better to know that you

7359.4 --> 7364.04
know absolutely nothing and that what

7361.719 --> 7366.32
you took for granted are just lies and

7364.04 --> 7370.4
there's nothing to replace it with than

7366.32 --> 7374.28
to accept something that is logically a

7370.4 --> 7376.719
lie better to to know absolutely nothing

7374.28 --> 7379.119
to realize that you are totally ignorant

7376.719 --> 7382.599
and that everything you thought was a

7379.119 --> 7387.679
lie rather than figuring out something

7382.599 --> 7393.4400000000005
is a lie and still accepting it yeah God

7387.679 --> 7393.4400000000005
is truth Satan is lies and that is

7395.54 --> 7398.76
[Music]

7400.76 --> 7403.76
all

7410.84 --> 7415.639
the Gnostic I don't give a [ __ ] what it

7412.96 --> 7418.599
is I don't I don't even know

7415.639 --> 7420.719
gnosticism yeah I figured this out I

7418.599 --> 7422.559
didn't figure this out by reading it

7420.719 --> 7426.32
from any

7422.559 --> 7428.52
book I don't care where it comes from

7426.32 --> 7431.799999999999
it's an esoteric statement that came out

7428.52 --> 7434.599
of me the idea came to me not through

7431.8 --> 7439.159000000001
through anyone through anyone else

7434.599 --> 7443.4800000000005
through a book nobody taught me that I

7439.159 --> 7446.159
figured it out eclectic

7443.48 --> 7448.0
me I don't give a [ __ ] if you call it

7446.159 --> 7451.679
Gnostic or whatever the [ __ ] you're

7448.0 --> 7454.599
going to call it this is my guideline

7451.679 --> 7456.8
and is absolute I will not be dissuaded

7454.599 --> 7458.119000000001
and I'll die for it even though I never

7456.8 --> 7460.719
will need

7458.119 --> 7463.719
to cuz what are you going to

7460.719 --> 7463.719
do

7469.49 --> 7472.719999999999
[Music]

7473.239 --> 7477.839999999999
nothing yeah yeah yeah whatever man I

7476.52 --> 7480.1990000000005
don't give a [ __ ] what you're going to

7477.84 --> 7484.079
call it CU shove it up your

7480.199 --> 7487.199
ass I know what I know and nobody and

7484.079 --> 7490.0
their blabber mouth nonsense and

7487.199 --> 7492.36
accusations is going to tell me anything

7490.0 --> 7495.76
yeah you can call me the anti Christ for

7492.36 --> 7495.759999999999
all I care I don't give a

7502.199 --> 7505.919999999999
[ __ ] yeah you're out of

7515.68 --> 7520.21
[Music]

7520.639 --> 7526.119
here I don't think he I don't care what

7523.48 --> 7527.119
the [ __ ] he thinks he does or is I don't

7526.119 --> 7529.88
give a

7527.119 --> 7532.5199999999995
[ __ ] they can all accuse me of whatever

7529.88 --> 7535.96
they like I don't

7532.52 --> 7538.360000000001
care I don't care if I'm like the guy

7535.96 --> 7540.92
that everybody's like oh it's the one

7538.36 --> 7543.799999999999
Antichrist guy he's the only one that

7540.92 --> 7547.28
doesn't recite the [ __ ] riddle he's

7543.8 --> 7549.679
going to go to hell well good yeah in

7547.28 --> 7552.199
your minds I'm going to go to hell in

7549.679 --> 7555.639
the meantime I'm going to go hold on

7552.199 --> 7559.119
to the absolute immutable truth that God

7555.639 --> 7561.599
is truth and Satan is lies and I don't

7559.119 --> 7563.96
give a [ __ ] what any of you have to say

7561.599 --> 7563.96
about

7571.37 --> 7581.119
[Music]

7577.76 --> 7584.1990000000005
that I think that anybody that holds on

7581.119 --> 7588.04
to a lie because they think they can get

7584.199 --> 7590.919999999999
something out of it they all go to

7588.04 --> 7593.48
hell and they know it and they're hiding

7590.92 --> 7593.4800000000005
it from

7593.8 --> 7601.52
themselves yeah cuz that's what Earthly

7597.0 --> 7603.88
people do people that do not worship the

7601.52 --> 7606.88
god that is not of this world but they

7603.88 --> 7611.079
worship the dirt they get something out

7606.88 --> 7613.04
of the lies the Satan lying to

7611.079 --> 7614.799999999999
themselves

7613.04 --> 7618.079
that's what they

7614.8 --> 7620.400000000001
do yeah you believe in a nonsense riddle

7618.079 --> 7622.5199999999995
why because otherwise people will tell

7620.4 --> 7625.44
you you go to hell you're not part of

7622.52 --> 7628.4400000000005
them oh that sounds like an Earthly

7625.44 --> 7628.44
priority doesn't

7629.679 --> 7638.159
it I'll hold on to immutable

7633.36 --> 7641.88
esoteric facts instead opposing everyone

7638.159 --> 7645.598999999999
and everything as I go forever I don't

7641.88 --> 7648.04
give a [ __ ] yeah I've been opposed by

7645.599 --> 7652.159000000001
people all my life I've been excluded

7648.04 --> 7655.88
from groups all my life all the time

7652.159 --> 7658.558999999999
continually pushed around dragged around

7655.88 --> 7660.8
people trying to manipulate me all over

7658.559 --> 7663.599
the place my entire [ __ ] life since I

7660.8 --> 7667.159000000001
was like five yeah you think I give a

7663.599 --> 7669.719
[ __ ] that I don't fit your stupid

7667.159 --> 7669.719
nonsense

7670.44 --> 7678.48
riddles I don't want to be part of your

7675.84 --> 7682.559
nonsense yeah I'd rather in the

7678.48 --> 7685.558999999999
afterlife be one single individual in a

7682.559 --> 7688.679
void with nobody else because everybody

7685.559 --> 7691.360000000001
else all wanted to pile on to the

7688.679 --> 7694.0
nonsense so that you can all

7691.36 --> 7696.839999999999
collectively billions of you you can all

7694.0 --> 7699.159
rot in hell with your [ __ ] lies

7696.84 --> 7702.639
thinking you done the right thing yeah

7699.159 --> 7705.389999999999
I'll hold on to that absolute truth

7702.639 --> 7708.549
even if it I'm the only one that does

7705.39 --> 7708.549
[Music]

7712.65 --> 7719.44
[Music]

7715.0 --> 7719.44
it and I'm not the only one that does

7721.8 --> 7727.0
it but even if I were I'd still do

7730.44 --> 7734.32
it

7733.159 --> 7736.879999999999
yeah that's a good statement there

7734.32 --> 7736.88
debatable

7758.679 --> 7766.32
D it's been very Rowdy today

7763.159 --> 7769.558999999999
but it needed it needed to be like that

7766.32 --> 7769.558999999999
and they needed to put this

7779.44 --> 7785.558999999999
down all right and again I'd like to

7782.8 --> 7788.76
reemphasize from the earlier part of the

7785.559 --> 7792.079000000001
show that Jesuits are really not

7788.76 --> 7794.1990000000005
threatened by Flat Earth at all they're

7792.079 --> 7795.799999999999
just not threatened by

7794.199 --> 7798.638999999999
it

7795.8 --> 7800.1990000000005
because they've already mastered the

7798.639 --> 7802.8
globe

7800.199 --> 7806.839999999999
religion they they created the The

7802.8 --> 7810.88
Logical hell so that any globber no

7806.84 --> 7812.679
matter what happens could always sustain

7810.88 --> 7815.84
their Globe belief no matter what

7812.679 --> 7817.639
happens no matter if logic itself just

7815.84 --> 7820.639
flips Inside

7817.639 --> 7823.1990000000005
Out they've mastered these systems they

7820.639 --> 7826.1990000000005
gave the example examples and so there

7823.199 --> 7828.48
is no threat of a full dispel of global

7826.199 --> 7830.719
religion no matter what

7828.48 --> 7832.718999999999
happens and in that sense there will

7830.719 --> 7836.119
always be a globe

7832.719 --> 7839.84
religion always a cult that will never

7836.119 --> 7842.4
go away as long as there are any form of

7839.84 --> 7844.4400000000005
teachings about how the globe works or

7842.4 --> 7846.799999999999
is supposed to work there will be a

7844.44 --> 7846.799999999999
globe

7847.0 --> 7851.639
religion and I don't think there's going

7848.92 --> 7853.84
to be any time soon where well going to

7851.639 --> 7855.96
go around the world and erase everything

7853.84 --> 7859.4800000000005
that is Globe religion like you see that

7855.96 --> 7861.719
happening I don't I don't at all rather

7859.48 --> 7863.44
the opposite right I mean they've been

7861.719 --> 7864.88
in control for so long they're not

7863.44 --> 7867.759999999999
definitely not going to have that

7864.88 --> 7870.1990000000005
exactly 180 degrees the other direction

7867.76 --> 7870.1990000000005
there's no

7873.96 --> 7881.8
way right so Jesuits are not threatened

7878.199 --> 7884.44
by the globe religion because they can

7881.8 --> 7886.360000000001
maintain Globe religion for all eternity

7884.44 --> 7889.28
for as long as they are around and

7886.36 --> 7891.92
there's the globe teachings around to

7889.28 --> 7891.92
hand the globe

7892.559 --> 7896.92
Believers they're not threatened by Flat

7894.92 --> 7898.52
Earth not

7896.92 --> 7901.0
really

7898.52 --> 7904.2390000000005
because they just

7901.0 --> 7907.8
weaponized the globe excuses to to

7904.239 --> 7910.239
absurd degrees that go Way Beyond even

7907.8 --> 7914.52
the political mind control

7910.239 --> 7916.239
level so that's what that is and what is

7914.52 --> 7921.400000000001
much more threatening to

7916.239 --> 7925.759999999999
Jesuits is the popping up of

7921.4 --> 7930.159
history that doesn't match and reveals

7925.76 --> 7933.679
the mismatch with the Jesuit recreated

7930.159 --> 7935.96
history their history that is much more

7933.679 --> 7939.679
of a threat to the Jesuits than Flat

7935.96 --> 7942.119
Earth way bigger because the damage is

7939.679 --> 7944.119
much more heavy

7942.119 --> 7946.119
yeah if you figure out the Earth is flat

7944.119 --> 7949.44
it's like pretty cool you can learn how

7946.119 --> 7952.0
it is flat but then you bump into balard

7949.44 --> 7954.28
religious idiots that will just keep

7952.0 --> 7955.679
making excuses on oh how it's still a

7954.28 --> 7958.32
ball no matter

7955.679 --> 7960.96
what with the alternative history

7958.32 --> 7963.44
however there's open ends and there's

7960.96 --> 7966.159
like locations that are like officially

7963.44 --> 7969.32
don't exist anymore there's Mysteries

7966.159 --> 7972.44
there's a lot of pull there's like a

7969.32 --> 7975.119
pole to it like you want to you want to

7972.44 --> 7977.759999999999
know you secretly with everybody else

7975.119 --> 7981.839999999999
that has gotten this H you want the

7977.76 --> 7984.559
original history back don't you the full

7981.84 --> 7987.4400000000005
picture before the Jesuits started to

7984.559 --> 7990.2390000000005
rewrite everything and erase stuff you

7987.44 --> 7994.4
secretly want that wouldn't you even if

7990.239 --> 7995.718999999999
it like requires another 200 years to

7994.4 --> 8000.119
put it all

7995.719 --> 8002.04
together you and I really want that real

8000.119 --> 8006.04
history

8002.04 --> 8009.92
that they've erased and that's out that

8006.04 --> 8013.28
dream is out and it's not you can't stop

8009.92 --> 8016.4400000000005
it you can't just like pacify it you

8013.28 --> 8019.0
can't neutralize it people want that and

8016.44 --> 8021.839999999999
they will hold on to it and in the

8019.0 --> 8024.36
future people will potentially die to

8021.84 --> 8024.360000000001
accomplish

8025.239 --> 8030.759999999999
it and that is something that Jesuit the

8029.0 --> 8033.04
Jesuit order and their overall mind

8030.76 --> 8034.96
control plans are much more afraid of

8033.04 --> 8037.76
than whether the Earth is flat and

8034.96 --> 8037.76
people know about

8046.199 --> 8049.96
it wow somebody's

8052.92 --> 8058.04
bored yeah that's not my problem

8060.04 --> 8063.04
though

8073.93 --> 8079.200000000001
[Music]

8086.84 --> 8093.04
right we have questions Danny shakes

8090.599 --> 8093.04
cool

8093.639 --> 8101.639
well maybe another

8096.92 --> 8101.639
time but I'm always open to answer

8115.88 --> 8123.2390000000005
questions yes blue for the evolution

8118.28 --> 8123.239
just don't just ignore him who gives as

8149.92 --> 8152.92
[ __ ]

8158.48 --> 8165.32
go out of his way yeah and so I mean

8163.28 --> 8168.92
he's just whining and whining and

8165.32 --> 8171.679
whining and it's just everybody keeps

8168.92 --> 8173.28
tolerating it yeah it's their problem

8171.679 --> 8176.92
it's not my

8173.28 --> 8179.92
problem his behavior is not my problem

8176.92 --> 8182.119
anymore cuz I'm not going to go back

8179.92 --> 8184.88
there

8182.119 --> 8187.96
pretty much under any condition at this

8184.88 --> 8190.159000000001
point I'm not part of the group anymore

8187.96 --> 8194.08
I'm not going to participate in group

8190.159 --> 8195.679
dynamics with them under pretty much any

8194.08 --> 8198.2
circumstances

8195.679 --> 8200.679
conceivable I might talk to individuals

8198.2 --> 8203.319000000001
from the group I'm not going to be in

8200.679 --> 8205.76
the group anymore

8203.319 --> 8208.599
ever because it's

8205.76 --> 8211.599
toxic they're totally

8208.599 --> 8214.24
deaf to information they don't listen

8211.599 --> 8216.559
when they're in a group at all and they

8214.24 --> 8219.119999999999
have obsessive compulsive

8216.559 --> 8221.719
behavior and I don't want to be part of

8219.12 --> 8221.719000000001
that ever

8234.519 --> 8238.24
again well Jensen

8238.599 --> 8245.0
flatfoot it's way better off for you

8241.76 --> 8246.519
yeah it is and I mean I'm having a great

8245.0 --> 8249.359
show today aren't

8246.519 --> 8253.24
I despite me yelling a little bit

8249.359 --> 8254.639000000001
because people are just sloppy and just

8253.24 --> 8258.399
ruining the

8254.639 --> 8259.518999999998
flow like I'm doing great I'm very happy

8258.399 --> 8262.199999999999
with my

8259.519 --> 8267.16
show and the way that I'm feeling now

8262.2 --> 8270.28
it's like oh I've only done 1900 shows

8267.16 --> 8276.2
huh I think I could definitely go for

8270.28 --> 8276.2
another and maybe another

8276.639 --> 8281.759999999998
1,400 at this point I'm like yeah I I

8279.519 --> 8284.679
could go on for like at least another

8281.76 --> 8284.679
five years no

8285.439 --> 8290.76
problem

8287.76 --> 8294.08
right wonder if they can say that as

8290.76 --> 8294.08
well over

8299.76 --> 8304.559000000001
there

8302.359 --> 8306.76
and I'm feeling more healthy I am

8304.559 --> 8309.438999999998
measurably strengthening I'm getting

8306.76 --> 8314.08
more focused I'm getting more stable I'm

8309.439 --> 8314.08
getting thicker skin against [ __ ]

8316.639 --> 8323.24
trolls I

8319.479 --> 8326.399
am getting a lot of things about my own

8323.24 --> 8329.719
experiences cleared up about a lot of

8326.399 --> 8332.399
surreal things in my life that I don't

8329.719 --> 8336.119999999999
really want to open talk about that

8332.399 --> 8338.96
much but people that I've had private

8336.12 --> 8340.960000000001
conversations with do know what I'm

8338.96 --> 8345.199999999999
talking about and I'm getting just

8340.96 --> 8345.199999999999
cleared up about a lot of things in my

8345.28 --> 8352.519
life and I'm getting better at what I do

8348.359 --> 8355.519
I'm quicker my memory works better I can

8352.519 --> 8356.479
read now without getting distracted from

8355.519 --> 8359.399
what I'm

8356.479 --> 8362.639
reading these are things that are

8359.399 --> 8364.08
developing in my life

8362.639 --> 8367.08
relatively

8364.08 --> 8370.039999999999
recent and it makes me very enthusiastic

8367.08 --> 8370.039999999999
it makes me feel

8371.719 --> 8375.96
like it sounds weird but it makes me

8374.24 --> 8379.199999999999
kind of feel like

8375.96 --> 8380.559
adulthood like I've been a teenager for

8379.2 --> 8384.719000000001
like 40

8380.559 --> 8386.599
years or 30 years which is kind of weird

8384.719 --> 8387.759999999998
I'm going to like just throw it on like

8386.599 --> 8392.960000000001
yeah it's just

8387.76 --> 8395.68
the elves age at a different r or

8392.96 --> 8398.519999999999
something but I feel that I went through

8395.68 --> 8401.68
a a physical

8398.52 --> 8403.800000000001
change I keep emphasizing that it's not

8401.68 --> 8407.800000000001
just an attitude change it's a physical

8403.8 --> 8411.479
change I feel that I physically changed

8407.8 --> 8412.399
like perhaps some the way my brain works

8411.479 --> 8415.0
it

8412.399 --> 8418.88
changed measurably to me like I am

8415.0 --> 8421.479
noticing the difference and I'm very

8418.88 --> 8423.92
hopeful I'm very hopeful that I'll be

8421.479 --> 8425.76
capable of being a lot stronger in

8423.92 --> 8428.2
everything that I've already been

8425.76 --> 8430.84
doing and that I will find more

8428.2 --> 8434.240000000002
inspiration and more revitalizing

8430.84 --> 8434.24
energies in what I'm

8435.76 --> 8440.24
doing we become real adults when we

8438.439 --> 8444.28
retire uh

8440.24 --> 8444.28
okay sure

8446.12 --> 8449.640000000001
whatever don't know about that one

8448.2 --> 8452.640000000001
debatable

8449.64 --> 8452.64
d

8460.64 --> 8467.039999999999
but what I do know is

8463.24 --> 8469.359
that I'm all about the truth on a

8467.04 --> 8471.28
personal level there will be no more

8469.359 --> 8475.2
scheming and

8471.28 --> 8475.2
planning and there will be no

8475.399 --> 8483.399
more holding back to scheme and plan

8478.84 --> 8483.399
there will only be holding back to to

8487.84 --> 8492.52
protect will not violate anybody's

8492.68 --> 8499.08
trust not that I really

8495.84 --> 8502.399
have but all these like these good

8499.08 --> 8505.399
principles I am

8502.399 --> 8508.199999999999
more invigorated about them I am more

8505.399 --> 8510.88
determined to hold on to the good

8508.2 --> 8514.16
principles that I have tried to stand

8510.88 --> 8514.16
for for quite a

8529.319 --> 8534.84
while hey getting

8531.88 --> 8539.519999999999
wisdom that's inspiring

8534.84 --> 8542.52
good it certainly feels inspiring to

8539.52 --> 8542.52
me

8543.96 --> 8549.96
yeah and also like all these judgments

8546.439 --> 8553.960000000001
from stupid trolls and all that like oo

8549.96 --> 8556.24
balding elf o and like oh yeah my dad is

8553.96 --> 8558.919999999998
so embarrassed about yeah these people

8556.24 --> 8560.16
don't have absolutely no idea what

8558.92 --> 8564.76
they're talking

8560.16 --> 8568.72
about yeah my dad's really proud of me

8564.76 --> 8571.64
actually so like I've had ideas like oh

8568.72 --> 8574.24
my dad must be embarrassed about me

8571.64 --> 8576.84
because I am not like a fulltime I don't

8574.24 --> 8578.92
make a lot of money but like he doesn't

8576.84 --> 8581.56
give a [ __ ] about

8578.92 --> 8587.84
that like at

8581.56 --> 8587.84
all and he knows why I live the way I

8587.92 --> 8593.6
do he actually car cares a lot more

8591.2 --> 8596.640000000001
about my Spiritual Development and he

8593.6 --> 8601.12
has personal Ambitions in that direction

8596.64 --> 8604.88
even for himself at that age so my dad's

8601.12 --> 8607.92
growing increasingly more proud of me

8604.88 --> 8610.119999999999
and like I can hear that in his voice

8607.92 --> 8613.359
when I talk to him over the phone like

8610.12 --> 8618.240000000002
he has more energy he's like oh my

8613.359 --> 8620.6
son energy hope love genuine not

8618.24 --> 8620.6
something

8620.8 --> 8628.319
Force yeah so all that troll

8624.399 --> 8631.0
[ __ ] it there's only one conclusion I

8628.319 --> 8634.24
can draw from it

8631.0 --> 8636.6
realizing more about how my reality and

8634.24 --> 8639.16
my life really is and that is these

8636.6 --> 8643.04
trolls are all projecting this [ __ ] out

8639.16 --> 8646.399
of it they're just projecting their own

8643.04 --> 8648.800000000001
parents dissatisfaction with

8646.399 --> 8651.84
them on to

8648.8 --> 8654.759999999998
me their own parents are probably

8651.84 --> 8657.08
embarrassed about them and they might

8654.76 --> 8659.52
even be trying to like work really hard

8657.08 --> 8661.439
do really shitty jobs just to try to

8659.52 --> 8664.84
appease their parents parents when their

8661.439 --> 8666.439
parents are like you're an idiot like

8664.84 --> 8669.68
you have a shitty job you don't it

8666.439 --> 8672.359
doesn't pay much like you're weak you're

8669.68 --> 8674.279
wasting your life they're probably

8672.359 --> 8678.880000000001
getting told that by their own parents

8674.279 --> 8682.560000000001
and so they see me a free

8678.88 --> 8685.56
person I am truly free in that

8682.56 --> 8687.68
sense doing things that is good at

8685.56 --> 8690.56
getting energy out of it being happy

8687.68 --> 8693.76
with it being happy with little with

8690.56 --> 8696.16
having little I'm happy with the things

8693.76 --> 8699.279
that I have and I could have less and

8696.16 --> 8701.119999999999
I'd still be happy with it and they just

8699.279 --> 8704.6
can't handle it they can't handle that

8701.12 --> 8708.640000000001
they can't do that that they remain a

8704.6 --> 8711.12
slave to the expectations of their own

8708.64 --> 8713.479
siblings and the peer pressure and the

8711.12 --> 8716.560000000001
embarrassment that they suffer

8713.479 --> 8720.679999999998
under and so they try to project all of

8716.56 --> 8726.119999999999
that onto me and I can see it now now

8720.68 --> 8726.12
more and more I can see that it is a

8726.68 --> 8732.24
projection and I can even start to

8729.04 --> 8734.640000000001
address it when they do it it's like I

8732.24 --> 8738.279
know you're projecting right

8734.64 --> 8740.599999999999
now I know your life really sucks and

8738.279 --> 8744.399000000001
you can't stand that this guy over here

8740.6 --> 8746.640000000001
is just happy the way that he's arranged

8744.399 --> 8749.72
his life me

8746.64 --> 8752.599999999999
Arwin even though I don't have all that

8749.72 --> 8752.599999999999
income even

8753.479 --> 8758.119999999999
though yeah I do have clothes with holes

8756.64 --> 8760.68
in him

8758.12 --> 8764.84
and sometimes have money

8760.68 --> 8767.52
issues like I am way more happy to them

8764.84 --> 8769.479
and they can see it they can see it and

8767.52 --> 8772.68
they can feel it and they can't stand it

8769.479 --> 8775.438999999998
they think it's unfair that they have to

8772.68 --> 8776.399
suffer in their shitty life because of

8775.439 --> 8780.04
their

8776.399 --> 8782.24
weaknesses and that I don't suffer in my

8780.04 --> 8782.240000000002
life

8782.52 --> 8787.08
even though I live through conditions

8784.439 --> 8791.0
that they tremble about that they

8787.08 --> 8793.319
consider shitty and they try to project

8791.0 --> 8796.279
that pain that they have about these

8793.319 --> 8800.08
types of conditions onto me even though

8796.279 --> 8803.84
I am not hurting under these

8800.08 --> 8808.24
conditions in fact the more time passes

8803.84 --> 8810.84
the more I feel thoroughly deeply that I

8808.24 --> 8813.72
made the right choices in life even

8810.84 --> 8816.84
though I can't really logically justify

8813.72 --> 8820.199999999999
it too much societally I can't

8816.84 --> 8822.439
communicate like yeah I'm super happy

8820.2 --> 8825.76
with like How I Live Now and this and

8822.439 --> 8829.479000000001
that because it's like a weird story but

8825.76 --> 8831.880000000001
I feel it though I feel I did make the

8829.479 --> 8834.679999999998
right choices and these trolls they

8831.88 --> 8834.679999999998
can't handle

8836.12 --> 8840.960000000001
it they were peer pressured they live in

8839.92 --> 8843.279
hell

8840.96 --> 8845.8
they don't know how to get out and

8843.279 --> 8849.04
seeing somebody that didn't get peer

8845.8 --> 8850.96
pressured into that hell it hurts them

8849.04 --> 8856.84
and so they want to project that pain

8850.96 --> 8858.438999999998
onto me guess what it's not working

8856.84 --> 8862.319
anymore

8858.439 --> 8866.359
huh keep trying though maybe if you just

8862.319 --> 8869.359
do it some more yeah maybe it will start

8866.359 --> 8871.04
to hurt a good old Arwin yeah maybe keep

8869.359 --> 8874.359
trying

8871.04 --> 8877.92
no no it doesn't work and the more time

8874.359 --> 8880.52
passes the less it works until the point

8877.92 --> 8883.8
where I will eventually like

8880.52 --> 8885.319000000001
full-heartedly laugh over witnessing you

8883.8 --> 8888.679999999998
doing that

8885.319 --> 8892.519999999999
thing yeah I will laugh over it

8888.68 --> 8897.12
genuinely because it is really funny the

8892.52 --> 8897.12
more I realize what's really going on

8899.12 --> 8902.12
there

8905.08 --> 8910.96
yeah all these people they all tried to

8908.08 --> 8914.92
climb they tried to climb that mountain

8910.96 --> 8917.119999999999
and now they're all standing on a Ledge

8914.92 --> 8920.08
very tight they can barely hold on and

8917.12 --> 8923.0
they're like look at that Arwin down

8920.08 --> 8927.84
there on the ground just able to walk

8923.0 --> 8930.319
around look at them oh I'm higher than

8927.84 --> 8931.92
him even though they're terrified and

8930.319 --> 8934.24
they could like literally fall off and

8931.92 --> 8937.6
break their necks guaranteed at any

8934.24 --> 8939.64
second but they're laughing at me for

8937.6 --> 8941.16
just having solid footing on the ground

8939.64 --> 8945.439
and just being able to like oh look at

8941.16 --> 8948.08
this grass here oh oh look a little bit

8945.439 --> 8950.2
of water in a river I'm so happy here

8948.08 --> 8951.039999999999
like why the hell would I want to climb

8950.2 --> 8953.560000000001
that

8951.04 --> 8955.479000000001
mountain why are these people [ __ ]

8953.56 --> 8957.56
enough to try to climb that mountain and

8955.479 --> 8960.438999999998
literally risk breaking their neck and

8957.56 --> 8964.039999999999
for what because they were told that

8960.439 --> 8965.2
they're supposed to do that how pathetic

8964.04 --> 8969.080000000002
are

8965.2 --> 8973.16
they I'm on the ground I'm enjoying

8969.08 --> 8976.68
myself I feel closer to the original

8973.16 --> 8979.439
design and purpose of of living human

8976.68 --> 8982.12
beings

8979.439 --> 8985.24
simple a simple

8982.12 --> 8989.160000000002
life with a lot of

8985.24 --> 8991.359
freedom careful not to lose the freedom

8989.16 --> 8993.56
and I'm happy and I'm not going to climb

8991.359 --> 8995.76
that stupid mountain and risk breaking

8993.56 --> 8995.76
my

8998.439 --> 9003.68
neck

9001.399 --> 9006.479
yeah crabs in a bucket yeah that's

9003.68 --> 9006.479000000001
another way to say

9018.96 --> 9023.759999999998
it

9021.84 --> 9026.479
oh debatable D thank you for sharing

9023.76 --> 9030.800000000001
that very

9026.479 --> 9030.8
intimate thing about your life

9030.88 --> 9036.399
Moxy but yeah that is a challenge and I

9034.479 --> 9038.64
think that over time you will realize

9036.399 --> 9039.88
that your dad's basically projecting

9038.64 --> 9042.519999999999
onto

9039.88 --> 9046.599999999999
you and the more you can be honest about

9042.52 --> 9048.92
it the more you will know that it's your

9046.6 --> 9051.439
dad's problem and not

9048.92 --> 9053.960000000001
yours

9051.439 --> 9056.24
that you should be thankful for the

9053.96 --> 9061.08
opportunity to be able to reflect upon

9056.24 --> 9065.319
such thing and learn from it why so that

9061.08 --> 9068.2
you don't end up the same as your dad

9065.319 --> 9069.278999999999
projecting your own shortcomings onto

9068.2 --> 9072.319000000001
another

9069.279 --> 9074.52
forever and that way you can break the

9072.319 --> 9076.92
family curse which is what that sort of

9074.52 --> 9079.439
thing typically is becomes a family

9076.92 --> 9081.64
curse you can't deal with it well then

9079.439 --> 9084.64
it's going to be be your kid's problem

9081.64 --> 9086.599999999999
can they deal with it if not well then

9084.64 --> 9089.039999999999
it's going to be their kid's problem and

9086.6 --> 9092.76
and so on until one of them finally

9089.04 --> 9092.76
figures it out and breaks the

9093.6 --> 9098.6
cycle that's right you think you need

9096.84 --> 9101.880000000001
well everybody needs to cut the curse

9098.6 --> 9104.12
but can you in order to do that you need

9101.88 --> 9107.479
to realize what it is

9104.12 --> 9110.6
first you need to realize that these

9107.479 --> 9114.399
things are projection and that you can't

9110.6 --> 9116.279
like just give a blame to them either

9114.399 --> 9120.08
like they do that for a

9116.279 --> 9122.479000000001
reason you just need to detach yourself

9120.08 --> 9125.479
from that reason and see the problem for

9122.479 --> 9128.72
what it is instead of taking the problem

9125.479 --> 9131.358999999999
and making it your own that's the start

9128.72 --> 9134.519999999999
and you already saying it like that in

9131.359 --> 9136.6
my chat is a good sign it's a good sign

9134.52 --> 9140.960000000001
that means

9136.6 --> 9143.56
that let's just say There's Hope for you

9140.96 --> 9143.56
it's a good

9144.64 --> 9151.199999999999
sign Ah that's great to hear a man go

9148.64 --> 9156.16
it's always great when your dad is proud

9151.2 --> 9156.16
of you not everybody's so lucky

9159.0 --> 9163.68
though you're can identified you're

9161.24 --> 9166.68
still scared you can't stop it violent

9163.68 --> 9169.880000000001
something well

9166.68 --> 9171.16
hey identification realization is the

9169.88 --> 9173.96
first

9171.16 --> 9176.68
step and even if you can't break it then

9173.96 --> 9179.278999999999
maybe you can pass on that

9176.68 --> 9184.04
realization right and then maybe your

9179.279 --> 9187.52
kids can eventually figure it out you

9184.04 --> 9187.52
just have to pass on the

9189.64 --> 9198.76
progress and who knows maybe maybe you

9193.16 --> 9202.359
will be able to to fix it within your

9198.76 --> 9206.16
life don't just give up hope don't don't

9202.359 --> 9210.6
downplay yourself becoming aware of how

9206.16 --> 9213.0
those things work is a very very big

9210.6 --> 9215.68
step you got to realize that there's

9213.0 --> 9217.92
like countless of generations within a

9215.68 --> 9221.64
family that just never got it even if

9217.92 --> 9226.279
they were told it and that you already

9221.64 --> 9226.278999999999
realizing it is a very critical

9228.72 --> 9231.72
step

9237.8 --> 9241.399
well if you see that you're getting

9239.359 --> 9243.24
violent and angry then just realize

9241.399 --> 9244.76
where that comes

9243.24 --> 9247.8
from

9244.76 --> 9251.64
right why are you getting like

9247.8 --> 9254.88
that and then try to separate it don't

9251.64 --> 9257.56
act it out but retract and like where

9254.88 --> 9261.72
did that come from identify the source

9257.56 --> 9261.72
identify the cause

9262.399 --> 9268.24
right but at least you're already there

9265.399 --> 9271.599999999999
where that you would give recognition to

9268.24 --> 9274.399
that that it is an aberant behavior that

9271.6 --> 9277.0
you identified in your parents you don't

9274.399 --> 9279.278999999999
know if it's going to come forth in you

9277.0 --> 9281.6
you being able to identify it to that

9279.279 --> 9284.52
level already without it having come

9281.6 --> 9287.68
forth is usually an indicator that it

9284.52 --> 9287.68
won't come

9288.16 --> 9296.24
forth so

9290.76 --> 9299.56
trust in God trust in the truth trust in

9296.24 --> 9302.119999999999
knowing these things and knowing things

9299.56 --> 9302.119999999999
changes

9302.56 --> 9308.24
it of course it's still a strain but

9305.359 --> 9312.68
knowing in is the critical

9308.24 --> 9314.6
step just don't give up don't overburden

9312.68 --> 9317.52
yourself you don't always have to think

9314.6 --> 9320.479000000001
about these things all the

9317.52 --> 9322.6
time just trust

9320.479 --> 9325.199999999999
trust the logical

9322.6 --> 9330.800000000001
progression of insight and

9325.2 --> 9333.6
knowledge trust it knowing does change

9330.8 --> 9336.479
things knowing gives you an opportunity

9333.6 --> 9341.24
to make different choices that will help

9336.479 --> 9341.24
you grow out of the family curse it

9348.64 --> 9355.399
will

9351.439 --> 9358.76
huh your dad is very wise a man go

9355.399 --> 9358.76
with that's

9371.479 --> 9374.479
great

9378.56 --> 9381.56
right

9389.52 --> 9395.279
going for over two and a half

9392.68 --> 9398.439
hours and yeah we're moving out of the

9395.279 --> 9398.439
main subjects

9399.16 --> 9404.0
course yeah you're

9401.08 --> 9407.88
welcome

9404.0 --> 9410.24
just just take it serious like you have

9407.88 --> 9412.72
to fix yourself and

9410.24 --> 9416.319
knowing is half the battle I mean yeah I

9412.72 --> 9419.0
know it's a GI Joe silly saying but

9416.319 --> 9421.92
it's there's a lot more wisdom there

9419.0 --> 9421.92
than most people

9423.2 --> 9427.6
realize it's just kind of silly to bring

9425.479 --> 9429.599999999999
it out in the context of G Joe which is

9427.6 --> 9432.279
like one of the dumbest freaking cartoon

9429.6 --> 9432.279
series ever

9433.279 --> 9441.52
made it's like this Jesus wisdom that's

9437.439 --> 9441.52
in like the dumbest cartoon ever

9441.92 --> 9444.6
weird like

9449.439 --> 9455.16
that yeah and besides like toughness the

9452.6 --> 9458.880000000001
toughness of the

9455.16 --> 9461.72
process it's the toughness is just the

9458.88 --> 9465.479
friction that's what makes it tough and

9461.72 --> 9468.88
friction is what

9465.479 --> 9470.16
basically smoothens out the rough edges

9468.88 --> 9472.16
on a rock

9470.16 --> 9476.279
yeah that's the toughness the toughness

9472.16 --> 9478.24
is the friction of the rough Rock but

9476.279 --> 9480.92
eventually the friction becomes less and

9478.24 --> 9483.039999999999
then it all becomes very smooth and

9480.92 --> 9484.92
natural and you get a very steady

9483.04 --> 9486.640000000001
pattern out of it and then you know how

9484.92 --> 9489.439
it goes and there is no more friction

9486.64 --> 9492.039999999999
and it's not tough

9489.439 --> 9495.24
anymore yeah it

9492.04 --> 9498.439
becomes skillful and

9495.24 --> 9503.399
smooth think of it like

9498.439 --> 9506.84
that if it's tough It's friction

9503.399 --> 9511.0
friction is just the rough cut being

9506.84 --> 9513.279
smoothened down and eventually you will

9511.0 --> 9515.84
realize how it's getting smooth and down

9513.279 --> 9520.560000000001
it you will see the consistent pattern

9515.84 --> 9520.56
and it will not be so tough on

9528.439 --> 9531.439
you

9541.56 --> 9545.56
oh oh wow man

9547.04 --> 9552.439
go that's F that that is like almost

9550.52 --> 9556.76
literally what I was just saying in

9552.439 --> 9561.359
another way your dad is a very wise

9556.76 --> 9561.359
person very lucky like that

9577.24 --> 9581.96
and he was lucky to have a son that

9578.84 --> 9584.72
would actually assimilate that wisdom as

9581.96 --> 9586.839999999998
well because can be a wise dad say all

9584.72 --> 9588.72
these things and yet if your kids just

9586.84 --> 9592.24
too distracted they're not even going to

9588.72 --> 9592.24
understand the wisdom of it or not

9603.359 --> 9609.68
care make the rock smooth over long

9606.04 --> 9609.68
periods of time yeah

9614.72 --> 9618.319
definitely especially interesting with

9616.84 --> 9620.0
like pieces of

9618.319 --> 9623.199999999999
glass

9620.0 --> 9625.2
right starts out as just a a a dangerous

9623.2 --> 9627.560000000001
Shard of glass you could step in it and

9625.2 --> 9630.399000000001
wound yourself but leave it on the beach

9627.56 --> 9632.64
long enough and eventually it will be

9630.399 --> 9635.76
just this

9632.64 --> 9637.68
smoothie smooth out glass that's never

9635.76 --> 9639.960000000001
going to cut anybody but it it will look

9637.68 --> 9639.960000000001
very

9648.24 --> 9651.24
nice

9658.359 --> 9664.399000000001
wish your dad lives far away from

9660.479 --> 9664.399
you give him a call

9665.08 --> 9669.24
sometimes

9666.64 --> 9670.06
right we could do that right just give

9669.24 --> 9673.27
him a

9670.06 --> 9673.269999999999
[Music]

9678.24 --> 9681.24
call

9683.56 --> 9687.88
all right anyway I think I'm going to

9685.08 --> 9691.68
round out the show it's been

9687.88 --> 9695.278999999999
great very intense very subject

9691.68 --> 9698.92
oriented with a lot of

9695.279 --> 9701.52
ruckus but I've been able to put down

9698.92 --> 9703.8
the subject and the the rough lines and

9701.52 --> 9705.6
the context quite well I think and

9703.8 --> 9708.399
connected up with Aller subjects that

9705.6 --> 9712.880000000001
I've mentioned from the rewriting of

9708.399 --> 9717.199999999999
History and how and why up to the

9712.88 --> 9720.8
rewriting of Christianity

9717.2 --> 9723.92
itself so it's been pretty good like

9720.8 --> 9726.92
being able to put all of it in a much

9723.92 --> 9731.04
grander context that's more cohesive and

9726.92 --> 9731.04
more easy to stick a

9738.16 --> 9741.16
mind

9752.399 --> 9760.199999999999
okay I don't know why the hell You' been

9755.2 --> 9763.2
Kevin Spacey up debatable de is highly

9760.2 --> 9763.2
dubious

9768.12 --> 9776.560000000001
whatever about Babylon

9772.399 --> 9776.56
where visiting History

9777.0 --> 9781.0
Day yeah I guess so I guess it is kind

9779.76 --> 9783.800000000001
of the

9781.0 --> 9786.52
subject but I mean it's been on my mind
