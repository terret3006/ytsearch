97.619 --> 101.6
it's a big super clouds

102.78 --> 107.34
I don't think there's going to be any

104.1 --> 109.91999999999999
blue sky visible anytime soon

107.34 --> 111.06
it's just this uniform gray so it's all

109.92 --> 113.34
clouded

111.06 --> 115.02
it has been pretty much continually

113.34 --> 118.86
raining

115.02 --> 122.24
not raining very hard but still

118.86 --> 125.34
so it's yeah this is a dreary Sunday

122.24 --> 128.0
thus far

125.34 --> 128.0
so

133.099 --> 138.72
it feels a bit like Early Autumn

136.8 --> 143.64000000000001
but

138.72 --> 145.85999999999999
it's still decently warm I mean yeah

143.64 --> 148.27999999999997
it's probably like yesterday 18 degrees

145.86 --> 148.28
again

151.379 --> 155.51999999999998
oh 17.

153.78 --> 159.86
right

155.52 --> 159.86
well yeah it could be a lot worse

160.8 --> 167.72
hmm all right the forecast for a hot

164.22 --> 167.72
Friday is still standing

168.3 --> 172.62
so yeah the weather should be clearing

170.459 --> 176.28
up according to this tomorrow starting

172.62 --> 178.56
tomorrow a bit and then by Wednesday

176.28 --> 181.459
start to get warmer

178.56 --> 181.459
but till Friday

183.18 --> 185.59900000000002
right

187.739 --> 193.019
a little flatter Sage first in chat good

190.14 --> 195.61999999999998
to see you Supreme knowing Richard G how

193.019 --> 195.62
are you all doing

197.159 --> 199.159
um

199.319 --> 204.23899999999998
a supreme knowing right away

202.019 --> 206.34
is it you that's continually getting

204.239 --> 209.28
into his fat with

206.34 --> 211.92000000000002
with Bible you Paula like I continually

209.28 --> 216.12
see her timing you out

211.92 --> 218.33999999999997
like what the hell's going on I mean

216.12 --> 219.59900000000002
I I recommend you kind of try to leave

218.34 --> 222.44
her alone

219.599 --> 222.44
if you can

225.239 --> 230.48000000000002
hello free Minds freed mind

231.239 --> 233.9
foreign

235.379 --> 242.04
so it is Sunday the 6th of August 2023

254.7 --> 259.44
right

256.979 --> 261.44
yeah I feel great by the way

259.44 --> 261.44
I

263.94 --> 268.86
didn't even have super elaborate dinner

266.1 --> 270.54
or anything but I'm just the sleep was

268.86 --> 273.36
really well this night

270.54 --> 275.72
also had a shower in this one my hair is

273.36 --> 275.72
loose

277.5 --> 284.72
but I feel great

280.02 --> 284.71999999999997
had a very big dream again

285.06 --> 290.4
but it was dream and now I also I I'm

288.72 --> 293.72
starting to figure out like why I can't

290.4 --> 293.71999999999997
remember those dreams

293.88 --> 298.86
it's because it's literally gibberish

296.82 --> 300.78
what's happening

298.86 --> 305.16
it's fascinating though because it's

300.78 --> 307.67999999999995
it's a pure feeling based actions and

305.16 --> 311.699
consideration and

307.68 --> 312.90000000000003
and then branching off to another thing

311.699 --> 315.3
like

312.9 --> 319.46
what I do in most of these dreams is

315.3 --> 319.46000000000004
basically like try to recycle

320.04 --> 327.18
or re-simulate the energy

323.639 --> 330.12
it's all about like trying to

327.18 --> 332.6
figure out energy of things

330.12 --> 332.6
because

333.0 --> 336.06
like there's no big story that's playing

335.039 --> 338.52
out

336.06 --> 340.38
or anything it's just doing things it's

338.52 --> 342.71999999999997
like I'm in a warehouse and the

340.38 --> 345.18
warehouse is completely loaded with

342.72 --> 346.88000000000005
stuff

345.18 --> 349.5
and I mean like

346.88 --> 352.199
incredible different amounts of stuff

349.5 --> 354.12
like things and I just like move from

352.199 --> 356.46000000000004
one thing to another and let's try to

354.12 --> 359.0
figure it out and then it reminds me of

356.46 --> 359.0
things and

363.24 --> 368.94
and there's like other people that I'm

365.4 --> 371.039
discussing it's like there's it's almost

368.94 --> 372.71999999999997
like a big Echo chamber effect a lot of

371.039 --> 375.479
time because there are other people in

372.72 --> 377.52000000000004
there but like in the dream I literally

375.479 --> 379.86
don't care about them at all

377.52 --> 382.34
they're just like puppets to me but they

379.86 --> 384.84000000000003
have a full

382.34 --> 387.419
seeming conscious like they seem to be

384.84 --> 391.4
doing the same thing as I am in the

387.419 --> 393.0
processing and I can have like conscious

391.4 --> 394.979
interactions

393.0 --> 399.62
but it doesn't really matter because I'm

394.979 --> 399.62
just so focused on doing that thing

400.259 --> 406.699
which is like a non-cognitive process

403.139 --> 410.419
it's purely like just comparing

406.699 --> 410.41900000000004
frequencies of things

410.52 --> 415.139
and like trying to because it's like I'm

412.86 --> 417.0
puzzling something out but the puzzle

415.139 --> 420.24
that I'm effectively doing is like

417.0 --> 422.819
creating the pattern like rebuilding

420.24 --> 424.62
refining the pattern and I mean the

422.819 --> 427.139
pattern of all things

424.62 --> 429.12
that's cut I think that might be part of

427.139 --> 432.139
the thing that I'm doing

429.12 --> 432.139
in those dreams

432.539 --> 437.09999999999997
maybe this is like a very long-term

434.88 --> 438.71999999999997
project that I started in my teens when

437.1 --> 444.319
I discovered

438.72 --> 444.319
the pattern like that that is a thing

445.139 --> 453.02
or at least conceptually but like

448.52 --> 453.02
existentially it would have to be real

456.18 --> 459.319
because there's order

460.139 --> 467.539
there wouldn't be order without it like

462.9 --> 467.539
any on any level right anyway

469.199 --> 471.91900000000004
low tank

480.3 --> 485.96000000000004
Nathan Nathan Badger what do you mean

482.58 --> 485.96
Nathan banjo but

486.96 --> 490.75899999999996
I think she knows everything

489.139 --> 493.56
yeah

490.759 --> 496.34000000000003
yes Supreme knowing

493.56 --> 496.34
I know

496.639 --> 500.96000000000004
that's why I like

503.039 --> 508.02
I'm basically saying don't follower

506.46 --> 510.0
like

508.02 --> 511.08
sure she'll have some interesting

510.0 --> 512.64
stories

511.08 --> 515.64
but

512.64 --> 517.26
like she yeah I don't want to get into

515.64 --> 518.779
criticizing her I'll just start

517.26 --> 522.7189999999999
everybody

518.779 --> 526.02
again so but

522.719 --> 529.1600000000001
you know follower good

526.02 --> 529.16
but you're right

530.88 --> 539.399
she gets things wrong and she has like

534.6 --> 543.0
like improper micro obsessions

539.399 --> 544.86
I mean she is literally a feminist I

543.0 --> 548.959
don't know if anybody's noticed that but

544.86 --> 548.9590000000001
it's like pretty damn overt

549.36 --> 554.0600000000001
so it's like set in within her

558.12 --> 565.339
lots of hate yeah resentment towards the

561.24 --> 565.339
world and the natural Order of Things

566.459 --> 570.3
it really feels like she's kind of like

569.459 --> 573.8389999999999
a

570.3 --> 577.26
an old feminist that turned

573.839 --> 580.019
flat earther and biblical

577.26 --> 581.7
which is by the way pretty cool I mean

580.019 --> 583.98
it's

581.7 --> 586.82
better than without it but

583.98 --> 586.82
she's just

589.8 --> 595.92
she's so sad so formed like I don't

594.12 --> 598.08
think I don't think anything could

595.92 --> 599.9399999999999
really change her

598.08 --> 604.519
like she's not gonna change anything

599.94 --> 604.519
about her ways like really not

605.04 --> 611.3389999999999
because she's already like created this

608.7 --> 615.0600000000001
micro ideology for herself with those

611.339 --> 617.8800000000001
things like it's very obvious

615.06 --> 620.64
and she does unfortunately have some

617.88 --> 623.58
wisdom

620.64 --> 626.9399999999999
she's not complete like she's not like a

623.58 --> 629.88
nut case or anything like that but some

626.94 --> 632.7
feminists can't be

629.88 --> 637.1
but still like it it is

632.7 --> 637.1
a political struggle it seems and

638.16 --> 643.5
she is basically like

641.04 --> 648.3199999999999
trying to justify it and that's a bad

643.5 --> 648.32
position to take in my humble opinion

648.839 --> 652.519
she is delusional yeah

654.899 --> 662.339
well to me it's very familiar because

658.8 --> 665.4799999999999
I used to do something like that too

662.339 --> 665.48
a long time ago

665.88 --> 673.2
like I would like try to carry my

669.42 --> 676.26
liberal like it's equal it's oh equal

673.2 --> 680.24
I would try to carry that through but it

676.26 --> 680.24
would result in the illusion

681.48 --> 687.98
because it's just not true not equal

684.48 --> 687.98
things are not equal

697.019 --> 703.68
radical Christians yeah

699.66 --> 703.68
yeah a radical hermeneuticist

704.279 --> 711.62
that that's rather what I'd call it she

706.62 --> 711.62
is a radical hermene hermano wet assist

735.24 --> 739.44
I don't even want to call that Christian

737.1 --> 741.24
because I think it is like diametrically

739.44 --> 742.6800000000001
in opposition to everything Christ

741.24 --> 745.32
taught

742.68 --> 749.5999999999999
so I'm just I'm gonna just call it a

745.32 --> 749.6
hermano etisist how about that

749.76 --> 752.0
foreign

754.62 --> 761.22
those who follow the teachings of man

758.459 --> 764.04
not the one they claim

761.22 --> 768.0790000000001
to be God

764.04 --> 768.079
it's really ironic by the way

769.32 --> 774.3000000000001
may I share a channel you fun

771.959 --> 777.3
help a lot of people well that doesn't

774.3 --> 780.9799999999999
sound good at all but you can tell me

777.3 --> 780.9799999999999
about it for starters

787.86 --> 792.2
what's it called what does it talk about

792.839 --> 796.1
let's start with that

799.32 --> 804.6
oh yeah hello turret

801.6 --> 808.5600000000001
306.

804.6 --> 810.4200000000001
we're talking about Bible us she's

808.56 --> 813.92
called herself

810.42 --> 813.92
in YouTube right now

815.04 --> 818.9399999999999
because I took notice that this

817.86 --> 821.7
like

818.94 --> 823.32
she's always timing out Supreme knowing

821.7 --> 825.5400000000001
and stuff

823.32 --> 829.1600000000001
I just been noticing that a lot I

825.54 --> 829.16
haven't really said anything about it

830.16 --> 834.06
I mean

831.48 --> 838.019
to be fair Supreme no I mean it does

834.06 --> 840.2399999999999
very much seem like you're not trying to

838.019 --> 842.399
be careful though

840.24 --> 847.76
okay

842.399 --> 847.76
so yes level up as she used to be called

852.779 --> 858.26
you keep quiet that's right you better

855.06 --> 858.26
keep quiet yeah

865.62 --> 869.579
like I gave quite you better keep quiet

868.019 --> 872.82
I mean

869.579 --> 874.92
if you you'll find out very quickly what

872.82 --> 877.139
happens when you don't do that yeah

874.92 --> 880.38
you'll immediately be targeted as a

877.139 --> 883.98
troll and then on top of that if you're

880.38 --> 886.56
obviously like a follower of my channel

883.98 --> 888.0600000000001
because they know they keep track of

886.56 --> 888.959
that stuff

888.06 --> 891.2399999999999
okay

888.959 --> 894.54
then they'll pile on

891.24 --> 896.94
all the karmic judgments and all that

894.54 --> 899.88
that they have about me and they pilot

896.94 --> 903.12
right on top of you too so you get that

899.88 --> 905.82
on top you gotta realize that

903.12 --> 908.22
like we are like being treated like we

905.82 --> 910.98
are a micro cult

908.22 --> 913.9200000000001
by some of these people

910.98 --> 915.9590000000001
out there in the Flat Earth

913.92 --> 917.519
they're treating us like we're a micro

915.959 --> 920.3389999999999
cup

917.519 --> 924.32
just because you are here in my chat

920.339 --> 924.32
following my show and talking

926.82 --> 932.839
and got a wrench

929.639 --> 932.839
that's pretty much it

933.899 --> 938.48
and yeah that's not really Gonna Change

938.94 --> 944.1600000000001
and the only way we can really change

941.04 --> 946.56
anything about it like as a group you

944.16 --> 950.639
could say is

946.56 --> 952.9799999999999
if more of you guys basically show up

950.639 --> 954.72
get into it

952.98 --> 957.1800000000001
feel at home

954.72 --> 959.6990000000001
if there's more of us

957.18 --> 962.3389999999999
that are like like you guys

959.699 --> 965.399
and we all just lend each other

962.339 --> 967.5790000000001
strengths because that's what we do

965.399 --> 967.579
foreign

969.48 --> 972.1800000000001
right

970.74 --> 973.8
then

972.18 --> 976.8599999999999
there's yeah

973.8 --> 979.079
like I haven't really gotten into a spat

976.86 --> 981.3000000000001
with Paula because I'm just very careful

979.079 --> 985.199
you can do that too

981.3 --> 987.18
and then just let her do her thing and

985.199 --> 989.279
when she shows up she has to do a thing

987.18 --> 991.56
and then just prove how she's like oh

989.279 --> 994.8
I'm a

991.56 --> 997.3199999999999
I'm OG f e d

994.8 --> 999.06
Ivan Authority here I can time you out

997.32 --> 1002.36
even though

999.06 --> 1004.8389999999999
you're like loyal followers

1002.36 --> 1004.839
right

1006.139 --> 1012.22
just

1007.759 --> 1012.22
if she shows up in the chat just like

1013.88 --> 1019.699
I don't know maybe block her

1016.82 --> 1022.639
that worked for me very well

1019.699 --> 1025.6399999999999
I don't have her block right now

1022.639 --> 1027.439
but I did like when I got when she got

1025.64 --> 1029.72
really angry because I criticized her

1027.439 --> 1033.52
about something again I mean that woman

1029.72 --> 1033.52
holds a grudge for months

1033.559 --> 1039.26
and then I just didn't even want to see

1035.72 --> 1042.199
it anymore so I just blocked like okay

1039.26 --> 1045.02
now I'm not seeing anything of you and

1042.199 --> 1046.64
the only way I know that you're there of

1045.02 --> 1048.98
course is because you're gonna notify

1046.64 --> 1050.74
everybody and then somebody like Neil is

1048.98 --> 1054.44
gonna say like

1050.74 --> 1057.08
why did you have to do this or when

1054.44 --> 1060.26
he's always [ __ ] doing that why how

1057.08 --> 1063.22
do you have to do this to us or win like

1060.26 --> 1063.22
what the [ __ ] man

1064.82 --> 1069.4399999999998
I'm not gonna give you some kind of

1067.039 --> 1072.559
special boy treatment

1069.44 --> 1075.22
I treat everybody

1072.559 --> 1075.22
equally

1075.26 --> 1078.62
and if you're out of line you're out of

1077.12 --> 1081.26
line I'm gonna say it

1078.62 --> 1084.1399999999999
I'm gonna say it by my own judgment and

1081.26 --> 1086.66
not by your freaking standards of how

1084.14 --> 1089.0800000000002
you judge yourself that's not how that

1086.66 --> 1089.0800000000002
works

1091.22 --> 1094.82
ah

1092.9 --> 1096.38
but yeah I don't want to get into a

1094.82 --> 1099.2
hassle again I bet dude they're gonna

1096.38 --> 1101.72
hear of this tomorrow why did you have

1099.2 --> 1104.66
to start talking about that again Erwin

1101.72 --> 1107.8600000000001
yeah because

1104.66 --> 1107.8600000000001
sometimes you do

1109.12 --> 1113.5
and grudges are not very Christian

1114.62 --> 1120.32
I think they do realize that

1116.84 --> 1121.8799999999999
but they're not really helping each

1120.32 --> 1124.34
other out

1121.88 --> 1128.0800000000002
with it though because they do actually

1124.34 --> 1128.08
like enable that continually

1131.539 --> 1137.539
I mean just one time I have to get like

1134.78 --> 1140.36
into a public disagreement where I get

1137.539 --> 1143.179
pissed off or I start yelling like can

1140.36 --> 1146.0
you stop [ __ ] rumpusing me I want to

1143.179 --> 1148.1200000000001
complete my sentence here I have a

1146.0 --> 1151.1
message I want to complete it stop

1148.12 --> 1152.78
rumpusing me stop continuing talking

1151.1 --> 1156.1999999999998
over me

1152.78 --> 1157.94
right that [ __ ] every time that [ __ ]

1156.2 --> 1160.88
happens

1157.94 --> 1163.76
they all start like giving me the evil

1160.88 --> 1167.5390000000002
eye all of a sudden and like oh they

1163.76 --> 1170.72
love to roll out the list of every damn

1167.539 --> 1175.1
thing I did bad again seriously that's

1170.72 --> 1179.48
not even a joke it's deranged it's sick

1175.1 --> 1181.6999999999998
you [ __ ] keep a list a record of

1179.48 --> 1183.5
every time I got angry to somebody

1181.7 --> 1186.44
publicly

1183.5 --> 1189.32
that's [ __ ] sick dude who the [ __ ]

1186.44 --> 1191.48
you think you are the police

1189.32 --> 1192.9189999999999
you think you're the freaking police

1191.48 --> 1195.14
Bureau

1192.919 --> 1199.7800000000002
you should keep a record of my

1195.14 --> 1199.7800000000002
misbehaviors that's the range dude

1201.32 --> 1206.539
foreign

1203.5 --> 1209.12
[ __ ] time I get angry again you pull

1206.539 --> 1211.9
out the list when do you think that's

1209.12 --> 1211.8999999999999
ever gonna happen

1212.84 --> 1217.82
you know if you keep pushing that far

1215.059 --> 1221.299
enough you know what I'll do I'll just

1217.82 --> 1223.039
do something so much worse that

1221.299 --> 1226.8799999999999
literally the list is completely

1223.039 --> 1231.08
insignificant that's what I do

1226.88 --> 1235.419
so that you're rambling whining

1231.08 --> 1238.6399999999999
would then resultively be shorter

1235.419 --> 1242.0
afterward because I sure as hell no I

1238.64 --> 1244.039
can't make you stop doing that yeah but

1242.0 --> 1246.86
I could do something so much [ __ ]

1244.039 --> 1249.98
worse though so much more brutally

1246.86 --> 1253.1599999999999
insulting and direct

1249.98 --> 1256.46
that it could make you stop rambling off

1253.16 --> 1259.28
all the whiny complaints about every

1256.46 --> 1262.52
time I was pissed off and said something

1259.28 --> 1264.62
mean to somebody yeah

1262.52 --> 1267.44
sick

1264.62 --> 1269.0
it's sick that you do that you keep a

1267.44 --> 1270.74
[ __ ] list of this and every time

1269.0 --> 1271.52
something goes wrong you roll out the

1270.74 --> 1273.98
list

1271.52 --> 1276.26
like I'm [ __ ] happy that I'm not

1273.98 --> 1279.58
married to you God

1276.26 --> 1279.58
oh my God

1283.64 --> 1286.64
oh

1287.96 --> 1293.3600000000001
hello soundly banana cam

1291.08 --> 1297.22
see you

1293.36 --> 1297.2199999999998
right so that was that

1297.26 --> 1302.419
by the way nothing happened online you

1300.02 --> 1304.6
recently to provoke this it's just that

1302.419 --> 1304.6000000000001
I

1305.12 --> 1311.4799999999998
I wanted to address that I noticed that

1307.94 --> 1313.1000000000001
you got timed out a lot Supreme knowing

1311.48 --> 1317.44
even though

1313.1 --> 1317.4399999999998
you don't really act like a troll

1320.36 --> 1324.82
right now you need a shower what the

1331.28 --> 1336.74
acting so morally Superior yeah it isn't

1334.28 --> 1339.8799999999999
that's not acting morally Superior it's

1336.74 --> 1344.2
called patronizing

1339.88 --> 1344.2
that's the proper word for it

1345.799 --> 1348.799
foreign

1351.33 --> 1354.5
[Music]

1359.179 --> 1363.4
I was talking to Supreme knowing there

1367.82 --> 1374.12
no you're all good right anyway I got

1371.659 --> 1376.3400000000001
some rookula

1374.12 --> 1378.1999999999998
any Illuminati Castle I'm Really Gonna

1376.34 --> 1379.78
dig into this because I'm freaking

1378.2 --> 1381.74
hungry

1379.78 --> 1384.46
cheers

1381.74 --> 1384.46
oh

1398.27 --> 1401.319
[Music]

1403.94 --> 1407.74
hey LSG good to see you

1417.79 --> 1420.92
[Music]

1423.26 --> 1426.32
all right

1424.52 --> 1430.82
but anyway

1426.32 --> 1434.9189999999999
to run definitely round out the rambling

1430.82 --> 1434.9189999999999
about people that keep lists

1435.5 --> 1441.88
and bring out that entire [ __ ] list

1437.6 --> 1441.8799999999999
anytime something heats up

1441.919 --> 1449.179
it's so goddamn ridiculous like

1445.94 --> 1451.9
you realize that I can keep a list too I

1449.179 --> 1454.22
could do that you know how unbelievably

1451.9 --> 1457.0590000000002
humiliating that would be

1454.22 --> 1457.059
to you

1458.659 --> 1462.3400000000001
because this alleged person that keeps a

1461.299 --> 1466.1589999999999
list

1462.34 --> 1467.8999999999999
certainly goes overboard a lot more than

1466.159 --> 1471.74
I actually do

1467.9 --> 1474.52
and I mean a lot more as in at least

1471.74 --> 1474.52
once a week

1479.62 --> 1485.84
if you have any damn decency if you

1482.78 --> 1488.0
actually listened to Christ

1485.84 --> 1489.6789999999999
you'll realize that you have to let go

1488.0 --> 1491.96
such things because

1489.679 --> 1496.7800000000002
people move on

1491.96 --> 1496.78
yeah I forgive a lot of damn things

1501.26 --> 1507.26
and expect them to behave similarly

1503.6 --> 1509.12
since they are self-professed Christians

1507.26 --> 1511.72
you know self-professed Christians

1509.12 --> 1514.58
shouldn't keep lists of people's

1511.72 --> 1518.74
violations and then whip that list out

1514.58 --> 1518.74
every [ __ ] time they get into a spat

1527.84 --> 1535.1
I'd rather associate

1530.799 --> 1539.6589999999999
that type of reaction Behavior

1535.1 --> 1543.32
with another alleged religious group if

1539.659 --> 1547.0390000000002
you know what I mean yeah

1543.32 --> 1550.7
yeah that's exactly that's what they do

1547.039 --> 1553.22
yeah they keep list they do that but

1550.7 --> 1556.5800000000002
that's what they do yeah

1553.22 --> 1562.419
it's not what Christians do

1556.58 --> 1562.4189999999999
Jesus specifically advises against that

1562.52 --> 1565.179
huh

1565.82 --> 1571.96
don't know all the grudge

1567.98 --> 1571.96
because that what that is

1574.539 --> 1581.62
Jehovah's that's very funny Supreme now

1577.82 --> 1581.62
you know who I was talking about

1585.52 --> 1592.6399999999999
I was talking about

1588.559 --> 1595.22
the religion and the bloodline and the

1592.64 --> 1598.1000000000001
nation whatever it is

1595.22 --> 1602.24
or the rune

1598.1 --> 1606.1
it's also a Germanic rune

1602.24 --> 1610.1
it's all things it's in everything

1606.1 --> 1610.1
it's you

1632.12 --> 1638.7399999999998
yeah that's right Jews actually keep

1634.7 --> 1638.74
graduates a lot of them

1640.7 --> 1645.74
at least some of them that like that

1644.0 --> 1646.88
would be fair fair enough statement

1645.74 --> 1649.159
right

1646.88 --> 1652.159
not all of them

1649.159 --> 1655.779
some people some of them literally have

1652.159 --> 1655.779
better ways to spend their time

1665.0 --> 1673.299
does refusing to go to the gym count as

1668.6 --> 1673.299
resistance training that's very funny

1674.659 --> 1678.46
at least one of them don't

1680.659 --> 1684.279
which one dank

1694.46 --> 1701.559
is that you

1697.22 --> 1701.559
I didn't know I I don't know

1704.0 --> 1708.64
you're gonna have to be more specific

1705.74 --> 1708.64
than that dank

1716.48 --> 1722.419
Dutchman has invented shoes oh God

1720.2 --> 1725.72
sounds like a soundly banana sound

1722.419 --> 1728.26
please banana cam is going off a comedy

1725.72 --> 1728.26
tour

1734.539 --> 1738.26
yeah at least one doesn't I don't know

1736.58 --> 1740.98
which one

1738.26 --> 1740.98
oh okay

1750.5 --> 1752.5
um

1755.659 --> 1760.0
yeah I was just kind of joking about

1760.039 --> 1766.58
it's just that

1762.26 --> 1771.52
I kind of recognize that behavior

1766.58 --> 1771.52
from Jews rather than from Christians

1771.98 --> 1774.52
like

1774.86 --> 1781.84
people that I really thought of as

1777.32 --> 1781.84
Christians because they lived like that

1783.2 --> 1786.88
they would never do that

1791.179 --> 1798.5800000000002
like they would mostly refrain from

1795.14 --> 1798.5800000000002
berating entirely

1801.02 --> 1803.559
thank you

1811.46 --> 1815.419
unlike B rather be straightforward and

1814.46 --> 1819.52
clear

1815.419 --> 1819.5200000000002
and try to find some kind of solution

1826.279 --> 1833.299
right but then again in those times like

1830.299 --> 1836.6589999999999
I never said any of the things that I

1833.299 --> 1841.039
say right now on my show and all that

1836.659 --> 1845.5590000000002
I mean I've been really openly opposing

1841.039 --> 1845.559
key doctrines of Christianity

1847.46 --> 1853.46
so maybe that does like kind of break

1851.059 --> 1856.6399999999999
Christians even the ones that would be

1853.46 --> 1858.799
really well behaved I don't know

1856.64 --> 1861.44
it might

1858.799 --> 1865.779
I certainly didn't intend that to happen

1861.44 --> 1865.779
it's just that I really believe

1867.98 --> 1872.539
it's this big puzzle

1870.14 --> 1874.8200000000002
like Christianity is like we've been

1872.539 --> 1878.24
presented with a puzzle and really get

1874.82 --> 1882.62
good people get into it it does work

1878.24 --> 1886.0
but it also in ways

1882.62 --> 1886.0
keep you locked

1887.059 --> 1891.32
and there's the blatant

1889.34 --> 1893.6589999999999
violations

1891.32 --> 1895.34
that that just take place within the

1893.659 --> 1897.3990000000001
doctrine especially within

1895.34 --> 1900.02
hermaninoetics

1897.399 --> 1904.34
and it's just like

1900.02 --> 1905.6589999999999
as an actual dedicated person to God and

1904.34 --> 1908.6589999999999
and Truth

1905.659 --> 1910.5200000000002
like I must point that out even if that

1908.659 --> 1911.419
literally makes everybody want to kill

1910.52 --> 1916.059
me

1911.419 --> 1916.0590000000002
like I must point it out

1916.7 --> 1919.24
cause

1919.46 --> 1923.8400000000001
it's the devil again

1921.44 --> 1926.419
it's lies

1923.84 --> 1930.3799999999999
being kept in place with

1926.419 --> 1932.659
great feelings again that's the devil it

1930.38 --> 1937.0390000000002
has to be that's literally a mechanism

1932.659 --> 1941.3600000000001
and the mechanism is the devil

1937.039 --> 1942.919
you accept an illusion in favor for good

1941.36 --> 1947.4189999999999
feelings

1942.919 --> 1951.98
or feelings a safety of community

1947.419 --> 1955.88
but you're literally accepting a lie

1951.98 --> 1959.299
a Lie by the very doctrine that you use

1955.88 --> 1962.24
as a foundation for your [ __ ] belief

1959.299 --> 1967.1
and it's inacceptable

1962.24 --> 1969.86
it's it's literally the devil

1967.1 --> 1971.6589999999999
the devil is always very [ __ ]

1969.86 --> 1973.1589999999999
comfortable

1971.659 --> 1977.0800000000002
for you

1973.159 --> 1977.0800000000002
for you and not for others

1978.32 --> 1982.4189999999999
not for those that seek the truth

1984.02 --> 1990.1399999999999
yeah primary objective number one for

1986.96 --> 1992.8400000000001
the devil get in sneak in and then make

1990.14 --> 1994.76
you shut up make you stop climbing make

1992.84 --> 1997.72
you stop being curious make you stop

1994.76 --> 2001.019
seeking higher ways make you stop

1997.72 --> 2001.019
improving things

2002.08 --> 2007.899
make you stop finding a way through

2005.2 --> 2011.74
that's what the devil does and it starts

2007.899 --> 2014.9189999999999
with accepting lies for convenience

2011.74 --> 2017.86
yeah and that's exactly what what a lot

2014.919 --> 2021.94
of Christianity has become

2017.86 --> 2024.1
believe in this riddle and you're saved

2021.94 --> 2025.419
don't believe in this riddle and you go

2024.1 --> 2028.6
to hell

2025.419 --> 2032.44
and everybody will act very angry at you

2028.6 --> 2036.7199999999998
on top of that while you're still alive

2032.44 --> 2036.72
yeah that's [ __ ] up

2041.559 --> 2049.5
it's definitely not

2044.98 --> 2051.22
what Jesus Christ intended his followers

2049.5 --> 2055.859
to do

2051.22 --> 2055.859
I guaran [ __ ] Tian

2072.24 --> 2076.0
and when he says

2074.13 --> 2080.02
[Music]

2076.0 --> 2080.02
I'm roughly paraphrasing

2080.26 --> 2085.78
only

2082.179 --> 2089.379
through me can you get to the father

2085.78 --> 2092.8
right that doesn't mean you must believe

2089.379 --> 2094.5
that I am God or you will go to hell it

2092.8 --> 2098.7400000000002
means

2094.5 --> 2101.98
do what I do

2098.74 --> 2106.72
through me through my methods through my

2101.98 --> 2109.02
wisdom through acting like me do you get

2106.72 --> 2111.22
to the father not

2109.02 --> 2113.7599999999998
idolatizing me

2111.22 --> 2120.2999999999997
into the [ __ ] creator of all things

2113.76 --> 2120.3
that dies for you you sick [ __ ]

2120.7 --> 2123.79
[Music]

2131.26 --> 2135.88
sorry

2132.46 --> 2139.42
going off on the tangent ear or rather

2135.88 --> 2141.4
anger spiral I shouldn't do that

2139.42 --> 2143.92
shouldn't swear when I talk about this

2141.4 --> 2146.339
kind of thing it's inappropriate I

2143.92 --> 2146.339
apologize

2147.099 --> 2152.5
that just pisses me off so bad because I

2149.859 --> 2154.72
see it I just see it stares me in the

2152.5 --> 2159.3
face all the time

2154.72 --> 2159.2999999999997
and it's like nothing I can do about it

2160.18 --> 2164.6189999999997
except

2161.619 --> 2167.32
keep chasing the demon out keep luring

2164.619 --> 2170.32
it out and there it goes again how dare

2167.32 --> 2172.3590000000004
you where keep doing that like keep

2170.32 --> 2174.46
pulling it out keep pulling it out and

2172.359 --> 2176.44
maybe at some point like

2174.46 --> 2178.839
there will be like a conscious

2176.44 --> 2182.46
realization of what the [ __ ] it is that

2178.839 --> 2182.46
is actually happening to these people

2185.38 --> 2190.32
and then maybe they can figure their way

2187.9 --> 2190.32
out again

2197.98 --> 2201.9
what lies to anything in particular

2206.079 --> 2212.76
that

2207.839 --> 2216.66
Jesus is literally God

2212.76 --> 2216.6600000000003
incarnated into a man

2216.7 --> 2223.5989999999997
and that he had to die

2219.46 --> 2226.32
for anything to change it's all freaking

2223.599 --> 2226.32
absurd

2226.42 --> 2233.02
to die for our sin what you mean the sin

2229.9 --> 2235.0
that everybody was basically doomed by

2233.02 --> 2237.16
before that

2235.0 --> 2241.18
eternally

2237.16 --> 2245.6189999999997
who the [ __ ] conjured that [ __ ]

2241.18 --> 2247.72
nobody is born doomed except by

2245.619 --> 2250.7200000000003
the inevitable

2247.72 --> 2253.2599999999998
death of time

2250.72 --> 2253.2599999999998
right

2254.98 --> 2262.26
it's all just Priestly indoctrination

2259.48 --> 2262.26
all of it

2270.52 --> 2275.56
it's in the Bible mate what in the Bible

2274.119 --> 2279.2400000000002
mate

2275.56 --> 2279.24
that he is God no

2281.74 --> 2288.3999999999996
he's with God

2284.68 --> 2292.24
God is with everybody it's all inside of

2288.4 --> 2295.42
you nobody is God God is Not

2292.24 --> 2297.8999999999996
a thing that he created you don't create

2295.42 --> 2297.9
yourself

2301.9 --> 2308.579
God made the world

2304.3 --> 2308.579
the world is the world

2309.7 --> 2316.96
and through US thus

2312.82 --> 2319.54
insight and Consciousness and Brilliant

2316.96 --> 2322.2400000000002
Powers come

2319.54 --> 2324.94
because I believe we are like a fragment

2322.24 --> 2326.56
of God's Consciousness itself that's

2324.94 --> 2328.2400000000002
here to

2326.56 --> 2331.2
basically

2328.24 --> 2331.2
do the test

2331.3 --> 2339.2400000000002
like God is created the realm and is

2335.32 --> 2339.2400000000002
playing it like a video game maybe

2339.52 --> 2342.96
and he's playing us

2343.359 --> 2347.56
and he designed us like in the spirit

2345.64 --> 2350.3799999999997
realm and we were with him and we

2347.56 --> 2352.66
communicate with him and he laid it out

2350.38 --> 2354.579
like this is what what you can do we

2352.66 --> 2357.7
want to do that

2354.579 --> 2363.1800000000003
and then we said yes and so we were born

2357.7 --> 2363.18
and then we went off and and live

2366.04 --> 2371.5
yeah who did Jesus pray to that says

2367.96 --> 2374.94
that's right Jesus is not God no man

2371.5 --> 2374.94
shall be God

2374.98 --> 2380.4
yeah

2376.06 --> 2380.4
no man shall be God

2392.68 --> 2400.5
it's impossible we're all

2396.839 --> 2400.5
fragments of God

2401.02 --> 2405.24
but no one is God

2406.78 --> 2414.82
shall never manifest in full within his

2411.64 --> 2418.359
own creation it's like illogical it's

2414.82 --> 2422.44
illogical from every angle

2418.359 --> 2425.98
like from a creationist

2422.44 --> 2429.099
perspective it's illogical

2425.98 --> 2432.4
now tell tell me which video game you

2429.099 --> 2435.04
literally entered As You Are

2432.4 --> 2438.52
no you don't yeah you create a little

2435.04 --> 2442.42
Avatar like a vessel that is based on

2438.52 --> 2445.9
the mechanics of the thing that you made

2442.42 --> 2448.359
and then you might control that

2445.9 --> 2451.54
and then you might even make one special

2448.359 --> 2456.16
one that's like oh yeah this one stands

2451.54 --> 2459.579
out and use it to basically Break The

2456.16 --> 2461.7999999999997
Meta scale and start telling

2459.579 --> 2463.42
things in the video game through your

2461.8 --> 2466.0600000000004
character that it's actually a video

2463.42 --> 2469.3
game and that somebody designed it and

2466.06 --> 2470.619
that he's using that character to tell

2469.3 --> 2473.8
them that

2470.619 --> 2477.6600000000003
yeah that's as far as it goes

2473.8 --> 2477.6600000000003
that's called channeling God

2485.859 --> 2491.2599999999998
besides

2487.9 --> 2493.1800000000003
has it not been fully worn on multiple

2491.26 --> 2497.38
occasions in the Bible that if you

2493.18 --> 2499.18
actually face God you probably burn up

2497.38 --> 2501.1600000000003
you'll literally start to catch fire

2499.18 --> 2503.0789999999997
because of the sin that is grafted

2501.16 --> 2506.68
within you

2503.079 --> 2510.76
well not a lot of people burn up

2506.68 --> 2513.4199999999996
when they faced Jesus now did they

2510.76 --> 2513.42
yeah

2513.579 --> 2519.96
that's all of it all of it there's no

2517.359 --> 2519.96
consistency

2522.7 --> 2528.3999999999996
it's like this this weird paradoxical

2525.46 --> 2530.079
cycle between the New Testament and the

2528.4 --> 2531.88
Old Testament it's like the New

2530.079 --> 2534.3390000000004
Testament

2531.88 --> 2536.8
has a point because of the Old Testament

2534.339 --> 2539.68
that basically predicts

2536.8 --> 2541.96
Jesus is coming that that is why he is

2539.68 --> 2544.2999999999997
the Messiah he's fulfilling

2541.96 --> 2546.099
that prophecy

2544.3 --> 2549.04
yeah

2546.099 --> 2551.079
but then the freaking people that follow

2549.04 --> 2555.099
him

2551.079 --> 2558.099
basically ignore everything like they

2555.099 --> 2560.26
ignore the Old Testament they ignore the

2558.099 --> 2561.88
lessons and how it works and they

2560.26 --> 2563.26
basically start saying like dude that's

2561.88 --> 2565.9
not our God

2563.26 --> 2570.5400000000004
no Jesus is God

2565.9 --> 2570.54
and like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

2571.599 --> 2576.42
like you

2573.64 --> 2579.7799999999997
you've now basically completely

2576.42 --> 2579.78
disregarded like

2579.94 --> 2585.04
the entire run up

2582.88 --> 2588.099
to Jesus is coming

2585.04 --> 2590.819
and and exchange that for literal

2588.099 --> 2590.819
idolatry

2590.88 --> 2598.839
idolatry compounded with ignorance about

2594.88 --> 2600.76
the very rules that were professed

2598.839 --> 2605.339
were channeled

2600.76 --> 2605.3390000000004
by the priests in the Old Testament like

2605.8 --> 2611.44
it's a system

2608.02 --> 2614.14
there's a pattern to it

2611.44 --> 2615.7000000000003
it doesn't just oh Jesus comes oh now

2614.14 --> 2619.839
it's just oh it doesn't matter anymore

2615.7 --> 2623.339
no no Jesus matters because of that old

2619.839 --> 2623.339
stuff it doesn't go away

2625.72 --> 2630.7599999999998
those patterns are still there

2628.359 --> 2634.0
and so there are either two logical

2630.76 --> 2636.28
conclusions you can add and that is that

2634.0 --> 2639.4
Jesus basically

2636.28 --> 2642.4
found God and figured out that

2639.4 --> 2643.9
what happened before then was basically

2642.4 --> 2647.52
a form of

2643.9 --> 2647.52
we hear demon worship

2649.3 --> 2654.88
which is very ironic

2652.3 --> 2657.76
considering that he would be the Messiah

2654.88 --> 2661.599
through those doctrines

2657.76 --> 2665.28
like there's a paradox there guys

2661.599 --> 2665.28
did never thought of that

2666.16 --> 2669.48
it's really weird

2669.819 --> 2676.42
and that's why I mostly ignore all of it

2673.0 --> 2678.819
I ignore the prophecy in that sense and

2676.42 --> 2680.2000000000003
I just listened to the words of Jesus

2678.819 --> 2682.18
like

2680.2 --> 2684.0989999999997
whatever you think of everything that's

2682.18 --> 2685.96
happened in the Bible and the Old

2684.099 --> 2686.7400000000002
Testament like whatever is described in

2685.96 --> 2691.3
there

2686.74 --> 2694.4199999999996
every freaking time Jesus speaks up

2691.3 --> 2696.6400000000003
it's wisdom it's like a a fractal

2694.42 --> 2701.38
pattern that comes out of him and it it

2696.64 --> 2703.66
always works like it always works no

2701.38 --> 2706.48
exception it's like a pattern every time

2703.66 --> 2710.02
like that's the thing I follow that's

2706.48 --> 2713.2
the frequency that he dug up that he

2710.02 --> 2714.94
tapped into he found it he found the way

2713.2 --> 2715.72
through he found the pattern he found

2714.94 --> 2717.4
the

2715.72 --> 2720.3999999999996
the pure

2717.4 --> 2723.099
the pure strain of frequency

2720.4 --> 2725.859
and he lived it and everything he did

2723.099 --> 2729.54
became a fractal expression of that

2725.859 --> 2729.54
that's the thing I seek

2729.579 --> 2735.04
and it like has nothing to do really

2731.8 --> 2737.46
with anything that preceded the New

2735.04 --> 2737.46
Testament

2743.8 --> 2749.01
yeah and he definitely did not need to

2746.92 --> 2750.28
die

2749.01 --> 2753.5200000000004
[Music]

2750.28 --> 2755.8
the death did definitely not reinforce

2753.52 --> 2758.98
his wisdom or anything

2755.8 --> 2761.38
it just created a cult

2758.98 --> 2764.26
that eventually started claiming that he

2761.38 --> 2767.44
was God that died

2764.26 --> 2770.5200000000004
so that you're that so that you can live

2767.44 --> 2770.52
free as a devil

2801.95 --> 2805.06
[Music]

2814.839 --> 2819.54
thank Supreme I'm glad you appreciated

2817.24 --> 2819.54
it

2820.48 --> 2822.48
um

2846.09 --> 2850.42
[Music]

2848.079 --> 2852.579
what Christianity

2850.42 --> 2856.26
should really be

2852.579 --> 2856.26
what it actually should be

2856.3 --> 2859.26
in my opinion

2861.579 --> 2866.7400000000002
is a

2862.9 --> 2869.64
a general studying discipline

2866.74 --> 2869.64
primarily

2869.92 --> 2874.44
where people try to figure out

2875.02 --> 2880.66
the power of Christ like what he

2878.14 --> 2884.56
achieved

2880.66 --> 2889.18
and what he's doing and like to fully

2884.56 --> 2894.22
exploit and dedicate the exact teachings

2889.18 --> 2898.54
like [ __ ] Doctrine [ __ ] churches

2894.22 --> 2902.319
burn it all down for all I care

2898.54 --> 2906.099
the exact words the original Doctrine

2902.319 --> 2909.3
like what Jesus himself said

2906.099 --> 2912.94
that should be like studied massively

2909.3 --> 2915.88
maybe including algorithmic AI deep

2912.94 --> 2917.619
study pattern studies dude unleash the

2915.88 --> 2919.54
full works

2917.619 --> 2922.3
figure it out

2919.54 --> 2924.88
figure out what Jesus did

2922.3 --> 2928.0600000000004
and why it worked

2924.88 --> 2930.3
I think that is what Christianity should

2928.06 --> 2930.2999999999997
be

2930.4 --> 2933.359
so basically

2935.079 --> 2941.6400000000003
invite Jesus back into the realm

2938.56 --> 2941.64
through research

2941.8 --> 2946.619
to have

2943.42 --> 2946.619
his level

2946.8 --> 2950.44
rekindle

2948.7 --> 2954.819
in people

2950.44 --> 2958.0
through study to re-attain those mighty

2954.819 --> 2959.079
mighty powers that are available to

2958.0 --> 2963.96
those

2959.079 --> 2963.96
who are pure enough in the face of God

2964.54 --> 2969.64
yeah

2966.4 --> 2971.02
that's what I think Christianity should

2969.64 --> 2974.2
be

2971.02 --> 2976.9
and with it should definitely come like

2974.2 --> 2979.8999999999996
just good Community family community I

2976.9 --> 2982.839
mean I do like that part about church

2979.9 --> 2985.6600000000003
is that it's like all about family and

2982.839 --> 2987.5789999999997
like getting together and

2985.66 --> 2989.319
just community

2987.579 --> 2992.5
oriented

2989.319 --> 2995.64
socializing I mean I like that part

2992.5 --> 2995.64
it's a good thing

2997.24 --> 3003.5989999999997
but the problem has become the doctrine

3000.06 --> 3006.599
itself and how easily people

3003.599 --> 3009.42
just let their

3006.599 --> 3012.54
their Elders their superiors in church

3009.42 --> 3016.819
hierarchy just roll in complete

3012.54 --> 3016.819
horseshit start talking about

3017.7 --> 3024.54
about political related subjects and and

3021.3 --> 3027.0600000000004
talk nonsense about oh science all the

3024.54 --> 3030.24
science developments in the ball earth

3027.06 --> 3031.98
like oh my God how the hell did that

3030.24 --> 3033.9599999999996
ever slip in there

3031.98 --> 3037.02
it's because of ignorance it's because

3033.96 --> 3040.619
the people that are all doing it and

3037.02 --> 3042.839
they're doing right they don't know they

3040.619 --> 3047.579
just don't know because

3042.839 --> 3051.44
it has been not prioritized universally

3047.579 --> 3055.8
to really study like

3051.44 --> 3057.839
to study on Jesus himself and like and

3055.8 --> 3060.78
confrontation right it's not just about

3057.839 --> 3062.819
oh I want a nice book report I have a

3060.78 --> 3066.599
nice story I just read this I got really

3062.819 --> 3068.96
inspired no no it's about there's a

3066.599 --> 3074.04
struggle here

3068.96 --> 3075.66
and you people are turning a blind eye

3074.04 --> 3078.48
hmm

3075.66 --> 3082.7999999999997
face these words face this wisdom and

3078.48 --> 3084.0
now see how you have not applied them

3082.8 --> 3086.88
yeah

3084.0 --> 3089.22
that's what it should be

3086.88 --> 3093.44
confrontational

3089.22 --> 3093.4399999999996
a culture of Confrontation

3094.559 --> 3102.059
raising standards challenges

3099.24 --> 3104.8799999999997
lifelong challenges and the recognition

3102.059 --> 3107.4
of the struggle of the awakened man

3104.88 --> 3109.7400000000002
because if you're awake you're gonna be

3107.4 --> 3113.96
struggling you're gonna face the

3109.74 --> 3113.9599999999996
challenge that is there by Design

3115.98 --> 3122.599
such struggles must be respected should

3118.559 --> 3122.599
be respected by Christians

3125.28 --> 3128.7200000000003
so that is my view

3128.76 --> 3134.1800000000003
on how I think Christianity should have

3131.94 --> 3134.18
been

3134.7 --> 3142.3799999999997
but instead it's become this hermeneutic

3138.079 --> 3142.38
reversed World mockery

3142.559 --> 3147.8
where the key components of the belief

3145.559 --> 3151.7400000000002
that is like rammed in

3147.8 --> 3156.9
neurotically are literally direct

3151.74 --> 3159.0
violations of the original laws of God

3156.9 --> 3162.359
it's insane

3159.0 --> 3165.059
it's poison it's corrupted I mean it's

3162.359 --> 3167.88
literally that's corruption it's

3165.059 --> 3170.5400000000004
spiritual Corruption of the very core

3167.88 --> 3170.54
Doctrine

3173.819 --> 3176.819
foreign

3211.46 --> 3215.7200000000003
okay Supreme knowing

3215.76 --> 3218.3590000000004
foreign

3234.059 --> 3238.8
that's right singing star water it was

3236.22 --> 3239.75
it was not so much written it was

3238.8 --> 3243.96
assembled

3239.75 --> 3246.42
[Music]

3243.96 --> 3248.46
but so much was left out

3246.42 --> 3251.94
because it was assembled by basically

3248.46 --> 3254.579
people that were

3251.94 --> 3257.76
the Council of nicaea was effectively

3254.579 --> 3260.7200000000003
like a business

3257.76 --> 3260.7200000000003
arrangement

3261.599 --> 3264.6800000000003
people

3263.16 --> 3267.7799999999997
came together

3264.68 --> 3270.24
including all those things that like

3267.78 --> 3272.28
Jesus would have probably bitterly

3270.24 --> 3274.02
opposed and would have like rather like

3272.28 --> 3276.3
had them

3274.02 --> 3278.16
put in jail or something

3276.3 --> 3281.52
then to have to listen to them yeah

3278.16 --> 3283.2
those people like potentially all these

3281.52 --> 3286.68
spiritual

3283.2 --> 3288.96
argumentative Arch enemies of Jesus

3286.68 --> 3292.2599999999998
all had that opportunity to come

3288.96 --> 3296.339
together and then completely [ __ ] over

3292.26 --> 3300.3590000000004
everything that he originally wanted

3296.339 --> 3303.18
and to basically Assemble only things

3300.359 --> 3307.44
that Jesus Christ talked about

3303.18 --> 3309.72
that suited their Vision their vision

3307.44 --> 3312.78
for their religion

3309.72 --> 3314.9399999999996
for the Priestly religion with a pope

3312.78 --> 3317.8190000000004
huh

3314.94 --> 3320.7000000000003
it was like a business exploitation

3317.819 --> 3323.16
after his death is like oh how are we

3320.7 --> 3325.74
gonna use this like infinitely powerful

3323.16 --> 3329.22
wisdom

3325.74 --> 3330.4199999999996
to basically use put a cage around it

3329.22 --> 3332.7
and then

3330.42 --> 3335.579
keep it as a beacon

3332.7 --> 3337.5
to indoctrinate people into our religion

3335.579 --> 3340.94
so that when we can become the most

3337.5 --> 3340.94
powerful people in the world

3343.619 --> 3350.339
that's the Council of nicaea

3346.5 --> 3352.2
probably all of Jesus's like traditional

3350.339 --> 3354.98
Arch enemies

3352.2 --> 3354.98
came together

3356.22 --> 3363.66
to do that

3358.68 --> 3366.2999999999997
and to rewrite it all in their way how

3363.66 --> 3369.5589999999997
they wanted Christianity to be seen not

3366.3 --> 3369.559
the way Jesus said

3393.14 --> 3400.52
no Maximus flatius is I don't want to

3397.14 --> 3400.52
talk about that what the hell

3408.18 --> 3413.22
like the book of quotes not being

3410.099 --> 3416.78
written by the people being quoted yeah

3413.22 --> 3416.7799999999997
exactly iron 26.

3427.74 --> 3431.359
that's right Adam meakin

3433.079 --> 3435.92
good morning

3437.54 --> 3444.069
good see you by the way

3441.05 --> 3444.069
[Music]

3447.18 --> 3452.16
Council of knightsia is the Council of

3449.88 --> 3454.44
the Lucifer

3452.16 --> 3456.839
I mean it freaking is

3454.44 --> 3459.0
Council of nicaea is the Council of

3456.839 --> 3460.619
Lucifer they literally destroyed

3459.0 --> 3463.44
Christianity

3460.619 --> 3467.78
the real Christianity that we barely

3463.44 --> 3467.78
know about now thanks to them

3469.14 --> 3476.22
we only have to skeletal Remnant work

3472.619 --> 3477.839
that they saw fit to take from Jesus

3476.22 --> 3480.18
original wisdom

3477.839 --> 3483.48
for their own exploits that's the only

3480.18 --> 3486.5989999999997
stuff that we even know and it by itself

3483.48 --> 3488.76
is already magnificent because whatever

3486.599 --> 3492.54
Jesus says

3488.76 --> 3494.6400000000003
it has this fractal wisdom to it

3492.54 --> 3497.339
so even if you stripped it all down to

3494.64 --> 3499.92
just a few words those few words still

3497.339 --> 3501.7799999999997
retain their power

3499.92 --> 3504.5
but if this is not the original

3501.78 --> 3504.5
teachings

3516.72 --> 3522.9599999999996
that's right flutter Sage well

3521.04 --> 3524.94
Maybe

3522.96 --> 3527.16
the point is is that

3524.94 --> 3529.859
it would be kind of cool if there was

3527.16 --> 3531.54
like a synopsis Bible with just Jesus's

3529.859 --> 3534.5989999999997
words I'm not saying that that should

3531.54 --> 3538.319
replace the entire Bible

3534.599 --> 3541.4
but it would be kind of cool

3538.319 --> 3541.4
to have such a book

3560.04 --> 3566.18
yeah that's right woodworking gummy bear

3562.14 --> 3566.18
absolutely yeah the confessionals

3566.7 --> 3573.0589999999997
I mean

3568.559 --> 3576.02
the thing is confessing your sins

3573.059 --> 3576.02
is healthy

3577.2 --> 3582.02
but who are you confessing to right

3583.319 --> 3589.5
like if you're gonna if there is a

3585.66 --> 3592.859
central Corporation as it were that

3589.5 --> 3595.26
takes confessions well of course they're

3592.859 --> 3597.299
gonna freaking use it then

3595.26 --> 3600.0
they're gonna use it

3597.299 --> 3602.52
for Espionage and stuff

3600.0 --> 3605.7
of course they will

3602.52 --> 3607.44
right so that's not what confession

3605.7 --> 3610.3799999999997
should be about

3607.44 --> 3613.92
confession shouldn't be in secret the

3610.38 --> 3618.96
whole point of redemption is that you

3613.92 --> 3621.42
openly share it to the world it's like I

3618.96 --> 3623.52
sinned I did this thing and I'm really

3621.42 --> 3627.119
ashamed am I gonna do my best and never

3623.52 --> 3628.92
do that again yeah that's confession

3627.119 --> 3631.7400000000002
isn't like

3628.92 --> 3635.099
going to a little boxy like nobody tells

3631.74 --> 3637.68
I'm actually squirting and oh like

3635.099 --> 3640.38
that's what the [ __ ] is the point you're

3637.68 --> 3642.68
gonna keep it a secret the point is is

3640.38 --> 3648.0
that you

3642.68 --> 3650.5789999999997
openly confess you say it to the world

3648.0 --> 3653.28
and now the world has seated now you

3650.579 --> 3656.579
can't keep it a secret anymore

3653.28 --> 3659.1600000000003
now your sin is in the open and that is

3656.579 --> 3661.3390000000004
a lot more motivating to really work on

3659.16 --> 3661.339
it

3664.2 --> 3668.1189999999997
so it's it's just practically

3668.16 --> 3673.3799999999997
right this is how I think every time

3670.44 --> 3676.98
it's like how do things work

3673.38 --> 3680.46
why do Jesus's teachings work why does

3676.98 --> 3683.579
all these God rules work it's because

3680.46 --> 3686.16
that's what happens

3683.579 --> 3688.319
it's not because oh if you don't know

3686.16 --> 3691.02
the rules or you certainly get cursed or

3688.319 --> 3695.22
something no it's

3691.02 --> 3698.78
the rules are because of what happens

3695.22 --> 3698.7799999999997
when you don't do that

3700.92 --> 3705.119
that's when you like invoke the curses

3703.619 --> 3707.1600000000003
on you

3705.119 --> 3709.98
because you're doing it wrong you're not

3707.16 --> 3712.0789999999997
following God's rules that's what it

3709.98 --> 3713.7
really is

3712.079 --> 3717.26
and

3713.7 --> 3719.3999999999996
in secret confessing your sin to some

3717.26 --> 3721.7990000000004
professional for that

3719.4 --> 3723.48
is the only thing is going to happen is

3721.799 --> 3725.96
their secret service that's what it's

3723.48 --> 3725.96
gonna happen

3726.839 --> 3731.16
yeah and they can use that what you're

3729.299 --> 3733.68
confessing for all kinds of things they

3731.16 --> 3735.66
can use it for General psychological

3733.68 --> 3737.94
assessment like what is the state of the

3735.66 --> 3739.74
mind of people on average they can keep

3737.94 --> 3741.119
track of that just because of

3739.74 --> 3743.2799999999997
confessions

3741.119 --> 3744.78
and they can keep like possession

3743.28 --> 3747.7200000000003
secrets

3744.78 --> 3749.52
right and they can recruit Specialists

3747.72 --> 3751.5789999999997
like thieves

3749.52 --> 3755.46
that are gonna like yeah I stole again

3751.579 --> 3758.28
and literally sometimes it's like oh we

3755.46 --> 3759.119
have this the Lord has a special job for

3758.28 --> 3763.44
you

3759.119 --> 3765.0
yeah they recruit from their Sinners to

3763.44 --> 3768.54
use them

3765.0 --> 3770.28
for their sin that also happens like all

3768.54 --> 3773.2799999999997
these things happen because of

3770.28 --> 3776.2200000000003
confessional systems

3773.28 --> 3780.299
it's ridiculous a sin

3776.22 --> 3783.0
should be denounced openly should be

3780.299 --> 3785.16
confessed to the public openly so that

3783.0 --> 3786.599
you let everybody know this is what I

3785.16 --> 3790.74
did

3786.599 --> 3792.96
and I wish to stop it yeah redeem not to

3790.74 --> 3795.1189999999997
keep it a secret and then I hope you

3792.96 --> 3798.119
don't do it over and over and over and

3795.119 --> 3799.559
over and over again no you publicly

3798.119 --> 3801.9
confess it

3799.559 --> 3804.92
and then you take that burden that comes

3801.9 --> 3804.92
with that the judgment

3806.64 --> 3813.54
and then you redeem you do your best

3811.26 --> 3815.88
that's how it should be

3813.54 --> 3818.7599999999998
right because if you publicly confess it

3815.88 --> 3820.98
then you're not so much exploitable

3818.76 --> 3823.38
anymore like if you publicly confess

3820.98 --> 3825.48
like yeah I'm secretly a thief and I

3823.38 --> 3827.1600000000003
can't help it and it's still this and

3825.48 --> 3829.859
that and that like

3827.16 --> 3831.839
it's not very likely that somebody there

3829.859 --> 3834.0589999999997
is gonna come to you and then say like

3831.839 --> 3836.46
hey I got a secret job for you

3834.059 --> 3839.119
because everybody knows it now about

3836.46 --> 3839.119
that person

3840.24 --> 3845.52
so

3842.94 --> 3848.2200000000003
it doesn't work that way see but if you

3845.52 --> 3850.799
secretly confess it to his own priest in

3848.22 --> 3854.18
a little box nobody knows about well

3850.799 --> 3856.68
then it's very easy to recruit them

3854.18 --> 3858.96
nobody's the wiser because only the

3856.68 --> 3860.16
priests know that they're thieves

3858.96 --> 3862.819
yeah

3860.16 --> 3862.819
it's

3863.28 --> 3867.3190000000004
confession should not be private

3876.54 --> 3880.64
sins are between you and God

3884.76 --> 3889.92
sure well you're not saying that you

3886.859 --> 3891.359
must confess to another person but I

3889.92 --> 3895.079
mean if you're gonna do it then you

3891.359 --> 3898.16
should confess it openly

3895.079 --> 3898.1600000000003
that's the whole point

3900.54 --> 3907.319
like if something is burdening you

3903.599 --> 3909.96
what is that you need to share it

3907.319 --> 3913.2
well then don't share it with somebody

3909.96 --> 3915.7200000000003
in secret share it

3913.2 --> 3918.18
with your community with your friends

3915.72 --> 3921.9199999999996
with everybody that you know that's who

3918.18 --> 3921.9199999999996
you want to confess it to anyway

3922.079 --> 3925.619
you want it to be known that's why it's

3924.24 --> 3929.7799999999997
burdening you

3925.619 --> 3929.78
then share it don't do it in secret

3941.819 --> 3947.0589999999997
right yeah good glad you get it

3950.7 --> 3956.0989999999997
I'm not saying that you have to like

3952.859 --> 3958.44
literally continually spout every

3956.099 --> 3960.079
freaking sin you do or something that

3958.44 --> 3963.359
you have to

3960.079 --> 3967.26
let me share my daily sins and then like

3963.359 --> 3970.319
work a list off every that's pointless

3967.26 --> 3972.0
it's when it's on you where why do

3970.319 --> 3974.22
people go to confessionals because they

3972.0 --> 3975.9
got something on them it's burning them

3974.22 --> 3977.3999999999996
it's like a weight and they need the

3975.9 --> 3980.099
weight of the chest they need to share

3977.4 --> 3983.2200000000003
it that's why they do it

3980.099 --> 3986.2200000000003
oh then share it

3983.22 --> 3986.22
openly

3993.24 --> 3997.74
or if it might completely destroy

3996.18 --> 4000.819
somebody's life

3997.74 --> 4000.819
well then it's different

4001.039 --> 4005.92
then

4002.319 --> 4009.079
logically you'd have to like face them

4005.92 --> 4010.819
and say like I saw this about you I'm

4009.079 --> 4013.579
worried

4010.819 --> 4015.68
I think you're doing a sin and I want

4013.579 --> 4018.099
you to admit that

4015.68 --> 4018.0989999999997
right

4018.559 --> 4023.7200000000003
like if you find out a sin about so like

4021.559 --> 4024.799
somebody's like cheating or whatever you

4023.72 --> 4027.319
think

4024.799 --> 4029.839
you don't just like oh the next time in

4027.319 --> 4032.0589999999997
church you just like he's cheating and

4029.839 --> 4033.5589999999997
like yeah that's gonna completely [ __ ]

4032.059 --> 4035.7200000000003
up everything

4033.559 --> 4037.7000000000003
that's going to have like a massive

4035.72 --> 4040.8799999999997
spiritual wound left

4037.7 --> 4042.859
then you should do that

4040.88 --> 4045.2200000000003
it's about confessing about your own

4042.859 --> 4045.22
sins

4045.859 --> 4050.48
shouldn't just confess somebody else's

4048.14 --> 4053.18
sin in public like that that that's that

4050.48 --> 4054.859
would be very destructive

4053.18 --> 4057.7
and disruptive

4054.859 --> 4057.7
so yeah

4068.0 --> 4072.039
yeah woodworking yeah I know

4072.98 --> 4077.98
the middleman thing yeah it's ridiculous

4079.28 --> 4085.8190000000004
there is no middle man

4082.24 --> 4088.18
every man and woman and child is a

4085.819 --> 4088.18
middleman

4090.98 --> 4096.92
in my view when we speak

4094.28 --> 4098.900000000001
to others

4096.92 --> 4101.779
especially when they're multiple people

4098.9 --> 4104.66
we actually speak to God

4101.779 --> 4107.839000000001
not because those little pieces of

4104.66 --> 4112.719
Consciousness or the egos are God but

4107.839 --> 4112.719
because God listens through people

4115.52 --> 4120.1990000000005
and the more people are listening the

4118.219 --> 4122.779
more you get God's air that's kind of

4120.199 --> 4125.919999999999
how I see it in a way

4122.779 --> 4130.6990000000005
it's like God listens in

4125.92 --> 4130.6990000000005
through people everywhere

4131.0 --> 4137.719
not just only those priests

4134.66 --> 4139.639999999999
no through all of them like even if

4137.719 --> 4141.38
those people have no developed

4139.64 --> 4143.900000000001
Consciousness or whatever they're not

4141.38 --> 4145.6990000000005
they're kind of dumb doesn't matter

4143.9 --> 4148.94
God will

4145.699 --> 4152.199
have this little listening device

4148.94 --> 4155.12
basically listening in through their his

4152.199 --> 4157.94
Universal Godly spy device that is

4155.12 --> 4160.04
basically that's like

4157.94 --> 4165.58
that's there

4160.04 --> 4165.58
was designed into into life itself

4165.859 --> 4171.08
yeah I I'm taking it off in a bit of a

4168.98 --> 4172.699
weird Direction because

4171.08 --> 4175.4
but you know what I mean it's just God

4172.699 --> 4177.98
can listen through any person

4175.4 --> 4180.259
so it's like when I address God when I'm

4177.98 --> 4182.419999999999
trying to talk to God I either talk to

4180.259 --> 4184.88
the air

4182.42 --> 4187.58
and then I am

4184.88 --> 4190.1
the thing that God is listening to so

4187.58 --> 4191.96
I'm talking to the air and God will be

4190.1 --> 4194.780000000001
listening through me

4191.96 --> 4198.8
that's how I see it

4194.78 --> 4202.34
or I talk to multiple people and then

4198.8 --> 4205.9400000000005
get basically multiple of God's ears and

4202.34 --> 4207.9800000000005
the more ears the more clearly what you

4205.94 --> 4210.879999999999
put down becomes

4207.98 --> 4210.879999999999
official

4211.58 --> 4217.28
so that's kind of like how I see that

4214.94 --> 4221.178999999999
hope you guys understand

4217.28 --> 4223.58
might be a bit ethereal to you I hope I

4221.179 --> 4225.6990000000005
got it I hope I explained it clearly

4223.58 --> 4225.699
enough

4225.98 --> 4230.0199999999995
if not just tell me in the chat

4234.38 --> 4238.04
um

4235.94 --> 4240.699
get some of this Rook

4238.04 --> 4240.699
wow

4246.44 --> 4251.599999999999
or just not talk for five minutes

4248.6 --> 4253.900000000001
straight and then just leave that's fine

4251.6 --> 4253.900000000001
too

4264.44 --> 4267.44
hmm

4277.82 --> 4283.099999999999
whoa

4279.739 --> 4284.659
man this more grown Rook last really

4283.1 --> 4287.38
intense

4284.659 --> 4287.379999999999
poof

4297.49 --> 4300.5199999999995
[Music]

4333.13 --> 4336.27
[Music]

4344.3 --> 4347.08
down

4363.04 --> 4367.179
what am I going to title this thing

4368.42 --> 4374.78
it's all been very

4371.239 --> 4377.32
Christianity orientated and very [ __ ]

4374.78 --> 4377.32
sake come on

4384.5 --> 4390.52
wow eight minutes later did everybody

4387.56 --> 4390.52
just leave

4390.86 --> 4396.099999999999
did I go too far or something what the

4393.26 --> 4396.1
hell's going on here

4420.32 --> 4422.62
foreign

4432.52 --> 4438.159000000001
medication really

4435.14 --> 4438.159000000001
what the hell

4442.76 --> 4449.679
oh your power was out okay

4446.78 --> 4449.679
that's intense

4472.58 --> 4475.94
but I mean slow-mo moon buggy

4474.32 --> 4478.4
technically

4475.94 --> 4480.32
you could say that it is kind of logical

4478.4 --> 4483.739
though I mean because people that are

4480.32 --> 4486.08
still like afraid of that [ __ ]

4483.739 --> 4488.299999999999
I mean they're gonna be needing

4486.08 --> 4490.46
antidepressants probably no matter what

4488.3 --> 4492.7390000000005
I mean you're if you're they're arranged

4490.46 --> 4494.78
and dilapidated enough to still believe

4492.739 --> 4496.639999999999
that garbage

4494.78 --> 4498.5
you would typically go for

4496.64 --> 4501.219
antidepressants then

4498.5 --> 4501.219
I'd say

4515.9 --> 4521.679
psych meds for

4518.06 --> 4521.679
abdominal issues okay

4524.54 --> 4527.54
ridiculous

4541.54 --> 4549.159
Neil deGrasse Tyson claims John referent

4545.84 --> 4549.159000000001
John Mitchell was black

4549.34 --> 4552.9400000000005
uh okay

4555.739 --> 4559.0
does it matter

4569.0 --> 4575.8
and to depressively but well yeah the

4571.52 --> 4575.8
old ones well they are all basically

4610.34 --> 4612.9400000000005
okay

4629.8 --> 4636.02
foreign I mean yeah oh a priest tells us

4634.34 --> 4639.46
we're on the globe well surprise

4636.02 --> 4639.46
surprise they invented it

4640.82 --> 4646.84
don't know what else to tell you what

4644.12 --> 4646.84
they did

4677.199 --> 4685.12
right I mean

4681.14 --> 4685.12
I've said it a while ago

4686.179 --> 4691.82
is that

4688.1 --> 4694.04
the globe religion is basically just the

4691.82 --> 4698.0199999999995
natural Next Step

4694.04 --> 4698.0199999999995
from what they did with Christianity

4699.89 --> 4702.969
[Music]

4706.719 --> 4709.719
all right

4710.54 --> 4715.5199999999995
first they they corrupt

4713.08 --> 4717.86
Christianity itself

4715.52 --> 4720.7390000000005
and replace it

4717.86 --> 4722.96
and then from within the replacement

4720.739 --> 4724.4
created theocracy and then use the

4722.96 --> 4726.7390000000005
theocracy

4724.4 --> 4730.28
to

4726.739 --> 4732.199
erase a bunch of knowledge and wisdom

4730.28 --> 4734.96
and shamanic stuff all over the world

4732.199 --> 4737.659
yeah the infamous Jesuit

4734.96 --> 4740.0
trips around the world pretty much

4737.659 --> 4743.5599999999995
destroying all religions

4740.0 --> 4743.56
that were actually useful

4745.88 --> 4751.4800000000005
and then they came suddenly

4749.54 --> 4754.58
with a bunch of

4751.48 --> 4756.86
astronomical based

4754.58 --> 4758.9
Global [ __ ]

4756.86 --> 4761.36
start to use math

4758.9 --> 4766.12
an astrology

4761.36 --> 4766.12
to create this fictional world

4767.78 --> 4771.099999999999
that's what they did

4774.56 --> 4780.14
Jesuit priests

4777.199 --> 4782.98
they crafted it they crafted the

4780.14 --> 4782.9800000000005
mathematics of it

4786.739 --> 4792.139999999999
and then the history book says although

4789.08 --> 4794.78
they were pioneers and they were

4792.14 --> 4797.719
persecuted by the church [ __ ]

4794.78 --> 4799.759999999999
they were protected by the church

4797.719 --> 4803.6
and they were highly

4799.76 --> 4806.719
looked down upon and hated by the actual

4803.6 --> 4808.1
Christian public yeah that's how it

4806.719 --> 4809.96
really was

4808.1 --> 4812.360000000001
not the other way around they were not

4809.96 --> 4814.1
some Grassroots people that were beloved

4812.36 --> 4816.38
Smarties

4814.1 --> 4817.9400000000005
and the church was gonna persecute them

4816.38 --> 4820.159000000001
[ __ ]

4817.94 --> 4821.719
they were literally in the church and

4820.159 --> 4825.879999999999
they were protected they were like a

4821.719 --> 4825.88
protected class by the freaking Church

4826.159 --> 4832.0
it was nonsense about persecution is

4828.56 --> 4832.0
absolute horseshit

4832.76 --> 4836.5
don't believe a word of it

4846.76 --> 4857.900000000001
right so yeah ball religion came out of

4852.4 --> 4861.5
Christ's idolatry her manuedics religion

4857.9 --> 4864.4
the nicerian religion

4861.5 --> 4864.4
who they should call it

4879.44 --> 4884.0199999999995
um

4880.42 --> 4884.02
I'll be right back

4947.48 --> 4950.139999999999
foreign

4999.92 --> 5002.58
I thought

5004.4 --> 5009.239
[Music]

5006.04 --> 5009.239
in the back

5028.06 --> 5032.9800000000005
you guys remember when I did shows about

5030.34 --> 5035.08
this must have been years ago now where

5032.98 --> 5038.86
I basically laid it out

5035.08 --> 5041.5
the four consecutive steps

5038.86 --> 5046.299999999999
first they corrupt Christ then they

5041.5 --> 5050.56
corrupt like the very image of the world

5046.3 --> 5050.56
then they like introduce

5053.199 --> 5057.339999999999
like the whole

5054.88 --> 5059.1990000000005
like they erase the past like create

5057.34 --> 5061.3
yeah they erase the past create

5059.199 --> 5065.04
dinosaurs and all that [ __ ] and take

5061.3 --> 5065.04
away the Giants

5065.32 --> 5071.0199999999995
and then eventually you get like they

5068.5 --> 5073.0
take away the Family itself

5071.02 --> 5075.6990000000005
and like

5073.0 --> 5078.48
try to basically create mind control

5075.699 --> 5078.48
communism

5080.38 --> 5084.12
right so that's the third one

5086.739 --> 5092.5599999999995
so it's like they take away

5089.08 --> 5095.14
Christ wisdom

5092.56 --> 5096.46
and create a priesthood then from within

5095.14 --> 5099.6990000000005
the priesthood

5096.46 --> 5102.1
they create a reversed world

5099.699 --> 5106.86
a different cosmology that effectively

5102.1 --> 5106.860000000001
denies God it's crazy that that happened

5110.699 --> 5115.32
then they start to cover up the past

5125.46 --> 5132.3
and yeah things like social engineering

5128.8 --> 5132.3
communism mind control

5136.0 --> 5139.56
and that's how we got here

5142.239 --> 5148.0199999999995
right and the last step would be like

5145.0 --> 5150.88
the final would be like pure

5148.02 --> 5152.7390000000005
transhumanism basically it is the final

5150.88 --> 5155.08
step is like oh

5152.739 --> 5157.718999999999
making a robot and we're gonna upload

5155.08 --> 5160.62
your Consciousness into it and you die

5157.719 --> 5160.62
effectively

5160.659 --> 5164.92
or potentially even like trap your

5163.0 --> 5167.199
Consciousness if it would actually work

5164.92 --> 5169.96
then yeah how about having your

5167.199 --> 5172.32
Consciousness trapped within an undying

5169.96 --> 5172.32
body

5177.46 --> 5182.139
you think that would upset the natural

5179.679 --> 5185.159
Order of Things

5182.139 --> 5185.159000000001
I would

5188.8 --> 5194.02
I mean it's certainly gonna prevent your

5191.56 --> 5196.0
Consciousness from reincarnating

5194.02 --> 5197.88
what'll happen when you no longer

5196.0 --> 5200.08
reincarnate when you're as a ghost

5197.88 --> 5202.42
trapped in a box

5200.08 --> 5204.34
within the material plane what happens

5202.42 --> 5207.04
what happens to the universe what

5204.34 --> 5208.719
happens to God's design

5207.04 --> 5211.86
when sadly

5208.719 --> 5215.76
souls are basically prevented from

5211.86 --> 5215.759999999999
reincarnating yeah

5216.4 --> 5221.799999999999
think that could have a negative impact

5218.8 --> 5221.8
perhaps

5239.32 --> 5243.699
personally you think God May create an

5242.02 --> 5246.219
alternative realm where everybody lives

5243.699 --> 5250.5599999999995
no no

5246.219 --> 5250.56
it's impossible you see

5251.739 --> 5258.04
God didn't yeah he technically didn't

5254.56 --> 5261.1
create the laws of physics

5258.04 --> 5262.6
the laws of physics just is

5261.1 --> 5267.04
God

5262.6 --> 5270.159000000001
simply arranged everything

5267.04 --> 5272.4
so that things would work the way they

5270.159 --> 5272.4
work

5274.719 --> 5277.38
no

5278.02 --> 5282.76
I mean some things might just be like

5280.659 --> 5286.299999999999
controllable with like a lever it's like

5282.76 --> 5289.06
oh insert more of this and then like

5286.3 --> 5291.159000000001
God's like oh yeah just insert this but

5289.06 --> 5294.400000000001
I mean most things just work the way

5291.159 --> 5295.719
they do because that's how matter works

5294.4 --> 5298.62
I think

5295.719 --> 5301.6
I'm not sure if God like literally

5298.62 --> 5303.639
created the laws of nature I think that

5301.6 --> 5306.639
the laws of nature kind of always were

5303.639 --> 5309.219
and naturally we're gonna be

5306.639 --> 5313.139
with the existence of matter it's like

5309.219 --> 5313.139
the side effect of matter itself

5314.5 --> 5320.38
like why would you believe that God

5316.84 --> 5323.02
literally had like dial control on every

5320.38 --> 5325.12
detail like it was a computer game

5323.02 --> 5328.080000000001
construction kit they're just like oh

5325.12 --> 5328.08
I'm gonna just do this

5328.659 --> 5333.46
no

5331.179 --> 5336.159
I think everything works the way it does

5333.46 --> 5338.639
because that's simply how matter is

5336.159 --> 5338.638999999999
itself

5341.26 --> 5346.0
and you could say then from that

5343.3 --> 5349.02
perspective that God did not yeah

5346.0 --> 5352.98
I didn't create the laws he simply

5349.02 --> 5352.9800000000005
revealed the loss

5355.0 --> 5362.199
natural law was revealed upon its

5359.199 --> 5362.199
manifestation

5363.58 --> 5368.44
why would you think that God just I'm

5365.86 --> 5370.719
gonna create manner blue and then just

5368.44 --> 5372.28
like oh after tweak it like get it get

5370.719 --> 5374.8
the laws of like how are we gonna

5372.28 --> 5378.28
stabilize this any story of that no

5374.8 --> 5381.04
it just works

5378.28 --> 5384.099999999999
the laws of matter are the laws of

5381.04 --> 5386.639
matter because it's how matter is that's

5384.1 --> 5386.639
what I think

5391.3 --> 5397.12
it was up to God to find the balance

5394.06 --> 5400.120000000001
between the matter like his design

5397.12 --> 5404.38
was instantaneous it was there and it

5400.12 --> 5406.48
was based on how he knew matter was

5404.38 --> 5409.06
so

5406.48 --> 5411.58
I don't think God set the laws of matter

5409.06 --> 5414.280000000001
I think the laws of matter are always

5411.58 --> 5417.46
were always there

5414.28 --> 5419.349999999999
but he did manifest matter in order to

5417.46 --> 5421.96
reveal those laws basically

5419.35 --> 5424.7390000000005
[Music]

5421.96 --> 5424.7390000000005
I don't know

5424.84 --> 5432.3
yeah and God could create no it can't

5427.9 --> 5432.299999999999
because it's a ridiculous fantasy

5433.12 --> 5439.86
a spinning ball can't be created because

5435.94 --> 5439.86
that's not how anything works

5441.28 --> 5446.98
it can't be made to work it doesn't work

5444.46 --> 5449.02
the only way it works is through

5446.98 --> 5454.0
illusion

5449.02 --> 5455.38
in our fantasy where laws of physics are

5454.0 --> 5458.04
not relevant

5455.38 --> 5458.04
you see

5458.38 --> 5464.4400000000005
we can make things work however we want

5461.08 --> 5467.08
it in our fantasy

5464.44 --> 5472.138999999999
we're not tied down by the standard

5467.08 --> 5472.139
mechanisms of physics within our dreams

5475.42 --> 5481.36
only snow globes and rectangular looping

5479.02 --> 5484.1990000000005
loopings can be created

5481.36 --> 5484.199
uh

5484.239 --> 5490.299999999999
yeah perhaps

5487.06 --> 5494.26
but the point is is that those designs

5490.3 --> 5498.54
are simply there to accommodate how

5494.26 --> 5498.54
matter already would work

5498.76 --> 5504.52
a globe

5500.92 --> 5506.62
the way you arranged the globe design

5504.52 --> 5509.26
being all pulled towards the center of

5506.62 --> 5510.34
earth that is something that cannot be

5509.26 --> 5512.52
made

5510.34 --> 5512.52
important

5513.239 --> 5517.239
especially naturally

5519.94 --> 5525.4
that's the thing that cannot be made God

5523.12 --> 5526.84
can't make a spinning ball Earth in a

5525.4 --> 5530.5
vacuum

5526.84 --> 5532.360000000001
with with gravity supposedly pulling

5530.5 --> 5533.199
everything towards the center of the

5532.36 --> 5535.54
ball

5533.199 --> 5536.799999999999
except everything else in the universe

5535.54 --> 5539.92
yeah

5536.8 --> 5543.28
God can't make that because that's not

5539.92 --> 5548.02
how matter Works cannot be made to work

5543.28 --> 5551.199
like that like we can't even make it if

5548.02 --> 5553.5
we as people can't even make anything

5551.199 --> 5557.44
like that we can only

5553.5 --> 5560.44
visually show something that resembles

5557.44 --> 5563.199
it like on a TV screen

5560.44 --> 5565.719
yeah well why do you think that we can't

5563.199 --> 5568.659
actually make it is because it's

5565.719 --> 5570.699
physically impossible

5568.659 --> 5575.5599999999995
it cannot be made

5570.699 --> 5577.78
matter cannot be made to work like that

5575.56 --> 5580.8
no matter what you do

5577.78 --> 5580.8
that's why

5592.239 --> 5598.199
you're good to do anything okay except

5595.0 --> 5598.199
after cute

5604.08 --> 5609.04
yeah but the point is ftappy is that you

5607.0 --> 5611.32
don't teleport

5609.04 --> 5612.699
there is no teleport there's just a

5611.32 --> 5614.98
continuum

5612.699 --> 5616.12
there is no teleportation there is no

5614.98 --> 5619.0599999999995
portal

5616.12 --> 5622.0599999999995
the entire realm is the portal that's

5619.06 --> 5625.6
the point of a looping system

5622.06 --> 5627.88
it's a wormhole it's a continuum

5625.6 --> 5631.659000000001
there is no teleport

5627.88 --> 5634.5
it's just that that's how space itself

5631.659 --> 5634.5
is arranged

5634.54 --> 5640.96
and it doesn't have any influences or

5638.26 --> 5643.3
anything that you can see about it you'd

5640.96 --> 5645.76
live in it and you'd never find out that

5643.3 --> 5649.719
it was looping

5645.76 --> 5652.12
unless you travel huge distances and and

5649.719 --> 5654.46
come to the conclusion wait how did I

5652.12 --> 5657.34
come back to the same spot working in a

5654.46 --> 5659.02
dead dead reckoning straight line

5657.34 --> 5661.54
and then you can figure out like there's

5659.02 --> 5663.46
something surreal Happening Here

5661.54 --> 5667.26
is this looping

5663.46 --> 5667.26
yeah there's no teleportation

5670.48 --> 5676.9
you can't make a wormallow either

5674.02 --> 5679.4800000000005
who cares

5676.9 --> 5683.0199999999995
we can measure it though

5679.48 --> 5688.48
yeah it does comport the setup of it

5683.02 --> 5691.2390000000005
does comport to well it being here yeah

5688.48 --> 5694.78
it's still a possibility that the Earth

5691.239 --> 5697.0
is definitely looping

5694.78 --> 5700.0599999999995
east to west that is definitely

5697.0 --> 5703.0
something that we can falsify

5700.06 --> 5704.620000000001
to see whether that is true or not

5703.0 --> 5708.1
yeah

5704.62 --> 5711.219
one thing we already know is definitely

5708.1 --> 5715.719
not true is that the Earth is a globe

5711.219 --> 5720.12
because there is no curvature at all

5715.719 --> 5723.219
yeah so we don't need to falsify that

5720.12 --> 5726.94
it's already been disproven

5723.219 --> 5730.54
yeah looping realm no no you haven't

5726.94 --> 5732.58
disproven that at all we have disproven

5730.54 --> 5733.36
the ball being the Earth being of all

5732.58 --> 5736.32
though

5733.36 --> 5736.32
that Debbie

5746.26 --> 5748.7390000000005
like

5770.44 --> 5774.659
video game designer standpoint

5774.76 --> 5778.139
well what about it

5780.34 --> 5787.179
how many people use a a ball

5784.6 --> 5790.0
for their games for the actual game

5787.179 --> 5794.6990000000005
design because

5790.0 --> 5794.699
you know from what I've learned

5794.739 --> 5799.178999999999
about video games in general is what

5797.02 --> 5802.2390000000005
they usually do

5799.179 --> 5806.4400000000005
is they have a compartmentalization just

5802.239 --> 5810.5199999999995
like in movies huh there's the oh we're

5806.44 --> 5814.0599999999995
in outer space with balls ball here ball

5810.52 --> 5816.6990000000005
now oh Big Balls mobile Moon whatever

5814.06 --> 5820.780000000001
but then like oh there's something built

5816.699 --> 5825.099999999999
on these balls oh okay okay well let's

5820.78 --> 5826.659
go into the atmosphere oh and then we

5825.1 --> 5828.639
arrive in a flat realm where

5826.659 --> 5831.099999999999
everything's flat because that's how it

5828.639 --> 5834.400000000001
really looks that's how you actually

5831.1 --> 5836.04
design things yeah they never have

5834.4 --> 5840.12
actual

5836.04 --> 5840.12
architectures on balls

5840.46 --> 5845.92
in video games

5843.639 --> 5848.32
or in movies

5845.92 --> 5850.56
that's they compartmentalize it yeah

5848.32 --> 5855.34
they never show you

5850.56 --> 5855.34
architecture on planets

5855.52 --> 5862.900000000001
from outside of the atmosphere they

5858.76 --> 5866.5
don't do that they just show you hey a

5862.9 --> 5868.36
ball there's stuff on it and then oh

5866.5 --> 5870.76
we're getting into the atmosphere oh

5868.36 --> 5872.5
look oh we've arrived look at this

5870.76 --> 5875.92
massive flat plane with all this

5872.5 --> 5878.02
architecture and all this nature on a

5875.92 --> 5881.639
flat plane yeah that's what they do

5878.02 --> 5881.639
because that's how it works

5882.219 --> 5890.86
if you'd see architecture on a ball from

5886.9 --> 5892.599999999999
the outside and you slowly zoom in you

5890.86 --> 5894.759999999999
fly there supposedly within the

5892.6 --> 5898.719
simulation within the game

5894.76 --> 5901.719
it looks unbelievably unnatural

5898.719 --> 5904.84
you'd start to feel sick

5901.719 --> 5907.0
because it looks so unbelievably

5904.84 --> 5909.52
unnatural because the Earth isn't a ball

5907.0 --> 5911.739
and you'd immediately feel that like

5909.52 --> 5913.360000000001
we're approaching something that's not

5911.739 --> 5916.0
natural

5913.36 --> 5918.759999999999
because you don't approach a ball

5916.0 --> 5922.84
never do you approach a ball

5918.76 --> 5925.780000000001
you always approach a giant flat plane

5922.84 --> 5926.9800000000005
and if you don't approach a giant flat

5925.78 --> 5929.259999999999
plane

5926.98 --> 5931.239
you'll start to feel really [ __ ] up

5929.26 --> 5932.8
because like there's something really

5931.239 --> 5935.62
wrong here

5932.8 --> 5937.3
like my mind is bending

5935.62 --> 5939.94
that's what you start to feel then

5937.3 --> 5942.76
because the Earth is flat and all our

5939.94 --> 5946.48
senses have been programmed to accept

5942.76 --> 5951.780000000001
that it is flat and when it isn't flat

5946.48 --> 5951.78
it'll start to feel really unnatural

5960.699 --> 5963.178999999999
foreign

5979.9 --> 5984.54
God can override buoyancy yeah whatever

6003.36 --> 6005.9
what

6009.06 --> 6013.860000000001
oh you're referencing marks I did yeah

6011.94 --> 6018.54
that's fine no but there's a good point

6013.86 --> 6020.58
I mean video game designing is very

6018.54 --> 6023.1
relevant

6020.58 --> 6027.659
it's relevant to understanding of

6023.1 --> 6030.54
cosmology and God it is so

6027.659 --> 6033.98
yeah I mean I always liked that Mark

6030.54 --> 6033.98
Sergeant brings that up

6053.699 --> 6059.0599999999995
okay your blood can't flow properly

6056.46 --> 6059.06
upside down

6059.52 --> 6064.02
well

6061.08 --> 6066.12
it's just because all the veins are all

6064.02 --> 6067.320000000001
they're all little pressure valves

6066.12 --> 6069.679
everywhere

6067.32 --> 6072.84
and they all face a certain direction

6069.679 --> 6076.1990000000005
because of how the cycle is normally

6072.84 --> 6079.1990000000005
going so if you then go upside down it's

6076.199 --> 6081.9
all pressing the wrong ways

6079.199 --> 6084.599999999999
so it'll like cause the blood to

6081.9 --> 6086.4
unnaturally Heap up because it's not

6084.6 --> 6087.719
being pressed against in the right

6086.4 --> 6088.86
direction

6087.719 --> 6091.26
see

6088.86 --> 6094.219
that's why it doesn't work well when you

6091.26 --> 6094.219
sit upside down

6095.639 --> 6102.54
sport app commercial yeah I've seen that

6098.88 --> 6105.56
he's done that silly stuff slow-mo moon

6102.54 --> 6105.56
buggy I know

6127.58 --> 6132.3
right anyway I hope you guys are

6129.6 --> 6136.34
enjoying the show

6132.3 --> 6136.34
going for our 40 minutes

6141.119 --> 6147.5
I'm still trying to puzzle out what the

6144.719 --> 6147.5
title should be

6164.4 --> 6171.259999999999
no woodworking gummy bear I disagree

6168.12 --> 6171.26
[Music]

6171.6 --> 6176.6990000000005
no there's no overriding of the laws of

6175.619 --> 6180.92
nature

6176.699 --> 6180.919999999999
they're simply knowledge

6181.199 --> 6188.099999999999
knowledge of how to do yeah I mean you

6184.86 --> 6191.159
can literally take water and then use

6188.1 --> 6193.4400000000005
electricity technology that's available

6191.159 --> 6195.659
right now to like imprint a certain

6193.44 --> 6198.299999999999
frequency on it

6195.659 --> 6200.46
so that it can literally make you drunk

6198.3 --> 6203.1
as if it has alcohol in it even though

6200.46 --> 6205.619
it literally has no alcohol in it yet if

6203.1 --> 6209.159000000001
that's possible

6205.619 --> 6211.139
then why wouldn't water be able to be

6209.159 --> 6213.9
turned into wine

6211.139 --> 6218.04
as in you drink it and then you become

6213.9 --> 6222.54
drunk from as if you drunk wine like

6218.04 --> 6225.42
that no there is no laws of nature that

6222.54 --> 6226.8
are being overwritten they're simply a

6225.42 --> 6229.02
way through

6226.8 --> 6231.360000000001
that is what is there

6229.02 --> 6235.400000000001
that is what is provable

6231.36 --> 6235.4
there's no cheat code

6235.619 --> 6242.839999999999
there's no cheat code

6238.139 --> 6242.84
there's only understanding the code

6249.719 --> 6255.619
stopping the Sun in the sky

6251.82 --> 6255.619
yeah well it's a celestial

6256.86 --> 6261.839999999999
how the hell do I know what that could

6259.5 --> 6264.48
have been I don't even by the way really

6261.84 --> 6266.34
know the full context of that particular

6264.48 --> 6270.54
story in the Bible

6266.34 --> 6274.5
but as far as I know why couldn't it

6270.54 --> 6277.699
literally be that it was like

6274.5 --> 6281.28
a parent stopping of time what if he

6277.699 --> 6283.5599999999995
literally pulled every person

6281.28 --> 6286.259999999999
into the dark world like activated

6283.56 --> 6291.5
everybody's pineal gland simultaneously

6286.26 --> 6291.5
to literally create a stop in time

6291.6 --> 6296.52
so that everybody would snap in there

6293.94 --> 6300.36
and there would be like a day or three

6296.52 --> 6302.76
days in between that moment

6300.36 --> 6304.739
in which the sun would stand still and

6302.76 --> 6307.26
everybody would just

6304.739 --> 6310.0199999999995
roam around in that dream simulation

6307.26 --> 6312.54
world for three days

6310.02 --> 6315.9800000000005
why wouldn't it be that

6312.54 --> 6315.98
how the hell do you know

6336.6 --> 6338.780000000001
thank you

6349.4 --> 6354.54
suspension of time would violate the

6351.6 --> 6357.179
laws of nature well not if it's not

6354.54 --> 6359.76
actually time that is passing

6357.179 --> 6361.8
the Consciousness can be compressed to a

6359.76 --> 6363.54
level where you can experience vast

6361.8 --> 6366.7390000000005
amounts of time

6363.54 --> 6371.219
in technically a very short time I've

6366.739 --> 6375.36
literally experienced that yeah

6371.219 --> 6378.96
for an insanely long time

6375.36 --> 6381.5599999999995
all compacted in what was probably like

6378.96 --> 6381.56
one minute

6381.659 --> 6387.96
and when I came out of it I was a

6383.88 --> 6391.28
completely I felt like I just

6387.96 --> 6391.28
been to jail

6391.44 --> 6397.379999999999
like I was trapped in another world for

6394.139 --> 6400.56
a very [ __ ] long time yeah if that's

6397.38 --> 6401.96
possible then you I'll bet you it's

6400.56 --> 6406.080000000001
possible

6401.96 --> 6408.78
that God or whatever simply does click

6406.08 --> 6411.6
and every [ __ ] living thing in that

6408.78 --> 6414.119
second just go tune in to another

6411.6 --> 6416.780000000001
freaking Dimension yeah a dark World

6414.119 --> 6420.0599999999995
simulation Dimension and then

6416.78 --> 6422.4
experiences the world as it was exactly

6420.06 --> 6424.26
in that moment Frozen in time for three

6422.4 --> 6427.08
days

6424.26 --> 6428.76
where we would still have are we able to

6427.08 --> 6430.92
move like the things I would tap in

6428.76 --> 6432.900000000001
would be able to move maybe even animals

6430.92 --> 6434.6990000000005
could be part of a Dark World Collective

6432.9 --> 6436.199
Vision yeah

6434.699 --> 6440.0599999999995
yeah

6436.199 --> 6440.0599999999995
definitely think that's possible

6449.34 --> 6454.56
and I think it's a lot more logic than

6451.5 --> 6457.199
oh I'm gonna turn the sun still

6454.56 --> 6459.4800000000005
but I mean on the other hand I mean what

6457.199 --> 6461.219
the hell even is the celestial

6459.48 --> 6464.159
lights you know

6461.219 --> 6467.4
there's no physical objection to the sun

6464.159 --> 6470.4
being put still as in like if it happens

6467.4 --> 6472.739
like oh the sun's standing still oh well

6470.4 --> 6476.159
I don't give a [ __ ]

6472.739 --> 6478.739
cause it's just a hologram anyway but

6476.159 --> 6480.9
it'll mess up the the sky clock if that

6478.739 --> 6483.299999999999
would happen

6480.9 --> 6485.099999999999
ever considered that maybe those three

6483.3 --> 6486.78
days where the sun Stood Still or

6485.1 --> 6489.2390000000005
however long it was

6486.78 --> 6492.719
ever considered that he was that God was

6489.239 --> 6495.659
basically just like oh [ __ ] the time is

6492.719 --> 6499.8
not exactly right let me

6495.659 --> 6501.599999999999
change the time said it right so he kept

6499.8 --> 6505.5
the sun standing still for three days

6501.6 --> 6507.360000000001
and it's like ah now the clock's perfect

6505.5 --> 6509.34
I don't know I'm improvising at this

6507.36 --> 6512.46
point but I mean

6509.34 --> 6514.679
it's just a hologram anyway there's no

6512.46 --> 6516.96
physical implication that will be

6514.679 --> 6517.7390000000005
violated by the standing still of a

6516.96 --> 6519.3
clock

6517.739 --> 6520.86
in the sky

6519.3 --> 6521.9400000000005
because if nothing about that is

6520.86 --> 6524.4
physical

6521.94 --> 6526.5
so there's no physical laws that are

6524.4 --> 6528.839999999999
being violated by its standing still

6526.5 --> 6532.739
it's just that the sky clock would

6528.84 --> 6536.76
suddenly be different then because time

6532.739 --> 6539.099999999999
that is derived the time convention that

6536.76 --> 6542.84
is derived calendar convention from the

6539.1 --> 6542.84
celestials will have been altered

6547.86 --> 6552.36
right where there's nothing physical

6549.96 --> 6555.119
about the celestial lights including the

6552.36 --> 6556.739
Sun that would have to be violated in

6555.119 --> 6559.0199999999995
order to alter anything about them

6556.739 --> 6561.199
because they're not physical objects you

6559.02 --> 6561.1990000000005
see

6562.44 --> 6568.5199999999995
so not not a big deal

6565.86 --> 6568.5199999999995
really

6574.44 --> 6579.619
so yeah how many more examples of things

6577.619 --> 6582.96
oh well that

6579.619 --> 6585.0599999999995
the cheat code God just completely

6582.96 --> 6588.5
altered how everything worked just for

6585.06 --> 6588.5
that occasion oh really

6593.34 --> 6599.2390000000005
well what if it's just possible to do

6596.52 --> 6599.2390000000005
things like that

6600.659 --> 6606.48
and if you're close enough to God

6604.26 --> 6609.54
you're conscious enough if you have

6606.48 --> 6614.94
enough Ascension you see enough

6609.54 --> 6617.4
then you simply find out how you do that

6614.94 --> 6620.58
have you ever considered that

6617.4 --> 6624.0599999999995
no natural laws need to be violated you

6620.58 --> 6626.94
simply figure out how to do that

6624.06 --> 6629.52
starting by completely rearranging your

6626.94 --> 6631.678999999999
perspective on how things actually work

6629.52 --> 6634.080000000001
yeah and you leave out all the nonsense

6631.679 --> 6638.34
physicality assumption bias

6634.08 --> 6640.92
of the celestial bodies for starters

6638.34 --> 6643.32
and then suddenly you get a completely

6640.92 --> 6646.139
different perspective on how things

6643.32 --> 6648.78
could work and what really is natural

6646.139 --> 6651.6
law what things are absolutely a must be

6648.78 --> 6652.679
because of a physical element and what

6651.6 --> 6655.320000000001
things

6652.679 --> 6658.76
don't have to be absolutely because

6655.32 --> 6658.759999999999
there is no physical element

6660.659 --> 6665.78
yeah yeah well maybe God doesn't cheat

6667.56 --> 6671.820000000001
maybe it's the devil that actually

6669.719 --> 6673.139
cheats would work in gummy bear have you

6671.82 --> 6678.54
ever considered that

6673.139 --> 6678.54
like this foundational esoteric

6678.78 --> 6683.46
insight

6680.639 --> 6687.26
that maybe God doesn't need to cheat

6683.46 --> 6687.26
never heard of that one

6705.96 --> 6708.9800000000005
all right anyway

6726.36 --> 6731.599999999999
right now how am I gonna title this show

6751.09 --> 6754.119000000001
[Music]

6771.659 --> 6777.719
yeah let's

6774.3 --> 6780.06
let's not make it a goofy title

6777.719 --> 6781.7390000000005
let's make it a very over generalized

6780.06 --> 6784.4400000000005
title

6781.739 --> 6787.5599999999995
that addresses the whole thing of what

6784.44 --> 6789.599999999999
I'm I've been trying to do for a while

6787.56 --> 6794.119000000001
and that is a revolutionary New

6789.6 --> 6794.119000000001
Perspective on God Christ and the Bible

6795.6 --> 6800.34
as I said very

6798.179 --> 6803.4
over generalized

6800.34 --> 6804.42
as a title but appropriate would you not

6803.4 --> 6806.638999999999
say

6804.42 --> 6809.4
what do you guys think

6806.639 --> 6812.42
so the good title does it suck

6809.4 --> 6812.42
you tell me

6843.139 --> 6847.219
looks good yeah thanks Oz

6861.42 --> 6867.179
maybe some student will find this video

6864.42 --> 6870.06
Maybe

6867.179 --> 6872.58
maybe they will I mean I'd love to go

6870.06 --> 6876.02
into a discussion with

6872.58 --> 6876.0199999999995
such students

6878.52 --> 6882.38
as long as they're not gammas

6889.139 --> 6893.179
if you don't know how the algorithm

6890.88 --> 6897.02
works these days I don't know either

6893.179 --> 6897.02
I'm just trying stuff

6897.26 --> 6901.619000000001
the Revolutionary part seems a bit

6900.36 --> 6904.679
clickbaity

6901.619 --> 6907.139
yeah fair enough isn't that true though

6904.679 --> 6908.76
is it not a revolutionary New

6907.139 --> 6911.1
Perspective

6908.76 --> 6913.92
isn't it

6911.1 --> 6916.4400000000005
I think I've been putting down a pretty

6913.92 --> 6920.84
revolutionary New Perspective on God

6916.44 --> 6920.839999999999
Christ and the Bible for a few years now

6921.06 --> 6924.4400000000005
would you not agree

6926.46 --> 6931.32
it's just that I put it in a title now

6928.739 --> 6934.86
together like as if it were a book title

6931.32 --> 6937.44
right it's like if I write a book about

6934.86 --> 6938.94
my interpretation of Christ God and

6937.44 --> 6941.58
Bible

6938.94 --> 6944.178999999999
then I would probably call it something

6941.58 --> 6944.179
like this

6949.619 --> 6955.44
time will tell if it's revolutionary

6953.219 --> 6958.159
yeah

6955.44 --> 6958.159
it will

6970.32 --> 6976.199
because it is quite a revolution I mean

6972.9 --> 6978.179
we are like utterly rejecting all church

6976.199 --> 6980.638999999999
doctrine in that sense and literally

6978.179 --> 6983.6990000000005
said like I'm declared like it's

6980.639 --> 6986.9400000000005
literally Lucifer that's keeping Christ

6983.699 --> 6989.94
in a [ __ ] cage and claiming they're

6986.94 --> 6991.379999999999
God yeah that's what this freaking

6989.94 --> 6994.08
Church is

6991.38 --> 6997.1990000000005
it's Lucifer

6994.08 --> 6999.619
the church is Lucifer that captured

6997.199 --> 6999.619
Christ

7001.04 --> 7006.5
holding it hostage

7004.699 --> 7008.9
okay

7006.5 --> 7012.02
I think that's quite the Revolutionary

7008.9 --> 7013.36
perspective I don't even think that

7012.02 --> 7016.400000000001
like

7013.36 --> 7019.099999999999
protestantism got that far in their

7016.4 --> 7021.679
views on it since they literally copied

7019.1 --> 7024.5
most of the doctrines

7021.679 --> 7026.6
for their own it was more about like we

7024.5 --> 7029.659
don't want you to have this Theocratic

7026.6 --> 7031.88
power oh that's so cute you'll take like

7029.659 --> 7034.339999999999
all the things that are absolutely wrong

7031.88 --> 7037.88
about it though and make it your own

7034.34 --> 7039.1990000000005
right is it just copy Lucifer's book

7037.88 --> 7040.6990000000005
there

7039.199 --> 7043.699
sure

7040.699 --> 7047.44
yeah I'm a little bit more revolutionary

7043.699 --> 7052.0599999999995
than that and I'm like saying it's all

7047.44 --> 7052.0599999999995
luciferarian like the whole thing

7053.36 --> 7057.159
the entire architecture of it

7057.739 --> 7062.36
it's there to [ __ ] with the mind and to

7059.96 --> 7066.199
corrupt it and to gather their corrupted

7062.36 --> 7068.659
and control it and tame the good willing

7066.199 --> 7069.919999999999
and like sacrifice them so they can feel

7068.659 --> 7072.259999999999
like Christ

7069.92 --> 7073.9400000000005
right give them something like oh you're

7072.26 --> 7076.280000000001
a really good person so like Christ

7073.94 --> 7078.5
you're gonna die now and then

7076.28 --> 7080.48
everybody's gonna feel good about that

7078.5 --> 7083.599
or something

7080.48 --> 7085.9
it's just all [ __ ] all [ __ ] with

7083.599 --> 7085.900000000001
people

7090.92 --> 7097.4800000000005
it is a lot paganism in Disguise

7093.619 --> 7097.48
arguably yeah sure

7097.76 --> 7102.7390000000005
but I mean technically in my opinion

7100.88 --> 7105.02
there's not even anything wrong with

7102.739 --> 7107.598999999999
freaking paganism

7105.02 --> 7110.119000000001
okay I have nothing against it

7107.599 --> 7113.42
except if they're going to insist oh

7110.119 --> 7117.199
yeah but we really do have to sacrifice

7113.42 --> 7120.26
some animal or a person to this supposed

7117.199 --> 7122.598999999999
deity yeah that's when it goes way over

7120.26 --> 7123.679
out of that's simply where the line is

7122.599 --> 7125.599
dropped

7123.679 --> 7128.38
right

7125.599 --> 7128.38
but

7129.8 --> 7136.179
yeah same goes for this Christianity

7133.699 --> 7136.178999999999
itself

7136.82 --> 7141.259999999999
I mean isn't the line very much drawn

7139.699 --> 7144.379999999999
when

7141.26 --> 7147.08
when people literally fight Crusades

7144.38 --> 7148.9400000000005
that use a cross they paint on their

7147.08 --> 7152.119
Shields

7148.94 --> 7154.759999999999
while they literally Slaughter

7152.119 --> 7157.699
like entire Villages women and children

7154.76 --> 7161.92
you think that might be a little bit too

7157.699 --> 7161.919999999999
far too huh you think

7173.719 --> 7178.58
so

7176.3 --> 7180.92
I don't think paganism is the problem I

7178.58 --> 7183.82
think that evil

7180.92 --> 7183.82
is the problem

7184.699 --> 7190.638999999999
and I think that Christianity has

7187.219 --> 7193.04
basically been captured by Lucifer so

7190.639 --> 7194.599
Lucifer rules out for Christianity do

7193.04 --> 7197.36
the people think they're doing the right

7194.599 --> 7200.4800000000005
thing but they've been given Doctrine

7197.36 --> 7202.5199999999995
that's there to deceive them

7200.48 --> 7204.5599999999995
you think they're following Christ but

7202.52 --> 7207.7390000000005
they're they're following Lucifer that's

7204.56 --> 7210.860000000001
manipulated it all only Christ's words

7207.739 --> 7214.339999999999
remain pure but how people are taught to

7210.86 --> 7216.5599999999995
think about Christ's words

7214.34 --> 7219.139
are different that's where Lucifer's

7216.56 --> 7221.119000000001
input comes in that's where hermeto

7219.139 --> 7223.2390000000005
weddings come in

7221.119 --> 7225.92
so that you can

7223.239 --> 7230.0599999999995
bypass logic

7225.92 --> 7234.5
and just interpret it the way the people

7230.06 --> 7238.599
in power want you to interpret it

7234.5 --> 7238.599
yeah that's what that is

7244.82 --> 7249.199
all right see you later see you later

7246.679 --> 7252.639
with working anywhere thanks for popping

7249.199 --> 7252.638999999999
by having this discussion

7261.44 --> 7266.138999999999
Jesus came to bring the sword

7270.38 --> 7273.34
I agree

7276.679 --> 7281.3
I mean what they say even about Jesus is

7279.56 --> 7283.639
that he was supposedly the Prince of

7281.3 --> 7285.7390000000005
Peace I don't believe it

7283.639 --> 7287.719
I don't believe it for a second he was

7285.739 --> 7292.119
not

7287.719 --> 7292.119
he was not a prince of peace at all

7292.34 --> 7297.619000000001
but he was not a warmonger as in a

7296.239 --> 7300.44
conqueror

7297.619 --> 7303.94
but he definitely recognized that you

7300.44 --> 7310.0599999999995
have to be vicious and direct

7303.94 --> 7310.0599999999995
to actually create order and stability

7313.159 --> 7319.159
it's like if you're just direct

7316.78 --> 7324.88
and strict

7319.159 --> 7324.879999999999
then you create peace through that order

7328.76 --> 7335.0
it requires a sword to keep order in

7332.78 --> 7337.159
that sense back then right when sword

7335.0 --> 7340.48
was the the power

7337.159 --> 7340.48
the physical power

7341.199 --> 7345.379999999999
and the symbol for that

7343.76 --> 7347.84
so yeah

7345.38 --> 7350.38
you could say that Jesus came to bring

7347.84 --> 7350.38
the sword

7366.739 --> 7371.919999999999
you were mad when he knocked over the

7368.84 --> 7371.92
standards what

7374.719 --> 7379.46
it dude just

7377.06 --> 7383.360000000001
if it's all misspelling just delete it

7379.46 --> 7386.54
or copy it then delete it then paste it

7383.36 --> 7389.44
then correct it then enter I mean it's

7386.54 --> 7389.44
not that difficult

7390.76 --> 7394.659000000001
but fine I get it

7397.58 --> 7403.159
I don't see why you were so mad though

7399.739 --> 7405.5199999999995
when Jesus like knocked over the stands

7403.159 --> 7405.5199999999995
and such

7407.84 --> 7411.7390000000005
you do realize why he was doing that

7409.88 --> 7413.84
right he was doing that because he

7411.739 --> 7416.0599999999995
didn't want the church to be a place

7413.84 --> 7418.96
where people were only thinking about

7416.06 --> 7418.96
business again

7419.36 --> 7423.38
that's a like a holy place it's not a

7421.94 --> 7427.159
place where you should be thinking about

7423.38 --> 7429.28
money that was really the fundamental of

7427.159 --> 7429.28
it

7430.639 --> 7436.400000000001
yeah it's like how dare you replace the

7433.76 --> 7439.099
love of God with the love of money in

7436.4 --> 7441.699
this holy place that's why he went

7439.099 --> 7441.6990000000005
berserk

7444.8 --> 7450.1990000000005
that's missed but find Supreme knowing

7447.56 --> 7452.42
if it's that terribly wrong then

7450.199 --> 7454.96
freaking deleted and rewrite it

7452.42 --> 7454.96
correctly

7464.06 --> 7468.400000000001
I didn't told Peter to go buy a sword

7466.099 --> 7468.400000000001
yeah

7471.619 --> 7476.119
right

7472.82 --> 7478.58
because peace only comes when order is

7476.119 --> 7480.92
enforced

7478.58 --> 7482.719
peace doesn't come naturally when

7480.92 --> 7486.46
there's chaos and everybody can just do

7482.719 --> 7486.46
whatever they feel like in the moment

7487.219 --> 7492.7390000000005
has to be ordered it has to be force

7489.619 --> 7495.219
that will make people stop behaving like

7492.739 --> 7495.218999999999
demons

7496.599 --> 7502.219
and back then the way to achieve that

7499.46 --> 7505.3
order would be through a sword it was

7502.219 --> 7505.3
the weapon of choice

7520.639 --> 7524.3
you said a few days ago you don't need

7522.619 --> 7526.759999999999
to delete everything hey you don't need

7524.3 --> 7529.34
to delete it every freaking time

7526.76 --> 7533.320000000001
but I mean if you have a sentence that's

7529.34 --> 7535.28
just like really misinterpreted

7533.32 --> 7537.739
misinterpretable

7535.28 --> 7541.28
then yeah

7537.739 --> 7543.919999999999
then just redo it

7541.28 --> 7545.0199999999995
delete copy the sentence delete the

7543.92 --> 7549.02
sentence

7545.02 --> 7551.659000000001
reconstruct the sentence look at it read

7549.02 --> 7553.280000000001
it out loud make sure that it's actually

7551.659 --> 7555.32
correct

7553.28 --> 7557.9
and then when you're absolutely certain

7555.32 --> 7559.82
you type enter

7557.9 --> 7562.36
yeah it doesn't matter if it took you

7559.82 --> 7562.36
five minutes

7565.639 --> 7570.34
that's how I do it

7568.28 --> 7573.86
you're gonna type something do it well

7570.34 --> 7576.02
never rush it never

7573.86 --> 7578.86
it's never good when you rush out

7576.02 --> 7578.860000000001
something like that

7581.9 --> 7587.179
unless if it's a joke right because then

7584.78 --> 7588.739
timing matters but I mean if it's a joke

7587.179 --> 7590.54
and timing matters then it doesn't

7588.739 --> 7592.82
really matter that you said it perfectly

7590.54 --> 7594.26
correctly anyway because it's just a

7592.82 --> 7596.86
joke so

7594.26 --> 7596.860000000001
anyway

7616.219 --> 7620.36
right but I mean Supreme knowing don't

7618.5 --> 7622.4
worry about it it's just like it's

7620.36 --> 7625.339999999999
annoying when you type and then delete

7622.4 --> 7628.598999999999
every sentence again

7625.34 --> 7632.06
like if you have more message removed

7628.599 --> 7634.099
behind your name on my chat screen then

7632.06 --> 7636.02
you have actual sentences that's when

7634.099 --> 7638.3
you get on my nerves

7636.02 --> 7640.46
so don't freaking delete every sentence

7638.3 --> 7643.6990000000005
because you had one thing wrong about it

7640.46 --> 7647.84
but if something is really a mess

7643.699 --> 7651.5599999999995
then you should delete it and rewrite it

7647.84 --> 7652.6990000000005
correctly I do that too

7651.56 --> 7655.580000000001
just

7652.699 --> 7658.4
don't have more deleted or retracted

7655.58 --> 7661.34
messages behind your name then you have

7658.4 --> 7663.5
actual sentences okay

7661.34 --> 7666.08
that's the main concern

7663.5 --> 7667.82
because it looks really it starts it

7666.08 --> 7669.86
makes you look like a troll because

7667.82 --> 7671.96
there's trolls that do that too they

7669.86 --> 7674.0
they say stupid gamma things and then

7671.96 --> 7676.82
they retract it because

7674.0 --> 7678.739
then you can't read it it's really

7676.82 --> 7680.599
annoying

7678.739 --> 7683.44
unless you like kick them out and then

7680.599 --> 7683.4400000000005
you can read it anyway

7692.36 --> 7700.119
right anyway anybody here still there

7696.739 --> 7700.119
past the two hour mark

7714.739 --> 7721.879999999999
flutter Sage Oz zap tapi

7719.42 --> 7724.3
you got anything woodworking gummy bear

7721.88 --> 7724.3
is gone

7732.139 --> 7738.56
do you know what I feel about

7735.619 --> 7739.759999999999
over four minutes of silence in the chat

7738.56 --> 7742.04
right

7739.76 --> 7743.4800000000005
after you've all been typing all kinds

7742.04 --> 7745.94
of stuff and then suddenly it got

7743.48 --> 7748.459999999999
silenced for a long time I don't like

7745.94 --> 7753.46
that when that happens

7748.46 --> 7753.46
don't do that thank you very much

7754.699 --> 7758.98
put your sword back in its place

7761.48 --> 7766.218999999999
yes

7764.0 --> 7770.3
that is true

7766.219 --> 7773.3
I'll live by the sword who draw the

7770.3 --> 7775.76
sword will die by yeah it's like live by

7773.3 --> 7777.619000000001
the sword die by the sword that's

7775.76 --> 7782.06
that's like the more

7777.619 --> 7784.639
it's a rephrased version of it

7782.06 --> 7787.219
but it is it's logical it's like if

7784.639 --> 7789.7390000000005
you're a police officer it's very likely

7787.219 --> 7791.84
that you'll

7789.739 --> 7793.459999999999
like in the United States then it's more

7791.84 --> 7795.139
likely that you'll get shot right

7793.46 --> 7797.06
because you're using a gun if you're

7795.139 --> 7800.1990000000005
gonna use a gun then there's a bigger

7797.06 --> 7800.1990000000005
likelihood you'll get shot

7800.9 --> 7805.699
it technically that is true

7803.48 --> 7806.48
so yeah the same goes for a sword if you

7805.699 --> 7809.78
start

7806.48 --> 7812.239
like I'm The Swordsman

7809.78 --> 7816.219
then people are gonna probably attack

7812.239 --> 7816.218999999999
you because you have a sword

7829.219 --> 7837.28
was this just for that situation in that

7832.88 --> 7837.28
time no I'd say it's Universal

7837.5 --> 7845.0
it's a fractal thing it's like yeah if

7840.98 --> 7848.239
you if you're gonna be using a sword

7845.0 --> 7850.099
then that greatly increases the chances

7848.239 --> 7853.04
that a sword is going to be used against

7850.099 --> 7855.46
you that's just a fact

7853.04 --> 7855.46
right

7856.639 --> 7864.099
so it's not just applicable to that

7859.28 --> 7864.099
situation it is universal it is fractal

7864.28 --> 7868.46
what's the connection to medicine and

7866.84 --> 7869.659000000001
Hermes what what does that have to do

7868.46 --> 7873.4
with it

7869.659 --> 7873.4
I don't get it Richard G

7879.44 --> 7882.638999999999
I don't see it

7889.239 --> 7894.739
except that maybe hermit well Hermes is

7893.659 --> 7897.339999999999
like

7894.739 --> 7897.339999999999
they

7897.5 --> 7901.78
Pantheon it got for a lot of things

7909.08 --> 7917.139
is arguably one of the most influential

7912.219 --> 7917.139
Greek gods of all time

7926.78 --> 7929.8
more than it

7932.54 --> 7936.699
so what's the point of ring a sword well

7939.8 --> 7944.139
is because then you can use it

7945.56 --> 7950.119000000001
yeah it'll still bring power it's just

7947.78 --> 7952.28
that you can have power with the sword

7950.119 --> 7955.219
but then it's more likely that power

7952.28 --> 7957.679
will also be used against you

7955.219 --> 7960.5
that's just how it works if nobody

7957.679 --> 7963.1990000000005
brings a sword then somebody else might

7960.5 --> 7965.239
bring a sword that does not like any of

7963.199 --> 7967.719
you and it will simply just kill you or

7965.239 --> 7970.28
something right so

7967.719 --> 7973.78
I don't see what's the problem here

7970.28 --> 7973.78
Supreme knowing

7984.02 --> 7989.92
that's the stuff for Hermes symbol yeah

7987.02 --> 7989.92
okay but that's

7999.079 --> 8005.619
I mean technically like Hermes is also

8002.38 --> 8007.84
the god of chemistry

8005.619 --> 8011.759999999999
and Alchemy

8007.84 --> 8011.76
and like almost everything

8013.119 --> 8020.219
yes God of medicine like the pantheonic

8017.5 --> 8020.219
god of Medicine

8020.5 --> 8023.699
for Michaela

8028.06 --> 8031.06
Logistics

8032.139 --> 8037.56
business dude the Hermes is like

8038.56 --> 8042.34
a lot

8040.119 --> 8044.38
if you look at the pantheon and you look

8042.34 --> 8048.34
at what Hermes can do it's like okay

8044.38 --> 8051.639
modern society is pretty much 95 Hermes

8048.34 --> 8053.679
I'm not even joking I mean it literally

8051.639 --> 8056.38
is

8053.679 --> 8059.02
the hermification

8056.38 --> 8062.139
of the modern era is pretty astounding

8059.02 --> 8065.159000000001
how much influence Hermes has gotten is

8062.139 --> 8065.159000000001
pretty astounding

8075.82 --> 8080.199
it's like and it's like money too it's

8078.76 --> 8083.1990000000005
like money

8080.199 --> 8085.0199999999995
chemistry

8083.199 --> 8088.5
for Makia

8085.02 --> 8088.5
Logistics it's

8089.32 --> 8096.94
like what the frick isn't Hermes the

8092.739 --> 8096.94
pantheonic god of seriously

8097.599 --> 8103.619000000001
what isn't he a pantheonic god of

8100.719 --> 8103.619
think about it

8111.159 --> 8114.119
but uh

8119.44 --> 8125.0199999999995
one thing is certain though

8122.139 --> 8130.3
Hermes is not

8125.02 --> 8133.659000000001
a pantheonic God that attunes to Christ

8130.3 --> 8136.84
that is one thing that is certain

8133.659 --> 8139.719
and that's also why luciferians like to

8136.84 --> 8141.639
reference him why

8139.719 --> 8144.579
why do they reference herpes well

8141.639 --> 8146.679
because Hermes is the most capable you

8144.579 --> 8148.239
like everything he does is exactly

8146.679 --> 8150.28
Within

8148.239 --> 8153.839999999999
reach

8150.28 --> 8153.84
of luciferianism

8178.48 --> 8183.699
did Jesus actually teach about turning

8181.179 --> 8186.96
the other cheek

8183.699 --> 8186.96
let's use the power

8187.119 --> 8193.42
yeah but I mean it depends I don't know

8190.239 --> 8195.58
exactly I'd need to like hear the fine

8193.42 --> 8196.960000000001
details of that situation where he

8195.58 --> 8200.76
taught that

8196.96 --> 8205.259999999998
it could be a fake but on the other hand

8200.76 --> 8205.26
turning the cheek is really about

8205.3 --> 8212.08
not immediately like brutalize somebody

8208.84 --> 8214.54
just because they disagree with you when

8212.08 --> 8215.859
they could be very important allies in

8214.54 --> 8218.559000000001
the future

8215.859 --> 8220.359
yeah I think that is really what the

8218.559 --> 8223.539999999999
turning the cheek is about it's not

8220.359 --> 8224.62
about being a [ __ ] taking a beating it's

8223.54 --> 8226.240000000002
about

8224.62 --> 8228.34
don't

8226.24 --> 8231.76
try to like

8228.34 --> 8233.559
finish somebody off because they oppose

8231.76 --> 8235.359
you

8233.559 --> 8237.639
it's like sometimes you go they

8235.359 --> 8239.979000000001
Somebody's gotta like be able to like

8237.639 --> 8242.979
misbehave and you don't just immediately

8239.979 --> 8244.779999999999
execute them or something because they

8242.979 --> 8247.479
might be very

8244.78 --> 8249.880000000001
capable you might have a path together

8247.479 --> 8253.179
where you're like going back and forth

8249.88 --> 8255.46
poking each other boxing a bit and then

8253.179 --> 8257.439
eventually turn into really reliable

8255.46 --> 8260.559
allies right

8257.439 --> 8264.58
so there's a very pragmatic site

8260.559 --> 8267.84
side to turning the cheek if you think

8264.58 --> 8267.84
very carefully about it

8268.719 --> 8272.139
yeah

8269.92 --> 8275.74
people that you think are your enemies

8272.139 --> 8276.82
might very well be your allies in the

8275.74 --> 8279.519
future

8276.82 --> 8282.219
just as some people that you think will

8279.519 --> 8284.800000000001
be your friends forever may turn into

8282.219 --> 8288.039999999999
your enemies in the future

8284.8 --> 8290.699999999999
and that's just how it is

8288.04 --> 8290.7
right

8298.899 --> 8304.858999999999
turning the other cheek seems very hard

8301.12 --> 8304.859
for Bible literalism yes yes

8305.679 --> 8311.92
but they can barely keep any logical

8309.28 --> 8314.5
consistencies within their hermetical or

8311.92 --> 8316.479
monoetical interpretations

8314.5 --> 8318.84
so yeah of course it's gonna be very

8316.479 --> 8318.84
tough

8331.359 --> 8335.26
that's right

8332.58 --> 8337.24
good to see you by the way but that is

8335.26 --> 8339.219000000001
exactly it it's all about the balance

8337.24 --> 8341.38
it's like when are you gonna turn the

8339.219 --> 8343.0
cheek and when are you gonna flip that

8341.38 --> 8345.339999999998
table

8343.0 --> 8347.08
that's a very good point

8345.34 --> 8350.380000000001
it's like

8347.08 --> 8353.2
it also like you can't really give a

8350.38 --> 8355.719
perfect instruction manual for this you

8353.2 --> 8358.0
see it's something you have to balance

8355.719 --> 8361.419999999998
out in that moment

8358.0 --> 8364.179
it's like you can't have a perfect

8361.42 --> 8366.7
instruction manual on exactly when to

8364.179 --> 8370.479
turn the cheek and when to flip the

8366.7 --> 8373.359
table because it's a fine balance you

8370.479 --> 8375.34
have to feel it out sometimes you can

8373.359 --> 8377.019
turn your cheek and it can turn out to

8375.34 --> 8378.82
be a complete waste and you just look

8377.019 --> 8380.08
stupid and they're not becoming your

8378.82 --> 8382.119999999999
friends

8380.08 --> 8386.439
and other times you might flip a table

8382.12 --> 8389.439
and then completely [ __ ] somebody up

8386.439 --> 8391.18
when they really were only wanting to do

8389.439 --> 8393.399
the right thing and now you've created

8391.18 --> 8395.439
an enemy where you where they you could

8393.399 --> 8398.26
have handled it another way right it's

8395.439 --> 8401.28
all about feeling it out

8398.26 --> 8401.28
and choosing

8406.54 --> 8409.62
choose carefully

8413.17 --> 8416.26
[Music]

8424.479 --> 8428.92
right so anyway I think I'm gonna move

8427.24 --> 8431.26
towards running out the show I've been

8428.92 --> 8433.66
going over two hours

8431.26 --> 8437.939
20 minutes

8433.66 --> 8437.939
I'm really looking forward to some lunch

8441.22 --> 8445.619999999999
but it's been a very interesting show

8442.899 --> 8445.619999999999
today I thought

8446.92 --> 8454.02
doing an actual full-on Bible oriented

8451.06 --> 8454.019999999999
show on a Sunday

8454.42 --> 8459.16
usually that doesn't work out but this

8456.64 --> 8461.08
time it it completely worked out and it

8459.16 --> 8462.939
happened all naturally

8461.08 --> 8464.2
it's just like hey Supreme knowing I

8462.939 --> 8466.12
noticed

8464.2 --> 8468.1
you're getting timed out

8466.12 --> 8470.5
that's literally where it started and

8468.1 --> 8471.76
all of this entire show rolled out of

8470.5 --> 8475.12
that one moment

8471.76 --> 8477.28
isn't that interesting how that works

8475.12 --> 8480.42
what you having for lunch uh yeah

8477.28 --> 8480.42
nothing special I'm just

8481.26 --> 8486.1
sourdough bread

8483.7 --> 8488.140000000001
with baked eggs

8486.1 --> 8490.960000000001
and some mayonnaise

8488.14 --> 8492.88
I mean it's a great as a lunch

8490.96 --> 8494.14
and then much later I'm gonna have like

8492.88 --> 8498.46
the standard

8494.14 --> 8502.358999999999
again of mashed potatoes with red beets

8498.46 --> 8504.699999999999
and a beef sausage with a lot of butter

8502.359 --> 8506.439
based gravy

8504.7 --> 8509.560000000001
so I'm looking forward to that already

8506.439 --> 8513.0
and I still have to get lunch right so

8509.56 --> 8513.0
yeah glad you all enjoyed the show

8513.58 --> 8518.62
the only Bible show with plenty of

8515.8 --> 8522.84
profanity well I wasn't that bad come on

8518.62 --> 8522.84
I I barely even used the f word

8523.6 --> 8530.800000000001
was not that much profanity was it

8527.14 --> 8534.099999999999
no pizza no no no no I'm I'm like

8530.8 --> 8536.74
cutting down on the amount of pizzas

8534.1 --> 8540.0
the pizzas were I mean don't

8536.74 --> 8542.5
don't get me wrong the pieces were great

8540.0 --> 8544.96
especially like during spring and summer

8542.5 --> 8547.78
I mean it was very enjoyable

8544.96 --> 8552.0
but I mean I'm just there's other types

8547.78 --> 8552.0
of foods that are now calling out to me

8552.28 --> 8560.76
more gravy and mashed potato type meals

8556.96 --> 8560.759999999998
are calling out to be right now

8561.88 --> 8565.839999999998
right besides I've been eating a lot

8563.8 --> 8568.56
less pizzas anyway since I completely

8565.84 --> 8568.56
