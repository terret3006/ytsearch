81.009 --> 91.99
that again whatever yeah today the

87.25 --> 95.56
weather is quite beautiful again but

91.99 --> 100.179
there's also a bit of a haze because

95.56 --> 103.509
yesterday after the show like they were

100.179 --> 107.25
Kemp trailing so bad that yeah I was

103.509 --> 109.75
kind of pissed off and started basically

107.25 --> 111.28
pointing it out to everyone like hey

109.75 --> 115.11
look at that blue sky look at that

111.28 --> 118.41
stripe being sprayed that massive white

115.11 --> 120.849
thing that's being sprayed right then

118.41 --> 124.149
just pointing it out look look at that

120.849 --> 126.19
look at that just pointing up just that

124.149 --> 128.64
Hey look at that do you see that do you

126.19 --> 128.64
see that

131.87 --> 138.57
because that was just yeah extraordinary

135.54 --> 140.51999999999998
you know it was just this great blue sky

138.57 --> 145.56
and there were just these massive

140.52 --> 146.73000000000002
chemtrails being trouble so blatantly in

145.56 --> 148.83
everyone's face

146.73 --> 150.72
up there but everybody's just walking

148.83 --> 151.79000000000002
around yesterday and really paying

150.72 --> 154.34
attention

151.79 --> 158.31
today's a lot warmer though by the way

154.34 --> 160.44
and I haven't really been out yet or

158.31 --> 165.14000000000001
well I have but I don't know it was just

160.44 --> 165.14
very warm feels like summer

174.55 --> 178.62
that's not gonna work here

178.89 --> 182.01
[Music]

195.04 --> 197.819
hmm

202.04 --> 209.17999999999998
wait right I'm gonna do that I thought

205.97 --> 211.909
you were actual but just looked at your

209.18 --> 214.90900000000002
channel second thought maybe this guy is

211.909 --> 217.489
just he just happens to be called Alex

214.909 --> 222.739
Jones as well you know can blame for

217.489 --> 225.709
having the name sorry about that but

222.739 --> 231.26
we'll see anyway I'm gonna look through

225.709 --> 236.39000000000001
chat yeah by the way if I seem a little

231.26 --> 239.569
slow it is like really warm so it's not

236.39 --> 244.22
shirtless warm yet but if this gets any

239.569 --> 246.7
any heater hotter then maybe anyway dank

244.22 --> 246.7
was first

253.15 --> 256.81
all right yeah he's yeah Alex Jones

255.37 --> 264.93
actually seems to be a real person

256.81 --> 268.36
asking normal questions yeah yeah look

264.93 --> 271.479
look if your real name is Jones then

268.36 --> 273.1
yeah by all means use that of course you

271.479 --> 276.09999999999997
know if it is your real name then it's

273.1 --> 279.90000000000003
almost yeah you should use it like that

276.1 --> 283.63
maybe to be a slightly trollish even but

279.9 --> 286.09
if it's not then please indeed do change

283.63 --> 288.82
it because I get certain types of trolls

286.09 --> 292.09
that typically do these kind of tricks

288.82 --> 295.15
where they just use some kind of more

292.09 --> 297.15999999999997
famous person person's name and then

295.15 --> 300.21999999999997
start to troll me with that so that's

297.16 --> 300.90000000000003
why I kind of reflex banned you sorry

300.22 --> 307.12
about that

300.9 --> 314.169
anyway Alex Jones uber Mukul Jeffrey

307.12 --> 317.8
bill capo of them did leave it all your

314.169 --> 322.83
messages sorry about that

317.8 --> 328.05
I'll see if I can read them glass jaw

322.83 --> 328.05
Steve George Sanford

331.18 --> 340.59000000000003
Guns of Navarone II RMP okay read em

342.45 --> 347.68
right now it's okay dude sorry about

346.69 --> 350.29
yeah

347.68 --> 353.59000000000003
banning you outright you said a lot of

350.29 --> 357.51000000000005
things let me check you had some

353.59 --> 357.51
questions about my background picture

359.97 --> 366.61
interesting model huh Wow

362.32 --> 369.43
you actually called it a model dude I I

366.61 --> 374.11
almost actually banned any somebody that

369.43 --> 378.88
actually had interests that interest in

374.11 --> 381.15000000000003
my model that would have been pretty

378.88 --> 381.15
stupid

382.35 --> 390.87
no that's right you yeah this guy gets

386.35 --> 390.87
it it's a circle

393.75 --> 405.92
how do you concede it's a circle okay

414.12 --> 424.41
anyway yeah the background picture you

416.61 --> 426.65000000000003
see I used that alright what was his

424.41 --> 426.65000000000003
name again

430.12 --> 436.66
this guy was rich in the Neffe core but

435.01 --> 442.71999999999997
he was kind of what turned out to be a

436.66 --> 447.699
Glover yeah anyway he made it with his

442.72 --> 449.26000000000005
3d program and yeah he already was

447.699 --> 451.81
fooling around with that and I asked him

449.26 --> 455.83
like hey could you make a nice snap shot

451.81 --> 460.75
with this with the star glow like

455.83 --> 463.27
basically on the background and yeah as

460.75 --> 467.05
a sphere around the center point of the

463.27 --> 468.34
image and then it as a rectangle looking

467.05 --> 471.7
over it from the south

468.34 --> 473.28999999999996
yeah and he made that back in the day

471.7 --> 478.75
when I was still having a flat earth

473.29 --> 480.16
talk show and yeah that is a yeah it's

478.75 --> 483.16
the best I could do

480.16 --> 487.03000000000003
concerning trying to depict in some

483.16 --> 493.6
visual 2d way they had the model of the

487.03 --> 497.46999999999997
rectangular looping realm that's right

493.6 --> 501.78900000000004
that's right Alex Jones because the the

497.47 --> 505.57000000000005
globe of the heavens is yeah in my

501.789 --> 508.84
conception in my model is a well a

505.57 --> 512.05
sphere that surrounds the observer and

508.84 --> 514.9
all of those lights you see at the edge

512.05 --> 519.9689999999999
of vision in a very specific correlation

514.9 --> 522.7289999999999
to your position and yet that is part of

519.969 --> 525.25
the design like I pretty much say all

522.729 --> 527.74
the heavenly bodies are holographic and

525.25 --> 530.26
they the visuals of it represent

527.74 --> 533.55
themselves as a damaged fear because you

530.26 --> 536.5
never see him under that you basically

533.55 --> 539.92
they represent themselves as a demo

536.5 --> 544.39
spare of lights surrounding you and a

539.92 --> 547.5
yeah it is at a certain distance an

544.39 --> 547.5
apparent distance

551.68 --> 558.3399999999999
[Music]

554.91 --> 562.0899999999999
because yeah as soon as like the whole

558.34 --> 566.2
picture envelops itself in that then my

562.09 --> 569.94
sphere or in the sphere of the globe of

566.2 --> 572.74
the heavens then that's not very clear

569.94 --> 574.69
that it's actually at a apparent

572.74 --> 576.1
distance from the observer because yeah

574.69 --> 579.33
most observers are going to be on the

576.1 --> 581.47
surface of the earth so that's what the

579.33 --> 583.4200000000001
globe of the heavens in the picture is

581.47 --> 586.5400000000001
centered around technically but it's

583.42 --> 588.43
also behind things because that is what

586.54 --> 593.7099999999999
it is it is can be obstructed by

588.43 --> 596.4399999999999
anything physical and it is just like an

593.71 --> 600.4000000000001
apparent backdrop in the form of a

596.44 --> 601.87
sphere of Lights and that includes the

600.4 --> 605.9499999999999
Sun in the moon and all that by the way

601.87 --> 608.52
weirdly enough it makes it a little bit

605.95 --> 608.5200000000001
more complicated

609.78 --> 612.8199999999999
[Music]

616.54 --> 623.569
yes I know

618.23 --> 626.3000000000001
Guns of Navarone II I don't know

623.569 --> 628.1899999999999
George Sanford I don't know look I don't

626.3 --> 630.62
even want to go too much in there I'm

628.19 --> 633.8290000000001
just I got kind of stressed out I have

630.62 --> 635.649
been for a few days because the

633.829 --> 639.199
Netherlands has been through this [ __ ]

635.649 --> 644.149
they did do like 5g testing here I

639.199 --> 648.019
remember that and there was a lot of

644.149 --> 650.75
fight against it I knew some of the

648.019 --> 654.079
people that were trying to do that and

650.75 --> 656.48
we had yeah we managed to kind of keep

654.079 --> 659.3889999999999
it out of becoming a universal standard

656.48 --> 661.639
here but there's still suspicion that

659.389 --> 665.509
here and there it is has been kind of

661.639 --> 668.389
covertly sneaked in like like completely

665.509 --> 670.79
invisible so yeah that can be slightly

668.389 --> 673.67
paranoid no you're inducing but at the

670.79 --> 677.75
same time people that have been onto

673.67 --> 679.49
this radiological issue from cell phone

677.75 --> 681.199
towers and all that and they have been

679.49 --> 685.04
for like 30 years since it pretty much

681.199 --> 688.37
started they have now very sensible

685.04 --> 690.199
sensitive equipment to just sense out

688.37 --> 694.73
where this type of activity is going in

690.199 --> 698.029
order to yeah see what is installed

694.73 --> 703.4300000000001
whether it is like physically visible or

698.029 --> 705.019
not so but yeah it's now it I just feel

703.43 --> 706.519
like a lot of the rest of the world is

705.019 --> 710.72
being subjected to it and especially

706.519 --> 714.35
England and so it kind of brought back

710.72 --> 717.649
old trauma because I was extremely upset

714.35 --> 722.1990000000001
when that [ __ ] was going down here in

717.649 --> 726.47
the Netherlands like I felt it it's bad

722.199 --> 730.6099999999999
literally hurts my bones like there were

726.47 --> 733.7900000000001
places where where they yeah that thing

730.61 --> 738.88
was yeah there

733.79 --> 741.89
and even before I would see such a thing

738.88 --> 746.93
standing out somewhere I would just feel

741.89 --> 750.17
it because the yeah it was if I remember

746.93 --> 753.3499999999999
correctly in Germany they they did that

750.17 --> 755.8399999999999
in Leipzig where there was the wave

753.35 --> 758.9300000000001
gothic - - where I went to like on a

755.84 --> 761.0600000000001
yearly basis in spring with my with my

758.93 --> 764.6899999999999
next girlfriend and there were these

761.06 --> 766.4599999999999
things there pretty sure of it and I

764.69 --> 773.12
would feel it and Eve complained to my

766.46 --> 776.36
girlfriend about it and she didn't seem

773.12 --> 779.45
to be as affected in like a physical

776.36 --> 782.63
sense but she said she did say that she

779.45 --> 786.74
did notice like unusual mood swings that

782.63 --> 789.4399999999999
would happen to her not extreme not like

786.74 --> 792.26
super agitated she was much more control

789.44 --> 794.6600000000001
that way journalized but she did feel

792.26 --> 799.91
like being in the presence of it and it

794.66 --> 801.8299999999999
was like agitating so yeah I have

799.91 --> 805.66
personal experience with it and it I

801.83 --> 805.6600000000001
find it extremely unpleasant

811.07 --> 814.46
and that's why it kind of brought back

812.96 --> 819.26
all trauma but at the same time I

814.46 --> 822.6800000000001
realized that I don't know right over

819.26 --> 824.9
here doesn't seem to be extra forwarded

822.68 --> 826.9699999999999
again I think that there would be too

824.9 --> 829.43
much pushback I hope there would be too

826.97 --> 831.44
much pushback they're just focusing more

829.43 --> 834.1099999999999
on the climate measuring nonsense

831.44 --> 839.87
just to make everybody poor that seems

834.11 --> 843.83
to be that the Dutch yeah the Dutch

839.87 --> 847.88
focus of the the dark ones here more 5g

843.83 --> 850.64
is kind of past I think I hope hope it

847.88 --> 852.98
stays that way but I'm gonna basically

850.64 --> 858.43
spend more time just calming down and

852.98 --> 860.45
just remember that I survived it too

858.43 --> 861.9399999999999
even though I thought it was extremely

860.45 --> 866.0600000000001
unpleasant

861.94 --> 869.96
it typically influenced my mood in a

866.06 --> 873.29
great deal and yeah gets me more angry

869.96 --> 875.96
and it's it's kind of weird because I

873.29 --> 878.54
even talk about this with my either

875.96 --> 881.69
because he's very very well aware of

878.54 --> 883.9399999999999
this and knows much deeper implications

881.69 --> 885.8000000000001
of it all and that's kind of the thing

883.94 --> 888.6500000000001
that I don't want to share just like

885.8 --> 895.0699999999999
that's just too much and I don't think

888.65 --> 897.47
it's the right you need to learn a

895.07 --> 900.7
couple of things and you like master

897.47 --> 911.11
them before you can handle that [ __ ] so

900.7 --> 911.11
right comes down to that I lost track

912.959 --> 916.529
it wasn't gonna explain that man I was

914.819 --> 921.899
talking about something else if I GI

916.529 --> 923.1
survived it right I will probably

921.899 --> 931.769
survive through it

923.1 --> 933.36
it's just also that I feel this I did

931.769 --> 939.439
yeah I know it's almost like a question

933.36 --> 942.54
to God like why why is this happening

939.439 --> 946.439
this is like this is really some great

942.54 --> 949.29
outcome I don't know man it's just that

946.439 --> 953.429
I'm just pissed off and having trouble

949.29 --> 957.3
handling it I guess just why does this

953.429 --> 960.439
keep happening like why are why our

957.3 --> 960.439
government so evil

968.76 --> 974.8
anyway yeah I hope you guys survive

972.279 --> 975.64
through it and Faraday cages yeah well I

974.8 --> 979.0889999999999
don't have one

975.64 --> 981.49
sorry yeah they're so good look there

979.089 --> 984.7900000000001
were all kinds of ideas I had like big

981.49 --> 985.0
ones big ideas yeah you need money for

984.79 --> 988.0
that

985.0 --> 991.51
and yeah then my ex pretty much dumped

988.0 --> 994.57
me and then I was screwed and saddled up

991.51 --> 999.75
even with that yeah that yet so yeah

994.57 --> 1004.019
bye-bye ideas I had huge a lot of ideas

999.75 --> 1009.48
okay and it's just it's no use it's done

1004.019 --> 1013.589
we use I should have spent my time on I

1009.48 --> 1016.1
don't know actually getting my my wheel

1013.589 --> 1021.48
together and kind of building a business

1016.1 --> 1023.279
for real but yeah it just felt like I

1021.48 --> 1026.49
couldn't really do it alone but I just

1023.279 --> 1028.89
did not have the confidence and there

1026.49 --> 1031.049
were not any people that I could lean on

1028.89 --> 1034.679
to help me out with this they were not

1031.049 --> 1036.6
there and in a way yeah it was my own

1034.679 --> 1044.449
fault because I had been behaving like a

1036.6 --> 1049.799
complete idiot like some I don't know

1044.449 --> 1053.8200000000002
yeah some stupid like fantasies left

1049.799 --> 1056.91
this kind of anti-social anti societal

1053.82 --> 1059.309
but in a in a senseless way not in a

1056.91 --> 1062.3700000000001
retract affray but like pretty like yeah

1059.309 --> 1066.1499999999999
I hate you all and and you're all stupid

1062.37 --> 1067.53
and arrogant in a way I wouldn't yeah it

1066.15 --> 1069.21
wasn't on the YouTube channel or

1067.53 --> 1071.6689999999999
anything but I would had that attitude I

1069.21 --> 1075.419
was elitist wannabe

1071.669 --> 1079.47
in a way it's I'm really ashamed I'm

1075.419 --> 1084.3300000000002
really ashamed that I was like that it's

1079.47 --> 1085.679
so embarrassing the retrospect and the

1084.33 --> 1088.02
other thing I really happened is that I

1085.679 --> 1090.5700000000002
just shot myself in the foot effectively

1088.02 --> 1092.429
because of all that should a freaking

1090.57 --> 1097.01
bill the best I had money I could have

1092.429 --> 1097.01
built a business I was just too busy

1097.17 --> 1104.6200000000001
being an idiot and I hate myself for it

1100.9 --> 1109.75
but yeah I was at the same time tied

1104.62 --> 1112.9599999999998
into things and got into certain type of

1109.75 --> 1118.63
people that that just made me kind of

1112.96 --> 1120.64
lose control but yeah I've completely

1118.63 --> 1124.75
weaned myself off them now

1120.64 --> 1128.5900000000001
so they're not yeah they can in a direct

1124.75 --> 1130.36
sense in a social sense manipulate me in

1128.59 --> 1132.01
a way and like reinforce my bad

1130.36 --> 1135.87
qualities because that is something they

1132.01 --> 1139.78
literally did they would effectively

1135.87 --> 1144.4899999999998
like knowingly try to reinforce bad

1139.78 --> 1147.82
qualities of mine yeah and if I first

1144.49 --> 1150.19
thought that was kind of trendy and now

1147.82 --> 1155.1399999999999
I realized it's just evil and I just

1150.19 --> 1156.67
didn't realize it and yeah I'm really

1155.14 --> 1159.43
glad that I stepped away from that I

1156.67 --> 1162.43
pretty much stepped away from it when

1159.43 --> 1164.46
flat earth happened to me 2015 and it

1162.43 --> 1166.8400000000001
kind of went to the last

1164.46 --> 1169.63
connections of the friends circle

1166.84 --> 1174.58
whatever you could call it just told

1169.63 --> 1178.99
them and they were super offended they

1174.58 --> 1182.35
were like acid yeah metaphorical acid

1178.99 --> 1186.52
coming out of their mouth so viscerally

1182.35 --> 1188.35
angry that yeah after that just like

1186.52 --> 1191.1299999999999
okay this is never gonna get it fixed

1188.35 --> 1193.4199999999998
again like they will never accept it

1191.13 --> 1197.7700000000002
felt like they wanted to kill me for

1193.42 --> 1199.72
that and it's weird because again that

1197.77 --> 1202.68
ties into the whole vision experience

1199.72 --> 1207.0
that overlaps even that period and this

1202.68 --> 1211.1200000000001
with the weird covert threats threats

1207.0 --> 1213.4
concerning death to me that be entities

1211.12 --> 1215.62
in there for whatever they're supposed

1213.4 --> 1218.3200000000002
to be they were representations of

1215.62 --> 1221.26
myself or representations of outside

1218.32 --> 1224.08
entities I'm not even sure but they

1221.26 --> 1226.39
would threaten me like you're you're

1224.08 --> 1229.09
gonna go in a flat earth that means

1226.39 --> 1229.8500000000001
you're gonna die like that just like

1229.09 --> 1235.9099999999999
that and

1229.85 --> 1238.8799999999999
it's that [ __ ] has haunted me and I I

1235.91 --> 1242.0
couldn't stop myself anyway

1238.88 --> 1244.64
it's just it was there was nowhere else

1242.0 --> 1246.919
left to go for me I would I had to

1244.64 --> 1251.3600000000001
awaken to this I had to figure it out I

1246.919 --> 1252.919
had to rediscover my qualities that have

1251.36 --> 1261.4599999999998
all been buried on there all this

1252.919 --> 1264.5590000000002
madness before that and it was safer

1261.46 --> 1266.78
than I thought as it was happening as it

1264.559 --> 1268.3999999999999
was seeing all that stuff happened marks

1266.78 --> 1271.76
Arjun and all that and people just

1268.4 --> 1274.039
coming out was very suspicious very very

1271.76 --> 1276.2
suspicious and nervous about it all like

1274.039 --> 1278.9
this okay yeah like when is this gonna

1276.2 --> 1281.3300000000002
be taken down like like really seriously

1278.9 --> 1286.6100000000001
under big pressure it's like this is

1281.33 --> 1292.1299999999999
scary how is this possible like this

1286.61 --> 1295.2199999999998
must be some kind of trick because not

1292.13 --> 1297.44
that I thought it was fake I just

1295.22 --> 1299.809
thought I'd been confronted in so many

1297.44 --> 1303.789
ways with that it's like dangerous

1299.809 --> 1307.22
deadly and all that without yeah and

1303.789 --> 1310.82
then I figured later on that a lot of it

1307.22 --> 1314.45
is just illusion I've been like a part

1310.82 --> 1319.22
of my life I've been like coached by

1314.45 --> 1323.059
people that just kind of created yeah I

1319.22 --> 1326.0
stepped into an illusion that was it's a

1323.059 --> 1328.58
huge societal spell like a leftist spell

1326.0 --> 1332.539
I stepped into that partially part of it

1328.58 --> 1336.559
and then they use that insight to kind

1332.539 --> 1339.2
of weave this dream around me and uphold

1336.559 --> 1343.52
this image that there is like a

1339.2 --> 1346.039
monolithic control like a mind control

1343.52 --> 1349.34
that nobody could escape like like

1346.039 --> 1351.74
agents from the matrix that level almost

1349.34 --> 1354.799
sometimes it seemed like that sometimes

1351.74 --> 1359.809
and it was so convincing to me that I

1354.799 --> 1362.91
literally thought like I'm it's almost

1359.809 --> 1365.7
like how did I arrive in this world

1362.91 --> 1369.0500000000002
in this world where I seem to be like oh

1365.7 --> 1371.16
yeah I feel almost like I'm the only

1369.05 --> 1374.03
sentient being left

1371.16 --> 1376.6200000000001
it was almost experienced like that

1374.03 --> 1378.95
didn't it is pure mind control when I

1376.62 --> 1381.33
was subjected to and it makes you

1378.95 --> 1384.54
changes everything the way you look at

1381.33 --> 1393.4499999999998
things it's it's pretty bizarre talking

1384.54 --> 1396.12
back about that but I'm out of it now to

1393.45 --> 1400.74
have been for a while and now discover

1396.12 --> 1404.12
that the concept the framework that

1400.74 --> 1409.01
seems to be laid behind it all based on

1404.12 --> 1409.01
on voluntarism in a way it's like

1409.73 --> 1418.79
there's threats but if you go then they

1413.52 --> 1421.8
can't really stop you as it were or yeah

1418.79 --> 1423.99
not those same people that threaten you

1421.8 --> 1427.61
and that we've all these illusions I

1423.99 --> 1430.92
think there's other parties out there

1427.61 --> 1434.04
that if you step out of line too much as

1430.92 --> 1437.52
it were you start to get really physical

1434.04 --> 1440.52
in yeah heavy ways then they kind of do

1437.52 --> 1448.26
step in I don't know it it it seems like

1440.52 --> 1451.26
that anyway so yeah a lot of it is all

1448.26 --> 1456.15
the spells or most of them oh now all of

1451.26 --> 1458.76
them really are based on giving you

1456.15 --> 1460.8600000000001
something and then you latch on to it

1458.76 --> 1466.41
you start to believe it you make it your

1460.86 --> 1468.9299999999998
own and that introduces like a framework

1466.41 --> 1471.95
in your entire being in your mindset

1468.93 --> 1476.88
that the designers the people that have

1471.95 --> 1480.1200000000001
helped design this that spell can then

1476.88 --> 1485.8100000000002
use there's options to them available to

1480.12 --> 1488.81
work with there comes the exploitation

1485.81 --> 1488.81
see

1490.91 --> 1500.3400000000001
anyway right and yeah the corona

1497.66 --> 1503.96
situations fall false perfectly in line

1500.34 --> 1508.98
with this is it is exactly like a spell

1503.96 --> 1511.73
and the five G is slightly different

1508.98 --> 1514.68
because it is not being overtly

1511.73 --> 1516.96
announced like how great it is it no

1514.68 --> 1519.0600000000002
it's being covertly introduced and that

1516.96 --> 1523.83
makes it very different from a spell

1519.06 --> 1526.2
that makes it technological control so

1523.83 --> 1529.22
it's on the other side spells are

1526.2 --> 1532.65
illusions are there to goad the people

1529.22 --> 1534.66
drive them into certain directions but

1532.65 --> 1536.7900000000002
the technological applications are the

1534.66 --> 1538.2900000000002
control mechanisms that they also try to

1536.79 --> 1542.03
forward and there's more in their

1538.29 --> 1545.52
direction of police police state control

1542.03 --> 1550.77
to manage those the yeah those that step

1545.52 --> 1553.83
away from the spells and I don't know

1550.77 --> 1557.4
get the idea to maybe really stop them

1553.83 --> 1560.1299999999999
or to who knows where people may go once

1557.4 --> 1562.2900000000002
they break free and they fear that of

1560.13 --> 1564.5100000000002
course they fear that too many people

1562.29 --> 1567.1499999999999
will wake up and then start to take

1564.51 --> 1569.76
serious action really knowing how it

1567.15 --> 1572.91
works because then they're in trouble

1569.76 --> 1575.1299999999999
partially so they crack down on that

1572.91 --> 1580.16
[ __ ] they cracked the sensor censorship

1575.13 --> 1583.88
is really the the weapon of choice

1580.16 --> 1587.73
because that is where yeah censorship

1583.88 --> 1590.1000000000001
does in a way stop the spreading of

1587.73 --> 1592.95
information through this network that is

1590.1 --> 1599.1299999999999
also like our the richest source of

1592.95 --> 1601.77
awakening so yeah they they make the

1599.13 --> 1605.96
internet like a body like just like I

1601.77 --> 1609.12
had people that did that with me goad me

1605.96 --> 1612.06
drive me in the directions tell stories

1609.12 --> 1615.33
that typically bring me in a mindset now

1612.06 --> 1618.72
the internet or more specifically

1615.33 --> 1621.0
YouTube their algorithm their suggestion

1618.72 --> 1621.75
list they're keeping track of your

1621.0 --> 1627.08
record

1621.75 --> 1629.46
sizing you up but you like that is

1627.08 --> 1633.57
exactly like a buddy

1629.46 --> 1634.79
that does that to you what those guys

1633.57 --> 1637.86
did to me

1634.79 --> 1642.06
do you understand they they digitized

1637.86 --> 1644.49
that system and standardized it for

1642.06 --> 1647.85
everyone to manipulate everybody into a

1644.49 --> 1650.03
direction it's pretty bizarre realizing

1647.85 --> 1650.03
that

1666.49 --> 1669.69
[Music]

1678.65 --> 1683.75
and you know I wonder how far it even

1681.23 --> 1686.3600000000001
goes with this type of algorithm I think

1683.75 --> 1689.63
that if you even try to have your own

1686.36 --> 1692.6599999999999
video types of platforms you can use

1689.63 --> 1700.25
your own algorithm and unleash that on

1692.66 --> 1702.8600000000001
that - well it yeah an algorithm that

1700.25 --> 1705.44
yeah that that manipulates it's like

1702.86 --> 1707.75
inevitable even if you just want to give

1705.44 --> 1711.559
exactly what the people want the problem

1707.75 --> 1713.03
is is that people technically on a super

1711.559 --> 1714.86
high intellectual level don't really

1713.03 --> 1717.59
know what they want but they'll deal

1714.86 --> 1720.32
with whatever is presented to them so at

1717.59 --> 1722.11
a certain point absolute freedom just

1720.32 --> 1725.45
doesn't yield anything anymore

1722.11 --> 1729.05
but the the algorithm and the bay'

1725.45 --> 1732.2
database has better oversight then as to

1729.05 --> 1734.72
what is really around so they will then

1732.2 --> 1736.7
try to basically continue the learning

1734.72 --> 1738.8
process and therefore goading in a

1736.7 --> 1741.1100000000001
specific direction it's like inevitable

1738.8 --> 1743.33
it's inevitable to do that so any

1741.11 --> 1744.29
platform that has an algorithm that does

1743.33 --> 1749.05
that sort of thing that brings

1744.29 --> 1752.6299999999999
suggestions they just have this power

1749.05 --> 1758.74
automatically no matters on how they

1752.63 --> 1758.74
program it how manipulative they make it

1772.91 --> 1780.26
5g is not sentient janggeum 'acts

1776.51 --> 1784.1299999999999
ridiculous like vitamin C protects

1780.26 --> 1786.14
protects on a cellular level and that

1784.13 --> 1790.7800000000002
assists against all kinds of stresses

1786.14 --> 1795.23
including radiological stresses you know

1790.78 --> 1796.97
it does my problem is I don't want to

1795.23 --> 1799.3700000000001
live in a world where everybody has to

1796.97 --> 1801.23
constantly keep taking stuff just to be

1799.37 --> 1804.86
able to survive I think that is

1801.23 --> 1808.79
absolutely repulsive it is a form of

1804.86 --> 1813.3799999999999
medical slavery do you understand

1808.79 --> 1815.99
if to survive that you must take certain

1813.38 --> 1817.7900000000002
things besides just regular food that is

1815.99 --> 1821.09
available you must take certain things

1817.79 --> 1826.67
just to be able to survive I think that

1821.09 --> 1830.2099999999998
is that is a terrible situation and

1826.67 --> 1834.91
that's why I really want to wean off the

1830.21 --> 1840.47
radiological radiological I want this

1834.91 --> 1845.69
phone system to stop what they're doing

1840.47 --> 1848.42
and replace it with much better

1845.69 --> 1851.63
technology just much better and not

1848.42 --> 1854.96
anymore later ad illogical [ __ ] no

1851.63 --> 1857.39
something that just doesn't have any

1854.96 --> 1859.78
detrimental influence I know it's out

1857.39 --> 1862.1000000000001
there I've conceptualized things

1859.78 --> 1865.01
fortunately I've even had concept that

1862.1 --> 1867.53
are based on quantum mechanics but in

1865.01 --> 1868.78
retrospect it seems that they're

1867.53 --> 1870.71
probably based on certain

1868.78 --> 1875.21
presuppositional theories that will

1870.71 --> 1877.75
probably not work out but the options

1875.21 --> 1881.57
are there and even just cable technology

1877.75 --> 1884.39
is upgraded so much is so strong it was

1881.57 --> 1888.98
always incredibly strong it really was

1884.39 --> 1895.65
like even in the 90s the fiberglass that

1888.98 --> 1898.08
was laid was just incredibly powerful so

1895.65 --> 1901.77
that's what I really want I think it

1898.08 --> 1904.35
could literally save nature and save our

1901.77 --> 1910.32
minds and our hearts it could just stop

1904.35 --> 1912.03
making people die slowly or quickly you

1910.32 --> 1914.79
know that depends some people will be

1912.03 --> 1918.1499999999999
very detrimental II influenced in a very

1914.79 --> 1921.6299999999999
short time span get things get very sick

1918.15 --> 1923.4
and others well barely notice it well

1921.63 --> 1926.4
they will notice it when just the

1923.4 --> 1928.8000000000002
average lifespan certainly has gone down

1926.4 --> 1931.2900000000002
at the end of their lives and they just

1928.8 --> 1933.59
noticed like wow yeah our generation

1931.29 --> 1936.51
seems to be dying off a lot quicker than

1933.59 --> 1940.3799999999999
the previous one despite all the [ __ ]

1936.51 --> 1943.26
they've been through because in a

1940.38 --> 1946.5
certain growing period they were not

1943.26 --> 1950.7
heavily subjected to 5g and all that

1946.5 --> 1955.02
[ __ ] oh oh yeah yeah well you'll know

1950.7 --> 1959.52
you'll know in 40 years there's anyone

1955.02 --> 1963.21
left then okay

1959.52 --> 1965.73
so yeah sit back sit back faith and just

1963.21 --> 1972.3600000000001
sit in that tree like a cat and just see

1965.73 --> 1974.429
what happens yeah you know just because

1972.36 --> 1976.1399999999999
you don't see something changing me like

1974.429 --> 1979.3200000000002
just because it's not some kind of

1976.14 --> 1982.2
sniper turret in shooting things bang

1979.32 --> 1986.1599999999999
bang bang does it mean that there's no

1982.2 --> 1989.51
damage happening and yeah the tests have

1986.16 --> 1993.03
been done Denmark

1989.51 --> 2000.35
very elaborate tests on all all types of

1993.03 --> 2003.02
organisms and yeah it damages it just I

2000.35 --> 2008.4699999999998
think it's just over over one generation

2003.02 --> 2008.47
even so

2011.07 --> 2018.4099999999999
yeah anyway let's move on

2021.43 --> 2028.53

oh god he showed he was playing this

2041.559 --> 2052.919
song so that was so down his lane it's

2047.71 --> 2057.07
like this really really jolly friendly

2052.919 --> 2061.44
American old-fashioned song and it was

2057.07 --> 2068.3500000000004
about all the cost that it was just so

2061.44 --> 2071.139
heavy heavy comedy it's just staggering

2068.35 --> 2075.31
I couldn't believe my ears just seeing

2071.139 --> 2080.7400000000002
it it's just what yeah yeah big bears

2075.31 --> 2089.2599999999998

to six up votes now even though it like

2101.23 --> 2111.2400000000002
ended up with 23 hmm that's completely

2108.22 --> 2111.24
normal right

2122.65 --> 2125.4300000000003
yep

2125.73 --> 2136.2
Nathan Thompson also posted a pretty

2128.579 --> 2149.3590000000004
interesting video well thank you guys up

2136.2 --> 2149.359
if I can find it right

2154.19 --> 2161.9
that's a combined video it's a little

2158.55 --> 2165.7200000000003
david icke in there as well it it is

2161.9 --> 2169.79
relatively basic but it's yeah that's

2165.72 --> 2174.87
what it is then this gets really weird

2169.79 --> 2176.91
like really freaking weird and there's

2174.87 --> 2178.83
no use pondering over that or going

2176.91 --> 2188.3399999999997
going completely so Vanya even though

2178.83 --> 2190.35
it's just like come on people I don't

2188.34 --> 2194.67
know that's probably some people that I

2190.35 --> 2196.62
think Nathan is just really really

2194.67 --> 2198.9
annoyed right now sorry Nathan

2196.62 --> 2201.9
sorry Paul I don't know what you think

2198.9 --> 2207.6800000000003
of it it's just I have a history with

2201.9 --> 2211.35
this [ __ ] you know and I felt it and

2207.68 --> 2216.0899999999997
I've seen the dead insects and [ __ ] and

2211.35 --> 2218.39
I just freaking hate it it's as simple

2216.09 --> 2218.3900000000003
as that

2235.07 --> 2241.25
right so I guess everybody's gonna talk

2238.46 --> 2242.81
just about 5g and Corona from now on

2241.25 --> 2246.53
there's not gonna be any more interest

2242.81 --> 2249.64
in Flat Earth I guess it's like it's

2246.53 --> 2252.8900000000003
over with flowers this one black swan

2249.64 --> 2262.25
killed the globe from many different

2252.89 --> 2265.18
angles that it maybe I should just start

2262.25 --> 2265.18
calling my show

2266.86 --> 2274.9300000000003
Corona 5g earlybird how about that what

2271.61 --> 2274.9300000000003
do you think what do you guys think

2300.45 --> 2320.2
finally that took a while over moco it's

2311.319 --> 2325.359
called trying to get your attention okay

2320.2 --> 2328.6899999999996
no I was just joking but you know in a

2325.359 --> 2330.819
way I sympathize with Nathan in the

2328.69 --> 2334.029
sense that I am getting kind of sick of

2330.819 --> 2337.93
talking about it as well I know it's

2334.029 --> 2341.319
like the thing now because it is the

2337.93 --> 2343.8999999999996
thing now it's just that I'm already

2341.319 --> 2345.759
kind of done with it even even though

2343.9 --> 2349.2400000000002
there's more much more to it but I'm

2345.759 --> 2352.049
just not ready to go there yet just

2349.24 --> 2354.5389999999998
don't take any freaking vaccines okay

2352.049 --> 2361.44
it's as simple as that

2354.539 --> 2361.44
ever under any circumstance

2377.04 --> 2381.98
it's watch for an element no yeah

2386.57 --> 2392.4500000000003
or yes depending on what you're gonna

2389.13 --> 2392.4500000000003
describe as an element

2419.42 --> 2424.849

2422.029 --> 2431.99
pushing it so hard I don't know what

2424.849 --> 2437.779
what this is it's like like I don't know

2431.99 --> 2439.1899999999996
I I think like if he it just feels like

2437.779 --> 2448.39
he's getting in trouble

2439.19 --> 2448.39
like this is so extreme it's like yeah

2453.289 --> 2458.969
it almost like a pride before the fall

2456.479 --> 2461.189
situation maybe oh by the way Thank You

2458.969 --> 2463.439

2516.82 --> 2520.0800000000004
you for the nickel good servant

2534.799 --> 2545.549
those birds are really enjoying them in

2538.559 --> 2547.6800000000003
the water now look as soon as I like

2545.549 --> 2549.839
fill up the bowl and put it there it's

2547.68 --> 2553.44
like immediately the first bird that has

2549.839 --> 2555.8289999999997
Chad's just dives into it and starts

2553.44 --> 2555.829
bathing

2561.92 --> 2569.37
Amanda thinks the contraptions that I

2564.48 --> 2572.9
thought up to build like I would try to

2569.37 --> 2576.06
like give a try to somehow make like a a

2572.9 --> 2579.6600000000003
bird a sort of bird paradise situation

2576.06 --> 2581.58
if I had had a garden you know because I

2579.66 --> 2584.72
would give them I would try to see if I

2581.58 --> 2588.5099999999998
could make like refilling automated

2584.72 --> 2592.1899999999996
bathtubs for birds that kind of can keep

2588.51 --> 2598.25
it clean you know so it doesn't clog up

2592.19 --> 2601.19
I don't know man I yeah so it's like

2598.25 --> 2607.17
[Music]

2601.19 --> 2609.69
parks for animals I don't know it's

2607.17 --> 2612.98
something that I always thought was like

2609.69 --> 2612.98
really amusing

2619.609 --> 2624.44
yeah yeah I don't know you could bring

2622.369 --> 2626.719
it pretty far even you know depending on

2624.44 --> 2628.819
how well the region is doing I don't

2626.719 --> 2631.88
know maybe it's just silly silly ideas

2628.819 --> 2635.029
of mine that you could make it like a

2631.88 --> 2640.4
park situation where a park is built

2635.029 --> 2643.309
around what I guess that even this part

2640.4 --> 2644.9300000000003
here is kind of like that it has animals

2643.309 --> 2647.2090000000003
in there as well although the it is

2644.93 --> 2649.16
fenced off that's already kind of the

2647.209 --> 2654.489
effect it's like a park and there's

2649.16 --> 2657.979
animals there but I don't know how about

2654.489 --> 2660.349
birds and [ __ ] doing extra things I

2657.979 --> 2663.43
don't know this is just nonsense don't

2660.349 --> 2667.13
pay attention to me this is just my own

2663.43 --> 2670.459
silly little snobbish garden projects if

2667.13 --> 2672.7690000000002
I would ever have to ever get some money

2670.459 --> 2675.3489999999997
and a real garden I don't know if that's

2672.769 --> 2676.8489999999997
even ever gonna happen and even if I did

2675.349 --> 2684.549
get it I probably no longer have any

2676.849 --> 2684.549
time for it yeah hmm but who knows

2698.27 --> 2704.52
no John John Mac and I just called

2702.09 --> 2710.7000000000003
dollars superjet dollars I call it a

2704.52 --> 2715.95
nickel I know it's not a nickel I don't

2710.7 --> 2719.7599999999998
know it's I derived that from from open

2715.95 --> 2723.6899999999996
Benjamin I'll just throw a nickel I send

2719.76 --> 2726.0
them on this way I don't know maybe you

2723.69 --> 2727.9500000000003
think it's stupid when I say that I

2726.0 --> 2732.03
don't know I think it's funny I'm gonna

2727.95 --> 2734.25
call it a nickel and who knows with the

2732.03 --> 2736.8
inflation that may be right in front of

2734.25 --> 2739.89
the door for the United States it may

2736.8 --> 2742.98
pretty much become a nickel I don't know

2739.89 --> 2746.75
maybe it won't not trying to it's not a

2742.98 --> 2746.75
prediction you know

2758.72 --> 2765.64
the nickel is toxic well not necessarily

2769.75 --> 2776.52
some people have nickel allergies though

2772.09 --> 2779.8900000000003
I am NOT one of those people thank God

2776.52 --> 2781.93
but yeah yeah you don't want to be like

2779.89 --> 2785.41
sprayed in nickel powder or anything

2781.93 --> 2787.62
okay yeah of course you can have to

2785.41 --> 2787.62
watch

2798.3 --> 2803.04
you wouldn't let Nick oh no I would

2800.16 --> 2810.18
neither especially because yeah Nick Oh

2803.04 --> 2813.27
does dissolve and things and so life I

2810.18 --> 2819.99
may be some one of them that was yeah

2813.27 --> 2823.28
especially the oxidated layer I think I

2819.99 --> 2823.2799999999997
don't know I wouldn't like it either

2825.32 --> 2831.119
now silver on the other hand that's a

2828.42 --> 2833.9300000000003
whole nother matter even if there is

2831.119 --> 2833.9300000000003
some copper in it

2838.6 --> 2841.69
[Music]

2861.12 --> 2864.47
are you talking about

2866.68 --> 2869.91
[Music]

2873.26 --> 2876.5200000000004
food for the gods

2880.04 --> 2885.94
time for goats goats are awesome

2890.49 --> 2895.35
especially really small ones they're so

2892.78 --> 2895.3500000000004
freakin cute

2914.38 --> 2918.4
what are you talking about dank

2941.849 --> 2944.4790000000003
what

2959.749 --> 2969.299
no I don't yeah that's another way of

2966.869 --> 2971.67
looking at it badge badge as long as you

2969.299 --> 2973.94
don't want your nickel back yeah because

2971.67 --> 2976.94
people that want their nickel back are

2973.94 --> 2976.94
terrible

2989.77 --> 2993.09
[Music]

2994.08 --> 2998.74
unless of course you bought something

2996.82 --> 3001.86
with the nickel and it was false

2998.74 --> 3005.7599999999998
advertised but that's something else but

3001.86 --> 3009.54
a nickel given and then wanted back

3005.76 --> 3011.7000000000003
that's a terrible thing yeah

3009.54 --> 3014.63
Nickelback worse than that there was the

3011.7 --> 3014.6299999999997
joke as well

3015.19 --> 3018.429
[Music]

3029.25 --> 3034.41
yeah I think there's a lot of people

3031.45 --> 3034.41
that agree on that

3035.55 --> 3038.659
[Music]

3045.75 --> 3052.0
if wooden nickels are flammable yeah I

3048.7 --> 3057.0699999999997
think that wood is flammable that's

3052.0 --> 3059.92
right you know a band writes its own

3057.07 --> 3062.65
music how do you know well there is a

3059.92 --> 3064.3
way to tell Geoffrey Bill but yeah you

3062.65 --> 3066.7000000000003
gotta have two senses for it you gotta

3064.3 --> 3070.59
have spirit senses but if somebody wrote

3066.7 --> 3074.68
their own song then you will know that

3070.59 --> 3076.9900000000002
when they perform it especially earlier

3074.68 --> 3081.7599999999998
on because they will have like personal

3076.99 --> 3084.25
investment in this and that shows you

3081.76 --> 3088.0200000000004
can tell when somebody's playing their

3084.25 --> 3090.67
own song because then they developed it

3088.02 --> 3094.6
that means they build it step by step

3090.67 --> 3106.42
and that shows see that's how you know

3094.6 --> 3109.45
somebody made their own music it also

3106.42 --> 3111.42
usually means they just love it can't

3109.45 --> 3115.5299999999997
really make a song if you don't love it

3111.42 --> 3115.53
or it's really important to you

3144.5 --> 3147.61
[Music]

3154.96 --> 3158.32
[Music]

3167.49 --> 3178.95
mm man I feel so much comedy yesterday

3172.2 --> 3184.08
oh yeah I don't really know what to make

3178.95 --> 3192.5699999999997
of this weather you know it's that

3184.08 --> 3195.21
consistent that another dune landscape

3192.57 --> 3203.21
up there and underneath there's that's

3195.21 --> 3205.86
actual moist Club that's cumulus that

3203.21 --> 3209.01
definitely is not there's nothing

3205.86 --> 3212.61
natural it's not saris that's not normal

3209.01 --> 3214.8900000000003
saris that doesn't form that way and

3212.61 --> 3216.7200000000003
these are almost like sheep clouds but

3214.89 --> 3217.79
yeah just look at the pattern they're

3216.72 --> 3222.6499999999996
not all over

3217.79 --> 3228.119
so that's local it's not natural

3222.65 --> 3230.7000000000003
potential induced that cloud however is

3228.119 --> 3233.27
not that's typically moist from the heat

3230.7 --> 3233.27
probably

3260.219 --> 3263.219
yeah

3272.579 --> 3282.099
okay Capel you have a band and you're

3275.95 --> 3284.74
touring how is that working out ah capo

3282.099 --> 3289.53
I like that music was better when ugly

3284.74 --> 3289.5299999999997
people were allowed to make it yeah

3301.45 --> 3305.29
and the funny thing is you know if they

3303.46 --> 3307.84
even have like the balls to perform and

3305.29 --> 3311.47
all that there's this weird thing where

3307.84 --> 3313.48
they you think Oh ugly and then they

3311.47 --> 3316.24
actually perform their music and then

3313.48 --> 3317.76
it's like no that person's not ugly

3316.24 --> 3323.41
anymore

3317.76 --> 3326.32
that's an amazing person but yeah I

3323.41 --> 3332.62
don't know I do have a like special

3326.32 --> 3342.6400000000003
place for for music qualities so in my

3332.62 --> 3350.5899999999997
heart a really quick note how how is it

3342.64 --> 3353.17
dead I know maybe maybe Flat Earth is

3350.59 --> 3357.6400000000003
kind of now ready to retire because

3353.17 --> 3360.19
we've won we've won the war ballers are

3357.64 --> 3364.99
still squirming around still trying to

3360.19 --> 3368.23
ignore everything but lab we could

3364.99 --> 3370.93
technically retire it's just that it

3368.23 --> 3375.67
seems that we need to like hang around

3370.93 --> 3378.94
to kind of defend people or just give

3375.67 --> 3381.25
people some extra encouragement against

3378.94 --> 3387.31
the the baller and others and which are

3381.25 --> 3392.02
yeah in the media as well it's just but

3387.31 --> 3393.49
the subject of Flat Earth itself versus

3392.02 --> 3395.47
the ball that is yeah it's completely

3393.49 --> 3398.1099999999997
done it's completely done

3395.47 --> 3400.54
we've won there's nothing really left

3398.11 --> 3403.7200000000003
for the ballers except doublethink

3400.54 --> 3405.19
and [ __ ] so that's pretty much done

3403.72 --> 3410.5
although that doesn't mean that we

3405.19 --> 3413.56
actually know the complete design and

3410.5 --> 3416.86
orientation geometrically of the land

3413.56 --> 3420.25
masses and it's all confines of our

3416.86 --> 3422.65
realm just yet those questions have been

3420.25 --> 3424.48
asked I've put them forward many times

3422.65 --> 3427.51
that is what you need to know in order

3424.48 --> 3430.05
to take the next step into figuring out

3427.51 --> 3433.5
the design and layout of the realm

3430.05 --> 3439.65
starting with the equatorial orientation

3433.5 --> 3439.65
and from there on yeah more steps

3445.449 --> 3449.539
yeah but that requires a lot of

3447.68 --> 3454.8489999999997
fieldwork and guess what a lot of

3449.539 --> 3458.449
fieldwork requires money and green

3454.849 --> 3461.779
lights green lights cooperation that's

3458.449 --> 3465.439
gonna be tough I don't think even if we

3461.779 --> 3468.769
gather all this money and like come the

3465.439 --> 3471.319
flat earthers guild or whatever I don't

3468.769 --> 3474.529
think that we'd get any cooperation even

3471.319 --> 3476.839
if we had that because we're still

3474.529 --> 3479.359
pretty much going against one of the

3476.839 --> 3486.769
foundations of world religion literally

3479.359 --> 3489.0989999999997
world religion so but as for the

3486.769 --> 3491.93
technical debate globe versus Flat Earth

3489.099 --> 3496.339
whatever you conceive that flat earth to

3491.93 --> 3500.6499999999996
be like yeah that's just done we've won

3496.339 --> 3500.65
it's over the war is over

3506.84 --> 3509.929
[Music]

3510.09 --> 3517.57
so with that I'm gonna run out the show

3514.29 --> 3520.09
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

3517.57 --> 3523.63
like this show did actually get a little

3520.09 --> 3528.48
Flat Earth in there but yeah at the end

3523.63 --> 3531.25
uh was nice eating those berries a lot

3528.48 --> 3533.23
hope I'll be a little bit more joyous

3531.25 --> 3536.32
tomorrow so I can leave all this

3533.23 --> 3537.94
education kind of behind me again I

3536.32 --> 3540.88
explained why that came into being

3537.94 --> 3542.98
because this is like a bit of a

3540.88 --> 3545.11
flashback to psychological warfare

3542.98 --> 3548.68
situation in my own country ten years

3545.11 --> 3551.65
ago of which I was pretty active part

3548.68 --> 3553.99
back then like I was activist I would go

3551.65 --> 3558.19
on the streets I did go on protests I

3553.99 --> 3560.1699999999996
did go to gatherings okay let you

3558.19 --> 3563.7400000000002
physically I had the money to do it that

3560.17 --> 3565.51
then I don't have it anymore now so yeah

3563.74 --> 3568.8399999999997
this brings back some memories this

3565.51 --> 3570.61
situation that's why that's why I'm

3568.84 --> 3572.92
pissed off that's why I'm not easily

3570.61 --> 3576.4
backing down I'm not just sitting back

3572.92 --> 3581.9500000000003
oh they'll go away no no no it'll just

3576.4 --> 3584.59
go worse maybe one step back so I don't

3581.95 --> 3587.68
kind of forget about it it always takes

3584.59 --> 3590.98
two steps back forward after sufficient

3587.68 --> 3593.5899999999997
time has passed and I think that next

3590.98 --> 3597.46
step mostly will be for the Netherlands

3593.59 --> 3601.33
the climate change [ __ ] that they're

3597.46 --> 3602.68
gonna subject us to anyway if you like
