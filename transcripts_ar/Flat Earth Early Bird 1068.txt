80.799 --> 84.47900000000001

84.64 --> 90.56
a little bit more wind

87.92 --> 94.4
just this slow draft

90.56 --> 94.4
uh the clouds are not as thick

94.88 --> 99.36
it's been moments where it's kind of

96.88 --> 102.32
blue in between but right now it's just

99.36 --> 102.32
well like this

103.6 --> 109.28
but yeah to me it's noticeably brighter

106.159 --> 109.28
than it was yesterday

112.84 --> 119.2
right birds are

116.479 --> 119.2

164.8 --> 168.72
it is friday the 12th

167.2 --> 172.76
12th

168.72 --> 172.76
of november 2021

174.08 --> 178.4
be doing a two-hour show as usual

180.56 --> 183.959
where is everybody

185.92 --> 188.23899999999998
huh

194.959 --> 199.12
okay

196.239 --> 201.20000000000002
anyway

199.12 --> 202.8
guess everybody had a late night last

201.2 --> 205.35999999999999
night not surprising there were lots of

202.8 --> 206.48000000000002
streams

205.36 --> 209.87900000000002
i think

206.48 --> 209.879
let me check

213.28 --> 215.68
right

215.76 --> 220.39999999999998
yeah

217.519 --> 222.56
another gnn jesus christ those guys

220.4 --> 223.92000000000002
really push it hard

222.56 --> 226.64000000000001
they're like

223.92 --> 230.55999999999997
like genuinely reversed world acting

226.64 --> 231.51899999999998
like and alex dean takes it so far like

230.56 --> 233.28
dude i

231.519 --> 236.4
like i hope you know what you're doing

233.28 --> 238.64000000000001
man that's like serious reversed world

236.4 --> 241.36
spell casting and like even if you

238.64 --> 243.51899999999998
disclaim it that's

241.36 --> 245.43900000000002
messed up dude

243.519 --> 248.64000000000001
but

245.439 --> 251.519
it is interesting though

248.64 --> 254.51899999999998
they've really found this thing this act

251.519 --> 254.519
and

255.04 --> 258.799
i was looking at it just for curiosity's

257.6 --> 261.6
sake

258.799 --> 264.0
and like how far will they push it

261.6 --> 264.0
anyway

264.479 --> 266.71999999999997
uh

266.8 --> 269.84000000000003
what's that

270.72 --> 274.88000000000005
and yeah premiere i don't know which one

275.36 --> 279.91900000000004
i like i don't know if it was the one

277.36 --> 281.759
where i kind of blew up

279.919 --> 285.75899999999996
i don't even know if it could be that

281.759 --> 285.759
nathan just edited that part out

287.199 --> 292.0
because we were all kind of yet just

289.28 --> 292.0
like yelling

292.56 --> 298.24
at that point not just me although i did

295.36 --> 298.24
get the loudest

298.72 --> 302.56
i don't know

300.4 --> 305.84
like i i wanted to go to bed early i

302.56 --> 308.0
didn't like wanna oh let's keep up just

305.84 --> 311.039
to watch that and then potentially kind

308.0 --> 314.56
of like relive the trauma because to me

311.039 --> 318.0
it was kind of traumatizing at the time

314.56 --> 320.96
not super hard but just

318.0 --> 323.12
i was really stressed out

320.96 --> 324.88
in that situation anyway

323.12 --> 326.56
not a good thing to bring back when you

324.88 --> 329.039
want to go to sleep

326.56 --> 330.639
so i kind of just like mid

329.039 --> 331.759
mid stream

330.639 --> 334.24
premiere

331.759 --> 336.84000000000003
and yeah start good went to bed anyway

334.24 --> 340.479
hello alex g first chat ah

336.84 --> 340.479
finally good to see you

345.28 --> 349.75899999999996
right also

346.56 --> 352.8
dude there's like there's a weirdness

349.759 --> 355.91900000000004
and weirdness

352.8 --> 358.88
like has anybody ever listened to like

355.919 --> 361.88
some of these new premiere intro songs

358.88 --> 364.71999999999997
right we all know the the old song like

361.88 --> 366.4
[Music]

364.72 --> 367.52000000000004
it's not the correct melody but you know

366.4 --> 370.4
with the

367.52 --> 371.919
very invasive loud sounds like you have

370.4 --> 373.59999999999997
something on in the background it's

371.919 --> 374.88
going to premiere but it's like in a few

373.6 --> 377.28000000000003
minutes and you're doing something else

374.88 --> 380.56
and then suddenly bang that music always

377.28 --> 383.11999999999995
comes on so loud right

380.56 --> 386.72
so you hear it immediately well there's

383.12 --> 388.8
other premiere songs now for a while

386.72 --> 391.84000000000003
i don't know exactly when it started i

388.8 --> 392.8
think somewhere this summer or spring

391.84 --> 395.039
but

392.8 --> 396.8
like nathan a lot of well he does a lot

395.039 --> 400.56
of premieres

396.8 --> 403.84000000000003
and yesterday again was like the best

400.56 --> 406.56
premiere song ever

403.84 --> 406.56
it is like

407.52 --> 412.24
music

409.199 --> 414.88
in a style with the sound effect wave

412.24 --> 416.88
electro wave in a way that's

414.88 --> 418.71999999999997
like cliche almost

416.88 --> 420.24
but like the best

418.72 --> 422.639
cliche

420.24 --> 424.639
and like i've been to festivals and

422.639 --> 427.36
parties where so

424.639 --> 430.96000000000004
where songs very typically like that

427.36 --> 433.12
with the melody set up with the harmony

430.96 --> 435.44
would play and it would be awesome like

433.12 --> 437.52
that's like almost a reason i i went to

435.44 --> 439.84
those kind of parties because they had

437.52 --> 442.56
that sort of music and it's in that

439.84 --> 444.88
freaking premiere so i literally

442.56 --> 447.84
listened back to it

444.88 --> 450.8
like five times

447.84 --> 452.96
because like got a real kick out of it

450.8 --> 455.84000000000003
because it's like a really deep far

452.96 --> 458.479
looking feel

455.84 --> 460.479
it's it's magical to me

458.479 --> 462.96
but yeah you can't listen it to it back

460.479 --> 465.36
like once the show is the premiere run

462.96 --> 467.19899999999996
is over then yeah you just get the

465.36 --> 469.759
uploaded video it doesn't have the

467.199 --> 471.039
premiere music added to it

469.759 --> 474.08000000000004
and then

471.039 --> 476.4
i tried to find it like where is this

474.08 --> 478.87899999999996
song you know the premiere doesn't even

476.4 --> 481.35999999999996
like say an artist name or the song name

478.879 --> 482.96000000000004
or anything this is like a mystery song

481.36 --> 484.72
and it's epic

482.96 --> 487.44
like really epic

484.72 --> 489.52000000000004
i try to find it back

487.44 --> 492.16
just searching it through google and

489.52 --> 494.639
it's not out there it's not even a

492.16 --> 495.59900000000005
mention of premiere songs

494.639 --> 498.319
nothing

495.599 --> 501.12
like only that old stupid song it's not

498.319 --> 502.96000000000004
really stupid it's just that's nothing

501.12 --> 505.599
compared to this new stuff

502.96 --> 507.19899999999996
and there's several different new songs

505.599 --> 509.36
not all of them i like there's just

507.199 --> 510.8
minimalist thing it's just not my thing

509.36 --> 512.08
it's boring

510.8 --> 514.32
there's other people that probably

512.08 --> 517.039
really like that it's people that like

514.32 --> 518.88
into minimal but

517.039 --> 524.399
there's a few songs that are really good

518.88 --> 524.399
and that one song is just like wow dude

526.56 --> 532.399
but there's no mention of this

529.36 --> 535.76
any mention

532.399 --> 538.76
like i just searched on google like

535.76 --> 538.76
2021

539.44 --> 544.9590000000001
youtube premiere

542.0 --> 544.959
intro song

545.279 --> 546.88
and

546.08 --> 549.839
just

546.88 --> 552.56
a lot of well oh look the new even

549.839 --> 556.32
deceptively so like oh the new premiere

552.56 --> 559.279
song 2021 and it's the old freaking song

556.32 --> 561.6
so annoying all kinds of that only the

559.279 --> 564.72
old song and like oh

561.6 --> 567.36
look introduction video how can you add

564.72 --> 569.279
your own premieres like dude

567.36 --> 573.32
there's these new songs why is there no

569.279 --> 573.32
mention of this at all

579.68 --> 582.56
anyway

581.44 --> 585.839
uh

582.56 --> 588.56
you were rocking to it the other day

585.839 --> 591.839
right because they're like really done

588.56 --> 591.8389999999999
well done like

592.48 --> 597.6
they studioed the [ __ ] out of those

595.2 --> 597.6
songs

598.88 --> 603.6
it's almost like you're listening to a

600.399 --> 605.44
mini concert or something but anyway

603.6 --> 608.8000000000001
enough about that

605.44 --> 608.8000000000001
uh hey mike sidunich

610.959 --> 616.16
yeah yesterday's flat earth debate was

613.76 --> 616.16
great

616.56 --> 620.8
and

617.839 --> 620.8000000000001
very peaceful

621.04 --> 623.8389999999999
and that was great

624.399 --> 630.64
it's a nice contrast

627.2 --> 633.839
uh flatter school also number 60

630.64 --> 636.48
mitchell from australia i was there

633.839 --> 638.5600000000001
but yeah after a while

636.48 --> 640.0
got this track there were other streams

638.56 --> 641.76
at the same time

640.0 --> 643.92
like qe

641.76 --> 643.92
or

644.079 --> 648.399
betty

646.8 --> 650.56
did another

648.399 --> 652.079
bible interpretation

650.56 --> 656.4799999999999
stream

652.079 --> 656.4799999999999
and i usually don't really follow those

657.04 --> 661.36
because of well

658.399 --> 663.519
part partially because of the accent

661.36 --> 666.24
but i did listen to part of it

663.519 --> 668.72
and it's interesting because she's like

666.24 --> 670.72
she seems to like be very esoteric at

668.72 --> 674.0400000000001
her approach and that's

670.72 --> 674.0400000000001
that's good

675.279 --> 679.279
but

676.16 --> 681.92
then it also kind of mixes in

679.279 --> 683.36
with just the more standardized

681.92 --> 686.0
chant

683.36 --> 688.48
thingies but not bad like she's

686.0 --> 689.36
exploring it's interesting

688.48 --> 692.5600000000001
uh

689.36 --> 692.5600000000001
hey aries 106.

696.48 --> 700.9590000000001
oh right uh yeah

699.04 --> 703.8389999999999
something i completely forgot to mention

700.959 --> 705.5999999999999
yesterday the two days ago watched the

703.839 --> 707.839
movie

705.6 --> 709.9200000000001
and it because that was the day that

707.839 --> 712.0790000000001
like everything got so rough and all

709.92 --> 712.079
that

713.44 --> 716.44
wednesday

717.36 --> 722.48
so yeah i kind of like scroll on netflix

720.8 --> 723.92
and watch the movie that i don't know

722.48 --> 726.399
normally i probably wouldn't click on

723.92 --> 726.399
that but

726.639 --> 731.44
on first glance the the actors were

729.2 --> 733.9200000000001
interesting

731.44 --> 733.9200000000001
so watch

737.68 --> 741.68
let me get the exact name

740.639 --> 745.519
so again

741.68 --> 748.8
daddy's home to too apparently with mel

745.519 --> 748.8
gibson in there and

749.279 --> 752.24
that's the only one i the top of the

751.04 --> 754.8
head

752.24 --> 756.72
of my head i remember the name of the

754.8 --> 759.279
actors i'm terrible with actor names

756.72 --> 762.72
overall but like all of the guys in

759.279 --> 762.72
there are like pretty

762.88 --> 766.16
interesting actors

766.32 --> 773.12
and it was really like a family

768.959 --> 776.2399999999999
with complications type of movie but not

773.12 --> 778.32
like dark drama but just funny drama and

776.24 --> 780.72
dude i enjoyed the [ __ ] out of that

778.32 --> 780.72
movie

781.76 --> 787.279
and it like yeah in ways

785.2 --> 790.639
my family

787.279 --> 792.56
had like similar tensions and so i just

790.639 --> 793.92
felt a lot of recognition in all of it

792.56 --> 797.8389999999999
it was just

793.92 --> 799.279
really freaking funny at times

797.839 --> 801.6800000000001
anyway

799.279 --> 804.0
so yeah to me it was kind of a feel-good

801.68 --> 804.0
movie

804.24 --> 807.6
right and no no

806.24 --> 809.44
like

807.6 --> 811.12
yeah there's no darkness in there at all

809.44 --> 812.639
it's like no nobody in there like

811.12 --> 815.04
suddenly dies

812.639 --> 817.6
or something really annoying that would

815.04 --> 819.279
totally ruin it no it's

817.6 --> 820.24
it's a really

819.279 --> 824.32
funny

820.24 --> 826.0
men oriented movie it's all about dads

824.32 --> 829.6
like a guy and

826.0 --> 832.24
two guys and their dads and also like

829.6 --> 834.24
their kids so it's it's a real family

832.24 --> 836.16
movie

834.24 --> 840.24
i really wonder what

836.16 --> 840.24
um benjamin would think about that movie

841.68 --> 848.199
i think he'd appreciate it anyway

844.399 --> 848.199
a seeking star wars

860.399 --> 866.56
you could calculate how many hydrogen

862.56 --> 868.8
molecules are in a glass of water uh

866.56 --> 870.6389999999999
okay so what did he say and how did he

868.8 --> 873.3599999999999
calculate it

870.639 --> 873.36
did you ask

879.6 --> 882.72
it's not going to be easy you know

881.279 --> 885.6
because you're going to have to account

882.72 --> 887.1990000000001
for expansion due to heat and all that

885.6 --> 890.16
and

887.199 --> 894.16
and also go by a convention basically as

890.16 --> 899.399
to how much space does a

894.16 --> 899.399
hydrogen molecule actually take up

899.6 --> 904.8000000000001
you have to first declare a convention

902.32 --> 907.1990000000001
for that because there is no definitive

904.8 --> 908.88
way to really say like okay it is this

907.199 --> 910.8
size right

908.88 --> 913.12
like at best you could say like oh yeah

910.8 --> 915.76
if we make filters with

913.12 --> 916.5600000000001
like molecular holes and

915.76 --> 919.36
yeah

916.56 --> 922.399
whole sizes in them like these this is

919.36 --> 924.72
the size hole through which exactly

922.399 --> 926.959
the gas can still escape but other gas

924.72 --> 930.399
can't right that's how they kind of

926.959 --> 932.7199999999999
determine things mechanically

930.399 --> 934.959
but that doesn't automatically mean that

932.72 --> 937.6800000000001
that's the size of molecule that's just

934.959 --> 939.5189999999999
like the condition

937.68 --> 942.16
in which

939.519 --> 942.9590000000001
the results flow like that

942.16 --> 945.92
it's

942.959 --> 945.92
yeah anyway

949.92 --> 954.279
it proved the globe what

962.32 --> 964.72
okay

966.56 --> 969.56
ah

970.399 --> 975.519
oh poison in your mind yeah well hey

973.12 --> 976.48
don't wonder sometimes there's movies

975.519 --> 977.92
that

976.48 --> 980.24
aren't

977.92 --> 984.3199999999999
surprisingly aren't that bad

980.24 --> 984.32
did you watch daddy's home too

984.48 --> 989.6800000000001
did you think it was

986.32 --> 991.12
like dark and anti-dead and

989.68 --> 992.6389999999999
guess what

991.12 --> 995.839
oh

992.639 --> 998.0
it was all white actors

995.839 --> 1000.24
mean i think like one of the

998.0 --> 1003.68
younger daughters was like half asian or

1000.24 --> 1003.6800000000001
something but i'm okay with that

1003.92 --> 1006.079
so

1006.639 --> 1010.0790000000001
it it

1007.839 --> 1012.0790000000001
it was very it was very serious

1010.079 --> 1014.2399999999999
psychologically and

1012.079 --> 1016.2399999999999
it was kind of about feelings of

1014.24 --> 1019.839
different types of men

1016.24 --> 1019.839
i thought it was really interesting

1020.72 --> 1026.079
you don't watch jew media

1023.199 --> 1026.079
okay then

1036.959 --> 1039.919
yeah that guy obviously doesn't know

1038.48 --> 1044.039
what he's talking about hey nathan

1039.919 --> 1044.039
oakley good to see you

1057.52 --> 1061.76
is degenerating harm's culture yeah

1059.679 --> 1063.1200000000001
you're over generalizing a little golden

1061.76 --> 1066.08
wonder

1063.12 --> 1068.799
i asked you a question did you actually

1066.08 --> 1070.72
see that movie

1068.799 --> 1072.48
did you see

1070.72 --> 1075.1200000000001
like a

1072.48 --> 1077.6
you call them again

1075.12 --> 1080.9599999999998
an ad clip

1077.6 --> 1083.6
a trailer did you see a trailer like

1080.96 --> 1085.2
why don't you take a look and see how

1083.6 --> 1090.12
terribly

1085.2 --> 1090.1200000000001
new world order programming it is

1102.08 --> 1106.559
golden wonder is anti-fun

1104.32 --> 1109.9189999999999
i guess so aries 106.

1106.559 --> 1111.76
have you guys checked it out

1109.919 --> 1115.6000000000001
because i really think that

1111.76 --> 1115.6
a lot of you guys would appreciate it

1116.48 --> 1122.24
i mean i i really get the feeling this

1118.48 --> 1126.96
movie was made with great care

1122.24 --> 1126.96
and all the actors really were into it

1130.559 --> 1136.799
there's all kinds of different like male

1132.799 --> 1138.16
type characteristics that oh

1136.799 --> 1140.24
that pop wow

1138.16 --> 1141.919
nathan

1140.24 --> 1144.72
thank you

1141.919 --> 1146.16
i'll check it out

1144.72 --> 1149.1200000000001
are you doing like

1146.16 --> 1151.3600000000001
how's the projector situation going i

1149.12 --> 1154.3999999999999
mean i hope you

1151.36 --> 1155.84
can afford it but yes you've

1154.4 --> 1158.4
yes

1155.84 --> 1162.0
okay for today at least you're absolved

1158.4 --> 1162.0
from being gay that's good

1163.2 --> 1165.8400000000001
thank you very much

1174.96 --> 1179.039
not very much hey but little bits do

1177.28 --> 1182.16
help actually it's funny that you're

1179.039 --> 1182.16
bringing that up because

1182.559 --> 1185.76
yeah yesterday

1184.88 --> 1187.44
i

1185.76 --> 1192.6
kind of like

1187.44 --> 1192.6000000000001
noticed that i'm on the edge of broke

1193.12 --> 1197.039
and that

1194.88 --> 1199.679
oddly even resulted in that i didn't

1197.039 --> 1200.96
really have full

1199.679 --> 1202.5590000000002
food

1200.96 --> 1204.559
accommodations

1202.559 --> 1207.84
so i ate less yesterday but i'm still

1204.559 --> 1207.84
holding out

1209.039 --> 1213.2
so yeah i could absolutely use the

1211.039 --> 1215.84
support right it is the time of the

1213.2 --> 1217.2
month the support has been great

1215.84 --> 1220.1589999999999
i've not like

1217.2 --> 1222.0
like oh i got it support so let's spend

1220.159 --> 1224.96
it all no although i did like for

1222.0 --> 1226.96
example had to get

1224.96 --> 1231.28
a pair of pants fixed

1226.96 --> 1231.28
i'm gonna collect it today later

1231.679 --> 1235.8400000000001
because it was more holes than pants

1236.96 --> 1240.799
solution is uh and then what

1241.039 --> 1246.08
so we could be like you golden wonder

1243.919 --> 1247.919
and just complain and squirt over

1246.08 --> 1251.12
everything and

1247.919 --> 1251.1200000000001
over blow things

1251.44 --> 1254.0800000000002
no thanks

1258.64 --> 1265.2800000000002
no idea how it's going with my projector

1261.84 --> 1265.28
to scare that really

1267.44 --> 1269.76
all right

1270.24 --> 1273.52
i mean it's been in the shop for a long

1272.32 --> 1276.08
time then

1273.52 --> 1278.799
i wonder what's taking him so long were

1276.08 --> 1281.36
they like all packed with work so it's

1278.799 --> 1283.679
like on the conveyor belt

1281.36 --> 1286.6399999999999
on their to-do list that is taking so

1283.679 --> 1286.64
long or is it like

1288.72 --> 1294.32
a really complicated operation

1291.52 --> 1294.32
what's going on

1301.679 --> 1305.8400000000001
only two weeks well okay

1314.64 --> 1319.76
okay well hey go wonder good for you

1317.12 --> 1321.6789999999999
yeah don't watch it don't watch anything

1319.76 --> 1324.96
just be afraid

1321.679 --> 1327.2
imagine instead how all of it is just

1324.96 --> 1329.3600000000001
pure evil and there's no fun there's

1327.2 --> 1331.1200000000001
nothing to learn there's no fun it's all

1329.36 --> 1333.36
just dark

1331.12 --> 1335.039
right just

1333.36 --> 1337.12
go and

1335.039 --> 1340.559
sit in the corner and and do nothing

1337.12 --> 1342.799
because it's also scary

1340.559 --> 1342.799
right

1345.28 --> 1352.12
if that's your solution then you do

1348.799 --> 1352.12
do that

1360.48 --> 1365.2
okay

1362.48 --> 1368.799
all righty then

1365.2 --> 1368.799
oh talking about witch

1369.28 --> 1375.72
talking about islam

1371.76 --> 1375.72
i noticed this article

1375.84 --> 1378.9599999999998
on rt today

1384.24 --> 1388.919
what do you have to say about that

1385.6 --> 1388.9189999999999
golden wonder

1397.039 --> 1404.799
maybe system is supported by propaganda

1400.64 --> 1404.7990000000002
no no you got the order all wrong

1405.52 --> 1411.84
no the propaganda

1408.48 --> 1414.799
mind controls people that are weak

1411.84 --> 1418.1589999999999
that don't see what's going on

1414.799 --> 1422.48
into supporting the beast system that's

1418.159 --> 1422.48
the natural order of how this happens

1424.159 --> 1427.6000000000001
the propaganda in itself doesn't really

1426.4 --> 1429.52
do anything

1427.6 --> 1433.12
right and you can't even watch it and if

1429.52 --> 1435.039
you know how it is propaganda

1433.12 --> 1438.039
then you're not going to support the bee

1435.039 --> 1438.039
system

1454.0 --> 1457.0
ah

1480.0 --> 1485.039
no you agree well dude

1482.08 --> 1485.039
are you a muslim

1485.2 --> 1490.48
or do you consider yourselves

1488.0 --> 1490.48
as one

1490.96 --> 1493.76
maybe you should

1493.919 --> 1498.7990000000002
although yeah

1496.24 --> 1501.279
i think that you do have a lot of like

1498.799 --> 1505.1589999999999
gamma impulses and that's not really

1501.279 --> 1505.159
good when you're muslim

1516.72 --> 1524.0
right the main objective is

1520.4 --> 1528.3600000000001
just don't be afraid right

1524.0 --> 1528.36
don't be so scared of it

1528.48 --> 1535.279
know what it is figure it out

1531.44 --> 1536.88
understand how it works so you can't be

1535.279 --> 1539.36
fooled

1536.88 --> 1543.3200000000002
and then you don't have to just like be

1539.36 --> 1543.32
outraged all the time

1544.32 --> 1548.24
it's more healthy for you you know

1548.32 --> 1552.84
just don't be fooled again

1568.559 --> 1574.0
ah so seeking star wars

1571.44 --> 1577.6000000000001
yeah dude i'm not saying that like their

1574.0 --> 1580.159
entire religious setup is perfect right

1577.6 --> 1582.08
they got their own type of gravels

1580.159 --> 1585.0800000000002
inherent in the system

1582.08 --> 1585.08
but

1585.12 --> 1590.32
yeah in a lot of ways like personal code

1587.919 --> 1592.5590000000002
of conduct yeah

1590.32 --> 1595.2
islam is doing pretty well

1592.559 --> 1597.52
like they have natural it built in

1595.2 --> 1600.0
defenses against

1597.52 --> 1603.44
this sort of psychological

1600.0 --> 1603.44
subversion mind control

1611.279 --> 1616.159
orange fear level until told otherwise

1613.679 --> 1616.159
this is

1616.72 --> 1619.3600000000001
okido

1625.679 --> 1632.799
i don't know i keep it at yellow

1629.279 --> 1635.12
just to make it push you a little

1632.799 --> 1639.8799999999999
but not enough to cloud your judgment

1635.12 --> 1639.8799999999999
that's where i where i'd keep it

1648.64 --> 1654.76
huh

1650.96 --> 1654.76
all right golden wonder

1667.23 --> 1670.299
[Music]

1701.36 --> 1707.84
right i don't know how it rolled into

1703.76 --> 1709.039
this all of a sudden that's weird

1707.84 --> 1712.8799999999999
all right

1709.039 --> 1712.8799999999999
i wasn't gonna make it like an item

1713.36 --> 1719.7199999999998
but yeah i just noticed that article and

1716.159 --> 1719.72
thought like huh

1724.799 --> 1728.6399999999999
because yeah a lot of people have

1726.799 --> 1730.6399999999999
already been very suspicious about

1728.64 --> 1733.679
cryptocurrency

1730.64 --> 1735.919
and i thought it was just like hey

1733.679 --> 1735.919
well

1737.84 --> 1742.559
those people are apparently the only

1740.159 --> 1743.5200000000002
ones

1742.559 --> 1744.72
so

1743.52 --> 1747.36
that's all

1744.72 --> 1751.64
you know didn't want to get into like

1747.36 --> 1751.6399999999999
muslim religion islam

1756.08 --> 1762.52
i a s

1757.76 --> 1762.52
m r with the t what

1774.159 --> 1777.5200000000002
i'm i don't know what that stands for

1776.159 --> 1778.7990000000002
ilg

1777.52 --> 1781.76
anyway

1778.799 --> 1785.8799999999999
uh

1781.76 --> 1785.8799999999999
what was i gonna talk about

1799.6 --> 1803.039
oh

1801.44 --> 1804.799
i don't think i remember it's weird

1803.039 --> 1807.2
though but

1804.799 --> 1809.6
yeah so yesterday

1807.2 --> 1811.52
i didn't really have money for full food

1809.6 --> 1813.279
accommodations that have gotten kind of

1811.52 --> 1815.52
used to

1813.279 --> 1817.76
and i also noticed and that's kind of

1815.52 --> 1818.559
embarrassing that

1817.76 --> 1821.039
like

1818.559 --> 1823.84
my eggs are like over date and i don't

1821.039 --> 1825.679
know i should still check them like are

1823.84 --> 1829.36
they really

1825.679 --> 1830.799
because they're like really high quality

1829.36 --> 1832.08
still store

1830.799 --> 1833.76
handled

1832.08 --> 1836.96
eggs

1833.76 --> 1839.919
organic free range like pretty much the

1836.96 --> 1842.08
max in a demeter setting

1839.919 --> 1842.0800000000002
so

1843.679 --> 1846.96
but they're like

1845.12 --> 1848.0
i think like two weeks over date or

1846.96 --> 1849.039
something

1848.0 --> 1850.799
so

1849.039 --> 1854.399
i didn't want to risk

1850.799 --> 1857.36
like eating that just yet

1854.399 --> 1860.799
so i later that evening i

1857.36 --> 1863.12
was like okay what am i gonna eat

1860.799 --> 1865.9189999999999
i had french fries but that's not enough

1863.12 --> 1868.1589999999999
for like the entire day

1865.919 --> 1871.039
so i took

1868.159 --> 1872.7990000000002
like a noodles

1871.039 --> 1875.12
and then

1872.799 --> 1877.2
took some bottle that was literally

1875.12 --> 1879.1999999999998
lying in my fridge forever

1877.2 --> 1882.519
i checked the exploration date and it

1879.2 --> 1882.519
was 2017

1882.799 --> 1886.24
really

1884.08 --> 1888.32
but it that didn't have any meat

1886.24 --> 1891.519
components or milk based components it

1888.32 --> 1893.36
was mostly like sort of chili sauce

1891.519 --> 1895.76
and i used that

1893.36 --> 1898.32
but i was thinking like oh [ __ ] i hope

1895.76 --> 1899.919
i'm not gonna get sick

1898.32 --> 1902.72
but it didn't

1899.919 --> 1904.96
and it kind of surprised me

1902.72 --> 1907.76
that it didn't

1904.96 --> 1910.0
so that happened

1907.76 --> 1910.0
right

1912.0 --> 1915.84
eggs don't go bad

1913.76 --> 1918.08
well it depends though look these are

1915.84 --> 1920.799
not the eggs have kind of been washed

1918.08 --> 1921.9189999999999
there's no more chicken [ __ ] all over it

1920.799 --> 1923.12
and then

1921.919 --> 1925.919
they

1923.12 --> 1927.9189999999999
do eventually go bad

1925.919 --> 1930.3200000000002
and they have never checked

1927.919 --> 1932.88
how long it actually takes before these

1930.32 --> 1935.84
acts from this specific farm go bad i

1932.88 --> 1935.8400000000001
haven't done that yet

1936.08 --> 1941.6789999999999
so i'm weary about it

1938.559 --> 1941.6789999999999
but i'm gonna check it

1942.08 --> 1946.399
oh that's a good one put your eggs in

1944.24 --> 1950.3990000000001
water if they float their bed thank you

1946.399 --> 1950.399
for the tip that's a good one yes

1954.399 --> 1960.8799999999999
i remember now yeah i had completely

1956.64 --> 1960.88
forgotten that trick that's right yeah

1961.279 --> 1967.799
thank you thank you for reminding me

1964.559 --> 1967.799
it's awesome

1987.279 --> 1991.919
okay golden wonder it seems like you are

1989.84 --> 1994.32
very muslim then

1991.919 --> 1997.1200000000001
maybe you should just

1994.32 --> 1998.6399999999999
go for it dude

1997.12 --> 2000.399
i mean

1998.64 --> 2004.0800000000002
you seem to be

2000.399 --> 2005.12
very much agreeing

2004.08 --> 2009.12
islam

2005.12 --> 2010.799
if that's really your opinion then maybe

2009.12 --> 2012.6399999999999
maybe that crowd is actually would be

2010.799 --> 2015.44
kind of good for you to hang around with

2012.64 --> 2017.6000000000001
it it would be better than just

2015.44 --> 2019.519
roaming chat rooms and

2017.6 --> 2022.799
acting outraged all the time because

2019.519 --> 2022.799
that's not very productive

2031.679 --> 2039.24
yeah yeah nathan sure you are

2034.72 --> 2039.24
and you're a black woman i know

2085.44 --> 2089.399
doesn't stand up

2090.879 --> 2095.359
what how does it even look when an egg

2092.8 --> 2098.0
yolk doesn't stand up

2095.359 --> 2100.72
you mean like if the yolk has kind of

2098.0 --> 2102.8
like is turned too gooey that it just

2100.72 --> 2106.1189999999997
immediately liquefies what does that

2102.8 --> 2106.119
even mean

2124.4 --> 2131.839
believe return to theocracy what

2129.04 --> 2131.839
uh

2132.64 --> 2138.24
theocracy is not christian

2135.52 --> 2138.24
golden wonder

2141.68 --> 2144.56
theocracy is

2143.28 --> 2147.6800000000003
priesthood

2144.56 --> 2147.68
power structure

2148.48 --> 2152.28
that's not christian

2172.96 --> 2177.2
i mean

2174.24 --> 2182.16
did you ever hear jesus

2177.2 --> 2182.16
talk about the blessings of theocracy

2182.72 --> 2186.2799999999997
and basically

2186.4 --> 2189.6800000000003
the laws be

2187.839 --> 2191.359
of christ of

2189.68 --> 2192.8799999999997
did he even now he didn't even get

2191.359 --> 2196.72
closer it was all about the inner

2192.88 --> 2196.7200000000003
journey and avoiding

2197.359 --> 2204.16
also all that sort of thing tyranny

2200.48 --> 2206.4
because theocracy is tyranny

2204.16 --> 2210.839
it's taking away people's choice and

2206.4 --> 2210.839
like forcing them to do things

2217.52 --> 2219.839
right

2223.2 --> 2226.96
it's like another form of kingdom

2225.839 --> 2228.48
or

2226.96 --> 2232.16
empire

2228.48 --> 2234.32
yeah the one if it's ruled by really

2232.16 --> 2237.5989999999997
good priests that are like

2234.32 --> 2239.2000000000003
give up everything to do it perfect to

2237.599 --> 2240.96
really honor

2239.2 --> 2244.0
christ's teachings and all that yeah

2240.96 --> 2245.04
then potentially it could be great for a

2244.0 --> 2246.8
while

2245.04 --> 2249.2
until the grapplers get in like they

2246.8 --> 2251.76
always do and then it turns into a giant

2249.2 --> 2251.7599999999998
nightmare

2252.8 --> 2256.6800000000003
like what happened

2262.72 --> 2267.64
religious courts what the [ __ ]

2270.88 --> 2273.359
i just

2274.079 --> 2278.2400000000002
okay that that's a little much dude i

2281.04 --> 2285.839
that sounds kind of crazy

2283.359 --> 2285.839
really

2298.4 --> 2303.2000000000003
yeah okay but golden wonder look you're

2301.04 --> 2304.64
you don't understand what you're saying

2303.2 --> 2305.7599999999998
effectively

2304.64 --> 2309.1189999999997
again

2305.76 --> 2309.92
so yeah what if there is this

2309.119 --> 2312.4
oh

2309.92 --> 2314.2400000000002
like priest police

2312.4 --> 2317.92
that are gonna enforce that sort of

2314.24 --> 2320.4799999999996
thing so what happens

2317.92 --> 2322.56
they set the tone this is the way we do

2320.48 --> 2324.0
things this is the level

2322.56 --> 2325.92
we do things yeah that gives some

2324.0 --> 2328.48
stability perhaps people are gonna

2325.92 --> 2330.88
refrain from doing that because the

2328.48 --> 2333.599
punishment is severe

2330.88 --> 2337.119
and then

2333.599 --> 2339.599
that priesthood corrupts

2337.119 --> 2342.32
and now they're on that level and then

2339.599 --> 2345.839
they might just change things

2342.32 --> 2347.52
and then if they get brutal on political

2345.839 --> 2350.72
opponents

2347.52 --> 2352.72
nobody's going to be like oh

2350.72 --> 2355.1189999999997
oh no what are they doing because

2352.72 --> 2356.7999999999997
they're used to that punishment [ __ ] now

2355.119 --> 2358.8
they might not even pick up on what's

2356.8 --> 2362.4
happening

2358.8 --> 2362.4
dude you have no idea

2362.8 --> 2367.4
the consequences of what you're implying

2370.96 --> 2374.56
iran is a theocracy

2375.68 --> 2379.3199999999997
yeah but

2380.13 --> 2383.219
[Music]

2393.119 --> 2399.119
what i'm basically saying is that like

2395.599 --> 2401.44
that's not gonna work on the west

2399.119 --> 2403.119
like iran's been like that

2401.44 --> 2405.2000000000003
and like even before it was called

2403.119 --> 2409.28
around for for a while

2405.2 --> 2411.2
like that's always been part of how they

2409.28 --> 2413.28
were set up

2411.2 --> 2418.24
for a long time

2413.28 --> 2418.2400000000002
that's not how we've set things up here

2419.68 --> 2422.68
hey

2425.359 --> 2429.52
yeah okay yeah okay now it's just

2427.599 --> 2432.88
getting disgusting

2429.52 --> 2432.88
wonder like are you really

2433.839 --> 2438.56
are you really just like oh yeah man all

2436.48 --> 2441.359
the way all the damage

2438.56 --> 2444.0
everything what the [ __ ]

2441.359 --> 2446.16
i mean like okay when own benjamin sort

2444.0 --> 2448.96
of does it as a joke

2446.16 --> 2451.5989999999997
trigger people i get it but you're like

2448.96 --> 2454.079
seriously arguing for it now that's kind

2451.599 --> 2454.079
of sick

2454.56 --> 2460.4
that's not a good thing

2457.68 --> 2460.3999999999996
i don't i mean

2461.119 --> 2465.52
hanging up rainbow flags everywhere and

2463.44 --> 2467.52
just legalizing porn and all that yeah

2465.52 --> 2469.44
that's not good

2467.52 --> 2470.24
but

2469.44 --> 2472.48
to

2470.24 --> 2474.4799999999996
want it to go to the level where

2472.48 --> 2479.64
basically

2474.48 --> 2479.64
people get beaten in the street dude

2480.4 --> 2485.2000000000003
it's just trolling us well i think so

2482.4 --> 2487.599
too actually at this point

2485.2 --> 2489.5989999999997
yeah dude

2487.599 --> 2490.319
tone it down or i'm gonna ban you this

2489.599 --> 2492.079
is

2490.319 --> 2495.48
literally sickening me

2492.079 --> 2495.48
stop it

2496.4 --> 2500.04
this is not funny

2512.24 --> 2516.4799999999996
oh man look at this gold wonder

2515.2 --> 2520.0
can't wait

2516.48 --> 2522.56
long's he's literally declaring

2520.0 --> 2526.64
he's longing for the days when

2522.56 --> 2526.64
christians stoned people

2528.0 --> 2530.24
uh

2533.839 --> 2538.16
don't even know if that is even

2535.68 --> 2542.0
technically correct

2538.16 --> 2543.44
that that literally happened like that

2542.0 --> 2545.92
so long ago

2543.44 --> 2549.04
if yeah were those even christians or

2545.92 --> 2549.04
were those just like

2549.2 --> 2551.839
i don't know

2552.64 --> 2556.319
but yeah your uh

2556.4 --> 2561.4
your points kind of insane golden wonder

2573.44 --> 2577.28
hello jeff gas head by the way

2575.92 --> 2579.839
kind of want to move on from this

2577.28 --> 2579.8390000000004
subject

2593.2 --> 2598.96
and it becomes christian

2595.68 --> 2598.96
well you can't force it

2603.2 --> 2606.5989999999997
it's a choice

2607.04 --> 2614.88
and hey if that choice seems appealing

2610.64 --> 2614.8799999999997
then people will try to do that too

2614.96 --> 2617.359
it's

2615.76 --> 2619.3590000000004
a message you've fought you've walked

2617.359 --> 2622.16
the path you follow the teachings you

2619.359 --> 2624.0789999999997
try to be better you try to recognize

2622.16 --> 2624.8799999999997
bad influences for what they are and

2624.079 --> 2628.079
then

2624.88 --> 2631.839
try to wean yourself off

2628.079 --> 2633.92
and be constructive be productive try to

2631.839 --> 2635.52
recognize that people you might feel are

2633.92 --> 2637.2000000000003
your enemies aren't technically your

2635.52 --> 2639.359
enemies they're more like a challenge

2637.2 --> 2641.68
and you could end up friends

2639.359 --> 2643.2
and at the same time don't take friends

2641.68 --> 2644.72
for granted because if you're not

2643.2 --> 2647.68
careful they could turn into your

2644.72 --> 2649.7599999999998
enemies etc etc it's just

2647.68 --> 2651.9199999999996
it's just a map

2649.76 --> 2654.079
on how to walk the path

2651.92 --> 2656.7200000000003
you can't force that on society not

2654.079 --> 2660.2400000000002
everybody can find the will to do that

2656.72 --> 2660.24
and you can't force that

2660.64 --> 2667.44
you have no idea like what

2664.16 --> 2669.68
yeah actual christianity is

2667.44 --> 2672.0
in my opinion

2669.68 --> 2674.3999999999996
or at least yeah what you're saying is

2672.0 --> 2676.72
not my christianity

2674.4 --> 2679.76
then again i am an eclectic and i'm an

2676.72 --> 2679.7599999999998
esoteric christian

2684.72 --> 2687.9599999999996
oh cleary

2697.28 --> 2702.2400000000002
choice

2698.8 --> 2706.48
are you dude this guy is a freaking

2702.24 --> 2706.4799999999996
insane fanatic insane

2706.96 --> 2710.319
you think it's christian

2710.4 --> 2714.7200000000003
to say that choice

2712.8 --> 2717.3590000000004
is the problem that caused the

2714.72 --> 2718.3999999999996
degenerate society

2717.359 --> 2720.96
so

2718.4 --> 2723.119
like the key component of god's design

2720.96 --> 2725.68
you think it's bad

2723.119 --> 2727.76
that's the problem the problem is choice

2725.68 --> 2729.2
let's take away the choice

2727.76 --> 2730.88
you think that

2729.2 --> 2733.839
christ

2730.88 --> 2733.839
would agree with that

2734.88 --> 2738.92
you're out of your mind man

2752.8 --> 2755.8
so

2767.52 --> 2771.64

2797.44 --> 2804.0
that before

2800.0 --> 2806.4
it's displaying to social instinct

2804.0 --> 2809.2
using sound effects to kind of stimulate

2806.4 --> 2813.2400000000002
you on a social level weird by the way

2809.2 --> 2813.24

2955.28 --> 2957.8390000000004
gonna kill you

2958.0 --> 2963.2
oh yeah yeah oh i'm so sorry uh

2961.52 --> 2966.24
what is it again

2963.2 --> 2969.2
oh yeah jesus died for our sins so we

2966.24 --> 2971.52
can squirt it's no problem and

2969.2 --> 2973.2
oh yeah and he is his father and the

2971.52 --> 2975.2
holy ghost

2973.2 --> 2977.5989999999997
and he he talks to his father in the

2975.2 --> 2980.72
bible and he mentions him as a separate

2977.599 --> 2983.3590000000004
person and or as a separate entity

2980.72 --> 2986.7999999999997
but he's all the same and he's god and

2983.359 --> 2989.2
he killed his only son which he is and

2986.8 --> 2992.2400000000002
yes yes yes please let me live

2989.2 --> 2992.24
is it going to be like that

2995.68 --> 2999.839
that's a very scary prospect dude

3008.079 --> 3013.8390000000004
pauline christianity

3011.28 --> 3013.8390000000004
what

3020.16 --> 3024.52
hello by the way pg chris shank

3026.0 --> 3033.48
[ __ ] should be reported

3029.52 --> 3033.48
i think he's just a sock

3046.96 --> 3051.359
i think that whoever that was is just a

3049.359 --> 3054.0
squirting youngster

3051.359 --> 3058.0789999999997
he's just getting really extremist it

3054.0 --> 3058.079
could be like 14 years old or something

3058.319 --> 3061.2
i mean i

3059.68 --> 3063.839
when i was like

3061.2 --> 3066.96
much younger i talked like that too

3063.839 --> 3068.88
because i just had no oversight no real

3066.96 --> 3070.4
grip

3068.88 --> 3073.04
so i would just

3070.4 --> 3074.96
take it to the ultimate steps like

3073.04 --> 3076.64
always end up just like yeah it

3074.96 --> 3078.7200000000003
basically comes down to we have to kill

3076.64 --> 3079.92
them all like yeah that's what freaking

3078.72 --> 3084.24
happens

3079.92 --> 3084.2400000000002
if you have no idea of balance

3088.079 --> 3092.96
it effectively just makes you

3090.64 --> 3094.96
push yourself mentally to be on the

3092.96 --> 3097.04
winning side

3094.96 --> 3098.4
it's not

3097.04 --> 3101.359
virtuous

3098.4 --> 3104.0
or godly in any sense

3101.359 --> 3107.04
it's just power

3104.0 --> 3107.04
it's a call of power

3109.04 --> 3115.7599999999998
how is fluttered [ __ ] doing he's dead

3112.64 --> 3118.0

week

3120.559 --> 3125.8390000000004

3263.04 --> 3267.319
you're absorbed of being gay

3284.16 --> 3288.359
what in the world is happening

3321.2 --> 3326.7599999999998
what was focus channel called flat earth

3323.76 --> 3326.76
folker

3337.92 --> 3342.44
i think i'm still subscribed to him

3364.64 --> 3370.24
i should be

3366.559 --> 3370.2400000000002
where's his channel now gone too

3372.16 --> 3375.16
well

3376.319 --> 3379.2
not finding it

3389.68 --> 3391.9199999999996
hmm

3392.0 --> 3396.24
or maybe i wasn't subscribed

3395.119 --> 3398.4
weird

3396.24 --> 3400.3999999999996
i wasn't really following you sometimes

3398.4 --> 3401.76
like i just noticed that he was doing a

3400.4 --> 3403.44
live stream in the youtube

3401.76 --> 3405.28
recommendations and then i'd go there

3403.44 --> 3407.68
but

3405.28 --> 3407.6800000000003
whatever

3409.76 --> 3416.44
all right pj cruise jack yeah thanks for

3411.44 --> 3416.44
popping by and the paypal that's awesome

3422.0 --> 3425.48
have a good day

3440.24 --> 3444.4799999999996
oh right gadget inspector if you called

3442.16 --> 3447.1189999999997
somebody fat years ago either you made

3444.48 --> 3451.04
and cry or yeah yeah people would be

3447.119 --> 3451.04
hurt now they're just desensitized

3451.119 --> 3455.92
because it's just internet talk and hey

3453.599 --> 3455.92
i'm

3456.079 --> 3459.44
i've even described that like

3458.079 --> 3461.8390000000004
two years ago

3459.44 --> 3464.7200000000003
like what it's like like

3461.839 --> 3467.68
i get a lot more forward especially when

3464.72 --> 3471.9199999999996
my emotions get involved on the internet

3467.68 --> 3471.9199999999996
as when i would be face to face because

3473.44 --> 3478.16
because it's just too intense face to

3475.44 --> 3481.359
face it'll like really be disturbing

3478.16 --> 3483.359
so i would never do that

3481.359 --> 3485.839
and a lot of people experience that it's

3483.359 --> 3486.5589999999997
just like no you you can throw out more

3485.839 --> 3489.839
and

3486.559 --> 3491.52
it's doable it becomes more like an

3489.839 --> 3493.2799999999997
active expression

3491.52 --> 3495.68
but yeah on the other hand if you get

3493.28 --> 3498.4
addicted to that then you start to gamma

3495.68 --> 3500.64
spazz out and a lot of people do that

3498.4 --> 3501.839
too when you think like oh oh if i'm

3500.64 --> 3504.4
going

3501.839 --> 3507.2
go if i'm gonna break open that door i'm

3504.4 --> 3509.92
just gonna throw every piece of garbage

3507.2 --> 3513.1189999999997
that i can pick up on in there as well

3509.92 --> 3515.599
and just get super [ __ ] up

3513.119 --> 3518.6400000000003
just unnecessarily destroy everything

3515.599 --> 3520.1600000000003
yeah gamma is spazzing out

3518.64 --> 3522.64
that happens too it's just because

3520.16 --> 3524.799
people have no self-control

3522.64 --> 3526.96
and then when suddenly

3524.799 --> 3529.2
that protection barrier that

3526.96 --> 3531.44
prevents them from

3529.2 --> 3533.2
snapping out is out of the way and they

3531.44 --> 3537.76
get on the internet then suddenly they

3533.2 --> 3541.0
throw all that [ __ ] all over the place

3537.76 --> 3541.0
it's psychological

3554.96 --> 3559.799
oh can't you specta that's creepy

3573.839 --> 3579.2799999999997
no channel what the enchant what his

3576.559 --> 3582.28
channels gone

3579.28 --> 3582.28
what

3593.839 --> 3596.799
damn that's quick

3597.839 --> 3602.0789999999997
i mean i know that facebook typically

3600.16 --> 3604.5589999999997
really deletes

3602.079 --> 3607.28
channels of dead people really quickly a

3604.559 --> 3609.119
lot of the times although because it was

3607.28 --> 3610.48
a whole item

3609.119 --> 3612.88
right there were

3610.48 --> 3615.119
like there was even like

3612.88 --> 3616.2400000000002
reports in the netherlands about how

3615.119 --> 3618.1600000000003
that worked

3616.24 --> 3620.64
sometimes somebody dies and like in

3618.16 --> 3623.7599999999998
school an accident

3620.64 --> 3625.839
and then they leave the page up and then

3623.76 --> 3628.6400000000003
a lot of people like

3625.839 --> 3630.319
visited almost like a shrine

3628.64 --> 3632.0789999999997
to pay their respects but then at the

3630.319 --> 3634.64
same time there's like gammas around the

3632.079 --> 3635.76
corner that are like gonna [ __ ] all over

3634.64 --> 3637.2
it

3635.76 --> 3640.48
i think

3637.2 --> 3640.48
that that was part of like

3641.04 --> 3644.799
social push

3643.119 --> 3646.319
to

3644.799 --> 3649.7599999999998
make

3646.319 --> 3652.5589999999997
or make agreement to that facebook takes

3649.76 --> 3654.1600000000003
down pages really quickly when somebody

3652.559 --> 3656.1600000000003
dies

3654.16 --> 3659.04
like when the account holder dies they

3656.16 --> 3660.48
take it down quickly

3659.04 --> 3661.2799999999997
which is

3660.48 --> 3664.4
well

3661.28 --> 3667.76
effectively just removing all their

3664.4 --> 3667.76
contribution as well

3669.04 --> 3673.7599999999998
depends on on the channel right if it's

3671.04 --> 3674.5589999999997
just some person communicating through

3673.76 --> 3677.2000000000003
it

3674.559 --> 3678.96
or whether they actually have media

3677.2 --> 3682.16
activities and

3678.96 --> 3682.16
video productions

3682.839 --> 3687.599
anyway but if yeah

3686.48 --> 3690.079
if his

3687.599 --> 3692.48
facebook account is taken down i'm not

3690.079 --> 3693.8390000000004
surprised youtube account is different

3692.48 --> 3695.68
though

3693.839 --> 3698.0
i haven't seen youtube doing it like

3695.68 --> 3699.9199999999996
that like oh you die and immediately the

3698.0 --> 3701.28
channels deleted now i haven't seen that

3699.92 --> 3703.52
happen

3701.28 --> 3707.28
i mean they delete your channel just

3703.52 --> 3709.44
because of political reasons sometimes

3707.28 --> 3712.76
when you're still alive so

3709.44 --> 3712.76
but anyway

3713.119 --> 3717.599
he's never taken my friend's page down

3715.92 --> 3720.7200000000003
that i

3717.599 --> 3720.7200000000003
asked to remove okay

3721.039 --> 3726.119
they said only the owner of it again

3726.319 --> 3728.72
odd

3738.0 --> 3742.88
anyway i don't dude i i don't go to

3740.799 --> 3744.64
facebook i don't use it

3742.88 --> 3745.76
only thing that i know about is what i

3744.64 --> 3747.5989999999997
pick up

3745.76 --> 3751.2000000000003
at a distance

3747.599 --> 3751.2000000000003
and through other people

3753.119 --> 3758.4
i never watch facebook videos i never go

3756.16 --> 3758.3999999999996
there

3759.52 --> 3764.4
i mean sometimes

3762.0 --> 3767.119
pages might have like

3764.4 --> 3769.92
implemented facebook things and then i

3767.119 --> 3772.1600000000003
can see that or i can watch that

3769.92 --> 3774.2400000000002
but if i'd have you can't go to facebook

3772.16 --> 3775.1189999999997
without having a facebook account and i

3774.24 --> 3776.8799999999997
don't

3775.119 --> 3780.079
want one

3776.88 --> 3782.48
i learned my lesson from south park

3780.079 --> 3783.92
and by the way way before south park

3782.48 --> 3786.989
even

3783.92 --> 3786.989
[Music]

3791.68 --> 3797.0
austelli in 80 12.

3793.599 --> 3797.0
i'm doing great

3810.799 --> 3813.799
huh

3829.039 --> 3831.5200000000004
anyway

3835.68 --> 3839.839
right be back two minutes

3858.24 --> 3861.24
so

3928.64 --> 3931.64
um

3949.119 --> 3954.96
all that never had a facebook account

3951.68 --> 3956.5589999999997
all that do have the gay

3954.96 --> 3959.559
indeed clutch

3956.559 --> 3959.559
indeed

3973.119 --> 3978.0
should be banned

3976.0 --> 3980.96
uh

3978.0 --> 3980.96
should it be man

3983.52 --> 3987.599
i don't know about that part

3986.24 --> 3989.839
but

3987.599 --> 3992.48
i think they just should be out competed

3989.839 --> 3996.0789999999997
if that's even possible right they

3992.48 --> 3996.079
shouldn't have some monopoly

3996.4 --> 4000.48
and they definitely should not be some

3998.559 --> 4003.2000000000003
kind of a standard

4000.48 --> 4005.28
because of their terrible terrible

4003.2 --> 4007.2
censorship and social engineering

4005.28 --> 4010.559
policies which they're freaking open

4007.2 --> 4010.5589999999997
about it's terrible

4014.88 --> 4019.44
like they

4015.839 --> 4022.16
they openly social engineer

4019.44 --> 4022.16
their flock

4023.92 --> 4030.16
i wouldn't want that

4026.4 --> 4032.48
to be standardized it's terrible

4030.16 --> 4035.839
it's not what social media is for it's a

4032.48 --> 4035.839
communication platform

4054.88 --> 4060.2400000000002
censorship

4056.96 --> 4060.2400000000002
is the arch enemy of

4060.839 --> 4064.92
communication um

4093.359 --> 4096.68

now it could still be no but you see you

4298.64 --> 4304.2390000000005
don't understand how how the trans thing

4301.6 --> 4306.56
can work you could still call it peter

4304.239 --> 4307.759999999999
but it's just a girl

4306.56 --> 4309.4400000000005
right

4307.76 --> 4312.320000000001
what you can't

4309.44 --> 4315.719
be a girl with a man's name that sounds

4312.32 --> 4315.719
very sexist

4315.76 --> 4318.08
you know

4324.48 --> 4329.04
petra tread uh yeah this is getting

4326.64 --> 4333.1990000000005
really gross

4329.04 --> 4333.199
anyway it was just a crazy idea

4334.87 --> 4337.92
[Music]

4338.88 --> 4342.719
right because you know everybody would

4340.719 --> 4344.88
get way more triggered if it was just

4342.719 --> 4346.56
the peter pan movie and everybody's a

4344.88 --> 4348.62
girl but they still have

4346.56 --> 4350.0
their boy names

4348.62 --> 4353.92
[Music]

4350.0 --> 4356.96
you know that's gonna trigger everybody

4353.92 --> 4359.28
they seem to want to do that [ __ ] so

4356.96 --> 4362.159
yeah who knows maybe that's actually

4359.28 --> 4362.159
gonna happen now

4362.32 --> 4365.799999999999
oh god

4373.6 --> 4379.320000000001
what steamy traveler are you you're

4375.84 --> 4379.32
joking right

4395.04 --> 4400.159
oh [ __ ] no joking damn all right

4398.719 --> 4402.2390000000005
hey eric

4400.159 --> 4405.28
one one one one

4402.239 --> 4408.639999999999
yeah you just rolled in a weird

4405.28 --> 4408.639999999999
weird part of this show

4409.6 --> 4413.92
i was

4410.84 --> 4416.4800000000005
imagining based on sandy hook it's

4413.92 --> 4418.0
really stupid joke but then i conjured

4416.48 --> 4420.5599999999995
forth some

4418.0 --> 4423.52
crazy

4420.56 --> 4425.360000000001
woke new peter pan remake

4423.52 --> 4427.679
where everybody's a girl but they still

4425.36 --> 4431.199
just have the boys names but they're all

4427.679 --> 4431.1990000000005
played by women and girls

4435.679 --> 4439.679
and

4437.52 --> 4442.4800000000005
the idea of it is so terrible they might

4439.679 --> 4442.4800000000005
actually do it

4450.0 --> 4455.84
it would be kind of like peter pan the

4452.48 --> 4455.839999999999
lesbian edition

4462.32 --> 4465.5199999999995
oh god

4464.0 --> 4468.4
there might be

4465.52 --> 4470.400000000001
no i'm not even gonna say it

4468.4 --> 4472.0
but you know the internet rule there

4470.4 --> 4474.639999999999
might already be

4472.0 --> 4477.04
a certain thing

4474.64 --> 4479.6
with that setup out there i wouldn't be

4477.04 --> 4479.6
surprised

4480.08 --> 4483.08
uh

4504.239 --> 4507.239
ah

4514.56 --> 4520.64
all right but i want to try to kind of

4516.159 --> 4520.639999999999
keep it family friendly so let's not

4521.28 --> 4527.12
make this any worse

4523.52 --> 4527.120000000001
peter pan goes to the moon

4531.44 --> 4534.159
but

4532.88 --> 4536.159000000001
no

4534.159 --> 4538.4
no that doesn't work gadget inspector

4536.159 --> 4540.639999999999
the moon doesn't exist in the same realm

4538.4 --> 4542.799999999999
you do realize like they go to another

4540.64 --> 4543.679
dimension pretty much

4542.8 --> 4546.159000000001
right

4543.679 --> 4548.64
they literally plane shift

4546.159 --> 4550.32
into that other dimension

4548.64 --> 4553.84
like i've thought about that like it

4550.32 --> 4553.84
could be like a pocket dimension

4554.64 --> 4557.92
that some wizard made

4563.28 --> 4568.639999999999
because the realm

4565.199 --> 4570.32
in peter pan it's not like oh this is so

4568.64 --> 4571.4400000000005
huge

4570.32 --> 4573.84
no

4571.44 --> 4574.96
it's not that big it's much more like a

4573.84 --> 4576.159000000001
micro

4574.96 --> 4578.08
realm

4576.159 --> 4581.04
and that kind of falls in line with the

4578.08 --> 4584.08
mechanics of a pocket dimension

4581.04 --> 4584.08
at least in d

4591.6 --> 4599.120000000001
narnia well narnia is is also a pocket

4594.96 --> 4601.36
dimension but it is fast

4599.12 --> 4604.5599999999995
so if it was a pocket dimension pocket

4601.36 --> 4607.04
dimensions grow in d yeah yeah it's just

4604.56 --> 4609.52
weird mechanical details

4607.04 --> 4611.28
so if narnia was a pocket dimension then

4609.52 --> 4613.52
it's very old

4611.28 --> 4618.44
because it's grown very big

4613.52 --> 4618.4400000000005
basically has like kingdoms in it

4644.64 --> 4650.719
well oh my god dude you just gave me the

4647.6 --> 4654.08
word that's terrible but

4650.719 --> 4656.64
peter pan goes to the moon but oh i feel

4654.08 --> 4660.8
gross for even thinking it

4656.64 --> 4660.8
but they could sort of do it

4661.12 --> 4664.8
remember with hook how like he's grown

4663.76 --> 4666.88
up

4664.8 --> 4668.2390000000005
and then later gets dragged into it

4666.88 --> 4670.4800000000005
again

4668.239 --> 4670.48
well

4670.64 --> 4675.84
what yeah the actor unfortunately passed

4673.52 --> 4677.040000000001
away is a long time ago so he couldn't

4675.84 --> 4678.96
do that

4677.04 --> 4682.159
but yeah maybe it's like oh

4678.96 --> 4684.2390000000005
i used to be peter pan or a like a kid

4682.159 --> 4687.12
that went to

4684.239 --> 4690.5599999999995
never never land with peter pan then i

4687.12 --> 4692.32
grew up and then i became an astronaut

4690.56 --> 4694.8
and then he goes to the moon and then

4692.32 --> 4696.719
during the travel

4694.8 --> 4698.64
like he starts to hallucinate or

4696.719 --> 4700.64
something and peter pan comes to take

4698.64 --> 4701.52
him out of the rocket

4700.64 --> 4703.679
to

4701.52 --> 4705.92
never never land or they like switch

4703.679 --> 4708.0
dimensions and he ends up in never never

4705.92 --> 4710.4800000000005
land with his space shuttle

4708.0 --> 4713.92
and his space suit

4710.48 --> 4713.919999999999
i don't know it's ridiculous

4714.32 --> 4716.96
but yeah

4718.0 --> 4721.48
oh god

4735.52 --> 4740.320000000001
this is what it must feel like to be

4738.0 --> 4744.28
like a think tank for a big corporation

4740.32 --> 4744.28
to think of movie ideas

4748.159 --> 4751.159
oh

4764.96 --> 4768.4
but guys seriously how freaky would it

4766.88 --> 4770.64
be if somewhere in the next few years

4768.4 --> 4775.4
there's actually going to be a new peter

4770.64 --> 4775.400000000001
pan movie and it's all female cast

4776.0 --> 4781.679
i think you'd all be like what the [ __ ]

4778.8 --> 4781.679
and so would i

4782.56 --> 4787.0
oh dear oh dear right here

4809.6 --> 4815.04
hello metal slugs coca teal

4812.88 --> 4817.36
where is manny boat

4815.04 --> 4818.4
manitoba

4817.36 --> 4822.159
where is that

4818.4 --> 4822.159
i have no idea never heard of that name

4827.36 --> 4830.08
inspected

4830.719 --> 4833.719
france

4834.08 --> 4838.8
i know it's very confusing

4836.56 --> 4840.0
it's the one thing i can say perfectly

4838.8 --> 4842.320000000001
in french

4840.0 --> 4844.239
with accent and it really confuses them

4842.32 --> 4845.28
because i really don't speak any other

4844.239 --> 4849.36
french

4845.28 --> 4852.36
but i can say juniper le pas francais

4849.36 --> 4852.36
perfectly

4863.92 --> 4866.92
so

4876.4 --> 4882.5199999999995
manitoba world reno i still don't know

4878.8 --> 4882.52
where that is gorzilla

4903.84 --> 4908.88
west of ontario next province oh okay

4905.92 --> 4908.88
this is in canada

4909.76 --> 4912.92
all right

4923.12 --> 4928.04
i still know that means like very good

4932.48 --> 4937.599999999999
i mean maybe i like if i'd had

4936.0 --> 4940.4
if i could put my heart in i could

4937.6 --> 4943.400000000001
actually just learn french

4940.4 --> 4943.4
but

4944.96 --> 4950.44
i don't know

4946.48 --> 4950.44
maybe someday i will

4961.6 --> 4964.6
what

5010.88 --> 5015.28
it was kind of weird because

5013.12 --> 5016.32
brings me back to like when i was a kid

5015.28 --> 5020.0
in school

5016.32 --> 5020.799999999999
and still had french in class

5020.0 --> 5024.4
like

5020.8 --> 5026.639
the teacher was very frustrated at me

5024.4 --> 5029.5199999999995
because i had a great accent even back

5026.639 --> 5031.36
then i really got like the accent i just

5029.52 --> 5034.080000000001
didn't want to learn i didn't want to

5031.36 --> 5034.08
speak french

5034.239 --> 5039.44
and she got really frustrated over that

5038.159 --> 5040.239
so

5039.44 --> 5043.799999999999
yeah

5040.239 --> 5043.799999999999
female teacher

5062.719 --> 5067.44
what french

5064.239 --> 5070.638999999999
with a dublin accent what is that like

5067.44 --> 5073.678999999999
you speak like brian's logic but brian's

5070.639 --> 5076.8
logic does not have a french accent

5073.679 --> 5076.8
or i mean what

5077.92 --> 5080.88
oh wait

5080.159 --> 5083.44
so

5080.88 --> 5085.84
when you speak french it has a dublin

5083.44 --> 5088.08
accent i have no idea what that would

5085.84 --> 5092.04
sound like and if french people could

5088.08 --> 5092.04
actually understand you

5102.719 --> 5105.719
what

5132.239 --> 5138.44
brian is a dividend exit

5134.8 --> 5138.4400000000005
yeah very much

5151.28 --> 5155.84
ah yes george sanford i've heard about

5153.679 --> 5155.84
that

5156.639 --> 5160.96
it's crazy

5158.96 --> 5162.8
i wonder how much of that is actually

5160.96 --> 5167.199
real or if it's just something they're

5162.8 --> 5170.92
building because that's totally insane

5167.199 --> 5170.919999999999
like really bad

5198.48 --> 5204.239
right yet look

5201.36 --> 5204.239
like hey

5205.36 --> 5209.5199999999995
it's not really applicable but

5207.6 --> 5212.96
yeah just

5209.52 --> 5215.360000000001
taking this car co2 out of the air and

5212.96 --> 5217.52
then not doing anything with it keep it

5215.36 --> 5219.159
depriving everybody of it that's

5217.52 --> 5222.159000000001
terrible

5219.159 --> 5224.638999999999
terrible you have no idea

5222.159 --> 5226.08
how dire the consequences are of that in

5224.639 --> 5228.400000000001
the long run

5226.08 --> 5230.639
especially locally

5228.4 --> 5233.12
like it'll probably literally make just

5230.639 --> 5235.04
plant life die

5233.12 --> 5237.36
it's terrible

5235.04 --> 5238.4
if they actually turn that on a high

5237.36 --> 5241.36
level

5238.4 --> 5242.92
but yeah just gathering co2 and then

5241.36 --> 5246.32
maybe

5242.92 --> 5246.32
redistributing it to

5247.44 --> 5252.48
growers and farmers

5250.0 --> 5256.4
to like really

5252.48 --> 5258.5599999999995
put the co2 in the right spot

5256.4 --> 5260.08
right because the plants need it

5258.56 --> 5262.159000000001
that might be

5260.08 --> 5263.44
a worthwhile thing

5262.159 --> 5266.48
but that's not what they're doing

5263.44 --> 5269.04
they're just apparently according to the

5266.48 --> 5269.04
reports

5270.0 --> 5276.56
just depriving everybody of it

5273.36 --> 5276.5599999999995
storing it somewhere

5278.08 --> 5282.92
insane

5279.28 --> 5282.92
totally insane

5297.6 --> 5299.84
like

5300.96 --> 5305.84
if that just continues to go and go and

5303.6 --> 5308.719
go and go and go and you start to see

5305.84 --> 5310.639
the damage like in say 10 years or

5308.719 --> 5312.719
whenever it's going to be turned on

5310.639 --> 5314.56
if it isn't already you start to see

5312.719 --> 5316.56
that that's like

5314.56 --> 5320.639
a thing that

5316.56 --> 5323.639
is eventually worthy declaring war over

5320.639 --> 5323.639
okay

5326.48 --> 5334.04
because hey guess what the rest of the

5329.36 --> 5334.04
world's actually sharing the air

5350.08 --> 5354.239
yeah yeah there's that

5352.0 --> 5357.36
metal slug cockatril but it's also just

5354.239 --> 5360.08
it it lays the surroundings to waste it

5357.36 --> 5362.0
deprives the plants from that co2

5360.08 --> 5363.44
locally because that's where it's being

5362.0 --> 5368.08
captured

5363.44 --> 5368.08
it's a terrible idea

5370.08 --> 5374.5599999999995
like that's a freaking doomsday device

5372.239 --> 5374.5599999999995
dude

5375.92 --> 5382.96
it's a slow kill doomsday device it's

5378.32 --> 5382.96
the worst it's the worst just

5390.88 --> 5398.719
spraying our skies yeah well yeah

5394.96 --> 5398.719
well personally i'm not against just

5399.84 --> 5406.08
basic weather modification like

5403.04 --> 5408.239
to prevent issues to optimize grow

5406.08 --> 5410.0
seasons all that you know it's it's

5408.239 --> 5411.919999999999
delicate it's difficult

5410.0 --> 5412.88
but i know it's possible i'm not against

5411.92 --> 5415.84
that

5412.88 --> 5418.56
but if you're just gonna like

5415.84 --> 5420.2390000000005
do hostile

5418.56 --> 5422.159000000001
weather modification yeah that's

5420.239 --> 5425.159
terrible should never be used to that

5422.159 --> 5425.159
ever

5440.719 --> 5443.44
right

5441.679 --> 5446.88
well clap ruckus

5443.44 --> 5450.08
what if i told you that that device

5446.88 --> 5452.96
that giant thing sucking out the co2

5450.08 --> 5454.719
over time will actually cause

5452.96 --> 5456.56
the parts of the sahara that have

5454.719 --> 5458.96
greened up

5456.56 --> 5460.4800000000005
in like the last few decades because

5458.96 --> 5462.639
there's some parts there that have just

5460.48 --> 5464.959999999999
greened up

5462.639 --> 5468.56
that it will literally kill off all that

5464.96 --> 5471.44
green up area turn it back into desert

5468.56 --> 5474.159000000001
that's going to be the direct

5471.44 --> 5476.159
measurable consequence of putting that

5474.159 --> 5478.48
thing on on the long run if if it is

5476.159 --> 5481.36
really that heavy

5478.48 --> 5483.199
in how much it captures

5481.36 --> 5484.32
it's literally gonna

5483.199 --> 5485.919999999999
cause

5484.32 --> 5487.44
places on earth

5485.92 --> 5490.4
to revert

5487.44 --> 5494.08
from a green area into a desert

5490.4 --> 5495.599999999999
literally that day that device direct

5494.08 --> 5497.12
consequence

5495.6 --> 5498.639
yeah

5497.12 --> 5502.159
it's

5498.639 --> 5505.76
super evil and destructive

5502.159 --> 5507.839999999999
it's a doomsday device

5505.76 --> 5508.88
it is like

5507.84 --> 5510.4800000000005
in

5508.88 --> 5512.0
highlander 2

5510.48 --> 5514.239
the device

5512.0 --> 5517.199
remember that literally just

5514.239 --> 5518.718999999999
like blots out the entire sky for some

5517.199 --> 5521.919999999999
[ __ ] reason

5518.719 --> 5523.76
that's the level of impact that [ __ ]

5521.92 --> 5527.4400000000005
thing is gonna make on the long run if

5523.76 --> 5527.4400000000005
it is as strong as they say it is

5528.239 --> 5531.44
what do you think of the young world

5529.92 --> 5534.32
greta

5531.44 --> 5537.04
weird it's she she's grown up apparently

5534.32 --> 5538.96
sort of she's like past 18 and

5537.04 --> 5541.04
heard some signs that she might actually

5538.96 --> 5544.639
have

5541.04 --> 5547.04
rebelled for real against her parents

5544.639 --> 5548.719
and against the climate change agenda

5547.04 --> 5549.92
because she figured out it's actually a

5548.719 --> 5552.32
scam

5549.92 --> 5554.159
but those are just rumors to me yet it's

5552.32 --> 5555.759999999999
interesting though if she if she

5554.159 --> 5559.36
actually has

5555.76 --> 5559.360000000001
that makes her kind of interesting

5559.52 --> 5564.080000000001
like i wonder what she would do and how

5561.679 --> 5566.56
far she's gonna get

5564.08 --> 5571.08
and we'll see you know

5566.56 --> 5571.080000000001
you will know them by their actions

5574.0 --> 5578.71
blah blah blah

5575.61 --> 5578.71
[Music]

5583.199 --> 5586.4
wants to see if the bank's not the

5585.04 --> 5589.84
climate

5586.4 --> 5589.839999999999
are you sure about that

5592.4 --> 5598.799999999999
i mean you have to realize that she's

5594.4 --> 5601.28
kind of been put up to it by her parents

5598.8 --> 5603.76
she's been used as a child actor to do

5601.28 --> 5606.159
all that she's grown up now she might

5603.76 --> 5608.2390000000005
have actually wise enough since then you

5606.159 --> 5609.599999999999
don't know for sure it seems like she

5608.239 --> 5611.678999999999
might have

5609.6 --> 5613.92
right that's the thing that's like those

5611.679 --> 5615.76
latest

5613.92 --> 5618.4
details

5615.76 --> 5620.96
but it's not

5618.4 --> 5623.04
definitive just yet you can't just tell

5620.96 --> 5626.0
from what's happened so far but she

5623.04 --> 5628.08
might have actually rebelled against the

5626.0 --> 5630.4
system for real

5628.08 --> 5632.48
who knows may and

5630.4 --> 5634.239
all depends like can she actually

5632.48 --> 5636.718999999999
actually carry the weight of such a

5634.239 --> 5638.159
decision

5636.719 --> 5640.88
because they're gonna

5638.159 --> 5643.36
like take away any

5640.88 --> 5645.36
financial advantages fancy pants

5643.36 --> 5649.44
lollipops all that they will try to do

5645.36 --> 5649.44
that if she really goes against them

5650.719 --> 5654.639
what is this machine it's

5652.719 --> 5657.04
yeah

5654.639 --> 5659.52
apparently there's this big machine

5657.04 --> 5661.92
built in the united states

5659.52 --> 5663.76
that literally sucks the co2 out of the

5661.92 --> 5666.08
air and then stores it somewhere

5663.76 --> 5669.12
underground

5666.08 --> 5669.12
in great quantities

5669.44 --> 5673.599999999999
that

5670.84 --> 5676.0
machine i think i heard about it the

5673.6 --> 5679.56
first time

5676.0 --> 5679.56
was it on monday

5689.36 --> 5694.639
she is a puppet well she definitely was

5692.0 --> 5694.639
a puppet

5694.719 --> 5700.6
but she's an adult now

5697.6 --> 5700.6
officially

5703.76 --> 5707.360000000001
right and that means that parents can't

5706.159 --> 5711.199
basically

5707.36 --> 5711.199
legally force her to do anything

5711.44 --> 5717.36
so

5713.28 --> 5717.36
maybe she's just really sick of it all

5721.119 --> 5726.0
indoor gardeners by compressed yeah

5723.28 --> 5727.44
right but one for the unit

5726.0 --> 5730.639
yes

5727.44 --> 5730.638999999999
but that machine

5731.6 --> 5736.639
supposedly isn't doing that although it

5734.4 --> 5738.96
could just be a cover dude it could

5736.639 --> 5741.1990000000005
literally just be another robber baron

5738.96 --> 5743.76
project where they say oh we're storing

5741.199 --> 5744.879999999999
it away and they're actually secretly

5743.76 --> 5747.4400000000005
selling it

5744.88 --> 5749.679
so they're literally just stealing co2

5747.44 --> 5751.199
from everyone in the region and then

5749.679 --> 5753.4400000000005
selling it

5751.199 --> 5754.5599999999995
it's like selling you

5753.44 --> 5756.799999999999
water

5754.56 --> 5759.04
that they take away

5756.8 --> 5761.52
it might be just that kind of a scam

5759.04 --> 5766.04
that would be very typical

5761.52 --> 5766.040000000001
if that if it turns out to be that

5771.84 --> 5774.639
right

5772.719 --> 5775.92
that's like

5774.639 --> 5779.119
oh

5775.92 --> 5781.52
it's it's a good luscious land oh let's

5779.119 --> 5783.599999999999
build a machine that literally sucks all

5781.52 --> 5786.8
the water out of the air and then stores

5783.6 --> 5788.4800000000005
it into tankers huge huge tankers and it

5786.8 --> 5790.159000000001
sucks all of it out all the lakes are

5788.48 --> 5792.638999999999
drying up everything's going to [ __ ] and

5790.159 --> 5795.839999999999
then like oh you want water

5792.639 --> 5799.84
we got water it's going to cost you

5795.84 --> 5799.84
yeah that's kind of what this feels like

5802.8 --> 5806.0
this crazy machine

5811.28 --> 5815.199
they said they will sell it huh well

5813.84 --> 5817.04
there you go

5815.199 --> 5818.0
so it's just a rubber baron project

5817.04 --> 5819.84
they're just

5818.0 --> 5822.96
stealing it from the environment and

5819.84 --> 5822.96
then selling it back

5825.679 --> 5830.679
sounds like the grappler found another

5827.679 --> 5830.679
scam

5842.4 --> 5846.159
right it's almost like spaceballs

5851.28 --> 5857.04
the machine is megamate

5853.6 --> 5859.1990000000005
and then they can it and they sell it

5857.04 --> 5864.119
including to places where they literally

5859.199 --> 5864.119
robbed every they robbed the air

5904.4 --> 5907.4
hmm

5957.52 --> 5960.88
got that kind of tech yet

5959.84 --> 5963.119000000001
dude i

5960.88 --> 5966.119
i didn't just make that up like it's

5963.119 --> 5966.119
been

5966.32 --> 5968.96
talked about

5974.239 --> 5978.239
yes then makes sense co2 scrubbers as

5977.199 --> 5981.5199999999995
well like

5978.239 --> 5983.28
who call fire coal power plant scrub all

5981.52 --> 5985.92
the poison

5983.28 --> 5988.719
there's still water vapor and co2 coming

5985.92 --> 5990.8
out then yeah collect that [ __ ] if you

5988.719 --> 5995.0
can

5990.8 --> 5995.0
awesome why not

6000.08 --> 6006.48
or you let it just get into the direct

6002.719 --> 6006.4800000000005
environment and then nature

6007.6 --> 6011.1990000000005
uses it

6009.76 --> 6012.8
it's not going to be destroyed because

6011.199 --> 6014.08
there's no more poison in it it's

6012.8 --> 6015.84
scrubbed

6014.08 --> 6021.08
but they get the co2 and then they

6015.84 --> 6021.08
thrive on that in the local area right

6030.159 --> 6033.159
so

6046.8 --> 6051.84
storm underground and

6048.719 --> 6051.84
yeah yeah i've heard anyway

6075.6 --> 6078.6
huh

6087.199 --> 6089.599999999999
all right

6091.6 --> 6096.6
okay last break be back in two minutes

6140.159 --> 6143.159
so

6186.719 --> 6189.719
okay

6190.8 --> 6196.0
never mind

6192.8 --> 6196.0
somebody's on the toilet

6196.56 --> 6203.080000000001
i can hold it up anyway

6200.08 --> 6203.08
oh

6213.04 --> 6219.08
okay

6214.96 --> 6219.08
yeah i'm gonna try again

6280.719 --> 6283.719
so

6309.36 --> 6311.599999999999
yo

6313.52 --> 6317.8
no that's gross guy the inspector

that's

6320.159 --> 6323.159
yuck

6331.76 --> 6335.84
what is the current way ballers claim to

6334.08 --> 6339.6
get our value

6335.84 --> 6341.1990000000005
they don't really

6339.6 --> 6344.2390000000005
claim it

6341.199 --> 6347.5199999999995
they usually end up like saying us

6344.239 --> 6349.839999999999
pictures of from satellites

6347.52 --> 6349.84
that's

6352.4 --> 6356.48
how they establish a radius

6357.36 --> 6364.96
sort of but they don't really

6360.4 --> 6364.96
lay down elba rooney or anything anymore

6365.28 --> 6368.28

it'll carry me through like the next

6544.0 --> 6548.08
two days i think

be 2 p.m amsterdam time

6559.199 --> 6563.28
and i'm gonna join the flat earth

6560.4 --> 6568.28
debates which should start up in about

6563.28 --> 6568.28
five minutes from now i think

6570.4 --> 6577.36
do we pay water tax in the yeah sort of

6574.159 --> 6580.32
there's like a water management

6577.36 --> 6580.32
organization

6580.48 --> 6584.799999999999
and you do kind of have to pay them

6585.92 --> 6589.92
but it's not like a universal tax thing

6588.159 --> 6592.5599999999995
that literally everybo it's like if you

6589.92 --> 6594.4
have a house with a water supply then

6592.56 --> 6596.159000000001
you you have to kind of do that sort of

6594.4 --> 6599.92
thing

6596.159 --> 6599.92
and especially if you're industrial

6600.719 --> 6604.96
etc etc but anyway yeah

6606.4 --> 6609.598999999999
so again see you in the letter of debate

6608.639 --> 6614.87
chat

6609.599 --> 6646.149
and until the next video keep it flat

6614.87 --> 6646.149
[Music]

6664.08 --> 6666.159
you
