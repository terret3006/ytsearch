everyone today the weather yeah I don't

92.759 --> 102.2
know what the weather is yet it there's

97.83 --> 108.81
clouds kind of low hanging not too thick

102.2 --> 113.31
bit of Sun here and there mr. crow

108.81 --> 117.209
George is over there kind of hoped that

113.31 --> 129.6
I would bring him some bread today to

117.209 --> 133.53
you that yet hello everyone so today I

129.6 --> 138.269
only have tea with me I skipped the

133.53 --> 139.88
coffee because yeah I'm not feeling too

138.269 --> 144.15
well

139.88 --> 147.78
it was very August that's clear and nice

144.15 --> 150.65
yesterday was last night was just

147.78 --> 150.65
terrible

151.25 --> 161.76
it was almost like I was sick but not

154.829 --> 164.16
really but yeah my my stomach kept being

161.76 --> 166.95
sour I couldn't really stop doing it and

164.16 --> 169.56
then I started to get really really

166.95 --> 175.14
stressed out ended up literally

169.56 --> 177.06
screaming in my pillow for yeah a

175.14 --> 181.35
substantial amount of time I hope I

177.06 --> 185.239
didn't wake my roommates because there

181.35 --> 185.239
was just so much frustration there

185.42 --> 190.58999999999997
concerning myself I don't know it I

187.819 --> 192.14
guess that when my body gets stressed

190.59 --> 195.32
out in some way

192.14 --> 198.41
I can then sometimes by accident start

195.32 --> 201.10999999999999
deflecting that into personally

198.41 --> 207.85
attacking my own life decisions in the

201.11 --> 210.95000000000002
past as it were and me trying to somehow

207.85 --> 214.1
correct for that and it's kind of like a

210.95 --> 218.23999999999998
panic yeah move it doesn't really work

214.1 --> 223.37
too well but I am sorry do they think

218.24 --> 226.91
like yeah me just wanting things doesn't

223.37 --> 229.94
do anything it really doesn't so the

226.91 --> 234.64
only way to get those things those logos

229.94 --> 237.77
things is to just pursue it against all

234.64 --> 242.86999999999998
perceived odds against all fears and

237.77 --> 245.75
just freakin do it even sacrifice some

242.87 --> 250.55
money for that [ __ ] if necessary because

245.75 --> 255.14
nothing is free anymore really barely

250.55 --> 258.85
anything is so yeah I don't know I

255.14 --> 258.84999999999997
checked out a dating website

258.88 --> 265.76
of course yeah it took me like an hour

261.35 --> 267.74
to fill in [ __ ] a lot and then

265.76 --> 269.57
afterwards like oh yeah well you did all

267.74 --> 274.91
the work now the only thing you have to

269.57 --> 275.65999999999997
do is pay us of course but I'll see when

274.91 --> 278.87
I'll get to that

275.66 --> 284.15000000000003
I might just I might just do it just to

278.87 --> 289.13
break break from my situation and

284.15 --> 293.0
actually just arrange situations where I

289.13 --> 294.68
will be in contact with women because

293.0 --> 298.31
that's supposed to be and I don't have

294.68 --> 302.83
to freaking improvise my way to it which

298.31 --> 302.83
is like the worst

305.09 --> 314.52
anyway yeah I'm still feeling kind of

309.74 --> 317.07
shaky it's like I've just had a very

314.52 --> 318.96
intense fight with another person except

317.07 --> 321.2
the other person is me that's how it

318.96 --> 321.2
feels

326.12 --> 333.3
well George Sanford look maybe it is a

330.69 --> 335.07
waste of money I kind of agree it

333.3 --> 340.29
already feels like that

335.07 --> 343.08
like yeah it's just a whole the for more

340.29 --> 344.67
of your hopes and sweat and tears and

343.08 --> 347.19
everything in and nothing everything

344.67 --> 350.79
that's but that's the problem I can't

347.19 --> 353.21999999999997
accept that idea anymore if I don't do

350.79 --> 358.83000000000004
anything I will get nothing and I will

353.22 --> 363.26000000000005
deserve it I got to do something I can't

358.83 --> 367.74
just sit here do this freaking show like

363.26 --> 370.89
it makes me almost feel like I am I'm

367.74 --> 373.35
not but kind of maybe some of you will

370.89 --> 376.53
get it it feels like I am Nick Fuentes

373.35 --> 378.41
except 20 years later and I'm yeah my

376.53 --> 382.30999999999995
mom's dead I don't live there anymore

378.41 --> 385.53000000000003
still don't really do anything much

382.31 --> 388.41
still don't have a girlfriend that's

385.53 --> 390.80999999999995
know that is like super self shaming

388.41 --> 393.72
what I'm doing in the face of that but

390.81 --> 396.48
that's kind of like what it feels yeah

393.72 --> 400.88000000000005
from the bad side as it were sometimes

396.48 --> 407.43
like what the hell is this like what

400.88 --> 412.68
what even allows me to talk about what

407.43 --> 417.12
people should be doing when I did it so

412.68 --> 422.31
wrong so wrong when it was York so

417.12 --> 425.04
horribly horribly horribly wrong and he

422.31 --> 430.04
I knew it even then I knew it was wrong

425.04 --> 433.83000000000004
but I was just broken and it couldn't

430.04 --> 437.41900000000004
really net respect I think what was

433.83 --> 437.419
probably would have been best

437.439 --> 443.34900000000005
because nobody family could handle it if

440.379 --> 446.819
I would had just been like had a

443.349 --> 450.99899999999997
designated doctor it had some serious

446.819 --> 454.439
psychological committing not because I

450.999 --> 460.3
am acting out of control but because I

454.439 --> 464.019
was stuck and it wasn't really all that

460.3 --> 466.659
apparent not that badly still kind of

464.019 --> 469.649
did things I still learned little things

466.659 --> 472.839
but I wouldn't move forward and

469.649 --> 476.229
everybody just let me do that everybody

472.839 --> 479.019
while people condemned me on one way but

476.229 --> 481.36
not with a sensible input they they just

479.019 --> 483.669
condemned me like you're not supposed to

481.36 --> 485.889
do that this is bad that didn't make any

483.669 --> 496.50899999999996
freaking sense to me I didn't understand

485.889 --> 499.389
why and if I'd only read like put a whip

496.509 --> 502.289
behind me and just forced myself to keep

499.389 --> 505.749
on taking jobs no matter how horrific

502.289 --> 507.55
they were it wouldn't have mattered I

505.749 --> 509.86
should have done that I should have done

507.55 --> 512.649
that so I could never get used to not

509.86 --> 515.439
working because that was the death of it

512.649 --> 520.209
all the getting used to not working that

515.439 --> 525.13
was that is the worst damage a man can

520.209 --> 532.06
suffer the worst and I'm still bearing

525.13 --> 535.269
the scars of it yeah getting out of your

532.06 --> 538.779
bikes yeah doing all these things to get

535.269 --> 541.449
rid of the stress instead of fixing it

538.779 --> 544.12
no I I need to fix it and now I can't

541.449 --> 549.55
turn back time and retro actively do

544.12 --> 555.1
that all but I kind of could just break

549.55 --> 560.74
this thing that I've become away from it

555.1 --> 563.37
all and just go don't look back and just

560.74 --> 563.37
go

567.069 --> 572.5999999999999
but I don't know maybe that is because

570.019 --> 575.54
I'm feeling like this right now but it's

572.6 --> 577.6990000000001
a reoccurring theme comes back every now

575.54 --> 581.029
and then feels like punishment

577.699 --> 583.8499999999999
punishment from God for my freaking

581.029 --> 587.769
[ __ ] decision to break from logos

583.85 --> 596.779
and think I could get away with it can't

587.769 --> 599.99
couldn't nobody can and now I have to

596.779 --> 603.379
start climbing or I'll slide straight

599.99 --> 611.029
into the abyss it's only gonna get worse

603.379 --> 617.6
if I don't fix it about capitalism it's

611.029 --> 618.829
about it's about the transformation the

617.6 --> 623.559
energy

618.829 --> 626.649
it's about humility it's about not

623.559 --> 629.24
thinking you're too good for something

626.649 --> 634.339
that kind of [ __ ] and I add a lot of

629.24 --> 636.98
that no thought no that's not for me I

634.339 --> 639.8290000000001
thought I was in my head some typical

636.98 --> 642.7090000000001
you know it's always the same type of

639.829 --> 645.019
mindset no I thought look like I know

642.709 --> 647.9899999999999
I'm Way too smart I'm like above that I

645.019 --> 651.05
I would not be tricked to do a load I

647.99 --> 653.24
didn't get any of it didn't understand

651.05 --> 659.8
any of it I was all tricked by the

653.24 --> 659.8
superficial [ __ ] snobbish nonsense

682.81 --> 694.1899999999999
wait well bait 60 RMC I do look older

691.009 --> 698.75
than 25 when you meet me face to face

694.19 --> 704.5400000000001
you can ask Eric he'll the hope now that

698.75 --> 708.769
guy looks young he looks really but yeh

704.54 --> 710.5999999999999
gori gori it's is that another thing I

708.769 --> 712.79
need to feel good about that I'm still

710.6 --> 716.839
looking young even though i roughly

712.79 --> 721.79
wasted 20 years of my life on deflecting

716.839 --> 724.2790000000001
integration with society no I I don't

721.79 --> 728.5
even want to hear anything that'll make

724.279 --> 728.5
me feel better I just need to fix it I

734.84 --> 739.85
[Music]

736.99 --> 742.37
didn't I wonder what really treated

739.85 --> 744.5
there was another thing to that by the

742.37 --> 747.829
way Thank You Amanda young for the $10

744.5 --> 750.189
super chat donation yeah I really hope I

747.829 --> 756.019
feel better too sorry

750.189 --> 760.88
it's I don't mean to push this [ __ ] on

756.019 --> 763.85
people you know I think very few I'll

760.88 --> 765.11
feel out there really experience this to

763.85 --> 767.87
this degree you know there's always

765.11 --> 770.63
regrets things you haven't done at some

767.87 --> 774.11
point in your life and you can hate

770.63 --> 779.24
yourself vividly for that but this is

774.11 --> 781.22
not bad this is me at some point just

779.24 --> 787.639
thinking I could get away with it and

781.22 --> 794.4200000000001
then repeatedly doubling down okay 20

787.639 --> 797.36
years that's not a mistake that's that's

794.42 --> 799.0999999999999
not just a accidental mistake like oops

797.36 --> 801.0790000000001
I picked the wrong thing no that was

799.1 --> 801.99
like principally doubling down on the

801.079 --> 805.949
wrong thing

801.99 --> 809.23
and I really thought it it made sense

805.949 --> 811.62
doesn't because I overlooked so many

809.23 --> 811.62
things

814.11 --> 818.819
maybe I just couldn't see there yet

840.11 --> 850.249
that my mom my stomach is just like

843.029 --> 850.249
totally just killing me

864.88 --> 870.809
[Music]

874.52 --> 880.279
yeah yeah Harry's that kind piece of

877.55 --> 886.52
[ __ ] huh has nothing to do with Flat

880.279 --> 890.06
Earth [ __ ] Flat Earth only came in

886.52 --> 892.8199999999999
five years ago [ __ ] has nothing to do

890.06 --> 896.54
with this issue it's the fear 15 years

892.82 --> 899.7700000000001
preceding that all right it's the

896.54 --> 902.93
freakin indoctrination [ __ ] and the

899.77 --> 904.8199999999999
Atheist philosophy branches that I still

902.93 --> 908.5699999999999
kind of clung on to and thought they

904.82 --> 912.2900000000001
make some kind of sense right couldn't

908.57 --> 914.48
let go that [ __ ] no I have to see

912.29 --> 917.75
further I had to look I had to play the

914.48 --> 922.69
game well it was playing the game I used

917.75 --> 930.589
the game as an excuse to abandon logos

922.69 --> 931.5100000000001
and now I'm [ __ ] it has nothing to do

930.589 --> 937.9100000000001
with Flat Earth

931.51 --> 941.45
Flat Earth to me really it felt like it

937.91 --> 944.27
was actually the actual right thing do

941.45 --> 948.1400000000001
you know how I felt that because I was

944.27 --> 952.55
terrified out of my mind when that came

948.14 --> 955.1899999999999
on for real okay like since that [ __ ]

952.55 --> 959.6899999999999
started up I've become paranoid like

955.19 --> 961.5200000000001
never before I'm terrified because of

959.69 --> 963.5600000000001
Flat Earth because of the implications

961.52 --> 966.98
because of what I've seen what people

963.56 --> 969.1999999999999
have told me in the past whether they

966.98 --> 973.85
were lying or whether there was a

969.2 --> 974.57
natural unrolling belief where did that

973.85 --> 979.85
come from

974.57 --> 983.0600000000001
it's systemic I'm terrified of all of

979.85 --> 985.01
this and I and I'm just keeping on going

983.06 --> 987.17
like yeah yeah that's too bad that's

985.01 --> 988.97
that's just too freakin bad that you're

987.17 --> 991.0
terrified everybody else is used to it

988.97 --> 994.88
yeah you don't get used to it because

991.0 --> 996.8
you can still see everything else out

994.88 --> 998.54
there as well and where people are

996.8 --> 1004.079
moving and where would that will lead to

998.54 --> 1007.449
and yeah it's not a great outlook

1004.079 --> 1008.3499999999999
although it seems to be at this time we

1007.449 --> 1011.889
don't really know

1008.35 --> 1014.139
I'm just despite like yeah you have to

1011.889 --> 1017.6800000000001
be positive and you have to keep going

1014.139 --> 1020.529
there's a grim image hanging behind that

1017.68 --> 1025.72
for me and I can't really get it away I

1020.529 --> 1027.88
can only choose that either it comes and

1025.72 --> 1033.429
there's nothing I can do about it and it

1027.88 --> 1040.63
may be the only redeeming factor for

1033.429 --> 1042.91
what I've done to myself or it is a the

1040.63 --> 1047.1100000000001
most hardcore psychological test ever

1042.91 --> 1047.8600000000001
and it is just I have to do it and it'll

1047.11 --> 1052.4499999999998
be alright

1047.86 --> 1055.299
it's either way so I had no choice I had

1052.45 --> 1059.88
no choice but to do this and it's

1055.299 --> 1059.8799999999999
yielded so much it's you the people that

1060.33 --> 1070.51
that could have kind of begin to handle

1065.919 --> 1074.0800000000002
what the [ __ ] I am okay cuz try to

1070.51 --> 1077.34
imagine this just facing the regular

1074.08 --> 1081.22
people out there what that's like right

1077.34 --> 1085.54
yeah that's why I had to there was just

1081.22 --> 1092.8600000000001
no other choice I might have got a heart

1085.54 --> 1094.75
attack from the strain if I hadn't and I

1092.86 --> 1098.49
would have always jumped on the flatter

1094.75 --> 1103.57
side never on the ball side because

1098.49 --> 1105.25
there is just so little left you can

1103.57 --> 1107.29
even do with they're so little to

1105.25 --> 1110.29
explore with the ball it's all nonsense

1107.29 --> 1113.02
it's I've already been through that I

1110.29 --> 1114.6399999999999
was such a fan of it I've already read

1113.02 --> 1116.02
through all the [ __ ] and figured I'd

1114.64 --> 1118.72
wait there seems to be a lot of

1116.02 --> 1119.9189999999999
unresolved but after I already know it's

1118.72 --> 1124.1200000000001
not new to me anymore

1119.919 --> 1129.7
I played with this Legos and I know it

1124.12 --> 1131.7099999999998
now it's old to me so I was always gonna

1129.7 --> 1134.71
join on the Flat Earth debate site

1131.71 --> 1137.32
because there is on the flatter side

1134.71 --> 1139.53
because there is so much to discover and

1137.32 --> 1142.71
figure out in Tinker and

1139.53 --> 1147.84
work with to keep me busy in my

1142.71 --> 1150.45
intellect desperately desperate busying

1147.84 --> 1155.6899999999998
therapy that is actually sensible and

1150.45 --> 1158.8500000000001
gratifying and not just a another robot

1155.69 --> 1161.22
factory for the intellect that you're

1158.85 --> 1163.02
being forced to subject your intellect

1161.22 --> 1166.56
you would like so many things out there

1163.02 --> 1170.55
these days or just pure file demonic

1166.56 --> 1174.3
corruptions I either mental slave

1170.55 --> 1181.02
factory [ __ ] or vile demonic eruption

1174.3 --> 1184.11
which one you like now Flat Earth has

1181.02 --> 1188.36
been the only thing that's given me some

1184.11 --> 1188.36
kind of breathing room intellectually

1193.85 --> 1196.85
sheesh

1203.31 --> 1210.85
HM it was hard for me before waking up

1207.91 --> 1214.75
to the truth it was hard for me waking

1210.85 --> 1217.51
up to that 9/11 was an inside job

1214.75 --> 1222.73
you know how many fights I had out for

1217.51 --> 1227.8
that like I won time I'll just bring it

1222.73 --> 1231.82
up you know they don't even know nobody

1227.8 --> 1234.46
from them like ever follows me they

1231.82 --> 1236.77
don't care they're so on the other side

1234.46 --> 1239.23
but there I was like with my

1236.77 --> 1242.61
ex-girlfriend still my girlfriend then

1239.23 --> 1247.3
over to one of her friends families and

1242.61 --> 1250.1499999999999
yeah the teenagers there and everything

1247.3 --> 1252.61
and then suddenly yeah there was like

1250.15 --> 1256.1200000000001
this gushing doubling down against the

1252.61 --> 1257.55
terrorists and all we have to provide we

1256.12 --> 1260.6499999999999
have to help total statism

1257.55 --> 1263.56
indoctrination response and I was just

1260.65 --> 1266.14
like you but yeah but it was an inside

1263.56 --> 1268.48
job I like I dropped and it seems so

1266.14 --> 1272.0800000000002
basic now to say this right this is

1268.48 --> 1275.23
basic you could almost say this anywhere

1272.08 --> 1277.6899999999998
in any family and nobody would be like

1275.23 --> 1279.46
oh yeah now they would be like girl I

1277.69 --> 1282.28
wouldn't go there or oh you into

1279.46 --> 1286.69
conspiracy but yeah but what happened

1282.28 --> 1290.1299999999999
with me back then is that like the girl

1286.69 --> 1293.67
the sister of the friend just became

1290.13 --> 1298.18
literally hysterical started screaming

1293.67 --> 1300.8500000000001
and almost physically assaulted me it

1298.18 --> 1303.3
was crazy and I got really pissed off

1300.85 --> 1306.4299999999998
back because I was sitting on just this

1303.3 --> 1308.9199999999998
compact frustration of why don't people

1306.43 --> 1311.17
get this please wake up and move on I

1308.92 --> 1313.8400000000001
was very desperate for the waking up of

1311.17 --> 1318.3400000000001
everyone back then still relatively

1313.84 --> 1320.77
isolated and bang and then they hated me

1318.34 --> 1323.53
they like really hated me because I

1320.77 --> 1328.0
showed anger in the face of a teenager

1323.53 --> 1330.04
who was severely misbehaving but yeah

1328.0 --> 1332.35
I'm supposed to be an adult like in my

1330.04 --> 1335.44
30s and yeah retrospect that was kind of

1332.35 --> 1337.54
stupid but

1335.44 --> 1339.8200000000002
see that's the [ __ ] like I've been

1337.54 --> 1344.34
always in this [ __ ] you think Flat Earth

1339.82 --> 1347.71
is special with nutcases everywhere

1344.34 --> 1351.58
making your life miserable well guess

1347.71 --> 1355.42
what there are so many lesser lower

1351.58 --> 1359.1299999999999
layer subjects that back then ten years

1355.42 --> 1364.27
ago people go nuts over just like this

1359.13 --> 1367.2900000000002
and it was terrible back then and I

1364.27 --> 1372.24
didn't really like a lot of 9/11 errs

1367.29 --> 1375.34
they were all obsessed like like pretty

1372.24 --> 1377.38
almost stoic and just rigid about the

1375.34 --> 1380.83
details rigid about getting the details

1377.38 --> 1384.13
right not very sociable not very

1380.83 --> 1386.6499999999999
interested in in communities as it were

1384.13 --> 1388.48
from what I've experienced and that's

1386.65 --> 1391.51
different with Flat Earth there's a much

1388.48 --> 1397.69
more sense of community that I've been

1391.51 --> 1402.52
experiencing in this group I guess

1397.69 --> 1405.79
because they have to it's it's not

1402.52 --> 1408.36
really a direct attempt anymore to it to

1405.79 --> 1411.1
correct a mistake now it is like

1408.36 --> 1413.53
pointing at the very foundation of so

1411.1 --> 1417.3999999999999
much you can't just correct it you have

1413.53 --> 1419.79
to be a community and then almost a

1417.4 --> 1419.7900000000002
planet

1432.28 --> 1436.599
[Music]

1441.25 --> 1452.77
[Music]

1449.32 --> 1456.49
all right let's try something vegetarian

1452.77 --> 1461.86
yeah well the thing is with Flat Earth

1456.49 --> 1464.41
this is one of the most pronounced part

1461.86 --> 1468.1
of the control system but it's with so

1464.41 --> 1470.8000000000002
many things some people have it like if

1468.1 --> 1473.29
you dare to say that some kind of

1470.8 --> 1476.62
terrorist attack on a school shooting or

1473.29 --> 1480.1599999999999
something was faked then there's people

1476.62 --> 1482.4699999999998
out there that like literally would go

1480.16 --> 1487.65
nuts over it and like think you are a

1482.47 --> 1489.8500000000001
danger and are like go into offensive

1487.65 --> 1492.3100000000002
psychiatrist mode like oh we need to

1489.85 --> 1495.37
lock them up in their minds that's what

1492.31 --> 1497.4099999999999
they do with with such a basic thing so

1495.37 --> 1502.84
if you think it's just the global

1497.41 --> 1506.3500000000001
response no it's everywhere and people

1502.84 --> 1508.78
fall into the trap of that behavior all

1506.35 --> 1513.52
the time where does that come from well

1508.78 --> 1517.96
need they need they have like an inner

1513.52 --> 1521.35
neat vent of their personal stretch

1517.96 --> 1526.15
through rigid judgment through hammering

1521.35 --> 1533.08
and that comes from being part of a

1526.15 --> 1536.8300000000002
system that's not really helping you be

1533.08 --> 1539.32
better it's just a strain and all that

1536.83 --> 1542.8899999999999
strain is causing stress so there will

1539.32 --> 1545.62
be natural outlet needs to vent it off

1542.89 --> 1547.2700000000002
and that's where for example those types

1545.62 --> 1549.31
of behaviors start to get grounded

1547.27 --> 1553.21
people become very convicted about a

1549.31 --> 1555.22
certain thing and then they can even get

1553.21 --> 1557.41
obsessed over it and that's because

1555.22 --> 1559.54
there is a stress in their general life

1557.41 --> 1562.0
that they're not handling and then

1559.54 --> 1563.77
they're finding a mechanism to vent it

1562.0 --> 1565.69
off as a temporary measure and then they

1563.77 --> 1568.8
stick to that temporary measure and then

1565.69 --> 1568.8
it's like an addiction

1591.8 --> 1598.73
yeah well Sparrow music that's very nice

1594.92 --> 1601.5800000000002
that you are very moderate and polite

1598.73 --> 1607.33
with that but that's not everyone and

1601.58 --> 1611.6599999999999
that's what is it now 18 years later

1607.33 --> 1613.85
right well back then that not a lot of

1611.66 --> 1616.19
people were so that wasn't a thing yet

1613.85 --> 1619.3999999999999
to be subtle about it it was actually

1616.19 --> 1621.6200000000001
still reinforced through media that

1619.4 --> 1623.8400000000001
whenever it was was brought up that you

1621.62 --> 1626.03
should be outraged one way or the other

1623.84 --> 1628.52
against the terrorists or against people

1626.03 --> 1631.19
that said it could have been faked was

1628.52 --> 1634.94
the conditioning was super powerful and

1631.19 --> 1639.74
you know it so yeah now you figured it

1634.94 --> 1643.06
out yeah that's nice the ten years ago

1639.74 --> 1643.06
that wouldn't have been so easy

1647.02 --> 1650.16
[Music]

1655.97 --> 1661.299
I know called lotty's I know

1665.05 --> 1668.26
[Music]

1699.52 --> 1702.12
huh

1710.83 --> 1715.09
the court I teach English well that

1713.23 --> 1718.8700000000001
certainly would probably take the

1715.09 --> 1723.82
passion out of it if I'd had to do that

1718.87 --> 1730.6499999999999
like day in day out well like if I had

1723.82 --> 1734.1399999999999
to go through like lists and [ __ ] oh

1730.65 --> 1740.8600000000001
yeah I definitely lose my passion for

1734.14 --> 1743.68
the language no I could always teach

1740.86 --> 1746.28
English as a side thing but I'm never

1743.68 --> 1749.71
gonna make it any kind of primary

1746.28 --> 1750.25
profession that would totally ruin it

1749.71 --> 1754.42
for me

1750.25 --> 1758.86
Oh Thank You Irene bear for the free

1754.42 --> 1761.77
super chats it yeah I'm getting more I

1758.86 --> 1766.6599999999999
kind of like it it's like throwing a

1761.77 --> 1773.68
nickel you know are we need some nickel

1766.66 --> 1775.8400000000001
too and if you're getting the nickel

1773.68 --> 1779.71
free from Google well then why not give

1775.84 --> 1782.1599999999999
it to our and you know thank you iron

1779.71 --> 1782.16
bear

1793.809 --> 1801.23
now try something vegetarian I don't

1796.909 --> 1808.179
have a wish to prove to Antarctica but I

1801.23 --> 1811.669
have a wish for is to fix my life to

1808.179 --> 1813.5900000000001
actually have a family and kids in a

1811.669 --> 1817.519
place that I can call my own and that I

1813.59 --> 1820.4599999999998
is my territory that is what I want and

1817.519 --> 1823.75
when I get that then I'll start thinking

1820.46 --> 1827.33
about some crazy journey into Iceland's

1823.75 --> 1830.45
into frozen lands before that's not my

1827.33 --> 1835.1899999999998
priority it's not like I wouldn't want

1830.45 --> 1838.429
to die in a frozen place like that if

1835.19 --> 1841.46
from this situation because literally I

1838.429 --> 1849.8500000000001
would everyone would forget I if I could

1841.46 --> 1849.8500000000001
ever existed no thanks

1880.98 --> 1887.25
not try something vegetarian the

1885.0 --> 1889.44
dichotomy does not matter what does

1887.25 --> 1892.519
matter however is the truth and the

1889.44 --> 1892.519
consequences of it

1904.79 --> 1908.9189999999999
filthy piece of [ __ ] piss off

1911.27 --> 1915.529
[Music]

1916.06 --> 1919.28
[Applause]

1920.28 --> 1925.68
[Music]

1946.73 --> 1955.22
oh really so one thing something is

1951.02 --> 1959.29
beating no no people want a lot of

1955.22 --> 1962.99
things doesn't it doesn't mean anything

1959.29 --> 1965.42
use people start out wanting things and

1962.99 --> 1969.13
then they get stupid enough to convince

1965.42 --> 1969.13
themselves that there's a better way

1969.28 --> 1976.49
that there is a new another something

1972.11 --> 1977.99
different that's the problem we already

1976.49 --> 1981.38
want those things it doesn't mean

1977.99 --> 1985.94
anything you have to get them you can't

1981.38 --> 1991.3700000000001
just wanting something means nothing

1985.94 --> 2002.97
teaches you very little you need to get

1991.37 --> 2002.9699999999998
it candles

2007.32 --> 2009.8899999999999
is

2018.6 --> 2028.08
I have no idea what you're talking about

2022.309 --> 2030.3799999999999
it's kind of silly besides I already got

2028.08 --> 2030.3799999999999
one

2043.36 --> 2046.3899999999999
[Music]

2056.68 --> 2059.7
yes I do

2063.53 --> 2069.71
you don't need to bring that up okay I

2066.05 --> 2072.7400000000002
am NOT a poor little guy that doesn't

2069.71 --> 2076.07
know what did you I don't know what did

2072.74 --> 2078.74
you in my position I am a dumb Flat

2076.07 --> 2081.409
Earth you and I don't know how to get it

2078.74 --> 2084.2599999999998
no I do know I do know how to get help

2081.409 --> 2086.51
I do get Social Work I do get people to

2084.26 --> 2088.4900000000002
talk to I am very open in my

2086.51 --> 2090.909
communication I don't hold anything back

2088.49 --> 2096.83
I don't have a problem with that at all

2090.909 --> 2099.6800000000003
communication is my primary skill okay I

2096.83 --> 2101.99
don't have a problem I don't need advice

2099.68 --> 2108.25
from people that I need to talk to

2101.99 --> 2112.5699999999997
people okay ever so one thing I learned

2108.25 --> 2116.359
even when I was freaking 17 I was giving

2112.57 --> 2118.7000000000003
psychological advice to my counselor and

2116.359 --> 2121.369
not the other way around because he

2118.7 --> 2124.25
needed it and he couldn't give me

2121.369 --> 2130.01
anything because I know how to

2124.25 --> 2132.95
communicate it's not the problem

2130.01 --> 2137.4500000000003
communication is not the problem the

2132.95 --> 2143.18
problem is passivity that is my problem

2137.45 --> 2146.0
problem is a the impulse don't easily

2143.18 --> 2152.27
push me over the threshold of action

2146.0 --> 2155.119
that's the problem I'm reluctant and

2152.27 --> 2158.57
it's a terrible quality it's a safe

2155.119 --> 2160.81
quality but if you then let it anchor

2158.57 --> 2165.38
too much it becomes a terrible quality

2160.81 --> 2167.21
reluctance is very safe way to start up

2165.38 --> 2174.9500000000003
something but if you end up with

2167.21 --> 2177.7
something with reluctance then it's not

2174.95 --> 2177.7
going to be great

2178.349 --> 2193.2290000000003
a bit of over generalization but you

2191.309 --> 2196.4990000000003
know if you don't know anything then

2193.229 --> 2199.9199999999996
it's very good to be careful but once

2196.499 --> 2201.779
you've gotten there you shouldn't be

2199.92 --> 2205.14
reluctant anymore you should be

2201.779 --> 2207.809
consequent should go forward you should

2205.14 --> 2212.19
trust what you learned you should act

2207.809 --> 2215.219
upon what you learn there is no more

2212.19 --> 2217.109
sense in reluctance after that if it's

2215.219 --> 2220.2290000000003
still there then you got a problem

2217.109 --> 2222.469
I got a problem big problem it's

2220.229 --> 2225.299
torturing me literally in the night

2222.469 --> 2227.329
torturing me making me scream in the

2225.299 --> 2227.329
night

2231.75 --> 2234.84
[Music]

2252.81 --> 2260.37
yeah it's a scam should be abolished

2257.45 --> 2263.8199999999997
politicians that have done that should

2260.37 --> 2266.43
all be fired and just never allowed into

2263.82 --> 2274.25
politics ever again should all be

2266.43 --> 2274.25
banished get out

2290.1 --> 2297.63
no God is try something vegetarian I

2294.93 --> 2300.8399999999997
know there's no conspiracy here okay

2297.63 --> 2302.9100000000003
there's no secret follower for oh my god

2300.84 --> 2304.7400000000002
they have all the power you have no

2302.91 --> 2307.92
control because if they wanted they

2304.74 --> 2310.41
could use each oh you have no control

2307.92 --> 2316.71
because they can destroy your mind fear

2310.41 --> 2319.83
porn fear porn fear porn no that's all

2316.71 --> 2322.71
[ __ ] they can wobble around with you

2319.83 --> 2324.36
a little maybe well that'll do is yeah

2322.71 --> 2325.7400000000002
when you're stressed out you'll get a

2324.36 --> 2327.33
little bit more stressed out and then

2325.74 --> 2329.1299999999997
you act typically on being a little bit

2327.33 --> 2331.83
more stressed out that's the only thing

2329.13 --> 2335.25
they can really do that's all [ __ ]

2331.83 --> 2339.81
fear porn no there's no control

2335.25 --> 2343.11
what's torturing me is logos is my bad

2339.81 --> 2344.43
decision it's God its creation it's my

2343.11 --> 2361.4700000000003
design

2344.43 --> 2363.77
me sorry for overreacting immolating

2361.47 --> 2363.77
here

2366.78 --> 2374.9700000000003
yeah there's no voice there is no voice

2371.43 --> 2376.98
it's me it's a feeling is mine it's a

2374.97 --> 2379.74
memory it's things falling into place

2376.98 --> 2381.9900000000002
and slapping me in the face non-stop not

2379.74 --> 2385.22
letting go not letting me look away not

2381.99 --> 2389.04
letting me forget that is what it is

2385.22 --> 2391.74
it's no voice of God some kind of

2389.04 --> 2393.39
synthetic hallucination [ __ ] or anything

2391.74 --> 2395.81
it's me

2393.39 --> 2398.64
its nature it's the natural

2395.81 --> 2400.83
psychological function it's the

2398.64 --> 2404.18
consequences of doing things and having

2400.83 --> 2404.18
a conscious

2431.709 --> 2447.3799999999997
all right Cleary

2433.64 --> 2452.209
see you got another icon not Robin

2447.38 --> 2454.94
Stanley look I'm not apologizing for

2452.209 --> 2457.069
what I do it's just that some people I

2454.94 --> 2459.709
don't really know all that well they may

2457.069 --> 2461.469
be here in chat for the first time and

2459.709 --> 2465.68
if they're they're gonna ask something

2461.469 --> 2466.67
that is kind of normalized even though

2465.68 --> 2470.239
it is no offense

2466.67 --> 2472.309
in my view then they don't need to be

2470.239 --> 2474.099
deserve some kind of punishment for them

2472.309 --> 2476.6600000000003
because they don't know any better it's

2474.099 --> 2479.15
wasn't meant as some kind of trolling I

2476.66 --> 2482.3289999999997
think if their new look if it's like

2479.15 --> 2484.13
Lottie or Laurie then you know they know

2482.329 --> 2485.8390000000004
then it's [ __ ] they have no excuse

2484.13 --> 2489.4
but if there's a newcomer I shouldn't be

2485.839 --> 2492.259
just outright yelling like that so sorry

2489.4 --> 2497.9790000000003
newcomers just that I'm just so stressed

2492.259 --> 2497.979
out today I'll survive but

2508.53 --> 2513.9900000000002
yeah that sounds good test everything

2511.44 --> 2516.27
you learn transforming reactive to

2513.99 --> 2518.9399999999996
proactive yeah if you're yeah yeah

2516.27 --> 2523.44
that's actually exactly that's exactly

2518.94 --> 2526.7400000000002
on target that that roughly describes

2523.44 --> 2528.77
the process that I'm yeah and it's

2526.74 --> 2532.4399999999996
happening

2528.77 --> 2536.1
I'm trying from step away from the

2532.44 --> 2539.85
reactivity from the assumption of

2536.1 --> 2544.65
reactivity to like no I want that [ __ ] I

2539.85 --> 2546.9
got a do it even though seemingly if I'd

2544.65 --> 2548.94
when I do it everything starts to go

2546.9 --> 2550.8
insane to me and I don't like her I

2548.94 --> 2555.14
understand anything and I no longer Know

2550.8 --> 2555.1400000000003
Who I am I still have to [ __ ] do it

2557.24 --> 2576.66
do it no matter what I'm not gonna let

2569.31 --> 2578.49
the devil take this away from me I don't

2576.66 --> 2583.8199999999997
want the gym membership

2578.49 --> 2588.2099999999996
I don't like gyms I don't need gyms ok

2583.82 --> 2591.6600000000003
you know how much of a workout being

2588.21 --> 2596.42
pissed off is let's trust me that's a

2591.66 --> 2601.92
lot of muscle strain going on and

2596.42 --> 2605.1
besides everything I do is with energy

2601.92 --> 2608.94
no I don't seem off flatlander I just

2605.1 --> 2611.2999999999997
seem pissed off because I am pissed off

2608.94 --> 2611.3
I'm

2613.58 --> 2622.97
I feel like a baller should feel when

2620.51 --> 2625.01
they got whipped by Nathan in the Flat

2622.97 --> 2627.1099999999997
Earth debate but they're so numbed out

2625.01 --> 2632.42
that they're making the wrong choice

2627.11 --> 2636.6200000000003
well it's this it's just waking up doing

2632.42 --> 2638.69
the right thing it's always that always

2636.62 --> 2641.42
and you think you know what's the right

2638.69 --> 2645.55
thing from your perspective right

2641.42 --> 2648.38
well you don't not if you're gonna be

2645.55 --> 2651.23
excluding things in that oversight on

2648.38 --> 2652.9700000000003
purpose because certainly your model

2651.23 --> 2657.53
doesn't really work anymore whether it

2652.97 --> 2665.33
be your world model or your life model

2657.53 --> 2669.25
yeah yeah it's the same thing all of it

2665.33 --> 2669.25
it's all the same all of it

2683.66 --> 2689.1299999999997
and I really didn't needed extra coffee

2686.869 --> 2691.67
you know what I mean I think that was a

2689.13 --> 2691.67
good decision

2698.76 --> 2702.6290000000004
[Music]

2703.069 --> 2713.4
no he's not gods are you some kind of

2713.4 --> 2722.9990000000003

2749.43 --> 2753.4199999999996
followers are horrible and he doesn't

2751.349 --> 2757.65
educate them he doesn't tell them like

2795.96 --> 2804.45
right right you know the guy you know

2800.23 --> 2808.66
that he practically single-handedly

2804.45 --> 2811.93
introduced the shill meme that not just

2808.66 --> 2815.04
shook the flat earth she'll meme that's

2811.93 --> 2817.72
Eric Dubay why don't you look into it

2815.04 --> 2821.35
look who's starting to talk about that

2817.72 --> 2824.7999999999997
look look how that worked he freakin

2821.35 --> 2826.9
personally introduced that [ __ ] started

2824.8 --> 2829.3300000000004
pointing at every freaking flat earther

2826.9 --> 2831.52

2829.33 --> 2836.02
jesus you you're all shows everybody's a

2831.52 --> 2839.5
shell but Eric too big yeah he did that

2836.02 --> 2840.9
you can thank him for that you know

2839.5 --> 2843.58
others picked that up

2840.9 --> 2845.89
Antonio picked up all kinds of dirty

2843.58 --> 2852.84
tricks he started it

2845.89 --> 2852.8399999999997
Eric Dubay yeah and thank him for that

2855.73 --> 2858.7690000000002
[Music]

2874.95 --> 2881.74
it doesn't matter spare room music look

2879.06 --> 2886.12
what I'm talking about Eric Dubay is

2881.74 --> 2890.7
that he created the flat earth she'll

2886.12 --> 2894.19
height he made everybody spiral about

2890.7 --> 2899.08
everybody's issue he literally created

2894.19 --> 2902.79
the she'll height okay like no one else

2899.08 --> 2913.63
he pointed out he made it a thing

2902.79 --> 2917.56
really stop kidding you know it's like

2913.63 --> 2919.3900000000003
and he also introduced in a way well

2917.56 --> 2923.38
maybe no I don't know where that really

2919.39 --> 2926.7999999999997
came from look like real trans fest

2923.38 --> 2929.62
again obsession maybe I don't know the

2926.8 --> 2932.8300000000004
pimple but he definitely he goes

2929.62 --> 2938.95
everywhere he eat it's like the Savannah

2932.83 --> 2941.68
syndrome like no pocket is too dirty to

2938.95 --> 2945.37
put your hands in that's the Savannah

2941.68 --> 2947.68
complex no place is too dirty to go

2945.37 --> 2950.44
there that's the Savannah complex

2947.68 --> 2952.6
nothing is too disgusting not to let it

2950.44 --> 2957.46
roll out of your mouth that's the

2952.6 --> 2962.2599999999998
Sylvania complex no level of shameless

2957.46 --> 2967.66
behavior could ever be unjustified

2962.26 --> 2970.5600000000004
that's the chevalier complex do you

2967.66 --> 2970.56
understand now

2988.67 --> 2996.089
that's not shield Vanya snow NASA Vanya

2992.579 --> 3002.599
is simply just an attention-grabbing

2996.089 --> 3007.119
whiny manipulator it's a method it's a

3002.599 --> 3015.92
very dirty method that makes people

3007.119 --> 3019.279
spiral it's almost like a like a dirt

3015.92 --> 3022.19
like a savanna is just somebody walking

3019.279 --> 3024.19
around playing some kind of song that

3022.19 --> 3026.719
just can't get out of your head

3024.19 --> 3029.4500000000003
that's a savanna and then a lot of

3026.719 --> 3032.539
people unfortunately eventually start

3029.45 --> 3034.3999999999996
following that and then pointing at

3032.539 --> 3038.2290000000003
other people here in the song for the

3034.4 --> 3038.2290000000003
first time that's the serve Vanya

3049.369 --> 3055.53
little lads - no it has nothing to do

3053.13 --> 3060.03
with small hats although I think that

3055.53 --> 3062.55
small hats what they could have invented

3060.03 --> 3065.1600000000003
the concept they might have but is not

3062.55 --> 3069.4500000000003
exclusive to small hats they're just a

3065.16 --> 3077.58
little better at it it's also a little

3069.45 --> 3079.95
bit more subtle yeah but it you don't

3077.58 --> 3083.24
have to be is some you know a small hat

3079.95 --> 3083.24
to be a so Vanya

3100.08 --> 3105.22
yeah try something that you did look at

3102.64 --> 3107.35
there was a Vanya thing I don't know

3105.22 --> 3111.22
what I would been Djimon how he sees it

3107.35 --> 3113.3199999999997
I'm I'm kind of I I assimilated the

3111.22 --> 3116.56
concept because I'm really inspired by

3113.32 --> 3120.28
it and I'm just trying to chisel on it

3116.56 --> 3122.95
to make it even more pure maybe a lot of

3120.28 --> 3126.3700000000003
people or maybe own venue will say that

3122.95 --> 3128.4399999999996
stupid Arwen guy doesn't know what he's

3126.37 --> 3130.54
talking about he's doing it all wrong I

3128.44 --> 3134.43
don't know could be maybe this is not

3130.54 --> 3134.43
the so Vanya he was looking for

3159.9 --> 3164.069
hmm all right oh yeah that's right I

3163.38 --> 3169.6800000000003
almost forgot

3164.069 --> 3173.339
I I totally forgot yeah Tom Parker was

3169.68 --> 3175.3799999999997
actually gonna come on today but I think

3173.339 --> 3180.029
I got a little distracted what does the

3175.38 --> 3190.319
saying mean in my Skype well it's an

3180.029 --> 3202.529
that just kind of straightforward it

3190.319 --> 3204.829
means what it says keyboarding it's a

3202.529 --> 3204.829
vacation

3207.73 --> 3210.7690000000002
[Music]

3212.21 --> 3219.779
yeah well that's saying I made it it's

3216.39 --> 3225.96
it's like a spell or a chance it's not

3219.779 --> 3228.66
anything evil so but it's based in the

3225.96 --> 3231.69
mode of Steiner approach so it's

3228.66 --> 3236.339
anthroposophical in a way and they have

3231.69 --> 3238.589
a certain kind of energy view on on the

3236.339 --> 3242.3089999999997
situation that's expressed in the path

3238.589 --> 3246.239
of Christ I more detailed it out it's

3242.309 --> 3247.799
basically the right way what you're

3246.239 --> 3251.43
supposed to be doing in your life and

3247.799 --> 3255.45
then there's the distractions from both

3251.43 --> 3258.029
sides from both Lucifer the trickster

3255.45 --> 3261.93
the the seducer that makes you think

3258.029 --> 3265.41
you're more than what you are and are

3261.93 --> 3268.16
among Death the destroyer the one

3265.41 --> 3273.3289999999997
eventually waiting for you at the end

3268.16 --> 3274.98
for your body and who will depress and

3273.329 --> 3275.6400000000003
discourage you and tell you it's not

3274.98 --> 3279.44
worth it

3275.64 --> 3279.44
that's what that's about

3281.51 --> 3288.1090000000004
so you met it may better understand the

3284.16 --> 3288.109
context of it as well that way

3308.69 --> 3314.02
is that an answer to your satisfaction

3310.91 --> 3314.02
Tom Parker

3321.43 --> 3327.46
oh yeah Laurie yeah I should unban

3325.42 --> 3332.73
Laurie he was a complete dick yesterday

3327.46 --> 3336.13
but I said I wouldn't ban him you know

3332.73 --> 3338.44
he's over Albin yeah I've really not

3336.13 --> 3341.62
been that bad although he seems to be

3338.44 --> 3343.63
just neurotically wanting to poke Karen

3341.62 --> 3353.38
beat every time she gets in here that's

3343.63 --> 3356.1
very annoying but yeah he's not the only

3353.38 --> 3356.1
one it seems

3360.619 --> 3363.619
okay

3366.0 --> 3371.51
oh yeah I'm probably gonna run that to

fix everything they could just have yeah

3421.03 --> 3429.55
an organization of the banned list I

3423.61 --> 3432.13
found right should be too hard to put a

3429.55 --> 3435.3100000000004
date in to it as to when it was the

3432.13 --> 3438.58

3516.46 --> 3524.71
joyful so ya know a and blatantly

downs I'm fine with 10th man I've he's

3531.34 --> 3540.4300000000003

3533.92 --> 3543.7000000000003
very loyal as a friend like very

3540.43 --> 3545.44
seriously loyal as a friend yeah even in

3543.7 --> 3548.3999999999996

3545.44 --> 3550.84

3548.4 --> 3553.1800000000003
yeah I started out a bit annoying I

3550.84 --> 3555.1000000000004
thought like oh ok everytime silly

3553.18 --> 3558.25
little joke it gets a bit annoying but

3555.1 --> 3560.62
he's grown better at it there is more

3558.25 --> 3565.02
material to joke with hey I do it myself

3560.62 --> 3569.44
now sometimes you know it's a it's like

3565.02 --> 3572.8
let's let talk let's talk about gravity

3569.44 --> 3581.32
over tea and doughnuts you know love

3572.8 --> 3584.82

3581.32 --> 3584.82
10th man better than they used to

3585.93 --> 3593.83
no you don't we don't need to talk

3588.82 --> 3596.46
Allenby you have no function in relation

3593.83 --> 3601.0
to me okay

3596.46 --> 3603.82
only function you have is pretending to

3601.0 --> 3607.03
be someone that involves themselves with

3603.82 --> 3608.8900000000003
me and cares in some way and then red

3607.03 --> 3612.3700000000003
herring everything and making silly

3608.89 --> 3616.45
little British laughs like it's some

3612.37 --> 3622.54
kind of funny act that's what you do we

3616.45 --> 3625.5899999999997
don't need to do anything Allenby just

3622.54 --> 3625.59
show your face first

3626.24 --> 3629.3799999999997
[Music]

3634.37 --> 3640.6389999999997
[Music]

3637.51 --> 3640.639
[Applause]

3641.18 --> 3648.21
no Allenby no anything you put there

3645.53 --> 3650.13
earlier with our interactions when I

3648.21 --> 3654.17
still thought you are actually trying to

3650.13 --> 3657.7400000000002
be a real person it's all faded away

3654.17 --> 3660.9900000000002
it's just the icon and the name and your

3657.74 --> 3662.6699999999996
rinse and repeat same methodology of

3660.99 --> 3665.0299999999997
rolling I'm really at this point

3662.67 --> 3667.53
starting to wonder if you're actually a

3665.03 --> 3669.6600000000003
flesh-and-blood human being at this

3667.53 --> 3673.619
point or if you're just some

3669.66 --> 3676.0499999999997
experimental algorithm troll with

3673.619 --> 3679.02
accompanied with a voice generator just

3676.05 --> 3680.88
to just a screw around because you've

3679.02 --> 3686.46
never shown your face you've never shown

3680.88 --> 3689.6400000000003
any kind of like anything that would

3686.46 --> 3694.02
hint that you shared anything that is

3689.64 --> 3696.06
really about you in any way everything

3694.02 --> 3699.06
you put out is all an act it's all an

3696.06 --> 3701.16
act of a person I trust nothing that

3699.06 --> 3705.0
comes from you Alan be nothing not a

3701.16 --> 3708.56
word another suggestion or the suggested

3705.0 --> 3708.56
intensity nothing

3715.49 --> 3719.49
he's an act

3717.26 --> 3720.92
there's somebody in act I don't even

3719.49 --> 3724.35
care why he does it

3720.92 --> 3727.25
he's an act maybe he's just incapable of

3724.35 --> 3730.5899999999997
actually showing who he is

3727.25 --> 3732.72
it's just psychologically incapable some

3730.59 --> 3734.7000000000003
of the people are so messed up that it

3732.72 --> 3743.1899999999996
can just never show who they are ever

3734.7 --> 3745.1099999999997
again so maybe he's in that category all

3743.19 --> 3753.09
right so I'm gonna round out this crazy

3745.11 --> 3755.88
crazy show it's been a bit of a ride eh

3753.09 --> 3759.69
yeah I hope you I'm I'm kind of okay

3755.88 --> 3762.3900000000003
like this is not a thing that'll get

3759.69 --> 3765.69
worse and where it's just got a really

3762.39 --> 3770.27
bad night got whipped by me by my own

3765.69 --> 3772.7000000000003
psychology and actions from my past and

3770.27 --> 3776.67
