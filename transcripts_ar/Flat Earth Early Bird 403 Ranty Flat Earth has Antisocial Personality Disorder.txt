70.84 --> 79.33
yeah today well the weather is just

74.369 --> 85.39
amazing look at this so bright and sunny

79.33 --> 89.08
and I actually managed to go back and

85.39 --> 91.6
forth to the grocery store in within the

89.08 --> 93.97
time span of 50 minutes because the Sun

91.6 --> 98.77
is very pleasant it's not even that cold

93.97 --> 100.98
there's not a lot of wind yeah it's

98.77 --> 100.97999999999999
beautiful

108.64 --> 131.41
I hope it stays that way so I got minty

125.5 --> 137.26
with me here and yeah despite everything

131.41 --> 139.209
I feel pretty good yeah so some of you

137.26 --> 142.0
may have to take a notice as to the

139.209 --> 146.17000000000002
title of this show don't know if it's

142.0 --> 150.85
gonna stay that way but I definitely

146.17 --> 151.76999999999998
wanted to emphasize that for a moment

150.85 --> 154.68
for people

151.77 --> 157.81
although yeah generally I don't really

154.68 --> 162.75
like to go after people or dedicate

157.81 --> 165.489
shows entirely to attacking individuals

162.75 --> 168.25
because yeah that's just something I

165.489 --> 171.76
don't do you know others do that it's

168.25 --> 174.04
not my thing and I'm kind of I want to

171.76 --> 175.51
be persistent about it what doesn't mean

174.04 --> 179.07
that I'm not gonna address certain

175.51 --> 179.07
issues as they transpire

183.84 --> 193.379
yeah so we all know the individual in

188.95 --> 195.849
question here is using Sauk accounts and

193.379 --> 198.81
it's probably present in my chat right

195.849 --> 205.29
now because he's a control freak and

198.81 --> 208.69
yeah they're very persistent by

205.29 --> 213.099
themselves it's one of the typical

208.69 --> 216.31
things about these types of people that

213.099 --> 219.51899999999998
have this type of antisocial personality

216.31 --> 222.88
disorder because I've been looking up

219.519 --> 224.739
again what are these the meaning of

222.88 --> 231.73
these words what they do they really

224.739 --> 234.61
signify because it's been kind of thrown

231.73 --> 237.79
out there so much that people on average

234.61 --> 242.67000000000002
tend to throw back on these words very

237.79 --> 247.78
easily but do they really understand

242.67 --> 251.94
what it means what it yeah the words

247.78 --> 254.829
psychopath or sociopath you know

251.94 --> 256.66
throughout the movies it's already been

254.829 --> 258.54900000000004
addressed a certain way certain types

256.66 --> 263.65000000000003
are put forward and then people

258.549 --> 267.099
typically associate rob a certain types

263.65 --> 268.92999999999995
of behavior with that but it's become

267.099 --> 272.05
very watered down very colloquial

268.93 --> 276.37
because what it really comes from is

272.05 --> 279.789
very specific it's real mental disorders

276.37 --> 282.58
and you can say oh but psychiatrics is

279.789 --> 284.139
all fake and it's not it's based on

282.58 --> 286.539
eugenics that oh yeah there may be

284.139 --> 289.66
something to it but doesn't mean that

286.539 --> 292.57
behavioral studies have no legitimacy

289.66 --> 294.61
whatsoever because people have specific

292.57 --> 297.37
types of behavior and everyone has

294.61 --> 300.099
certain levels of normal behavior what

297.37 --> 303.099
is considered normal behavior and then

300.099 --> 305.8
if you have specific types of persistent

303.099 --> 309.25
deviations from that behavior then it

305.8 --> 313.42
just becomes classified and the things

309.25 --> 316.03
that out of a certain setting of

313.42 --> 321.43
shanell 'ti disorders at normal

316.03 --> 327.53999999999996
behaviors became defined as psychopathic

321.43 --> 330.46
or sociopathic and I yeah I'm not I

327.54 --> 333.58000000000004
don't use these words very lightly I

330.46 --> 335.59
tried to use them less and less lightly

333.58 --> 337.96
and try especially not in moments of

335.59 --> 344.71
rage to throw them out unless I have

337.96 --> 346.65999999999997
very instinctual signs that even though

344.71 --> 349.27
I don't have the full picture yet that

346.66 --> 351.64000000000004
is a big chance and then as soon as I

349.27 --> 355.39
would find out to the contrary I would

351.64 --> 359.38
retract such statements and kind of half

355.39 --> 361.03
because hey before say last year there

359.38 --> 363.94
are some people that I would call

361.03 --> 365.85999999999996
psychopaths all of a sudden because of

363.94 --> 372.19
the certain extreme switch of their

365.86 --> 374.92
behavior but yeah then eventually they

372.19 --> 378.07
still fall back on their personal thing

374.92 --> 380.77000000000004
of still wanting some level of common

378.07 --> 384.61
decency and now what that common decency

380.77 --> 387.96999999999997
really is that is what shows that is

384.61 --> 393.58000000000004
what shows if it's natural or not so for

387.97 --> 398.62
example Jose yeah we know Jose as Jose

393.58 --> 401.14
has certain issues he has well he is a

398.62 --> 404.89
human being still and he does have

401.14 --> 407.89
genuine feelings and he can distinguish

404.89 --> 410.97999999999996
between the normal spectrum range of

407.89 --> 414.82
feelings naturally from within now how

410.98 --> 416.56
he deals with that can be difficult to

414.82 --> 421.05
him sometimes I didn't want to poopoo or

416.56 --> 423.91
anything eight so I think he knows it he

421.05 --> 427.75
really wants to be a better person

423.91 --> 429.72
deep inside so he can't really be

427.75 --> 434.22
classified in that direction however

429.72 --> 438.13000000000005
another type of individual they will

434.22 --> 441.13000000000005
claim that certain types of common

438.13 --> 443.77
decency or be a defender of free speech

441.13 --> 447.73
and how important that is but if you

443.77 --> 451.69
really look at to what the feelings

447.73 --> 454.15000000000003
that doesn't really make any sense it

451.69 --> 456.85
seems like it's more an image an act

454.15 --> 459.76
that they want to be seen they want to

456.85 --> 463.42
be associated with that but their acts

459.76 --> 465.4
don't really prove that because if you

463.42 --> 466.0
were for example genuinely for free

465.4 --> 473.22999999999996
speech

466.0 --> 478.63
you wouldn't do what what ranty did

473.23 --> 481.18
yesterday you wouldn't because I asked

478.63 --> 485.05
him specifically not to I look I talked

481.18 --> 487.36
with ranty even after the the clashes of

485.05 --> 489.61
last time I kind of yeah yesterday

487.36 --> 492.25
proved it like I let him on my show I

489.61 --> 495.7
thought like okay I guess he's gonna

492.25 --> 500.11
behave now I hope he stays that way but

495.7 --> 503.46999999999997
yeah how how quick how quick he goes

500.11 --> 506.83000000000004
through all that so all that credit just

503.47 --> 508.66
threw it all down the garbage can cause

506.83 --> 512.59
he thought it was funny and he he

508.66 --> 515.74
thought that his freedom to express his

512.59 --> 519.52
feelings about how funny it was was more

515.74 --> 521.67
important than coming across as a decent

519.52 --> 527.53
human being

521.67 --> 531.31
now what fuels that it what fuels into

527.53 --> 537.99
that is not having a natural instinct as

531.31 --> 537.9899999999999
to prioritize social behavior

544.17 --> 546.8299999999999
so

547.21 --> 554.58
and I think a lot of people do just

551.22 --> 554.58
realize this

555.96 --> 561.87
and it is very sad it every about this

559.44 --> 565.5
you know I'm not pissed off even at

561.87 --> 569.279
Randy I'm just really disappointed so

565.5 --> 572.52
sad thought he could get over it over

569.279 --> 578.24
his weird little self-destructing

572.52 --> 585.51
impulses that he just wants to give into

578.24 --> 590.1800000000001
no no he he wants to abuse people's

585.51 --> 593.33
openness to dangle out very tense

590.18 --> 596.7299999999999
moments that have a very specific

593.33 --> 602.149
context and target it was even specific

596.73 --> 607.83
in between the the outburst of 82 I

602.149 --> 610.29
reflected upon this many times and it's

607.83 --> 612.149
a jarring moment and I regret it

610.29 --> 614.64
sometimes but on the other hand yeah

612.149 --> 617.72
that was it is genuine that is all real

614.64 --> 620.04
and if you think that that is funny

617.72 --> 625.529
there's something seriously wrong with

620.04 --> 628.41
you because it is genuine expression of

625.529 --> 633.3
suffering genuine suffering and very

628.41 --> 635.67
real things in the world it's not funny

633.3 --> 640.2199999999999
if you think that's funny then that is

635.67 --> 640.2199999999999
like a very scary sign of psychopathy

640.91 --> 651.8
I'm sorry not saying that he is but it

645.779 --> 651.8
is definitely looking like that

655.44 --> 663.61
[Music]

658.44 --> 669.37
cookie yeah well you know there's some

663.61 --> 672.37
help I could use because I want to know

669.37 --> 676.63
if I can do something more effective

672.37 --> 678.28
than just flag videos and some are

676.63 --> 684.64
really bad and they do actually get

678.28 --> 687.37
taken down but hey if I need to put more

684.64 --> 688.99
judicial pressure in some way I need to

687.37 --> 692.86
be informed about this and I can

688.99 --> 694.6
definitely use help in understanding how

692.86 --> 696.16
it works and it's been problematic

694.6 --> 698.59
because I live in the Netherlands so in

696.16 --> 702.9699999999999
my book very differently from England or

698.59 --> 706.8100000000001
the United States but yeah you know this

702.97 --> 709.27
I simply don't want that video to be

706.81 --> 712.2099999999999
taken out of context if somebody's going

709.27 --> 715.54
to take clips of the genuine rage

712.21 --> 719.64
outbursts Savage and they were savage

715.54 --> 723.5999999999999
right but they were not they were not

719.64 --> 727.66
psychotic because that's that's genuine

723.6 --> 730.75
urge it's it's genuine because yeah if

727.66 --> 734.73
at some point and that that was the pre

730.75 --> 740.02
setting of it really at some point just

734.73 --> 743.26
blatant atrocities and and just benign

740.02 --> 744.9
hatred of children and if that just

743.26 --> 746.95
roams free and you could imagine

744.9 --> 749.79
disgusting things like people being

746.95 --> 753.85
children being sacrificed in the streets

749.79 --> 758.1999999999999
bloody spectacle yeah that's exactly the

753.85 --> 760.9
response and that's real and that should

758.2 --> 764.32
be the response if you're a human being

760.9 --> 767.1
if you're not a robot deprived of all

764.32 --> 767.1
humanity

768.57 --> 772.2800000000001
and that's what that's about so if

770.4 --> 775.5
somebody's gonna take a piece of that

772.28 --> 778.9499999999999
and then think oh it's so funny or say

775.5 --> 779.43
oh look oh you're just gonna do that to

778.95 --> 784.5600000000001
anyone

779.43 --> 791.0899999999999
oh you're you're a monster that is so

784.56 --> 791.0899999999999
beyond moral that is so evil to do that

791.84 --> 799.59
and it's not enough to just let that be

797.76 --> 800.91
known by people because hey there's

799.59 --> 802.95
gonna be people out there that I've

800.91 --> 805.35
never seen me before and this is this is

802.95 --> 807.6
kind of the bigger problem so I grow if

805.35 --> 810.0600000000001
that [ __ ] is gonna be dangled out there

807.6 --> 813.51
out of context without even me knowing

810.06 --> 815.9399999999999
it's there then it's gonna have a shock

813.51 --> 819.08
reaction like a very high suspicion

815.94 --> 821.73
reaction from people for a long period

819.08 --> 826.2
it's gonna fend off a lot of people and

821.73 --> 831.51
ranty is literally handing that [ __ ] to

826.2 --> 834.62
the Beast to the Satan system by doing

831.51 --> 838.91
what he's doing making fun of that

834.62 --> 842.46
forwarding that out of context it's evil

838.91 --> 846.75
blatantly evil and I wish that [ __ ]

842.46 --> 849.4200000000001
could be taken down like quickly and if

846.75 --> 852.81
I need to go and copy write the entire

849.42 --> 856.9499999999999
82 episode every aspect of it or at

852.81 --> 860.64
least the violent parts the apparent

856.95 --> 863.5500000000001
violent parts then yeah I will do it and

860.64 --> 866.79
it's kind of sad in a way because I

863.55 --> 871.05
don't like censorship but if people are

866.79 --> 874.1999999999999
not gonna take this thing copy it if

871.05 --> 876.7099999999999
they're not pretty much gonna intend to

874.2 --> 880.11
take it out of context to black me

876.71 --> 881.7900000000001
blacken my image so because otherwise

880.11 --> 883.5
people would talk about it they would

881.79 --> 885.0899999999999
point at it if they had something

883.5 --> 887.82
sensible to say they would just talk

885.09 --> 890.25
about they wouldn't show it so maybe I

887.82 --> 895.4000000000001
should literally copyright that whole

890.25 --> 895.4
thing but I don't know how that works

896.24 --> 906.08
and I need judicial information I need

903.12 --> 906.08
some sources for this

907.11 --> 910.239
[Music]

913.88 --> 919.85
yeah yeah well I don't really care what

917.0 --> 923.93
baller trolls or any sock people out

919.85 --> 925.759
there are gonna tell me about how I

923.93 --> 931.16
should be responding to whatever

925.759 --> 933.769
happened you know so you can dish it

931.16 --> 936.85
what what it's normal that that

933.769 --> 939.98
individuals out there have monstrously

936.85 --> 942.1700000000001
out-of-context videos to make them look

939.98 --> 943.73
like maniacs out there what that's

942.17 --> 946.9699999999999
everybody should have that because

943.73 --> 949.25
nobody ever misbehaves and if then their

946.97 --> 951.019
video is put on the Internet it's not

949.25 --> 952.61
like their entire lives can be made

951.019 --> 955.1
completely miserable

952.61 --> 958.37
they wouldn't even be public Internet

955.1 --> 960.589
characters you know no actually no

958.37 --> 964.699
there's there's something to doing

960.589 --> 966.769
something about that because this is not

964.699 --> 971.5
about freedom of speech it's about

966.769 --> 978.23
protecting people from being slandered

971.5 --> 980.569
that's what it is we're talking about

978.23 --> 986.1800000000001
eighty-two flat earth early-bird

980.569 --> 988.9699999999999
eighty-two life an episode where I was

986.18 --> 991.04
feeling really bad really really bad

988.97 --> 993.9490000000001
because I was getting flooded from all

991.04 --> 995.81
sides from the media from everywhere

993.949 --> 998.0889999999999
everywhere I was talking everyone was

995.81 --> 1002.3389999999999
talking about this [ __ ] and just getting

998.089 --> 1005.589
overboard about freaking vampire elites

1002.339 --> 1008.35
raping and torturing and murdering and

1005.589 --> 1011.139
consuming children okay

1008.35 --> 1012.6990000000001
it was so overwhelming that I just

1011.139 --> 1014.649
couldn't and I went berserk

1012.699 --> 1016.7199999999999
I was literally angry at the entire

1014.649 --> 1019.689
world like how dare you shove that [ __ ]

1016.72 --> 1020.769
in my face and leave it there and not do

1019.689 --> 1024.779
something about it

1020.769 --> 1024.779
that's what it was

1029.55 --> 1032.7
[Music]

1033.329 --> 1040.239
yeah yeah that one Zep tepi

1037.119 --> 1040.2389999999998
[Music]

1044.19 --> 1049.8600000000001
yeah vampire is more the colloquial

1047.22 --> 1055.89
stamp you can put on as in the vampire

1049.86 --> 1062.09
mindset behavior and consequences the

1055.89 --> 1062.0900000000001
format that is what I was talking about

1063.65 --> 1071.97
the image of the absolute but

1067.17 --> 1077.01
presupposed monsters of yeah that are in

1071.97 --> 1079.41
control and use pure horror and sin to

1077.01 --> 1084.41
control everything and to try to attain

1079.41 --> 1084.41
some satanic power that

1091.11 --> 1101.9089999999999
so that's so funny that's so funny yeah

1097.85 --> 1103.9189999999999
yeah well I will freaking I will do

1101.909 --> 1107.3990000000001
whatever is necessary with that [ __ ] you

1103.919 --> 1111.179
know I know you guys are just gonna copy

1107.399 --> 1115.529
paste and get and make it even worse I

1111.179 --> 1120.0590000000002
know you will because I've been stalked

1115.529 --> 1124.44
and haunted by absolute Psychopaths all

1120.059 --> 1129.96
my life all my life every social

1124.44 --> 1133.26
situation they just pop up their demonic

1129.96 --> 1136.23
little eyes open as they see me pass

1133.26 --> 1140.25
from the light that radiates from me and

1136.23 --> 1145.1100000000001
they start haunting me it's happened all

1140.25 --> 1147.659
my life and there's nothing I've ever

1145.11 --> 1151.11
been able to do anything to do about it

1147.659 --> 1153.45
it's like I live in the matrix and just

1151.11 --> 1154.649
these agent Smith's just wake up and

1153.45 --> 1159.3600000000001
start haunting me

1154.649 --> 1163.2299999999998
everywhere everywhere I go literally

1159.36 --> 1166.35
it's like that and they never stop and

1163.23 --> 1169.289
they're strong they're very persistent

1166.35 --> 1172.279
in their application of what they want

1169.289 --> 1176.51
to do and achieve subconsciously I think

1172.279 --> 1176.51
because that's what they are

1184.58 --> 1191.059
yeah well Zep tepi Thanks thanks for

1187.099 --> 1193.729
that yeah I don't I don't want that [ __ ]

1191.059 --> 1197.4189999999999
to be circling out there I don't want to

1193.729 --> 1200.599
be made into some freaking evil guy

1197.419 --> 1207.919
stereotype because that is absolute an

1200.599 --> 1211.039
abomination to what I really am but I

1207.919 --> 1213.6490000000001
know the world will do it anyway cuz hey

1211.039 --> 1217.9089999999999
I speak the truth

1213.649 --> 1223.849
unabated I'm a flat earther I believe in

1217.909 --> 1228.159
creation I feel God and I trust my

1223.849 --> 1230.899
senses and I follow the path I follow

1228.159 --> 1232.94
purity as much as I can I keep on

1230.899 --> 1236.2089999999998
learning and I have a lot of mental

1232.94 --> 1239.059
skill and sensitivity and all this

1236.209 --> 1242.179
combination allows me to do what I do

1239.059 --> 1244.489
and I feel that I must do it but as I

1242.179 --> 1247.009
keep on doing it the darkness surrounds

1244.489 --> 1250.009
me and I talk about it it's moths to the

1247.009 --> 1255.289
flame and you see it's not a joke it

1250.009 --> 1258.799
really isn't I am really getting haunted

1255.289 --> 1261.529
by Psychopaths my entire life and they

1258.799 --> 1263.69
don't they don't psychopaths are not

1261.529 --> 1267.079
necessarily the Gulu serial killers

1263.69 --> 1270.079
although yeah well aware that at some

1267.079 --> 1275.059
point I may actually be encountering

1270.079 --> 1277.7
that kind of [ __ ] but it's usually just

1275.059 --> 1280.399
the more basic people and besides most

1277.7 --> 1281.989
psychopaths are so careful there because

1280.399 --> 1283.9089999999999
they don't have all their senses that

1281.989 --> 1288.3790000000001
they tend to also be cowardice and

1283.909 --> 1290.8090000000002
that's I guess in in my advantage but

1288.379 --> 1297.019
they haunt me all my life everywhere I

1290.809 --> 1300.579
go on schools went out when I tried to

1297.019 --> 1300.579
engage with society

1300.69 --> 1309.96
in the social media it's everywhere it

1306.0 --> 1311.97
is in people and it has become part of a

1309.96 --> 1313.3500000000001
lot of people in their subconscious and

1311.97 --> 1316.8600000000001
they don't know how to deal with it and

1313.35 --> 1319.05
then when it's called a pom they have no

1316.86 --> 1321.1499999999999
control of it and they surrender to it

1319.05 --> 1323.94
for as long as it lasts

1321.15 --> 1328.02
it's literally like an agent hits them

1323.94 --> 1330.78
and they they have not been taught what

1328.02 --> 1332.46
this is how to deal with this probably

1330.78 --> 1334.02
no but no parents of them ever

1332.46 --> 1337.02
confronted them with it

1334.02 --> 1340.74
they were probably fooled into

1337.02 --> 1343.32
completely yeah into boomerang ignoring

1340.74 --> 1346.74
everything and just leaving their own

1343.32 --> 1351.1699999999998
kids to their own devices not learning

1346.74 --> 1351.17
about this this mechanism

1365.11 --> 1371.1699999999998
right yeah well cookie yeah no but

1368.41 --> 1372.6100000000001
that's fine you know he thinks it's he

1371.17 --> 1375.8200000000002
is a psychopath

1372.61 --> 1376.8
because cookie is probably ratty pretty

1375.82 --> 1380.4099999999999
sure it is

1376.8 --> 1383.95
somebody associated somebody's the same

1380.41 --> 1386.02
level so it's like why it's a genuine

1383.95 --> 1390.28
question he doesn't understand why he

1386.02 --> 1395.65
thinks that me thinking Brenda going

1390.28 --> 1399.1
berserk is funny is on the same level as

1395.65 --> 1403.48
me on my own show going completely

1399.1 --> 1406.09
apeshit against monsters like were

1403.48 --> 1407.5
literal monsters presupposed monsters

1406.09 --> 1410.11
that would be out there and were talked

1407.5 --> 1413.2
about widely on the media what's the

1410.11 --> 1416.4399999999998
difference because he does not know he

1413.2 --> 1420.7
does not know it's not a joke it's not a

1416.44 --> 1423.22
job it doesn't know what's the

1420.7 --> 1428.6200000000001
difference well I can tell you the

1423.22 --> 1433.78
difference Brenda okay was triggered

1428.62 --> 1436.4499999999998
about the wrong pronoun about not being

1433.78 --> 1439.3799999999999
addressed as a woman as she wants to

1436.45 --> 1445.3600000000001
with her little social justice warrior

1439.38 --> 1449.7700000000002
thing and yeah that gets very serious

1445.36 --> 1452.4699999999998
but it's a face-to-face thing and it's

1449.77 --> 1455.05
ridiculous to start shouting at somebody

1452.47 --> 1456.52
when they do that face to face on rent

1455.05 --> 1459.0
is by the way it would typically allow

1456.52 --> 1462.4
this kind of [ __ ] because he loves to

1459.0 --> 1465.07
hurt people so I don't like that rant he

1462.4 --> 1468.1000000000001
did that but that Brenda then proceeded

1465.07 --> 1475.3
to respond like that and not just hang

1468.1 --> 1478.6299999999999
up was completely ridiculous now

1475.3 --> 1481.99
that was funny it was funny that it was

1478.63 --> 1486.5700000000002
such a ridiculous response now do you

1481.99 --> 1490.09
think that my brutal outrage against

1486.57 --> 1492.6699999999998
this idea that there are child murderers

1490.09 --> 1495.55
out there that pleasure themselves you

1492.67 --> 1498.46
know you think that my response was

1495.55 --> 1501.7
completely irrational it's like what a

1498.46 --> 1504.91
silly thing to do and you think that is

1501.7 --> 1512.49
on the same level you think that is on

1504.91 --> 1518.8600000000001
the same level then you got a serious

1512.49 --> 1526.75
sensory problem that's exactly what I'm

1518.86 --> 1528.34
talking about right well hm I I was

1526.75 --> 1532.84
being serious but it's it's not about

1528.34 --> 1536.4399999999998
ranty asking I specifically told him at

1532.84 --> 1539.47
least three or four times in his

1536.44 --> 1541.99
presence where he could hear me not to

1539.47 --> 1543.64
do it and he was like oh but I want to I

1541.99 --> 1546.16
want to be I think it's funny because he

1543.64 --> 1548.41
was suppressing that and I thought that

1546.16 --> 1550.51
he would be responsible enough to keep

1548.41 --> 1552.64
on suppressing that because it's wrong

1550.51 --> 1556.87
is wrong to even want that it is very

1552.64 --> 1559.8100000000002
creepy but he couldn't handle it but I

1556.87 --> 1562.27
told him specifically not to use it

1559.81 --> 1563.1699999999998
because it's not proper it's not the

1562.27 --> 1566.46
place for it

1563.17 --> 1571.75
and he did it anyway could he had to you

1566.46 --> 1574.63
because to him it is as funny as what

1571.75 --> 1577.69
Brenda dad it really is because he

1574.63 --> 1580.42
doesn't understand what real feelings

1577.69 --> 1583.78
are he just sees the amplitude of the

1580.42 --> 1586.24
actions doesn't understand the context

1583.78 --> 1589.77
doesn't have the senses for it

1586.24 --> 1589.77
it's very tragic

1590.62 --> 1601.6
do you understand it doesn't really

1598.76 --> 1605.059
matter why he thinks he do he does it

1601.6 --> 1607.279
p900 yeah it is nonsense there's no

1605.059 --> 1610.899
issue about it I was very thankful to

1607.279 --> 1613.25
him I didn't record it on the initial

1610.899 --> 1615.799
handing over and that was kind of

1613.25 --> 1618.32
because I was flustered and Nathan spoke

1615.799 --> 1623.84
about this there's nothing to get back

1618.32 --> 1629.029
for but I don't think he even really

1623.84 --> 1632.75
wanted to give that thing to me for

1629.029 --> 1635.63
genuine concerns no he wanted he I

1632.75 --> 1637.49
should have probably just rejected it

1635.63 --> 1639.98
but on the other hand yeah now I have a

1637.49 --> 1642.679
p900 and he was gonna stalk me anyway

1639.98 --> 1646.6100000000001
because he is what he is and he would be

1642.679 --> 1648.289
doing that he is doing that so it

1646.61 --> 1650.33
wouldn't have really mattered whether I

1648.289 --> 1651.98
take the camera or not you would have

1650.33 --> 1655.6999999999998
still proceeded to do what he does right

1651.98 --> 1657.88
now you know this because he can't help

1655.7 --> 1657.88
it

1667.419 --> 1672.909
oh really cookie I'm a hypocrite well

1670.57 --> 1674.1589999999999
you explained to me back what I just

1672.909 --> 1682.029
said

1674.159 --> 1690.729
no stop timing him out I just addressed

1682.029 --> 1694.419
him look he's already there

1690.729 --> 1696.82
nobody needs to be timed out repeatedly

1694.419 --> 1704.8490000000002
I'll take care of him if he's really

1696.82 --> 1708.789
gonna just stand there baseline trolling

1704.849 --> 1712.869
without any kind of genuine inquiry then

1708.789 --> 1715.889
I'll just ban him just leave it there

1712.869 --> 1722.32
sock trolls and go ahead but this guy is

1715.889 --> 1725.6789999999999
addressing me so it's okay Amanda young

1722.32 --> 1729.6689999999999
just be careful with the wrenching here

1725.679 --> 1734.019
this is a serious situation and this is

1729.669 --> 1736.69
I'm genuinely addressing a certain group

1734.019 --> 1739.119
of people and everyone else to try to

1736.69 --> 1743.079
make spread some awareness as to what is

1739.119 --> 1747.089
going on what types of people are out

1743.079 --> 1747.089
there and how confusing they can be

1752.69 --> 1757.039
[Music]

1772.33 --> 1778.1999999999998
oh okay well Keith Richard sure

1780.2 --> 1785.3790000000001
are you aware though what I'm really

1782.72 --> 1785.3790000000001
talking about

1804.71 --> 1811.97
right I know hm well you're don't worry

1808.1 --> 1818.269
you're not falling into the category you

1811.97 --> 1820.369
know because if you have control over

1818.269 --> 1822.769
your impulses and you want to throw out

1820.369 --> 1826.009
what is inside because they're real

1822.769 --> 1829.249
feelings that's something else that's

1826.009 --> 1830.96
more impulse control and yeah there's a

1829.249 --> 1833.96
lot of people that have that too I have

1830.96 --> 1836.69
certain issues fr at least had a lot of

1833.96 --> 1839.74
issues with that myself not so much

1836.69 --> 1845.45
anymore I think much more discipline now

1839.74 --> 1847.639
concerning what I put out there but

1845.45 --> 1849.8300000000002
that's not the same thing as individuals

1847.639 --> 1853.7589999999998
out there that literally just stalk me

1849.83 --> 1856.279
and and try to get me off balance just

1853.759 --> 1861.769
try to disrupt my growth try to disrupt

1856.279 --> 1865.309
what I do distract me try to extract

1861.769 --> 1870.47
things from me to then put out a straw

1865.309 --> 1872.59
man of me and make me look ugly or use

1870.47 --> 1876.2
me as some kind of black sheep target

1872.59 --> 1878.83
it's happened all my life and you're not

1876.2 --> 1878.8300000000002
doing that again

1881.38 --> 1886.0100000000002
right and you are man enough to say

1883.94 --> 1888.3500000000001
sorry that's also big thing yet and that

1886.01 --> 1891.169
is it's one of the things that I even

1888.35 --> 1894.8899999999999
forget about Randy

1891.169 --> 1897.76
he never apologizes he's never done it

1894.89 --> 1897.76
not once

1932.6 --> 1935.289
all right

1940.66 --> 1946.41
it's no stars it does that's ridiculous

1974.0 --> 1981.91
oh yeah is that a P yes yeah you totally

1979.16 --> 1984.77
hit it the nail on the head

1981.91 --> 1986.8400000000001
except a piece ed you think he had it

1984.77 --> 1988.76
planned and that he joined your show

1986.84 --> 1992.05
yesterday to kind of lead you into fall

1988.76 --> 1996.32
security yes that is exactly what he did

1992.05 --> 1998.78
and I even felt the preliminaries of it

1996.32 --> 2001.54
but I was just gonna say well no matter

1998.78 --> 2009.24
how it turns out I'm just gonna be good

2001.54 --> 2012.6399999999999
because hey I haven't done anything evil

2009.24 --> 2017.83
there's no blame here left because of

2012.64 --> 2022.15
Randy's action so and I reflect back on

2017.83 --> 2024.73
to the debate so yeah what he did he

2022.15 --> 2028.18
basically did to himself and yeah it is

2024.73 --> 2031.6
a burden to me in a way in an indirect

2028.18 --> 2034.54
way but in a more direct way it's just

2031.6 --> 2036.8999999999999
showing off what type of guy he really

2034.54 --> 2036.8999999999999
is

2047.28 --> 2054.52
now the Thank You AGM yeah I do think

2050.38 --> 2057.25
that I will have a great year it's going

2054.52 --> 2059.29
to be a very interesting year it's also

2057.25 --> 2063.58
a year my GTI is going to be completed

2059.29 --> 2065.2
guaranteed guaranteed probably even

2063.58 --> 2069.34
before the summer time it's going to be

2065.2 --> 2071.89
very interesting and who knows what else

2069.34 --> 2077.8900000000003
is gonna happen whether I'm gonna be

2071.89 --> 2085.48
active on D live or I don't know what

2077.89 --> 2088.0299999999997
I'm gonna change the show we'll see

2085.48 --> 2092.26
let's see where it goes we'll see how

2088.03 --> 2095.23
much energy this show will still retain

2092.26 --> 2097.8700000000003
and if it is still yeah good enough to

2095.23 --> 2100.9900000000002
keep on going I don't know for sure I

2097.87 --> 2103.5699999999997
try to do my best but yeah it's not

2100.99 --> 2106.12
perfect it's and I think this shows not

2103.57 --> 2111.79
the most entertaining show to watch but

2106.12 --> 2113.92
yeah sometimes it is kind of I really do

2111.79 --> 2115.92
wish I would be able to use some more

2113.92 --> 2118.36
music though

2115.92 --> 2120.4900000000002
but yeah my music tastes are very

2118.36 --> 2123.04
specific and I'm pretty sure those types

2120.49 --> 2126.6099999999997
of music will class me cause me to get

2123.04 --> 2128.56
flagged a copyright flagged just like

2126.61 --> 2136.33
Laura using Lord of the Rings things

2128.56 --> 2140.17
so what be great if I could somehow get

2136.33 --> 2141.97
a deal not to get copyrighted for a very

2140.17 --> 2147.79
specific music source I wonder how that

2141.97 --> 2150.2799999999997
works because I yeah inserting certain

2147.79 --> 2157.35
music that that would work great for me

2150.28 --> 2157.3500000000004
I have a vast range of good songs

2158.56 --> 2165.95
very technologically advanced sounding

2161.96 --> 2169.25
and well crafted like in a composition

2165.95 --> 2172.2799999999997
way songs and I wish I could use that

2169.25 --> 2175.16
kind of let it rub off on me as it has

2172.28 --> 2177.5600000000004
while I listened to it on my own time I

2175.16 --> 2179.8399999999997
really enjoy those songs I very often

2177.56 --> 2182.7799999999997
listen those songs right before I start

2179.84 --> 2186.6800000000003
up the show to help me also get into the

2182.78 --> 2193.46
moment but we'll know we'll see where it

2186.68 --> 2198.0699999999997
goes what I can do what I could do what

2193.46 --> 2198.07
I could assimilate in my in my works

2203.76 --> 2211.1400000000003
no not into Johnny Cash now look like

2208.859 --> 2213.0
the the golden all these are what it

2211.14 --> 2216.6
whatever yeah that's really nice it's

2213.0 --> 2219.9
kind of you can use that but I don't

2216.6 --> 2222.0
want to use no music because it's known

2219.9 --> 2226.7400000000002
and because it's free or whatever no I

2222.0 --> 2231.93
want to use the songs that I love I want

2226.74 --> 2237.06
to use them and well in the more recent

2231.93 --> 2239.2799999999997
years that has become music from a very

2237.06 --> 2242.64
specific channel now who's been relaying

2239.28 --> 2254.09
music from other from several artists

2242.64 --> 2254.0899999999997
and that is the call again where is it

2255.809 --> 2266.739
yeah the the grand sound Channel and

2263.799 --> 2268.509
they have category of deep house and not

2266.739 --> 2274.589
everything on there is great but I found

2268.509 --> 2279.339
many many as in the years 20 fantasy

2274.589 --> 2284.41
echo songs just really intense and

2279.339 --> 2290.319
personal and mysterious and just skilled

2284.41 --> 2292.029
and I love that [ __ ] so I wish I could

2290.319 --> 2298.15
use some of that music for my shows

2292.029 --> 2301.72
maybe as an intro song as I go or like a

2298.15 --> 2304.96
break moment or something like that that

2301.72 --> 2307.2099999999996
would be fantastic and I wonder what

2304.96 --> 2309.9990000000003
yeah what I'll need to do in order to

2307.21 --> 2315.369
get that without getting yeah copyright

2309.999 --> 2321.839
claims I don't know I hope it won't cost

2315.369 --> 2321.839
a lot of money to do that we'll see

2335.18 --> 2342.1699999999996
of course Marcel molineres we're already

2337.76 --> 2345.5
progressing yeah maybe the empirical

2342.17 --> 2349.46
research has become kind of saturated

2345.5 --> 2352.94
now the things that lie beforehand for

2349.46 --> 2356.02
us to do as Flat Earth researches as far

2352.94 --> 2359.87
as empirical gathering empirical data

2356.02 --> 2362.54
yeah that is kind of saturate it is it

2359.87 --> 2365.75
is kind of already saturated this may be

2362.54 --> 2367.52
slightly 8 we can always do more more

2365.75 --> 2369.62
and more more and more and more examples

2367.52 --> 2372.11
more examples to just keep on hammering

2369.62 --> 2374.2
it but it is pretty much the research

2372.11 --> 2378.65
part it seems to be kind of saturated

2374.2 --> 2386.0
however there's another part also going

2378.65 --> 2387.65
down and that is the actual using of the

2386.0 --> 2391.37
preponderance of evidence of our

2387.65 --> 2394.61
research and our findings discoveries of

2391.37 --> 2397.49
the lies and machinations to push back

2394.61 --> 2400.3
against the system potentially in a

2397.49 --> 2408.2299999999996
judicial way maybe involving schools

2400.3 --> 2411.1400000000003
this is gonna be the new reagent really

2408.23 --> 2414.53
dig into and it's not gonna be without

2411.14 --> 2417.89
hazards though it's bound to be riddled

2414.53 --> 2420.44
with frauds trying to do other things

2417.89 --> 2422.93
trying to use it as a cover for their

2420.44 --> 2426.62
own political agendas yeah that [ __ ] all

2422.93 --> 2430.1299999999997
of it but there is a push from the Flat

2426.62 --> 2434.9
Earth now not just in empirical research

2430.13 --> 2439.31
but in judicial inquiry and actually

2434.9 --> 2443.03
getting just provable errors out of the

2439.31 --> 2446.5099999999998
system concerning flag lobe Earth

2443.03 --> 2450.28
assumptions and teachings so that is

2446.51 --> 2450.28
something that there will be progress in

2453.46 --> 2458.239
[Music]

2461.58 --> 2465.2999999999997
we want cookie

2477.02 --> 2485.18
right yeah cookie yeah I know I know

2480.35 --> 2490.8199999999997
cookie I know cookie I know I know I

2485.18 --> 2493.91
know I know I know you think that Brenda

2490.82 --> 2497.36
just being pissed off and me getting

2493.91 --> 2501.0499999999997
into violent rage fit because of child

2497.36 --> 2503.0
murdering and torture that that is on

2501.05 --> 2506.1800000000003
the same level it's just like yeah it's

2503.0 --> 2508.64
just rates it's just funny but people

2506.18 --> 2511.3399999999997
that have souls that have actual moral

2508.64 --> 2513.5899999999997
compasses don't feel the same way so you

2511.34 --> 2515.9
can stop reminding me about that now if

2513.59 --> 2518.23
you don't get this you got a serious

2515.9 --> 2518.23
issue

2552.539 --> 2560.6690000000003
yeah well big chunga's that's an

2556.739 --> 2564.689
interesting concept wonder if it'll work

2560.669 --> 2568.109
though because as I said a lot of what

2564.689 --> 2570.3289999999997
keeps the globe in place is the

2568.109 --> 2574.069
structure and the groups and the

2570.329 --> 2577.619
connections within the justice system

2574.069 --> 2580.229
also originally at least I don't know

2577.619 --> 2582.3900000000003
how it shifted right I'm not really too

2580.229 --> 2586.799
aware of what is going down in all those

2582.39 --> 2590.249
circles for real but before we start a

2586.799 --> 2593.009
school first there has to be judicial

2590.249 --> 2596.4889999999996
inquiry in order to correct things and

2593.009 --> 2599.449
then it wants those safety the truth

2596.489 --> 2602.4
safety things are in place then

2599.449 --> 2605.579
potentially somebody could good start

2602.4 --> 2609.4100000000003
like officially a flatter school because

2605.579 --> 2612.3900000000003
then the grounds would be safe for that

2609.41 --> 2613.5589999999997
that's how it works but it's it's not

2612.39 --> 2616.339
even a bad idea

2613.559 --> 2616.3390000000004
make jungus

2621.96 --> 2631.8
what what cookie my cookie doesn't think

2627.96 --> 2635.25
they are the same they're very different

2631.8 --> 2640.01
but he thinks that I am attributing my

2635.25 --> 2644.97
own rules to Randy show my own rules no

2640.01 --> 2648.6200000000003
look that's the issue attributing what

2644.97 --> 2651.93
my rules of normal human non

2648.62 --> 2656.0699999999997
psychopathic social behavior yeah

2651.93 --> 2659.1
but that's not my rules that's the

2656.07 --> 2664.38
unspoken rule of humanity it is the

2659.1 --> 2665.0699999999997
instinct that is with us you can't be

2664.38 --> 2669.1800000000003
serious

2665.07 --> 2672.36
how is that my rules yeah I abide by

2669.18 --> 2684.96
those natural rules yeah those rules of

2672.36 --> 2689.25
nature it's just that if Randy wouldn't

2684.96 --> 2692.4900000000002
have done it then I don't know his is

2689.25 --> 2695.19
kind of like clown show with rage would

2692.49 --> 2697.89
have them haven't been that abominable

2695.19 --> 2703.23
it wouldn't have been half bad now it's

2697.89 --> 2707.67
just a totem to a freaking psychopath he

2703.23 --> 2710.22
ruined it he yeah he flew through bad

2707.67 --> 2712.41
blood in the works and now it's just

2710.22 --> 2713.8199999999997
tainted and only people that don't see

2712.41 --> 2716.46
the difference with the taint

2713.82 --> 2722.61
will think it's funny and the rest will

2716.46 --> 2724.65
just think it's very distasteful so he

2722.61 --> 2726.98
literally is just shooting himself in

2724.65 --> 2726.98
the foot

2727.99 --> 2731.14
[Music]

2732.79 --> 2746.0
really cookie so you think that my my my

2741.83 --> 2750.2599999999998
genuine outrage and monstrous attitude

2746.0 --> 2754.869
towards child murderers and torturers

2750.26 --> 2758.3900000000003
and rapists that are pre supposed to

2754.869 --> 2760.8500000000004
absolutely love it and be unrepented

2758.39 --> 2763.19
about it and have industrialized it

2760.85 --> 2767.14
throughout society right you think that

2763.19 --> 2770.53
my response to that and then saying I

2767.14 --> 2773.74
know that you think that is psychopathic

2770.53 --> 2777.3500000000004
really you think that a psychopath would

2773.74 --> 2780.6189999999997
do that in response to that no no it's

2777.35 --> 2782.39
exactly the opposite because Psychopaths

2780.619 --> 2784.76
don't care about that

2782.39 --> 2787.97
I think they probably think it's funny

2784.76 --> 2791.78
or they don't care no you got it all

2787.97 --> 2794.359
switched around typical it's the first

2791.78 --> 2798.13
world it's very convenient very easy

2794.359 --> 2800.45
because in these very tough moral

2798.13 --> 2802.2200000000003
conflicting situation there's a lot of

2800.45 --> 2805.39
people that have trouble really making

2802.22 --> 2808.1299999999997
sense of what is what which one is it

2805.39 --> 2810.3799999999997
yeah and and they know it the

2808.13 --> 2813.23
psychopaths know it they'd like to be in

2810.38 --> 2816.6800000000003
control of situations or whatever and

2813.23 --> 2819.859
they play with it they do flip a rug

2816.68 --> 2822.29
because it can - a lot of people

2819.859 --> 2824.7799999999997
actually work they can fall for the

2822.29 --> 2826.94
trick and think oh my god this Arwen guy

2824.78 --> 2827.57
he's a monster he's just kind of murder

2826.94 --> 2830.54
people

2827.57 --> 2836.119
no no that's because it's taken out of

2830.54 --> 2838.52
context but yeah well they know well

2836.119 --> 2841.52
they find that out well they go and

2838.52 --> 2847.94
watch this episode in response to that

2841.52 --> 2850.6
maybe I hope so because this is really a

2847.94 --> 2850.6
response

2856.76 --> 2859.889
[Music]

2874.68 --> 2882.06
really pointage what tell me what is the

2879.21 --> 2886.65
stupid that I combine with genius in a

2882.06 --> 2890.64
magical way right yeah you're using that

2886.65 --> 2899.28
word so can you be more specific

2890.64 --> 2903.5
fine each what did you just had to use

2899.28 --> 2908.13
that that moment just just just a little

2903.5 --> 2916.65
little globe nasty poke you had to do it

2908.13 --> 2920.03
was that it really poor timing it's

2916.65 --> 2920.03
really poor timing for niche

2927.39 --> 2930.489
[Music]

2935.599 --> 2939.949
well I'm assuming at this moment that it

2938.239 --> 2943.309
is because I don't know what else I'm

2939.949 --> 2945.289
supposedly stupid about Voynich but hey

2943.309 --> 2947.7690000000002
you said you will tell me so why don't

2945.289 --> 2947.7690000000002
you tell me

2970.58 --> 2977.47
now I don't want to hear that you're

2972.41 --> 2977.47
willing to tell me tell me in chat go

2978.64 --> 2987.49
you tell me what is stupid what is this

2982.07 --> 2987.4900000000002
stupid that I combined with genius go

2991.0 --> 2996.31
[Music]

2998.24 --> 3005.08
because unless you got something real

3000.51 --> 3007.57
I'm not I'm the basically gonna give you

3005.08 --> 3010.95
a little slap for projecting your own

3007.57 --> 3010.9500000000003
stupidity on me

3018.65 --> 3025.2490000000003
why why because I'm taking the entire

3021.319 --> 3027.619
sentence in your you think it's funny

3025.249 --> 3029.569
like stupid and genius and I get that

3027.619 --> 3034.339
you know stupid and genius can be funny

3029.569 --> 3038.269
but in this case where is it I don't

3034.339 --> 3042.589
like to be projected upon to by people

3038.269 --> 3046.24
with their stupid so why don't you tell

3042.589 --> 3046.24
me what was a stupid funny

3086.54 --> 3092.9
right okay no well point each that

3089.87 --> 3097.1
that's fine correcting yourself is also

3092.9 --> 3099.32
fine but you could have just said then I

3097.1 --> 3102.23
don't know where I got I just wanted to

3099.32 --> 3104.42
say that no be fine because I understand

3102.23 --> 3106.31
if you don't get where that came from I

3104.42 --> 3109.16
kind of do know where it came from and I

3106.31 --> 3112.1
think that my original assertion was

3109.16 --> 3114.1099999999997
probably on the target you it really it

3112.1 --> 3115.73
was the globe instinct you had to insert

3114.11 --> 3118.4900000000002
stupid in there even though you couldn't

3115.73 --> 3121.52
really put it into any real context you

3118.49 --> 3124.0899999999997
just had to insert that it's a globe

3121.52 --> 3124.09
instinct

3127.93 --> 3138.24
it's a little glob lling inside and just

3130.9 --> 3142.14
headed at having to reach out yeah

3138.24 --> 3142.14
that's all fine fine each

3156.22 --> 3165.54
that pointed you are a baller you are

3160.06 --> 3165.54
aren't you are you not

3183.36 --> 3185.9900000000002
right

3190.07 --> 3192.9700000000003
though he isn't

3198.319 --> 3206.229
okay yeah then I guess that my analysis

3201.559 --> 3211.3390000000004
of where that impulse came from is wrong

3206.229 --> 3215.239
well anyway yeah I guess it's very easy

3211.339 --> 3217.249
to assume you know in a sense Globus

3215.239 --> 3221.66
tend to be very predictable in their

3217.249 --> 3224.269
behavior so usually then I I might be

3221.66 --> 3226.0389999999998
inclined to believe somebody is a globe

3224.269 --> 3228.799
or rather pretending to be a flat

3226.039 --> 3231.1090000000004
earther more easily based on some

3228.799 --> 3242.779
frequency of behavior but I guess in

3231.109 --> 3247.91
this case it was just it was a bit on

3242.779 --> 3250.519
edge I could say because yeah I know I

3247.91 --> 3255.219
might sound very calm but in reality I'm

3250.519 --> 3255.2189999999996
still kind of pissed off because yeah

3257.469 --> 3266.299
I'm just being character attacked and I

3262.569 --> 3267.979
don't like that I never like that so it

3266.299 --> 3272.349
puts me a bit on it just sorry about

3267.979 --> 3272.3489999999997
that footage calling you globert

3285.539 --> 3295.3190000000004
no Cleary no Cleary ranty doesn't

3293.149 --> 3297.419
doesn't think I'm awesome

3295.319 --> 3301.229
he doesn't really want the best room you

3297.419 --> 3303.269
know he wants to control me because if

3301.229 --> 3307.249
he wanted the best for me he would leave

3303.269 --> 3310.3799999999997
me the [ __ ] alone and stop jabbing at me

3307.249 --> 3315.209
and he can't help himself he doesn't

3310.38 --> 3317.389
want the best to me think that you're

3315.209 --> 3317.3889999999997
wrong

3317.42 --> 3320.469
[Music]

3329.539 --> 3337.639
yeah JQ yeah Randy gave me the one not

3332.989 --> 3344.599
$1000 that's not even true right 400 max

3337.639 --> 3348.739
and his old gave it to me and the first

3344.599 --> 3351.0190000000002
thing he did after that was attack my

3348.739 --> 3356.299
character and say that I'm unthankful

3351.019 --> 3358.8799999999997
it's the first thing he did I think that

3356.299 --> 3361.329
that is a person that genuinely wants to

3358.88 --> 3361.329
help me

3373.83 --> 3381.24
oh yeah of course of course yeah that's

3377.16 --> 3385.02
that's why yeah it's I did something

3381.24 --> 3388.35
wrong and that justifies him haunting me

3385.02 --> 3396.45
and backstabbing me for no damn reason

3388.35 --> 3398.69
and being a miserable bastard no that

3396.45 --> 3398.6899999999996
doesn't

3405.64 --> 3412.5389999999998

3436.68 --> 3445.8999999999996
I'm not that camera is given and he

3442.029 --> 3449.549
doesn't care it's not about the freaking

3445.9 --> 3449.549
camera I can actually use it

3454.18 --> 3460.799

3481.48 --> 3488.29
jealous of whatever I don't give a [ __ ]

3483.37 --> 3493.45
I don't care what the reasons is I don't

3488.29 --> 3495.7
care why freakin psychos stalk me my

3493.45 --> 3500.49
entire life when no matter where I go I

3495.7 --> 3500.49
don't care what their motivation is

3521.68 --> 3526.1499999999996
ah yeah thank you michael roark almost

3524.349 --> 3529.4500000000003
forgot to mention it yeah I was on house

3526.15 --> 3533.049
days yesterday in the after show

3529.45 --> 3537.7
especially but I would got pretty heated

3533.049 --> 3541.089
up because yeah Georgie Georgie the lil

3537.7 --> 3543.18
creepy demon Goblin mmm yeah that's a

3541.089 --> 3546.97
word you're gonna be hearing a lot more

3543.18 --> 3549.7889999999998
George the little demon Goblin yeah he

3546.97 --> 3553.24
thought it was funny or some kind of

3549.789 --> 3556.75
good idea - in the middle of a an actual

3553.24 --> 3558.97
flat earth vs. globe earth argument to

3556.75 --> 3562.059
bring off like oh yeah are we why didn't

3558.97 --> 3563.74
you just stab somebody oh just a baby he

3562.059 --> 3567.8190000000004
thought that was a good idea so I

3563.74 --> 3572.9199999999996
absolutely mangled him Nathan Oakley

3567.819 --> 3574.42
style told him what sick little demon

3572.92 --> 3578.859
Goblin he really is

3574.42 --> 3582.94
career destroying psycho yeah doesn't

3578.859 --> 3584.38
have the senses to to just know when you

3582.94 --> 3586.7200000000003
shouldn't be saying certain things

3584.38 --> 3587.4100000000003
because he doesn't have the senses he's

3586.72 --> 3589.5389999999998
pathetic

3587.41 --> 3592.5099999999998
he's a little demon Goblin yeah I almost

3589.539 --> 3594.369
forgot about that yeah that was

3592.51 --> 3598.15
interesting and before that the whole

3594.369 --> 3600.01
satellite the satellite guy and the

3598.15 --> 3601.569
questions I asked yeah does anybody have

3600.01 --> 3604.63
an actual photograph of that satellite

3601.569 --> 3606.849
and oh you George why did you just go to

3604.63 --> 3609.67
this Institute this building and they

3606.849 --> 3613.7200000000003
will show you this special telescope oh

3609.67 --> 3615.52
it's not Rick at all oh really so

3613.72 --> 3618.9399999999996
something that should literally be

3615.52 --> 3623.319
visible from any point you know there's

3618.94 --> 3625.809
not a unique point where you can only

3623.319 --> 3627.3089999999997
see something that's going all the crust

3625.809 --> 3629.38
happens only there no you should

3627.309 --> 3633.2200000000003
literally be able to see it anywhere

3629.38 --> 3636.039
more than just a dot of light features

3633.22 --> 3638.3689999999997
good cameras telescopes whatever you

3636.039 --> 3644.1400000000003
want to use but not a preset thing a

3638.369 --> 3646.7200000000003
standard thing a real easy real product

3644.14 --> 3648.8489999999997
no machinations involved and just see it

3646.72 --> 3652.029
get that photograph well it doesn't

3648.849 --> 3653.75
exist there's none of that zero and they

3652.029 --> 3656.43
never addressed it

3653.75 --> 3658.62
yeck oh look here had it so lovely

3656.43 --> 3660.8999999999996
Howard more yet they us all they're all

3658.62 --> 3663.7799999999997
the data is there yeah I know that's

3660.9 --> 3666.9300000000003
exactly the story that everyone on the

3663.78 --> 3671.7900000000004
ball side says why don't you go and do

3666.93 --> 3674.1
that where do you go and do that if it's

3671.79 --> 3676.38
out there oh really it's out there why

3674.1 --> 3678.9
don't you shove it in my face then why

3676.38 --> 3681.35
don't you shove the confirmed sourced

3678.9 --> 3685.76
photograph of that satellite in space

3681.35 --> 3691.29
from Earth right not some CGI shitty

3685.76 --> 3693.5600000000004
faked photo thingy picture image but an

3691.29 --> 3697.23
actual photograph from Earth with

3693.56 --> 3702.45
discernible features from a satellite in

3697.23 --> 3703.95
the sky that is unedited an actual

3702.45 --> 3706.5299999999997
photograph now it's not there and so

3703.95 --> 3709.68
it's always you know the data it's all

3706.53 --> 3712.23
out there why don't you just go why

3709.68 --> 3714.72
don't you just search it doesn't sense

3712.23 --> 3717.0
well it's not my religion that I'm

3714.72 --> 3720.5099999999998
trying to prove you know I'm not the one

3717.0 --> 3722.64
actually in need of empirical proof that

3720.51 --> 3725.67
actual presuppose satellites are out

3722.64 --> 3729.72
there in orbit you know I don't care for

3725.67 --> 3731.73
that story I have no need to uphold that

3729.72 --> 3734.43
story because I have very viable

3731.73 --> 3736.85
alternatives that doesn't have to make

3734.43 --> 3743.8799999999997
me presuppose all kinds of nonsense

3736.85 --> 3747.33
right so yeah you find that photograph

3743.88 --> 3750.48
of a satellite in orbit and you shove

3747.33 --> 3756.12
that confirmed sourced photograph in my

3750.48 --> 3759.33
face ballers don't don't tell me to go

3756.12 --> 3761.79
and search it you search it you find it

3759.33 --> 3763.8199999999997
you source it you confirm it and you

3761.79 --> 3768.57
shove it in my face then I'll test you

3763.82 --> 3770.79
nobody's done this like yet the stories

3768.57 --> 3773.4300000000003
of satellites and the specialists oh

3770.79 --> 3776.96
look I've built a satellite or I know I

3773.43 --> 3779.73
know exactly about all the orbits oh

3776.96 --> 3781.5
yeah but where is that actual photograph

3779.73 --> 3784.02
of the satellite in orbit oh it's not

3781.5 --> 3785.93
there oh the proponents you have to go

3784.02 --> 3789.5
through the special station where they

3785.93 --> 3794.23
we'll show you know if it's out there it

3789.5 --> 3797.809
should be able to be photographed from

3794.23 --> 3801.47
the ground by people because it is

3797.809 --> 3804.05
visible well show me the photograph with

3801.47 --> 3809.839
discernible features of this satellite

3804.05 --> 3811.9700000000003
in orbit and yeah then you may have an

3809.839 --> 3815.869
actual argument beyond some fantasy

3811.97 --> 3818.5099999999998
story so anyway I'm running out the show

3815.869 --> 3824.9
