83.439 --> 88.24
quite beautiful it's been overall very

87.2 --> 90.07900000000001
sunny and

88.24 --> 91.28
beautiful clouds hang around but not

90.079 --> 94.079
really big ones

91.28 --> 94.07900000000001
like yesterday

94.799 --> 101.84
has been relatively dry still some

98.799 --> 105.04
water pools hanging around so it

101.84 --> 107.84
probably has rain somewhere in the night

105.04 --> 110.47900000000001
but it's really nice and there's not a

107.84 --> 110.479
lot of wind

112.24 --> 119.19999999999999
insects are going all over the place

115.28 --> 119.2
a lot of bees and bumblebees

119.68 --> 129.84
and sun is behind that cloud over there

136.319 --> 138.72
hello

140.08 --> 147.84

223.36 --> 227.76000000000002
i because i need it i think i made that

226.0 --> 231.92
point quite clear

227.76 --> 234.159
in a recent period but this way i am

231.92 --> 236.48
definitely getting around

234.159 --> 241.84
so thank you so much for the paypal

236.48 --> 241.84
support and keep it up

241.92 --> 249.51899999999998
ah yeah clutch barrett

246.159 --> 254.159
uh ro for rodriguez hello

249.519 --> 258.799
but yeah be normal that's crazy enough

254.159 --> 261.59999999999997
well it's like do normal act act normal

258.799 --> 261.59999999999997
do normal

264.08 --> 268.8
act normal that's already crazy enough

267.919 --> 270.639
that's pretty much

268.8 --> 274.16
the best translation that i could give

270.639 --> 276.639
it but yes that is a dutch saying

274.16 --> 277.28000000000003
i've been told that plenty of times in

276.639 --> 283.28000000000003
my youth

277.28 --> 285.59999999999997
i can tell you that

283.28 --> 287.19899999999996
it's typically something that some

285.6 --> 288.639
people would tell me when i was like

287.199 --> 292.24
very nervous

288.639 --> 297.68
on first contact to kind of like

292.24 --> 301.52
make me at ease and it did work

297.68 --> 303.759
right but that is indeed a dutch saying

301.52 --> 303.75899999999996
uh

306.4 --> 313.28
so yeah feeling pretty good today

310.639 --> 313.28000000000003
i've been up

314.56 --> 318.8
for a couple of hours taking it easy and

317.28 --> 322.96
really enjoying the good

318.8 --> 326.24
atmosphere good energy hanging

322.96 --> 329.68
especially like that just kind of that

326.24 --> 331.68
restless stormy period

329.68 --> 334.40000000000003
because it was like that for like a week

331.68 --> 337.759
including hail and all such craziness

334.4 --> 341.19899999999996
up until last wednesday

337.759 --> 344.32
kind of glad it's over because the just

341.199 --> 345.36
after that a lot of calm comes over me

344.32 --> 347.759
and i really

345.36 --> 348.639
like it comes the waters make things

347.759 --> 351.44
more clear

348.639 --> 353.36
to me so i really like it when it's like

351.44 --> 355.6
this

353.36 --> 355.6
huh

357.12 --> 360.4
right so yesterday

361.6 --> 364.639
did manage to get to get a couple of

363.6 --> 366.639
notes

364.639 --> 368.24
but yeah flat earth the early bird show

366.639 --> 369.919
yesterday was pretty good i didn't watch

368.24 --> 372.56
it back

369.919 --> 374.79999999999995
kind of wanted to but didn't get to it

372.56 --> 378.56
also didn't really get to a name

374.8 --> 379.36
so if anybody like has a a name on their

378.56 --> 384.0
mind

379.36 --> 384.0
for my show and

384.08 --> 388.24
yeah i wouldn't mind even afterward if

386.639 --> 390.8
you would leave a comment if i know

388.24 --> 392.56
it's like one of you guys actually takes

390.8 --> 395.12
things seriously not just

392.56 --> 395.919
the comment trolls because i have those

395.12 --> 398.8
still

395.919 --> 400.479
they still constantly keep doing that

398.8 --> 403.28000000000003
sort of thing

400.479 --> 404.31899999999996
but if anybody has like an idea for a

403.28 --> 406.63899999999995
good name

404.319 --> 408.319
or even a direction right i'll probably

406.639 --> 410.96000000000004
because i typically do alter

408.319 --> 412.16
it slightly like polish it a little

410.96 --> 415.68
further

412.16 --> 418.88000000000005
but it does help and i know that when

415.68 --> 423.039
my shows have names they're

418.88 --> 425.44
better to identify in the giant list

423.039 --> 426.31899999999996
so it does really help to give the show

425.44 --> 428.479
names but

426.319 --> 431.759
i don't always get like a really good

428.479 --> 434.8
idea of okay this really sums it up

431.759 --> 438.0
so if any of you have any ideas

434.8 --> 440.72
concerning names of the shows

438.0 --> 443.36
uh yeah i'd appreciate your input if you

440.72 --> 446.639
haven't i'm not saying you gotta do that

443.36 --> 447.52000000000004
but if you have the idea i i definitely

446.639 --> 451.12
appreciate

447.52 --> 453.35999999999996
if you shared the ideas for that

451.12 --> 455.8
right it's really tough figuring out a

453.36 --> 459.36
name when you've already done

455.8 --> 462.56
886 shows it's really tough

459.36 --> 462.96000000000004
because i don't want to like fall back

462.56 --> 466.479
to

462.96 --> 468.63899999999995
typical phrases

466.479 --> 470.31899999999996
that would be like yeah that's

468.639 --> 472.96000000000004
definitely arwinian but

470.319 --> 474.72
like you can only call it it has to be

472.96 --> 475.19899999999996
kind of unique every single time and

474.72 --> 478.56
really

475.199 --> 480.639
be adapted to what the show was

478.56 --> 482.639
as much as possible whether it's the

480.639 --> 483.52
essence of the show how i was feeling

482.639 --> 486.639
and acting

483.52 --> 489.19899999999996
or whether it be about the group of

486.639 --> 493.759
subjects that came afloat

489.199 --> 497.44
anyway uh yeah i had a long phone call

493.759 --> 500.96000000000004
with my friend again in america

497.44 --> 507.84
was pretty good lots of esoteric

500.96 --> 507.84
talk because we do that too it's like

508.4 --> 513.919
yeah it's

511.52 --> 514.959
you can't even like describe what that's

513.919 --> 517.36
like it's just like

514.959 --> 519.3599999999999
very high and you communicate almost

517.36 --> 521.12
telepathically because if you would be

519.36 --> 522.399
overhearing the conversation you might

521.12 --> 525.2
be like what

522.399 --> 525.2
what are you saying

525.44 --> 531.0400000000001
because we rest upon a whole bunch of

528.8 --> 533.8389999999999
understanding of each other and then

531.04 --> 535.1999999999999
at like taking everything into account

533.839 --> 538.8000000000001
with full feelings

535.2 --> 541.519
communicating yeah pretty high end

538.8 --> 543.519
right but different it's very much

541.519 --> 546.32
adapted to

543.519 --> 546.88
each specific other instead of like me

546.32 --> 552.1600000000001
now

546.88 --> 552.16
to a range of audience it's different

555.279 --> 558.399
also yeah mostly different in that i

557.76 --> 562.24
explain

558.399 --> 563.2
a lot less but i do i get idea response

562.24 --> 566.0
ideas like

563.2 --> 568.5600000000001
resolutions but i don't really have to

566.0 --> 571.44
detail it out as much

568.56 --> 572.64
because she like immediate like as soon

571.44 --> 575.44
as i get the idea

572.64 --> 576.0
open it up she immediately also receives

575.44 --> 577.9200000000001
it even

576.0 --> 579.76
before i finished explaining that

577.92 --> 581.4399999999999
typically happens

579.76 --> 582.8
it should sound familiar to a whole

581.44 --> 585.2
bunch of people that have

582.8 --> 587.519
typically that high-end communicators

585.2 --> 588.88
typically have that

587.519 --> 590.8
like somebody only has to start a

588.88 --> 594.88
sentence and it's very likely

590.8 --> 597.76
you already get if it's like

594.88 --> 598.8
a situation switching idea attitude

597.76 --> 600.8
sweet

598.8 --> 603.519
per people you're communicating with

600.8 --> 605.4399999999999
will probably get it before you finish

603.519 --> 608.399
the sentence and then some will have

605.44 --> 609.36
trouble holding back their enthusiasm

608.399 --> 612.0
enthusiasm

609.36 --> 612.48
over the recognition of it right it's

612.0 --> 615.279
different

612.48 --> 616.24
as when you're basically debating

615.279 --> 618.64
together

616.24 --> 619.6
talking about mechanics because with

618.64 --> 622.16
mechanics

619.6 --> 623.519
usually a new idea means a detail about

622.16 --> 625.1999999999999
something

623.519 --> 627.76
and then when you start a halfway

625.2 --> 629.36
sentence it's very unlikely the other is

627.76 --> 632.3199999999999
going to know exactly what

629.36 --> 633.2
person meant because it's more technical

632.32 --> 637.839
and you need to

633.2 --> 640.399
put more backdrop

637.839 --> 641.44
to find the detailed part it's very

640.399 --> 644.56
different as to

641.44 --> 647.6800000000001
like personal life social interactions

644.56 --> 648.2399999999999
situational switching ideas it's very

647.68 --> 652.0
different

648.24 --> 654.16
it's a different type of function anyway

652.0 --> 657.6
yeah i had that good conversation and

654.16 --> 657.6
after that rounded out

657.839 --> 663.36
my day watching some star wars sequels

661.12 --> 665.839
which is not surprising because yeah the

663.36 --> 665.839
video

666.16 --> 671.4399999999999
i talked about transcription

669.44 --> 673.6800000000001
had some good ideas about it and i

671.44 --> 675.0400000000001
wanted to refresh my memory about the

673.68 --> 676.56
movies

675.04 --> 678.24
like what they were like what was good

676.56 --> 680.4799999999999
about them what was not so good about

678.24 --> 680.48
them

680.72 --> 687.36
and yeah i'm like

684.32 --> 689.839
first the force awakens

687.36 --> 690.9590000000001
and it is such a mixed movie it's really

689.839 --> 695.2790000000001
bizarre

690.959 --> 697.92
some things like it's has beautiful

695.279 --> 700.72
scenes and like good ideas like good

697.92 --> 702.399
location ideas brilliant

700.72 --> 703.839
like one of those first scenes with the

702.399 --> 707.2
crashed

703.839 --> 710.9590000000001
all those old empire

707.2 --> 712.88
machines and a death of a star destroyer

710.959 --> 716.16
crashed and all the

712.88 --> 718.32
genius absolute genius and of course

716.16 --> 720.0
what's the the newer series what's it

718.32 --> 723.0400000000001
called again

720.0 --> 723.04
star wars series

723.73 --> 728.9590000000001
[Applause]

725.12 --> 731.6
the mandalorian totally

728.959 --> 733.68
took a ride on that specifically just a

731.6 --> 734.16
whole bunch of locations not so much

733.68 --> 735.68
talk

734.16 --> 738.0
and it was a great move and that's

735.68 --> 741.12
something that this

738.0 --> 742.959
the the sequel movies had issues with

741.12 --> 746.24
is that there seems to be a lot of

742.959 --> 748.3199999999999
illogical exposition

746.24 --> 750.48
like they're constantly filling things

748.32 --> 752.1600000000001
in in an unnatural way because they're

750.48 --> 753.6800000000001
afraid that the audience won't keep

752.16 --> 755.8389999999999
track of what's going on or they're

753.68 --> 758.8
trying to like virtue signals the fans

755.839 --> 762.8000000000001
that they know it it's very weird it's

758.8 --> 766.16
and there were definitely issues

762.8 --> 766.88
also with the the entire the atmosphere

766.16 --> 769.12
of things

766.88 --> 769.12
like

770.399 --> 775.6
in a way it was slightly exaggerated and

773.519 --> 778.0
cartoonish which

775.6 --> 781.839
is a really stark contrast when you

778.0 --> 781.839
compare it to like the original

782.079 --> 784.6389999999999
trilogy

785.36 --> 788.72
because they had a much better balance

787.279 --> 792.079
as to natural

788.72 --> 795.279
unfolding responses versus like

792.079 --> 796.079
serious pressured situations and what

795.279 --> 798.8
you're like then

796.079 --> 801.12
the acting was just better in the

798.8 --> 803.3599999999999
original movie it really was in the

801.12 --> 805.04
original trilogy

803.36 --> 808.0790000000001
especially first and the second it was

805.04 --> 810.56
just a lot better more focused

808.079 --> 813.279
the the director probably had a lot

810.56 --> 817.1199999999999
stronger coherent vision as to

813.279 --> 817.519
the dream of it so the newer one seems

817.12 --> 820.72
more

817.519 --> 823.44
assembled in a way

820.72 --> 824.88
that really stood out to me and good

823.44 --> 826.72
parts and really just

824.88 --> 828.88
stupid parts and i think that a whole

826.72 --> 830.399
bunch of movie reviewers like for

828.88 --> 833.8389999999999
transcription and all that

830.399 --> 833.839
they agreed to that and they

833.92 --> 837.76
took a bet with yeah they carefully

835.92 --> 840.88
tried to rearrange

837.76 --> 844.48
the scenes and set up to

840.88 --> 844.48
to get to get that

844.56 --> 850.959
that vision back into it which is kind

847.68 --> 852.959
of lacking it's kind of stuttering

850.959 --> 854.16
right so it was interesting watching it

852.959 --> 858.0
it got

854.16 --> 860.639
like into a quarter of the second one

858.0 --> 862.48
and my god is that movie annoying in so

860.639 --> 865.519
many ways

862.48 --> 868.32
like in the start you get the feeling

865.519 --> 871.519
like wait this could really work out

868.32 --> 875.1990000000001
and then like total

871.519 --> 878.639
like unrealistic

875.199 --> 881.279
attitudes it's like the it's almost like

878.639 --> 884.0790000000001
the actors couldn't hide their pride

881.279 --> 886.16
of being in the star wars movie some new

884.079 --> 889.199
or introduced characters in there

886.16 --> 889.76
and it's like what are you doing this is

889.199 --> 893.12
not

889.76 --> 896.24
cosplay this is not some star wars

893.12 --> 900.16
reenactment this is the real movie

896.24 --> 902.5600000000001
you have to suppress realizing you're in

900.16 --> 904.88
a star wars movie this is super annoying

902.56 --> 906.7199999999999
to watch

904.88 --> 913.8389999999999
has anybody else had that sensation with

906.72 --> 913.839
the second sequel what's the name again

916.56 --> 919.92
let me look through

924.639 --> 927.839
yeah the last jedi

934.24 --> 942.32
also yeah watching through it again

938.639 --> 944.5600000000001
it's weird because when force awakens

942.32 --> 946.1600000000001
first came out it was really in like

944.56 --> 948.88
post obama era

946.16 --> 950.959
and where i personally was still very

948.88 --> 953.759
upset with sjw

950.959 --> 954.0
type of influence overall in hollywood

953.759 --> 956.24
and

954.0 --> 957.92
that everybody was anticipating that

956.24 --> 959.199
what happened to the new star wars as

957.92 --> 963.04
well

959.199 --> 965.3599999999999
and in ways they did and that colored

963.04 --> 968.48
how i looked at it at that time now

965.36 --> 973.279
watching back

968.48 --> 975.6800000000001
checking out like the finn character

973.279 --> 976.56
the transcription guy totally called it

975.68 --> 979.3599999999999
because

976.56 --> 981.1199999999999
back then i was like ah no come on

979.36 --> 985.04
really you do it like this

981.12 --> 987.279
why and

985.04 --> 990.56
he could have indeed gotten a much

987.279 --> 990.56
bigger role because that guy

991.36 --> 994.88
he's like one of the character that is

993.6 --> 997.759
like really

994.88 --> 999.199
in the movie and not like oh i'm a star

997.759 --> 1001.12
wars character he's like a

999.199 --> 1003.8389999999999
pretty he's actually a pretty good actor

1001.12 --> 1007.199
at it i think he has a lot of potence

1003.839 --> 1007.1990000000001
and it was kind of wasted

1008.399 --> 1012.639
in many ways he should have like become

1011.36 --> 1015.44
like a jedi

1012.639 --> 1017.279
naturally because he had he had the

1015.44 --> 1019.1990000000001
spirit in a way right he had some

1017.279 --> 1021.519
conflict some things to overcome

1019.199 --> 1022.24
it was a pretty good luke skywalker set

1021.519 --> 1024.959
up actually

1022.24 --> 1027.52
like a black luke skywalker guy that

1024.959 --> 1028.88
came from stormtrooper it was a lot of

1027.52 --> 1033.6
potential there

1028.88 --> 1036.0
and they kind of yeah they didn't really

1033.6 --> 1039.839
unfold it as much as as they should have

1036.0 --> 1039.839
it's kind of a waste like that

1040.079 --> 1043.6789999999999
yeah it sucked didn't watch the third

1041.679 --> 1045.76
yeah the third is really

1043.679 --> 1046.72
just kind of like extravagant it's like

1045.76 --> 1050.24
a big

1046.72 --> 1052.72
space opera thing and the story is just

1050.24 --> 1054.96
messy it gets kind of cartoonish like

1052.72 --> 1054.96
that

1055.36 --> 1059.1999999999998
it was still worth watching but it just

1057.679 --> 1062.64
in a lot of ways is like

1059.2 --> 1067.8400000000001
it's like already you're

1062.64 --> 1067.8400000000001
still disappointed

1071.2 --> 1075.3600000000001
right i haven't gotten to watching that

1072.88 --> 1075.3600000000001
one back

1078.84 --> 1086.6399999999999
anyway

1081.2 --> 1086.64
hello logan's run pat v tiny womble

1089.84 --> 1092.8799999999999
right but yeah the first the first

1092.24 --> 1096.64
sequel

1092.88 --> 1096.64
really wasn't that bad

1097.2 --> 1108.799
looking back at it after a long time

1100.0 --> 1111.84
it's held up better than the other ones

1108.799 --> 1113.44
and again they had a lot of things going

1111.84 --> 1116.48
for it to really

1113.44 --> 1118.64
lay out how the empire had reinvented

1116.48 --> 1120.4
itself through the first order

1118.64 --> 1122.24
even though it seems kind of like oh

1120.4 --> 1124.96
really that's gonna happen

1122.24 --> 1126.4
well yeah in ways it would and they were

1124.96 --> 1128.24
already talking about like heavy

1126.4 --> 1131.76
conditioning and how that would work

1128.24 --> 1132.96
well they could have given that more

1131.76 --> 1135.84
filling to kind of

1132.96 --> 1136.64
make it more obvious like why the first

1135.84 --> 1140.9599999999998
order

1136.64 --> 1140.96
was there in the face of it

1141.679 --> 1146.0800000000002
but it it all got buried on the just oh

1145.36 --> 1148.0
look we

1146.08 --> 1149.6789999999999
we're gonna do this again because that's

1148.0 --> 1151.6
popular but we're gonna do it bigger

1149.679 --> 1153.679
like even bigger death stars like a

1151.6 --> 1156.7199999999998
planet death star now

1153.679 --> 1160.16
and ooh destroying multiple planets for

1156.72 --> 1162.4
with no run-up to that no

1160.16 --> 1164.72
actual tension building no real series

1162.4 --> 1165.76
it's just like oh this [ __ ] is there and

1164.72 --> 1167.84
then like oh

1165.76 --> 1169.84
they completely obliterate the enemy

1167.84 --> 1172.0
even it's really weird like they're all

1169.84 --> 1175.039
in one star system

1172.0 --> 1177.28
it's like yeah what so it all

1175.039 --> 1179.679
just kind of got buried on there look we

1177.28 --> 1180.16
got better special effect check this out

1179.679 --> 1184.24
it got

1180.16 --> 1187.8400000000001
buried under all that the subtlety was

1184.24 --> 1190.4
lost because of it that's a waste

1187.84 --> 1193.28
it's one of what the the originals had

1190.4 --> 1196.0
really right they really knew

1193.28 --> 1196.8799999999999
the pauses and the side to let things

1196.0 --> 1199.679
soak in

1196.88 --> 1200.96
to really give a feel of what it's like

1199.679 --> 1204.4
to be there and all that

1200.96 --> 1206.48
and yeah the the the pre the sequels got

1204.4 --> 1210.799
really buried under just

1206.48 --> 1210.799
look at this so there's the spectacle

1210.88 --> 1221.8400000000001
right anyway enough about star wars

1226.88 --> 1238.5590000000002
what have you guys been up to

1235.12 --> 1241.28
your imagination won't go there now

1238.559 --> 1241.28
what a waste

1242.64 --> 1246.96
like is it am i really one of the few

1245.6 --> 1251.6
flat earthers

1246.96 --> 1251.6000000000001
out here that can still really enjoy it

1253.28 --> 1255.52
like

1257.76 --> 1261.039
like is it so important that it it must

1260.72 --> 1263.52
be

1261.039 --> 1264.72
real like it must be possible to be real

1263.52 --> 1266.4
in some way right

1264.72 --> 1269.76
because like when you think about for

1266.4 --> 1273.039
example the lord of the rings

1269.76 --> 1274.8799999999999
that universe is also fictional it's

1273.039 --> 1276.4
kind of like more upfront about it and

1274.88 --> 1278.96
there is of course like

1276.4 --> 1280.88
the mystery like what is it based on is

1278.96 --> 1282.88
it some kind of a pre-world

1280.88 --> 1284.7990000000002
you can still fantasize about it like

1282.88 --> 1287.7600000000002
that i guess

1284.799 --> 1290.32
but it's still technically something

1287.76 --> 1294.08
that was just never real well

1290.32 --> 1294.08
that's not in the way

1296.08 --> 1301.6
right then why should like outer space

1299.44 --> 1301.6000000000001
and

1303.44 --> 1307.679
and all that why should that knowing

1306.32 --> 1310.8799999999999
that that's fake that's

1307.679 --> 1319.8400000000001
imaginary why should that be in the way

1310.88 --> 1319.8400000000001
i don't know

1319.919 --> 1326.159
i guess that in an odd sort of way

1323.12 --> 1329.039
you could probably like even take the

1326.159 --> 1332.5590000000002
entire star wars idea

1329.039 --> 1336.799
and then turn it all into

1332.559 --> 1338.72
earth-based like there is giant ships

1336.799 --> 1340.6399999999999
they can be really giant it's just

1338.72 --> 1343.52
assumed that there is a lot of land and

1340.64 --> 1345.679
that there are multiple connected realms

1343.52 --> 1346.559
and that they're not literally going to

1345.679 --> 1349.3600000000001
make a ball

1346.559 --> 1350.32
explode and it's destroyed forever they

1349.36 --> 1353.28
could

1350.32 --> 1355.4399999999998
drop yeah drop big bombs whatever rays

1353.28 --> 1359.12
make craters

1355.44 --> 1361.6000000000001
ruin realms perhaps that would be next

1359.12 --> 1364.799
to one another and it would just all be

1361.6 --> 1365.9189999999999
on earth like in the skies over earth

1364.799 --> 1369.28
every single time

1365.919 --> 1369.8400000000001
like you could rearrange the entire star

1369.28 --> 1373.28
wars

1369.84 --> 1377.12
universe like that would that

1373.28 --> 1380.08
make it better i guess there wouldn't be

1377.12 --> 1381.6789999999999
much use for like a light speed jump but

1380.08 --> 1384.1589999999999
you could still just have

1381.679 --> 1385.2800000000002
fast travel jumps or turn it into like

1384.159 --> 1389.8400000000001
gates

1385.28 --> 1389.84
to instantly transport

1400.24 --> 1403.28
seeing politics of the day in movies

1402.24 --> 1406.4
kills it yeah

1403.28 --> 1416.559
i get that i totally get that that's

1406.4 --> 1421.1200000000001
i know

1416.559 --> 1421.12
yeah the patronizing influence it's very

1428.84 --> 1434.76
annoying

1431.52 --> 1438.799
watch the dreadful film emp

1434.76 --> 1441.52
333 days oh okay never heard of it

1438.799 --> 1441.52
tiny one more

1443.039 --> 1447.44
hey oh hey here we go again good to see

1445.679 --> 1450.48
you

1447.44 --> 1450.48
seeking star water

1457.6 --> 1476.0
such deep okay

1473.12 --> 1476.9599999999998
i don't know man to me like even the

1476.0 --> 1479.36
idea of space

1476.96 --> 1480.48
exploration which is more like the the

1479.36 --> 1483.039
earth type

1480.48 --> 1483.76
nasa related or whatever slightly into

1483.039 --> 1485.919
the future

1483.76 --> 1487.84
space station around the earth and all

1485.919 --> 1490.159
that orange saturn or whatever

1487.84 --> 1491.84
that type of movie to me it's just kind

1490.159 --> 1494.88
of a metaphor

1491.84 --> 1499.36
it's just a metaphorical universe

1494.88 --> 1502.48
to the exploration

1499.36 --> 1502.799
of earth like that it's all these things

1502.48 --> 1506.72
are

1502.799 --> 1509.52
all originally based on experiences

1506.72 --> 1511.1200000000001
related to like ship travel like the

1509.52 --> 1512.8799999999999
hunger and the isolation

1511.12 --> 1514.9599999999998
and everybody getting diseased or

1512.88 --> 1516.64
curling crazy

1514.96 --> 1521.2
not knowing where they are but getting

1516.64 --> 1524.72
stuck and basically a lot of space

1521.2 --> 1527.279
related tropes and things that happen

1524.72 --> 1528.159
they kind of work because they're all

1527.279 --> 1532.0
like based

1528.159 --> 1532.5590000000002
on on the exploration phase in my

1532.0 --> 1535.76
opinion

1532.559 --> 1539.9189999999999
that's what over time cross-referencing

1535.76 --> 1539.919
it it just seems it to be based on that

1541.32 --> 1544.799
self-exploration uh

1545.679 --> 1552.88
sure well

1550.32 --> 1553.6789999999999
when you get tested and confronted and

1552.88 --> 1558.0
especially

1553.679 --> 1561.1200000000001
like endurance test you do get you do

1558.0 --> 1571.84
self explore that just you have to

1561.12 --> 1571.84
that happens

1581.35 --> 1585.84
[Music]

1582.84 --> 1585.84
um

1588.64 --> 1593.88
[Music]

1599.6 --> 1602.9599999999998
right here we go yeah yeah yeah i gave

1601.6 --> 1606.6399999999999
you the babylon 5

1602.96 --> 1606.64
ride and what a ride it is right

1608.96 --> 1615.8400000000001
it's really special

1613.44 --> 1617.76
because the re the thing about it it's

1615.84 --> 1627.84
really all character driven and that's

1617.76 --> 1627.84
what makes babylon 5 so awesome

1629.2 --> 1635.2
black superman what what are you talking

1632.08 --> 1635.1999999999998
about iron 26

1638.84 --> 1641.84
what

1650.799 --> 1656.399
uh yeah

1654.0 --> 1657.52
okay yeah sorry i seem to had some

1656.399 --> 1669.84
connection issues but

1657.52 --> 1669.84
i was on it quick

1694.84 --> 1697.84
hmm

1707.039 --> 1712.24
everything what they're trying to do

1710.0 --> 1716.32
that

1712.24 --> 1716.32
it's super annoying i know

1719.84 --> 1725.6789999999999
but to me the real woke issue

1722.96 --> 1727.52
is where the people they pick and insert

1725.679 --> 1730.48
because

1727.52 --> 1732.72
they're woke like it's work to do that

1730.48 --> 1735.279
or whatever

1732.72 --> 1736.0
it doesn't have to be bad if those

1735.279 --> 1739.279
people

1736.0 --> 1742.559
don't carry that like

1739.279 --> 1745.44
oh i am woke so

1742.559 --> 1746.799
that's why i'm good and why this is good

1745.44 --> 1749.1200000000001
like

1746.799 --> 1752.0
if they just happen to be picked for

1749.12 --> 1755.039
some woke reason

1752.0 --> 1757.279
that's like yeah i wouldn't manage

1755.039 --> 1758.1589999999999
doing yeah movies and all that like that

1757.279 --> 1761.6
at all

1758.159 --> 1763.6000000000001
but if those people

1761.6 --> 1765.279
themselves at least do a good job and

1763.6 --> 1768.799
really get into the role

1765.279 --> 1768.799
then it doesn't have to be bad

1769.36 --> 1775.76
right it's not automatically bad

1773.039 --> 1777.279
but it gets bad if the woke people

1775.76 --> 1780.799
chosen

1777.279 --> 1782.32
because of woke reasons get really woke

1780.799 --> 1785.279
in the movie

1782.32 --> 1786.72
and and like really get oh this i'm good

1785.279 --> 1788.64
it's so important

1786.72 --> 1790.0
you have to like this because that's

1788.64 --> 1793.039
woke

1790.0 --> 1795.2
that is really annoying when that

1793.039 --> 1796.399
happened but that literally like ruins

1795.2 --> 1799.6000000000001
movies

1796.399 --> 1802.9599999999998
like they try it but it ruins it

1799.6 --> 1802.9599999999998
almost every single time

1805.44 --> 1809.8400000000001
all right anyway

1818.0 --> 1823.76
i think i did read to making

1821.039 --> 1826.8799999999999
a black superman okay well dude if they

1823.76 --> 1826.8799999999999
want a black superman

1834.84 --> 1839.4399999999998
sure

1836.159 --> 1839.44
if he does a good job

1840.399 --> 1844.08
right it it could be interesting it

1842.96 --> 1847.2
could also be

1844.08 --> 1847.1999999999998
super annoying

1847.919 --> 1855.3600000000001
like would it be like a black

1851.679 --> 1858.48
superman a a black uh

1855.36 --> 1860.24
kryptonian because why wouldn't they

1858.48 --> 1864.159
have black kryptonians right

1860.24 --> 1868.159
why not but would he then be

1864.159 --> 1871.6000000000001
on earth a african-american

1868.159 --> 1875.279
woke superman that would be like

1871.6 --> 1877.519
oh shut the [ __ ] up stop

1875.279 --> 1878.96
acting like a bike thief his own

1877.519 --> 1881.1200000000001
benjamin would say it

1878.96 --> 1882.159
if he's just happens to be black but he

1881.12 --> 1886.32
still like

1882.159 --> 1888.7990000000002
has the the real kryptonian honor sense

1886.32 --> 1891.12
and serious and focused and not some

1888.799 --> 1895.36
stupid trope

1891.12 --> 1895.36
wouldn't have to be bad right

1896.159 --> 1898.88
i'm just saying

1902.32 --> 1908.6399999999999
it's not necessary to do such a movie

1906.08 --> 1909.9189999999999
or with a black superman or whatever but

1908.64 --> 1912.72
i'm just saying like if

1909.919 --> 1914.24
they did it it wouldn't have to be bad

1912.72 --> 1917.279
necessarily

1914.24 --> 1920.72
you it might surprise you right

1917.279 --> 1923.039
the guy did a really good focus job

1920.72 --> 1924.24
and didn't let the good wokeness or it

1923.039 --> 1935.84
didn't

1924.24 --> 1935.84
get too programmed

1937.039 --> 1940.1589999999999
i think they made one of superman's

1938.96 --> 1942.799
relatives

1940.159 --> 1943.519
oh so it's gonna be another family

1942.799 --> 1945.9189999999999
member

1943.519 --> 1948.64
it's not like a remaking where they all

1945.919 --> 1951.2
were black or something

1948.64 --> 1952.3200000000002
like the black jesus effect it's like no

1951.2 --> 1954.64
no

1952.32 --> 1956.08
jesus was black so that means let's do

1954.64 --> 1958.88
it and it's all black

1956.08 --> 1958.8799999999999
that's the way it is

1960.64 --> 1964.64
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

1965.76 --> 1970.799
kanye west for the party wow

1974.84 --> 1982.399
uh i don't think that would work

1978.96 --> 1985.1200000000001
maybe it would it's it's just

1982.399 --> 1987.6789999999999
it would probably just be not black

1985.12 --> 1991.84
superman it would be kanye west superman

1987.679 --> 1991.8400000000001
if kanye west did it

1997.039 --> 2007.44
the new super king of earth all right

2005.84 --> 2009.279
of course clutch where it's why they're

2007.44 --> 2011.2
doing it but yeah

2009.279 --> 2014.159
what are you gonna do there's nothing

2011.2 --> 2014.159
you could do about it

2015.44 --> 2019.8400000000001
they're not gonna stop that [ __ ]

2034.96 --> 2039.44
super they oh my god

2043.2 --> 2047.6000000000001
no now if if they did that's really

2046.88 --> 2052.0
[ __ ] up

2047.6 --> 2054.7999999999997
if they do that superman

2052.0 --> 2054.8
it's math

2057.28 --> 2062.8790000000004
oh my god iron 26.

2060.639 --> 2062.879
oh

2067.04 --> 2075.04
now we're seeing that yeah that

2070.8 --> 2078.639
ma'am in the superman monster

2075.04 --> 2083.2
like hey superman i need your help

2078.639 --> 2083.2000000000003
it's man it's ma'am

2085.119 --> 2089.839
come on amanda young that one is funny

2087.44 --> 2089.839
go on

2099.359 --> 2103.04
no robert downey jr but that's not funny

2102.0 --> 2106.0
clutch bear that's

2103.04 --> 2106.0
that's just lame

2106.96 --> 2117.839
like that's just stupid

2119.04 --> 2123.04
this is not the saloon for that level

2124.32 --> 2131.839
take it to owen benjamin's

2138.16 --> 2145.839
never seen tropic thunder what is that

2140.56 --> 2145.839
never heard of that

2157.2 --> 2160.3199999999997
dude seriously i'm not thinking like

2159.68 --> 2166.7999999999997
super

2160.32 --> 2166.8
ma'am that would be a hilarious

2166.96 --> 2172.48
like comedy move it could be an

2170.0 --> 2174.079
hilarious comedy movie if you made like

2172.48 --> 2179.28
a fake superman

2174.079 --> 2182.1600000000003
or like a superman parody with superman

2179.28 --> 2184.8
sounds really stupid i guess but holy

2182.16 --> 2187.359
[ __ ] if somebody seriously got onto that

2184.8 --> 2189.3590000000004
that could be freaking amazing right in

2187.359 --> 2192.4
this era right

2189.359 --> 2201.839
good luck with that just saying it

2192.4 --> 2201.839
it could be

2205.76 --> 2212.8390000000004
black face dude just leave black flash

2209.44 --> 2215.119
face alone i don't think blackface is

2212.839 --> 2217.52
funny

2215.119 --> 2218.4
but i do appreciate our dutch tradition

2217.52 --> 2221.7599999999998
of

2218.4 --> 2224.7200000000003
black pete's like so just

2221.76 --> 2229.8390000000004
i don't like it just leave it alone it's

2224.72 --> 2229.839
not funny

2230.16 --> 2243.839
i don't think it has a place in in

2233.359 --> 2243.839
movies or something

2247.28 --> 2257.8390000000004
they don't make fun of wreck well that's

2251.119 --> 2257.839
but that's it's a wasted opportunity

2259.119 --> 2262.8
we already have oh god

2265.52 --> 2271.839
no but

2277.119 --> 2285.2000000000003
if earth larp dumpster fire good to see

2280.56 --> 2288.0789999999997
you in chat

2285.2 --> 2290.3199999999997
uh right but they they wouldn't have to

2288.079 --> 2292.4
make fun of it it wouldn't be like oh

2290.32 --> 2293.839
the movie where you shamed the [ __ ]

2292.4 --> 2296.64
all the time no

2293.839 --> 2298.96
no not at all it would actually be more

2296.64 --> 2302.72
about just like the typical

2298.96 --> 2306.4
issues and

2302.72 --> 2313.359
it could make it really funny and still

2306.4 --> 2315.52
interesting it is dude it's just like

2313.359 --> 2317.2799999999997
this world can't do it i'm just saying

2315.52 --> 2319.52
it would have been a possibility

2317.28 --> 2320.5600000000004
theoretically and it would be really

2319.52 --> 2323.28
funny and

2320.56 --> 2324.64
like as long as like right wing left

2323.28 --> 2327.2000000000003
wing can

2324.64 --> 2329.44
leave it off and and truly make it a

2327.2 --> 2332.64
neutral thing

2329.44 --> 2336.56
and honest and funny because of it

2332.64 --> 2338.3199999999997
right it is a possibility

2336.56 --> 2340.32
it's just that this world and the

2338.32 --> 2341.52
directors out there nobody's gonna do

2340.32 --> 2345.04
that

2341.52 --> 2347.04
they don't have the balls to do it

2345.04 --> 2348.32
they are going to be peer pressured one

2347.04 --> 2352.48
way or the other

2348.32 --> 2355.839
right and that'll ruin it

2352.48 --> 2355.839
they'll not make it funny

2369.2 --> 2374.96
never go full [ __ ] what in real

2371.76 --> 2374.96
federica is

2376.56 --> 2380.32
trouble trying to say war spoof

2381.76 --> 2389.3590000000004
wow i didn't know that nathan

2386.72 --> 2392.64
i really didn't maybe because i just

2389.359 --> 2392.64
didn't really care for it

2392.72 --> 2397.839
it is it a good film

2406.0 --> 2412.72
yeah i would oh god yeah

2409.04 --> 2425.839
not not literally oh

2412.72 --> 2425.839
but maybe literally it doesn't matter

2441.119 --> 2445.6800000000003
but look if you're gonna bring up

2442.88 --> 2447.92
blackface and [ __ ]

2445.68 --> 2449.2799999999997
like i don't really care for what

2447.92 --> 2451.44
happened in the past

2449.28 --> 2453.0400000000004
but you could potentially try to make

2451.44 --> 2456.4
something funny out of it

2453.04 --> 2458.88
though if you tried like a

2456.4 --> 2459.52
an all-white cast that all did blackface

2458.88 --> 2463.2000000000003
and were all

2459.52 --> 2466.64
very seriously trying to act like

2463.2 --> 2470.64
like old black folk from like

2466.64 --> 2473.04
early 20th century or something then

2470.64 --> 2474.319
it might be interesting of course

2473.04 --> 2476.16
everybody's going to be all

2474.319 --> 2477.44
insulted like why didn't you use any

2476.16 --> 2480.7999999999997
black people

2477.44 --> 2481.92
in the all black movie right that sort

2480.8 --> 2484.2400000000002
of thing

2481.92 --> 2486.16
just saying they all got into it and

2484.24 --> 2488.0789999999997
they were actually serious did not make

2486.16 --> 2490.96
it look stupid

2488.079 --> 2493.44
really did their best it could actually

2490.96 --> 2496.7200000000003
be halfway interesting here i am again

2493.44 --> 2497.839
seeding hope in this insane world right

2496.72 --> 2501.1189999999997
now

2497.839 --> 2504.16
in that field it's gonna be moan

2501.119 --> 2505.839
out of the way immediately but i can't

2504.16 --> 2509.04
help but just think out loud about this

2505.839 --> 2511.119
sort of thing

2509.04 --> 2512.079
your prime minister does blackface yeah

2511.119 --> 2514.56
yeah yeah we know

2512.079 --> 2516.5600000000004
we know clutch bear don't don't get

2514.56 --> 2523.839
obsessed over paint on your face

2516.56 --> 2523.839
don't get don't obsess over that

2539.359 --> 2541.839
nobody

2546.079 --> 2554.5600000000004
is that like from the actor of the

2549.68 --> 2554.56
spaghetti westerns italian actors

2554.88 --> 2560.7200000000003
because maybe it's probably

2558.16 --> 2560.72
another one

2561.28 --> 2567.8390000000004
it's comedy and like western

2565.52 --> 2571.04
the the one that i remember maybe that's

2567.839 --> 2571.04
not nobody i don't know

2572.72 --> 2579.839
it's been done already really amanda you

2576.16 --> 2579.839
i didn't know that

2590.839 --> 2593.839
what

2595.76 --> 2598.5600000000004
thomas curtis

2600.079 --> 2603.6800000000003
i'm getting a little confused now as to

2602.4 --> 2605.76
what you're

2603.68 --> 2607.44
like what are you connecting like thomas

2605.76 --> 2608.079
curtis are you talking about the movie

2607.44 --> 2611.119
no one

2608.079 --> 2612.96
nobody i guess i'll have to google what

2611.119 --> 2615.28
it is

2612.96 --> 2615.28
uh

2618.839 --> 2623.7599999999998
2021 okay that's definitely not the

2621.68 --> 2628.0
spaghetti western

2623.76 --> 2628.0
series from the 80s

2628.88 --> 2635.839
okay i have no idea what this movie is

2637.119 --> 2645.2000000000003
oh wait i think i did see like a

2640.88 --> 2649.839
preview for that it's with the

2645.2 --> 2649.839

[Music]

2680.96 --> 2684.7200000000003
hello good to see you

2689.52 --> 2693.839
the scientist from back to the future

2693.92 --> 2705.839
emmett brown what's his name again is he

2696.8 --> 2705.8390000000004

2717.92 --> 2721.52
christopher lloyd right

2724.64 --> 2730.96
holy [ __ ] he is

2727.76 --> 2732.5600000000004
that's awesome that's weird i must have

2730.96 --> 2734.8
mixed him up with somebody else that

2732.56 --> 2737.04
kind of looks like him

2734.8 --> 2739.92
i thought he was dead well glad to see

2737.04 --> 2739.92
he's still alive

2744.839 --> 2747.839
interesting

2749.599 --> 2753.839
hmm okay well maybe i'll check out that

2753.119 --> 2761.839
movie

2753.839 --> 2761.839
it sounds interesting

2780.96 --> 2789.839
stonking what is stonking i don't know

2783.599 --> 2789.839
what that means

2797.119 --> 2801.2000000000003
all right and jado thank you for trying

2799.359 --> 2802.96
to get it more on the flat earth train

2801.2 --> 2805.7599999999998
because we're talking about movies today

2802.96 --> 2805.76
a lot it seems

2806.319 --> 2810.079
ballers getting killed in debates daily

2808.8 --> 2812.88
why do they even bother

2810.079 --> 2814.6400000000003
well because they're in the process of

2812.88 --> 2817.76
gaslighting themselves to keep

2814.64 --> 2818.64
up their faith like they know they are

2817.76 --> 2821.8390000000004
defeated

2818.64 --> 2822.96
but they can't give up they feel there's

2821.839 --> 2826.24
more to be done

2822.96 --> 2826.56
and there will be right the money hasn't

2826.24 --> 2831.7599999999998
run

2826.56 --> 2836.319
out yet

2831.76 --> 2838.88
as long as their faith is supported

2836.319 --> 2839.92
they're not gonna give up even if they

2838.88 --> 2842.319
know

2839.92 --> 2844.4
it's all for nothing they cannot even

2842.319 --> 2847.359
begin to find a way through

2844.4 --> 2848.1600000000003
to succeed so they just spent their time

2847.359 --> 2851.52
gaslighting

2848.16 --> 2854.5589999999997
like no no no their arguments are wrong

2851.52 --> 2856.839
they don't understand when it's them

2854.559 --> 2858.559
that don't understand and they got it

2856.839 --> 2861.599
wrong

2858.559 --> 2863.599
projecting chanting gaslighting

2861.599 --> 2865.3590000000004
but since it's not going to work on flat

2863.599 --> 2867.04
earthers maybe on

2865.359 --> 2868.96
outsiders that don't know anything about

2867.04 --> 2871.44
it in the arguments

2868.96 --> 2872.4
then they eventually end up gaslighting

2871.44 --> 2875.119
themselves

2872.4 --> 2876.48
that's why i literally say it like that

2875.119 --> 2879.52
i'd like to

2876.48 --> 2883.44
consider it our wind trademark

2879.52 --> 2886.8
gaslighting yourself it's what we face

2883.44 --> 2901.839
people gaslighting themselves

2886.8 --> 2901.8390000000004
chanting you could call it chanting

2912.839 --> 2917.7599999999998
hmm

2914.8 --> 2919.119
all right by the way i hope you guys

2917.76 --> 2920.96
also keep track

2919.119 --> 2922.48
of like some of the other flat earth

2920.96 --> 2925.76
debaters

2922.48 --> 2929.52
like flat side and brine

2925.76 --> 2930.8
like flat side has a lot of small videos

2929.52 --> 2933.839
he puts out

2930.8 --> 2935.2000000000003
on a daily basis and brian also is

2933.839 --> 2939.119
increasing the rate

2935.2 --> 2941.359
of his output short presentations

2939.119 --> 2943.839
so from yesterday there was some really

2941.359 --> 2943.839
good stuff

2948.16 --> 2951.52
yeah this is funny because brian made a

2950.0 --> 2954.16
video and it was

2951.52 --> 2956.4
it's basically also in i have to say

2954.16 --> 2957.52
inspired on the conversation we had in

2956.4 --> 2962.079
the after show

2957.52 --> 2965.92
after the recording stop about

2962.079 --> 2966.96
the celestial sphere star rotation and

2965.92 --> 2969.6800000000003
the fact

2966.96 --> 2970.96
that at the equator you can see both

2969.68 --> 2974.64
southern cross

2970.96 --> 2978.559
and polaris it on

2974.64 --> 2979.44
both above the horizon and that it's all

2978.559 --> 2983.8390000000004
just still

2979.44 --> 2985.76
the apparent sphere it's still just

2983.839 --> 2988.24
flawlessly connected so that

2985.76 --> 2989.3590000000004
tech that sighting would make absolutely

2988.24 --> 2990.9599999999996
no sense

2989.359 --> 2993.2
if you were actually standing on the

2990.96 --> 2996.319
ball because

2993.2 --> 2999.359
polaris southern cross center would

2996.319 --> 3003.359
should never appear above the horizon it

2999.359 --> 3003.359
should actually appear slightly below it

3008.16 --> 3015.2799999999997
yet it's right there the way it is

3012.16 --> 3018.72
above the horizon at the equator

3015.28 --> 3021.6400000000003
and that makes no sense on a ball at all

3018.72 --> 3024.64
and hey i even remembered that from like

3021.64 --> 3024.64
2015

3025.52 --> 3029.68
it just kind of like moved away because

3027.44 --> 3031.359
people didn't understand what stars are

3029.68 --> 3033.1189999999997
actually and they were still like oh

3031.359 --> 3034.24
does that mean it does not work on a

3033.119 --> 3037.119
ball so

3034.24 --> 3038.3999999999996
where are they floating over the disk

3037.119 --> 3040.319
and that was where everybody was

3038.4 --> 3043.6800000000003
latching on to

3040.319 --> 3046.64
and that of course i really

3043.68 --> 3047.04
tried to completely reroute a way out of

3046.64 --> 3049.839
that

3047.04 --> 3055.2
presupposition by suggesting it's

3049.839 --> 3068.0789999999997
holographic all of it

3055.2 --> 3070.16
yeah get out of here

3068.079 --> 3071.44
where is the southern cross located on

3070.16 --> 3075.68
effie

3071.44 --> 3078.8
south in the celestial south

3075.68 --> 3081.52
right now it all depends on what the

3078.8 --> 3082.559
realm is actually like what the

3081.52 --> 3085.52
orientation is

3082.559 --> 3087.0400000000004
but i'm kind of like on a base

3085.52 --> 3091.7599999999998
presumption

3087.04 --> 3095.2799999999997
that it's rectangular looping and yeah

3091.76 --> 3098.0
on that layout south

3095.28 --> 3098.96
is a singular direction just as up and

3098.0 --> 3101.119
down

3098.96 --> 3102.079
so yeah it's going to be south you're

3101.119 --> 3104.7200000000003
going to see it

3102.079 --> 3107.2000000000003
south in that direction a uniform

3104.72 --> 3110.319
direction

3107.2 --> 3112.7999999999997
no south isn't all around fe because

3110.319 --> 3115.839
that would be presuming

3112.8 --> 3118.96
the flat earth realm is a literal disk

3115.839 --> 3119.839
like the map projections right and i

3118.96 --> 3122.88
contest

3119.839 --> 3122.88
that notion

3122.96 --> 3126.64
the map is not the terrain it's not

3125.839 --> 3129.68
literal

3126.64 --> 3133.359
it's a projection

3129.68 --> 3139.839
the grid is not to scale

3133.359 --> 3139.839
it's a projection

3164.839 --> 3167.839
right

3179.76 --> 3187.76
right so do i need to show

3183.599 --> 3191.3590000000004
show it i could find

3187.76 --> 3194.1600000000003
some visual support to maybe clarify the

3191.359 --> 3197.92
things that i just said

3194.16 --> 3200.319
let me get into my flat earth picture

3197.92 --> 3202.2400000000002
library it's not that big it's mostly my

3200.319 --> 3209.839
sketches

3202.24 --> 3209.839
uh let's see

3212.0 --> 3214.319
hmm

3218.88 --> 3228.6400000000003
which one shall i use

3222.559 --> 3228.6400000000003
this one yeah sure why not

3229.119 --> 3237.839
it's a side view

3239.68 --> 3248.24
so this this is the rectangular looping

3244.72 --> 3250.16
realm from an outsider perspective

3248.24 --> 3250.4799999999996
because you're literally watching this

3250.16 --> 3253.52
from

3250.48 --> 3254.079
outside of the connected loop is the

3253.52 --> 3256.319
west

3254.079 --> 3258.0
so outside of the realm which is

3256.319 --> 3260.319
physically impossible

3258.0 --> 3261.599
to achieve that because you can't get

3260.319 --> 3265.839
outside of the realm

3261.599 --> 3265.839
except maybe with your spirit

3266.319 --> 3270.4
and maybe if you attempted it it would

3268.319 --> 3273.52
actually kind of look like this

3270.4 --> 3279.599
but if you look carefully the north

3273.52 --> 3283.28
is to the left the south is to the right

3279.599 --> 3286.559
that's how youtube is showing it yeah

3283.28 --> 3287.3590000000004
so yeah the southern cross is always

3286.559 --> 3290.48
going to be

3287.359 --> 3290.48
to your right

3291.28 --> 3298.4
and the polaris north point

3294.72 --> 3298.3999999999996
is always going to be to your left

3300.24 --> 3308.3999999999996
as it rotates appears to rotate

3303.839 --> 3308.4
around the observer at a constant rate

3308.88 --> 3315.6800000000003
right so that's just another way to

3312.24 --> 3321.1189999999997
to realize like yeah these stars

3315.68 --> 3324.48
it's not like oh you move slightly

3321.119 --> 3326.96
east or west and then suddenly like

3324.48 --> 3328.48
are you moving over a circle or are you

3326.96 --> 3328.799
moving in a straight line when you do

3328.48 --> 3331.839
that

3328.799 --> 3335.04
that's for starters and then right

3331.839 --> 3337.359
is the southern cross point rotating

3335.04 --> 3339.52
as you walk in a straight line is it

3337.359 --> 3341.839
rotating away

3339.52 --> 3343.04
from this singular direction that you

3341.839 --> 3345.2
thought was south

3343.04 --> 3349.68
i don't think so i think that's all a

3345.2 --> 3352.319
consequence of assuming you're on a disk

3349.68 --> 3355.9199999999996
literally to literally assume that and

3352.319 --> 3355.92
there is no real evidence for this

3359.599 --> 3363.839
all right let me find a good

3368.799 --> 3372.64
uh i use this

3373.2 --> 3377.839
no one

3386.0 --> 3405.839
right here's another view of it

3389.04 --> 3405.839
hold on let me switch it

3410.559 --> 3418.3190000000004
right this is from a south point of view

3415.04 --> 3422.0
but yeah i didn't draw the rest of what

3418.319 --> 3425.04
might be beyond the north and the south

3422.0 --> 3433.839
because there is no detailed

3425.04 --> 3433.839
model of it of that surface

3460.799 --> 3467.2
yes brazil yes

3464.079 --> 3470.6400000000003
they should be parallel if

3467.2 --> 3471.04
it is if the non-spatial layout of the

3470.64 --> 3474.24
realm

3471.04 --> 3476.119
is indeed exactly rectangular

3474.24 --> 3479.52
now it might also have some weird

3476.119 --> 3479.52
irregularities to it

3479.68 --> 3487.2
so that it might slightly change angle

3484.0 --> 3489.839
right depends on what the real realm

3487.2 --> 3489.839
layout is

3492.24 --> 3502.64
because for example let me

3495.68 --> 3505.68
show you another one

3502.64 --> 3505.68
if it's like this

3506.16 --> 3519.68
then it's completely different

3516.88 --> 3520.96
right then there would if it is

3519.68 --> 3522.64
literally this

3520.96 --> 3524.799
interconnected loop east to west

3522.64 --> 3527.7599999999998
irregularly like an arc

3524.799 --> 3529.68
then yeah as you would walk in a literal

3527.76 --> 3532.3190000000004
euclidean straight line

3529.68 --> 3534.16
then the southern cross should move

3532.319 --> 3536.88
slightly

3534.16 --> 3538.5589999999997
slightly it's just not going to be a

3536.88 --> 3541.52
full

3538.559 --> 3543.3590000000004
a full surrounding of 380 degrees like

3541.52 --> 3545.839
this

3543.359 --> 3545.839
right

3555.76 --> 3559.3590000000004
how can the sun circle without flipping

3558.799 --> 3561.52
to

3559.359 --> 3563.92
because it's literally interconnected

3561.52 --> 3566.64
and the sun is purely holographic

3563.92 --> 3568.079
it has no literal position there is no

3566.64 --> 3571.5989999999997
flipping

3568.079 --> 3571.599
it just appears

3571.76 --> 3578.0
to the observer in relation to the the

3574.96 --> 3578.0
layout of the realm

3579.2 --> 3584.16
there's no physical thing literally

3581.44 --> 3586.799
moving from one spot to another

3584.16 --> 3587.52
the sun has no position it only has an

3586.799 --> 3591.599
angular

3587.52 --> 3601.839
apparent position to observers

3591.599 --> 3601.839
there's no actual position you can prove

3609.2 --> 3629.839
right anyway

3614.319 --> 3629.839
good to show that again

3641.119 --> 3648.319
ah yeah do you know that physical

3644.319 --> 3651.119
distances between meridians gets smaller

3648.319 --> 3653.52
oh really do they i'd like to see some

3651.119 --> 3656.6400000000003
definitive evidence for that

3653.52 --> 3661.28
like what is the actual interconnection

3656.64 --> 3665.68
of the surface how does that lay out

3661.28 --> 3665.6800000000003
but yeah it could be even

3665.839 --> 3671.119
in the looping arc realm model that i

3669.359 --> 3673.119
just showed

3671.119 --> 3675.359
because that's the case right there

3673.119 --> 3675.359
right

3677.76 --> 3684.2400000000002
rectangular looping

3681.119 --> 3687.839
is to me what

3684.24 --> 3690.9599999999996
the flat earth disc is to the

3687.839 --> 3692.24
first layer of flat earthing it's just

3690.96 --> 3694.319
to get your mind

3692.24 --> 3696.5589999999997
out of like the heliocentric way of

3694.319 --> 3699.2
thinking giving a quick alternative to

3696.559 --> 3702.4
latch onto so you don't get too dis

3699.2 --> 3705.2799999999997
dislocated and confused

3702.4 --> 3707.839
rectangular looping is just to introduce

3705.28 --> 3710.2400000000002
the looping factor and make you

3707.839 --> 3711.359
imagine it in the easiest fashion

3710.24 --> 3713.4399999999996
because

3711.359 --> 3715.44
it's in my personal opinion it's

3713.44 --> 3717.599
actually kind of unlikely that it is

3715.44 --> 3717.92
just perfectly rectangular looping like

3717.599 --> 3720.48
that

3717.92 --> 3727.119
it's much more likely irregular looping

3720.48 --> 3729.76
in ways

3727.119 --> 3731.76
but yeah i'm in the middle of trying to

3729.76 --> 3734.1600000000003
make people understand this

3731.76 --> 3734.7990000000004
for a couple of years now right but in

3734.16 --> 3740.24
this

3734.799 --> 3743.599
setup in this looping irregular layout

3740.24 --> 3745.68
yeah there is smaller space

3743.599 --> 3747.839
to the north there is less space before

3745.68 --> 3752.64
the loop

3747.839 --> 3752.64
loops it in on itself so this is like a

3752.839 --> 3757.44
irregular like a cut of a disc like it's

3755.68 --> 3760.24
part of a disc but you end up in the

3757.44 --> 3760.2400000000002
same place

3761.28 --> 3767.039
every time before you finish

3764.72 --> 3768.16
the full arc before you finish the full

3767.039 --> 3771.599
circle

3768.16 --> 3773.2799999999997
right so yeah what you claimed there i

3771.599 --> 3783.839
don't know if it's actually true

3773.28 --> 3783.8390000000004
yeah that fits this model

3806.88 --> 3812.96
all right

3810.079 --> 3812.96
that's nice

3822.079 --> 3827.76
all right well i don't know much about

3826.16 --> 3829.92
the the whole calculation

3827.76 --> 3832.0
you're probably just doing a basic

3829.92 --> 3835.839
calculation with that

3832.0 --> 3837.68
and that's fine but what you're stating

3835.839 --> 3840.48
basically fits what i'm showing on

3837.68 --> 3840.48
screen right now

3851.68 --> 3858.0
an awful lot of made of really you're

3855.039 --> 3859.599
gonna go there tiny wumbo

3858.0 --> 3862.16
after everything we've been through

3859.599 --> 3865.52
you're gonna do that

3862.16 --> 3880.0789999999997
no this is not just fantasy this

3865.52 --> 3883.28
is trying to figure it out

3880.079 --> 3884.1600000000003
okay brazil you can stop now yeah you

3883.28 --> 3886.7200000000003
made your point

3884.16 --> 3889.0389999999998
yeah there's differences i'm literally

3886.72 --> 3892.3999999999996
showing on screen

3889.039 --> 3893.039
where that if you project the map we

3892.4 --> 3895.839
know

3893.039 --> 3896.559
into this model that will probably work

3895.839 --> 3899.2799999999997
out

3896.559 --> 3900.6400000000003
with everything you're now calculating

3899.28 --> 3909.8390000000004
okay

3900.64 --> 3909.839
so you can stop now

3912.48 --> 3915.599
right and if you don't like this model

3914.24 --> 3917.839
if you're gonna assume that

3915.599 --> 3920.6400000000003
way further to the south you're actually

3917.839 --> 3924.48
gonna get closer

3920.64 --> 3927.68
as well then there's another one

3924.48 --> 3930.2400000000002
there's another one for you

3927.68 --> 3932.0
right this is not the only option it's

3930.24 --> 3937.5989999999997
just that this one

3932.0 --> 3941.039
would make it seem like a halfway disk

3937.599 --> 3941.039
right you can also

3941.2 --> 3947.2
take this one and then you got both

3945.039 --> 3949.3590000000004
situations on both sides this would be

3947.2 --> 3951.2799999999997
the most suggestive that it might be

3949.359 --> 3954.88
interconnected like a globe this is like

3951.28 --> 3954.88
a flat globe model

3956.4 --> 3963.119
cite and sign and date these drawings

3960.079 --> 3964.0
they're just sketches and i've been

3963.119 --> 3968.2400000000002
using them for

3964.0 --> 3968.24
a while on my shows

3974.16 --> 3979.839
they're not that special

3985.76 --> 3989.5200000000004
two poles infinite plane

3991.68 --> 3995.359
infinite no there is no infinity in

3993.92 --> 3999.119
physical reality

3995.359 --> 4001.839
terminoid but there might be more

3999.119 --> 4002.88
right that's what this suggests that's

4001.839 --> 4006.0
part of this model

4002.88 --> 4008.88
is the i keep it on there the idea

4006.0 --> 4010.96
that there is more room to the north and

4008.88 --> 4012.2400000000002
south now how would there be more room

4010.96 --> 4014.319
how would that connect

4012.24 --> 4015.2799999999997
could it be that these connection points

4014.319 --> 4017.2799999999997
like this

4015.28 --> 4018.48
model specifically shows are like kind

4017.28 --> 4021.76
of cut off

4018.48 --> 4024.64
and they could be opened like doors

4021.76 --> 4025.5200000000004
that sometimes open towards the other

4024.64 --> 4029.2
realm

4025.52 --> 4029.92
right like i actually have explanations

4029.2 --> 4032.24
for these

4029.92 --> 4033.52
kind of conceptions right how many

4032.24 --> 4036.64
people out there

4033.52 --> 4039.68
have figured out something whatever

4036.64 --> 4048.319
that actually mechanically addresses

4039.68 --> 4051.5989999999997
any of that i don't know a single one

4048.319 --> 4055.359
okay well steamy traveler that's fine

4051.599 --> 4055.3590000000004
if if you want

4055.52 --> 4064.48
a copy of it signed by arwin to hang

4059.359 --> 4064.48
on your wall that is cool i'll do it

4068.799 --> 4075.7599999999998
right and to top it off not

4072.72 --> 4078.799
perfect top down view this is rather

4075.76 --> 4078.7990000000004
in between view

4080.079 --> 4084.96
this is still perspective based view i'm

4083.039 --> 4089.92
gonna present

4084.96 --> 4092.799
the last one the ring looping rings

4089.92 --> 4096.64
where each realm segment is exactly

4092.799 --> 4098.48
the same ring and it fits

4096.64 --> 4100.64
in between the other ring even though

4098.48 --> 4105.12
that should technically not fit but it

4100.64 --> 4107.839
still does

4105.12 --> 4108.3189999999995
realms of the same size that contain a

4107.839 --> 4110.799
realm

4108.319 --> 4111.839000000001
within it that is the same size and

4110.799 --> 4115.44
contains a realm

4111.839 --> 4119.2789999999995
outside of it that is also the same size

4115.44 --> 4122.159
right to to get really loopy

4119.279 --> 4133.839000000001
to make things extra surreal this might

4122.159 --> 4133.839
also be the way it works

4170.4 --> 4178.96
in my drawing south north direction

4174.799 --> 4178.96
the closer to the edge

4179.12 --> 4184.48
the more isn't straight line

4186.839 --> 4189.839
what

4192.719 --> 4203.84
well that's why the models that i've

4194.64 --> 4203.84
been showing are irregular looping

4204.32 --> 4209.12
right these are irregular looping

4214.84 --> 4222.64
systems

4217.44 --> 4224.639999999999
right and this is another picture

4222.64 --> 4227.360000000001
also perspective view where it is

4224.64 --> 4227.360000000001
rectangular

4227.6 --> 4231.4400000000005
and then yeah there wouldn't be any

4230.239 --> 4233.599999999999
curve

4231.44 --> 4237.04
to the south it this is all perfect

4233.6 --> 4237.04
straight lines east to west

4238.239 --> 4245.839999999999
with kind of an imagination and content

4242.84 --> 4245.84
beyond

4256.84 --> 4259.84
right

4262.79 --> 4265.899
[Music]

4266.159 --> 4274.5599999999995
a radar can see between rings

4270.88 --> 4277.52
uh well the ring is only

4274.56 --> 4279.360000000001
this is a visualization of the layout

4277.52 --> 4282.719
because it's all perfectly flat

4279.36 --> 4286.0
interconnected radar is just gonna move

4282.719 --> 4289.52
based on the vantage point

4286.0 --> 4291.76
so unless the loop is caught off

4289.52 --> 4293.040000000001
in between and you can only measure

4291.76 --> 4295.84
things through that

4293.04 --> 4297.36
tight loop angle well radar would pick

4295.84 --> 4300.4800000000005
that up

4297.36 --> 4304.239
radar would look just follow the loop

4300.48 --> 4307.839999999999
as well however it's arranged

4304.239 --> 4312.839999999999
you can only see beyond if there is

4307.84 --> 4315.84
a spatial gap in order to scan

4312.84 --> 4315.84
beyond

4322.83 --> 4329.44
[Music]

4325.679 --> 4331.12
in the last one north directions

4329.44 --> 4333.678999999999
south and north directions weren't

4331.12 --> 4333.679
parallel

4334.48 --> 4346.159
no no they weren't that's right

4342.56 --> 4348.64
that's right yeah because hey brazil

4346.159 --> 4350.879999999999
brazil i'm just saying with the

4348.64 --> 4353.92
rectangular setup

4350.88 --> 4357.4400000000005
that's an insistence for your

4353.92 --> 4360.56
mind to try to grasp the concept

4357.44 --> 4363.919999999999
i'm not making a claim this is the

4360.56 --> 4367.679
counter argument right

4363.92 --> 4370.96
because my main argument is that

4367.679 --> 4374.159
all of the stars planet sun and moon are

4370.96 --> 4377.04
holographic and display themselves

4374.159 --> 4379.759999999999
in relation to the observer based on an

4377.04 --> 4382.96
oscillating system

4379.76 --> 4385.6
that coincides with the realm layout

4382.96 --> 4387.52
and how it's interconnected over

4385.6 --> 4391.1990000000005
distances

4387.52 --> 4394.56
right yeah it can

4391.199 --> 4394.879999999999
just be in some literal way a disk it's

4394.56 --> 4396.4800000000005
a

4394.88 --> 4398.32
remains an option i don't think it's

4396.48 --> 4401.12
likely but it remains an option

4398.32 --> 4402.0
and then wherever south is going to

4401.12 --> 4404.4
appear to be

4402.0 --> 4405.12
is where the southern cross will display

4404.4 --> 4408.239
itself

4405.12 --> 4408.96
because it will just physically move

4408.239 --> 4412.799999999999
around

4408.96 --> 4415.6
you as you go around

4412.8 --> 4416.320000000001
the literal euclidean direction will

4415.6 --> 4419.120000000001
alter

4416.32 --> 4420.799999999999
based on your position and your vantage

4419.12 --> 4423.36
point as a viewer

4420.8 --> 4423.84
that would happen because it can happen

4423.36 --> 4426.88
because

4423.84 --> 4429.76
none of these light bodies are

4426.88 --> 4430.400000000001
physical and literally in a location

4429.76 --> 4433.280000000001
none of them

4430.4 --> 4435.679
are they're all holographic revealing

4433.28 --> 4437.04
themselves in relation to the observer

4435.679 --> 4439.76
specifically

4437.04 --> 4441.12
nothing about it is physical in a

4439.76 --> 4444.08
literal position

4441.12 --> 4454.5599999999995
nothing about it right that is my main

4444.08 --> 4456.08
argument brazil

4454.56 --> 4459.120000000001
how many possible models have you

4456.08 --> 4462.96
conceived and depicted

4459.12 --> 4464.88
dude well yeah

4462.96 --> 4466.32
how far can there's all kinds of

4464.88 --> 4468.4800000000005
possibilities right

4466.32 --> 4469.84
literally there's a whole bun a range of

4468.48 --> 4472.879999999999
things

4469.84 --> 4475.76
how it could be like depending

4472.88 --> 4479.36
on the data how it interconnects right

4475.76 --> 4479.360000000001
so the more we explore

4479.52 --> 4484.56
the literal euclidean distances of

4482.64 --> 4486.0
locations on earth including ocean

4484.56 --> 4489.1990000000005
bottom and try to grid

4486.0 --> 4491.679
connect it in a model

4489.199 --> 4494.48
the more cleared up it will become what

4491.679 --> 4498.2390000000005
the actual orientation is

4494.48 --> 4501.36
of the realm how it is laid out

4498.239 --> 4502.32
if it is a literal disc or if it is

4501.36 --> 4505.92
looping

4502.32 --> 4505.92
rectangular irregular

4507.6 --> 4511.280000000001
or like a weird ring situation like

4510.239 --> 4514.959999999999
those are all

4511.28 --> 4525.84
legitimate options based on the outcome

4514.96 --> 4525.84
of the surface measurements

4528.52 --> 4531.799000000001
[Music]

4532.8 --> 4536.96
but the globe model is not the one yeah

4534.96 --> 4540.44
no [ __ ] there's no curvature

4536.96 --> 4544.159
eliminator it's flat it is

4540.44 --> 4548.48
definitively flat there's no other

4544.159 --> 4550.96
surface geometry that is possible

4548.48 --> 4553.36
because if it were we would not get the

4550.96 --> 4556.2390000000005
black swan photographs and we do

4553.36 --> 4557.92
all the time all the time the farther

4556.239 --> 4559.44
you can see the more of a black swan

4557.92 --> 4563.4400000000005
photograph it is

4559.44 --> 4567.04
it's flat it's very very freaking flat

4563.44 --> 4569.919999999999
all the time flat

4567.04 --> 4571.6
is the geometrical surface orientation

4569.92 --> 4574.32
that is absolutely stable

4571.6 --> 4576.400000000001
is not going to be warped in any way it

4574.32 --> 4578.88
is what it is it stays what it is it's

4576.4 --> 4582.48
stationary it stays what it is

4578.88 --> 4585.6
but however the surface is connected

4582.48 --> 4588.239
that is still up to be figured out it's

4585.6 --> 4595.84
part of the mystery to figure that out

4588.239 --> 4595.839999999999
but that it's flat is fact

4597.12 --> 4602.4
right and with all your globe model

4600.8 --> 4605.12
appeal but it so it

4602.4 --> 4607.44
fits the model yeah it's still flat

4605.12 --> 4608.8
right so hey who knows maybe it's a flat

4607.44 --> 4611.678999999999
globe

4608.8 --> 4612.56
i literally said it in my first live

4611.679 --> 4616.4
stream

4612.56 --> 4619.6
ever a flat globe

4616.4 --> 4624.08
wouldn't that be ironic yeah

4619.6 --> 4626.0
it's a possibility it's still flat

4624.08 --> 4627.679
right might interconnect like a globe

4626.0 --> 4630.64
it's still flat

4627.679 --> 4631.679
get over it oh that makes no sense to

4630.64 --> 4634.64
you oh that's like

4631.679 --> 4635.76
oh yeah i know no [ __ ] right flat globe

4634.64 --> 4638.64
means

4635.76 --> 4640.159000000001
looping means spatially irregular

4638.64 --> 4643.84
looping means

4640.159 --> 4645.44
a potential looping realm beads set up

4643.84 --> 4648.719
of the layout of the realm the one that

4645.44 --> 4648.719
i showed right

4648.96 --> 4655.84
that's what it means it's never

4652.08 --> 4659.84
ever going to turn out to be a physical

4655.84 --> 4664.159000000001
literal euclidean geometry

4659.84 --> 4666.64
ball never it's not that ball it never

4664.159 --> 4668.5599999999995
will be that ball it will never turn out

4666.64 --> 4671.52
to be that ball no matter what

4668.56 --> 4673.360000000001
it's not that ball right it's flat all

4671.52 --> 4677.1990000000005
of it it's flat

4673.36 --> 4679.199
but hey how what is there

4677.199 --> 4680.96
how does it connect yeah that's the

4679.199 --> 4683.678999999999
mystery right

4680.96 --> 4686.0
not that whether it's flat or a ball

4683.679 --> 4687.1990000000005
because it's definitely not a literal

4686.0 --> 4690.8
ball

4687.199 --> 4693.28
it's not a physical literal

4690.8 --> 4694.2390000000005
round thing that's not what the earth is

4693.28 --> 4697.759999999999
it's flat

4694.239 --> 4699.36
no matter what it's flat right

4697.76 --> 4701.1990000000005
but that doesn't mean that we know

4699.36 --> 4702.96
everything about it just because we know

4701.199 --> 4705.599999999999
it's flat

4702.96 --> 4707.04
it's only a vantage point the anchor

4705.6 --> 4709.76
reality anchor

4707.04 --> 4711.92
to step away from the imagination of a

4709.76 --> 4714.08
physical literal geometry

4711.92 --> 4715.36
which would then inevitably have to just

4714.08 --> 4718.64
float

4715.36 --> 4719.28
in outer space because you can't even

4718.64 --> 4722.08
figure out

4719.28 --> 4723.12
any kind of imagination of how and why

4722.08 --> 4726.5599999999995
that would be

4723.12 --> 4729.36
a literal geometry in a realm it makes

4726.56 --> 4731.1990000000005
no damn sense none of it makes any sense

4729.36 --> 4733.839999999999
it's already quite miraculous that

4731.199 --> 4734.239
people have been successfully imagining

4733.84 --> 4736.96
ball

4734.239 --> 4739.12
in outer space for such a long time over

4736.96 --> 4749.84
generations that it works so well

4739.12 --> 4749.84
that's the miracle right

4753.84 --> 4757.679
looping a two-dimensional surface can't

4756.4 --> 4758.799999999999
be made with

4757.679 --> 4761.36
what are you talking about

4758.8 --> 4763.6
two-dimensional surface

4761.36 --> 4766.239
it's a three-dimensional world it's

4763.6 --> 4766.2390000000005
material

4766.32 --> 4771.28
it's not a two-dimensional surface it's

4769.52 --> 4777.84
just a flat surface

4771.28 --> 4777.84
in the 3d physical world

4782.64 --> 4786.96
no no steamy traveler nobody feels the

4785.92 --> 4790.4
loop the loop

4786.96 --> 4794.08
is the realm the loop is

4790.4 --> 4797.36
the realm it is the loop it is

4794.08 --> 4800.8
matter stuck in a spatial loop

4797.36 --> 4805.04
it seamlessly interconnects it is

4800.8 --> 4807.28
interconnected at all times

4805.04 --> 4809.28
there is no sensation there is no

4807.28 --> 4811.599999999999
doorway there is no edge

4809.28 --> 4813.599999999999
of the loop it's seamlessly

4811.6 --> 4816.320000000001
interconnected forever that

4813.6 --> 4817.4400000000005
is the form of the realm that is the

4816.32 --> 4820.88
form of the space

4817.44 --> 4823.919999999999
in which matter can exist there is no

4820.88 --> 4833.84
looping edge no portal it just connects

4823.92 --> 4833.84
seamlessly that's the loop

4837.93 --> 4844.84
[Music]

4842.639 --> 4846.96
yeah i'm not talking about

4844.84 --> 4849.76
two-dimensional geometry when i talk

4846.96 --> 4852.2390000000005
about flat eliminator don't straw man me

4849.76 --> 4854.0
i'm talking about a very specific

4852.239 --> 4857.28
orientation of a

4854.0 --> 4859.92
physical surface in the 3d world

4857.28 --> 4862.239
right the geometrical orientation is

4859.92 --> 4866.2390000000005
flat

4862.239 --> 4870.4
it's a seamlessly flat interconnecting

4866.239 --> 4872.638999999999
realm it's actually geometrically flat

4870.4 --> 4873.44
the surface the aspect of it of the

4872.639 --> 4877.28
geometry

4873.44 --> 4879.919999999999
is flat it's not

4877.28 --> 4881.599999999999
flat so it is two dimensional no that's

4879.92 --> 4883.84
a that's a red herring that's a straw

4881.6 --> 4883.84
man

4886.0 --> 4889.04
why are you bringing that up

4887.76 --> 4893.1990000000005
two-dimensional

4889.04 --> 4896.639
so what and one-dimensional is a dot

4893.199 --> 4898.96
that's all very nice so what or it's a

4896.639 --> 4898.96
line

4900.56 --> 4904.96
zero dimensional as a dot whatever

4907.76 --> 4911.84
it's not real two-dimensional doesn't

4910.96 --> 4915.36
exist

4911.84 --> 4918.08
it's a projection it's a conception

4915.36 --> 4920.0
it's a mathematical extract that you can

4918.08 --> 4924.719
use

4920.0 --> 4926.52
right it doesn't actually exist

4924.719 --> 4928.0
doesn't physically exist only

4926.52 --> 4931.040000000001
three-dimensional things

4928.0 --> 4933.12
physically exist because if they're

4931.04 --> 4936.159
something else then they're outside of

4933.12 --> 4936.159
physical realm

4942.84 --> 4945.84
reality

4947.95 --> 4951.09
[Music]

4952.08 --> 4963.199
oh my god oh my god

4958.8 --> 4963.1990000000005
oh brazil you're so stupid

4971.12 --> 4978.719
radar has places where it can't

4975.84 --> 4980.159000000001
see things not because it's a curve in

4978.719 --> 4982.639
the way

4980.159 --> 4983.679
just like when you look out there it's

4982.639 --> 4986.96
not a curve

4983.679 --> 4991.1990000000005
obstructing things that's just

4986.96 --> 4991.679
inherent for detecting things for seeing

4991.199 --> 4994.239
things

4991.679 --> 4995.12
right confirmed flat surfaces

4994.239 --> 4997.12
concealment

4995.12 --> 4998.239
it happens so if it's going to happen

4997.12 --> 5002.8
with sight

4998.239 --> 5005.12
no doubt the same thing counts for radar

5002.8 --> 5007.76
it might simply not have these same

5005.12 --> 5008.639
visual limits the refraction limit blur

5007.76 --> 5011.04
up thing

5008.639 --> 5013.12
might reach further still going to be

5011.04 --> 5014.159
subjected by the same effects because it

5013.12 --> 5016.639
is

5014.159 --> 5019.12
technically an observation radar is an

5016.639 --> 5021.04
observation effect

5019.12 --> 5022.96
right it's going to have the same

5021.04 --> 5026.0
consumer effect the bottom

5022.96 --> 5030.159
will seem to be obstructed it will

5026.0 --> 5033.199
limited resolution the angle it's just

5030.159 --> 5035.679
eventually gonna not

5033.199 --> 5036.239
exactly reach every part of the bottom

5035.679 --> 5040.08
because

5036.239 --> 5040.08
the angle it becomes too narrow

5040.8 --> 5043.92
probably going to be subjected by

5042.719 --> 5046.4
regular refraction

5043.92 --> 5047.28
mirror effects as well it's just not

5046.4 --> 5050.719
going to

5047.28 --> 5053.04
rip return an input

5050.719 --> 5053.84
has to reach all the way over there and

5053.04 --> 5055.76
all the way back

5053.84 --> 5071.84
in order to actually detect something

5055.76 --> 5071.84
with radar you do realize that right

5072.159 --> 5076.0
no steamy traveler you can never detect

5075.44 --> 5079.919999999999
the loop

5076.0 --> 5085.28
ever you can never detect the loop

5079.92 --> 5090.8
it is the space you're standing in

5085.28 --> 5093.5199999999995
right you cannot detect

5090.8 --> 5093.52
the walls

5094.8 --> 5100.159000000001
like that of a loop it's just how it

5098.08 --> 5101.44
connects you can never get outside of it

5100.159 --> 5104.638999999999
you can't connect it

5101.44 --> 5108.159
like you are in the loop literally

5104.639 --> 5112.159000000001
in it there is no thing to detect it

5108.159 --> 5114.4
you the space is the loop you see there

5112.159 --> 5115.04
is no part about it that is not part of

5114.4 --> 5118.4
the loop

5115.04 --> 5119.5199999999995
the whole thing is the loop you can't

5118.4 --> 5122.719
detect it never

5119.52 --> 5125.4400000000005
ever you can only figure out how it

5122.719 --> 5127.199
how the layout is how this space is

5125.44 --> 5130.719
arranged what is the available

5127.199 --> 5132.4
preponderance of space within the realm

5130.719 --> 5134.96
that's the only thing you can figure out

5132.4 --> 5141.839999999999
you can never detect the loop because it

5134.96 --> 5141.84
is the loop all of it is the loop

5152.84 --> 5155.84
so

5165.44 --> 5171.839999999999
come up with this to explain man

5168.719 --> 5175.52
land mass location what does that mean

5171.84 --> 5178.159000000001
no i've come up with spatial looping

5175.52 --> 5181.6
to figure out what the realm layout is

5178.159 --> 5185.5199999999995
what is the available space of the realm

5181.6 --> 5185.52
and how does it connect that's it

5188.48 --> 5197.839999999999
hey james mason pp is that

5191.52 --> 5197.84
paypal hmm

5202.6 --> 5205.659000000001
[Music]

5222.84 --> 5225.84
uh

5226.719 --> 5230.0
oh thank you very much

5230.159 --> 5235.839999999999
ralph rodriguez awesome

5233.28 --> 5238.639
thank you very much for the paypal i

5235.84 --> 5242.2390000000005
really appreciate it

5238.639 --> 5242.2390000000005
i'll get back to the conversation

5250.84 --> 5253.84
shortly

5258.48 --> 5261.44
don't reflect

5264.96 --> 5268.719
well they're still going to be subjected

5266.8 --> 5270.639
by bottom-up concealment effect

5268.719 --> 5272.4
because it is a form of detection

5270.639 --> 5273.52
everything is going to be subjected

5272.4 --> 5276.08
unless radar can

5273.52 --> 5277.1990000000005
literally go around corners right if

5276.08 --> 5279.28
that's your claim

5277.199 --> 5282.32
it can go around corners then yeah there

5279.28 --> 5286.48
would be no concealment to it whatsoever

5282.32 --> 5286.48
pretty sure it can't go around corners

5288.8 --> 5295.84
just not over long distance anyway

5297.04 --> 5301.04
right so yeah it's radar is very likely

5300.08 --> 5303.76
to be

5301.04 --> 5305.76
subjected to bottom-up consumer type

5303.76 --> 5307.92
effects causing a zone where it

5305.76 --> 5310.2390000000005
over distance just can't scan anymore

5307.92 --> 5313.12
because nothing's going to reflect

5310.239 --> 5313.12
you can't reach it

5319.12 --> 5326.0
talking about

5323.6 --> 5326.639
conflating physical loop a cyclical time

5326.0 --> 5329.84
no has

5326.639 --> 5333.4400000000005
nothing to do with each other whatsoever

5329.84 --> 5336.639
time has [ __ ] to do with space

5333.44 --> 5340.48
[ __ ] nothing absolutely nothing is

5336.639 --> 5342.88
nothing alike time is not a dimension

5340.48 --> 5343.839999999999
all the sci-fi [ __ ] coming out of that

5342.88 --> 5346.88
is completely

5343.84 --> 5347.28
horseshit all of it it's total waste of

5346.88 --> 5350.88
time

5347.28 --> 5352.88
horseshit i hate

5350.88 --> 5353.92
einstein for doing that actually

5352.88 --> 5356.84
although yeah it's

5353.92 --> 5358.0
interesting to the toy with it it's just

5356.84 --> 5361.12
completely

5358.0 --> 5364.719
and utterly useless because

5361.12 --> 5379.84
time is not a spatiality it isn't

5364.719 --> 5379.84
total horseshit

5383.44 --> 5388.4
mainstream claims whatever man i don't

5386.639 --> 5391.4400000000005
give a [ __ ] what they claim

5388.4 --> 5391.839999999999
they're a bunch of lying retards that

5391.44 --> 5394.48
just

5391.84 --> 5395.1990000000005
make up anything just kind of just a

5394.48 --> 5397.199
file

5395.199 --> 5399.12
fight that it has to be a ball it's the

5397.199 --> 5401.44
only [ __ ] thing they ever do anyway i

5399.12 --> 5403.679
don't give a [ __ ] what they say

5401.44 --> 5407.199
literally i don't give a [ __ ] what they

5403.679 --> 5410.2390000000005
say wiki or otherwise

5407.199 --> 5411.839999999999
like i might simply get it correct and

5410.239 --> 5414.5599999999995
then i'll use it to ram

5411.84 --> 5416.400000000001
somebody on the head with like look it's

5414.56 --> 5418.719
what even what it says right

5416.4 --> 5420.4
that's what i like to do other than that

5418.719 --> 5424.08
in my own endeavors

5420.4 --> 5427.5199999999995
who gives a [ __ ] what they say

5424.08 --> 5430.239
nobody's working on this nobody this is

5427.52 --> 5430.2390000000005
my project

5432.08 --> 5438.5599999999995
right they have nothing

5435.44 --> 5449.839999999999
to add to it all just

5438.56 --> 5449.84
ball refining bullshitters

5455.76 --> 5461.679
hmm right yeah thanks man round four to

5459.84 --> 5464.12
read guys i really appreciate it

5461.679 --> 5468.569
you're awesome

5464.12 --> 5468.5689999999995
[Music]

5471.6 --> 5475.120000000001
all right thanks for your invest sorry

5473.36 --> 5477.839999999999
if i get a little overpassionate it's

5475.12 --> 5477.84
just that

5480.48 --> 5485.839999999999
i get a little sensitive sometimes when

5482.639 --> 5485.84
people start prodding

5486.239 --> 5505.839999999999
right i feel like it's the ballers again

5489.36 --> 5505.839999999999
although it might be a flat earther

5507.12 --> 5513.44
hmm long distance microwave transmission

5510.639 --> 5515.76
140 miles

5513.44 --> 5515.759999999999
wow

5516.56 --> 5523.04
direct line of sight so

5519.76 --> 5523.52
that seems pretty flat to me 140 miles

5523.04 --> 5526.56
with no

5523.52 --> 5533.84
earth curve getting in the way that's

5526.56 --> 5533.84
incredible it's one wuzzle

5546.4 --> 5561.839999999999
all right iron 26 that's all fine

5565.52 --> 5569.84
right but as to your earlier question

5568.32 --> 5573.28
did you come up with this

5569.84 --> 5574.8
to explain man land mass location yes i

5573.28 --> 5577.92
have

5574.8 --> 5580.2390000000005
because the earth is flat the sights are

5577.92 --> 5582.96
there that's impossible on a ball like

5580.239 --> 5584.879999999999
absolutely impossible right but that

5582.96 --> 5587.92
still doesn't explain

5584.88 --> 5590.88
what it all is except for the surface

5587.92 --> 5594.96
geometrical aspect of it

5590.88 --> 5594.96
and there's all kinds of weirdness

5596.08 --> 5599.5199999999995
things that haven't been fully resolved

5598.96 --> 5604.08
right

5599.52 --> 5607.040000000001
like what is actually the equatorial

5604.08 --> 5607.76
line orientation like yeah i know it's

5607.04 --> 5610.08
celestial

5607.76 --> 5613.1990000000005
celestial they're right but what is it

5610.08 --> 5616.159
actually in euclidean space

5613.199 --> 5617.36
is it like what the baller suggests of

5616.159 --> 5620.159
course it isn't

5617.36 --> 5622.32
but anyway a straight line and then they

5620.159 --> 5624.879999999999
just assume it goes over a curve

5622.32 --> 5625.759999999999
all the time and then oh 360 degrees in

5624.88 --> 5627.76
a curve

5625.76 --> 5628.88
yeah but it they might be right that

5627.76 --> 5631.4400000000005
it's actually just

5628.88 --> 5634.159000000001
a literal euclidean straight line that

5631.44 --> 5636.96
could be a possibility

5634.159 --> 5637.44
if that turns out to be the case then

5636.96 --> 5640.4800000000005
space

5637.44 --> 5644.08
is not linear and there would have to be

5640.48 --> 5647.36
absolutely necessary inevitable a loop

5644.08 --> 5648.719
within the spatial realm within the

5647.36 --> 5651.04
space that we have

5648.719 --> 5651.76
it would be looping it would not be

5651.04 --> 5654.88
linear

5651.76 --> 5656.719
it would not be literal just like the

5654.88 --> 5660.56
heliocentric model suggests

5656.719 --> 5663.12
a ball inside of a literal open space

5660.56 --> 5665.360000000001
where everything is euclidean as is no

5663.12 --> 5665.92
no looping weird [ __ ] nothing it's all

5665.36 --> 5669.44
just as

5665.92 --> 5673.6
is exactly in a in a vast euclidean

5669.44 --> 5677.12
idea of space right

5673.6 --> 5679.04
i'm basically pointing out well in the

5677.12 --> 5681.28
figuring out of the orientation of the

5679.04 --> 5684.719
realm we may very well bump

5681.28 --> 5687.84
into elements that make that

5684.719 --> 5690.159
notion impossible that space

5687.84 --> 5692.639
cannot be linear because it's looping

5690.159 --> 5695.5199999999995
and there is no

5692.639 --> 5698.32
normal space is exactly as is

5695.52 --> 5700.159000000001
explanation to justify that

5698.32 --> 5701.679
whatsoever so what's gonna happen we're

5700.159 --> 5702.5599999999995
just gonna oh it doesn't make sense oh

5701.679 --> 5704.4800000000005
it's a ball it's a

5702.56 --> 5705.6
flat it's a bolt it's a flat disc ball

5704.48 --> 5708.32
flat disc and then

5705.6 --> 5709.119000000001
never get it resolved ever it would be

5708.32 --> 5712.96
stuck

5709.119 --> 5714.5599999999995
forever both sides would never resolve

5712.96 --> 5717.119
it right

5714.56 --> 5718.88
that's where i come in that's what i'm

5717.119 --> 5721.92
here for

5718.88 --> 5723.76
to find a way through where nobody

5721.92 --> 5726.84
thought to look

5723.76 --> 5729.84
that's what i do that's what i'm here

5726.84 --> 5729.84
for

5736.8 --> 5740.8
all right i'm gonna be back in two

5740.84 --> 5743.84
minutes

5824.84 --> 5827.84
ah

5828.4 --> 5841.839999999999
all right

5855.52 --> 5861.84
yeah brazil yeah you have to heighten up

5859.04 --> 5865.119
the signal because

5861.84 --> 5867.119000000001
perspective like effect supply angular

5865.119 --> 5871.92
resolution limit

5867.119 --> 5875.5199999999995
right signal angular signal resolution

5871.92 --> 5878.8
signal has to come back right yeah

5875.52 --> 5879.6
there's going to be consuming effect at

5878.8 --> 5881.679
the bottom

5879.6 --> 5883.92
when looking over a flat surface it's

5881.679 --> 5887.52
not earth curve getting in the way

5883.92 --> 5888.159
let it go brazil you're wrong it's not a

5887.52 --> 5891.280000000001
ball

5888.159 --> 5895.199
get over it it's flat black swan

5891.28 --> 5898.639
photographs prove it there is no curve

5895.199 --> 5898.638999999999
in the way and it should be

5906.56 --> 5912.8
how can you loop a flat sheet of paper

5909.44 --> 5918.0
well you can only do it by

5912.8 --> 5918.0
yeah just well

5922.8 --> 5927.84
here you have the flat p shape sheet of

5925.679 --> 5931.679
paper

5927.84 --> 5935.119000000001
and there you have a loop there you go

5931.679 --> 5936.08
right it's flat though but that's how it

5935.119 --> 5938.799999999999
interconnects

5936.08 --> 5940.239
it's literally flat every part right so

5938.8 --> 5943.6
this representation

5940.239 --> 5946.0
is not literal it's only to show you how

5943.6 --> 5949.04
the connection within the loop is

5946.0 --> 5951.6
it's like fourth dimensional spatially

5949.04 --> 5953.04
fourth dimensional a representation from

5951.6 --> 5955.119000000001
a fourth dimension

5953.04 --> 5956.88
to explain something in the third

5955.119 --> 5960.639
dimension the loop

5956.88 --> 5963.4400000000005
because literally it's like this

5960.639 --> 5963.84
or cut this in half stick it to this

5963.44 --> 5967.599999999999
side

5963.84 --> 5970.400000000001
and it's like that

5967.6 --> 5971.4400000000005
right because it's literally flat

5970.4 --> 5974.96
literally

5971.44 --> 5977.759999999999
it just seamlessly connects on this side

5974.96 --> 5980.4
with the other like an infinite

5977.76 --> 5994.71
interconnecting flat ring or the train

5980.4 --> 5997.36
man station in the matrix 3.

5994.71 --> 5999.6
[Music]

5997.36 --> 5999.599999999999
ah

6002.88 --> 6006.8
no no it's no longer i'm gonna ban you

6005.04 --> 6010.08
all you're [ __ ]

6006.8 --> 6012.4800000000005
elminator you're a [ __ ] you're a

6010.08 --> 6016.159
[ __ ] elminator

6012.48 --> 6017.44
sick of this [ __ ] your physicality

6016.159 --> 6022.48
assumption bias

6017.44 --> 6025.839999999999
garbage is getting really tiresome

6022.48 --> 6027.119
yeah already explain it to you i laid

6025.84 --> 6030.32
out

6027.119 --> 6031.719
exactly the angle of approach to the

6030.32 --> 6033.199
thought experiments to the

6031.719 --> 6034.96
representations

6033.199 --> 6036.879999999999
and you're just being an [ __ ] and

6034.96 --> 6040.159
really annoyingly stupid and i

6036.88 --> 6040.159000000001
am going to ban you

6040.48 --> 6045.28
yeah yeah that's right get the [ __ ] out

6043.28 --> 6050.159
of here i'm sick of you

6045.28 --> 6053.199
bye dumbass

6050.159 --> 6057.28
yeah so when you

6053.199 --> 6060.32
fantasize about wormholes in space right

6057.28 --> 6064.08
when you fantasize about that

6060.32 --> 6065.36
remember you connect the one part to the

6064.08 --> 6068.08
other and then

6065.36 --> 6068.719
paper like pencil through it that's the

6068.08 --> 6072.4
connection

6068.719 --> 6073.92
so does that mean that space outer space

6072.4 --> 6077.04
euclidean endless

6073.92 --> 6079.6
is literally that [ __ ] [ __ ] you

6077.04 --> 6080.239
think that in that example so popularly

6079.6 --> 6082.88
used in

6080.239 --> 6083.678999999999
all kinds of movies do you imagine a

6082.88 --> 6087.28
wormhole

6083.679 --> 6091.52
does that mean that space outer space

6087.28 --> 6094.4
is literally this [ __ ] [ __ ]

6091.52 --> 6095.52
no right i'm not gonna strawman you with

6094.4 --> 6098.32
that [ __ ]

6095.52 --> 6099.52
so don't strawman me when i try to

6098.32 --> 6101.759999999999
explain to you

6099.52 --> 6107.84
spatial non-linearity and looping realms

6101.76 --> 6107.84
okay [ __ ]

6118.84 --> 6121.84
ah

6126.8 --> 6133.4400000000005
you know i'm right so

6130.32 --> 6136.4
please leave your stupid fallback

6133.44 --> 6136.4
assumptions and

6136.679 --> 6141.679
imaginations of victory

6139.679 --> 6144.0
that everything i'm doing or anything

6141.679 --> 6147.119
i'm doing somehow

6144.0 --> 6148.159
this proves that it's not a ball you're

6147.119 --> 6150.239
absolutely

6148.159 --> 6153.28
[ __ ] if you think that and you're

6150.239 --> 6153.28
not welcome here

6154.8 --> 6159.1990000000005
yeah either you try to understand what

6157.84 --> 6162.2390000000005
i'm explaining

6159.199 --> 6163.599999999999
if you can't ask me to clarify if you're

6162.239 --> 6166.5599999999995
gonna do that [ __ ]

6163.6 --> 6168.320000000001
start strawmanning me with this [ __ ]

6166.56 --> 6171.4400000000005
because you don't understand and you're

6168.32 --> 6174.32
too stupid or too proud to ask

6171.44 --> 6176.0
for further explanation and point out

6174.32 --> 6177.759999999999
how you didn't understand it

6176.0 --> 6179.119
why didn't you figure out how you're not

6177.76 --> 6181.1990000000005
understanding something

6179.119 --> 6182.719
and then ask for help instead of being a

6181.199 --> 6185.839999999999
stupid proud little

6182.719 --> 6187.76
religious [ __ ] and think that just

6185.84 --> 6189.1990000000005
because you don't understand it means

6187.76 --> 6192.4800000000005
it's a ball again

6189.199 --> 6205.839999999999
like a stupid [ __ ] yeah

6192.48 --> 6205.839999999999
don't do that it's really annoying

6207.88 --> 6211.02
[Music]

6214.88 --> 6218.8
right great show today very happy with

6217.6 --> 6222.159000000001
it

6218.8 --> 6224.2390000000005
lots of lots of flat earth cosmogeny

6222.159 --> 6227.44
definitely gonna have to make a good

6224.239 --> 6227.44
title for it

6227.679 --> 6232.88
spatial looping guys think out loud with

6231.52 --> 6234.56
me about the title

6232.88 --> 6236.56
put something in chat you think would

6234.56 --> 6239.6
fit it still have five more minutes and

6236.56 --> 6239.6
then i'm gonna run out

6244.84 --> 6247.84
so

6248.03 --> 6251.1089999999995
[Applause]

6257.3 --> 6260.459
[Applause]

6269.37 --> 6272.42
[Music]

6281.6 --> 6292.159000000001
i like this

6288.639 --> 6295.6
yeah spatial non-linearity

6292.159 --> 6298.719
and looping realm confined dynamics

6295.6 --> 6302.159000000001
now that's a proper title

6298.719 --> 6304.27
awesome that's what this show is going

6302.159 --> 6307.348999999999
to be called

6304.27 --> 6307.349
[Music]

6309.28 --> 6312.88
has your looping theory been generally

6311.36 --> 6317.28
accepted by

6312.88 --> 6319.52
fe community no

6317.28 --> 6319.5199999999995
no

6321.92 --> 6326.719
i don't think so i think

6324.96 --> 6328.159
i give probably a whole bunch of people

6326.719 --> 6331.199
a headache still

6328.159 --> 6333.44
even though i keep on trying to explain

6331.199 --> 6336.4
it for years and years and years

6333.44 --> 6336.96
i i am consistent there's some people

6336.4 --> 6339.44
that do

6336.96 --> 6341.119
actually understand and they quickly

6339.44 --> 6343.04
feedback

6341.119 --> 6344.239
that they understand how they understand

6343.04 --> 6347.76
it

6344.239 --> 6348.159
and also with it the insight that i'm

6347.76 --> 6352.159000000001
still

6348.159 --> 6356.239
building it i'm literally doing it live

6352.159 --> 6358.719
i am not going by some playbook

6356.239 --> 6360.4
that was all pre-written where i know

6358.719 --> 6362.2390000000005
exactly where it's going

6360.4 --> 6363.44
because it was already written and i'm

6362.239 --> 6366.799999999999
playing it out no

6363.44 --> 6369.44
i'm literally building it as i go

6366.8 --> 6371.28
recycling through old stuff trying to

6369.44 --> 6372.4
fit new things trying to find a way

6371.28 --> 6374.88
through figuring

6372.4 --> 6377.599999999999
details out spotting new things that's

6374.88 --> 6377.6
what i'm doing

6381.92 --> 6386.0
by anyone beside you well my dad thinks

6385.44 --> 6388.879999999999
it's really

6386.0 --> 6389.28
interesting and so does my friend deny

6388.88 --> 6391.04
me

6389.28 --> 6392.48
yeah there are a couple of really smart

6391.04 --> 6396.0
people

6392.48 --> 6396.5599999999995
that that do have that have taken the

6396.0 --> 6400.719
room

6396.56 --> 6402.159000000001
to figure it out that do appreciate also

6400.719 --> 6403.92
because they're not they

6402.159 --> 6406.0
i'm the only one that have to talk about

6403.92 --> 6408.8
it they don't have a bunch of

6406.0 --> 6409.199
stupid wankers out there like i do

6408.8 --> 6411.52
through

6409.199 --> 6414.0
the show with all the trolls they're

6411.52 --> 6417.360000000001
gonna nag the [ __ ] out of them for

6414.0 --> 6418.32
it right they can just talk about it

6417.36 --> 6420.88
with me

6418.32 --> 6421.679
and not have all the nagging from

6420.88 --> 6424.4800000000005
everybody

6421.679 --> 6426.56
right so yeah there are definitely

6424.48 --> 6428.159
people that do understand it

6426.56 --> 6430.4800000000005
it's just they're not picking up the

6428.159 --> 6433.28
fight they're not trying to make people

6430.48 --> 6434.239
understand which is like a desperate

6433.28 --> 6436.159
endeavor

6434.239 --> 6438.159
in this world where everybody is

6436.159 --> 6441.92
actively being courage to go

6438.159 --> 6444.239
full [ __ ] all the time with everything

6441.92 --> 6444.2390000000005
yeah

6449.52 --> 6453.52
so yeah there are people that do

6452.08 --> 6455.5199999999995
understand it

6453.52 --> 6457.040000000001
it's just that nobody's really

6455.52 --> 6460.400000000001
specializing in it

6457.04 --> 6463.84
to really get it figured out to grasp

6460.4 --> 6465.92
the dynamics and how to engage

6463.84 --> 6469.52
in the process of actually figuring it

6465.92 --> 6472.32
out how it really works in the realm

6469.52 --> 6474.400000000001
do you would know anybody besides myself

6472.32 --> 6478.719
i don't

6474.4 --> 6481.759999999999
but that's fine i can manage

6478.719 --> 6484.0
i'm developing in a way

6481.76 --> 6485.76
ironically i am probably going to

6484.0 --> 6486.88
basically end up the king of this

6485.76 --> 6490.400000000001
concept

6486.88 --> 6490.400000000001
because nobody else is doing it

6491.28 --> 6494.4
because they can't handle it it's too

6492.96 --> 6498.2390000000005
much for them

6494.4 --> 6500.5599999999995
oh yeah i'm a wizard i'm an elf wizard

6498.239 --> 6502.799999999999
i can do this i know myself i trust

6500.56 --> 6503.119000000001
myself and more importantly i don't give

6502.8 --> 6508.0
a

6503.119 --> 6511.44
[ __ ] that 99.999999999

6508.0 --> 6512.8
of all humanity doesn't even begin to

6511.44 --> 6513.199
understand what the hell i'm talking

6512.8 --> 6516.2390000000005
about

6513.199 --> 6519.44
i don't care i'm gonna figure it out

6516.239 --> 6520.0
and however long it takes eventually

6519.44 --> 6522.96
people

6520.0 --> 6524.84
will figure me out who knows maybe

6522.96 --> 6527.44
they're gonna see me like the freaking

6524.84 --> 6529.6
weird flat earth michelangelo or

6527.44 --> 6531.28
whatever fine that's fine right

6529.6 --> 6533.280000000001
it's all probably going to be after i'm

6531.28 --> 6535.119
dead it takes that long for people to

6533.28 --> 6537.199
figure [ __ ] out

6535.119 --> 6539.5199999999995
or maybe not maybe it will be within my

6537.199 --> 6540.32
lifetime it just takes a long time for a

6539.52 --> 6542.8
whole

6540.32 --> 6544.5599999999995
bunch of people and i knew that when i

6542.8 --> 6546.320000000001
was gonna start it like yeah i'm going

6544.56 --> 6548.56
to be

6546.32 --> 6550.5599999999995
received at first like i'm a complete

6548.56 --> 6552.400000000001
crazy person

6550.56 --> 6554.400000000001
like really great not just flat earth

6552.4 --> 6557.598999999999
crazy but even like

6554.4 --> 6558.879999999999
worse like even the flat earthers would

6557.599 --> 6562.32
think i'm a crazy person

6558.88 --> 6565.119
that's fine i am kind of crazy in a way

6562.32 --> 6566.159
it's just i have control over it i know

6565.119 --> 6567.679
what i'm doing
