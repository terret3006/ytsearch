for the patreon support

429.06 --> 431.72
uh

440.699 --> 442.819
what

444.56 --> 452.599
200k subscribers guy is starting a

449.22 --> 452.59900000000005
rivalry how does that work

474.479 --> 476.599
um

479.34 --> 484.81899999999996
I think it might get noisy somewhere in

482.22 --> 484.819
the next hour

484.919 --> 488.87899999999996
I think they're gonna like wash the

486.599 --> 491.71999999999997
windows here with machine or whatever

488.879 --> 491.72
we'll see

501.72 --> 505.16
right anyway uh

509.819 --> 514.86
I have to warn you guys I feel pretty

512.76 --> 517.019
okay but at the same time I'm a little

514.86 --> 518.399
nauseated

517.019 --> 522.419
inside

518.399 --> 526.14
took a bad drink yesterday night did it

522.419 --> 528.66
way too late and yeah poof

526.14 --> 531.06
so I feel a little weird but I know for

528.66 --> 535.1999999999999
sure that it's gonna go away

531.06 --> 538.8599999999999
during the day just have to be careful

535.2 --> 540.899
so I might just suddenly step away and

538.86 --> 543.5600000000001
start like walking on the balcony to get

540.899 --> 543.56
some fresh air

550.88 --> 556.5
so yeah I don't think I'm gonna get

553.44 --> 558.6600000000001
super psychological today

556.5 --> 561.08
because I currently do not have the

558.66 --> 561.0799999999999
stamina

562.38 --> 566.959
hold on I'll be back in two minutes

716.88 --> 719.88
laughs

723.36 --> 726.6800000000001
right I'm back

727.079 --> 731.7199999999999
hey Zach good to see you in chat

736.74 --> 740.4590000000001
right I also watched back my own show

738.959 --> 744.8599999999999
yesterday

740.459 --> 744.8599999999999
and it was really satisfied with it

750.899 --> 756.18
but right now I'm not at my strongest

753.54 --> 759.139
it's my own fault

756.18 --> 759.1389999999999
I'll be okay

772.74 --> 777.779
Ah that's a good one

774.92 --> 780.959
lies of like a virus

777.779 --> 783.48
needs a living host in order to perceive

780.959 --> 785.88
be perceived as credible

783.48 --> 789.66
right well that's the idea of a virus

785.88 --> 792.12
right but yeah actual viruses that

789.66 --> 794.899
doesn't exist so even the LIE of the

792.12 --> 794.899
virus is

795.18 --> 798.18
foreign

832.98 --> 836.839
so yeah how are you guys all doing

849.6 --> 857.0
I did watch a video

852.959 --> 857.0
very much broke again the video

857.88 --> 862.459
it's like UFO disclosure stuff

872.04 --> 877.8199999999999
and it was interesting but it's also

875.04 --> 877.8199999999999
yeah

879.06 --> 884.88
yeah it's it's Dr Stephen Greer again

881.88 --> 887.76
and he is very much

884.88 --> 891.42
like tasked

887.76 --> 894.24
with continuing

891.42 --> 896.3389999999999
the aliens but also

894.24 --> 900.66
I don't know it's

896.339 --> 903.3800000000001
seems to be promoting it in a diplomatic

900.66 --> 903.38
fashion

903.779 --> 906.019
the

910.019 --> 912.68
uh

915.839 --> 920.6600000000001
I don't know why he's put the timestamp

918.18 --> 920.66
in there

922.8 --> 929.2199999999999
because I'll link it up on you

926.639 --> 932.399
I don't really want to talk about it

929.22 --> 934.5790000000001
it's it's weird I feel I feel like a

932.399 --> 934.579
little

936.0 --> 938.959
High nervous

939.24 --> 942.199
because of the

944.279 --> 948.019
the bad drink I had yesterday

949.019 --> 951.74
uh

954.06 --> 959.7199999999999
right so yeah you could check it out

956.16 --> 959.7199999999999
it's like one and a half hour video

959.94 --> 968.48
they brought forth some interesting new

963.18 --> 968.4799999999999
ideas within the setup of it though

972.12 --> 977.639
hey stallion 8012

975.3 --> 979.88
how am I doing today well I've been

977.639 --> 979.88
better

982.68 --> 986.06
I'm a little queasy

990.779 --> 994.399
but it is only temporary

1011.06 --> 1013.959
foreign

1022.54 --> 1028.6599999999999
if this continues by the way I might end

1025.459 --> 1028.66
up this show a little early

1028.939 --> 1036.14
just pick up things again tomorrow

1033.079 --> 1039.9389999999999
sorry well it's

1036.14 --> 1039.939
it's my own damn fault you know

1079.58 --> 1082.6599999999999
hey clutch bear

1083.179 --> 1090.16
what's wrong well my intestines are just

1086.0 --> 1090.16
like really over sensitive right now

1101.24 --> 1106.1
but yeah I'll be all right

1103.88 --> 1108.14

as well as I have in the last few days

1112.46 --> 1117.679
ah

1115.4 --> 1121.48

1117.679 --> 1121.48
maybe it'll clear up I don't know

1191.36 --> 1196.299
I think after this I'm gonna take a

1193.7 --> 1196.299
steady walk

1197.32 --> 1202.0
because walking makes it feel better

1221.12 --> 1227.6789999999999
right and sitting on this chair doesn't

1223.34 --> 1227.6789999999999

1891.44 --> 1894.8200000000002
what's occurring

1895.399 --> 1899.5
yeah I'm having a bit of a

1901.1 --> 1904.6
bit of a bad morning

1904.82 --> 1909.5
because of some bad alcohol I drank

1906.98 --> 1912.519
yesterday night

1909.5 --> 1912.519
should have known better

1912.98 --> 1919.779
it's nothing like I'm not really

1915.799 --> 1919.779
terrible it's just that

1923.24 --> 1928.519
when it hits a bad spot then in the

1926.0 --> 1930.74
morning then it gets like really over

1928.519 --> 1933.44
sensitive to things it's weird

1930.74 --> 1937.279
break out in sweat very quickly

1933.44 --> 1939.14
and my intestines just feel very feeble

1937.279 --> 1944.059
it's weird

1939.14 --> 1946.519
but I know it goes away it always does

1944.059 --> 1951.519
usually it takes

1946.519 --> 1951.519
a couple of hours sometimes half the day

1956.419 --> 1961.279
but yeah I will be perfectly fine

1958.82 --> 1963.7
tomorrow perfectly fine don't worry

1961.279 --> 1963.7
about it

1965.5 --> 1970.539
moonshot well no it's actually absent

1971.36 --> 1975.6789999999999

14 years ago

1985.7 --> 1991.6000000000001

2124.839 --> 2132.119
problem and that problem is that when I

2127.96 --> 2132.119
drink just a little too much

2132.4 --> 2138.099
I just really notice it even if it's

2134.8 --> 2144.099
just a little like I'm just very very

2138.099 --> 2144.099
sensitive to elbow which is kind of nice

2144.22 --> 2149.2799999999997
but it also makes it a bit of a hassle

2146.38 --> 2149.28
when I'm not careful

2168.16 --> 2176.04
yeah it's hard to avoid alcohol when you

2170.859 --> 2176.04
live that close to Germany this is okay

2182.8 --> 2188.3390000000004
that's that's a weird thing to say but

2185.74 --> 2188.339
funny

2198.88 --> 2201.06
foreign

2220.32 --> 2226.3590000000004
why did why

2223.54 --> 2228.88
people are just busy and chat talking I

2226.359 --> 2231.66
don't think any look

2228.88 --> 2234.099
you just sometimes make kind of stupid

2231.66 --> 2236.5
sarcastic jokes

2234.099 --> 2240.099
and I personally don't really appreciate

2236.5 --> 2242.32
it I don't think most people really care

2240.099 --> 2245.56
I just don't like it when you do that

2242.32 --> 2248.6800000000003
that's all I don't think it's like you

2245.56 --> 2250.24
need to apologize no it's just a bad

2248.68 --> 2253.4199999999996
habit

2250.24 --> 2256.4199999999996

2253.42 --> 2260.339

you support that

3002.46 --> 3005.839
that's [ __ ] up dude

3006.66 --> 3014.0
that's [ __ ] up you you realize that

3010.22 --> 3014.0
lgbtq [ __ ]

3014.24 --> 3020.54
that's communist culture it's literally

3017.579 --> 3020.54
there to

3020.76 --> 3027.6800000000003
try to destroy Society that's literally

3024.66 --> 3027.68
what it's there for

3027.78 --> 3030.5
biblical

3030.54 --> 3036.859
I would seriously reconsider supporting

3034.559 --> 3036.8590000000004
that

3066.3 --> 3070.389
come on

3067.27 --> 3070.389
[Music]

3074.24 --> 3077.27
[Music]

3095.64 --> 3102.48
UK conservative party called it coming

3097.98 --> 3103.98
oh well it is communist literally it is

3102.48 --> 3107.28
communist

3103.98 --> 3110.0
and the Communists directly

3107.28 --> 3110.0
took it

3110.579 --> 3116.2400000000002
from the Devil Himself

3113.22 --> 3116.24
you could say

3119.04 --> 3121.7
it's biblical

3127.26 --> 3132.44
The Whistleblower issue my thoughts no

3135.18 --> 3141.98
I think they all signed

3137.94 --> 3144.839
signed on to not disclosing any

3141.98 --> 3148.14
indiscrepancies or anything that could

3144.839 --> 3150.42
shed a negative light

3148.14 --> 3153.72
on their activities

3150.42 --> 3156.559
when they engaged so nobody's gonna

3153.72 --> 3156.5589999999997
whistleblow it

3163.8 --> 3169.44
and the ones that do will just get

3166.2 --> 3172.2
ejected and just taken out of the

3169.44 --> 3174.96
attention completely

3172.2 --> 3178.9399999999996
I bet there are here and there or there

3174.96 --> 3178.94
have been some whistleblowers

3182.16 --> 3189.14
but I have no

3184.26 --> 3189.1400000000003
record of it right now okay look I'm not

3189.839 --> 3194.24
in the best of conditions to actually

3194.819 --> 3200.119
making really detailed arguments right

3197.94 --> 3200.119
now

3212.88 --> 3219.02
can you explain communism to you

3216.839 --> 3219.02
foreign

3219.059 --> 3223.8190000000004
really

3220.26 --> 3223.8190000000004
to do that all right now

3232.38 --> 3236.819
well what communism first and foremost

3234.839 --> 3242.16
is

3236.819 --> 3245.54
is atheist and amoral fundamentally

3242.16 --> 3245.54
that's where it starts

3247.68 --> 3253.14
and what it does is create

3250.94 --> 3255.0
Counter Culture

3253.14 --> 3257.339
to literally

3255.0 --> 3260.819
break

3257.339 --> 3264.48
break societies up

3260.819 --> 3266.46
and then scoop them up lock them in

3264.48 --> 3269.579
and literally

3266.46 --> 3271.7400000000002
eventually what they want it all to turn

3269.579 --> 3274.8590000000004
into is in

3271.74 --> 3276.9599999999996
slave labor situations where people have

3274.859 --> 3279.5
no other choice

3276.96 --> 3282.9
like as what's happening in China a lot

3279.5 --> 3285.9
standard procedure there right that's

3282.9 --> 3290.1800000000003
not an exception that is the inevitable

3285.9 --> 3290.1800000000003
end goal you understand

3293.88 --> 3298.98
and all the pretext all the liberalism

3297.599 --> 3303.2000000000003
and oh

3298.98 --> 3303.2
equal this equal that

3303.38 --> 3311.339
anti-discrimination everything it yields

3306.059 --> 3316.099
is every all anti-discrimination actions

3311.339 --> 3319.68
from within communist culture all create

3316.099 --> 3321.78
discrimination all of it it literally

3319.68 --> 3324.48
conjures it

3321.78 --> 3327.6600000000003
where before there would be none that's

3324.48 --> 3329.9
what it does that's what you do when you

3327.66 --> 3329.8999999999996
support

3330.02 --> 3333.38
lgbtqt whatever

3355.2 --> 3359.52
Orthodox Church yeah yeah well guess

3357.42 --> 3364.26
what the [ __ ] churches are in on it

3359.52 --> 3367.68
too don't you get it every [ __ ] time

3364.26 --> 3372.2990000000004
they're always in on it they always do

3367.68 --> 3375.359
that every [ __ ] Church does that

3372.299 --> 3377.04
yeah the Catholic Church did it with the

3375.359 --> 3379.44
Nazis

3377.04 --> 3385.099
there's always a [ __ ] church that

3379.44 --> 3385.099
will join the Empire they always do that

3385.2 --> 3389.7799999999997
it's just it's only about power

3390.359 --> 3392.839
all right

3400.38 --> 3407.52
but before they even get like an

3403.619 --> 3410.6400000000003
official Soviet control what they do is

3407.52 --> 3414.0
they derail societies

3410.64 --> 3416.2799999999997
through communist culture counterculture

3414.0 --> 3418.98
anti-culture

3416.28 --> 3421.1400000000003
then they bring in their politicians

3418.98 --> 3423.119
they spread the idea of socialism and

3421.14 --> 3425.8799999999997
then communism and then they do a

3423.119 --> 3429.119
hostile takeover

3425.88 --> 3433.04
and then they go towards the control

3429.119 --> 3433.04
freak Soviet model right

3433.319 --> 3439.799
so yeah once the Empire literally comes

3437.52 --> 3443.28
out of the closet and take full takes

3439.799 --> 3446.46
full grasp of something yeah that's when

3443.28 --> 3448.7000000000003
they basically kill off their peons

3446.46 --> 3451.38
their counterculture

3448.7 --> 3453.359
proponents that have helped them in in

3451.38 --> 3455.28
that position of power yeah they

3453.359 --> 3456.66
slaughter them

3455.28 --> 3458.579
yeah

3456.66 --> 3461.24
that's what they do

3458.579 --> 3461.2400000000002
idiot

3504.9 --> 3511.339
all gay people are no not all gay people

3507.48 --> 3514.079
are communists but that movement

3511.339 --> 3515.819
is distinctly

3514.079 --> 3518.3390000000004
communist

3515.819 --> 3519.9
funded sponsored

3518.339 --> 3522.359
all of it

3519.9 --> 3525.319
where's the money coming from what is

3522.359 --> 3525.319
being organized

3525.54 --> 3530.72
who's putting it in the attention

3528.299 --> 3530.72
yeah

3534.18 --> 3536.5989999999997
right

3537.96 --> 3543.48
so hey

3540.78 --> 3545.7000000000003
you're gay or you like gays or whatever

3543.48 --> 3547.92
you like that culture that's fine just

3545.7 --> 3550.22
know that if you're going to be part of

3547.92 --> 3550.2200000000003
some

3550.44 --> 3557.119
thing called lgbtq or whatever however

3554.339 --> 3557.119
that

3557.88 --> 3566.599
then you are entangling with the

3561.059 --> 3566.599
organization of it which is communist

3580.5 --> 3585.359
I never said that if you are gay that

3583.619 --> 3587.7000000000003
automatically means your communist

3585.359 --> 3590.94
that's a reification now I was

3587.7 --> 3592.9199999999996
specifically talking about

3590.94 --> 3594.78
your support

3592.92 --> 3596.64
to that movement

3594.78 --> 3598.559
which you obviously don't really

3596.64 --> 3601.16
understand what kind of a movement it is

3598.559 --> 3601.1600000000003
worldwide

3601.799 --> 3608.339
what they are always trying to achieve

3604.859 --> 3611.2799999999997
it's always getting a grasp

3608.339 --> 3615.96
of reaching in politics it's what

3611.28 --> 3618.8390000000004
happens every single time every country

3615.96 --> 3622.4
it manifests in every single country

3618.839 --> 3622.4
they always do this

3634.859 --> 3637.859
foreign

3654.92 --> 3661.64
yeah well it started with feminism

3658.2 --> 3661.64
it's the same process

3677.599 --> 3684.48
I mean what has feminism first and

3681.42 --> 3687.1800000000003
foremost achieved

3684.48 --> 3689.16
throughout its history in the last 100

3687.18 --> 3691.3799999999997
years

3689.16 --> 3693.66
yeah what is it achieved

3691.38 --> 3696.42
women getting less babies

3693.66 --> 3700.98
first and foremost in different forms

3696.42 --> 3704.88
yeah that's the first and foremost thing

3700.98 --> 3707.16
that it has been doing

3704.88 --> 3709.2000000000003
that's his influence

3707.16 --> 3712.859
you understand

3709.2 --> 3714.5989999999997
she made women equal to men

3712.859 --> 3716.7599999999998
and certainly they don't want to have

3714.599 --> 3718.5
babies anymore and they're discouraged

3716.76 --> 3722.78
to and

3718.5 --> 3722.78
too much much worse degrees

3722.819 --> 3727.94
but that's what it's turned into right

3749.76 --> 3755.0
I'll be back in two minutes

3752.819 --> 3755.0
foreign

3839.339 --> 3841.46
thank you

3842.22 --> 3844.3999999999996
foreign

3851.579 --> 3856.1600000000003
right so is anybody still left there in

3853.92 --> 3856.16
chat

3873.319 --> 3878.94
okay well here we go we can how would

3877.74 --> 3882.18
you know

3878.94 --> 3885.48
yeah the thing is about there's a

3882.18 --> 3888.0589999999997
physiological change that happens

3885.48 --> 3890.4
to women when they get a baby right so

3888.059 --> 3892.079
sometimes you say oh this woman is so

3890.4 --> 3893.94
terrible she would never have a baby

3892.079 --> 3896.2200000000003
well

3893.94 --> 3898.619
her getting that baby may actually

3896.22 --> 3900.48
change her for the better in a very

3898.619 --> 3903.079
serious way

3900.48 --> 3903.079
so

3904.92 --> 3909.98
I wouldn't hold on to that notion too

3907.74 --> 3909.9799999999996
much

3917.4 --> 3922.26
right and there will always be women

3920.28 --> 3925.02
with their whether there's feminist

3922.26 --> 3926.88
culture or not that just don't want to

3925.02 --> 3929.7599999999998
get kids

3926.88 --> 3931.6800000000003
for any reason

3929.76 --> 3935.1800000000003
there always have been there there

3931.68 --> 3935.18
always will be right

3945.119 --> 3950.1600000000003
is in a population

3946.88 --> 3952.02
crisis George Sanford

3950.16 --> 3955.02
think you're talking a little bit

3952.02 --> 3955.02
nonsense

3961.579 --> 3965.0
in what sense

3988.319 --> 3993.5389999999998
I think that

3991.2 --> 3997.0789999999997
the Earth is not in a population crisis

3993.539 --> 4000.6400000000003
I think Earth is in a Fairborn crisis

3997.079 --> 4000.6400000000003
that's what I think

4011.02 --> 4014.21
[Music]

4022.64 --> 4025.24
right

4071.599 --> 4075.1600000000003
okay well Lucinda

4075.2 --> 4078.799
that's very foolish of them if you ask

4078.02 --> 4081.98
me

4078.799 --> 4084.44
don't need men anymore hold them back

4081.98 --> 4087.92
well have you ever considered that women

4084.44 --> 4090.02
may be actually thrive on somebody

4087.92 --> 4092.2400000000002
holding them back

4090.02 --> 4094.0389999999998
I'm not leaning like put them in the

4092.24 --> 4096.139999999999
cage and they can't do or say anything

4094.039 --> 4097.400000000001
of course that's ridiculous

4096.14 --> 4100.46
but

4097.4 --> 4101.9
you really want one women to just

4100.46 --> 4103.179
go

4101.9 --> 4106.96
just

4103.179 --> 4106.96
unrestricted nonsense

4111.199 --> 4116.599999999999
like women getting together and this is

4114.08 --> 4118.699
like even half a century ago we didn't

4116.6 --> 4120.799
getting together can get pretty nutty

4118.699 --> 4122.419999999999
right and yeah of course you want some

4120.799 --> 4125.42
relief

4122.42 --> 4127.159
from the roll

4125.42 --> 4128.779
that is a signed

4127.159 --> 4130.46
you want some relief to that to get

4128.779 --> 4133.1
together with the girl she got you go

4130.46 --> 4135.44
crazy right

4133.1 --> 4137.299
not saying that you shouldn't be allowed

4135.44 --> 4140.12
to do that

4137.299 --> 4142.2789999999995
but to think like that should be the

4140.12 --> 4145.94
default and you don't need men anymore

4142.279 --> 4147.040000000001
and always be that's nuts

4145.94 --> 4150.8589999999995
that's crazy

4147.04 --> 4153.859
[Music]

4150.859 --> 4156.04
that's addict thinking that's what that

4153.859 --> 4156.04
is

4159.92 --> 4163.1
[Music]

4166.219 --> 4171.62
other men have to be looked after a bit

4169.159 --> 4173.719
like children yeah that's right

4171.62 --> 4178.5199999999995
and vice versa

4173.719 --> 4181.159
men need women women need men

4178.52 --> 4183.319
one way or the other that's how we were

4181.159 --> 4185.5
designed that's why there is such a

4183.319 --> 4185.5
thing

4230.5 --> 4235.96
holy [ __ ] the [ __ ] beep is grinding

4233.54 --> 4235.96
