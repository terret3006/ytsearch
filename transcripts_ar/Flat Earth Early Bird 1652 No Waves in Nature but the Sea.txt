fiber oats moxie

144.36 --> 150.42000000000002
it is Thursday the 6th of July 2023

152.099 --> 157.01999999999998
not gonna be having a super long show I

155.22 --> 158.879
don't know I was actually thinking of

157.02 --> 161.66
skipping the show because I just do not

158.879 --> 161.66
feel good really

163.26 --> 169.98
I didn't eat properly yesterday like I

166.5 --> 173.76
didn't even get proper lunch I

169.98 --> 173.76
was being foolish

174.78 --> 178.56
and now I'm kind of sickish because of

176.819 --> 181.44
that

178.56 --> 184.08
so I'm yeah I'm gonna make sure we'll

181.44 --> 188.66
try to make myself

184.08 --> 188.66000000000003
just eat properly after this

188.76 --> 195.739
just take my time because I just know I

191.28 --> 195.739
feel like yeah not great

196.5 --> 201.98
yeah

198.9 --> 201.98000000000002
sorry about that

202.98 --> 209.11999999999998
but when you eat less and I have been

205.98 --> 209.11999999999998
eating less for like

209.459 --> 216.18
for quite a while yeah then if you just

213.0 --> 217.26
take something unusual that you normally

216.18 --> 221.09900000000002
don't eat

217.26 --> 223.62
then that really makes an impact and I

221.099 --> 227.72
should have known better but now I know

223.62 --> 227.72
why experience again right

228.42 --> 232.92
it's not even like I tried a beer or

230.519 --> 234.42000000000002
something I haven't I haven't tried that

232.92 --> 236.76
at all

234.42 --> 240.42
now in this case it was

236.76 --> 243.44
even though organic it was um

240.42 --> 243.44
corn chips

245.94 --> 250.92
so like normally I'd eat a pizza or

249.12 --> 253.68
something this time I ate a bag of corn

250.92 --> 254.939
chips make made a little sauce salsa

253.68 --> 256.979
with that

254.939 --> 258.959
and it was really nice but I could

256.979 --> 262.88
already feel at the end of it like this

258.959 --> 262.88
is not gonna sit well on the long run

265.46 --> 269.53999999999996
so I'm not doing that anymore

272.699 --> 276.72

[Music]

291.0 --> 295.8
yeah I have very little to talk about

293.04 --> 298.28000000000003
right now because I just my focus is not

295.8 --> 298.28000000000003
super great

298.32 --> 301.82
but maybe it'll get better

309.6 --> 316.94

in a very grumpy mood and it was

333.24 --> 337.259
hilarious

335.639 --> 339.66
but apparently I'm not the only one

337.259 --> 341.639
having issues with like unauthorized.tv

339.66 --> 343.8
like I can't get in I'm still not sure

341.639 --> 345.38
whether it's my back that just blocked

343.8 --> 349.58
the payment

345.38 --> 349.58
or what's going on exactly

349.86 --> 355.16
but I'm just following it at the life

351.9 --> 355.15999999999997

[Music]

574.64 --> 578.24
knowing clammy

579.3 --> 582.0799999999999
good to see you

584.399 --> 590.72
check the temperature I think it's

586.74 --> 590.72
probably like back to 19 degrees

597.899 --> 602.82
yeah

599.58 --> 606.899
yep I was right it's 19 degrees

602.82 --> 609.86
well yesterday was really unusually cold

606.899 --> 609.86
15.

610.44 --> 617.36
according to the predictions it's still

612.66 --> 621.6
gonna get like 32 this Saturday so whoa

617.36 --> 621.6
28th Friday tomorrow

622.2 --> 628.339
Saturday is going to be extra hot wow so

625.019 --> 628.339
it's going to be a real swear

629.16 --> 631.8199999999999
huh

643.5 --> 646.76
hey more colored

651.66 --> 654.8389999999999
what

653.1 --> 658.0400000000001
are you talking

654.839 --> 658.0400000000001
oh good servant

662.7 --> 667.74
oh you didn't know that

665.16 --> 669.899
more colored oh

667.74 --> 673.26
yeah I don't have any licks to

669.899 --> 678.2
obituaries and and that kind of stuff

673.26 --> 678.2
I think a clutch might have that

686.04 --> 690.12
you did not know yeah that that's weird

688.32 --> 692.5400000000001
that you missed out on that

690.12 --> 692.54
mark

700.86 --> 704.24
hey Dan good to see you

718.44 --> 724.22
yeah no Mark I mean that was like half a

721.74 --> 724.22
year ago

727.079 --> 729.9799999999999
last year

734.339 --> 740.6400000000001
was it his demons well he had really

737.459 --> 744.1999999999999
serious stomach issues so he was kind of

740.64 --> 744.1999999999999
like not getting any better

744.6 --> 749.5790000000001
and what I suspect is that he had a

747.36 --> 752.7
fentanyl overdose because he did mention

749.579 --> 755.16
not too long before that happened

752.7 --> 757.339
that he was like getting that prescribed

755.16 --> 757.3389999999999
that

759.6 --> 763.279
so I think it's Fentanyl

770.399 --> 777.0
uh but I mean on the other hand he was

772.98 --> 779.5790000000001
actually physically suffering like a lot

777.0 --> 781.82
so it's one of those times that you're

779.579 --> 781.8199999999999
like

782.279 --> 787.079
this could be worse ways to go

785.339 --> 790.8800000000001
I mean

787.079 --> 790.88
at least he's not in agony anymore

791.12 --> 797.779
but yeah it is very sad he was a very

794.22 --> 797.779
very nice man

830.779 --> 838.62
yeah I totally get it Mark I mean yeah

835.62 --> 841.639
if you just found out yeah I was really

838.62 --> 841.639
bummed by it too

843.72 --> 849.019
then I done good service no I didn't ban

846.779 --> 849.019
him

855.779 --> 860.7
I had some issues with him though

858.42 --> 863.7199999999999
personal back and forth I got pissed off

860.7 --> 863.72
at him a few times

865.079 --> 870.2399999999999
and he was act there was a time when he

867.48 --> 872.4590000000001
was acting kind of weird but I mean he

870.24 --> 876.12
was paranoid

872.459 --> 878.54
in that time we got through that

876.12 --> 878.54
okay

884.94 --> 888.74
all right see you later skeptic

904.32 --> 907.94
yeah don't worry about it Mark

908.279 --> 910.88
thank you

909.24 --> 913.32
it's okay

910.88 --> 917.76
[Music]

913.32 --> 920.94
oh am I I'm I'm doing fine

917.76 --> 924.06
I'm doing pretty well actually but I'm

920.94 --> 925.9200000000001
right now this very moment I feel a

924.06 --> 927.959
little a little sickish a little wonky

925.92 --> 929.519
because I didn't really eat I eat ate

927.959 --> 931.5
something that I probably shouldn't have

929.519 --> 934.32
yesterday

931.5 --> 936.899
and and I barely ate anything else like

934.32 --> 939.899
besides the corn chips I ate a banana

936.899 --> 943.38
and an apple and that like that was it

939.899 --> 946.339
that's the total sum of it

943.38 --> 946.3389999999999
which is crazy

951.12 --> 958.399
like it's weird man I got I got I I got

955.44 --> 958.399
an eating issue

959.399 --> 964.8
I think that the world might be like

961.92 --> 967.68
over exciting me and stressing me out in

964.8 --> 971.12
ways that I literally

967.68 --> 971.12
trouble eating because of it

974.82 --> 981.5400000000001
because for me it let me tell you that

978.42 --> 984.06
it is a kind of serious but it's not

981.54 --> 986.459
like oh my God I need some psychological

984.06 --> 987.1199999999999
counseling I'll do that myself but I

986.459 --> 989.0999999999999
mean

987.12 --> 991.44
what is happening

989.1 --> 993.1800000000001
is that I'm like going to this grocery

991.44 --> 995.639
store and I'm like yeah all this and

993.18 --> 997.38
that and then I buy it then I get home

995.639 --> 1000.32
and it's like

997.38 --> 1003.62
but I'm not hungry like

1000.32 --> 1005.6600000000001
I love the idea of eating it but then

1003.62 --> 1007.9590000000001
when it comes to actually eating it it's

1005.66 --> 1007.959
like

1008.18 --> 1013.16
it's just unexpected

1011.12 --> 1016.22
you'll turn

1013.16 --> 1017.54
from inside and this keeps happening I

1016.22 --> 1020.899
mean it's been

1017.54 --> 1023.12
maybe it's a side effect of like eating

1020.899 --> 1025.4
less in general because it has kind of

1023.12 --> 1027.02
been happening since then it's like when

1025.4 --> 1029.0590000000002
I have to like oh [ __ ] I don't have

1027.02 --> 1032.0
enough money I have to eat less

1029.059 --> 1034.22
there's nothing nobody can help then I

1032.0 --> 1036.079
start to like

1034.22 --> 1037.939
I don't know cling

1036.079 --> 1039.86
clink down

1037.939 --> 1042.799
my stomach becomes smaller or something

1039.86 --> 1045.74
and it works but then when it's supposed

1042.799 --> 1050.26
to be over

1045.74 --> 1050.26
it doesn't like re-expand

1050.419 --> 1057.26
that seems to be my problem

1054.14 --> 1060.16
it's like I'm kind of stuck

1057.26 --> 1060.16
to this

1061.0 --> 1065.72
poverty mode

1063.02 --> 1068.44
concerning food I don't know what it is

1065.72 --> 1068.44
it's not good

1081.74 --> 1087.02
what they provide in the store

1084.26 --> 1088.8799999999999
well do I have no

1087.02 --> 1091.4189999999999
no what they provide in the store is

1088.88 --> 1091.419
just fine

1091.7 --> 1099.02
I mean I guess theoretically it could be

1094.64 --> 1101.539
better with things but

1099.02 --> 1103.1
no that's not the problem

1101.539 --> 1105.26
the problem is not the quality of the

1103.1 --> 1107.78
food the problem is that I just don't

1105.26 --> 1109.64
want to eat and it's really weird it's

1107.78 --> 1110.84
like I come home I feel like I need to

1109.64 --> 1112.8200000000002
eat now

1110.84 --> 1115.1
but I don't wanna

1112.82 --> 1118.34
and I'm like kind of puzzled by it

1115.1 --> 1120.62
myself and I try to like okay maybe in a

1118.34 --> 1124.34
few minutes I want to eat

1120.62 --> 1126.9799999999998
and it just keeps not happening

1124.34 --> 1129.1999999999998
I don't know man

1126.98 --> 1132.08
but I do really think that maybe just

1129.2 --> 1135.26
like this stressful situation and I mean

1132.08 --> 1139.12
the things are going extra crazy now

1135.26 --> 1139.12
it's accelerating and

1141.44 --> 1146.539
I mean I really called it with this

1144.2 --> 1148.1000000000001
Armageddon [ __ ]

1146.539 --> 1150.98
people out there calling it The

1148.1 --> 1152.4189999999999
Apocalypse still not getting it only the

1150.98 --> 1153.679
thing the apocalypse is a great

1152.419 --> 1155.539
revealing

1153.679 --> 1158.48
that's where you get to figure it out

1155.539 --> 1159.44
and get to and are forced to choose a

1158.48 --> 1162.26
sign

1159.44 --> 1166.48
that's the apocalypse so the Armageddon

1162.26 --> 1166.48
is everything going at each other

1169.16 --> 1174.6200000000001
like Wars that's Armageddon that's where

1172.58 --> 1177.039
it starts and I feel like that's

1174.62 --> 1177.039
happening

1179.419 --> 1186.6200000000001
feel like some serious War might just

1183.44 --> 1189.919
break out any moment like across I think

1186.62 --> 1192.7399999999998
World War III might just about to

1189.919 --> 1196.0
unload

1192.74 --> 1196.0
like the first stage

1199.46 --> 1203.98
since 5G came out you've lost your

1201.559 --> 1203.98
appetite

1211.64 --> 1217.4
I can imagine at the Nordstrom I mean

1214.24 --> 1219.679
there's no 5G Towers installed around

1217.4 --> 1222.4
here as far as I know I think that they

1219.679 --> 1222.4
specifically

1223.16 --> 1230.559
bypass that here

1226.22 --> 1230.559
at the urgence of a lot of people

1232.76 --> 1238.28
but I I yeah I mean

1235.94 --> 1239.78
it's true if I go to like a forest

1238.28 --> 1241.34
that's like really away from

1239.78 --> 1243.74
civilization

1241.34 --> 1246.58
I get a lot hungrier

1243.74 --> 1246.58
it's true

1249.799 --> 1255.26
most Towers yeah not over here they

1252.08 --> 1258.26
don't do that more color not here

1255.26 --> 1260.72
I mean in the United States and England

1258.26 --> 1264.5
they might do that they don't well here

1260.72 --> 1267.74
there is one place where they do that

1264.5 --> 1270.5
where they did that

1267.74 --> 1273.86
I've even spotted that thing

1270.5 --> 1276.02
like by the road more to the South here

1273.86 --> 1279.1399999999999
in the Netherlands

1276.02 --> 1282.26
but I mean it's

1279.14 --> 1285.44
it's not everywhere

1282.26 --> 1290.299
it's not 5G if it was 5G then it would

1285.44 --> 1294.559
be literally everywhere you would always

1290.299 --> 1295.76
see in your line of sight more than two

1294.559 --> 1298.34
towers

1295.76 --> 1300.799
every time otherwise there's no point

1298.34 --> 1303.6399999999999
for 5G if it's not the tower everywhere

1300.799 --> 1303.6399999999999
there's no point

1305.36 --> 1309.039
because it's such a short range

1314.96 --> 1318.74
right so I'm very lucky that there's

1316.82 --> 1322.22
that that's not here and that we

1318.74 --> 1325.58
absolutely don't need it ever

1322.22 --> 1327.5
and then all these Mobiles on 4G are

1325.58 --> 1330.32
working just great and they're all

1327.5 --> 1331.46
internet downloading stuff perfectly

1330.32 --> 1335.24
smooth

1331.46 --> 1338.6000000000001
and very fast and we absolutely don't

1335.24 --> 1341.14
need anything more than that

1338.6 --> 1341.1399999999999
fact

1353.78 --> 1356.02
foreign

1365.02 --> 1368.98
Dutch are you

1370.1 --> 1373.1789999999999
what are you talking about

1381.52 --> 1387.3799999999999
highways covered with 5G okay

1385.34 --> 1390.039
that could be

1387.38 --> 1390.0390000000002
I guess

1406.41 --> 1409.64
[Music]

1422.659 --> 1428.44
oh sure sure yeah it could be in the

1426.26 --> 1428.44
lights

1430.9 --> 1439.299
but I mean yeah the highway it's

1435.38 --> 1439.2990000000002
yeah it is what it is

1444.44 --> 1449.179
right it's not really my issue anyway

1446.84 --> 1451.4599999999998
like even when I had a car it's not like

1449.179 --> 1454.24
I continually Drive

1451.46 --> 1454.24
on the highway

1471.2 --> 1473.799
hmm

1476.6 --> 1482.74
okay Mark dude well go and drink

1479.96 --> 1482.74
something then

1483.559 --> 1486.82
if you're dehydrated

1487.52 --> 1490.52
oh

1489.14 --> 1494.38
[Music]

1490.52 --> 1494.3799999999999
I mean don't you have any running water

1506.72 --> 1509.38
foreign

1509.78 --> 1512.5
all right

1519.86 --> 1525.62
let's see where you live are good in you

1523.34 --> 1528.1999999999998
yeah there's like knowingly there's a

1525.62 --> 1530.8999999999999
few cities that were gonna be like smart

1528.2 --> 1534.5800000000002
cities supposedly

1530.9 --> 1534.5800000000002
and that's appledorn

1537.14 --> 1542.96
which is like a city to the east

1539.96 --> 1545.179
it's not really remarkable and I think

1542.96 --> 1548.24
that they want to do like

1545.179 --> 1550.5800000000002
they're like the the flunkies are

1548.24 --> 1554.86
pushing that a lot for like another city

1550.58 --> 1554.86
I think was called tilburg

1554.9 --> 1560.0
that so they're trying that so they're

1558.08 --> 1562.34
trying to pick out these cities and then

1560.0 --> 1563.779
basically like weaponize them that is

1562.34 --> 1566.12
effectively what it is when they're

1563.779 --> 1568.34
talking about smart cities that means

1566.12 --> 1570.5
weaponized that means they're trying to

1568.34 --> 1572.8999999999999
turn it into a slave colony

1570.5 --> 1575.419
quite literally

1572.9 --> 1578.5590000000002
and the people that live in such City

1575.419 --> 1582.8200000000002
when they find out they shoot like

1578.559 --> 1582.82
savagely protest against it

1586.22 --> 1593.74
or leave or leave the city because I

1589.94 --> 1593.74
mean it's not gonna be livable

1594.559 --> 1600.32
they are gonna turn those things into

1597.22 --> 1602.419
15-minute cities that it's not going to

1600.32 --> 1605.779
be livable

1602.419 --> 1608.0590000000002
quite literally

1605.779 --> 1610.64
so if you live there and you thought you

1608.059 --> 1614.98
could have a business there well forget

1610.64 --> 1614.98
about it you better move to another city

1625.64 --> 1633.0800000000002
right or you get these crazy

1629.62 --> 1636.1999999999998
environmentalist fascists

1633.08 --> 1637.1589999999999
WF flunkies out of there you kick them

1636.2 --> 1638.659
up

1637.159 --> 1640.7
or you

1638.659 --> 1642.14
or literally drive them out of their

1640.7 --> 1644.299
houses I mean

1642.14 --> 1646.7
why would you have to like oh we're

1644.299 --> 1651.6399999999999
gonna occupy the dude just go to their

1646.7 --> 1651.64
houses get them out get those people out

1654.74 --> 1661.0
it's like hey

1657.5 --> 1661.0
you're an invader

1661.039 --> 1664.6589999999999
your anti-dutch

1665.2 --> 1671.72
you're a sellout to Mega corporations

1668.419 --> 1676.0
that want to enslave us and exploit us

1671.72 --> 1676.0
now get the [ __ ] out of our town

1708.62 --> 1713.2399999999998
what the [ __ ] does that have to do with

1711.08 --> 1715.8799999999999
it clammy no

1713.24 --> 1719.419
it definitely is something I ate

1715.88 --> 1722.7990000000002
yesterday yeah I found out by the GTI

1719.419 --> 1722.7990000000002
like four days ago

1726.32 --> 1732.74
now I'm not particularly happy about it

1729.74 --> 1735.08
that it takes freaking two years

1732.74 --> 1738.039
and that literally nobody is like

1735.08 --> 1738.039
helping me out here

1739.94 --> 1747.14
right that yo you look let's just talk

1743.539 --> 1748.7
about let's just ask questions about it

1747.14 --> 1751.159
and then I have to deal with stupid

1748.7 --> 1753.14
trolls saying it's a scam and [ __ ] and

1751.159 --> 1755.2990000000002
have to kick them out again

1753.14 --> 1757.64
well nobody provides extra evidence of

1755.299 --> 1759.1399999999999
how it is a scam what exactly is the

1757.64 --> 1761.48
scam

1759.14 --> 1763.279
because they don't know and there's no

1761.48 --> 1764.1200000000001
website out there that can actually tell

1763.279 --> 1767.799
you

1764.12 --> 1767.799
because it isn't a scam

1769.58 --> 1775.539
but nobody's helping me out

1771.86 --> 1775.539
like I'm still stuck there

1777.62 --> 1782.12
right but I mean yeah it's gonna take

1779.6 --> 1785.12
two freaking years which is like it is

1782.12 --> 1787.399
too long it is way too long like

1785.12 --> 1789.86
what the [ __ ] am I supposed to do with

1787.399 --> 1792.3799999999999
like oh double your money in two years

1789.86 --> 1793.8799999999999
in [ __ ] two years there isn't gonna

1792.38 --> 1797.38
be anything

1793.88 --> 1797.38
it's pointless

1807.2 --> 1812.3600000000001
I mean by the way things are going I

1810.86 --> 1814.34
mean there's a good chance that by the

1812.36 --> 1816.74
time I could get money out of it it

1814.34 --> 1819.5
literally is like Civilization is

1816.74 --> 1821.8990000000001
completely disintegrated

1819.5 --> 1825.26
there's a good chance of that and I'm

1821.899 --> 1827.62
realizing that it's very typical in my

1825.26 --> 1827.62
opinion

1836.96 --> 1840.94
but who knows maybe it'll survive

1844.159 --> 1850.22
or things will go all to hell and like

1847.46 --> 1852.32
if Dubai certainly gets bombed and like

1850.22 --> 1855.799
entire Dubai gets destroyed well that's

1852.32 --> 1858.799
goodbye to GTI too and by the way like

1855.799 --> 1861.679
three quarters of all Financial things

1858.799 --> 1865.279
that people run because it's all in

1861.679 --> 1868.1000000000001
Dubai yeah if if that blows up

1865.279 --> 1872.659
like everything's gone it's like almost

1868.1 --> 1875.9189999999999
all crypto things will be gone

1872.659 --> 1875.919
you understand that

1877.52 --> 1884.24
right so yeah if they really want to

1881.24 --> 1887.419
force that CBC [ __ ] through

1884.24 --> 1889.22
very simple you blow up Dubai

1887.419 --> 1891.74
that's not simple because that's not

1889.22 --> 1893.8990000000001
gonna just happen without any backlash

1891.74 --> 1896.659
but I mean

1893.899 --> 1899.84
it's globalists

1896.659 --> 1902.8600000000001
do you want a force CBC to through then

1899.84 --> 1902.86
blow up Dubai

1904.76 --> 1911.559
because like three quarters of all World

1907.52 --> 1911.559
crypto [ __ ] is is there

1914.539 --> 1919.1
anyway

1916.76 --> 1920.539
let's not give them any suggestions hope

1919.1 --> 1922.8799999999999
too late

1920.539 --> 1924.62
I don't care

1922.88 --> 1927.2
I mean

1924.62 --> 1930.62
you could just like oh maybe hold on top

1927.2 --> 1933.74
I'm just [ __ ] sick of saying let's

1930.62 --> 1935.7199999999998
just hope they don't do this I don't

1933.74 --> 1938.6
want to be in the [ __ ] position that

1935.72 --> 1939.98
to say let's hope they don't do this

1938.6 --> 1942.86
terrible thing

1939.98 --> 1945.38
why don't we [ __ ] just finish them

1942.86 --> 1948.5
off so that we don't have to worry about

1945.38 --> 1950.0
oh let's hope they don't do this well

1948.5 --> 1953.36
why don't they

1950.0 --> 1954.62
just start hoping we don't do something

1953.36 --> 1956.779
to them

1954.62 --> 1958.899
why don't we actually do something to

1956.779 --> 1958.899
them

1959.0 --> 1964.039
so that they can hope

1961.58 --> 1967.279
that something doesn't happen to them

1964.039 --> 1969.799
again why do we have to continually hope

1967.279 --> 1972.62
that they don't do something to us I

1969.799 --> 1974.799
mean this is a ridiculous position to be

1972.62 --> 1974.799
in

1981.08 --> 1986.559
we have not enough are you kidding me

1983.72 --> 1986.559
Supreme knowing

1989.84 --> 1996.9189999999999
really not enough people yeah it is very

1994.399 --> 1998.84
much like half of the world at this

1996.919 --> 2000.76
point

1998.84 --> 2002.32
the problem is is they're not organized

2000.76 --> 2005.2
they're not

2002.32 --> 2008.4399999999998
in full realization yeah it's a full-on

2005.2 --> 2011.94
worldwide Civil War

2008.44 --> 2011.94
like you too

2013.0 --> 2019.32
but I mean they are on our side they

2015.94 --> 2019.3200000000002
just don't really know what to do

2040.24 --> 2048.76
right but I am so so incredibly [ __ ]

2044.98 --> 2051.28
done with this [ __ ] guessing game of

2048.76 --> 2053.619
what they're gonna do to us I don't want

2051.28 --> 2056.139
to play the [ __ ] game anymore why

2053.619 --> 2058.599
don't we play a [ __ ] game guess

2056.139 --> 2060.46
what's gonna happen to them why don't we

2058.599 --> 2064.3790000000004
play that game

2060.46 --> 2064.379
why don't we play that game instead

2073.29 --> 2082.639
[Music]

2128.859 --> 2133.66
activist

2131.26 --> 2136.32
is that a summary enough for you as to

2133.66 --> 2136.3199999999997
who is them

2138.339 --> 2144.94
yeah and us is well everybody else

2143.56 --> 2147.22
but

2144.94 --> 2150.2200000000003
from my person mostly the people that

2147.22 --> 2153.2799999999997
actually are the nationalists that

2150.22 --> 2155.14
when left

2153.28 --> 2157.0600000000004
to their devices will eventually

2155.14 --> 2159.52
strengthen the nation in the National

2157.06 --> 2163.9
spirit so it is it is like the

2159.52 --> 2163.9
Nationalist against the anti-humans

2166.96 --> 2171.06
that's that's how this works

2171.76 --> 2177.5400000000004
now we're not talking about flat

2173.56 --> 2177.54
earthers and Ballers right now

2177.82 --> 2183.4
I mean this it's of minor consequence

2180.4 --> 2185.26
yeah Ballers are not like

2183.4 --> 2187.78
trying to build

2185.26 --> 2190.9
Flat Earth cities that they can trap us

2187.78 --> 2193.599
in yeah that's not happening like

2190.9 --> 2196.2400000000002
everything Flat Earth ball or stuff is

2193.599 --> 2198.339
all internet nonsense it's all on the

2196.24 --> 2202.0
Internet it's all just social media yeah

2198.339 --> 2206.94
there is no actual Civil War there's no

2202.0 --> 2206.94
group of Ballers that are specifically

2207.52 --> 2210.18
like

2211.06 --> 2216.2799999999997
yeah trying to put us in prison camps or

2213.52 --> 2217.9
something okay is it yeah it's not

2216.28 --> 2221.7400000000002
relevant

2217.9 --> 2223.9
it's more relevant the General Public

2221.74 --> 2228.0
that's getting assaulted by people in

2223.9 --> 2228.0
the government and mega corporations

2233.76 --> 2243.2400000000002
no clammy I don't work on that list

2238.72 --> 2243.24
why do you think that I would do that

2244.839 --> 2249.7
like I'd barely even know what's

2247.9 --> 2251.98
happening in the Netherlands

2249.7 --> 2255.64
I know the rough outlines but there are

2251.98 --> 2257.8
not my specialism isn't freaking what's

2255.64 --> 2259.72
happening in the Netherlands

2257.8 --> 2263.5600000000004
I'm trying to keep track a little bit

2259.72 --> 2265.66
more than I have in the past

2263.56 --> 2268.119
but I mean I

2265.66 --> 2270.52
yeah I know some figures

2268.119 --> 2272.92
because of exposure through alternative

2270.52 --> 2275.5
media

2272.92 --> 2277.54
but uh yeah it's not a very elaborate

2275.5 --> 2280.92
list but there's a whole bunch of people

2277.54 --> 2280.92
here in the Netherlands like that

2281.02 --> 2287.56
but I mean people are on to it

2284.74 --> 2290.68
the Dutch people are onto it like these

2287.56 --> 2293.0789999999997
people have been very much identified

2290.68 --> 2294.7
they are being

2293.079 --> 2296.8590000000004
like

2294.7 --> 2299.6189999999997
boycotted

2296.859 --> 2302.339
so that they basically can't keep doing

2299.619 --> 2302.339
what they do

2307.06 --> 2311.38
so yeah I still have some hope for the

2309.82 --> 2313.6600000000003
Netherlands in that sense but I mean

2311.38 --> 2315.88
it's all still like they're still just

2313.66 --> 2317.3799999999997
like periodically like throwing away

2315.88 --> 2319.839
billions

2317.38 --> 2322.32
to like useless [ __ ] like the war in

2319.839 --> 2322.32
Ukraine

2324.16 --> 2330.48
or like giving it away to some other

2326.74 --> 2330.4799999999996
country or something it's crazy

2346.42 --> 2352.119
yeah it is a bit of a Fed post from

2349.0 --> 2354.839
clammy indeed iron 26 Goods I was

2352.119 --> 2354.839
thinking that too

2358.54 --> 2364.3
yeah yeah but that's the thing right I'm

2361.78 --> 2366.48
not gonna start naming names I didn't do

2364.3 --> 2366.48
that

2371.38 --> 2377.76
so yeah clammy

2374.26 --> 2377.76
why did you ask that

2378.28 --> 2381.96
I have a good explanation

2385.96 --> 2392.94
like for saying that

2388.5 --> 2392.94
besides all your enthusiasm here

2401.8 --> 2408.3390000000004
so do not do so dude if I'd make a list

2405.099 --> 2411.2200000000003
then nobody was gonna I'm not gonna tell

2408.339 --> 2412.96
anybody about it yeah

2411.22 --> 2414.3999999999996
so I'm gonna have a list I'm just gonna

2412.96 --> 2416.7400000000002
have a list

2414.4 --> 2420.06
the internet's not gonna know that I

2416.74 --> 2420.06
have a list or who's on it

2422.079 --> 2425.28
but I don't have a list

2425.859 --> 2429.64
and if I did have a list I wouldn't tell

2428.44 --> 2432.339
you

2429.64 --> 2434.8199999999997
so you're simply not gonna find out if I

2432.339 --> 2434.82
have a list

2435.04 --> 2439.72
you're talking about this and that oh or

2437.5 --> 2442.18
what you've never been you've never

2439.72 --> 2443.7999999999997
actually seen one of those shows of mine

2442.18 --> 2448.0789999999997
where I'm like what you think that

2443.8 --> 2448.079
that's the default reality now glammy

2448.48 --> 2453.2400000000002
have you actually watched my shows over

2450.88 --> 2453.2400000000002
the years

2467.38 --> 2475.119
yeah and I'm basically talking about

2471.42 --> 2478.119
procedures actions that can be done by

2475.119 --> 2480.94
General people to other General Target

2478.119 --> 2483.4
groups yeah that's what I've been

2480.94 --> 2486.4
talking about very harshly

2483.4 --> 2489.54
like as in a civil war settings which

2486.4 --> 2489.54
which is what it is

2491.26 --> 2497.079
yeah I'm not going to make a list I'm

2493.9 --> 2500.56
not going to be a [ __ ] [ __ ] and

2497.079 --> 2504.82
post-criminal activities yeah you

2500.56 --> 2507.099
[ __ ] want to get me arrested dick

2504.82 --> 2509.2000000000003
now why'd you stop asking those stupid

2507.099 --> 2511.119
fed questions yeah

2509.2 --> 2515.339
and don't bite for that you think I

2511.119 --> 2515.339
don't know how that works

2519.19 --> 2529.2400000000002
[Music]

2525.64 --> 2531.7599999999998
yeah I'm not some Facebook [ __ ] that's

2529.24 --> 2534.4599999999996
gonna brag about how we how he shoots

2531.76 --> 2536.32
people or something

2534.46 --> 2538.66
and then post it publicly on Facebook

2536.32 --> 2541.619
yeah I'm not one of those [ __ ]

2538.66 --> 2541.6189999999997
retards yeah

2545.26 --> 2547.9
yeah

2545.64 --> 2550.9
[Music]

2547.9 --> 2550.9
foreign

2551.4 --> 2556.06
anger I roll out insights that's what I

2555.16 --> 2559.18
do

2556.06 --> 2562.96
what is effective hey clammy

2559.18 --> 2565.5
stop stop playing such an ignoramus

2562.96 --> 2565.5
okay

2569.5 --> 2574.48
I'm on your site well then don't ask

2571.599 --> 2576.82
questions about list of executions you

2574.48 --> 2579.78
idiot

2576.82 --> 2579.78
don't you know anything

2584.92 --> 2589.06
like what the [ __ ] what you want that

2587.14 --> 2589.96
why don't you make that [ __ ] list

2589.06 --> 2592.54
then

2589.96 --> 2594.76
if that's so urgent to you that's so

2592.54 --> 2596.68
normal to talk about to you yeah you

2594.76 --> 2598.5400000000004
make the [ __ ] list you go make a

2596.68 --> 2601.44
video about it you go see what happens

2598.54 --> 2601.44
yeah

2644.859 --> 2651.0
change of subject is it there's no

2647.92 --> 2651.0
subject of the day

2663.16 --> 2669.0989999999997
right so yeah clammy look when I talk

2666.04 --> 2671.339
about that [ __ ] about Revolution

2669.099 --> 2674.1400000000003
let me be

2671.339 --> 2677.56
excessively clear

2674.14 --> 2681.819
I'm not talking about I am gonna go

2677.56 --> 2684.4
militant yeah me Arwin I am [ __ ] not

2681.819 --> 2686.98
gonna do that I will be yelling and

2684.4 --> 2690.94
being really loud and maybe obnoxious

2686.98 --> 2694.48
and excessive and very very aggressive

2690.94 --> 2698.14
talking about it I'm not actually gonna

2694.48 --> 2702.94
do it I'm not [ __ ] capable of doing

2698.14 --> 2707.68
that I'd literally hit the ground

2702.94 --> 2713.52
sick before I get to actually doing any

2707.68 --> 2713.52
of it from acute stress and Terror

2715.9 --> 2720.88
yeah

2718.3 --> 2724.0600000000004
but I'm glad there's people out there

2720.88 --> 2726.04
that don't have that issue like I do

2724.06 --> 2727.72
that aren't like that don't have a weak

2726.04 --> 2729.16
stomach basically that's what it comes

2727.72 --> 2731.7599999999998
down to

2729.16 --> 2731.7599999999998
okay

2733.0 --> 2742.42
I'm a blabber mouth I'm not a soldier

2739.06 --> 2745.24
I talk I'm really good at talking I'm

2742.42 --> 2747.359
not very good at bashing people's heads

2745.24 --> 2747.359
in

2750.88 --> 2757.359
I mean yeah I could do it out of acute

2753.579 --> 2759.4
self-defense like with extreme fear I

2757.359 --> 2761.92
could do that like strike like a wild

2759.4 --> 2763.96
band and I could probably do it pretty

2761.92 --> 2765.76
well too

2763.96 --> 2769.66
like yeah in self-defense I could

2765.76 --> 2772.78
definitely kill somebody in self-defense

2769.66 --> 2776.3799999999997
but that doesn't work

2772.78 --> 2778.599
when I go out and do something about the

2776.38 --> 2782.98
world it doesn't work

2778.599 --> 2785.02
for me I can't do that now a trained

2782.98 --> 2788.02
soldier

2785.02 --> 2790.3
or like an ex-soldier or maybe a really

2788.02 --> 2792.94
hardcore policeman they could do that

2790.3 --> 2797.26
because they have the training to do

2792.94 --> 2798.7000000000003
that I don't

2797.26 --> 2801.94
yeah

2798.7 --> 2805.48
is that clear I will be nothing other

2801.94 --> 2806.98
than a very loud ass blabber mouth on

2805.48 --> 2810.819
the internet

2806.98 --> 2813.94
you're not gonna see me Wheeling a gun

2810.819 --> 2815.56
in the streets yeah that's never gonna

2813.94 --> 2818.38
happen

2815.56 --> 2820.9
or well if it's gonna happen then it is

2818.38 --> 2823.54
full on Revolution and I will not be one

2820.9 --> 2825.28
of the first to do it then

2823.54 --> 2827.8
right I mean if there's gonna be an

2825.28 --> 2830.46
actual civil war with like Dutch people

2827.8 --> 2833.5
actually like okay now it's actually War

2830.46 --> 2834.7
then I might like go to them and ask

2833.5 --> 2837.64
like hey

2834.7 --> 2839.4399999999996
you need me or you need me to say

2837.64 --> 2842.56
certain things on my show I'll probably

2839.44 --> 2845.8
do that like what can I do to support

2842.56 --> 2847.96
you like on my social media

2845.8 --> 2849.7000000000003
and they might tell me like yeah [ __ ]

2847.96 --> 2852.16
your social media it's a [ __ ] waste

2849.7 --> 2854.74
of time you're a loser and then I'd be

2852.16 --> 2856.0
like okay fair enough what what can I do

2854.74 --> 2859.1189999999997
then

2856.0 --> 2862.0
yeah that's realistic

2859.119 --> 2864.579
so don't [ __ ] imagine like I'm some

2862.0 --> 2867.579
kind of a secret Rambo or something it's

2864.579 --> 2872.04
[ __ ] pointless

2867.579 --> 2872.04
I am not a secret Rambo

2874.3 --> 2882.819
yeah I I don't even like fighting

2878.98 --> 2885.94
I used to do Taekwondo got decent edit

2882.819 --> 2888.64
you know what part I wasn't good at

2885.94 --> 2892.599
the actual fighting

2888.64 --> 2896.14
I hate it you know why I hate it

2892.599 --> 2900.28
because with every [ __ ] punch ideal

2896.14 --> 2904.96
I automatically feel the pain

2900.28 --> 2908.8
of who I'm hitting it sucks

2904.96 --> 2912.339
fighting sucks when you're an empath

2908.8 --> 2914.8590000000004
unless you're unbelievably [ __ ] livid

2912.339 --> 2917.0789999999997
angry because then you get extra energy

2914.859 --> 2921.359
and you don't care that you feel that

2917.079 --> 2921.3590000000004
[ __ ] and then it's all outward

2921.579 --> 2927.3390000000004
but that's

2923.2 --> 2930.16
only reserved for people that piss you

2927.339 --> 2932.02
off on purpose to an extreme level and

2930.16 --> 2936.16
that doesn't happen

2932.02 --> 2938.7599999999998
in a civil war situation that's [ __ ]

2936.16 --> 2938.7599999999998
yeah

2938.8 --> 2946.02
so please stop trying to imagine like

2941.44 --> 2946.02
I'm some kind of a Rambo figure I'm not

2952.359 --> 2956.7999999999997
and it goes both ways I need to stop

2954.88 --> 2959.5
imagining that too because when I get

2956.8 --> 2961.42
really livid I imagine that I am like

2959.5 --> 2965.8
that

2961.42 --> 2967.119
fits very nicely alongside like extreme

2965.8 --> 2968.9300000000003
anger

2967.119 --> 2970.3
but it's not realistic

2968.93 --> 2972.339
[Music]

2970.3 --> 2975.9
oh I need some new clothes yeah well

2972.339 --> 2975.9
donate to my PayPal then

2982.48 --> 2986.619
do you think I need some new clothes

2984.22 --> 2989.3799999999997
yeah donate to my PayPal I do need some

2986.619 --> 2991.8
new clothes that's right I need a lot of

2989.38 --> 2991.8
new things

3003.9 --> 3006.5
foreign

3009.619 --> 3014.599
get the [ __ ] out of here then piece of

3012.359 --> 3014.5989999999997
[ __ ]

3023.64 --> 3031.7999999999997
okay yeah yeah

3027.56 --> 3033.7799999999997
by now it's the same [ __ ] Wit again so

3031.8 --> 3036.96
I'm turning off my phone because he

3033.78 --> 3039.2400000000002
really likes to send me stupid ass calls

3036.96 --> 3041.88
in the middle of my show

3039.24 --> 3043.5
it's the same piece of [ __ ] it likes

3041.88 --> 3045.3
doing that

3043.5 --> 3047.66
so yeah you're not gonna do that today

3045.3 --> 3047.6600000000003
though

3062.04 --> 3067.7
what's the talk no I don't know talking

3065.16 --> 3067.7
about whatever

3067.74 --> 3072.18
I'm kind of like slapping clammy here

3070.26 --> 3076.4
because he basically asked oh where's

3072.18 --> 3076.3999999999996
your kill list like what the [ __ ]

3077.579 --> 3081.3590000000004
maybe clammy is really young or

3079.98 --> 3084.2400000000002
something

3081.359 --> 3085.859
maybe doesn't get it that that's not

3084.24 --> 3088.64
really the way you're supposed to

3085.859 --> 3088.64
address somebody

3092.46 --> 3095.96
[ __ ] yourselves come back

3096.059 --> 3101.3
you know that nobody's ever gonna see

3098.28 --> 3101.3
what you're saying right

3116.3 --> 3123.1600000000003
it's refraction always present how can a

3121.079 --> 3126.28
physical Horizon be measured it can

3123.16 --> 3126.2799999999997
[Music]

3126.78 --> 3132.6600000000003
there is no physical Horizon The Horizon

3129.42 --> 3135.599
is an optical effect

3132.66 --> 3138.96
it isn't physical it's not geometric if

3135.599 --> 3142.52
it was geometric if it was physical

3138.96 --> 3145.14
then there would be distinct geometric

3142.52 --> 3147.48
consequences that would have to be

3145.14 --> 3149.52
present at all time

3147.48 --> 3152.22
but they aren't

3149.52 --> 3155.839
Black Swan

3152.22 --> 3155.839
The Horizon isn't physical

3165.619 --> 3170.78
thanks for the Flat Earth question it's

3168.18 --> 3170.7799999999997
been a while

3175.26 --> 3179.94
um

3176.819 --> 3182.04
who are you talking to oh right oh yeah

3179.94 --> 3185.64
iron yeah thanks for becoming a member

3182.04 --> 3187.8
man I forgot that that's possible

3185.64 --> 3190.14
but yeah on this on my main Channel I do

3187.8 --> 3192.2400000000002
have a membership

3190.14 --> 3194.339
then everybody that was a member was

3192.24 --> 3196.02
kind of like a membership because

3194.339 --> 3198.2
they've been not streaming on this

3196.02 --> 3201.72
channel for three months

3198.2 --> 3204.02
so you're the first new member iron 26

3201.72 --> 3204.02
thanks

3218.339 --> 3224.5789999999997
right well I think that the

3222.42 --> 3227.099
from the way things are rolling out now

3224.579 --> 3230.28
I think clammy actually

3227.099 --> 3233.9
didn't have any bad intent when he was

3230.28 --> 3233.9
saying that so clammy it's okay

3234.24 --> 3237.9599999999996
I think you just got a little bit

3235.859 --> 3240.24
carried away

3237.96 --> 3244.68
and that's kind of the similar response

3240.24 --> 3247.5589999999997
as to what like Terry 306 has sometimes

3244.68 --> 3249.5989999999997
it gets a little carried away

3247.559 --> 3250.61
I don't think the clammy meant anything

3249.599 --> 3253.2000000000003
really

3250.61 --> 3254.46
[Music]

3253.2 --> 3257.0989999999997
[Applause]

3254.46 --> 3261.26
trapping with it

3257.099 --> 3261.26
Dr Bass awkward four

3262.02 --> 3266.78
what your account has been banned again

3267.48 --> 3271.7
YouTube keeps deleting your accounts

3274.8 --> 3279.949
[Music]

3284.76 --> 3289.44
yeah that's right doctor yeah exactly if

3287.339 --> 3291.7799999999997
the Horizon was geometric then it would

3289.44 --> 3294.54
be extremely consistent

3291.78 --> 3298.94
geometrically

3294.54 --> 3298.94
but it isn't Black Swan

3301.26 --> 3306.44
we can't prove it isn't I don't get that

3303.839 --> 3306.44
part though

3309.9 --> 3314.839
but that seems not right

3316.5 --> 3320.64
so when globers

3318.359 --> 3322.44
claim refraction they debunk the globe

3320.64 --> 3325.2799999999997
yeah

3322.44 --> 3325.28
effectively

3328.44 --> 3333.7400000000002
because

3330.119 --> 3333.7400000000002
well with their refraction

3333.78 --> 3341.52
like the Horizon is not geometric

3338.099 --> 3344.46
and then they don't have any evidence

3341.52 --> 3347.4
to base the Assumption of Earth radius

3344.46 --> 3349.14
on they they have no original measured

3347.4 --> 3351.6600000000003
evidence anymore

3349.14 --> 3353.94
it's the Armenian paradox

3351.66 --> 3355.74
if you're gonna claim that the Horizon

3353.94 --> 3358.8
is refracted due to the terrestrial

3355.74 --> 3361.319
refraction well then you don't know you

3358.8 --> 3362.52
don't have a measured radius value of

3361.319 --> 3365.099
Earth anymore

3362.52 --> 3368.099
it would be impossible to attain

3365.099 --> 3370.8590000000004
you could only presuppose it

3368.099 --> 3372.7200000000003
but based on what

3370.859 --> 3374.46
based on something that you're just

3372.72 --> 3378.2
assuming and that you can't find

3374.46 --> 3378.2
physical measured evidence for

3385.319 --> 3389.07
I don't allow any clown to get me

3387.599 --> 3392.389
carried away

3389.07 --> 3392.389
[Music]

3394.22 --> 3400.2
yeah but I mean that it that's funny

3397.26 --> 3401.94
that you say that because yeah that's

3400.2 --> 3404.8799999999997
exactly what I mean

3401.94 --> 3406.8
I don't get carried away but I do get

3404.88 --> 3410.1800000000003
carried away yeah yeah that's what I

3406.8 --> 3410.1800000000003
mean Terry that's what I mean

3416.339 --> 3421.68
and yeah I mean by Maybe by Indian

3419.339 --> 3424.92
Standard that's like reasonable or

3421.68 --> 3426.2999999999997
something but over here that's like

3424.92 --> 3429.489
not

3426.3 --> 3429.489
[Music]

3429.78 --> 3434.78
although sometimes I wonder if it if it

3432.42 --> 3434.78
should be

3438.059 --> 3444.0
and I'm thinking back a lot about like

3440.52 --> 3446.52
very early Dutch times where it's like

3444.0 --> 3448.26
oh I mean there's like historical cases

3446.52 --> 3451.14
where

3448.26 --> 3454.7400000000002
the government would like

3451.14 --> 3457.6189999999997
try to like grab all the people or text

3454.74 --> 3460.2599999999998
them in a really inconvenient time

3457.619 --> 3462.6600000000003
conspiring with others

3460.26 --> 3465.3590000000004
that were Dutch and then like the Dutch

3462.66 --> 3466.68
people would go like oh oh so you're a

3465.359 --> 3468.48
traitor then

3466.68 --> 3470.5789999999997
and it would literally just drag them

3468.48 --> 3473.66
out of their houses and just stomp them

3470.579 --> 3473.6600000000003
to death in the streets

3474.18 --> 3478.22
that's how things used to happen

3479.099 --> 3484.559
and in these times I wonder if

3482.04 --> 3486.74
if we really shouldn't should have

3484.559 --> 3489.8390000000004
gotten rid of that

3486.74 --> 3492.4199999999996
Barbara's way of doing things when it it

3489.839 --> 3495.0589999999997
actually does work though

3492.42 --> 3497.04
it is a good deterrent that like oh

3495.059 --> 3499.44
somebody's like oh maybe we could [ __ ]

3497.04 --> 3500.64
over these people and rip them off get

3499.44 --> 3503.819
them killed

3500.64 --> 3508.2
well if they knew like oh yeah yeah that

3503.819 --> 3510.0589999999997
guy tried that last year he got stomped

3508.2 --> 3512.3999999999996
to death in the streets

3510.059 --> 3514.92
yeah that that's a deterrent you see

3512.4 --> 3517.559
that makes criminal Psychopaths think

3514.92 --> 3519.299
like maybe it's too risky to go here

3517.559 --> 3521.46
maybe I should try another country where

3519.299 --> 3525.98
they're more wisified

3521.46 --> 3525.98
where they just let it all happen yeah

3528.54 --> 3531.74
that's the issue

3535.799 --> 3541.38
if you let them get away with it because

3537.9 --> 3544.92
you're too civilized well you're too

3541.38 --> 3549.059
civilization is going to [ __ ] burn to

3544.92 --> 3550.5
the ground then [ __ ] you're too

3549.059 --> 3553.92
civilized

3550.5 --> 3555.24
to get violent well then die

3553.92 --> 3558.9
because

3555.24 --> 3562.02
this is not oh we're such special Boys

3558.9 --> 3564.82
in how civilized we are okay that's not

3562.02 --> 3567.919
the moment for that

3564.82 --> 3567.9190000000003
[Music]

3575.18 --> 3580.74
well in ways it still is I mean if you

3578.28 --> 3582.6600000000003
literally throw off all the change of

3580.74 --> 3584.7599999999998
civilization then it's just gonna be

3582.66 --> 3587.8799999999997
pure Carnage so

3584.76 --> 3591.1800000000003
it is good to still have some standards

3587.88 --> 3596.7200000000003
but I mean it's not back bad to like

3591.18 --> 3596.72
grab back to old ways of doing things

3597.119 --> 3602.48
it's like oh we're getting exterminated

3599.819 --> 3606.839
like very visibly

3602.48 --> 3608.46
measurably well then it's time to

3606.839 --> 3611.2799999999997
remember back

3608.46 --> 3613.26
to your ancestors

3611.28 --> 3616.5
now this is part of the message that I

3613.26 --> 3619.44
had for France when I got all fired up

3616.5 --> 3622.26
like don't you remember

3619.44 --> 3624.0
like your ancestors they lived in a

3622.26 --> 3627.92
France that was getting attacked from

3624.0 --> 3627.92
all sides continually

3629.04 --> 3634.619
and like Frenchmen against Frenchmen

3632.04 --> 3638.48
even like it was war all the [ __ ]

3634.619 --> 3638.48
time with France it was yeah

3639.119 --> 3644.46
but there were plenty

3641.88 --> 3646.559
of French professional Souls that just

3644.46 --> 3648.18
kept going I actually have a movie of

3646.559 --> 3650.8190000000004
that

3648.18 --> 3654.1189999999997
what's it called it was one of those

3650.819 --> 3656.9
movies with that great actor in it also

3654.119 --> 3656.9
played Aragorn

3658.619 --> 3663.599
I had

3660.0 --> 3665.819
I have it somewhere but it's about a

3663.599 --> 3668.099
French soldier

3665.819 --> 3670.92
and he just won battle to the other and

3668.099 --> 3673.26
just and they're yeah just keeps going

3670.92 --> 3676.64
and keeps going

3673.26 --> 3676.6400000000003
not The Shining

3683.599 --> 3687.44
what the hell was it called

3735.079 --> 3742.2000000000003
dude what the [ __ ] is this hey

3739.2 --> 3745.3799999999997
what the hell

3742.2 --> 3747.5989999999997
I thought I lost this thing

3745.38 --> 3749.76
I thought it was stolen

3747.599 --> 3752.88
apparently it wasn't another drawer what

3749.76 --> 3755.7200000000003
the hell okay

3752.88 --> 3755.7200000000003
that's good

3759.96 --> 3763.4
this one no

3765.119 --> 3768.02
we're cool

3779.24 --> 3782.8999999999996
I think it's here

3783.54 --> 3786.5
the one

3786.9 --> 3790.46
yeah this is the one

3790.88 --> 3794.599
a la Trista

3794.819 --> 3801.5
that's the movie I'm talking about

3796.5 --> 3801.5
that's some French ass

3801.619 --> 3806.579
that's

3803.579 --> 3808.02
yeah France hey hey you want to know

3806.579 --> 3810.299
what to do

3808.02 --> 3812.7
want to get back to some Roots watch

3810.299 --> 3814.98
this freaking movie Man

3812.7 --> 3817.6189999999997
watch this one

3814.98 --> 3820.619
another twist

3817.619 --> 3822.48
it's kind of a it's not a very happy

3820.619 --> 3824.099
movie

3822.48 --> 3826.92
but it is

3824.099 --> 3830.339
pretty real and it I mean it has Viggo

3826.92 --> 3832.619
mortens in it so it almost has to be

3830.339 --> 3835.099
badass

3832.619 --> 3835.099
anyway

3842.04 --> 3847.2
why are you talking about how can

3843.839 --> 3849.299
someone steal from me what is it in

3847.2 --> 3852.3799999999997
French I think so

3849.299 --> 3852.38
I think it is actually

3857.52 --> 3862.579
it is one of those multi-language movies

3866.04 --> 3872.099
but the main character is French I think

3869.28 --> 3873.7200000000003
it's mostly French some Spanish and some

3872.099 --> 3877.02
english that's about it's like one of

3873.72 --> 3880.9399999999996
those multilingual language movies

3877.02 --> 3880.94
and it to be fair

3883.5 --> 3889.339
it's not like a super movie but it is a

3886.98 --> 3889.339
good movie

3892.38 --> 3894.619
foreign

3909.38 --> 3914.54
that's hilarious that I actually find

3912.24 --> 3917.5789999999997
use for my DVDs

3914.54 --> 3920.04
because that's all covered in dust I

3917.579 --> 3922.88
haven't touched any of that in like

3920.04 --> 3922.88
12 years

3924.72 --> 3930.14
was fun that I remembered having that

3926.64 --> 3930.14
movie though I like that

3944.819 --> 3947.88
what are you talking about Supreme

3946.44 --> 3951.02
knowing I'm

3947.88 --> 3951.02
it's confusing me

3974.46 --> 3980.94
what are you talking about David yeah

3977.579 --> 3983.4
that's evil nightmare he has evil like a

3980.94 --> 3984.48
kumu virus is literally allowed in my

3983.4 --> 3988.02
chat

3984.48 --> 3990.68
but he has something's blocking him and

3988.02 --> 3990.68
it's not me

3991.2 --> 3996.299
so I don't know

3992.88 --> 4001.119
I don't see a kumu virus as it is it

3996.299 --> 4001.119
as like a belligerent troll

4001.16 --> 4007.7799999999997
or a malignant troll

4004.4 --> 4007.78
I don't see him like that

4022.18 --> 4026.2599999999998
so what are you talking about

4036.079 --> 4040.42
The Silo no never heard of it

4040.7 --> 4044.5389999999998
it's hard to steal from my place

4043.039 --> 4047.1800000000003
yeah

4044.539 --> 4049.5200000000004
I know

4047.18 --> 4052.16
I make sure it is

4049.52 --> 4054.339
me being here all the time is part of

4052.16 --> 4054.339
that

4058.579 --> 4063.28
light is not a wave through the over

4061.039 --> 4063.28
comfort

4066.859 --> 4073.119
it's not about believing light are not

4070.46 --> 4073.119
waves

4073.46 --> 4079.7
they're instantaneous beams

4076.579 --> 4082.579
and you could think of them as particles

4079.7 --> 4085.7
like a gigantic cluster of particles but

4082.579 --> 4089.2000000000003
I mean it's instantaneous so

4085.7 --> 4089.2
yeah they're not waves

4089.9 --> 4094.96
even electromagnetic wave is not

4092.539 --> 4099.02
actually a wave light is not a wave

4094.96 --> 4101.96
arguably radio is not a wave

4099.02 --> 4103.64
they all just call it waves because they

4101.96 --> 4106.52
were [ __ ] and I wanted to confuse

4103.64 --> 4109.339
the [ __ ] out of everybody

4106.52 --> 4111.38
to make it their little Guild Niche like

4109.339 --> 4113.66
their like the electricians are the only

4111.38 --> 4115.46
ones that actually understand it I don't

4113.66 --> 4117.259
know what why they did it but it's not

4115.46 --> 4118.94
waves none of it is waved it's

4117.259 --> 4120.5
ridiculous that it's all called like

4118.94 --> 4124.839
that

4120.5 --> 4124.839
yeah light is not a wave

4125.239 --> 4131.7789999999995
but yes actual refraction light does

4128.779 --> 4135.46
change angle

4131.779 --> 4139.040000000001
when it transits from one distinctly

4135.46 --> 4142.54
distinct medium to another

4139.04 --> 4142.54
like from Air to glass

4143.9 --> 4149.299
water to air

4146.12 --> 4151.46
where the refraction index is

4149.299 --> 4154.06
significantly different

4151.46 --> 4158.299
we then have a hard medium transition

4154.06 --> 4162.259
and the light will change angle

4158.299 --> 4163.759
while entering the new medium

4162.259 --> 4167.839
but it's not a wave and it's

4163.759 --> 4170.779
instantaneous doesn't slow down either

4167.839 --> 4172.64
that's all [ __ ] myth who it goes

4170.779 --> 4176.06
through the heavier medium so now it's

4172.64 --> 4179.08
slower [ __ ] it's not slower it's

4176.06 --> 4182.1990000000005
instantaneous yeah instantane

4179.08 --> 4184.04
instantaneous how do you say that

4182.199 --> 4187.5199999999995
instantaneousness

4184.04 --> 4190.42
does not speed up or slow down it's

4187.52 --> 4190.42
instantaneous

4190.52 --> 4195.1
it's just instantaneous that's it

4196.1 --> 4198.34
foreign

4206.32 --> 4210.5599999999995
yeah that's so very cute but it isn't a

4209.3 --> 4213.860000000001
wave

4210.56 --> 4216.860000000001
none of it is waves it's all

4213.86 --> 4219.639999999999
infinitely divisible beams that are

4216.86 --> 4219.639999999999
instantaneous

4221.179 --> 4226.34
yeah it's not a wave

4225.02 --> 4231.320000000001
wave

4226.34 --> 4233.659000000001
has speed as an unconcedent

4231.32 --> 4236.0
and it doesn't have a speed

4233.659 --> 4238.46
because it doesn't move it just

4236.0 --> 4239.659
manifests

4238.46 --> 4243.679
clean

4239.659 --> 4246.639999999999
just there cling all simultaneously

4243.679 --> 4246.64
it's just there

4248.88 --> 4252.079
[Music]

4264.78 --> 4270.2
[Music]

4271.58 --> 4280.3
an electromagnetic radiation

4275.239 --> 4280.299999999999
wave like behavior is absolute horseshit

4280.4 --> 4285.679
Anything

4281.679 --> 4285.679
Electric magnetic

4285.86 --> 4293.48
is all field based yeah magnetic fields

4296.12 --> 4303.04
field not a wave it's a field it's just

4300.02 --> 4303.040000000001
a field yeah

4307.58 --> 4314.14
this entire wave nonsense it's barely

4311.36 --> 4314.139999999999
even present

4314.719 --> 4320.199
did you know that sound isn't even

4317.06 --> 4320.1990000000005
technically a wave

4323.3 --> 4328.46
it's rather like a a cymatic pressure

4326.239 --> 4330.379999999999
distribution it's like a pressure

4328.46 --> 4333.04
distribution

4330.38 --> 4335.3
but it's instantaneous like it all

4333.04 --> 4337.699
instantaneously starts

4335.3 --> 4339.1990000000005
vibrating right this is how sound

4337.699 --> 4343.599999999999
happens not

4339.199 --> 4343.599999999999
um no it happens like this

4343.76 --> 4350.0
that's why speaker does that

4347.36 --> 4353.78
because sound

4350.0 --> 4357.62
really kind of is in the wave either oh

4353.78 --> 4361.4
oh oh yeah yeah I said it yeah that's

4357.62 --> 4363.679
right sound actually isn't really a wave

4361.4 --> 4365.839999999999
you could actually argue that waves

4363.679 --> 4369.38
don't even exist

4365.84 --> 4373.0
except maybe in water on the ocean

4369.38 --> 4373.0
like okay that's a wave

4373.219 --> 4378.44
it's a giant body doing something and

4375.5 --> 4382.46
it's showing a wave-like pattern

4378.44 --> 4385.46
but things and substances they're not

4382.46 --> 4387.76
waves light is not a wave sound is not a

4385.46 --> 4387.76
wave

4388.52 --> 4393.9800000000005
you know

4389.9 --> 4397.339999999999
and magnetism is not a wave either

4393.98 --> 4400.239
an electricity is not a wave like that

4397.34 --> 4403.659000000001
none of it is waves

4400.239 --> 4403.659
none of it

4405.219 --> 4411.02
they just infected you with wave

4408.92 --> 4414.02
thoughts

4411.02 --> 4416.2390000000005
wave patterns and now you think it's

4414.02 --> 4418.1
always well guess what none of it is

4416.239 --> 4420.259999999999
waves

4418.1 --> 4424.659000000001
none of it is

4420.26 --> 4428.679
yeah it's all Fields beams particles

4424.659 --> 4428.679
there is no waves

4431.68 --> 4434.719
[Music]

4440.179 --> 4446.12
sound has a speed though well it has a

4443.239 --> 4450.08
speed in which it the effect perpetuates

4446.12 --> 4452.84
itself but the effect is not a wave

4450.08 --> 4456.0199999999995
it's not going like this

4452.84 --> 4458.2390000000005
yeah it's going like this and that

4456.02 --> 4461.780000000001
effect yeah that can

4458.239 --> 4464.419999999999
like one part of air bumps against the

4461.78 --> 4467.48
other and basically makes it resonate

4464.42 --> 4469.1
and so it it does move

4467.48 --> 4472.5199999999995
yeah it does

4469.1 --> 4475.780000000001
move sound has a speed but it's

4472.52 --> 4475.780000000001
technically not a wave

4477.739 --> 4482.919999999999
yeah sound is not light light is

4480.14 --> 4482.92
instantaneous

4484.76 --> 4491.679
everything is slower than light

4487.52 --> 4491.679
unless it's instantaneous like light

4497.55 --> 4502.159000000001
[Music]

4500.0 --> 4503.179
why do you get Peaks and troughs in

4502.159 --> 4506.36
sound

4503.179 --> 4508.4800000000005
because of resonance because of like how

4506.36 --> 4511.58
the

4508.48 --> 4514.82
pressurized regions that are effectively

4511.58 --> 4517.58
the sound or the cymatics how they are

4514.82 --> 4519.62
able to distribute right there's a

4517.58 --> 4522.08
pattern in how everything resonates

4519.62 --> 4524.719
within the room sound wise

4522.08 --> 4526.46
it all shaking there shaking there

4524.719 --> 4529.4800000000005
shaking there in a certain pattern

4526.46 --> 4529.4800000000005
dividing itself

4529.76 --> 4535.6990000000005
like in cells yeah sound

4533.12 --> 4538.159
is like resonating space that divides

4535.699 --> 4539.659
itself in cells within the available

4538.159 --> 4542.48
volume

4539.659 --> 4545.0199999999995
within the chamber That's How Sound

4542.48 --> 4545.0199999999995
Works

4545.48 --> 4551.62
and so there are depending on the room

4548.42 --> 4554.96
and then on the south influx

4551.62 --> 4557.12
ideal points where this sound is like

4554.96 --> 4559.46
maximum combined and that's how you then

4557.12 --> 4562.28
get oh this is like the best part for

4559.46 --> 4567.44
the sound in the room

4562.28 --> 4570.679
it's because that's how we

4567.44 --> 4573.739
the moving bodies of the air

4570.679 --> 4576.02
the shaking bodies of the air

4573.739 --> 4578.659
divide themselves within the available

4576.02 --> 4580.46
room and then there are some spots that

4578.659 --> 4582.339999999999
are just that happen to get the

4580.46 --> 4585.5
concentrated

4582.34 --> 4587.06
maximum shaky effect so they get the

4585.5 --> 4589.1
more sound well because what a sound the

4587.06 --> 4590.659000000001
sound is that shakiness Yeah the more

4589.1 --> 4594.1990000000005
the shakiness the louder it is

4590.659 --> 4596.96
effectively Within the body

4594.199 --> 4597.678999999999
of the sound that's happening within a

4596.96 --> 4601.12
room

4597.679 --> 4601.12
so that's why

4601.34 --> 4607.0
that's why you have ideal points of

4604.1 --> 4607.0
sound in a room

4608.86 --> 4613.46
learned a lot from these live streams

4610.94 --> 4615.08
yeah you're welcome Nathan R I

4613.46 --> 4617.179
appreciate it

4615.08 --> 4618.86
I appreciate the ability to be able to

4617.179 --> 4622.2390000000005
do that

4618.86 --> 4624.82
and this thing is by the way

4622.239 --> 4628.5199999999995
Owen Benjamin brought this up first

4624.82 --> 4630.38
about the sound thing

4628.52 --> 4632.06
because I already knew it I knew I

4630.38 --> 4635.3
learned in schools like yeah you have to

4632.06 --> 4637.6990000000005
snare of a guitar and that's like a real

4635.3 --> 4639.9800000000005
sound wave yeah what do you call that

4637.699 --> 4642.62
again amplitudinal

4639.98 --> 4646.239
and

4642.62 --> 4646.239
I forgot the other one

4649.34 --> 4653.2390000000005
[ __ ]

4650.78 --> 4655.759999999999
but the point is is that amplitudinal

4653.239 --> 4658.639999999999
sound that's this that's the actual

4655.76 --> 4662.96
sound that we experience in the world

4658.64 --> 4666.219
well the other one which is like a snare

4662.96 --> 4666.219
that's very unusual

4666.32 --> 4669.679
damn it doesn't even like to stay out of

4668.48 --> 4672.379999999999
one again

4669.679 --> 4675.159
no not frequency

4672.38 --> 4675.159000000001
is the form

4675.27 --> 4685.120000000001
[Music]

4682.159 --> 4685.12
foreign

4701.42 --> 4706.28
yeah it's a longitudinal wave that's the

4704.659 --> 4710.739
one I'm talking about that's actually

4706.28 --> 4710.739
sound but you have another form

4713.62 --> 4720.94
I forgot what that's called but it's

4716.54 --> 4720.94
like they're the vibrating of a snare

4722.3 --> 4727.58
all right

4723.94 --> 4730.9
but sound is yeah they they call it a

4727.58 --> 4730.9
longitudinal wave

4731.659 --> 4736.099999999999
but that's because of

4734.36 --> 4739.0
the effect

4736.1 --> 4739.0
moving

4745.04 --> 4751.84
and it is moving

4747.02 --> 4751.84
but it's not like a wave of water

4754.46 --> 4762.7390000000005
it's actually well yeah the air just

4759.26 --> 4766.34
broadening up Smalling down

4762.739 --> 4768.259999999999
and it does move that effect and that's

4766.34 --> 4771.52
what yeah the longitudinal wave and

4768.26 --> 4771.52
that's really the real sound

4773.02 --> 4778.159000000001
and that's also like the effect that

4775.76 --> 4780.6990000000005
like makes a shock wave from an

4778.159 --> 4780.699
explosion

4781.82 --> 4787.239
it's longitudinal waves

4784.699 --> 4787.239
pressure

4792.62 --> 4798.14
no not a sine wave not a square wave

4795.699 --> 4801.08
transverse that's the one I think yeah

4798.14 --> 4804.400000000001
transverse wave thanks iron 26 yeah

4801.08 --> 4804.4
that's the one I was looking for

4807.44 --> 4813.0199999999995
my transverse is the actual

4810.44 --> 4817.879999999999
like a snare

4813.02 --> 4820.52
stuck it's stuck and then you go ding

4817.88 --> 4823.219
that's a transverse wave

4820.52 --> 4824.71
and transfers wave that snare actually

4823.219 --> 4826.46
gives off

4824.71 --> 4828.8
[Music]

4826.46 --> 4833.44
the other one

4828.8 --> 4833.4400000000005
it gives off longitudinal waves

4834.08 --> 4841.36
but the effect itself of the sound

4837.199 --> 4841.36
origin is transverse that's right

4854.36 --> 4860.78
right so yeah not really a wave

4858.56 --> 4865.659000000001
but it does move

4860.78 --> 4865.659
potentially like a wave in a big body

4866.22 --> 4869.419
[Music]

4895.76 --> 4899.3
the truth over Comfort what are you

4897.56 --> 4903.280000000001
doing with all this [ __ ] message

4899.3 --> 4903.28
retractions what are you doing

4934.48 --> 4939.98
oh damn time has flown I feel a lot

4937.76 --> 4941.6
better by the way

4939.98 --> 4944.48
ah

4941.6 --> 4947.06
I really did not feel good when the show

4944.48 --> 4948.5
started at all

4947.06 --> 4950.719
what now

4948.5 --> 4953.32
I feel better also it's a bit of Sun so

4950.719 --> 4953.32
that's kind of nice

4953.48 --> 4958.9
all right what the hell did we talk

4955.159 --> 4958.9
about and I need to figure out a title

4966.62 --> 4970.84
maybe I call it no waves in nature

4972.68 --> 4978.6990000000005
[Music]

4980.99 --> 4984.219999999999
[Music]

4997.34 --> 5001.7390000000005
no waves in nature but the sea

5002.679 --> 5005.4
why not

5005.92 --> 5007.9800000000005
okay

5008.04 --> 5011.229
[Music]

5015.64 --> 5020.88
start his own show with yeah that's very

5018.04 --> 5020.88
funny clammy

5022.48 --> 5030.099999999999
but that's the gesture that is named a

5026.92 --> 5032.64
wave that's not actually a a physical

5030.1 --> 5032.64
thing

5034.199 --> 5042.36
it's a gesture not a

5038.26 --> 5042.360000000001
a substantial property

5046.78 --> 5050.0199999999995
we started this wave that's a good

5048.88 --> 5053.02
question

5050.02 --> 5055.4800000000005
I've been asking that myself who the

5053.02 --> 5057.219
hell did that who started this [ __ ]

5055.48 --> 5059.08
about waves all the time

5057.219 --> 5061.659
where did that start

5059.08 --> 5064.0599999999995
I mean even Tesla was talking [ __ ] about

5061.659 --> 5067.179
waves all the time

5064.06 --> 5068.92
who was the guy was it Tesla was it

5067.179 --> 5071.62
[ __ ] Tesla

5068.92 --> 5075.179
that actually got us all talking about

5071.62 --> 5075.179
ether and wave nonsense

5075.28 --> 5079.84
was it him

5076.9 --> 5082.48
or was before him

5079.84 --> 5086.4400000000005
officially already people everybody just

5082.48 --> 5089.139999999999
talking about waves waves waves

5086.44 --> 5091.44
maybe flood Justin was a wave too I

5089.14 --> 5091.4400000000005
don't know

5092.82 --> 5098.38
but for me it does kind of stand out

5095.38 --> 5101.38
that Tesla really Nikola Tesla talked

5098.38 --> 5103.900000000001
about waves with a lot of things that he

5101.38 --> 5109.1990000000005
really seemed into that

5103.9 --> 5109.199
but in retrospect it all seems so wrong

5115.8 --> 5124.02
waves of light no light is in the wave

5121.48 --> 5126.94
and it doesn't have a speed yeah

5124.02 --> 5130.4400000000005
transverse wave

5126.94 --> 5130.44
that has a speed

5131.02 --> 5136.6
now it might be a transverse induction

5134.14 --> 5139.62
effect that's what people say out there

5136.6 --> 5142.06
that are more into it into electrics

5139.62 --> 5144.46
it's an induction effect but it is

5142.06 --> 5148.320000000001
instantaneous so it's an instantaneous

5144.46 --> 5151.6
thing that Bridges everything and then

5148.32 --> 5154.659
it might be

5151.6 --> 5157.659000000001
like a transverse effect like where it

5154.659 --> 5162.78
like the light manifests simultaneously

5157.659 --> 5164.92
maybe a bit like a a universal

5162.78 --> 5167.159
instantaneous yeah but that makes no

5164.92 --> 5167.159
sense

5167.32 --> 5172.239
I mean you might compare light more to

5170.02 --> 5175.3
like a cymatics effect right because

5172.239 --> 5179.4
it's like you at least cymatics sound to

5175.3 --> 5182.4400000000005
a room it all instantaneously vibrates

5179.4 --> 5184.179
it doesn't go oh this side vibrates and

5182.44 --> 5187.0599999999995
then that one and then that one and then

5184.179 --> 5191.08
that one no no it all goes

5187.06 --> 5196.8
oh at the same time so if light

5191.08 --> 5196.8
light might have like a weird underlying

5198.88 --> 5204.42
not transverse for [ __ ] sake ah

5205.0 --> 5209.1
the other one damn it

5212.56 --> 5217.06
longitudinal

5215.199 --> 5221.138999999999
right there might be a longitudinal

5217.06 --> 5223.7390000000005
effect to light as in how it manifests

5221.139 --> 5227.7390000000005
but it is instantaneous it's not like

5223.739 --> 5231.5199999999995
moving from one part to another it's

5227.739 --> 5233.799999999999
everywhere at the same time it manifests

5231.52 --> 5236.860000000001
and there might be

5233.8 --> 5239.1990000000005
and longitudinal effect to that

5236.86 --> 5242.86
to the light itself

5239.199 --> 5244.78
who knows I don't know but I do know it

5242.86 --> 5247.179
does not have the speed so it does not

5244.78 --> 5249.34
classify a wave

5247.179 --> 5252.84
it has no speed it can't be a wave

5249.34 --> 5252.84
doesn't work like that

5253.3 --> 5257.92
why do people talk about the speed of

5255.52 --> 5260.52
light because it was presupposed to have

5257.92 --> 5260.52
a speed

5260.98 --> 5266.678999999999
they need it to have a speed you see if

5263.92 --> 5268.719
light doesn't have a speed then their

5266.679 --> 5270.219
Universe model doesn't work then they

5268.719 --> 5272.679
can't claim

5270.219 --> 5275.08
that the universe is super old because

5272.679 --> 5278.08
of redshift

5275.08 --> 5280.6
because light from billions of years ago

5278.08 --> 5282.76
traveled all that way

5280.6 --> 5285.52
to reach here so we're seeing things

5282.76 --> 5287.1990000000005
from billions of years ago well they

5285.52 --> 5291.040000000001
claim that

5287.199 --> 5292.599999999999
because light in their model has to have

5291.04 --> 5295.6
a speed

5292.6 --> 5297.159000000001
so it's heliocentric that light has to

5295.6 --> 5300.219
have a speed but it's never been

5297.159 --> 5301.679
measured it's only been calculated based

5300.219 --> 5304.179
on the freaking

5301.679 --> 5306.6990000000005
celestials so with the freaking

5304.179 --> 5309.58
presupposition of a distance to those

5306.699 --> 5313.178999999999
celestials and then supposedly

5309.58 --> 5315.94
measuring how long it takes

5313.179 --> 5317.08
it's all ridiculous mathematical

5315.94 --> 5319.0
nonsense

5317.08 --> 5321.84
there is no measured speed of light it's

5319.0 --> 5321.84
instantaneous

5325.48 --> 5331.178999999999
how can you say what

5328.659 --> 5333.82
microphone to an oscilloscope to see the

5331.179 --> 5338.32
way yeah that's an oscilloscope that's a

5333.82 --> 5341.0199999999995
scope it's showing you a pattern

5338.32 --> 5343.36
and because that pattern looks like a

5341.02 --> 5346.1990000000005
wave doesn't mean it's literally a wave

5343.36 --> 5346.199
clammy

5346.48 --> 5354.339999999999
yeah because a screen readout shows you

5350.5 --> 5358.12
a line that looks like a wave doesn't

5354.34 --> 5363.219
mean that sound is a wave

5358.12 --> 5363.219
it means that the visual representation

5364.08 --> 5370.199
is showing you a wave

5366.88 --> 5370.1990000000005
that's what that means

5382.48 --> 5387.4
they use measure speeds like every yeah

5384.58 --> 5389.98
no they didn't it's [ __ ] all they

5387.4 --> 5392.379999999999
ever use is just some stupid telescope

5389.98 --> 5394.839999999999
laser thing shoot it at a [ __ ] star

5392.38 --> 5397.96
or the moon or whatever

5394.84 --> 5400.179
and then based on the distance that I

5397.96 --> 5402.58
assume that Celestial body to have based

5400.179 --> 5405.6990000000005
on the heliocentric model

5402.58 --> 5410.34
they then calculate

5405.699 --> 5410.339999999999
how long it takes it's all horseshit

5410.92 --> 5414.719
there is no measure to be a light

5420.639 --> 5424.56
hello Thomas Young oh wow

5428.86 --> 5434.799999999999
yeah who cares if he was a Freemason

5431.08 --> 5437.92
double slit experiment is dude Thomas

5434.8 --> 5439.3
Young is a [ __ ] [ __ ] if he did that

5437.92 --> 5444.4
yeah

5439.3 --> 5446.62
it's a wave pattern yeah the double slit

5444.4 --> 5449.32
is a wave pattern you know what the

5446.62 --> 5452.679
actual phenomenon is in that

5449.32 --> 5455.199
it's not light being a wave it's a

5452.679 --> 5457.139
diffraction Cascade

5455.199 --> 5460.659
it's a diffraction

5457.139 --> 5462.76
Cascade unique to light not other matter

5460.659 --> 5465.759999999999
despite what everybody [ __ ] says

5462.76 --> 5468.280000000001
including QE yeah all other things

5465.76 --> 5471.76
beside light they only split up in three

5468.28 --> 5475.08
bands Max light is the only thing that

5471.76 --> 5478.360000000001
splits up in

5475.08 --> 5482.04
unlimited amounts potentially

5478.36 --> 5485.679
because it has a unique diffraction

5482.04 --> 5488.199
Cascade effect to it yeah and the

5485.679 --> 5491.159
pattern in which that light Cascades

5488.199 --> 5496.48
through the double slit has been

5491.159 --> 5501.46
identified as a wave like pattern it's

5496.48 --> 5503.62
like the way it's distributed like

5501.46 --> 5506.5
feet you could like mathematically

5503.62 --> 5509.44
extrapolate that and see like oh that's

5506.5 --> 5512.56
almost like as if light were a wave it's

5509.44 --> 5516.339999999999
it's like a wave-like pattern yeah but

5512.56 --> 5518.7390000000005
it's not a wave because every light band

5516.34 --> 5520.360000000001
that you see projected on the wall after

5518.739 --> 5524.5599999999995
having gone through the double slit

5520.36 --> 5528.28
guess what all of that light all moved

5524.56 --> 5530.34
in a perfect straight line every bit

5528.28 --> 5532.9
a straight straight

5530.34 --> 5535.2390000000005
yeah you can put all the bits in between

5532.9 --> 5538.138999999999
it's not gonna do anything because light

5535.239 --> 5542.08
is not a wave all those diffraction

5538.139 --> 5545.1990000000005
cascaded light beams go perfectly

5542.08 --> 5548.139
straight from the slit on

5545.199 --> 5551.799999999999
because it's the diffraction Cascade

5548.139 --> 5554.04
that's the phenomenon not light being a

5551.8 --> 5554.04
wave

5554.8 --> 5559.96
it isn't a wave

5557.199 --> 5563.82
it's an instantaneous infinitely

5559.96 --> 5563.82
divisible beam

5564.34 --> 5571.2390000000005
and it has diffraction Cascade

5568.0 --> 5573.48
and that's really weird and unique to

5571.239 --> 5573.48
light

5576.94 --> 5579.82
the two ways well

5578.8 --> 5582.52
right

5579.82 --> 5583.84
no it isn't the art Sanford there is no

5582.52 --> 5585.580000000001
two-way speed of light there's no

5583.84 --> 5587.62
one-way speed of light

5585.58 --> 5590.159
there is no speed of light it's all

5587.62 --> 5590.159
calculated

5594.46 --> 5598.9
I have not proven instantaneous speed of

5597.159 --> 5601.239
light there is no measured speed of

5598.9 --> 5603.28
light glammy there is no measured speed

5601.239 --> 5605.5599999999995
of light there is no measured speed of

5603.28 --> 5609.219
light there is no measured speed of

5605.56 --> 5613.179
light no measured speed of light no

5609.219 --> 5615.82
measured speed of light no measured

5613.179 --> 5618.46
speed of light and if you're going to

5615.82 --> 5620.86
assume that other things are alight too

5618.46 --> 5623.32
when they are not and then you measure

5620.86 --> 5626.139
the speed of that thing that doesn't

5623.32 --> 5628.54
prove that light has a speed it doesn't

5626.139 --> 5633.28
it's instantaneous

5628.54 --> 5637.44
light has no speed it's instantaneous

5633.28 --> 5637.44
there is no measured speed of light

5638.44 --> 5642.159
right and I'm gonna run out the show now

5640.719 --> 5644.38
because the Flat Earth debate is

5642.159 --> 5647.0199999999995
starting up so thanks everyone for

5644.38 --> 5648.6990000000005
coming I hope you like this show

5647.02 --> 5649.780000000001
turned out to be better than I thought

5648.699 --> 5651.94
it would

5649.78 --> 5654.159
but anyway if you liked it please don't

number 1653

5679.239 --> 5683.32
on a Friday and I'm going to join the

5681.76 --> 5685.360000000001
Flat Earth debates over Nathan Oakley

5683.32 --> 5686.86
1980 Channel which is already started up

5685.36 --> 5690.67
so I hope to see you there in the chat

5686.86 --> 5705.38
and until the next video keep it flat

5690.67 --> 5705.38
