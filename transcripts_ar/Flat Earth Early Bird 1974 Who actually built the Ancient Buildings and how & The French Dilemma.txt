that yeah still the same

200.319 --> 205.79899999999998

202.4 --> 208.799
rainy June over here in the Netherlands

205.799 --> 208.799

225.68 --> 228.92000000000002
good I

228.959 --> 233.31900000000002
thought

230.519 --> 237.04
especially the last part I really got

233.319 --> 237.04
focused again

244.799 --> 249.76000000000002
and yeah just before the show I was yeah

247.84 --> 252.31900000000002
part part of the reason I was late I was

249.76 --> 254.319
watching a video I completely forgot to

252.319 --> 259.239
watch it

254.319 --> 259.239
yesterday but uh what

262.32 --> 270.8
it yeah Old World

265.6 --> 270.8
Order about tartaria basically

272.759 --> 280.84000000000003
I still like I got like at half or

277.16 --> 280.84000000000003
something I need to watch

281.08 --> 284.59999999999997
more but yeah

285.24 --> 293.16
yesterday I got too

288.68 --> 293.16
distracted and I completely forgot about

295.199 --> 301.639
it watching a bunch of Alex Jones and in

299.199 --> 301.639
uh

303.28 --> 306.59999999999997
home Benjamin

334.88 --> 339.15999999999997
was hilarious oh Benjamin like had all

337.44 --> 342.4
these

339.16 --> 345.199
videos showing off that like when he

342.4 --> 348.15999999999997
calls the goats they just come to

345.199 --> 351.759
him like even at a vast

348.16 --> 351.759
distance like goat

353.16 --> 357.84000000000003
rallies that was pretty awesome

360.8 --> 364.88
right so I got some Tamara coffee

362.95 --> 370.479
[Music]

364.88 --> 373.88
here and huh a regular cross

370.479 --> 373.88
all they

374.16 --> 382.12
uh didn't have the Illuminati

378.36 --> 384.52000000000004
C yesterday I'm going to try again

382.12 --> 387.16
today not going through the rain

384.52 --> 389.08
yesterday I basically went through the

387.16 --> 392.56
rain and then they didn't have

389.08 --> 396.639
Illuminati on that was a real

392.56 --> 400.84
bummer but oh well luxury problems right

396.639 --> 400.84000000000003
doesn't really matter that much

401.2 --> 407.49
[Music]

421.56 --> 428.039
yeah I really need to get

424.039 --> 428.039
some get some Focus

436.16 --> 441.8
here hope everybody watching is doing

438.8 --> 441.8
okay

470.28 --> 473.75899999999996
yeah there's a whole bunch of stuff

471.879 --> 476.84000000000003
happening in

473.759 --> 481.199
politics but I mean yeah don't really

476.84 --> 484.19899999999996
want to bore you too much with that

481.199 --> 487.479
but apparently around Europe elections

484.199 --> 491.96000000000004
and all that there are more this SCT

487.479 --> 494.28
moves away from the the the left which

491.96 --> 494.28
is

498.159 --> 505.159
great cuz the bow left is just making a

502.24 --> 505.159
giant mess of

505.28 --> 510.19899999999996
everything and much further

516.039 --> 519.08
right but

527.0 --> 531.399
yeah so yeah everything is just

534.64 --> 540.88
fine I hope a lot of people out

537.959 --> 543.4799999999999
there that you trusted God that

540.88 --> 545.36
everything is fine that maybe with

543.48 --> 548.6
moments you think like oh my God

545.36 --> 548.6
everything is going to go to

550.92 --> 555.88
hell

552.6 --> 559.76
well not

555.88 --> 559.76
really might feel like

559.8 --> 565.4399999999999
that but there's always a balance

563.079 --> 568.8389999999999
counterbalance that just

565.44 --> 571.44
happens and a lot of what we are exposed

568.839 --> 574.1600000000001
to through media and everything is not

571.44 --> 578.44
properly balanced that's like kind of

574.16 --> 581.04
what they do they keep all they try to

578.44 --> 583.0790000000001
erase things that are not convenient to

581.04 --> 585.76
their

583.079 --> 589.64
narrative but it doesn't actually work I

585.76 --> 593.399
mean it it works they make it they weave

589.64 --> 596.3199999999999
that into their Judicial System their

593.399 --> 600.64
judicial system which is not the or a

596.32 --> 603.1600000000001
proper or even a lawful one

600.64 --> 606.279
it's like memory

603.16 --> 608.8389999999999
engineering and yeah you can't get

606.279 --> 613.32
really demoralized just by the damage

608.839 --> 616.8000000000001
that they do that way but I mean

613.32 --> 619.72
it's it's not actually

616.8 --> 624.24
gone those things that they

619.72 --> 624.24
just try to eras and everything

624.56 --> 630.92
so with a swing

627.6 --> 633.0790000000001
back which apparently has

630.92 --> 635.1999999999999
happened yeah a lot of that can

633.079 --> 638.7199999999999
basically just be restored and and it

635.2 --> 641.72
will be like it was never there or

638.72 --> 643.32
barely hopefully we'll see I don't know

641.72 --> 645.519
I don't know what I'm talking about

643.32 --> 645.519
right

647.2 --> 650.2
now

650.36 --> 658.24
politics esoterics of politics I mean

655.519 --> 661.16
the

658.24 --> 663.5600000000001
what you know how that goes with me I go

661.16 --> 663.56
in all

673.36 --> 678.88
directions of also I've still been

675.6 --> 682.0790000000001
pondering upon like how were these

678.88 --> 685.6
ancient buildings being built because

682.079 --> 689.76
that is kind of a puzzle to

685.6 --> 692.6800000000001
me they have to have been built somehow

689.76 --> 695.6
and I've entertain like the mystery that

692.68 --> 699.8389999999999
they POS has made me entertain that

695.6 --> 704.0400000000001
maybe even there are supernal elements

699.839 --> 707.36
involved but I mean I can't just rest my

704.04 --> 707.36
case at

708.959 --> 714.16
that I have to try to figure out like

711.76 --> 717.76
could they have just been regularly

714.16 --> 720.76
built how what does that

717.76 --> 724.519
mean and think think that the people

720.76 --> 727.8
that would have built them probably were

724.519 --> 731.16
like dedicated like people that would

727.8 --> 734.56
have been dedicated their entire lives

731.16 --> 734.56
to building like one

736.44 --> 741.839
building because it might just have

738.8 --> 744.4399999999999
taken a very long time for those things

741.839 --> 749.0400000000001
to be built even with good

744.44 --> 749.0400000000001
technology of those times

752.519 --> 757.279
so maybe a lot of these buildings were

754.68 --> 760.279
like life projects of certain

757.279 --> 760.279
people

760.48 --> 764.9200000000001
and we just don't know about

767.6 --> 773.76
it I mean I I have I'm actually having

771.72 --> 777.88
some form of Doubt like whether they

773.76 --> 780.399
were act whether these people these

777.88 --> 782.8389999999999
people

780.399 --> 785.839
or the civilization or however you see

782.839 --> 788.44
it like what if they were even like

785.839 --> 792.519
completely

788.44 --> 796.44
human or if they were like humans with

792.519 --> 800.04
psionic power like with more tendency to

796.44 --> 800.0400000000001
telepathy something like that

801.04 --> 808.519
or a people that were more like elves

805.92 --> 810.4799999999999
from The Lord of the Rings and not with

808.519 --> 812.88
ears and everything or maybe they were

810.48 --> 815.8000000000001
who knows

812.88 --> 817.6
but what makes the elf so distinct in

815.8 --> 820.079
Lord of the Rings is that well they're

817.6 --> 822.6800000000001
supposedly Immortal but they're also

820.079 --> 826.519
just very they have like this magical

822.68 --> 831.7589999999999
Spirit to them and they can do magic

826.519 --> 833.759
some of them and it's just yeah the

831.759 --> 837.32
elves

833.759 --> 840.399
artistic and they take their

837.32 --> 842.8000000000001
time so could

840.399 --> 845.839
those buildings have been built by elves

842.8 --> 849.7589999999999
is basically what I'm

845.839 --> 852.44
saying and then were were they hunted

849.759 --> 852.44
down

854.639 --> 860.0790000000001
afterward by I don't know the free I'm

857.279 --> 863.24
just going to go generic the Freemasons

860.079 --> 866.8
did it or something I don't know

863.24 --> 869.639
but or maybe the

866.8 --> 873.92
Vatican but maybe they were like a

869.639 --> 873.92
really special people that were just

873.959 --> 876.959
like

879.56 --> 886.7199999999999
psionic and pure pure it could probably

883.8 --> 890.279
be something like that like they were

886.72 --> 894.0
pure-hearted enough to to build all this

890.279 --> 896.16
but maybe like elves because that's part

894.0 --> 899.32
like there is something there right with

896.16 --> 901.6
the toim connection and the elves

899.32 --> 904.519
because even there like toen describes

901.6 --> 908.12
it as a people that

904.519 --> 910.68
were they live forever but they can like

908.12 --> 914.0
if they're properly demoralized like

910.68 --> 918.079
they lose the will to

914.0 --> 920.079
live maybe it's like that maybe the

918.079 --> 923.3599999999999
darkness through these dark

920.079 --> 926.4799999999999
organizations the devil arguably through

923.36 --> 928.6
them and they would probably have like

926.48 --> 930.279
even claimed to have been the devil

928.6 --> 933.8000000000001
Maybe they still

930.279 --> 936.6
do would

933.8 --> 938.639
definitely make sense in according in

936.6 --> 941.8000000000001
accordance to certain experiences I've

938.639 --> 944.04
had with very suspicious individuals in

941.8 --> 944.04
the

948.959 --> 953.04
past maybe they went after

954.6 --> 959.8000000000001
them and their magnificent abilities

958.24 --> 961.36
basically

959.8 --> 965.16
died with them

961.36 --> 969.399
then so it's like yeah a person like

965.16 --> 971.92
that could spent their lives building

969.399 --> 974.319
such a

971.92 --> 977.5999999999999
monument but the conditions would have

974.319 --> 977.5999999999999
had to be right for

977.959 --> 986.319
them like in this mind

982.04 --> 988.36
controlling Darkness pushing world like

986.319 --> 991.36
they would probably never be able to do

988.36 --> 994.399
anything like that because they get too

991.36 --> 998.48
haunted by everything it would distract

994.399 --> 1002.36
them too much I mean these buildings do

998.48 --> 1005.759
really seem like they're like part of

1002.36 --> 1005.759
Heaven in a

1009.44 --> 1016.5600000000001
way so it would have really required

1012.8 --> 1020.639
these social circumstances these

1016.56 --> 1023.079
conditions for the

1020.639 --> 1027.52
for the realm for the society in order

1023.079 --> 1030.48
for those people to be able to build

1027.52 --> 1033.8799999999999
that and so I'd say like in the world

1030.48 --> 1036.199
the way it is right now like even if a

1033.88 --> 1041.16
person like that would

1036.199 --> 1041.16
exist like they wouldn't be able to do

1043.48 --> 1050.84
that like all the darkness would just

1046.12 --> 1050.84
jump on it like flies on our [ __ ]

1051.24 --> 1057.52
and just make it impossible I mean it's

1054.96 --> 1059.4
like a life's work and if like all these

1057.52 --> 1062.24
people are going to try to obstruct you

1059.4 --> 1066.76
or manipulate you all the time

1062.24 --> 1066.76
and like it'll never happen

1068.84 --> 1077.12
then right so you could even argue like

1072.799 --> 1077.12
presupposed if there's some kind of like

1077.559 --> 1084.1589999999999
elves that build these extreme buildings

1081.72 --> 1088.039
they might still even be around but they

1084.159 --> 1091.159
wouldn't be able to do it because of

1088.039 --> 1093.36
the social spiritual circumstances in

1091.159 --> 1093.3600000000001
the

1095.799 --> 1100.52
world right so yeah I guess that

1100.6 --> 1106.12
that's that's kind of what my uh what my

1104.0 --> 1108.24
spirit I wouldn't even say my mind but

1106.12 --> 1110.76
my spirit is like put together of all

1108.24 --> 1110.76
this

1112.919 --> 1117.24
and it's not the first time I've said it

1114.64 --> 1121.2
like were they even humans

1117.24 --> 1123.679
right they probably were

1121.2 --> 1126.3600000000001
genetically or are if they're still

1123.679 --> 1129.4
around

1126.36 --> 1131.799
but they

1129.4 --> 1134.2800000000002
just their Spirit would just be

1131.799 --> 1136.84
different and what they can do would be

1134.28 --> 1138.9189999999999
different but they would basically be

1136.84 --> 1142.24
humans and you would be able to Pro

1138.919 --> 1142.24
grade with them and everything

1146.159 --> 1152.679
and so you could potentially maybe even

1149.919 --> 1155.64
compare it to like numenorians in Lord

1152.679 --> 1160.6000000000001
of the Rings which are like high

1155.64 --> 1163.44
humans that it's more comparable to

1160.6 --> 1167.52
that not

1163.44 --> 1170.3600000000001
elves just all these perspectives on it

1167.52 --> 1172.96
like these buildings are

1170.36 --> 1175.32
there they have to have been built

1172.96 --> 1177.799
somehow by

1175.32 --> 1180.6399999999999
somebody and you have to be realistic

1177.799 --> 1182.24
about how the world is and what always

1180.64 --> 1185.1200000000001
keeps

1182.24 --> 1187.96
happening like what are the

1185.12 --> 1192.36
circumstances required for such things

1187.96 --> 1198.48
to be able to be built in yeah in such

1192.36 --> 1201.8799999999999
am Mount spread over the world so wide I

1198.48 --> 1204.48
mean like all over the world these types

1201.88 --> 1207.3200000000002
of buildings

1204.48 --> 1209.24
exist so there must have been a period

1207.32 --> 1213.28
in

1209.24 --> 1215.72
which there was the opportunity to do

1213.28 --> 1217.559
that somehow the like the spiritual

1215.72 --> 1221.799
chemistry the circumstance the

1217.559 --> 1221.799
peacefulness the the energy

1223.72 --> 1229.679
available for a

1226.44 --> 1232.0800000000002
certain group of people that are good in

1229.679 --> 1236.0
nature Architects Master

1232.08 --> 1239.36
Architects perhaps

1236.0 --> 1242.76
probably to yeah to actually spend their

1239.36 --> 1246.12
entire lives like a hundred years or

1242.76 --> 1247.4
something just designing and building

1246.12 --> 1251.32
such a

1247.4 --> 1253.52
thing probably simultaneously everywhere

1251.32 --> 1256.24
like all of them would just spent that

1253.52 --> 1256.24
time doing

1257.2 --> 1262.919
that and people people would have left

1260.64 --> 1262.919
them

1267.36 --> 1276.36
alone maybe they would leave them alone

1271.76 --> 1276.36
because yeah because of what like were

1280.76 --> 1287.08
they what was even how would even the

1283.6 --> 1290.7199999999998
religions of the time we working like

1287.08 --> 1293.32
was God like much closer to those people

1290.72 --> 1295.72
back then to the point where it's not

1293.32 --> 1299.6
just like distant praying

1295.72 --> 1301.919
but that people would see God in their

1299.6 --> 1307.6
dreams all the time for example and that

1301.919 --> 1310.159
he would like point a point

1307.6 --> 1313.8799999999999
tasks I just like now it's getting

1310.159 --> 1313.88
really wild speculation

1314.72 --> 1320.159
like I mean people do spiritual things

1317.919 --> 1322.72
but what if there was a time where that

1320.159 --> 1327.2
all worked much

1322.72 --> 1330.0
more clear and pronounced and instead of

1327.2 --> 1333.279
like you're just like working with it

1330.0 --> 1336.919
and just using your intuition and like

1333.279 --> 1341.039
every these spiritual perceptions would

1336.919 --> 1343.279
have been just a lot clearer

1341.039 --> 1346.2
circumstantially and that maybe there

1343.279 --> 1350.52
was just a a really a direct way to be

1346.2 --> 1350.52
in contact with God spiritually

1355.4 --> 1364.2
and then maybe one day God was like

1359.88 --> 1366.64
okay you're so close to me I'm like I

1364.2 --> 1368.0
will unleash this beauty upon the world

1366.64 --> 1371.039
and like

1368.0 --> 1374.44
imbue a ton of

1371.039 --> 1378.72
people with this inspiration to build

1374.44 --> 1378.72
these Monumental buildings

1380.44 --> 1387.2
like as a tribute to to me to Beauty to

1384.44 --> 1390.0
the designer himself I mean it isn't

1387.2 --> 1392.6000000000001
that aren't these buildings basically

1390.0 --> 1397.08
like a tribute to the designer I mean

1392.6 --> 1397.08
they're a glorious design they're a

1397.76 --> 1404.0
house like the

1400.52 --> 1406.9189999999999
realm is like a house and it's built by

1404.0 --> 1408.799
the designer and it's beautiful and

1406.919 --> 1412.0
magnificent

1408.799 --> 1415.4
so it's like a tribute to the designer

1412.0 --> 1419.159
so see I'm putting I'm putting it

1415.4 --> 1422.6000000000001
together I keep yeah it's almost turning

1419.159 --> 1425.4
into like a a fantasy

1422.6 --> 1427.799
style story or something I don't know

1425.4 --> 1430.88
but this is really

1427.799 --> 1434.52
serious if only somebody could just say

1430.88 --> 1440.44
hello in the chat after 25

1434.52 --> 1440.44
minutes yeah I'll just keep going

1445.76 --> 1449.44
all right so yeah in my view maybe there

1448.559 --> 1452.2
was a

1449.44 --> 1455.3200000000002
period in which men

1452.2 --> 1459.3600000000001
was men and

1455.32 --> 1459.36
women we closer to

1460.84 --> 1466.9599999999998
God God that we're still feeling this

1463.76 --> 1470.0
connection to and like shows us like

1466.96 --> 1472.2
what is wrong and right the logic

1470.0 --> 1472.2
the

1473.039 --> 1479.24
rules and we're getting oh so distracted

1476.0 --> 1483.2
away from these rules all the time

1479.24 --> 1485.52
by well gravers for

1483.2 --> 1487.279
example and people that are just

1485.52 --> 1491.1589999999999
addicted to the

1487.279 --> 1494.96
Earthly that don't believe in spiritual

1491.159 --> 1500.279
things yeah and perhaps then in that

1494.96 --> 1500.279
time there wasn't so much of that

1500.88 --> 1507.3600000000001
so it would have been like a time before

1503.64 --> 1510.5590000000002
let's say the devil started

1507.36 --> 1513.6
to get

1510.559 --> 1516.0
involved CU I think that actually in the

1513.6 --> 1519.559
period of the renissance as as we know

1516.0 --> 1522.72
at that time frame I think that in that

1519.559 --> 1525.72
time it's like the devil came

1522.72 --> 1525.72
down

1526.919 --> 1532.8400000000001
and sounds gross like imbued himself

1531.039 --> 1536.279
into a whole bunch of

1532.84 --> 1540.279
people to like I think that that

1536.279 --> 1540.279
happened like around the Renaissance

1543.2 --> 1549.3600000000001
time that like all these satanic Cults

1547.08 --> 1550.6789999999999
and all these satanic ideas suddenly

1549.36 --> 1553.9599999999998
came

1550.679 --> 1557.039
around I think that right before

1553.96 --> 1559.96
that was probably a period where God was

1557.039 --> 1562.72
very close to people like really

1559.96 --> 1564.72
close it would have it would have been a

1562.72 --> 1566.3600000000001
spiritual connection but there would

1564.72 --> 1570.159
have been like a much more direct

1566.36 --> 1574.12
communication perhaps and that in that

1570.159 --> 1577.5200000000002
time God had like inspired certain

1574.12 --> 1580.2399999999998
individuals a whole bunch of

1577.52 --> 1583.399
Architects to to build that and spent

1580.24 --> 1583.3990000000001
their entire lives do

1583.88 --> 1591.3200000000002
it as a tribute to the

1587.0 --> 1594.44
designer and to well to enrich the

1591.32 --> 1594.4399999999998
overall experience of

1595.2 --> 1601.1200000000001
humans and then the devil

1598.08 --> 1603.24
basically got perhaps got pissed off or

1601.12 --> 1605.1999999999998
whatever something happened a whole

1603.24 --> 1609.1200000000001
bunch of Darkness came

1605.2 --> 1614.919
forth in people and they

1609.12 --> 1614.9189999999999
started trying to tear down the old

1615.799 --> 1622.399
ways and take over

1618.919 --> 1622.3990000000001
and like really

1622.96 --> 1626.32
become mind

1626.559 --> 1631.279
controllers and rearrange history and

1629.0 --> 1633.559
everything and what we're now settled up

1631.279 --> 1636.96
with in our

1633.559 --> 1639.96
age right so yeah there's there's an

1636.96 --> 1639.96
idea

1662.88 --> 1667.72
all right I'll just start taking a bite

1665.36 --> 1672.12
out of my

1667.72 --> 1672.1200000000001
C we'll see if somebody shows

1677.12 --> 1680.12
up

1707.12 --> 1711.08
for for

1754.519 --> 1758.36
right for everybody not in the chat

1756.24 --> 1760.88
currently but

1758.36 --> 1763.76
listening live or afterward don't forget

1760.88 --> 1763.7600000000002
to Rogan it

1765.559 --> 1771.08
up give it a like for

1813.0 --> 1818.84
L okay I'm getting emails from debatable

1819.32 --> 1824.2
D who can't be in chat for some

1824.24 --> 1829.2
reason cuz she's like Shadow band it

1827.24 --> 1833.679
doesn't make any s like she's not

1829.2 --> 1833.679
blocked or in my band list

1865.039 --> 1869.96
wow oh the weather's really nice

1873.559 --> 1880.6
outside let's look at

1876.88 --> 1884.6000000000001
this look at how blue that

1880.6 --> 1884.6
is amazing

1895.88 --> 1898.88
for

1920.76 --> 1923.76
h

1932.4 --> 1935.63
[Music]

1976.919 --> 1979.8400000000001
wow

1982.96 --> 1987.679
wow with this kind of chat participation

1988.84 --> 1993.48
uh yeah my show is not going to be very

1993.559 --> 2000.76
long I hope you liked my

1996.279 --> 2003.24
story my idea about the origin of the

2000.76 --> 2003.24
amazing

2004.48 --> 2010.799
architecture still somewhat of a mystery

2008.96 --> 2014.519
but I'm trying to put it

2010.799 --> 2016.48
together and it goes all over the

2014.519 --> 2019.36
place it

2016.48 --> 2021.44
basically there's a dichotomy like

2019.36 --> 2025.4399999999998
whether they're

2021.44 --> 2028.0
there explicitly created by the darkness

2025.44 --> 2028.0
almost like

2028.24 --> 2032.679
a

2030.08 --> 2036.12
yeah I don't know whether their origin

2032.679 --> 2038.96
is truly dark in a way or if it is

2036.12 --> 2040.0
actually really light or maybe it's some

2038.96 --> 2042.8400000000001
weird

2040.0 --> 2044.639
combination I mean with the catacombs

2042.84 --> 2048.2
and all that and the bones I mean that

2044.639 --> 2051.0
does not really feel like oh yeah that's

2048.2 --> 2053.56
that's God no that just does feel kind

2051.0 --> 2055.72
of weird and like sort of necromantic

2053.56 --> 2058.72
but I

2055.72 --> 2058.72
mean

2058.879 --> 2064.1189999999997
bad I mean it's

2061.599 --> 2065.7200000000003
confusing it makes things confusing

2064.119 --> 2069.0
about

2065.72 --> 2072.1589999999997
it but it could be that the catacomb

2069.0 --> 2074.48
system that that's actually done

2072.159 --> 2075.96
afterward that it that that's what

2074.48 --> 2078.96
happened post

2075.96 --> 2078.96
corruption

2087.2 --> 2090.7999999999997
even don't really

2091.04 --> 2095.639
know but it does seem kind of bizarre

2093.44 --> 2098.359
like that God would Inspire this like

2095.639 --> 2100.76
amazing Beauty and then

2098.359 --> 2103.64
like oh yeah and just have the bunch of

2100.76 --> 2103.6400000000003
Bones of

2104.44 --> 2111.839
people like put into sculptures beneath

2107.4 --> 2116.2000000000003
it and that's going to like electrically

2111.839 --> 2118.92
Empower people who come in there like

2116.2 --> 2118.9199999999996
that's kind of

2120.92 --> 2127.76
weird but it doesn't seem like the the

2125.359 --> 2131.7599999999998
yeah the bones and all that are specific

2127.76 --> 2133.599
specifically part of architecture like

2131.76 --> 2136.76
so it does look like they could have

2133.599 --> 2136.76
been assembled

2137.52 --> 2143.839
afterward after the original building

2140.56 --> 2143.839
was finished

2183.96 --> 2189.079
okay well I think I'm probably going to

2186.56 --> 2191.44
round out in about 5 minutes from now if

2189.079 --> 2195.2000000000003
nobody says anything in my

2191.44 --> 2195.2000000000003
chat cuz this is

2196.0 --> 2201.0
ridiculous but don't worry I will be

2199.0 --> 2204.16
able to amuse

2201.0 --> 2206.24
myself any problem or stress so I could

2204.16 --> 2208.359
just go outside it's really nice weather

2206.24 --> 2211.7999999999997
I can probably score some Illuminati

2208.359 --> 2211.7999999999997
cassant for the coming

2212.96 --> 2218.2400000000002
days and then we'll try again tomorrow

2222.599 --> 2226.1600000000003
how about that

2262.0 --> 2267.28
okay well my show got two Rens ups at

2264.599 --> 2267.28
least that's

2268.24 --> 2271.56
something thank

2271.8 --> 2278.0
you one of them is probably debatable D

2274.68 --> 2281.1189999999997
who is incapable of entering the chat

2278.0 --> 2285.52
because they're being Shadow Bann and

2281.119 --> 2285.52
there's nothing I can do about it

2310.4 --> 2317.28
oh got a really good comment from

2313.88 --> 2318.839
Mojo I show yesterday yeah I I remember

2317.28 --> 2322.7200000000003
now I was talking

2318.839 --> 2325.4
about being a wizard why I say that what

2322.72 --> 2328.1189999999997
that actually is how how close it really

2325.4 --> 2331.2000000000003
is to like being a priest that's in the

2328.119 --> 2331.2000000000003
last part of my show

2332.16 --> 2337.2799999999997
yesterday cuz the show was pretty good

2334.64 --> 2340.0
yesterday but like in that last hour I

2337.28 --> 2341.8390000000004
had I had a second coffee and then I had

2340.0 --> 2346.359
like this second wind

2341.839 --> 2346.359
and got very inspired

2413.599 --> 2422.96
wow getting a lot of really triggered

2416.88 --> 2422.96
comments from Richard G out there

2432.359 --> 2439.2

thanks for finally joining I thought it

2457.64 --> 2464.7599999999998
was going to

2459.28 --> 2464.76
be just me sitting in front of like zero

2466.48 --> 2471.72
people I actually had just decided like

2469.599 --> 2475.4
you know what if nobody shows up I'm

2471.72 --> 2477.9199999999996
just going to talk to like an empty chat

2475.4 --> 2481.44
for at least two hours I had kind of

2477.92 --> 2481.44
decided that I was going to do that

2485.88 --> 2491.4
anyway but I me

2487.96 --> 2494.4
yeah isn't this just ridiculous I

2491.4 --> 2496.92
got a little tiny little Channel and

2494.4 --> 2501.2000000000003
there's just people that get Shadow

2496.92 --> 2501.2000000000003
banned like they're not even

2502.319 --> 2510.04
like given a warning or anything or

2506.44 --> 2510.4900000000002
like some kind of thing with YouTube

2510.04 --> 2512.0

appear and they don't they don't say

2523.44 --> 2529.48
anything and it's not in my

2526.16 --> 2532.72
lists they just

2529.48 --> 2536.359
yeah like debatable D yeah I've had like

2532.72 --> 2538.52
some rockus with her got a bit agitated

2536.359 --> 2540.92
ban her then unband her and then it's

2538.52 --> 2540.92
like

2541.44 --> 2549.119
hey she just can't

2544.16 --> 2549.1189999999997
comment just it's just gone

2551.07 --> 2554.2490000000003
[Music]

2571.599 --> 2578.3590000000004
did you block my comments or Vis it

2575.319 --> 2582.0
YouTube uh well you had some uh comments

2578.359 --> 2582.0
that just were held back by

2590.16 --> 2598.68
YouTube but that's that's what YouTube

2594.2 --> 2600.3999999999996
does like I have to then go into YouTube

2598.68 --> 2604.24
studio and

2600.4 --> 2605.48
then actively approve those comments or

2604.24 --> 2609.1189999999997
they don't

2605.48 --> 2609.119
appear hey Mike

2632.48 --> 2639.04
nich

2634.2 --> 2639.04
agent June 10th oh you're

2644.319 --> 2653.0
fake yeah people with wrenches have had

2648.04 --> 2653.0
just sentences not show up it's really

2653.2 --> 2657.96
strange I mean isn't it like it's not

2657.04 --> 2660.48
it's

2657.96 --> 2663.7200000000003
like I don't get

2660.48 --> 2667.2
censored even though I do like

2663.72 --> 2668.8799999999997
really I can go very far and some

2667.2 --> 2671.9199999999996
sometimes I'm surprised that I'm not

2668.88 --> 2674.319
being like cracked down upon by YouTube

2671.92 --> 2676.119
get more strikes effectively or whatever

2674.319 --> 2677.2
but for some reason that doesn't really

2676.119 --> 2680.04
happen that

2677.2 --> 2683.839
much only in times when I've really gone

2680.04 --> 2683.839
completely foaming at the mouth

2684.92 --> 2691.359
ballistic because somehow when it's

2687.4 --> 2694.8
personal then like I might get a video

2691.359 --> 2698.2
taken down or whatever strike or

2694.8 --> 2702.119
something but other like people people

2698.2 --> 2704.8799999999997
that come over here and communicate with

2702.119 --> 2709.079
me they are getting censored I mean

2704.88 --> 2709.079
that's very strange

2729.16 --> 2735.16
this happens to you what Mike what are

2731.2 --> 2735.16
you talking about what happens to

2739.119 --> 2744.4
you that your comments don't show up

2760.359 --> 2763.44
you can't make a

2764.4 --> 2771.28
comment yeah that's very strange I mean

2766.88 --> 2771.28
I've never had you blocked

2771.48 --> 2777.839
ever like because we never like ran into

2774.839 --> 2779.96
like an argument of some kind we never

2777.839 --> 2782.44
bumped heads and I mean I do bump heads

2779.96 --> 2786.04
with some people sometimes I mean I've

2782.44 --> 2788.52
bumped heads with clutch GL of times but

2786.04 --> 2790.72
like we just know that about one another

2788.52 --> 2793.48
now and we're like careful with that

2790.72 --> 2793.48
which I really

2801.0 --> 2807.0
appreciate because it's like peace on

2804.92 --> 2809.0
another level on a more instinctive

2807.0 --> 2814.319
level like you're

2809.0 --> 2817.04
both two bucks like they males in the

2814.319 --> 2819.48
woods and like you you have like this

2817.04 --> 2821.44
weird intuitive competitive feeling like

2819.48 --> 2824.2
you want to bash heads but at the same

2821.44 --> 2826.2400000000002
time you know like yeah but you don't

2824.2 --> 2830.0789999999997
need to do

2826.24 --> 2833.72
that so that we can be both

2830.079 --> 2836.319
friends and trustees but at the same

2833.72 --> 2838.7599999999998
time also like get on each other's

2836.319 --> 2841.64
nerves for some reason but then still

2838.76 --> 2844.1600000000003
maintain peace and I mean that's

2841.64 --> 2846.04
important especially if you want to be

2844.16 --> 2847.7599999999998
friends with somebody like me because

2846.04 --> 2850.04
that kind of thing just tends to happen

2847.76 --> 2850.0400000000004
I'm

2851.119 --> 2857.319
just I get on people's nerves I don't

2854.2 --> 2857.319
know why

2857.559 --> 2863.6800000000003
it's I think it's like part of just my

2860.96 --> 2865.7200000000003
operating procedure system like this is

2863.68 --> 2868.1189999999997
like what I learned to do at a very

2865.72 --> 2870.7599999999998
young age is

2868.119 --> 2872.7200000000003
like to attain certain forms of

2870.76 --> 2875.7200000000003
information you got to get on people's

2872.72 --> 2875.72
nerves

2877.48 --> 2882.52
actually when you say it like that that

2879.119 --> 2882.52
sounds incredibly

2882.88 --> 2892.48
jewy but I mean I think that that just

2887.92 --> 2892.48
happened that that's how I work

2895.359 --> 2901.0
anyway what other day you went back for

2898.119 --> 2903.319
a coffee and your comments just wouldn't

2901.0 --> 2908.76
show

2903.319 --> 2908.7599999999998
up huh that is so weird

2911.359 --> 2917.4
we so it's it's

2914.72 --> 2919.5589999999997
even like kind of random when it happens

2917.4 --> 2923.319
you're saying that I mean that is just

2919.559 --> 2923.3190000000004
weird man like what the hell does

2923.839 --> 2926.839
that

2927.04 --> 2932.52
like why the arbitrary nature of it I

2930.559 --> 2934.48
mean that makes even less sense if it

2932.52 --> 2936.48
was just like everything just gets

2934.48 --> 2937.559
blocked out it's like an error or

2936.48 --> 2939.319
something

2937.559 --> 2941.6800000000003
but I mean

2939.319 --> 2946.0
random oh the comments just don't show

2941.68 --> 2946.0
up for this individual like

2949.559 --> 2954.28
what or maybe it's not even just my

2952.359 --> 2956.52
channel maybe this is just starting to

2954.28 --> 2960.28
happen with all kinds of YouTube live

2956.52 --> 2962.92
streams has anybody ever taken notice of

2960.28 --> 2967.1600000000003
this sort of thing happening on other

2962.92 --> 2967.16
channels on YouTube

2968.319 --> 2974.04
cuz I'm certainly noticing this kind of

2970.52 --> 2976.599
thing on my channel tons and I mean this

2974.04 --> 2979.92
sort of thing has been going on for like

2976.599 --> 2979.92
at least two years

2980.559 --> 2985.88
straight probably

2982.76 --> 2989.0400000000004
more probably like five years back it's

2985.88 --> 2990.88
just that then I just was too puzzled

2989.04 --> 2993.839
didn't really know like what was going

2990.88 --> 2996.799
on so I never really put it all together

2993.839 --> 2999.0789999999997
but I mean two years ago that like this

2996.799 --> 3000.88
sort of thing was really noticeable the

2999.079 --> 3004.28
shadow

3000.88 --> 3007.48
Bing like especially with the lumpy gas

3004.28 --> 3010.119
in the vacuum that was so

3007.48 --> 3013.88
strange like I had a shadow B like I

3010.119 --> 3013.88
could not see his

3014.0 --> 3019.28
messages like I had him blocked but I

3016.559 --> 3019.28
didn't have him

3021.04 --> 3026.319
blocked it's so weird

3031.96 --> 3036.7200000000003
anyway oh you have it with q and Fe

3034.4 --> 3039.7200000000003
chats as

3036.72 --> 3039.72
well

3041.28 --> 3049.0
H didn't you put in place a list of

3045.079 --> 3049.0
locked words a few years ago

3051.96 --> 3058.4
yeah but those words I mean that's not

3055.16 --> 3061.5989999999997
something that you're

3058.4 --> 3065.1600000000003
you're not going to be using those

3061.599 --> 3067.7200000000003
words I mean it's most mostly like troll

3065.16 --> 3067.72
related

3070.52 --> 3077.0
words and words like pedo and I mean if

3074.4 --> 3078.1600000000003
you're going to use yeah that in a in a

3077.0 --> 3081.319
sentence

3078.16 --> 3084.48
then yeah that's not going to show up

3081.319 --> 3087.4
but I mean you probably won't talk about

3084.48 --> 3089.799
that because you know that I really

3087.4 --> 3093.599
don't want people to talk like that and

3089.799 --> 3093.599
I don't like to bring up that kind of

3093.839 --> 3097.839
subject so

3146.04 --> 3149.64
okay interest

3192.76 --> 3195.76
h

3210.92 --> 3214.079
bro what is

3228.4 --> 3231.4
that

3232.44 --> 3237.96
what okay now search bar is just

3247.0 --> 3252.96
yeah medical info nothing showed up oh

3250.76 --> 3252.96
that

3259.079 --> 3266.96
sucks yeah that didn't even show up in

3261.92 --> 3268.4
like the need to approve list G

3266.96 --> 3270.96
by the way I don't know why you're

3268.4 --> 3274.599
appearing with that sock account of

3270.96 --> 3277.839
yours that you made yesterday I mean

3274.599 --> 3277.839
your main account isn't

3278.359 --> 3284.52
blocked I mean yeah I did ban you for a

3282.079 --> 3286.8390000000004
bit but I did unban you again so I don't

3284.52 --> 3292.04
know why you're like coming here with

3286.839 --> 3292.04
your sock account like that that's weird

3309.079 --> 3312.3590000000004
and it's kind of weird that you're just

3310.559 --> 3317.25
showing up with a socker account in the

3312.359 --> 3320.34
first place you just assumed well

3317.25 --> 3320.34
[Music]

3323.16 --> 3329.2799999999997
yeah do I need to say more for

3362.64 --> 3367.24
[Music]

3364.24 --> 3367.24
that

3403.76 --> 3406.76
hey

3411.0 --> 3415.0
right okay

3419.119 --> 3427.039
man that reg regular C just doesn't feel

3422.64 --> 3427.0389999999998
like it really hit the

3430.2 --> 3438.52
spot I could have another one cuz I had

3433.599 --> 3438.52
two of them but I don't know

3468.88 --> 3474.4
B yeah that's fine Richie G I mean

3478.319 --> 3483.4
I wanted to at least like give you a

3480.319 --> 3486.0
chance to like explain

3483.4 --> 3489.1600000000003
yourself I mean it's not like just say

3486.0 --> 3491.559
like oh Jesus is aedo like clear I mean

3489.16 --> 3493.44
yeah clear can [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out of

3491.559 --> 3497.559
here like I don't really want to see him

3493.44 --> 3499.92
again that's just so

3497.559 --> 3503.88
repulsive like

3499.92 --> 3506.28
that's but I mean yeah you just got

3503.88 --> 3508.599
really weird

3506.28 --> 3512.96
and pissed off for me saying you're an

3508.599 --> 3515.76
intellectual coward and that's it I

3512.96 --> 3520.319
mean not just going to like

3515.76 --> 3520.3190000000004
completely seal you off for

3527.48 --> 3533.68
that but it certainly has changed my

3530.52 --> 3535.75
perspective on you as an individual and

3533.68 --> 3536.96
participant so

3535.75 --> 3539.72
[Music]

3536.96 --> 3539.7200000000003
it is what it

3559.559 --> 3565.739
is but yeah I mean

3562.6 --> 3565.739
[Music]

3570.88 --> 3575.48
you can leave whatever you like but I

3572.76 --> 3577.7200000000003
mean you are getting reclassified as a

3575.48 --> 3578.96
special boy earther for the statements

3577.72 --> 3582.64
that you might

3578.96 --> 3582.64
made that's what that

3586.2 --> 3593.0789999999997
is and maybe it's just a phase that

3589.48 --> 3593.079
you're going through

3608.119 --> 3613.76
I mean like every flat earther in a way

3611.119 --> 3616.88
gets sick of just

3613.76 --> 3620.5200000000004
dealing with the standard spiritually

3616.88 --> 3627.839
allergic response of bards

3620.52 --> 3630.44
to the statement of fact Earth is flat

3627.839 --> 3633.48
people flat earthers can get sick of

3630.44 --> 3637.079
that like I get a little sick of

3633.48 --> 3639.88
it on the other

3637.079 --> 3643.3590000000004
hand I don't get sick of

3639.88 --> 3646.0
it that's why I'm still having it as

3643.359 --> 3648.5589999999997
part of a subject if I truly get sick of

3646.0 --> 3650.24
it then this wouldn't have been called

3648.559 --> 3654.92
The Flat Earth early bir show it would

3650.24 --> 3654.9199999999996
have just been called the early bir show

3656.4 --> 3659.839
and I would have never been part of the

3658.039 --> 3662.119
Flat Earth

3659.839 --> 3664.68
debates but yeah they're taking it a

3662.119 --> 3667.7200000000003
little far in that sense

3664.68 --> 3670.68
that not that that's wrong or

3667.72 --> 3673.24
intellectually dishonest or anything

3670.68 --> 3678.839
it's just

3673.24 --> 3678.839
that I don't like to sit on that

3681.52 --> 3687.2
level but I do kind of like want to

3684.319 --> 3690.7599999999998
create this General culture of like yeah

3687.2 --> 3692.8799999999997
we're just all like we know the Earth is

3690.76 --> 3696.3190000000004
flat

3692.88 --> 3699.319
and that's just how it is

3696.319 --> 3700.7599999999998
here like not like all the other places

3699.319 --> 3702.2799999999997
where like

3700.76 --> 3705.92
oh

3702.28 --> 3709.88
oh but yeah it's as stupid as a flat

3705.92 --> 3712.44
earth like that in all like infow War

3709.88 --> 3717.039
still does that it's really

3712.44 --> 3719.88
tedious and they still do it despite

3717.039 --> 3722.7200000000003
like some of their own crew are actually

3719.88 --> 3725.96
flat earst and they still do

3722.72 --> 3729.16
that cuz it's just it's I've realized

3725.96 --> 3732.7200000000003
that it's just kind of part of balard

3729.16 --> 3735.3999999999996
culture to diss at flat

3732.72 --> 3737.16
earthers and since there's Bard culture

3735.4 --> 3739.079
out there like yeah they are going to

3737.16 --> 3741.0
diss at flat earthers even when flat

3739.079 --> 3743.6400000000003
earthers are probably some of their best

3741.0 --> 3745.88
friends and then they'll still do that

3743.64 --> 3749.2
CU you have to shame it's like a cult

3745.88 --> 3752.76
Cal thing you're a Bart you have to

3749.2 --> 3752.7599999999998
shame the Flat

3755.559 --> 3762.96
Earth it's like a defensive mechanism to

3759.48 --> 3766.2400000000002
keep yourself at a distance from it and

3762.96 --> 3767.799
thereby preventing the realization that

3766.24 --> 3771.4799999999996
the

3767.799 --> 3774.52
entire framework of your

3771.48 --> 3776.359
ideas of how everything is the world

3774.52 --> 3778.2
that that's all [ __ ]

3776.359 --> 3781.119
you have to shame them to keep it at a

3778.2 --> 3785.4399999999996
distance to prevent it from sinking

3781.119 --> 3788.119
in and it and they all do it and here

3785.44 --> 3791.359
you don't do it here it's the other way

3788.119 --> 3794.2400000000002
around here it's like no no no we know

3791.359 --> 3796.48
the Earth is flat but we get it if

3794.24 --> 3799.9599999999996
you're kind of a Ballard I

3796.48 --> 3803.119
mean it's very tough

3799.96 --> 3805.799
to to

3803.119 --> 3808.0
face that the dream might not be

3805.799 --> 3810.72
literally

3808.0 --> 3812.359
real but I mean as soon as you do face

3810.72 --> 3814.359
it then at first it's going to be

3812.359 --> 3817.0789999999997
dispelled and you're going to feel like

3814.359 --> 3819.48
naked or empty it's going to Terri be

3817.079 --> 3823.44
terrible on you but then later you

3819.48 --> 3825.2400000000002
realize like yeah but it doesn't matter

3823.44 --> 3829.0
that it's not

3825.24 --> 3830.319
real it's real to people and it's real

3829.0 --> 3832.839
it's a real

3830.319 --> 3834.88
dream and the dream's going to continue

3832.839 --> 3837.72
anyway like whether it's real or not

3834.88 --> 3840.319
it's going to it's not going to go away

3837.72 --> 3845.0389999999998
yeah that's where I'm at that's like

3840.319 --> 3845.0389999999998
that's where Ballwin comes in it's like

3846.16 --> 3851.279
yeah it's like you know it's real

3849.319 --> 3854.96
because it's proven

3851.279 --> 3857.96
fake it's like yeah it doesn't matter

3854.96 --> 3861.76
whether it is absolutely certainly not

3857.96 --> 3864.48
real we can think of it as real and that

3861.76 --> 3867.48
works and like everybody then that

3864.48 --> 3869.44
thinks of it as real like tends to agree

3867.48 --> 3871.52
on these things and it makes you feel

3869.44 --> 3874.88
really good about

3871.52 --> 3878.96
yourself makes you feel really

3874.88 --> 3882.2000000000003
smart even though it's all fake CU it's

3878.96 --> 3886.079
like it it provides a lot of dreaming

3882.2 --> 3889.16
room in that very specific way

3886.079 --> 3892.119
though I mean it's not very constructive

3889.16 --> 3895.44
really the globe dream is not actually

3892.119 --> 3899.2000000000003
constructive it's a good way to keep you

3895.44 --> 3901.799
busy and to keep you

3899.2 --> 3904.64
like mentally

3901.799 --> 3907.96
active but it does not really provide

3904.64 --> 3912.359
good food for the soul though or

3907.96 --> 3912.359
creativity it doesn't actually do

3917.4 --> 3922.76
that

3919.559 --> 3926.44
like you'll not find a lot of Super

3922.76 --> 3931.1600000000003
Creative people that are really

3926.44 --> 3933.2400000000002
like specifically into heliocentrism and

3931.16 --> 3936.44
astrophysics and all

3933.24 --> 3939.279
that like you have thinkers that are

3936.44 --> 3942.7200000000003
really into that but people that are

3939.279 --> 3945.119
actually physically create things or

3942.72 --> 3947.0389999999998
that are like Architects they're not

3945.119 --> 3949.039
really into

3947.039 --> 3952.279
it

3949.039 --> 3954.279
like I have I don't really know any

3952.279 --> 3958.4
people out there there might be

3954.279 --> 3962.559
some people that are like really

3958.4 --> 3966.799
Architects and that are into

3962.559 --> 3966.799
astrophysics it's usually one or the

3967.72 --> 3973.839
other right so I'm like yeah it's the

3972.599 --> 3976.52
Earth is

3973.839 --> 3979.48
flat but there's going to be people that

3976.52 --> 3981.559
are locked into the globe dream because

3979.48 --> 3983.2
this is the time in in which that's

3981.559 --> 3985.8390000000004
still being

3983.2 --> 3987.48
programmed it's still educated the

3985.839 --> 3991.0
incentive is

3987.48 --> 3993.119
everywhere for you to suspend your

3991.0 --> 3995.4
disbelief and think that the Earth is a

3993.119 --> 3998.2000000000003
globe in outer space and everything and

3995.4 --> 4002.48
everybody knows the story and it's like

3998.2 --> 4004.279
people are even proud or complimented

4002.48 --> 4006.76
for knowing the

4004.279 --> 4007.92
story but it's just a story because none

4006.76 --> 4012.92
of it is

4007.92 --> 4012.92
real but it doesn't matter that it's not

4014.079 --> 4021.92
real right and and I've experienced way

4018.0 --> 4024.039
like decades ago how people would make

4021.92 --> 4025.76
me realize like wait no the Earth is

4024.039 --> 4028.559
flat none of that is real and I'd be

4025.76 --> 4031.559
fascinated by just like oh but what is

4028.559 --> 4033.279
it then and what are the confines and

4031.559 --> 4034.7200000000003
like what do you actually know and what

4033.279 --> 4036.52
do you not know and there's all these

4034.72 --> 4037.7599999999998
Mysteries that are like really like

4036.52 --> 4040.48
right in front of you you want to

4037.76 --> 4043.7990000000004
explore them

4040.48 --> 4046.119
somehow and then I got isolated because

4043.799 --> 4048.559
I'm like the only one I knew that's even

4046.119 --> 4048.559
into

4048.599 --> 4054.52
that and then you just sink back you

4052.039 --> 4057.48
just sink back because you're just being

4054.52 --> 4061.0389999999998
exposed to the globe culture everywhere

4057.48 --> 4061.039
and then you just go back to that

4061.44 --> 4067.92
story but it would always leave me with

4064.68 --> 4072.16
like this longing of something and then

4067.92 --> 4072.16
I wouldn't know what but it made me feel

4073.52 --> 4079.48
unfulfilled until eventually 2015 when

4077.24 --> 4082.279
yeah it's really like no no no the Earth

4079.48 --> 4084.96
is really flat and now there's now you

4082.279 --> 4087.279
can keep yourself flat because there's

4084.96 --> 4089.0
other people that are openly flat

4087.279 --> 4092.44
earthers that you can

4089.0 --> 4095.52
just be like hey yeah Earth is flat

4092.44 --> 4099.759
right because before

4095.52 --> 4103.679
2015 I did not have anybody it was one

4099.759 --> 4106.159
freaking guy that I thought was a flat

4103.679 --> 4109.2390000000005
earther that had all this magical

4106.159 --> 4111.679
experiences with like including Dark

4109.239 --> 4115.678999999999
World Visions of seeing like Eric dubet

4111.679 --> 4119.4400000000005
videos and all that in 2012 I mean it's

4115.679 --> 4123.08
just astounding and by the way also Crow

4119.44 --> 4124.678999999999
Tri 7's Moon Ripple also then in 2012 I

4123.08 --> 4125.96
don't know if that's when he actually

4124.679 --> 4130.12
made the

4125.96 --> 4132.359
footage but magical experiences that I

4130.12 --> 4135.3189999999995
also shared this Dark World Vision stuff

4132.359 --> 4137.08
that I shared with that guy and then he

4135.319 --> 4139.64
got got confronted by this

4137.08 --> 4141.6
Freemason old man with all these medals

4139.64 --> 4143.719
on him and that threatened him like no

4141.6 --> 4145.64
you have to stop talking about Flat

4143.719 --> 4147.4
Earth or will take your child away

4145.64 --> 4151.319
because he just had a

4147.4 --> 4154.719
newborn and then he basically denounced

4151.319 --> 4159.279
it and stop talking about it so it's

4154.719 --> 4162.359
like literally up until 2015 I was

4159.279 --> 4167.319
just always freaking

4162.359 --> 4170.4800000000005
isolated with my flat Earth exploration

4167.319 --> 4173.799
always isolated and then

4170.48 --> 4176.5599999999995
yeah you then you feel in

4173.799 --> 4179.56
prison and there's nothing to develop it

4176.56 --> 4179.56
with

4200.4 --> 4208.5199999999995
stop it Moxy nobody jumped on him should

4204.679 --> 4211.28
be sham I was just pissed off and he got

4208.52 --> 4214.719
pissed off and people were supportive of

4211.28 --> 4216.239
me and that is that's nothing to be

4214.719 --> 4219.8
ashamed

4216.239 --> 4221.48
of I really needed that because I was

4219.8 --> 4224.2390000000005
getting the feeling like somebody's

4221.48 --> 4226.5199999999995
playing a game on me and betraying me

4224.239 --> 4228.48
and that tends to hurt right especially

4226.52 --> 4231.400000000001
when the freaking day before that

4228.48 --> 4234.36
clearly did what he

4231.4 --> 4238.08
did and I mean yeah

4234.36 --> 4240.44
no I'm very happy that people were

4238.08 --> 4242.64
directly behind my back because in that

4240.44 --> 4245.28
moment I really needed

4242.64 --> 4248.96
it and nobody should be ashamed of that

4245.28 --> 4250.759999999999
at all I really thank you cuz it's not

4248.96 --> 4252.8
about whether that was right it was

4250.76 --> 4255.04
about in that moment about that you were

4252.8 --> 4258.08
supporting me and I needed that I really

4255.04 --> 4261.08
think thank you for that right and the

4258.08 --> 4263.199
next day like that Situation's over and

4261.08 --> 4265.44
he's unbanned and there's nothing to be

4263.199 --> 4269.08
ashamed of

4265.44 --> 4271.879999999999
Moxy so don't you start to dictate on

4269.08 --> 4275.12
like moral values in my chat thank you

4271.88 --> 4275.12
very much

4297.08 --> 4300.679
is the water the surface of

4301.04 --> 4304.04
Earth

4306.199 --> 4311.44
yeah the oceans are also the surface of

4309.12 --> 4314.44
the Earth yeah I think that's kind of

4311.44 --> 4314.44
official

4327.04 --> 4331.92
stop assuming all the time no no is not

4329.6 --> 4334.400000000001
strange at all

4331.92 --> 4336.52
Moxy look it's not going to work if

4334.4 --> 4339.679
you're going to if you are going to be

4336.52 --> 4343.56
here in my chat like an ax troll

4339.679 --> 4347.4800000000005
basically that's not really over

4343.56 --> 4350.88
it allowed in my chat

4347.48 --> 4353.638999999999
yeah there is freaking trolls out there

4350.88 --> 4357.92
and they do have agents and they

4353.639 --> 4359.84
literally like had to kick tered out

4357.92 --> 4363.679
again with one of his socker accounts

4359.84 --> 4366.52
yeah so people jumping on other

4363.679 --> 4369.0
people stop assuming dude there's [ __ ]

4366.52 --> 4371.76
happening all the time here

4369.0 --> 4373.36
Moxy so it's not strange at all if

4371.76 --> 4376.04
people are getting

4373.36 --> 4377.759999999999
paranoid about somebody acting weird in

4376.04 --> 4381.56
my chat and if they're going to jump all

4377.76 --> 4381.56
over him that is completely

4389.84 --> 4393.84
understandable okay

4405.52 --> 4411.040000000001
so this is important question to help me

4408.0 --> 4414.8
settle things for me well I answered

4411.04 --> 4414.8
yeah the water

4415.36 --> 4420.28
surface the ocean surface that's Earth's

4418.719 --> 4423.4800000000005
surface

4420.28 --> 4427.0
too yeah that's why they say water level

4423.48 --> 4427.0
ocean level

4442.12 --> 4445.12
shut

4445.38 --> 4448.729
[Music]

4472.52 --> 4476.400000000001
what is getting treated like garbage

4478.84 --> 4486.439
[Music]

4486.8 --> 4492.08
here all right but I mean again and you

4490.04 --> 4494.32
should have paid attention to when this

4492.08 --> 4496.32
was being said Richard G but I mean

4494.32 --> 4500.28
whatever

4496.32 --> 4503.44
yeah Flat Earth is not about the

4500.28 --> 4505.639
Topography of the earth

4503.44 --> 4510.44
realm it's not

4505.639 --> 4513.719
about Hills and Valleys mountain

4510.44 --> 4513.719
peaks and

4514.159 --> 4521.599999999999
craters or the Mariana Trench

4518.28 --> 4525.36
right it's about the

4521.6 --> 4526.4800000000005
orientation the average

4525.36 --> 4529.639
the

4526.48 --> 4532.4
level and ocean level is like a

4529.639 --> 4532.400000000001
universal

4532.8 --> 4539.1
thing for a reason CU it's flat and

4536.44 --> 4542.228999999999
every part is like it's the same

4539.1 --> 4542.229
[Music]

4548.48 --> 4553.199
height it's the same orientation the

4551.0 --> 4556.92
same geometric

4553.199 --> 4556.919999999999
orientation it's flat

4557.239 --> 4564.32
every part

4559.08 --> 4567.719
of the level is parallel to every other

4564.32 --> 4567.719
part of the

4573.679 --> 4583.4
level now if you try to do navigation on

4578.719 --> 4586.0
land well on land The Horizon might be

4583.4 --> 4588.04
obstructed

4586.0 --> 4591.48
which is what you need the Horizon based

4588.04 --> 4593.12
on the level right that's Horizon is

4591.48 --> 4595.0
going to be a level on the ocean because

4593.12 --> 4598.599999999999
the ocean is

4595.0 --> 4600.679
level but yeah if you're on land and

4598.6 --> 4603.6
there might be hills and mountains then

4600.679 --> 4607.8
yeah you're going to have to use a plum

4603.6 --> 4611.320000000001
to get a 90° to that vertical and

4607.8 --> 4613.76
then then you can

4611.32 --> 4616.84
establish where the Horizon would be

4613.76 --> 4616.84
even though it might not be

4617.6 --> 4623.360000000001
inside right so yeah on the land you use

4620.88 --> 4623.36
another

4638.0 --> 4641.88
method low tide high tide yeah I'm sure

4640.96 --> 4646.84
of

4641.88 --> 4646.84
it yeah so different heights

4647.48 --> 4649.759999999999
could

4650.639 --> 4655.679
be but all parallel to one another

4661.08 --> 4667.239
though right so your objection is

4664.239 --> 4667.239
topographical

4669.08 --> 4676.08
again Shan G there's no point in arguing

4672.84 --> 4679.76
this this is a Bev

4676.08 --> 4681.96
I'm going to say it bevart type argument

4679.76 --> 4684.52
it's not an argument you're making an a

4681.96 --> 4686.92
topographical objection that's not what

4684.52 --> 4686.92
this is

4691.4 --> 4697.12
about

4693.84 --> 4700.12
what no Moxy I'm not going to check out

4697.12 --> 4700.12
mun

4708.639 --> 4714.4400000000005
your objection is not flat land or Flat

4711.199 --> 4714.44
Earth what what does that even

4724.0 --> 4729.199
mean you don't want to sound like Bev at

4726.8 --> 4731.52
all well okay well then you should like

4729.199 --> 4734.5199999999995
think about what you're saying now then

4731.52 --> 4734.52
shanji

4735.0 --> 4737.56
but that's

4740.88 --> 4745.08
good it's flat like a

4747.4 --> 4754.239
pancake well people say a lot of things

4750.52 --> 4755.96
and hey if they are presupposing that

4754.239 --> 4759.959999999999
the Flat Earth is a

4755.96 --> 4762.88
dis with this with Polaris at the center

4759.96 --> 4765.28
basically like that at the center above

4762.88 --> 4768.400000000001
then yeah then having that this

4765.28 --> 4770.4
projection reified into the literal

4768.4 --> 4772.638999999999
terrain yeah you're going to end up with

4770.4 --> 4778.0
a

4772.639 --> 4778.0
pancake okay and it's still like not

4779.56 --> 4784.92
topographical because Flat Earth

4781.92 --> 4789.08
argumentation is not topographical it

4784.92 --> 4791.96
never was and it's kind of silly to to

4789.08 --> 4794.04
think that but yeah if you're going to

4791.96 --> 4797.12
assume presuppose that the Earth is like

4794.04 --> 4799.199
a disc literally then you're going to

4797.12 --> 4802.239
claim it's a pancake or a pizza or

4799.199 --> 4805.12
whatever you could do that I mean you

4802.239 --> 4809.4
don't know if that's what it

4805.12 --> 4812.08
is right I have an alternative it's it's

4809.4 --> 4815.239
looping it's a rectangular looping

4812.08 --> 4817.8
somewhere something like that or

4815.239 --> 4821.08
irregular looping but the

4817.8 --> 4825.360000000001
yeah it doesn't really

4821.08 --> 4825.36
matter that much

4831.36 --> 4837.04
it you're going to have to just fill it

4833.92 --> 4841.32
in with the amount of knowledge that you

4837.04 --> 4844.239
do have and a lot about doing that

4841.32 --> 4848.08
is realizing that there's some things

4844.239 --> 4850.799999999999
you don't know and then not having your

4848.08 --> 4853.0
instincts like fill it in

4850.8 --> 4854.88
automatically like it has to be like

4853.0 --> 4859.6
this because otherwise nothing makes

4854.88 --> 4862.88
sense like how do you avoid that typical

4859.6 --> 4865.96
routine in your head when envisioning

4862.88 --> 4868.04
the realm because people just do that

4865.96 --> 4870.08
it's it's like a physicality assumption

4868.04 --> 4872.639
bias it's like oh we're seeing the sun

4870.08 --> 4874.44
it has to be an object so oh then it has

4872.639 --> 4876.719
to be a disc because otherwise nothing

4874.44 --> 4879.799999999999
makes sense it's like yeah that's

4876.719 --> 4883.08
physicality assumption bias that's

4879.8 --> 4886.92
forcing you into a very specific type of

4883.08 --> 4891.239
model but it does pres

4886.92 --> 4891.2390000000005
presuppose the orientation of the

4893.0 --> 4896.0
Equator

4899.4 --> 4905.0
right you think it may be like pack I I

4902.92 --> 4908.4
don't know why people keep calling it

4905.0 --> 4908.4
that shanji it's very

4910.88 --> 4915.92
tedious I mean you could just as well

4913.28 --> 4918.84
call it scroll or Earth I mean just call

4915.92 --> 4918.84
it a scroll

4928.159 --> 4934.36
then or call it like trainman station

4931.76 --> 4937.679
Earth or something I why freaking

4934.36 --> 4937.679
Pac-Man it's so

4937.84 --> 4942.719
tedious it's kind of Boomer is to call

4940.76 --> 4945.76
it that I

4942.719 --> 4948.159
mean I'd call it pack man Earth if I try

4945.76 --> 4949.4400000000005
to explain it to a boomer that's like

4948.159 --> 4954.879999999999
that missed the

4949.44 --> 4954.879999999999
entire modern computer age or something

4975.76 --> 4980.6
mad matter what the [ __ ] does that mean

4977.6 --> 4980.6
Moxy

5027.199 --> 5033.159
you're just a special boy arther yeah

5030.52 --> 5036.280000000001
well if you if you can't just be like

5033.159 --> 5039.36
yeah it's flat if you if you're finding

5036.28 --> 5042.199
yourself like I just can't call it flat

5039.36 --> 5044.92
I don't want to call it flat or I don't

5042.199 --> 5047.759999999999
think it's really completely flat or oh

5044.92 --> 5049.92
the Topography is not flat yeah if that

5047.76 --> 5053.0
is what is happening

5049.92 --> 5056.4
internally and it's obstructing you from

5053.0 --> 5060.239
just saying like no Earth is flat yeah

5056.4 --> 5065.48
you're a special boy earther or a devite

5060.239 --> 5065.48
if you will that's what that is

5074.49 --> 5080.0
[Music]

5077.6 --> 5085.2390000000005
is that an insult yeah it kind of is

5080.0 --> 5087.92
duper but it's also just a diagnose of a

5085.239 --> 5090.44
psychological condition it's not

5087.92 --> 5092.0
necessarily an insult but you could

5090.44 --> 5095.638999999999
think of it as an

5092.0 --> 5097.79
insult I mean to a flat Earth that is it

5095.639 --> 5100.939
is kind of like a sign of

5097.79 --> 5100.939
[Music]

5106.56 --> 5111.52
weakness but that's why I think special

5109.0 --> 5115.0
boy earther is like probably the best

5111.52 --> 5115.0
way to describe

5122.84 --> 5130.4400000000005
it no one buys the looping oh well I'm

5127.88 --> 5132.92
sorry I'm sorry that you're not buying

5130.44 --> 5135.04
it you don't have to buy it it's just

5132.92 --> 5139.639
some you can

5135.04 --> 5143.36
basically prove or disprove that it

5139.639 --> 5144.52
is so I'm not even saying like well it's

5143.36 --> 5146.799999999999
definitely

5144.52 --> 5149.679
looping I'm just saying there's a good

5146.8 --> 5149.679
chance that it is

5151.28 --> 5156.239
looping special Bo Looper

5157.0 --> 5163.0
no what the [ __ ] is that supposed to

5161.08 --> 5165.92
mean

5163.0 --> 5168.44
rman

5165.92 --> 5171.84
ban [ __ ]

5168.44 --> 5174.4
off there's nothing special boy about

5171.84 --> 5174.400000000001
thinking it's

5175.199 --> 5182.119
looping it's merely another spatial

5179.08 --> 5184.639
solution to the predicament that we may

5182.119 --> 5188.0
be in

5184.639 --> 5190.719
yeah and all you need to know is the

5188.0 --> 5194.159
orientation of the

5190.719 --> 5197.119
Equator you have to basically figure out

5194.159 --> 5201.0
the celestial map and how it relates to

5197.119 --> 5204.759999999999
the Earth and what like yeah what is the

5201.0 --> 5209.76
equator if it's a straight line if it

5204.76 --> 5212.119000000001
turns out to actually not be a ukian

5209.76 --> 5215.6
circle but a straight

5212.119 --> 5218.48
line yeah it's looping like there's

5215.6 --> 5221.2390000000005
literally no other way

5218.48 --> 5224.48
then that's what it is

5221.239 --> 5227.678999999999
then there's no other way doesn't matter

5224.48 --> 5232.119
whether you think that's special or

5227.679 --> 5235.52
whatever it's a logical consequence of a

5232.119 --> 5235.5199999999995
potential outcome of a

5239.639 --> 5245.679
measurement is special boy bad yeah

5254.52 --> 5259.040000000001
yeah because what does that signify

5256.56 --> 5260.88
special boy that signifies somebody who

5259.04 --> 5262.679
thinks they're either better than

5260.88 --> 5265.08
everybody else or they're too good for

5262.679 --> 5269.08
everybody

5265.08 --> 5269.08
else yeah

5280.4 --> 5287.199
it is a c certain psychological mindset

5284.159 --> 5289.36
that happens to some people when they

5287.199 --> 5291.678999999999
attain a lot of

5289.36 --> 5294.88
information and they suddenly think like

5291.679 --> 5299.679
oh well I know more so I'm better than

5294.88 --> 5302.88
everybody else or better than those

5299.679 --> 5305.719
people yeah that makes them feel like a

5302.88 --> 5309.36
special boy

5305.719 --> 5311.96
right just like oh we're the chosen ones

5309.36 --> 5314.159
we're the chosen people we're better

5311.96 --> 5317.04
than everybody else they're the special

5314.159 --> 5321.599999999999
boys that's where that kind of comes

5317.04 --> 5326.5199999999995
from from a certain ethnic and or

5321.6 --> 5326.52
religious group if you know what I mean

5327.21 --> 5334.3
[Music]

5352.08 --> 5356.48
you've been reclassified things should

5354.119 --> 5356.48
be

5357.6 --> 5364.2390000000005
okay not really I mean special boy

5360.52 --> 5365.88
earthers are annoying

5364.239 --> 5367.839999999999
right you might not be somebody who

5365.88 --> 5369.6
likes to hang around beev but that's

5367.84 --> 5372.4800000000005
basically kind of like what you've

5369.6 --> 5374.4400000000005
become then regy if that but it might be

5372.48 --> 5376.32
temporary who knows man maybe you're

5374.44 --> 5379.08
just like you just need to think about

5376.32 --> 5381.48
this for a while or something really

5379.08 --> 5385.48
hope so otherwise you'll probably start

5381.48 --> 5385.48
enjoying yourself over at Bev's

5386.56 --> 5391.76
shows and then you'll truly

5389.239 --> 5394.199
know like oh

5391.76 --> 5397.04
[ __ ] I don't know what happened but if

5394.199 --> 5397.04
turned into a

5397.32 --> 5403.5599999999995
bite oh well oh well right I don't know

5405.52 --> 5412.1990000000005
man never been to be's Channel ever well

5409.56 --> 5414.8
you might have missed your calling

5412.199 --> 5419.239
then what's wrong with Bev

5414.8 --> 5419.2390000000005
show don't don't even get me

5420.08 --> 5424.36
started it's tedious

5425.4 --> 5430.04
I mean he's basically the guy that

5427.44 --> 5435.119
invented being a flat earther without

5430.04 --> 5435.119
calling it flat that that's like his

5441.639 --> 5446.0
obsession I did a Scottish accent

5444.4 --> 5449.0
representing you no I wasn't

5446.0 --> 5452.159
representing you I was referencing

5449.0 --> 5454.119
Dell I think I don't know what the hell

5452.159 --> 5458.239
I was doing anymore oh wait no I was

5454.119 --> 5458.239
talking I was basic that was a Scottish

5458.76 --> 5465.639
pirate yeah when I'm talking like a

5461.96 --> 5469.119
pirate that's like Scottish or

5465.639 --> 5472.6
something so yeah that had nothing to do

5469.119 --> 5474.32
with you I'm not like trying to do

5472.6 --> 5478.52
people's voices I don't even know what

5474.32 --> 5478.5199999999995
your freaking voice is like

5481.88 --> 5484.999
[Music]

5489.76 --> 5494.2390000000005
yeah that's that's nice a virus you're

5492.36 --> 5495.9
okay with Beth that's

5494.239 --> 5498.969999999999
cool let's move

5495.9 --> 5498.969999999999
[Music]

5507.08 --> 5512.28
on B has one topic I can't talk about

5510.159 --> 5515.839999999999
anything

5512.28 --> 5515.84
else oh God

5515.88 --> 5519.88
well then then things are much worse

5517.76 --> 5521.639
than I even thought shanji I mean if

5519.88 --> 5525.159000000001
that's literally the only thing he can

5521.639 --> 5525.159000000001
talk about then it's like

5527.159 --> 5531.799999999999
terrible he called you a French

5529.56 --> 5535.320000000001
something no I never call people a

5531.8 --> 5541.56
French something I just call them French

5535.32 --> 5541.5599999999995
like that's a designation by itself Moxy

5544.04 --> 5550.119
you made fun of my French heritage you

5546.32 --> 5554.4
bet you bet I'll do

5550.119 --> 5557.239
that yeah it's my good right as a Dutch

5554.4 --> 5560.638999999999
born citizen to make fun of your French

5557.239 --> 5563.919999999999
heritage and every French person's

5560.639 --> 5566.88
Heritage yeah it's like one of my first

5563.92 --> 5570.56
personal jokes is like I love France

5566.88 --> 5573.0
it's just the French you know yeah

5570.56 --> 5575.84
that's nobody's going to take that away

5573.0 --> 5575.84
from me

5577.119 --> 5580.4
okay that's

5581.679 --> 5586.2390000000005
mine and I mean just look at

5586.4 --> 5593.44
maon do I need to say anything else

5589.84 --> 5593.4400000000005
sorry I'll stop

5593.52 --> 5600.84
now thanks for French fries yeah yeah

5596.44 --> 5605.159
sure I'm not dude it's a

5600.84 --> 5607.159000000001
joke it's it's like that's like a joke

5605.159 --> 5609.679
from an era that's kind of like

5607.159 --> 5611.839999999999
nationalist minded like the French would

5609.679 --> 5614.92
probably say that about the Dutch too if

5611.84 --> 5618.32
they but they don't really do that

5614.92 --> 5622.96
because they're just too cucky and

5618.32 --> 5622.96
liberal Here I Go Again

5637.48 --> 5643.879999999999
you do walk around the loaves of

5640.88 --> 5643.88
bread

5657.48 --> 5664.119
okay yeah I'm not saying that French

5660.48 --> 5667.839999999999
people are always useless

5664.119 --> 5669.839999999999
it's just I just remember more things

5667.84 --> 5672.28
about them that just kind of like are

5669.84 --> 5674.88
detriments to the French

5672.28 --> 5677.8
character but I know there's there has

5674.88 --> 5680.679
to be some serious F French Legends out

5677.8 --> 5683.1990000000005
there otherwise how the hell would have

5680.679 --> 5684.4800000000005
had that country have stayed together as

5683.199 --> 5687.678999999999
well as it

5684.48 --> 5691.5199999999995
has just for some reason the real French

5687.679 --> 5694.96
Legends just don't really stick to

5691.52 --> 5697.1990000000005
mind I don't know what it is

5694.96 --> 5699.36
and like within my lifetime France has

5697.199 --> 5702.08
just been terribly

5699.36 --> 5704.28
liberal so that's not helping either

5702.08 --> 5707.5599999999995
like they are like the forerunners of

5704.28 --> 5709.599999999999
like this insane lipart mind virus that

5707.56 --> 5712.639
has swept the entire Western

5709.6 --> 5715.360000000001
world that's right I mostly blame France

5712.639 --> 5718.6
for that I know America's the Forerunner

5715.36 --> 5721.0
but France is the freaking country that

5718.6 --> 5723.719
inspired that with your stupid Statue of

5721.0 --> 5726.639
Liberty who's a [ __ ] and everybody

5723.719 --> 5730.08
knows it now yeah it's all your damn

5726.639 --> 5733.4800000000005
fault Richard G you and your heritage

5730.08 --> 5736.679
yeah you're the ones that made this

5733.48 --> 5740.919999999999
freaking [ __ ] liberal [ __ ]

5736.679 --> 5740.92
happen yeah it's all your

5742.52 --> 5747.320000000001
fault but I'm not even joking that much

5745.84 --> 5750.96
I mean I'm joking that it's you

5747.32 --> 5754.239
personally but I mean this is serious

5750.96 --> 5756.8
the French invented that [ __ ] okay the

5754.239 --> 5760.759999999999
jacoban Revolution was a satanic

5756.8 --> 5760.76
Revolution you invented that

5773.24 --> 5779.719
[Music]

5775.52 --> 5784.119000000001
[ __ ] like arguably the French invited

5779.719 --> 5784.119
Satan back into the world

5784.679 --> 5793.36
which is kind of ironic since France was

5788.119 --> 5793.36
also the country where allegedly Jesus

5793.679 --> 5800.679
was but maybe that's

5796.52 --> 5800.679
why I don't know it just gets

5804.52 --> 5809.679
complicated it's greenish Statue of

5806.96 --> 5809.679
Liberty

5809.84 --> 5816.56
whatever the copper gets green what do

5812.28 --> 5816.5599999999995
you want Shan G for

5848.4 --> 5854.5199999999995
right but to be

5851.28 --> 5858.48
fair I am

5854.52 --> 5860.8
joking I don't blame all the French for

5858.48 --> 5863.4
inviting the devil back into the world

5860.8 --> 5868.159000000001
or causing

5863.4 --> 5870.879999999999
the like the crazy satanic Communist

5868.159 --> 5874.879999999999
antihuman Revolution that is sweeping

5870.88 --> 5878.400000000001
the world it's not all the French's

5874.88 --> 5882.159000000001
fault but I mean you you have to realize

5878.4 --> 5885.08
that you were the inspiration for all

5882.159 --> 5887.04
that yeah before all this nightmare [ __ ]

5885.08 --> 5891.4
started happening like even in the '90s

5887.04 --> 5894.08
France was like prominently displayed as

5891.4 --> 5897.239
like this is the most liberal Nation on

5894.08 --> 5900.44
earth and the French were proud like we

5897.239 --> 5903.839999999999
are so liberal yeah that's real yeah

5900.44 --> 5906.4
we're not forgetting that okay

5903.84 --> 5910.679
yeah now now it's all freaking demonic

5906.4 --> 5914.0
pedo hell hole [ __ ] it wasn't back then

5910.679 --> 5916.52
but everybody knew France we the most

5914.0 --> 5920.48
liberal oh I'm so proud of it oh yeah

5916.52 --> 5922.2390000000005
well look at it now yeah I'm not just

5920.48 --> 5926.5599999999995
going to

5922.239 --> 5926.5599999999995
overlook what was happening back

5930.96 --> 5934.96
then okay

5938.08 --> 5941.199
hey LSG good to see

5942.52 --> 5946.84
you it's important to have a sense of

5945.04 --> 5949.08
humor when you're hang around YouTube

5946.84 --> 5952.28
right yeah I

5949.08 --> 5956.44
mean but this is just kind of my

5952.28 --> 5959.199
thing I don't know why it's

5956.44 --> 5960.04
just I've always felt like this about

5959.199 --> 5963.96
the

5960.04 --> 5965.88
French even when I was really young like

5963.96 --> 5968.2390000000005
that's genuinely one of my jokes but I

5965.88 --> 5969.1990000000005
mean yeah I can actually freaking argue

5968.239 --> 5972.5599999999995
it

5969.199 --> 5974.919999999999
now but it doesn't mean like we have to

5972.56 --> 5977.080000000001
get rid of all the French like oh

5974.92 --> 5980.4400000000005
they're the evil ones they're the seed

5977.08 --> 5982.639
of Satan and all this liberal Madness is

5980.44 --> 5987.119
only going to go away when we get rid of

5982.639 --> 5990.679
all the fren like h no

5987.119 --> 5993.5199999999995
no yeah so yeah I'd like to keep it a

5990.679 --> 5995.599
joke in that sense and I'm glad that

5993.52 --> 5998.119000000001
there's something I can still be funny

5995.599 --> 6000.28
about and that not just every damn thing

5998.119 --> 6002.598999999999
that I bring up always like ends up in

6000.28 --> 6005.119
some kind of tragic

6002.599 --> 6008.08
feeling it it's good that there's still

6005.119 --> 6011.48
some things that can be funny about

6008.08 --> 6013.92
me because yeah I do realize that I can

6011.48 --> 6017.36
be like a real party

6013.92 --> 6020.56
pooper a humor

6017.36 --> 6022.719
breaker but also because I just can't

6020.56 --> 6024.84
stand cheap humor when people are like

6022.719 --> 6027.84
oh this is is funny like no it's not

6024.84 --> 6032.56
that's [ __ ] lame I hate

6027.84 --> 6032.56
that okay I don't like lame

6043.08 --> 6046.28
jokes all

6047.719 --> 6054.28
right right so anyway Richard you're

6050.239 --> 6057.159
just going to have to get used to that

6054.28 --> 6059.159
I will always see you as that guy who's

6057.159 --> 6062.159
also

6059.159 --> 6062.159
French

6069.679 --> 6072.679
yeah

6073.36 --> 6079.92
right but it could be a great

6077.44 --> 6082.638999999999
thing and then sometimes I'm going to

6079.92 --> 6084.76
blame you for a lot of [ __ ] in the world

6082.639 --> 6086.92
because of that French heritage

6084.76 --> 6089.119000000001
partially as a joke and then other times

6086.92 --> 6092.76
I'll be like yeah no no French are

6089.119 --> 6094.5599999999995
awesome right now like you're not always

6092.76 --> 6097.56
terrible and lame sometimes you're

6094.56 --> 6097.56
awesome

6097.8 --> 6101.119000000001
[Music]

6117.119 --> 6123.08
change your name to that friend no how

6118.92 --> 6127.36
about just letting let him be Shan G why

6123.08 --> 6129.639
did you stop stop being so metalsome

6127.36 --> 6129.639
with

6133.88 --> 6138.96
this you already walk around with the

6136.56 --> 6142.56
tears of millions of ancestors who would

6138.96 --> 6145.159
surrender holy [ __ ] Rich G I'm proud of

6142.56 --> 6145.159000000001
you

6147.4 --> 6155.44
that's a that's a that's strength of

6150.92 --> 6155.4400000000005
character I appreciate that

6173.28 --> 6178.119
what what is that clutch what are you

6179.48 --> 6185.08
doing something went

6182.08 --> 6185.08
wrong

6186.44 --> 6189.44
okay

6190.639 --> 6195.4800000000005
ah okay it's some cartoon

6196.679 --> 6200.679
clip yeah I'm not going to play

6202.119 --> 6207.259
that for

6204.18 --> 6207.259
[Music]

6269.239 --> 6272.239
h

6320.0 --> 6326.48
okay yeah I just checked it out okay so

6323.679 --> 6328.84
a guy gets all outraged about something

6326.48 --> 6330.718999999999
being in unacceptable

6328.84 --> 6333.4800000000005
condition

6330.719 --> 6336.36
okay I don't think I responded like that

6333.48 --> 6340.5599999999995
at all but that's

6336.36 --> 6340.5599999999995
fine I guess

6342.04 --> 6347.44
hahaa I think maybe your unacceptable

6345.32 --> 6351.4
video clip comment is actually

6347.44 --> 6351.4
unacceptable clutch

6361.48 --> 6365.159
not you yeah

6383.119 --> 6392.08
I just like like I did not respond like

6386.679 --> 6394.76
that lemon headed man to Richard G just

6392.08 --> 6397.639
saying I was just like completely

6394.76 --> 6401.159000000001
baffled like how how after everything

6397.639 --> 6403.599
that you've been through and learned and

6401.159 --> 6405.759999999999
faced all the processes would you come

6403.599 --> 6408.08
to the conclusion subtly that it's not

6405.76 --> 6408.08
just

6409.239 --> 6416.48
flat it's not like that's unacceptable I

6412.679 --> 6416.4800000000005
just thought that's

6417.28 --> 6423.5599999999995
crazy like that can't be like logic that

6421.719 --> 6426.84
brought you to that point it has to be

6423.56 --> 6429.679
emotions and so the conclusions was the

6426.84 --> 6433.0
conclusion was it has to be intellectual

6429.679 --> 6435.8
cowardice and then Richard got really

6433.0 --> 6435.8
triggered over

6440.56 --> 6444.84
that Richard said that's unex

6445.239 --> 6448.28
okay I must have missed

6449.639 --> 6455.96
that it's not that crazy yeah you'd say

6452.56 --> 6455.96
that Akuma virus of

6460.639 --> 6468.04
course Richard got triggered

6465.0 --> 6471.0
yeah for my response to

6468.04 --> 6474.0
him but I mean whatever doesn't really

6471.0 --> 6474.0
matter

6476.18 --> 6479.279
[Music]

6483.719 --> 6489.8
I mean I should have realized you know

6487.28 --> 6492.36
that calling him a coward might be

6489.8 --> 6494.96
hitting a sensitive spot be be because

6492.36 --> 6497.32
of the before mentioned reasons right he

6494.96 --> 6501.119
already walks around with the tears of

6497.32 --> 6503.4
millions of ancestors who surrendered so

6501.119 --> 6506.639
I may have just like hid him in a bit of

6503.4 --> 6509.879999999999
a sensitive spot saying that I realize

6506.639 --> 6509.88
that now

6562.159 --> 6568.199
and just can talk crap to everybody you

6565.32 --> 6570.5199999999995
don't agree with well actually I can

6568.199 --> 6572.04
Akuma virus not without consequences but

6570.52 --> 6575.84
I

6572.04 --> 6578.599
can you can't tell me what I can't do

6575.84 --> 6581.8
cuz I can do

6578.599 --> 6584.4800000000005
that I mean if you would have said you

6581.8 --> 6587.360000000001
shouldn't talk crap to everybody that

6584.48 --> 6589.0
you don't disagree with that you don't

6587.36 --> 6592.839999999999
agree with like that would have been

6589.0 --> 6594.48
reasonable but I can actually just talk

6592.84 --> 6597.04
crap to everybody that I don't agree

6594.48 --> 6600.598999999999
with I can absolutely do that yeah

6597.04 --> 6600.599
nobody can stop me doing

6601.0 --> 6606.56
that like that is literally a technical

6604.0 --> 6610.639
possibility and you're incorrect saying

6606.56 --> 6612.400000000001
that I can't I can do that I probably

6610.639 --> 6616.2390000000005
shouldn't do

6612.4 --> 6619.08
that but I can definitely do

6616.239 --> 6624.638999999999
that you know what I mean yeah and I'm

6619.08 --> 6624.639
and you know what I mean akumu virus

6627.28 --> 6631.679
you're not talking about the ability to

6629.119 --> 6635.44
do it yeah I am talking about being hyp

6631.679 --> 6635.4400000000005
specific about these kinds of

6640.84 --> 6645.04
statements just because you can do

6643.119 --> 6650.0
something doesn't mean you

6645.04 --> 6653.119
should yes unless somebody

6650.0 --> 6655.4
challenges that ability to be be able to

6653.119 --> 6655.4
do

6662.679 --> 6668.1990000000005
that don't switch I mean if you don't

6666.199 --> 6671.239
what I mean no I I've lost track at this

6668.199 --> 6671.239
point but that's that's

6681.32 --> 6690.5199999999995
fine down say on the road I've had a

6685.52 --> 6690.52
cracking off the jaw uh

6691.4 --> 6698.92
no but I've definitely just spoken

6696.199 --> 6701.0
out when I think something is terrible

6698.92 --> 6703.28
or wrong

6701.0 --> 6705.88
absolutely but I'm also aware that when

6703.28 --> 6709.239
you do that somebody might take take a

6705.88 --> 6713.88
shot at me and I'm going to be very

6709.239 --> 6713.879999999999
alert when I do that

6718.639 --> 6723.679
like I'm not going to say those things

6721.079 --> 6726.639
and be comfortable and off

6723.679 --> 6729.4
guard I am on guard when I say such

6726.639 --> 6734.639
things because I know people will be

6729.4 --> 6734.638999999999
pitiful enough to be insulted by it

6744.719 --> 6748.199
hey Optimus good to see

6763.4 --> 6769.28
you don't say things you would not say

6766.599 --> 6773.679
in real life yeah but I do actually say

6769.28 --> 6773.679
those types of things in real life

6782.04 --> 6787.28
that's right the Corman diplomacy yeah

6784.599 --> 6790.719
and sometimes I just

6787.28 --> 6793.92
fail sometimes I just fail at those

6790.719 --> 6796.76
things but I'll still try to be honest

6793.92 --> 6800.119
because if I don't express things

6796.76 --> 6802.719
honestly then like I become really

6800.119 --> 6803.88
troubled and I can like shoot into some

6802.719 --> 6806.719
kind of

6803.88 --> 6809.28
depression that happened in the past if

6806.719 --> 6809.28
I hold

6810.119 --> 6817.839999999999
back it's better to be honest and risk

6813.719 --> 6823.32
being not diplomatic than to hold

6817.84 --> 6823.32
back and that's just how it works for me

6848.239 --> 6852.598999999999
might did someone talk on the road like

6850.239 --> 6855.5199999999995
I would talk to you there well Moxy

6852.599 --> 6859.32
there's the thing I wouldn't talk to a

6855.52 --> 6862.0
person like you on the road I would have

6859.32 --> 6863.32
sensed like I don't want to deal with a

6862.0 --> 6867.0
person like

6863.32 --> 6869.719
that I would avoid a person like you on

6867.0 --> 6873.8
the road and i' never get to the point

6869.719 --> 6876.8
of having to talk as I do to you on the

6873.8 --> 6876.8
road

6893.679 --> 6900.28
yeah because on the road I have more

6896.4 --> 6903.239
Liberty to stay to to stay away from

6900.28 --> 6905.4
individuals that I don't vibrate with

6903.239 --> 6908.44
that I don't really want to associate

6905.4 --> 6911.44
with and I don't have that

6908.44 --> 6914.839999999999
luxury despite what you might

6911.44 --> 6917.5199999999995
think yeah people can force themselves

6914.84 --> 6921.84
into my attention on the internet way

6917.52 --> 6921.84
better than physical life

6926.84 --> 6932.2390000000005
if if they force

6929.52 --> 6934.52
themselves in my way in my physical life

6932.239 --> 6937.28
you better damn well believe I'm going

6934.52 --> 6942.4400000000005
to talk exactly like I

6937.28 --> 6942.44
do on this show and probably way

6951.239 --> 6955.28
worse e

7008.32 --> 7014.239
okay it seems the conversation has moved

7010.96 --> 7014.2390000000005
on so that's fine

7019.96 --> 7023.92
almost at the 2our

7023.96 --> 7029.679
Mark I'm glad that it rolled off that

7026.48 --> 7032.799999999999
was a weird start of the show

7029.679 --> 7036.2390000000005
though with nobody talking for

7032.8 --> 7039.719
like over half an

7036.239 --> 7042.28
hour but now it's all very active so

7039.719 --> 7043.56
that's cool

7042.28 --> 7047.04
all right I'm am going to take a two

7043.56 --> 7050.76
minute break though maybe make another

7047.04 --> 7050.76

for

7191.04 --> 7194.04

7471.1 --> 7474.179
[Music]

[Music]

7501.0 --> 7506.04
I ever got into a fight on the road no

7669.8 --> 7673.4400000000005
out well for you

7688.4 --> 7694.92
what asking another man if about his

7691.92 --> 7694.92
fight history

7698.0 --> 7702.44
is in a way

7703.4 --> 7707.5199999999995
yeah that's weird though it's getting

7705.52 --> 7710.360000000001
complicated

7707.52 --> 7713.76
like somebody should ask Owen Benjamin

7710.36 --> 7713.759999999999
about that

7760.88 --> 7767.76
no I get woodworking by gy

7763.719 --> 7771.119
bear it's like wrestling kind of

7767.76 --> 7773.2390000000005
gay right it's based on this assumption

7771.119 --> 7775.88
that there's some form of gay

7773.239 --> 7779.0
suppression that is then expressed in

7775.88 --> 7782.119
fighting and it's like oh if you can't

7779.0 --> 7787.079
have sex with them you can at least like

7782.119 --> 7787.079
wrestle with them it's from that

7787.36 --> 7791.679
perspective I get it

7799.96 --> 7807.04
like if a man is a little bit too

7802.76 --> 7809.360000000001
much into or enthusiastic about brawling

7807.04 --> 7811.84
and all that like yeah that that does

7809.36 --> 7814.96
become gay

7811.84 --> 7817.719
suspicious that's what woodworking guny

7814.96 --> 7817.719
Bears talking

7820.32 --> 7826.429999999999
about for

7823.23 --> 7826.429999999999
[Music]

7854.04 --> 7857.119
[Music]

7871.5 --> 7874.55
[Music]

7880.44 --> 7883.239
okay

7889.28 --> 7892.28
in

7917.079 --> 7922.04
I got a title for

7919.599 --> 7927.88
today actually built the ancient

7922.04 --> 7927.88
buildings and and how and the French

7932.48 --> 7940.5199999999995
dilemma that [ __ ] uh properly fit the

7937.0 --> 7940.52
show I think

7941.96 --> 7945.36
hello Oz

7979.159 --> 7982.159
in

8028.079 --> 8032.639
blocking is weak n

8038.119 --> 8041.719
or just efficient

8048.85 --> 8051.879000000001
[Music]

8066.639 --> 8071.079
yeah Optimus Moxy is always very good at

8069.079 --> 8075.199
putting words in other people's mouths

8071.079 --> 8075.199
he does that a lot so

8095.84 --> 8102.0
see the ball with my naked eyes like how

8099.84 --> 8103.639
well you look through a telescope and

8102.0 --> 8106.119
then you

8103.639 --> 8109.2390000000005
saw something that you could think of as

8106.119 --> 8111.36
a ball in the

8109.239 --> 8113.4
sky that's how you know you're standing

8111.36 --> 8115.36
on a ball because you're looking at

8113.4 --> 8120.04
something that you thought of as a ball

8115.36 --> 8120.04
in the sky right makes perfect sense

8125.44 --> 8132.678999999999
right I mean this makes perfect sense

8128.119 --> 8135.96
just as above so below above there's a

8132.679 --> 8139.28
light in the sky I think of it as a ball

8135.96 --> 8143.92
below there's the Earth I'm standing on

8139.28 --> 8145.639
so it is a ball too As Above So Below

8143.92 --> 8147.679
I'm looking at something that I'm

8145.639 --> 8150.079
thinking of as a ball so that means I'm

8147.679 --> 8152.92
standing on a ball I mean it makes

8150.079 --> 8152.92
perfect sense

8155.44 --> 8158.839999999999
am I right

8185.559 --> 8192.04
okay woodworking gyber you're taking

8187.679 --> 8192.04
this too far now please don't go there

8209.84 --> 8213.880000000001
please for

8259.16 --> 8262.439
what what are you talking about by the

8260.84 --> 8265.599
way my

8262.439 --> 8268.24
roads talk saying three minutes ago I've

8265.599 --> 8271.719000000001
been thinking about this Dark Night of

8268.24 --> 8274.319
the soul and ego death the idea of awful

8271.719 --> 8274.319
grace of

8275.04 --> 8280.84
God and then of course a joke about if

8278.0 --> 8283.359
that's gay but I mean what do you mean

8280.84 --> 8284.399
though what have you been thinking about

8283.359 --> 8287.76
that

8284.399 --> 8292.279999999999
for I've never heard of the awful grace

8287.76 --> 8292.28
of God never heard of that

8296.76 --> 8302.76
before clutch could you please just not

8299.88 --> 8302.759999999998
do that

8311.599 --> 8315.92
forced growth ego death yeah but there

8313.92 --> 8319.439
is no ego

8315.92 --> 8319.439
death that can't

8324.639 --> 8330.119999999999
happen you can only tame the ego

8331.679 --> 8334.84
you yeah you got a

8338.2 --> 8343.92
wrench this terrible of woodworking guny

8341.0 --> 8347.24
bear brought that up once not now you're

8343.92 --> 8347.24
repeating it yeah

8353.08 --> 8360.08
thanks that nobody that watches my show

8357.0 --> 8362.2
needs to know what that means okay

8360.08 --> 8365.719
thanks thanks a

8362.2 --> 8368.2
lot I don't need gay specialist

8365.719 --> 8370.839999999998
knowledge to be dispensed in my show

8368.2 --> 8370.84
thank you very

8384.04 --> 8391.0
much ego death is reached with

8387.04 --> 8391.0
hallucinate what

8394.0 --> 8401.439
no no that's called suppression yeah

8398.08 --> 8406.28
when the lination stu oh guess what your

8401.439 --> 8406.28
ego is still there it doesn't

8407.56 --> 8416.08
die yeah death is a oneway

8411.64 --> 8419.519999999999
change ego doesn't die unless you

8416.08 --> 8421.56
die you can learn to manage it you can

8419.52 --> 8424.52
learn to put it in a cage they're

8421.56 --> 8427.96
reprioritized but it doesn't go

8424.52 --> 8427.960000000001
away you can

8430.04 --> 8436.319000000001
just because it's like your strength and

8433.24 --> 8438.88
determination also lie within the ego

8436.319 --> 8441.479
it's like the ego is part of the

8438.88 --> 8443.399
Soul if you're very strong Soul you have

8441.479 --> 8446.039999999999
a very strong ego you're going to have

8443.399 --> 8447.72
challenges with your very strong ego

8446.04 --> 8450.640000000001
because your ego is very strong it's

8447.72 --> 8453.479
also your personal strength in a way

8450.64 --> 8458.24
your individual

8453.479 --> 8458.24
strength ego death is a nonsense

8460.04 --> 8464.560000000001
Theory and the ego is wildly

8473.0 --> 8478.84
misunderstood I mean yes the ego can be

8476.2 --> 8481.16
very disruptive

8478.84 --> 8483.04
in decision making

8481.16 --> 8484.96
for example especially

8483.04 --> 8487.880000000001
socially but I

8484.96 --> 8490.519999999999
mean it is that's just because you're

8487.88 --> 8494.399
not managing it properly

8490.52 --> 8498.08
then you're not putting its input in the

8494.399 --> 8498.08
proper perspective for

8505.52 --> 8510.92
yourself that's right you cannot

8507.72 --> 8513.519999999999
completely kill the ego you can only

8510.92 --> 8516.12
deal with it I mean it I think the

8513.52 --> 8519.359
better way to approach it is like how

8516.12 --> 8522.68
Vulcans are seen in Star Trek yeah they

8519.359 --> 8525.16
have massive ego issues all of them they

8522.68 --> 8528.08
have very strong personality

8525.16 --> 8530.72
issues that they then have to deal with

8528.08 --> 8530.72
with great

8532.0 --> 8538.16
discipline because ego is also like

8534.76 --> 8541.12
source of instinct Etc it's just it's

8538.16 --> 8543.119999999999
like an Earthly part of you but it has

8541.12 --> 8544.399000000001
that fun it has a function and the

8543.12 --> 8547.800000000001
function

8544.399 --> 8551.119999999999
is important is especially important for

8547.8 --> 8553.16
the physical vessel that we're in yeah

8551.12 --> 8555.359
it seems to get in the way of the spirit

8553.16 --> 8557.88
but it's it's like a critical component

8555.359 --> 8561.359
for the physical vessel that we're

8557.88 --> 8561.358999999999
in for our

8566.24 --> 8570.24
bodies so

8581.8 --> 8587.399
oh okay well akumu is making an argument

8584.88 --> 8588.679999999998
wait it doesn't actually mean literally

8587.399 --> 8591.399
what it

8588.68 --> 8593.880000000001
says just like something else doesn't

8591.399 --> 8596.16
literally mean what it says I don't

8593.88 --> 8598.72
think that's really making a good

8596.16 --> 8601.2
argument like oh it doesn't actually

8598.72 --> 8603.599999999999
mean the death of ego it's just we call

8601.2 --> 8606.12
the death of ego but it isn't okay so

8603.6 --> 8606.12
what is it

8609.96 --> 8615.319
then why not just call it the Taming of

8613.279 --> 8618.0
the ego

8615.319 --> 8622.0
then or

8618.0 --> 8622.0
just discipline

8648.64 --> 8651.64
on

8665.04 --> 8668.04
h

8696.439 --> 8700.479000000001
that's a good point borders boy yeah

8700.6 --> 8705.12
self-improvement because of the ego

8722.9 --> 8726.07
[Music]

8726.52 --> 8731.52
all right so yeah now that you have made

8728.6 --> 8735.0
it abundantly clear that ego death

8731.52 --> 8736.880000000001
doesn't actually mean ego death akumo

8735.0 --> 8739.64
virus great

8736.88 --> 8742.96
argument it is kind of Bal arish that

8739.64 --> 8745.599999999999
you make that argument so

8742.96 --> 8748.438999999998
profusely what the hell does it mean

8745.6 --> 8752.04
then if it doesn't actually mean what it

8748.439 --> 8752.04
literally says

8755.359 --> 8759.279
right so instead of telling us that it

8757.2 --> 8763.399000000001
doesn't actually mean what it says could

8759.279 --> 8766.800000000001
you perhaps tell us what it does mean

8763.399 --> 8766.8
then aumu

8767.0 --> 8773.279
virus yeah cuz we get it it doesn't mean

8770.72 --> 8775.16
what it actually says that's cool we we

8773.279 --> 8778.16
understand that now so what does it mean

8775.16 --> 8778.16
then

8784.439 --> 8789.359
right so

8786.04 --> 8792.560000000001
something is reached through

8789.359 --> 8794.279
hallucinations something CU it's not ego

8792.56 --> 8797.08
death

8794.279 --> 8800.24
because you're already disclaim that it

8797.08 --> 8801.72
is that so what then is actually reached

8800.24 --> 8804.319
through

8801.72 --> 8808.199999999999
hallucinations yeah

8804.319 --> 8811.76
maybe ego suppression would be a better

8808.2 --> 8815.439
way of saying it right I mean drugs

8811.76 --> 8817.960000000001
suppress temporarily turn it off yeah

8815.439 --> 8821.319
not death cuz death is a one-way

8817.96 --> 8825.479
Direction something doesn't come

8821.319 --> 8828.399
back so you're not going to reformulate

8825.479 --> 8831.08
yourself you're going to say oh no it

8828.399 --> 8834.358999999999
definitely doesn't actually mean ego

8831.08 --> 8837.88
death but I'm still going to repeat what

8834.359 --> 8841.0
I said exactly as I said

8837.88 --> 8843.0
it without correcting the word word that

8841.0 --> 8847.16
I already disclaimed doesn't actually

8843.0 --> 8850.76
mean what it says brilliant

8847.16 --> 8850.76
brilliant now could you

8851.64 --> 8858.92
please

8854.2 --> 8858.92
just a stage of tripping

8859.359 --> 8863.359
okay right

8873.8 --> 8878.438999999998
so it's just oh yeah you reach a stage

8876.279 --> 8882.479000000001
of tripping when you use huc

8878.439 --> 8884.52
hallucinogenics yeah I agree

8882.479 --> 8887.0
absolutely that's what happens when you

8884.52 --> 8891.560000000001
take hallucinatory

8887.0 --> 8891.56
drugs you go tripping yeah

8896.6 --> 8903.08
thanks it's like yeah I I know when you

8899.84 --> 8907.72
take sugar you get a Sugar

8903.08 --> 8907.72
Rush Oh thanks for the information I

8921.84 --> 8926.399
know right whatever

8951.279 --> 8959.319000000001
I know about yeah but I don't know about

8954.24 --> 8963.68
ego death Akuma virus I'm asked I I've

8959.319 --> 8966.88
asked you to clarify I even made guesses

8963.68 --> 8973.68
as to what you're actually meaning to

8966.88 --> 8973.679999999998
say then but you refuse to reformulate

8974.72 --> 8981.0
yourself and you actually

8978.6 --> 8982.720000000001
downgraded the statement by saying oh

8981.0 --> 8986.279
it's just the stage of tripping well

8982.72 --> 8986.278999999999
that's that doesn't say

8987.279 --> 8993.68
anything so he just stripped it of

8990.12 --> 8996.479000000001
detailed meaning then instead of

8993.68 --> 9000.399
clarifying

8996.479 --> 9003.039999999999
yeah you're just assuming that I know oh

9000.399 --> 9006.68
what I know what you meant no I don't

9003.04 --> 9006.68
know what you meant

9028.84 --> 9031.84
I don't even know why you brought it up

9030.479 --> 9034.278999999999
like why the hell did you even bring

9031.84 --> 9038.12
that up we've been blabbering on about

9034.279 --> 9038.12
it for like 15 minutes or

9043.2 --> 9047.52
something be death is reached with

9045.439 --> 9051.359
hallucinations you you seem to have said

9047.52 --> 9052.439
it in response to

9051.359 --> 9055.68
God's

9052.439 --> 9059.399
grace translated by humans as awful

9055.68 --> 9061.08
Grace something with that Viber oats

9059.399 --> 9065.599999999999
brought up ego

9061.08 --> 9065.6
death so it was response to

9068.279 --> 9074.359
something you're not the first to use

9071.08 --> 9074.359
that word

9098.0 --> 9104.479
there you can get okay yeah but Optimus

9100.76 --> 9104.479
okay thanks for testifying

9104.64 --> 9110.72
but your ego is not dead I mean you

9108.12 --> 9114.560000000001
still have it like you have ego

9110.72 --> 9118.599999999999
responses it's just that now you're just

9114.56 --> 9122.479
way more in control you take it way more

9118.6 --> 9126.68
serious you you're more self

9122.479 --> 9130.519999999999
aware of the ego traits that you have

9126.68 --> 9133.479000000001
and are actively dealing with it but

9130.52 --> 9135.640000000001
that's not the death of the ego it's

9133.479 --> 9137.88
just more

9135.64 --> 9140.599999999999
discipline because those impulses are

9137.88 --> 9143.438999999998
those impulses if you're

9140.6 --> 9146.640000000001
control your grasps your Insight would

9143.439 --> 9149.04
be temporarily blocked or erased those

9146.64 --> 9151.56
ego impulses will come out just as

9149.04 --> 9153.52
strong cuz it that's part of your

9151.56 --> 9155.72
character like your ego and how strong

9153.52 --> 9157.2
it is is like literally part of your

9155.72 --> 9160.599999999999
character

9157.2 --> 9162.880000000001
frequency if that goes away your entire

9160.6 --> 9166.399000000001
personality Alters

9162.88 --> 9167.24
dramatically because the ego is part of

9166.399 --> 9170.479
your

9167.24 --> 9171.92
personality like how strong it is

9170.479 --> 9174.399
the challenges that come with the

9171.92 --> 9174.399
strength of

9180.12 --> 9183.399000000001
it an

9184.0 --> 9190.439
act my okay well that you hating your

9187.56 --> 9192.08
ego is that's your ego so it's

9190.439 --> 9196.92
self-loathing

9192.08 --> 9199.439
I have that too it's part of my ego i' I

9196.92 --> 9201.76
have to like wrestle with my ego all the

9199.439 --> 9201.76
time

9220.479 --> 9226.96
right again strength of character is

9223.12 --> 9229.399000000001
dependent on strength of ego it's just

9226.96 --> 9231.8
it becomes strength of character because

9229.399 --> 9234.76
you are taming your ego you're getting

9231.8 --> 9237.8
it under control and then it becomes

9234.76 --> 9239.960000000001
strength of character where before

9237.8 --> 9243.599999999999
you're like undisciplined and you're

9239.96 --> 9245.399
like not self-conscious and you just sin

9243.6 --> 9248.319
in plain sight and think you can get

9245.399 --> 9250.479
away with everything right that's like

9248.319 --> 9254.8
the ego that's what people call

9250.479 --> 9258.24
egotistical people selfish blind foolish

9254.8 --> 9260.319
but then the person somehow goes into a

9258.24 --> 9261.84
personal Revolution and like like really

9260.319 --> 9263.16
starts to become aware of what they're

9261.84 --> 9267.56
doing

9263.16 --> 9269.76
and they're become self-conscious of it

9267.56 --> 9272.68
then that person can turn that around

9269.76 --> 9273.800000000001
and actually now tame that strength of

9272.68 --> 9278.279
their

9273.8 --> 9281.599999999999
ego and and attain Great

9278.279 --> 9284.800000000001
Character strength of character so it is

9281.6 --> 9286.279
the same Source ego is also the source

9284.8 --> 9288.399
of strength of

9286.279 --> 9290.279
character but it becomes strength of

9288.399 --> 9296.358999999999
character after you've looked become

9290.279 --> 9299.960000000001
self-aware of it and learned to tame

9296.359 --> 9303.6
it to take conscious control instead of

9299.96 --> 9306.679999999998
letting your your impulses be the

9303.6 --> 9306.68
manager of your

9307.399 --> 9310.399
actions

9317.52 --> 9324.560000000001
right right and sometimes you'll still

9320.359 --> 9327.359
let your impulses be the the managers of

9324.56 --> 9329.199999999999
your actions I I do that still it's just

9327.359 --> 9331.439
you have to be very careful with the

9329.2 --> 9334.92
frequencies that you're going to allow

9331.439 --> 9334.92
it to to to

9335.359 --> 9341.08
walk like the ego is in a cage but

9339.04 --> 9343.240000000002
you're going to give it things to do but

9341.08 --> 9346.12
you have to be very careful what kind of

9343.24 --> 9349.399
diet you feed

9346.12 --> 9350.439
it cuz if you just give it everything

9349.399 --> 9352.16
it's

9350.439 --> 9355.08
it's going to do everything and it's

9352.16 --> 9358.8
going to go everywhere and over all

9355.08 --> 9358.8
borders and ruin a bunch of

9361.59 --> 9364.739
[Music]

9373.24 --> 9378.84
things taming yourself right

9376.0 --> 9382.0
exactly well taming yourself taming your

9378.84 --> 9384.64
the ego quality the impulses

9382.0 --> 9386.319
right cuz the impulses have brought a

9384.64 --> 9388.479
lot of trouble in your life you

9386.319 --> 9391.72
recognized that you're very aware of

9388.479 --> 9394.319
that it's like confessing it when you

9391.72 --> 9396.399
tell people about

9394.319 --> 9398.479
that those are the lessons you've

9396.399 --> 9402.039999999999
learned and those are the lessons you

9398.479 --> 9405.76
keep to remind yourself of like you have

9402.04 --> 9407.92
to keep control over it or things will

9405.76 --> 9411.24
go wrong like that that's the lesson

9407.92 --> 9413.399
that's the motivation for you to to tame

9411.24 --> 9416.8
your own

9413.399 --> 9420.08
ego and in doing so become a better more

9416.8 --> 9422.64
productive person and less destructive

9420.08 --> 9425.6
because an untamed ego tends to be

9422.64 --> 9425.599999999999
destructive in

9437.84 --> 9442.24
nature right

9440.2 --> 9444.12
but yeah I think that that's a better

9442.24 --> 9446.399
way to look at it better way to describe

9444.12 --> 9449.12
it more technically accurate than the

9446.399 --> 9451.119999999999
death of ego because you hear it a lot

9449.12 --> 9454.76
death of ego you have to get rid of the

9451.12 --> 9454.76
ego but it's that's

9455.0 --> 9464.279
just it's unrealistic that's like the

9458.359 --> 9467.56
ego fooling you into looking at gaining

9464.279 --> 9469.560000000001
discipline over yourself and the ego

9467.56 --> 9472.92
it's like the ego trying to trick you

9469.56 --> 9474.199999999999
you into thinking about taming the ego

9472.92 --> 9477.76
as killing

9474.2 --> 9480.2
it which can never really happen it's

9477.76 --> 9483.52
like the devil in you is trying to fool

9480.2 --> 9485.6
you into that you can get rid of him

9483.52 --> 9488.6
when you

9485.6 --> 9491.479000000001
can't that's kind of what the idea of

9488.6 --> 9493.52
ego death is it's literally like the

9491.479 --> 9497.199999999999
devil in

9493.52 --> 9501.08
you which you could consider it as such

9497.2 --> 9501.08
or an Earthly power

9501.64 --> 9505.84
that a mythology like that you can get

9504.6 --> 9508.800000000001
rid of

9505.84 --> 9510.92
it but you can't you can't actually like

9508.8 --> 9514.119999999999
do one thing and then it just dies

9510.92 --> 9516.6
because if that part of you dies then so

9514.12 --> 9519.319000000001
does purpose

9516.6 --> 9522.479000000001
itself like your experience your

9519.319 --> 9525.519999999999
sensation of purpose then dies if your

9522.479 --> 9529.8
ego dies like your soul because the ego

9525.52 --> 9532.84
is like that's literally the soul

9529.8 --> 9535.358999999999
it's you it's your unique thing it's

9532.84 --> 9537.960000000001
your character

9535.359 --> 9539.439
balance it's what makes you you it's

9537.96 --> 9543.839999999998
what makes

9539.439 --> 9547.04
you do things what makes you long for

9543.84 --> 9549.6
things motivates you to to do

9547.04 --> 9552.0
things you can't kill it you can't kill

9549.6 --> 9554.08
the ego because then you become a

9552.0 --> 9556.8
zombie that's what

9554.08 --> 9560.8
happens you become a zombie without the

9556.8 --> 9564.56
ego that's the [ __ ] liberal issue

9560.8 --> 9567.64
they have ego death or something like so

9564.56 --> 9570.88
suppressed that it just never attainable

9567.64 --> 9573.278999999999
it is suppression without managing the

9570.88 --> 9575.399
ego they suppress the ego and they don't

9573.279 --> 9578.0
manage it they don't learn to deal with

9575.399 --> 9580.24
it they ignore it and they suppress it

9578.0 --> 9582.0
and then you become a zombie that

9580.24 --> 9583.399
literally doesn't know what the [ __ ]

9582.0 --> 9585.08
they're talking about about the

9583.399 --> 9587.519999999999
consequences of what they're talking

9585.08 --> 9590.0
about and they'll just Echo The

9587.52 --> 9593.720000000001
Narrative that's what we call call a

9590.0 --> 9594.76
zombie that's somebody who isn't dealing

9593.72 --> 9598.479
with their

9594.76 --> 9601.12
ego they just declared enemy to their

9598.479 --> 9604.199999999999
ego and all everything in that direction

9601.12 --> 9606.08
and then ignores and suppresses it not

9604.2 --> 9609.720000000001
learn to deal with it if you learn to

9606.08 --> 9615.56
deal with it then you master it and you

9609.72 --> 9615.56
become a strong character that's in

9616.479 --> 9621.92
control so it's really ironic in that

9619.04 --> 9623.52
sense that people call it ego death and

9621.92 --> 9624.399
then think that that's a good thing when

9623.52 --> 9629.16
it's

9624.399 --> 9633.278999999999
actually a wrong thing if you took that

9629.16 --> 9634.92
literal because these nutcase lefties

9633.279 --> 9639.12
sjw

9634.92 --> 9641.56
types that is ego death that is them

9639.12 --> 9644.240000000002
suppressing it and declaring their ego

9641.56 --> 9647.0
their enemy suppressing it and just like

9644.24 --> 9649.0
no I'm a I'm the collective whatever the

9647.0 --> 9651.84
collective says that's my opinion that's

9649.0 --> 9654.6
what going to defend that's ego death

9651.84 --> 9654.6
that's the

9655.2 --> 9659.6
collective that's what nobody really

9657.76 --> 9661.56
wants unless you're already there and

9659.6 --> 9664.68
part of

9661.56 --> 9667.88
that see how weird that

9664.68 --> 9670.399
is colloquial it goes around as ego

9667.88 --> 9671.72
death when that's actually what the

9670.399 --> 9675.358999999999
opponent

9671.72 --> 9678.24
does arguably like that's what the Beast

9675.359 --> 9681.24
system wants people to do to take

9678.24 --> 9681.24
control over them

9682.12 --> 9684.76
crazy isn't

9688.88 --> 9694.039999999999
it like even the words that we just

9691.72 --> 9698.72
generally use out there

9694.04 --> 9700.560000000001
colloquial like we feel like we know

9698.72 --> 9702.64
what they mean like even when it was

9700.56 --> 9705.56
said to me like oh ego death like I

9702.64 --> 9708.24
immediately know what you mean with that

9705.56 --> 9711.199999999999
it's just that when you then like

9708.24 --> 9714.199999999999
carefully think about the

9711.2 --> 9716.880000000001
words then the words are exactly the

9714.2 --> 9719.68
opposite of what it really

9716.88 --> 9724.278999999999
is that people mean with

9719.68 --> 9727.84
it and that's like a weird thing it's

9724.279 --> 9731.0
almost like a weird Mandela effect type

9727.84 --> 9735.04
thing like we're we're

9731.0 --> 9738.84
using words that actually mean exactly

9735.04 --> 9740.080000000002
the opposite of what we mean with those

9738.84 --> 9743.12
words

9740.08 --> 9745.6
that's ego death the way that it's used

9743.12 --> 9748.439
is exactly the opposite of what we

9745.6 --> 9750.399000000001
actually mean when we say ego death how

9748.439 --> 9753.68
crazy is

9750.399 --> 9758.439
that that that just naturally

9753.68 --> 9760.68
happens we end up say using words

9758.439 --> 9763.960000000001
intending the exact opposite of the

9760.68 --> 9769.399
meaning of how does that

9763.96 --> 9769.399
happen how does that just slip in there

9778.63 --> 9781.699999999999
[Music]

9794.64 --> 9801.119999999999
it's a separate entity of one's social

9797.76 --> 9801.12
physical environment

9805.359 --> 9812.56
yeah so you then by ego death it means

9810.12 --> 9815.160000000002
you are no longer a

9812.56 --> 9818.0
separate from your environment so you

9815.16 --> 9819.72
then become part of the collective yeah

9818.0 --> 9823.68
that's exactly what I

9819.72 --> 9825.96
meant that's exactly what I meant the

9823.68 --> 9829.2
kuma

9825.96 --> 9832.88
virus but that's not what people mean

9829.2 --> 9836.640000000001
with it when they talk about

9832.88 --> 9839.599999999999
it just that's not what you're striving

9836.64 --> 9843.72
for right you're striving for personal

9839.6 --> 9848.08
understanding not to be dissolved in a

9843.72 --> 9850.88
hole because that's becoming part of a

9848.08 --> 9855.0
collective that's not what you guys are

9850.88 --> 9855.0
striving for are you

9874.12 --> 9880.279
so yeah but that makes no sense kumu

9877.72 --> 9883.599999999999
virus because again that's not

9880.279 --> 9885.6
death if you're having like some kind of

9883.6 --> 9887.439
universal understanding that's being

9885.6 --> 9889.880000000001
resonated by other people having the

9887.439 --> 9891.76
same Universal understanding

9889.88 --> 9892.8
that's not because of ego death that's

9891.76 --> 9897.84
just called

9892.8 --> 9897.84
resonance there's nothing dying in that

9897.92 --> 9905.08
moment that makes you resonate and think

9901.76 --> 9905.08
the same ideas as

9905.359 --> 9912.16
others you're still separate you're just

9908.439 --> 9915.64
resonating you can be separate and still

9912.16 --> 9917.52
resonate still be the same be separate

9915.64 --> 9921.519999999999
and the

9917.52 --> 9921.52
same there not the ego

9923.24 --> 9928.76
death yeah I get it akumu virus yeah

9926.359 --> 9931.479000000001
it's the definition you have maybe you

9928.76 --> 9934.6
should send me some

9931.479 --> 9936.64
screenshots okay maybe you need to

9934.6 --> 9939.640000000001
convince me some more that that's the

9936.64 --> 9942.479
definition you have yeah I get it I'm

9939.64 --> 9945.24
just telling you

9942.479 --> 9949.08
that's a

9945.24 --> 9951.64
very outdated perspective that's a like

9949.08 --> 9954.16
an outdated definition of like 20th

9951.64 --> 9954.16
century

9974.92 --> 9980.359
psychology how is it outdated if that's

9977.68 --> 9983.52
how we use it today because how you're

9980.359 --> 9987.439
using it today is

9983.52 --> 9990.399000000001
outdated need any more blatantly obvious

9987.439 --> 9993.399
answers to stupid

9990.399 --> 9993.399
questions

10003.24 --> 10009.8
shees I mean that's like a psycher like

10006.359 --> 10012.08
using Freudian psychology on somebody

10009.8 --> 10014.199999999999
that person recognizing the Freudian

10012.08 --> 10015.319
psychology and saying like uh isn't that

10014.2 --> 10017.800000000001
little

10015.319 --> 10020.439
outdated aren't there more effective

10017.8 --> 10023.278999999999
ways to deal with psychology and say

10020.439 --> 10025.68
like no this is like officially still in

10023.279 --> 10028.319000000001
the psychological manual as something

10025.68 --> 10030.56
that you can use as an approach like

10028.319 --> 10032.479
yeah but it is outdated people do

10030.56 --> 10037.08
recognize that that's

10032.479 --> 10037.08
outdated like that that's your argument

10037.56 --> 10044.08
there oh this is still the way that ego

10040.399 --> 10048.599999999999
death is defined yeah it's outdated it's

10044.08 --> 10048.6
the model of that conception is

10064.92 --> 10070.88
outdated all right this is just getting

10068.359 --> 10073.439
[ __ ] tedious and remote and it's like

10070.88 --> 10076.119999999999
takumu virus always everything has to

10073.439 --> 10077.800000000001
like endlessly

10076.12 --> 10081.84
be

10077.8 --> 10087.0
just chewed and recycled and like this

10081.84 --> 10087.0
why can't we just freaking come to an

10095.16 --> 10099.68
agreement it's kind of tedious

10116.2 --> 10120.800000000001
I it's going to make things against me

10118.96 --> 10123.759999999998
what make a

10120.8 --> 10126.278999999999
point it's only against you if that's

10123.76 --> 10131.279
how you take it that's your ego telling

10126.279 --> 10131.279
you that definitely not a sign of ego

10131.56 --> 10136.56
death yeah cuz the ego always makes

10134.439 --> 10139.92
everything that happens centered around

10136.56 --> 10139.92
it around you as an

10146.68 --> 10151.960000000001
individual he needs to be banned now

10174.16 --> 10176.84
whatever

10182.359 --> 10186.359
see right

10189.56 --> 10195.0
you'll never have an actual convers but

10191.84 --> 10197.12
this is how he this is his perception of

10195.0 --> 10199.319
an actual

10197.12 --> 10201.359
conversation and the ego is always going

10199.319 --> 10203.64
to be there to help him ping pong his

10201.359 --> 10203.640000000001
way

10211.04 --> 10216.640000000001
through the

10213.04 --> 10220.640000000001
cons hostile witness

10216.64 --> 10220.64
what yeah arguably

10225.16 --> 10232.2
oh it wasn't your opinion yeah so you

10227.439 --> 10232.2
your ego is making you separate from

10234.6 --> 10239.640000000001
it forever Hostile

10237.52 --> 10242.880000000001
Witness by

10239.64 --> 10245.199999999999
default hey once a ball [ __ ] always a

10242.88 --> 10245.199999999999
ball

10245.64 --> 10250.16
[ __ ] what did you expect

10251.359 --> 10258.04
right but I

10253.6 --> 10260.279
mean my point is is that ego death yeah

10258.04 --> 10263.239000000001
aumu virus defined it from like

10260.279 --> 10264.92
classical psychology or 20th century

10263.239 --> 10269.199999999999
psychology

10264.92 --> 10274.0
and it's overly

10269.2 --> 10279.399000000001
simplistic that the actual ego does not

10274.0 --> 10282.279
die right the ego death is basically as

10279.399 --> 10285.56
what is described as ego death is really

10282.279 --> 10289.04
deprioritization of the ego or turning

10285.56 --> 10291.359
it off in favor of group

10289.04 --> 10294.84
dynamic or group

10291.359 --> 10297.04
rules is not the death because the word

10294.84 --> 10300.56
death is just

10297.04 --> 10302.880000000001
like used almost

10300.56 --> 10304.6
dramatically in that sense because it

10302.88 --> 10308.64
isn't

10304.6 --> 10311.399000000001
death It's Just DE prioritization

10308.64 --> 10313.599999999999
ego can't die it's like ego is a

10311.399 --> 10316.08
intrical part of

10313.6 --> 10319.16
your of your

10316.08 --> 10323.6
character of your your characteristics

10319.16 --> 10329.84
of how you are your balance what you

10323.6 --> 10329.84
want right that's what we talked about

10339.12 --> 10343.640000000001
right and apparently you claim that

10341.6 --> 10348.08
using hallucinatory

10343.64 --> 10353.16
drugs causes this suppression of the

10348.08 --> 10354.92
ego which is like a chemically forced

10353.16 --> 10358.319
deprioritization of

10354.92 --> 10361.92
it so instead of choosing it through

10358.319 --> 10365.16
character to deprioritize

10361.92 --> 10368.84
it by making a choice to deprioritize it

10365.16 --> 10373.359
like the the drugs then chemically press

10368.84 --> 10373.359
it and you call that ego

10377.479 --> 10380.76
death that's

10381.04 --> 10388.239000000001
it I'm just like like to highlight how

10384.96 --> 10390.919999999998
the description of of that word ego

10388.239 --> 10394.52
death is just very

10390.92 --> 10396.479
misplaced by the nature of the words

10394.52 --> 10400.439
that are part of that

10396.479 --> 10400.438999999998
description like it's not that

10400.96 --> 10407.438999999998
death is a a oneway

10404.16 --> 10409.239
direction it's definitely not that it's

10407.439 --> 10412.52
a

10409.239 --> 10415.399
suppression or deprioritization which is

10412.52 --> 10415.399000000001
suppression by

10418.08 --> 10426.16
choice that's all I mean

10422.96 --> 10430.438999999998
that's that's just how complicated it is

10426.16 --> 10430.439
it's not that complicated at all

10438.16 --> 10444.72
anyway feir Loathing in Las Vegas

10441.16 --> 10444.72
terrible movie about a terrible

10444.76 --> 10453.84
degenerate yeah yeah it

10449.359 --> 10456.720000000001
is but it is kind of funny though it is

10453.84 --> 10462.399
a funny and interesting

10456.72 --> 10462.399
movie but it is is also kind of

10473.76 --> 10478.72
terrible even do a green Chrome yeah I

10479.399 --> 10482.76
know [ __ ]

10485.439 --> 10490.319
up right but I mean that I think that

10488.16 --> 10492.92
that the Adrena Chrome is not

10490.319 --> 10496.239
exclusively extracted from people you

10492.92 --> 10500.92
can actually synthesize

10496.239 --> 10500.92
it or like get it from other

10503.239 --> 10510.96
animals right so I mean the story about

10507.72 --> 10513.72
adren Chrome being from tortured kids

10510.96 --> 10517.72
and all like that

10513.72 --> 10517.72
is like

10518.439 --> 10522.56
it's totally [ __ ] up but it's also

10520.84 --> 10526.279
like

10522.56 --> 10530.479
overplayed it is super extremist it's

10526.279 --> 10532.640000000001
like insane and there's like it's not Fe

10530.479 --> 10536.56
it's like not feasible and I guess that

10532.64 --> 10539.278999999999
that is why it's being overemphasized so

10536.56 --> 10544.08
much by some people CU it's just

10539.279 --> 10544.08
outrageous and absurd

10549.76 --> 10558.16
right when that stuff can definitely be

10554.479 --> 10561.84
made through other

10558.16 --> 10561.84
ways including

10561.88 --> 10568.56
animals which like doesn't really make

10564.52 --> 10570.92
it that much better okay it's still

10568.56 --> 10570.92
messed

10577.239 --> 10581.279
up e

10609.56 --> 10612.479
right so

10613.12 --> 10620.399000000001
uh drug Beach that work what what are

10617.279 --> 10620.399000000001
you talking about fiber

10621.64 --> 10627.358999999999
outs happenings I don't know what that's

10624.359 --> 10627.359

10698.52 --> 10702.479000000001
because if there's a movie called The
