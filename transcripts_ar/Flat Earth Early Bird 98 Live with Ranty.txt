4.22 --> 12.059000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

8.25 --> 17.73
early-bird number 98 I'm your host

12.059 --> 18.779
Arwen and today is don't really know

17.73 --> 23.15
what to make of it

18.779 --> 26.3
it's really sunny but they still

23.15 --> 31.64
chemtrail the hell out of the place and

26.3 --> 35.219
it is so warm I'm just in my t-shirt

31.64 --> 37.8
like needing to keep the door open it's

35.219 --> 44.730000000000004
like spring break type and heat it's

37.8 --> 50.789
really weird also I got up really early

44.73 --> 58.339999999999996
today really really early went out did

50.789 --> 58.34
all kinds of things yeah just check

64.86 --> 75.03
goody Thanks and yeah they started they

71.29 --> 78.13000000000001
like when I got up which was it like

75.03 --> 82.75
half past eight in the morning they were

78.13 --> 88.78
already at it so yesterday wasn't a

82.75 --> 92.53
single single chemtrail even after Sun

88.78 --> 98.22
went down nothing not a single thing and

92.53 --> 109.32
now they're totally spraying it closed

98.22 --> 109.32
and it sucks I have no idea what why

115.2 --> 123.53
but yeah if you just look just looking

119.79 --> 127.29
outside you can see the air clarity is

123.53 --> 129.899
it's not clear just even by the ground

127.29 --> 132.48000000000002
you can already see the particles just

129.899 --> 136.44
floating there like there's a dust storm

132.48 --> 143.13
going on these freakin chemtrails so

136.44 --> 146.97
what the hell is that I'm quite repulsed

143.13 --> 149.959
by it really look I don't even know if

146.97 --> 155.16
it is like poison or anything you know

149.959 --> 157.5
maybe it is just dust can't really say

155.16 --> 168.82999999999998
at this point you know have to take

157.5 --> 168.83
samples but yeah it's

169.13 --> 175.09
it's just dust and it's everywhere now

172.25 --> 175.09
it's like

176.4 --> 186.59900000000002
totally like a dust an artificial dust

181.44 --> 189.659
storm being unleashed and global warming

186.599 --> 192.69
maybe maybe they knew the Sun was going

189.659 --> 196.53
to be unusually hot today so oh my god

192.69 --> 198.629
you can't allow that so I have to spray

196.53 --> 200.31
everything keep on spraying and spraying

198.629 --> 203.54899999999998
and spraying and spraying and spraying

200.31 --> 209.25
until the Sun can't warm up anything

203.549 --> 214.34900000000002
anymore it is [ __ ] so whoever is

209.25 --> 217.73
managing those things up there they must

214.349 --> 222.26
be following some kind of methodology

217.73 --> 224.57899999999998
but it is methodology based in absolutes

222.26 --> 229.79
ludicrous II and nonsense

224.579 --> 233.79000000000002
I don't see the point of it at all just

229.79 --> 236.60899999999998
stop doing it just stop doing it

233.79 --> 240.92999999999998
entirely and just look at what's gonna

236.609 --> 243.48000000000002
happen I'll bet you I'll bet you

240.93 --> 246.22
everything will be better if they just

243.48 --> 253.189
stop doing that

246.22 --> 256.459
you know not saying like weather

253.189 --> 263.40999999999997
modification should be absolutely banned

256.459 --> 267.139
forever you know has its uses if you can

263.41 --> 271.41900000000004
nudge a storm in a different direction

267.139 --> 277.0
or you know prevent serious damage

271.419 --> 283.35999999999996
natural weather damage okay sure but

277.0 --> 283.36
just these these big

285.099 --> 288.529
alterations it doesn't make any damn

287.899 --> 290.77
sense

288.529 --> 290.77
it's

305.61 --> 312.659
but I do want to contest the concept

309.03 --> 317.33
that it is always poison that they're

312.659 --> 317.33
spraying I don't think it is

320.05 --> 323.039
but they are doing something that's for

322.539 --> 326.789
damn sure

323.039 --> 326.789
I've never seen it

343.77 --> 352.77
anyway good morning a GM he's McLeod

350.19 --> 355.38
earlier who was actually first and

352.77 --> 356.33
didn't say first so I don't know who

355.38 --> 359.28
that is

356.33 --> 362.37
that's not a snow cloud because as

359.28 --> 364.34999999999997
McLeod always says first usually the

362.37 --> 366.6
only thing he says but now it just says

364.35 --> 371.70000000000005
hi so must be something totally wrong

366.6 --> 377.40000000000003
with him or maybe maybe he woke up woke

371.7 --> 381.0
up after like it 10-year DMT trip just

377.4 --> 386.96999999999997
got back in his body again I don't know

381.0 --> 393.05
what's going on anyway

386.97 --> 393.05
hm the empty matrix P Mars has been

394.4 --> 398.87
globe busted

398.919 --> 405.49
no I don't see bro Sanchez and I don't

401.53 --> 408.81899999999996
see the marble and I don't see any look

405.49 --> 412.21000000000004
I barely see anyone out there except the

408.819 --> 416.65000000000003
people that I'm used to and that I like

412.21 --> 419.02
and yeah sometimes I start to follow

416.65 --> 421.599
somebody and just keep track to see what

419.02 --> 424.06
they're doing and see if it is

421.599 --> 428.889
interesting if it is useful or if it

424.06 --> 431.46
just gets old or gets convoluted too

428.889 --> 436.0
much and then I stop following them and

431.46 --> 439.21
yeah I know about bro Sanchez and it's

436.0 --> 441.849
really nice and he has absolute [ __ ]

439.21 --> 446.349
in there as well so I don't really care

441.849 --> 447.87899999999996
and same goes for D marble not saying

446.349 --> 449.83
everything they do is [ __ ]

447.879 --> 454.75
absolutely not it's just things that I

449.83 --> 458.889
just yeah why why would I need to follow

454.75 --> 461.979
that you know and absolutely I'm sure

458.889 --> 464.259
there's flat earthers out there that

461.979 --> 466.599
feel exactly the same way about me it's

464.259 --> 468.189
like why is this guy doing this why is

466.599 --> 470.349
this guy doing that it was bad for

468.189 --> 475.86
deflator so we don't want to associate

470.349 --> 479.46
with that we don't care or oh yeah but

475.86 --> 482.86
you know nothing oakley likes him and

479.46 --> 485.979
Patricia steer is nice to him so he must

482.86 --> 489.43
be one of these hills so we cannot trust

485.979 --> 493.839
him so I am NOT going to watch him good

489.43 --> 496.21
for you go do something else you know

493.839 --> 501.43
everybody chooses their own chill they

496.21 --> 504.87899999999996
like to trust it's all [ __ ] it's all

501.43 --> 507.939
[ __ ] I don't think anyone is a show

504.879 --> 512.979
only thing people are shields for is

507.939 --> 516.5790000000001
themselves because who has time to read

512.979 --> 519.49
anyone else's script and then do videos

516.579 --> 522.7289999999999
about that that's what CNN does and it

519.49 --> 524.41
is blatantly obvious because they don't

522.729 --> 526.69
really know what the hell they're

524.41 --> 527.98
talking about you can feel that as

526.69 --> 532.62
they're talking about it

527.98 --> 535.1800000000001
so who else here is doing that nobody

532.62 --> 537.3100000000001
people are just doing what they do

535.18 --> 540.31
they're saying what they think and

537.31 --> 542.31
they're making mistakes and they're

540.31 --> 545.38
finding out good information

542.31 --> 550.51
you know everybody makes mistakes and

545.38 --> 553.75
then everybody also does say good useful

550.51 --> 554.71
things even new things at times and they

553.75 --> 557.83
just do that

554.71 --> 560.74
hey Randy

557.83 --> 562.11
it is good more than our win just after

560.74 --> 564.4
noon now actually yes good afternoon

562.11 --> 567.5500000000001
yeah cool

564.4 --> 571.24
thanks for coming how are you doing Oh

567.55 --> 572.67
worried started airing today you did

571.24 --> 576.07
yeah I mean you surprised me actually

572.67 --> 578.74
yeah well I got up so damn early today

576.07 --> 582.9100000000001
thought I was thinking even going live

578.74 --> 587.1
at 12 o'clock but then I kind of halfway

582.91 --> 590.79
fell asleep again like literally like

587.1 --> 594.52
such a bizarre realization it is

590.79 --> 599.77
February and not being too descriptive

594.52 --> 602.8299999999999
but I was just lying on my bed and it

599.77 --> 604.9
was warm and I could just sleep in the

602.83 --> 607.0600000000001
Sun almost like it was mid summer or

604.9 --> 610.42
something it's such a weird day today

607.06 --> 613.4799999999999
hey I see Adam Meakin thanks for the

610.42 --> 617.55
5-pound super chat donation thanks a lot

613.48 --> 621.4300000000001
for that so Randy what brings you here

617.55 --> 623.02
looks like they're in you know give you

621.43 --> 624.7299999999999
a little bit of support I haven't been

623.02 --> 627.99
on all week and I've been working

624.73 --> 634.57
grafting and I did say I would come on

627.99 --> 636.16
last week you remember sort of this look

634.57 --> 639.19
I have a Daily Show and there's always

636.16 --> 641.14
so much stuff happening because

639.19 --> 644.22
sometimes barely remember what I did

641.14 --> 644.22
three days ago

646.709 --> 652.649
so what's been going on anything any

649.74 --> 653.4300000000001
news I think you subscribe it could have

652.649 --> 655.769
jumped up

653.43 --> 660.9899999999999
well I'd actually jumped down again but

655.769 --> 665.91
I was I was at 1100 and three and then

660.99 --> 668.249
it may be because I made a remark like

665.91 --> 673.019
oh yeah I reached it and then they love

668.249 --> 675.9590000000001
to just they do it just for that they do

673.019 --> 678.689
it just for that it's like oh look oh I

675.959 --> 681.1389999999999
think he's there uh and now oh you're

678.689 --> 691.41
not there ooh and they have their troll

681.139 --> 692.939
victory of total uselessness ya know

691.41 --> 695.189
it's their Flat Earth has been blowing

692.939 --> 697.439
up recently a I've seen the subscribe

695.189 --> 699.8389999999999
account her Nathan he's gone through the

697.439 --> 701.3689999999999
roof as me and I've been picking up a

699.839 --> 702.99
few subs now and then you know I'm a

701.369 --> 704.6700000000001
bridging about ten a day so it's all God

702.99 --> 708.119
I mean you can see if there's a lot more

704.67 --> 712.05
people coming into the debate yes new

708.119 --> 716.639
people yeah I mean that and new people

712.05 --> 720.449
that are almost copy pastes or like copy

716.639 --> 722.429
pastes of all people well I don't know I

720.449 --> 723.779
mean the the the guy that I'm more

722.429 --> 725.029
interested in right now is that like

723.779 --> 728.429
life is short

725.029 --> 732.179
Travis Travis is his name really and yes

728.429 --> 733.889
his real name and yeah I mean he's doing

732.179 --> 735.329
some sensational work essentially

733.889 --> 736.949
everything we've been trying to figure

735.329 --> 739.559
out with the horizon he's put it

736.949 --> 741.99
together and everyone should go over and

739.559 --> 744.209
subscribe over there definitely yep yeah

741.99 --> 747.379
I have watches stuff yeah it's brilliant

744.209 --> 752.7299999999999
I don't really like the name though what

747.379 --> 758.4590000000001
well you know in May but this person was

752.73 --> 762.86
just like nah but it's okay it's fine

758.459 --> 764.459
it is technically it is like a

762.86 --> 767.369
philosophical stance

764.459 --> 770.309
it doesn't like make nervous it's almost

767.369 --> 772.049
like yeah life is short I'm gonna put

770.309 --> 773.939
everything that we're not supposed to

772.049 --> 776.189
put out there out there right now and

773.939 --> 778.639
take all the risk that's how it feels

776.189 --> 778.639
all of us

779.47 --> 784.25
you know do you know what when you talk

783.17 --> 786.02
about philosophy you're obviously

784.25 --> 787.19
talking about globs you've got to throw

786.02 --> 788.18
the globe in with that because it's

787.19 --> 790.3100000000001
actually that's all it is

788.18 --> 793.37
and I've seen we've got their conspiracy

790.31 --> 795.02
flaps in the in the chat I don't know

793.37 --> 796.4590000000001
how he's allowed to speak there but

795.02 --> 799.91
that's your choice isn't it I'm prepared

796.459 --> 803.7199999999999
I win more people like him we'll never

799.91 --> 806.66
go over - life is short and watch that

803.72 --> 808.7
and understand it and apply that to the

806.66 --> 811.2199999999999
whole man after they understand how

808.7 --> 813.83
optics work they won't do that because

811.22 --> 816.74
it will you know they'll go sit in a

813.83 --> 818.6600000000001
corner shaking and crying that they've

816.74 --> 822.92
lost the ball if they did that and

818.66 --> 825.709
that's why they won't go over there what

822.92 --> 828.5
to be fair like life is short and his

825.709 --> 832.1899999999999
data is really tense

828.5 --> 835.01
it is really compacted and I have

832.19 --> 837.95
basically so far only glanced at it from

835.01 --> 840.95
a distance because it is just so compact

837.95 --> 845.2090000000001
that I feel like that meets some more

840.95 --> 848.36
and you know the mind is almost like a

845.209 --> 850.43
room if you put too many things in it

848.36 --> 853.01
you can't maneuver anymore so it feels

850.43 --> 857.029
like I just need to gradually clean

853.01 --> 860.87
things up work the older stuff out make

857.029 --> 865.99
some room and then get that giant pile

860.87 --> 865.99
of new compacted data in there somehow

866.77 --> 870.68
so what Sheila plans this year i

868.73 --> 872.54
wouldíve are you gonna move places are

870.68 --> 878.0
you gonna you gonna still stay in that

872.54 --> 881.329
room or what were you gonna do staying

878.0 --> 885.62
in this room yep you can go insane

881.329 --> 888.77
sitting in the room like that you say we

885.62 --> 890.27
could I could you could literally go

888.77 --> 895.02
insane it's like a prison zone

890.27 --> 900.18
yeah I know you know sanity

895.02 --> 903.18
sanity is overrated hmm

900.18 --> 907.38
but not yet look I I technically don't

903.18 --> 910.55
want to live here forever but you need

907.38 --> 914.37
some serious financial foundations

910.55 --> 919.8599999999999
before I even consider getting anything

914.37 --> 922.32
else because even a modest you don't

919.86 --> 925.5
stay that area Eve argument with the

922.32 --> 930.3900000000001
miniature garden is just middle-class

925.5 --> 933.78
now here okay you have to be rich to

930.39 --> 936.33
just get a moderate apartment almost

933.78 --> 939.12
it's crazy the nettle and it's getting

936.33 --> 941.84
worse much worse well when you say rich

939.12 --> 948.21
I mean how much is an apartment over the

941.84 --> 950.5500000000001
rent yeah if you could rent it yeah well

948.21 --> 955.13
it does depend on where the location

950.55 --> 955.13
isn't in big cities it's always more

955.25 --> 962.43
with my ex in limber which is pretty

960.39 --> 966.12
much in the middle of nowhere it's in

962.43 --> 968.12
between countries between Belgium and

966.12 --> 972.05
Germany that part of the Netherlands

968.12 --> 975.5600000000001
yeah got a pretty like half a house

972.05 --> 979.5
pretty big three floors including the

975.56 --> 981.9599999999999
attic attic and a garage even and that

979.5 --> 984.87
was like 800 euros a month

981.96 --> 987.75
that's dirt they're cheap if you want

984.87 --> 990.65
anything of that size here it's gonna be

987.75 --> 990.65
at least double that

991.13 --> 1001.43
it's the Netherlands so yeah I

998.04 --> 1004.49
I couldn't even pay for that on social

1001.43 --> 1007.6999999999999
welfare if I just stopped eating and

1004.49 --> 1009.62
doing anything else like then even with

1007.7 --> 1013.58
money and get from social welfare I

1009.62 --> 1018.71
couldn't even pay for that so yeah but

1013.58 --> 1021.2900000000001
look it's all moving on my financial

1018.71 --> 1024.56
backup plan through my dad the GTI thing

1021.29 --> 1027.49
is going really well really really well

1024.56 --> 1030.11
actually much better than expected and

1027.49 --> 1034.76
if everything goes all right I'll be

1030.11 --> 1039.4699999999998
full in that system within a year now so

1034.76 --> 1041.329
that's good yeah that's very good and at

1039.47 --> 1044.39
the same time yeah the YouTube thing is

1041.329 --> 1048.58
also going pretty well you know and my

1044.39 --> 1054.2
subscribers aren't exactly rocketing but

1048.58 --> 1056.6899999999998
rocketing but yeah it's still going and

1054.2 --> 1058.46
the super chats are steadily growing and

1056.69 --> 1060.92
I can get a camera

1058.46 --> 1063.74
pretty soon probably I don't know how

1060.92 --> 1066.3500000000001
long it's gonna take and yeah

1063.74 --> 1068.86
I'm pretty damn sure that once Arwen

1066.35 --> 1071.87
actually does something else except

1068.86 --> 1076.1599999999999
sitting in his room facing the webcam

1071.87 --> 1080.27
talking and doing more stuff that

1076.16 --> 1082.97
probably that's gonna expand as well so

1080.27 --> 1086.3799999999999
well literally what this life is short

1082.97 --> 1090.2
is doing is essentially taking your

1086.38 --> 1092.99
optical slump basically and basically

1090.2 --> 1095.3300000000002
that deciphered that and it is what you

1092.99 --> 1096.71
were trying to document you know when

1095.33 --> 1099.23
you when you was putting diagrams

1096.71 --> 1102.2
together on the platters debates yeah I

1099.23 --> 1105.32
am seriously impressed by it and I do

1102.2 --> 1107.6000000000001
feel like well this person is closer to

1105.32 --> 1111.3799999999999
unraveling the complete details of it

1107.6 --> 1114.1399999999999
more than anyone I've met so far so yeah

1111.38 --> 1116.22
he's definitely um on track in that

1114.14 --> 1122.159
sense but

1116.22 --> 1126.51
yeah it's 2018 now 2019 2019 2020 next

1122.159 --> 1129.0590000000002
year I think by the end of 2020 we're

1126.51 --> 1130.799
gonna see a massive change in people's

1129.059 --> 1133.98
opinion about Flat Earth I would say

1130.799 --> 1135.51
this year from the way things have

1133.98 --> 1138.3600000000001
already started with Owen Benjamin

1135.51 --> 1140.01
coming out as a believing it's flat you

1138.36 --> 1141.12
know that's gonna wake up an awful lot

1140.01 --> 1144.299
of people because he has a massive

1141.12 --> 1147.539
region they are all conspiracy analysts

1144.299 --> 1149.94
so I can see a lot of the influx from

1147.539 --> 1153.059
that side of things maybe even filter

1149.94 --> 1156.75
through into the Alex Jones Show you

1153.059 --> 1160.19
know I know Alex Jones was never spoken

1156.75 --> 1163.86
about it but oh yeah he does in

1160.19 --> 1167.69
ridiculous yeah yeah but yeah that's

1163.86 --> 1172.1399999999999
because what Paul Joseph was in my day

1167.69 --> 1172.679
he might step away talk about it I doubt

1172.14 --> 1176.0700000000002
it

1172.679 --> 1178.799
it's just not his thing you know then

1176.07 --> 1181.559
many of these people that Alex Jones has

1178.799 --> 1183.59
on the staff it's just not really their

1181.559 --> 1183.59
thing

1186.46 --> 1191.99
look I think I personally think I have a

1189.65 --> 1195.3500000000001
good spirit theory in that sense and I

1191.99 --> 1198.98
don't want to even get in Alex's way in

1195.35 --> 1204.9189999999999
that sense but I think that NASA is just

1198.98 --> 1209.45
a core part of his organization I think

1204.919 --> 1213.1100000000001
probably the laboratories that he's been

1209.45 --> 1216.529
using to develop his products are NASA

1213.11 --> 1218.57
base yeah but don't you think that every

1216.529 --> 1220.76
time they tried to censor rose it sends

1218.57 --> 1223.34
an influx of people over I mean YouTube

1220.76 --> 1226.49
announced that they were going to censor

1223.34 --> 1230.48
Flat Earth and conspiracy talk that was

1226.49 --> 1232.19
against 911 basically and when they put

1230.48 --> 1234.8600000000001
that in the same sentence it was

1232.19 --> 1236.69
basically given a big red flag towards

1234.86 --> 1239.12
hey look at Flat Earth because everybody

1236.69 --> 1240.919
knows 9/11 didn't happen the way the

1239.12 --> 1244.789
official narrative was told so by

1240.919 --> 1247.789
coupling that those two conspiracies

1244.789 --> 1249.32
together in the same sentence people

1247.789 --> 1251.09
will read that and they'll go well yeah

1249.32 --> 1252.73
we all know 9/11 so why are these seven

1251.09 --> 1255.049
stream Flat Earth what's that all about

1252.73 --> 1256.97
you know so if you've got an open mind

1255.049 --> 1259.7
and you're a little bit of a higher IQ

1256.97 --> 1261.409
you would read that and think hello

1259.7 --> 1263.1200000000001
they're asking me to look into Flat

1261.409 --> 1265.5200000000002
Earth or hello the cemetery platters

1263.12 --> 1269.899
because the girl so coupled it with 9/11

1265.52 --> 1271.82
we know 9/11 is [ __ ] yeah so we'll

1269.899 --> 1273.649
look into the Flat Earth and I think you

1271.82 --> 1276.32
know the everything they seem to do is

1273.649 --> 1277.82
backfiring because people are more you

1276.32 --> 1278.3899999999999
know they don't like being told what to

1277.82 --> 1280.8799999999999
do anymore

1278.39 --> 1282.0490000000002
and the dog gets it people say oh yeah

1280.88 --> 1283.25
you shouldn't look at this people are

1282.049 --> 1286.73
gonna open the door if people are gonna

1283.25 --> 1287.659
look in if I if I gave you a card a

1286.73 --> 1289.52
Christmas card

1287.659 --> 1291.47
now and said don't open it till

1289.52 --> 1296.69
Christmas I guarantee you would open it

1291.47 --> 1302.96
before Christmas because you would be

1296.69 --> 1305.659
nosey well yeah maybe it all depends

1302.96 --> 1307.99
look everybody has their own response

1305.659 --> 1307.99
and

1308.9 --> 1317.3600000000001
I sometimes look at it from a even wider

1314.15 --> 1320.47
perspective and just see people what

1317.36 --> 1323.24
their lives must be kind of like how

1320.47 --> 1325.3700000000001
they are receiving information from

1323.24 --> 1329.24
everyone surrounding them and the

1325.37 --> 1333.32
Internet in general how Google how the

1329.24 --> 1336.65
AI is guiding them because the AI guides

1333.32 --> 1340.34
everyone separately totally separately

1336.65 --> 1343.24
no Google search result is the same with

1340.34 --> 1347.0
said with different people it never is

1343.24 --> 1350.24
very rarely is unless people are like

1347.0 --> 1352.04
obviously mixing then that might happen

1350.24 --> 1354.07
but as long as they're separate it's

1352.04 --> 1357.05
always going to be completely different

1354.07 --> 1360.46
to compartmentalize us information wise

1357.05 --> 1362.809
and as with the whole Flat Earth

1360.46 --> 1366.28
association with the other conspiracies

1362.809 --> 1370.37
yes you have a good point it does bring

1366.28 --> 1373.57
more people to the Flat Earth but it's

1370.37 --> 1378.26
always gonna be the people that are

1373.57 --> 1380.6299999999999
conspiracy theorists that are like that

1378.26 --> 1382.8799999999999
will allow themselves to actually

1380.63 --> 1384.3400000000001
question the official narrative because

1382.88 --> 1389.21
there's plenty of people out there

1384.34 --> 1393.7099999999998
they'll just say yeah sure and just

1389.21 --> 1397.04
don't care yeah I mean you can of people

1393.71 --> 1399.01
are also growing by the way just as more

1397.04 --> 1402.23
people are learning from Flat Earth

1399.01 --> 1406.24
getting more knowledge so do a lot of

1402.23 --> 1409.52
people also wake up to just not care

1406.24 --> 1411.559
because they don't want to deal with it

1409.52 --> 1417.16
at all and they just want to focus

1411.559 --> 1417.16
purely on what they wanna get good

1417.64 --> 1422.15
conspiracy caps being one of them he

1420.17 --> 1424.28
laughed when I said higher IQ and

1422.15 --> 1426.23
essentially that is the exact response

1424.28 --> 1429.05
that you expect from him because he has

1426.23 --> 1432.77
very has a very low IQ you can tell that

1429.05 --> 1435.3799999999999
by the way presents his stuff and also

1432.77 --> 1439.16
the fact that he still doesn't grasp the

1435.38 --> 1440.95
gravity and the you know the the air

1439.16 --> 1443.0800000000002
pressure container the

1440.95 --> 1444.5800000000002
doesn't get it it doesn't understand it

1443.08 --> 1445.96
doesn't realize where he's going wrong

1444.58 --> 1450.4299999999998
even though he does a presentation about

1445.96 --> 1452.98
it and he's drawing a box he doesn't

1450.43 --> 1457.54
understand how you can have gas pressure

1452.98 --> 1458.71
without a container you know he doesn't

1457.54 --> 1460.87
understand that argument

1458.71 --> 1464.6200000000001
ignorance is bliss you must be a very

1460.87 --> 1469.9299999999998
happy person you know really dumb people

1464.62 --> 1471.82
often are I mean I'm hungover right now

1469.93 --> 1476.53
and I can still understand it very

1471.82 --> 1479.02
clearly he doesn't he has no idea

1476.53 --> 1482.17
I don't know fur you had a few drinks

1479.02 --> 1486.16
yesterday yeah yeah about two minutes

1482.17 --> 1488.8600000000001
would he - that's so weird I like know

1486.16 --> 1491.23
there were hangouts and I kind of fell

1488.86 --> 1497.7299999999998
halfway asleep during Patricius thing

1491.23 --> 1497.73
with Russian vids and it annoyed me also

1498.66 --> 1508.8100000000002
you probably know why it's gematria I

1504.18 --> 1512.23
despise gematria and everyone that

1508.81 --> 1515.44
brings forth gematria they start to

1512.23 --> 1517.33
despise me and I have good reasons to do

1515.44 --> 1521.26
that I had like after the debates

1517.33 --> 1525.28
yesterday that guy what is it Flat Earth

1521.26 --> 1527.89
data you know I've had this is some

1525.28 --> 1530.68
pretty heated discussion with him before

1527.89 --> 1536.0800000000002
the other day and he just kept on doing

1530.68 --> 1540.46
that and he went into a globe religious

1536.08 --> 1542.29
like loop but concerned in geometry and

1540.46 --> 1544.3
the guys were completely obsessed with

1542.29 --> 1545.53
that [ __ ] conspiracy caps woman she said

1544.3 --> 1547.4199999999998
telling much Iman tree he doesn't even

1545.53 --> 1548.92
understand that I mean the guys that

1547.42 --> 1551.14
thick he didn't know what an inferior

1548.92 --> 1553.24
Mirage is on a boat you know the CPP

1551.14 --> 1555.01
obviously doesn't he's watching about go

1553.24 --> 1556.48
into the distance and sees an inferior

1555.01 --> 1558.31
Mirage and doesn't grasp what an

1556.48 --> 1559.93
inferior Mirage isn't completely ignores

1558.31 --> 1561.9099999999999
that it's there he doesn't know what

1559.93 --> 1563.92
your mantra is he doesn't understand gas

1561.91 --> 1566.44
pressure without container the guy is

1563.92 --> 1569.13
literally showing you his dumbness right

1566.44 --> 1569.13
now in the chat

1570.09 --> 1585.87
very funny and also it's just tell him

1584.25 --> 1592.41
what it is them all right well gematria

1585.87 --> 1596.25
is is a form of numerology you could say

1592.41 --> 1600.72
it is taking words then transforming

1596.25 --> 1602.93
them into numbers according to a very

1600.72 --> 1608.91
specific type system and then basically

1602.93 --> 1611.13
deducing the number of a sentence of an

1608.91 --> 1613.64
entire book potentially if you have the

1611.13 --> 1616.5600000000002
time to waste on that kind of crap and

1613.64 --> 1620.5800000000002
yeah then you can draw conclusions on

1616.56 --> 1624.09
the numbers and it is a total deduction

1620.58 --> 1627.96
based nonsense thing it's a nonsense

1624.09 --> 1630.6
hobby and the globe yeah it's very much

1627.96 --> 1634.3700000000001
like the globe and and I would love to

1630.6 --> 1637.4599999999998
emphasize an example about that because

1634.37 --> 1641.58
yeah flatter data was constantly like

1637.46 --> 1644.55
but Patricia steer is 33 mark surgeon is

1641.58 --> 1647.4299999999998
33 and and then I would say like yeah

1644.55 --> 1651.21
this look look you got this okay you got

1647.43 --> 1654.96
the gematria data now aren't you going

1651.21 --> 1658.3500000000001
to try to actually confirm any of it or

1654.96 --> 1661.98
are you just gonna find that you match

1658.35 --> 1664.7099999999998
your a stamp draw the conclusion black

1661.98 --> 1667.44
or white purely based on that geometry

1664.71 --> 1670.56
thing and then not look at anything else

1667.44 --> 1674.46
because I personally like the judge

1670.56 --> 1678.6
people judge like to learn about people

1674.46 --> 1680.91
by studying their behavior what are they

1678.6 --> 1684.2099999999998
talking about how are they behaving what

1680.91 --> 1687.1200000000001
do they want what do they carry out what

1684.21 --> 1690.99
are their fruits and that is how I judge

1687.12 --> 1693.87
them and not what some geometry a

1690.99 --> 1698.5
calculator says they're freaking numbers

1693.87 --> 1702.6999999999998
and the guy listen he come

1698.5 --> 1706.15
the rhombus bypassed its when I was

1702.7 --> 1708.73
saying that for over 20 minutes non-stop

1706.15 --> 1710.71
he was just waiting till I stopped

1708.73 --> 1713.08
talking about and then moving on to

1710.71 --> 1715.24
another subject and he kept on ramming

1713.08 --> 1719.289
it ramming ramming ramming

1715.24 --> 1723.21
he would not listen and I hate it I hate

1719.289 --> 1729.03
it when people do that it's so [ __ ]

1723.21 --> 1732.789
it is and I called it it is divination

1729.03 --> 1735.8799999999999
obsession because it is definition it is

1732.789 --> 1739.059
like sooth saying it is like reading the

1735.88 --> 1741.6100000000001
bones or reading the tea leaves it takes

1739.059 --> 1744.1
something an element of nature an

1741.61 --> 1748.12
element of reality itself and then

1744.1 --> 1750.2199999999998
trying to deduce some kind of ethereal

1748.12 --> 1752.9499999999998
conclusion from it and yeah there's

1750.22 --> 1757.48
things like the itching and it does that

1752.95 --> 1760.24
too very eloquently but yeah with

1757.48 --> 1763.1200000000001
divination if you get obsessed over it

1760.24 --> 1765.97
and you start to reflect everything on

1763.12 --> 1768.7299999999998
that form of definition and then you no

1765.97 --> 1770.679
longer pay attention to the actual world

1768.73 --> 1775.179
but only to the results of the

1770.679 --> 1778.47
definition then you will drown in it and

1775.179 --> 1785.98
you will lose yourself in it and I think

1778.47 --> 1789.76
that's even I can understand where you

1785.98 --> 1792.64
come in from with Eve people trying to

1789.76 --> 1794.4089999999999
move past point you know it's like

1792.64 --> 1797.679
conspiracy cats I'm gonna mention it

1794.409 --> 1799.929
because Nathan Oakley he's in this is in

1797.679 --> 1802.45
the chat how many times did you ask him

1799.929 --> 1803.289
about gas pressure without a container

1802.45 --> 1805.929
Nathan

1803.289 --> 1808.809
was it three hundred and odd I mean I

1805.929 --> 1810.0700000000002
remember even counting off and it was I

1808.809 --> 1810.9089999999999
remember I think the first started

1810.07 --> 1812.95
watching it when they were getting to

1810.909 --> 1815.38
about 70 and then I'm realizing that

1812.95 --> 1822.309
conspiracy cast is literally ignoring

1815.38 --> 1825.99
the question over 350 times that thick

1822.309 --> 1829.36
idiot with the ball head doesn't know

1825.99 --> 1831.29
the answer it doesn't know it well he

1829.36 --> 1833.81
wouldn't know the answer even if

1831.29 --> 1840.68
Laser tattooed it into his frontal

1833.81 --> 1841.52
cortex without the container that can be

1840.68 --> 1844.52
no pressure

1841.52 --> 1847.61
conspiracy caps 2019 yeah Wow he said

1844.52 --> 1850.01
that kind of that kind of screws your

1847.61 --> 1852.35
your globally essentially right now you

1850.01 --> 1855.26
should become a flat earther that's it

1852.35 --> 1856.6999999999998
babe all thanks no we don't need him

1855.26 --> 1863.08
yeah we wouldn't actually have him

1856.7 --> 1866.69
actually Manny he makes my skin crawl

1863.08 --> 1869.59
he yeah I mean literally voices

1866.69 --> 1872.93
presentation

1869.59 --> 1876.7099999999998
I get that more with fight to flatter

1872.93 --> 1879.2
that guy just really but yeah they all

1876.71 --> 1884.8700000000001
have their own creepiness and just like

1879.2 --> 1890.0800000000002
Tim Osman has is severe creepy gay

1884.87 --> 1890.08
undertones and they all have their own

1895.57 --> 1902.09
flat earth math that guy also has his

1899.39 --> 1905.3600000000001
creepy vibe they all have their freaky

1902.09 --> 1907.75
creepy things about them so I totally

1905.36 --> 1907.75
get that

1907.78 --> 1917.92
Tim Tim Osman is bundle four of Nathan's

1910.94 --> 1923.1200000000001
channels I should be is a spiteful vile

1917.92 --> 1926.39
demon no Nathan no Tim Hoffman but

1923.12 --> 1930.61
Nathan too but but for a devil Nathan is

1926.39 --> 1930.6100000000001
pretty amusing so I forgive him for that

1932.12 --> 1935.1999999999998
[Music]

1937.87 --> 1946.87
yeah but yeah I totally agree ghost

1944.48 --> 1952.07
Bracy cat so this is just

1946.87 --> 1954.35
just sad mostly I mean he teaches

1952.07 --> 1957.2
children I mean come mom let me suppose

1954.35 --> 1959.03
you're really doesn't really though I

1957.2 --> 1961.52
don't think so I don't think he could

1959.03 --> 1963.8899999999999
get employment could he really but I'd

1961.52 --> 1965.96
like to see some evidence you know you

1963.89 --> 1967.94
know I mean that's the evidence for the

1965.96 --> 1969.71
globe so where's the evidence that he

1967.94 --> 1972.5
actually is a school teacher because

1969.71 --> 1977.75
maybe he is just pretending to be I'd

1972.5 --> 1981.23
like to see some some students and him

1977.75 --> 1983.12
in school somebody look you can just ask

1981.23 --> 1984.8
your student yeah use your phone to

1983.12 --> 1987.26
record this or lifestream you know

1984.8 --> 1990.23
whatever you know there's no excuse that

1987.26 --> 1992.51
you can't do it with these students that

1990.23 --> 1995.72
are saying like yeah this is our teacher

1992.51 --> 1998.27
he gave us class in this in this year

1995.72 --> 2000.58
and this is the material he taught us

1998.27 --> 2003.25
you know I'd like to see some actual

2000.58 --> 2006.01
proof that he is a teacher because I

2003.25 --> 2009.25
don't think he is well I don't know he

2006.01 --> 2011.71
has a whiteboard and you know me oh I

2009.25 --> 2016.27
mean the whiteboard and he has a marker

2011.71 --> 2018.48
pen so I mean does he have a lab coat I

2016.27 --> 2020.95
haven't seen him in his lab coat no so

2018.48 --> 2024.04
but it definitely definitely has a

2020.95 --> 2025.6000000000001
whiteboard though and that must mean

2024.04 --> 2033.3999999999999
something when he gets here whiteboard

2025.6 --> 2040.53
out well you know I have a bow so that

2033.4 --> 2043.66
is my proof that I am an elf you know

2040.53 --> 2045.58
you don't have a bow I wonder what his

2043.66 --> 2048.58
name is in real life I mean it I don't

2045.58 --> 2052.21
think he looks like a Steve or a or a

2048.58 --> 2054.88
Mike or anything like that he looks a

2052.21 --> 2056.7400000000002
little more snively than that so you

2054.88 --> 2061.35
know what it reminds me of if we're

2056.74 --> 2066.8799999999997
gonna if we're gonna [ __ ] all over him

2061.35 --> 2068.56
but maybe he is like name again maybe he

2066.88 --> 2070.19
is Joe Rogan's

2068.56 --> 2071.7799999999997
[ __ ] little brother

2070.19 --> 2075.2000000000003
it kind of does look good like that

2071.78 --> 2081.7400000000002
don't you think he might be a Jeremy I

2075.2 --> 2084.02
could imagine him being a Jeremy Oh

2081.74 --> 2087.2299999999996
Jeremy I think something like that

2084.02 --> 2089.12
Jeremy Jeremy seems like a name that he

2087.23 --> 2091.91
could have you know for being a first

2089.12 --> 2093.5899999999997
name he doesn't look like a Steve he

2091.91 --> 2098.74
doesn't look like a Paul or anything

2093.59 --> 2105.4100000000003
like that anything yeah I don't think so

2098.74 --> 2109.43
I just know I find him barely worth the

2105.41 --> 2112.46
attention well I'm only I'm only worried

2109.43 --> 2115.58
anymore he knows he knows it he knows

2112.46 --> 2117.41
that I really don't give a [ __ ] and I

2115.58 --> 2121.25
really don't care what what his name is

2117.41 --> 2126.0699999999997
I just know that is deceitful and he

2121.25 --> 2128.57
lies and he is perhaps the worst globe

2126.07 --> 2130.46
person you should ever watch if he'd go

2128.57 --> 2132.26
in there to try and find actual proof

2130.46 --> 2135.7400000000002
because he lies me twist about

2132.26 --> 2138.11
everything he doesn't know how to do a

2135.74 --> 2139.8199999999997
balanced argument with anything you

2138.11 --> 2141.77
can't present him some evidence and ask

2139.82 --> 2143.4500000000003
him to be truthful with it because he

2141.77 --> 2143.9
won't do a who doesn't do stuff like

2143.45 --> 2146.8399999999997
that

2143.9 --> 2149.51
he's not like flat-earthers who will at

2146.84 --> 2150.98
least investigate what the scene he's

2149.51 --> 2158.63
not like globo's Iver

2150.98 --> 2160.45
he's very sloppy he's not meticulous he

2158.63 --> 2163.36
doesn't spell correctly either I mean

2160.45 --> 2168.5899999999997
yeah I mean really oh yeah and also he

2163.36 --> 2171.6200000000003
thinks he really is upset you Randy so

2168.59 --> 2175.6400000000003
he thinks that I think sorry I just you

2171.62 --> 2180.65
look in the chat he thinks you really

2175.64 --> 2184.1299999999997
upset you oh no no of course not but he

2180.65 --> 2186.08
thinks it that's just well I'm just

2184.13 --> 2188.75
gonna preserve my screen just for a

2186.08 --> 2195.29
minute I just let me let me know when

2188.75 --> 2199.31
I'm sharing okay so we've got conspiracy

2195.29 --> 2201.47
cat and when we type it in to look for

2199.31 --> 2203.109
the channel it says howdy

2201.47 --> 2208.089
capital H no fool

2203.109 --> 2212.589
stop so capital h howdy capital T the

2208.089 --> 2217.8089999999997
earth is not flat capital W water is not

2212.589 --> 2220.529
an element no full stop capital B breath

2217.809 --> 2223.989
and arianism is done no full stop

2220.529 --> 2225.73
capital what do we what else can I add

2223.989 --> 2228.43
to my list question mark so this is a

2225.73 --> 2230.7690000000002
guy that's supposed to teach this is a

2228.43 --> 2234.64
teacher and he there's no punctuation

2230.769 --> 2236.499
there he's got no no sentences is not

2234.64 --> 2239.68
key broken or something

2236.499 --> 2240.8799999999997
thank you must be it's no commas even

2239.68 --> 2242.529
there's no if you know if you were gonna

2240.88 --> 2244.42
make it into a long sentence and she'd

2242.529 --> 2246.39
break it down with commas but there's no

2244.42 --> 2250.809
commas there's no full stops just

2246.39 --> 2255.279
capital I mean howdy space capital T

2250.809 --> 2258.1600000000003
yeah what what was this guy doing I mean

2255.279 --> 2261.19
that's just water is not an element oh

2258.16 --> 2266.98
right right yet but I don't understand

2261.19 --> 2270.4
what like breath breatharianism what is

2266.98 --> 2274.9
this what is this beast with that oh my

2270.4 --> 2278.1600000000003
god how dare people survive not eating

2274.9 --> 2282.489
oh my god that must be stopped

2278.16 --> 2286.42
[ __ ] you know damn you can't not eat

2282.489 --> 2288.9990000000003
like okay look if somebody tries that

2286.42 --> 2291.4300000000003
and they fail yeah they're gonna be

2288.999 --> 2294.97
eating again and oh okay yeah they fail

2291.43 --> 2297.3999999999996
but like why would you object to that

2294.97 --> 2300.029
you know not saying like yeah there's

2297.4 --> 2303.009
other problems some people may have like

2300.029 --> 2306.309
anorexia that kind of thing that is

2303.009 --> 2309.97
problematic routed in psychology but

2306.309 --> 2313.0890000000004
yeah breathe Arianism is not really a

2309.97 --> 2318.3999999999996
teenage thing it's usually something

2313.089 --> 2320.8289999999997
that people may try like well yeah well

2318.4 --> 2322.7490000000003
halfway their life or something because

2320.829 --> 2325.509
you're not men you're not gonna be

2322.749 --> 2327.9599999999996
mentally ready for any of that when

2325.509 --> 2327.96
you're young

2328.839 --> 2335.8289999999997
yeah maybe won't stuff so hmm

2333.13 --> 2339.309
yeah he cooked off my icon so it looks

2335.829 --> 2341.799
between us there the guy was better yeah

2339.309 --> 2346.029
so I mean this guy is supposed to be

2341.799 --> 2347.529
marking kids homework and stuff I mean

2346.029 --> 2351.67
he can't even string a sentence together

2347.529 --> 2354.069
so all right oh I wanna respond for a

2351.67 --> 2356.6800000000003
moment it crispy receipt gets do you

2354.069 --> 2357.759
know how many people died listening to

2356.68 --> 2361.2
breatharians

2357.759 --> 2368.619
well do you know how many people died

2361.2 --> 2371.979
playing World of Warcraft officially you

2368.619 --> 2375.009
know good I don't know but I know it's

2371.979 --> 2378.0989999999997
more than one so how do you even know

2375.009 --> 2380.95
people died listening to birth arianism

2378.099 --> 2383.6800000000003
I don't get it you know how can you die

2380.95 --> 2386.859
from listening to a breatharian that

2383.68 --> 2389.799
doesn't make any sense you might die

2386.859 --> 2393.219
from being too fanatical when you

2389.799 --> 2395.44
actually try it out yourself what how

2393.219 --> 2398.9790000000003
can you die from listening to a

2395.44 --> 2403.9500000000003
breatharian how many people died

2398.979 --> 2407.2
listening to a flat earther Oh Nathan

2403.95 --> 2409.66
Nathan Nathan Nathan Nathan you're in

2407.2 --> 2413.3799999999997
the chat my friend look at baldi couch

2409.66 --> 2415.96
channel he has a new video out talking

2413.38 --> 2417.789
about volume and gas might be

2415.96 --> 2422.38
interesting to you thanks only put out

2417.789 --> 2427.239
14 hours ago let me know if you've

2422.38 --> 2435.579
already said in the video they should be

2427.239 --> 2438.279
for me well I think that I think that

2435.579 --> 2443.2290000000003
we've given him enough attend enough to

2438.279 --> 2445.66
draw attention for now you think so yeah

2443.229 --> 2448.93
he's a look he's just riding along my

2445.66 --> 2454.569
channel he's actually like it yeah like

2448.93 --> 2458.6189999999997
a [ __ ] vampire idiots just trying to

2454.569 --> 2460.69
now leech off my viewers and people will

2458.619 --> 2462.15
actually probably look at him because

2460.69 --> 2465.63
somebody's talking

2462.15 --> 2468.96
about him well if nobody would then he

2465.63 --> 2472.859
would literally fizzle and die out and

2468.96 --> 2475.049
just end up in the gutter somewhere so

2472.859 --> 2483.799
maybe we should just stop talking about

2475.049 --> 2488.819
it okay but so did you say Russian vids

2483.799 --> 2493.559
last night on Patricia's yeah yeah sleep

2488.819 --> 2496.68
halfway it it was good and it sucked as

2493.559 --> 2503.039
well so I've been very divided about

2496.68 --> 2509.39
Russian vid and I think it's a big

2503.039 --> 2512.039
following oh I'm sure he does what I

2509.39 --> 2517.6189999999997
don't know he's too much into gematria

2512.039 --> 2520.23
and that's a bad sign it's also the one

2517.619 --> 2524.7000000000003
thing I absolutely despise about crowd

2520.23 --> 2526.89
triple7 you know I pretty much end up

2524.7 --> 2531.359
despising everyone that gets obsessed

2526.89 --> 2535.46
with gematria also if you had paid some

2531.359 --> 2539.22
real attention and to Jamaa trieste s--

2535.46 --> 2542.7
themselves they always do the same [ __ ]

2539.22 --> 2545.819
they always do the same [ __ ] they take

2542.7 --> 2550.0789999999997
somebody's name or something and then

2545.819 --> 2553.46
it's all look but if you slightly change

2550.079 --> 2557.279
it oh then the number comes out it's

2553.46 --> 2561.119
total horseshit and I'm like literally

2557.279 --> 2564.45
embarrassed to death that people aren't

2561.119 --> 2567.119
like pointing fingers at them at that

2564.45 --> 2570.27
very moment like this is [ __ ] what

2567.119 --> 2570.9900000000002
you're doing this absolute Carnival

2570.27 --> 2574.71
level

2570.99 --> 2577.47
[ __ ] you can't do gematria and then

2574.71 --> 2579.0
for your convenience is like alter

2577.47 --> 2582.25
something all right under everyone's

2579.0 --> 2587.2
nose to make it fit

2582.25 --> 2592.39
numbered prophecy [ __ ]

2587.2 --> 2596.109
Oh [ __ ] and if anything look if

2592.39 --> 2600.31
anything with the Freemasons and all

2596.109 --> 2601.93
that you know yeah they may be doing

2600.31 --> 2604.96
gematria stuff

2601.93 --> 2608.3199999999997
you know why because people get obsessed

2604.96 --> 2610.75
with it and they start losing their

2608.32 --> 2612.119
minds and start losing focus on what

2610.75 --> 2615.849
actually is going on

2612.119 --> 2618.359
it's the fence mechanism gematria for

2615.849 --> 2620.8900000000003
you programming things with gematria

2618.359 --> 2623.02
because they do it on purpose it's not

2620.89 --> 2627.43
an accident it's not a mandate they do

2623.02 --> 2630.7599999999998
it on purpose to cause people to lose

2627.43 --> 2632.859
themselves in it to not to end up not

2630.76 --> 2634.9300000000003
looking at the actual content and

2632.859 --> 2638.59
information but to lose themselves in

2634.93 --> 2640.72
the geometry aspect and lose track it's

2638.59 --> 2643.9500000000003
actually a psychological defense

2640.72 --> 2647.73
mechanism that they put there on purpose

2643.95 --> 2651.0099999999998
that's my theory about your material

2647.73 --> 2653.349
what do you think about people looking

2651.01 --> 2659.4700000000003
into all the stuff like old history and

2653.349 --> 2664.81
such well that's perfectly natural

2659.47 --> 2668.89
I agree the history is a default vegan

2664.81 --> 2670.57
warrior I had the misfortune of stepping

2668.89 --> 2673.359
on his channel within the last week to

2670.57 --> 2675.31
just watch probably 15 minutes that I

2673.359 --> 2678.13
can never get back in my life

2675.31 --> 2680.23
it was him attacking barb and glow

2678.13 --> 2682.9
Buster's for putting Martin legally on

2680.23 --> 2685.119
the channel well if you think that glow

2682.9 --> 2687.31
Buster's is just about proving the shape

2685.119 --> 2690.19
of the earth it could be encompassed

2687.31 --> 2692.859
more than that you're talking about how

2690.19 --> 2695.05
it was able to get into the minds of

2692.859 --> 2697.48
people how it was able to be put there

2695.05 --> 2700.0
and that is through false history and if

2697.48 --> 2701.95
if people like vegan warrior are gonna

2700.0 --> 2704.95
call Bob out for putting Martin leaky on

2701.95 --> 2706.8999999999996
who let me say Martin leafy has been

2704.95 --> 2709.0299999999997
unflattering

2706.9 --> 2710.9500000000003
he was actually doing a show with the

2709.03 --> 2713.77
morgue out before this vegan warrior was

2710.95 --> 2715.54
even on flat right no he's one of the

2713.77 --> 2719.17
first first

2715.54 --> 2721.69
yes yes exactly so vegan warrior calling

2719.17 --> 2724.86
out Martin Leakey and Bob for him going

2721.69 --> 2726.7000000000003
on the show it needs a kick in the face

2724.86 --> 2729.25
literally it needs a kick in the face

2726.7 --> 2732.37
because he's he's causing he's causing

2729.25 --> 2734.83
[ __ ] inside of the Flat Earth when we

2732.37 --> 2735.19
don't need it we have enough problems as

2734.83 --> 2737.59
it is

2735.19 --> 2740.53
tackling the globe and the censorship in

2737.59 --> 2742.3900000000003
YouTube without people with a channel I

2740.53 --> 2744.25
have no idea how many subscribers his

2742.39 --> 2747.46
body he's getting about a thousand views

2744.25 --> 2750.61
so I'm gonna assume he has probably 1500

2747.46 --> 2754.3
2000 subscribers so he has got a reach

2750.61 --> 2755.9500000000003
but this is the type of thing that we

2754.3 --> 2758.26
thought we'd got over with in the last

2755.95 --> 2760.4199999999996
two years the infighting which was the

2758.26 --> 2762.6400000000003
infighting never gonna happen Randy no

2760.42 --> 2766.1800000000003
no I know you will never know over the

2762.64 --> 2768.1
infighting people will always eventually

2766.18 --> 2774.73
start to turn to infighting

2768.1 --> 2779.0499999999997
when they lose grip yeah it's it's

2774.73 --> 2782.14
exactly what what conspiracy cap tards

2779.05 --> 2784.51
that is doing in chat yeah I mean this

2782.14 --> 2786.2799999999997
weekend warrior he has no real stuff on

2784.51 --> 2787.75
his channel of no you know there's

2786.28 --> 2790.8100000000004
nothing that he's brought to the table

2787.75 --> 2793.54
essentially vegan warrior yeah no I

2790.81 --> 2795.22
disagree you know he's done a lot of

2793.54 --> 2799.71
good thing I've been on this channel

2795.22 --> 2803.7999999999997
yeah with him but it's not his focus is

2799.71 --> 2806.71
not so much it's just a side note to him

2803.8 --> 2808.21
he is very much about media operations

2806.71 --> 2810.91
and false flags and he's done some

2808.21 --> 2813.2200000000003
amazing things with that and has

2810.91 --> 2815.46
actually been his channel has been

2813.22 --> 2819.73
deleted numerous times

2815.46 --> 2821.62
what who brought fire because he covered

2819.73 --> 2824.46
false jobs in the moment they happened

2821.62 --> 2827.5299999999997
did spot-on analysis and he has a police

2824.46 --> 2830.35
background so he has more knowledge

2827.53 --> 2832.69
about the codes of conducts how these

2830.35 --> 2836.02
things work I think I always thought he

2832.69 --> 2840.28
was a valuable part of the community but

2836.02 --> 2843.0099999999998
I guess he's turning to infighting for

2840.28 --> 2844.48
some reason that's yeah go down that

2843.01 --> 2846.9100000000003
route if he's gonna go down that route

2844.48 --> 2848.11
just to train it stay relevant like I'm

2846.91 --> 2849.3999999999996
saying I'm looking at each channel I

2848.11 --> 2852.9100000000003
don't see anything

2849.4 --> 2855.01
they eat out that's helping flatter well

2852.91 --> 2856.6
that's probably because what is put out

2855.01 --> 2858.8500000000004
is just what he's been doing recently

2856.6 --> 2862.6
because all his old stuff has all been

2858.85 --> 2864.13
destroyed been deleted by YouTube you

2862.6 --> 2868.96
said it was conspiracy theories that he

2864.13 --> 2871.96
was going on about no media false flag

2868.96 --> 2874.54
operations the moment they happen like

2871.96 --> 2877.3
it comes on the news he studies it he

2874.54 --> 2880.96
makes a video almost immediately very

2877.3 --> 2883.6600000000003
elaborately is good at that so how's

2880.96 --> 2885.73
about Flat Earth and the technicalities

2883.66 --> 2892.5
of that well what's he brought to fly

2885.73 --> 2895.15
this though not much just a stance

2892.5 --> 2897.28
doesn't matter to me

2895.15 --> 2898.9900000000002
it must me it matters to me when he's

2897.28 --> 2902.4700000000003
gonna go around slacking off Martin

2898.99 --> 2905.29
Leakey who's literally opening our eyes

2902.47 --> 2907.54
to a whole new history that we we didn't

2905.29 --> 2909.04
even know about that quite a lot of it

2907.54 --> 2910.84
we can go and visit ourselves like the

2909.04 --> 2913.63
star ports things that we have never

2910.84 --> 2915.46
even heard of and I'm you know in my

2913.63 --> 2917.29
forties I'd never heard of a star fort

2915.46 --> 2919.09
until Martin leak he told me about them

2917.29 --> 2921.2799999999997
and suddenly they're all over the place

2919.09 --> 2923.38
well I haven't we been taught about

2921.28 --> 2926.0800000000004
these and we have this guy saying you

2923.38 --> 2928.1800000000003
shouldn't look into history and bring

2926.08 --> 2930.67
Martin leak T on the globe bluster [ __ ]

2928.18 --> 2934.24
like he has a part to say anything in it

2930.67 --> 2937.08
he has no it has no horse in the race as

2934.24 --> 2939.64
far as I'm concerned it is kind of silly

2937.08 --> 2945.58
yeah to make a big deal out of it I

2939.64 --> 2946.42
don't know you know look not to step on

2945.58 --> 2949.27
anybody's toes

2946.42 --> 2951.76
but Martin Lathika yeah he has amazing

2949.27 --> 2954.7599999999998
works and he has amazing sources and he

2951.76 --> 2958.0600000000004
has a research community basically

2954.76 --> 2960.34
behind him and it's very impressive but

2958.06 --> 2963.43
he also jumps

2960.34 --> 2966.06
some serious conclusions here and there

2963.43 --> 2969.43
and tends to over generalize very

2966.06 --> 2971.86
noticeably and that sometimes annoys the

2969.43 --> 2974.2
[ __ ] out of it out of me and I actually

2971.86 --> 2976.96
criticized him on the spot

2974.2 --> 2978.9399999999996
in chat when I think he does it because

2976.96 --> 2981.5
he did actually here and there bring

2978.94 --> 2983.6
some ridiculous Photoshop

2981.5 --> 2987.86
images in there and then called it proof

2983.6 --> 2990.47
it's obviously not so he he has amazing

2987.86 --> 2994.48
works but he does get sloppy here and

2990.47 --> 2998.93
there and he does seem to be trying to

2994.48 --> 3000.76
write a story rather than be absolutely

2998.93 --> 3003.25
accurate about these things which is

3000.76 --> 3005.8300000000004
required because look the the hidden

3003.25 --> 3009.37
history is extremely complex and we are

3005.83 --> 3012.22
only gonna get fragments of it and when

3009.37 --> 3014.2
you then convolute those fragments it's

3012.22 --> 3016.3599999999997
only gonna make things worse it's gonna

3014.2 --> 3019.93
make things more confusing and I dislike

3016.36 --> 3023.71
that about him so that's a note of

3019.93 --> 3027.04
criticism and critical there because you

3023.71 --> 3031.57
know I watch his stuff and when he's

3027.04 --> 3034.06
decided for in what is shown immediately

3031.57 --> 3035.4100000000003
turns a page and he will be oh yeah

3034.06 --> 3036.91
there's that symbol there there's this

3035.41 --> 3038.44
symbol there that means this this means

3036.91 --> 3041.68
that look at the dresses the way and

3038.44 --> 3043.69
look at it you know he's brain because

3041.68 --> 3046.5699999999997
he studied it for so long he knows

3043.69 --> 3049.12
exactly what he's like he can look at an

3046.57 --> 3051.9100000000003
image and it might as well be a book or

3049.12 --> 3055.75
a page of a book and he could be sad for

3051.91 --> 3057.91
what he's looking at and it's just who

3055.75 --> 3062.17
is through his experience he's able to

3057.91 --> 3063.7
do that well so I can do that I can okay

3062.17 --> 3065.98
I'm very good at that

3063.7 --> 3069.22
I throw these things out and he is

3065.98 --> 3071.8
sometimes jumping to conclusions and you

3069.22 --> 3077.77
don't really see it you just got you you

3071.8 --> 3083.77
seem to trust him I do trust him right

3077.77 --> 3089.11
well I trust him to be a good person to

3083.77 --> 3092.52
have no negative intentions towards his

3089.11 --> 3096.31
audience but I do not trust him to be

3092.52 --> 3098.77
perfectly correct absolutely not

3096.31 --> 3101.02
I've noticed recognize takes over the

3098.77 --> 3106.6
place it's more correct than the history

3101.02 --> 3108.52
we've been told well yeah well our Flat

3106.6 --> 3111.46
Earth model is a better model than the

3108.52 --> 3114.64
globe model but this is the thing this

3111.46 --> 3115.96
vegan warrior is basically saying let's

3114.64 --> 3121.0589999999997
leave everything that we know about

3115.96 --> 3124.029
history now what do you say but it is it

3121.059 --> 3126.4300000000003
is childish it is stupid to do that I

3124.029 --> 3129.7
agree with that it's nonsense it's

3126.43 --> 3132.609
infighting and in the end of the day

3129.7 --> 3134.6499999999996
it's completely useless to do that it's

3132.609 --> 3136.5389999999998
better to criticize somebody with

3134.65 --> 3138.849
something that's actually wrong about

3136.539 --> 3143.1400000000003
what they do rather than just say oh

3138.849 --> 3145.9500000000003
that person is bad you know that's

3143.14 --> 3149.89
stupid and yeah

3145.95 --> 3152.41
bringing alternative history to the

3149.89 --> 3157.0
attention of people is a very important

3152.41 --> 3160.2889999999998
thing for us all and Martin Ithaca

3157.0 --> 3165.279
serves that function by exposing us to

3160.289 --> 3167.44
hidden materials but be careful in how

3165.279 --> 3170.74
you're gonna interpret those materials

3167.44 --> 3173.44
don't jump to conclusions because you

3170.74 --> 3177.25
want to see the structure you want it

3173.44 --> 3180.4
all to fit immediately that's jumping to

3177.25 --> 3182.289
conclusions it's okay so how would you

3180.4 --> 3183.819
describe yourself from fighters would

3182.289 --> 3195.579
you say you're more of a flat earth

3183.819 --> 3199.329
philosopher yeah I don't know I am I'm a

3195.579 --> 3202.539
Cosmo genius i I think in world design

3199.329 --> 3206.0190000000002
and options and I'd use presuppositional

3202.539 --> 3209.2000000000003
reasons reasoning to figure out

3206.019 --> 3212.0789999999997
potential possibilities that's what I

3209.2 --> 3215.859
seem to be doing that is one of my most

3212.079 --> 3218.1090000000004
unique qualities in the scene and other

3215.859 --> 3220.99
than that I just try to be a

3218.109 --> 3224.2
common-sense good person try to be as

3220.99 --> 3228.6699999999996
honest and open as I can and try to

3224.2 --> 3230.2889999999998
reflect that honesty on my audience so

3228.67 --> 3232.75
would you say that you have a better

3230.289 --> 3236.9100000000003
outlook on that the Masen lately

3232.75 --> 3240.25
I don't think Martin littke is really

3236.91 --> 3241.39
focusing on those things exactly exactly

3240.25 --> 3244.06
that's my point

3241.39 --> 3245.74
Arwen is that you know you can

3244.06 --> 3249.13
specialize in one thing

3245.74 --> 3251.41
Martin another Nathan in a different

3249.13 --> 3253.33
Anthony Riley in another everybody has

3251.41 --> 3255.58
their own skill set that they bring you

3253.33 --> 3257.65
know everybody every single person and

3255.58 --> 3259.48
this is what I'm finding it's like

3257.65 --> 3261.61
everybody has their own niche that they

3259.48 --> 3264.88
took in to write the meaning it's the

3261.61 --> 3266.53
horizon I've not looked at anything else

3264.88 --> 3268.84
it's literally just been the horizon my

3266.53 --> 3270.76
entire channel and everything I've

3268.84 --> 3272.2000000000003
learned about flyest is based upon what

3270.76 --> 3274.3300000000004
we see at the horizon that's it

3272.2 --> 3275.95
you know so if you ask me about

3274.33 --> 3277.87
something else I'll point you to

3275.95 --> 3280.54
somebody else that might know that the

3277.87 --> 3281.77
answer to that book it's not necessarily

3280.54 --> 3282.97
gonna be me but if you want to talk

3281.77 --> 3285.46
about the horizon what can talk about

3282.97 --> 3287.02
the horizon for sure and just like I say

3285.46 --> 3290.02
with Martin and stuff with the work he

3287.02 --> 3292.33
does he originally was a flat earth who

3290.02 --> 3294.97
still is a flat earther from 2% flat

3292.33 --> 3298.0299999999997
earther but he found that his niche was

3294.97 --> 3300.31
in history right and that's what he's

3298.03 --> 3303.1600000000003
specializes in and now he's taken his

3300.31 --> 3305.41
Flat Earth British into that domain and

3303.16 --> 3307.06
he's now educating and he's speaking

3305.41 --> 3308.56
about Flat Earth to all the people in

3307.06 --> 3310.63
history and he's bringing more people in

3308.56 --> 3312.4
that way so he's doing his own activism

3310.63 --> 3315.06
he's doing his own research and he's

3312.4 --> 3317.31
actually bringing more attention and

3315.06 --> 3319.84
results to the Flat Earth and

3317.31 --> 3322.7799999999997
everybody's got their own little niches

3319.84 --> 3325.75
it's just the way it is I don't think

3322.78 --> 3327.9700000000003
criticizing people for that you know

3325.75 --> 3329.47
should you know it unless you have that

3327.97 --> 3332.1
you think you have a better knowledge

3329.47 --> 3336.24
than them you should really support them

3332.1 --> 3340.71
well I do support him but I also I also

3336.24 --> 3343.89
try to caution people like it's

3340.71 --> 3349.27
sometimes overwhelming and puzzling and

3343.89 --> 3352.5099999999998
don't let the sensation railroad you

3349.27 --> 3354.94
into another blind trust because you

3352.51 --> 3358.9900000000002
don't know and Martin doesn't really

3354.94 --> 3361.63
know totally he has some ideas he has

3358.99 --> 3364.12
theories about how it all is working and

3361.63 --> 3365.33
yeah it may be definitely on the right

3364.12 --> 3369.02
track

3365.33 --> 3370.49
partially so when you when you article

3369.02 --> 3372.23
slam and you was talking about the

3370.49 --> 3374.9799999999996
optical slam until somebody actually

3372.23 --> 3377.32
proved it it was just a theory correct

3374.98 --> 3380.21
it took somebody to go out and actually

3377.32 --> 3382.55
put it down for you so that you know you

3380.21 --> 3385.15
know you could see it happening and you

3382.55 --> 3387.53
could analyze it and then it obviously

3385.15 --> 3391.73
validated your theory on that

3387.53 --> 3394.46
well well the optical slam theory came

3391.73 --> 3396.62
after the footage first the footage came

3394.46 --> 3398.69
I studied the footage then I saw

3396.62 --> 3401.45
correlations and then I thought wait

3398.69 --> 3403.37
this is what I'm seeing it's an optical

3401.45 --> 3406.25
slant that's how it worked I didn't

3403.37 --> 3410.3599999999997
think of the theory and then start and

3406.25 --> 3413.42
now it what probably 14 16 months of

3410.36 --> 3415.67
research you know all all over the place

3413.42 --> 3418.54
that has actually validated that so now

3415.67 --> 3422.87
that we know that this is in effect and

3418.54 --> 3425.18
flatness can take that and use that even

3422.87 --> 3427.67
if you termed it optical slump original

3425.18 --> 3428.6299999999997
right well Martin Leith is the same you

3427.67 --> 3430.46
know I mean if you think that he knows

3428.63 --> 3432.38
everything about everything you might

3430.46 --> 3434.81
have an idea about it but it might take

3432.38 --> 3437.69
six months or a year or two years for

3434.81 --> 3439.52
him to get the the books or the date or

3437.69 --> 3441.92
come across something that ties

3439.52 --> 3444.74
everything together but on his journey

3441.92 --> 3447.77
he already knows essentially where it's

3444.74 --> 3451.04
going and you know he has a direction

3447.77 --> 3452.6
that he's being shown the direction and

3451.04 --> 3455.06
he's talking about the direction whether

3452.6 --> 3457.16
or not he can prove it concrete right

3455.06 --> 3460.07
now 100% everything that he's talking

3457.16 --> 3463.0699999999997
about probably not but give it two years

3460.07 --> 3464.42
of more research and there's every

3463.07 --> 3467.8700000000003
opportunity that that is what's gonna

3464.42 --> 3469.58
happen what I'm saying is you can't you

3467.87 --> 3470.3199999999997
know if he if unless you're on that

3469.58 --> 3472.91
journey

3470.32 --> 3474.8300000000004
try not to critique him because when I

3472.91 --> 3476.75
was on the journey about the horizon I

3474.83 --> 3479.06
had a lot of critique from Flat Earth

3476.75 --> 3481.79
there's as well as bloggers right but it

3479.06 --> 3484.07
didn't stop me and now well everybody's

3481.79 --> 3485.7799999999997
talking about it which is great yeah so

3484.07 --> 3487.4
now it's now we're not frightened to

3485.78 --> 3490.1000000000004
talk about the horizon but when I first

3487.4 --> 3492.86
started doing it I got a lot of [ __ ]

3490.1 --> 3494.99
basically from all the flat earthers

3492.86 --> 3498.11
don't show this what you do we know

3494.99 --> 3498.5989999999997
you're a shill little you're a pole all

3498.11 --> 3501.599
this

3498.599 --> 3506.94
yeah I got the same thing from you guys

3501.599 --> 3508.4990000000003
even what I'm saying so when I was

3506.94 --> 3510.21
getting that obviously I acted

3508.499 --> 3513.029
differently I carried on plodding on

3510.21 --> 3514.68
that's where I needed to be but you know

3513.029 --> 3516.69
I mean just what you were saying before

3514.68 --> 3519.18
that you don't trust him on everything

3516.69 --> 3521.759
you know you don't have to trust you

3519.18 --> 3523.049
just literally have to listen and then

3521.759 --> 3524.67
you have to take it in and you have to

3523.049 --> 3526.65
understand that he's on the journey and

3524.67 --> 3528.4500000000003
if you follow him you will he will take

3526.65 --> 3532.4100000000003
you where the journey takes him mm-hmm

3528.45 --> 3534.749
right but I will be that kid that points

3532.41 --> 3538.14
are the mistakes I always done that I'd

3534.749 --> 3541.3689999999997
then done that in class in school every

3538.14 --> 3545.0389999999998
education I've ever been art classes

3541.369 --> 3547.0190000000002
physics I always point like when a

3545.039 --> 3548.67
teacher is explaining something or

3547.019 --> 3551.97
somebody showing something and they're

3548.67 --> 3553.9500000000003
making a mistake and everybody seems to

3551.97 --> 3557.339
glance over it I'm the one that's gonna

3553.95 --> 3559.68
point out no that is wrong you're making

3557.339 --> 3561.63
a mistake here you might not even do it

3559.68 --> 3565.41
intentionally but that's mistaken

3561.63 --> 3569.4
because I can because I see it and I'm

3565.41 --> 3572.0389999999998
not saying don't trust Martin because

3569.4 --> 3575.9990000000003
he's not trustworthy no he is but he's

3572.039 --> 3579.4790000000003
just he does things wrong sometimes it's

3575.999 --> 3582.7189999999996
just no other way to say it yeah that's

3579.479 --> 3585.989
all but that doesn't take away the value

3582.719 --> 3589.219
of what he is presenting it's just I

3585.989 --> 3592.68
guess his way of telling the story

3589.219 --> 3594.359
something well essentially we're all on

3592.68 --> 3596.6699999999996
the same journey this is it I mean

3594.359 --> 3597.9
everybody's on the journey and

3596.67 --> 3600.69
everybody's bringing a little bit of

3597.9 --> 3602.7290000000003
knowledge to the table and then it just

3600.69 --> 3604.65
so happens that some people get drawn

3602.729 --> 3606.359
into a certain aspect of something that

3604.65 --> 3608.849
interests them and then the research

3606.359 --> 3611.219
that even more and more they told me for

3608.849 --> 3614.9990000000003
instance it was going to uni you know

3611.219 --> 3616.529
and going for his master's you know so I

3614.999 --> 3617.8489999999997
mean that's something completely

3616.529 --> 3619.979
different than nobody else that thought

3617.849 --> 3622.17
about doing what he had the opportunity

3619.979 --> 3623.9689999999996
to do that and he's gone for that so you

3622.17 --> 3625.529
know when everybody Nathan for instance

3623.969 --> 3628.529
with the debates I mean he picked a

3625.529 --> 3630.719
format that works works really well and

3628.529 --> 3633.27
now he's taken the e as a very good

3630.719 --> 3635.83
brain for remember

3633.27 --> 3638.35
you know he's taken that knowledge and

3635.83 --> 3639.94
now he can he can debate people if you

3638.35 --> 3641.47
want somebody to debate you'd bring

3639.94 --> 3643.2400000000002
Nathan absolutely you know you wouldn't

3641.47 --> 3644.89
if you're gonna ask somebody to bring it

3643.24 --> 3647.02
with you bait yeah bring Nathan

3644.89 --> 3648.64
hopefully he's the guy for you you know

3647.02 --> 3650.62
and everybody's gonna specialize in the

3648.64 --> 3652.18
wrong way Bob with his gyroscope perhaps

3650.62 --> 3655.21
let's just say that because he seems to

3652.18 --> 3656.23
know an awful lot about gyroscopes and

3655.21 --> 3657.67
I'm sure enough person will fall out

3656.23 --> 3659.67
about more but there are people that

3657.67 --> 3662.02
specialize in this store

3659.67 --> 3670.12
all right everybody else everybody

3662.02 --> 3673.33
brings a bit to the table look widen it

3670.12 --> 3676.15
get do check his channel every single

3673.33 --> 3678.94
thing every single time he does a video

3676.15 --> 3681.79
I will be watching it and I will be

3678.94 --> 3685.78
commenting it and I will be blowing my

3681.79 --> 3689.85
mind as I do so but I will also very

3685.78 --> 3691.9300000000003
likely end up at some point saying oh no

3689.85 --> 3694.81
you're wrong about this

3691.93 --> 3696.39
that's wrong because that's what I do I

3694.81 --> 3699.94
must do it

3696.39 --> 3705.31
it's spiritually mandated for me to do

3699.94 --> 3707.02
that because it does help and let's give

3705.31 --> 3711.73
a few chefs house we've got Karen B

3707.02 --> 3713.55
she's in hello Karen Iser been a while

3711.73 --> 3716.76
since I've spoken to either actually

3713.55 --> 3724.9900000000002
how come he doesn't join the panel he's

3716.76 --> 3725.59
Lisa yeah Lisa's in the house the plain

3724.99 --> 3729.7299999999996
truth

3725.59 --> 3732.46
you should join on yeah yeah look

3729.73 --> 3736.27
anybody wants to join here except a lady

3732.46 --> 3739.71
kats then yeah you're welcome to join le

3736.27 --> 3739.71
beads in the house Chalky's in the house

3740.52 --> 3744.9
anybody what a link

3752.29 --> 3757.54
I put out the link in the early bird and

3755.08 --> 3764.02
in the master bee chats so they should

3757.54 --> 3765.55
all be able to join I think everyone

3764.02 --> 3769.3
should go over to Ally Beach Channel and

3765.55 --> 3771.04
subscribe as well because I think he

3769.3 --> 3773.23
only has about 300 subscribers I can't

3771.04 --> 3775.18
understand it and hardly anybody really

3773.23 --> 3777.16
watches his stuff which is frustrating

3775.18 --> 3779.3799999999997
really because he's there's a very nice

3777.16 --> 3780.8799999999997
man arisen about the way he actually

3779.38 --> 3783.88
presents his stuff and talks about

3780.88 --> 3790.96
things so surprised he hasn't actually

3783.88 --> 3793.54
got a lot more subscribers than that on

3790.96 --> 3796.63
l2 246 they must be messing around with

3793.54 --> 3806.74
this channel because they should have

3796.63 --> 3809.32
far more not but anyway I'd like to go a

3806.74 --> 3813.1
little bit more in content about Martin

3809.32 --> 3820.0
because work and that is when he talks

3813.1 --> 3823.21
about the Phoenicians oh right so you

3820.0 --> 3827.43
know great the Phoenicians

3823.21 --> 3834.94
versus the Tarte Aryans the two main

3827.43 --> 3837.73
cultural divisions that is huge and very

3834.94 --> 3841.21
true and once you actually look into the

3837.73 --> 3846.91
icon of iconography and be just the

3841.21 --> 3849.79
looks of these figures you will start to

3846.91 --> 3854.22
see echoes throughout modern day culture

3849.79 --> 3857.64
even and yeah some heavy heavy

3854.22 --> 3861.06
synchronicity was unleashed on me after

3857.64 --> 3863.89
seeing some of those icons just

3861.06 --> 3868.08
realizations that I don't even want to

3863.89 --> 3872.7999999999997
throw out there because it's just like

3868.08 --> 3875.11
it is kind of scary but yeah that the

3872.8 --> 3879.13
main thing seems to be the Phoenicians

3875.11 --> 3882.2000000000003
that cultural type that group it's not

3879.13 --> 3885.71
even an empire it's just a culture

3882.2 --> 3888.35
versus the tartarean culture which was

3885.71 --> 3891.8
worldwide and the Phoenicians what they

3888.35 --> 3893.8399999999997
did and how they did it and if you learn

3891.8 --> 3897.98
about that then you'll know that history

3893.84 --> 3900.4700000000003
is repeating itself in utter detail with

3897.98 --> 3905.27
the same methodology and the same

3900.47 --> 3907.8799999999997
psychological processes that these

3905.27 --> 3911.39
peoples went through in the past and

3907.88 --> 3914.87
I've started to realize like how did the

3911.39 --> 3918.89
Phoenicians actually destroy the turret

3914.87 --> 3921.7999999999997
Ariens how did they do it and I get it

3918.89 --> 3925.8199999999997
now I know how they did it they did it

3921.8 --> 3929.6000000000004
by poisoning their minds and poisoning

3925.82 --> 3933.53
their bodies and then let the poison do

3929.6 --> 3937.3399999999997
the destruction they made them destroy

3933.53 --> 3944.69
themselves by poisoning their minds with

3937.34 --> 3947.0
concepts and ideas and well that's I

3944.69 --> 3948.89
think vegan warrior is that that he

3947.0 --> 3952.1
didn't believe that the tart Aryans were

3948.89 --> 3957.1099999999997
in the Tartars were even or Tartarian it

3952.1 --> 3960.0499999999997
was even a any kind of world power or

3957.11 --> 3963.4300000000003
even existed he literally says there is

3960.05 --> 3966.05
all [ __ ] right oh yeah and that's

3963.43 --> 3969.58
completely wrong well it's it's

3966.05 --> 3973.28
confusing like I am not even completely

3969.58 --> 3976.64
settled on what the tart Aryans really

3973.28 --> 3981.4900000000002
were there is obviously very much so as

3976.64 --> 3985.16
a Empire in Russia that was tart area

3981.49 --> 3989.75
but there is just more to it

3985.16 --> 3992.66
look you have to compare it to how

3989.75 --> 3996.68
things work in the modern day because in

3992.66 --> 4000.1
the past those cultures had their own

3996.68 --> 4003.0099999999998
modern day if you think that the concept

4000.1 --> 4006.79
of having countries and then spreading

4003.01 --> 4010.1800000000003
out and mixing in with other cultures

4006.79 --> 4011.41
and getting bigger group contracts is

4010.18 --> 4014.5299999999997
something the rule

4011.41 --> 4017.3799999999997
happens from the 20th century on you're

4014.53 --> 4019.78
wrong you're absolutely fundamentally

4017.38 --> 4022.9
wrong and you're totally deluded to

4019.78 --> 4026.289
think that that just doesn't happen

4022.9 --> 4029.65
naturally every single time with every

4026.289 --> 4033.789
Empire as it looms up so I think that

4029.65 --> 4036.549
Tarte area may not have been like this

4033.789 --> 4040.079
conceptualized a roman empire that had

4036.549 --> 4044.2599999999998
settlements everywhere maybe not that

4040.079 --> 4048.25
but absolutely their cultural influence

4044.26 --> 4050.53
must have been vast and territories must

4048.25 --> 4053.74
have been carriers of knowledge of

4050.53 --> 4057.309
certain types that they unleashed on the

4053.74 --> 4060.3089999999997
world and helped change it to that

4057.309 --> 4062.98
culture so they may not have been there

4060.309 --> 4065.4900000000002
to rule everything but they helped

4062.98 --> 4069.19
shaped how everything manifested and

4065.49 --> 4074.319
then the Phoenicians infiltrated that

4069.19 --> 4077.77
and turn it around 180 degrees and just

4074.319 --> 4080.68
made it all implode and it's also routed

4077.77 --> 4083.799
in in the workings of energy the balance

4080.68 --> 4086.0789999999997
between the light and the darkness it

4083.799 --> 4089.74
has to do with that it's very mystical

4086.079 --> 4096.64
how it works how something that is so

4089.74 --> 4098.44
pure can be so damaged by a dark idea of

4096.64 --> 4102.7300000000005
them in the middle of nowhere just

4098.44 --> 4105.928999999999
slipping in and poisoning it and turning

4102.73 --> 4109.509
all of the light against itself and

4105.929 --> 4111.91
there is a more mystical lesson to be

4109.509 --> 4114.1
learned in this and it is what I've been

4111.91 --> 4116.469
focusing on it's also heavily heavily

4114.1 --> 4119.7390000000005
reflected in my dark world experiences

4116.469 --> 4122.949
heavily heavily reflected so much to me

4119.739 --> 4126.099999999999
it was always the demons and the angels

4122.949 --> 4128.169999999999
and they seemed to be translating in

4126.1 --> 4129.759
this Tartarian culture and the

4128.17 --> 4131.7300000000005
Phoenician culture and their

4129.759 --> 4135.969
methodologies both of them it just

4131.73 --> 4138.339
coincides perfectly to me so far but I'm

4135.969 --> 4139.34
still putting the puzzle pieces together

4138.339 --> 4142.2
and

4139.34 --> 4144.4800000000005
I'm sure I still feel like I'm in the

4142.2 --> 4146.67
beginning stages of that there's much

4144.48 --> 4150.2699999999995
more to figure out about it this is

4146.67 --> 4152.7
what's so valuable for fliers this we're

4150.27 --> 4156.570000000001
trying to say to people look you have

4152.7 --> 4158.91
been lied to and you don't live on a

4156.57 --> 4161.549999999999
spinning ball you live on a flat plane

4158.91 --> 4163.17
and when you tell them about the first

4161.55 --> 4165.56
thing that goes through the man like it

4163.17 --> 4168.21
did with me the first time that I ever

4165.56 --> 4169.860000000001
had a link to look at a flat earth video

4168.21 --> 4172.26
I refused to look at it I was like yeah

4169.86 --> 4173.88
and this went on for about six months

4172.26 --> 4177.63
and eventually when I ran out of stuff

4173.88 --> 4179.7300000000005
to watch I thought come on and I'll

4177.63 --> 4182.22
click this bloody link that keeps on

4179.73 --> 4186.0
popping up and I watched a video right

4182.22 --> 4188.610000000001
and I think that's what it takes but

4186.0 --> 4190.62
then you also have to know that if

4188.61 --> 4192.57
you're not conspiracy minded you have to

4190.62 --> 4196.89
be educated that you've been taught that

4192.57 --> 4199.049999999999
taught lies from a very early age so to

4196.89 --> 4200.46
process that why would they do that how

4199.05 --> 4202.2
would they get away with it why would

4200.46 --> 4205.44
they lie to you and then you've got

4202.2 --> 4209.3099999999995
Martin leekie who's producing your real

4205.44 --> 4211.919999999999
history or at least a good portion of

4209.31 --> 4213.6900000000005
the history yeah even in that what you

4211.92 --> 4215.43
think you have been taught well what you

4213.69 --> 4218.219999999999
think you know and what you have been

4215.43 --> 4220.89
told are two completely different sides

4218.22 --> 4224.610000000001
of martin littke is kind of in his own

4220.89 --> 4227.88
way like a archaeologists digging up

4224.61 --> 4230.46
things that yeah we haven't seen before

4227.88 --> 4234.51
and that have been left out of the

4230.46 --> 4238.47
picture yeah exactly that's like a flat

4234.51 --> 4240.93
earth archaeologist he talks about the

4238.47 --> 4243.51
navvies the the irish navy's that went

4240.93 --> 4246.81
across and apparently did all this

4243.51 --> 4248.91
tunneling work in in america and stuff

4246.81 --> 4251.25
it does make more sense that they

4248.91 --> 4253.08
actually dug it out rather than does the

4251.25 --> 4256.08
tunnels you know and then when you look

4253.08 --> 4259.38
at the photographic evidence that shows

4256.08 --> 4261.18
mud all around the building I mean it is

4259.38 --> 4264.150000000001
so compelling that the must have been

4261.18 --> 4267.96
some kind of mud floors like he says I

4264.15 --> 4270.389999999999
mean I tried I struggled to new to

4267.96 --> 4273.039
visualize it or how it actually happened

4270.39 --> 4275.019
but the evidence is there

4273.039 --> 4276.789
that it certainly did and you can see

4275.019 --> 4282.01
that in the hey you know you can go

4276.789 --> 4283.9
around me most you know most black where

4282.01 --> 4286.780000000001
I live in Blackpool go to black hole you

4283.9 --> 4288.19
go near the promenade right honestly all

4286.78 --> 4291.88
the houses that are built there they

4288.19 --> 4294.098999999999
have these parts of the house that are

4291.88 --> 4297.07
under the floor you know under the the

4294.099 --> 4299.309
ground level with a window in it's like

4297.07 --> 4301.57
who the hell would build that wipe

4299.309 --> 4304.0
Netherlands is full of it as well

4301.57 --> 4308.53
all the other cities Amsterdam

4304.0 --> 4313.71
especially all have it very very much so

4308.53 --> 4316.659
but I am still not entirely settled on

4313.71 --> 4320.05
that the mud flood is a completely

4316.659 --> 4324.699
unified event because that is where

4320.05 --> 4327.639
Martin like he says yes it is obviously

4324.699 --> 4330.369
he propagates that yes it is a unified

4327.639 --> 4332.92
event it was everywhere it was one thing

4330.369 --> 4337.98
well I'm thinking starting to think is

4332.92 --> 4341.76
maybe it's not maybe it was actually a

4337.98 --> 4345.61
concerted effort on several fronts

4341.76 --> 4350.829000000001
unleashing it to make it appear like a

4345.61 --> 4355.598999999999
unified event to make it to mythologize

4350.829 --> 4358.869
like a new flood happening see it's like

4355.599 --> 4362.5
a mind control thing to see oh it's all

4358.869 --> 4364.929
chance it do clean slate effect but it

4362.5 --> 4369.46
may have not been a naturally occurring

4364.929 --> 4376.38
even yeah but unified offense okay given

4369.46 --> 4378.82
separately even separate times if you

4376.38 --> 4381.579
used to walk Barton leak this channel

4378.82 --> 4384.369
first and then you came to flat earth

4381.579 --> 4387.009999999999
you would you would probably look at

4384.369 --> 4388.719
Flat Earth a lot more favorably by

4387.01 --> 4391.51
realizing the fact that you have been

4388.719 --> 4393.099
lied to about your history so once you

4391.51 --> 4395.079000000001
understand that they are capable of

4393.099 --> 4396.9400000000005
doing that then it's like when you look

4395.079 --> 4399.369
into Flat Earth it becomes more logical

4396.94 --> 4401.169999999999
that okay well this is the progression

4399.369 --> 4404.469
and you know this is where they happens

4401.17 --> 4406.33
now but yeah there is no proof there's

4404.469 --> 4407.86
no scientific shout-out to Brendan

4406.33 --> 4411.25
by the way thank you for the super chat

4407.86 --> 4417.04
5 pounds donation this what you have to

4411.25 --> 4420.34
do to get a shout out now and yeah just

4417.04 --> 4422.65
coming on that theme with and I'll say

4420.34 --> 4426.610000000001
this again to any global that's in the

4422.65 --> 4428.32
chat right now and I'm sure that

4426.61 --> 4431.0199999999995
probably most of the globe is in the

4428.32 --> 4432.969999999999
chat right now actually know that 9/11

4431.02 --> 4434.56
didn't happen the way that they told us

4432.97 --> 4436.96
it happened that the buildings didn't

4434.56 --> 4440.2300000000005
just fall down straight at their own

4436.96 --> 4442.45
footprint by a plane hitting them you

4440.23 --> 4444.429999999999
know and they didn't it wasn't jet fuel

4442.45 --> 4446.5599999999995
that brought those buildings down right

4444.43 --> 4448.93
they were they were the first buildings

4446.56 --> 4453.370000000001
in the history of the world to have ever

4448.93 --> 4456.22
done that ok so let me finish which is

4453.37 --> 4459.73
the if the globe is that are in the chat

4456.22 --> 4463.06
right now agreeing with us you know that

4459.73 --> 4465.3099999999995
9/11 didn't happen the way it did and

4463.06 --> 4467.830000000001
then you look at the way that they are

4465.31 --> 4470.7300000000005
censoring 9/11 the way that all the

4467.83 --> 4475.57
media have all stuck to the same story

4470.73 --> 4477.759999999999
and that the history books are putting

4475.57 --> 4480.37
out there that these terrorists brought

4477.76 --> 4482.89
these buildings down from a cave with

4480.37 --> 4485.65
jet fuel and you know literally you are

4482.89 --> 4487.84
seeing history rewritten right in front

4485.65 --> 4491.71
of your eyes right now and you're a part

4487.84 --> 4493.78
of that you people in chat right now who

4491.71 --> 4496.24
are listening to this you were a part

4493.78 --> 4498.04
and still are a part of that you are a

4496.24 --> 4501.16
part of this conspiracy this cover-up

4498.04 --> 4503.29
because by staying silent about it you

4501.16 --> 4505.21
are actually going over along with the

4503.29 --> 4507.31
narrative and this is what has happened

4505.21 --> 4509.92
throughout history you are actually

4507.31 --> 4512.77
watching history being rewritten right

4509.92 --> 4515.56
now in front of your eyes and you are

4512.77 --> 4518.71
still believing in the globe model in

4515.56 --> 4520.870000000001
2019 well the globe model is probably

4518.71 --> 4524.11
what makes it so easy for the

4520.87 --> 4526.24
controllers to actually do it if your

4524.11 --> 4530.259999999999
entire foundation your conceptualization

4526.24 --> 4533.469
of creation itself is completely 180

4530.26 --> 4536.320000000001
degrees away from the truth

4533.469 --> 4539.949
then it's not that hard to accept any

4536.32 --> 4543.04
kind of convoluted crazy story as truth

4539.949 --> 4547.919999999999
by the authorities that bring that same

4543.04 --> 4551.469
story to youth its the phoenicians way

4547.92 --> 4553.18
as I say you are literally watching you

4551.469 --> 4553.96
are watching history being rewritten

4553.18 --> 4556.6
right now

4553.96 --> 4558.31
you're part of it and like I say if you

4556.6 --> 4560.71
think that history can't be changed and

4558.31 --> 4562.27
these controllers can't changed the way

4560.71 --> 4564.1
the narrative of how things have

4562.27 --> 4565.900000000001
actually happened you are living in a

4564.1 --> 4567.58
time when you have visualized you have

4565.9 --> 4569.92
been there yourself you've seen it you

4567.58 --> 4571.2699999999995
have all the evidence you know it didn't

4569.92 --> 4573.67
happen the way that they are telling us

4571.27 --> 4576.01
or history and the history books are

4573.67 --> 4578.41
being written right now excluding your

4576.01 --> 4581.14
voice excluding your knowledge and just

4578.41 --> 4584.34
given the mainstream narrative and that

4581.14 --> 4584.34
should be enough to wake you up

4588.57 --> 4592.54
shout out to Billy was a yeah Charlotte

4591.28 --> 4595.36
oh really wasn't a thank you for the

4592.54 --> 4597.4
super chair and no Brendan cook doesn't

4595.36 --> 4603.5199999999995
need a shout out I already did so shut

4597.4 --> 4605.949
up stop doing that so annoying like I

4603.52 --> 4608.71
did a shout out then stop whining about

4605.949 --> 4611.73
me having to do that just if you didn't

4608.71 --> 4611.7300000000005
see it pay more attention

4613.65 --> 4618.099999999999
no you didn't you need a little sleep a

4616.48 --> 4621.73
chat with somebody telling you to shout

4618.1 --> 4625.780000000001
out from Nicole all right oh yeah right

4621.73 --> 4627.5199999999995
okay that sense okay yeah if you want me

4625.78 --> 4629.739
to do it you'll have to donate to my

4627.52 --> 4633.67
super chat again and then I'll shout

4629.739 --> 4637.69
them out anyway

4633.67 --> 4641.7
yeah yeah one of the more important

4637.69 --> 4647.549999999999
things about the whole history narrative

4641.7 --> 4652.98
is you know the tactic is not so much

4647.55 --> 4658.39
telling you a false history as it is

4652.98 --> 4662.679999999999
leaving entire elements out of the

4658.39 --> 4664.87
history that they present that is the

4662.68 --> 4669.7300000000005
main factor what they're really doing

4664.87 --> 4674.11
they're leaving out entire aspects of it

4669.73 --> 4677.44
so they're cutting away inside empires

4674.11 --> 4679.87
entire cultures entire Heritage's and

4677.44 --> 4683.5599999999995
where they came from they cut it out and

4679.87 --> 4687.09
they try to seam it back together to

4683.56 --> 4692.740000000001
give you an incomplete story that is

4687.09 --> 4695.26
much easier to ya manipulate people with

4692.74 --> 4697.99
in a certain direction because if you

4695.26 --> 4700.33
give the full enriched story of the

4697.99 --> 4702.04
complete history of everything that

4700.33 --> 4703.8099999999995
happened and all the cultures that came

4702.04 --> 4707.53
before us and their glory and their

4703.81 --> 4710.68
struggles if you know total history

4707.53 --> 4713.5599999999995
you're not gonna be repeating it so

4710.68 --> 4715.780000000001
easily because you actually know it you

4713.56 --> 4717.88
know the depth of it and that's the

4715.78 --> 4720.49
trick that's why they gave us the

4717.88 --> 4722.41
medieval era where everybody believed in

4720.49 --> 4726.19
Flat Earth and was [ __ ] and did

4722.41 --> 4727.66
incest and [ __ ] [ __ ] on the streets

4726.19 --> 4729.849999999999
according to them that's their

4727.66 --> 4732.49
fabrication that's the filler they gave

4729.85 --> 4735.34
us you got a little sweeter oh and

4732.49 --> 4740.7699999999995
indeed yeah Thank You Billy was up for

4735.34 --> 4742.45
the super chat let me so he was here I

4740.77 --> 4746.1
want to whisper not a shout out from

4742.45 --> 4749.65
Karen be okay shout out to Billy was

4746.1 --> 4753.280000000001
good right oh and Lisa Murkowski thank

4749.65 --> 4759.389999999999
you for the $5 super jet rich guys like

4753.28 --> 4762.54
rockets right well like rich guys like

4759.39 --> 4767.75
phallic-shaped things in

4762.54 --> 4771.11
I'd say you know it's their compensation

4767.75 --> 4771.11
they needed

4778.099 --> 4781.099
yep

4785.09 --> 4792.22
it's yeah you were talking about middle

4787.4 --> 4796.12
ages and yeah

4792.22 --> 4799.64
middle ages were basically the remnants

4796.12 --> 4804.0199999999995
like the after you cut out everything

4799.64 --> 4805.55
every the the peak of civilizations that

4804.02 --> 4808.1900000000005
were happening right then and probably

4805.55 --> 4811.28
like the territory ins as well but also

4808.19 --> 4812.9
the the pre mud flood kingdoms and

4811.28 --> 4816.38
everything there was so much more

4812.9 --> 4821.17
happening there and they just cut away

4816.38 --> 4825.11
most of it left a couple of elements

4821.17 --> 4829.43
very sloppily very small compared yellow

4825.11 --> 4832.4
archaic and just gave us this ridiculous

4829.43 --> 4833.450000000001
painting this illusion that everything

4832.4 --> 4838.219999999999
was [ __ ]

4833.45 --> 4841.01
everyone was stupid and I doubt that

4838.22 --> 4847.0
that's the case I absolutely doubt it

4841.01 --> 4847.0
I bet there was probably incredible

4847.21 --> 4853.46
medical knowledge in herbalism sense and

4851.03 --> 4856.13
maybe even energy healing all of that

4853.46 --> 4857.68
that was probably all there all this

4856.13 --> 4860.3
knowledge that we're naturally

4857.68 --> 4863.06
rediscovering it was probably rampant

4860.3 --> 4866.33
back then and that is exactly a reason

4863.06 --> 4867.950000000001
why to erase it all cuz I mean if the

4866.33 --> 4870.23
people have all the knowledge to do

4867.95 --> 4874.28
everything then the controllers can't

4870.23 --> 4878.419999999999
control them knowledge is power such as

4874.28 --> 4881.36
the Druids right as we were told that

4878.42 --> 4883.63
we've been taught history about a you

4881.36 --> 4886.54
know sect of people called the Druids

4883.63 --> 4891.56
well essentially that might have been

4886.54 --> 4893.63
what common knowledge 500 years ago not

4891.56 --> 4897.34
entirely not entirely

4893.63 --> 4897.34
I think druids is mostly a

4898.14 --> 4905.59
it's like it is a religion anyway it is

4902.62 --> 4911.4
an old religion that incorporates

4905.59 --> 4915.49
shamanism and very naturalist traditions

4911.4 --> 4918.79
but yeah they were up I think the Druids

4915.49 --> 4921.55
in the wrong way had their own occult

4918.79 --> 4923.89
power just like the Vatican has all

4921.55 --> 4924.610000000001
their freakin secrets and their creepy

4923.89 --> 4929.320000000001
[ __ ]

4924.61 --> 4931.57
the Druids had their own things their

4929.32 --> 4934.69
own secret knowledge and occult stuff

4931.57 --> 4937.389999999999
very very powerful stuff and ethereal

4934.69 --> 4940.96
stuff and they were probably in direct

4937.39 --> 4945.910000000001
competition so they were destroyed and

4940.96 --> 4949.75
then turned into crazy sacrificing

4945.91 --> 4953.889999999999
everything disgusting carnage barbarians

4949.75 --> 4960.01
and that's now yeah how we remember him

4953.89 --> 4965.08
basically per second would you start a

4960.01 --> 4967.09
threat from chalky now he says he'll

4965.08 --> 4969.25
jump in in five minutes

4967.09 --> 4972.7300000000005
well I think in five minutes Nathan's

4969.25 --> 4974.08
gonna have a debate start up so yeah but

4972.73 --> 4977.11
nobody watches that stuff because it's

4974.08 --> 4982.0
all premiere oh no life debate

4977.11 --> 4983.92
no laughs today no he's having the week

4982.0 --> 4986.58
hand off the gun I think he yeah this

4983.92 --> 4988.87
first weekend off in 13 years last week

4986.58 --> 4995.23
he must have enjoyed it that much that

4988.87 --> 4996.67
he wants another one Nathan he's getting

4995.23 --> 4999.549999999999
in life too much

4996.67 --> 5003.24
well maybe it's to do with this little

4999.55 --> 5004.68
one that's on the way so you know maybe

5003.24 --> 5007.55
something to look after the missus you

5004.68 --> 5016.68
know the weekend make a cup of tea and

5007.55 --> 5018.539
make a dinner housewife yeah you got it

5016.68 --> 5022.7390000000005
you got to treat your lady

5018.539 --> 5024.659
really nice when they're pregnant it's

5022.739 --> 5028.768999999999
not long to go what is this is in April

5024.659 --> 5032.21
so seven months gone at least oh really

5028.769 --> 5035.4490000000005
wow yeah that's secret for a long time

5032.21 --> 5037.7390000000005
didn't you know I had no idea

5035.449 --> 5044.579
all right there yeah baby's doing a

5037.739 --> 5055.5
couple of moves jealous can you guess

5044.579 --> 5056.909
the sex is it a boy wrong female all

5055.5 --> 5058.219
right they're always gonna have one of

5056.909 --> 5066.69
those old girl

5058.219 --> 5069.289
yeah probably give you guys sorry do you

5066.69 --> 5069.289
got any kid

5072.69 --> 5078.33
if you plug on any oh you can't plan on

5076.739 --> 5081.69
that on my own you know I'm not gonna

5078.33 --> 5084.989
get clones or something but yeah that

5081.69 --> 5088.32
I've wanted children for quite some time

5084.989 --> 5094.849999999999
I wanted it with my ex she didn't and

5088.32 --> 5094.849999999999
then yeah that was that so

5097.82 --> 5106.42
well that's his wife things go with one

5103.22 --> 5106.42
sack I'll be back in two minute

5114.82 --> 5123.74
especially now luckily as a man don't

5121.61 --> 5130.009999999999
really have to worry that at some point

5123.74 --> 5133.429999999999
I can't do that anymore but I'm more

5130.01 --> 5136.49
worried that the amount of women out

5133.43 --> 5139.79
there that actually want kids are going

5136.49 --> 5142.03
to like run out and there's only gonna

5139.79 --> 5142.03
be

5144.7 --> 5152.26
it's like the weirdest conceptualization

5147.85 --> 5155.410000000001
ever it's like damn it when I was young

5152.26 --> 5157.87
all I wanted was sex and now when I'm

5155.41 --> 5160.33
getting older I'm realizing oh [ __ ] I

5157.87 --> 5162.73
may actually end up with only women that

5160.33 --> 5164.55
have sex and every time I bring up would

5162.73 --> 5172.12
you like to have a kid they'll run away

5164.55 --> 5173.77
that's not a very nice outlook but I

5172.12 --> 5177.07
don't know what's gonna happen you know

5173.77 --> 5179.56
maybe if I get financially more

5177.07 --> 5181.719999999999
extensive if I if the super chat keeps

5179.56 --> 5186.04
on rolling in Thank You Billy was I yes

5181.72 --> 5188.110000000001
this is life but maybe that all will

5186.04 --> 5191.91
change I don't know what's gonna come

5188.11 --> 5199.15
along to me but yeah I'd love to have a

5191.91 --> 5202.78
kid or multiple and you know what I'll

5199.15 --> 5205.66
see where that goes you know I'm not shy

5202.78 --> 5210.79
of even having kids with multiple wives

5205.66 --> 5213.84
or women I don't know I if it feels

5210.79 --> 5213.84
right I'll do it

5217.26 --> 5219.860000000001
yeah

5223.13 --> 5229.86
but yeah I'm not gonna just pick out

5226.979 --> 5232.9490000000005
some random woman like oh you are a

5229.86 --> 5239.63
woman you can have kids but have kids no

5232.949 --> 5244.228999999999
I want not necess to be a person that

5239.63 --> 5246.959
can at least understand who I am if they

5244.229 --> 5251.55
have that talents then they might become

5246.959 --> 5255.719
eligible this is way too early you know

5251.55 --> 5256.34
you have to start dating first so I'm up

5255.719 --> 5259.439
for that

5256.34 --> 5261.769
especially this spring I'm very much up

5259.439 --> 5261.769
for that

5269.269 --> 5276.05
and I've made plenty of mistakes with

5272.449 --> 5280.509999999999
falling in love and overlooking things

5276.05 --> 5280.51
and with women

5286.54 --> 5293.2
I'm back I see you've had another

5290.71 --> 5301.92
another super job they keep on rolling

5293.2 --> 5301.92
in is it live yeah it is be sure yeah

5307.119 --> 5316.869
and how many people are watching we go

5311.209 --> 5320.51
70 watch it it's pretty cool nice thanks

5316.869 --> 5325.449
I'm getting a bit hungry though so if

5320.51 --> 5330.969
anyone else wants to join in the panel

5325.449 --> 5330.969
then yeah then I can keep on rolling

5332.619 --> 5336.889
quite interesting I went thousands of

5334.639 --> 5338.329
entries today huh I went down to the

5336.889 --> 5342.1990000000005
beach and put a video out yesterday

5338.329 --> 5344.78
again there's nothing to see literally

5342.199 --> 5347.018999999999
nothing to see and that's the whole

5344.78 --> 5347.018999999999
point

5347.289 --> 5353.268999999999
it's like if he was trying to line up

5349.939 --> 5355.34
your horizon line with what you were

5353.269 --> 5357.409000000001
seeing with a theodolite you would

5355.34 --> 5359.3
essentially be sitting tilts in the

5357.409 --> 5361.789
theodolite down so much that you would

5359.3 --> 5365.179
probably come back on yourself within 50

5361.789 --> 5371.57
miles and I don't think the globe is

5365.179 --> 5375.669
understand that concept is that the only

5371.57 --> 5380.599
you know the horizon isn't a fixed

5375.669 --> 5385.159
horizon it's it's changes with the

5380.599 --> 5386.659000000001
atmosphere yep and it all depends on how

5385.159 --> 5388.759999999999
fight and see an engine or something

5386.659 --> 5390.438999999999
even though the Sun was out it was blue

5388.76 --> 5394.2390000000005
skies it looked like it was going to be

5390.439 --> 5397.070000000001
a nice day the visibility was [ __ ] and

5394.239 --> 5402.169
what are we coming up to well coming up

5397.07 --> 5404.148999999999
to the full moon aren't we wait we're

5402.169 --> 5407.599
starting to come towards the full moon

5404.149 --> 5410.2390000000005
right right and that's when the the

5407.599 --> 5413.539
clarity of the air seems to deteriorate

5410.239 --> 5416.388999999999
the most and then a couple of days after

5413.539 --> 5419.119
that the full moon knew everything was

5416.389 --> 5421.369
bright again and you can see a long long

5419.119 --> 5427.909
way colors are clearer everything is

5421.369 --> 5429.469
much brighter that's odd it is maybe a

5427.909 --> 5433.459
lab there's something to do with the

5429.469 --> 5433.669
coldness of the moonlight yeah I'm not

5433.459 --> 5436.909
sure

5433.669 --> 5438.0599999999995
well cold the moonlight book it just

5436.909 --> 5442.259999999999
makes sense

5438.06 --> 5445.26
right if you look there's moist in the

5442.26 --> 5450.72
air if it's gonna get cold then it will

5445.26 --> 5452.24
turn more to become cloudy so in that

5450.72 --> 5454.2300000000005
sense it would make sense

5452.24 --> 5456.99
yeah the plane trees asked me to

5454.23 --> 5459.45
document it well I have actually I've

5456.99 --> 5460.92
actually spoke about it numerous times

5459.45 --> 5464.639999999999
on my channel on different videos that

5460.92 --> 5467.25
I've pulled out and it's always the same

5464.64 --> 5469.68
it really is always the same unless it's

5467.25 --> 5472.32
absolutely raining which is only ever

5469.68 --> 5474.06
happened once where it was rain in two

5472.32 --> 5476.61
days after the full moon and you

5474.06 --> 5479.97
couldn't see anything because of the

5476.61 --> 5482.639999999999
rain or prior to this you know every

5479.97 --> 5485.52
other single thing and even since every

5482.64 --> 5486.75
time has been great visibility and when

5485.52 --> 5491.070000000001
you're looking at like Blackpool Tower

5486.75 --> 5494.28
Blackpool towers a very prominent

5491.07 --> 5495.96
landmark for me so when I'm driving I

5494.28 --> 5499.11
can see Blackpool Tower from four or

5495.96 --> 5500.82
five miles away easily in the car so

5499.11 --> 5502.589999999999
over houses and stuff you know and

5500.82 --> 5504.33
certain stretches of road so I can see

5502.59 --> 5506.52
the tower in the distance and it's

5504.33 --> 5508.71
always a good gauge for me because when

5506.52 --> 5512.070000000001
you when you look at it it has a it has

5508.71 --> 5514.41
a certain colour and the richness of the

5512.07 --> 5516.36
color determines whether or not it's

5514.41 --> 5519.96
going to be a worth me going down to the

5516.36 --> 5522.42
promenade and filming so I can see the

5519.96 --> 5524.28
tower and if I'm driving towards a tower

5522.42 --> 5526.56
and I see it and it's really rich

5524.28 --> 5528.78
colours on the tower and know that

5526.56 --> 5532.05
visibility is going to be exceptional

5528.78 --> 5533.16
down at the beach and it's always been

5532.05 --> 5534.6
the same it's always been a couple of

5533.16 --> 5537.15
days after the full moon that this with

5534.6 --> 5538.56
visibility and I'm talking about the

5537.15 --> 5540.87
richness of the colors more than

5538.56 --> 5542.46
anything as well as everything else I've

5540.87 --> 5544.49
got them all just I've got loads of

5542.46 --> 5546.66
documentation of this actually happening

5544.49 --> 5548.46
you guys honestly you should you should

5546.66 --> 5549.93
you should perhaps have a look at it

5548.46 --> 5551.58
yourself you know in the in the chance

5549.93 --> 5554.610000000001
of the plane to assess but I mean the

5551.58 --> 5556.68
topic itself is the focus of the

5554.61 --> 5559.41
observation yeah I mean that's what I

5556.68 --> 5560.7300000000005
mean I think I said it I didn't think I

5559.41 --> 5562.5
thought I was going around the bend when

5560.73 --> 5565.139999999999
I first started talking about it but

5562.5 --> 5566.96
then it kept happening and it was every

5565.14 --> 5569.55
time two days after the full moon

5566.96 --> 5571.26
beautiful clarity in the air rich colors

5569.55 --> 5573.9890000000005
every single time

5571.26 --> 5575.37
and it to me it seems like that's for

5573.989 --> 5577.259999999999
whatever reads like you say it could be

5575.37 --> 5579.03
the coldness of the Moon book it feels

5577.26 --> 5581.64
to me lighting your matter in the air

5579.03 --> 5583.889999999999
amazing if it filter in the atmosphere

5581.64 --> 5585.51
it feels like it's been filtered you

5583.89 --> 5587.85
know it's like it's taken all the crap

5585.51 --> 5590.1900000000005
out of the air and allowed you to just

5587.85 --> 5592.7390000000005
see if you haven't got that the pollen

5590.19 --> 5595.139999999999
you know all the little bits of pollen

5592.739 --> 5600.959999999999
in the air that bill will probably I

5595.14 --> 5605.610000000001
don't know is the air or what the mist

5600.96 --> 5608.91
formation the water yeah the cold

5605.61 --> 5612.92
turning the water vapor into water would

5608.91 --> 5617.57
that drag the particles out of the air

5612.92 --> 5621.47
because hot and rain by dusts basically

5617.57 --> 5625.98
connecting to the water maybe that's it

5621.47 --> 5628.35
HIV right yeah I mean wow I mean I just

5625.98 --> 5629.82
want this to be documented in fact it's

5628.35 --> 5631.4400000000005
something that I've probably focused on

5629.82 --> 5635.849999999999
this year I might do a series about it

5631.44 --> 5639.57
and just put it into a playlist which

5635.85 --> 5641.400000000001
will be two days before the full moon so

5639.57 --> 5643.17
I'll do a video and I'll say this is the

5641.4 --> 5644.879999999999
weather conditions two days before the

5643.17 --> 5646.38
full moon these are the settings that

5644.88 --> 5648.45
I'm using this is the camera settings

5646.38 --> 5649.77
this is the time of day this is where it

5648.45 --> 5652.08
is full time you know I'll have all the

5649.77 --> 5654.450000000001
data there obviously and then I'll do a

5652.08 --> 5658.17
video two days after the full moon and

5654.45 --> 5660.179999999999
we can compare them side-by-side and you

5658.17 --> 5664.32
will see the brightness of the colors

5660.18 --> 5666.39
are so much clearer yeah can't wait to

5664.32 --> 5669.33
see that that's not a bad thing that's

5666.39 --> 5670.650000000001
interesting I'll do that what date we

5669.33 --> 5673.89
know let me find out when the full moon

5670.65 --> 5676.969999999999
is the sixteenth right now hello

5673.89 --> 5676.97
chocolate scene wait away

5681.69 --> 5695.049999999999
good morning I've been already up for

5686.16 --> 5698.98
six and a half hours funny like okay so

5695.05 --> 5700.75
I need to film in tomorrow that'll be

5698.98 --> 5703.78
two days before the full moon the full

5700.75 --> 5706.69
moon is on the 19th so I need to build

5703.78 --> 5708.849999999999
on the 17th and show you the clarity if

5706.69 --> 5710.32
we can see anything on that day maybe I

5708.85 --> 5712.6
should focus on Blackpool Tower and show

5710.32 --> 5714.969999999999
you how the colours change on that

5712.6 --> 5716.650000000001
because it looks really dull and drab a

5714.97 --> 5718.21
couple of days before the full moon and

5716.65 --> 5723.7
then after the full moon couple days

5718.21 --> 5729.88
really rich and vibrant change yeah I

5723.7 --> 5732.46
will yeah I went to the market today

5729.88 --> 5737.2300000000005
right away to non-related side don't

5732.46 --> 5741.97
I've got some fabric for new pants I

5737.23 --> 5746.139999999999
love this stuff this is like good strong

5797.65 --> 5800.009999999999
right now

[Laughter]

5813.37 --> 5827.24
can you see my weapon yeah actually a

5818.33 --> 5830.69
nice coho amazing we never you have to

5827.24 --> 5833.3
go if you had the ball material for a

5830.69 --> 5835.21
tailor to go make you some pumps yeah he

5833.3 --> 5838.43
just goes no don't Lee

5835.21 --> 5841.57
yeah I had my previous pair of pants

5838.43 --> 5845.87
actually have my name knitted in it so

5841.57 --> 5847.73
but yeah I did that I started doing that

5845.87 --> 5849.5
when it entered the Gothic scene

5847.73 --> 5853.04
basically and I thought like yeah I'm

5849.5 --> 5858.53
not gonna buy some cheap-ass crap

5853.04 --> 5861.05
thus yeah they were like Gothic clothing

5858.53 --> 5862.91
items and [ __ ] especially when the goth

5861.05 --> 5864.74
scene started up where like everywhere

5862.91 --> 5867.92
but it was all almost all of it was

5864.74 --> 5869.96
cheap crap that just started to rip open

5867.92 --> 5871.55
or break like after two deuces and it

5869.96 --> 5874.46
was so sick of that so I thought like

5871.55 --> 5876.59
okay I'm just gonna get everything

5874.46 --> 5878.87
custom-made I'm gonna make my own

5876.59 --> 5881.27
jewelry and I'm gonna go to a tailor and

5878.87 --> 5883.16
basically say okay this is what you're

5881.27 --> 5886.040000000001
gonna make exactly like this and it's

5883.16 --> 5891.8
gonna have to last four years of wearing

5886.04 --> 5895.49
it daily and so I did that and yeah I'm

5891.8 --> 5897.35
very happy I did because it was a bit of

5895.49 --> 5900.679999999999
an investment back then but yeah it

5897.35 --> 5903.530000000001
lasted extremely long and I don't have a

5900.68 --> 5907.87
giant junk pile of cheap-ass clothes

5903.53 --> 5907.87
behind me in my history now

5908.419 --> 5920.57
I knew that did you have all win

5913.789 --> 5924.909
written in it now the rest of my name

5920.57 --> 5929.058999999999
but that's the III you know what Arwen

5924.909 --> 5931.009999999999
know it well I actually asked the Flat

5929.059 --> 5933.019
Earth data what about

5931.01 --> 5935.389
Norwin he's like no no no no no you're

5933.019 --> 5938.63
not that what why not

5935.389 --> 5940.849
why am I not 33 why does Patricia stare

5938.63 --> 5945.999
mark sergeant Nathan Oakley and everyone

5940.849 --> 5945.999
have to be 33 why not me you in school

5947.769 --> 5956.269
yeah you know I was 33 six years ago

5951.38 --> 5959.329
that was because I was curious but I was

5956.269 --> 5963.399
like you were there weren't you chuckle

5959.329 --> 5963.398999999999
yeah you were there the whole time I

5963.88 --> 5977.419
continued to talk yeah I I tried I tried

5974.179 --> 5979.539
to kind of get him to see like all right

5977.419 --> 5985.28
dude you're a fighter that's right so

5979.539 --> 5987.289
obviously you know you're trying to put

5985.28 --> 5990.349
a message out there and I think that

5987.289 --> 5991.82
message is sort of getting lost and the

5990.349 --> 5992.709
way you're coming off with all this

5991.82 --> 5995.808999999999
gematria

5992.709 --> 5998.599
33 [ __ ] because not a lot of people

5995.809 --> 6003.070000000001
respond to this in the way that you

5998.599 --> 6012.749
would like and you know like you can

6003.07 --> 6015.61
kind of come off point you're losing the

6012.749 --> 6023.739
grandeur message like sure yeah you want

6015.61 --> 6026.438999999999
to talk about Tamachi and all that just

6023.739 --> 6028.688999999999
didn't have a point and he would say

6026.439 --> 6031.030000000001
this number that no and then like yeah

6028.689 --> 6033.55
okay so how do you correlate that with

6031.03 --> 6037.03
the person's actual behavior and their

6033.55 --> 6039.820000000001
message and he just didn't respond

6037.03 --> 6042.909
and I tried to like to any minutes to

6039.82 --> 6044.289
Ram it in to fit in his face like like I

6042.909 --> 6048.999
was talking to a Globo

6044.289 --> 6051.539
and he just didn't respond it freaked me

6048.999 --> 6057.789
out in a way Oh Thank You Hattie

6051.539 --> 6059.38
I'm not 33 anymore no I was 33 though

6057.789 --> 6067.449
when my axe actually kicked me out of

6059.38 --> 6072.179
the house yeah it was quite the

6067.449 --> 6076.15
disappointment I can tell you that but

6072.179 --> 6079.3
no I'm not 33 anymore and I don't think

6076.15 --> 6086.138999999999
my name combined in any way is 33 and I

6079.3 --> 6091.809
don't care it means nothing it only

6086.139 --> 6094.78
means something if you go into a cult

6091.809 --> 6099.7300000000005
meaning interpretation structure of it

6094.78 --> 6106.03
with its wit is it's just a construct

6099.73 --> 6109.179999999999
you know and yeah people can design and

6106.03 --> 6113.08
program according to that conceptual

6109.18 --> 6115.6
construct that doesn't mean that there

6113.08 --> 6118.57
is nothing else but that construct it

6115.6 --> 6123.13
just means they did things in accordance

6118.57 --> 6125.65
to that construct it's like being an

6123.13 --> 6128.62
artist and you have a thing you always

6125.65 --> 6134.08
do in all your art pieces doesn't mean

6128.62 --> 6134.8
that all arts will be in accordance to

6134.08 --> 6137.32
that

6134.8 --> 6141.1900000000005
it just means no they always do it

6137.32 --> 6145.509999999999
because it's their thing I don't know I

6141.19 --> 6148.839999999999
just I can't I mean I get the important

6145.51 --> 6152.02
numbers and all this but I can't let

6148.84 --> 6155.26
what somebody's name is translated into

6152.02 --> 6157.63
numbers that that tells me what this

6155.26 --> 6160.99
person is about you know like to me

6157.63 --> 6163.51
that's I mean sure you could you could

6160.99 --> 6165.639999999999
note it okay great I'll put that in the

6163.51 --> 6168.52
chat column I've seen what that is but

6165.64 --> 6170.4400000000005
let's see what the actual messages you

6168.52 --> 6172.39
know like what are they saying what are

6170.44 --> 6175.08
they actually doing what are they

6172.39 --> 6179.110000000001
actually flipping out there suppose

6175.08 --> 6181.0
they're naming this and numbers and now

6179.11 --> 6183.429999999999
that means there's some type of misa I

6181.0 --> 6192.82
mean come on I got it I got to go with

6183.43 --> 6195.820000000001
all right what I can touch Sargent like

6192.82 --> 6200.259999999999
yeah they could have technically talks

6195.82 --> 6201.429999999999
to a freemason ooh and then just said

6200.26 --> 6205.4800000000005
yeah we're gonna do this what do you

6201.43 --> 6208.900000000001
think and it's like okay let me change

6205.48 --> 6212.11
the name if you're use it and then give

6208.9 --> 6215.009999999999
my blessing basically so even if they

6212.11 --> 6220.299999999999
did what has Patricius they were done to

6215.01 --> 6221.92
somehow you know you know you know what

6220.3 --> 6224.89
I mean like what the hell could she have

6221.92 --> 6227.89
possibly done to what grand lie as she

6224.89 --> 6230.26
put out there well I do catch some time

6227.89 --> 6231.610000000001
of my life because her you know if I

6230.26 --> 6235.2390000000005

6235.239 --> 6238.78
know world we're always here trying to

6236.98 --> 6240.879999999999
get over the fact that we all thought we

6238.78 --> 6244.21
were living on this ridiculous spinning

6240.88 --> 6248.1990000000005
ball all these years and now we go back

6244.21 --> 6251.65
to though this means I mean come on I

6248.199 --> 6256.0599999999995
mean we're here looking for a real [ __ ]

6251.65 --> 6258.849999999999
you know I mean yeah I think okay why

6256.06 --> 6263.110000000001
he's behaved especially with Fisher and

6258.85 --> 6266.29
stuff it's it's disgusting and that's

6263.11 --> 6268.659
why I'm you know I've been needling him

6266.29 --> 6270.31
for the past two weeks saying that he's

6268.659 --> 6272.379999999999
a transvestite

6270.31 --> 6274.780000000001
he's a transvestite it was basically

6272.38 --> 6277.719
born a woman and he's trying to be a man

6274.78 --> 6279.099999999999
and he hates it he's blocked me other

6277.719 --> 6280.75
people have started jumping on it a

6279.1 --> 6281.5
little bit too it was funny because I've

6280.75 --> 6283.6
liked him

6281.5 --> 6285.699
yeah he's the only person that I have

6283.6 --> 6287.59
what on YouTube but I have all these

6285.699 --> 6289.989
ridiculous trolls none of them none of

6287.59 --> 6293.469
them blocked him I have rot because he's

6289.989 --> 6296.83
is so ridiculous with his agent

6293.469 --> 6299.11
you know finger pointing it's just

6296.83 --> 6300.82
stupid yeah well the other day I was

6299.11 --> 6302.98
talking and I'm looking at the child I'm

6300.82 --> 6305.17
looking at like Wow looking at it

6302.98 --> 6307.178999999999
through the other chat because I can't

6305.17 --> 6308.6990000000005
see him because he's black he's saying

6307.179 --> 6312.159
they're talking [ __ ] about me Oh

6308.699 --> 6315.489
chocolate saying is another agent he was

6312.159 --> 6320.83
put in place and the 9/11 deniers of

6315.489 --> 6335.5599999999995
treason what the [ __ ] we all know you're

6320.83 --> 6337.989
a chocolate Asian how does he like it

6335.56 --> 6340.81
when he he's faced with an accusation

6337.989 --> 6343.599999999999
that somebody keeps on paying that is

6340.81 --> 6347.469
really going to and they'll just sort of

6343.6 --> 6348.909000000001
like make your blood boil in a way so if

6347.469 --> 6350.53
you can imagine it from Patricia and

6348.909 --> 6353.17
what she's had to be had to put up with

6350.53 --> 6355.75
for the past couple years and especially

6353.17 --> 6358.84
with this you know taking images of

6355.75 --> 6360.94
Patricia and analyzing them analyzing

6358.84 --> 6362.860000000001
the nose and the eyes and the ears all

6360.94 --> 6364.11
this kind of stuff and then saying yeah

6362.86 --> 6366.839999999999
she got that you know what

6364.11 --> 6369.719999999999
reminds me of that process I mean it

6366.84 --> 6376.04
reminds me of what what happened in

6369.72 --> 6376.04
Germany in the thirties yeah but why

6379.49 --> 6385.2
what is what is Patricia do Patricia

6382.35 --> 6387.75
interviews you know people yeah you know

6385.2 --> 6389.67
she has conversations with people she's

6387.75 --> 6391.82
not out there putting false information

6389.67 --> 6396.05
and you know induct creating people and

6391.82 --> 6396.049999999999
having people on and have them talk

6397.64 --> 6401.43
[ __ ] name is

6399.12 --> 6403.25
translate into some damn number are you

6401.43 --> 6406.5
kidding me

6403.25 --> 6409.05
you've seen her around haven't yeah well

6406.5 --> 6412.17
she came on my channel and she came on

6409.05 --> 6414.33
cam and then PJs in the side saying that

6412.17 --> 6418.9400000000005
is a that is a man that is a man

6414.33 --> 6422.88
anything literally been going on about

6418.94 --> 6424.32
this you know so I think giving it

6422.88 --> 6426.72
giving it back to him

6424.32 --> 6429.11
right giving it back to him unfounded

6426.72 --> 6432.75
accusations and calling him a female

6429.11 --> 6434.639999999999
trying to be in matter right and you've

6432.75 --> 6436.77
seen how he's triggered over it how

6434.64 --> 6439.320000000001
triggered he is over this right yeah

6436.77 --> 6440.76
right well imagine how it feels that the

6439.32 --> 6442.5
boot on the other thought because

6440.76 --> 6444.360000000001
Constance has never said anything bad

6442.5 --> 6445.67
about anybody Patricia has never said

6444.36 --> 6448.259999999999
anything bad about anybody

6445.67 --> 6450.15
certainly not online anyway you know

6448.26 --> 6452.820000000001
maybe behind the facts who knows but

6450.15 --> 6454.32
certainly not online but at the end of

6452.82 --> 6456.719999999999
the day they're not doing any harm to

6454.32 --> 6460.38
anybody and having these unfounded

6456.72 --> 6463.14
accusations is not worthy of having it

6460.38 --> 6464.43
in flat earth and people like Vijay who

6463.14 --> 6465.450000000001
are actually going out of the way to

6464.43 --> 6467.1
cause trouble

6465.45 --> 6469.29
people like vegan warrior who are

6467.1 --> 6472.29
causing [ __ ] stirring the pot they

6469.29 --> 6474.96
really have no they should have no say

6472.29 --> 6476.28
on what happens in flat is because they

6474.96 --> 6480.35
are essentially just triple trouble

6476.28 --> 6483.0599999999995
cause that's it well they have no same

6480.35 --> 6486.6
that's the thing they don't really have

6483.06 --> 6488.389
it it's only if you're gonna go along

6486.6 --> 6490.909000000001
with that type of method

6488.389 --> 6493.31
that you might be in quite like oh well

6490.909 --> 6495.679
they are criticizing the big group so

6493.31 --> 6499.7300000000005
they must be real it's all that really

6495.679 --> 6503.27
superficial approach of it all the

6499.73 --> 6505.549999999999
conspirators approach of it all that's

6503.27 --> 6512.0
that's what draws that in and useless

6505.55 --> 6515.360000000001
and I peach shade like how does he what

6512.0 --> 6519.469
about him is even Flat Earth related in

6515.36 --> 6522.049999999999
any way I rarely hear him say the word

6519.469 --> 6523.1
I've caught him saying that it's just a

6522.05 --> 6526.31
distraction

6523.1 --> 6530.2300000000005
anyway it's all a distraction from our

6526.31 --> 6535.85
starkest and a greater correlation of

6530.23 --> 6538.3099999999995
its in the clouds so I don't know I've

6535.85 --> 6546.9490000000005
always seen PJ just there's a bit of a

6538.31 --> 6548.71
clown on the side well Russian vids hit

6546.949 --> 6551.419999999999
it hit the nail on the head when he said

6548.71 --> 6553.28
last night he said look if you got

6551.42 --> 6555.26
people come in to you to a dinner and

6553.28 --> 6557.0
then they're gonna all sit down and you

6555.26 --> 6558.530000000001
can have a buffet you know what are they

6557.0 --> 6560.09
bringing to the table you know if

6558.53 --> 6562.009999999999
they're gonna each individually bring

6560.09 --> 6564.26
something to sit down and share out with

6562.01 --> 6565.969
it monks each other you know you bring a

6564.26 --> 6568.01
portion to the table and then you take a

6565.969 --> 6569.869
bit of somebody else's food and we'll

6568.01 --> 6574.67
share and share alike what if you're

6569.869 --> 6576.29
bringing nothing to the table like a PJ

6574.67 --> 6579.05
who is bringing nothing to the table

6576.29 --> 6581.239
well to be fair he does bring his dodo

6579.05 --> 6586.639
in our circus to the table every single

6581.239 --> 6588.7699999999995
time and that is his thing but yeah it's

6586.639 --> 6592.31
getting kind of old especially since

6588.77 --> 6594.59
he's not actually trying to prove it the

6592.31 --> 6595.9400000000005
way that I asked I actually challenged

6594.59 --> 6597.77
him remember like oh really

6595.94 --> 6601.009999999999
Aristarchus it's that it's a fractal

6597.77 --> 6604.9400000000005
crystal thing of the moon that is okay

6601.01 --> 6607.31
prove it Photoshop it next to each other

6604.94 --> 6611.099999999999
and actually prove forensically that it

6607.31 --> 6613.740000000001
is the same and he never did it he says

6611.1 --> 6615.81
oh yeah I will all I have in the

6613.74 --> 6623.49
background I'll show you something and

6615.81 --> 6626.43
Justin doesn't do it that he doesn't

6623.49 --> 6631.05
slip remember when I kind of flipped my

6626.43 --> 6637.47
my lid and kind of went at him about his

6631.05 --> 6640.08
age and [ __ ] agent Shea yeah what would

6637.47 --> 6642.030000000001
his agent should you know naming

6640.08 --> 6646.05
everybody agents and saying everybody's

6642.03 --> 6648.78
put in place and I I kind of lost my

6646.05 --> 6650.46
[ __ ] when I said look man just play if

6648.78 --> 6654.42
you have [ __ ] please just bring it

6650.46 --> 6657.09
out and what was because I mean you've

6654.42 --> 6659.13
been talking to [ __ ] all this time all

6657.09 --> 6661.2
these years you know so I mean if you

6659.13 --> 6663.45
have proof I'd be willing to look at it

6661.2 --> 6666.03
listen to it sure but you don't ever

6663.45 --> 6669.2699999999995
bring anything so I think in that

6666.03 --> 6672.42
episode I think was on Nathan and he

6669.27 --> 6677.64
would he he'd also he went to Eric Bay's

6672.42 --> 6680.46
list of shows and I think this is your

6677.64 --> 6682.05
proof this is your proof of calling

6680.46 --> 6684.06
everybody ages everybody that's on this

6682.05 --> 6687.96
list because Eric Dubay has a list of

6684.06 --> 6689.79
ships thanks a lot I love Eric Dubay for

6687.96 --> 6691.89
the information he's another one - just

6689.79 --> 6698.39
cause everybody shows for no [ __ ]

6691.89 --> 6698.39
reason it's like what I don't understand

6698.63 --> 6704.78
pool to call everybody a show thing it's

6701.55 --> 6704.78
just ridiculous to me

6709.589 --> 6718.829
I think the Sheol is just the the

6714.03 --> 6725.268999999999
concept of the shield is the social

6718.829 --> 6728.489
media or I guess youtuber boogeyman is

6725.269 --> 6730.559
the thing you know it's like oh if

6728.489 --> 6733.619
something is wrong then they are a

6730.559 --> 6737.55
shield and barely anyone even knows what

6733.619 --> 6740.699
it means it's just a default accusation

6737.55 --> 6743.579000000001
now Oh Thank You Brendan cooked by the

6740.699 --> 6747.629
way for the super chat shout out to Pete

6743.579 --> 6759.299999999999
Shey thanks for that and he matrix also

6747.629 --> 6762.3
thank you it's peachy not PJ people she

6759.3 --> 6764.939
I believe that a lot of types of

6762.3 --> 6767.579000000001
everybody's doing the reverse name the

6764.939 --> 6773.369000000001
anagram [ __ ] with his name so that kind

6767.579 --> 6775.438999999999
of funny well I think somebody Nora said

6773.369 --> 6777.839
it in in in the side chat which was

6775.439 --> 6779.669
basically I am trying to teach him a

6777.839 --> 6783.059
little bit of respect for other people

6779.669 --> 6784.709
by by accusing him the way he's accused

6783.059 --> 6787.829000000001
of us he's now getting this sense of

6784.709 --> 6790.379
what it feels like all the people and

6787.829 --> 6793.648999999999
although ensue again he'd give in that

6790.379 --> 6796.3189999999995
same you know feeling of unease when

6793.649 --> 6800.339
people are saying you're a woman you

6796.319 --> 6804.51
know he does act like both a whiny

6800.339 --> 6807.599
little teenage girl and an annoying i

6804.51 --> 6811.849
rambling old woman so I wouldn't be

6807.599 --> 6811.849
surprised Evie literally actually was

6813.309 --> 6820.1900000000005
and I love to call in that because when

6816.199 --> 6826.28
he gets all whiny little teenage girl

6820.19 --> 6828.018999999999
like it's so annoying I think he's got a

6826.28 --> 6833.389
voice changer to deepen his voice at

6828.019 --> 6839.4490000000005
times anonym no no I think and 43 him

6833.389 --> 6845.51
that's all natural I think he's just

6839.449 --> 6847.789
like that now I don't even want to get

6845.51 --> 6853.9400000000005
into personal psychology because it's

6847.789 --> 6856.94
just it just feels like it just needs to

6853.94 --> 6857.989
stop essentially it all needs to stop we

6856.94 --> 6860.989
need to move past this

6857.989 --> 6866.879999999999
yeah it's just I'm totally old Patricia

6860.989 --> 6868.329
stuff that's bad and I know exactly

6866.88 --> 6870.409000000001
[Music]

6868.329 --> 6872.63
literally it all of it needs to stop

6870.409 --> 6875.15
because regardless of what you think

6872.63 --> 6878.2390000000005
about people and you know margin and all

6875.15 --> 6880.638999999999
its kind they are out there doing the

6878.239 --> 6882.65
activism whether you like it or not and

6880.639 --> 6885.9490000000005
they yet okay they get their faces on

6882.65 --> 6889.308999999999
the TV but so what I'd rather have their

6885.949 --> 6891.469
faces on the TV than mine you know let

6889.309 --> 6897.409000000001
them go on the telly at least it's being

6891.469 --> 6901.7300000000005
out there so what I don't know problems

6897.409 --> 6904.518999999999
with any of the people that have a bunch

6901.73 --> 6907.549999999999
more subscribers of me and get promoted

6904.519 --> 6908.409000000001
um on TV I have no problem with that at

6907.55 --> 6912.1990000000005
all

6908.409 --> 6915.018999999999
it's all the work into itself exactly

6912.199 --> 6917.629999999999
and we don't know that how much work

6915.019 --> 6919.999
goes on behind the scenes and bye say

6917.63 --> 6921.1990000000005
bye say work I mean literally like what

6919.999 --> 6924.11
we were doing when we were talking about

6921.199 --> 6926.48
the Isle of Man stuff you know we were

6924.11 --> 6929.119
doing that stuff for 18 hours a day

6926.48 --> 6931.879999999999
probably you know me Nathan

6929.119 --> 6934.339999999999
Tony yourself you know we were all

6931.88 --> 6936.38
totally every day we were constantly

6934.34 --> 6938.539
after even now we spend the hours after

6936.38 --> 6940.6990000000005
the show talking about flat earth and

6938.539 --> 6942.8
store so it stuck people don't

6940.699 --> 6945.32
understand that it doesn't stop when

6942.8 --> 6946.519
they see us talking like now this

6945.32 --> 6948.079
carries on all day and

6946.519 --> 6949.55
you know we're actually going into the

6948.079 --> 6950.808999999999
nitty-gritty of stuff and bringing up

6949.55 --> 6954.05
all the people's videos and talking

6950.809 --> 6955.610000000001
about and trying to understand what's

6954.05 --> 6957.619000000001
going on in the video scene if we can

6955.61 --> 6960.32
use it in some way you know we're doing

6957.619 --> 6961.88
our research behind the scenes so with

6960.32 --> 6964.07
mark tagging and stuff we don't know

6961.88 --> 6966.469
just because he turns up in a location

6964.07 --> 6969.619
doesn't tell you the whole story he has

6966.469 --> 6972.26
to have got a taxi from where he lives

6969.619 --> 6974.63
to the airport or a plane ticket got on

6972.26 --> 6977.570000000001
the plane traveled to this location gone

6974.63 --> 6979.4890000000005
to a hotel set up you know all that

6977.57 --> 6981.739
traveling all that expense it comes from

6979.489 --> 6983.9
somewhere probably out of his own funds

6981.739 --> 6985.759999999999
he probably funds it himself you know

6983.9 --> 6987.17
and it's also the time that goes into

6985.76 --> 6988.400000000001
that just because he appears on the

6987.17 --> 6989.749
telly somewhere doesn't mean that he

6988.4 --> 6993.949
hasn't put an awful lot of work into

6989.749 --> 6995.539
getting there you know when I go and do

6993.949 --> 6997.94
an observation down at the promenade and

6995.539 --> 6999.679
you see a 10-minute video it's not ten

6997.94 --> 7001.808999999999
minutes work for me it's an hour and a

6999.679 --> 7003.969
half flip for the time I've got it'll

7001.809 --> 7005.860000000001
get the camera driving the car go down

7003.969 --> 7008.26
to the beach find the location settle

7005.86 --> 7010.299999999999
film come back home put the video into

7008.26 --> 7012.610000000001
it you know take the card out upload the

7010.3 --> 7016.96
video or our enough two hours worth of

7012.61 --> 7018.759999999999
work for it ten minute video the lot of

7016.96 --> 7020.65
work that goes into the stuff it's even

7018.76 --> 7022.119000000001
setting up your stream now are we you

7020.65 --> 7023.138999999999
know you still have to prepare for it II

7022.119 --> 7028.749
still have to think about what you're

7023.139 --> 7030.789
going to talk about no you know now for

7028.749 --> 7033.389
me it's mostly and what I prepare for is

7030.789 --> 7037.3
mostly just mental preparation because I

7033.389 --> 7039.099
improvise almost everything just letting

7037.3 --> 7041.1990000000005
things flow to the top of my mind

7039.099 --> 7045.34
sometimes I got a subject that's laying

7041.199 --> 7047.499
on me that I need to talk about yeah

7045.34 --> 7049.809
there's a little preparation I need to

7047.499 --> 7052.389
set the whole thing up but it's not that

7049.809 --> 7054.6990000000005
big well we got Karen in the chat and

7052.389 --> 7056.26
she'll understand because I know that

7054.699 --> 7058.719
you know she does a lot talking behind

7056.26 --> 7060.1900000000005
the scenes in Skype calls so she'll be

7058.719 --> 7061.9890000000005
speaking with Antony at one minute then

7060.19 --> 7063.489
she'll be talking in Effie core then

7061.989 --> 7065.138999999999
she'll be going out and naturally doing

7063.489 --> 7066.699
experiments with the fishtank for

7065.139 --> 7068.59
instance just going ahead and bringing

7066.699 --> 7070.989
down a fishtank putting sugar in it

7068.59 --> 7072.849
doing all this kind of stuff all for the

7070.989 --> 7075.789
benefit of flat earth and she might put

7072.849 --> 7077.829
a video out for 10 minutes you know what

7075.789 --> 7078.789
those days and days of work goes into

7077.829 --> 7083.17
this

7078.789 --> 7086.05
you know it's not just you see it

7083.17 --> 7089.829
because it was made in five seconds you

7086.05 --> 7093.84
know yeah well especially fieldwork does

7089.829 --> 7097.53
take up time and energy and and

7093.84 --> 7101.32
resources so yeah I totally get that and

7097.53 --> 7104.92
for me doing this daily show also is

7101.32 --> 7108.849
kind of setting yeah the rest of

7104.92 --> 7110.679
everything because I do plan around this

7108.849 --> 7112.900000000001
show well exactly

7110.679 --> 7114.969
that's what's awesome for the men to say

7112.9 --> 7116.44
so it's not like you can just simply say

7114.969 --> 7119.409
to yourself I'm going out for the day

7116.44 --> 7121.268999999999
and I'm gonna go and go walk in and

7119.409 --> 7122.739
climb this hill that's a few miles away

7121.269 --> 7125.349
so I'm gonna be out all day doing this

7122.739 --> 7127.0
just just me and and nature but you

7125.349 --> 7128.349
can't do that because you know you have

7127.0 --> 7129.76
a schedule to keep

7128.349 --> 7131.559
and you have to be here for your

7129.76 --> 7133.719
audience to keep your slop and so the

7131.559 --> 7136.2300000000005
people don't you know only turn away

7133.719 --> 7141.0
when you're not there one day right no

7136.23 --> 7142.289
it will do it sometimes like last time I

7141.0 --> 7146.17
[Music]

7142.289 --> 7149.679
Sunday last week I did skip it because

7146.17 --> 7152.38
yeah I was invited by a new D&D group

7149.679 --> 7154.36
and yeah I'm not gonna skip that because

7152.38 --> 7156.55
I really want to play that again

7154.36 --> 7160.239
but yeah that's not gonna be a regular

7156.55 --> 7162.610000000001
thing and they if I would like to go out

7160.239 --> 7165.48
in nature then I I might actually do

7162.61 --> 7170.848999999999
that and just take my EP 900 with me and

7165.48 --> 7170.848999999999
then yeah do two things at the same time

7171.269 --> 7176.4400000000005
but I gotta get the p900 first although

7174.219 --> 7177.01
with all these super chats go coming in

7176.44 --> 7178.808999999999
today

7177.01 --> 7182.67
and might actually get there really

7178.809 --> 7187.71
quickly see where I am in it you can buy

7182.67 --> 7187.71
second-hand p9 on just now let me see

7189.57 --> 7198.039
wee-bey think those what is it the mass

7193.65 --> 7200.379999999999
the mass buying there was something

7198.039 --> 7201.46
there was to to get it really quick

7200.38 --> 7209.06
cheap right

7201.46 --> 7212.0
so you 250 quid 300 quid 300 quid

7209.06 --> 7215.63
that's not bad that's a lot cheaper than

7212.0 --> 7219.74
Balak Romney I have no idea how much it

7215.63 --> 7230.0
costs brand-new and let's get rid of the

7219.74 --> 7234.349999999999
eBay part we'll come up to the Omni all

7230.0 --> 7236.0
right um face that is new Wow they've

7234.35 --> 7239.14
come substantially down in price

7236.0 --> 7242.48
hey don't you love mass production

7239.14 --> 7245.780000000001
that's the advantage of everyone wanting

7242.48 --> 7248.719999999999
one they buy one then industry will get

7245.78 --> 7251.63
the signal like who apparently a lot of

7248.72 --> 7253.85
people want this that means we can now

7251.63 --> 7256.79
produce it on a grander scale which

7253.85 --> 7264.5
makes it all cheaper that's a big

7256.79 --> 7266.54
advantage of yeah you can pick now for

7264.5 --> 7270.35
about three hundred and three hundred

7266.54 --> 7274.97
and thirty pound I'm name that's very

7270.35 --> 7281.360000000001
cool well I will try as soon as I can

7274.97 --> 7284.2300000000005
let's see let's see where I am at it's

7281.36 --> 7284.23
kind of hard to

7288.25 --> 7299.17
find it

7290.349 --> 7302.319
so weird extract explore YouTube revenue

7299.17 --> 7302.319
[Music]

7306.949 --> 7314.889999999999
all right that seems to be at a hundred

7309.92 --> 7318.05
seventy-one roughly not bad

7314.89 --> 7321.71
how much sorry two hundred and seventy

7318.05 --> 7327.71

7357.86 --> 7373.13
for the p1000 I have no problem doing

7360.77 --> 7376.6900000000005
that but if you guys could keep donating

7373.13 --> 7381.46
to superjet it'll happen soon enough

7376.69 --> 7385.19
guys for just a few weeks now I think

7381.46 --> 7387.89
right show was outside your um house

7385.19 --> 7389.509999999999
let's see how far you can see what we're

7387.89 --> 7393.88
looking at would you do observations

7389.51 --> 7393.88
where you live oh yeah absolutely

7406.09 --> 7408.62
listen how I'm supposed to be flat

7408.23 --> 7414.919999999999
anyway

7408.62 --> 7420.71
yeah it's River no how's your guy out

7414.92 --> 7424.07
there oh yeah oh yeah definitely and the

7420.71 --> 7427.35
moon as well and the sunrise I can see

7424.07 --> 7430.429999999999
it's usually right there

7427.35 --> 7433.860000000001
like this morning the Sun came up right

7430.43 --> 7437.34
behind those trees I saw the Sun Rise

7433.86 --> 7439.759999999999
today because I got up so early it was

7437.34 --> 7439.76
pretty cool

7440.11 --> 7444.82
but yeah I can't look like one of the

7442.84 --> 7449.41
first things I really want to do with it

7444.82 --> 7451.63
is get some serious more footage you'd

7449.41 --> 7454.0599999999995
be better with ap1000 honestly I mean

7451.63 --> 7456.31
having used both cameras the p900 and

7454.06 --> 7458.71
the p1000 business fast difference

7456.31 --> 7459.9400000000005
between the quality you get with ap1000

7458.71 --> 7461.8
oh definitely

7459.94 --> 7469.839999999999
isn't there I saw a fast price

7461.8 --> 7474.900000000001
difference yeah that's just about in

7469.84 --> 7474.900000000001
price but I mean for something like them

7478.14 --> 7484.990000000001
okay well I'll think about it

7482.28 --> 7489.7
yeah by the way guys we've been going

7484.99 --> 7496.54
for over two hours now I know yeah just

7489.7 --> 7498.389999999999
died let's just get into it yeah man

7496.54 --> 7501.36
yeah well you've been on the show for

7498.39 --> 7503.530000000001
for more than one and a half hours I

7501.36 --> 7511.75
might have to go live lighting myself

7503.53 --> 7512.889999999999
that if you can around oh no oh all

7511.75 --> 7515.71
right

7512.89 --> 7517.150000000001
well I am kind of hungry as well so I

7515.71 --> 7520.09
really want to get lunch for these

7517.15 --> 7529.0599999999995
moments but yeah I do really appreciate

7520.09 --> 7533.8
you two being on and Thank You Randy if

7529.06 --> 7535.240000000001
I'm around without them coming say

7533.8 --> 7537.91
doesn't want it to jump on today because

7535.24 --> 7541.0599999999995
it's not not working so it's not allowed

7537.91 --> 7546.5199999999995
[ __ ] where I am sure you guys can hear

7541.06 --> 7549.660000000001
me today so that's cool yeah you are

7546.52 --> 7553.96
sound oh I forgot to put my own volume

7549.66 --> 7556.68
yeah that's annoying so I've been

7553.96 --> 7560.71
probably not very loud all day oh well

7556.68 --> 7564.400000000001
yeah I by the way I am fixing it I I

7560.71 --> 7567.43
also am fixing that because I have to

7564.4 --> 7571.03
install the whole audio banana thingy an

7567.43 --> 7573.070000000001
audio cable and all that and I am going

7571.03 --> 7574.99
to do it cuz you asked me about an intro

7573.07 --> 7578.29
do you have an intro Shona

7574.99 --> 7585.03
yes we're working on it we're working on

7578.29 --> 7590.86
very beginning to loud too loud yeah

7585.03 --> 7593.74
yeah anyway yeah I am making an intro

7590.86 --> 7596.86
video there's no intro text or anything

7593.74 --> 7599.44
it's just birds and a song that fresh

7596.86 --> 7601.75
berry made that I really think is pretty

7599.44 --> 7632.589999999999
cool it's a boy we're not gonna see you

7601.75 --> 7635.25
running across the rooftops in the now

7632.59 --> 7639.1
but I will definitely at some point

7635.25 --> 7645.55
probably make a video of me using my bow

7639.1 --> 7646.75
to shoot Globes yeah honestly now we can

7645.55 --> 7649.45
Karen B kills it

7646.75 --> 7654.91
with that sexy video [ __ ] destroying

7649.45 --> 7665.86
that go with that gun it's a good

7654.91 --> 7668.22
practice for that oh haha alright hey

7665.86 --> 7671.58
see you two later thanks for coming man

7668.22 --> 7671.58
yeah no worries

7679.679 --> 7691.2300000000005
all right oh well that was a interesting

7685.65 --> 7699.839999999999
big show so I was thinking maybe I

7691.23 --> 7702.0
should play that intro just just for

7699.84 --> 7709.219
good measure to give you kind of hints

7702.0 --> 7709.219
of what I was planning to do let's see

7711.73 --> 7723.48
I don't wait let me find it it's still a

7719.64 --> 7723.4800000000005
draft basically

7730.679 --> 7735.17
alright presented

7739.82 --> 7748.549999999999
and then present it in OBS I think the

7746.36 --> 7751.96
sound will probably get through so yeah

7748.55 --> 7754.4890000000005
this was kind of the intro thingy and

7751.96 --> 7756.46
yeah Chris Barry made the music I

7754.489 --> 7758.178999999999
thought it was pretty cool it's basic

7756.46 --> 7761.27
but I like it

7758.179 --> 7763.54
it's short and that's good so here you

7761.27 --> 7763.540000000001
go

7771.98 --> 7793.08
[Music]

7790.25 --> 7795.92
that was it and yeah

7793.08 --> 7795.92
very basic

7802.709 --> 7806.09
it's that what do you guys think

7807.999 --> 7815.969
yeah lovelies I like the birds I thought

7813.13 --> 7818.289
it was cool and yeah there's no title

7815.969 --> 7821.8
animated cards or anything in there but

7818.289 --> 7823.36
yeah Dave and I asked over a month ago

7821.8 --> 7827.860000000001
can somebody help me with that

7823.36 --> 7830.679
and been ignored ever since so I'm just

7827.86 --> 7832.989
gonna work out the sound because that

7830.679 --> 7835.78
seems to be a little bit of an issue

7832.989 --> 7838.509999999999
chris is now also working on that with

7835.78 --> 7840.309
me and then we'll have this and yeah

7838.51 --> 7842.769
until somebody actually helped me out

7840.309 --> 7844.599
with getting appropriate and I made a

7842.769 --> 7848.650000000001
title card for that it's just gonna be

7844.599 --> 7854.1900000000005
this and I'm probably gonna start

7848.65 --> 7857.699
implementing it at the hundreds show so

7854.19 --> 7860.289
yeah I'm gonna round out now definitely

7857.699 --> 7864.129999999999
