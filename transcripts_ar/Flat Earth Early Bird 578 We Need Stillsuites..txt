join button that will be much

72.53 --> 86.27
appreciated and yeah today this is it's

82.46 --> 88.52
the hottest day that I had here so far

86.27 --> 93.92
it's so freaky warm it's just

88.52 --> 97.1
unbelievable I almost thought like maybe

93.92 --> 99.68
I should go shirtless but yeah it's it's

97.1 --> 104.83999999999999
funny because like right after 2 o'clock

99.68 --> 108.59
the Sun stops hitting my window as you

104.84 --> 112.49000000000001
can see and yeah it immediately cools

108.59 --> 115.25
off so I've been providing the birds

112.49 --> 118.45899999999999
over there are plenty of bats like 3

115.25 --> 121.97
times a day because they're like choking

118.459 --> 127.539
on this heat and it's nice to see them

121.97 --> 130.45
at least take a splash continually and

127.539 --> 133.7
then quickly go to the shadows of a tree

130.45 --> 137.66
but yeah it's hot hot hot there's a lot

133.7 --> 140.98999999999998
of this stuff up there I don't know if

137.66 --> 143.99
it's originally chemtrails or something

140.99 --> 145.58
it almost does look like it but this

143.99 --> 147.56
point it doesn't really matter if that's

145.58 --> 149.69000000000003
gonna help some cloud formation at some

147.56 --> 153.5
point that I'm kind of glad of it

149.69 --> 154.64
because this is just so freakin hot it's

153.5 --> 159.38
not even funny anymore

154.64 --> 162.98
uh and I'm gonna have to do my newspaper

159.38 --> 167.239
rounded this I was up very early today

162.98 --> 170.689
so I I thought like oh yeah yeah okay

167.239 --> 174.23000000000002
I'll just quickly do it when it's even

170.689 --> 175.54999999999998
doable just went out signs like oh my

174.23 --> 181.19
god it's

175.55 --> 184.52
already too hot and that was like 9

181.19 --> 189.29
o'clock anyway I got plenty of stuff

184.52 --> 196.66000000000003
with me today I got some big glass a

189.29 --> 203.5
grapefruit juice then I put in a cooler

196.66 --> 205.97
before this and of course green tea

203.5 --> 207.86
although that being warm and all not

205.97 --> 211.27
being very is not very appealing to me

207.86 --> 215.42000000000002
and the special bonus mm-hmm

211.27 --> 217.22
mini watermelon then I put quite a lot

215.42 --> 221.29999999999998
of work in this getting all the seeds

217.22 --> 230.48
out of there also put that in the in the

221.3 --> 231.73000000000002
fridge it's a really good one nice and

230.48 --> 238.03
sweet

231.73 --> 238.03
lots of aroma it's been a while

238.2 --> 241.2
mmm

246.56 --> 261.44
hmm yeah there's still some seeds in

248.42 --> 270.28999999999996
there very small hmm I'll take those

261.44 --> 275.18
seats for granted hmm so let's see who

270.29 --> 278.66
is in chat and this Wednesday okay

275.18 --> 280.1
hmm was first as usual the last few

278.66 --> 285.62
weeks

280.1 --> 287.94
Steve Mandy young Missouri bear Giulio

285.62 --> 289.15
Pepin good to see you

287.94 --> 295.63
[Music]

289.15 --> 295.63
Robin Stanley let's see you Tom Parker

296.53 --> 310.30999999999995
good servants Walter hojae dank and a

303.77 --> 312.7
koala I think I got you oh yeah good to

310.31 --> 312.7
see you all

321.91 --> 331.37
so it's hot

323.66 --> 333.65000000000003
I went to bed early oh really glad that

331.37 --> 335.509
I did I needed to catch up on some sleep

333.65 --> 337.19
from yesterday because technically I

335.509 --> 339.8
think I slept like only four hours

337.19 --> 342.21999999999997
yesterday and then it just became too

339.8 --> 342.22
hot

351.7 --> 355.46999999999997
okay Tony Parker weird

362.28 --> 371.229
oh yeah yeah yeah you got a problem and

369.009 --> 373.03000000000003
today even more than yesterday because

371.229 --> 377.74
yesterday was already pretty hot now

373.03 --> 381.42999999999995
it's just crazy I bet like the beaches

377.74 --> 383.47
are like absolutely insanely crowded I

381.43 --> 386.5
hope they're not gonna be subjected to

383.47 --> 389.379
some Corona measure nonsense because

386.5 --> 392.319
that's gonna get people really pissed

389.379 --> 401.34900000000005
off it's like no let me to the damn

392.319 --> 403.75
water now but yeah this is a good time

401.349 --> 411.759
to have a parasol or something like that

403.75 --> 415.09
a good very very dark preferably

411.759 --> 417.969
something a parasol to keep that Sun off

415.09 --> 419.919
you and then yeah it's it's doable with

417.969 --> 424.509
you if you if you have a nice spot where

419.919 --> 427.99
there's a breeze but yeah the water is

424.509 --> 430.659
better I'm gonna I'm sure utley gonna

427.99 --> 432.40000000000003
take a cold shower later on today but

430.659 --> 435.4
I'm gonna wait until after the freakin

432.4 --> 441.58
newspaper or maybe I should do it before

435.4 --> 442.719
just to freshen up enough mm but yeah

441.58 --> 446.81899999999996
I'm not looking forward to it

442.719 --> 446.819
thankfully it's not too long a routine

449.4 --> 453.69899999999996
and to be fair when it's this hot it is

452.259 --> 454.75
kind of fun to do it because there's

453.699 --> 456.61
always going to be a lot of people

454.75 --> 460.87
outside and it's always friendly mood

456.61 --> 466.75
and chatting in and it's funny because

460.87 --> 468.43
they know who I am now it's yeah they

466.75 --> 470.199
don't know a lot about me but they've

468.43 --> 473.169
seen me plenty of times and they know

470.199 --> 475.889
that I'm a really good guy and always

473.169 --> 475.889
trying to be nice

477.129 --> 485.73900000000003
straw hat yeah yeah that would also work

480.58 --> 489.24899999999997
like big bears uh what is it this is

485.739 --> 494.63899999999995
special Korean hat that thing his rice

489.249 --> 494.639
pickers hat that would work great too I

498.509 --> 503.16900000000004
probably would stick it to just wearing

501.61 --> 505.149
it in the garden because it probably

503.169 --> 513.0889999999999
looks a bit odd to walk with that out

505.149 --> 513.089
there but it is very effective hat

522.74 --> 533.72
close the window and curtains yeah but

530.36 --> 538.0
unfortunately my curtains are kind of

533.72 --> 541.85
improvised so they don't entirely close

538.0 --> 544.69
it's a bit unfortunate and even if they

541.85 --> 547.88
would you know they're still gonna be

544.69 --> 549.23
subjected to the sunlight on the inside

547.88 --> 554.33
of the window so they're still gonna

549.23 --> 556.04
collect heat this is just no no handling

554.33 --> 557.0
the heat situation here there are summer

556.04 --> 560.12
I'm used to it

557.0 --> 562.28
you know last year too I had plenty of

560.12 --> 565.73
shows where I went completely shirtless

562.28 --> 567.35
even because I guess that if I wouldn't

565.73 --> 571.36
be wearing a white shirt and I for some

567.35 --> 574.1
reason was objecting to that back then I

571.36 --> 576.34
heard him freakin wear a black shirt and

574.1 --> 582.44
this heat no freakin way

576.34 --> 587.02
wait radical shirtless unless I was like

582.44 --> 587.0200000000001
outside doing stuff

595.28 --> 602.75
yeah Roche well if only I had learned

599.45 --> 607.9100000000001
that properly when I was young because I

602.75 --> 611.09
only started doing this four or five

607.91 --> 613.91
years ago and it's really silly because

611.09 --> 615.9200000000001
my dad used to always be pushing me like

613.91 --> 620.24
just do a freaking newspaper round since

615.92 --> 625.61
I was 12 and I hated it and this like I

620.24 --> 627.59
really hated it but then yeah I just I

625.61 --> 631.3100000000001
needed to do it for I guess

627.59 --> 633.5300000000001
therapeutical reasons and to be exposed

631.31 --> 635.81
have the reasons to be exposed to other

633.53 --> 639.92
people and have a function and represent

635.81 --> 644.06
that and that's something that it's kind

639.92 --> 645.4699999999999
of a rare commodity to me so when I

644.06 --> 647.68
approached it like that and just say I

645.47 --> 653.03
screwed money it's completely useless

647.68 --> 655.79
but people are happy with it and it yeah

653.03 --> 657.86
it's a it's a good thing to do something

655.79 --> 661.04
an a I got very efficient at it like

657.86 --> 664.04
really freaking if it I can just does

661.04 --> 666.14
not even look and just grab fold that

664.04 --> 672.9499999999999
[ __ ] on the spot and with one hand just

666.14 --> 674.48
shove it in with gloves I got really

672.95 --> 676.3100000000001
freaking efficient at it because that's

674.48 --> 678.98
just how my mind works that's how I do

676.31 --> 681.7399999999999
things and it's insane because it's like

678.98 --> 684.5600000000001
yeah I'm super professional quick for

681.74 --> 688.339
something that literally yeah

684.56 --> 692.18
it's financially not worth it but that's

688.339 --> 698.24
not what I do it for and besides this

692.18 --> 700.04
way I could always step away without

698.24 --> 704.15
being like oh but then I got this

700.04 --> 705.98
financial gap or something so yeah it I

704.15 --> 709.31
don't know it sounds really weird I

705.98 --> 712.63
guess to a lot of people out there but

709.31 --> 712.63
to me that's just how it went

715.29 --> 720.9699999999999
and like the idea of doing such things

717.81 --> 724.93
full-time does not appeal to me at all

720.97 --> 727.03
besides yeah regularly things that I

724.93 --> 731.28
read in a freaking paper that I have to

727.03 --> 734.29
distribute yet kind of I don't like it

731.28 --> 736.18
so I'm not all that full in on it you

734.29 --> 741.43
know it's still freaking newspapers now

736.18 --> 747.27
it's it's local it's like in my city

741.43 --> 750.64
local like it's about my city so it's

747.27 --> 757.36
yeah I don't know that just makes it

750.64 --> 759.73
okay and it's not yeah there's just a

757.36 --> 762.46
lot of regular things going on in there

759.73 --> 764.59
and not always pushing propoganda it's

762.46 --> 769.48
not always doing that

764.59 --> 777.6700000000001
so it only sometimes doing that anyway

769.48 --> 782.8000000000001
yeah but that's newspaper ads because I

777.67 --> 785.8299999999999
used to do the mail to like for the mail

782.8 --> 789.9599999999999
company in the Netherlands a very basic

785.83 --> 793.75
[ __ ] but I hate it it's so badly I

789.96 --> 796.39
really despise doing it at first I liked

793.75 --> 797.98
doing it you know because it's like yeah

796.39 --> 800.14
but basically what I'm doing right now

797.98 --> 801.82
I'm just doing something mechanical I

800.14 --> 803.62
can keep my mind off things to think

801.82 --> 806.23
about dream about while I'm doing thing

803.62 --> 809.83
getting more efficient it's fulfilling

806.23 --> 813.61
but yeah when I did it back then I had

809.83 --> 819.0400000000001
to sit in between other people that were

813.61 --> 822.07
really [ __ ] depressed and that was

819.04 --> 824.29
kind of like Rob there are I was just

822.07 --> 826.3900000000001
constantly robbing over me and so I

824.29 --> 829.39
became really miserable I even tried to

826.39 --> 831.61
talk to some of them and like almost got

829.39 --> 833.26
into fights and [ __ ] the atmosphere

831.61 --> 834.34
sometimes people will be fighting

833.26 --> 836.05
amongst themselves

834.34 --> 838.5400000000001
it was a terrible atmosphere at the time

836.05 --> 840.67
it might have improved a lot you know it

838.54 --> 843.3399999999999
might just be coincidental that it was

840.67 --> 845.7099999999999
just doing something there was just [ __ ]

843.34 --> 846.72
going down there locally and I was in a

845.71 --> 851.009
very bad

846.72 --> 864.48
I'm in my life emotionally but yeah I

851.009 --> 868.1990000000001
freaking hated that even though the pay

864.48 --> 871.589
was at least decent compared to like

868.199 --> 873.569
newspapers but yeah if you wouldn't do

871.589 --> 875.2790000000001
newspapers professionally it's all about

873.569 --> 884.459
the quantity and I just don't like that

875.279 --> 887.519
at all about anyway yeah the blah blah

884.459 --> 894.42
blah stupid jobs that's not what you

887.519 --> 898.319
came to the show for a Guns of Navarone

894.42 --> 900.779
RMP are you doing lunar eclipses the

898.319 --> 903.81
forth is that true I wouldn't know

900.779 --> 906.75
I'm not the guy to ask who is there the

903.81 --> 913.8599999999999
celestial thing gonna happen soon I'm

906.75 --> 917.1
not really the guy now if you want a

913.86 --> 920.73
in-depth opinion from me as to what

917.1 --> 923.129
something could be now I'm open for that

920.73 --> 924.6
kind of question but you don't like I

923.129 --> 929.149
don't know when all these things happen

924.6 --> 929.149
I know about it because you guys tell me

935.69 --> 939.8000000000001
julieopp happened that's just terrible

948.12 --> 954.25
no but going shirtless outside is also

951.85 --> 958.39
not very good because I will have too

954.25 --> 960.52
much Sun directly exposed to my skin you

958.39 --> 964.21
know if I'm constantly hanging around in

960.52 --> 967.21
the shadows that's one thing but because

964.21 --> 969.5500000000001
it's so in Karen tu when it's evening

967.21 --> 971.9200000000001
I'm gonna be shirtless like in the dark

969.55 --> 975.5799999999999
and [ __ ] hanging on the roof just being

971.92 --> 978.01
like Oh finally skulls oh yeah but when

975.58 --> 981.49
the Sun is out I'm not gonna go

978.01 --> 984.25
completely or almost entirely naked

981.49 --> 988.15
unless there is like a pool near and a

984.25 --> 989.98
parasol or something it's just otherwise

988.15 --> 992.4399999999999
I'll get overheated in no time and not

989.98 --> 995.2
even realize it or I'll get you know

992.44 --> 999.4000000000001
what is it the sunstroke and [ __ ] not

995.2 --> 1001.62
good I'm already going outside without a

999.4 --> 1003.15
hat and I probably should be wearing

1001.62 --> 1007.47
some kind of a hat but I don't really

1003.15 --> 1015.47
have a hat that would be weird to me

1007.47 --> 1017.61
doing wearing a hat guy I could wear hat

1015.47 --> 1021.36
but it's just something I've never

1017.61 --> 1025.56
really done I guess I did used to wear a

1021.36 --> 1031.5
cap so when I was young but yeah that

1025.56 --> 1037.85
that ended pretty quickly when I

1031.5 --> 1037.85
realized that I kind of look gay I know

1038.75 --> 1043.22
what's this word nipple nonsense

1059.36 --> 1064.6399999999999
I had on that big do you think I'm going

1062.96 --> 1067.6000000000001
out in this weather in the leather

1064.64 --> 1072.5
jacket are you insane

1067.6 --> 1075.74
that's it it's not a it's not a Fremen

1072.5 --> 1077.09
steel suit okay that would be cool to

1075.74 --> 1078.89
have really in this weather

1077.09 --> 1082.58
that would be really awesome I wish

1078.89 --> 1083.15
those things were real that would be so

1082.58 --> 1084.82
awesome

1083.15 --> 1089.3200000000002
like a diver suit you could just walk

1084.82 --> 1093.309
walk without side enough flexibility and

1089.32 --> 1096.23
yeah it just uses your body system to

1093.309 --> 1103.4189999999999
provide temperature decrease and all

1096.23 --> 1103.419
that and even drink in a good way

1104.62 --> 1107.6799999999998
[Music]

1109.78 --> 1114.79
man wait the scale said you could

1111.98 --> 1122.809
literally on feet cross the desert I

1114.79 --> 1124.6299999999999
think how about that but if you never

1122.809 --> 1130.16
heard of that it's from the book doom

1124.63 --> 1133.3700000000001
the you and II from Frank Herbert's and

1130.16 --> 1136.8200000000002
the Fremen on dune which is as a desert

1133.37 --> 1139.7299999999998
planet were the locals and the locals

1136.82 --> 1143.75
they survived very very well to the

1139.73 --> 1147.59
surprise of all the outsiders attempting

1143.75 --> 1149.96
to colonize it for the spice and the

1147.59 --> 1153.32
Fremen did get around especially because

1149.96 --> 1157.49
they had all kinds of adaptive ways and

1153.32 --> 1159.86
technology mainly distill suit and still

1157.49 --> 1163.67
suit is like it just looks like a kind

1159.86 --> 1166.3999999999999
of a black rubbery suit and the game

1163.67 --> 1172.309
dune yeah that's where that's where it

1166.4 --> 1174.8000000000002
started with me really a lot doom to I

1172.309 --> 1177.3799999999999
knew about that game it was the very

1174.8 --> 1182.87
first strategy game I ever played on my

1177.38 --> 1186.95
Amiga 1200 and it was amazing for the

1182.87 --> 1189.05
time being it was like the first serious

1186.95 --> 1189.44
kind of strategy game that I've ever

1189.05 --> 1191.6
played

1189.44 --> 1193.88
they probably command & Conquer was

1191.6 --> 1196.1299999999999
first but they were very close second

1193.88 --> 1199.7
and they had that they had a lot of like

1196.13 --> 1202.97
good drawn cutscenes and Shedden based

1199.7 --> 1208.07
on the movie got a little creative with

1202.97 --> 1211.25
it with the Ordos and yeah I thought

1208.07 --> 1213.97
that was an awesome game my first

1211.25 --> 1213.97
strategy game

1219.17 --> 1226.95
but after that I also have never really

1223.05 --> 1228.69
read the book it's silly I never did it

1226.95 --> 1230.6100000000001
I know a lot of people that told me

1228.69 --> 1232.8600000000001
about what they read in the book yeah

1230.61 --> 1234.75
yeah I'm I don't know why I just never

1232.86 --> 1237.51
read the book I have it even I think I

1234.75 --> 1239.63
don't know where but I've seen the

1237.51 --> 1243.3
movies and I've seen the miniseries and

1239.63 --> 1245.94
played all the games like all the games

1243.3 --> 1249.9199999999998
I was a I'm a great doom fan always have

1245.94 --> 1255.45
been I was yeah

1249.92 --> 1259.68
anyway it's also because of the main

1255.45 --> 1264.9
character Paul tradies kind of tends to

1259.68 --> 1267.18
appeal to me also the custom the name

1264.9 --> 1269.6100000000001
but also because he was kind of an

1267.18 --> 1271.68
outsider and he basically the story of

1269.61 --> 1276.6899999999998
him was basically being thrown in the

1271.68 --> 1279.66
deep and not really yeah it was a giant

1276.69 --> 1284.22
trial of adulthood and then basically

1279.66 --> 1285.5400000000002
into some destined near godhood and that

1284.22 --> 1289.95
whole thing yeah that appealed to me

1285.54 --> 1296.6499999999999
greatly it's another form I guess of

1289.95 --> 1299.709
Canada story buildup of baldur's gate so

1296.65 --> 1299.709
[Music]

1304.36 --> 1309.9699999999998
yes sting did play in there and that's

1306.55 --> 1314.59
right played a bad guy and it was very

1309.97 --> 1320.8
fitting in retrospect and he played it

1314.59 --> 1324.1
very well not that he had a lot of real

1320.8 --> 1326.29
acting but he was very much it was like

1324.1 --> 1329.56
viscerally into that character like he

1326.29 --> 1331.03
was really radiating that [ __ ] so I was

1329.56 --> 1337.3899999999999
a little bit too much into it

1331.03 --> 1339.28
right yeah the old movie is impressive

1337.39 --> 1341.8600000000001
and the newer mini series are also

1339.28 --> 1348.18
pretty good in their own ways but the

1341.86 --> 1348.1799999999998
old one yeah was it's very interesting

1355.23 --> 1361.3990000000001
anyway get some more of this

1372.72 --> 1383.58
so really it a remake are you serious

1376.29 --> 1389.28
a gem holy [ __ ] well that could mean all

1383.58 --> 1391.37
kinds of things though you know it

1389.28 --> 1393.66
doesn't necessarily have to be good but

1391.37 --> 1400.8899999999999
that's interesting I didn't even know

1393.66 --> 1403.25
that I hope they don't screw it up too

1400.89 --> 1403.25
bad be

1419.57 --> 1422.1699999999998
what

1424.35 --> 1429.9189999999999
oh talking about the garden Missouri

1427.649 --> 1429.9189999999999
bear

1453.62 --> 1462.75
Wow by the way ya own Benjamin was going

1457.05 --> 1467.55
hard at it again against against the

1462.75 --> 1470.55
Pope and the Vatican as a yeah with good

1467.55 --> 1476.48
reasons of course laid it out pretty

1470.55 --> 1479.01
pretty thick on to it that was good I

1476.48 --> 1483.15
almost don't really need to repeat it

1479.01 --> 1486.15
you know I've personally kind of put

1483.15 --> 1492.27
down that that situation here on my show

1486.15 --> 1495.7800000000002
too like way back so I'm kind of

1492.27 --> 1500.87
thrilled that yeah he he really gets it

1495.78 --> 1503.57
he really gets it just yeah

1500.87 --> 1507.59
the penis hats and all that yeah yeah

1503.57 --> 1507.59
yeah of course all that [ __ ]

1512.8 --> 1518.34
what Gillian sick-out line

1539.61 --> 1546.03
all right yeah Missouri Barrett look how

1542.1 --> 1550.08
I see it it's it's really a inside-out

1546.03 --> 1551.1299999999999
world joke and yeah Owen Benjamin put

1550.08 --> 1553.52
that out pretty well

1551.13 --> 1557.5100000000002
like everything Christ basically said

1553.52 --> 1560.22
what not to do they're doing it and

1557.51 --> 1562.32
they're trying to hide it in plain sight

1560.22 --> 1565.82
it's just like now they're doing exactly

1562.32 --> 1570.24
the opposite of what Jesus says yet they

1565.82 --> 1581.1299999999999
claim to be the progenitors of that lore

1570.24 --> 1584.64
and all that and of his will it's pretty

1581.13 --> 1587.8500000000001
freaky when you start to really feel

1584.64 --> 1592.3500000000001
that then suddenly all that gold and all

1587.85 --> 1594.8999999999999
that is is just really creepy and it

1592.35 --> 1598.1399999999999
gets even worse you know they even try

1594.9 --> 1600.45
to get more artistic [ __ ] in there and

1598.14 --> 1602.73
it's really terrible art it's like

1600.45 --> 1606.3300000000002
really dark and [ __ ] and they do that

1602.73 --> 1609.929
too is it it's almost like yeah why

1606.33 --> 1613.28
aren't people getting that we are what

1609.929 --> 1616.16
we are let's put some more on there

1613.28 --> 1619.02
because people are just unwilling to

1616.16 --> 1626.45
figure out what's going on here what we

1619.02 --> 1626.45
are it's it's very weird to me

1645.71 --> 1652.27
I went wait what what are you talking

1650.09 --> 1652.27
about

1667.38 --> 1678.8700000000001
music has become dead well pop music you

1676.41 --> 1680.46
know and pop music is being forced in

1678.87 --> 1683.54
more than ever because it's not the

1680.46 --> 1687.66
standard platform to insert programming

1683.54 --> 1690.59
so it's like extra beefed up to be more

1687.66 --> 1694.3500000000001
in-your-face and more pushing away the

1690.59 --> 1698.3999999999999
real music that's still around really it

1694.35 --> 1701.2199999999998
is you can't get that away for real but

1698.4 --> 1704.5800000000002
yeah what you hear on the radio no yeah

1701.22 --> 1710.04
that's just terrible a lot of it or just

1704.58 --> 1712.59
really boring like yeah we get it you

1710.04 --> 1715.23
chose to do it like this because you

1712.59 --> 1724.23
thought it was popular that kind of [ __ ]

1715.23 --> 1727.1100000000001
Oh get away from me but it doesn't mean

1724.23 --> 1730.74
there's not any good music around you'd

1727.11 --> 1732.6299999999999
be surprised if you just don't hear a

1730.74 --> 1735.48
lot about it and it's almost like people

1732.63 --> 1738.0200000000002
that do make very good music realize

1735.48 --> 1740.31
like no we don't want to get too much

1738.02 --> 1744.36
spotlight because somebody will try to

1740.31 --> 1749.3999999999999
ruin it just do what we do in our space

1744.36 --> 1753.4199999999998
and there's still plenty of good music

1749.4 --> 1756.69
out there but you got to find it it it

1753.42 --> 1760.5900000000001
doesn't come rolling on to the front

1756.69 --> 1765.42
lines in your face you know I found a

1760.59 --> 1768.3899999999999
lot of great music here on YouTube it's

1765.42 --> 1770.0700000000002
just there and it's incredible I think

1768.39 --> 1773.76
there's still some programming and you

1770.07 --> 1776.31
don't but still it's like I can still

1773.76 --> 1779.21
pick it up I can still realize I see the

1776.31 --> 1783.1499999999999
program resonating it's like these songs

1779.21 --> 1786.18
mean ten different things over time it's

1783.15 --> 1788.67
incredible just a themed song about a

1786.18 --> 1791.01
certain specific visceral subject in a

1788.67 --> 1794.0700000000002
certain experience and just expressing

1791.01 --> 1795.78
that musically and then you've reflected

1794.07 --> 1800.55
on what's going on in the world and it's

1795.78 --> 1802.74
insane on how many situations certainly

1800.55 --> 1805.29
the same song just gets a different

1802.74 --> 1811.47
context and it and it works and it's

1805.29 --> 1813.18
like whoa dude holy [ __ ] and I'm not

1811.47 --> 1814.92
talking about the Beatles are all that

1813.18 --> 1819.3600000000001
[ __ ] now I'm talking about advanced

1814.92 --> 1823.6200000000001
electronic music deep house it's

1819.36 --> 1826.29
categorized in I think but yeah not all

1823.62 --> 1828.03
of that is good but there is just so

1826.29 --> 1830.1599999999999
many credible gems in between there and

1828.03 --> 1834.6299999999999
yeah I've collected them over the years

1830.16 --> 1840.03
I listen to it often before the show

1834.63 --> 1843.18
starts - yeah because they do give me a

1840.03 --> 1844.98
good and active vibe a lot of them or

1843.18 --> 1848.18
they call me down in a good way that

1844.98 --> 1848.18
still keeps me active

1875.75 --> 1884.0
you like natural stuff composed by

1878.0 --> 1888.56
humans okay oh I do too but I do also

1884.0 --> 1891.25
enjoy some of just the things that can

1888.56 --> 1896.21
be accomplished with electronic music

1891.25 --> 1899.41
but yeah I do prefer like a classical

1896.21 --> 1899.41
Orchestra a lot

1899.83 --> 1904.8999999999999
well there's even like like combinations

1902.69 --> 1904.9
it's

1908.85 --> 1917.04
and I like folk music a lot an F even

1912.36 --> 1918.87
there's like electro folk also I didn't

1917.04 --> 1922.1
like it as much as just real

1918.87 --> 1922.1
instrumental folk

1928.64 --> 1931.24
yeah

1949.63 --> 1955.3300000000002
hmm right Giddings you mean from the

1952.6 --> 1960.1899999999998
mute the movie they used it they played

1955.33 --> 1961.809
it on synthesizer oh if you just

1960.19 --> 1964.059
generally heard that that might be

1961.809 --> 1965.6789999999999
somewhat like but that was a thing back

1964.059 --> 1969.58
then too you know it was like oh

1965.679 --> 1972.21
synthesizers electronic pianos and then

1969.58 --> 1976.23
they just tried it out like ooh let's

1972.21 --> 1976.23
let's make this fashionable

1982.0 --> 1989.47
there's like all these kind of hipster

1984.28 --> 1993.16
piano it's even like this Japanese guy

1989.47 --> 1996.13
back in the eighties I think who did

1993.16 --> 1997.63
that typically just took classical music

1996.13 --> 2001.3500000000001
and then started to played on his

1997.63 --> 2002.94
synthesizer even with weird effects in

2001.35 --> 2004.6799999999998
there and all that it's just like yeah

2002.94 --> 2006.48
that's something that people listen to

2004.68 --> 2009.63
back then because synthesizer was kind

2006.48 --> 2015.66
of new and like what is this this is

2009.63 --> 2023.75
different a lot of pop music had it too

2015.66 --> 2023.75
all of a sudden and rock and [ __ ] anyway

2036.02 --> 2044.57
yeah well do whatever you like

2040.01 --> 2048.679
UHN if but yeah I don't recommend it

2044.57 --> 2050.95
it's not good for you trust me I tried

2048.679 --> 2050.9500000000003
it

2057.98 --> 2066.02
dan I now must be inclined to say like

2063.619 --> 2069.71
oh oh really you like Gothic right oh

2066.02 --> 2071.96
well I got a I got a certain CD why

2069.71 --> 2075.139
don't you listen to that cuz that's

2071.96 --> 2076.82
gonna absolutely [ __ ] up your mind what

2075.139 --> 2082.2400000000002
yeah I don't do that anymore it's just

2076.82 --> 2087.2000000000003
like no I um I don't want to show them

2082.24 --> 2090.25
because it's just bad frequency that's

2087.2 --> 2090.25
what it slips into

2102.01 --> 2104.0400000000004
Oh

2136.83 --> 2145.89
no not really tiny wubble I'm a pretty

2142.08 --> 2148.2599999999998
good Whistler I guess I can sing

2145.89 --> 2150.54
somebody I just don't have a good

2148.26 --> 2156.3
singing voice not to my own liking

2150.54 --> 2158.2799999999997
anyway but yeah I wife I've played the

2156.3 --> 2160.23
flute but that's a long time ago I could

2158.28 --> 2167.28
relearn it but I don't really feel like

2160.23 --> 2169.83
it and I I tried a bit of guitar here

2167.28 --> 2174.27
and there but yeah never got the

2169.83 --> 2179.87
patience for it it bothered me too much

2174.27 --> 2179.87
on my fingers they got agitated too much

2198.43 --> 2203.94
true mentor always relationship what

2205.65 --> 2213.78
does that mean

2208.74 --> 2213.7799999999997
he Truman Show relation or something

2218.44 --> 2221.44
okay

2246.98 --> 2250.3
hey they miss Kang

2296.13 --> 2306.51
Oh God sorry guys I'm literally just

2304.38 --> 2308.9
starting to burn up here I don't know

2306.51 --> 2308.9
what it is

2322.38 --> 2327.35
drink some water I don't know

2332.46 --> 2341.9700000000003
I don't feel dehydrated I just feel like

2338.839 --> 2344.18
heat escape wanting to escape from me

2341.97 --> 2344.18
that

2360.809 --> 2365.009
yuck a gem

2387.18 --> 2395.0099999999998
feet in a bucket of cold water that's

2392.47 --> 2398.2
actually not a bad idea

2395.01 --> 2402.9300000000003
but yeah I just got 15 minutes left it's

2398.2 --> 2402.93
kind of too late I'm melting

2419.05 --> 2426.0600000000004
it's the cold feet challenge what

2443.69 --> 2454.64
okay this chat is just getting

2447.619 --> 2455.119
nonsensical here okay Raj I'll see you

2454.64 --> 2458.47
later

2455.119 --> 2458.4700000000003
keep it cool

2474.52 --> 2480.2
did anybody catch the little Flat Earth

2477.98 --> 2485.66
debate snippet Nathan premiered this

2480.2 --> 2488.96
morning it was pretty good was also the

2485.66 --> 2491.3599999999997
moment from the Hangout was it not

2488.96 --> 2496.79
yesterday the day before right I think

2491.36 --> 2499.1600000000003
from Monday the situation with the

2496.79 --> 2503.02
angular size of the Sun and people

2499.16 --> 2506.39
claiming that it changes angular size

2503.02 --> 2510.62
suggesting yeah that may be proof of

2506.39 --> 2515.15
some kind of proximity and I tried to go

2510.62 --> 2517.2999999999997
against it or what I did just put it

2515.15 --> 2517.3
down

2531.91 --> 2534.5389999999998
goody

2562.55 --> 2571.28
oh right yeah in Australia right so it's

2567.14 --> 2580.49
winter there it's so weird how that

2571.28 --> 2586.34
works it's so bizarre that literally on

2580.49 --> 2589.64
one side or one side of the realm it's

2586.34 --> 2591.9500000000003
super hot and on the other side it's

2589.64 --> 2607.0099999999998
literally freezing it's so weird how

2591.95 --> 2611.0499999999997
that works like how short effectively

2607.01 --> 2615.6800000000003
the range is between extreme temperature

2611.05 --> 2619.84
differences with extreme results and how

2615.68 --> 2619.8399999999997
close by that technically is it's like

2620.32 --> 2624.46
is it a thousand miles away

2631.099 --> 2637.819
it just makes me think that we probably

2634.96 --> 2641.979
completely misunderstand the very nature

2637.819 --> 2645.47
of how what seasons really are like why

2641.979 --> 2648.95
why a season can be in one place and

2645.47 --> 2656.0789999999997
then the opposite season can be not too

2648.95 --> 2656.0789999999997
far away find it quite surreal

2670.339 --> 2676.3089999999997
no tiny womble now that surrealism

2673.999 --> 2682.029
definitely does not make me think it's a

2676.309 --> 2682.029
globe not at all not even close

2686.609 --> 2693.989
it's still all just directly connected

2690.21 --> 2697.16
atmosphere or air you know it's in

2693.989 --> 2701.7
direct contact with one another like how

2697.16 --> 2704.46
can it be warm for sustainable period on

2701.7 --> 2707.64
one side even if you're gonna presuppose

2704.46 --> 2710.73
a ball and then cold on the other like

2707.64 --> 2712.92
really big differences for a prolonged

2710.73 --> 2718.529
time when the earth is supposedly

2712.92 --> 2721.0190000000002
spinning right so it's with daily cycle

2718.529 --> 2723.9
so how does this extreme temperature

2721.019 --> 2728.519
difference persist in these regions and

2723.9 --> 2730.4990000000003
makes no freakin sense on a globe on the

2728.519 --> 2739.14
globe the least it makes the least sense

2730.499 --> 2743.3089999999997
of everything makes even less sense than

2739.14 --> 2747.23
the supposed molten iron core idea less

2743.309 --> 2747.23
sense to me the seasons

2783.85 --> 2786.66
it

2791.14 --> 2801.54
a really unif you think that a globe is

2797.29 --> 2801.54
the most stable structure in a

2801.66 --> 2811.71
presupposed beginning where things for

2805.96 --> 2811.71
no reason came out of nothing or really

2827.73 --> 2835.68
you know technically if they don't

2831.81 --> 2837.81
address space reality itself like the

2835.68 --> 2840.72
confine of the universe they basically

2837.81 --> 2844.23
suggested is endless so if something is

2840.72 --> 2846.6299999999997
gonna explode from a central point where

2844.23 --> 2850.5
an infinite small point basically and

2846.63 --> 2854.7000000000003
then explode out right it's the material

2850.5 --> 2856.619
is going to settle because it's no

2854.7 --> 2860.31
longer extremely compacted and all that

2856.619 --> 2862.94
and yeah it fuses whatever right so it's

2860.31 --> 2868.56
also still expanding in all directions

2862.94 --> 2872.1
so how does do things then while

2868.56 --> 2875.63
exploding in all directions how do

2872.1 --> 2875.63
things settle in a globe

2882.54 --> 2888.84
Kate can you model that other than just

2885.7 --> 2895.0899999999997
a just so story I don't think so

2888.84 --> 2898.03
doesn't work that way like how would

2895.09 --> 2900.54
suppose it ball based gravity wells

2898.03 --> 2902.71
through the distribution of mass

2900.54 --> 2908.56
exploding in all directions how would

2902.71 --> 2910.93
they even form theoretically ah so way

2908.56 --> 2912.4
too far a theory for most people to even

2910.93 --> 2915.1
understand what the [ __ ] I'm talking

2912.4 --> 2916.7200000000003
about right now we're talking about the

2915.1 --> 2924.19
mechanics of us leave behind the Big

2916.72 --> 2926.5299999999997
Bang in infinite space confine ya Globes

2924.19 --> 2929.25
don't form when something is just

2926.53 --> 2932.67
perpetually exploding in all directions

2929.25 --> 2935.67
now it just spreads out it doesn't

2932.67 --> 2935.67
collect

2975.53 --> 2978.34
mm-hmm

2980.109 --> 2983.859
what it is good servant

2999.94 --> 3003.4500000000003
what question

3006.92 --> 3010.059
I didn't see it

3016.76 --> 3024.88
Oh what why would gravity collectors

3020.32 --> 3029.4500000000003
collect their at those spots right a

3024.88 --> 3032.54
good servant the other reason is kind of

3029.45 --> 3034.91
a self-fulfilling self-creating prophecy

3032.54 --> 3040.2799999999997
mainly because it's supposed to be

3034.91 --> 3042.47
happening because matter just the

3040.28 --> 3044.8100000000004
gravity basically reaches in all

3042.47 --> 3047.5099999999998
direction and then a critical mass like

3044.81 --> 3049.22
a mass where the gravity increases then

3047.51 --> 3051.4700000000003
continue it's the pulling everything

3049.22 --> 3055.22
towards that and it gets a momentum and

3051.47 --> 3059.0299999999997
then the ball forms but yeah that in my

3055.22 --> 3061.0899999999997
imagination can only happen in a

3059.03 --> 3063.3500000000004
situation where things have settled

3061.09 --> 3065.36
within the space of the container

3063.35 --> 3067.75
available which is supposed to be the

3065.36 --> 3071.75
yeah endless outerspace

3067.75 --> 3073.79
universe endless endless container it

3071.75 --> 3076.67
makes no sense because there's no point

3073.79 --> 3080.3
where it'll stop expanding so it can get

3076.67 --> 3083.78
to a point in order to settle in order

3080.3 --> 3087.92
to theoretically form gravity wells and

3083.78 --> 3089.9900000000002
balls yeah there you go for a big

3087.92 --> 3092.81
presuppositional problem in the

3089.99 --> 3094.8399999999997
mechanics and nobody in the Flat Earth

3092.81 --> 3098.69
debate is gonna give a [ __ ] about that

3094.84 --> 3101.4100000000003
but it's there though come across at

3098.69 --> 3101.41
before

3127.09 --> 3133.25
yeah and the only other theoretical

3130.28 --> 3137.5600000000004
possibility for matter to come together

3133.25 --> 3142.67
enough to format a gravity well would be

3137.56 --> 3146.7799999999997
if the explosion the Big Bang was not in

3142.67 --> 3148.9700000000003
all directions or rather in all

3146.78 --> 3150.65
directions and then things bouncing off

3148.97 --> 3152.75
the container if if there is something

3150.65 --> 3154.52
yeah but then you already got you don't

3152.75 --> 3156.2
have the infinite outer space universe

3154.52 --> 3158.87
because that just means that there's no

3156.2 --> 3162.4399999999996
way for matter to actually get closer

3158.87 --> 3165.08
because it's only expanding expanding

3162.44 --> 3168.17
meaning getting more diffused so how is

3165.08 --> 3171.0499999999997
it ever gonna find a chance to gather

3168.17 --> 3173.27
enough gravity momentum to bend space

3171.05 --> 3178.1200000000003
enough to find form of gravity well that

3173.27 --> 3189.37
cannot theoretically happen this is see

3178.12 --> 3191.21
see the problem this is all extremely

3189.37 --> 3193.94
presuppositional so sorry about that

3191.21 --> 3196.2400000000002
flat earthers probably got a headache

3193.94 --> 3196.2400000000002
now

3214.41 --> 3227.67
but the funny thing is though when the

3222.1 --> 3230.2
Big Bang story is told spoken so not the

3227.67 --> 3231.88
mechanical proof or formula for it or

3230.2 --> 3236.08
anything or calculation but just the

3231.88 --> 3239.1400000000003
story is told what I remember is every

3236.08 --> 3244.66
time they do say yeah Big Bang

3239.14 --> 3247.8689999999997
nothing point explodes then settles so

3244.66 --> 3251.92
that means that within the storytelling

3247.869 --> 3254.4100000000003
of it at least it does expand to fill

3251.92 --> 3259.9
the entire universe container it must

3254.41 --> 3262.33
have and then later I don't know new the

3259.9 --> 3264.58
crash Tyson type figures blah blah blah

3262.33 --> 3267.8199999999997
people then start saying oh maybe it

3264.58 --> 3270.64
keeps on expanding maybe it's not filled

3267.82 --> 3274.75
but then the Big Bang story would make

3270.64 --> 3277.95
any sense anymore I think this is kind

3274.75 --> 3277.95
of an older problem even

3283.109 --> 3294.589
hmm anyway I'm gonna round out the show

3290.329 --> 3297.119
sorry for being a bit slow so overheated

3294.589 --> 3300.89
but yeah that was kind of funny talking

3297.119 --> 3303.0190000000002
about the the Big Bang mechanics and the

3300.89 --> 3305.7889999999998
presuppositional problems with all that

3303.019 --> 3307.769
so yeah if you like to show them please

3305.789 --> 3309.2690000000002
don't forget to Rogen's it up and if you

3307.769 --> 3310.89
haven't already subscribed to my channel

3309.269 --> 3313.3489999999997

3332.489 --> 3339.359
this hash tag me found indeed over moco

3336.749 --> 3344.64
and Steve and yeah until the next video
