[Music]

32.81 --> 34.870000000000005
you

42.31 --> 44.370000000000005
you

52.239 --> 56.839999999999996
good

54.32 --> 62.72
morning welcome to Flat Earth early-bird

56.84 --> 65.9
number 455 yeah 54 right sorry

62.72 --> 66.44
welcome to early word number 454 I'm

65.9 --> 68.119
your host

66.44 --> 69.77
Arwen and before we start the show

68.119 --> 72.29
please don't forget to share it on any

69.77 --> 74.09
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

72.29 --> 75.74000000000001
already subscribed to my channel and hit

74.09 --> 77.75
the bell notification so you know when

75.74 --> 81.259
I'm going live just normally 2:00 p.m.

77.75 --> 83.06
amsterdam time every day please also do

81.259 --> 85.22
support me through the paypal patreon my

83.06 --> 86.38
GoFundMe in the superjet that will be

85.22 --> 93.31
much appreciated

86.38 --> 97.369
so yeah whether today is different again

93.31 --> 103.88
it seems to be less windy although it

97.369 --> 106.67
still has its moments and another pretty

103.88 --> 108.94
bright blue patches of sky here and

106.67 --> 113.75
there but there's also a lot of haze

108.94 --> 116.42
going around now I can't make out

113.75 --> 118.759
whether that that haze above the regular

116.42 --> 121.97
visible clouds is made by chemtrails or

118.759 --> 126.68
some other process because I can't

121.97 --> 129.709
really distinguish any specific type of

126.68 --> 132.44
line patterns that usually come from

129.709 --> 138.89000000000001
chem trail so that might be natural I

132.44 --> 140.66
don't know what anyway yet when the Sun

138.89 --> 145.54
comes through it's pretty nice and

140.66 --> 145.54
bright but it is very cold though

147.97 --> 160.46
anyway that's nice all right so I got

159.32 --> 165.54999999999998
tea with me

160.46 --> 168.05
I had to Mara coffee but I finished it I

165.55 --> 177.17000000000002
don't drink Tamera coffee on the show

168.05 --> 181.04000000000002
anymore so let's see who's in chat all

177.17 --> 190.51999999999998
right a gem was first Julia Pavan hmm

181.04 --> 202.34
mother Salim Obama Co dumb tricks done

190.52 --> 210.98000000000002
what am i UK clash on it and Oakley 9

202.34 --> 219.68
Yeti all right Ian Adams who has a Black

210.98 --> 223.37
Swan icon now typical am i UK dank good

219.68 --> 229.69
to see you man good servant also good to

223.37 --> 237.5
see you flatter spaceman bait 60 our MC

229.69 --> 240.73
Serato sarita Cosentino Tomoko tiny

237.5 --> 240.73
Womble Walter

243.34 --> 254.05
Adam ikan good see you pumpkin

248.32 --> 264.11
yeah nice nice turn up

254.05 --> 264.77000000000004
so yesterday I think I spent most of my

264.11 --> 267.56
time

264.77 --> 276.32
literally listening and being fascinated

267.56 --> 280.91
over music man yeah so that distracted

276.32 --> 284.0
me greatly but other than that there was

280.91 --> 292.22
Owen Benjamin again very interesting

284.0 --> 295.49
stuff what else was there yeah of course

292.22 --> 298.1
the Flat Earth debates though I was a

295.49 --> 300.53000000000003
wave for a lot of the time and seems

298.1 --> 310.22
that when I was away there was a pretty

300.53 --> 313.17999999999995
good conversation going on yeah did I go

310.22 --> 313.18
over to Jose's

314.61 --> 335.159
I'm not sure right oh yeah more QE

325.759 --> 338.909
related activity going on somebody made

335.159 --> 344.87
a like a silly video of that time that

338.909 --> 350.669
QE declared war on Jaron and Karen B and

344.87 --> 353.4
and all those people put like a movie

350.669 --> 356.60999999999996
for a reenactment from what is it world

353.4 --> 358.53
war 2 or world I think World War 1 over

356.61 --> 363.33000000000004
there with the typical war drum music

358.53 --> 366.44
and it was just silly I don't even know

363.33 --> 369.06
if it was purely meant as a joke or as

366.44 --> 373.759
detrimental trolling I just couldn't

369.06 --> 373.759
make out it was silly and kind of funny

376.37 --> 383.639
no mother Salim I did not forget that I

379.529 --> 385.879
actually did do that I think you missed

383.639 --> 385.879
it

389.01 --> 392.139
[Music]

396.51 --> 399.709
[Music]

408.1 --> 412.33000000000004
really in atoms you had the Black Swan

410.44 --> 419.44
for weeks huh well this is the first

412.33 --> 423.59999999999997
time I'm noticing then hmm yes sleeping

419.44 --> 423.6
worried that's right he does

436.34 --> 439.09
hmm

444.12 --> 446.81
right

447.13 --> 456.57
yeah that's that's kind of weird isn't

449.35 --> 462.79
it Yui yeah the thing is I have such a

456.57 --> 466.39
you say kind of I don't know I did this

462.79 --> 468.28000000000003
I have like dark world foreknowledge of

466.39 --> 471.84
this whole virus situation and I

468.28 --> 474.15999999999997
remember my attitude from it then and I

471.84 --> 476.91999999999996
it's one of the few things that I

474.16 --> 479.53000000000003
actually do remember pretty well and

476.92 --> 482.8
that is that it's just [ __ ] it's

479.53 --> 485.2
mind control from the government and it

482.8 --> 488.62
could potentially be dangerous to have

485.2 --> 491.34999999999997
this kind of approach openly as I do so

488.62 --> 496.3
I'm not trying to push it too much on

491.35 --> 504.70000000000005
everyone but I am very certain that it's

496.3 --> 507.94
not what they say it is and I don't know

504.7 --> 511.39
I guess that for those that do look into

507.94 --> 515.83
it more deeply than I have in a literal

511.39 --> 517.66
sense watching all the statistics and

515.83 --> 520.21
all the graphs and all the supposed

517.66 --> 522.49
videos because I don't really look

520.21 --> 524.76
around that much and I just I don't want

522.49 --> 527.53
to be exposed to the frequencies of it

524.76 --> 530.59
but then you probably already start to

527.53 --> 534.79
figure out that like this story doesn't

530.59 --> 537.5400000000001
add up with the statistics and if you

534.79 --> 542.41
actually know what those statistics are

537.54 --> 546.4599999999999
it's it it'll probably give more and

542.41 --> 549.87
more people the feel of like what is it

546.46 --> 554.0500000000001
polls for like presidential race

549.87 --> 556.24
situations in politics like everybody

554.05 --> 558.8199999999999
knows like you've got to be like a

556.24 --> 561.34
complete oblivious idiot not to know

558.82 --> 564.1600000000001
that's just severely manipulated and all

561.34 --> 566.23
kinds of way and not exactly what they

564.16 --> 571.3
say it is and while this is gonna feel

566.23 --> 574.57
very much the same it's basically you

571.3 --> 579.6999999999999
could say kind of like a new flu season

574.57 --> 580.8100000000001
that they certainly enhance into being

579.7 --> 586.1400000000001
more than it is

580.81 --> 590.4599999999999
with this mystical virus situation and

586.14 --> 598.27
yeah that's how I'm regarding it really

590.46 --> 602.0500000000001
but yeah I'm not personally saying it's

598.27 --> 610.66
bad not to look into the details even

602.05 --> 612.79
though I'm trying not to sleep in

610.66 --> 615.79
warrior a sleeping warrior you wanna

612.79 --> 617.56
come on with me on the panel maybe Adam

615.79 --> 625.87
Ian wants to join as well it would be

617.56 --> 629.17
good to have a talk like a talk outside

625.87 --> 632.05
of the debate you know and in a way I

629.17 --> 637.4399999999999
kind of used ran tease for that but yeah

632.05 --> 637.4399999999999
rent is just turned up basic

658.01 --> 666.1899999999999
at work okay damn it

667.23 --> 686.07
you're in this storm okay okay all right

679.91 --> 687.9599999999999
so yeah in a way I kind of need to

686.07 --> 690.84
address like how things have changed you

687.96 --> 695.85
know I I'm getting kind of sick of that

690.84 --> 698.85
I always do this you know it makes me

695.85 --> 701.61
feel very pokey like I'm poking in

698.85 --> 703.41
people's business or something and I

701.61 --> 706.92
don't necessarily want to do that even

703.41 --> 708.78
though like I guess from a universal

706.92 --> 710.9399999999999
perspective even though I kind of ask

708.78 --> 714.18
people to do that with me if they're not

710.94 --> 717.0
trolls if they actually have goodwill

714.18 --> 720.54
towards me but that is really my thing

717.0 --> 723.18
it's not the norm I'm not expecting that

720.54 --> 725.37
to be the norm so I do feel like I'm

723.18 --> 727.43
very pokey but anyway look the whole

725.37 --> 731.43
situation with Randy now and his

727.43 --> 733.38
coronavirus embrace I don't really care

731.43 --> 736.9499999999999
at this point whether he really believed

733.38 --> 739.5
it or not he's went for that and I don't

736.95 --> 748.95
have any personal issues with him

739.5 --> 751.92
because well he hasn't really like bro

748.95 --> 754.5600000000001
yeah he hasn't violated any personal

751.92 --> 758.6999999999999
code towards me it's just his choice he

754.56 --> 759.89
wants to do this whatever fuels him to

758.7 --> 762.69
do it

759.89 --> 762.9
that's up to him you know he is who he

762.69 --> 764.97
is

762.9 --> 766.8
so it's nothing personal that I'm not

764.97 --> 771.0
like going there now it's just that I

766.8 --> 775.77
don't want to don't want to dip into the

771.0 --> 778.68
fear porn that's it so there's no

775.77 --> 782.3299999999999
infighting going on like it basically

778.68 --> 785.4599999999999
ranted sort of men at the situation and

782.33 --> 787.38
it's still fine even though he's now

785.46 --> 790.5500000000001
doing that and I'm kind of doing my own

787.38 --> 790.55
thing here

791.59 --> 794.4300000000001
all right

796.05 --> 800.4799999999999
[Music]

811.08 --> 814.249
[Music]

818.91 --> 825.6
yeah red-eye no written data Meakin look

822.93 --> 829.38
he's still very careful in his approach

825.6 --> 837.02
and it can kind of appreciate it it's

829.38 --> 837.02
just that he is embracing that it yeah

839.99 --> 848.55
my personal strategy is to literally let

845.04 --> 852.48
the spell fizzle and not to go into it

848.55 --> 856.0999999999999
dispelling every piece of it because the

852.48 --> 859.5600000000001
foundation you know it is almost like a

856.1 --> 861.48
flat earth debate situation it's like

859.56 --> 864.51
yeah if you're gonna go with the baller

861.48 --> 866.28
story about how satellites are orbiting

864.51 --> 868.53
and then how does certain little

866.28 --> 870.48
mechanic work or whatever or how does

868.53 --> 873.06
that work on a flat earth then you're

870.48 --> 875.04
already presupposing so much and to me

873.06 --> 881.31
this all feels like the same I really

875.04 --> 884.0699999999999
feel that the the virus mechanic the

881.31 --> 889.8599999999999
system of how they said it works is just

884.07 --> 891.63
not like that and it has involvement but

889.86 --> 894.39
it's just not like that

891.63 --> 901.41
and the scenario like the worst-case

894.39 --> 906.05
scenario type of situations are not what

901.41 --> 909.78
they appear to be when they suggest that

906.05 --> 913.8599999999999
it's like there are more factors at play

909.78 --> 917.04
that way much more than just the general

913.86 --> 920.03
situation and and they don't emphasize

917.04 --> 924.3
that that's why I said it's all about

920.03 --> 928.91
moral about demoralization that is kind

924.3 --> 932.52
of the key to the whole thing

928.91 --> 935.64
and maybe even to the very presence of

932.52 --> 938.49
viruses and their activity as part of

935.64 --> 942.59
the biome which is currently my angle to

938.49 --> 942.59
the approach of it so

984.1 --> 992.96
right refraction refraction and

990.35 --> 999.23
diffraction and to rest your refraction

992.96 --> 1003.85
in the cognitive dissonance and that's

999.23 --> 1007.53
going to go that's going to continue to

1003.85 --> 1007.53
perpetuate itself for a while

1026.48 --> 1038.0
a cognitive refraction it's like if the

1033.679 --> 1040.5790000000002
cognitive medium is too dense then there

1038.0 --> 1045.679
will be a deviation of the pathway of

1040.579 --> 1046.6299999999999
the light beaming like that I like that

1045.679 --> 1050.65
a lot

1046.63 --> 1054.679
cognitive refraction that is awesome

1050.65 --> 1069.5900000000001
yeah maybe I'm just being really geeky

1054.679 --> 1072.98
right now get it the medium of the mind

1069.59 --> 1076.9099999999999
is too dense for the light sprinkling

1072.98 --> 1081.83
ideas then there will be a a deviation

1076.91 --> 1084.52
pathway and a distortion brilliant I

1081.83 --> 1084.52
like this

1090.24 --> 1092.27
Oh

1094.38 --> 1099.93
Cerreta cousin studied because they know

1096.81 --> 1103.59
not just extreme refraction Oh infinite

1099.93 --> 1106.94
refraction and more than the infinite

1103.59 --> 1106.9399999999998
refraction remember that

1124.99 --> 1132.19
yeah there was the super mega looming

1129.63 --> 1135.5800000000002
which is complete misunderstanding of

1132.19 --> 1138.5700000000002
looming because it suggests that horizon

1135.58 --> 1140.9499999999998
is actually looming above and horizon

1138.57 --> 1144.279
but yeah that's where the super mega

1140.95 --> 1146.6200000000001
looming came in thanks to rumpus and if

1144.279 --> 1151.12
I remember correctly it was rule Hef who

1146.62 --> 1153.82
brought in the infinite refraction and

1151.12 --> 1159.1899999999998
more than infinite refraction in his

1153.82 --> 1162.279
attempt to explain it but it was mostly

1159.19 --> 1163.96
just a mathematical extrapolated

1162.279 --> 1166.74
explanation doesn't make any sense

1163.96 --> 1166.74
beyond maths

1189.01 --> 1195.34
made sixty RMC you don't know where they

1191.62 --> 1198.79
come from I'm pretty certain there is

1195.34 --> 1202.8
probably biotech labs roughly everywhere

1198.79 --> 1205.8999999999999
in the world and whatever they're doing

1202.8 --> 1207.79
it all depends on whatever is some kind

1205.9 --> 1211.1200000000001
of plan is or whatever they want to let

1207.79 --> 1214.27
it out break because it never happens by

1211.12 --> 1217.4199999999998
accident that's like high-security vile

1214.27 --> 1221.37
labs just they can't it's impossible for

1217.42 --> 1224.8300000000002
that to happen well unless the entire

1221.37 --> 1228.28
nature of what they're even dealing with

1224.83 --> 1231.1599999999999
is completely misunderstood in which

1228.28 --> 1233.19
case the entire security apparatus is

1231.16 --> 1237.6100000000001
not really gonna matter that much anyway

1233.19 --> 1240.3
but yeah to say oh it's always coming

1237.61 --> 1244.2099999999998
from here or there no not really

1240.3 --> 1247.33
you know elapsed fool around with all

1244.21 --> 1251.8
kinds of microbial biology collisions

1247.33 --> 1259.87
and bacteria and to fool around with

1251.8 --> 1263.8
viruses but yeah where the hearts are of

1259.87 --> 1266.82
when like a disease or a situation like

1263.8 --> 1269.8
that breaks out it always happens in

1266.82 --> 1273.28
yeah in places where there's a lot of

1269.8 --> 1276.22
people in combination with not to create

1273.28 --> 1278.62
health maintenance in combination with

1276.22 --> 1282.64
demoralization that everybody's

1278.62 --> 1287.3799999999999
relatively demoralized yeah that anxiety

1282.64 --> 1290.0800000000002
is like standardized and that really

1287.38 --> 1292.93
causes the situations that diseases

1290.08 --> 1295.72
break out like that that everybody like

1292.93 --> 1297.4
really gets sick and I think that the

1295.72 --> 1301.33
combination of those factors matter

1297.4 --> 1303.5800000000002
technically more than whatever the

1301.33 --> 1307.3
supposed organism is whether it is an

1303.58 --> 1310.06
organism like a for-real or not I think

1307.3 --> 1315.12
those factors matter a lot more for how

1310.06 --> 1315.12
severe such situations become

1315.66 --> 1323.46
and that's why we I guess typically see

1319.82 --> 1327.2
outbreaks in certain type of regions pop

1323.46 --> 1330.06
up and then from there I'm spread out

1327.2 --> 1333.3600000000001
you know that's probably pretty relative

1330.06 --> 1334.71
it's not as literal or not as lasting

1333.36 --> 1336.7099999999998
because I think that most of these

1334.71 --> 1339.27
things if they are even

1336.71 --> 1342.03
self-perpetuating they just mutate into

1339.27 --> 1345.48
something that is less dangerous I think

1342.03 --> 1346.19
that is the default situation with all

1345.48 --> 1349.47
of it

1346.19 --> 1352.2
so the spreading out is conceptual it's

1349.47 --> 1354.1100000000001
it doesn't like literally spread out

1352.2 --> 1357.03
everywhere like before it reaches

1354.11 --> 1360.06
certain point it's gonna mutate into

1357.03 --> 1362.1499999999999
something how are harmless that's what I

1360.06 --> 1365.01
think how it really works in actuality

1362.15 --> 1367.68
that's kind of what finger work at this

1365.01 --> 1369.87
point yeah it's a giant super data and

1367.68 --> 1373.41
interpretations and angles I think that

1369.87 --> 1376.9499999999998
is kind of what is really there yeah

1373.41 --> 1380.43
stuff it can spread it woke like

1376.95 --> 1383.19
resonate this the sickness situation but

1380.43 --> 1385.89
it can technically jump but the more it

1383.19 --> 1388.56
jumps the more it basically undergoes

1385.89 --> 1390.8400000000001
the metabolic effects of the individual

1388.56 --> 1394.59
that is incubating it the more it

1390.84 --> 1397.1999999999998
changes until simply the original

1394.59 --> 1401.31
weaponized aspects that it was bred for

1397.2 --> 1403.1100000000001
simply are gone and it's kind of funny

1401.31 --> 1408.4199999999998
because you could almost compare it to

1403.11 --> 1411.0
the societal integration it's like what

1408.42 --> 1413.25
happens to extremely warrior like people

1411.0 --> 1415.62
when over three generations they are

1413.25 --> 1418.2
severely gentrified with all kinds of

1415.62 --> 1420.4499999999998
things mind control food yeah they all

1418.2 --> 1423.48
lose well they still have traces of

1420.45 --> 1425.79
their of their warrior nature but it's

1423.48 --> 1431.07
also suppressed it's all gone out of

1425.79 --> 1434.6299999999999
reach and I think you could compare that

1431.07 --> 1439.77
to just the general situation with

1434.63 --> 1442.14
bacteria and viruses or at least with

1439.77 --> 1444.56
viruses if you can even consider them as

1442.14 --> 1444.5600000000002
organisms

1449.639 --> 1454.86
so yeah that those are my thoughts about

1452.71 --> 1454.8600000000001
it

1480.19 --> 1487.69
right master Selenia good point well it

1484.45 --> 1490.24
is it's big the whole Nathan Oakley show

1487.69 --> 1493.1200000000001
flattered debates you have flattered

1490.24 --> 1498.97
this kind of deal it's like the main

1493.12 --> 1501.6699999999998
weapon it's the situation that where it

1498.97 --> 1505.03
comes down to really but overall the

1501.67 --> 1512.14
general principles that are being upheld

1505.03 --> 1516.94
is very rudimentary Academical academics

1512.14 --> 1520.72
and yeah basically what can you prove

1516.94 --> 1522.88
and be correct about what it is you're

1520.72 --> 1526.1200000000001
saying are you presupposing something

1522.88 --> 1530.44
are you literally claiming it or is it

1526.12 --> 1532.1499999999999
just a idea and it is one of the things

1530.44 --> 1533.89
that I've personally taken in my

1532.15 --> 1536.71
personal development and the way I

1533.89 --> 1539.1100000000001
explain things from the debates they

1536.71 --> 1541.39
trained it and I really like it that

1539.11 --> 1545.1399999999999
they did that it reminds me of how my

1541.39 --> 1547.66
parents trained me in in talking when I

1545.14 --> 1550.0900000000001
was a teenager and even a preteen they

1547.66 --> 1553.1200000000001
were very on top of that always checking

1550.09 --> 1555.8799999999999
me always correcting me and making me do

1553.12 --> 1558.1599999999999
things and because of the debates and

1555.88 --> 1560.65
because I've been there it kind of

1558.16 --> 1564.3400000000001
forced me to start to be extremely

1560.65 --> 1566.71
correct about what I'm saying so there

1564.34 --> 1575.35
can't be any mistakes about it and that

1566.71 --> 1577.38
I thereby gain much more freedom because

1575.35 --> 1580.35
I don't over generalize what I

1577.38 --> 1583.45
conceptualize as a potential possibility

1580.35 --> 1586.24
with what I presume apps to be

1583.45 --> 1588.3700000000001
absolutely there and it's a something

1586.24 --> 1591.34
that a lot of people that try to figure

1588.37 --> 1593.9499999999998
things out kind of mix up it's difficult

1591.34 --> 1598.27
to keep it apart also because we have

1593.95 --> 1601.3300000000002
been what is it the sense that we've

1598.27 --> 1603.54
been the training to keep them apart has

1601.33 --> 1607.62
been systematically undermined

1603.54 --> 1609.94
culturally also thanks to the scientism

1607.62 --> 1611.8899999999999
thanks to the pseudoscience community

1609.94 --> 1614.1000000000001
and the ballers that has on purpose

1611.89 --> 1617.5200000000002
undermined the distinguishment

1614.1 --> 1620.34
system to keep you in to enhance the

1617.52 --> 1623.97
cognitive dissonance system to make that

1620.34 --> 1628.98
last longer on average so I am

1623.97 --> 1631.44
personally resurrecting that discipline

1628.98 --> 1633.57
for myself and it falls under academics

1631.44 --> 1637.0800000000002
and it's extremely important for what I

1633.57 --> 1639.9189999999999
do so I'm just very happy that I've had

1637.08 --> 1639.9189999999999
that opportunity

1648.809 --> 1654.73
yeah and I'm kind of sad about everyone

1651.88 --> 1656.5
out there that have that claim all these

1654.73 --> 1659.65
things have all these titles have all

1656.5 --> 1662.29
these pieces of paper that aren't doing

1659.65 --> 1667.3600000000001
it even though they're supposed to be

1662.29 --> 1670.72
I don't know societally my superior they

1667.36 --> 1671.9399999999998
have more papers than me why aren't they

1670.72 --> 1682.78
doing it right

1671.94 --> 1685.45
it's kind of frustrating to see that but

1682.78 --> 1690.8999999999999
again as I said it's very hard to let go

1685.45 --> 1693.19
of that oh yeah of the freedom to

1690.9 --> 1697.72
literally believe things that you are

1693.19 --> 1701.26
imagining to be real it is the the globe

1697.72 --> 1703.33
self building religion and it is the

1701.26 --> 1705.97
most appealing aspect so it is what I

1703.33 --> 1710.02
found the most fascinating about it it's

1705.97 --> 1713.23
like we are trying to figure out reality

1710.02 --> 1715.6299999999999
and we just build as we go and the

1713.23 --> 1720.45
better it works the more real it is and

1715.63 --> 1724.17
we then trust upon the reality of it but

1720.45 --> 1726.3700000000001
by that approach that kind of it

1724.17 --> 1731.3700000000001
engineering trial and error based

1726.37 --> 1734.11
approach of building a model for reality

1731.37 --> 1735.9699999999998
everyone that starts doing that they

1734.11 --> 1738.01
always start from a certain specific

1735.97 --> 1740.44
foundation that is given a direction

1738.01 --> 1743.02
through the patron the preponderance of

1740.44 --> 1745.0
knowledge that I've learned from the

1743.02 --> 1747.37
school books everything so it's gonna be

1745.0 --> 1750.52
nudged in a specific way that'll

1747.37 --> 1754.75
automatically force them to overlook a

1750.52 --> 1757.54
lot of things in their approach so they

1754.75 --> 1760.03
will usually eventually end up kind of

1757.54 --> 1761.559
in the same corner with the same kind of

1760.03 --> 1763.42
story the same kind of conditions

1761.559 --> 1769.3
because of the material they've built

1763.42 --> 1773.92
themselves up with and it is built to

1769.3 --> 1776.4099999999999
allow you to keep on building the dream

1773.92 --> 1778.3600000000001
to fool yourself with that is

1776.41 --> 1780.38
mechanically what is happening and it is

1778.36 --> 1782.8999999999999
pretty freakin amazing

1780.38 --> 1786.2900000000002
that it kind of works that it's been

1782.9 --> 1788.8400000000001
working for so long and just what comes

1786.29 --> 1793.7
out of it is pretty astonishing it's

1788.84 --> 1795.74
like a dream made real that is what it

1793.7 --> 1800.06
is to these people that's what it was to

1795.74 --> 1803.0
me it's a dream you make real and people

1800.06 --> 1805.07
accept it a lot of them and that's

1803.0 --> 1808.48
incredible it is an incredible

1805.07 --> 1814.85
experience but it is basically a

1808.48 --> 1817.85
religious experience and it's not some

1814.85 --> 1820.85
kind of I gotcha it's not come a joke it

1817.85 --> 1824.24
really is it is a religious experience

1820.85 --> 1828.4699999999998
and able to build reality from the

1824.24 --> 1830.6
dreams you get it's amazing and that

1828.47 --> 1833.42
it's kind of accepted it's an amazing

1830.6 --> 1837.6499999999999
experience makes it's very gratifying

1833.42 --> 1839.42
and elevating as it can also and yeah

1837.65 --> 1843.2
create a lot of mania if you're not

1839.42 --> 1847.1000000000001
careful with that megalomania but anyway

1843.2 --> 1850.45
it is a religious experience because it

1847.1 --> 1856.1
yeah it's a mechanism that kind of works

1850.45 --> 1859.25
but it excludes so much and it does not

1856.1 --> 1862.1
allow you to be revealed that what

1859.25 --> 1863.98
you're building is purely conceptual and

1862.1 --> 1865.9399999999998
that there's already a lot of

1863.98 --> 1870.17
presuppositions that have not been

1865.94 --> 1872.39
proven that have sneaked in with the

1870.17 --> 1875.8400000000001
current playground that most people will

1872.39 --> 1878.66
be at it will be building the blocks on

1875.84 --> 1880.3999999999999
top of the tower as it were in the whole

1878.66 --> 1883.1000000000001
preponderance of it all they're like

1880.4 --> 1885.14
trying to get to that heavenly they're

1883.1 --> 1887.09
trying to get to the heaven they're

1885.14 --> 1888.98
building high high not realizing that

1887.09 --> 1892.6699999999998
what they're building on at the

1888.98 --> 1894.74
foundation much more down it's not

1892.67 --> 1897.6100000000001
really stable there are things that are

1894.74 --> 1900.44
just blatantly wrong and unproven and

1897.61 --> 1902.8999999999999
another direction would have to be taken

1900.44 --> 1906.5
in order to keep it real and it hasn't

1902.9 --> 1908.69
so it being building air castles

1906.5 --> 1910.22
literally that's what most people

1908.69 --> 1913.01
therefore end up doing

1910.22 --> 1915.23
because they left the presuppositions be

1913.01 --> 1917.36
their foundations and overlook them and

1915.23 --> 1918.95
therefore whatever they're going to and

1917.36 --> 1921.77
visualize it whatever they're gonna

1918.95 --> 1925.419
construct in their mind it's never gonna

1921.77 --> 1929.6299999999999
lead to anything the only thing it's it

1925.419 --> 1931.8200000000002
maintains itself is because of the love

1929.63 --> 1933.47
of the game it's just like why do you

1931.82 --> 1936.35
keep playing a certain computer game

1933.47 --> 1939.59
well because it's very satisfying and it

1936.35 --> 1942.4399999999998
kind of appeals it calls you like you

1939.59 --> 1944.299
want to go there and you already know if

1942.44 --> 1946.28
you've played in plenty of games that in

1944.299 --> 1949.25
the end when you basically finish it all

1946.28 --> 1951.049
the fun is stripped away it's done you

1949.25 --> 1953.57
like you've seen it now you know it and

1951.049 --> 1954.28
it's done it's no not the same fun

1953.57 --> 1957.2
anymore

1954.28 --> 1959.8999999999999
well with building air castles that

1957.2 --> 1963.289
never ends until you finally realize

1959.9 --> 1965.21
that you built on faulty foundations and

1963.289 --> 1968.929
as soon as you realize it all crashes

1965.21 --> 1971.679
down and most people spend a lifetime a

1968.929 --> 1975.14
lot of these ballers spend a lifetime

1971.679 --> 1980.99
preventing the castle they built from

1975.14 --> 1982.5490000000002
crashing down and it's a complete waste

1980.99 --> 1983.57
of everyone's time the only thing

1982.549 --> 1985.94
they're really doing is keeping

1983.57 --> 1989.02
themselves in their dream that's what

1985.94 --> 1989.02
they're effectively doing

1992.86 --> 2000.079
[Music]

2011.61 --> 2015.26
anybody is listening

2025.83 --> 2030.74
I know sometimes from the Chad I just

2035.16 --> 2041.0500000000002
okay okay

2038.31 --> 2045.58
yeah I guess that the people that will

2041.05 --> 2049.63
be listening are probably just gonna let

2045.58 --> 2052.9
me yeah I'll just listen yes I do kind

2049.63 --> 2055.51
of let sometimes bring out ideas that

2052.9 --> 2057.7000000000003
really then start to get a life of its

2055.51 --> 2059.5
own in people's mind so therefore they

2057.7 --> 2061.6899999999996
grow silent while other people not

2059.5 --> 2063.85
delving into the subject just chatter on

2061.69 --> 2065.4700000000003
about other things and then that kind of

2063.85 --> 2067.99
gives me the feeling like nobody's

2065.47 --> 2070.8399999999997
listening you know what I mean it's kind

2067.99 --> 2078.6099999999997
of weird how that works but I'm glad

2070.84 --> 2089.52
that that you are listening all

2078.61 --> 2089.52
subconsciously probably all right

2106.51 --> 2111.94
right oh by the way

2108.41 --> 2116.0
yeah something unusual I also watched

2111.94 --> 2119.86
quantum of conscious video the one he

2116.0 --> 2124.55
did yesterday it's a super conceptual

2119.86 --> 2127.9700000000003
from a very cold cold view as it were

2124.55 --> 2130.46
was so-called it's it's an it's a

2127.97 --> 2134.75
classical atheist mechanism one of the

2130.46 --> 2138.77
things that kind of got to me a lot when

2134.75 --> 2140.96
I was young to get clear about knowns

2138.77 --> 2143.48
and unknowns in a way it almost played

2140.96 --> 2145.4
into some that some of the things that

2143.48 --> 2148.94
I've been talking about last two three

2145.4 --> 2157.85
days and he put it down really well but

2148.94 --> 2162.46
then he proceeded to insert well it

2157.85 --> 2162.46
pretty much ain't nothing perspective

2164.2 --> 2169.75
and that kind of seemed disappointing

2166.54 --> 2171.75
like he seemed to say like yeah but

2169.75 --> 2179.02
there is no purpose

2171.75 --> 2184.57
it just happens and I don't know I'd say

2179.02 --> 2187.599
I get what he means but it's wrong it's

2184.57 --> 2190.9
just it's only correct from a very

2187.599 --> 2193.329
specific perspective because what it

2190.9 --> 2195.73
does overlook is that our very conscious

2193.329 --> 2200.7000000000003
are indeed an integral part of the whole

2195.73 --> 2204.849
thing we're literally in my opinion a

2200.7 --> 2210.64
sub part of the created the Creator

2204.849 --> 2217.0
consciousness itself that enters us and

2210.64 --> 2220.81
experiences the creation because there

2217.0 --> 2223.75
is a creator something that mechanically

2220.81 --> 2226.359
cannot be undone it has to be there

2223.75 --> 2228.94
intelligent design so then there must be

2226.359 --> 2232.06
purpose if there is information then

2228.94 --> 2239.52
there is purpose because that's the only

2232.06 --> 2245.5
reason information exists in my vagin

2239.52 --> 2249.16
so yeah whatever we are during our life

2245.5 --> 2252.22
that the preponderance of our presence

2249.16 --> 2256.3289999999997
our experience our changes our

2252.22 --> 2259.4399999999996
influences our legacies and maybe even

2256.329 --> 2262.329
our spirits after death that can be

2259.44 --> 2265.599
contacted or have still influences after

2262.329 --> 2269.76
death for all of that that is kind of

2265.599 --> 2274.48
separate to that we are literally a

2269.76 --> 2280.3900000000003
strand of the entire weave of creation

2274.48 --> 2284.2
that we are a part like even a fragment

2280.39 --> 2286.93
of our consciousness is like a puzzle to

2284.2 --> 2291.91
the whole timeless piece in its own way

2286.93 --> 2295.06
and I think that this is personal a

2291.91 --> 2297.339
personal also vision-related conviction

2295.06 --> 2300.759
is that once you really die

2297.339 --> 2304.0589999999997
then you just you're with God and you

2300.759 --> 2306.969
get to see the whole thing and you get

2304.059 --> 2310.869
to see your part and your significance

2306.969 --> 2313.39
and your in significance and and you

2310.869 --> 2317.17
basically dissolve in the in the grand

2313.39 --> 2318.359
light of it all something in that

2317.17 --> 2322.39
direction

2318.359 --> 2326.859
it's like yeah once all of that light

2322.39 --> 2329.2
all envelops you the the primitive

2326.859 --> 2333.13
conscious the consciousness of growth

2329.2 --> 2336.839
once you touch the true perfection of

2333.13 --> 2341.529
the source of what you are manifestly

2336.839 --> 2345.0389999999998
then it's accomplished its fulfilled its

2341.529 --> 2350.17
the game is played you've seen it

2345.039 --> 2352.92
there's no more reason for it see it's

2350.17 --> 2352.92
complicated

2356.61 --> 2359.699
[Music]

2360.49 --> 2367.83
why are you saying that Sarita Cosentino

2364.08 --> 2367.83
what am I making up

2376.31 --> 2383.06
I'll read the Bible oh because that is

2379.91 --> 2386.6
the only way to interpret it so what I

2383.06 --> 2389.96
just said does not fit into the actual

2386.6 --> 2396.16
process you think that what I said is

2389.96 --> 2403.15
blasphemous do you you think that's

2396.16 --> 2403.1499999999996
wrong no you just what do you do then

2404.2 --> 2412.43
seem to be so so very very clear as to

2409.94 --> 2422.93
exactly what happens after death sorry

2412.43 --> 2425.54
the cousin Tina well I'm glad you have

2422.93 --> 2430.6099999999997
your mind made up exactly as to what

2425.54 --> 2432.7599999999998
happens this is seems kind of silly to

2430.61 --> 2432.76
me

2443.14 --> 2450.72
no I think you need to stop addressing

2446.019 --> 2457.93
me like this and either correct me or

2450.72 --> 2460.45
shut up so if you know exactly what

2457.93 --> 2465.749
happened said eita why did you write it

2460.45 --> 2465.749
down why did you write it down okay

2465.96 --> 2471.46
that's last warning if you're gonna

2468.749 --> 2475.18
smart-mouth me again or tell me to read

2471.46 --> 2477.579
it for your claim how I was wrong

2475.18 --> 2481.45
without actually putting down the

2477.579 --> 2485.4700000000003
arguments as to what then I'm gonna ban

2481.45 --> 2492.3689999999997
you now permanently I'm just telling you

2485.47 --> 2495.8799999999997
I'm just telling you don't act like this

2492.369 --> 2497.65
in my hangout if you're gonna say I'm

2495.88 --> 2502.119
wrong then you're gonna put down the

2497.65 --> 2509.829
arguments doesn't matter what it's about

2502.119 --> 2513.96
now now don't tell me I need to do

2509.829 --> 2513.96
anything you're gonna write it down

2547.029 --> 2550.109
I'll see you later

2553.4 --> 2558.5
I guess you don't know your place in

2555.62 --> 2560.18
this hangout if you're gonna tell me I'm

2558.5 --> 2561.92
wrong about something that I've

2560.18 --> 2563.02
elaborately talked about very

2561.92 --> 2565.4300000000003
openheartedly

2563.02 --> 2569.06
tell me I wrong and then proceeded to

2565.43 --> 2573.2
tell me what I need to do and not

2569.06 --> 2576.47
actually put up the data that supports

2573.2 --> 2579.3799999999997
the claim that you're making then you're

2576.47 --> 2581.72
bent I don't give a [ __ ] who you are if

2579.38 --> 2584.06
you're Christian if you're a flat

2581.72 --> 2587.2999999999997
earther whatever you are if you're gonna

2584.06 --> 2589.67
do that in my hangout like that you're

2587.3 --> 2593.92
gonna get the same treatment as ballers

2589.67 --> 2593.92
that do that just so you know

2606.87 --> 2610.0
[Music]

2616.91 --> 2627.0499999999997
right don't quick stun man that name is

2622.16 --> 2629.72
quite a tone breaker but he gets it he's

2627.05 --> 2631.94
not even making Sarita Cosentino's

2629.72 --> 2634.16
argument he gets what I'm saying it's

2631.94 --> 2639.79
all about the angle it's all about the

2634.16 --> 2639.79
approach it's just this

2651.589 --> 2658.7889999999998
yeah well hey during great others tell

2655.219 --> 2660.4990000000003
you just read the freaking Wikipedia the

2658.789 --> 2664.88
science book that's all the proof they

2660.499 --> 2669.049
need I don't care if you are the one

2664.88 --> 2669.829
that says no you're wrong Arwen you're

2669.049 --> 2673.189
wrong

2669.829 --> 2677.9
then you better well put down the actual

2673.189 --> 2684.459
thing to prove it and not tell me to go

2677.9 --> 2684.4590000000003
out and do something it's unacceptable

2688.34 --> 2691.4590000000003
[Music]

2693.46 --> 2701.309
and besides if I do that I probably end

2698.26 --> 2705.28
up exactly where I left off and that is

2701.309 --> 2708.28
exactly what I said because you know in

2705.28 --> 2711.3390000000004
direct sense I have read it I have heard

2708.28 --> 2713.4700000000003
of it I I feel I get it and I get the

2711.339 --> 2716.5299999999997
multiple angles to it and I see the

2713.47 --> 2720.0299999999997
traps for everyone to fall into to

2716.53 --> 2723.28
narrow themselves down to a specific

2720.03 --> 2725.079
interpretation and not step outside in

2723.28 --> 2727.63
any way because they can't handle it

2725.079 --> 2732.42
because it's all too dangerous to them I

2727.63 --> 2732.42
don't have the senses to look beyond

2734.339 --> 2739.77
within the very Bible mind you

2749.349 --> 2759.319
it's areata Cosentino is she really I

2754.72 --> 2761.41
guess with an a would say so it I don't

2759.319 --> 2761.41
know

2777.98 --> 2782.5
right now you are a guy thought so

2812.77 --> 2818.04
you are sir it husband knew what

2826.24 --> 2838.8999999999996
okay Sarita that's cool well if you're

2835.75 --> 2843.28
not trying to trigger me then make sure

2838.9 --> 2846.13
you don't by actually putting down if

2843.28 --> 2847.6600000000003
you're gonna yeah oppose me if you're

2846.13 --> 2853.4500000000003
gonna oppose me and you're gonna give

2847.66 --> 2857.3799999999997
some kind of source for it don't write

2853.45 --> 2860.0499999999997
your Neil okay sorry Tao is a guy so I'm

2857.38 --> 2862.4100000000003
gonna just call you sir Ito from now on

2860.05 --> 2869.6400000000003
as I kind of tended to do because Sarita

2862.41 --> 2872.64
that's a girl's name your wife's email

2869.64 --> 2872.64
great

2876.49 --> 2888.1189999999997
I doubt you did professor Phil Bell I

2885.16 --> 2888.1189999999997
doubt you did

[Music]

2899.85 --> 2907.65
but you don't have to link you can just

2903.01 --> 2912.2200000000003
write down you can copy/paste it right

2907.65 --> 2913.4100000000003

2912.22 --> 2915.9399999999996
it down

hey there's two hundred characters that

2915.94 --> 2919.17
fit in a single message

2930.49 --> 2934.95
play whose video are you talking about

2956.98 --> 2964.23
it's really that's hilarious

2970.17 --> 2976.529
that's fantastical literally he claims

2973.589 --> 2981.989
that he can put satellites in an in a

2976.529 --> 2984.619
fictional thing it's awesome must be a

3013.67 --> 3022.9
Tom Parker is unbanned pretty sure I'm

3019.369 --> 3022.9
not no way I'm not sure

3028.41 --> 3035.68
it's just that you guys you know a lot

3031.78 --> 3038.079
of you guys you get loud and when more

3035.68 --> 3040.2999999999997
of the people that I ban eventually

3038.079 --> 3044.6090000000004
doing that [ __ ] when i unban you you get

3040.3 --> 3044.6090000000004
together and you get loud again so

3046.77 --> 3055.69
sometimes I wonder if just I keep

3053.14 --> 3057.46
inventing everyone again just because

3055.69 --> 3059.619
they're sorry you guys are gonna get

3057.46 --> 3080.2200000000003
together and get all rowdy and loud

3059.619 --> 3083.7000000000003
again so I'm Tom Parker good I am now

3080.22 --> 3087.2799999999997
still keeping my eye on you though but I

3083.7 --> 3089.14
at least you seem to get it you get my

3087.28 --> 3095.8590000000004
point and what I'm trying to achieve

3089.14 --> 3099.3689999999997
here so alright more colored well thank

3095.859 --> 3101.7
you for the for the message I will think

3099.369 --> 3101.7000000000003
about it

3111.99 --> 3120.64
Tyler Mac no I don't I got 16 thumbs

3116.14 --> 3125.79
down 12 up I haven't had more thumbs up

3120.64 --> 3125.79
than down in a long time

3133.819 --> 3139.549
what did professor feel but my job in

3136.91 --> 3148.239
India is to put satellites into final

3139.549 --> 3151.069
orbit that's that's crazy man

3148.239 --> 3156.979
professor Phil Bell you need to do like

3151.069 --> 3159.199
a a full 24 hour stream of yourself

3156.979 --> 3161.93
doing that freaking job and just show

3159.199 --> 3164.509
maybe you like putting a camera in your

3161.93 --> 3166.69
pocket just running recording everything

3164.509 --> 3173.779
you do except for going to the toilet

3166.69 --> 3176.869
probably and just show exactly what it

3173.779 --> 3180.229
is you're doing and then we'll see how

3176.869 --> 3182.42
much of involvement you actually have

3180.229 --> 3185.5989999999997
with actually putting these supposed

3182.42 --> 3189.619
satellites in orbit or if it's just the

3185.599 --> 3191.809
story that your gun going under and you

3189.619 --> 3197.029
don't actually have any direct proof

3191.809 --> 3200.509
that it is what it is you know I'd be

3197.029 --> 3203.469
fascinated to see that and probably also

3200.509 --> 3207.44
get absolutely bored out of my mind but

3203.469 --> 3209.68
that's occupational hazard with these

3207.44 --> 3209.68
things

3233.33 --> 3238.33
but yeah look I don't know who this guy

3236.93 --> 3242.06
is

3238.33 --> 3247.48
maybe I professor Phil Bell how long has

3242.06 --> 3247.48
he even been around let me check it out

3249.76 --> 3262.94
okay see whoa okay he's been around

3256.49 --> 3266.75
forever 2013 so it must be mostly just a

3262.94 --> 3269.27
YouTube side account for chatting

3266.75 --> 3272.33
because he doesn't even have 500

3269.27 --> 3274.67
subscribers yeah

3272.33 --> 3280.87
probably mostly just talking with a lot

3274.67 --> 3280.87
of people everywhere I imagine but I

3282.58 --> 3291.04
don't know I don't know who you are

3285.44 --> 3291.04
really except for you being in my chat

3309.82 --> 3318.52
ok Dorian Gray when did that happen

3313.0 --> 3324.42
I don't follow that guy at all that guy

3318.52 --> 3326.95

3324.42 --> 3337.63

3337.63 --> 3342.3900000000003
professor Phil belle-isle I'm sure I'm

3340.03 --> 3344.8

3342.39 --> 3348.31
