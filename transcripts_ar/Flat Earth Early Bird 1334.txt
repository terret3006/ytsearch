100.86 --> 106.32
yeah he said also that he would maybe

104.159 --> 108.78
pop up in the chat sometime so that

106.32 --> 111.74
would be pretty cool anyway hello guys

108.78 --> 111.74
first in chat

112.32 --> 119.17999999999999
all right

114.14 --> 119.18
weather is completely turned around

119.28 --> 125.7
it's become really clouded and it even

122.159 --> 128.13
like stormed a little last night

125.7 --> 131.33
a couple of lightning strikes

128.13 --> 131.32999999999998
[Music]

136.04 --> 142.85999999999999
and yeah right now it's just like this

140.52 --> 146.34
it's really moist and it's still warm

142.86 --> 148.31900000000002
but it yeah and sometimes droplets come

146.34 --> 151.019
down

148.319 --> 152.879
so I guess it it does rain a little here

151.019 --> 155.28
and there

152.879 --> 158.66
but yeah it definitely cooled down and

155.28 --> 158.66
it's really Pleasant right now

161.519 --> 166.8
it's like oh finally when I went out for

165.06 --> 169.14000000000001
groceries and it came back I wasn't

166.8 --> 172.31900000000002
completely overheated and melting and

169.14 --> 175.26
all that so I kind of like it

172.319 --> 177.29999999999998
I mean those hot days they have their

175.26 --> 180.39999999999998
function

177.3 --> 182.34
but not too long in a row so

180.4 --> 184.64000000000001
[Music]

182.34 --> 184.64000000000001
yeah

185.28 --> 191.22
it is Monday the 15th of August 2022

197.819 --> 203.35999999999999
temperature

199.68 --> 203.36
26 degrees Celsius

204.239 --> 209.48000000000002
oh with 68 participation huh

210.959 --> 217.94
so there is some rain apparently here

212.94 --> 217.94
and there but not directly over here

225.18 --> 227.84
huh

230.099 --> 232.76
right

232.86 --> 236.65900000000002
so it's back to 1pm

237.54 --> 240.67999999999998
and no cooking

242.34 --> 246.019
I got a Gusto over here

248.34 --> 253.81900000000002
everything was just rolling

250.86 --> 253.81900000000002
smoothly

256.48 --> 259.85
[Music]

263.22 --> 269.41900000000004
let's see

265.86 --> 269.41900000000004
what did I do yesterday

270.0 --> 273.5
early bird show of course

274.5 --> 278.16
I

276.06 --> 281.4
think I completely missed out on any

278.16 --> 283.91900000000004
kind of premiere

281.4 --> 287.78
Nathan didn't play like a full

283.919 --> 287.78
show for some reason

288.96 --> 294.19899999999996
or if he did I completely missed out on

291.419 --> 294.19899999999996
it for some reason

295.979 --> 299.4
yeah I think I may have just completely

297.9 --> 302.23999999999995
missed it

299.4 --> 302.23999999999995
but uh

303.419 --> 309.38
yeah yesterday I went to

306.0 --> 309.38
a little Hangout

309.84 --> 314.29999999999995
this Pakistani flat earther

317.22 --> 322.68
and yeah I actually caught his live

319.74 --> 324.479
stream and I just thought like yeah I'm

322.68 --> 326.88
gonna go on there

324.479 --> 329.58
uh he basically invited me in this as

326.88 --> 331.86
soon as he saw I was in chat but that

329.58 --> 334.8
was fun

331.86 --> 339.139
and like quite exhilarating actually

334.8 --> 339.139
also just watching

339.6 --> 345.91900000000004
like him go back and forth with a baller

342.539 --> 345.919
a Pakistani baller

346.08 --> 351.71999999999997
like I really it was so funny because

349.08 --> 354.479
they use a lot of English words like

351.72 --> 357.08000000000004
when it comes to like

354.479 --> 360.65999999999997
globe

357.08 --> 363.68
and refraction and like the technical

360.66 --> 366.84000000000003
words you see they do in English a lot

363.68 --> 368.52
and that's so funny because then you

366.84 --> 370.85999999999996
could just follow the conversation even

368.52 --> 374.479
though it's in Hindi like check it out

370.86 --> 374.47900000000004
like here's the

374.759 --> 377.52000000000004
the link

375.74 --> 379.919
[Music]

377.52 --> 382.919
but you gotta check that out like after

379.919 --> 386.28
my show or something somewhere

382.919 --> 387.96
I'm on it but yeah I got a big piece

386.28 --> 390.9
where I was just technically explaining

387.96 --> 393.23999999999995
about choreo this effect was a very pure

390.9 --> 395.09999999999997
Flat Earth show

393.24 --> 397.259
very enthusiastic

395.1 --> 399.53900000000004
and

397.259 --> 402.24
it was so funny with the Ballers on

399.539 --> 405.419
there because you could just hear

402.24 --> 408.539
them using the same tactics

405.419 --> 411.0
how did I notice that The Way They

408.539 --> 413.4
Carried themselves and they spoke

411.0 --> 416.759
and how the other guy responded like

413.4 --> 418.85999999999996
it's just flat earthers and ballers

416.759 --> 421.56
and because of the technical language

418.86 --> 424.139
that sometimes pop up in between all the

421.56 --> 425.819
Hindi you literally can just follow like

424.139 --> 429.66
oh he's

425.819 --> 431.88
he's like arguing for lockstep motion of

429.66 --> 433.259
gas and the other and the Flat Earth is

431.88 --> 434.699
trying to explain how that's not

433.259 --> 436.8
possible

434.699 --> 438.66
and it's just

436.8 --> 440.94
fascinating

438.66 --> 445.40000000000003
it was a real pleasure being on there

440.94 --> 445.4
and I will probably go on there again

447.479 --> 454.81899999999996
if I catch it live so yeah very

450.8 --> 454.819
interesting check it out

455.34 --> 460.4
Saudi Arwin is going International

460.979 --> 466.4
right here not yet it's already

463.02 --> 466.4
International of course but

467.24 --> 471.74
uh it was pretty cool

477.72 --> 481.68
hello by the way pjc net obviously

480.12 --> 483.72
cooler there too

481.68 --> 487.52
today yeah

483.72 --> 487.52000000000004
yeah that's why I got a t-shirt on again

489.78 --> 492.61999999999995
uh-huh

493.74 --> 501.90000000000003
right so that was that

498.68 --> 504.44
uh I went to bed really early yesterday

501.9 --> 504.44
actually

506.52 --> 511.31899999999996
really good idea I didn't know for sure

509.639 --> 513.539
if it was going to be

511.319 --> 516.12
hot again in the morning I just thought

513.539 --> 519.36
like I don't want to get I just needed

516.12 --> 521.58
to sleep and so I feel really rested a

519.36 --> 524.9590000000001
lot of energy

521.58 --> 524.9590000000001
can talk about anything

532.98 --> 537.1800000000001
yeah also Quantum conscious had another

536.04 --> 539.3389999999999
video

537.18 --> 543.06
like about the

539.339 --> 545.4590000000001
the autopilot he calls it the download

543.06 --> 548.64
I could I call that like a long time ago

545.459 --> 551.04
I call that the autopilot it's just

548.64 --> 553.68
we have certain frequency functions that

551.04 --> 555.7199999999999
your subconscious knows how it works and

553.68 --> 557.5799999999999
then you just like you just give in to

555.72 --> 560.48
it and you could even be shocked into

557.58 --> 562.14
doing that it's like a default mode

560.48 --> 565.019
autopilot

562.14 --> 567.86
and yeah great analysis

565.019 --> 567.86
romat

571.26 --> 576.0
I like those very simple Focus videos

574.5 --> 578.899
of his

576.0 --> 578.899
uh

586.68 --> 592.1999999999999
oh yeah did also of course continue

588.899 --> 595.019
watching that one video

592.2 --> 597.3000000000001
oh now I remember yeah

595.019 --> 599.94
I forgot to continue watching that video

597.3 --> 602.3599999999999
the very long one for four hours that I

599.94 --> 602.36
Linked UP

602.399 --> 606.839
did watch a big chunk of it but when I

604.44 --> 610.44
went on the Indian

606.839 --> 614.8800000000001
hang out I had to restart

610.44 --> 614.8800000000001
because my mic just discontinued

616.68 --> 624.1999999999999
and then yeah the page got downed and I

620.519 --> 624.2
forgot about it uh

627.62 --> 634.5600000000001
also watched this

631.26 --> 636.959
the second Austin Powers movie

634.56 --> 639.1199999999999
and

636.959 --> 642.2399999999999
yeah somebody already in chat yesterday

639.12 --> 647.18
said yeah it's it's exactly the same

642.24 --> 647.1800000000001
and it kind of is oh camera freeze

652.98 --> 656.54
yep me Frozen

656.94 --> 659.12
foreign

659.519 --> 665.519
but yeah it's exactly the same with the

662.459 --> 668.16
couple of ads and

665.519 --> 670.68
still in my mind it was better than it

668.16 --> 673.26
actually turned out to be but it was a

670.68 --> 675.54
little bit more entertaining than the

673.26 --> 676.86
first one which just felt so off in so

675.54 --> 680.64
many ways

676.86 --> 684.3000000000001
it's still not really impressive

680.64 --> 686.279
just ugh

684.3 --> 688.38
I wonder if I'm actually gonna go all

686.279 --> 691.5
the way and just watch the third one too

688.38 --> 695.279
see but I probably know what what it's

691.5 --> 697.88
going to be like now uh

695.279 --> 697.88
all right

703.26 --> 709.88
it's just I get the sensation of like

706.68 --> 709.88
what were they thinking

710.459 --> 717.68
it's it is so gravel the entire thing

714.42 --> 717.68
is so gravel

721.459 --> 727.279
yeah enough right so I did that

727.74 --> 733.32
hey lumpy gas in a vacuum clutch

731.22 --> 735.899
good to see you

733.32 --> 737.82
third is the third really

735.899 --> 740.3
the second one wasn't

737.82 --> 740.3000000000001
okay

741.42 --> 745.3389999999999
you watch The Time Machine one yes

750.54 --> 755.24
and it was kind of funny

755.88 --> 761.459
they did some meta humor also that

760.2 --> 765.5600000000001
like

761.459 --> 769.3199999999999
I am specifically not allergic to that

765.56 --> 771.56
I'm inoculated through felis and the

769.32 --> 771.5600000000001
movies

772.44 --> 778.09
but

774.86 --> 778.09
[Music]

781.74 --> 785.3
it was just really messy

789.66 --> 795.36
and also like that's really like I

793.32 --> 798.24
didn't even realize how freaking gross

795.36 --> 800.279
that supposed Fat Bastard character was

798.24 --> 801.6
to get in my belly I didn't even

800.279 --> 804.42
remember what that was about was he just

801.6 --> 808.62
like talking about eating babies

804.42 --> 811.26
like that's so graveled I mean

808.62 --> 813.6
they literally made a joke about a guy

811.26 --> 815.3389999999999
fat guy eating babies and that's funny

813.6 --> 819.12
now

815.339 --> 820.86
like really is it really though is that

819.12 --> 825.66
really funny

820.86 --> 828.98
no no not really it's really [ __ ] up

825.66 --> 828.98
it's so graveled

830.699 --> 840.9799999999999
ugh

832.15 --> 840.98
[Music]

841.26 --> 846.36
but also I'm still thinking back at just

843.839 --> 849.86
about the first movie and it's just

846.36 --> 849.86
that that was like

850.44 --> 855.48
six plus is just

852.959 --> 858.4799999999999
so messed up

855.48 --> 861.1800000000001
it's so wrong

858.48 --> 863.279
like I'm more outraged about that part

861.18 --> 865.019
than that it's just a stupid movie I

863.279 --> 866.88
mean if it would have just been set to

865.019 --> 870.72
like

866.88 --> 874.199
16 plus or 18 plus

870.72 --> 876.6600000000001
or like definitely PG or something like

874.199 --> 878.279
that but more just older than it would

876.66 --> 880.92
have been like oh yeah it's kind of

878.279 --> 883.4399999999999
goofy it's stupid it's spoof

880.92 --> 885.66
but yeah okay

883.44 --> 888.12
it's just like what the [ __ ] that's not

885.66 --> 890.06
you should not show that [ __ ] to kids

888.12 --> 892.44
ever

890.06 --> 894.06
anybody with half a brain should really

892.44 --> 896.2790000000001
knows that

894.06 --> 899.0
like

896.279 --> 899.0
uh

901.86 --> 904.399
what

905.76 --> 910.04
are you talking about lumpy gas in a

907.74 --> 910.04
vacuum

911.279 --> 917.3389999999999
you were calling out Austin

915.0 --> 920.06
on kiwi show

917.339 --> 920.0600000000001
what

920.76 --> 923.779
what are you talking about

925.5 --> 928.399
what's it

928.92 --> 932.66
what does they have to do with it

934.32 --> 939.0790000000001
hello by the way fiber oats good to see

936.899 --> 939.079
you

941.16 --> 945.8389999999999
pj13 in Canada

943.44 --> 950.839
yeah it's still

945.839 --> 950.839
better but I'd still say um

954.66 --> 960.54
but yeah PG-13 is better I can't believe

957.3 --> 963.4799999999999
that any country ever just

960.54 --> 965.16
did like six plus on that that's

963.48 --> 968.36
preposterous

965.16 --> 968.36
and outrageous

983.22 --> 988.6800000000001
First movies

985.5 --> 993.32
15 in the UK yeah makes sense second

988.68 --> 993.3199999999999
third 12. right

997.38 --> 1004.24
I still don't really see the 12. I mean

999.899 --> 1004.24
it's constant sex jokes everywhere

1004.759 --> 1009.259
I mean I guess that might appeal to like

1007.519 --> 1013.1
the

1009.259 --> 1017.019
newly awoken teenager as secret pleasure

1013.1 --> 1019.759
right but that should not be like

1017.019 --> 1021.98
opened up like that

1019.759 --> 1024.6200000000001
so you'd keep that all private so it's

1021.98 --> 1026.78
still it's well

1024.62 --> 1030.52
I don't know man

1026.78 --> 1030.52
I I'd keep it 15.

1031.52 --> 1038.199
but anyway yeah I'm not the

1034.76 --> 1038.199
person to designate

1039.559 --> 1045.86
and it's an older movie anyway

1042.559 --> 1047.539
but yeah ridiculous

1045.86 --> 1049.4599999999998
I feel kind of weird for actually

1047.539 --> 1054.46
watching them

1049.46 --> 1054.46
but I'm doing it as a reviewer sort of

1064.88 --> 1068.2990000000002
right but I don't want to talk about

1066.679 --> 1071.0800000000002
that all day

1068.299 --> 1071.08
if you don't mind

1071.299 --> 1076.66
I mean it's really not worth talking

1073.4 --> 1076.66
about that elaborately

1077.179 --> 1080.799
it's mostly just gross

1085.28 --> 1087.46
foreign

1100.64 --> 1107.0200000000002
so guys what have you been up to

1103.22 --> 1107.02
did any I noticed that

1108.74 --> 1115.34
Michael Khan was also in the chat on the

1112.88 --> 1117.7600000000002
Indian stream I mean Pakistani stream

1115.34 --> 1117.76
sorry

1119.02 --> 1122.86
anybody else see it

1123.02 --> 1129.28
anyway the link is still in the chat if

1126.679 --> 1129.2800000000002
you scroll up

1135.98 --> 1139.1200000000001
hello hello

1148.419 --> 1154.2990000000002
anybody still there or is it really

1151.34 --> 1154.299
early for you guys

1154.34 --> 1160.539
Danny Faulkner was in qe's house what

1157.46 --> 1160.539
what are you talking about

1161.66 --> 1165.76
link made no sense what

1171.679 --> 1174.5800000000002
no it's a

1174.74 --> 1178.96
I posted it like 13 minutes ago

1180.5 --> 1184.72
it's an hour five minutes

1190.94 --> 1196.5800000000002
ah clutch has definitely

1194.539 --> 1199.059
he has commented so I guess that he

1196.58 --> 1199.059
watched it

1206.299 --> 1211.82
Danny [ __ ] was there wow oh

1209.419 --> 1212.96
you mean Danny Faulkner was on ball

1211.82 --> 1216.22
busters

1212.96 --> 1216.22
I guess I missed him

1216.62 --> 1222.26
I was at some point I kind of was just

1219.44 --> 1225.28
making dinner and I think that I it took

1222.26 --> 1225.28
longer than expected

1228.08 --> 1232.72
huh

1229.88 --> 1232.72
that's weird

1235.76 --> 1240.5
it's like I walked out and then he came

1238.28 --> 1242.12
in

1240.5 --> 1244.48
because when I came back the show had

1242.12 --> 1244.4799999999998
ended

1248.08 --> 1254.6
you watched the moon fall stupid film

1251.12 --> 1258.52
but really enjoyable yeah I know right

1254.6 --> 1261.26
it is really dumb in a way it's like

1258.52 --> 1265.72
simpleton Style

1261.26 --> 1265.72
but it's still super entertaining and

1265.88 --> 1272.47
and like the CGI is freaking amazing

1269.34 --> 1272.47
[Music]

1283.68 --> 1287.38
[Music]

1296.24 --> 1298.419
foreign

1307.48 --> 1312.98
get into any details I mean I'm not

1309.919 --> 1315.3200000000002
gonna watch it back right now

1312.98 --> 1317.98
and I missed it so what what is it about

1315.32 --> 1317.98
was it

1321.2 --> 1324.4
what was the subject

1327.919 --> 1332.539
really weird by the way that I'm asking

1330.32 --> 1333.6789999999999
somebody in my chat when I was on that

1332.539 --> 1337.6
show but

1333.679 --> 1337.6000000000001
yeah I missed that part

1342.32 --> 1347.559
oh and hello flatter Sage by the way

1344.84 --> 1347.559
good to see you

1362.059 --> 1364.78
oh

1365.5 --> 1370.7
[Music]

1368.799 --> 1373.28
love it

1370.7 --> 1375.44
such a beautiful bottle of these

1373.28 --> 1378.26
and I had one for a very long time and

1375.44 --> 1381.0800000000002
literally it had just started to change

1378.26 --> 1383.78
color but it's because probably stuff

1381.08 --> 1385.82
that was just heaping up inside

1383.78 --> 1388.36
so I'm really glad to get like a clear

1385.82 --> 1388.36
new bottle

1393.3 --> 1398.78
[Music]

1396.5 --> 1401.9
so anybody's just

1398.78 --> 1405.28
gonna say anything in chat

1401.9 --> 1405.2800000000002
I'm asking questions

1408.71 --> 1412.88
[Music]

1410.539 --> 1414.919
you know if you ask questions I answer

1412.88 --> 1417.2600000000002
like

1414.919 --> 1420.8200000000002
rapidly

1417.26 --> 1420.82
I wish that would be mutual

1430.94 --> 1436.419
driving oh okay

1433.279 --> 1436.419
okay never mind

1436.64 --> 1439.419
uh

1446.6 --> 1451.24
do you think that's the end of The Ether

1448.82 --> 1451.24
wig

1452.48 --> 1455.44
well

1456.919 --> 1462.0800000000002
Iron Sky oh God yeah clutch yeah that

1460.1 --> 1463.4599999999998
movie sucks

1462.08 --> 1466.6399999999999
I mean

1463.46 --> 1469.1200000000001
it has interesting concept sort of but

1466.64 --> 1469.1200000000001
it sucks

1486.74 --> 1492.679
right so end of The Ether debate uh

1489.5 --> 1494.24
effectively like technically yes there

1492.679 --> 1495.8600000000001
is no easy debate I mean it's an

1494.24 --> 1499.1
aberration

1495.86 --> 1501.32
I'm very certain about that I can reason

1499.1 --> 1505.1589999999999
it out I can literally compare the

1501.32 --> 1507.32
structures of gravity aberration

1505.159 --> 1509.1200000000001
and ether aberration and it is

1507.32 --> 1511.36
remarkably similar they could be

1509.12 --> 1511.36
brothers

1511.82 --> 1516.98
right

1513.32 --> 1518.72
in in how people believe in them and

1516.98 --> 1521.6200000000001
what they like and how they build with

1518.72 --> 1525.559
it but they do with it they're Brothers

1521.62 --> 1527.059
aberration Brothers ether and gravity

1525.559 --> 1529.46
so

1527.059 --> 1531.86
people are still gonna hold on as people

1529.46 --> 1533.659
still hold on to gravity

1531.86 --> 1537.74
people are gonna hold on to Ether and

1533.659 --> 1539.1200000000001
ether is much easier even to hold on to

1537.74 --> 1542.059
than gravity

1539.12 --> 1545.2399999999998
gravity is in a way much more clumsy

1542.059 --> 1548.1789999999999
but yeah it's an integral part

1545.24 --> 1550.64
to the heliocentric cosmologies it

1548.179 --> 1553.52
cannot do without so

1550.64 --> 1554.72
that's what keeps it alive in people's

1553.52 --> 1559.539
minds

1554.72 --> 1559.539
The Ether however is yeah

1560.419 --> 1566.1200000000001
is a little bit more elusive there are

1563.96 --> 1568.94
so many open ends out there of

1566.12 --> 1570.26
understanding and things that have been

1568.94 --> 1572.96
noticed

1570.26 --> 1575.419
how it works and

1572.96 --> 1576.8600000000001
yeah so many Mysteries that are not just

1575.419 --> 1580.3600000000001
not answered

1576.86 --> 1583.1589999999999
and people have tendency to be impatient

1580.36 --> 1584.4799999999998
so they then just

1583.159 --> 1588.14
like

1584.48 --> 1592.7
they could brush and they just scoop up

1588.14 --> 1594.8600000000001
all these little Weird Mysteries

1592.7 --> 1596.8400000000001
and then it's like oh it sort of

1594.86 --> 1599.059
correlates and then they just like oh

1596.84 --> 1601.22
that means it's all ether all those

1599.059 --> 1603.62
things are the proof of ether

1601.22 --> 1608.02
and that's how they then hold on so it

1603.62 --> 1608.02
is like a a consolidation

1608.179 --> 1612.98
idea

1609.98 --> 1615.559
to in your mind try to fix all these

1612.98 --> 1618.34
Loose Ends of information that you might

1615.559 --> 1618.34
have bumped into

1619.76 --> 1623.919
that's what ether really is and that's

1622.159 --> 1628.1200000000001
why people are gonna hold on to it

1623.919 --> 1628.1200000000001
whether they can prove it or not

1629.84 --> 1634.0
ether is more abstract that's correct

1636.32 --> 1640.34
although gravity is quite abstract as

1638.72 --> 1643.46
well

1640.34 --> 1647.84
right gravity is more based on physical

1643.46 --> 1649.3400000000001
traits physical observations and ether

1647.84 --> 1652.1
is

1649.34 --> 1653.779
also rooted in some physical

1652.1 --> 1656.12
observations but is mostly

1653.779 --> 1659.12
philosophizing about that which isn't

1656.12 --> 1661.2199999999998
actually there it's just really bizarre

1659.12 --> 1663.86
that's what it eventually comes down to

1661.22 --> 1668.2
and that makes it completely abstract so

1663.86 --> 1668.1999999999998
yes Colin occupants

all these new accounts come in and they

1737.24 --> 1743.24
have

1738.64 --> 1747.63
annoying names that are like slightly

1743.24 --> 1750.02
gross or sexually hinted in ways

[Music]

1750.02 --> 1756.1399999999999

it's it's a certain

1756.14 --> 1761.24
category of people that is has a hobby

1759.38 --> 1764.2600000000002

1901.94 --> 1908.299
real scumbags out there that are just

1904.1 --> 1911.24
trying to shove names in my face because

1908.299 --> 1914.059
they want me to read it out and then say

1911.24 --> 1915.98

yeah love that [ __ ] and the movie

2025.419 --> 2032.22
although this is really gross now if I'd

2028.179 --> 2032.22
watch this back I'd feel really dirty

2044.919 --> 2047.919

2058.599 --> 2061.3790000000004
that's right

2062.74 --> 2068.8199999999997
but it's because it's so gross

2065.74 --> 2072.339
like these guys are such

2068.82 --> 2074.44
unbelievable extreme gammas

2072.339 --> 2076.599
it's like Gammas without the internet

2074.44 --> 2078.579
it's almost like thank God they didn't

2076.599 --> 2082.079
have internet

2078.579 --> 2086.44
because that would have been a nightmare

2082.079 --> 2090.78
it's like pre-internet trolls that's

2086.44 --> 2090.78
what bottom is is this a UK show yeah

2091.72 --> 2095.4599999999996
but they're like gross

2102.88 --> 2106.96
they're like the the setup is sort of

2105.88 --> 2109.6600000000003
like

2106.96 --> 2112.7200000000003
12 year old kids

2109.66 --> 2115.72
if they never grew up

2112.72 --> 2121.0789999999997
that's what the show really is like

2115.72 --> 2121.0789999999997
it's so incredibly silly and gross

2137.619 --> 2141.6600000000003
yes yes pjc net

2142.96 --> 2147.76
I don't think I've seen the movie but I

2145.42 --> 2149.26
did see the interview and I also know he

2147.76 --> 2151.48
like died

2149.26 --> 2153.4
soon after

2151.48 --> 2156.18
that was

2153.4 --> 2156.1800000000003
a really

2156.339 --> 2161.5
like Brave move you could say but he

2159.4 --> 2166.38
probably yeah

2161.5 --> 2166.38
he hit some really bad nerves doing that

2173.32 --> 2178.42
but yeah I did know he Rick Mayo did

2176.02 --> 2179.68
indeed do like a complete conspiracy

2178.42 --> 2182.44
thing

2179.68 --> 2185.14
oh out of nowhere was really unexpected

2182.44 --> 2186.82
and a lot of people were very pissed off

2185.14 --> 2190.0
at that

2186.82 --> 2193.0
I know because they told me

2190.0 --> 2195.76
Jesuit guy for example

2193.0 --> 2199.06
well they didn't tell me they just they

2195.76 --> 2201.5400000000004
showed it by their stance like

2199.06 --> 2205.06
they just wanted him to be that crazy

2201.54 --> 2208.54
gross lunatic and nothing else and that

2205.06 --> 2212.2599999999998
he did that probably got him killed

2208.54 --> 2213.94
because of how people saw him

2212.26 --> 2217.26
that's my

2213.94 --> 2217.26
theory about that

2228.7 --> 2231.52
yeah Jim West

2230.32 --> 2233.92
yeah

2231.52 --> 2235.119
I think Rick Mayo was actually a really

2233.92 --> 2237.94
good guy

2235.119 --> 2241.119
and it's like a clown totally

2237.94 --> 2244.06
self-shaming clown

2241.119 --> 2246.099
but manic

2244.06 --> 2249.119
and relentless

2246.099 --> 2249.119
and gross

2250.06 --> 2253.9
but he would turn out to be a really

2252.04 --> 2255.64
good guy underneath that

2253.9 --> 2259.8
and yeah

2255.64 --> 2259.7999999999997
realized that when he did that thing

2265.3 --> 2269.5
I should see if I can find that movie

2267.94 --> 2271.359
back

2269.5 --> 2274.3
maybe watch it

2271.359 --> 2277.24
I've never actually watched it maybe

2274.3 --> 2281.1600000000003
just like a Snippets of it and that's it

2277.24 --> 2281.16
hey Susie yes good to see you

2292.06 --> 2297.94
right but from what I had seen with that

2294.7 --> 2300.0989999999997
film from him it's it doesn't really

2297.94 --> 2302.02
feel like a movie it's more like a

2300.099 --> 2305.98
documentary it was really behind the

2302.02 --> 2308.38
scenes it's weird to see him the actor

2305.98 --> 2312.42
just be himself pretty much this is

2308.38 --> 2312.42
weird it's very weird to see

2316.72 --> 2321.3999999999996
anyway is that movie somewhere on

2318.88 --> 2323.02
YouTube or something if anybody could

2321.4 --> 2325.2000000000003
find that and Link it up that would be

2323.02 --> 2325.2
great

2356.56 --> 2360.64
yeah

2358.359 --> 2362.7999999999997
yeah Tony Whitcomb they did make a good

2360.64 --> 2365.0789999999997
point it was totally On Target

2362.8 --> 2366.88
I have

2365.079 --> 2369.3
a lot of people have turned off their

2366.88 --> 2369.3
television

2369.82 --> 2374.619
like they're never gonna go there again

2371.74 --> 2377.74
and besides they don't really need it

2374.619 --> 2380.7400000000002
the internet is much better

2377.74 --> 2381.9399999999996
now nothing gets truly forced on you you

2380.74 --> 2387.4799999999996
just have to

2381.94 --> 2387.48
be a little bit more of a navigator

2411.339 --> 2415.619
oh and by the way hello Tony Whitcomb

2417.339 --> 2421.0789999999997

yeah still got more than half a show

2788.56 --> 2792.48

2793.24 --> 2798.52

[Music]

2811.599 --> 2813.78
foreign

2824.079 --> 2829.8390000000004
ER

2826.839 --> 2832.44
welcome back did I miss the whole bunch

2829.839 --> 2832.44
of shows

2832.96 --> 2838.56
mostly me shirtless

2835.119 --> 2838.56
because it was so freaking hot

2838.72 --> 2845.0989999999997
I hope you're all right you didn't like

2841.119 --> 2845.099
get cooked during moving or something

2847.359 --> 2850.619
hey Matthew Hall

2855.46 --> 2858.7200000000003
yeah thank you for that

2858.94 --> 2864.46
indeed rogans it up indeed

2871.3 --> 2874.3590000000004
oh by the way I turned the comments off

2873.28 --> 2876.52
again

2874.359 --> 2878.68
apparently it took the trolls like a

2876.52 --> 2880.359
week to figure it out

2878.68 --> 2883.0589999999997
because when I turned it back on they

2880.359 --> 2884.5589999999997
just stopped they hadn't annoyingly

2883.059 --> 2886.48
commented

2884.559 --> 2888.76
and then they all figured out like oh

2886.48 --> 2891.52
you're doing it again so I just closed

2888.76 --> 2893.7000000000003
it off again because it just just go

2891.52 --> 2893.7
away

2904.96 --> 2909.3
a little short sentence today

2909.76 --> 2912.76
foreign

2939.56 --> 2942.75
[Music]

2945.64 --> 2947.64
um

2950.76 --> 2956.2000000000003
just browse around the news then

2984.7 --> 2987.66
no

2991.48 --> 2997.859
never mind it's just annoying

2995.079 --> 2997.8590000000004
uh

3000.059 --> 3005.579
less unbearably hot today yes Jim West

3002.66 --> 3009.02
definitely it's a much better that's why

3005.579 --> 3009.02
I'm sure wearing a shirt again

3021.72 --> 3024.68
go away

3025.44 --> 3032.7200000000003
damn it if it's not trolls it's flies

3029.16 --> 3032.72
nah just kidding

3041.94 --> 3048.96
a couple of degrees in the drop help yes

3046.02 --> 3051.119
and also just not having the sun shining

3048.96 --> 3055.16
directly on

3051.119 --> 3055.1600000000003
on my wall helped so much

3060.44 --> 3067.88
I'm gonna take a bit of breather

3063.96 --> 3067.88
some of that flowing wind out there

3095.52 --> 3100.579
ah

3097.26 --> 3100.579
just feels great

3100.92 --> 3104.579
oh good

3106.26 --> 3111.5400000000004
yes bladder Sage good question what do I

3109.2 --> 3114.7999999999997
think about that

3111.54 --> 3114.8
I think it's a stunt

3117.9 --> 3121.8
I've already said yeah I don't want to

3120.059 --> 3124.38
like Hammer off to what other people

3121.8 --> 3126.96
starting to like own Benjamin suspicions

3124.38 --> 3130.319
I I agree with him

3126.96 --> 3133.619
it like I think he probably

3130.319 --> 3136.14
like gave them gave the FBI a secret tip

3133.619 --> 3138.8
or just an open arrangement to do that

3136.14 --> 3138.7999999999997
as a stun

3153.48 --> 3158.579
so yeah I think that if Trump is

3156.119 --> 3161.46
probably just doing it to kind of like

3158.579 --> 3164.6400000000003
get some attention for when he's going

3161.46 --> 3168.559
to run for president again

3164.64 --> 3168.5589999999997
that's what they're saying about it

3171.18 --> 3174.9199999999996
hey Rob H good to see you

3182.16 --> 3187.6189999999997
ah

3184.8 --> 3191.2400000000002
all right Matthew

3187.619 --> 3191.2400000000002
yeah that's great

3193.14 --> 3199.319
uplifting cute animal videos yeah that's

3196.02 --> 3202.74
always a good mood Bender

3199.319 --> 3205.74
just don't drown in it too much

3202.74 --> 3205.74
like

3212.64 --> 3218.48
but yeah glad you're doing all right

3214.44 --> 3218.48
what was the situation again

3219.66 --> 3224.7799999999997
I mean a lot of things have been

3221.22 --> 3224.7799999999997
happening out there with people

3225.54 --> 3229.2799999999997
like at least G's dad and

3230.099 --> 3233.6600000000003
what was your situation again

3235.26 --> 3239.3390000000004
or is it just you're just generally

3237.42 --> 3241.44
following your advice like not to get

3239.339 --> 3243.54
too caught up in

3241.44 --> 3245.819
in the craziness of media because

3243.54 --> 3248.4
they're really trying to just hook you

3245.819 --> 3250.02
and then pull you into hell

3248.4 --> 3253.14
right

3250.02 --> 3256.319
from one perspective or another

3253.14 --> 3257.52
and it's just not good to to get into

3256.319 --> 3260.339
that

3257.52 --> 3263.28
especially when it's really hot

3260.339 --> 3266.22
because then you yeah getting excited

3263.28 --> 3269.7000000000003
makes you hotter it literally makes your

3266.22 --> 3271.859
blood boil it will overheat you

3269.7 --> 3276.02
so getting all excited when it's really

3271.859 --> 3276.02
hot is just not a good idea in general

3283.799 --> 3288.72
now people are talking about Trump and

3285.96 --> 3291.059
Paul's Maurice yeah so it was just but

3288.72 --> 3294.5589999999997
it to be fair it was an effective stunt

3291.059 --> 3294.559
it was really cheap

3297.96 --> 3303.839
I mean look to say oh he literally

3301.38 --> 3306.299
arranged it I don't know but he probably

3303.839 --> 3308.819
figured out that they were like really

3306.299 --> 3310.5
they're being pushed to be really eager

3308.819 --> 3314.099
to get

3310.5 --> 3316.74
the Republicans because of the Democrat

3314.099 --> 3320.88
policy of sort of

3316.74 --> 3324.24
and he just kind of easily tricked them

3320.88 --> 3327.6600000000003
or trolled them perhaps right to say oh

3324.24 --> 3331.02
it was he literally spoke to the FBI on

3327.66 --> 3333.1189999999997
the phone do this right

3331.02 --> 3335.819
I mean

3333.119 --> 3337.859
he would be able to do that

3335.819 --> 3339.839
would he do that

3337.859 --> 3341.88
I don't think he would even need to do

3339.839 --> 3343.44
that I think he just tricked them he

3341.88 --> 3346.859
just called like

3343.44 --> 3348.78
earlier this is so not really Trump

3346.859 --> 3351.0589999999997
yeah

3348.78 --> 3354.599
you gotta check out Trump's fault he got

3351.059 --> 3357.2400000000002
like secret illegal documents in there

3354.599 --> 3360.2400000000002
is not home right now

3357.24 --> 3362.3999999999996
you can go in there and get it

3360.24 --> 3365.1189999999997
I think it might have been just

3362.4 --> 3365.119
something like that

3370.44 --> 3374.579
but yeah he is getting attention and

3373.29 --> 3377.04
[Music]

3374.579 --> 3380.099
yeah we'll see

3377.04 --> 3382.02
the the first look first he's gotta he's

3380.099 --> 3385.1400000000003
gotta take a knee

3382.02 --> 3388.619
and not in the liberal way but against

3385.14 --> 3392.5789999999997
his actions to vaccine promotion he has

3388.619 --> 3396.299
to he has to submit like no Trump

3392.579 --> 3400.38
you were wrong bad Trump no oh but it

3396.299 --> 3403.319
was just dragging it was just trying to

3400.38 --> 3408.92
help the industry American American

3403.319 --> 3408.92
industry profit you know just chilling

3409.44 --> 3417.2400000000002
right no no no Trump no you bad bad

3413.76 --> 3421.079
Trump don't do that again you were bad

3417.24 --> 3424.319
no no vaccine vaccine not good bad Trump

3421.079 --> 3426.48
right and after that point if he truly

3424.319 --> 3429.42
takes that knee for that and just never

3426.48 --> 3431.819
does it again I'll be like hmm okay

3429.42 --> 3434.099
we'll see something good might come out

3431.819 --> 3435.96
of this but I don't know man I think

3434.099 --> 3438.42
that he secretly wants to be buddies

3435.96 --> 3440.64
with Bill Gates or something I don't

3438.42 --> 3442.38
know dude the guy is much weirder than

3440.64 --> 3444.92
you'd think

3442.38 --> 3444.92
foreign

3454.59 --> 3457.639
[Music]

3474.0 --> 3476.66
see

3481.079 --> 3486.079
wait what well Matthew Hall what are you

3483.72 --> 3486.0789999999997
talking about

3486.119 --> 3489.1400000000003
neighbors are trash

3489.48 --> 3493.7
lied to the police ah Jesus

3497.88 --> 3502.5
oh they're trying to bully you out oh my

3500.22 --> 3504.299
God Matthew Hall

3502.5 --> 3507.0
that's terrible

3504.299 --> 3509.7599999999998
I am so sorry to hear that that really

3507.0 --> 3511.68
sucks I know what it's like

3509.76 --> 3513.8390000000004
I mean it had a bit of an issue like

3511.68 --> 3516.4199999999996
that with my landlord and somehow it

3513.839 --> 3518.88
stabilized but that like when that that

3516.42 --> 3521.16
going on it's really [ __ ]

3518.88 --> 3525.359
when literally people that are just

3521.16 --> 3528.5989999999997
having fits are trying to attack you

3525.359 --> 3531.7799999999997
to get you out it's so sick

3528.599 --> 3533.76
I hope you uh keep your calm like keep

3531.78 --> 3535.28
your calm keep your wits know your

3533.76 --> 3538.079
rights

3535.28 --> 3540.42
and record [ __ ]

3538.079 --> 3542.2200000000003
like if like

3540.42 --> 3546.5
I don't know I don't know how bad they

3542.22 --> 3546.5
are just have a webcam or something

3547.02 --> 3549.799
and

3550.2 --> 3556.4399999999996
yeah like a security cam maybe it's

3552.9 --> 3560.52
something but like make sure that

3556.44 --> 3563.579
everything that happens is well recorded

3560.52 --> 3565.799
audio recording or that you keep the

3563.579 --> 3568.6800000000003
notes

3565.799 --> 3572.72
because you might need it later to just

3568.68 --> 3572.72
prove your Vantage Point

3575.7 --> 3580.3799999999997
but also if you're being like falsely

3578.22 --> 3584.339
set up if they're lying about what you

3580.38 --> 3586.94
do against the police like that's

3584.339 --> 3590.64
that is something you could get them on

3586.94 --> 3592.559
right once the police really figure out

3590.64 --> 3595.2
that they're basically just getting

3592.559 --> 3598.38
scammed by crazies

3595.2 --> 3600.0
like you could get if you could get them

3598.38 --> 3602.4
to realize that

3600.0 --> 3605.0
you can you could get really out of this

3602.4 --> 3605.0
really well

3615.18 --> 3618.72
being friendly in there as hard you're

3617.099 --> 3621.059
right yeah that that means there then

3618.72 --> 3623.52
that means that they're literally

3621.059 --> 3626.88
following a program to bully you out

3623.52 --> 3629.119
they have this decided to bully you out

3626.88 --> 3629.119
then

3629.22 --> 3633.9199999999996
and it's good that you've recorded it

3631.2 --> 3633.9199999999996
right

3641.599 --> 3649.6400000000003
yeah new vaccines new polio duh

3646.44 --> 3649.64
that's where it comes from

3660.72 --> 3666.5989999999997
now you cannot decide my recordings are

3663.119 --> 3667.92
private because the police requested it

3666.599 --> 3669.78
well okay

3667.92 --> 3671.94
well I mean there's worse things in the

3669.78 --> 3674.4
world I mean just

3671.94 --> 3675.96
just be

3674.4 --> 3677.88
on your toes

3675.96 --> 3681.119
or what do you call that make sure that

3677.88 --> 3683.46
you're sharp right I always assume that

3681.119 --> 3685.079
everything I I say is being recorded

3683.46 --> 3687.059
even

3685.079 --> 3688.619
when I'm not not on the phone or

3687.059 --> 3692.0400000000004
something always

3688.619 --> 3694.02
it's I just always act like that right

3692.04 --> 3696.599
because even if something electronic

3694.02 --> 3699.2
isn't listening in then God is still

3696.599 --> 3699.2000000000003
listening in

3704.88 --> 3709.7400000000002
right but the thing is it is the these

3707.4 --> 3712.319
situations are like a test and if you

3709.74 --> 3716.64
get through it and you hold your wits

3712.319 --> 3718.579
with you and you hold your wits about

3716.64 --> 3720.839
foreign

3718.579 --> 3723.6600000000003
you'll get something good out of it

3720.839 --> 3727.0789999999997
maybe not like money or something but

3723.66 --> 3730.22
good energy like when I went through the

3727.079 --> 3732.7200000000003
whole crisis sort of with my landlord

3730.22 --> 3734.0989999999997
what by the way it was probably

3732.72 --> 3735.9599999999996
instigated because of one of those

3734.099 --> 3738.6600000000003
roommates it had literally been just

3735.96 --> 3742.079
making up crazy rumors about me to him

3738.66 --> 3743.819
and he's like very paranoid so he

3742.079 --> 3746.94
literally thought that I was like a

3743.819 --> 3749.22
crazy psychopath that was just sneaking

3746.94 --> 3751.7400000000002
like threatening people and [ __ ] to

3749.22 --> 3755.64
their face secretly it really [ __ ] up

3751.74 --> 3759.1189999999997
something like that it was just not good

3755.64 --> 3761.52
but yeah police got involved like and we

3759.119 --> 3765.0
had around the table hearing about it

3761.52 --> 3767.16
with the police with my landlord and my

3765.0 --> 3771.299
social worker

3767.16 --> 3774.24
and then worked out really well for me

3771.299 --> 3776.819
because the situation I was very clear I

3774.24 --> 3778.2599999999998
was not aggressive not agitated in the

3776.819 --> 3781.2599999999998
slightest ones I had that under control

3778.26 --> 3783.78
perfectly and landlord went kind of ape

3781.26 --> 3786.6600000000003
[ __ ] he literally went ape [ __ ] not

3783.78 --> 3790.2000000000003
yelling but just like accusing without

3786.66 --> 3793.5
any proof just really bizarre behavior

3790.2 --> 3796.7599999999998
and they all identified it and then now

3793.5 --> 3796.76
I'm really solid

3797.339 --> 3801.92
I

3798.66 --> 3801.92
oh hey

3809.059 --> 3814.8590000000004
right one of the roommates came back

3812.339 --> 3817.44
yesterday I mean she was still there had

3814.859 --> 3819.119
my door open ah

3817.44 --> 3822.359
but anyway

3819.119 --> 3824.76
after that point I was really solid I I

3822.359 --> 3828.7799999999997
haven't had like a police visit because

3824.76 --> 3832.079
of me being loud even

3828.78 --> 3834.8390000000004
ever since that moment Mike

3832.079 --> 3838.2000000000003
and I have been loud

3834.839 --> 3840.5389999999998
if you can all remember this is I

3838.2 --> 3843.4199999999996
definitely have been

3840.539 --> 3846.599
no not new girlfriend come on if I had a

3843.42 --> 3850.319
new girlfriend you'll know about it God

3846.599 --> 3850.319
no that's roommate

3850.5 --> 3853.94
I have three roommates

3858.0 --> 3862.859
two of them are on vacation this one was

3861.059 --> 3865.099
on vacation but apparently just came

3862.859 --> 3865.0989999999997
back

3866.7 --> 3872.0389999999998
although I think that she's probably

3868.68 --> 3874.819
gonna go back to like her hometown again

3872.039 --> 3874.8190000000004
later today

3892.38 --> 3896.359
Bob has been throwing up oh

3900.299 --> 3903.319
what the hell

3905.4 --> 3912.96
throwing up that's weird Matthew are you

3908.94 --> 3915.0
sure it's not that he's not like been

3912.96 --> 3917.7
I mean if they're really [ __ ] up they

3915.0 --> 3920.16
would try to like feed your dog

3917.7 --> 3923.52
chocolate because everybody knows that

3920.16 --> 3925.68
chocolate's terrible for dogs

3923.52 --> 3928.98
are you sure it hasn't been poisoned I

3925.68 --> 3930.7799999999997
mean to just like get physically ill for

3928.98 --> 3933.059
a dog from stress

3930.78 --> 3936.1800000000003
like unless they're kind of a standard

3933.059 --> 3939.559
Basket Case that's really bizarre are

3936.18 --> 3939.5589999999997
you sure it hasn't been poisoned

3950.119 --> 3956.039
landlords can be bastards well PJ seen

3953.16 --> 3958.94
it in my case it was literally he was

3956.039 --> 3958.94
just being lied to

3959.28 --> 3963.3590000000004
and he was trying to be responsible he

3961.68 --> 3964.5589999999997
thought that I was kind of a dangerous

3963.359 --> 3967.619
criminal

3964.559 --> 3969.96
that was threatening his

3967.619 --> 3971.6400000000003
yeah

3969.96 --> 3973.88
his customers

3971.64 --> 3976.68
he really thought that it was ridiculous

3973.88 --> 3980.099
that he believed that but he was trying

3976.68 --> 3982.319
to act honestly and ever I never took it

3980.099 --> 3984.48
as like oh you want to get me don't you

3982.319 --> 3987.42
no I never took it like that it was an

3984.48 --> 3989.94
honest mistake he's just kind of

3987.42 --> 3992.46
stupid a bit when it comes to those

3989.94 --> 3995.2400000000002
things exactly it was an accident I know

3992.46 --> 3995.2400000000002
it was an accident

3996.78 --> 4002.119
from his side he just got paranoid and

3999.839 --> 4006.339
carried away and he hasn't done that

4002.119 --> 4006.339
since he's like we're good now

4014.18 --> 4022.7599999999998
right it was it was a roommate crazy

4018.819 --> 4027.2599999999998
liberal lesbian

4022.76 --> 4027.26
drug using liar

4027.38 --> 4034.28
she had been literally lying about me

4031.099 --> 4036.619
behind my back and not like acting like

4034.28 --> 4039.5
nothing was happening I had never talked

4036.619 --> 4042.559
to her like one time in that entire

4039.5 --> 4045.079
period She had been lying about me

4042.559 --> 4047.6600000000003
to my landlord without even telling me

4045.079 --> 4049.76
without even communicating like not

4047.66 --> 4052.3999999999996
talking to each other

4049.76 --> 4055.039
except for hey or

4052.4 --> 4056.96
like uh could you please clean up this

4055.039 --> 4058.88
mess you just left behind

4056.96 --> 4059.839
in the shower something like that right

4058.88 --> 4062.619
that

4059.839 --> 4062.619
basic

4062.66 --> 4067.18
maintenance communication that's it

4068.119 --> 4071.9
anyway it's boring right Matthew Hall

4070.819 --> 4075.579
you're still in the middle of your

4071.9 --> 4075.579
situation it's different of course

4075.619 --> 4080.9
because your neighbors are really kind

4078.44 --> 4083.14
of have set their minds on getting you

4080.9 --> 4083.14
away

4087.38 --> 4092.02
oh okay you don't want to talk about

4089.24 --> 4092.02
okay sorry

4100.759 --> 4105.64
oh dog's already old okay

4103.64 --> 4105.64
um

4107.779 --> 4112.779
Council worker taking his soil oh yeah

4115.159 --> 4117.639999999999
good

4118.1 --> 4121.64
I mean I would be curious as to what the

4120.199 --> 4123.98
hell that would be that they're just

4121.64 --> 4125.839
like is that like paint garbage or

4123.98 --> 4126.799
something something yeah what would that

4125.839 --> 4129.219
be

4126.799 --> 4129.219
anyway

4129.799 --> 4134.44
just hold in there tight and keep your

4131.96 --> 4134.44
nerves

4150.56 --> 4157.0
what turret wow your neighbors really

4153.44 --> 4157.0
suck then damn

4163.9 --> 4167.98
do I game often

4170.659 --> 4177.4
I mostly just played the same games over

4174.739 --> 4177.4
and over again

4178.4 --> 4183.0199999999995
but uh yeah I try not to play too many

4181.159 --> 4185.8589999999995
hours a day because it's just not really

4183.02 --> 4185.859
healthy to do that

4190.8 --> 4193.839
[Music]

4206.3 --> 4211.46
right but yeah Jim West I'm not uh like

4209.12 --> 4214.46
I'm not a first person

4211.46 --> 4219.76
type of gamer at all

4214.46 --> 4224.9
I like mostly strategy and

4219.76 --> 4228.679
development type games with yeah

4224.9 --> 4231.44
so I like civilization five it's a game

4228.679 --> 4233.92
I've played so much it's like

4231.44 --> 4236.78
I know everything about it

4233.92 --> 4239.3
and it's really weird because I also

4236.78 --> 4242.8
know how it was all gravel like how they

4239.3 --> 4246.1990000000005
have the entire science development tree

4242.8 --> 4249.26
like I know everything about those

4246.199 --> 4251.719
things now but every section and how it

4249.26 --> 4254.42
was gravel and how it was rearranged and

4251.719 --> 4256.4
yeah they did a very decent way of just

4254.42 --> 4258.26
kind of stringing it together in a sort

4256.4 --> 4259.339999999999
of linear setting it was very well

4258.26 --> 4262.04
developed

4259.34 --> 4265.06
it has absolutely nothing to do with how

4262.04 --> 4265.06
that really works though

4265.219 --> 4269.78
but I like the game I like the music

4267.62 --> 4271.699
it's a lot of classical and I really

4269.78 --> 4273.32
like that

4271.699 --> 4275.239
which was really funny by the way

4273.32 --> 4277.219
because when I watched moonfall the

4275.239 --> 4279.98
other day

4277.219 --> 4282.199
they played a song like at some point

4279.98 --> 4284.78
was it

4282.199 --> 4288.08
the

4284.78 --> 4289.639999999999
the director for NASA or something the

4288.08 --> 4292.88
the woman one of the main characters

4289.64 --> 4293.96
went to NASA to check out the secret

4292.88 --> 4297.26
file

4293.96 --> 4300.04
and then this older guy in a wheelchair

4297.26 --> 4302.900000000001
was playing like a classical music song

4300.04 --> 4306.44
and that is one of the songs that also

4302.9 --> 4309.32
is a very regular come by

4306.44 --> 4311.0
in the game civilization 5 that I play

4309.32 --> 4314.0199999999995
so it was like Hey is he playing

4311.0 --> 4316.52
civilization five there NASA person

4314.02 --> 4318.1990000000005
who's probably bored out of his mind

4316.52 --> 4320.900000000001
yeah you're probably playing

4318.199 --> 4323.419999999999
civilization 5 there off screen aren't

4320.9 --> 4326.0
you that's literally what I thought when

4323.42 --> 4328.1
I heard that it was hilarious

4326.0 --> 4332.06
huh

4328.1 --> 4335.06
love to play me in boo

4332.06 --> 4336.860000000001
no I only play solo

4335.06 --> 4340.219
I mean I've never even tried playing

4336.86 --> 4342.44
that versus another person I would get

4340.219 --> 4346.0
really annoyed

4342.44 --> 4346.0
because I I like just

4346.4 --> 4352.28
I have a very specific style of play

4348.98 --> 4354.919999999999
it's just I like to do it that way

4352.28 --> 4357.8
I mean I could maybe one time is sort of

4354.92 --> 4358.52
a la land setting or maybe we could do

4357.8 --> 4360.8
it

4358.52 --> 4363.580000000001
I mean why not I've never even tried it

4360.8 --> 4363.58
not even once

4364.28 --> 4369.739
when it comes to like playing together

4366.32 --> 4370.84
with other people I prefer usually I

4369.739 --> 4373.759999999999
prefer

4370.84 --> 4376.58
Cooperative type games

4373.76 --> 4377.719
and gets competitive I can get like kind

4376.58 --> 4381.219
of dark

4377.719 --> 4381.219
sometimes I don't like it

4382.46 --> 4386.659
well I probably wouldn't get dark like

4384.56 --> 4389.96
that anymore but I'm like very fanatical

4386.659 --> 4393.259999999999
with games when it's competitive

4389.96 --> 4395.84
so I just like the co-op games

4393.26 --> 4399.26
really or solo

4395.84 --> 4402.8
because then I can just like

4399.26 --> 4405.679
be angry at the AI for just uh you are

4402.8 --> 4407.900000000001
evil enemy stupid robot you're trying to

4405.679 --> 4409.4
mind control me I know what you do I

4407.9 --> 4411.679
know how you work

4409.4 --> 4413.42
you can never have that kind of attitude

4411.679 --> 4416.62
towards another person that would be

4413.42 --> 4416.62
extremely dishonorable

4418.46 --> 4420.46
um

4421.04 --> 4424.0
bruh

4425.3 --> 4432.04
don't be scared

4427.219 --> 4432.04
really clutch I'm sorry

4433.58 --> 4439.699
I mean I've only played and finished

4437.239 --> 4442.339999999999
this game like

4439.699 --> 4445.419999999999
2 000 times or so

4442.34 --> 4445.42
probably more

4446.54 --> 4451.84
good League

4448.699 --> 4451.839999999999
I don't know what that is

4462.92 --> 4467.84
by the way did anybody check out the

4464.9 --> 4470.42
video that I did link to yesterday

4467.84 --> 4473.679
from mind unveiled

4470.42 --> 4473.679
about Chesterton

4474.62 --> 4477.14
or what is it

4476.77 --> 4478.6990000000005
[Music]

4477.14 --> 4481.04
um

4478.699 --> 4483.678999999999
the video I linked to yesterday

4481.04 --> 4484.94
I mean there was so much information it

4483.679 --> 4487.52
was

4484.94 --> 4490.5199999999995
he really presented like the cognitive

4487.52 --> 4492.5
dissonance between the generally

4490.52 --> 4494.780000000001
laid out story

4492.5 --> 4496.46
and how what was probably really

4494.78 --> 4498.44
happening it was one of the most

4496.46 --> 4500.719
detailed

4498.44 --> 4504.5599999999995
historical analysis that I've come

4500.719 --> 4507.38
across on video so far to date there was

4504.56 --> 4509.4800000000005
so much refined detail he had thought

4507.38 --> 4511.400000000001
about it so carefully

4509.48 --> 4512.659
that's probably why it's a four hour

4511.4 --> 4514.759999999999
show

4512.659 --> 4516.62
it's really good

4514.76 --> 4519.1990000000005
so I hope you checked that out it was

4516.62 --> 4521.239
very well worth watching if you're

4519.199 --> 4524.239
interested in that and how history was

4521.239 --> 4526.759999999999
probably completely different

4524.239 --> 4528.98
and really weird things were going on

4526.76 --> 4530.780000000001
especially during the Renaissance I mean

4528.98 --> 4533.12
the Renaissance

4530.78 --> 4536.32
might not be what we all think it

4533.12 --> 4536.32
actually is

4538.159 --> 4542.659
it's weird

4539.9 --> 4543.86
it he really had me in a moment where I

4542.659 --> 4546.259999999999
was like

4543.86 --> 4549.799999999999
oh [ __ ]

4546.26 --> 4551.780000000001
was it completely the opposite of what

4549.8 --> 4554.3
we've all been thought it was

4551.78 --> 4556.719
was the Renaissance actually like the

4554.3 --> 4560.320000000001
fall of the good times

4556.719 --> 4560.32
so weird

4578.6 --> 4584.06
okay George Sanford

4581.54 --> 4586.159
it sounds like a first person type game

4584.06 --> 4588.080000000001
and you'll probably do need a big

4586.159 --> 4591.98
computer for bed

4588.08 --> 4594.94
because they drain a lot of energy and

4591.98 --> 4594.94
calculation power

4601.1 --> 4605.42
yeah right Susie yes I definitely

4602.84 --> 4608.6
recommend it's very long

4605.42 --> 4611.12
and the guy reads out very monotone so

4608.6 --> 4612.860000000001
it is four hours of pretty much monoton

4611.12 --> 4615.98
stuff but

4612.86 --> 4618.5599999999995
like the actual content is really worth

4615.98 --> 4622.339999999999
it in my opinion

4618.56 --> 4625.1
really worth just getting a feel for it

4622.34 --> 4627.9800000000005
and just his view on it is just very

4625.1 --> 4630.5
very refined and careful

4627.98 --> 4632.919999999999
I liked it

4630.5 --> 4632.92
oh

4641.659 --> 4647.42
moments of the Three Kingdoms what no

4645.26 --> 4650.06
never heard of that clutch

4647.42 --> 4652.46
best strategy game that's quite a

4650.06 --> 4654.679
statement there's

4652.46 --> 4658.4800000000005
thousands

4654.679 --> 4658.4800000000005
pretty decent strategy games

4662.48 --> 4669.339999999999
for me the best strategy games are the

4665.42 --> 4669.34
ones that are the least buggy

4669.8 --> 4675.679
that's pretty much it because nothing

4672.26 --> 4677.3
ruins the strategy game like bucks out

4675.679 --> 4679.58
of any sort

4677.3 --> 4682.58
whether it is just interface there's

4679.58 --> 4685.38
just things that are not natural or

4682.58 --> 4688.59
that there's just like graphic anomalies

4685.38 --> 4688.59
[Music]

4700.1 --> 4703.6990000000005
all right but the funny thing about any

4701.84 --> 4705.8
strategy game is that

4703.699 --> 4708.86
you could just add on more elements but

4705.8 --> 4710.78
that doesn't necessarily make it better

4708.86 --> 4713.9
that's the weird thing sometimes

4710.78 --> 4716.84
Simplicity in the right setting with the

4713.9 --> 4719.239
right Focus for the player can be

4716.84 --> 4721.219
extremely elaborate in what you can do

4719.239 --> 4723.5
with it and can have like thousands of

4721.219 --> 4726.32
hours of

4723.5 --> 4729.86
development spiritually here just

4726.32 --> 4733.04
enjoyment thinking while playing

4729.86 --> 4735.5599999999995
right well the same game with more

4733.04 --> 4736.94
add-ons can literally ruin the whole

4735.56 --> 4738.92
game

4736.94 --> 4742.759999999999
so it's always every strategy game is

4738.92 --> 4745.52
always a very careful balance between

4742.76 --> 4748.219
activities

4745.52 --> 4750.5
and objective and if you have just too

4748.219 --> 4753.7390000000005
much things you need to take care of or

4750.5 --> 4757.0
do it's going to Railroad your actual

4753.739 --> 4757.0
strategical creativity

4763.52 --> 4769.34
email yeah well that's logical but

4766.1 --> 4772.6990000000005
usually usually Power Balance within

4769.34 --> 4775.28
strategy is like the primary thing that

4772.699 --> 4777.678999999999
every strategy games get right because

4775.28 --> 4779.84
if there's a blatant imbalance it's just

4777.679 --> 4781.88
broken as a game and then everybody

4779.84 --> 4784.6
recognizes it

4781.88 --> 4784.6
so

4785.12 --> 4791.12
like the in-game balance

4788.42 --> 4794.36
they usually

4791.12 --> 4796.719
spend a lot of time on getting that part

4794.36 --> 4796.719
right

4797.179 --> 4803.3
it's just that

4800.239 --> 4806.48
is it still enjoyable

4803.3 --> 4808.820000000001
to play it with the options that are

4806.48 --> 4810.379999999999
required or available that's another

4808.82 --> 4812.84
matter

4810.38 --> 4814.6
because people also have different feels

4812.84 --> 4816.92
for it some people like like

4814.6 --> 4818.900000000001
micromanagement hell they like it it's

4816.92 --> 4820.639
like yeah I could do all of that I'll

4818.9 --> 4822.32
have every every thick and detail and

4820.639 --> 4824.36
right and then it's like magnificent

4822.32 --> 4826.4
result if you're not into that it's like

4824.36 --> 4829.099999999999
I don't want to do this [ __ ] all the

4826.4 --> 4832.28
time I don't want to do that I wanna

4829.1 --> 4834.5
just be more like a bit of a stair guy

4832.28 --> 4837.08
then you want less options so it all

4834.5 --> 4839.12
depends right I'm not much of a

4837.08 --> 4841.04
micromanagement guy

4839.12 --> 4843.8
like that

4841.04 --> 4845.659
although sometimes I I like it if the

4843.8 --> 4848.42
strategy game gives an option for that

4845.659 --> 4851.48
where you can just be generally staring

4848.42 --> 4853.88
but also like zoom in on a very specific

4851.48 --> 4856.339999999999
detail and then micromanage that with a

4853.88 --> 4858.92
positive result but not in a way that

4856.34 --> 4860.78
like the entire game always depends on

4858.92 --> 4862.52
you having to do that to reach your

4860.78 --> 4864.98
success

4862.52 --> 4866.780000000001
but that's very difficult for yeah to

4864.98 --> 4868.638999999999
balance out

4866.78 --> 4871.9
you got to have a management team that

4868.639 --> 4871.900000000001
even has that objective

4878.12 --> 4882.32
yeah you might be able to tell that I

4880.46 --> 4884.54
used to have Ambitions to become a game

4882.32 --> 4887.92
designer

4884.54 --> 4887.92
but that's a long time ago

4898.88 --> 4901.900000000001
okay clutch

4911.9 --> 4916.0599999999995
but what is it called exactly

4934.1 --> 4936.9400000000005
clutch

4939.56 --> 4943.9400000000005
I mean

4941.36 --> 4945.98
what you wrote out

4943.94 --> 4948.799999999999
when you mentioned it it's not clear

4945.98 --> 4951.138999999999
exactly what the name is you didn't

4948.8 --> 4953.659000000001
capital lettler letter the name or

4951.139 --> 4956.1990000000005
anything so what are you talking about

4953.659 --> 4956.199
exactly

4960.199 --> 4966.919999999999
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is that it

4964.58 --> 4969.92
or is that like a catch-all name for a

4966.92 --> 4973.28
series because I'm gonna have to like

4969.92 --> 4974.96
actually search the name

4973.28 --> 4978.099999999999
and if you don't get the name right

4974.96 --> 4978.1
you're not gonna find it

4989.659 --> 4994.96
oh cool PJ CNET well at least you got

4992.179 --> 4994.96
something out of it

4995.06 --> 4997.659000000001
awesome

5005.679 --> 5009.88
yeah turn based is the best because then

5007.96 --> 5010.9
you can just walk away and come back

5009.88 --> 5013.719
later

5010.9 --> 5016.0199999999995
without it having any consequence I

5013.719 --> 5016.02
agree

5016.84 --> 5022.84
I don't like games that like demand a

5020.199 --> 5025.0
chunk of time from out of your life that

5022.84 --> 5027.900000000001
you can't walk away from I don't like it

5025.0 --> 5027.9
when games do that

5043.12 --> 5049.659
but dude you're I'm literally watching

5046.719 --> 5053.44

6207.54 --> 6214.0199999999995
I even had I I had that one time I do

6210.54 --> 6216.659
like it I do like hummus

6214.02 --> 6219.540000000001
it's just not like a staple food thing

6216.659 --> 6222.659
for me it just isn't why

6219.54 --> 6224.76
because red and toast

6222.659 --> 6228.08
and putting things on it are not

6224.76 --> 6228.08
standard for me at all

6228.119 --> 6233.5199999999995
the only thing I ever take on bread is

6230.88 --> 6235.32
like baked eggs or hamburgers that's

6233.52 --> 6237.619000000001
like the only thing I even eat bread

6235.32 --> 6237.619
with

6239.219 --> 6242.42
like a sliced bread

6245.52 --> 6252.1990000000005
or yogurt

6247.8 --> 6252.1990000000005
uh garlic I know nah

6254.34 --> 6258.8
oh that's tatsiki nah

6258.96 --> 6263.36
no I don't really like that either

6266.52 --> 6271.8
but like sliced cucumber

6269.88 --> 6274.400000000001
like really fine slice like little

6271.8 --> 6274.400000000001
threads

6274.86 --> 6280.799999999999
and then like a little bit of orange

6277.5 --> 6282.96
juice I mean lemon juice

6280.8 --> 6285.96
and some honey in there

6282.96 --> 6288.199
that's really refreshing have you tried

6285.96 --> 6288.199
that

6291.239 --> 6295.379999999999
you can have it like on the side of a

6293.28 --> 6299.219
meal or something

6295.38 --> 6304.46
or just like that really refreshing

6299.219 --> 6304.46
just very fine sliced cucumber

6305.1 --> 6309.119000000001
a little bit of Honey some orange juice

6307.38 --> 6310.619
mix it up

6309.119 --> 6313.0199999999995
great

6310.619 --> 6314.639
especially when it's really hot super

6313.02 --> 6316.56
basic

6314.639 --> 6318.119
you gotta like cucumber if you don't

6316.56 --> 6319.38
like cucumber then you're not gonna like

6318.119 --> 6322.219
it

6319.38 --> 6322.219
I love it

6329.76 --> 6335.54
sounds delicious yeah it is delicious

6332.219 --> 6335.54
and really refreshing

6345.179 --> 6352.26
yeah I know that because like my

6348.659 --> 6356.839999999999
my parents used to make that sometimes

6352.26 --> 6356.84
and I really liked it it's yeah

6362.76 --> 6368.159000000001
and I had because also I had trouble

6365.1 --> 6370.5
like eating vegetables and

6368.159 --> 6371.94
like salad and all that when I was

6370.5 --> 6374.82
younger

6371.94 --> 6378.48
but that thing was like one of the first

6374.82 --> 6379.619
the vegetable things that I ever liked

6378.48 --> 6382.799999999999
like

6379.619 --> 6383.92
fine sliced cucumber threads

6382.8 --> 6385.679
with some honey

6383.92 --> 6389.6990000000005
[Music]

6385.679 --> 6392.34
and some orange keep saying orange lemon

6389.699 --> 6394.799999999999
juice I think they also added some olive

6392.34 --> 6396.78
oil or something a little drop I don't

6394.8 --> 6398.639
know exactly what but it mostly the

6396.78 --> 6400.5
thing that I remember is the honey and

6398.639 --> 6402.3
the lemon juice

6400.5 --> 6404.88
the Cucumber

6402.3 --> 6406.02
you might put some other things on there

6404.88 --> 6408.54
too

6406.02 --> 6411.0
I think they put Dill in there but I

6408.54 --> 6413.54
don't know if that's like really

6411.0 --> 6413.54
necessary

6413.639 --> 6415.639
um

6432.9 --> 6438.719
okay coconut water orange juice teaspoon

6436.619 --> 6442.08
hmm

6438.719 --> 6444.96
I guess that could work Jim West

6442.08 --> 6448.08
I'm not a fan of the taste of coconut

6444.96 --> 6450.06
water though and when I say that I mean

6448.08 --> 6453.9
like eel

6450.06 --> 6456.900000000001
tried it once it was so gross

6453.9 --> 6458.82
I like couldn't finish it

6456.9 --> 6462.5599999999995
but maybe if you mix it up with some

6458.82 --> 6462.5599999999995
other stuff that it's more doable

6504.96 --> 6511.139
one in

in one of the spinach bins at work what

6511.139 --> 6515.46

6527.82 --> 6532.699
the spinach bin that somebody just put

6529.5 --> 6532.699
it there by accident or

6545.04 --> 6551.179
okay Susie s

6547.619 --> 6551.179
that sounds like dinner talk

6569.82 --> 6574.259999999999

6571.86 --> 6576.5599999999995

6581.76 --> 6585.619000000001
wow I got the food talk going

6586.679 --> 6592.02
oh man by the way talking about which

6589.08 --> 6592.98
like QE shows recently in the last two

6592.02 --> 6595.8
weeks

6592.98 --> 6597.718999999999
like he had a distinct lack of talk

6595.8 --> 6599.6990000000005
about food

6597.719 --> 6601.679
Thomas Chuck

6599.699 --> 6603.419999999999
I mean there's gonna be a food to talk

6601.679 --> 6605.52
shortage now

6603.42 --> 6608.31
so I thought maybe I

6605.52 --> 6611.459000000001
talk about food a little today

6608.31 --> 6611.459000000001
[Music]

6645.84 --> 6651.32
is there a Reverb in Europe yeah

6651.84 --> 6656.9400000000005
you did it wrong or in a pie

6654.179 --> 6659.4
oh there's all kinds of things like I

6656.94 --> 6661.5
don't particularly like it that much

6659.4 --> 6662.94
but there was this thing that we used to

6661.5 --> 6665.28
do

6662.94 --> 6668.339999999999
take the rhubarb

6665.28 --> 6671.46
and then like cook it cook it until it's

6668.34 --> 6674.84
like this weird thready stuff

6671.46 --> 6674.84
and then add sugar

6675.54 --> 6681.84
because it's really sour not just like

6678.3 --> 6684.2390000000005
that so you gotta like sugar it up

6681.84 --> 6687.659000000001
and then you can like mix it with

6684.239 --> 6689.82
custard or something really that's

6687.659 --> 6692.9
we used to eat it like from our own

6689.82 --> 6692.9
garden rhubarb

6694.679 --> 6699.78
yeah the stem you cook it

6697.44 --> 6701.46
until it just becomes this weird mushy

6699.78 --> 6704.639
thready stuff

6701.46 --> 6706.32
is really sour so you probably want to

6704.639 --> 6708.119
add some sugar to that or something

6706.32 --> 6710.04
sweetening

6708.119 --> 6713.639
because if you just gonna eat it just

6710.04 --> 6715.82
like that it's really sour

6713.639 --> 6715.82
foreign

6723.599 --> 6729.06
not that I like it yet I was never a big

6725.94 --> 6733.739
fan of it but my parents were

6729.06 --> 6739.76
and so we used to like do that and then

6733.739 --> 6739.759999999999
combine it with uh yeah custard or

6742.94 --> 6748.44
like the Milky

6746.099 --> 6750.619000000001
the old Mode God damn it why do you call

6799.98 --> 6804.919999999999
so my camera and sound is all over the

6802.44 --> 6804.919999999999
place today

6805.139 --> 6811.6990000000005
is uh quite a messy show I'd say

6817.56 --> 6823.56
it's almost over

6820.02 --> 6826.820000000001
so at least it was fun but messy a

6823.56 --> 6826.820000000001
little unfocused but

6826.92 --> 6830.719
didn't have to get angry at all

[Music]

6845.28 --> 6849.08
what's that stuff called again

6849.119 --> 6853.46
wait how long ago did I cut out

6858.119 --> 6862.44
rice pudding no I was talking about

6861.179 --> 6865.32
custard

6862.44 --> 6868.678999999999
Custard with rebarber

6865.32 --> 6870.42
combines good the vanilla custard is

6868.679 --> 6873.5
typically sweet

6870.42 --> 6873.5
15 into oh

6877.199 --> 6881.46
so the custard is sweet and then you put

6879.179 --> 6884.159
the rebarber stuff

6881.46 --> 6887.04
like the cooked stuff on there which is

6884.159 --> 6891.259999999999
really sour but together it works great

6887.04 --> 6891.26
that's how we used to eat rhubarbra

6893.94 --> 6898.4
it's been a long time since I even had

6896.099 --> 6898.400000000001
that

6902.46 --> 6907.02
but I think that it's really healthy

6904.44 --> 6908.28
stuff because it has like vitamin C in

6907.02 --> 6910.139
it or something

6908.28 --> 6912.739
which is not surprising because it's

6910.139 --> 6912.7390000000005
really sour

6915.9 --> 6921.299999999999
yeah I don't eat too much you get

6918.119 --> 6923.4
diarrhea that will happen yeah

6921.3 --> 6926.46
like it's not something you want to like

6923.4 --> 6930.08
Chuck down like a leader of that stuff

6926.46 --> 6930.08
you're probably gonna get sick

6942.96 --> 6949.679
and rhubarb right in Dutch it's called a

6947.639 --> 6951.659000000001
barber

6949.679 --> 6954.2390000000005
so

6951.659 --> 6956.699
I don't even I've never even heard an

6954.239 --> 6959.36
English person pronounce

6956.699 --> 6959.36
that

6959.88 --> 6964.9800000000005
so I'm a bit

6961.699 --> 6967.32
mixing it up by accident verbally

6964.98 --> 6970.0199999999995
because I call it a barber

6967.32 --> 6972.799999999999
you call it rhubarb

6970.02 --> 6972.8
I take it

6973.98 --> 6977.48
yeah thought so

6982.619 --> 6985.04
right right

7015.98 --> 7021.138999999999
weird by the way letter Sage I didn't

7019.04 --> 7023.48
even know that about it

7021.139 --> 7026.06
that's weird that the stock would be

7023.48 --> 7029.178999999999
edible but that the the leaves would be

7026.06 --> 7030.860000000001
poison like poison poison or just not

7029.179 --> 7033.639
very healthy

7030.86 --> 7033.639
that's weird

7052.04 --> 7056.5
good insect ribbon huh

7056.599 --> 7062.139
poison poison okay I didn't know that I

7058.88 --> 7062.139
didn't even know that's interesting

7062.659 --> 7068.239
my parents hadn't told me then again I

7065.719 --> 7069.26
was not super interested in at that time

7068.239 --> 7070.94
but

7069.26 --> 7072.679
I had no idea

7070.94 --> 7076.659
that the rest of
