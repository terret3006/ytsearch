have the chemtrails that I did see and

92.59 --> 98.81
even showed on camera just seemed kind

95.84 --> 100.58
of like either flow away or dissipate

98.81 --> 104.42
because there didn't seem to be much

100.58 --> 106.52
left when the night came anyway there's

104.42 --> 110.319
a plane flying over right now there and

106.52 --> 112.97
it's just leaving a contrail it's

110.319 --> 114.5
completely dissipating after certain

112.97 --> 117.14
distance I don't know if you can see

114.5 --> 121.7
this with anyway it's yeah beautiful

117.14 --> 122.479
weather like even the wind is kind of

121.7 --> 129.649
warm now

122.479 --> 135.55
so almost filled light feels like a mild

129.649 --> 135.55
summer day in a way yeah fairly nicely

137.18 --> 149.1
hmm all right so let's see who is in

144.3 --> 151.55

usually happens but yeah anyway I got

167.19 --> 170.0
green tea with me

177.36 --> 188.31900000000002
sorry yeah yeah yesterday evening and

182.95 --> 191.319
night was crazy it was it was there of

188.319 --> 193.81
course was ball busters before yeah oh I

191.319 --> 195.79
almost forgot about ball busters because

193.81 --> 198.81900000000002
I watched Owen Benjamin I actually

195.79 --> 201.909
caught when he just went live and it was

198.819 --> 203.85899999999998
it was just awesome and then I saw

201.909 --> 207.76
notification Oh ball busters I thought

203.859 --> 210.43
oh premier but then I looked and it was

207.76 --> 216.14999999999998
actually just life so I was oh wait

210.43 --> 220.56900000000002
quickly let's get in there and yeah I

216.15 --> 222.549
was having a lot of fun I'm mostly

220.569 --> 224.67999999999998
listening in the background I had a few

222.549 --> 226.359
beers it's so typical you know it's

224.68 --> 228.43
Saturday evening it's actually going

226.359 --> 233.04000000000002
live I kind of forget about it just

228.43 --> 240.519
think yay Saturday evening and then oh

233.04 --> 244.22899999999998
wait but yeah after that after the

240.519 --> 246.669
ballbuster show it was pretty decent and

244.229 --> 251.65
afterward yeah it was kind of slow in a

246.669 --> 253.54000000000002
bit in a way but it's just I don't know

251.65 --> 254.949
if I explained it life or that it's

253.54 --> 257.32
gonna appear you have to show it's just

254.949 --> 259.41900000000004
like yeah or what else do I get to add

257.32 --> 264.4
at this point it's just so blatantly

259.419 --> 266.919
clear everything I can't even find a a

264.4 --> 270.76
Legolas moment where I can say actually

266.919 --> 273.33
this and this no it's just it's that's

270.76 --> 273.33
just it

273.72 --> 281.86
you watched Riley uh nice to see you

277.27 --> 283.659
last night oh I didn't know thank right

281.86 --> 288.19
but anyway after the ball busters was

283.659 --> 289.06
over it kind of still continues like in

288.19 --> 294.669
the discord

289.06 --> 298.63
so myself Nathan a couple of others and

294.669 --> 302.08
ballers including Mark Collard were in

298.63 --> 304.93
there and that literally kept on going

302.08 --> 307.57
until like four o'clock and Nathan was

304.93 --> 310.029
basically doing debate level trying to

307.57 --> 314.579
get through to mark color because

310.029 --> 320.61899999999997
he was like yeah acting Brenda level and

314.579 --> 324.159
doing was it Ellen B type giggly laughs

320.619 --> 327.639
every time because he just he had

324.159 --> 329.529
nowhere to go argument argument wise but

327.639 --> 331.92900000000003
he just wouldn't drop he couldn't let it

329.529 --> 335.229
go so it was it was crazy went on for

331.929 --> 338.339
hours and it just it wasn't even being

335.229 --> 341.169
recorded and he was just like it debates

338.339 --> 343.959
it's so bizarre and Nathan by the way

341.169 --> 352.80899999999997
had that luxury because he was alone at

343.959 --> 355.829
home so he was really at it it wasn't on

352.809 --> 359.649
24/7 it was still on the ball busters

355.829 --> 363.099
this court panel but after the show had

359.649 --> 368.699
stopped and that went on for hours and

363.099 --> 368.699
hours and hours was crazy

382.29 --> 391.5
yeah I'm getting a lot of new videos via

386.7 --> 393.53999999999996
skype groups and all that some yeah and

391.5 --> 395.91
through news channels like things are

393.54 --> 398.64000000000004
getting more heated concerning to

395.91 --> 403.17
suppose with her own emergency like even

398.64 --> 405.3
my standard sub mainstream news channels

403.17 --> 410.88
alternative news are just like really

405.3 --> 418.40000000000003
forwarding this let's see what's this

410.88 --> 421.419
example where's this from

418.4 --> 421.419
all right this is

422.86 --> 435.67
is the United States I think this whole

430.3 --> 439.81
dumb wait Ellsbury right okay so this is

435.67 --> 442.54
this is England and yeah basically about

439.81 --> 444.79
people you know getting arrested for

442.54 --> 449.56
going to a hospital showing it's

444.79 --> 452.29
completely empty life that so that's

449.56 --> 456.52
like it's getting through this stuff is

452.29 --> 464.71000000000004
getting through and oh yeah also

456.52 --> 470.16999999999996
apparently Flat Earth poker right he

464.71 --> 476.28
even got into a US News situation that

470.17 --> 479.62
was crazy man Karen be forwarded this

476.28 --> 481.09
[ __ ] I wonder if I could play the video

479.62 --> 491.62
have to be careful with that

481.09 --> 496.65999999999997
all right two minutes forty Oh what is

491.62 --> 499.92
this I think that she filmed it on the

496.66 --> 503.31
TV okay this I guess this should be

499.92 --> 503.31
doable right

503.77 --> 509.60999999999996
okay I'm gonna present it hold on

521.389 --> 525.199
wait no no

530.25 --> 536.279
yah that should do it

533.59 --> 536.279
okay

544.15 --> 551.5
right okay so yeah its own Skype so it

548.03 --> 551.5
stood in the way can play it right now

553.96 --> 604.75
hope the sound [ __ ] gets through come

557.09 --> 604.75
on follow midlow to Flat Earth poker

661.82 --> 666.12
walking through royal colombian hospital

664.38 --> 668.25
over the weekend he says he was

666.12 --> 671.34
investigating whether the pandemic is

668.25 --> 673.95
real in a lengthy phone call the floor

671.34 --> 675.96
use farmer studied his freedoms under 18

673.95 --> 680.63
Charter do not believe everything he's

675.96 --> 680.63
told here's what he has to say

684.86 --> 687.98
[Music]

712.329 --> 721.939
well look who's talking buddy

715.959 --> 730.3699999999999
look who's talking buddy yeah that's

721.939 --> 737.8
just freaky isn't it yeah so that

730.37 --> 743.319
happened and typical Corona denier and

737.8 --> 743.319
Flat Earth believer yay

757.16 --> 768.56
yes isn't it Missouri bear its it's a

761.81 --> 769.75
giant Bluff it really is just like I

768.56 --> 772.3399999999999
said yesterday

769.75 --> 773.54
I'm surprised yesterday didn't even get

772.34 --> 779.02
a strike or something

773.54 --> 779.02
I was pretty outspoken yesterday

786.32 --> 794.5500000000001
anyway yeah and beside that there was

790.14 --> 798.0
another video it was bit I think it was

794.55 --> 802.1999999999999
it it was directly on YouTube from

798.0 --> 804.59
Nathan Thompson that also kind of

802.2 --> 809.7900000000001
creeped me out yeah he uploaded it

804.59 --> 811.0500000000001
roughly two hours ago I can't really

809.79 --> 813.99
play that for you it's kind of boring

811.05 --> 817.5
it's like over ten minutes it's a it's

813.99 --> 825.45
technical it's a guy oh you know what

817.5 --> 828.17
I'll just show the and the view of it

825.45 --> 828.1700000000001
for a second

831.25 --> 843.279
all right so this device all right you

835.72 --> 845.5
know what I'll flick through it see this

843.279 --> 851.259
device apparently in Britain is being

845.5 --> 854.43
installed and he knows that about the

851.259 --> 857.8000000000001
technicals of this hold on let me

854.43 --> 862.75
resolution come on okay that's it

857.8 --> 864.79
apparently so yeah and there's there's a

862.75 --> 867.67
device in this a specific type of

864.79 --> 872.139
two-way antenna this thing and that's

867.67 --> 874.4799999999999
illegal technology like officially

872.139 --> 875.649
that's like even government's not

874.48 --> 880.1800000000001
allowed to do that

875.649 --> 883.74
and these things are just being

880.18 --> 890.189
installed like that as part of the 5g

883.74 --> 893.5790000000001
rollout I guess and it's just nuts

890.189 --> 897.5999999999999
they're just they're they're breaking

893.579 --> 897.5999999999999
the social contract

902.05 --> 906.9699999999999
so yeah that's a creepy development I

904.149 --> 912.67
personally have not seen devices like

906.97 --> 913.6600000000001
this anywhere yet and also not in the

912.67 --> 916.329
past so it's not like they've been

913.66 --> 919.059
secretly installed somewhere because

916.329 --> 921.0089999999999
yeah I would have remembered like wait

919.059 --> 923.67
I've seen one of these but I haven't so

921.009 --> 927.5790000000001
far at least not that I can remember I

923.67 --> 930.67
that can't be no not in the city here

927.579 --> 936.939
and yeah before that like six years ago

930.67 --> 939.389
I don't know I don't think so but yeah

936.939 --> 939.389
that's happening

944.15 --> 946.84
all right

960.45 --> 969.2090000000001
right but like these devices can be used

964.11 --> 976.47
to literally scan very yeah on a

969.209 --> 979.1099999999999
detailed level they have like

976.47 --> 983.49
penetrating scan capabilities it is

979.11 --> 985.74
pretty high-tech it's it's yeah you can

983.49 --> 988.139
be assured that like secret surfaces use

985.74 --> 992.87
that kind of technology but this is

988.139 --> 997.29
being used as a as a public utility and

992.87 --> 1000.44
it just violates rights on an incredible

997.29 --> 1003.3499999999999
level privacy rights and yeah with

1000.44 --> 1006.47
health risk and all that it's just it's

1003.35 --> 1013.49
crazy that this is just being done like

1006.47 --> 1016.5400000000001
that so yeah that kind of that kind of

1013.49 --> 1016.54
got me a little worried

1025.959 --> 1035.39
obaid 60 RMC yes I do remember that yeah

1030.62 --> 1037.75
Bill Gates was like the monopoly he was

1035.39 --> 1043.8700000000001
like the first one to really monopolize

1037.75 --> 1043.87
to industrial even monopolize situations

1044.05 --> 1050.27
like buy up competitions to destroy them

1047.27 --> 1054.11
pretty overtly you know that that's

1050.27 --> 1056.3899999999999
right it was he was infamous for that he

1054.11 --> 1060.11
still is of course but now he is more

1056.39 --> 1062.42
all about all about the vaccines and all

1060.11 --> 1064.85
that and the and climate change

1062.42 --> 1068.0900000000001
population control that's what people

1064.85 --> 1071.27
know him for now much more

1068.09 --> 1071.27
[Music]

1076.74 --> 1081.75
no I don't remember dank I wasn't there

1100.37 --> 1107.1499999999999
I was thinking about couldn't you take

1102.59 --> 1118.03
to make a drone take a sleeve to place

1107.15 --> 1121.7900000000002
over the antenna maybe maybe you could

1118.03 --> 1127.49
potentially have like a bag that has

1121.79 --> 1129.559
like metal thread like the the weave

1127.49 --> 1133.82
would be would have like metallic

1129.559 --> 1136.3999999999999
aspects to it so that it would have a is

1133.82 --> 1138.8
it Faraday cage almost like effect and

1136.4 --> 1142.0900000000001
then you could potentially just put a

1138.8 --> 1146.09
bag over it and that would completely

1142.09 --> 1148.73
disable all its functions maybe I don't

1146.09 --> 1152.7099999999998
know you'd have to ask an electrician

1148.73 --> 1152.71
I'm not a really an electrician you know

1173.02 --> 1179.3899999999999
well Missouri berry yes normally that

1176.18 --> 1183.26
that's how that works but these things

1179.39 --> 1185.75
are not just normal antennas so it might

1183.26 --> 1188.03
not work as well as you would think and

1185.75 --> 1190.49
that's why I say you'd have to ask a

1188.03 --> 1192.3799999999999
somebody that actually knows about these

1190.49 --> 1196.82
systems like for example the guy that

1192.38 --> 1203.39
made the video that I just shared he's

1196.82 --> 1206.6
yeah he's called mark Steele and in the

1203.39 --> 1208.8500000000001
Nathan you know what I'll just put the

1206.6 --> 1212.27
link Nathan Thompson's video and Chad to

1208.85 --> 1216.53
subscribe to him is very serious flat

1212.27 --> 1219.05
earther and activist so in the

1216.53 --> 1225.46
description of that video there there is

1219.05 --> 1225.46
a description of this guy and some links

1226.06 --> 1234.86
wait a sword even as well hmm

1229.04 --> 1242.24
hold on alright so here is the B

1234.86 --> 1245.86
original video okay this is the one that

1242.24 --> 1249.02
this is the guy so I don't know maybe

1245.86 --> 1252.1699999999998
people could just message him ask him

1249.02 --> 1254.6
whatever maybe has other videos that

1252.17 --> 1256.73
does explain exactly about this sort of

1254.6 --> 1260.9199999999998
thing I this is I've just seen this

1256.73 --> 1260.92
video do like half an hour ago that's it

1261.84 --> 1264.8799999999999
[Music]

1265.92 --> 1275.309
can be oh you linked me up with another

1269.7 --> 1277.8300000000002
video did you related to those lights

1275.309 --> 1280.85
what which lights which lights are you

1277.83 --> 1280.85
talking about Karen B

1294.119 --> 1301.799
all right yeah there's a slight issue

1297.549 --> 1304.4189999999999
with videos on skype and that is that I

1301.799 --> 1314.86
can't listen to them and then turn off

1304.419 --> 1322.0590000000002
the volume and well see plenty of people

1314.86 --> 1327.629
in chat by now 33 watching the one you

1322.059 --> 1327.629
just showed okay

1333.89 --> 1347.75
oh right okay thank you dank yeah that

1337.58 --> 1349.9399999999998
is the okay I I think I probably glanced

1347.75 --> 1354.61
over this at some point but you know

1349.94 --> 1357.1100000000001
it's just the news mansion and you know

1354.61 --> 1359.09
other things happen and you forget it

1357.11 --> 1363.2299999999998
kind of forget about it again but yeah

1359.09 --> 1363.77
thank you for providing the evidence for

1363.23 --> 1369.26
your claim

1363.77 --> 1371.59
thank appreciated the one I just showed

1369.26 --> 1371.59
Oh

1377.049 --> 1383.99

oh so there that's weird

1445.57 --> 1456.58
so they're kind of disguised like land

1449.2 --> 1460.059
posts I see all right what is it like

1456.58 --> 1462.629
lamps do they have lamp capability in

1460.059 --> 1462.629
them as well

1468.6 --> 1479.1699999999998
anyway these things looks it look

1470.86 --> 1482.2299999999998
extremely recognizable especially the

1479.17 --> 1486.059
antenna is just visible so yeah

1482.23 --> 1486.059
shouldn't be too hard to track down

1486.6 --> 1489.74

1580.88 --> 1589.4
I don't know if if they follow it up on

1587.39 --> 1591.2
it or it just left it to the test I'm

1589.4 --> 1593.93
not even too sure anymore in the

1591.2 --> 1599.56
Netherlands I really hope they they

1593.93 --> 1599.5600000000002
passed on it it's insane to do that like

1608.269 --> 1617.419
like these this technology it just

1612.759 --> 1622.249
disrupts certain energy frequencies that

1617.419 --> 1628.0700000000002
are kind of part of the help have to

1622.249 --> 1630.289
describe it spirit energy of I don't

1628.07 --> 1632.45
know just the the ability to function on

1630.289 --> 1635.6589999999999
a spiritual level for certain type of

1632.45 --> 1640.94
creatures and potentially even certain

1635.659 --> 1644.709
aspects of us and like this stuff is

1640.94 --> 1651.1390000000001
just disrupting and yeah that link that

1644.709 --> 1655.3890000000001
article it will just certainly kill off

1651.139 --> 1659.4499999999998
a whole pile of birds just like that

1655.389 --> 1663.559
like they just snap inside like short

1659.45 --> 1667.039
circuits and they just die bang it's

1663.559 --> 1670.219
messed up nobody needs 5g I've been

1667.039 --> 1673.959
saying it for years that I can't

1670.219 --> 1676.329
emphasize it enough there is no positive

1673.959 --> 1679.329
constructive need for this technology

1676.329 --> 1679.329
whatsoever

1681.159 --> 1684.159
it's

1685.51 --> 1692.11
the negative side options and abilities

1689.83 --> 1695.4099999999999
that are that are kind of part of the

1692.11 --> 1698.6999999999998
technology is it's too much there's just

1695.41 --> 1701.809
no good can come of it

1734.43 --> 1739.55
Hey hello Baldy cats long time no see

1755.19 --> 1763.8200000000002
anyway yeah I wonder how long it's gonna

1758.46 --> 1767.3700000000001
take before I don't know these

1763.82 --> 1769.35
grassroots journalists the conspiracy

1767.37 --> 1771.75
theorists that are upping the level

1769.35 --> 1775.08
thanks to the internet and just mobile

1771.75 --> 1777.48
technology basically taking over even

1775.08 --> 1781.98
where the alternative media got up got

1777.48 --> 1783.78
stuck up in political narratives right

1781.98 --> 1786.81
because that did happen to a lot of

1783.78 --> 1788.61
alternative media they got stuck up into

1786.81 --> 1793.1399999999999
political narratives which have plenty

1788.61 --> 1795.3899999999999
for them to keep on going right but the

1793.14 --> 1799.0200000000002
grassroots the the real people that just

1795.39 --> 1802.41
do stuff go out there and film something

1799.02 --> 1804.99
or test it they're really the bear the

1802.41 --> 1807.0
grassroots the cut off grassroots

1804.99 --> 1809.67
journalists they they don't have a plan

1807.0 --> 1813.72
they just do things expose data just

1809.67 --> 1815.46
like that it is grassroots journalism

1813.72 --> 1817.73
it's just not organized it's not

1815.46 --> 1819.63
professional it's just or well maybe

1817.73 --> 1822.18
semi-professional you know YouTube

1819.63 --> 1827.49
channel or something but it's just they

1822.18 --> 1832.5
do stuff and now it's their right

1827.49 --> 1834.99
I wonder what's gonna happen just like

1832.5 --> 1838.32
people are gonna see that one way or the

1834.99 --> 1842.01
other just because the curiosity so what

1838.32 --> 1849.1699999999998
it's like how many crazy things need to

1842.01 --> 1849.17
happen before people really start to get

1849.29 --> 1857.85
that the government spell is literally

1854.79 --> 1860.1
not what it says it is it's like when

1857.85 --> 1863.58
are they gonna figure out that they

1860.1 --> 1867.99
can't go along anymore that going along

1863.58 --> 1868.6699999999998
and it starts to imply Russian Roulette

1867.99 --> 1872.64
games

1868.67 --> 1876.5700000000002
literally with no no we're not even a

1872.64 --> 1878.3600000000001
reward like the only reward you can win

1876.57 --> 1882.0
out of it is just blissful ignorance

1878.36 --> 1884.4599999999998
sort of while you deteriorate from

1882.0 --> 1887.82
everything that's happening but yeah

1884.46 --> 1888.809
that's it how much do they people need

1887.82 --> 1892.499
to see

1888.809 --> 1898.74
happening before like they really spring

1892.499 --> 1902.49
into action like do people literally

1898.74 --> 1904.2
just need to suddenly where I don't know

1902.49 --> 1907.379
this I don't even want to go there

1904.2 --> 1909.509
really but like what if like certain

1907.379 --> 1913.4989999999998
places there are five key stations for

1909.509 --> 1915.059
example and they the people kind of

1913.499 --> 1919.8890000000001
ignore it they're like where I'll stay

1915.059 --> 1922.049
inside and then people I don't know if

1919.889 --> 1923.789
my kid is crazy as that people will

1922.049 --> 1925.499
watch us walk by these things and then

1923.789 --> 1927.299
suddenly just drop that and start

1925.499 --> 1929.1000000000001
bleeding out of their nose and [ __ ] and

1927.299 --> 1930.69
out of their eyes and then other people

1929.1 --> 1933.059
come over then it's like whoa what

1930.69 --> 1935.009
happens and it happens to them too and

1933.059 --> 1940.1689999999999
it just happens when they get too close

1935.009 --> 1944.19
to this thing like yeah how what's it

1940.169 --> 1946.98
gonna take how crazy do things have to

1944.19 --> 1952.019
get before people really start to figure

1946.98 --> 1955.95
out like this they've broken the civil

1952.019 --> 1957.98
contract the government is not doing

1955.95 --> 1959.97
anymore

1957.98 --> 1964.039
what a government should be doing

1959.97 --> 1964.039
according to the social contract

1966.549 --> 1973.179
yeah so get it now dari that's

1970.519 --> 1973.179
ridiculous

1977.73 --> 1984.82
or maybe it's not I don't know I don't

1981.76 --> 1986.56
even want to see I don't I don't

1984.82 --> 1988.74
necessarily even want to like see

1986.56 --> 1992.86
executions and all that you know that's

1988.74 --> 1997.42
it's just all a romantic reach like that

1992.86 --> 2000.9299999999998
no I just want people to subtly just

1997.42 --> 2004.0700000000002
rise out of their ignorance based

2000.93 --> 2006.63
slavery and actually take some

2004.07 --> 2012.56
responsibility at least to fix the

2006.63 --> 2016.8000000000002
situation on a longer run and not just

2012.56 --> 2020.1499999999999
not just the short just just one step

2016.8 --> 2020.1499999999999
away you know

2025.76 --> 2029.779
yeah that's it

2045.64 --> 2048.739
[Music]

2056.65 --> 2064.4300000000003
okay 101 Rock hyung but how is that

2059.9 --> 2067.19
gonna work really like even if you

2064.43 --> 2069.83
cancel your five do subscription or

2067.19 --> 2074.4700000000003
whatever that doesn't mean that the

2069.83 --> 2074.47
stations are going to go offline okay

2080.58 --> 2087.0
it's not gonna help if these things are

2085.32 --> 2090.8700000000003
installed they're just gonna be

2087.0 --> 2093.679
installed there and I don't know I think

2090.87 --> 2098.67
that even you could probably consider

2093.679 --> 2101.55
that the internet capabilities that it's

2098.67 --> 2106.71
supposed to provide are actually kind of

2101.55 --> 2110.19
secondary and not the main priority of

2106.71 --> 2112.16
it being there you see what I mean so

2110.19 --> 2115.32
even if people would then oh say oh I've

2112.16 --> 2117.2999999999997
canceled five g's subscription yet the

2115.32 --> 2122.03
things still gonna be there doing what

2117.3 --> 2122.03
it's designated to do you see

2141.93 --> 2144.71
hey Adam

2193.75 --> 2202.369
now the wind is getting kind of strong

2196.43 --> 2205.6699999999996
sometimes it's like one of the days

2202.369 --> 2208.339
where doors will be smacking because

2205.67 --> 2210.319
people will go outside but yeah leave

2208.339 --> 2218.69
the door open it's gonna smack at some

2210.319 --> 2221.74
point that's why I reached my door in

2218.69 --> 2221.7400000000002
between two shoes

2233.13 --> 2241.869
well Missouri bear the gaming community

2236.019 --> 2243.91
is just it's just a mindless yeah they

2241.869 --> 2247.2690000000002
just want to be amused they just want to

2243.91 --> 2251.8289999999997
do what they like more no matter really

2247.269 --> 2255.49
the consequences but yeah it's

2251.829 --> 2258.369
ridiculous because any serious gamer

2255.49 --> 2261.9399999999996
then I'm gonna do it through mobile [ __ ]

2258.369 --> 2265.4500000000003
they're gonna get a yeah a serious

2261.94 --> 2267.789
gaming console or PC or something that

2265.45 --> 2270.7889999999998
is kind of a desktop situation and

2267.789 --> 2273.2200000000003
what's stopping you from just using a

2270.789 --> 2277.4990000000003
internet landline which is going to be

2273.22 --> 2281.4399999999996
like 10 times faster anyway

2277.499 --> 2284.3799999999997
it's absolutely superfluous there is

2281.44 --> 2287.19
literally just no good reason at all

2284.38 --> 2290.109
from any perspective that is

2287.19 --> 2291.9990000000003
constructive in any way to have five

2290.109 --> 2296.4
years just and now it's completely

2291.999 --> 2296.3999999999996
useless it really is

2315.34 --> 2319.5
it is for them not us I

2326.68 --> 2335.1699999999996
I don't know maybe I've heard it's like

2331.96 --> 2338.7400000000002
a big bear brought that up on Benjamin

2335.17 --> 2342.4900000000002
was it three days ago I think something

2338.74 --> 2346.39
like that about yeah it is for them it

2342.49 --> 2349.75
is for thee for the the gamma [ __ ] the

2346.39 --> 2352.5099999999998
hive the hive they just want to be in

2349.75 --> 2355.69
their cities and whack off the porn all

2352.51 --> 2358.9
day and be all fearful spiralling about

2355.69 --> 2360.73
Corona and social justice and just go

2358.9 --> 2363.4300000000003
completely nuts and that it's supposed

2360.73 --> 2366.6
to be for them for the ones that beg for

2363.43 --> 2370.3599999999997
it it's an interesting idea

2366.6 --> 2373.27
but on the other hand yeah it's just

2370.36 --> 2376.3900000000003
these five G things are just installed

2373.27 --> 2378.85
in neighborhoods that aren't necessarily

2376.39 --> 2383.23
all super liberal or anything you know

2378.85 --> 2386.08
or liberal in in such a bad way it's not

2383.23 --> 2388.21
Grandma hive liberal because I don't

2386.08 --> 2390.25
know maybe the gamma rife places we'll

2388.21 --> 2393.76
just ask for it and they will get it and

2390.25 --> 2398.22
nobody will object to it whatever but

2393.76 --> 2398.2200000000003
it's not just those places though

drawing hmm did you make a doggy it's

2426.76 --> 2430.5600000000004
nice not bad

2436.869 --> 2440.039
nice one dank

2449.369 --> 2458.579
right well you know what look any kind

2453.509 --> 2460.799
of internet issue that may be there it's

2458.579 --> 2463.529
like oh we have such an internet Lee

2460.799 --> 2467.93
place these days and yeah there are like

2463.529 --> 2470.91
joking issue sometimes you know well

2467.93 --> 2474.69
there is another way of fixing it you

2470.91 --> 2482.3089999999997
know you know how you do that get glass

2474.69 --> 2486.15
fiber get like a a regional glass fiber

2482.309 --> 2489.539
network like and put it well anywhere

2486.15 --> 2492.44
that'll accept it and it suddenly what

2489.539 --> 2496.4990000000003
guess what guess what you have like I

2492.44 --> 2499.559
don't know a thousand megabits per

2496.499 --> 2501.569
second type of line and it's just like

2499.559 --> 2505.0190000000002
yeah it's that is there and it's all a

2501.569 --> 2507.509
matter of whether your provider is

2505.019 --> 2510.2099999999996
allowing you to get the full power out

2507.509 --> 2512.009
of that or not you know depending on if

2510.21 --> 2515.719
they're even still allowed to do it like

2512.009 --> 2518.249
that the government's gonna I don't know

2515.719 --> 2520.559
ration bandwidth I don't know where it

2518.249 --> 2525.479
could go with that you know but the the

2520.559 --> 2530.6090000000004
real best solution is just a giant glass

2525.479 --> 2532.5589999999997
fiber network you just put those lines

2530.609 --> 2534.5989999999997
everywhere and yeah you try to account

2532.559 --> 2537.9300000000003
for any problems that might happen

2534.599 --> 2540.42
including environmental problems I don't

2537.93 --> 2542.0989999999997
know earthquake zones it might not be as

2540.42 --> 2544.739
nice for earthquake zones because yeah

2542.099 --> 2547.0190000000002
one big earthquake and suddenly cables

2544.739 --> 2550.0190000000002
cut off but then again if you have a

2547.019 --> 2553.4689999999996
vast network with more than one

2550.019 --> 2555.1189999999997
connection in yeah like a net going

2553.469 --> 2556.349
through everything then some places may

2555.119 --> 2559.289
break and there will still be a

2556.349 --> 2560.969
connection enough to make time to fix

2559.289 --> 2563.6400000000003
one of those broken connections or

2560.969 --> 2565.14
something I dunno if if it's got to be a

2563.64 --> 2568.89
disaster area there's probably going to

2565.14 --> 2573.96
be other priorities but that seems much

2568.89 --> 2576.479
more durable to me it is extra work it

2573.96 --> 2579.18
requires the application and production

2576.479 --> 2581.21
of more material though that is true but

2579.18 --> 2584.0
come on glass fiber

2581.21 --> 2586.64
that those optics cables is that really

2584.0 --> 2590.39
is there any precious resource going

2586.64 --> 2595.5499999999997
into that no no it's not it's all super

2590.39 --> 2600.3799999999997
basic what do you need it maybe maybe

2595.55 --> 2602.3
some metal plastic and glass in a

2600.38 --> 2604.73
specific type of production and that's

2602.3 --> 2607.79
it it's super basic there's not even

2604.73 --> 2609.86
some kind of precious resource that you

2607.79 --> 2611.54
need to secure in some way in order to

2609.86 --> 2614.4700000000003
get it done like the ridiculous

2611.54 --> 2620.24
situation with it with the electric cars

2614.47 --> 2624.1099999999997
which require certain rare minerals or

2620.24 --> 2625.7299999999996
precious metals types things so yeah for

2624.11 --> 2629.53
this type of internet that's not even

2625.73 --> 2633.02
required it's so basic you just do it

2629.53 --> 2635.3300000000004
I've been trying to tell people this for

2633.02 --> 2640.34
like 20 years now like please just this

2635.33 --> 2642.79
stupid Wi-Fi [ __ ] and Bluetooth like why

2640.34 --> 2647.3900000000003
why don't we just have wires everywhere

2642.79 --> 2651.17
why you know I'm not against mobiles in

2647.39 --> 2653.72
that sense but they should not be mobile

2651.17 --> 2656.84
internet computers like that not not

2653.72 --> 2659.4399999999996
just like that not not per default I

2656.84 --> 2659.44
don't know

2668.41 --> 2672.64
but yeah maybe I'm just not maybe I'm

2671.259 --> 2674.529
just too boomer ish

2672.64 --> 2676.8089999999997
I still got caught up on the mobile

2674.529 --> 2680.97
revolution I just never liked the

2676.809 --> 2683.65
wireless systems I never really did I

2680.97 --> 2686.339
love the Internet I just don't like

2683.65 --> 2686.339
wireless

2702.21 --> 2705.2690000000002
[Music]

2719.24 --> 2728.0
well Gideon's sick look the idea of 5g

2724.97 --> 2733.14
specific that satellites makes no sense

2728.0 --> 2735.36
indeed because it's a short-range thing

2733.14 --> 2737.8199999999997
so what are they gonna amplify it up

2735.36 --> 2740.01
like a thousandfold and literally fry

2737.82 --> 2742.8300000000004
everything just to reach that for now

2740.01 --> 2747.96
that doesn't make any sense that's why

2742.83 --> 2750.2999999999997
they use that the the local transmission

2747.96 --> 2753.63
system it's got to be local because it

2750.3 --> 2757.5
doesn't reach too far on the satellites

2753.63 --> 2759.1800000000003
not gonna work or SATA lune or whatever

2757.5 --> 2762.09
it's not gonna work

2759.18 --> 2765.3799999999997
a giant radio tower like set up it won't

2762.09 --> 2765.38
work for five years well

2774.34 --> 2778.6800000000003
Oh God yeah 101 rock hard is

2789.92 --> 2793.079
[Music]

2795.16 --> 2798.6299999999997
[Music]

2810.93 --> 2816.43
right anyway you know what we should

2814.27 --> 2819.79
talk about Flat Earth more often

2816.43 --> 2822.609
all this 5g and Corona yeah I know it is

2819.79 --> 2825.55
now I just I kind of want to warn you

2822.609 --> 2829.0299999999997
guys okay in a way it's and it's a

2825.55 --> 2833.29
warning to myself as well it's you gotta

2829.03 --> 2835.69
be careful when something we've dealt

2833.29 --> 2837.55
with and we figure it out because people

2835.69 --> 2840.58
have kind of sort of figured this out

2837.55 --> 2844.15
for a while even the five G like Flat

2840.58 --> 2849.46
Earth in general has been keeping an eye

2844.15 --> 2851.17
and talking about five G four years from

2849.46 --> 2853.42
the start where it was always like one

2851.17 --> 2858.099
of those things that was like we have to

2853.42 --> 2861.91
be careful with that and now that

2858.099 --> 2863.8
suddenly all this information and

2861.91 --> 2865.96
concerning current that it's kind of

2863.8 --> 2868.4500000000003
getting very strongly in the sub

2865.96 --> 2872.89
mainstream that's a risk because that

2868.45 --> 2876.49
means that grab lers are gonna try to

2872.89 --> 2879.3689999999997
derail it try to muddy the water poison

2876.49 --> 2882.3689999999997
the well of that batch of information

2879.369 --> 2886.8900000000003
somehow it's what they always try so you

2882.369 --> 2889.2400000000002
gotta be careful not to get caught up in

2886.89 --> 2892.5699999999997
obsession over those two subjects

2889.24 --> 2894.609
specifically and just scour around for

2892.57 --> 2897.369
more info concerning that you've gotta

2894.609 --> 2899.589
be very careful not to spiral out of

2897.369 --> 2905.44
control because it's getting more

2899.589 --> 2909.04
attention keep your wits don't get over

2905.44 --> 2913.42
enthusiastic because it seems like there

2909.04 --> 2914.64
is progress in some way pay people be

2913.42 --> 2918.359
careful

2914.64 --> 2918.359
keep your wits about

2921.44 --> 2928.069
so anyway any anyone up for any flat

2925.319 --> 2928.069
earth issue

2935.56 --> 2939.87
protected us sure

2950.4 --> 2956.9700000000003
I don't know dank look I don't know how

2954.66 --> 2960.6
scenarios exactly like that will unfold

2956.97 --> 2963.39
when there's yeah when I don't know I

2960.6 --> 2966.7799999999997
you could say that vandalism starts to

2963.39 --> 2972.5099999999998
happen against the system for example I

2966.78 --> 2975.75
don't know exactly it all depends on if

2972.51 --> 2977.7900000000004
the police are even willing to really go

2975.75 --> 2979.71
along with it or that they're just been

2977.79 --> 2982.2
designated a function that they have to

2979.71 --> 2983.31
perform whether they agree to what is

2982.2 --> 2986.85
going on or not

2983.31 --> 2988.98
it really all depends you know some of

2986.85 --> 2991.23
those cops that are part of that they

2988.98 --> 2994.05
may be just full in and they're there

2991.23 --> 2995.61
Jared just there to create 90-84 and

2994.05 --> 2998.6400000000003
they don't give a [ __ ] about anyone and

2995.61 --> 3002.33
they're masking it but that doesn't mean

2998.64 --> 3007.25
that all of these officers and all that

3002.33 --> 3010.52
are part of that so I wonder if the

3007.25 --> 3012.59
people will just if they will remain

3010.52 --> 3016.55
relatively unobstructed when they do

3012.59 --> 3018.9500000000003
something about this situation because

3016.55 --> 3022.55
if it is gonna crack down really bad

3018.95 --> 3024.9199999999996
then yeah then that there's that's just

3022.55 --> 3027.5
a super heavy nightmare situation you

3024.92 --> 3030.86
know that's gonna demoralize a lot and

3027.5 --> 3033.65
it's gonna wreak havoc trust wise

3030.86 --> 3039.28
between the police and the people more

3033.65 --> 3039.28
than ever it's gonna yeah

3046.72 --> 3052.81
I know I'd go as far as to well maybe

3050.53 --> 3056.53
you should like get to know the police

3052.81 --> 3060.369
officers that are typically in your

3056.53 --> 3062.98
neighborhood like don't just stare at

3060.369 --> 3066.6400000000003
the hat and the uniform and the badge or

3062.98 --> 3069.31
something you know see who these people

3066.64 --> 3072.16
are and they may be putting on like a

3069.31 --> 3076.5099999999998
mask like professionally but you got to

3072.16 --> 3081.3399999999997
know who these people are you got to

3076.51 --> 3083.6800000000003
know what they're like what they've

3081.34 --> 3086.6800000000003
basically gotten involved with kind of

3083.68 --> 3090.94
who they know in order to size up are

3086.68 --> 3092.95
these going to be good officers that are

3090.94 --> 3095.8
really there for the people and to try

3092.95 --> 3099.0989999999997
to fix things or are they there as part

3095.8 --> 3100.51
of a power grab from the New World Order

3099.099 --> 3106.9300000000003
you got to figure it out

3100.51 --> 3110.9500000000003
I suggest that to everyone don't just

3106.93 --> 3115.3199999999997
stare blindly at a uniform see that they

3110.95 --> 3115.3199999999997
are people and figure out who they are

3116.2 --> 3119.3599999999997
[Music]

3120.23 --> 3124.63
anyway it's just a tip

3126.27 --> 3129.449
[Music]

3140.9 --> 3149.15
mr. policeman or policewoman

3179.17 --> 3182.78
[Music]

3184.07 --> 3190.88
right that's that's a good point you

3186.95 --> 3193.6699999999996
make they're more colored our color says

3190.88 --> 3196.79
there are human beings are there humans

3193.67 --> 3199.4300000000003
behind algorithms AI is not autonomous

3196.79 --> 3202.13
it needs people still algorithm is a

3199.43 --> 3205.79
scapegoat for the nasty programming

3202.13 --> 3209.15
coders for the nest programming coders

3205.79 --> 3212.69
can do let's look it removes the blame

3209.15 --> 3217.46
and puts it on the cpu kind of it is

3212.69 --> 3220.88
basically the tool it it figures out

3217.46 --> 3222.56
something and then yeah it's the people

3220.88 --> 3227.02
are the ones that are actually saying

3222.56 --> 3230.24
yes to it let's do this it's not the AI

3227.02 --> 3234.68
it just figures out like an efficient

3230.24 --> 3237.08
way to do things that's right it's the

3234.68 --> 3241.91
people it's the people that make the

3237.08 --> 3245.0299999999997
decision that that are probably drunk on

3241.91 --> 3248.18
the power that they perceive is being

3245.03 --> 3251.7200000000003
given to them without realizing the

3248.18 --> 3255.44
consequences of doing that on the long

3251.72 --> 3256.97
run or maybe they do and they're just

3255.44 --> 3259.76
freaking evil

3256.97 --> 3264.7599999999998
yeah doubling down until the end you

3259.76 --> 3264.76
don't know until it happens

3270.4 --> 3273.4790000000003
[Music]

3304.69 --> 3309.58
numbers don't mean much against

3307.42 --> 3311.14
technology that's how you can manage to

3309.58 --> 3316.15
conquer one-fourth of the world

3311.14 --> 3320.3199999999997
oh really Paul fonox no no no no you got

3316.15 --> 3324.7000000000003
a wrong buddy you got it so wrong so

3320.32 --> 3327.79
wrong no no no no no the UK managed to

3324.7 --> 3330.1499999999996
conquer one-fourth of the world because

3327.79 --> 3333.34
of Technology you know what technology

3330.15 --> 3337.39
ship faring technology you know which

3333.34 --> 3339.31
technology they rely nutrition nutrition

3337.39 --> 3343.0299999999997
and maintenance because they figured out

3339.31 --> 3345.49
lemons they figured out lemons in a time

3343.03 --> 3348.8700000000003
when subtly trade options were there and

3345.49 --> 3353.35
nobody really knew it not really

3348.87 --> 3355.5699999999997
they yeah people that went on ships for

3353.35 --> 3357.7
long journeys were just expected to die

3355.57 --> 3359.32
and was just a risk most of them were

3357.7 --> 3361.99
willing to take indentured servants and

3359.32 --> 3365.17
all no other way out and then the Brits

3361.99 --> 3368.5899999999997
figured out wait if you just give them

3365.17 --> 3371.83
lemons they don't need much else and

3368.59 --> 3378.04
they will not get scurvy and then

3371.83 --> 3381.61
suddenly instead of yeah having all your

3378.04 --> 3384.49
shipmates die after half a year's travel

3381.61 --> 3388.78
non-stop suddenly you can go for two

3384.49 --> 3391.3599999999997
years I maybe it's not I don't know but

3388.78 --> 3396.4
as an example you know so it was

3391.36 --> 3399.58
actually technology it was actually

3396.4 --> 3401.53
technology that that allowed the Brits

3399.58 --> 3404.22
to conquer a quarter of the world

3401.53 --> 3404.2200000000003
Pauling's

3406.89 --> 3409.949
[Music]

3415.43 --> 3427.19
oh well yeah technology yeah I guess

3423.02 --> 3428.92
that nutrition food awareness

3427.19 --> 3434.26
maintenance it does fall under

3428.92 --> 3438.039
technology it's like yeah sort of

3434.26 --> 3442.01
of course the literal source is nature

3438.039 --> 3445.1490000000003
but yeah you'd have to figure that out

3442.01 --> 3445.1490000000003
[Music]

3450.23 --> 3456.27
yeah but that's yeah exactly numerically

3453.78 --> 3458.9
inferior that's what you say right well

3456.27 --> 3462.42
the whole thing is well if suddenly

3458.9 --> 3464.55
nobody or barely anybody on ships

3462.42 --> 3467.85
traveling long distances died anymore

3464.55 --> 3472.38
well guess what now suddenly that little

3467.85 --> 3474.2999999999997
amount of population goes much much

3472.38 --> 3476.79
further much much further because

3474.3 --> 3478.8300000000004
they'll barely nobody dies and they

3476.79 --> 3482.04
build up more and more experience as

3478.83 --> 3485.67
they don't die as well so they become

3482.04 --> 3487.98
more apt seafarers they know the routes

3485.67 --> 3489.75
better they know the obstacles better so

3487.98 --> 3493.38
all of them become better yeah that's

3489.75 --> 3496.28
exactly how that works not dying is a

3493.38 --> 3496.28
great advantage

3523.08 --> 3530.5299999999997
okay Jeff rebellion I get it you don't

3526.72 --> 3533.1299999999997
have to copy paste that every day but

3530.53 --> 3533.13
yeah

3554.91 --> 3561.6189999999997
okay gaining wisdom what are you talking

3558.48 --> 3561.619
about that sounds interesting

3592.59 --> 3600.02
- I fish Ren are you asking me no I

3597.27 --> 3600.02
don't

3604.9 --> 3612.79
like I wouldn't fish unless unless it

3610.03 --> 3616.9
was to eat and I wouldn't eat fish here

3612.79 --> 3621.31
at this moment like in the river here I

3616.9 --> 3624.34
don't think that's really that safe but

3621.31 --> 3630.07
I ya know my dad's been more of a Fisher

3624.34 --> 3635.02
he likes fishing I me yeah just I get

3630.07 --> 3636.9100000000003
kind of bored quickly maybe now that I'm

3635.02 --> 3638.2599999999998
older I might actually appreciate it

3636.91 --> 3642.58
more especially if the weather was great

3638.26 --> 3644.86
you know but I don't know if that I've

3642.58 --> 3646.9
never really engaged in fishing like I

3644.86 --> 3647.4700000000003
maybe tried it once with my dad that's

3646.9 --> 3650.7400000000002
it

3647.47 --> 3652.06
never really appealed to me I just

3650.74 --> 3654.24
thought it was kind of cruel for the

3652.06 --> 3657.22
fish I did however as a kid go out

3654.24 --> 3660.2799999999997
snorkeling and then using a harpoon to

3657.22 --> 3663.91
shoot a fish and then my parents ate

3660.28 --> 3666.13
that fish on the barbecue at the camping

3663.91 --> 3668.47
later that evening and that I didn't eat

3666.13 --> 3672.34
of it because I actually had a big guilt

3668.47 --> 3676.3599999999997
trip over it felt terrible from seeing

3672.34 --> 3679.33
that that blissful fishy just sadly yeah

3676.36 --> 3684.1600000000003
completely panic death squirt and know

3679.33 --> 3685.75
that just I I did not expect to be so

3684.16 --> 3688.66
shocked by that as a little kid but I

3685.75 --> 3691.42
was and after that I kind of never ate

3688.66 --> 3693.91
fish again I don't eat fish I take fish

3691.42 --> 3696.36
oil for health reasons but I don't need

3693.91 --> 3696.3599999999997
it anymore

3719.13 --> 3732.7490000000003
okay 101 rock on if you say so well the

3727.229 --> 3735.749
thing is in a sense you know it would be

3732.749 --> 3737.5789999999997
maybe interesting too I know if they how

3735.749 --> 3740.3999999999996
that would even work but to like make my

3737.579 --> 3744.3590000000004
own fish oil maybe I can't catch wild

3740.4 --> 3746.069
fish that are pretty reliable and then

3744.359 --> 3747.989
make fish oil out of them and I don't

3746.069 --> 3755.7
know give their a stick to cats or

3747.989 --> 3758.729
something because not just to try it out

3755.7 --> 3763.7
like they're really super fresh fish or

3758.729 --> 3768.1499999999996
I wonder what that would do to my system

3763.7 --> 3777.6189999999997
how far from the ocean am I uh I don't

3768.15 --> 3777.619
know the Netherlands well what can it be

3778.729 --> 3786.6899999999996
like a hundred miles maybe something

3782.009 --> 3789.569
like that maybe more I don't know look

3786.69 --> 3792.349
it up on a map I mean Utrecht it's like

3789.569 --> 3797.45
in dead center of the Netherlands and

3792.349 --> 3797.4500000000003
yeah measure it from there to the coast

3811.119 --> 3814.7490000000003
yeah Jeffrey Bell well that would be

3813.309 --> 3824.0190000000002
interesting indeed

3814.749 --> 3825.759
but yeah to oil tankers might be a

3824.019 --> 3828.7889999999998
little difficult to arrange something

3825.759 --> 3830.979
like that create oil

3828.789 --> 3834.369
yeah writing Ryanair something yes I

3830.979 --> 3838.5389999999998
know I have tried krill oil and it's

3834.369 --> 3840.88
it's been a very good experience but

3838.539 --> 3847.539
yeah it's not something I'm gonna

3840.88 --> 3851.46
personally catch I guess but krill oil

3847.539 --> 3851.46
is pretty amazing I agree

3882.69 --> 3893.04
okay nice people are having a picnic

3890.7 --> 3898.3399999999997
over there in the grass yeah it is

3893.04 --> 3898.34
perfect weather that mm-hmm

3922.09 --> 3924.84
hmm

3941.61 --> 3944.679
[Music]

3956.63 --> 3963.65
oh by the way yeah I get kind of that's

3960.5 --> 3966.67
a tip from Rasta get a new supplement

3963.65 --> 3968.6
awaits no here I've got some k2

3966.67 --> 3975.55
apparently that works really well

3968.6 --> 3975.5499999999997
combined with combined with d3 and yes

3976.81 --> 3983.17
it feels quite good it's never I never

3980.54 --> 3983.17
tried that before

3986.51 --> 3992.75
mmm getting sick any clue as to what's

3989.75 --> 3995.65
keeping gas pressure in yeah I pretty

3992.75 --> 3995.65
sure it's a container

4012.699 --> 4015.699
nootropics

4018.0 --> 4029.18
I mean neutralist with EU right yeah and

4023.19 --> 4034.349
well sort of I have tried some of it

4029.18 --> 4036.45
it's I don't know I I'm always very

4034.349 --> 4039.69
careful with that stuff you know I have

4036.45 --> 4044.0299999999997
enough nootropics right there in my head

4039.69 --> 4044.03
just just be me

4055.07 --> 4059.9900000000002
I don't know Paul Phoenix I don't know

4057.47 --> 4064.31
what the altitude of the container is or

4059.99 --> 4067.3399999999997
where it is at I don't even know if if

4064.31 --> 4070.64
we can get there or if there's something

4067.34 --> 4075.73
else in between like a magnetic barrier

4070.64 --> 4075.73
or something something like that

4085.519 --> 4099.079
a container of what material gasps well

4096.13 --> 4108.109
no I don't think that's even I think it

4099.079 --> 4111.049
could simply be an end of space it would

4108.109 --> 4114.5
simply be where yeah material simply

4111.049 --> 4116.869
cannot go at after our act at a certain

4114.5 --> 4120.71
point it just can't go any further so it

4116.869 --> 4122.63
would just be yeah a natural a spatial

4120.71 --> 4125.719
barrier it wouldn't be a bad and barrier

4122.63 --> 4128.650000000001
made of matter it would simply there

4125.719 --> 4131.75
would simply be no more space like that

4128.65 --> 4134.138999999999
could be it could be doesn't have to be

4131.75 --> 4134.139
like that

4168.33 --> 4172.98
nothing beyond then you have to turn

4171.089 --> 4175.13
inside out what what are you talking

4172.98 --> 4175.129999999999
about

4183.509 --> 4192.87
well Shawn Smith you know what Atmos

4186.299 --> 4196.23
means right it means gas so it's just

4192.87 --> 4199.3099999999995
another word for effectively the same

4196.23 --> 4202.889999999999
thing but with with a glow

4199.31 --> 4205.650000000001
presupposition connotation in it with an

4202.89 --> 4208.530000000001
angle to it but it is technically just

4205.65 --> 4212.929999999999
gas pressure so there is no difference

4208.53 --> 4212.929999999999
between air and the atmosphere

4253.48 --> 4258.669999999999
well we have rakia life who knows you

4256.6 --> 4262.410000000001
know that's been for that I concept has

4258.67 --> 4266.83
been forwarded before that the earth is

4262.41 --> 4269.62
in a sphere and it is not geometrically

4266.83 --> 4273.79
oriented in any spherical way it is

4269.62 --> 4277.48
simply a bubble and in it it's divided

4273.79 --> 4278.53
the earth and the air and that's inside

4277.48 --> 4280.54
of a bubble

4278.53 --> 4283.84
yeah that's an idea it's a concept

4280.54 --> 4287.92
though you know a concept that it's no

4283.84 --> 4291.63
empirical backing because yeah where is

4287.92 --> 4297.27
the sphere where is the geometry of that

4291.63 --> 4297.27
sphere in which we are contained then

4297.36 --> 4307.54
you know I don't feel it is a sphere in

4302.83 --> 4309.94
which we are I really don't I think it's

4307.54 --> 4312.13
a square I don't think it's a sphere I

4309.94 --> 4314.469999999999
think it's a freaking square rather than

4312.13 --> 4317.53
it's much more likely to be a square or

4314.47 --> 4320.860000000001
a rectangular or whatever some weird

4317.53 --> 4324.73
irregular thing maybe it's like a weird

4320.86 --> 4327.299999999999
loopy blob thing that changes and shifts

4324.73 --> 4334.75
its speciality I don't know man

4327.3 --> 4335.9800000000005
pretty sure it's not a sphere it's it's

4334.75 --> 4341.23
too spherical

4335.98 --> 4343.919999999999
that seems to ball ball arish to atomic

4341.23 --> 4343.919999999999
thinking

4344.83 --> 4349.62
[Music]

4347.06 --> 4352.17
right yeah when I was talking about the

4349.62 --> 4354.18
whole weird loopy thingy that is the

4352.17 --> 4357.74
spatial confined of the realm the earth

4354.18 --> 4360.81
in inside of it is flat and

4357.74 --> 4363.86
geometrically oriented to be flat that's

4360.81 --> 4367.2300000000005
right that's not gonna change about it

4363.86 --> 4370.23
they're simply referring to the overall

4367.23 --> 4373.32
confine of the realm the spatial confine

4370.23 --> 4375.54
and it's dimensions I don't think it's a

4373.32 --> 4381.799999999999
sphere I don't think we are inside a

4375.54 --> 4381.8
spatial sphere but yeah

4394.409 --> 4401.79
okay well that's really nice that you

4396.63 --> 4406.17
seem to know this now recchia life you

4401.79 --> 4409.62
just said it it's like yeah a huge

4406.17 --> 4412.56
bubble but how do you know you know it's

4409.62 --> 4418.61
a it's a presupposition just like disk

4412.56 --> 4418.610000000001
earth you don't know that

4432.47 --> 4441.17
well you might not know but now we don't

4436.25 --> 4446.86
know okay right it's not that we might

4441.17 --> 4446.86
not know we don't know I want to know

4453.9 --> 4461.3099999999995
so I was just wondering you know what

4458.659 --> 4466.7699999999995
what if in some way you get an

4461.31 --> 4469.29
opportunity to really figure it out or

4466.77 --> 4471.75
at least think you have the opportunity

4469.29 --> 4474.2699999999995
to really figure it out and then you

4471.75 --> 4476.4
figure out well that it's more in the

4474.27 --> 4478.35
direction of what our win over here has

4476.4 --> 4481.86
been saying namely that the earth is

4478.35 --> 4484.8
freakin surreal and that things just

4481.86 --> 4488.009999999999
become too freakin complicated like

4484.8 --> 4491.219
literally too complicated to put it

4488.01 --> 4493.71
together what what then will you still

4491.219 --> 4498.84
want to know when you can't put it

4493.71 --> 4502.05
together when you can't when you can't

4498.84 --> 4504.51
fix it and you can't really get the

4502.05 --> 4509.4800000000005
answer because it doesn't work in your

4504.51 --> 4509.4800000000005
mind will you still continue then

4522.019 --> 4528.360000000001
so it doesn't have to be outside of our

4524.789 --> 4531.21
understanding it just may be that it

4528.36 --> 4533.719
takes a lot more effort to understand it

4531.21 --> 4537.21
or even get closer to any understanding

4533.719 --> 4540.059
then most people may find were it worth

4537.21 --> 4543.32
it may simply be too much if a mind

4540.059 --> 4545.999
cruncher it's like no it's not worth it

4543.32 --> 4550.94
once you really figure out what its

4545.999 --> 4550.94
gonna cost you to figure it out you know

4552.86 --> 4561.179
yeah it sounds a little pessimist I

4555.719 --> 4563.94
guess but I'm just saying everybody's

4561.179 --> 4565.53
always as a human trait just having

4563.94 --> 4570.089999999999
these tendencies to just take a

4565.53 --> 4574.199
simplified version a model a view and

4570.09 --> 4578.34
just stick to that because it is easier

4574.199 --> 4583.199
to uphold in your mind but reality may

4578.34 --> 4587.28
simply not abide by our will concerning

4583.199 --> 4590.759999999999
that it may simply not reveal itself to

4587.28 --> 4592.86
be able to be implemented like that in

4590.76 --> 4596.13
your mind with relative ease it may

4592.86 --> 4599.489
simply not be possible you know and my

4596.13 --> 4602.61
rectangular looping realm concept is

4599.489 --> 4607.098999999999
already one step in that direction it's

4602.61 --> 4612.268999999999
basically saying yeah it's like this and

4607.099 --> 4614.579
these loop and yeah I guess probably

4612.269 --> 4616.4400000000005
most people in chat get that they can

4614.579 --> 4619.86
visualize it well guess what there's

4616.44 --> 4623.428999999999
people out there they just can't they

4619.86 --> 4627.839999999999
just can't do it they can't say to

4623.429 --> 4629.82
themselves this could be a model of

4627.84 --> 4635.059
reality they just can't do it they can't

4629.82 --> 4635.058999999999
it doesn't allow them it makes them one

4637.909 --> 4645.299999999999
yeah

4639.78 --> 4648.15
so maybe my rectangular looping system

4645.3 --> 4649.650000000001
is even an oversimplification I already

4648.15 --> 4653.57
kind of pointed it out what if it's

4649.65 --> 4656.638999999999
completely irregular looping like the

4653.57 --> 4658.889
spaciality called fine is all over the

4656.639 --> 4662.900000000001
place and maybe even changing and it's

4658.889 --> 4665.76
getting really freaky who knows well

4662.9 --> 4670.138999999999
just to conceptualize that to me is

4665.76 --> 4672.92
already kind of difficult it's like if

4670.139 --> 4676.6990000000005
there's an irregular looping connection

4672.92 --> 4679.9490000000005
then how would you experience

4676.699 --> 4682.949
transversing irregular loop connection

4679.949 --> 4685.138999999999
situation how would that be experience

4682.949 --> 4688.5199999999995
it fascinates me to think about it's

4685.139 --> 4690.96
like you're going it's all flat but

4688.52 --> 4693.09
there's something odd about the region

4690.96 --> 4697.679
because there is an irregular looping

4693.09 --> 4702.329
connection so it's like you go somewhere

4697.679 --> 4704.9400000000005
and then you end up where for example

4702.329 --> 4708.469
just a little notch to the right or the

4704.94 --> 4712.428999999999
left may help you end up a hundred miles

4708.469 --> 4715.079
further away over just a short span like

4712.429 --> 4717.389
you travel maybe one kilometer and

4715.079 --> 4721.23
suddenly because you're not just likely

4717.389 --> 4725.52
to left you end up a hundred miles more

4721.23 --> 4727.619
to the left after one mile in relation

4725.52 --> 4732.2390000000005
to where you are now something like that

4727.619 --> 4738.9
like and it's all flat yeah gets really

4732.239 --> 4742.11
surreal but it is fascinating to me yeah

4738.9 --> 4749.009999999999
I guess you could categorize this sort

4742.11 --> 4752.79
of thing under planar mechanics and it

4749.01 --> 4757.4400000000005
is an interesting tool and conception

4752.79 --> 4761.1
for me to dig into also for my game for

4757.44 --> 4765.62
for the D&D game of which I designed the

4761.1 --> 4765.620000000001
realm and have options with so

4775.52 --> 4784.1
all right but anyway before we get to

4780.94 --> 4786.799999999999
figuring out the nitty-gritty details of

4784.1 --> 4791.51
any potential irregular loop concerning

4786.8 --> 4794.21
the realms confined first first things

4791.51 --> 4799.42
first we have to establish what the

4794.21 --> 4803.66
exact measured orientation of the

4799.42 --> 4806.93
Equator is which is specifically the

4803.66 --> 4810.23
yeah the Sun the Sun relation to the

4806.93 --> 4813.17
land we need to know the orientation of

4810.23 --> 4817.4
that celestial orientation we need to

4813.17 --> 4820.67
know that the geometrical measured

4817.4 --> 4823.879999999999
literal directions we need to see

4820.67 --> 4829.1900000000005
whether if it is a straight line an arc

4823.88 --> 4833.42
or a full circle and then from that

4829.19 --> 4836.2699999999995
point on there's so much like the

4833.42 --> 4838.52
options for what the realm can be once

4836.27 --> 4840.68
this is perfectly established narrows

4838.52 --> 4843.89
down a great deal and then there will be

4840.68 --> 4848.06
no recourse after that point once that

4843.89 --> 4850.9400000000005
data is truly cleared up the

4848.06 --> 4853.88
presuppositions narrow down and the

4850.94 --> 4859.389999999999
options become more set and it could go

4853.88 --> 4863.62
either way it's straight line arc circle

4859.39 --> 4868.33
which is it going to be the entire

4863.62 --> 4868.33
cosmogony options depend on this

4893.86 --> 4905.759999999999
Dutch teaching channel I could

4899.23 --> 4905.759999999999
potentially teach a person Dutch but I

4906.45 --> 4910.42
don't know they'd have to be very

4908.65 --> 4911.0199999999995
serious about it because Dutch is not

4910.42 --> 4915.0
easy

4911.02 --> 4918.01
they're just gonna slack it then yeah

4915.0 --> 4921.54
I'm gonna waste energy of that but they

4918.01 --> 4921.54
didn't really have to want to learn it

4931.969 --> 4937.9
yeah because I will probably work the

4935.09 --> 4940.43
most on prenup pronunciation because

4937.9 --> 4942.65
pronunciation means everything to a

4940.43 --> 4944.900000000001
language I've noticed that more and more

4942.65 --> 4948.62
once you really start to focus on

4944.9 --> 4951.5
correct pronunciation all their things

4948.62 --> 4955.34
and problems and development issues as

4951.5 --> 4956.92
you learn will also start to clear up to

4955.34 --> 4960.5
you more

4956.92 --> 4963.88
so pronunciation is critical to getting

4960.5 --> 4968.239
a intuitive understanding of a language

4963.88 --> 4970.400000000001
that's why I've been taught a great deal

4968.239 --> 4972.589999999999
by my parents they will oh they would

4970.4 --> 4976.339999999999
always push me to pronunciate it correct

4972.59 --> 4981.71
and did that by example and to make me

4976.34 --> 4985.31
get it right although they did that

4981.71 --> 4988.88
mostly with the Dutch and so my Dutch is

4985.31 --> 4991.64
pretty clear I don't mumble when I speak

4988.88 --> 4994.01
Dutch at all very clearly pronounced

4991.64 --> 4996.9490000000005
even though I don't try to overdo it

4994.01 --> 4999.05
it's just it happened probably because

4996.949 --> 5000.429999999999
of what my parents did but I naturally

4999.05 --> 5004.42
try to do my best

5000.43 --> 5005.71
also with English but sometimes it's a

5004.42 --> 5009.4890000000005
little bit more difficult and then I

5005.71 --> 5012.39
start to mumble slightly or mispronounce

5009.489 --> 5012.389999999999
yet it's annoying

5021.3 --> 5024.110000000001
hmm

5024.4 --> 5029.629999999999
all right anyway I think I'm gonna round

5026.9 --> 5036.129999999999
out the show getting kind of hungry

5029.63 --> 5036.13

5040.31 --> 5046.7300000000005

5044.42 --> 5049.7300000000005
