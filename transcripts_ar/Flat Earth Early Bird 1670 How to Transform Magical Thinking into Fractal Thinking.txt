7.99 --> 37.88
[Music]

55.34 --> 60.260000000000005

the support so please keep it coming

88.68 --> 94.68
right so whether today

92.46 --> 96.479
it cleared up a bit it was actually kind

94.68 --> 97.92
of nice and sunny now there's a cloud

96.479 --> 100.46
over

97.92 --> 103.799
moving over it has not been rain

100.46 --> 106.74
isn't still there but a little bit less

103.799 --> 109.43900000000001
I actually went out for groceries

106.74 --> 112.15899999999999
part of the reason why it was so late I

109.439 --> 112.15899999999999
am so late

112.619 --> 116.46
so

114.42 --> 118.5
but yeah weather is actually kind of

116.46 --> 121.5
beautiful

118.5 --> 125.299
thing is really green the grass mower

121.5 --> 125.299
machine came by this morning

126.32 --> 131.459
grass is looking like really green

129.86 --> 134.22000000000003
[Music]

131.459 --> 137.78
and yeah so is

134.22 --> 137.78
so is my parsley plant

139.76 --> 146.7
like it's doing really good like the

143.0 --> 148.8
while grow I've been using it on the

146.7 --> 151.01999999999998
parsley the most and it's like really

148.8 --> 152.52
having a big effect like the stocks are

151.02 --> 155.78
really strong

152.52 --> 155.78
so anyway

156.36 --> 160.31900000000002
low fluffy snow first in chat good to

159.36 --> 166.31900000000002
see you

160.319 --> 166.319
it is Monday the 24th of July 2023

166.8 --> 172.14000000000001
today is going to be

169.44 --> 175.04
a short show unless Nathan is not doing

172.14 --> 175.04
a live show

176.28 --> 180.84
because

177.599 --> 184.819
he's yeah apparently he was still he's

180.84 --> 184.81900000000002
still busy assembling his computer

185.22 --> 188.66
not this new stuff

189.319 --> 195.599
he transference paste

193.319 --> 198.35999999999999
and he's still still

195.599 --> 199.07999999999998
working it out whether he can fix it or

198.36 --> 200.81900000000002
not

199.08 --> 202.739
so yeah there might not be a live show

200.819 --> 205.07999999999998
and if there isn't then I'll just keep

202.739 --> 207.48000000000002
going and otherwise it's going to be a

205.08 --> 209.9
very short show

207.48 --> 209.89999999999998
right

211.5 --> 219.54
hello Moxie Terry 306 good to see you

216.78 --> 221.599
yeah I had a title for the show

219.54 --> 224.7
actually

221.599 --> 226.67999999999998
ahead of time not sure if it's going to

224.7 --> 229.01899999999998
be today's

226.68 --> 232.64000000000001
show subject

229.019 --> 232.64000000000001
try but it is like

232.86 --> 239.4
a good concept to talk about

237.18 --> 240.959
how to transform magical thinking into

239.4 --> 244.14000000000001
fractal thinking

240.959 --> 246.06
because I used to magical think a lot

244.14 --> 247.92
and it got me into trouble eventually

246.06 --> 250.2
even

247.92 --> 252.73899999999998
big trouble

250.2 --> 252.73899999999998
but

252.84 --> 260.88
magical thinking to me was basically a

257.82 --> 262.019
training wheel bike for actual fractal

260.88 --> 263.88
thinking

262.019 --> 265.86
I thought it was already fractal

263.88 --> 268.86
thinking when I was magical thinking

265.86 --> 271.32
except I didn't have all the data I just

268.86 --> 273.68
had very very strong suspicions about

271.32 --> 273.68
things

274.139 --> 279.12
about patterns

276.66 --> 282.54
I just didn't have enough data to

279.12 --> 285.419
actually really clarify the patterns

282.54 --> 287.639
so it it turned into magical thinking

285.419 --> 290.69899999999996
and the problem the biggest problem with

287.639 --> 294.259
magical thinking was is that

290.699 --> 294.259
you're very influenceable

295.86 --> 299.6
because people can suggest

299.94 --> 305.759
complex things

302.28 --> 309.85999999999996
and then you don't know whether it is

305.759 --> 309.86
actually possibly real or not

310.44 --> 316.74
now if somebody would say those types of

313.08 --> 319.38
things that were told to me 20 and 30

316.74 --> 321.66
years ago now I would literally

319.38 --> 323.639
recognize exactly where their train of

321.66 --> 326.0
thought is coming from

323.639 --> 329.039
I would even be able to very accurately

326.0 --> 331.199
Define their motivation behind the

329.039 --> 336.08
communication

331.199 --> 336.08000000000004
and thus actually be able to understand

338.18 --> 342.90000000000003
while back then I didn't

340.86 --> 344.039
so I was continually being presented

342.9 --> 347.75899999999996
with

344.039 --> 349.38
complex puzzles but I wasn't able to

347.759 --> 351.96000000000004
know

349.38 --> 355.02
how much of it was real or not

351.96 --> 356.88
and how to decide upon what is real or

355.02 --> 359.88
not that was really where the magical

356.88 --> 361.62
thinking process came into being

359.88 --> 362.84
because you don't know you have to

361.62 --> 364.56
choose something

362.84 --> 366.84
[Music]

364.56 --> 369.96
when you don't know yet

366.84 --> 374.69899999999996
right so technically

369.96 --> 380.15999999999997
magical thinking to me was like a

374.699 --> 382.199
a early boot up a or a prototype you

380.16 --> 384.97900000000004
could say it was like a prototype of

382.199 --> 384.979
fractal thinking

385.08 --> 391.19899999999996
it's just there wasn't enough there was

387.9 --> 394.02
enough data gathered for me to realize

391.199 --> 396.06
that there was the pattern

394.02 --> 397.44
which is what I call it it's even like

396.06 --> 399.84
on my

397.44 --> 403.139
on my website symbolic son and I was a

399.84 --> 405.78
prominent thing is the pattern

403.139 --> 408.72
the pattern is really the reason for

405.78 --> 412.38
fractal thinking so I knew it was there

408.72 --> 415.97900000000004
I just didn't have enough data or enough

412.38 --> 418.319
wisdom cross-referencing information

415.979 --> 420.59999999999997
to really know what is what

418.319 --> 422.1
and thus I ended up magical thinking a

420.6 --> 426.18
lot

422.1 --> 429.72
like about relatively important things

426.18 --> 432.68
and moral things even and and yeah

429.72 --> 432.68
hazardous

436.5 --> 439.1
anyway

440.52 --> 444.0
that is pretty much the the idea about

443.16 --> 446.94
it

444.0 --> 448.68
behind it and I could elaborate with

446.94 --> 450.78
examples but I don't know let's see

448.68 --> 453.599
what's gonna happen in the chat well

450.78 --> 455.88
steamy traveler good to see you

453.599 --> 459.0
yesterday you listen to my show

455.88 --> 462.78
now we were talking about bullying

459.0 --> 465.3
school I caught bullying three times

462.78 --> 467.039
I'll sleep oh that sucks

465.3 --> 469.5
yeah it sucks when you're being falsely

467.039 --> 471.37
accused yeah they did that to me all the

469.5 --> 475.84
time

471.37 --> 475.84000000000003
[Music]

479.099 --> 481.099
yeah

481.68 --> 486.0
and the crazy thing was they did it so

484.199 --> 487.56
many times to me that eventually I

486.0 --> 488.4
started to believe it

487.56 --> 489.72
really

488.4 --> 492.19899999999996
[Music]

489.72 --> 492.199
because

493.319 --> 498.12
yeah well it was also because of

495.36 --> 501.56
attention Addiction in a way that I had

498.12 --> 501.56
issues with off and on

501.72 --> 507.8
so if they accuse me of something I'd

503.699 --> 507.8
say yeah yeah it was me

508.02 --> 513.4789999999999
even if I didn't do it and even if it

510.66 --> 517.08
was bad this is

513.479 --> 519.0600000000001
yeah I was really kind of crazy as a kid

517.08 --> 520.74
now I'm referencing something that was

519.06 --> 523.6199999999999
really like pre-teen

520.74 --> 525.0600000000001
I was really crazy at times oh and now

523.62 --> 527.519
it's starting to rain

525.06 --> 530.04
okay that's a good thing that didn't

527.519 --> 532.94
happen while I was out for groceries

530.04 --> 532.9399999999999
in my shirt

533.72 --> 538.4590000000001
hey LSG could see you

538.56 --> 541.76
an eleanorstrand

542.7 --> 546.5400000000001
what was the gamma [ __ ] yeah there was

544.56 --> 548.9399999999999
a lot of that gamma [ __ ] around me I

546.54 --> 551.0999999999999
just that I was gamma [ __ ] were

548.94 --> 553.019
completely alien to me

551.1 --> 554.339
because we didn't have that in the

553.019 --> 557.7
family

554.339 --> 560.399
like my family we had issues but nobody

557.7 --> 562.5
was a gamma [ __ ] because that's

560.399 --> 565.62
that type of behavior would like

562.5 --> 567.06
immediately get all the elders like my

565.62 --> 569.1
older brother and

567.06 --> 571.68
all the family would immediately like

569.1 --> 573.779
hey this is you need to stop that

571.68 --> 576.779
immediately

573.779 --> 576.779
so

576.899 --> 583.2
like I never really knew about Gamma

581.1 --> 586.08
Behavior because my family literally

583.2 --> 589.08
didn't tolerate it

586.08 --> 591.1800000000001
from their own that is and if a friend

589.08 --> 593.64
came along and they turned into turned

591.18 --> 595.38
out to be a gamma [ __ ] well then we

593.64 --> 597.06
wouldn't invite them back like I

595.38 --> 598.68
wouldn't invite them back if they turned

597.06 --> 600.7199999999999
out to be kind of a gamer

598.68 --> 603.12
because they suck

600.72 --> 605.6
but I didn't yeah the school I was at

603.12 --> 609.62
was [ __ ] filled with him

605.6 --> 612.4200000000001
treacherous conniving conspiring

609.62 --> 616.44
arrogant bastards

612.42 --> 620.5999999999999
that would literally form groups

616.44 --> 620.6
in bullying and [ __ ] it was terrible

620.64 --> 625.56
and it was a mega challenge too because

623.339 --> 627.4200000000001
I didn't know what the hell that was and

625.56 --> 629.3389999999999
I had to deal with it my parents

627.42 --> 630.42
actually offered me to go to another

629.339 --> 632.339
school

630.42 --> 634.92
like

632.339 --> 636.12
after two years in total I was there

634.92 --> 638.2199999999999
three years

636.12 --> 639.48
and after two years

638.22 --> 641.64
like

639.48 --> 643.9200000000001
they offered me like you want to go to

641.64 --> 646.1999999999999
another school and I was like no

643.92 --> 649.14
no [ __ ] way didn't say it like that

646.2 --> 651.899
but like I'm I need to feel and finish

649.14 --> 655.3199999999999
this challenge I'm almost there

651.899 --> 658.74
I'm almost in control

655.32 --> 662.519
and so I went that last year anyway

658.74 --> 664.44
and to be fair also the kids that were

662.519 --> 666.839
kind of bullying me they really expected

664.44 --> 669.839
me to go away

666.839 --> 672.4200000000001
they kind of wanted to why because they

669.839 --> 676.399
were on top of all of it kind of racist

672.42 --> 679.74
too secretly and I'm not like a broken

676.399 --> 682.2
blue-eyed guy and looked a little bit

679.74 --> 685.019
like even had a little tiny bit of

682.2 --> 687.48
yellow skin more when I was young it's

685.019 --> 689.22
still in me but it's not as pretty as

687.48 --> 692.4590000000001
dominant as it was so they would be

689.22 --> 693.6600000000001
racist against me on top of it all and

692.459 --> 696.42
like

693.66 --> 698.279
I kind of had to accept that

696.42 --> 699.7199999999999
because

698.279 --> 702.8389999999999
like

699.72 --> 705.0
I even went to the teachers with that

702.839 --> 707.1
and they basically told me like yeah

705.0 --> 709.079
where

707.1 --> 711.12
you're different

709.079 --> 713.6999999999999
they need to deal with it

711.12 --> 716.339
and you need to deal with it yeah yeah

713.7 --> 718.019
that can you imagine that can you

716.339 --> 721.2600000000001
imagine

718.019 --> 724.2
can you imagine guys a teacher

721.26 --> 726.0
saying that now

724.2 --> 730.1400000000001
in this world

726.0 --> 733.44
it's like like teacher they're bullying

730.14 --> 736.86
me because because I'm Indonesian

733.44 --> 739.3800000000001
like I'm not because I'm half blood like

736.86 --> 743.12
yeah but yeah you're gonna have to deal

739.38 --> 743.12
with that and so are they

743.22 --> 747.62
like can you imagine that being said in

745.92 --> 750.959
school

747.62 --> 754.62
no no no no no no they wouldn't say that

750.959 --> 757.7399999999999
now yeah but but just remember

754.62 --> 760.079
that third year my parents offered me to

757.74 --> 761.82
get me to another school because it was

760.079 --> 763.7399999999999
really gruesome on me

761.82 --> 765.779
nightmarish sometimes

763.74 --> 769.139
but I said no

765.779 --> 772.38
don't you dare I need to finish this or

769.139 --> 775.82
I'll never or I'll be a wussy forever

772.38 --> 775.82
that's basically what I said

776.459 --> 781.56
and I succeeded because at the end of

779.04 --> 784.26
that school I was like on top of the

781.56 --> 785.6999999999999
entire situation I was very strong I had

784.26 --> 786.8389999999999
a lot of energy I was very proud of

785.7 --> 789.6600000000001
myself

786.839 --> 790.44
and I could look those bully guys in the

789.66 --> 793.26
eyes

790.44 --> 797.1600000000001
and they would feel like damn it he won

793.26 --> 801.66
yeah it was [ __ ] kick ass

797.16 --> 804.019
like the actual last few months was kick

801.66 --> 804.019
ass

805.44 --> 810.5400000000001
and a real really helpful for my

807.779 --> 814.579
transformation basically from a preteen

810.54 --> 814.579
into a an actual teenager

818.7 --> 823.44
because yeah when I was 12 I started a

821.279 --> 825.8389999999999
little late I guess a year late because

823.44 --> 827.639
I did the extra year from the Waldorf

825.839 --> 829.019
School when normally that's the first

827.639 --> 830.639
year of

829.019 --> 832.8
Middle School

830.639 --> 835.44
so I did that extra year

832.8 --> 837.66
with the Waldorf School and it was like

835.44 --> 839.5790000000001
it was worth it even though it was a

837.66 --> 841.68
year later with with other schools

839.579 --> 844.579
didn't matter because it was freaking

841.68 --> 844.579
brilliant anyway

847.079 --> 849.8599999999999
but yeah

850.079 --> 854.579
that's how it can go

853.32 --> 857.339
yeah

854.579 --> 859.7399999999999
bullying and even racism

857.339 --> 862.44
can be

859.74 --> 865.019
turned around and turned into a

862.44 --> 868.2
non-victim status type

865.019 --> 869.88
skill like you can come out of it not

868.2 --> 872.339
being a victim

869.88 --> 877.26
and not being always like oh race is

872.339 --> 877.2600000000001
risen no no never yeah

878.579 --> 884.3389999999999
it's like this now oh you want to be

881.519 --> 888.0
racist about my background that some

884.339 --> 889.86
people do actually like what's this that

888.0 --> 892.56
Charlie

889.86 --> 895.38
girl or whatever who hung around in flat

892.56 --> 897.959
side for a while she actually got their

895.38 --> 899.579
overtly racist to me calling me a peanut

897.959 --> 903.0189999999999
and [ __ ]

899.579 --> 906.12
which is like a racist phrasiology

903.019 --> 909.0
towards Indonesia's specifically in the

906.12 --> 911.22
Netherlands and she was Dutch like now I

909.0 --> 914.779
got pissed off but more for like how

911.22 --> 914.779
dare she do that just like that

915.48 --> 919.62
but

916.74 --> 924.12
if somebody gets racist to me now then

919.62 --> 926.76
it's like oh oh let me look into your

924.12 --> 929.94
genetic group yeah because I paid a lot

926.76 --> 930.72
of attention to people now I can analyze

929.94 --> 933.839
you

930.72 --> 936.62
and I can tell you what's coming what's

933.839 --> 939.4200000000001
gonna happen to you when you age further

936.62 --> 941.88
yeah I'm gonna take a look at your

939.42 --> 943.62
family and then see that you might be

941.88 --> 947.779
projecting a little because you actually

943.62 --> 947.779
feel like you're a waning White

950.279 --> 956.3389999999999
too many faxes in the family

952.92 --> 959.3389999999999
perhaps too much influence from

956.339 --> 959.339
television

960.18 --> 965.6389999999999
media propaganda but waning yeah it's

963.36 --> 967.32
like oh you're racist against me well oh

965.639 --> 970.5
no I am

967.32 --> 974.4590000000001
partially Indonesian of the very young

970.5 --> 978.48
looking long living type oh no I'm not

974.459 --> 982.38
pure white or something no oh no

978.48 --> 984.86
yeah look at you you're waning Jello

982.38 --> 984.86
pudding

987.3 --> 993.3599999999999
it's like yeah I am into Superior

989.519 --> 996.839
genetics let's compare let's compare the

993.36 --> 999.6
the traits and like family abilities

996.839 --> 1001.1600000000001
like oh how does your dad look in his

999.6 --> 1006.94
80s

1001.16 --> 1006.9399999999999
oh oh he looks like an old stiff stick

1007.16 --> 1012.259
like a stick yeah my dad looks like he's

1010.639 --> 1015.62
60.

1012.259 --> 1016.779
at worst when he's in his 80s yeah yeah

1015.62 --> 1020.36
yeah yeah yeah yeah

1016.779 --> 1022.1
oh you're a racist oh no I'm not Pure

1020.36 --> 1025.1
White oh no oh

1022.1 --> 1028.939
yeah it's like

1025.1 --> 1031.6599999999999
bring it on baby like I'm literally not

1028.939 --> 1031.66
scared of that

1031.76 --> 1035.919
and it's mostly projection like people

1034.64 --> 1039.439
that do that

1035.919 --> 1041.66
really feel like they're actually a

1039.439 --> 1044.959
weaker wide branch

1041.66 --> 1047.9
because I've had white racism like now

1044.959 --> 1050.48
out there it's actually on average more

1047.9 --> 1051.8600000000001
that it that you encounter black races

1050.48 --> 1053.48
and the black people thinking that

1051.86 --> 1056.4189999999999
whites are bad and all that [ __ ] and so

1053.48 --> 1058.64
the shot interface of the media too and

1056.419 --> 1061.88
you know how that goes but I actually

1058.64 --> 1064.64
had white racism

1061.88 --> 1067.4
against me

1064.64 --> 1071.66
and now thinking back it's almost like

1067.4 --> 1074.66
wow I feel privileged that I still have

1071.66 --> 1076.88
been able to experience that when it's

1074.66 --> 1079.46
all routed out now I have that unique

1076.88 --> 1082.7
type of actual experience of white

1079.46 --> 1085.1200000000001
racism against me yeah and guess what

1082.7 --> 1089.0800000000002
I'm not an sjw

1085.12 --> 1092.36
oh oh yes yes I'm the most [ __ ]

1089.08 --> 1095.12
anti-shaw person you'll probably ever

1092.36 --> 1097.539
meet and I've experienced white racism

1095.12 --> 1100.76
against me yeah

1097.539 --> 1103.039
whites being racist against me yes

1100.76 --> 1105.34
what are you gonna do what are you gonna

1103.039 --> 1105.34
do

1112.28 --> 1116.299
right you know what it did

1114.5 --> 1118.34
white rays and whites being racist

1116.299 --> 1121.16
against me about them being Superior

1118.34 --> 1124.4599999999998
named me not being poor pure it made me

1121.16 --> 1126.559
over achieve it made me over compensate

1124.46 --> 1130.28
it's like oh damn it I'm not fully white

1126.559 --> 1132.9189999999999
well I'll have to bring that white out

1130.28 --> 1135.08
extra I have to like really show my

1132.919 --> 1136.22
strengths and all that that's what that

1135.08 --> 1138.3799999999999
did to me

1136.22 --> 1140.419
it's like oh you're not one of the pure

1138.38 --> 1142.5200000000002
ones the special voice basically they

1140.419 --> 1144.14
were Gammas I didn't know what that was

1142.52 --> 1146.0
right

1144.14 --> 1149.6000000000001
so I was like oh I have to be even

1146.0 --> 1151.22
better even more noble and and all that

1149.6 --> 1154.1
and

1151.22 --> 1156.799
so that's what why it's being racist

1154.1 --> 1158.539
against me actually did for me it made

1156.799 --> 1160.8799999999999
me

1158.539 --> 1163.72
make more effort

1160.88 --> 1163.72
how about that

1165.84 --> 1171.4399999999998
[Music]

1167.539 --> 1174.02
what Supremacy is the worst thing ever

1171.44 --> 1177.26
yeah except for this guy who actually

1174.02 --> 1180.98
made more effort in life thanks to

1177.26 --> 1183.5
supposed white supremacy around me

1180.98 --> 1185.0
yeah and and it's not like it didn't

1183.5 --> 1186.98
went far

1185.0 --> 1187.94
like yeah they didn't kill me or

1186.98 --> 1191.6
anything

1187.94 --> 1194.3600000000001
didn't break my legs or whatever

1191.6 --> 1197.299
that [ __ ] but they did like really

1194.36 --> 1198.1999999999998
humiliate me to like spit on me in as a

1197.299 --> 1199.58
group

1198.2 --> 1202.4
like

1199.58 --> 1205.039
really [ __ ] up

1202.4 --> 1206.96
and like when I felt really bad they

1205.039 --> 1209.24
would like kick me when you're down like

1206.96 --> 1211.52
that sort of [ __ ] I this it is

1209.24 --> 1213.38
horrendous but it's the behavior that's

1211.52 --> 1215.799
horrendous

1213.38 --> 1219.0800000000002
and the nature of it

1215.799 --> 1222.82
but I went through hell with it and then

1219.08 --> 1222.82
I became really stronger

1223.22 --> 1227.9
and hey I had the choice you know I

1225.919 --> 1229.1000000000001
could have like uh I need to go to

1227.9 --> 1231.799
another school

1229.1 --> 1233.78
because they're all bullying me but then

1231.799 --> 1237.559
I probably would have been kind of an

1233.78 --> 1240.02
actual [ __ ] wussy all my life

1237.559 --> 1243.28
if I had chosen that if I chose it had

1240.02 --> 1243.28
chosen to run away from it

1243.98 --> 1246.64
thank you

1248.96 --> 1251.6200000000001
right

1253.22 --> 1257.66
I don't know why that came up by the way

1255.02 --> 1261.6399999999999
subject it's not how to transform

1257.66 --> 1261.64
magical thinking into practical thinking

1261.98 --> 1266.6200000000001
although it's the same phase

1269.0 --> 1273.02
but yeah the decor of transforming

1270.98 --> 1276.08
magical thinking into practical thinking

1273.02 --> 1278.48
is gaining wisdom but it's first make

1276.08 --> 1280.3999999999999
the decision make this and you make the

1278.48 --> 1282.08
decision young like I am going to

1280.4 --> 1284.7800000000002
[ __ ] understand it

1282.08 --> 1286.22
I have some Talent I'm gonna work on it

1284.78 --> 1287.66
just because you're like oh you're very

1286.22 --> 1289.34
bright as a kid yeah that doesn't mean

1287.66 --> 1291.8600000000001
that you're gonna be very bright your

1289.34 --> 1293.84
life it just means you got those roots

1291.86 --> 1295.4599999999998
you gotta work on it you gotta train

1293.84 --> 1300.02
them you got to keep them alive You

1295.46 --> 1302.539
Gotta Give Them bio fuel like right you

1300.02 --> 1305.539
gotta keep it going but when you're very

1302.539 --> 1308.6589999999999
young you don't have gigantic amounts of

1305.539 --> 1311.74
wisdom to reflect upon so you will end

1308.659 --> 1311.74
up magical thinking

1312.74 --> 1316.52
because

1314.24 --> 1319.1
you need to keep thinking even though

1316.52 --> 1321.9189999999999
you don't have all the data

1319.1 --> 1325.299
right anyway so

1321.919 --> 1325.2990000000002
looked it back to that

1325.64 --> 1330.2800000000002
let me get to the chat see what you guys

1327.62 --> 1330.28
are talking about

1332.539 --> 1336.86
also I have a castle that I kind of need

1335.059 --> 1338.299
to Chow Down onto because I'm really

1336.86 --> 1340.34
hungry

1338.299 --> 1342.799
at a chicken broccoli dinner yesterday

1340.34 --> 1343.6899999999998
it did really hit the spot I really

1342.799 --> 1345.5
needed that

1343.69 --> 1348.65
[Music]

1345.5 --> 1351.4
and the shower which I also needed

1348.65 --> 1353.179
[Music]

1351.4 --> 1356.02
anyways

1353.179 --> 1356.02
cheers

1374.6 --> 1379.6
hey Matthew Hall didn't see you there

1376.76 --> 1379.6
good to see you

1381.98 --> 1385.4
are looking healthy and healthy thank

1384.02 --> 1387.559
you

1385.4 --> 1389.8400000000001
well

1387.559 --> 1392.12
I should be looking happy and healthier

1389.84 --> 1396.5
because I do feel like I'm happy and

1392.12 --> 1398.78
healthier than say four years ago

1396.5 --> 1401.5
I feel I've almost come completely out

1398.78 --> 1404.8999999999999
of well the big

1401.5 --> 1409.24
hallucination inducing trauma

1404.9 --> 1409.24
that kind of happened during my breakup

1409.82 --> 1416.799
which I was still sitting with whoa rain

1413.539 --> 1416.799
Lots I love to rain

1420.14 --> 1423.919
and I feel like I'm really getting out

1422.12 --> 1426.7399999999998
of it like

1423.919 --> 1430.3400000000001
because I am also like I'm just thinking

1426.74 --> 1432.98
about girls like four years ago I wasn't

1430.34 --> 1434.9599999999998
I was thinking about being alone and

1432.98 --> 1437.74
dying an old man alone forever that's

1434.96 --> 1437.74
what you think about

1438.5 --> 1441.94
when you look at girls

1441.98 --> 1445.3600000000001
now I don't think that anymore

1446.539 --> 1452.059
no I enjoy when I see a girl

1449.78 --> 1453.1399999999999
that I just happened to look at and that

1452.059 --> 1456.1399999999999
she like

1453.14 --> 1458.6000000000001
walks away and has that look like oh

1456.14 --> 1462.5590000000002
that's an attractive man I seems to be

1458.6 --> 1465.5
interested in me like I I like that now

1462.559 --> 1468.799
I have room for that in my spirit I

1465.5 --> 1473.26
didn't have that four years ago

1468.799 --> 1473.26
man this rain is really founding

1476.659 --> 1479.919
oh just look at this

1496.34 --> 1501.4399999999998
you know it's raining hard where you can

1498.32 --> 1503.2
literally see the road reflecting the

1501.44 --> 1505.5800000000002
air

1503.2 --> 1509.98
reflecting the sky

1505.58 --> 1509.98
anyway it's raining hard

1510.919 --> 1515.659
now I feel like was a really good idea

1513.2 --> 1518.559
to go out for groceries before the show

1515.659 --> 1518.5590000000002
instead of after

1518.96 --> 1521.6200000000001
ah

1522.86 --> 1527.539
man's getting all dark

1525.679 --> 1530.659
yeah

1527.539 --> 1533.9
okay who else did I miss

1530.659 --> 1536.24
you were born in the 90s

1533.9 --> 1539.9
I would have beaten the [ __ ] out of yeah

1536.24 --> 1544.34
well turret beating

1539.9 --> 1546.0800000000002
it's a big No-No like in that Waldorf

1544.34 --> 1548.779
School they would bully they would be

1546.08 --> 1551.4189999999999
racist they would be nasty as [ __ ]

1548.779 --> 1553.46
but if you actually physically hurt

1551.419 --> 1557.179
somebody

1553.46 --> 1559.159
like be beat them or kick them that that

1557.179 --> 1561.26
got you into serious trouble like that

1559.159 --> 1563.919
would get you kicked out of school

1561.26 --> 1567.22
so they they did pretty much everything

1563.919 --> 1567.22
except that

1574.4 --> 1579.5590000000002
yeah so I if you went to a Walter school

1577.4 --> 1582.02
they went races to you you would be out

1579.559 --> 1584.779
of that school probably within a week

1582.02 --> 1587.559
if you're gonna actually beat them for

1584.779 --> 1587.559
being racist

1587.6 --> 1592.82
because you're allowed to be racist

1590.179 --> 1594.5590000000002
you're not allowed to beat people in

1592.82 --> 1596.72
those schools or at least that's what it

1594.559 --> 1599.0
used to be

1596.72 --> 1602.659
I kind of still hope it is still like

1599.0 --> 1606.32
that it's still that they haven't been

1602.659 --> 1609.3400000000001
screwed over by the sgaw machine like

1606.32 --> 1609.34
most other schools

1613.76 --> 1616.76
what

1618.799 --> 1622.96
what are you talking about

1634.82 --> 1639.9399999999998
oh is that a fighting Sports style or

1637.039 --> 1639.94
something okay

1653.9 --> 1658.7
is because of the dumb [ __ ] artery

1656.299 --> 1660.62
yeah well you that gets you kicked out

1658.7 --> 1662.799
of school too

1660.62 --> 1662.799
foreign

1662.96 --> 1667.059
you're not allowed to beat people here

1672.65 --> 1675.679
[Music]

1680.02 --> 1687.22
the only place you can beat people

1683.12 --> 1687.2199999999998
is in actual fighting scores

1707.419 --> 1712.1200000000001
who do to some people no I get that dude

1710.419 --> 1716.24
I want

1712.12 --> 1719.1399999999999
I've imagined a really brutal things

1716.24 --> 1719.14
with these kids

1723.38 --> 1727.7600000000002
I've actually like at times even

1725.659 --> 1729.919
considered that like in the second year

1727.76 --> 1731.96
at the end of it I was like so

1729.919 --> 1733.4
insidiously angry with some of these

1731.96 --> 1737.38
people that I literally started

1733.4 --> 1737.38
fantasizing on how I could kill them

1738.2 --> 1746.38
until I eventually actually had like

1741.74 --> 1746.38
halfway viable ideas on how to do that

1746.539 --> 1751.64
but then realized that I couldn't

1749.24 --> 1754.659
actually do that because then my entire

1751.64 --> 1754.659
life would be [ __ ]

1757.279 --> 1761.96
but yeah

1758.6 --> 1764.48
those guys did get to me

1761.96 --> 1768.46
and that was hell but it was a good hell

1764.48 --> 1768.46
to go through because I was still young

1769.88 --> 1775.3400000000001
and it was a protected area where if

1772.82 --> 1776.96
something goes wrong somebody doesn't

1775.34 --> 1779.559
die

1776.96 --> 1779.559
right

1780.5 --> 1785.0
because in the world out here and as

1783.32 --> 1787.039
you're an adult when you do that sort of

1785.0 --> 1789.98
[ __ ] yeah people end up like in the

1787.039 --> 1792.2
hospital which is not good

1789.98 --> 1795.38
doing it as a kid there

1792.2 --> 1798.94
was nightmarish but nobody would end up

1795.38 --> 1798.94
in the hospital you see

1800.86 --> 1805.52
beating up on people is overrated indeed

1803.84 --> 1808.4599999999998
it is

1805.52 --> 1810.82
it's not as relieving as you might think

1808.46 --> 1810.82
it is

1813.14 --> 1818.48
it all depends though if it's like a

1816.02 --> 1821.12
serious personal rivalry that's very

1818.48 --> 1823.419
long lasting then yes it typically will

1821.12 --> 1823.4189999999999
be

1823.88 --> 1829.64
it will be uh

1827.0 --> 1832.539
relieving

1829.64 --> 1835.039
all right like when a bully continually

1832.539 --> 1837.26
physically tries to assault you and then

1835.039 --> 1840.8799999999999
you beat him back right yeah that is

1837.26 --> 1840.8799999999999
very very exhilarating

1846.5 --> 1851.6
but only if it's taken you some time to

1849.679 --> 1854.38
get to that point or if you were afraid

1851.6 --> 1854.3799999999999
to strike back

1854.84 --> 1858.98
and then it's very relieving because

1856.82 --> 1861.32
you're overcoming your fear and that's

1858.98 --> 1864.76
the relief part actually beating people

1861.32 --> 1864.76
is not interesting

1864.799 --> 1869.0
it's only even appealing when they are

1867.14 --> 1871.659
your enemy because they torture you

1869.0 --> 1871.659
psychologically

1879.559 --> 1882.039
anyway

1883.399 --> 1885.58
thank you

1891.26 --> 1893.799
what

1898.299 --> 1903.46
ah thin skin that's a nice one Godzilla

1901.279 --> 1903.46
hello

1905.12 --> 1910.039
that's a really good one actually well

1908.179 --> 1912.279
done workzilla that's a that's a great

1910.039 --> 1912.279
one

1920.74 --> 1924.82
hey Richard G good to see you

1927.08 --> 1932.48
you used to do slow-mo that's it

1930.62 --> 1933.9799999999998
um yeah but then it's like dance

1932.48 --> 1936.799
fighting it's

1933.98 --> 1938.539
you're like doing it like like a movie

1936.799 --> 1940.94
right

1938.539 --> 1944.62
fake fighting yeah that's I used to do

1940.94 --> 1946.22
that too but it's like a pre-teen thing

1944.62 --> 1949.9599999999998
[Music]

1946.22 --> 1949.96
I love to to play fight

1962.539 --> 1965.26
foreign

1975.1 --> 1980.84
like a cat almost

1977.779 --> 1986.059
I would just love to like

1980.84 --> 1989.059
be like a cat and like jump people

1986.059 --> 1989.059
unexpectedly

1990.5 --> 1995.539
or suddenly like a run out of nowhere in

1992.96 --> 1998.72
a circle and then disappear again

1995.539 --> 2002.519
like a cat you know I used to do that I

1998.72 --> 2002.519
actually learned that from my cats

2003.7 --> 2007.179
because they used to do that and I

2005.5 --> 2009.159
always thought it was hysterical and

2007.179 --> 2012.76
made me like really happy so I just like

2009.159 --> 2016.2
oh I'll do that I'm just a cat

2012.76 --> 2016.2
I'm just gonna play like a cat

2019.84 --> 2024.6999999999998
and since I was naturally extremely

2022.84 --> 2029.6999999999998
flexible

2024.7 --> 2029.7
it was doable for me to emulate a cat

2033.22 --> 2039.7
and I have a like a really

2037.179 --> 2041.6200000000001
parrot-like voice too that I can emulate

2039.7 --> 2043.96
sounds when I was a little kid I could

2041.62 --> 2046.7199999999998
literally make the sound of a cricket

2043.96 --> 2048.76
that was indistinguishable from the real

2046.72 --> 2050.98
thing okay

2048.76 --> 2053.8
that's crazy

2050.98 --> 2055.06
so I could literally like play like I'm

2053.8 --> 2059.679
a cat

2055.06 --> 2062.619
and like move like a cat on four

2059.679 --> 2064.48
and sound exactly like a cat and then

2062.619 --> 2066.8790000000004
even like match

2064.48 --> 2069.099
like how they would act

2066.879 --> 2072.22
not just oh it's meow meow no no

2069.099 --> 2073.0
actually like the type of meow what they

2072.22 --> 2075.8199999999997
do

2073.0 --> 2079.56
in those situations so I would like do

2075.82 --> 2079.56
full-on cat reenactments

2081.159 --> 2086.26
because I could

2083.98 --> 2088.899
and it was funny because I eventually

2086.26 --> 2092.2200000000003
also tried to get responses out of the

2088.899 --> 2092.22
cats when doing that

2092.379 --> 2099.16
like if I could see if I could somehow

2096.52 --> 2101.28
make them believe that I'm actually a

2099.16 --> 2101.2799999999997
cat

2107.68 --> 2112.66
it didn't really work out

2110.02 --> 2114.88
but I did they did take notice of My

2112.66 --> 2117.2799999999997
Strange behavior and that it

2114.88 --> 2119.619
I could see that they were considering

2117.28 --> 2121.98
whether I was a cat or not because of my

2119.619 --> 2121.98
behavior

2126.9 --> 2131.859
seriously

2128.56 --> 2135.66
why the [ __ ] do you always have to hang

2131.859 --> 2135.66
in front of my [ __ ] face

2138.099 --> 2142.839
oh and now oh I'm getting pissed off now

2140.5 --> 2145.3
it goes away because it knows like those

2142.839 --> 2148.18
gamuts are [ __ ] those [ __ ] flies

2145.3 --> 2149.6400000000003
are gamma [ __ ] they know it they know

2148.18 --> 2152.8799999999997
it

2149.64 --> 2156.7799999999997
inside a piece of [ __ ]

2152.88 --> 2156.78
[ __ ] out of here

2156.839 --> 2160.74
[ __ ] I don't

2165.16 --> 2168.42
where the [ __ ] is he

2183.579 --> 2191.26
I hate those [ __ ] type of flowers

2187.02 --> 2193.619
it's just those types only those types

2191.26 --> 2193.619
do that

2199.24 --> 2205.24
they die like you have no life like I am

2202.96 --> 2208.42
super merciful to all kinds of insects

2205.24 --> 2211.5989999999997
including flies but those [ __ ] things

2208.42 --> 2214.599
all need to die and to be genetically

2211.599 --> 2214.599
exterminated

2219.22 --> 2225.35
heal the bug zapper

2222.82 --> 2228.2200000000003
I just use my uh

2225.35 --> 2230.68
[Music]

2228.22 --> 2233.7599999999998
this there

2230.68 --> 2233.7599999999998
works fine enough

2239.26 --> 2244.42
and I don't want like an auto bug zapper

2241.78 --> 2246.76
there's a lot of bugs that fly around in

2244.42 --> 2249.0
my room at times and I don't want to zap

2246.76 --> 2249.0
them

2254.32 --> 2261.2200000000003
like an electric fly swatter perhaps

2258.46 --> 2263.619
but uh get us yeah exactly get a spider

2261.22 --> 2266.7
I have spiders but it's not really the

2263.619 --> 2266.7000000000003
season for spiders

2267.94 --> 2274.3
I got some spiders during springtime

2271.359 --> 2275.7999999999997
but yeah I mean after the summer that's

2274.3 --> 2278.32
when the spiders come and that's when

2275.8 --> 2281.52
the Flies get the [ __ ] out

2278.32 --> 2281.52
because they'll get eaten

2281.68 --> 2284.16
right

2285.04 --> 2290.38
flies know how to get your yeah but only

2288.46 --> 2294.28
these types of flies like a stupid

2290.38 --> 2296.44
little fly is all this room but where do

2294.28 --> 2297.88
they go [ __ ] hang around right in

2296.44 --> 2301.359
front of your face

2297.88 --> 2302.7400000000002
they know they're gamma bastards they're

2301.359 --> 2305.68
trolls

2302.74 --> 2308.14
and that's why they need to die

2305.68 --> 2311.3799999999997
even though and I am not normally like

2308.14 --> 2313.5989999999997
that to any type of insect

2311.38 --> 2315.04
but those [ __ ] things they need to

2313.599 --> 2317.98
die

2315.04 --> 2320.16
no mercy

2317.98 --> 2320.16
foreign

2321.18 --> 2327.8199999999997
yeah but they're not yes I know blue

2324.339 --> 2330.4
pill and that's annoying when they do

2327.82 --> 2332.7400000000002
that but this one is wasn't even doing

2330.4 --> 2334.98
that it was just hanging in front of my

2332.74 --> 2334.9799999999996
face

2336.82 --> 2343.48
yeah flies may want to a bite of your

2340.78 --> 2345.2200000000003
salts like especially if you're out

2343.48 --> 2346.66
there on the beach yeah that's why they

2345.22 --> 2348.8799999999997
come to you they

2346.66 --> 2351.64
want some of those

2348.88 --> 2354.099
minerals

2351.64 --> 2357.16
but uh

2354.099 --> 2359.079
like yeah it's annoying but I don't want

2357.16 --> 2363.5789999999997
to kill all of those it's like not that

2359.079 --> 2365.7400000000002
like they're like never ever leaving

2363.579 --> 2369.119
like eventually you can just slap them

2365.74 --> 2369.1189999999997
out of the way and they'll piss off

2370.0 --> 2376.32
but these things like continually get

2372.339 --> 2376.32
right in front of you it's so annoying

2377.26 --> 2381.0600000000004
yeah go [ __ ] yourself [ __ ]

2394.079 --> 2400.6600000000003
homeless man's T-shirt really

2397.06 --> 2403.74
I didn't know a white T-shirt was a

2400.66 --> 2403.74
homeless man's T-shirt

2404.44 --> 2408.0
I just thought it was a white shirt

2409.54 --> 2415.3
I mean most homeless people they don't

2412.839 --> 2417.7
have white shirts for long

2415.3 --> 2421.1400000000003
because you know homeless people don't

2417.7 --> 2421.14
actually wash their clothing

2421.359 --> 2426.9
because they don't have a washing

2422.68 --> 2426.8999999999996
machine or they just don't give a [ __ ]

2429.16 --> 2433.3199999999997
but I guess that was just the fly

2433.78 --> 2439.1800000000003
the fly that I potentially squatted

2436.06 --> 2443.52
probably turned into a chat roll

2439.18 --> 2443.52
try and do the same but digitally

2445.839 --> 2450.64
fruit flies yeah fruit yeah but fruit

2448.96 --> 2451.96
flies are just they're barely even

2450.64 --> 2454.06
creatures

2451.96 --> 2455.619
like you can't blame them for flying in

2454.06 --> 2458.7999999999997
your eye

2455.619 --> 2462.28
you know I get that when I like fly or

2458.8 --> 2464.44
when fly when I go on my bike and

2462.28 --> 2467.5
sometimes there's like these clouds of

2464.44 --> 2469.3
those things yeah well that's why in

2467.5 --> 2470.98
certain places you know they hang around

2469.3 --> 2473.98
you gotta

2470.98 --> 2475.599
like put most of your hand in front of

2473.98 --> 2477.9
your face so that you don't get them in

2475.599 --> 2477.9
your eye

2485.079 --> 2489.46
where I am homeless leave dirty clothes

2487.54 --> 2492.2799999999997
all over the yuck

2489.46 --> 2495.76
I bet they do

2492.28 --> 2498.4
that's messed up by the way you got

2495.76 --> 2500.8590000000004
that you even got homeless around like

2498.4 --> 2503.56
there aren't any here

2500.859 --> 2505.66
they're they're none they're not here

2503.56 --> 2507.099
there's like a couple homeless more in

2505.66 --> 2509.3199999999997
the Inner City

2507.099 --> 2511.8590000000004
but they don't leave junk around

2509.32 --> 2511.8590000000004
everywhere

2522.46 --> 2528.04
no people that actually leave junk

2524.8 --> 2529.6600000000003
around are stupid kids teenagers they

2528.04 --> 2531.64
leave junk

2529.66 --> 2534.8799999999997
and they smash bottles in the middle of

2531.64 --> 2538.24
the street like scumbags

2534.88 --> 2540.48
like actual like I hate those [ __ ]

2538.24 --> 2540.4799999999996
kids

2541.72 --> 2545.5789999999997
most of them are probably gonna turn

2543.4 --> 2545.579
into

2546.359 --> 2550.0
criminals anyway

2548.44 --> 2551.38
because they don't give a [ __ ] about

2550.0 --> 2553.06
anything

2551.38 --> 2555.9
and there's some of that around it's

2553.06 --> 2555.9
[ __ ] annoying

2559.079 --> 2564.099
and then again

2561.82 --> 2568.13
when I was young there was plenty of

2564.099 --> 2571.329
that around too and they were even worse

2568.13 --> 2571.329
[Music]

2587.11 --> 2596.489
[Music]

2605.14 --> 2607.68
oh

2608.38 --> 2613.9
okay no fed apparently huh

2617.26 --> 2619.6800000000003
okay

2626.98 --> 2628.98
um

2649.48 --> 2656.4
right there might be fed later but

2652.3 --> 2656.4
apparently it's not working right now

2668.7 --> 2673.5989999999997
yeah

2670.42 --> 2676.1800000000003
no he just basically updated a bunch of

2673.599 --> 2677.98
things had some

2676.18 --> 2680.5
better stuff

2677.98 --> 2682.78
like cooling paste for his processor and

2680.5 --> 2685.78
all that

2682.78 --> 2689.579
and he's like installing that but it's

2685.78 --> 2689.579
not done yet apparently

2701.56 --> 2704.16
foreign

2995.8 --> 3002.099
that's just a weird ass remark

2999.4 --> 3006.1800000000003
what I mean Nathan's doing fine it's

3002.099 --> 3008.04
just it's a tinkerer that's what you get

3006.18 --> 3010.9199999999996
is a tanker

3008.04 --> 3013.5
so you get one third it working

3010.92 --> 3015.54
perfectly one third

3013.5 --> 3017.88
it not working

3015.54 --> 3020.359
and causing worry and costing money and

3017.88 --> 3020.359
one third

3022.64 --> 3027.0
explaining on how complex it all is and

3025.38 --> 3029.94
how much worth it is

3027.0 --> 3032.96
that's what tinkerers do

3029.94 --> 3032.96
get used to it

3053.339 --> 3057.0
yeah

3054.9 --> 3060.3
and by the way yeah that doesn't happen

3057.0 --> 3063.68
to me at all like ever just for the

3060.3 --> 3063.6800000000003
record I don't tinker

3063.9 --> 3070.1600000000003
how many times did my computer break in

3066.66 --> 3070.16
order for me not to have a show

3072.359 --> 3078.0
oh yeah that was like two weeks what is

3075.48 --> 3080.819
it two three years ago now

3078.0 --> 3083.359
and then I had a new computer and then

3080.819 --> 3086.579
it immediately worked and everything

3083.359 --> 3090.74
worked since yeah that's what you get

3086.579 --> 3090.7400000000002
for not tinkering

3092.82 --> 3096.01
[Music]

3110.76 --> 3114.8
something works it don't touch it yeah

3115.68 --> 3119.7
well you don't add anything you don't

3117.839 --> 3122.52
change anything you might clean it up

3119.7 --> 3125.819
more Right cleaning up your computer

3122.52 --> 3129.18
makes it faster that's just a fact

3125.819 --> 3133.38
so that I keep very careful track of the

3129.18 --> 3136.46
filing where the data is on the disk

3133.38 --> 3136.46
keep it orderly

3136.619 --> 3139.579
keep it clean

3145.559 --> 3151.6800000000003
and try to avoid installing a known

3148.38 --> 3154.339
crappy programs as much as possible

3151.68 --> 3154.339
foreign

3162.37 --> 3165.58
[Music]

3180.9 --> 3183.9
anyway

3185.52 --> 3192.619
I'm doing great

3188.3 --> 3192.619
I'm feeling all peachy

3193.619 --> 3198.2400000000002
because I have two peaches and they're

3196.44 --> 3200.46
awesome I've been getting these they're

3198.24 --> 3202.9799999999996
like Demeter quality

3200.46 --> 3207.079
Which is higher than organic

3202.98 --> 3207.079
and I've been enjoying them a lot

3209.46 --> 3213.319
just feel so good

3213.5 --> 3218.7
organic like highest quality

3216.54 --> 3220.68
it's like pretty much one of the best

3218.7 --> 3222.98
tasting types of peaches that I've ever

3220.68 --> 3222.98
had

3223.079 --> 3230.48
and there were over a Euro a piece

3226.5 --> 3230.48
they seem very much worth it

3233.76 --> 3240.1800000000003
oh funny how satellites never break down

3238.02 --> 3244.14
yeah because they can't because

3240.18 --> 3248.8999999999996
everything would be completely trashed

3244.14 --> 3248.9
you'll get giant space debris situations

3248.94 --> 3255.82
BKK Dave anyway cheers

3252.74 --> 3255.8199999999997
[Music]

3258.88 --> 3263.9
[Music]

3261.119 --> 3263.9
wow

3264.44 --> 3273.13
[Music]

3273.319 --> 3280.64
you would think the manufacturers

3277.619 --> 3283.5
would have used planned

3280.64 --> 3286.64
obsolescence for more what

3283.5 --> 3286.64
more profit

3304.92 --> 3312.619
might be why the trolls are omery today

3308.52 --> 3312.619
oh did they [ __ ] around with him again

3324.359 --> 3330.319
well it is I mean ooh Barbie Dolls

3327.0 --> 3330.319

3330.54 --> 3335.52
[Music]

3333.3 --> 3337.98
which apparently I don't know but I've

3335.52 --> 3339.3
heard that it's actually not woke for a

3337.98 --> 3343.38
change

3339.3 --> 3346.8
which makes me interested it's so weird

3343.38 --> 3349.079
man I mean woke has [ __ ] ruined all

3346.8 --> 3352.02
of movies so bad

3349.079 --> 3354.1800000000003
that now at this point is like if

3352.02 --> 3356.94
they're like is it a rumor going around

3354.18 --> 3358.2599999999998
like a new Hollywood movie and it's not

3356.94 --> 3361.92
work

3358.26 --> 3365.5200000000004
it's like immediately a blockbuster like

3361.92 --> 3368.4
immediately even if it's like a cheap to

3365.52 --> 3371.7599999999998
make movie it's like but it's not woke

3368.4 --> 3375.2000000000003
guys we gotta see this I mean like oh

3371.76 --> 3377.28
the non-workless oh finally awesome

3375.2 --> 3379.98
non-woke off

3377.28 --> 3381.5400000000004
guzzle that down please more and unlock

3379.98 --> 3383.579
ah

3381.54 --> 3386.7799999999997
like

3383.579 --> 3386.78
it's kind of happening

3389.52 --> 3393.54
it's like you want to make like a

3391.619 --> 3396.6600000000003
gigantic Blockbuster that has like

3393.54 --> 3398.7599999999998
enormous success even if everybody in

3396.66 --> 3400.7999999999997
media mainstream media talk [ __ ] about

3398.76 --> 3403.88
it you want to have like the best

3400.8 --> 3408.3590000000004
record-selling movie ever make it

3403.88 --> 3413.579
anti-love not non-work anti like exactly

3408.359 --> 3416.16
the opposite like the perfect opposition

3413.579 --> 3419.2400000000002
where everything is exactly the opposite

3416.16 --> 3419.24
of how they like it

3424.92 --> 3430.6800000000003
make it as classically stereotypical

3429.18 --> 3434.7
Proto

3430.68 --> 3435.839
family unit type situation as Proto as

3434.7 --> 3438.48
possible

3435.839 --> 3441.119
you'll get a record-selling movie even

3438.48 --> 3444.3
if it's not that cool even if it's not

3441.119 --> 3446.4
that interesting it doesn't matter

3444.3 --> 3448.1400000000003
although it would matter of course I

3446.4 --> 3450.599
mean if it sucks as a movie then yeah

3448.14 --> 3452.64
that doesn't really matter

3450.599 --> 3456.1800000000003
you gotta have a movie

3452.64 --> 3459.9
but if you make it super anti-woke

3456.18 --> 3462.0
you get a Blockbuster in in between all

3459.9 --> 3465.119
these shitty insane people that should

3462.0 --> 3468.66
literally be committed to asylums

3465.119 --> 3471.48
for still thinking that oh woke is

3468.66 --> 3473.7599999999998
better like Oh no you're [ __ ] out of

3471.48 --> 3476.04
your mind and everybody [ __ ] thinks

3473.76 --> 3479.7000000000003
you're out of your mind you should be

3476.04 --> 3484.2799999999997
committed you are delusional

3479.7 --> 3484.2799999999997
to a degree that is intenable

3484.92 --> 3490.14
these people making these movies are

3487.14 --> 3494.0
[ __ ] out of their minds because they

3490.14 --> 3494.0
are throwing away all that money

3495.96 --> 3501.0
so it's probably like grabler Bankers

3498.72 --> 3503.7599999999998
that are just like giving them that [ __ ]

3501.0 --> 3505.92
knowing it's gonna fail

3503.76 --> 3508.0200000000004
but these people themselves they should

3505.92 --> 3510.54
you should stop

3508.02 --> 3513.66
you're playing into sickness your own

3510.54 --> 3519.119
sickness nobody wants woke everybody

3513.66 --> 3522.299
hates it yeah everybody but freak people

3519.119 --> 3527.1800000000003
freak people that are all gonna be dead

3522.299 --> 3527.18
within 20 years because of suicide

3527.52 --> 3532.619
even if people try to talk them out of

3529.859 --> 3535.339
it yeah so it doesn't [ __ ] matter if

3532.619 --> 3538.7000000000003
you're gonna appeal to woke everybody

3535.339 --> 3538.7
hates it

3543.78 --> 3548.46
nobody gives a [ __ ] about your appeal to

3546.66 --> 3552.74
people that are all going to be dead in

3548.46 --> 3552.7400000000002
20 years by their own doing yeah

3554.099 --> 3557.7000000000003
you want to work movie

3555.96 --> 3560.7
that's cool

3557.7 --> 3563.2799999999997
make it underground make your [ __ ]

3560.7 --> 3564.839
little woke movie underground spread it

3563.28 --> 3567.78
around you could do that on the internet

3564.839 --> 3569.52
nobody cares it's free on the internet

3567.78 --> 3572.2200000000003
yeah

3569.52 --> 3574.619
but don't [ __ ] try to do that [ __ ]

3572.22 --> 3576.859
through Hollywood with like Millions

3574.619 --> 3580.44
invested yeah

3576.859 --> 3584.64
everybody hates it

3580.44 --> 3585.9
even if something was potentially a good

3584.64 --> 3588.66
movie

3585.9 --> 3592.02
yeah if there is a woke trait that

3588.66 --> 3596.339
eventually finds itself into the core

3592.02 --> 3598.559
plot it literally destroys the entire

3596.339 --> 3601.319
thing retroactively

3598.559 --> 3604.1600000000003
yeah and I'm not the only one that

3601.319 --> 3604.16
experiences that

3605.28 --> 3610.1600000000003
don't do it again

3610.68 --> 3617.22
give up on your [ __ ] delusional

3614.04 --> 3619.2
[ __ ] it's not real it will never be

3617.22 --> 3621.5989999999997
real and all the people that stick to

3619.2 --> 3624.7799999999997
thinking that that's real all kill

3621.599 --> 3627.1800000000003
themselves eventually yeah

3624.78 --> 3630.98
that's how [ __ ] up delusional it

3627.18 --> 3630.98
really is so stop doing it

3637.26 --> 3639.8590000000004
oh

3643.76 --> 3649.1400000000003
right but I heard that the weirdo Barty

3647.099 --> 3652.079
movie is not

3649.14 --> 3653.8799999999997
is not woke or something not super woke

3652.079 --> 3658.079
anyway it's like

3653.88 --> 3660.839
they they actually had a blonde haired

3658.079 --> 3662.28
cool looking

3660.839 --> 3665.819
Ken

3662.28 --> 3667.92
like he wasn't black can you imagine how

3665.819 --> 3669.7799999999997
dare they they actually had a can that

3667.92 --> 3673.079
wasn't black

3669.78 --> 3676.3190000000004
because it would have to be black it you

3673.079 --> 3678.3590000000004
can't have a white good looking man male

3676.319 --> 3679.74
role model even if he's a bit dumb you

3678.359 --> 3681.9
can't have that

3679.74 --> 3686.18
right well they did they did it they had

3681.9 --> 3689.73
a movie a live-action movie with a white

3686.18 --> 3692.8289999999997
male Ken yeah

3689.73 --> 3692.829
[Music]

3696.54 --> 3703.5589999999997
almost makes me want to go watch it

3701.4 --> 3706.26
which is really crazy because it's a

3703.559 --> 3707.6400000000003
freaking Barbie movie so I don't give a

3706.26 --> 3709.7400000000002
[ __ ]

3707.64 --> 3712.6189999999997
but it almost makes me want to watch it

3709.74 --> 3714.7799999999997
because it's anti-work and I'm that

3712.619 --> 3715.619
fanatical about it which is a problem by

3714.78 --> 3717.78
the way

3715.619 --> 3719.4
it's a sickness on its own I mean yeah

3717.78 --> 3721.5
woke people

3719.4 --> 3722.76
it's a real big problem you hang on to

3721.5 --> 3724.74
that you're probably gonna end up

3722.76 --> 3726.2990000000004
killing yourself a lot of people do get

3724.74 --> 3729.1189999999997
out of it though

3726.299 --> 3731.28
but I'm so [ __ ] anti-woke

3729.119 --> 3733.44
that it's almost the same kind of

3731.28 --> 3735.96
sickness it's just that

3733.44 --> 3738.42
I could have been woke but I chose to be

3735.96 --> 3739.68
anti-woke instead to have the same

3738.42 --> 3744.26
pattern

3739.68 --> 3744.2599999999998
but to be absolutely anti

3746.52 --> 3751.619
it's a pattern

3748.319 --> 3754.38
it's it's similar with like Christianity

3751.619 --> 3756.48
I mean it's the reason why I originally

3754.38 --> 3760.339
turned to Satanism before I found out

3756.48 --> 3760.339
how actually [ __ ] up it is

3760.68 --> 3766.2599999999998
when I still thought oh Satanism is just

3762.96 --> 3768.66
anti-church anti those corrupt pedo

3766.26 --> 3770.099
[ __ ] bastards

3768.66 --> 3772.2
and then it turned out that it wasn't

3770.099 --> 3775.02
and it was actually in the [ __ ]

3772.2 --> 3778.819
church that those pedo [ __ ] bastards

3775.02 --> 3778.819
are the [ __ ] satanists

3779.0 --> 3783.44
yeah that was a big shocker

3785.16 --> 3790.319
but I'm just saying there's a pattern

3786.96 --> 3792.42
there's a i i turn anti things I do that

3790.319 --> 3794.94
it's like I hate something so bad I

3792.42 --> 3796.619
become the exact opposite and because of

3794.94 --> 3799.14
my artistic

3796.619 --> 3803.819
and communication talents I can

3799.14 --> 3807.5
literally create an antithesis pattern

3803.819 --> 3807.5
to those things and I do

3808.68 --> 3814.5589999999997
yeah and then people say oh we gotta

3811.559 --> 3818.7200000000003
stop hate we gotta stop I like [ __ ] that

3814.559 --> 3818.7200000000003
hate is a powerful tool

3819.0 --> 3823.619
like don't let it consume you don't let

3822.54 --> 3828.0
it

3823.619 --> 3830.54
ruin your life it can do that yeah

3828.0 --> 3832.98
but

3830.54 --> 3834.9
I use it

3832.98 --> 3837.18
do I not

3834.9 --> 3841.339
I've got it tamed I can do things with

3837.18 --> 3841.339
it I can it's like yeah

3844.559 --> 3849.8390000000004
I disagree hate is acceptable hate is

3848.099 --> 3852.54
acceptable and by the way Allah's

3849.839 --> 3854.94
[ __ ] woke people they are foaming at

3852.54 --> 3857.46
the mouth hate about anything that's not

3854.94 --> 3860.4
work a lot of them

3857.46 --> 3863.2200000000003
so it's [ __ ] [ __ ] anyway they

3860.4 --> 3866.28
hate like the worst of them

3863.22 --> 3868.68
and they hate with no reason with no

3866.28 --> 3871.559
actual logical reasoning behind it other

3868.68 --> 3875.1189999999997
than it's a threat because I'm weaker

3871.559 --> 3878.099
the the strong threaten you don't they

3875.119 --> 3881.28
that's why you attack them yeah

3878.099 --> 3885.54
well I do exactly the opposite I worship

3881.28 --> 3890.1600000000003
the strong and I despise the weak

3885.54 --> 3893.7599999999998
yeah if I see like a a blonde dude

3890.16 --> 3896.339
that's like taller than me and he has

3893.76 --> 3897.7200000000003
that like determinate facial expression

3896.339 --> 3900.72
I'm like

3897.72 --> 3902.9399999999996
dude you're awesome what can I do for

3900.72 --> 3905.5789999999997
you how can I assist you

3902.94 --> 3908.4
like what are you doing can I help

3905.579 --> 3910.2000000000003
because I find that awesome I find it

3908.4 --> 3913.2000000000003
awesome that that's there

3910.2 --> 3917.54
because those people have energy they

3913.2 --> 3917.54
have momentum they have care

3919.319 --> 3922.14
they have the actual care for others a

3921.48 --> 3926.66
lot

3922.14 --> 3926.66
right yeah woke doesn't do that

3927.059 --> 3934.3
everything is about them

3930.2 --> 3937.439
recruiting more peons into their cult

3934.3 --> 3937.4390000000003
[Music]

3938.94 --> 3945.2400000000002
it fuels their ideology yeah hate out of

3941.94 --> 3948.42
weakness it's spite it's not just hate

3945.24 --> 3950.04
it's spite that fuels their ideology

3948.42 --> 3952.14
spite

3950.04 --> 3955.74
yeah

3952.14 --> 3958.44
because not all hate is like that my

3955.74 --> 3962.52
hate is vengeance

3958.44 --> 3965.2400000000002
it's Vengeance Revenge

3962.52 --> 3968.7
and it's not

3965.24 --> 3970.14
particularly good or Noble or even

3968.7 --> 3972.66
christ-like

3970.14 --> 3974.339
I know

3972.66 --> 3976.319
it's neutral

3974.339 --> 3978.119
because of how you do it if you're

3976.319 --> 3981.14
always vengeful you're gonna hurt people

3978.119 --> 3981.1400000000003
that don't deserve it

3981.54 --> 3986.46
but

3982.92 --> 3992.7000000000003
if you're too forgiving

3986.46 --> 3996.42
then evil will use that against you as

3992.7 --> 4000.2599999999998
it has in the West

3996.42 --> 4004.28
and that's why we're here now

4000.26 --> 4004.28
because of Tolerance

4006.619 --> 4012.799
yeah

4008.24 --> 4014.839
and forgiveness towards those that do

4012.799 --> 4017.0
not deserve it

4014.839 --> 4020.48
because

4017.0 --> 4024.099
they don't want to redeem they just want

4020.48 --> 4024.099
to get away and do it again

4029.45 --> 4032.64
[Music]

4047.059 --> 4051.38
right but at least here in the

4048.92 --> 4054.92
Netherlands it's not half as terrible as

4051.38 --> 4056.6600000000003
like in places like the United States I

4054.92 --> 4058.039
mean I cannot believe that they're doing

4056.66 --> 4059.42
that

4058.039 --> 4061.94
I mean

4059.42 --> 4064.819
the way it's dilapidated in certain

4061.94 --> 4066.5
cities is so bad there should be death

4064.819 --> 4068.72
penalties

4066.5 --> 4070.76
specifically for that

4068.72 --> 4073.0989999999997
for what what

4070.76 --> 4074.7200000000003
the organizer like what the [ __ ]

4073.099 --> 4078.94
police Chiefs and all that have done

4074.72 --> 4078.9399999999996
they deserve the death penalty

4079.88 --> 4087.02
like literally

4082.839 --> 4090.38
normalizing criminals like

4087.02 --> 4093.619
like you can't do anything about it like

4090.38 --> 4097.22
you can't defend yourself against overt

4093.619 --> 4097.22
criminal Behavior

4097.52 --> 4102.7390000000005
the people that have caused that to be

4099.98 --> 4104.3589999999995
to the their cities like that in America

4102.739 --> 4107.199
because that's where it's happening

4104.359 --> 4111.58
people that have caused that

4107.199 --> 4111.58
deserve the death penalty

4113.359 --> 4119.56
because they have caused so many

4115.9 --> 4122.9
absolutely innocent people to get hurt

4119.56 --> 4125.2390000000005
it is innumerable by now

4122.9 --> 4129.099999999999
it's it's so bad out there it's so much

4125.239 --> 4129.099999999999
that they lose they're losing count

4129.859 --> 4133.339
and like

4131.179 --> 4136.4
some of these cities

4133.339 --> 4138.739
just singular stores have so many

4136.4 --> 4142.04
robberies every single day they

4138.739 --> 4144.62
literally can't keep track of it

4142.04 --> 4147.08
yeah it's crazy it's just like it's a

4144.62 --> 4149.0599999999995
loot store it's not it's not a store

4147.08 --> 4151.94
anymore it's just like come and collect

4149.06 --> 4156.02
your stuff that you're gonna steal

4151.94 --> 4158.839
because we can't do anything about it

4156.02 --> 4160.9400000000005
that's absolutely insane I do not

4158.839 --> 4163.339
understand why there aren't just people

4160.94 --> 4166.339
around that are just [ __ ] like I'm

4163.339 --> 4168.199
just gonna be a roof sniper

4166.339 --> 4170.239
just like oh oh there's a looting gag

4168.199 --> 4173.9
okay get out of here

4170.239 --> 4175.639999999999
yeah and it's like oh no poor man who

4173.9 --> 4177.5
gives a [ __ ] yeah there's gonna be a

4175.64 --> 4180.1990000000005
protest right yeah more opportunity to

4177.5 --> 4181.66
just shoot more of them more of these

4180.199 --> 4183.2789999999995
disgusting

4181.66 --> 4186.94
anti-civilization

4183.279 --> 4186.9400000000005
looting gangsters

4187.179 --> 4191.66
that you've let in and you let it faster

4189.739 --> 4194.178999999999
and it's gonna get worse and worse and

4191.66 --> 4197.0
worse yeah those types of people will

4194.179 --> 4200.42
eventually just start torturing people

4197.0 --> 4202.58
purely to to dominate yeah they will

4200.42 --> 4205.34
publicly start torturing people they're

4202.58 --> 4208.76
already like halfway there yeah there's

4205.34 --> 4211.360000000001
one solution for that you [ __ ] kill

4208.76 --> 4211.360000000001
them all

4213.92 --> 4220.76
you let go of civilization that badly

4217.12 --> 4222.739
then you should just be shot

4220.76 --> 4226.159000000001
just like that

4222.739 --> 4231.759999999999
and anybody who stops that from the top

4226.159 --> 4231.759999999999
down deserves the death penalty

at this point if if the police is like

4339.32 --> 4344.48
that

4340.64 --> 4347.659000000001
then as the actual public and not the

4344.48 --> 4349.879999999999
disgusting looting goblins

4347.659 --> 4352.82
you should declare war on that police

4396.199 --> 4401.62
so yeah I'm yeah that's right I'm

4398.659 --> 4404.48
actually calling for vigilantism

4401.62 --> 4407.179
vigilanteism how do you say it Gillette

4404.48 --> 4409.04
vigilantism

4407.179 --> 4410.719
is that how you say it whatever I'm

4409.04 --> 4414.44
calling for it it's like yeah the police

4410.719 --> 4416.54
is literally not gonna do anything

4414.44 --> 4420.28

4416.54 --> 4420.28
people that should be doing something

4421.4 --> 4424.299999999999
let's do it

4424.58 --> 4428.48
do it as a hobby

4426.56 --> 4431.2390000000005
do it on the side

4428.48 --> 4432.919999999999
find a good roof spot why you know it's

4431.239 --> 4435.199
like oh yeah there's 30 robberies a day

4432.92 --> 4438.56
here oh okay let's see if we can cut

4435.199 --> 4441.678999999999
down those robberies a bit Yeah because

4438.56 --> 4444.26
It's usually the same group of people so

4441.679 --> 4446.96
if you just shoot them dead on the

4444.26 --> 4450.1990000000005
street before they get in guess what

4446.96 --> 4452.06
it's gonna stop oh oh yeah wow yeah

4450.199 --> 4454.5199999999995
after those kids got shot

4452.06 --> 4456.679
suddenly the robberies went down by 50

4454.52 --> 4459.14
huh

4456.679 --> 4461.679
now with just the others

4459.14 --> 4461.679

4481.84 --> 4488.900000000001
nitrous oxide yeah yeah

4485.12 --> 4493.48
it is legal that's right

4488.9 --> 4493.48
nitrous oxide can be very useful

4495.62 --> 4502.46
they even sell it at uh infowar store

4500.48 --> 4503.599999999999
they have it like in powder form that's

4502.46 --> 4506.42
like

4503.6 --> 4509.54

4506.42 --> 4512.78
in a certain way in your blood I've been

4509.54 --> 4515.36
interested in actually trying that out

4512.78 --> 4517.82
but I don't have any money to do that I

4515.36 --> 4519.86
mean before I go ordering at infowar

4517.82 --> 4522.799999999999
store again I gotta have like at least

4519.86 --> 4525.199
200 Euros of surplus

4522.8 --> 4527.84
and I don't

4525.199 --> 4530.659
so unless as somebody like unless people

4527.84 --> 4533.3
are gonna pile on like 300 Euros in one

4530.659 --> 4536.32
day there's no way that I'm gonna

4533.3 --> 4536.320000000001
order there again

4538.699 --> 4543.678999999999
unless GTI starts working unless

4540.92 --> 4545.34

4598.219 --> 4603.7390000000005
like has Cops like that that literally

4600.8 --> 4605.84
only arrest people that actually do

4603.739 --> 4608.599999999999
something about like serious gangster

4605.84 --> 4610.64
problems and all that when they don't

4608.6 --> 4612.1990000000005
then you should team up with like a

4610.64 --> 4614.54
whole bunch of people and literally like

4612.199 --> 4616.5199999999995
go to the police station

4614.54 --> 4618.8
find the police chief and [ __ ] shoot

4616.52 --> 4620.360000000001
him in the head and anybody else that

4618.8 --> 4622.1
gets in your way too

4620.36 --> 4624.92
you should just do that

4622.1 --> 4627.4400000000005
it's like oh oh oh you're helping the

4624.92 --> 4629.42
gangsters well then you [ __ ] die

4627.44 --> 4632.62
[ __ ]

4629.42 --> 4632.62
now you die

4636.679 --> 4642.62
I mean you can do it there in the United

4639.679 --> 4645.38
States you actually do have guns you can

4642.62 --> 4647.599999999999
actually do that yeah over here that's

4645.38 --> 4650.179
[ __ ] difficult as [ __ ]

4647.6 --> 4653.96
you can't do that here if a police force

4650.179 --> 4657.9800000000005
is corrupted you got a [ __ ] problem

4653.96 --> 4660.92
you gotta like be super rich lawyer fat

4657.98 --> 4663.08
and then go after them and and still

4660.92 --> 4666.38
might not see but in the United States

4663.08 --> 4669.98
there's guns and plenty if cops are that

4666.38 --> 4672.82
corrupt you can technically group up and

4669.98 --> 4672.82
[ __ ] kill them

4672.98 --> 4679.099999999999
yeah and nobody would even know it was

4675.86 --> 4679.099999999999
you afterward

4680.42 --> 4685.219
like

4682.64 --> 4687.4400000000005
it's just like yeah let's let's form a

4685.219 --> 4689.3
new police department because the old

4687.44 --> 4691.159
one's dead

4689.3 --> 4693.52
there you go you form a new police

4691.159 --> 4693.5199999999995
department

4701.06 --> 4705.8
your crabbler dentist gave you nitrous

4704.36 --> 4710.38
hmm

4705.8 --> 4710.38
yeah well it can be used as a sedative

4710.78 --> 4715.179
a sedative

4713.239 --> 4719.0599999999995
for Dentistry

4715.179 --> 4721.719
yeah I've never used it though

4719.06 --> 4721.719
for that

4721.88 --> 4727.1
maybe one time

4724.34 --> 4729.679
although I don't think that what I think

4727.1 --> 4731.179
that was like

4729.679 --> 4734.26
yeah there was something else that

4731.179 --> 4734.26
wasn't nitrous oxide

4734.96 --> 4740.0
I think I might have used it like once

4736.699 --> 4742.94
or two I think it's weird stuff man

4740.0 --> 4746.179
it's weird stuff but I think it also

4742.94 --> 4748.58
just impacts my physical being a lot

4746.179 --> 4749.84
like I really feel it when I got it in

4748.58 --> 4751.94
me

4749.84 --> 4753.860000000001
it's supposedly like widens up your

4751.94 --> 4757.219
blood vessels and all that and I

4753.86 --> 4761.9
typically have low blood pressure

4757.219 --> 4764.06
so I really feel when it hits it's like

4761.9 --> 4765.739
that you got to do that lying that or I

4764.06 --> 4768.6990000000005
gotta do that lying down otherwise I

4765.739 --> 4768.699
might black out

4768.8 --> 4770.8
um

4774.38 --> 4778.58
I had cops shooting at my dad and that's

4777.679 --> 4781.04
not

4778.58 --> 4783.679
that wasn't really

4781.04 --> 4786.62
I mean they they basically yeah they

4783.679 --> 4788.9
shot one time it was just a [ __ ] move I

4786.62 --> 4792.08
went 26.

4788.9 --> 4794.42
it was just being Nazi threatening

4792.08 --> 4797.48
it's not like direct it's not like they

4794.42 --> 4799.219
literally just opened fire and kill the

4797.48 --> 4801.259999999999
farmer or something

4799.219 --> 4804.32
okay I mean if they're gonna do that

4801.26 --> 4806.84
it's gonna be War

4804.32 --> 4809.239
m i mean those Farmers they got stuff

4806.84 --> 4811.6990000000005
and they're like they got equipment they

4809.239 --> 4814.459999999999
got the skills they could technically

4811.699 --> 4816.86
fabricate weapons if they wanted to

4814.46 --> 4819.02
relatively quickly like like Americans

4816.86 --> 4820.82
with a workshop can too they can do that

4819.02 --> 4823.64
too they're not [ __ ] [ __ ] they

4820.82 --> 4825.44
know craft they got 3D print they got

4823.64 --> 4828.1
all kinds of stuff because yeah farmers

4825.44 --> 4828.099999999999
are rich

4828.86 --> 4833.48
because

4830.54 --> 4835.159
they do endless amounts of work and

4833.48 --> 4838.82
they're good businessmen

4835.159 --> 4840.98
and they have to have equipment to make

4838.82 --> 4842.9
equipment because sometimes they gotta

4840.98 --> 4844.699
make the equipment because it literally

4842.9 --> 4847.879999999999
doesn't exist yet

4844.699 --> 4849.98
they're inventing it as they go so they

4847.88 --> 4853.219
can make stuff they could make Weaponry

4849.98 --> 4855.62
if if like the [ __ ] police state

4853.219 --> 4858.44
actually starts killing them like that

4855.62 --> 4862.34
that happens it's gonna be War guys it

4858.44 --> 4865.339999999999
like you have freaking a team Style

4862.34 --> 4867.32
like assault tractors and [ __ ] I'm not

4865.34 --> 4868.82
even joking they would Pro they would do

4867.32 --> 4872.86
that

4868.82 --> 4872.86
have you ever fired a weapon

4882.679 --> 4887.36
yes I have

4884.6 --> 4889.1
not a lot though but we used to have

4887.36 --> 4892.42
like Airsoft

4889.1 --> 4892.42
which had like lead

4892.64 --> 4897.7390000000005
bullets

4894.32 --> 4900.199
little pallet bullets I shot a lot with

4897.739 --> 4901.82
that as a team like a lot I was really

4900.199 --> 4903.739
fascinated with it and got pretty good

4901.82 --> 4906.139999999999
at it

4903.739 --> 4908.0
I had somebody actually shot one of

4906.14 --> 4910.159000000001
those things at me

4908.0 --> 4911.659
lucky not to lose an eye when that

4910.159 --> 4913.339999999999
happened but that was like crazy

4911.659 --> 4914.78
neighbors

4913.34 --> 4917.179
uh

4914.78 --> 4919.94
and I think I also

4917.179 --> 4924.159
life at least held handguns

4919.94 --> 4924.159
that were illegal by the way

4924.739 --> 4928.58
I don't remember if I actually shot a

4927.32 --> 4931.4
live bullet

4928.58 --> 4935.179
or not I don't remember

4931.4 --> 4936.799999999999
I've heard it happen though very loud I

4935.179 --> 4940.0
don't like guns they're so [ __ ] loud

4936.8 --> 4940.0
it hurts my ears

4941.36 --> 4945.739
like if I remember gonna have a gun I

4943.4 --> 4950.08
want a gun with a silencer

4945.739 --> 4950.08
just to protect my freaking ears

4956.77 --> 4959.969
[Music]

4963.739 --> 4968.799999999999
right so yeah

4966.08 --> 4971.48
I've not really practiced firing a gun

4968.8 --> 4974.8
like that an actual

4971.48 --> 4974.799999999999
an actual gun

4976.94 --> 4983.419999999999
seven millimeter rifle

4980.239 --> 4986.139999999999
shoot that's okay

4983.42 --> 4986.14
why

4986.78 --> 4993.219
why the [ __ ] would I [ __ ] my pants

4989.78 --> 4993.219
the hell are you blabbering about

5001.84 --> 5008.32
yeah I know that bigger guns with bigger

5006.4 --> 5010.36
yeah big guns yeah and they have a lot

5008.32 --> 5012.659
of recoil why would I [ __ ] my pants over

5010.36 --> 5012.659
that

5017.32 --> 5021.0
a BB gun what

5024.64 --> 5028.38
knock you on your yeah I know

5031.78 --> 5037.36
like if I'm gonna try shooting something

5034.0 --> 5039.28
I'm gonna lean into it I know how guns

5037.36 --> 5041.5
work I've actually paid a lot of

5039.28 --> 5044.8
attention

5041.5 --> 5047.739
it's just that I'm in the Netherlands

5044.8 --> 5049.2390000000005
there is no guns they just aren't there

5047.739 --> 5050.919999999999
and if they're there they're [ __ ]

5049.239 --> 5054.28
illegal

5050.92 --> 5056.32
and they don't want to like oh let's go

5054.28 --> 5058.54
there and just practice Yeah that's very

5056.32 --> 5061.799999999999
rare

5058.54 --> 5061.8
because it's illegal

5064.0 --> 5066.6
what

5068.5 --> 5071.5
ah

5071.86 --> 5077.339999999999
[ __ ] moon buggy that's [ __ ]

5077.8 --> 5081.820000000001
Jesus

5079.78 --> 5084.4
Desert Eagle can break your wrist yeah

5081.82 --> 5086.199
yeah if you don't have proper grip yeah

5084.4 --> 5088.299999999999
you can't shoot that like oh I'm gonna

5086.199 --> 5091.08
shoot it on the side yeah you [ __ ]

5088.3 --> 5091.08
break your arm

5092.44 --> 5097.599999999999
foreign yeah

5094.96 --> 5099.219
Desert Eagle pretty heavy it's like a

5097.6 --> 5101.679
magnum right

5099.219 --> 5103.78
Magnums are even worse

5101.679 --> 5105.1
Magnums are like hand cannons if you

5103.78 --> 5107.32
don't have strong wrists you can

5105.1 --> 5109.3
literally break them if you shoot in one

5107.32 --> 5111.34
hand

5109.3 --> 5114.04
is hunting legal

5111.34 --> 5116.9800000000005
with a lot of permits yes

5114.04 --> 5118.78
there are hunt Seasons but it's

5116.98 --> 5120.759999999999
it's very small in the Netherlands

5118.78 --> 5123.34
compared to other countries but a lot of

5120.76 --> 5127.12
Hunter types they're like might be Dutch

5123.34 --> 5129.88
and then they go to Germany or

5127.12 --> 5130.96
other regions where there's a hunting

5129.88 --> 5133.6
season

5130.96 --> 5136.96
so the Netherlands doesn't really have a

5133.6 --> 5140.08
very wide wild forest most of our forest

5136.96 --> 5142.12
is kind of Park it's like it's been

5140.08 --> 5144.5199999999995
turned into like Parks it's not really

5142.12 --> 5146.62
wild forest as much if you want more

5144.52 --> 5148.659000000001
wild forests then you really need to go

5146.62 --> 5150.219
more East into Germany they have so much

5148.659 --> 5153.179
Forest it's just

5150.219 --> 5153.179
never stops

5153.52 --> 5160.620000000001
or what it does stop at the city but

5155.699 --> 5160.62
outside of the city is like all forests

5165.659 --> 5171.839999999999
yeah you're not using the gun correctly

5168.1 --> 5171.84
if you break your wrist yeah I know

5174.699 --> 5179.919999999999
are there lots of homeless and nettles

5177.219 --> 5182.38
no not so much

5179.92 --> 5185.1990000000005
there were some homeless problems like

5182.38 --> 5187.6
in the 90s but it was like taken care of

5185.199 --> 5191.138999999999
so

5187.6 --> 5194.679
they basically like really make effort

5191.139 --> 5195.82
and investment to get rid of them but

5194.679 --> 5199.38
not like

5195.82 --> 5199.38
to basically help them out

5201.46 --> 5206.199
there's a lot of it they really made

5203.62 --> 5208.84
effort like a real socialist effort to

5206.199 --> 5210.879999999999
actually fix the homeless and then they

5208.84 --> 5213.6990000000005
could still be homeless but that not

5210.88 --> 5216.6990000000005
bother people

5213.699 --> 5218.98
right and and and have better hygiene

5216.699 --> 5220.78
make sure they have the good food like

5218.98 --> 5223.0
that's like oh yeah they're still gonna

5220.78 --> 5224.8
be like roaming around because they

5223.0 --> 5226.48
don't want a house

5224.8 --> 5227.679
but you can make sure that at least

5226.48 --> 5229.178999999999
they're not gonna stink and they're

5227.679 --> 5231.34
going to be more healthy and they're not

5229.179 --> 5233.8
going to be as crazy

5231.34 --> 5235.12
and so they did do that here in the

5233.8 --> 5237.159000000001
Netherlands

5235.12 --> 5240.46
because here in Utrecht there used to be

5237.159 --> 5242.199
this huge area where this is like full

5240.46 --> 5244.2390000000005
with bumps they were like hundreds and

5242.199 --> 5246.219
hundreds of them

5244.239 --> 5248.5599999999995
and they weren't really harassing people

5246.219 --> 5250.9
but it was still like Jesus why are they

5248.56 --> 5253.96
all those bums there and they

5250.9 --> 5257.32
well they got rid of that

5253.96 --> 5258.159
there's just much less of him and they

5257.32 --> 5259.659
got

5258.159 --> 5260.92
places

5259.659 --> 5262.659
they got

5260.92 --> 5264.159
yeah I don't know where they are I mean

5262.659 --> 5266.82
some of them might still be roaming

5264.159 --> 5266.82
around but

5266.92 --> 5273.639
like I basically like know three hobos

5271.84 --> 5276.28
through the regions that I go through

5273.639 --> 5278.92
including my almost inner city and it's

5276.28 --> 5280.54
like there's three and that's that's all

5278.92 --> 5282.82
I know

5280.54 --> 5284.08
I know there are more but I don't see a

5282.82 --> 5286.36
lot of them there's just not as many

5284.08 --> 5288.4
many around anymore

5286.36 --> 5291.5199999999995
and they're not dead

5288.4 --> 5292.9
unless they all got like the corona shot

5291.52 --> 5295.900000000001
or whatever

5292.9 --> 5299.679
I don't know but they were off the

5295.9 --> 5302.86
streets even before that happened

5299.679 --> 5304.4800000000005
it was mostly like early late 90s early

5302.86 --> 5306.699
2000s

5304.48 --> 5309.089999999999
that's when it's all stopped

5306.699 --> 5312.04
and they fixed it

5309.09 --> 5314.9800000000005
[Music]

5312.04 --> 5318.639
problem from your place in the U.S to be

5314.98 --> 5318.638999999999
homeless internet what

5319.9 --> 5325.54
well to be fair homeless in the Nellis

5322.6 --> 5327.58
could definitely be worse yeah

5325.54 --> 5329.86
to be homeless in the Netherlands is

5327.58 --> 5333.0599999999995
really good compared to being homeless

5329.86 --> 5333.0599999999995
in other countries yeah

5334.719 --> 5340.42
unless they don't like you

5338.26 --> 5341.9800000000005
because homeless people will still [ __ ]

5340.42 --> 5344.1
each other up if they don't like each

5341.98 --> 5344.099999999999
other

5353.98 --> 5361.0599999999995
there's a lot of homeless too that are

5356.26 --> 5364.2390000000005
like weird have weird sjw programming

5361.06 --> 5368.46
they are there

5364.239 --> 5368.459999999999
you're afraid of Americans okay

5372.639 --> 5378.4800000000005
well they're probably more afraid of you

5374.739 --> 5378.48
than you are of them five roads

5384.34 --> 5388.08
afraid of the stupidity

5386.86 --> 5391.44
yeah

5388.08 --> 5391.44
I can imagine

5392.8 --> 5398.320000000001
what I mean the stupidity really is like

5395.56 --> 5400.56
a side effect of just blatant negligence

5398.32 --> 5400.5599999999995
though

5401.739 --> 5407.5599999999995
right it's the negligence that allows

5404.639 --> 5411.179
all of that to keep going the way it is

5407.56 --> 5411.179
it's negligence

5412.42 --> 5417.9
right it can be stopped there can be

5414.82 --> 5419.44
things done against it but they don't

5417.9 --> 5422.94
negligence

5419.44 --> 5422.94
problem is negligence

5427.36 --> 5432.099999999999
it's not stupid it is negligence

5430.78 --> 5435.5199999999995
right because

5432.1 --> 5437.38
stupidity can be actually negligence

5435.52 --> 5439.540000000001
because

5437.38 --> 5443.32
if you act stupid

5439.54 --> 5446.0199999999995
then people will not look at you like

5443.32 --> 5447.28
usually like you are being negligent no

5446.02 --> 5449.8
they just think oh you're just being

5447.28 --> 5451.659
stupid well if you're stupid then you

5449.8 --> 5453.6990000000005
couldn't be expected to actually do

5451.659 --> 5455.98
something about anything

5453.699 --> 5457.419999999999
right so people

5455.98 --> 5459.218999999999
Act

5457.42 --> 5461.679
stupid

5459.219 --> 5465.659
to get away

5461.679 --> 5465.659
with being negligent

5466.719 --> 5469.32
mm-hmm

5471.219 --> 5478.06
you feel that familiarity you recognize

5474.88 --> 5481.78
that pattern yeah

5478.06 --> 5485.620000000001
it's a lot of people that act stupid

5481.78 --> 5488.8
so they can get away with negligence

5485.62 --> 5492.179
I think Americans are like one of the

5488.8 --> 5492.179
best at that

5492.52 --> 5495.360000000001
in the world

5497.22 --> 5500.4890000000005
[Music]

5508.9 --> 5515.638999999999
all right just play like a dumbass and

5511.239 --> 5515.638999999999
you can get away with almost everything

5516.52 --> 5520.3
you can do whatever you want if you just

5518.44 --> 5522.48
act like you're stupid people will let

5520.3 --> 5522.4800000000005
you

5536.26 --> 5540.900000000001
what we need to talk about lumpy gas

5541.0 --> 5545.08
MRI done terrified he was going through

5543.46 --> 5548.52
the ripped what are you talking about

5545.08 --> 5548.5199999999995
what's going on here

5576.28 --> 5581.639
sounds like a really ugly fight you guys

5578.92 --> 5581.639
are talking about

5581.76 --> 5585.54
nasty street fight

5589.719 --> 5594.94
eat pie yeah that's not everybody else

5592.3 --> 5595.900000000001
that's American yeah we don't eat pie

5594.94 --> 5600.0599999999995
here

5595.9 --> 5600.0599999999995
because we're not bloated people

5604.36 --> 5609.639
Pi is something here you only eat at a

5607.179 --> 5612.639
very special occasion like a birthday

5609.639 --> 5613.92
we don't eat pie every day

5612.639 --> 5618.3
because

5613.92 --> 5618.3
we stay thin

5627.159 --> 5632.259999999999
I do really appreciate a nice piece of

5630.159 --> 5634.719
apple pie that's like organically made

5632.26 --> 5638.1
though so

5634.719 --> 5638.1
but it's not a habit

5638.679 --> 5643.32
sometimes I just love smelling it and

5640.84 --> 5643.32
that's enough

5648.88 --> 5652.84
but yeah we don't eat pancakes for

5651.219 --> 5656.34
breakfast

5652.84 --> 5656.34
we don't eat pie

5660.4 --> 5665.879999999999
and so we don't turn into bloaty people

5667.239 --> 5671.879999999999
laser tag yeah laser tag it's

5669.4 --> 5671.879999999999
interesting

5672.46 --> 5678.6
there was laser tagged during my teens

5674.38 --> 5678.6
too I was really thrilled doing that

5681.159 --> 5686.44
I'm decently good at it too except that

5684.46 --> 5688.719
like the laser mechanisms just didn't

5686.44 --> 5690.759999999999
really work consistently like there were

5688.719 --> 5692.9800000000005
some lasers you could fire like beside

5690.76 --> 5694.900000000001
somebody and you still had and there

5692.98 --> 5697.12
were other lasers like you could fire

5694.9 --> 5699.46
straight at it you saw it hitting and it

5697.12 --> 5702.099999999999
wouldn't register like it wasn't super

5699.46 --> 5704.86
stable that was annoying about it

5702.1 --> 5709.5
but yeah laser tag was very exciting

5704.86 --> 5709.5
to me reminded me of like uh

5709.739 --> 5715.12
kept in power and the soldiers of the

5712.42 --> 5717.9
future was like that but like you were

5715.12 --> 5717.9
the one doing that

5725.219 --> 5730.96
yeah I mean laser tagged like was like

5728.98 --> 5734.58
the personification of that Sci-Fi

5730.96 --> 5734.58
series where anybody remember that

5750.52 --> 5752.6990000000005
foreign

5765.4 --> 5769.48
to defend him screw you slow my wound

5767.92 --> 5773.34
buggy

5769.48 --> 5773.339999999999
we don't have a Miss Netherlands

5774.42 --> 5778.38
that's a man baby

5781.659 --> 5786.54
not that I really care about those tools

5784.12 --> 5786.54
anyway

5787.179 --> 5793.719
I mean I already like I know who I find

5791.139 --> 5796.719
the most beautiful there's like really

5793.719 --> 5798.82
beautiful women out there

5796.719 --> 5803.219
yeah

5798.82 --> 5803.219
that are act Battlestar collected what

5809.32 --> 5813.159
are you talking about Battlestar

5811.719 --> 5815.699
Galactic and that's not what I'm talking

5813.159 --> 5819.04
about I'm talking about Captain power

5815.699 --> 5821.62
and the soldiers of the future just

5819.04 --> 5824.139
[ __ ] Google it already it's super

5821.62 --> 5827.0199999999995
super 80s

5824.139 --> 5829.78
and I [ __ ] love it and I've actually

5827.02 --> 5833.9800000000005
watched that series back a while ago and

5829.78 --> 5836.8
it's like really bizarre how seriously

5833.98 --> 5839.459999999999
written that series actually is

5836.8 --> 5841.659000000001
like it's actually a pretty decent

5839.46 --> 5844.2390000000005
action series

5841.659 --> 5846.5199999999995
you could even say that there was this

5844.239 --> 5848.86
seriousness to it that almost made it

5846.52 --> 5851.7390000000005
relate to like the Terminator Universe

5848.86 --> 5853.9
because it wasn't that far off it was

5851.739 --> 5857.199
basically like a Terminator Universe

5853.9 --> 5858.879999999999
where robots had been taken over there

5857.199 --> 5859.96
were all these robot soldiers but they

5858.88 --> 5862.179
were like

5859.96 --> 5863.32
we need soldiers that you could easily

5862.179 --> 5865.6
shoot

5863.32 --> 5867.159
right it wasn't as threatening as the

5865.6 --> 5869.679
Terminator universe but it was basically

5867.159 --> 5871.179
the same setup but just look back look

5869.679 --> 5873.9400000000005
it up on YouTube

5871.179 --> 5875.08
Captain power and the soldiers of the

5873.94 --> 5877.48
future

5875.08 --> 5879.58
just the intro alone would like blow you

5877.48 --> 5882.638999999999
away with the Practical effects of that

5879.58 --> 5884.98
is all practical effects practical

5882.639 --> 5887.139
effects in screening

5884.98 --> 5890.82
a slight seizure warning they have a lot

5887.139 --> 5890.82
of blinking light things going on

5892.6 --> 5897.06
how was the voice acting badass

5900.159 --> 5906.879999999999
and I mean it was pretty damn serious

5904.0 --> 5910.96
because like it was actual like a

5906.88 --> 5912.400000000001
soldier fight thing like people died

5910.96 --> 5915.82
and

5912.4 --> 5918.46
like it was pretty damn serious

5915.82 --> 5921.759999999999
even though it looked like it was like

5918.46 --> 5924.28
uh the type of props as you would see in

5921.76 --> 5927.34
Judge Dredd the 80s Judge Dread

5924.28 --> 5929.5
right like you're at the motorcycle oh

5927.34 --> 5932.56
futurist motorcycle pieces of plastic

5929.5 --> 5934.36
stuck on it now it's of the future oh

5932.56 --> 5937.84
that was kind of what Captain power was

5934.36 --> 5941.339999999999
like too but the story and the acting

5937.84 --> 5941.34
was pretty damn serious

5941.98 --> 5949.919999999999
and like they had like these super

5944.26 --> 5949.92
robots that would digitize them

5950.1 --> 5955.179
now you're digitized you're lost forever

5953.32 --> 5957.46
you're like locked in their computer

5955.179 --> 5960.58
prison or something and it was really

5957.46 --> 5962.7390000000005
scary even though it's like a silly like

5960.58 --> 5964.6
it was pretty freaking menacing to me

5962.739 --> 5967.419999999999
it's like ah I don't want to be

5964.6 --> 5970.2390000000005
digitized it would be locked in like a

5967.42 --> 5972.219
digital prison forever

5970.239 --> 5974.32
and now we're talking about oh yeah

5972.219 --> 5976.9800000000005
we're building the future who can be

5974.32 --> 5981.159
immortal by being uploaded in a computer

5976.98 --> 5983.259999999999
yes yes oh you mean like digitizing yeah

5981.159 --> 5985.48
that thing that you really didn't want

5983.26 --> 5989.139
to happen it's like what the [ __ ] man

5985.48 --> 5990.699
now this crazy technology people are

5989.139 --> 5993.219
talking about like oh yeah we're gonna

5990.699 --> 5996.099999999999
just digitize so you can live forever in

5993.219 --> 5998.219
the computer like oh like in Captain

5996.1 --> 6003.06
power eh

5998.219 --> 6004.679
yeah I'll skip on that thank you

6003.06 --> 6007.8
laughs

6004.679 --> 6010.679
really watch it watch Captain power your

6007.8 --> 6013.56
mind will be [ __ ] blown guys your

6010.679 --> 6015.78
mind will be blown if you compare what's

6013.56 --> 6018.179
happening in that series to what's going

6015.78 --> 6021.92
on in the world now your mind will be

6018.179 --> 6021.92
blown I guarantee it

yeah yeah thanks for telling me yeah

6249.36 --> 6254.219
mute it I hear you but I mean yeah it

6252.0 --> 6257.1
looks cheesy steamy Traveler

6254.219 --> 6261.119
but I mean Judge Dredd looked cheesy too

6257.1 --> 6263.400000000001
was it a Cheesy movie was the actual

6261.119 --> 6267.179
when you think of this is what's going

6263.4 --> 6270.839999999999
on was it cheesy no it was brutal

6267.179 --> 6274.1990000000005
yeah and this series is not cheesy it's

6270.84 --> 6276.0
[ __ ] serious yeah it looks cheesy and

6274.199 --> 6279.178999999999
the names are like wow it's almost like

6276.0 --> 6282.84
a cartoon but it's acted pretty damn so

6279.179 --> 6285.0
you can watch the series on YouTube it's

6282.84 --> 6288.900000000001
all there and it's it's pretty damn

6285.0 --> 6292.26
serious guys yeah it's it's a like

6288.9 --> 6294.78
quality Wise It's like comparable to

6292.26 --> 6295.9800000000005
Hercules remember that series very

6294.78 --> 6298.739
popular

6295.98 --> 6301.799999999999
so it's like a little low Tech a bit

6298.739 --> 6304.379999999999
they had like the the cheap polygon 3D

6301.8 --> 6306.78
but hey dudes the freaking 80s man that

6304.38 --> 6309.0
was like high-tech CGI back then okay

6306.78 --> 6312.3
really high tech that's like the one of

6309.0 --> 6313.139
the first CGI I've ever seen with my

6312.3 --> 6315.06
eyes

6313.139 --> 6318.36
I know I thought it was pretty damp

6315.06 --> 6321.84
spectacular for the time being

6318.36 --> 6324.299999999999
but the series itself is pretty it's

6321.84 --> 6325.679
like acted serious it's a serious story

6324.3 --> 6329.639
it's not

6325.679 --> 6333.42
supposed to be goofy it's just like it's

6329.639 --> 6335.46
aimed at younger kids and so the names

6333.42 --> 6337.56
and such are like pretty straightforward

6335.46 --> 6340.199
like a lord dread and all this and that

6337.56 --> 6342.42
right it's like yeah yeah yeah it's a

6340.199 --> 6344.5199999999995
bit stereotypical but it's actually

6342.42 --> 6346.679
pretty damn serious and like Laura dread

6344.52 --> 6349.7390000000005
is a really [ __ ] up psychopath that

6346.679 --> 6353.219
just kills people and [ __ ]

6349.739 --> 6356.54
like an evil Lord would right so they

6353.219 --> 6359.4
they just like took a typical

6356.54 --> 6361.639
old-fashioned like medieval story and

6359.4 --> 6364.32
then futurized it with the

6361.639 --> 6366.78
post-apocalyptic scenario and they did

6364.32 --> 6367.619
it really well it's very serious it's

6366.78 --> 6370.32
like

6367.619 --> 6372.98
it is like a military

6370.32 --> 6372.98
unit

6374.04 --> 6380.0
it's military style the heroes

6377.4 --> 6382.799999999999
and the opponents are like medieval Lord

6380.0 --> 6385.34
type opponent and it's it's it's

6382.8 --> 6388.4400000000005
actually much better than you expect

6385.34 --> 6390.659000000001
Canadian show was it huh

6388.44 --> 6393.48
well no wonder nobody heard of it then

6390.659 --> 6395.638999999999
but it was actually really damn good I

6393.48 --> 6398.638999999999
really liked it

6395.639 --> 6400.619
and if you go watch the series

6398.639 --> 6404.219
then at the end of it you're gonna be

6400.619 --> 6406.739
like yeah this was actually really had

6404.219 --> 6409.7390000000005
so much potential it like had almost as

6406.739 --> 6411.54
much potential as Star Wars okay and

6409.739 --> 6414.48
it's a series

6411.54 --> 6418.56
really I'm not joking it's it's pretty

6414.48 --> 6420.419999999999
damn good it's just a bit cheap

6418.56 --> 6423.54
but they did a lot with it and it was

6420.42 --> 6425.219
they was they were all really into it

6423.54 --> 6427.199
these aren't like actors that are like

6425.219 --> 6430.139
oh it's a stupid show I gotta make a

6427.199 --> 6433.58
paycheck no they were really into it

6430.139 --> 6433.58
and that really helps

6434.88 --> 6437.4800000000005
so

6438.78 --> 6444.179
great time to be a kid yeah when it

6441.719 --> 6447.119
comes to cartoons for sure it's the

6444.179 --> 6450.3
Golden Age of Saturday morning cartoons

6447.119 --> 6452.94
where did I find that show it was on

6450.3 --> 6455.46
television in the Netherlands

6452.94 --> 6457.619
in the 80s

6455.46 --> 6459.9
I didn't even know it was Canadian guys

6457.619 --> 6461.699
I didn't know that I thought it was

6459.9 --> 6463.619
American I mean this looked like the

6461.699 --> 6466.199
most freaking American thing ever it's

6463.619 --> 6468.299999999999
about soldiers of the future and it's

6466.199 --> 6470.879999999999
like yeah I mean that should have been

6468.3 --> 6473.400000000001
American but I guess it's Canadian I

6470.88 --> 6475.7390000000005
didn't know that

6473.4 --> 6476.759999999999
but we got to see that on the television

6475.739 --> 6479.599999999999
here

6476.76 --> 6479.6
glorious

6495.9 --> 6501.239
atmosphere of a good arcade yes yeah I

6498.6 --> 6502.5
had that too LSG I was really addicted

6501.239 --> 6504.599999999999
to Arcade

6502.5 --> 6507.48
when we would go to Spain with my

6504.6 --> 6510.360000000001
parents me and yeah as a kid

6507.48 --> 6512.28
there was like this one arcade place or

6510.36 --> 6514.38
there were two and so there were like

6512.28 --> 6516.659
cities we would typically go to for

6514.38 --> 6518.52
shopping and I knew an arcade there and

6516.659 --> 6519.44
it was like can I go to an arcade can I

6518.52 --> 6522.0
go to her again

6519.44 --> 6523.619
because I was like yeah play your game

6522.0 --> 6525.36
for freaking hours and hours and they

6523.619 --> 6526.799999999999
were awesome games there

6525.36 --> 6528.659
oh

6526.8 --> 6529.679
there's something magical about an

6528.659 --> 6532.08
arcade

6529.679 --> 6533.6990000000005
and you can't find that back yeah I mean

6532.08 --> 6535.739
you can now have those games on

6533.699 --> 6537.839999999999
emulators on your computer it's just not

6535.739 --> 6539.459999999999
the same

6537.84 --> 6542.1
because there's no other kids looking

6539.46 --> 6544.199
over your shoulder how you're playing it

6542.1 --> 6547.139
like that although you could technically

6544.199 --> 6550.08
now stream it but it's not the same it's

6547.139 --> 6552.119
just not the same as it used to be

6550.08 --> 6555.6
there was a real magic about it all that

6552.119 --> 6558.92
back then it's kind of gone

6555.6 --> 6558.92
it's coming and went

6565.619 --> 6569.82
the kids were dead when you were growing

6567.42 --> 6571.92
up then yes yeah because it was all

6569.82 --> 6574.38
getting replaced by game consoles the

6571.92 --> 6577.1990000000005
Nintendo the Super Nintendo yeah that

6574.38 --> 6579.719
was in the 90s

6577.199 --> 6582.419999999999
and then arcade in the 80s late 80s

6579.719 --> 6584.46
arcades were already kind of dying

6582.42 --> 6587.04
but there were still plenty around and

6584.46 --> 6588.36
there would be like the good games that

6587.04 --> 6591.3
they kept around

6588.36 --> 6592.86
so actually the late 80s were better

6591.3 --> 6595.08
because

6592.86 --> 6596.28
in the early 80s there was like arcades

6595.08 --> 6599.1
all over the place where they were like

6596.28 --> 6601.86
these shitty old games from like the 70s

6599.1 --> 6603.719
that nobody gave the [ __ ] about anymore

6601.86 --> 6605.46
and then eventually those kind of got

6603.719 --> 6608.46
dumped and then you had to Arcade with

6605.46 --> 6610.9800000000005
only really newer games and that was

6608.46 --> 6613.08
awesome like that was the best time for

6610.98 --> 6616.5
arcade because it had it had the best

6613.08 --> 6618.239
games all of them like everybody knew

6616.5 --> 6619.98
what games were popular and then they

6618.239 --> 6622.379999999999
wanted to have an arcade with all those

6619.98 --> 6625.218999999999
games so it would all be epic

6622.38 --> 6625.219
great times

6627.3 --> 6630.3
wow

6631.86 --> 6637.92
LOL

6634.679 --> 6640.5
now for me was hot Chase

6637.92 --> 6643.26
dude hot Chase is Revolution I have hot

6640.5 --> 6645.239
Chase on my computer I have the emulator

6643.26 --> 6649.52
for it

6645.239 --> 6653.638999999999
that game was a 3D racing game that used

6649.52 --> 6656.820000000001
Sprites like Mario Kart

6653.639 --> 6659.400000000001
but it was really impressive

6656.82 --> 6661.44
was like an action racing game that made

6659.4 --> 6664.259999999999
no sense but did was just [ __ ]

6661.44 --> 6665.82
actions just like action movie [ __ ]

6664.26 --> 6667.619000000001
you felt like you were in The Last

6665.82 --> 6669.659
Action Hero or something

6667.619 --> 6671.639
it was just badass

6669.659 --> 6673.92
you're driving in a Porsche you got a

6671.639 --> 6675.2390000000005
bomb in your car and you got to go

6673.92 --> 6677.52
through the time

6675.239 --> 6679.5
you've got to get the time limits or

6677.52 --> 6681.360000000001
your car blows up and in the meantime

6679.5 --> 6683.34
there's helicopters shooting you and

6681.36 --> 6686.28
people throwing hand grenades and

6683.34 --> 6688.1990000000005
literal bombers dropping bombs and it

6686.28 --> 6689.82
was so Overkill but it was [ __ ]

6688.199 --> 6694.46
badass

6689.82 --> 6694.46
just badass game with a badass music

6695.699 --> 6699.259999999999
I played that game a lot

6705.36 --> 6709.739
of it went arm and get super nerdy it's

6707.82 --> 6710.82
not that nerdy it's computer games it's

6709.739 --> 6714.718999999999
not

6710.82 --> 6717.0599999999995
come on it's like that nerdy

6714.719 --> 6719.76
it's just games

6717.06 --> 6721.9400000000005
but they made so much impact on me back

6719.76 --> 6721.9400000000005
then

6724.86 --> 6729.839999999999
like games were really made to be

6727.26 --> 6732.3
spectacular back then now they're made

6729.84 --> 6733.7390000000005
to like oh can we capture somebody's

6732.3 --> 6735.900000000001
mind because they're all bunch of

6733.739 --> 6738.119
[ __ ] [ __ ] wussies

6735.9 --> 6741.119
yeah we could do that oh so there we

6738.119 --> 6744.259999999999
have all [ __ ] wussy games everywhere

6741.119 --> 6744.259999999999
that are lame

6748.38 --> 6750.92
together

6754.139 --> 6759.0
or like

6755.659 --> 6761.699
CGI score spectacles like oh look at

6759.0 --> 6764.1
those sexy our girls are oh we got the

6761.699 --> 6766.0199999999995
sexy demons and we got the sexy goblins

6764.1 --> 6768.719
and we got the sexy everything is like

6766.02 --> 6772.34
oh flashy flashy yeah and that's how you

6768.719 --> 6772.34
get the stupid elf girl thing

6772.5 --> 6776.94
on the internet yeah that's how you get

6774.48 --> 6778.98
that because of that [ __ ] gaming

6776.94 --> 6782.178999999999
[ __ ] that they do returning everybody

6778.98 --> 6782.178999999999
into retards

6784.8 --> 6789.78
like they're turning everybody into

6788.1 --> 6791.9400000000005
Pokemon

6789.78 --> 6794.58
in the gaming industry like you're

6791.94 --> 6798.239
becoming a Pokemon

6794.58 --> 6801.42
and now you like stupid things

6798.239 --> 6804.678999999999
because you are a Pokemon so you throw

6801.42 --> 6808.4
money at crazy people that act

6804.679 --> 6808.4
ridiculous on the internet

6809.699 --> 6814.08
acting all sexy when they absolutely

6812.1 --> 6815.34
shouldn't because they're not even adult

6814.08 --> 6818.699
yet

6815.34 --> 6820.7390000000005
and that's it yeah

6818.699 --> 6823.259999999999
just because people are being turned

6820.739 --> 6825.119
into Pokemon weirdo things that are

6823.26 --> 6827.400000000001
unnatural and don't know how to behave

6825.119 --> 6829.199
naturally but still got your instinctual

6827.4 --> 6832.58
impulses

6829.199 --> 6832.58
and so [ __ ] up

6837.119 --> 6843.139
funny voice and waves to Center okay the

6839.82 --> 6843.139
good on you that you like that

6847.08 --> 6851.94
I gotta personify the silly that I'm

6849.9 --> 6854.42
pointing out somehow

6851.94 --> 6854.419999999999
anyway

6857.04 --> 6861.78
yeah you have to get in the public

6859.56 --> 6864.860000000001
building socialize to be part of the

6861.78 --> 6864.86
game that's right

6867.9 --> 6872.159
it's all without the internet yeah isn't

6870.0 --> 6875.42
it amazing how it all worked without the

6872.159 --> 6875.42
internet isn't it

6905.34 --> 6909.42
super player as a kid and still had a

6907.44 --> 6912.178999999999
lot yeah more colored but that's

6909.42 --> 6915.179
the poor kids that don't get all the

6912.179 --> 6918.3
[ __ ] from their parents they often end

6915.179 --> 6921.9800000000005
up a lot happier with more effective

6918.3 --> 6921.9800000000005
more creative imagination

6922.26 --> 6927.3
I'm somewhere like in between my parents

6924.96 --> 6930.119
did kind of spoil me a little they

6927.3 --> 6932.9400000000005
always did give me what I wanted

6930.119 --> 6935.46
but not if it was too expensive

6932.94 --> 6938.219
so I did get a lot of Legos I got a

6935.46 --> 6940.619
Nintendo and a Super Nintendo eventually

6938.219 --> 6942.3
and some games but it didn't like always

6940.619 --> 6944.5199999999995
get what I wanted hey what are you doing

6942.3 --> 6947.0
well big ass why are you timing fluffy

6944.52 --> 6947.0
snow at

6949.619 --> 6952.28
what are you doing

6967.02 --> 6970.040000000001
bumpy gas

6976.26 --> 6978.9800000000005
hello

6981.42 --> 6986.78
please explain yourself or I'm gonna

6983.46 --> 6986.78
have to take your wrench away

7006.739 --> 7011.54
okay lumpy gas

7008.78 --> 7013.46
speak up now or forever lose your wrench

7011.54 --> 7017.26
because apparently your account is

7013.46 --> 7017.26
compromised then

7022.639 --> 7028.219
maybe exit yeah but if he's not even

7025.82 --> 7030.799999999999
there to respond

7028.219 --> 7033.94
then that just means that he's not

7030.8 --> 7033.9400000000005
stable enough

7034.099 --> 7040.84
I can't have people randomly timed out

7038.06 --> 7040.84
like that

7041.659 --> 7045.759999999999
and he doesn't even seem to be here

7052.82 --> 7059.78
the timing on this yeah but

7056.42 --> 7062.36
I would have timed out fluffy snow if I

7059.78 --> 7065.78
thought that he was being a [ __ ]

7062.36 --> 7068.5599999999995
point is is that that's not the way we

7065.78 --> 7068.5599999999995
do things here

7070.4 --> 7074.0
like sometimes I don't even ban overt

7072.86 --> 7076.5199999999995
trolls

7074.0 --> 7078.739
because they're trying to ask questions

7076.52 --> 7081.92
that are uncomfortable whatever and then

7078.739 --> 7084.919999999999
they just overtly answer them right

7081.92 --> 7087.38
phone pocket and easily yeah but then he

7084.92 --> 7089.119
should be hearing how I'm telling him to

7087.38 --> 7091.9400000000005
speak up now because you timed out

7089.119 --> 7095.5
somebody for nothing he's not speaking

7091.94 --> 7095.5
up so I'm taking that wrench

7095.84 --> 7100.639
this is not because of his actions it's

7098.599 --> 7101.900000000001
just because it doesn't seem to really

7100.639 --> 7104.179
have a

7101.9 --> 7106.78
stable account

7104.179 --> 7106.78
then

7112.44 --> 7115.7699999999995
[Music]

7121.26 --> 7124.7390000000005
[Music]

7132.02 --> 7136.280000000001
I mean I really appreciate lumpy gas and

7134.659 --> 7140.119
all that but

7136.28 --> 7145.3
can't have him not be here and then

7140.119 --> 7145.299999999999
time out people even by accident

7148.28 --> 7152.239
right and if it was a pocket Bend then

7150.44 --> 7155.619
you have to damn well secure your

7152.239 --> 7155.619
telephone so that doesn't happen

7156.44 --> 7161.32
so yeah

7158.0 --> 7161.32
it's not gonna happen now

7162.76 --> 7167.360000000001
because he's done doesn't have a wrench

7165.139 --> 7171.28
anymore so but that's that's doesn't

7167.36 --> 7171.28
matter I mean we're still cool

7172.78 --> 7175.88
[Music]

7177.139 --> 7179.8
anyway

7191.96 --> 7199.28
I'm scared yeah Richard yeah well look

7196.34 --> 7202.400000000001
even as a teenager I wasn't very social

7199.28 --> 7204.679
I was mostly a nerd during my teens I

7202.4 --> 7209.44
barely got out I got out with well

7204.679 --> 7209.4400000000005
messed up people like making trouble

7209.96 --> 7213.9800000000005
like I I talked about some of that

7211.88 --> 7216.1990000000005
yesterday this guy

7213.98 --> 7218.178999999999
we later like kind of turn into a

7216.199 --> 7220.94
criminal really

7218.179 --> 7222.86
and then eventually turn to a

7220.94 --> 7225.098999999999
Scientology that saved him got him out

7222.86 --> 7225.098999999999
of it

7225.139 --> 7230.599
but yeah I I was mostly just playing on

7228.32 --> 7232.46
my computer my computer games and

7230.599 --> 7235.400000000001
staying at home or getting out there

7232.46 --> 7237.9800000000005
with other kids and just making trouble

7235.4 --> 7239.0599999999995
but not too much trouble but enough

7237.98 --> 7241.598999999999
trouble

7239.06 --> 7241.599
hmm

7247.099 --> 7254.179
but yeah it was really after the 2000s

7250.82 --> 7256.699
after 2000 after my teens that I

7254.179 --> 7258.08
actually really got out there and

7256.699 --> 7260.0
started

7258.08 --> 7263.0599999999995
like socializing

7260.0 --> 7265.88
because the gothic scene

7263.06 --> 7268.88
the gothic scene got to my attention and

7265.88 --> 7273.02
now I had something to really

7268.88 --> 7275.0
dig into and like get familiar with

7273.02 --> 7277.820000000001
all these different things that I never

7275.0 --> 7279.92
even realized were there before

7277.82 --> 7282.38
because it had been going on for a while

7279.92 --> 7285.32
but it never got to my attention and now

7282.38 --> 7288.02
I had a thing a style

7285.32 --> 7290.9
where I could go to so I went to little

7288.02 --> 7293.92
festivals and little parties

7290.9 --> 7293.92
full kinds

7293.96 --> 7298.94
and concerts even

7296.54 --> 7301.159
well before that that was never a thing

7298.94 --> 7303.08
that I did I was just a nerd at home

7301.159 --> 7306.0199999999995
playing video games with his friends or

7303.08 --> 7308.0
getting outside and making trouble

7306.02 --> 7310.099
but it's really in my 20s that I got

7308.0 --> 7312.32
into the gothic scene not in my teens

7310.099 --> 7315.02
well in my teams I was a little bit

7312.32 --> 7316.5199999999995
about that style

7315.02 --> 7319.580000000001
when I was like

7316.52 --> 7322.099
more listening to Prodigy and then like

7319.58 --> 7325.94
things like porn

7322.099 --> 7328.34
it's like and that kind of thing

7325.94 --> 7330.379999999999
it's like still like in between hippie

7328.34 --> 7332.84
and Gothic I didn't know that there was

7330.38 --> 7336.139
like a scene out there

7332.84 --> 7338.360000000001
and I found that out in my early 20s

7336.139 --> 7340.639
like like beginning of my 20s then it's

7338.36 --> 7343.639
when I knew like hey there is

7340.639 --> 7346.46
concerts there's people

7343.639 --> 7350.92
sorry if you offend you didn't

7346.46 --> 7350.92
not necessarily fluffy snow

7352.219 --> 7357.139
all right but I for example I saw that's

7355.34 --> 7359.2390000000005
funny by the way I went to my with my

7357.139 --> 7360.8
brother to that concert a concert of

7359.239 --> 7365.259999999999
ramenstein

7360.8 --> 7365.26
life that's pretty freaking badass

7366.08 --> 7370.76
that was really cool

7368.54 --> 7373.4
that that my brother actually invited me

7370.76 --> 7375.08
to that because we were both into that

7373.4 --> 7377.9
style

7375.08 --> 7379.639
like I was into more stuff like black

7377.9 --> 7381.379999999999
metal and stuff that he thought was

7379.639 --> 7384.38
disgusting

7381.38 --> 7387.46
but he did like Rammstein

7384.38 --> 7387.46
and I like that too

7393.679 --> 7400.599
I had no idea that any of that even

7395.719 --> 7400.599
existed before the 2000s I didn't know

7403.119 --> 7410.36
Ramstein mocks America yeah America

7406.96 --> 7415.04
America yeah

7410.36 --> 7418.098999999999
but it mocks them with good reason

7415.04 --> 7419.78
it's not like uh you American

7418.099 --> 7422.54
you're all suck

7419.78 --> 7425.599
no it's talking about the illusion of

7422.54 --> 7428.96
America it's talking about Satan

7425.599 --> 7431.96
the big guy ramenstein is a lot about

7428.96 --> 7438.219
the beguiling of Satan on the public

7431.96 --> 7442.219
mind and about your inner visceral Beast

7438.219 --> 7444.8
door is so good yeah that's like the

7442.219 --> 7447.7390000000005
inner instinctual side I and both of

7444.8 --> 7449.78
those things I am I mean I am kind of a

7447.739 --> 7454.0599999999995
beast inside

7449.78 --> 7454.0599999999995
can be quite the Beast with women

7455.3 --> 7458.659000000001
in a good way

7456.8 --> 7461.06
so I I get that

7458.659 --> 7463.5199999999995
I like that about ramshein so visceral

7461.06 --> 7465.9800000000005
in that sense it's visceral and

7463.52 --> 7467.900000000001
intellectual

7465.98 --> 7470.0599999999995
or it used to be I don't know they they

7467.9 --> 7472.159
I think they kind of like got a bit more

7470.06 --> 7475.099
Twisted though over time

7472.159 --> 7477.799999999999
not sure I'm not really sure as to like

7475.099 --> 7479.599
where they're really at they might have

7477.8 --> 7481.159000000001
completely like collapsed in on

7479.599 --> 7483.139
themselves

7481.159 --> 7486.5599999999995
I don't know if they like took any shots

7483.139 --> 7488.3
during the 20 2020 and all that I have

7486.56 --> 7491.38
no idea what they're up to now if

7488.3 --> 7491.38
they're still surviving

7491.659 --> 7498.86
but yeah Ramstein had a lot of influence

7495.26 --> 7500.84
on like the late 90s early 2000s lots of

7498.86 --> 7503.119
info it was like the number one band

7500.84 --> 7506.119000000001
back then in a way

7503.119 --> 7506.119
considerably

7507.98 --> 7511.4
you

7509.719 --> 7514.9
okay

7511.4 --> 7514.9

[Music]

[Music]

7528.94 --> 7537.5199999999995
honor yeah I know ramshine

7533.0 --> 7537.52
I can sing that [ __ ] in German

7538.3 --> 7542.35
[Music]

7561.699 --> 7566.259999999999
anyway hope you guys are enjoying the

7564.08 --> 7566.26
show

7566.96 --> 7572.0
man that watching back that Captain

7569.179 --> 7574.4
power intro like really gave me a

7572.0 --> 7576.32
Nostalgia boost

7574.4 --> 7578.42
I mean every time I see that it's like

7576.32 --> 7582.619
oh my hormones just immediately start

7578.42 --> 7584.719
turning on like I'm freaking eight again

7582.619 --> 7589.659
when I saw that the first time I was

7584.719 --> 7589.659
like yeah this is it this is the future

7590.42 --> 7593.4400000000005
this is where it's going

7593.659 --> 7598.219
and I think it was also like the first

7595.76 --> 7601.280000000001
time I even got confronted with the

7598.219 --> 7603.9800000000005
concept of a post-apocalypse era like

7601.28 --> 7606.5
the very first time ever that I actually

7603.98 --> 7609.5
got confronted with that because I saw

7606.5 --> 7612.619
Captain power before the Terminator

7609.5 --> 7614.659
series of course which was very adult

7612.619 --> 7616.009999999999
Terminator movies were not for kids

7614.659 --> 7618.08
obviously

7616.01 --> 7620.54
[Music]

7618.08 --> 7623.239
I was probably a pretty cool I was

7620.54 --> 7625.76
really [ __ ] cool dude I was [ __ ]

7623.239 --> 7629.739
badass

7625.76 --> 7629.7390000000005
or at least I thought it was badass

7633.92 --> 7638.619
no I was really cool with everybody it's

7636.139 --> 7638.619
just that

7640.88 --> 7645.9400000000005
yeah

7642.92 --> 7645.9400000000005
I didn't really fit

7650.139 --> 7659.78
after I don't understand the early 80s

7654.28 --> 7662.119
80s the Ramstein 80s are you sure

7659.78 --> 7665.92
weren't they like in the 90s

7662.119 --> 7665.92
never heard of them in the 80s

7668.06 --> 7677.080000000001
pretty damn sure they started in the 90s

7672.32 --> 7677.08
or became famous in the 90s crafts

7691.159 --> 7696.098999999999
yeah but there were a really interesting

7693.139 --> 7701.2390000000005
bands overall during the 90s I mean

7696.099 --> 7706.04
Hammerstein you had uh

7701.239 --> 7709.759999999999
prodigy very intense

7706.04 --> 7713.78
we had a System of a Down

7709.76 --> 7714.8
right those are all like really [ __ ]

7713.78 --> 7719.119
creative

7714.8 --> 7721.28
like they had a real Unique Style all of

7719.119 --> 7725.199
them and that's all in the 90s they all

7721.28 --> 7725.199
really started doing that in the 90s

7728.239 --> 7734.239
Prodigy was a little early it was like

7730.76 --> 7736.280000000001
really early 90s late 80s

7734.239 --> 7740.98
like the geode to generation and all

7736.28 --> 7740.98
that I had a massive influence on me

7742.94 --> 7746.659
system of a downward great kiwi bed I

7745.28 --> 7748.699
didn't even know they were

7746.659 --> 7750.32
kiwis huh

7748.699 --> 7752.86
I just thought they were like really

7750.32 --> 7752.86
creative

7753.26 --> 7759.139
and like they had this interesting like

7756.02 --> 7760.76
Arabic influence Arabic influence on

7759.139 --> 7762.7390000000005
their style which is like fascinating

7760.76 --> 7765.92
that was really not

7762.739 --> 7768.799999999999
common back then it was really like wow

7765.92 --> 7771.1990000000005
this is pretty unique

7768.8 --> 7774.139
now that sort of thing is like yeah I

7771.199 --> 7777.619
mean it's still very System of a Down

7774.139 --> 7779.54
but I mean a hybridization is like in

7777.619 --> 7781.5199999999995
cultural hybridization it's like it's

7779.54 --> 7783.86
like overdone now everything is like

7781.52 --> 7784.9400000000005
that but back then it was like whoa what

7783.86 --> 7787.839999999999
is this

7784.94 --> 7787.839999999999
this is new

7797.42 --> 7801.56
right well I've been going for two hours

7800.179 --> 7805.4800000000005
now

7801.56 --> 7805.4800000000005
time has flown it's been very fun

7806.3 --> 7810.9400000000005

[Music]

7824.65 --> 7829.25
[Music]

7842.659 --> 7847.759999999999
one of best friends either popular or

7844.82 --> 7850.219
tough didn't get [ __ ] with yeah well I

7847.76 --> 7851.360000000001
all sort of had that one friend that was

7850.219 --> 7853.58
crazy

7851.36 --> 7856.759999999999
and arguably Criminal

7853.58 --> 7859.46
as a kid at least yeah I had him as a

7856.76 --> 7861.56
friend to prevent just that because I

7859.46 --> 7863.06
hung around with that guy he liked me he

7861.56 --> 7865.159000000001
actually liked me

7863.06 --> 7867.38
and I was very loyal to him even though

7865.159 --> 7870.0199999999995
he didn't really deserve it at times

7867.38 --> 7872.119
and everybody was [ __ ] scared of him

7870.02 --> 7875.659000000001
because he would like literally beat

7872.119 --> 7878.86
kids up like in the hospital and [ __ ] it

7875.659 --> 7878.86
was pretty messed up dude

7879.44 --> 7884.36
but people were genuinely scared of him

7882.08 --> 7888.679
and so they knew I was a friend with him

7884.36 --> 7891.139
and nobody picked on me in my town

7888.679 --> 7892.6990000000005
I mean on school they did because they

7891.139 --> 7896.900000000001
didn't know anything about me it wasn't

7892.699 --> 7899.239
that town but yeah

7896.9 --> 7902.0599999999995
being friends with him turned out to be

7899.239 --> 7903.739
very helpful as in kids would leave me

7902.06 --> 7905.719
alone

7903.739 --> 7908.0
because they knew that if they really

7905.719 --> 7909.32
hurt me that that guy would come after

7908.0 --> 7911.719
them

7909.32 --> 7914.0
because he would it did actually happen

7911.719 --> 7916.099
one time he like beat somebody up really

7914.0 --> 7918.98
bad to bleeding

7916.099 --> 7921.1990000000005
after he found out that that kid was

7918.98 --> 7924.678999999999
like oh this is my neighborhood now and

7921.199 --> 7926.659
then just started kicking me and [ __ ]

7924.679 --> 7928.34
like out of nowhere and when I told him

7926.659 --> 7930.0199999999995
yeah he [ __ ] him up

7928.34 --> 7932.2390000000005
so

7930.02 --> 7935.179
how did it it had definitely had its

7932.239 --> 7938.119
advantages being befriended with a crazy

7935.179 --> 7941.08
eye like that was pretty strong

7938.119 --> 7941.08
for that age

7943.88 --> 7951.6990000000005
Saul Rammstein live in Paris cool

7946.699 --> 7951.699
I saw Ramstein live in Amsterdam

7952.239 --> 7958.58
in

7953.86 --> 7958.58
2002 I think 2002

7959.36 --> 7963.0199999999995
with my brother

7961.28 --> 7965.119
which is really weird by the way going

7963.02 --> 7966.860000000001
to a concert with my brothers like the

7965.119 --> 7969.5
only time that ever happened

7966.86 --> 7972.679
but it was really awesome it was really

7969.5 --> 7974.659
honored that he actually invited me

7972.679 --> 7977.92
because I didn't really thank you my

7974.659 --> 7977.92
brother liked me that much

7978.86 --> 7982.759999999999
I would just get on his nerves always

7980.659 --> 7985.579
blabber or blah blah blabber and well

7982.76 --> 7989.5
he's like I'm stoic I don't talk why do

7985.579 --> 7991.28
you always [ __ ] talk just shut up

7989.5 --> 7994.0
this is

7991.28 --> 7994.0
uh

8004.02 --> 8010.860000000001
20 years since you went to a concert

8006.28 --> 8010.86
it's not been that long for me it's been

8011.28 --> 8017.5
12 years with my ex wave Gothic Trevor

8015.46 --> 8020.44
and I mean if you go to wave Gothic

8017.5 --> 8024.46
you're gonna see like

8020.44 --> 8026.619
20 to 50 core inserts because there's

8024.46 --> 8028.4800000000005
that many there's literally hundreds and

8026.619 --> 8031.299999999999
hundreds of bands that play over the

8028.48 --> 8034.119
course of three days in that City

8031.3 --> 8037.360000000001
during wave Gothic together so

8034.119 --> 8039.579
if you've been missing metal and Gothic

8037.36 --> 8043.0599999999995
style bands

8039.579 --> 8045.299999999999
go go wave Gothic but I mean it is in in

8043.06 --> 8045.3
May

8046.119 --> 8050.0199999999995
and it is

8047.98 --> 8051.339999999999
it's not super cheap it's only been

8050.02 --> 8055.780000000001
getting more expensive it's probably

8051.34 --> 8058.54
like 200 Euros at minimum

8055.78 --> 8063.42
and that's not including

8058.54 --> 8063.42
like camping or hotel costs

8092.079 --> 8097.259999999999
it's on a big rock bands before they

8094.239 --> 8097.259999999999
were big okay cool

8111.34 --> 8115.02
oh okay Richard you that's weird

8115.659 --> 8118.379999999999
REM

8119.44 --> 8122.4
wow

8124.36 --> 8129.699
REM

8126.659 --> 8132.82
is not enough cult

8129.699 --> 8134.138999999999
I mean it had like a cope information in

8132.82 --> 8137.799999999999
it for sure

8134.139 --> 8140.139
but I mean REM was really popular

8137.8 --> 8142.119000000001
like we everybody in the Netherlands

8140.139 --> 8145.38
knew about REM they would play that [ __ ]

8142.119 --> 8145.38
on the radio all the time

8150.219 --> 8155.44
especially in the 80s I mean REM was

8152.86 --> 8159.219
like the 80s

8155.44 --> 8160.839999999999
music wise what they did

8159.219 --> 8163.119
30s Plus

8160.84 --> 8165.219
yeah I guess intellectually it was aimed

8163.119 --> 8168.759999999999
at the more adult

8165.219 --> 8171.099
I never really got into REM that much

8168.76 --> 8172.54
I was much more like about the police

8171.099 --> 8176.82
and

8172.54 --> 8176.82
Kate Bush that was my thing

8177.28 --> 8182.079
as a preteen

8179.079 --> 8184.239
and then in teen I got into like Prodigy

8182.079 --> 8187.119
and that yeah well you know where the

8184.239 --> 8189.82
rest went I just literally told you a

8187.119 --> 8192.82
half an hour ago

8189.82 --> 8192.82
foreign

8196.62 --> 8203.639000000001
bikes

8198.58 --> 8203.639
and they're singing that is so adorable

8212.33 --> 8221.649
[Music]

8224.679 --> 8230.460000000001
so glad people are still having kids

8226.96 --> 8230.46
here I'm so glad

8232.0 --> 8237.76
dude when this sjw [ __ ] started to break

8235.059 --> 8239.08
out in 2000.

8237.76 --> 8241.479
12

8239.08 --> 8244.0
I think it was yeah 2012 is going to

8241.479 --> 8247.059
really hit off with Obama I thought like

8244.0 --> 8249.34
we're like we're all dead I was so

8247.059 --> 8251.32
terrified when I thought like that's

8249.34 --> 8253.479
gonna get so bad that literally there

8251.32 --> 8255.82
will be no more kids

8253.479 --> 8258.279999999999
in 20 years

8255.82 --> 8259.66
I'm really glad I turned out to be wrong

8258.28 --> 8261.880000000001
about that

8259.66 --> 8264.939
really glad

8261.88 --> 8268.559
people are just still doing it like

8264.939 --> 8268.559000000001
nothing really happened I'm so glad

8269.38 --> 8275.979
I wish I was among them by the way

8273.219 --> 8278.678999999998
but I got to find the right woman yet

8275.979 --> 8281.26
and somehow also be able to guarantee

8278.679 --> 8284.979
financially I mean I am not gonna be a

8281.26 --> 8288.54
Poor Dad it's like I can't do it

8284.979 --> 8288.539999999999
I wouldn't be able to live with myself

8288.88 --> 8291.598999999998
uh

8296.62 --> 8299.62
wow

8310.599 --> 8315.460000000001
are you not dead yet get out amongst it

8313.3 --> 8318.3
what

8315.46 --> 8318.3
what do you mean

8323.979 --> 8329.858999999999
hey I'm I'm keeping an eye out for women

8327.34 --> 8331.059
it's just that

8329.859 --> 8335.439
yeah

8331.059 --> 8338.139
I mean I am I keep playing myself down

8335.439 --> 8342.219000000001
and saying I'm a wreck like no I am very

8338.139 --> 8345.279999999999
capable of doing it it's just I'm very

8342.219 --> 8347.08
uncertain about things

8345.28 --> 8348.58
but I guess it's always going to be like

8347.08 --> 8350.74
that no matter what my position I mean

8348.58 --> 8354.58
if I'd be rich I'd be just as insecure

8350.74 --> 8357.399
because I mean I'm just taking

8354.58 --> 8359.439
getting kids and having a wife that

8357.399 --> 8361.199999999999
you're and which is basically gonna be

8359.439 --> 8364.719000000001
picking you the mother of your children

8361.2 --> 8367.599
I know how [ __ ] serious that is

8364.719 --> 8369.82
it's a serious alchemy that literally

8367.599 --> 8371.8
changes the very nature of your own

8369.82 --> 8375.219
spirit

8371.8 --> 8377.018999999998
so I'm kind of nervous about that

8375.219 --> 8378.119999999999
and I'm not like oh I'll just pick this

8377.019 --> 8381.639000000001
one like

8378.12 --> 8383.679
no I can't I can't do it I mean

8381.639 --> 8386.438999999998
theoretically it would be mechanically

8383.679 --> 8389.8
possible for me to do that

8386.439 --> 8392.2
but I can't get myself to just do that I

8389.8 --> 8393.46
gotta find somebody that's like where I

8392.2 --> 8396.880000000001
know

8393.46 --> 8398.858999999999
that they can basically take over to the

8396.88 --> 8402.24
level that I would do it at in the

8398.859 --> 8402.24
moments where I crash

8402.7 --> 8409.359
because I will crash

8405.82 --> 8412.74
at times it's part of the

8409.359 --> 8412.74
the building process

8415.0 --> 8418.38
spiritually for me

8418.78 --> 8423.220000000001
if I'm gonna like entangle with somebody

8420.58 --> 8425.68
else there will be a point

8423.22 --> 8428.14
where I am gonna crash because it's like

8425.68 --> 8430.24
this is not how I normally work I'm

8428.14 --> 8432.039999999999
gonna have to rebalance myself and in

8430.24 --> 8434.74
order to rebalance yourself you gotta

8432.04 --> 8439.060000000001
crash and when you gotta crash you gotta

8434.74 --> 8440.02
have a wife that like really understands

8439.06 --> 8441.819
that

8440.02 --> 8443.800000000001
and it's not going to be like oh my God

8441.819 --> 8445.06
what did he just turn into I I don't

8443.8 --> 8446.979
want to live with that

8445.06 --> 8449.019999999999
because that's a [ __ ] nightmare and

8446.979 --> 8450.699999999999
then it'll end and that's kind of what

8449.02 --> 8453.640000000001
happened with my ex too I showed her

8450.7 --> 8455.439
some of my other size the Less Pleasant

8453.64 --> 8457.0
ones

8455.439 --> 8461.08
and

8457.0 --> 8464.02
I think that literally broke it for her

8461.08 --> 8466.96
because well she didn't really want

8464.02 --> 8469.359
a serious Bond anyway I think she was

8466.96 --> 8471.938999999998
just more into it toward the sex

8469.359 --> 8474.7
which I can't blame her for because I am

8471.939 --> 8476.439
really good at it

8474.7 --> 8479.26
right I mean

8476.439 --> 8480.76
staying in a relationship for three

8479.26 --> 8483.22
years

8480.76 --> 8485.74
where you're living with them

8483.22 --> 8487.899
after half a year

8485.74 --> 8490.539999999999
when they originally just wanted you for

8487.899 --> 8493.06
sex yeah that that's saying something

8490.54 --> 8496.54
that says like I'm really good at it

8493.06 --> 8499.26
then because I am

8496.54 --> 8499.26
with women

8501.88 --> 8507.06
it's a good thing to be nervous about

8503.62 --> 8507.060000000001
yes that's that's true

8511.359 --> 8515.2
they're protecting the last baby born

8513.28 --> 8517.960000000001
yes

8515.2 --> 8520.54
and I am all about that Richard G I am

8517.96 --> 8523.539999999999
about that I am so about defending women

8520.54 --> 8527.380000000001
and children so much like I will turn

8523.54 --> 8529.899000000001
like I'm into a freaking demonic monster

8527.38 --> 8532.119999999999
that will literally scratch people's

8529.899 --> 8535.24
eyes out

8532.12 --> 8538.02
and like just tear their limbs off with

8535.24 --> 8540.46
my bare hands and weight and whatever

8538.02 --> 8541.66
just to [ __ ] protect those children

8540.46 --> 8543.88
and women

8541.66 --> 8547.14
absolutely but that's like the only

8543.88 --> 8547.14
thing I do it for though

8548.74 --> 8553.78
I will be absolutely Savage

8551.56 --> 8555.96
when it comes to protecting women and

8553.78 --> 8555.960000000001
children

8556.81 --> 8561.809
[Music]

8566.92 --> 8571.3
I mean like

8568.66 --> 8573.16
it gets adrenaline and like it just

8571.3 --> 8574.779999999999
works like that even if kids among

8573.16 --> 8576.58
themselves they're like bullying each

8574.78 --> 8578.800000000001
other and then kids can like really

8576.58 --> 8582.58
scream in anguish and then sometimes I'm

8578.8 --> 8584.619999999999
like I'm like alert alert there might be

8582.58 --> 8586.6
like a pedophile hurting a kid or

8584.62 --> 8588.640000000001
something like yeah that sounds stupid

8586.6 --> 8590.979000000001
doesn't it but it is like what happens

8588.64 --> 8592.3
and I'm like I'm going walking on the

8590.979 --> 8594.22
roof and I'm staring there what's

8592.3 --> 8596.858999999999
happening is that just stupid kids among

8594.22 --> 8599.56
one another or is this real

8596.859 --> 8602.26
like I have that what about protecting

8599.56 --> 8604.92
the elderly yes absolutely but it is

8602.26 --> 8604.92
different though

8608.319 --> 8616.119999999999
because protecting the elderly is really

8612.1 --> 8616.12
for the family right

8619.12 --> 8625.18
if you're if a family doesn't protect

8622.12 --> 8627.04
their own Elder that often means that

8625.18 --> 8630.04
the Elder either doesn't have a family

8627.04 --> 8632.26
or we're a real bastards

8630.04 --> 8635.26
when they weren't old yet

8632.26 --> 8638.380000000001
so I'm a little bit more careful with

8635.26 --> 8639.28
elderly but as a as a general rule of

8638.38 --> 8642.399
thumb

8639.28 --> 8644.92
yeah protect your elders it's like don't

8642.399 --> 8647.5
like oh we need to save some Financial

8644.92 --> 8649.24
costs I'll just euthanize the Elder yeah

8647.5 --> 8652.42
no [ __ ] way

8649.24 --> 8654.819
no the others are important but it's

8652.42 --> 8657.34
also important that they

8654.819 --> 8661.779999999999
really work on maintaining their mental

8657.34 --> 8663.819
faculties and actually you like do

8661.78 --> 8666.28
something with that wisdom

8663.819 --> 8669.1
actually you're old yeah you're getting

8666.28 --> 8671.26
crippled you might not be all there but

8669.1 --> 8673.54
you have wisdom [ __ ] use it before

8671.26 --> 8676.66
you're gone I mean that's what you're

8673.54 --> 8678.580000000002
getting old for to collect wisdom so you

8676.66 --> 8681.039999999999
can give insights that younger people

8678.58 --> 8685.06
simply can't get

8681.04 --> 8686.92
use it yeah now that the person must use

8685.06 --> 8689.859
their elderliness they must use their

8686.92 --> 8692.439
elderly wisdom they must find a way to

8689.859 --> 8695.08
basically trick the younger into

8692.439 --> 8697.359
listening to them

8695.08 --> 8700.359
and not just so that they get attention

8697.359 --> 8703.960000000001
but to pass on real serious wisdom that

8700.359 --> 8706.960000000001
only the oldest of people can attain

8703.96 --> 8709.479
or have attained have assimilated have

8706.96 --> 8711.58
worked through so that they know

8709.479 --> 8713.92
with certainty instead of with

8711.58 --> 8715.899
uncertainty

8713.92 --> 8718.359
all right so yeah protecting your Elder

8715.899 --> 8720.88
as a general rule but it doesn't bring

8718.359 --> 8722.92
out that berserk Instinct like

8720.88 --> 8725.22
protecting women and children thus

8722.92 --> 8725.22
though

8725.979 --> 8730.24
although I mean if I'd be with my dad

8728.2 --> 8732.640000000001
and somebody would hurt my dad I'd

8730.24 --> 8734.52
[ __ ] break their limbs man I'd break

8732.64 --> 8739.72
their [ __ ] limbs but that's because

8734.52 --> 8741.939
of the personal bond with my dad and

8739.72 --> 8743.8
and especially because of the road of

8741.939 --> 8745.359
recovery because I I used to kind of

8743.8 --> 8747.399
hate my dad

8745.359 --> 8749.380000000001
when I was a teen because I thought he

8747.399 --> 8751.358999999999
was weak

8749.38 --> 8753.88
and that really made me despise a lot

8751.359 --> 8756.880000000001
about him and he's become so much

8753.88 --> 8759.519999999999
stronger so I have more

8756.88 --> 8762.46
even more investment because he's he

8759.52 --> 8764.439
became better okay and that's a rare

8762.46 --> 8766.539999999999
luxury

8764.439 --> 8768.34
that's a very rare luxury most people

8766.54 --> 8770.26
that

8768.34 --> 8773.14
found out their dad sucks or whatever

8770.26 --> 8776.979
they don't get better

8773.14 --> 8779.279999999999
later mine did and I feel very lucky to

8776.979 --> 8779.279999999999
have him

8779.92 --> 8782.58
so yeah

8796.42 --> 8802.359
anyway hope you're all enjoying the show

8799.12 --> 8805.479000000001
it's extra expanded show

8802.359 --> 8808.859
on a Monday because there's no fed live

8805.479 --> 8808.858999999999
hope you're all enjoying it

8824.74 --> 8829.899
what I did a global girl no

8827.74 --> 8832.439
not if they're actually fanatical about

8829.899 --> 8835.899
it not gonna date any [ __ ]

8832.439 --> 8837.939
astrophysicist that kind of [ __ ]

8835.899 --> 8839.68
I mean if they like the globe or

8837.939 --> 8842.979000000001
whatever they like fantasy of space

8839.68 --> 8846.04
that's fine if they're gonna be like no

8842.979 --> 8848.019999999999
we're really usable yeah then [ __ ] off

8846.04 --> 8850.960000000001
then

8848.02 --> 8852.58
go reproduce with some

8850.96 --> 8855.22
soy boy

8852.58 --> 8858.899
gay ass

8855.22 --> 8858.899
if you believe so much in your ball

8860.319 --> 8865.18
and then you can deal with your gay

8862.24 --> 8868.199999999999
children then yourself because

8865.18 --> 8868.2
it's not a ball

8870.44 --> 8875.08
[Music]

8872.319 --> 8878.019999999999
and people that are really allowed all

8875.08 --> 8881.74
about the ball they usually end up

8878.02 --> 8884.52
really being tolerant to [ __ ] too

8881.74 --> 8887.69
and I'm not

8884.52 --> 8887.69
[Music]

8914.68 --> 8919.74
about Consciousness people my wisdom

8919.78 --> 8925.439
all right

8921.399 --> 8925.439
seems like crazy talk to them

8926.62 --> 8932.26
well yeah I mean perhaps before swines

8928.96 --> 8936.3
but there's always those in between that

8932.26 --> 8936.300000000001
can actually appreciate it

8936.64 --> 8940.619999999999
so

8938.08 --> 8940.62
you know

8941.859 --> 8947.979000000001
don't focus on the Wasps just look focus

8944.859 --> 8950.2
on the bees right

8947.979 --> 8952.72
don't complain about the Wasps be happy

8950.2 --> 8955.92
about the bees

8952.72 --> 8955.92
that's how I see it

8956.62 --> 8961.84
right and the more people are low

8958.84 --> 8963.939
Consciousness and wasted

8961.84 --> 8967.3
like and your wisdom is wasted to them

8963.939 --> 8969.460000000001
the more precious the ones it is not

8967.3 --> 8971.679999999998
wasted on they come

8969.46 --> 8975.099999999999
becomes even more precious

8971.68 --> 8977.56
to them because if your wisdom is not

8975.1 --> 8979.899000000001
appreciated by most then that means that

8977.56 --> 8983.319
the people that will appreciate it will

8979.899 --> 8984.939
know how rare it is and they will

8983.319 --> 8987.279999999999
appreciate it even more because they

8984.939 --> 8989.399
have to face all those idiots too you

8987.28 --> 8989.399000000001
see

8990.22 --> 8992.938999999998
so

8993.46 --> 8997.858999999999
it's never really wasted on everybody

9002.34 --> 9004.819
hmm

9006.3 --> 9012.358999999999
so she would at least I don't even know

9009.66 --> 9014.84
if I'd be doing a daily flatter shows at

9012.359 --> 9014.84
depe

9017.88 --> 9023.819
I don't know if I'll ever like

9021.12 --> 9026.660000000002
get in a relationship in this setup I

9023.819 --> 9026.66
don't know if I will

9027.12 --> 9031.640000000001
watch penalty yes thank you

9058.5 --> 9063.84
right but the yeah whether she doesn't

9060.84 --> 9065.880000000001
necessarily need to accept a daily flood

9063.84 --> 9067.439
or a show but she needs to accept that

9065.88 --> 9070.019999999999
the Earth is flat

9067.439 --> 9072.899
because

9070.02 --> 9074.880000000001
she's gonna have to be able to answer

9072.899 --> 9076.858999999999
questions to the kids when they're very

9074.88 --> 9079.619999999999
little you see

9076.859 --> 9081.960000000001
if she's gonna be oh here's the globe oh

9079.62 --> 9084.54
but your dad thinks it's flat or you

9081.96 --> 9086.16
could listen to your dad like that's not

9084.54 --> 9088.26
gonna [ __ ] happen

9086.16 --> 9090.899
that will not happen

9088.26 --> 9094.399
in a family of mine they're gonna have

9090.899 --> 9094.399
to know the Earth is flat

9103.13 --> 9109.819
[Music]

9105.26 --> 9109.819
eight years but that's fine

9115.56 --> 9120.24
no seven technically 2016.

9129.899 --> 9133.56
New Jersey what the [ __ ] are you talking

9132.3 --> 9135.84
about

9133.56 --> 9138.779999999999
what do you think all women in the world

9135.84 --> 9141.5
are ballers you're [ __ ] [ __ ]

9138.78 --> 9141.5
really

9141.96 --> 9147.199999999999
you really think that

9144.12 --> 9147.2
you're pathetic

9147.66 --> 9154.76
there's plenty of Flat Earth women out

9150.18 --> 9154.76
there they just don't care for it

9161.46 --> 9166.74
well why don't you learn how to type

9163.92 --> 9168.6
first Moxie before you make judgment

9166.74 --> 9171.3
about whether there's women out there

9168.6 --> 9173.78
that believe the Earth is flat or not

9171.3 --> 9173.779999999999
all right

9179.64 --> 9183.858999999999
Nathan's wife isn't into Effie

9184.439 --> 9190.74
what does that have to do with it

9187.5 --> 9193.859
I mean she knows it's flat

9190.74 --> 9195.899
I mean she's seen all the entire

9193.859 --> 9198.720000000001
argumentation of her husband you think

9195.899 --> 9200.88
that Nathan's wife isn't watching dude

9198.72 --> 9201.899
Nathan's wife is watching my show I

9200.88 --> 9203.88
don't know if she still does but

9201.899 --> 9204.899
apparently she followed even my show

9203.88 --> 9206.64
yeah

9204.899 --> 9209.519999999999
she will know

9206.64 --> 9212.699999999999
that doesn't mean that she likes to talk

9209.52 --> 9215.12
about it and face ballers in a

9212.7 --> 9218.58
discussion yeah

9215.12 --> 9221.220000000001
definitely don't need a wife that is

9218.58 --> 9223.02
like wanting to debate Ballers or

9221.22 --> 9225.72
something okay

9223.02 --> 9230.640000000001
Siri they just need you to know

9225.72 --> 9234.0
ball is a crazy satanic delusion and

9230.64 --> 9239.699999999999
that she knows that there are logical

9234.0 --> 9241.56
and empirical arguments to prove that

9239.7 --> 9244.380000000001
she can accept that

9241.56 --> 9248.72
it's all good she doesn't have to argue

9244.38 --> 9252.42
anything about it leave that to me

9248.72 --> 9255.0
watching does not need to know is that

9252.42 --> 9259.28
she's not gonna polarize against me when

9255.0 --> 9259.28
it comes to her kids about the subject

9259.38 --> 9262.399
that's important

9266.5 --> 9269.709
[Music]

9284.78 --> 9290.52
very practical yeah

9290.52 --> 9297.300000000001
[Music]

9294.26 --> 9301.7
yes what was the tops I don't know

9297.3 --> 9301.699999999999
but there's no Fed so it seems

9304.859 --> 9310.08
right but there's no fvd at least at the

9307.02 --> 9311.58
regular time but uh Nathan might later

9310.08 --> 9314.34
show up

9311.58 --> 9315.96
and do like a members only stream that

9314.34 --> 9319.14
will go live at some point I don't know

9315.96 --> 9321.3
or he might not but I'm pretty sure that

9319.14 --> 9323.099999999999
whatever happens Nathan's not going to

9321.3 --> 9324.899
be having a live every day tomorrow

9323.1 --> 9327.359
because tomorrow

9324.899 --> 9329.279999999999
his daughter's birthday Eleanor's

9327.359 --> 9332.880000000001
birthday so

9329.28 --> 9335.84
there might be an fpd stream later

9332.88 --> 9335.839999999998
but not now

9344.04 --> 9347.76
not all kids have the same belief as

9346.319 --> 9350.479
their parents

9347.76 --> 9350.479
I don't care

9351.6 --> 9359.939
as long as they know how it works yeah

9354.66 --> 9362.7
you see I'm not a flat earther I know

9359.939 --> 9365.1
all about Flat Earth arguments I will

9362.7 --> 9366.380000000001
talk about why it's what no no I can

9365.1 --> 9369.78
literally

9366.38 --> 9371.819
reconstruct baller psychology and like

9369.78 --> 9374.819000000001
being a ball I can literally do that

9371.819 --> 9376.56
yeah if my kid would be like but what if

9374.819 --> 9379.26
it's the ball then I'm like

9376.56 --> 9380.64
okay well I got I got enough of that you

9379.26 --> 9384.18
want to know everything about the ball

9380.64 --> 9384.899
you wanna outball the wizard nerds out

9384.18 --> 9387.359
there

9384.899 --> 9391.619999999999
here's how you do it yeah I'll make him

9387.359 --> 9393.359
the most competent ball argumenter in

9391.62 --> 9395.640000000001
the [ __ ] world

9393.359 --> 9399.359
if they wanted to

9395.64 --> 9401.34
but I would tell him that it's only the

9399.359 --> 9404.76
arguments are that good

9401.34 --> 9407.16
because the Earth is flat and you know

9404.76 --> 9410.1
it is you want to be the best baller

9407.16 --> 9414.3
ever well you got to be a flat earther

9410.1 --> 9418.2
in order to accomplish that like I did

9414.3 --> 9421.199999999999
and that's what I have to offer my kids

9418.2 --> 9422.460000000001
you want to be a master at this

9421.2 --> 9424.92
well

9422.46 --> 9426.57
I'm here I can teach you I've been doing

9424.92 --> 9429.69
it all my life

9426.57 --> 9429.69
[Music]

9435.41 --> 9438.628999999999
[Music]

9446.58 --> 9451.62
right so hey a kid wants to believe that

9449.16 --> 9454.14
it's a baller they can but I will

9451.62 --> 9458.460000000001
[ __ ] tell them

9454.14 --> 9462.0
how I know the Earth is is flat I will

9458.46 --> 9464.938999999998
tell them and then they can ignore that

9462.0 --> 9467.939
until they keep bumping their heads

9464.939 --> 9469.800000000001
until a sacrifice is effectively made in

9467.939 --> 9472.319
order for them to realize that they were

9469.8 --> 9474.119999999999
wrong all this time and that I was right

9472.319 --> 9475.979
and that that sucks that they're gonna

9474.12 --> 9478.140000000001
have to live with it because what is

9475.979 --> 9480.92
right is right it doesn't matter at what

9478.14 --> 9480.92
person it comes

9481.74 --> 9489.539999999999
the person doesn't make the truth or

9485.88 --> 9492.479
rely it is the information

9489.54 --> 9495.02
that is the truth or rely no matter who

9492.479 --> 9495.019999999999
it comes from

9498.0 --> 9503.399
something that I had to learn

9500.88 --> 9506.099999999999
because I had a long strong personal

9503.399 --> 9508.68
bias about how I assimilated information

9506.1 --> 9511.02
based on who it came from

9508.68 --> 9512.34
and in retrospect that was a really poor

9511.02 --> 9514.439
decision

9512.34 --> 9516.66
for me to do that tactically and I

9514.439 --> 9518.34
stopped doing it now I don't care about

9516.66 --> 9519.3
the person I only care about the

9518.34 --> 9521.76
information

9519.3 --> 9524.099999999999
when it comes to information but that

9521.76 --> 9527.399
took some time for me to get there I had

9524.1 --> 9529.880000000001
to like see how catastrophic that other

9527.399 --> 9532.68
way of assembling

9529.88 --> 9535.92
assimilating information really was I

9532.68 --> 9538.62
had to undergo the catastrophe of it to

9535.92 --> 9541.319
realize that and let it go

9538.62 --> 9543.6
so yeah my kids probably gonna be

9541.319 --> 9547.319
brilliant and they're gonna have to make

9543.6 --> 9551.24
a lot of [ __ ] mistakes just to refine

9547.319 --> 9551.24
their wisdom like I had to

9560.76 --> 9568.74
I know

9564.06 --> 9571.619999999999
Global that all depends on what school

9568.74 --> 9573.06
there it completely depends on what

9571.62 --> 9574.92
school

9573.06 --> 9580.699999999999
what community

9574.92 --> 9580.7
there's no 99 99 chance at all

9589.26 --> 9597.899
yeah nobody's gonna glow BFI my kid yeah

9594.42 --> 9599.22
nobody will do that or I will [ __ ] them

9597.899 --> 9603.0
up

9599.22 --> 9606.56
yeah my little kids are my domain and

9603.0 --> 9606.56
you will not do anything

9611.58 --> 9618.56
[Music]

9614.66 --> 9618.56
no I didn't watch that

9618.78 --> 9623.66
I think why did you send that

9625.38 --> 9632.759999999998
oh wait yeah you sent that a while ago

9629.7 --> 9635.78
I haven't actually watched the video

9632.76 --> 9635.78
it's home Barnett

9637.38 --> 9643.039999999999
but this is some fractal math array or

9640.38 --> 9643.039999999999
not isn't it

9643.56 --> 9646.16
hmm

9651.06 --> 9656.06
it's hard to teach Gildan how to feel

9653.1 --> 9661.52
blow BS no it's not hard to filter that

9656.06 --> 9661.519999999999
if they don't face it there it

9661.68 --> 9668.58
yeah

9663.06 --> 9672.479
you can ensure that they don't face it

9668.58 --> 9674.28
you know how you do it you don't have a

9672.479 --> 9678.24
television

9674.28 --> 9680.899000000001
you don't give your children iPhones or

9678.24 --> 9680.899
iPads

9680.939 --> 9686.359
yeah

9682.14 --> 9686.358999999999
it's not difficult turret

9689.58 --> 9697.439
you just have to deprive yourself of all

9693.3 --> 9702.14
these things that will shove globes in

9697.439 --> 9702.14
your face it's not that difficult dude

9703.319 --> 9707.34
but yeah if you're gonna give your kid

9705.18 --> 9708.960000000001
like oh whoa you just stay over with

9707.34 --> 9710.7
them

9708.96 --> 9712.438999999998
and you're not gonna instruct them like

9710.7 --> 9714.060000000001
no Globe stuff yeah then they're gonna

9712.439 --> 9715.800000000001
get Globe stuff in their [ __ ] in their

9714.06 --> 9717.0
face and now like Oh Daddy Daddy so look

9715.8 --> 9718.92
over the Earth there's a glove yeah

9717.0 --> 9720.96
that's what [ __ ] happens when you let

9718.92 --> 9722.58
your kids just roam around with other

people without knowing what the [ __ ]

9722.58 --> 9728.819
they're into yeah that's what happens

9724.62 --> 9731.04
and that's why you shouldn't do that

9728.819 --> 9733.019999999999
yeah because if you just let your kid

9731.04 --> 9736.080000000002
wander around in this wild wild world

9733.02 --> 9737.939
yes they will get Globe obsessed because

9736.08 --> 9740.46
that's what happens with little kids

9737.939 --> 9743.18

measuring itself geometry and Celestial

go [ __ ] yourself and believe it's a

9884.1 --> 9888.899000000001
globe and get on a rocket and [ __ ]

9887.34 --> 9892.26
kill yourself or whatever you're gonna

9888.899 --> 9894.899
do I don't care it's flat I don't care

9892.26 --> 9897.68
if you don't believe it's flat I don't

9894.899 --> 9897.68
care

9902.12 --> 9906.899000000001
[Music]

9904.08 --> 9908.88
yeah I want to believe it's a globe you

9906.899 --> 9911.358999999999
believe it's a [ __ ] Globe yeah you

9908.88 --> 9914.039999999999
can believe that people are Gods too

9911.359 --> 9916.74
even though the Lord they rest upon

9914.04 --> 9918.6
tells you that's not the case and you'll

9916.74 --> 9920.039999999999
still do it because people want to

9918.6 --> 9922.2
believe whatever they want to believe

9920.04 --> 9925.02
and if it's [ __ ] and it makes no

9922.2 --> 9927.479000000001
sense they're still gonna do it because

9925.02 --> 9930.24
they wanna and they don't care it

9927.479 --> 9932.16
doesn't make any sense so I don't care

9930.24 --> 9934.68
if you don't care it doesn't make any

9932.16 --> 9937.08
sense and I don't care to convince you

9934.68 --> 9941.220000000001
at all

9937.08 --> 9945.68
yeah I'm like oh you want to rot in hell

9941.22 --> 9945.679999999998
well then go rot in hell

9945.72 --> 9949.319
you do it

9947.64 --> 9951.65
yeah

9949.319 --> 9955.189999999999
I'm doing something else

9951.65 --> 9955.19
[Music]

9957.68 --> 9966.139000000001
[Music]

9966.72 --> 9970.64
unless you usually for that

9971.1 --> 9974.18
it's all stupid

9974.34 --> 9983.58
the Earth is flat it's measurably flat

9978.08 --> 9987.06
measuring only works because it's flat

9983.58 --> 9990.359
Celestial navigation only works because

9987.06 --> 9994.14
it's flat it's flat it can't be anything

9990.359 --> 9997.52
other than flat or nothing would work

9994.14 --> 10000.319
even now in the attempts to globalify

9997.52 --> 10002.62
Celestial navigation and all these

10000.319 --> 10002.619999999999
things

10002.66 --> 10009.619999999999
even now with computers and Ai and

10007.04 --> 10014.78
everything that's available the Ballers

10009.62 --> 10017.359
still can't get it to work okay

10014.78 --> 10019.460000000001
you still can't get it to work

10017.359 --> 10021.2
yeah so

10019.46 --> 10023.599999999999
it doesn't work

10021.2 --> 10025.399000000001
if you can't get it to work on a globe

10023.6 --> 10027.62
with all the technological assistance

10025.399 --> 10029.358999999999
then how the hell would it have ever

10027.62 --> 10031.52
worked ever

10029.359 --> 10033.859
without all that technological

10031.52 --> 10036.26
assistance how the [ __ ] would they've

10033.859 --> 10039.34
ever have figured it out they couldn't

10036.26 --> 10043.64
have because you can't because you can't

10039.34 --> 10047.24
Celestial navigate on a globe it doesn't

10043.64 --> 10049.099999999999
work it will never work geometry doesn't

10047.24 --> 10052.1
work on the globe

10049.1 --> 10053.960000000001
nothing works on the globe the Earth is

10052.1 --> 10056.6
in the globe it can't be a glow because

10053.96 --> 10059.66
we've done things and we have things

10056.6 --> 10062.899000000001
available to us that can't work on a

10059.66 --> 10065.479
globe so it is in the globe and I don't

10062.899 --> 10068.18
care to prove to you that it is in the

10065.479 --> 10070.88
globe there's already enough things in

10068.18 --> 10072.800000000001
the world that prove it can't be a globe

10070.88 --> 10076.24
and if you don't want to hear about that

10072.8 --> 10076.24
then go [ __ ] yourself

10077.42 --> 10087.04
foreign

10077.97 --> 10087.039999999999
[Music]

10099.74 --> 10105.439
it's flat

10101.96 --> 10107.839999999998
it can only be flat the Earth can only

10105.439 --> 10110.84
be flat there's no other option

10107.84 --> 10113.54
architecturally

10110.84 --> 10116.78
that is available

10113.54 --> 10119.899000000001
to do anything or form anything it has

10116.78 --> 10122.439
to be flat it's the only logical durable

10119.899 --> 10122.439
design

10131.54 --> 10137.800000000001
yeah no Maps no navigation if it's not

10135.439 --> 10137.800000000001
flat

10138.859 --> 10146.42
there's only flat all flat all of it all

10143.54 --> 10148.160000000002
the Earth all of it's perfectly flat

10146.42 --> 10150.859
perfectly level

10148.16 --> 10152.24
uniform

10150.859 --> 10154.1
flat

10152.24 --> 10157.42
that's what it is it's what it will

10154.1 --> 10157.42
always be and it always was

10158.13 --> 10161.31
[Music]

10163.42 --> 10169.04
yeah 90 degree angles you know why that

10166.46 --> 10171.38
exists why there are such a things as

10169.04 --> 10173.899000000001
angles and 90 degree angles and why

10171.38 --> 10175.279999999999
there's four 90 degree angles in a

10173.899 --> 10178.599999999999
circle yeah

10175.28 --> 10178.6
because it's flat

10184.12 --> 10191.720000000001
no 90 no flat it's flat we got a 90. we

10189.2 --> 10194.92
got a 90 degree angle in relation to the

10191.72 --> 10194.92
Earth it's flat

10197.96 --> 10203.06
yeah

10199.34 --> 10207.92
angle pure Zenith angle of the horizon

10203.06 --> 10207.92
flat 90 degrees flat

10208.1 --> 10210.939
deal with it

10212.58 --> 10215.78
[Music]

10230.06 --> 10233.96
right anyway I think I'm gonna round out

10232.819 --> 10237.88
the show I've been going for almost

10233.96 --> 10237.88
three hours on a Monday ha

10238.399 --> 10243.74
starting an hour late isn't that just

10241.28 --> 10246.140000000001
hilarious

10243.74 --> 10248.0
all right so yeah today definitely ended

10246.14 --> 10251.06
up talking about transforming magical

10248.0 --> 10253.34
thinking into fractal thinking

10251.06 --> 10254.899
I did address it could have been more

10253.34 --> 10259.04
elaborate more detail but I think that

10254.899 --> 10261.68
we went in a lot to a lot of detail

10259.04 --> 10263.84
and a bit of nostalgia diet back I

10261.68 --> 10266.2
really I want to watch Captain power

10263.84 --> 10266.2
again

10267.68 --> 10273.380000000001
now I await

10270.56 --> 10276.38
I did watch it like what is it now three

10273.38 --> 10278.599999999999
years ago for a bit

10276.38 --> 10280.699999999999
and if you haven't actually watched any

10278.6 --> 10282.68
of it you should definitely like like

10280.7 --> 10284.6
watch it watch it

10282.68 --> 10289.12
Watch What Happens it's better than

10284.6 --> 10289.12
you'd expect it to be it really is

10297.62 --> 10302.42

so I'll be back tomorrow with flat Earth

10331.34 --> 10335.6
early bird number 1671 oh look at the

10334.64 --> 10339.34
Sun

10335.6 --> 10339.34
oh a little bit of sun that's nice

10350.24 --> 10354.8
so I'll be back tomorrow another Flat

10352.64 --> 10357.5
Earth early bird they're probably not

10354.8 --> 10360.438999999998
going to be a live fvd today but there

10357.5 --> 10362.72
might be like much later when just for

10371.779 --> 10376.34
with a ruby fpd but I mean there will be

10374.66 --> 10378.68
a flat Earth early bird

10376.34 --> 10380.18
and I don't know I might be starting in

10378.68 --> 10381.92
late too tomorrow I don't know if

right

10386.6 --> 10390.68
but I I will definitely be back tomorrow

10389.0 --> 10392.24
