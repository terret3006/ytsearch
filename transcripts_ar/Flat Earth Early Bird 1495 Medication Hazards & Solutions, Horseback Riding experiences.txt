8.58 --> 39.869
foreign

9.99 --> 39.869
[Music]

52.879 --> 57.92

85.5 --> 91.619
right

86.7 --> 94.10000000000001
so whether today is beautiful

91.619 --> 94.1
still

96.479 --> 100.619
look at the Blue Sky

98.52 --> 104.28
a couple of

100.619 --> 106.5
sheepy looking clouds

104.28 --> 108.92
but a lot of blue sky and nice bright

106.5 --> 108.92
Sun

110.399 --> 114.02
now my camera can't get there

116.579 --> 120.439
all right it's really nice

121.079 --> 123.55999999999999
okay

130.86 --> 136.44000000000003
all right

133.459 --> 138.06
still a bit chilly though

136.44 --> 138.98
but probably a little warmer than

138.06 --> 142.44
yesterday

138.98 --> 144.66
hello LSG first in chat good to see you

142.44 --> 146.9
happy weekend yeah happy weekend to you

144.66 --> 146.9
too

147.42 --> 153.54
it is Saturday the 28th of January 2023

157.98 --> 164.06
okay

160.34 --> 164.06
January is almost over

169.44 --> 172.099
huh

172.379 --> 177.25
right

174.66 --> 180.32999999999998
what is the temperature

177.25 --> 180.33
[Music]

181.26 --> 188.16
six degrees all right

185.099 --> 189.42
yeah according to the prediction the

188.16 --> 192.78
forecast

189.42 --> 196.7
it's gonna be like between six and eight

192.78 --> 196.7
in the next in the coming week so

197.099 --> 203.659
with clouds and Rain though but not

200.099 --> 203.659
severe rain so we'll see

204.959 --> 207.14000000000001
all right

209.459 --> 214.22
so yeah I went to bed kind of late

214.739 --> 220.14000000000001
but I'm still okay

217.14 --> 222.72
because I haven't been drinking or

220.14 --> 223.92
there or tea

222.72 --> 226.379
right

223.92 --> 228.23899999999998
but it's kind of funny to like be

226.379 --> 231.35999999999999
reminded of what that actually feels

228.239 --> 234.9
like when you go to bed really late the

231.36 --> 239.04000000000002
next day but without some kind of

234.9 --> 242.299
alcohol influencer because yeah I mean

239.04 --> 244.5
if I because I think I went to sleep

242.299 --> 247.5
effectively went to sleep like five

244.5 --> 251.34
o'clock I went to bed like a little over

247.5 --> 254.28
four but still it was way too late

251.34 --> 258.979
but I'm still okay

254.28 --> 258.979
normally I would probably skip the show

259.019 --> 264.079
like if this would have been a month ago

265.03 --> 268.85999999999996
[Music]

266.4 --> 270.59999999999997
so that's kind of interesting

268.86 --> 272.58000000000004
not that I'm gonna make a habit of it

270.6 --> 275.04
mind you

272.58 --> 279.5
but yeah I mean every time something

275.04 --> 279.5
happens I'm gonna take notes

280.979 --> 285.3
even if it seems like an eventful

284.1 --> 288.18
foreign

285.3 --> 290.699
or just negative right I mean every

288.18 --> 292.919
crisis is an opportunity

290.699 --> 295.44
it's kind of funny that that's purely

292.919 --> 298.44
associated with uh was it that said it

295.44 --> 298.44
enriquezinger

299.1 --> 304.639
most people know it through Alex Jones's

302.16 --> 304.639
end game

304.74 --> 310.8
I did

306.06 --> 313.259
but it's just true but he meant it

310.8 --> 316.139
on a macro scale on a societal

313.259 --> 319.74
engineering skill and oh

316.139 --> 322.46000000000004
like that but I take it on a very

319.74 --> 322.46000000000004
personal level

322.68 --> 327.419
it's like every mistake is an

325.38 --> 328.78
opportunity it's an opportunity to

327.419 --> 330.06
understand what's going on

328.78 --> 333.13899999999995
[Music]

330.06 --> 333.139
instead of just

333.68 --> 340.259
resigning to it and like that just

336.6 --> 341.58000000000004
happens you can actually just analyze it

340.259 --> 346.16
like

341.58 --> 346.15999999999997
try to analyze it honestly and and

347.16 --> 352.38000000000005
to try to stop avoiding it

350.34 --> 353.69899999999996
that that's gonna get in the way at

352.38 --> 355.38
first

353.699 --> 357.3
but you got to just push through it

355.38 --> 361.44
because like you gotta

357.3 --> 365.94
you won't grip over it or not

361.44 --> 368.4
right and sometimes certain habits

365.94 --> 373.44
turn out to

368.4 --> 377.84
not not just be a problem

373.44 --> 377.84
like for example cannabis use for me

378.479 --> 384.479
like everybody's always treated me with

381.479 --> 385.979
that like oh you're a drug user right

384.479 --> 388.139
but

385.979 --> 390.84
very early on I started to discover

388.139 --> 394.039
already that it just

390.84 --> 394.039
it Alters

396.9 --> 402.9
very subtle Little Things

399.3 --> 405.96000000000004
that just make it very easy for me to

402.9 --> 408.29999999999995
keep to get more focused when it comes

405.96 --> 411.68
to Dreaming

408.3 --> 411.68
in a constructive way

412.139 --> 420.02
right so that's why I've kind of held on

414.539 --> 420.02
to it and I've at like what is it

421.039 --> 427.979
five years complete reprieve

424.44 --> 430.259
in between and it yeah I mean

427.979 --> 432.419
that just

430.259 --> 434.699
it kind of cleared me up for a bit was a

432.419 --> 436.62
good contrast really and I needed to do

434.699 --> 439.139
that really

436.62 --> 441.24
because I wasn't having proper control

439.139 --> 443.34000000000003
back in the day

441.24 --> 444.3
it was kind of miserable especially at

443.34 --> 445.56
first

444.3 --> 448.44
but

445.56 --> 452.36
I just noticed

448.44 --> 452.36
that like yeah I

455.099 --> 461.28
I just dream less

457.8 --> 463.759
and I kind of become not depressed but

461.28 --> 463.75899999999996
just like

468.539 --> 474.02
like content but with lit less impulses

474.24 --> 479.419
like I tone it down even more so

480.36 --> 482.36
um

489.479 --> 496.02
like when I don't smoke like I'll be a

493.139 --> 498.72
completely different person

496.02 --> 500.52
not completely I mean it'll still be me

498.72 --> 505.16
but I just

500.52 --> 505.15999999999997
I won't work the way I normally work

505.919 --> 509.24
for good or for bad

515.159 --> 519.779
I think I'd actually focus more on

517.38 --> 523.32
Earthly things

519.779 --> 525.42
if I didn't smoke really

523.32 --> 529.1600000000001
I would have less care for this sort of

525.42 --> 529.16
thing I would have much less patience

529.86 --> 537.54
especially the patients that is required

533.82 --> 541.2600000000001
to sit sit it through

537.54 --> 544.8
like realizing that a lot of people

541.26 --> 546.959
either don't fully get it

544.8 --> 550.76
and like they're not destined to get it

546.959 --> 553.7399999999999
or that I'm being caged in in some way

550.76 --> 556.14
so that people just don't

553.74 --> 558.32
get to know me they don't know I'm out

556.14 --> 558.3199999999999
there

567.66 --> 572.16
or another weird third option in my mind

570.72 --> 574.8000000000001
is that

572.16 --> 576.6
maybe I'm just so freaking aberrant that

574.8 --> 579.92
people just don't know how to approach

576.6 --> 579.9200000000001
me here online

588.92 --> 593.959
all right anyway hello gaining wisdom

591.36 --> 593.9590000000001
good to see you

596.399 --> 599.66
I'm kind of rambling

600.66 --> 606.56
oh yeah in the meantime my roommate is

603.06 --> 606.56
having a birthday party downstairs

607.05 --> 612.3
[Music]

608.64 --> 615.18
but yeah good spirits there so

612.3 --> 616.78
I have no objections there's a babbling

615.18 --> 619.5
from downstairs

616.78 --> 621.48
[Music]

619.5 --> 623.16
pretty sure they're not gonna like play

621.48 --> 626.839
music loud or anything

623.16 --> 626.8389999999999
maybe in the evening

637.14 --> 642.959
right hey metal slugs Masters yeah

640.14 --> 645.92
indeed it works great for some and not

642.959 --> 645.92
great for others

652.97 --> 655.5
[Music]

654.3 --> 657.779
right

655.5 --> 658.8
so if you're like a very expressive

657.779 --> 661.86
person

658.8 --> 663.959
or you're like

661.86 --> 667.14
creative

663.959 --> 669.5999999999999
with music then especially with music

667.14 --> 672.66
but other stuff too you'll be much more

669.6 --> 674.82
drawn towards cannabis although it can

672.66 --> 678.06
still like ruin you you can overdo it

674.82 --> 679.8000000000001
and then it actually suppresses

678.06 --> 682.38
right

679.8 --> 685.38
I've seen that happen too

682.38 --> 687.36
but yeah if you're not if you're like

685.38 --> 688.62
very stoic

687.36 --> 691.5
right

688.62 --> 693.779
very down to earth with how you go about

691.5 --> 695.339
then it's really disrupting Factor

693.779 --> 697.4399999999999
because it's like all your senses are

695.339 --> 700.0400000000001
going to play up that you normally try

697.44 --> 700.0400000000001
to suppress

700.079 --> 705.959
so yeah like my brother tried it one

703.86 --> 707.82
time somewhere in his teens and it was a

705.959 --> 710.2199999999999
nightmare to him and he's like I'll

707.82 --> 713.5790000000001
never do that he hated it from that

710.22 --> 715.14
point like really hated it

713.579 --> 719.2199999999999
like it

715.14 --> 721.8
if I was smoking like my brother refused

719.22 --> 722.82
to be around me like even if it was

721.8 --> 724.68
outside

722.82 --> 727.1600000000001
like he didn't want to have anything to

724.68 --> 727.16
do with that

729.06 --> 732.18
like my mother did not have that issue

730.92 --> 735.8
at all

732.18 --> 735.8
and she was smoking herself

738.0 --> 743.7
and my dad too sometimes but my mom was

741.18 --> 746.6999999999999
basically smoking a lot more eventually

743.7 --> 746.7
right

747.6 --> 754.94
but yeah some people just

749.899 --> 754.94
they really hate it and fear it

755.04 --> 759.959
because I think it would like when they

758.339 --> 762.24
experienced that

759.959 --> 764.16
they get this they get to see senses

762.24 --> 766.5
that they just don't deal with they

764.16 --> 768.48
don't go to that state so it's extremely

766.5 --> 770.76
uncomfortable to them they don't have a

768.48 --> 774.019
designation for it

770.76 --> 774.019
they don't know what to do with it

774.959 --> 777.92
that's data B

778.279 --> 783.959
well for me it was a revelation like

786.54 --> 793.04
I was looking for that state of being

789.12 --> 793.04
for a very long time I felt

794.94 --> 799.9200000000001
[Music]

796.92 --> 803.76
right because before I got to know about

799.92 --> 806.399
cannabis which was like when I was 15. I

803.76 --> 809.519
hated smoking like I really hated it and

806.399 --> 814.44
was like fanatical anti-smoker like

809.519 --> 817.04
as a kid I used to like hide the smokes

814.44 --> 820.5600000000001
of my parents because they

817.04 --> 822.7199999999999
like we're smokers

820.56 --> 825.56
at the start and they eventually like

822.72 --> 825.5600000000001
quit tobacco

827.82 --> 833.5790000000001
entirely around somewhere around my what

830.76 --> 835.26
it was when I was 12 or something but

833.579 --> 837.0
then at 15

835.26 --> 838.62
that they were still smoking cannabis

837.0 --> 840.72
but they were keeping it a secret and

838.62 --> 842.399
then when they found out that I tried it

840.72 --> 844.5790000000001
when it was 50 and they were like oh

842.399 --> 847.279
okay so

844.579 --> 849.7199999999999
we don't have to withhold that anymore

847.279 --> 852.0
necessarily because they thought it

849.72 --> 854.519
would be risky

852.0 --> 857.04
to show me that

854.519 --> 857.62
and so then like oh okay now they were

857.04 --> 859.26
just gonna

857.62 --> 861.9590000000001
[Music]

859.26 --> 864.779
like we're cannabis smokers here and

861.959 --> 866.6999999999999
that's by the way also I didn't at the

864.779 --> 868.38
time I didn't really see it

866.7 --> 870.3000000000001
but that's also when my brother

868.38 --> 872.42
basically decided to get out of the

870.3 --> 872.42
house

878.399 --> 883.339
he wouldn't have any of that

880.92 --> 883.3389999999999
around

884.459 --> 888.5
YouTube right anyway

897.42 --> 904.68
oh makes you unable to maintain Focus

901.68 --> 908.579
well for me it was just

904.68 --> 911.579
just pure being overwhelmed

908.579 --> 914.279
but also like the first experience was

911.579 --> 917.8389999999999
actually good and interesting

914.279 --> 917.8389999999999
it was really magical

919.62 --> 922.339
in a way

923.22 --> 928.62
but but very oversensitive I mean if

926.22 --> 930.779
somebody would have like

928.62 --> 933.3
startled me because they thought it was

930.779 --> 935.04
funny or something while it was that I

933.3 --> 937.26
would have probably

935.04 --> 939.5999999999999
had like severe nightmares and all that

937.26 --> 941.22
because it would just make me so

939.6 --> 943.38
sensitive

941.22 --> 944.4590000000001
but thank God like nothing really bad

943.38 --> 946.62
happened

944.459 --> 949.6389999999999
and I figured out that it was that it

946.62 --> 949.639
made me very sensitive

954.839 --> 957.32
anyway

959.279 --> 964.26
because

960.72 --> 966.4200000000001
also it also provided kind of like a

964.26 --> 968.04
blanket of protection on top of the

966.42 --> 970.74
sensitivity but that blanket of

968.04 --> 972.779
protection has basically most of it has

970.74 --> 975.6
gone away

972.779 --> 979.1
that's kind of worn off because I'm

975.6 --> 979.1
using so regularly

980.04 --> 986.579
but at first there was like this thick

982.399 --> 989.22
cushy blanket just that wouldn't really

986.579 --> 991.4399999999999
ruin anything unless somebody got really

989.22 --> 993.9200000000001
aggressive but maybe even then it would

991.44 --> 993.9200000000001
just like

994.92 --> 999.12
even the blanket might have protected me

996.779 --> 1002.86
in retrospect so maybe my analysis from

999.12 --> 1002.86
like five minutes ago I'm slightly off

1002.959 --> 1008.7199999999999
but yeah that blanket as I call it an

1005.839 --> 1011.5600000000001
ethereal blanket of cushiness and just

1008.72 --> 1011.5600000000001
yay

1012.259 --> 1016.1800000000001
it does kind of wear off

1019.16 --> 1024.639
but the other effects don't

1022.04 --> 1024.639
anyway

1027.74 --> 1034.04
false information about cannabis right

1030.38 --> 1038.74
well look it's also because of

1034.04 --> 1038.74
there's no proper way of dealing with it

1039.38 --> 1046.3390000000002
right from society like from Psychiatry

1043.16 --> 1047.8390000000002
and all that so they just the only thing

1046.339 --> 1050.059
they ever do is like oh that's like

1047.839 --> 1052.76
psychosis risk that's the only thing

1050.059 --> 1056.4189999999999
really they say about it

1052.76 --> 1058.4
although some therapists even

1056.419 --> 1060.0200000000002
yeah they don't necessarily have to be

1058.4 --> 1063.02
that alternative they will recognize

1060.02 --> 1065.66
like yeah it does relax somebody

1063.02 --> 1067.6399999999999
some people just use it to relax and

1065.66 --> 1070.0
wind like other people would drink beer

1067.64 --> 1070.0
or something

1072.5 --> 1075.1
but

1075.26 --> 1081.02
yeah but I mean

1077.419 --> 1083.24
technically like Psychiatry isn't to

1081.02 --> 1084.74
accommodate for people figuring

1083.24 --> 1087.94
themselves out

1084.74 --> 1087.94
when they're dripping

1089.48 --> 1093.919
I think most psychiatrists when you

1091.46 --> 1096.559
basically go to them and pay them and

1093.919 --> 1099.5590000000002
are just like telling about your drug

1096.559 --> 1103.7
trip experiences that eventually they

1099.559 --> 1106.34
they just cancel but maybe these days

1103.7 --> 1108.14
they'll let just like oh if you pay you

1106.34 --> 1111.6399999999999
can just do whatever you want as long as

1108.14 --> 1111.64
no violence involved or

1111.679 --> 1116.3200000000002
I don't know how that works out there

1113.9 --> 1116.3200000000002
now

1123.08 --> 1130.0
I think a lot of people most people just

1126.08 --> 1130.0
find friends to talk to

1131.299 --> 1135.7
that's how I see it happen all the time

1143.059 --> 1145.6
anyway

1145.64 --> 1149.5
the most damage traveler good to see you

1170.48 --> 1175.039
all right

1172.46 --> 1176.419
but we cannabis with me it's kind of

1175.039 --> 1180.2
weird

1176.419 --> 1182.2990000000002
because a lot of people like use it for

1180.2 --> 1184.5800000000002
pain relief

1182.299 --> 1186.76
but with me it doesn't work like that at

1184.58 --> 1186.76
all

1186.98 --> 1194.059
it it would only be acute pain relief if

1190.58 --> 1196.52
I was like so stressed out

1194.059 --> 1199.46
that it's like the pain would directly

1196.52 --> 1202.1
caused by stressing out and because it

1199.46 --> 1204.38
would force me by just using it to just

1202.1 --> 1206.24
let go of that that that does always

1204.38 --> 1209.0590000000002
happen

1206.24 --> 1211.34
and if that was the direct instantaneous

1209.059 --> 1214.76
cause of some kind of pain then that

1211.34 --> 1216.4599999999998
will stop that pain but like when I'm

1214.76 --> 1218.059
just hurting somewhere

1216.46 --> 1221.32
then

1218.059 --> 1221.32
it doesn't help

1221.9 --> 1229.8200000000002
although it can help with being more

1226.16 --> 1231.74
easily like tuned into a distraction of

1229.82 --> 1233.6
some kind so if I'm doing something if

1231.74 --> 1235.7
I'm reading something if I'm watching a

1233.6 --> 1238.2199999999998
video or playing a game

1235.7 --> 1241.3400000000001
then cannabis does help me Zone in more

1238.22 --> 1243.8600000000001
so that I could basically forget if I

1241.34 --> 1245.299
have some kind of ailment somewhere

1243.86 --> 1248.78
but

1245.299 --> 1252.02
when I don't do that it actually makes

1248.78 --> 1253.1789999999999
me more aware of it and more of a

1252.02 --> 1259.299
nuisance

1253.179 --> 1259.299
it doesn't just like oh the Pain's gone

1260.419 --> 1267.1000000000001
but again that might be because I might

1262.58 --> 1267.1
because I'm a regular smoker

1267.88 --> 1273.2
what do I do for a living

1271.1 --> 1275.6
I do a YouTube show called The Flat

1273.2 --> 1278.6000000000001
Earth early bird show

1275.6 --> 1280.52
and I'm active

1278.6 --> 1282.98
around

1280.52 --> 1287.9189999999999
in the Flat Earth scene

1282.98 --> 1287.919
especially Nathan Oakley and comrades

1289.28 --> 1294.82
and I studied people and social media

1298.76 --> 1304.34
and I'm an orator I talk about a lot of

1301.7 --> 1306.5800000000002
things and I can't talk about a lot of

1304.34 --> 1309.8799999999999
things big things too

1306.58 --> 1309.8799999999999
esoteric things

1310.52 --> 1313.6
ethereal things

1314.48 --> 1320.9
I have a rigorous discipline when it

1317.84 --> 1323.059
comes to sizing up conceptions and their

1320.9 --> 1324.26
place within the akashic library of

1323.059 --> 1327.1399999999999
knowledge

1324.26 --> 1329.86
which I am

1327.14 --> 1334.2800000000002
poorly compared to the original

1329.86 --> 1338.059
simulating and building over my lifetime

1334.28 --> 1340.46
to size up how things really are

1338.059 --> 1343.1
and I can use that and I like to give

1340.46 --> 1345.5
advice to people

1343.1 --> 1347.6589999999999
if they want it

1345.5 --> 1350.24
because I think I get very good advice

1347.659 --> 1353.24
and I'm getting better as I go and other

1350.24 --> 1354.6200000000001
people around me that like to hang

1353.24 --> 1357.08
around also

1354.62 --> 1358.3999999999999
happen to have like good advice type

1357.08 --> 1361.76
knowledge

1358.4 --> 1366.0800000000002
and so we can all share that so provide

1361.76 --> 1368.72
I'm a host I provide a ground

1366.08 --> 1372.58
where people can come together

1368.72 --> 1372.58
if it's kind of convenient to them

1373.82 --> 1377.1399999999999
and share thoughts

1378.38 --> 1384.64
and even share a bit of Our Lives if

1381.08 --> 1384.6399999999999
there's nobody else to talk to

1385.159 --> 1390.4
we really need to vent something

1388.82 --> 1393.5
right

1390.4 --> 1397.7800000000002
that's what I do for a living is that a

1393.5 --> 1397.78
good answer Gillies Gosling

1400.59 --> 1403.81
[Music]

1407.48 --> 1411.529
[Music]

1416.48 --> 1421.6
that's potent strain

1419.0 --> 1425.14
[Music]

1421.6 --> 1425.1399999999999
I'll pull back

1426.44 --> 1428.6200000000001
okay

1429.02 --> 1435.039
well sir Casey look I don't want

1432.02 --> 1435.039
stronger strains

1436.76 --> 1441.2
I've had them

1438.679 --> 1443.659
they give me like

1441.2 --> 1446.179
they seriously like

1443.659 --> 1451.0390000000002
like throw me out of it

1446.179 --> 1454.52
they disrupt my my spiritual balance

1451.039 --> 1457.22
they're like an assault on my spirit

1454.52 --> 1460.4
does that really strong type cannabis

1457.22 --> 1463.46
it's really bad for me

1460.4 --> 1466.159
it destabilizes me

1463.46 --> 1468.2
now the Cannabis that I take is much

1466.159 --> 1470.48
stronger compared to what was available

1468.2 --> 1473.3600000000001
in the 90s

1470.48 --> 1476.6
or what I grew

1473.36 --> 1478.52
but it's not even close to like how

1476.6 --> 1480.4399999999998
strong their some cannabis is out there

1478.52 --> 1485.12
and I don't want it I don't want

1480.44 --> 1488.24
stronger and I'm not gonna want stronger

1485.12 --> 1490.039
I just want

1488.24 --> 1493.34
just the right

1490.039 --> 1495.62
level of influence

1493.34 --> 1498.6789999999999
and this is it

1495.62 --> 1502.58
and I can do with less too

1498.679 --> 1504.94
right because I don't need to like

1502.58 --> 1508.28
get some oh

1504.94 --> 1510.46
like a hit on the head I don't like that

1508.28 --> 1510.46
effect

1512.6 --> 1517.6399999999999
well I used to like it when I was not

1515.84 --> 1521.36
disciplined at all and it didn't matter

1517.64 --> 1523.22
right I would just like throw my spirit

1521.36 --> 1525.86
around

1523.22 --> 1528.14
like whatever

1525.86 --> 1531.9799999999998
now I can't afford to do that anymore

1528.14 --> 1535.659
and it's pointless I know what I like

1531.98 --> 1535.659
that's been fulfilled

1538.4 --> 1542.9
I don't need to there's nothing more I

1540.38 --> 1545.5390000000002
can learn from doing that I just lose

1542.9 --> 1547.94
more right I don't want

1545.539 --> 1551.02
I just want this

1547.94 --> 1551.02
not too strong

1551.36 --> 1557.12
just a nice taste

1554.12 --> 1557.12
foreign

1577.34 --> 1581.6
or maybe yeah just not I don't use that

1580.58 --> 1584.059
much

1581.6 --> 1586.4599999999998
like even with these joints I use it

1584.059 --> 1589.24
like as if it's really strong because it

1586.46 --> 1589.24
kind of still is

1590.6 --> 1595.3999999999999
now if I have like that really super

1592.94 --> 1597.679
strong type [ __ ] the knee I could like

1595.4 --> 1601.1000000000001
oh do little 80 bits but it's still

1597.679 --> 1603.5
gonna have the destabilizing effect

1601.1 --> 1606.8799999999999
it's just too strong it doesn't matter

1603.5 --> 1606.88
how little of it I take

1612.2 --> 1620.0
but even in the joints that I roll like

1615.32 --> 1622.9399999999998
I don't really use a lot every time

1620.0 --> 1625.7
that way I can kind of smoke throughout

1622.94 --> 1629.6000000000001
the day like multiple joints

1625.7 --> 1632.059
but they're not really that big

1629.6 --> 1634.6999999999998
like I may be like compared to like the

1632.059 --> 1635.6
the coffee shop prefab joints that they

1634.7 --> 1639.0800000000002
sell

1635.6 --> 1640.6399999999999
for like three Euros to five euros

1639.08 --> 1643.6399999999999
each

1640.64 --> 1646.5200000000002
my joints have like

1643.64 --> 1650.48
a quarter to a third of the amount of

1646.52 --> 1654.46
cannabis in it that they put in there

1650.48 --> 1654.46
and my joints are pretty small anyway

1655.22 --> 1657.82
so

1658.52 --> 1664.279
yeah

1660.86 --> 1667.8799999999999
for me that whole thing like oh more and

1664.279 --> 1670.96
more and more to get the kick right

1667.88 --> 1670.96
I'm not doing that

1671.059 --> 1675.1399999999999
I couldn't do that I can't afford to do

1673.58 --> 1678.02
that

1675.14 --> 1680.3600000000001
and it would ruin me like

1678.02 --> 1684.26
my spirit

1680.36 --> 1686.24
and I can't afford that either

1684.26 --> 1687.86
so both financially and spiritually

1686.24 --> 1689.98
that's just something I'm not going to

1687.86 --> 1689.9799999999998
do

1691.64 --> 1698.0
if cannabis becomes dissatisfactory in

1695.24 --> 1701.32
taking it this way then my alternative

1698.0 --> 1701.32
would be to just stop

1702.86 --> 1705.1
before

1706.52 --> 1713.6
and like do a reset

1710.059 --> 1717.5
for a while and then like I did with my

1713.6 --> 1719.7199999999998
ex at the end try it out again if I feel

1717.5 --> 1721.88
like I'm really stuck like my spirit is

1719.72 --> 1724.64
all gooey and I just have a little

1721.88 --> 1727.22
Dynamic left

1724.64 --> 1729.7990000000002
and I took it and it's like whoa opening

1727.22 --> 1731.419
up again and getting really creative

1729.799 --> 1733.82
juices flowing all of a sudden again

1731.419 --> 1735.98
that it really kind of stood still

1733.82 --> 1739.0
that's what it did when I first tried it

1735.98 --> 1739.0
after a long time

1741.76 --> 1745.179
the five years

1748.52 --> 1755.799
but yeah that did also then start to

1751.88 --> 1755.7990000000002
kind of transform the way I am again

1756.34 --> 1760.6589999999999
I could not be a stoic anymore

1761.659 --> 1766.3990000000001
because I was pretty stoic and it was

1764.299 --> 1767.299
kind of necessary with my ex too but

1766.399 --> 1769.9399999999998
yeah

1767.299 --> 1773.6
I'm not gonna go into that

1769.94 --> 1775.64
not everything is about that Arwen

1773.6 --> 1778.58
it's freaking 10 years ago Let It Go

1775.64 --> 1780.679
already no I have Let It Go but it's

1778.58 --> 1784.22
just there's so much that happened back

1780.679 --> 1786.26
then that I'm still learning from now

1784.22 --> 1788.84
that I can actually look back at it

1786.26 --> 1793.419
without just feeling I lost it all

1788.84 --> 1793.4189999999999
because that really haunted me for like

1794.36 --> 1799.2199999999998
six years

1796.22 --> 1803.02
and at first it was so bad I really like

1799.22 --> 1803.02
had to continually look away

1805.0 --> 1811.7
like just to not think about it right I

1808.52 --> 1814.399
really suffer under that sort of thing

1811.7 --> 1817.22
but now I can look back and like see all

1814.399 --> 1820.4189999999999
these things that happen and like whoa

1817.22 --> 1820.419
I can learn from it

1822.38 --> 1827.3200000000002
right and I'm not like complaining right

1825.26 --> 1830.12
I'm not oh

1827.32 --> 1831.74
no no I'm just like oh this situation

1830.12 --> 1834.3799999999999
that situation this is what happened oh

1831.74 --> 1837.5
that is how things changed

1834.38 --> 1839.98
I'm just analyzing it

1837.5 --> 1839.98
anyway

1844.82 --> 1849.1399999999999
extract some paper yeah there's all

1847.1 --> 1851.84
kinds of weird things

1849.14 --> 1853.7
this resin

1851.84 --> 1855.9189999999999
vaporizer

1853.7 --> 1858.38
they got they got that over at the shop

1855.919 --> 1859.8200000000002
I tried that one time I think I told you

1858.38 --> 1863.5
about it and then

1859.82 --> 1864.74
like I almost fell off my feet

1863.5 --> 1866.96
[Music]

1864.74 --> 1869.74
I wasn't that was just not funny it was

1866.96 --> 1869.74
way too strong

1877.039 --> 1881.6589999999999
and I don't want that I I said like wow

1879.919 --> 1883.5800000000002
that feels like I'm 17 again and they

1881.659 --> 1886.96
were like oh yeah yeah and I'm like yeah

1883.58 --> 1890.1789999999999
I don't want to feel like I was 70 again

1886.96 --> 1893.26
that kind of sucked in retrospect I

1890.179 --> 1893.26
don't need that back

1897.799 --> 1904.48
but amazing that that exists I guess for

1901.76 --> 1904.48
those that do

1905.48 --> 1908.32
uh

1915.62 --> 1921.8799999999999
I mean I bet for some like veteran

1918.2 --> 1924.559
smokers yeah you if you do if you keep

1921.88 --> 1928.159
going for that you can basically hang

1924.559 --> 1930.5
around with like new younger smokers

1928.159 --> 1933.0800000000002
because you can stay kind of on the same

1930.5 --> 1935.0
experience level

1933.08 --> 1939.279
so I get it

1935.0 --> 1939.279
but for me that's not how I smoke

1946.039 --> 1948.82
I don't know

1949.1 --> 1954.08
I don't know like smoked a joint with

1951.62 --> 1958.58
anybody else for

1954.08 --> 1961.899
years now last the last was with uh

1958.58 --> 1961.899
Dutch sailor

1962.72 --> 1967.6000000000001
who now thinks I'm evil or something

1970.58 --> 1973.12
anyway

1982.52 --> 1986.96
upside of high potency is that you're

1984.919 --> 1988.5200000000002
smoking you're smoking less

1986.96 --> 1991.52
no

1988.52 --> 1991.52
exactly

1995.899 --> 1997.899
okay

1999.44 --> 2004.96
yeah I mean you're bypassing my point

2002.62 --> 2006.2199999999998
there for Casey but maybe that worked

2004.96 --> 2008.919
for you

2006.22 --> 2012.1000000000001
but again for me even smoking less it

2008.919 --> 2016.2
would still disrupt

2012.1 --> 2016.1999999999998
my yeah my focus and my spirit

2017.32 --> 2022.5
I just don't want that

2019.299 --> 2022.5
I can't afford that

2022.659 --> 2026.0390000000002
like adding a problem

2034.12 --> 2038.309
what

2035.18 --> 2038.309
[Music]

2043.6 --> 2046.1999999999998

2151.359 --> 2155.2799999999997
it's unbearable yeah yeah oh so

2155.68 --> 2161.6189999999997
is something that could stop the pain is

2159.16 --> 2165.7599999999998
shooting yourself in the head too you

2161.619 --> 2168.88
know I mean yeah or you just

2165.76 --> 2172.2000000000003
don't risk doing something crazy like

2168.88 --> 2172.2000000000003
taking fentanyl ever

2179.74 --> 2182.3999999999996
I mean

2186.64 --> 2194.3799999999997
I just I yeah I I don't even want to

2190.8 --> 2197.38
tell people the risks

2194.38 --> 2199.359
of getting a fentanyl in your life even

2197.38 --> 2202.48
just by getting it prescribed by a

2199.359 --> 2205.2599999999998
doctor for some pain you have like

2202.48 --> 2207.82
there you you will

2205.26 --> 2209.8590000000004
underestimate the risks not just of

2207.82 --> 2212.2000000000003
accidentally

2209.859 --> 2215.02
Miss dosing or something right that's

2212.2 --> 2216.2799999999997
already in your face no that's not just

2215.02 --> 2218.079
it

2216.28 --> 2221.7400000000002
you see

2218.079 --> 2224.579
you're marked if you're known to take

2221.74 --> 2224.5789999999997
Fentanyl

2225.28 --> 2228.0
yeah

2228.22 --> 2232.18
and somebody

2229.96 --> 2236.619
wants to get rid of you

2232.18 --> 2239.16
you suddenly made it really really easy

2236.619 --> 2239.1600000000003
for them

2241.06 --> 2243.66
do you understand

2248.02 --> 2250.98
never

2251.099 --> 2255.82
accept it

2253.839 --> 2259.9
from your doctor

2255.82 --> 2263.92
or from some pusher whatever never

2259.9 --> 2266.94
accept it stay away from people that

2263.92 --> 2266.94
have that

2267.88 --> 2273.6400000000003
you I mean that's with that [ __ ] you can

2270.46 --> 2276.88
very easily get poisoned to death

2273.64 --> 2280.66
very easily guys

2276.88 --> 2282.1600000000003
stay away from it stay away from people

2280.66 --> 2285.8199999999997
that have it

2282.16 --> 2289.98
sorry I mean yeah

2285.82 --> 2289.98
it's just it's so dangerous

2290.079 --> 2292.32
foreign

2295.18 --> 2300.72
right and because accidents happen so

2298.06 --> 2300.72
much with it

2302.02 --> 2308.94
it's it's just dangerous it's dangerous

2306.099 --> 2308.94
to be around it

2312.46 --> 2316.14
uh sorry man getting wisdom

2316.839 --> 2321.66
just the daily

2319.0 --> 2321.66
for

2325.06 --> 2327.42
eign

2328.18 --> 2331.18
Sanford

2336.3 --> 2342.2400000000002
I just can't get

2338.859 --> 2342.24
and to know to make sense

2343.24 --> 2350.64
it well it's just extreme pain relief

2346.54 --> 2350.64
medication but it's super dangerous

2352.839 --> 2357.5789999999997
foreign

2354.88 --> 2360.28
I mean seriously where they actually

2357.579 --> 2362.2000000000003
produce medication with that

2360.28 --> 2366.6400000000003
and have to deal with its purest form

2362.2 --> 2368.98
it's like working with nitroglycerinomas

2366.64 --> 2371.68
they are so [ __ ] careful with that

2368.98 --> 2373.54
stuff because the concentrated form is

2371.68 --> 2374.68
like

2373.54 --> 2378.339
just

2374.68 --> 2381.22
one little Grain on your skin

2378.339 --> 2384.7
accidentally dissolving in your [ __ ]

2381.22 --> 2384.7
dead okay

2385.0 --> 2388.74
it's so [ __ ] up

2392.06 --> 2396.2999999999997
[Music]

2397.3 --> 2402.76
in its pure form it is considered a

2400.9 --> 2406.6600000000003
hazardous

2402.76 --> 2408.1600000000003
chemical like extremely dangerous

2406.66 --> 2409.7799999999997
because it is

2408.16 --> 2412.1189999999997
lethal

2409.78 --> 2415.44
it could be classified under like

2412.119 --> 2415.44
chemical warfare

2418.119 --> 2427.079
it it might be I don't know it should be

2422.92 --> 2427.079
that stuff is freaking dangerous man

2441.16 --> 2446.16
okay RJ

2443.32 --> 2446.1600000000003
[ __ ] is that

2455.09 --> 2459.339
[Music]

2456.339 --> 2459.339
foreign

2475.599 --> 2482.2200000000003
but yeah getting wisdom

2478.359 --> 2482.22
I think I understand and what happened

2482.74 --> 2488.14
if it worked and it was feeling better

2484.96 --> 2489.88
then he had a probably a manic face

2488.14 --> 2492.4
where he got a little bit more Reckless

2489.88 --> 2495.48
without realizing it and then he

2492.4 --> 2495.48
probably overdosed

2498.46 --> 2504.099
I think that

2500.8 --> 2505.9
probably happens a lot

2504.099 --> 2508.56
because that stuff is extremely

2505.9 --> 2508.56
impactful

2528.339 --> 2530.52
thank you

2532.44 --> 2536.26
wmd yeah

2534.82 --> 2538.54
arguably

2536.26 --> 2540.3390000000004
arguably Couture Casey that's not

2538.54 --> 2543.9
strange

2540.339 --> 2543.9
that's not a weird thing to say

2549.54 --> 2554.04
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

2556.42 --> 2559.8
that's [ __ ]

2560.56 --> 2565.54
although I don't know man maybe like in

2562.96 --> 2569.46
California somewhere

2565.54 --> 2569.46
but I've never heard of that

2576.76 --> 2581.619
or maybe not California I mean they just

2579.28 --> 2583.78
have like shops and all that they would

2581.619 --> 2585.6400000000003
never get be caught doing that

2583.78 --> 2589.7400000000002
so that's going to be like a street

2585.64 --> 2589.74
dealer situation so where it's illegal

2591.28 --> 2597.76
you grow your own okay cool

2593.859 --> 2600.94
well look if some

2597.76 --> 2603.28
uh yeah some cannabis store in

2600.94 --> 2607.78
California or something right if they

2603.28 --> 2610.8390000000004
would if somebody would be caught dead

2607.78 --> 2614.92
like with stuff

2610.839 --> 2619.24
like that it would be traced dude that

2614.92 --> 2622.1800000000003
guy is going to go to jail for life

2619.24 --> 2624.3999999999996
so yeah whoever was running the store

2622.18 --> 2626.74
there or whoever is turning out to be

2624.4 --> 2629.44
there's just no way

2626.74 --> 2631.06
so that's got to be in places where it's

2629.44 --> 2633.52
illegal and you can only get it through

2631.06 --> 2635.56
Street dealers

2633.52 --> 2637.18
it's not going to be my problem let's

2635.56 --> 2639.339
just say because here there's coffee

2637.18 --> 2641.2599999999998
shops dude if they'd be caught doing

2639.339 --> 2646.96
that

2641.26 --> 2648.28
they have well yeah they go to jail Max

2646.96 --> 2651.2400000000002
probably

2648.28 --> 2651.2400000000002
foreign

2666.599 --> 2671.099
they can't do that it doesn't work

2671.619 --> 2678.1600000000003
you can't just

2673.48 --> 2683.04
spray it on cannabis that is because the

2678.16 --> 2683.04
chances of overdosing is Extreme

2684.76 --> 2690.4
you're not gonna get people hooked on

2687.88 --> 2692.6400000000003
fentanyl by secretly spraying it on

2690.4 --> 2692.64
stuff

2693.4 --> 2696.54
that makes no sense

2702.48 --> 2706.2
it's too dangerous

2707.02 --> 2711.94
it's like either it doesn't work at all

2709.72 --> 2715.24
or it works

2711.94 --> 2717.76
but if you smoke a little bit too much

2715.24 --> 2721.0
of that then then suddenly it becomes

2717.76 --> 2723.7200000000003
lethal very quickly like dude it's

2721.0 --> 2723.72
intainable

2723.76 --> 2727.96
it's the way today you that's like just

2726.28 --> 2730.119
immediately you're gonna create victims

2727.96 --> 2733.619
they this doesn't work you can't make

2730.119 --> 2733.619
people addicted to it like that

2734.98 --> 2740.7
that's [ __ ] advertised oh oh really

2745.78 --> 2750.9
they don't know they're getting hot that

2747.94 --> 2750.9
doesn't make any sense

2753.18 --> 2759.8999999999996
dude you will know if you're having

2757.18 --> 2759.8999999999996
fentanyl

2765.04 --> 2770.94
because it's like a totally different

2767.319 --> 2770.94
experience from cannabis

2771.04 --> 2775.98
it's not [ __ ] it's too dangerous

2776.98 --> 2783.579
you don't seem to understand fentanyl RJ

2781.06 --> 2786.18
so yeah have a nice day with your

2783.579 --> 2786.1800000000003
[ __ ]

2811.48 --> 2816.54
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

2813.22 --> 2816.54
Orangefield how do you know

2820.48 --> 2823.48
foreign

2830.819 --> 2835.5
death what the [ __ ] are you talking

2833.26 --> 2835.5
about

2838.96 --> 2842.64
different types oh really

2844.18 --> 2849.18
that's obvious get the [ __ ] out of here

2846.339 --> 2849.18
you [ __ ]

2853.3 --> 2861.42
how [ __ ] dare you shut the [ __ ] up

2856.96 --> 2861.42
Man's brother just died you [ __ ]

2883.9 --> 2890.2000000000003
another stupid fake ass suck

2887.5 --> 2892.42
trying to poke at everybody here like

2890.2 --> 2895.2599999999998
why are they just [ __ ] why are they

2892.42 --> 2895.26
doing that

2905.73 --> 2908.909
[Music]

2910.9 --> 2915.819
right but anyway

2913.3 --> 2919.96
I'm gonna do the stupid routine thingy

2915.819 --> 2922.54
again before you ever find out that our

2919.96 --> 2923.619
win was found dead from a fentanyl

2922.54 --> 2927.099
overdose

2923.619 --> 2928.42
you can be sure as hell that I was

2927.099 --> 2935.04
poisoned

2928.42 --> 2935.04
because I swear I will never take it

2937.54 --> 2943.18
unless like yeah I'm being tortured or

2940.78 --> 2945.76
something physically literally

2943.18 --> 2950.0789999999997
in secreted then like yeah who gives a

2945.76 --> 2951.6400000000003
[ __ ] like dying whatever you know

2950.079 --> 2953.38
but

2951.64 --> 2957.04
in my

2953.38 --> 2959.5
still somewhat self-destinate destined

2957.04 --> 2962.74
life where I can choose things I will

2959.5 --> 2966.7
never choose it I will choose suffering

2962.74 --> 2970.319
and isolation in agony physically over

2966.7 --> 2970.319
that if I have to

2972.579 --> 2981.2400000000002
right so just for the record

2975.7 --> 2981.24
I'm never taking fentanyl no matter what

2985.119 --> 2988.319
let it be known

2997.599 --> 3000.26
foreign

3013.859 --> 3016.859
types

3020.819 --> 3024.7799999999997
yeah Georgetown for I mean it might be

3022.56 --> 3027.42
they might have had have fabricated

3024.78 --> 3029.3390000000004
other chemical forms of it

3027.42 --> 3031.52
that works slightly different and all

3029.339 --> 3031.52
that

3034.44 --> 3040.619
but I mean there is no variety of

3037.079 --> 3044.6600000000003
fentanyl where you don't risk

3040.619 --> 3044.6600000000003
like dying from an overdose

3044.7 --> 3051.359
right I mean if you take a lot of

3047.52 --> 3053.16
aspirin yeah you'll have a terrible time

3051.359 --> 3055.319
but you're probably not gonna die from

3053.16 --> 3058.0789999999997
that unless you have already pretty bad

3055.319 --> 3059.04
conditions and and stable metabolism and

3058.079 --> 3062.819
all that

3059.04 --> 3065.88
right but I mean even with some soft

3062.819 --> 3068.94
variety of fentanyl I bet that if you

3065.88 --> 3071.6400000000003
just take a little bit or well like

3068.94 --> 3074.7000000000003
three times what you should you'll

3071.64 --> 3077.339
probably still risk dying from it even

3074.7 --> 3081.74
with the soft variety I mean that stuff

3077.339 --> 3081.74
in general is just very dangerous

3086.09 --> 3089.489
[Music]

3104.819 --> 3110.0589999999997
what okay getting wisdom okay what

3114.78 --> 3118.8590000000004
has a warrant

3116.46 --> 3121.46
what the hell

3118.859 --> 3121.46
okay

3135.48 --> 3140.3
are you just is that just a figure of

3137.94 --> 3140.3
speech

3144.359 --> 3149.24
probably not

3146.7 --> 3149.24
anyway

3172.079 --> 3175.079
foreign

3183.68 --> 3187.98
traffic tickets okay

3188.339 --> 3191.7
what they really give out a warrant for

3190.74 --> 3194.4199999999996
that

3191.7 --> 3194.4199999999996
wow

3200.7 --> 3206.0589999999997
oh wow

3202.74 --> 3206.0589999999997
wow it's beautiful out there

3212.16 --> 3218.5989999999997
the moon is out

3215.119 --> 3218.599
you see it

3219.359 --> 3223.52
sir what

3221.099 --> 3223.52
okay

3224.7 --> 3230.7799999999997
I can see the moon right there but why

3227.4 --> 3230.78
isn't the camera picking it up

3233.76 --> 3238.38
can you guys see the moon

3236.4 --> 3243.1800000000003
it

3238.38 --> 3245.579
I am okay why can't you see it

3243.18 --> 3248.54
I can see it right there

3245.579 --> 3248.54
with my eyes

3251.119 --> 3256.38
there's uh I think there's a little dot

3253.74 --> 3261.319
there or something

3256.38 --> 3261.319
wow the Moon is really not picking up

3262.339 --> 3267.7799999999997
with this webcam

3265.14 --> 3270.02
How Bizarre

3267.78 --> 3270.02
foreign

3270.26 --> 3276.7200000000003
yeah that dot is probably representative

3273.96 --> 3278.46
of the moon but my God that's like not

3276.72 --> 3281.339
picking it up at all

3278.46 --> 3283.68
I can see it pretty damn clearly

3281.339 --> 3287.599
with my eyes

3283.68 --> 3287.5989999999997
how incredibly bizarre

3288.48 --> 3293.48
right but yeah it's pretty beautiful out

3291.3 --> 3293.48
there

3294.98 --> 3299.7
the moon is out there but yeah the

3298.079 --> 3301.559
webcam doesn't seem to be able to pick

3299.7 --> 3304.339
it up

3301.559 --> 3304.3390000000004
okay

3309.3 --> 3313.92
you can see it

3311.04 --> 3316.44
you could see something right but I can

3313.92 --> 3317.52
see like really clear there is this half

3316.44 --> 3320.42
moon

3317.52 --> 3320.42
just like that

3323.64 --> 3328.5589999999997
right in the in like

3326.04 --> 3331.04
a really clear blue part

3328.559 --> 3331.0400000000004
anyway

3342.359 --> 3345.359
foreign

3355.94 --> 3362.9
anyway hope you guys are enjoying the

3358.92 --> 3362.9
show nice and calm one today

3363.0 --> 3371.18
don't Benjamin is all sick and all that

3367.5 --> 3371.18
got some serious bronchitis

3375.119 --> 3379.2200000000003
probably again from [ __ ] shoveling

3379.559 --> 3384.3
thank you

3381.0 --> 3386.9
without wearing a proper breathing

3384.3 --> 3386.9
protection

3388.02 --> 3392.7
because yeah that will get you a lot of

3390.72 --> 3396.24
like stuff in your lungs and that is

3392.7 --> 3398.66
gonna lead to things like bronchitis it

3396.24 --> 3398.66
really does

3411.8 --> 3414.8
foreign

3416.059 --> 3419.48
but I didn't

3424.5 --> 3430.8
I just see like this Dot

3427.559 --> 3433.1400000000003
a little white dot

3430.8 --> 3435.3590000000004
and that's it

3433.14 --> 3437.0989999999997
like when because the camera was moved

3435.359 --> 3439.5
I'm scrolling back now but because it

3437.099 --> 3441.9
was moving you could just see it there

3439.5 --> 3443.579
if I was perfectly still you wouldn't

3441.9 --> 3445.44
even pick it up

3443.579 --> 3447.599
I mean that's that doesn't look like a

3445.44 --> 3451.44
moon that's just the stupid white dot

3447.599 --> 3453.9
that's even a bit blurred

3451.44 --> 3457.46
but okay

3453.9 --> 3457.46
you can see it

3477.359 --> 3479.839
oh

3488.26 --> 3491.3590000000004
[Music]

3493.8 --> 3500.78
okay getting rich I don't know what that

3495.72 --> 3500.7799999999997
is but I take it that's fentanyl related

3501.48 --> 3506.059
what you're talking about

3503.04 --> 3506.0589999999997
a spray thing

3539.819 --> 3542.54
oh

3544.26 --> 3549.96
is it

3546.72 --> 3553.2799999999997
and today okay

3549.96 --> 3553.28
never heard of that

3563.88 --> 3569.88
right

3565.02 --> 3573.119
well in general look I don't want to uh

3569.88 --> 3576.839
I'm not a doctor but I'm gonna give you

3573.119 --> 3580.5
some basic medical advice if for some

3576.839 --> 3581.94
reason you find it feasible to get on

3580.5 --> 3585.119
Fentanyl

3581.94 --> 3587.04
you really need to well then you cannot

3585.119 --> 3590.04
be alone

3587.04 --> 3594.5
you should always have somebody with you

3590.04 --> 3594.5
in the flesh at all time

3597.2 --> 3604.9199999999996
because yeah one little accident one

3601.26 --> 3607.3190000000004
little overdose and the chances that

3604.92 --> 3609.42
you'll still be able to be conscious

3607.319 --> 3610.68
enough to quickly do something about it

3609.42 --> 3613.859
is very little

3610.68 --> 3615.66
there's gonna have to be somebody giving

3613.859 --> 3619.2599999999998
you that stuff because you're probably

3615.66 --> 3621.8999999999996
just gonna go boom passed out

3619.26 --> 3624.619
right and then you're dead

3621.9 --> 3624.619
so

3627.059 --> 3630.5
check Skype what

3634.2 --> 3636.6189999999997
oh

3643.14 --> 3645.859
okay

3648.72 --> 3653.5989999999997
I drew more phone than never even heard

3651.299 --> 3653.599
of that

3656.04 --> 3661.02
okay thanks Adam hello by the way

3659.04 --> 3664.04
I think I'll present that chart I mean

3661.02 --> 3664.04
it looks pretty interesting

3664.38 --> 3669.02
this is

3666.119 --> 3669.02
Adam meekin

3679.079 --> 3683.3590000000004
just the opioid chart

3683.88 --> 3691.579
and yeah fentanyl is

3686.599 --> 3691.579
well way at the top

3724.44 --> 3727.16
foreign

3729.5 --> 3732.68
so yeah

3735.9 --> 3742.14
because our morphine being at a one

3739.16 --> 3744.359
fentanyl between 80 and 100 times

3742.14 --> 3748.04
stronger than morphine

3744.359 --> 3748.04
I mean that's pretty freaky

3755.579 --> 3763.92
I've taken codeine in the past

3758.819 --> 3766.2599999999998
like with certain uh paracetamol

3763.92 --> 3768.599
like

3766.26 --> 3771.92
and that was always like yeah

3768.599 --> 3771.92
I mean that's doable

3773.76 --> 3778.92
whatever I don't even want to try

3776.099 --> 3781.6800000000003
morphine really

3778.92 --> 3783.359
or anything bigger than that dude and I

3781.68 --> 3787.2799999999997
don't even take the codeine it's just

3783.359 --> 3787.2799999999997
that I would probably accept it

3788.28 --> 3794.96
in radical situations

3791.94 --> 3794.96
but that's about it

3796.98 --> 3801.18
it's even rare that I'd take regular

3799.079 --> 3804.2400000000002
paracetamol against Spain and that's

3801.18 --> 3808.2799999999997
like not even on this chart

3804.24 --> 3808.2799999999997
that's not an opioid by the way so

3828.78 --> 3831.78
foreign

3859.14 --> 3864.299
um

3860.579 --> 3866.88
yeah sorry Casey I mean that makes sense

3864.299 --> 3868.46
that is that's basically used in surgery

3866.88 --> 3871.559
narcotics

3868.46 --> 3875.42
but then it's going to be they're going

3871.559 --> 3875.42
to be hyper careful with it

3876.54 --> 3881.339
like that's

3878.22 --> 3883.5589999999997
a doctor literally applying it that's

3881.339 --> 3885.24
something different as oh you just get a

3883.559 --> 3888.1800000000003
prescription and you get a bunch of

3885.24 --> 3890.04
pills and then in one stupid drunk mood

3888.18 --> 3892.44
suddenly you take two of these pills

3890.04 --> 3895.98
because you just busted the tooth or

3892.44 --> 3898.079
something right and then you die right I

3895.98 --> 3900.42
mean I'm okay with it being applied

3898.079 --> 3903.54
directly

3900.42 --> 3904.7400000000002
by doctors or surgeons respect yes

3903.54 --> 3908.16
surgery

3904.74 --> 3913.04
but it shouldn't be a consumer

3908.16 --> 3913.04
medication it shouldn't be like that

3938.16 --> 3941.0
better

3965.79 --> 3968.969
[Music]

3971.38 --> 3975.619
[Music]

3973.319 --> 3975.619
foreign

3980.0 --> 3987.18
just get paid well yeah sure but that's

3984.359 --> 3988.799
why why do they get paid well

3987.18 --> 3992.0389999999998
because

3988.799 --> 3996.119
just probably even worse than regular

3992.039 --> 3999.559
surgeons like one little tiny mistake

3996.119 --> 3999.559
and somebody's just dead

4002.24 --> 4008.72
right I mean they get paid well because

4005.119 --> 4012.819
so much rests on on the Perfection of

4008.72 --> 4012.819
their actions I'd say

4016.579 --> 4020.38
so it's mostly risk pay

4021.559 --> 4026.5
and yeah you're gonna have to have a

4023.66 --> 4026.5
really good record

4030.2 --> 4033.0389999999998
anyways

4033.14 --> 4035.799
foreign

4049.119 --> 4055.94
twice yeah sure gaining wisdom but look

4053.72 --> 4058.8799999999997
in my opinion if there's going to be

4055.94 --> 4061.76
fentanyl right out there it's not going

4058.88 --> 4065.0
to go away for some reason

4061.76 --> 4066.8590000000004
then the way to deal with it should be

4065.0 --> 4070.039
different

4066.859 --> 4074.9
you shouldn't just be allowed to just

4070.039 --> 4077.599
get a baggie of it and take it home

4074.9 --> 4079.64
you should have like base it should be

4077.599 --> 4081.1400000000003
more Incorporated it's like oh you're

4079.64 --> 4084.02
gonna take it well then you're gonna

4081.14 --> 4087.3799999999997
have to be under our supervision here

4084.02 --> 4089.18
so you can only take it in a building

4087.38 --> 4092.0
with people

4089.18 --> 4095.0789999999997
that are there to

4092.0 --> 4095.079
for emergencies

4096.02 --> 4101.540000000001
so that should be a condition in my

4098.779 --> 4103.339000000001
opinion for allowing it because if it

4101.54 --> 4104.96
really does Miracles you know well why

4103.339 --> 4108.0199999999995
would you take it away but yeah because

4104.96 --> 4110.54
of the extreme damage that it typically

4108.02 --> 4112.88
does by accident

4110.54 --> 4114.92
so it should if you take that factor

4112.88 --> 4117.259
away and just not allow it to be a

4114.92 --> 4119.359
public drug

4117.259 --> 4121.58
but

4119.359 --> 4124.819
enable

4121.58 --> 4126.739
special occasions or occasions like a

4124.819 --> 4130.04
building

4126.739 --> 4132.8589999999995
whatever where well basically a form of

4130.04 --> 4135.679
hospitalization but not exactly like

4132.859 --> 4139.279
that it's like just a place where you

4135.679 --> 4141.4400000000005
can take it to undergo That Base yeah it

4139.279 --> 4144.160000000001
would come down to like you can only

4141.44 --> 4147.379999999999
take it as part of the therapy

4144.16 --> 4149.7789999999995
procedure like in the hospital

4147.38 --> 4152.54
only under supervision

4149.779 --> 4154.279
I think that would be more sensible and

4152.54 --> 4156.98
yeah a lot of people will find it a pain

4154.279 --> 4160.339000000001
in their ass because they can

4156.98 --> 4163.218999999999
they're so confident that they can

4160.339 --> 4165.5599999999995
do it themselves yeah and yeah they will

4163.219 --> 4168.319
be until it goes wrong and then they die

4165.56 --> 4170.859
and that's the [ __ ] issue

4168.319 --> 4170.859
right

4175.339 --> 4179.259
narcam yeah gaining wisdom

4179.42 --> 4186.9800000000005
oh narcam works like come here oh okay

4183.92 --> 4188.9
oh sorry I take it back then

4186.98 --> 4191.7789999999995
but

4188.9 --> 4194.92
I thought that fentanyl does work I mean

4191.779 --> 4194.92
does it work I don't know

4195.86 --> 4200.36
I bet that any pain would be completely

4197.96 --> 4204.02
gone though

4200.36 --> 4206.66
but I don't know uh

4204.02 --> 4207.620000000001
right but that stuff narcam what you

4206.66 --> 4210.679
said

4207.62 --> 4213.0199999999995
to counter the effects of overdoses it's

4210.679 --> 4216.4400000000005
not much use if you can apply it so

4213.02 --> 4219.9800000000005
there has to be somebody there

4216.44 --> 4222.32
so maybe a solution could be being

4219.98 --> 4225.32
accompanied by a nurse or

4222.32 --> 4228.0199999999995
this gets a bit weird

4225.32 --> 4230.659
not necessarily a fan of this type of

4228.02 --> 4231.76
idea but you could have like an

4230.659 --> 4235.48
emergency

4231.76 --> 4235.4800000000005
injection bot

4235.76 --> 4240.679
Like A system that you wear on you like

4238.159 --> 4243.5599999999995
a belt or something

4240.679 --> 4247.159
or on your wrist and that

4243.56 --> 4248.780000000001
if like typical signs often overdose

4247.159 --> 4251.839999999999
start popping up

4248.78 --> 4253.639999999999
like the hearts irregular I don't know

4251.84 --> 4256.1
exactly what happens right but probably

4253.64 --> 4260.06
something like that that it just like oh

4256.1 --> 4261.92
there's this dangerous situation

4260.06 --> 4265.96
and it it

4261.92 --> 4265.96
like injects it for you

4266.239 --> 4271.099999999999
right then you don't have to have a

4268.46 --> 4274.219
person with you at all times right so

4271.1 --> 4276.26
maybe that sounds a bit weird

4274.219 --> 4279.92
but that could work

4276.26 --> 4283.58
like a bracelet with just a dose of it

4279.92 --> 4284.659
and it measures your heart situation or

4283.58 --> 4286.4
whatever

4284.659 --> 4288.92
so only wear it when you're actually

4286.4 --> 4290.659
getting fed when you're using Fentanyl

4288.92 --> 4292.159
and then if it just notices like whether

4290.659 --> 4295.28
that's going wrong

4292.159 --> 4298.48
and emergency injection

4295.28 --> 4298.48
just automatic

4301.82 --> 4309.32
right I mean that stuff narcam is not

4304.82 --> 4311.179
like dangerous to you right if you like

4309.32 --> 4313.34
take it without being on an overdose

4311.179 --> 4314.54
it's not like it's really bad for you or

4313.34 --> 4316.64
something right

4314.54 --> 4319.159
because if that would also be the case

4316.64 --> 4322.659000000001
then yeah you could then it could be a

4319.159 --> 4322.659
hazard on its own but I mean

4323.179 --> 4327.28
I think it could really work

4332.3 --> 4335.3
right

4339.56 --> 4344.7390000000005
have that on them yes I get it they have

4342.14 --> 4344.7390000000005
it on them

4346.34 --> 4350.900000000001
so that's that's handy that they can

4348.56 --> 4352.64
apply it

4350.9 --> 4354.32
two people

4352.64 --> 4357.04
right

4354.32 --> 4357.04
but

4357.739 --> 4362.959999999999
what if they're not there

4360.44 --> 4364.82
when it happens right then yeah what's

4362.96 --> 4367.52
the point

4364.82 --> 4369.739
so if you have a little system that's

4367.52 --> 4373.46
like oh you're going on fentanyl okay

4369.739 --> 4378.259999999999
well you you should wear this

4373.46 --> 4382.04
it is a narcam in like uh Autumn

4378.26 --> 4383.780000000001
automatic emergency injector for if you

4382.04 --> 4385.46
accidentally overdose and you got to

4383.78 --> 4387.58
wear it at all time even when you go to

4385.46 --> 4387.58
bed

4390.32 --> 4394.88
so you just never take it off until

4392.54 --> 4397.219
you've been green lighted to

4394.88 --> 4399.1990000000005
when you stop and then when you stop the

4397.219 --> 4401.56
medication you should probably just hand

4399.199 --> 4401.5599999999995
it in

4401.96 --> 4406.04
give it back

4403.46 --> 4410.32
not have been laying around right so

4406.04 --> 4410.32
just protocols protocols protocols

4410.659 --> 4416.0599999999995
and then yeah then you could potentially

4413.0 --> 4419.48
take it and still

4416.06 --> 4421.88
do a job or a halfway job on something I

4419.48 --> 4423.32
mean not physical at least you're not

4421.88 --> 4427.82
going to do physical heavy stuff anyway

4423.32 --> 4429.5599999999995
when you're using fentanyl right

4427.82 --> 4431.78
but that you could still just go about

4429.56 --> 4435.159000000001
and you don't need like a nurse

4431.78 --> 4435.159
following you around or something

4440.3 --> 4444.4400000000005
addict it's a safe place yeah but that's

4442.699 --> 4447.08
different though torque I see you're

4444.44 --> 4449.9
when you're talking about just addicts

4447.08 --> 4452.36
that just take it for the rush I'm just

4449.9 --> 4454.639999999999
I'm even talking about

4452.36 --> 4456.5
well people that have undergone surgery

4454.64 --> 4459.14
or have medical

4456.5 --> 4461.84
terrible problems of cancer or something

4459.14 --> 4464.42
right that go for Fentanyl

4461.84 --> 4467.3
right not talking about addicts yeah a

4464.42 --> 4469.88
good safe oversight place for druggies

4467.3 --> 4472.900000000001
well that's even already in use I mean

4469.88 --> 4472.900000000001
that's already out here

4473.12 --> 4478.64
for a heroine has been for for decades

4476.179 --> 4480.9800000000005
and that works pretty well keeps them

4478.64 --> 4483.38
off the street

4480.98 --> 4485.98
it gives them a bit of opportunity to

4483.38 --> 4485.9800000000005
get out of it

4487.28 --> 4489.88
right

4491.42 --> 4496.76
and it's I guess safer for them as well

4494.42 --> 4499.34
but

4496.76 --> 4501.5
yeah we're talk I'm I was referencing to

4499.34 --> 4503.0
just people that actually do take it as

4501.5 --> 4506.38
pain medication

4503.0 --> 4506.38
and not as as a drug

4507.199 --> 4513.32
and for those people a bracelet

4510.08 --> 4517.219
with an emergency narcam

4513.32 --> 4520.659
injector could be a solution to prevent

4517.219 --> 4520.659
accidental overdosage

4527.179 --> 4531.679
exactly Metal Slug Master that's exactly

4529.76 --> 4533.659000000001
what I'm talking yeah EpiPen type

4531.679 --> 4537.679
administrator

4533.659 --> 4539.96
dude you could go as far as like have

4537.679 --> 4542.06
Like A Pill

4539.96 --> 4544.64
even implanted under your skin

4542.06 --> 4546.4400000000005
temporarily but yeah that's not going to

4544.64 --> 4548.12
be very popular

4546.44 --> 4551.239
or maybe it will be

4548.12 --> 4553.099999999999
right that the pill just does it

4551.239 --> 4556.639999999999
inside of you that you don't even have

4553.1 --> 4560.14
to wear anything it's just like it has a

4556.64 --> 4563.6
dosage in it and then upon yeah some

4560.14 --> 4566.0
rating up your body situation

4563.6 --> 4567.14
and then it just releases upon the

4566.0 --> 4571.42
moment

4567.14 --> 4571.42
that well that it would have to be

4571.64 --> 4576.7390000000005
have a pen like that

4573.8 --> 4578.179
right yeah but still to our Casey that's

4576.739 --> 4581.9
still

4578.179 --> 4584.42
a device you would have to manually do

4581.9 --> 4589.36
something with

4584.42 --> 4589.36
and you need two people for that

4592.58 --> 4596.719
if you're on your own

4594.38 --> 4599.659000000001
and you're like oh [ __ ] I'm passing out

4596.719 --> 4602.9
quickly get my pen and then you're dead

4599.659 --> 4605.54
right that's the point that's why it's

4602.9 --> 4607.639999999999
cool that oh it can be much handier

4605.54 --> 4609.32
replied and quicker yeah but you're

4607.64 --> 4612.52
still gonna have to have a person with

4609.32 --> 4612.5199999999995
you to do that then

4621.98 --> 4624.98
foreign

4638.86 --> 4644.92
I've never heard of that

4641.719 --> 4644.92
what the hell is that

4656.239 --> 4658.54
foreign

4671.46 --> 4676.55
[Music]

4673.48 --> 4676.549999999999
[Applause]

4678.62 --> 4681.75
[Music]

4686.0 --> 4691.4
got a title for the day

4688.82 --> 4693.199
without drawing like

4691.4 --> 4696.5599999999995
unwanted attend I'm not gonna put

4693.199 --> 4698.839999999999
fentanyl in the actual title because

4696.56 --> 4701.860000000001
then it's gonna probably get categorized

4698.84 --> 4701.860000000001
with people energy

4702.44 --> 4707.719
is this our country today everybody's

4706.1 --> 4711.26
getting killed I don't want to get

4707.719 --> 4712.82
classified under that I'm just talking

4711.26 --> 4717.26
about

4712.82 --> 4720.4
well medication hazards and solutions

4717.26 --> 4720.400000000001
right I mean

4721.46 --> 4725.32
it's a good Armenian title

4725.6 --> 4731.38
I started out talking about cannabis so

4727.94 --> 4731.379999999999
it's yeah it's in general

4733.159 --> 4741.08
right issues of two strong cannabis

4737.659 --> 4743.78
how that is problematic

4741.08 --> 4745.4
and then we went on to fentanyl also

4743.78 --> 4747.44
because well gaining wisdom's brother

4745.4 --> 4750.92
died because of that

4747.44 --> 4753.739
just yesterday I mean what a shock

4750.92 --> 4757.2390000000005
not sarcasm of course

4753.739 --> 4757.239
this is freaking shocking

4758.78 --> 4762.4
I hope you'll be all right

4764.6 --> 4767.639
[Music]

4771.92 --> 4775.76
nasal spray okay

4792.4 --> 4801.5599999999995
it's an anti-convulsant for epilepsy oh

4798.56 --> 4801.56
interesting

4821.32 --> 4826.239
what what are you talking about Jane's

4823.699 --> 4826.239
favorite videos

4826.94 --> 4829.48
what

4844.52 --> 4847.06
hmm

4850.4 --> 4854.0599999999995
yeah there's good a new metal slugs

4852.26 --> 4857.5
master

4854.06 --> 4862.179
cockatiel right you're a different guy

4857.5 --> 4862.179
got multiple metal slugs people

4867.32 --> 4871.719
right but I also feel lucky that I've

4870.38 --> 4874.46
actively

4871.719 --> 4877.58
consciously avoid it

4874.46 --> 4880.64
medication very early on and it was

4877.58 --> 4882.08
quite a tragedy to see my mother

4880.64 --> 4883.64
well

4882.08 --> 4885.5
get to the point where she was just

4883.64 --> 4887.3
doing too much and it was literally

4885.5 --> 4889.1
wrecking her

4887.3 --> 4891.1990000000005
like visibly

4889.1 --> 4892.88
and like she was getting all mentally

4891.199 --> 4894.62
deranged

4892.88 --> 4896.78
it's not just because of trauma it's

4894.62 --> 4900.5
also because she was just

4896.78 --> 4903.199
throwing basically just popping [ __ ]

4900.5 --> 4906.56
popping pills all kind like

4903.199 --> 4909.0199999999995
she was just basically just desperate to

4906.56 --> 4910.64
just not be there

4909.02 --> 4913.179
everything was giving her issues

4910.64 --> 4913.179
eventually

4921.56 --> 4929.0
it was a very hard lesson because

4925.179 --> 4931.64
I could potentially have like

4929.0 --> 4934.46
pushed back against it

4931.64 --> 4938.06
to like really get on her ass and

4934.46 --> 4939.8
basically be like a father like my

4938.06 --> 4941.719
daughter has a drug problem I mean I

4939.8 --> 4943.04
could have done that

4941.719 --> 4944.2390000000005
but

4943.04 --> 4948.0199999999995
because

4944.239 --> 4950.839999999999
yeah my mother needed that

4948.02 --> 4952.159000000001
and it would work like in my earlier

4950.84 --> 4954.679
teens

4952.159 --> 4956.78
we did have moments like that

4954.679 --> 4959.42
because my mother never really had a

4956.78 --> 4960.86
father you see

4959.42 --> 4962.9
like never

4960.86 --> 4967.46
from very young on

4962.9 --> 4969.739
and that has made her weird in a way and

4967.46 --> 4972.56
she's seeking that and I kind of like at

4969.739 --> 4975.5599999999995
times took over father role but I never

4972.56 --> 4977.659000000001
really understood

4975.56 --> 4981.02
pharmaceutics

4977.659 --> 4983.599999999999
like I and even when she got cancer like

4981.02 --> 4985.64
I didn't know

4983.6 --> 4988.159000000001
I I didn't know what to tell her I

4985.64 --> 4991.360000000001
didn't know what advice I I didn't have

4988.159 --> 4991.36
a clear view on it

4991.64 --> 4996.7390000000005
so it was it was all kind of new to me

4993.92 --> 4998.9
and yeah and now I know so much more and

4996.739 --> 5002.199
God if I only had known

4998.9 --> 5004.54
that sort of stuff I could have probably

5002.199 --> 5008.879999999999
help my mother prevent from just

5004.54 --> 5008.88
becoming that deranged and dying

5009.159 --> 5016.0599999999995
but yeah I mean so afterward

5012.64 --> 5019.42
and I didn't know and maybe this

5016.06 --> 5021.659000000001
happening is what caused me to know it

5019.42 --> 5021.659
now

5025.239 --> 5030.5199999999995
and thereby I'm able to prevent that

5027.699 --> 5033.36
from happening with myself

5030.52 --> 5033.360000000001
rigidly

5036.239 --> 5041.139999999999
oh you're you are cocktail okay you just

5039.159 --> 5044.44
changed

5041.14 --> 5047.4400000000005
to master okay

5044.44 --> 5050.339999999999
now we have two accounts okay all right

5047.44 --> 5050.339999999999
good to know

5066.54 --> 5073.26
[Music]

5068.28 --> 5073.259999999999
what is that I don't know what that is

5074.38 --> 5078.4800000000005
never heard of that Jane

5090.04 --> 5092.82
oh

5093.46 --> 5096.46
oh

5096.64 --> 5101.52
my mother had that too

5098.92 --> 5101.52
actually

5103.239 --> 5108.0
yeah when the Nerf just oh God

5110.199 --> 5114.36
my mother because my mother one time

5114.46 --> 5119.44
well literally fell off a horse and

5116.8 --> 5124.14
really bad and she got a neck hernia

5119.44 --> 5124.139999999999
from that and it was literally pressing

5124.239 --> 5130.178999999999
unlike her hand nerve it was a disaster

5127.719 --> 5135.36
it was like a genuine

5130.179 --> 5135.36
disaster for her because she plays piano

5136.84 --> 5140.5
and now it hurts

5138.88 --> 5144.64
it

5140.5 --> 5147.88
like I feel guilty in a way because the

5144.64 --> 5151.54
horseback riding was my thing

5147.88 --> 5152.38
and then I I like my parents did it with

5151.54 --> 5156.42
me

5152.38 --> 5156.42
and so I feel like Ugh

5157.42 --> 5163.08
I couldn't help but feel guilty about

5159.76 --> 5163.08
that happening to my mother

5189.76 --> 5192.06
foreign

5211.32 --> 5216.48
like when I sprained my back the other

5214.239 --> 5216.48
time

5216.82 --> 5221.799999999999
in the beginning it gets kind of like

5218.98 --> 5226.799999999999
that too it is like Nerf guns of Nerf

5221.8 --> 5226.8
shock it's really it drives you nuts

5228.46 --> 5232.96
but thank God that just goes away

5230.199 --> 5234.759999999999
completely then again

5232.96 --> 5237.42
and it's mostly just aching muscles

5234.76 --> 5237.42
after that

5246.699 --> 5255.5199999999995
yeah thank God I've not had some kind of

5250.48 --> 5255.5199999999995
like chronic issue with that roof

5260.87 --> 5263.939
[Music]

5272.56 --> 5278.139
but yeah Jane I hope it's

5275.98 --> 5280.299999999999
it's been resolved you don't have that

5278.139 --> 5282.28
anymore I hope

5280.3 --> 5284.52
like how what happened in the first

5282.28 --> 5284.5199999999995
place

5284.56 --> 5289.320000000001
would you like sprain your leg or

5286.3 --> 5289.320000000001

5436.719 --> 5441.3
considerable amount of time they

5438.34 --> 5441.3
probably enjoyed yes

5445.179 --> 5452.679
it's just that my mother

5448.86 --> 5454.719
really like she doesn't really know what

5452.679 --> 5457.12
to do

5454.719 --> 5458.62
when like a horse gets out of control or

5457.12 --> 5460.9
anything

5458.62 --> 5462.94
she doesn't know what to do with like

5460.9 --> 5465.54
hysteria in general and that was the

5462.94 --> 5465.54
problem like

5467.5 --> 5474.159
and she yeah she could like communicate

5471.219 --> 5476.08
with her animal with her horse just fine

5474.159 --> 5478.719
right she could Horse backwards it's

5476.08 --> 5480.76
just that if they go wild

5478.719 --> 5482.94
she doesn't really know how to deal with

5480.76 --> 5482.9400000000005
that

5484.3 --> 5489.96
like when she gets nervous or something

5486.639 --> 5489.96
she just loses control

5491.56 --> 5496.0
that was a common issue

5493.78 --> 5499.8
with her

5496.0 --> 5499.8
very aggravating at times

5503.98 --> 5508.9
like I know what to do in those types of

5506.679 --> 5510.6990000000005
situations that's why I never really had

5508.9 --> 5513.96
an accident I've been thrown off horses

5510.699 --> 5513.96
by the way plenty of times

5517.239 --> 5522.759999999999
I actually sought that out

5520.239 --> 5525.159
I want I want it to be the badass guy

5522.76 --> 5527.1990000000005
that could ride that horse that

5525.159 --> 5530.86
everybody avoided because they were

5527.199 --> 5534.099999999999
berserking mad horses

5530.86 --> 5537.12
it's like yeah bring it on what you

5534.1 --> 5537.120000000001
think you can handle me

5538.6 --> 5544.2390000000005
a bit of Provider I guess but

5541.659 --> 5547.12
I never really got in an accident

5544.239 --> 5549.159
like bad

5547.12 --> 5551.08
I mean I got a couple of bruises and all

5549.159 --> 5556.32
that

5551.08 --> 5556.32
but I've learned very young how to fall

5556.37 --> 5560.26
[Music]

5557.56 --> 5563.02
very handy because I was also climbing

5560.26 --> 5565.96
and everything typically trees and [ __ ]

5563.02 --> 5568.120000000001
and just I learned how to fall properly

5565.96 --> 5571.08
how to not get damaged

5568.12 --> 5571.08
when you fall

5576.34 --> 5581.1
right

5577.48 --> 5581.099999999999
and it's kind of funny because

5582.46 --> 5586.84
yeah no it's not funny it's not never

5584.739 --> 5590.638999999999
mind just thinking back about horseback

5586.84 --> 5590.639
riding but yeah I was good at it

5591.639 --> 5595.1990000000005
I took it as a real challenge

5596.02 --> 5601.38
and some of the horses like they are

5598.42 --> 5601.38
freaking trolls

5602.44 --> 5607.0
like they had it literally horses like

5605.26 --> 5609.400000000001
even in groups

5607.0 --> 5612.1
they have their own little weird social

5609.4 --> 5613.659
life among one another and they get can

5612.1 --> 5615.1
get trollish

5613.659 --> 5617.86
and like

5615.1 --> 5621.42
bullying other horses and [ __ ]

5617.86 --> 5621.42
it's really weird how that works

5634.9 --> 5638.92
all right but you got to be really

5636.34 --> 5642.04
careful when like a horse is basically

5638.92 --> 5644.38
in love with another horse or like well

5642.04 --> 5645.94
not really in love goes in heat because

5644.38 --> 5647.8
then they can like get really

5645.94 --> 5649.54
uncontrolled when they have to like be

5647.8 --> 5651.159000000001
separated

5649.54 --> 5653.159
other way like

5651.159 --> 5656.82
yeah you can write them

5653.159 --> 5656.82
when they're like that

5659.62 --> 5664.42
usually you'll be like hanging with

5662.62 --> 5666.219
you'll be riding around with a horse

5664.42 --> 5669.6
with the giant slong hanging out like

5666.219 --> 5669.6
that as well so

5671.38 --> 5674.04
uh

5676.0 --> 5679.739
that never happened to me by the way

5686.92 --> 5692.679
but yeah anyway I do I would like to at

5690.82 --> 5696.28
some point do a horseback riding again

5692.679 --> 5700.38
if there's a good place for it

5696.28 --> 5700.38
where there's like a good culture

5700.96 --> 5706.02
that's because the the

5706.3 --> 5709.900000000001
Ranch

5707.98 --> 5711.459999999999
is it color Ranch

5709.9 --> 5713.62
where I went

5711.46 --> 5716.139
horseback riding I mean they had like

5713.62 --> 5719.94
they were really old-fashioned like no

5716.139 --> 5723.58
we don't take [ __ ] like they were not PC

5719.94 --> 5725.44
at all and they were kind of strict and

5723.58 --> 5728.679
I really loved it

5725.44 --> 5731.919999999999
like if you fell off a horse there

5728.679 --> 5733.78
you had to get back on doesn't matter

5731.92 --> 5736.2390000000005
how old you are

5733.78 --> 5738.46
like unless you were like like bleeding

5736.239 --> 5741.099999999999
or broken bones or like really hurting

5738.46 --> 5743.26
but some people even like with freaking

5741.1 --> 5745.179
broken bones would still get back on

5743.26 --> 5747.280000000001
they were that fanatical about it it was

5745.179 --> 5750.06
really bizarre in a way interesting and

5747.28 --> 5754.86
I loved it like that's the kind of

5750.06 --> 5754.860000000001
Branch I want to ride horses at

5755.02 --> 5761.320000000001
[Music]

5756.54 --> 5765.12
oh be careful oh don't go too fast no no

5761.32 --> 5765.12
just freaking ride horse

5766.739 --> 5774.28
not just surrounded by Westies

5770.86 --> 5777.28
that are overly careful not just like oh

5774.28 --> 5780.28
we're rich oh we got to be overly

5777.28 --> 5783.34
careful so that oh let's just give them

5780.28 --> 5785.139
a sensation like they're special they

5783.34 --> 5788.1990000000005
don't actually learn anything because

5785.139 --> 5791.86
everybody's way too careful and

5788.199 --> 5797.04
nobody challenges anybody

5791.86 --> 5797.04
boring really freaking boring

5797.8 --> 5802.4800000000005
foreign

5799.06 --> 5803.8
yeah no I want a place where I can ride

5802.48 --> 5806.5199999999995
a horse where you can actually do

5803.8 --> 5806.52
something with it

5818.139 --> 5825.0
best horse people understand how to

5820.9 --> 5825.0
their body without being yes absolutely

5825.159 --> 5829.719
no it's a completely pointless being

5827.02 --> 5832.320000000001
abusive that just makes the horse more

5829.719 --> 5832.32
abrasive

5832.36 --> 5836.139
I mean these were not like military

5834.28 --> 5840.099999999999
horses okay

5836.139 --> 5841.6
these were trained but they were still

5840.1 --> 5844.42
had their own

5841.6 --> 5847.0
quirks and things

5844.42 --> 5848.08
and most of those horses like you can't

5847.0 --> 5849.46
just

5848.08 --> 5852.54
like

5849.46 --> 5852.54
start hurting them

5856.96 --> 5862.78
like you could even only even if you

5860.5 --> 5865.179
would use like a whip and everybody did

5862.78 --> 5868.42
usually have like a whip like a typical

5865.179 --> 5870.9400000000005
short hand whip not like an actual

5868.42 --> 5872.4400000000005
snapping Whip or anything they didn't

5870.94 --> 5875.62
use that

5872.44 --> 5877.719
right but if people yeah you would only

5875.62 --> 5880.239
ever even get abusive when a horse would

5877.719 --> 5883.0
get like really abrasive and just like

5880.239 --> 5884.98
we're not gonna do it or like uh refuse

5883.0 --> 5887.8
to stay in line when they get really

5884.98 --> 5890.138999999999
annoying and trollish that's when you

5887.8 --> 5891.06
just start grabbing it's like when it's

5890.139 --> 5894.3
like

5891.06 --> 5894.3
stop it

5894.699 --> 5898.799999999999
but other than that I would never use it

5899.62 --> 5906.599999999999
I would just do everything with my hands

5902.32 --> 5906.599999999999
and my feet and my knees

5908.26 --> 5913.42
and also my spirit it's like sitting on

5911.02 --> 5914.9800000000005
there it is like zoned it you're zoned

5913.42 --> 5919.5
in in a way

5914.98 --> 5921.879999999999
and I can feel what the horse is

5919.5 --> 5924.28
like gonna do

5921.88 --> 5926.9800000000005
I could feel what he's gonna do

5924.28 --> 5929.5599999999995
I could feel when he was going to refuse

5926.98 --> 5931.299999999999
to jump and still not be able to do

5929.56 --> 5933.1
anything about it like if I would extra

5931.3 --> 5935.62
encourage they would still stop because

5933.1 --> 5938.76
I could feel like no like he is going to

5935.62 --> 5938.76
stop I can feel it

5939.4 --> 5942.36
it's interesting

5942.46 --> 5946.42
sort of a driver's intuition I have that

5944.8 --> 5949.56
with my car and that's not even a

5946.42 --> 5949.56
sentient thing so

5949.84 --> 5956.159000000001
I could just feel if something is gonna

5951.88 --> 5956.159000000001
happen out there in front of me

5957.82 --> 5963.099999999999
or if my car is going to give me issues

5961.06 --> 5965.400000000001
but yeah with the horses was much more

5963.1 --> 5965.400000000001
direct

5966.159 --> 5971.0199999999995
it was I had learned I learned so much

5968.5 --> 5974.44
doing horseback riding

5971.02 --> 5976.360000000001
those days like between eight

5974.44 --> 5978.5199999999995
and

5976.36 --> 5981.0
a 13 or something

5978.52 --> 5981.0
I think

5984.04 --> 5992.5199999999995
and then it became like too expensive

5987.88 --> 5992.52
and instead I I did Taekwondo then

5993.1 --> 5997.54
I did still did it simultaneously but I

5995.679 --> 5999.46
got more on Taekwondo and then just

5997.54 --> 6001.8
dropped the horseback riding it was also

5999.46 --> 6004.679
because my mother had that accident and

6001.8 --> 6007.38
it's like yeah

6004.679 --> 6009.179
that does really take the fun out of it

6007.38 --> 6012.719
it's like oh I'm going horseback riding

6009.179 --> 6015.179
my mother who's like terribly hurt and

6012.719 --> 6018.36
potentially like her profession even

6015.179 --> 6021.12
ruined because of that in a way well her

6018.36 --> 6025.04
love for piano like yeah that doesn't

6021.12 --> 6025.04
really feel well after that point

6045.3 --> 6051.179
I was only bitten

6047.94 --> 6055.919999999999
once early on yeah some of them like to

6051.179 --> 6058.139
take an air they liked it I mean horses

6055.92 --> 6059.6990000000005
can be bullies

6058.139 --> 6061.4400000000005
and like that they're like little

6059.699 --> 6063.178999999999
children they're bullies like little

6061.44 --> 6065.5199999999995
children sometimes and they can get

6063.179 --> 6067.7390000000005
really trollish they're just getting a

6065.52 --> 6069.719
mood where they're like yeah

6067.739 --> 6072.919999999999
sometimes they even some horses even

6069.719 --> 6072.92
like to make you startle

6077.34 --> 6083.06
but yeah I mean I've had horses that

6080.28 --> 6085.98
would literally bite people's asses

6083.06 --> 6087.780000000001
including my own

6085.98 --> 6090.48
and yeah it's not as funny as it sounds

6087.78 --> 6094.619
kind of painful

6090.48 --> 6095.459999999999
it's really ah yeah I mean this is the

6094.619 --> 6097.799999999999
horses

6095.46 --> 6099.96
are weird

6097.8 --> 6101.46
some of them

6099.96 --> 6103.5
they're all have their own characters

6101.46 --> 6107.28
and their own trade some were like

6103.5 --> 6109.619
really bullying some were like just

6107.28 --> 6111.179
super abrasive they would just be

6109.619 --> 6114.239
disobedient

6111.179 --> 6116.82
a lot in those kinds of moves but they

6114.239 --> 6119.699
all had ups and down Swings with it

6116.82 --> 6121.139
interesting like one week they'd be that

6119.699 --> 6123.36
mood and then the next week they

6121.139 --> 6125.96
wouldn't be that mood

6123.36 --> 6125.96
right

6145.32 --> 6149.119
your bullies to test you yeah yeah

6150.3 --> 6155.34
if they bit bite

6152.34 --> 6157.56
nip you in the you know what if you nip

6155.34 --> 6160.219
it in the bud

6157.56 --> 6160.219
right

6163.56 --> 6172.139
now I would now but back then I

6168.659 --> 6175.799999999999
I didn't really have that

6172.139 --> 6177.84
that attitude so I wasn't I was never

6175.8 --> 6180.860000000001
really able to nip it I would still make

6177.84 --> 6180.860000000001
a lot of effort though

6182.4 --> 6187.259999999999
but yeah that nipping it in the butt

6185.4 --> 6190.5199999999995
that didn't really work all that well

6187.26 --> 6190.52
back then for me

6195.98 --> 6201.299999999999
foreign

6197.82 --> 6203.96
but it didn't matter because in a way I

6201.3 --> 6203.96
like the challenge

6216.78 --> 6220.199
seeing where you fit in their packing

6218.82 --> 6222.44
order yeah

6220.199 --> 6222.44
foreign

6223.08 --> 6229.44
no but I was for example I was like the

6226.86 --> 6230.58
guy that actually did contests on a

6229.44 --> 6233.699
horse

6230.58 --> 6236.58
that nobody ever does that on

6233.699 --> 6239.5199999999995
because that horse is super abrasive

6236.58 --> 6242.659
like I would take challenges like I I'm

6239.52 --> 6242.659000000001
going to do this

6243.179 --> 6251.1
it didn't work but I did it anyway

6246.179 --> 6253.26
I mean yeah I I was at least trying it

6251.1 --> 6254.88
I mean yeah I could have taken easier

6253.26 --> 6256.92
horse

6254.88 --> 6259.26
but no

6256.92 --> 6260.159
and it was also weird because eventually

6259.26 --> 6262.56
like

6260.159 --> 6265.379999999999
I would get just designated that one

6262.56 --> 6268.139
abrasive horse called Rascal by the way

6265.38 --> 6270.6
because I was like one of the few people

6268.139 --> 6273.78
that could actually handle him and not

6270.6 --> 6277.139
get super annoyed by him because he was

6273.78 --> 6280.619
not very beloved by other people

6277.139 --> 6283.32
but I was like yeah I get him

6280.619 --> 6286.219
he's just super abrasive and

6283.32 --> 6286.219
and like

6286.3 --> 6290.1
[Applause]

6287.88 --> 6292.86
spiffy what do you call it when they're

6290.1 --> 6295.5
like like really spirited curious and

6292.86 --> 6297.299999999999
energetic but also with pride and [ __ ]

6295.5 --> 6298.92
right

6297.3 --> 6302.58
and the real problem is is when they're

6298.92 --> 6305.76
like oh no I don't want to

6302.58 --> 6309.42
and then they really don't

6305.76 --> 6312.9800000000005
like a like a mule that that horse could

6309.42 --> 6312.9800000000005
be stubborn as a freaking mule

6313.86 --> 6318.679
and he had a lot of energy because he

6315.78 --> 6318.679
was still young then

6319.26 --> 6323.6990000000005
but they would typically designate me on

6321.42 --> 6326.42
that horse because I think I was good

6323.699 --> 6326.419999999999
for that horse

6327.239 --> 6331.919999999999
it helped him and nobody almost nobody

6329.88 --> 6335.42
would ride him but me

6331.92 --> 6335.42
I mean there were some others

6336.179 --> 6339.84
but yeah I would just get designated

6338.219 --> 6341.219
with that horse eventually and I was

6339.84 --> 6343.9800000000005
like yeah sure

6341.219 --> 6348.2390000000005
because

6343.98 --> 6351.48
I had some really good times with him

6348.239 --> 6353.759999999999
I like yeah sometimes he was just super

6351.48 --> 6356.94
abrasive or he would just throw me off

6353.76 --> 6359.76
all unexpectedly like a certain 90

6356.94 --> 6361.259999999999
degree turn out of nowhere and literally

6359.76 --> 6363.360000000001
yeah you're still going straight ahead

6361.26 --> 6365.9400000000005
that sort of stuff would happen

6363.36 --> 6367.98
sometimes it would and those were not

6365.94 --> 6369.54
really nice days for horseback riding

6367.98 --> 6371.759999999999
but very challenging and I would always

6369.54 --> 6374.94
get back on no matter what even if that

6371.76 --> 6377.9400000000005
happened like three times in a row

6374.94 --> 6381.0
but other days he would wouldn't be like

6377.94 --> 6385.5599999999995
that and then he would be like a

6381.0 --> 6388.739
freaking War Horse like perfect like he

6385.56 --> 6391.92
would read my mind what I want and then

6388.739 --> 6394.379999999999
do that perfectly

6391.92 --> 6397.139
what

6394.38 --> 6400.7390000000005
unfortunately he didn't do that

6397.139 --> 6402.96
during like the jump Contest no he chose

6400.739 --> 6405.659
to be abrasive literally refused for

6402.96 --> 6409.58
three times with the first jump

6405.659 --> 6409.58
yeah okay about the first jump

6411.06 --> 6417.06
and then after that it was over and then

6413.639 --> 6421.679
he did literally flawlessly

6417.06 --> 6423.360000000001
in record time like the like never the

6421.679 --> 6427.32
record time like

6423.36 --> 6431.0599999999995
by far of the winner

6427.32 --> 6431.0599999999995
like it was that kind of a horse

6433.5 --> 6437.3
yeah it was interesting times

6440.28 --> 6442.46
