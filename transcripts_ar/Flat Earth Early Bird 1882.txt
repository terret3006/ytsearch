95.92 --> 99.159
really

96.88 --> 102.32
matching the actual weather because it

99.159 --> 106.119

Sunny which is very

109.24 --> 117.88
nice also like there's just not so much

114.119 --> 121.32

645.36 --> 651.48

649.12 --> 654.5600000000001
oh I didn't

651.48 --> 658.04

654.56 --> 661.04
before maybe you have and I just forgot

658.04 --> 661.04
sorry

670.44 --> 675.36
not really okay well thanks for speaking

673.2 --> 678.72
up

675.36 --> 682.32
and becoming part of the chat like I can

678.72 --> 685.519
always use more real people in my

682.32 --> 688.279
chat cuz I mean this is after all like

685.519 --> 691.2
basically me talking to the chat that's

688.279 --> 693.519
the show set up pretty

691.2 --> 696.9590000000001
much these

693.519 --> 700.44
days I don't like have a lot of

696.959 --> 703.279
like presentations to give

700.44 --> 706.0
anymore although it does roll out

703.279 --> 708.32
spontaneously if the sub if a subject

706.0 --> 708.32
comes

709.48 --> 714.48
along right because I really like to

711.839 --> 717.639
give presentations when I feel there is

714.48 --> 720.9590000000001
specific interest for it so that's kind

717.639 --> 720.9590000000001
of how I do it

721.24 --> 725.2
like people are like hey what about this

723.2 --> 727.48
what about that and that's when I then

725.2 --> 730.9200000000001
just like oh okay so somebody's actually

727.48 --> 732.76
here now that wants to hear

730.92 --> 734.639
it and

732.76 --> 738.12
that

734.639 --> 739.44
yeah I guess that fuels me to really put

738.12 --> 741.9590000000001
it

739.44 --> 743.9200000000001
down more with all the detail and

741.959 --> 747.0
everything so yeah always happy to have

743.92 --> 750.4799999999999
another long-term

747.0 --> 753.079
viewer speak up in my chat really

750.48 --> 753.0790000000001

772.079 --> 777.519

777.839 --> 782.8800000000001

822.48 --> 825.9590000000001
happened whole

830.8 --> 836.4799999999999
lot I can't believe it's like 10 years

837.759 --> 840.759
ago

843.639 --> 847.36
also I can't believe that I I don't feel

846.04 --> 852.16
10 years

847.36 --> 852.16
older but I do feel like 10 years

854.24 --> 858.44
wiser and I have that mustache

858.68 --> 864.5999999999999
now I bet if I like if I were to shave

862.44 --> 867.72
it off which I'm not going

864.6 --> 870.6800000000001
to that I'd probably be like almost

867.72 --> 870.6800000000001
indistinguishable

871.8 --> 876.0
from like the

873.48 --> 879.0
beginning although

876.0 --> 879.0
not

879.279 --> 884.959
like not my Radiance cuz that was of

882.36 --> 889.8000000000001
course different because I was all green

884.959 --> 893.56
to it and still nervous

889.8 --> 896.68
and not all that developed in talking

893.56 --> 900.56
English that much although pretty I was

896.68 --> 903.6389999999999
already pretty far but I've I've really

900.56 --> 903.6389999999999

927.6 --> 934.72
training

929.9 --> 936.56
[Music]

934.72 --> 938.639
don't shave because you can always make

936.56 --> 941.079
money giving out

938.639 --> 943.199
mustache I don't know what that means

941.079 --> 946.199
and I think that might be

943.199 --> 946.199
better

949.079 --> 957.5999999999999
what for stu oh the racing thing he won

953.92 --> 960.5999999999999

1453.0 --> 1457.96
watch anything I still have to finish

1454.76 --> 1462.1589999999999
watching like the

1457.96 --> 1462.159
physician still haven't continued

1466.799 --> 1469.799
that

1496.76 --> 1499.76
for

1526.679 --> 1529.679
for

1533.039 --> 1538.89
right and perhaps soon I will be just

1535.88 --> 1542.029
like more doing movie reviews and all

1538.89 --> 1542.029
[Music]

1544.48 --> 1550.32
that because I will then get to actually

1548.08 --> 1552.46
watching those

1550.32 --> 1555.609
movies

1552.46 --> 1555.609
[Music]

1556.679 --> 1559.679
right

1582.279 --> 1587.36
wow remember how 3 days ago I was like

1585.559 --> 1589.0
really fatigued and all that that's why

1587.36 --> 1591.799
I did that short show and then yesterday

1589.0 --> 1595.48
I was still a little bit fatigue and now

1591.799 --> 1598.799
it's like just a tiny bit but I mean I

1595.48 --> 1602.32
did sleep pretty well so I'm

1598.799 --> 1602.32
not that

1605.72 --> 1611.3990000000001
tired I will

1608.52 --> 1615.6
however like turn on my coffee soon and

1611.399 --> 1615.6
then take that hopefully that'll

1616.6 --> 1619.6
work

1643.72 --> 1648.799
have thought of a different type of

1646.52 --> 1651.96
show

1648.799 --> 1651.96
yeah I'm not sure

1653.799 --> 1657.679
yet I'm not entirely

1665.679 --> 1670.6000000000001
sure but I was thinking like maybe more

1668.72 --> 1674.799
of

1670.6 --> 1675.9189999999999
a like eventually maybe more a bit of a

1674.799 --> 1678.08
panel

1675.919 --> 1680.6000000000001
show it would be pretty pretty cool they

1678.08 --> 1684.279
have some of you guys just be there and

1680.6 --> 1684.279
like we could have a

1687.88 --> 1692.24
conversation like instead of just

1689.799 --> 1692.24
through the

1701.72 --> 1706.44
chat but I I mean I might need to just

1704.96 --> 1709.44
build up a bit

1706.44 --> 1709.44
more

1709.96 --> 1714.3600000000001
before I get to that

1711.88 --> 1717.2
point it's just I had this feeling of

1714.36 --> 1722.32
like just transforming

1717.2 --> 1725.0
and getting more into like spirituality

1722.32 --> 1727.799
and and rudol Steiner

1725.0 --> 1729.72
lore that kind of thing and maybe yeah

1727.799 --> 1732.84
just I want more of

1729.72 --> 1736.0
that it's good there's so

1732.84 --> 1738.519
much to

1736.0 --> 1741.399
develop and yeah yeah so

1738.519 --> 1745.679
that's like dare I say move away from

1741.399 --> 1745.6789999999999
Flat Earth a bit I mean it's just

1746.64 --> 1755.039
that it's really hard now for me to find

1750.36 --> 1757.9599999999998
anything that just that I can like

1755.039 --> 1760.96
develop I got all these ideas I could

1757.96 --> 1762.64
basically put them down interactively

1760.96 --> 1764.279
like somebody asked me and just like oh

1762.64 --> 1766.76
this and that this is the Lemma this is

1764.279 --> 1768.679
how you falsify it this is how far the

1766.76 --> 1771.96
knowledge goes this is the potential and

1768.679 --> 1774.0
then that's it and I've pretty much done

1771.96 --> 1776.96
everything with that I mean what haven't

1774.0 --> 1779.32
I done

1776.96 --> 1782.159
right and hey there's been some really

1779.32 --> 1786.8799999999999
fascinating imaginations that I mean

1782.159 --> 1789.44
would make a good sci-fi film or

1786.88 --> 1793.48
whatever just by the conception of it

1789.44 --> 1796.0
like lowering down into the big black

1793.48 --> 1800.679
tunnel remember that one and then ending

1796.0 --> 1804.039
up in the sky sky that kind of thing

1800.679 --> 1807.76
like if it was looping up to

1804.039 --> 1810.72
down which it seems kind of absurd of

1807.76 --> 1814.679
course like even within like what could

1810.72 --> 1817.48
be possible that would be kind of

1814.679 --> 1820.519
remote but I mean can't completely

1817.48 --> 1825.48
exclude it though I mean we can't really

1820.519 --> 1828.3990000000001
even go up high enough to know what is

1825.48 --> 1830.96
there but maybe some somebody could like

1828.399 --> 1830.9599999999998
lower

1833.6 --> 1837.7199999999998
down you would definitely need like a

1836.64 --> 1840.88
suit

1837.72 --> 1843.72
though against the

1840.88 --> 1846.5590000000002
cold like to lower down in such a thing

1843.72 --> 1849.159
you would like actually almost like need

1846.559 --> 1849.1589999999999
a space

1850.0 --> 1855.32
suit to deal with the the lower pressure

1853.0 --> 1855.32
and the

1856.24 --> 1859.24
temperatures

1863.24 --> 1870.84
watch any no haven't really Billy

1866.36 --> 1870.84
bars I've not heard of any of those

1879.72 --> 1886.159
people I do yeah maybe I I should like

1883.399 --> 1887.9189999999999
look around a bit more I'm I'm just

1886.159 --> 1889.159
very

1887.919 --> 1892.8400000000001
as a

1889.159 --> 1895.72
person I have this tendency to just

1892.84 --> 1898.24
stick with what and who I

1895.72 --> 1901.919
know a

1898.24 --> 1904.48
lot and then through those people that

1901.919 --> 1907.44
probably aren't so

1904.48 --> 1910.1200000000001
monotonous with their with who they

1907.44 --> 1912.0800000000002
check out then through those people I

1910.12 --> 1914.8799999999999
can check out what they check

1912.08 --> 1916.76
out and then either realize like yeah

1914.88 --> 1919.6000000000001
I'm really glad that I don't because

1916.76 --> 1919.6
they are just

1920.12 --> 1924.76
like into weird people like Owen

1922.799 --> 1926.44
Benjamin does like kind of get into

1924.76 --> 1930.72
weird

1926.44 --> 1935.159
people over the like all over the

1930.72 --> 1939.96
place not super weirdos but still like

1935.159 --> 1939.96
it's just like his type are kind of

1944.2 --> 1948.6000000000001
weird and like he gets into trouble with

1946.799 --> 1951.639
him and all that and they turn on them

1948.6 --> 1951.639
and all that

1953.399 --> 1959.799
[Â __Â ] but I do like get to know a bit

1957.24 --> 1962.08
through other people what's out there

1959.799 --> 1964.96
I'm not like a guy that's the super

1962.08 --> 1964.96
eager to just

1966.2 --> 1972.88
like just look around see what's out

1969.159 --> 1975.24
there as much I mostly like through

1972.88 --> 1977.159
other people bump into other people that

1975.24 --> 1981.279
then turn out to have their own thing

1977.159 --> 1984.519
and so I I got a few people that I

1981.279 --> 1987.639
met through ow and

1984.519 --> 1990.519
Benjamin like some people through Owen

1987.639 --> 1990.519
Benjamin have met

1992.36 --> 1997.1589999999999
me and then I like to hang around their

1995.279 --> 1997.96
channels when they do like streams of

1997.159 --> 2001.2
some

1997.96 --> 2003.6390000000001
kind and so yeah

2001.2 --> 2005.96
I there are some people out there it's

2003.639 --> 2008.9599999999998
just they're not

2005.96 --> 2008.96
super

2010.44 --> 2014.88
specifically interesting enough for me

2012.679 --> 2017.0800000000002
to like bring them up on my channel like

2014.88 --> 2020.2
oh yeah that guy wow that's because it's

2017.08 --> 2023.8799999999999
like no he just like I don't know just

2020.2 --> 2025.32
rap videos and talks about conspiracy

2023.88 --> 2028.3200000000002
stuff and

2025.32 --> 2030.24
it's it's not like wow you really need

2028.32 --> 2034.0
to hear this but it's just like it's fun

2030.24 --> 2035.96
to hang around though that's

2034.0 --> 2038.96
it but

2035.96 --> 2038.96
the

2041.2 --> 2044.279
you're the same way

2044.6 --> 2047.9189999999999
right right

2057.079 --> 2062.2400000000002
exactly you see a lot of people make

2059.56 --> 2064.44
channels of reacting to Christian V what

2062.24 --> 2064.4399999999996
do you

2065.879 --> 2068.879
mean

2069.2 --> 2074.0789999999997
wow

2071.24 --> 2076.4399999999996
damn the downloads are already complete

2074.079 --> 2076.44
that was

2093.31 --> 2098.1
[Music]

2095.879 --> 2101.27
quick

2098.1 --> 2101.27
[Music]

2125.37 --> 2128.5699999999997
[Music]

2158.599 --> 2166.44
oh re response videos

2162.28 --> 2166.44
right yeah some people do

2167.599 --> 2174.04
that like I could technically do that

2171.16 --> 2177.56
it's just that I've never done

2174.04 --> 2180.319
it and this sounds maybe arrogant I

2177.56 --> 2182.24
don't mean it it just it feels like it's

2180.319 --> 2184.92
it's beneath

2182.24 --> 2187.64
me not saying that everybody that does

2184.92 --> 2190.359
that is like lower than me just like it

2187.64 --> 2190.359
just feels

2194.56 --> 2197.92
like I don't

2202.96 --> 2208.4
know I yeah I've always felt like yeah

2206.079 --> 2210.4
I'll sit alongside something like that

2208.4 --> 2213.7200000000003
but it's just not something that I feel

2210.4 --> 2213.7200000000003
like I should be doing

2215.68 --> 2218.68
personally

2222.8 --> 2229.4
also like when you start to do

2226.599 --> 2232.0
that it's kind of hard to like get back

2229.4 --> 2236.2400000000002
on your own ground again haven't you

2232.0 --> 2238.56
noticed that any of you like At first

2236.24 --> 2241.64
people like really are there like oh I

2238.56 --> 2243.96
have my things to share my ideas and

2241.64 --> 2245.839
like oh let's talk about this and that

2243.96 --> 2249.64
but as soon as people with their

2245.839 --> 2253.359
channels basically start reviewing other

2249.64 --> 2255.44
videos it's like very hard to get back

2253.359 --> 2257.96
on your own

2255.44 --> 2262.2400000000002
again I don't know maybe I'm imagining

2257.96 --> 2262.2400000000002
this but I see a pattern

2264.839 --> 2270.16
there and because I already saw that

2267.96 --> 2273.44
pattern a while ago I was just like you

2270.16 --> 2278.5989999999997
know what I'd rather have

2273.44 --> 2278.599
just boring parts of my show

2278.64 --> 2284.96
where I'm just like not really talking

2281.64 --> 2287.2799999999997
and like uncertain kind of waiting to

2284.96 --> 2290.319
respond maybe get agitated that things

2287.28 --> 2295.3190000000004
are so slow and and then eventually

2290.319 --> 2297.359
start back up again because like as soon

2295.319 --> 2299.88
as I get into the flow and like start

2297.359 --> 2302.96
fractal talking like complicated

2299.88 --> 2306.04
explanations like that is like way more

2302.96 --> 2308.52
valuable as a skill just for

2306.04 --> 2308.52
entertainment

2308.64 --> 2314.2
only compared to like just reviewing a

2314.599 --> 2324.319
video where just play it and then

2318.56 --> 2324.319
respond no you are not what what do you

2335.52 --> 2338.52
mean

2350.64 --> 2356.52
that's kind of tough to have pinpoint

2353.319 --> 2360.56
exactly what you're talking about rich

2356.52 --> 2363.44
G oh what I says F right A lot of people

2360.56 --> 2367.0789999999997
do make good money of that I guess they

2363.44 --> 2369.48
do and hey if it's like

2367.079 --> 2371.2400000000002
if you choose to do that then you can

2369.48 --> 2373.52
like become really good at it I mean

2371.24 --> 2377.72
there's people out there that just

2373.52 --> 2377.72
always do it and they're good at

2380.319 --> 2383.319
it

2383.56 --> 2389.88
but with doing that comes a certain type

2388.599 --> 2392.88
of

2389.88 --> 2398.88
attitude it it

2392.88 --> 2398.88
develops and then like you're stuck with

2406.839 --> 2412.0789999999997
that it's just something I noticed like

2409.56 --> 2414.7599999999998
what once you start doing that you you

2412.079 --> 2418.2000000000003
have a certain demeanor and attitude

2414.76 --> 2419.92
about it about doing those things and

2418.2 --> 2424.04
you stick to

2419.92 --> 2427.76
that so I like to be

2424.04 --> 2430.599
free I want to be free

2427.76 --> 2434.8390000000004
free to do what I want to do and free to

2430.599 --> 2440.96
be bored and entertained

2434.839 --> 2440.96
and and down and up and just like be

2443.079 --> 2447.7200000000003
me and I feel if I would start doing

2445.88 --> 2451.599
that that that would kind of like

2447.72 --> 2454.319
gradually go away I would get stuck in a

2451.599 --> 2458.319
rut and I mean if I'd started doing that

2454.319 --> 2461.0
I would have never even made it this far

2458.319 --> 2464.359
realize that I do a show every day right

2461.0 --> 2468.079
I mean that's kind of significant in the

2464.359 --> 2470.72
face of all that like when you do a show

2468.079 --> 2474.44
every damn day it's a

2470.72 --> 2477.0789999999997
challenge to maintain inspiration of

2474.44 --> 2477.079
just doing

2477.64 --> 2483.0789999999997
that be a globber for a change

2485.24 --> 2491.9199999999996
what I mean I can enact a Ballard no

2489.92 --> 2494.359
problem I still have Ballwin I mean what

2491.92 --> 2494.359
what's the

2501.58 --> 2506.84
[Music]

2509.0 --> 2515.56
point right I mean simulating a globber

2512.64 --> 2516.92
like Ballwin it really only is useful

2515.56 --> 2521.2
when we need

2516.92 --> 2526.2400000000002
need a simulation of a baller to

2521.2 --> 2526.24
challenge a flat Earth argument

2527.68 --> 2532.64
right so if somebody comes like oh yeah

2530.48 --> 2534.72
I have I want to like have this argument

2532.64 --> 2538.839
against the Ballers like they like they

2534.72 --> 2541.0789999999997
go up in Discord and debate Ballers

2538.839 --> 2543.64
right and they come to me like yeah what

2541.079 --> 2546.48
do you think about this they write it

2543.64 --> 2549.0789999999997
down like this is my flat Earth argument

2546.48 --> 2551.92
then I can use Ballwin to

2549.079 --> 2555.119
like this is how I would respond to that

2551.92 --> 2559.2400000000002
as a baller to get out of

2555.119 --> 2562.7200000000003
it and I can still use that without

2559.24 --> 2564.9599999999996
literally acting it out it's just like I

2562.72 --> 2568.7999999999997
have the baller mind I know how that

2564.96 --> 2571.64
game works and I'm like I can be really

2568.8 --> 2571.6400000000003
detailed about

2574.839 --> 2580.359
it definitely leave beneath

2577.359 --> 2580.359
me

2581.6 --> 2587.319
[Music]

2584.64 --> 2589.5589999999997
yeah but I mean maybe one time I could

2587.319 --> 2591.8
do if I'm really inspired and energetic

2589.559 --> 2594.88
I could like maybe do a skit where I

2591.8 --> 2597.96
like do a confessional debating but that

2594.88 --> 2597.96
is kind of tricky

2601.319 --> 2609.4
though confessional debers debating of a

2604.839 --> 2612.88
globber like what McKean does that's

2609.4 --> 2612.88
pretty challenging

2622.16 --> 2627.839
mentally so like from a Global

2624.599 --> 2630.92
Perspective argue why the globe doesn't

2627.839 --> 2632.48
work but then not conclude that it's not

2630.92 --> 2635.079
a

2632.48 --> 2638.079
globe that's

2635.079 --> 2638.079
complicated

2640.0 --> 2644.44
like it's already complicated enough to

2641.88 --> 2648.079
even spot that that is what is actually

2644.44 --> 2650.48
happening but to do it as a simulation I

2648.079 --> 2653.48
don't know I'm not there yet I might

2650.48 --> 2653.48
never get

2665.0 --> 2668.0
there

2677.079 --> 2682.96
there then you have an audience who is

2679.559 --> 2686.2400000000002
there for just that for what exactly by

2682.96 --> 2689.0
the way I didn't notice that

2686.24 --> 2691.2
response to me just being

2689.0 --> 2694.96
me and

2691.2 --> 2697.96
free I mean I hope

2694.96 --> 2697.96
so

2709.74 --> 2712.85
[Music]

2724.88 --> 2727.88
that

2754.88 --> 2757.88
h

2760.96 --> 2763.4
howy you do

2777.47 --> 2780.68
[Music]

2784.8 --> 2787.8
pons

2814.599 --> 2818.119
I'm so happy the weather's so

2818.16 --> 2824.2799999999997
beautiful is it

2820.599 --> 2826.92
weird that I kind of like feel really

2824.28 --> 2829.559
happy about a lot of things I feel

2826.92 --> 2831.64
really happy and thankful for a lot of

2829.559 --> 2834.7200000000003
things

2831.64 --> 2836.64
now maybe it's because of all the fear

2834.72 --> 2839.5989999999997
that happened to

2836.64 --> 2842.2
me then when I get out of it it's like

2839.599 --> 2844.7200000000003
oh my God it's a miracle like it feels

2842.2 --> 2847.72
like everything is suddenly a

2844.72 --> 2847.72
miracle

2847.76 --> 2854.559
like I'm just so happy that I could be

2850.359 --> 2854.5589999999997
here and just see it and enjoy it

2874.72 --> 2877.72
and

2882.68 --> 2889.96
thank God every day for that yeah well

2886.839 --> 2892.319
logically everybody should but I mean

2889.96 --> 2894.76
there's plenty of days where I just like

2892.319 --> 2898.16
eventually I just kind

2894.76 --> 2900.88
of like what happened before the the the

2898.16 --> 2903.64
whole situation with the the thug on the

2900.88 --> 2907.4
street right I was just

2903.64 --> 2909.319
like more agitated more like and then

2907.4 --> 2912.079
you're not very thankful it's like

2909.319 --> 2916.119
you're just preoccupied with internal

2912.079 --> 2916.119
stuff no really care too

2917.72 --> 2925.48
much but like a good scare really does

2922.16 --> 2928.72
like wake you back up to like how

2925.48 --> 2928.72
thankful you should really

2934.599 --> 2937.599
be

2958.559 --> 2964.799
maybe the technique is working

2962.04 --> 2967.2799999999997
what no that that doesn't directly

2964.799 --> 2969.28
involve that

2967.28 --> 2971.119
and yes the technique

2969.28 --> 2975.119
works but I

2971.119 --> 2977.6400000000003
mean like it

2975.119 --> 2979.0
yeah the thing is the technique works

2977.64 --> 2982.04
like really

2979.0 --> 2985.799
acutely like almost

2982.04 --> 2990.079
immediately and sometimes after an hour

2985.799 --> 2992.04
like the bigger influence happens but

2990.079 --> 2994.1600000000003
it's very acute it's not saying oh you

2992.04 --> 2997.72
just do the technique every day and then

2994.16 --> 3002.2
gradually after a month or two you start

2997.72 --> 3007.04
to really notice a no no it's way more

3002.2 --> 3007.04
direct it's very

3024.44 --> 3027.44
quick

3050.0 --> 3057.359
what is the technique it's a Rudolph

3053.52 --> 3059.52
Steiner lore based

3057.359 --> 3063.319
healing

3059.52 --> 3066.24
prayer it's very comparable to a prayer

3063.319 --> 3069.24
but it doesn't follow the classical

3066.24 --> 3069.24
prayer

3072.16 --> 3076.1189999999997
setup but I mean it's

3076.28 --> 3082.0400000000004
it people would

3079.559 --> 3084.4
probably yeah it's just very comparable

3082.04 --> 3087.92
to a prayer except it's just very

3084.4 --> 3090.92
directed it's

3087.92 --> 3090.92
more

3093.079 --> 3097.92
technical my laugh Y at me all the time

3096.72 --> 3103.24
for that

3097.92 --> 3103.2400000000002
what agravated fast but you

3111.06 --> 3114.13
[Music]

3114.359 --> 3117.359
trying

3144.28 --> 3147.28
all

3163.28 --> 3168.28
you relax and give it to

3165.97 --> 3170.2799999999997
[Music]

3168.28 --> 3174.3590000000004
Jesus

3170.28 --> 3176.96
right well in a way that is separate

3174.359 --> 3179.799
like but you could can compare it maybe

3176.96 --> 3182.96
it is just it's very similar it's just

3179.799 --> 3187.72
that the technique is so specific and

3182.96 --> 3187.7200000000003
conscious about it about what is

3188.319 --> 3194.04
happening so yeah when I need to like

3191.28 --> 3196.96
let it go it's really just a conscious

3194.04 --> 3200.119
process where I'm like I need to just

3196.96 --> 3203.359
drop the actions of what I'm doing just

3200.119 --> 3205.7200000000003
let it stop stop it just just stop it

3203.359 --> 3209.0789999999997
but like consciously actively stop and I

3205.72 --> 3211.2
do have like the talent to really do

3209.079 --> 3212.7200000000003
that not every person can do that like a

3211.2 --> 3214.4399999999996
lot of people like they would like to

3212.72 --> 3217.72
tell themselves to stop it but they just

3214.44 --> 3220.599
can't help it I can help it as soon as

3217.72 --> 3222.24
I'm like really conscious about it like

3220.599 --> 3224.88
whoa there's something going on I have

3222.24 --> 3226.3999999999996
to notice it and then I can really do

3224.88 --> 3229.559
something about

3226.4 --> 3231.599
it and then I like Let it go then it'll

3229.559 --> 3233.6400000000003
still just like keep spinning and then

3231.599 --> 3237.6800000000003
the technique will help

3233.64 --> 3241.64
me like to basically do a spiritual

3237.68 --> 3245.0789999999997
reset kind of thing like quite literally

3241.64 --> 3246.16
so that first you have to like let go of

3245.079 --> 3249.799
your

3246.16 --> 3252.92
actions that maintain that thing that's

3249.799 --> 3255.68
happening then it'll still keep going a

3252.92 --> 3258.6800000000003
bit first you retract and then you use

3255.68 --> 3261.0
the technique to like do a reset and

3258.68 --> 3265.7599999999998
then like it stops

3261.0 --> 3268.2
and yeah that's the way that works best

3265.76 --> 3270.76
because if you just do the technique but

3268.2 --> 3272.1189999999997
you still keep doing it it'll just start

3270.76 --> 3275.48
over again

3272.119 --> 3277.88
immediately you'll just undo the reset

3275.48 --> 3279.76
immediately so first you got to stop

3277.88 --> 3282.2000000000003
doing the thing that you're doing

3279.76 --> 3284.28
internally that's causing it and then

3282.2 --> 3287.799
you can reset

3284.28 --> 3291.48
it instead of like taking a long long

3287.799 --> 3291.48
time to let it slowly die

3293.24 --> 3298.7599999999998
down how did I learn the technique I

3296.44 --> 3302.16
copied it I copied it from my

3298.76 --> 3305.3190000000004
healer I simulated

3302.16 --> 3307.64
him he never even told me to do it I

3305.319 --> 3310.2
just did it I did it out of curiosity

3307.64 --> 3313.72
and it worked

3310.2 --> 3316.96
amazingly and that was surreal like I

3313.72 --> 3319.7599999999998
didn't like I never I don't even like

3316.96 --> 3322.4
have it down on paper the details I've

3319.76 --> 3324.039
just been like listening to him saying

3322.4 --> 3326.559
all those things over the phone and all

3324.039 --> 3329.92
that

3326.559 --> 3334.0
and then not even like copy the words

3329.92 --> 3336.7200000000003
but just like copy the feeling of it and

3334.0 --> 3339.76
roughly trying to create a path of the

3336.72 --> 3343.16
words so effectively I apply the

3339.76 --> 3346.2400000000002
technique differently as he does it he

3343.16 --> 3348.3999999999996
has a vast array of details that he's

3346.24 --> 3351.68
very conscious about I am like doing a

3348.4 --> 3354.0
more standardized version of that but

3351.68 --> 3357.0
that still

3354.0 --> 3357.0
works

3359.16 --> 3365.72
so that's the whole thing about it the

3363.119 --> 3368.92
technique is

3365.72 --> 3371.799
dynamic like people do it differently

3368.92 --> 3374.6800000000003
and it even was told that like my dad

3371.799 --> 3377.2
who knows him my healer and like there's

3374.68 --> 3379.24
a whole group of people and they all do

3377.2 --> 3383.68
that sort of thing but they all do it

3379.24 --> 3387.16
their own unique way that's like wow I

3383.68 --> 3389.2799999999997
mean just to know that is like wow it's

3387.16 --> 3390.799
so magical like they're all doing it

3389.28 --> 3392.2400000000002
completely different they're doing the

3390.799 --> 3396.48
same thing but they're doing it in a

3392.24 --> 3399.2799999999997
different way and it all works it's it

3396.48 --> 3403.839
just blows my

3399.28 --> 3407.3190000000004
mind and I'm sort of I want to be one of

3403.839 --> 3407.319
them I really

3407.76 --> 3415.96
do or or half like that I mean I don't

3413.68 --> 3417.96
know if I'm ever going to be like my

3415.96 --> 3420.559
healer like a full-time guy that just

3417.96 --> 3424.16
like does that all day long with people

3420.559 --> 3426.2000000000003
like I don't know if I I'd have to the

3424.16 --> 3427.24
mission the eternal mission to even do

3426.2 --> 3430.839
that it's

3427.24 --> 3434.72
like because part of my mission is to

3430.839 --> 3437.359
make things understood that's not his

3434.72 --> 3439.9199999999996
mission it is my mission it's my

3437.359 --> 3442.64
specific range of

3439.92 --> 3444.88
talents that enables me to do that so

3442.64 --> 3448.799
that is my mission so it's like I'm not

3444.88 --> 3452.6400000000003
supposed to be like the next in line to

3448.799 --> 3454.72
him like I'm going to be his followup no

3452.64 --> 3457.4
that's that's like not my destiny it's

3454.72 --> 3461.24
my destiny to like learn that and use

3457.4 --> 3464.4
that and like instead of a full priest

3461.24 --> 3466.9199999999996
be like a half

3464.4 --> 3469.559
priest so I guess I would be like a half

3466.92 --> 3469.559
priest half

3469.72 --> 3474.9599999999996
wizard oh here comes the word

3472.64 --> 3478.0789999999997
wizard oh the word wizard is so so

3474.96 --> 3478.079
triggering for so many

3483.039 --> 3486.88
people just like the word

3487.28 --> 3494.0
witch I think that 34s everybody just

3491.48 --> 3497.4
specifically sees it as

3494.0 --> 3501.319
negative or evil or

3497.4 --> 3501.319
deceptive which I find very

3503.72 --> 3506.72
disappointing
