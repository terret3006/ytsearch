they'll be much appreciated appreciate

73.28 --> 78.64
it

73.76 --> 82.32000000000001
right so weather today is

78.64 --> 86.0
actually quite beautiful woke up to this

82.32 --> 88.24
sun pretty much shining in my face

86.0 --> 91.119
so now it's just i've gone behind a

88.24 --> 94.479
little cloud over there

91.119 --> 96.96
overall it's been very clear and

94.479 --> 96.96
beautiful

98.079 --> 102.479
it was by the way extremely cold

100.159 --> 104.88000000000001
yesterday night

102.479 --> 107.84
it's even freezing it was ice on the

104.88 --> 114.15899999999999
roofs and on cars and everything

107.84 --> 117.2
but yeah the sun this morning kind of

114.159 --> 120.96000000000001
defrosted all that and it's been

117.2 --> 124.399
kind of nice it's still very cold though

120.96 --> 128.319
especially now that ah

124.399 --> 130.319
what just started raining is

128.319 --> 133.599
right it's still cold although not as

130.319 --> 135.599
cold as in spain so i've heard

133.599 --> 138.319
because apparently there they have like

135.599 --> 141.599
record cold temperatures like

138.319 --> 144.0
below 30 minus 30

141.599 --> 146.48
celsius and that kind of stuff pretty

144.0 --> 146.48
extreme

146.56 --> 154.84
i saw some article about that

151.28 --> 157.04
over here yeah it's kind of nice right

154.84 --> 161.28
now

157.04 --> 166.07999999999998
hmm hello

161.28 --> 170.0
terret 3006 who is first zach

166.08 --> 173.68
good to see you mountain smashing

170.0 --> 175.07
hello right

173.68 --> 177.36
so it's saturday

175.07 --> 184.56
[Music]

177.36 --> 188.31900000000002
the 9th of january 2021

184.56 --> 188.319
and i got two hours for ya

193.84 --> 197.28
so yeah yesterday like i've been pretty

196.48 --> 199.76
much

197.28 --> 201.84
kind of restless all day but it's not

199.76 --> 204.959
unexpected

201.84 --> 204.959
i'm very glad i

206.08 --> 212.56
i did my reply to the show

209.28 --> 214.56
the day before in the way that i did it

212.56 --> 216.48
i haven't watched it back this seems to

214.56 --> 218.959
be a reoccurring problem now that i'm

216.48 --> 221.2
doing two shows

218.959 --> 222.56
it's like wow really sitting through two

221.2 --> 225.76
hours

222.56 --> 228.4
two shows i do one show still what two

225.76 --> 228.39999999999998
hour show

229.12 --> 231.68
words

234.08 --> 238.48000000000002
and yeah it's a lot to watch back

236.56 --> 240.879
especially when i've literally sat

238.48 --> 243.35999999999999
through it all

240.879 --> 245.51899999999998
uh so yeah i don't really watch a lot of

243.36 --> 248.56
shows back

245.519 --> 251.519
it's kind of a a little bit of a

248.56 --> 253.599
downside i think sometimes

251.519 --> 256.23900000000003
because usually when i do watch back my

253.599 --> 258.88
show things turn out better than i

256.239 --> 258.88
expected

264.0 --> 270.8
anyway this yesterday got really

266.8 --> 270.8
technical too with flat earth i think

270.88 --> 275.04
as far as i remember and that was pretty

273.04 --> 278.16
good

275.04 --> 278.16
uh anyway

279.28 --> 284.71999999999997
yesterday flat earth debate was pretty

282.4 --> 284.71999999999997
good

285.6 --> 288.8
proper friday show

290.24 --> 294.16
oh and benjamin is also alive two times

292.88 --> 296.0
by the way in the middle of the night he

294.16 --> 298.8
away that wasn't live

296.0 --> 300.32
he did another interview show with

298.8 --> 302.08
somebody

300.32 --> 304.24
but that was really late so i didn't

302.08 --> 305.919
really watch that all of that i had it

304.24 --> 311.44
kind of in the background because it was

305.919 --> 315.19899999999996
interesting to listen to

311.44 --> 315.199
what terror 306

316.72 --> 323.91900000000004
what right but i did

320.32 --> 325.199
watch some netflix yesterday kind of

323.919 --> 328.71999999999997
rounded out the

325.199 --> 328.72
cobra kai season 3.

329.039 --> 333.36
and yeah the formula is becoming very

331.6 --> 335.36
apparent about it

333.36 --> 337.36
they're just always looking for another

335.36 --> 340.40000000000003
reason to start to

337.36 --> 342.40000000000003
train and duke it out like lots of

340.4 --> 342.71999999999997
conflict and then they all resolve it

342.4 --> 344.08
through

342.72 --> 347.03900000000004
tournament and that seems to be a

344.08 --> 349.84
reoccurring pattern in the series

347.039 --> 350.4
but it is very amusing though and it is

349.84 --> 352.15999999999997
also

350.4 --> 353.84
interes it has interesting character

352.16 --> 355.5
development

353.84 --> 356.88
but it is really like a

355.5 --> 360.0
[Music]

356.88 --> 362.8
a series for people that just keep on

360.0 --> 362.8
duking it out

363.12 --> 367.44
that's really something i started to

364.639 --> 370.0
notice about it but it is very amusing

367.44 --> 372.4
anyway uh hey nathan oakley 9080 good to

370.0 --> 372.4
see you

374.8 --> 380.08
all right uh yeah

377.919 --> 381.19899999999996
let's set through that also watched

380.08 --> 386.24
another movie

381.199 --> 390.08000000000004
last night it kind of caught my eye

386.24 --> 390.08
and called last night's

390.479 --> 394.88
it's an odd movie i think it was kind of

393.28 --> 398.63899999999995
like a sort of a fake

394.88 --> 401.68
tartarian empire setting or something

398.639 --> 403.039
like it was just odd but it was

401.68 --> 406.40000000000003
interesting

403.039 --> 409.52
it was really like a blend of everything

406.4 --> 410.96
but yeah it wasn't

409.52 --> 413.28
i thought it was an interesting movie

410.96 --> 416.0
pretty grim though

413.28 --> 416.0
and yeah

417.68 --> 423.84000000000003
but yeah it was still interesting

425.12 --> 433.039
it was pretty much just a movie about

428.56 --> 435.28000000000003
armies and warrior honor and

433.039 --> 437.12
i don't know i i still thought it was

435.28 --> 439.75899999999996
interesting the way they

437.12 --> 439.759
pulled it off

441.039 --> 446.15999999999997
so yeah watch that yeah it wasn't like

444.56 --> 448.8
the best movie i've ever seen

446.16 --> 450.0
but again it was interesting and the

448.8 --> 453.039
styles were

450.0 --> 456.319
particularly interesting

453.039 --> 457.759
it had a it had distinct asian

456.319 --> 460.56
influences too but

457.759 --> 461.91900000000004
like that's what kind of made it a bit

460.56 --> 464.879
like tartaria

461.919 --> 468.24
the idea of it because it was just

464.879 --> 470.96000000000004
people from all over the place

468.24 --> 472.40000000000003
they even like started out saying that

470.96 --> 475.35999999999996
like oh yeah

472.4 --> 475.919
once like there was a warrior's code or

475.36 --> 480.16
just

475.919 --> 482.87899999999996
very roughly paraphrasing and then yeah

480.16 --> 484.319
it was basically like your heritage your

482.879 --> 487.59900000000005
race didn't matter

484.319 --> 491.28000000000003
sort of the american idea but

487.599 --> 494.24
in there in the sort of medieval setting

491.28 --> 495.52
like everybody's just warriors and your

494.24 --> 498.479
clan and your honor

495.52 --> 500.31899999999996
is more important than that and that's

498.479 --> 503.199
kind of like the setting for it

500.319 --> 504.24
now of course because there were certain

503.199 --> 506.639
very familiar

504.24 --> 508.0
actors in it that did kind of do a

506.639 --> 512.319
decent job

508.0 --> 512.319
but that did make it kind of weird

515.039 --> 519.4399999999999
so yeah it wasn't perfect but i still

517.44 --> 522.08
thought it was interesting anyway

519.44 --> 522.08
that movie

532.839 --> 535.839
what

536.72 --> 551.839
what are you doing

549.12 --> 552.88
right anyway that was pretty much my

551.839 --> 555.44
activities for

552.88 --> 555.4399999999999
last night

560.16 --> 567.6
yes i get it

563.68 --> 570.4799999999999
i just don't see why that's funny really

567.6 --> 571.279
but then again i've never been much of a

570.48 --> 573.519
joker for

571.279 --> 576.8
fooling around jokes like that although

573.519 --> 580.0
i to be fair i do do it myself a little

576.8 --> 583.1999999999999
in other chats when

580.0 --> 584.959
it is going and it's funny and i'm sure

583.2 --> 591.12
that nobody's going to pay too much

584.959 --> 594.399
attention to me

591.12 --> 596.8
yeah but in this jet overall i prefer

594.399 --> 597.76
people just wanting to ask questions and

596.8 --> 604.16
stuff for

597.76 --> 619.8389999999999
reporting out on things but

604.16 --> 619.8389999999999
no harmony

632.079 --> 637.76
yeah i uh yeah mountain smashing i don't

635.279 --> 641.12
know really who you are you

637.76 --> 641.12
you're talking kind of weird

644.16 --> 649.6
because this whole method

647.36 --> 651.36
you know it is there's the scientific

649.6 --> 653.6800000000001
method i don't see why it should be

651.36 --> 656.32
associated

653.68 --> 657.3599999999999
with meth heads like yeah it sounds kind

656.32 --> 660.72
of the same but

657.36 --> 663.279
is that helpful to to put that joke

660.72 --> 664.5600000000001
on that word is that helpful to anyone

663.279 --> 669.2
on our side

664.56 --> 669.1999999999999
on the flatter side no not really

673.44 --> 677.7600000000001
the south celestial pole you my opinion

676.399 --> 683.2
about it

677.76 --> 686.8
yeah it's the other side of the apparent

683.2 --> 689.839
sphere out there the celestial sphere

686.8 --> 689.8389999999999
it's the other side

690.24 --> 698.0790000000001
and it's there

693.68 --> 698.079
so what do you want my opinion about

700.839 --> 703.839
really

704.24 --> 709.6800000000001
what am i supposed to say about it you

706.56 --> 713.1199999999999
think that it's some kind of a

709.68 --> 716.079
a disprove against flat earth because

713.12 --> 717.04
south celestial pole what because you

716.079 --> 720.0
presuppose

717.04 --> 722.639
that we are on a sphere in between this

720.0 --> 725.2
celestial sphere

722.639 --> 730.72
where a sphere underneath that apparent

725.2 --> 734.1600000000001
sphere is that what you're suggesting

730.72 --> 736.24
because i've addressed that endlessly

734.16 --> 738.0
i don't really see why it's an argument

736.24 --> 740.72
against flat earth

738.0 --> 745.6
even though ballers in chat do keep on

740.72 --> 748.48
repeating that over the ages

745.6 --> 749.0400000000001
well you don't understand the fe model

748.48 --> 751.519
because

749.04 --> 752.16
you're all taking it very physical

751.519 --> 755.519
literal and

752.16 --> 756.079
euclidean when there is no claim of such

755.519 --> 758.079
a thing

756.079 --> 759.4399999999999
not on my side anyway there's flat

758.079 --> 762.0
earthers that reify

759.44 --> 765.12
all of it into literal euclidean

762.0 --> 765.12
positions based on

765.36 --> 771.76
a disc presupposing trigonometry

769.2 --> 776.0
doesn't make any of the celestial lights

771.76 --> 776.0
literal objects in the euclidean space

776.8 --> 782.079
they're apparent it's lights and it's

779.76 --> 784.399
not even lights coming from specific

782.079 --> 788.079
positions it's just light manifest

784.399 --> 789.68
that's as far as we can tell at least

788.079 --> 793.12
they're not coming from specific

789.68 --> 796.16
positions just angular

793.12 --> 798.839
locations in relation to the

796.16 --> 801.8389999999999
well to the position on the earth that's

798.839 --> 801.839
it

807.6 --> 815.839
so yeah i just gave you the explanation

811.279 --> 815.8389999999999
anything else i need to clear up for you

821.5 --> 824.809
[Music]

837.76 --> 843.199
it's it really comes down to this it's

840.32 --> 845.6
it's really simple

843.199 --> 849.199
rotating lights in the sky don't prove

845.6 --> 849.1990000000001
you're standing on a spinning ball

849.76 --> 857.8389999999999
it's that simple really

874.56 --> 878.88
you think about it a lot what do you

876.24 --> 878.88
think about it

879.76 --> 885.519
are you really just staring at the sky

882.56 --> 887.5999999999999
for hours so that you'll see an actual

885.519 --> 888.16
rotation in the southern cross you have

887.6 --> 891.1990000000001
that much

888.16 --> 892.8
time to stare at the sky

891.199 --> 895.4399999999999
and think about it and what do you think

892.8 --> 898.56
in all that time well you're seeing that

895.44 --> 903.7600000000001
southern cross rotate in front of you

898.56 --> 903.76
what are you thinking then every night

910.839 --> 913.839
apparently

934.399 --> 943.36
nothing so

938.24 --> 943.36
you just made that up then i guess

952.839 --> 957.12
okay

954.72 --> 959.6
okay right so the southern cross is at a

957.12 --> 960.639
certain angular position in relation to

959.6 --> 964.0
where you are

960.639 --> 964.0
all right well yeah

964.48 --> 968.639
the stars have an angular relation to

967.519 --> 972.88
the observer

968.639 --> 972.88
on the earth that's right

973.759 --> 988.0790000000001
but is there really a lot to think about

982.959 --> 988.079
yeah zack i'm at addressing mountain

994.839 --> 1000.24
smashing

996.56 --> 1003.279
oh so you just engage in the thought

1000.24 --> 1006.399
experiment of presupposing your

1003.279 --> 1009.04
sphere you are on

1006.399 --> 1010.32
a sphere rotating underneath that

1009.04 --> 1013.199
apparent sphere

1010.32 --> 1014.24
of lights in the sky right well that's

1013.199 --> 1017.04
very cute

1014.24 --> 1019.04
if you want to presuppose fantasize all

1017.04 --> 1021.92
day long about how the earth

1019.04 --> 1023.36
should be a ball because that makes it

1021.92 --> 1025.6789999999999
easier for you to

1023.36 --> 1027.919
imagine you're in between a sphere of

1025.679 --> 1031.2800000000002
stars well that's your business

1027.919 --> 1031.2800000000002
doesn't prove anything though

1032.4 --> 1036.4
you know i could fantasize all day long

1035.839 --> 1039.9189999999999
about

1036.4 --> 1042.88
something that is not really real

1039.919 --> 1053.8400000000001
i see that as a waste of time i try to

1042.88 --> 1053.8400000000001
prevent that as much as i can

1056.08 --> 1060.32
look i'm not here to change your mind

1058.24 --> 1061.919
look if you literally want to fantasize

1060.32 --> 1062.96
all day long about how the earth is a

1061.919 --> 1066.5590000000002
ball

1062.96 --> 1068.64
that's fine go ahead you can fantasize

1066.559 --> 1069.6
the rest of your life dearest is a ball

1068.64 --> 1071.76
but

1069.6 --> 1074.08
if you want to do that then i don't see

1071.76 --> 1076.64
why you're coming in this chat to share

1074.08 --> 1076.6399999999999
that with me

1077.36 --> 1081.84
what you want me to break your fantasy

1089.039 --> 1093.28
then what do you the north is the center

1092.4 --> 1096.5590000000002
south

1093.28 --> 1098.559
what no there is no center there's no

1096.559 --> 1101.52
provable center

1098.559 --> 1102.16
that's a part of a presupposition again

1101.52 --> 1105.84
that's the

1102.16 --> 1105.8400000000001
disc presupposition

1106.4 --> 1113.2800000000002
there is no direct proof

1109.679 --> 1117.3600000000001
that the earth is a disk

1113.28 --> 1122.0
it's flat but the orientation is not

1117.36 --> 1125.4399999999998
that apparent

1122.0 --> 1128.88
don't even know what the exact

1125.44 --> 1130.88
euclidean geometry of the equator is

1128.88 --> 1133.2800000000002
i don't know i've asked for that

1130.88 --> 1136.88
question openly many times

1133.28 --> 1138.16
it would be required to figure out the

1136.88 --> 1140.88
orientation

1138.16 --> 1140.88
of the realm

1148.96 --> 1153.2
appearing so the apparent stars that

1152.48 --> 1156.88
apparently

1153.2 --> 1160.32
rotate about your position

1156.88 --> 1161.0390000000002
make you imagine the north and the south

1160.32 --> 1165.84
pole being

1161.039 --> 1168.0
at a center why

1165.84 --> 1169.36
they are not the lights are not coming

1168.0 --> 1172.32
from a specific

1169.36 --> 1172.32
point in space

1172.4 --> 1179.8400000000001
it's only an angular relation in

1174.559 --> 1179.84
relation to the observer's position

1181.6 --> 1189.12
you're just reifying the stars again

1184.96 --> 1192.16
in some kind of euclidean system

1189.12 --> 1194.559
you can't they're not there's no proof

1192.16 --> 1194.559
of this

1196.02 --> 1199.76
[Music]

1197.28 --> 1202.1589999999999
yeah yeah yeah they rotate it's rotated

1199.76 --> 1203.919
rotated rotating lights

1202.159 --> 1205.6000000000001
you can't prove they're in any physical

1203.919 --> 1209.76
literal position though

1205.6 --> 1212.24
you can't you have no proof for this

1209.76 --> 1213.12
it's just angular relations it's all you

1212.24 --> 1221.84
got

1213.12 --> 1221.84
all of it it's the only thing you got

1223.76 --> 1230.24
so yeah it's very cute we live

1226.96 --> 1234.24
underneath an apparent demise fear

1230.24 --> 1237.52
of lights yeah apparent though

1234.24 --> 1240.159
it's not in the euclidean literalness

1237.52 --> 1249.84
any of it so i don't see why you keep on

1240.159 --> 1249.8400000000001
bringing that up

1270.0 --> 1272.559
okay

1275.44 --> 1278.48
yeah oh that's really cute yeah you can

1277.919 --> 1282.7990000000002
see

1278.48 --> 1284.96
both sides of the apparent demisphere

1282.799 --> 1286.8799999999999
rotating

1284.96 --> 1291.8400000000001
that's really cute it doesn't prove

1286.88 --> 1291.8400000000001
anything though

1299.039 --> 1305.84
eight what was all

1307.52 --> 1311.679
so yeah starts rotating yeah that's

1310.559 --> 1315.44
really cute

1311.679 --> 1317.2
so you just want to

1315.44 --> 1319.679
talk all day about how stars are

1317.2 --> 1322.72
rotating apparently

1319.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
in relation to your position or do you

1322.72 --> 1333.84
have some claim to lay

1341.6 --> 1347.84
all right

1358.84 --> 1361.84
uh

1368.72 --> 1371.6000000000001
excuse me

1372.0 --> 1376.799
i'm not patronizing i'm just being

1373.84 --> 1376.799
straightforward

1380.72 --> 1389.84
hey mac hannan

1398.24 --> 1402.32
yeah you're right machadon lights in the

1400.48 --> 1404.72
sky don't

1402.32 --> 1406.3999999999999
validate earth shape what they do

1404.72 --> 1410.08
however is validate the

1406.4 --> 1412.72
orientation between what is

1410.08 --> 1412.72
in the realm

1413.44 --> 1422.0
it does give a concise interconnection

1418.799 --> 1431.84
although how that exactly works is

1422.0 --> 1431.84
a little bit of a mystery

1437.36 --> 1442.1589999999999
i know how it's supposed to work on a

1440.08 --> 1445.4399999999998
ball

1442.159 --> 1447.679
and yeah there are some issues

1445.44 --> 1449.3600000000001
on the earth that do have yeah that

1447.679 --> 1453.919
makes it easier to just

1449.36 --> 1456.3999999999999
approach it like that like a ball

1453.919 --> 1458.24
but yeah the complete orientation of the

1456.4 --> 1473.52
land masses

1458.24 --> 1476.72
is not that cleared up

1473.52 --> 1477.039
yeah here we go again uh not the person

1476.72 --> 1480.799
but

1477.039 --> 1480.799
vince vincent vega

1481.52 --> 1485.679
yeah that's here we go again it's like

1483.84 --> 1489.1999999999998
oh so first you're going to take

1485.679 --> 1491.44
a light that is provably

1489.2 --> 1494.48
coming from a specific position in

1491.44 --> 1497.8400000000001
relation to everything else

1494.48 --> 1497.84
and then coordinate

1498.0 --> 1501.919
yeah well guess what what we see out

1499.679 --> 1504.0
there it's not

1501.919 --> 1505.5200000000002
it's not a light from a specific

1504.0 --> 1515.84
position

1505.52 --> 1515.84
that you can triangulate to it's not

1525.06 --> 1528.2
[Music]

1533.92 --> 1537.069
[Music]

1538.4 --> 1544.48
yeah mountain smashing

1541.679 --> 1545.52
you keep asking the question how do we

1544.48 --> 1547.76
know the north

1545.52 --> 1548.72
center of rotation is the center we

1547.76 --> 1552.559
don't

1548.72 --> 1552.559
there's no proof it is the center

1553.44 --> 1557.8400000000001
you're just assuming that

1575.279 --> 1579.279
could we have two centers how about

1577.44 --> 1581.52
there's no center

1579.279 --> 1582.559
how about that mountain smashing there's

1581.52 --> 1584.559
no center

1582.559 --> 1586.799
there's no central point on the flat

1584.559 --> 1590.1589999999999
earth how about that as an option

1586.799 --> 1591.9189999999999
yeah i have a model

1590.159 --> 1593.279
that accounts for that it's called a

1591.919 --> 1599.8400000000001
rectangular looping

1593.279 --> 1599.84
flat earth there is no center

1600.24 --> 1604.88
there might the equator might be the

1602.48 --> 1607.679
central line

1604.88 --> 1609.3600000000001
potentially if there is no passage

1607.679 --> 1611.039
beyond the north and the south

1609.36 --> 1613.84
at some point if there is a barrier

1611.039 --> 1613.84
there

1614.72 --> 1617.76
but yeah would it interconnect then

1616.96 --> 1621.2
there is

1617.76 --> 1622.48
literally no center there's no euclidean

1621.2 --> 1627.8400000000001
center on the realm

1622.48 --> 1630.96
if the earth is rectangular looping

1627.84 --> 1631.52
so this idea that there is some kind of

1630.96 --> 1635.039
center

1631.52 --> 1641.84
is already part of well

1635.039 --> 1641.84
going towards disk presupposition

1644.399 --> 1648.08
who said north is the center well a

1646.08 --> 1648.6399999999999
whole lot of people say that though [ __ ]

1648.08 --> 1655.84
was all

1648.64 --> 1655.8400000000001
a lot of flat earthers do still say that

1656.399 --> 1660.2399999999998
people like eric dubay and

1660.559 --> 1664.559
i don't know people live globe us

1662.72 --> 1668.159
there's anybody that would

1664.559 --> 1668.72
uh yeah outright just discard the notion

1668.159 --> 1670.72
that

1668.72 --> 1672.799
the the realm might be rectangular

1670.72 --> 1675.1200000000001
looping in some way

1672.799 --> 1675.84
and yeah people ridicule that all over

1675.12 --> 1677.4399999999998
the place

1675.84 --> 1679.84
and have brought it up many times and

1677.44 --> 1682.64
they would always just immediately scoff

1679.84 --> 1684.8799999999999
at it

1682.64 --> 1684.88
so

1695.12 --> 1698.9599999999998
well yeah yeah that's formulated

1697.279 --> 1702.32
correctly the stars all

1698.96 --> 1704.559
just rotate around two not random though

1702.32 --> 1706.0
it's nothing random about it apparent

1704.559 --> 1709.44
points

1706.0 --> 1711.52
yeah it's an apparent sphere

1709.44 --> 1713.279
there my sphere we can only see half of

1711.52 --> 1715.36
it at all times and it's not

1713.279 --> 1717.44
actually a sphere so it's an apparent

1715.36 --> 1719.6789999999999
demisphere of stars

1717.44 --> 1725.8400000000001
that apparently rotate around two

1719.679 --> 1725.8400000000001
apparent points yeah that's correct

1731.52 --> 1738.24
yeah well mountain smashing

1735.279 --> 1739.36
never considered that maybe the earth

1738.24 --> 1741.84
realm

1739.36 --> 1743.12
or even the thing we're standing on that

1741.84 --> 1746.1589999999999
part of it

1743.12 --> 1749.6
is not a definable geometric

1746.159 --> 1751.2
object ever consider that maybe there is

1749.6 --> 1754.24
no

1751.2 --> 1757.6000000000001
object geometry to the earth row maybe

1754.24 --> 1757.6
it's just flat

1761.039 --> 1766.799
maybe it's not a geometrical object ever

1763.52 --> 1769.76
considered that maybe it's just a realm

1766.799 --> 1773.2
it's just a realm there's potential

1769.76 --> 1776.48
looping factors in there

1773.2 --> 1779.2
could be this falsifiable concept

1776.48 --> 1780.0
you can definitely yeah get it out of

1779.2 --> 1782.48
the way

1780.0 --> 1785.279
once and for all by learning the the

1782.48 --> 1785.279
orientation

1785.36 --> 1791.4399999999998
of the equator within the realm

1788.559 --> 1793.44
then you can yeah go on to geometrical

1791.44 --> 1794.0800000000002
deductions from that point on and figure

1793.44 --> 1798.159
out whether

1794.08 --> 1798.1589999999999
space is linear in the first place

1806.84 --> 1809.84
speciality

1817.44 --> 1821.1200000000001
that's a big maybe what are you talking

1819.679 --> 1823.919
about a big maybe no

1821.12 --> 1825.279
no i'm pretty sure the earth realm is

1823.919 --> 1827.76
not a geometric

1825.279 --> 1827.76
object

1829.039 --> 1832.08
it's not a sphere

1832.159 --> 1834.7990000000002
it's flat

1835.6 --> 1840.6399999999999
and i don't know what it is contained in

1838.72 --> 1843.44
whether it is contained within a looping

1840.64 --> 1847.44
system or contained in

1843.44 --> 1851.8400000000001
some kind of a dome or whatever but

1847.44 --> 1851.8400000000001
i do know how to find out

1859.6 --> 1879.84
oh god

1865.2 --> 1879.8400000000001
all right

1900.399 --> 1904.7199999999998
how do you find out well by learning

1903.44 --> 1907.2
what the exact

1904.72 --> 1908.0
geometrical orientation of the equator

1907.2 --> 1911.6000000000001
is

1908.0 --> 1914.96
already said that equator could be

1911.6 --> 1918.799
a straight line which would be

1914.96 --> 1921.3600000000001
a big issue to anybody that would claim

1918.799 --> 1923.44
that space is completely linear

1921.36 --> 1925.76
in this realm and there is no loop

1923.44 --> 1928.0800000000002
because yeah if it's a straight line

1925.76 --> 1929.519
you end up at the same place yet it's

1928.08 --> 1930.32
all flat yeah how are you going to

1929.519 --> 1933.279
explain that

1930.32 --> 1934.0
well i can explain it through a loop

1933.279 --> 1937.039
there's a loop

1934.0 --> 1938.48
east to west if that were just cookie

1937.039 --> 1939.679
cutter the case

1938.48 --> 1941.6
well it could be a little bit more

1939.679 --> 1944.5590000000002
complicated maybe the

1941.6 --> 1946.84
equator line is not a perfectly straight

1944.559 --> 1949.36
line maybe it's an

1946.84 --> 1953.6789999999999
arc right maybe

1949.36 --> 1957.279
it's that

1953.679 --> 1961.2
there may be in yeah an incomplete

1957.279 --> 1961.2
circle so how do you explain that

1961.279 --> 1967.12
it's like euclidean literalness

1964.48 --> 1968.72
spatial linearity is kind of out of the

1967.12 --> 1971.5189999999998
door then too

1968.72 --> 1972.72
now it could turn that it actually is a

1971.519 --> 1975.679
geometrical little

1972.72 --> 1976.32
literal circle but that's not even the

1975.679 --> 1979.3600000000001
end of it

1976.32 --> 1979.36
it's just a start

1980.559 --> 1984.8799999999999
because then you still have to confirm

1982.08 --> 1988.84
if everything from a

1984.88 --> 1990.64
euclidean point of view inside of that

1988.84 --> 1994.24
circle actually

1990.64 --> 1996.3990000000001
fits geometrically inside of that circle

1994.24 --> 1997.519
and does everything outside of that

1996.399 --> 2001.039
circle

1997.519 --> 2005.1200000000001
fit geometrically around that circle

2001.039 --> 2006.96
so there is just a lot to be figured out

2005.12 --> 2008.559
and still have to keep in mind it's all

2006.96 --> 2012.159
flat so yeah maybe

2008.559 --> 2014.6399999999999
the earth realm is like a a donut shape

2012.159 --> 2014.64
like that

2015.679 --> 2019.1200000000001
but it's not literally it's not curved

2018.159 --> 2021.44
anywhere

2019.12 --> 2024.8799999999999
it's just like a donut could be

2021.44 --> 2024.88
potentially the way to

2025.519 --> 2032.32
to geometrically describe

2029.279 --> 2033.519
how the earth realms surface is

2032.32 --> 2037.4399999999998
interconnected

2033.519 --> 2037.44
even though it is all flat yeah

2039.039 --> 2045.279
so oh by the way thank you

2042.72 --> 2046.559
powell broda for the 5 super chat

2045.279 --> 2061.839
donation

2046.559 --> 2061.839
shout out to eric the bay sure why not

2063.76 --> 2070.8
how do you define an equated line well

2066.48 --> 2070.8
how is the equator line even determined

2072.0 --> 2076.639
it wasn't it determined by the yeah the

2075.44 --> 2080.2400000000002
sun where the sun

2076.639 --> 2080.2400000000002
basically is at its highest

2081.839 --> 2087.679
isn't it deduced from the celestial

2085.52 --> 2089.52
yeah the situation with the sun is that

2087.679 --> 2092.2400000000002
not what the equator line really

2089.52 --> 2093.679
is supposed to be so yeah then you go by

2092.24 --> 2095.919
that

2093.679 --> 2096.8
what's the sun's orientation in relation

2095.919 --> 2098.56
to the earth

2096.8 --> 2100.079
where is it at its highest well that's

2098.56 --> 2103.119
where the equator line is

2100.079 --> 2117.8390000000004
and then you just map it all out

2103.119 --> 2117.839
every point that's how you do it

2128.88 --> 2131.839
no

2136.32 --> 2140.6400000000003
i don't think it's about that although

2139.28 --> 2142.96
maybe that could work too

2140.64 --> 2144.0
maybe there is like a you could follow

2142.96 --> 2147.76
the exact middle

2144.0 --> 2150.16
point in between the yeah the celestial

2147.76 --> 2150.1600000000003
poles

2150.24 --> 2159.839
maybe that's the way you could do it as

2151.839 --> 2159.839
well i haven't considered that

2160.72 --> 2164.56
[Music]

2163.119 --> 2167.359
what's what was all there is the

2164.56 --> 2170.16
celestial sphere though

2167.359 --> 2170.72
but yeah there's no it's not euclidean

2170.16 --> 2173.359
it's just

2170.72 --> 2176.0789999999997
lights in relation to the with angular

2173.359 --> 2187.839
relations in relation to the observer's

2176.079 --> 2187.8390000000004
position so

2189.46 --> 2192.59
[Music]

2198.88 --> 2201.839
so

2209.28 --> 2215.92
since the heavens that had pulls

2212.48 --> 2216.32
half poles not the earth well the earth

2215.92 --> 2229.839
has

2216.32 --> 2229.839
magnetic poles i think

2237.79 --> 2240.94
[Music]

2244.88 --> 2248.039
[Music]

2250.09 --> 2253.139
[Music]

2254.839 --> 2257.839
hmm

2259.44 --> 2264.7200000000003
concept in the sky

2262.48 --> 2266.32
it's not just concept there is still

2264.72 --> 2271.4399999999996
lights it's just that

2266.32 --> 2273.839
things that we tend to take for granted

2271.44 --> 2274.48
yeah like that light is coming from a

2273.839 --> 2276.24
specific

2274.48 --> 2277.599
object at all times because that's the

2276.24 --> 2280.56
only thing that we can

2277.599 --> 2282.079
demonstrate to ourselves here in the

2280.56 --> 2284.16
realm

2282.079 --> 2287.8390000000004
unfortunately with the celestial lights

2284.16 --> 2287.839
it doesn't seem to apply

2294.48 --> 2299.839
hey psychics traveler

2301.75 --> 2304.869
[Music]

2308.24 --> 2312.56
follows the great north and east west

2310.88 --> 2316.56
direction

2312.56 --> 2320.16
uh well what if

2316.56 --> 2321.52
yeah that's that's the thing though you

2320.16 --> 2324.16
know

2321.52 --> 2324.88
it's one of the oddities of the angular

2324.16 --> 2327.2
relations

2324.88 --> 2328.0
in relation to the orientation of the

2327.2 --> 2331.1189999999997
earth

2328.0 --> 2333.28
because if yeah if the equator line is

2331.119 --> 2336.4
actually a circle

2333.28 --> 2341.2000000000003
then it's weird because then that would

2336.4 --> 2344.56
effectively mean that the celestial

2341.2 --> 2347.1189999999997
apparent south pole the southern cross

2344.56 --> 2348.16
would literally be as you move over the

2347.119 --> 2352.079
realm

2348.16 --> 2352.0789999999997
it would shift with you

2352.4 --> 2359.52
towards the south direction in relation

2355.44 --> 2359.52
to the apparent north pole point

2359.599 --> 2362.88
or well not even a it would be a literal

2361.839 --> 2364.88
point but yeah that's all

2362.88 --> 2367.599
presuppositional based

2364.88 --> 2368.079
about the orientation well if it's if

2367.599 --> 2371.6800000000003
you take

2368.079 --> 2374.0
it from a rectangular perspective

2371.68 --> 2376.24
then the north is just always north and

2374.0 --> 2379.52
the south is always south and

2376.24 --> 2382.56
the southern cross will always be south

2379.52 --> 2386.56
and the northern

2382.56 --> 2386.56
pole star will simply be north

2387.359 --> 2391.92
yeah the celestial sphere that in that

2389.68 --> 2393.7599999999998
way just becomes anchored

2391.92 --> 2396.64
but that's specifically from a

2393.76 --> 2400.1600000000003
perspective where the equator line is

2396.64 --> 2400.16
just a literal straight line

2402.56 --> 2405.68
it would certainly help the

2404.079 --> 2411.8390000000004
comprehension

2405.68 --> 2411.839
of the celestial apparent sphere

2411.92 --> 2416.8
but yeah remains to be seen whether the

2414.16 --> 2420.3999999999996
equator line is a straight line

2416.8 --> 2425.8390000000004
in order to accommodate us

2420.4 --> 2425.839
with that ease of mind

2435.76 --> 2438.8
from your perspective on a sphere that's

2438.4 --> 2442.2400000000002
so

2438.8 --> 2445.04
cute yeah except that you don't go over

2442.24 --> 2445.04
a curve though

2445.359 --> 2449.92
so yeah i know it's so much easier to

2447.52 --> 2452.96
say but if it is a straight line

2449.92 --> 2456.64
then you must be on a globe

2452.96 --> 2456.64
you're just going to assume that then

2457.28 --> 2460.6400000000003
even though you're not actually going

2458.88 --> 2463.28
over a curve you don't even claim a

2460.64 --> 2464.96
geometric horizon to go over

2463.28 --> 2467.8390000000004
which would be required if you're

2464.96 --> 2470.88
actually moving over a ball

2467.839 --> 2472.72
be constantly changing angles over time

2470.88 --> 2474.48
going over that curve you're not you're

2472.72 --> 2476.48
just going in a straight line and then

2474.48 --> 2478.319
yeah potentially ending up in exactly

2476.48 --> 2482.319
the same place you started out

2478.319 --> 2486.56
without turning 360 degrees

2482.319 --> 2488.48
over your travel yeah

2486.56 --> 2490.4
that's not gonna prove a ball it's just

2488.48 --> 2495.839
gonna prove you went in an exact

2490.4 --> 2495.839
straight line over a flat surface

2509.28 --> 2512.3190000000004
yeah i'm not being patronizing i'm just

2511.359 --> 2516.16
being very

2512.319 --> 2517.2
direct i'm sorry you don't like that i'm

2516.16 --> 2520.24
sorry it hurts

2517.2 --> 2520.8799999999997
that you thought you had some kind of

2520.24 --> 2523.9199999999996
solid

2520.88 --> 2524.7200000000003
last minute footing for the globe you

2523.92 --> 2528.079
don't

2524.72 --> 2528.0789999999997
the earth is not a globe

2530.72 --> 2536.8799999999997
every detail every detail

2534.079 --> 2538.1600000000003
in the realm this proves it everything

2536.88 --> 2541.76
disproves the globe

2538.16 --> 2545.1189999999997
everything disproves it so the globers

2541.76 --> 2546.3190000000004
have just utilized any kind of way to

2545.119 --> 2550.48
twist

2546.319 --> 2553.04
words and logic and even fabricate

2550.48 --> 2554.16
machinations in order to just make

2553.04 --> 2556.079
believe

2554.16 --> 2565.839
make it okay for you to believe it's a

2556.079 --> 2565.8390000000004
globe anyway

2568.96 --> 2573.68
we should travel to the equator and

2570.8 --> 2578.0
explore well we should yes

2573.68 --> 2580.24
somebody should

2578.0 --> 2581.92
i don't think it's we're gonna get a lot

2580.24 --> 2592.4799999999996
of help with that

2581.92 --> 2594.56
you know oh

2592.48 --> 2597.2
well mountain smashing if you don't like

2594.56 --> 2599.7599999999998
my vernacular

2597.2 --> 2600.24
i could also just ban you it's not like

2599.76 --> 2603.3590000000004
you've

2600.24 --> 2605.7599999999998
contributed a lot

2603.359 --> 2607.52
if you're gonna play victim over my use

2605.76 --> 2610.2400000000002
of words well you can't just

2607.52 --> 2610.96
also [ __ ] off then how about that how

2610.24 --> 2613.359
about some

2610.96 --> 2621.839
actual patronizing if you don't like it

2613.359 --> 2621.839
you can [ __ ] off how about that

2622.52 --> 2626.0
[Music]

2623.76 --> 2635.8390000000004
or you can just stop complaining and

2626.0 --> 2635.839
actually get back to the arguments

2643.39 --> 2646.52
[Music]

2646.839 --> 2652.64
so

2649.119 --> 2656.4
no oh we have to be careful because

2652.64 --> 2660.4
mountain smashing was being nice to me

2656.4 --> 2664.8
and if i don't if i don't stop

2660.4 --> 2667.76
using mean words then he's going to be

2664.8 --> 2668.6400000000003
much less nice i'm so afraid of that

2667.76 --> 2676.1600000000003
terrible

2668.64 --> 2678.96
terrible terrifying

2676.16 --> 2681.68
you started every topic oh you mean you

2678.96 --> 2685.04
you tried to insert

2681.68 --> 2687.2799999999997
your question about stars and everything

2685.04 --> 2688.16
assuming that that proves the globe

2687.28 --> 2690.0
because it does

2688.16 --> 2691.52
you can deny it but that's where the

2690.0 --> 2694.64
whole conversation was

2691.52 --> 2696.16
going at and now that in the end i

2694.64 --> 2698.0
basically

2696.16 --> 2699.359
swipe it off the table give you every

2698.0 --> 2703.2
reason why and now

2699.359 --> 2706.4
now you have some demands do you

2703.2 --> 2709.7599999999998
no yeah just because

2706.4 --> 2711.2000000000003
you were in chat chatting and i was

2709.76 --> 2715.5200000000004
responding to you

2711.2 --> 2718.16
doesn't mean that i owe you yeah

2715.52 --> 2720.4
i don't owe you anything you just came

2718.16 --> 2720.3999999999996
here

2721.52 --> 2725.7599999999998
we can have a nice conversation can have

2724.24 --> 2730.0
a debate even

2725.76 --> 2730.0
but i don't owe you anything

2730.839 --> 2733.839
okay

2734.34 --> 2738.96
[Music]

2736.4 --> 2740.7400000000002
now there's plenty people in chat that i

2738.96 --> 2742.48
do owe something to

2740.74 --> 2744.9599999999996
[Music]

2742.48 --> 2747.839
because they deserved it and i know who

2744.96 --> 2747.839
they are

2748.48 --> 2751.68
and they know who i am

2752.64 --> 2758.64
oh yeah well okay yeah yeah i will

2756.16 --> 2759.359
i'm a [ __ ] bloke yeah and i am going to

2758.64 --> 2762.319
ban you

2759.359 --> 2763.119
because apparently you don't you can't

2762.319 --> 2768.24
handle

2763.119 --> 2775.839
me right the earth is not a globe

2768.24 --> 2775.839
you understand earth is not a globe

2776.56 --> 2779.68
so good luck with that

2779.839 --> 2784.56
there's still plenty of global hangouts

2782.64 --> 2786.72
around where you can say oh look

2784.56 --> 2788.24
the flat earthers have no proof for

2786.72 --> 2791.359
their flat earth because

2788.24 --> 2793.2
these stars are a globe

2791.359 --> 2794.7999999999997
and it only makes sense to me on the

2793.2 --> 2797.359
globe yeah yeah i bet you'll be

2794.8 --> 2803.8390000000004
very beloved over there they'll love it

2797.359 --> 2803.839
so why don't you just go over there then

2807.49 --> 2810.6099999999997
[Music]

2814.839 --> 2817.839
so

2826.48 --> 2831.839
yeah the argument was bled dry anyway

2833.52 --> 2837.28
every point about it was pretty much

2842.839 --> 2845.839
made

2870.839 --> 2875.04
uh

2873.119 --> 2876.7200000000003
i can't believe that he actually got

2875.04 --> 2881.119
really offended for

2876.72 --> 2881.1189999999997
me calling his argument cute

2881.68 --> 2887.2
and of course that is patronizing it

2885.359 --> 2888.72
it's like the mildest form of

2887.2 --> 2892.5589999999997
patronizing you could

2888.72 --> 2897.4399999999996
that i can think of without just

2892.559 --> 2900.2400000000002
getting overtly offensive so my god

2897.44 --> 2902.8
talk about oversensitive there it's kind

2900.24 --> 2902.7999999999997
of sad

2908.8 --> 2915.2000000000003
who created a globe bs concept was it a

2911.92 --> 2918.4
polish guy what

2915.2 --> 2919.52
no i think that the globe system is very

2918.4 --> 2922.319
old

2919.52 --> 2923.28
i think it's potentially ancient and

2922.319 --> 2929.839
then they just

2923.28 --> 2929.8390000000004
unleashed the math on it

2933.44 --> 2938.079
hey here we go again good to see you

2941.2 --> 2945.839
why would you think that a polish guy

2943.359 --> 2948.34
invented it that's just weird

2945.839 --> 2951.459
where did you come up with that

2948.34 --> 2951.4590000000003
[Music]

2953.76 --> 2960.1600000000003
oh look at that nice

2957.76 --> 2961.44
see that's what it was like in the

2960.16 --> 2964.3999999999996
morning

2961.44 --> 2964.4
it's just beautiful

2967.52 --> 2971.839
but it is cold

2998.559 --> 3004.7200000000003
the copernic copernicus you think

3001.92 --> 3007.76
copernicus came up with the globe

3004.72 --> 3012.0
really i

3007.76 --> 3014.4
i highly doubt it

3012.0 --> 3016.64
like these people that have been put

3014.4 --> 3019.599
into the front row

3016.64 --> 3020.24
of history of who supposedly work

3019.599 --> 3022.88
towards

3020.24 --> 3025.5989999999997
science in the globe they're just actors

3022.88 --> 3025.599
playing out

3025.76 --> 3030.88
a slow build-up to get some kind of

3029.04 --> 3032.72
convincing story out of it

3030.88 --> 3034.6400000000003
like oh this is how they develop out of

3032.72 --> 3038.0
it all that [ __ ] was

3034.64 --> 3040.16
fully developed before that time

3038.0 --> 3043.8
it was already pretty much worked out a

3040.16 --> 3047.04
lot of it these people were just

3043.8 --> 3050.319
trying to get

3047.04 --> 3054.5589999999997
this in and then at some point

3050.319 --> 3057.2
just it was just decided

3054.559 --> 3059.52
so it was basically to me just theo

3057.2 --> 3060.319
theatrics at the time when people were

3059.52 --> 3063.599
absolutely

3060.319 --> 3065.839
having none of that just theatrics

3063.599 --> 3068.2400000000002
to get people used to it and then the

3065.839 --> 3071.2
church just at some point

3068.24 --> 3071.9199999999996
decided like yeah we are going to pursue

3071.2 --> 3075.7599999999998
this

3071.92 --> 3078.2400000000002
along the old religious belief

3075.76 --> 3083.0400000000004
and then they just started to move

3078.24 --> 3087.2
towards that

3083.04 --> 3087.2
and then the big bang came in 60s

3092.96 --> 3096.8
but these people that have front row

3095.839 --> 3100.5589999999997
argued

3096.8 --> 3103.28
for heliocentrism and all that

3100.559 --> 3105.76
they were they're just actors as pj

3103.28 --> 3108.88
would say they were just

3105.76 --> 3111.2000000000003
introducing it most or

3108.88 --> 3114.319
a lot of it was already worked out the

3111.2 --> 3114.319
arguments were already

3122.839 --> 3125.839
building

3131.92 --> 3139.2000000000003
antichrist would be french oh i missed

3134.72 --> 3153.839
that one mechanic

3139.2 --> 3153.839
the count of antichrist

3155.599 --> 3157.92
all right

3163.52 --> 3166.559
oh i really hope that sun's still gonna

3165.839 --> 3168.48
be there

3166.559 --> 3171.52
after the show is rounding out i would

3168.48 --> 3171.52
really like to go out

3171.839 --> 3176.0789999999997
some grocery shopping in this nice

3178.839 --> 3183.839
sunlight

3180.319 --> 3184.96
carl sagan theory mccann i don't even

3183.839 --> 3187.68
know what his

3184.96 --> 3187.68
theory is

3188.48 --> 3195.839
i didn't even know he had a very

3190.4 --> 3195.839
consistent theory

3206.839 --> 3209.839
so

3212.8 --> 3217.76
yeah it was a funny one i agree matt

3215.359 --> 3217.7599999999998
cannon

3221.68 --> 3228.72
hey thank you again paul

3224.96 --> 3228.7200000000003
or didn't give it before

3231.28 --> 3235.28
yeah you did yeah thank you again paul

3233.359 --> 3238.48
broda for the five dollar super chat

3235.28 --> 3244.1600000000003
donation what is light

3238.48 --> 3244.16
it's not a wave i don't think it is a

3244.24 --> 3254.4799999999996
minimum sized particle either

3250.72 --> 3257.1189999999997
and i definitely don't think that

3254.48 --> 3260.0
the photoelectric effect proves that it

3257.119 --> 3260.0
is a particle

3260.8 --> 3264.7200000000003
that was mentioned why was it mentioned

3262.48 --> 3267.44
again by kiwi somewhere in

3264.72 --> 3268.8799999999997
last week i think just i don't really

3267.44 --> 3270.559
feel like going against it

3268.88 --> 3272.559
because then it's just gonna get all

3270.559 --> 3275.8390000000004
pissy again

3272.559 --> 3278.4
i've already explained why i think light

3275.839 --> 3281.52
is not a particle

3278.4 --> 3281.52
and not a wave

3283.599 --> 3287.28
because i think it's it has an

3285.44 --> 3290.079
infinitely divisible nature

3287.28 --> 3291.0400000000004
and so it regarded just regarded as a a

3290.079 --> 3294.2400000000002
beam of

3291.04 --> 3294.24
infinitely divisible

3294.64 --> 3297.839
photonic energy

3298.64 --> 3302.0
and it moves in beams

3302.16 --> 3306.24
not in waves not in ripples because yeah

3305.04 --> 3308.4
those assumptions

3306.24 --> 3308.3999999999996
are

3309.68 --> 3317.1189999999997
are easy to make mathematically at least

3313.92 --> 3317.92
and yeah with it is also involved the

3317.119 --> 3322.4
more

3317.92 --> 3324.88
upfront example for that would be the uh

3322.4 --> 3324.88
is it the

3325.599 --> 3329.119
the diffraction cascade or what is it

3328.559 --> 3333.119
called again

3329.119 --> 3336.1600000000003
from the double split double slit

3333.119 --> 3336.799
double split double slit experiment

3336.16 --> 3340.48
result

3336.799 --> 3344.559
just light refracting in the

3340.48 --> 3346.839
wave pattern what's it called i'm i'm

3344.559 --> 3349.119
really bad at my english today this is

3346.839 --> 3352.64
terrible

3349.119 --> 3352.6400000000003
i hope you guys can follow me

3354.4 --> 3358.319
it's the the wave like pattern

3358.799 --> 3362.24
it's not actually because it's a wave

3360.96 --> 3365.68
it's just

3362.24 --> 3368.24
math can explain it as a pattern

3365.68 --> 3370.3999999999996
as a wave like pattern it's easier to

3368.24 --> 3372.72
explain that way it is not though it's

3370.4 --> 3377.839
not actually a wave

3372.72 --> 3377.839
so proof of that

3400.16 --> 3404.799
oh my god vincent vega what are you

3403.119 --> 3407.52
whining about stop bothering

3404.799 --> 3407.52
mack hannon

3415.839 --> 3420.16
it's so very cute measuring angles to a

3418.079 --> 3422.1600000000003
central point yeah

3420.16 --> 3423.2
people can do that and he can do that

3422.16 --> 3425.44
too it's just

3423.2 --> 3426.8799999999997
you can't really do that with celestial

3425.44 --> 3428.799
objects though

3426.88 --> 3430.319
if you're talking about the entire earth

3428.799 --> 3435.44
realm

3430.319 --> 3435.44
yeah there's going to be presuppositions

3444.839 --> 3451.2799999999997
involved

3446.24 --> 3451.2799999999997
his previous comment what from when

3453.44 --> 3461.839
from like 15 minutes ago

3481.58 --> 3484.7599999999998
[Music]

3486.839 --> 3489.839
uh

3497.119 --> 3502.319
hmm why do the wandering stars look the

3501.28 --> 3507.599
same when

3502.319 --> 3507.599
zoomed in on only bigger

3511.119 --> 3515.04
right because they're not euclidean

3512.96 --> 3518.16
objects you can't actually

3515.04 --> 3521.7599999999998
increase your angular

3518.16 --> 3524.0
resolution limit issues by zooming in

3521.76 --> 3526.0
like you could for example with a boat

3524.0 --> 3527.599
appearing to disappear in the horizon

3526.0 --> 3529.119
right you can zoom in on that and then

3527.599 --> 3531.2000000000003
you see it again

3529.119 --> 3533.839
it doesn't work like that with the stars

3531.2 --> 3535.839
because that only works

3533.839 --> 3537.119
when angular resolution limit is

3535.839 --> 3540.72
actually an issue

3537.119 --> 3544.6400000000003
which is when it's an actual object in a

3540.72 --> 3546.319
euclidean position and yeah

3544.64 --> 3548.5589999999997
if it doesn't do that with the wandering

3546.319 --> 3549.839
stars or any of it that just goes to

3548.559 --> 3553.92
show its

3549.839 --> 3557.359
perspective doesn't apply euclidean

3553.92 --> 3560.0
spatiality don't apply because

3557.359 --> 3562.319
if it were then when you zoom in you

3560.0 --> 3565.68
would start to see more detail

3562.319 --> 3565.68
like that and you don't

3570.88 --> 3575.839
because it's not light coming from being

3574.319 --> 3578.0
visible

3575.839 --> 3578.88
because light is reflecting off or

3578.0 --> 3581.68
whatever

3578.88 --> 3584.319
from a specific object in a euclidean

3581.68 --> 3586.72
location in relation to the observer

3584.319 --> 3588.72
so that if you zoom in on it you would

3586.72 --> 3589.4399999999996
increase the angular resolution limit

3588.72 --> 3593.839
and all that

3589.44 --> 3593.839
stuff and then you would see more

3594.079 --> 3600.88
that doesn't happen because

3597.359 --> 3603.119
yeah it's not something you can actually

3600.88 --> 3605.92
as an object zoom in on and then get

3603.119 --> 3605.92
more details

3606.4 --> 3612.1600000000003
you just got these the light signature

3609.44 --> 3612.64
as a holographic side effect of just

3612.16 --> 3616.24
looking

3612.64 --> 3618.5589999999997
in the light's direction that's how i

3616.24 --> 3618.5589999999997
see it

3619.92 --> 3624.079
it's like a little hologram that just

3622.0 --> 3627.44
appears to be there

3624.079 --> 3629.599
and there is light coming from it from

3627.44 --> 3631.359
where it appears to be from that angle

3629.599 --> 3632.799
there comes light from it in relation to

3631.359 --> 3635.7599999999998
the observer

3632.799 --> 3637.68
but it's just like a side effect like a

3635.76 --> 3640.079
little stamp like a signature a

3637.68 --> 3643.9199999999996
holographic signature

3640.079 --> 3645.44
of that specific light it's not actually

3643.92 --> 3647.28
the object

3645.44 --> 3649.599
you are seeing from which the light

3647.28 --> 3653.0400000000004
comes it just appears like that

3649.599 --> 3656.4
if you imagine it to be it's just

3653.04 --> 3656.88
light signature more like a lens flare

3656.4 --> 3658.88
than an

3656.88 --> 3661.599
actual object from which the light

3658.88 --> 3661.599
originates

3679.839 --> 3686.96
well vincent fagat

3684.4 --> 3688.88
geometry is geometry and math is math

3686.96 --> 3691.68
math

3688.88 --> 3694.48
can apply to geometry not all geometry

3691.68 --> 3699.52
can apply to math because math is purely

3694.48 --> 3705.599
like numerical conceptual

3699.52 --> 3705.599
geometry has more distinct rules

3708.799 --> 3712.079
so yeah sure it's classified with

3711.28 --> 3716.4
mathematics

3712.079 --> 3716.4
but it's not the same thing exactly

3723.44 --> 3726.799
what the [ __ ] do i look like i'm in the

3725.52 --> 3729.0389999999998
hospital

3726.799 --> 3732.0
or have been when when did that

3729.039 --> 3732.0
supposedly happen

3732.4 --> 3736.4
i was here on my show yesterday i'm

3734.48 --> 3738.0
gonna be here tomorrow on the show so

3736.4 --> 3740.4
what are you talking about

3738.0 --> 3755.839
some baller told you something stupid

3740.4 --> 3755.839
and you believed it

3766.319 --> 3771.92
that's just a stupid sock account

3768.24 --> 3771.9199999999996
introducing stupid questions

3772.559 --> 3776.88
because people have no real questions

3774.559 --> 3776.88
left

3777.28 --> 3782.0
you know in the end i feel like a

3779.68 --> 3785.2
complete idiot

3782.0 --> 3787.52
i do because i thought

3785.2 --> 3789.0389999999998
i'm just going to be a teacher that can

3787.52 --> 3792.16
answer

3789.039 --> 3795.039
heavy complicated heavy

3792.16 --> 3796.72
complicated to imagine to figure it out

3795.039 --> 3798.88
to see it

3796.72 --> 3800.319
things in the realm and just explain it

3798.88 --> 3803.44
then people will just all

3800.319 --> 3804.24
line up and ask questions well it turns

3803.44 --> 3807.2000000000003
out that most

3804.24 --> 3808.799
people don't line up to ask questions

3807.2 --> 3810.64
because it either gives them a headache

3808.799 --> 3811.839
it makes them feel incompetent it makes

3810.64 --> 3815.68
them feel like they know

3811.839 --> 3819.0389999999998
too little so they just come here

3815.68 --> 3822.319
to try and see if they can win

3819.039 --> 3823.92
with their belief over my insight

3822.319 --> 3826.319
that doesn't really work that seems to

3823.92 --> 3828.96
be mostly the case

3826.319 --> 3830.72
and it is kind of disappointing because

3828.96 --> 3833.68
i feel like i got all this stuff and

3830.72 --> 3833.68
nobody wants it

3836.64 --> 3842.0
although some people do want it i think

3839.76 --> 3843.8390000000004
others do appreciate it it's just that

3842.0 --> 3845.039
the vast majority just doesn't really

3843.839 --> 3846.96
want it

3845.039 --> 3853.8390000000004
it gives me on average the feeling like

3846.96 --> 3853.839
i'm just wasting my time here

3866.559 --> 3870.559
yeah don't troll

3870.72 --> 3873.9199999999996
favorite ripple in the ether yeah that's

3872.64 --> 3876.319
hilarious

3873.92 --> 3878.7200000000003
yeah that was a little joke from uh from

3876.319 --> 3882.16
adam meekin

3878.72 --> 3884.0789999999997
although look a ripple in the ether

3882.16 --> 3885.44
there may still be an ether it's just

3884.079 --> 3889.119
not a light medium

3885.44 --> 3890.0
that's all you know i see the electrical

3889.119 --> 3894.1600000000003
ether as

3890.0 --> 3897.359
a valid thing

3894.16 --> 3898.48
i don't know everything about electrics

3897.359 --> 3901.0389999999998
but i think that

3898.48 --> 3902.88
there is potentially an electric ether

3901.039 --> 3909.599
and if i could be a ripple in that i

3902.88 --> 3911.76
don't mind

3909.599 --> 3912.88
oh by the way thank you again paul broda

3911.76 --> 3914.88
for the five

3912.88 --> 3923.839
dollar super chat donation meth the

3914.88 --> 3923.839
nature's poor way of description yeah

3926.96 --> 3932.079
yeah math is in that sense just like

3929.2 --> 3935.4399999999996
language it's used to describe

3932.079 --> 3936.0
focusing on other aspects but just like

3935.44 --> 3940.16
you can

3936.0 --> 3942.88
describe something incorrectly or

3940.16 --> 3943.92
yeah weirdly you can do the same with

3942.88 --> 3948.1600000000003
math and describe

3943.92 --> 3952.559
things that are obviously not true

3948.16 --> 3952.5589999999997
or just rest on certain assumptions

3954.319 --> 3957.52
and you can do that with regular

3955.839 --> 3959.68
language too

3957.52 --> 3962.079
doesn't make it true doesn't mean that

3959.68 --> 3965.839
if you can describe something

3962.079 --> 3965.8390000000004
with math that it is true

3966.72 --> 3971.2
must it all mostly depends just on what

3969.359 --> 3975.359
you're going to

3971.2 --> 3979.839
accept as a foundation

3975.359 --> 3979.839
as a vantage point for

3979.92 --> 3993.839
for the math for the idea for the thing

3983.28 --> 3993.8390000000004
you're trying to describe

3996.16 --> 4001.44
that you just don't understand uh yeah

3999.039 --> 4007.8390000000004
mckinnon don't listen to him he's just

4001.44 --> 4007.839
whining whining lower

4008.48 --> 4013.119
it's just somebody trying to use their

4010.4 --> 4016.2400000000002
education as a weapon of peer pressure

4013.119 --> 4018.799
to try and gasps like flat earthers

4016.24 --> 4021.52
to make them feel stupid and give up so

4018.799 --> 4025.28
that they can reign supreme in their

4021.52 --> 4027.52
lies and delusion going along to get

4025.28 --> 4029.8390000000004
along [ __ ]

4027.52 --> 4030.72

other people out of what they're doing

4035.44 --> 4049.839
in this world it's normalized

4039.039 --> 4049.8390000000004

4190.4 --> 4192.719
internet meme

4191.44 --> 4203.839999999999
who are you talking about there

4192.719 --> 4203.84
reminiscent stone

4214.84 --> 4217.84
one

4233.12 --> 4236.0
oh right

4241.92 --> 4245.84
you mean vincent vega

4246.8 --> 4250.88
is he really worth making a meme over

4251.12 --> 4259.84
go ahead the guy just seems to be

4254.159 --> 4259.839999999999
trying to out matt mccannon

4260.239 --> 4273.839999999999
and gaslighting him

4280.48 --> 4284.239
what are you talking about stone monkey

4284.84 --> 4290.2390000000005
3d

4286.719 --> 4294.32
how do you know what do you know him

4290.239 --> 4294.32
are you one of these people

4294.4 --> 4301.839999999999
he's already explained it so what are

4296.56 --> 4301.84
you whining about

4304.32 --> 4308.96
no you work in construction so it's

4306.719 --> 4311.52
always the same everything everybody

4308.96 --> 4312.64
in construction always does exactly the

4311.52 --> 4316.040000000001
same things right

4312.64 --> 4319.12
all the time there's no

4316.04 --> 4323.28
compartmentalization that ever happens

4319.12 --> 4323.28
like mack hannan said

4325.52 --> 4330.88
it seems like you're drawing premature

4327.84 --> 4330.88
conclusions there

4338.64 --> 4345.84
like why do you even have why would you

4342.32 --> 4349.36
pile on to that is that some kind of

4345.84 --> 4350.719
baller thing if one baller attacks a

4349.36 --> 4352.4
flat earther for

4350.719 --> 4354.0
thinking that they are pretending to

4352.4 --> 4371.839999999999
have a job and then that's

4354.0 --> 4371.84
undoable so you're just piling on there

4380.56 --> 4385.84
i don't see it stone monkey 3d

4388.08 --> 4395.76
look you even got him rolling it all out

4391.199 --> 4397.919999999999
mac hannan that you shouldn't do that

4395.76 --> 4399.84
you shouldn't you should not even hand

4397.92 --> 4400.96
because they're just trying to gaslight

4399.84 --> 4402.400000000001
you

4400.96 --> 4404.2390000000005
they're just saying like oh no you're

4402.4 --> 4406.96
not good they always do that

4404.239 --> 4409.199
right you can't trust ballers with that

4406.96 --> 4409.199
[ __ ]

4409.76 --> 4412.88
you know there's ballers out there that

4411.44 --> 4416.4
literally just tried to

4412.88 --> 4417.92
draw data out of you

4416.4 --> 4419.599999999999
and some of them out there not saying

4417.92 --> 4420.4
that these people in chat currently do

4419.6 --> 4424.84
that

4420.4 --> 4426.48
actually try to use that to get people

4424.84 --> 4429.52
fired

4426.48 --> 4431.919999999999
so i'd not be as enthusiastic to

4429.52 --> 4433.280000000001
literally put down your entire life just

4431.92 --> 4434.88
to prove that

4433.28 --> 4441.84
you're actually what you're saying you

4434.88 --> 4441.84
are because i don't trust these people

4460.239 --> 4468.4
yeah vince vega you can go [ __ ] off now

4463.36 --> 4483.839999999999
scumbag you're a scumbag

4468.4 --> 4483.839999999999
there's enough prodding already

4488.8 --> 4493.679
he's just trying to gaslight you just

4491.28 --> 4497.92
getting you in a position where you feel

4493.679 --> 4500.0
uncomfortable about your own qualities

4497.92 --> 4501.76
and he will just keep on prodding and

4500.0 --> 4504.159
prodding and prodding and prodding

4501.76 --> 4505.679
until there's nothing left of you but

4504.159 --> 4508.839999999999
feeling miserable

4505.679 --> 4511.4400000000005
because that's what they do they're

4508.84 --> 4514.96
scumbags

4511.44 --> 4517.199
yeah and they probably should be

4514.96 --> 4520.96
considering

4517.199 --> 4521.678999999999
i don't know doing something else with

4520.96 --> 4523.84
their life

4521.679 --> 4525.04
except trying to make other people

4523.84 --> 4528.88
miserable

4525.04 --> 4532.159
because they refuse to lie to your face

4528.88 --> 4539.84
about what reality is huh

4532.159 --> 4542.0
how about that

4539.84 --> 4543.28
yeah i know mac hannan i'm just trying

4542.0 --> 4545.28
to spare you from that

4543.28 --> 4547.5199999999995
because it was already going on long

4545.28 --> 4547.5199999999995
enough

4547.6 --> 4553.84
it was just getting all whiny anyway so

4554.86 --> 4560.709
[Music]

4568.04 --> 4571.18
[Music]

4577.44 --> 4581.839999999999
a broom pusher

4585.12 --> 4589.28
hello random explorer what what do you

4592.84 --> 4595.84
mean

4640.08 --> 4643.36
wait who are we talking about

4643.92 --> 4649.1990000000005
are you saying that vincent vega was

4646.96 --> 4649.199
that

4649.44 --> 4652.32
did he say that

4656.08 --> 4662.88
yeah yeah so yeah i didn't even

4659.44 --> 4665.839999999999
read i didn't even see that

4662.88 --> 4665.84
that's just silly

4670.64 --> 4675.52
all right you're so you're just at

4672.64 --> 4675.52
homing him then

4675.84 --> 4682.8
all right not very productive

4679.679 --> 4682.8
i don't know what he was

4685.39 --> 4688.469
[Music]

4688.64 --> 4692.0
i just know he was a very whiny baller

4690.64 --> 4695.6
and he fell into typical

4692.0 --> 4696.719
baller patterns gaslighting peer

4695.6 --> 4700.0
pressure

4696.719 --> 4702.64
being a piece of [ __ ] not

4700.0 --> 4703.92
stopping because yeah there are some

4702.64 --> 4706.4800000000005
virtual wins to be

4703.92 --> 4709.12
gained in the face of your utter defeat

4706.48 --> 4711.12
of your cosmology that you believe in

4709.12 --> 4721.84
so yeah it's no wonder you're going to

4711.12 --> 4721.84
be like that

4725.44 --> 4729.759999999999
yeah buddy i don't know who's making

4727.92 --> 4731.679
these stupid sock accounts with stupid

4729.76 --> 4735.6
remarks but you can stick a socks up

4731.679 --> 4738.96
your ass

4735.6 --> 4740.56
get a point get a life get some real

4738.96 --> 4749.12
questions

4740.56 --> 4752.320000000001
stop bothering me

4749.12 --> 4754.32
oh best tickles right

4752.32 --> 4757.84
so if the earth is stationary what holds

4754.32 --> 4760.96
it in place in relation to what

4757.84 --> 4777.84
vas tacless in relation to what is the

4760.96 --> 4777.84
earth supposed to be held in place

4791.43 --> 4794.529
[Music]

4804.8 --> 4808.159000000001
bible states four pillars right dutch

4807.44 --> 4810.159
sailor but

4808.159 --> 4812.48
those four pillars i don't think that's

4810.159 --> 4816.159
th those are what supposedly

4812.48 --> 4818.879999999999
hold up the sky right it's not

4816.159 --> 4821.599999999999
holding up the earth i don't think there

4818.88 --> 4821.6
is anything

4821.679 --> 4827.6
there there is just the limited space

4825.12 --> 4830.4
and that just plays in again to the

4827.6 --> 4833.52
rectangular looping system a confined

4830.4 --> 4836.879999999999
limited amount of space

4833.52 --> 4840.159000000001
beyond outside of which

4836.88 --> 4843.1990000000005
nothing exists no space

4840.159 --> 4845.759999999999
nothing no actual

4843.199 --> 4846.719
space for a physical matter to even go

4845.76 --> 4852.08
into

4846.719 --> 4852.08
or towards just nothing no room

4852.639 --> 4857.4400000000005
a limited amount of space so why would

4856.08 --> 4861.84
it be resting on anything

4857.44 --> 4861.839999999999
when there is nothing else

4867.92 --> 4872.2390000000005
right and look if george sanford even

4870.08 --> 4876.159
the whole back of a turtle thing

4872.239 --> 4879.599999999999
when you inquire with priests

4876.159 --> 4880.638999999999
hindu priests that say that they will

4879.6 --> 4884.2390000000005
admit to you

4880.639 --> 4886.8
they don't know they're just saying that

4884.239 --> 4887.5199999999995
because people keep asking those types

4886.8 --> 4889.28
of questions

4887.52 --> 4890.8
it's like a six-year-old question just

4889.28 --> 4893.679
keep on going and go and go

4890.8 --> 4894.320000000001
so they just start they just say that

4893.679 --> 4896.88
they don't

4894.32 --> 4899.679
know it there's no official record of

4896.88 --> 4904.8
what's supposed to be resting on

4899.679 --> 4904.8
no indian says that oh

4905.12 --> 4911.199
hindu but like real hindu officials

4908.8 --> 4912.08
priests temple priests don't say that

4911.199 --> 4914.4
either when it's

4912.08 --> 4914.4
ass

4915.12 --> 4917.84
i don't know

4918.56 --> 4923.52
i have very little modern update of what

4921.04 --> 4923.5199999999995
is said

4926.56 --> 4931.84
native american indian okay either way

4935.36 --> 4941.12
okay okay tara 306 if you say so

4939.52 --> 4944.0
i don't know who would be saying that

4941.12 --> 4946.159
maybe it was just all completely made up

4944.0 --> 4948.639
maybe it was all hundred percent

4946.159 --> 4950.799999999999
controlled opposition

4948.639 --> 4952.0
suggestion placement by jesuits

4950.8 --> 4954.56
everywhere and

4952.0 --> 4957.04
none of it is actually said maybe was

4954.56 --> 4958.8
all a bluff about what the world says

4957.04 --> 4961.28
what everybody everywhere says it was

4958.8 --> 4965.12
all a bluff all along

4961.28 --> 4965.12
and nobody even thinks about that

4965.28 --> 4968.719
i don't know i've never been to india

4968.4 --> 4970.5599999999995
and

4968.719 --> 4972.8
asked people like what do you think the

4970.56 --> 4975.120000000001
earth is resting on

4972.8 --> 4976.719
i've never went there i wonder if

4975.12 --> 4978.5599999999995
there's anybody in the world that would

4976.719 --> 4981.04
ask such a question

4978.56 --> 4982.080000000001
but at least i've been convinced that

4981.04 --> 4985.12
they were

4982.08 --> 4987.84
because i had this idea in my head that

4985.12 --> 4987.84
you would ask

4988.56 --> 4993.360000000001
they'd say it's just on a turtle and

4991.84 --> 4995.12
that turtle's on a bigger turtle and

4993.36 --> 4996.5599999999995
that turtle's on another big turtle but

4995.12 --> 4998.96
maybe that was just a

4996.56 --> 5001.1990000000005
stupid rumor that jesuits placed there

4998.96 --> 5003.6
from the start i don't know i never

5001.199 --> 5015.839999999999
actually went there to ask people face

5003.6 --> 5015.84
to face

5023.36 --> 5027.679
or maybe that was a thing like 40 years

5025.92 --> 5030.32
ago

5027.679 --> 5032.159
and you weren't there i don't know from

5030.32 --> 5033.28
what i heard from you there's been a lot

5032.159 --> 5035.759999999999
of

5033.28 --> 5037.199
cultural development or decorating

5035.76 --> 5039.12
however you want to see it

5037.199 --> 5040.4
of indian culture in the last few

5039.12 --> 5044.4
decades

5040.4 --> 5047.199
so maybe they once used to say that

5044.4 --> 5048.5599999999995
and now they're just way beyond that i

5047.199 --> 5051.44
don't know

5048.56 --> 5057.84
i literally don't know i don't know how

5051.44 --> 5057.839999999999
to find out either

5064.639 --> 5067.92
before kobe did i get a chance to travel

5067.199 --> 5071.839999999999
much no

5067.92 --> 5071.84
i've never been much of a traveler

5085.28 --> 5089.36
all right should come to india at least

5087.44 --> 5090.638999999999
once yeah i would like to travel the

5089.36 --> 5094.4
entire world at least

5090.639 --> 5095.52
once but i extremely doubt that's ever

5094.4 --> 5098.159
gonna happen

5095.52 --> 5101.52
it's just an idea how much money would i

5098.159 --> 5101.5199999999995
have to waste on doing that

5101.84 --> 5108.32
money that i don't have with

5105.04 --> 5109.28
a giant company or empire whatever that

5108.32 --> 5113.84
i'm not building

5109.28 --> 5116.239
so how would i ever get there

5113.84 --> 5118.0
it's not really my priority to just go

5116.239 --> 5121.919999999999
to a place

5118.0 --> 5121.92
and spend a lot of money doing that

5122.56 --> 5126.8
i'd rather have a better place to live

5125.04 --> 5129.28
if you know what i mean

5126.8 --> 5130.08
where i can constantly do things with

5129.28 --> 5132.239
that place

5130.08 --> 5134.88
where i live like gardening and all that

5132.239 --> 5137.678999999999
and maybe goldsmithing again

5134.88 --> 5139.84
rather spend my money and effort on that

5137.679 --> 5142.08
attaining that then just going out and

5139.84 --> 5143.28
traveling wasting a huge amount of money

5142.08 --> 5155.84
doing that

5143.28 --> 5155.84
just to see places face to face

5155.92 --> 5160.32
that doesn't mean that i want to stay

5157.52 --> 5160.320000000001
here forever

5162.639 --> 5169.84
it's just not very high on my priority

5166.84 --> 5169.84
list

5182.639 --> 5186.400000000001
all right anyway i'll be back in two

5194.84 --> 5197.84
minutes

5278.84 --> 5281.84
ah

5292.84 --> 5295.84
hmm

5301.04 --> 5309.84
oh voynich what kind of a show

5311.36 --> 5323.839999999999
giving lectures on my insights oh god

5324.719 --> 5328.8
well maybe if there was some kind of

5326.32 --> 5331.28
like flat earth related

5328.8 --> 5331.92
conference or whatever somewhere then i

5331.28 --> 5336.159
might

5331.92 --> 5339.1990000000005
be part of that they even care

5336.159 --> 5340.638999999999
like i don't know man i get the feeling

5339.199 --> 5344.719
it's all just a club

5340.639 --> 5348.32
and i'm not really invited anymore

5344.719 --> 5352.32
because from what i'm seeing out there

5348.32 --> 5356.0
there's just a whole pile of people that

5352.32 --> 5358.32
just want to be the other nasa

5356.0 --> 5360.48
they just want to be another nasa in

5358.32 --> 5362.88
relation to nasa and kind of like

5360.48 --> 5365.199
replace it

5362.88 --> 5367.52
with a lot of [ __ ] and they're just

5365.199 --> 5369.759999999999
extremely competitive and peer pressure

5367.52 --> 5370.080000000001
based and they don't really want anybody

5369.76 --> 5372.400000000001
with

5370.08 --> 5375.44
complicated new ideas that just bring

5372.4 --> 5375.44
out more questions

5377.36 --> 5382.0
now actual people some of them out there

5380.8 --> 5384.159000000001
might be interested

5382.0 --> 5385.84
it's never going to be a wider audience

5384.159 --> 5388.159
i think i just

5385.84 --> 5390.32
maybe i'm wrong maybe at some point

5388.159 --> 5392.4
they'll be ready for it and they'll all

5390.32 --> 5394.239
pile up like oh could you please explain

5392.4 --> 5396.879999999999
this really complicated thing that

5394.239 --> 5399.839999999999
might actually turn out to be closer to

5396.88 --> 5403.12
reality than we ever thought possible

5399.84 --> 5405.28
yeah then i'll talk about it sure

5403.12 --> 5408.4
but we're not there everybody just

5405.28 --> 5411.12
thinks i'm a weirdo that just has really

5408.4 --> 5411.839999999999
to them out there or incomprehensible

5411.12 --> 5414.5599999999995
ideas

5411.84 --> 5417.1990000000005
it's just too difficult like what but

5414.56 --> 5418.080000000001
but you don't even think that stars and

5417.199 --> 5421.5199999999995
sun and moon

5418.08 --> 5422.8
are literal objects oh no i don't get it

5421.52 --> 5426.4800000000005
anymore

5422.8 --> 5429.4400000000005
yeah and i'm gonna do

5426.48 --> 5434.0
speeches about my concepts so who's

5429.44 --> 5436.5599999999995
actually gonna freaking understand that

5434.0 --> 5437.52
how many people do you in chat here know

5436.56 --> 5441.679
that actually

5437.52 --> 5441.679
understand what i'm talking about

5441.92 --> 5446.32
do you actually understand what i'm

5444.08 --> 5448.639
talking about when i'm doing that

5446.32 --> 5449.92
i think some of you do at least

5448.639 --> 5451.52
partially

5449.92 --> 5454.4
you understand the build up of the

5451.52 --> 5455.120000000001
arguments do you fully understand the

5454.4 --> 5457.44
scope

5455.12 --> 5460.239
of the surreal nature of reality as i'm

5457.44 --> 5460.239
figuring it out

5460.88 --> 5466.400000000001
i've done my best to put it down as

5464.639 --> 5469.52
clearly as possible

5466.4 --> 5471.92
but again it only brings out more

5469.52 --> 5473.6
questions it's what it does that's what

5471.92 --> 5475.76
actual inquiry

5473.6 --> 5477.84
into the nature of reality does it just

5475.76 --> 5479.92
brings out more questions

5477.84 --> 5482.8
and a lot of people don't like having

5479.92 --> 5482.8
more questions

5483.44 --> 5487.36
because the world's already complicated

5485.28 --> 5490.4
enough to deal with it

5487.36 --> 5491.12
as it is without all the other extra

5490.4 --> 5494.5599999999995
questions of

5491.12 --> 5496.48
what it actually is you know

5494.56 --> 5498.4800000000005
i think more people are just concerned

5496.48 --> 5501.759999999999
with how to deal with the world rather

5498.48 --> 5501.759999999999
than what it actually is

5502.84 --> 5505.84
uh

5515.74 --> 5519.478999999999
[Music]

5522.159 --> 5524.879999999999
hey samson

5530.48 --> 5534.638999999999
i know that a lot of you could probably

5535.52 --> 5546.400000000001
put down a even a halfway decent case

5539.6 --> 5549.6
to make similar arguments as that i have

5546.4 --> 5552.799999999999
and i know that if you can that's

5549.6 --> 5554.08
really amazing and it's it's more

5552.8 --> 5555.92
amazing than you probably

5554.08 --> 5559.76
realize because if you can't do that if

5555.92 --> 5561.679
you can actually fully follow what i say

5559.76 --> 5563.76
you you've overcome a lot of obstacles

5561.679 --> 5567.2390000000005
that don't seem like obstacles

5563.76 --> 5570.2390000000005
that to most people they are massive

5567.239 --> 5571.919999999999
impenetrable obstacles to them you have

5570.239 --> 5575.36
to realize that that even though it

5571.92 --> 5578.0
seems easy once you actually go past it

5575.36 --> 5578.96
or relatively easy up to a certain

5578.0 --> 5580.56
degree

5578.96 --> 5583.36
for a lot of other people it's just

5580.56 --> 5586.639
completely unattainable

5583.36 --> 5589.759999999999
you gotta realize that too and

5586.639 --> 5590.56
you already have a lower tier example of

5589.76 --> 5593.679
this

5590.56 --> 5594.4800000000005
in general with just globals globals

5593.679 --> 5597.92
versus

5594.48 --> 5597.919999999999
the flat nature of the realm

5598.08 --> 5601.92
so there it's already happening these

5600.639 --> 5603.12
things are already completely

5601.92 --> 5607.76
unattainable so

5603.12 --> 5607.76
yeah just imagine that

5607.84 --> 5611.360000000001
with the cosmogeny that i bring up and

5610.0 --> 5614.48
the potential

5611.36 --> 5615.44
possibilities of a roping realm and all

5614.48 --> 5616.959999999999
that

5615.44 --> 5619.28
that there's just even a whole bunch of

5616.96 --> 5619.679
flat earthers that can't really grasp

5619.28 --> 5622.159
that

5619.679 --> 5623.92
they can't get themselves to take it

5622.159 --> 5624.96
seriously they just think it's too

5623.92 --> 5629.28
ridiculous

5624.96 --> 5630.0
like what like special non-linearity

5629.28 --> 5633.92
that sounds so

5630.0 --> 5636.719
stupid and science fictiony yeah i know

5633.92 --> 5637.1990000000005
but it might still be true though and it

5636.719 --> 5641.76
is

5637.199 --> 5641.759999999999
falsifiable whether it is true or not

5642.84 --> 5648.2390000000005
so

5645.12 --> 5651.5199999999995
there's a lot more viable

5648.239 --> 5653.44
potential for

5651.52 --> 5655.92
figuring out the looping nature of the

5653.44 --> 5659.12
realm whether it is there or not

5655.92 --> 5661.04
than there is to ever attain the cause

5659.12 --> 5665.28
of relative density

5661.04 --> 5667.5199999999995
this equilibrium displacement popularly

5665.28 --> 5669.36
named gravity even though it's not

5667.52 --> 5672.2390000000005
gravity

5669.36 --> 5674.32
and what gravity is officially is also

5672.239 --> 5676.959999999999
unattainable and outside of physical

5674.32 --> 5676.96
reality

5684.84 --> 5691.1990000000005
so

5687.36 --> 5694.239
yeah yeah i do really get picky don't i

5691.199 --> 5696.4
there at 306. i'm being very

5694.239 --> 5697.678999999999
annoying i'm being that teacher that

5696.4 --> 5699.759999999999
just

5697.679 --> 5701.92
smashes on your finger if you just did

5699.76 --> 5703.76
this slightly wrong i know it's really

5701.92 --> 5706.96
annoying

5703.76 --> 5709.360000000001
but i do it to train you i really do do

5706.96 --> 5709.36
it because

5709.84 --> 5717.92
when attaining really complex things

5714.0 --> 5720.96
surreal natures of reality

5717.92 --> 5721.52
your worst enemy is your own psyche your

5720.96 --> 5723.84
worst

5721.52 --> 5725.4400000000005
enemy is your own psyche because you are

5723.84 --> 5727.52
trying to understand something that's

5725.44 --> 5729.5199999999995
really complicated

5727.52 --> 5730.8
and makes other people feel

5729.52 --> 5734.4800000000005
uncomfortable

5730.8 --> 5735.92
and you too it does make you kind of

5734.48 --> 5738.0
feel uncomfortable

5735.92 --> 5739.28
you have to learn to bypass that it

5738.0 --> 5742.08
doesn't mean that other people are going

5739.28 --> 5746.159
to bypass it

5742.08 --> 5748.48
so yeah the only way to do it is to be

5746.159 --> 5749.92
really strict because you're basically

5748.48 --> 5752.159
opposing

5749.92 --> 5754.32
by even doing it you're opposing a whole

5752.159 --> 5755.5199999999995
bunch of people that are unwilling to do

5754.32 --> 5757.199
it

5755.52 --> 5760.639
and that's why i get so technically

5757.199 --> 5760.638999999999
strict with this stuff

5761.76 --> 5765.52
because by just entertaining it you're

5764.08 --> 5768.88
already

5765.52 --> 5772.080000000001
opposing a huge amount of people

5768.88 --> 5774.4800000000005
that are not willing to even try

5772.08 --> 5774.48
you see

5783.199 --> 5788.239
you had catholic nuns as teachers who

5785.92 --> 5791.679
smacked our hands with a ruler

5788.239 --> 5792.638999999999
painful yeah i'm not a big proponent of

5791.679 --> 5795.119
that but it is

5792.639 --> 5795.84
as a symbol like i would never do that

5795.119 --> 5800.799999999999
like my

5795.84 --> 5803.360000000001
hands god terrible

5800.8 --> 5805.52
because just imagine if there's people

5803.36 --> 5807.44
in there that play piano what kind of an

5805.52 --> 5810.2390000000005
action is that smacking their hands

5807.44 --> 5810.239
that's terrible

5810.88 --> 5814.4800000000005
now i'd be the one that would actually

5812.719 --> 5817.28
smack the ruler

5814.48 --> 5818.4
right in front of you on the table like

5817.28 --> 5820.5599999999995
bang

5818.4 --> 5822.48
to really startle you that would be my

5820.56 --> 5824.96
tactic i would never physically hurt

5822.48 --> 5827.678999999999
somebody

5824.96 --> 5828.719
like that i don't think it's really even

5827.679 --> 5831.119
allowed anymore

5828.719 --> 5834.32
this is it's not tolerated anymore in

5831.119 --> 5834.32
school systems anyway

5834.8 --> 5838.08
but i definitely startled the [ __ ] out

5837.28 --> 5841.84
of students that

5838.08 --> 5841.84
weren't paying proper attention

5853.119 --> 5859.28
yeah samson i know it's early for you

5856.48 --> 5859.28
don't worry about it

5865.04 --> 5869.199
satan is the accuser well no satan is

5868.32 --> 5872.639
the liar

5869.199 --> 5874.32
but liars always accuse to defend

5872.639 --> 5876.159000000001
themselves prevent them from being

5874.32 --> 5879.5199999999995
accused

5876.159 --> 5879.5199999999995
so you're right

5879.84 --> 5884.4800000000005
i just found a little room to improve

5883.04 --> 5888.48
upon it but i

5884.48 --> 5888.48
yeah but you are right samson

5888.56 --> 5894.56
it's just that liars always end up

5891.92 --> 5896.0
accusing others of lies to prevent

5894.56 --> 5898.400000000001
themselves from being accused

5896.0 --> 5900.719
of the lies that they know they are

5898.4 --> 5900.719
using

5902.56 --> 5911.6
it's a standard tactic it's like even

5905.92 --> 5914.159
political standard now

5911.6 --> 5916.400000000001
but in the fundamental core of it in the

5914.159 --> 5920.0
essence the esoterics of it

5916.4 --> 5922.08
satan is lies it is literally the

5920.0 --> 5926.56
essence of lies itself

5922.08 --> 5926.5599999999995
what it does what lies make you do

5932.0 --> 5935.76
that those words are in the bible though

5934.56 --> 5938.96
right

5935.76 --> 5941.679
but i just said

5938.96 --> 5943.679
he is the accuser i'm just giving a

5941.679 --> 5946.0
little bit of esoteric reason as to

5943.679 --> 5946.0
why

5946.32 --> 5950.5599999999995
[Music]

5948.239 --> 5953.839999999999
because liars always end up accusing

5950.56 --> 5953.84
others of lies

5962.0 --> 5966.239
satan wishes he was opposite of the

5964.159 --> 5970.0
creator no

5966.239 --> 5973.44
satan just wants to be separate

5970.0 --> 5976.48
satan the lie the essence of lies

5973.44 --> 5981.04
wants the lies to be real

5976.48 --> 5984.48
and thereby opposing the truth

5981.04 --> 5987.679
god see esoteric approach

5984.48 --> 5990.0
and it is true it's not opposite it

5987.679 --> 5995.84
is the opposite of the creator it is the

5990.0 --> 5995.84
opposite of truth

5996.159 --> 6005.679
but lights want the lies to be real

6000.719 --> 6005.679
and not to let go of it of the lies

6007.52 --> 6010.719
so in that sense it doesn't want to be

6009.84 --> 6013.04
opposite

6010.719 --> 6015.6
it is the opposite no it wants to

6013.04 --> 6015.6
replace

6015.76 --> 6020.639
to make the lie into the the accepted

6020.84 --> 6023.84
truth

6033.76 --> 6039.6
as above so below satanic statement i i

6036.56 --> 6039.6
would not go there

6041.679 --> 6044.719
i don't think it's just it's just the

6044.159 --> 6048.48
truth

6044.719 --> 6053.28
it's just esoteric truth it's alchemy

6048.48 --> 6056.4
you might put it together with alchemy

6053.28 --> 6058.4
so above so blow as above so below it's

6056.4 --> 6062.5599999999995
not satanic

6058.4 --> 6063.759999999999
like yeah maybe satanists have adopted

6062.56 --> 6066.88
it

6063.76 --> 6070.320000000001
satanists adopt everything they always

6066.88 --> 6071.6
just take things make it their own twist

6070.32 --> 6075.04
its original

6071.6 --> 6076.08
or its original nature and then make

6075.04 --> 6080.08
everybody believe

6076.08 --> 6083.28
that henceforth that thing is satanic

6080.08 --> 6086.0
satanists claim things

6083.28 --> 6086.96
and then destroy the original essence of

6086.0 --> 6092.239
it

6086.96 --> 6095.679
that's what they really do

6092.239 --> 6095.678999999999
right it's kind of like how the

6095.92 --> 6099.92
it's a rough comparison it's like

6102.08 --> 6106.639
is it the the i don't even know what the

6105.44 --> 6110.0
right name for it is the

6106.639 --> 6114.08
the swastika how it is now

6110.0 --> 6116.4
considered as a absolutely evil symbol

6114.08 --> 6118.08
because of the association with hitler

6116.4 --> 6119.5199999999995
and of course that's been heavily

6118.08 --> 6121.76
reinforced by history and even

6119.52 --> 6124.8
propagandize

6121.76 --> 6126.2390000000005
but that's not what it meant it never

6124.8 --> 6128.400000000001
meant that it was always

6126.239 --> 6128.4
a

6129.36 --> 6137.5199999999995
something different something good

6133.76 --> 6138.0
and then they made it into evil and then

6137.52 --> 6140.96
people

6138.0 --> 6142.719
remember the evil and the evil is echoed

6140.96 --> 6144.159
and when somebody brings a forth the

6142.719 --> 6148.159
symbol say no no we

6144.159 --> 6150.5599999999995
this is not the nazi cross

6148.159 --> 6153.119
then a lot of people will still look at

6150.56 --> 6156.320000000001
it in fear and still associate it

6153.119 --> 6160.0
that's what satanism does satanism

6156.32 --> 6160.799999999999
steals real things energy things

6160.0 --> 6164.8
esoteric

6160.8 --> 6168.2390000000005
truths symbols great things and then

6164.8 --> 6172.56
makes it into a twisted

6168.239 --> 6175.119
version of its original self and then

6172.56 --> 6176.56
throw that out there so people will

6175.119 --> 6180.0
associate it

6176.56 --> 6183.92
with evil evil

6180.0 --> 6185.92
destroys good powers

6183.92 --> 6187.679
by making everybody believe that

6185.92 --> 6190.639
everything is evil

6187.679 --> 6194.4800000000005
by assimilating everything into it

6190.639 --> 6194.4800000000005
that's the real satanic evil

6194.719 --> 6198.56
and i'm actually longing for the ability

6198.159 --> 6202.159
to

6198.56 --> 6206.639
reclaim the symbols and basically

6202.159 --> 6206.638999999999
undo the satanic power

6208.48 --> 6214.32
i even kind of attempted this myself in

6211.36 --> 6218.159
my goldsmithing days

6214.32 --> 6222.48
in a way this this thing that i

6218.159 --> 6226.32
designed that i made

6222.48 --> 6228.5599999999995
10 star is two pentagrams it was an

6226.32 --> 6229.36
attempt this is an attempt to basically

6228.56 --> 6231.119000000001
say okay

6229.36 --> 6232.799999999999
pentagrams it's very specifically

6231.119 --> 6234.96
associated with

6232.8 --> 6236.159000000001
things and like even the upside down

6234.96 --> 6239.36
pentagram it's like oh

6236.159 --> 6240.4
that's the satanic pentagram right well

6239.36 --> 6244.799999999999
i'm

6240.4 --> 6248.96
undoing it i'm trying to say no

6244.8 --> 6250.96
two pentagrams in conjunction

6248.96 --> 6252.4800000000005
make something else it's still two

6250.96 --> 6256.08
pentagrams but now

6252.48 --> 6259.44
it's in balance it's the sun it's ten

6256.08 --> 6262.48
it's the one and the zero it is

6259.44 --> 6265.04
the duality female male

6262.48 --> 6266.879999999999
it is the sun it is a symbol of light it

6265.04 --> 6269.199
is

6266.88 --> 6271.28
the natural balance conjunction it is

6269.199 --> 6274.799999999999
all kinds of things

6271.28 --> 6275.44
it's not just a stupid oh i am opposing

6274.8 --> 6278.08
to god

6275.44 --> 6279.04
pentagram cause i hate that they did

6278.08 --> 6281.76
that

6279.04 --> 6281.76
i hate it

6283.679 --> 6291.119
evil assimilates symbols

6287.6 --> 6293.52
and then ruins it for everything else

6291.119 --> 6294.32
and i heavily oppose that so every time

6293.52 --> 6297.1990000000005
somebody

6294.32 --> 6298.0
even in goodwill says oh this thing is

6297.199 --> 6300.0
satanic

6298.0 --> 6302.639
i'm immediately having an allergic

6300.0 --> 6306.0
response saying no

6302.639 --> 6308.4800000000005
technically nothing is satanic

6306.0 --> 6310.0
the only thing that's satanic is the

6308.48 --> 6313.5199999999995
satanic spirit

6310.0 --> 6313.52
that makes it satanic

6314.96 --> 6318.8
it is the will to corrupt everything and

6317.6 --> 6321.6
then

6318.8 --> 6324.159000000001
make everybody believe that the

6321.6 --> 6327.360000000001
corrupted version is the only version

6324.159 --> 6331.839999999999
that's the real satanism and people do

6327.36 --> 6331.839999999999
it by accident all the time

6333.119 --> 6336.239
as above so below but as buff so below

6335.76 --> 6339.52
is an

6336.239 --> 6340.32
esoteric truth it is about the design

6339.52 --> 6344.159000000001
mechanism

6340.32 --> 6347.04
of all things and just because

6344.159 --> 6349.199
satanists know that and apply it does

6347.04 --> 6349.76
not make that knowledge evil it just

6349.199 --> 6353.839999999999
makes it

6349.76 --> 6353.84
a truth that is being abused

6354.719 --> 6358.8
sorry for making such an elaborate case

6356.8 --> 6361.1990000000005
about that but i really felt the need to

6358.8 --> 6361.1990000000005
do that

6362.8 --> 6367.76
like i see like a certain group

6365.04 --> 6372.97
seemingly stole a rainbow exactly jay

6367.76 --> 6376.089
you get it

6372.97 --> 6376.089
[Music]

6378.39 --> 6387.84
[Music]

6384.84 --> 6387.84
uh

6388.32 --> 6392.08
ah i well i'm very glad to hear that

6390.8 --> 6394.320000000001
samson i'm

6392.08 --> 6396.32
yeah it was absolutely not meant as an

6394.32 --> 6397.119
attack because it's an honest mistake to

6396.32 --> 6400.159
make it's a

6397.119 --> 6401.28
it's a habit that is echoed out there a

6400.159 --> 6403.839999999999
lot

6401.28 --> 6406.48
because people are looking for an enemy

6403.84 --> 6409.84
to attack and so they identify it

6406.48 --> 6413.28
but they forget that these things

6409.84 --> 6417.360000000001
identified with the evil

6413.28 --> 6417.36
are assimilated things

6417.76 --> 6424.88
they were not evil from the get-go

6422.48 --> 6426.0
and they shouldn't be assumed to be evil

6424.88 --> 6429.84
just because evil

6426.0 --> 6429.84
is big and has assimilated everything

6442.719 --> 6458.159
your keyboard is not seeming to

6444.56 --> 6458.159000000001
cooperate a lot george sanford yeah

6458.56 --> 6464.320000000001
yeah dutch sailor indeed and i like this

6462.239 --> 6466.959999999999
because owen benjamin also brought

6464.32 --> 6467.759999999999
up this concept several times in his

6466.96 --> 6470.88
shows and i

6467.76 --> 6474.4800000000005
heavily echo that sentiment

6470.88 --> 6477.92
don't really know what to do about it

6474.48 --> 6480.638999999999
because how can you undo the swastika at

6477.92 --> 6483.28
this point how can you undo that

6480.639 --> 6484.08
it'll take several generations of not

6483.28 --> 6487.28
conditioning

6484.08 --> 6488.5599999999995
people that every symbol associated with

6487.28 --> 6491.679
hitler originally

6488.56 --> 6495.76
is always by default evil

6491.679 --> 6499.84
it's very hard to get rid of it you know

6495.76 --> 6504.159000000001
like evil conditioning is very tenacious

6499.84 --> 6506.4800000000005
delusion is very hard to get rid of

6504.159 --> 6508.879999999999
you can believe you can be fooled in a

6506.48 --> 6513.839999999999
second and it'll take a lifetime to get

6508.88 --> 6513.84
rid of it

6519.28 --> 6527.84
potentially not always

6535.76 --> 6544.0
this spiral symbol what

6540.639 --> 6546.88
i have no idea about that but that's

6544.0 --> 6547.52
really [ __ ] up there at 306 nothing

6546.88 --> 6550.56
should be

6547.52 --> 6550.56
associated with that

6551.76 --> 6557.119000000001
the only severed heads should be

6554.08 --> 6557.119
associated with that

6558.96 --> 6562.8
if they're gonna freaking assimilate

6560.639 --> 6565.52
that [ __ ]

6562.8 --> 6566.84
oh sam tripoli said it well sam tripoli

6565.52 --> 6569.84
is

6566.84 --> 6569.84
ugh

6575.04 --> 6578.639
at least i think the last time i saw

6577.679 --> 6581.92
something oven

6578.639 --> 6583.92
i don't really follow him at all every

6581.92 --> 6586.88
time somebody says that oh

6583.92 --> 6589.4400000000005
look they now have a new symbol for

6586.88 --> 6592.400000000001
something that is really sick and evil

6589.44 --> 6595.28
oh you might want to look into where

6592.4 --> 6597.5199999999995
they assimilated it from

6595.28 --> 6598.88
is it just an overt steel of something

6597.52 --> 6601.52
that it pre-existed

6598.88 --> 6605.28
or did they just combine some [ __ ] and

6601.52 --> 6605.280000000001
make it into their evil symbol

6605.92 --> 6608.4800000000005
i don't know

6609.04 --> 6615.5199999999995
but to just claim a spiral

6612.96 --> 6618.08
that's just idiotic and extremely

6615.52 --> 6618.080000000001
arrogant

6620.08 --> 6627.199
spirals are pretty ancient things

6623.679 --> 6630.96
like spirals in in the

6627.199 --> 6633.839999999999
celtic symbology or even seen as

6630.96 --> 6633.84
ghost traps

6634.32 --> 6638.0
so like because your mind would be

6636.4 --> 6641.199
tricked into spiraling

6638.0 --> 6643.199
into it so what is a dark spirits could

6641.199 --> 6644.48
be tricked could be trapped into it as

6643.199 --> 6646.239
well that's

6644.48 --> 6648.08
if i remember correctly it's kind of

6646.239 --> 6653.839999999999
vague my memory about it

6648.08 --> 6653.84
that's how spirals were seen

6664.719 --> 6667.84
right invert symbols to make us fear

6666.88 --> 6670.88
them

6667.84 --> 6673.360000000001
well i'm i'm basically

6670.88 --> 6677.119
negating that i'm dispelling that by

6673.36 --> 6679.839999999999
just applying my own symbols

6677.119 --> 6681.199
and designing them and really having

6679.84 --> 6685.52
deep thought to them

6681.199 --> 6689.36
as i do with my ring

6685.52 --> 6691.360000000001
like there's a whole bunch of text

6689.36 --> 6695.839999999999
that is directly associated with that

6691.36 --> 6695.839999999999
symbol and i designed it for that

6703.54 --> 6706.71
[Music]

6706.84 --> 6709.84
specifically

6721.52 --> 6728.2390000000005
hmm yeah here we go a freemasonry is

6725.119 --> 6728.239
riddled with that [ __ ]

6730.159 --> 6734.159
it's always been kind of like the occult

6732.08 --> 6737.84
symbolic playing room and there's all

6734.159 --> 6737.839999999999
kinds of screwing around

6745.84 --> 6751.84
flower of life well that's this one

6757.92 --> 6762.84
do i think i'll ever get back into

6759.679 --> 6765.84
goldsmithing again i would like to

6762.84 --> 6765.84
definitely

6765.92 --> 6769.04
but yeah i can't do that as long as i

6767.679 --> 6771.04
live here because

6769.04 --> 6772.32
you can't do goldsmithing in the same

6771.04 --> 6774.88
room you're sleeping that's

6772.32 --> 6776.239
extremely unwise because there's just

6774.88 --> 6779.36
all kinds of

6776.239 --> 6782.48
chemical [ __ ] and like heating

6779.36 --> 6792.639
metal vapors that you don't want in the

6782.48 --> 6794.718999999999
same room you're sleeping so i chose

6792.639 --> 6797.28
specifically not to do that like no

6794.719 --> 6799.679
it's not oh i'm gonna risk everything if

6797.28 --> 6801.84
just because i want to do certain things

6799.679 --> 6801.84
no

6802.32 --> 6806.32
i have yeah prioritized keeping myself

6805.52 --> 6809.52
clean

6806.32 --> 6811.599
healthy as much as i can

6809.52 --> 6814.56
and besides when i kind of rounded out

6811.599 --> 6814.56
my goldsmithing

6815.199 --> 6822.32
a lot of the energy and inspiration kind

6818.719 --> 6822.32
of had kind of settled anyway

6822.56 --> 6825.1990000000005
kind of stop

6828.0 --> 6835.84
what is crop circles i don't know man i

6830.8 --> 6835.84
don't know

6851.119 --> 6856.08
what percentage of gold what what i

6853.92 --> 6857.679
don't typically make old things i mostly

6856.08 --> 6860.88
made silver things

6857.679 --> 6865.76
just sterling silver

6860.88 --> 6869.76
but yeah this ring is 14 karat

6865.76 --> 6873.04
so that's what is it uh eight

6869.76 --> 6877.84
eighty two and a half percent if i

6873.04 --> 6877.84
remember correctly

6899.28 --> 6905.84
it's interesting like this ring is now

6901.599 --> 6905.84
almost 15 years old

6906.32 --> 6912.239
and oh yeah this is actually the first

6909.44 --> 6913.199
golden ring first golden object i ever

6912.239 --> 6916.0
made

6913.199 --> 6917.678999999999
because i dropped out of school

6916.0 --> 6919.52
goldsmithing school before that time

6917.679 --> 6921.119
because they were literally just trying

6919.52 --> 6925.1990000000005
to force me to

6921.119 --> 6928.5599999999995
waste as much material gold material as

6925.199 --> 6931.839999999999
as they could figure out

6928.56 --> 6934.639
yeah because i had to buy it so they

6931.84 --> 6937.599
were literally just trying to extort me

6934.639 --> 6940.2390000000005
to ruin my own jewelry concept just so

6937.599 --> 6941.76
that i would spend more money on them

6940.239 --> 6943.36
and that's the time that i dropped out

6941.76 --> 6946.639
of the school said yeah you can all go

6943.36 --> 6949.759999999999
[ __ ] yourself you've

6946.639 --> 6953.04
filthy scumbags liars

6949.76 --> 6955.4400000000005
manipulators and scam artists like

6953.04 --> 6956.08
i really did not like what they did they

6955.44 --> 6958.638999999999
were just

6956.08 --> 6960.239
there was just the giant financial scam

6958.639 --> 6963.92
artistry going on i

6960.239 --> 6967.919999999999
can i i am saying that

6963.92 --> 6967.92
it was raked i didn't like it

6968.88 --> 6972.400000000001
didn't like that school at all there

6970.719 --> 6973.679
were a couple of really good teachers

6972.4 --> 6978.239
and there were just some

6973.679 --> 6981.679
really nasty nasty globalist

6978.239 --> 6985.199
[ __ ] scumbags there that made my life

6981.679 --> 6988.4800000000005
miserable it really did

6985.199 --> 6991.119
on purpose like exploited my

6988.48 --> 6992.638999999999
emotional vulnerability at times like

6991.119 --> 6995.759999999999
that far

6992.639 --> 6996.159000000001
total scumbags so i dropped out of it

6995.76 --> 6998.719
because

6996.159 --> 7000.719
yeah you don't need a piece of paper

6998.719 --> 7003.119
from goldsmithing schools

7000.719 --> 7005.52
to get going as a professional so i just

7003.119 --> 7006.4
saw the screw that i'll just make my own

7005.52 --> 7009.4400000000005
things then

7006.4 --> 7012.5599999999995
and i did that fortunately

7009.44 --> 7014.719
i was never very commercial minded i

7012.56 --> 7018.4800000000005
just wanted to make stuff

7014.719 --> 7019.28
just make it just be inspired and make

7018.48 --> 7021.839999999999
something and

7019.28 --> 7024.48
i'd never really care too much for

7021.84 --> 7024.4800000000005
profit or

7028.84 --> 7032.32
so

7030.4 --> 7033.92
getting a job at a smaller independent

7032.32 --> 7036.96
jeweler yeah

7033.92 --> 7039.119
well i have insane amounts of

7036.96 --> 7040.8
competition with that that's been a big

7039.119 --> 7043.44
problem because there is

7040.8 --> 7045.599
like the netherlands is just saturated

7043.44 --> 7051.04
with goldsmiths there's too many of them

7045.599 --> 7054.2390000000005
and most people they just take family

7051.04 --> 7057.44
they just hire their own family because

7054.239 --> 7059.199
it's tough to find any family out here

7057.44 --> 7061.36
in the netherlands by now that does not

7059.199 --> 7063.759999999999
have a goldsmith in it somewhere

7061.36 --> 7063.759999999999
really

7065.04 --> 7069.679
so it was never really to me a viable

7067.92 --> 7071.1990000000005
profession because the only way it can

7069.679 --> 7073.36
be is if you literally

7071.199 --> 7074.96
never have a vacation ever again and

7073.36 --> 7077.44
just spend all your time

7074.96 --> 7079.76
just trying to get around from it and

7077.44 --> 7082.4
i've seen some other people do it

7079.76 --> 7083.84
even successfully it's just not the type

7082.4 --> 7086.799999999999
of life that i wanted

7083.84 --> 7088.4800000000005
i purely wanted it because of the craft

7086.8 --> 7091.76
because i wanted to

7088.48 --> 7093.04
make things so i kind of take took it

7091.76 --> 7095.84
more as a hobby

7093.04 --> 7096.96
than i did as an actual profession

7095.84 --> 7097.92
because i've never been that

7096.96 --> 7100.96
professional

7097.92 --> 7104.2390000000005
i'm just really

7100.96 --> 7106.56
enthusiastic about the craft itself

7104.239 --> 7109.04
or rather the design part of the craft

7106.56 --> 7109.04
mostly

7110.08 --> 7115.84
right ah it's already three o'clock how

7112.719 --> 7115.84
time has flown

7119.36 --> 7129.839999999999
