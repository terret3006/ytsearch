10.28 --> 14.219
okay guys

11.849 --> 20.91
yeah internet problems here I'm trying

14.219 --> 23.93
to start up again there may be some

20.91 --> 23.93
problems with this

36.899 --> 45.6
all right hello Patricia Dockery it's

41.68 --> 48.91
not in the same video is it alright okay

45.6 --> 51.510000000000005
guys I got in my internet got

48.91 --> 54.76
disconnected and then for some reason

51.51 --> 56.26
OBS still continued streaming but it

54.76 --> 60.07
didn't start anything up so it was

56.26 --> 62.409
literally dead streaming great so I

60.07 --> 65.729
stopped the stream and then started it

62.409 --> 70.899
up again but it's not in the same window

65.729 --> 73.509
so I guess this is going to be flattered

70.899 --> 85.259
early-bird 509 B and it's gonna be about

73.509 --> 88.869
15 minutes max ridiculous okay how do I

85.259 --> 92.31
get back on a normal main page I have to

88.869 --> 92.31
reconnect Chet also

104.479 --> 109.759
okay this is gonna be an odd question

106.729 --> 113.11
but could somebody in chat put the link

109.759 --> 115.28
to the YouTube stream in my chats

113.11 --> 121.63
because I can't find it

115.28 --> 121.63
yeah you know sounds kind of weird right

125.56 --> 130.479
okay chats in place now

136.14 --> 144.2
no right right thank you thank you

139.02 --> 144.20000000000002
that's good enough okay

145.7 --> 150.67999999999998
all right

147.54 --> 150.67999999999998
and I'm back

154.76 --> 162.23999999999998
okay uh uh no it's okay I already that

159.24 --> 165.72
I'm already there okay please with the

162.24 --> 167.91
other video still Rogen's that one up

165.72 --> 170.16
don't forget I thought it was pretty

167.91 --> 172.17
damn good I'm actually kind of pissed

170.16 --> 175.88
off that it this happened because I

172.17 --> 180.14999999999998
thought that was probably one of my best

175.88 --> 182.49
streams to date up until the point where

180.15 --> 186.18
it broke but I guess that's very typical

182.49 --> 194.88
these days when you're really crushing

186.18 --> 198.99
it as they say or as Owen says anyway

194.88 --> 206.1
thanks guys up ten more minutes so yeah

198.99 --> 212.52
I guess move on and any thing you guys

206.1 --> 218.45999999999998
want to talk about a creation bear is

212.52 --> 222.26000000000002
that Goku or is that Gohan that Super

218.46 --> 222.26000000000002
Saiyan go on you got there so I can

225.95 --> 234.31
[Music]

227.5 --> 239.97
oh it's alex jones alright wow you

234.31 --> 239.97
change your name okay

242.64 --> 252.29999999999998
right nice nice name by the way

246.77 --> 256.17
the creation bears a good name this era

252.3 --> 258.48
of Gohan can't be touched so calm okay

256.17 --> 260.64000000000004
I don't know exactly what that means but

258.48 --> 270.51
I was referring to the character of the

260.64 --> 282.89
Dragon Ball Z series got creation beerus

270.51 --> 282.89
an awesome guy so far you know what

283.16 --> 292.56
actually good enough for a rinche

285.51 --> 294.65999999999997
I like giving bears wrenches anyway but

292.56 --> 296.94
only if they're actually real and you

294.66 --> 303.63000000000005
can't fake you can't fake that [ __ ] so

296.94 --> 308.96
Oh Gary sheller we could do it tomorrow

303.63 --> 312.69
if I'm up for it because do to be fair

308.96 --> 315.93
I'm not really too enthusiastic about

312.69 --> 320.63
this project of yours it's like really

315.93 --> 324.229
you want to psychologically analyze the

320.63 --> 327.69
views of flat-earthers on the other

324.229 --> 329.88
flat-earthers it's like oh really and

327.69 --> 333.03
it's just gonna go to some american

329.88 --> 335.4
statistics agency like oh well there's

333.03 --> 338.84999999999997
nothing that could go wrong with that in

335.4 --> 342.419
any way right it's totally not viable

338.85 --> 345.21000000000004
for some kind of weird abuse cuz

342.419 --> 347.669
everything like data you just hand over

345.21 --> 353.60999999999996
to the government nothing have bad ever

347.669 --> 357.08
happens with that right so on the other

353.61 --> 361.83000000000004
hand yeah it's always I'm always easily

357.08 --> 364.40999999999997
put to work to basically analyze people

361.83 --> 366.09
so yeah you did kind of come to the

364.41 --> 369.77000000000004
right place concerning that kind of

366.09 --> 369.77
thing but yeah you know

395.409 --> 398.129
all right

398.36 --> 404.349
but yeah in general look if you want to

401.449 --> 407.0
genuinely know or want to understand

404.349 --> 408.77
what the intelligence and the talent

407.0 --> 412.849
range of flat-earthers are like well

408.77 --> 416.53
they are literally as as far and broad

412.849 --> 423.93899999999996
as you can be we got some of the most

416.53 --> 427.099
desperate [ __ ] idiots that that just

423.939 --> 429.68
are like curiosities on themselves

427.099 --> 432.5
we have those nobody really likes them

429.68 --> 436.31
or they're like an adorned to them so

432.5 --> 439.43
that kind of thing I don't know of a

436.31 --> 443.44
thing like that with Dell but and then

439.43 --> 447.379
there is just the most insanely talented

443.44 --> 450.19
wise people you could ever imagine and

447.379 --> 452.99
most of you can probably even see how

450.19 --> 456.52
incredible they are among them as well

452.99 --> 459.86
it's literally all over the place and

456.52 --> 462.919
there's not like a huge chunk of middle

459.86 --> 466.099
ground at it it's really pretty

462.919 --> 470.09
genuinely spread out all over the

466.099 --> 473.479
spectrum unlike the general public which

470.09 --> 474.44
are very blatantly huge chunk in between

473.479 --> 479.18
all that because they've been

474.44 --> 483.139
conditioned to go there so that kind of

479.18 --> 485.319
already sums up the entire research for

483.139 --> 485.319
yeah

494.08 --> 497.08
yeah

501.719 --> 504.529
right

504.96 --> 511.13899999999995
and and besides yeah even we got

508.62 --> 513.899
extremely moral flat-earthers or that

511.139 --> 516.51
are like desperately trying to find

513.899 --> 519.45
moral morality to the best of their

516.51 --> 521.909
ability or fine-tune it in some way

519.45 --> 524.49
there are many different moral searchers

521.909 --> 529.56
in Flat Earth as well but there's also

524.49 --> 532.14
just blatant creeps among them as well

529.56 --> 537.26
or people that just have blatant creep

532.14 --> 540.209
elements to them from sociopaths II -

537.26 --> 544.17
what is it again - just blatant

540.209 --> 546.4799999999999
narcissism up until and you don't

544.17 --> 548.13
probably you wouldn't know it you

546.48 --> 550.38
wouldn't really see it there will be

548.13 --> 557.029
more background people up - pretty

550.38 --> 560.85
creepy [ __ ] you know so

557.029 --> 563.33
everything is in there I think that the

560.85 --> 566.85
Flat Earth community is probably yeah a

563.33 --> 570.87
good representation of like what humans

566.85 --> 575.73
can be like in all directions good and

570.87 --> 586.02
bad [ __ ] and brilliant foolish and

575.73 --> 588.51
wise although I'd like to say that most

586.02 --> 593.52
letters are probably on average more

588.51 --> 596.67
moral some morally sound then then yeah

593.52 --> 600.779
disgusting but yeah I don't know anymore

596.67 --> 605.61
these days people do get dragged into

600.779 --> 608.88
bad behavior very easily it seems it's

605.61 --> 613.0500000000001
the new normal demonic is the new normal

608.88 --> 615.27
for many people unfortunately and the

613.05 --> 618.66
biggest unfortune that comes with that

615.27 --> 620.8199999999999
is that other people stop telling them

618.66 --> 626.1
to stop that's the biggest problem

620.82 --> 628.8900000000001
really they're like oh yeah everybody

626.1 --> 631.589
knows that everybody behaves like a

628.89 --> 633.14
complete miserable disgusting demon

631.589 --> 636.5100000000001
every now and then it's normal

633.14 --> 637.6899999999999
well just let it happen don't say

636.51 --> 641.62
anything about it

637.69 --> 645.34
that's gonna help right no it's just

641.62 --> 649.33
gonna make it a lot worse hmm anyway I

645.34 --> 652.63

649.33 --> 654.9100000000001
