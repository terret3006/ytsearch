151.15 --> 155.19
composition from yeah for yesterday

156.06 --> 161.079
it slowly getting a bit warmer you say

158.68 --> 162.76000000000002
Steve I don't know what this weather is

161.079 --> 167.41
it's just I don't know this is just

162.76 --> 170.41
typical Dutch weather at this point it

167.41 --> 175.079
seems kind of random ie unbelievable

170.41 --> 175.079
productions to see you

179.49 --> 191.69
all right so went bed pretty early did I

188.76 --> 191.69
do again

193.89 --> 198.55999999999997
there's plenty of things I watched RIA

196.14 --> 203.27999999999997
on Benjamin I definitely remember that

198.56 --> 205.71
that was hilarious and like the

203.28 --> 210.27
synchronicity just went off the charts

205.71 --> 214.58
I don't know if anybody seen like the

210.27 --> 220.11
like when apparently somebody sent him

214.58 --> 223.08
like hey a Kings outfit knitted armor

220.11 --> 227.36
and a crown it was just amazing while he

223.08 --> 230.46
was right in the middle of showing this

227.36 --> 240.18
mountain bear video from the Lord of the

230.46 --> 251.34
Rings scene it's just yeah I'm still

240.18 --> 256.58
kind of baffled about that best

251.34 --> 256.58
apocalypse ever okay Rosie Lee

260.04 --> 271.02000000000004
oh yeah I remember now yeah I continued

267.12 --> 273.6
watching some series and got through the

271.02 --> 275.25
Good Witch like entirely was it just

273.6 --> 279.81
kind of ended that's probably going to

275.25 --> 284.97
be more but it was interesting to watch

279.81 --> 286.74
for that series like also trying to see

284.97 --> 291.83000000000004
us to like what are they doing what's

286.74 --> 299.39
happening in there right

291.83 --> 299.39
Owen is king bear now is the bear King

299.69 --> 309.24
King off the bass yeah anybody that

307.29 --> 314.19
hasn't seen that it's really missed out

309.24 --> 321.11
on something it was just it was amazing

314.19 --> 321.11
oh hey that's how it ended

325.389 --> 334.06
right by the way a little rumor [ __ ] I

329.77 --> 336.18899999999996
remember that that crazy yelling next to

334.06 --> 340.5
me the fight that definitely seemed like

336.189 --> 343.689
a breakup well apparently it was just

340.5 --> 346.0
baby level crying because they

343.689 --> 350.62
apparently just made up or something

346.0 --> 352.719
I think it's she tried to like take

350.62 --> 355.18
control of his mind or something and he

352.719 --> 357.43
just refused it's like no I'm gonna do

355.18 --> 358.93
what I want and then she just went full

357.43 --> 360.759
nuts I think something like that

358.93 --> 365.469
happened because yeah they were still

360.759 --> 367.93
here saw them going out together it is

365.469 --> 379.09
today or that they're probably not as

367.93 --> 386.169
they used to be that's freaky hey dank

379.09 --> 393.81899999999996
oh thank you good serving for the dollar

386.169 --> 401.31899999999996
to send superjet donation is there soap

393.819 --> 404.37
opera oh it is really look in retrospect

401.319 --> 408.159
it really seemed just like baby crying

404.37 --> 411.009
just making pure drama and as Extreme as

408.159 --> 412.96
possible just like little kids can do

411.009 --> 414.96000000000004
that sometimes to their mothers or

412.96 --> 418.62899999999996
something you know it's it's really

414.96 --> 421.779
aggravating it's like too much it's like

418.629 --> 428.12
way over the top and of course the

421.779 --> 433.419
person involved will feel that all right

428.12 --> 433.419
oh yeah I think she's kind of annoying

435.79 --> 441.58000000000004
Alex holler come hello

450.26 --> 452.95
right

468.68 --> 479.57
but yeah in general I'm kind of I don't

477.259 --> 482.3
know what it is it's you know I'm I'm

479.57 --> 485.539
generally used to like just going around

482.3 --> 487.82
media sampling things you know I sample

485.539 --> 490.37
even the Dutch television every now and

487.82 --> 492.68
then and others

490.37 --> 495.05
yeah sites even like RT I don't go there

492.68 --> 498.5
that much anymore but still sometimes a

495.05 --> 501.5
good place just to test the waters all

498.5 --> 505.55
over it but it's just that everything's

501.5 --> 506.62
gone just completely apeshit everywhere

505.55 --> 509.96000000000004
[Music]

506.62 --> 513.4590000000001
so it's like kind of pressing on me and

509.96 --> 515.9
it's depressing me in a way but it's

513.459 --> 519.169
because I just feel like everything so

515.9 --> 521.39
draining now I don't know if I'm the

519.169 --> 524.87
only one that's like really feeling that

521.39 --> 529.54
I know we're all in sensing it you know

524.87 --> 529.54
but for me it's like really tiresome now

530.56 --> 539.209
and just everything is going nuts and

535.51 --> 541.459
you know like in respond something I

539.209 --> 543.56
typically used to do is just read news

541.459 --> 546.1999999999999
art I did that like 10 years ago even

543.56 --> 550.25
and wasn't into flat earth yet just read

546.2 --> 553.25
news articles and comment but now what

550.25 --> 560.54
did you even respond to it it's also out

553.25 --> 563.66
of insane that I'm sometimes like seeing

560.54 --> 566.4499999999999
myself typing like yeah declare war it's

563.66 --> 568.459
like getting really like ah bring out

566.45 --> 572.8000000000001
the weapons and just and then I'm like

568.459 --> 577.01
wait yeah well I'm not gonna post that

572.8 --> 582.05
probably it's not good but it they're

577.01 --> 586.65
trying to like almost troll me into

582.05 --> 589.809
saying this [ __ ] it's crazy

586.65 --> 589.809
[Music]

599.27 --> 607.16
all right and and apparently yeah this

602.63 --> 609.86
whole riot situation started with the

607.16 --> 612.41
what is it guy in America the black guy

609.86 --> 614.6
with the with the cop with his knee on

612.41 --> 617.87
his neck and all that [ __ ] it was pretty

614.6 --> 621.589
disgusting to see that but yeah it's

617.87 --> 623.36
like the left machine and the t5 black

621.589 --> 625.97
lives matters I know they're they're

623.36 --> 629.779
like making a move now at that [ __ ] I've

625.97 --> 632.149
been doing it for a while and it's

629.779 --> 636.14
echoing it's not just the USA you know

632.149 --> 639.41
it's like being tackled like the

636.14 --> 641.149
politics people here leftist are like

639.41 --> 644.5699999999999
doing stuff with that it there's like

641.149 --> 647.029
protests organized in response to that

644.57 --> 649.339
here in the Netherlands apparently and

647.029 --> 650.899
yet I've been kind of staring at it from

649.339 --> 653.589
a distance because I just don't want to

650.899 --> 656.81
get too involved it's just so

653.589 --> 660.649
embarrassing everything about it is just

656.81 --> 664.8199999999999
so incredibly embarrassing today it's

660.649 --> 669.16
like no what are you doing you're so

664.82 --> 674.3000000000001
dumb why are you falling for this [ __ ]

669.16 --> 678.829
yeah but yeah sorrows and all that is

674.3 --> 682.31
like funding people situations here too

678.829 --> 686.3599999999999
and it's likely all these moves going

682.31 --> 691.13
down and and there's more more people

686.36 --> 693.95
also coming out just from all kinds of

691.13 --> 697.25
regions that are just sick of this

693.95 --> 699.95
supposed Korona response you know from

697.25 --> 703.19
multiple angles whether they think it it

699.95 --> 705.5200000000001
is real or even going on or like no it's

703.19 --> 708.5600000000001
definitely not real it's a media hoax or

705.52 --> 713.77
like it's not even possible because of

708.56 --> 718.459
yeah the more researched medical

713.77 --> 722.029
alternatives basically right it's like

718.459 --> 724.31
everybody's sick of it and there's no

722.029 --> 726.5
proof that that social distancing makes

724.31 --> 728.27
any kind of difference and it's echoing

726.5 --> 730.37
just everywhere

728.27 --> 734.15
where it's like everybody's sick of it

730.37 --> 735.8
and it's echoing it's almost like the

734.15 --> 738.98
mainstream news you know when I even

735.8 --> 740.8399999999999
turn it on it's still just spouting

738.98 --> 742.13
nonsense about like everything is about

740.84 --> 744.38
social this thing it's like the only

742.13 --> 745.79
thing that matters in a situation you

744.38 --> 748.97
know it's like oh this went wrong that

745.79 --> 751.61
would but did he do this is it a proper

748.97 --> 755.36
application is it responsible and often

751.61 --> 757.34
in relation to the corona crisis but at

755.36 --> 760.73
the same time everybody that's actually

757.34 --> 763.37
gonna talk outside of that mainstream

760.73 --> 766.9300000000001
source is just everybody sick of it

763.37 --> 771.23
everybody's like done they're all like

766.93 --> 777.0799999999999
working on like getting it out of the

771.23 --> 781.52
way like how do you respond from a legal

777.08 --> 783.74
perspective like like yeah finding

781.52 --> 784.4
people for corona measures is not even

783.74 --> 787.58
legal

784.4 --> 790.37
that kind of situation and like Medical

787.58 --> 792.98
Response like is it even responsible to

790.37 --> 796.34
bid and to put those ventilators on

792.98 --> 801.07
people that suppose they have that no

796.34 --> 804.35
it's not and and it's just it is so much

801.07 --> 807.08
like everything is just exposed

804.35 --> 813.14
everything and but it's still happening

807.08 --> 816.14
though it's still it's not being like

813.14 --> 819.11
halted as a response to me it seems like

816.14 --> 822.08
the people that are doing it that are

819.11 --> 825.4
like unfolding this plan kind of know

822.08 --> 825.4000000000001
what it is

828.62 --> 832.9
when what is it DANC

837.63 --> 843.6899999999999
all right I kind of agree I think this

840.72 --> 844.53
is just a coup from the corporate world

843.69 --> 847.74
government

844.53 --> 851.1
this is a slow coup through financial

847.74 --> 856.26
suppression that turn us into a neo

851.1 --> 858.33
feudal technocracy delusional state

856.26 --> 862.5
state where everybody's imprisoned by

858.33 --> 867.4200000000001
delusional lies and then our Forrester

862.5 --> 869.64
basically dance circus acts just to

867.42 --> 871.9799999999999
fulfill the rules for the things that

869.64 --> 875.79
aren't even there I think that's the

871.98 --> 881.58
hell we're all gonna approach some

875.79 --> 883.89
points I don't know unless we all just

881.58 --> 885.8100000000001
say okay that's been very nice now and

883.89 --> 888.96
now we're going to [ __ ] kill you all

885.81 --> 891.4499999999999
like those people that are known to fund

888.96 --> 894.09
this [ __ ] and like yeah no no no we're

891.45 --> 897.32
not going to military you know people

894.09 --> 899.73
are just gonna this is where he lives

897.32 --> 902.94
everybody's gonna pick up something and

899.73 --> 906.47
then walk towards it and then you don't

902.94 --> 911.85
stop that situation you remember 82

906.47 --> 914.4
right because this isn't gonna grow any

911.85 --> 916.74
less is this what everybody wants we

914.4 --> 919.38
know what what's gonna turn out where

916.74 --> 920.82
this is gonna turn to we know exactly

919.38 --> 923.4
where it's gonna go it's all written

920.82 --> 926.45
down we've all been told we're seeing it

923.4 --> 930.3299999999999
step by step proofing what has been told

926.45 --> 933.0
so is there everybody okay it's like no

930.33 --> 937.6800000000001
we're just gonna say it's bad and that's

933.0 --> 940.68
enough we're just gonna say no no now

937.68 --> 945.54
well they don't really care though don't

940.68 --> 948.75
seem to really even like do anything

945.54 --> 950.8199999999999
about that they're just picking at

948.75 --> 952.71
people that are still kind of tied in

950.82 --> 954.4200000000001
their system and like they don't step

952.71 --> 957.0
out of line or will just kick you out

954.42 --> 961.56
and then after that ignore you slander

957.0 --> 962.82
and ignore so yeah what's it gonna be

961.56 --> 965.64
people of the world

962.82 --> 968.12
how much do you not like this do you

965.64 --> 968.12
like this

968.16 --> 974.61
in a do you not like it in a way that

971.36 --> 978.269
you're just gonna say hmm I don't like

974.61 --> 980.85
this or are you gonna not like it in a

978.269 --> 987.9590000000001
way that you're gonna say okay I'm not

980.85 --> 990.74
going to allow this to continue which

987.959 --> 990.7399999999999
one isn't going to be

991.24 --> 994.44
[Music]

998.529 --> 1001.159
right

1002.459 --> 1008.7399999999999
you know what's really hanging over

1005.829 --> 1011.41
everybody's heads what is really hanging

1008.74 --> 1014.95
over our heads in what happens when we

1011.41 --> 1021.13
do that when we just really stop them

1014.95 --> 1023.97
you know there's too many people to make

1021.13 --> 1023.97
it impossible

1030.06 --> 1033.96
you know because I don't care about

1032.04 --> 1039.23
their identity I don't care what they

1033.96 --> 1042.45
believe in I just find it unacceptable

1039.23 --> 1044.25
the the outlook of the world that

1042.45 --> 1047.5800000000002
they're building right under our noses

1044.25 --> 1052.74
in our backyards pretty much everywhere

1047.58 --> 1057.3899999999999
I find that unacceptable it's like you

1052.74 --> 1060.69
really feel like living in like a pseudo

1057.39 --> 1064.65
held the rest of your life to just go

1060.69 --> 1068.52
along to get along with just shameful

1064.65 --> 1071.3400000000001
disgusting [ __ ] lies and virtue

1068.52 --> 1075.27
signaling that means absolutely nothing

1071.34 --> 1077.9099999999999
it's like scarring yourself it's like oh

1075.27 --> 1080.4
which piece of your so are you gonna

1077.91 --> 1084.93
sacrifice today to live another day you

1080.4 --> 1090.3300000000002
[ __ ] you little piece of [ __ ] you slave

1084.93 --> 1092.6100000000001
scum [ __ ] that let this happen what

1090.33 --> 1097.1299999999999
piece of your soul are you gonna cut off

1092.61 --> 1104.1899999999998
for the machine today just to get by

1097.13 --> 1106.3500000000001
what's it gonna be and that's not me

1104.19 --> 1109.25
telling it to them that's the that's the

1106.35 --> 1115.01
Machine making them do that

1109.25 --> 1121.05
you know how far are you willing to sing

1115.01 --> 1123.03
like and this is like to status this is

1121.05 --> 1126.75
like to going along to get along people

1123.03 --> 1129.3
like would you literally eat your own

1126.75 --> 1132.93
[ __ ] on camera as part of a virtuous

1129.3 --> 1135.6
signaling because somehow it got there

1132.93 --> 1138.42
and it was normalized in some way and it

1135.6 --> 1142.59
meant something special would you eat

1138.42 --> 1146.97
[ __ ] to go along to get along on camera

1142.59 --> 1149.1499999999999
you filthy scumbag [ __ ] would you do

1146.97 --> 1149.15
it

1151.95 --> 1175.81
can't wait can't wait to see psychos eat

1157.15 --> 1185.47
their own [ __ ] to make a point just so

1175.81 --> 1187.1499999999999
you know where it's coming not good

1185.47 --> 1189.49
servant I don't think the world is even

1187.15 --> 1190.51
in bad shape I think that the people are

1189.49 --> 1192.82
in bad shape

1190.51 --> 1193.45
I think that people's souls are in bad

1192.82 --> 1197.23
shape

1193.45 --> 1201.27
I think that people has have basically

1197.23 --> 1205.93
just laid through their responsibility

1201.27 --> 1210.58
to decide for a way too long and they

1205.93 --> 1215.02
just let this disgusting [ __ ] unfold for

1210.58 --> 1217.6899999999998
too long so the world is still pretty

1215.02 --> 1221.47
fine you know world's doing actually

1217.69 --> 1224.26
great like there's more available more

1221.47 --> 1227.14
resources more efficiency less pollution

1224.26 --> 1232.45
that there ever was and will get better

1227.14 --> 1236.88
even if you just stick to not letting

1232.45 --> 1240.82
these psycho scumbags turn us into

1236.88 --> 1244.9
self-destructing freaks you know that's

1240.82 --> 1247.87
all mr. all it's a big one but dude we

1244.9 --> 1250.9
got to do it or anything that's around

1247.87 --> 1254.52
us everything we got it's all gonna be

1250.9 --> 1258.16
literally wasted and burned and

1254.52 --> 1261.25
forgotten and there will be stuff made

1258.16 --> 1263.88
that people won't even know how to

1261.25 --> 1268.69
[ __ ] operate it anymore

1263.88 --> 1274.3200000000002
because they're too [ __ ] [ __ ] how

1268.69 --> 1274.3200000000002
about that huh

1279.39 --> 1287.3400000000001
sound familiar by the way hmm

1282.25 --> 1287.34
think that's this the first time that

1288.06 --> 1293.6499999999999
the world the people in the world have

1290.44 --> 1296.68
basically eroded their knowledge over

1293.65 --> 1299.0800000000002
how things work think this is going to

1296.68 --> 1301.93
be the first time that we're gonna lose

1299.08 --> 1316.4399999999998
grip over something that's built all

1301.93 --> 1319.8600000000001
around us the [ __ ] are you talking about

1316.44 --> 1319.8600000000001
GB FN

1327.53 --> 1335.36
so yeah I'm bitter art of the tongue

1330.44 --> 1338.54
today we get a little pissed off because

1335.36 --> 1343.1899999999998
I I really [ __ ] hate communism I

1338.54 --> 1346.6399999999999
really do it's pretty much my archenemy

1343.19 --> 1348.8300000000002
in general it's I can't even say like

1346.64 --> 1351.5900000000001
who I'm on some other side that

1348.83 --> 1356.12
traditionally hates that no I just hate

1351.59 --> 1363.9399999999998
them maybe you could call me aunty come

1356.12 --> 1363.9399999999998
how about that aunty come I like that

1377.539 --> 1380.71
I said too much

1384.45 --> 1390.6200000000001
right

1386.12 --> 1392.809
no no no no no no no now that that's

1390.62 --> 1396.7399999999998
your perverted mind that immediately

1392.809 --> 1399.559
took that and turn it into a squirt no

1396.74 --> 1404.419
no you know what five stands for right

1399.559 --> 1411.98
oh wait I I got it wrong oops so with

1404.419 --> 1415.99
the oh right but people will definitely

1411.98 --> 1415.99
hear it in that antique um

1421.46 --> 1434.6100000000001
anyway yeah these things just happen

1425.88 --> 1437.2800000000002
they just pop into mind yeah but I

1434.61 --> 1439.05
freaking hate them and they don't even

1437.28 --> 1440.45
deserve it because they're just too

1439.05 --> 1443.94
[ __ ] stupid

1440.45 --> 1446.88
there is no smart ant if a person they

1443.94 --> 1452.01
don't exist except their controllers

1446.88 --> 1455.0900000000001
literally handlers they're just yeah rad

1452.01 --> 1464.37
radford is psychopathic maniacs usually

1455.09 --> 1466.1699999999998
creepy yeah and we all know where it

1464.37 --> 1469.9199999999998
coming from right communism

1466.17 --> 1473.22
it's communism is like one of the the

1469.92 --> 1476.28
most sadistic evil things ever because

1473.22 --> 1478.71
it it tries to lure you in with on the

1476.28 --> 1482.61
surface seemingly good concept in

1478.71 --> 1485.15
principles but as you progress in your

1482.61 --> 1488.78
understanding and in your historical

1485.15 --> 1491.2800000000002
research you just figure out it's a

1488.78 --> 1495.21
psychological control mechanism because

1491.28 --> 1497.52
the final goal of communism is absolute

1495.21 --> 1502.98
mind control is the loss of

1497.52 --> 1506.16
individualism is using technology to

1502.98 --> 1507.77
take over to strip away what it means to

1506.16 --> 1513.39
be human

1507.77 --> 1515.46
literally that's the like the final

1513.39 --> 1520.26
consequence this is how it transit

1515.46 --> 1522.8400000000001
that's how transhumanism is integrated

1520.26 --> 1526.67
into it how you genex even is like it's

1522.84 --> 1531.0
all compatible with that mechanism

1526.67 --> 1533.16
because communism is so easily

1531.0 --> 1536.57
programmable everything is about easy

1533.16 --> 1539.13
programs for the base layer of

1536.57 --> 1541.59
consciousness that's what it's all a

1539.13 --> 1544.91
minute and it works so efficiently it

1541.59 --> 1544.9099999999999
works too efficiently

1548.519 --> 1552.76
and yeah

1550.48 --> 1554.679
the drones they don't even know what the

1552.76 --> 1557.74
[ __ ] they're doing or they do know and

1554.679 --> 1561.909
they're just like doubling down demons

1557.74 --> 1563.98
there is a yeah destroy it all ah you

1561.909 --> 1569.97
stupid retards you are letting us

1563.98 --> 1569.97
destroy it all you know

1571.87 --> 1580.09
like for a brief period I kind of felt

1577.03 --> 1583.809
that like wow if people are dumb enough

1580.09 --> 1586.87
to let this exist it allowed us to

1583.809 --> 1588.79
happen then they deserve it that was

1586.87 --> 1593.59
kind of my initial response when I

1588.79 --> 1596.07
figured it out for the first time what

1593.59 --> 1599.79
what and Tifa and all that really was

1596.07 --> 1604.33
what I've gotten myself tied into

1599.79 --> 1609.61
indirectly and then I didn't want to be

1604.33 --> 1611.1399999999999
part of that also didn't really want to

1609.61 --> 1613.99
get in their way I knew it was dangerous

1611.14 --> 1616.8090000000002
for like would be like among because

1613.99 --> 1622.809
they get pretty fanatical if you oppose

1616.809 --> 1628.08
them it's gotta be careful with that but

1622.809 --> 1628.08
if you yeah we're just an average guy

1630.09 --> 1636.03
anyway no

1672.3 --> 1677.1599999999999
anyway yeah I miss being silent for a

1674.79 --> 1683.7
second it's just crazy conversation that

1677.16 --> 1685.559
just appeared out of nowhere yeah

1683.7 --> 1688.74
anyway I'm not happy about them I'm not

1685.559 --> 1695.1299999999999
happy about these groups and their

1688.74 --> 1698.34
actions and you know the worst thing is

1695.13 --> 1700.65
is that that there's just political

1698.34 --> 1704.1
groups that are actually trying to use

1700.65 --> 1705.8700000000001
and abuse them that's what's the worst

1704.1 --> 1708.4199999999998
about if they were just a bunch of

1705.87 --> 1710.6399999999999
stupid retards wanting something that's

1708.42 --> 1713.8500000000001
absolutely ludicrous that'd be one thing

1710.64 --> 1718.01
you know that's what to me originally

1713.85 --> 1720.87
the idea of like neo-nazi marches lagrua

1718.01 --> 1723.12
yeah it's like yeah nobody really wants

1720.87 --> 1725.76
that so you're just it is for that but

1723.12 --> 1728.25
hey if you want to show that you're

1725.76 --> 1732.6
idiots fine that's kind of hot what it

1728.25 --> 1736.14
feels like to me you know but yeah

1732.6 --> 1738.809
politics is doing stuff with these

1736.14 --> 1740.97
people there's like weird little gags

1738.809 --> 1744.2
happening where police is kinda helping

1740.97 --> 1748.2
them and [ __ ] and it's just like no

1744.2 --> 1750.69
that's bad if it was just freaking

1748.2 --> 1753.24
auntie fab being morons in a corner

1750.69 --> 1755.3400000000001
somewhere no that's okay that's fine you

1753.24 --> 1760.5
know morons need a place to do something

1755.34 --> 1766.01
to but the problem is is that it's being

1760.5 --> 1766.01
utilized that makes it even worse

1772.13 --> 1775.239
[Music]

1791.38 --> 1799.2990000000002
debate Fe and Mauro of course everybody

1796.51 --> 1803.62

1799.299 --> 1805.57
debate show now it's not strange you

1803.62 --> 1809.1299999999999
know who wouldn't want to be part of a

1805.57 --> 1809.1299999999999
flat earth debate show so they're all

1809.16 --> 1812.46
whatever men

1821.139 --> 1826.129
this guy this is nuts perky scheming

1824.239 --> 1828.669
this is not disperse chemo he doesn't

1826.129 --> 1828.6689999999999

1840.45 --> 1851.5900000000001
[Music]

1845.56 --> 1851.59
it's Hosea yeah good damn well be

1854.29 --> 1860.33
alright but if people want to make

1857.3 --> 1862.81
videos of me in my crazy loud moments

1860.33 --> 1866.4499999999998
and my passionate moments right I

1862.81 --> 1869.3899999999999
understand because how else are they

1866.45 --> 1871.94
gonna deal with that they can't handle

1869.39 --> 1873.95
that I actually have feelings and that

1871.94 --> 1878.21
I'll just put them down just like that

1873.95 --> 1880.64
very raw but actually with some meaning

1878.21 --> 1883.13
and not just so oh look I'm so energetic

1880.64 --> 1885.71
no no I'm letting that out because I

1883.13 --> 1886.16
have no choice because it's pressing on

1885.71 --> 1888.8
me

1886.16 --> 1891.68
it's the difference but hey if they want

1888.8 --> 1894.9199999999998
to make these weird little videos and

1891.68 --> 1898.73
just be like how are we so crazy oh it's

1894.92 --> 1900.8000000000002
so crazy it's so awesome at the replay

1898.73 --> 1902.6
that all day long it's it's like the

1900.8 --> 1905.18
only way they can get the nightmares

1902.6 --> 1907.55
away of the parts when they didn't sound

1905.18 --> 1910.3400000000001
all that crazy you know they don't want

1907.55 --> 1912.86
to remember that so then they use their

1910.34 --> 1918.22
little silly moments videos to kind of

1912.86 --> 1918.2199999999998
forget about it and that's fine

1920.03 --> 1928.22
well good Aries 106 I I should be

1924.41 --> 1929.8400000000001
entertaining like I have a daily show if

1928.22 --> 1933.25
I'm not going to be entertaining that's

1929.84 --> 1933.25
gonna be a bad situation

1961.15 --> 1964.3190000000002
[Music]

1971.18 --> 1975.17
no but that's funny actually

1975.29 --> 1989.52
right yeah I have a yeah you're getting

1986.88 --> 1993.0
a bit dirty there but yeah good surfing

1989.52 --> 1994.77
there are those videos oh they're

1993.0 --> 1998.37
probably edited together as well because

1994.77 --> 2002.42
Owen has had their his themed periods

1998.37 --> 2006.59
about that you know about the phallus

2002.42 --> 2010.28
worship and they were very great like I

2006.59 --> 2012.59
have personal experience with that in an

2010.28 --> 2016.78
indirect way it's weird don't want to

2012.59 --> 2016.78
really talk about it too much

2018.94 --> 2024.97
not in any fucked-up way by the way but

2022.1 --> 2028.6399999999999
like yeah I can atone to that oh yeah

2024.97 --> 2030.98
it's like in my family we were sort of

2028.64 --> 2033.8600000000001
confronted with that that is the case

2030.98 --> 2037.18
and we were or at least my parents who

2033.86 --> 2044.35
are kind of inspired by that Ida period

2037.18 --> 2047.3500000000001
that's weird and it does things it's

2044.35 --> 2047.35
yeah

2052.42 --> 2058.84
secret King that's not it's not really

2055.88 --> 2061.55
secret King is psychology

2058.84 --> 2064.81
you know the whole phallus worship that

2061.55 --> 2069.4100000000003
is that psychology

2064.81 --> 2071.6
it's like programmed responses it is

2069.41 --> 2075.46
like our natural programming how do we

2071.6 --> 2082.79
respond to these things how do we

2075.46 --> 2091.85
project our longings and all that it's

2082.79 --> 2093.44
been yeah tinkered into a fine art yeah

2091.85 --> 2099.2
and there's entire buildings now made

2093.44 --> 2104.06
like that that's that episode of own

2099.2 --> 2111.29
Benjamin clearly demonstrated

2104.06 --> 2111.29
[Music]

2129.32 --> 2132.67
yeah thanks tank

2134.83 --> 2144.85
all right oh when I speak in anger

2137.2 --> 2147.8399999999997
sometimes it yeah it just but I just

2144.85 --> 2147.8399999999997
comes out like that

2151.08 --> 2156.12
the problem is is that sometimes a lot

2154.02 --> 2159.5099999999998
of things on my mind that I kind of

2156.12 --> 2163.04
don't agree with in a way and anger in a

2159.51 --> 2165.3900000000003
way forces those things to the front

2163.04 --> 2168.18
almost makes me deal with it in the

2165.39 --> 2172.23
moment it's weird because I have a lot

2168.18 --> 2175.23
of inner conflict like concerning the

2172.23 --> 2177.54
things that I see that I take note of

2175.23 --> 2179.85
and the thoughts that come to mind I

2177.54 --> 2182.73
have a lot of inner conflict like really

2179.85 --> 2186.14
conflict it's not leading to any

2182.73 --> 2189.48
physical or ration or anything but

2186.14 --> 2194.749
sometimes it over stresses me

2189.48 --> 2194.749
[Music]

2206.4 --> 2209.4
yeah

2213.46 --> 2221.98
it's not sighs gentlemen its

2215.68 --> 2226.6299999999997
self-control he right the size is when

2221.98 --> 2229.6
the it's like spirit size and yeah

2226.63 --> 2231.13
phallus size the spirit is not good

2229.6 --> 2235.66
enough yeah well do you always cut the

2231.13 --> 2238.2400000000002
phallus I think it kind of works like

2235.66 --> 2242.0699999999997
that really and the problem is there's

2238.24 --> 2247.0299999999997
just plenty of people with yeah palaces

2242.07 --> 2253.2400000000002
you know just not enough people with big

2247.03 --> 2258.2400000000002
spirit so yeah the secondary option kind

2253.24 --> 2258.24
of becomes the economy at it

2283.13 --> 2286.13
yeah

2309.5 --> 2314.93
you know what what's kind of weird Robin

2311.78 --> 2318.53
Stanley like I should describe how I

2314.93 --> 2322.25
felt like how I am attracted to women

2318.53 --> 2324.4700000000003
but that I'd like I can't find like an

2322.25 --> 2328.4
angle like how do I approach this what

2324.47 --> 2331.5499999999997
do i what do I even do is this like in

2328.4 --> 2338.569
no like how do you talk to payroll I

2331.55 --> 2340.67
seem to forget in the moment but I feel

2338.569 --> 2345.56
like I'm like a fully loaded battery

2340.67 --> 2347.75
sometimes like I got all this like our

2345.56 --> 2352.99
and Benjamin says like I am ready for a

2347.75 --> 2359.23
woman in a way but at the same time like

2352.99 --> 2363.3799999999997
there's no the connection like the

2359.23 --> 2367.819
there's no opening I got this power

2363.38 --> 2371.359
story at me but there's no no exit yeah

2367.819 --> 2373.52
there's no connection option so I

2371.359 --> 2376.19
literally I don't know if this is really

2373.52 --> 2379.0099999999998
my fantasy it could be you know when

2376.19 --> 2381.05
you're really feeling like that the

2379.01 --> 2384.2900000000004
fantasy does kind of steer you in

2381.05 --> 2387.26
typical thinking like that but I really

2384.29 --> 2390.5299999999997
sometimes feel like there are just women

2387.26 --> 2392.1090000000004
walking around scouting me and they kind

2390.53 --> 2395.869
of have the same issue it's like whoa

2392.109 --> 2398.2999999999997
yeah that looks kind of hot because that

2395.869 --> 2400.369
happens it makes me feel kind of weird

2398.3 --> 2402.619
saying it myself but that just noticed

2400.369 --> 2406.069
that I have the same reaction to some

2402.619 --> 2408.6800000000003
women but they'd have done the same kind

2406.069 --> 2409.91
of echo feel that I get and that is that

2408.68 --> 2412.91
they really don't know what the [ __ ] to

2409.91 --> 2415.91
do with me like I don't know what the

2412.91 --> 2421.16
[ __ ] to do with them like how do you

2415.91 --> 2427.0989999999997
even walk up to one another it's weird

2421.16 --> 2430.25
I think dude those types just rely on

2427.099 --> 2432.17
internet contacting is that how they do

2430.25 --> 2434.96
it that they just like oh I don't know

2432.17 --> 2436.79
how to walk up to somebody but if I

2434.96 --> 2441.56
could get their email address or their

2436.79 --> 2444.0299999999997
skype or their whatsapp or blah blah

2441.56 --> 2448.58
contact somebody of their work that has

2444.03 --> 2451.0800000000004
that then yeah they'll send whatever

2448.58 --> 2459.71
tailored message they like are they like

2451.08 --> 2459.71
that I don't know a very little contact

2463.64 --> 2468.31
God what kind of women in my into I

2469.45 --> 2478.1899999999996
don't know uh well what am i what I am

2475.28 --> 2482.51
into I'm not too sure if that's actually

2478.19 --> 2485.59
good for me and that's probably gonna

2482.51 --> 2485.59
sound very familiar

2492.54 --> 2503.46
but in a way I am very much into

2496.92 --> 2507.39
strength it's I I used to need it I have

2503.46 --> 2511.89
basically taken upon the taking it upon

2507.39 --> 2516.2999999999997
myself to do it myself to become strong

2511.89 --> 2518.37
spirited but I do very much I would very

2516.3 --> 2520.77
much appreciate just a very strong

2518.37 --> 2523.5299999999997
confident spirited woman doesn't have to

2520.77 --> 2532.23
be big and strong as long as they are

2523.53 --> 2534.3300000000004
like like they can just uphold good

2532.23 --> 2537.2400000000002
energy so they can be strong and wise I

2534.33 --> 2539.58
need that because I have a lot of issues

2537.24 --> 2541.6699999999996
that I need to deal with and they need

2539.58 --> 2543.75
to be able to survive that

2541.67 --> 2545.76
psychologically not physically there's

2543.75 --> 2554.1
never a problem physically trust me

2545.76 --> 2556.2200000000003
never you know right Amazons I don't

2554.1 --> 2556.22
know

2558.829 --> 2568.8900000000003
would she have to believe in Flat Earth

2561.469 --> 2575.609
well it would be a great energy drain if

2568.89 --> 2578.19
she didn't unless she's a yeah a globe

2575.609 --> 2581.64
wizard like unless she's kinda like me

2578.19 --> 2582.42
and it's like yeah I know but it's so

2581.64 --> 2586.799
much fun

2582.42 --> 2594.589
and I'm I kind of know the consequences

2586.799 --> 2598.41
I don't know the date but it would

2594.589 --> 2607.339
probably be better for my own progress

2598.41 --> 2611.0389999999998
too if if they were just not not so much

2607.339 --> 2617.43
engaged in government based religions as

2611.039 --> 2622.039
it were they were example like anything

2617.43 --> 2625.469
and anything other than absolutely anti

2622.039 --> 2633.42
Corona measures that I just immediately

2625.469 --> 2636.4500000000003
step away just instantly like like you

2633.42 --> 2639.15
have to really freaking defend that for

2636.45 --> 2641.43
some like if if they would say what I'm

2639.15 --> 2643.38
wearing a mask because these people that

2641.43 --> 2647.94
I really care about they're afraid of it

2643.38 --> 2651.869
and like okay that's just kind of sweet

2647.94 --> 2653.489
but if they would if that was just an

2651.869 --> 2655.4990000000003
excuse and they're actually kind of

2653.489 --> 2659.93
hiding they're afraid of it for real

2655.499 --> 2659.93
then it's problematic like

2661.51 --> 2667.63
if you can't handle a figuring out

2665.41 --> 2670.75
reality to such level that you'll fall

2667.63 --> 2675.28
back on that type of base level

2670.75 --> 2679.0
deception from government then I how can

2675.28 --> 2682.9
I rely on that how can I lean on anybody

2679.0 --> 2687.46
like that you know they're just gonna

2682.9 --> 2690.34
fall back on the yeah government program

2687.46 --> 2696.07
just like that you can build on anybody

2690.34 --> 2699.9700000000003
like that so psyche is very important

2696.07 --> 2704.55
and a good psyche chemistry to me is

2699.97 --> 2709.14
like it's really sexy I find it like

2704.55 --> 2712.7200000000003
like yeah a woman can have like very

2709.14 --> 2715.24
sexual nice features and all that but if

2712.72 --> 2718.39
their mind is like really annoying and

2715.24 --> 2720.7599999999998
stupid then even if they just shut up

2718.39 --> 2723.58
it's just not gonna work it's like yeah

2720.76 --> 2728.98
this is like having sex with a with a

2723.58 --> 2731.29
with a doll kind of yeah doesn't work

2728.98 --> 2733.57
it's just no chemistry

2731.29 --> 2736.48
but if they have a lot of inner

2733.57 --> 2739.15
chemistry and and feelings and thoughts

2736.48 --> 2743.109
and like a personal quests and dreams

2739.15 --> 2745.54
and that are like decent have a decent

2743.109 --> 2753.609
level yeah I find that like incredibly

2745.54 --> 2755.83
invigorating so yeah with my ex in a way

2753.609 --> 2758.91
it was like a really lucky combination

2755.83 --> 2763.48
because she was incredibly well shaped

2758.91 --> 2765.1299999999997
but she was also pretty brilliant and

2763.48 --> 2767.31
that was it was too much for me to

2765.13 --> 2767.31
handle

2775.31 --> 2784.91
and the problem was is that she couldn't

2779.99 --> 2787.1299999999997
make emotional contact not really like

2784.91 --> 2792.5299999999997
afterward I kind of figured out also

2787.13 --> 2800.87
that like she can't even really fall in

2792.53 --> 2804.02
love she like like in a way I knew you

2800.87 --> 2808.37
know and it just wanted to make her feel

2804.02 --> 2811.4
great but it wasn't in love because that

2808.37 --> 2813.35
has like these these hard consequences

2811.4 --> 2818.1800000000003
and she didn't show any symptoms she

2813.35 --> 2824.98
didn't show any like oh yeah I want this

2818.18 --> 2824.98
for us or for you so bad not really

2827.67 --> 2831.589
still pretty good girlfriend though

2843.299 --> 2846.169
anyway

2866.76 --> 2869.3590000000004
yeah

2873.98 --> 2880.16
well we have it you don't have to go

2877.64 --> 2884.5
around and think of the shape of the

2880.16 --> 2888.56
earth on a daily basis actively to be

2884.5 --> 2890.869
confronted and respond to related issues

2888.56 --> 2892.49
on a daily basis because we're being

2890.869 --> 2894.98
confronted with the globe in the shape

2892.49 --> 2898.6699999999996
of the earth every single day every day

2894.98 --> 2901.099
in a lot of things especially if you

2898.67 --> 2905.39
don't realize it because you're gonna

2901.099 --> 2911.77
see it with every movie with every news

2905.39 --> 2917.0
bulletin yeah it's everywhere

2911.77 --> 2922.46
so yeah if they don't know that they are

2917.0 --> 2926.47
going to then draw those systems that we

2922.46 --> 2929.69
are constantly being presented with in

2926.47 --> 2933.3489999999997
in your lives not knowing that they're

2929.69 --> 2937.16
basically fake so yeah it's yeah you

2933.349 --> 2939.71
kind of incorrectly have average person

2937.16 --> 2942.02
does think about the shape of the earth

2939.71 --> 2945.4900000000002
on a daily basis they do they just don't

2942.02 --> 2949.099
realize it it's automated

2945.49 --> 2952.1499999999996
it's just grafted into their habits by

2949.099 --> 2952.15
what they're exposed to

2955.33 --> 2964.72
oh I do John Bernards Wow that I don't

2962.11 --> 2966.13
know about that but I do my best to

2964.72 --> 2970.48
maintain it though

2966.13 --> 2973.9
I guess there's a lot of wonders in my

2970.48 --> 2978.61
mind sometimes healthy or I do my best

2973.9 --> 2984.19
for that but yeah sometimes what comes

2978.61 --> 2986.53
out so but a on the other hand I'm doing

2984.19 --> 2998.9500000000003
my best to put down the right thing the

2986.53 --> 3003.9300000000003
best things here you disagree based on

2998.95 --> 3010.29
what you have so we're not being

3003.93 --> 3015.56
confronted with globes constantly it's

3010.29 --> 3018.8
not just in view a lot of the time I

3015.56 --> 3018.7999999999997
think it is

3027.9 --> 3031.469
[Music]

3043.83 --> 3047.0099999999998
all right

3048.49 --> 3053.589
yeah the average people are lost in a

3050.619 --> 3056.83
world of lies or or you could see it

3053.589 --> 3059.5
that it's just information to them it's

3056.83 --> 3061.48
information that is familiar with others

3059.5 --> 3064.33
so others will deal with that

3061.48 --> 3069.369
information because can you personally

3064.33 --> 3073.38
confirm even one percent of all the

3069.369 --> 3076.33
information you ever handle not really

3073.38 --> 3078.07
you can reason it out you can work on it

3076.33 --> 3081.52
you can figure it out you can do all

3078.07 --> 3084.4300000000003
kinds of things but absolute

3081.52 --> 3093.55
confirmation like firsthand testing

3084.43 --> 3098.41
that's most things aren't now I lost my

3093.55 --> 3101.4
point oh I'll get back to me information

3098.41 --> 3101.3999999999996
firsthand

3104.7 --> 3112.319
right well the flies so to those people

3109.02 --> 3114.599
that don't know their lies it's just the

3112.319 --> 3115.619
common information it's this story that

3114.599 --> 3118.65
everybody knows

3115.619 --> 3121.319
so most people added that are deep in it

3118.65 --> 3124.4100000000003
they're not concerned with what is true

3121.319 --> 3128.43
what is not true they're not focused on

3124.41 --> 3135.92
that now they're focused on what matters

3128.43 --> 3140.2799999999997
and what has become irrelevant see

3135.92 --> 3143.069
that's how they wield things when you're

3140.28 --> 3143.9100000000003
deep into that when you're not concerned

3143.069 --> 3147.24
with the truth

3143.91 --> 3149.73
it just becomes as to a tenable subject

3147.24 --> 3152.22
do people talk about it do they want to

3149.73 --> 3156.69
hear you talk about it what is kind of

3152.22 --> 3158.43
said about it oh well if you then echo

3156.69 --> 3160.38
things that are said about it it will

3158.43 --> 3161.97
risk well you get response from the

3160.38 --> 3162.599
world they'll be like yeah we heard that

3161.97 --> 3165.39
too

3162.599 --> 3173.88
see it doesn't matter if it's true or

3165.39 --> 3175.5299999999997
not from that perspective because if you

3173.88 --> 3177.9300000000003
really want to figure out if it's true

3175.53 --> 3180.299
or not you have to actually test it it's

3177.93 --> 3186.0299999999997
not about have other people heard about

3180.299 --> 3187.98
it - yeah and that's a lot of extra work

3186.03 --> 3191.369
that a lot of people don't really want

3187.98 --> 3193.53
to get into you know that's still

3191.369 --> 3195.6600000000003
difficult it's much easier to just test

3193.53 --> 3198.349
the waters and see what people are

3195.66 --> 3201.69
talking about what can you say about it

3198.349 --> 3203.52
than to actually test if the details are

3201.69 --> 3206.91
true it's much more difficult for a lot

3203.52 --> 3209.819
of people they'd rather move to their

3206.91 --> 3212.2799999999997
personal discovered expert that can

3209.819 --> 3215.7599999999998
figure it out for them and they rely on

3212.28 --> 3220.88
that I personally in my own way do that

3215.76 --> 3224.5400000000004
as well but I collect a lot of knowledge

3220.88 --> 3229.29
broadly so I don't do it too

3224.54 --> 3232.349
persistently I don't really have real

3229.29 --> 3234.8089999999997
experts I consider myself as the first

3232.349 --> 3236.98
and foremost expert although there are

3234.809 --> 3241.26
people that a little bit better at

3236.98 --> 3244.54
certain things than me and I will

3241.26 --> 3246.8500000000004
respect that I will listen to them

3244.54 --> 3250.99
sometimes but I'm not gonna go to them

3246.85 --> 3251.65
every time to confirm something in that

3250.99 --> 3256.2999999999997
field

3251.65 --> 3258.82
I might sometimes most of the time I try

3256.3 --> 3263.1400000000003
to rely on my own insight and

3258.82 --> 3265.8900000000003
resourcefulness and my source wherever

3263.14 --> 3265.89
that's coming from

3282.01 --> 3289.51
do you think they want Flat Earth to

3284.59 --> 3292.3900000000003
became mainstream fact no way but they

3289.51 --> 3295.3
might be willing to make it into like a

3292.39 --> 3297.73
hippy religion though it's like all the

3295.3 --> 3300.88
flat earthers they just want to believe

3297.73 --> 3304.0
the earth is flat and it's okay they can

3300.88 --> 3308.02
believe it because yeah you know why not

3304.0 --> 3309.49
freedom Leif you can already see that a

3308.02 --> 3312.34
lot of people talking like that it's

3309.49 --> 3313.7799999999997
like yeah the silly flat-earthers now

3312.34 --> 3315.67
there's no real harm in it they're

3313.78 --> 3318.46
really just trying to do good and they

3315.67 --> 3320.02
have interesting stories sometimes about

3318.46 --> 3322.3
take you don't get all the facts wrong

3320.02 --> 3324.34
and we have the science of course you

3322.3 --> 3327.19
know that's really the response so yeah

3324.34 --> 3329.83
they might try to maneuver it in

3327.19 --> 3334.6
becoming viewed as like a fringe

3329.83 --> 3336.46
hippyish religion like like oh they're

3334.6 --> 3338.86
so controversial because they're believe

3336.46 --> 3341.56
the universe is inside out that kind of

3338.86 --> 3344.1
thing right that it could be accepted

3341.56 --> 3346.63
like that that'll be the mainstream view

3344.1 --> 3349.48
but they're never literally gonna say

3346.63 --> 3351.58
okay people everything you've seen in

3349.48 --> 3354.12
the past all those movies everything you

3351.58 --> 3358.42
read in the books all of it it's all

3354.12 --> 3361.69
lies how are you gonna do that is the

3358.42 --> 3365.01
world's gonna burn literally books and

3361.69 --> 3368.77
[ __ ] and people are gonna go [ __ ] nuts

3365.01 --> 3372.7000000000003
there's no way I already tried to say

3368.77 --> 3376.36
this earlier there is no way this can

3372.7 --> 3378.6099999999997
work that it would literally be unfold

3376.36 --> 3380.35
now it'll get a room it's like a fringe

3378.61 --> 3383.08
hippie religion it's like it'll be

3380.35 --> 3386.0499999999997
accepted and people can get there and

3383.08 --> 3387.73
figure out it is real and then deal with

3386.05 --> 3389.5
it somehow and then let's hope they

3387.73 --> 3391.14
don't go nuts and try to destroy the

3389.5 --> 3396.34
world or something you know the

3391.14 --> 3400.54
potential is that's all that's what I

3396.34 --> 3403.0
see that can do that they can do but

3400.54 --> 3406.12
yeah unless you're literally ready to

3403.0 --> 3408.93
just let the entire will be flipped

3406.12 --> 3408.93
upside down

3410.39 --> 3422.7
yeah sorry I can't see it happening you

3419.28 --> 3425.4900000000002
know hey if you'd like to prove me wrong

3422.7 --> 3429.47
I'd like to see a demonstration of that

3425.49 --> 3431.3999999999996
I just can't see this happening without

3429.47 --> 3440.6099999999997
afterworld gong hell

3431.4 --> 3442.76
very quickly it would be you know in the

3440.61 --> 3445.8900000000003
best case scenario it would be like a

3442.76 --> 3448.65
very prolonged moment of extreme

3445.89 --> 3453.7799999999997
flustering and depression where it's

3448.65 --> 3457.29
like wow all that stuff oh this that

3453.78 --> 3460.86
Park that moment this video that that

3457.29 --> 3463.86
that that it's all for nothing that's

3460.86 --> 3466.9700000000003
gonna be like a huge demoralizing dip

3463.86 --> 3476.4300000000003
that would proceed from a official

3466.97 --> 3479.85
situation and I don't know I don't how

3476.43 --> 3481.6189999999997
is some yeah what could come of that you

3479.85 --> 3485.43
know there could be some people that are

3481.619 --> 3490.05
gonna go nuts they're gonna be like like

3485.43 --> 3490.83
so pissed off that so they will feel so

3490.05 --> 3495.8590000000004
used

3490.83 --> 3495.859
like there's no way that could be mended

3505.01 --> 3512.9300000000003
I don't know maybe I'm wrong guys maybe

3508.4 --> 3517.27
I'm being pessimist here but I think

3512.93 --> 3520.46
that in a dual cause mechanical society

3517.27 --> 3523.25
which is like a step after they would be

3520.46 --> 3527.2400000000002
more balanced but it would be regard it

3523.25 --> 3529.07
would be a to view reality where from

3527.24 --> 3530.99
one view the world is still supposed to

3529.07 --> 3533.6600000000003
be a globe and yeah you have these silly

3530.99 --> 3536.75
flat earthers that that are just being

3533.66 --> 3538.1299999999997
controversial you know you gotta be nice

3536.75 --> 3542.29
to them because they don't mean any harm

3538.13 --> 3545.57
and they're just trying to do their best

3542.29 --> 3547.82
to express their religion yeah right

3545.57 --> 3549.8
yeah that's what that side that's how

3547.82 --> 3551.6600000000003
that's gonna be and then on the flat

3549.8 --> 3553.5800000000004
earthers it's gonna be yeah yeah we've

3551.66 --> 3556.37
been here for a while look we got all

3553.58 --> 3558.77
this all this stuff figured out look we

3556.37 --> 3562.2799999999997
actually figured out the geometric

3558.77 --> 3566.06
orientation of the equator and look yeah

3562.28 --> 3568.01
that we found this old map this place

3566.06 --> 3570.47
and look this guy went over there but

3568.01 --> 3575.51
this will all be to that this is not

3570.47 --> 3578.3799999999997
gonna get mainstream attention but that

3575.51 --> 3580.34
could be a dual cause mechanical society

3578.38 --> 3583.04
well it's literally gonna be

3580.34 --> 3584.96
compartmentalize one part the official

3583.04 --> 3587.06
part we'll just say no no no the Flat

3584.96 --> 3589.73
Earth it's just being controversial and

3587.06 --> 3591.65
they're wrong when it's okay and look at

3589.73 --> 3592.73
all the art and the music yeah yeah sure

3591.65 --> 3596.98
there's some good to it you know it's

3592.73 --> 3596.98
like like the sixties revolution mm-hmm

3597.34 --> 3603.5
but yeah at the same time the flat

3599.78 --> 3606.23
earthers will have yeah giants amounts

3603.5 --> 3609.65
of research and things figured out and

3606.23 --> 3611.6
perhaps technology even figured out you

3609.65 --> 3614.12
know who knows maybe we'll be busying

3611.6 --> 3616.25
building freaking pyramids or something

3614.12 --> 3620.75
trying something like that in a small

3616.25 --> 3626.62
scale at some point but officially yeah

3620.75 --> 3630.11
no it can't work you can't be seriously

3626.62 --> 3633.23
