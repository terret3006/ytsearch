95.6 --> 100.479
patreon crypto wallet super chat and the

97.92 --> 103.84
membership system join button

100.479 --> 105.6
that will be much appreciated

103.84 --> 107.60000000000001
so

105.6 --> 110.79899999999999
whether today is

107.6 --> 110.79899999999999
surprisingly warm

113.439 --> 116.32
it really is

116.479 --> 121.439
so

117.439 --> 121.439
it does seem like it's kind of moist

122.079 --> 126.079
still

122.96 --> 127.83999999999999
relatively blue sky up there but also

126.079 --> 130.07999999999998
kind of hazy

127.84 --> 131.03900000000002
so yeah moist

130.08 --> 132.72
and

131.039 --> 137.35999999999999
there is some wind

132.72 --> 137.35999999999999
but yeah the the air is just very warm

139.44 --> 147.04
with the sun coming out about two hours

142.56 --> 149.68
ago for that it was just kind of cloudy

147.04 --> 149.67999999999998
so yeah

152.16 --> 159.2
sometimes amazes me how like how the

155.2 --> 159.2
weather just switches just like that

162.4 --> 166.8
right anyway it's a kind of a mellow

168.84 --> 172.56
sunny sunday

174.319 --> 181.67999999999998
hello cleary first in chat

177.04 --> 181.67999999999998
i was watching kiwi and bob yeah yeah

182.8 --> 186.64000000000001
yeah there was a ball busters yesterday

187.12 --> 191.84
uh

188.959 --> 193.04
but yeah i i to be fair i missed most of

191.84 --> 195.519
it

193.04 --> 198.56
because i was cooking dinner right in

195.519 --> 200.87900000000002
the middle of it

198.56 --> 200.879
right

201.28 --> 204.159
did comment though

204.56 --> 209.28
did lay down my prognosis for the future

210.0 --> 214.959
hello dusty ryder good to see you

223.599 --> 228.79899999999998
yo dusty ryder

225.76 --> 232.239
how would you like a wrench

228.799 --> 232.239
i mean if you're up for it

234.879 --> 239.07999999999998
you can refuse of course

241.04 --> 244.159
but i've seen you around for long enough

242.799 --> 247.87900000000002
to know that

244.159 --> 247.879
i can trust you

256.16 --> 260.32000000000005
anyway

258.079 --> 260.32
uh

260.959 --> 267.96
it is sunday the 26th

264.0 --> 267.96
of september 2021

268.96 --> 273.75899999999996
and still this type of weather

271.199 --> 275.68
isn't that just bizarre

273.759 --> 278.47900000000004
but nice

275.68 --> 279.44
it's not like we're cooking here like oh

278.479 --> 282.15999999999997
no

279.44 --> 285.04
this

282.16 --> 285.04
it's just like a

285.6 --> 289.28000000000003
climate nudge like

289.52 --> 295.03999999999996
it's not like oh my god

292.56 --> 297.68
wildfires are starting because of the

295.04 --> 299.6
heat wave no no no

297.68 --> 301.12
not over here anyway

299.6 --> 303.91900000000004
uh

301.12 --> 305.52
so i kind of like this weather setting i

303.919 --> 308.56
like it i like

305.52 --> 308.56
early summers

309.68 --> 314.24
in may

311.12 --> 316.16
and then late after summers

314.24 --> 317.919
in september i kind of like it it's not

316.16 --> 320.88000000000005
the first time that's happened

317.919 --> 323.44
here in the netherlands

320.88 --> 325.28
but yeah i find it very pleasant

323.44 --> 329.6
anyhow

325.28 --> 329.59999999999997
okay for wrench all right there we go

332.24 --> 336.199
hey seeking star water

338.24 --> 344.40000000000003
researching aromas hmm

341.28 --> 344.4
like aromatherapy

346.08 --> 349.919
how many hadrian colliders

350.08 --> 353.08
uh

356.24 --> 359.36
well more than one

360.16 --> 363.47900000000004
i don't know

366.639 --> 373.199
thirty thousand wow that's bizarre

371.039 --> 377.52
what are they doing with that [ __ ]

373.199 --> 378.72
it's just reading ex exploding

377.52 --> 381.19899999999996
atoms

378.72 --> 384.0
and then just interpreting like dividing

381.199 --> 386.16
the squiggly lines and that 30 000 of

384.0 --> 386.16
them

387.68 --> 392.0
because that's what it is that's what i

389.6 --> 393.36
yeah it sounds very

392.0 --> 396.319
simple right

393.36 --> 399.12
that's what it is hadron collider

396.319 --> 399.12
magnet thing

399.84 --> 404.56
supposedly sending an atom

402.479 --> 406.88
or a particle of some kind

404.56 --> 410.319
whatever they suggest

406.88 --> 411.44
in bouncing into another particle

410.319 --> 413.599
and then

411.44 --> 417.12
some kind of reaction happens and they

413.599 --> 417.12
read the squiggly lines

418.88 --> 423.919
that basically the computer

421.039 --> 425.919
yeah tries to model out for them

423.919 --> 428.79999999999995
because it's extremely elusive what

425.919 --> 430.479
actually happens

428.8 --> 433.599
like with the

430.479 --> 435.68
presumed particle parts right

433.599 --> 438.08
so they end up just reading squiggly

435.68 --> 438.08
lines

439.28 --> 442.96
and that yeah that's what they try to

440.639 --> 445.68
divine and they think they can get some

442.96 --> 447.75899999999996
kind of a figure out a pattern in this

445.68 --> 447.759
and

448.88 --> 454.639
of course it gets grabble because it's

451.12 --> 456.08
very easy to just say oh look

454.639 --> 459.52
based on

456.08 --> 460.56
like 10 out of 10 000 different

459.52 --> 462.79999999999995
models

460.56 --> 466.319
there seems a correlation with this so

462.8 --> 466.319
we're now going to build a uh

466.599 --> 472.479
astrophysics theory

469.52 --> 476.4
modification on that finding on that

472.479 --> 476.4
pattern and it's just complete

476.56 --> 481.759
witchcraft nonsense it's just like oh i

479.68 --> 483.599
see the pattern in the bones and i'm not

481.759 --> 485.36
like bone

483.599 --> 487.36
divining

485.36 --> 488.24
and let's be surprised it's actually a

487.36 --> 491.599
skill

488.24 --> 493.84000000000003
but they grabble it they they've used

491.599 --> 493.84
that

494.479 --> 500.8
more like a carnival attraction just to

497.12 --> 502.319
get things rolling in their favor

500.8 --> 505.199
that's what they're effectively doing

502.319 --> 507.599
it's very bizarre the world we've ended

505.199 --> 509.91900000000004
up with

507.599 --> 511.039
so far

509.919 --> 513.8389999999999
anyway

511.039 --> 517.4399999999999
been watching so owen benjamin

513.839 --> 517.44
almost rounded out the last stream

519.279 --> 523.8389999999999
it's it is

521.279 --> 523.8389999999999
interesting

527.519 --> 531.76
also i watch quantum of consciousness

532.64 --> 535.8389999999999
is it the

536.959 --> 540.88
the frequency map i don't know what he

539.2 --> 543.36
calls it

540.88 --> 546.24
i should look back

543.36 --> 549.04
but yeah that stream and that was from

546.24 --> 550.8
two days ago it was really interesting

549.04 --> 552.64
and i completely forgot to mention about

550.8 --> 555.12
it yesterday

552.64 --> 557.4399999999999
very interesting stuff

555.12 --> 559.92
right of course yesterday oak

557.44 --> 559.9200000000001
i mean

560.839 --> 566.24
yesterday of course there was also flat

563.44 --> 566.24
earth british

569.519 --> 573.16
just kind of a hangout

579.68 --> 584.0799999999999
i don't know

581.68 --> 585.76
it's like a cafe and it's just like okay

584.08 --> 588.88
whatever they're showing on the screen

585.76 --> 588.88
it it's amusing

588.959 --> 593.92
but i don't even know whether martin

591.279 --> 597.279
sometimes actually realizes

593.92 --> 599.5999999999999
like how incohesive he can get when he's

597.279 --> 601.519
talking it's kind of like blabbering ha

599.6 --> 603.2
sorry martin i still like your streams

601.519 --> 605.36
by the way so don't take this as an

603.2 --> 607.36
attack please

605.36 --> 608.24
but sometimes it's just like oh look at

607.36 --> 611.12
that

608.24 --> 614.64
oh isn't that just amazing and it's like

611.12 --> 618.32
very blatantly obvious cgi

614.64 --> 620.48
it's like okay come on

618.32 --> 622.8000000000001
maybe there's people out there that have

620.48 --> 625.44
much more difficulty to really tell it

622.8 --> 628.0
apart but for me sometimes following

625.44 --> 630.24
martin streams is just that game

628.0 --> 632.88
it's like a

630.24 --> 635.279
analysis game i

632.88 --> 637.92
i just look at what he presented and

635.279 --> 639.76
then i figure out okay that's

637.92 --> 643.5999999999999
what that is from what time frame does

639.76 --> 646.399
that come is that cgi is that

643.6 --> 647.9200000000001
a painting sometimes really amazing

646.399 --> 649.68
paintings that are very difficult to

647.92 --> 650.399
tell they're fake

649.68 --> 652.4799999999999
and

650.399 --> 654.64
sometimes actual photographs and

652.48 --> 657.2
sometimes it's photoshopped photographs

654.64 --> 658.3199999999999
and it's like it's really a game for me

657.2 --> 661.12
to really

658.32 --> 663.9200000000001
just instantly try to recognize what

661.12 --> 663.92
what is this

664.079 --> 668.7199999999999
and that's really what i find the most

665.839 --> 671.839
amusing about martin's streams because

668.72 --> 673.519
he just throws everything in a pot and

671.839 --> 675.519
just starts

673.519 --> 678.24
showing you things and telling some

675.519 --> 681.279
story about it

678.24 --> 683.36
but it's always it's never like one type

681.279 --> 685.76
of image it's not just oh let's only

683.36 --> 687.839
paintings so unless he has a very

685.76 --> 689.68
specific theme he likes to address which

687.839 --> 692.32
happens sometimes but most of the times

689.68 --> 694.56
it's just like a giant pot of

692.32 --> 697.519
different images and he just blabbers

694.56 --> 697.5189999999999
alongside it

698.079 --> 702.959
but he has some really interesting

699.92 --> 705.279
images that he has fished up with this

702.959 --> 705.279
team

705.839 --> 708.24
anyway

710.16 --> 713.7199999999999
what's going on

723.6 --> 725.839
what

726.639 --> 733.36
seeking star wars

729.68 --> 733.3599999999999
um what are you saying that

735.6 --> 739.519
hydrogen colliders have created new

738.16 --> 743.88
aromas

739.519 --> 743.88
aroma molecules really

745.6 --> 748.32
that's odd

755.76 --> 759.399
dusty right yeah

761.12 --> 766.0
no well the thing is martin is always

763.04 --> 768.24
kind of in great spirits

766.0 --> 771.519
he doesn't get fazed by [ __ ]

768.24 --> 774.48
and that makes it kind of like a nice

771.519 --> 778.16
place to hang around and yeah his chat

774.48 --> 778.16
is always totally just

779.839 --> 783.6800000000001
so many people in there it's

781.12 --> 785.04
unbelievable

783.68 --> 787.04
and some of them are rambling

785.04 --> 789.8389999999999
incoherently but

787.04 --> 791.519
not aggressively or anything it's just

789.839 --> 794.8800000000001
there's good spirits in there that's

791.519 --> 794.88
what i also like about him

796.56 --> 801.0
good servant what is it

801.279 --> 804.8
why don't you say hello first

811.279 --> 815.32
what kind of an entry is that

825.68 --> 829.92
why don't i have a typical dutch accent

828.079 --> 832.4799999999999
well because i made great effort at a

829.92 --> 836.04
very young age to get rid of that as

832.48 --> 836.04
well as i can

884.399 --> 887.48
all right

899.04 --> 904.88
it is also interesting because

902.24 --> 909.6
because of the sheer amount of

904.88 --> 909.6
imagery that martin has dug up

909.92 --> 913.8389999999999
and getting to see them just like that

914.0 --> 915.92
has

914.88 --> 919.12
kind of

915.92 --> 922.079
made me think a lot about

919.12 --> 924.16
what were they doing when they made that

922.079 --> 927.04
in those times what they were actually

924.16 --> 929.279
doing

927.04 --> 929.279
and

932.56 --> 937.5999999999999
it's just fascinating

934.88 --> 940.24
it's it like never really settles like

937.6 --> 942.24
but i i feel that i see patterns in

940.24 --> 944.72
things

942.24 --> 947.279
i see patterns in everything pretty much

944.72 --> 950.0
but in this case like i feel like it's

947.279 --> 952.48
almost getting so cohesive now

950.0 --> 954.56
in my overview that i might actually at

952.48 --> 957.519
some point be able to

954.56 --> 959.8389999999999
make definitive conclusions about

957.519 --> 963.199
what that all was and what like these

959.839 --> 968.0400000000001
priests legit priests also were doing

963.199 --> 968.04
with their iconography and all that

969.279 --> 973.36
and they're so different

971.279 --> 976.0
because i do think that especially the

973.36 --> 979.279
thing that martin showed

976.0 --> 982.24
yesterday that that was actually

979.279 --> 985.12
propaganda

982.24 --> 986.72
theocratic propaganda

985.12 --> 989.759
you know that it had the feel of it

986.72 --> 993.72
there was a lot wrong with it and the

989.759 --> 993.72
vibe coming off it

998.88 --> 1002.639
because yeah

1000.399 --> 1006.959
i reflect upon all of that

1002.639 --> 1010.48
since my discovery about well what i

1006.959 --> 1012.399
think about jesus

1010.48 --> 1014.9590000000001
things that he said

1012.399 --> 1018.32
and then what proceeded to happen

1014.959 --> 1020.399
after he got out of the picture

1018.32 --> 1023.519
and i am much

1020.399 --> 1024.799
more solidly convinced now that

1023.519 --> 1027.52
the church

1024.799 --> 1029.52
that pretty much came out of it

1027.52 --> 1032.559
was a

1029.52 --> 1034.72
an attempt to basically

1032.559 --> 1036.799
hijack the whole thing

1034.72 --> 1039.52
to hijack jesus's teachings and then

1036.799 --> 1041.36
build an exoteric bubble around it of

1039.52 --> 1043.52
interpretation

1041.36 --> 1045.52
and then tell everybody this is how

1043.52 --> 1047.039
we interpreted this is how you must

1045.52 --> 1049.679
interpret it

1047.039 --> 1051.28
and they even officially i think had a

1049.679 --> 1053.919
long period where

1051.28 --> 1055.9189999999999
the bible was forbidden

1053.919 --> 1059.2
it was only for the priest and they kept

1055.919 --> 1059.2
it all to themselves

1059.919 --> 1062.16
because of that

1061.28 --> 1064.72
like

1062.16 --> 1066.799
that is his already historical fact it's

1064.72 --> 1068.32
even like so

1066.799 --> 1071.12
mainline

1068.32 --> 1074.3999999999999
nobody even questions that but now i see

1071.12 --> 1076.2399999999998
so much more clearly like why

1074.4 --> 1079.1200000000001
why did they do that

1076.24 --> 1081.6
because it was always a spiritual

1079.12 --> 1083.84
hostile takeover operation the whole

1081.6 --> 1083.84
thing

1088.32 --> 1095.84
and it operated as such

1091.039 --> 1095.84
what people in it were tasked to do

1096.24 --> 1101.84
it operated towards that

1100.0 --> 1104.16
towards doing that

1101.84 --> 1105.52
and not towards making the world

1104.16 --> 1107.1200000000001
christian

1105.52 --> 1110.6399999999999
no towards

1107.12 --> 1115.4799999999998
con taking control over people

1110.64 --> 1115.48
under the false guise of christianity

1123.679 --> 1128.16
and sometimes i also wonder

1127.28 --> 1129.2
like

1128.16 --> 1131.679
jesus

1129.2 --> 1134.24
and others definitely predicted to like

1131.679 --> 1137.039
the apocalypse

1134.24 --> 1139.1200000000001
that this would happen like the church

1137.039 --> 1140.08
of the antichrist right

1139.12 --> 1142.08
but

1140.08 --> 1145.12
did anybody ever realize that that

1142.08 --> 1147.039
pretty much happened

1145.12 --> 1149.1999999999998
immediately

1147.039 --> 1152.559
after he died

1149.2 --> 1152.559
anybody ever considered that

1154.24 --> 1159.039
right and it's these are patterns so

1156.24 --> 1161.28
that was just the initial

1159.039 --> 1161.28
run

1162.08 --> 1166.32
it reinvents itself all the time first

1164.88 --> 1168.24
it was

1166.32 --> 1170.08
fake

1168.24 --> 1171.6
hollowed out christianity and mind

1170.08 --> 1175.12
control

1171.6 --> 1175.9189999999999
theocracy and then

1175.12 --> 1178.9599999999998
then

1175.919 --> 1180.7990000000002
they abandoned the old ways oh now

1178.96 --> 1184.16
they're gonna spread slanderous rumor

1180.799 --> 1184.16
about god not existing

1184.24 --> 1191.52
and that christian is just so archaic oh

1187.919 --> 1191.5200000000002
oh of evolution now

1191.679 --> 1196.64
and then

1193.6 --> 1199.12
they the ones that originally built that

1196.64 --> 1200.24
literally you know it is historically

1199.12 --> 1203.12
them

1200.24 --> 1206.72
they bring forth the new

1203.12 --> 1208.7199999999998
mind control religion

1206.72 --> 1211.28
modern atheism

1208.72 --> 1213.2
and evolution theory

1211.28 --> 1216.2
and full-blown

1213.2 --> 1216.2
heliocentrism

1220.96 --> 1225.1200000000001
and this is just very clear-cut in my

1223.28 --> 1228.8799999999999
mind now

1225.12 --> 1231.9189999999999
i always knew it was there now i know

1228.88 --> 1231.919
how it all fits

1232.08 --> 1237.1999999999998
not just a

1233.52 --> 1239.44
pattern i i can see how it fits now

1237.2 --> 1244.2
in how everything has grown

1239.44 --> 1244.2
in the last couple of thousand years

1247.91 --> 1251.039
[Music]

1249.6 --> 1253.9189999999999
it's very simple good servant

1251.039 --> 1253.919
pacification

1255.79 --> 1260.489
[Music]

1261.84 --> 1266.1589999999999
it's pacification that's what it is

1266.64 --> 1271.6000000000001
all you have to do is be part of this

1269.039 --> 1274.4
this part of this political power

1271.6 --> 1276.6399999999999
structure based on a very specific spell

1274.4 --> 1278.5590000000002
condition

1276.64 --> 1280.0
and then you're safe

1278.559 --> 1282.32
you're saved

1280.0 --> 1286.28
in a mythical way

1282.32 --> 1286.28
yeah it's called mind control

1290.88 --> 1294.7990000000002
if i listen to e michael jones yes yes

1292.88 --> 1297.7600000000002
yes dusty writer

1294.799 --> 1297.76
i know he's out there

1303.28 --> 1307.76
you see

1304.559 --> 1311.2
i have my own interpretation

1307.76 --> 1311.2
of ascension and what

1311.28 --> 1314.72
what it all really means my own

1312.799 --> 1316.48
christianity eclectic

1314.72 --> 1320.159
and i think that

1316.48 --> 1322.72
any person in any part

1320.159 --> 1325.0390000000002
to any level religious even part of a

1322.72 --> 1327.84
power structure

1325.039 --> 1330.08
it's all about them realizing this

1327.84 --> 1331.9189999999999
realization that i've gone through

1330.08 --> 1336.48
and they can do great things they can

1331.919 --> 1338.72
even like repair and stabilize with

1336.48 --> 1339.919
the original false structures of the

1338.72 --> 1342.799
religion

1339.919 --> 1344.88
and be good christians within it even

1342.799 --> 1346.72
though they're basically within the

1344.88 --> 1347.679
beast framework

1346.72 --> 1349.84
right

1347.679 --> 1351.52
but much of the beast framework is also

1349.84 --> 1353.28
filled with people that think they're

1351.52 --> 1354.799
doing the right thing

1353.28 --> 1357.28
right just as

1354.799 --> 1360.799
i when i was young i thought that being

1357.28 --> 1363.36
a liberal was the right thing it was the

1360.799 --> 1363.36
good group

1364.64 --> 1369.159
that's what i thought it's the same

1366.159 --> 1369.159
thing

1374.08 --> 1379.28
right but if you don't know that

1376.72 --> 1383.039
that it's wrong and what what the system

1379.28 --> 1385.2
you think is good is actually doing

1383.039 --> 1387.44
then you're just kind of like dwelling

1385.2 --> 1389.3600000000001
within it you don't know any better

1387.44 --> 1391.44
you think you're doing the right thing

1389.36 --> 1393.4399999999998
if you realize what's really going on

1391.44 --> 1395.1200000000001
and then you stand behind your own

1393.44 --> 1397.2
principles

1395.12 --> 1399.36
the things from your original

1397.2 --> 1400.799
inspiration and then

1399.36 --> 1403.039
follow up on them

1400.799 --> 1404.8799999999999
harden them within you follow that

1403.039 --> 1407.28
method follow that path

1404.88 --> 1410.4
then you can do good even

1407.28 --> 1410.3999999999999
within a position

1411.039 --> 1416.4
but on the long run you're probably

1413.679 --> 1418.64
gonna get worked out of it or you have

1416.4 --> 1420.0
to completely separate with other people

1418.64 --> 1423.2
that

1420.0 --> 1424.72
really like what you're doing

1423.2 --> 1425.919
and then completely do your own thing

1424.72 --> 1426.83
that happens

1425.919 --> 1428.0
it does happen

1426.83 --> 1429.6789999999999
[Music]

1428.0 --> 1431.12
a lot more people now are just kind of

1429.679 --> 1435.039
doing their own thing

1431.12 --> 1435.039
it's much more decentralized now

1435.12 --> 1438.0
everybody's doing

1444.26 --> 1447.41
[Music]

1448.64 --> 1454.0800000000002
my source for a new doctrine what

1451.52 --> 1454.08
doctrine

1455.76 --> 1459.84
my doctrine are jesus's words

1467.039 --> 1471.44
and their context right and that is up

1469.6 --> 1472.48
to the spirit that's up to the conscious

1471.44 --> 1477.3600000000001
individual

1472.48 --> 1477.3600000000001
to figure out what the context really is

1479.52 --> 1484.96
i said jesus did not no he

1483.12 --> 1487.279
said that

1484.96 --> 1490.4
good servant don't

1487.279 --> 1490.4
strawman me

1490.64 --> 1493.679
fundy

1492.64 --> 1495.5200000000002
he

1493.679 --> 1499.6000000000001
didn't say he died

1495.52 --> 1501.9189999999999
don't don't put that in my mouth

1499.6 --> 1505.12
i know i've said it but i haven't said

1501.919 --> 1505.1200000000001
it today though

1506.559 --> 1511.52
yeah he was raised from the dead but he

1508.32 --> 1513.6
didn't say he died

1511.52 --> 1514.4
and being raised from the dead is not

1513.6 --> 1515.1999999999998
exactly

1514.4 --> 1518.24
a

1515.2 --> 1520.159
commonly referred to process

1518.24 --> 1523.919
where it's very straightforward what's

1520.159 --> 1526.0800000000002
going on now is it good servant

1523.919 --> 1526.8400000000001
this is something that happens every day

1526.08 --> 1529.279
you

1526.84 --> 1531.039
know no

1529.279 --> 1532.799
so

1531.039 --> 1535.12
he didn't say he died

1532.799 --> 1537.0
and you need to get over that and also

1535.12 --> 1539.9189999999999
realize that he very

1537.0 --> 1542.799
specifically didn't say it

1539.919 --> 1544.0800000000002
because it was inquired oh yes was it

1542.799 --> 1546.96
inquired

1544.08 --> 1548.48
so there's a very distinct reason he

1546.96 --> 1551.2
didn't say it

1548.48 --> 1556.279
has to be otherwise there's no sense in

1551.2 --> 1556.279
him avoiding it after so much inquiry

1556.559 --> 1562.48
oh really is it the necessary antecedent

1559.279 --> 1564.88
to raising from the dead is it

1562.48 --> 1567.76
how do you know

1564.88 --> 1570.4
i i didn't know you knew about raising

1567.76 --> 1572.24
from the dead lore good servant

1570.4 --> 1576.5590000000002
have you practiced it have you done any

1572.24 --> 1579.76
experiments to claim an antecedent

1576.559 --> 1583.96
i mean conceptually yeah yeah

1579.76 --> 1583.96
we're talking about real things

1584.08 --> 1586.32
right

1590.4 --> 1593.44
you know when i

1593.52 --> 1597.679
broke away

1595.2 --> 1600.4
from the darkness

1597.679 --> 1603.039
roughly 20 years ago

1600.4 --> 1604.24
like really broke away like snapped out

1603.039 --> 1607.76
of the

1604.24 --> 1609.1200000000001
i want to control the beast craziness

1607.76 --> 1612.32
because that's kind of what i wanted to

1609.12 --> 1614.8799999999999
do and i completely oblivious to that it

1612.32 --> 1616.96
actually controlled me yeah

1614.88 --> 1620.159
you know how i felt

1616.96 --> 1622.32
i felt like i was raised from the dead

1620.159 --> 1623.5200000000002
i'm gonna play around a little with that

1622.32 --> 1625.6789999999999
because

1623.52 --> 1627.9189999999999
in dungeon dragons when you get raised

1625.679 --> 1629.6000000000001
from the dead which is a spell priest

1627.919 --> 1630.5590000000002
spell so there it's actually quite

1629.6 --> 1633.52
common

1630.559 --> 1635.84
don't take too serious right

1633.52 --> 1636.8799999999999
you you get resurrected with one hit

1635.84 --> 1640.9599999999998
point

1636.88 --> 1641.8400000000001
that's kind of what i felt like

1640.96 --> 1644.159
felt

1641.84 --> 1646.08
i was raised from the dead i wasn't

1644.159 --> 1649.919
really alive but i was raised from the

1646.08 --> 1652.72
dead but it was super weak i was so

1649.919 --> 1652.72
burned out

1653.039 --> 1659.44
by the avoidance of that realization

1656.48 --> 1661.1200000000001
the spell had burned me out

1659.44 --> 1664.1200000000001
and it felt like i was raised from the

1661.12 --> 1664.12
dead

1668.559 --> 1672.399
ooh oh that's interesting by the way

1670.88 --> 1677.1200000000001
good servant because

1672.399 --> 1677.12
there's another i have actual examples

1677.679 --> 1682.159
where such things are described and walk

1680.159 --> 1684.159
through whoa it's by the way pretty epic

1682.159 --> 1687.2
if he did that

1684.159 --> 1690.0800000000002
it could also mean

1687.2 --> 1693.76
he was a ghost

1690.08 --> 1696.6399999999999
i've seen ghosts do that

1693.76 --> 1700.24
and i'm talking about actual my own

1696.64 --> 1700.24
personal eyes experience

1701.279 --> 1705.44
it funnily enough

1702.799 --> 1707.679
it is like almost commonly used that's

1705.44 --> 1710.3990000000001
it's like ghost lore

1707.679 --> 1712.48
even in movies

1710.399 --> 1715.84
yeah

1712.48 --> 1717.919
so that doesn't support

1715.84 --> 1721.36
that he was resurrected it it would

1717.919 --> 1725.72
support however that he actually did die

1721.36 --> 1725.7199999999998
that's ironic about it

1726.72 --> 1731.1200000000001
right

1728.24 --> 1733.36
because that's an antecedent ghost

1731.12 --> 1735.12
antecedent is death

1733.36 --> 1737.279
and that is like

1735.12 --> 1740.2399999999998
pretty empirical

1737.279 --> 1742.399
it's not exactly natural sciences you

1740.24 --> 1743.919
know considering ghosts

1742.399 --> 1745.279
but yeah

1743.919 --> 1747.1200000000001
from all the

1745.279 --> 1750.559
experiences that's definitely a

1747.12 --> 1752.1589999999999
conclusion that most people would have

1750.559 --> 1753.44
that the sighting of a ghost would

1752.159 --> 1756.3200000000002
definitely

1753.44 --> 1758.48
mean there is a person dead

1756.32 --> 1760.8799999999999
or was dead could be very long ago you

1758.48 --> 1760.88
don't know

1761.12 --> 1766.6
he also raised lazarus from the yeah

1762.96 --> 1766.6000000000001
yeah so i've heard

1772.159 --> 1777.6000000000001
my entire point is you're believing in a

1775.36 --> 1782.9599999999998
illogical chant

1777.6 --> 1786.7199999999998
and jesus of like blatantly avoided

1782.96 --> 1786.72
saying the words

1788.24 --> 1793.6
you like to talk in parables which is

1790.48 --> 1794.88
very convenient if you don't want to get

1793.6 --> 1796.7199999999998
literal

1794.88 --> 1799.44
because

1796.72 --> 1802.0
you know that if you say something and

1799.44 --> 1804.24
you're like in that higher position so

1802.0 --> 1805.12
close to the lord as jesus absolutely

1804.24 --> 1808.48
was

1805.12 --> 1811.12
that saying it is extremely damaging if

1808.48 --> 1814.3990000000001
it's not gonna happen if you lie in the

1811.12 --> 1815.6789999999999
face of the lord that's a problem

1814.399 --> 1817.9189999999999
right

1815.679 --> 1819.8400000000001
so if he had foreknowledge

1817.919 --> 1821.6000000000001
and he would have said i died and then

1819.84 --> 1823.52
wouldn't then he'd have a problem or

1821.6 --> 1825.52
maybe he would guarantee that he would

1823.52 --> 1828.0
actually die you know this is called

1825.52 --> 1830.6399999999999
very complex high tension spiritual

1828.0 --> 1833.679
stuff here

1830.64 --> 1833.679
i almost feel

1834.0 --> 1837.84
like you shouldn't even be talking about

1835.44 --> 1837.8400000000001
that

1839.279 --> 1844.0
so yeah there's a reason he didn't

1842.0 --> 1845.44
literally say it

1844.0 --> 1848.88
that you can't find it in the red

1845.44 --> 1853.039
letters there's there must be a good

1848.88 --> 1855.5200000000002
reason for that you cannot deny that

1853.039 --> 1858.559
it's jesus's words if he didn't

1855.52 --> 1860.08
literally say it there must be a very

1858.559 --> 1864.6789999999999
good reason

1860.08 --> 1864.6789999999999
you cannot deny this

1878.24 --> 1884.24
yeah for a reason

1880.72 --> 1884.24
yeah i explained that reason

1888.88 --> 1892.3200000000002
but

1889.679 --> 1893.919
jesus sometimes when it was really in

1892.32 --> 1896.96
the moment

1893.919 --> 1900.88
but still very true he would say things

1896.96 --> 1903.039
literally he would just say it boom

1900.88 --> 1906.96
right

1903.039 --> 1909.2
don't get upset i'm not upset

1906.96 --> 1911.279
well i'm a little upset because i'm very

1909.2 --> 1914.3990000000001
annoyed by good servant

1911.279 --> 1917.76
still doing this like now truly

1914.399 --> 1919.12
revealing himself to be a complete

1917.76 --> 1921.12
zealot

1919.12 --> 1922.7199999999998
that doesn't listen

1921.12 --> 1924.08
just like the ballers and i'm

1922.72 --> 1925.039
embarrassed

1924.08 --> 1928.08
for it

1925.039 --> 1930.24
although i did i should know

1928.08 --> 1935.84
cause he was very

1930.24 --> 1935.84
upfront about that from early stage on

1940.799 --> 1946.12
yeah flatter signs because they don't

1942.559 --> 1946.12
know what they do

1949.44 --> 1952.0
that's why

1953.6 --> 1958.9599999999998
because that whole thing in my personal

1956.64 --> 1960.7990000000002
researched opinion is a mockery of

1958.96 --> 1964.32
jesus's teachings

1960.799 --> 1966.72
to parade him around like an execution

1964.32 --> 1966.72
victim

1969.12 --> 1974.6399999999999
and then claim that a human sacrifice

1972.08 --> 1977.36
would change the world is

1974.64 --> 1978.48
i cannot think of something more satanic

1977.36 --> 1982.0
than that

1978.48 --> 1982.0
cannot think of a single thing

1989.039 --> 1993.84
ah

1991.679 --> 1996.72
symbol of the cross proceeded cr that

1993.84 --> 1998.0
could be seeking star wars

1996.72 --> 2000.3990000000001
you know i'm not

1998.0 --> 2003.36
even claiming

2000.399 --> 2006.08
absolute reality concerning the thing i

2003.36 --> 2007.039
am actually a believer

2006.08 --> 2007.84
right

2007.039 --> 2012.1589999999999
i'm

2007.84 --> 2015.039
going by the story by the bible story

2012.159 --> 2017.1200000000001
and i know it's probably

2015.039 --> 2018.96
crafted

2017.12 --> 2022.1589999999999
the thing is

2018.96 --> 2024.24
there is something about jesus's words i

2022.159 --> 2026.3200000000002
think like

2024.24 --> 2030.559
they had to almost like

2026.32 --> 2030.559
sometimes i think that don't

2030.96 --> 2037.919
that the bible

2033.679 --> 2042.279
is like a giant movie script

2037.919 --> 2042.279
based on a real situation

2042.799 --> 2048.56
right that jesus's words were absolutely

2045.44 --> 2050.48
real but that it was actually somebody

2048.56 --> 2054.0789999999997
else and then they made this story and

2050.48 --> 2056.639
because jesus's words are exactly

2054.079 --> 2056.639
correct

2056.8 --> 2060.8790000000004
and on the

2058.399 --> 2063.1189999999997
made even by somebody that

2060.879 --> 2065.919
like did get it

2063.119 --> 2068.7200000000003
maybe jesus himself did it i don't know

2065.919 --> 2070.56
man i don't know

2068.72 --> 2072.0789999999997
i just know that the words are

2070.56 --> 2074.639
trustworthy and the meaning is

2072.079 --> 2076.48
existential fractal

2074.639 --> 2078.8
so i think sometimes that the entire

2076.48 --> 2080.079
bible is a crafted

2078.8 --> 2082.639
play

2080.079 --> 2085.2000000000003
of the individual that existed in

2082.639 --> 2087.52
another form before that

2085.2 --> 2090.24
i have no

2087.52 --> 2092.399
direct leads but other people are

2090.24 --> 2094.56
suggesting like

2092.399 --> 2096.399
things they've read that would suggest

2094.56 --> 2099.359
such a thing

2096.399 --> 2103.2799999999997
but i am believing it right

2099.359 --> 2105.68
god i am i'm taking it for granted

2103.28 --> 2108.1600000000003
i am saying the bible

2105.68 --> 2110.3199999999997
i am

2108.16 --> 2113.2799999999997
making that story

2110.32 --> 2115.599
my reality in a way even though i have

2113.28 --> 2117.92
kind of insights that it might be almost

2115.599 --> 2121.3590000000004
like a movie

2117.92 --> 2123.6800000000003
but the words the words of jesus

2121.359 --> 2126.96
so specifically highlighted

2123.68 --> 2126.96
that's the thing i trust

2128.4 --> 2132.1600000000003
and that's my eclectic way

2134.4 --> 2137.53
[Music]

2139.599 --> 2145.44
what you got to realize is that i'm

2141.52 --> 2148.24
already showing faith i'm showing faith

2145.44 --> 2150.079
by not outright discarding

2148.24 --> 2152.24
the bible

2150.079 --> 2153.52
because of the conclusions that i've

2152.24 --> 2154.64
drawn

2153.52 --> 2156.72
all right

2154.64 --> 2157.7599999999998
also in the foreknowledge that there

2156.72 --> 2160.0789999999997
will be

2157.76 --> 2162.32
a vast vast majority of people that will

2160.079 --> 2164.32
simply never be able to handle that

2162.32 --> 2167.52
insight

2164.32 --> 2169.76
they have to have that movie to reflect

2167.52 --> 2174.24
upon everybody will be able to reflect

2169.76 --> 2176.7200000000003
on that movie and it's a good movie

2174.24 --> 2178.9599999999996
very rich

2176.72 --> 2182.0789999999997
very rich in information

2178.96 --> 2182.079
any way you twist it

2182.16 --> 2187.839
and jesus is in there

2184.32 --> 2189.76
the the way the example the best of us

2187.839 --> 2193.68
so

2189.76 --> 2193.6800000000003
that's why i do what i do

2195.839 --> 2198.48
and that's why i'm not like

2197.359 --> 2201.04
jesus

2198.48 --> 2202.56
jesus is only the sun it's all just a

2201.04 --> 2206.32
reference to the celestial

2202.56 --> 2208.72
constellations and it's all nonsense

2206.32 --> 2211.6800000000003
yeah because i know it's not all

2208.72 --> 2212.9599999999996
nonsense there's much to learn just from

2211.68 --> 2215.359
the story

2212.96 --> 2217.76
and especially from jesus's words even

2215.359 --> 2220.16
though yeah

2217.76 --> 2223.28
there is a

2220.16 --> 2225.839
it's designed it's it has multiple

2223.28 --> 2229.6800000000003
angles of approach

2225.839 --> 2232.16
but it was extremely well crafted

2229.68 --> 2232.16
like that

2238.0 --> 2245.119
the cross represents creation that moves

2240.48 --> 2247.359
from the center out you know i what

2245.119 --> 2247.359
no

2248.8 --> 2252.6400000000003
no i don't think so seeking star wars

2254.32 --> 2258.56
but what it might mean is

2257.2 --> 2261.04
the center

2258.56 --> 2263.359
of earth

2261.04 --> 2265.2
right across is even like the

2263.359 --> 2268.16
symbol of earthing

2265.2 --> 2268.16
in electronics

2268.48 --> 2273.119
crossing a circle

2270.4 --> 2276.1600000000003
right also there is to be considered the

2273.119 --> 2279.04
northern cross

2276.16 --> 2279.04
also across

2281.119 --> 2286.079
right the cross might simply have been

2283.359 --> 2288.48
an original recognition

2286.079 --> 2288.48
for the

2288.72 --> 2292.56
the celestial consistency

2293.599 --> 2298.48
to know the cross would be to understand

2295.839 --> 2300.96
the sky a symbol like that it might have

2298.48 --> 2303.68
originated from that like in super

2300.96 --> 2303.68
antiquity

2303.92 --> 2308.079
like before the flood even i don't know

2306.56 --> 2309.7599999999998
right

2308.079 --> 2311.44
but

2309.76 --> 2314.6400000000003
that's where i think the cross came from

2311.44 --> 2314.64
i what you said

2316.64 --> 2319.68
hey nathan oakley

2323.92 --> 2328.88
arms are not legal

2325.52 --> 2328.88
oh that cross right

2329.599 --> 2333.3590000000004
i don't know where that cross came from

2335.599 --> 2342.56
the unequal cross

2338.64 --> 2345.359
that might be some have another origin

2342.56 --> 2347.04
but i think that that symbol is probably

2345.359 --> 2349.2
more

2347.04 --> 2352.24
recent not as old

2349.2 --> 2353.2
as the other symbol like the plus

2352.24 --> 2356.3999999999996
is

2353.2 --> 2358.8799999999997
one of the oldest symbols there is

2356.4 --> 2358.88
it is

2367.119 --> 2370.48
yeah symbology is your thing yeah so

2369.119 --> 2374.079
it's mine

2370.48 --> 2376.0
i made a site called symbolics.now

2374.079 --> 2376.96
in 2006.

2376.0 --> 2382.0
yeah

2376.96 --> 2385.28
i've done some very elaborate study

2382.0 --> 2385.28
still the writings are there

2386.48 --> 2389.92
learning secret knowledge just

2388.079 --> 2392.4
understanding what symbols are and how

2389.92 --> 2392.4
they work

2395.28 --> 2400.1600000000003
also what they do to people

2398.4 --> 2401.599
did a study to that

2400.16 --> 2402.48
2006

2401.599 --> 2406.2000000000003
that's

2402.48 --> 2406.2
15 years ago

2412.64 --> 2417.839
symbols scare people that's why

2414.56 --> 2419.839
everybody's freemason no phobic

2417.839 --> 2422.0
uh

2419.839 --> 2424.48
it's a bit of an over general asia it's

2422.0 --> 2426.24
just generalization look

2424.48 --> 2428.72
people get scared of symbols when

2426.24 --> 2430.9599999999996
they're made to be frightened of symbols

2428.72 --> 2430.9599999999996
right

2432.64 --> 2436.56
people can be made to be scared of

2434.48 --> 2439.04
everything can be made to be scared of

2436.56 --> 2441.2799999999997
cats

2439.04 --> 2443.119
they can be made to be scared of pretty

2441.28 --> 2445.44
women

2443.119 --> 2447.52
there's all kinds of people

2445.44 --> 2450.96
there's all kinds of

2447.52 --> 2452.96
times in history where people got

2450.96 --> 2454.8
like politically

2452.96 --> 2458.4
indoctrinated

2454.8 --> 2460.6400000000003
to be scared and hate certain things

2458.4 --> 2462.319
and yeah right now symbols

2460.64 --> 2463.92
why would that be could it be because

2462.319 --> 2466.16
symbols are a critical part in

2463.92 --> 2467.359
understanding communication throughout

2466.16 --> 2468.24
the ages

2467.359 --> 2470.0789999999997
yeah

2468.24 --> 2472.7999999999997
well what better way to stop that

2470.079 --> 2474.7200000000003
ascension than to basically insert a

2472.8 --> 2476.96
false

2474.72 --> 2479.04
evil meaning to dissuade you from

2476.96 --> 2481.839
engaging to get a fear response whenever

2479.04 --> 2481.839
you see that symbol

2488.0 --> 2492.88
they give you your weakness

2491.28 --> 2495.119
and you take it

2492.88 --> 2498.88
you think it's real

2495.119 --> 2501.119
and then that weakness handed to you

2498.88 --> 2504.96
is going to alter

2501.119 --> 2504.96
the choices you make as you go

2506.48 --> 2509.839
that's what it's designed to do

2518.4 --> 2523.119
how long do you think it will take for

2520.88 --> 2525.92
you to answer all the these questions

2523.119 --> 2529.76
about christianity

2525.92 --> 2529.76
before you can move on with life

2530.24 --> 2534.319
a devotional life as a christian

2534.56 --> 2537.56
what

2538.72 --> 2541.359
what do you mean

2548.319 --> 2551.72
i don't understand

2554.88 --> 2560.2400000000002
why would answering questions about

2558.0 --> 2561.76
christianity

2560.24 --> 2562.8799999999997
hinder me

2561.76 --> 2565.3590000000004
from

2562.88 --> 2568.599
devoting my life as a christian i don't

2565.359 --> 2568.5989999999997
get it

2589.2 --> 2593.24
hello natura wallace

2639.52 --> 2642.52
hmm

2653.68 --> 2659.04
okay so no response to that you ask me a

2656.24 --> 2660.8799999999997
question and then

2659.04 --> 2662.48
when i inquire about that question

2660.88 --> 2664.56
you're not going to answer me aries

2662.48 --> 2667.359
cursor man that's

2664.56 --> 2667.359
disappointing

2671.92 --> 2676.119
it's a rhetorical question

2677.28 --> 2681.52
the but it's a contradicting question

2679.359 --> 2683.2799999999997
like the one doesn't prevent the other i

2681.52 --> 2684.079
don't understand

2683.28 --> 2685.44
it

2684.079 --> 2686.48
it's a false

2685.44 --> 2689.8
setup

2686.48 --> 2689.8
false dichotomy

2709.76 --> 2714.4
a spirit-filled life needs no formal

2712.16 --> 2717.64
religion right you just need to follow

2714.4 --> 2717.64
the principles

2737.839 --> 2742.24
you don't need all the answers right

2739.68 --> 2744.72
just enough to get your well i'd

2742.24 --> 2746.7999999999997
rephrase that dusty writer i say you

2744.72 --> 2750.48
don't need to get all the answers just

2746.8 --> 2750.48
enough to understand

2752.079 --> 2755.04
right to know

2756.0 --> 2763.119
right to get a bigger picture you don't

2758.88 --> 2763.119
need every micro detail

2763.44 --> 2766.8
unless it's really critical for some

2765.52 --> 2768.4
reason

2766.8 --> 2770.1600000000003
for your own curiosity for your own

2768.4 --> 2772.64
perfection needs

2770.16 --> 2774.8799999999997
you just need enough to understand right

2772.64 --> 2777.7599999999998
but it's very hard to judge when that is

2774.88 --> 2777.76
especially when

2778.319 --> 2783.7599999999998
certain teachings are obviously

2781.119 --> 2786.2400000000002
right in the hands for over a thousand

2783.76 --> 2789.0400000000004
years of people that are

2786.24 --> 2791.4399999999996
there specifically

2789.04 --> 2794.56
to give you a misunderstanding about

2791.44 --> 2798.68
them and they don't even know it

2794.56 --> 2798.68
or most of them won't

2818.4 --> 2821.4
right

2844.319 --> 2848.24
all right also clearly i kind of resent

2846.48 --> 2850.559
that statement

2848.24 --> 2853.1189999999997
the christians stole

2850.559 --> 2856.0
the greek logo symbol

2853.119 --> 2856.0
did they steal it

2857.599 --> 2861.839
or was it

2858.96 --> 2864.2400000000002
like it could be different ways right

2861.839 --> 2868.0
maybe they had no they probably didn't

2864.24 --> 2868.0
wear any crosses or anything

2868.48 --> 2871.2
before

2869.839 --> 2873.359
jesus

2871.2 --> 2875.68
yeah you know

2873.359 --> 2876.72
before all that happened

2875.68 --> 2879.359
so

2876.72 --> 2882.64
i rather think that it the the symbol

2879.359 --> 2886.0789999999997
was probably forced on them by the

2882.64 --> 2888.48
by the catholic church

2886.079 --> 2890.7200000000003
an identifier or rather like oh

2888.48 --> 2893.2
you're a priest you have to wear this to

2890.72 --> 2895.5989999999997
represent that

2893.2 --> 2897.839
and first it's like a theocra theocratic

2895.599 --> 2899.119
monopoly it's like you will have to be a

2897.839 --> 2900.96
priest or you're not allowed to wear

2899.119 --> 2902.88
that and then later

2900.96 --> 2904.7200000000003
it would be associated like oh but i

2902.88 --> 2906.079
want to be a priest too because they

2904.72 --> 2909.2
have power

2906.079 --> 2910.48
and they seem they are assigned to know

2909.2 --> 2914.48
all these things

2910.48 --> 2916.319
i want that too and then at some point

2914.48 --> 2919.119
people would just like start to wear

2916.319 --> 2919.119
their own crosses

2920.96 --> 2926.319
i don't think that the actual first

2923.28 --> 2928.8
christians would ever like was like oh

2926.319 --> 2931.839
jesus has been crucified

2928.8 --> 2934.7200000000003
let's all put a cross around our neck

2931.839 --> 2936.24
maybe i'm wrong though did they

2934.72 --> 2938.16
i don't think so i don't remember

2936.24 --> 2941.8799999999997
anything like that

2938.16 --> 2941.8799999999997
from bible references

2949.68 --> 2952.5589999999997
that seems just

2954.96 --> 2959.28
okay starting 80 12.

2957.68 --> 2962.319
yeah i'm doing fine

2959.28 --> 2962.3190000000004
it's kind of nice weather

2963.04 --> 2966.44
pretty sunday

2981.76 --> 2985.3190000000004
during the ring

2990.72 --> 2993.4399999999996
yeah clutch

2996.079 --> 3003.44
well you know in all fairness clutch

3000.48 --> 3003.44
i do think that

3003.68 --> 3010.48
jesus wouldn't mind if he'd return

3007.28 --> 3012.7200000000003
having lived forever in my opinion if he

3010.48 --> 3016.0
ever returned from heaven

3012.72 --> 3018.16
in his physical incarnation

3016.0 --> 3020.0
and you would present the cross like oh

3018.16 --> 3022.16
look jesus he wouldn't mind that

3020.0 --> 3024.48
although he'd be annoyed by it

3022.16 --> 3025.52
but you would never know

3024.48 --> 3027.68
like that's

3025.52 --> 3030.48
yeah annoyed is a big word

3027.68 --> 3032.319
you wouldn't think like oh yeah

3030.48 --> 3033.52
there's that cross again

3032.319 --> 3034.4
no

3033.52 --> 3037.119
but

3034.4 --> 3038.64
he'd be more interested in like how well

3037.119 --> 3040.96
they actually

3038.64 --> 3043.92
understood his teachings i think that

3040.96 --> 3045.2
would be a much higher priority

3043.92 --> 3046.96
for jesus

3045.2 --> 3048.7999999999997
to pay attention to

3046.96 --> 3051.119
and not like whether somebody is wearing

3048.8 --> 3053.44
the right symbol around their neck

3051.119 --> 3054.88
and even worse if they'd wear sid that

3053.44 --> 3056.4
symbol and then

3054.88 --> 3057.76
completely

3056.4 --> 3059.76
didn't get it

3057.76 --> 3063.76
didn't get any of christ's teachings and

3059.76 --> 3066.6400000000003
we're just like oh yeah oh we forced

3063.76 --> 3068.88
everybody in our country to now like you

3066.64 --> 3071.1189999999997
have to do that chant or you get

3068.88 --> 3073.28
executed you think christ gonna be happy

3071.119 --> 3074.319
about that when he returns

3073.28 --> 3076.2400000000002
no

3074.319 --> 3077.68
no he won't he will be

3076.24 --> 3079.4399999999996
horrified

3077.68 --> 3080.96
he'd probably

3079.44 --> 3084.0
wipe them out

3080.96 --> 3088.119
if if you told them that

3084.0 --> 3088.119
yeah that's what i predict

3094.25 --> 3097.44
[Music]

3101.56 --> 3105.69
[Music]

3128.24 --> 3132.5589999999997
right okay seeking star wars so you're

3130.64 --> 3135.839
saying that

3132.559 --> 3135.8390000000004
the cross did come later

3136.72 --> 3140.48
like that there's a historical

3138.559 --> 3143.44
significance

3140.48 --> 3146.0
or a historically recorded moment where

3143.44 --> 3148.2400000000002
that started to pop up

3146.0 --> 3149.359
okay well that supports my

3148.24 --> 3152.4799999999996
theory then

3149.359 --> 3154.7999999999997
that the cross was rather forced on

3152.48 --> 3157.44
christianity

3154.8 --> 3159.76
and not like

3157.44 --> 3162.88
that not like the original apostles came

3159.76 --> 3166.3590000000004
up with that doing that

3162.88 --> 3166.359
that makes sense

3166.4 --> 3169.839
hello mystical

3174.4 --> 3180.319
i wonder when christ will return maybe

3176.64 --> 3182.0789999999997
he has who no no if he returned we know

3180.319 --> 3184.24
we would know

3182.079 --> 3187.92
the world would not be the same

3184.24 --> 3187.9199999999996
the setting would not be the same

3188.72 --> 3193.359
we'd know it's like you could almost

3191.52 --> 3194.559
like this is what i think

3193.359 --> 3196.96
maybe

3194.559 --> 3199.3590000000004
it's real maybe not it's like kind of

3196.96 --> 3201.28
what how i experienced in my vision

3199.359 --> 3203.5989999999997
like when he returns

3201.28 --> 3205.92
is when the world just like when

3203.599 --> 3209.04
everything changes and not just like oh

3205.92 --> 3211.6800000000003
look it's organized differently or oh no

3209.04 --> 3211.68
it's just like

3213.04 --> 3217.839
like a complete

3214.96 --> 3219.76
alteration of just the framework of

3217.839 --> 3221.2
everything

3219.76 --> 3222.96
like suddenly

3221.2 --> 3225.1189999999997
the energies might be completely

3222.96 --> 3227.119
different who knows maybe it's an agent

3225.119 --> 3229.6800000000003
in which like a lot of typical

3227.119 --> 3233.359
restrictions

3229.68 --> 3235.7599999999998
of of the matrix system of this specific

3233.359 --> 3239.2799999999997
setting are just subtly lifted because

3235.76 --> 3242.079
christ returns and they cannot go inside

3239.28 --> 3244.4
so if like you wake up one day and

3242.079 --> 3246.6400000000003
everything looks different

3244.4 --> 3248.4
and feels different

3246.64 --> 3251.359
yeah that might be a good chance that

3248.4 --> 3255.04
christ just returned to the world

3251.359 --> 3255.04
that's my suspicion

3255.44 --> 3259.2000000000003
like if he returned you know

3259.52 --> 3264.4
if you have half a lake a sense in you

3261.92 --> 3266.88
it requires your senses to notice the

3264.4 --> 3266.88
difference

3275.52 --> 3279.2
agree with you it won't be a case of he

3278.319 --> 3281.44
has

3279.2 --> 3282.3999999999996
and nobody believes no absolutely it

3281.44 --> 3283.599
won't

3282.4 --> 3286.4
but

3283.599 --> 3288.319
there might still be those that despite

3286.4 --> 3291.52
the alteration

3288.319 --> 3293.68
the obvious change of the world setting

3291.52 --> 3296.16
that despite that will still be devil

3293.68 --> 3298.8799999999997
bomb that will deny it anyway that will

3296.16 --> 3300.8799999999997
literally deny their own senses to

3298.88 --> 3303.839
continue their

3300.88 --> 3306.319
demonic grasp

3303.839 --> 3309.359
on the matrix they want control they

3306.319 --> 3311.599
want to rule so they will try to deny

3309.359 --> 3313.92
him

3311.599 --> 3316.2400000000002
right and then it's yeah we'll see what

3313.92 --> 3316.2400000000002
happens

3318.839 --> 3324.319
then so it's not like everybody will

3322.0 --> 3326.24
just immediately like be like oh yeah of

3324.319 --> 3327.68
course chris no no they're still

3326.24 --> 3330.72
freaking

3327.68 --> 3331.68
crazy people and satanists like that are

3330.72 --> 3334.24
really

3331.68 --> 3336.319
like doubling down forever that

3334.24 --> 3337.7599999999998
literally pray to go

3336.319 --> 3340.48
to to

3337.76 --> 3342.6400000000003
perdition crazy [ __ ] like do you think

3340.48 --> 3344.16
they're just gonna

3342.64 --> 3348.0789999999997
worship christ all of a sudden when he

3344.16 --> 3351.839
returns no no no no

3348.079 --> 3351.8390000000004
no there will be resistance

3353.599 --> 3358.1600000000003
but i don't think there will be a

3354.88 --> 3358.1600000000003
resistance for very long

3358.96 --> 3363.4
you mean like globals no no no

3364.72 --> 3368.5589999999997
i don't think

3366.319 --> 3368.5589999999997
like

3370.4 --> 3374.839
i'm not excluding globers but it's not

3372.799 --> 3377.68
like oh you believe in the globe so

3374.839 --> 3380.0
therefore you're willing to literally

3377.68 --> 3382.48
defy the return of

3380.0 --> 3385.2
well what might be the creator or the

3382.48 --> 3386.559
most directed appointed one

3385.2 --> 3388.8799999999997
uh

3386.559 --> 3392.96
i don't think clobbers are gonna like

3388.88 --> 3394.88
literally go to hell for their globe

3392.96 --> 3396.48
when they feel it

3394.88 --> 3399.359
i don't know but maybe some of them are

3396.48 --> 3401.839
so crazy that they would

3399.359 --> 3401.839
i don't know

3403.599 --> 3409.28
the anti-flat earthers maybe maybe maybe

3406.64 --> 3411.92
they would or maybe they just like

3409.28 --> 3413.8390000000004
retreat in absolute shame

3411.92 --> 3416.0
and just try to avoid

3413.839 --> 3419.359
human society from that point on i don't

3416.0 --> 3424.16
know man i don't know it all depends on

3419.359 --> 3424.16
if it returns how everything changes

3424.48 --> 3430.4
right if feelings if what you're used to

3427.92 --> 3432.2400000000002
like the normal flow of your experience

3430.4 --> 3433.599
in your feelings like even like organ

3432.24 --> 3436.4799999999996
centuries right

3433.599 --> 3439.599
if that all suddenly shifted somehow

3436.48 --> 3442.799
like you literally don't even recognize

3439.599 --> 3444.96
your own bodily feelings anymore

3442.799 --> 3447.839
you can't predict how that would change

3444.96 --> 3450.7200000000003
everything you see

3447.839 --> 3453.119
because we anchor ourselves

3450.72 --> 3455.2
in the experience and how we reflect

3453.119 --> 3458.4
things so if everything changes then we

3455.2 --> 3459.2
don't know how we will change

3458.4 --> 3461.28
it's

3459.2 --> 3464.16
i cannot predict it

3461.28 --> 3468.4
you could guess it but that all depends

3464.16 --> 3472.0
on how everything changes again so

3468.4 --> 3475.0
i just know that everything will change

3472.0 --> 3475.0
anyway

3481.68 --> 3488.68
everything then why you global because

3483.68 --> 3488.68
he's just holding on that's his faith

3489.44 --> 3494.96
he thinks that god can twist the entire

3492.48 --> 3496.88
reality inside out in order to

3494.96 --> 3498.319
accomplish that belief that's what he

3496.88 --> 3500.48
thinks

3498.319 --> 3503.839
that's called magical thinking i used to

3500.48 --> 3503.839
do that myself

3504.16 --> 3508.3999999999996
like no god is there

3506.079 --> 3510.799
no in a way that everything seems to

3508.4 --> 3513.599
point at that the globe is wrong yet

3510.799 --> 3515.599
still believe god could make it real for

3513.599 --> 3517.119
them you see

3515.599 --> 3519.2000000000003
and maybe

3517.119 --> 3521.92
maybe in heaven

3519.2 --> 3524.3999999999996
maybe in heaven it can be real

3521.92 --> 3526.559
it could be a giant sci-fi

3524.4 --> 3531.319
space experience

3526.559 --> 3531.3190000000004
you know i cannot exclude that

3539.92 --> 3543.88
globe is r-rated

3552.96 --> 3558.839
because it only exists in your local

3554.96 --> 3558.839
cinema that's genius

3561.119 --> 3566.52
and ironic

3562.559 --> 3566.52
because it has no r

3580.88 --> 3584.799
that's so weird

3583.2 --> 3587.839
r rated

3584.799 --> 3587.839
globe no r

3588.16 --> 3592.0
yeah it's a pretty good one tony

3589.599 --> 3592.0
whitcomb

3606.079 --> 3609.119
no argument

3609.2 --> 3612.5589999999997
oh didn't anybody pick up on my title

3611.2 --> 3615.839
yet

3612.559 --> 3615.8390000000004
it's got another puzzle

3629.76 --> 3634.48
it's a play on words on the problem

3632.319 --> 3635.7599999999998
reaction solution

3634.48 --> 3638.559
right

3635.76 --> 3638.559
which is the

3638.88 --> 3642.559
the

3640.079 --> 3644.4
not necessarily spiritual

3642.559 --> 3646.7200000000003
not it isn't it's anti-spiritual it's

3644.4 --> 3646.7200000000003
like the

3647.28 --> 3652.96
the method of choice for the dark forces

3650.72 --> 3656.16
right problem reaction solution it's one

3652.96 --> 3660.2400000000002
of the most well-known methods tools for

3656.16 --> 3663.2799999999997
the dark one for the dark ones

3660.24 --> 3664.5589999999997
like how to turn lead into gold

3663.28 --> 3668.4
through war

3664.559 --> 3671.44
and then you plunder your target

3668.4 --> 3674.319
and there's the gold right well

3671.44 --> 3674.319
the ballers

3675.76 --> 3680.079
they would love to follow the problem

3678.24 --> 3682.5589999999997
reaction solution

3680.079 --> 3683.76
situation concerning the struggle they

3682.559 --> 3685.599
have to

3683.76 --> 3687.76
reinforce their faith

3685.599 --> 3691.04
in the globe earth

3687.76 --> 3693.8390000000004
but they end up with problem refraction

3691.04 --> 3693.839
dissolution

3696.16 --> 3699.04
right

3697.52 --> 3701.92
because what's their problem well the

3699.04 --> 3704.319
black swan it's it is their main problem

3701.92 --> 3706.96
it is really a mechanical problem that's

3704.319 --> 3709.7599999999998
like a huge thorn in the eye

3706.96 --> 3711.68
literally in the eye ironically

3709.76 --> 3713.28
and

3711.68 --> 3715.0389999999998
like yeah

3713.28 --> 3717.52
it's right there

3715.039 --> 3720.7200000000003
they can't get rid of it so they created

3717.52 --> 3721.92
refraction that was their reaction

3720.72 --> 3724.16
right

3721.92 --> 3726.0
they thought it was going to be their

3724.16 --> 3728.3999999999996
solution

3726.0 --> 3730.799
the refraction but it ended up being

3728.4 --> 3733.92
their dissolution because it is

3730.799 --> 3737.7599999999998
paradoxical it's a dead end it's like

3733.92 --> 3740.4
an impossible to resolve argument

3737.76 --> 3742.079
it breaks everything it breaks geometric

3740.4 --> 3745.119
geometry

3742.079 --> 3746.96
it undoes the establishment of the r

3745.119 --> 3751.92
value

3746.96 --> 3753.44
thus yeah problem refraction dissolution

3751.92 --> 3757.2000000000003
this illusion

3753.44 --> 3757.2000000000003
yeah sure could be this illusion

3758.319 --> 3765.119
but this solution is like the

3761.68 --> 3765.1189999999997
self it's erasing

3765.44 --> 3769.0
i think it is

3775.92 --> 3780.559
yeah the action of formally ending or

3778.319 --> 3784.48
dismissing an assembly

3780.559 --> 3784.48
partnership or official body

3785.76 --> 3791.28
right the

3787.839 --> 3792.0
the deciding to end

3791.28 --> 3794.1600000000003
so

3792.0 --> 3796.72
this might be actually almost a

3794.16 --> 3799.5989999999997
prophetic prediction

3796.72 --> 3801.4399999999996
that's how it will proceed problem

3799.599 --> 3802.559
oh flat earth flat earth oh look the

3801.44 --> 3804.2400000000002
black swan

3802.559 --> 3806.3190000000004
refraction oh

3804.24 --> 3807.52
we never claimed to see the geometric

3806.319 --> 3808.64
horizon

3807.52 --> 3811.2
and then

3808.64 --> 3815.68
this solution like

3811.2 --> 3818.319
so much double speak they don't even

3815.68 --> 3820.72
have cohesive partnerships with each

3818.319 --> 3822.4
other eventually they'll all be so far

3820.72 --> 3825.5989999999997
drifting in their own double speak

3822.4 --> 3827.92
delusion nobody will accept or respect

3825.599 --> 3830.4
anybody else

3827.92 --> 3832.64
in their club

3830.4 --> 3834.88
and then this solution will just happen

3832.64 --> 3838.24
everybody will just drift off and almost

3834.88 --> 3840.2400000000002
try to forget it all happen dissolution

3838.24 --> 3842.799
it's my prediction might take a long

3840.24 --> 3845.2799999999997
time though

3842.799 --> 3849.2
but it also might suddenly just get

3845.28 --> 3849.2000000000003
there suddenly dissolve yep

3851.119 --> 3854.6400000000003
yes dusty right yeah dissolve

3854.799 --> 3860.88
but i used this solution because well it

3858.24 --> 3863.4399999999996
has solution in it

3860.88 --> 3866.44
it's it's just that it's the exact

3863.44 --> 3866.44
opposite

3873.359 --> 3881.0
and the funny is that refraction has

3875.599 --> 3881.0
reaction in it with an f and an r

3881.359 --> 3887.2
right this is what i do

3883.44 --> 3887.2000000000003
i choose my words carefully

3887.28 --> 3891.96
when it comes to this kind of wordplay

3896.16 --> 3901.2799999999997
yeah they're gonna melt i'm melting oh

3899.28 --> 3905.7200000000003
what a world

3901.28 --> 3905.7200000000003
all right i'll be back in two minutes

3929.2 --> 3932.2
so

4018.0 --> 4021.48
and i'm back

4034.559 --> 4037.92
hey pj crew shank

4046.799 --> 4052.0
ah all right tony whitcomb see you later

4048.96 --> 4052.0
have a nice party

4052.4 --> 4056.2000000000003
at the dress up

4080.16 --> 4083.839
yeah well sks look

4084.72 --> 4088.0
it's one thing i'll say one way to say

4087.039 --> 4090.2400000000002
it right

4088.0 --> 4092.96
oh jesus is coming back to destroy

4090.24 --> 4095.9199999999996
yourself very dramatic also you if that

4092.96 --> 4098.4800000000005
was the actual

4095.92 --> 4101.6
angle of approach for reality for that

4098.48 --> 4105.239
to happen then you don't know when

4101.6 --> 4105.2390000000005
at all

4105.44 --> 4107.44
right

4106.56 --> 4109.1990000000005
or

4107.44 --> 4112.639999999999
you could consider that

4109.199 --> 4115.44
the return of jesus would simply be

4112.64 --> 4118.159000000001
the end of this era

4115.44 --> 4119.199
so that basically the dark ones the

4118.159 --> 4122.48
demons

4119.199 --> 4123.199
get the signal like okay your contract's

4122.48 --> 4126.159
up

4123.199 --> 4128.239
your time here is now over

4126.159 --> 4130.3189999999995
settings going to change your tricks

4128.239 --> 4133.199
aren't going to work anymore so yeah

4130.319 --> 4136.2390000000005
they'll just retreat and like these dark

4133.199 --> 4137.5199999999995
spirits just leave

4136.239 --> 4139.839
a lot of them

4137.52 --> 4142.56
because yeah everything changes like

4139.839 --> 4147.839
they might even feel it coming like oh

4142.56 --> 4147.839000000001
no it's the end even before christ comes

4148.719 --> 4151.52
and then

4149.759 --> 4154.4
it'll just stop and then christ will

4151.52 --> 4154.400000000001
return i don't know

4156.0 --> 4161.199
but to say like no it has to be peak

4158.96 --> 4162.4
worse like everything has to be complete

4161.199 --> 4164.879999999999
[ __ ]

4162.4 --> 4167.839
everybody corrupted everybody

4164.88 --> 4170.400000000001
dead or corrupted

4167.839 --> 4172.5599999999995
like to the max

4170.4 --> 4175.599999999999
really when's that gonna happen i don't

4172.56 --> 4176.88
see that happening

4175.6 --> 4180.159000000001
i think we

4176.88 --> 4182.64
i think yeah the people that don't like

4180.159 --> 4185.12
the darkness would rather end up just

4182.64 --> 4186.0
like total war

4185.12 --> 4189.679
right

4186.0 --> 4191.759
nobody's going to

4189.679 --> 4194.719
there will not be a full surrender to

4191.759 --> 4197.28
evil moment they can't be

4194.719 --> 4199.52
doesn't work like that the spirit will

4197.28 --> 4202.0
refuse

4199.52 --> 4204.080000000001
like little kids will stand up and say

4202.0 --> 4207.28
[ __ ] you oh i'm gonna be a warlord and

4204.08 --> 4207.28
i'm gonna destroy you all

4208.719 --> 4213.92
and i'm not talking about

4211.76 --> 4217.52
some jungle territory or anything i'm

4213.92 --> 4220.08
talking about western civilization

4217.52 --> 4221.360000000001
right if everything is corrupted so

4220.08 --> 4224.96
badly

4221.36 --> 4224.96
then the kids will literally

4225.76 --> 4233.12
form that contrast and be like okay

4229.36 --> 4234.4
this is so [ __ ] up i'm gonna try to

4233.12 --> 4235.76
somehow

4234.4 --> 4237.12
rescue

4235.76 --> 4239.52
my people

4237.12 --> 4242.08
from this darkness

4239.52 --> 4243.679
they will come and they will start very

4242.08 --> 4246.48
young

4243.679 --> 4246.4800000000005
unbelievable

4250.159 --> 4254.879999999999
that's what i predict happens and nobody

4252.56 --> 4256.8
is making them do that they will

4254.88 --> 4258.96
literally choose

4256.8 --> 4260.64
that at a very young age and get that

4258.96 --> 4262.32
blessing

4260.64 --> 4265.280000000001
so i it

4262.32 --> 4268.4
i don't see it i don't see this

4265.28 --> 4270.8
inevitable absolute corruption of all i

4268.4 --> 4274.5599999999995
did i don't see it it can't happen the

4270.8 --> 4274.56
spirit mechanics don't allow that

4282.0 --> 4286.44
scripting is not the way

4288.64 --> 4290.88
uh

4292.64 --> 4295.84
hell only exists in the misdirected

4294.64 --> 4297.679
confections

4295.84 --> 4300.88
it's interesting dusty right that's an

4297.679 --> 4302.96
interesting philosophical statement

4300.88 --> 4305.1990000000005
yes there is def look there is the

4302.96 --> 4307.199
experience of hell and there is the

4305.199 --> 4309.678999999999
experience of heaven these are like the

4307.199 --> 4312.639999999999
inner reflections of our spirit

4309.679 --> 4315.84
might express themselves in your

4312.64 --> 4315.84
daily experience

4315.92 --> 4320.2390000000005
or your dreams

4317.92 --> 4324.2390000000005
can get very graphic and get very

4320.239 --> 4327.199
biblically graphic sometimes even

4324.239 --> 4329.199
when serious morality gets involved or

4327.199 --> 4330.32
is endangered

4329.199 --> 4333.5199999999995
so

4330.32 --> 4337.679
i believe in that hell in heaven

4333.52 --> 4339.92
because i have empirical evidence for it

4337.679 --> 4342.8
now what happens after

4339.92 --> 4344.96
life

4342.8 --> 4347.76
i basically humbly kneel before the

4344.96 --> 4350.56
creator and say i don't know

4347.76 --> 4354.04
i don't know no matter what is promised

4350.56 --> 4354.04
by any man

4358.0 --> 4361.28
like

4358.88 --> 4363.04
even jesus

4361.28 --> 4366.0
but

4363.04 --> 4369.6
because i it's something i cannot know

4366.0 --> 4373.199
i cannot know and thus i must kneel

4369.6 --> 4374.64
humbly and recognize i do not know but

4373.199 --> 4377.28
god

4374.64 --> 4380.8
creator if there is

4377.28 --> 4382.48
then i'd love to be part of heaven

4380.8 --> 4384.8
i think

4382.48 --> 4387.919999999999
i don't know i'll leave it up to god to

4384.8 --> 4390.88
judge that right i i surrender myself

4387.92 --> 4394.32
after death wherever i go maybe nothing

4390.88 --> 4397.04
maybe heaven maybe the abyss

4394.32 --> 4399.84
i can imagine being in all places like

4397.04 --> 4399.84
that

4400.0 --> 4404.48
i'm just leaving it up to god because

4404.64 --> 4408.320000000001
it's been so complicated

4409.84 --> 4414.400000000001
i'm just trying to follow the principle

4411.679 --> 4416.0
i'm just trying to kind of step into the

4414.4 --> 4418.96
shadow of jesus

4416.0 --> 4421.48
try to do it as much as i can and

4418.96 --> 4425.56
be that vigilant always be that

4421.48 --> 4425.5599999999995
inconvenient vigilance

4427.679 --> 4431.92
always being the thorn in the eye of the

4430.48 --> 4434.759999999999
lie

4431.92 --> 4438.159
right it's all about taking that

4434.76 --> 4438.159000000001
inconvenient truth

4438.56 --> 4445.04
and not stupid movie by al gore [ __ ]

4442.4 --> 4446.799999999999
this is a total gaslighting thing

4445.04 --> 4449.199
you even call it that

4446.8 --> 4451.76
total gas light is genius grappler move

4449.199 --> 4454.759999999999
by the way it's still disgusting

4451.76 --> 4454.76
but

4454.88 --> 4460.8
the real truth is always inconvenience

4459.199 --> 4463.04
it's part of the

4460.8 --> 4465.4400000000005
the thing that jesus said that in his

4463.04 --> 4468.159
parables too just

4465.44 --> 4471.199
closer you get the more everybody will

4468.159 --> 4473.839999999999
step away from you will renounce you

4471.199 --> 4476.839999999999
that's what happens it's a polarization

4473.84 --> 4476.84
effect

4490.719 --> 4494.08
that's right he is the best mentor to

4492.56 --> 4496.64
have and it

4494.08 --> 4498.4
the main problem was always and will

4496.64 --> 4502.96
forever be

4498.4 --> 4502.96
that people don't listen to him

4503.36 --> 4508.799999999999
he's like oh you think you listen to him

4505.28 --> 4508.8
have you listened more carefully

4509.04 --> 4513.76
have you listened to how i listen to him

4511.76 --> 4516.64
what do you think about that way of

4513.76 --> 4516.64
listening to him

4517.52 --> 4519.76
right

4520.159 --> 4525.44
how deep will you go in listening to

4522.88 --> 4529.12
what he actually says and how far will

4525.44 --> 4531.28
you actually put the act with the deed

4529.12 --> 4534.0
when you learn something about

4531.28 --> 4534.0
what he said

4535.12 --> 4538.84
it's a forever challenge

4570.8 --> 4574.88
what about enoch well i don't know

4577.6 --> 4583.92
i think enoch went through some very

4580.4 --> 4583.92
fascinating experiences

4584.96 --> 4588.4800000000005
in a way so have i

4587.199 --> 4589.5199999999995
but

4588.48 --> 4591.839999999999
yeah

4589.52 --> 4594.64
a lot of people have been through a lot

4591.84 --> 4595.6
of very interesting and

4594.64 --> 4597.1990000000005
interesting

4595.6 --> 4599.6
experiences that

4597.199 --> 4600.879999999999
pose learning opportunities to reflect

4599.6 --> 4602.88
upon

4600.88 --> 4604.64
but

4602.88 --> 4606.84
i'm just

4604.64 --> 4611.12
a really aiming for

4606.84 --> 4613.92
jesus for for his red text

4611.12 --> 4618.719
for his pattern his frequency

4613.92 --> 4620.64
and also especially that realization

4618.719 --> 4623.28
that

4620.64 --> 4624.88
almost everybody just constantly fails

4623.28 --> 4627.599999999999
in re it's like

4624.88 --> 4630.400000000001
it's right there for you to grab but

4627.6 --> 4631.52
almost everybody stumbles before

4630.4 --> 4633.839999999999
they get

4631.52 --> 4633.84
there

4635.36 --> 4638.0
but that's

4636.4 --> 4639.599999999999
a part of the learning process it

4638.0 --> 4641.92
doesn't mean you have to stop reaching

4639.6 --> 4641.92
for it

4644.719 --> 4651.199
now yeah other

4647.04 --> 4654.64
people's books and experiences and

4651.199 --> 4654.639999999999
they're good to reflect upon

4654.719 --> 4658.4
of course

4655.92 --> 4662.64
you can't just only reflect on one

4658.4 --> 4666.0
individual just because it is the best

4662.64 --> 4670.2390000000005
it's worth considering flaws like if

4666.0 --> 4670.239
somebody has a flaw or a weakness

4670.88 --> 4674.96
what are they doing with it

4672.719 --> 4676.32
are they overcoming it are they avoiding

4674.96 --> 4677.679
it

4676.32 --> 4681.04
how does

4677.679 --> 4683.84
the not getting it part

4681.04 --> 4686.08
influence the overall structure of their

4683.84 --> 4687.92
thinking and their feeling experiences

4686.08 --> 4690.159
it's a worthwhile study

4687.92 --> 4691.52
the effect of delusion is a worthwhile

4690.159 --> 4693.5199999999995
study

4691.52 --> 4695.6
to understand the nature of

4693.52 --> 4698.320000000001
consciousness and what it is like to the

4695.6 --> 4700.2390000000005
delusional because if you can reach them

4698.32 --> 4702.32
by understanding them

4700.239 --> 4705.199
you might also just

4702.32 --> 4708.0
be able to metaphorically

4705.199 --> 4709.44
put a ladder down the hole for them to

4708.0 --> 4710.64
climb up

4709.44 --> 4712.32
because if you're not trying to

4710.64 --> 4713.1990000000005
understand them you're not going to find

4712.32 --> 4714.799999999999
that

4713.199 --> 4717.28
entry

4714.8 --> 4718.719
to the hole they're in

4717.28 --> 4721.36
where they're trying to hide and you'll

4718.719 --> 4723.44
not be able to pass a ladder down

4721.36 --> 4724.4
you have to understand them and in order

4723.44 --> 4726.0
for

4724.4 --> 4727.759999999999
you to be able to understand them you

4726.0 --> 4728.64
must understand

4727.76 --> 4731.76
how

4728.64 --> 4734.64
a mistake a misassumption an error and

4731.76 --> 4736.88
the inability to overcome that error

4734.64 --> 4740.56
emotionally in the moment

4736.88 --> 4742.88
how that influences the entire broad

4740.56 --> 4745.280000000001
view and experience of an individual

4742.88 --> 4747.04
because there is a consistency

4745.28 --> 4750.48
to that sort of influence it's a

4747.04 --> 4752.32
consistent pattern i can feel it

4750.48 --> 4755.28
the pattern

4752.32 --> 4758.96
how people respond to such things is

4755.28 --> 4762.08
consistent they follow the same patterns

4758.96 --> 4763.76
and the more mistakes the more idiocy is

4762.08 --> 4766.4
piled on

4763.76 --> 4768.96
the more consistent

4766.4 --> 4770.5599999999995
the influence becomes and it becomes

4768.96 --> 4772.0
demonic

4770.56 --> 4775.0
eventually

4772.0 --> 4775.0
inevitably

4780.4 --> 4783.4
hmm

4814.639 --> 4818.8
what are you gonna base your norms and

4816.96 --> 4820.639
values on

4818.8 --> 4823.28
if not

4820.639 --> 4823.28
the bible

4823.36 --> 4828.96
like where are you going to reflect

4825.36 --> 4828.96
those norms and values on

4829.76 --> 4834.4800000000005
because if you don't have a safe anchor

4832.0 --> 4836.719
point to always have as a reference for

4834.48 --> 4838.718999999999
your norms and values

4836.719 --> 4839.44
then yeah only thing that has to happen

4838.719 --> 4841.84
a

4839.44 --> 4843.599999999999
bunch of very impressive blabbering

4841.84 --> 4844.88
individuals

4843.6 --> 4847.84
just talk

4844.88 --> 4850.08
new norms and values into you and then

4847.84 --> 4854.08
you'll be like oh yeah that's our norms

4850.08 --> 4855.92
and values now yeah yeah welcome

4854.08 --> 4857.04
welcome to the modern world that's what

4855.92 --> 4859.76
happens

4857.04 --> 4861.5199999999995
when you don't have a bible

4859.76 --> 4864.400000000001
as an anchor point for your norms and

4861.52 --> 4867.040000000001
values yeah you definitely need a book

4864.4 --> 4869.679
a very specific book with very specific

4867.04 --> 4872.32
text inside of that book

4869.679 --> 4874.4
or you're gonna go adrift you will be

4872.32 --> 4877.04
influenced if you don't have an anchor

4874.4 --> 4879.5199999999995
point for your norms and values

4877.04 --> 4882.56
you will be pulled in the moment

4879.52 --> 4884.719
you'll be persuaded that change

4882.56 --> 4887.6
and you won't even realize how

4884.719 --> 4891.4
devastating that actually is to do that

4887.6 --> 4891.400000000001
until it's too late

4906.08 --> 4910.88
what

4907.28 --> 4910.88
are you talking about mystical

4912.88 --> 4917.52
are you

4914.84 --> 4923.159000000001
dutch or did you just copy a dutch

4917.52 --> 4923.159000000001
sentence after google translating it

4931.52 --> 4935.1990000000005
treat one like you wish to be treated

4933.12 --> 4937.199
oneself yeah yeah that's

4935.199 --> 4940.32
well that's one of jesus's teachings

4937.199 --> 4943.719
isn't it this is one of oh oh jesus did

4940.32 --> 4943.719
oh yeah yeah

4944.56 --> 4948.4800000000005
i know where did you get that

4949.04 --> 4955.08
did you get it from jesus

4951.84 --> 4955.08
i did

4961.12 --> 4964.5599999999995
so

4962.159 --> 4966.48
you might want to retract your dutch

4964.56 --> 4969.4400000000005
spoken statement

4966.48 --> 4972.08
norms and values definitely require a

4969.44 --> 4973.28
bible now don't they what if that bible

4972.08 --> 4977.04
never

4973.28 --> 4979.199
existed for like 100 years and no

4977.04 --> 4982.48
person would be alive that has ever read

4979.199 --> 4984.4
about it or heard of jesus

4982.48 --> 4987.04
what are you going to reflect on

4984.4 --> 4989.5199999999995
maybe you're going to reflect on grandma

4987.04 --> 4991.44
or some

4989.52 --> 4993.280000000001
poet

4991.44 --> 4995.599999999999
that kind of uses that but where did he

4993.28 --> 4998.48
get it from what's the source where did

4995.6 --> 5001.84
it all come from

4998.48 --> 5001.839999999999
came from jesus

5020.639 --> 5024.0
if there was no bible everything would

5022.639 --> 5027.0
be [ __ ]

5024.0 --> 5027.0
guaranteed

5028.32 --> 5030.639
or

5029.28 --> 5034.08
there

5030.639 --> 5037.12
we might have not survived that far

5034.08 --> 5037.12
humanity i mean

5038.239 --> 5044.239
but again it's not even the bible bible

5040.8 --> 5046.8
was a control opposition attempt to use

5044.239 --> 5051.199
the glory of jesus

5046.8 --> 5054.400000000001
to create ironically a mind control

5051.199 --> 5056.48
religion to rule people's mind under the

5054.4 --> 5058.239
excuse of jesus but jesus is still in

5056.48 --> 5060.959999999999
there

5058.239 --> 5062.799999999999
right so if the bible in that format

5060.96 --> 5064.88
would have never existed

5062.8 --> 5066.96
who knows what the influence might be

5064.88 --> 5070.719
how different everything was but if

5066.96 --> 5074.2390000000005
there was like an original

5070.719 --> 5074.2390000000005
a real original of like

5075.36 --> 5078.719
whatever it was

5076.96 --> 5080.32
with jesus

5078.719 --> 5082.4
then yeah

5080.32 --> 5084.719
the same morals

5082.4 --> 5087.12
same teachings would still echo on to

5084.719 --> 5090.159
this day and shape everything because of

5087.12 --> 5090.159
the nature of the

5096.84 --> 5102.0
information disgusting

5099.84 --> 5103.28
oh so you're going to blame that

5102.0 --> 5106.08
again are you

5103.28 --> 5108.4
or you could blame a theocracy

5106.08 --> 5109.6
mystical and please stop writing in

5108.4 --> 5113.36
dutch

5109.6 --> 5114.88
nobody else understands that

5113.36 --> 5119.44
right

5114.88 --> 5121.52
yeah so so where exactly did jesus

5119.44 --> 5124.08
actually condone

5121.52 --> 5127.080000000001
any of that

5124.08 --> 5127.08
hmm

5129.84 --> 5134.400000000001
yep just because there is a book in

5132.4 --> 5136.32
existence with wise teachings doesn't

5134.4 --> 5138.638999999999
mean that people are going to follow

5136.32 --> 5140.4
that wise teachings no there's actually

5138.639 --> 5142.08
going to be people that are gonna be

5140.4 --> 5143.36
like no

5142.08 --> 5145.76
no

5143.36 --> 5147.679
i'm gonna [ __ ] it all up and i'm gonna

5145.76 --> 5151.280000000001
do whatever the [ __ ] i want and i'm

5147.679 --> 5151.28
gonna mind control you all

5152.56 --> 5158.719
and make you do [ __ ]

5155.04 --> 5158.719
under that guy's name

5159.84 --> 5165.76
because they're devils

5161.92 --> 5168.4
those are devils you understand

5165.76 --> 5171.280000000001
devils

5168.4 --> 5174.239
catholic church is a devil church it

5171.28 --> 5177.28
always was the entire conception of it

5174.239 --> 5180.5599999999995
is a devil scheme

5177.28 --> 5183.12
because it contradicts everything

5180.56 --> 5184.88
almost everything that jesus actually

5183.12 --> 5186.88
stood for

5184.88 --> 5189.76
and everything the church does and

5186.88 --> 5192.2390000000005
teaches is

5189.76 --> 5196.6
what other people blabbered on and

5192.239 --> 5196.599999999999
interpreted his works as

5199.199 --> 5204.5599999999995
yeah no that book didn't kill people

5201.36 --> 5209.12
people killed people

5204.56 --> 5211.4400000000005
you disgusting anti-christian scumbag

5209.12 --> 5214.48
you got some christ allergy or you just

5211.44 --> 5217.28
in the very very very early stage like a

5214.48 --> 5220.08
15 year old that just

5217.28 --> 5222.159
can't handle reality right i used to

5220.08 --> 5224.159
think like that when i was much younger

5222.159 --> 5226.879999999999
oh it's all the bible's fault all the

5224.159 --> 5228.879999999999
christians look at all the murders oh

5226.88 --> 5231.12
yeah and now imagine the world without

5228.88 --> 5231.12
that

5231.199 --> 5234.4
yeah

5232.4 --> 5237.04
it's gonna be a thousand times worse

5234.4 --> 5239.5199999999995
because that [ __ ] always happens there

5237.04 --> 5241.84
will always be devils standing up mind

5239.52 --> 5243.360000000001
controlling people and then destroying

5241.84 --> 5245.360000000001
things

5243.36 --> 5246.799999999999
constantly happens it's not because of

5245.36 --> 5249.5199999999995
that book

5246.8 --> 5251.52
i understand the book is what they use

5249.52 --> 5253.679
as a token

5251.52 --> 5256.400000000001
to try to protect themselves to give

5253.679 --> 5259.1990000000005
them some kind of spiritual legal cover

5256.4 --> 5261.04
when they do everything

5259.199 --> 5263.599999999999
that wrecks

5261.04 --> 5266.56
its legacy and that's how they

5263.6 --> 5268.08
put stains spiritually on it for other

5266.56 --> 5270.639
peoples to spot

5268.08 --> 5272.159
and then think oh well that means that

5270.639 --> 5274.0
book is wrong that means it's all

5272.159 --> 5275.5199999999995
[ __ ] because look of all the murders

5274.0 --> 5278.08
and all the disgusting things that

5275.52 --> 5280.639
happened since then

5278.08 --> 5284.96
it must be that book or it could be

5280.639 --> 5286.96
[ __ ] grabbler people devils in people

5284.96 --> 5288.96
faces

5286.96 --> 5293.12
abusing

5288.96 --> 5295.199
spiritual beliefs for their conquest

5293.12 --> 5298.4
how about that yeah that's happened with

5295.199 --> 5301.759999999999
every religion every religion every

5298.4 --> 5304.239
religion every religion every religion

5301.76 --> 5308.8
every single one of them every single

5304.239 --> 5311.199
one of them every single one of them

5308.8 --> 5314.0
always happens

5311.199 --> 5316.4
has nothing to do with jesus and his

5314.0 --> 5316.4
wisdom

5320.56 --> 5327.319
it's what people do it's what evil does

5323.54 --> 5327.319
[Music]

5333.199 --> 5337.759999999999
there's some light coming into the world

5335.28 --> 5340.159
some existential wisdom some insight

5337.76 --> 5342.96
that are gonna last the last the test

5340.159 --> 5346.879999999999
the time you better believe the shadow

5342.96 --> 5349.6
is gonna beef itself up to try to blot

5346.88 --> 5352.719
out that light it's what it does it's

5349.6 --> 5354.2390000000005
the natural system

5352.719 --> 5356.4800000000005
it's the balance between light and

5354.239 --> 5359.04
darkness it's the condition

5356.48 --> 5362.5599999999995
for this creation for our learning

5359.04 --> 5364.159
journey for the tests to be

5362.56 --> 5366.719
continual

5364.159 --> 5368.96
always be a new test because that's the

5366.719 --> 5371.04
purpose for our existence here to be

5368.96 --> 5372.4
tested by god

5371.04 --> 5375.04
right

5372.4 --> 5377.839999999999
so whenever a peak of light arises there

5375.04 --> 5381.679
will be a shadow to follow it happens

5377.84 --> 5384.32
every single time every single time

5381.679 --> 5387.52
has nothing to do with the light that

5384.32 --> 5389.679
was introduced with its quality it has

5387.52 --> 5392.400000000001
to do with

5389.679 --> 5393.6
the earthly the devil

5392.4 --> 5395.679
trying to

5393.6 --> 5398.0
blot it out

5395.679 --> 5400.719
try to make people forget about it

5398.0 --> 5403.719
dissuade them from looking into that

5400.719 --> 5403.719
light

5417.04 --> 5420.04
uh

5432.48 --> 5436.159
right there's the light

5434.48 --> 5438.638999999999
there's the physical and then there's

5436.159 --> 5441.199
the shadow shadow being the spirit

5438.639 --> 5443.52
shadow stronger the light

5441.199 --> 5446.5199999999995
the bigger the shadow cast by the

5443.52 --> 5446.52
physical

5456.239 --> 5461.32
dude get the [ __ ] out of here man you're

5458.159 --> 5461.32
a freak

5467.15 --> 5470.589999999999
[Music]

5474.159 --> 5480.32
you are going mental

5477.6 --> 5483.43
don't appreciate that

5480.32 --> 5483.429999999999
[Music]

5486.88 --> 5492.0
all right this is not the place to uh

5488.8 --> 5494.0
start out with your bible allergy

5492.0 --> 5497.44
and then when i go get into that in

5494.0 --> 5500.8
detail start incoherently rambling with

5497.44 --> 5504.239
alien face smiley [ __ ] yeah

5500.8 --> 5507.719
that's what a [ __ ] does

5504.239 --> 5507.718999999999
get out of here

5522.08 --> 5524.88
disappointing

5526.639 --> 5531.36
i always hope that

5528.32 --> 5534.08
maybe one time it turns out that

5531.36 --> 5537.36
direct confrontation doesn't lead

5534.08 --> 5539.679
to incoherent rambling like a madman but

5537.36 --> 5542.5599999999995
actual spontaneous awakening because

5539.679 --> 5546.639
they've been waiting for it for so long

5542.56 --> 5548.080000000001
like i was waiting for that so long

5546.639 --> 5550.8
in

5548.08 --> 5553.76
the delusion that the bible was all mind

5550.8 --> 5556.4800000000005
control [ __ ] alone

5553.76 --> 5556.4800000000005
only that

5558.32 --> 5561.84
when i rejected it

5562.88 --> 5568.400000000001
i was desperate for an actual christian

5565.44 --> 5572.32
to see me for what i was and then rescue

5568.4 --> 5574.48
me with the purest of wisdom

5572.32 --> 5576.799999999999
that would actually adapt

5574.48 --> 5580.32
to the complexities of my intellectual

5576.8 --> 5583.52
workings because i was very smart

5580.32 --> 5586.239
but yeah very much into detail

5583.52 --> 5588.96
when i was younger too

5586.239 --> 5592.0
but all the christians were weak they

5588.96 --> 5592.96
were weak they were all priest bound all

5592.0 --> 5594.48
of them

5592.96 --> 5597.04
they didn't get it they were just

5594.48 --> 5599.199
chanting [ __ ] in response to emotional

5597.04 --> 5601.6
confrontation

5599.199 --> 5602.879999999999
deeper philosophical pondering just

5601.6 --> 5604.719
chanting

5602.88 --> 5606.639
they didn't actually understand the

5604.719 --> 5610.28
words they were using so it was

5606.639 --> 5610.28
completely useless

5619.6 --> 5624.4800000000005
well i'm not one of those people i'm an

5621.92 --> 5626.4
eclectic christian i am not

5624.48 --> 5628.638999999999
priest bound

5626.4 --> 5629.679
i don't chant

5628.639 --> 5632.0
crap

5629.679 --> 5634.32
and tell you you must do this or you

5632.0 --> 5635.52
will have consequences

5634.32 --> 5640.0
like that

5635.52 --> 5642.88
i will just lay out how things work

5640.0 --> 5646.239
in reference to it and then i let you

5642.88 --> 5646.2390000000005
make up your own mind

5657.76 --> 5660.719
okay clutch

5669.36 --> 5672.759999999999
what is it

5678.639 --> 5683.84
do i hate level up at steve's chat what

5681.52 --> 5687.400000000001
what's steve's channel

5683.84 --> 5687.400000000001
does he have a channel

5688.32 --> 5693.84
she thinks you do

5691.04 --> 5693.84
i say no

5695.52 --> 5699.280000000001
i hate

5696.8 --> 5703.76
why i hate

5699.28 --> 5707.199
i'm severely disappointed annoyed

5703.76 --> 5708.320000000001
and absolutely not amused whatsoever by

5707.199 --> 5710.239
level up

5708.32 --> 5712.4
right hate is a bit of a strong word

5710.239 --> 5713.5199999999995
that would imply some kind of unanswered

5712.4 --> 5715.839999999999
love

5713.52 --> 5715.84
i don't

5737.36 --> 5740.36
right

5742.0 --> 5746.08
hatred is unanswered love

5744.4 --> 5748.32
and that's why gammas have so much

5746.08 --> 5750.8
hatred

5748.32 --> 5752.239
why did you love me here yeah

5750.8 --> 5753.84
i'm gonna hate you

5752.239 --> 5756.0
right revenge

5753.84 --> 5758.88
because they just wanted that love they

5756.0 --> 5758.88
were so desperate

5759.44 --> 5762.799999999999
but then they can't even accept the

5761.28 --> 5765.92
rejection

5762.8 --> 5768.320000000001
so they just go for the hate immediately

5765.92 --> 5771.84
that's how you end up a gamma

5768.32 --> 5771.84
it's a lot of unanswered love

5778.239 --> 5784.159
you had my back okay clutch i appreciate

5780.88 --> 5786.32
that i do appreciate that actually

5784.159 --> 5788.879999999999
because

5786.32 --> 5793.199
there's not a lot of people

5788.88 --> 5793.1990000000005
that are defending my position in this

5793.36 --> 5798.0
i feel very lucky that it is kind of a

5796.0 --> 5798.8
thing

5798.0 --> 5802.719
through

5798.8 --> 5805.360000000001
owen benjamin's bear legacy

5802.719 --> 5807.44
because now i'm not so alone it's almost

5805.36 --> 5809.44
well it is kind of the reason why i did

5807.44 --> 5813.919999999999
just make a stand with it it's because

5809.44 --> 5815.919999999999
like if it's only me only me

5813.92 --> 5817.92
like the [ __ ]

5815.92 --> 5820.2390000000005
that would be terrible because like

5817.92 --> 5823.4400000000005
who's gonna support me

5820.239 --> 5827.44
when i basically oppose the majority of

5823.44 --> 5829.44
religious convictions like that right

5827.44 --> 5831.199
where would i be able to go

5829.44 --> 5833.119
nowhere

5831.199 --> 5834.799999999999
but because owen benjamin kind of

5833.119 --> 5837.28
simultaneously

5834.8 --> 5839.92
started addressing these issues i had

5837.28 --> 5842.48
the opportunity to also make my stand

5839.92 --> 5842.4800000000005
parallel

5843.84 --> 5848.159000000001
and now i know there's others out there

5845.92 --> 5851.04
that will at least just

5848.159 --> 5854.5599999999995
not be directly offended

5851.04 --> 5856.239
by my conclusions and my thoughts

5854.56 --> 5859.6
so that i had still have somebody to

5856.239 --> 5859.599999999999
reflect upon with them

5866.32 --> 5871.599999999999
i like her she has some who are we

5868.96 --> 5871.6
talking about

5872.32 --> 5875.36
oh still paula

5878.48 --> 5883.5599999999995
look she's a scholar

5880.56 --> 5883.56
right

5884.08 --> 5890.639
and i respect that

5886.239 --> 5890.638999999999
i respect that part about her

5891.44 --> 5895.44
but

5892.719 --> 5897.84
i've known her and i followed her like

5895.44 --> 5897.839999999999
for years

5898.32 --> 5902.239
starting a very long time ago it's like

5900.56 --> 5904.0
four years ago

5902.239 --> 5906.159
uh

5904.0 --> 5909.76
i don't even want to highlight the

5906.159 --> 5910.799999999999
issues i don't want to

5909.76 --> 5913.1990000000005
because

5910.8 --> 5914.4800000000005
i still respect her enough even though i

5913.199 --> 5917.04
get the feeling it's not being

5914.48 --> 5919.28
reciprocated

5917.04 --> 5923.28
because of courtesy and because there

5919.28 --> 5925.759999999999
are people kind of still studying

5923.28 --> 5928.0
alongside what she does right the

5925.76 --> 5929.119000000001
esoteric studying and just all the

5928.0 --> 5931.28
references

5929.119 --> 5933.36
to lay out a map of how all the

5931.28 --> 5935.36
priesthoods have done

5933.36 --> 5937.679
their thing

5935.36 --> 5939.599999999999
is still good that somebody out there

5937.679 --> 5941.92
knows that hasn't oversighted and i

5939.6 --> 5941.92
don't

5942.48 --> 5946.159
right so i respect that but that's about

5945.199 --> 5948.4
it

5946.159 --> 5951.879999999999
other than that i i don't want to get

5948.4 --> 5951.879999999999
into the details

5952.0 --> 5956.0
but yeah she's anything but a flawless

5954.639 --> 5959.8
individual

5956.0 --> 5959.8
and she knows that

5966.719 --> 5970.0
it's just that sometimes she tends to

5968.639 --> 5973.28
forget that

5970.0 --> 5973.28
gets a little compulsive

5974.4 --> 5980.0
and i do not respect that

5977.679 --> 5982.8
from an older lady i don't you should be

5980.0 --> 5988.679
wiser than that period no excuse

5982.8 --> 5988.679
just no excuse sorry that's my judgment

5995.679 --> 5999.52
if you're going to be an arbiter of

5997.199 --> 6001.839999999999
priestly knowledge

5999.52 --> 6004.2390000000005
then there are certain lines you

6001.84 --> 6007.88
should never cross

6004.239 --> 6007.879999999999
you should know better

6010.8 --> 6015.52
right and when i mean don't cross i

6013.119 --> 6017.839999999999
don't i mean never ever

6015.52 --> 6020.159000000001
like have that

6017.84 --> 6023.4400000000005
spiritually surgically removed from

6020.159 --> 6026.719
yourself and she doesn't

6023.44 --> 6028.799999999999
and in at that she's in repentant

6026.719 --> 6031.52
because she doesn't recognize it

6028.8 --> 6031.52
officially

6032.239 --> 6036.119
so

6033.119 --> 6036.119
anyway

6036.159 --> 6038.4
uh

6038.48 --> 6042.159
doesn't really matter i don't know if

6040.32 --> 6044.799999999999
she's gonna get all outraged over this

6042.159 --> 6044.799999999999
or whatever

6046.96 --> 6052.159
i just don't

6048.719 --> 6054.2390000000005
want to get somewhere say hey i don't

6052.159 --> 6057.759999999999
like this chanting

6054.239 --> 6060.959999999999
and then immediately get accused of

6057.76 --> 6062.96
attacking people right

6060.96 --> 6064.56
being skeptical about something and

6062.96 --> 6067.36
expressing

6064.56 --> 6069.280000000001
that is not an attack if you think

6067.36 --> 6071.839999999999
that's an attack then you are a

6069.28 --> 6075.28
religious fanatic zealot

6071.84 --> 6075.28
and should be avoided

6075.36 --> 6078.679
good servant

6102.48 --> 6107.36
thank you that's the writer

6105.36 --> 6110.239
the pandemic also back the argument

6107.36 --> 6113.199
priest class yep it's another spell set

6110.239 --> 6115.839999999999
up right that's what priests do priests

6113.199 --> 6118.5599999999995
weave the spell and then the people that

6115.84 --> 6120.159000000001
buy into it they take that ticket yeah

6118.56 --> 6124.88
they gobble it all up and then they

6120.159 --> 6124.879999999999
become the flock of that priesthood

6126.0 --> 6131.679
it's the same system

6127.92 --> 6132.96
same mechanism same setup the same

6131.679 --> 6134.96
supply

6132.96 --> 6137.84
and demand

6134.96 --> 6140.4
it's just it's a market it's very basic

6137.84 --> 6143.96

6140.4 --> 6143.96
spiritual economics

and

6245.28 --> 6249.28
pretty good behaviors it doesn't seem to

6247.199 --> 6252.159
be any trolls in today

6249.28 --> 6254.4
and mystical i don't think he's a troll

6252.159 --> 6257.44
but he's

6254.4 --> 6261.04
i i did don't want that [ __ ] here

6257.44 --> 6263.839999999999
he's not behaviorally trained yet

6261.04 --> 6265.679
enough for to to be a regular guest here

6263.84 --> 6267.84
in my chat

6265.679 --> 6270.0
but i don't know maybe i'll bump into

6267.84 --> 6272.32
him later and if he'd ask me in some

6270.0 --> 6276.239
other chat like hey sorry about this

6272.32 --> 6276.239
could you unblock me i'll probably do it

6276.32 --> 6281.599999999999
in fact

6277.36 --> 6281.599999999999
i might just unblock him right now

6282.159 --> 6286.28
maybe just needed a good timeout

6288.159 --> 6293.36
we'll see if he shows back up

6291.04 --> 6295.5199999999995
