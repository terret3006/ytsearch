the air is like really cold it's

123.079 --> 126.83999999999999

2024 temperature

151.44 --> 160.68
yeah 3° C right so yeah it is actually

156.48 --> 162.23899999999998
cold says it could even

160.68 --> 165.0
snow

162.239 --> 168.59900000000002
93% humidity

165.0 --> 171.76
sheesh yeah no wonder so this it's like

168.599 --> 174.319
water cold little above it but that's

171.76 --> 176.519
like what closer it gets to really moist

174.319 --> 179.11999999999998
and 1° the colder it

176.519 --> 183.36
gets then if it freezes it actually

179.12 --> 186.36
become you experience it as let's

183.36 --> 186.36
go

199.319 --> 206.48

214.4 --> 220.799
birthday but uh yesterday yes and it was

219.159 --> 223.79899999999998

224.72 --> 230.28
basically

226.959 --> 233.56

301.24 --> 304.8
in coconut oil it's kind of hardened up

303.16 --> 306.88000000000005
so I could just hold it like this

304.8 --> 310.44
without it sliding out of the

356.479 --> 360.88
it was hot

358.479 --> 363.639
enough

360.88 --> 366.52
so I just added some Red Hot Chili

468.159 --> 475.08
this hello hi hello out there this is

475.199 --> 481.319
live ah or kble first in chat good to

478.479 --> 481.31899999999996
see you

484.96 --> 492.52
since

487.639 --> 492.52
yeah yeah thanks for that or I

493.68 --> 499.199
know so whatever that nonsense was

496.479 --> 502.639
yesterday from the guy that I

499.199 --> 502.639
banned it is

508.24 --> 511.24
nonsense

512.76 --> 518.88
right like yeah sometimes Arwin actually

515.76 --> 520.36
knows what he talks about I might not be

518.88 --> 523.68
like

520.36 --> 527.76
this this internet digging researcher as

523.68 --> 532.3199999999999
much as I used to be like 20 years ago

527.76 --> 532.3199999999999
but like I have picked up on certain

534.839 --> 541.6400000000001
things so you just can't fool me as

538.32 --> 543.8000000000001
easily by just saying oh this is like no

541.64 --> 545.519
I'll have a good there's a good chance

543.8 --> 547.68
I'll actually know whether that's true

545.519 --> 547.68
or

551.36 --> 556.32
not 10 checks seconds to check I didn't

554.519 --> 559.8
even check

556.32 --> 562.1600000000001
right I mean you were there right oraku

559.8 --> 564.92
I didn't Flinch because I was very

562.16 --> 567.04
certain about my case like I I didn't

564.92 --> 571.88
need to do a research do a search or

567.04 --> 571.88
Google or whatever I just new like

576.839 --> 582.0790000000001
no right but apparently you can really

580.079 --> 584.92
easily Google search it so I don't know

582.079 --> 584.92
what the hell that was

585.32 --> 588.5600000000001
about all

591.44 --> 597.0
right definitely

594.24 --> 599.6
no sodium

597.0 --> 604.079
fluide in the drinking water in the

599.6 --> 604.0790000000001
Netherlands but it used to be there

605.48 --> 618.739
though but not during my lifetime thank

608.97 --> 618.739
[Music]

623.2 --> 627.279
God all right anyway how are you

628.04 --> 631.04
doing

639.33 --> 643.519
[Music]

641.24 --> 643.519
let's

646.12 --> 649.299
[Music]

658.04 --> 661.04
see

666.82 --> 670.009
[Music]

674.32 --> 677.0790000000001
right so

679.519 --> 683.32
yeah what was I doing

687.959 --> 690.959
yesterday

704.68 --> 710.1999999999999
okay I'll just leave it like

707.11 --> 710.2
[Music]

717.959 --> 720.959
that

726.72 --> 733.24
yeah I don't really know what to talk

728.24 --> 736.8
about it all depends what the Animo is

733.24 --> 736.8
going to be what the energy is going to

736.92 --> 742.7199999999999
be yesterday for me was kind of boring

739.56 --> 744.6389999999999
in ways oh yeah I spent a lot of my time

742.72 --> 748.24
just making my

744.639 --> 750.279
dinner the evening and try to watch a

748.24 --> 752.5600000000001
movie later own Benjamin when it was

750.279 --> 752.56
very

752.92 --> 758.3199999999999
short I tried to watch Despicable Me but

756.079 --> 760.519
it was a real chore I didn't get through

758.32 --> 760.519
it

765.44 --> 771.72
all I'd actually never watched it before

768.959 --> 773.8
because every time I saw any kind of

771.72 --> 777.839
advertisement for it when it came out I

773.8 --> 780.8389999999999
was just like really like I hate

777.839 --> 780.839
this

783.92 --> 791.36
it was like it was too

788.36 --> 794.0
popular when it's too popular there's

791.36 --> 796.92
something wrong about

794.0 --> 798.68
it like you can feel like it's not even

796.92 --> 801.4399999999999
like oh everybody knows about it's so

798.68 --> 802.3599999999999
popular no it's about how it's popular

801.44 --> 805.519
with

802.36 --> 808.279
people and when sometimes it's just

805.519 --> 811.24
wrong and then I like don't want to have

808.279 --> 811.24
anything to do with

811.8 --> 816.12
it it's the same issue with the series

814.44 --> 818.5600000000001
Lost it's just

816.12 --> 822.24
like

818.56 --> 826.1199999999999
no but yeah in this case like it kept

822.24 --> 829.24
popping up with my Netflix and I'm

826.12 --> 833.5600000000001
like I should probably check it

829.24 --> 834.8
out just to see like why I didn't want

833.56 --> 837.7589999999999
to watch

834.8 --> 840.7589999999999
it and it is very

837.759 --> 840.759
annoying

844.8 --> 848.8
like I guess if you're like a

846.199 --> 852.4399999999999
hyperactive little kid it might be kind

848.8 --> 852.4399999999999
of funny

852.6 --> 855.6
but

863.079 --> 869.68
no you couldn't finish it oh wow so it's

866.079 --> 871.4399999999999
not just me yeah I'm like have I'm still

869.68 --> 874.519
going to try to finish it but I've

871.44 --> 877.9590000000001
already decided like I don't like

874.519 --> 881.32
this it's just I I need to have finished

877.959 --> 883.959
it just to be able to reference it more

881.32 --> 886.48
detail I'm I'm wasting this sounds I'm

883.959 --> 886.4799999999999
watching it

887.639 --> 892.92
professionally sorry and that's the joke

894.78 --> 899.16
[Music]

896.72 --> 901.5600000000001
yeah and there's like three three or

899.16 --> 904.36
four of these movies or even more I

901.56 --> 907.6389999999999
don't even know and it's all just about

904.36 --> 909.519
the stupid little yellow

907.639 --> 912.88
things

909.519 --> 914.44
GH but they're so cute and

912.88 --> 917.68
funny

914.44 --> 921.0400000000001
no no not

917.68 --> 925.279
really they're gimmicky

921.04 --> 925.279
[ __ ] and completely

927.6 --> 930.6
psychopathic

931.759 --> 936.639
they're just messed

934.36 --> 940.88
up I don't know that that's what it

936.639 --> 943.319
seems so far anyway maybe they have yeah

940.88 --> 946.4399999999999
they sort of have like oh moments of

943.319 --> 948.24
character development sort of but then

946.44 --> 954.1990000000001
at other moment it's like ah who gives a

948.24 --> 954.199
[ __ ] it so that's maybe sociopathic is

954.6 --> 959.44
better although yeah they are working

957.079 --> 960.92
with the super villain to

959.44 --> 964.48
do no

960.92 --> 966.399
good I mean the entire premise has been

964.48 --> 969.0790000000001
like

966.399 --> 970.92
cartoonish and then

969.079 --> 973.68
just

970.92 --> 975.68
sorry I'm not ready to basically

973.68 --> 980.2399999999999
criticize it fully yet but I'm already

975.68 --> 984.12
like ready I'm I'm ready to give this

980.24 --> 984.12
thing a treatment

985.639 --> 994.319
basically but not QE style I'm not gonna

989.519 --> 994.319
play it and then go pause and say

998.0 --> 1003.399
what because probably if I tried to

1000.639 --> 1005.6
stream it my I'd get a copyright strike

1003.399 --> 1005.6
for

1009.399 --> 1020.48
it I have a strong suspicion of

1013.56 --> 1020.4799999999999
that anyhow that's my day yesterday

1267.039 --> 1274.559
fun of with any kind of people out there

it if I'm capable of making fun of a

1279.0 --> 1287.0
people then that endear them to me more

1283.24 --> 1287.0

1287.039 --> 1294.039
them especially if they're man enough to

1291.52 --> 1294.039
just take

1306.919 --> 1313.919
it it's funny if they actually have that

1310.919 --> 1313.919
accent

1314.24 --> 1319.52
no no then it could be bullying if they

1317.4 --> 1323.6000000000001

1547.88 --> 1555.279
it it makes me feel free and it makes me

1552.399 --> 1557.4799999999998
feel even though it might be sort of an

1555.279 --> 1559.919
illusion it's not an illusion to me it

1557.48 --> 1564.3990000000001
makes makes me feel like I can just do

1559.919 --> 1567.5200000000002
that because it's fun it's fun to do

1564.399 --> 1570.799
voices and it's fun to try that out and

1567.52 --> 1574.279
to see like how the mechanisms of your

1570.799 --> 1576.96
brain work as you try to adapt it's fun

1574.279 --> 1580.279
it's a challenge it's a challenge down

1576.96 --> 1584.48
my Lane I like doing it as kind of a

1580.279 --> 1588.64
hobby linguist I like doing it I don't

1584.48 --> 1592.76
care make a change from the silly Dutch

1588.64 --> 1594.3600000000001
accent what you have a problem with my

1592.76 --> 1597.64
Dutch

1594.36 --> 1600.6
accent normally I don't really talk like

1597.64 --> 1605.6000000000001
that I don't know why you're making such

1600.6 --> 1609.0
a strange complaint cuz I never talk

1605.6 --> 1615.279
like a Dutch person because it's really

1609.0 --> 1615.279
annoying to me okay so that's where that

1616.6 --> 1624.24
ends

1619.48 --> 1627.24
yeah it's my silly Dutch accent

1624.24 --> 1627.24
dude

1630.279 --> 1638.32
SW I can do the accent oh yeah I can do

1634.64 --> 1640.679
high Dutch High German accent but I

1638.32 --> 1644.039
don't I haven't really mastered the

1640.679 --> 1644.039
language it's like

1644.96 --> 1650.24
different think that I be if I be

1647.6 --> 1653.1589999999999
hanging around German speaking people I

1650.24 --> 1655.72
would probably catch on eventually it

1653.159 --> 1658.1200000000001
did happen every time I would go to wave

1655.72 --> 1660.3990000000001
Gothic TR which is in the middle of

1658.12 --> 1662.84
Germany and then just being surrounded

1660.399 --> 1668.559
by German people i' eventually start to

1662.84 --> 1668.559
become able to like really follow their

1668.88 --> 1674.24
conversations I just never really like

1671.88 --> 1676.8400000000001
learned German in

1674.24 --> 1679.519
school I was just only interested in

1676.84 --> 1679.519
English

1685.84 --> 1692.279
yeah

1687.6 --> 1695.6
so I'm all right I'm doing just great

1692.279 --> 1699.6
it's good to to

1695.6 --> 1699.6
see things coming out of the

1700.12 --> 1704.6789999999999
Woodworks oh you do Indian accent all

1702.559 --> 1707.48
the time

1704.679 --> 1709.3600000000001
Oro right and I bet I bet you suck at it

1707.48 --> 1712.64
a lot of people really suck at it

1709.36 --> 1714.9599999999998
sometimes I suck at it to do it right

1712.64 --> 1720.48
you have to like really kind of focus

1714.96 --> 1720.48
for a bit and I'm like I can't be

1724.48 --> 1729.919
ar I'll just do the accent it's it's

1728.32 --> 1731.96
cultural

1729.919 --> 1735.88
appropriation

1731.96 --> 1738.039
mockery of like a really sloppy accent

1735.88 --> 1740.519
that's like all over the place could be

1738.039 --> 1742.84
several thing several type of accents at

1740.519 --> 1746.6
the same time slid sliding in one

1742.84 --> 1751.72
another like the worst but I'll just do

1746.6 --> 1751.7199999999998
it because I have fun doing

1766.32 --> 1773.039
it

1768.279 --> 1776.72
and like dude I'd like to see people try

1773.039 --> 1780.32
to make fun of the Dutch accent that

1776.72 --> 1782.96
aren't Dutch yeah because there's the

1780.32 --> 1785.12
like a comedian guy on YouTube that just

1782.96 --> 1788.3600000000001
kept bumping into for a while and he

1785.12 --> 1792.2399999999998
literally makes a lot of funny short

1788.36 --> 1796.039
videos about the Dutch accent with

1792.24 --> 1798.159
English and I'm laughing my ass off

1796.039 --> 1802.32
because it's so right and it's like it

1798.159 --> 1806.24
makes me really happy that that's there

1802.32 --> 1809.4399999999998
but like I'd like to see a non-dutch

1806.24 --> 1812.72

Austrian German is is quite

different the German accent is quite

1856.24 --> 1862.3990000000001

2387.76 --> 2393.96

2391.04 --> 2397.2799999999997
like I basically gave him the room I

2393.96 --> 2399.76
like so like gave him the room to

2397.28 --> 2404.2000000000003
potentially realize that and like maybe

2399.76 --> 2407.6800000000003

2404.2 --> 2409.4399999999996

oh you're such a

2411.8 --> 2415.4
victim and that's

2417.04 --> 2422.2799999999997
gay if that was his attitude from the

2420.0 --> 2425.319
start he would have never even made it

2422.28 --> 2425.3190000000004
longer than like a

2425.359 --> 2430.37
week

2428.119 --> 2435.84
I don't know what the hell's happened to

2430.37 --> 2435.8399999999997
[Music]

2452.119 --> 2458.6800000000003
him sounded funny yeah no problem it's

2455.92 --> 2458.6800000000003
it's good to

2465.4 --> 2472.56
laugh oh yeah and also there aren't any

2468.92 --> 2472.56
rules against cultural

2472.76 --> 2478.7200000000003
appropriation there's just peer pressure

2475.04 --> 2481.359
and shaming [ __ ] yeah I mean it's a

2478.72 --> 2482.68
freefor all I'm not going to appropriate

2481.359 --> 2486.44
cultural

2482.68 --> 2488.68
things from others if I feel like it hey

2486.44 --> 2490.8
and if they want to appropriate my

2488.68 --> 2495.24
culture they're free

2490.8 --> 2495.2400000000002
to yeah you can just like do

2495.8 --> 2501.92
that and then that might feel a bit

2498.4 --> 2503.4
weird for me and it's like oh hm they're

2501.92 --> 2506.6800000000003
culturally

2503.4 --> 2509.04
appropriating my language or my country

2506.68 --> 2512.5989999999997
and then I'm like well at least they're

2509.04 --> 2512.599
trying you know good

2515.24 --> 2519.0
luck

2517.04 --> 2521.72
all right Oro W thanks for holding the

2519.0 --> 2521.72
fort at the

2522.2 --> 2529.56
start go talk got to

2525.8 --> 2531.88
him yeah but that's not really my talk

2529.56 --> 2535.64
though blue pill Evolution I didn't

2531.88 --> 2539.28
really talk about it here I mean that

2535.64 --> 2541.68
stuff went on at Owen Benjamin and I'm

2539.28 --> 2545.1600000000003
pretty damn sure I didn't

2541.68 --> 2548.16
like throw it out there in the

2545.16 --> 2548.16
chat

2555.28 --> 2561.76
right I was basically holding the roof

2558.44 --> 2566.64
to prevent the Poo from piling

2561.76 --> 2566.6400000000003
on here when that was going

2566.76 --> 2575.4
on right so that's not my

2571.68 --> 2579.16
fault like I actually tried to protect

2575.4 --> 2584.319
him from that cuz I I thought like that

2579.16 --> 2584.319
is very far like I was worried for

2584.48 --> 2591.559
him I dude I was in Owen Benjamin's

2588.599 --> 2593.559
Rumble chat literally saying I have an

2591.559 --> 2596.6400000000003
Indian friend and he's not like that at

2593.559 --> 2601.0
all and he he is embarrassed about it

2596.64 --> 2604.2
like I was trying to protect him yeah

2601.0 --> 2608.48
okay but he didn't

2604.2 --> 2610.7999999999997
care it just didn't show up and now he's

2608.48 --> 2615.4
complaining about how I do the mean

2610.8 --> 2615.4
accent like you got to be kidding me

2620.599 --> 2626.1600000000003
man you can't be serious with that it's

2627.49 --> 2630.6099999999997
[Music]

2635.079 --> 2638.079
ridiculous

2647.76 --> 2651.76
debate raging debate over if it happens

2650.96 --> 2655.28
or

2651.76 --> 2655.28
not in this

2656.16 --> 2661.72
country here on the show if what

2662.72 --> 2669.5589999999997
happens oh right yes

2666.92 --> 2672.6800000000003
yeah but that was my question it's

2669.559 --> 2678.4
like can you be honest about

2672.68 --> 2682.0789999999997
it cuz yeah obviously it is like

2678.4 --> 2685.559
embarrassing or weird and I was

2682.079 --> 2687.6800000000003
fascinated by it as a concept I was

2685.559 --> 2689.599
actually when I was going with that

2687.68 --> 2691.1189999999997
after that he dropped I was really

2689.599 --> 2694.44
thinking like we're going to go to the

2691.119 --> 2696.6400000000003
next level here like his strength and my

2694.44 --> 2700.119
strength and together we can be strong

2696.64 --> 2702.68
and then figure this out like figure I

2700.119 --> 2706.52
wanted to figure out the mystery of it

2702.68 --> 2711.44
like why is that

2706.52 --> 2715.559
there what is that but yeah poof it all

2711.44 --> 2718.44
blew up and oh ter couldn't handle it oh

2715.559 --> 2720.52
yeah thanks a lot I had a a a giant

2718.44 --> 2724.119
research project ready for us to

2720.52 --> 2728.52
basically try to figure out but oh no it

2724.119 --> 2733.88
too much for you yeah I mean it's the

2728.52 --> 2733.88
point another wasted opportunity for

2738.4 --> 2742.359
research kind of seems fake

2742.72 --> 2746.3999999999996
outrage it seemed

2754.88 --> 2757.88
lame

2760.88 --> 2767.2000000000003
yeah responsible for their well I

2764.4 --> 2769.839
actually blue Evolution I do get that

2767.2 --> 2773.64
part the feeling responsible I have

2769.839 --> 2775.44
similar issues on massive skills I

2773.64 --> 2777.7999999999997
sometimes I feel responsible for like

2775.44 --> 2780.04
everyone which is

2777.8 --> 2783.04
irrational that's why it's

2780.04 --> 2783.04
feelings

2783.359 --> 2790.4
but there's no point

2786.319 --> 2793.8
in then responding to it like

2790.4 --> 2798.7200000000003
that you're going to take responsibility

2793.8 --> 2798.7200000000003
then you better learn how to not be

2806.28 --> 2809.28
offended

2814.04 --> 2817.8
what yeah

2818.28 --> 2823.88
I figured that

2819.96 --> 2823.88
out all right so

2827.119 --> 2833.2000000000003
yeah no thanks

2829.88 --> 2835.76

celery and

2866.8 --> 2873.28
pakoy and it's great and I have a lot of

2870.44 --> 2874.68
it if you want to see that then go all

2873.28 --> 2877.079
the way back to the beginning of the

2874.68 --> 2878.52
show cuz I show it in like the first 5

2877.079 --> 2881.3590000000004
minutes or

2878.52 --> 2882.87
something

2881.359 --> 2886.2799999999997
right first

2882.87 --> 2886.2799999999997
[Music]

2887.559 --> 2894.079
10 what's the weather like it

2890.599 --> 2897.3590000000004

yeah it's like

2897.359 --> 2902.24
3° and it's very

2903.4 --> 2912.76
moist like really 95 % or something so

2974.72 --> 2979.0
one degree yeah that's the worst that's

2977.24 --> 2983.2
the worst water

2979.0 --> 2983.2
cold hot water bottle

2994.52 --> 2997.52
yeah

3001.16 --> 3006.3999999999996
right so yeah maybe we can move on

3012.48 --> 3018.52
now I'm sure jamc level is going to have

3015.96 --> 3019.64
like an episode or how offensive my

3018.52 --> 3023.04
accent is

3019.64 --> 3027.0789999999997
and I'm sure but hey that's fine do that

3023.04 --> 3028.64
you know I'm really offensive so

3027.079 --> 3032.559
offensive

3028.64 --> 3035.52
that like people over Owen Benjamin's

3032.559 --> 3037.6800000000003
even like give him super chats to tell

3035.52 --> 3040.48
him how gay I am

3037.68 --> 3043.319
so they it seems to be a thing now

3040.48 --> 3046.52
everywhere so oh I'm the most offensive

3043.319 --> 3047.839
person in the freaking world oh too

3046.52 --> 3051.44
freaking

3047.839 --> 3053.48
bad keep it up it's only going to be

3051.44 --> 3056.119
more people that are like wow why are

3053.48 --> 3057.92
these guys always dissing on that guy

3056.119 --> 3062.7200000000003
like that's the only thing that comes

3057.92 --> 3062.7200000000003
out of it because they don't

3082.64 --> 3087.359
care

3084.359 --> 3087.359
h

3100.82 --> 3104.0190000000002
[Music]

3106.49 --> 3113.9489999999996
[Music]

3114.359 --> 3117.359
for

3143.119 --> 3150.76
okay really is that

3146.24 --> 3150.7599999999998
usual in California in the winter

3154.44 --> 3160.16
time is it normally much

3157.76 --> 3162.599
drier didn't like California have a

3160.16 --> 3166.72
whole period of floods and all

3162.599 --> 3167.799
that doesn't it like kind of randomly go

3166.72 --> 3170.359
like

3167.799 --> 3174.119
that long periods have dried and then

3170.359 --> 3174.119
suddenly it gets flooded all the

3174.24 --> 3177.24
time

3192.44 --> 3198.319
I thought drought yeah but one but the

3195.52 --> 3201.44
point is here we go like there's either

3198.319 --> 3204.079
a drought in California or a flood is

3201.44 --> 3204.079
kind of what I'm

3204.16 --> 3207.16
saying

3214.47 --> 3221.5699999999997
[Music]

3234.16 --> 3237.16
right

3239.34 --> 3242.3990000000003
[Music]

3247.76 --> 3254.6800000000003
right I'm going to get my

3249.28 --> 3254.6800000000003
coffee out the C be right

3264.079 --> 3267.079
back

3368.88 --> 3371.52
okay and I'm

3383.92 --> 3386.92
back

3387.96 --> 3394.039
they always claim

3390.599 --> 3394.039
drought okay that's

3396.48 --> 3402.319
weird but I mean

3399.359 --> 3404.24
like maybe they mean like they can

3402.319 --> 3408.24
always use more rain because that will

3404.24 --> 3408.24
fill up the water reservoirs or

3412.76 --> 3416.88
something I'm not sure

3443.799 --> 3446.799
h

3451.44 --> 3454.48
right anyway the weather

3460.119 --> 3466.2400000000002
sucks people are whiny and complaining

3463.2 --> 3467.9199999999996
about the things that I do here they

3466.24 --> 3470.7599999999998
always seem to find something else

3467.92 --> 3470.76
that's wrong about

3473.799 --> 3476.799
me

3479.319 --> 3485.079
it's a good thing that I like really

3481.599 --> 3488.6800000000003
don't care like actually not caring and

3485.079 --> 3490.599
just like no I'm going to just do

3488.68 --> 3494.9199999999996
it

3490.599 --> 3498.92
like I've separated myself from that

3494.92 --> 3498.92
kind of thing with the world a long time

3500.119 --> 3507.44
ago I'm not going to be shamed

3503.319 --> 3507.44
into not doing doing certain

3507.799 --> 3515.16
things I shame myself already way enough

3513.319 --> 3518.5589999999997
about certain

3515.16 --> 3521.359
things I'm very strict towards myself

3518.559 --> 3521.3590000000004
very specific

3524.48 --> 3531.76
ways especially when it comes to the

3529.0 --> 3535.4
intention of things like

3531.76 --> 3538.039
what what do I think and feel in the

3535.4 --> 3540.52
background as I do certain things the

3538.039 --> 3543.44
intention matters a

3540.52 --> 3545.72
lot yeah and when I make fun of things I

3543.44 --> 3548.48
don't mean harm to

3545.72 --> 3551.68
them unless I go rage win and then I

3548.48 --> 3551.68
definitely mean harm to

3553.799 --> 3558.7599999999998
them and then I'll be like oh try to

3557.039 --> 3561.88
contain myself

3558.76 --> 3564.3190000000004
like right but you don't have to worry

3561.88 --> 3567.599
because I don't really physically follow

3564.319 --> 3567.599
through on any rage

3569.839 --> 3576.119
anyway it's more about like spreading

3573.2 --> 3576.1189999999997
the idea of

3576.64 --> 3582.2799999999997
it and giving recognition that that's in

3584.76 --> 3590.8390000000004
people and it's not just about your

3587.44 --> 3593.48
petty Personal Image and ego it's about

3590.839 --> 3593.48
certain

3593.64 --> 3596.64
values

3597.559 --> 3603.48
a whole range of

3599.68 --> 3605.64
them that's just like this is we feel

3603.48 --> 3606.599
this is what is acceptable this is what

3605.64 --> 3609.0
isn't

3606.599 --> 3614.799
acceptable and then there's still

3609.0 --> 3614.799
personal leniency depending on your own

3615.4 --> 3621.1600000000003
character because nobody's

3618.359 --> 3623.0389999999998
perfect right just like the idea of like

3621.16 --> 3625.24
everybody tries to follow the Bible in

3623.039 --> 3627.8390000000004
the ways of Christ

3625.24 --> 3630.1189999999997
in their own way and they might have

3627.839 --> 3634.0789999999997
certain sins that will be chasing them

3630.119 --> 3637.48
their entire life right point is then to

3634.079 --> 3641.2400000000002
recognize that it is such to never

3637.48 --> 3646.0
like try to justify it

3641.24 --> 3646.0
right all that sort of thing is about

3647.119 --> 3651.799
values and nobody's going to tell me

3649.68 --> 3655.68
like

3651.799 --> 3660.24
oh just because you say say things like

3655.68 --> 3662.319
this or you you make fun of certain

3660.24 --> 3665.2799999999997
accents doing

3662.319 --> 3667.119
it or make fun with like even saying it

3665.28 --> 3669.1600000000003
you're making fun of it's like no I'm

3667.119 --> 3672.52
making fun

3669.16 --> 3677.24
with I don't like making fun of things I

3672.52 --> 3677.24
make like I like making fun with

3683.44 --> 3686.44
things

3691.039 --> 3696.3190000000004
I just don't get I don't get

3693.19 --> 3699.319
[Music]

3696.319 --> 3702.7599999999998
it why people keep doing

3699.319 --> 3706.079
that like why is there a pile of people

3702.76 --> 3707.5200000000004
out there heaping up doing the same

3706.079 --> 3710.6800000000003
troll

3707.52 --> 3713.88
[ __ ] why are you building a wall against

3710.68 --> 3716.68
one freaking individual here this is

3713.88 --> 3718.7200000000003
really weird weird like I'm literally

3716.68 --> 3722.16
one

3718.72 --> 3722.16
guy at this

3724.599 --> 3730.48
point why are you all like trying to

3727.279 --> 3730.48
build a wall against

3733.4 --> 3736.88
me I don't get

3740.44 --> 3745.2000000000003
it like do you think it's going to work

3743.599 --> 3748.3590000000004
anytime soon

3745.2 --> 3751.24
also like I mean there were trolls

3748.359 --> 3753.0389999999998
thinking that they could do that like

3751.24 --> 3756.0789999999997
eight years

3753.039 --> 3757.5200000000004
ago do I need to remind you that I'm

3756.079 --> 3760.88
still

3757.52 --> 3760.88
here doing

3766.119 --> 3769.52
it because I'm

3773.16 --> 3778.72
headstrong yeah

3775.76 --> 3780.44
but I like to be headstrong under very

3778.72 --> 3784.52
specific conditions though and that is

3780.44 --> 3784.52
that it doesn't lead to a bunch of

3793.24 --> 3798.9199999999996
Destruction like I'm not going to be

3796.559 --> 3803.3590000000004
headstrong

3798.92 --> 3805.64
about destruction basically like I try

3803.359 --> 3808.88
to not be like that that it's already

3805.64 --> 3812.96
like in there with the rage win is like

3808.88 --> 3816.44
problematic for me like that I am

3812.96 --> 3820.839
headstrong is a

3816.44 --> 3823.2000000000003
real is very difficult on me when I go

3820.839 --> 3823.2
rage

3828.24 --> 3836.0
wi so I I try to

3831.68 --> 3839.0
always keep my rage and my head head

3836.0 --> 3839.0
strength

3839.079 --> 3845.88
apart cuz really when I go rwin it's all

3842.079 --> 3848.52
about just let like throw it out be

3845.88 --> 3850.279
honest about it and then let it go see

3848.52 --> 3853.119
if you can still get some insights from

3850.279 --> 3855.079
within it but always about letting it go

3853.119 --> 3857.839
but yeah being headstrong is all about

3855.079 --> 3857.8390000000004
not letting it

3858.48 --> 3863.079
go I can't combine that it's very

3863.2 --> 3866.2
dangerous

3868.4 --> 3877.119
fresh dusting of snow

3872.599 --> 3880.44
huh oh you got a beautiful

3877.119 --> 3880.44
landscape that's

3893.16 --> 3898.839
nice right but I mean blue pill

3896.0 --> 3901.24
Evolution yeah it's it's complicated you

3898.839 --> 3904.96
know but yeah it's Arwin so not

3901.24 --> 3904.9599999999996
surprising it's like I

3905.2 --> 3913.24
am very reasonable but I'm also very

3909.799 --> 3915.96
headr strong it's a very weird call me

3913.24 --> 3918.24
cuz usually that's not

3915.96 --> 3921.2400000000002
associated people that are headstrong

3918.24 --> 3923.0789999999997
often like they go just they keep going

3921.24 --> 3926.4399999999996
and into

3923.079 --> 3926.44
nonsense for

3926.48 --> 3930.079
nothing I don't do

3931.44 --> 3938.0
that I'm just holding on to certain

3934.839 --> 3941.599
things that people are like no don't do

3938.0 --> 3943.76
that like no no but it has a

3941.599 --> 3945.92
purpose I'm choosing that very

3943.76 --> 3948.96
specifically it's like every time I do

3945.92 --> 3951.16
something it's like now I'm doing

3948.96 --> 3955.839
something that I know I will have to

3951.16 --> 3958.24
defend against a demonic hord of people

3955.839 --> 3959.52
that are only interesting in tearing

3958.24 --> 3962.72
everything

3959.52 --> 3964.92
down so it's like oh every step I take

3962.72 --> 3967.3999999999996
it's like oh are you ready to defend

3964.92 --> 3970.4
this step for the rest of your

3967.4 --> 3970.4
life

3973.96 --> 3978.88
yeah took me a while to get to that

3976.52 --> 3978.88
point

3981.44 --> 3987.799
though right but I can't allow anything

3984.52 --> 3990.24
to come out that I wouldn't be able to

3987.799 --> 3993.72
justify something comes out that I can't

3990.24 --> 3995.1189999999997
justify then I have a problem and I have

3993.72 --> 3998.24
to

3995.119 --> 4001.2400000000002
like take it a layer

3998.24 --> 4003.68
outside of that situation and like

4001.24 --> 4006.0389999999998
completely adjust this it's like there's

4003.68 --> 4007.0389999999998
something I cannot account for I have to

4006.039 --> 4011.2000000000003
now

4007.039 --> 4013.0
re re-engineer how I do things to

4011.2 --> 4014.3399999999997
account for

4013.0 --> 4017.2
it

4014.34 --> 4018.599
[Music]

4017.2 --> 4019.9199999999996
yeah but that sort of thing doesn't

4018.599 --> 4024.0
happen

4019.92 --> 4028.6800000000003
easily because most things that I do do

4024.0 --> 4032.079
out there I'm very well aware and it is

4028.68 --> 4034.799
accounted for like I already know the

4032.079 --> 4039.2000000000003
influences it might have and how I would

4034.799 --> 4039.2
respond to responses to

4040.359 --> 4045.839
it it's like every sometimes I in this

4043.52 --> 4047.839
flow that every word I that rolls out of

4045.839 --> 4049.0789999999997
me like I know how people are going to

4047.839 --> 4052.92
respond to

4049.079 --> 4054.6800000000003
it I can almost like see it the

4052.92 --> 4056.039
different typ like there's several

4054.68 --> 4059.359
people just blah blah blah blah blah

4056.039 --> 4060.44
blah blah within the silence I can just

4059.359 --> 4063.0
see

4060.44 --> 4066.0
[Music]

4063.0 --> 4066.0
it

4066.4 --> 4073.319
predicted because

4069.24 --> 4076.0789999999997
people's paths the response roots that

4073.319 --> 4078.24
people shoes are really not that unique

4076.079 --> 4078.2400000000002
you

4083.359 --> 4087.319
know right and especially with people

4085.799 --> 4089.0389999999998
that think they're special boys that

4087.319 --> 4090.2
they think that they are like better

4089.039 --> 4093.1600000000003
than

4090.2 --> 4095.839
others like per

4093.16 --> 4098.759
definition or based on some Faith or

4095.839 --> 4101.2789999999995
something they become very

4098.759 --> 4104.6
predictable because that pattern is not

4101.279 --> 4107.159000000001
unique at all so the more unique you

4104.6 --> 4107.159000000001
think you

4107.719 --> 4112.12
are the more predictable you

4113.319 --> 4118.400000000001
become isn't that ironic very

4121.159 --> 4132.799
true I'm going to put that in the

4123.95 --> 4133.898999999999
[Music]

4132.799 --> 4145.5199999999995
title

4133.899 --> 4149.0
[Music]

4145.52 --> 4149.0
P fits

4162.719 --> 4165.719
perfectly

4169.44 --> 4173.0
that's a humbling thought isn't it

4176.359 --> 4185.120000000001
yes it's it's in a way like a a fluid

4181.679 --> 4189.64
Paradox not literally Paradox it's just

4185.12 --> 4189.64
like wherever you're going to be at it's

4189.719 --> 4195.08
like

4192.52 --> 4198.96
so if if you just don't think you're

4195.08 --> 4201.199
unique you will be more unique but then

4198.96 --> 4203.199
by being more unique people will tell

4201.199 --> 4205.719
you you're unique then you will start

4203.199 --> 4207.239
thinking that you are unique and then

4205.719 --> 4209.64
because you start thinking you are

4207.239 --> 4213.36
unique you become more

4209.64 --> 4215.2390000000005
predictable so it's like an a never

4213.36 --> 4218.28
ending back and forth

4215.239 --> 4222.678999999999
Chase unless you're just

4218.28 --> 4226.639999999999
set in a very specific point and don't

4222.679 --> 4226.64
let anything out there influence

4227.36 --> 4232.48
you empowering I'll be on my guard

4230.239 --> 4234.759999999999
against

4232.48 --> 4237.599999999999
it well

4234.76 --> 4238.6
you you don't is not saying like oh it's

4237.6 --> 4241.8
a

4238.6 --> 4244.0
sin like and at that well yeah thinking

4241.8 --> 4245.52
that you're like always better than

4244.0 --> 4248.6
everybody else

4245.52 --> 4251.96
specifically which is like special boy

4248.6 --> 4255.4400000000005
syndrome that is bad obviously because

4251.96 --> 4258.32
you're literally dehumanizing

4255.44 --> 4262.04
others right saying they're less than

4258.32 --> 4265.36
you that's very specific but in general

4262.04 --> 4268.08
like if you have unique traits that's

4265.36 --> 4270.28
not bad I mean it it doesn't really it's

4268.08 --> 4271.48
not a sin to think that you're unique

4270.28 --> 4274.92
it's just

4271.48 --> 4279.159
that the activity of of thinking like

4274.92 --> 4282.88
that will make you become more

4279.159 --> 4285.719
predictable that's like a really bizarre

4282.88 --> 4288.0
it's like a corner of of your

4285.719 --> 4292.04
Consciousness like your Consciousness

4288.0 --> 4295.44
like will not want to recognize that in

4292.04 --> 4297.4
a way it's like your Consciousness is

4295.44 --> 4299.159
going to feel tricked by your

4297.4 --> 4301.92
realization like

4299.159 --> 4303.96
that because there's nothing you can do

4301.92 --> 4306.56
you can't have a default position to

4303.96 --> 4306.56
correct for

4309.56 --> 4316.639
it so it's just

4312.32 --> 4319.5599999999995
like my solution is like no no I am

4316.639 --> 4325.4400000000005
fairly unique but I'm not completely

4319.56 --> 4329.159000000001
unique but I have a fair unique set of

4325.44 --> 4331.4
abilities like an unusual combination

4329.159 --> 4334.32
but all those abilities are absolutely

4331.4 --> 4337.32
not unique on their own it's the

4334.32 --> 4337.32
combination of it

4338.239 --> 4344.638999999999
all and that's how I approach it in that

4342.88 --> 4347.679
way when you think about it like that

4344.639 --> 4350.4800000000005
you kind of bypass the whole back and

4347.679 --> 4350.4800000000005
forth

4353.4 --> 4359.48
influence and you get a lot of people

4355.92 --> 4363.4
that just like really can't stand you

4359.48 --> 4365.718999999999
forever apparently that's also happening

4363.4 --> 4365.719
out

4369.76 --> 4375.4400000000005
there you want to avoid fully in your

4372.6 --> 4375.4400000000005
actions

4379.28 --> 4381.48
all

4383.4 --> 4388.239
right oh it's a difficult one I have

4386.56 --> 4390.96
that issue fully in your actions you

4388.239 --> 4395.4
want to avoid it but you got to realize

4390.96 --> 4399.36
never forget that making mistakes which

4395.4 --> 4401.799999999999
is you could think of it as

4399.36 --> 4404.799999999999
Folly you

4401.8 --> 4408.679
know but is it

4404.8 --> 4412.719
like if you dedicate yourself on being

4408.679 --> 4414.84
useful about things then you should

4412.719 --> 4418.84
eventually reach a point where you

4414.84 --> 4421.4800000000005
become incapable of folly because no

4418.84 --> 4424.76
matter what you do you'll find something

4421.48 --> 4426.839999999999
constructing within it or educational or

4424.76 --> 4429.4400000000005
something that you can develop further

4426.84 --> 4430.88
refine further like no matter what you

4429.44 --> 4433.879999999999
do even if it's

4430.88 --> 4437.28
just taking a break

4433.88 --> 4439.679
or just like I need a lazy day like

4437.28 --> 4441.679
really yeah so how what are you actually

4439.679 --> 4444.32
doing then with the lazy day what are

4441.679 --> 4447.36
you doing why does that work you can

4444.32 --> 4449.32
study those days to see why it was that

4447.36 --> 4451.839999999999
you actually needed that what you end up

4449.32 --> 4451.84
doing with

4452.52 --> 4459.0
it if you think of it like everything is

4455.6 --> 4461.84
dynamic and Ever Changing

4459.0 --> 4463.84
then then you avoid Folly because you

4461.84 --> 4467.76
keep ever developing

4463.84 --> 4471.04
every break you take will become more

4467.76 --> 4473.52
effective and like you will find work

4471.04 --> 4475.92
within the break and you will find a

4473.52 --> 4478.120000000001
break within the work and then

4475.92 --> 4482.76
everything becomes like a giant complex

4478.12 --> 4486.92
fractal of micro breaks and micro work

4482.76 --> 4486.92
all entangled through each

4488.8 --> 4494.56
other and then to an outsider they won't

4492.48 --> 4496.48
even see how you're taking a break to

4494.56 --> 4500.080000000001
them it will just look like you're just

4496.48 --> 4504.5199999999995
working forever right now what I just

4500.08 --> 4508.719
sketched is like a rough system of like

4504.52 --> 4511.0
how you can always keep developing

4508.719 --> 4513.159
whatever you're doing but you got to

4511.0 --> 4514.639
make up your mind about it that you

4513.159 --> 4517.4
always have to do it you have to be

4514.639 --> 4521.679
neurotic about it in a

4517.4 --> 4525.04
way because if you just surrender to

4521.679 --> 4529.679
like no I don't want to think I won't

4525.04 --> 4531.84
want I just want to have downtime and

4529.679 --> 4534.719
I'm not going to do

4531.84 --> 4537.12
anything not going to loosen just like I

4534.719 --> 4540.2390000000005
want nothing if you just basically move

4537.12 --> 4542.44
towards I want nothing not develop and

4540.239 --> 4546.4
not growth then

4542.44 --> 4549.48
you unwittingly move towards aramon

4546.4 --> 4551.719
towards depression towards less because

4549.48 --> 4554.959999999999
you don't want the

4551.719 --> 4559.32
hassle this was my big

4554.96 --> 4562.12
problem during my teens is that I just

4559.32 --> 4566.48
didn't want to do all those things like

4562.12 --> 4571.36
I I just had this heels in the sand like

4566.48 --> 4576.5599999999995
no I don't want to do any of this like I

4571.36 --> 4580.5199999999995
I I rejected the entire format of like

4576.56 --> 4582.120000000001
what people seem to be expecting of me

4580.52 --> 4585.120000000001
to

4582.12 --> 4585.12
become

4585.56 --> 4588.1990000000005
and that was a

4589.159 --> 4596.199
problem well practical problem I mean

4592.52 --> 4602.360000000001
it's led to me becoming

4596.199 --> 4602.36
this and arguably poverty sort

4602.48 --> 4607.759999999999
of and that's the that's the problem

4605.159 --> 4609.719
about it about me putting the heels in

4607.76 --> 4612.92
the sand that's where my regrets lies

4609.719 --> 4616.639
like why why did I have to reject why

4612.92 --> 4616.639
did did I have this

4617.4 --> 4624.44
Vision that basically like told me like

4621.76 --> 4627.12
no you have to like reject everything

4624.44 --> 4629.28
you have to like completely stay out of

4627.12 --> 4632.12
like the entire thing because it's all

4629.28 --> 4635.12
going to be completely destroyed like I

4632.12 --> 4638.96
knew it was all going to be completely

4635.12 --> 4642.0
destroyed like 20 years ago Visions dude

4638.96 --> 4644.52
I knew about freaking medical lockdowns

4642.0 --> 4647.32
and

4644.52 --> 4647.320000000001
worse

4647.4 --> 4656.5199999999995
[ __ ] and and the complete insane

4652.84 --> 4660.1990000000005
programming I knew it was going to

4656.52 --> 4662.320000000001
come je guy would tell me that that was

4660.199 --> 4665.719
going to be done

4662.32 --> 4669.12
later in the future the plans were there

4665.719 --> 4672.0
they were already like adapting to do

4669.12 --> 4674.88
that and they were literally like as

4672.0 --> 4677.6
they were conscious ly saying goodbye to

4674.88 --> 4680.1990000000005
the civilization as it was like no we're

4677.6 --> 4684.320000000001
going to completely destroy

4680.199 --> 4686.599999999999
it we're just like in it enjoying their

4684.32 --> 4687.639
coffee at the restaurant whatever and

4686.6 --> 4691.0
they're like yeah we're going to

4687.639 --> 4694.1990000000005
completely destroy everything here it's

4691.0 --> 4699.28
going to be a complete

4694.199 --> 4699.28
nightmare with poverty and

4699.44 --> 4703.759999999999
insanity and and just robberies

4701.84 --> 4708.32
everywhere people [ __ ] on the street

4703.76 --> 4714.400000000001
like they knew it they knew it way back

4708.32 --> 4714.4
then and they wanted it they hated it

4714.8 --> 4718.88
all I was faced with

4719.679 --> 4727.1990000000005
that and I just knew like

4723.639 --> 4731.8
yeah like there's no point in trying to

4727.199 --> 4733.799999999999
like sacrifice all my abilities to like

4731.8 --> 4736.92
entangle with this system that's

4733.8 --> 4737.76
literally going to be destroyed within

4736.92 --> 4740.679
my

4737.76 --> 4743.92
lifetime like what's the point of

4740.679 --> 4743.92
becoming part of

4744.84 --> 4752.6
that that's really where I'm coming

4749.4 --> 4754.32
from and I've like I need to develop I

4752.6 --> 4756.4400000000005
need to develop in something well this

4754.32 --> 4758.88
is what I found I found the Flat Earth I

4756.44 --> 4761.44
found psychology I find out how

4758.88 --> 4764.96
extremely found Spirit mechanics found

4761.44 --> 4767.96
new grounds completely new

4764.96 --> 4772.2390000000005
grounds that I could build on where I

4767.96 --> 4775.84
could see as everything in the world is

4772.239 --> 4780.879999999999
destroyed these things that I talk

4775.84 --> 4783.08
about will live through the

4780.88 --> 4786.08
Transformations and that's why I try to

4783.08 --> 4789.32
focus on these developing this specific

4786.08 --> 4792.4
thing it's like this little corner I'm

4789.32 --> 4795.36
doing this esoteric stuff and all that

4792.4 --> 4797.5199999999995
as I know that everything outside of me

4795.36 --> 4800.08
is going to be completely different and

4797.52 --> 4800.080000000001
inrecognition.org

4823.52 --> 4830.159000000001
make everything

4826.0 --> 4830.159
toxic I knew it was going to

4831.44 --> 4838.159
happen so I'm like I'm going to need to

4835.52 --> 4840.2390000000005
like really Master psychology and like

4838.159 --> 4843.28
how dealing with pressures and Trauma

4840.239 --> 4846.48
and the cognitive dissonance like what

4843.28 --> 4849.96
Illusions do you have why do you have

4846.48 --> 4854.4
them what are the Illusions you believe

4849.96 --> 4857.32
in protecting you from that's how I look

4854.4 --> 4860.28
at those things now yeah if you have an

4857.32 --> 4867.799999999999
illusion what is that illusion

4860.28 --> 4867.8
protecting you from H yeah I can see

4876.32 --> 4885.36
you right so yeah fly in the

4881.639 --> 4887.32
actions how do you build your house on a

4885.36 --> 4890.88
foundation that you

4887.32 --> 4895.239
know will still be

4890.88 --> 4897.4400000000005
there after a while right CU if you know

4895.239 --> 4899.799999999999
that like yeah somewhere in the next 20

4897.44 --> 4902.839999999999
years this place is all going to go down

4899.8 --> 4904.400000000001
in a Mudslide it's inevitable yeah well

4902.84 --> 4906.12
then you're not going to build your

4904.4 --> 4909.12
house there are

4906.12 --> 4909.12
you

4910.12 --> 4916.0
right that's my situation

4913.52 --> 4920.080000000001
I I'm basically now justifying why I

4916.0 --> 4920.08
don't have a working career and why I'm

4920.84 --> 4924.719
poor and I feel

4926.12 --> 4932.76
outraged about it about why I chose it

4931.36 --> 4935.88
about the

4932.76 --> 4938.159000000001
reality that made me choose it and about

4935.88 --> 4941.76
my doubt about all of

4938.159 --> 4943.92
it it's like I am still not very

4941.76 --> 4947.400000000001
satisfied about the whole

4943.92 --> 4950.76
scenario and I am

4947.4 --> 4954.638999999999
seduced by Satan in this case master of

4950.76 --> 4957.8
lies to like doubt about everything that

4954.639 --> 4959.679
I've done like but maybe I was really

4957.8 --> 4962.28
all wrong maybe it was all an illusion

4959.679 --> 4964.84
that they made me think it was like that

4962.28 --> 4967.36
to do this and separate myself from

4964.84 --> 4969.8
society maybe it won't be completely

4967.36 --> 4971.5599999999995
destroyed but I mean it is already

4969.8 --> 4973.96
completely

4971.56 --> 4976.96
destroyed

4973.96 --> 4981.639
people out there and how they deal with

4976.96 --> 4981.639
each other it's not the same

4983.76 --> 4989.4800000000005
anymore just the amount of and I'm not

4986.96 --> 4990.88
even complaining really but the amount

4989.48 --> 4993.48
of

4990.88 --> 4996.04
foreigners that go around

4993.48 --> 4998.0
here they're relatively nice they're not

4996.04 --> 4999.84
like [ __ ] on the streets or like

4998.0 --> 5001.48
picking fights all the

4999.84 --> 5003.04
time

5001.48 --> 5005.638999999999
but

5003.04 --> 5005.639
it is a

5006.76 --> 5010.96
lot and I don't

5011.08 --> 5019.159
recognize Wherever I Go compared to say

5015.239 --> 5019.159
30 years ago I don't recognize it

5020.0 --> 5026.88
anymore and like intellectual

5023.719 --> 5029.4
standards have have completely shifted

5026.88 --> 5033.88
away from what I grew up

5029.4 --> 5036.759999999999
in like in what I grew up I was kind of

5033.88 --> 5040.679
dumb like that's how it felt

5036.76 --> 5043.639
like enthusiasm and this and that but I

5040.679 --> 5047.4800000000005
felt like relatively dumb like I'm

5043.639 --> 5049.96
actually the dumb one in this world I

5047.48 --> 5051.08
thought but I'll get smarter I'll be

5049.96 --> 5054.44
like

5051.08 --> 5055.88
the the Sorceress Apprentice like I I'll

5054.44 --> 5059.4
get better at

5055.88 --> 5061.679
it but then as I took that mission on me

5059.4 --> 5064.0
it's like oh and everybody loses their

5061.679 --> 5067.0
[ __ ] mind and is like oh let's cut

5064.0 --> 5070.0
each other's Jeffs off

5067.0 --> 5070.0
and

5070.04 --> 5076.159
like that's so

5073.0 --> 5080.0
crazy I woke up thought in a world like

5076.159 --> 5080.0
wow everybody's better than

5080.239 --> 5087.239
me at things and I can see it never

5083.679 --> 5089.639
realizing that it's not really normal

5087.239 --> 5091.36
that you can even see that at that age

5089.639 --> 5093.84
at all but I

5091.36 --> 5095.36
could and I thought like everybody's

5093.84 --> 5096.6
better than me I have to really do my

5095.36 --> 5100.119
best to become

5096.6 --> 5104.400000000001
better and then as I'm dedicating to it

5100.119 --> 5104.4
and time starts to speed up a bit

5104.44 --> 5110.159
more everything around me just

5107.44 --> 5113.599999999999
completely takes a nose dive goes the

5110.159 --> 5117.5199999999995
other direction like loses their

5113.6 --> 5120.639
identity their sense of identity so many

5117.52 --> 5124.88
people like the world isn't the same and

5120.639 --> 5128.8
you can't be all that if nobody else

5124.88 --> 5132.04
around you upholds the same standard to

5128.8 --> 5135.04
even be able to recognize what you have

5132.04 --> 5137.8
and how much of your best you've done

5135.04 --> 5139.719
about those details yeah there's nobody

5137.8 --> 5142.159000000001
out there that even cares or even has

5139.719 --> 5143.32
the senses to recognize it how are you

5142.159 --> 5147.799999999999
going to

5143.32 --> 5150.799999999999
like be a refined

5147.8 --> 5150.8
person

5151.28 --> 5157.44
yeah and that knowledge for me has made

5155.36 --> 5161.719
me realize that yeah you think you're

5157.44 --> 5165.48
all that but you are literally nothing

5161.719 --> 5168.159
without another person to connect the

5165.48 --> 5170.718999999999
ark and actually make you

5168.159 --> 5172.599999999999
manifest without another person you

5170.719 --> 5175.84
don't

5172.6 --> 5178.96
manifest so yes even with others you

5175.84 --> 5182.8
manifest how you manifest is unique but

5178.96 --> 5185.84
it's like a two G it's a twers game

5182.8 --> 5187.76
like you can't be a personality if

5185.84 --> 5192.360000000001
you're just

5187.76 --> 5194.679
you it requires another person to make

5192.36 --> 5194.679
it

5199.28 --> 5205.4
happen I had no idea of

5202.159 --> 5207.5199999999995
that like how that actually like how

5205.4 --> 5210.32
significant that was when I was much

5207.52 --> 5212.88
younger never realized like yeah you can

5210.32 --> 5215.5199999999995
think you're all that but without

5212.88 --> 5218.56
another individual to complete you and

5215.52 --> 5221.159000000001
to actually allow the subtleties of how

5218.56 --> 5222.6
great you are to manifest you're

5221.159 --> 5225.679
literally

5222.6 --> 5228.639
nothing yeah oh I'm such a top star I

5225.679 --> 5231.52
got a big salary yeah what are you going

5228.639 --> 5234.88
to be without the TVs without your fans

5231.52 --> 5237.360000000001
like cheering for you without your like

5234.88 --> 5240.719
nothing it'll be

5237.36 --> 5244.759999999999
nothing you'll be disoriented like

5240.719 --> 5247.92
what no it's because those people are

5244.76 --> 5253.1990000000005
doing that

5247.92 --> 5253.1990000000005
that you have that other side of

5254.679 --> 5262.2390000000005
them like popular figures that get

5257.679 --> 5267.52
worship they get those people's Soul

5262.239 --> 5267.5199999999995
energy for however they want to use

5268.119 --> 5273.48
it and if you start to BU build your

5270.96 --> 5276.199
entire person and your self-worth system

5273.48 --> 5278.759999999999
from within that then you become

5276.199 --> 5280.4
extremely psychologically dependent on

5278.76 --> 5283.159000000001
your

5280.4 --> 5285.5599999999995
popularity and that will eventually lead

5283.159 --> 5285.5599999999995
to the

5285.92 --> 5292.679
devil because you'll start to manipulate

5289.52 --> 5295.88
in order to achieve popularity and

5292.679 --> 5295.88
manipulation is

5296.119 --> 5304.04
just is what it

5298.199 --> 5304.04
is it's not good it's not honesty

5312.0 --> 5317.679
right hope you guys

5315.239 --> 5320.44
are still following what I'm talking

5317.679 --> 5323.92
about might be a bit heavy on the

5320.44 --> 5327.44
esoterics and going

5323.92 --> 5329.28
through descriptions of states of mind

5327.44 --> 5333.879999999999
and

5329.28 --> 5335.4
feelings it's difficult

5333.88 --> 5339.76
anyway I'm going to take a bite of this

5335.4 --> 5339.759999999999
C before it's all cold again so

5356.67 --> 5359.81
[Music]

5360.92 --> 5363.92
cheers

5364.88 --> 5376.22
[Music]

5381.2 --> 5384.45
[Music]

5390.92 --> 5393.92
h

5399.92 --> 5403.14
[Music]

5409.98 --> 5413.11
[Music]

5415.71 --> 5423.84
[Music]

5420.84 --> 5423.84
for

5437.239 --> 5439.959999999999
yeah that hit the

5443.98 --> 5449.199
[Music]

5446.76 --> 5453.84
spot right

5449.199 --> 5453.839999999999
anyway got it really interesting

5454.88 --> 5460.1990000000005
I mean I really like that it's a very

5456.719 --> 5462.119
arnian esoteric Insight in general the

5460.199 --> 5464.239
more unique you are the more predictable

5462.119 --> 5467.32
you

5464.239 --> 5469.5199999999995
become and on top of that doesn't fit in

5467.32 --> 5469.5199999999995
the

5470.719 --> 5476.04
title

5473.04 --> 5477.92
that the idea that you are like an

5476.04 --> 5481.0
isolated

5477.92 --> 5483.76
power without other people is really

5481.0 --> 5483.76
delusional

5486.88 --> 5490.4400000000005
that you can

5490.679 --> 5497.2390000000005
develop and become really large and big

5494.04 --> 5500.92
and capable and

5497.239 --> 5500.919999999999
interesting without other

5501.119 --> 5507.48
people right it's almost like this

5503.6 --> 5510.2390000000005
solipsistic mindset that oh everybody's

5507.48 --> 5513.759999999999
just useless eaters I know so I'm better

5510.239 --> 5513.759999999999
than them

5514.119 --> 5519.759999999999
well are they when you practically check

5517.199 --> 5522.04
those people out study them like no they

5519.76 --> 5522.04
are

5523.88 --> 5529.92
not they believe in a

5526.4 --> 5533.0
lie it's wrong and so believing in a lie

5529.92 --> 5536.159
like that it drains them it

5533.0 --> 5538.32
oversimplifies them it makes them not

5536.159 --> 5540.679
develop in certain ways because of a

5538.32 --> 5543.679
false

5540.679 --> 5543.679
View

5545.639 --> 5551.679
I

5546.84 --> 5551.679
never thought I don't need other people

5552.28 --> 5559.5199999999995
though my problem was is that I felt too

5556.239 --> 5561.44
dependent on other people even but I

5559.52 --> 5563.8
always recognized like yeah my power

5561.44 --> 5566.5599999999995
really comes from connecting up with

5563.8 --> 5567.92
other people a lot of my intellectual

5566.56 --> 5570.119000000001
things that I

5567.92 --> 5573.6
do I do it

5570.119 --> 5575.4
here because I I am in contact with you

5573.6 --> 5578.0
even though I can't see your

5575.4 --> 5581.28
faces I know you're present I know your

5578.0 --> 5582.88
mind is there I know how you tend to

5581.28 --> 5584.88
respond what you're going to be thinking

5582.88 --> 5590.04
about

5584.88 --> 5590.04
roughly and because of all that

5591.119 --> 5597.88
stimulant how I manifest becomes

5594.719 --> 5599.92
more it becomes more because I there's

5597.88 --> 5603.04
more

5599.92 --> 5606.76
attention and that's like power I have

5603.04 --> 5608.679
and it it works with other people it

5606.76 --> 5609.84
only works with other people like when

5608.679 --> 5613.2390000000005
I'm on my

5609.84 --> 5616.360000000001
own I'm not

5613.239 --> 5618.159
talking almost nothing unless I'm like

5616.36 --> 5620.679
really frustrated and then might curse

5618.159 --> 5624.32
or something like a this shitty thing do

5620.679 --> 5629.56
this do that do what I say damn

5624.32 --> 5632.5599999999995
it but I'm like not very

5629.56 --> 5636.080000000001
chatty but when there's other people

5632.56 --> 5639.04
around then as I try to figure them out

5636.08 --> 5639.04
I become

5647.52 --> 5653.8
chatty like on my own I'm kind of a

5651.56 --> 5656.8
quiet guy like a Hermit but if there's

5653.8 --> 5658.92
other people then it gets starting up

5656.8 --> 5660.08
and then I become a blabber mouth that

5658.92 --> 5662.639
never stops

5660.08 --> 5665.36
talking I mean even have this weird

5662.639 --> 5666.88
issue with my roommates and they're all

5665.36 --> 5669.839999999999
great and they have no problem with me

5666.88 --> 5671.92
thank God but then I'm like oh walking I

5669.84 --> 5674.2390000000005
feel like talking and then I'm like

5671.92 --> 5677.52
going to talk almost to this level that

5674.239 --> 5681.119
I do here at the early bird show with

5677.52 --> 5683.8
heavy esoterics and all that with a lot

5681.119 --> 5687.4
of enthusiasm and

5683.8 --> 5690.84
energy but really Tinker Tailor to the

5687.4 --> 5692.638999999999
individual that I'm then talking to

5690.84 --> 5695.360000000001
because I can they're right in front of

5692.639 --> 5698.36
me I can adapt the entire thing of of

5695.36 --> 5701.04
how I process and communicate

5698.36 --> 5704.04
specifically through their frequency so

5701.04 --> 5706.56
it's like Tinker Taylor adapted to them

5704.04 --> 5708.119
specifically that I'm rolling out the

5706.56 --> 5710.8
esoterics I'm rolling them out

5708.119 --> 5714.36
specifically to try to make it

5710.8 --> 5716.6
understood for them

5714.36 --> 5720.48
individually I don't have that luxury

5716.6 --> 5722.4800000000005
right here but I almost do it because

5720.48 --> 5725.678999999999
what I'm going to roll out it really

5722.48 --> 5728.759999999999
does depend on who do I see what names

5725.679 --> 5728.76
do I see in the

5729.8 --> 5733.04
chat it

5733.239 --> 5738.759999999999
matters like every one of your names is

5736.04 --> 5741.199
like a a light bulb of a very specific

5738.76 --> 5743.8
type of light and

5741.199 --> 5747.96
frequency

5743.8 --> 5750.400000000001
and what is there to

5747.96 --> 5754.04
see

5750.4 --> 5756.159
determines what I'm gonna roll out so if

5754.04 --> 5756.92
I only see a bunch of sock trolls that

5756.159 --> 5758.839999999999
are

5756.92 --> 5761.6
whining yeah that's gonna have a

5758.84 --> 5764.0
completely different influence on me

5761.6 --> 5766.159000000001
looking at the board looking at the live

5764.0 --> 5767.48
chat box for just for the names not even

5766.159 --> 5769.799999999999
what you're talking about it's going to

5767.48 --> 5772.799999999999
have a very different response to seeing

5769.8 --> 5774.8
that than to seeing blue pill Devolution

5772.8 --> 5778.4400000000005
and seeking star water and steamy

5774.8 --> 5778.4400000000005
traveler and here we go again in my

5780.32 --> 5783.32
chat

5787.239 --> 5792.48
so in a way your presence even in the

5790.32 --> 5794.679
chat even a bunch of

5792.48 --> 5798.839999999999
text as your

5794.679 --> 5802.08
representative has like a a direct

5798.84 --> 5806.360000000001
influence on how I

5802.08 --> 5806.36
manifest how I how I

5807.4 --> 5813.199
communicate but how that works is very

5810.48 --> 5815.48
intuitive I can't just like tell you oh

5813.199 --> 5819.919999999999
this is the exact system of how that

5815.48 --> 5819.919999999999
works no it's very

5821.8 --> 5828.52
feely I could describe like how I would

5826.159 --> 5830.799999999999
roughly analyze and experience it but I

5828.52 --> 5833.84
could never like give you any specific

5830.8 --> 5833.84
values to any of

5834.239 --> 5838.879999999999
it because I just don't know how to size

5837.119 --> 5841.5199999999995
it up properly I just know hey there's a

5838.88 --> 5843.92
certain energy reaction I have to

5841.52 --> 5843.92
certain

5846.0 --> 5853.119
individuals like you're the

5848.56 --> 5857.4800000000005
spark to my Wick in that

5853.119 --> 5859.679
sense you being in the chat is is like

5857.48 --> 5859.678999999999
the

5860.04 --> 5867.599
lighter and I'm I'm the gas I'm the gas

5864.119 --> 5867.598999999999
and you're setting me a

5870.199 --> 5873.199
blaze

5873.599 --> 5878.599
or the wake of the candle

5875.88 --> 5883.1990000000005
right but it

5878.599 --> 5887.4400000000005
is two people or me and you

5883.199 --> 5887.44
guys that's what's making this

5887.679 --> 5891.88
happen like what I'm doing right now it

5890.56 --> 5897.0
wouldn't

5891.88 --> 5897.0
work if it was just me recording

5897.44 --> 5901.839999999999
myself right like how mad Quantum of

5899.84 --> 5904.52
conscious does it

5901.84 --> 5907.599
he's just doing it on his own like his

5904.52 --> 5910.92
like really his internal world and all

5907.599 --> 5914.360000000001
the comments All it barely comes into

5910.92 --> 5918.4400000000005
it only when he feels

5914.36 --> 5920.92
like responding to things but for me how

5918.44 --> 5924.799999999999
I roll this out

5920.92 --> 5927.2390000000005
live it's an very dependent process on

5924.8 --> 5927.2390000000005
who's

5928.0 --> 5933.119
there who there to complete the AR

5937.159 --> 5943.44
Mark to be the other pole for the

5940.679 --> 5943.4400000000005
electric

5944.719 --> 5949.719
arc when aumu shows up you're liquid

5947.8 --> 5951.56
nitrogen not talking about which I think

5949.719 --> 5952.679
I still have him banned I I'm going to

5951.56 --> 5955.35
unban

5952.679 --> 5958.539
him good that you mention

5955.35 --> 5958.539000000001
[Music]

5960.04 --> 5965.5199999999995

he's like two days in the hole that's

5965.52 --> 5968.280000000001
that's far

5974.57 --> 5977.938999999999
[Music]

5978.28 --> 5982.119
enough all right there you

5985.32 --> 5992.84

6047.239 --> 6052.299999999999
that Nathan's computer's still down I

6049.44 --> 6054.199
wonder how long it's going to take

6052.3 --> 6056.599
[Music]

6054.199 --> 6059.48
but in the meantime you can definitely

6056.599 --> 6059.4800000000005
come over here

6064.599 --> 6069.639
and and try to convince me that the

6067.119 --> 6071.88
Earth is a ball after all if you really

6069.639 --> 6071.88
want

6079.84 --> 6082.84
to

6084.159 --> 6089.638999999999
just don't go full akumu virus on

6087.28 --> 6092.199
me oh and akumu virus if you're

yeah Rich G you can still do that you

6120.28 --> 6123.42
[Music]

6132.04 --> 6139.08
know Akuma virus does a decent sinatro

6136.119 --> 6142.759999999999
cringeworthy cultural appropriation how

6139.08 --> 6142.76
dare you

6159.96 --> 6166.8
aumu hey I never said that doing silly

6163.76 --> 6169.639
accents like Indian or African or I

6166.8 --> 6173.28
never said that it isn't that is

6169.639 --> 6175.96
completely non cringe or anything like

6173.28 --> 6179.8
yeah it might be a little sometimes it

6175.96 --> 6181.92
won't roll out as funny or whatever or

6179.8 --> 6183.56
be flubbing or me messing it up yeah it

6181.92 --> 6186.4400000000005
can be a bit embarrassing I'm not saying

6183.56 --> 6189.360000000001
that oh my God it's like the ultimate

6186.44 --> 6193.239
thing I'm just

6189.36 --> 6193.239
saying I like doing

6193.84 --> 6199.88
it I do

6196.639 --> 6203.04
voices yeah when I was at home most of

6199.88 --> 6206.08
the time like during my entire teens and

6203.04 --> 6210.679
pre-teens you know what I was doing

6206.08 --> 6214.159
voices all the time My Brother and Me

6210.679 --> 6217.719
communicated more through silly voices

6214.159 --> 6219.92
than we would actually talk like we

6217.719 --> 6222.8
still haven't set that straight like we

6219.92 --> 6225.159
still in overall amounts of time that we

6222.8 --> 6227.96
talk talked more through silly voices

6225.159 --> 6227.96
then through actual

6229.679 --> 6235.639
communication

6231.84 --> 6235.639
and then eventually we kind of stopped

6240.719 --> 6245.44
talking cuz I was very different then

6243.679 --> 6247.84
like I was very different where my

6245.44 --> 6252.0
mindset was I was much more of a

6247.84 --> 6254.32
hippie I was much more naive and like no

6252.0 --> 6257.119
I just refuse to believe that things are

6254.32 --> 6259.599
that evil that was my mindset and that

6257.119 --> 6261.799999999999
made it all work much more

6259.599 --> 6264.719
smoothly

6261.8 --> 6264.719
made me a lot more

6265.04 --> 6272.84
happy but yeah then I eventually stopped

6269.28 --> 6275.88
being that naive with a lot of grief I'm

6272.84 --> 6277.32
still dealing with but since I've done

6275.88 --> 6280.88
that it's

6277.32 --> 6283.679
like I've changed so much that almost

6280.88 --> 6286.4800000000005
everybody that knew me during my teens

6283.679 --> 6286.4800000000005
and and before

6288.4 --> 6294.799999999999
that they're all kind of alien

6291.08 --> 6298.04
from me like nobody contacts me like

6294.8 --> 6298.04
they're for

6317.639 --> 6323.4800000000005
real but it's because I'm such a

6319.96 --> 6325.96
contrast with who I used to be I used to

6323.48 --> 6327.799999999999
be the guy that's like no no everything

6325.96 --> 6330.88
will always be all right everything is

6327.8 --> 6333.679
always good real evil is not doesn't

6330.88 --> 6333.679
exist it's just a

6337.36 --> 6343.239
mistake but as I was growing older

6340.48 --> 6346.36
eventually certain people ran into me

6343.239 --> 6349.28
and they did not take kindly to me

6346.36 --> 6352.598999999999
having that view they were like no evil

6349.28 --> 6354.8
is not a mistake mistake it's a choice

6352.599 --> 6357.4800000000005
and it's the right choice and you're

6354.8 --> 6357.4800000000005
wrong about

6363.8 --> 6372.320000000001
everything and they challenged me and my

6366.52 --> 6372.320000000001
mindset and in a way they did break

6373.44 --> 6383.919999999999
[Music]

6378.52 --> 6383.92
it but since then is just I'm very

6385.56 --> 6392.679
different my family I think overall sees

6389.04 --> 6397.0
me as a troubled person even though I

6392.679 --> 6399.21
am like absolute zero criminal

6397.0 --> 6401.76
record absolute

6399.21 --> 6405.76
[Music]

6401.76 --> 6409.400000000001
zero I've never even assaulted a person

6405.76 --> 6412.280000000001
including people that insult

6409.4 --> 6414.04
me

6412.28 --> 6416.8
except in school but I mean no that's

6414.04 --> 6419.4
not true and it's never an assault it's

6416.8 --> 6422.1990000000005
always like

6419.4 --> 6424.5599999999995
self-defense like one

6422.199 --> 6428.799999999999
guy like burnt

6424.56 --> 6432.4400000000005
me he just pushed me into a solder

6428.8 --> 6435.04
iron and that really hurt and then I

6432.44 --> 6438.04
basically in a very short time SP went

6435.04 --> 6440.4
berserk and did like a a Flurry of Blows

6438.04 --> 6442.199
to his chest and then he just fell over

6440.4 --> 6446.08
cuz you couldn't get any

6442.199 --> 6448.08
breath like that's and I was in freaking

6446.08 --> 6451.199
school I was

6448.08 --> 6455.36
like 15 or

6451.199 --> 6458.28
16 and that's like the last time that I

6455.36 --> 6462.4
even did anything like that ever I

6458.28 --> 6462.4
didn't really need to after that

6467.84 --> 6472.400000000001
either and especially as I got more more

6470.56 --> 6474.88
towards like black

6472.4 --> 6479.44
clothes it's really the trick of like

6474.88 --> 6481.88
wearing black and not look gay that's

6479.44 --> 6484.36
tough cuz there's Goths out there and

6481.88 --> 6485.88
they're like oh you you do makeup on

6484.36 --> 6488.199
even though they're guys and oh that's

6485.88 --> 6490.4400000000005
all very special or androgenic or

6488.199 --> 6493.36
whatever I was sort of into that I

6490.44 --> 6496.638999999999
thought it was kind of cool back then

6493.36 --> 6499.839999999999
because weird not because oh that's gay

6496.639 --> 6502.2390000000005
I didn't even see it like that I didn't

6499.84 --> 6504.639
have any any association with sexuality

6502.239 --> 6506.759999999999
with it it's just like no we're just

6504.639 --> 6511.159000000001
different we're aliens or something

6506.76 --> 6513.8
we're not as everyone else a special oh

6511.159 --> 6513.799999999999
liberal

6513.92 --> 6519.92
special but I didn't see it like a Marx

6516.56 --> 6519.92
just like no I'm just going to be

6524.119 --> 6531.08
different but as long as

6527.48 --> 6532.4
she just kind of

6531.08 --> 6536.28
the way that I

6532.4 --> 6538.4
look people don't bother me like they

6536.28 --> 6540.32
don't think they can push me around

6538.4 --> 6542.879999999999
which is very sensible because if you

6540.32 --> 6545.639
see a guy like me especially that's in

6542.88 --> 6547.76
like a letter jacket that's all tethered

6545.639 --> 6550.719
and broken

6547.76 --> 6553.159000000001
up you don't want to mess with people

6550.719 --> 6555.84
that look like that that's very wise of

6553.159 --> 6555.839999999999
you

6559.119 --> 6562.119
yes

6573.56 --> 6578.0
right cuz I'm always super friendly but

6575.92 --> 6580.32
I have this mindset and it's happened

6578.0 --> 6582.159
before like if people would like

6580.32 --> 6584.84
physically assault me because they I

6582.159 --> 6586.44
didn't think I I they like the way I

6584.84 --> 6588.8
looked or they thought that they were a

6586.44 --> 6591.199
special boy and they're better than me

6588.8 --> 6592.639
because they are brown or something and

6591.199 --> 6594.678999999999
I'm

6592.639 --> 6598.32
white

6594.679 --> 6601.4400000000005
bro it's never happened but like I have

6598.32 --> 6603.599
a vicious reflex like oh you're going to

6601.44 --> 6605.638999999999
out of nowhere assault me like I'm going

6603.599 --> 6608.599
to [ __ ] break your

6605.639 --> 6612.599
neck like I'll break your [ __ ] neck

6608.599 --> 6612.599
before I even realize what's

6613.84 --> 6619.2390000000005
happening I'll have like 10 times my

6616.84 --> 6622.1990000000005
normal strength and my muscles and my

6619.239 --> 6624.28
bones will be so afterward but I have

6622.199 --> 6626.919999999999
that in

6624.28 --> 6630.159
me maybe they can feel a bit about me

6626.92 --> 6632.4800000000005
it's like yeah this one is probably

6630.159 --> 6636.5199999999995
better not to mess with him

6632.48 --> 6639.32
really they just do it anonymously

6636.52 --> 6643.2390000000005
psychologically huh through the

6639.32 --> 6643.239
internet that's what you end up

6644.48 --> 6650.799999999999
doing bullies can help yeah but look

6647.679 --> 6653.2390000000005
sometimes bullies are just bored

6650.8 --> 6654.84
and they're like oh look at you but then

6653.239 --> 6656.919999999999
you just have to look at him you just

6654.84 --> 6658.4800000000005
have to play the role of villain and

6656.92 --> 6661.1990000000005
they'll be like all

6658.48 --> 6663.638999999999
excited right A lot of them is just

6661.199 --> 6665.5599999999995
boredom they're just [ __ ] bored

6663.639 --> 6667.56
they're bored with people they're bored

6665.56 --> 6671.04
with how boring people

6667.56 --> 6676.159000000001
are so they're just like oh look at that

6671.04 --> 6676.159
idiot but like they're just

6678.119 --> 6685.48
bored no I'm talking about a a vicious

6681.719 --> 6689.28
reflex to somebody that's like you got

6685.48 --> 6689.28
to go because you're a Whitey or

6693.159 --> 6699.679
something or like if I see them do that

6697.079 --> 6701.5599999999995
to somebody else like that and that

6699.679 --> 6704.639
person is like I don't know how to

6701.56 --> 6704.639
defend myself

6705.56 --> 6712.84
bro yeah

6707.8 --> 6717.159000000001
prepare for like a three three 2 to 3 m

6712.84 --> 6720.52
jumped flying kick to the back

6717.159 --> 6722.679
yeah cuz I'm not [ __ ] accepting I'm

6720.52 --> 6725.1990000000005
going to [ __ ] intimidate the [ __ ] out

6722.679 --> 6728.04
of you if I if I'm close to you and I

6725.199 --> 6733.28
see that you're like

6728.04 --> 6735.119
bullying like that I I hate it so much

6733.28 --> 6736.84
like physical bullying physical

6735.119 --> 6738.639
intimidation especially when they're

6736.84 --> 6741.639
like in a group and they think oh we're

6738.639 --> 6743.88
Invincible I hat when people allow

6741.639 --> 6748.2390000000005
themselves to be possessed by that

6743.88 --> 6748.2390000000005
Spirit I'm like shoot

6754.44 --> 6760.36
them I

6756.56 --> 6764.0
hate like group gangs I hate them they

6760.36 --> 6767.28
should be shot if you do that you hang

6764.0 --> 6768.84
around with people that you know do that

6767.28 --> 6771.84
you deserve to be

6768.84 --> 6771.84
shot

6774.639 --> 6780.92
it's not going to happen of

6776.719 --> 6783.679
course right and since then I see it no

6780.92 --> 6787.76
there's a better way it just it's a test

6783.679 --> 6790.2390000000005
it becomes a God test for anybody yeah

6787.76 --> 6791.96
all those people all going past it all

6790.239 --> 6793.919999999999
seeing it happening it's like oh so

6791.96 --> 6797.56
you're going to pretend you didn't see

6793.92 --> 6799.32
it oh yeah well you just failed God's

6797.56 --> 6801.04
test you're just a miserable [ __ ]

6799.32 --> 6805.48
coward like everybody else and you

6801.04 --> 6807.36
deserve the miserable slow dying fate

6805.48 --> 6810.4
that's going to come for

6807.36 --> 6812.5199999999995
you or you're going to step up and

6810.4 --> 6814.5599999999995
actually like hey I'm not having this

6812.52 --> 6817.56
not in my

6814.56 --> 6819.96
town and then you pass the test and you

6817.56 --> 6819.96
get the

6826.04 --> 6831.76
energy

6828.76 --> 6831.76
right

6839.079 --> 6844.119
right so let me clear up like the whole

6841.76 --> 6846.92
bullying thing you deserve to be shot

6844.119 --> 6848.0
I'm not literal when it comes to that

6846.92 --> 6850.4400000000005
like that's

6848.0 --> 6854.52
ridiculous and I do think that there is

6850.44 --> 6857.5199999999995
something for like hey you want you have

6854.52 --> 6859.76
one or two guys with you because maybe

6857.52 --> 6861.8
you feel really scared or you don't know

6859.76 --> 6865.679
how to compose yourself when you're

6861.8 --> 6867.4800000000005
confronting somebody right it's like but

6865.679 --> 6869.36
that's not the same as like picking on

6867.48 --> 6871.48
somebody that's just kind of weak and

6869.36 --> 6873.44
timid that's

6871.48 --> 6876.759999999999
horrible but

6873.44 --> 6876.759999999999
confrontation yeah I

6877.679 --> 6882.88
mean could be like confronting a bully

6880.28 --> 6886.079
even like hey a bully he's there you

6882.88 --> 6888.0
just like beat the [ __ ] out of that kid

6886.079 --> 6890.159
and then it's like hey you two guys want

6888.0 --> 6892.679
to come with me and not to beat him up

6890.159 --> 6894.679
but to face him like Hey we know you

6892.679 --> 6897.079
beat up that

6894.679 --> 6899.88
kid

6897.079 --> 6903.079
yeah like they might not be reporting

6899.88 --> 6906.36
you to the police but we know you did

6903.079 --> 6910.4
that don't you ever [ __ ] try that

6906.36 --> 6914.159
again or we'll come for you right that's

6910.4 --> 6914.159
that's absolutely

6918.599 --> 6921.599
acceptable

6921.679 --> 6925.0
right so there's definitely something

6923.199 --> 6927.96
for grouping up for

6925.0 --> 6930.159
confrontation but like bullying on the

6927.96 --> 6933.4
week

6930.159 --> 6936.36
I people that have natural tendencies to

6933.4 --> 6941.079
do that like are on my Universal

6936.36 --> 6945.839999999999
execution list yeah it you can't have it

6941.079 --> 6948.4
more diametrically opposed to Christ as

6945.84 --> 6951.599
teaming up to pick on the weak I mean

6948.4 --> 6951.598999999999
that is

6953.32 --> 6959.44
animal and even animals only do it on

6957.8 --> 6963.400000000001
prey they

6959.44 --> 6966.48
eat well human bullies pick on the weak

6963.4 --> 6969.48
not to eat them only to suit their own

6966.48 --> 6974.04
disgusting

6969.48 --> 6974.04
egos that's actually worse than

6978.52 --> 6981.52
animal

6986.56 --> 6992.4400000000005
yeah and it's only as I mean it's

6990.199 --> 6996.598999999999
disgusting it's worse than an

6992.44 --> 6999.879999999999
animal and and the response by Regular

6996.599 --> 7003.04
People just not pretending like it

6999.88 --> 7005.96
doesn't happen is equally

7003.04 --> 7009.48
animal yeah that's the

7005.96 --> 7012.96
rabbit standing still hop is the motion

7009.48 --> 7014.638999999999
won't be detected while another rabbit

7012.96 --> 7018.2390000000005
is getting torn

7014.639 --> 7024.0
apart yeah that's that it's also

7018.239 --> 7024.0
pathetic animal behavior but prey animal

7025.52 --> 7029.56
behavior now you become the

7030.639 --> 7036.52
prey so by that action you

7033.88 --> 7039.84
basically submit the

7036.52 --> 7042.679
victimhood towards the bullies by you

7039.84 --> 7046.04
pretending it's not happening you submit

7042.679 --> 7046.04
to your own

7048.76 --> 7053.599
victimhood probably never thought of it

7051.0 --> 7053.599
like that have

7065.0 --> 7070.88
you oh my God this weather's

7068.4 --> 7073.119
terrible

7070.88 --> 7073.119
right

7074.38 --> 7079.92
[Music]

7076.88 --> 7081.92
anyway yeah big cities breed a lot of

7079.92 --> 7083.4400000000005
people that just watch it it's not even

7081.92 --> 7085.84
The Big C you know what does that

7083.44 --> 7088.32
Richard G it's the

7085.84 --> 7092.159000000001
televisions it's the television that's

7088.32 --> 7095.44
read people to just watch things

7092.159 --> 7098.0
happen yeah and it's kind of interesting

7095.44 --> 7100.5599999999995
when you think about that

7098.0 --> 7103.96
because it's really

7100.56 --> 7108.400000000001
generational yeah a lot of the newer

7103.96 --> 7111.159
Generations don't act like that why

7108.4 --> 7113.04
because they didn't grow up just

7111.159 --> 7115.879999999999
watching the television it's like you

7113.04 --> 7118.239
just have to watch that screen no now

7115.88 --> 7120.52
now you have your own interface and

7118.239 --> 7123.32
you're like I don't want to watch this I

7120.52 --> 7128.320000000001
want to put it on a break I want another

7123.32 --> 7131.079
thing and that makes them less of a dead

7128.32 --> 7133.5599999999995
zombie spectator as those Generations

7131.079 --> 7136.44
that fully grew up watching TV all the

7133.56 --> 7139.1990000000005
time exclusively like only watching the

7136.44 --> 7140.799999999999
television and not having a mobile phone

7139.199 --> 7143.159
or even a

7140.8 --> 7145.079000000001
computer right because those things did

7143.159 --> 7148.0
change things made more interactive and

7145.079 --> 7152.639
when you're more interactive

7148.0 --> 7155.76
with taking in movies or

7152.639 --> 7158.32
whatever then you're also not as

7155.76 --> 7160.079000000001
passive in social situations on the

7158.32 --> 7162.679
street

7160.079 --> 7165.679
so newer Generations are going to be

7162.679 --> 7168.28
like less of spectator passive it is

7165.679 --> 7170.56
really like the older Generations kind

7168.28 --> 7173.8
of my generation and

7170.56 --> 7175.8
older that are really have tendency to

7173.8 --> 7177.96
like ignore things and walk past them

7175.8 --> 7180.2390000000005
which is very shameful because we were

7177.96 --> 7183.599
all growing up with the television and

7180.239 --> 7183.598999999999
that kind of made you do

7187.84 --> 7194.119000000001
that right now of course even with like

7191.92 --> 7197.599
The Mobile

7194.119 --> 7199.32
Generation it can be technically worse

7197.599 --> 7202.4400000000005
can

7199.32 --> 7205.32
be it can be worse in a way that those

7202.44 --> 7207.32
people are even further suspended into

7205.32 --> 7210.28
the whole distraction process of the

7207.32 --> 7212.88
media so bad that they'll literally like

7210.28 --> 7215.44
go on their bicycle staring at their

7212.88 --> 7217.56
mobile as they're on their bicycle which

7215.44 --> 7220.5199999999995
is [ __ ] insane in my opinion to do

7217.56 --> 7224.2390000000005
that like it's it's a miracle not more

7220.52 --> 7228.4400000000005
people die doing that but it

7224.239 --> 7230.36
happens and th they won't even notice

7228.44 --> 7232.759999999999
the bullying happening right next to

7230.36 --> 7235.759999999999
them because they're so caught in that

7232.76 --> 7239.719
screen on the move on their bike

7235.76 --> 7241.76
right it's potentially even worse but

7239.719 --> 7244.0
the point is now it's something else

7241.76 --> 7247.0
it's them being too distracted to notice

7244.0 --> 7249.8
it's not them noticing and then

7247.0 --> 7254.44
pretending it doesn't happen it's a

7249.8 --> 7257.4800000000005
difference cuz what if that kid did

7254.44 --> 7259.5599999999995
notice wasn't in that moment very stuck

7257.48 --> 7261.4
to his mobile while was on the bike or

7259.56 --> 7264.2390000000005
if you would see is a higher chance that

7261.4 --> 7264.239
they would be like

7264.96 --> 7269.52
hey try to get in there and just like

7267.719 --> 7272.079
maybe pretend like they're the friend of

7269.52 --> 7275.4800000000005
the guy being bullied or something try

7272.079 --> 7276.5199999999995
to Diplomat themselves out of it which

7275.48 --> 7278.919999999999
can

7276.52 --> 7279.84
work I've done that even in the past

7278.92 --> 7282.679
like

7279.84 --> 7284.56
just you don't recognize the Hostile

7282.679 --> 7287.88
situation you don't give into fear or

7284.56 --> 7290.119000000001
anger and you just like social maneuver

7287.88 --> 7294.04
your way in and then just like hey we

7290.119 --> 7294.04
need to go there so let's

7294.4 --> 7299.96
go and then they're out of

7296.719 --> 7303.2390000000005
it and younger Generations have a higher

7299.96 --> 7306.44
chance of being able to do that because

7303.239 --> 7308.32
they haven't grown up just staring at

7306.44 --> 7311.36
the television that they didn't even

7308.32 --> 7311.36
have control over over a

7314.04 --> 7320.199
remote cuz that television that the

7317.239 --> 7322.598999999999
period of television in in the 20th

7320.199 --> 7326.04
century all that have sat through that

7322.599 --> 7329.0
like that was a real Pacifier that

7326.04 --> 7333.88
really stopped people

7329.0 --> 7337.88
from it made them useless ghostly

7333.88 --> 7337.88
Spectators that's what it's done to

7337.96 --> 7340.96
them

7346.079 --> 7352.079
right but I mean you you also have of

7349.44 --> 7354.5199999999995
the newer Generations that are even

7352.079 --> 7356.679
worse people that are like oh there's

7354.52 --> 7361.679
violence now oh quickly bring out your

7356.679 --> 7365.76
mobile and film it don't stop it just

7361.679 --> 7365.76
film it like that's also

7366.04 --> 7372.239
terrible there but I mean

7370.04 --> 7374.199
if you'd be caught doing that here in

7372.239 --> 7375.959999999999
the Netherlands just like oh I'm just

7374.199 --> 7378.0
fil you're just filming it as somebody's

7375.96 --> 7382.76
getting beaten to

7378.0 --> 7384.92
death you get Pro in like you're now

7382.76 --> 7387.96
like in trouble because you're basically

7384.92 --> 7387.96
didn't try to stop

7390.84 --> 7396.84
it I

7392.719 --> 7396.84
think I'm not even sure about

7397.88 --> 7403.4800000000005
it

7399.76 --> 7403.4800000000005
wasn't that a SF episode

7410.04 --> 7416.56
what Seinfeld did oh did Seinfeld talk

7413.44 --> 7418.48
about like useless television

7416.56 --> 7421.400000000001
Spectators I wouldn't be surprised I

7418.48 --> 7424.239
mean Seinfeld in his series however

7421.4 --> 7429.96
annoying the characters

7424.239 --> 7433.079
were he did like address things like

7429.96 --> 7436.119
cultural things and that was kind of

7433.079 --> 7438.599
interesting like Seinfeld did actually

7436.119 --> 7438.598999999999
make you

7443.079 --> 7448.04
think I did appreciate Seinfeld when I

7445.84 --> 7448.04
was

7450.8 --> 7455.559
younger but they're so annoying

7457.8 --> 7460.8
though

7473.96 --> 7479.119
oh right they go to jail for not helping

7476.52 --> 7479.119000000001
a guy getting

7487.76 --> 7490.76
mugged

7509.84 --> 7514.719
H what do I think was the best decade oh

7513.44 --> 7520.678999999999
my

7514.719 --> 7520.679
God none of them they're all terrible

7523.92 --> 7527.84
right it all depends on what about

7530.88 --> 7536.119
it if you're going to ask like what are

7533.36 --> 7538.239
you most nostalgic about it is kind of

7536.119 --> 7538.239
the

7538.96 --> 7543.599
80s and it's a very subtle

7545.32 --> 7553.5199999999995
thing it's like the80s to me feels when

7549.44 --> 7555.199
the stuff that was before that pit time

7553.52 --> 7559.679
came to a

7555.199 --> 7561.678999999999
peak and a new Fresh thing just comes in

7559.679 --> 7563.8
and then by it's by the time it's the

7561.679 --> 7566.32
'90s that new fresh thing is already

7563.8 --> 7570.119000000001
kind of ruined it's already getting

7566.32 --> 7573.759999999999
ruined only it got worse after that but

7570.119 --> 7578.04
that's how the 80s feel it's like is the

7573.76 --> 7579.280000000001
the the end like the the Maximus peak of

7578.04 --> 7582.04
an old

7579.28 --> 7586.0
era and the start of a new when it's

7582.04 --> 7586.0
still innocent like that's the

7587.079 --> 7592.159
80s and they said very magical stuff

7590.239 --> 7595.36
about a lot of music there's also a lot

7592.159 --> 7597.96
of stupid gay music too that is very

7595.36 --> 7599.96
gladly forget about it but there's like

7597.96 --> 7604.119
really interesting types of music back

7599.96 --> 7606.119
then and and it's like this this peak in

7604.119 --> 7608.639
development of early stage computer

7606.119 --> 7611.04
Games Etc like there's a lot of very

7608.639 --> 7615.599
very interesting activity that happened

7611.04 --> 7615.599
and develop it in that very specific

7615.96 --> 7624.0
decade so yeah I guess it's the 80s and

7619.04 --> 7624.0
hey I was a little kid back then it

7624.119 --> 7633.199
it I wasn't like super engaged with it

7629.119 --> 7636.598999999999
right because I was just very young but

7633.199 --> 7636.598999999999
afterward it just seemed like

7637.52 --> 7640.52
that

7648.28 --> 7650.599
hold

7659.32 --> 7662.37
[Music]

7667.52 --> 7670.52
on

7674.559 --> 7678.92
all right so does that answer your

7676.079 --> 7678.92
question

7697.44 --> 7700.44
ch

7710.96 --> 7715.0
right I'm going to take a two minute

7712.119 --> 7715.0
break I'll be right

7727.4 --> 7730.4
back

7809.8 --> 7812.92
lot more variety

7814.079 --> 7819.88
yeah I mean I don't even want to like

7817.199 --> 7823.638999999999
try to compare what coming out now it's

7819.88 --> 7823.639
all so [ __ ]

7830.32 --> 7837.719
lame well you know what

7833.88 --> 7837.719
although I think there's

7839.84 --> 7847.88
like M no wait like between 2005 and

7845.28 --> 7850.239
2010 also been a lot of interesting

7847.88 --> 7850.2390000000005
development

7854.679 --> 7861.119
vment but also a lot of crazy corruption

7859.079 --> 7864.84
developments

7861.119 --> 7869.32
though I mean I've heard like music made

7864.84 --> 7869.32
around that time was like very

7870.159 --> 7877.159
interesting like mind in a box is like

7873.48 --> 7881.0
from that time it and it's like it

7877.159 --> 7883.679
is almost like the 80s

7881.0 --> 7887.48
point2 it's

7883.679 --> 7889.4400000000005
like it's good like that but like more

7887.48 --> 7891.32
advanced more

7889.44 --> 7895.199
developed more

7891.32 --> 7898.88
range so there I mean it's not all after

7895.199 --> 7900.839999999999
the 80s is [ __ ] it's just 90s just the

7898.88 --> 7904.4800000000005
corruption started showing

7900.84 --> 7907.159000000001
itself but then yeah the early 2000s and

7904.48 --> 7910.159
all that there were

7907.159 --> 7913.159
like hopeful interesting new

7910.159 --> 7913.159
developments as

7920.239 --> 7925.199
well but yeah those interesting things

7923.28 --> 7926.92
just never got shoved in people's face

7925.199 --> 7929.48
it's all the crap that got shoved in

7926.92 --> 7933.28
everybody's

7929.48 --> 7933.28
face underrated

7936.639 --> 7942.639
yeah listen a song while

7939.96 --> 7946.52
right yeah I mean my song is still

7942.639 --> 7949.76
Between Worlds is still my favorite

7946.52 --> 7949.76
song it's

7953.66 --> 7956.889999999999
[Music]

7967.04 --> 7970.04
fantastic

8008.239 --> 8012.638999999999
right so I think I'm going to move

8010.84 --> 8017.04
towards rounding out the show I've been

8012.639 --> 8017.04
going two hours 11

8020.76 --> 8029.96
minutes I

8023.88 --> 8029.96
think it's been very interesting though

8039.04 --> 8042.679
but yeah maybe I'm like running out of

8040.96 --> 8047.4
esoteric

8042.679 --> 8047.4
energy it's all been very esoteric

8051.48 --> 8056.159
today and and very interesting

8054.28 --> 8059.199
realization the more unique you think

8056.159 --> 8062.799999999999
you are the more predictable you

8059.199 --> 8068.36
come it's just a good thing to

8062.8 --> 8068.360000000001
know Peter M what I don't know who that

8073.48 --> 8077.4
is so I guess that's a

8086.88 --> 8089.88
no

8107.679 --> 8114.84
a Brit oh okay no sorry never heard of

8112.079 --> 8116.799999999999
him there's a lot of British stuff that

8114.84 --> 8119.8
I kind of missed out

8116.8 --> 8119.8
on

8142.239 --> 8149.799999999999
check out okay well link me up l

8146.8 --> 8149.8

the weird I might have actually

8232.679 --> 8238.399
like wait what

8236.08 --> 8241.84
yeah 19

8238.399 --> 8246.8
89 that's very long

8241.84 --> 8246.8
ago I thought it was like an early 2000s

8257.679 --> 8264.92
B hardcore 80s then I probably know

8261.719 --> 8269.598999999998
it I just don't recognize the

8264.92 --> 8269.599
name then I'll probably know the song

8272.24 --> 8277.92
I'm you got to remember like I'm

8273.92 --> 8277.92
terrible with names like

8282.479 --> 8286.519
that right anyway I'll check it

8286.559 --> 8293.639
out but in the meantime I'm rounding out

8290.08 --> 8295.319
the show so thanks everyone for coming I

8293.639 --> 8299.119999999999
hope you like this show I thought it was

8295.319 --> 8301.96
pretty good weird it at the

8299.12 --> 8304.160000000002
beginning but yeah then things basically

8301.96 --> 8307.24
move on and we get all very esoteric

8304.16 --> 8310.439
here and some interesting spiritual

8307.24 --> 8313.439
insights and

8310.439 --> 8316.559000000001
like

8313.439 --> 8319.16
active thinking pondering upon like

8316.559 --> 8320.0
societal attitudes and all that what

8319.16 --> 8323.399
that

8320.0 --> 8326.319
is because the world is changing around

8323.399 --> 8328.92
us it has been my entire

8326.319 --> 8333.399
life and we have to

8328.92 --> 8335.639
master the change or how will you ever

8333.399 --> 8339.199999999999
be able to change it back if you can't

8335.639 --> 8341.08
even Master what it has changed into

8339.2 --> 8342.679
right you'll just be like oh I just wish

8341.08 --> 8345.28
it was like the olden days well you're

8342.679 --> 8348.960000000001
not going to change it that

8345.28 --> 8352.439
