i anyway

126.64 --> 133.92
the weather today is kind of dreary

130.479 --> 134.48000000000002
it's raining on and off but not very

133.92 --> 137.28
hard

134.48 --> 140.23899999999998
it's dripping it's very gray out there

137.28 --> 140.239
not warm at all

140.64 --> 144.64
in a way i'm kind of glad that i don't

142.239 --> 149.59900000000002
have to

144.64 --> 151.67999999999998
well go outside right now

149.599 --> 152.79999999999998
it's kind of sucky weather my door keeps

151.68 --> 156.08
blowing open

152.8 --> 158.31900000000002
very annoying and it takes out the warm

156.08 --> 158.31900000000002
air

158.48 --> 162.0
but uh yeah

162.64 --> 171.83999999999997
it's not really much of a

165.84 --> 171.84
nice weather today but oh well

172.8 --> 176.16000000000003
hello conspiracy cats

178.319 --> 182.319
you have not been sleeping well you say

182.959 --> 189.84
why is that conspiracy cat's actually

187.04 --> 189.84
first in chat

192.0 --> 199.84
my youtube's way behind again for no

196.84 --> 199.84
reason

201.2 --> 206.72
right so yeah my sleeping is still fine

204.239 --> 209.04
is just the waking up part when it gets

206.72 --> 209.04
kind of

210.159 --> 214.72
annoying when i realized where i am at

215.519 --> 222.72
like it seems like as a culmination

219.76 --> 223.35999999999999
my entire financial flexibility has

222.72 --> 226.48
literally

223.36 --> 229.76000000000002
gone to rock bottom right now

226.48 --> 232.79899999999998
rock bottom so

229.76 --> 235.439
yeah i'm gonna probably spend quite a

232.799 --> 240.239
lot of time today

235.439 --> 243.519
emphasizing the need for me to

240.239 --> 246.159
get some support because i like really

243.519 --> 249.28
really need it and this time it's

246.159 --> 252.84
literally for food

249.28 --> 255.84
all right hey hello by the way john m

252.84 --> 255.84
truth

256.079 --> 260.40000000000003
second indeed okay conspiracy catch you

259.28 --> 262.55999999999995
had bad dreams

260.4 --> 264.79999999999995
you have a plan you're going to go on a

262.56 --> 267.6
mission okay that's

264.8 --> 269.199
interesting depends kind of like it's

267.6 --> 271.91900000000004
not very clear as to

269.199 --> 273.6
what that means don't know what your bad

271.919 --> 276.88
dreams were about

273.6 --> 280.84000000000003
and why that set you to a mission

276.88 --> 283.759
uh hello kamikaze uh cameron kamikaze

280.84 --> 285.67999999999995
gilmore

283.759 --> 288.24
rompus probably has a lot of sleeping

285.68 --> 288.24
disorder

290.0 --> 297.84
big dreams small pp hello

300.72 --> 311.84000000000003
all right

312.88 --> 316.88
the answer lies in southport okay well i

315.28 --> 320.08
have no idea what you're on to

316.88 --> 323.52
conspiracy cats this is all very vague

320.08 --> 323.52
but i wish you the best of luck

323.6 --> 327.6
i might try to help you figure it out if

327.199 --> 329.36
you're

327.6 --> 331.199
going to be a little bit more open that

329.36 --> 334.639
would be useful

331.199 --> 339.36
you know because

334.639 --> 343.039
i don't know

339.36 --> 346.24
right i'm seriously considering

343.039 --> 349.28
yeah to basically step away

346.24 --> 352.72
and try to find

349.28 --> 356.479
some kind of way to get into a job

352.72 --> 356.47900000000004
discard like all my

358.08 --> 361.35999999999996
pre-emptive notions

361.759 --> 367.84000000000003
and just hope that i'll somehow get

364.72 --> 367.84000000000003
through it

368.56 --> 375.28000000000003
and even then it's going to be quite

371.68 --> 378.84000000000003
complicated because i literally

375.28 --> 380.15999999999997
have not is i've less than a cent right

378.84 --> 382.479
now

380.16 --> 382.47900000000004
less

387.759 --> 395.84000000000003
so yeah

397.44 --> 400.96
your car isn't good okay

404.479 --> 408.24
no proof courage oh my god conspiracy

407.039 --> 413.599
cat so

408.24 --> 415.919
literally flat earth has kept you awake

413.599 --> 417.199
and you're desperately looking for some

415.919 --> 423.84
curvature that's

417.199 --> 423.84000000000003
really sad

430.24 --> 436.88
all right let's get out of here you too

433.759 --> 438.96000000000004
stupid sock names i know it's you you

436.88 --> 440.8
can come in with a smiley all you want

438.96 --> 443.35999999999996
if you have some stupid name

440.8 --> 444.96000000000004
and some stupid icon you're a troll i

443.36 --> 451.84000000000003
know which show

444.96 --> 451.84
get the [ __ ] out

452.639 --> 457.44
all right well conspiracy cats go and

455.599 --> 462.319
get the shot you need

457.44 --> 462.319
get your shots go get him

463.68 --> 466.8
that's what you need to do

471.68 --> 479.84000000000003
hey aaron armstrong good to see you

486.4 --> 493.84
hey stone monkey 3d

494.16 --> 500.0
all right but as of this point

501.28 --> 507.84
yeah it seems like uh i'm

505.52 --> 508.56
probably not gonna make it to a thousand

507.84 --> 511.67999999999995
shows

508.56 --> 511.68
with the early bird show

519.839 --> 525.839
due to well personal and financial

523.039 --> 525.8389999999999
circumstances

530.8 --> 536.959
my setup would have been different if my

533.36 --> 539.6
crypto situation would have yielded

536.959 --> 542.64
what i had been kind of counting on and

539.6 --> 545.36
that's my mistake

542.64 --> 547.36
oh well is it it was worth a shot you

545.36 --> 550.08
know

547.36 --> 552.16
now if i had the extra finances i could

550.08 --> 553.9200000000001
literally keep this going i would not be

552.16 --> 556.399
as stressed out i would not be as

553.92 --> 561.04
stressed out over

556.399 --> 564.08
getting donations from my supporters

561.04 --> 567.36
and basically in yeah

564.08 --> 570.72
within desperation try to like please

567.36 --> 573.6800000000001
please i need it so much because

570.72 --> 574.88
it's counterproductive it only drags

573.68 --> 578.959
away from

574.88 --> 581.2
actual quality output what i do

578.959 --> 591.8389999999999
but yeah i'm i've ended up in this

581.2 --> 591.839
position and

591.92 --> 597.68
that's it ask riley for a loan really

598.16 --> 601.12
that that's a

602.839 --> 605.839
what

607.92 --> 611.12
that's that's weird

611.2 --> 623.36
what am i gonna do with it

618.16 --> 623.36
like my problem financially is systemic

624.0 --> 627.68
right that's the real problem

628.72 --> 633.6800000000001
no minimum surviving amount in your

630.959 --> 637.3599999999999
country

633.68 --> 637.3599999999999
well yeah

637.519 --> 642.24
but you can barely get by like i lose a

641.36 --> 646.0790000000001
lot of money

642.24 --> 651.12
just for rent and my storage

646.079 --> 651.12
i eat organic it's not super cheap

651.2 --> 655.36
so it's always been kind of tight

656.64 --> 662.959
is it weird buy food with it

660.0 --> 664.64
you know what at this point i might just

662.959 --> 667.68
as well try

664.64 --> 670.959
i really i really should probably

667.68 --> 674.64
because i don't have any choice

670.959 --> 675.8389999999999
used to have a good little network where

674.64 --> 680.079
it can just

675.839 --> 682.8800000000001
move money around and it would work out

680.079 --> 689.8389999999999
but it seems like it's now completely

682.88 --> 689.8389999999999
dead shot

694.079 --> 698.959
but i don't know riley like does he even

697.44 --> 702.32
do that sort of thing what a

698.959 --> 716.4799999999999
strange thing to ask but i don't know

702.32 --> 718.9590000000001
man at this point i will try

716.48 --> 719.9200000000001
well in the meantime i'll just talk

718.959 --> 722.7199999999999
about

719.92 --> 722.7199999999999
flat earth and

723.279 --> 727.68
my views on ancient history and

728.24 --> 735.279
esoterics the spirit mechanics

731.92 --> 738.56
for as long as i can hold out

735.279 --> 745.8389999999999
until basically the early bird show just

738.56 --> 745.8389999999999
comes to an end

756.8 --> 761.92
right although i can barely imagine that

760.399 --> 764.24
i would stay away for too

761.92 --> 767.12
long though it's just that the singular

764.24 --> 770.88
run of having an everyday show

767.12 --> 771.36
like is i can't i don't i don't feel

770.88 --> 787.8389999999999
like

771.36 --> 787.839
i can hold on any longer

788.639 --> 791.6800000000001
what do i know about blackpool tower and

791.279 --> 795.2
why

791.68 --> 797.8389999999999
what not a lot

795.2 --> 798.839
i think some of it got brought up in the

797.839 --> 802.0
period

798.839 --> 815.839
where the flat earth debaters were onto

802.0 --> 815.839
the isle of man a lot

818.72 --> 829.839
what hey rufus and tubbins

822.32 --> 829.839
see i told you you weren't banned

840.839 --> 843.839
hmm

857.6 --> 864.32
my premium is still oh you know what

861.519 --> 867.68
doesn't really matter too much anyway

864.32 --> 885.839
i'll just go and try to unband

867.68 --> 885.8389999999999
and ban your main account as you say

890.639 --> 896.48
ah yeah i found the other one okay

894.639 --> 899.839
well you should be good now he should be

896.48 --> 899.839
able to come on with that

921.6 --> 928.399
how do you reduce noise from wind when

924.639 --> 928.399
filming outside oh that's tough

929.92 --> 941.8389999999999
i think you just need a special type of

931.92 --> 941.8389999999999
microphone cover for that

942.639 --> 955.839
but yeah that doesn't really work on on

944.959 --> 955.8389999999999
mobile phones and all that so

961.279 --> 965.04
buy some xrp i don't know what that is

963.759 --> 967.6800000000001
but thank you john

1021.519 --> 1026.0
click to blockchain exercise

1030.64 --> 1037.1200000000001

1037.12 --> 1044.4799999999998

1040.319 --> 1046.799
maneuverability to buy anything

1056.48 --> 1061.3600000000001
great

1058.24 --> 1064.799
because i've explained it many times due

1061.36 --> 1067.12
to my financial setup

1064.799 --> 1069.44
like the income i get from google which

1067.12 --> 1071.6
includes the super chats it basically it

1069.44 --> 1075.679
arrives very late and it all gets

1071.6 --> 1078.6399999999999
retracted from my income

1075.679 --> 1079.6000000000001

i will shout you out if you tell me

1091.919 --> 1098.4
in my chat like my regular supporters

1095.52 --> 1099.84

1098.4 --> 1109.8400000000001
you donate it and

1099.84 --> 1109.84
basically share it on the spot

1113.52 --> 1117.679
uh john m truth kind of bitcoin yeah i

1115.84 --> 1118.72
know it's it's another cryptocurrency

1117.679 --> 1123.8400000000001
there's many

1118.72 --> 1123.84
many of them

1125.04 --> 1128.079
[Music]

1137.52 --> 1140.8799999999999
right i guess

1142.16 --> 1145.919
in another way there is another way

1147.36 --> 1153.9189999999999
you could also in a more indirectly in

1150.32 --> 1153.9189999999999
an indirect fashion help me

1154.4 --> 1162.48
and that is by

1158.559 --> 1165.52
well joining the crypto

1162.48 --> 1167.2
system that i'm a part of

1165.52 --> 1169.52
although i don't know after everything

1167.2 --> 1170.88
i've said it it probably doesn't sound

1169.52 --> 1174.08
very

1170.88 --> 1174.0800000000002
very encouraging

1174.64 --> 1181.039
but it's still building like it's

1178.0 --> 1183.919
constantly building it's

1181.039 --> 1184.24
it's so complicated to explain it all

1183.919 --> 1187.5200000000002
but

1184.24 --> 1189.679
technically if i would manage to

1187.52 --> 1191.36
find somebody who has some investment

1189.679 --> 1194.72
room for themselves

1191.36 --> 1197.36
just for themselves this right

1194.72 --> 1199.6000000000001
and get it a gti account with everything

1197.36 --> 1202.7199999999998
that comes with it

1199.6 --> 1203.6
then i would basically be put because of

1202.72 --> 1207.3600000000001
that

1203.6 --> 1209.9189999999999
on a priority list so that i can

1207.36 --> 1209.9189999999999
actually

1211.2 --> 1214.559
take money out from the crypto system

1214.08 --> 1218.08
quicker

1214.559 --> 1223.28
a lot quicker because right now

1218.08 --> 1223.28
like they're overloaded with requests

1225.28 --> 1228.48
because there's a lot of people with a

1226.88 --> 1230.4
lot of money that are part of that

1228.48 --> 1232.72
system

1230.4 --> 1235.44
and it's kind of screwing with with the

1232.72 --> 1237.28
market numbers because of that so they

1235.44 --> 1239.6000000000001
had to put on a waiting list to

1237.28 --> 1243.12
stabilize it

1239.6 --> 1245.36
and a way to get a higher priority for

1243.12 --> 1248.4799999999998
withdrawals

1245.36 --> 1252.7199999999998
is by basically adding

1248.48 --> 1252.72
a person to the system

1254.159 --> 1257.3600000000001
i will send some crypto into your wallet

1256.4 --> 1260.159
is

1257.36 --> 1261.52
it's fast sure john m truth the attacker

1260.159 --> 1266.0
work

1261.52 --> 1269.6
but that type you mentioned

1266.0 --> 1273.6
i don't know if what i got

1269.6 --> 1273.6
if that if it's in there

1274.0 --> 1277.84
i'd have to check

1282.72 --> 1291.84
let me check what was it again

1286.6 --> 1291.84
bmx or something

1295.039 --> 1298.96
no i don't see it in a list here

1302.799 --> 1306.799
because i use bit links and has a lot of

1306.159 --> 1309.44
different

1306.799 --> 1319.679
kind of cryptos it uses but i don't see

1309.44 --> 1323.3600000000001
it in there

1319.679 --> 1326.96
right but i i do take ethereum

1323.36 --> 1330.559
bitcoin and litecoin as the

1326.96 --> 1334.32
crypto links in the

1330.559 --> 1334.32
in the description box subscribe

1342.08 --> 1345.28
but yeah if you really want to help me

1344.0 --> 1348.24
out please

1345.28 --> 1350.48
consider using paypal that would work

1348.24 --> 1350.48
best

1355.2 --> 1361.8400000000001

1433.84 --> 1441.4399999999998
i don't exactly know what you mean

1437.6 --> 1441.4399999999998
the basis of mountains

1443.679 --> 1447.919
well i take it they basically run until

1446.88 --> 1450.0
the

1447.919 --> 1452.48
up until the bottom of the container if

1450.0 --> 1454.64
that even exists

1452.48 --> 1456.84
like in a literal sense there's some

1454.64 --> 1459.8400000000001
kind of barrier at some point i don't

1456.84 --> 1459.84
know

1462.66 --> 1465.749
[Music]

1480.159 --> 1484.24

1485.44 --> 1501.8400000000001
good afternoon

1504.32 --> 1515.84
my chat working all right

1526.84 --> 1529.84
hmm

1530.96 --> 1543.8400000000001
right okay that's just cut off naturally

1534.88 --> 1543.8400000000001
through obs all right

1548.72 --> 1554.32
right so anyway yeah open for

1551.52 --> 1554.32
conversation

1554.64 --> 1560.4
although i'm gonna keep on emphasizing

1556.64 --> 1560.4
please donate to my paypal

1561.76 --> 1568.1589999999999
every little bit helps helps me to food

1566.159 --> 1569.3600000000001
on the short run which is the most

1568.159 --> 1585.2
urgent part

1569.36 --> 1588.559
right the short run in this case

1585.2 --> 1590.4
yeah well conspiracy cats that's good

1588.559 --> 1590.8799999999999
that you have that and that worked out

1590.4 --> 1593.919
for you

1590.88 --> 1599.8400000000001
i tried i tried to have it as a source

1593.919 --> 1599.8400000000001
of income

1600.159 --> 1604.3200000000002
and now it's just yeah

1610.559 --> 1613.9189999999999
but yeah that would be great if i had

1613.52 --> 1616.08
some

1613.919 --> 1618.0
other stable income that i wouldn't have

1616.08 --> 1620.48
to worry about finances so i could just

1618.0 --> 1620.48
do this

1620.88 --> 1626.0
just being more focused on the subjects

1624.159 --> 1629.5590000000002
not being so distracted

1626.0 --> 1631.76
or like shining through personal

1629.559 --> 1635.279
demoralization over it

1631.76 --> 1635.279
yeah i know that will be great

1638.48 --> 1644.559
yes i know youtube is not a source of

1640.88 --> 1644.5590000000002
income for you i understand

1645.93 --> 1649.569
[Music]

1741.84 --> 1745.84
a lot for that john m truth really it's

1744.72 --> 1749.1200000000001
the little bits that

1745.84 --> 1750.84
just help a lot give me a bit of my

1749.12 --> 1753.039
breath

1750.84 --> 1756.9599999999998
back

1753.039 --> 1756.96
i hope others will join too

1760.399 --> 1766.9599999999998
it's also because basically

1763.6 --> 1770.799
if i get enough

1766.96 --> 1775.3600000000001
donations through my show today

1770.799 --> 1778.96
then i could basically move well

1775.36 --> 1780.0
last resort i can tell my dad like okay

1778.96 --> 1782.799
i have some coming

1780.0 --> 1784.24
in like in this date can i please borrow

1782.799 --> 1787.44
some money for food

1784.24 --> 1789.76
if i don't have anything to present then

1787.44 --> 1793.679
he won't do it

1789.76 --> 1794.48
and i don't know man with the way things

1793.679 --> 1797.6000000000001
are going

1794.48 --> 1801.1200000000001
i i don't even even guarantee that he

1797.6 --> 1802.9599999999998
will do it even if i did have that

1801.12 --> 1807.039
got this feeling like people want to

1802.96 --> 1810.0
teach me a lesson for my stubbornness

1807.039 --> 1813.52
for holding on to a setup that's just

1810.0 --> 1813.52
not financially viable

1816.64 --> 1819.919
or maybe that's just projection from

1818.799 --> 1823.6
myself maybe

1819.919 --> 1827.5200000000002
that's just me punishing for having

1823.6 --> 1827.52
in my own opinion failed

1833.919 --> 1838.88
anyway appreciate the gesture

1840.399 --> 1846.32
yeah but good luck there conspiracy cats

1844.0 --> 1847.36
you and go find that curvature it's not

1846.32 --> 1851.84
there though it's

1847.36 --> 1851.84
black swan so it's kind of pointless

1862.399 --> 1867.36
but maybe just going out in the field

1864.48 --> 1867.3600000000001
will be good for you

1873.84 --> 1879.84
flat earth volcano how they fake it no

1882.64 --> 1893.8400000000001
they don't they're still volcanoes

1916.159 --> 1935.8400000000001
right let's see what i

1920.0 --> 1935.84
have note wise

1946.84 --> 1949.84
right

1953.76 --> 1959.279
what's up ryan leaky put a video with

1957.519 --> 1959.84
you chatting about the sun stuff oh

1959.279 --> 1962.799
really

1959.84 --> 1963.84
he did i didn't know that but yeah i've

1962.799 --> 1966.72
discussed

1963.84 --> 1969.039
the sun stuff and the apparent speed

1966.72 --> 1971.3600000000001
angular speed

1969.039 --> 1973.36
the non-physical object the edge of

1971.36 --> 1976.399
vision yeah discussed that many times

1973.36 --> 1978.559
over the last years

1976.399 --> 1978.559
so

1980.0 --> 1985.6
if he wanted to use one of my

1982.64 --> 1985.6000000000001
explanations

1985.76 --> 1989.2
on his videos that's fine

1989.36 --> 1992.9599999999998
would be great if he gave me maybe some

1991.44 --> 1995.3600000000001
credit for it

1992.96 --> 1996.24
verbally i don't know if he did or

1995.36 --> 2005.84
didn't

1996.24 --> 2005.84
but that's pretty cool

2017.44 --> 2021.6000000000001
right and sun speed that could be any

2019.76 --> 2022.08
that could be like in the last three

2021.6 --> 2024.08
years

2022.08 --> 2026.799
because i've talked about that for a

2024.08 --> 2026.799
long time

2027.279 --> 2034.32
so what the video i made was all about

2031.2 --> 2037.44
you made a video i didn't know you have

2034.32 --> 2037.4399999999998
videos on your channel

2038.32 --> 2047.84
let me check that out

2057.359 --> 2074.96
chasing the sun is that it

2061.2 --> 2079.2799999999997
that's six months ago alright

2074.96 --> 2079.28
all right it's a text video

2080.48 --> 2089.839
with some graphs

2093.76 --> 2097.0400000000004
right yeah i can't make out what this is

2095.76 --> 2098.8
about

2097.04 --> 2103.839
without sound i'm not gonna play the

2098.8 --> 2103.8390000000004
sound that's fine

2116.64 --> 2119.839
i'll link your video

2123.76 --> 2131.8390000000004
there we go

2142.16 --> 2145.839
it has no sound at all

2156.839 --> 2162.24
okay

2159.2 --> 2164.56
but could you describe

2162.24 --> 2166.9599999999996
what's basically being analyzed in that

2164.56 --> 2166.96
video

2167.44 --> 2173.839
maybe we could talk about it

2205.599 --> 2217.6800000000003
all right

2214.32 --> 2218.2400000000002
right so in the meantime flat earth

2217.68 --> 2220.64
debate

2218.24 --> 2222.16
yesterday was was a blast was pretty

2220.64 --> 2229.839
good

2222.16 --> 2229.839
i was very active

2231.68 --> 2234.0
uh

2237.04 --> 2240.64
did i go out when you have to

2241.68 --> 2244.56
i show i did

2246.0 --> 2251.359
not sure anymore but anyway there was

2248.88 --> 2255.04
also gary and terry later that evening

2251.359 --> 2271.839
and i also watched alex jones weird

2255.04 --> 2271.839
senses weird sensations

2293.599 --> 2299.6800000000003
all right today should be by the way the

2295.68 --> 2301.2799999999997
big protests

2299.68 --> 2313.839
over here in the netherlands i wonder

2301.28 --> 2313.8390000000004
how that's gonna go

2352.839 --> 2355.839
hmm

2374.56 --> 2380.0789999999997
what takes pairs of series on roughly

2377.68 --> 2386.24
same latitudes and times between

2380.079 --> 2386.2400000000002
solar moon cities to work out solar what

2394.16 --> 2411.839
so are you saying it's kind of like

2396.079 --> 2411.8390000000004
about triangulation again

2422.839 --> 2425.839
okay

2429.839 --> 2434.16
right so it is a triangulation thing

2437.28 --> 2446.4
cross-referencing it with both

2440.64 --> 2449.04
both disk and spherical presuppositional

2446.4 --> 2453.839
vantage points right sound monkey 3d is

2449.04 --> 2453.839
that what that's all about all about

2462.079 --> 2467.8390000000004
hello nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

2493.839 --> 2495.92

keep on going for like four hours

2606.64 --> 2613.2799999999997

2678.56 --> 2685.119
because i finally got that shipment in

2681.599 --> 2685.119
that could last me a year

2686.88 --> 2690.1600000000003
or it should at least last me half a

2689.359 --> 2693.2
year if i

2690.16 --> 2693.2
smoke a lot of it

2694.4 --> 2698.8
or the latest video on troll versus

2696.88 --> 2704.0
troll arguing with oh that part

2698.8 --> 2707.04
okay yeah sure sure that happened

2704.0 --> 2710.16
mean that time on brandon

2707.04 --> 2711.2
that's fine if he wants to highlight

2710.16 --> 2713.44
that and

2711.2 --> 2716.0
i don't know man want to call me the bad

2713.44 --> 2719.599
man or call bob the bad man or

2716.0 --> 2722.319
maybe we're just both the bad man

2719.599 --> 2725.04
i don't know that's all fine you know it

2722.319 --> 2725.04
can't stop him

2727.44 --> 2730.7200000000003
i remember that situation and i know

2729.44 --> 2733.119
that i

2730.72 --> 2735.04
yeah i didn't get excessive or anything

2733.119 --> 2736.88
so

2735.04 --> 2747.839
other people want to show that video

2736.88 --> 2747.839
that's perfectly fine

2756.2 --> 2761.839
[Music]

2758.839 --> 2761.839
uh

2762.59 --> 2765.9590000000003
[Music]

2800.839 --> 2803.839
hmm

2805.359 --> 2817.839
right so anyway it seems like stone

2808.4 --> 2817.839
monkey 3d is chasing the moon

2837.839 --> 2842.0
oh wait now he's chasing the sun by the

2839.76 --> 2859.8390000000004
way solar noon

2842.0 --> 2859.839
not lunar moon not lunar noon

2873.52 --> 2876.64
oh yeah by the way i almost forgot to

2874.96 --> 2878.4
mention like yesterday also was

2876.64 --> 2881.52
interesting

2878.4 --> 2884.559
like i heard jaren over

2881.52 --> 2886.96
at lift the veils i think

2884.559 --> 2888.8
yeah they both were talking crypto and

2886.96 --> 2891.92
that was kind of interesting to see them

2888.8 --> 2891.92
get together and do that

2895.92 --> 2901.44
i think jaren had some really solid

2898.559 --> 2903.44
advice on that

2901.44 --> 2904.88
fortunately i'm not really in a position

2903.44 --> 2908.64
to

2904.88 --> 2911.2000000000003
to utilize it anyway not just yet

2908.64 --> 2912.0
but it was all it did sound sensible

2911.2 --> 2914.0
it's just like

2912.0 --> 2916.48
okay how are you going to try to grow

2914.0 --> 2918.48
your money and not just

2916.48 --> 2920.72
throw it overboard yeah that really got

2918.48 --> 2923.52
to me it was right there

2920.72 --> 2924.8799999999997
and like he felt it or something or

2923.52 --> 2928.4
maybe it is just

2924.88 --> 2930.1600000000003
universally in the air and i happened to

2928.4 --> 2932.96
be caught in it

2930.16 --> 2933.92
but it made sense to me and that's also

2932.96 --> 2936.16
why i'm

2933.92 --> 2936.16
like

2940.24 --> 2947.04
basically gonna stop drinking and

2943.44 --> 2949.359
cannabis like i really got to quit it

2947.04 --> 2950.48
not because it's even bad for me it's

2949.359 --> 2953.7599999999998
just that i can't

2950.48 --> 2956.96
financially manage it anymore and i

2953.76 --> 2959.119
need to figure out a way to be more

2956.96 --> 2961.28
productive

2959.119 --> 2964.48
it's also my subconscious is kind of

2961.28 --> 2964.48
getting sick of all this

2965.68 --> 2970.319
like even even correlating with dark

2968.8 --> 2972.559
world visions

2970.319 --> 2976.4
like i knew it was gonna come at some

2972.559 --> 2976.4
point i knew it was gonna come

2976.88 --> 2981.92
and i've been kind of desperate to try

2979.2 --> 2985.839
to alter

2981.92 --> 2990.64
what was gonna happen eventually

2985.839 --> 2992.88
and it isn't so this is what i gotta do

2990.64 --> 2994.24
see if i can survive this if the

2992.88 --> 2996.079
chemistry

2994.24 --> 2998.5589999999997
that i'm going to have to maintain for

2996.079 --> 3003.2000000000003
myself if that's still makes

2998.559 --> 3006.6400000000003
all this doable right i'll have some

3003.2 --> 3009.359
less financial pressure perhaps

3006.64 --> 3012.24
still no yeah i don't see any real

3009.359 --> 3014.319
progression coming out of it though like

3012.24 --> 3017.9199999999996
building up money

3014.319 --> 3021.359
man but who knows maybe i will

3017.92 --> 3022.079
maybe i've underestimated the financial

3021.359 --> 3027.839
drain

3022.079 --> 3027.8390000000004
of it all

3031.04 --> 3036.8
but yeah i'm sick of being

3034.079 --> 3041.8390000000004
in that position where i just i can't

3036.8 --> 3041.8390000000004
really save up anything

3047.2 --> 3050.5589999999997
just looking for scraps

3052.319 --> 3058.82
i'm gonna try to change it around

3055.66 --> 3058.8199999999997
[Music]

3061.28 --> 3064.48
and we'll see where it brings me you

3063.44 --> 3066.88
know perhaps

3064.48 --> 3068.2400000000002
like doors are gonna open that i'm going

3066.88 --> 3071.52
to be so pissed

3068.24 --> 3075.68
off at so pissed off

3071.52 --> 3075.68
that it actually opens those doors

3076.48 --> 3084.319
and that they wouldn't open other ways

3080.4 --> 3086.7200000000003
i don't know what like my ego is really

3084.319 --> 3087.44
really not happy about any of this this

3086.72 --> 3089.68
is

3087.44 --> 3090.28
but on the other hand my ego can go [ __ ]

3089.68 --> 3093.439
itself

3090.28 --> 3093.4390000000003
[Music]

3095.68 --> 3100.24
i think i gave it enough room to make

3098.0 --> 3103.44
its presence

3100.24 --> 3106.5589999999997
available to show

3103.44 --> 3108.079
the temp try and temper it but yeah no

3106.559 --> 3112.2400000000002
my ego can really go

3108.079 --> 3112.2400000000002
[ __ ] itself and

3113.359 --> 3118.319
i just want out of this i just want out

3116.319 --> 3125.839
of this financial drain situation i

3118.319 --> 3125.839
don't want to be in this anymore

3130.16 --> 3135.1189999999997
since i've done it before i've mentioned

3133.28 --> 3136.7200000000003
this many times by the way in the last

3135.119 --> 3138.96
few years because it's not the first

3136.72 --> 3142.72
time where i'm in a financial

3138.96 --> 3146.4
slump right but it's just

3142.72 --> 3146.3999999999996
just i don't want to do this anymore

3148.64 --> 3152.319
so i've quit before with cannabis to

3151.359 --> 3156.4
save myself

3152.319 --> 3157.04
money that's like over a decade ago but

3156.4 --> 3159.839
i did it

3157.04 --> 3160.5589999999997
i just remember i had a very miserable

3159.839 --> 3163.68
time

3160.559 --> 3167.76
and was surrounded by people that

3163.68 --> 3170.64
did not respect me at all

3167.76 --> 3172.559
right and those were supposedly what i

3170.64 --> 3173.68
thought were close friends and that was

3172.559 --> 3177.2000000000003
part of

3173.68 --> 3180.24
just bad news the whole setup

3177.2 --> 3182.48
it's my own freaking fault like i'm

3180.24 --> 3185.4399999999996
very angry at myself for a lot of

3182.48 --> 3189.52
decisions i made back in the past

3185.44 --> 3191.76
very very furious about that

3189.52 --> 3192.72
it's part of the reason that i get

3191.76 --> 3196.48
shouty

3192.72 --> 3198.8799999999997
out of nowhere not like on air

3196.48 --> 3199.839
but why i get bad moods then i start to

3198.88 --> 3203.119
like get

3199.839 --> 3205.2
really freaking furious and that's

3203.119 --> 3207.92
because

3205.2 --> 3208.96
like i know i'm here i'm in this point

3207.92 --> 3212.0
i'm

3208.96 --> 3216.16
in this life the way it is because of my

3212.0 --> 3218.559
[ __ ] up stupid lazy-ass cowardly

3216.16 --> 3219.839
piece of [ __ ] gamma decisions that i

3218.559 --> 3223.119
made in the past

3219.839 --> 3224.5589999999997
that have cut off certain opportunities

3223.119 --> 3227.839
to myself

3224.559 --> 3230.079
that never going to restore like i will

3227.839 --> 3231.68
never have those opportunities again

3230.079 --> 3234.8
ever

3231.68 --> 3236.8799999999997
so if i want to try to get even close to

3234.8 --> 3239.52
that i'm gonna have to suffer for it

3236.88 --> 3239.52
and i will

3240.24 --> 3244.0789999999997
right because i wanna make it i wanna

3243.44 --> 3246.64
make it

3244.079 --> 3248.2400000000002
even if it literally kills me i wanna

3246.64 --> 3251.04
make it

3248.24 --> 3252.24
i'm not gonna give up i'm gonna continue

3251.04 --> 3255.7599999999998
trying to

3252.24 --> 3257.839
build my life out do something that's

3255.76 --> 3262.559
actually stabilized

3257.839 --> 3263.68
and i'm sick of this world man i'm sick

3262.559 --> 3266.4
of how it works

3263.68 --> 3268.319
i'm sick of satan i'm sick of money but

3266.4 --> 3269.71
if that's what it's gonna be

3268.319 --> 3272.079
well

3269.71 --> 3275.52
[Music]

3272.079 --> 3278.799
like what's what is freaking purity

3275.52 --> 3282.359
what does it even mean when you have to

3278.799 --> 3285.7599999999998
literally die slow

3282.359 --> 3286.48
excruciating fading kind of death where

3285.76 --> 3288.96
you just feel

3286.48 --> 3290.96
everything you do is pointless what the

3288.96 --> 3293.839
[ __ ] is the purpose in that

3290.96 --> 3293.839
i'm sick of it

3295.2 --> 3300.3999999999996
because it's not working i thought it

3296.72 --> 3300.3999999999996
was going to work it's not working

3304.839 --> 3307.839
so

3307.85 --> 3311.0699999999997
[Music]

3312.079 --> 3316.6400000000003
so i i am going to try to get a job and

3314.799 --> 3320.88
i'm going to get all sweaty and

3316.64 --> 3322.24
super anxious super super nightmarishly

3320.88 --> 3326.1600000000003
anxious where literally

3322.24 --> 3328.16
suede is gonna break out at a whim

3326.16 --> 3330.8799999999997
giving off a sensation that i'm a

3328.16 --> 3333.359
completely unstable person

3330.88 --> 3335.599
right when i can't use it because that

3333.359 --> 3337.68
always [ __ ] happens thanks to this

3335.599 --> 3338.88
[ __ ] little ego that i'm locked in

3337.68 --> 3341.5989999999997
with

3338.88 --> 3342.1600000000003
right there's nothing i can do about it

3341.599 --> 3345.599
except

3342.16 --> 3348.5589999999997
sit through the torture until it's

3345.599 --> 3351.28
ripped everything away from me that

3348.559 --> 3351.28
causes that

3351.359 --> 3354.5589999999997
i'm done with being like that i'm done

3353.839 --> 3363.839
with this

3354.559 --> 3363.8390000000004
format i'm done with it

3368.559 --> 3373.52
hello james mason used to smoke the best

3372.319 --> 3376.72
herb it was called

3373.52 --> 3379.92
other peoples

3376.72 --> 3379.9199999999996
can't smoke it anymore

3380.24 --> 3383.359
what do you mean it cause called other

3382.48 --> 3391.839
people's

3383.359 --> 3391.839
multiple tests what

3412.64 --> 3419.839
okay terminoid what

3424.0 --> 3433.839
right it's yeah

3427.44 --> 3433.839
it's just

3436.64 --> 3439.92
just going to be like this

3441.68 --> 3447.839
it's going to be different always going

3443.28 --> 3447.8390000000004
to radiate different things

3455.04 --> 3461.839
tim's missing

3462.0 --> 3466.799
what you mean that i'm smoking because

3464.72 --> 3468.48
other people are financing me

3466.799 --> 3470.4
and that's the reason i've been able to

3468.48 --> 3472.0
smoke cannabis is that what you're

3470.4 --> 3474.96
saying james mason

3472.0 --> 3475.76
oh yeah you got a point there you got a

3474.96 --> 3479.119
point

3475.76 --> 3481.92
guilty as charged yeah yeah i did

3479.119 --> 3483.2000000000003
i did use a lot of donations from you

3481.92 --> 3487.04
guys

3483.2 --> 3487.04
for freaking drugs i have

3487.44 --> 3491.28
and i'm even gonna say it like i used it

3490.16 --> 3493.7599999999998
for drugs and i'm

3491.28 --> 3494.48
[ __ ] ashamed for it right on the

3493.76 --> 3500.48
other hand

3494.48 --> 3500.48
it was kind of it has served its purpose

3501.68 --> 3504.319
it has

3505.2 --> 3511.68
but it's got to stop because this is not

3508.319 --> 3514.24
viable i don't know if

3511.68 --> 3514.96
this has anything to do with god or if

3514.24 --> 3518.0789999999997
it's just

3514.96 --> 3519.04
really stupid basics in my own personal

3518.079 --> 3521.2000000000003
dynamics

3519.04 --> 3522.16
but it just seems like i'm not allowed

3521.2 --> 3525.359
to do it

3522.16 --> 3530.16
because every time i do i get

3525.359 --> 3533.2
stuck like this

3530.16 --> 3534.64
maybe it's also kind of like a pacifying

3533.2 --> 3545.839
influence that it has

3534.64 --> 3545.839
i don't know what it is

3555.599 --> 3560.2400000000002
sugar is the worst drug yeah i don't use

3558.319 --> 3563.44
sugar

3560.24 --> 3569.2799999999997
only in my coffee that's the only

3563.44 --> 3569.28
spot i actually apply sugar drug is food

3570.48 --> 3577.04
dude whatever like i i'm glad

3574.079 --> 3578.2400000000002
you people understand and tolerate it

3577.04 --> 3580.079
i've lost my

3578.24 --> 3582.0
tolerance and understanding for this

3580.079 --> 3584.1600000000003
because i'm just done with the [ __ ]

3582.0 --> 3587.839
suffering i'm done with it i'm not gonna

3584.16 --> 3587.839
do this anymore

3588.319 --> 3592.5589999999997
i'm going to sit through it again like i

3590.48 --> 3593.04
did over 10 years ago and i'm going to

3592.559 --> 3596.96
just

3593.04 --> 3600.96
there's more than just almost

3596.96 --> 3604.0
is it 23

3600.96 --> 3609.44
2003 i thought it was

3604.0 --> 3609.44
until 2011. yeah that's right

3609.52 --> 3613.119
that's when i didn't smoke and it was

3611.599 --> 3616.4
not a nice period and

3613.119 --> 3619.76
especially this part i was not

3616.4 --> 3623.359
a nice person at all

3619.76 --> 3626.7200000000003
i was extremely cynical

3623.359 --> 3629.2799999999997
and basically

3626.72 --> 3631.7599999999998
just saying like no [ __ ] everything

3629.28 --> 3634.0
everything everything can literally drop

3631.76 --> 3635.119
dead right in front of my feet no matter

3634.0 --> 3640.16
how [ __ ] cute

3635.119 --> 3644.2400000000002
and i'm not gonna give a glimpse nothing

3640.16 --> 3644.24
that's how freaking cynical i got

3647.839 --> 3651.52
apathetic completely

3654.48 --> 3661.28
because i don't know my ego just said no

3658.72 --> 3663.52
the world is making me do this is

3661.28 --> 3666.559
forcing me to do this

3663.52 --> 3669.28
so i hate the world i guess that

3666.559 --> 3672.3190000000004
typically would be a sign of of drug

3669.28 --> 3672.3190000000004
addiction wouldn't it

3672.559 --> 3678.4
oh yeah but i am i am addicted i am

3676.559 --> 3680.48
addicted to cannabis

3678.4 --> 3681.44
it's a mental type of addiction because

3680.48 --> 3683.92
it yeah in

3681.44 --> 3685.52
physical ways it does actually have some

3683.92 --> 3689.28
kind of benefit

3685.52 --> 3691.44
even to the mind right

3689.28 --> 3694.4
but it has another influence too

3691.44 --> 3694.4
psychologically

3695.359 --> 3699.04
and that is where for me it becomes

3697.44 --> 3701.44
problematic

3699.04 --> 3703.7599999999998
it probably gets even more problematic

3701.44 --> 3712.16
for other people

3703.76 --> 3715.3590000000004
but for me it's still problematic enough

3712.16 --> 3718.3999999999996
and it is purely finance based

3715.359 --> 3720.48
purely like if i'd have

3718.4 --> 3721.92
a better situation and yeah i'm not

3720.48 --> 3723.76
gonna get there like this

3721.92 --> 3726.16
right that's the problem if i had a

3723.76 --> 3728.48
better situation i'd have a house

3726.16 --> 3729.839
whatever with a garden i could literally

3728.48 --> 3732.88
just make it myself

3729.839 --> 3736.16
and just save incredible

3732.88 --> 3741.839
amounts of money i've done that before

3736.16 --> 3741.839
way back

3746.64 --> 3750.799
anyway thank you clutch bear for praying

3748.96 --> 3755.839
for me i appreciate that i could

3750.799 --> 3755.839
probably use some

3760.799 --> 3765.0389999999998
stream and make good feet game con

3763.76 --> 3768.6400000000003
really

3765.039 --> 3772.96
like what just playing games online

3768.64 --> 3772.96
getting other people hooked on games

3780.839 --> 3785.2799999999997
really

3782.47 --> 3787.359
[Music]

3785.28 --> 3788.88
well maybe at some point i will maybe at

3787.359 --> 3793.7599999999998
some point i'll just choose

3788.88 --> 3798.799
to do just that because i do play games

3793.76 --> 3798.7990000000004
play a couple of games right

3799.359 --> 3803.359
and maybe i should just say okay no

3801.359 --> 3806.88
screw it i must

3803.359 --> 3810.16
try to make some money out of this so

3806.88 --> 3813.039
yeah let's stream it and [ __ ] it

3810.16 --> 3813.839
whatever man i'll just play it the way i

3813.039 --> 3816.2400000000002
play and

3813.839 --> 3817.68
i don't know maybe that would work i

3816.24 --> 3820.24
don't know if it would man

3817.68 --> 3825.839
the market's just overly saturated with

3820.24 --> 3825.839
freaking gamers

3831.92 --> 3835.599
yeah that's very cute i don't have a

3834.559 --> 3838.1600000000003
bath

3835.599 --> 3838.96
okay i don't have it i don't have a

3838.16 --> 3842.16
house

3838.96 --> 3844.48
i don't have a garden i don't have any

3842.16 --> 3848.0789999999997
of those things

3844.48 --> 3850.2400000000002
right i don't have a mobile camera

3848.079 --> 3851.44
i don't have any of that i have a

3850.24 --> 3854.9599999999996
freaking pc

3851.44 --> 3856.96
a webcam a microphone a little shitty

3854.96 --> 3859.359
room that i've been stuck in for seven

3856.96 --> 3859.359
years

3862.24 --> 3867.839
yeah that's it

3869.039 --> 3872.1600000000003
yeah well cameron kamikaze gilmore

3871.039 --> 3874.7200000000003
that's nice i

3872.16 --> 3875.2799999999997
agree there's nothing i can do about it

3874.72 --> 3878.3999999999996
though

3875.28 --> 3881.8390000000004
there's nothing i can do about it right

3878.4 --> 3881.839
it's over

3882.4 --> 3887.44
yeah so my system is then going to

3884.72 --> 3890.64
scream out for more nourishment

3887.44 --> 3893.44
who knows man i might actually start to

3890.64 --> 3894.64
[ __ ] overcompensate the loss of

3893.44 --> 3898.319
cannabis

3894.64 --> 3900.799
by eating more and then spending all

3898.319 --> 3902.5589999999997
that extra money that way so i'll still

3900.799 --> 3905.28
be poor because i don't know i'm

3902.559 --> 3908.0
supposed to be [ __ ] poor or something

3905.28 --> 3908.799
i'm supposed to never get out of this

3908.0 --> 3912.16
poverty

3908.799 --> 3915.7599999999998
ever in this [ __ ] life

3912.16 --> 3920.64
every time every

3915.76 --> 3920.6400000000003
[ __ ] time it happens every [ __ ]

3920.839 --> 3923.839
time

3930.0 --> 3940.64
online stream dnd

3936.96 --> 3940.64
cool i guess

3941.039 --> 3944.7200000000003
i could potentially do that

3944.799 --> 3949.599
but i couldn't do it because i had a

3947.599 --> 3952.6400000000003
screaming need for money

3949.599 --> 3953.839
right then it doesn't work if i want to

3952.64 --> 3958.319
do dnd

3953.839 --> 3961.599
i need tranquility i need peace of mind

3958.319 --> 3966.16
because being a gay master is a

3961.599 --> 3968.48
lot of energy and focus

3966.16 --> 3969.92
you have to basically wield an entire

3968.48 --> 3971.76
virtual world

3969.92 --> 3973.76
if you're [ __ ] stressed out because

3971.76 --> 3975.039
you're afraid you might not eat the next

3973.76 --> 3979.8390000000004
day

3975.039 --> 3979.8390000000004
that's not gonna work well together

3981.44 --> 3987.76
but it is an interesting idea

3984.72 --> 3990.24
i could do it i do miss playing dnd and

3987.76 --> 3990.88
the freaking dnd group just never got

3990.24 --> 3993.7599999999998
back

3990.88 --> 3994.7200000000003
that it's gone that d d group i did it

3993.76 --> 3996.7990000000004
for five years

3994.72 --> 3999.839
it's gone they're not just they're not

3996.799 --> 3999.839
responding anymore

4003.839 --> 4007.839
and i miss it

4009.119 --> 4013.6800000000003
especially miss that i'm not going to be

4011.359 --> 4017.52
able to finish the story

4013.68 --> 4020.16
that has been playing for five years

4017.52 --> 4022.799
and no you can't just take the whole

4020.16 --> 4024.799
[ __ ] thing and then inject a new

4022.799 --> 4025.839
group of players it doesn't work that

4024.799 --> 4028.88
way

4025.839 --> 4029.359
there's huge character arcs they're

4028.88 --> 4032.0
really

4029.359 --> 4032.0
ingrained

4032.839 --> 4049.839
anyway i'll be back in two minutes

4060.839 --> 4063.839
so

4138.159 --> 4141.759
hey hello julia pavin

4142.159 --> 4147.839
it's been a while

4156.0 --> 4175.839
christmas a toaster dumbass keep

4160.159 --> 4175.839
projecting bananai

4177.12 --> 4182.3189999999995
well kevin horizons i don't need

4179.52 --> 4182.319
anything to

4183.52 --> 4190.080000000001
get a life back right i don't need

4186.719 --> 4193.199
ways to spend time i need ways

4190.08 --> 4196.4
to get money not spend

4193.199 --> 4203.839999999999
time right not to find joy

4196.4 --> 4203.839999999999
in time i need money

4214.84 --> 4217.84
so

4222.32 --> 4226.639999999999
building the ideal idea

4228.84 --> 4231.84
what

4253.28 --> 4262.88
all right never heard of it

4259.52 --> 4262.88
i guess i'll look it up

4263.92 --> 4268.4800000000005
i don't have any current ideas on what

4266.08 --> 4274.64
to do right now

4268.48 --> 4277.04
whoa whoa james mason

4274.64 --> 4277.04
bro

4284.84 --> 4287.84
ah

4293.199 --> 4295.839999999999
wait what

4298.56 --> 4302.8
hold on there's all kinds of stuff

4301.76 --> 4307.84
rolling in

4302.8 --> 4310.96
julio pabin also wow thank you too

4307.84 --> 4314.0
man okay that suddenly

4310.96 --> 4318.32
changed the picture thank you

4314.0 --> 4319.84
so much yeah i got i got 30 euros from

4318.32 --> 4323.759999999999
julio patman freaking

4319.84 --> 4327.679
50 euros from james mason brother

4323.76 --> 4332.2390000000005
thank you so much that's

4327.679 --> 4332.2390000000005
that is really very generous of you

4337.199 --> 4342.0
okay this means that i'm can actually

4340.56 --> 4344.080000000001
make that call to my dad

4342.0 --> 4346.0
and now please not gonna scold me and

4344.08 --> 4348.159
tell me like oh maybe

4346.0 --> 4349.679
oh maybe it's not enough that you quit

4348.159 --> 4353.44
smoking and drinking

4349.679 --> 4355.52
maybe also just relinquish your storage

4353.44 --> 4357.839999999999
and throw all that stuff you've been

4355.52 --> 4359.52
trying to save up for a home someday

4357.84 --> 4362.64
just throw it away

4359.52 --> 4364.88
to the garbage destroy it forever

4362.64 --> 4366.64
never to be seen again so that it'll

4364.88 --> 4368.84
never have use and it's been

4366.64 --> 4371.04
all for nothing maybe he'll do that

4368.84 --> 4373.6
again

4371.04 --> 4373.6
sorry this

4374.4 --> 4378.32
because he does that [ __ ] sometimes

4382.239 --> 4385.36
don't know why maybe it's just that he

4384.64 --> 4388.88
he can't

4385.36 --> 4388.88
accept that i'm like this

4390.4 --> 4393.92
i think that financial trouble i think

4393.6 --> 4396.56
that

4393.92 --> 4398.159
my financial phobia i probably inherited

4396.56 --> 4401.679
it from him and he

4398.159 --> 4405.04
mastered it at a high price

4401.679 --> 4405.84
he he managed to like cut everything out

4405.04 --> 4408.159
that

4405.84 --> 4410.2390000000005
made it a problem and he's kind of

4408.159 --> 4411.5199999999995
expecting me to do the same thing even

4410.239 --> 4415.12
though i'm

4411.52 --> 4415.120000000001
in many ways a different person

4420.64 --> 4423.84
but at least now i can say okay there's

4422.56 --> 4425.84
money coming in

4423.84 --> 4428.159000000001
can i please borrow something so i can

4425.84 --> 4431.52
buy some food right now oh yeah and i

4428.159 --> 4431.5199999999995
quit smoking and drinking

4434.719 --> 4438.84
hopefully you'll do it otherwise it's

4436.56 --> 4441.76
going to be a hungry few

4438.84 --> 4444.400000000001
days your goldsmithing stuff

4441.76 --> 4446.88
well most of it is over at my dad's

4444.4 --> 4446.879999999999
anyway

4447.12 --> 4450.32
but yeah i got a really great couch i

4449.28 --> 4453.679
got a very

4450.32 --> 4457.12
old beautiful wooden table

4453.679 --> 4459.36
that's yeah that you can

4457.12 --> 4460.719
basically take apart so it doesn't take

4459.36 --> 4464.0
up too much space

4460.719 --> 4467.44
that's from my freaking grandmother

4464.0 --> 4470.239
or even older it's through my it's

4467.44 --> 4472.08
just enormous sentimental value and it's

4470.239 --> 4475.678999999999
a beautiful thing

4472.08 --> 4478.8
like i even varnished it

4475.679 --> 4482.56
revarnished it myself

4478.8 --> 4487.04
etc and just

4482.56 --> 4490.719
stored stuff like

4487.04 --> 4493.04
all the drawings i made my old legos

4490.719 --> 4494.159
there's really not much left i've

4493.04 --> 4496.159
already pretty much

4494.159 --> 4497.679
trashed two thirds of everything that it

4496.159 --> 4501.36
originally was

4497.679 --> 4501.36
and it should have been it's just that

4502.4 --> 4506.0
how i've foreseen it it's really

4504.88 --> 4507.84
ridiculous when i

4506.0 --> 4511.76
think about james mason why do you keep

4507.84 --> 4516.08
retracting those messages

4511.76 --> 4516.400000000001
it's weird but the way i've foreseen it

4516.08 --> 4520.239
is

4516.4 --> 4523.36
once i get a place to finally unload

4520.239 --> 4528.639999999999
the storage to in in a house

4523.36 --> 4528.639999999999
then i can finally one piece by piece

4529.44 --> 4533.12
basically figure out what do i have and

4531.679 --> 4537.1990000000005
then what can go

4533.12 --> 4539.36
when i actually have the room for that

4537.199 --> 4540.32
so it can because as long as it's all

4539.36 --> 4543.679
stored i i

4540.32 --> 4546.4
can't really figure it out

4543.679 --> 4546.719
it's too difficult things that are too

4546.4 --> 4552.799999999999
much

4546.719 --> 4566.8
in the way they're already gone

4552.8 --> 4569.28
but james mason what's going on right

4566.8 --> 4571.84
john m truth passed five days without

4569.28 --> 4575.12
food just drinking water

4571.84 --> 4577.6
well were you completely stressed out

4575.12 --> 4579.679
during that time

4577.6 --> 4582.400000000001
because trust me that's going to make it

4579.679 --> 4582.4
very hard

4584.64 --> 4589.4400000000005
if you were in a good place and you

4586.4 --> 4591.599999999999
decide to do fasting

4589.44 --> 4593.839999999999
then yeah that works that can work

4591.6 --> 4596.719
because you're in a good place

4593.84 --> 4598.08
if you're in a bad place doesn't work

4596.719 --> 4601.76
that well

4598.08 --> 4602.64
get a lot of side effects stress-based

4601.76 --> 4609.84
side effects

4602.64 --> 4609.84
it sucks

4610.159 --> 4612.4
right

4617.04 --> 4622.88
anyway thank you so much all of you john

4619.6 --> 4625.92
m truth james mason and judy of pavon

4622.88 --> 4625.92
thank you very much

4626.159 --> 4637.839999999999
you've basically saved my day

4637.92 --> 4641.04
can't you move from the city and rent

4639.92 --> 4643.92
cheaper so you

4641.04 --> 4643.92
have more room

4644.239 --> 4652.0
might it maybe i have considered it

4649.44 --> 4653.7
try not to argue with my dad yeah no i

4652.0 --> 4655.52

[Music]

4655.52 --> 4659.6
i'm just gonna ask him look can i borrow

4657.92 --> 4665.84
it for a few days and then i

4659.6 --> 4665.84
i will send it back immediately

4691.679 --> 4698.64
i'll save also money from the store yes

4694.88 --> 4699.1990000000005
look it's it's not a bad idea i'll have

4698.64 --> 4701.6
to

4699.199 --> 4703.28
i've also asked even my social worker

4701.6 --> 4707.84
like could you

4703.28 --> 4707.84
help me figure it out how to do that

4711.92 --> 4716.64
because it is very stressful too ah god

4714.88 --> 4718.4800000000005
everything is freaking stressful i'm so

4716.64 --> 4721.84
pathetic dude

4718.48 --> 4721.839999999999
i'm so [ __ ] pathetic

4725.04 --> 4730.239
right but before i can do anything get

4727.44 --> 4731.44
out of any situation i have to stabilize

4730.239 --> 4734.08
my finances i

4731.44 --> 4736.239
have to build a surplus that's not going

4734.08 --> 4740.239
to just drop away again

4736.239 --> 4742.08
i have to get to that point if i don't

4740.239 --> 4745.759999999999
it doesn't matter what i could

4742.08 --> 4749.84
theoretically do i'll never get to it

4745.76 --> 4749.84
that's kind of the problem

4750.64 --> 4754.320000000001
could even help you move if you're up

4752.719 --> 4757.92
wow okay

4754.32 --> 4760.799999999999
i i actually

4757.92 --> 4760.8
appreciate that

4760.96 --> 4768.96
who knows if if it'll get to that

4764.88 --> 4768.96
i'll i'll consider asking

4770.08 --> 4777.84
but i don't foresee that happening

4772.08 --> 4777.84
anytime soon

4816.84 --> 4819.84
um

4826.0 --> 4829.679
i'm really hungry right now

4830.4 --> 4834.0
but i've been going for almost one and a

4833.04 --> 4837.199
half hours

4834.0 --> 4837.199
and yeah

4837.84 --> 4841.679
stress was relieved and then i get

4841.12 --> 4845.12
hungry

4841.679 --> 4848.88
what else is new but i'll just keep on

4845.12 --> 4848.88
going for at least the next half hour

4851.76 --> 4857.1990000000005
all right starting 80 12 dude

4854.88 --> 4858.2390000000005
hope all is okay well all has been

4857.199 --> 4861.36
better but

4858.239 --> 4864.48
doing okay right now

4861.36 --> 4867.199
it's just our win complainy day about my

4864.48 --> 4867.44
pathetic life and how financially inept

4867.199 --> 4869.599999999999
i

4867.44 --> 4869.599999999999
am

4871.04 --> 4875.84
dramatic decisions

4928.84 --> 4931.84
hmm

4937.52 --> 4945.84
okay interesting cattle apple

4982.74 --> 4985.83
[Music]

4998.84 --> 5001.84
right

5012.84 --> 5015.84
um

5026.84 --> 5029.84
so

5040.159 --> 5046.5599999999995
right anyway uh my earlier offer

5044.0 --> 5047.92
i i just said it once it's still open if

5046.56 --> 5051.679
anybody wants to

5047.92 --> 5055.36
join crypto system that i'm a part of

5051.679 --> 5058.56
through gti that would help a lot

5055.36 --> 5058.5599999999995
in my situation

5059.52 --> 5064.8
it would give me access to potential

5061.84 --> 5068.08
financial withdrawals in there

5064.8 --> 5069.92
without having to literally wait months

5068.08 --> 5072.719
which is where it's at right now at

5069.92 --> 5072.719
least it seems

5073.92 --> 5080.32
but yeah you'd have to actually

5077.28 --> 5080.96
be interested in that and thus far i

5080.32 --> 5083.599999999999
have

5080.96 --> 5085.76
i have not i've mentioned gdi before

5083.6 --> 5087.280000000001
many times it's just

5085.76 --> 5091.04
you know maybe this is just the

5087.28 --> 5091.04
completely the wrong crowd for it

5093.12 --> 5097.44
i've not even spotted any consideration

5096.159 --> 5099.839999999999
in any of you

5097.44 --> 5099.839999999999
so far

5125.28 --> 5133.36
yeah okay ralph rodriguez

5129.52 --> 5137.040000000001
thanks i i appreciate that

5133.36 --> 5141.36
value my time more than money

5137.04 --> 5144.56
in a way it's

5141.36 --> 5144.5599999999995
then again i also

5145.199 --> 5151.28
do feel like i do waste time also

5148.96 --> 5152.88
not like doing the stream necessarily

5151.28 --> 5155.36
but just

5152.88 --> 5157.76
throughout the day i spend a lot of time

5155.36 --> 5162.08
kind of like

5157.76 --> 5164.639
chilling out and dream walking

5162.08 --> 5165.92
which hey it serves its function

5164.639 --> 5168.4800000000005
ethereal wise

5165.92 --> 5170.32
it does help me with like very intricate

5168.48 --> 5173.199
oversight

5170.32 --> 5174.96
that process and if i stop doing it then

5173.199 --> 5177.44
it's gonna drop away

5174.96 --> 5178.8
there's going to be no more oracle

5177.44 --> 5182.0
moments

5178.8 --> 5185.1990000000005
right okay i

5182.0 --> 5187.679
let's put that to the test right so

5185.199 --> 5191.28
is arwen still gonna have oracle moments

5187.679 --> 5192.88
even if he stops smoking cannabis

5191.28 --> 5197.84
do i still have it in me is there

5192.88 --> 5197.84
anything left

5200.48 --> 5203.36
we'll find out

5208.32 --> 5214.96
and maybe it's important to find out

5210.639 --> 5214.96
because maybe i've started to fear that

5218.639 --> 5225.28
like this weird idea that

5222.48 --> 5227.04
if i didn't have that anymore if i

5225.28 --> 5230.88
didn't have that to present

5227.04 --> 5232.48
to share to utilize that i would no

5230.88 --> 5234.32
longer be worth it

5232.48 --> 5236.32
that i literally would not be

5234.32 --> 5239.199
interesting enough anymore

5236.32 --> 5239.759999999999
but maybe that's towards myself maybe i

5239.199 --> 5243.759999999999
won't

5239.76 --> 5243.76
think i'm interesting enough anymore

5251.04 --> 5253.84
we'll see

5278.84 --> 5281.84
uh

5292.84 --> 5295.84
here

5306.84 --> 5311.6
oh

5309.12 --> 5311.599999999999
hmm

5312.639 --> 5317.04
so anyway i got like roughly 25 minutes

5316.0 --> 5320.48
more

5317.04 --> 5323.84
time to talk about whatever i prefer to

5320.48 --> 5323.839999999999
kind of get out of this

5326.0 --> 5338.56
out of this subject

5336.239 --> 5351.839999999999
or not or maybe we'll just hang in there

5338.56 --> 5351.84
for the next half hour

5363.44 --> 5365.839999999999
hmm

5367.84 --> 5373.52
all right so funny stuff

5370.96 --> 5375.199
like now i have this tobacco again like

5373.52 --> 5378.080000000001
i really

5375.199 --> 5380.638999999999
forgot like how much work it can be to

5378.08 --> 5380.639
cut it up

5380.88 --> 5387.52
but it yeah it's not bad and man i've

5384.08 --> 5389.36
already felt the difference since i

5387.52 --> 5392.320000000001
started smoking this

5389.36 --> 5396.48
versus just the regular tobacco it is

5392.32 --> 5396.48
such a world of difference it really is

5397.76 --> 5403.1990000000005
it's just much milder on the lungs a lot

5401.04 --> 5406.639
milder

5403.199 --> 5408.08
so it's kind of good

5406.639 --> 5410.2390000000005
especially if i'm not going to be

5408.08 --> 5411.12
smoking cannabis anymore and just this

5410.239 --> 5416.0
because

5411.12 --> 5418.84
just smoking the packaged tobacco

5416.0 --> 5421.12
is a real burden especially on my

5418.84 --> 5425.4400000000005
stomach and so having this

5421.12 --> 5434.32
will help me with that or against

5425.44 --> 5449.839999999999
that element

5434.32 --> 5449.84
and i have so much of it

5460.84 --> 5463.84
um

5474.84 --> 5477.84
do

5503.84 --> 5505.92
you

5519.199 --> 5523.839999999999
all right so hey if anybody wants to

5522.639 --> 5525.92
bring something up

5523.84 --> 5528.0
wants to discuss something or have a

5525.92 --> 5533.04
question

5528.0 --> 5536.32
feel free to ask

5533.04 --> 5536.32
otherwise i'm just going to be

5537.04 --> 5540.96
cutting up some of this tobacco

5544.96 --> 5549.36
i get i have to get the signals out

5550.08 --> 5558.239
what do you call that uh stems

5554.639 --> 5561.76
because those are not nice for smoking

5558.239 --> 5565.12
very bitter

5561.76 --> 5567.52
anyway is anybody still

5565.12 --> 5570.48
out here or did everybody flee to the

5567.52 --> 5570.4800000000005
flat earth debates

5573.36 --> 5580.32
ticket oh no it's

5576.4 --> 5580.32
it's starting in half an hour

5580.56 --> 5589.84
20 minutes

5591.36 --> 5594.398999999999
[Music]

5608.32 --> 5613.44
you were watching qe debate before i

5610.639 --> 5616.8
came on your life

5613.44 --> 5620.48
all right which debate was that was that

5616.8 --> 5620.4800000000005
like his recent numpty clip

5622.88 --> 5626.400000000001
like i could barely make out

5627.679 --> 5631.84
that recording

5642.84 --> 5645.84
hmm

5649.84 --> 5653.12
robert besano all right so it must have

5652.639 --> 5658.639
been

5653.12 --> 5658.96
from a while ago then all right by the

5658.639 --> 5660.56
way

5658.96 --> 5662.96
something that kind of stood out to me

5660.56 --> 5666.080000000001
yesterday was paula also did a live

5662.96 --> 5669.84
stream and she had like a whole

5666.08 --> 5671.5199999999995
church panel first i thought like it was

5669.84 --> 5674.400000000001
a pre-recorded thing but it was

5671.52 --> 5677.84
apparently completely live

5674.4 --> 5677.839999999999
so that was kind of an interesting

5684.84 --> 5698.079
development

5686.97 --> 5698.079000000001
[Music]

5698.84 --> 5701.84
hmm

5702.45 --> 5721.88
[Music]

5724.4 --> 5728.159
what is paula's channel called the bible

5727.04 --> 5743.76
literalist

5728.159 --> 5745.5199999999995
you know bible literalist

5743.76 --> 5748.0
all right i will link you up to that

5745.52 --> 5750.639
video it's like a two hour 50 minute

5748.0 --> 5754.639
stream from yesterday

5750.639 --> 5754.639
hey neil cosentino good to see you

5754.96 --> 5758.8
right so ralph rodriguez i just posted

5757.44 --> 5761.5199999999995
the link

5758.8 --> 5770.6900000000005
to the video in question of the channel

5761.52 --> 5773.76
in question

5770.69 --> 5773.759999999999
[Music]

5782.639 --> 5785.84
what's up neil how are you doing

5786.91 --> 5790.46
[Music]

5797.65 --> 5803.728999999999
[Music]

5810.84 --> 5816.719
ugh

5813.6 --> 5816.719
yeah paul that's great

5821.52 --> 5827.92
like i get a little testing

5824.639 --> 5831.04
like because i'm an esoteric

5827.92 --> 5834.4
i'm very much esoteric natured christian

5831.04 --> 5836.96
eclectic and

5834.4 --> 5838.799999999999
paula is like really on top of the

5836.96 --> 5842.159
esoterics but

5838.8 --> 5845.76
she still has a lot of like natural

5842.159 --> 5848.159
esoteric sensibility and that

5845.76 --> 5850.159000000001
is really what saves her in my opinion

5848.159 --> 5852.239
it's just the intuition part

5850.159 --> 5854.48
not getting stuck up on the details but

5852.239 --> 5856.879999999999
rather the backdrop meaning of it all

5854.48 --> 5858.32
so she's like an esoteric exoterist

5856.88 --> 5862.0
almost

5858.32 --> 5866.159
and it's very interesting

5862.0 --> 5869.44
but i do typically like to test like i

5866.159 --> 5872.0
hate tests christianity

5869.44 --> 5872.799999999999
like i like to test it i like to test

5872.0 --> 5874.96
people's

5872.8 --> 5877.679
spirit i like to test their resolve i

5874.96 --> 5877.679
like to test

5878.08 --> 5884.639
their insight and understanding and like

5881.76 --> 5885.360000000001
what are the dog masks that they're

5884.639 --> 5891.04
going to

5885.36 --> 5891.04
at some point be holding on to

5894.719 --> 5901.44
so i get a little bit testy with her

5898.56 --> 5903.76
but i think she understands that we used

5901.44 --> 5907.04
to have some conflicts

5903.76 --> 5910.96
like earlier in the earlier days

5907.04 --> 5915.28
but i think she gets that now from me

5910.96 --> 5915.28
she's paula is a very wise woman

5920.96 --> 5924.0
so yeah paula is ace i definitely

5923.44 --> 5938.48
appreciate

5924.0 --> 5942.56
her presence on the scene

5938.48 --> 5942.5599999999995
uh oh yeah also watched

5944.159 --> 5948.638999999999
today like before the show watched some

5946.8 --> 5951.6
flat water video

5948.639 --> 5953.84
that he posted this night was it again

5951.6 --> 5953.84
about

5957.92 --> 5966.0
moving a mountain with faith

5961.84 --> 5968.88
this is a scenario with kane was it

5966.0 --> 5969.52
the giant was involved i don't know i

5968.88 --> 5971.36
kind of

5969.52 --> 5973.76
like lost track and i kind of forgot

5971.36 --> 5976.32
about it because of the stream

5973.76 --> 5977.92
should have mentioned it at the start

5976.32 --> 5979.36
too distracted

5977.92 --> 5981.119
but it was still interesting as it

5979.36 --> 5984.639
usually is

5981.119 --> 5987.36
also over 24 7 discord they were talking

5984.639 --> 5992.08
about astrology a lot

5987.36 --> 5992.08
in detail it's influence and all that

5992.719 --> 5999.36
didn't really get involved

5995.84 --> 6002.0
but it's just interesting to listen to

5999.36 --> 6002.0
sometimes

6006.84 --> 6014.8
right

6009.119 --> 6014.799999999999
i'm gonna roll a cigarette with this

6020.84 --> 6023.84
stuff

6028.94 --> 6032.04
[Music]

6037.6 --> 6051.84
i wish youtube would stop stalling

6076.84 --> 6079.84
ah

6088.96 --> 6093.84
and the weather sucks

6096.0 --> 6107.84
all right so i typically like to add

6098.88 --> 6107.84
just a tiny fragment of clover powder

6129.28 --> 6135.84
and then i roll it see

6146.84 --> 6149.84
so

6168.4 --> 6174.08
one sub atomic particle of gluta power

6171.76 --> 6174.08
what

6174.84 --> 6180.4800000000005
no

6177.36 --> 6180.48
it's not that little

6182.96 --> 6186.4
but yeah if you do it on the clover

6184.8 --> 6189.84
powder it's gonna just be

6186.4 --> 6191.92
like it's gonna be quite disgusting

6189.84 --> 6193.679
actually so it's always just a minimal

6191.92 --> 6197.4400000000005
amount

6193.679 --> 6197.4400000000005
because if i do too much it gets

6202.84 --> 6219.84
disgusting

6204.0 --> 6219.84
god damn it be back in two minutes

6244.84 --> 6247.84
so

6286.84 --> 6289.84
so

6314.84 --> 6320.0
you

6317.28 --> 6320.0
right so

6322.48 --> 6325.678999999999
yeah i think i'm gonna round out the

6324.08 --> 6330.88
show

6325.679 --> 6334.32
i already did 50 minutes extra

6330.88 --> 6336.32
but yeah it's it's been okay

6334.32 --> 6338.88
it's been good you guys have been very

6336.32 --> 6338.88
helpful

6342.84 --> 6348.8
uh

6344.88 --> 6351.36
so i guess thanks everyone for coming

6348.8 --> 6352.8
i hope you liked this show i thought

6351.36 --> 6356.32
yeah

6352.8 --> 6361.360000000001
it's the complaining pants show

6356.32 --> 6364.96
arwenian drama ah not drama it's just

6361.36 --> 6367.44
it's what it is but yeah you guys have

6364.96 --> 6368.32
donated some and that's been really

6367.44 --> 6370.0
helpful

6368.32 --> 6373.04
no trolls today well they're probably

6370.0 --> 6375.92
all just looking gloating like oh

6373.04 --> 6376.4
finally arwen is weak again he's not

6375.92 --> 6379.76
doing

6376.4 --> 6381.36
his strong man flat earth attitude

6379.76 --> 6383.52
because that's the thing that just

6381.36 --> 6384.719
really breaks them apart so if they see

6383.52 --> 6389.040000000001
me

6384.719 --> 6391.84
like oh begging for money complaining

6389.04 --> 6392.88
oh i'm a drug addict right i'm saying it

6391.84 --> 6396.08
so they shut up

6392.88 --> 6396.56
because now they can finally move some

6396.08 --> 6399.199
kind of

6396.56 --> 6400.080000000001
imagery over that nightmare that i've

6399.199 --> 6402.719
been providing

6400.08 --> 6405.119
them about how the earth is absolutely

6402.719 --> 6405.119
flat

6405.44 --> 6413.44
because i provided basically

6409.199 --> 6414.5599999999995
a a position of weakness that i have

6413.44 --> 6417.44
that

6414.56 --> 6419.679
it kind of takes away from the memory of

6417.44 --> 6423.119
those times where i was very

6419.679 --> 6425.28
strong with strong energy giving them

6423.119 --> 6428.08
the nightmares about how their world

6425.28 --> 6429.04
is just not what they think it is so

6428.08 --> 6431.119
it's good

6429.04 --> 6432.8
good for them to have a moment of

6431.119 --> 6436.32
breather like oh

6432.8 --> 6440.2390000000005
thank god irwin's only human so

6436.32 --> 6441.199
he won't potentially be able forever to

6440.239 --> 6444.239
just be that

6441.199 --> 6444.239
thorn in our eyes

6444.719 --> 6449.679
he's gonna have to get alive somehow now

6447.28 --> 6452.32
so maybe that'll give you some breathing

6449.679 --> 6455.4400000000005
room some reprieve

6452.32 --> 6456.239
for not being reminded constantly that

6455.44 --> 6460.4
the earth is

6456.239 --> 6460.4
absolutely flat

6466.32 --> 6471.84
find a job you love okay

6472.239 --> 6476.4
how long have you been out of a job

6474.4 --> 6485.839999999999
officially

6476.4 --> 6485.839999999999
uh about 41 years

6486.48 --> 6490.32
i i've never had a working career

6491.28 --> 6499.04
like i did a month call center

6495.04 --> 6503.119
work which is terrible few years ago

6499.04 --> 6506.159
shared that with everybody before that

6503.119 --> 6507.92
did very sporadic work like at the post

6506.159 --> 6511.119
office

6507.92 --> 6514.2390000000005
work for a bakery one time

6511.119 --> 6514.239
none of it lasted

6515.28 --> 6522.639
i well because i have a paper route

6519.52 --> 6523.119000000001
that i do and yeah it doesn't bring me

6522.639 --> 6525.6
anything

6523.119 --> 6540.5599999999995
but i do kind of like it don't make any

6525.6 --> 6542.8
real money out of it

6540.56 --> 6542.8
right

6544.8 --> 6548.159000000001
but yeah in a way this was the job i

6547.679 --> 6550.639
loved

6548.159 --> 6550.638999999999
it's just

6551.28 --> 6556.96
i can't survive of this not in the way

6554.639 --> 6560.2390000000005
that it was set up

6556.96 --> 6560.2390000000005
but who know where it'll go

6563.84 --> 6567.28
it gets you out of the house every day

6566.0 --> 6570.639
well it's not every day

6567.28 --> 6573.759999999999
i don't freaking do that every day that

6570.639 --> 6577.92
no it's one time in a week

6573.76 --> 6580.88
one day in a week that's it

6577.92 --> 6582.32
and i get out of the house every day

6580.88 --> 6586.159000000001
every single day

6582.32 --> 6586.159
every single day i get out of the house

6592.96 --> 6596.719
any manual practical skills that you can

6595.44 --> 6610.96
use

6596.719 --> 6613.76
yeah plenty

6610.96 --> 6614.8
like once i'm basically set or

6613.76 --> 6617.92
designated

6614.8 --> 6621.119000000001
for a function i expand

6617.92 --> 6624.32
like i always do more than

6621.119 --> 6624.96
what's expected on me always because i

6624.32 --> 6627.44
can't

6624.96 --> 6629.92
[ __ ] help it i have to do it it's

6627.44 --> 6634.96
like otherwise i'm literally gonna

6629.92 --> 6634.96
lose my freaking soul out of boredom

6637.76 --> 6641.88
how long have i had my channel i've

6640.4 --> 6644.719
since

6641.88 --> 6653.84
2016

6644.719 --> 6653.84
this is five years

6654.32 --> 6659.92
i have a trade batman forever i'm a

6657.36 --> 6659.92
goldsmith

6660.0 --> 6668.08
i have a trade also a trade is language

6663.36 --> 6671.36
skills trade is social communication

6668.08 --> 6674.0
right because as an individual

6671.36 --> 6675.44
alone in the world yeah it's very weird

6674.0 --> 6677.119
for me i often don't know how to

6675.44 --> 6678.0
approach people or what even to do with

6677.119 --> 6682.239
that

6678.0 --> 6685.36
if i have a function then everything

6682.239 --> 6688.32
changes everything changes

6685.36 --> 6689.36
suddenly i have a function as a vantage

6688.32 --> 6691.5199999999995
point

6689.36 --> 6693.5199999999995
it makes everything different when i

6691.52 --> 6694.400000000001
have a function when i have an appointed

6693.52 --> 6697.4400000000005
function

6694.4 --> 6700.96
i am different i can do different things

6697.44 --> 6703.36
i can do more if i don't have it if i

6700.96 --> 6707.36
don't gain it

6703.36 --> 6709.679
then i'm kind of like locked off

6707.36 --> 6711.92
that's how it works it's how it always

6709.679 --> 6712.32
work appoint me to do something and i'll

6711.92 --> 6715.36
do

6712.32 --> 6718.239
10 times as much as normal

6715.36 --> 6720.719
and that's a fact it's a [ __ ] fact

6718.239 --> 6723.839999999999
every single [ __ ] time i will

6720.719 --> 6725.92
always do 10 times more if i have an

6723.84 --> 6729.119000000001
appointed function

6725.92 --> 6737.52
right like you would have with the job

6729.119 --> 6740.48
it always happens

6737.52 --> 6742.8
right but i don't need your assistance

6740.48 --> 6745.119
in trying to find a career right now

6742.8 --> 6745.119000000001
thanks

6747.36 --> 6751.839999999999
i'll i'll talk it over with the

6752.08 --> 6756.0
the person that does that when i get to

6755.679 --> 6759.4400000000005
that

6756.0 --> 6762.84
if i if i'm gonna go there

6759.44 --> 6765.839999999999
and i might i might do it just this

6770.4 --> 6774.879999999999
skills i can summarize them

6772.48 --> 6775.5199999999995
that's kind of the advantage of being so

6774.88 --> 6777.1990000000005
freaking

6775.52 --> 6778.639
focused on yourself and your own

6777.199 --> 6781.598999999999
psychology a lot

6778.639 --> 6782.56
like i know everything i got i know what

6781.599 --> 6786.639

6782.56 --> 6790.159000000001

6786.639 --> 6794.0
i know everything i can do

6790.159 --> 6797.92
