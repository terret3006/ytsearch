94.159 --> 98.799
anyhow

96.159 --> 101.52000000000001
yeah sorry for starting late but the

98.799 --> 104.159
temperature was just so incredibly hot

101.52 --> 106.79899999999999
in here it was

104.159 --> 106.799
untenable

107.92 --> 112.399
weather is

109.6 --> 115.52
hot it is pretty blue sky but there's

112.399 --> 117.28
also trails and

115.52 --> 119.52
i don't know i wouldn't in this

117.28 --> 121.6
particular case i wouldn't even mind if

119.52 --> 125.079
it got a little cloudy because it's so

121.6 --> 125.079
freaking hot

132.48 --> 137.28
all right

134.72 --> 139.12
it is beautiful weather though i like

137.28 --> 143.48
i'm very late today

139.12 --> 143.48000000000002
oh there here it goes

156.959 --> 159.28
yep

162.8 --> 171.8
yeah i'm late because uh

165.68 --> 171.8
yeah i uh i went to bed very early today

172.08 --> 177.36
yesterday night like at one o'clock

175.44 --> 181.519
because i knew like it's gonna get hot

177.36 --> 181.519
so i better get to bed very quickly

181.599 --> 185.51899999999998
because in the morning it's gonna be

183.36 --> 188.0
unbearable and it was

185.519 --> 191.36
and so i got up very early and

188.0 --> 192.4
went out for groceries early and then

191.36 --> 195.36
took a

192.4 --> 197.20000000000002
nice walk in the forest and eat an apple

195.36 --> 198.64000000000001
i bought two apples

197.2 --> 200.39
eight one

198.64 --> 203.51
this is really that type of weather

200.39 --> 203.51
[Music]

204.0 --> 207.84
and then

205.68 --> 209.59900000000002
i met some guy

207.84 --> 212.799
on that road

209.599 --> 215.28
i was just walking around with the book

212.799 --> 217.59900000000002
and then later as i was going back

215.28 --> 220.64000000000001
it was like around

217.599 --> 220.64
10 minutes to one

220.799 --> 225.519
like he bumped into me again and then

223.76 --> 229.599
he kind of started the conversation

225.519 --> 231.20000000000002
guess what that book was a bible yes

229.599 --> 232.48
yes

231.2 --> 234.39999999999998
so

232.48 --> 236.0
we had like a conversation he turned out

234.4 --> 238.239
to be like

236.0 --> 241.04
in a part of a church and even like

238.239 --> 245.20000000000002
living there

241.04 --> 246.159
that is like right down the street

245.2 --> 248.39999999999998
it's like

246.159 --> 250.48
three times the distance as

248.4 --> 251.59900000000002
the church of the latter day saints

250.48 --> 253.51899999999998
right there

251.599 --> 255.11999999999998
and i had been there before but i never

253.519 --> 256.88
really knew like what is this church

255.12 --> 260.23900000000003
it's not even that old they said it's

256.88 --> 262.479
like 17 years old and it's like a

260.239 --> 264.79999999999995
singular church so it's not an

262.479 --> 267.44
organization it's just that one church

264.8 --> 267.44
it's fully

267.84 --> 272.0
independent

269.36 --> 275.12
spiritually that's interesting

272.0 --> 277.28
so yeah you showed me the building and

275.12 --> 280.08
bumped into some really attractive

277.28 --> 280.08
emails there

280.96 --> 285.35999999999996
and some pretty cool guys and dude these

283.759 --> 289.6
guys are crushing it they're getting a

285.36 --> 291.6
lot of funding apparently from members

289.6 --> 294.32000000000005
and

291.6 --> 296.639
looks interesting

294.32 --> 298.479
one thing that i missed was a giant

296.639 --> 301.68
garden even though they have the room

298.479 --> 303.75899999999996
for it so that might be something

301.68 --> 306.24
it's so funny because i've been like

303.759 --> 307.759
yeah i want a garden but

306.24 --> 309.199
well

307.759 --> 312.56
maybe

309.199 --> 315.44
i could start a garden there

312.56 --> 317.28000000000003
i mean they have giant amounts of room

315.44 --> 319.12
nobody seems to be doing anything with

317.28 --> 321.35999999999996
it

319.12 --> 321.36
so

322.32 --> 327.039
anyhow yeah i'll get the chat

324.88 --> 331.039
hello neil degrasse tyson lies first in

327.039 --> 332.4
chat psych bear bg's cnet

331.039 --> 333.59999999999997
matthew hall

332.4 --> 336.79999999999995
clutch

333.6 --> 340.28000000000003
let's see you all it is friday the 17th

336.8 --> 340.28000000000003
of june 2022

340.479 --> 345.24
and

341.919 --> 345.24
the temperature

345.44 --> 349.919
is 28 degrees okay it's not even 30.

350.56 --> 356.24
supposed to get 30 i guess

353.199 --> 356.24
later in the evening

357.199 --> 362.24
but yeah it's freaking hot

360.24 --> 364.72
very little humidity

362.24 --> 366.639
humidity which is good because then

364.72 --> 369.36
would really suck

366.639 --> 371.44
but uh yeah as long as the sun isn't

369.36 --> 374.16
hitting the wall

371.44 --> 374.16
it's doable

378.96 --> 382.79999999999995
garden is an awesome idea right and it

380.72 --> 385.36
could just keep it basic it's just like

382.8 --> 388.639
yeah tomatoes

385.36 --> 391.12
or something right

388.639 --> 393.039
maybe a bit late for that but it's

391.12 --> 394.8
it just stood out to me like hey there's

393.039 --> 397.919
no garden here and all that room why

394.8 --> 397.91900000000004
isn't there a garden here

401.039 --> 405.759
37

402.72 --> 407.52000000000004
oh my god clutch

405.759 --> 410.72
that is really hot

407.52 --> 412.479
anyway i got a gusto energy drink

410.72 --> 415.52000000000004
what is it two days ago now and now i'm

412.479 --> 415.52
gonna actually drink it

420.4 --> 425.919
so yeah i talked a lot with that guy

423.039 --> 428.0
who was like eritrean

425.919 --> 430.08
it's like a

428.0 --> 432.8
a black dude

430.08 --> 435.35999999999996
but a really of the a really cool tribe

432.8 --> 437.84000000000003
i like the eritreans

435.36 --> 441.12
a very fascinating tribe

437.84 --> 443.35999999999996
slim people very smart

441.12 --> 446.4
and they have like natural wisdom to

443.36 --> 446.40000000000003
them on average

446.639 --> 452.16
the ones that i've met so far anyway

449.599 --> 454.4
and uh yeah talking about the bible i

452.16 --> 456.8
try to act yeah i will

454.4 --> 459.28
try to basically relay like what is it

456.8 --> 461.52000000000004
that i am doing

459.28 --> 463.19899999999996
i didn't mention i tried to mention flat

461.52 --> 466.08
earth but he kind of rolled over it i

463.199 --> 468.0
don't think he heard it

466.08 --> 470.71999999999997
but i was basically trying to explain to

468.0 --> 473.599
him like hey how much

470.72 --> 473.59900000000005
of what you learn

473.919 --> 477.68
out there in the world everywhere how

476.72 --> 480.40000000000003
much of

477.68 --> 482.24
it do you think is real

480.4 --> 484.23999999999995
and he had a lot of trouble basically

482.24 --> 486.40000000000003
comprehending what i was even meaning it

484.24 --> 488.24
was just i guess he was just trying to

486.4 --> 490.63899999999995
convert me

488.24 --> 494.08
to christianity a lot even though that's

490.639 --> 495.36
like yeah that's not gonna work

494.08 --> 497.28
i ready

495.36 --> 499.28000000000003
i already am

497.28 --> 502.31899999999996
engaging

499.28 --> 502.31899999999996
here's how i do it

505.12 --> 509.52
but yeah i didn't really get to all that

507.759 --> 512.0
i might at some point i think i'd

509.52 --> 513.279
probably go back just at least once just

512.0 --> 516.479
to say hello

513.279 --> 518.399
it did feel kind of good because

516.479 --> 520.08
meeting people shaking some hands and

518.399 --> 522.8
all that

520.08 --> 524.88
and they were good people at least

522.8 --> 526.4799999999999
there's no secret darkness

524.88 --> 528.24
[Music]

526.48 --> 530.48
there

528.24 --> 531.36
very good feelings

530.48 --> 533.6800000000001
and

531.36 --> 534.48
yeah that did me some good because yeah

533.68 --> 536.399
i

534.48 --> 538.24
tend to be a little isolated as you all

536.399 --> 539.6
know

538.24 --> 541.44
and yeah

539.6 --> 543.6
this morning i just was feeling kind of

541.44 --> 543.6
like

543.76 --> 546.3199999999999
sickish

546.56 --> 551.3599999999999
also because of the heat

549.6 --> 552.16
and

551.36 --> 555.12
yeah

552.16 --> 555.12
i feel a lot better

555.6 --> 559.279
hello

556.56 --> 559.279
youtube

560.88 --> 564.24
already orinoco wombo

567.12 --> 570.9590000000001
metal slugs cockatiel

569.12 --> 574.72
seeking star water

570.959 --> 574.7199999999999
finding a community is important

577.279 --> 581.76
well and i i still just got to figure

579.36 --> 584.92
out like what is this though

581.76 --> 588.88
because maybe it is like sort of an open

584.92 --> 591.76
monastery type situation

588.88 --> 594.16
literally like it seems like they just

591.76 --> 595.76
are like okay you can just

594.16 --> 598.0
be here

595.76 --> 601.2
there's stuff to be done though if

598.0 --> 602.64
you're inspired to do it

601.2 --> 605.6800000000001
do it

602.64 --> 608.0
it's interesting

605.68 --> 608.0
right

609.36 --> 613.76
and uh yeah

611.68 --> 618.12
really cute ladies there that i bumped

613.76 --> 618.12
into that just happened to be there

631.2 --> 638.519
just like women that just wear dresses

634.079 --> 638.519
like it's normal because it is

639.24 --> 643.09
[Music]

648.079 --> 653.279
right so yeah

650.32 --> 655.36
i'm taking it easy i'm basically gonna

653.279 --> 657.2
approach this very similar to how i

655.36 --> 659.6
approached the church of the latter day

657.2 --> 660.72
saints although not like help me i'm

659.6 --> 663.6800000000001
possessed

660.72 --> 667.2
can you do a lay on hands

663.68 --> 668.959
not like that i'm not in that position

667.2 --> 670.5600000000001
now

668.959 --> 672.959
but

670.56 --> 676.0
i don't know it might just be a good pit

672.959 --> 677.5189999999999
place where i could just go

676.0 --> 680.64
to kind of like

677.519 --> 680.64
get rid of my

681.279 --> 686.079
negative feelings because i do have

683.44 --> 688.8000000000001
those at times

686.079 --> 690.16
because of what i do

688.8 --> 691.3599999999999
dream walking

690.16 --> 695.76
worrying

691.36 --> 698.24
right well worrying does kind of like

695.76 --> 700.64
you do collect darkness

698.24 --> 702.72
it does weigh on you and the only way to

700.64 --> 705.36
get rid of that is by basically dealing

702.72 --> 707.12
with people that don't do that

705.36 --> 710.32
it seems like the people there

707.12 --> 710.32
definitely don't do that

712.639 --> 717.279
so yeah we'll see what happens

715.12 --> 718.399
it's cool that it's like right around

717.279 --> 721.68
the corner

718.399 --> 724.68
it's not even like a kilometer away

721.68 --> 724.68
so

740.24 --> 742.639
little

742.839 --> 746.1600000000001
slugs game

749.44 --> 753.2
i wonder if i've ever played that don't

751.68 --> 755.4399999999999
remember the name

753.2 --> 757.76
but with all arcade games i just don't

755.44 --> 760.5600000000001
remember the names i really don't

757.76 --> 763.12
there's like one game i ever remember

760.56 --> 765.4399999999999
from the arcade and that is hot chase

763.12 --> 769.279
and i have the emulator on my computer

765.44 --> 773.6
because that thing was just like epic

769.279 --> 776.88
such a simple computer such

773.6 --> 776.88
impressive results

777.2 --> 780.2
anyway

789.04 --> 794.48
i played that game hot chase like so

791.839 --> 797.36
much when i went to spain

794.48 --> 799.6800000000001
because they had that arcade hall

797.36 --> 801.92
like pretty close to our camping

799.68 --> 803.5999999999999
and then they always had that game like

801.92 --> 805.279
a lot of things changed around but they

803.6 --> 806.24
always had that one it was a really good

805.279 --> 809.68
game

806.24 --> 809.6800000000001
no it's one of the older ones

809.839 --> 817.44
played that so much in between like

814.56 --> 818.56
like between i was like eight

817.44 --> 819.7600000000001
to

818.56 --> 822.079
fifteen

819.76 --> 825.92
or something i played it so much every

822.079 --> 825.92
time i was there in the summer

826.0 --> 829.24
good memories

829.519 --> 831.76
ah

840.079 --> 844.76
hello dj one deck house music

856.56 --> 861.04
name emily yeah that's right that's the

858.8 --> 861.04
one

868.24 --> 874.5600000000001
it would be really awesome the

871.519 --> 876.16
arcade cabinet right that that's what i

874.56 --> 878.7199999999999
was thinking

876.16 --> 880.88
to get like a you you just gotta get

878.72 --> 882.32
like the arcade set up and then dude

880.88 --> 885.279
just have like

882.32 --> 888.0790000000001
a lot of buttons and pokes

885.279 --> 889.199
and whatever is necessary and then just

888.079 --> 891.4399999999999
like

889.199 --> 894.079
just use that one arcade game and just

891.44 --> 897.12
switch the games in that right because

894.079 --> 899.279
you can just download them

897.12 --> 901.519
that would be pretty awesome to have

899.279 --> 901.519
that

901.6 --> 906.32
dude they might even just be like

904.959 --> 908.6389999999999
souls

906.32 --> 910.639
out there might be companies that makes

908.639 --> 913.92
them especially with that

910.639 --> 914.6800000000001
like even with all the arcade games ever

913.92 --> 917.809
who knows

914.68 --> 917.809
[Music]

918.0 --> 922.199

927.199 --> 931.12
i don't even remember that

929.279 --> 935.88
what i remember the name i don't even

931.12 --> 935.88
know what kind of a game console that is

951.19 --> 954.5600000000001
[Music]

952.399 --> 957.279
metal slugs okay it's definitely

954.56 --> 957.279
recognized

it's metal slug not slugs by the way

972.8 --> 977.68
run and gun

975.279 --> 981.56
ride one of those

977.68 --> 981.56
the running gun ones

984.0 --> 988.399
dude why aren't they showing pictures

985.92 --> 988.399
damn it

994.48 --> 1001.6
right at the side scroller platform type

999.04 --> 1004.079
very typical wow

1001.6 --> 1007.399
those graphics look pretty badass for an

1004.079 --> 1007.399
arcade game

1011.279 --> 1016.16
that looks

1012.959 --> 1018.4799999999999
really awesome

1016.16 --> 1018.48
dude

1019.519 --> 1025.76
man the old arcade games man

1023.68 --> 1028.48
they did everything right now look

1025.76 --> 1030.799
what's out there right now

1028.48 --> 1034.48
how did they do those old arcade game

1030.799 --> 1036.6399999999999
[ __ ] how did they all do it right

1034.48 --> 1041.199
and now

1036.64 --> 1041.199
it just doesn't work anymore

1045.76 --> 1049.52
like all that graphics man

1049.679 --> 1056.0
like

1051.28 --> 1058.72
there's a lot of graphics work in this

1056.0 --> 1058.72
incredible

1060.0 --> 1063.76
yeah i'll show some of that

1064.48 --> 1067.84
sorry about that

1082.0 --> 1085.2
come on come on

1093.28 --> 1095.6
right

1096.32 --> 1099.4399999999998
yeah neo geo

1102.0 --> 1105.88
just look at that

1116.799 --> 1123.799
things like this man that's just

1120.799 --> 1123.799
awesome

1127.28 --> 1131.6
apparently there's a steam game of it

1129.36 --> 1136.1599999999999
too so it did like move on but like even

1131.6 --> 1140.0
like that old version just looks

1136.16 --> 1140.0
it just looks really interesting

1146.48 --> 1150.6
metal slug x

1181.76 --> 1186.72
that's right something so nice about the

1183.76 --> 1188.4
simpler arcade games right and just

1186.72 --> 1191.52
the whole thing is

1188.4 --> 1193.52
simple doesn't mean easy

1191.52 --> 1196.48
you see

1193.52 --> 1198.799
if you keep it simple then you can make

1196.48 --> 1200.24
it much harder

1198.799 --> 1202.8799999999999
without just

1200.24 --> 1204.559
demoralizing you

1202.88 --> 1206.159
because it's simple you don't have to

1204.559 --> 1209.44
worry

1206.159 --> 1211.44
too much about complications

1209.44 --> 1214.0800000000002
you just have to like focus on the

1211.44 --> 1216.88
skills that you need for the challenges

1214.08 --> 1219.9389999999999
at hand

1216.88 --> 1219.939
[Music]

1220.4 --> 1224.159
right

1221.28 --> 1227.3999999999999
games now just want you to waste most of

1224.159 --> 1227.4
your life

1252.96 --> 1256.559
yes

1254.08 --> 1259.28
it's starting to shine through did you

1256.559 --> 1261.9189999999999
see that yeah it was that really

1259.28 --> 1265.6789999999999
expensive console it's the special boy

1261.919 --> 1265.679
console only rich people had

1267.6 --> 1272.76
and it did have wrecked really appealing

1269.76 --> 1272.76
games

1294.72 --> 1301.1200000000001
youtube dude

1296.64 --> 1302.5590000000002
i used to have a commodore 64

1301.12 --> 1305.52
which used

1302.559 --> 1309.8799999999999
floppy disks

1305.52 --> 1313.2
flexible floppy disks what is it like

1309.88 --> 1315.44
600 kilobytes or something

1313.2 --> 1315.44
like

1315.6 --> 1321.12
maybe even less i don't even know like

1318.0 --> 1324.0
less than a megabyte like super little

1321.12 --> 1326.0
amount on a floppy disk yeah some of

1324.0 --> 1327.679
those floppy disks

1326.0 --> 1328.799
had like

1327.679 --> 1331.2
eight

1328.799 --> 1333.44
entire video games

1331.2 --> 1335.76
on one floppy disk

1333.44 --> 1335.76
okay

1337.6 --> 1340.0
oh

1338.48 --> 1342.08
sorry

1340.0 --> 1347.679
on each side

1342.08 --> 1349.52
yeah you could fit 16 commodore 64 games

1347.679 --> 1351.2800000000002
the more basic ones though not the

1349.52 --> 1353.44
really elaborate ones

1351.28 --> 1356.08
but like basic commodore 64 games you

1353.44 --> 1357.679
could like fit 16 of them on a floppy

1356.08 --> 1360.6789999999999
disk now that's

1357.679 --> 1360.679
impressive

1366.64 --> 1372.159
yeah with the disk drive the separate

1368.72 --> 1374.159
giant closet for the floppy disks

1372.159 --> 1379.3200000000002
like the disk drive was bigger than the

1374.159 --> 1379.3200000000002
actual commodore 64. it was hilarious

1394.42 --> 1400.93
[Music]

1404.799 --> 1409.36
right

1406.799 --> 1411.9189999999999
it's an interesting thing by the way

1409.36 --> 1414.24
metal slows cockatiel in retrospect

1411.919 --> 1415.8400000000001
about the neo geo

1414.24 --> 1417.44
like it bombed because it was too

1415.84 --> 1419.12
expensive you say

1417.44 --> 1420.559
well

1419.12 --> 1421.52
i think i

1420.559 --> 1424.24
like

1421.52 --> 1425.76
it's because of the freaking art it's

1424.24 --> 1428.4
because

1425.76 --> 1430.72
they put so much man hours into these

1428.4 --> 1434.0
games

1430.72 --> 1436.96
to really not rush them and cash him in

1434.0 --> 1438.799
but to like really refine the games i

1436.96 --> 1440.72
think and that's why they would have

1438.799 --> 1443.9189999999999
been so expensive

1440.72 --> 1446.64
so it was like an attempt to basically

1443.919 --> 1449.039
create higher grade games

1446.64 --> 1451.44
but it yeah all those man hours it's

1449.039 --> 1453.52
just it become more expensive because of

1451.44 --> 1453.52
it

1453.76 --> 1460.24
and i guess that in that time frame

1457.039 --> 1462.32
it it just didn't hit off

1460.24 --> 1464.96
which is really too bad because it's a

1462.32 --> 1466.24
great concept

1464.96 --> 1468.24
right

1466.24 --> 1470.64
to really

1468.24 --> 1472.72
really make effort to get like great

1470.64 --> 1474.7990000000002
music for the game

1472.72 --> 1476.159
that really invested

1474.799 --> 1479.2
design

1476.159 --> 1481.5200000000002
great graphics like people that actually

1479.2 --> 1483.3600000000001
really care about just

1481.52 --> 1485.279
beauty and

1483.36 --> 1486.7199999999998
and make it like really

1485.279 --> 1490.08
cool to play

1486.72 --> 1492.159
right they just put extra time in that

1490.08 --> 1493.6
and effort and yeah it would become more

1492.159 --> 1496.159
expensive then

1493.6 --> 1496.1589999999999
logical

1496.559 --> 1501.279
would be a great time for for that right

1498.88 --> 1503.1200000000001
now i'd say

1501.279 --> 1508.72
although yeah the problem now is that's

1503.12 --> 1508.7199999999998
just too much effort spent on graphics

1509.6 --> 1515.52
and

1511.2 --> 1517.44
less time on just actually the yeah the

1515.52 --> 1519.84
experience

1517.44 --> 1519.8400000000001
i think

1520.159 --> 1523.1200000000001
like there's too many options now in

1522.159 --> 1526.24
games

1523.12 --> 1528.799
3d stuff and all that it's just like it

1526.24 --> 1532.96
really did kind of ruin

1528.799 --> 1534.4
the game experience 3d it it kind of did

1532.96 --> 1537.76
right

1534.4 --> 1540.159
i'm still like why why use 3d like i

1537.76 --> 1544.48
want to play baldur's gate a newer

1540.159 --> 1546.0800000000002
version that isn't 3d i just want the

1544.48 --> 1549.039
old style

1546.08 --> 1551.6789999999999
and like real effort for a really big

1549.039 --> 1554.4
new game with new story and new great

1551.679 --> 1556.64
music and new

1554.4 --> 1557.679
voices in there

1556.64 --> 1559.919
right

1557.679 --> 1561.8400000000001
the old amount of effort but also the

1559.919 --> 1563.679
old graphics why don't they do it why

1561.84 --> 1568.84
does it all have to be oh it's the

1563.679 --> 1571.2
newest engine of 3d also special oh

1568.84 --> 1571.6499999999999
yeah it sucks

1571.2 --> 1574.559
though

1571.65 --> 1576.799
[Music]

1574.559 --> 1579.9189999999999
you know

1576.799 --> 1582.24
like why are those retro games

1579.919 --> 1584.72
some there are like there are a fair

1582.24 --> 1586.64
amount of like retro type games out

1584.72 --> 1589.6000000000001
there right now that are pretty serious

1586.64 --> 1590.72
why are they so successful

1589.6 --> 1592.8799999999999
because

1590.72 --> 1596.0
they're they're old

1592.88 --> 1598.88
they just use the old systems

1596.0 --> 1600.72
and then perfect it with modern

1598.88 --> 1603.0390000000002
applications

1600.72 --> 1606.32
but it's the old system they don't do

1603.039 --> 1608.8799999999999
like oh we're we're the new version in

1606.32 --> 1608.8799999999999
3d

1610.72 --> 1616.24
so

1612.96 --> 1618.799
which by the way is a hilarious prospect

1616.24 --> 1620.24
if you realize that for a

1618.799 --> 1621.12
future

1620.24 --> 1622.88
of

1621.12 --> 1626.9599999999998
uh meta

1622.88 --> 1628.64
3d goggles oh yeah guess what 3d yeah

1626.96 --> 1630.24
you say

1628.64 --> 1631.679
well

1630.24 --> 1633.1200000000001
i think

1631.679 --> 1635.1200000000001
over time

1633.12 --> 1638.279
people are just going to be kind of sick

1635.12 --> 1638.279
of that

1649.36 --> 1654.9599999999998
that's right pgc net and it's a waste of

1651.84 --> 1657.76
time it's a waste of time even for the

1654.96 --> 1657.76
game companies

1659.84 --> 1665.9189999999999
right if they just made

1663.36 --> 1668.7199999999998
it's it they could keep it pretty basic

1665.919 --> 1670.96
if they just made like an exceptionally

1668.72 --> 1673.279
good game then they could make like two

1670.96 --> 1675.76
games on the side that were maybe a bit

1673.279 --> 1677.12
rushed and everybody

1675.76 --> 1679.279
would still

1677.12 --> 1682.7199999999998
love it because they made that one

1679.279 --> 1685.12
really good game

1682.72 --> 1687.3600000000001
right if you just keep on rushing things

1685.12 --> 1689.4399999999998
out and then you're just gonna like try

1687.36 --> 1690.7199999999998
to stay ahead of the disappointment

1689.44 --> 1692.48
curve

1690.72 --> 1693.919
people buy a game because it looked so

1692.48 --> 1696.24
beautiful then they played and then they

1693.919 --> 1698.3990000000001
get bored with it quickly and they're

1696.24 --> 1701.1200000000001
like yeah wow this game kind of sucks oh

1698.399 --> 1703.1999999999998
here look the new one the new oh look

1701.12 --> 1705.6789999999999
look at how promising it looks yeah this

1703.2 --> 1706.88
one is good yeah yeah

1705.679 --> 1709.2
yeah

1706.88 --> 1712.3990000000001
right st trying to stay ahead of the

1709.2 --> 1712.3990000000001
disappointment curve

1713.039 --> 1718.799
that sucks

1714.96 --> 1721.679
companies that do that become despised

1718.799 --> 1721.679
by the community

1722.559 --> 1727.2
and it's only the addicts

1724.799 --> 1728.24
that keep those companies

1727.2 --> 1730.559
up

1728.24 --> 1733.52
and running because people keep falling

1730.559 --> 1733.52
for their [ __ ]

1734.799 --> 1739.76
if some of them would just actually

1737.039 --> 1741.52
start making a great video game

1739.76 --> 1745.36
then they

1741.52 --> 1747.84
then you can actually get away with not

1745.36 --> 1749.279
super great optimal games right and then

1747.84 --> 1751.6789999999999
there's a likelihood that oh you have

1749.279 --> 1752.96
one version that didn't seem too great

1751.679 --> 1754.48
this and this is wrong with it okay

1752.96 --> 1756.96
let's make number two

1754.48 --> 1760.799
and then you fix it

1756.96 --> 1764.44
then you correct what was wrong about it

1760.799 --> 1764.44
this is just basics

1766.08 --> 1771.76
right replay value

1768.72 --> 1772.96
the real value of a game is the replay

1771.76 --> 1775.679
value

1772.96 --> 1777.2
that's the actual value of a game

1775.679 --> 1780.64
that means

1777.2 --> 1782.72
music is going to be important

1780.64 --> 1785.44
always

1782.72 --> 1786.48
if a game has sucky music or boring

1785.44 --> 1789.44
music

1786.48 --> 1789.44
it's a failure

1790.399 --> 1794.8799999999999
that's why when i am looking around for

1793.2 --> 1796.88
games

1794.88 --> 1799.3600000000001
first thing i pay attention to is the

1796.88 --> 1800.88
music if the music is good then the game

1799.36 --> 1805.399
can suck

1800.88 --> 1805.3990000000001
and i'll probably still play it

1830.159 --> 1833.8400000000001
you like red dead redemption

1832.64 --> 1835.5200000000002
yeah

1833.84 --> 1838.6399999999999
yeah but that game at least was

1835.52 --> 1838.6399999999999
successful right

1840.32 --> 1845.6789999999999
like it it had a point it like read that

1843.52 --> 1847.039
redemption is like

1845.679 --> 1850.3200000000002
westworld

1847.039 --> 1853.039
it's it's a westworld simulator that's

1850.32 --> 1855.039
what it seems like to me

1853.039 --> 1858.399
i've never played it myself but i've

1855.039 --> 1858.399
known people that played it

1858.799 --> 1865.519
they were very enthusiastic about it and

1860.799 --> 1869.6
south park made episodes about it

1865.519 --> 1869.6
because it was like a really good game

1870.0 --> 1873.48
one of the few

1881.32 --> 1888.0
yeah yeah yeah the amiga 1200 is

1886.0 --> 1890.159
is still epic

1888.0 --> 1893.12
still now

1890.159 --> 1897.6000000000001
there's some music

1893.12 --> 1897.6
from the amiga 1200 that is just like

1898.96 --> 1904.08
i think that the amiga 1200 sound system

1901.36 --> 1907.279
really is at the core of retro

1904.08 --> 1910.96
or for music because it just has the

1907.279 --> 1910.96
most amazing sound effects

1911.89 --> 1915.0790000000002
[Music]

1919.279 --> 1921.84
all right

1929.039 --> 1935.559
hey flatter sage it's been a while

1932.159 --> 1935.5590000000002
how are you doing

1938.72 --> 1943.29
cassette tapes corner 64. yeah yeah

1942.96 --> 1946.49
oh

1943.29 --> 1946.49
[Music]

1946.64 --> 1949.8400000000001
so hilarious

1970.559 --> 1975.12
all right but still what i loved the

1972.64 --> 1976.96
most about commodore 64 was that there

1975.12 --> 1978.799
were some games

1976.96 --> 1981.039
where you could literally build your own

1978.799 --> 1983.679
levels about whatever the game was like

1981.039 --> 1985.76
ball the dash construction kit pinball

1983.679 --> 1989.2
construction kit

1985.76 --> 1993.039
and other games all kinds of games

1989.2 --> 1996.0
like on a commodore 64.

1993.039 --> 1998.0
that's so epic that you could do that

1996.0 --> 2000.559
like

1998.0 --> 2003.36
that spurted me to like really want to

2000.559 --> 2006.08
learn everything about games

2003.36 --> 2008.32
and that made made me convinced like in

2006.08 --> 2011.76
my youth as a pre-teen and even in my

2008.32 --> 2014.08
teens that i'm gonna be a game designer

2011.76 --> 2016.0
that didn't really work out although

2014.08 --> 2016.799
yeah i did kind of

2016.0 --> 2018.88
go

2016.799 --> 2023.12
sort of in the direction game designer

2018.88 --> 2023.1200000000001
with dnd tabletop game

2030.48 --> 2034.32
bridging the experience i guess with

2033.2 --> 2036.8500000000001
more

2034.32 --> 2040.01
psychological things

2036.85 --> 2040.01
[Music]

2052.8 --> 2058.32
yeah dude that terry sound sucks

2058.839 --> 2066.48
oh atari was awesome the sound sucked

2064.32 --> 2069.3590000000004
and i know because my parents had an

2066.48 --> 2071.04
authority they kind of used it for

2069.359 --> 2072.56
music writing

2071.04 --> 2075.44
like my mother

2072.56 --> 2078.24
wrote her music books on an atari

2075.44 --> 2078.2400000000002
remember this

2082.639 --> 2089.839
like these

2084.0 --> 2089.839
these were all written made on an atari

2092.56 --> 2098.119
but the sound effects sucked so hard

2102.48 --> 2109.599
i hate meaty i can't stand beauty

2106.64 --> 2109.5989999999997
it's so annoying

2110.48 --> 2113.599
it just

2111.52 --> 2115.119
sounds weird but it just sounds gay to

2113.599 --> 2119.3590000000004
me

2115.119 --> 2122.8
i don't like midi sound effects at all

2119.359 --> 2125.359
i love commodore 64 sound effects

2122.8 --> 2129.42
and amiga is amazing

2125.359 --> 2132.5499999999997
atari is just

2129.42 --> 2132.55
[Music]

2135.96 --> 2141.48
[Music]

2137.839 --> 2141.48
yeah that's right pgcnet

2142.59 --> 2145.76
[Music]

2150.24 --> 2153.24
ugh

2163.92 --> 2167.359
superman

2165.359 --> 2170.48
64's utter trash

2167.359 --> 2173.68
yeah well flatter sage there were a lot

2170.48 --> 2176.56
of really stupid games for the commodore

2173.68 --> 2178.72
6 dude the amount of games

2176.56 --> 2180.7999999999997
for the commodore 64

2178.72 --> 2184.3199999999997
is mind boggling

2180.8 --> 2184.32
i think i'm not sure

2184.56 --> 2187.56
like

2188.48 --> 2191.359
yeah

2189.359 --> 2194.3199999999997
well probably the amount of games that

2191.359 --> 2196.48
exist since then has probably like

2194.32 --> 2199.2000000000003
become so much

2196.48 --> 2201.68
but i think that for a very long time

2199.2 --> 2204.3999999999996
the commodore 64 has been the record

2201.68 --> 2207.839
holder for the amount of games

2204.4 --> 2207.839
that were available for it

2209.44 --> 2214.7200000000003
dude there were i remember like my

2211.52 --> 2217.2
brother even like following magazines

2214.72 --> 2219.1189999999997
that literally had just like here is the

2217.2 --> 2223.5989999999997
code

2219.119 --> 2225.2000000000003
to program your own video game

2223.599 --> 2226.96
and my brother would do that and there's

2225.2 --> 2229.2799999999997
like a lot of people would do that and

2226.96 --> 2230.88
there were people that just made video

2229.28 --> 2234.6400000000003
games in their spare time moment of

2230.88 --> 2237.44
commodore 64 with the coding

2234.64 --> 2240.4
and as a result there were so

2237.44 --> 2242.8
many freaking amounts of video games

2240.4 --> 2245.599
it's insane

2242.8 --> 2248.48
like i've never been able

2245.599 --> 2250.32
to actually play every video game that i

2248.48 --> 2254.079
had on a disc

2250.32 --> 2254.079
even though i've had to think for like

2254.88 --> 2259.2000000000003
15 years

2256.4 --> 2262.1600000000003
it's just you never got to it

2259.2 --> 2263.52
it's too many video games

2262.16 --> 2266.16
i had like this

2263.52 --> 2268.4
these boxes of floppy disks and it's

2266.16 --> 2272.3199999999997
just like so i don't even know how many

2268.4 --> 2272.32
were on those it must have been like

2272.56 --> 2275.7999999999997
a thousand

2287.77 --> 2290.989
[Music]

2291.2 --> 2293.52
right

2296.4 --> 2300.96
and all the video games all got cracked

2298.64 --> 2303.2
by the way and then you can always like

2300.96 --> 2306.4
start up like oh you want unlimited time

2303.2 --> 2306.3999999999996
and limited lives

2308.88 --> 2312.96
right but some of those video games were

2310.8 --> 2314.8
so freaking hard there's just no way

2312.96 --> 2317.359
that you were even gonna

2314.8 --> 2319.599
try playing that without infinite lives

2317.359 --> 2321.37
because it just you could never

2319.599 --> 2322.96
get through it

2321.37 --> 2324.72
[Music]

2322.96 --> 2327.839
like not all the games that were made

2324.72 --> 2327.839
were actually balanced

2329.119 --> 2334.119
you'd be happy if it didn't just break

2338.6 --> 2341.71
[Music]

2358.4 --> 2364.2000000000003
i guess today we're talking about video

2361.2 --> 2364.2
games

2370.16 --> 2374.64
has any of you ever seen like the hot

2372.32 --> 2374.6400000000003
chase

2375.04 --> 2378.52
arcade game

2396.88 --> 2399.599
i'll show you

2408.839 --> 2412.7999999999997
1988 konami

2413.68 --> 2421.359
wow that's wow so then when i played it

2416.72 --> 2421.359
it was brand new when i was eight huh

2421.92 --> 2424.92
amazing

2435.92 --> 2439.16
come on

2442.64 --> 2444.96
right

2446.319 --> 2452.56
and the music was also pretty badass

2449.76 --> 2454.0
but look at this this is all 2d graphics

2452.56 --> 2455.359
all of it

2454.0 --> 2458.8
this is like

2455.359 --> 2463.2799999999997
mega mario kart before mario kart

2458.8 --> 2466.4
actually became like a console game

2463.28 --> 2469.599
it was all very railroaded though but it

2466.4 --> 2473.2000000000003
just was an amazing experience and what

2469.599 --> 2475.6800000000003
they did all of this with all 2d is just

2473.2 --> 2475.68
insane

2477.04 --> 2481.4
okay this is nothing to do with that

2482.0 --> 2486.319
and like it's super action-packed

2488.319 --> 2493.119
yeah this is the premise there is a bomb

2490.72 --> 2495.52
in your car it will explode soon time is

2493.119 --> 2497.76
running out and yeah that's it you just

2495.52 --> 2500.0
drive try to get to the checkpoint if

2497.76 --> 2502.4
you're too late your car blows up

2500.0 --> 2504.64
this is okay that's just correct

2502.4 --> 2504.64
so

2506.24 --> 2508.8799999999997
ends like

2507.68 --> 2511.1189999999997
yeah

2508.88 --> 2513.6800000000003
it's a total action movie

2511.119 --> 2517.0
and it makes no damn sense but it is is

2513.68 --> 2517.0
quite a rush

2522.16 --> 2526.3999999999996
has any of you ever played that in the

2524.0 --> 2526.4
arcade

2527.92 --> 2532.28
might have a different name in north

2529.28 --> 2532.28
america

2563.28 --> 2568.5600000000004
anyway if you love the 80s you'll love

2565.52 --> 2570.8
this game the the music is so freaking

2568.56 --> 2572.0
80s it's unbelievable

2570.8 --> 2572.8
this is

2572.0 --> 2575.2
uh

2572.8 --> 2575.2000000000003
whatever

2576.48 --> 2580.72
it's pretty tough game by the way

2578.8 --> 2584.2400000000002
although there were some people that

2580.72 --> 2585.839
just really knew how to play through it

2584.24 --> 2588.3999999999996
i think i like

2585.839 --> 2591.44
finished the game like only once

2588.4 --> 2593.67
i was really proud of that

2591.44 --> 2596.7490000000003
because it was pretty difficult

2593.67 --> 2596.7490000000003
[Music]

2598.0 --> 2601.0
anyway

2615.04 --> 2618.24
the golden x

2619.359 --> 2624.7999999999997
i don't know i've no i don't think i've

2621.28 --> 2629.5600000000004
ever played that metal slug soccer deal

2624.8 --> 2629.5600000000004
golden eggs never heard of that

2641.76 --> 2646.119
side scrolling beat him up

2653.44 --> 2655.76
huh

2656.88 --> 2662.76
uh i think i have actually seen this in

2659.599 --> 2662.76
the arcade

2672.96 --> 2677.839
yeah i think i might have actually

2674.72 --> 2677.839
played this

2680.96 --> 2686.48
i think it's like a really well made

2683.68 --> 2689.8799999999997
game but the graphics are like

2686.48 --> 2689.88
not the best

2703.2 --> 2705.839
hmm

2719.68 --> 2726.16
battletoads oh my god

2722.48 --> 2730.4
yeah battle touch is [ __ ] [ __ ] hard

2726.16 --> 2733.5989999999997
ghosts and goblins is brutal

2730.4 --> 2735.839
but i have actually played that game a

2733.599 --> 2735.839
lot

2736.319 --> 2741.599
and i've also finished it although never

2739.52 --> 2744.079
without unlimited lives

2741.599 --> 2749.6800000000003
but it's like even like finishing it

2744.079 --> 2749.6800000000003
with unlimited life is like a huge cure

2749.76 --> 2754.1600000000003
certain points that are just so

2751.52 --> 2756.319
difficult you'll be like dying at least

2754.16 --> 2758.319
10 times

2756.319 --> 2761.2
before you

2758.319 --> 2764.96
you get through there and then when you

2761.2 --> 2768.7599999999998
get through it's like oh my god

2764.96 --> 2768.76
i can make it

2778.16 --> 2784.0
hey adam price

2781.52 --> 2784.0
datum

2784.48 --> 2787.48
what

2789.04 --> 2793.88
did you just

2790.4 --> 2793.88
become a father

2796.78 --> 2799.9590000000003
[Music]

2802.96 --> 2806.88
oh the thing about ghost goblins once

2805.119 --> 2808.56
you beat it you realize you had to do it

2806.88 --> 2811.2000000000003
twice yeah well that's the point where i

2808.56 --> 2813.7599999999998
said go [ __ ] yourself

2811.2 --> 2817.0
i'm not doing that again

2813.76 --> 2817.0
this is

2817.599 --> 2822.2400000000002
maybe i i did it once but it must have

2820.16 --> 2824.24
been like in a real like no life

2822.24 --> 2827.2
situation where i just locked myself in

2824.24 --> 2827.2
my room in the dark

2827.92 --> 2831.839
so i might have actually played it

2829.599 --> 2834.0
through twice but i don't remember and

2831.839 --> 2835.92
if i did play it through twice that i i

2834.0 --> 2838.56
definitely remember that at the end of

2835.92 --> 2841.96
it i told myself i'm never doing that

2838.56 --> 2841.96
again ever

2854.64 --> 2861.8799999999997
molly and price ah

2857.04 --> 2861.88
congratulations adam that's so cool

2889.2 --> 2892.96
there's no wait yeah that's correct

2891.04 --> 2895.7599999999998
letter stage there isn't

2892.96 --> 2895.76
they literally

2895.92 --> 2901.76
it's physically like it doesn't continue

2899.599 --> 2903.92
they literally cheated

2901.76 --> 2906.48
the makers they're just like you're not

2903.92 --> 2909.44
going to finish playing this game

2906.48 --> 2911.92
because there is no end

2909.44 --> 2914.16
it just at some point you just can't get

2911.92 --> 2916.64
through anymore

2914.16 --> 2919.1189999999997
they just [ __ ] you up this is really

2916.64 --> 2919.1189999999997
nasty

2919.5 --> 2923.76
[Music]

2921.839 --> 2926.0
i don't remember exactly how they work

2923.76 --> 2928.3190000000004
but i i remember that about battle toads

2926.0 --> 2930.559
is that you can't actually finish it

2928.319 --> 2934.359
like it's impossible

2930.559 --> 2934.3590000000004
and they did it on purpose

2948.24 --> 2955.72
you can beat it as hard as [ __ ] no

2951.04 --> 2955.72
no at some point it gets stuck

2959.52 --> 2964.16
whoops oh [ __ ] i didn't even know about

2961.92 --> 2964.16
that

2969.68 --> 2973.359
maybe they corrected it later or

2971.599 --> 2976.1600000000003
something but i thought it was like a

2973.359 --> 2979.2799999999997
whole issue is like this game is not you

2976.16 --> 2981.7599999999998
can't finish this game

2979.28 --> 2984.8
but maybe they did after

2981.76 --> 2987.5200000000004
people figure that out they did like

2984.8 --> 2991.559
update it or something i don't remember

2987.52 --> 2991.559
it's a long time ago

3024.079 --> 3027.3590000000004
hmm

3025.04 --> 3029.839
yeah yeah i remember that too i got a

3027.359 --> 3029.839
dolphin

3030.88 --> 3035.92
it that wasn't like an exceptionally

3033.28 --> 3037.52
well made game with like the music is

3035.92 --> 3040.88
really awesome

3037.52 --> 3043.119
i don't even remem i i never played it

3040.88 --> 3044.4
i watched somebody else play it one time

3043.119 --> 3046.319
i think

3044.4 --> 3049.6800000000003
but that was like a little miracle at

3046.319 --> 3053.5589999999997
the time echo the dolphin

3049.68 --> 3053.5589999999997
was quite unique

3057.2 --> 3062.7599999999998
or at least so that the people think

3059.04 --> 3062.7599999999998
that got the game

3083.2 --> 3088.0789999999997
oh my god i come over do you need do you

3085.599 --> 3091.119
still need the freaking code you know

3088.079 --> 3091.119
the code for that

3091.68 --> 3096.68
that is such no nerdy

3099.76 --> 3104.1600000000003
i get it though when when i was really

3102.0 --> 3106.8
into games i'd learn those codes by

3104.16 --> 3109.359
heart too or i'd keep like a log book i

3106.8 --> 3111.52
had i used to have like a log book with

3109.359 --> 3113.68
codes

3111.52 --> 3116.48
of games

3113.68 --> 3119.8799999999997
it's a classic yeah yeah yeah

3116.48 --> 3119.88
sure it is

3130.88 --> 3133.88
hmm

3150.16 --> 3153.16
hey

3153.28 --> 3156.4790000000003
[Music]

3161.76 --> 3164.88
hmm okay so you can start with thanks

3163.599 --> 3166.88
for bringing it

3164.88 --> 3170.0
pulling us out of the video games i need

3166.88 --> 3173.28
to start talking about something else

3170.0 --> 3175.599
so yesterday this

3173.28 --> 3177.92
was awesome letters debate was pretty

3175.599 --> 3179.44
awesome

3177.92 --> 3181.119
although at some point it was a bit

3179.44 --> 3183.119
difficult because the show just kept

3181.119 --> 3185.44
going and going and going

3183.119 --> 3186.7200000000003
and in the meantime tony sleeping

3185.44 --> 3191.04
warrior had

3186.72 --> 3194.64
like a premiere where he went up against

3191.04 --> 3197.7599999999998
uh jam panda did anybody see that

3194.64 --> 3199.68
holy jesus

3197.76 --> 3202.1600000000003
like

3199.68 --> 3205.44
if you actually watch through that from

3202.16 --> 3209.2
beginning to end without pausing it or

3205.44 --> 3213.44
sign muting it and doing something else

3209.2 --> 3213.4399999999996
then you might need medical attention

3213.52 --> 3215.92
because

3214.48 --> 3220.359
ah

3215.92 --> 3220.359
jeff and i so

3223.04 --> 3227.92
headache i

3224.48 --> 3230.079
i had a headache from that thanks tony i

3227.92 --> 3233.2000000000003
can't believe that he actually did all

3230.079 --> 3233.2000000000003
that live with him

3234.96 --> 3239.359
where was that it was on the sleeping

3236.8 --> 3242.6400000000003
warrior channel

3239.359 --> 3246.0
that's how i felt yeah i can imagine

3242.64 --> 3248.24
god that was so bad

3246.0 --> 3250.64
it just wouldn't stop it's only gotten

3248.24 --> 3253.2
worse and worse and worse anyway i'll

3250.64 --> 3254.7999999999997
link you up

3253.2 --> 3257.68
sleeping warriors

3254.8 --> 3260.1600000000003
so you can check it out yourself

3257.68 --> 3263.16
but warning you're probably gonna get a

3260.16 --> 3263.16
headache

3267.119 --> 3273.28
it's two hours and 11 minutes and i did

3270.16 --> 3276.5989999999997
not watch every part of that if you know

3273.28 --> 3276.599
what i mean

3281.119 --> 3285.119
but it is basically yeah

3284.0 --> 3286.079
like

3285.119 --> 3290.88
the

3286.079 --> 3295.119
the most robust anti-flat earther

3290.88 --> 3295.119
interaction you probably have ever heard

3298.079 --> 3304.319
it's just non-stop projecting non-stop

3302.4 --> 3307.839
straw manning

3304.319 --> 3307.839
and just the constant

3308.16 --> 3312.16
assertion of victory and the peer

3310.16 --> 3314.5589999999997
pressure constant and then like turns

3312.16 --> 3317.2
out to be completely wrong and then he

3314.559 --> 3321.3190000000004
still claims like he's right just the

3317.2 --> 3321.319
guy is just unbearable

3321.68 --> 3324.0
ah

3327.44 --> 3332.48
and tony was just incredibly calm

3330.319 --> 3335.04
considering the circumstance he still

3332.48 --> 3335.76
well it got a bit shouty

3335.04 --> 3338.4
but

3335.76 --> 3341.3590000000004
i can't believe he's just

3338.4 --> 3341.359
derp fest yeah

3345.76 --> 3353.0
you got a lot of jam no no you don't

3349.599 --> 3353.0
i don't

3366.48 --> 3370.64
face palm protection videos

3374.96 --> 3379.44
right it's one of those videos where you

3376.96 --> 3382.079
need a helmet

3379.44 --> 3384.4
to prevent damage on the skin or

3382.079 --> 3388.92
accidentally pulling your hair out it's

3384.4 --> 3388.92
those type that type of video

3392.559 --> 3396.2400000000002
but yeah flutter of the [ __ ] yesterday

3394.24 --> 3398.3999999999996
was also very cool

3396.24 --> 3399.4399999999996
another guy got on there in the after

3398.4 --> 3401.92
show

3399.44 --> 3405.44
we thought he was like the pilot again

3401.92 --> 3409.839
but there was no confirmation of that

3405.44 --> 3412.7200000000003
but it was once again about coriolis

3409.839 --> 3412.72
very elaborate

3415.839 --> 3419.2799999999997
but definitely worth checking out some

3418.16 --> 3422.5589999999997
of it

3419.28 --> 3422.559
for as long as you can stomach

3422.72 --> 3426.799
i mean don't don't push yourself to

3425.04 --> 3428.079
watch the whole thing from beginning to

3426.799 --> 3431.28
end i mean

3428.079 --> 3431.28
i don't recommend it

3431.44 --> 3434.96
but at least take a look

3439.359 --> 3444.64
but it is a great example of what we are

3442.24 --> 3447.1189999999997
typically up against as

3444.64 --> 3451.52
flat earthers

3447.119 --> 3451.52
from the flat earth debate group mostly

3458.0 --> 3465.04
nathan came back to discord after

3460.799 --> 3465.04
the show no i did not akuma virus

3471.359 --> 3477.5589999999997
to do what

3473.839 --> 3477.5589999999997
he record it

3489.28 --> 3495.8390000000004
hey ben white there's so much confusion

3491.92 --> 3498.319
on the topic of coriolis yeah no [ __ ]

3495.839 --> 3501.2799999999997
that's their staple right they need to

3498.319 --> 3503.04
be confused about coriolis or

3501.28 --> 3506.079
it becomes blatantly obvious that the

3503.04 --> 3506.079
earth is not spinning

3512.24 --> 3517.9199999999996
did he record it

3514.96 --> 3520.799
right okay i didn't know that i kind of

3517.92 --> 3524.2400000000002
like we talked with the guys on the g

3520.799 --> 3527.04
plus panel separately and

3524.24 --> 3527.04
i had no idea

3528.559 --> 3531.559
right

3533.41 --> 3536.62
[Music]

3537.44 --> 3541.88
he's really clowning up a bit

3546.319 --> 3549.319
hmm

3555.78 --> 3558.9190000000003
[Music]

3570.839 --> 3576.16
right no akuma virus

3573.92 --> 3580.359
don't straw man nathan with something

3576.16 --> 3580.359
that you know he doesn't assert

3596.96 --> 3601.68
when you research it you'll find

3598.799 --> 3604.359
multiple definitions oh you mean

3601.68 --> 3607.2
you find the right definition and

3604.359 --> 3608.799
globiodus [ __ ] heliocentrism

3607.2 --> 3610.24
assertions yeah

3608.799 --> 3611.839
we know

3610.24 --> 3614.16
collobiolus

3611.839 --> 3616.24
is there too they call it coriolis it's

3614.16 --> 3619.52
obviously wrong

3616.24 --> 3619.52
it's not the same thing

3620.0 --> 3623.92
one

3621.04 --> 3626.88
has nothing to do with the other

3623.92 --> 3630.079
right globiolus is an actual deviation

3626.88 --> 3631.599
because of presumed presupposed earth

3630.079 --> 3634.4
spin

3631.599 --> 3635.92
coriolis effect isn't an actual

3634.4 --> 3640.2400000000002
deviation

3635.92 --> 3640.2400000000002
it's only an apparent deviation

3641.599 --> 3645.6800000000003
over

3642.559 --> 3645.6800000000003
it's just wrong

3646.72 --> 3652.3999999999996
globiotus is has nothing to do

3649.68 --> 3654.0
with reality it's

3652.4 --> 3656.319
all just

3654.0 --> 3660.0
non-coriolis presuppositional based

3656.319 --> 3662.319
assertions to confuse coriolis effect

3660.0 --> 3664.72
the thing that we would see if the earth

3662.319 --> 3666.72
were spinning and we don't

3664.72 --> 3668.8799999999997
it's all been designed specifically to

3666.72 --> 3669.8399999999997
distract you away from that

3668.88 --> 3673.039
right

3669.84 --> 3673.039
[Music]

3694.64 --> 3699.2799999999997
yes sure i could move virus

3698.16 --> 3700.799
sure

3699.28 --> 3702.4
why don't you take it up with nathan

3700.799 --> 3705.52
oakley again

3702.4 --> 3706.48
you explain you exactly

3705.52 --> 3711.079
why

3706.48 --> 3711.079
something would deviate to the east

3712.88 --> 3715.92
oh my god

3716.319 --> 3720.96
you were trying you're gonna talk about

3718.079 --> 3724.28
yeah i'm sure you were you got another

3720.96 --> 3724.28
chance today

3730.799 --> 3736.0
right so anyway before everybody goes

3733.039 --> 3737.44
away to the players debates or whatever

3736.0 --> 3741.119
guys please

3737.44 --> 3742.2400000000002
if you can support me through the paypal

3741.119 --> 3743.839
i'm like

3742.24 --> 3746.0789999999997
really on the edge of complete

3743.839 --> 3748.4
brokenness in the sense that i won't

3746.079 --> 3750.88
even be able to borrow money to get

3748.4 --> 3754.28
around anymore

3750.88 --> 3754.28
i need support

3766.4 --> 3771.599
so if you can please donate some to my

3769.359 --> 3774.64
paypal and i can just keep going without

3771.599 --> 3774.6400000000003
constant worrying

3777.92 --> 3783.599
do you believe in astrology what

3781.68 --> 3787.359
what

3783.599 --> 3789.76
that depends on what you mean with that

3787.359 --> 3793.0389999999998
or what what conclusions you're gonna

3789.76 --> 3795.039
draw from astrology

3793.039 --> 3797.119
i mean do you

3795.039 --> 3799.039
believe in

3797.119 --> 3800.48
the stars

3799.039 --> 3802.4
right

3800.48 --> 3805.359
yeah yeah i believe that they're stars

3802.4 --> 3807.6800000000003
that i can see them

3805.359 --> 3811.839
that there are little lights in

3807.68 --> 3811.839
that appear to be in the sky

3812.0 --> 3814.4
you know

3816.16 --> 3820.799
now do i believe there is a logic

3818.88 --> 3824.48
towards

3820.799 --> 3826.88
the celestial influence

3824.48 --> 3828.48
yeah there's very likely to be something

3826.88 --> 3830.6400000000003
to that

3828.48 --> 3833.76
although just because an astrologer

3830.64 --> 3836.0
could read something of a chart

3833.76 --> 3838.559
based on the system doesn't mean that

3836.0 --> 3840.96
i'm automatically like take that as

3838.559 --> 3840.96
given

3842.72 --> 3845.9199999999996
right because in the end it's all about

3844.4 --> 3848.559
frequency and then it's usually

3845.92 --> 3850.96
translated to words how a person would

3848.559 --> 3853.3590000000004
assimilate it

3850.96 --> 3855.839
with the suggestion right

3853.359 --> 3860.359
i'm just reading the frequency

3855.839 --> 3860.359
i don't take suggestions really

3870.88 --> 3874.4
people with certain signs in a certain

3873.28 --> 3877.8390000000004
way

3874.4 --> 3880.839
act in a certain way that is predictable

3877.839 --> 3880.839
no

3883.44 --> 3886.7200000000003
i do not believe in that

3889.28 --> 3894.559
what i do believe however is that a

3891.52 --> 3895.839
personality might

3894.559 --> 3898.48
adapt

3895.839 --> 3901.52
right it's like

3898.48 --> 3903.68
how you will grow will be influenced by

3901.52 --> 3906.68
i guess what constellation you were born

3903.68 --> 3906.68
under

3909.359 --> 3915.2
but how you act

3912.72 --> 3918.3999999999996
is different

3915.2 --> 3918.3999999999996
like that can be anything

3921.44 --> 3925.839
on the other hand a lot of people always

3923.2 --> 3928.319
told me like yeah you're a real aquarius

3925.839 --> 3930.4
and then i guess i'm like yeah yeah i am

3928.319 --> 3935.0
a real aquarius

3930.4 --> 3935.0
i guess i'm really an aquarius

3960.06 --> 3963.119
[Music]

3965.76 --> 3971.96
the psychology thing

3968.96 --> 3971.96
what

3984.72 --> 3989.2799999999997
well i do know that the moon position

3987.359 --> 3991.0389999999998
like how it is does influence me

3989.28 --> 3994.3190000000004
directly

3991.039 --> 3997.039
right but i'm not getting that from

3994.319 --> 3997.0389999999998
astrology

3998.88 --> 4004.359
okay fine

4001.119 --> 4004.359
all depends

4006.16 --> 4010.16
if you're going to

4007.44 --> 4012.799
do everything based on astrological

4010.16 --> 4014.48
system yeah that is kind of gay to be

4012.799 --> 4016.319
fair

4014.48 --> 4021.319
but

4016.319 --> 4021.319
astrology by itself is not gay

4047.039 --> 4051.76
why are you asking me that

4049.44 --> 4051.76
what

4057.2 --> 4061.1189999999997
dude

4059.039 --> 4063.28
why are you asking me psych bear why are

4061.119 --> 4067.2000000000003
you asking me a question like i'm a

4063.28 --> 4067.2000000000003
master astrologer or something

4067.52 --> 4070.079
i'm not

4071.76 --> 4076.88
i think that seeking star wars is

4073.76 --> 4080.4
probably a lot better at dealing with

4076.88 --> 4080.4
questions like that than i am

4086.0 --> 4091.16
okay tara thanks thanks for that

4094.24 --> 4099.04
i disagree though i mean yeah stupid

4097.12 --> 4100.88
