104.24 --> 109.67999999999999
be able to start the show today

107.04 --> 111.119
because obs update and then it just

109.68 --> 113.60000000000001
didn't start up anymore i had to

111.119 --> 115.52
reinstall it and like

113.6 --> 116.479
reconfigure a couple of things really

115.52 --> 120.399
weird

116.479 --> 120.399
but it's working again so hooray

121.04 --> 123.92
the weather today

124.64 --> 128.64
yeah

126.479 --> 130.64
it's kind of nice but it seems to be

128.64 --> 133.04
very traily

130.64 --> 135.51999999999998
today

133.04 --> 139.2
i've seen this morning a lot of trails

135.52 --> 139.20000000000002
being dumped all of a sudden so

140.08 --> 145.44000000000003
it would have probably been pretty blue

142.72 --> 147.44
clear skied weather today but now it's

145.44 --> 149.12
just hazy like that

147.44 --> 151.599
but still the sun's coming through

149.12 --> 151.59900000000002
plenty

151.68 --> 155.48000000000002
and it is kind of warm

159.12 --> 162.28
all right

174.48 --> 178.72
hello psycbear first in chat

177.36 --> 180.72000000000003
elise g

178.72 --> 184.35999999999999
good to see you

180.72 --> 184.35999999999999
how are you two doing

185.28 --> 193.44
it is friday the 2nd of september 2022.

190.319 --> 193.44
low pjc net

193.519 --> 197.519
let me check the temperature i feel

195.599 --> 200.64
better today

197.519 --> 202.87900000000002
by the way in comparison to yesterday

200.64 --> 202.879
uh

205.2 --> 211.04
did not have another

208.64 --> 214.0
evening with stomach ache and all that

211.04 --> 216.72
or you know what i mean

214.0 --> 218.959
it's 24 degrees celsius oh it says it's

216.72 --> 220.25
gonna get even warmer

218.959 --> 223.31900000000002
this weekend

220.25 --> 223.319
[Music]

225.36 --> 227.84
all right

233.599 --> 237.04
hey

234.56 --> 240.519
neil degrasse tyson lies tony whitcomb

237.04 --> 240.519
good to see you

244.56 --> 251.2
right so i don't have a title just yet

246.879 --> 251.2
but i'm pretty decently inspired

251.599 --> 255.51899999999998
yesterday the flat earth debates was

253.76 --> 259.84
oddly enough

255.519 --> 262.24
an extremely long episode again

259.84 --> 264.71999999999997
except not the the live show the live

262.24 --> 266.639
show just went to kind of the [ __ ]

264.72 --> 269.84000000000003
nathan apparently had a lot of technical

266.639 --> 269.84000000000003
difficulties so we just

271.199 --> 274.56
yeah

272.24 --> 277.04
rounded out

274.56 --> 277.04
early

278.24 --> 282.0
i wasn't even there most of the time so

280.24 --> 283.919
i kind of went out for groceries and

282.0 --> 286.72
then apparently the technical

283.919 --> 288.88
difficulties started when i came back

286.72 --> 290.88000000000005
which was very close to the rounding out

288.88 --> 292.88
time

290.88 --> 295.44
it turned out to be all technical i

292.88 --> 298.8
wasn't even in the panel because google

295.44 --> 298.8
plus apparently just quit

299.68 --> 302.0
and

300.639 --> 305.039
anyway

302.0 --> 305.039
nathan got it back

305.28 --> 311.28
and then the after show proceeded to be

308.0 --> 312.8
like three hours and it was another go

311.28 --> 316.0
at ether

312.8 --> 317.68
with die slow and witset even got back

316.0 --> 320.88
in there although he didn't like take

317.68 --> 322.72
the main steering wheel this time

320.88 --> 326.4
and i thought that the energy the

322.72 --> 328.32000000000005
overall energy was a lot more stable

326.4 --> 332.0
nathan did not get to a point where he

328.32 --> 332.0
just like really had to shout

332.88 --> 338.15999999999997
so it was long

335.199 --> 340.0
yet not super draining like the day

338.16 --> 342.0
before

340.0 --> 343.84
when i was yeah well yesterday i was

342.0 --> 345.919
completely exhausted because of the day

343.84 --> 348.4
before because of that five

345.919 --> 351.68
five hour show

348.4 --> 354.08
three of three and a half of them live

351.68 --> 356.8
but yesterday's show was incredibly long

354.08 --> 359.52
like we went up to like eight o'clock

356.8 --> 362.479
eight o'clock crazy

359.52 --> 366.15999999999997
but it was really interesting

362.479 --> 367.36
and the energy was just much more subtle

366.16 --> 370.40000000000003
no

367.36 --> 372.8
savonia complex outbursts

370.4 --> 377.4
no extreme double speaking it was a

372.8 --> 377.40000000000003
couple of moments but not super long

381.44 --> 386.16
so yeah yesterday's flat earth debate

383.28 --> 389.039
was really interesting i had some good

386.16 --> 389.03900000000004
moments in there

389.44 --> 394.479
and uh

391.68 --> 398.16
yeah

394.479 --> 398.15999999999997
wonder what today's show gonna be like

399.919 --> 404.639
right also

401.52 --> 406.79999999999995
right before the show i watched

404.639 --> 409.68
quantum of conscious

406.8 --> 412.479
who had a perplexing

409.68 --> 412.479
good video

413.12 --> 416.96
called the last conversation before you

415.36 --> 419.199
were born

416.96 --> 419.19899999999996
and

420.319 --> 424.72
i mean this is some seriously well

423.199 --> 426.88
thought through

424.72 --> 429.91900000000004
science fiction on his part he must have

426.88 --> 429.919
been working on this

430.16 --> 434.47900000000004
this telling for a long time

432.56 --> 438.72
because it is

434.479 --> 441.199
mind-blowing it is really mind-blowing

438.72 --> 443.759
because it seems like it's just

441.199 --> 445.68
really correct

443.759 --> 448.08000000000004
like this is even better than his

445.68 --> 451.52
standard lingo approach of when he just

448.08 --> 453.75899999999996
analyzes things out out here

451.52 --> 455.12
it kind of cuts corners a little well in

453.759 --> 459.36
here it just

455.12 --> 460.72
it's like having a conversation with god

459.36 --> 462.319
sort of

460.72 --> 465.12
it's really

462.319 --> 466.8
really fascinating so i'm extremely

465.12 --> 468.639
impressed by that and i definitely

466.8 --> 470.879
recommend that you guys check it out if

468.639 --> 472.40000000000003
you haven't already

470.879 --> 473.759
although that drives much of what they

472.4 --> 476.479
do oh

473.759 --> 479.28000000000003
thanks oh i love it i love it when i say

476.479 --> 482.31899999999996
open a new window then i hover over the

479.28 --> 485.35999999999996
window immediately and then i

482.319 --> 486.56
scroll down with right click say mute

485.36 --> 489.12
tab

486.56 --> 491.199
and then it starts playing anyway

489.12 --> 493.84000000000003
yay

491.199 --> 493.84000000000003
great

494.8 --> 501.52000000000004
not super annoying at all okay

498.479 --> 501.52
never mind uh

502.24 --> 507.28000000000003
just wanted to share the video so

504.96 --> 510.0
check it out it's an hour long

507.28 --> 511.039
i'm about 40 minutes in and just my mind

510.0 --> 513.84
is

511.039 --> 513.84
totally blown

514.56 --> 519.4399999999999
i think you introduced you to you yeah

516.88 --> 521.519
not surprised i i bring up regularly i

519.44 --> 524.08
mean not all of his work is great some

521.519 --> 525.92
of it is kind of eh but then he just

524.08 --> 528.8000000000001
comes out with things like this and he's

525.92 --> 528.8
just like whoa

528.88 --> 533.12
damn bro

530.399 --> 535.36
i mean that's like

533.12 --> 537.44
it almost feels like a spiritual

535.36 --> 538.72
asymmeth

537.44 --> 539.9200000000001
book

538.72 --> 542.399
except

539.92 --> 545.1999999999999
it's better

542.399 --> 547.36
it's just so detailed

545.2 --> 551.6
i just did share it

547.36 --> 551.6
good servant it's right there in chat

553.6 --> 559.9200000000001
oh oh and before before you uh get all

556.8 --> 562.8
triggered it's not christian

559.92 --> 564.3199999999999
it is extremely universal it's not

562.8 --> 567.12
christian

564.32 --> 569.0400000000001
so oh oh it doesn't work it doesn't work

567.12 --> 571.12
according to this and yeah yeah yeah

569.04 --> 572.399
well this is kind of like three layers

571.12 --> 576.2
above that

572.399 --> 576.2
and it really is

580.56 --> 585.279
right anyway i gotta

582.399 --> 588.24
still finish watching it

585.279 --> 591.6
and maybe even re-watch it

588.24 --> 593.04
there's one to to take in and don't

591.6 --> 596.48
what

593.04 --> 599.04
what you don't see it

596.48 --> 599.04
what do you mean

602.32 --> 608.9590000000001
does anybody else not see the link that

605.04 --> 608.959
i just posted 124

609.76 --> 615.16
i'm seeing it

612.16 --> 615.16
right

621.6 --> 626.8000000000001
let me refresh yeah that seems like a

624.16 --> 626.8
good idea

628.16 --> 631.56
right anyway

642.0 --> 646.12
yeah you see it now all right

653.68 --> 656.68
right

668.64 --> 671.519
all right good server

670.24 --> 675.64
yeah that's great then you're probably

671.519 --> 675.64
not gonna get triggered by that

680.079 --> 685.04
it's just really funny in a way i wonder

683.04 --> 688.36
if matt's been like working together

685.04 --> 688.36
with machowski

691.279 --> 695.76
on that because

692.88 --> 699.12
well they they do basically sit on the

695.76 --> 701.36
same website if you had noticed

699.12 --> 701.36
and

701.519 --> 704.8
free voice

702.959 --> 707.1199999999999
dot io

704.8 --> 707.12
i mean

708.0 --> 712.56
yes matt mckinley is most of the videos

710.32 --> 715.279
but then you you find a video from howdy

712.56 --> 717.68
machowski so they might might have

715.279 --> 721.04
worked together on this

717.68 --> 721.04
well on this dialogue

722.32 --> 727.0400000000001
that matt basically made

725.04 --> 729.519
because it's just really

727.04 --> 732.3199999999999
really well thought through

729.519 --> 732.32
very careful

733.36 --> 738.48
trying he's tired of you trying to

735.76 --> 741.12
convert it dude there's no [ __ ] way

738.48 --> 744.16
that's ever gonna happen

741.12 --> 745.519
your your conversion is three levels

744.16 --> 746.959
lower

745.519 --> 748.72
than what he's

746.959 --> 751.7199999999999
like playing around with there's no

748.72 --> 751.72
point

760.0 --> 763.6
all right

761.04 --> 763.5999999999999
that's like

766.56 --> 773.4399999999999
it's like training a a

769.2 --> 776.8000000000001
a veteran police dog to sit

773.44 --> 778.0
right that's what you're trying to do

776.8 --> 779.68
come on

778.0 --> 783.0
this is

779.68 --> 783.0
kind of pointless

788.0 --> 792.72
so yeah don't just just listen just

790.88 --> 795.04
listen in

792.72 --> 798.1600000000001
you can of course always leave a comment

795.04 --> 800.3199999999999
there if it's on youtube and then

798.16 --> 802.079
reflect on how you see with your

800.32 --> 805.279
christian perspective

802.079 --> 809.1999999999999
but do not expect him to actually give a

805.279 --> 811.68
[ __ ] it's for you it's your reflection

809.2 --> 814.399
that you can share to be understood by

811.68 --> 815.1999999999999
those who care about that

814.399 --> 817.68
and

815.2 --> 821.0400000000001
well self-reflect you can't expect him

817.68 --> 822.7199999999999
to actually give a [ __ ] about your

821.04 --> 824.16
level one

822.72 --> 825.519
conversion

824.16 --> 828.519
impulse

825.519 --> 828.519
seriously

839.44 --> 843.839
but anyway

841.04 --> 843.8389999999999
uh

844.32 --> 850.72
that was the first video of a map

847.04 --> 850.7199999999999
that i saw a few years ago

851.839 --> 854.9590000000001
it is

853.68 --> 856.88
hmm

854.959 --> 857.8389999999999
that's weird he might have said that he

856.88 --> 860.16
had

857.839 --> 862.399
i think it was a redoing

860.16 --> 862.399
then

865.6 --> 869.44
okay i'm

867.12 --> 871.36
this might be like version number two

869.44 --> 873.519
with updates

871.36 --> 875.6800000000001
then

873.519 --> 877.6
if that is the case

875.68 --> 879.3599999999999
at legit thank you for telling me i

877.6 --> 881.1990000000001
think he might have actually said it

879.36 --> 883.44
like this is like something i already

881.199 --> 885.8389999999999
did but i had to redo it i don't know

883.44 --> 886.9590000000001
i'm not sure it was just short sentence

885.839 --> 888.9590000000001
in there

886.959 --> 890.6389999999999
i mean it's an hour long

888.959 --> 893.6389999999999
it might have mentioned it once at the

890.639 --> 893.639
beginning

908.0 --> 912.399
and it's fun i think i actually did hear

911.04 --> 914.0
i do now

912.399 --> 915.36
now that you're mentioning i think i do

914.0 --> 918.959
remember

915.36 --> 921.36
having seen that video before

918.959 --> 924.079
except for some reason back then i was

921.36 --> 926.0790000000001
completely uninterested

924.079 --> 928.3199999999999
which happened sometimes it's like when

926.079 --> 930.8
you're really preoccupied with something

928.32 --> 932.8000000000001
very specific like your own you're

930.8 --> 934.639
trying to reforge elements about

932.8 --> 937.199
yourself and you're really focused on

934.639 --> 938.8
that well when somebody like matt then

937.199 --> 939.92
brings out a video like that that is

938.8 --> 942.639
like

939.92 --> 945.199
absurd level esoterics

942.639 --> 947.279
it's like pulling you away from your

945.199 --> 950.399
focus of trying to do what you feel you

947.279 --> 952.079
need to do so i'm like yeah go away matt

950.399 --> 954.8
you're annoying

952.079 --> 957.68
that's my response then or i think it

954.8 --> 960.24
was my response back then

957.68 --> 963.56
but now it was like a perfect timing to

960.24 --> 963.5600000000001
watch it

980.959 --> 985.68
right but i think he's also updated it

983.6 --> 988.0
and

985.68 --> 990.8
basically made it better it would almo

988.0 --> 992.72
like if he would have posted this video

990.8 --> 993.5999999999999
the one that he's made out of it right

992.72 --> 995.0400000000001
now

993.6 --> 996.9590000000001
back then

995.04 --> 1000.24
there's a good chance that it might have

996.959 --> 1002.079
gotten gotten my ear at the time

1000.24 --> 1003.6
because

1002.079 --> 1006.079
just

1003.6 --> 1007.6800000000001
there is a lot of weird flubbiness i

1006.079 --> 1009.279
don't know how else to express it

1007.68 --> 1011.92
flubbiness

1009.279 --> 1013.6
within matt's way of describing things

1011.92 --> 1015.12
sometimes especially when he's

1013.6 --> 1017.1990000000001
improvising

1015.12 --> 1020.32
and so especially if he when he digs

1017.199 --> 1022.8
freshly into some esoteric deep [ __ ]

1020.32 --> 1025.839
then he gets flubbiness he didn't have

1022.8 --> 1029.36
that in this it was purely

1025.839 --> 1031.12
a pure fractal no flubbiness

1029.36 --> 1033.039
yeah you try and figure out what that

1031.12 --> 1035.28
means i i don't know just calling it

1033.039 --> 1038.16
flubbiness hopefully that'll

1035.28 --> 1040.799
ring a bell somehow

1038.16 --> 1041.76
it just gets a bit sloppy or something

1040.799 --> 1044.799
because

1041.76 --> 1046.64
or gets a bit goofy with it and i do not

1044.799 --> 1048.079
appreciate that when you talk about

1046.64 --> 1050.72
esoterics

1048.079 --> 1053.6789999999999
but there was no goofiness no flubbiness

1050.72 --> 1055.3600000000001
in this video at all

1053.679 --> 1056.48
i don't know if there was any in the

1055.36 --> 1057.6789999999999
original

1056.48 --> 1059.919
because i don't remember it because it

1057.679 --> 1062.0800000000002
was years ago

1059.919 --> 1062.0800000000002
but

1062.48 --> 1066.52
i don't know where i'm going with this

1078.559 --> 1081.559
right

1084.64 --> 1089.2800000000002
yeah that's right professing to be wise

1087.76 --> 1091.2
is foolish

1089.28 --> 1094.3999999999999
because the only way to

1091.2 --> 1097.1200000000001
profess to be wise is by demonstrating

1094.4 --> 1097.1200000000001
the wisdom

1097.28 --> 1103.9189999999999
if you just say you're wise that's

1100.16 --> 1103.919
like almost paradoxical

1104.16 --> 1107.52
by the way nobody says that about

1105.919 --> 1109.2800000000002
themselves

1107.52 --> 1111.6
unless you're like

1109.28 --> 1113.84
like i'm a little wiser than that you

1111.6 --> 1116.799
that is still doable but nobody just

1113.84 --> 1118.799
says i am really wise

1116.799 --> 1121.039
because it just

1118.799 --> 1123.36
it is like counterproductive

1121.039 --> 1126.0
because you have to like it has to be

1123.36 --> 1127.6789999999999
demonstrated that it is there to the

1126.0 --> 1130.96
observer in order to gain that

1127.679 --> 1134.0
recognition you can't just say wise

1130.96 --> 1137.3600000000001
the word wise means absolutely nothing

1134.0 --> 1140.36
especially if you put it on yourself

1137.36 --> 1140.36
anyway

1152.4 --> 1156.16
right in generalized talking by the way

1154.72 --> 1159.44
because if you're just gonna like

1156.16 --> 1163.44
describe specific factors about yourself

1159.44 --> 1165.52
then you could use wisdom as a category

1163.44 --> 1168.24
typically in dungeons and dragons this

1165.52 --> 1169.9189999999999
happens i mean there's a wisdom score

1168.24 --> 1172.08
which is kind of ridiculous because

1169.919 --> 1173.679
that's not really how wisdom works at

1172.08 --> 1177.1999999999998
all

1173.679 --> 1180.3200000000002
but that way you could still

1177.2 --> 1183.039
within like for example an analytical

1180.32 --> 1184.08
or self analytical description you could

1183.039 --> 1186.799
still

1184.08 --> 1189.6
say like oh yeah i'm pretty wise but

1186.799 --> 1193.76
that would be more like an attribute

1189.6 --> 1196.08
than like a universal phrase of wisdom

1193.76 --> 1198.559
anyway i don't know why i'm harping on

1196.08 --> 1198.559
about this

1200.72 --> 1207.84
hello savage giraffe okay hello susie s

1204.96 --> 1207.8400000000001
good to see you

1213.039 --> 1217.84
yeah of course good evening

1215.44 --> 1220.8400000000001
it is evening for you susie

1217.84 --> 1220.84
right

1238.96 --> 1245.0
oh love my content oh thank you

1241.28 --> 1245.0
i appreciate that

1252.159 --> 1254.96
wow

1253.2 --> 1257.8400000000001
damn

1254.96 --> 1261.1200000000001
you've been around for a while

1257.84 --> 1265.1589999999999
january 2010 huh

1261.12 --> 1265.1589999999999
that's an old account

1284.559 --> 1289.559
look at your date

1286.559 --> 1289.559
okay

1293.6 --> 1298.7199999999998
oh yeah yeah december 2011 yeah that's

1296.24 --> 1302.6
also pretty long

1298.72 --> 1302.6000000000001
mine is not that old

1306.159 --> 1311.0390000000002
i was actually extremely hesitant to

1308.88 --> 1313.3600000000001
start my own youtube account

1311.039 --> 1314.48
it was purely because of the flat earth

1313.36 --> 1316.84
debates

1314.48 --> 1319.2
i mean yeah because of flat earth that i

1316.84 --> 1321.039
eventually said like okay screw it i

1319.2 --> 1322.96
don't have a choice i have to throw this

1321.039 --> 1324.8799999999999
out now or i'm gonna be sorry the rest

1322.96 --> 1328.799
of my life

1324.88 --> 1328.7990000000002
for however long that's gonna last

1328.96 --> 1332.919
so yeah 2016.

1334.48 --> 1338.24
but i did get really active immediately

1337.2 --> 1340.48
so

1338.24 --> 1343.84
my channel is definitely a channel

1340.48 --> 1343.84
channel and not just a

1343.919 --> 1349.6000000000001
yeah a chat participant channel

1347.2 --> 1349.6000000000001
anyway

1350.24 --> 1354.72
yeah if you just seen it 2008 wow

1357.36 --> 1362.8799999999999
right

1358.96 --> 1362.88
yeah so it's just a browsing channel

1371.12 --> 1375.84
hey mother celine good to see you

1394.88 --> 1398.64
thought about making content

1396.72 --> 1399.679
right well only look

1398.64 --> 1403.2
you don't

1399.679 --> 1404.96
have to do that unless you want it right

1403.2 --> 1406.72
if that is something that you want to do

1404.96 --> 1408.72
and you actually want to do it it's not

1406.72 --> 1409.52
just a fantasy you want to try out one

1408.72 --> 1411.44
time

1409.52 --> 1415.4
you do that too

1411.44 --> 1415.4
yeah then you should do it

1419.039 --> 1422.799
i mean it sounds kind of weird but i

1420.64 --> 1424.4
really did always wanted to have my own

1422.799 --> 1427.279
show

1424.4 --> 1430.48
like as soon as i

1427.279 --> 1433.12
rolled into this subject

1430.48 --> 1435.2
i was just really nervous to do that

1433.12 --> 1437.12
until nathan

1435.2 --> 1439.1200000000001
basically told me like yeah maybe you

1437.12 --> 1442.8799999999999
should do your own show separate so you

1439.12 --> 1446.559
don't blabber over us all the time

1442.88 --> 1450.3200000000002
i was like oh okay i'll do it then

1446.559 --> 1451.6789999999999
right i guess i needed to be challenged

1450.32 --> 1455.08
in order to

1451.679 --> 1455.0800000000002
to go there

1460.159 --> 1465.919
i have almost 500 000 views what

1465.12 --> 1466.7199999999998
me

1465.919 --> 1467.76
no

1466.72 --> 1469.76
what

1467.76 --> 1474.4
what are you talking about i don't think

1469.76 --> 1474.4
so i think it's in the direction is it

1474.799 --> 1480.36
i thought i was like a hundred thousand

1477.36 --> 1480.36
views

1494.08 --> 1498.039
we're gonna see that again

1515.12 --> 1520.2399999999998
that that thing used to be like on the

1517.679 --> 1523.72
front page in youtube studio now can't

1520.24 --> 1523.72
find it anymore

1544.159 --> 1547.2
but yeah i did get a notification for

1546.24 --> 1551.1200000000001
like a

1547.2 --> 1555.52
100 000 hours so that was a month ago

1551.12 --> 1558.1589999999999
i don't know about this 500 000 views

1555.52 --> 1558.1589999999999
not sure

1562.08 --> 1569.0
the bottom of the about page oh really

1566.0 --> 1569.0
hmm

1570.559 --> 1574.0
oh

1571.44 --> 1574.0
you're right

1578.48 --> 1582.559
yeah 4.4

1581.279 --> 1585.2
is that a lot

1582.559 --> 1587.52
i don't no is that a lot

1585.2 --> 1590.96
i mean try to compare that to like

1587.52 --> 1590.96
nathan oakley's channel i mean

1593.84 --> 1599.84
let me compare it i think he must have

1595.52 --> 1599.84
had like millions by now

1603.76 --> 1608.799
yeah

1605.08 --> 1611.1999999999998
6.7 million

1608.799 --> 1611.2
right

1611.84 --> 1620.0
then again he has

1614.24 --> 1620.0
well literally 10 times my subscriber so

1621.039 --> 1627.0
i guess that evens out sorta

1624.0 --> 1627.0
anyway

1647.279 --> 1652.36
it's okay gorzilla thanks for that

1659.36 --> 1666.6789999999999
in the double slit isn't the photon

1661.2 --> 1666.679
described as a particle yes yes it is

1668.24 --> 1672.32
and

1670.48 --> 1674.799
to be fair in

1672.32 --> 1676.0
all experiments in which light is

1674.799 --> 1677.36
actually

1676.0 --> 1678.48
involved

1677.36 --> 1681.1999999999998
it is

1678.48 --> 1683.679
designated a particle

1681.2 --> 1684.64
there's no experiments of light as a

1683.679 --> 1687.44
wave

1684.64 --> 1687.44
there aren't any

1691.76 --> 1698.48
i mean there's been wave conclusions but

1694.88 --> 1700.0
those are outside there those are extra

1698.48 --> 1701.76
experimental

1700.0 --> 1704.559
they're not part of the experiment

1701.76 --> 1706.1589999999999
there's no conclusion or model in an

1704.559 --> 1708.32
experiment

1706.159 --> 1711.44
where it is treated as a light wave

1708.32 --> 1715.2
because it's not it's it is

1711.44 --> 1717.279
assumed to be a particle

1715.2 --> 1720.159
that doesn't mean that it isn't

1717.279 --> 1721.279
like an atom

1720.159 --> 1723.1200000000001
what

1721.279 --> 1725.84
the [ __ ] are you doing

1723.12 --> 1725.84
clutch

1729.12 --> 1731.36
well

1733.12 --> 1736.76
the hell was that

1752.64 --> 1757.96
yeah well caught there clutch what the

1754.96 --> 1757.96
[ __ ]

1779.36 --> 1785.4399999999998
atoms are mostly empty space

1782.88 --> 1787.5200000000002
no atoms are just a model

1785.44 --> 1789.8400000000001
they're just a model

1787.52 --> 1793.6399999999999
framework

1789.84 --> 1793.6399999999999
not dark yet

1795.2 --> 1799.2
the idea

1796.72 --> 1802.08
has been uttered out there that atoms

1799.2 --> 1804.24
are mostly empty space but that is part

1802.08 --> 1806.48
of their model and then like the science

1804.24 --> 1810.159
fiction expansion

1806.48 --> 1811.919
upon thinking about it like that

1810.159 --> 1814.3990000000001
right there's no actual proof for that

1811.919 --> 1815.919
at all it's all conceptual by the way

1814.399 --> 1818.0
dank thank you

1815.919 --> 1821.7990000000002
paypal

1818.0 --> 1821.799
that is most welcome

1834.0 --> 1838.96
thank

1834.84 --> 1838.9599999999998
you thank you dank

1839.12 --> 1841.84
huh

1840.72 --> 1844.96
that is

1841.84 --> 1844.9599999999998
extremely helpful

1848.32 --> 1851.32
wow

1856.24 --> 1860.96
thank you so much man

1858.96 --> 1863.1200000000001
love the show i'm so happy about that

1860.96 --> 1865.2
i'm not sure sometimes if i'm even that

1863.12 --> 1866.7199999999998
interesting anymore i just i just keep

1865.2 --> 1869.679
on going

1866.72 --> 1871.679
i just hope it's worth it because

1869.679 --> 1874.48
i don't know i just i guess i just kind

1871.679 --> 1876.3200000000002
of feel miserable sometimes and then i

1874.48 --> 1878.48
just try to distract the way because i

1876.32 --> 1879.84
just have to go

1878.48 --> 1881.2
but then i just

1879.84 --> 1884.0
when i feel miserable when i have to

1881.2 --> 1886.799
distract my self away from that in order

1884.0 --> 1888.48
to just keep going and i don't always

1886.799 --> 1889.76
like

1888.48 --> 1891.679
see

1889.76 --> 1893.44
what it is i'm doing

1891.679 --> 1896.3200000000002
i'm doing something i know it's gonna

1893.44 --> 1898.72
work but i don't then have the

1896.32 --> 1900.32
connection to what i'm actually doing as

1898.72 --> 1903.1200000000001
much

1900.32 --> 1904.08
so sometimes when i just have like a lot

1903.12 --> 1906.559
of like

1904.08 --> 1908.399
stomach issues and stuff i'm just like

1906.559 --> 1909.9189999999999
okay i hope i'm doing something

1908.399 --> 1912.399
interesting i really hope this is

1909.919 --> 1913.76
interesting because i can't really tell

1912.399 --> 1916.1589999999999
it just

1913.76 --> 1919.039
it won't sink

1916.159 --> 1920.3990000000001
it's like i can't digest my own work or

1919.039 --> 1921.84
something

1920.399 --> 1924.559
weird

1921.84 --> 1928.08
so i really appreciate the support and

1924.559 --> 1930.799
yeah and the compliment thank you guys

1928.08 --> 1930.799
thank you dank

1932.72 --> 1936.48
right and well

1934.799 --> 1940.08
i mean these are interesting times the

1936.48 --> 1943.2
ether wars have just broken out

1940.08 --> 1943.1999999999998
that is what that was

1944.72 --> 1951.919
that is what wednesday was it was the

1947.44 --> 1951.919
break of the ether ether wars

1953.679 --> 1958.0800000000002
and it's gonna it's gonna continue for a

1955.919 --> 1960.88
while it's gonna be very intense it's

1958.08 --> 1963.12
it's basically gonna be the new thing

1960.88 --> 1964.88
that we are going to be able to deal

1963.12 --> 1966.9599999999998
with

1964.88 --> 1968.64
and it's not even that new by the way

1966.96 --> 1971.1200000000001
it's been out there for a while but now

1968.64 --> 1973.919
is like the time the the breaking of the

1971.12 --> 1977.559
dawn now is when suddenly

1973.919 --> 1977.5590000000002
it's gonna go ahead

1983.84 --> 1987.36
i'll double that donation if you fix

1986.24 --> 1990.36
grab this

1987.36 --> 1990.36
what

1992.559 --> 1997.2
yeah i'd love to fix gravity for you

1994.88 --> 2000.72
stephanie graffiti but i don't know what

1997.2 --> 2000.72
it is can you tell me

2000.88 --> 2007.8400000000001
what is it

2002.799 --> 2008.6399999999999
like palpably not within math or within

2007.84 --> 2012.32
a

2008.64 --> 2014.0800000000002
conceptual thing but what is it oh that

2012.32 --> 2018.36
okay

2014.08 --> 2018.36
okay fine the [ __ ] off then

2019.2 --> 2022.799
who will win yeah who do you think will

2021.039 --> 2025.039
win

2022.799 --> 2027.039
ether is just an aberration it's the

2025.039 --> 2029.919
next aberration

2027.039 --> 2032.64
it's like gravity except it's more than

2029.919 --> 2036.5590000000002
gravity it's more of an aberration than

2032.64 --> 2040.64
gravity it is so big that the entire

2036.559 --> 2043.12
20th century scientific community like

2040.64 --> 2045.519
almost every one of them

2043.12 --> 2046.559
have been caught up in ether at some

2045.519 --> 2049.119
point

2046.559 --> 2052.24
and i don't even mean like flat earthers

2049.119 --> 2054.3990000000003
because this goes beyond flat earth

2052.24 --> 2057.359
it's in everything

2054.399 --> 2061.1189999999997
every scientific

2057.359 --> 2064.0789999999997
element or data element involving

2061.119 --> 2067.359
the analysis and description of light

2064.079 --> 2071.2000000000003
has been expressed using expressions and

2067.359 --> 2073.119
language that involve waves every single

2071.2 --> 2076.56
aspect yet

2073.119 --> 2076.56
it isn't a wave

2076.72 --> 2082.0789999999997
it's like the biggest on purpose screw

2079.679 --> 2086.04
job in the scientific community the

2082.079 --> 2086.04
entire 20th century

2092.0 --> 2096.8
purely by naming

2094.32 --> 2099.6800000000003
because it is in the way but oh we don't

2096.8 --> 2101.76
know how else to describe what we're

2099.68 --> 2106.7999999999997
analyzing about the light yeah yeah

2101.76 --> 2106.8
that's fair enough but it isn't a wave

2107.839 --> 2113.52
light light is not a wave

2111.52 --> 2115.04
i mean

2113.52 --> 2116.72
what kind of a question is that

2115.04 --> 2117.7599999999998
professor phil bell

2116.72 --> 2120.64
i mean

2117.76 --> 2123.44
any second in this period of time if i

2120.64 --> 2126.0789999999997
mention the word wave you'll bet your

2123.44 --> 2127.839
freaking ass it's gonna be about light

2126.079 --> 2129.76
not being it

2127.839 --> 2134.32
this is the ether wars this is the

2129.76 --> 2134.32
breaking of the ether wars

2137.2 --> 2142.839
no i definitely behave like a wave no it

2139.68 --> 2146.0789999999997
doesn't and it isn't a wave you numpty

2142.839 --> 2147.44
[ __ ] how does a prism work

2146.079 --> 2149.599
it breaks

2147.44 --> 2150.8
light because lights

2149.599 --> 2152.2400000000002
light

2150.8 --> 2155.6800000000003
is a beam

2152.24 --> 2158.4799999999996
it's an infinitely divisible beam

2155.68 --> 2163.2799999999997
and what a prism does it breaks that

2158.48 --> 2165.76
infinitely divisible nature of beams up

2163.28 --> 2170.1600000000003
and splits it up

2165.76 --> 2173.28
in different weird aspects of it

2170.16 --> 2174.3999999999996
because apparently you can do that and

2173.28 --> 2176.96
then

2174.4 --> 2178.96
yeah you get this weird spectrum

2176.96 --> 2180.2400000000002
thing

2178.96 --> 2183.28
why

2180.24 --> 2186.3199999999997
because light is really freaking

2183.28 --> 2187.44
mysterious that's why light is the only

2186.32 --> 2190.7200000000003
thing

2187.44 --> 2191.92
that actually has a diffraction cascade

2190.72 --> 2194.7999999999997
ability

2191.92 --> 2198.079
the only thing

2194.8 --> 2201.599
it is so unique in that aspect that we

2198.079 --> 2203.2000000000003
literally have no other association in

2201.599 --> 2204.079
the world

2203.2 --> 2206.64
with

2204.079 --> 2209.6800000000003
diffraction patterns like that comes out

2206.64 --> 2212.4
of light there's no other association

2209.68 --> 2214.7999999999997
it's that freaking mysterious light is

2212.4 --> 2216.32
really mysterious in its substantial

2214.8 --> 2217.599
nature

2216.32 --> 2221.04
and i think

2217.599 --> 2225.3590000000004
my infinitely divisible beam model is

2221.04 --> 2227.92
extremely on point i came up with it

2225.359 --> 2231.2799999999997
basically a reflection to a realization

2227.92 --> 2231.28
when i was 12.

2231.359 --> 2236.4
when i first heard

2233.359 --> 2238.3199999999997
about all of this scientific stuff

2236.4 --> 2241.839
through my brother learning on the

2238.32 --> 2244.2400000000002
university for the very first time first

2241.839 --> 2247.04
time i heard it i knew i knew

2244.24 --> 2250.0
immediately

2247.04 --> 2251.32
a very [ __ ] first time i heard about

2250.0 --> 2253.119
it i knew

2251.32 --> 2256.48
immediately

2253.119 --> 2258.88
nobody had to tell me i knew it

2256.48 --> 2261.599
it is in a way it isn't a particle it's

2258.88 --> 2265.359
something else and everybody's just

2261.599 --> 2265.3590000000004
being a dumbass about it

2265.599 --> 2270.8
infinitely divisible beam is the

2268.16 --> 2274.24
conclusion that i came to over the

2270.8 --> 2274.2400000000002
course of 30 years

2280.24 --> 2284.72
how would a particle resolve itself at a

2282.64 --> 2286.64
long distance it wouldn't it makes

2284.72 --> 2288.9599999999996
absolutely no freaking sense good

2286.64 --> 2291.04
servant also a particle has an

2288.96 --> 2292.7200000000003
antecedent of travel

2291.04 --> 2295.04
and light doesn't travel it's

2292.72 --> 2297.5989999999997
instantaneous

2295.04 --> 2299.04
it is a manifesting thing

2297.599 --> 2300.6400000000003
just

2299.04 --> 2301.52
it's there

2300.64 --> 2304.0789999999997
bang

2301.52 --> 2306.079
beam infinitely divisible

2304.079 --> 2308.2400000000002
manifest it's there

2306.079 --> 2309.52
instantaneous no travel

2308.24 --> 2311.4399999999996
no wave

2309.52 --> 2312.88
no ripple

2311.44 --> 2316.7200000000003
nothing

2312.88 --> 2316.7200000000003
it's there being instantaneous

2324.079 --> 2327.52
has anyone seen rum yeah he's still out

2326.079 --> 2330.0
there bren cook i think he's hanging

2327.52 --> 2332.079
around at bev's

2330.0 --> 2333.599
or something

2332.079 --> 2335.52
i don't know

2333.599 --> 2337.6800000000003
maybe like

2335.52 --> 2339.68
fight the flat earth crowd or i don't

2337.68 --> 2342.3999999999996
know man where

2339.68 --> 2344.64
there's a lot of new wannabe anti-flat

2342.4 --> 2347.28
earther online figures

2344.64 --> 2349.839
new anti-flat earther wannabe prominent

2347.28 --> 2351.119
figures that are rolling out in like the

2349.839 --> 2352.64
last year

2351.119 --> 2356.0
i don't even know their names i

2352.64 --> 2357.7599999999998
literally don't care i will never even

2356.0 --> 2359.04
mention their name

2357.76 --> 2360.6400000000003
ever

2359.04 --> 2363.2799999999997
but they're probably hanging around

2360.64 --> 2364.48
those guys now

2363.28 --> 2367.44
right

2364.48 --> 2370.4
it's a fresh new relationship where they

2367.44 --> 2372.96
are don't immediately become associated

2370.4 --> 2375.04
with their history of extreme double

2372.96 --> 2378.56
speak and straight in your face lying

2375.04 --> 2381.119
right so they can just start new again

2378.56 --> 2383.44
right because even if your peers will

2381.119 --> 2385.92
excuse you for straight out double

2383.44 --> 2388.56
speaking and lying in their subconscious

2385.92 --> 2390.16
they have heard it

2388.56 --> 2393.04
that's gonna change everything well a

2390.16 --> 2396.0789999999997
new french person out there does not

2393.04 --> 2398.64
have that issue with you

2396.079 --> 2402.0
that's why they seek those out it's just

2398.64 --> 2402.0
like a new relationship

2404.4 --> 2406.88
anyway

2408.64 --> 2411.839
what about the speed of light there

2410.079 --> 2414.5600000000004
isn't any it's never been measured it

2411.839 --> 2416.319
doesn't exist it's a concept

2414.56 --> 2418.96
speed of light as a concept it's never

2416.319 --> 2418.96
been measured

2422.64 --> 2428.319
fetal light is

2425.119 --> 2430.319
every time it comes up it's calculated

2428.319 --> 2432.8
it's a parameter

2430.319 --> 2434.96
that's assumed

2432.8 --> 2438.48
it does exist

2434.96 --> 2440.48
yes of course oh it's a brilliant case

2438.48 --> 2444.88
brilliant

2440.48 --> 2448.52
it does excuse no it doesn't

2444.88 --> 2448.52
it's never been measured

2460.079 --> 2464.079
if light were instantaneous wouldn't

2462.079 --> 2468.4
information pass through optical cables

2464.079 --> 2468.4
instantaneously yes and it does

2469.359 --> 2473.7599999999998
yeah it does

2471.28 --> 2477.0400000000004
there's just a little delay

2473.76 --> 2479.44
because light is not literally the

2477.04 --> 2483.68
substance of electronics so there's an

2479.44 --> 2485.599
electric device that has to read

2483.68 --> 2488.24
those pulses

2485.599 --> 2490.079
yeah that takes a little time

2488.24 --> 2491.4399999999996
the light is

2490.079 --> 2494.44
indeed

2491.44 --> 2494.44
instantaneous

2500.8 --> 2504.2400000000002
yeah no no it hasn't

2505.119 --> 2511.839
i don't know what the hell that was

2507.68 --> 2511.839
but a photon is not even a thing

2513.359 --> 2519.04
like a blob i don't know what that was

2516.8 --> 2521.44
and i don't know why you would even see

2519.04 --> 2522.4
that i just know that's not sufficient

2521.44 --> 2525.2000000000003
evidence

2522.4 --> 2527.44
just because you appear

2525.2 --> 2530.3999999999996
to see something doesn't mean that it's

2527.44 --> 2530.4
actually measured

2532.319 --> 2538.319
yeah

2533.68 --> 2540.64
an optical apparent transversing is not

2538.319 --> 2544.72
conclusive proof of an actual speed

2540.64 --> 2544.72
you'd actually have to measure the speed

2545.2 --> 2549.2799999999997
as in

2546.64 --> 2551.92
physically measured not just derive it

2549.28 --> 2554.7200000000003
from a super super super super super

2551.92 --> 2554.7200000000003
slow camera

2555.839 --> 2561.2799999999997
and yeah i've seen that i've seen that

2558.4 --> 2562.64
video yeah you know what it's not enough

2561.28 --> 2565.92
evidence

2562.64 --> 2569.2
it's not enough it's never been measured

2565.92 --> 2571.28
yeah it's not official yeah you can show

2569.2 --> 2573.839
a video doing something and it could

2571.28 --> 2576.6400000000003
show you some 10 wheeler electro devices

2573.839 --> 2578.96
like look at this oh see that means it's

2576.64 --> 2581.44
a speed

2578.96 --> 2584.7200000000003
[ __ ] that [ __ ] dude

2581.44 --> 2587.68
officially it doesn't exist it's not

2584.72 --> 2591.2
measured you can't measure it

2587.68 --> 2593.359
just calculate it and insert it and a

2591.2 --> 2597.04
value is inserted

2593.359 --> 2599.359
there's no actual measurement of light

2597.04 --> 2601.119
speed

2599.359 --> 2605.48
greater depends on the speed of light no

2601.119 --> 2605.48
it doesn't because radar is radar

2610.64 --> 2613.68
light is light radar is radar i don't

2612.96 --> 2615.28
know

2613.68 --> 2617.839
you know they say it's on the same

2615.28 --> 2617.8390000000004
spectrum

2617.92 --> 2623.76
i don't know about that

2620.8 --> 2626.4
what if it just isn't light anymore

2623.76 --> 2627.76
i mean light is really freaking weird on

2626.4 --> 2630.56
its own

2627.76 --> 2632.8
that just say oh look now the radar yeah

2630.56 --> 2635.52
it's on the same spectrum well what you

2632.8 --> 2638.319
mean you just thought oh it seems a

2635.52 --> 2642.16
logical progression so this radar must

2638.319 --> 2644.24
be light because it sorta connects

2642.16 --> 2645.7599999999998
within the spectrum yeah but it isn't

2644.24 --> 2647.68
though

2645.76 --> 2649.8390000000004
it isn't it doesn't actually act the

2647.68 --> 2649.839
same

2659.2 --> 2664.16
yeah steemit that's all super cute it

2661.44 --> 2666.8
doesn't matter i've seen it i literally

2664.16 --> 2670.56
had it i had the video of the supposed

2666.8 --> 2673.8390000000004
light speed particle video i had it on

2670.56 --> 2676.4
the early bird show

2673.839 --> 2679.7599999999998
so don't [ __ ] tell me like i've never

2676.4 --> 2682.319
seen that before yeah it doesn't matter

2679.76 --> 2683.76
it's not relevant it doesn't actually

2682.319 --> 2686.4
prove anything

2683.76 --> 2688.88
it just proves your hat's a visual of

2686.4 --> 2688.88
something

2689.52 --> 2692.72
you saw something

2693.839 --> 2700.64
okay goody you saw something

2697.28 --> 2704.0
well what if literally observing it

2700.64 --> 2706.64
changes its very nature

2704.0 --> 2709.28
like the double slit experiment knowing

2706.64 --> 2709.2799999999997
which path

2710.24 --> 2713.5989999999997
well

2711.28 --> 2717.44
if you're going to figure out the path

2713.599 --> 2719.04
of a simple globule of light

2717.44 --> 2721.92
being emitted

2719.04 --> 2723.839
well then maybe a similar effect happens

2721.92 --> 2726.4
and you just get to see like oh like

2723.839 --> 2728.319
that like what instead of particles that

2726.4 --> 2730.079
a globule go around

2728.319 --> 2732.56
but we'll never know

2730.079 --> 2736.48
because there is no measured speed of

2732.56 --> 2740.7999999999997
light yeah that little visual test

2736.48 --> 2743.359
did not actually yield in a measurement

2740.8 --> 2744.96
of the speed of light

2743.359 --> 2749.359
you get it yet

2744.96 --> 2752.319
there is no measurement no measurement

2749.359 --> 2754.4
no measurement of the speed of light you

2752.319 --> 2756.88
get it yet

2754.4 --> 2761.7200000000003
you can see and look at whatever the

2756.88 --> 2761.7200000000003
[ __ ] you want there is no measurement

2768.8 --> 2773.3590000000004
and how the [ __ ] do you even know that

2770.64 --> 2775.92
you weren't just freaking cgi tricked

2773.359 --> 2779.52
with that how do you know

2775.92 --> 2782.16
how do you know you weren't just tricked

2779.52 --> 2783.92
how do you know it's one [ __ ] video

2782.16 --> 2786.48
guys

2783.92 --> 2789.48
one video how do you know you're not

2786.48 --> 2789.48
tricked

2791.44 --> 2796.2400000000002
yeah don't tell me what the [ __ ]

2794.0 --> 2799.28
how what my attitude should be about

2796.24 --> 2803.04
anything nobody [ __ ] tells me what my

2799.28 --> 2805.119
attitude is in my goddamn show here

2803.04 --> 2807.52
[ __ ] off

2805.119 --> 2811.7200000000003
either contribute to the conversation or

2807.52 --> 2811.72
shut your [ __ ] mouth

2820.88 --> 2826.96
configure a laser ranger finder

2824.4 --> 2828.839
rangefinder over a known distance yeah

2826.96 --> 2831.76
yeah you know how it does that the

2828.839 --> 2833.44
triangulation not light speed

2831.76 --> 2836.2400000000002
this has been treated already on the

2833.44 --> 2840.4
flat earth debate it's an extensive item

2836.24 --> 2840.3999999999996
like a half an hour long or longer

2841.359 --> 2844.7999999999997
yeah

2843.52 --> 2848.64
laser

2844.8 --> 2851.2000000000003
measuring things inc range finders even

2848.64 --> 2852.5589999999997
speed calculators that traffic cops

2851.2 --> 2854.16
might use yeah

2852.559 --> 2859.8390000000004
they don't

2854.16 --> 2860.68
use the speed of light they use

2859.839 --> 2863.7599999999998
a

2860.68 --> 2865.2
triangulation system

2863.76 --> 2867.76
lasers that are

2865.2 --> 2869.04
slightly not parallel

2867.76 --> 2872.6400000000003
and then

2869.04 --> 2876.0
reading the distance between the hitting

2872.64 --> 2878.0789999999997
points and then even deriving how much

2876.0 --> 2880.0
they go apart

2878.079 --> 2882.559
within a moment and then you're able to

2880.0 --> 2884.48
calculate a speed not

2882.559 --> 2885.8390000000004
speed of

2884.48 --> 2890.079
light

2885.839 --> 2893.359
that's wrong that's a stupid lil urban

2890.079 --> 2896.8
myth by wannabe einsteins

2893.359 --> 2900.0789999999997
speed has no light

2896.8 --> 2902.48
i mean light has no speed foxy

2900.079 --> 2906.559
light has no speed

2902.48 --> 2906.559
okay no my title for today

2908.16 --> 2912.92
[ __ ]

2909.119 --> 2912.92
when i switch the words

2926.88 --> 2931.04
bye

2928.559 --> 2933.119
although undoubtedly speed has no light

2931.04 --> 2936.68
either

2933.119 --> 2936.6800000000003
don't try it

2942.96 --> 2948.68
yeah that's very funny gorzilla

2945.359 --> 2948.68
very funny

2956.0 --> 2961.319
hey i want this stay the [ __ ] open

2971.2 --> 2975.52
it would be easy to demonstrate oh yeah

2973.359 --> 2978.7999999999997
yeah it's super easy so don't why don't

2975.52 --> 2980.559
you go and buy one for me not dark yet

2978.8 --> 2982.7200000000003
send it to me

2980.559 --> 2985.28
over the mail so i can demonstrate

2982.72 --> 2987.68
because i am sure as hell not gonna buy

2985.28 --> 2989.28
one of those extremely expensive things

2987.68 --> 2990.319
thank you very much

2989.28 --> 2991.92
cool

2990.319 --> 2993.359
that's very cool

2991.92 --> 2996.2400000000002
go ahead

2993.359 --> 3000.96
let you read the instruction manual

2996.24 --> 3000.9599999999996
and why did you read the technical specs

3001.68 --> 3006.0
they're cheap nowadays oh really

3005.04 --> 3008.319
huh

3006.0 --> 3008.319
cool

3008.559 --> 3012.8
i had no idea

3010.4 --> 3016.0
interesting

3012.8 --> 3017.6800000000003
but i do know that it is true though

3016.0 --> 3020.4
i'm still not gonna buy one but you can

3017.68 --> 3021.44
always send me one right if it's only 25

3020.4 --> 3023.6800000000003
pounds

3021.44 --> 3026.2400000000002
then there should be absolutely no

3023.68 --> 3029.9199999999996
problem for a wealthy glober like

3026.24 --> 3032.8799999999997
yourselves to send me one

3029.92 --> 3032.88
send me one then

3033.28 --> 3035.52
right

3036.079 --> 3041.1600000000003
cheaper than a mouse yeah i'm sending

3037.599 --> 3041.1600000000003
that thing back

3043.04 --> 3047.92
because my mouse is working perfectly

3045.52 --> 3047.92
today

3048.8 --> 3054.6800000000003
and you mr sock troll can [ __ ] off

3067.76 --> 3071.599
right

3068.88 --> 3075.76
but look i don't need to physically

3071.599 --> 3075.76
demonstrate the thing working

3075.839 --> 3080.24
i had a conversation

3078.4 --> 3083.839
on the flat earth debate

3080.24 --> 3083.839
adam meekin was involved

3084.88 --> 3090.6400000000003
he explained this i didn't even know

3087.119 --> 3093.52
that about about these laser

3090.64 --> 3096.16
measure measuring devices

3093.52 --> 3098.88
i didn't even know that about it that it

3096.16 --> 3099.92
it used a triangulation systems pretty

3098.88 --> 3101.6800000000003
brilliant

3099.92 --> 3103.92
very smart

3101.68 --> 3105.68
very smart application

3103.92 --> 3108.0
i had no idea that that was it but

3105.68 --> 3110.8799999999997
apparently there's just these [ __ ]

3108.0 --> 3113.52
out there that just said no it's using

3110.88 --> 3117.28
the speed of light to measure things

3113.52 --> 3119.44
which is [ __ ] beyond imagining

3117.28 --> 3122.079
it's just not true it's technically

3119.44 --> 3127.04
untrue that's not how it works

3122.079 --> 3127.04
it's a very specific way it functions

3136.64 --> 3139.64
uh

3150.559 --> 3156.2400000000002
time of flight

3153.119 --> 3157.28
really cheap ones okay

3156.24 --> 3160.72
really

3157.28 --> 3162.96
but that doesn't make any sense though

3160.72 --> 3165.9599999999996
because light doesn't actually have a

3162.96 --> 3165.96
speed

3183.92 --> 3191.96
oh yes a wikipedia article

3188.48 --> 3191.96
that's awesome

3196.4 --> 3200.28
the doppler effect

3214.8 --> 3219.52
yeah that's a good link by the way it

3216.8 --> 3223.319
also lays down exactly that the thing

3219.52 --> 3223.319
that i was talking about

3223.52 --> 3228.2
the triangulation system cool

3241.04 --> 3245.119
if light does not travel how do you

3242.8 --> 3246.6400000000003
measure it you don't measure the speed

3245.119 --> 3250.52
of light

3246.64 --> 3250.52
you measure its arrival

3250.88 --> 3252.88
it's

3252.0 --> 3254.48
yeah

3252.88 --> 3256.319
it's manifestation

3254.48 --> 3258.2400000000002
like it's

3256.319 --> 3259.52
it's created

3258.24 --> 3261.7599999999998
and it just

3259.52 --> 3266.319
scatters spreads out

3261.76 --> 3269.5200000000004
in beams infinitely instantaneously

3266.319 --> 3273.079
and gets absorbed by yeah whatever

3269.52 --> 3273.079
absorbs it

3289.28 --> 3293.799
there's only one lazy beam

3293.839 --> 3296.799
ah

3295.839 --> 3299.599
so

3296.799 --> 3302.48
you don't know then

3299.599 --> 3305.28
oh you think you're looking at one laser

3302.48 --> 3307.839
beam but they're probably not one laser

3305.28 --> 3307.8390000000004
beam

3308.079 --> 3311.6800000000003
have you ever realized that it may be

3309.839 --> 3315.04
just not one laser beam even though it

3311.68 --> 3315.04
looks like one laser beam

3315.2 --> 3320.16
well what you expected to visually with

3317.92 --> 3323.76
your eyes be to be able to distribute

3320.16 --> 3327.44
those two beams oh yeah no

3323.76 --> 3329.44
no this is very small stuff

3327.44 --> 3331.839
so you're probably gonna be looking at

3329.44 --> 3335.7200000000003
what you think is one laser beam

3331.839 --> 3335.72
but it actually isn't

3338.48 --> 3342.4
yeah and like the distance

3342.88 --> 3348.96
the angle that it even deviates might be

3345.599 --> 3351.119
so incredibly minute that you'll just

3348.96 --> 3352.88
not be able to see

3351.119 --> 3354.7200000000003
that it even has

3352.88 --> 3359.48
an angle

3354.72 --> 3359.48
but the detector will be able

3374.88 --> 3378.96
if light travels wouldn't the source of

3376.72 --> 3384.48
light be losing like

3378.96 --> 3384.48
stop making sense about this led i mean

3384.799 --> 3389.119
this is just like oh well if the earth

3386.799 --> 3391.839
were spinning wouldn't we see coriolis

3389.119 --> 3394.319
deviation don't go there

3391.839 --> 3396.24
don't do that

3394.319 --> 3399.44
don't actually

3396.24 --> 3401.5989999999997
think like oh what if speed did have

3399.44 --> 3403.28
what if light did have a speed oh this

3401.599 --> 3407.2400000000002
and this is what happened yeah but that

3403.28 --> 3407.2400000000002
isn't happening though

3431.04 --> 3437.92
right so there's still plenty of dirt to

3434.16 --> 3440.96
be upheaval so it seems

3437.92 --> 3442.7200000000003
all the people are all so opinionated

3440.96 --> 3445.119
about the things that you've been taught

3442.72 --> 3447.4399999999996
all your life and then you

3445.119 --> 3449.6800000000003
let it sink in and now everything is the

3447.44 --> 3452.079
foundation and now you have to make up

3449.68 --> 3454.319
excuses for why it was like the way it

3452.079 --> 3455.8390000000004
what you were conditioned it to be

3454.319 --> 3457.68
when you were young the rest of your

3455.839 --> 3459.599
life

3457.68 --> 3461.7599999999998
don't listen

3459.599 --> 3464.799
don't actually realize how it was just

3461.76 --> 3464.7990000000004
completely wrong

3465.599 --> 3470.1600000000003
no just

3466.88 --> 3472.2400000000002
reiterate no it has a speed damn it

3470.16 --> 3476.5589999999997
because i had a device and it uses a

3472.24 --> 3479.5589999999997
laser and it says it has a speed damn it

3476.559 --> 3479.559
really

3492.319 --> 3496.48
i mean

3494.319 --> 3497.839
a device

3496.48 --> 3500.559
that

3497.839 --> 3502.96
has like a myth about it

3500.559 --> 3505.119
that says it does something which it

3502.96 --> 3506.96
doesn't actually do and it doesn't

3505.119 --> 3509.28
really matter as long as it actually

3506.96 --> 3510.88
performs the function it was designed to

3509.28 --> 3513.2000000000003
function for

3510.88 --> 3515.359
who could foresee such a thing i mean

3513.2 --> 3517.04
it's not like we're completely

3515.359 --> 3518.5589999999997
surrounded

3517.04 --> 3521.2
by technology

3518.559 --> 3522.7200000000003
with such [ __ ] stories that tell you

3521.2 --> 3525.68
oh this and this is what it's doing when

3522.72 --> 3529.04
it's just not doing that

3525.68 --> 3531.52
but they like to make you think it does

3529.04 --> 3533.2799999999997
right i mean if you have an object and

3531.52 --> 3535.839
it just says

3533.28 --> 3538.88
uh this light has a speed

3535.839 --> 3541.2
then it must be true because it said it

3538.88 --> 3541.2000000000003
did

3541.52 --> 3546.4
because somebody for some reason

3544.0 --> 3548.079
insisted that it did

3546.4 --> 3549.28
even though it hasn't actually been

3548.079 --> 3552.7200000000003
measured

3549.28 --> 3553.599
it officially isn't measured

3552.72 --> 3555.68
it's

3553.599 --> 3558.079
it's so convoluted

3555.68 --> 3560.64
yet the myth just keeps echoing and

3558.079 --> 3562.7200000000003
echoing and echoing

3560.64 --> 3564.8799999999997
thanks einstein thanks for all your

3562.72 --> 3568.0
[ __ ] insertions that we're still

3564.88 --> 3571.6400000000003
struggling with to this day thanks a lot

3568.0 --> 3571.64
you wizard [ __ ]

3578.319 --> 3580.5589999999997
ah

3583.119 --> 3586.6400000000003
are you saying the manufacturers are

3584.96 --> 3587.52
lying no

3586.64 --> 3588.8799999999997
but

3587.52 --> 3590.4
maybe yes

3588.88 --> 3592.0
well not the manufacturers it's more

3590.4 --> 3594.079
like the people from the instruction

3592.0 --> 3595.76
manuals the manufacturers are just

3594.079 --> 3598.96
building it

3595.76 --> 3600.48
i mean they're just there's a design

3598.96 --> 3602.079
then you have the people building the

3600.48 --> 3604.16
design then you have the people

3602.079 --> 3606.96
packaging the object and then you have

3604.16 --> 3608.319
the instruction manual writers i think

3606.96 --> 3610.16
there might have been

3608.319 --> 3612.96
a bit of an idiot

3610.16 --> 3614.8799999999997
light speed believer in some instruction

3612.96 --> 3616.7200000000003
manuals here and there

3614.88 --> 3617.839
just

3616.72 --> 3621.4399999999996
as

3617.839 --> 3622.48
like instruction manuals for your

3621.44 --> 3626.0
for your

3622.48 --> 3627.599
satellite dish i will show you a diagram

3626.0 --> 3630.559
of oh look

3627.599 --> 3633.119
this is how it works the satellite goes

3630.559 --> 3635.28
like the redish goes to the satellite

3633.119 --> 3638.079
and then the satellite beams it to

3635.28 --> 3640.88
another radio tower and that makes the

3638.079 --> 3643.119
connection yes yes of course what's in

3640.88 --> 3646.0
the instruction manual

3643.119 --> 3646.799
so it must be true that it's not

3646.0 --> 3649.28
like

3646.799 --> 3651.599
somebody could just be there to [ __ ]

3649.28 --> 3654.079
with you to reinforce

3651.599 --> 3655.44
some conditioning

3654.079 --> 3657.44
no

3655.44 --> 3660.16
and of course the people that write the

3657.44 --> 3663.28
instruction manuals are the exact same

3660.16 --> 3666.5589999999997
people as who designed the equipment

3663.28 --> 3667.6800000000003
they're the same people

3666.559 --> 3671.28
right

3667.68 --> 3673.04
oh wait no no usually not usually that's

3671.28 --> 3675.119
a completely different type of

3673.04 --> 3677.599
profession that does that

3675.119 --> 3680.599
and it's usually compartmentalized

3677.599 --> 3680.599
yeah

3685.2 --> 3688.2
uh

3703.92 --> 3706.92
hmm

3715.28 --> 3718.88
i don't know or i don't know aren't

3717.039 --> 3721.28
going if you're opposing it or not at

3718.88 --> 3723.28
this point

3721.28 --> 3725.92
i mean with these types of subjects i'm

3723.28 --> 3727.52
kind of just yelling at everybody

3725.92 --> 3729.28
because i don't even know if you

3727.52 --> 3732.48
understand what i'm talking about you

3729.28 --> 3736.3190000000004
might just have be like oh but oh wait

3732.48 --> 3738.039
arwen i was with you all the way

3736.319 --> 3741.68
i mean

3738.039 --> 3745.5200000000004
351 episodes and 52 episodes of flat

3741.68 --> 3748.3999999999996
earth talks i was with you but now

3745.52 --> 3750.72
with the light not having a speed you've

3748.4 --> 3753.52
gone too far this time i mean it could

3750.72 --> 3755.7599999999998
literally happen and not even aware of

3753.52 --> 3757.0389999999998
it and somebody might just be in chat

3755.76 --> 3758.4
like they've been following for years

3757.039 --> 3760.079
like this is

3758.4 --> 3763.039
i'm done with you now

3760.079 --> 3765.92
i mean this [ __ ] happens guys

3763.039 --> 3769.6800000000003
so if somebody's gonna ask me a question

3765.92 --> 3772.0
i'm usually gonna answer it with

3769.68 --> 3774.8799999999997
slight hostility

3772.0 --> 3778.88
unless it's just very clear that it is a

3774.88 --> 3778.88
pure clarification question

3779.599 --> 3782.599
anyway

3783.359 --> 3787.7599999999998
how does a laser measure

3785.68 --> 3790.0
know the distance between two beams of

3787.76 --> 3790.0
light

3792.799 --> 3799.44
i don't know exactly how it does that

3796.559 --> 3802.079
i think with another beam of light

3799.44 --> 3803.44
or like a very specific camera or

3802.079 --> 3805.28
something

3803.44 --> 3807.599
i don't know how they do this

3805.28 --> 3809.2000000000003
i haven't even like looked into that i

3807.599 --> 3811.039
just know that there's two beams and

3809.2 --> 3813.52
there's triangulation involved how

3811.039 --> 3817.119
exactly they read

3813.52 --> 3817.119
the triangulation i don't know

3818.799 --> 3824.0
don't go changing okay

3822.0 --> 3828.079
i probably wouldn't anyway even if i

3824.0 --> 3830.0
wanted to i tried a lot in my life

3828.079 --> 3833.2000000000003
i'm just this

3830.0 --> 3833.2
raging maniac

3833.839 --> 3836.64
that's what it is

3837.119 --> 3842.0
although i'm extremely peaceful and like

3840.64 --> 3844.8799999999997
very nice

3842.0 --> 3844.88
in the real world

3845.039 --> 3848.8390000000004
when it's really important

3855.44 --> 3862.319
yes of course nobody [ __ ] yes

3860.0 --> 3863.76
i mean if i'm angry then i must be wrong

3862.319 --> 3867.52
because

3863.76 --> 3870.88
you are only trustworthy if you talk

3867.52 --> 3871.839
really calmly with a pr voice all the

3870.88 --> 3874.6400000000003
time

3871.839 --> 3875.68
so that nobody can get triggered

3874.64 --> 3877.839
and

3875.68 --> 3879.359
that means that you actually know what

3877.839 --> 3882.24
you're talking about

3879.359 --> 3885.52
because soon if there's any kind of

3882.24 --> 3888.799
emotion that could be detected and be

3885.52 --> 3888.799
analyzed as being

3889.119 --> 3893.039
less than scrupulous perhaps from

3891.2 --> 3894.16
somebody's perspective then that means

3893.039 --> 3895.92
that they don't know what they're

3894.16 --> 3898.64
talking about

3895.92 --> 3901.76
alright so maybe i'll just do the rest

3898.64 --> 3905.2
of the show like this

3901.76 --> 3908.079
i mean it must be very exciting

3905.2 --> 3908.96
to hear an entire flat earth early bird

3908.079 --> 3911.8390000000004
show

3908.96 --> 3914.079
with arwyn talking in this voice

3911.839 --> 3917.0789999999997
isn't that exciting

3914.079 --> 3917.079
nah

3928.4 --> 3930.7200000000003
right

3931.039 --> 3935.039
bring back a rage window

3933.2 --> 3937.2799999999997
i don't have to bring him back it's just

3935.039 --> 3940.8390000000004
like i just have to unlock the cage

3937.28 --> 3940.8390000000004
every now and then

3954.0 --> 3958.4
calm arween is kind of creepy i know

3956.16 --> 3958.3999999999996
right

3963.2 --> 3970.799
i mean you know serious dark [ __ ] could

3966.319 --> 3970.799
actually happen with me using that voice

3972.079 --> 3977.4
real dark shit's not gonna happen while

3974.24 --> 3977.3999999999996
i'm ragewin

3979.2 --> 3983.68
because the energy is already guided

3982.4 --> 3986.48
it's already

3983.68 --> 3986.48
utilized

3988.319 --> 3995.079
anyway

3990.16 --> 3995.0789999999997
yeah i never talk in that voice ever

4014.64 --> 4021.319
you met a friend today okay cool

4017.839 --> 4021.319
good for you

4021.76 --> 4025.039
man time has been flying

4025.359 --> 4030.359
it's been it's been a fun show today

4037.599 --> 4040.48
i'm kind of looking forward to the

4039.039 --> 4042.88
weekend too

4040.48 --> 4044.559
i am really starting to like my weekend

4042.88 --> 4046.6400000000003
streams because

4044.559 --> 4049.6400000000003
it's like there's so much room in the

4046.64 --> 4049.64
weekend

4052.319 --> 4056.0
well in the weekdays i

4054.4 --> 4057.839
really am

4056.0 --> 4060.799
based

4057.839 --> 4062.48
based on my own decision

4060.799 --> 4065.28
to be

4062.48 --> 4066.16
encapsulated in this specific time slot

4065.28 --> 4068.1600000000003
right

4066.16 --> 4071.92
because yeah after my show the flat

4068.16 --> 4071.92
earth debate starts i am a part of that

4074.839 --> 4080.0789999999997
and yeah it just

4078.24 --> 4081.7599999999998
it's not the same like in the weekend i

4080.079 --> 4084.6400000000003
can just be like

4081.76 --> 4087.2000000000003
i'm really inspired about something

4084.64 --> 4090.0789999999997
i'm gonna keep talking and then there's

4087.2 --> 4093.839
no issues right i do like that about the

4090.079 --> 4093.8390000000004
weekend that i have that option then

4098.159 --> 4101.759
yeah hey bearplegi bear how are you

4099.92 --> 4105.1990000000005
doing

4101.759 --> 4107.12
i'm doing okay

4105.199 --> 4109.3589999999995
oh by the way i did actually have a

4107.12 --> 4111.04
coffee like three days ago

4109.359 --> 4113.6
in the evening oh wait i think i already

4111.04 --> 4115.359
shared that

4113.6 --> 4117.679
it seems like

4115.359 --> 4120.56
every now and then as long as it is like

4117.679 --> 4121.92
not a a weekly occurrence

4120.56 --> 4123.679
coffee

4121.92 --> 4126.08
may actually have a bit of an

4123.679 --> 4128.08
interesting influence

4126.08 --> 4129.359
but i will never go back to everyday

4128.08 --> 4130.96
coffee

4129.359 --> 4134.4800000000005
like i don't want to i don't think my

4130.96 --> 4134.4800000000005
stomach would be able to handle that

4137.12 --> 4144.08
right so i think i'm gonna use the big

4140.08 --> 4146.5599999999995
bear policy on fizzies with coffee

4144.08 --> 4148.719
like he sometimes takes that and then he

4146.56 --> 4151.359
gets all complaining about how he drank

4148.719 --> 4153.359
alco again how dare you owen

4151.359 --> 4155.759
oh

4153.359 --> 4158.2390000000005
i'm like that with coffee

4155.759 --> 4161.679
it's like okay i might

4158.239 --> 4164.639999999999
maybe drink a coffee sometime

4161.679 --> 4164.64
if i feel like it

4164.88 --> 4169.12
but i don't even really like it that

4166.799 --> 4169.12
much

4170.0 --> 4175.679
it's like when it doesn't have annoying

4172.96 --> 4177.199
side effects like cramping and stomach

4175.679 --> 4180.4
acid

4177.199 --> 4183.12
then it's like yeah sure okay we'll keep

4180.4 --> 4185.2789999999995
you awake a little no fine it'll keep

4183.12 --> 4188.159
you awake that's kind of cute

4185.279 --> 4190.56
as soon as the side effects says start

4188.159 --> 4193.04
setting in which is what happens when

4190.56 --> 4195.120000000001
you start drinking it every day

4193.04 --> 4197.36
or it will start happening maybe the

4195.12 --> 4199.599999999999
first decade you won't have that well

4197.36 --> 4202.0
after a while you will and that's when

4199.6 --> 4203.92
i'm like okay i'm sick of this i just

4202.0 --> 4206.719
don't like it's not worth

4203.92 --> 4209.28
being awoke if you're constantly having

4206.719 --> 4210.4
like stomach acid reflux and [ __ ] it's

4209.28 --> 4211.5199999999995
terrible

4210.4 --> 4213.5199999999995
so

4211.52 --> 4217.0
that is part of the reason why i stopped

4213.52 --> 4217.0
drinking it

4225.28 --> 4229.92
right the same thing is not

4227.84 --> 4232.56
with alcohol however oh by the way i

4229.92 --> 4233.92
said yesterday i'd stopped drinking i

4232.56 --> 4236.88
didn't

4233.92 --> 4238.08
but i did actually

4236.88 --> 4241.84
like

4238.08 --> 4245.36
carefully plan to have just proper lunch

4241.84 --> 4246.400000000001
before i started my beers

4245.36 --> 4249.599999999999
and that

4246.4 --> 4251.599999999999
seems to be doing the trick

4249.6 --> 4254.0
because yeah sometimes i just do the

4251.6 --> 4256.4800000000005
show and then afterward

4254.0 --> 4258.239
i just immediately won a beer even

4256.48 --> 4261.04
though i'm hungry and that's really a

4258.239 --> 4263.5199999999995
stupid habit now that i think of it

4261.04 --> 4265.12
i don't know how why it's been working

4263.52 --> 4267.120000000001
that long anyway

4265.12 --> 4271.88
i should just really have

4267.12 --> 4271.88
something solid to eat first

4272.159 --> 4276.879999999999
so maybe that's what's been causing the

4274.48 --> 4276.879999999999
issues

4278.32 --> 4282.4
also i think i'm not eating enough

4280.0 --> 4282.4
greens

4282.719 --> 4286.96
i've been keeping up with the

4284.08 --> 4289.84
supplements but

4286.96 --> 4292.4800000000005
that's not exactly the same

4289.84 --> 4294.0
i mean fresh greens are something else

4292.48 --> 4296.32
and the last time i had that really

4294.0 --> 4298.239
elaborate meal it's like my entire body

4296.32 --> 4300.88
just fully restored

4298.239 --> 4305.44
so i really

4300.88 --> 4307.6
i need to get off this singles diet

4305.44 --> 4309.919999999999
and actually start cooking again for

4307.6 --> 4309.92
real

4310.8 --> 4314.52
fresh ground coffee

4318.88 --> 4322.400000000001
really

4321.04 --> 4324.48
that's interesting i didn't know that

4322.4 --> 4326.5599999999995
seeking star order

4324.48 --> 4329.28
huh

4326.56 --> 4331.4400000000005
right well i'm not a huge coffee expert

4329.28 --> 4332.88
anyway

4331.44 --> 4335.599999999999
i mean there's been a coffee that i did

4332.88 --> 4337.92
do really appreciate it's a very mild

4335.6 --> 4337.92
taste

4339.28 --> 4346.239
oh right if you're gonna roast it that's

4342.56 --> 4346.2390000000005
really interesting seeing star wars

4354.719 --> 4360.4800000000005
i'll have to think about that

4357.36 --> 4362.799999999999
i guess that really fresh coffee is a

4360.48 --> 4364.799999999999
world of difference

4362.8 --> 4367.360000000001
so you say and yeah well you you've been

4364.8 --> 4370.360000000001
a professional so

4367.36 --> 4370.36
hmm

4376.88 --> 4381.6
he's right yeah paraplegic seeking star

4379.12 --> 4385.8
wars is she

4381.6 --> 4385.8
but thanks for confirming that

4395.12 --> 4400.0
i juice every day

4396.84 --> 4402.719
ah that's the that's kind of the thing

4400.0 --> 4402.719
that i wanted

4403.12 --> 4407.199
get in sick

4404.88 --> 4409.04
i want the juice i just don't have it i

4407.199 --> 4412.879999999999
don't have the money for that i don't

4409.04 --> 4415.12
have the the juicing equipment for that

4412.88 --> 4417.6
me and my ex used to have

4415.12 --> 4420.96
what was really for my ex

4417.6 --> 4423.04
because i juiced for her every morning

4420.96 --> 4424.88
she got up very early

4423.04 --> 4427.44
and then i

4424.88 --> 4429.36
i was usually still awake at night

4427.44 --> 4432.159
because i stayed up most of the night i

4429.36 --> 4434.08
was like that all the time

4432.159 --> 4435.5199999999995
internet stuff gaming

4434.08 --> 4438.64
and then in the morning she'd get up

4435.52 --> 4440.64
very early i'd be still awake make her

4438.64 --> 4441.92
juice her breakfast

4440.64 --> 4443.52
and like

4441.92 --> 4446.08
yeah

4443.52 --> 4448.0
help her wake up before she went to work

4446.08 --> 4450.32
worked great

4448.0 --> 4452.96
worked absolutely great for like two and

4450.32 --> 4452.96
a half years

4453.199 --> 4458.96
and i juiced for every day and

4456.159 --> 4461.92
like that freshly juiced

4458.96 --> 4464.719
vegetables is really magical

4461.92 --> 4467.04
and i do miss that

4464.719 --> 4469.84
i because i haven't had that in

4467.04 --> 4469.84
10 years

4470.0 --> 4476.08
although dude i am literally surviving

4472.8 --> 4477.6
on just a bunch of supplements

4476.08 --> 4480.32
and like no

4477.6 --> 4484.159000000001
fresh vegetables for

4480.32 --> 4485.36
a long time so it is doable

4484.159 --> 4487.679
it's just

4485.36 --> 4489.759999999999
it feels like it can't last forever and

4487.679 --> 4491.6
eventually it's like my body's gonna

4489.76 --> 4492.88
implode in some mysterious way or

4491.6 --> 4495.360000000001
something

4492.88 --> 4497.92
so yeah the vegetables are calling out

4495.36 --> 4500.719
to me i have to figure out like ah i

4497.92 --> 4503.679
need to make something vegetably dinner

4500.719 --> 4506.4
and just like just do it

4503.679 --> 4508.719
stop going for standard solutions just

4506.4 --> 4512.96
get vegetables just vegetables

4508.719 --> 4512.96
vegetables vegetables just do it

4514.88 --> 4519.04
it would be so much easier if i had a

4516.56 --> 4521.6
girlfriend because they usually are very

4519.04 --> 4521.6
good at that

4522.4 --> 4526.96

4583.52 --> 4589.1990000000005
through a guy who

4585.52 --> 4591.92
ordered it from alex jones back then

4589.199 --> 4593.12
so it's kind of an old product it grows

4591.92 --> 4597.36
but it

4593.12 --> 4597.36
it seems to be healthy

4597.52 --> 4600.64
i mean

4598.88 --> 4603.92
he basically

4600.64 --> 4605.6
pumped like several cans of that stuff

4603.92 --> 4609.2390000000005
in his wife

4605.6 --> 4609.2390000000005
when she was pregnant

4611.52 --> 4614.719
because it

4612.64 --> 4616.0
would help a lot

4614.719 --> 4619.199

4693.679 --> 4696.4
on this thing

4700.32 --> 4703.599999999999

4722.4 --> 4725.599999999999
recognize this

4724.0 --> 4728.08
because this was one of his first

like hold out like at least a month

4805.44 --> 4809.199
maybe even half a year i don't know

4809.28 --> 4814.0
because like even if you can't find the

4811.6 --> 4816.56
right food if you just get a little bit

4814.0 --> 4819.84
of this and just with a little water you

oh yeah did i tell you it doesn't really

4961.92 --> 4965.4400000000005
easily dissolve as well you have to

4963.6 --> 4968.08
really like

4965.44 --> 4968.08
mix it up

4968.88 --> 4971.88
ah

4976.159 --> 4979.199
it is just

4982.88 --> 4987.1990000000005
i really hope

4985.04 --> 4989.5199999999995
really really hope

4987.199 --> 4992.48
it feels a lot better

4989.52 --> 4994.88
than it smells looks and i know it

4992.48 --> 4994.879999999999
tastes

4996.0 --> 5000.92
i haven't had like some of this stuff in

5001.36 --> 5004.32
in 10 years

5012.159 --> 5015.799999999999
that just looked delicious

5027.36 --> 5030.799999999999
okay that just

5028.96 --> 5031.92
tastes like grass

5030.8 --> 5034.320000000001
it literally

5031.92 --> 5036.2390000000005
tastes like juiced grass

5034.32 --> 5041.08
well there is like this

5036.239 --> 5041.08
what is it some grass type in there so

5043.36 --> 5046.799999999999
there is wheatgrass in there

5047.36 --> 5051.44
wow that actually tastes less gross than

5049.6 --> 5052.8
i remember it

5051.44 --> 5055.799999999999
huh

5052.8 --> 5055.8
weird

5062.0 --> 5066.12
it's still gross though

5076.639 --> 5079.639
wow

5086.56 --> 5088.88
whoa

5089.28 --> 5094.239
holy [ __ ] i can literally feel that

5091.44 --> 5094.239
hitting the spot

5094.96 --> 5097.96
huh

5098.719 --> 5100.8
huh

5099.76 --> 5103.360000000001
okay

5100.8 --> 5105.92
okay that's

5103.36 --> 5105.92
interesting

5106.32 --> 5110.4
can't you just sprinkle it on your pizza

5108.239 --> 5113.199
gross

5110.4 --> 5115.199
no

5113.199 --> 5117.44
i i don't know

5115.199 --> 5117.44
yeah

5118.639 --> 5122.56
what you could do for example is just

5121.12 --> 5125.679
juice something

5122.56 --> 5127.76
and then pour some of this through it

5125.679 --> 5129.84
right

5127.76 --> 5132.0
you could do that or you you probably

5129.84 --> 5133.6
could like do this with apple juice or

5132.0 --> 5136.0
orange juice too

5133.6 --> 5140.92
it's just that

5136.0 --> 5140.92
waiting for me to transform into a hoax

5141.12 --> 5144.32
what

5142.56 --> 5146.2390000000005
i didn't know that happened because of

5144.32 --> 5149.04
drinking some

5146.239 --> 5152.638999999999
more like a popeye effect maybe

5149.04 --> 5152.639
i mean there is spinach in there

5152.88 --> 5155.84
yeah literally

5164.8 --> 5170.08
that actually feels surprisingly good

5176.4 --> 5178.638999999999
just

5180.159 --> 5183.839999999999
i hope it stays that way

5188.56 --> 5194.0
somehow everything that tastes gross is

5190.719 --> 5195.92
good for the body well not everything

5194.0 --> 5197.36
some things are just gross and they're

5195.92 --> 5198.8
not good

5197.36 --> 5201.5199999999995
but

5198.8 --> 5204.159000000001
yeah i mean that's how i originally

5201.52 --> 5208.400000000001
learned to eat vegetables because i

5204.159 --> 5208.4
thought vegetables were gross as a kid

5208.719 --> 5213.36
how expected a kid that finds vegetables

5211.6 --> 5216.400000000001
gross what

5213.36 --> 5217.839999999999
yeah i did i didn't like it then my

5216.4 --> 5221.12
parents taught me

5217.84 --> 5222.8
it's really healthy for you really

5221.12 --> 5224.5599999999995
like you're gonna need that you're gonna

5222.8 --> 5226.8
need to like that if you want to stay

5224.56 --> 5227.92
healthy that's what they told me

5226.8 --> 5230.4800000000005
and

5227.92 --> 5233.28
i took that lesson to heart so much that

5230.48 --> 5234.5599999999995
i literally just like forced myself to

5233.28 --> 5236.96
eat

5234.56 --> 5241.04
vegetables and so every time now there's

5236.96 --> 5242.159
a dinner and somebody has a salad

5241.04 --> 5244.56
right

5242.159 --> 5246.4
i eat from it like

5244.56 --> 5247.92
even though i never make it myself

5246.4 --> 5250.719
because

5247.92 --> 5250.719
i don't want it

5251.76 --> 5257.52
but i do always eat the salad now

5255.44 --> 5259.678999999999
thanks to that

5257.52 --> 5262.159000000001
but originally i didn't like it now i'm

5259.679 --> 5264.08
like i guess i've grown older and

5262.159 --> 5267.36
i like it much better

5264.08 --> 5270.48
also since i stopped eating like

5267.36 --> 5272.4
disgusting mainstream food crap

5270.48 --> 5276.48
like chips with

5272.4 --> 5278.239
all the garbage in there you know

5276.48 --> 5280.638999999999
msg and

5278.239 --> 5283.28
coloring agents and all that disgusting

5280.639 --> 5287.32
type of stuff since i dropped all of

5283.28 --> 5287.32
that in around 2006

5287.6 --> 5291.92
it was on yeah

5289.199 --> 5293.919999999999
logically i was going to go through a

5291.92 --> 5298.4800000000005
transformation including of my taste

5293.92 --> 5298.4800000000005
buds a rotatory transformation

5299.679 --> 5304.8
and now

5301.84 --> 5307.04
i just this tastes much less gross than

5304.8 --> 5310.400000000001
i remember it and like that's

5307.04 --> 5310.4
that's really surprising

5314.08 --> 5318.4
so yeah i

5315.6 --> 5320.8
this is one of my concepts

5318.4 --> 5324.96
i've been holding on universally if you

5320.8 --> 5328.08
eat gross and poisonous things

5324.96 --> 5331.36
healthy things will taste less pleasant

5328.08 --> 5334.239
to you and gross and poisonous things

5331.36 --> 5336.159
will start tasting better to you

5334.239 --> 5338.638999999999
that's how it actually that's like a

5336.159 --> 5341.5199999999995
universal formula

5338.639 --> 5343.6
if you're used to something

5341.52 --> 5346.56
something that's not good

5343.6 --> 5349.4400000000005
and you like accept that as being your

5346.56 --> 5351.84
standard then your entire taste system

5349.44 --> 5354.879999999999
in response your bodily response will

5351.84 --> 5358.08
adapt to it that level and then judge

5354.88 --> 5359.52
other things by that level

5358.08 --> 5362.84
so

5359.52 --> 5364.719
if you cut out all the gross

5362.84 --> 5365.84
like

5364.719 --> 5368.4
yeah

5365.84 --> 5370.88
chemicals and [ __ ] out of your food

5368.4 --> 5371.92
then suddenly the actual healthy things

5370.88 --> 5374.56
will

5371.92 --> 5377.76
start to taste a lot better and then

5374.56 --> 5379.92
when you even smell like when right now

5377.76 --> 5383.280000000001
if i like smell

5379.92 --> 5385.12
a lay's paprika chips right if i just

5383.28 --> 5387.84
smell one of those

5385.12 --> 5389.44
it almost makes me choke it makes me

5387.84 --> 5392.96
like

5389.44 --> 5393.919999999999
it's so gross to me now like i can't

5392.96 --> 5396.4800000000005
even

5393.92 --> 5398.4800000000005
attempt to taste that

5396.48 --> 5401.5199999999995
it's so gross because

5398.48 --> 5404.48
i've weaned off all of that

5401.52 --> 5404.4800000000005
a long time ago

5404.96 --> 5409.12
but i never knew that this would

5406.639 --> 5410.96
actually one day taste halfway good that

5409.12 --> 5413.04
is the real surprise

5410.96 --> 5415.199
i never expected that

5413.04 --> 5418.92
i may actually take another scoop oh

5415.199 --> 5418.919999999999
wait i don't have this

5441.44 --> 5444.44
okay

5456.88 --> 5461.159000000001
still add a leftover scoop

5465.84 --> 5470.719
yes giraffe that's why you should never

5468.719 --> 5475.04
do that

5470.719 --> 5475.04
never never make an exception

5475.84 --> 5479.92
never go to mcdonald's burger king or

5478.48 --> 5483.44
any

5479.92 --> 5484.639
standard non-super strict organic food

5483.44 --> 5488.159
chain

5484.639 --> 5491.1990000000005
never do it never

5488.159 --> 5492.719
i mean some diner from some person sure

5491.199 --> 5495.04
you could do that

5492.719 --> 5498.08
if they're any good at their cooking

5495.04 --> 5500.639
but standardized food change of non

5498.08 --> 5503.5199999999995
super strict organic

5500.639 --> 5507.28
never never do that

5503.52 --> 5508.4800000000005
let them all go bust

5507.28 --> 5510.0
not that's going to happen because

5508.48 --> 5512.5599999999995
they're going to have their own addicts

5510.0 --> 5514.88
for a long long time

5512.56 --> 5515.679
they should not be able to allow to grow

5514.88 --> 5518.8
and

5515.679 --> 5520.56
ex extend their parasiting

5518.8 --> 5522.96
on humanity you should not be allowed to

5520.56 --> 5522.96
do that

5530.239 --> 5533.239
agua

5545.44 --> 5550.28
i feel really gross doing this

5567.6 --> 5570.2390000000005
all right

5572.4 --> 5577.599999999999
no but serious like i really i'm feeling

5575.28 --> 5579.44
it in here and it actually feels really

5577.6 --> 5583.96
good

5579.44 --> 5583.96
and i'm really surprised about that

5591.44 --> 5595.12
oh my god oreno

5593.199 --> 5599.96
super gross and

5595.12 --> 5599.96
yeah not surprising at all

5618.0 --> 5623.52
just just don't do it i mean seriously

5620.96 --> 5625.36
if you will like hamburgers that much

5623.52 --> 5627.1990000000005
guys

5625.36 --> 5630.159
anybody out there that's like

5627.199 --> 5633.04
gonna go to my mcdonald's really so you

5630.159 --> 5635.5199999999995
really like hamburgers do you

5633.04 --> 5637.28
cool okay i have nothing against

5635.52 --> 5641.280000000001
hamburgers

5637.28 --> 5641.28
make them yourself

5641.36 --> 5646.96
make them yourself

5644.639 --> 5649.76
using an organic bun

5646.96 --> 5651.44
and an organic beef burger and organic

5649.76 --> 5655.6
vegetables

5651.44 --> 5656.719
and organic sauces and make it yourself

5655.6 --> 5659.360000000001
i mean

5656.719 --> 5661.679
holy [ __ ] dude that's actually really

5659.36 --> 5664.48
great and it's nutritious

5661.679 --> 5667.52
and you're not gonna get super grossly

5664.48 --> 5671.04
overweight with almost toxic

5667.52 --> 5672.8
garbage heaping up in your fat layers

5671.04 --> 5674.08
so don't

5672.8 --> 5676.719
do that

5674.08 --> 5678.239
don't go to the mcdonald's and the other

5676.719 --> 5679.04
food chains

5678.239 --> 5680.799999999999
just

5679.04 --> 5684.5199999999995
stay at home

5680.8 --> 5684.52
make it yourself

5692.639 --> 5696.0
but there is a huge price difference

5694.32 --> 5698.88
yeah yeah

5696.0 --> 5700.8
yeah and that price difference

5698.88 --> 5704.88
is gonna come out

5700.8 --> 5704.88
of your medical bills

5705.119 --> 5710.599999999999
that's the price difference

5707.6 --> 5710.6
yeah

5714.239 --> 5717.199
i mean

5715.199 --> 5718.879999999999
healthy organic

5717.199 --> 5720.08
self-cooked

5718.88 --> 5723.04
food

5720.08 --> 5725.76
is my real health insurance

5723.04 --> 5727.199
that's the thing that's going to save

5725.76 --> 5729.6
me

5727.199 --> 5731.678999999999
thousands potentially hundreds of

5729.6 --> 5734.0
thousands of euros

5731.679 --> 5736.88
for medical procedures that i would have

5734.0 --> 5738.96
to undergo eventually if i didn't do

5736.88 --> 5741.04
that because i poisoned myself with all

5738.96 --> 5743.119
the crap out there

5741.04 --> 5747.159
yeah

5743.119 --> 5747.159
that's how it really works

5756.96 --> 5762.96
this one is a bigger dose

5759.36 --> 5762.96
and it's a big or gross

5764.159 --> 5766.4
ah

5766.8 --> 5770.4800000000005
god no definite like if you're like a

5769.36 --> 5772.32
food lover

5770.48 --> 5774.718999999999
and you love the taste of food you

5772.32 --> 5777.84
you're not gonna like this

5774.719 --> 5779.28
this is like a hardcore survival

5777.84 --> 5781.4400000000005
[ __ ]

5779.28 --> 5783.599999999999
this is like you gotta take this or

5781.44 --> 5785.759999999999
you're gonna die

5783.6 --> 5787.76
that's this stuff this is not something

5785.76 --> 5792.159000000001
you really this is really not something

5787.76 --> 5792.159000000001
you want to eat every day absolutely not

5794.159 --> 5802.28
but it feels great though once once it

5797.6 --> 5802.280000000001
once it leaves my taste buds alone

5832.639 --> 5840.92
i think i spared myself a whole bunch of

5836.08 --> 5840.92
physical pain in the coming months

5843.199 --> 5847.199
we have free health care but we pay

5845.679 --> 5849.04
through the nose

5847.199 --> 5851.36
with taxes

5849.04 --> 5851.36
yeah

5853.36 --> 5857.199
i mean the health care system is a

5855.44 --> 5859.919999999999
parasitic system

5857.199 --> 5859.919999999999
it's a scam

5860.32 --> 5864.0
you get poisoned through the food

5862.0 --> 5869.0
industry and then the health care

5864.0 --> 5869.0
basically reaps the rest from you

5870.08 --> 5874.159
i'm not selling it very well i'm sorry

5872.0 --> 5877.6
i'm selling it with pure honesty i mean

5874.159 --> 5878.638999999999
i literally feel amazing now

5877.6 --> 5881.84
like

5878.639 --> 5884.32
these subtle little pains and [ __ ] it

5881.84 --> 5886.08
feels like

5884.32 --> 5889.04
it's all falling into place this is

5886.08 --> 5891.199
exactly what i needed it's just really

5889.04 --> 5892.639
gross

5891.199 --> 5894.799999999999
but dude

5892.639 --> 5896.719
if it's that good does it even matter

5894.8 --> 5899.6
it's really gross

5896.719 --> 5901.28
you know i'm just being honest here and

5899.6 --> 5902.639
besides i don't even know if they sell

5901.28 --> 5907.119
this anymore

5902.639 --> 5907.119
this thing i bought over 10 years ago

5907.36 --> 5910.96
i'm amazed that it's still

5909.52 --> 5916.0
good

5910.96 --> 5918.719
it's been open for 10 years guys open

5916.0 --> 5920.88
open like this i did not open this

5918.719 --> 5921.679
recently this has been open

5920.88 --> 5924.88
since

5921.679 --> 5925.76
more than 10 year 2010

5924.88 --> 5928.400000000001
or

5925.76 --> 5932.92
10 or 8 somewhere a long time ago and

5928.4 --> 5932.92
it's still good i'm really surprised

5947.199 --> 5951.5599999999995
okay you smashed it

5957.679 --> 5962.0
right so i didn't know i was going to

5959.04 --> 5964.719
have an inner food review

5962.0 --> 5967.04
better late than never

5964.719 --> 5969.36
it's still gross and i'm definitely not

5967.04 --> 5971.5199999999995
gonna drink this every day

5969.36 --> 5974.159
but it's really good to be reminded that

5971.52 --> 5975.84
i actually did have it and that it can

5974.159 --> 5979.799999999999
do such good

5975.84 --> 5979.8
because it does feel great

5992.84 --> 5997.92
hmm they have some advice on here on how

5995.84 --> 5999.6
to mix it they say basically mix it in

5997.92 --> 6001.36
with

5999.6 --> 6003.280000000001
a bunch of fruits

6001.36 --> 6006.839999999999
and coconut milk

6003.28 --> 6009.119
powder or something and then it's good

6006.84 --> 6011.1990000000005
whatever i don't think you can make this

6009.119 --> 6013.679
taste any better

6011.199 --> 6018.08
although i bet that any animal like a

6013.679 --> 6018.08
horse or a cow would love that [ __ ]

6019.119 --> 6023.799999999999
it tastes like horse food smells

6027.119 --> 6032.08
oh thank you

6028.639 --> 6032.08
savage giraffe one

6033.36 --> 6037.04
yeah exactly for the five minutes you

6035.36 --> 6040.96
have to endure with the gross taste

6037.04 --> 6043.679
it'll make your day awesome yes

6040.96 --> 6045.679
i think so it it does feel like that is

6043.679 --> 6047.679
exactly what i needed

6045.679 --> 6048.719
i really hope it's gonna

6047.679 --> 6050.719
like

6048.719 --> 6052.2390000000005
yield more and more

6050.719 --> 6054.96
things that i'm gonna notice over the

6052.239 --> 6057.759999999999
rest of the day we'll see it dude after

6054.96 --> 6059.119
like i am going to drink beers again

6057.76 --> 6060.639
today

6059.119 --> 6062.639
when i do

6060.639 --> 6065.04
then that might kind of like counteract

6062.639 --> 6065.84
this but there's only one way to find

6065.04 --> 6068.96
out

6065.84 --> 6071.119000000001
right this is all called personal

6068.96 --> 6073.44
appearances i'm personally testing what

6071.119 --> 6075.759999999999
this is doing in my current condition

6073.44 --> 6078.159
with the build up to it

6075.76 --> 6080.320000000001
just see yeah maybe this is like the

6078.159 --> 6083.119
maybe this is like the ultimate solution

6080.32 --> 6084.88
for like my health situation

6083.119 --> 6086.639
that's been just sitting there for 10

6084.88 --> 6088.400000000001
years

6086.639 --> 6090.4800000000005
waiting for this specific moment to

6088.4 --> 6091.44
arrive it might be that good i don't

6090.48 --> 6093.919999999999
know

6091.44 --> 6095.759999999999
but i do know that it's not gonna taste

6093.92 --> 6099.04
any better

6095.76 --> 6099.04
even if i get used to it

6099.36 --> 6106.36
but yeah i mean

6101.84 --> 6106.360000000001
good taste is not everything

6108.239 --> 6115.199
anyway i'm gonna round out the show

6111.6 --> 6117.6
thanks beer in moderation yeah i know

6115.199 --> 6118.839999999999
i don't like red wine though

6117.6 --> 6122.8
so i take

6118.84 --> 6125.119000000001
like well one and a half liter of beer

6122.8 --> 6127.52
in a day that that's honestly what i

6125.119 --> 6129.679
take i don't take more because when i do

6127.52 --> 6131.92
i really notice that it's not good for

6129.679 --> 6131.92
me

6132.08 --> 6135.84
so that's what i have

6136.719 --> 6141.52
and it it it's working out fine but yeah

6139.679 --> 6143.52
on the other side i don't eat a lot of

6141.52 --> 6146.56
vegetables in general

6143.52 --> 6148.639
so then even those three beers the one

6146.56 --> 6151.04
and a half liter might actually wear on

6148.639 --> 6152.96
me slightly over time so it is kind of a

6151.04 --> 6154.4
delicate balance i'm trying to figure

6152.96 --> 6156.56
out and

6154.4 --> 6158.719
we'll see what this does anyway thanks

6156.56 --> 6160.719
