and all that is is over for now and it's

93.75 --> 101.01
sunny again and still some clouds though

97.55 --> 107.21

101.01 --> 107.21000000000001
back and yeah it's a pretty lovely day

107.75 --> 115.65
but yeah there's a lot of ruckus in the

110.82 --> 120.08999999999999
air they're going at it and I was kind

115.65 --> 122.88000000000001
of going at it myself this morning just

120.09 --> 126.0
like another like what is it that a wave

122.88 --> 130.82
of rage just hit me out of nothing just

126.0 --> 135.45
it's crazy how that works still like the

130.82 --> 138.69
duh yeah when I reach that hard it hurts

135.45 --> 141.69
so I feel still feel a bit sore from

138.69 --> 143.73
that it's it's and yeah it makes me feel

141.69 --> 148.68
very weird luckily and when I did that

143.73 --> 150.14
nobody was home I can't really explain

148.68 --> 153.299
it

150.14 --> 155.67
yeah but yeah I'm doing okay right now

153.299 --> 157.739
and yeah I'm wearing my white shirt

155.67 --> 162.20899999999997
because yeah it is a little bit warmer

157.739 --> 163.44
and it also does help calm me down when

162.209 --> 166.84
I like

163.44 --> 172.06
you can hear them right yeah the girls

166.84 --> 173.29
really upset but even like throwing

172.06 --> 180.06900000000002
stuff I think they haven't heard

173.29 --> 183.569
anything break yet but yeah apparently

180.069 --> 183.569
there is something in the air

184.17 --> 189.64
wood-pigeons oh yeah yeah there's a

187.239 --> 192.09900000000002
pigeon I don't well they come for the

189.64 --> 195.35999999999999
water also that I leave on there so

192.099 --> 195.35999999999999
there is a pigeon right there

205.75 --> 212.77
maybe it's just drag to help calm them

208.88 --> 212.76999999999998
it is kind of soo ah

216.65 --> 223.73000000000002
so anyway let's see who is in chat I we

219.56 --> 226.1
I got Tamara coffee with me and green

223.73 --> 233.12
tea gotta be careful with the Tamara

226.1 --> 241.57999999999998
coffee so Dan cause first Robin Stanley

233.12 --> 250.75
a GM man young oppa mu KU sadita cousin

241.58 --> 260.959
Tina although Neil into John Bernards

250.75 --> 263.36
eat turtle tiny one ball yeah good good

260.959 --> 269.75
to see you all sorry I'm a bit late

263.36 --> 272.69
it's just that yeah timing and all and I

269.75 --> 276.32
yeah I really needed to calm down first

272.69 --> 276.65
because that stuff hit me like a half an

276.32 --> 281.39
hour

276.65 --> 283.82
up until half an hour ago and yeah and

281.39 --> 287.45
then they just arrived like right right

283.82 --> 289.73
after that it's weird then it it almost

287.45 --> 291.8
feels like a supernatural thing like a

289.73 --> 293.87
thing in the other dimension was just

291.8 --> 296.45
hanging around it hit me because I'm

293.87 --> 298.34000000000003
sensitive then I was able to drop it and

296.45 --> 300.08
then they come in and suddenly it hits

298.34 --> 306.26
them it's very weird

300.08 --> 308.9
oh yeah I tried to call my either but it

306.26 --> 312.98
yeah it's to business so that didn't

308.9 --> 318.13
work because it does worry me a lot when

312.98 --> 318.13
like rage hits me that deeply died

319.48 --> 325.24
especially because it just seemingly

321.8 --> 328.07
comes out of nowhere it's just like

325.24 --> 331.34000000000003
frustrations towards the world just

328.07 --> 333.68
start building up and and like there

331.34 --> 334.279
seems to be the limiters off when that

333.68 --> 336.949
happens

334.279 --> 339.019
in that specific frequency it's weird to

336.949 --> 342.649
explain so it just keeps on building and

339.019 --> 348.979
building and I'm like help I don't panic

342.649 --> 351.619
though I just start yeah start getting

348.979 --> 355.669
angry like I don't want to be a victim

351.619 --> 359.65900000000005
to that feeling so the anger is like my

355.669 --> 361.849
defense against that feeling and it

359.659 --> 364.009
works much better to be angry than to

361.849 --> 365.959
start panicking because then when I

364.009 --> 369.11
panic in response that's when real

365.959 --> 372.67900000000003
depression crashes happen an energy

369.11 --> 380.36
shuts off can't allow that have to keep

372.679 --> 384.399
on going yeah and and don't like mistake

380.36 --> 392.85900000000004
this for I'm really down or something no

384.399 --> 397.039
it's not like that it's almost like I'm

392.859 --> 399.669
stronger than usual and then so leave my

397.039 --> 402.919
senses just reach out further and like

399.669 --> 405.769
yeah I'll by accident almost touch upon

402.919 --> 413.80899999999997
these things that that yeah are then

405.769 --> 415.669
unleashed upon my consciousness oh hi

413.809 --> 418.54900000000004
Tom Parker great moon video the other

415.669 --> 420.99899999999997
night you thought so yeah it was good to

418.549 --> 420.99899999999997
do it again

423.63 --> 442.21
Wow just got last the entire show damn

430.05 --> 451.21000000000004
yeah a good server yeah the moon was

442.21 --> 452.77
really bright yeah hey Jim well there's

451.21 --> 456.19
always birds around here you know

452.77 --> 458.14
there's just the small in the wood

456.19 --> 460.0
pigeon the gray ones they're really cute

458.14 --> 464.34999999999997
but there's also a flock of white

460.0 --> 466.72
pigeons like pure white pigeons and they

464.35 --> 468.67
regularly come by for the water in the

466.72 --> 475.99
afternoon and then there's the jackdaws

468.67 --> 477.73
and then there's the Magpies and of

475.99 --> 479.92
course the the crows

477.73 --> 483.1
so yeah just lots of birds around here

479.92 --> 486.19
and the small ones but they don't like

483.1 --> 496.72
stop on the roof for drinking but they

486.19 --> 500.41
do fly by all the time that bell ring in

496.72 --> 504.25
the moon it shook me oh well that's not

500.41 --> 506.74
a bell it it's actually the tripod you

504.25 --> 510.22
know of the tripod of the camera one of

506.74 --> 512.88
them one of the feet was standing like

510.22 --> 514.8100000000001
right on the edge of the balcony and

512.88 --> 520.51
then it slipped

514.81 --> 522.8199999999999
and then dang it hit the yeah it hit the

520.51 --> 525.04
balcony and that rings like a bell and

522.82 --> 527.5
of course it's very close by to the

525.04 --> 530.13
camera to the camera microphone so

527.5 --> 530.13
that's what you heard

533.7 --> 537.9300000000001
yeah good thing like at least I got a

536.19 --> 540.72
good shot before that because after that

537.93 --> 542.3399999999999
the camera just went weird I did just

540.72 --> 545.76
turn it off and then turn it on again

542.34 --> 551.0600000000001
and then it worked again but it was

545.76 --> 551.06
weird that that happened but anyway

563.97 --> 572.8190000000001
but anyway guys I hope you all had a

566.999 --> 574.589
good weekend me not so much I guess it's

572.819 --> 577.769
not like really really like bad things

574.589 --> 580.2890000000001
have happened it's just that like still

577.769 --> 584.879
since Thursday I guess I picked up on

580.289 --> 588.509
some stuff and it just it just I don't

584.879 --> 590.519
know it's like these things that have

588.509 --> 595.769
been kind of slowing down and have been

590.519 --> 598.679
in halt have started up again and like I

595.769 --> 600.839
I have an opportunity because I'm

598.679 --> 603.389
growing because I'm stronger to try and

600.839 --> 607.349
fix them before they slow down again and

603.389 --> 609.299
freeze so that I may resolve more of my

607.349 --> 613.7990000000001
personal issues that I'm dealing with

609.299 --> 616.439
just all of the time it sounds very yeah

613.799 --> 621.239
a vague description probably to some

616.439 --> 624.569
people but yeah when I dig through my

621.239 --> 628.049
storage like I did Thursday it brings up

624.569 --> 631.049
a lot of old feelings like and literally

628.049 --> 635.039
it is those yeah those things they they

631.049 --> 638.699
echo the feelings that I had from a long

635.039 --> 640.949
time ago that like I know mentally

638.699 --> 644.3389999999999
they're there but to actually face it

640.949 --> 646.799
again is it's more visceral so yeah in

644.339 --> 649.229
that way it makes me touch on more

646.799 --> 652.739
things of the past and reflect on them

649.229 --> 655.9190000000001
on the feelings more and yeah that does

652.739 --> 657.779
all kinds of things including sometimes

655.919 --> 660.049
make me extremely frustrated about

657.779 --> 660.049
myself

667.02 --> 673.11
it may be about you getting experiences

669.69 --> 674.7
of contacting the spirit well yeah well

673.11 --> 678.42
that's the typical thing isn't it

674.7 --> 683.4300000000001
every time again seriously enraged it's

678.42 --> 686.04
always always when it happens I get I I

683.43 --> 688.41
tap into memories of the dark world and

686.04 --> 691.11
yeah I tried to explain this many times

688.41 --> 696.02
before the whole experience in a very

691.11 --> 701.1
surreal way was things were shown to me

696.02 --> 703.77
in bad moments so if what it was kind of

701.1 --> 707.01
like my own memories of the future were

703.77 --> 709.74
used to torture me so it's

707.01 --> 713.64
understandable that when the memories

709.74 --> 719.58
hit me back in yeah the the pain also

713.64 --> 723.21
comes back if I hold on to it for too

719.58 --> 727.95
long and yeah that's the danger of

723.21 --> 734.6700000000001
keeping keep puzzling with it yeah the I

727.95 --> 736.62
think way back when was that on the

734.67 --> 741.93
early bird show at the earlier episodes

736.62 --> 745.5600000000001
I called that what is it staring into

741.93 --> 750.63
the dark and yeah I kind of even dated

745.56 --> 752.79
on the spot a little bit more and yeah I

750.63 --> 755.82
think that everyone need that was there

752.79 --> 760.5899999999999
could basically witness and feel like

755.82 --> 764.3100000000001
that there is something weird going on

760.59 --> 767.22
when I do that and that it changes me

764.31 --> 771.51
like there's energies unleashed on me

767.22 --> 777.48
after that and it's risky and I even try

771.51 --> 781.05
to explain it on the spot so it's the

777.48 --> 784.23
problem with me is though is that I keep

781.05 --> 789.63
on doing that because it is like this

784.23 --> 793.1700000000001
giant puzzle and still I got this

789.63 --> 797.52
sensation that I can do something with

793.17 --> 799.7099999999999
it I can also use it to fix myself more

797.52 --> 800.55
and to but it's you're mysterious

799.71 --> 807.33
because it's

800.55 --> 809.64
so ethereal when I deal with it but I

807.33 --> 812.58
imagine that over time the more that I

809.64 --> 818.459
get actually integrated society you

812.58 --> 822.63
could say the more one-sided views are

818.459 --> 825.51
dispelled because of contact with with a

822.63 --> 829.31
whole group of people so that I may size

825.51 --> 833.7
it up better instead of getting the

829.31 --> 837.7689999999999
older remote viewing superficial

833.7 --> 840.87
patterns out of it really see like how

837.769 --> 842.22
various human beings really are because

840.87 --> 846.12
it's something that I have trouble with

842.22 --> 848.7
that with with sizing that up many

846.12 --> 854.839
people you know a lot of people are just

848.7 --> 854.839
tough for me always has been Jesus

862.59 --> 867.9200000000001
Wow Wow okay

868.59 --> 881.9200000000001
yeah that's definitely a break

872.53 --> 884.41
she's anyway no yeah that's just

881.92 --> 887.7099999999999
freaking great because that that that

884.41 --> 893.53
triggers my my white knighting instincts

887.71 --> 894.9100000000001
don't like that not a good time it's

893.53 --> 895.81
just like trigger trigger trigger

894.91 --> 898.2099999999999
trigger

895.81 --> 909.88
stop stop Troy you owe me I'm trying to

898.21 --> 912.61
focus on the show anyway there's like

909.88 --> 916.59
completely going nuts here yeah I know

912.61 --> 916.59
that do not get involved yeah I know

919.38 --> 930.37
besides he's not exactly my type she's

922.42 --> 931.9
way too like too much feelings too out

930.37 --> 934.15
of control and no sense of

931.9 --> 939.75
responsibilities not a good person for

934.15 --> 939.75
me we did just yeah

942.51 --> 947.01
really yeah

955.57 --> 967.69
okay when I rage it's ya know this is

965.079 --> 970.0
really like frustration out of

967.69 --> 972.399
powerlessness type of feeling and I

970.0 --> 975.97
recognize that it's not the same my rage

972.399 --> 981.569
it is like like war it's like me being

975.97 --> 988.0500000000001
very very very insidiously pissed off it

981.569 --> 988.05
groups and relate to me in the past I

994.05 --> 999.0
don't know how well you can hear this I

996.19 --> 999.0
hope not so much

1008.67 --> 1017.1999999999999
um it's not scary neighbors they're like

1013.21 --> 1019.24
in their twenties they just and I used

1017.2 --> 1032.1100000000001
they're mostly just for frolicking

1019.24 --> 1034.24
around and get footage dank no but the

1032.11 --> 1038.4399999999998
whole relation that they have is just is

1034.24 --> 1040.63
based on just mindless fashion and [ __ ]

1038.44 --> 1042.04
and they both don't seem to keep a lot

1040.63 --> 1044.6200000000001
of borders with one another and they

1042.04 --> 1047.23
fool around don't have a lot of it's

1044.62 --> 1049.6
typical young relation and yeah it

1047.23 --> 1050.77
always ends this way because when you

1049.6 --> 1053.74
don't have a sense of responsibility

1050.77 --> 1057.6399999999999
with one another eventually it crashes

1053.74 --> 1061.36
and usually it burns so I've been there

1057.64 --> 1066.3700000000001
myself in the past not so bad as this

1061.36 --> 1067.6299999999999
though but close enough yeah I know it's

1066.37 --> 1069.7299999999998
a thin wall between because it's

1067.63 --> 1072.13
basically no wall in between it's just

1069.73 --> 1073.51
two doors and there's the sound just

1072.13 --> 1075.4
goes right through them and the same

1073.51 --> 1077.8
goes for me by the way when I get pissed

1075.4 --> 1083.2900000000002
off and they're and they're there yeah

1077.8 --> 1085.24
they get to hear it too and I tried to

1083.29 --> 1086.95
avoid that as much as possible but yeah

1085.24 --> 1088.54
when you're in situation like this and

1086.95 --> 1091.3300000000002
you're like both together still and

1088.54 --> 1092.95
fighting this is no way you could just

1091.33 --> 1095.1999999999998
like screw everybody else you know

1092.95 --> 1099.16
you're just caught up in the situation I

1095.2 --> 1102.49
get that I'm being way too sympathetic

1099.16 --> 1104.53
here this is I should be pissed off

1102.49 --> 1108.93
stupid neighbors where you make atomic

1104.53 --> 1108.93
noise but yeah

1121.94 --> 1136.03
God wants us to come to him I think

1128.15 --> 1136.0300000000002
God's God is just doing what he does I

1136.96 --> 1142.03
don't know what God wants does he want

1139.85 --> 1145.82
everyone to come to him or does he want

1142.03 --> 1151.36
everyone that succeeds in what they're

1145.82 --> 1151.36
supposed to do to come to him you know

1154.45 --> 1159.26
all right

1156.13 --> 1162.97
so it's not like he's desperate for

1159.26 --> 1165.89
everyone I think that God knows

1162.97 --> 1169.46
absolutely no sense of desperation in

1165.89 --> 1173.0900000000001
anything ever because he just

1169.46 --> 1177.6200000000001
understands and he's not burdened by the

1173.09 --> 1184.76
earthly ego darkness to counterbalance

1177.62 --> 1189.32
things so he's just full oversight full

1184.76 --> 1193.99
control and then you have no yeah no

1189.32 --> 1197.78
more impulse for panic or are like Oh

1193.99 --> 1200.27
overcompensation no anyway this I

1197.78 --> 1203.3899999999999
shouldn't do that you know trying to

1200.27 --> 1205.4
analyze the conscious experience of the

1203.39 --> 1208.0700000000002
creator himself that's ridiculous it's

1205.4 --> 1211.13
kind of folly shouldn't even do that but

1208.07 --> 1213.29
the Spirit of it I think I can approach

1211.13 --> 1217.16
what it would be like I would have - if

1213.29 --> 1221.51
I had to for example emulate the avatar

1217.16 --> 1224.66
of a deity in in the D&D game so that's

1221.51 --> 1226.82
why I dabble in experimenting trying to

1224.66 --> 1230.26
see and experience things from views

1226.82 --> 1230.26
other than just man

1231.49 --> 1234.68
[Music]

1234.84 --> 1245.82
no man is beyond forgiveness but what is

1240.299 --> 1247.799
forgiveness you know I think that I

1245.82 --> 1249.509
don't know even where I'm getting this

1247.799 --> 1255.509
right away but I think that forgiveness

1249.509 --> 1261.629
is an earthly trait because the real

1255.509 --> 1264.419
grief is done to the ones that yeah to

1261.629 --> 1267.74
which the grief has been done and that's

1264.419 --> 1272.999
where forgiveness come in so why would

1267.74 --> 1277.1
the pure lights like no forgiveness it's

1272.999 --> 1281.6000000000001
like not relevant it's just you come

1277.1 --> 1284.4289999999999
come closer to the light forgiveness

1281.6 --> 1290.279
forgiveness is like an earthly concept

1284.429 --> 1294.179
it's like no come closer and the earth

1290.279 --> 1298.309
'less the earthly people they may

1294.179 --> 1304.499
forgive or they may not forgive but God

1298.309 --> 1307.369
what is that about no it's just seeing

1304.499 --> 1310.759
you for who you are because there's no

1307.369 --> 1313.7099999999998
mistakes no preconceptions about it

1310.759 --> 1316.799
that's kind of I I just try to see it as

1313.71 --> 1320.309
pure light frequency really and that's

1316.799 --> 1323.07
just an attempt it's just an attempt

1320.309 --> 1326.639
from my part the personification attempt

1323.07 --> 1332.21
that I'm not gonna solidify in some kind

1326.639 --> 1332.2099999999998
of religion it's didn't mine experiment

1335.17 --> 1342.01
well forgiveness look an individual

1338.68 --> 1344.44
human being forgiveness towards yourself

1342.01 --> 1346.74
is incredibly important but you can't

1344.44 --> 1349.18
fake it

1346.74 --> 1351.84
you know forgiveness is not as

1349.18 --> 1355.5700000000002
straightforward as week would

1351.84 --> 1358.87
conceptualize it especially towards

1355.57 --> 1361.21
oneself in comparison to forgiving

1358.87 --> 1365.4399999999998
somebody else because forgiveness is

1361.21 --> 1367.8400000000001
like a process of the self really it's

1365.44 --> 1369.19
like when you forgive somebody else it's

1367.84 --> 1376.51
not really about them

1369.19 --> 1381.0
it's about you see but it is an earthly

1376.51 --> 1383.71
process it is it has to do with the ego

1381.0 --> 1386.5
because the ego is the one that wants

1383.71 --> 1390.52
revenge is that once the power back or

1386.5 --> 1394.75
that fears the loss of control you know

1390.52 --> 1398.1
that is hurt that yeah that makes sense

1394.75 --> 1401.2
right so forgiveness has to do is

1398.1 --> 1406.77
forgiveness is of the earthly and it is

1401.2 --> 1411.55
good it brings you closer to the light

1406.77 --> 1416.17
in the face of yeah going for revenge

1411.55 --> 1419.26
instead the French draws you further

1416.17 --> 1421.74
away from it into the darkness closer to

1419.26 --> 1421.74
Ahriman

1427.86 --> 1440.6789999999999
no it's not just the removal of

1430.84 --> 1445.9599999999998
self-guilt you you can't remove the

1440.679 --> 1447.549
guilt you can hide it and you can

1445.96 --> 1453.549
resolve it

1447.549 --> 1457.299
you can't just remove it it's there for

1453.549 --> 1461.85
a reason it has to be resolved and when

1457.299 --> 1465.97
you resolve it then you can forgive but

1461.85 --> 1469.36
yeah resolve a problem guilt problem

1465.97 --> 1474.1000000000001
with yourself is more complicated a lot

1469.36 --> 1476.559
of the times so it's you can't just drop

1474.1 --> 1480.9089999999999
it you know if my dad even in his own

1476.559 --> 1483.34
way has tried to suggest to do that with

1480.909 --> 1485.529
me because I do have like guilt feelings

1483.34 --> 1488.23
especially towards myself like I feel

1485.529 --> 1490.84
like I screwed up my own life and like

1488.23 --> 1493.33
I'm very angry at myself for being so

1490.84 --> 1495.73
helpless back then I'm literally being

1493.33 --> 1499.96
irrationally angry towards myself like

1495.73 --> 1503.74
why were you so [ __ ] pathetic why

1499.96 --> 1505.539
couldn't you just muster the that

1503.74 --> 1508.779
blooming strength why couldn't you just

1505.539 --> 1511.299
make a stand like I'm really pissed off

1508.779 --> 1513.76
at myself with that still it's not gonna

1511.299 --> 1518.279
go away like I have a lot to Oprah

1513.76 --> 1521.279
overcompensate for with that for real

1518.279 --> 1521.279
right

1525.299 --> 1535.999
I hope it's not Flat Earth math don't

1532.039 --> 1535.999
don't get in between that

1537.26 --> 1543.3799999999999
no I'm not interested in your freakin

1540.02 --> 1551.45
videos you're a clown right

1543.38 --> 1554.48
yeah QE maybe stubborn as an ox as they

1551.45 --> 1556.91
say right especially when it comes to

1554.48 --> 1559.429
this light issue it just is not willing

1556.91 --> 1561.98
to proceed to look further where I'm

1559.429 --> 1565.3090000000002
looking right and he may shave me for

1561.98 --> 1566.51
that right I'm still gonna stand right

1565.309 --> 1569.3799999999999
next to him

1566.51 --> 1573.2
arm in arm against you flat earth math

1569.38 --> 1576.5300000000002
because you're a liar and it the teacher

1573.2 --> 1581.3600000000001
no less and you're very creepy and

1576.53 --> 1586.78
manipulative so yeah don't don't try to

1581.36 --> 1589.49
use use our friendship and our problems

1586.78 --> 1592.99
against ourselves like that

1589.49 --> 1592.99
thank you very much flattered math

1597.47 --> 1600.22
yeah

1616.65 --> 1619.8300000000002
it's like

1630.93 --> 1633.93
right

1636.19 --> 1643.0900000000001
no flat earth math I've known you four

1639.19 --> 1645.67
freaking years don't don't try to

1643.09 --> 1648.1599999999999
downplay me and what I know about you

1645.67 --> 1650.29
flattered that I've seen you on camera

1648.16 --> 1652.3600000000001
I've talked to you on camera I've

1650.29 --> 1654.58
debated with you don't you remember

1652.36 --> 1656.4699999999998
right you were on the flat earth debates

1654.58 --> 1660.85
plenty of times and I was right there

1656.47 --> 1663.1200000000001
next to you paying attention I know who

1660.85 --> 1663.12
you are

1676.77 --> 1685.34
a Rekia life

1703.55 --> 1710.3899999999999
Wow Chet it's air-filled up

1715.07 --> 1721.34
now you are a liar Flat Earth math yeah

1717.95 --> 1724.52
you may not be knowingly as in the

1721.34 --> 1727.1899999999998
social way lying to other people but you

1724.52 --> 1730.4
absolutely lie to yourself and when

1727.19 --> 1734.81
confronted with it you you'd be ready to

1730.4 --> 1737.0900000000001
be executed for that lie to yourself I

1734.81 --> 1741.5
know you are because you're a very

1737.09 --> 1744.7099999999998
creepy weirdo relate to sell it but you

1741.5 --> 1746.93
are a liar and when you do it you might

1744.71 --> 1749.15
not even realize it because you're

1746.93 --> 1751.3100000000002
literally on the spot artificially

1749.15 --> 1752.69
lobotomizing yourself so you don't

1751.31 --> 1756.74
realize what you're doing

1752.69 --> 1759.29
but you are lying and every freaking

1756.74 --> 1763.67
person in the world other than you knows

1759.29 --> 1766.1599999999999
you are you can trick yourself like that

1763.67 --> 1776.78
all day long it's not gonna work we know

1766.16 --> 1780.41
you're a liar Flat Earth math the way

1776.78 --> 1786.1399999999999
you debate the way you argue you are a

1780.41 --> 1789.2900000000002
liar caught many times just play any

1786.14 --> 1791.63
kind of Flat Earth situation where

1789.29 --> 1794.11
you're involved and I'll point it out

1791.63 --> 1794.1100000000001
for you

1794.47 --> 1798.19
because it's not a rare thing

1810.68 --> 1821.43
well you see Flair's math all the

1816.57 --> 1824.82
details of your lies it's maybe mistakes

1821.43 --> 1828.0900000000001
look it's very hard to point at the

1824.82 --> 1831.8999999999999
details with that but you have been

1828.09 --> 1836.4599999999998
known to literally discuss subjects

1831.9 --> 1838.5900000000001
bring in some preconceived things that

1836.46 --> 1840.78
are very typical for ballers then you

1838.59 --> 1843.12
are kind of corrected on that and you

1840.78 --> 1845.91
even go with it like half way you know

1843.12 --> 1848.6999999999998
it's like yeah you do seem to understand

1845.91 --> 1852.0600000000002
that you go along and then the next day

1848.7 --> 1855.63
or an hour later or just at the end of

1852.06 --> 1857.79
the conversation you basically forget it

1855.63 --> 1861.45
oh and you start over again

1857.79 --> 1865.86
like it never happened you're not

1861.45 --> 1870.06
updating your your systems and yeah

1865.86 --> 1872.81
that's you know I could definitely

1870.06 --> 1875.85
consider that lying because you're

1872.81 --> 1879.02
acting you were acting like you were

1875.85 --> 1882.8999999999999
actually listening and learning and then

1879.02 --> 1887.67
you did not adapt so where you were just

1882.9 --> 1889.3500000000001
acting playing to go along pretending

1887.67 --> 1891.63
like you were listening and

1889.35 --> 1893.82
understanding and building your insights

1891.63 --> 1897.42
but you weren't well that's a lie that's

1893.82 --> 1902.58
a very complicated and very disingenuous

1897.42 --> 1905.3100000000002
lie it's like what a spy does like a

1902.58 --> 1907.77
hostile spy is just going there in

1905.31 --> 1912.6299999999999
between and just acting like their

1907.77 --> 1915.81
friends going a very long way and like

1912.63 --> 1917.97
saying things that literally you're not

1915.81 --> 1922.1299999999999
standing behind at all and just but

1917.97 --> 1924.75
acting like you are right that's lying

1922.13 --> 1930.42
is that good enough example flat earth

1924.75 --> 1935.72
math isn't that right because that

1930.42 --> 1935.72
happens a lot with you you're like that

1936.12 --> 1942.6899999999998
oh you appreciate what I'm saying oh

1939.74 --> 1946.529
there are plenty of examples well yeah

1942.69 --> 1948.48
here how about this conversation how

1946.529 --> 1950.549
about every freaking conversation you

1948.48 --> 1955.47
ever have with flat earthers how about

1950.549 --> 1959.309
those how about every single time flat

1955.47 --> 1964.23
earth math is that good enough example

1959.309 --> 1968.01
for you not building your knowledge

1964.23 --> 1971.58
going along in conversations to not be

1968.01 --> 1973.919
offensive to not trigger some flat

1971.58 --> 1977.6999999999998
earther no no it's gonna attack me again

1973.919 --> 1980.25
because I'm so poor because I'm just

1977.7 --> 1982.71
holding on to what I know to be true

1980.25 --> 1986.61
what was handed down to me by my priests

1982.71 --> 1988.6490000000001
and you'll act all the way through not

1986.61 --> 1990.9599999999998
to be offensive not to trigger anyone

1988.649 --> 1993.149
but you won't listen or you act like you

1990.96 --> 1994.679
listen and then afterward it seemed like

1993.149 --> 1997.11
you weren't listening because you aren't

1994.679 --> 2002.0
adapting no you're just retarding back

1997.11 --> 2003.9499999999998
to your original statements right yeah

2002.0 --> 2006.88
how about every single time Flat Earth

2003.95 --> 2006.88
math how about that

2007.09 --> 2012.1
is that enough examples for you

2013.83 --> 2019.8899999999999
here here see now he's gonna strawman me

2016.679 --> 2021.659
oh yeah is now is gonna create a little

2019.89 --> 2025.22
story like little psychopath

2021.659 --> 2027.39
yeah fake Christian fake Christian

2025.22 --> 2030.72
you're a fake Christian you're not a

2027.39 --> 2035.88
Christian Christians don't lie to that

2030.72 --> 2039.779
level and act like they're all nice and

2035.88 --> 2041.63
then just go back you know

2039.779 --> 2044.58
Christians are that Christians learn

2041.63 --> 2049.4900000000002
they keep growing towards the light they

2044.58 --> 2049.49
don't just act like that and step back

2065.3 --> 2070.88
yeah I didn't think that right he did he

2068.27 --> 2073.22
does this every time he's like Flat

2070.88 --> 2074.9900000000002
Earth math is an actor and I think he's

2073.22 --> 2077.06
a bit of a psychopath at it because he's

2074.99 --> 2082.7599999999998
too good at it he's too comfortable

2077.06 --> 2086.7799999999997
doing that [ __ ] yeah yeah I said it I

2082.76 --> 2089.69
said it they'll flag me buddy I said it

2086.78 --> 2091.25
that's what you are because you're a

2089.69 --> 2093.71
little bit too comfortable with this and

2091.25 --> 2097.16
you do this with everyone always this

2093.71 --> 2100.66
it's like Flat Earth math is like the

2097.16 --> 2106.2799999999997
super calm slightly less passionate but

2100.66 --> 2111.22
super calm rumpus and he'll put it down

2106.28 --> 2113.75
every time just like that but very calm

2111.22 --> 2116.72
doesn't learn anything he's just rolling

2113.75 --> 2120.83
out a program every time and now Oh

2116.72 --> 2122.75
Strahm enemies like oh wow you're you

2120.83 --> 2126.35
see now this strategy is gonna be oh I

2122.75 --> 2129.53
win why are you telling me I should be

2126.35 --> 2132.7999999999997
hostile what's wrong with me being so

2129.53 --> 2135.2900000000004
calm all of the time what you want

2132.8 --> 2138.1400000000003
people to be angry and attacked oh

2135.29 --> 2142.19
that's you are when are you sowing

2138.14 --> 2144.02
hatred Arwen Flat Earth math huh yeah

2142.19 --> 2149.4500000000003
you think we're not catching on what

2144.02 --> 2152.18
you're doing here scumbag right straw

2149.45 --> 2156.04
Manning scumbag no that's not what I

2152.18 --> 2159.47
said my complaint is about how you're

2156.04 --> 2161.7799999999997
literally acting the preponderance of

2159.47 --> 2164.3599999999997
your acting not just the face of what

2161.78 --> 2167.1200000000003
you put down right here right the

2164.36 --> 2170.06
preponderance of it all the entire play

2167.12 --> 2172.5499999999997
from beginning to end and after the

2170.06 --> 2175.37
entire thing you're entering hostile

2172.55 --> 2179.15
ground acting all nice oh you're so

2175.37 --> 2182.33
reasonable right and then you even go

2179.15 --> 2186.11
halfway along with arguments and then

2182.33 --> 2188.5099999999998
after the conversation is over you just

2186.11 --> 2189.1400000000003
drop it all down this [ __ ] I forget

2188.51 --> 2191.2700000000004
all about it

2189.14 --> 2196.239
and you didn't learn anything you didn't

2191.27 --> 2199.449
actually go along right

2196.239 --> 2201.279
and that's lying that's the thing I'm

2199.449 --> 2203.879
objecting to not you being nice yeah

2201.279 --> 2208.829
being nice is great I like being nice

2203.879 --> 2211.959
what I don't like is being nice just

2208.829 --> 2217.989
just out of a defensive strategy when

2211.959 --> 2218.589
you are literally not willing to move an

2217.989 --> 2221.169
inch

2218.589 --> 2226.389
move an inch from your religious opinion

2221.169 --> 2230.3489999999997
from your religious standpoint that's

2226.389 --> 2233.6690000000003
what I object to that your calmness and

2230.349 --> 2233.6690000000003
so reasonable

2234.119 --> 2242.9390000000003
so don't strawman me with that your

2238.509 --> 2242.939
little machinations there creep

2256.51 --> 2271.01
when you actually do do you see this

2266.84 --> 2273.3500000000004
guy's it's in that amazing he can't let

2271.01 --> 2276.59
go look I like I said at the beginning

2273.35 --> 2279.77
which seemed extremely over overkill

2276.59 --> 2283.369
right this guy is in his hat to the

2279.77 --> 2289.31
level where he would literally die for

2283.369 --> 2291.4700000000003
his religion with honor where I think

2289.31 --> 2295.5499999999997
that rhombic for example would probably

2291.47 --> 2299.9599999999996
run away wisely so you know sliders math

2295.55 --> 2304.34
is is a real deep salad like he's ready

2299.96 --> 2310.67
to reenact Christ's death for the globe

2304.34 --> 2313.94
I bet he is he wouldn't mind stepping up

2310.67 --> 2317.09
to the plate right somebody would have

2313.94 --> 2319.63
to do it he'll do it and he's so proud

2317.09 --> 2319.63
of it

2326.74 --> 2334.75
yeah you're a real martyr all right Flat

2329.68 --> 2339.3999999999996
Earth math it's not working it's only

2334.75 --> 2341.26
working in your own mind yeah I'll bet

2339.4 --> 2343.06
you're sorry for bothering me I'll bet

2341.26 --> 2345.75
you are this is not what you expected

2343.06 --> 2345.75
were you

2346.2 --> 2352.75
no I mean I don't think I'll find any of

2349.54 --> 2355.48
your videos interesting especially modus

2352.75 --> 2360.01
tollens okay because I did did get to

2355.48 --> 2363.51
see some of that and it's absurd modus

2360.01 --> 2363.51
tollens is what it is

2386.94 --> 2389.66
yeah

2406.54 --> 2409.57
[Music]

2414.46 --> 2417.46
yeah

2418.3 --> 2425.09
so since you're not actually going way

2421.58 --> 2427.36
like you said you were by right I'll

2425.09 --> 2432.92
just make you go away

2427.36 --> 2434.54
because apparently you just lied just a

2432.92 --> 2436.2400000000002
little I know what he really cares it's

2434.54 --> 2461.6
just something I needed to find out

2436.24 --> 2463.7
after everything that's been said yeah

2461.6 --> 2464.18
guns have never owned RMP I'm doing

2463.7 --> 2467.54
great

2464.18 --> 2471.04
oh well great I'm doing okay a bit of a

2467.54 --> 2473.36
crazy morning and it seems like the

2471.04 --> 2476.65
argument over there has finally settled

2473.36 --> 2476.65
but I'll be all right

2509.85 --> 2521.31
I hope you are doing a good as well yeah

2517.05 --> 2525.9900000000002
no but Guns of Navarone look he's not

2521.31 --> 2531.42
interested he's not interested in trying

2525.99 --> 2535.4399999999996
to progress the presuppositions into

2531.42 --> 2537.51
some kind of reality doesn't do that now

2535.44 --> 2539.61
he likes to just assume the

2537.51 --> 2540.84
presuppositions and move on from there

2539.61 --> 2545.07
that's what he does

2540.84 --> 2546.9
every time he likes reality to be a

2545.07 --> 2550.25
little bit more flexible so he can

2546.9 --> 2550.25
uphold as a religion

2572.74 --> 2578.3489999999997
yeah we have you guys did you see that

2575.32 --> 2582.67
the whole plum and what was it water a

2578.349 --> 2584.9500000000003
level situation well of course you did

2582.67 --> 2589.599
it's it's been playing down in the last

2584.95 --> 2593.5
week I think but I've just realized like

2589.599 --> 2597.46
how strong that is the whole water pipe

2593.5 --> 2599.71
situation and how it's supposed to line

2597.46 --> 2602.29
up and that in reality it lines up

2599.71 --> 2605.4900000000002
completely no matter the distance or

2602.29 --> 2607.839
even better over distance well in a

2605.49 --> 2610.45
presupposed globe reality it would have

2607.839 --> 2619.75
to be an even it would have to be our

2610.45 --> 2622.5099999999998
centric level and it never is so I just

2619.75 --> 2625.78
realized like wow that is a really

2622.51 --> 2630.9100000000003
strong argument the a bath brought that

2625.78 --> 2636.0400000000004
fort right but it's so strong just never

2630.91 --> 2640.74
realized how solid that that really is

2636.04 --> 2640.74
that argument pretty incredible

2642.299 --> 2648.42
that it's effective for miles and miles

2645.619 --> 2651.839
this is it's a fascinating concept that

2648.42 --> 2654.719
you could just have a giant guy and pipe

2651.839 --> 2659.369
and if you just install it perfectly

2654.719 --> 2663.7490000000003
level that yeah when you fill it up with

2659.369 --> 2668.009
liquid it's yeah it's gonna even out on

2663.749 --> 2670.6989999999996
both sides like perfectly this is just

2668.009 --> 2670.699
fascinating

2675.24 --> 2682.83
what devil was the first person I seen

2678.66 --> 2685.31
to use it you mean a water level or

2682.83 --> 2685.31
Disneyland

2703.21 --> 2706.21
pose

2718.23 --> 2724.23
and I think you rikiya life for the for

2721.74 --> 2726.1189999999997
$99 super chat donation you're getting

2724.23 --> 2728.76
very good at exposing the Wizards keep

2726.119 --> 2731.369
it up truth is near thank you very much

2728.76 --> 2735.0
for that for the compliment to I do my

2731.369 --> 2737.76
best you know the the freaky thing is

2735.0 --> 2739.88
with Flat Earth math is that I kind of

2737.76 --> 2742.1090000000004
fell for his act before and Nathan

2739.88 --> 2744.84
pointed that out to me in several

2742.109 --> 2745.94
occasions where I was like but c'mon he

2744.84 --> 2749.19
is so nice

2745.94 --> 2751.98
but then I start to see more and more of

2749.19 --> 2754.619
how he just used that position of

2751.98 --> 2762.2
niceness to be like a really nasty

2754.619 --> 2765.4500000000003
manipulator really nasty and yeah so

2762.2 --> 2768.54
it's a little personal at that because I

2765.45 --> 2770.22
kind of fell for it at first first year

2768.54 --> 2772.56
or two that I knew him I thought he

2770.22 --> 2774.33
wasn't OK guy and now what just no no

2772.56 --> 2778.77
he's not he's more like a psychopath

2774.33 --> 2781.109
than anything it's creepy like a not

2778.77 --> 2783.119
saying he is clinically or whatever it's

2781.109 --> 2790.29
just really creepy that he does it like

2783.119 --> 2792.21
that yeah and the more personal these

2790.29 --> 2796.2
types of issues with people out there

2792.21 --> 2802.02
are the more detailed I'll be able to

2796.2 --> 2806.0
put it down because I expose the people

2802.02 --> 2806.0
that I believed in the most

2809.9 --> 2814.46
you know if if I just knew they were

2812.12 --> 2818.93
trash from the beginning on I'm not

2814.46 --> 2820.91
gonna like hammer on them super super

2818.93 --> 2823.85
hard like some of these bowlers that

2820.91 --> 2829.46
have been around forever and that just

2823.85 --> 2831.29
don't progress ever you know that are

2829.46 --> 2833.6
just blatantly obvious what they are I'm

2831.29 --> 2838.0099999999998
not gonna waste my time a time on that

2833.6 --> 2840.7599999999998
unless it's really freakin funny but

2838.01 --> 2840.76
then it's not personal

2857.17 --> 2862.7400000000002
Ark on a sphere a circle is another ball

2869.75 --> 2880.25
I wait to confirm the measurement of

2872.09 --> 2888.1400000000003
water level cuz I don't think so

2880.25 --> 2890.24
oh yeah lasers maybe but I think that

2888.14 --> 2893.56
even I'm not sure about this you know

2890.24 --> 2897.8599999999997
I'm not a professional at it not like a

2893.56 --> 2901.13
builder architect or field worker but I

2897.86 --> 2904.55
think that water level is probably more

2901.13 --> 2909.17
reliable over distance than lasers are

2904.55 --> 2911.36
in general well lasers are cheaper of

2909.17 --> 2913.64
course because water level is a lot of

2911.36 --> 2916.55
work if you want to do that over a huge

2913.64 --> 2918.98
distance but I thought that the water

2916.55 --> 2921.6200000000003
level is more reliable than lasers

2918.98 --> 2924.47
because lasers no matter really how good

2921.62 --> 2926.8599999999997
they are they're gonna diffuse over

2924.47 --> 2926.8599999999997
distance

2947.37 --> 2951.66
oh yeah yeah that's right yeah I'm gonna

2950.04 --> 2954.66
round out the show thanks for pointing

2951.66 --> 2957.81
that out Amanda young and the Flat Earth
