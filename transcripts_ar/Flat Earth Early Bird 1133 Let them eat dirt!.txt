first in chat stone monkey

132.959 --> 140.959
good to see you

135.2 --> 144.23899999999998
it is saturday the 22nd of january 2022.

140.959 --> 146.879
what a set of numbers

144.239 --> 149.59900000000002
can you believe that it's episode

146.879 --> 152.239
1133

149.599 --> 156.28
on the 22nd

152.239 --> 156.28
of january 2022

156.319 --> 158.64
wow

158.959 --> 165.28
that's two threes three ones and

162.48 --> 165.28
four twos

165.519 --> 168.519
yeah

170.08 --> 172.4
right

176.16 --> 182.07999999999998
no wait it's five twos even

178.48 --> 182.07999999999998
right damn anyway

183.28 --> 187.12
ah i feel good today

189.68 --> 192.72
i had a really good slide asleep this

191.76 --> 195.84
time

192.72 --> 195.84
it was weird because

197.12 --> 204.0
yeah i'd been kind of like burdened and

201.36 --> 206.31900000000002
even yesterday

204.0 --> 208.64
the night yesterday i

206.319 --> 210.159
was not

208.64 --> 212.95899999999997
yeah not

210.159 --> 215.84
it kind of like couldn't hold together

212.959 --> 218.239
with the weird resonance thing going on

215.84 --> 220.64000000000001
well that did happen again this night

218.239 --> 223.04
but this time i noticed it and noticed

220.64 --> 225.04
how strong it was and

223.04 --> 228.48
i could even just like

225.04 --> 230.64
click it to the side it was just like

228.48 --> 232.48
it's not bothering me

230.64 --> 235.76
i could somehow

232.48 --> 239.76
relay its influence to not

235.76 --> 242.39999999999998
like charge some kind of tension field

239.76 --> 245.2
which was what led me to get sick

242.4 --> 246.239
yesterday or uh

245.2 --> 247.92
the night

246.239 --> 250.48000000000002
before

247.92 --> 251.35999999999999
one and a half days ago technically

250.48 --> 253.35999999999999
right

251.36 --> 255.84
but yesterday it managed to completely

253.36 --> 257.84000000000003
bypass that i went to bed early just

255.84 --> 260.799
like i did the day before but this time

257.84 --> 263.11999999999995
everything went great

260.799 --> 263.12
and

263.36 --> 268.47900000000004
it's like almost puzzling but one thing

266.56 --> 270.72
that did stand out

268.479 --> 271.919
because there was a big difference

270.72 --> 274.16
this time

271.919 --> 276.479
i took dirt again

274.16 --> 279.199
it's really funny because this time it

276.479 --> 281.36
was actually alex jones that reminded me

279.199 --> 284.16
of it i've talked about it in the past

281.36 --> 286.0
right remember i like to eat dirt yeah i

284.16 --> 287.91900000000004
know it sounds ridiculous right but i

286.0 --> 290.32
eat it it's really good

287.919 --> 292.479
it's ancient medicine well

290.32 --> 296.639
this stuff

292.479 --> 298.479
from adolf's just love that [ __ ]

296.639 --> 299.84000000000003
hail earth

298.479 --> 302.32
and it's just

299.84 --> 304.56
fine ground certain type of clay and

302.32 --> 306.56
it's really really good and it really

304.56 --> 308.08
did the trick so i'm gonna just do it

306.56 --> 310.96
right now

308.08 --> 312.88
because i feel so good today

310.96 --> 314.63899999999995
it's like it

312.88 --> 317.919
it hit the spot

314.639 --> 320.32
just dirt it was exactly what i needed

317.919 --> 322.56
it's really weird

320.32 --> 326.96
when you think about it

322.56 --> 329.84
but it's what it was it's just dirt just

326.96 --> 329.84
a bunch of dirt

331.919 --> 338.0
it's like don't bite on it because it

334.08 --> 341.919
actually is crisp and [ __ ]

338.0 --> 341.919
i'm gonna take it a little bit right now

342.16 --> 347.199
just for demonstration

344.639 --> 349.759
because i had forgotten about it like

347.199 --> 352.32
this thing was just standing there in

349.759 --> 355.44
the corner like as it has been for what

352.32 --> 355.44
is it now eight years

358.0 --> 362.0
and then alex jones started to talk

359.919 --> 366.56
again or was it in some advertisement

362.0 --> 368.639
but he was the one talking about it

366.56 --> 370.639
and and that popped up like

368.639 --> 372.72
two days ago

370.639 --> 376.319
and this time i thought like

372.72 --> 381.84000000000003
wait i have dirt too

376.319 --> 381.84000000000003
hail earth from adolf's best i love it

383.84 --> 387.59999999999997
because it's just dirt

388.479 --> 392.8
see

389.919 --> 395.12
now this is like normally if you

392.8 --> 397.199
like have a well or something and you

395.12 --> 399.199
bring up this kind of water you'd be

397.199 --> 401.039
like

399.199 --> 403.199
i don't know about that

401.039 --> 406.24
right because it's like as diluted as it

403.199 --> 409.039
comes right well that's logical because

406.24 --> 412.40000000000003
if you pump up that type of water

409.039 --> 414.08
it's important to know what's in there

412.4 --> 415.52
right this stuff

414.08 --> 418.71999999999997
is completely

415.52 --> 421.28
filtered and perfectly serene

418.72 --> 425.03900000000004
so it is like only dirt and not the

421.28 --> 428.0
other garbage that can be unhealthy

425.039 --> 429.84
when you have like polluted tap water

428.0 --> 431.599
something or well water

429.84 --> 432.479
right

431.599 --> 435.12
and

432.479 --> 438.0
if it just looks like that your well

435.12 --> 441.36
water but it's actually really good

438.0 --> 443.44
mineral rich area with no pollutants

441.36 --> 445.52000000000004
then drinking it like this

443.44 --> 447.44
yeah it's a little bit crispy maybe but

445.52 --> 449.68
it's actually just really healthy for

447.44 --> 451.599
you it's like extra healthy for you it's

449.68 --> 453.199
like super mineralized that's how you

451.599 --> 455.36
should see it

453.199 --> 456.88
and i'm gonna take some not that i even

455.36 --> 459.68
need it right now but just as a

456.88 --> 459.68
demonstration

459.919 --> 464.56
and who knows

462.56 --> 466.639
maybe it's a matter of the more the

464.56 --> 468.72
better

466.639 --> 470.56
it's not actually like i'm oh i'm hungry

468.72 --> 473.91900000000004
for dirt i'm just gonna chug it i'm just

470.56 --> 475.759
gonna chug like a kilogram of dirt

473.919 --> 476.84
no

475.759 --> 478.639
little

476.84 --> 481.039
bits

478.639 --> 484.24
but maybe a bit more would be better

481.039 --> 488.4
i mean i have been feeling like really

484.24 --> 490.639
sickish like and like

488.4 --> 493.67999999999995
feeble guts

490.639 --> 496.479
type of scenario for a while now and

493.68 --> 498.479
this helped me so much yesterday it was

496.479 --> 501.12
such a world of difference that maybe it

498.479 --> 504.31899999999996
is chugging time i don't know

501.12 --> 504.319
this is part of that test

505.44 --> 510.4
come on dirt

507.759 --> 510.40000000000003
get in there

513.279 --> 516.279
hmm

523.599 --> 526.159
crispy

526.72 --> 532.5600000000001
but yeah don't actually chew out down on

528.8 --> 535.8389999999999
that it's not good for your enamel

532.56 --> 535.8389999999999
try to prevent that

538.8 --> 543.04
hello ellis g good to see you

541.6 --> 544.9590000000001
jedo

543.04 --> 548.68
jeff gas head

544.959 --> 548.68
welcome to the stream

549.12 --> 554.399
right i got a whole bunch of supplies

552.8 --> 556.56
not i don't think i'm even gonna eat

554.399 --> 558.32
them but i could

556.56 --> 560.2399999999999
because maybe i'm gonna have a long show

558.32 --> 562.48
today there's not gonna be a ball

560.24 --> 564.48
busters

562.48 --> 566.48
and i got all this energy so let's see

564.48 --> 569.9200000000001
how long this goes right

566.48 --> 569.9200000000001
so i got an apple here too

570.08 --> 577.0400000000001
a tangerine nice and big one

573.76 --> 580.3199999999999
and i got some grapefruit juice

577.04 --> 580.3199999999999
on top of my minty

581.99 --> 586.88
[Music]

584.08 --> 590.76
hello matt the hat

586.88 --> 590.76
welcome to my show

591.44 --> 595.12
wait what does dirt do

598.8 --> 602.8389999999999
it

599.839 --> 602.839
detoxifies

604.48 --> 610.72
men are alive it's it's tough it

608.48 --> 613.6
it's kind of like one of those old

610.72 --> 616.48
ancient things it just works

613.6 --> 618.8000000000001
now how would i describe how it works

616.48 --> 622.32
why i'd say oh it detoxifies it

618.8 --> 625.519
stabilizes it does all kinds of things

622.32 --> 626.8000000000001
the point is it's just dirt you eat it

625.519 --> 631.04
it works

626.8 --> 634.0
it's weird by the way animals do it too

631.04 --> 638.24
birds eat dirt all the time

634.0 --> 639.76
they know what type of dirt dirt to pick

638.24 --> 643.6800000000001
dirt has nutrients in it yes

639.76 --> 643.68
surprisingly but it does

643.76 --> 650.0
and sometimes that raw type of mineral

648.0 --> 653.04
thing

650.0 --> 655.92
it does miracles

653.04 --> 657.519
it's good for plants yeah but sometimes

655.92 --> 660.92
it's good to just

657.519 --> 660.92
take it yourself

664.079 --> 669.76
and

666.16 --> 671.68
yeah some people have that impulse

669.76 --> 674.079
it's like an impulse that comes it's

671.68 --> 676.2399999999999
like an intuition

674.079 --> 677.92
like oh you need it but if you don't

676.24 --> 680.24
know that

677.92 --> 682.56
if you don't know what you're in need of

680.24 --> 684.32
you might be dwelling around

682.56 --> 686.64
stuffing yourself with things that

684.32 --> 689.12
aren't dirt and then it doesn't really

686.64 --> 691.76
help

689.12 --> 693.04
but if you know like this is time to eat

691.76 --> 694.16
dirt

693.04 --> 697.519
then

694.16 --> 698.64
yeah you do it it works great just don't

697.519 --> 699.68
just

698.64 --> 702.8
scoop

699.68 --> 705.04
randomly out of the garden or whatever

702.8 --> 707.68
like black [ __ ] or that's not it it's

705.04 --> 709.8389999999999
not about that it's about very specific

707.68 --> 712.88
type of soil

709.839 --> 714.5600000000001
clay most it's mostly clay related that

712.88 --> 717.279
works the best and it has to be

714.56 --> 719.3599999999999
unpolluted and hey

717.279 --> 720.88
dirt is sold

719.36 --> 722.8000000000001
by

720.88 --> 724.56
adolf's just

722.8 --> 726.959
it's awesome

724.56 --> 728.2399999999999
it was just louvos

726.959 --> 732.399
pale earth

728.24 --> 735.36
so yeah and that's like an old product

732.399 --> 737.519
this stuff since when is it

735.36 --> 741.72
let me see a date i want to see when

737.519 --> 741.72
they first started doing this

744.24 --> 746.88
doesn't say

751.04 --> 756.079
i think you could probably google it but

753.36 --> 760.0
i'm sure that this is like a mid 20th

756.079 --> 762.88
century if not like 19th century product

760.0 --> 765.839
i don't know how old it is

762.88 --> 767.6
but this exists for this has existed

765.839 --> 768.9590000000001
even when i was a little kid because i

767.6 --> 770.8000000000001
remember that

768.959 --> 773.3599999999999
that's why i was like bumping into it

770.8 --> 776.24
and like haha that's so funny i remember

773.36 --> 776.24
that from my youth

777.68 --> 782.0
yeah

779.44 --> 782.0
it works

782.56 --> 787.8
it's like vegetarian but cutting out the

784.48 --> 787.8000000000001
middle man

788.959 --> 793.04
right

790.959 --> 795.3599999999999
isn't that funny

793.04 --> 798.48
i wonder though i don't think that just

795.36 --> 800.32
eating dirt would like solve

798.48 --> 801.9200000000001
the

800.32 --> 804.72
like the

801.92 --> 807.279
is it the spiritual issue like how some

804.72 --> 809.6
vegans like oh we can't eat animals of

807.279 --> 813.36
anything of animals because it hurts

809.6 --> 815.2
them it's like uh yeah yeah plants yeah

813.36 --> 818.24
plants have feelings too they're alive

815.2 --> 821.76
too yeah you're still eating them

818.24 --> 825.04
well maybe they have to cut out plants

821.76 --> 827.12
as well and just eat dirt then

825.04 --> 829.519
maybe eating dirt

827.12 --> 831.12
is like the next best step to a

829.519 --> 833.44
breatharianism

831.12 --> 837.279
to a bertharian

833.44 --> 837.2790000000001
that if you just eat dirt

837.44 --> 841.12
and drink a bit of water

839.6 --> 843.12
you can survive

841.12 --> 844.48
i don't know i've never even thought

843.12 --> 846.16
about that

844.48 --> 848.88
but it's an interesting

846.16 --> 848.88
conception

850.639 --> 855.6
you should think about pathetic yeah

852.56 --> 857.92
well i'm not eating animal feces thanks

855.6 --> 860.0790000000001
professor phil bell

857.92 --> 862.3199999999999
yeah that's part of the point right

860.079 --> 865.519
needs to be clean this is not

862.32 --> 866.88
some animal pooping

865.519 --> 869.199
in a bucket

866.88 --> 871.4399999999999
and then drying that up and then they

869.199 --> 872.8
said no this is not poop this is dirt

871.44 --> 874.72
not [ __ ]

872.8 --> 877.5999999999999
professor phil bell i don't know where

874.72 --> 877.6
your mind is at

878.88 --> 884.88
but yeah this is like clay clay is not

882.16 --> 887.279
poop

884.88 --> 889.279
that's not how that works

887.279 --> 892.079
right

889.279 --> 893.519
nature completely assimilates all types

892.079 --> 895.92
of poop

893.519 --> 897.68
it completely assimilates it and

895.92 --> 900.36
transforms it

897.68 --> 904.2399999999999
and then yeah

900.36 --> 904.24
re-utilizes whatever is there

908.32 --> 911.44
yeah i don't want to think about it

909.92 --> 913.68
anyway

911.44 --> 915.839
it's a typical baller has to think of

913.68 --> 918.56
eating [ __ ] when i'm talking about

915.839 --> 918.5600000000001
eating dirt

922.16 --> 928.16
it's maybe a freudian slip of the mind

925.68 --> 928.16
i'd say

930.079 --> 935.7589999999999
it's not even a freudian slip of the

931.839 --> 935.759
tongue it's a freudian slip of the mind

936.079 --> 939.4799999999999
yeah worms

942.079 --> 946.7199999999999
well worms

944.079 --> 947.92
earthworms don't eat [ __ ] either

946.72 --> 951.0400000000001
they eat

947.92 --> 953.68
dead plant remnants that's what they eat

951.04 --> 954.88
they eat dead leaves

953.68 --> 958.7199999999999
right

954.88 --> 961.519
they leave the plants to eat the crap

958.72 --> 963.519
the animal crap and all that

961.519 --> 964.399
and the fungi they leave it to that

963.519 --> 967.51
right

964.399 --> 969.44
worms don't eat [ __ ]

967.51 --> 972.16
[Music]

969.44 --> 975.0400000000001
i mean they might crawl in between it

972.16 --> 978.0
but they don't eat that

975.04 --> 978.0
pretty sure they don't

979.04 --> 982.48
i mean only

980.72 --> 984.9590000000001
were like worms

982.48 --> 987.279
maggots from flies

984.959 --> 989.5189999999999
do that sort of thing

987.279 --> 989.519
think

991.839 --> 994.839
right

996.72 --> 1001.44
yeah build the nice designs and i am

999.199 --> 1004.24
glad you guy you got it yeah it's a

1001.44 --> 1008.36
freudian slip of the mind

1004.24 --> 1008.36
because they're so used to that

1008.46 --> 1011.5590000000001
[Music]

1012.72 --> 1016.0
right so yeah i wanted to start out with

1015.12 --> 1018.9590000000001
that

1016.0 --> 1020.72
also i was just before this watching

1018.959 --> 1022.8389999999999
just a

1020.72 --> 1026.4
amazing

1022.839 --> 1029.1200000000001
amazing video

1026.4 --> 1030.959
from howdy machowski interviewing a guy

1029.12 --> 1033.12
called bart marshall

1030.959 --> 1035.039
that he has been following for a long

1033.12 --> 1037.6
time and it was

1035.039 --> 1039.28
on freevoice.io which is like matt

1037.6 --> 1042.8799999999999
quantum of consciousness channels i was

1039.28 --> 1046.0
like what what what you know him what

1042.88 --> 1047.919
you're on his channel now okay cool

1046.0 --> 1050.559
weird cool

1047.919 --> 1052.88
and it was like really exhilarating they

1050.559 --> 1054.48
were talking about

1052.88 --> 1056.0
uh

1054.48 --> 1060.48
what's his name again

1056.0 --> 1063.919
castanada carlos castanada

1060.48 --> 1065.679
which i know is like a highly charged

1063.919 --> 1069.3600000000001
important book

1065.679 --> 1072.64
that now in retrospect i really regret

1069.36 --> 1074.9599999999998
for basically cowarding out in facing it

1072.64 --> 1077.76
and actually reading it i should have at

1074.96 --> 1079.3600000000001
some point in my life completely read it

1077.76 --> 1082.72
and i i

1079.36 --> 1084.3999999999999
declined and i feel really like ah why

1082.72 --> 1088.32
did you do that

1084.4 --> 1088.3200000000002
because i don't have that book right now

1088.799 --> 1091.84
and

1089.6 --> 1093.52
i do kind of want to read into his work

1091.84 --> 1096.48
more and more it's becoming more

1093.52 --> 1097.9189999999999
relevant for where i'm at

1096.48 --> 1100.64
and well where

1097.919 --> 1102.3200000000002
yeah these guys are at too

1100.64 --> 1105.5200000000002
in the ascension

1102.32 --> 1107.4399999999998
and it was amazing because

1105.52 --> 1110.16
yeah in that conversation they had they

1107.44 --> 1113.2
even like reflected on things that i've

1110.16 --> 1115.8400000000001
kind of like spontaneously come up with

1113.2 --> 1118.16
like the idea of

1115.84 --> 1120.48
well i guess it's not that spontaneous

1118.16 --> 1123.52
because i guess there's even been tribes

1120.48 --> 1126.0
indian native american tribes

1123.52 --> 1128.08
that had those ideas hundreds of years

1126.0 --> 1130.88
ago

1128.08 --> 1132.8799999999999
hundreds of years ago how

1130.88 --> 1135.6000000000001
during spiritual

1132.88 --> 1139.8400000000001
reset moments

1135.6 --> 1139.84
literal reality can split up

1141.039 --> 1144.559
like

1142.0 --> 1150.36
completely

1144.559 --> 1150.36
like the simulation splits into and now

1151.2 --> 1157.8400000000001
half is gone for both halves like they

1154.88 --> 1160.64
no longer co-exist and like really don't

1157.84 --> 1162.6399999999999
coexist anymore it's not like

1160.64 --> 1165.1200000000001
oh we're just going past each other no

1162.64 --> 1167.44
they like don't exist anymore they're

1165.12 --> 1167.4399999999998
gone

1169.44 --> 1174.0
like you're become you become unable to

1174.64 --> 1181.039
find any of it even

1178.16 --> 1183.6000000000001
or remember it it's very fascinating

1181.039 --> 1186.96
anyway so yeah

1183.6 --> 1189.4399999999998
very inspiring video

1186.96 --> 1190.96
i do urge you to check it out especially

1189.44 --> 1194.48
if you're interested in well my

1190.96 --> 1197.1200000000001
spiritual journey and all that my

1194.48 --> 1200.0
esoteric explanations because there's a

1197.12 --> 1201.6789999999999
lot of concentrated information in that

1200.0 --> 1205.559
in that one video

1201.679 --> 1205.5590000000002
just over an hour

1209.84 --> 1214.48
even though i heard it was all made up

1211.84 --> 1217.48
yeah oh yeah well what else would people

1214.48 --> 1217.48
say

1220.96 --> 1223.28
right

1223.52 --> 1228.08
i think that

1224.799 --> 1228.08
carlos castanada

1228.48 --> 1234.24
was a pure as a terrorist it's like i

1231.679 --> 1236.159
haven't read his [ __ ] i know it i can

1234.24 --> 1239.039
feel it i can feel it through other

1236.159 --> 1241.919
people that have read it

1239.039 --> 1243.84
he's a pure as a terrorist and he is

1241.919 --> 1247.76
like probably

1243.84 --> 1251.12
one of the early explorers

1247.76 --> 1254.8799999999999
when concerning like

1251.12 --> 1257.84
extra dimensional spiritual activities

1254.88 --> 1261.44
and spirit mechanics he was probably one

1257.84 --> 1263.4399999999998
of the first spirit mechanics explorers

1261.44 --> 1265.28
that was able to translate his

1263.44 --> 1267.6000000000001
experience because that is always the

1265.28 --> 1270.32
most difficult part

1267.6 --> 1272.559
even more difficult when you're

1270.32 --> 1274.6399999999999
like the only one

1272.559 --> 1277.12
that has a grasp on what's happening

1274.64 --> 1279.44
right now we're all more lucky because

1277.12 --> 1282.9599999999998
there are so many people ascending right

1279.44 --> 1282.96
now the gates have opened

1284.0 --> 1289.52
so we have we're not that alone compared

1286.64 --> 1291.1200000000001
to people like 200 years ago or more or

1289.52 --> 1293.36
much more

1291.12 --> 1295.9189999999999
that were like really isolated because

1293.36 --> 1298.24
they did not live in an internet age

1295.919 --> 1300.3200000000002
they would not live among people that

1298.24 --> 1302.88
would just like oh explain it to me and

1300.32 --> 1304.799
that would then kind of get it because

1302.88 --> 1307.2800000000002
they're used to quickly learning and

1304.799 --> 1309.679
then getting it right that didn't exist

1307.28 --> 1312.0
back then not like that

1309.679 --> 1314.88
it was all much more locked

1312.0 --> 1316.799
everything had their own locked

1314.88 --> 1319.6000000000001
spiritual

1316.799 --> 1323.039
tools

1319.6 --> 1325.36
people weren't like as communicative

1323.039 --> 1327.6
so it's really difficult to then

1325.36 --> 1328.9599999999998
actually lay down

1327.6 --> 1331.039
a good

1328.96 --> 1333.76
esoteric description of the spirit

1331.039 --> 1336.559
mechanics in a way that would actually

1333.76 --> 1339.28
last the test of time

1336.559 --> 1344.12
longer ago it is the more difficult

1339.28 --> 1344.12
it is to actually manifest that

1346.799 --> 1349.9189999999999
right so yeah

1348.32 --> 1352.24
pretty inspired

1349.919 --> 1353.2
also i'd like to like you guys to check

1352.24 --> 1357.36
out

1353.2 --> 1359.919
adam what adam meekin brewed up for me

1357.36 --> 1360.799
thumbnail for yesterday's early bird

1359.919 --> 1363.6000000000001
show

1360.799 --> 1363.6
really epic

1367.28 --> 1371.48
if you hadn't checked that out

1376.64 --> 1386.039
let's see i might just show you

1381.039 --> 1386.039
you can see it on a bigger screen

1390.4 --> 1393.2
what no

1394.48 --> 1397.48
hmm

1404.08 --> 1408.1589999999999
right

1405.6 --> 1408.1589999999999
check it out

1412.88 --> 1416.48
it was not what i had expected but it's

1415.679 --> 1418.0
like

1416.48 --> 1420.72
better

1418.0 --> 1422.08
so adam is like in another creative flow

1420.72 --> 1425.039
again

1422.08 --> 1427.4399999999998
which is just really epic

1425.039 --> 1429.279
so looking forward to maybe more of

1427.44 --> 1431.679
these

1429.279 --> 1434.0
i am certainly getting more inspired

1431.679 --> 1434.0
again

1441.279 --> 1447.2
so thank you adam meekin for your

1444.4 --> 1447.2
creativity

1450.72 --> 1453.52
pretty cool huh

1456.96 --> 1461.6000000000001
what do i think of deep chick sure no

1461.679 --> 1464.799
i don't think about him

1469.12 --> 1472.12
wow

1475.2 --> 1481.3600000000001
of course a baller would suggest

1477.72 --> 1484.4
irradiation with gamma rays

1481.36 --> 1487.36
as a safe solution

1484.4 --> 1490.3600000000001
i mean the esoterics of that are off the

1487.36 --> 1490.36
charts

1502.08 --> 1506.6399999999999
but yeah what do i think of that guy

1504.559 --> 1508.559
not much

1506.64 --> 1510.7990000000002
to be fair i think

1508.559 --> 1514.799
he's very creepy

1510.799 --> 1516.1589999999999
i think he's a globalist i think he's

1514.799 --> 1517.279
corrupted

1516.159 --> 1519.5200000000002
smart

1517.279 --> 1521.52
but corrupted

1519.52 --> 1524.0
and

1521.52 --> 1527.039
i'd like to think of him as neutral and

1524.0 --> 1528.72
then stay out of the way because i do

1527.039 --> 1532.1589999999999
not trust

1528.72 --> 1532.159
anything that comes out of him

1535.039 --> 1539.96
like

1536.96 --> 1539.96
yeah

1549.76 --> 1556.279
hello dx by the way adam price

1552.799 --> 1556.279
the other andrew

1568.4 --> 1571.4
uh

1572.64 --> 1579.3600000000001
yeah so my recommendation for this time

1575.2 --> 1581.8400000000001
period for myself is eating dirt

1579.36 --> 1586.4799999999998
it's from adolf's best

1581.84 --> 1589.039
right adolf knows best hail earth

1586.48 --> 1589.039
i love it

1594.4 --> 1599.52
i think it's a good time to take that

1596.159 --> 1601.679
it's been helping me a lot

1599.52 --> 1604.32
i've taken it before and it's like a

1601.679 --> 1607.039
periodic thing it's like a time in the

1604.32 --> 1609.4399999999998
year maybe this is that typical time in

1607.039 --> 1609.44
the year

1611.12 --> 1614.559
because i have not touched it

1613.44 --> 1615.44
well

1614.559 --> 1618.24
for

1615.44 --> 1618.24
at least a year

1619.039 --> 1623.679
and it's working great i feel great

1621.6 --> 1627.6789999999999
my guts are feeling great

1623.679 --> 1630.5590000000002
my tension flow is much better

1627.679 --> 1633.3600000000001
my basically my mechanical spiritual

1630.559 --> 1635.12
mechanical cohesion is now better

1633.36 --> 1636.1589999999999
and i feel good

1635.12 --> 1638.799
right

1636.159 --> 1641.44
compared to yesterday when was all just

1638.799 --> 1643.9189999999999
like it was all wearing on me it was

1641.44 --> 1645.8400000000001
kind of depressing me i could still get

1643.919 --> 1646.5590000000002
something good out but it was kind of

1645.84 --> 1650.24
like

1646.559 --> 1652.559
felt burdened now that seems gone

1650.24 --> 1654.48
because i ate dirt

1652.559 --> 1656.6399999999999
from adolf's best

1654.48 --> 1659.3600000000001
hail earth

1656.64 --> 1662.3200000000002
i just i can't let that name go

1659.36 --> 1664.7199999999998
it's all so freaking

1662.32 --> 1664.72
funny

1666.0 --> 1670.96
it's funny but not funny it's serious

1668.159 --> 1673.44
but also funny and it's just

1670.96 --> 1675.2
i just love it exists

1673.44 --> 1676.24
i hope they still exist

1675.2 --> 1678.24
it should

1676.24 --> 1680.84
i mean come on they'd sell dirt what's

1678.24 --> 1685.679
wrong with that

1680.84 --> 1685.6789999999999
anyway does it list ingredients yes

1686.0 --> 1688.32
dirt

1688.559 --> 1692.399
that's the ingredient it's dirt

1693.679 --> 1698.0
let me see where it specifically said

1700.799 --> 1707.12
yeah it's less art earth so it's like

1704.64 --> 1707.1200000000001
it's a

1707.919 --> 1713.76
it's dirt from a very specific

1711.12 --> 1713.76
uh what is it

1716.399 --> 1721.1999999999998
they call that

1718.48 --> 1722.3990000000001
like where they can't find adult now

1721.2 --> 1725.3990000000001
it's

1722.399 --> 1725.399
louvos

1726.88 --> 1729.2
dude

1730.96 --> 1736.64
this stuff should still be around

1734.08 --> 1739.84
but it's from uh yeah it's just

1736.64 --> 1739.8400000000001
what they dug up

1740.0 --> 1744.88
from one place

1742.88 --> 1748.0
in germany i think

1744.88 --> 1750.0
and it's just very finely grounded it's

1748.0 --> 1753.84
it says here it contains several

1750.0 --> 1753.84
minerals and trace elements

1754.559 --> 1758.24
in a natural composition no chemicals

1756.96 --> 1760.88
were added

1758.24 --> 1762.48
ever at any point so

1760.88 --> 1764.0
yeah

1762.48 --> 1767.799
it's just dirt

1764.0 --> 1767.799
and you gotta eat it

1772.72 --> 1776.88
who would have thought that just eating

1774.559 --> 1780.0
dirt would make me feel so incredibly

1776.88 --> 1780.96
good a clay deposit probably of some

1780.0 --> 1784.559
kind

1780.96 --> 1784.559
but from a specific place

1793.039 --> 1796.399
i mean like if you're

1796.48 --> 1800.96
somewhere out there in the world

1798.799 --> 1802.6399999999999
you could probably and yeah you have

1800.96 --> 1804.3990000000001
some nature available and you're not

1802.64 --> 1807.2
like in the middle of a city region

1804.399 --> 1809.84
because then things get all dirty it

1807.2 --> 1811.279
does like even just from

1809.84 --> 1814.0
exhaust

1811.279 --> 1815.44
car exhaust that pollutes the ground it

1814.0 --> 1817.12
does

1815.44 --> 1819.3600000000001
right so but if you're kind of like in a

1817.12 --> 1820.799
remote area you could probably find a

1819.36 --> 1823.9189999999999
good spot

1820.799 --> 1826.559
you already notice very likely that

1823.919 --> 1829.3600000000001
there are spots in nature that are being

1826.559 --> 1831.84
used by animals

1829.36 --> 1834.8799999999999
or they kind of it's like they just dig

1831.84 --> 1837.1999999999998
a hole there they just do it

1834.88 --> 1841.2
and then they eat the dirt

1837.2 --> 1841.2
well that would be a good place to start

1843.039 --> 1848.64
native americans eat bentonite clay well

1846.32 --> 1850.6399999999999
that sounds very similar to what i'm

1848.64 --> 1854.72
eating

1850.64 --> 1854.72
i guess bentonite is another brand

1863.279 --> 1868.88
how did you eat it uh i

1866.0 --> 1871.039
no i put it in a in a glass mix it up

1868.88 --> 1873.8400000000001
with water and then just chug it i don't

1871.039 --> 1873.84
put it in a pill

1876.96 --> 1881.44
can you repeat the brand please

1882.96 --> 1886.72
it's

1884.08 --> 1890.1589999999999
louvos

1886.72 --> 1891.919
it all's best that's probably not like

1890.159 --> 1894.159
yeah well you can read it it's right

1891.919 --> 1894.159
there

1896.399 --> 1899.399
oh

1912.159 --> 1915.2
right so yeah

1915.279 --> 1921.799
snapshot that whatever

1917.919 --> 1921.7990000000002
however you do it

1927.12 --> 1931.5189999999998
yeah want healthy kids let them play and

1929.44 --> 1934.96
eat dirt that's right georgetown that

1931.519 --> 1937.36
was actually my recommendation even

1934.96 --> 1940.32
two years ago on my show on the early

1937.36 --> 1942.399
word show it's one of the first things

1940.32 --> 1944.72
like that's how i would raise my kids

1942.399 --> 1946.4799999999998
just let them out in nature in a very

1944.72 --> 1948.559
good spot

1946.48 --> 1950.64
unpolluted right if you want to be

1948.559 --> 1952.559
meticulous

1950.64 --> 1953.8400000000001
get like a ground water sample or

1952.559 --> 1957.6
something

1953.84 --> 1960.399
or or like check the local forestry

1957.6 --> 1962.9599999999998
it's like how polluted is this like i

1960.399 --> 1965.279
want a good spot where my kid can just

1962.96 --> 1969.279
like crawl in dirt and [ __ ] and stuff

1965.279 --> 1971.519
and shove it in his mouth or her mouth

1969.279 --> 1974.24
it's like a little really little kid

1971.519 --> 1976.24
what's up what's the best spot for that

1974.24 --> 1978.559
right if you want to be really careful

1976.24 --> 1980.559
you could go purely on intuition

1978.559 --> 1982.72
some people do that or you can be really

1980.559 --> 1985.76
meticulous and actually do

1982.72 --> 1987.44
some like geology type research

1985.76 --> 1988.799
checking the the pollution and the

1987.44 --> 1990.559
groundwater

1988.799 --> 1993.12
before you do something like that you

1990.559 --> 1995.6789999999999
use you pick a good spot

1993.12 --> 1997.6789999999999
to go with your kid too right

1995.679 --> 1999.2
because it will be a lot better for them

1997.679 --> 2002.64
not just because of the minerals but

1999.2 --> 2005.1200000000001
also because of the exposure to all the

2002.64 --> 2008.3990000000001
natural micro creatures

2005.12 --> 2010.559
fungi bacteria

2008.399 --> 2012.4799999999998
that are not hostile because they're not

2010.559 --> 2014.48
polluted if it's all serene it's not

2012.48 --> 2016.48
polluted it's good

2014.48 --> 2020.3990000000001
it's actually good for your kid you it

2016.48 --> 2022.799
will improve their immune system

2020.399 --> 2024.6399999999999
although i would definitely

2022.799 --> 2025.9189999999999
be careful if they have not been

2024.64 --> 2027.919
breastfed

2025.919 --> 2030.0
because then that

2027.919 --> 2032.0
might be more difficult right but in

2030.0 --> 2033.919
combination with having been properly

2032.0 --> 2036.48
breastfred

2033.919 --> 2038.0
that would work great that's like an

2036.48 --> 2039.6
ancient

2038.0 --> 2041.6
method

2039.6 --> 2044.0
to get your kid a health good

2041.6 --> 2047.84
bill of health at a very young age that

2044.0 --> 2047.84
will last their entire life

2049.2 --> 2052.2
anyway

2065.359 --> 2068.0789999999997
right

2066.159 --> 2071.52
so but yeah

2068.079 --> 2075.599
i'm not like trying to chill for

2071.52 --> 2078.079
this dirt company it's just that i am

2075.599 --> 2079.52
as i have been having it i was just

2078.079 --> 2082.8
genuinely

2079.52 --> 2086.399
like smitten like whoa i feel so much

2082.8 --> 2088.3990000000003
better that's insane almost

2086.399 --> 2090.72
right so i kind of i'm just trying to

2088.399 --> 2093.679
spread the good news like this really

2090.72 --> 2096.48
works it worked really well for me i

2093.679 --> 2097.839
hope it really works for you or too for

2096.48 --> 2100.839
you too

2097.839 --> 2103.7599999999998
or maybe it wouldn't work right now but

2100.839 --> 2105.92
yeah there's no there's no exploration

2103.76 --> 2107.0400000000004
date on that you could just have

2105.92 --> 2110.0
a

2107.04 --> 2112.32
bag of dirt sitting there in a dry place

2110.0 --> 2114.24
of course

2112.32 --> 2116.4
and just at some point you might be like

2114.24 --> 2118.64
oh what's wrong with me i have

2116.4 --> 2120.2400000000002
weird impulses well have you tried

2118.64 --> 2123.1189999999997
eating dirt

2120.24 --> 2127.359
and it might be the ultimate solution

2123.119 --> 2130.4300000000003
for just those few moments who knows

2127.359 --> 2131.5989999999997
it's not like gonna be very expensive

2130.43 --> 2133.359
[Music]

2131.599 --> 2138.04
it's just dirt

2133.359 --> 2138.04
right there's no profit in it

2145.92 --> 2150.48
so we need a massive measurement event

2151.2 --> 2156.1189999999997
worldwide simultaneous observation

2158.48 --> 2160.8
well

2161.2 --> 2166.0
i don't know if that really matters a

2163.2 --> 2168.3999999999996
lot worldwide observation i think

2166.0 --> 2171.28
worldwide observations might be very

2168.4 --> 2173.76
useful to figure out all the

2171.28 --> 2177.119
celestial phenomena

2173.76 --> 2179.2000000000003
that might be out there locally right

2177.119 --> 2181.28
it's like yeah there are different

2179.2 --> 2182.8799999999997
celestial phenomena

2181.28 --> 2185.0400000000004
it doesn't have anything really to do

2182.88 --> 2187.6800000000003
with measuring the land

2185.04 --> 2189.7599999999998
but you do need to go everywhere and

2187.68 --> 2191.5989999999997
look see like is there something out of

2189.76 --> 2194.0
the ordinary

2191.599 --> 2196.2400000000002
compared to other regions is it always

2194.0 --> 2198.56
like that or is it in a certain time of

2196.24 --> 2200.8799999999997
a year that it's always like that like

2198.56 --> 2203.52
unusual phenomena

2200.88 --> 2206.48
the celestial sort like with the sun or

2203.52 --> 2209.2
the how the moon looks or

2206.48 --> 2213.28
something similar

2209.2 --> 2216.0
unusual star-like sightings whatever

2213.28 --> 2217.92
right that's good to go out and observe

2216.0 --> 2220.72
everywhere to just map it like what's

2217.92 --> 2222.48
going on out there in in these skies

2220.72 --> 2224.64
what's going on with the celestials with

2222.48 --> 2227.359
all these holographic lights

2224.64 --> 2228.48
in relation to earth locations

2227.359 --> 2230.56
but

2228.48 --> 2232.88
that's not going to help us understand

2230.56 --> 2235.7599999999998
the layout though

2232.88 --> 2238.88
of our realm for that

2235.76 --> 2240.6400000000003
it mostly requires a big

2238.88 --> 2242.48
effort

2240.64 --> 2245.52
mostly boats

2242.48 --> 2248.72
or submarines even or combinate both

2245.52 --> 2248.72
boat and submarine

2249.28 --> 2256.92
that could like scan scan the place like

2252.64 --> 2256.92
scan the ocean bottom

2257.04 --> 2261.52
right i think that the main key to

2259.44 --> 2264.56
figuring out would be scanning the ocean

2261.52 --> 2265.7599999999998
bottom because why is that huh well

2264.56 --> 2266.72
because

2265.76 --> 2269.599
every

2266.72 --> 2270.48
part of the lens in our realm is

2269.599 --> 2272.96
connected

2270.48 --> 2274.48
by an ocean everywhere

2272.96 --> 2276.8
so

2274.48 --> 2276.8
right

2277.28 --> 2281.4
and it's

2278.96 --> 2284.079
again

2281.4 --> 2287.28
[Music]

2284.079 --> 2289.599
it's marine law it's different

2287.28 --> 2291.92
so scanning the ocean bottoms would

2289.599 --> 2293.6800000000003
definitely help to

2291.92 --> 2296.0
to map out

2293.68 --> 2299.1189999999997
what the entire orientation of the realm

2296.0 --> 2301.599
is like what is this what is this layout

2299.119 --> 2303.599
of ours what is it really

2301.599 --> 2306.56
and then yeah

2303.599 --> 2309.3590000000004
wherever the cards may fall they fall

2306.56 --> 2311.2799999999997
or the dice and might turn out that it's

2309.359 --> 2313.04
going to be very confusing because all

2311.28 --> 2314.88
these

2313.04 --> 2316.079
scanned land segments when you just

2314.88 --> 2318.56
place

2316.079 --> 2321.2000000000003
when you place them together

2318.56 --> 2325.04
might turn out just not to fit

2321.2 --> 2327.4399999999996
on a singular map like in a in euclidean

2325.04 --> 2329.92
fashion it might just be

2327.44 --> 2331.92
non-linear that might be a result would

2329.92 --> 2334.2400000000002
be very confusing

2331.92 --> 2335.92
would probably be confusing until the

2334.24 --> 2339.359
end of time there will be people that

2335.92 --> 2341.599
will simply never understand that

2339.359 --> 2343.2799999999997
if that were to be the case

2341.599 --> 2346.56
they would never get it

2343.28 --> 2348.4
no matter how many generations

2346.56 --> 2351.7599999999998
just people that would not understand

2348.4 --> 2353.76
that it could not go beyond

2351.76 --> 2356.079
assumption that everything has to be

2353.76 --> 2358.4
euclidean exact so that you could in

2356.079 --> 2361.28
your mind miniaturize the whole thing in

2358.4 --> 2363.76
a single oversight right

2361.28 --> 2366.48
it might turn out that the realm design

2363.76 --> 2367.92
just isn't like that that it's all flat

2366.48 --> 2370.16
yet it doesn't

2367.92 --> 2370.16
fit

2370.72 --> 2373.7599999999998
it doesn't really fit

2374.16 --> 2378.48
right but to get there we need to scan

2376.24 --> 2381.2
the ocean bottoms that's that would be

2378.48 --> 2383.839
the primary thing to do in order to get

2381.2 --> 2383.839
that data

2386.72 --> 2388.9599999999996
right

2389.839 --> 2397.24
but yeah can you get everywhere are we

2392.56 --> 2397.24
would we be allowed to go everywhere

2397.359 --> 2401.04
right like

2398.88 --> 2404.079
guys who knows

2401.04 --> 2405.92
we might not even realize that there has

2404.079 --> 2408.0
been like a

2405.92 --> 2410.8
oceanic

2408.0 --> 2413.28
like an oceanic atlantis-type city

2410.8 --> 2413.28
somewhere

2414.0 --> 2418.16
and that that is part of the reason why

2415.76 --> 2421.119
you just are not allowed

2418.16 --> 2423.839
to go beyond a certain

2421.119 --> 2426.079
part of the realm

2423.839 --> 2427.68
because like yeah you're not supposed to

2426.079 --> 2430.7200000000003
scan there because there's like an

2427.68 --> 2432.56
entire civilization there

2430.72 --> 2435.5989999999997
it's always been there

2432.56 --> 2438.16
and they leave us alone because it's

2435.599 --> 2440.2400000000002
we've made it off limits that's the deal

2438.16 --> 2442.24
that could turn out to be the case too

2440.24 --> 2444.3999999999996
you never really know

2442.24 --> 2446.4799999999996
what you're gonna bump into

2444.4 --> 2448.48
when you're trying to figure out that

2446.48 --> 2451.359
which you do not know

2448.48 --> 2455.8
you should be anticipating all kinds of

2451.359 --> 2455.7999999999997
things that could come out of that

2468.96 --> 2473.119
you found a mechanical gyro picking up

2471.599 --> 2476.119
drifts

2473.119 --> 2476.119
no

2480.079 --> 2482.88
there just no

2481.599 --> 2484.7200000000003
unless it's

2482.88 --> 2487.04
it has a design flaw

2484.72 --> 2490.0789999999997
and it drifts right can just be a

2487.04 --> 2492.319
mechanical flaw

2490.079 --> 2497.52
still a man-made device

2492.319 --> 2497.52
but yeah no there's no selective drift

2497.76 --> 2501.76
either it always drifts because the

2499.839 --> 2504.48
earth is turned is a ball spinning

2501.76 --> 2506.48
underneath or it never does that and

2504.48 --> 2508.4
that means that if there is some kind of

2506.48 --> 2510.64
a drift happening

2508.4 --> 2512.96
in a singular

2510.64 --> 2515.44
example that there's something wrong

2512.96 --> 2519.28
with the device

2515.44 --> 2519.28
because no device should be doing that

2520.079 --> 2525.76
and others don't

2523.599 --> 2526.7200000000003
then if one device would be

2525.76 --> 2528.2400000000002
would be

2526.72 --> 2530.0789999999997
drifting

2528.24 --> 2533.2799999999997
because the earth is supposedly turning

2530.079 --> 2536.1600000000003
in underneath then without any exception

2533.28 --> 2540.2400000000002
all other devices should be doing the

2536.16 --> 2540.24
same at all times and they don't

2540.48 --> 2546.48
right so if you spotted one video where

2543.04 --> 2547.839
it seems to drift it's either a fraud or

2546.48 --> 2550.839
there's something wrong with that

2547.839 --> 2550.839
gyroscope

2551.28 --> 2554.2400000000002
right maybe it's slightly out of balance

2552.96 --> 2556.8
or something

2554.24 --> 2556.7999999999997
i don't know

2558.16 --> 2563.2
i just know that mechanical gyroscopes

2561.04 --> 2565.7599999999998
don't drift

2563.2 --> 2568.72
they'd normally don't do that

2565.76 --> 2569.6800000000003
if they would they would not be used

2568.72 --> 2572.0
because

2569.68 --> 2574.0
that they don't drift is there like

2572.0 --> 2575.2
their ultimate

2574.0 --> 2577.119
function

2575.2 --> 2579.2
that they don't drift that they stay

2577.119 --> 2582.0
perfectly stable

2579.2 --> 2585.1189999999997
in relation to whatever is moving around

2582.0 --> 2587.28
them right that's why they are even used

2585.119 --> 2589.599
for that sole function because of the

2587.28 --> 2593.6800000000003
stabilization

2589.599 --> 2595.3590000000004
so if you have a gyroscope that drifts

2593.68 --> 2596.96
they would immediately replace it

2595.359 --> 2598.7999999999997
because it's not doing what it's

2596.96 --> 2600.64
supposed to be doing

2598.8 --> 2603.04
and then it's useless

2600.64 --> 2605.52
as a gyroscope so they get one that

2603.04 --> 2608.48
doesn't do it that's designed properly

2605.52 --> 2608.48
and that doesn't drift

2611.92 --> 2617.409
all right

2614.32 --> 2617.409
[Music]

2639.52 --> 2644.72
maybe the bottom of the ocean is pretty

2641.68 --> 2646.56
level well yes it is pretty level

2644.72 --> 2649.839
it's very level

2646.56 --> 2653.2799999999997
the largest swaths of flat

2649.839 --> 2653.2799999999997
surface is the ocean

2655.599 --> 2661.3590000000004
like that's the preponderance of the

2657.839 --> 2662.4
oceanic floor is the the biggest amount

2661.359 --> 2663.68
of flat

2662.4 --> 2667.2000000000003
surface

2663.68 --> 2669.52
in the entire realm is the ocean bottom

2667.2 --> 2671.4399999999996
that's right

2669.52 --> 2674.72
there's like entire

2671.44 --> 2676.7200000000003
oceanic bottom flat plains that are so

2674.72 --> 2679.359
incredibly vast

2676.72 --> 2683.1189999999997
my entire country would easily fit in

2679.359 --> 2683.119
them in multiple places

2686.72 --> 2692.319
yeah fast stretches of very flat ocean

2690.0 --> 2692.319
bottom

2692.4 --> 2696.319
hey guns have never owned rmp how am i

2694.319 --> 2699.88
doing today i'm doing great today i'm

2696.319 --> 2699.88
really doing good

2711.92 --> 2718.28
i feel good i watched a great video that

2714.48 --> 2718.28
inspired me greatly

2721.92 --> 2725.359
on free voice dot io

2726.079 --> 2731.079
between hardy machowski and bart

2728.079 --> 2731.079
marshall

2733.599 --> 2737.079
it was excellent

2763.28 --> 2766.28
um

2784.56 --> 2787.56
okay

2797.04 --> 2803.72
oh by the way thank you for sharing that

2799.44 --> 2803.7200000000003
earlier carolyn a about

2804.0 --> 2809.839
heard firsthand accounts

2808.079 --> 2812.0
so you haven't seen it yourself but

2809.839 --> 2814.319
you've heard other people that say they

2812.0 --> 2818.4
have witnessed ball lightning yeah ball

2814.319 --> 2820.88
lightning is weird very freaky

2818.4 --> 2823.44
there's some really brilliant videos

2820.88 --> 2825.839
about ball lightnings not like oh look

2823.44 --> 2828.88
at our document but just raw videos of

2825.839 --> 2830.96
ball lightning there's a lot of them

2828.88 --> 2831.839
i've seen a couple that are just like

2830.96 --> 2835.44
whoa

2831.839 --> 2835.44
what the [ __ ] is that

2835.68 --> 2839.0
pretty incredible

2862.319 --> 2865.319
hmm

2879.839 --> 2885.44
everything feels is level number doesn't

2882.4 --> 2886.64
just feel atom price it is level it is

2885.44 --> 2888.0
level like

2886.64 --> 2891.52
this is not

2888.0 --> 2892.88
up for debate anymore the earth is flat

2891.52 --> 2896.319
really

2892.88 --> 2897.76
it's really really flat

2896.319 --> 2900.88
and

2897.76 --> 2903.44
people that are just refusing to accept

2900.88 --> 2904.4
that they have a problem with themselves

2903.44 --> 2907.52
the most

2904.4 --> 2907.52
because it is flat

2908.4 --> 2911.92
if they can't handle that then they're

2910.319 --> 2915.359
gonna twist

2911.92 --> 2916.2400000000002
everything like everything in their mind

2915.359 --> 2918.88
to

2916.24 --> 2921.5989999999997
somehow make all that flatness into a

2918.88 --> 2923.28
ball again in their mind

2921.599 --> 2925.119
because it's never going to be like that

2923.28 --> 2929.6400000000003
in reality

2925.119 --> 2929.6400000000003
because it's all flat everything

2929.839 --> 2936.7599999999998
right the surface orientation of

2932.24 --> 2936.7599999999998
everything in this realm is flat

2947.98 --> 2951.05
[Music]

2951.68 --> 2954.68
hmm

2966.4 --> 2970.52
it feels obvious to me

2977.599 --> 2983.119
yeah okay i i just i don't know why your

2980.8 --> 2987.28
feelings have to do with that because it

2983.119 --> 2987.28
is it is just obvious to you

2989.04 --> 2993.119
right but once you snap into that

2993.28 --> 2997.599
it might feel like oh yeah of course i

2995.44 --> 2998.559
always got it

2997.599 --> 3000.8
because

2998.559 --> 3003.0400000000004
you switched away from the position

3000.8 --> 3006.559
where you would not accept it was like

3003.04 --> 3006.5589999999997
that if you even had any

3009.92 --> 3013.7200000000003
it is always flat

3018.13 --> 3021.28
[Music]

3028.48 --> 3032.48
keep asking if level on land

3033.04 --> 3037.48
is not the same as sea level

3040.72 --> 3045.2799999999997
but yeah

3042.079 --> 3049.599
now it is pretty much level ever like

3045.28 --> 3049.599
you use water to know whether it's level

3050.88 --> 3053.92
right and with the sea there's a lot of

3052.48 --> 3056.16
water on land you're going to have to

3053.92 --> 3059.92
take some of that water with you

3056.16 --> 3059.92
you could use like a bubble thingy

3067.599 --> 3074.8
but yeah level is the same

3070.48 --> 3074.8
like level is like the orientation

3077.359 --> 3083.2799999999997
i think it's the wind that causes the

3079.68 --> 3085.7599999999998
tides on the ocean no

3083.28 --> 3087.44
no there's some kind of a there's angel

3085.76 --> 3090.2400000000002
spoons as if

3087.44 --> 3092.88
as i've named them

3090.24 --> 3095.359
if you look at the tide maps there are

3092.88 --> 3097.6800000000003
maps with animations that show how the

3095.359 --> 3100.24
tides go

3097.68 --> 3101.359
it's that's not winds winds don't work

3100.24 --> 3103.9199999999996
like that

3101.359 --> 3106.5589999999997
not that slow right it's just something

3103.92 --> 3109.839
stirring it everywhere it's just a

3106.559 --> 3113.6800000000003
rotating thing everywhere there's tides

3109.839 --> 3113.68
so i think it's like magnetic spoons

3114.4 --> 3118.0
they're not literals i call them angel

3116.079 --> 3120.88
spoons just for the visualization

3118.0 --> 3122.96
something to latch onto

3120.88 --> 3126.079
but it's like a magnetic thing that's

3122.96 --> 3128.4
happening regionally it's not universal

3126.079 --> 3130.0
it's regional

3128.4 --> 3133.359
and it just

3130.0 --> 3133.359
stirs the water around

3133.44 --> 3136.96
and that whatever that is

3135.599 --> 3138.8
although it's very likely to be

3136.96 --> 3142.48
electrical in nature

3138.8 --> 3142.48
that's what's causing the tides

3143.28 --> 3147.3590000000004
not the winds absolutely not

3151.119 --> 3155.44
i mean what winds can do if they're like

3153.76 --> 3156.7200000000003
really heavy

3155.44 --> 3159.92
is

3156.72 --> 3163.4399999999996
blow an entire piece of water like on

3159.92 --> 3165.359
land for example right it can displace

3163.44 --> 3168.079
water

3165.359 --> 3170.96
in like extreme storms like hurricane

3168.079 --> 3171.92
type situations

3170.96 --> 3174.079
but

3171.92 --> 3177.44
overall no it's not the thing that

3174.079 --> 3180.319
actually causes the the universal tides

3177.44 --> 3183.52
which the tides also happen when when

3180.319 --> 3185.7599999999998
there's no storm whatsoever

3183.52 --> 3185.7599999999998
so

3187.2 --> 3190.8799999999997
doubt it has anything to do with it has

3188.96 --> 3193.359
nothing to do with the moon

3190.88 --> 3195.52
except that the moon might be some kind

3193.359 --> 3197.119
of a clock

3195.52 --> 3200.64
indicator because

3197.119 --> 3204.0
the tides do happen at very specific

3200.64 --> 3204.0
time-based intervals

3204.72 --> 3208.72
i don't know if they're like really tied

3206.48 --> 3211.44
in with the rhythm of the moon though

3208.72 --> 3213.2
because then over the day tides would

3211.44 --> 3216.0
actually change the moment when it

3213.2 --> 3218.16
happens because the moon is a longer

3216.0 --> 3219.44
cycle than the day so i'm not sure if

3218.16 --> 3221.68
even the moon

3219.44 --> 3224.88
on an astrological level has an

3221.68 --> 3224.8799999999997
influence on the tides

3227.76 --> 3231.2000000000003
i don't think so i think it's more bound

3229.92 --> 3233.599
by just the

3231.2 --> 3233.5989999999997
the sun

3234.319 --> 3240.72
tides are pretty stable at a certain

3236.64 --> 3240.72
time of the day and that doesn't change

3243.359 --> 3247.359
right

3244.559 --> 3249.44
as far as i know at least

3247.359 --> 3253.44
like the moments when tides happen they

3249.44 --> 3253.44
don't change over time right

3254.72 --> 3259.9199999999996
it's pretty much the same time every day

3257.599 --> 3262.319
so that means they're not moonbound that

3259.92 --> 3266.4
means they're sunbound because the sun

3262.319 --> 3269.2799999999997
is what creates the day cycle

3266.4 --> 3271.6800000000003
what where what our time is based on and

3269.28 --> 3273.92
the tides are then well bound by that

3271.68 --> 3275.9199999999996
same cycle that means that means it's

3273.92 --> 3277.52
astrologically bound by the sun and not

3275.92 --> 3279.44
the moon because the moon has a longer

3277.52 --> 3282.4
cycle

3279.44 --> 3285.599
if something is bound to the moon

3282.4 --> 3288.319
then it cannot be

3285.599 --> 3290.7200000000003
on the exact side same time

3288.319 --> 3293.359
in the day every day that that wouldn't

3290.72 --> 3296.359
make sense because the moon has a longer

3293.359 --> 3296.359
cycle

3306.24 --> 3310.16
oh my god there's another squirter

3308.72 --> 3312.8799999999997
baller in here

3310.16 --> 3316.72
the moon clearly causes the time we've

3312.88 --> 3318.839
known this forever yes squirty boy

3316.72 --> 3321.839
i'm sure that's what you

3318.839 --> 3324.5589999999997
believe when somebody told you that when

3321.839 --> 3324.5589999999997
you were six

3328.48 --> 3333.2
explain how the sun would affect the

3330.48 --> 3335.04
tide no it doesn't actually affect it

3333.2 --> 3338.3999999999996
right i already said

3335.04 --> 3340.88
nothing but celestial lights actually in

3338.4 --> 3342.64
a direct sense influence the tide

3340.88 --> 3345.359
nothing does

3342.64 --> 3346.48
right it has to be a local magnetic

3345.359 --> 3348.24
effect

3346.48 --> 3350.64
that does it because there's something

3348.24 --> 3352.799
stirring in the oceans

3350.64 --> 3355.359
not lights

3352.799 --> 3356.64
yeah because there's no gravitation

3355.359 --> 3358.5589999999997
causing that

3356.64 --> 3361.2
because that would be a

3358.559 --> 3364.6400000000003
whole bunch of presuppositions way too

3361.2 --> 3366.319
far outside of reality to accept

3364.64 --> 3368.799
because none of the celestial lights are

3366.319 --> 3372.0
physical bodies none of them

3368.799 --> 3374.24
it's all holographic only light only

3372.0 --> 3374.24
light

3374.799 --> 3380.559
there's no object anywhere

3377.04 --> 3383.52
doing that it's just light manifesting

3380.559 --> 3386.6400000000003
right but there are things bound to the

3383.52 --> 3389.359
sky clock to the astrology to the

3386.64 --> 3393.7599999999998
astrological cycles of the celestial

3389.359 --> 3395.52
lights which they are they are a clock

3393.76 --> 3398.0
so what i was saying is it's not

3395.52 --> 3400.559
moonbound because the moon has a longer

3398.0 --> 3403.2
cycle than the sun it's

3400.559 --> 3405.76
if something is bound by the celestial

3403.2 --> 3407.9199999999996
lights

3405.76 --> 3410.4
time-based factor right that's what

3407.92 --> 3412.319
makes it astrological then it would be

3410.4 --> 3413.92
bound by that cycle and that means that

3412.319 --> 3417.44
the tides would be

3413.92 --> 3419.52
moving around over the days

3417.44 --> 3422.559
they don't they're pretty much on the

3419.52 --> 3424.079
exact same time in the sa in the day

3422.559 --> 3427.8390000000004
which means they're bound to the

3424.079 --> 3427.8390000000004
astrological cycle of the sun

3429.04 --> 3433.359
right that's why

3430.48 --> 3437.119
our clocks match

3433.359 --> 3437.119
the the astrology of the sun

3440.16 --> 3444.799
so if something matches well that time

3442.48 --> 3447.04
system it's like the same time every day

3444.799 --> 3449.04
that means it's astrologically bound to

3447.04 --> 3451.7599999999998
the sun whatever it is

3449.04 --> 3453.7599999999998
but the sun doesn't cause it because

3451.76 --> 3456.2400000000002
it's not an object that does anything

3453.76 --> 3459.7990000000004
it's just a light manifestation

3456.24 --> 3459.799
so is the moon

3460.4 --> 3463.92
you have went down the rabbit hole yeah

3462.24 --> 3466.5589999999997
no [ __ ]

3463.92 --> 3466.559
i know that

3467.359 --> 3471.64
guess you just had to find out

3477.599 --> 3482.48
we don't base the clock over them oh

3479.92 --> 3485.6800000000003
really then why do you have a 24-hour

3482.48 --> 3485.68
day numpty

3486.48 --> 3491.44
well are you an idiot

3488.96 --> 3495.839
you're saying that the clocks

3491.44 --> 3501.4
yeah our 24-hour clock system is not

3495.839 --> 3501.4
based on the sun cycle do you really

3502.16 --> 3505.839
sounds like you're completely making up

3504.48 --> 3508.4
[ __ ] that you don't know what you're

3505.839 --> 3508.4
talking about

3512.0 --> 3516.96
right it's not oh well why don't you

3513.92 --> 3518.64
explain it to me then huh if you're so

3516.96 --> 3521.04
smart

3518.64 --> 3522.319
mister i'm not gonna go down that rabbit

3521.04 --> 3524.0
hole

3522.319 --> 3527.2799999999997
because you're afraid

3524.0 --> 3527.28
to eat a little dirt

3528.72 --> 3533.839
right oh my god i might get dirty in my

3530.96 --> 3535.92
mouth i'm so scared of the dirt

3533.839 --> 3537.04
i'm not going down that rabbit hole i'm

3535.92 --> 3541.28
just gonna

3537.04 --> 3543.359
echo really stupid things

3541.28 --> 3546.6400000000003
that even aren't even based in

3543.359 --> 3546.64
heliocentric lore

3546.88 --> 3552.4
a whole different oh yeah the whole body

3550.24 --> 3554.9599999999996
of smurfs yeah

3552.4 --> 3557.119
oh keep track of time yeah yeah yeah but

3554.96 --> 3559.92
what is it actually based on though you

3557.119 --> 3561.28
know what is a clock based on why is it

3559.92 --> 3564.0
24 hours

3561.28 --> 3566.2400000000002
could it have something to do with the

3564.0 --> 3569.52
sun cycle

3566.24 --> 3571.5989999999997
mr numpty who literally doesn't know

3569.52 --> 3573.44
what the [ __ ] he's talking about

3571.599 --> 3577.319
he doesn't even understand the language

3573.44 --> 3577.319
he's using right now

3596.4 --> 3600.7200000000003
yeah

3598.319 --> 3603.2
i try to explain that to him like dude

3600.72 --> 3604.3999999999996
pick another name by the way

3603.2 --> 3606.64
i mean it

3604.4 --> 3611.0
don't care if you're gonna be sensible

3606.64 --> 3611.0
you pick another name or you're banned

3621.359 --> 3624.4
a bunch of kyles

3626.079 --> 3629.119
yeah you already quit

3627.76 --> 3632.559
i think

3629.119 --> 3635.52
these two people are one p person

3632.559 --> 3637.76
i think it's another infiltrator

3635.52 --> 3639.119
because i get those now

3637.76 --> 3641.92
yeah oh

3639.119 --> 3644.559
oh two different accounts oh oh we're

3641.92 --> 3646.559
not the same person we're not here to go

3644.559 --> 3648.88
back and forth and try to

3646.559 --> 3650.3190000000004
railroad the entire conversation towards

3648.88 --> 3651.839
something completely different to

3650.319 --> 3654.96
detract away

3651.839 --> 3657.68
from the very fine-tuned data that is

3654.96 --> 3661.119
being presented yeah

3657.68 --> 3663.04
you think i don't catch on to that

3661.119 --> 3664.319
you don't think i know how far you guys

3663.04 --> 3667.319
go

3664.319 --> 3667.319
psychos

3670.4 --> 3674.48
no

3671.2 --> 3674.48
i'm just going to ignore you

3680.079 --> 3686.0
hey thomas larson yeah fresh water does

3683.2 --> 3688.799
not yeah but fresh water is not it

3686.0 --> 3688.799
doesn't tide

3688.96 --> 3693.04
right tide only happens in salt water

3696.0 --> 3699.319
in the ocean

3702.48 --> 3705.839
this is interesting though

3706.24 --> 3711.68
there are some pretty big big salt lakes

3709.359 --> 3714.4
right in the world that are separated

3711.68 --> 3716.64
from the ocean

3714.4 --> 3720.88
are there places where like isolated

3716.64 --> 3720.8799999999997
salt lakes also have tides

3721.119 --> 3725.6800000000003
i don't know if there is but that would

3723.2 --> 3728.5589999999997
be really interesting

3725.68 --> 3730.5589999999997
is there like a really big salt lake

3728.559 --> 3732.559
somewhere in the world

3730.559 --> 3734.799
where there's still water and that there

3732.559 --> 3738.44
is kind of a tide effect i'd be very

3734.799 --> 3738.44
curious to know

3746.64 --> 3752.319
yeah thanks bill nye designs and i know

3748.88 --> 3752.319
it's so getting so obvious

3753.2 --> 3758.1189999999997
yeah and you're getting out of here both

3754.96 --> 3758.119
of you

3775.44 --> 3780.64
seriously you're not going to unrail

3778.559 --> 3782.4
like the most basic

3780.64 --> 3783.359
of lures

3782.4 --> 3784.7200000000003
yeah

3783.359 --> 3788.24
you're gonna say

3784.72 --> 3790.48
no the tides are not

3788.24 --> 3794.0
bound by the sun

3790.48 --> 3797.68
which is what our time system is based

3794.0 --> 3799.599
on 24 hours is based on the solar cycle

3797.68 --> 3801.9199999999996
right if you're done then gonna say oh

3799.599 --> 3805.119
no the tides are not based

3801.92 --> 3806.7200000000003
on the solar cycle

3805.119 --> 3809.119
because

3806.72 --> 3812.9599999999996
because what because oh there's other

3809.119 --> 3815.119
ways to derive time now we just

3812.96 --> 3817.44
just ignore that

3815.119 --> 3820.0
to somehow maneuver away from an

3817.44 --> 3820.799
argument it's insane

3820.0 --> 3822.319
ah

3820.799 --> 3824.799
thank you for that i thought you were

3822.319 --> 3827.359
actually a counter troll but you're not

3824.799 --> 3827.359
good to hear

3835.359 --> 3840.16
that mean to offend that's okay i

3837.359 --> 3840.16
appreciate that

3845.2 --> 3849.52
it's just that in my experience people

3846.96 --> 3851.92
that choose name with poop in them or

3849.52 --> 3854.559
something are usually just trolls

3851.92 --> 3856.319
they're not there to inform they're to

3854.559 --> 3858.079
distract and just

3856.319 --> 3860.0
create a ruckus

3858.079 --> 3862.1600000000003
that's my experience

3860.0 --> 3864.079
so that's why i don't respond well to

3862.16 --> 3867.3999999999996
people that use that in their name

3864.079 --> 3867.4
that's fine

3871.44 --> 3874.559
thank you for correcting

3876.24 --> 3880.2799999999997
you did make a decent point

3884.96 --> 3889.599
right but the whole point that i was

3886.88 --> 3891.6800000000003
making again let me say it again

3889.599 --> 3893.039
the tides right

3891.68 --> 3894.64
the moon

3893.039 --> 3898.88
when it goes around

3894.64 --> 3898.8799999999997
is more than 24 hours

3899.039 --> 3901.76
sun goes around

3900.799 --> 3903.7599999999998
it's

3901.76 --> 3906.0
conceptual right it's a celestial it

3903.76 --> 3909.5200000000004
doesn't actually do anything but yeah we

3906.0 --> 3911.76
always see it through angles the

3909.52 --> 3914.48
holographic manifestation but the sun

3911.76 --> 3916.7200000000003
goes around in 24 hours

3914.48 --> 3918.64
that's what our clocks are based on so

3916.72 --> 3922.319
if something then

3918.64 --> 3924.16
periodically on a daily basis

3922.319 --> 3926.48
is a returning phenomena oh look the

3924.16 --> 3929.2
phenomenon it's happening again exactly

3926.48 --> 3930.799
at the same hour the next day well there

3929.2 --> 3934.0789999999997
you go that means

3930.799 --> 3936.0
it's bound by the astrological cycle of

3934.079 --> 3940.7200000000003
the sun

3936.0 --> 3940.72
it's a very direct mechanical conclusion

3944.64 --> 3950.44
you could say it's solar it's a solar

3946.88 --> 3950.44
bound phenomena

3950.559 --> 3955.2000000000003
now if it wasn't that and it actually

3953.44 --> 3957.92
kept shifting

3955.2 --> 3957.9199999999996
every day

3958.319 --> 3961.52
then

3959.28 --> 3963.28
if it actually correlates perfectly with

3961.52 --> 3966.96
the cycle of the moon then you could say

3963.28 --> 3968.88
this is a lunar bound phenomena

3966.96 --> 3970.64
based on the astrological cycle of the

3968.88 --> 3971.599
moon

3970.64 --> 3974.0
see

3971.599 --> 3977.0
it's a very simple way of approaching

3974.0 --> 3977.0
that

3978.319 --> 3983.2
and the funny thing is like you it's

3980.559 --> 3984.4
even like it's

3983.2 --> 3986.799
it's not even

3984.4 --> 3987.7200000000003
not compatible

3986.799 --> 3990.559
with

3987.72 --> 3992.9599999999996
heliocentrism it just doesn't entertain

3990.559 --> 3995.52
the nonsense stories like the moon's

3992.96 --> 3998.64
gravity is pulling the tides like yeah

3995.52 --> 4000.88
it's not going to entertain that

3998.64 --> 4002.5589999999997
but it is compatible because the cycles

4000.88 --> 4005.799
are what they are

4002.559 --> 4005.799
they're there

4009.68 --> 4016.319
the tides in the great lakes are so

4012.079 --> 4018.96
small that they are amassed by the waves

4016.319 --> 4021.52
but do they happen though

4018.96 --> 4024.319
i'm not saying oh it's too small but

4021.52 --> 4026.799
there's actually

4024.319 --> 4027.7599999999998
tidal effects there is some shift is

4026.799 --> 4030.4
there

4027.76 --> 4031.599
in the in the salt lakes really thomas

4030.4 --> 4035.799
larson

4031.599 --> 4035.799
how do you know i'm curious

4042.72 --> 4045.5989999999997
the way they say the moon affects the

4044.319 --> 4047.839
tides would

4045.599 --> 4050.4
massive earthquake dude there would be

4047.839 --> 4052.319
daily tsunamis

4050.4 --> 4054.799
literally they've even shown you the

4052.319 --> 4058.16
model like how they would literally just

4054.799 --> 4060.079
tsunami every freaking day it's crazy

4058.16 --> 4063.7599999999998
none of that works it's completely

4060.079 --> 4068.0
ridiculous that they say that

4063.76 --> 4072.599
it's like a very poorly made excuse

4068.0 --> 4072.599
that wasn't thought out very well

4082.64 --> 4089.2
he changes the size of things including

4085.2 --> 4089.2
most water okay yeah there's a point

4089.28 --> 4092.7200000000003
yeah

4090.64 --> 4094.96
i don't think that the temperature of

4092.72 --> 4097.12
the water is really any influence on the

4094.96 --> 4101.0
tides though

4097.12 --> 4101.0
maybe the other way around

4109.759 --> 4113.679
i don't know but it's still like yeah

4111.679 --> 4117.4400000000005
the tides are interesting what is it

4113.679 --> 4120.319
what actually causes that

4117.44 --> 4123.12
i say angel spoons but that's only just

4120.319 --> 4125.679
a description to kind of wrap your head

4123.12 --> 4125.679
around it

4126.64 --> 4130.12
it's not literal

4143.44 --> 4148.159
some electromagnetic effects all bodies

4145.6 --> 4151.52
well it would be all salt waters all

4148.159 --> 4154.719
salt water bodies would be affected

4151.52 --> 4154.719
that's why i asked like

4155.04 --> 4158.159
does it

4156.08 --> 4161.839
influence

4158.159 --> 4161.839
isolated salt lakes

4173.199 --> 4178.3189999999995
huh

4175.12 --> 4178.3189999999995
yeah that's my dude

4179.04 --> 4182.88
yeah they say uh

4181.04 --> 4185.44
literally just the heliocentric

4182.88 --> 4189.6
storytellers make up like the craziest

4185.44 --> 4191.5199999999995
of sci-fi nonsense sometimes

4189.6 --> 4194.4800000000005
and when they go there it's

4191.52 --> 4198.080000000001
they really lose all track of logic

4194.48 --> 4198.08
they make the most silly claims

4200.0 --> 4204.48
i mean that's how you end up claiming

4202.56 --> 4207.360000000001
you have a moon rock that is actually

4204.48 --> 4207.36
petrified wood

4207.84 --> 4210.8
that's how you do that

4209.44 --> 4213.199
just like

4210.8 --> 4215.52
squirting nonsense

4213.199 --> 4217.28
and just not even taking the story

4215.52 --> 4219.360000000001
serious

4217.28 --> 4221.04
just going wherever you want to

4219.36 --> 4223.679
improvise to go

4221.04 --> 4225.84
not caring for logical consistency and

4223.679 --> 4228.2390000000005
anymore it's like oh we have the power

4225.84 --> 4231.04
now we don't need to not be logically

4228.239 --> 4232.48
consistent anymore oh

4231.04 --> 4233.92
yeah and that's how that sort of

4232.48 --> 4236.48
nonsense then

4233.92 --> 4236.4800000000005
comes out

4237.679 --> 4242.56
like oh the moon is slowly

4240.4 --> 4245.839999999999
moving away from earth so there will be

4242.56 --> 4245.84
no more tides yeah that

4246.64 --> 4250.400000000001
like you really have to be like a

4248.4 --> 4252.639999999999
ridiculous fantasist to come up with

4250.4 --> 4252.639999999999
that

4255.679 --> 4259.679
because there's no hint of that

4257.04 --> 4260.96
whatsoever like none

4259.679 --> 4263.4400000000005
there's no

4260.96 --> 4265.28
indication or sighting that would even

4263.44 --> 4266.879999999999
suggest that like where are you getting

4265.28 --> 4268.88
that one the moon is slowly drifting

4266.88 --> 4272.08
away it's always been

4268.88 --> 4274.2390000000005
the exact same angular size just like

4272.08 --> 4276.32
the sun so what the hell you mean it's

4274.239 --> 4277.12
drifting away where are you getting that

4276.32 --> 4279.5199999999995
from

4277.12 --> 4281.44
you it was literally made up out of

4279.52 --> 4285.719
nothing

4281.44 --> 4285.719
just to make some stupid story

4298.8 --> 4301.8
it

4303.28 --> 4308.4
tight clocks are real and follow them

4306.8 --> 4311.52
that's

4308.4 --> 4314.719
that is preposterous jim smith are you

4311.52 --> 4318.4800000000005
the same guy again

4314.719 --> 4318.4800000000005
dude you really need to get a grip

4325.04 --> 4330.4
oh watch it the water is not affected

4328.32 --> 4333.12
that's not true

4330.4 --> 4336.4
sweet water bodies are completely

4333.12 --> 4337.679
unaffected jim smith

4336.4 --> 4341.5599999999995
completely

4337.679 --> 4341.56
so you're just wrong

4378.96 --> 4382.56
abolish would love to have their gravity

4380.719 --> 4384.32
back yeah they would

4382.56 --> 4386.88
but they never had eddie in the first

4384.32 --> 4388.88
place but look they can still think of

4386.88 --> 4391.4400000000005
their gravity being a force and all that

4388.88 --> 4393.679
and that newtonian mecha it's like

4391.44 --> 4394.879999999999
as a heliocentrist it's very well

4393.679 --> 4396.88
condoned

4394.88 --> 4398.4800000000005
to act

4396.88 --> 4400.4400000000005
onto nostalgia

4398.48 --> 4403.678999999999
right nostalgia has a big thing for

4400.44 --> 4405.678999999999
heliocentrism in general

4403.679 --> 4408.0
like that's why the moon landing is

4405.679 --> 4410.88
still so special

4408.0 --> 4414.48
it's all this all in nostalgia

4410.88 --> 4417.28
right so you can think that newton

4414.48 --> 4418.718999999999
still had it right and that his

4417.28 --> 4421.44
conception

4418.719 --> 4423.04
this claim to be a hypothesis by himself

4421.44 --> 4424.5599999999995
in writing

4423.04 --> 4426.96
you can still think that that's a

4424.56 --> 4429.4400000000005
legitimate proof for gravity and that

4426.96 --> 4431.12
that describes it well but officially

4429.44 --> 4434.08
it's not right but

4431.12 --> 4435.679
it's fair yeah nostalgia is a very

4434.08 --> 4438.0
condoned

4435.679 --> 4440.2390000000005
cultural choice

4438.0 --> 4442.96
within heliocentrism

4440.239 --> 4445.12
so you could absolutely think

4442.96 --> 4446.08
that gravity is still a force like

4445.12 --> 4447.84
newton

4446.08 --> 4449.28
like newton's model and you can still

4447.84 --> 4450.400000000001
use that right

4449.28 --> 4451.92
but

4450.4 --> 4454.0
yeah

4451.92 --> 4456.0
you're not really going to achieve

4454.0 --> 4457.679
anything with that

4456.0 --> 4460.96
you're just going to be blabbering on

4457.679 --> 4462.88
and with severely outdated information

4460.96 --> 4464.96
not letting that go right which is

4462.88 --> 4468.88
typically nostalgic and that's very well

4464.96 --> 4470.96
condoned just don't expect to actually

4468.88 --> 4472.88
change anything with that it's just

4470.96 --> 4475.76
blabbering away

4472.88 --> 4479.04
just blabbering nostalgically about

4475.76 --> 4480.88
things that aren't even claimed anymore

4479.04 --> 4482.96
right

4480.88 --> 4486.4400000000005
doesn't actually achieve anything nor

4482.96 --> 4486.44
win an argument

4500.56 --> 4503.84
accept that it works

4505.44 --> 4508.239
no it doesn't

4508.719 --> 4514.4800000000005
and that's officially admitted that it

4511.199 --> 4517.759999999999
doesn't work yeah gravity isn't a force

4514.48 --> 4520.0
it doesn't work it's not claimed anymore

4517.76 --> 4523.4400000000005
i mean people still nostalgically

4520.0 --> 4526.0
blabber on and that's very well condoned

4523.44 --> 4527.36
but when you really

4526.0 --> 4530.159
inquire

4527.36 --> 4532.639999999999
with people that are supposed to get it

4530.159 --> 4534.08
right because it's their profession yeah

4532.64 --> 4538.2390000000005
they're gonna tell you no it doesn't

4534.08 --> 4540.159
work it doesn't work devil's fat forget

4538.239 --> 4543.199
doesn't work

4540.159 --> 4543.199
gravity doesn't work

4545.199 --> 4550.799999999999
it's just a mathematical concept now

4548.719 --> 4552.8
it's still being

4550.8 --> 4555.76
figured out

4552.8 --> 4558.719
what it is this is a search

4555.76 --> 4562.159000000001
it's like a scientific quest the quest

4558.719 --> 4563.52
to find out what gravity really is

4562.159 --> 4565.12
because you got just a bunch of

4563.52 --> 4567.040000000001
mathematical

4565.12 --> 4568.5599999999995
space space-time bending descriptions

4567.04 --> 4571.36
now

4568.56 --> 4573.84
that don't even have a phenomenon

4571.36 --> 4576.5599999999995
they're not even physics right so

4573.84 --> 4578.32
there's a quest now let's figure out

4576.56 --> 4581.76
what this gravity is

4578.32 --> 4583.199
oh and dude that's been an ongoing

4581.76 --> 4584.0
process

4583.199 --> 4587.28
for

4584.0 --> 4590.48
my entire life and more

4587.28 --> 4592.96
where people dedicate their entire lives

4590.48 --> 4595.839999999999
to trying to figure out what freaking

4592.96 --> 4598.04
gravity is and how to prove it

4595.84 --> 4600.32
so all this nonsense came out of it like

4598.04 --> 4603.44
gravitational waves

4600.32 --> 4606.239
oh look it's a ripple of gravity oh it's

4603.44 --> 4608.879999999999
just crazy assertions

4606.239 --> 4610.799999999999
and all of them do nothing but just like

4608.88 --> 4614.0
oh it's something shook a little it must

4610.8 --> 4616.400000000001
be gravity it must be a wave of gravity

4614.0 --> 4618.719
falling back to the assumption again

4616.4 --> 4621.04
that oh yeah that's because it's a force

4618.719 --> 4623.44
right gravitation is a force then if

4621.04 --> 4625.679
it's going to actually do anything

4623.44 --> 4628.239
yeah well that's not what the einstein

4625.679 --> 4631.28
model says but yeah we're still allowed

4628.239 --> 4634.639999999999
to think of it as a force so the people

4631.28 --> 4637.199
will buy it out of sheer nostalgia

4634.64 --> 4639.679
it doesn't actually prove anything

4637.199 --> 4642.0
doesn't prove einstein's model doesn't

4639.679 --> 4643.76
prove gravity but you can think that it

4642.0 --> 4646.159
proves gravity and it'll keep people

4643.76 --> 4648.08
busy for a while and then the person

4646.159 --> 4650.799999999999
that came up with it can make their

4648.08 --> 4653.44
career out of it and grandstand about

4650.8 --> 4655.76
how intellectual he is to everybody

4653.44 --> 4655.759999999999
yeah

4655.92 --> 4659.56
that's how that works

4678.08 --> 4680.88
what the hell

4689.12 --> 4694.8
ah oh thank you cow apple thank you i

4691.84 --> 4697.28
knew it was that

4694.8 --> 4699.92
yeah because the earlier somebody said

4697.28 --> 4702.239
that gyroscope drifted and then i said

4699.92 --> 4704.56
no it must be broken then because it's

4702.239 --> 4706.718999999999
designed and used as a technology

4704.56 --> 4709.1990000000005
specifically not to drift so thank you

4706.719 --> 4711.12
for that input

4709.199 --> 4712.879999999999
yeah it can drift because of an

4711.12 --> 4714.48
imbalance and then if you spin it the

4712.88 --> 4716.8
other way it's going to turn the other

4714.48 --> 4720.718999999999
way yeah exactly that's how you know

4716.8 --> 4722.56
it's basically broken that it's it's uh

4720.719 --> 4724.2390000000005
yeah it's not a good gyroscope because

4722.56 --> 4726.2390000000005
it drifts

4724.239 --> 4728.639999999999
it's not in balance thank you for that

4726.239 --> 4728.639999999999
data

4733.36 --> 4738.32
the newton's equation have been proven

4736.0 --> 4738.32
yes

4738.8 --> 4740.96
no

4747.44 --> 4752.32
doesn't change that the fact that he

4749.36 --> 4752.32
created the

4752.719 --> 4756.88
calculus that modern scientists are

4755.76 --> 4758.56
trying to

4756.88 --> 4760.4800000000005
what

4758.56 --> 4762.64
what does calculus have to do with

4760.48 --> 4765.678999999999
scientists

4762.64 --> 4768.08
with science it's calculus it's just

4765.679 --> 4771.12
conception

4768.08 --> 4771.12
calculus is a

4772.08 --> 4778.159
it's not science science actually is a

4774.96 --> 4780.56
method that proves the cause of an

4778.159 --> 4784.08
effect which has to be a naturally

4780.56 --> 4786.64
occurring non-man-made phenomenon

4784.08 --> 4788.48
and you have to very manipulate it in

4786.64 --> 4791.84
order to prove

4788.48 --> 4791.839999999999
that it is the cause

4792.48 --> 4794.799999999999
yeah

4793.36 --> 4799.199
calculus

4794.8 --> 4799.1990000000005
doesn't do anything it's just like uh

4800.32 --> 4803.679
yeah

4801.12 --> 4806.639
calculus is like the leather

4803.679 --> 4810.08
on the seat of a car it doesn't make the

4806.639 --> 4811.6
car drive but it's really nice to sit on

4810.08 --> 4813.76
right

4811.6 --> 4815.6
doesn't actually make the the car be a

4813.76 --> 4817.92
car though

4815.6 --> 4820.08
right that's calculus it that's not

4817.92 --> 4822.639
science you see

4820.08 --> 4825.04
it's the descriptive language that can

4822.639 --> 4828.32
be used to clarify

4825.04 --> 4830.0
the process which has to be an empirical

4828.32 --> 4833.679
method

4830.0 --> 4835.6
where you vary as the experimenter

4833.679 --> 4837.52
vary and manipulate

4835.6 --> 4839.52
the cause of the effect which has to be

4837.52 --> 4842.159000000001
a naturally occurring phenomena that's

4839.52 --> 4844.320000000001
science calculus

4842.159 --> 4846.96
is nothing but the leather on the seat

4844.32 --> 4849.12
of the car it's not the car

4846.96 --> 4850.56
doesn't actually do anything it just

4849.12 --> 4851.599999999999
makes it a little bit more smooth or

4850.56 --> 4852.719
whatever

4851.6 --> 4854.320000000001
right

4852.719 --> 4856.88
you don't need

4854.32 --> 4858.4
calculus or math

4856.88 --> 4860.1990000000005
for science

4858.4 --> 4861.839999999999
at all

4860.199 --> 4864.32
completely

4861.84 --> 4867.360000000001
scrap it out you don't have to use a

4864.32 --> 4869.759999999999
single number

4867.36 --> 4872.88
or calculus type

4869.76 --> 4876.96
symbol for multiplication or anything no

4872.88 --> 4878.32
math has to be involved whatsoever

4876.96 --> 4881.44
with science

4878.32 --> 4882.719
no math has to be involved

4881.44 --> 4883.919999999999
because

4882.719 --> 4887.96
science

4883.92 --> 4887.96
doesn't require math

4889.04 --> 4895.04
only requires

4891.679 --> 4899.76
cause of an effect to be established by

4895.04 --> 4902.08
the experimenter manipulating that cause

4899.76 --> 4903.92
with which has to also be a naturally

4902.08 --> 4905.44
occurring phenomenon can be just a thing

4903.92 --> 4910.0
that happens

4905.44 --> 4910.0
in a thing because he made that thing

4910.48 --> 4915.599999999999
it has to be existing naturally

4913.679 --> 4919.12
the phenomenon that is being fairy to

4915.6 --> 4922.56
manipulate to establish its cause

4919.12 --> 4922.5599999999995
that doesn't require math

4923.84 --> 4929.32
hey voynich

4925.44 --> 4929.32
seen you in a long time

4934.48 --> 4937.669999999999
[Music]

4948.239 --> 4953.48
right anyway i'm taking two minute break

4949.92 --> 4953.4800000000005
i'll be right back

4954.97 --> 4958.27
[Music]

4964.96 --> 4967.96
so

5057.199 --> 5060.199
huh

5072.639 --> 5077.12
i'm gonna call today's show let them eat

5075.36 --> 5078.32
dirt

5077.12 --> 5080.239
i love it

5078.32 --> 5084.599999999999
i might have called another early bird

5080.239 --> 5084.599999999999
show like that a long time ago

5108.48 --> 5112.919999999999
the research dark matter

5113.36 --> 5120.0
why would you research dark matter

5116.639 --> 5120.96
it's just a concept it only even existed

5120.0 --> 5123.199
to

5120.96 --> 5125.44
try to balance

5123.199 --> 5126.879999999999
the equation

5125.44 --> 5129.5199999999995
of gravity

5126.88 --> 5132.639
that was used like the newtonian type of

5129.52 --> 5134.400000000001
gravity equation that was used

5132.639 --> 5136.96
to model

5134.4 --> 5139.199
the heliocentric universe that's why

5136.96 --> 5140.88
dark matter existed to balance that

5139.199 --> 5142.4
equation because

5140.88 --> 5143.1990000000005
the gap

5142.4 --> 5145.44
like

5143.199 --> 5148.32
it just wouldn't fit it wouldn't work

5145.44 --> 5150.799999999999
out that's why they needed it

5148.32 --> 5152.96
they needed dark matter which is a pure

5150.8 --> 5155.4400000000005
concept that can never be proven like

5152.96 --> 5157.44
even theoretically dark matter cannot be

5155.44 --> 5160.5599999999995
proven i mean you could

5157.44 --> 5163.199
squirt all day long and fantasize how

5160.56 --> 5165.6
you would derive the track blah blah

5163.199 --> 5167.678999999999
blah prove it anyway

5165.6 --> 5171.360000000001
but it's per definition by its

5167.679 --> 5174.639
description absolutely unprovable

5171.36 --> 5177.28
the only reason it's assumed is because

5174.639 --> 5179.679
if they didn't assume it then everything

5177.28 --> 5183.84
they believed in would be wrong

5179.679 --> 5187.1990000000005
it's literally the only reason it exists

5183.84 --> 5189.52
right because it's unmeasurable

5187.199 --> 5192.638999999999
it's invisible

5189.52 --> 5192.639
and unmeasurable

5195.12 --> 5202.32
like there's no way to detect it

5197.52 --> 5203.52
so that means you could never prove it

5202.32 --> 5206.48
that's it

5203.52 --> 5209.6
it's just a magoffin substance to

5206.48 --> 5213.239
balance a broken equation

5209.6 --> 5213.2390000000005
that's dark matter

5226.48 --> 5230.239
dark matter aka pixie sprinkles that's

5228.56 --> 5233.280000000001
right hello stopping traffic i'm

5230.239 --> 5233.28
arrested good see you

5235.52 --> 5240.0
just like gravity well gravity is the

5237.6 --> 5241.04
thing that broke it in the first place

5240.0 --> 5243.92
blue

5241.04 --> 5243.92
y4j

5246.4 --> 5249.759999999999
right

5247.76 --> 5253.04
if they hadn't used gravity then they

5249.76 --> 5255.52
wouldn't have needed dark matter

5253.04 --> 5258.56
it was because they utilized gravity

5255.52 --> 5258.56
that it went wrong

5262.639 --> 5268.639
hey good surfing good to see

5264.84 --> 5268.639
you how are you doing man

5272.56 --> 5277.52
and science proved you were wrong just

5274.48 --> 5277.5199999999995
make [ __ ] up well that's

5295.36 --> 5298.36
huh

5320.08 --> 5324.48
oh man

5321.199 --> 5324.48
i'm getting really hungry

5324.56 --> 5328.679
but i also want to keep going

5355.92 --> 5361.92
is it a dirt tea what

5359.76 --> 5361.92
no

5362.96 --> 5367.199
is that what you wish no i was no

5364.8 --> 5370.2390000000005
literally let them eat dirt

5367.199 --> 5372.5599999999995
i eat dirt right this is not like oh

5370.239 --> 5374.879999999999
oh everybody else just has to eat dirt

5372.56 --> 5377.04
but that's kind of

5374.88 --> 5379.1990000000005
that's a joke you see

5377.04 --> 5381.679
it's based on let them eat cake

5379.199 --> 5384.4
which was like a profoundly ignorant

5381.679 --> 5387.679
statement this like a personification of

5384.4 --> 5389.599999999999
ignorance of that era

5387.679 --> 5392.88
this is actually

5389.6 --> 5395.52
something i recommend because i do it

5392.88 --> 5396.88
because it's worked really well for me

5395.52 --> 5399.76
and yeah

5396.88 --> 5399.76
it's just dirt

5400.239 --> 5405.12
like let them eat dirt sounds like oh

5403.28 --> 5408.32
let them bite the dust or something

5405.12 --> 5410.719
right but it's actually genuinely good

5408.32 --> 5414.199
advice

5410.719 --> 5414.199
that's the joke

5444.239 --> 5448.32
all you need to do is zoom in on the

5445.92 --> 5450.96
star in space is debunked

5448.32 --> 5453.36
well not even that

5450.96 --> 5456.08
i mean you could do that

5453.36 --> 5457.92
but if you just realize that

5456.08 --> 5459.199
it doesn't even make sense that all that

5457.92 --> 5462.0
light is

5459.199 --> 5464.08
being arrived here over that like that

5462.0 --> 5466.0
light doesn't travel

5464.08 --> 5468.719
that kind of a distance

5466.0 --> 5473.199
it doesn't do that

5468.719 --> 5475.88
also like yeah in for square law right

5473.199 --> 5477.839999999999
it's not like oh it it because it's

5475.88 --> 5479.4400000000005
supposedly all that light's going

5477.84 --> 5480.4800000000005
through a vacuum

5479.44 --> 5484.0
then it

5480.48 --> 5485.36
just goes longer no the infrasquare law

5484.0 --> 5486.719
of light

5485.36 --> 5488.239
just applies

5486.719 --> 5491.679
right

5488.239 --> 5494.879999999999
i mean it gets more absorbed if there's

5491.679 --> 5496.0
a lot of matter there right like air or

5494.88 --> 5497.6
whatever

5496.0 --> 5500.48
then it's lessened

5497.6 --> 5503.4400000000005
but even theoretically in a vacuum light

5500.48 --> 5504.959999999999
does not shine on forever

5503.44 --> 5507.44
it doesn't

5504.96 --> 5509.76
it always will decrease in energy and i

5507.44 --> 5512.08
have my own theory as to why because i

5509.76 --> 5514.159000000001
think that light is actually

5512.08 --> 5516.639
infinitely divisible

5514.159 --> 5516.638999999999
beams

5516.719 --> 5522.4
that literally they split up infinitely

5520.0 --> 5523.92
until they just they don't have strength

5522.4 --> 5525.679
anymore and

5523.92 --> 5528.639
they're not enough

5525.679 --> 5531.679
light energy to be absorbed by matter in

5528.639 --> 5534.2390000000005
order to register it

5531.679 --> 5536.56
if you realize that

5534.239 --> 5538.32
that light simply cannot travel that

5536.56 --> 5540.4800000000005
kind of a distance

5538.32 --> 5543.28
that debunks the entire premise that

5540.48 --> 5545.759999999999
they're all giant stars far away

5543.28 --> 5548.8
they're all giant sun supposedly fiery

5545.76 --> 5552.2390000000005
balls at a huge distance like no

5548.8 --> 5554.2390000000005
that just can't happen that's a physical

5552.239 --> 5557.12
impossibility

5554.239 --> 5558.48
like god cannot design the realm like

5557.12 --> 5560.88
that

5558.48 --> 5563.599999999999
physical reality cannot be like that

5560.88 --> 5566.2390000000005
that's not how the mechanics work they

5563.6 --> 5568.4800000000005
cannot be made to work like that no

5566.239 --> 5570.718999999999
design could achieve that because it's

5568.48 --> 5574.5599999999995
physically impossible

5570.719 --> 5578.08
light doesn't work like that

5574.56 --> 5579.679
they were all giant sons very very far

5578.08 --> 5581.199
away and

5579.679 --> 5583.92
whatever

5581.199 --> 5585.678999999999
yeah then we wouldn't see anything

5583.92 --> 5586.56
nothing

5585.679 --> 5590.08
or

5586.56 --> 5592.080000000001
everything would be universally lit up

5590.08 --> 5594.639
all day and night

5592.08 --> 5594.639
either way

5594.96 --> 5602.4800000000005
but you would not see light points

5598.719 --> 5604.96
that supposedly are just one beam over

5602.48 --> 5606.638999999999
the vast distance no that just doesn't

5604.96 --> 5608.8
work

5606.639 --> 5611.04
it doesn't work that can't work that can

5608.8 --> 5612.320000000001
never work not even in a perfect vacuum

5611.04 --> 5614.32
can that work

5612.32 --> 5615.84
because it will decrease in strength

5614.32 --> 5617.28
over distance no matter the

5615.84 --> 5618.96
circumstances

5617.28 --> 5621.92
and that kind of a distance doesn't

5618.96 --> 5625.92
matter how intense the light was

5621.92 --> 5629.159
it can't bridge that distance

5625.92 --> 5629.159
it can't

5644.96 --> 5647.96
um

5675.6 --> 5678.6
hmm

5693.6 --> 5697.52
being thing in the movie everyone looks

5695.52 --> 5699.4400000000005
for

5697.52 --> 5701.280000000001
but in reality and really in the

5699.44 --> 5703.5199999999995
audience

5701.28 --> 5703.5199999999995
well

5703.6 --> 5707.92
a good look adam pride this is about

5705.44 --> 5709.759999999999
movie making right the mcgovern a good

5707.92 --> 5711.84
macguffin

5709.76 --> 5714.639
is not spotted

5711.84 --> 5717.1990000000005
it's a good macguffin is a thing that's

5714.639 --> 5718.96
actually interesting like as a separate

5717.199 --> 5720.719
thing to the audience they're like oh i

5718.96 --> 5722.88
wouldn't know what that is

5720.719 --> 5725.679
right that's a good macguffin

5722.88 --> 5728.56
it but it really becomes a magoffin in

5725.679 --> 5731.52
the classical sense when it's obviously

5728.56 --> 5734.96
just a plot device

5731.52 --> 5736.8
that's stupid or kind of like oh there's

5734.96 --> 5739.92
it's like they didn't they weren't

5736.8 --> 5741.76
inspired about it and it's only there to

5739.92 --> 5744.4800000000005
carry forward

5741.76 --> 5746.719
the plot of the story and then it's

5744.48 --> 5749.119
really a mcguffin then it's like ugh

5746.719 --> 5751.28
that's so obviously a nonsense reason

5749.119 --> 5752.88
that's a mcguffin but a good mcguffin in

5751.28 --> 5757.759999999999
a movie

5752.88 --> 5759.4400000000005
is actually just an interesting item

5757.76 --> 5761.119000000001
and then you don't really know that it's

5759.44 --> 5762.719
a mcguffin you're like oh that's a

5761.119 --> 5764.799999999999
pretty cool thing

5762.719 --> 5766.32
to base a movie around right that's how

5764.8 --> 5768.08
you approach it then it's like oh that's

5766.32 --> 5770.48
a pretty cool thing to base a movie

5768.08 --> 5773.6
around

5770.48 --> 5778.28
cool not so cool whatever

5773.6 --> 5778.280000000001
but you won't see it as a macguffin

5784.4 --> 5788.5599999999995
you rather munch crayons than eat dirt

5786.719 --> 5791.119
do you jose

5788.56 --> 5791.119000000001
well yeah

5791.6 --> 5795.679
you're gonna need a lot of chalk

5793.84 --> 5799.6
so why not

5795.679 --> 5801.4400000000005
i actually eat chalk too

5799.6 --> 5803.679
in a way

5801.44 --> 5806.799999999999
i munch crayons

5803.679 --> 5809.04
with another supplement i got from my

5806.8 --> 5812.639
stepmother

5809.04 --> 5814.0
like this is pretty much calcium

5812.639 --> 5818.08
that's chalk

5814.0 --> 5819.199
but it also has vitamin d3 and uh k2 in

5818.08 --> 5821.5199999999995
it

5819.199 --> 5823.759999999999
it's bone complex but yeah this is

5821.52 --> 5826.320000000001
pretty much a crayon i could munch this

5823.76 --> 5829.679
right now but i already had one

5826.32 --> 5832.48
so in a way i am a crayon muncher

5829.679 --> 5836.52
and i eat dirt

5832.48 --> 5836.5199999999995
and it makes me very healthy

5850.719 --> 5855.679
thumbs

5853.119 --> 5857.44
it tums i don't know is tums is it chalk

5855.679 --> 5862.52
i don't know if that is the same thing

5857.44 --> 5862.5199999999995
though that has other ingredients in it

5894.96 --> 5898.96
if you don't follow the scientific

5897.119 --> 5900.48
movement you can prove it that's not

5898.96 --> 5902.8
true

5900.48 --> 5905.28
blue y 4j

5902.8 --> 5909.119000000001
you can still prove things you just

5905.28 --> 5911.679
can't claim science for it

5909.119 --> 5914.48
right that's really the bigger issue you

5911.679 --> 5917.6
can still prove things you can prove

5914.48 --> 5921.119
geometric aspects

5917.6 --> 5923.280000000001
you can prove numerical

5921.119 --> 5924.4
data you can measure things right

5923.28 --> 5926.96
measuring thing

5924.4 --> 5929.119
the thing is proving it like the

5926.96 --> 5931.52
measurement right you can still prove

5929.119 --> 5934.08
things you just can't really claim

5931.52 --> 5936.719
science for it

5934.08 --> 5939.84
you say oh this is scientific evidence

5936.719 --> 5939.84
then it's like oh really

5940.0 --> 5944.239
really what's your independent variable

5942.0 --> 5945.679
what did you as an experimenter vary and

5944.239 --> 5947.919999999999
manipulate

5945.679 --> 5950.0
in order to establish the cause of the

5947.92 --> 5951.6
effect which would be the scientific

5950.0 --> 5953.119
claim

5951.6 --> 5955.280000000001
right and then they're like what the

5953.119 --> 5956.719
[ __ ] are you talking about like yeah

5955.28 --> 5959.28
yeah that's because you're not a

5956.719 --> 5962.0
scientist you're a smurf

5959.28 --> 5964.8
and you think that if you just

5962.0 --> 5966.719
put the word science in front of

5964.8 --> 5969.04
everything that that's supposed to mean

5966.719 --> 5972.08
anything like a smurf does with the word

5969.04 --> 5975.04
smurf everything becomes smurf

5972.08 --> 5977.5199999999995
right but no as actual science is very

5975.04 --> 5979.6
specific

5977.52 --> 5981.84
very rigid

5979.6 --> 5985.119000000001
and empirical in nature you can't just

5981.84 --> 5985.119000000001
call everything science

5986.639 --> 5990.400000000001
if you do then you're not a scientist

5988.8 --> 5994.52
you're a smurf

5990.4 --> 5994.5199999999995
you just call everything smurf

5999.21 --> 6002.329
[Music]

6006.16 --> 6009.949
[Music]

6015.199 --> 6021.48
natural science and ordinary science

6018.48 --> 6021.48
what

6024.4 --> 6028.48
no

6025.76 --> 6030.96
no there is only natural science that's

6028.48 --> 6032.718999999999
the real science ordinary science is not

6030.96 --> 6034.84
science it's

6032.719 --> 6036.639
pseudoscience or rather

6034.84 --> 6039.92
colloquial

6036.639 --> 6041.679
cultural application of the word science

6039.92 --> 6044.639
in order to indicate

6041.679 --> 6046.56
just knowledge or lore

6044.639 --> 6048.4800000000005
right knowledge

6046.56 --> 6050.88
that's the word we're forgetting and

6048.48 --> 6052.718999999999
it's all called science oh i do science

6050.88 --> 6054.56
or you're just trying to understand

6052.719 --> 6056.4
things

6054.56 --> 6059.4400000000005
you don't do science science is very

6056.4 --> 6061.92
rigid it's a method trying to prove

6059.44 --> 6062.839999999999
as experimenter the cause of a naturally

6061.92 --> 6065.36
occurring

6062.84 --> 6067.679
phenomenon by varying and manipulating

6065.36 --> 6069.199
it that's science

6067.679 --> 6071.4400000000005
if you're doing something else you're

6069.199 --> 6073.36
just trying to figure things out

6071.44 --> 6074.879999999999
you're just trying to understand

6073.36 --> 6077.5199999999995
something

6074.88 --> 6080.400000000001
you're gathering knowledge

6077.52 --> 6080.400000000001
or lore

6080.88 --> 6084.0
the lore would be the bigger picture

6082.56 --> 6086.56
you're trying to build with the

6084.0 --> 6089.04
knowledge you're gathering

6086.56 --> 6091.52
right it's not science it's only signs

6089.04 --> 6094.08
when you apply the scientific method

6091.52 --> 6096.080000000001
and that's yeah that's kind of like

6094.08 --> 6098.48
the culture now it's now oh science

6096.08 --> 6099.44
everything is science oh you can

6098.48 --> 6102.0
dude

6099.44 --> 6105.04
look at this i'm doing science look at

6102.0 --> 6106.719
this science oh my god it's so science

6105.04 --> 6109.199
oh wow

6106.719 --> 6111.84
the cup is full that means science it's

6109.199 --> 6113.199
all science now yeah no it doesn't it's

6111.84 --> 6114.88
not science

6113.199 --> 6117.44
nothing about that is science you can

6114.88 --> 6119.679
think of it as science but it isn't

6117.44 --> 6122.08
it's more like smurf

6119.679 --> 6123.84
everything is smurf

6122.08 --> 6126.08
right that's why i've introduced that

6123.84 --> 6128.08
terminology now

6126.08 --> 6129.679
everybody that says oh it's all science

6128.08 --> 6132.159
everything you could do science yourself

6129.679 --> 6133.6
oh every kid can do science no that's

6132.159 --> 6135.92
smurf you're talking about you're

6133.6 --> 6138.400000000001
talking about smurfing

6135.92 --> 6140.4800000000005
the smurf this yeah

6138.4 --> 6142.799999999999
the smurf method

6140.48 --> 6145.28
it's not science it's smurf

6142.8 --> 6147.679
that's what you're doing

6145.28 --> 6150.239
yeah you're smurfing it just trying to

6147.679 --> 6152.719
smurf out the smurf

6150.239 --> 6155.718999999999
of how smurf works

6152.719 --> 6155.719
see

6164.41 --> 6167.5
[Music]

6174.88 --> 6180.159000000001
try to move that water horizontally so

6177.6 --> 6182.56
that it doesn't what

6180.159 --> 6186.759999999999
now i'll i'll just drink

6182.56 --> 6186.76
my tea thanks wrath

6193.679 --> 6195.92
right

6197.04 --> 6202.8
yeah blue y4j pseudoscience that is

6200.56 --> 6206.320000000001
technically correct it's just that

6202.8 --> 6209.119000000001
i don't think that pseudoscience is even

6206.32 --> 6211.44
even addresses the true nature of the

6209.119 --> 6213.28
problem anymore

6211.44 --> 6214.48
because it still has the word science in

6213.28 --> 6217.119
it and it has

6214.48 --> 6219.919999999999
like what is being done today with this

6217.119 --> 6222.4
cultural smurf revolution

6219.92 --> 6224.56
is so far away from the scientific

6222.4 --> 6227.44
method and what it's supposed to be

6224.56 --> 6230.320000000001
to even call it pseudoscience is almost

6227.44 --> 6231.5199999999995
still an insult to the word science

6230.32 --> 6234.08
it's still

6231.52 --> 6236.56
kind of wrong it's because

6234.08 --> 6240.0
the word pseudoscience is outdated

6236.56 --> 6241.830000000001
because it underestimated how far

6240.0 --> 6243.199
this crazy fad

6241.83 --> 6245.5199999999995
[Music]

6243.199 --> 6247.44
with calling everything signs would go

6245.52 --> 6249.52
it underestimated the word

6247.44 --> 6253.839999999999
underestimates how

6249.52 --> 6256.159000000001
insane people are dealing with it

6253.84 --> 6258.719
so i kind of just want to remove the

6256.159 --> 6261.36
word science and just call it smurf

6258.719 --> 6264.96
they're just trying to smurf it

6261.36 --> 6267.28
right because then you feel

6264.96 --> 6270.2390000000005
when you say the word swear if you feel

6267.28 --> 6272.159
what it is they're actually doing there

6270.239 --> 6274.5599999999995
because it is like what the smurfs are

6272.159 --> 6277.44
doing calling everything smurf it's all

6274.56 --> 6279.92
smurf you just smurf it right and it

6277.44 --> 6281.919999999999
works to them it works to the smurfs and

6279.92 --> 6284.2390000000005
it works to these people that say

6281.92 --> 6285.92
everything is science

6284.239 --> 6289.839999999999
although they will still say science

6285.92 --> 6289.84
doesn't prove anything which is

6290.159 --> 6294.799999999999
totally totally mental really to go

6293.36 --> 6297.04
there

6294.8 --> 6297.04
right

6297.44 --> 6301.839999999999
that's like smurfs talking all the all

6299.679 --> 6303.36
day long about smurfing it and we gotta

6301.84 --> 6306.2390000000005
smurf the smurf

6303.36 --> 6308.639
but then when you inquire yeah sorry i'm

6306.239 --> 6311.04
sorry but smurf doesn't actually prove

6308.639 --> 6311.04
anything

6311.76 --> 6315.4400000000005
what

6312.96 --> 6318.84
the [ __ ]

6315.44 --> 6318.839999999999
it's nuts

6331.199 --> 6335.719
your phone doesn't like the word smurf

6348.48 --> 6352.879999999999
yeah well that's the thing about smurf

6350.48 --> 6355.36
right it can mean anything

6352.88 --> 6357.76
that's the whole point

6355.36 --> 6360.32
that's why it's so suitable to compare

6357.76 --> 6362.96
it with how science is used these days

6360.32 --> 6362.96
in culture

6364.159 --> 6367.04
pseudosmurf

6368.48 --> 6372.879999999999
can you imagine that there is like the

6370.56 --> 6374.719
ancient original smurf i think there

6372.88 --> 6377.119
actually was one of those in some

6374.719 --> 6379.76
episode like an ancient original smurf

6377.119 --> 6379.759999999999
and it's like

6380.32 --> 6386.4
no you don't understand the word smurf

6383.92 --> 6388.8
it's all about the smurfing method is a

6386.4 --> 6390.719
very rigid thing you can't just go about

6388.8 --> 6394.08
calling everything smurf and then the

6390.719 --> 6394.08
smurfs are like what

6394.639 --> 6400.159000000001
we can't call everything smurf like what

6397.04 --> 6402.88
are you talking about old smurf

6400.159 --> 6404.96
like no we're not even smurfs i don't

6402.88 --> 6406.400000000001
know why you call it smurf why are you

6404.96 --> 6408.56
calling us the smurfs well because we

6406.4 --> 6413.5599999999995
called everything a smurf but you don't

6408.56 --> 6413.56
understand what the smurf really was

6426.0 --> 6430.0
that would be actually kind of funny

6427.6 --> 6432.56
though if there it really is like an

6430.0 --> 6434.88
ancient smurf with a huge gray beard or

6432.56 --> 6434.88
something

6435.52 --> 6439.679
in the smurfs

6437.52 --> 6441.679
that you could make a sketch like that

6439.679 --> 6444.08
like how i described

6441.679 --> 6446.639
like no you don't understand this you're

6444.08 --> 6449.6
misapplying the word smurf we're not

6446.639 --> 6451.92
actually smurfs why you keep calling

6449.6 --> 6454.08
everything smurf yeah because why

6451.92 --> 6456.56
wouldn't we we call everything smurf why

6454.08 --> 6460.639
wouldn't we we are the smurfs it would

6456.56 --> 6460.639
it didn't used to be like that

6460.88 --> 6466.400000000001
how society has dilapidated calling

6463.76 --> 6469.400000000001
everything smurf

6466.4 --> 6469.4
right

6495.76 --> 6501.4400000000005
don't decide what science is

6499.28 --> 6504.719
no you're projecting their little trolly

6501.44 --> 6508.48
boy grundle blast

6504.719 --> 6510.4800000000005
oh that's a hundred percent 180 degrees

6508.48 --> 6514.638999999999
projection

6510.48 --> 6516.4
perfect perfect satanic projection

6514.639 --> 6520.159000000001
really dumb though like that's not even

6516.4 --> 6520.159
going to work on anybody but yourself

6521.119 --> 6525.04
right but that's what they do the

6522.639 --> 6528.2390000000005
reversed rollers in the end always end

6525.04 --> 6529.92
up just gaslighting themselves

6528.239 --> 6532.08
they are the ones they are trying to

6529.92 --> 6535.84
convince not everybody else because

6532.08 --> 6538.0
everybody else can just easily

6535.84 --> 6541.04
see what they say for what it is a

6538.0 --> 6544.719
perfect projection

6541.04 --> 6545.76
their own issues they have they project

6544.719 --> 6548.88
onto

6545.76 --> 6551.679
their target they accuse you and

6548.88 --> 6553.4400000000005
everybody else they oppose of what they

6551.679 --> 6556.32
exactly do

6553.44 --> 6556.32
in that moment

6556.719 --> 6558.96
right

6559.199 --> 6563.28
you have to be an absolute [ __ ] or

6561.52 --> 6565.679
completely

6563.28 --> 6567.5199999999995
uninformed to actually believe what

6565.679 --> 6570.32
they're saying in such a moment you have

6567.52 --> 6573.119000000001
to not pay attention

6570.32 --> 6575.28
to actually think that there's any

6573.119 --> 6576.799999999999
value in what they're saying because if

6575.28 --> 6579.44
you don't if you actually know what's

6576.8 --> 6581.4400000000005
going on what's being talked about

6579.44 --> 6585.119
then you're just gonna see it exactly

6581.44 --> 6588.0
for what it is a pathetic attempt at

6585.119 --> 6590.88
perfect projection they accuse

6588.0 --> 6592.239
the ones informed of doing

6590.88 --> 6594.2390000000005
what they do

6592.239 --> 6597.839999999999
not being informed

6594.239 --> 6597.839999999999
reversing everything around

6600.96 --> 6606.84
hello cold spring queen

6603.599 --> 6606.84
good morning

6613.84 --> 6617.719
oh

6614.719 --> 6617.719
hmm

6673.92 --> 6676.92
right

6703.44 --> 6709.598999999999
every point on the sphere is level no

6707.52 --> 6712.88
no it's not

6709.599 --> 6715.119000000001
there is no point level

6712.88 --> 6717.52
right you might think

6715.119 --> 6720.08
that every straight line

6717.52 --> 6721.360000000001
can touch a ball and that it's all like

6720.08 --> 6724.48
no but

6721.36 --> 6726.719
there is no level

6724.48 --> 6729.36
it's all curved every part of it is

6726.719 --> 6730.4
curved there is no perfect straight

6729.36 --> 6731.839999999999
surface

6730.4 --> 6733.598999999999
on the ball

6731.84 --> 6736.599
yet there are straight surfaces

6733.599 --> 6736.599
everywhere

6737.36 --> 6744.48
large

6738.639 --> 6744.4800000000005
large surfaces of very very flat land

6745.44 --> 6750.598999999999
and ocean bottom

6747.04 --> 6750.599
it's all flat

6761.04 --> 6764.88
that's the definition of sphere all the

6763.199 --> 6766.4
points that are equidistant to the

6764.88 --> 6769.119
center

6766.4 --> 6771.598999999999
yeah that's what it's supposed to be yet

6769.119 --> 6774.32
that doesn't actually exist

6771.599 --> 6777.76
here on earth though

6774.32 --> 6780.32
none of it is curved it's all flat

6777.76 --> 6780.320000000001
all of it

6786.8 --> 6793.8
i think we find the smurf yeah could

6788.48 --> 6793.799999999999
very well be jeff gassett we'll see

6806.639 --> 6809.639
uh

6862.0 --> 6868.32
i don't even have to get to that anymore

6864.32 --> 6872.84
the r value the poor r value

6868.32 --> 6872.84
that they don't have and they never will

6876.719 --> 6880.0
whoa

6877.599 --> 6883.719
did you put together there

6880.0 --> 6883.719
getting wisdom hello

6898.4 --> 6901.04
thank you for that

6902.88 --> 6905.84
okay

6935.28 --> 6938.239
right i think i'm gonna

6938.56 --> 6943.52
round out the show soon

6940.96 --> 6946.8
been going for almost two hours

6943.52 --> 6950.719
and i'm getting really hungry and

6946.8 --> 6952.320000000001
i could probably go on if i'd eaten

6950.719 --> 6954.32
but

6952.32 --> 6957.32
i can also just try to save it up for

6954.32 --> 6957.32
tomorrow

6973.119 --> 6975.839999999999
uh

6976.32 --> 6982.719
r is 60 nautical miles is it

6980.08 --> 6984.719
how did you measure that

6982.719 --> 6987.719
devil's certificate how did you measure

6984.719 --> 6987.719
that

6994.639 --> 7000.2390000000005
and we like to go through this

6996.719 --> 7000.2390000000005
for a go why not

7001.36 --> 7005.28
i mean on the flat earth debate it's

7002.8 --> 7006.639
always the guys that take on that right

7005.28 --> 7008.639
i

7006.639 --> 7010.88
these days i don't even really take the

7008.639 --> 7012.56
effort anymore to

7010.88 --> 7017.639
take a baller through that is because

7012.56 --> 7017.639
it's so absurd that they don't know this

7018.4 --> 7023.28
the definition of radius yeah but how

7020.96 --> 7025.76
did you measure it though

7023.28 --> 7027.44
yeah we know you can define a radius

7025.76 --> 7031.56
that's super cute

7027.44 --> 7031.5599999999995
how did you measure it though

7033.679 --> 7036.4
here on earth

7036.48 --> 7040.119
how did you do that

7049.199 --> 7053.759999999999
nautical miles from

7051.52 --> 7053.76
what

7054.8 --> 7060.159000000001
per degree now but how did you measure

7057.28 --> 7062.639
that that's a description

7060.159 --> 7065.44
that's a description of how much it

7062.639 --> 7065.4400000000005
needs to be

7065.599 --> 7068.88
curved like that's a geometric

7067.199 --> 7070.96
description basically what you're saying

7068.88 --> 7073.04
now devil's that forget but that's not

7070.96 --> 7074.96
my question i didn't ask you to

7073.04 --> 7076.4
calculate it

7074.96 --> 7077.52
i asked you

7076.4 --> 7079.5199999999995
how did you

7077.52 --> 7084.080000000001
measure it

7079.52 --> 7084.080000000001
measuring not calculate measure

7084.4 --> 7090.48
how did you actually establish

7087.599 --> 7094.1990000000005
that it is curved

7090.48 --> 7094.199
how did you do that

7119.679 --> 7124.719
oh my god

7122.0 --> 7127.119
measure the distance between degrees you

7124.719 --> 7130.32
mean the degrees that you don't actually

7127.119 --> 7133.199
measure but you presuppose

7130.32 --> 7135.599
you presuppose that there are degrees

7133.199 --> 7138.48
over distance and then you measure the

7135.599 --> 7141.1990000000005
radius based on that presupposition that

7138.48 --> 7143.44
you didn't measure no

7141.199 --> 7146.159
that's not how you measure the radius

7143.44 --> 7149.28
you don't just say oh i

7146.159 --> 7152.799999999999
i went this far

7149.28 --> 7154.5599999999995
and then say this is how much it should

7152.8 --> 7156.08
be

7154.56 --> 7157.320000000001
over the curve

7156.08 --> 7160.159
no that's

7157.32 --> 7162.719
calculating it's just assuming you are

7160.159 --> 7165.119
going over a curve over a distance and

7162.719 --> 7167.84
then saying oh that's how we then

7165.119 --> 7170.08
measure the radius no that's calculation

7167.84 --> 7171.599
it's presuppositional based calculation

7170.08 --> 7173.679
it's not measurement how did you

7171.599 --> 7176.88
actually measure it

7173.679 --> 7179.119
how do you actually know

7176.88 --> 7180.96
that the earth is supposedly a ball how

7179.119 --> 7183.598999999999
do you know it you do it through

7180.96 --> 7186.4
measurement right that's field based

7183.599 --> 7189.719
confirmation so where is yours how did

7186.4 --> 7189.719
you do that

7201.679 --> 7205.52
measuring the changes in angles to

7203.599 --> 7207.679
distant objects oh so you're just going

7205.52 --> 7210.0
to presuppose that they're objects at a

7207.679 --> 7212.32
distance then

7210.0 --> 7214.719
what's your evidence for that you don't

7212.32 --> 7216.239
have evidence that they are objects at

7214.719 --> 7217.44
that distance

7216.239 --> 7220.5599999999995
and that they're

7217.44 --> 7225.04
changing their visible angle towards you

7220.56 --> 7227.1990000000005
as an observer because you move over

7225.04 --> 7229.44
a sphere you don't have evidence for

7227.199 --> 7229.44
that

7229.76 --> 7233.92
you don't know what those lights are

7232.239 --> 7237.119
you think you know what they are but you

7233.92 --> 7240.4800000000005
don't have evidence for that

7237.119 --> 7242.32
right you didn't measure anything

7240.48 --> 7244.799999999999
you haven't measured a single thing you

7242.32 --> 7247.04
have not said how you measured a single

7244.8 --> 7247.04
thing

7248.96 --> 7252.2390000000005
oh don't care if they're objects only if

7250.8 --> 7254.639
they're very far away yeah well you

7252.239 --> 7258.08
don't have evidence for that either

7254.639 --> 7258.08
what do you mean evidence

7260.48 --> 7265.119
that they are very you only care for

7262.96 --> 7267.52
your presuppositional assumptions that

7265.119 --> 7269.679
they are very far away well that's super

7267.52 --> 7272.320000000001
cute that's not evidence though you

7269.679 --> 7276.0
didn't actually measure

7272.32 --> 7278.639
earth curve or the radius

7276.0 --> 7280.239
by doing what you've described so how

7278.639 --> 7282.96
did you measure it

7280.239 --> 7285.119
how do you know the earth is a ball

7282.96 --> 7287.32
curved

7285.119 --> 7289.92
not through calculations or

7287.32 --> 7293.36
presuppositional based

7289.92 --> 7294.159
derived conclusions how did you measure

7293.36 --> 7297.799999999999
it

7294.159 --> 7297.799999999999
to be spherical

7327.44 --> 7332.0
oh my god you don't know what

7328.96 --> 7334.4
measurement do you have eyes devil

7332.0 --> 7335.679
do you actually have eyes

7334.4 --> 7338.5599999999995
and hands

7335.679 --> 7340.56
do you even know how things

7338.56 --> 7343.04
doing things works

7340.56 --> 7345.52
do you know how to do things

7343.04 --> 7348.32
right measuring things in the world how

7345.52 --> 7351.280000000001
you know how to do things or you you

7348.32 --> 7353.44
just a living calculator are you a bot

7351.28 --> 7355.759999999999
are you just a pre-programmed bot that

7353.44 --> 7358.0
doesn't even know what measuring things

7355.76 --> 7358.0
is

7360.239 --> 7364.159
because you're just repeating the same

7362.159 --> 7366.799999999999
[ __ ] over and over again

7364.159 --> 7368.879999999999
it's like oh this is how we calculate it

7366.8 --> 7371.360000000001
based on presuppositions that you

7368.88 --> 7373.119
haven't proven you haven't given me

7371.36 --> 7374.4
physical measured proof

7373.119 --> 7376.96
for radius

7374.4 --> 7378.719
curvature or anything you just

7376.96 --> 7380.88
presuppose

7378.719 --> 7382.56
the outcome

7380.88 --> 7386.0
that's what you've done that's all

7382.56 --> 7386.0
you've done you've done nothing

7387.44 --> 7390.719
so

7388.4 --> 7392.159
are you going to actually provide me

7390.719 --> 7395.679
with

7392.159 --> 7398.799999999999
evidence or hearsay whatever how you

7395.679 --> 7401.119
measured the radius of earth

7398.8 --> 7403.4400000000005
or you're just going to keep on

7401.119 --> 7406.839999999999
pumping out the same presuppositional

7403.44 --> 7406.839999999999
based calculations

7420.239 --> 7426.718999999999
no no they don't professor phil bell the

7422.88 --> 7429.28
stars are not in literal positions

7426.719 --> 7430.719
they're holographic they are not in

7429.28 --> 7432.0
positions

7430.719 --> 7435.199
they're only

7432.0 --> 7437.199
displaying themselves in angular fashion

7435.199 --> 7440.0
in relation to the observer as a

7437.199 --> 7442.239
holographic phenomena that cannot be

7440.0 --> 7445.84
traced to any position

7442.239 --> 7448.879999999999
in space anywhere they do not exist as

7445.84 --> 7452.719
objects they are an angular

7448.88 --> 7454.4800000000005
celestial holographic phenomenon that's

7452.719 --> 7456.56
all they are and that includes the

7454.48 --> 7457.598999999999
entire sun and all the light that comes

7456.56 --> 7461.119000000001
from it

7457.599 --> 7463.679
yeah including that all of it

7461.119 --> 7466.4
they don't have positions they only have

7463.679 --> 7468.88
angular apparent positions

7466.4 --> 7470.4
in relation to the observer you can

7468.88 --> 7473.4400000000005
think

7470.4 --> 7476.0
that that light comes from a object

7473.44 --> 7477.759999999999
that's hanging somewhere

7476.0 --> 7479.679
or straw man us with the flat earth

7477.76 --> 7482.56
models oh no it's it's

7479.679 --> 7484.4800000000005
they're all hanging there oh why don't

7482.56 --> 7487.280000000001
we see them go away through perspective

7484.48 --> 7489.678999999999
yeah because they're not objects

7487.28 --> 7490.5599999999995
and perspective do does not apply to

7489.679 --> 7492.4800000000005
them

7490.56 --> 7495.4400000000005
the only thing you get to see is an

7492.48 --> 7496.959999999999
angular manifestation in relation to you

7495.44 --> 7500.079
the observer

7496.96 --> 7501.92
and your position

7500.079 --> 7505.48
they're not objects you don't have

7501.92 --> 7505.4800000000005
evidence for that

7506.159 --> 7508.48
right

7511.679 --> 7518.84
you see it as a sphere the stars

7516.4 --> 7521.5199999999995
you see them as a

7518.84 --> 7524.8
sphere or a demisphere because you can

7521.52 --> 7528.96
only only ever see half of it the other

7524.8 --> 7532.639
half is not visible at any time

7528.96 --> 7535.199
you only see the holographic sphere

7532.639 --> 7538.4800000000005
half of it demisphere that's why i call

7535.199 --> 7540.4
it a demisphere the celestial demisphere

7538.48 --> 7543.5199999999995
right and you can map that

7540.4 --> 7546.239
but you can never map it in any sort of

7543.52 --> 7547.52
way beyond just a

7546.239 --> 7551.199
sphere

7547.52 --> 7552.2390000000005
that appears to surround the observer on

7551.199 --> 7553.839999999999
earth

7552.239 --> 7555.919999999999
that's the only way you can ever

7553.84 --> 7559.1990000000005
represent it because that's the only

7555.92 --> 7561.28
data that you have about it

7559.199 --> 7564.4
there is no other data because you

7561.28 --> 7567.119
cannot pinpoint anything about that

7564.4 --> 7569.598999999999
about them location-wise ever

7567.119 --> 7571.44
you can pre-assume a lot of things and

7569.599 --> 7573.1990000000005
then calculate based on those

7571.44 --> 7574.799999999999
presuppositions

7573.199 --> 7577.119
those presumptions

7574.8 --> 7578.119000000001
but you don't have that data that's all

7577.119 --> 7580.32
pure

7578.119 --> 7582.639
presuppositional based speculation you

7580.32 --> 7585.28
don't have evidence for any of that yeah

7582.639 --> 7587.599
you can make a lot of cgi

7585.28 --> 7590.159
to play into that system

7587.599 --> 7593.119000000001
there's no proof there's more

7590.159 --> 7593.119
pre-assumptions

7593.199 --> 7599.0
the only thing you have

7594.8 --> 7599.0
is angular data

7605.679 --> 7609.1990000000005
hey daniel field good to see you

7611.199 --> 7617.199
fortunately i don't need to know any of

7613.52 --> 7620.56
those details [ __ ] you dude

7617.199 --> 7621.839999999999
don't tell me what i need to know

7620.56 --> 7623.360000000001
or you think you're some kind of a

7621.84 --> 7627.360000000001
gatekeeper it's good thing that you

7623.36 --> 7628.799999999999
don't have any information to gatekeep

7627.36 --> 7631.04
because you're

7628.8 --> 7633.1990000000005
blatantly ignorant

7631.04 --> 7634.48
haven't responded to anything i've

7633.199 --> 7638.4
addressed

7634.48 --> 7638.4
your claims with at all

7639.199 --> 7644.5599999999995
yeah don't don't freaking tell me what i

7642.159 --> 7647.679
need and don't need to know

7644.56 --> 7649.84
yeah i need to [ __ ] know

7647.679 --> 7651.4400000000005
yeah i'm not gonna go with your stupid

7649.84 --> 7654.079
presuppositional

7651.44 --> 7654.079
[ __ ]

7654.48 --> 7660.799999999999
i'm not gonna be part of your religious

7657.04 --> 7663.44
zealotry i am going to actually inquire

7660.8 --> 7666.2390000000005
on measurements as proof

7663.44 --> 7669.199
and not assume your presuppositional

7666.239 --> 7670.638999999999
[ __ ] to be true and self-evident

7669.199 --> 7673.678999999999
which it isn't

7670.639 --> 7676.159000000001
because you can't provide any evidence

7673.679 --> 7678.2390000000005
can only presuppose and calculate

7676.159 --> 7681.239
because you're a numpty you don't know

7678.239 --> 7681.239
anything

7688.56 --> 7695.400000000001
yeah well then i'm

7690.4 --> 7695.4
obliged to ban you bye

7709.66 --> 7713.92
[Music]

7711.52 --> 7715.76
we have the evidence but i don't have to

7713.92 --> 7718.079
share it with you yeah

7715.76 --> 7721.52
i'm sure sure

7718.079 --> 7721.5199999999995
yeah get the [ __ ] out

7725.599 --> 7730.92
you're a liar and a terrible one at it

7751.44 --> 7756.32
see it's all the same it's

7753.599 --> 7758.96
so pathetic

7756.32 --> 7761.199
ball religion is a culture of

7758.96 --> 7763.599
presupposition of presupposition they

7761.199 --> 7764.799999999999
don't measure anything

7763.599 --> 7768.96
they look

7764.8 --> 7771.04
at the holographic celestial demisphere

7768.96 --> 7773.679
and then they just oh look oh it's that

7771.04 --> 7774.96
many degrees and it has to be a ball

7773.679 --> 7777.92
underneath it

7774.96 --> 7779.199
it has to be a ball underneath that

7777.92 --> 7781.28
[Music]

7779.199 --> 7783.119
we don't have to give you the evidence i

7781.28 --> 7786.4
don't have to give you a measurement i'm

7783.119 --> 7788.239
just going to go with that calculation

7786.4 --> 7789.92
because it's always the same and this is

7788.239 --> 7792.718999999999
what we do

7789.92 --> 7794.159
yeah you're retards

7792.719 --> 7796.079
you derive

7794.159 --> 7798.48
your information

7796.079 --> 7800.639
from celestial angles and you don't

7798.48 --> 7803.28
prove anything you only calculate it

7800.639 --> 7806.32
based on some stupid presuppositional

7803.28 --> 7807.599
angle game and you're a [ __ ] if you go

7806.32 --> 7810.4
with that and you think that that's

7807.599 --> 7814.56
proof of a ball earth it isn't is no

7810.4 --> 7817.598999999999
proof whatsoever you're just a numpty

7814.56 --> 7820.320000000001
a religious zealot [ __ ]

7817.599 --> 7823.119000000001
that believes in calculation

7820.32 --> 7824.32
and believes in withholding evidence

7823.119 --> 7826.88
from me

7824.32 --> 7828.639
from yourself

7826.88 --> 7829.84
yeah and then you think you have

7828.639 --> 7832.4800000000005
evidence you think you have some

7829.84 --> 7834.56
intellectual authority

7832.48 --> 7836.638999999999
for not

7834.56 --> 7838.96
doing things and just

7836.639 --> 7841.1990000000005
assuming they are the way they are in

7838.96 --> 7845.0
your mind

7841.199 --> 7845.0
you're a religious salad

7870.159 --> 7876.239
hey service day

7873.52 --> 7876.2390000000005
welcome back

7878.56 --> 7881.56
gross

7899.28 --> 7903.079
no problem what

7918.8 --> 7922.320000000001
oh okay

7920.0 --> 7922.32
thanks

7924.96 --> 7932.28
but yeah please don't talk about

7927.199 --> 7932.28
freaking condoms and [ __ ] that's gross

7960.159 --> 7965.04
damn trolls well in this case it's

7962.96 --> 7966.4
it's really ballers like they're just

7965.04 --> 7967.36
ballers

7966.4 --> 7969.839999999999
they're

7967.36 --> 7972.639
well anti-flat earthers but not even all

7969.84 --> 7974.079
anti-flat earthers are trolls you know

7972.639 --> 7976.400000000001
i mean

7974.079 --> 7978.88
when you push them they can become

7976.4 --> 7980.799999999999
trollish but yeah so can flat earthers

7978.88 --> 7982.32
but they're not all part definition

7980.8 --> 7984.0
trolls

7982.32 --> 7986.5599999999995
there are some people that are by

7984.0 --> 7988.96
definition trolls that are just trying

7986.56 --> 7991.119000000001
to be nasty every step of the way those

7988.96 --> 7994.0
are the real trolls

7991.119 --> 7998.799999999999
right but there's actually plenty of

7994.0 --> 8002.0
really idiotic ball believers

7998.8 --> 8003.679
that'll sidestep any logic to maintain

8002.0 --> 8005.76
their belief

8003.679 --> 8010.92
those are not really trolls they're just

8005.76 --> 8010.92
kind of desperate deluded people

8014.48 --> 8017.5199999999995
right

8015.52 --> 8018.8
but you can think of them as trolls

8017.52 --> 8023.320000000001
because that's

8018.8 --> 8023.320000000001
what they usually end up like

8026.88 --> 8030.56
if they are like really can't let go

8028.88 --> 8032.96
despite everything they've learned in

8030.56 --> 8035.1990000000005
the meantime

8032.96 --> 8037.44
and then they turn into trolling because

8035.199 --> 8039.678999999999
they're just trying to push out feeling

8037.44 --> 8041.839999999999
so they don't have to let it sink in

8039.679 --> 8043.599
that they're absolutely wrong about

8041.84 --> 8046.639
everything they believed

8043.599 --> 8048.639
and that they've doubled down

8046.639 --> 8051.679
far beyond what they should have in

8048.639 --> 8054.56
order to reinforce that belief

8051.679 --> 8057.119
that they've sacrificed

8054.56 --> 8060.320000000001
to insane degrees

8057.119 --> 8062.159
to that belief that was wrong

8060.32 --> 8065.04
they can't handle that and then they

8062.159 --> 8067.119
just push forward nasty feelings start

8065.04 --> 8069.36
projecting start turning into reversed

8067.119 --> 8071.92
royal tacticians

8069.36 --> 8073.88
to project their [ __ ] so they don't have

8071.92 --> 8077.119
to feel how they were

8073.88 --> 8079.599
monumentally wrong about so many things

8077.119 --> 8081.5199999999995
and that they've sacrificed effectively

8079.599 --> 8084.32
to the devil

8081.52 --> 8086.639
by doubling down on being absolutely

8084.32 --> 8086.639
wrong

8090.639 --> 8094.639
that's a sensation that most people

8092.48 --> 8097.199
don't really want to feel it feels

8094.639 --> 8098.96
terrible so they then

8097.199 --> 8101.839999999999
shout it off

8098.96 --> 8105.119
they project that [ __ ] onto the others

8101.84 --> 8107.04
to the ones they're attacking

8105.119 --> 8109.679
so they don't have to feel like that

8107.04 --> 8112.32
they can just imagine how what they feel

8109.679 --> 8113.36
like is the other person they basically

8112.32 --> 8117.28
try to

8113.36 --> 8118.88
to steal the calm and peace of mind from

8117.28 --> 8121.599
their target and

8118.88 --> 8124.400000000001
and project their [ __ ] so that they can

8121.599 --> 8127.28
take that piece that the other guy has

8124.4 --> 8129.199
that they want and then they can think

8127.28 --> 8131.5199999999995
it's in internal process they think they

8129.199 --> 8132.96
could just put that [ __ ] that they have

8131.52 --> 8135.92
that they feel

8132.96 --> 8137.92
put that on the target and then rob them

8135.92 --> 8139.84
of their peace and calm of mind so that

8137.92 --> 8140.88
they can have it that's the magical

8139.84 --> 8143.28
thinking

8140.88 --> 8145.36
that happens internally

8143.28 --> 8147.28
that's what they do

8145.36 --> 8149.5199999999995
it doesn't make any logical sense it

8147.28 --> 8152.48
doesn't actually roll out like that but

8149.52 --> 8154.88
that's what it feels like

8152.48 --> 8157.598999999999
to people that go there

8154.88 --> 8160.599
with reversed world projecting

8157.599 --> 8160.599
accusations

8166.159 --> 8169.759999999999
you just do your thing i know nothing

8167.679 --> 8172.4800000000005
about the lights in the sky well i

8169.76 --> 8172.4800000000005
that's fine

8173.76 --> 8178.400000000001
i don't have to be there to have data on

8176.32 --> 8181.04
it i do have data and the data is all

8178.4 --> 8183.679
angular and the data is

8181.04 --> 8185.119
light apparition based

8183.679 --> 8187.84
and that's

8185.119 --> 8190.96
well enough data for me to start

8187.84 --> 8192.8
laying groundworks frameworks for their

8190.96 --> 8194.0
interpretation

8192.8 --> 8196.479
and my

8194.0 --> 8200.399
conclusion has led me to they are

8196.479 --> 8203.358999999999
holographic phenomena

8200.399 --> 8205.358999999999
light-based apparitions that do not have

8203.359 --> 8208.16
a position

8205.359 --> 8210.0
every time you try to inquire on a

8208.16 --> 8211.519
specific position of any of the

8210.0 --> 8214.0
celestial lights

8211.519 --> 8215.2
they always elude you

8214.0 --> 8218.639
always

8215.2 --> 8221.2
you move towards them they move away

8218.639 --> 8223.759999999998
they don't stay in that position and

8221.2 --> 8225.12
then they increase in angular size

8223.76 --> 8227.679
because they're not objects you're

8225.12 --> 8229.12
approaching they're light apparitions

8227.679 --> 8232.960000000001
holograms

8229.12 --> 8235.28
they're not actually in any spot

8232.96 --> 8238.0
they only have angular manifestations

8235.28 --> 8240.719000000001
that's the data that is there and the

8238.0 --> 8241.679
word holographic

8240.719 --> 8244.16
is

8241.679 --> 8248.599
the description that i give it

8244.16 --> 8248.599
based on the data that i have

8249.92 --> 8253.76
right

8251.92 --> 8255.679
but i am going to run out the show now

8253.76 --> 8258.0
because i really want to get some lunch

8255.679 --> 8259.12
