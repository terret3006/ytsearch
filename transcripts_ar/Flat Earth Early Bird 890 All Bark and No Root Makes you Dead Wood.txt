proper ones

101.6 --> 103.83999999999999
so

104.64 --> 110.32
whether today is the very very damp

111.119 --> 114.72
did get up a little earlier than

112.88 --> 117.19999999999999
yesterday well yeah because i'm not an

114.72 --> 117.2
hour late

117.52 --> 120.88
and didn't go for groceries got a little

119.439 --> 124.32
wet

120.88 --> 127.03999999999999
and it's just yeah the the met the

124.32 --> 128.79999999999998
the water it doesn't seem to be

127.04 --> 132.239
dissolving much further

128.8 --> 135.92000000000002
i think the air is pretty much saturated

132.239 --> 140.08
it's moist right now so it's really just

135.92 --> 144.0
sticky but it is also warm

140.08 --> 147.20000000000002
so it's it's kind of tropical

144.0 --> 150.16
in a way despite the overall

147.2 --> 150.16
lack of sun

154.84 --> 157.84
right

159.84 --> 170.31900000000002
so it's tuesday the 11th

164.72 --> 172.72
of may 2021

170.319 --> 175.11999999999998
seeking star wars first in chat good to

172.72 --> 175.12
see you

178.56 --> 186.08
so yesterday i it was a late night

182.72 --> 191.04
it was very late i stayed up until

186.08 --> 193.76000000000002
basically the morning

191.04 --> 194.959
light started to arrive and like a whole

193.76 --> 198.72
spectacle

194.959 --> 201.44
of birds out there

198.72 --> 203.84
was pretty impressive but yeah i'm gonna

201.44 --> 204.72
really try to not go to bed so late

203.84 --> 208.08
anymore

204.72 --> 208.48
it's not too too healthy though yeah i

208.08 --> 213.84
did

208.48 --> 213.84
sleep plenty

214.4 --> 219.36
hello come me cameron kamikaze gilmore

221.28 --> 223.68
all right

224.319 --> 229.76
yeah but yeah i did stay up like

226.56 --> 229.76
watching movies again

234.64 --> 241.83999999999997
all right let me recall what i was doing

253.439 --> 255.84
uh

256.639 --> 260.959
right well yesterday's flutters dirty

258.88 --> 265.12
bird despite being short was pretty

260.959 --> 268.479
pretty good didn't watch it back but

265.12 --> 270.08
yeah it was okay uh flat earth debates

268.479 --> 275.03999999999996
were very interesting

270.08 --> 275.03999999999996
had a bit of a confrontation

275.199 --> 279.44
in the after show at the near the end it

277.52 --> 282.479
was a very long after show by the way

279.44 --> 284.32
like over an hour long

282.479 --> 286.56
so that should be interesting watching

284.32 --> 286.56
back

288.16 --> 291.6
but yeah i did a little confrontation

290.08 --> 297.84
about the overall

291.6 --> 300.639
tendency to rumpus

297.84 --> 301.11999999999995
and well yeah will you see it back

300.639 --> 304.16
anyway

301.12 --> 307.68
it was a pretty good flat earth debates

304.16 --> 311.12
uh also oh benjamin went

307.68 --> 313.68
live on youtube like

311.12 --> 316.4
he actually started now streaming with

313.68 --> 318.56
the barry and larry account the new one

316.4 --> 320.56
and there was even a live youtube chat

318.56 --> 323.199
so that was very

320.56 --> 325.199
exhilarating basically getting back in

323.199 --> 328.96000000000004
the youtube chat being active there

325.199 --> 328.96000000000004
so that was very nice

329.52 --> 333.19899999999996
even though like own benjamin didn't

331.52 --> 335.039
follow that chat

333.199 --> 336.8
it was really great hang around with

335.039 --> 339.84
bears the bears

336.8 --> 339.84000000000003
in there

340.72 --> 343.68
and doing my thing

344.56 --> 350.16
that i used to do when home benjamin was

347.12 --> 350.16
still going live on d

350.84 --> 356.96
live

352.56 --> 356.96
uh let's see

358.16 --> 368.639
what else

366.4 --> 368.63899999999995
uh

373.68 --> 376.24
oh yeah

378.0 --> 382.479
yeah i hung around a little at brandon's

380.96 --> 385.52
in the chat

382.479 --> 386.639
didn't really yeah didn't get on the

385.52 --> 389.19899999999996
show didn't feel like it

386.639 --> 389.199
would yeah

391.36 --> 398.0
that's pretty much it after that i

394.4 --> 400.88
started diving on netflix to see what

398.0 --> 400.88
was up in there

403.84 --> 412.71999999999997
what did i watch once again oh yeah yeah

409.68 --> 415.28000000000003
pacific rim i watched that one what a

412.72 --> 415.28000000000003
spectacle

415.68 --> 421.84000000000003
there's a lot of neon lights going on in

417.599 --> 424.08
that movie

421.84 --> 426.08
oh yeah god also watched the first

424.08 --> 427.5
paddington movie i hadn't seen that one

426.08 --> 430.71999999999997
yet

427.5 --> 435.36
[Music]

430.72 --> 435.36
it was pretty much what i expected

435.68 --> 441.36
maybe even sillier than the second one

439.12 --> 441.36
uh

445.199 --> 451.84000000000003
right i think that pretty much sums it

448.84 --> 451.84
up

452.96 --> 457.599
oh yeah in between somewhere i also

455.039 --> 462.15999999999997
watched alex jones

457.599 --> 465.84
uh hey rocket blimps

462.16 --> 465.84000000000003
tony whitcomb

467.52 --> 473.52
good to see you in chat yeah

470.56 --> 476.16
i came up with a title during uh my

473.52 --> 479.599
bicycle ride

476.16 --> 483.44
just came to me i thought it was a

479.599 --> 485.68
really great metaphor totally down my

483.44 --> 485.68
lane

486.16 --> 489.36
i think it's it should be plenty obvious

488.879 --> 493.84000000000003
what

489.36 --> 493.84000000000003
what it stands for

498.879 --> 504.84000000000003
nice bit of arwenian wisdom

502.4 --> 507.44
for although it's not really mine it's

504.84 --> 511.039
universal

507.44 --> 511.039
i like to put it down like that

511.199 --> 515.12
so yeah how your

515.2 --> 522.399
day's been pretty much

518.839 --> 524.24
open for any subject right now

522.399 --> 526.0
although yeah it seemed to be a little

524.24 --> 527.279
out of breath but it's it's because it's

526.0 --> 530.72
so moist

527.279 --> 535.68
it really is so yeah i got green

530.72 --> 538.08
tea with me but yeah

535.68 --> 539.76
i don't know what that's gonna do to me

538.08 --> 542.64
because it's so moist and then

539.76 --> 545.04
things like are differently they're

542.64 --> 545.04
different

545.279 --> 563.8389999999999
in your endo okay

548.48 --> 563.839
iron 26 hello and chad

574.32 --> 581.9200000000001
right i don't get the joke i'm 26

577.519 --> 581.92
cameron kamikaze gilmore seems to win

584.959 --> 593.8389999999999
why are wombats not good partners what i

591.2 --> 593.839
don't know

599.44 --> 602.24
too obvious

602.56 --> 607.92
well it's the obviousness seems to elude

616.839 --> 619.839
me

629.68 --> 633.8389999999999
because he eats roots and leaves

634.64 --> 636.88
oh

639.41 --> 645.12
[Music]

641.76 --> 647.36
okay okay okay

645.12 --> 649.92
i guess that that's kind of like a 10th

647.36 --> 649.92
man joke

654.959 --> 661.8389999999999
i require a little more than that but

656.88 --> 661.8389999999999
nice try

664.959 --> 675.1999999999999
roots mean sex in australia what

668.959 --> 677.76
oh okay i i wow

675.2 --> 677.76
all right

681.12 --> 684.0
right well that

684.24 --> 687.36
well maybe that applies to the title as

686.959 --> 691.04
well

687.36 --> 694.24
i thought that all the things that i

691.04 --> 694.7199999999999
applied are all typically a figure of

694.24 --> 696.72
speech

694.72 --> 698.72
type of expression all three of the

696.72 --> 699.36
elements in the title so they would

698.72 --> 701.9200000000001
pretty much

699.36 --> 704.0
apply to anything and that's why i made

701.92 --> 707.12
it like that because it's universal

704.0 --> 708.48
it's fractal in nature can apply to a

707.12 --> 710.16
lot of things

708.48 --> 711.519
and in a way that anybody would

710.16 --> 715.279
understand and that's

711.519 --> 720.639
like one of these little things

715.279 --> 725.2
that i like it it's kind of exoterizing

720.639 --> 725.2
making exoteric an esoteric truth

725.279 --> 733.68
it's what i like to do

730.32 --> 735.7600000000001
using the exoterics to make it memorable

733.68 --> 737.92
and the esoterics well they're just

735.76 --> 738.959
there and that's why people understand

737.92 --> 742.8389999999999
it

738.959 --> 745.8389999999999
because yeah these are all commonly used

742.839 --> 745.839
elements

748.32 --> 751.839
so you could interpret it societal i

750.56 --> 756.7199999999999
guess you could also

751.839 --> 759.6
interpret it relationship wise

756.72 --> 761.9200000000001
with your australian version of the word

759.6 --> 761.9200000000001
root

763.76 --> 771.8389999999999
and literal you can just apply it to

767.839 --> 776.8800000000001
to growing or to trees to nature

771.839 --> 776.8800000000001
it's yeah it applies to everything

779.44 --> 785.2790000000001
it was lamenting being single

783.12 --> 786.24
wow well that shows you where your

785.279 --> 789.04
mind's at

786.24 --> 789.519
iron 26 i don't blame you necessarily it

789.04 --> 792.56
is

789.519 --> 795.68
spring time after all but

792.56 --> 801.8389999999999
that was not my idea of it

795.68 --> 801.8389999999999
right i i don't really mind being single

805.44 --> 812.1600000000001
although yeah there there are

808.56 --> 814.6389999999999
i do have like certain girls

812.16 --> 817.1999999999999
that i do kind of find cute or very

814.639 --> 817.2
interesting

817.92 --> 821.199
but i am so tough to connect you know

820.24 --> 823.76
and just

821.199 --> 825.92
i do consider like what if i i tried it

823.76 --> 828.959
out where would it go

825.92 --> 830.24
like what would i reason what should i

828.959 --> 834.8
be reasonably

830.24 --> 837.04
expecting and at some point i just

834.8 --> 838.079
should step forward and try something

837.04 --> 840.639
out and then

838.079 --> 841.279
probably expect to mess up because i

840.639 --> 843.92
haven't

841.279 --> 846.079
really tried in such a long time to even

843.92 --> 849.5999999999999
connect like that

846.079 --> 857.8389999999999
but i know i have all the abilities

849.6 --> 857.839
required if i can focus properly

858.24 --> 871.839
all right

872.32 --> 876.399
right but you could also apply the title

875.76 --> 879.4399999999999
to

876.399 --> 881.76
just socializing attitude to way of

879.44 --> 883.2790000000001
communicating and then it applies to the

881.76 --> 886.639
ballers

883.279 --> 889.76
because who more out there do we know

886.639 --> 892.72
that are all bark and no roots they're

889.76 --> 895.8389999999999
all blah blah blah blah blah

892.72 --> 899.0400000000001
all the glorious bark but no

895.839 --> 899.839
actual roots no foundation of realness

899.04 --> 902.8
to

899.839 --> 903.839
to give it life to to provide it the

902.8 --> 905.76
life juices

903.839 --> 907.839
because there's no roots they're all cut

905.76 --> 911.36
off

907.839 --> 913.44
right so they are effectively dead wood

911.36 --> 914.5600000000001
and just the tiniest of spark will

913.44 --> 917.519
ignite them

914.56 --> 917.5189999999999
and burn them up

918.32 --> 927.1600000000001
see it applies to many

921.44 --> 930.24
many things

927.16 --> 930.24
[Music]

938.399 --> 942.48
right you could even apply it to

942.72 --> 946.399
to like the spiritual body right your

945.68 --> 948.4799999999999
roots

946.399 --> 949.519
the thing that connects your spirit to

948.48 --> 952.5600000000001
the earth and

949.519 --> 955.759
grounds you into your body well it

952.56 --> 958.399
applies like that as well

955.759 --> 958.399
all bark

959.36 --> 964.639
if you put things down with your spirit

962.48 --> 966.16
if you try to manifest things but you're

964.639 --> 969.279
not rooted

966.16 --> 972.0
yeah it's it's gonna die

969.279 --> 973.92
it's gonna get cut off energy wise and

972.0 --> 975.279
that way it'll be dead wood so it

973.92 --> 978.16
applies to everything

975.279 --> 981.12
everything it's a it's a fisture rule

978.16 --> 981.12
it's universal

981.36 --> 983.839
uh

987.839 --> 991.519
makes sense to awake people well that's

989.759 --> 995.279
what i do

991.519 --> 997.279
right i present puzzles and the more

995.279 --> 999.6
sharp you are the wider your

997.279 --> 1002.48
understanding the more fractal thinking

999.6 --> 1002.48
you can apply

1004.0 --> 1012.56
the more well what i do will yield

1009.36 --> 1015.6
feed to the growth of just that the

1012.56 --> 1015.5999999999999
fractal thinking

1016.32 --> 1019.44
it's like one of my personal primary

1018.639 --> 1022.16
objectives

1019.44 --> 1023.0400000000001
to do that and it is the critical part

1022.16 --> 1026.559
of my

1023.04 --> 1026.559
wizard training you could say

1027.439 --> 1034.3190000000002
to keep that fractal inside and to

1030.64 --> 1034.3190000000002
cherish it and grow it

1036.48 --> 1040.799
but also very important thus to maintain

1039.839 --> 1045.52
the roots

1040.799 --> 1045.52
that's yeah constantly it's very

1050.84 --> 1053.84
critical

1054.48 --> 1062.559
right iron 26 yeah that's okay look

1059.039 --> 1065.6
the thing is you saw it

1062.559 --> 1066.8799999999999
and it it does apply it literally

1065.6 --> 1070.08
applies to that too

1066.88 --> 1074.0800000000002
see so you thought oh that's funny

1070.08 --> 1077.4399999999998
but it's also true so yeah i got again

1074.08 --> 1079.4399999999998
more fractal application see

1077.44 --> 1080.96
that's what i love that's why i got it

1079.44 --> 1083.6000000000001
in my head and

1080.96 --> 1084.559
on the way and i couldn't get it out

1083.6 --> 1087.6
just knew like that

1084.559 --> 1088.6399999999999
is the title just kept repeating over

1087.6 --> 1092.48
and over in my head

1088.64 --> 1095.8400000000001
and new sights on how how it actually

1092.48 --> 1098.88
means something so and the same thing

1095.84 --> 1103.4399999999998
but in other contexts

1098.88 --> 1103.44
right so very proud about today's title

1106.84 --> 1109.84
huh

1131.919 --> 1138.88
right oh yeah uh

1136.799 --> 1141.12
maybe an interesting development there

1138.88 --> 1142.96
might be some kind of a night i'll show

1141.12 --> 1143.84
at some point although i don't know

1142.96 --> 1146.96
exactly when

1143.84 --> 1148.8799999999999
it might kind of slip slip into

1146.96 --> 1152.4
forgetfulness again

1148.88 --> 1153.44
but adam and me had a bit of a short

1152.4 --> 1157.3600000000001
conversation

1153.44 --> 1161.28
and i basically invited him like

1157.36 --> 1164.6399999999999
hey let's do a show together

1161.28 --> 1167.84
a night owl show about

1164.64 --> 1169.44
the looping mechanisms and about the

1167.84 --> 1172.6399999999999
celestial lights

1169.44 --> 1174.3200000000002
like the the way that i see it

1172.64 --> 1176.8400000000001
especially the celestial lights that's

1174.32 --> 1179.84
the more important part

1176.84 --> 1183.1999999999998
because my modeling of it

1179.84 --> 1185.28
through the holographic

1183.2 --> 1187.44
yeah local light manifest non-local

1185.28 --> 1189.28
light manifestation

1187.44 --> 1190.559
right of it and how that works

1189.28 --> 1193.84
mechanically and

1190.559 --> 1196.799
what it causes you to see and why

1193.84 --> 1198.6399999999999
this thing is very strenuous and tough

1196.799 --> 1201.76
for a lot of people to understand

1198.64 --> 1203.76
on the flatter side right never mind the

1201.76 --> 1204.64
globers right they're just completely

1203.76 --> 1208.64
like what

1204.64 --> 1210.159
is this but even to a flat earther it's

1208.64 --> 1212.88
complicated

1210.159 --> 1214.3200000000002
and apparently even to him it's still

1212.88 --> 1217.7600000000002
complicated so

1214.32 --> 1221.2
we're gonna we got a like a skype date

1217.76 --> 1225.2
offline where i he's gonna ask me

1221.2 --> 1228.4
and get me to explain every conceivable

1225.2 --> 1230.4
angle to it to him so that

1228.4 --> 1232.48
he would understand because he said he

1230.4 --> 1234.24
wanted to fully understand before we do

1232.48 --> 1235.3600000000001
a live show together he doesn't want to

1234.24 --> 1238.559
be

1235.36 --> 1241.9189999999999
educated during that live show which is

1238.559 --> 1241.9189999999999
absolutely understandable

1244.88 --> 1250.5590000000002
hey hello dark steve and matthew

1248.0 --> 1252.64
matthias the walking witness good to see

1250.559 --> 1254.559
you in chat

1252.64 --> 1257.1200000000001
right so that may happen somewhere in

1254.559 --> 1257.12
the future

1259.039 --> 1263.28
that could be an interesting night i'll

1260.84 --> 1267.9189999999999
show

1263.28 --> 1267.9189999999999
so keep a look now yeah look out for

1274.84 --> 1277.84
that

1288.84 --> 1291.84
haha

1292.0 --> 1308.24
a nathan oakley 1980

1305.2 --> 1312.24
by the way iron 26 i i just realized you

1308.24 --> 1314.559
can take the title even further

1312.24 --> 1315.28
with the no root interpretation and make

1314.559 --> 1319.16
it about

1315.28 --> 1322.1589999999999
like transsexuals

1319.16 --> 1326.0
[Laughter]

1322.159 --> 1329.2
oh god yeah

1326.0 --> 1332.88
it applies to everything don't know why

1329.2 --> 1335.3600000000001
i needed to bring that last one up but

1332.88 --> 1336.64
you kind of like surprised me about the

1335.36 --> 1347.84
the general meaning of

1336.64 --> 1347.8400000000001
root in australian

1373.6 --> 1376.9599999999998
so what's on your mind

1379.52 --> 1383.039
interested in nathan's first impression

1381.6 --> 1386.84
of the title yeah me too

1383.039 --> 1389.84
nathan what do you think what comes to

1386.84 --> 1389.84
mind

1397.96 --> 1401.079
[Music]

1404.93 --> 1408.559
[Music]

1416.88 --> 1432.4
really rocket blimps oh my god i

1430.159 --> 1434.72
i wouldn't necessarily say speaking of

1432.4 --> 1439.1200000000001
trans more like speaking of dead wood

1434.72 --> 1439.1200000000001
yeah nobody's more deadwood than simon

1442.84 --> 1445.84
dad

1449.44 --> 1453.279
matthew is the walking witness well that

1451.44 --> 1456.0800000000002
yeah i mentioned that one earlier

1453.279 --> 1459.84
yes that is definitely also a way to

1456.08 --> 1459.84
interpret it

1460.159 --> 1464.7990000000002
right they bark all over the place

1467.2 --> 1470.64
but they have no foundation in their

1469.279 --> 1472.799
arguments

1470.64 --> 1475.5200000000002
so they just keep on moving on it's just

1472.799 --> 1477.76
a wild growth

1475.52 --> 1481.039
but they have no roots so it's all gonna

1477.76 --> 1481.039
just die off quickly

1481.52 --> 1487.84
more like weeds bowlers are much more

1485.039 --> 1487.84
like weeds like that

1498.84 --> 1501.84
hmm

1505.44 --> 1515.8400000000001
hey amanda young good to see you hey

1508.559 --> 1515.84
we've got another photograph

1540.84 --> 1543.84
hmm

1545.2 --> 1549.279
but i like wheat not weed as in cannabis

1548.88 --> 1553.6000000000001
just

1549.279 --> 1553.6
weeds as in the the plant type

1554.84 --> 1557.84
designation

1558.159 --> 1566.3200000000002
although technically cannabis is a weed

1562.0 --> 1570.4
the plant is really like a wheat

1566.32 --> 1572.96
survives anything right

1570.4 --> 1574.0
and hey some weeds are good some weeds

1572.96 --> 1585.8400000000001
are actually

1574.0 --> 1585.84
really good food

1592.72 --> 1597.84
that kind of like when

1595.84 --> 1599.6
they claim they are rocket scientists

1597.84 --> 1601.36
then you ask for credentials and they

1599.6 --> 1627.84
don't present

1601.36 --> 1627.84
i don't want to dox myself hmm

1637.84 --> 1643.52
right but yeah tony i don't know man

1641.12 --> 1644.6399999999999
i find simon then like totally

1643.52 --> 1648.08
underwhelming

1644.64 --> 1650.0
with everything like it's just it's not

1648.08 --> 1653.52
interesting

1650.0 --> 1657.919
he's not creative like he

1653.52 --> 1657.9189999999999
he doesn't have any creativity

1663.279 --> 1670.08
smd is he getting fat

1666.84 --> 1670.48
really i haven't seen him on camera in a

1670.08 --> 1673.6789999999999
while

1670.48 --> 1673.679
could be i don't know man

1680.64 --> 1697.8400000000001
you those edits what

1704.64 --> 1709.76
most ballers are no different than a

1706.24 --> 1709.76
poorly programmed ai

1713.919 --> 1717.5200000000002
they have so little maneuvering room to

1716.0 --> 1719.36
accomplish anything right

1717.52 --> 1721.9189999999999
so yeah they're always going to be

1719.36 --> 1725.36
highly oversimplified and railroaded

1721.919 --> 1727.679
and that's exactly how ai works

1725.36 --> 1728.8799999999999
a good programmed ai is just find the

1727.679 --> 1732.0
most efficient

1728.88 --> 1736.24
pattern and program

1732.0 --> 1736.24
it to go to those things

1736.399 --> 1740.0
lay out the railroad options

1740.88 --> 1745.279
and then yeah the interactions do the

1743.52 --> 1747.679
rest

1745.279 --> 1753.44
so yeah the that's not even too far off

1747.679 --> 1757.919
that comparison

1753.44 --> 1767.52
some funny vids really funny

1757.919 --> 1771.1200000000001
sorry more like annoying

1767.52 --> 1771.12
like how is it funny

1774.24 --> 1779.44
can't talk for more than 10 seconds and

1776.88 --> 1782.159
then he edits oh he's one of those

1779.44 --> 1782.799
short editing right yeah that's a bad

1782.159 --> 1795.8400000000001
habit

1782.799 --> 1795.84
very annoying

1809.76 --> 1813.919
neil hello neil

1816.399 --> 1823.84
oh do you hear that rooster in the

1820.84 --> 1823.84
background

1825.6 --> 1838.1589999999999
he's going at it

1836.83 --> 1840.8799999999999
[Music]

1838.159 --> 1843.989
ah eat stuff

1840.88 --> 1843.989
[Music]

1848.84 --> 1851.84
okay

1855.52 --> 1860.08
man i just so annoying i got so hungry

1858.72 --> 1863.3600000000001
just now

1860.08 --> 1867.84
it's distracting why do i get hungry

1863.36 --> 1867.84
this is during the show

1868.159 --> 1873.2
there really was a point especially in

1870.559 --> 1879.84
the earlier days of the early bird show

1873.2 --> 1879.8400000000001
where i had something to eat

1892.24 --> 1897.519
flat earth millionaire who

1895.279 --> 1907.84
is that what are you talking about

1897.519 --> 1907.84
matthias the walking witness

1918.96 --> 1921.8400000000001
come on

1934.88 --> 1939.6000000000001
ah are you seeking star wars

1940.88 --> 1944.159
don't show me a pizza

1946.0 --> 1952.72
i do actually have pizza

1949.2 --> 1956.24
like ready to prepare

1952.72 --> 1958.159
but it's not there so

1956.24 --> 1963.84
if i quickly want to eat something it's

1958.159 --> 1963.8400000000001
gonna just be a slice of bread

1967.279 --> 1972.32
okay i think i am actually gonna do that

1970.08 --> 1974.799
because if my stomach is like

1972.32 --> 1976.08
really nagging me so i'm gonna quickly

1974.799 --> 1991.84
get that

1976.08 --> 1991.84
i'll be right back

2016.84 --> 2019.84
so

2026.32 --> 2033.84
just a basic slice

2037.2 --> 2047.8400000000001
hey clutch bear

2058.839 --> 2061.839
so

2072.839 --> 2075.839
hmm

2077.359 --> 2080.72
yeah clutch bear uh there's no direct

2080.159 --> 2084.399
topic

2080.72 --> 2084.399
part of the topic is the title

2085.679 --> 2089.76
it's kind of universal so we're just

2088.399 --> 2092.879
talking about that

2089.76 --> 2095.44
but i i'm willing to

2092.879 --> 2098.0
address any more specific subject if

2095.44 --> 2103.839
anybody wants that

2098.0 --> 2103.839
i'll leave it up to you

2114.839 --> 2131.839
hmm

2116.4 --> 2131.839
bread with fresh coconut okay

2134.8 --> 2145.8390000000004
hey slow mo moon buggy

2156.839 --> 2159.839
so

2170.839 --> 2176.7999999999997
so

2172.88 --> 2176.8
yeah clutch bear just read the title

2177.2 --> 2181.68
i came up with it during grocery shop

2179.599 --> 2184.48
shopping

2181.68 --> 2185.1189999999997
and it's like a really dynamic fractal

2184.48 --> 2187.359
natured

2185.119 --> 2188.48
title that adapts to a whole bunch of

2187.359 --> 2190.96
things

2188.48 --> 2192.32
it's like a universal formula expressed

2190.96 --> 2196.32
in

2192.32 --> 2199.52
typically used words in sayings

2196.32 --> 2201.44
so it's very esoteric and yeah it's

2199.52 --> 2204.56
fascinating

2201.44 --> 2206.0
we've already figured out like just

2204.56 --> 2209.2799999999997
first glance like five

2206.0 --> 2215.839
different ways the five different fields

2209.28 --> 2215.8390000000004
to which it applies

2231.04 --> 2235.44
the bible calls for circumcis what

2235.52 --> 2243.839
uh no

2251.2 --> 2259.9199999999996
i think that's all old testament stuff

2256.8 --> 2263.119
pretty sure jesus said that you don't

2259.92 --> 2263.119
need to do that anymore

2265.04 --> 2270.88
universal formulaic esmc

2268.079 --> 2273.119
squared well the thing is e is mc

2270.88 --> 2276.6400000000003
squared doesn't actually mean anything

2273.119 --> 2277.52
it doesn't apply to anything physically

2276.64 --> 2282.24
real

2277.52 --> 2285.839
it's a tie in together of a whole

2282.24 --> 2285.839
conceptual framework

2286.8 --> 2299.8390000000004
but it's not actually real

2305.599 --> 2308.48
right but

2310.16 --> 2318.3199999999997
right so also when it's said

2314.0 --> 2318.32
that god made man in his image

2318.96 --> 2322.56
brackets perfect really is that what

2321.76 --> 2326.48
that means

2322.56 --> 2329.44
is that literally what it says

2326.48 --> 2330.48
or does it mean something slightly

2329.44 --> 2332.8
different

2330.48 --> 2337.68
[Music]

2332.8 --> 2340.0
isn't is it an it could be

2337.68 --> 2340.7999999999997
seen in a whole bunch of different ways

2340.0 --> 2343.92
you see

2340.8 --> 2346.32
in his image could literally be in the

2343.92 --> 2346.32
picture

2348.72 --> 2351.04
or

2351.839 --> 2356.56
having the resemblance like the design

2354.56 --> 2360.24
based on the design

2356.56 --> 2364.4
that god adapted for himself

2360.24 --> 2369.5989999999997
when envisioning a form for himself

2364.4 --> 2373.119
or well those are kind of the two

2369.599 --> 2378.32
that i would imagine not

2373.119 --> 2378.32
a perfection man was never perfect

2379.599 --> 2385.599
or what suggested that originally

2383.2 --> 2386.56
he might have been perfect in paradise

2385.599 --> 2389.92
until he

2386.56 --> 2389.92
transgressed and then

2390.16 --> 2395.5989999999997
well wasn't perfect anymore

2393.2 --> 2398.0
that's kind of the suggestion of that

2395.599 --> 2401.28
situation there

2398.0 --> 2402.16
so to say he is in god's image that

2401.28 --> 2405.599
means perfect

2402.16 --> 2411.839
seems kind of a long jump to me

2405.599 --> 2411.839
to interpret it like that

2413.119 --> 2416.56
so why the snippy snip

2416.72 --> 2424.64
well you already know the reasons as to

2420.0 --> 2428.319
why they supposedly do that

2424.64 --> 2432.0
primarily to make it look bigger

2428.319 --> 2435.68
or hygienic issues or whatever

2432.0 --> 2437.28
but yeah that that has nothing to do i i

2435.68 --> 2440.3999999999996
don't

2437.28 --> 2442.96
like i don't did god actually tell

2440.4 --> 2445.2000000000003
anybody like even in the old testament

2442.96 --> 2448.7200000000003
do that

2445.2 --> 2451.4399999999996
or was it the people

2448.72 --> 2452.3999999999996
that were like appointed or anointed but

2451.44 --> 2455.76
not anointed but

2452.4 --> 2458.88
yeah appointed blessed

2455.76 --> 2462.8
by god god

2458.88 --> 2466.079
waking over them did they

2462.8 --> 2468.2400000000002
decide to do that

2466.079 --> 2471.28
i don't know might be wrong i don't

2468.24 --> 2471.2799999999997
think god asked

2472.72 --> 2477.1189999999997
i don't think god literally told them

2475.52 --> 2480.48
you should do this

2477.119 --> 2495.839
i think they themselves thought

2480.48 --> 2495.839
we should do this

2496.8 --> 2499.92
mark of a covenant

2500.4 --> 2507.119
so does that mean it's a command

2503.599 --> 2509.839
or is it a deal see that's a big

2507.119 --> 2509.839
difference

2510.4 --> 2515.6800000000003
a covenant a specific covenant is not

2520.839 --> 2523.839
universal

2527.599 --> 2537.839
right right unicorn laser eyes

2542.24 --> 2548.0
all right well matthias the walking

2544.96 --> 2548.0
witness right so

2548.64 --> 2556.56
did jesus say that should be done

2552.72 --> 2565.4399999999996
did jesus himself do that

2556.56 --> 2569.04
to somebody else no

2565.44 --> 2571.839
like does it matter what who jesus

2569.04 --> 2573.04
was like what his traits were physically

2571.839 --> 2577.52
does that matter

2573.04 --> 2577.52
to anything that's a serious question

2577.599 --> 2581.52
does his physical form matter to

2580.319 --> 2584.64
anything

2581.52 --> 2588.319
within the esoteric

2584.64 --> 2592.8799999999997
glory that is jesus christ

2588.319 --> 2597.2799999999997
glory from god perfect example

2592.88 --> 2601.28
no his words his teachings

2597.28 --> 2601.28
what he did right

2605.76 --> 2612.4
and how he did it and why

2609.04 --> 2616.16
so ah

2612.4 --> 2616.1600000000003
neil yuck

2616.319 --> 2621.839
he's logos in the flesh uh

2632.839 --> 2635.839
right

2667.2 --> 2673.68
what the [ __ ] neil can can you please

2670.24 --> 2677.839
leave did that sort of talk

2673.68 --> 2677.839
for a later hang out the hell

2694.75 --> 2700.949
[Music]

2697.76 --> 2700.949
[Applause]

2701.02 --> 2704.54
[Music]

2702.839 --> 2708.32
so

2704.54 --> 2708.32
[Music]

2730.839 --> 2733.839
this

2736.4 --> 2740.2400000000002
get a handle on the convo

2740.72 --> 2743.5989999999997
uh yeah

2744.88 --> 2748.48
oh somebody asked the question what i

2747.119 --> 2750.96
thought about it

2748.48 --> 2753.359
and so i explained to put it into

2750.96 --> 2756.2400000000002
context

2753.359 --> 2758.24
does it mean that's like oh let's talk

2756.24 --> 2760.72
about our ding-dongs or whatever

2758.24 --> 2775.839
that that wasn't the cue for that it was

2760.72 --> 2775.839
just a technical question

2803.92 --> 2806.96
yeah neil you have to realize that the

2806.079 --> 2809.2000000000003
conversation

2806.96 --> 2810.88
is literally being immortalized and

2809.2 --> 2813.2799999999997
recorded

2810.88 --> 2818.4
so you might want to get a grip on what

2813.28 --> 2818.4
you're talking about you're out

2828.839 --> 2831.839
okay

2842.839 --> 2845.839
so

2846.4 --> 2849.6800000000003
you answer question

2851.119 --> 2855.839
what did somebody ask you if you were

2853.04 --> 2855.839
circumcised

2856.839 --> 2859.839
really

2865.76 --> 2870.7200000000003
i think you just brought it up but i'm

2868.24 --> 2886.4799999999996
i'm gonna stop nagging you now about it

2870.72 --> 2889.1189999999997
it's alright

2886.48 --> 2891.28
you kind of did but let's let's drop it

2889.119 --> 2891.28
now

2897.119 --> 2914.7200000000003
don't bread joke what

2900.88 --> 2917.92
did i miss that

2914.72 --> 2921.2
oh that yeah i ignored it

2917.92 --> 2924.079
it was stupid i think i didn't get it

2921.2 --> 2924.8799999999997
and if there's some creepy thing to that

2924.079 --> 2928.48
then yeah i

2924.88 --> 2932.7200000000003
ignored it because that's

2928.48 --> 2932.72
like no don't don't do that

2940.839 --> 2943.839
anyway

2950.72 --> 2956.16
this show will be age restricted no i

2953.119 --> 2958.559
don't think so

2956.16 --> 2961.52
i certainly don't think so but it is

2958.559 --> 2971.8390000000004
already standard age restricted 12

2961.52 --> 2971.839
so my show is always gonna be in that

2980.24 --> 2989.04
right so

2985.68 --> 2989.04
what's going on out there

2989.52 --> 2999.839
any development

3010.839 --> 3013.839
hmm

3021.839 --> 3030.48
right there seems to be some uh

3026.96 --> 3031.359
like active attempt to uh kind of like

3030.48 --> 3035.119
signal

3031.359 --> 3036.88
that the controllers want to crack down

3035.119 --> 3040.2400000000002
on anti-vaxxers

3036.88 --> 3045.119
to be expected because we're totally

3040.24 --> 3045.1189999999997
breaking the spell all of us

3045.2 --> 3055.839
and not stopping as we should

3082.24 --> 3086.72
ah you saw me there clutch bear i wanted

3084.64 --> 3089.44
to ask you that was pretty cool

3086.72 --> 3092.0
how did i enjoy that well a lot that

3089.44 --> 3095.119
it's great being back

3092.0 --> 3097.28
because i really like being a

3095.119 --> 3099.44
chat participant is somebody that's

3097.28 --> 3102.48
definitely

3099.44 --> 3107.28
that has fractal talents that is an

3102.48 --> 3108.559
empath a developed empath and owen

3107.28 --> 3112.6400000000003
benjamin is he is

3108.559 --> 3112.6400000000003
the bard he is the slayer of smoke

3113.599 --> 3125.839
and i'm legolas and i'm gonna help out

3143.839 --> 3147.599
okay iron 26

3150.839 --> 3153.839
what

3161.119 --> 3164.7200000000003
what is it amanda young are you all

3164.839 --> 3167.839
right

3176.24 --> 3181.839
is the camera recording reality or are

3178.96 --> 3184.0
our eyes experiencing the reality

3181.839 --> 3186.5589999999997
no they're both just observational

3184.0 --> 3190.16
mediums

3186.559 --> 3192.3190000000004
and it is the consciousness

3190.16 --> 3196.16
throughout the timeless entanglement

3192.319 --> 3199.52
that is supposedly going to cause

3196.16 --> 3199.52
the wave function collapse

3199.68 --> 3204.72
so it's not our eyes and it is not the

3202.16 --> 3210.0789999999997
camera it is the consciousness

3204.72 --> 3210.0789999999997
that can utilize the observational

3210.64 --> 3213.359
mechanism

3214.48 --> 3221.44
to basically influence

3218.8 --> 3224.319
the thing the real thing through the

3221.44 --> 3227.359
observational medium

3224.319 --> 3230.319
by having our attention on it that's how

3227.359 --> 3230.319
it's supposed to work

3235.28 --> 3251.8390000000004
ob what

3258.16 --> 3263.839
camera records more data than we can see

3261.2 --> 3265.04
well technically our eyes record more

3263.839 --> 3269.44
data than

3265.04 --> 3269.44
most can actually utilize

3272.16 --> 3277.1189999999997
right especially when you consider that

3275.28 --> 3280.7200000000003
lights very likely to be

3277.119 --> 3282.96
infinitely divisible beams well

3280.72 --> 3284.16
that means that the observation medium

3282.96 --> 3288.48
any observation

3284.16 --> 3293.04
medium any device that observes

3288.48 --> 3296.559
that is going to yeah apply optics

3293.04 --> 3300.799
is going to have this limit

3296.559 --> 3302.96
due to the critical mass of the

3300.799 --> 3306.0
material interaction with the light in

3302.96 --> 3308.7200000000003
order to register whether there is light

3306.0 --> 3311.119
right so it really depends on the

3308.72 --> 3313.5989999999997
molecular

3311.119 --> 3315.04
system that it receives the light

3313.599 --> 3317.44
whether you can see it

3315.04 --> 3317.44
or not

3319.44 --> 3322.64
and then there's the brain that

3321.68 --> 3325.839
basically

3322.64 --> 3327.839
takes a grab out of it so i bet that the

3325.839 --> 3328.799
actual eye capabilities of a lot of

3327.839 --> 3331.2
people

3328.799 --> 3333.599
are a lot more high resolution and have

3331.2 --> 3337.68
a lot more data even than the brain

3333.599 --> 3339.04
uses of it right because the brain uses

3337.68 --> 3341.44
an extract

3339.04 --> 3342.48
and it does that on purpose limit the

3341.44 --> 3347.2000000000003
data

3342.48 --> 3349.119
to maintain focus

3347.2 --> 3350.799
to allow the person to keep their

3349.119 --> 3353.119
concentration and not be

3350.799 --> 3354.079
distracted by the massive constant

3353.119 --> 3363.839
influx

3354.079 --> 3363.8390000000004
of visual data

3370.0 --> 3374.16
i thought the camera recorded data we

3372.24 --> 3376.0
couldn't even see in doubles

3374.16 --> 3378.5589999999997
that's poorly formulated i don't know

3376.0 --> 3378.559
what you mean

3384.72 --> 3390.3999999999996
oh wait ob oh and benjamin right oh yeah

3387.2 --> 3395.68
she doesn't like it

3390.4 --> 3395.6800000000003
oh i do

3401.44 --> 3407.2000000000003
most of the time anyway safely eighty

3404.88 --> 3410.2400000000002
percent

3407.2 --> 3412.16
but yeah the the same goes for myself

3410.24 --> 3419.839
good moments and i have not so

3412.16 --> 3419.839
interesting moments

3432.799 --> 3437.2
camera records lens flares we can see

3435.52 --> 3437.92
that with our eyes even though our eyes

3437.2 --> 3441.04
are lens

3437.92 --> 3443.44
well matthew that's

3441.04 --> 3445.359
interesting that you mentioned that

3443.44 --> 3450.4
don't we see lens flares

3445.359 --> 3450.4
at all i think we do

3450.72 --> 3454.8799999999997
but like the overwhelming output of the

3453.28 --> 3460.0
data causes us

3454.88 --> 3463.2000000000003
our mechanisms in our brain to basically

3460.0 --> 3465.28
rearrange the situation so that it's not

3463.2 --> 3468.0
too overwhelming so that unite

3465.28 --> 3469.0400000000004
might actually the lens flare might be

3468.0 --> 3471.119
observed you just

3469.04 --> 3472.5589999999997
don't get to see it you don't get to

3471.119 --> 3474.7200000000003
that point because you really have to

3472.559 --> 3476.6400000000003
stare kind of into the sun

3474.72 --> 3479.5989999999997
but there might be another reason and

3476.64 --> 3482.72
that is that cameras

3479.599 --> 3485.839
don't have a liquid optical medium

3482.72 --> 3489.4399999999996
they have glass lenses that end up in

3485.839 --> 3492.88
i don't know vacuum or just gas

3489.44 --> 3495.44
right our eyes are filled with liquid

3492.88 --> 3498.1600000000003
so that liquid could potentially i don't

3495.44 --> 3500.4
know for sure but it could be the factor

3498.16 --> 3501.68
that kind of removes the lens flare

3500.4 --> 3504.88
effect

3501.68 --> 3504.8799999999997
right it's just a guess

3505.04 --> 3508.48
can be either way there's a mechanism

3508.16 --> 3510.799
that

3508.48 --> 3512.96
kind of like takes it away because it's

3510.799 --> 3514.799
actually disturbing

3512.96 --> 3518.16
to see light lens flares it's like a

3514.799 --> 3521.839
holographic bright light

3518.16 --> 3524.0789999999997
very intrusive or it could be

3521.839 --> 3526.72
that you literally can't see it because

3524.079 --> 3530.6400000000003
there is a liquid medium

3526.72 --> 3533.7599999999998
in eyes right just guessing

3530.64 --> 3545.839
i think i'm i got a good guess hello

3533.76 --> 3545.8390000000004
rest ahead

3547.68 --> 3551.359
a willian double j

3557.2 --> 3561.359
you think the moon is a reflection of

3559.04 --> 3564.5589999999997
the sun i don't

3561.359 --> 3564.5589999999997
no no it's not

3564.88 --> 3569.839
right if you're gonna go in that

3566.16 --> 3569.839
direction you could start to

3570.0 --> 3576.24
argue that all the celestial lights are

3573.04 --> 3578.4
basically one light that is being

3576.24 --> 3579.9199999999996
like scattered in a very specific

3578.4 --> 3583.04
pre-arranged pattern

3579.92 --> 3584.799
that it's all literally one light

3583.04 --> 3586.5589999999997
right if you start to think like that

3584.799 --> 3589.839
and who knows

3586.559 --> 3593.8390000000004
it's kind of our starkin

3589.839 --> 3597.839
idea it's all one single light but

3593.839 --> 3600.0789999999997
there's really no point because

3597.839 --> 3603.04
where is that singular source right how

3600.079 --> 3603.04
are you gonna test it

3606.64 --> 3610.0789999999997
right i think it's a much more

3608.16 --> 3613.2799999999997
interesting fact

3610.079 --> 3615.3590000000004
that it's like not caught physically

3613.28 --> 3617.28
coming from a source that it's just

3615.359 --> 3620.4
manifesting

3617.28 --> 3622.7200000000003
the way it does that concept

3620.4 --> 3624.559
is much more interesting to me right and

3622.72 --> 3628.24
i assume this

3624.559 --> 3632.0
vantage point due to the and

3628.24 --> 3633.9199999999996
complete and entire lack of evidence

3632.0 --> 3635.2
that any of the celestial lights

3633.92 --> 3637.839
actually do come

3635.2 --> 3638.64
from a physical object or specific

3637.839 --> 3642.64
position

3638.64 --> 3645.7599999999998
in euclidean space that's why i have

3642.64 --> 3647.68
i'm taking the luxury position just

3645.76 --> 3651.599
assuming they are not physical

3647.68 --> 3654.3999999999996
and actually light manifesting

3651.599 --> 3656.48
like sourceless light there's an energy

3654.4 --> 3659.44
source for it no doubt

3656.48 --> 3660.319
but it's not like like that we make here

3659.44 --> 3663.44
on earth with

3660.319 --> 3666.5589999999997
objects through electricity

3663.44 --> 3670.0
or combustion it's just

3666.559 --> 3672.0
light manifesting probably electrically

3670.0 --> 3673.92
but it's not coming from a physical

3672.0 --> 3677.359
object like a lamp

3673.92 --> 3679.52
and that is my vantage point in

3677.359 --> 3681.7599999999998
figuring out how the heavenly bodies

3679.52 --> 3684.839
work the luminaries

3681.76 --> 3688.4
and cross-referencing everything

3684.839 --> 3689.44
everything with that vantage point

3688.4 --> 3693.2000000000003
framework

3689.44 --> 3696.839
and it's working out fantastically

3693.2 --> 3698.24
like i really feel like i'm this

3696.839 --> 3700.4
inter-dimensional

3698.24 --> 3703.5989999999997
treasure seeker and i'm trying to find

3700.4 --> 3706.799
something unbelievably complicated

3703.599 --> 3708.559
and i'm doing it it's working

3706.799 --> 3709.839
all the obstacles that have held

3708.559 --> 3713.599
everybody else back

3709.839 --> 3714.799
i've overcome them like really overcome

3713.599 --> 3717.92
them

3714.799 --> 3720.96
so it's interesting to see if it will

3717.92 --> 3720.96
eventually lead

3721.039 --> 3726.48
to truly figuring out

3724.16 --> 3727.68
how what what they are and how they are

3726.48 --> 3730.799
manifesting

3727.68 --> 3730.799
the celestial lights

3730.96 --> 3741.839
other than by god's design

3734.48 --> 3741.839
because that much seems as sure

3744.96 --> 3749.92
video or salt water and magnet produce

3747.92 --> 3755.839
electricity for a light bulb

3749.92 --> 3755.839
uh yeah well that's basic battery right

3787.44 --> 3797.839
okay william double j

3798.559 --> 3804.3190000000004
you should really try to uh check your

3802.079 --> 3808.48
grammar before you hit enter that

3804.319 --> 3810.72
that sentence is very sloppy

3808.48 --> 3825.839
it's hard to make out exactly what

3810.72 --> 3825.839
you're saying

3843.68 --> 3848.24
right i don't know about any flat earth

3845.76 --> 3848.2400000000002
clubs

3848.96 --> 3853.359
i don't even know like if there are any

3851.599 --> 3856.4
flat earthers here

3853.359 --> 3860.64
in this city at all

3856.4 --> 3862.88
i'm not getting contacted by any of them

3860.64 --> 3867.7599999999998
although yeah the last guy that i did

3862.88 --> 3871.119
know what was his name again

3867.76 --> 3873.599
it's been a long time yeah he moved to

3871.119 --> 3873.599
arnhem

3873.76 --> 3876.7990000000004
that was an awesome guy also yeah i met

3875.599 --> 3878.839
him at the

3876.799 --> 3880.16
flat earth conference in amsterdam in

3878.839 --> 3884.16
2019

3880.16 --> 3888.8799999999997
what's his name again great guy

3884.16 --> 3888.8799999999997
i met him like met him face to face too

3889.119 --> 3895.839
here in utrecht

3898.24 --> 3900.4799999999996
uh

3904.4 --> 3910.88
oh yeah i killed the hope that's right

3908.4 --> 3914.079
that guy i haven't seen him in a while

3910.88 --> 3914.079
he's probably very busy

3914.799 --> 3920.48
he has a family and he's like a park

3918.4 --> 3922.559
ranger now over in arnhem so

3920.48 --> 3924.0
yeah that should be crushing it totally

3922.559 --> 3927.6800000000003
logos

3924.0 --> 3937.839
really nice super patient guy

3927.68 --> 3937.839
a lot of good spirit

3939.2 --> 3951.839
john levi has some great stuff i don't

3941.44 --> 3951.839
know who that is

3957.76 --> 3966.7200000000003
about troll

3961.599 --> 3970.1600000000003
tries to troll no william double j

3966.72 --> 3973.2799999999997
i don't think he's a troll

3970.16 --> 3977.68
i just think he's very poor at grammar

3973.28 --> 3980.1600000000003
choose the 11 me however is a troll

3977.68 --> 3992.48
and he can get the [ __ ] out with your

3980.16 --> 3995.44
sock account

3992.48 --> 3995.44
jburss

3996.319 --> 3999.119
never heard of it

4004.559 --> 4008.559
right yeah to be honest i in the past

4008.0 --> 4010.559
had some

4008.559 --> 4011.8390000000004
really messed up experiences here in

4010.559 --> 4014.96
utrecht like

4011.839 --> 4018.0
really creepy i've had some

4014.96 --> 4020.64
like really weird like

4018.0 --> 4021.44
walk living switches to dark world

4020.64 --> 4024.799
experiences

4021.44 --> 4026.96
well arguably full-blown hallucinations

4024.799 --> 4029.839
in between normal experience

4026.96 --> 4035.68
here in utrecht so there's some really

4029.839 --> 4039.599
creepy [ __ ] that i experienced here

4035.68 --> 4042.5589999999997
like really freaky

4039.599 --> 4043.119
and i don't look it up i don't go there

4042.559 --> 4046.2400000000002
where i

4043.119 --> 4048.079
where i originally can trace that the

4046.24 --> 4050.4799999999996
route kind of started like i'm not even

4048.079 --> 4053.2000000000003
going to point anybody at that

4050.48 --> 4054.0
that's some weird experiences here

4053.2 --> 4057.4399999999996
yarbours

4054.0 --> 4057.44
no oh

4057.599 --> 4063.839
right yeah i've been there a couple of

4061.68 --> 4063.839
times

4064.079 --> 4069.039
i used to go there a couple of times way

4066.16 --> 4072.72
back in the 90s

4069.039 --> 4076.88
or post-90s when there was like a

4072.72 --> 4079.9199999999996
uh a card trading convention

4076.88 --> 4084.48
that trade magikarts

4079.92 --> 4084.48
i remember that that's a long time ago

4084.96 --> 4088.559
what about red bricks able to hold and

4086.96 --> 4091.599
store electricity like battery

4088.559 --> 4092.559
what i've never heard of that rasta hat

4091.599 --> 4098.400000000001
that sounds

4092.559 --> 4102.64
bizarre like an indoor event right yes

4098.4 --> 4105.839
it's just this huge hall huge

4102.64 --> 4105.839
like a

4107.839 --> 4112.0
like a warehouse sized hall

4112.159 --> 4116.839
with a roof that is built for all kinds

4114.96 --> 4121.92
of conventions and

4116.839 --> 4121.92
like specialist markets

4122.08 --> 4127.199
market and convention events that's

4125.279 --> 4133.839000000001
typically what they do

4127.199 --> 4133.839
at the yarbers

4137.92 --> 4141.679
it's a pretty epic place meh

4143.12 --> 4151.759
i'm not too big a fan of just oversized

4147.359 --> 4151.759
places and oversized events

4153.04 --> 4157.759
i like more cozy events small

4158.239 --> 4161.759
as i used to like to go to parties like

4160.719 --> 4164.64
at places where

4161.759 --> 4166.159
literally no more than 60 people would

4164.64 --> 4169.1990000000005
fit in there

4166.159 --> 4172.4
those are kind of like the the times

4169.199 --> 4174.879999999999
where i had the most fun

4172.4 --> 4177.679
where i it would also be much easier to

4174.88 --> 4180.08
basically contact

4177.679 --> 4181.04
new people that way if it's all too

4180.08 --> 4184.239
massive

4181.04 --> 4186.96
it all just gets lost in the soup

4184.239 --> 4188.159
and then i don't socialize at all that's

4186.96 --> 4191.04
what happens

4188.159 --> 4191.04
with me anyway

4200.32 --> 4208.639999999999
john levi showed it on his channel

4203.36 --> 4208.639999999999
in all diagrams what what did he show

4208.8 --> 4213.679
red the the red bricks holding

4210.96 --> 4213.679
electricity

4214.84 --> 4217.84
okay

4230.48 --> 4233.669999999999
[Music]

4235.92 --> 4242.159
all right well i did some testing

4239.52 --> 4245.120000000001
myself back in the day with the concept

4242.159 --> 4249.44
of crystal batteries

4245.12 --> 4253.5199999999995
like i made some like a setup

4249.44 --> 4256.0
that would literally continually produce

4253.52 --> 4257.679
very small amounts of electrical charge

4256.0 --> 4260.719
it was very small though

4257.679 --> 4265.04
never really perfected it

4260.719 --> 4265.04
kind of ran out of patience and funding

4269.04 --> 4273.36
and i like got to meet my ex-girlfriend

4271.6 --> 4275.6
and then kind of lost

4273.36 --> 4277.199
the patience entirely to do any of that

4275.6 --> 4279.360000000001
and hang around with with a bunch of

4277.199 --> 4282.239
weirdos

4279.36 --> 4283.36
which they were still nice weirdos but

4282.239 --> 4285.678999999999
yeah

4283.36 --> 4288.08
they're also weird alien worshippers and

4285.679 --> 4292.96
[ __ ] there so

4288.08 --> 4294.96
but uh yeah i've done some myself so yes

4292.96 --> 4297.92
there is just the charge

4294.96 --> 4298.56
it's it's atmospheric very likely but

4297.92 --> 4300.4
also

4298.56 --> 4303.360000000001
one thing i noticed with my crystal

4300.4 --> 4307.199
battery that i made the very minor thing

4303.36 --> 4308.5599999999995
little test is that if you got closer to

4307.199 --> 4312.0
power lines

4308.56 --> 4315.6
and that place where i built that was

4312.0 --> 4318.64
actually underneath power lines right

4315.6 --> 4321.76
that it would produce more electricity

4318.64 --> 4322.400000000001
so these power lines also just have a

4321.76 --> 4325.4400000000005
lot of

4322.4 --> 4327.28
excess electrical waste energy

4325.44 --> 4329.36
they dump in the air surrounding them

4327.28 --> 4331.679
and the crystal battery would literally

4329.36 --> 4333.759999999999
pick it up

4331.679 --> 4335.52
so i varied it like went away from the

4333.76 --> 4338.96
lines then the charge would

4335.52 --> 4340.56
die down significantly to almost nothing

4338.96 --> 4343.84
then i got closer again and it would

4340.56 --> 4343.84
pick it up

4344.0 --> 4348.239
that's the one thing kind of that i

4345.6 --> 4348.2390000000005
learned about it

4348.719 --> 4354.56
that also made me take proximity to

4352.4 --> 4357.199
power lines a lot more serious

4354.56 --> 4358.64
like there is energy that it just dumps

4357.199 --> 4362.639999999999
in the surrounding

4358.64 --> 4362.64
it has an influence it's literally

4368.84 --> 4374.32
measurable

4370.48 --> 4385.839999999999
quartz indeed i used quartz

4374.32 --> 4385.84
in my crystal battery

4411.6 --> 4417.280000000001
right oh well conceivably

4415.36 --> 4419.5199999999995
if you take all of that into account you

4417.28 --> 4426.96
could probably make some very serious

4419.52 --> 4428.88
dynamos using quartz

4426.96 --> 4430.159
and not just magnets right because

4428.88 --> 4433.28
standard dynamos

4430.159 --> 4435.36
are used with magnets

4433.28 --> 4437.5199999999995
rolling past each other and then just

4435.36 --> 4439.599999999999
the switch

4437.52 --> 4442.2390000000005
the magnetic influence actually causes a

4439.6 --> 4445.4400000000005
charge passively

4442.239 --> 4447.919999999999
you could probably try something similar

4445.44 --> 4449.919999999999
with quartz

4447.92 --> 4452.4
i don't know if it would be better or

4449.92 --> 4455.84
different type of charge

4452.4 --> 4455.839999999999
who knows

4480.84 --> 4483.84
hmm

4494.84 --> 4501.28
so

4496.56 --> 4501.280000000001
people generate the earth's electricity

4504.08 --> 4513.44
well no

4510.0 --> 4516.4
we have a charge but that is not

4513.44 --> 4518.239
the charge that encompasses the entire

4516.4 --> 4522.5599999999995
world

4518.239 --> 4524.879999999999
our charge is probably secondary

4522.56 --> 4525.76
there is a primary charge one could

4524.88 --> 4528.8
argue

4525.76 --> 4529.76
it is god right it is not a hard jump to

4528.8 --> 4532.08
make

4529.76 --> 4534.0
like the creator there is this

4532.08 --> 4539.199
overarching

4534.0 --> 4541.84
energy field electric ether

4539.199 --> 4544.4
what is generating that we don't know we

4541.84 --> 4546.8
just know there are things

4544.4 --> 4549.12
within it that are also generating their

4546.8 --> 4552.08
own electricity

4549.12 --> 4554.32
it's not hard to conceive that the

4552.08 --> 4557.5199999999995
electric ether

4554.32 --> 4559.92
allows probably

4557.52 --> 4561.76
the the smaller things to also generate

4559.92 --> 4567.84
their own electricity

4561.76 --> 4567.84
or like tap into that arguably

4597.6 --> 4603.120000000001
potato can i like yeah it can generate

4600.08 --> 4609.84
electricity i heard

4603.12 --> 4609.84
potato battery

4610.08 --> 4614.239
i wonder how that would work with a

4611.92 --> 4618.159
potato if they were still

4614.239 --> 4618.879999999999
in the ground like if they were still

4618.159 --> 4622.32
attached

4618.88 --> 4625.52
to the plant could you actually

4622.32 --> 4628.88
use living plants continually as an

4625.52 --> 4629.92
electric power source and that they

4628.88 --> 4632.96
wouldn't die of it

4629.92 --> 4633.92
that's important to find out for the

4632.96 --> 4637.84
test like

4633.92 --> 4641.679
same region same plants

4637.84 --> 4644.32
same age test it out when you tap it for

4641.679 --> 4645.92
electricity does that detract from the

4644.32 --> 4648.719
plant

4645.92 --> 4649.52
or literally it doesn't matter it's not

4648.719 --> 4653.04
in the way

4649.52 --> 4654.64
that would be interesting thing to know

4653.04 --> 4656.56
because if you're just gonna take a

4654.64 --> 4658.320000000001
picked potato yeah that thing

4656.56 --> 4660.2390000000005
doesn't live forever it's gonna

4658.32 --> 4665.199
eventually dry out die out

4660.239 --> 4667.759999999999
right but i don't know

4665.199 --> 4669.44
if it's still attached to the roots of

4667.76 --> 4672.719
the plant

4669.44 --> 4676.32
could you then like a pin just go get it

4672.719 --> 4677.199
find a potato still dug in put a pin in

4676.32 --> 4679.28
it

4677.199 --> 4682.08
cover it up perhaps and then there would

4679.28 --> 4684.08
be electricity coming from it

4682.08 --> 4686.32
and then how long would that last how

4684.08 --> 4688.5599999999995
long would that keep functioning

4686.32 --> 4689.92
would that specific potato still attach

4688.56 --> 4693.6
to the root

4689.92 --> 4697.12
start go rotting or die or shrivel

4693.6 --> 4697.120000000001
while the other ones not

4697.28 --> 4702.96
not connected to an electrode

4700.4 --> 4707.839999999999
wouldn't these are interesting things to

4702.96 --> 4707.84
find out

4718.84 --> 4721.84
so

4735.44 --> 4739.5199999999995
yeah that's that's a funny one matthias

4738.239 --> 4743.04
the walking witness yeah

4739.52 --> 4743.4400000000005
yeah earth you can rearrange the letters

4743.04 --> 4749.84
to

4743.44 --> 4749.839999999999
ma to mean heart that's right

4750.96 --> 4755.52
it's even as simple as you take the h at

4753.44 --> 4757.919999999999
the end and stick it on front and there

4755.52 --> 4757.92
you go

4759.28 --> 4766.239
so if you put the word earth

4762.48 --> 4768.239
directly beside itself without a space

4766.239 --> 4777.839999999999
or the word heart it's gonna look

4768.239 --> 4777.839999999999
exactly the same

4788.84 --> 4791.84
hmm

4830.84 --> 4833.84
so

4851.28 --> 4855.5199999999995
all right okay georgetown it's not the

4852.96 --> 4859.679
potato it's the dissimilar metals

4855.52 --> 4862.88
so by that standard it means

4859.679 --> 4865.76
what plane cross

4862.88 --> 4866.639
okay but by that standard it would mean

4865.76 --> 4868.88
that

4866.639 --> 4869.76
you just have you don't need life you

4868.88 --> 4872.84
just need

4869.76 --> 4875.76
the dissimilar metals you just need

4872.84 --> 4877.52
something

4875.76 --> 4879.679
something that has the right metal

4877.52 --> 4889.84
components

4879.679 --> 4889.84
i guess

4892.32 --> 4902.08
potato is the liquid for conduction

4894.32 --> 4904.96
right makes sense

4902.08 --> 4905.6
right but the difference is with of

4904.96 --> 4908.639
course

4905.6 --> 4909.76
when you have a man-made battery once

4908.639 --> 4911.84
it's produced

4909.76 --> 4913.679
it's it doesn't change except for

4911.84 --> 4916.88
entropy it degrades

4913.679 --> 4918.0
perhaps but a potato is part of a living

4916.88 --> 4922.08
organism that

4918.0 --> 4924.639
literally produces the aspects of it

4922.08 --> 4931.84
continually

4924.639 --> 4931.84
so i don't know

4944.48 --> 4948.638999999999
try cell battery made with copper and

4946.4 --> 4951.839999999999
tin yeah yeah

4948.639 --> 4953.4400000000005
well that's what i used i used exact

4951.84 --> 4957.04
well i used aluminum

4953.44 --> 4960.799999999999
and copper and

4957.04 --> 4960.8
yeah uh quartz crystal

4963.04 --> 4969.679
and sand like it's very fine white sand

4967.04 --> 4970.4
that it's already like a quartz type of

4969.679 --> 4974.159
sand

4970.4 --> 4976.08
i used that for my crystal battery

4974.159 --> 4978.638999999999
i still have it somewhere i don't know

4976.08 --> 4978.639
where though

4980.08 --> 4987.84
probably in storage

5013.679 --> 5015.84
hmm

5048.159 --> 5052.4
all right well charlie welch i'm sorry

5051.12 --> 5055.199
if this is all too

5052.4 --> 5058.08
low down for you but i'm just discussing

5055.199 --> 5058.08
whatever comes up

5058.4 --> 5064.799999999999
so somewhat earlier i i discussed the

5062.56 --> 5066.159000000001
more complicated nature of the celestial

5064.8 --> 5071.12
lights

5066.159 --> 5072.96
right talked about that back then

5071.12 --> 5075.679
hey if you if you if you got something

5072.96 --> 5079.28
better to insert

5075.679 --> 5081.679
that has some root to it right go ahead

5079.28 --> 5085.04
you're here right instead of just

5081.679 --> 5088.0
complaining about something

5085.04 --> 5090.8
you could insert the subject you like to

5088.0 --> 5090.8
have discussed

5091.28 --> 5101.5199999999995
how about that

5099.76 --> 5103.360000000001
do all living things have electricity

5101.52 --> 5104.88
running through them yes matthias the

5103.36 --> 5113.839999999999
walking witness i'm pretty sure

5104.88 --> 5113.84
everything does

5143.12 --> 5147.92
what tesla coils spaced apart taking

5146.48 --> 5150.959999999999
free energy no that's

5147.92 --> 5154.0
that's not true right

5150.96 --> 5156.56
tesla coils the high

5154.0 --> 5157.44
tension the high voltage level

5156.56 --> 5161.04
electricity

5157.44 --> 5161.599999999999
how that works yes there is a lossless

5161.04 --> 5165.36
or

5161.6 --> 5168.4800000000005
maybe near and lossless transfer

5165.36 --> 5171.12
of the electricity through the air that

5168.48 --> 5171.44
electricity was not just there it had to

5171.12 --> 5174.4
be

5171.44 --> 5175.36
generated right it's not like oh you

5174.4 --> 5177.44
build a tower

5175.36 --> 5180.5599999999995
and then suddenly it starts sparking

5177.44 --> 5183.599999999999
just just the way it is without any

5180.56 --> 5186.159000000001
electrical input no still had to

5183.6 --> 5191.1990000000005
actually generate the electricity

5186.159 --> 5191.199
right it's no free energy

5191.28 --> 5198.5599999999995
tesla's approach simply was

5194.4 --> 5202.32
more efficient energy

5198.56 --> 5205.360000000001
more lossless

5202.32 --> 5208.48
right and

5205.36 --> 5210.0
not measurable it's you can't

5208.48 --> 5225.839999999999
you can't bill it that's why they

5210.0 --> 5225.84
discarded him

5229.28 --> 5236.08
coiled transfer of third voltage

5232.88 --> 5236.08
i don't know what that means

5236.719 --> 5240.8
i just know there is electrical

5239.12 --> 5245.36
transference

5240.8 --> 5248.56
possible tesla tested it successfully

5245.36 --> 5252.0
very successfully it worked great

5248.56 --> 5256.639
was complete yeah very efficient needed

5252.0 --> 5259.52
very little energy input to keep going

5256.639 --> 5262.159000000001
didn't have a lot of entropy effects on

5259.52 --> 5262.159000000001
the equipment

5262.56 --> 5281.84
right it's an efficient system there

5264.8 --> 5281.84
still had to be electrical input

5292.639 --> 5297.12
i like energy from the air with graphene

5294.88 --> 5297.12
wire

5299.52 --> 5304.0
that's interesting oh yeah maybe maybe

5302.88 --> 5306.56
that's possible with

5304.0 --> 5307.44
like big antennas you could pick up

5306.56 --> 5309.84
something some

5307.44 --> 5309.839999999999
charge

5313.84 --> 5317.04
i don't think that is what tesla was

5315.76 --> 5320.159000000001
doing though but

5317.04 --> 5321.36
hey i might be mistaken to be fair i

5320.159 --> 5325.28
never completely

5321.36 --> 5325.28
memorized all the literature of his

5325.36 --> 5331.92
maybe he did eventually like take a

5328.4 --> 5331.92
a electric tower

5332.159 --> 5337.679
and then really tapped into the air

5335.36 --> 5339.92
defeated its power

5337.679 --> 5341.28
i don't know i don't think so though i

5339.92 --> 5351.84
think it was still just

5341.28 --> 5351.84
fed by an electric generator

5367.28 --> 5371.679
right yeah but george sanford then you

5369.76 --> 5373.84
know every time you think about that

5371.679 --> 5374.8
it's like oh yeah let's just put

5373.84 --> 5378.88
antennas

5374.8 --> 5381.52
up everywhere for our electricity

5378.88 --> 5383.12
right well that electricity is still

5381.52 --> 5385.120000000001
going to come from somewhere

5383.12 --> 5388.5599999999995
it's going to be tapped into and that's

5385.12 --> 5388.5599999999995
going to detract it so

5391.04 --> 5398.239
yeah there may be a risk

5394.4 --> 5399.839999999999
to over using tapping into ether

5398.239 --> 5402.959999999999
electric

5399.84 --> 5406.08
energy in the air

5402.96 --> 5408.08
if too many tap into it that may have a

5406.08 --> 5410.239
direct influence i don't know on the

5408.08 --> 5412.32
weather on the celestials

5410.239 --> 5415.599999999999
the celestial output it could have all

5412.32 --> 5415.599999999999
kinds of consequences

5416.32 --> 5423.599999999999
so like

5419.679 --> 5425.1990000000005
that should never truly be a universal

5423.6 --> 5428.400000000001
standard and like oh

5425.199 --> 5430.4
we're not allowed to

5428.4 --> 5432.5599999999995
generate electricity anymore you can

5430.4 --> 5434.4
only have electricity if you tap it out

5432.56 --> 5448.2390000000005
of the air well that would yield

5434.4 --> 5451.599999999999
probably a disastrous result

5448.239 --> 5457.04
it's already done power lines everywhere

5451.6 --> 5457.04
tied to resonant just generally what

5460.84 --> 5463.84
what

5466.159 --> 5472.5599999999995
so you're saying that they already tap

5469.44 --> 5474.839999999999
into atmospherics to basically keep the

5472.56 --> 5478.080000000001
power strong

5474.84 --> 5479.84
in in the generators or in the power

5478.08 --> 5481.44
lines because there is a lot of

5479.84 --> 5485.1990000000005
electrical loss

5481.44 --> 5489.5199999999995
in the power line system because of

5485.199 --> 5491.28
because of the voltage the lower voltage

5489.52 --> 5492.719
there's a lot of loss a lot of entropy

5491.28 --> 5494.639
hey even

5492.719 --> 5496.96
enough to be picked up by a crystal

5494.639 --> 5498.8
battery in proximity to it

5496.96 --> 5501.04
it's a lot of energy waste so yeah i

5498.8 --> 5503.76
wouldn't be surprised if they

5501.04 --> 5504.32
put some amplifiers on there here and

5503.76 --> 5507.52
there

5504.32 --> 5510.5599999999995
using a atmospheric electricity to

5507.52 --> 5510.56
juice it back up

5510.719 --> 5519.84
could be i don't know

5526.8 --> 5531.679
there's a reason those why those giant

5529.36 --> 5535.839999999999
trees were cut oh really

5531.679 --> 5535.84
which which giant trees were those

5542.4 --> 5549.599999999999
if you're referencing to no trees

5546.4 --> 5553.5199999999995
from a while ago yeah that that's highly

5549.6 --> 5554.88
disputed right nobody's ever actually

5553.52 --> 5558.080000000001
witnessed that

5554.88 --> 5560.400000000001
yes there were some really huge massive

5558.08 --> 5564.159
trees cut down

5560.4 --> 5564.96
in the united states but yeah those are

5564.159 --> 5567.12
not

5564.96 --> 5567.12
like

5568.639 --> 5572.0
50 miles across right those are just

5571.6 --> 5575.120000000001
like

5572.0 --> 5575.679
maybe five five meters or 10 meters

5575.12 --> 5579.04
across

5575.679 --> 5583.12
really big but not

5579.04 --> 5586.4
those huge like world-sized trees

5583.12 --> 5588.4
right nobody's has any proof of that if

5586.4 --> 5592.159
that happened it happened way

5588.4 --> 5593.679
before like in the atlantean or

5592.159 --> 5595.92
pre-atlantean age

5593.679 --> 5599.04
before the flood there's no way they

5595.92 --> 5599.04
were around after it

5600.08 --> 5603.679
do i have my own discord server yes i do

5602.719 --> 5605.36
technically

5603.679 --> 5607.52
but i haven't really done anything with

5605.36 --> 5607.5199999999995
it

5611.52 --> 5617.84
it is out there though

5634.32 --> 5645.84
okay george sanford sure fine

5670.84 --> 5673.84
uh

5677.14 --> 5680.299
[Music]

5697.76 --> 5701.6
right yeah clutch bear david weiss does

5700.8 --> 5704.0
have a video

5701.6 --> 5704.639
does did mirror that video it's still in

5704.0 --> 5706.96
there

5704.639 --> 5709.4400000000005
a lot of people did i didn't but i was

5706.96 --> 5715.6
very interested

5709.44 --> 5718.32
and it also kindled my deeper

5715.6 --> 5719.360000000001
the the process the yeah also dark world

5718.32 --> 5722.88
related

5719.36 --> 5724.159
to figure out like what what the ancient

5722.88 --> 5726.159000000001
past really was like

5724.159 --> 5728.0
and like how it would arrange itself in

5726.159 --> 5729.92
phases from a biblical

5728.0 --> 5731.36
standpoint but with the view that

5729.92 --> 5734.0
probably

5731.36 --> 5735.759999999999
there's more or a different type of

5734.0 --> 5738.32
angle to it

5735.76 --> 5739.84
and i made my own hangouts about that

5738.32 --> 5740.4
but they were part of the flat earth

5739.84 --> 5742.400000000001
talks

5740.4 --> 5745.679
it that it's that long ago it's like

5742.4 --> 5745.679
four years ago or something

5748.719 --> 5757.84
let me see we can find them

5769.679 --> 5772.2390000000005
what the

5778.639 --> 5785.84
hold on where is it

5792.08 --> 5797.199
right the show's

5795.199 --> 5799.678999999999
car were called flatter talks the

5797.199 --> 5802.799999999999
atlantean age in the fall of the giants

5799.679 --> 5807.28
flatter talks the most ancient times

5802.8 --> 5810.400000000001
and flatter talks the age of illusions

5807.28 --> 5812.5599999999995
within the flatter talks playlist

5810.4 --> 5815.119
so yeah check them out that's a long

5812.56 --> 5815.119000000001
time ago

5815.52 --> 5819.4400000000005
but most of it is pretty much unchanged

5818.4 --> 5821.92
i haven't really

5819.44 --> 5822.48
tapped into it a lot you know i've just

5821.92 --> 5826.32
been

5822.48 --> 5829.759999999999
doing more wider studies

5826.32 --> 5829.759999999999
more pondering on it

5837.84 --> 5855.84
i'll be back in two minutes and then i'm

5839.6 --> 5855.84
gonna round out the show

5950.84 --> 5953.84
huh

5968.639 --> 5974.400000000001
ah george sanford but that's just the

5970.719 --> 5978.4
fractal nature of creation itself

5974.4 --> 5980.32
crystalline yeah not even the fractal

5978.4 --> 5982.159
nature is difficult

5980.32 --> 5984.48
it's more conceptual that's more like

5982.159 --> 5986.32
the spirit

5984.48 --> 5987.678999999999
how the spirit works how information

5986.32 --> 5991.92
works

5987.679 --> 5995.28
but the crystalline nature

5991.92 --> 5997.679
of matter that's really why these

5995.28 --> 5999.92
patterns are so reoccurring in nature

5997.679 --> 6002.32
it's even said like in nature that

5999.92 --> 6004.96
includes life but it also includes

6002.32 --> 6004.96
non-life

6006.84 --> 6009.84
crystals

6028.719 --> 6036.2390000000005
oh from earth energy no

6032.48 --> 6039.36
no it's crystalline george sanford

6036.239 --> 6039.36
that's not the energy

6039.6 --> 6046.159000000001
it's how matter arranges itself

6043.92 --> 6048.159
and with it like how the tensions within

6046.159 --> 6049.679
it are arranged and they're also

6048.159 --> 6052.4
therefore also

6049.679 --> 6052.88
when other external tension put on top

6052.4 --> 6055.92
of it

6052.88 --> 6055.92
how it would crack

6056.08 --> 6065.84
the patterns so

6059.28 --> 6065.84
it's all crystalline

6089.679 --> 6094.56
it takes energy to make crystal well it

6092.0 --> 6096.719
takes energy to have matter

6094.56 --> 6098.8
right but then you're gonna go into like

6096.719 --> 6101.92
the existential

6098.8 --> 6107.04
the physics existentialism

6101.92 --> 6111.28
yeah matter requires energy sure

6107.04 --> 6113.119
but that doesn't mean yeah just because

6111.28 --> 6115.119
that arrangement doesn't mean that you

6113.119 --> 6118.08
can just say okay that means

6115.119 --> 6119.199
everything is energy right that's what

6118.08 --> 6123.5199999999995
the ballers do

6119.199 --> 6126.08
is what the controllers

6123.52 --> 6127.1990000000005
force on us that's how they said no

6126.08 --> 6130.639
everything

6127.199 --> 6131.36
is matter and light and matter is just

6130.639 --> 6134.719
light

6131.36 --> 6138.0
slowed down right that comes from that

6134.719 --> 6138.96
over generalized unification of all

6138.0 --> 6142.56
things

6138.96 --> 6145.04
which is completely nonsensical

6142.56 --> 6146.639
right a fractal pattern might be based

6145.04 --> 6149.36
on a pattern

6146.639 --> 6151.1990000000005
but every part of the fractal is the way

6149.36 --> 6155.199
it is

6151.199 --> 6155.199
it's not just the pattern

6156.0 --> 6159.36
it's manifesting through the pattern

6158.4 --> 6162.4
that doesn't make

6159.36 --> 6177.839999999999
it the pattern the manifestation just is

6162.4 --> 6177.839999999999
guided by the pattern

6198.56 --> 6208.159000000001
right so i'm rounding out the show

6204.56 --> 6208.159000000001
just called anyway

6215.6 --> 6219.52
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6217.92 --> 6220.0
liked the show i thought it was really

6219.52 --> 6223.679
good

6220.0 --> 6227.6
very very detailed

6223.679 --> 6229.52
i like that if you like this show too

patreon crypto wallet super chat and the

6247.04 --> 6251.5199999999995
membership system join button

6249.04 --> 6252.8
that'll be much appreciated yeah please

6261.6 --> 6267.159000000001
uh right i will be back tomorrow with

6264.88 --> 6269.84
flat earth early bird number

6267.159 --> 6270.96
891 on the wednesday and i'm gonna join

6269.84 --> 6274.4800000000005
the flat earth debates

6270.96 --> 6279.6
which should start up any minute now

6274.48 --> 6279.599999999999
until the next video make it

6280.66 --> 6289.84
[Music]

6286.84 --> 6289.84
flat

6290.8 --> 6303.84
[Music]

6300.84 --> 6303.84
so

6304.27 --> 6311.399
[Music]

6326.0 --> 6328.08
you
