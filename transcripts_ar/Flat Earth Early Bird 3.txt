1.84 --> 11.09
good morning hello this is Arwen

7.549 --> 19.52
welcome to the Flat Earth early-bird

11.09 --> 24.23
Show episode 3 yeah

19.52 --> 30.13
today I have two guests with me William

24.23 --> 34.13
music freak MC and Eric boshane welcome

30.13 --> 36.86
hey guys morning it was Eric you still

34.13 --> 39.290000000000006
there yeah I'm here so sorry I mean

36.86 --> 43.01
little these are still mute

39.29 --> 47.329
yeah I can hear you mmm

43.01 --> 49.489
it may be afk or something anyway yeah

47.329 --> 54.59
before the stove show you even started

49.489 --> 57.98
already and started off so let's just do

54.59 --> 60.59
a little repeat about the subjects we

57.98 --> 65.2
were talking about we're talking about

60.59 --> 67.61
natural law and also about the

65.2 --> 70.85000000000001
interpretation of the natural world in

67.61 --> 75.049
the scientific method which are very

70.85 --> 79.49
controversial subjects both of them so

75.049 --> 82.58000000000001
yeah you want to get into it again well

79.49 --> 84.35
let's how about I just um just for the

82.58 --> 89.329
sake of it I run through a few minutes

84.35 --> 91.03999999999999
of a presentation or we can read it do

89.329 --> 92.72
you want to broadcast a YouTube video

91.04 --> 95.47
with audio or how does that work it

92.72 --> 101.24
seems like it doesn't usually work well

95.47 --> 102.89
depends it depends on how long it is you

101.24 --> 105.53
can send it to you and I can present it

102.89 --> 107.659
that's no problem yeah I just don't know

105.53 --> 109.31
if you know sharing the audio or just

107.659 --> 111.95
going through the seems like sometimes

109.31 --> 117.049
when you present a video the with audio

111.95 --> 119.06
it um well should I present you know

117.049 --> 121.79
it's different in Nathan's hangout

119.06 --> 124.49000000000001
because then the volume is all funneled

121.79 --> 127.64
and panel members don't have their

124.49 --> 130.039
volume up but this is a director hangout

127.64 --> 131.959
so it might work a lot better here okay

130.039 --> 134.939
well since I have it up then I'll just

131.959 --> 139.109
try so let me present

134.939 --> 145.26
I'm not gonna play the whole a nice

139.109 --> 147.74900000000002
Tasman okay good boy Indians morning and

145.26 --> 150.53
by the way this is not a flat earth

147.749 --> 156.2
related or really scientific related

150.53 --> 156.2
video or topic but it kind of connects

157.31 --> 168.079
okay this is eating a lot of memory okay

162.78 --> 168.079
am i presenting let's see I hold on

168.65 --> 175.859
again though

171.75 --> 178.379
hello video and I just said David up

175.859 --> 179.18900000000002
David who left about to link to Skype

178.379 --> 187.019
with you as well

179.189 --> 189.84
enjoying what's what's sorry say again I

187.019 --> 191.489
just said David read so he can doing the

189.84 --> 195.65
show alright

191.489 --> 198.449
yeah yes if he wants to join that's

195.65 --> 200.549
absolutely the link I'll set up your

198.449 --> 202.40900000000002
hangout to you so I can go we're on all

200.549 --> 207.449
right or if he wants to join you can

202.409 --> 211.019
join absolutely fine right so yeah Eric

207.449 --> 215.489
you're presenting okay so true solution

211.019 --> 217.019
natural all yeah just just give it I

215.489 --> 220.62
think it's about two three men you put

217.019 --> 226.769
it to full screen or large screen at

220.62 --> 228.75
least better alright okay let's give it

226.769 --> 231.989
a test on the audio and see if it works

228.75 --> 235.5
well if not then we can just like kind

231.989 --> 240.75
of discuss the text here okay so I

235.5 --> 244.379
understand okay you any many paths to

240.75 --> 247.199
freedom and spirituality Baha Eric UN

244.379 --> 248.75
presented I'm sorry you have

247.199 --> 253.62
unpresentable

248.75 --> 257.039
in in it okay exit don't zoom don't do

253.62 --> 259.019
just it's a video writer so maybe it's

257.039 --> 261.419
full screen yeah that's excellent

259.019 --> 263.94
perfect okay how was the audio yeah I

261.419 --> 267.81
could hear something so okay just want

263.94 --> 272.19
to make sure it's dry but it's audible

267.81 --> 274.71
okay how long is it maybe that statement

272.19 --> 276.96
mr. Bennett yes they can get you to an

274.71 --> 281.07
understanding of what the solution is

276.96 --> 283.28999999999996
but there's only one real-time solution

281.07 --> 285.84
and this can sound dogmatic that people

283.29 --> 287.97
can even sound religious to people and I

285.84 --> 290.669
kind of explain to people in all my work

287.97 --> 292.65000000000003
I'm not dogmatic I'm not religious to

290.669 --> 294.59999999999997
say something to the effect of do you

292.65 --> 296.76
believe in natural law or do you think

294.6 --> 299.40000000000003
it's some type of religious dogma is as

296.76 --> 303.06
ridiculous as asking someone if they

299.4 --> 305.29999999999995
believe believe if I hold an object up

303.06 --> 307.86
and then let it go will it fall downward

305.3 --> 311.52000000000004
there's no dogma or religious belief

307.86 --> 316.2
required for that it's more in the

311.52 --> 318.51
universe well behavior is also bound by

316.2 --> 321.18
law this is the problem with the human

318.51 --> 323.64
ego though the human ego refuses to

321.18 --> 325.35
accept the behavior is down by law and

323.64 --> 328.34999999999997
we want to think we can do anything we

325.35 --> 330.47900000000004
want as long as we don't get caught the

328.35 --> 333.47900000000004
only solution is the understanding of

330.479 --> 337.08
natural law and how we are inextricably

333.479 --> 338.96999999999997
forever bound by it we can have we have

337.08 --> 341.19
free will to choose our behavior but we

338.97 --> 343.52000000000004
do not have free will to be insulated

341.19 --> 348.21
from the consequences of our choices in

343.52 --> 349.40999999999997
freewill is the most occulted

348.21 --> 352.89
information that needs to be understood

349.41 --> 355.86
by humanity and there is very little

352.89 --> 358.05
progress in propagating a worldwide

355.86 --> 358.77000000000004
understanding of natural law to the body

358.05 --> 362.07
of humanity

358.77 --> 363.69
that's what our work is oops that's what

362.07 --> 365.31
the work of the people in this room and

363.69 --> 367.31
the people who do understand this

365.31 --> 369.63
listening out there on the Internet is

367.31 --> 372.18
we have to become teachers of this

369.63 --> 376.2
information I'm naive we thought in my

372.18 --> 379.32
early days of them a step ahead law is a

376.2 --> 381.95
set of universal inherent objective not

379.32 --> 385.34999999999997
man-made eternal and immutable

381.95 --> 389.34
conditions which govern the consequences

385.35 --> 391.91900000000004
of behaviors of beings with the capacity

389.34 --> 395.96999999999997
for understanding the difference between

391.919 --> 398.13
a harmful and non harmful behavior that

395.97 --> 400.90000000000003
means it applies to intelligent beings

398.13 --> 404.46999999999997
who have developed brain and nerve

400.9 --> 406.81
system like we do okay it doesn't apply

404.47 --> 408.88000000000005
to lesser beings to the animal kingdom

406.81 --> 410.65
they don't they're not gonna sit there

408.88 --> 412.81
and reason we have the capacity for

410.65 --> 415.21
reason they're instinctual creatures

412.81 --> 417.039
they have emotions as well but we have

415.21 --> 419.73999999999995
higher thought functions

417.039 --> 422.02
that's why natural law applies to us the

419.74 --> 425.32
behavior laws of creation apply to

422.02 --> 426.96999999999997
humans and more advanced things because

425.32 --> 430.71999999999997
we have the capacity for understanding

426.97 --> 433.3
morality a worldwide common-sense

430.72 --> 434.97900000000004
understanding of true objective morality

433.3 --> 438.82
and the laws that govern behavior

434.979 --> 440.77
consequence is the only true solution to

438.82 --> 446.83
the current human condition of slavery

440.77 --> 449.5
for as long as humanity okay so so I

446.83 --> 451.57
think what is interesting let me go I

449.5 --> 453.37
can stop presenting and then well no I

451.57 --> 455.77
mean I don't know should I leave it up

453.37 --> 458.11
if anybody wants no is there anything

455.77 --> 460.0
more look good yeah this is what I mean

458.11 --> 462.849
this is a two-and-a-half-hour preempted

460.0 --> 464.86
yeah that's way too long but yeah you

462.849 --> 466.96
know I just wanted to because I find

464.86 --> 470.62
this interesting that he's breaking it

466.96 --> 472.19899999999996
apart from behavior you know we can call

470.62 --> 475.84000000000003
that the physical and we can call that

472.199 --> 478.21000000000004
experimenting science whatever but that

475.84 --> 482.26
he's saying that there that there is a

478.21 --> 485.53
supernatural which I think we were

482.26 --> 488.889
discussing and um II gave a good

485.53 --> 493.9
citation where the natural world was

488.889 --> 496.36
invented to separate the tangible that

493.9 --> 499.479
the world of man and nature everything

496.36 --> 501.40000000000003
from supernatural wasn't from science

499.479 --> 505.9
and technology just the things like God

501.4 --> 509.60999999999996
or Krishna or you know Mount Olympus and

505.9 --> 513.4789999999999
all these these ideas Valhalla whatever

509.61 --> 515.5
I don't what did what did what do you

513.479 --> 517.599
what did you do you have anything in

515.5 --> 520.99
this I win that you want to expand upon

517.599 --> 524.2900000000001
or uh hold on sorry I got this try

520.99 --> 525.97
somebody tried to call me inscribe it

524.29 --> 530.3199999999999
seems that this show is getting popular

525.97 --> 532.2090000000001
I guess sorry again you were referring

530.32 --> 534.1400000000001
to the scientific method I guess and

532.209 --> 536.81
well you know are they

534.14 --> 540.02
was talking about behavior right the

536.81 --> 544.63
behavioral codes just the natural law

540.02 --> 550.81
just like the law says right yeah I

544.63 --> 556.22
think that it is and grained in creation

550.81 --> 559.3399999999999
it is what I consider like God's law in

556.22 --> 562.01
the sense that you just know it works

559.34 --> 565.73
this way and if you doubt it or if you

562.01 --> 567.41
ignore it then yeah it will be fulfilled

565.73 --> 570.41
basically you will get the consequences

567.41 --> 573.5
and everything changes in a very

570.41 --> 574.04
specific pattern in how things respond

573.5 --> 580.06
to you

574.04 --> 582.7099999999999
so yes natural law I think it is

580.06 --> 584.66
ethereal I guess it's not really a

582.71 --> 587.3000000000001
physical thing that's to do with

584.66 --> 588.86
conscious like he described I thought

587.3 --> 592.6999999999999
the description in the video was very

588.86 --> 595.46
good and yeah I totally agree to it it's

592.7 --> 597.6500000000001
very basically well I always break it

595.46 --> 600.08
down in kind of uh I put it in an animal

597.65 --> 602.03
kingdom I look at you know lions or

600.08 --> 607.19
specifically lionesses the ones that

602.03 --> 609.3199999999999
hunt right so the lion will usually go

607.19 --> 614.6500000000001
after this small you know that the the

609.32 --> 617.63
calves or whatever they're called in and

614.65 --> 620.84
then the herd you know that they have

617.63 --> 622.9399999999999
horns they'll sometimes defend and mess

620.84 --> 625.3100000000001
up that lion and you know use we've all

622.94 --> 628.8100000000001
seen videos of life then limping away I

625.31 --> 628.81
just think that's a perfect

629.08 --> 634.25
visualization of natural law like okay

631.4 --> 636.74
lion is existing in nature trying to get

634.25 --> 639.44
to me they're not it's not really

636.74 --> 642.83
because the lines specifically are using

639.44 --> 645.2800000000001
it for food and that's that makes

642.83 --> 649.1600000000001
everything difference of course

645.28 --> 652.37
like weeds although I don't engage in

649.16 --> 654.68
that really well if we're if we're if we

652.37 --> 657.71
take away technology and we're mean man

654.68 --> 659.9
we'll have to resort to you know the the

657.71 --> 662.57
biggest vegan will probably resort to

659.9 --> 667.66
hunting too as well you know if they're

662.57 --> 671.6
in a cold Harmon climate I don't know

667.66 --> 676.67
we have technologies to basically create

671.6 --> 679.4
a aces in the middle of a winch in a

676.67 --> 680.87
snowy desert so no not necessarily

679.4 --> 687.35
anymore

680.87 --> 690.5
I think veganism is something that would

687.35 --> 693.01
have always benefited us but in previous

690.5 --> 697.13
ages we simply didn't have the

693.01 --> 701.51
technology to make it possible really

697.13 --> 703.52
without really sacrifice now there's so

701.51 --> 706.67
much technology there's so much new

703.52 --> 710.29
things that just allow it to come to

706.67 --> 715.01
fruition with always advantages I mean

710.29 --> 716.56
how do I stop where's everyone else

715.01 --> 721.88
everyone else is quiet

716.56 --> 725.51
I'd like some loot yeah maybe they're

721.88 --> 728.87
away from the I think this whole debate

725.51 --> 730.51
it's just I'm gonna stops sharing is it

728.87 --> 734.87
done today

730.51 --> 738.05
you're still pretend that I'm clicking

734.87 --> 744.14
the green icon okay that's wrong yeah

738.05 --> 746.14
you're back okay yeah I just found it

744.14 --> 748.6999999999999
very interesting that it's putting it

746.14 --> 751.73
into more behave you know like you said

748.7 --> 753.83
an ethereal or supernatural there is a

751.73 --> 756.32
natural I mean what are you thinking to

753.83 --> 757.97
consciousness interactions well how do

756.32 --> 762.44
you think that relate does that relate

757.97 --> 769.3000000000001
to things like the law of thermodynamics

762.44 --> 769.3000000000001
or being or those material laws okay

770.32 --> 778.5500000000001
material laws yeah okay the laws of

776.87 --> 782.39
matter that doesn't have to do with

778.55 --> 785.56
anything living there's loss for the

782.39 --> 788.12
living in there's loss for it matter

785.56 --> 792.3199999999999
and then there's loss for reasoning

788.12 --> 795.95
those are basically as flexible was I've

792.32 --> 797.7800000000001
had a lot of on TV I've had I've had a

795.95 --> 800.8000000000001
lot of people suggest and it seems like

797.78 --> 804.319
they usually tend to be Globus

800.8 --> 806.3
and especially atheist that natural law

804.319 --> 808.67
or if you want to call it God's law or

806.3 --> 812.079
the golden meme or the the Tao or

808.67 --> 813.2299999999999
whatever whatever that that's a social

812.079 --> 821.5089999999999
construct

813.23 --> 825.529
yeah yeah right no well okay taking away

821.509 --> 827.029
a lot of social constructs yeah I would

825.529 --> 828.68
say take if we take the let's put it

827.029 --> 830.509
back in man you know if I'm just minding

828.68 --> 833.209
my own business doing nothing and you

830.509 --> 836.66
feel that you have some urge to come up

833.209 --> 841.189
and I don't know kidnap arrest throw me

836.66 --> 842.99
in a cage hit me your [ __ ] your your

841.189 --> 844.579
initiating violence against me you're

842.99 --> 846.8290000000001
trying to end it

844.579 --> 849.7399999999999
actually the thing he actually goes

846.829 --> 851.87
further and he says every breach of

849.74 --> 853.279
natural law comes down to theft if you

851.87 --> 855.589
murder somebody what are you doing

853.279 --> 858.829
you're you're you're taking that you're

855.589 --> 863.3290000000001
stealing their life yeah my rates up if

858.829 --> 864.949
I rape you I'm stealing your consent so

863.329 --> 867.199
it really I mean that's his and I find

864.949 --> 869.899
that quite interesting that it it can

867.199 --> 872.8389999999999
actually all boil down to theft like

869.899 --> 874.699
that's the I look at the education

872.839 --> 878.0600000000001
system what are they doing to our

874.699 --> 881.81
children with all this this nonsense

878.06 --> 883.9699999999999
well they're giving them dreams for

881.81 --> 885.92
starters Alex what's like what are they

883.97 --> 892.25
if they're thieving what what are they

885.92 --> 894.5
thieving the truth sort of oh that is

892.25 --> 897.259
even dubious because the ones handing it

894.5 --> 900.11
out and somebody started and then the

897.259 --> 904.819
rest just cling on I think they're

900.11 --> 907.66
stealing the their innate right to

904.819 --> 907.66
arrive at their own conclusions

908.8 --> 920.779
no nobody can do that they can

913.459 --> 923.7199999999999
manipulate you but they do if they allow

920.779 --> 925.519
themselves to be manipulated and if how

923.72 --> 928.7900000000001
they are conditioned by their parents

925.519 --> 930.829
basically no I'm just trying to for

928.79 --> 933.199
Anthony's thing I think he's he's on it

930.829 --> 934.0999999999999
but I think it would be better if we can

933.199 --> 937.13
actually

934.1 --> 939.589
lay out that they are engaged in theft

937.13 --> 943.97
which is a crime in natural law and

939.589 --> 949.1300000000001
man's law I don't think so

943.97 --> 952.5400000000001
in necessarily but to basically punish

949.13 --> 955.1
people for asking questions like so

952.54 --> 957.019
Daanish meant like in schools when you

955.1 --> 959.9300000000001
want to know more about Flat Earth I

957.019 --> 961.73
literally got punished when I was at

959.93 --> 965.3
when I said that like oh it's so amazing

961.73 --> 968.63
I even told this story before little kid

965.3 --> 970.819
like oh cool this flower think I want to

968.63 --> 972.62
know more laid it worse it's from I want

970.819 --> 975.17
to know everything about that time and

972.62 --> 977.269
the mindset that brought that forth

975.17 --> 980.0
basically that's how I responded to that

977.269 --> 984.37
and it was like eight and then teaching

980.0 --> 988.069
cut like really like in an anger fit and

984.37 --> 991.9590000000001
got like no that's stupid I got really

988.069 --> 991.959
angry and it was a big person and I was

994.509 --> 999.769
I mean it's just but that's so wrong I

998.149 --> 1004.3
think everybody is but the other guys

999.769 --> 1006.699
that's kind of enough salt well it's a

1004.3 --> 1008.2589999999999
it's a mental assault is almost mental

1006.699 --> 1011.2299999999999
listen an assault that will definitely

1008.259 --> 1018.939
leave marks that will always fit a

1011.23 --> 1021.97
certain description no I mean I was I

1018.939 --> 1028.77
was post-traumatic stress syndrome

1021.97 --> 1035.079
symptoms yes dormant within you but yeah

1028.77 --> 1036.549
such a time then you can completely so I

1035.079 --> 1038.709
would in the US we have this thing

1036.549 --> 1039.6689999999999
called detention where if you're a bad

1038.709 --> 1043.51
boy or girl

1039.669 --> 1046.99
you have to stay F you know essentially

1043.51 --> 1049.59
you have to stay after school it's kind

1046.99 --> 1053.679
of kidding I don't know it's it's

1049.59 --> 1055.72
throwing you in a cage I mean it doesn't

1053.679 --> 1057.159
look like one what it essentially is you

1055.72 --> 1059.1100000000001
can't leave you can't do anything you

1057.159 --> 1062.47
gotta just sit there and write a hundred

1059.11 --> 1064.9189999999999
thousand times why how stupid I know a

1062.47 --> 1067.69
lot about it

1064.919 --> 1070.15
it wasn't exactly but

1067.69 --> 1075.19
the funny thing is I always would try to

1070.15 --> 1077.0500000000002
abuse these times because most of the

1075.19 --> 1080.14
teachers that were sitting after were

1077.05 --> 1082.54
fallen tear did involuntary and they had

1080.14 --> 1084.73
good intentions so they really want and

1082.54 --> 1086.32
I then jumped on because the rest of the

1084.73 --> 1086.89
people were there they just didn't give

1086.32 --> 1089.29
a [ __ ]

1086.89 --> 1091.75
they were just idiots and I would just

1089.29 --> 1093.3999999999999
use the time to just like hear out the

1091.75 --> 1096.27
teacher one-on-one basically because

1093.4 --> 1096.27
nobody else was interested

1098.64 --> 1104.38
oh you got a teacher that was like

1101.32 --> 1105.97
really pissed off at me or something or

1104.38 --> 1119.65
just didn't like me and then I was

1105.97 --> 1121.51
screwed about the behavioral and if I

1119.65 --> 1124.48
think if we start looking at the ball I

1121.51 --> 1129.91
mean the behavior of ballers you know

1124.48 --> 1133.1200000000001
they are being in breach of know it's

1129.91 --> 1135.91
internet these people would never behave

1133.12 --> 1138.4299999999998
like this in person they would have the

1135.91 --> 1140.8000000000002
conditioned responses yes they would

1138.43 --> 1144.16
most likely just run away or stay

1140.8 --> 1145.87
completely silent and freeze up in your

1144.16 --> 1147.19
presence because they're cowards and

1145.87 --> 1151.6299999999999
that's what a lot of people use the

1147.19 --> 1153.7
internet for to basically fend off their

1151.63 --> 1156.88
their hunger for power and their

1153.7 --> 1159.94
aggression into total antisocial

1156.88 --> 1169.68
behavior but in in-person they would

1159.94 --> 1169.68
never dare do that I don't know

1169.92 --> 1178.53
I doubt it they even heard it like a

1174.179 --> 1181.2
long time ago that Riley met up with one

1178.53 --> 1184.2
of these globus like accidentally and

1181.2 --> 1186.1200000000001
they had like drinks and he was really

1184.2 --> 1188.75
nice to him was it sliced bar cane or

1186.12 --> 1191.4289999999999
something I don't know one of these guys

1188.75 --> 1194.64
from the globocide so yeah in person

1191.429 --> 1196.1100000000001
they will behave themselves it's on the

1194.64 --> 1199.7700000000002
internet here where they just go

1196.11 --> 1203.7299999999998
completely insane well I mean Nathan's

1199.77 --> 1205.74
whole channel he doesn't I mean it is

1203.73 --> 1207.78
what it is it's he wants that and that's

1205.74 --> 1209.669
what saying it's right or wrong but it

1207.78 --> 1212.309
is what it is I mean I had a good

1209.669 --> 1214.8300000000002
conversation with quite a few of the

1212.309 --> 1220.53
globe tards I I mean we agreed on a lot

1214.83 --> 1222.75
of stuff but you know I'm not why I

1220.53 --> 1229.22
generally am NOT hearing these things to

1222.75 --> 1231.48
debate people I like to just kind of

1229.22 --> 1234.96
nail down how and why people are

1231.48 --> 1237.96
thinking something and maybe so you know

1234.96 --> 1240.6000000000001
just well connect seemingly unrelated

1237.96 --> 1242.19
things like wait so you know you you

1240.6 --> 1246.9289999999999
think government but but you but you're

1242.19 --> 1252.3600000000001
still a ball you know it's it is amazing

1246.929 --> 1255.23
how I don't see that connection there's

1252.36 --> 1258.75
a distinct psychological disconnect

1255.23 --> 1261.57
concerning NASA for example that is that

1258.75 --> 1264.27
in one hand they know it is officially

1261.57 --> 1266.36
part of government on the other hand

1264.27 --> 1269.94
they believe that it is kind of its own

1266.36 --> 1273.12
idealist thing yeah is actually separate

1269.94 --> 1275.79
so it's like a sub government that is in

1273.12 --> 1278.4599999999998
their minds like know they're always

1275.79 --> 1282.78
tried and how image and for peace and

1278.46 --> 1285.33
that's the Futurists ideal it's an how

1282.78 --> 1287.76
does a interest idealism that is a big

1285.33 --> 1290.4289999999999
part of the concept of NASA you have to

1287.76 --> 1293.22
remember that's part of the dream very

1290.429 --> 1295.26
critical part it's me it's it's quite I

1293.22 --> 1297.3600000000001
can understand why there's a lot of

1295.26 --> 1298.679
people because those people that are

1297.36 --> 1300.33
still like you said clinging to NASA

1298.679 --> 1303.7
even though they know governments PS

1300.33 --> 1305.799
they tend to be like most of us come

1303.7 --> 1309.3700000000001
from a religious family wasn't well long

1305.799 --> 1311.74
ago cute apologetically yes well I mean

1309.37 --> 1315.4289999999999
you see that politics generally still

1311.74 --> 1318.639
devil's with the religious aspect like

1315.429 --> 1320.769
you know God bless america or so but

1318.639 --> 1322.87
then they have a very powerful tool to

1320.769 --> 1325.51
mention this right and then have a

1322.87 --> 1327.25
direct also because it is so

1325.51 --> 1331.48
controversial now in the social justice

1327.25 --> 1333.639
warrior mob is trying to erase it like

1331.48 --> 1336.039
really offensively so if you're gonna

1333.639 --> 1337.899
use it in politics it's a profound

1336.039 --> 1340.48
statement and a lot of people were like

1337.899 --> 1342.9089999999999
oh my god this guy will stop that from

1340.48 --> 1347.08
happening stop it from being erased so

1342.909 --> 1349.6000000000001
it's a very neat easy to use trick

1347.08 --> 1352.75
without of course with consequences

1349.6 --> 1355.149
because then yeah that mob will also

1352.75 --> 1357.639
come after you but it will give you a

1355.149 --> 1360.76
very quick quick audience basically

1357.639 --> 1362.9799999999998
quick following because everyone when

1360.76 --> 1365.169
everything is attacked it's very easy to

1362.98 --> 1368.289
find followers if you promise to defend

1365.169 --> 1370.6000000000001
them from the same could be said for

1368.289 --> 1373.24
acne the academic institutions people

1370.6 --> 1375.07
actually still believe that like MIT or

1373.24 --> 1377.2
Yale and Harvard and Oxford that they're

1375.07 --> 1379.57
just totally disconnected from the state

1377.2 --> 1381.929
which they're not because where it is a

1379.57 --> 1384.309
credit I mean who approves accreditation

1381.929 --> 1385.929
who puts the state's you know it's

1384.309 --> 1388.269
government so I think it's just a lot of

1385.929 --> 1390.909
you know oh Nassau yeah they're not dumb

1388.269 --> 1393.25
religious people just politicians in the

1390.909 --> 1396.909
public is dumb so I'm gonna cling to

1393.25 --> 1398.769
NASA I'm gonna clean the mighty well I

1396.909 --> 1403.99
think that a lot of politicians are

1398.769 --> 1405.639
incredibly freaking them well they're

1403.99 --> 1407.86
just general knowledge at least you know

1405.639 --> 1410.07
they know many of them just know how to

1407.86 --> 1415.0
go along to get along and how to make

1410.07 --> 1417.279
deals and recognize opportunity or

1415.0 --> 1421.529
whatever they're interested in but like

1417.279 --> 1424.269
real smart politicians those are rare

1421.529 --> 1426.519
although they do exist and there seem to

1424.269 --> 1429.1
be coming more there's more people

1426.519 --> 1431.11
trying it out and then it's up to them

1429.1 --> 1433.4189999999999
again like oh yeah so are you gonna

1431.11 --> 1435.9699999999998
eventually corrupt because of the heavy

1433.419 --> 1437.5900000000001
pressures that you will encounter that

1435.97 --> 1440.89
when you don't approach

1437.59 --> 1443.5
you don't even see you know and that's

1440.89 --> 1445.96
up to them so as some new trials I had

1443.5 --> 1447.6
for a lot of people young people getting

1445.96 --> 1449.77
into politics

1447.6 --> 1451.87
hey guys man I'm getting my morning

1449.77 --> 1454.18
going here can someone else I don't got

1451.87 --> 1455.8
a I gotta use the men's room can

1454.18 --> 1457.78
somebody come on in talk with our wind

1455.8 --> 1460.4199999999998

William are you are you guys there

1471.91 --> 1478.9
yah Mia hey yeah yeah you know what

1476.89 --> 1482.14
feel free to jump in at any moment you

1478.9 --> 1484.3300000000002
know yeah you don't have to show them

1482.14 --> 1487.96
join the conversation though all right

1484.33 --> 1492.1499999999999
yeah it was interesting anything to add

1487.96 --> 1495.13
perhaps well not really on that subject

1492.15 --> 1502.23
ever believed in big into the politics

1495.13 --> 1507.4
ugh yeah I do find them fascinating and

1502.23 --> 1509.83
yeah I know I hate it but I have my

1507.4 --> 1512.02
sources so I do kind of keep track like

1509.83 --> 1514.87
what is their stance what are they

1512.02 --> 1517.96
trying to achieve and why do they

1514.87 --> 1520.62
obviously do ridiculous things sometimes

1517.96 --> 1524.74
it's very interesting

1520.62 --> 1527.6499999999999
it's like a big try yeah like an

1524.74 --> 1530.04
experiment it seems like there's a lot

1527.65 --> 1532.9
of social engineering and behavioral

1530.04 --> 1536.92
experimentation going on in government

1532.9 --> 1538.72
circles since the since the media has

1536.92 --> 1541.0600000000002
become so fast and their social media

1538.72 --> 1546.34
it's just fascinating to me to see

1541.06 --> 1550.86
what's going on all right Russ that says

1546.34 --> 1550.86
he has to keep a mutant hey welcome back

1555.84 --> 1566.22
you'll see why is quiet okay oh I see

1562.45 --> 1566.22
he's in the behave what's up Rasta

1567.34 --> 1571.6499999999999
must be here he's out in the West

1568.66 --> 1574.72
collects like yeah kind of fine yet 5:00

1571.65 --> 1581.8000000000002
5:30 in the morning there yeah

1574.72 --> 1585.01
oh that's why it's called Dirty Birds so

1581.8 --> 1587.47
yeah sadly I was listening to um what's

1585.01 --> 1592.15
he's changed it to vegan GUI but his

1587.47 --> 1597.13
channel do you know yep and some some

1592.15 --> 1598.63
girl came on trying to push the convex

1597.13 --> 1601.18
or I can't remember what's the new one

1598.63 --> 1604.0
convex or concave you know it was just

1601.18 --> 1606.76
so telling how she said yeah you know I

1604.0 --> 1608.71
looked into Flat Earth and I just you

1606.76 --> 1613.21
know something didn't make sense you

1608.71 --> 1616.45
know like how can it yeah that's really

1613.21 --> 1619.0
not the core of what flat earth is flat

1616.45 --> 1620.5
earth is just that we don't know I mean

1619.0 --> 1622.15
something like our way you you you're

1620.5 --> 1625.54
instant like finding like measuring

1622.15 --> 1627.43
stuff I'm not really that's cool but

1625.54 --> 1628.93
it's amazing how many people get at flat

1627.43 --> 1630.43
earth and actually think there's a model

1628.93 --> 1634.21
there waiting or something or that

1630.43 --> 1636.67
answers are there like so why are

1634.21 --> 1638.65
various information out there but they

1636.67 --> 1640.99
fail to understand what they're

1638.65 --> 1645.25
basically presented with and these

1640.99 --> 1647.82
models are all projection based right

1645.25 --> 1650.98
maps are projection based and there is

1647.82 --> 1652.6899999999998
no literal projection anywhere to be

1650.98 --> 1655.33
found so there's something weird

1652.69 --> 1658.42
oh yeah anybody this is going that

1655.33 --> 1663.3999999999999
starting the henceforth came my theory

1658.42 --> 1666.73
of spatial non-linearity because if it

1663.4 --> 1669.67
is all flat then there's something weird

1666.73 --> 1674.2
going on in the in the horizontal

1669.67 --> 1679.0
dimension basically because how could

1674.2 --> 1681.6100000000001
there not be a perfect to scale

1679.0 --> 1686.94
projection of it all that is just

1681.61 --> 1686.9399999999998
literals somewhere somewhere anywhere

1687.06 --> 1691.69
yeah I don't think we're gonna know like

1689.74 --> 1698.31
the dimension personally I don't think

1691.69 --> 1698.31
humans can measure and

1698.68 --> 1702.97
think we can I don't think are my that's

1701.44 --> 1705.25
where I'm leaning I just don't think I

1702.97 --> 1710.74
might because it's it's so linear time

1705.25 --> 1713.41
we're so based in linear time all right

1710.74 --> 1716.05
I think that time is nonlinear

1713.41 --> 1721.75
specifically in like other realms or

1716.05 --> 1724.4199999999998
anything I think no I time too in my

1721.75 --> 1726.28
opinion in the physical dimension is

1724.42 --> 1733.1200000000001
absolutely the linear it's one of the

1726.28 --> 1737.62
conditions of this dimension but it's

1733.12 --> 1742.57
more like how space interconnects you

1737.62 --> 1747.2199999999998
see so yeah like the looping concept it

1742.57 --> 1750.3999999999999
could be like a straight block easily

1747.22 --> 1754.75
interface or you can for example imagine

1750.4 --> 1757.27
as excited shape that could also inter

1754.75 --> 1760.39
fit very easily but yeah it could be

1757.27 --> 1764.86
warped like the way things interconnect

1760.39 --> 1766.93
with itself could be nonlinear like even

1764.86 --> 1769.6899999999998
curved like an weird

1766.93 --> 1772.24
curved interconnection so you just cross

1769.69 --> 1774.94
it and you end up in the same place and

1772.24 --> 1778.1200000000001
take that distance but if you then map

1774.94 --> 1781.6000000000001
it out it just does you can't make it

1778.12 --> 1785.26
literally fit in any way because the

1781.6 --> 1788.9199999999998
spatial interconnection is is just

1785.26 --> 1791.46
nonlinear in one or multiple ways and

1788.92 --> 1795.28
that's just extremely confusing and

1791.46 --> 1801.25
frustrating to the intuition it is well

1795.28 --> 1803.92
we want to solve yeah I mean the world I

1801.25 --> 1807.28
observe the life I observe I mean what

1803.92 --> 1810.4
the reality observed to me and I think

1807.28 --> 1813.1299999999999
everybody can see it to one degree or

1810.4 --> 1818.8300000000002
another it's just it's cycles it's it's

1813.13 --> 1820.0300000000002
not a linear life is a cycle I don't see

1818.83 --> 1822.85
it as being so linear

1820.03 --> 1824.92
you know seasons the birth cycle the

1822.85 --> 1826.9599999999998
death site it's just I don't know that's

1824.92 --> 1831.13
what I see that's the second achill

1826.96 --> 1831.789
nature of time whatever you want up you

1831.13 --> 1833.3200000000002
could be

1831.789 --> 1835.269
time as well I'm just talking about the

1833.32 --> 1837.1899999999998
physical world I see life and death is

1835.269 --> 1840.85
just a cycle it's just everywhere I see

1837.19 --> 1844.799
sister cycle so yeah time I click on

1840.85 --> 1848.83
that's how that works

1844.799 --> 1850.479
yeah so the whole con what's the news is

1848.83 --> 1854.639
it convex or what are they selling now

1850.479 --> 1860.049
convex or concave convex yeah sure

1854.639 --> 1864.2489999999998
Texas boy it's like he penned and

1860.049 --> 1868.09
concave is the other way so yeah so all

1864.249 --> 1870.759
kinds of surface elements but yet

1868.09 --> 1875.769
doesn't work it's okay it's all curved

1870.759 --> 1880.499
it's all nonlinear and obstruction rate

1875.769 --> 1883.21
versus distance is linear I clean this I

1880.499 --> 1885.099
can't say that I just reckon straight

1883.21 --> 1887.08
forward statistically prove it but I'm

1885.099 --> 1888.58
absolutely certain and it seems to be

1887.08 --> 1893.2289999999998
the case every time because otherwise

1888.58 --> 1896.379
you would just not see certain things at

1893.229 --> 1899.529
certain incredible distances if there is

1896.379 --> 1901.6589999999999
some kind of curve in any way then

1899.529 --> 1906.399
eventually things in incredible

1901.659 --> 1909.3690000000001
distances will just drop away because of

1906.399 --> 1912.07
the cognitive nature versus the distance

1909.369 --> 1913.9889999999998
so it has to be straight one way or the

1912.07 --> 1917.889
other it's not cave concave if it's not

1913.989 --> 1922.96
curved it's not it's not a hollow sphere

1917.889 --> 1928.119
it's flat but that's just one other

1922.96 --> 1931.8400000000001
aspect yeah yeah indeed a geometric go

1928.119 --> 1933.849
on and it could have also there could be

1931.84 --> 1935.83
I think the other term like the Hollow

1933.849 --> 1938.83
Earth which is something I I looked into

1935.83 --> 1941.109
waiting you know of course it is an

1938.83 --> 1942.879
aspect we often forget like when we talk

1941.109 --> 1946.239
Flat Earth or globe we almost forget

1942.879 --> 1951.2199999999998
what's below our feet you know like yeah

1946.239 --> 1954.6390000000001
I don't know well I am a proponent for

1951.22 --> 1956.769
saying that hey if we are even in the

1954.639 --> 1958.809
rectangular concept which makes

1956.769 --> 1960.789
everything basically like a dimensional

1958.809 --> 1962.649
block although the as I said the

1960.789 --> 1965.41
interconnection could not be perfectly

1962.649 --> 1967.4499999999998
block wise but it makes it very easy to

1965.41 --> 1971.17
sexualize yeah who knows what's down

1967.45 --> 1975.51
there so it could be so vast there could

1971.17 --> 1979.89
be like giant kilometer high caverns

1975.51 --> 1984.84
down there like a shale type concept or

1979.89 --> 1987.73
even just entire realms that are so wide

1984.84 --> 1991.83
underneath there maybe with their own

1987.73 --> 1994.24
kind of weirds other daylight phenomena

1991.83 --> 1998.02
well it seems like the whole possibility

1994.24 --> 1999.91
so many legends about this it's almost

1998.02 --> 2003.06
it's quite if you actually look at this

1999.91 --> 2004.98
this more modern ball obsession it seems

2003.06 --> 2006.57
like it did distract human beings away

2004.98 --> 2008.13
from you know what's in the oceans

2006.57 --> 2010.59
what's down there it's like nobody

2008.13 --> 2013.14
thinks about that stuff anymore so it's

2010.59 --> 2016.5
almost oceans is interesting but yeah

2013.14 --> 2020.16
that's it's like a container because

2016.5 --> 2022.26
otherwise if there was a giant gap then

2020.16 --> 2025.38
yes everything would be filled with

2022.26 --> 2027.96
water down there so who knows maybe

2025.38 --> 2032.64
there are giant water caverns down there

2027.96 --> 2034.89
there are signs through the workings in

2032.64 --> 2037.65
Libya through the waterways there that

2034.89 --> 2042.15
apparently there is a giant super pure

2037.65 --> 2044.6100000000001
water basin deep underneath the desert

2042.15 --> 2048.06
there that they try to basically drill

2044.61 --> 2051.39
into and use it for drinking water so

2048.06 --> 2056.0099999999998
where is that coming from why is it so

2051.39 --> 2057.96
fast and how does that work while

2056.01 --> 2060.3300000000004
beneath the rocks

2057.96 --> 2064.38
is it like underneath the rocks did they

2060.33 --> 2066.5699999999997
dig through like a thin point of pure

2064.38 --> 2069.0
rock where the water would normally rest

2066.57 --> 2071.1000000000004
upon not go through it and they

2069.0 --> 2073.65
discovered this giant water passing down

2071.1 --> 2076.35
there it reminds me a lot of about the

2073.65 --> 2078.81
book dune with the Fremen

2076.35 --> 2081.08
how they had one giant water cavern this

2078.81 --> 2084.33
reminds me so much about that it's just

2081.08 --> 2086.7599999999998
fascinating but yeah we don't know

2084.33 --> 2088.679
everything that is down there already

2086.76 --> 2091.65
discovered and how much could be down

2088.679 --> 2094.89
there it's for me I approached it a bit

2091.65 --> 2098.34
like the dwarf fortress again you might

2094.89 --> 2099.24
have heard of it a geek it's kind of

2098.34 --> 2102.96
like Minecraft

2099.24 --> 2105.7799999999997
but not so visual not 3d

2102.96 --> 2108.69
it is just an ascii based game where you

2105.78 --> 2111.2400000000002
have a community of dwarves that can

2108.69 --> 2113.88
learn skills and basically build an

2111.24 --> 2118.47
industry and then mine the whole place

2113.88 --> 2121.25
like a mountain the mines of Moria or

2118.47 --> 2124.3799999999997
whatever it's very much like that and

2121.25 --> 2126.18
yeah you can take incredibly deep and

2124.38 --> 2129.54
eventually you end up with like lava

2126.18 --> 2131.79
tubes or new caverns with water in it

2129.54 --> 2135.66
and other monsters and eventually you

2131.79 --> 2137.7
end up like in hell yes like a non

2135.66 --> 2140.19
penetrable crust but there's like a

2137.7 --> 2141.8399999999997
demand time in there it's like mithril

2140.19 --> 2143.28
whatever you want to see that actually

2141.84 --> 2144.96
goes through and if you dig through it

2143.28 --> 2148.53
then you end up through the the

2144.96 --> 2152.07
impenetrable crust in hell and then it's

2148.53 --> 2155.4
very fascinating funny and amusing set

2152.07 --> 2159.15
up to screw around with in that game and

2155.4 --> 2161.4300000000003
who knows where this guy got that

2159.15 --> 2165.21
concept from it's awful it's basically a

2161.43 --> 2170.3999999999996
giant generated flat world doesn't it's

2165.21 --> 2173.7
not a globe based so squares with layers

2170.4 --> 2176.28
depth layers it's fascinating and who

2173.7 --> 2180.0
knows what the actual earth is like who

2176.28 --> 2182.94
knows how far you can dig and I can

2180.0 --> 2186.65
imagine that like for example the

2182.94 --> 2189.9
tungsten or the the giant hole the

2186.65 --> 2193.59
deepest on record hole ever dug right

2189.9 --> 2195.15
ran into hydrogen mud that can be

2193.59 --> 2197.88
dangerous and that's an obstacle but

2195.15 --> 2200.4
yeah what happens when you actually

2197.88 --> 2202.71
figure out the technology to surpass

2200.4 --> 2206.609
that without problem you go further

2202.71 --> 2211.859
what's down there who knows so it's all

2206.609 --> 2215.0699999999997
a matter of time yeah indeed it is it is

2211.859 --> 2218.0299999999997
quite to listen to the narrative that

2215.07 --> 2221.4
you know the only thing that the earth

2218.03 --> 2223.92
is valuable for is for fracking and for

2221.4 --> 2225.57
fossil fuels and stuff like nobody's

2223.92 --> 2227.2200000000003
suggesting I mean I don't know can we

2225.57 --> 2229.23
grow stuff down there can we live down

2227.22 --> 2231.1499999999996
there as our methods we used to hear in

2229.23 --> 2233.72
the 70s that the oceans

2231.15 --> 2237.6600000000003
and it just erased the whole ocean

2233.72 --> 2239.6099999999997
exploration from from reality it seems I

2237.66 --> 2242.04
mean I grew up with this watching

2239.61 --> 2244.23
Jacques Cousteau it just was amazed at

2242.04 --> 2246.87
all that I didn't hear about the space

2244.23 --> 2250.29
stuff I was like you know 20,000 Leagues

2246.87 --> 2253.94
Under the Sea and but that if they seem

2250.29 --> 2256.5299999999997
to have erased it like there's just

2253.94 --> 2258.18
resources down there and they're limited

2256.53 --> 2259.98
that's that's what most people look at

2258.18 --> 2265.5299999999997
the earth as like there's nothing of

2259.98 --> 2269.33
value except energy and fish that's it

2265.53 --> 2271.71
no absent there's so much more like a

2269.33 --> 2274.25
circle life's down there and their

2271.71 --> 2279.27
potential medical properties and their

2274.25 --> 2280.86
unique oh my god you don't industry you

2279.27 --> 2283.38
know what you can do with life and

2280.86 --> 2285.78
industry and so many regions incredible

2283.38 --> 2288.48
things bacteria they figured out

2285.78 --> 2292.77
bacteria that can freaking make jewels

2288.48 --> 2295.02
okay what and if you just think about

2292.77 --> 2297.39
that and you're gonna say that all that

2295.02 --> 2299.94
stuff out there is not precious resource

2297.39 --> 2302.66
no it is precious they just didn't

2299.94 --> 2305.61
discover yet in what way it is precious

2302.66 --> 2306.99
and that's the way you really have to

2305.61 --> 2309.6600000000003
approach the earth everything is

2306.99 --> 2312.54
potentially precious you can't read in

2309.66 --> 2316.0499999999997
my personal view it is like the duty to

2312.54 --> 2318.36
make ensure that as much you could say

2316.05 --> 2321.2400000000002
genetic material of everything that's

2318.36 --> 2323.73
around survives in some way doesn't die

2321.24 --> 2326.2799999999997
out could potentially be stored if they

2323.73 --> 2330.69
can make it and then potentially later

2326.28 --> 2332.4
up reproduce like clone it up and try to

2330.69 --> 2334.92
see if you can do it again and they have

2332.4 --> 2339.9900000000002
already been doing that even like Wolf's

2334.92 --> 2342.0
came this in Germany and yeah I love

2339.99 --> 2345.12
that it is always self-evident

2342.0 --> 2347.58
everything we need including other

2345.12 --> 2350.25
mothers-to-be everything we need as life

2347.58 --> 2353.1
is right here on this plane is it's

2350.25 --> 2358.28
there is everything we there's more than

2353.1 --> 2361.71
we need exist so much more and yeah

2358.28 --> 2364.17
there's no need to be go to another

2361.71 --> 2364.71
planet it's just it's ludicrous just

2364.17 --> 2366.4500000000003
everything

2364.71 --> 2369.69
here that we need right now and I

2366.45 --> 2372.6899999999996
foresee couldn't invent a need it's all

2369.69 --> 2375.39
right here it's not and more and more

2372.69 --> 2379.7400000000002
because even and I've ponder upon this a

2375.39 --> 2383.16
lot even if you would consider material

2379.74 --> 2386.45
entropy for example the deterioration

2383.16 --> 2388.859
aspect that matter breaks down that

2386.45 --> 2391.7999999999997
everything you dig up eventually

2388.859 --> 2393.7799999999997
you can probably recycle for a long time

2391.8 --> 2396.03
but every time some of it is destroyed

2393.78 --> 2399.3900000000003
its evaporated it's changed in a way

2396.03 --> 2401.1800000000003
chemically that cannot be reversed but

2399.39 --> 2403.74
for how long

2401.18 --> 2406.2
well hey if already there is a

2403.74 --> 2409.9799999999996
technology and I saw this envision stuff

2406.2 --> 2413.49
based on Tesla high voltage that could

2409.98 --> 2415.77
just like magic potentially just

2413.49 --> 2418.8489999999997
transform matter writings but you just

2415.77 --> 2421.68
have ways you unleash super high voltage

2418.849 --> 2424.4100000000003
business and just blue you look at it

2421.68 --> 2426.39
against like ok it all changed it's just

2424.41 --> 2428.609
something else now it's like oh this

2426.39 --> 2431.4
type of metals we see here hey this oh

2428.609 --> 2436.43
this is like some things we don't know

2431.4 --> 2439.619
what is this element Frankie my god the

2436.43 --> 2442.109
potential for what could be done with

2439.619 --> 2448.4100000000003
the actual things that are possible in

2442.109 --> 2450.42
my mo feel for it is is incredible is

2448.41 --> 2454.3489999999997
the only thing that can basically

2450.42 --> 2458.4
destroy everything is our idiocy

2454.349 --> 2461.01
I hate if we are enlightened then yeah

2458.4 --> 2463.82
we could just build a is a great world

2461.01 --> 2467.94
where everything would thrive and

2463.82 --> 2471.48
nothing would just deteriorate into

2467.94 --> 2473.4
destruction hmm we can do that I believe

2471.48 --> 2474.869
that well I know but - see the problem

2473.4 --> 2479.52
is and I hate to sound like a

2474.869 --> 2480.78
tree-hugging environmentalist but it's

2479.52 --> 2482.97
part of what I call the this

2480.78 --> 2485.0600000000004
disposability consciousness you know

2482.97 --> 2488.8489999999997
like when we consume something like a

2485.06 --> 2490.2599999999998
some fast some crap at the store and you

2488.849 --> 2493.53
say oh I throw it away you know like

2490.26 --> 2495.96
where is a way but that's that's like 30

2493.53 --> 2498.5400000000004
cultural phenomena that didn't that is

2495.96 --> 2501.6
200 years ago to hundra

2498.54 --> 2504.33
years ago everybody used their [ __ ] to

2501.6 --> 2507.15
them who the max if you would have an

2504.33 --> 2509.79
animal slaughtered for food that wasn't

2507.15 --> 2511.4900000000002
just for food everything that could be

2509.79 --> 2513.87
done with that [ __ ] would be done

2511.49 --> 2517.1699999999996
anything they would make tools with the

2513.87 --> 2519.2999999999997
bone or whatever and everything you

2517.17 --> 2523.05
could and they waste was something that

2519.3 --> 2525.8100000000004
was ridiculous thing is throwing

2523.05 --> 2527.9700000000003
something away like that just like or

2525.81 --> 2532.17
they were just naturally like replanted

2527.97 --> 2536.0699999999997
in the ground right that's my vagin ways

2532.17 --> 2537.57
made to be and that's why this all earth

2536.07 --> 2541.25
comes in that's why the you know oh

2537.57 --> 2543.27
we're just gonna throw away this earth

2541.25 --> 2546.21
it's retardation

2543.27 --> 2549.39
it's an insanity the whole idea that you

2546.21 --> 2552.21
can just get away you get but it's not

2549.39 --> 2555.33
crazy if you think about the culture

2552.21 --> 2558.81
that it is riding on because they

2555.33 --> 2560.79
display their prime people which are

2558.81 --> 2565.65
dumb asses and they basically show them

2560.79 --> 2566.49
yeah we and you are dumb asses humanity

2565.65 --> 2568.86
is stupid

2566.49 --> 2572.16
and you are too stupid to even realize

2568.86 --> 2574.32
that there are ways out and there are

2572.16 --> 2576.66
people that are brilliant that can fix

2574.32 --> 2579.3900000000003
it because you hate them because they

2576.66 --> 2583.3799999999997
often disagree with you on your own

2579.39 --> 2584.91
earth tender feelings or whatever so

2583.38 --> 2586.6800000000003
we're going to ignore it and just say

2584.91 --> 2589.14
yeah because of that because everyone is

2586.68 --> 2591.21
like as stupid as you everything will go

2589.14 --> 2592.77
to [ __ ] so we must go to new planets

2591.21 --> 2599.06
because it's all gonna turn into a waste

2592.77 --> 2603.09
heat it's it's super sick and

2599.06 --> 2605.16
unnecessary like it's fun to have a if

2603.09 --> 2608.84
there would be other plants love to do

2605.16 --> 2611.8799999999997
stuff with it but we don't need to

2608.84 --> 2616.8
believe that this earth is going to be a

2611.88 --> 2622.05
giant trashy ya know it's it makes no

2616.8 --> 2626.46
sense it is inevitable it look at what's

2622.05 --> 2629.4300000000003
already out there the recycling

2626.46 --> 2631.08
smart fabrication compartmentalised

2629.43 --> 2632.73
fabricate there's so many things out

2631.08 --> 2636.18
there that you can do that

2632.73 --> 2638.07
already being done and the only thing

2636.18 --> 2641.94
really stopping like a hundred percent

2638.07 --> 2645.78
recycling is fine financial ISM its

2641.94 --> 2648.54
finance it's like okay do we really want

2645.78 --> 2650.34
to draw this crowd that's Pro recycling

2648.54 --> 2652.02
and something a little more because they

2650.34 --> 2656.1600000000003
will pay because they want it so much or

2652.02 --> 2659.1
are we gonna go for big mass production

2656.16 --> 2661.23
profits and get more out of it then and

2659.1 --> 2664.11
that's just a big problem because a lot

2661.23 --> 2666.21
of people that have money need to be

2664.11 --> 2668.4300000000003
there to steer these things but most of

2666.21 --> 2671.58
these people just care about money and

2668.43 --> 2672.99
that's the very well-reasoned I don't

2671.58 --> 2674.64
want to say they are so dependent on

2672.99 --> 2676.7999999999997
their money that is all they end up

2674.64 --> 2678.93
hearing about I don't want to say that

2676.8 --> 2681.0
we shouldn't recycle but we gotta

2678.93 --> 2682.5899999999997
remember that it's just a word and I

2681.0 --> 2685.02
hate to tell you but the earth is gonna

2682.59 --> 2690.48
recycle everything one way or the other

2685.02 --> 2694.47
I mean right now but wouldn't need to if

2690.48 --> 2698.04
we help it along right clean up the

2694.47 --> 2700.97
rivers clean up the oceans plastic it's

2698.04 --> 2704.04
already happening but even like help

2700.97 --> 2708.3599999999997
what I would call it is cultivate all

2704.04 --> 2710.46
life not naturally for for production

2708.36 --> 2713.82
for food but just freakin cultivate

2710.46 --> 2715.4700000000003
every place study it study the nature

2713.82 --> 2717.9900000000002
study the bacteria in the ground study

2715.47 --> 2720.39
what's going on see why it works the way

2717.99 --> 2721.9199999999996
it does it could take lifetimes to do

2720.39 --> 2724.02
this it's already being done for

2721.92 --> 2729.66
hundreds of years probably in some areas

2724.02 --> 2733.77
and then just ensure you can reproduce

2729.66 --> 2737.58
it perhaps and yeah then you can get

2733.77 --> 2740.79
into interesting opportunities because

2737.58 --> 2744.0
this is bad for the economy though no no

2740.79 --> 2747.48
it doesn't need to be that's the thing

2744.0 --> 2750.45
if your progress ecology well enough

2747.48 --> 2753.57
then certain things will suddenly no

2750.45 --> 2761.3999999999996
longer become obstacles say for example

2753.57 --> 2764.19
there is a giant whatever a precious

2761.4 --> 2766.35
resource of some kind that's very unique

2764.19 --> 2771.09
very concentrated very hard to

2766.35 --> 2772.86
find and it's kind of polluting to to

2771.09 --> 2775.77
get it out of the ground and it's right

2772.86 --> 2778.23
underneath the most ancient forests in

2775.77 --> 2780.48
the world and if you're gonna dig it up

2778.23 --> 2782.16
it's all gonna die it's absolutely all

2780.48 --> 2784.44
gonna die because the bacteria there

2782.16 --> 2787.8599999999997
will all die because of the yeah what

2784.44 --> 2789.9
are you gonna do you know industrialists

2787.86 --> 2792.51
will push to get it done because they'd

2789.9 --> 2795.9
rather than see it dead and get their

2792.51 --> 2798.3
stuff then just have to stare at it all

2795.9 --> 2800.79
the time so what do you do well if you

2798.3 --> 2806.88
advanced ecology enough then you could

2800.79 --> 2809.55
potentially try to displace the forest

2806.88 --> 2814.1600000000003
you could try to make it migrate you

2809.55 --> 2817.29
could potentially even scoop out giant

2814.16 --> 2819.7999999999997
compartments of forests with giant

2817.29 --> 2822.69
flying vehicles and just transport

2819.8 --> 2826.32
sections of forests with the important

2822.69 --> 2829.29
ground parts all in one just displace it

2826.32 --> 2832.1400000000003
and then the mind can happen and you

2829.29 --> 2833.88
could have that most critical important

2832.14 --> 2835.77
force somewhere else it will take some

2833.88 --> 2838.44
adjusting but the ground and all the

2835.77 --> 2841.14
bacteria in it will remain pretty much

2838.44 --> 2846.54
the same if you leave it in huge chunks

2841.14 --> 2849.3599999999997
like say a hundred foot or a hundred

2846.54 --> 2852.24
meter square blocks of forest ground

2849.36 --> 2855.6
with trees on them and everything you

2852.24 --> 2857.6099999999997
could save a lot and yeah that will

2855.6 --> 2859.35
allow industrialists to finally get

2857.61 --> 2861.2400000000002
their things so they're no longer gonna

2859.35 --> 2864.24
stare at that force and try to somehow

2861.24 --> 2866.0699999999997
destroy it or poison it like oh yeah see

2864.24 --> 2869.3399999999997
it's destroyed so now we can finally do

2866.07 --> 2871.86
it this is what industry is let's do and

2869.34 --> 2874.86
that's one of the biggest problems

2871.86 --> 2878.0
humanity has ever had yes there are

2874.86 --> 2881.19
greedy people that will destroy anything

2878.0 --> 2883.62
to get to it no matter how much time it

2881.19 --> 2887.1
takes it's not just it just can work

2883.62 --> 2890.0699999999997
around this we can ever stop this from

2887.1 --> 2891.8399999999997
being damaging X you know remind people

2890.07 --> 2893.61
and I don't know if you've thought about

2891.84 --> 2896.55
it this way but I have to remind people

2893.61 --> 2898.6800000000003
what so so long ago where people in

2896.55 --> 2898.9500000000003
general like if you said oh I need to

2898.68 --> 2900.6299999999997
get

2898.95 --> 2904.109
job or I need a current like these are

2900.63 --> 2907.32
relic this whole job and career these

2904.109 --> 2909.24
are new inventions like you go back a

2907.32 --> 2911.69
few generations and people were just you

2909.24 --> 2915.0
know they were a farmer they were a

2911.69 --> 2916.8
tailor like they didn't have a date you

2915.0 --> 2919.02
know what I'm saying this role they were

2916.8 --> 2921.75
shocked to get a job have a career that

2919.02 --> 2923.91
need to be connected because they

2921.75 --> 2926.31
weren't just self providing and they

2923.91 --> 2929.1299999999997
were busy enough with that already and

2926.31 --> 2931.7599999999998
they didn't have the culture to be so

2929.13 --> 2936.78
interconnected to be always socializing

2931.76 --> 2939.3900000000003
most farmers out there they just all

2936.78 --> 2942.329
they don't give a [ __ ] just do what they

2939.39 --> 2944.0989999999997
do this obsession with jobs and careers

2942.329 --> 2945.8390000000004
it's a relatively can't stand people

2944.099 --> 2949.38
that are constantly in their phones and

2945.839 --> 2951.15
anything else no that's it that's a huge

2949.38 --> 2954.06
aspect and I don't know how we're gonna

2951.15 --> 2956.31
have technology in maintaining this idea

2954.06 --> 2958.41
of people need a job and a career path

2956.31 --> 2962.67
it's it's just how can you have both

2958.41 --> 2965.8489999999997
well you could but it's just in my

2962.67 --> 2968.7200000000003
personal opinion providing the technical

2965.849 --> 2972.9300000000003
revolution and the elites all allow it

2968.72 --> 2975.8999999999996
not be necessarily financially based it

2972.93 --> 2980.45
should be what can you do what can you

2975.9 --> 2984.21
contribute it's kind of like communism

2980.45 --> 2986.1299999999997
isn't without government the question is

2984.21 --> 2988.619
I'm not saying that people should just

2986.13 --> 2991.4100000000003
sit on a big innit communism without

2988.619 --> 2994.02
government I just let the technology

2991.41 --> 2997.29
provide and everybody just tries to do

2994.02 --> 3002.93
what what they're good at and what other

2997.29 --> 3005.0
people like and know is that would work

3002.93 --> 3009.0789999999997
and makes a lot of people has it be a

3005.0 --> 3011.06
productive most saying people want to do

3009.079 --> 3019.0600000000004
something most sane people don't want to

3011.06 --> 3019.06
sit on the sofa watching daytime TV but

3019.42 --> 3026.51
being productive and having a job or a

3023.81 --> 3028.67
career is not the same thing for it just

3026.51 --> 3031.5200000000004
people I don't know how to explain it

3028.67 --> 3032.57
it's not it's not natural to sit on the

3031.52 --> 3034.4
sofa and be a war

3032.57 --> 3038.3
of the state and taking welfare and

3034.4 --> 3041.48
getting fat it's not there no way it is

3038.3 --> 3041.7200000000003
totally destructive look I I will say it

3041.48 --> 3046.31
again

3041.72 --> 3050.45
I take welfare but it oh my god it

3046.31 --> 3052.61
pushes on me and it's good that I have a

3050.45 --> 3055.52
plan for my future that I know where I'm

3052.61 --> 3057.4700000000003
going but yeah I come also from a family

3055.52 --> 3059.36
that was very pushy about it like you

3057.47 --> 3062.0299999999997
have to have a job we have to have a and

3059.36 --> 3064.4900000000002
I was always terrible at it because just

3062.03 --> 3067.3100000000004
the jobs that I did try they would drive

3064.49 --> 3069.74
me do that job we're driving mad it

3067.31 --> 3072.62
would be so unfulfilled would be so a

3069.74 --> 3079.7299999999996
waste of time even while I was busy

3072.62 --> 3082.46
I was bored I was just yeah well what is

3079.73 --> 3084.7400000000002
it I'm pretty sure that 90% of jobs out

3082.46 --> 3086.93
there are just jobs for the sake of jobs

3084.74 --> 3088.43
I know people with government contracts

3086.93 --> 3090.14
that are literally there buying

3088.43 --> 3092.87
computers they don't even plug them in

3090.14 --> 3095.39
and hire people to just get the heads to

3092.87 --> 3097.31
say yep we've got you know five black

3095.39 --> 3099.3799999999997
women we got a couple gays and they just

3097.31 --> 3103.2799999999997
sit there they're hiring people

3099.38 --> 3104.9
yeah PR to sit there and literally do

3103.28 --> 3106.67
nothing they told is like we don't even

3104.9 --> 3108.83
plug the computers in they're not

3106.67 --> 3110.21
networked they're just there so we can

3108.83 --> 3112.22
show that we bought X amount of

3110.21 --> 3113.75
computers and we're hiring X amount of

3112.22 --> 3119.24
people and they just sit there and

3113.75 --> 3122.39
people are on their phone in a is this

3119.24 --> 3127.4599999999996
it makes me nauseating even thinking

3122.39 --> 3131.0299999999997
about it like hey I would really love to

3127.46 --> 3132.92
be in such a position but I would

3131.03 --> 3134.36
actually use that time and the

3132.92 --> 3137.42
connections and the people I deal with

3134.36 --> 3139.6400000000003
to get my things done in the way I see

3137.42 --> 3141.83
fit and if there was some protocol that

3139.64 --> 3144.5
prevents me from basically being a

3141.83 --> 3146.96
socially engaging person then I would

3144.5 --> 3149.45
run away screaming no matter how much

3146.96 --> 3151.73
money I gave because I would be in a

3149.45 --> 3154.73
mind prison yeah I get money but I

3151.73 --> 3159.83
basically can't interact anymore I can't

3154.73 --> 3161.27
grow I can't I don't have the answers

3159.83 --> 3163.79
how we're gonna get over this this

3161.27 --> 3166.25
technological unemployment job creation

3163.79 --> 3168.95
I'm not against money and it is

3166.25 --> 3171.29
we can get over it the problem is there

3168.95 --> 3174.0499999999997
has to be a cultural but also media

3171.29 --> 3178.16
revolution about the conception of

3174.05 --> 3181.07
economy because how the people know

3178.16 --> 3182.8399999999997
economy is oversimplified very much so

3181.07 --> 3185.3300000000004
and there's a lot of people openly

3182.84 --> 3186.8900000000003
studying it and giving their opinions

3185.33 --> 3189.71
very interesting I've been following a

3186.89 --> 3193.33
lot of them for like 20 years but the

3189.71 --> 3196.099
thing is is that when stress gets high

3193.33 --> 3198.65
people will offer simplify and then

3196.099 --> 3201.65
economy just becomes like oh now we do

3198.65 --> 3204.98
this now we do that and that's a big

3201.65 --> 3210.23
problem because it's you should just be

3204.98 --> 3211.91
looking at the long-term results I guess

3210.23 --> 3214.099
but there's a problem because yeah who's

3211.91 --> 3216.0699999999997
gonna predict what's gonna happen but we

3214.099 --> 3220.15
we have spins through so many things

3216.07 --> 3222.8590000000004
there should just be a very stable guide

3220.15 --> 3226.4900000000002
for the economy and then the media

3222.859 --> 3228.38
should just stop screwing around with it

3226.49 --> 3231.08
and politicizing the economy basically

3228.38 --> 3232.76
no they're gonna push that looks like

3231.08 --> 3236.69
they're gonna push the masses into this

3232.76 --> 3238.599
what's the living wage oh great that's

3236.69 --> 3241.31
going to be a wonderful wonderful

3238.599 --> 3246.349
outcome like who's gonna decide what the

3241.31 --> 3248.15
cost of all we know that yeah I mean it

3246.349 --> 3252.619
sounds nice yeah I don't want people to

3248.15 --> 3255.65
be homeless or hungry but living wage I

3252.619 --> 3258.619
just I what do you mean you mean like a

3255.65 --> 3261.9500000000003
basic income yeah that's the base yeah I

3258.619 --> 3266.869
mean government or so in government

3261.95 --> 3271.91
bastes yeah it is potentially good but

3266.869 --> 3275.839
the potential for corruption is vast and

3271.91 --> 3279.68
terrible and also the the problem is is

3275.839 --> 3281.27
that once people do get like finally get

3279.68 --> 3283.94
fulfilled they're no longer under stress

3281.27 --> 3285.71
they become very dreamy they don't pay

3283.94 --> 3289.13
attention anymore and that is so

3285.71 --> 3293.33
abusable by government to then just go

3289.13 --> 3296.33
completely bureaucratic or autocratic or

3293.33 --> 3298.2799999999997
just turn things over that people would

3296.33 --> 3299.84
normally not allow and that is a huge

3298.28 --> 3304.2200000000003
danger so in

3299.84 --> 3308.2400000000002
my opinion basic income is a pragmatic

3304.22 --> 3311.81
good concept but a dangerous tool to be

3308.24 --> 3314.75
allowed in the hands of government it

3311.81 --> 3317.06
should just be like a human right rather

3314.75 --> 3319.4
if you approach a human right why's that

3317.06 --> 3320.24
everyone just has it nobody is allowed

3319.4 --> 3324.2000000000003
to take it away

3320.24 --> 3327.5
or force you to conform in some way then

3324.2 --> 3330.08
well it would be a lot safer I'd rather

3327.5 --> 3332.03
see it this isn't genius look it doesn't

3330.08 --> 3335.24
matter if you're in communist China or

3332.03 --> 3340.61
the Europe or the US what's the number

3335.24 --> 3342.7
one debt live in your home well that's

3340.61 --> 3348.35
for most people because that's how they

3342.7 --> 3351.1899999999996
do that yeah there's so 20 years to even

3348.35 --> 3353.75
get a home yeah it's really us mortgages

3351.19 --> 3356.81
exactly I think if you really want to

3353.75 --> 3360.44
get it back to a more sane money just

3356.81 --> 3363.68
just look at housing housing is right

3360.44 --> 3365.87
there that's a foundation or that the

3363.68 --> 3368.54
car like what do these costs come from

3365.87 --> 3370.7
it's it's it wasn't long ago no pens

3368.54 --> 3374.33
it's an open market and it's very

3370.7 --> 3376.58
liberal and it's financially like it can

3374.33 --> 3378.44
go all over the place and the elites

3376.58 --> 3381.29
allow it you could make it more strict

3378.44 --> 3383.2400000000002
more stable yeah take take away the idea

3381.29 --> 3384.65
of financing imagine if there was no

3383.24 --> 3386.54
such thing as mortgages what do you

3384.65 --> 3388.82
think prices would go to you can't

3386.54 --> 3393.8
finance a house it has to be paid in

3388.82 --> 3396.29
cash right anyway guys yeah Erica who's
