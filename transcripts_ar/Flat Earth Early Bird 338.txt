152.73 --> 160.89
very good movie surprisingly so yeah I

157.17 --> 165.73999999999998
might take a look at that the original

160.89 --> 169.14
that is so thank you for that

165.74 --> 174.96

force michael roark ego playing an

179.34 --> 186.08
anchor son monkey 3d yeah good to see

183.6 --> 186.07999999999998
you all

190.64 --> 197.80999999999997
let's see yeah I've been watching a lot

195.96 --> 201.63
of Star Trek yesterday

197.81 --> 210.29
and I have to say like wow the second

201.63 --> 215.04
season is just so much more refined and

210.29 --> 218.54999999999998
it already has less of the liberal D

215.04 --> 221.97
like a forced liberal type feeling that

218.55 --> 223.86
much of the first season had its very

221.97 --> 227.42
originated away the second one is a lot

223.86 --> 233.73000000000002
better and pretty quickly

227.42 --> 238.91
huge huge flat earth related seems like

233.73 --> 238.91
wow totally blew me away

239.0 --> 246.75
especially because not only was a basic

242.76 --> 250.67999999999998
flat earth dropped it's being stupid of

246.75 --> 253.38
course but still from a certain angle at

250.68 --> 257.34000000000003
least they were getting into philosophy

253.38 --> 261.87
as it were and then as part of what was

257.34 --> 264.479
going on also revealed not in a direct

261.87 --> 269.11
sense but it was directly tying in to

264.479 --> 272.8
that scene there was a loop in the room

269.11 --> 275.8
yeah a treatment station loop the

272.8 --> 279.789
looping nature it was there and so I

275.8 --> 284.319
just immediately like what you serious

279.789 --> 287.74
Star Trek's next generation so that

284.319 --> 292.349
leave reveals a looping nature it's as a

287.74 --> 292.349
hint it was pretty incredible

293.789 --> 300.99
Captain Picard carries around a crystal

296.8 --> 300.99
okay interesting

301.05 --> 314.159
so do I to actually anyway yeah and just

311.259 --> 318.129
the rest well after that and there was a

314.159 --> 327.029
season 2 episode 2 where that happened

318.129 --> 331.21000000000004
at the what is it twelve minute mark and

327.029 --> 335.86
let me see I referenced it in Skype yeah

331.21 --> 339.63899999999995
season 2 episode 2 at 12 minutes and 33

335.86 --> 343.36
seconds the flat earth comes in and then

339.639 --> 348.279
at this 27 minute mark yeah a looping

343.36 --> 353.949
space is certainly revealed in that same

348.279 --> 356.71
episode so yeah check it out is bit it's

353.949 --> 362.199
an interesting episode and just yeah I

356.71 --> 364.18
love bumping into that yeah but after

362.199 --> 367.389
that there were just a lot of much

364.18 --> 370.36
better written episodes with great

367.389 --> 374.08
strong character developments and they

370.36 --> 376.24
made it believable that's that's really

374.08 --> 379.75
the biggest achievement is that they put

376.24 --> 383.56
those character developing developing in

379.75 --> 386.94
there and made it believable because

383.56 --> 390.819
that is the hardest part about it and

386.94 --> 397.11
yeah good stuff so

390.819 --> 400.369
and enjoying that watching a lot of it

397.11 --> 400.369
[Music]

401.139 --> 415.81
let's see what did I miss oh yeah if I

412.879 --> 420.22900000000004
haven't mentioned yet weirdly enough

415.81 --> 422.3
grantees quit officially he's not

420.229 --> 424.37
deleting he's just taking a work break

422.3 --> 430.61
and I think it's pretty much probably a

424.37 --> 433.36
sensible decision in a way do find it

430.61 --> 433.36
kind of ironic

437.919 --> 449.639
because I'm still here anyway let's see

446.289 --> 449.639
what you guys are talking about

456.37 --> 466.96
[Music]

461.699 --> 470.379
you did pumpkin how so did he already

466.96 --> 472.539
give away that he was faltering in

470.379 --> 476.22900000000004
motivation look I especially the first

472.539 --> 481.24
few roundtable things I didn't pay

476.229 --> 483.18899999999996
attention right it didn't quit he just

481.24 --> 490.139
working well yeah what is going to

483.189 --> 498.46000000000004
effectively not be active anymore so

490.139 --> 502.449
anyway that's happening yeah and look

498.46 --> 505.35999999999996
even despite that the grantee has just

502.449 --> 511.12
so much material that that he's already

505.36 --> 514.24
put out we can just keep on using all of

511.12 --> 521.229
that and digging through it for a long

514.24 --> 522.94
period to come so you know think of

521.229 --> 525.49
Randi whatever you want but Heaton has

522.94 --> 532.3190000000001
provided some stellar photography and

525.49 --> 532.319
footage with good data along with it

540.78 --> 543.919
[Music]

551.56 --> 555.7399999999999
[Music]

569.74 --> 588.2
right right yeah I guess the things that

585.95 --> 590.72
I've been pondering on the most once

588.2 --> 595.19
again it's not the first time funnily

590.72 --> 597.5600000000001
enough I think the once again just that

595.19 --> 605.0200000000001
moment in the Bible reflecting upon the

597.56 --> 611.3299999999999
sons of God and how little is included

605.02 --> 615.05
within that clearly bigger part yeah a

611.33 --> 617.14
story that's not being told basically so

615.05 --> 620.5
did the nature but it did definitely

617.14 --> 623.48
inspire me a lot to compare everything

620.5 --> 630.1
to the effect and then just try to

623.48 --> 635.1800000000001
figure out what it is what they are and

630.1 --> 639.62
why they've come to be because to me to

635.18 --> 642.56
see the proof of the design of the realm

639.62 --> 644.69
and all living things within it that is

642.56 --> 647.9
one thing and that is basically did the

644.69 --> 649.94
Spirit of the creator that is the that

647.9 --> 655.4599999999999
is creation it's the Alpha and Omega it

649.94 --> 661.5200000000001
is the the design was spawned forth from

655.46 --> 664.5500000000001
a a perfect perspective where all of it

661.52 --> 668.3
could be seen and understood and that is

664.55 --> 671.0
what makes it so omnipotent but that is

668.3 --> 673.91
the designer that is the this the thing

671.0 --> 679.07
that made things manifest the way they

673.91 --> 681.98
hid and yeah whoever the Elohim are that

679.07 --> 684.1400000000001
actually dwelled over the face of the

681.98 --> 688.85
waters and then started to shape the

684.14 --> 691.39
earth in a realm into what it is - yeah

688.85 --> 694.4300000000001
to tinker with the elements and

691.39 --> 697.96
literally manifest the realm out of the

694.43 --> 697.9599999999999
energies you could say

698.11 --> 709.4300000000001
they themselves and from what the book

703.79 --> 712.49
is showing seem to have a consciousness

709.43 --> 718.9399999999999
a separated consciousness and which

712.49 --> 721.07
would just inevitably also bind like ego

718.94 --> 723.2600000000001
elements to it in some way if there's a

721.07 --> 726.1400000000001
learning process that means there's an

723.26 --> 729.95
ego and there seems to be a learning

726.14 --> 732.529
process of the especially from what I've

729.95 --> 738.5600000000001
seen in the in the first book in the

732.529 --> 740.48
Torah part it seems to be learning and

738.56 --> 743.18
even saying like I think this was a

740.48 --> 749.4200000000001
mistake and such and that just shows it

743.18 --> 753.77
is not a literal it is not literally the

749.42 --> 757.9399999999999
omnipresence it is not the design

753.77 --> 762.0699999999999
throughout it is a linear progression

757.94 --> 765.5600000000001
based issue do you understand

762.07 --> 770.87
learning is linear progression based

765.56 --> 773.3
it's time bound if you are unbound by

770.87 --> 775.43
time and they have oversight over all

773.3 --> 778.37
things you don't have that problem so it

775.43 --> 782.12
is a sign of personification and that

778.37 --> 785.69
means that these entities the Elohim may

782.12 --> 788.29
be separate identities by themselves as

785.69 --> 792.6800000000001
I said they may be the very arms of

788.29 --> 795.079
creation itself to manifest it but they

792.68 --> 799.43
may be separate and disarmed of their of

795.079 --> 802.76
themselves and that may be the Elohim

799.43 --> 803.27
and that may alo him that let's just say

802.76 --> 808.149
it like this

803.27 --> 808.149
okay the arm of creation the Elohim that

808.39 --> 814.06
manifested the earth

810.43 --> 816.62
they may have eventually those those

814.06 --> 820.88
personified beings as they seem to be

816.62 --> 822.579
may have eventually turned into the yet

820.88 --> 826.4
the Dark One's

822.579 --> 828.9699999999999
in a way because of all the hassle and

826.4 --> 830.6
the changing around while the original

828.97 --> 833.1800000000001
spirit of

830.6 --> 836.3000000000001
creation separated itself from the

833.18 --> 842.06
original tools of creation see where I'm

836.3 --> 844.699
going at it look I'm just trying to be

842.06 --> 849.1389999999999
super logical and consequent with this

844.699 --> 850.88
and also be honest about that there is

849.139 --> 853.819
very likely to be a lot of missing

850.88 --> 859.3389999999999
information so I'm trying to figure out

853.819 --> 863.209
a sensible enough structure a model a

859.339 --> 867.889
model for creation that you just love

863.209 --> 869.8699999999999
that ballers yeah a model trying to

867.889 --> 873.889
figure out how is this manifesting and

869.87 --> 875.99
I'm kind of basing it on references even

873.889 --> 879.949
to natural law and not specifically like

875.99 --> 882.589
gas law but for example electric law the

879.949 --> 887.079
polarization the typical polarization

882.589 --> 889.85
the duality bound to matter and all that

887.079 --> 893.149
thinking of it if it is something within

889.85 --> 897.259
the material landscape that created it

893.149 --> 902.87
all that became the arm of creation then

897.259 --> 905.8100000000001
it itself if seemingly having personal

902.87 --> 908.36
conscious time bound somehow maybe still

905.81 --> 912.38
the oversight of the Creator but still

908.36 --> 915.139
also ego time bound and thus prone to

912.38 --> 919.12
mistakes and thus becoming separate from

915.139 --> 922.069
the absolute spirit of creation that

919.12 --> 924.199
yeah it may turn out that they

922.069 --> 926.36
eventually kind of stepped away from the

924.199 --> 928.9699999999999
Spirit of creation after they were done

926.36 --> 932.089
maybe they felt too superfluous maybe

928.97 --> 936.4390000000001
the creation was too perfect and they

932.089 --> 938.5400000000001
weren't needed anymore and then because

936.439 --> 942.38
of the nature of what they were they

938.54 --> 945.139
weren't mortal they instead just

942.38 --> 950.54
corrupted inevitably and maybe that was

945.139 --> 953.509
the original designers mistake but it

950.54 --> 956.389
was a mistake that well had to be made

953.509 --> 961.85
to eventually create the opponents that

956.389 --> 963.79
would keep the progress of life of the

961.85 --> 969.889
creation

963.79 --> 971.18
challenged I don't know why you're

969.889 --> 973.339
bringing up the towel mood AGM

971.18 --> 978.1389999999999
absolutely don't know I'm purely

973.339 --> 982.3100000000001
referencing everything I've this this

978.139 --> 988.5790000000001
realm how it supposedly came into being

982.31 --> 993.0189999999999
how who were the directors you could say

988.579 --> 996.319
the alien they obviously are directly

993.019 --> 1001.089
pointed at as the ones shaping the realm

996.319 --> 1005.61
as we know it and designing or putting

1001.089 --> 1010.87
together life you know it doesn't say

1005.61 --> 1012.069
design it says it they manifest do you

1010.87 --> 1014.5600000000001
understand the difference

1012.069 --> 1016.66
it doesn't say look they designed it

1014.56 --> 1020.0189999999999
from scratch so this and that now they

1016.66 --> 1024.819
just manifested these things and the

1020.019 --> 1026.559
design just naturally came into place so

1024.819 --> 1028.78
I don't think that these arms of

1026.559 --> 1030.97
creation denilla him themselves were

1028.78 --> 1035.339
actually designing it they were just the

1030.97 --> 1038.559
end your energy conduit the interface

1035.339 --> 1043.3899999999999
for the spirit of creation for the

1038.559 --> 1046.8999999999999
designer to manifest the design that was

1043.39 --> 1050.94
there as the essence of creation itself

1046.9 --> 1050.94
as you see yeah

1056.04 --> 1063.48
yeah AGM you're putting it there in caps

1065.04 --> 1068.79
let's bring it up

1077.24 --> 1080.24
magistrates

1082.61 --> 1085.899
okay interesting

1087.72 --> 1097.049
okay well look well however you're gonna

1092.789 --> 1102.269
see that it all points away from a

1097.049 --> 1111.779
singer singular United ego bound being

1102.269 --> 1114.09
as it were so in that sense when now

1111.779 --> 1117.299
comparing it to another the other part

1114.09 --> 1120.99
of the book into the New Testament when

1117.299 --> 1125.85
Jesus and all surrounding yeah emphasize

1120.99 --> 1128.279
the one true God and all that that kind

1125.85 --> 1132.779
of suggests like there literally is only

1128.279 --> 1139.909
one God but it seems that that is

1132.779 --> 1144.269
probably not correct doesn't mean that

1139.909 --> 1147.8400000000001
that God is not the designer himself

1144.269 --> 1150.21
because it could be but it just it

1147.84 --> 1153.09
suggests something while at the same

1150.21 --> 1157.74
time yeah there are apparently sons of

1153.09 --> 1162.139
God and all of that so I think that

1157.74 --> 1164.82
there was probably been a pantheon

1162.139 --> 1167.49
especially if the Elohim weren't even

1164.82 --> 1169.74
the the very manifestations themselves

1167.49 --> 1172.49
if they were supposed magistrates it

1169.74 --> 1175.47
just seems like there is an alternative

1172.49 --> 1183.259
realm the heavens realm where does just

1175.47 --> 1183.259
this it's full of things of

1184.42 --> 1190.24
of gods and servants and the angels I

1187.84 --> 1191.83
guess and you have later there's much

1190.24 --> 1195.309
more brought into the story concerning

1191.83 --> 1198.1599999999999
it just it just points at it that it's

1195.309 --> 1203.59
not the only one or at least he wasn't

1198.16 --> 1206.47
the only one and maybe I don't get

1203.59 --> 1209.1399999999999
clarity from the book so far at least it

1206.47 --> 1216.39
might be there eventually might figure

1209.14 --> 1221.8300000000002
it out that it doesn't say how the gods

1216.39 --> 1225.16
came to be it does it doesn't even tell

1221.83 --> 1228.73
you as to it tells you how the earth

1225.16 --> 1234.059
round came into being it doesn't say how

1228.73 --> 1234.059
God came into being they were just there

1238.94 --> 1247.929
so that leaves open a lot anyway I've

1244.609 --> 1249.879
been pondering on this a lot and also

1247.929 --> 1252.44
cross-referencing it with the

1249.879 --> 1257.629
preponderance of dark world experiences

1252.44 --> 1262.239
that I had and early attempts from the

1257.629 --> 1264.7289999999998
other side to awaken me in a time where

1262.239 --> 1267.349
when I went through that I was

1264.729 --> 1269.3890000000001
psychologically absolutely rejecting

1267.349 --> 1274.97
Flat Earth and all of it and it was more

1269.389 --> 1277.399
or rather not exactly it I would reject

1274.97 --> 1278.989
anything that would tell me in a direct

1277.399 --> 1282.139
sense that the globe in outer space

1278.989 --> 1284.0900000000001
could not be real so I was busying as a

1282.139 --> 1286.039
box basically the baller reflects about

1284.09 --> 1293.869
pretty open-minded and it was still

1286.039 --> 1296.809
trying to learn but it was just very

1293.869 --> 1301.009
confusing as to how to interpret what is

1296.809 --> 1304.299
going on based on the biblical

1301.009 --> 1306.83
information and and then

1304.299 --> 1310.46
cross-referencing it with experiences

1306.83 --> 1312.759
that people have described like even

1310.46 --> 1315.559
experiences in using the drugs or

1312.759 --> 1318.47
meditations or just spiritual things

1315.559 --> 1321.32
with the other beings and my own

1318.47 --> 1324.169
experiences added as I was weirdly

1321.32 --> 1327.22
enough as it was attempted to teach me

1324.169 --> 1331.1290000000001
something about it in that actual world

1327.22 --> 1334.279
when I was not too open for it I think

1331.129 --> 1336.6789999999999
in retrospect it was probably trying to

1334.279 --> 1340.249
show me things that are actually now in

1336.679 --> 1343.039
this time period happening that I was

1340.249 --> 1347.1490000000001
just absolutely not ready for and maybe

1343.039 --> 1350.509
it was kind of a hopeful attempt to try

1347.149 --> 1352.9599999999998
to change me preemptively to prevent me

1350.509 --> 1356.69
from going through this long period of

1352.96 --> 1359.539
slowly letting it sink in but it seems

1356.69 --> 1361.929
like it was just not meant to be any

1359.539 --> 1361.929
other way

1364.39 --> 1367.459
[Music]

1375.809 --> 1383.289
right well michael roark look that's the

1378.58 --> 1386.1999999999998
thing when you say might have been yeah

1383.289 --> 1388.75
welcome to the wide wide world of

1386.2 --> 1391.14
biblical speculations about the parts

1388.75 --> 1394.779
that are no have no clarity to them and

1391.14 --> 1397.179
you betcha there is book works probably

1394.779 --> 1400.409
pretty early on there might have been

1397.179 --> 1403.419
even much more I think to be honest I

1400.409 --> 1408.0100000000002
think there probably originally was a

1403.419 --> 1414.19
book of the gods that actually totally

1408.01 --> 1418.57
laid it out how did an even could

1414.19 --> 1421.5700000000002
probably lay out how the god of Christ's

1418.57 --> 1424.269
came who that was with it how it really

1421.57 --> 1427.149
works and just how it all were it was

1424.269 --> 1429.49
probably there at some point probably

1427.149 --> 1431.9499999999998
one book that was just book that was

1429.49 --> 1434.549
decided to be utterly destroyed and

1431.95 --> 1438.6390000000001
guess who would be doing such a thing

1434.549 --> 1444.309
well those groups of people that are

1438.639 --> 1447.1589999999999
obsessed with becoming gods and at the

1444.309 --> 1451.72
same time deny that the actual gods are

1447.159 --> 1454.2990000000002
there so those who did yeah that would

1451.72 --> 1456.96
be their prime motivation to destroy the

1454.299 --> 1460.84
proof the knowledge of the actual gods

1456.96 --> 1467.019
and they might have left Christianity

1460.84 --> 1469.6
that part alone because they that one

1467.019 --> 1471.039
part of the people that involve

1469.6 --> 1474.4599999999998
themselves with it thought they could

1471.039 --> 1476.95
use it the ego part well at the same

1474.46 --> 1480.46
time the people just realized look this

1476.95 --> 1482.8600000000001
is the best part of it all as long as

1480.46 --> 1485.409
they just don't try to destroy that will

1482.86 --> 1487.809
be alright and we'll go with it

1485.409 --> 1492.3700000000001
we'll take peace with the dark side that

1487.809 --> 1495.52
is accompanying us in order to to

1492.37 --> 1499.4499999999998
survive and try again that kind of

1495.52 --> 1502.72
thought but I do think that there was

1499.45 --> 1504.8500000000001
probably more materials that explain a

1502.72 --> 1508.659
lot of what is not in the Bible

1504.85 --> 1509.59
I wonder if one day some of those books

1508.659 --> 1513.159
would pop up

1509.59 --> 1516.1299999999999
I doubt it there's other books of course

1513.159 --> 1518.74
that are not directly recognized as

1516.13 --> 1525.159
biblical that are seem very much related

1518.74 --> 1529.63
period-wise at least but those do not so

1525.159 --> 1533.259
far fill in that specific gap as in who

1529.63 --> 1537.3700000000001
are the sons of God and what is the

1533.259 --> 1542.6490000000001
deity lineage what did they actually do

1537.37 --> 1546.61
in that period except for just yeah make

1542.649 --> 1549.1589999999999
sons with with the daughters of man and

1546.61 --> 1550.99
then that those sons would be turned

1549.159 --> 1554.6200000000001
into giants and things went out of

1550.99 --> 1563.35
control but that part was elaborated

1554.62 --> 1567.82
upon a bit but what about the rest no

1563.35 --> 1570.6589999999999
Tony okay look shadow people shadow

1567.82 --> 1575.799
people actually comes from the more

1570.659 --> 1578.159
dimensional related alien probably

1575.799 --> 1583.12
Tavistock Institute originally based

1578.159 --> 1585.6100000000001
creations it is more just like a lit

1583.12 --> 1588.34
Sanh alternative conceptualization to

1585.61 --> 1590.019
aliens it's like okay we have the grace

1588.34 --> 1593.74
from other planets

1590.019 --> 1595.269
Zeta reticulan blah blah blah and then

1593.74 --> 1597.1490000000001
there's oh there's also the shadow

1595.269 --> 1599.769
people sightings just the black

1597.149 --> 1601.6589999999999
silhouette presumed to be from the

1599.769 --> 1604.08
shadow dimension the dark world whatever

1601.659 --> 1608.71
and not the physical world as we know it

1604.08 --> 1610.12
yeah I have had kind of experiences

1608.71 --> 1612.72
personally even when I was very young

1610.12 --> 1615.9699999999998
that seemed very similar to that but

1612.72 --> 1618.73
that what they put out about the shadow

1615.97 --> 1622.69
people seems like a cover story for a

1618.73 --> 1625.35
more natural spiritual phenomena based

1622.69 --> 1625.3500000000001
thing

1626.36 --> 1635.75
I don't think that they are literally oh

1630.85 --> 1639.529
and entities that are like I think that

1635.75 --> 1643.279
probably those entities probably are or

1639.529 --> 1645.35
have been human so they're not some kind

1643.279 --> 1647.179
of aliens from the other dimension not

1645.35 --> 1650.149
like that at all and every time I

1647.179 --> 1653.51
mentioned look there are these separate

1650.149 --> 1655.5189999999998
consciousnesses that I experienced in

1653.51 --> 1657.86
the dark world that were obviously not

1655.519 --> 1661.1
me even though they were basically in my

1657.86 --> 1665.7199999999998
mind accompanying me in that vision

1661.1 --> 1668.6
process they do not they were not the

1665.72 --> 1671.38
shadow people they were separate

1668.6 --> 1675.01
consciousness that were extremely

1671.38 --> 1680.029
flexible in in what they could do but

1675.01 --> 1684.86
they had very little sensibility human

1680.029 --> 1690.44
nature sensibility that guide their

1684.86 --> 1693.019
actions socially towards me that is what

1690.44 --> 1698.019
I noticed most about it but it's nothing

1693.019 --> 1698.019
like in shadow people so

1705.15 --> 1715.0500000000002
that's messed up sounds like a nightmare

1707.82 --> 1717.1499999999999
look external entities even they can

1715.05 --> 1720.93
mess with you in nightmares very easily

1717.15 --> 1724.0800000000002
if you're vulnerable to them and I

1720.93 --> 1728.1000000000001
haven't had a painful nightmare for a

1724.08 --> 1730.11
long time I have Restless dreams but

1728.1 --> 1732.3
they can't really get to me because it's

1730.11 --> 1735.3
funny it's funny because even when I'm

1732.3 --> 1740.27
dreaming I recognize external entities

1735.3 --> 1743.1299999999999
and immediately as if I am awake go and

1740.27 --> 1745.92
utilize my consciousness so I have like

1743.13 --> 1749.4
dream reflexes now and they can't really

1745.92 --> 1751.44
do anything it's almost to me it's very

1749.4 --> 1753.0
funny not to compare the [ __ ] it's

1751.44 --> 1757.559
almost to me like in the dream it's like

1753.0 --> 1760.61
okay there's a hostile entity okay just

1757.559 --> 1763.29
turn off the holodeck

1760.61 --> 1768.86
that's literally almost what I do and

1763.29 --> 1771.6599999999999
then I just awake so it's so easy like

1768.86 --> 1779.8799999999999
actual nightmares don't haunt me anymore

1771.66 --> 1782.6100000000001
because I have control reflexes security

1779.88 --> 1785.8200000000002
protocols within my dreaming standard

1782.61 --> 1788.1899999999998
and my wielded by myself conscious I

1785.82 --> 1791.1299999999999
don't have to be consciously thinking

1788.19 --> 1793.05
about it for that to happen it's very

1791.13 --> 1796.6100000000001
tough yeah it's just like social

1793.05 --> 1796.61
interaction anyway

1804.909 --> 1807.909
okay

1812.21 --> 1816.919
all right what are you okay the concept

1814.7 --> 1818.72
of guides in the other world is

1816.919 --> 1823.029
something different because that is

1818.72 --> 1829.059
actually a conscious waking experience

1823.029 --> 1834.529
nothing like the dark world and yeah

1829.059 --> 1836.84
that that also exists but that is very

1834.529 --> 1840.11
also very different from shadow people

1836.84 --> 1844.4599999999998
that that is just the Internet of the

1840.11 --> 1851.2099999999998
spirit available for those that have the

1844.46 --> 1853.8500000000001
senses to pick it up that is not like a

1851.21 --> 1856.22
you could compare it to a hallucination

1853.85 --> 1860.809
based effect where you will actually see

1856.22 --> 1864.23
the things it's nothing like that I have

1860.809 --> 1866.36
the sensitivity I can pick up spirit

1864.23 --> 1869.749
things and motivations and thoughts

1866.36 --> 1872.57
sometimes even from people not just

1869.749 --> 1875.059
entities rarely deal with entities

1872.57 --> 1876.519
anyway they don't they can't catch me so

1875.059 --> 1879.32
they leave me alone most of the time

1876.519 --> 1881.029
except for those in people struggling to

1879.32 --> 1887.6589999999999
get out when I confront them with this

1881.029 --> 1892.97
shining bright truth but yeah I don't

1887.659 --> 1896.8990000000001
really see or even have the need to see

1892.97 --> 1900.409
entities because I feel them and I know

1896.899 --> 1904.07
they're there I could focus to basically

1900.409 --> 1907.24
get my visuals attuned to it as well I

1904.07 --> 1907.24
don't need to

1918.149 --> 1928.079
okay well toady UK at least we agree on

1921.179 --> 1930.0890000000002
that shadow people and dark world

1928.079 --> 1932.209
entities are not the same thing glad we

1930.089 --> 1932.2089999999998
agree

1939.61 --> 1947.1
yeah oh by the way I tried to find my

1943.24 --> 1951.43
copy of Skyrim and I can't find it

1947.1 --> 1957.55
so for some reason I left it in the

1951.43 --> 1960.88
other box in storage yeah I must I must

1957.55 --> 1963.69
have the game somewhere yeah so it could

1960.88 --> 1966.69
take a while before I can get that

1963.69 --> 1966.69
unfortunately

1973.22 --> 1976.41
[Music]

1985.76 --> 1989.2
get it on Steam

1993.13 --> 2001.0490000000002
no I'm not craving to play Skyrim

1995.73 --> 2005.91
absolutely not but I am curious to see

2001.049 --> 2008.6399999999999
if the environment without without the

2005.91 --> 2010.5
combat elements with them taken away if

2008.64 --> 2013.26
they're if the environment is actually

2010.5 --> 2016.95
if it will hold up as well as I remember

2013.26 --> 2022.23
it did just the visuals I know I was

2016.95 --> 2024.059
very impressed back then but I'm just

2022.23 --> 2026.669
wondering if it'll still hold up

2024.059 --> 2028.86
it'll probably definitely it'll

2026.669 --> 2032.5800000000002
definitely hold up comparing it to the

2028.86 --> 2035.7299999999998
visuals that I'm using now in the

2032.58 --> 2041.789
backdrop know that for sure it's either

2035.73 --> 2046.98
to this level or better this looks

2041.789 --> 2050.7599999999998
almost more like oblivion era graphics

2046.98 --> 2053.55
which was the game preceding Skyrim a

2050.76 --> 2055.53
couple of years before that and that was

2053.55 --> 2057.96
the first one that had like very

2055.53 --> 2060.3
extensive animated grass and all that

2057.96 --> 2063.96
and this looks kind of like that well

2060.3 --> 2068.6690000000003
Skyrim was just better it's much more

2063.96 --> 2072.33
detailed it was pretty astounding

2068.669 --> 2074.52
I remember just that you could just get

2072.33 --> 2076.859
a little spot somewhere see something

2074.52 --> 2077.58
like a plant and then just try to zoom

2076.859 --> 2081.0
in on it

2077.58 --> 2084.119
and you'd be amazed like what it is

2081.0 --> 2086.76
actually has so much detail just this

2084.119 --> 2089.94
freaky little bit but they use some

2086.76 --> 2092.19
system to I guess when you zoom in on

2089.94 --> 2094.53
something review more details almost

2092.19 --> 2097.56
fractal like system it was it was

2094.53 --> 2099.63
brilliant now I'm very curious to see if

2097.56 --> 2102.2999999999997
it'll still hold up that I remember it

2099.63 --> 2105.96
did but yeah it's not gonna happen right

2102.3 --> 2108.53
now because I can't find the disk to

2105.96 --> 2108.53
install it

2110.73 --> 2113.73
yeah

2129.58 --> 2137.25
oh really Kenny Cleary and what does he

2133.33 --> 2137.25
actually use as a source for that

2162.94 --> 2169.0
yep the issue is is that as I said there

2166.78 --> 2172.96
should be plenty of people out there

2169.0 --> 2177.579
that have their own versions of how they

2172.96 --> 2180.01
see what it all means but I want data I

2177.579 --> 2182.8900000000003
don't want to start believing somebody

2180.01 --> 2186.67
else's interpretation I'm trying to

2182.89 --> 2193.42
build my own but I want more actual data

2186.67 --> 2197.799
I don't want to accidentally start

2193.42 --> 2202.839
believing yeah other people's beliefs

2197.799 --> 2205.059
due to a lack of the evidence alt text

2202.839 --> 2212.92
but what alt text were they actually

2205.059 --> 2217.599
recognized and who who received those

2212.92 --> 2220.92
texts who has been managing the history

2217.599 --> 2224.17
you always got a look at that you know

2220.92 --> 2227.17
like the group that deals with the data

2224.17 --> 2231.039
and reveals it historically and it's all

2227.17 --> 2234.579
recorded that reveals a lot as to what

2231.039 --> 2236.5890000000004
is going on because all these groups

2234.579 --> 2241.8390000000004
have their agendas and that are very

2236.589 --> 2246.88
specific so just by the involvement

2241.839 --> 2250.24
you can already deduce a range of

2246.88 --> 2253.4500000000003
options of as to what they might have

2250.24 --> 2257.25
been doing and what they will definitely

2253.45 --> 2262.0589999999997
want things to go in a certain direction

2257.25 --> 2264.849
so plenty of data out there well yeah

2262.059 --> 2267.2400000000002
sure I'd love to dig through that I

2264.849 --> 2267.2400000000002
guess

2270.58 --> 2274.41
I just want to be very careful

2292.31 --> 2302.04
hello chocolate yeah chocolate me Riley

2299.13 --> 2305.88
and rumpus funnily enough had a really

2302.04 --> 2309.12
very long back drop conversation over

2305.88 --> 2311.88
Skype and it was really good and also I

2309.12 --> 2312.63
invited him and Riley and chocolate too

2311.88 --> 2316.38
if he wants to

2312.63 --> 2319.44
so come on a Skype panel with me on the

2316.38 --> 2324.2000000000003
early bird show and see if we can get

2319.44 --> 2326.37
that same level of just gentlemanly

2324.2 --> 2329.5499999999997
conversation and discussion going on

2326.37 --> 2331.56
about concerning globe evidences and all

2329.55 --> 2336.78
that and yeah rumpus is gonna presuppose

2331.56 --> 2340.0499999999997
a lot like unusual amounts you we know

2336.78 --> 2344.01
he is very religiously defiant and set

2340.05 --> 2346.05
in his ways but yeah that doesn't mean

2344.01 --> 2350.9100000000003
that we can't have a great conversation

2346.05 --> 2357.1400000000003
with because of it and yeah I don't know

2350.91 --> 2361.44
when he's gonna take debate literally

2357.14 --> 2364.29
but yeah we might see him and Riley and

2361.44 --> 2365.93
maybe chocolate over here on the early

2364.29 --> 2369.56
bird show sometime in the near future

2365.93 --> 2369.56
looking forward to it

2375.849 --> 2386.4700000000003
yeah the I Yad you just put down yeah I

2386.65 --> 2394.64
wouldn't be surprised it is kind of

2391.099 --> 2398.15
already the rumor that that is yeah the

2394.64 --> 2400.8489999999997
basics of how things have proceeded that

2398.15 --> 2403.31
yeah that the the Vatican's basically

2400.849 --> 2406.01
has assimilated all the ancient texts

2403.31 --> 2408.83
and then destroyed it and hey we know

2406.01 --> 2413.4100000000003
historically that Jesuits were literally

2408.83 --> 2418.7799999999997
sent around around throughout the realm

2413.41 --> 2421.31
to target religious leaders and

2418.78 --> 2427.869
manipulate them and blackmail them and

2421.31 --> 2427.869
kill them in order to change the texts

2429.01 --> 2435.8300000000004
but what we also know is that I said

2432.56 --> 2437.599
what well that I know I don't even know

2435.83 --> 2439.49
if I'm supposed to be knowing that but I

2437.599 --> 2441.17
think that Jesuits what they do they

2439.49 --> 2443.8999999999996
don't just destroy knowledge they

2441.17 --> 2446.48
assimilated and then they destroyed the

2443.9 --> 2450.4700000000003
proof of it as they try to figure it out

2446.48 --> 2452.21
and then store it it's like that's what

2450.47 --> 2454.8489999999997
they do that's also what the Vatican

2452.21 --> 2458.03
that has been presumed to be the great

2454.849 --> 2459.589
library of the Jesuits that holds all

2458.03 --> 2467.4500000000003
the secret knowledge that they have

2459.589 --> 2469.75
erased see so yeah I can definitely go

2467.45 --> 2469.75
with that

2483.19 --> 2491.2200000000003
oh really I don't know what assimilate

2485.44 --> 2495.48
means I use that word very specifically

2491.22 --> 2498.3399999999997
assimilating means you make it your own

2495.48 --> 2500.41
that's what they do they absorb the

2498.34 --> 2502.65
knowledge they master it and then they

2500.41 --> 2506.02
erase it

2502.65 --> 2512.35
yeah assimilate that's exactly what that

2506.02 --> 2514.84
is yeah right it's good that you googled

2512.35 --> 2521.14
that but I actually really understand

2514.84 --> 2534.27
the word that's the difference borac and

2521.14 --> 2538.33
Vatican you know come to think of it if

2534.27 --> 2542.32
start putting out some conspiracy ideas

2538.33 --> 2545.89
look if Skynet is ever gonna surface

2542.32 --> 2549.19
somewhere it's probably gonna be in one

2545.89 --> 2554.92
of the hidden basements of the Vatican

2549.19 --> 2559.78
that makes absolute sense because they

2554.92 --> 2562.3
would absolutely be applying and using

2559.78 --> 2564.07
forbidden secret technology that's just

2562.3 --> 2567.52
a hundred thousand times better than

2564.07 --> 2574.3
anything at this time even if there

2567.52 --> 2577.24
would be risks to it if it has a purpose

2574.3 --> 2586.03
on the long scale on the bigger plan

2577.24 --> 2588.0699999999997
that guides it all what they do so but

2586.03 --> 2589.9
anyway I done per I think personally

2588.07 --> 2593.02
think that don't there will not be a

2589.9 --> 2596.65
Skynet like situation doesn't really I

2593.02 --> 2601.8
think that is the part of the accidental

2596.65 --> 2604.51
conscious I think that is a fantasy

2601.8 --> 2608.1400000000003
concerning robotics and electronics that

2604.51 --> 2613.7200000000003
people have made as a new boogeyman for

2608.14 --> 2616.9
the new realm to create suspicion in

2613.72 --> 2620.29
and fair in order yeah to prevent people

2616.9 --> 2626.9500000000003
from ascending in their understanding of

2620.29 --> 2630.69
what it really is too fast so I don't

2626.95 --> 2633.8799999999997
think there will be a Skynet situation

2630.69 --> 2636.73
what there probably will be is just a

2633.88 --> 2640.0
eyes that are so perfect at hacking that

2636.73 --> 2642.609
nothing can prevent those wielding it

2640.0 --> 2645.55
from just figuring out whatever they

2642.609 --> 2647.74
want that is gonna be probably the

2645.55 --> 2651.25
primary problem is that once the AI is

2647.74 --> 2654.75
become really strong enough that privacy

2651.25 --> 2658.869
is just over forever this is nothing

2654.75 --> 2662.47
like anarchy level that is going to be a

2658.869 --> 2664.3
problem with AI because encryptions all

2662.47 --> 2667.24
gonna be completely worthless no matter

2664.3 --> 2671.2000000000003
what you try to conceive and what the

2667.24 --> 2675.3999999999996
mechanism is going to be mmm but it's

2671.2 --> 2678.0989999999997
not gonna build a military coup like

2675.4 --> 2682.2400000000002
situation you know if anything that's

2678.099 --> 2684.31
gonna do military coup mechanically will

2682.24 --> 2686.56
have to be designed by humans

2684.31 --> 2696.849
specifically to do that and those humans

2686.56 --> 2699.609
would be messed up and well then it

2696.849 --> 2705.25
would be them it would not be an

2699.609 --> 2706.96
accident for it to become the way it is

2705.25 --> 2711.119
and do the things to do it would have to

2706.96 --> 2711.119
be programmed specifically to do that

2713.16 --> 2720.2799999999997
that's what I think and I don't think

2716.74 --> 2725.609
that I think there's already so much

2720.28 --> 2725.6090000000004
security concerning really serious AI

2725.64 --> 2733.0
that yeah that anybody wielding that

2731.23 --> 2736.08
kind of stuff is just not gonna let that

2733.0 --> 2736.08
kind of thing slip in

2741.54 --> 2748.969
anyway there's technical stuff

2745.8 --> 2748.969
[Music]

2753.51 --> 2756.51
mmm

2758.42 --> 2766.61
okay

2760.97 --> 2770.62
if you say so does studio well you you

2766.61 --> 2776.96
know that the way I see and even is that

2770.62 --> 2779.72
there's a likelihood that the Jesuits

2776.96 --> 2784.1
what Jesuit is it's not even that it's

2779.72 --> 2789.3199999999997
just that the Roman Catholics the ones

2784.1 --> 2794.74
that made that medieval period religious

2789.32 --> 2801.38
order become the way it is I think that

2794.74 --> 2804.89
that they probably made like remade

2801.38 --> 2808.46
maybe from old words or from scratch

2804.89 --> 2815.81
designed language they made Roman they

2808.46 --> 2819.61
made that language to conceal it I think

2815.81 --> 2821.96
that that is I think there's just

2819.61 --> 2823.73
information I don't think that rome ever

2821.96 --> 2827.51
exists in the way that it is

2823.73 --> 2830.7400000000002
historically portrayed grave great

2827.51 --> 2830.7400000000002
suspicion about it

2840.01 --> 2844.2900000000004
all right oh yeah

2861.79 --> 2883.48
hmm yeah the Greeks well if you think

2877.12 --> 2886.24
about it it's just logical that the

2883.48 --> 2894.1
Romans basically assimilated the Greeks

2886.24 --> 2897.31
and then the first process was to undo

2894.1 --> 2899.7999999999997
the Greek versions of it and replace it

2897.31 --> 2901.45
by Roman so that the common man wouldn't

2899.8 --> 2905.29
be able to understand it anymore

2901.45 --> 2908.77
and make it a priest knowledge exclusive

2905.29 --> 2916.0299999999997
thing I really think that's what

2908.77 --> 2918.82
happened I think Roman was never a

2916.03 --> 2920.6800000000003
really living language it was a code

2918.82 --> 2923.5
language it was an artificial language

2920.68 --> 2927.99
created to specifically conceal

2923.5 --> 2927.99
knowledge that's what I think

2931.339 --> 2936.819
maybe technical anyways this

2954.85 --> 2962.42
Lattin right yeah sorry I mean Latin

2959.36 --> 2965.15
Latin is the language of the suppose at

2962.42 --> 2968.84
Roman Empire and I don't think that

2965.15 --> 2971.36
Latin is or whatever really was a living

2968.84 --> 2977.3
language I think it was specifically

2971.36 --> 2980.3900000000003
constructed from scratch as a secret

2977.3 --> 2983.3300000000004
language probably even forbidden if they

2980.39 --> 2986.8689999999997
caught non priests trying to speak it

2983.33 --> 2992.27
they would probably then yeah kill them

2986.869 --> 2995.36
or something that's what I think I think

2992.27 --> 3000.16
that Latin may have been like the secret

2995.36 --> 3004.0
druid language of that that religious

3000.16 --> 3006.79
group like - drew its I think there is

3004.0 --> 3009.369
something that they had secret language

3006.79 --> 3012.7599999999998
as well that they wielded for their

3009.369 --> 3016.63
priesthood secret lethal secret and that

3012.76 --> 3018.19
that is kind of what the Roman Church

3016.63 --> 3024.359
did as well

3018.19 --> 3024.359
they had their secret language Latin

3036.36 --> 3040.32
anyway yeah maybe this sounds just

3038.79 --> 3046.5
really silly to a lot of people but

3040.32 --> 3048.42
that's kind of I'm trying to put it

3046.5 --> 3050.4
together just because when I say like

3048.42 --> 3053.04
yeah I don't believe in the Roman Empire

3050.4 --> 3055.88
and all that it's just like oh but all

3053.04 --> 3058.71
that material I learned in school and

3055.88 --> 3061.83
right well I'm not saying that there was

3058.71 --> 3067.26
absolutely nothing going on of any sort

3061.83 --> 3071.13
I'm just saying that it's made to look

3067.26 --> 3073.2900000000004
in a certain fashion to suggest this

3071.13 --> 3076.8
unified Empire and I think that that

3073.29 --> 3078.7799999999997
part is the lie I don't say that there's

3076.8 --> 3081.86
nothing like that they were there

3078.78 --> 3086.46
weren't Romans that there wasn't that

3081.86 --> 3087.9300000000003
that military system that they that has

3086.46 --> 3090.15
been registered and the the

3087.93 --> 3093.33
registrations and all that being

3090.15 --> 3095.4900000000002
bureaucratic I'm not saying that nothing

3093.33 --> 3097.71
like that existed but it may not have

3095.49 --> 3101.79
been this unified Empire it may have

3097.71 --> 3104.64
just been situational or even yeah a

3101.79 --> 3107.84
group of conquerors that would literally

3104.64 --> 3117.72
try to enslave entire groups of people

3107.84 --> 3121.2000000000003
as yeah as self-appointed priests you

3117.72 --> 3123.89
know with their own religion that they

3121.2 --> 3123.89
were building

3127.43 --> 3139.1699999999996
so it is also I'll just think about it

3136.17 --> 3143.64
you know how how did you learn that the

3139.17 --> 3147.87
Roman Empire came into being right so

3143.64 --> 3150.5699999999997
there was Romulus and Remus that were

3147.87 --> 3157.47
just left in the wild and then raised by

3150.57 --> 3165.8300000000004
a wolf and they became the starters of

3157.47 --> 3170.9399999999996
this heavy organized type culture how

3165.83 --> 3175.46
its it seems very unlikely to me that

3170.94 --> 3181.8
that is really that any of that is real

3175.46 --> 3184.38
seems weird off and it doesn't flow into

3181.8 --> 3185.82
what actually comes out of that it seems

3184.38 --> 3190.25
like there's a much more complicated

3185.82 --> 3195.38
politics and all kinds of history

3190.25 --> 3195.38
preceding what it all turned out

3201.21 --> 3215.53
anyway yeah the fascist technology well

3210.85 --> 3218.89
Romans were neo Atlanteans pretty sure

3215.53 --> 3222.19
of that that's what they are still kind

3218.89 --> 3225.58
of now in a way the keeper of the old

3222.19 --> 3229.9500000000003
tech ancient tech and appliers but

3225.58 --> 3232.54
having concealing the knowledge of it

3229.95 --> 3234.9399999999996
it's the trick that's the trick they do

3232.54 --> 3237.49
it is the I think it is also

3234.94 --> 3242.9700000000003
fundamentally Phoenician to do that only

3237.49 --> 3245.5299999999997
Phoenicians have more cultural specific

3242.97 --> 3253.6
philosophies to guide them in a very

3245.53 --> 3257.3500000000004
dark way yeah yeah I don't think the

3253.6 --> 3259.9
Coliseum is what they say it was I've

3257.35 --> 3261.54
been hearing of conceptualizations that

3259.9 --> 3265.9500000000003
Coliseum like buildings and

3261.54 --> 3271.41
amphitheaters especially are not

3265.95 --> 3280.18
theaters but rather you have

3271.41 --> 3281.95
reconstructed water aggregates that they

3280.18 --> 3287.16
were actually designed to store water

3281.95 --> 3291.6699999999996
and probably from Atlantean times and

3287.16 --> 3295.0299999999997
that they were then rebuilt in two

3291.67 --> 3298.96
theaters perhaps but that was not the

3295.03 --> 3301.5600000000004
original design of it of those things I

3298.96 --> 3301.56
think

3303.96 --> 3315.7400000000002
and the Colosseum I'm not too sure what

3308.01 --> 3318.78
that was right the atom Eakin yeah

3315.74 --> 3322.3199999999997
technical devices from the Atlantean

3318.78 --> 3325.6800000000003
times and they just reused them like

3322.32 --> 3330.05
that or hey maybe the Romans did just

3325.68 --> 3333.6
freaking restart reusing the remnants of

3330.05 --> 3336.0600000000004
Atlantis properly that they did

3333.6 --> 3338.99
understand how what they were and what

3336.06 --> 3342.09
and did just use them in secret so they

3338.99 --> 3344.04
restarted the old devices and nobody

3342.09 --> 3345.54
would even realize that was going on and

3344.04 --> 3350.91
they were reaping the fruits of it or

3345.54 --> 3353.31
whatever and yeah they would keep the

3350.91 --> 3355.62
record of the utilization of this

3353.31 --> 3358.74
antiquity tech stuff to themselves and

3355.62 --> 3363.7999999999997
right cover stories for what they were

3358.74 --> 3363.7999999999997
themselves now that would make sense

3370.28 --> 3377.17
so much so much pain

3373.58 --> 3377.17
what is justifying that

3387.21 --> 3396.0
mmm-hmm Coliseum hosted the games dude

3391.25 --> 3400.46
well that is what as I said look the

3396.0 --> 3403.26
Coliseum may have been an old device

3400.46 --> 3406.38
Antiqua tech device as well that was

3403.26 --> 3408.48
just not fixable anymore so then they

3406.38 --> 3412.9500000000003
might have actually turned it into an

3408.48 --> 3415.05
arena who knows you know that's the

3412.95 --> 3418.109
funny thing when you have things whether

3415.05 --> 3420.78
you build them or not you can always try

3418.109 --> 3423.2999999999997
to recycle their purpose for something

3420.78 --> 3426.69
else it's much much easier than just

3423.3 --> 3428.55
removing it which probably in a lot of

3426.69 --> 3434.0
the cases they just couldn't it was just

3428.55 --> 3437.04
too much too heavy rocks from a period

3434.0 --> 3439.29
when they could easily manipulate them

3437.04 --> 3445.41
and build all that stuff but the Romans

3439.29 --> 3448.77
probably were yeah with great hassle

3445.41 --> 3451.47
trying to keep up applying the antiquity

3448.77 --> 3453.78
in a setting where it wasn't ideal

3451.47 --> 3455.9399999999996
anymore there were probably all these

3453.78 --> 3459.3900000000003
devices and all the techniques will all

3455.94 --> 3461.13
be amplified by active pyramid by active

3459.39 --> 3463.47
energy in the air that's typically how

3461.13 --> 3465.1800000000003
Tesla things work they just pick up the

3463.47 --> 3466.7099999999996
energies or whatever they do they will

3465.18 --> 3470.609
have more energy available if that

3466.71 --> 3472.65
energy is there then that time wasn't

3470.609 --> 3475.2599999999998
there the flood happened all these

3472.65 --> 3478.44
things were off the remnants of them

3475.26 --> 3480.1800000000003
were there but yet so the Romans may

3478.44 --> 3483.299
have used some of these tools to do

3480.18 --> 3486.839
things but they would not be as

3483.299 --> 3489.68
efficient as in the original setting

3486.839 --> 3489.68
that's all I'm saying

3493.99 --> 3497.0699999999997
[Music]

3498.4 --> 3504.85
right I heard that yeah the studio that

3501.92 --> 3504.85
is amazing

3505.03 --> 3511.9100000000003
filling it with water and moksha bells

3507.98 --> 3515.69
as a theatre it's amazing

3511.91 --> 3519.17
I love it's a really funny idea actually

3515.69 --> 3520.58
I thought I remember that it was on one

3519.17 --> 3525.2200000000003
of more than leafless [ __ ] I remember

3520.58 --> 3525.22
that that was a pretty interesting idea

3526.18 --> 3534.1699999999996
yeah I agree duh Studios 68 and the

3530.87 --> 3537.35
pyramids in my opinion were absolutely

3534.17 --> 3541.91
pre-flood they were probably part of the

3537.35 --> 3546.02
constructs that were made by the

3541.91 --> 3548.3199999999997
Atlanteans and well the gods you could

3546.02 --> 3552.2
say you know sometimes I wonder now if

3548.32 --> 3556.73
the Atlanteans were basically the sons

3552.2 --> 3561.04
of God taking the helm more directly in

3556.73 --> 3563.45
in creation and applying the divine

3561.04 --> 3565.85
aspects from a more personified

3563.45 --> 3570.83
perspective doing things and the

3565.85 --> 3574.0
original designer disagreed said no that

3570.83 --> 3577.0699999999997
is absolutely that's never been the plan

3574.0 --> 3578.81
you're going to destroy it you're going

3577.07 --> 3582.44
to destroy the meaning of it you're

3578.81 --> 3586.61
gonna like it does make sense in a way

3582.44 --> 3589.43
because obviously humans or separately

3586.61 --> 3592.31
create it and they carry kind of the

3589.43 --> 3594.1099999999997
purpose of it all of they are the ones

3592.31 --> 3599.0299999999997
that have to evolve as it were

3594.11 --> 3601.07
spiritually and if the gods the sons of

3599.03 --> 3602.8100000000004
God would then just take the helm and

3601.07 --> 3605.27
make the decisions yeah you would take

3602.81 --> 3607.88
the way there are all purpose of why it

3605.27 --> 3610.84
was designed like it in the first place

3607.88 --> 3615.1400000000003
so that does kind of make sense a bit

3610.84 --> 3617.38
from a technical philosophical angle as

3615.14 --> 3617.3799999999997
it were

3617.99 --> 3624.8399999999997
anyway I think I'm gonna round out the

3620.1 --> 3627.7799999999997
show now it's bit all over the place huh

3624.84 --> 3629.19

3659.22 --> 3664.35
I indeed michael roark and yeah I'm

3662.94 --> 3666.39
gonna join the Flat Earth debates right

3664.35 --> 3668.37
after this should already should start

3666.39 --> 3669.69
up any second now and I'll be back

3668.37 --> 3674.3399999999997

number 339 so until the next video keep

3674.34 --> 3677.09
it flat
