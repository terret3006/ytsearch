yeah today the weather is

76.32 --> 79.91999999999999
yeah it was mostly just very windy it's

79.36 --> 83.6
not

79.92 --> 87.36
even cold hence me sitting in a shirt

83.6 --> 91.83999999999999
it does get clouded and yeah it's like

87.36 --> 93.52
constant wind going on

91.84 --> 97.52000000000001
but it hasn't been raining for a while

93.52 --> 97.52
so it's not as moist anymore i think

98.84 --> 105.36
anyway

101.36 --> 109.68
yeah and i feel clearly more recovered

105.36 --> 112.32
than i what did yesterday i was yeah

109.68 --> 114.47900000000001
i was kind of like really flustered in a

112.32 --> 117.75899999999999
way that i'm not used to this is

114.479 --> 120.719
not the typical startup flusters

117.759 --> 121.04
and also good news by the way uh not too

120.719 --> 125.03999999999999
long

121.04 --> 128.64000000000001
after the hangout i actually found

125.04 --> 131.59900000000002
uh what is it free energy's channel

128.64 --> 134.07999999999998
it it was weird though because yeah the

131.599 --> 136.319
search results didn't give anything

134.08 --> 139.59900000000002
but the channel still exists i'm still

136.319 --> 143.35999999999999
subscribed apparently he renamed

139.599 --> 145.599
his channel into square earth cosmology

143.36 --> 147.44000000000003
but he hasn't uploaded any new video

145.599 --> 150.79999999999998
since he did that

147.44 --> 155.12
so he's still around also right after

150.8 --> 157.519
that i immediately found back the video

155.12 --> 159.59900000000002
of him that i downloaded on my computer

157.519 --> 163.36
it was still there it just

159.599 --> 164.56
didn't have any word like rectangular

163.36 --> 167.76000000000002
square no it was

164.56 --> 168.319
uh one of his videos about the moon like

167.76 --> 170.79999999999998
uh

168.319 --> 171.67999999999998
about like how the projections and all

170.8 --> 175.04000000000002
that work

171.68 --> 176.87900000000002
on the rectangular model anyway

175.04 --> 178.239
yeah it's still there so i feel a bit

176.879 --> 180.79999999999998
stupid about that

178.239 --> 181.84
being oh it's all being deleted and

180.8 --> 185.44
censored and

181.84 --> 189.599
yeah it's still there i just renamed it

185.44 --> 192.159
and yeah

189.599 --> 193.67999999999998
about the video that i downloaded still

192.159 --> 196.56
has the

193.68 --> 198.239
has the stamp from his original channel

196.56 --> 202.56

missouri bear yeah good to see you all

237.599 --> 243.76
on saturday the 6th of june

250.879 --> 258.71999999999997
so yeah a bit of a weird day yesterday

254.48 --> 258.71999999999997
it should be i expected that

258.88 --> 262.639
and i got also yeah i got really

260.88 --> 265.52
knackered like in the

262.639 --> 265.84000000000003
in the early evening really tired out it

265.52 --> 268.24
was

265.84 --> 269.75899999999996
logical i had so much muscle aches it's

268.24 --> 272.72
i still feel some of it

269.759 --> 273.91900000000004
though not as much that it just took a

272.72 --> 277.12
sleep

273.919 --> 278.32
like in the evening where was it i think

277.12 --> 282.32
it was somewhere after

278.32 --> 286.8
uh owen benjamin finished his stream

282.32 --> 289.199
which was pretty awesome and then

286.8 --> 289.84000000000003
yeah that was a weird situation my

289.199 --> 293.199
friend

289.84 --> 298.32
from nijmegen the lady with the

293.199 --> 298.32
little girl she

299.04 --> 303.6
she called me like up at 11 o'clock

301.919 --> 305.44
which is kind of unusual for her because

303.6 --> 308.84000000000003
usually she goes to bed

305.44 --> 310.56
but she was kind of upset and we talked

308.84 --> 313.84
for

310.56 --> 315.84
yeah over three hours

313.84 --> 317.52
she really had to get some things off

315.84 --> 319.84
her chest because

317.52 --> 322.4
apparently like she constantly gets

319.84 --> 325.44
confronted with people that just don't

322.4 --> 328.63899999999995
respect her motherly authority

325.44 --> 330.71999999999997
it's it's quite insane

328.639 --> 331.68
like how much that happens to her even

330.72 --> 334.56
though she is

331.68 --> 336.24
extremely dedicated and responsible and

334.56 --> 339.36
like

336.24 --> 341.759
constantly at her toes in a good way

339.36 --> 343.12
gives her daughter a lot of breathing

341.759 --> 345.759
room

343.12 --> 346.56
is really yeah pays a lot of attention

345.759 --> 349.36
anyway

346.56 --> 351.199
and yeah she constantly people just

349.36 --> 353.199
don't respect her so

351.199 --> 355.28000000000003
this time it was apparently the parents

353.199 --> 355.28000000000003
of

356.0 --> 362.639
her ex terrible guy by the way

360.0 --> 364.24
or at least heavily damaged well you

362.639 --> 365.759
remember the story from last time i was

364.24 --> 367.12
quite pissed off when i told her about

365.759 --> 370.96000000000004
that how he mis

367.12 --> 374.08
yeah brutally mistreated her

370.96 --> 377.59999999999997
but yeah her parents his parents

374.08 --> 380.24
kind of sometimes still

377.6 --> 381.36
offer up to babysit and this yeah the

380.24 --> 384.96000000000004
last time that happened

381.36 --> 384.96000000000004
which was apparently yesterday

385.199 --> 388.40000000000003
they were basically putting on the

387.199 --> 391.199
television

388.4 --> 393.039
on like really stupid news i think even

391.199 --> 396.479
like cnn

393.039 --> 397.759
and it was corona hype blah blah blah

396.479 --> 400.88
and then about

397.759 --> 404.0
yeah you know the riot situation just

400.88 --> 407.759
terrible stuff and she's like

404.0 --> 411.199
a two-year-old like

407.759 --> 414.16
no no so she was of course

411.199 --> 415.68
like hey i don't want you to put that on

414.16 --> 418.639
while she's like in the room

415.68 --> 420.56
like you i don't allow that and they

418.639 --> 424.24
just ignored it

420.56 --> 428.0
three times almost like ballers it's

424.24 --> 428.0
so yeah she was quite like

428.16 --> 432.96000000000004
why why are you doing this to me

434.96 --> 439.919
so yeah that kept me up and

438.08 --> 442.08
basically didn't see much else on the

439.919 --> 445.19899999999996
internet because of all that

442.08 --> 446.24
although yeah i also did watch uh indian

445.199 --> 450.479
dunes

446.24 --> 452.72
because yeah i don't know look back

450.479 --> 452.71999999999997
uh

455.12 --> 458.96
see the moon yeah i did see the moon

457.599 --> 465.84
right yeah let's see what you guys are

458.96 --> 465.84
talking about

473.919 --> 478.4
we didn't look completely full this

476.24 --> 481.52
morning think it's began

478.4 --> 483.35999999999996
waning oh yeah well

481.52 --> 486.0
somebody told me that yesterday was

483.36 --> 489.44
supposed to be the full moon

486.0 --> 492.24
could be i just felt that the day before

489.44 --> 496.479
it was very full or maybe it was still

492.24 --> 496.479
growing and it was just unusually bright

503.28 --> 509.35999999999996
i don't know and boomers think they

506.319 --> 509.36
drove a car on the moon

518.0 --> 521.2
yeah by the way yesterday concerning

520.479 --> 523.519
technicals

521.2 --> 525.6800000000001
and talking about flat earth and all

523.519 --> 528.64
yesterday was pretty awesome

525.68 --> 530.0799999999999
i thought never talked so much about

528.64 --> 532.3199999999999
flat earth

530.08 --> 535.839
persistently on my own show for over

532.32 --> 535.839
half a year i think

547.04 --> 553.1999999999999
amanda and the servant after dark

550.24 --> 553.2
that sounds

553.76 --> 556.959
a bit dubious but

557.12 --> 563.839
interesting idea

580.399 --> 587.2
overcast extremely windy

583.68 --> 588.399
no night sky last night right well i i

587.2 --> 590.9590000000001

thank you so much for supporting me and

634.56 --> 638.16
my show keeping me going

638.24 --> 642.72
to be fair i can really use it

640.88 --> 644.56
especially now that i'm suddenly gonna

642.72 --> 646.32
have to pay for this extra storage i

644.56 --> 648.079
don't even know how much this is gonna

646.32 --> 650.0790000000001
keep costing me like i

648.079 --> 652.2399999999999
i'm really hoping more than ever that

650.079 --> 654.7199999999999
somehow

652.24 --> 655.519
i'm gonna find this opportunity to get a

654.72 --> 658.839
better

655.519 --> 661.519
location to live in some way because

658.839 --> 663.36
or who knows you know i've had some

661.519 --> 664.9590000000001
weird ideas even about this place

663.36 --> 667.12
because i really do like this

664.959 --> 668.7199999999999
apartment it's just that all these

667.12 --> 670.5600000000001
roommates and the little room that i

668.72 --> 672.5600000000001
have but

670.56 --> 675.8389999999999
if only i had like the other rooms

672.56 --> 678.8
available to me as well but yeah that's

675.839 --> 679.7600000000001
like that it's gonna be way out of my

678.8 --> 682.8
league

679.76 --> 686.8
financially anyhow

682.8 --> 686.8
so i don't know but i really hope that i

686.88 --> 689.8389999999999
can just

690.24 --> 696.5600000000001
move on you know it's been five years

693.519 --> 698.9590000000001
five years a lot it's

696.56 --> 701.1199999999999
feels like i've half a lifetime now of

698.959 --> 702.959
course i've developed a lot here and hey

701.12 --> 704.32
flat earth you know i it really hit me

702.959 --> 706.7199999999999
here i really

704.32 --> 708.6400000000001
the thing that started over here was

706.72 --> 712.1600000000001
really role playing

708.64 --> 715.519
not just building on on books and stuff

712.16 --> 718.959
my own book of course trolls and tyrants

715.519 --> 720.16
still to be found online at my wordpress

718.959 --> 722.56
site

720.16 --> 723.92
but really playing like getting to know

722.56 --> 725.92
new players

723.92 --> 727.68
just as gamers not just getting to know

725.92 --> 729.68
them as friends and then go

727.68 --> 732.079
game but like really like looking for

729.68 --> 735.3599999999999
gamers and that worked out

732.079 --> 736.2399999999999
much better than i ever imagined got

735.36 --> 739.44
quite popular

736.24 --> 741.519
like we had like this gamer guild

739.44 --> 742.8800000000001
and then meetings and sometimes there

741.519 --> 746.0
would be like 30

742.88 --> 747.76
40 people coming there be quite

746.0 --> 749.76
interesting

747.76 --> 751.36
improvised role-playing sessions and all

749.76 --> 754.0
that and yeah

751.36 --> 755.36
anyway that started over here so like

754.0 --> 757.6
really engaging with

755.36 --> 760.399
with rpgs instead of just building the

757.6 --> 764.24
mechanics in my mind constantly

760.399 --> 766.48
uh and yes youtube i started my youtube

764.24 --> 766.48
here

766.88 --> 770.32
for that i was just watching

770.8 --> 776.8
but yeah flat earth happened

773.839 --> 777.12
and then i got pulled in wait no i've

776.8 --> 781.12
been

777.12 --> 781.12
longer than five years here damn

781.32 --> 800.399
2014. sheesh

786.24 --> 803.6800000000001
sex yes

800.399 --> 809.2
see you in the sky what

803.68 --> 809.1999999999999
small guns big heart small guns are you

812.839 --> 815.839
sure

836.88 --> 844.16
what the new normal

840.48 --> 857.839
might be no cops what

844.16 --> 857.8389999999999
where are you getting that from

869.44 --> 874.0
well that's gonna be uh

876.639 --> 885.839
quite disorderly

886.88 --> 892.24
on the other hand it is the u.s now i

890.16 --> 894.3199999999999
don't want to bite in anybody's business

892.24 --> 895.199
there but yeah you do have like guns and

894.32 --> 898.639
[ __ ]

895.199 --> 902.24
so it is more attainable

898.639 --> 905.839
but yeah the situation and all is

902.24 --> 905.839
not a good idea

907.44 --> 911.6
but but you know the whole thing about

909.44 --> 913.44
the cops is

911.6 --> 915.76
like even if they're all corrupt it's

913.44 --> 919.1990000000001
it's not like they couldn't be replaced

915.76 --> 921.519
you know like i think there's probably a

919.199 --> 925.04
lot more people out there

921.519 --> 926.639
guys that are just doing other jobs

925.04 --> 928.079
that would probably wouldn't probably

926.639 --> 930.32
mind actually

928.079 --> 932.079
being involved with the police if they

930.32 --> 935.519
just weren't so freaking corrupt

932.079 --> 938.6389999999999
and politicized all the time you know

935.519 --> 943.6
so hey if they would really get

938.639 --> 946.399
tackled big time like uh from the top

943.6 --> 947.36
that's gonna be a big operation i don't

946.399 --> 949.36
even know how

947.36 --> 950.639
how what's gonna be involved in the

949.36 --> 953.839
complications and all that

950.639 --> 955.6800000000001
is blackmail [ __ ] it's probably terrible

953.839 --> 959.1990000000001
don't even want to know

955.68 --> 963.04
but yeah once

959.199 --> 966.079
it would be or a region like the police

963.04 --> 968.639
would be the yeah uncorrupted

966.079 --> 970.3199999999999
taken down then there would probably be

968.639 --> 971.36
plenty of people that'll step up to the

970.32 --> 975.44
plate say okay

971.36 --> 978.32
finally i'll do it i'll risk it

975.44 --> 979.839
becoming a new cop in the in the new

978.32 --> 982.88
system

979.839 --> 985.12
sure so you know you should keep that in

982.88 --> 985.12
mind

986.48 --> 993.1990000000001
it's really about the control that's so

989.759 --> 994.32
yeah engrained in there like refuses to

993.199 --> 998.88
be the corruption

994.32 --> 998.88
is not gonna be easily routed

1000.99 --> 1004.09
[Music]

1004.72 --> 1009.6800000000001
there were protests in japan

1007.92 --> 1012.56
oh that's just liberal solidarity

1009.68 --> 1012.56
protests you know

1013.279 --> 1021.279
what you can see me undercover really

1017.92 --> 1023.519
sure the youtuber

1021.279 --> 1025.679
the youtuber that literally spilled his

1023.519 --> 1028.72
entire freaking life

1025.679 --> 1031.199
or almost all of it so

1028.72 --> 1033.679
enough for people to get the picture is

1031.199 --> 1039.8390000000002
gonna go on the cover yeah

1033.679 --> 1039.8390000000002
so how is that gonna work

1041.679 --> 1049.1200000000001
no i don't think that could work

1045.919 --> 1055.039
a detective well sure

1049.12 --> 1055.039
you know i but yeah people see me coming

1057.2 --> 1063.679
you know so but yeah i am good at

1061.36 --> 1064.559
figuring things out even when yeah

1063.679 --> 1067.2800000000002
people think

1064.559 --> 1068.48
they got things hidden i i can attack a

1067.28 --> 1071.52
lot

1068.48 --> 1072.48
but yeah that's you know the thing is

1071.52 --> 1074.8799999999999
once you start

1072.48 --> 1076.24
doing that kind of thing you become

1074.88 --> 1079.2800000000002
marked as in

1076.24 --> 1080.08
we yeah in the network underground it's

1079.28 --> 1083.28
like yeah that

1080.08 --> 1085.28
guy you know keep an eye out it's like

1083.28 --> 1089.9189999999999
they got their own police

1085.28 --> 1094.799
records on the dark web or whatever

1089.919 --> 1098.16
so yeah no

1094.799 --> 1102.32
i i i'm more interested in

1098.16 --> 1103.44
trying to conceive or socially engineer

1102.32 --> 1106.799
you could almost say

1103.44 --> 1110.0
it's kind of like where my talents are

1106.799 --> 1113.679
more well suited for for that

1110.0 --> 1113.679
try to just figure out how to

1114.48 --> 1118.24
re-engineer our culture our personal

1117.679 --> 1123.52
culture

1118.24 --> 1126.559
in order to fix it like i even have this

1123.52 --> 1128.24
i don't know is it a dream

1126.559 --> 1130.559
maybe it's inspired by a lot of

1128.24 --> 1133.28
christian stories about like people can

1130.559 --> 1134.48
just get caught up in dark [ __ ] and lose

1133.28 --> 1137.36
themselves and they

1134.48 --> 1140.08
just seem lost but a lot of the times

1137.36 --> 1140.08
those people

1140.16 --> 1145.52
will like give in to evil because they

1144.0 --> 1147.6
just can't handle

1145.52 --> 1149.679
what has happened to them anymore so

1147.6 --> 1152.799
they just give it up

1149.679 --> 1155.2800000000002
but in that time they're in hell

1152.799 --> 1157.039
but they just show themselves as evil

1155.28 --> 1157.76
out of self-defense because they're

1157.039 --> 1161.12
really just

1157.76 --> 1162.84
in hell and like uh yeah it's hard to

1161.12 --> 1166.1599999999999
imagine

1162.84 --> 1168.3999999999999
and yeah the idea that anyone

1166.16 --> 1170.3200000000002
could be forgiven which just blows my

1168.4 --> 1172.16
mind in in the face of things that i've

1170.32 --> 1174.24
seen

1172.16 --> 1176.96
in my mind hopefully most of it and not

1174.24 --> 1176.96
in reality

1177.36 --> 1185.039
uh that

1180.559 --> 1188.0
somehow these this sickness

1185.039 --> 1189.84
sickness of the mind that's going around

1188.0 --> 1193.36
especially in politics

1189.84 --> 1196.3999999999999
can somehow just they can be

1193.36 --> 1201.1999999999998
snapped out of it and that they can

1196.4 --> 1201.2
find a way to fix it somehow

1204.24 --> 1212.64
in the face of seemingly impossible odds

1208.159 --> 1214.159
fix something at least you know that's

1212.64 --> 1216.0800000000002
that's what i hope for because if you're

1214.159 --> 1219.0390000000002
just going to be like take them down

1216.08 --> 1219.76
kill them over yeah i have the impulses

1219.039 --> 1223.2
sometimes

1219.76 --> 1228.0
huge frustrations but

1223.2 --> 1228.0
it's just known that it doesn't work

1228.88 --> 1239.0390000000002
so it'll only lead to self-destruction

1234.24 --> 1242.88
it's like the the structural

1239.039 --> 1243.52
problems have kind of been engineered to

1242.88 --> 1248.0
not

1243.52 --> 1250.6399999999999
work in favor of those that literally

1248.0 --> 1252.64
give in to vengeance it's like it's

1250.64 --> 1256.159
built against it

1252.64 --> 1259.3600000000001
those people get trapped get yeah

1256.159 --> 1262.64
quickly spotted trapped

1259.36 --> 1266.08
disarmed and then yeah

1262.64 --> 1268.4
see so you gotta like no matter the

1266.08 --> 1270.24
aggression you feel or the injustice you

1268.4 --> 1274.0
wanna set right

1270.24 --> 1276.64
it's no use like the feeling itself

1274.0 --> 1278.32
like it is important to know that it is

1276.64 --> 1281.3600000000001
there but

1278.32 --> 1282.24
it's it's super tough to deal with it

1281.36 --> 1286.6399999999999
because

1282.24 --> 1286.64
there's just no way to

1288.799 --> 1291.84
give it what it wants

1292.32 --> 1305.84
i can't describe it any other way

1307.52 --> 1311.679
yeah you just can't do that it's no use

1310.799 --> 1314.08
for nothing

1311.679 --> 1319.8400000000001
it's it'll it's an illusion it'll bite

1314.08 --> 1319.84
yourself instead

1320.24 --> 1322.96
okay

1323.919 --> 1329.919
yeah yeah a coma virus that's okay

1327.12 --> 1331.039
all that's fine with me i'm doing good

1329.919 --> 1332.88
actually it

1331.039 --> 1335.6
it's weird the experience from the

1332.88 --> 1338.7990000000002
moving the day that it wasn't on

1335.6 --> 1339.12
it it was kind of it was very tough on

1338.799 --> 1341.12
me

1339.12 --> 1342.8799999999999
it i felt really like i was getting

1341.12 --> 1346.08
squished almost like in the

1342.88 --> 1349.3600000000001
the garbage disposal in star wars

1346.08 --> 1350.24
a new hope you know like that's how that

1349.36 --> 1352.32
felt

1350.24 --> 1355.76
but just like the craziness that they

1352.32 --> 1357.2
went through they all got out of that

1355.76 --> 1359.2
and that's kind of what it felt like to

1357.2 --> 1361.8400000000001
me in a way it's like oh god

1359.2 --> 1364.48
i have to get doing something really bad

1361.84 --> 1368.0
and was really like

1364.48 --> 1371.6
unleashing all these

1368.0 --> 1372.32
things in me bringing up back old stuff

1371.6 --> 1375.28
again

1372.32 --> 1375.76
and frustrations from previous periods

1375.28 --> 1377.9189999999999
when

1375.76 --> 1380.0
that happened to me as well and this

1377.919 --> 1382.7990000000002
time i got it under control

1380.0 --> 1385.44
much better and i could spend more of my

1382.799 --> 1388.08
attention eventually focused on my dad

1385.44 --> 1389.039
like because i don't see my dad face to

1388.08 --> 1392.48
face a lot

1389.039 --> 1394.96
and he's busy so many times that

1392.48 --> 1395.679
in a way i'm almost scared of losing

1394.96 --> 1398.72
like

1395.679 --> 1402.96
spiritual contact with him

1398.72 --> 1406.0
because he's

1402.96 --> 1406.0
he's like he's

1407.919 --> 1411.3600000000001
more zen he's distanced himself more

1410.96 --> 1414.48
from

1411.36 --> 1418.24
feelings while i am blatantly obvious

1414.48 --> 1420.72
like overflowing with passions and [ __ ]

1418.24 --> 1424.08
go and going nuts so it's like in that

1420.72 --> 1424.08
way i'm kind of the opposite

1424.32 --> 1430.3999999999999
and sometimes i'm afraid like he's just

1426.88 --> 1432.0
gonna be so zen that he's just gonna

1430.4 --> 1434.159
like it's not gonna mean anything

1432.0 --> 1436.159
anymore what i do

1434.159 --> 1437.6000000000001
but that's crazy because he's my dad of

1436.159 --> 1440.64
course

1437.6 --> 1440.6399999999999
and yeah anyway

1440.799 --> 1446.32
it's not a crossbow and it's just for

1443.36 --> 1446.32
the show that's right

1449.2 --> 1452.96
why do people always ask questions about

1451.679 --> 1456.0
my background which is

1452.96 --> 1459.2
literally the same

1456.0 --> 1462.0
for over a year every day

1459.2 --> 1462.0
what's the point

1471.44 --> 1477.919
oh nice that's good to hear uh

1474.48 --> 1477.919
stopping traffic in my restaurant

1478.0 --> 1483.039
that's very cool that's very cool that

1480.64 --> 1487.8400000000001
that enough people got together to uh

1483.039 --> 1487.84
to make a stand like that

1493.84 --> 1499.6
uh now akumu virus

1497.2 --> 1500.799
look when i talk about passion i'm not

1499.6 --> 1503.84
talking about

1500.799 --> 1506.559
the average passion i was

1503.84 --> 1508.32
specifically contrasting it with like

1506.559 --> 1511.039
the more zen

1508.32 --> 1512.32
thing because my passion like i said

1511.039 --> 1515.84
overflowing it's

1512.32 --> 1517.84
it's too much for me

1515.84 --> 1520.72
like i'm over sensitive to my own

1517.84 --> 1520.72
feelings in a way

1521.2 --> 1527.76
and that's just how i'm like and

1525.12 --> 1529.279
i've just can reflect back on that that

1527.76 --> 1530.559
is kind of what my mother was like as

1529.279 --> 1533.919
well

1530.559 --> 1537.2
so i probably just inherited that

1533.919 --> 1540.3200000000002
and yeah my mother

1537.2 --> 1542.64
huge problems with it huge like

1540.32 --> 1543.52
she couldn't handle herself her own

1542.64 --> 1547.76
identity

1543.52 --> 1550.32
eventually even with that because it

1547.76 --> 1552.4
being like that makes you feel incapable

1550.32 --> 1554.96
it makes you feel

1552.4 --> 1555.8400000000001
like you're unstable all of that even

1554.96 --> 1557.8400000000001
though you're

1555.84 --> 1560.6399999999999
yeah it's not really like that it's just

1557.84 --> 1562.6399999999999
on one little thing

1560.64 --> 1565.44
but it involves in social interactions a

1562.64 --> 1566.24
lot so it's much harder for people like

1565.44 --> 1570.0800000000002
me and my mother

1566.24 --> 1573.279
oh my mother's dead now for a while

1570.08 --> 1576.6399999999999
to handle that to

1573.279 --> 1578.64
find some kind of roots to bypass

1576.64 --> 1580.48
getting all these feelings unleashed on

1578.64 --> 1583.2
you all at the time

1580.48 --> 1584.4
it's tough you know a lot of people can

1583.2 --> 1586.0800000000002
just

1584.4 --> 1587.679
put it to the back of their mind to stay

1586.08 --> 1589.6
focused you know

1587.679 --> 1591.1200000000001
not feel a lot of things that's tough

1589.6 --> 1594.08
for me

1591.12 --> 1594.08
it's very dominant

1594.4 --> 1598.88
i think it can even be traced back to a

1596.64 --> 1602.24
specific type of brain issue

1598.88 --> 1603.279
that's probably inherited it probably

1602.24 --> 1605.76
even has a name

1603.279 --> 1608.559
i i don't think i've ever talked to a

1605.76 --> 1610.0
doctor about that or anything

1608.559 --> 1612.24
maybe that's still gonna happen in the

1610.0 --> 1614.64
future but i saw

1612.24 --> 1615.76
something in my vision concerning it's

1614.64 --> 1617.919
like i've

1615.76 --> 1620.64
had medical inquiries in the dark world

1617.919 --> 1624.72
i can't explain it

1620.64 --> 1626.5590000000002
i was just able to ask like doctors that

1624.72 --> 1628.32
i don't even know how i got there or

1626.559 --> 1630.32
what that was and just ask them like

1628.32 --> 1631.84
what is my condition

1630.32 --> 1634.559
what is this thing and they would

1631.84 --> 1636.0
explain it to me but i can't pinpoint

1634.559 --> 1638.84
that

1636.0 --> 1641.84
to any point in time so it's very

1638.84 --> 1641.84
surreal

1646.399 --> 1650.6399999999999
but yeah i don't know why it is the way

1649.44 --> 1654.88
it is with me

1650.64 --> 1657.44
and if it could be

1654.88 --> 1659.6000000000001
improved upon i've been able to improve

1657.44 --> 1662.3990000000001
upon a lot of my skills that seem

1659.6 --> 1665.84
completely dead and lacking

1662.399 --> 1670.399
half of my life so maybe i can still

1665.84 --> 1670.399
manage to keep it growing and fix that

1673.039 --> 1677.44
right so sorry just blabbering on about

1680.84 --> 1687.76
myself

1683.36 --> 1687.76
unemployed anarchists god

1688.0 --> 1690.799
it's terrible

1693.52 --> 1699.76
it's like antifa is really terrible

1696.64 --> 1702.64
i know because

1699.76 --> 1704.08
i almost used to be one until i kind of

1702.64 --> 1706.24
figured out what it was

1704.08 --> 1707.6
that made no freaking sense literally

1706.24 --> 1708.88
all these people just don't know what

1707.6 --> 1712.0
the [ __ ] they're doing

1708.88 --> 1712.7990000000002
like even if you just ask them in a

1712.0 --> 1715.84
harmless way

1712.799 --> 1717.36
as a buddy as somebody at least feels

1715.84 --> 1719.12
like you're on the same side like

1717.36 --> 1720.4799999999998
they don't know what the [ __ ] they're

1719.12 --> 1723.6
doing man

1720.48 --> 1727.2
literally these people are just

1723.6 --> 1730.0
lost as i said they they've give up

1727.2 --> 1732.0
they're too embarrassed by their

1730.0 --> 1735.84
conscious realization that they

1732.0 --> 1737.52
are that they have no grip on anything

1735.84 --> 1739.36
yet they have all these feelings though

1737.52 --> 1741.6
discord and [ __ ]

1739.36 --> 1743.4399999999998
they can't handle it so they just try to

1741.6 --> 1746.48
ignore everything and just follow

1743.44 --> 1747.919
a basic cheap program that seems to give

1746.48 --> 1750.0
some prospects

1747.919 --> 1752.72
disregarding all the consequences

1750.0 --> 1755.6
everything just putting it all aside

1752.72 --> 1755.6000000000001
that's antifa

1757.36 --> 1761.52
these people just they're lost

1763.919 --> 1767.8400000000001
they don't know what to do with

1765.039 --> 1767.84
themselves

1786.88 --> 1791.8400000000001
they have tons of local family so zero

1792.84 --> 1797.4399999999998
what

1795.12 --> 1797.4399999999998
right

1806.84 --> 1809.84
what

1833.76 --> 1837.84
i what are you guys talking about

1862.96 --> 1869.76
what if i was going to keep an image

1866.559 --> 1872.08
of a deadly weapon as my backdrop

1869.76 --> 1874.08
i would be hoping i'm sending some kind

1872.08 --> 1879.84
of message

1874.08 --> 1879.84
uh well

1880.08 --> 1887.76
my message is hey i'm an elf

1884.64 --> 1887.76
elves have bows

1888.32 --> 1894.8799999999999
and i can use it

1892.0 --> 1897.6
i have something like i am not

1894.88 --> 1899.8400000000001
defenseless that's basically the message

1897.6 --> 1901.039
and i've made it very clear to the world

1899.84 --> 1904.84
like yeah

1901.039 --> 1906.399
i'm super tolerant until you push me too

1904.84 --> 1909.039
far

1906.399 --> 1910.8799999999999
and then you may get a problem and then

1909.039 --> 1914.32
i'll get a problem as well but

1910.88 --> 1917.279
it that's what's gonna happen

1914.32 --> 1917.279
and that's the message

1918.24 --> 1924.64
and i'm not planning on doing anything

1921.36 --> 1927.76
that's gonna hurt anyone but

1924.64 --> 1930.5590000000002
if people yeah if i'm literally like

1927.76 --> 1931.12
people are gonna try to just noticeably

1930.559 --> 1934.24
put

1931.12 --> 1935.84
shackles on me just like that and think

1934.24 --> 1938.3990000000001
they can get away with it

1935.84 --> 1938.399
think again

1939.279 --> 1945.679
i'm not falling for any trap

1942.96 --> 1947.519
that i can see coming at least and i

1945.679 --> 1950.48
think i can see a lot coming

1947.519 --> 1950.48
too much sometimes

1951.279 --> 1956.48
but yeah that doesn't mean that you

1954.72 --> 1963.84
can't just force it on me i

1956.48 --> 1963.84
as well it's just not gonna work

1964.96 --> 1967.8400000000001
hey adam akin

1974.72 --> 1978.0
hard left cold

1982.399 --> 1987.6789999999999
i i don't know what that means razda

1984.96 --> 1987.679
when i read it

1987.76 --> 1997.679
the vagos outlaw motorcycle club

1993.12 --> 2001.039
so they're like rich people

1997.679 --> 2004.3990000000001
in a motorcycle club that are antifa

2001.039 --> 2006.8799999999999
is that it that sounds

2004.399 --> 2006.8799999999999

what the hell this

2017.12 --> 2021.12
is conversation is about

2023.12 --> 2026.6399999999999
i think rasta was trying to share the

2025.76 --> 2030.08
people

2026.64 --> 2031.76
that stood up right so it's like the

2030.08 --> 2035.36
motor

2031.76 --> 2039.279
cycle club guys were part of that

2035.36 --> 2041.519
and yeah that was enough to repel any uh

2039.279 --> 2047.84
antifa protesters from coming that is

2041.519 --> 2047.84
that it

2069.929 --> 2073.099
[Music]

i remember that when you came when that

2154.24 --> 2160.4799999999996

2272.24 --> 2276.7999999999997
i even have like a a d fort

2277.28 --> 2280.2400000000002
like in the woods

2280.48 --> 2285.839
call it fort irwin it's right next to a

2283.28 --> 2285.8390000000004
river

2286.72 --> 2290.64
see maybe i can find the drawing

2296.8 --> 2301.04
i haven't used it in a long long time

2301.92 --> 2306.7200000000003
because yeah that was way in the

2304.24 --> 2311.4399999999996
beginning

2306.72 --> 2312.0699999999997
well where is it it's fine

2311.44 --> 2313.4900000000002
there it is

2312.07 --> 2316.56
[Applause]

2313.49 --> 2316.56
[Music]

2316.64 --> 2321.92
it's like the second thing the second

2319.04 --> 2321.92
thing i even drew

2322.21 --> 2327.52
[Music]

2324.48 --> 2331.44
right so this would be

2327.52 --> 2334.64
fort arwin i guess in the woods

2331.44 --> 2337.92
top down oh yeah and

2334.64 --> 2337.92
first person view

2338.2 --> 2342.24
[Applause]

2339.599 --> 2342.2400000000002
interior

2345.359 --> 2347.7599999999998
anyway

2352.96 --> 2360.0
oh man yeah i think i might be

2357.359 --> 2361.359
playing d and d again somewhere soon i'm

2360.0 --> 2369.839
really looking forward to it

2361.359 --> 2369.839
it's been way too long

2371.359 --> 2376.3199999999997
are we new please that's terrible

2376.72 --> 2383.839
and i'm not gonna rename the channel

2379.68 --> 2383.839
fort harwin

2386.96 --> 2389.839
it is funny though

2392.24 --> 2395.2799999999997
it is hard to find a good guy master i

2394.24 --> 2398.72
know i

2395.28 --> 2403.52
am one of them and i'm yeah

2398.72 --> 2403.52
very rare i don't do a lot of games

2404.8 --> 2409.52
because in my game it's not just the

2407.599 --> 2412.079
game it's not just the technicals

2409.52 --> 2414.4
there is like a story and a future and a

2412.079 --> 2415.04
past and history that has to be conjured

2414.4 --> 2417.2000000000003
up

2415.04 --> 2419.359
i've basically basically simulating an

2417.2 --> 2423.04
entire world with a spirit

2419.359 --> 2426.88
even spirit of that world so it's like

2423.04 --> 2427.44
infused enough for people to really

2426.88 --> 2430.8
catch

2427.44 --> 2430.8
on with the vision

2431.119 --> 2434.88
and that's that's tough to do for a game

2433.119 --> 2435.76
master you know a lot of game masters

2434.88 --> 2438.4
out there

2435.76 --> 2439.599
they're like oh i'm just very much

2438.4 --> 2442.2400000000002
everybody wants me

2439.599 --> 2444.1600000000003
everybody wants a game master so dude

2442.24 --> 2453.839
why are you calling me our winner dude

2444.16 --> 2453.839
that's really annoying

2454.96 --> 2457.28
right

2459.04 --> 2462.48
but yeah most game masters they just do

2461.44 --> 2464.56
a lot of games

2462.48 --> 2466.88
a lot a lot like a lot if they can if

2464.56 --> 2468.7999999999997
they have the time but then yeah

2466.88 --> 2472.0
you play some different type of games

2468.8 --> 2475.04
simultaneously it's going to be messy

2472.0 --> 2477.52
or it's beco going to become a soup

2475.04 --> 2480.48
the story and the feel it's like

2477.52 --> 2482.72
people's personal journeys within

2480.48 --> 2484.72
within their character is not going to

2482.72 --> 2487.1189999999997
be remembered as much

2484.72 --> 2489.52
that's the consequence of when you game

2487.119 --> 2493.76
master too many things at the same time

2489.52 --> 2496.64
so that's why i don't i just do one game

2493.76 --> 2497.76
as a game master and the game can last

2496.64 --> 2501.839
forever

2497.76 --> 2504.8
as long as as the players want it

2501.839 --> 2505.52
and if they quit then i will find new

2504.8 --> 2507.3590000000004
players

2505.52 --> 2509.28
because these this is basically the

2507.359 --> 2513.04
second batch

2509.28 --> 2514.5600000000004
within this game world which came forth

2513.04 --> 2518.16
from a game world that

2514.56 --> 2519.599
i created based on my previous

2518.16 --> 2522.0
set of players that didn't even hang

2519.599 --> 2525.52
around too long and then

2522.0 --> 2528.96
these new players arrived

2525.52 --> 2530.64
in the age before my previous players

2528.96 --> 2534.4
which where everything is much more

2530.64 --> 2536.7999999999997
advanced so i got a whole history line

2534.4 --> 2539.28
ahead of these players that i know and

2536.8 --> 2542.8
that i have to work towards

2539.28 --> 2544.7200000000003
to get a real feel of a history

2542.8 --> 2546.48
and these players don't know it they

2544.72 --> 2549.1189999999997
don't know what happened

2546.48 --> 2551.839
in that other world i didn't tell them i

2549.119 --> 2551.839
still remember

2559.2 --> 2565.839
castle arwen i like fort irwin more

2590.839 --> 2593.839
okey-dokey

2595.52 --> 2600.48
can never describe the surroundings and

2598.079 --> 2601.599
i would drive dungeon masters crazy with

2600.48 --> 2605.119
questions

2601.599 --> 2607.6800000000003
nope no

2605.119 --> 2609.92
that that question need your your head

2607.68 --> 2611.2
will be filled up eventually and if you

2609.92 --> 2614.88
keep pushing it

2611.2 --> 2616.8799999999997
i will literally keep on pushing back

2614.88 --> 2618.2400000000002
until you got so much data that's

2616.88 --> 2618.6400000000003
literally going to hurt your head and

2618.24 --> 2621.1189999999997
you

2618.64 --> 2623.92
literally will stop asking questions

2621.119 --> 2627.44
that's what's going to happen

2623.92 --> 2631.04
because if p if players have like

2627.44 --> 2631.839
pushing things then like reality will

2631.04 --> 2635.119
adapt

2631.839 --> 2635.68
to it there's consequences for what you

2635.119 --> 2649.839
do

2635.68 --> 2649.839
in my game

2653.28 --> 2656.5600000000004
if you are a man you always want to win

2655.599 --> 2659.839
yeah unless you're

2656.56 --> 2662.319
uh unless you don't feel too great

2659.839 --> 2663.44
i had players that are like depressed

2662.319 --> 2665.68
and that were like

2663.44 --> 2667.2000000000003
using their characters as kind of to

2665.68 --> 2669.44
convince

2667.2 --> 2672.0
virtual suicide basically they were like

2669.44 --> 2674.64
no no i'll be an evil character

2672.0 --> 2675.92
like okay that's gonna create problems

2674.64 --> 2679.92
yeah i know like

2675.92 --> 2683.04
uh right and they were like

2679.92 --> 2686.56
happy about it weird people

2683.04 --> 2687.68
yeah that player is not like with the

2686.56 --> 2691.04
group anymore

2687.68 --> 2693.1189999999997
his hands like really weird social

2691.04 --> 2697.359
justice word condition issues

2693.119 --> 2697.359
serious anyway

2698.8 --> 2704.88
yeah but yeah you can

2702.88 --> 2706.6400000000003
do with the character whatever you like

2704.88 --> 2710.1600000000003
one of my players that's still going on

2706.64 --> 2713.44
has like a character that is

2710.16 --> 2716.0789999999997
which he prides himself like

2713.44 --> 2716.88
is grappled it's weird it's like this

2716.079 --> 2719.52
character that's

2716.88 --> 2721.44
[ __ ] up psychologically and personally

2719.52 --> 2724.64
socially like

2721.44 --> 2728.48
but can still

2724.64 --> 2728.48
is still like effective and

2728.72 --> 2735.2799999999997
yeah like he finds it interesting to

2731.76 --> 2737.8390000000004
to dabble with somebody who's constantly

2735.28 --> 2739.52
balancing with handling responsibility

2737.839 --> 2740.4
right but when they do they can really

2739.52 --> 2743.2
crush it

2740.4 --> 2744.88
and so you see it's a character's

2743.2 --> 2746.64
journey and it's really up to the

2744.88 --> 2748.6400000000003
players how much they understand what

2746.64 --> 2750.16
the game really is what that story of

2748.64 --> 2752.0
their character really is

2750.16 --> 2754.3999999999996
what they want to do with it you can

2752.0 --> 2756.079
play a tragic character you can play a

2754.4 --> 2759.04
champion character you can play an

2756.079 --> 2761.6800000000003
impossible odds character somebody that

2759.04 --> 2763.2
you demand is going to be faced with

2761.68 --> 2764.0789999999997
tough situations and then the game

2763.2 --> 2767.839
master can

2764.079 --> 2770.8
abide to that can adapt

2767.839 --> 2771.2799999999997
the story setting to that if necessary

2770.8 --> 2773.3590000000004
and

2771.28 --> 2774.8
by the way players can also drive their

2773.359 --> 2778.16
choices towards such

2774.8 --> 2782.1600000000003
things so yeah

2778.16 --> 2786.0
game mastering dnd doing it right it

2782.16 --> 2790.64
has a lot of unique qualities

2786.0 --> 2790.64
you need a unique experience qualities

2791.359 --> 2795.519
if you do it right

2792.42 --> 2795.5190000000002
[Music]

2796.88 --> 2800.2400000000002
the amber chronicles never heard of that

2799.28 --> 2803.2000000000003
but then again

2800.24 --> 2817.839
i don't read books but i've also never

2803.2 --> 2817.839
heard of it

2828.839 --> 2831.839
oh

2831.92 --> 2836.88
what ice wall can we

2835.04 --> 2845.839
establish an ice wall first and then

2836.88 --> 2845.839
we'll see

2878.64 --> 2881.68
the description of the realm is what

2880.48 --> 2884.8
brings a wonder

2881.68 --> 2887.359
the wonder of imagination right but

2884.8 --> 2888.96
it's all about the experience approach

2887.359 --> 2890.48
for the game master

2888.96 --> 2892.48
i don't like to call it dungeon master

2890.48 --> 2895.92
by the way so

2892.48 --> 2896.2400000000002
because if you just start out reading

2895.92 --> 2900.4
out

2896.24 --> 2903.52
a story roughly describing the place

2900.4 --> 2906.559
that doesn't really do anything my

2903.52 --> 2910.319
personal experience is that i

2906.559 --> 2915.44
want the characters to literally

2910.319 --> 2918.72
learn about the world as the characters

2915.44 --> 2920.96
so the players can ask like

2918.72 --> 2921.7599999999998
do i remember like what happened in my

2920.96 --> 2925.119
past

2921.76 --> 2926.559
and then it'll be made and then what do

2925.119 --> 2929.839
i remember about this

2926.559 --> 2929.8390000000004
and then it will be said

2930.319 --> 2934.319
and that will have an influence on the

2932.559 --> 2936.48
entire histories it's it's like

2934.319 --> 2937.92
the players literally write the part of

2936.48 --> 2941.359
the history i

2937.92 --> 2942.16
flexibly write the parts surrounding

2941.359 --> 2944.0
that and

2942.16 --> 2945.359
determine the consequences of the

2944.0 --> 2948.64
alteration

2945.359 --> 2949.119
so it's like an entire 4d map of how

2948.64 --> 2952.24
things

2949.119 --> 2954.88
happen that's yeah that i

2952.24 --> 2956.3999999999996
alone really am wielding although other

2954.88 --> 2960.559
players do

2956.4 --> 2962.88
figure it out what the spirit is

2960.559 --> 2965.0400000000004
like the methods of how i do they

2962.88 --> 2967.2000000000003
understand how i work as a gamer they

2965.04 --> 2969.2
they understand that spirit part it's

2967.2 --> 2970.96
they're good gamers they're sharp they

2969.2 --> 2972.8799999999997
know how i work and they even try to

2970.96 --> 2976.319
trick me sometimes

2972.88 --> 2979.2000000000003
i guess i i do yeah

2976.319 --> 2979.2
like the challenge

2981.52 --> 2988.88
but it's all about

2985.2 --> 2991.2799999999997
players going traveling to new lands

2988.88 --> 2992.48
not knowing what to expect that there's

2991.28 --> 2994.6400000000003
nothing better

2992.48 --> 2995.76
there's nothing better than for gay

2994.64 --> 2999.68
master to just

2995.76 --> 3001.92
not say it not show that part ever

2999.68 --> 3003.7599999999998
keep it ahead of time like the players

3001.92 --> 3006.4
might go to this land

3003.76 --> 3007.2000000000003
make sure they never get to see that map

3006.4 --> 3009.6800000000003
ever

3007.2 --> 3010.8799999999997
make sure they don't know it or they

3009.68 --> 3014.24
only have like an

3010.88 --> 3015.119
ancient rough line of like there's a

3014.24 --> 3018.0
continent not

3015.119 --> 3019.92
nobody knows what's on it something and

3018.0 --> 3022.72
then keep that there in there

3019.92 --> 3023.2000000000003
don't tell them what you got planned

3022.72 --> 3026.16
because

3023.2 --> 3027.9199999999996
that is that's what draws them that's

3026.16 --> 3030.16
what draws the adventurous feeling in

3027.92 --> 3032.88
there

3030.16 --> 3033.44
it's how i did the frost lauren campaign

3032.88 --> 3035.839
part

3033.44 --> 3038.4
of us of this adventure it's they

3035.839 --> 3040.7999999999997
basically went on a giant ice cap

3038.4 --> 3041.92
and and nobody or barely anybody ever

3040.8 --> 3044.079
went there and they had

3041.92 --> 3047.92
they still haven't reached the final

3044.079 --> 3047.92
places yet still mystery to them

3051.68 --> 3058.0
it's what nasa does irwin

3054.72 --> 3062.319
well yeah storytelling i guess

3058.0 --> 3062.319
they are sort of in their own way

3062.4 --> 3066.319
they do know this the tricks of good

3064.48 --> 3068.72
storytelling

3066.319 --> 3070.4
sometimes wonder why they why they don't

3068.72 --> 3083.839
apply it more often but

3070.4 --> 3083.839
there's probably a good reason

3088.88 --> 3091.119
hmm

3093.839 --> 3100.0789999999997
right but yeah there is nothing more

3097.04 --> 3103.52
alluring than

3100.079 --> 3105.44
a mystery about something and that yeah

3103.52 --> 3107.7599999999998
you could basically tell your characters

3105.44 --> 3109.04
no you you insist on taking all these

3107.76 --> 3111.2000000000003
risks and

3109.04 --> 3112.88
potentially dying to go there and

3111.2 --> 3115.839
adventure which in real

3112.88 --> 3116.2400000000002
in your physical reality it's going to

3115.839 --> 3119.04
be

3116.24 --> 3120.9599999999996
much more you really has to be

3119.04 --> 3123.2
incredibly real and important and it's

3120.96 --> 3126.0
probably going to

3123.2 --> 3127.52
yeah just impact your life in more ways

3126.0 --> 3131.76
than you would like

3127.52 --> 3135.52
and in an adventure in a game you

3131.76 --> 3137.5200000000004
can dispense with all that you can just

3135.52 --> 3139.04
ravel in the adventure just as if you

3137.52 --> 3142.0
were like watching a really good

3139.04 --> 3145.839
adventuring movie

3142.0 --> 3149.44
you can just enjoy that and not

3145.839 --> 3150.4
yeah realize the pain of the strain and

3149.44 --> 3153.76
all that

3150.4 --> 3155.44
and you know

3153.76 --> 3157.44
although yeah i do like to give all

3155.44 --> 3159.04
these things a purpose as well even in

3157.44 --> 3162.48
the story like

3159.04 --> 3165.2
like how do uh

3162.48 --> 3166.64
the characters regard getting wounded

3165.2 --> 3169.1189999999997
how do they regard

3166.64 --> 3170.64
pain like how do they present themselves

3169.119 --> 3172.319
socially in

3170.64 --> 3173.68
things and what kind of culture and

3172.319 --> 3176.72
everything you know

3173.68 --> 3176.72
the dynamics are

3177.52 --> 3195.839
as as wide as you would like as wide as

3180.319 --> 3195.839
you can muster up

3206.64 --> 3210.72
nasa will collapse i don't know

3211.119 --> 3217.359
look if if something like that happened

3214.319 --> 3220.4
it look the thing is it's the

3217.359 --> 3221.44
nasa in a way is like a tool for the

3220.4 --> 3223.359
government for

3221.44 --> 3224.64
the mind control and yeah if that

3223.359 --> 3229.04
collapse that would have

3224.64 --> 3232.7999999999997
drastic consequences so that could

3229.04 --> 3234.88
look in in my prognosis

3232.8 --> 3237.599
if it would happen it would we would all

3234.88 --> 3241.04
have a big problem

3237.599 --> 3244.2400000000002
because then when they when that

3241.04 --> 3245.92
spell is dispelled yeah the controllers

3244.24 --> 3248.0
are not gonna have that spell and what

3245.92 --> 3250.8
are they gonna do then to somehow

3248.0 --> 3251.839
regain control it's probably gonna be

3250.8 --> 3256.559
very drastic

3251.839 --> 3256.5589999999997
measures i

3256.88 --> 3263.76
i prefer not to go there i'd prefer

3260.4 --> 3264.0
a gradual transition if such a thing is

3263.76 --> 3265.8390000000004
even

3264.0 --> 3267.92
possible into a dual cosmogonical

3265.839 --> 3270.4
society which in a way you could

3267.92 --> 3273.119
consider we already kind of are

3270.4 --> 3274.4
because we are flat earthers online we

3273.119 --> 3277.04
are

3274.4 --> 3279.2000000000003
yeah we're not getting arrested [ __ ]

3277.04 --> 3280.24
like that you know unless you're just an

3279.2 --> 3284.0
idiot

3280.24 --> 3286.0
make creating that yourself but

3284.0 --> 3287.76
we're allowed to be here to converse to

3286.0 --> 3289.839
have activity and yeah we have

3287.76 --> 3290.559
downplayed a lot and we're ridiculed a

3289.839 --> 3294.24
lot

3290.559 --> 3294.2400000000002
but we are here

3295.76 --> 3301.44
we are developing and we're growing in

3298.96 --> 3301.44
numbers

3302.48 --> 3306.48
and yeah some people like to see it as a

3305.44 --> 3308.96
war

3306.48 --> 3311.119
and then like revenge for all the lies

3308.96 --> 3314.0
well

3311.119 --> 3315.44
i'd like to not go there because i see

3314.0 --> 3321.839
that that would

3315.44 --> 3321.839
end result in a very bad situation

3324.319 --> 3327.52
but yeah i

3328.079 --> 3335.8390000000004
i don't know for sure though

3339.76 --> 3344.2400000000002
it yeah it's just only one way to find

3342.88 --> 3346.1600000000003
out

3344.24 --> 3348.4799999999996
that's just to see what happens and hope

3346.16 --> 3353.92
that flat earthers won't be

3348.48 --> 3353.92
become to to obsess

3354.16 --> 3363.839
like in a in a vengeful way

3357.44 --> 3363.839
that would be a problem

3383.73 --> 3390.77
[Music]

3386.16 --> 3393.8089999999997
i don't know good servant

3390.77 --> 3393.809
[Music]

3395.76 --> 3405.8390000000004
like what does that even mean anymore

3411.52 --> 3415.44
really never been this week

3415.76 --> 3419.8390000000004
in what sense

3447.839 --> 3451.92
i don't get it good servant why are you

3449.359 --> 3451.92
saying that

3453.599 --> 3456.6400000000003
listening to the words coming out of

3455.359 --> 3461.839
your mouth

3456.64 --> 3461.839
why are you saying all that

3468.64 --> 3477.52
fake fires and mobs economic tension and

3474.799 --> 3478.88
does that determine the weakness of the

3477.52 --> 3481.2
country

3478.88 --> 3484.1600000000003
like that yeah so that's why i asked

3481.2 --> 3489.5989999999997
could you be more specific

3484.16 --> 3491.68
china got back to work right supposedly

3489.599 --> 3494.079
but that's not the end of it though you

3491.68 --> 3496.319
know what's the geopolitical situation

3494.079 --> 3499.52
what's the trade situation just because

3496.319 --> 3502.16
countries go back to work it's not the

3499.52 --> 3504.96
end of it

3502.16 --> 3507.04
i think that a lot of trades like

3504.96 --> 3509.52
international trade situations are still

3507.04 --> 3512.5589999999997
pretty much halted and even blockaded

3509.52 --> 3516.0
here and there so

3512.559 --> 3518.079
what does that mean and like

3516.0 --> 3520.96
what does that have to do with war in

3518.079 --> 3520.96
america soon

3521.119 --> 3526.079
i don't get it you're just throwing all

3524.16 --> 3529.52
these words in a giant

3526.079 --> 3545.8390000000004
soup bowl and stirring it

3529.52 --> 3545.839
to what end

3551.119 --> 3554.96
all right all right there's certainly a

3553.839 --> 3557.599
lot of

3554.96 --> 3559.839
tumult tumultuous times indeed missouri

3557.599 --> 3559.839
bear

3560.4 --> 3566.799
but some does that make america weak

3563.44 --> 3568.0
you know yeah it may look in a way you

3566.799 --> 3570.48
could say oh there's not

3568.0 --> 3572.88
a lot of order it's not a lot of unity

3570.48 --> 3578.16
is that specifically

3572.88 --> 3578.1600000000003
the only thing that matters i don't know

3578.88 --> 3585.6800000000003
like does the condition of what's

3582.24 --> 3589.2799999999997
on the ground even really affect

3585.68 --> 3591.44
the control of

3589.28 --> 3592.6400000000003
the united states as a geopolitical

3591.44 --> 3600.079
power

3592.64 --> 3602.72
it's a question no

3600.079 --> 3602.7200000000003
i'm not sure

3604.4 --> 3611.359
but yeah economic halts and all that

3608.079 --> 3613.44
it's an issue if productions get

3611.359 --> 3615.839
completely stopped that that is kind of

3613.44 --> 3615.839
an issue

3617.119 --> 3620.4
but i think that just the

3620.72 --> 3627.359
the the trade cut off

3624.0 --> 3630.48
and like the the trade lines the stream

3627.359 --> 3632.5589999999997
of trade that halting and being

3630.48 --> 3635.119
blockaded here i think that is a much

3632.559 --> 3636.559
bigger problem on the long run and not

3635.119 --> 3639.599
just for the united

3636.559 --> 3643.8390000000004
for united states no every

3639.599 --> 3643.839
freaking country in the world

3797.92 --> 3800.96
i don't know anymore

3801.52 --> 3805.119
my entire conception of what the world

3803.599 --> 3809.039
is what humanity is

3805.119 --> 3812.48
just been overturned so many times

3809.039 --> 3815.119
that i'm just starting to retract

3812.48 --> 3815.119
on even

3815.68 --> 3819.52
trying to figure it out anymore i just

3818.799 --> 3822.319
know that i

3819.52 --> 3825.839
have care for nature in many ways and

3822.319 --> 3825.839
that that's kind of my focus

3828.4 --> 3832.88
because when it concerns human beings

3830.88 --> 3837.52
it's just

3832.88 --> 3840.079
the the the oppositional nature

3837.52 --> 3843.28
rejection is nature that just comes with

3840.079 --> 3843.28
so many people it's just

3843.68 --> 3847.2
i don't really know what to do then

3851.28 --> 3856.2400000000002
like yeah you can play with it you can

3853.44 --> 3859.92
even manipulate it but

3856.24 --> 3859.9199999999996
it it feels

3860.24 --> 3865.0389999999998
like a problem that's gonna grow worse

3863.119 --> 3869.839
and it's not gonna

3865.039 --> 3869.8390000000004
grow less over time

3870.24 --> 3875.5989999999997
just the amount of people that are

3873.44 --> 3877.52
especially on the internet active and

3875.599 --> 3878.48
just wasting everybody's time and

3877.52 --> 3880.079
trolling

3878.48 --> 3882.64
the amount of people doing that is

3880.079 --> 3884.559
increasing over time

3882.64 --> 3886.0789999999997
now at the same time there's also more

3884.559 --> 3889.119
people wisening up

3886.079 --> 3892.1600000000003
in between that and learning

3889.119 --> 3893.119
rapidly more than they probably would

3892.16 --> 3896.16
have

3893.119 --> 3897.599
if they didn't have any internet but

3896.16 --> 3900.96
still it's like

3897.599 --> 3903.92
it's just a an exponential effect it

3900.96 --> 3903.92
just keeps going

3904.319 --> 3911.599
i don't know i can't envision some kind

3909.039 --> 3914.6400000000003
of balance in that

3911.599 --> 3916.48
like what do you do to people that are

3914.64 --> 3919.44
just

3916.48 --> 3920.48
just being trolls and like how do they

3919.44 --> 3922.2400000000002
get there and

3920.48 --> 3924.16
like if they're like that then it's very

3922.24 --> 3926.64
likely that they don't have a lot of

3924.16 --> 3928.0789999999997
people caring for them

3926.64 --> 3929.839
because who would want to care for

3928.079 --> 3932.2400000000002
somebody that just doesn't give a [ __ ]

3929.839 --> 3932.24
like that

3933.52 --> 3939.68
or like people doing that in secret just

3937.2 --> 3941.839
trying to act like they're the great

3939.68 --> 3944.799
person and they're all very nice

3941.839 --> 3946.48
never really revealing who they are and

3944.799 --> 3950.799
then secretly just being

3946.48 --> 3953.599
absolute nasty bastards on the internet

3950.799 --> 3955.599
mostly who knows how far that goes

3953.599 --> 3958.7200000000003
sometimes

3955.599 --> 3965.839
i don't know what to do about that it

3958.72 --> 3965.839
aggravates me

3980.29 --> 3983.54
[Music]

3988.319 --> 3991.359
right fifa tote

3991.44 --> 3999.039
phoebe tod

3995.28 --> 4001.92
yeah it is really tough

3999.039 --> 4002.4
and you could call it sad you could also

4001.92 --> 4005.839
call it

4002.4 --> 4008.319
neutral it's like

4005.839 --> 4009.359
and then besides the neutral there is

4008.319 --> 4011.0389999999998
something good

4009.359 --> 4014.48
and there's something bad and it

4011.039 --> 4018.079
balances out even though

4014.48 --> 4022.079
it's never really the same again

4018.079 --> 4025.2000000000003
it's like a form of entropy

4022.079 --> 4025.2000000000003
development wise

4025.599 --> 4031.52
and the problem is is that

4029.359 --> 4033.7599999999998
when the development has not happened

4031.52 --> 4036.4
yet

4033.76 --> 4038.3190000000004
in a visceral way it cannot really be

4036.4 --> 4040.7200000000003
understood yet

4038.319 --> 4041.68
and that's why it develops to be

4040.72 --> 4045.2
understood

4041.68 --> 4047.0389999999998
afterward so as it is now going as this

4045.2 --> 4050.72
troll plague

4047.039 --> 4050.7200000000003
it's just growing worse and worse

4051.599 --> 4054.7200000000003
i don't understand where it's gonna go

4053.68 --> 4058.16
eventually i

4054.72 --> 4059.4399999999996
can only have cheap imaginations that

4058.16 --> 4062.0789999999997
don't feel like they're

4059.44 --> 4063.039
solid that that yeah that's not gonna

4062.079 --> 4066.559
happen

4063.039 --> 4069.92
and i don't know but it it's gonna go

4066.559 --> 4069.92
somewhere in some way

4071.92 --> 4080.48
like what would shift these people

4076.88 --> 4082.319
from that position of just

4080.48 --> 4084.079
wasting everybody's time giving up just

4082.319 --> 4085.2799999999997
getting in people's way so they don't

4084.079 --> 4091.8390000000004
feel bad

4085.28 --> 4091.8390000000004
how you do do you shift from that

4098.799 --> 4103.5199999999995
in a way i'm i'm even in way kind of

4101.679 --> 4107.1990000000005
desperate about my own past

4103.52 --> 4107.679
at it because i was like that in a way

4107.199 --> 4111.3589999999995
too

4107.679 --> 4115.359
it just had strong almost yeah naive

4111.359 --> 4119.1990000000005
and but just like like no i refuse to

4115.359 --> 4123.52
accept the world is like that

4119.199 --> 4126.639999999999
and like really like aggressively fool

4123.52 --> 4130.56
myself with that like being

4126.64 --> 4132.96
proud of it and you can't break it

4130.56 --> 4135.359
you can't you can't break it it can only

4132.96 --> 4137.52
just happen to you

4135.359 --> 4139.359
you you you got to feel it and then

4137.52 --> 4143.6
decide to change it

4139.359 --> 4144.4800000000005
but i can only reflect upon how that

4143.6 --> 4146.56
happened to me

4144.48 --> 4147.919999999999
and how i was very stubborn and fell

4146.56 --> 4152.4800000000005
back constantly as

4147.92 --> 4156.4
just mind switch just like what what

4152.48 --> 4159.678999999999
and i got out of it

4156.4 --> 4161.44
but yet i see tons of people out there

4159.679 --> 4162.719
and i'm not seeing them getting out of

4161.44 --> 4166.4
it or they're

4162.719 --> 4170.0
getting worse they're not doing that

4166.4 --> 4173.2789999999995
and i like it was so tough for me

4170.0 --> 4176.0
it's so tough just living knowing

4173.279 --> 4176.64
that somebody with my intellectual

4176.0 --> 4180.799
sharpness

4176.64 --> 4183.52
my skill actually was that weak

4180.799 --> 4183.5199999999995
it's like a

4184.319 --> 4189.839000000001
a very very painful scar from the past

4191.279 --> 4198.320000000001
and it's it is healing but it's just

4194.64 --> 4201.04
invisible and it's really

4198.32 --> 4202.159
painful and i'm constantly reminded

4201.04 --> 4204.0
about it more and more

4202.159 --> 4206.159
which is probably a sign that it is

4204.0 --> 4208.4
actually in a healing process

4206.159 --> 4208.4
you know

4209.44 --> 4213.5199999999995
and it is important that i realize it

4211.36 --> 4213.5199999999995
like

4213.679 --> 4217.76
i would prefer to go around in life as a

4216.239 --> 4220.959999999999
symbol of

4217.76 --> 4220.96
almost like yeah that's

4221.199 --> 4231.599999999999
that's what that is and this is how you

4223.6 --> 4233.76
get out

4231.6 --> 4236.8
but yeah you can't make people get out

4233.76 --> 4239.52
of it and i don't know

4236.8 --> 4240.719
why people sometimes get out of it and

4239.52 --> 4243.120000000001
why some people

4240.719 --> 4244.32
don't and let it aggravate their entire

4243.12 --> 4247.28
life

4244.32 --> 4247.28
and why people

4247.679 --> 4254.96
yeah i

4250.96 --> 4254.96
yeah i just don't get it

4256.84 --> 4263.4400000000005
anyway but yeah luckily there's still

4260.0 --> 4265.679
enough people that that don't do it

4263.44 --> 4266.96
or that have briefly done that and then

4265.679 --> 4270.0
figured it out quick

4266.96 --> 4272.719
quickly people that had great

4270.0 --> 4273.84
support like in your weak moments have

4272.719 --> 4276.4
strong people

4273.84 --> 4278.08
in your vicinity that actually can see

4276.4 --> 4280.5599999999995
you and your spirit

4278.08 --> 4282.0
can save so many things you know most

4280.56 --> 4285.04
damage that i underwent

4282.0 --> 4286.88
is because it was in a period where

4285.04 --> 4288.4
everything broke apart where my parents

4286.88 --> 4291.76
got separated

4288.4 --> 4294.0
where my mother got sick or i didn't

4291.76 --> 4297.360000000001
know what to freaking do with my life

4294.0 --> 4299.36
when i got out of school it was so

4297.36 --> 4301.04
bad in so many ways i felt so ashamed

4299.36 --> 4301.92
towards my family there was nobody for

4301.04 --> 4305.44
me just

4301.92 --> 4308.64
to to basically

4305.44 --> 4310.719
where i felt safe to yeah

4308.64 --> 4311.84
like i couldn't trust what i was going

4310.719 --> 4315.44
through with them

4311.84 --> 4318.56
and that

4315.44 --> 4320.32
was that lack of people just being

4318.56 --> 4323.280000000001
strong with me

4320.32 --> 4323.28
and i stumble

4323.92 --> 4327.52
it's like the worst combination of

4325.84 --> 4330.0
factors and i just

4327.52 --> 4331.76
i like got really depressed effectively

4330.0 --> 4335.28
like really like i don't know

4331.76 --> 4338.719
like i felt like i if this keeps up i'm

4335.28 --> 4338.719
gonna be dead in five years

4339.12 --> 4344.48
that's what it felt like in a way like

4342.32 --> 4345.599999999999
really like almost like you have this

4344.48 --> 4347.5199999999995
clock ticking

4345.6 --> 4349.04
you feel like there's a timer and when

4347.52 --> 4352.320000000001
it's out it's like

4349.04 --> 4357.84
somehow it's all gonna go to hell it's

4352.32 --> 4357.84
very bad feeling

4358.48 --> 4371.839999999999
accompanied by some really freaky dreams

4372.159 --> 4379.5199999999995
yeah but at least i didn't double down

4375.84 --> 4380.64
on the bad mistakes like the only thing

4379.52 --> 4382.8
i kind of did

4380.64 --> 4384.56
double down on up until a certain point

4382.8 --> 4386.4800000000005
is that i just didn't want to lose my

4384.56 --> 4389.120000000001
friends that i knew

4386.48 --> 4390.959999999999
were stuck in these bad decisions that

4389.12 --> 4394.159
were

4390.96 --> 4397.36
insane marxist sympathizers

4394.159 --> 4399.679
that were doubling downing atheists

4397.36 --> 4402.239
that would get nasty if you would test

4399.679 --> 4402.2390000000005
them on that

4403.04 --> 4407.04
because i i just couldn't bear the idea

4406.4 --> 4410.0
of being

4407.04 --> 4410.0
even more alone

4411.12 --> 4414.8
and that's the mistake that i held on to

4413.84 --> 4418.08
the longest

4414.8 --> 4419.52
in the whole [ __ ] period

4418.08 --> 4422.48
that i just hung around with friends

4419.52 --> 4422.4800000000005
that weren't good for me

4424.8 --> 4428.159000000001
and that i literally overlooked moments

4427.679 --> 4433.52
where

4428.159 --> 4433.5199999999995
they were manipulating me in plain sight

4435.199 --> 4438.4
and that i cocked to that because i

4437.84 --> 4440.96
didn't

4438.4 --> 4442.32
want to lose my friends because i felt

4440.96 --> 4446.159
so alone

4442.32 --> 4446.159
that's a [ __ ] up situation i guess

4448.56 --> 4453.04
but when you feel you just can't afford

4450.88 --> 4455.84
being even more alone you just don't

4453.04 --> 4455.84
you do whatever

4462.0 --> 4465.76
all right but anyways sorry to drag you

4464.48 --> 4469.04
guys down in

4465.76 --> 4472.400000000001
a pretty depressed period in my life

4469.04 --> 4474.239
probably many ways but it is

4472.4 --> 4478.08
yeah this is what a lot of people are

4474.239 --> 4480.32
going through as well in their own way

4478.08 --> 4481.92
and there's a whole group of people out

4480.32 --> 4482.239
there that are kind of counting on that

4481.92 --> 4484.56
there

4482.239 --> 4487.44
there's they seek out individuals in

4484.56 --> 4491.92
vulnerable moments and try to crack them

4487.44 --> 4495.199
try to break them and they're out there

4491.92 --> 4496.08
so yeah if you have a family if you have

4495.199 --> 4499.12
kids

4496.08 --> 4502.4
and you [ __ ] up and you break morale

4499.12 --> 4503.84
and you and you you let go the

4502.4 --> 4507.28
responsibility that you

4503.84 --> 4509.12
must uphold even if it would cost your

4507.28 --> 4512.0
life

4509.12 --> 4512.8
like as a father or whatever you know

4512.0 --> 4516.32
then

4512.8 --> 4517.52
yeah the the kids are basically going to

4516.32 --> 4520.799999999999
be taken away

4517.52 --> 4524.080000000001
maybe they'll be there with you in that

4520.8 --> 4527.6
house or whatever spiritually

4524.08 --> 4529.12
they will be taken away you don't know

4527.6 --> 4533.04
what's going to happen with them

4529.12 --> 4534.8
because you did that because you

4533.04 --> 4538.719
dropped the responsibility sorry i'm

4534.8 --> 4541.04
being really

4538.719 --> 4541.04
hard

4550.8 --> 4567.84
is anybody still out there hello

4554.08 --> 4567.84
hello hello

4570.0 --> 4574.4
ah thank you kamikaze gilmore i do my

4578.84 --> 4581.84
best

4585.199 --> 4587.5199999999995
hmm

4588.32 --> 4599.36
you're crying wow it's okay man

4595.12 --> 4603.199
sorry damn you i don't know what

4599.36 --> 4604.719
a good servant like i don't say this

4603.199 --> 4606.839999999999
i think he really needs our prayers

4604.719 --> 4611.28
because it's just you're so tense

4606.84 --> 4614.2390000000005
man you got

4611.28 --> 4617.599999999999
dark stuff on your mind so much like i

4614.239 --> 4617.599999999999
wish you could somehow just

4618.239 --> 4624.239
let that go in some ways i think it

4621.04 --> 4624.239
would be better for you like

4625.36 --> 4628.639999999999
you just seem really tense

4634.159 --> 4638.5599999999995
you feel peace and joy yeah but earlier

4636.8 --> 4640.08
this hangout you said you just couldn't

4638.56 --> 4644.080000000001
wait until the rapture

4640.08 --> 4651.84
that's not a good sign that means you

4644.08 --> 4651.84
are under tension you can't deny that

4655.6 --> 4658.96
why would you constantly have the end on

4658.0 --> 4661.84
your mind

4658.96 --> 4665.84
that's not a good thing you gotta

4661.84 --> 4665.84
realize this

4672.239 --> 4680.718999999999
yes so so what if it is a better place

4677.36 --> 4684.32
why don't you just come here

4680.719 --> 4684.32
to do what you were gonna do

4686.719 --> 4692.4
if all you're gonna do is just stare

4689.76 --> 4694.64
at the next stop then what are you doing

4692.4 --> 4694.639999999999
here

4697.84 --> 4702.400000000001
aren't you here to to live and to figure

4701.6 --> 4704.320000000001
things out and

4702.4 --> 4706.08
figure yourself out and to deal with

4704.32 --> 4711.759999999999
your struggles and

4706.08 --> 4711.76
overcome what may seem as impossible

4712.159 --> 4721.839999999999
not by rushing it but by figuring it out

4744.88 --> 4749.1990000000005
you feel you're there to give god a

4747.36 --> 4751.04
report on the conditions ah that's a

4749.199 --> 4754.08
that's a good one missouri bear look

4751.04 --> 4756.32
in a way everybody that is open to god

4754.08 --> 4759.199
and the truth and the realizations

4756.32 --> 4759.599999999999
that that oh so important realizations

4759.199 --> 4761.879999999999
that's

4759.6 --> 4763.679
really what it's about it's the

4761.88 --> 4767.36
realization

4763.679 --> 4769.84
of the truth not just an idea

4767.36 --> 4771.12
somewhat to aim for it's the realization

4769.84 --> 4777.84
and that is the real

4771.12 --> 4777.84
structure of it right

4778.64 --> 4782.8
that's where we basically do report to

4781.6 --> 4786.400000000001
god that's where we

4782.8 --> 4790.56
are with god

4786.4 --> 4793.839999999999
and yeah as being in that frequency you

4790.56 --> 4794.64
are connected you report god sees all

4793.84 --> 4798.56
especially

4794.64 --> 4800.56
through the eyes that carry him

4798.56 --> 4802.8
that's how it feels to be sometimes

4800.56 --> 4807.120000000001
sometimes it feels like i

4802.8 --> 4809.6
am almost like yeah a representative

4807.12 --> 4811.199
it gets like a priest i don't want to

4809.6 --> 4812.639
claim any authority here

4811.199 --> 4814.4
even spiritually everybody is

4812.639 --> 4815.6
responsible for their own spiritual

4814.4 --> 4817.44
well-being

4815.6 --> 4818.719
and their kids very important in your

4817.44 --> 4821.839999999999
family

4818.719 --> 4823.679
right but it feels sometimes like

4821.84 --> 4825.84
like i become an avatar and i'm just

4823.679 --> 4825.84
like

4827.679 --> 4835.679
just saying it as it is and just like

4830.96 --> 4838.88
conveying this judgment

4835.679 --> 4841.6
and i i don't even want to be

4838.88 --> 4842.400000000001
my ego has nothing to do with it it's

4841.6 --> 4845.6
like

4842.4 --> 4846.719
no this is not about you are we this is

4845.6 --> 4850.96
about

4846.719 --> 4851.36
what it is and when that happens i feel

4850.96 --> 4853.84
like

4851.36 --> 4854.639
yeah like i become like an avatar almost

4853.84 --> 4858.4800000000005
it's it's

4854.639 --> 4860.159000000001
incredible sensation and i take it very

4858.48 --> 4862.879999999999
seriously to keep that pure

4860.159 --> 4863.92
to not let my eo get a grip on that at

4862.88 --> 4867.1990000000005
all ever

4863.92 --> 4871.1990000000005
never ever can never touch it

4867.199 --> 4874.44
it's not his and when it is then i get

4871.199 --> 4875.919999999999
yeah then i'll step away from the

4874.44 --> 4879.36
responsibility

4875.92 --> 4881.6
of judgment not try to pretend judgment

4879.36 --> 4884.5599999999995
in my moment of ego and i'll just show

4881.6 --> 4886.159000000001
my discontent

4884.56 --> 4889.120000000001
and that's how i deal with that i will

4886.159 --> 4891.199
never use the refined judgment tool for

4889.12 --> 4893.92
my ego

4891.199 --> 4898.049999999999
to let it control somebody or to

4893.92 --> 4899.92
maneuver myself in an indecent way

4898.05 --> 4904.320000000001
[Music]

4899.92 --> 4905.76
and it's very hard to resist that by the

4904.32 --> 4910.0
way for a lot of people

4905.76 --> 4913.76
it's like understandable like everybody

4910.0 --> 4917.04
has intelligence is seduced by this

4913.76 --> 4918.96
it's no exception it's it's like right

4917.04 --> 4921.12
there in front of you to pick up it it

4918.96 --> 4924.719
can be that seducing

4921.12 --> 4928.8
just let your skills let your ego

4924.719 --> 4931.52
get that grip and then do something

4928.8 --> 4932.639
that's not just the pure skill of what

4931.52 --> 4936.080000000001
the pure logos

4932.639 --> 4939.92
it's so seductive to so many people

4936.08 --> 4941.36
and i learned to let never do that

4939.92 --> 4942.96
very early on it's like one of the

4941.36 --> 4944.799999999999
things actually that my parents were

4942.96 --> 4948.4
kind of punishing with

4944.8 --> 4952.159000000001
on me and that

4948.4 --> 4959.839999999999
really got through to me i guess

4952.159 --> 4959.839999999999
very very young very very young

4961.04 --> 4964.48
and i'm really glad of it

4963.06 --> 4967.120000000001
[Music]

4964.48 --> 4968.5599999999995
because the ego you know when you when

4967.12 --> 4970.8
you let your ego just

4968.56 --> 4973.320000000001
take control of your skills just like

4970.8 --> 4976.159000000001
that in the moment because of some

4973.32 --> 4978.0
dissatisfaction or

4976.159 --> 4980.239
or you just don't like that guy for no

4978.0 --> 4983.76
good reason or something you know

4980.239 --> 4985.759999999999
it's bad it's bad when that happens

4983.76 --> 4987.12
it's bad when your skills are used for

4985.76 --> 4990.320000000001
your

4987.12 --> 4990.32
ego satisfaction

4992.159 --> 4998.5599999999995
unless it has a place you know

4995.679 --> 5000.8
everybody especially in relations the

4998.56 --> 5002.8
ego must have a place in some way it

5000.8 --> 5006.08
must there must be a balance with it

5002.8 --> 5008.400000000001
there is an ego in social relations and

5006.08 --> 5012.84
especially love relations it's there

5008.4 --> 5015.759999999999
it must have a place but it

5012.84 --> 5017.04
still there must be a careful balance

5015.76 --> 5021.4400000000005
found in this and

5017.04 --> 5023.6
yeah the difference per person

5021.44 --> 5025.199
that's too complicated i can't i can't

5023.6 --> 5029.84
give you a general description for that

5025.199 --> 5029.839999999999
i hope you guys get my point

5042.08 --> 5047.92
you grieve for the world and other

5044.719 --> 5051.92
people but you feel joy that

5047.92 --> 5051.92
that seems like a contradiction there

5052.239 --> 5060.159
grief and joy don't mix

5056.8 --> 5071.84
literally that's not a possible state

5060.159 --> 5071.839999999999
it's a conflicting chemistry

5073.28 --> 5075.84
all right

5078.4 --> 5085.28
anyway just know that i'm keeping an eye

5080.239 --> 5088.638999999999
on you good servant not saying you're

5085.28 --> 5091.679
you're out of control but i know you do

5088.639 --> 5091.679
worry me sometimes

5094.239 --> 5097.28
but then again i think that that's

5095.92 --> 5098.8
probably

5097.28 --> 5103.12
other people have the same feeling

5098.8 --> 5103.12
towards me it can be very

5103.92 --> 5110.56
all over the place emotional wise well

5107.199 --> 5115.599999999999
not that much which is what i

5110.56 --> 5115.6
dabble in for a bowl wise and all that

5117.36 --> 5119.679
right

5124.48 --> 5127.5199999999995
for how long do you think you will be

5126.48 --> 5131.5199999999995
doing this show

5127.52 --> 5134.320000000001
uh well i usually do a one and a half

5131.52 --> 5135.84
hour show on saturday

5134.32 --> 5141.84
sometimes two hours when i'm

5135.84 --> 5141.84
particularly inspired

5143.28 --> 5155.84
i don't know we'll see where it goes

5156.32 --> 5162.159
all right 30 more minutes maybe

5164.239 --> 5170.638999999999
at least five more minutes oh yeah by

5167.6 --> 5170.639
the way there was a uh

5171.04 --> 5182.4
a stream before mine

5174.96 --> 5184.719
from rodrigo ferrara ferrari nunes

5182.4 --> 5187.759999999999
it was a pretty good show or three hours

5184.719 --> 5187.76
ago by the way it says

5190.0 --> 5197.84
it's like i was surprised there weren't

5191.92 --> 5197.84
more live viewers

5208.84 --> 5211.84
right

5222.239 --> 5228.32
does he do a regular show uh

5225.84 --> 5231.360000000001
i don't know i'll i'll you know just

5228.32 --> 5231.36
check out his channel

5232.0 --> 5239.36
i i haven't really kept track of him and

5235.679 --> 5242.08
it's just recently i was paid

5239.36 --> 5243.199
i noticed that he had like a show going

5242.08 --> 5253.84
on his own

5243.199 --> 5253.839999999999
uh yeah i just seem to stream regularly

5259.6 --> 5262.719
he does all kinds of things i think he's

5262.239 --> 5267.04
into

5262.719 --> 5271.52
chess as well

5267.04 --> 5271.5199999999995
anyway yeah i'll link uh his channel

5274.159 --> 5278.48
but i think he's a really interesting

5276.08 --> 5278.48
person

5278.719 --> 5285.12
it does seem to have like a very

5282.639 --> 5287.12
he's very sensible it's very careful

5285.12 --> 5290.32
senses very careful

5287.12 --> 5291.28
but not like overly feely he's just very

5290.32 --> 5295.28
careful and sharp

5291.28 --> 5297.36
i like it

5295.28 --> 5299.12
does he talk about a lots of topics then

5297.36 --> 5303.12
yeah sure lots of topics

5299.12 --> 5308.4
nasa a lot and always into chess

5303.12 --> 5311.44
and all kinds of things

5308.4 --> 5316.5599999999995
he did his last video

5311.44 --> 5316.5599999999995
was it again was about this

5318.48 --> 5325.839999999999
there's a yeah grimes this pop

5322.639 --> 5329.679
girl situation going on i think it's

5325.84 --> 5334.0
creepy as [ __ ] that that person

5329.679 --> 5334.0
it's like and yeah he talked about that

5334.639 --> 5341.4400000000005
do i play chess well not particularly

5338.08 --> 5344.239
no i they have played chess

5341.44 --> 5344.48
i'm not really in a chess enthusiast but

5344.239 --> 5347.599999999999
i

5344.48 --> 5348.4
i do think it's a pretty good game of

5347.6 --> 5351.6
course

5348.4 --> 5354.08
of course not yeah

5351.6 --> 5365.84
i would play chess you know but i'm not

5354.08 --> 5365.84
a real expert

5371.199 --> 5375.199
a bit like my channel you never stay on

5373.12 --> 5379.28
one topic

5375.199 --> 5381.678999999999
well maybe he is not doing a daily show

5379.28 --> 5384.719
format thing he's just

5381.679 --> 5387.28
streaming on the go has presentation

5384.719 --> 5389.36
yeah he basically does live

5387.28 --> 5392.08
presentations

5389.36 --> 5393.36
he's probably more technically app than

5392.08 --> 5397.28
myself

5393.36 --> 5399.759999999999
these presentations do look pretty good

5397.28 --> 5401.12
but yeah i just have a daily show and

5399.76 --> 5403.4400000000005
it's me talking so

5401.12 --> 5404.48
i am of course i'm going to be all over

5403.44 --> 5406.4
the place

5404.48 --> 5408.4
because i basically have to keep on

5406.4 --> 5410.96
going every day

5408.4 --> 5412.48
and make sure that i keep it interesting

5410.96 --> 5413.84
make sure that i keep on learning and

5412.48 --> 5415.599999999999
that

5413.84 --> 5418.84
yeah that will lead to something to

5415.6 --> 5420.96
something useful some inspiration some

5418.84 --> 5426.08
idea

5420.96 --> 5426.08
or yeah the passing on of information

5430.719 --> 5437.76
and yeah rodrigo does more just

5435.44 --> 5438.879999999999
uh what is it i guess it's more like the

5437.76 --> 5442.159000000001
flatter talks

5438.88 --> 5444.88
theme based system as my previous show

5442.159 --> 5449.839999999999
just show about a subject and then he

5444.88 --> 5449.84
kind of sticks to that subject

5456.0 --> 5463.84
much harder to talk without fits in your

5458.159 --> 5463.839999999999
video yeah

5466.639 --> 5472.4800000000005
well in general i also try to avoid

5469.84 --> 5474.2390000000005
playing videos because of copyright

5472.48 --> 5477.12
issues and i want to keep that

5474.239 --> 5478.879999999999
clean record so i don't link to stuff

5477.12 --> 5481.599999999999
i'll describe it

5478.88 --> 5482.0
but i prefer not to play things on my

5481.6 --> 5484.639
show

5482.0 --> 5485.52
because i just don't want to get in

5484.639 --> 5490.2390000000005
trouble there

5485.52 --> 5492.400000000001
i want to keep it easy for myself

5490.239 --> 5493.678999999999
unless of course somebody gets on my

5492.4 --> 5496.159
show

5493.679 --> 5497.92
or asks me to specifically play some

5496.159 --> 5499.759999999999
video they made then of course i'll do

5497.92 --> 5505.84
it

5499.76 --> 5505.84
if i if i appreciate the video content

5508.8 --> 5515.28
do i like some other board games then

5513.28 --> 5516.639
not particularly i have played board

5515.28 --> 5519.599999999999
games but

5516.639 --> 5522.400000000001
if even designed board games as a kid

5519.6 --> 5522.400000000001
did that a lot

5522.56 --> 5526.400000000001
nothing special by the way but just

5526.719 --> 5530.4800000000005
but yeah these days no not so much into

5529.12 --> 5533.04
board games although yeah you could

5530.48 --> 5538.239
consider the combat aspect of d d

5533.04 --> 5538.239
a bit like a board game and yeah

5540.239 --> 5547.839999999999
it does use boards and grids

5554.8 --> 5558.719
oh yeah by the way i should definitely

5557.04 --> 5561.84
after yesterday

5558.719 --> 5566.0
link to formerly known

5561.84 --> 5566.0
free energies channel who's now
