good to see you

so yeah roger

131.12 --> 135.12
uh yeah contact me on skype as i asked

133.28 --> 136.48
him and he informed me about the

135.12 --> 139.68
situation of us

136.48 --> 144.23899999999998
what was actually going on

139.68 --> 148.72
concerning the cabinet fall yesterday

144.239 --> 148.72
what exactly happened and

148.959 --> 153.84
it would it was something yeah i didn't

151.92 --> 157.11999999999998
expect it to be about this but

153.84 --> 158.64000000000001
yeah it's the netherlands so apparently

157.12 --> 162.16
there was this

158.64 --> 162.879
uh some kind of tax situation that

162.16 --> 165.44
directly

162.879 --> 167.35999999999999
involved actions of like the prime

165.44 --> 171.599
minister and everything

167.36 --> 175.12
and it's been like the bad situation had

171.599 --> 175.11999999999998
been grinding on for a while

175.2 --> 180.64
and now that is kind of the the excuse

178.8 --> 184.48000000000002
you would almost say

180.64 --> 188.07999999999998
uh yeah

184.48 --> 192.56
for them to step down now i guess

188.08 --> 195.36
uh anyway that's a very short version

192.56 --> 197.68
uh but it has to do with some tax

195.36 --> 200.4
situation anyway

197.68 --> 202.15900000000002
and yeah not corona measures or anything

200.4 --> 204.08
i had kind of hoped it would be about

202.159 --> 207.67999999999998
that but it wasn't

204.08 --> 213.28
this is all right hey

207.68 --> 215.519
terra 306 good to see you

213.28 --> 215.519
uh

218.0 --> 224.64
right yeah roger if you want

222.08 --> 226.799
again i can call you up on skype it's

224.64 --> 230.879

226.799 --> 233.12
if you are up for that i can skype call

230.879 --> 233.12
you

233.84 --> 241.84

238.0 --> 241.84
reflect to you in chat

242.48 --> 247.51899999999998
all right yeah i didn't make a lot of

245.599 --> 249.83999999999997
notes yesterday i shouldn't do that more

247.519 --> 249.84
often

250.159 --> 254.239
but i didn't watch a whole lot of

253.04 --> 256.959
streams out there i

254.239 --> 259.199
just ended up watching cartoons it was

256.959 --> 262.4
weird

259.199 --> 262.40000000000003
how did that even happen

262.8 --> 266.16
right yeah i watched it i was watching

265.52 --> 270.0
old

266.16 --> 272.32000000000005
gi joe cartoons that's been a long long

270.0 --> 275.919
time since i saw those and

272.32 --> 275.919
it's just funny to see it again

276.8 --> 281.199
and like it's so messy the series is

280.16 --> 284.56
very messy

281.199 --> 285.68
and nonsensical in just endless amounts

284.56 --> 287.6
of ways

285.68 --> 289.759
but it's kind of kind of funny to see it

287.6 --> 291.759
all back

289.759 --> 294.0
so i kept stuck watching that for a

291.759 --> 297.84000000000003
while until like my brain got all

294.0 --> 297.84
mushy from it

299.919 --> 305.12
right flat earth debate was pretty good

302.96 --> 307.68
yesterday

305.12 --> 309.28000000000003
i was very active this time in the sense

307.68 --> 311.12
that i stuck around until

309.28 --> 312.96
the end until everybody left and then

311.12 --> 315.28000000000003
went for groceries

312.96 --> 316.71999999999997
usually i go for groceries somewhere in

315.28 --> 319.75899999999996
the middle of it

316.72 --> 319.759
but not this time

319.919 --> 324.77
stuck around uh

324.16 --> 327.839
let's see

324.77 --> 327.839
[Music]

330.0 --> 343.46
hey rob h good to see you

338.72 --> 345.44000000000005

i'll call you up then and it's also

347.44 --> 350.479
going to be me figuring out if

348.88 --> 351.52
everything's going to work properly

350.479 --> 354.88
though

351.52 --> 357.19899999999996
because i already had some mic problems

354.88 --> 359.6
it's even a miracle i managed to start

357.199 --> 362.319
up in time

359.6 --> 363.759
because like the sound has shifted again

362.319 --> 367.84000000000003
in obs

363.759 --> 367.84000000000003
so i hope

372.8 --> 378.0
skype is gonna work out sound wise

376.319 --> 380.8
so let's check it out hope there's not

378.0 --> 395.84
gonna be a lot of echoes and all that

502.4 --> 506.71999999999997
man

503.28 --> 509.67999999999995
yeah thanks for coming on sure

506.72 --> 512.4
and being my dutch informant in this

509.68 --> 512.4
scenario

512.479 --> 520.0
right so yeah the situation yesterday

517.279 --> 521.279
uh were you expecting it to happen i

520.0 --> 522.479
don't know if you've been following

521.279 --> 524.64
dutch news

522.479 --> 528.72
i i personally don't really follow it a

524.64 --> 531.279
lot just look at it from a distance

528.72 --> 532.32
yeah i was kind of expecting it um there

531.279 --> 535.8389999999999
were talks about

532.32 --> 537.839
them stepping down for a couple of weeks

535.839 --> 541.6
now because there was this

537.839 --> 545.6800000000001
commission that did a report about the

541.6 --> 549.279
fraud that was done by our tax

545.68 --> 551.4399999999999
institutions so i was expecting them to

549.279 --> 555.04
step down because it was

551.44 --> 558.08
uh yeah the the situation wasn't

555.04 --> 561.1999999999999
um good enough

558.08 --> 563.76
for them to to stay right

561.2 --> 566.0
good enough for them to stay can what do

563.76 --> 569.6
you mean

566.0 --> 572.88
well there was um to elaborate

569.6 --> 576.08
um it all started when

572.88 --> 579.6
uh it's about welfare

576.08 --> 582.8000000000001
and people get welfare uh

579.6 --> 584.64
for children right so if you have

582.8 --> 586.16
a lot of children you have you get some

584.64 --> 588.8389999999999
welfare for this

586.16 --> 590.0
so the whole problem started when

588.839 --> 592.24
immigrants

590.0 --> 594.0
were right sorry it's called child

592.24 --> 595.92
support in english yeah

594.0 --> 597.44
right it's normal by the way that that

595.92 --> 599.36
that's normal most countries

597.44 --> 601.12
it's not specifically socialism it's

599.36 --> 602.0790000000001
normal to do that in russia they have

601.12 --> 605.839
that too you know

602.079 --> 608.3199999999999
they're not socialist at all so

605.839 --> 609.839
so it started when people were being

608.32 --> 613.7600000000001
fraudulent with these

609.839 --> 617.519
um child supports and and

613.76 --> 618.079
welfare money that they got from the

617.519 --> 621.76
government

618.079 --> 625.3599999999999
so they wanted to um

621.76 --> 628.959
get rid of the frauds right so they uh

625.36 --> 631.92
were focusing on people that

628.959 --> 634.0
had a immigrant back background name so

631.92 --> 638.7199999999999
that was

634.0 --> 642.48
really a discrimination towards them

638.72 --> 644.5600000000001
then if they couldn't show

642.48 --> 646.5600000000001
for instance one receipt they were

644.56 --> 646.959
labeled as a fraud and then they had to

646.56 --> 650.079
pay

646.959 --> 651.8389999999999
everything back including a fine so

650.079 --> 653.3599999999999
right right yeah they threw the book at

651.839 --> 655.6800000000001
them yeah

653.36 --> 658.24
and selectively so you know if they if

655.68 --> 660.399
they'd done it with everybody i guess

658.24 --> 662.32
then it would have been more fair

660.399 --> 666.8
throwing the book at everyone but

662.32 --> 669.0400000000001
they yeah they picked a specific

666.8 --> 670.0
category i guess and that has caused a

669.04 --> 673.1999999999999
lot of outrage

670.0 --> 676.56
yeah these families got ripped apart

673.2 --> 677.6
they couldn't pay their mortgages

676.56 --> 682.0
anymore

677.6 --> 685.279
um people got divorced

682.0 --> 688.72
i even heard somebody killed himself

685.279 --> 691.6
because of the stress right so um

688.72 --> 692.399
but the whole thing is this was going on

691.6 --> 695.6800000000001
and

692.399 --> 698.48
people uh were um

695.68 --> 699.519
saying this was a bad situation right

698.48 --> 702.24
yeah

699.519 --> 703.519
whistleblowers came out and they kind of

702.24 --> 707.519
muffled them away

703.519 --> 711.92
these whistleblowers and

707.519 --> 711.92
there was a and commission

712.24 --> 715.44
i don't know the exact word but a

713.6 --> 718.8000000000001
commission who didn't

715.44 --> 722.0790000000001
who did a research about it and

718.8 --> 724.0
they came out that it was uh a very bad

722.079 --> 727.279
situation for the people that

724.0 --> 729.76
that concerned it right

727.279 --> 730.8
so yeah the government was responsible

729.76 --> 733.76
for everyone's

730.8 --> 735.76
responsible for this situation so yeah

733.76 --> 737.92
the

735.76 --> 739.12
the most logical step would be to step

737.92 --> 741.519
down because they

739.12 --> 742.16
uh yeah are responsible for the

741.519 --> 745.6
situation

742.16 --> 747.6
and they knew about it so but what i

745.6 --> 748.48
don't understand is that if this is such

747.6 --> 751.12
a big problem

748.48 --> 751.76
especially now like why don't they why

751.12 --> 754.16
didn't they

751.76 --> 757.36
attempt to basically restore it instead

754.16 --> 760.48
of shoving it under the carpet

757.36 --> 760.88
well how uh yeah wait before like how

760.48 --> 763.36
long

760.88 --> 765.68
ago did this happen or did this start to

763.36 --> 765.6800000000001
happen

766.48 --> 770.88
i think it was 2015 something that it

770.079 --> 774.0
started

770.88 --> 777.92
don't quote me on that but the uh the

774.0 --> 781.6
whistleblowers came out at 2017.

777.92 --> 785.519
um all right and yeah so

781.6 --> 788.8000000000001
it's been going on for a while now and

785.519 --> 792.399
after the commission gave its report

788.8 --> 795.4399999999999
the government promised to pay these

792.399 --> 798.56
families 30 000 euros each

795.44 --> 800.0790000000001
and it's now even the situation as far

798.56 --> 803.1999999999999
as i understand that our

800.079 --> 806.16
tax service um one that

803.2 --> 806.8000000000001
wants that money back so it's like they

806.16 --> 810.079
giving it

806.8 --> 813.279
and they immediately want it back to pay

810.079 --> 815.279
pay the debts they have the tax debts

813.279 --> 816.399
right what well that doesn't make any

815.279 --> 818.48
sense that's

816.399 --> 819.519
no really ridiculous why would they do

818.48 --> 821.76
that it's like

819.519 --> 823.6
they're trying to fix a situation and

821.76 --> 827.12
then they're just

823.6 --> 829.76
grabbing it all back that's really dumb

827.12 --> 830.72
yeah it's more they want they don't want

829.76 --> 833.36
to

830.72 --> 835.6800000000001
um how do you say this give give up the

833.36 --> 837.839
the debt right they don't want to

835.68 --> 838.959
um say to the people well you don't have

837.839 --> 841.6800000000001
to pay it no

838.959 --> 842.0
they're doing it uh in a circle way at

841.68 --> 844.4799999999999
this

842.0 --> 845.92
moment they are paying the 30 000 euros

844.48 --> 846.9590000000001
and then they say well now you have to

845.92 --> 850.079
pay your deaths

846.959 --> 852.2399999999999
so give the 30 your 30 000 euros

850.079 --> 853.5999999999999
back again so it's not that they're

852.24 --> 855.199
saying okay

853.6 --> 856.8000000000001
we're not going to look at your tax

855.199 --> 859.92
deaths anymore

856.8 --> 861.3599999999999
um here's your 30 000 euros for

859.92 --> 864.56
compensation right because

861.36 --> 866.9590000000001
people lost houses right but they did

864.56 --> 868.3199999999999
just they basically just sort of

866.959 --> 871.199
nullified

868.32 --> 872.8000000000001
what they what they yeah what they tried

871.199 --> 874.88
to get from them

872.8 --> 876.7199999999999
in the meantime they have all suffered

874.88 --> 878.8
damages because of the situation and

876.72 --> 879.1990000000001
that is not obviously being compensated

878.8 --> 882.3199999999999
for

879.199 --> 884.8
by them taking it back right away right

882.32 --> 886.9590000000001
right so that's that's probably the the

884.8 --> 887.8389999999999
situation then that's really causing all

886.959 --> 890.7199999999999
this

887.839 --> 892.0
well this is after this is just now

890.72 --> 894.32
playing now right so

892.0 --> 895.04
this whole deal with our government uh

894.32 --> 898.639
stepping up

895.04 --> 901.199
was really just

898.639 --> 903.199
meant to happen because this commission

901.199 --> 903.5999999999999
that gave out that report was so damning

903.199 --> 906.8
for

903.6 --> 908.88
the government because it's

906.8 --> 911.199
insinuating that they knew about the

908.88 --> 914.48
situation but didn't act

911.199 --> 915.92
right they just left it hanging making

914.48 --> 917.44
it worse

915.92 --> 919.68
right they should have stepped in and

917.44 --> 922.8000000000001
just quickly fixed it

919.68 --> 925.4399999999999
and yeah and this shows the power of our

922.8 --> 927.12
tax institution right you have the irs

925.44 --> 929.44
in the in the

927.12 --> 930.639
in the us and we have the uh it's called

929.44 --> 933.12
the ballasting deans

930.639 --> 935.279
and it's a text institution and it just

933.12 --> 939.04
shows how much power they have they

935.279 --> 941.519
even go around the government um

939.04 --> 943.5999999999999
the government is is saying well sure

941.519 --> 946.399
you need compensation and then the

943.6 --> 947.1990000000001
the tax institution comes again and say

946.399 --> 948.959
well no

947.199 --> 950.88
that's my money because you have you

948.959 --> 954.3199999999999
have a death right

950.88 --> 957.36
so well yeah that but that's really

954.32 --> 959.759
yeah that's just odd because then

957.36 --> 961.92
the situation is recognized for being

959.759 --> 964.399
bad and asymmetrical

961.92 --> 966.079
and then in a way it's kind of suggested

964.399 --> 966.839
or promised i don't know how far they

966.079 --> 969.7589999999999
went in

966.839 --> 971.519
compensation but it's it's basically

969.759 --> 972.16
just oh we're just gonna pay off the

971.519 --> 974.0
fine that

972.16 --> 975.8389999999999
might have been a little excessive it's

974.0 --> 979.12
not really compensation then

975.839 --> 979.9200000000001
no yeah and and uh if you read the

979.12 --> 984.24
stories

979.92 --> 987.8389999999999
about the families 30 30 000 euros is a

984.24 --> 991.279
is merely a fee people

987.839 --> 993.1990000000001
have have debts for 100 000 euros

991.279 --> 996.24
because they couldn't

993.199 --> 999.199
pay their mortgages again

996.24 --> 999.6
right they got behind on payments um

999.199 --> 1004.3199999999999
yeah

999.6 --> 1004.32
okay sell their houses sheesh

1004.72 --> 1010.9590000000001
yeah that's rough that's rough

1008.32 --> 1012.0
yeah yeah that's basically the the deal

1010.959 --> 1014.88
in a nutshell

1012.0 --> 1015.199
i mean there's more about it i don't

1014.88 --> 1018.639
know

1015.199 --> 1021.92
exactly the whole story but it's it's

1018.639 --> 1024.4
yeah it's a mess so

1021.92 --> 1026.6399999999999
do you also know kind of like what does

1024.4 --> 1029.2800000000002
it practically mean

1026.64 --> 1029.8390000000002
that this cabinet is stepping down

1029.28 --> 1031.6
because

1029.839 --> 1033.039
we talked in the background and said

1031.6 --> 1034.559
that basically

1033.039 --> 1036.24
like everything is going to keep on

1034.559 --> 1039.6
going as it is so they're

1036.24 --> 1042.4
yeah they're leaving it not

1039.6 --> 1044.1599999999999
basically altering things to kind of

1042.4 --> 1046.64
turn back the situation it's more like

1044.16 --> 1048.48
they're just stepping away

1046.64 --> 1050.5590000000002
this brings the whole thing into a new

1048.48 --> 1052.0
light because all the corona policies

1050.559 --> 1053.9189999999999
are still gonna go

1052.0 --> 1055.12
forward with all the nonsense and all

1053.919 --> 1057.2800000000002
the protests

1055.12 --> 1058.559
everything else is still gonna continue

1057.28 --> 1062.16
basically

1058.559 --> 1065.52
yeah um it's called a demacian air

1062.16 --> 1067.919
cabinet right so all the running

1065.52 --> 1069.44
the the the current things that still

1067.919 --> 1072.0
that is still on the table

1069.44 --> 1073.2
can be handled by this cabinet by this

1072.0 --> 1076.32
government

1073.2 --> 1077.28
uh new things cannot be handled uh and

1076.32 --> 1081.76
we having

1077.28 --> 1085.12
we are having a

1081.76 --> 1085.52
would you what's the name um dutch is

1085.12 --> 1088.08
fine

1085.52 --> 1089.44
election election we have an election i

1088.08 --> 1092.84
guess it was the first

1089.44 --> 1095.919
the 14th of march so it's it's

1092.84 --> 1099.36
basically symbolic right because

1095.919 --> 1102.0
um why stepped down

1099.36 --> 1103.12
late in presidential election or wasn't

1102.0 --> 1105.919
it like

1103.12 --> 1106.3999999999999
this right so the karma for kissing so

1105.919 --> 1109.8400000000001
it's

1106.4 --> 1109.8400000000001
choosing a new government

1110.16 --> 1113.76
okay so that was about to come in a few

1113.12 --> 1118.2399999999998
months

1113.76 --> 1120.72
and they stepped down early

1118.24 --> 1122.559
yeah basically it's more symbolic in my

1120.72 --> 1124.799
point of view

1122.559 --> 1126.6399999999999
and they had to because it was really

1124.799 --> 1129.36
it's a real mess with the

1126.64 --> 1130.48
with the tax institution so they had to

1129.36 --> 1132.559
but

1130.48 --> 1134.32
at the other side it's symbolic because

1132.559 --> 1137.44
yeah they only have

1134.32 --> 1139.039
a couple of months left so it's crazy

1137.44 --> 1141.1200000000001
though you know because

1139.039 --> 1142.799
everything you said now i'm not going to

1141.12 --> 1144.559
say you're wrong of course

1142.799 --> 1146.8799999999999
because you're probably much more up to

1144.559 --> 1148.16
date than me but the last time that i

1146.88 --> 1150.72
kind of checked in

1148.16 --> 1151.919
to the situation with the government the

1150.72 --> 1155.1200000000001
tax was actually

1151.919 --> 1157.039
really good like they were bragging a

1155.12 --> 1160.0
couple of years ago about how the

1157.039 --> 1164.24
finances were all adding up and all

1160.0 --> 1167.2
and now not so much anymore i guess

1164.24 --> 1169.52
well this is really about the the

1167.2 --> 1172.799
welfare the people got and

1169.52 --> 1175.2
they got stamped they got framed as

1172.799 --> 1176.8799999999999
a fraudulent body right right our tax

1175.2 --> 1180.16
institution

1176.88 --> 1181.6000000000001
and then whistleblowers came out

1180.16 --> 1183.44
saying well this is a really bad

1181.6 --> 1184.8799999999999
situation because these people didn't do

1183.44 --> 1188.24
anything wrong but

1184.88 --> 1190.88
because they didn't show one receipt

1188.24 --> 1192.88
for instance they immediately got called

1190.88 --> 1196.96
fraudulent and they had to pay

1192.88 --> 1201.0390000000002
everything back including a big fine so

1196.96 --> 1202.799
yeah that it's not about

1201.039 --> 1204.4
you know i just think it's ridiculous

1202.799 --> 1206.1589999999999
like

1204.4 --> 1207.679
it's almost like they're making it an

1206.159 --> 1209.6000000000001
issue of principle

1207.679 --> 1210.96
or separating the powers with the

1209.6 --> 1215.36
taxation system

1210.96 --> 1218.08
sort of because they could just fix it

1215.36 --> 1218.8799999999999
pretty quickly and then yeah okay it

1218.08 --> 1221.76
might cost

1218.88 --> 1222.48
some but i thought financially things

1221.76 --> 1225.2
were going

1222.48 --> 1227.76
really well so shouldn't they just be

1225.2 --> 1230.24
able to fix this quickly and

1227.76 --> 1231.039
not create create a havoc i don't get

1230.24 --> 1233.919
this

1231.039 --> 1235.6
yeah they should should have uh fixed it

1233.919 --> 1237.6000000000001
like immediately because people were

1235.6 --> 1238.32
whistleblowing but they didn't they they

1237.6 --> 1240.7199999999998
wanted to

1238.32 --> 1243.12
keep on going i don't know why it's just

1240.72 --> 1244.24
our authoritarian stubbornness i'd say

1243.12 --> 1247.36
almost

1244.24 --> 1248.48
it could be maybe some legislation that

1247.36 --> 1251.6789999999999
they had to

1248.48 --> 1254.96
follow because yeah

1251.679 --> 1256.0
the the way the our tax institution

1254.96 --> 1258.08
acted wasn't

1256.0 --> 1260.48
wasn't correct so they needed more or

1258.08 --> 1262.8799999999999
less legislations

1260.48 --> 1263.679
but yeah that isn't that easy to do just

1262.88 --> 1267.44
muffle it

1263.679 --> 1270.24
away right no legislation anything to do

1267.44 --> 1271.8400000000001
it should just look if it like throwing

1270.24 --> 1274.96
the book policy at

1271.84 --> 1278.48
receipts missing and all that i don't

1274.96 --> 1281.919
that should not be too hard to just

1278.48 --> 1284.96
tone down you know it's it seems like uh

1281.919 --> 1287.2800000000002
just the attitude approach policy in

1284.96 --> 1289.2
this specific case like okay they

1287.28 --> 1290.72
just were ordered to throw the book at

1289.2 --> 1293.52
it as an example

1290.72 --> 1295.3600000000001
but you don't have to reform the entire

1293.52 --> 1297.84
tax system just to make them

1295.36 --> 1298.9599999999998
take a step back in that policy i don't

1297.84 --> 1302.08
get it

1298.96 --> 1304.24
like it should really be able to be

1302.08 --> 1307.36
fixed very quickly

1304.24 --> 1308.799
in my rough insight you know i'm not a

1307.36 --> 1312.08
politician or a tax

1308.799 --> 1314.48
expert by a long shot but from what i've

1312.08 --> 1315.84
what you've told me i don't understand

1314.48 --> 1318.32
why

1315.84 --> 1319.4399999999998
why they let this get out of control and

1318.32 --> 1322.559
just let it hang

1319.44 --> 1325.6000000000001
for so long i really don't understand

1322.559 --> 1327.28
that's politics for you but it's kind of

1325.6 --> 1329.52
stupid politics

1327.28 --> 1331.52
because it could be fixed it shouldn't

1329.52 --> 1335.28
be too much of a hassle and then

1331.52 --> 1338.32
they wouldn't have a terrible reputation

1335.28 --> 1339.039
so isn't reputation worth anything this

1338.32 --> 1341.76
is

1339.039 --> 1342.799
i thought it meant everything yeah

1341.76 --> 1346.0
you're right but

1342.799 --> 1348.32
so it just it gives me a very odd

1346.0 --> 1350.0
feeling a very odd feeling like there's

1348.32 --> 1352.559
something else going on

1350.0 --> 1353.2
oh conspiracy theory what else is new

1352.559 --> 1357.2
right

1353.2 --> 1359.76
but like it's almost like an excuse

1357.2 --> 1361.6000000000001
to step down early almost like they

1359.76 --> 1365.039
there is more stuff coming and they

1361.6 --> 1366.48
don't want to get the full blow of it

1365.039 --> 1368.799
that's what it gives me the feeling

1366.48 --> 1369.84
because again it it should be easily

1368.799 --> 1372.799
correctable

1369.84 --> 1374.0
and then just move on and no reputation

1372.799 --> 1376.8799999999999
damage but now they

1374.0 --> 1378.48
choose to not do that it's almost like

1376.88 --> 1379.919
they're stepping out of the way to

1378.48 --> 1382.08
prevent

1379.919 --> 1383.039
getting hit by something that's coming

1382.08 --> 1384.72
or

1383.039 --> 1386.64
and they know it's coming and that's why

1384.72 --> 1389.6000000000001
they're doing it instead of

1386.64 --> 1390.159
yeah just being incompetent because

1389.6 --> 1392.799
right

1390.159 --> 1394.96
it's it's very weird it seems weird to

1392.799 --> 1394.96
me

1396.559 --> 1400.48
yeah it's pure speculation but yeah of

1399.2 --> 1404.64
course it's speculation

1400.48 --> 1406.88
it's just that something

1404.64 --> 1408.0800000000002
the situation you know when you it

1406.88 --> 1411.0390000000002
should be fixable

1408.08 --> 1412.48
i don't understand why they're resigning

1411.039 --> 1414.4
over it other than

1412.48 --> 1417.6
they're just looking for an excuse to

1414.4 --> 1421.2
resign you see

1417.6 --> 1424.24
you know the pressure was pretty um

1421.2 --> 1426.96
big for for um from

1424.24 --> 1428.4
like everyone saying them well you need

1426.96 --> 1431.8400000000001
to step down because you

1428.4 --> 1435.919
you knew about it or your

1431.84 --> 1437.1999999999998
the people working below you knew about

1435.919 --> 1440.3200000000002
it about it

1437.2 --> 1444.88
so why didn't you act on it and

1440.32 --> 1447.52
the only way to really um

1444.88 --> 1448.48
say sorry in their eyes is to step down

1447.52 --> 1450.8799999999999
right right yeah

1448.48 --> 1452.24
typical dutch politics and politics in

1450.88 --> 1456.159
general i guess so

1452.24 --> 1456.88
like the the stepping down thing really

1456.159 --> 1459.6000000000001
came from

1456.88 --> 1461.279
inside the government itself almost like

1459.6 --> 1464.3999999999999
a motion of distrust like

1461.279 --> 1465.52
we don't trust you you messed up we we

1464.4 --> 1468.72
don't want you to

1465.52 --> 1473.84
uh represent the opposition and

1468.72 --> 1475.919
yeah all right

1473.84 --> 1478.559
well okay that well that clears that up

1475.919 --> 1480.48
then i guess

1478.559 --> 1481.76
it's still odd though where where's this

1480.48 --> 1484.88
gonna go

1481.76 --> 1488.0
is there what are like the political

1484.88 --> 1490.4
rivals responses to this

1488.0 --> 1491.919
oh they all say well good move right

1490.4 --> 1495.039
this deal said

1491.919 --> 1496.7990000000002
um it's a good move you step down

1495.039 --> 1500.24
because of course we are having

1496.799 --> 1503.44
elections in a few months so

1500.24 --> 1506.96
it fits their needs they can now

1503.44 --> 1508.88
go out and plug their own party

1506.96 --> 1510.559
right so because this is not going to

1508.88 --> 1513.8400000000001
make those main parties

1510.559 --> 1517.279
popular not that they were very popular

1513.84 --> 1519.1999999999998
very contrived situations they've been

1517.279 --> 1522.4
very new world order

1519.2 --> 1522.4
related and all that

1523.279 --> 1527.36
i can easily say um the the parties that

1526.24 --> 1529.279
are now

1527.36 --> 1531.279
involved with this they can easily say

1529.279 --> 1532.799
well yeah the people that were involved

1531.279 --> 1535.36
in this fraudulent

1532.799 --> 1537.039
uh business are now gone so we don't

1535.36 --> 1538.9599999999998
have anything to do with them and we

1537.039 --> 1542.48
want to try and build it better

1538.96 --> 1543.679
right so they could just make up excuses

1542.48 --> 1545.84
so

1543.679 --> 1547.44
and then but is it going to you know

1545.84 --> 1548.24
that that's always the question every

1547.44 --> 1550.48
time

1548.24 --> 1551.44
a political the political reigns are

1550.48 --> 1554.24
handed over to

1551.44 --> 1556.0
some other group are they actually going

1554.24 --> 1558.24
to do something new

1556.0 --> 1559.52
or is it just going to pick up the reins

1558.24 --> 1563.279
and left off

1559.52 --> 1566.6399999999999
with the bigger agenda yeah i think so

1563.279 --> 1570.48
yeah it's just a way to

1566.64 --> 1573.5200000000002
um blame somebody else and then

1570.48 --> 1577.039
uh yeah go go ahead and

1573.52 --> 1577.6
do your thing again right right continue

1577.039 --> 1580.64
on

1577.6 --> 1582.9599999999998
and blame the old ruler

1580.64 --> 1586.159
for all the troubles that is have come

1582.96 --> 1588.799
from just implementing the main agenda

1586.159 --> 1590.24
right and this time we will do it better

1588.799 --> 1593.279
right this time it will oh

1590.24 --> 1596.4
sure be different

1593.279 --> 1599.2
well i'm just curious to see when some

1596.4 --> 1602.48
political group is finally gonna get

1599.2 --> 1604.64
the balls you would say to step up

1602.48 --> 1606.159
against these corona measures for which

1604.64 --> 1608.64
there's so much proof that

1606.159 --> 1610.64
whether you believe it or not the

1608.64 --> 1613.1200000000001
measures are completely ineffective

1610.64 --> 1614.7990000000002
like even medically proven to be

1613.12 --> 1618.0
ineffective

1614.799 --> 1620.48
you know we all know by now that sweden

1618.0 --> 1622.96
that took things completely different

1620.48 --> 1627.1200000000001
didn't have any lock down any

1622.96 --> 1628.88
masks and they're doing just fine

1627.12 --> 1630.3999999999999
they do they have been doing fine and

1628.88 --> 1632.24
they're still doing fine

1630.4 --> 1634.0
and that's just very telling everybody

1632.24 --> 1636.08
kind of knows about that

1634.0 --> 1638.0
so unless you're like really obsessed

1636.08 --> 1638.96
with corona and think the entire world

1638.0 --> 1641.84
is gonna die if

1638.96 --> 1642.72
everybody doesn't wear masks then you're

1641.84 --> 1645.12
going to know like

1642.72 --> 1645.919
this is all just nonsensical it's a

1645.12 --> 1648.9599999999998
waste of time

1645.919 --> 1649.76
it's a waste of money it's bad for

1648.96 --> 1651.279
business

1649.76 --> 1654.32
in the entire netherlands bad for

1651.279 --> 1656.08
industry bad for everything so when is

1654.32 --> 1657.36
is there any outlook that there might be

1656.08 --> 1659.4399999999998
a party

1657.36 --> 1661.9189999999999
that might get a chance to take the

1659.44 --> 1664.559
reins that is going to turn that around

1661.919 --> 1665.3600000000001
is there no outlook for that whatsoever

1664.559 --> 1668.48
yeah

1665.36 --> 1671.9189999999999
there are a few parties like um

1668.48 --> 1674.96
it's called the forum for democracy

1671.919 --> 1679.1200000000001
or uh

1674.96 --> 1681.679
with with head wielders or cherry bardet

1679.12 --> 1682.8799999999999
these are the opposition and of course

1681.679 --> 1685.52
opposition will

1682.88 --> 1686.24
um shout something different than the

1685.52 --> 1689.679
current

1686.24 --> 1692.32
people in in power so it's always

1689.679 --> 1693.52
uh but they're very oppositional and

1692.32 --> 1696.0
they've been so

1693.52 --> 1698.1589999999999
politicized like not even by their own

1696.0 --> 1700.399
doing but just by media

1698.159 --> 1701.679
you know like the party of haird

1700.399 --> 1705.1999999999998
wielders has just been

1701.679 --> 1708.799
endlessly attacked and just made into

1705.2 --> 1711.52
nazis and just literally being censored

1708.799 --> 1712.96
being banned from social media and all

1711.52 --> 1714.48
that's crazy

1712.96 --> 1716.24
right and that's been going for a long

1714.48 --> 1720.0
time even before trump

1716.24 --> 1722.48
came on the scene but yeah they've never

1720.0 --> 1724.08
really been in power so

1722.48 --> 1726.64
if they would get in power what would

1724.08 --> 1728.6399999999999
they actually do you know

1726.64 --> 1729.8400000000001
what would they actually do or is it

1728.64 --> 1733.1200000000001
just they are

1729.84 --> 1735.6
championing that attitude

1733.12 --> 1736.6399999999999
i think mostly that's the case right

1735.6 --> 1739.6789999999999
when

1736.64 --> 1743.279
our last election uh we have

1739.679 --> 1746.72
uh our current well it's not our current

1743.279 --> 1749.84
prime minister anymore but um he

1746.72 --> 1750.96
promised things like we won't give any

1749.84 --> 1753.1999999999998
money to

1750.96 --> 1754.559
greece and stuff like that right right

1753.2 --> 1757.919
right the immigration

1754.559 --> 1758.32
promises that they don't commit to right

1757.919 --> 1760.64
so

1758.32 --> 1762.559
they always do make promises that they

1760.64 --> 1765.76
won't commit to right so

1762.559 --> 1768.32
that's just the game right the game of

1765.76 --> 1768.32
politics

1768.559 --> 1771.6
i guess so but it all still depends

1771.279 --> 1774.96
though

1771.6 --> 1777.1999999999998
if any group is going to be part of that

1774.96 --> 1778.48
bigger system that bigger agenda or if

1777.2 --> 1780.24
they're going to try

1778.48 --> 1783.2
to step out and do something new and

1780.24 --> 1785.679
then create all kinds of

1783.2 --> 1787.039
havoc and corp mega corporations that

1785.679 --> 1789.8400000000001
are suddenly gonna

1787.039 --> 1792.24
work against it because that's something

1789.84 --> 1794.08
that typically happens nowadays

1792.24 --> 1795.919
you know some countries more than others

1794.08 --> 1799.1999999999998
it's just like if

1795.919 --> 1802.72
the politics are like not

1799.2 --> 1805.76
working with the overarching

1802.72 --> 1807.52
party system and the agenda then mega

1805.76 --> 1810.8799999999999
corporations will start to get

1807.52 --> 1814.399
involved themselves and start to

1810.88 --> 1814.72
like yeah say it's all bad it's all bad

1814.399 --> 1818.08
they

1814.72 --> 1819.919
are evil they're the new they are nazis

1818.08 --> 1822.72
and they're going to ruin everything and

1819.919 --> 1824.5590000000002
then they create a hassle

1822.72 --> 1827.3600000000001
now in america of course this has

1824.559 --> 1830.96
happened like nowhere else with trump

1827.36 --> 1834.399
they really over killed that process

1830.96 --> 1836.32
but yet every country in my opinion that

1834.399 --> 1838.399
is going to have some kind of a cabinet

1836.32 --> 1840.399
or a president that is going to try to

1838.399 --> 1842.2399999999998
go against

1840.399 --> 1844.0
yeah the new world order agenda the

1842.24 --> 1848.0
globalism agenda

1844.0 --> 1852.0
with mass migration open border policy

1848.0 --> 1854.72
and uh climate change nonsense

1852.0 --> 1855.679
like as soon as you go against that not

1854.72 --> 1858.08
work along with it

1855.679 --> 1860.0800000000002
mega corporations are going to basically

1858.08 --> 1863.279
assault you through media

1860.08 --> 1864.0
as a government yeah yeah that's usually

1863.279 --> 1866.0
the case yeah

1864.0 --> 1868.559
right so then it becomes the question

1866.0 --> 1869.2
are if they are going to try something

1868.559 --> 1871.84
like that

1869.2 --> 1873.679
will they be able to handle it do they

1871.84 --> 1875.279
know what's coming

1873.679 --> 1876.72
do they have a plan for that are there

1875.279 --> 1879.919
people out there that can

1876.72 --> 1882.0
actually way up to mega corporate

1879.919 --> 1884.24
influence

1882.0 --> 1887.919
or is it already too late are we already

1884.24 --> 1887.919
in a neo-feudal society

1888.32 --> 1894.24
i would say so i would say that

1891.6 --> 1895.6789999999999
usually the mega corporations and

1894.24 --> 1897.679
central banks

1895.679 --> 1899.1200000000001
do have the most power i mean the

1897.679 --> 1901.919
illusion is created that

1899.12 --> 1902.32
we the people as a democracy can vote

1901.919 --> 1904.88
and

1902.32 --> 1906.32
say well we want this policy and we want

1904.88 --> 1909.3600000000001
that policy but that

1906.32 --> 1912.1589999999999
isn't the case anymore i mean

1909.36 --> 1913.1999999999998
in every election um there are ma there

1912.159 --> 1916.24
are promises made

1913.2 --> 1921.2
and those are broken constantly

1916.24 --> 1925.279
so um yeah it's for me personally

1921.2 --> 1929.1200000000001
uh it's just two sides of the same coin

1925.279 --> 1929.679
um for instance we have a multi-party

1929.12 --> 1931.279
system

1929.679 --> 1933.76
in the netherlands right so you don't

1931.279 --> 1935.2
have the same as the us where you have

1933.76 --> 1937.919
republicans

1935.2 --> 1938.799
and democrats now we have multi multiple

1937.919 --> 1940.72
parties and

1938.799 --> 1942.32
people can vote on these multiple

1940.72 --> 1945.2
parties so when

1942.32 --> 1945.519
when the government needs to be formed

1945.2 --> 1948.32
they

1945.519 --> 1949.1200000000001
need to they they make coalitions right

1948.32 --> 1952.1589999999999
so

1949.12 --> 1954.1589999999999
uh the biggest party will make a

1952.159 --> 1956.0
coalition with another party and then

1954.159 --> 1959.279
maybe a smaller party and they

1956.0 --> 1962.88
will right uh make concessions

1959.279 --> 1963.84
so if uh if a party is if there is a

1962.88 --> 1965.679
party which

1963.84 --> 1966.9599999999998
which they want to make a coalition with

1965.679 --> 1970.24
and they have

1966.96 --> 1970.64
for instance anti-corona measurement in

1970.24 --> 1973.76
their

1970.64 --> 1977.919
in their uh program then it could be

1973.76 --> 1980.559
that they need to drop those um

1977.919 --> 1982.5590000000002
those things that they want to do in the

1980.559 --> 1984.799
in the in the next few years

1982.559 --> 1985.6
because they want to participate in the

1984.799 --> 1989.36
current

1985.6 --> 1991.1999999999998
government so it's it's it's basically

1989.36 --> 1994.8799999999999
the same thing it's just like in

1991.2 --> 1997.44
america us there is the right hand

1994.88 --> 1998.96
and the left hand in the netherlands

1997.44 --> 2001.6000000000001
there's also in my opinion

1998.96 --> 2003.679
right hand and left hand except we just

2001.6 --> 2005.279
get to see a lot of fingers

2003.679 --> 2007.919
guess what those fingers are gonna get

2005.279 --> 2011.2
stuck to two hands

2007.919 --> 2011.6000000000001
so in a way you know it seems like we

2011.2 --> 2014.24
got

2011.6 --> 2016.32
a lot of parties but in the end they

2014.24 --> 2018.72
always come together and basically do

2016.32 --> 2022.1589999999999
the same thing

2018.72 --> 2024.24
right wouldn't you say yeah yeah we have

2022.159 --> 2025.279
and they even like in debates and

2024.24 --> 2028.88
discussions

2025.279 --> 2029.519
form fronts like literally they form

2028.88 --> 2032.24
fronts

2029.519 --> 2034.72
so it becomes a right left hand

2032.24 --> 2037.039
situation

2034.72 --> 2039.039
yeah it just seems like they're split up

2037.039 --> 2041.2
but it seems more like it's every finger

2039.039 --> 2043.6
has their own little talk

2041.2 --> 2046.3990000000001
but when it comes to shove they're just

2043.6 --> 2049.919
part of the hand

2046.399 --> 2053.1189999999997
yeah you're correct right it's yeah

2049.919 --> 2054.879
and it's problematic especially because

2053.119 --> 2056.079
people still fall for it that's the

2054.879 --> 2058.0
problematic part

2056.079 --> 2061.8390000000004
they just fall for the story but they

2058.0 --> 2061.839
don't look at the actual outcome

2062.159 --> 2066.879
yeah yeah for me uh my world view is

2066.159 --> 2070.0
that it is

2066.879 --> 2070.879
all um yeah it's two sides of the same

2070.0 --> 2073.119
coin it's

2070.879 --> 2074.0
doesn't really matter i mean i wouldn't

2073.119 --> 2076.32
imagine it

2074.0 --> 2078.72
being any different if other parties

2076.32 --> 2081.52
were at the wheel at this point

2078.72 --> 2082.399
uh or in the next four four years i mean

2081.52 --> 2085.28
they all

2082.399 --> 2086.3199999999997
uh react on the current situation uh

2085.28 --> 2090.8
mostly ad hoc

2086.32 --> 2093.839
right so they they have this um

2090.8 --> 2095.679
team that decides on what

2093.839 --> 2097.68
is good or what is bad in the current

2095.679 --> 2100.88
situation with with

2097.68 --> 2105.04
the six-foot rules and the masks and the

2100.88 --> 2107.04
what all right so i wouldn't be

2105.04 --> 2108.16
i wouldn't be i wouldn't imagine it

2107.04 --> 2111.44
being any different

2108.16 --> 2115.04
with other parties at the wheel no

2111.44 --> 2117.2000000000003
right yeah oh by the way

2115.04 --> 2118.72
let me address chat for a moment this is

2117.2 --> 2119.52
really good conversation thanks for

2118.72 --> 2122.56
coming on

2119.52 --> 2124.8
uh yeah nathan oakley is in chat who am

2122.56 --> 2128.0
i talking to steamy traveler ask it's

2124.8 --> 2130.8
roger a fellow dutchman

2128.0 --> 2132.88
and i wanted to discuss like the the

2130.8 --> 2134.5600000000004
parliament stepping down yesterday why

2132.88 --> 2138.0
that happened and what is the

2134.56 --> 2140.16
general just for other for outsiders to

2138.0 --> 2142.0
understand like how politics works

2140.16 --> 2144.24
and what the situation is like here in

2142.0 --> 2146.48
the netherlands

2144.24 --> 2148.3999999999996
from our layman's perspective because

2146.48 --> 2151.44
i'm not an expert by a long shot

2148.4 --> 2154.0
and you are probably neither but still

2151.44 --> 2157.68
very informative thanks

2154.0 --> 2160.8
yeah sure right so

2157.68 --> 2163.2
who do you think is or who

2160.8 --> 2165.2000000000003
uh what party do you think is making a

2163.2 --> 2169.04
real chance is it just gonna be

2165.2 --> 2172.56
the same the same core group

2169.04 --> 2175.7599999999998
and just another finger is gonna step up

2172.56 --> 2178.7999999999997
that's very close to the others like

2175.76 --> 2182.1600000000003
that are now stepping down or is it

2178.8 --> 2184.48
is it really like from the other side

2182.16 --> 2186.7999999999997
like what you said uh the form for

2184.48 --> 2188.64
democracy or the ppv

2186.8 --> 2190.079
are they actually going to have a chance

2188.64 --> 2193.1189999999997
this time

2190.079 --> 2196.2400000000002
i don't know the thing is

2193.119 --> 2199.599
i've been seeing this woman being pushed

2196.24 --> 2203.04
lately she's called sigrid kach

2199.599 --> 2206.4
there was a documentary about her um

2203.04 --> 2210.24
i think the biggest socialist party is

2206.4 --> 2212.56
also supporting her and at first i would

2210.24 --> 2216.0
say

2212.56 --> 2218.0
that mr uh the the current minister of

2216.0 --> 2220.16
health would be the next prime minister

2218.0 --> 2220.16
but

2220.4 --> 2226.079
no not him please yeah i

2223.52 --> 2228.0
i mean he has the he has the cards right

2226.079 --> 2231.2000000000003
he could say well i've saved you

2228.0 --> 2231.599
all from god and death right so that's

2231.2 --> 2235.839
his

2231.599 --> 2238.0
his that could be his uh motivation but

2235.839 --> 2241.2799999999997
now i'm thinking do people actually want

2238.0 --> 2242.8
him after all the [ __ ] that has happened

2241.28 --> 2244.32
you know but people believe the

2242.8 --> 2247.44
narrative so he's

2244.32 --> 2250.1600000000003
his it's it's

2247.44 --> 2252.079
the savior right so the current prime

2250.16 --> 2254.0789999999997
minister of health is the savior of the

2252.079 --> 2258.079
netherlands

2254.079 --> 2260.7200000000003
that's the current no but

2258.079 --> 2263.44
at the same time there are businesses

2260.72 --> 2266.64
being ruined and all that

2263.44 --> 2268.64
so but people yeah

2266.64 --> 2269.68
it doesn't matter right they will tell

2268.64 --> 2271.92
you well what

2269.68 --> 2273.52
do you want do you want people to die

2271.92 --> 2276.56
that's

2273.52 --> 2277.52
which people exactly yeah what's the

2276.56 --> 2280.7999999999997
death numbers

2277.52 --> 2282.56
i think that it's pretty damn low

2280.8 --> 2285.28
so there is nothing going on all these

2282.56 --> 2286.96
last times it's all nonsense so

2285.28 --> 2288.96
they don't have any proof that they

2286.96 --> 2292.16
saved anyone

2288.96 --> 2293.359
they just ruined businesses yeah i i

2292.16 --> 2294.64
fully agree but

2293.359 --> 2296.4
yeah and the last time i checked there

2294.64 --> 2300.3199999999997
were like 9 000

2296.4 --> 2303.76
corona deaths in in the netherlands so

2300.32 --> 2307.3590000000004
and those are counted uh in

2303.76 --> 2310.48
two years 2019 2020

2307.359 --> 2312.64
and 21 2021 so

2310.48 --> 2314.64
i would say but this is purely my

2312.64 --> 2318.7999999999997
speculation that they just

2314.64 --> 2322.24
um added two flu seasons

2318.8 --> 2325.6800000000003
with each other so when we look at

2322.24 --> 2328.3999999999996
right current numbers in a flu season

2325.68 --> 2329.5989999999997
the five year average would be every flu

2328.4 --> 2334.32
season would be like

2329.599 --> 2334.32
six thousand deaths so

2334.56 --> 2341.359
okay yeah so yeah but look the

2338.079 --> 2343.2000000000003
people of organizations hospitals are

2341.359 --> 2346.4
screwing with the numbers

2343.2 --> 2349.1189999999997
so a lot of death toll numbers now get

2346.4 --> 2352.56
ascribed to corona this is like

2349.119 --> 2354.88
universally known by now like oh look

2352.56 --> 2356.56
every every other types of deaths are

2354.88 --> 2359.52
just record low

2356.56 --> 2362.48
like the flu is almost entirely gone and

2359.52 --> 2365.839
it's all corona but

2362.48 --> 2366.4
people can't really buy that not really

2365.839 --> 2368.96
right

2366.4 --> 2370.0
they do because the narrative is they

2368.96 --> 2372.64
will tell you

2370.0 --> 2375.2
well flu isn't that contagious and we

2372.64 --> 2377.04
have the rules with the masks and

2375.2 --> 2378.48
so it's the double speak again right

2377.04 --> 2380.0
same with the globe it's the double

2378.48 --> 2382.4
speak so

2380.0 --> 2383.92
the corona can be stopped but the flu

2382.4 --> 2386.7200000000003
can be stopped but the corona

2383.92 --> 2387.44
can't be stopped by all these measures

2386.72 --> 2391.52
so it's

2387.44 --> 2391.52
yeah then why then why do it

2392.0 --> 2396.079
yeah what i thought a measure is against

2394.64 --> 2398.4
something if it's already

2396.079 --> 2399.3590000000004
not helping or proven not to help then

2398.4 --> 2402.4
why

2399.359 --> 2404.16
would you do it yeah that's again for at

2402.4 --> 2409.04
my part speculation but

2404.16 --> 2413.04
i think it's due to the the conditioning

2409.04 --> 2416.24
i call it the white lab coat religion

2413.04 --> 2416.72
believing in the white lab coat and he

2416.24 --> 2419.9199999999996
knows

2416.72 --> 2420.319
what's real and what's uh what's going

2419.92 --> 2423.76
to

2420.319 --> 2425.839
kill you right so right so there's just

2423.76 --> 2428.7200000000003
a lot of weenies here in the netherlands

2425.839 --> 2432.0789999999997
unfortunately sorry a lot of weenies i

2428.72 --> 2432.0789999999997
call them weenies it's just

2432.48 --> 2438.079
easily gullible easy going followers

2436.319 --> 2440.4
and hey the netherlands is filled with

2438.079 --> 2442.88
that sort of people not all of them

2440.4 --> 2444.7200000000003
but there is a lot of that going around

2442.88 --> 2447.52
just people that'll just say

2444.72 --> 2448.56
yes to whatever they'll not even think

2447.52 --> 2450.48
about it

2448.56 --> 2452.24
and don't forget about the propaganda i

2450.48 --> 2455.359
mean every

2452.24 --> 2457.1189999999997
evening there's a talk show uh including

2455.359 --> 2459.839
a virologist and

2457.119 --> 2461.6800000000003
telling you how bad the situation is and

2459.839 --> 2463.839
how lucky we are with the

2461.68 --> 2466.0
measurements that they that they took

2463.839 --> 2468.56
and so measurements you say

2466.0 --> 2471.28
yeah you mean statistical analysis

2468.56 --> 2473.92
[Laughter]

2471.28 --> 2475.6800000000003
uh yeah i know i know exactly i'm i'm

2473.92 --> 2476.64
shoving it to you because you are the

2475.68 --> 2478.3999999999996
messenger

2476.64 --> 2480.24
and i'll get confronted again with how

2478.4 --> 2482.8
shitty it is out there

2480.24 --> 2484.56
the dutch talk shows is just it's

2482.8 --> 2486.319
atrocious to behold

2484.56 --> 2488.7999999999997
like i can't believe people are actually

2486.319 --> 2492.839
watching that

2488.8 --> 2495.8390000000004
yeah that was even before corona it was

2492.839 --> 2495.839
disgusting

2497.44 --> 2502.319
but right so people are just going to

2501.04 --> 2504.24
keep on following it

2502.319 --> 2506.16
i guess there's going to be a whole lot

2504.24 --> 2509.839
of vaccination deaths here in the

2506.16 --> 2509.839
netherlands because people want that

2510.079 --> 2513.8390000000004
have you noticed that there's this

2511.52 --> 2515.119
craziness also concerning that going on

2513.839 --> 2517.44
not just in the netherlands but

2515.119 --> 2520.079
everywhere that

2517.44 --> 2521.119
people are really willing to just take

2520.079 --> 2524.8
the vaccination

2521.119 --> 2525.119
and die yeah there are stories like they

2524.8 --> 2528.5600000000004
are

2525.119 --> 2531.28
willing to die just to go

2528.56 --> 2532.319
it's it's become that it's become like

2531.28 --> 2535.0400000000004
that people are

2532.319 --> 2536.319
really like virtue signaling like yes

2535.04 --> 2539.44
i'll do it

2536.319 --> 2541.52
it's i wonder sometimes if

2539.44 --> 2543.92
even the weenie people just realized

2541.52 --> 2544.8
it's a giant sacrificial ritual and it's

2543.92 --> 2547.119
just like

2544.8 --> 2548.8390000000004
nope they're not going to stop until x

2547.119 --> 2551.359
amount of people

2548.839 --> 2553.52
die and maybe they

2551.359 --> 2556.88
know it and they're just sacrificing

2553.52 --> 2556.88
themselves for everybody

2557.76 --> 2562.7200000000003
maybe very grim approaches but i feel

2561.28 --> 2564.8
like that's something it's like why

2562.72 --> 2566.24
else would you do that with everything

2564.8 --> 2570.1600000000003
that's known

2566.24 --> 2572.0
it's like it's it's it's the difficult

2570.16 --> 2575.359
situation at this point because

2572.0 --> 2578.16
um multiple factors

2575.359 --> 2578.64
can't count right now it's what we are

2578.16 --> 2580.8799999999997
we are

2578.64 --> 2581.92
being told that it is a new type of

2580.88 --> 2585.6800000000003
injectable right

2581.92 --> 2587.04
so um then then we have the stories

2585.68 --> 2590.319
about

2587.04 --> 2591.2799999999997
people having adverse reactions uh we

2590.319 --> 2594.96
know

2591.28 --> 2595.44
that uh it is being uh made in record

2594.96 --> 2599.04
time

2595.44 --> 2602.48
and we know that they say there are

2599.04 --> 2604.56
they tested it on uh thousands

2602.48 --> 2605.52
tens of thousands of people that they

2604.56 --> 2609.92
tell you

2605.52 --> 2612.319
um but they they will tell you well

2609.92 --> 2613.44
of course we can make it in a record

2612.319 --> 2616.88
time because we have

2613.44 --> 2620.64
had all our resources focused on

2616.88 --> 2623.76
the creation of this injectable but

2620.64 --> 2626.8799999999997
for me the the problem lies

2623.76 --> 2630.1600000000003
in the testing phase where they

2626.88 --> 2633.2000000000003
i think of i believe they skipped a

2630.16 --> 2634.56
a big part of the testing phase right

2633.2 --> 2637.68
because you cannot

2634.56 --> 2641.2
uh increase the time

2637.68 --> 2641.9199999999996
right so it's difficult for you to say

2641.2 --> 2644.319
well we've

2641.92 --> 2646.2400000000002
tested it in a long period they tested

2644.319 --> 2649.2
it in a few months so

2646.24 --> 2649.52
it's it's a difficult uh thing to say

2649.2 --> 2652.48
that

2649.52 --> 2654.319
it's it's safe that's that's my personal

2652.48 --> 2656.8
opinion it's not medical advice but

2654.319 --> 2658.24
my personal opinion i might believe it's

2656.8 --> 2661.52
telling me that it's

2658.24 --> 2663.839
it how can you skip so much time testing

2661.52 --> 2663.839
it

2664.16 --> 2668.7999999999997
i i gotta i got a better one for you why

2667.119 --> 2671.599
do they think that they can make a

2668.8 --> 2674.48
vaccine against this

2671.599 --> 2675.44
when a virus is known to be extremely

2674.48 --> 2678.88
elusive

2675.44 --> 2679.2000000000003
like any like flu vaccines have existed

2678.88 --> 2683.03
for

2679.2 --> 2684.24
decades and they've never worked

2683.03 --> 2687.3590000000004
[Music]

2684.24 --> 2689.839
never and it's like it's

2687.359 --> 2690.4
physically impossible for them to work

2689.839 --> 2694.24
because

2690.4 --> 2695.599
viruses you can make a vaccine for a

2694.24 --> 2697.68
taxes an amount of time

2695.599 --> 2699.52
supposedly you can make for it and then

2697.68 --> 2701.2799999999997
it's already going to be outdated it's

2699.52 --> 2704.72
not going to protect anymore from

2701.28 --> 2706.5600000000004
outside viruses because it's going to

2704.72 --> 2709.839
supposedly mutate so even

2706.56 --> 2712.319
from the virus concept

2709.839 --> 2713.44
taking that for granted that it's real

2712.319 --> 2716.48
the vaccines

2713.44 --> 2716.88
don't work because they can't work like

2716.48 --> 2719.76
they

2716.88 --> 2720.1600000000003
can't work even within the theory so

2719.76 --> 2722.3190000000004
this

2720.16 --> 2724.0789999999997
and then you rush it oh yeah rush it to

2722.319 --> 2726.0
make it quicker well it's still not

2724.079 --> 2727.599
going to work

2726.0 --> 2729.68
because how long is that going to last

2727.599 --> 2732.319
until it becomes completely invalid and

2729.68 --> 2736.0789999999997
then what's the point of constantly

2732.319 --> 2738.48
having a vaccine every month

2736.079 --> 2740.079
it's not working it's never going to

2738.48 --> 2741.76
work

2740.079 --> 2744.2400000000002
and besides what they put in these

2741.76 --> 2747.599
vaccines now it's experimental

2744.24 --> 2751.319
it doesn't even abide by

2747.599 --> 2754.96
normal uh what is it

2751.319 --> 2756.96
immunization theory it doesn't even but

2754.96 --> 2759.119
it's just like okay they're just going

2756.96 --> 2761.04
to medically experiment on you with

2759.119 --> 2764.079
genetics and [ __ ]

2761.04 --> 2766.16
and they it's not even going to help

2764.079 --> 2768.1600000000003
it's not even

2766.16 --> 2770.24
we don't know what it's going to do it's

2768.16 --> 2772.0
it's just a giant experiment it doesn't

2770.24 --> 2776.8799999999997
even abide by

2772.0 --> 2780.24
immunization theory it's totally insane

2776.88 --> 2783.359
in my opinion yeah in my opinion

2780.24 --> 2785.52
um the long-term effects

2783.359 --> 2786.96
will will be interesting right we we

2785.52 --> 2791.2
know we

2786.96 --> 2793.839
you if you hear the stories about

2791.2 --> 2795.839
what's uh happening now with the people

2793.839 --> 2799.119
who get the new injectable

2795.839 --> 2800.7999999999997
uh you get people who uh get [ __ ]

2799.119 --> 2804.319
reaction or

2800.8 --> 2806.4
heavy reactions um they will tell you

2804.319 --> 2808.319
well yeah that's normal because some

2806.4 --> 2812.88
people do

2808.319 --> 2815.359
so it but the long-term reactions or

2812.88 --> 2816.88
adverse reactions will be interesting

2815.359 --> 2819.52
because we don't know what what will

2816.88 --> 2823.04
happen in in a few years

2819.52 --> 2827.52
that's just clearly not um

2823.04 --> 2829.92
investigated as they admit right

2827.52 --> 2831.92
right because they're literally

2829.92 --> 2832.96
experimenting with something new and

2831.92 --> 2835.04
just forcing it

2832.96 --> 2836.079
on the public trying to force it on

2835.04 --> 2839.44
there instead of

2836.079 --> 2841.3590000000004
just behind closed doors long-term

2839.44 --> 2843.52
medical experiment

2841.359 --> 2845.5989999999997
which can be done with fall people on a

2843.52 --> 2846.4
voluntary basis they can be paid to do

2845.599 --> 2848.88
that

2846.4 --> 2851.44
on a voluntary basis is how the medical

2848.88 --> 2853.92
industry does these things normally

2851.44 --> 2855.119
but now it's just being pushed that's

2853.92 --> 2858.8
crazy

2855.119 --> 2861.599
it's pushed by propaganda mainly so

2858.8 --> 2863.52
the only thing that can help us and

2861.599 --> 2866.559
these are the words of our

2863.52 --> 2869.28
minister of health is the new injectable

2866.559 --> 2871.119
so that's that's the thing that they

2869.28 --> 2875.2000000000003
want to push and

2871.119 --> 2877.599
you have to um think about it

2875.2 --> 2878.64
why do we need so much propaganda to

2877.599 --> 2881.599
push this

2878.64 --> 2882.319
i for me i don't understand why do we

2881.599 --> 2885.6800000000003
need these

2882.319 --> 2886.079
propaganda our health ministers saying

2885.68 --> 2888.24
well

2886.079 --> 2889.6800000000003
the only thing that can save us is this

2888.24 --> 2892.7999999999997
new injectable

2889.68 --> 2893.359
it's it's a lie it's a lie and it's a

2892.8 --> 2896.2400000000002
fraud

2893.359 --> 2898.72
he doesn't know if it can do that it

2896.24 --> 2901.2
probably can't but he doesn't know

2898.72 --> 2903.2
he i don't understand why he can he why

2901.2 --> 2906.24
is even allowed to make that claim

2903.2 --> 2907.68
in function i don't understand i don't

2906.24 --> 2911.04
understand why he's just

2907.68 --> 2914.5589999999997
allowed to do that when it's obviously

2911.04 --> 2917.52
that at such a moment he is well

2914.559 --> 2918.2400000000002
shilling for the medical industry can't

2917.52 --> 2920.8
get more

2918.24 --> 2922.3999999999996
shilling than that because he's just

2920.8 --> 2924.079
saying no this is the only thing that

2922.4 --> 2926.319
works on corporate product

2924.079 --> 2927.2000000000003
which he doesn't know he shouldn't be

2926.319 --> 2929.839
able to know

2927.2 --> 2931.9199999999996
it's experimental how can he say it's

2929.839 --> 2934.24
the only thing that helps

2931.92 --> 2935.44
he can't it's a lie he should be

2934.24 --> 2938.16
arrested

2935.44 --> 2940.319
for doing that in my opinion because

2938.16 --> 2943.04
it's fraud it's fraud he's literally

2940.319 --> 2944.24
shilling for mega corporations and i'll

2943.04 --> 2946.48
bet you

2944.24 --> 2947.359
there's a i think there might already

2946.48 --> 2950.319
been

2947.359 --> 2952.24
like bribery situations happening

2950.319 --> 2955.599
concerning that

2952.24 --> 2958.8799999999997
right well

2955.599 --> 2961.92
um the thing is

2958.88 --> 2964.7200000000003
he also compared it with eating

2961.92 --> 2967.2000000000003
uh fast food right he said well people

2964.72 --> 2970.7999999999997
are complaining and asking what's in it

2967.2 --> 2974.5589999999997
right they are scared of the

2970.8 --> 2975.28
ingredients so then he he went on and

2974.559 --> 2978.6400000000003
but people

2975.28 --> 2980.88
are eating um fast food every day and

2978.64 --> 2982.24
you don't ask why what's in the fast

2980.88 --> 2985.28
food right so

2982.24 --> 2989.5989999999997
it's real weird this

2985.28 --> 2992.8
uh comparison um comparing an injectable

2989.599 --> 2992.8
with eating fast food

2993.599 --> 2998.2400000000002
well i think it's weird yes both are bad

2997.44 --> 3000.88
though

2998.24 --> 3001.68
by the way like fast food have you

3000.88 --> 3005.04
noticed that

3001.68 --> 3006.72
some really dude stupid

3005.04 --> 3008.079
i think there's medical industrial

3006.72 --> 3011.1189999999997
complex shells

3008.079 --> 3012.88
disgusting scumbags in chat and they're

3011.119 --> 3014.88
all gonna get banned

3012.88 --> 3017.119
you want your [ __ ] injectable you

3014.88 --> 3020.7200000000003
stick it up your ass you hear me

3017.119 --> 3023.119
you stick it up your ass and die get the

3020.72 --> 3025.4399999999996
[ __ ] out we're talking about real stuff

3023.119 --> 3028.1600000000003
in here yeah for me it's a personal

3025.44 --> 3030.0
uh thing right so whatever it's a

3028.16 --> 3031.2799999999997
personal thing that everybody needs to

3030.0 --> 3034.8
decide for its own

3031.28 --> 3037.6800000000003
and again i'm not giving out medical

3034.8 --> 3039.119
advice if you need medical advice go to

3037.68 --> 3041.1189999999997
your doctor and ask

3039.119 --> 3043.119
what's up right so and maybe you have a

3041.119 --> 3046.0
doctor who's informed and tell you

3043.119 --> 3046.6400000000003
tells you well these are the these could

3046.0 --> 3049.839
be the

3046.64 --> 3053.52
reactions this is the risk

3049.839 --> 3055.2799999999997
so yeah it's a personal decision

3053.52 --> 3057.7599999999998
for me and it should be a personal

3055.28 --> 3059.52
decision and the thing i am

3057.76 --> 3062.2400000000002
having problems with is that they are

3059.52 --> 3064.72
going to say probably i don't know

3062.24 --> 3065.839
these are the things you read and hear

3064.72 --> 3068.64
about

3065.839 --> 3069.52
is they're going to say well people who

3068.64 --> 3071.92
don't want the

3069.52 --> 3072.96
the injectable aren't allowed in certain

3071.92 --> 3075.6800000000003
places

3072.96 --> 3076.7200000000003
which for me is discrimination at that

3075.68 --> 3079.839
point

3076.72 --> 3082.8799999999997
um that's the thing i have

3079.839 --> 3085.599
for examination how about just

3082.88 --> 3086.48
that's a violation of constitutional

3085.599 --> 3090.0
rights

3086.48 --> 3092.96
it's to move where you where you want

3090.0 --> 3094.8
now of course corporations can

3092.96 --> 3098.319
potentially do that even though

3094.8 --> 3101.3590000000004
they are usually barraged by scandal

3098.319 --> 3104.319
and then made out for discriminatory

3101.359 --> 3107.359
but of course yeah the media is totally

3104.319 --> 3109.92
and utterly corrupt and part of this so

3107.359 --> 3111.2799999999997
if corporations start to discriminate

3109.92 --> 3114.7200000000003
like you say

3111.28 --> 3116.7200000000003
for this then media is actually just

3114.72 --> 3119.359
going to applaud them

3116.72 --> 3121.359
because the media is utterly utterly

3119.359 --> 3123.5989999999997
politically corrupt

3121.359 --> 3124.88
like all this the whole range of it

3123.599 --> 3127.52
should be sacked and

3124.88 --> 3128.96
jailed in my opinion but yeah how do you

3127.52 --> 3131.28
do that

3128.96 --> 3133.68
we have to work out how they have been

3131.28 --> 3135.52
fraudulent and corrupt

3133.68 --> 3136.96
right and i don't know how that works

3135.52 --> 3139.7599999999998
because there is still such a thing as

3136.96 --> 3143.28
freedom of speech even freedom to lie

3139.76 --> 3146.48
unfortunately but yeah

3143.28 --> 3148.3190000000004
it's gone too far it's like media is not

3146.48 --> 3149.52
doing what it's supposed to be doing now

3148.319 --> 3152.48
it has been like that

3149.52 --> 3154.559
for over a decade i think and grown a

3152.48 --> 3156.48
lot worse

3154.559 --> 3157.8390000000004
but yeah i don't know what to do about

3156.48 --> 3161.04
it but

3157.839 --> 3161.599
yeah the discrimination like government

3161.04 --> 3164.16
can't

3161.599 --> 3165.28
do that like they can really not do that

3164.16 --> 3168.64
they can't tell no

3165.28 --> 3170.3190000000004
you can't come here because of

3168.64 --> 3173.04
whatever because you didn't get a

3170.319 --> 3175.839
vaccine corporations unfortunately

3173.04 --> 3175.839
can do that

3176.319 --> 3182.16
and this is probably the way they will

3179.359 --> 3183.119
go right they will say well you can't go

3182.16 --> 3186.0789999999997
with an airplane

3183.119 --> 3187.76
and if you don't have your your

3186.079 --> 3192.0
injectable you can't go in

3187.76 --> 3195.2000000000003
in an airplane so that right there is

3192.0 --> 3197.119
excluding people and for me in my

3195.2 --> 3200.04
opinion is a bad thing

3197.119 --> 3201.6800000000003
right but yeah unfortunately we're all

3200.04 --> 3203.359
privatized

3201.68 --> 3206.16
and that means it's in the hands of

3203.359 --> 3206.7999999999997
corporations like including transport

3206.16 --> 3209.319
issues and

3206.8 --> 3211.04
if they choose for whatever corporate

3209.319 --> 3214.72
conspiratorial reason

3211.04 --> 3216.5589999999997
to [ __ ] everything up they can

3214.72 --> 3218.0
unless the government pushes to stop

3216.559 --> 3220.8
that but it's in there

3218.0 --> 3222.0
they are in with it it's fascism it's

3220.8 --> 3223.92
technically fascism

3222.0 --> 3225.52
there's the conspiracy between

3223.92 --> 3228.8
corporations media

3225.52 --> 3232.319
and government to absolutely

3228.8 --> 3236.96
psychologically and medically strangle

3232.319 --> 3238.64
the people into submission and death

3236.96 --> 3241.119
and that's going on and it's going on

3238.64 --> 3243.2799999999997
worldwide and the netherlands is

3241.119 --> 3244.319
just as much subject as any other

3243.28 --> 3248.4
country

3244.319 --> 3250.72
like that and it's a terrible situation

3248.4 --> 3252.559
yeah i do believe in personal

3250.72 --> 3255.5989999999997
responsibility right in and

3252.559 --> 3257.119
taking uh the responsibility for your

3255.599 --> 3260.7200000000003
own actions and

3257.119 --> 3264.1600000000003
if you if everybody just does this

3260.72 --> 3266.0789999999997
and don't listen to the to the

3264.16 --> 3269.04
propaganda then it

3266.079 --> 3271.119
should be done with it pretty fast right

3269.04 --> 3273.92
if everybody just says no

3271.119 --> 3275.28
it's the easiest thing to do just say no

3273.92 --> 3278.4
and then

3275.28 --> 3282.48
what else do they have it is us

3278.4 --> 3286.96
agreeing with it it is us that uh comply

3282.48 --> 3290.2400000000002
so if everybody just says no then it's

3286.96 --> 3291.2
pretty um yeah then they have nothing

3290.24 --> 3293.7599999999998
right

3291.2 --> 3296.0789999999997
well then they can still just choose to

3293.76 --> 3298.96
enforce it

3296.079 --> 3299.52
but that's gonna give a whole ruckus and

3298.96 --> 3301.28
yeah

3299.52 --> 3303.839
definitely gonna aggravate things but

3301.28 --> 3307.0400000000004
they can still do that you know

3303.839 --> 3310.48
well looking at italy um i'm seeing

3307.04 --> 3314.799
reports of the of the restaurants

3310.48 --> 3316.88
and um going uh

3314.799 --> 3318.24
they're opening again on their own

3316.88 --> 3319.92
accounts i mean

3318.24 --> 3322.0789999999997
they still have a lockdown but they are

3319.92 --> 3325.76
are going open again

3322.079 --> 3327.8390000000004
to earn some money nice all right

3325.76 --> 3329.2000000000003
but they're probably gonna get fines and

3327.839 --> 3332.0
[ __ ]

3329.2 --> 3334.0
from that and then are they gonna pay it

3332.0 --> 3336.0
are they gonna try it what i suggest

3334.0 --> 3338.16
and just say no we're just going to

3336.0 --> 3342.16
ignore this illegal taxation

3338.16 --> 3344.319
and fines because it's all illegal

3342.16 --> 3346.0789999999997
it's all fake and illegal they shouldn't

3344.319 --> 3347.119
be able to do this and there is no

3346.079 --> 3350.2400000000002
emergency there

3347.119 --> 3353.44
literally is no pandemic no medical

3350.24 --> 3356.799
emergency it's a giant fraud

3353.44 --> 3360.0
and it's being used by corporations

3356.799 --> 3363.44
government and media to crack down

3360.0 --> 3366.16
on people and on people's businesses

3363.44 --> 3367.359
literally to bring them in shackles

3366.16 --> 3371.2799999999997
bring them in

3367.359 --> 3374.4
slavery and yeah that's a neo-feudal

3371.28 --> 3377.52
form of slavery a corporatist

3374.4 --> 3380.799
slavery yeah the funny thing i always

3377.52 --> 3385.7599999999998
um mention is that the

3380.799 --> 3388.16
15th of march 2020 we went into lockdown

3385.76 --> 3388.88
three days later the mcdonald's was open

3388.16 --> 3392.319
again

3388.88 --> 3393.04
i mean that's just of course you

3392.319 --> 3396.48
wouldn't want to

3393.04 --> 3397.839
deprive people from their death food

3396.48 --> 3399.839
you know they still need that

3397.839 --> 3401.52
opportunity to be able to kill people

3399.839 --> 3403.2
off very quickly through their own

3401.52 --> 3406.48
stupidity

3403.2 --> 3407.2
can't close that it's a big corporation

3406.48 --> 3409.52
right so they

3407.2 --> 3411.1189999999997
they right there and they kill people

3409.52 --> 3412.559
with their food yeah i said it

3411.119 --> 3415.6800000000003
mcdonald's yeah your

3412.559 --> 3418.079
your food kills people yeah

3415.68 --> 3419.5989999999997
historically there's documentaries about

3418.079 --> 3423.04
it yeah your food

3419.599 --> 3423.6800000000003
kills people that's right so of course

3423.04 --> 3427.2799999999997
you're

3423.68 --> 3429.5989999999997
allowed to stay open when all the other

3427.28 --> 3430.799
regular restaurants that make actual

3429.599 --> 3432.96
food

3430.799 --> 3435.119
that nourishes you and feeds you they

3432.96 --> 3438.4
can't stay open but mcdonald's can

3435.119 --> 3438.4
of course makes sense

3442.799 --> 3447.839
still there yeah i'm still here all

3445.04 --> 3447.839
right

3448.319 --> 3452.24
and getting all worked up over this yeah

3450.24 --> 3455.52
no problem i i i feel you

3452.24 --> 3459.2
i mean uh it's it's just

3455.52 --> 3461.599
the fact that and this is

3459.2 --> 3463.4399999999996
again going back to taking personal

3461.599 --> 3467.04
responsibility and just saying no

3463.44 --> 3470.0
i mean if everybody just comes

3467.04 --> 3470.96
to the realization that that you you

3470.0 --> 3473.76
yourself

3470.96 --> 3474.079
and people around you have the power to

3473.76 --> 3477.28
do

3474.079 --> 3479.119
something i mean the the

3477.28 --> 3481.28
the thing you always hear is what what

3479.119 --> 3484.559
can i do alone what can i do alone

3481.28 --> 3485.28
yeah sure but if everybody just stands

3484.559 --> 3488.7200000000003
up and says

3485.28 --> 3489.44
no then it's all done it's just stops

3488.72 --> 3492.48
right

3489.44 --> 3493.44
now in italy that a lot of restaurants

3492.48 --> 3496.0
are going open and

3493.44 --> 3497.68
just says well screw you i need to make

3496.0 --> 3500.24
some money because or else

3497.68 --> 3502.799
everything i've built up in the last 10

3500.24 --> 3505.4399999999996
years 15 years right people have

3502.799 --> 3506.64
uh own shops and restaurants and they

3505.44 --> 3510.4
build it up and they

3506.64 --> 3512.24
put all their heart all their hard work

3510.4 --> 3512.88
in it their blood sweat and tears into

3512.24 --> 3516.72
it their

3512.88 --> 3518.6400000000003
passion into their uh their work

3516.72 --> 3520.0
cooking meals for others right right and

3518.64 --> 3523.2799999999997
their clientele there

3520.0 --> 3525.28
they have connections with the people

3523.28 --> 3527.2000000000003
that know that and that are counting on

3525.28 --> 3528.96
it and all that so

3527.2 --> 3530.8799999999997
it's not even their own personal work

3528.96 --> 3534.559
it's also they provide a service

3530.88 --> 3536.559
and people use that

3534.559 --> 3539.52
they need that they need opportunities

3536.559 --> 3541.0400000000004
to not always be forced to just go back

3539.52 --> 3545.119
home and make your own meals

3541.04 --> 3548.079
because i don't know business travel so

3545.119 --> 3550.079
and hey it's also a good restaurant

3548.079 --> 3553.2000000000003
traditionally good place to meet or

3550.079 --> 3556.6400000000003
have a date you know right

3553.2 --> 3560.24
so it's needed it's part of our culture

3556.64 --> 3560.24
culture right right

3560.64 --> 3563.92
but yeah that's interesting to hear that

3562.4 --> 3566.64
they in italy they are

3563.92 --> 3568.48
opening up against the regulations but i

3566.64 --> 3570.0789999999997
think that only can really work if

3568.48 --> 3573.839
everybody's mind

3570.079 --> 3576.48
and hearts are at that like one

3573.839 --> 3578.24
business owner can decide to like oh i'm

3576.48 --> 3580.079
just not gonna do it

3578.24 --> 3582.0
right but if everybody if everybody else

3580.079 --> 3583.92
is gonna be like they're not complying

3582.0 --> 3584.4
to corona yeah they're gonna get screwed

3583.92 --> 3587.44
over

3584.4 --> 3590.559
it really requires everybody to be

3587.44 --> 3594.319
like with them to to want to defend them

3590.559 --> 3596.0
against the situation so if that's

3594.319 --> 3597.359
happening in italy that sounds really

3596.0 --> 3599.44
cool

3597.359 --> 3601.68
because that's a sign that the people

3599.44 --> 3604.079
are getting united against

3601.68 --> 3606.24
the government policies with that i

3604.079 --> 3608.4
don't know if that's happening over here

3606.24 --> 3610.0
though i don't know if if we're there

3608.4 --> 3613.28
there are talks about that

3610.0 --> 3616.079
um last year there was um

3613.28 --> 3617.92
there were talks about the restaurants

3616.079 --> 3621.119
wanted to open the 17th

3617.92 --> 3624.2400000000002
of january but i don't know if that gets

3621.119 --> 3627.28
a lot of traction because yeah tomorrow

3624.24 --> 3630.3999999999996
or last year this year but

3627.28 --> 3633.599
tomorrow maybe maybe tomorrow 2017. so

3630.4 --> 3637.76
yeah yeah you're correct but that was

3633.599 --> 3641.04
last year i heard about it i the latest

3637.76 --> 3644.079
uh news is they want to open the 20th

3641.04 --> 3645.359
right but i don't know netherlands is

3644.079 --> 3647.76
pretty

3645.359 --> 3649.68
hard to say it cocked so there they

3647.76 --> 3652.88
believe the narrative so that's

3649.68 --> 3654.96
that's the whole deal

3652.88 --> 3656.88
right well they believe the narrative or

3654.96 --> 3659.119
their or

3656.88 --> 3661.6800000000003
they're just too afraid others will

3659.119 --> 3661.6800000000003
believe it

3661.76 --> 3665.8390000000004
that can be it too you know because i

3664.079 --> 3666.96
think that a lot of dutch people don't

3665.839 --> 3670.96
really believe it

3666.96 --> 3673.04
they just don't want to ruffle feathers

3670.96 --> 3674.7200000000003
so they do it anyway they do it for the

3673.04 --> 3677.7599999999998
others see

3674.72 --> 3679.68
right and and i think that's a problem i

3677.76 --> 3680.1600000000003
think more dutch people should be just

3679.68 --> 3682.799
like no

3680.16 --> 3685.5989999999997
screw that but yeah then again the

3682.799 --> 3688.4
netherlands has been culturally

3685.599 --> 3689.119
working against that sort of spirit

3688.4 --> 3691.92
against

3689.119 --> 3693.28
that specifically for like half a

3691.92 --> 3697.079
century

3693.28 --> 3699.28
to get like that robust self-resilient

3697.079 --> 3701.92
characteristics out of the netherlands

3699.28 --> 3706.0
and make everybody into uniformity

3701.92 --> 3706.0
yeah [ __ ] yeah

3706.16 --> 3710.96
i i feel that the netherlands are are

3709.28 --> 3714.559
pretty obedient

3710.96 --> 3718.319
people are pretty obedient so yeah

3714.559 --> 3721.3590000000004
and and then it again goes to personal

3718.319 --> 3723.52
responsibility and and not only

3721.359 --> 3725.359
listening to the official narrative and

3723.52 --> 3728.16
do your own research and

3725.359 --> 3728.5589999999997
figure out what's real and what what is

3728.16 --> 3732.0
is it

3728.559 --> 3734.88
they want to push right it's just an

3732.0 --> 3735.28
obvious example if you see if you only

3734.88 --> 3737.2000000000003
see

3735.28 --> 3738.48
propaganda on the television telling you

3737.2 --> 3743.0389999999998
how bad it is

3738.48 --> 3745.599
i mean doesn't that tell you something

3743.039 --> 3746.4
and then you look around you and you

3745.599 --> 3749.599
don't see

3746.4 --> 3751.039
people falling down death on dead on the

3749.599 --> 3754.4
street like we saw

3751.039 --> 3756.6400000000003
uh in china right you all saw the

3754.4 --> 3758.64
videos of people lying dead in the

3756.64 --> 3761.359
street that that didn't happen in the

3758.64 --> 3762.48
western world i don't think that that

3761.359 --> 3764.5589999999997
was real

3762.48 --> 3766.96
yeah i think that between the situation

3764.559 --> 3769.119
was the giant crisis act i think it was

3766.96 --> 3771.44
completely faked

3769.119 --> 3773.52
well but that was the thing they brought

3771.44 --> 3776.96
to us right that was the thing that

3773.52 --> 3777.599
made the world decide to go into

3776.96 --> 3781.28
lockdown

3777.599 --> 3785.44
so and now we are we're a year

3781.28 --> 3785.44
almost a year further uh

3786.079 --> 3792.319
yeah but in they're having regular

3789.28 --> 3794.96
giant people parties yeah they're

3792.319 --> 3796.5589999999997
yeah so they're they're over it like

3794.96 --> 3799.359
literally over it they're all

3796.559 --> 3800.96
crowded people within half a meter

3799.359 --> 3802.64
distance from one another and then a

3800.96 --> 3805.119
couple of thousands or ten

3802.64 --> 3805.92
thousand people in a giant stadium

3805.119 --> 3809.039
having fun

3805.92 --> 3810.079
partying so they don't give a [ __ ]

3809.039 --> 3811.6800000000003
anymore

3810.079 --> 3814.1600000000003
and we're all still stuck with this

3811.68 --> 3814.16
nonsense

3815.839 --> 3822.839
what'd you say no i didn't say anything

3819.039 --> 3826.2400000000002
no and i said wouldn't you say oh

3822.839 --> 3829.0389999999998
um about wuhan right there's

3826.24 --> 3830.799
they're just they're over it it's done

3829.039 --> 3833.28
they have no more measures

3830.799 --> 3834.96
and we're here in the netherlands and in

3833.28 --> 3835.28
the rest of europe and america and all

3834.96 --> 3838.079
that

3835.28 --> 3838.48
still stuck with this nonsense right

3838.079 --> 3842.2400000000002
yeah

3838.48 --> 3844.799
i've seen a few um videos of

3842.24 --> 3846.0789999999997
really big parties and they claim it's

3844.799 --> 3849.599
in wuhan

3846.079 --> 3850.1600000000003
um yeah it's true it's pretty difficult

3849.599 --> 3853.76
to get

3850.16 --> 3857.2799999999997
information from that place same as

3853.76 --> 3860.7200000000003
uh it was at the beginning we only get

3857.28 --> 3864.48
fed what they wanted us to see so it's

3860.72 --> 3867.68
it's a difficult concern in china but

3864.48 --> 3869.76
if we want to believe that what we were

3867.68 --> 3872.0
being fed was real then

3869.76 --> 3873.2000000000003
i would have expected to see people

3872.0 --> 3874.96
dropping dead

3873.2 --> 3876.5589999999997
here on in the streets of the

3874.96 --> 3880.16
netherlands but it didn't happen

3876.559 --> 3882.7200000000003
so um now we are in this situation

3880.16 --> 3883.68
where they tell you it's really bad and

3882.72 --> 3887.2799999999997
uh but

3883.68 --> 3890.319
we are in in this now like a year and

3887.28 --> 3891.039
um when you ask around in your own

3890.319 --> 3894.319
family

3891.039 --> 3896.88
uh i have i have a few family members

3894.319 --> 3899.44
who got a positive test but it

3896.88 --> 3900.079
didn't really flinch them at all they

3899.44 --> 3903.359
had a

3900.079 --> 3905.599
sore throat and that was it uh

3903.359 --> 3906.96
here and there a runny nose and after

3905.599 --> 3911.2000000000003
three days they were

3906.96 --> 3915.599
fine again so um

3911.2 --> 3917.5989999999997
yeah that doesn't compute in my head um

3915.599 --> 3918.88
what i observe and what i've been told

3917.599 --> 3921.119
right

3918.88 --> 3922.6400000000003
that's correct it's it's all nonsense

3921.119 --> 3926.079
what they've done

3922.64 --> 3928.8799999999997
and i also think that

3926.079 --> 3930.2400000000002
like i've just noticed and heard fear

3928.88 --> 3933.44
via others

3930.24 --> 3934.3999999999996
that a lot of the supposed medical

3933.44 --> 3936.4
experts

3934.4 --> 3938.64
now of course with fauci that's well

3936.4 --> 3940.0
known like they're supposed medical

3938.64 --> 3943.2799999999997
experts about these things

3940.0 --> 3946.16
and they're not even doctors like

3943.28 --> 3947.28
they don't even have a study they have

3946.16 --> 3949.2799999999997
nothing

3947.28 --> 3951.2000000000003
it's like they're not medical experts

3949.28 --> 3952.88
yet they're being forwarded as medical

3951.2 --> 3956.16
experts

3952.88 --> 3959.44
yeah yeah in my opinion

3956.16 --> 3963.359
is a crime it's a crime

3959.44 --> 3965.52
as a government to use medical experts

3963.359 --> 3966.64
that aren't actually medical experts

3965.52 --> 3970.4
that sounds like

3966.64 --> 3973.44
a crime to me

3970.4 --> 3975.839
in in in the netherlands

3973.44 --> 3978.4
the the the people in the the expert

3975.839 --> 3982.319
quantum court expert teams are vets

3978.4 --> 3982.319
so that's that's pretty funny right

3982.72 --> 3988.9599999999996
sorry um like the

3986.16 --> 3991.2799999999997
the top people in the in the team of

3988.96 --> 3994.96
experts that advise

3991.28 --> 4000.0
the the government right

3994.96 --> 4000.0
a few of them are vets veterinarians

4001.359 --> 4008.5589999999997
okay animal doctors yeah

4005.2 --> 4013.52
so so how does that make them virologist

4008.559 --> 4016.079
experts beats me

4013.52 --> 4019.28
it's like veterinarians typically don't

4016.079 --> 4021.6800000000003
even deal with that sort of thing

4019.28 --> 4023.44
with animals it's just like sometimes

4021.68 --> 4025.9199999999996
something goes around and then a lot of

4023.44 --> 4030.64
these animals die

4025.92 --> 4030.64
and that's it then they just move on

4030.72 --> 4035.68
and yeah it it just none of it makes any

4033.92 --> 4038.559
sense and

4035.68 --> 4040.0
right yeah these medical experts it's i

4038.559 --> 4042.0
think it's criminal that they

4040.0 --> 4043.839
are being used to basically

4042.0 --> 4047.2
indoctrinated people with

4043.839 --> 4049.44
false medical information false

4047.2 --> 4051.4399999999996
medical information propaganda that is

4049.44 --> 4053.52
being fed to the people by government

4051.44 --> 4055.92
and corporations as if it is

4053.52 --> 4057.2
legitimate medical information and it is

4055.92 --> 4059.44
not

4057.2 --> 4061.2799999999997
and there's so many people even like

4059.44 --> 4063.839
actual doctors coming out

4061.28 --> 4065.599
against it and they're getting all kinds

4063.839 --> 4068.48
of hassle and fired and

4065.599 --> 4069.2000000000003
terrible things those people that go out

4068.48 --> 4072.72
against it

4069.2 --> 4075.7599999999998
are actually doctors actually know

4072.72 --> 4079.2
what the hell it's all about and

4075.76 --> 4084.1600000000003
they're being just barraged

4079.2 --> 4084.16
it's crazy yeah yeah it's um

4084.799 --> 4088.0
there are doctors there are professors

4087.599 --> 4090.4
uh

4088.0 --> 4091.359
that go against the narrative and get

4090.4 --> 4094.7200000000003
indeed

4091.359 --> 4096.799
berated and censored and thrown off

4094.72 --> 4099.92
youtube or linkedin or

4096.799 --> 4103.199
so again it's

4099.92 --> 4105.279
um yeah how do you say this it's why do

4103.199 --> 4108.719
you need to

4105.279 --> 4112.319
throw these people off these platforms

4108.719 --> 4116.0
um these are also matter

4112.319 --> 4117.92
expert matter subjects right so

4116.0 --> 4119.839
why would why would you need to throw

4117.92 --> 4121.6
them off these platforms

4119.839 --> 4123.199
is it because they are going against

4121.6 --> 4126.319
your own narrative

4123.199 --> 4129.3589999999995
it just boggles me why people

4126.319 --> 4133.04
who also have learned to

4129.359 --> 4135.839
um with this uh for these kinds of

4133.04 --> 4137.679
situations have and and have a different

4135.839 --> 4139.839
opinion about the current state of

4137.679 --> 4143.52
affairs have to be

4139.839 --> 4146.64
thrown off platforms it's just yeah

4143.52 --> 4148.64
mind-boggling it's censorship and it's

4146.64 --> 4149.679
criminal and i wonder how long is this

4148.64 --> 4152.08
going to persist

4149.679 --> 4153.759
i think that people the government

4152.08 --> 4155.679
especially

4153.759 --> 4158.0
because they are responsible

4155.679 --> 4160.2390000000005
corporations unfortunately can be made

4158.0 --> 4163.359
to do whatever the [ __ ] they want

4160.239 --> 4165.839
that's the problem but yeah spreading

4163.359 --> 4166.64
false medical information by government

4165.839 --> 4170.3189999999995
is

4166.64 --> 4173.04
that's criminal i really want

4170.319 --> 4175.1990000000005
them them the government the ones that

4173.04 --> 4178.48
are onto this to be

4175.199 --> 4182.4
held accountable for that big time big

4178.48 --> 4185.199
time probably worldwide would be great

4182.4 --> 4186.5599999999995
to just get a couple of hundreds

4185.199 --> 4189.759
thousands of people

4186.56 --> 4193.92
in governments arrested for

4189.759 --> 4193.92
medical conspiracy against the people

4194.239 --> 4198.32
yeah it's it's a difficult situation

4197.84 --> 4201.52
again

4198.32 --> 4205.679
because when we look at

4201.52 --> 4209.6
history like for instance swine flu

4205.679 --> 4211.4400000000005
um it's it was called and this is freely

4209.6 --> 4212.719
translated from dutch to english the

4211.44 --> 4214.639999999999
mexican flu that

4212.719 --> 4216.4800000000005
that's what it was called induction in

4214.64 --> 4220.08
the netherlands

4216.48 --> 4223.919999999999
but it was worldwide it was called

4220.08 --> 4226.96
the swine flu and i remember that

4223.92 --> 4231.04
yeah so we

4226.96 --> 4234.4
when this came out then they tried to

4231.04 --> 4237.44
um scare us with this

4234.4 --> 4241.12
virus right with the swine flu and uh

4237.44 --> 4244.36
they ordered like 150 million

4241.12 --> 4247.679
don't pin me on this but it was like

4244.36 --> 4250.08
150 million dollars or euros of

4247.679 --> 4251.1990000000005
vaccinations and they threw out like 100

4250.08 --> 4253.92
million dollars

4251.199 --> 4255.44
euros of of that stuff because nobody

4253.92 --> 4258.32
needed it

4255.44 --> 4260.32
nobody wanted it nobody needed it the

4258.32 --> 4263.36
actual death count was

4260.32 --> 4264.32
pretty low but they started out saying

4263.36 --> 4268.4
it was

4264.32 --> 4271.92
a bad thing and we all could die and

4268.4 --> 4273.199
and again we have this situation where

4271.92 --> 4275.4400000000005
they are telling us we

4273.199 --> 4276.719
all can die but it isn't really

4275.44 --> 4280.879999999999
happening uh

4276.719 --> 4284.4800000000005
the last time i checked the

4280.88 --> 4288.159000000001
like 500 people died

4284.48 --> 4292.159
of corona that were below 65

4288.159 --> 4294.239
in the netherlands it's like 500 people

4292.159 --> 4297.5199999999995
and the rest were yeah the rest of the

4294.239 --> 4300.239
all those people were older

4297.52 --> 4301.040000000001
right but even then i don't think

4300.239 --> 4304.32
anybody's

4301.04 --> 4307.679
ever really actually died from corona

4304.32 --> 4310.08
it's always like okay it's the

4307.679 --> 4311.12
the cherry on top if they're in very bad

4310.08 --> 4314.0
shape

4311.12 --> 4315.5199999999995
then the corona can be that edge that

4314.0 --> 4318.88
drives them into death

4315.52 --> 4321.4400000000005
basically but it's normal normal people

4318.88 --> 4322.400000000001
like even elderly ones they don't die

4321.44 --> 4324.159
from this

4322.4 --> 4327.36
they just don't if they're in a good

4324.159 --> 4329.839999999999
condition they don't

4327.36 --> 4332.08
so i don't think that could even be said

4329.84 --> 4335.84
that anybody has ever died of it

4332.08 --> 4340.5599999999995
it's just that you can die having it

4335.84 --> 4342.719
doesn't mean that it killed you right

4340.56 --> 4344.88
and it's probably one of the least

4342.719 --> 4345.76
lethal diseases that has ever roamed the

4344.88 --> 4348.159000000001
earth

4345.76 --> 4349.52
well when i look at the world when i

4348.159 --> 4352.719
look at the world and i

4349.52 --> 4356.0
observe uh like autumn

4352.719 --> 4358.56
and winter then every time if every

4356.0 --> 4360.48
year as long as i can observe i can

4358.56 --> 4363.280000000001
observe it and remember it

4360.48 --> 4364.4
um every year in the autumn or in the

4363.28 --> 4366.8
winter

4364.4 --> 4367.599999999999
yeah there's a flu season it's every

4366.8 --> 4370.56
year

4367.6 --> 4371.92
and every year people die from

4370.56 --> 4376.400000000001
complications

4371.92 --> 4380.32
that go with the flu uh mostly elderly

4376.4 --> 4383.759999999999
yes flu season and allergy season

4380.32 --> 4386.5599999999995
sure both can be very dangerous but

4383.76 --> 4387.76
and you have heat like in the in the in

4386.56 --> 4391.1990000000005
the summer we have

4387.76 --> 4394.88
uh whenever there's a lot of heat

4391.199 --> 4395.839999999999
elderly also died stroke heat strokes

4394.88 --> 4399.28
yeah

4395.84 --> 4402.64
and now we have a situation where

4399.28 --> 4405.759999999999
corona started in in the winter

4402.64 --> 4408.4800000000005
in january right and people

4405.76 --> 4410.64
were labeled corona death and they they

4408.48 --> 4413.839999999999
got the test and they

4410.64 --> 4415.12
they labeled their cases right they they

4413.84 --> 4418.400000000001
upped their cases

4415.12 --> 4421.04
and when we were in uh

4418.4 --> 4422.239
in the summer in the netherlands cases

4421.04 --> 4425.199
uh

4422.239 --> 4426.959999999999
weren't there anymore hospitals were

4425.199 --> 4428.879999999999
empty

4426.96 --> 4430.56
people only died from heat strokes

4428.88 --> 4434.56
elderly and

4430.56 --> 4438.080000000001
again in the autumn now 2020 2021

4434.56 --> 4442.8
autumn winter the cases rise again so

4438.08 --> 4446.32
this is for me if i just observe it like

4442.8 --> 4448.0
the way i do it just looks like a flu

4446.32 --> 4450.799999999999
season to me

4448.0 --> 4452.08
yeah what what always it always happens

4450.8 --> 4455.1990000000005
especially look

4452.08 --> 4459.199
it also ties in with general moral

4455.199 --> 4462.0
morality so a lot of people get very

4459.199 --> 4462.799999999999
excited during the december month right

4462.0 --> 4464.719
there's like

4462.8 --> 4466.8
for us especially there's like sitter

4464.719 --> 4468.719
class in the early december

4466.8 --> 4470.159000000001
and there's old there's christmas and

4468.719 --> 4471.92
there's out the new

4470.159 --> 4474.08
like the new year celebration and

4471.92 --> 4476.32
there's a lot of excitement

4474.08 --> 4477.5199999999995
and usually a lot of drinking and all

4476.32 --> 4480.159
that and then

4477.52 --> 4482.080000000001
in january yeah it's like a vacuum

4480.159 --> 4483.759999999999
suddenly it's like oh

4482.08 --> 4485.44
there's nothing that's kind of

4483.76 --> 4488.56
demoralizing

4485.44 --> 4491.44
so that also contributes that people

4488.56 --> 4492.159000000001
will if they've been like holding off on

4491.44 --> 4494.159
being sick

4492.159 --> 4495.679
you probably you know about this it's

4494.159 --> 4496.0
like people that work my mother for

4495.679 --> 4499.76
example

4496.0 --> 4501.84
typically had this they

4499.76 --> 4502.96
they when they're very busy they don't

4501.84 --> 4505.1990000000005
have time

4502.96 --> 4506.0
to get sick it sounds weird but it

4505.199 --> 4509.04
really works that

4506.0 --> 4510.719
they just haul it off and then when it's

4509.04 --> 4512.88
over when they're in a vacation

4510.719 --> 4515.04
that's when the disease or whatever they

4512.88 --> 4517.84
got their condition completely strikes

4515.04 --> 4520.239
out and then they get really sick

4517.84 --> 4521.04
because they were very busy they didn't

4520.239 --> 4523.199
have time

4521.04 --> 4524.32
to get sick not really they had to

4523.199 --> 4525.839999999999
ignore it

4524.32 --> 4528.5599999999995
because otherwise things would go all

4525.84 --> 4531.12
wrong and then january is typical a

4528.56 --> 4533.52
vacuum month where suddenly

4531.12 --> 4534.32
all of these activities are over and

4533.52 --> 4537.6
then thus

4534.32 --> 4541.04
it's logical that people just get

4537.6 --> 4542.2390000000005
sick if they were bound to get it at

4541.04 --> 4544.8
some point

4542.239 --> 4545.839999999999
right typical it's just that's flu

4544.8 --> 4547.92
season

4545.84 --> 4549.12
it's also because of the the situation

4547.92 --> 4553.28
in which people

4549.12 --> 4556.239
arrive in their daily lives

4553.28 --> 4558.0
so and i look at it this way maybe it's

4556.239 --> 4561.5199999999995
uh maybe you

4558.0 --> 4565.44
can relate to it but going back to

4561.52 --> 4566.0
the fact that we whenever we look at the

4565.44 --> 4568.11
ottoman

4566.0 --> 4569.679
in winter and um

4568.11 --> 4573.04
[Music]

4569.679 --> 4574.88
it's every year in the ottoman winter

4573.04 --> 4576.08
there's a there's a quote-unquote flu

4574.88 --> 4578.64
season so

4576.08 --> 4580.0
for me if i look at it and observe it

4578.64 --> 4583.76
and analyze it it feels

4580.0 --> 4585.04
like that when when we go into this

4583.76 --> 4588.56
colder season

4585.04 --> 4591.76
our body is uh is trying to prepare

4588.56 --> 4592.56
uh for this season the cold and the wind

4591.76 --> 4596.0
and the rain

4592.56 --> 4598.4800000000005
and and therefore you get

4596.0 --> 4599.84
quote-unquote sick but this sickness

4598.48 --> 4602.959999999999
doesn't

4599.84 --> 4606.56
means that your body is one is trying to

4602.96 --> 4608.88
get rid of the um the

4606.56 --> 4610.320000000001
cortical toxins that's that's in your

4608.88 --> 4613.36
body at that point

4610.32 --> 4615.04
and tries to prepare yourself for the

4613.36 --> 4618.159
coming season right

4615.04 --> 4618.719
cleans you up for more reaction so this

4618.159 --> 4622.0
is the way

4618.719 --> 4624.64
i i feel about it um

4622.0 --> 4626.64
right and i totally agree that's and

4624.64 --> 4629.4400000000005
that's even like a core function

4626.64 --> 4630.400000000001
if you look at the terrain theory

4629.44 --> 4633.12
approach

4630.4 --> 4635.12
concerning viruses and diseases that is

4633.12 --> 4635.44
really how it does seem to work it's

4635.12 --> 4639.12
like

4635.44 --> 4639.759999999999
viruses are not invasive species micro

4639.12 --> 4641.599999999999
species

4639.76 --> 4643.84
whatever they're not even alive they're

4641.6 --> 4644.8
actually part of the body's cleanup

4643.84 --> 4646.8
systems

4644.8 --> 4648.96
it's often psychosomatically triggered

4646.8 --> 4651.04
you see other people sneezing around you

4648.96 --> 4652.88
you're more likely to start up that

4651.04 --> 4655.679
cycle your body just says

4652.88 --> 4658.2390000000005
okay it's time to do this now it's time

4655.679 --> 4658.88
to start cleaning up to clean house as

4658.239 --> 4661.12
it were

4658.88 --> 4662.400000000001
and then you become sick and then after

4661.12 --> 4664.96
you go through all that

4662.4 --> 4667.12
whatever you were you stacked up junk

4664.96 --> 4669.36
wise poison wise in your body or stress

4667.12 --> 4672.4
wise which also poisonous

4669.36 --> 4674.48
like for your body stores that yeah then

4672.4 --> 4675.679
that's all clean up and afterward you

4674.48 --> 4677.5199999999995
get out of it

4675.679 --> 4679.6
you're gonna have a lot of energy you're

4677.52 --> 4681.76
gonna be clearer

4679.6 --> 4683.280000000001
because getting sick like that

4681.76 --> 4686.719
especially things like a cold

4683.28 --> 4688.639999999999
it cleans you up it cleans you up on a

4686.719 --> 4689.6
cellular level that's what viruses

4688.64 --> 4693.92
really do

4689.6 --> 4696.08
they clean out the the micro toxins on a

4693.92 --> 4698.0
cellular level

4696.08 --> 4700.08
right and so yeah what you said makes a

4698.0 --> 4701.84
lot of sense to me i look at it as a

4700.08 --> 4705.04
pattern right when you when you observe

4701.84 --> 4707.92
the world the reality that you that you

4705.04 --> 4708.64
that you're in everything seems like a

4707.92 --> 4711.76
pattern

4708.64 --> 4715.12
uh the sun moving away

4711.76 --> 4716.56
the seasons uh life everything seems

4715.12 --> 4719.84
like a pattern

4716.56 --> 4722.8
and and so for me it does makes

4719.84 --> 4723.679
make sense that the flu season is also a

4722.8 --> 4726.88
pattern

4723.679 --> 4727.4400000000005
to make you prepare for the coming cold

4726.88 --> 4729.92
for the

4727.44 --> 4731.04
for the coming because yeah in the

4729.92 --> 4733.28
netherlands we

4731.04 --> 4735.199
we have a shady autumn right it always

4733.28 --> 4738.5599999999995
rains and

4735.199 --> 4740.5599999999995
the wind is cold and yeah your body

4738.56 --> 4744.2390000000005
needs to prepare for this

4740.56 --> 4748.159000000001
so it feels like me for me

4744.239 --> 4751.12
right right

4748.159 --> 4753.28
yep of course this cycles it's you build

4751.12 --> 4754.48
up a lot of stuff in the summer you get

4753.28 --> 4758.239
into action

4754.48 --> 4761.44
you absorb a lot of sun and then

4758.239 --> 4765.199
yeah during the the

4761.44 --> 4767.599999999999
uh what is it fall

4765.199 --> 4768.32
yeah what is it called again the autumn

4767.6 --> 4771.52
it's an autumn

4768.32 --> 4773.679
yeah right yeah things start to go

4771.52 --> 4776.080000000001
downhill in nature out there because the

4773.679 --> 4778.08
sunlight decreases the warmth goes away

4776.08 --> 4779.76
a little more moist especially in the

4778.08 --> 4782.4
netherlands so a lot of rain

4779.76 --> 4783.6
yeah because we are riverlands after all

4782.4 --> 4787.599999999999
and then

4783.6 --> 4790.88
yeah the body starts to basically

4787.6 --> 4794.08
transform how it works for yourself

4790.88 --> 4794.4800000000005
from being out there in the open in the

4794.08 --> 4796.96
heat

4794.48 --> 4798.48
and acting a lot and doing interacting

4796.96 --> 4800.4800000000005
with others a lot

4798.48 --> 4802.239
maybe procreation will be more on your

4800.48 --> 4803.12
mind for most people it is during the

4802.239 --> 4805.919999999999
summer

4803.12 --> 4807.36
time and then when winter comes it's

4805.92 --> 4809.84
like okay

4807.36 --> 4811.92
you have to prepare for it to become

4809.84 --> 4814.400000000001
very cold and the exact opposite

4811.92 --> 4816.4
of what the summer was so your body kind

4814.4 --> 4816.799999999999
of has to go through a transformation

4816.4 --> 4819.92
and

4816.8 --> 4821.12
yeah getting a cold and all that getting

4819.92 --> 4824.2390000000005
sick

4821.12 --> 4828.32
well may contribute to that conversion

4824.239 --> 4831.5199999999995
as it were like a pattern right

4828.32 --> 4835.04
that's why people get colds

4831.52 --> 4837.679
constantly every year almost

4835.04 --> 4839.28
like really big or really small but most

4837.679 --> 4842.32
do

4839.28 --> 4844.4
i do but with me it doesn't really

4842.32 --> 4847.44
express itself that big because i

4844.4 --> 4849.679
eat very healthy so with me colds

4847.44 --> 4851.759999999999
it's just literally a bunch of sniffles

4849.679 --> 4854.8
maybe a runny nose

4851.76 --> 4857.84
but even all that not that bad

4854.8 --> 4859.679
it just goes away very quickly so

4857.84 --> 4861.360000000001
there might have been times where i got

4859.679 --> 4863.92
the flu even

4861.36 --> 4864.48
but it just came out as a very minor

4863.92 --> 4867.52
cold

4864.48 --> 4870.159
that would go away very quickly

4867.52 --> 4871.76
i never had anything of it tested but it

4870.159 --> 4874.5599999999995
might have been because i haven't had

4871.76 --> 4878.88
any serious serious flu

4874.56 --> 4880.2390000000005
well since uh 2019 i did get it though

4878.88 --> 4883.6
but it was also

4880.239 --> 4884.799999999999
huge stress build up i was very stressed

4883.6 --> 4887.1990000000005
at that time right remember

4884.8 --> 4889.04
before the amsterdam conference went

4887.199 --> 4891.199
there and then after i already said like

4889.04 --> 4893.199
this is so stressful

4891.199 --> 4894.4
just the tension that i'm not used to

4893.199 --> 4896.239
being around

4894.4 --> 4897.759999999999
with other flat earthers and nervous

4896.239 --> 4899.759999999999
like what is this

4897.76 --> 4901.76
what does this mean and then afterward i

4899.76 --> 4902.0
got so stressed i knew i felt it coming

4901.76 --> 4904.719
like

4902.0 --> 4905.76
i am going to get big time flu and i did

4904.719 --> 4908.4
like i

4905.76 --> 4908.8
got back home and like within a week i

4908.4 --> 4911.92
got

4908.8 --> 4914.0
really bad flu so yeah

4911.92 --> 4916.08
but that's just directly correlating to

4914.0 --> 4918.08
the stress and i could feel it coming i

4916.08 --> 4919.6
could feel like i'm going to get sick if

4918.08 --> 4922.96
i push myself further

4919.6 --> 4925.84
now it's gonna be even worse

4922.96 --> 4926.639
i knew it i could feel it yeah there

4925.84 --> 4930.96
were times

4926.639 --> 4934.08
where i just sat on the the couch

4930.96 --> 4935.199
like in the evening and you you feel it

4934.08 --> 4937.76
coming right and

4935.199 --> 4938.638999999999
and three hours later you're shivering

4937.76 --> 4941.52
in your bed and

4938.639 --> 4944.639
and you're like done for two days and

4941.52 --> 4945.360000000001
after that you're you're fine again it's

4944.639 --> 4948.719
just

4945.36 --> 4953.04
um the way things

4948.719 --> 4956.2390000000005
work right um and for me i

4953.04 --> 4960.4
and this is anecdotal right um the last

4956.239 --> 4960.4
time i think i would had a flu was

4961.36 --> 4967.759999999999
autumn 2019 i guess

4964.96 --> 4969.28
i don't even know but autumn what that

4967.76 --> 4971.76
yeah 2019

4969.28 --> 4972.639
yeah there was something going on back

4971.76 --> 4975.92
then

4972.639 --> 4976.32
nothing 20 20 nothing right 2020 was

4975.92 --> 4979.28
like

4976.32 --> 4982.719
totally clean but 2019 yeah i think a

4979.28 --> 4986.08
lot of people got really bad flu then

4982.719 --> 4989.44
like in the end in that autumn and early

4986.08 --> 4990.96
winter remember i got really sick and a

4989.44 --> 4992.08
whole lot of other people got really

4990.96 --> 4994.2390000000005
sick it was just

4992.08 --> 4996.0
in the air or something i don't know

4994.239 --> 4998.638999999999
it's a really

4996.0 --> 5000.4
stormy weather with a lot of pressure

4998.639 --> 5003.679
and all that in the air

5000.4 --> 5007.199
heavy winds remember that and yeah when

5003.679 --> 5009.52
nature is like that and persists it

5007.199 --> 5010.799999999999
it typically does spur forth people

5009.52 --> 5014.0
getting more sick

5010.8 --> 5017.4400000000005
than average when there's a lot

5014.0 --> 5019.6
of pressure changes going on in the air

5017.44 --> 5021.36
and it was especially in the december it

5019.6 --> 5022.56
was nuts i remember at the amsterdam

5021.36 --> 5024.639
conference

5022.56 --> 5026.159000000001
like you had to be careful sometimes or

5024.639 --> 5029.84
you would just be blown

5026.159 --> 5032.4
off into the water like

5029.84 --> 5033.360000000001
yeah into the the river there just like

5032.4 --> 5034.799999999999
oh walking around

5033.36 --> 5036.4
trying to have the smoke and then it's

5034.8 --> 5038.320000000001
like oh walk over there and suddenly

5036.4 --> 5040.0
like a wind gust would almost

5038.32 --> 5041.36
blow you into the water if you weren't

5040.0 --> 5043.92
careful because

5041.36 --> 5045.199
yeah lots of heavy pressure heavy

5043.92 --> 5050.2390000000005
pressure winds

5045.199 --> 5050.239
it does typically aggravate

5050.8 --> 5056.08
well the flu expression when it hits you

5054.639 --> 5058.56
that's what i've noticed over my

5056.08 --> 5061.5199999999995
lifetime and heavier the pressure

5058.56 --> 5062.159000000001
the heavier the symptoms you know these

5061.52 --> 5066.080000000001
um

5062.159 --> 5068.0
sayings from the past right when

5066.08 --> 5069.44
your grandma or grandpa would say well

5068.0 --> 5071.12
you have to wear a coat or you get a

5069.44 --> 5074.719
cold right

5071.12 --> 5078.0
this is basically it right

5074.719 --> 5079.76
right it's environmental influence and

5078.0 --> 5082.32
it's a natural process there's no

5079.76 --> 5083.679
invasion there's no invasion happening

5082.32 --> 5086.5599999999995
people there's no micro

5083.679 --> 5087.679
organic thing invading everyone and

5086.56 --> 5091.679
shredding that's

5087.679 --> 5091.679
not how it works at all

5091.76 --> 5096.2390000000005
like i've had situations where people

5094.719 --> 5099.84
were very sick like even

5096.239 --> 5101.759999999999
in this house like last

5099.84 --> 5103.92
this year this summer like one of my

5101.76 --> 5106.639
roommates who eats very unhealthy

5103.92 --> 5108.4800000000005
lots of mcdonald's terrible i don't even

5106.639 --> 5110.56
comment to her about it anyway she knows

5108.48 --> 5112.48
she's [ __ ] herself up with that

5110.56 --> 5114.56
she would get sick really bad did she

5112.48 --> 5116.4
even had covet tests and all that

5114.56 --> 5118.719
at some point never got it officially

5116.4 --> 5122.32
apparently it was false positive

5118.719 --> 5124.4800000000005
and it turned out to be but like yeah

5122.32 --> 5124.88
she would be very sick and snotty and

5124.48 --> 5128.48
[ __ ]

5124.88 --> 5131.6
and yeah i still go in the same shower

5128.48 --> 5133.28
i use the same toilet you know like i

5131.6 --> 5136.2390000000005
didn't get it i didn't get

5133.28 --> 5136.96
anything like not even a sniffle even

5136.239 --> 5139.839999999999
though i was

5136.96 --> 5140.56
in the same place constantly so yeah

5139.84 --> 5143.679
it's not

5140.56 --> 5145.92
infectious it doesn't work that way oh

5143.679 --> 5148.2390000000005
yeah that's that's the whole deal right

5145.92 --> 5149.76
they tell us we need to distance

5148.239 --> 5153.199
ourselves and we need to wear

5149.76 --> 5155.84
masks but when we really look at

5153.199 --> 5156.5599999999995
what's going on in reality i i know

5155.84 --> 5159.360000000001
people

5156.56 --> 5160.56
who got a positive test they only had a

5159.36 --> 5163.5199999999995
sniffle right

5160.56 --> 5164.2390000000005
a small runny nose and a and maybe a

5163.52 --> 5166.88
little bit of

5164.239 --> 5168.718999999999
throat well uh sore throat is usually

5166.88 --> 5171.28
what really says oh then it can be

5168.719 --> 5173.679
corona because it's swollen

5171.28 --> 5175.679
and they had a positive test and those

5173.679 --> 5178.2390000000005
people were married or are married and

5175.679 --> 5181.04
they sleep in the same bed but

5178.239 --> 5181.759999999999
the partner didn't cut it so it's a

5181.04 --> 5184.32
really

5181.76 --> 5185.92
weird situation where they tell us it's

5184.32 --> 5190.159
the most infectious thing

5185.92 --> 5193.6
ever but when i look at my reality

5190.159 --> 5195.599999999999
i don't see this happening right

5193.6 --> 5197.120000000001
and because if it was an actual

5195.6 --> 5199.92
infectious disease then

5197.12 --> 5202.159
literally everyone would get it and

5199.92 --> 5205.28
probably to the same level

5202.159 --> 5207.599999999999
i would expect people in for example

5205.28 --> 5209.04
supermarket falling over right because

5207.6 --> 5212.639
those were open

5209.04 --> 5215.679
the whole year but that didn't happen

5212.639 --> 5218.56
right and not at all so it's

5215.679 --> 5220.0
really the confusion that's going on in

5218.56 --> 5223.6
people's head where they

5220.0 --> 5226.48
on the other side hear about

5223.6 --> 5228.88
people uh about in in the news the

5226.48 --> 5229.678999999999
propaganda about the hospitals and the

5228.88 --> 5232.719
the

5229.679 --> 5234.08
you know that they are full but not

5232.719 --> 5237.52
really you know

5234.08 --> 5238.0
they're completely empty and even in the

5237.52 --> 5240.719
netherlands

5238.0 --> 5242.48
it's been filmed like everywhere that's

5240.719 --> 5245.28
that sort of situation has happened but

5242.48 --> 5248.239
in the netherlands too

5245.28 --> 5249.04
it's just empty hospitals and even like

5248.239 --> 5251.759999999999
people

5249.04 --> 5253.679
that work there nurses complaining like

5251.76 --> 5256.96
this is ridiculous

5253.679 --> 5257.92
it's like we appreciate the the extra

5256.96 --> 5260.96
preparation

5257.92 --> 5262.96
room the the measures for

5260.96 --> 5265.28
if something went would go wrong but

5262.96 --> 5267.28
there's lit it's all empty

5265.28 --> 5269.04
and they would be silenced and they

5267.28 --> 5270.239
would be banned from social media and

5269.04 --> 5273.04
everything

5270.239 --> 5273.839999999999
did you catch that i heard the stories

5273.04 --> 5276.88
yeah i saw

5273.84 --> 5279.4400000000005
people going into hospitals in britain

5276.88 --> 5281.12
and other places that they were like

5279.44 --> 5283.12
well where are other people

5281.12 --> 5285.199
sure then they will tell you yeah well

5283.12 --> 5288.239
they are in the special cove

5285.199 --> 5289.599999999999
wing so of course you won't see it

5288.239 --> 5292.0
the whole but the covenant wing was

5289.6 --> 5292.0
empty

5292.159 --> 5296.159
there's been people sneaking in there

5294.48 --> 5296.959999999999
with their mobiles filming it's like

5296.159 --> 5300.638999999999
it's empty

5296.96 --> 5303.199
there's nothing there yeah

5300.639 --> 5304.56
it's only during flu season when it kind

5303.199 --> 5306.4
of gets filled up

5304.56 --> 5308.159000000001
right because it always gets filled up

5306.4 --> 5311.36
during flu which is normal yeah

5308.159 --> 5314.5599999999995
of course it's normal um again

5311.36 --> 5317.04
going back to history and

5314.56 --> 5318.8
hold on to the pattern keep talking i

5317.04 --> 5320.96
need i need a break

5318.8 --> 5322.0
back two minutes but keep talking i'll

5320.96 --> 5323.6
be back

5322.0 --> 5325.6
okay thanks for watching thanks for

5323.6 --> 5327.1990000000005
doing this with me by the way it's great

5325.6 --> 5329.04
we're going for one and a half hours and

5327.199 --> 5331.599999999999
it's great so thanks really

5329.04 --> 5332.32
for being here i have to go in like 10

5331.6 --> 5335.76
minutes so

5332.32 --> 5336.08
uh but go ahead yeah again looking at

5335.76 --> 5339.04
what

5336.08 --> 5339.36
i observe and what i see in my reality

5339.04 --> 5342.719
is

5339.36 --> 5346.48
is i observe it as a as a pattern so

5342.719 --> 5350.88
you have the the season as a pattern

5346.48 --> 5353.5199999999995
day and night as a pattern uh being born

5350.88 --> 5354.32
growing up and dying is a pattern right

5353.52 --> 5357.6
we see

5354.32 --> 5360.96
every uh everything in our

5357.6 --> 5364.4800000000005
reality as a pattern so why couldn't

5360.96 --> 5367.6
the flu or getting sick in

5364.48 --> 5371.44
preparation of cold and and rain

5367.6 --> 5374.56
and harsh weather also be a pattern

5371.44 --> 5378.239
uh not like it being proposed

5374.56 --> 5381.120000000001
to us as a germ as a virus that

5378.239 --> 5382.4
invades your body but more as your body

5381.12 --> 5387.599999999999
making preparation

5382.4 --> 5390.159
to fi to be sure it can

5387.6 --> 5392.320000000001
go through the seasons as it should

5390.159 --> 5395.12
right just as a healthy

5392.32 --> 5395.12
uh person

5399.6 --> 5406.639
you can discuss you can

5402.639 --> 5410.400000000001
debate about what's real germ theory

5406.639 --> 5410.96
terrain theory what i like to do is just

5410.4 --> 5414.4
observe

5410.96 --> 5417.04
my reality and what i can see and not

5414.4 --> 5419.5199999999995
going off what white lab coats are

5417.04 --> 5423.84
telling me but what i can see

5419.52 --> 5427.280000000001
and um yeah that makes me

5423.84 --> 5430.88
think about these these patterns

5427.28 --> 5434.32
yo i'm back yo

5430.88 --> 5436.8
you still there yeah yeah i have to

5434.32 --> 5438.4
leave in like five or ten minutes oh all

5436.8 --> 5440.96
right

5438.4 --> 5444.08
yeah i see george sanford saying

5440.96 --> 5447.6
something about a pcr test yeah well

5444.08 --> 5448.08
it's it's a it's a weird situation where

5447.6 --> 5451.120000000001
we have

5448.08 --> 5452.48
the maker and creator of this test mr

5451.12 --> 5455.44
carrie mullis who

5452.48 --> 5456.718999999999
got a nobel prize yeah and he said it

5455.44 --> 5460.719
doesn't work

5456.719 --> 5463.44
well he said it's he effectively said

5460.719 --> 5466.4800000000005
it's not a good tool for diagnostics

5463.44 --> 5467.199
because it takes too long right well it

5466.48 --> 5470.239
doesn't

5467.199 --> 5474.08
tell you if you're infectious if you

5470.239 --> 5477.5199999999995
are going to be infectious or if if you

5474.08 --> 5479.5199999999995
uh going to infect somebody or

5477.52 --> 5481.679
you're going to be sick because it only

5479.52 --> 5485.52
focus on a piece of

5481.679 --> 5488.719
rna and then amplifies it

5485.52 --> 5492.4800000000005
it multiplies that piece of rna and then

5488.719 --> 5495.28
it shows you uh the amount of rna

5492.48 --> 5496.4
it doesn't tell you tell you if you are

5495.28 --> 5498.48
going to be sick

5496.4 --> 5499.44
if you are going to be infectious and if

5498.48 --> 5504.32
you're

5499.44 --> 5506.96
uh so there has to be a clinical uh

5504.32 --> 5508.88
picture also made by a doctor so a

5506.96 --> 5512.08
doctor needs to

5508.88 --> 5515.4400000000005
um check you right

5512.08 --> 5518.48
right that that's the definition right

5515.44 --> 5519.5199999999995
general condition analysis and guess why

5518.48 --> 5522.5599999999995
that is

5519.52 --> 5525.4400000000005
because viruses are not infectious

5522.56 --> 5526.719
agents that just oh they're present that

5525.44 --> 5529.678999999999
means

5526.719 --> 5531.679
this is going to happen no it's always

5529.679 --> 5535.36
about the condition of the person and

5531.679 --> 5538.719
the viruses are kind of side effects

5535.36 --> 5541.759999999999
and yeah so you can't really

5538.719 --> 5544.0
test for viruses like that and then have

5541.76 --> 5545.84
perfect predictability over what's going

5544.0 --> 5546.719
to happen because the viruses are not a

5545.84 --> 5550.159000000001
cause they're

5546.719 --> 5552.4
in effect yeah it's ridiculous and

5550.159 --> 5555.44
besides i heard from that test too

5552.4 --> 5558.719
that like to

5555.44 --> 5560.879999999999
properly isolate the right rna takes a

5558.719 --> 5563.04
whole lot of time

5560.88 --> 5565.12
to really do it well it's expensive and

5563.04 --> 5567.12
it takes a lot of time to do it and by

5565.12 --> 5569.92
the time it's properly figured out

5567.12 --> 5572.159
whether it was real or not

5569.92 --> 5574.08
it's it's no longer viable it's no

5572.159 --> 5577.839999999999
longer of use because yeah

5574.08 --> 5580.0
the virus oh that person has a virus oh

5577.84 --> 5581.76
let's check out if it is the right virus

5580.0 --> 5583.92
and it's like a month later i don't know

5581.76 --> 5586.2390000000005
how long it actually takes so i might be

5583.92 --> 5587.1990000000005
getting that wrong and then yeah it's

5586.239 --> 5590.239
already

5587.199 --> 5593.04
hit you know you you can't use virus

5590.239 --> 5595.599999999999
tests like this as some kind of a

5593.04 --> 5601.12
preventative measure

5595.6 --> 5601.120000000001
makes no damn sense even through virus

5601.199 --> 5604.799999999999
when you look at logic timeline um it

5604.0 --> 5607.6
was pretty

5604.8 --> 5608.639
weird timeline right so in december i

5607.6 --> 5612.4800000000005
think was

5608.639 --> 5615.92
end december six chinese

5612.48 --> 5617.12
got ill and they they thought it was a

5615.92 --> 5620.639
virus so they

5617.12 --> 5622.5599999999995
they took they took their uh lung fluid

5620.639 --> 5624.0
if i'm not mistaken and they put it

5622.56 --> 5627.1990000000005
through a machine they

5624.0 --> 5630.32
they said well this is a new virus

5627.199 --> 5633.12
then they send this sequence

5630.32 --> 5636.0
like this is just the code of the

5633.12 --> 5638.719
so-called virus they send it to

5636.0 --> 5639.36
germany through a database so they

5638.719 --> 5644.0
didn't have

5639.36 --> 5644.799999999999
any real-life virus if we assume the

5644.0 --> 5646.48
live fire

5644.8 --> 5649.12
that's already a self contradicting

5646.48 --> 5651.28
statement for a second that it's

5649.12 --> 5652.96
so they didn't have anything to work

5651.28 --> 5656.159
with other than

5652.96 --> 5658.2390000000005
uh bits of code right so it was

5656.159 --> 5659.199
put into a database and then the germans

5658.239 --> 5661.678999999999
took that

5659.199 --> 5664.719
code out of the database and there then

5661.679 --> 5668.56
they made a protocol

5664.719 --> 5672.4
based on this code for the test

5668.56 --> 5675.6
then they submitted this test

5672.4 --> 5679.759999999999
protocol to a journal

5675.6 --> 5683.04
the 21st of january 2020

5679.76 --> 5683.84
and the weirdest thing ever is that it

5683.04 --> 5686.96
was

5683.84 --> 5690.08
peer-reviewed and accepted the next day

5686.96 --> 5692.4800000000005
so within 24 hours this

5690.08 --> 5693.6
protocol paper it's called the corman

5692.48 --> 5696.32
drosten

5693.6 --> 5699.119000000001
paper was was accepted peer-reviewed and

5696.32 --> 5701.44
accepted in the same day so

5699.119 --> 5702.32
when you look yeah when you look at the

5701.44 --> 5705.599999999999
the average

5702.32 --> 5706.159
time of a a paper being peer reviewed

5705.6 --> 5708.6
that

5706.159 --> 5711.04
at this particular journal that that's

5708.6 --> 5713.679
170 days

5711.04 --> 5715.679
that's insane like how can that that how

5713.679 --> 5716.2390000000005
can that even be peer reviewed in that

5715.679 --> 5718.8
time

5716.239 --> 5720.879999999999
that's like that's peer review political

5718.8 --> 5722.0
style like oh yeah we read it all let's

5720.88 --> 5725.52
sign it

5722.0 --> 5726.96
what i talk to uh

5725.52 --> 5729.119000000001
some people about this and they will

5726.96 --> 5732.08
tell you yeah well um

5729.119 --> 5734.239
when i peer review papers it's usually

5732.08 --> 5735.5199999999995
on my desk and it takes a while but if

5734.239 --> 5738.718999999999
it really has a

5735.52 --> 5741.360000000001
a really her it needs to be in a hurry

5738.719 --> 5745.6
yeah sure it can be done in an hour or

5741.36 --> 5747.5199999999995
but yeah it's just a weird situation

5745.6 --> 5751.84
where you have to wonder why

5747.52 --> 5754.080000000001
i mean the why the the hurry why the

5751.84 --> 5756.32
if i do something in a hurry i usually

5754.08 --> 5758.239
[ __ ] it up right

5756.32 --> 5760.88
right make some mistakes but it's not

5758.239 --> 5764.08
even but even calling it a peer review

5760.88 --> 5770.56
is already wrong then because if they

5764.08 --> 5773.6
then called

5770.56 --> 5776.88
hello internet connection issue

5773.6 --> 5777.92
i hope it's ah it's still going okay

5776.88 --> 5781.36
yeah it's still going

5777.92 --> 5782.32
we're fine ah i didn't cut off the

5781.36 --> 5785.5199999999995
stream that's awesome

5782.32 --> 5789.04
it's it's just it's just a weird

5785.52 --> 5790.080000000001
way of working in my opinion right so

5789.04 --> 5792.56
you

5790.08 --> 5793.92
i know they will say well we were in a

5792.56 --> 5797.119000000001
hurry but because this

5793.92 --> 5800.56
is the the most deadliest virus

5797.119 --> 5802.799999999999
of all but no it's not

5800.56 --> 5803.76
we need to have some sort of due

5802.8 --> 5807.52
diligence and

5803.76 --> 5808.08
and again when when i do something in a

5807.52 --> 5813.679
hurry

5808.08 --> 5815.36
i usually make mistakes right

5813.679 --> 5816.96
right that's what i observe yeah but

5815.36 --> 5818.799999999999
even then

5816.96 --> 5821.04
you know if you would if there was some

5818.8 --> 5822.96
kind of urgency to get through it

5821.04 --> 5825.84
quickly

5822.96 --> 5826.8
that could have a good reason you know

5825.84 --> 5830.96
whatever

5826.8 --> 5832.56
but to say oh we are peer reviewing this

5830.96 --> 5834.639
and then rush through it that's just

5832.56 --> 5835.84
wrong that's no that's not how that

5834.639 --> 5837.679
works

5835.84 --> 5839.6
that that makes no sense that's just

5837.679 --> 5840.08
incorrect it's just calling it peer

5839.6 --> 5843.280000000001
review

5840.08 --> 5844.159
it's not because it takes more time to

5843.28 --> 5846.88
do it right

5844.159 --> 5847.759999999999
peer reviewing is all about confirming

5846.88 --> 5850.88
you can't

5847.76 --> 5855.04
rush confirming such things

5850.88 --> 5858.159000000001
it makes no sense yeah

5855.04 --> 5859.199
ridiculous anyway i think you were out

5858.159 --> 5861.839999999999
of time

5859.199 --> 5862.799999999999
yeah yeah i need to i need to all right

5861.84 --> 5865.04
head out

5862.8 --> 5866.56
well thank you roger thank you so much

5865.04 --> 5867.84
for being part of the show today it was

5866.56 --> 5869.119000000001
really great i'm getting a lot of

5867.84 --> 5871.76
compliments from this

5869.119 --> 5873.839999999999
from the chat too so people really

5871.76 --> 5876.56
appreciate you coming on

5873.84 --> 5878.32
uh maybe we should do this more often

5876.56 --> 5878.88
not saying like every week or something

5878.32 --> 5880.96
but

5878.88 --> 5882.639
i'm definitely when there's a dutch

5880.96 --> 5884.8
situation happening

5882.639 --> 5886.2390000000005
i'll think of you and maybe get you oh

5884.8 --> 5887.6
we can talk about we could speculate

5886.239 --> 5890.159
talk about

5887.6 --> 5891.1990000000005
things that that that is on our minds

5890.159 --> 5893.92
and hopefully

5891.199 --> 5895.44
give the audience something to think

5893.92 --> 5898.639
about right because

5895.44 --> 5901.199
yeah we all observe this reality and

5898.639 --> 5903.52
when we hear something that doesn't

5901.199 --> 5906.4
match our reality then we have to

5903.52 --> 5906.8
think about it and and and determine

5906.4 --> 5910.48
well

5906.8 --> 5913.04
what's real what's what's happening here

5910.48 --> 5914.159
right and that's the actual peer

5913.04 --> 5916.719
reviewing

5914.159 --> 5918.879999999999
peer reviewing is about figuring out if

5916.719 --> 5921.92
reality presented is actually

5918.88 --> 5923.36
reality that's really what it's all

5921.92 --> 5926.56
about

5923.36 --> 5929.5199999999995
confirming whether it's real

5926.56 --> 5930.320000000001
right anyway thank you again for coming

5929.52 --> 5932.080000000001
on

5930.32 --> 5933.44
it's been great it's it's been very

5932.08 --> 5936.159
informative

5933.44 --> 5936.5599999999995
and yeah i'm very glad that i did it's

5936.159 --> 5938.96
been

5936.56 --> 5940.639
it's been great having you on and i hope

5938.96 --> 5943.76
to see you around in chat

5940.639 --> 5944.8
and in the future get you on again

5943.76 --> 5948.08
sometime

5944.8 --> 5952.320000000001
by the way do are you active on youtube

5948.08 --> 5954.96
no right i'm i'm mostly in in 24 7

5952.32 --> 5956.719
flat earth discord so shout out right

5954.96 --> 5958.639
your discord

5956.719 --> 5960.4
and i've seen you that's where i've met

5958.639 --> 5963.6
you most of the time

5960.4 --> 5966.0
so right so i like to talk about i'd

5963.6 --> 5969.1990000000005
like to talk to two people and

5966.0 --> 5971.92
uh inform them about uh our reality

5969.199 --> 5973.839999999999
right as we observed it so it's it's fun

5971.92 --> 5977.28
to educate people about

5973.84 --> 5979.119000000001
the nature of our existence right that's

5977.28 --> 5982.159
why i'm usually there

5979.119 --> 5983.92
indeed uh flat earth of course you're

5982.159 --> 5986.96
very much into that too right

5983.92 --> 5991.52
yeah man for how long

5986.96 --> 5991.52
roughly wow um i think it was

5992.239 --> 5998.959999999999
i guess it was early

5995.44 --> 6002.879999999999
2019 early 2019.

5998.96 --> 6006.32
so right so a little over two years

6002.88 --> 6008.8
about yeah all right cool

6006.32 --> 6009.84
well anyway thank you for being there on

6008.8 --> 6012.96

6016.0 --> 6019.6
it's snowing yeah what where it's

6018.0 --> 6022.88

6019.6 --> 6025.04
where is that in the south

6022.88 --> 6025.92
ah right okay it's not snowing over here

6025.04 --> 6028.159
it's look

6025.92 --> 6030.56
it's you know it's just it's just gray

6028.159 --> 6033.5199999999995
and i know it might go in snow

6030.56 --> 6034.320000000001
somewhere later it is the temperature

6033.52 --> 6036.96
though it is

6034.32 --> 6037.759999999999
it is getting cold it usually gets in

6036.96 --> 6039.92
the netherlands

6037.76 --> 6041.360000000001
in my experience gets cold and then

6039.92 --> 6044.56
peaks or

6041.36 --> 6048.32
dips the temperature dips like around

6044.56 --> 6051.52
and january february and then it

6048.32 --> 6052.799999999999
gradually goes back up again so yeah if

6051.52 --> 6056.080000000001
you're already having snow

6052.8 --> 6058.320000000001
wow it should be snowing in a few

6056.08 --> 6059.44
moments at your place i think you're in

6058.32 --> 6062.5599999999995
the middle right

6059.44 --> 6064.879999999999
oh dear it should be

6062.56 --> 6067.1990000000005
i'm looking at the bioradars i hope not

6064.88 --> 6068.96
because i wanted to get groceries before

6067.199 --> 6071.28
that

6068.96 --> 6073.84
so if it can hold off for like another

6071.28 --> 6076.08
hour then i'll be happy

6073.84 --> 6078.159000000001

right so yeah it's been great

6092.56 --> 6096.320000000001
uh i have not been paying too much

6094.4 --> 6098.32
attention to chat

6096.32 --> 6099.759999999999
although there were a couple of trolls

6098.32 --> 6103.36
here earlier but i

6099.76 --> 6106.4800000000005
just banned them all just squirting

6103.36 --> 6108.32
uh yeah i still got another 15 minutes

6106.48 --> 6110.638999999999
to go

6108.32 --> 6120.799999999999
so i'll check out what you guys have

6110.639 --> 6122.95
been saying

6120.8 --> 6124.4800000000005
right

6122.95 --> 6127.679
[Music]

6124.48 --> 6128.32
um ah you guys have been inserting a lot

6127.679 --> 6131.36
of

6128.32 --> 6135.84
good in for info cause there is so much

6131.36 --> 6135.839999999999
info concerning this

6137.679 --> 6142.2390000000005
this supposed virus and it's just it's

6140.4 --> 6145.44
such a mess

6142.239 --> 6146.5599999999995
so many contradictions the things that

6145.44 --> 6150.879999999999
contradict

6146.56 --> 6150.88
the the claims made by governments

6151.199 --> 6156.159
and supposed medical groups that aren't

6153.36 --> 6156.159
really medical

6158.0 --> 6163.36
so yeah it's i'm glad you all enjoyed

6160.84 --> 6165.52
that

6163.36 --> 6167.299999999999
certainly no silent pauses in this show

6165.52 --> 6169.1990000000005
today

6167.3 --> 6171.52
[Music]

6169.199 --> 6173.759999999999
and yeah again thanks roger for coming

6171.52 --> 6175.040000000001
on it's been great i'm very glad i did

6173.76 --> 6177.76
that

6175.04 --> 6178.4
because yeah especially concerning our

6177.76 --> 6180.400000000001
government

6178.4 --> 6182.799999999999
i didn't really need to clear that up

6180.4 --> 6186.32
because i had no idea exactly why and

6182.8 --> 6188.4800000000005
yeah thanks to roger i'm up to date once

6186.32 --> 6192.5599999999995
again

6188.48 --> 6192.5599999999995
about what was going on

6201.119 --> 6205.839999999999
okay terry 306 what

6211.52 --> 6215.4400000000005
people sheeple still accept theory as

6214.4 --> 6217.599999999999
fact

6215.44 --> 6221.36
it's not even a theory it's just it's

6217.6 --> 6222.96
just our story they accept story as fact

6221.36 --> 6226.0
because the theory actually has a

6222.96 --> 6228.0
hypothesis and

6226.0 --> 6229.199
could be considered scientific you have

6228.0 --> 6232.4
something in

6229.199 --> 6234.799999999999
yeah if there's a theory

6232.4 --> 6237.839999999999
then there's something to go by in order

6234.8 --> 6240.08
to test whether something is true or not

6237.84 --> 6242.08
well people aren't getting that they're

6240.08 --> 6242.639
just getting a story and then they just

6242.08 --> 6245.04
have to

6242.639 --> 6246.32
take it they just have to accept it

6245.04 --> 6249.6
that's what

6246.32 --> 6251.599999999999
what they want the propagandist the

6249.6 --> 6253.4400000000005
medical propagandists one they just want

6251.6 --> 6254.320000000001
you to take the story and follow the

6253.44 --> 6256.719
rules

6254.32 --> 6258.239
and don't think about it because when

6256.719 --> 6258.56
you do think about it you figure out

6258.239 --> 6261.5199999999995
that

6258.56 --> 6262.56
every single measure ever associated

6261.52 --> 6264.639
with this

6262.56 --> 6266.2390000000005
this corona situation every single

6264.639 --> 6270.56
measure ever

6266.239 --> 6274.48
is all complete nonsense non-functional

6270.56 --> 6276.4800000000005
from whatever vantage point like whether

6274.48 --> 6278.4
you believe in viruses

6276.48 --> 6280.48
whether you're not believing in viruses

6278.4 --> 6282.5599999999995
and think that terrain theory is a much

6280.48 --> 6285.199
better approach

6282.56 --> 6287.04
it doesn't make any sense the measures

6285.199 --> 6289.5199999999995
don't work by any standard

6287.04 --> 6290.96
it's ridiculous it's all just a game a

6289.52 --> 6294.56
mind control game

6290.96 --> 6296.08
telling you what to do even though

6294.56 --> 6298.56
the reason why you're supposed to be

6296.08 --> 6301.28
doing it has already been proven to

6298.56 --> 6303.6
not be effective in the slightest and if

6301.28 --> 6307.119
anything detrimental

6303.6 --> 6308.400000000001
right and that's where we're at right

6307.119 --> 6310.32
now

6308.4 --> 6311.839999999999
and it's a matter of how long is this

6310.32 --> 6316.5599999999995
going to hold out how long

6311.84 --> 6319.84
is this this big lie going to continue

6316.56 --> 6323.04
before people are actually gonna shut

6319.84 --> 6326.32
their minds to it off

6323.04 --> 6328.56
and just decide no even though we want

6326.32 --> 6332.32
to just blindly follow whatever

6328.56 --> 6333.1990000000005
being told we now have figured out that

6332.32 --> 6335.36
we just

6333.199 --> 6336.799999999999
cannot follow this blindly because it

6335.36 --> 6338.96
makes absolutely no

6336.8 --> 6341.6
sense that's going to take a while

6338.96 --> 6343.52
people are going to have to die

6341.6 --> 6344.639
before it gets to that point because

6343.52 --> 6347.76
some people just

6344.639 --> 6349.4400000000005
don't want to learn they'd rather die

6347.76 --> 6352.159000000001
than let it sink in that they could have

6349.44 --> 6352.159
been lied to

6356.84 --> 6359.84
unfortunately

6362.32 --> 6365.92
and that's why i've said in a

6364.0 --> 6368.56
pessimistic remark

6365.92 --> 6370.2390000000005
that yeah just x amount of people have

6368.56 --> 6372.96
to die from the vaccine

6370.239 --> 6375.678999999999
before it stops it's just they're not

6372.96 --> 6377.92
gonna stop they're just gonna take it

6375.679 --> 6378.719
just gonna take the vaccine no matter

6377.92 --> 6382.8
what and

6378.719 --> 6385.92
die and it's just gonna continue

6382.8 --> 6386.159000000001
until x amount of people have died from

6385.92 --> 6388.639
it

6386.159 --> 6390.0
and then maybe it's going to oh we're

6388.639 --> 6391.04
going to do something else oh it's

6390.0 --> 6394.08
finally cured or

6391.04 --> 6397.44
whatever or oh just forget about it

6394.08 --> 6397.44
let's move on to something next

6398.84 --> 6401.84
right

6404.4 --> 6408.4
all right but anyway i'm not going to be

6406.08 --> 6410.239
one of these people

6408.4 --> 6412.638999999999
definitely not i'm not going to take a

6410.239 --> 6414.48
vaccine no matter what i've already

6412.639 --> 6418.719
declared very early on that

6414.48 --> 6420.48
if if somebody or some group is going to

6418.719 --> 6422.56
attempt to no matter what they are

6420.48 --> 6423.759999999999
corporate government whatever if they're

6422.56 --> 6427.119000000001
going to attempt to

6423.76 --> 6429.84
force it in me i will take it as a

6427.119 --> 6430.239
violent assault on my life and respond

6429.84 --> 6433.92
with

6430.239 --> 6435.599999999999
deadly force specifically deadly as in

6433.92 --> 6436.159
i'm not gonna wound you to stop you i'm

6435.6 --> 6438.639
going to

6436.159 --> 6439.44
kill you if you try to do that just so

6438.639 --> 6441.84
you know

6439.44 --> 6443.199
but i'm not going to be deluded in that

6441.84 --> 6446.639
it's happening until

6443.199 --> 6448.96
it is really there like they can

6446.639 --> 6450.08
say you must take it or you have no

6448.96 --> 6452.88
choice that's

6450.08 --> 6453.679
all potentially bluff it becomes real

6452.88 --> 6457.679
when they come

6453.679 --> 6460.159
at your door with the supposed doctor

6457.679 --> 6460.719
and cops and they have the needles ready

6460.159 --> 6462.638999999999
that's

6460.719 --> 6465.199
when [ __ ] gets real and that's when

6462.639 --> 6467.04
people will die one way or the other

6465.199 --> 6468.638999999999
but i don't think that that point is

6467.04 --> 6471.36
even gonna arrive at any time

6468.639 --> 6472.96
it's just a it's a giant bluff it's all

6471.36 --> 6476.719
a giant bluff

6472.96 --> 6479.84
making you do it making you go with it

6476.719 --> 6482.56
for any reason because you love

6479.84 --> 6484.4800000000005
everybody so much because you can't

6482.56 --> 6488.320000000001
handle the truth

6484.48 --> 6490.159
or whatever reason

6488.32 --> 6491.36
because there's some advantage because

6490.159 --> 6494.5599999999995
you think you can

6491.36 --> 6498.639
make easier go around with your business

6494.56 --> 6502.4800000000005
any reason that you have to engage

6498.639 --> 6506.400000000001
in wanting to take that vaccine

6502.48 --> 6508.4
because once these groups these

6506.4 --> 6510.5599999999995
controllers the government

6508.4 --> 6512.08
and the corporate once they actually

6510.56 --> 6515.280000000001
start to force it on people

6512.08 --> 6516.719
that's when a certain level of spirit is

6515.28 --> 6518.639
broken

6516.719 --> 6520.4
social contracts become broken on a

6518.639 --> 6523.84
whole new level

6520.4 --> 6526.5599999999995
and that also typically causes people

6523.84 --> 6528.32
to snap out of their dream world in

6526.56 --> 6529.04
which they currently still reside and

6528.32 --> 6532.32
they're kind of

6529.04 --> 6534.639
seemingly seem to count on people

6532.32 --> 6536.4
still sticking to their dream world in

6534.639 --> 6537.52
order to from that dream world

6536.4 --> 6541.92
perspective

6537.52 --> 6545.119000000001
get caught up get an injection and die

6541.92 --> 6547.119
so if they try to force it

6545.119 --> 6549.28
then suddenly there's a big chance that

6547.119 --> 6551.759999999999
a whole bunch of people maybe

6549.28 --> 6553.28
everyone will completely snap out of it

6551.76 --> 6554.96
and then approach everything completely

6553.28 --> 6556.719
different and it will be seen as a

6554.96 --> 6559.679
medical tyranny then

6556.719 --> 6561.119
as a serious dictatorial situation very

6559.679 --> 6565.92
serious

6561.119 --> 6568.719
because you can't force anybody

6565.92 --> 6570.4
onto something medical you can't do that

6568.719 --> 6573.28
that's

6570.4 --> 6573.759999999999
that's been forbidden on a very wide

6573.28 --> 6577.5199999999995
scale

6573.76 --> 6580.400000000001
since well since the nazi age like

6577.52 --> 6582.4800000000005
you can't force that on anyone you can

6580.4 --> 6584.5599999999995
make it highly suggestible you can make

6582.48 --> 6586.879999999999
it profitable you can

6584.56 --> 6587.76
manipulate somebody into wanting it and

6586.88 --> 6591.679
taking it

6587.76 --> 6594.719
but you can't force it

6591.679 --> 6597.28
not really that's a whole nother level

6594.719 --> 6599.28
of tyranny that that i don't think that

6597.28 --> 6600.159
the controllers and the system how it

6599.28 --> 6603.44
works right now

6600.159 --> 6605.36
can handle that it can't handle that

6603.44 --> 6606.719
too many people will snap out of their

6605.36 --> 6611.36
dream and

6606.719 --> 6614.56
just yeah

6611.36 --> 6615.5199999999995
take their easy control tools and mind

6614.56 --> 6618.080000000001
control tools

6615.52 --> 6618.080000000001
from them

6618.8 --> 6625.84
all right

6636.84 --> 6653.84
do

6639.599 --> 6653.84
yeah the word jab is terrible

6667.28 --> 6670.96
yeah they might have just they might

6669.28 --> 6674.159
just as well call the

6670.96 --> 6676.639
jab just a shiv it's just you're being

6674.159 --> 6676.638999999999
stabbed

6677.04 --> 6681.84
being stabbed with poison

6684.159 --> 6687.598999999999
like why do you call it a jab you could

6686.0 --> 6690.08
just call it a shiv

6687.599 --> 6690.88
you know what's the difference except

6690.08 --> 6695.84
that shift

6690.88 --> 6695.84
usually doesn't contain poison in it

6720.84 --> 6723.84
ah

6726.159 --> 6731.799999999999
right isn't it random

6728.62 --> 6731.8
[Music]

6734.239 --> 6738.638999999999
isn't that just kind of an uncanny

6736.96 --> 6741.04
resemblance

6738.639 --> 6744.32
might as just as well call it a shiv

6741.04 --> 6748.719
it's like oh i'm getting my shift today

6744.32 --> 6748.719
has your baby gotten the shiv yet

6748.84 --> 6751.84
right

6752.0 --> 6755.159
[Music]

6757.67 --> 6761.689
[Music]

6770.639 --> 6774.2390000000005
yeah with a makeshift weapon that's

6776.84 --> 6779.84
right

6801.04 --> 6807.679
yeah like even like to me i the idea of

6804.719 --> 6811.04
vaccines repulses me so much

6807.679 --> 6814.0
by now that like i don't see it very

6811.04 --> 6817.84
much different from just

6814.0 --> 6822.48
i don't know taking a what is there

6817.84 --> 6822.96
a syringe and just absorbing sewer water

6822.48 --> 6825.04
and just

6822.96 --> 6827.52
squirting it in somebody's arm like that

6825.04 --> 6830.08
it's like how much of a difference is it

6827.52 --> 6830.080000000001
at this point

6830.8 --> 6837.52
how much of a difference is it

6834.239 --> 6838.638999999999
just shove disgusting garbage in your

6837.52 --> 6840.8
arm

6838.639 --> 6842.32
poison yourself it's just like okay just

6840.8 --> 6849.84
poison yourself

6842.32 --> 6849.84
like why why do people do this

6855.44 --> 6862.5599999999995
okay dorian gray i don't know about that

6859.44 --> 6865.119
i think polio is real but

6862.56 --> 6867.92
i'm not saying that you should then take

6865.119 --> 6870.239
a polio vaccine

6867.92 --> 6870.2390000000005
you know

6873.36 --> 6877.679
because as far as i've heard the polio

6875.599 --> 6879.28
vaccine actually typically oh there it's

6877.679 --> 6882.639
snowing

6879.28 --> 6882.639
it is snowing [ __ ]

6883.119 --> 6888.639
hmm it's very light snow though

6888.96 --> 6894.0
huh you can't even see it i think

6892.48 --> 6896.0
let me try i don't know if you can see

6894.0 --> 6899.76
this it's just very

6896.0 --> 6899.76
light snowflakes flying around

6900.48 --> 6908.08
you probably can't really see it

6905.199 --> 6910.799999999999
yeah but it does seem to be snowing

6908.08 --> 6910.8
right here now

6913.84 --> 6917.360000000001
anyway i think i'm gonna round out the

6915.76 --> 6922.08
show definitely

6917.36 --> 6922.08
managed to fill up these uh two hours

6922.239 --> 6928.159
snow only works on the polars

6925.52 --> 6931.360000000001
okay that's hilarious minded god

6928.159 --> 6933.92
disagreed by the way

6931.36 --> 6934.799999999999
pretty sure that any sort of thing only

6933.92 --> 6936.88
works on a

6934.8 --> 6938.88
closed system where there is a stable

6936.88 --> 6942.96
air pressure so that things can

6938.88 --> 6947.28
actually crystallize and all that and

6942.96 --> 6950.719
have turbulence and all that

6947.28 --> 6951.599
like yeah you need a closed system to

6950.719 --> 6954.96
have

6951.599 --> 6958.96
anything at all gas rain

6954.96 --> 6962.08
snow dust

6958.96 --> 6963.679
flying around no requires gas pressure

6962.08 --> 6966.239
and the gas pressure requires a

6963.679 --> 6966.2390000000005
container

6967.119 --> 6973.44
anyway so thanks everyone for coming
