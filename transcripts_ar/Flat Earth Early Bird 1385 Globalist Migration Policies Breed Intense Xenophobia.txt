418.919 --> 423.84
in the comment section

421.199 --> 425.58000000000004
a lot of flat earthers out there just to

423.84 --> 428.4
shut it off

425.58 --> 431.9
and I I get it more and more why I just

428.4 --> 431.9
I don't want that

basically cyber stalking me through this

440.46 --> 444.23999999999995
[ __ ]

441.419 --> 448.639

444.24 --> 448.639
just to be rid of it not doing it

451.259 --> 456.96000000000004

453.78 --> 460.149
by well leaving comments too

[Music]

462.599 --> 466.74

really get a lot of comments in general

466.74 --> 471.66

469.139 --> 475.039
freaking day some days it's really not

471.66 --> 475.03900000000004
that event for others

475.259 --> 481.16

515.76 --> 519.779

517.56 --> 521.959

just gotta tell it how it is even if

543.36 --> 550.14

I don't know why right there's a lot of

584.519 --> 590.82
people out there that are really puzzled

586.38 --> 593.279
as to why can Arwin just say everything

590.82 --> 597.2
and other people get kicked off YouTube

593.279 --> 597.2

597.839 --> 601.6400000000001

when I eat something on the show what is

1275.419 --> 1277.6000000000001
that

1277.94 --> 1283.0
one thing

1280.34 --> 1283.0
yeah

1287.299 --> 1290.86
I'm gonna get the [ __ ] out of here

[ __ ] disgusting Stars you want to be

1323.48 --> 1331.34
victim narrative scumbag trolls and that

1326.72 --> 1333.799
is really dumb [ __ ] people that don't

1331.34 --> 1336.1589999999999
even know how many fingers they have on

1333.799 --> 1336.1589999999999
their hand

1348.679 --> 1353.1190000000001

attained the answer exactly as I

1362.299 --> 1367.4
instructed you and you didn't and

instead you gave the dumbest [ __ ]

1383.659 --> 1390.0390000000002
to say pizza is the dumbest answer you

[Music]

1395.62 --> 1399.86
who cares I care

1398.12 --> 1402.08
because I don't want people that are

absolute retards and that can barely

1402.08 --> 1406.059
even count their own fingers

1407.48 --> 1411.32
yeah

1409.039 --> 1414.32
if you're a [ __ ] and you think you can

1411.32 --> 1417.08
just come strolling in here and be a

[ __ ] in school you can get the [ __ ]

1417.08 --> 1422.24
out

1419.0 --> 1423.86
this place is for paying attention and

1422.24 --> 1426.86
if you don't

1423.86 --> 1430.1589999999999
you're below the trolls

1426.86 --> 1433.2199999999998
because trolls are [ __ ] scumbags but

1430.159 --> 1436.1200000000001
at least they have some measure of

1433.22 --> 1436.1200000000001
attention span

1439.94 --> 1444.2
there you go dank

1442.039 --> 1446.419
yeah I know but that's why you got a

1444.2 --> 1449.48
wrench

1446.419 --> 1452.419
but indeed illuminatios are it is as

1449.48 --> 1455.059
always that's what it always is

1452.419 --> 1458.539
one thing that I've ever eaten on this

1455.059 --> 1462.28
show is Illuminati Casa never anything

1458.539 --> 1462.28
else not even once

1466.659 --> 1471.46
held up to Maya indeed that's a

1469.159 --> 1474.5990000000002
tradition that I created

1471.46 --> 1474.599
[Music]

1477.5 --> 1482.0
you could by the way also think it of a

1479.9 --> 1484.46
a PR a pastry

1482.0 --> 1486.02
stealth fighter it kind of does look

1484.46 --> 1487.94
like that

1486.02 --> 1489.74
oh it doesn't anymore now that I've

1487.94 --> 1492.26
taken a bite out of it but it really

1489.74 --> 1494.6
does have that triangle shape with often

1492.26 --> 1498.64
like a little bulge in the back

1494.6 --> 1498.6399999999999
it just looks like a stealth fighter

1499.58 --> 1503.32
like one of those from the 90s

1506.0 --> 1510.559
those that like bleed when they're on

1508.46 --> 1513.26
the ground and they only stop bleeding

1510.559 --> 1515.72
when they actually go super high speed

1513.26 --> 1521.12
weird things

1515.72 --> 1525.159
right you did have an apple once did I

1521.12 --> 1525.1589999999999
really on the show

1526.34 --> 1528.9399999999998
what

1529.94 --> 1532.659
hmm

1534.98 --> 1539.659
oh [ __ ] okay well I guess

1538.34 --> 1542.36
that

1539.659 --> 1545.419
only a thing I've ever eaten ever oh

1542.36 --> 1547.82
[ __ ] and of course blueberries ah

1545.419 --> 1552.4
yeah okay

1547.82 --> 1552.3999999999999
let me rephrase that the only

1552.88 --> 1559.0390000000002
non-fruit thing that I've ever eaten on

1555.32 --> 1560.84
the show is an Illuminati croissant

1559.039 --> 1565.1589999999999
yeah

1560.84 --> 1567.6399999999999
But to answer Pizza is just too [ __ ]

1565.159 --> 1567.64
so

1571.7 --> 1575.659
ASMR esquee

1575.84 --> 1578.26
what

1579.2 --> 1582.76
low laser lie

1590.36 --> 1595.82
right but to answer oh what are you

1593.12 --> 1600.1
reading is it pizza yeah that's just too

1595.82 --> 1600.1
[ __ ] dumb I mean serious

1601.4 --> 1606.3200000000002
or maybe the man from SC never actually

1604.039 --> 1608.9
watched my show maybe just likes to pop

1606.32 --> 1611.299
by a live stream that has Flat Earth in

1608.9 --> 1613.039
it say something and then just go away

1611.299 --> 1615.98
and he literally doesn't know anything

1613.039 --> 1618.4
about my show at all that could be the

1615.98 --> 1618.4
case too

1620.24 --> 1622.84
foreign

1624.46 --> 1629.0
ERS I don't know if I do

1627.02 --> 1632.179
I think that's more reserved for the

1629.0 --> 1636.38
Flat Earth debate team I mean they

1632.179 --> 1639.38
like Brian for example Brian's logic I

1636.38 --> 1643.779
mean that guy like actually could like

1639.38 --> 1643.779
run a baller tier business

1644.9 --> 1649.4
I'm seriously he could literally just

1647.36 --> 1651.76
bottle and sell it on the Flat Earth

1649.4 --> 1651.76
Market

1654.62 --> 1658.76
and of course Nathan but yeah I think

1656.779 --> 1661.299
Nathan just really likes guzzling it

1658.76 --> 1661.299
himself

1667.12 --> 1673.58

1670.179 --> 1675.3200000000002

1673.58 --> 1677.24
know

1675.32 --> 1679.4189999999999
but he hasn't been doing the show this

1677.24 --> 1679.419

1693.799 --> 1698.299
yeah no but when it comes to Ballers I

1696.26 --> 1700.1589999999999
don't really like drinking their tear I

1698.299 --> 1702.1399999999999
don't like making Ballers miserable I

1700.159 --> 1705.2
have a baller inside of me too it's

1702.14 --> 1707.419
called Ballwin I don't like it

1705.2 --> 1708.5
what I do like is putting them in their

1707.419 --> 1711.44
place

1708.5 --> 1714.08
making them realize hey you're a [ __ ]

1711.44 --> 1717.3200000000002

1714.08 --> 1722.6
I outrank you spiritually

1717.32 --> 1727.1589999999999
I can manage your dream that you use as

1722.6 --> 1730.279
a luxury of Western Society yeah

1727.159 --> 1734.1200000000001
I provide you

1730.279 --> 1737.12
partially with dream consistency so that

1734.12 --> 1739.76
you don't have to get out

1737.12 --> 1743.6589999999999
so I prefer to just put them in their

1739.76 --> 1746.32
place I don't like them miserable I

1743.659 --> 1746.3200000000002
don't like it

1746.539 --> 1749.08
foreign

1749.799 --> 1754.46
secretly I know it's all fake but I like

1752.9 --> 1756.799
it

1754.46 --> 1760.1000000000001
I like to dream about space and science

1756.799 --> 1762.32
fiction stuff I love it I have like a

1760.1 --> 1765.1999999999998
whole visual library in me and

1762.32 --> 1767.899
it's like a living movie I'll always

1765.2 --> 1771.26
have that why would I now destroy that

1767.899 --> 1773.779
and all the capabilities it has I don't

1771.26 --> 1776.419
I don't wanna

1773.779 --> 1779.0
but I will what I will not do is try to

1776.419 --> 1781.88
fool people

1779.0 --> 1784.039
in that it's actually a globe

1781.88 --> 1785.8400000000001
if I'm going to be fooling then I'm

1784.039 --> 1786.98
gonna make it very clear that I'm

1785.84 --> 1789.62
fooling

1786.98 --> 1793.3990000000001
that's why I always carefully premise

1789.62 --> 1796.9599999999998
when I start talking about something

1793.399 --> 1796.9599999999998
ball earth related

1797.899 --> 1803.1789999999999
I always premise it very carefully

1799.64 --> 1806.24
because I don't want baller tears

1803.179 --> 1809.96
I want them to just realize I outrank

1806.24 --> 1813.5
you I am better at it you think you got

1809.96 --> 1817.52
all the math and all the tricks but I am

1813.5 --> 1821.96
actually in the class of Designing the

well Neil I I think that Nathan was

2719.859 --> 2723.46
actually gonna do a members only stream

2721.78 --> 2725.8590000000004
today I don't know if he's actually

2723.46 --> 2728.859
having a panel about it

2725.859 --> 2732.06
you might just not it might be like a

2728.859 --> 2732.06

hey Neil have you ever considered that

2816.819 --> 2822.16
maybe

2817.98 --> 2824.76
maybe just maybe you could do a stream

2822.16 --> 2824.7599999999998
yourself

2827.56 --> 2831.18
have you ever thought of that

2836.319 --> 2839.8
what do you mean you can

2838.24 --> 2842.14
yeah it's not gonna be flat Earth

2839.8 --> 2845.6800000000003

2895.78 --> 2903.2200000000003
I have that effect too it's just that

2898.66 --> 2905.44
beside that I also have my own show so

2903.22 --> 2908.02
I'm not fully dependent on that

or are you just gonna settle for chat

3003.9 --> 3009.859

says that

I'm sure it will be but he I mean he

3015.48 --> 3020.54

3067.14 --> 3071.24
hello Professor Phil bill

3075.18 --> 3079.6189999999997
no he's not gonna spill the beans about

3077.88 --> 3081.359
what's going on with Nate dude he

3079.619 --> 3085.099
doesn't even know what's going on with

3081.359 --> 3085.0989999999997
Nathan that's why he's so frustrated

3085.26 --> 3090.1800000000003
and technically neither do I although

3091.619 --> 3098.6400000000003
the problem with me is

3095.16 --> 3101.2799999999997
you can't really hide things from me so

3098.64 --> 3103.0789999999997
I have a very strong suspicion that's

3101.28 --> 3105.6600000000003
probably gonna turn out to be right as

3103.079 --> 3109.5
to what he's doing right now

3105.66 --> 3113.42
what I was told to not talk about it

3109.5 --> 3113.42
which is very annoying to me

3115.02 --> 3120.42
I mean that's like an Indecent Proposal

but to me

3120.42 --> 3123.2000000000003
but whatever

3123.359 --> 3126.5
that means his show

3129.0 --> 3135.48

3132.599 --> 3138.54
noise knows okay Nathan didn't tell

3135.48 --> 3140.819
anybody he's still not telling he's just

3138.54 --> 3144.3
not saying what he's doing he's not

3140.819 --> 3147.54
telling at all to No One not in the chat

3144.3 --> 3150.8
not in the Skype call nowhere we don't

nobody shot him down

what the hell are you blabbering about

3197.819 --> 3205.2
I mean the only way I could even imagine

3201.8 --> 3209.6600000000003
remotely Neil or Nathan could be shut

3205.2 --> 3214.02
down is if he was like literally bribed

3209.66 --> 3216.72
by the government like okay if you stop

3214.02 --> 3220.14
doing a show we're gonna give you five

3216.72 --> 3221.8799999999997

never do a show

3223.92 --> 3228.3
you do it ever again that's like the

3225.839 --> 3230.2799999999997
only way I could ever imagine that it

3228.3 --> 3232.7400000000002
would even be possible to make him stop

3230.28 --> 3236.0400000000004
other than severe health issues or

3232.74 --> 3238.5
something so ridiculous

3236.04 --> 3241.2
the Channel's still there he doesn't

3238.5 --> 3243.3
have a strike

3241.2 --> 3247.7
it's all right there

3243.3 --> 3247.7000000000003
he's still doing premieres

3247.859 --> 3255.54
and he's gonna do a members only stream

3251.64 --> 3258.18
so no nobody shot him down don't be

3255.54 --> 3260.579
ridiculous Neil

3258.18 --> 3264.18
oh you're saying what you're hearing

3260.579 --> 3267.42
through the internet oh yes oh those are

3264.18 --> 3269.7599999999998
always such good leads aren't they Neil

3267.42 --> 3274.02
you dumbass

3275.339 --> 3281.2799999999997

be guaranteed to be 180 degree

importantly when you hear that [ __ ]

3290.099 --> 3295.079
you basically gotta come to the

conclusion it's going to be exactly the

opposite of everything they say because

3297.599 --> 3304.2200000000003

remember was it like Lord Oakley or

something there was actually somebody

3342.96 --> 3348.68
like that in England

3344.88 --> 3348.6800000000003
maybe he's got his title back

3348.72 --> 3353.359
but Lord

3350.119 --> 3357.3

I have no problem with the chat yeah but

3549.0 --> 3553.859
you have a problem with these disgusting

3560.16 --> 3565.3799999999997
your way out of this Neil you always get

3562.68 --> 3568.02
agitated by them

3565.38 --> 3571.619
we have to literally hear you talk about

3568.02 --> 3574.38
it on a weekly basis and it's okay we

3571.619 --> 3577.819
get that about you but you do

3574.38 --> 3577.819
you absolutely do

3593.28 --> 3598.1400000000003
okay fine you heard yeah I'm not talking

3595.859 --> 3599.7599999999998
about what you meant in the moment I'm

3598.14 --> 3603.299
not talking about what you even said

3599.76 --> 3605.4
anymore Neil just talking about you

3603.299 --> 3607.559
what to do

3605.4 --> 3609.359
because what you say isn't always a

3607.559 --> 3611.7000000000003
proper translation of what's actually

3609.359 --> 3613.38
going on this idea not because of

3611.7 --> 3614.819
Nefarious reasons because you want to

3613.38 --> 3616.1400000000003
hide it but because you're just kind of

3614.819 --> 3620.359
sloppy with it

3616.14 --> 3620.359
that's fine it's party yeah

information about how the public has

4140.54 --> 4144.62
literally been ordered

4142.4 --> 4145.639999999999

4144.62 --> 4147.339
been

well

4147.339 --> 4152.719

every single aspect of its all on

purpose it's a deliberate attempt at

4527.84 --> 4532.04

yeah because these people are not gonna

4532.04 --> 4536.08

literally taking the trash out of third

4548.36 --> 4554.719
world countries and then shoving him in

your backyard on purpose and spoiling

4554.719 --> 4560.3
them on top of it to make it as

4557.36 --> 4563.96
disastrous as humanly possible

4560.3 --> 4567.4400000000005
they want everything to be destroyed by

4563.96 --> 4567.44
doing that specifically

4568.1 --> 4571.9400000000005
and they're doing it here too in the air

4570.08 --> 4574.88
we don't have this luxury out there we

4571.94 --> 4575.96
got a freaking Cruiser like a cruise

4574.88 --> 4579.02

4579.02 --> 4584.26
over here in the Netherlands

4580.82 --> 4584.259999999999

4600.62 --> 4604.599999999999
for doing absolutely nothing

4604.76 --> 4609.08

4606.739 --> 4611.178999999999

4638.26 --> 4643.04

4643.04 --> 4648.86
stupid [ __ ] immigrants they

4646.04 --> 4650.6
I mean if I was a [ __ ] immigrated in a

piece of [ __ ] country and nobody wanted

4650.6 --> 4654.7390000000005
me it's probably not even a piece of

4653.0 --> 4655.94
[ __ ] country it's mostly just being a

4654.739 --> 4658.759999999999
piece of [ __ ]

4655.94 --> 4659.78
and like some Western Country would say

4658.76 --> 4662.54
like hey

4659.78 --> 4664.46
we want to live like a Kang

4662.54 --> 4668.44
come over here we'll give you everything

4664.46 --> 4670.46
I mean why the [ __ ] wouldn't you do that

4668.44 --> 4671.239
seriously why the [ __ ] wouldn't you do

4670.46 --> 4674.42
that

4671.239 --> 4676.159
you can't blame those people it's the

4674.42 --> 4679.1
[ __ ] pieces of [ __ ] in government

4676.159 --> 4682.639999999999
that have organized this organized it

4679.1 --> 4685.46
specifically to destroy the nation

4682.64 --> 4686.780000000001
that's the problem and those people need

4685.46 --> 4688.94
to burn

4686.78 --> 4690.86
just send those stupid immigrants back

4688.94 --> 4692.54
just put them in the standard waiting

4690.86 --> 4694.099999999999
row though you really want to become a

4692.54 --> 4695.84
part of this country or you're gonna

4694.1 --> 4700.6
have to learn a few things and if you

4695.84 --> 4700.6
can't we'll send you back that simple

4704.3 --> 4708.860000000001
but the way they're doing it now is

4706.76 --> 4711.88
monstrous

4708.86 --> 4714.86
they're literally just

4711.88 --> 4717.5
anti-nation this is not no Nationals

4714.86 --> 4720.199
this anti-nationalism they destroy

4717.5 --> 4723.62
National cohesion by taking a bunch of

4720.199 --> 4725.9
uneducated foreigners

4723.62 --> 4727.28
that are being puked out of their own

4725.9 --> 4730.42
countries

4727.28 --> 4733.759999999999
and then just spoiling them like kings

4730.42 --> 4735.8
in the midst of like a financial crisis

4733.76 --> 4740.02
where people can't even freaking pay

4735.8 --> 4740.02
their own electricity bill okay

4740.26 --> 4746.5
it's mon-stress and it's on purpose and

4744.02 --> 4752.179
these people that are organizing this

4746.5 --> 4754.82
deserve to die horribly on pious

4752.179 --> 4756.26
hearing their screams

4754.82 --> 4759.86
of hell

4756.26 --> 4763.820000000001
as they slowly burn up and fill the air

4759.86 --> 4766.4
with a pig bacon smell

4763.82 --> 4771.739
they deserve it I want to see it happen

4766.4 --> 4771.739
I want to see them die horrifically

4772.39 --> 4775.579000000001
[Music]

4776.679 --> 4782.08
no it's not about people getting free

4779.179 --> 4784.6990000000005
money it's about

4782.08 --> 4787.699
Outsiders that have nothing to do with

4784.699 --> 4791.719
us being spoiled

4787.699 --> 4795.5
while literally the people here that are

4791.719 --> 4799.28
born and raised here are starving and

4795.5 --> 4801.199
dying from the cold okay it's not about

4799.28 --> 4803.84
the free money it's about who's getting

4801.199 --> 4804.739
it and why and what are they doing with

4803.84 --> 4807.88
it

4804.739 --> 4807.879999999999
that's the problem

4817.719 --> 4822.199
doesn't like country taking care of

4819.86 --> 4824.12
other countries people well that's not

4822.199 --> 4826.5199999999995
even it Godzilla

4824.12 --> 4829.28
that's not even it

4826.52 --> 4832.3
did you know that especially like 90s

4829.28 --> 4836.239
and 80s the Netherlands has always been

4832.3 --> 4838.6990000000005
extremely helpful extremely helpful to

4836.239 --> 4840.32
other countries and to poor people in

4838.699 --> 4844.4
other countries

4840.32 --> 4847.46
I don't have an objection to that

4844.4 --> 4850.82
that's not the problem I mean it can be

4847.46 --> 4852.199
I mean it like if it did just over

4850.82 --> 4855.92
extend

4852.199 --> 4858.379999999999
right but it is like an investment in

4855.92 --> 4860.12
people when you do that it is good for

4858.38 --> 4862.76
the world when you do that

4860.12 --> 4865.48
unless you politicize them and turn them

4862.76 --> 4868.58
into sjws that then destroy everything

4865.48 --> 4870.08
yeah that is exactly the opposite as

4868.58 --> 4871.4
long as that doesn't happen it's just

4870.08 --> 4874.04
normal

4871.4 --> 4876.139999999999
a normal help

4874.04 --> 4877.76
that's good I like that about the

4876.14 --> 4880.219
Netherlands I like that the Netherlands

4877.76 --> 4883.360000000001
actually helps other countries too

4880.219 --> 4887.54
what I don't like is that they

4883.36 --> 4889.239
prioritize helping other countries over

4887.54 --> 4893.739
our own

4889.239 --> 4893.739
that is the problem

4894.44 --> 4902.48
we need to be helped first

4898.04 --> 4905.48
and can make our country great again

4902.48 --> 4908.0
and effectively stabilize it get

4905.48 --> 4911.5
everybody just building on the future

4908.0 --> 4911.5
again get it rolling again

4911.6 --> 4918.1990000000005
strengthen our strengths and then with

4914.659 --> 4921.86
that power that we can't just build

4918.199 --> 4923.839999999999
in our nation then it's much easier to

4921.86 --> 4925.94
actually start helping other countries

4923.84 --> 4929.900000000001
again like we used to

4925.94 --> 4934.879999999999
that's what I want I want my country to

4929.9 --> 4937.699
be fixed first and then when we do that

4934.88 --> 4939.1990000000005
then we can help other countries and

4937.699 --> 4941.9
other people again

4939.199 --> 4945.32
but we got to start here or it's just

4941.9 --> 4948.199
gonna collapse so terribly so terribly

4945.32 --> 4950.299999999999
there will be a backlash where the Dutch

4948.199 --> 4953.0599999999995
people if if this carries on is not

4950.3 --> 4955.28
stuck the Dutch people on average will

4953.06 --> 4957.7390000000005
start to hate

4955.28 --> 4960.199
hate foreigners

4957.739 --> 4963.5599999999995
yeah we're not like that we'd never were

4960.199 --> 4966.919999999999
like that we will be made to hate

4963.56 --> 4969.620000000001
foreigners to become actually bigoted

4966.92 --> 4972.62
and like yeah just kill them

4969.62 --> 4974.719
we don't give a [ __ ] my country my

4972.62 --> 4977.84
country first kill them I don't care for

4974.719 --> 4979.94
[ __ ] about other people that's what they

4977.84 --> 4984.1990000000005
are causing with this that's what they

4979.94 --> 4986.48
are breeding in our souls by doing this

4984.199 --> 4989.659
it's terrible

4986.48 --> 4992.299999999999
it is evil beyond measure and they

4989.659 --> 4998.44
should all burn

5020.8 --> 5026.92
stopped with force from the inside after

5024.4 --> 5029.5599999999995
that's over then we will have no more

5026.92 --> 5033.9
Good Will and we will be

5029.56 --> 5037.42
forged into a hate for the outside world

5033.9 --> 5039.5199999999995
that will be unrelenting

5037.42 --> 5043.3
that's what they're creating with this

5039.52 --> 5048.280000000001
with these policies the hatred for the

5043.3 --> 5051.76
outside it is breeding xenophobia these

5048.28 --> 5054.759999999999
policies of forcing migrants Upon Us in

5051.76 --> 5057.9400000000005
times of Crisis Financial Calamity and

5054.76 --> 5059.6990000000005
then spoiling them all in our faces is

5057.94 --> 5063.699
breeding

5059.699 --> 5065.259999999999
xenophobia I swear it I guarantee it Our

listen to me listen to me carefully

5067.9 --> 5074.92
about this this is a prediction it will

5071.44 --> 5076.62
come true I will bet my freaking life on

5074.92 --> 5079.54
it

5076.62 --> 5082.48
this type of action from governments

5079.54 --> 5085.12
with immigration policy breeds

5082.48 --> 5086.98
xenophobia

5085.12 --> 5089.38
is that what you want

5086.98 --> 5091.718999999999
is that what you want people

5089.38 --> 5094.06
because that's what's going to happen if

5091.719 --> 5096.88
you let this carry on it's going to

5094.06 --> 5099.9400000000005
breed xenophobia yeah

5096.88 --> 5101.8
your own kids will grow up to hate

5099.94 --> 5104.5
foreigners

5101.8 --> 5106.900000000001
to hate them they might even hate them

5104.5 --> 5109.0
to the extent that they might become

5106.9 --> 5111.879999999999
militant about them and then you'll have

5109.0 --> 5114.34
freaking Grassroots Nazis on your hand

5111.88 --> 5118.32

you didn't do anything about it

5132.179 --> 5135.719
attention to that

5138.46 --> 5145.719
yeah

5140.219 --> 5145.719
globalism breeds xenophobia

5148.48 --> 5153.099999999999
that's gonna be the title for my show

5184.06 --> 5187.4800000000005
migrants

5185.92 --> 5190.54
I don't know

5187.48 --> 5193.12
just put them in a Asylum Center

5190.54 --> 5195.719
so they can be processed like we always

5193.12 --> 5195.719
have done

5215.71 --> 5222.39
[Music]

5223.9 --> 5227.82

5283.12 --> 5289.179
support again if you guys can

5286.239 --> 5292.839999999999
give it I really hope that while my

5289.179 --> 5295.6
little Revelation here about how

5292.84 --> 5297.76
I should expand it

5295.6 --> 5299.9800000000005
it's not just globalism in general I

5297.76 --> 5302.62
mean globalism doesn't just universally

5299.98 --> 5305.339999999999
breed xenophobia

5311.02 --> 5317.620000000001

5314.739 --> 5322.0199999999995
migration policies breed intense

5317.62 --> 5322.0199999999995
xenophobia that's the proper title

5325.42 --> 5330.28
and it's so freaking funny because like

5328.36 --> 5332.5599999999995
how are you gonna stop this

5330.28 --> 5335.58
how are you gonna mark this title when

5332.56 --> 5335.580000000001
you read this title

5336.46 --> 5341.44
you might notice that

5339.04 --> 5343.42
you're actually reading it from a

5341.44 --> 5346.12
globalist perspective

5343.42 --> 5347.86
so one of my little trixies that's my

5346.12 --> 5351.099999999999
little word magic

5347.86 --> 5354.699
yeah little narrative magic yeah I mean

5351.1 --> 5356.139
who's this anti-globalist

5354.699 --> 5358.9
no

5356.139 --> 5360.34
it's my title anti-globalist

5358.9 --> 5363.04
no

5360.34 --> 5365.860000000001
it's it merely

5363.04 --> 5368.8
telling you oh you want globalism oh

5365.86 --> 5371.799999999999
what what is the ideal of all that yeah

5368.8 --> 5375.400000000001
is it xenophobia is that what you want

5371.8 --> 5377.26
is that the the ideal of globalism no no

5375.4 --> 5380.92
that's exactly what you didn't want

5377.26 --> 5384.58
wasn't it so how are you gonna

5380.92 --> 5386.62
accomplish this globalism with this

5384.58 --> 5389.62
stupid migration policy that's gonna

5386.62 --> 5390.78
breed intense xenophobia

5389.62 --> 5394.84
huh

5390.78 --> 5397.599999999999
you're gonna flirt me for that am I up

5394.84 --> 5399.9400000000005
right now or off left or whatever

5397.6 --> 5402.34
however the [ __ ] you flag things I don't

5399.94 --> 5404.32
know man I don't get it anymore I just

5402.34 --> 5407.02
know that

5404.32 --> 5409.299999999999
this is honest analysis it's a

5407.02 --> 5412.84
conclusion it's in Our Winning guarantee

5409.3 --> 5415.6
it's gonna happen it's gonna increase

5412.84 --> 5417.1
and you better do something about it

5415.6 --> 5420.1
quick

5417.1 --> 5422.4400000000005
huh or you could have a real serious

5420.1 --> 5423.6
problem on your hands because when

5422.44 --> 5427.12
people

5423.6 --> 5429.52
become actually xenophobic

5427.12 --> 5432.28
because of government torture

5429.52 --> 5434.679
psychological torture that's when the

5432.28 --> 5437.5
[ __ ] really will hit the fan

5434.679 --> 5440.82
and then it's sour then it's gonna be

5437.5 --> 5443.82
really sour and bitter after that yeah

5440.82 --> 5447.34
especially for these disgusting

5443.82 --> 5448.96
officials and politicians

5447.34 --> 5451.4800000000005
they're gonna

5448.96 --> 5454.6
really feel some heat under their feet

5451.48 --> 5458.138999999999
then because now in a world where we

5454.6 --> 5460.54
basically are not xenophobic natural is

5458.139 --> 5461.86
like the natural conditioning

5460.54 --> 5465.76
yeah

5461.86 --> 5467.5
people are tolerating these scumbags

5465.76 --> 5470.320000000001
because of that

5467.5 --> 5473.739
yeah so guess what happens when you're

5470.32 --> 5477.34
breeding more xenophobia can you feel

5473.739 --> 5480.94
the heat under your feet can you feel

5477.34 --> 5484.84
can you hear the crackling of the wood

5480.94 --> 5488.678999999999
can you smell the bacon of your burnt

5484.84 --> 5491.860000000001
skin yet huh why'd you keep going keep

5488.679 --> 5495.28
going keep going with this policy ah see

5491.86 --> 5497.58
what happens see what happens

5495.28 --> 5497.58
foreign

5524.02 --> 5528.400000000001
right anyway

5526.0 --> 5531.1
I hope this is worth the

5528.4 --> 5534.759999999999
some contribution I can really use some

5531.1 --> 5536.8
PayPal still I I know I've got some

5534.76 --> 5538.84
what I really like trying to push

5536.8 --> 5542.860000000001
through this

5538.84 --> 5546.2390000000005
and bills freaking freaking bills it's

5542.86 --> 5546.239
always freaking bills

5548.44 --> 5552.28
and they always come when you least

5550.06 --> 5555.400000000001
expect it

5552.28 --> 5559.92
so yeah please support me

5555.4 --> 5559.92
I hope I'm worth it I'm doing my best

5560.86 --> 5564.699
foreign

5562.12 --> 5566.26
it's kind of tough to be super intense

5564.699 --> 5569.678999999999
while you're also at the same time

5566.26 --> 5572.52
trying to not be too loud

5569.679 --> 5572.52
it's kind of tough

5573.159 --> 5577.96
thank God I can literally just get

5575.32 --> 5580.719
closer to the camera to for dramatic

5577.96 --> 5581.7390000000005
effect and that's effectively doing the

5580.719 --> 5584.58
same

5581.739 --> 5584.58
yo

5584.86 --> 5591.36
drunken bullet my man thank you thank

5588.699 --> 5591.36
you very much

5591.52 --> 5594.52
foreign

5595.0 --> 5600.719
thank you for the 20 bucks I really

5597.76 --> 5600.719
appreciate that

5629.5 --> 5634.26
those are terrible Energy prices are

5631.84 --> 5634.26
going yeah

5634.36 --> 5638.199
this is also beside that there is

5636.46 --> 5640.719
actually a bit of an energy crisis

5638.199 --> 5643.719
because of horrific management there's

5640.719 --> 5646.719
also another Ponzi scheme going on

5643.719 --> 5649.6
I don't know if you've guys heard of it

5646.719 --> 5651.58
but there was like an Enron Scandal you

5649.6 --> 5653.679
can literally Google this because that

5651.58 --> 5657.12
is like an Infamous event

5653.679 --> 5657.12
Enron scandal

5661.0 --> 5664.08
when did that happen

5664.6 --> 5671.38
yeah 2001 in America

5668.26 --> 5674.38
and they literally just like

5671.38 --> 5676.6
rigged up the prices to just absurd

5674.38 --> 5678.219
levels although this was really like in

5676.6 --> 5679.84
the company that was just basically

5678.219 --> 5682.179
blackmailing

5679.84 --> 5685.2390000000005
and they upped the prices to insane

5682.179 --> 5687.28
levels and made like huge amount of

5685.239 --> 5689.5
money out of that they literally just

5687.28 --> 5691.78
stole it from the people well

5689.5 --> 5694.3
there's a little bit of that going on

5691.78 --> 5696.46
now too it's just a little bit more

5694.3 --> 5698.139
organized with the government in and on

5696.46 --> 5702.219
in and all that yeah

5698.139 --> 5704.5
but you can trust me on this that the

5702.219 --> 5706.12
energy companies are making record

5704.5 --> 5708.4
profits

5706.12 --> 5710.679
you think that's a coincidence

5708.4 --> 5712.719
are they being forced to basically

5710.679 --> 5715.32
compensate

5712.719 --> 5715.32
no

5716.139 --> 5723.82
so it might not be as egregious

5720.1 --> 5725.5
as like what Enron did at the time

5723.82 --> 5729.28
but

5725.5 --> 5732.1
it is much more widespread this time and

5729.28 --> 5735.5199999999995
it is basically a fascist operation it's

5732.1 --> 5737.320000000001
it's in this case in direct conjunction

5735.52 --> 5739.620000000001
with the governments

5737.32 --> 5742.54
that are causing it that are literally

5739.62 --> 5745.0599999999995
unnecessarily causing this energy crisis

5742.54 --> 5746.38
and they're just letting the companies

5745.06 --> 5749.92
profit over it and they probably

5746.38 --> 5752.56
invested in them yeah I think all these

5749.92 --> 5755.08
globalists that are causing this I think

5752.56 --> 5758.320000000001
they are invested I think they got

5755.08 --> 5760.659
stocks in energy and they might not have

5758.32 --> 5762.28
it themselves but I'm sure a family

5760.659 --> 5766.0599999999995
member does

5762.28 --> 5768.219
yeah I'm sure they do because they knew

5766.06 --> 5770.639
this was gonna happen and they knew all

5768.219 --> 5770.639
along

5778.54 --> 5782.58
yeah so that's what's going on too

5785.98 --> 5790.599999999999
they know it they know they're creating

5788.199 --> 5793.32
this and they're promoting of it you

5790.6 --> 5793.320000000001
know they are

5793.6 --> 5799.4800000000005
like they would be ashamed at this point

5796.42 --> 5803.38
if they weren't profiteering of it

5799.48 --> 5805.239
you know it because they are Grapplers

5803.38 --> 5807.639
it's not even it's at this point it's

5805.239 --> 5809.62
not even like a Jew anymore it's just a

5807.639 --> 5812.26
Graveler

5809.62 --> 5815.58
it's very little to do with the original

5812.26 --> 5815.58
religion at this point

5817.06 --> 5821.6990000000005
all right but anyway I'm going to take a

5818.44 --> 5821.699
two minute break I'll be right back

5842.08 --> 5844.32
foreign

5888.639 --> 5891.639
foreign

5928.42 --> 5931.42
foreign

5943.38 --> 5947.62
policy yeah but

5944.96 --> 5949.719
[Music]

5947.62 --> 5952.42
you just seen it the the green policies

5949.719 --> 5956.679
like concerning CO2 and

5972.88 --> 5976.26

5995.26 --> 5998.26
login

6020.4 --> 6025.32
I'm glad you're doing well by the way

6022.38 --> 6027.2390000000005
enough for you to feel that it's okay to

6025.32 --> 6030.239

6027.239 --> 6032.58
guys

6030.239 --> 6036.44
oh from you too

6032.58 --> 6036.44
young cat thank you so much

6036.96 --> 6039.78
wow

6038.699 --> 6043.0199999999995
this is

6039.78 --> 6045.78
turning out to be a really

6043.02 --> 6048.2390000000005
awesome show

6045.78 --> 6050.34
oh I do also appreciate what I've

6048.239 --> 6053.299999999999
basically put down

6050.34 --> 6056.46
I feel very focused for some reason

6053.3 --> 6058.860000000001
what really

6056.46 --> 6060.96
oh my God they want to like send a

6058.86 --> 6063.719
message like every move you make now

6060.96 --> 6066.719
through PayPal Jesus

6063.719 --> 6066.719
foreign

6072.659 --> 6076.5599999999995
I don't get it

6074.94 --> 6079.5
why would you need

6076.56 --> 6082.820000000001
to have the freaking text message every

6079.5 --> 6082.82
single time you do anything

6093.54 --> 6098.82
anyway thank you both

6096.179 --> 6102.26
thank you very much for your support

6098.82 --> 6102.259999999999
it'll keep me going

6103.44 --> 6107.0599999999995
and prevent me from getting

6107.58 --> 6110.36
cranky

6110.94 --> 6115.678999999999
and low energy

6113.639 --> 6119.219
because that's what happens when I yeah

6115.679 --> 6122.04
when I don't get smoke anything and I

6119.219 --> 6123.42
don't eat anything or not enough not

6122.04 --> 6124.86
healthy enough yeah that's what happens

6123.42 --> 6127.139
so

6124.86 --> 6129.9
so this keeps me fed it keeps me going

6127.139 --> 6134.0
and keeps me focused

6129.9 --> 6134.0
so thank you very much for the support

6157.58 --> 6162.719
capitalism yeah I know there's nothing

6159.48 --> 6165.799999999999
to do with capitalism but

6162.719 --> 6165.8
maybe a little

6168.0 --> 6172.86
but it's not stable capitalism I mean a

6170.76 --> 6176.04
capitalist in a capitalist system you

6172.86 --> 6179.96
should not be able to basically

6176.04 --> 6179.96
steal [ __ ] like that

6186.84 --> 6191.58
PayPal doesn't want the transaction to

6189.0 --> 6194.48
happen without you knowing about it

6191.58 --> 6194.48
it was what

6198.6 --> 6203.88
it helps cut that now but that's fine it

6201.48 --> 6206.94
just why would you need that all the

6203.88 --> 6209.82
time like why would you need to put a

6206.94 --> 6212.82
code in like within a time span of two

6209.82 --> 6216.44
minutes just for one action

6212.82 --> 6216.44
that makes no sense at all

6220.98 --> 6227.04
I mean if they like asked you to do like

6224.28 --> 6230.5199999999995
a code thingy like every week or so I'd

6227.04 --> 6232.5
be like annoying but I get it but this

6230.52 --> 6235.139
is just ridiculous

6232.5 --> 6238.44
why would you need to have like a phone

6235.139 --> 6242.04
text code like within the time twice

6238.44 --> 6245.0
within two minutes that makes no sense

6242.04 --> 6245.0
at all

6248.639 --> 6251.42
so

6251.76 --> 6254.4800000000005
but whatever

6268.38 --> 6272.06
hey by the way hello singe man

6275.159 --> 6280.58
I think Scott's getting rich

6278.58 --> 6283.7699999999995
we've been around for a while

6280.58 --> 6283.7699999999995
[Music]

6283.8 --> 6287.6
seemed to be very stable

6301.56 --> 6307.280000000001
[Music]

6303.48 --> 6310.379999999999
email it change your address with

6307.28 --> 6312.239
right yeah yeah I can imagine that's

6310.38 --> 6315.36
that's gonna be a hassle I mean if

6312.239 --> 6318.239
you're actually going to try to change

6315.36 --> 6320.699
like the root information

6318.239 --> 6323.58
that is actually a good moment to be

6320.699 --> 6326.759999999999
extremely secure because that's the way

6323.58 --> 6329.4
people literally hack your account away

6326.76 --> 6331.139
right somebody just suddenly like oh

6329.4 --> 6333.719
changing the address that's highly

6331.139 --> 6335.04
suspicious I mean that's the time to

6333.719 --> 6337.26
really start

6335.04 --> 6338.88
piping up the security in such a moment

6337.26 --> 6339.96
because that's exactly what hackers

6338.88 --> 6342.36
would do

6339.96 --> 6343.46
right they move it away oh change the

6342.36 --> 6347.28
address

6343.46 --> 6349.02
change the phone number Etc right yeah

6347.28 --> 6350.759999999999
it is a pain in the ass of course but

6349.02 --> 6353.34
you don't have to do that every day

6350.76 --> 6355.679
right so it's just a one-time thing and

6353.34 --> 6358.76
that's the time you want it even though

6355.679 --> 6358.76
it is a pain in the ass

6364.679 --> 6367.76
you know what

6369.659 --> 6375.5599999999995
what's globalism on the flood Earth yeah

6372.119 --> 6375.5599999999995
it's a bit trolley

6395.4 --> 6402.619
right oh man I can't believe

6399.48 --> 6402.619
time is almost over

6403.46 --> 6411.659
let's see is there any kind of Link nope

6409.139 --> 6414.9800000000005
I think Nathan's gonna really do just a

6411.659 --> 6414.98
one-man stream or something

6418.139 --> 6422.659000000001
four more hours

6422.659 --> 6427.339999999999

[Music]

6436.28 --> 6443.639
yes star Casey I agree I'm not against

6440.179 --> 6445.8
that sort of thing it's just that

6443.639 --> 6449.52
you don't need to have that shoved in

6445.8 --> 6452.46
your face twice within the time span of

6449.52 --> 6456.080000000001
two minutes that's all I mean you can't

6452.46 --> 6456.08
just overdo it at some point

6457.02 --> 6459.679
foreign

6464.119 --> 6473.159
I'm sorry Fiverr I appreciate the

6468.119 --> 6475.86
gesture but like I I need a a break

6473.159 --> 6478.619
after after a while you know like after

6475.86 --> 6480.78
two hours uh yes but I've been kind of

6478.619 --> 6484.28
intense you know

6480.78 --> 6484.28
so yeah

6490.02 --> 6496.7390000000005
I'm not gonna be able to do it like

6492.92 --> 6498.49
another hour maybe like a half an hour

6496.739 --> 6501.709999999999
or something

6498.49 --> 6501.71
[Music]

6502.86 --> 6507.54
but I'm I'm also kind of waiting to see

6505.08 --> 6510.92
the announcement of Nathan's

6507.54 --> 6510.92
members only stream

6510.96 --> 6516.719
maybe be part of that if he has a panel

6513.78 --> 6519.5599999999995
at all I don't know if he does

6516.719 --> 6519.56
whoa

6520.02 --> 6524.280000000001
fiber hopes thank you wow this is

6522.42 --> 6527.0
amazing

6524.28 --> 6527.0
man

6530.58 --> 6535.5
there any bucks

6533.46 --> 6539.54
wow

6535.5 --> 6539.54
well this is certainly making

6541.679 --> 6548.2390000000005
my coming week look a lot brighter oh

6544.92 --> 6548.2390000000005
another text yes of course

6548.82 --> 6551.82
yay

6553.28 --> 6556.46
of course

6558.9 --> 6565.4
see that was literally twice within the

6562.199 --> 6565.4
time span of one minute

6576.42 --> 6579.78
right anyway it's still worth it though

6578.639 --> 6582.7390000000005
I mean

6579.78 --> 6582.739
I'm getting paid

6587.699 --> 6594.599999999999
and really overall I am despite the

6592.199 --> 6596.28
history and all that [ __ ] I am very

6594.6 --> 6601.159000000001
thankful to people that they will

6596.28 --> 6601.159
actually allow me to just do what I do

6608.46 --> 6612.96
I mean I

6610.38 --> 6615.42
I would not know really what to do

6612.96 --> 6617.52
without it I have not like found any

6615.42 --> 6621.42
suitable other payment system like

6617.52 --> 6624.06
PayPal oh camera freeze

6621.42 --> 6628.08
oh no wait no not cat what I thought it

6624.06 --> 6628.080000000001
was a camera freeze it wasn't yeah

6628.86 --> 6634.08
right but it's just like I don't know

6631.739 --> 6636.9
any other stable reliable system that

6634.08 --> 6639.36
could work similarly

6636.9 --> 6642.299999999999
and there's like systems in the United

6639.36 --> 6645.599999999999
States other type of systems like what

6642.3 --> 6648.54
is it cash app or something but all that

6645.6 --> 6650.6990000000005
stuff only works in the United States I

6648.54 --> 6651.84
don't know any other alternative beside

6650.699 --> 6654.9
PayPal

6651.84 --> 6658.34
that can do this I don't know any that

6654.9 --> 6658.339999999999
can work here

6658.44 --> 6663.9
so I'm just really thankful that they're

6660.9 --> 6666.08
not like trying to censor me or kick me

6663.9 --> 6666.08
out

6666.84 --> 6673.219
it says live in Nathan's title what

6670.619 --> 6673.219

6733.699 --> 6737.0
my God

6737.34 --> 6745.4400000000005
I mean it's the best running joke ever I

6740.94 --> 6748.259999999999
mean do it again do it again but Jesus

6745.44 --> 6751.46
okay here I go again

6748.26 --> 6751.46
checking PayPal

6753.36 --> 6755.54
foreign

6762.36 --> 6766.5
this is turning out to be like the best

6764.639 --> 6770.1
payday this month

6766.5 --> 6771.42
I thought that the last time was good

6770.1 --> 6775.4400000000005
wow

6771.42 --> 6778.5
I mean I seriously need it I mean I

6775.44 --> 6780.419999999999
threw this rent increase and all that I

6778.5 --> 6782.639
have I have been kind of like building

6780.42 --> 6786.4800000000005
up debt

6782.639 --> 6789.36
by basically not paying my standard

6786.48 --> 6793.0199999999995
medical bill like it's just you have to

6789.36 --> 6795.119
pay anyway right the don't ever appeal

6793.02 --> 6797.76
to it because when you do you still have

6795.119 --> 6799.679
to pay a lot of money and you don't

6797.76 --> 6802.1990000000005
really get anything out of it at all

6799.679 --> 6805.08
every time I tried it

6802.199 --> 6807.0
but yeah you can kind of like not pay

6805.08 --> 6810.6
them and it's gonna stack up and they're

6807.0 --> 6812.88
like the least aggressive about it so

6810.6 --> 6815.820000000001
I've been trying to do that just to be

6812.88 --> 6819.0
able to get by and eat and [ __ ]

6815.82 --> 6821.46
right but eventually I'm afraid I will

6819.0 --> 6822.36
be forced to somehow pay that back and

6821.46 --> 6823.679
yeah well

6823.679 --> 6829.9800000000005

6849.9 --> 6856.0199999999995
the code twice this time

6852.96 --> 6858.199
I'm almost like what wait it just let me

6856.02 --> 6860.6990000000005
do that okay

6858.199 --> 6863.638999999999
you deserve a thank you man I really

6860.699 --> 6867.839999999999
appreciate that I do my best I do my

6863.639 --> 6870.06
best to be as deservant of it as I can

6867.84 --> 6873.78
always doing my best always being honest

6870.06 --> 6876.719
and never backing down because of some

6873.78 --> 6878.82
potential fear or the ruffling of

6876.719 --> 6882.78
feathers I mean I ruffle feathers it's

6878.82 --> 6885.619
what I do I don't necessarily like

6882.78 --> 6885.619
uh

6887.46 --> 6893.219
I don't Slaughter sacred cows like Owen

6890.82 --> 6894.78
Benjamin tends to do because he's just

6893.219 --> 6898.5
very good at it

6894.78 --> 6901.44
but I definitely ruffle feathers I'm the

6898.5 --> 6904.139
guy that's gonna come along

6901.44 --> 6907.099999999999

6924.96 --> 6931.26

6927.6 --> 6932.6990000000005
have to feel [ __ ] like oh

6931.26 --> 6936.06
I have to

6932.699 --> 6939.0599999999995
ration my mayonnaise now

6936.06 --> 6941.34
because I can otherwise I will not be

6939.06 --> 6943.860000000001
able to have mayonnaise with my French

6941.34 --> 6946.139
fries in the next two days because I

6943.86 --> 6949.139
can't afford a new pot I mean I've been

6946.139 --> 6952.08
dealing with that situation quite

6949.139 --> 6954.42
frequently that's not a joke guys I have

6952.08 --> 6957.239
to literally like sometimes rash in my

6954.42 --> 6960.6
mayonnaise or my bread because I just

6957.239 --> 6962.099999999999
can't afford anything new it's that

6960.6 --> 6964.5
that

6962.1 --> 6966.54
and it's not even that bad because I

6964.5 --> 6967.8
know in other countries and third world

6966.54 --> 6969.78
countries

6967.8 --> 6971.9400000000005
what the [ __ ] mayonnaise what do you

6969.78 --> 6975.119
mean bread

6971.94 --> 6978.178999999999
if you don't find stuff you can pull out

6975.119 --> 6980.159
of the ground you just starve so yeah I

6978.179 --> 6982.619
know it could be worse

6980.159 --> 6984.239
but for the Netherlands this is it is

6982.619 --> 6987.199
kind of poor

6984.239 --> 6987.199
just saying

6990.94 --> 6996.178999999999
[Music]

6993.5 --> 6998.52
but yeah with with the help of you guys

6996.179 --> 7001.54
I can basically

6998.52 --> 7001.540000000001
stay out of that

7004.76 --> 7011.3
mayonnaise on fries yeah really

7008.139 --> 7014.0
I mean and by the way that's not fries

7011.3 --> 7016.04
that is being bought in some snack bar

7014.0 --> 7019.639
or anything now I actually make it

7016.04 --> 7022.219
myself because that's cheaper

7019.639 --> 7023.84
and healthier arguably because I do it

7022.219 --> 7025.699
in olive oil and there's no snack bar

7023.84 --> 7028.34
out there that actually makes french

7025.699 --> 7030.0199999999995
fries fried in olive oil they don't do

7028.34 --> 7032.659000000001
that so they use

7030.02 --> 7034.6990000000005
uh what do you call it again a sunflower

7032.659 --> 7037.58
seed oil most of the time and that's

7034.699 --> 7039.86
actually bad like I that's bad for your

7037.58 --> 7042.5599999999995
brain last time I tried that I could

7039.86 --> 7045.199
literally feel like I feel like my IQ

7042.56 --> 7047.06
just went down to any points

7045.199 --> 7049.098999999999
it got it got better

7047.06 --> 7051.9800000000005
I mean it just didn't do it anymore and

7049.099 --> 7054.92
then after like a few days of just

7051.98 --> 7058.218999999999
eating without that and olive oil and

7054.92 --> 7060.9800000000005
all that it kind of restored back so but

7058.219 --> 7063.56
like I don't eat fries from snack bars

7060.98 --> 7065.718999999999
because they fry it in the wrong fat and

7063.56 --> 7067.88
they do it every time because that's

7065.719 --> 7070.82
like what is standardized it's like no

7067.88 --> 7073.28
sun sunflower oil that's the standard

7070.82 --> 7076.34
and it's terrible it's not good for you

7073.28 --> 7078.08
it makes you dumb it makes me dumb I

7076.34 --> 7081.1990000000005
don't know about other people with but I

7078.08 --> 7084.619
could literally feel that

7081.199 --> 7085.5199999999995
but when I do my French fries in olive

7084.619 --> 7087.799999999999
oil

7085.52 --> 7090.4400000000005
like uh

7087.8 --> 7093.139
like without any smell and taste of the

7090.44 --> 7095.299999999999
actual olives because that's gross

7093.139 --> 7098.659000000001
to fry it and that is really gross don't

7095.3 --> 7101.900000000001
do that only like denaturized

7098.659 --> 7105.0199999999995
uh yeah that's actually great

7101.9 --> 7106.219
it doesn't make you dumb it's very yeah

7105.02 --> 7107.84
feeding

7106.219 --> 7110.2390000000005
fats are good

7107.84 --> 7112.84
like that

7110.239 --> 7112.839999999999
so

7113.179 --> 7120.08
all heated oils turn into a neurotoxin

7116.659 --> 7123.08
well I think that with olive oil

7120.08 --> 7125.659
it does eventually I mean you can't use

7123.08 --> 7127.699
the same olive oil forever that's that's

7125.659 --> 7129.86
absolute fact

7127.699 --> 7133.0599999999995
like I can

7129.86 --> 7133.0599999999995
fry like

7134.06 --> 7141.820000000001
10 to 20 times with one

7138.08 --> 7141.82
batch of olive oil

7142.34 --> 7147.32
but I have to like constantly sift it

7144.5 --> 7149.84
and all that make sure that all the crap

7147.32 --> 7151.759999999999
doesn't keep reheated because if you

7149.84 --> 7154.159000000001
just leave one fry in there and like

7151.76 --> 7156.4400000000005
reheat it 20 times that's really bad

7154.159 --> 7158.36
that's when like the real toxins

7156.44 --> 7160.098999999999
start to pollute

7158.36 --> 7162.38
the oil

7160.099 --> 7164.42
and I can feel it I can literally taste

7162.38 --> 7166.46
like I need to refresh this oil it's

7164.42 --> 7168.679
getting spoiled

7166.46 --> 7171.92
it's getting bad

7168.679 --> 7174.1990000000005
so I yeah I have to do that like

7171.92 --> 7176.42
I think I refresh it like in between

7174.199 --> 7179.0599999999995
every month and every two months I have

7176.42 --> 7182.719
to do that or it's just gonna

7179.06 --> 7187.34
make me very very sick

7182.719 --> 7190.46
an air fryer yeah no I absolutely not I

7187.34 --> 7193.159000000001
want the oil I absolutely need that oil

7190.46 --> 7195.08
I don't do freaking air fryer

7193.159 --> 7197.679
not a

7195.08 --> 7197.679
h

7198.98 --> 7204.259999999999
animal fat lard that would be great

7202.04 --> 7208.119
I where do you get that I don't even

7204.26 --> 7211.280000000001
know where they like organic animal fat

7208.119 --> 7214.94
what what is that where did you get that

7211.28 --> 7216.139
I've never even seen anything like that

7214.94 --> 7218.178999999999
ever

7216.139 --> 7221.4400000000005
I mean I've heard that yeah frying an

7218.179 --> 7221.4400000000005
animal fat is actually good

7221.78 --> 7228.04
I don't know where to get it where do

7223.88 --> 7228.04
you buy that I could never find that

7228.619 --> 7234.08
not organic anyway so

7231.38 --> 7237.86
but I'm settling for olive oil that

7234.08 --> 7241.04
that's how my parents used to do it

7237.86 --> 7243.5
always and we learned that in Spain you

7241.04 --> 7245.679
gotta fry fries in olive oil that's the

7243.5 --> 7249.86
right oil to do it in

7245.679 --> 7252.08
and yeah it works great for me like I've

7249.86 --> 7255.339999999999
been doing that for a long time and that

7252.08 --> 7255.34
is the thing that works for me

7256.94 --> 7261.98
roast pork and lamps

7259.239 --> 7263.54
okay fine drunken blood look I'm not

7261.98 --> 7269.0199999999995
shaming

7263.54 --> 7269.0199999999995
air fryer I just I'm not a big fan of it

7273.56 --> 7278.139
Eastern Europe it's in the normal

7275.36 --> 7278.139
supermarket

7279.5 --> 7284.0
oh

7281.84 --> 7285.9800000000005
okay well maybe it's in the normal

7284.0 --> 7288.8
Supermarket here too

7285.98 --> 7292.04
but I don't actually do my groceries in

7288.8 --> 7296.179
the normal Supermarket I go to the

7292.04 --> 7296.179
organic only supermarket

7298.159 --> 7304.46
and I have not seen them have but you

7301.639 --> 7306.92
know what the next time I will actually

7304.46 --> 7309.08
pay extra careful attention to see if

7306.92 --> 7310.54
there is anything like that because if

7309.08 --> 7313.239
there was like

7310.54 --> 7317.48
organic lard

7313.239 --> 7318.619
non-pick based lard please I yeah I mean

7317.48 --> 7320.9
the demands are going to be a little

7318.619 --> 7323.119
high here on my side

7320.9 --> 7324.799999999999
right because I think the most lard is

7323.119 --> 7327.259999999999
actually like Pig lard but there might

7324.8 --> 7329.56
be like b-flard I don't know I did I

7327.26 --> 7331.52
don't know

7329.56 --> 7334.04
I yeah

7331.52 --> 7336.1990000000005
I've never even really

7334.04 --> 7339.139
dug into like how

7336.199 --> 7342.82
like if I could get lard

7339.139 --> 7342.82
but I will keep a lookout

7343.04 --> 7350.239
but olive oil works great for me so far

7346.219 --> 7351.7390000000005
it really does it works out fine as long

7350.239 --> 7354.0199999999995
as I keep refreshing the oil

7351.739 --> 7357.0199999999995
periodically because if you don't that's

7354.02 --> 7358.820000000001
when it turns into like wretched that's

7357.02 --> 7361.099
like when it starts to literally just

7358.82 --> 7364.099
attack your guts

7361.099 --> 7365.96
if you wait too long with refreshing the

7364.099 --> 7369.7390000000005
oil

7365.96 --> 7371.719
I literally feel it like ow this is not

7369.739 --> 7375.44
good fat that is like trying to be

7371.719 --> 7379.06
assimilated here it hurts

7375.44 --> 7379.0599999999995
huh anyway

7379.34 --> 7385.360000000001
I probably made you all hungry now sorry

7382.88 --> 7385.36
about that

7387.98 --> 7395.659
prefer to use pallet Grill

7392.199 --> 7398.419999999999
okay look if that if it's a system like

7395.659 --> 7400.46
that all works for you guys I'm not

7398.42 --> 7404.599
telling you to do it differently

7400.46 --> 7409.34
I'm just like a pan guy I like

7404.599 --> 7412.219
putting it in the pan with butter or oil

7409.34 --> 7414.5
and that's how I like to do it it works

7412.219 --> 7416.9800000000005
great for me I am also very good with

7414.5 --> 7416.98
fats

7417.139 --> 7424.6990000000005
I'm a fat guy not literally I like that

7420.739 --> 7427.839999999999
fat is good for me I'm like look

7424.699 --> 7427.839999999999
and then not get sick

7428.599 --> 7434.360000000001
well not literally Google that's [ __ ]

7432.5 --> 7437.659
gross but you know what I mean I like

7434.36 --> 7440.5
eating fat it's good for me I'm not like

7437.659 --> 7444.0199999999995
oh I can't have the calories

7440.5 --> 7447.5
no give me that freaking oil man give me

7444.02 --> 7449.659000000001
that fat it's mine I need it to keep my

7447.5 --> 7452.36
brain all huge

7449.659 --> 7454.58
literally stop eating fat I just start

7452.36 --> 7457.48
to become dumb

7454.58 --> 7457.48
I need it

7464.659 --> 7470.9
I'm definitely not

7467.119 --> 7473.839999999999
low fat intake I'm a high fat intake and

7470.9 --> 7477.98
works great for me I'm not freaking fat

7473.84 --> 7480.92
right I mean for a 42 year old guy this

7477.98 --> 7482.0
is not fat I'm not like super Slinky and

7480.92 --> 7485.4800000000005
all that

7482.0 --> 7487.699
but yeah for somebody that literally has

7485.48 --> 7492.259999999999
the amount of volume of fat that I take

7487.699 --> 7494.299999999999
in I'd say I'm not fat at all

7492.26 --> 7498.5
but that's also because I actually

7494.3 --> 7502.099
believe that if you eat healthy fat

7498.5 --> 7505.28
it makes you slimmer

7502.099 --> 7507.26
it has for me I have been chubbier

7505.28 --> 7512.659
when I was

7507.26 --> 7515.599
21 to 23 I weighed like 10 pounds more

7512.659 --> 7518.299999999999
than I did now than I do now

7515.599 --> 7519.860000000001
and that was before I started to eat

7518.3 --> 7523.639
high fat

7519.86 --> 7527.0199999999995
so literally fat made me lose weight

7523.639 --> 7527.02
and grow my brain

7527.719 --> 7535.04
and also my liver loves it I have never

7530.54 --> 7537.44
had liver problems why because of fat

7535.04 --> 7539.96
only thing that has a little bit of a

7537.44 --> 7541.638999999999
counter side to that is

7539.96 --> 7543.679
my pancreas

7541.639 --> 7545.2390000000005
my pancreas has it a little heavy

7543.679 --> 7547.34
sometimes

7545.239 --> 7549.138999999999
but yeah that might have always become a

7547.34 --> 7552.34
problem since I was like super sugar

7549.139 --> 7552.34
addicted when I was a kid

7553.06 --> 7560.4400000000005
Oakley just went live

7556.699 --> 7560.44
no four minutes

7561.739 --> 7566.659
right but I am gonna round out the show

7563.719 --> 7568.159
then I guess

7566.659 --> 7571.4
it's been great

7568.159 --> 7573.32
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

7571.4 --> 7575.96
like this show and I think you guys did

7573.32 --> 7578.0
you there's definitely showed me

7575.96 --> 7580.04
if you did then please don't forget the

7578.0 --> 7582.32
rogans it up by the way this whole

7580.04 --> 7584.0
rogans gag that I kept doing thanks to

7582.32 --> 7586.46
Owen Benjamin

7584.0 --> 7588.26
I'm actually starting to consider like

7586.46 --> 7590.96
maybe not calling it rogans anymore

7588.26 --> 7592.6990000000005
because Joe Rogan is so [ __ ]

7590.96 --> 7595.04
disgusting and Evil

7592.699 --> 7598.46
it's almost not even funny anymore to

7595.04 --> 7599.659
just call him a toe or a thumb

7598.46 --> 7603.199
to me

7599.659 --> 7604.879999999999
that's how much he's repulsing me

7603.199 --> 7606.98
so I've been doing it like forever

7604.88 --> 7608.96
Rogan's it up you know

7606.98 --> 7611.959999999999
but I'm actually considering just

7608.96 --> 7615.7390000000005
calling it thumbs up again because I

7611.96 --> 7618.92
like even referencing Joe like a joke is

7615.739 --> 7621.678999999999
just becoming in bad taste it's starting

7618.92 --> 7624.26
to taste bad to me

7621.679 --> 7626.36
but we'll see it's very hard for me to

7624.26 --> 7628.76
get habits out of my system so for now

7626.36 --> 7631.159
it's going to be rogans it up
