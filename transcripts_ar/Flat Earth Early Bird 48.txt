5.6 --> 14.16
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

9.929 --> 19.65
early-bird number 48

14.16 --> 24.84
I'm your host Arwen and yeah today is

19.65 --> 33.349999999999994
the second or third Christmas day 27

24.84 --> 38.67
skipped yesterday's early bird because I

33.35 --> 41.1
was very late and just really didn't

38.67 --> 45.78
feel like doing anything I had a pretty

41.1 --> 53.55
extreme early but was late for that and

45.78 --> 56.480000000000004
two hours and 21 minutes and yeah I

53.55 --> 59.91
thought okay everyone that's how

56.48 --> 63.269999999999996
interests interested in my show can just

59.91 --> 66.75
use that day to basically continue I

63.27 --> 74.369
think because it was a pretty fast hang

66.75 --> 80.28
out anyway I did go on freaking go his

74.369 --> 80.82
hangout yesterday night with some other

80.28 --> 84.75
people

80.82 --> 87.50899999999999
chocolate saying was there and Shane was

84.75 --> 91.71
there and yeah it was relatively

87.509 --> 99.57
interesting and I tried to be me

91.71 --> 102.96
typically me in vegan voice hang out to

99.57 --> 105.329
do what I do and because I knew it was

102.96 --> 110.29899999999999
gonna trigger him and that's funny

105.329 --> 113.72
because I think it's kind of funny like

110.299 --> 117.77000000000001
triggering vegan boy

113.72 --> 121.45
by being a goodie two-shoes because he

117.77 --> 129.46
can't stand that and I think that's

121.45 --> 133.0
tragically hilarious so so when he says

129.46 --> 137.14000000000001
I've nothing left earlier for an old man

133.0 --> 140.09
and telling him no no of course you

137.14 --> 142.94
there's so much in there for it all

140.09 --> 145.85
depends on your personal perspective and

142.94 --> 149.35999999999999
goals and they was basically trying to

145.85 --> 153.23
start up a self realization process in

149.36 --> 155.12
from the inside and yeah of course we

153.23 --> 160.16
didn't go he's not gonna accept that

155.12 --> 162.53
from anyone else but himself so he

160.16 --> 167.29999999999998
immediately responded as he typically

162.53 --> 169.91
does then it was to be expected but it

167.3 --> 174.35000000000002
was more about him hearing it him

169.91 --> 177.44
hearing sense and the social response is

174.35 --> 180.47
not really essential for that it's just

177.44 --> 183.68
essential for his consciousness to hear

180.47 --> 188.739
it and then later in secret he can

183.68 --> 192.17000000000002
decide how to deal with that information

188.739 --> 194.18
after he's declared his social response

192.17 --> 197.08999999999997
in public which of course that he

194.18 --> 199.18
doesn't need that it's idiotic and etc

197.09 --> 199.18
etc

200.75 --> 206.24
that's not really why I do it and undo

203.24 --> 212.53
it for these social responses on the

206.24 --> 215.8
spot I do it to transform their souls to

212.53 --> 215.8
for the better

218.129 --> 225.57999999999998
and especially people that are just too

220.78 --> 228.73
freakin stubborn to change and the one

225.58 --> 232.45000000000002
should be the same there's love nothing

228.73 --> 234.64
more lovely than actually helping to

232.45 --> 237.25
change somebody when their consciousness

234.64 --> 239.04899999999998
does not want to but their sub

237.25 --> 241.51
consciousness demands it

239.049 --> 244.92000000000002
despite their consciousness protesting I

241.51 --> 249.54899999999998
find that one of the most fascinating

244.92 --> 252.97
things there is to see somebody being

249.549 --> 255.19
forced to change from the inside against

252.97 --> 261.22
their conscious will by their

255.19 --> 264.06
subconscious will so yeah hello

261.22 --> 267.55
everybody in chat Pete Mars is here

264.06 --> 269.94
mister ricks che Mack flat ball peanuts

267.55 --> 269.94
Clarke

274.86 --> 285.89
it's pretty mild weather today and I'm

278.64 --> 289.95
so so lost yesterday I had an amazing

285.89 --> 293.87
Christmas dinner it's not a traditional

289.95 --> 295.68
Christmas dinner but very close for me

293.87 --> 300.87
where yeah

295.68 --> 303.78000000000003
I got lots of chocolate lots and lots of

300.87 --> 309.3
chocolate a very good organic chocolate

303.78 --> 312.71
and I as planned when I started I broke

309.3 --> 316.31
my vegetarian cold on purpose

312.71 --> 321.14
with the one exception on Christmas as

316.31 --> 326.73
promised when I started it and yeah we

321.14 --> 330.27
we ate chicken and I prepared myself

326.73 --> 333.92
very thoroughly to do that because yeah

330.27 --> 338.58
I haven't eaten any kind of meat for

333.92 --> 343.2
two-thirds of a year so I took my time

338.58 --> 345.45
chewing that stuff and yeah well I

343.2 --> 347.61
haven't become extremely sick or

345.45 --> 351.93
anything and it actually feels kind of

347.61 --> 358.8
okay it didn't have as much trouble as I

351.93 --> 360.87
thought it would and yeah I'm just gonna

358.8 --> 364.86
do exactly what I thought I was gonna do

360.87 --> 368.21
I'm gonna keep continue being vegetarian

364.86 --> 372.33000000000004
and just having that chicken for

368.21 --> 375.51
Christmas and keep doing that and the

372.33 --> 377.78999999999996
reasoning behind it think that if I

375.51 --> 381.18
completely banning the option of eating

377.79 --> 384.57
meat out of my life permanently then I

381.18 --> 388.53000000000003
may grow so out of it that were there

384.57 --> 392.49
any necessity to consume meat for what

388.53 --> 394.02
reason so ever then I might not be able

392.49 --> 396.81
to do it anymore

394.02 --> 399.41999999999996
I'd really become sick at a time that I

396.81 --> 402.07
couldn't afford itself if I eat chicken

399.42 --> 406.3
once a year

402.07 --> 409.64
then perhaps my body will never

406.3 --> 413.06
completely a hundred percent adjust to

409.64 --> 417.28999999999996
being vegetarian and the option to

413.06 --> 422.93
consume and process meat will still be

417.29 --> 426.92
inside of my body so I can always eat me

422.93 --> 434.08
if it is necessary all right yeah I

426.92 --> 434.08000000000004
don't need to like being vegetarian

437.68 --> 450.03000000000003
so captain caps-lock Jose good to see

444.85 --> 450.03000000000003
you guys for now

451.06 --> 456.33
so yeah the years almost ended good

460.02 --> 468.21
after this four more days because

463.44 --> 474.03
Tuesday Tuesday the next week is the

468.21 --> 481.38
first of the 2019 new year so time has

474.03 --> 485.82
slipped by now hasn't gone particularly

481.38 --> 488.43
fast in my opinion my personal from my

485.82 --> 490.38
personal perspective from my conscious

488.43 --> 495.81
experience point of view it's not gone

490.38 --> 498.54
by that fast but hasn't gone very slow

495.81 --> 501.15
either right now I turn it around it

498.54 --> 503.1
hasn't gone by slowly but it hasn't gone

501.15 --> 507.96
by all that fast either that's what I

503.1 --> 514.91
wanted to say so I think I'm gonna try

507.96 --> 514.91
to throw the panel open by inviting some

515.0 --> 522.11
people into the back chat hang out

537.07 --> 543.23
[Music]

538.71 --> 543.23
yeah hold on getting there

556.55 --> 562.81
so I'm putting love the link outs in

559.81 --> 562.81
Skype

570.49 --> 578.41
right and I'm just gonna put out Dilli

573.7 --> 585.9100000000001
right here because I can because I can

578.41 --> 591.66
afford to do that yeah so yeah if you

585.91 --> 591.66
want you can joy I got the back panel

594.71 --> 598.12
so the plant the time

598.74 --> 605.529
and we have you know what we can't talk

602.02 --> 609.5699999999999
about 2018 or whatever although I'd

605.529 --> 615.04
probably prefer to do such a thing on

609.57 --> 620.5500000000001
December 31st 31st and I am going to

615.04 --> 620.55
probably stream at that moment as well

621.87 --> 629.3100000000001
so yeah please do come back and no I'm

627.42 --> 632.61
not getting a cold

629.31 --> 634.8
what the issue is is I overslept

632.61 --> 638.46
surprise surprise I had a lot to eat I

634.8 --> 640.7099999999999
went to bed are very very very late even

638.46 --> 645.96
had a shower very late because it was

640.71 --> 648.1500000000001
necessary hello I mean hey Jose I'll get

645.96 --> 648.96
back to you but I thought it I don't

648.15 --> 651.6
have a cold

648.96 --> 656.4200000000001
it's just that I woke up 15 minutes for

651.6 --> 656.4200000000001
two and when I wake up I have a lot of

657.38 --> 662.97
what get I guess some people would see

659.94 --> 665.82
it as cold symptoms but it's really

662.97 --> 669.51
short it's just getting snotty and all

665.82 --> 671.82
that and after an hour that's completely

669.51 --> 674.0699999999999
vanished and there's no trace of it so

671.82 --> 677.85
no I'm not getting sick I have this

674.07 --> 684.95
almost every morning I think it's a side

677.85 --> 691.1800000000001
effect of smoking I don't know

684.95 --> 697.9300000000001
could be a lot worse but anyway hey Jose

691.18 --> 697.93
how are you doing man baby

701.52 --> 707.6
was a

704.31 --> 707.5999999999999

808.04 --> 815.779
sorry but it's not even close in any

813.68 --> 818.899
sense to the way I look

815.779 --> 823.67
not even remotely close I think Jose

823.67 --> 835.9699999999999
right I'm here now hey all good all good

832.43 --> 838.31

838.31 --> 842.0889999999999
man all right

840.11 --> 845.99
do you troll do you put the link public

yeah are you able to hide the hide in

845.99 --> 853.3100000000001
the screen and all that good stuff hide

849.47 --> 855.259
this tree hi the screen like the screen

853.31 --> 857.3
with the Hangout the logos doesn't play

855.259 --> 865.67
somebody tried to jump into porn bomb do

857.3 --> 871.399
some [ __ ] I don't see the codes being

865.67 --> 872.81
displayed in OBS itself so no yeah I'm

871.399 --> 874.55
not watching YouTube so I don't know

872.81 --> 876.3499999999999
what this what you represent and you're

874.55 --> 878.99
presenting yourself only and the logos

876.35 --> 882.769
as we speak yeah you should know how

878.99 --> 885.019
they're presenting myself in the logo oh

882.769 --> 887.839
sorry what yeah I mean whatever you

885.019 --> 890.87
presenting on YouTube keep their keep

887.839 --> 893.5100000000001
the Hangout hidden because if if

890.87 --> 894.68
somebody jump in with a with some porn

893.51 --> 897.199
in the avatar

894.68 --> 898.9399999999999
oh yeah yeah yeah in the icon you know

897.199 --> 901.699
you're gonna get one look I can't just

898.94 --> 904.49
if that happens I'll just click this

901.699 --> 905.899
really quickly okay yeah that's why I

904.49 --> 907.37
asked it because I don't know what setup

905.899 --> 910.01
you're presenting on YouTube and that's

907.37 --> 913.25
what we know now I have one more issue

910.01 --> 915.8
with my volume because I've noticed that

913.25 --> 921.05
my own microphone volume is actually

915.8 --> 923.06
lower than everybody else's you're

921.05 --> 925.459
pretty much parallel with with Jose

923.06 --> 928.6099999999999
which I guess could be no I totally

925.459 --> 932.959
disagree my volume seems to be at 2/3 of

928.61 --> 935.72
a level as all my guests really yes

932.959 --> 937.939
literally not on YouTube when I was

935.72 --> 940.26
listening you were a little lower than

937.939 --> 942.81
usual yeah and I don't like that I know

940.26 --> 945.87
so I want to try to change that actually

942.81 --> 948.78
uh but I'll have to get into the mixer

945.87 --> 951.36
and I have no idea how to do that

948.78 --> 956.04
properly I use I basically need some

951.36 --> 958.38
genuine behind-the-scenes posting I win

956.04 --> 959.3399999999999
you've got those sliders there where you

958.38 --> 962.64
can yeah

959.34 --> 964.98
they're all at full well then turn down

962.64 --> 967.71
turn down the other one and keep yours

964.98 --> 970.47
at full the other one keep the mic up

967.71 --> 972.99
keep the Mikey go bleep keep the mic

970.47 --> 976.58
full and then turn down the other audio

972.99 --> 980.04
to about like half or 60% so like just

976.58 --> 981.5400000000001
that's what I do I don't know I'll ask

980.04 --> 985.0799999999999
if you guys

981.54 --> 988.53
I'll ask Chet so guys if you could help

985.08 --> 995.69
me out for a moment and test it I've

988.53 --> 1000.02
turned down the desktop audio in in OBS

995.69 --> 1002.12
2-10 decibel and my mic is the same so

1000.02 --> 1004.31
could you compare the sounds I'm talking

1002.12 --> 1007.3100000000001
right now so P Mars

1004.31 --> 1020.6899999999999
Jose Eric if you could talk now for a

1007.31 --> 1023.0899999999999
moment so thanks parrot right sounds

1020.69 --> 1025.4
good yeah but how is the volume

1023.09 --> 1028.24
comparator of my volume comparing to

1025.4 --> 1031.25
theirs is it now the same level yeah

1028.24 --> 1035.23
it's closer it's pretty close good but

1031.25 --> 1035.23
how can you hear it your your interface

1035.5 --> 1044.54
okay alright I'll I'll have to it's a

1042.71 --> 1045.5
lot closer it's pretty close I don't

1044.54 --> 1048.05
know I mean I don't know how you can get

1045.5 --> 1049.7
identical but it's close enough I think

1048.05 --> 1052.28
it sounds they're saying it's a matter

1049.7 --> 1055.13
of sizing it up I just tried out -10

1052.28 --> 1058.87
decibel and well if everybody in chess

1055.13 --> 1064.75
has my infinite loops as its equal now a

1058.87 --> 1067.34
bit back up a bit so my volume is now

1064.75 --> 1069.68
higher than the rest do you think I

1067.34 --> 1076.37
should uh put a little

1069.68 --> 1080.24
okay I'll go for the -9 decibel or minus

1076.37 --> 1086.36
nine point three so guys talk again so

1080.24 --> 1087.22
they can compare it to want to check

1086.36 --> 1092.09
check one two

1087.22 --> 1094.97
all right so how is that is that now

1092.09 --> 1100.85
really e.coli up there volume a little

1094.97 --> 1104.6000000000001
bit so people chat some feedback oh by

1100.85 --> 1106.85
the way hello Alicia champagne okay

1104.6 --> 1109.82
there for Gilbert says it's good I'll

1106.85 --> 1112.9699999999998
leave it like this for now and yeah

1109.82 --> 1115.55
luckily enough OBS remembers everything

1112.97 --> 1120.05
you changed so it'll be right there next

1115.55 --> 1122.6299999999999
time so I can keep it there right okay

1120.05 --> 1124.81
this your champagne says it's all good

1122.63 --> 1128.3200000000002
now so let's continue

1124.81 --> 1130.82
hello guys thanks for coming on my panel

1128.32 --> 1134.62

usual mostly thanks to the guest which

1189.2 --> 1198.8300000000002
somehow like a spell managed to temper

1195.5 --> 1200.06
vegan [ __ ] temporarily making him more

1198.83 --> 1203.1499999999999
socially

1200.06 --> 1208.1599999999999
acceptable up to a certain degree for a

1203.15 --> 1209.69
while that was interesting as well even

1208.16 --> 1211.8200000000002
though we disagree on a lot of things

1209.69 --> 1214.16
but it was nice to see you and you know

1211.82 --> 1218.6599999999999
you guys have a lot of extreme contrast

1214.16 --> 1221.0900000000001
yeah but I like it cuz here on this show

1218.66 --> 1225.14
I have to be the host and have to be

1221.09 --> 1228.74
very moderate and very yeah not very

1225.14 --> 1230.3600000000001
outspoken and seeking out conflicts

1228.74 --> 1232.91
although it might happen but I'm vegan

1230.36 --> 1236.3
go yeah he it's like an [ __ ] and he

1232.91 --> 1239.99
doesn't care so I can just be that

1236.3 --> 1248.09
[ __ ] from within Oh in my own way so

1239.99 --> 1252.17
yeah it's a like no you're wrong you

1248.09 --> 1254.24
know insulting and rampaging then you

1252.17 --> 1259.49
got your don't need conditioning

1254.24 --> 1261.6200000000001
that's because ditional ridicule so

1259.49 --> 1264.14
everybody start to follow that stays

1261.62 --> 1265.6999999999998
typical baller pattern and I think

1264.14 --> 1269.24
everything is alright that's when you

1265.7 --> 1271.73
get all the all the [ __ ] shovels in your

1269.24 --> 1274.73
quarter well I think it's good you keep

1271.73 --> 1276.6200000000001
this a bit more calm and kind of you

1274.73 --> 1279.05
know it can be arguing yelling and angry

1276.62 --> 1281.51
on every bit of Channel know especially

1279.05 --> 1284.33
during breakfast because yeah you'd

1281.51 --> 1285.89
become quite ill you are there pretty

1284.33 --> 1287.81
much right in the show yesterday what

1285.89 --> 1290.15
what's your take on how we went down

1287.81 --> 1294.8899999999999
yesterday I thought Eric offended

1290.15 --> 1300.47
chocolate staying but yeah totally you

1294.89 --> 1302.8700000000001
did you were trying to not be let's just

1300.47 --> 1306.44
say you were trying not to be a racist

1302.87 --> 1313.4599999999998
in the worst way somebody can try to do

1306.44 --> 1317.63
that I know it never is but you were in

1313.46 --> 1320.8700000000001
the world I didn't catch a lie but but

1317.63 --> 1322.7
about this I don't know how to rephrase

1320.87 --> 1325.28
it about that subject that chuckling was

1322.7 --> 1329.57
saying no it's racist but you got Eric

1325.28 --> 1332.72
was sane or vegan about grouping or

1329.57 --> 1334.22
whatever like if somebody was I don't

1332.72 --> 1337.039
know I'm just gonna make this one

1334.22 --> 1339.77
generalizing Roshan generalization

1337.039 --> 1341.809
exactly I had an opinion because it

1339.77 --> 1343.94
could be somebody from Russia and

1341.809 --> 1345.799
everybody thinks Russians are [ __ ]

1343.94 --> 1347.8400000000001
and [ __ ] communist or whatever

1345.799 --> 1349.82
[ __ ] but not everybody is the same

1347.84 --> 1352.4289999999999
because there's other generation there's

1349.82 --> 1355.7
other you know other types of education

1352.429 --> 1358.669
or their title or way they grow in the

1355.7 --> 1360.5900000000001
houses and they learn stuff and they go

1358.669 --> 1362.0
away and they learn a little quarters

1360.59 --> 1364.52
and [ __ ] not everybody

1362.0 --> 1366.95
you can not generalize everybody because

1364.52 --> 1369.65
everybody somebody certain race or

1366.95 --> 1371.72
religion or way of whatever you know

1369.65 --> 1373.52
just because they look like the orders

1371.72 --> 1375.2
you can not put them in the same boat

1373.52 --> 1378.049
you know yeah every culture has their

1375.2 --> 1382.13
own unique kind of [ __ ] and you

1378.049 --> 1386.36
recognize their culture by the way they

1382.13 --> 1389.8700000000001
are [ __ ] I mean they are all like

1386.36 --> 1392.9289999999999
that what's that big that big game from

1389.87 --> 1394.34
South America that rug Trump's ass like

1392.929 --> 1397.25
it's got a number what is that stuff

1394.34 --> 1402.3799999999999
they're all tattooed and pretty what's

1397.25 --> 1405.61
it called sorry that that gay that comes

1402.38 --> 1409.0390000000002
up a lot from Mexico Oh am i 13 what

1405.61 --> 1412.61
yeah those guys are crazy pretty easy to

1409.039 --> 1414.11
spot here are people so what we come on

1412.61 --> 1416.9599999999998
like is there anybody here that would

1414.11 --> 1421.1299999999999
want to be amongst those people I don't

1416.96 --> 1425.15
think so I mean we do those people are

1421.13 --> 1427.5800000000002
all soulless listen we do look at people

1425.15 --> 1429.919
you know like if we see these young guys

1427.58 --> 1433.1
with pants hanging around there we

1429.919 --> 1436.1000000000001
generalize listen hey that's it agian

1433.1 --> 1437.6589999999999
ms-13 generalized themselves they

1436.1 --> 1440.7199999999998
dehumanize them I'm sorry

1437.659 --> 1443.15
they are gonna very much okay we each

1440.72 --> 1444.679
you know listen people look at when I'm

1443.15 --> 1445.8500000000001
living in Asia people look at me and

1444.679 --> 1447.8300000000002
they generalize they think I'm rich

1445.85 --> 1449.6899999999998
because I'm come to west of us so I mean

1447.83 --> 1451.4289999999999
I think that it's just the nature of

1449.69 --> 1453.53
what people do it's up to us as

1451.429 --> 1456.3200000000002
individuals I guess to prove people

1453.53 --> 1458.87
wrong by our actions and our you know

1456.32 --> 1460.49
our behavior so I mean if people want to

1458.87 --> 1462.35
judge me and look at me and think that I

1460.49 --> 1466.39
mean I can't stop that the only thing I

1462.35 --> 1466.3899999999999
can do is is to prove them wrong

1466.45 --> 1470.51
you know yeah the way what I used to I

1468.86 --> 1473.33
used to live in a penis spot in Puerto

1470.51 --> 1475.37
Rico it was a like project like really

1473.33 --> 1476.78
rough projects now and it was a lot of

1475.37 --> 1479.4199999999998
drugs he was a lot of criminal

1476.78 --> 1481.82
activities also there was a lot of good

1479.42 --> 1483.5600000000002
a lot of a lot of humbleness you know

1481.82 --> 1485.45
between the people everybody helped he

1483.56 --> 1487.19
showed everybody hang out you know so

1485.45 --> 1489.32
because I lived in the project they

1487.19 --> 1491.78
couldn't throw me in the bunch like I

1489.32 --> 1494.09
was the same as everybody because my dad

1491.78 --> 1496.49
was a pastor we were born and raised in

1494.09 --> 1498.32
the Christian environment we were really

1496.49 --> 1500.42
nice to straight people you know and

1498.32 --> 1502.22
humble and helping each other they

1500.42 --> 1504.5
couldn't throw me the same bones as the

1502.22 --> 1506.75
neighbors right to the left and they

1504.5 --> 1508.7
sold they used to sell coke and crack

1506.75 --> 1510.8
you know because we are not you know

1508.7 --> 1513.14
that's general that's the generalization

1510.8 --> 1515.57
I don't like because every because some

1513.14 --> 1517.8200000000002
people leave or are in the same bonds

1515.57 --> 1521.8999999999999
with others we cannot be tagging the

1517.82 --> 1523.8799999999999
time group you know well then you know

1521.9 --> 1525.1100000000001
even even people around you like if

1523.88 --> 1527.8400000000001
you're part of a certain kind of

1525.11 --> 1530.12
community let's say whatever skin color

1527.84 --> 1532.1599999999999
religion whatever and if it's a bad

1530.12 --> 1533.6
community and you actually stand up and

1532.16 --> 1535.8200000000002
do the good thing you'll get you'll get

1533.6 --> 1537.11
beaten down by the gangsters around

1535.82 --> 1538.52
you're like you know bro why why aren't

1537.11 --> 1541.34
you doing this and what's wrong with you

1538.52 --> 1548.57
and let's go do this no never happened

1541.34 --> 1550.9099999999999
no what never happened I don't know yeah

1548.57 --> 1553.1899999999998
that's obvious there seems to be a lot

1550.91 --> 1558.17
about that that you're trying to

1553.19 --> 1559.8200000000002
comprehend and you fail you fail it

1558.17 --> 1564.5600000000002
might happen in some situations but not

1559.82 --> 1566.24
all we're domi people around here well

1564.56 --> 1569.4199999999998
like hey why don't you have the US flag

1566.24 --> 1571.49
of patriotic no I don't want to fly it

1569.42 --> 1575.96
so I mean there's there is peer pressure

1571.49 --> 1578.66
and I think flying the flag yeah but

1575.96 --> 1587.54
that's because you are irrationally anti

1578.66 --> 1593.8400000000001
status status but you bring it very far

1587.54 --> 1596.09
so no you don't need to stop you just

1593.84 --> 1597.3799999999999
need to realize it when you do things

1596.09 --> 1598.9399999999998
that that is what act

1597.38 --> 1603.0200000000002
chili drives you and that is what people

1598.94 --> 1606.44
see driving you no matter what you're

1603.02 --> 1608.75
gonna our self that actually drives you

1606.44 --> 1610.8200000000002
differently you know well you guys just

1608.75 --> 1612.44
seem that culture is a good thing you

1610.82 --> 1614.03
haven't looked into culture and what it

1612.44 --> 1615.5900000000001
is and how bad it is

1614.03 --> 1619.37
you think culture is a good thing that's

1615.59 --> 1622.04
you know no cultures not a good thing a

1619.37 --> 1625.1899999999998
bad thing it is necessary and it is

1622.04 --> 1627.56
inevitable but it can be terrible it can

1625.19 --> 1632.0
be great it all depends on the how it is

1627.56 --> 1635.33
fabricated how it manifests and there

1632.0 --> 1638.41
what guidance mentality never is good

1635.33 --> 1647.6
yeah but mob mentality is not culture

1638.41 --> 1650.51
you know it's not you need to read books

1647.6 --> 1662.0
Eric yeah I have the culture tends to be

1650.51 --> 1666.37
wrong but it does have a bearing on

1662.0 --> 1666.37
culture it does influence culture

1666.49 --> 1673.64
everything influences culture mostly

1669.95 --> 1676.43
just in individuals is in perspective

1673.64 --> 1680.0
only individual and their conduct that

1676.43 --> 1682.55
reflects off the entire group it's not

1680.0 --> 1685.25
the mob mentality itself that's a

1682.55 --> 1688.3999999999999
different that's mass that's group

1685.25 --> 1693.11
psychology it's a different yeah that's

1688.4 --> 1698.0600000000002
like riots and [ __ ] yeah culture is

1693.11 --> 1700.31
individual but it reflects it does have

1698.06 --> 1702.98
some of some bearing on the shape of

1700.31 --> 1704.27
culture it's not culture but it has a

1702.98 --> 1706.49
bearing on the shape of culture

1704.27 --> 1708.47
everything has a bearing on the shape of

1706.49 --> 1710.3
culture everything of course it yeah

1708.47 --> 1716.45
yeah in consciousness it's some

1710.3 --> 1718.7
exploited people culture is a choice to

1716.45 --> 1720.5
me to me people use that this argument

1718.7 --> 1722.66
of culture whether it's right or wrong

1720.5 --> 1724.25
so culture can cover up that thinking

1722.66 --> 1727.0600000000002
bad behavior and people just say well of

1724.25 --> 1729.77
my culture so I don't really never be a

1727.06 --> 1733.04
big taste not a cop-out

1729.77 --> 1738.44
that's an assimilation that's what

1733.04 --> 1743.54
culture does culture is no it normalizes

1738.44 --> 1746.96
things good things and puts them in a in

1743.54 --> 1750.2
a specific structure that's solid and

1746.96 --> 1753.76
that relieves the person of moral

1750.2 --> 1757.76
contemplation surrounding these things I

1753.76 --> 1760.37
left I left I left Puerto Rico in 2005

1757.76 --> 1763.76
so it's been thirteen fourteen years now

1760.37 --> 1765.32
if I go back I feel uneasy in the

1763.76 --> 1767.059
streets of Puerto Rico because I feel

1765.32 --> 1769.1299999999999
more comfortable now of living in the

1767.059 --> 1771.17
United States because this is really

1769.13 --> 1773.72
tough and rough over there now

1771.17 --> 1776.45
I followed the culture I eat the food I

1773.72 --> 1777.89
like the music I like this slang you

1776.45 --> 1779.45
know the Puerto Rican slanging hanging

1777.89 --> 1782.5700000000002
out with Puerto Rican people that I find

1779.45 --> 1784.94
in the United States god I don't find

1782.57 --> 1788.4199999999998
myself just as equal of the other Puerto

1784.94 --> 1790.1000000000001
Ricans because I II I molded I already

1788.42 --> 1792.6200000000001
got molded myself in between the

1790.1 --> 1794.36
American culture more than the Puerto

1792.62 --> 1797.0
Rico is another generation that took

1794.36 --> 1799.6999999999998
over they are no respect for the

1797.0 --> 1801.71
individual and each other you know so I

1799.7 --> 1805.179
mean ethanol maybe it has nothing to do

1801.71 --> 1809.24
but I just want to give you a transition

1805.179 --> 1812.69
transition is so you've got best of both

1809.24 --> 1816.76
worlds you're feeling is anything living

1812.69 --> 1819.2
here in the US it's more individuality

1816.76 --> 1821.0
senator ik as opposed to Puerto Rico

1819.2 --> 1826.309
which is more just collective is that

1821.0 --> 1828.29
what you just sort of said in part but

1826.309 --> 1831.77
not necessarily because somebody over

1828.29 --> 1835.1299999999999
there is a lot individuality also but is

1831.77 --> 1837.8
different culture as you have to live a

1835.13 --> 1840.71
little more in the edge because if I

1837.8 --> 1842.84
mean it could be anything to happen as

1840.71 --> 1846.23
it could be more crimes at any moment

1842.84 --> 1849.3799999999999
any any little kid with a happy very

1846.23 --> 1851.3
bubbly eyes can have a gun and shoot

1849.38 --> 1853.3700000000001
your ass big just because you know a

1851.3 --> 1855.35
little more different than here you know

1853.37 --> 1857.36
I think it's rougher over there

1855.35 --> 1860.23
everybody have to have pages in the

1857.36 --> 1862.4399999999998
swinging windows high-tension versts

1860.23 --> 1864.299
there's like high tension

1862.44 --> 1867.96
bursts like lightning storms that

1864.299 --> 1871.1589999999999
constantly yeah if that will break out

1867.96 --> 1873.5
of nowhere because the similar thing

1871.159 --> 1875.669
exists in Indonesia by the way

1873.5 --> 1878.429
Indonesian people are also very much

1875.669 --> 1880.8300000000002
like that very peaceful but they have

1878.429 --> 1884.6100000000001
demons inside them and somebody can just

1880.83 --> 1887.129
go nuts I even have a specific name for

1884.61 --> 1891.33
it I do you guys think that might have

1887.129 --> 1894.6
something to do with a equal diverse mix

1891.33 --> 1899.519
what's the name Arvin they call it Matta

1894.6 --> 1903.24
clapping it's literally like being hit

1899.519 --> 1906.8990000000001
hit by a mattock that's pretty much what

1903.24 --> 1909.48
it translates to roughly so the person

1906.899 --> 1911.1589999999999
goes nuts they it's like them have

1909.48 --> 1913.289
having been hit in the head and they

1911.159 --> 1916.8600000000001
turn insane into basically another

1913.289 --> 1918.169
person a violent one it happens to some

1916.86 --> 1922.9189999999999
Indonesians

1918.169 --> 1926.46
especially males so a general acceptance

1922.919 --> 1930.029
of a demon take no it's not acceptance

1926.46 --> 1931.8890000000001
it's just something they keep in mind

1930.029 --> 1935.429
like oh yeah we have to be careful

1931.889 --> 1938.879
sometimes a guy especially a certain age

1935.429 --> 1942.0590000000002
bracket can suddenly go and turn into a

1938.879 --> 1945.32
violent maniac and we have to protect

1942.059 --> 1950.07
them from themselves when that happens

1945.32 --> 1952.98
that's what it is and usually it's the

1950.07 --> 1955.83
family that takes care of people that

1952.98 --> 1957.69
have that so they're just like okay he's

1955.83 --> 1961.74
going nuts restrain him until he's back

1957.69 --> 1965.21
to normal pretty much because it doesn't

1961.74 --> 1969.659
last forever it's like like a rage

1965.21 --> 1974.3400000000001
licking all night licking all night

1969.659 --> 1978.1390000000001
thing right it's it's like a rage if can

1974.34 --> 1981.12
set in and then they yeah the rage just

1978.139 --> 1983.309
keeps on going until they run out of

1981.12 --> 1985.049
steam and then it's like they fall

1983.309 --> 1989.46
asleep or whatever wake up and they

1985.049 --> 1992.54
don't have no memory what happened that

1989.46 --> 1994.82
is typical a typical story for Indonesia

1992.54 --> 1996.95
I'm not saying that everyone has that

1994.82 --> 2000.28
but it is a well-known cultural

1996.95 --> 2007.27
phenomena among these people that it has

2000.28 --> 2008.8899999999999
been given names and words so I guess

2007.27 --> 2012.07
there's other cultures around the world

2008.89 --> 2012.49
that have similar aspects oh yeah they

2012.07 --> 2017.4399999999998
do

2012.49 --> 2021.15
it's real no it's it's it runs this this

2017.44 --> 2024.3400000000001
runs right ramp is right across Asia

2021.15 --> 2027.8400000000001
yeah maybe oh Indonesia is pretty much

2024.34 --> 2032.1999999999998
the most Southeast Asia you can get and

2027.84 --> 2035.9199999999998
it seems to be surrounding that area a

2032.2 --> 2039.82
lot of people have this influence within

2035.92 --> 2044.22
them so I don't know maybe it's coming

2039.82 --> 2048.58
back from some ancient dormant now

2044.22 --> 2051.88
dormant Berserker people you know just

2048.58 --> 2054.4
like the Vikings were some of them were

2051.88 --> 2056.5
miseries although they used like things

2054.4 --> 2059.679
like mushrooms to accomplish it maybe

2056.5 --> 2063.16
some Southeast Asians in very long time

2059.679 --> 2065.919
ago were like this wall people that

2063.16 --> 2067.8399999999997
could then work themselves into a rage

2065.919 --> 2070.45
and suddenly become fierce fierce

2067.84 --> 2074.5
fighters that that was their strategy

2070.45 --> 2078.31
and maybe this thing is a remnant of

2074.5 --> 2083.01
this laying dormant within with within

2078.31 --> 2083.0099999999998
their genetics who knows

2083.08 --> 2088.0299999999997
well according to how I see it all you

2085.66 --> 2090.91
got right was it's laying dormant in

2088.03 --> 2094.6000000000004
their genetics everything else I pretty

2090.91 --> 2098.17
much would have disagreed with well it's

2094.6 --> 2100.5699999999997
coming from somewhere if there is a

2098.17 --> 2103.48
genetic in yeah if there is an impulse

2100.57 --> 2106.27
has no seemingly has no place that's

2103.48 --> 2108.16
because it has lost its place because it

2106.27 --> 2110.83
used to be there otherwise that thing

2108.16 --> 2116.14
that impulse would never have been there

2110.83 --> 2118.2999999999997
oh yeah genetics have very little to do

2116.14 --> 2122.3199999999997
oh really

2118.3 --> 2123.9700000000003
you think oh really you're wrong you're

2122.32 --> 2126.1800000000003
absolutely wrong genetics have

2123.97 --> 2130.8999999999996
everything to do with it Jen attics

2126.18 --> 2135.0699999999997
adapt adapt to a culture all right

2130.9 --> 2137.4700000000003
it's switches no it's not wrong it

2135.07 --> 2140.38
switches the switches adapt to the

2137.47 --> 2144.06
culture and that echoes for several

2140.38 --> 2146.5
generations in today you're you're

2144.06 --> 2150.2999999999997
associating see this is this is where

2146.5 --> 2153.7
this is where we run into huge problems

2150.3 --> 2157.03
because we're trying what you're doing

2153.7 --> 2160.2999999999997
is you're associating something we do

2157.03 --> 2163.3
not understand oh now you do not

2160.3 --> 2168.48
understand yeah I do

2163.3 --> 2172.57
I know what I'm talking about genetics

2168.48 --> 2174.82
genetics no genetics I understand demons

2172.57 --> 2177.82
I don't understand what who's talking

2174.82 --> 2181.27
about demons you're the one ring it in

2177.82 --> 2183.52
you know it's demonic possession it has

2181.27 --> 2188.04
nothing to do when I did I use the word

2183.52 --> 2188.04
demonic possession in this context

2189.13 --> 2194.77
oh really yeah something takes over a

2192.43 --> 2199.6
mindset a different type of character

2194.77 --> 2201.67
did I say a demon maybe that's my person

2199.6 --> 2204.37
yeah maybe it is maybe it is your

2201.67 --> 2206.98
insertion in this conversation because

2204.37 --> 2208.7799999999997
it wasn't there yet before I was just

2206.98 --> 2210.46
clearly talking about people and

2208.78 --> 2213.19
characters it wasn't referring to

2210.46 --> 2214.619
anything spiritual related obviously

2213.19 --> 2216.779
what takes over is

2214.619 --> 2219.21
or group of genes is what Arlen is

2216.779 --> 2221.64
trying to say so maybe it maybe yet

2219.21 --> 2225.059
maybe Catholic culture right it can't be

2221.64 --> 2228.779
a cultural cultures good oh really

2225.059 --> 2232.6800000000003
did I say so I don't know you're just so

2228.779 --> 2236.46
you seem like you have the absolute it's

2232.68 --> 2238.319
all genetic oh really it seems like

2236.46 --> 2240.93
you're stuck in a loop or everything

2238.319 --> 2243.299
that comes through your mind seems to be

2240.93 --> 2246.3289999999997
an overgeneralization of what's going on

2243.299 --> 2248.13
every single word you just used because

2246.329 --> 2250.92
I don't think it's all genetics I don't

2248.13 --> 2254.359
think our culture is good you're

2250.92 --> 2254.359
assuming all these things out of nowhere

2255.079 --> 2259.7690000000002
do you think do you think I wanted out

2257.849 --> 2261.7200000000003
this question to 2p marks on walls

2259.769 --> 2264.14
because I haven't heard most of them do

2261.72 --> 2267.1499999999996
you think that we all should maybe

2264.14 --> 2269.7
should put a little disclaimer in things

2267.15 --> 2271.799
we say it is something you say my

2269.7 --> 2274.2
opinion is this and it's a very strong

2271.799 --> 2276.059
suggestion that we all do this instead

2274.2 --> 2277.89
of saying this is the truth and this is

2276.059 --> 2280.1090000000004
the way it works do you think we should

2277.89 --> 2282.3289999999997
like this claim most of the things that

2280.109 --> 2286.109
we say when there are a little you know

2282.329 --> 2289.049
a little feisty it all depends if you're

2286.109 --> 2291.029
gonna suggest you should be doing this

2289.049 --> 2294.72
you should or we should be doing this

2291.029 --> 2296.789
then yes that is your opinion if you're

2294.72 --> 2299.569
just gonna analyze something you can

2296.789 --> 2304.6800000000003
either be correct or you can be mistaken

2299.569 --> 2306.0589999999997
there's no centuries doesn't the church

2304.68 --> 2307.2
paint during that sort of thing for

2306.059 --> 2309.299
centuries and they've never had a

2307.2 --> 2310.68
disclaimer have they yeah but that's a

2309.299 --> 2314.809
church that's because they're in power

2310.68 --> 2314.8089999999997
that's because they are the truth

2316.519 --> 2323.0089999999996
according to according according to

2319.47 --> 2324.8089999999997
themselves that well in the book in the

2323.009 --> 2328.529
book it says I am the truth

2324.809 --> 2331.259
the way the light they claim that that

2328.529 --> 2333.63
is them and that is completely wrong if

2331.259 --> 2336.239
if someone doesn't believe in the book

2333.63 --> 2338.73
they still have to conform to that what

2336.239 --> 2340.369
oops a is did I know they don't have any

2338.73 --> 2343.559
free will is that what you're saying no

2340.369 --> 2345.809
the book is based on the book is based

2343.559 --> 2348.0400000000004
but they're trying to say that the book

2345.809 --> 2350.8300000000004
is based on a lack of free will

2348.04 --> 2353.35
on real events they're saying it's based

2350.83 --> 2355.9
on real event if you believe that you

2353.35 --> 2358.69
think it's happened if you believe that

2355.9 --> 2362.44
those events happen then there's a book

2358.69 --> 2364.53
for here with the religion account if

2362.44 --> 2370.12
you don't believe it happened that way

2364.53 --> 2372.1000000000004
then that books are saying nope doesn't

2370.12 --> 2374.2599999999998
necessarily some it's just a different

2372.1 --> 2376.42
opinion or a different view yeah I don't

2374.26 --> 2378.94
leave anything close a you here's how I

2376.42 --> 2381.16
see it's just a different view I'm happy

2378.94 --> 2383.53
to discuss them I don't want to ram my

2381.16 --> 2386.95
view than someone else's throat no

2383.53 --> 2389.86
that's yeah notice that I did that and

2386.95 --> 2393.2799999999997
so I'm trying not to by the way and you

2389.86 --> 2397.03
gotta try harder buddy okay from what

2393.28 --> 2400.9
I've seen is that the Bible is inside of

2397.03 --> 2403.15
every Freemason Church right at the

2400.9 --> 2406.06
heart of it they have the Bible which is

2403.15 --> 2409.08
like to say in their way of saying look

2406.06 --> 2411.94
this is our greatest work ever the

2409.08 --> 2416.17
church can you explain what a freemason

2411.94 --> 2419.08
church's most Freemasons of a church

2416.17 --> 2427.66
have their own churches we're not mean a

2419.08 --> 2432.18
temple a temple right my apologies it's

2427.66 --> 2436.54
born but yeah at the heart of the temple

2432.18 --> 2439.69
at the Mason Masonic Temple is always

2436.54 --> 2447.73
their greatest work ever which is to say

2439.69 --> 2449.32
look we got them to believe this flat

2447.73 --> 2452.59
earthers pre Masonic you have a issue

2449.32 --> 2455.1400000000003
with that no Fred

2452.59 --> 2457.1800000000003
Flattr earth is a straight line aside

2455.14 --> 2458.98
observation at minimal observer hiding

2457.18 --> 2461.1099999999997
concluding that's you see something

2458.98 --> 2469.15
because it's there that's very flat

2461.11 --> 2471.34
earth is yeah everything religion well I

2469.15 --> 2481.819
mean sure but Flat Earth was brought to

2471.34 --> 2484.789
let it suffice again no yeah no reality

2481.819 --> 2489.92
create that the reality wasn't created

2484.789 --> 2493.489
by the Freemasons okay look the snow be

2489.92 --> 2496.119
Mars look hold on be Mars be Mars it's
