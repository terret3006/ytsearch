94.14 --> 98.78
tried the first time but the sound would

96.42 --> 103.159
just not go on I had to restart

98.78 --> 103.159
right the weather today is

103.619 --> 106.52
interesting

108.5 --> 112.7
certainly some beautiful moments

112.799 --> 117.72000000000001
the Sun out there and almost as bright

115.799 --> 124.159
as like on the screen

117.72 --> 124.15899999999999
like beside the ark the CGI in my show

124.619 --> 130.38
look two bright suns

128.88 --> 133.92
oh

130.38 --> 137.16
isn't that just amazing oh glitchy

133.92 --> 140.83999999999997
right anyway it's beautiful whether it

137.16 --> 140.84
didn't really change around

141.72 --> 145.319
just

143.04 --> 148.26
a couple of big yeah they're wearing big

145.319 --> 149.819
clouds yesterday but today it seemed

148.26 --> 153.42
well it seems like this

149.819 --> 156.23899999999998
so this like average sized clouds

153.42 --> 158.879
quite prominent no Haze in the

156.239 --> 160.98000000000002
background this time look at almost like

158.879 --> 163.62
purplish blue

160.98 --> 168.48
sky behind it

163.62 --> 171.56
so yeah beautiful Skies again today

168.48 --> 171.56
some more wind

172.2 --> 174.379
foreign

174.62 --> 178.64000000000001
ly enjoying that summer

180.41 --> 183.79999999999998
[Music]

186.78 --> 188.78
um

189.72 --> 196.62
hello Scott first in chat

192.239 --> 198.31
flatter Sage BJC net Suzy s Ellie G good

196.62 --> 201.37900000000002
to see you all

198.31 --> 201.379
[Music]

204.8 --> 212.58
it's Friday the 30th of September 2022

217.2 --> 221.83999999999997
and I don't really have a theme today

219.48 --> 221.84
yet

222.42 --> 226.04
yesterday I definitely did

227.28 --> 233.58
and yeah but Jesus Christ what the hell

230.519 --> 236.299
is going on with my cam

233.58 --> 236.299
what the hell

238.159 --> 242.06
stupid glitchiness

247.519 --> 251.72
I gotta be kidding me

255.84 --> 259.68
what is that

258.54 --> 262.38
[Music]

259.68 --> 266.0
oh goody

262.38 --> 266.0
it might be the wiring

268.32 --> 272.9
ugh

270.54 --> 276.8
well let's hope this

272.9 --> 276.79999999999995
stays stable now

279.9 --> 284.03999999999996
anyway

281.52 --> 286.68
uh yeah yesterday's show

284.04 --> 289.44
was

286.68 --> 292.02
interesting I watched actually I watched

289.44 --> 295.04
a part of it back

292.02 --> 295.03999999999996
and yeah

296.36 --> 303.47900000000004
the thing was is that the whole talking

299.94 --> 306.32
about it about politics at this point is

303.479 --> 310.08
just like almost making me nervous

306.32 --> 311.88
not that it like actually scares me but

310.08 --> 315.19899999999996
it's just that I'm afraid of getting

311.88 --> 315.199
caught up in that [ __ ]

315.84 --> 321.419
well I explained that even about the old

318.12 --> 325.16
left that they just want to like drag

321.419 --> 325.15999999999997
you in and then exhaust you

325.5 --> 330.539
so you either like just have to double

328.32 --> 331.919
down to the end with them

330.539 --> 334.919
or

331.919 --> 336.65999999999997
you're gonna be like

334.919 --> 338.639
cut off

336.66 --> 341.40000000000003
and then a whole bunch of people will

338.639 --> 343.94
turn against you because you're breaking

341.4 --> 343.94
their dreams

344.639 --> 349.44
it's very devious

346.62 --> 352.139
and I would like to have conversations

349.44 --> 354.71999999999997
about that

352.139 --> 357.74
with other people

354.72 --> 357.74
to compare it

358.139 --> 360.62
anyway

361.919 --> 369.38
I have not heard much of a follow-up

365.759 --> 369.38
to that item

373.44 --> 376.1
foreign

377.72 --> 384.84000000000003
what's this a fresh new article

382.08 --> 388.639
about Maloney

384.84 --> 388.63899999999995
globalist friends of Maloney

388.74 --> 392.3
the Aspen Institute

400.62 --> 403.639
oh [ __ ]

405.06 --> 410.28000000000003
oh [ __ ]

408.36 --> 412.91900000000004
damn it

410.28 --> 416.0
so I just hit the nail on the head

412.919 --> 416.0
before I even

416.819 --> 423.3
read into her this is

420.419 --> 424.62
I hate it when I'm right about bad

423.3 --> 426.3
things

424.62 --> 429.24
I hate it

426.3 --> 432.86
but thank God my intuition does actually

429.24 --> 432.86
point that [ __ ] out to me

436.979 --> 439.58
right

443.099 --> 448.5
but for whatever the circumstances have

446.22 --> 451.46000000000004
turned out to be

448.5 --> 454.319
you can bet your ass that she is there

451.46 --> 457.81899999999996
to create a ruckus

454.319 --> 457.819
to create a distraction

458.099 --> 463.52
she's out left

460.139 --> 463.52
that's what they do

464.28 --> 470.52
they're like the

466.86 --> 473.759
the Heckler that they want you to throw

470.52 --> 478.5
your Tomatoes at

473.759 --> 481.319
right and now she has two camps

478.5 --> 485.36
one virtue of supposedly being right

481.319 --> 485.36
wing against the local situation

485.46 --> 492.78
but also secretly still globalist

489.96 --> 494.88
on the on the world scale

492.78 --> 497.58
so

494.88 --> 502.4
that's like trying to match up the local

497.58 --> 505.31899999999996
people that are just trying to yeah get

502.4 --> 508.13899999999995
migration situation under control like

505.319 --> 510.41900000000004
them forming their own sort of cultures

508.139 --> 512.94
that are kind of criminal right good

510.419 --> 515.159
point this is a good thing to want to

512.94 --> 518.7
get under control it's one of the things

515.159 --> 521.58
that you typically go for the right wing

518.7 --> 523.2
right can't blame those people on the

521.58 --> 526.32
other hand yeah there's also the people

523.2 --> 527.399
that really don't want the globalist

526.32 --> 530.339
so

527.399 --> 532.74
by being what she is and doing what

530.339 --> 535.44
she's going to probably do unless she

532.74 --> 538.08
completely ends up ignoring the entire

535.44 --> 540.48
right wing and it was all just a ruse

538.08 --> 543.72
that could also be but if she doesn't

540.48 --> 547.76
then she's gonna try to basically create

543.72 --> 547.76
a Ruckus and play out

548.66 --> 553.92
anti-globalist against

551.279 --> 557.88
anti-immigration

553.92 --> 559.4399999999999
with yeah which are both factors from

557.88 --> 562.62
the same side

559.44 --> 566.0600000000001
so that's what they do

562.62 --> 566.0600000000001
or that's what they might do

568.14 --> 575.58
Outlet gets on the stage

571.5 --> 580.38
and creates division polarization

575.58 --> 583.2
and then if all goes well for them they

580.38 --> 586.2
manage to actually play out two sides

583.2 --> 590.22
that are both enemies of the globalist

586.2 --> 592.8000000000001
and make them damage each other

590.22 --> 595.64
alt left

592.8 --> 595.64
look out

597.0 --> 603.12
right but what could happen is that both

600.6 --> 605.16
of those oppositional sides will

603.12 --> 607.32
actually figure out what's going on here

605.16 --> 611.2199999999999
and what alt left is and then

607.32 --> 613.62
potentially unite against her instead

611.22 --> 615.9200000000001
that everybody will realize it was all a

613.62 --> 615.92
ruse

619.019 --> 621.62
right

622.38 --> 624.98
you know

626.16 --> 629.8199999999999
so that's what I'm thinking about and

628.2 --> 633.48
anticipating

629.82 --> 636.24
and they probably will do that even as a

633.48 --> 640.519
bit of a lightning rod as just the war

636.24 --> 640.519
with Russia starts to heat up

646.2 --> 652.019
I mean I can't imagine that like if if

649.019 --> 654.72
the war goes more serious

652.019 --> 656.88
and like other countries now also start

654.72 --> 660.1800000000001
to like get

656.88 --> 661.74
border scuffles and [ __ ] and things

660.18 --> 664.3199999999999
blowing up

661.74 --> 667.8
that she might like actually start to

664.32 --> 672.62
rant and Rave like a freaking Hitler

667.8 --> 672.62
like really hating on Russia and Putin

672.839 --> 679.2600000000001
I expect that to happen

676.38 --> 681.86
she certainly has the capability of

679.26 --> 681.86
doing that

682.079 --> 689.18
being like a loud

685.7 --> 689.1800000000001
hard speaker

689.579 --> 693.1999999999999
she's already demonstrated

695.459 --> 701.42
I'm just trying to

697.26 --> 701.42
back engineer what I think is coming

706.37 --> 711.18
[Music]

708.899 --> 712.56
a reverse engineer not back engineer

711.18 --> 714.3
that that would mean that it would

712.56 --> 716.1199999999999
already be there

714.3 --> 718.14
no

716.12 --> 722.16
it's not

718.14 --> 724.399
not in the third time bound Dimension

722.16 --> 724.399
anyway

725.07 --> 738.5
[Music]

744.8 --> 750.06
you think so PG seen it I don't know I

747.839 --> 752.22
don't know what the Italians

750.06 --> 755.959
think right now I don't even know what

752.22 --> 755.9590000000001
they think about what's Just Happening

756.11 --> 760.519
[Music]

762.6 --> 765.2
right

766.32 --> 769.8000000000001
I mean they might have no idea and

768.3 --> 771.4799999999999
they're still partying because they

769.8 --> 774.5
think they had a massive Victory or

771.48 --> 774.5
something I don't know

775.26 --> 781.38
not really tune in to like the local

778.32 --> 782.7
Italian news and all that

781.38 --> 786.56
then

782.7 --> 786.5600000000001
just the scene out there

787.32 --> 793.7600000000001
hey PJ cruising yeah it has been a long

790.079 --> 793.76
time where where have you been

804.72 --> 807.38
hmm

807.43 --> 811.7399999999999
[Music]

808.86 --> 813.6
oh

811.74 --> 816.12
problems

813.6 --> 819.3000000000001
with the misses okay

816.12 --> 821.579
is this good enough reason

819.3 --> 825.74
I mean that that sort of thing can like

821.579 --> 825.7399999999999
drain your life out of you

833.639 --> 837.5
I hope it's gonna work out for you

845.36 --> 851.54
hmm

847.7 --> 851.5400000000001
anyway welcome back

853.68 --> 856.8199999999999
blood says happen

858.12 --> 861.46
[Music]

870.899 --> 876.839
right but anyway I don't know how quick

873.54 --> 880.38
Italians are to catch up on what's

876.839 --> 883.2600000000001
happened oh this person actually is

880.38 --> 886.26
it like it could very well be that a

883.26 --> 889.4399999999999
whole bunch of people there

886.26 --> 891.42
were like already wary of who she was I

889.44 --> 894.3000000000001
mean they probably are much more

891.42 --> 896.8199999999999
researched on like the details of every

894.3 --> 898.92
person there in politics said

896.82 --> 902.1600000000001
it might be that there's a whole bunch

898.92 --> 905.04
of people that just don't get a voice

902.16 --> 907.74
or that are not very loud on social

905.04 --> 911.279
media or they might all be banned

907.74 --> 912.5600000000001
that just knew like this person is a an

911.279 --> 916.86
infiltrate

912.56 --> 918.5999999999999
yeah a controlled opposition

916.86 --> 921.779
out left

918.6 --> 923.6990000000001
so I don't know how many people in Italy

921.779 --> 926.1
are aware of it I mean could be that

923.699 --> 928.9399999999999
it's mostly just like youngsters

926.1 --> 928.94
drawn in

932.94 --> 938.4590000000001
I'm not aware

935.519 --> 940.74
I've not like dug into people that just

938.459 --> 942.42
know about these type of Statistics over

940.74 --> 943.8
there

942.42 --> 945.959
right

943.8 --> 947.519
but we'll find out

945.959 --> 949.8599999999999
I mean

947.519 --> 952.94
over here we're certainly taking notice

949.86 --> 952.94
in the Netherlands

953.76 --> 956.95
[Music]

958.86 --> 963.5600000000001
as to like the background of this person

985.32 --> 989.94
that's interesting

987.6 --> 992.22
interesting

989.94 --> 995.4590000000001
it seems like the writer of this article

992.22 --> 998.1
also just still has doubts as they say

995.459 --> 1000.199
like well why did Maloney go to this

998.1 --> 1002.66
Aspen Institute

1000.199 --> 1006.3199999999999
by your own volition

1002.66 --> 1008.899
she wasn't like pull in or anything

1006.32 --> 1012.8000000000001
she went there what

1008.899 --> 1016.899
well apparently Victor Orban was also

1012.8 --> 1016.899
once sponsored by Soros

1019.459 --> 1025.8799999999999
kind of crushing it

1021.38 --> 1027.62
in Hungaria so yeah good point right and

1025.88 --> 1030.4
that's why even yesterday when I

1027.62 --> 1030.3999999999999
addressed it like

1031.04 --> 1037.78
it all depends on what the action route

1034.699 --> 1037.78
is going to be

1037.819 --> 1043.76
right it might all just be about options

1040.819 --> 1046.579
emergency options or whatever

1043.76 --> 1051.22
all depends on what you're gonna do

1046.579 --> 1051.22
but I don't have a good feeling about it

1053.0 --> 1057.839
right

1054.67 --> 1057.8390000000002
[Music]

1063.14 --> 1066.14
foreign

1067.85 --> 1071.57
[Music]

1074.799 --> 1081.679
anyway love to have a conversation about

1078.44 --> 1084.3200000000002
it if anybody has any information to

1081.679 --> 1087.0800000000002
share or

1084.32 --> 1089.72
something that I haven't said already or

1087.08 --> 1091.9399999999998
even if I already did then why not just

1089.72 --> 1094.539
say it again

1091.94 --> 1094.539
uh

1096.02 --> 1101.1399999999999
right other than that though

1098.419 --> 1105.8200000000002
letters debate yesterday was great

1101.14 --> 1105.8200000000002
lasted very long in the after show

1106.22 --> 1112.3600000000001
it was a good show

1109.039 --> 1112.36
I had some moments

1114.32 --> 1118.059
looking forward to seeing that back

1121.28 --> 1126.039
um

1123.08 --> 1126.039
what else

1128.48 --> 1131.14
oh

1132.14 --> 1138.38
oh PJ Cruikshank

1135.039 --> 1141.64
that sounds fantastic

1138.38 --> 1141.64
I could really use that

1142.64 --> 1146.72
right

1144.02 --> 1150.94
but anyway good to hear that you're

1146.72 --> 1150.94
doing better on the income situation

1152.299 --> 1156.98
good to have you back

1155.059 --> 1161.08
uh

1156.98 --> 1161.08
right what was I talking about

1163.58 --> 1169.1789999999999
what was on right flatter debate was

1166.82 --> 1169.1789999999999
great

1171.14 --> 1174.919
oh

1172.64 --> 1177.16
I missed a whole bunch of things I see

1174.919 --> 1177.16
now

1178.34 --> 1180.82
like

1181.34 --> 1187.52
a Quantum eraser Channel

1184.1 --> 1189.6789999999999
Betty had another show I guess missed

1187.52 --> 1192.62
out on that

1189.679 --> 1194.24
but I did not miss out on was Jim Bob go

1192.62 --> 1198.4599999999998
live

1194.24 --> 1198.46
that was interesting as usual

1204.98 --> 1209.84
oh apparently flat saw yeah weird flat

1207.98 --> 1213.5
side thing

1209.84 --> 1217.76
him debating himself

1213.5 --> 1220.28
like that was weird

1217.76 --> 1221.299
like that was like genuinely weird to

1220.28 --> 1225.62
watch

1221.299 --> 1227.9
like he was literally moderating himself

1225.62 --> 1230.9599999999998
debating himself

1227.9 --> 1233.44
like three times on camera that was just

1230.96 --> 1233.44
weird

1237.26 --> 1242.78
and his Russian flat earther accent was

1240.799 --> 1245.5
was hilarious

1242.78 --> 1245.5
uh

1246.559 --> 1250.7
a bit over the top but yeah what do you

1248.66 --> 1253.66
expect yeah

1250.7 --> 1253.66
all right what else

1256.64 --> 1262.1000000000001
yeah he is apparently gonna have

1259.46 --> 1265.7
um flat side

1262.1 --> 1267.32
the debate he had or is it like I don't

1265.7 --> 1268.28
know if it's live or record I think it's

1267.32 --> 1271.28
live

1268.28 --> 1273.9189999999999
between Brian leaky

1271.28 --> 1278.32
and Sean Hawkins and that should be

1273.919 --> 1278.3200000000002
playing out somewhere this evening goody

1290.62 --> 1294.6999999999998
all right that's about it

1298.299 --> 1303.799
it's called having a sense of humor

1301.52 --> 1306.02
okay

1303.799 --> 1310.059
I mean I thought it was funny but it was

1306.02 --> 1310.059
just also really weird to see that

1313.87 --> 1317.06
[Music]

1324.08 --> 1329.72
and yeah it was so weird that at first

1326.78 --> 1332.1789999999999
it took me some time to actually figure

1329.72 --> 1335.659
out that it's like him debating himself

1332.179 --> 1339.38
like that took me like five seconds

1335.659 --> 1341.96
like oh what is this oh that Russian guy

1339.38 --> 1344.5390000000002
against somebody with this silly hat

1341.96 --> 1347.179
then I realized like wait they both look

1344.539 --> 1350.26
a lot like flat side what the [ __ ] they

1347.179 --> 1353.9
sound like flat so that's flat-sided

1350.26 --> 1356.6589999999999
so it took me like five seconds

1353.9 --> 1359.1200000000001
but that was kind of funny

1356.659 --> 1361.159
anyway

1359.12 --> 1364.9599999999998
hello Scott

1361.159 --> 1364.96
lva Paul good to see you

1371.72 --> 1374.72
foreign

1377.96 --> 1381.8
foreign

1378.58 --> 1381.8
[Music]

1384.79 --> 1387.99
[Music]

1393.58 --> 1399.82
debates planned on for you lva Paul

1403.4 --> 1407.02
Brian will do well

1408.74 --> 1413.6
I don't know about that

1411.799 --> 1417.74
I mean

1413.6 --> 1420.4399999999998
in like a civil conversation he is okay

1417.74 --> 1423.26
but I mean again freaking Sean Hawkins

1420.44 --> 1425.6000000000001
Sean Hawk is just gonna like get on his

1423.26 --> 1427.96
nerves and once somebody gets on Brian's

1425.6 --> 1432.02
nerves he just goes loud and

1427.96 --> 1435.8600000000001
blabbermouthy and rumpacy so

1432.02 --> 1438.9189999999999
and then he won't shut up ever again

1435.86 --> 1441.799
and I think that Sean is pretty capable

1438.919 --> 1444.7
of basically pushing people there

1441.799 --> 1444.7
so

1445.28 --> 1452.3799999999999
I'm not sure how how well Brian's gonna

1447.98 --> 1452.38
do this is not like uh

1452.84 --> 1456.86
we're not talking about

1454.64 --> 1459.7
Brian's logic we're talking about Brian

1456.86 --> 1459.6999999999998
leaking here

1471.88 --> 1476.3600000000001
oh my God it's a guy with that crazy

1474.74 --> 1478.28
name again

1476.36 --> 1480.6789999999999
with five

1478.28 --> 1488.08
Four A's in it

1480.679 --> 1488.0800000000002
JD Fair bark a Buffon God damn it

1492.1 --> 1499.78
hello is your name is uh

1496.82 --> 1499.78
a bit annoying

1500.24 --> 1505.4
you've never heard Sean debate yet well

1503.059 --> 1509.86
you didn't really miss anything it just

1505.4 --> 1509.8600000000001
it does the same [ __ ] he does in chats

1512.179 --> 1515.14
foreign

1517.84 --> 1526.84
Hawkins once on the Polaris Challenge on

1521.179 --> 1526.8400000000001
JG Jose Jose JD Gonzalez Channel

1527.779 --> 1531.279
for a year ago maybe two

1561.919 --> 1566.2990000000002
you don't like Shauna welcome to the

1564.679 --> 1568.22
club I mean I don't think there's a lot

1566.299 --> 1569.539
of people that actually like Sean

1568.22 --> 1572.48
Hawkins

1569.539 --> 1574.82
they might find him entertaining or

1572.48 --> 1577.64
tolerable

1574.82 --> 1580.279
but uh

1577.64 --> 1582.5200000000002
don't think he has some real fans out

1580.279 --> 1582.52
there

1585.59 --> 1588.81
[Music]

1598.4 --> 1604.1200000000001
okay pgsy then

1601.279 --> 1604.12
foreign

1625.8 --> 1629.27
[Music]

1632.659 --> 1636.4
[ __ ] are you talking about

1637.76 --> 1639.94
thank you

1671.779 --> 1675.94
like serious what the hell are you

1673.52 --> 1675.94
talking about

1678.08 --> 1680.9189999999999
GID

1684.79 --> 1687.97
[Music]

1690.86 --> 1694.61
[Music]

1710.25 --> 1714.919
[Music]

1711.919 --> 1714.919
foreign

1715.32 --> 1720.059
[Music]

1745.22 --> 1749.96
or just ask a weird question out of

1748.039 --> 1753.2
nowhere

1749.96 --> 1755.24
and then just nothing

1753.2 --> 1757.22
I mean that's not a proper way of

1755.24 --> 1759.14
communication okay

1757.22 --> 1761.84
you want to ask me something or

1759.14 --> 1765.3400000000001
curiosity don't just like drop a few

1761.84 --> 1765.34
words and then run away

1771.679 --> 1777.94
I mean that kind of behavior is what

1774.26 --> 1777.94
typically makes me ban people

1778.1 --> 1782.299
because it's really annoying

1780.32 --> 1783.98
if you have a question

1782.299 --> 1787.48
get ready

1783.98 --> 1787.48
to be heard out

1787.94 --> 1792.26
on the details or like where did you

1790.46 --> 1796.159
hear that

1792.26 --> 1798.26
or can you please be elaborate someone

1796.159 --> 1801.38
what you're talking about don't just

1798.26 --> 1804.34
dump a sentence in there

1801.38 --> 1804.3400000000001
and then nothing

1825.679 --> 1828.679
foreign

1835.96 --> 1839.26
here's the thing

1840.2 --> 1847.279
just because you've heard something

1843.2 --> 1849.559
weird somewhere somehow doesn't mean

1847.279 --> 1852.38
that if you dump something in my chat

1849.559 --> 1853.76
I'm just immediately gonna google that

1852.38 --> 1856.279
yeah

1853.76 --> 1859.58
because I'm not gonna let people that I

1856.279 --> 1862.299
don't even know who they are direct what

1859.58 --> 1862.299
I'm gonna google

1863.659 --> 1869.14
I'm not gonna Google weird odd things

1869.419 --> 1875.6000000000001
yeah because Google actually like

1872.539 --> 1878.539
remembers that [ __ ] doesn't necessarily

1875.6 --> 1881.74
know I got that from some random weirdo

1878.539 --> 1881.74
in a chat

1882.26 --> 1887.72
so I'd like you to elaborate

1887.779 --> 1895.34
or I will kick you out after five

1891.74 --> 1897.52
minutes of silence JD with your idiotic

1895.34 --> 1897.52
name

1900.5 --> 1905.179
but I'm gonna kick you out just not

1903.38 --> 1908.0200000000002
tolerating this [ __ ]

1905.179 --> 1908.02
bye

1919.1 --> 1921.399
foreign

1925.58 --> 1930.98
then you better have some information

1927.38 --> 1934.279
presented as well about it because I'm

1930.98 --> 1938.72
not just gonna Google some random [ __ ]

1934.279 --> 1941.2
that somebody in a chat or my chat says

1938.72 --> 1941.2
okay

1941.659 --> 1945.2
yeah

1943.34 --> 1948.4399999999998
it's not that simple you're gonna have

1945.2 --> 1950.24
to actually try to provide some form of

1948.44 --> 1954.74
conversation

1950.24 --> 1957.3990000000001
and not just a mind fart dump and run

1954.74 --> 1957.3990000000001
okay

1961.46 --> 1964.96
so everybody clear on that

1972.34 --> 1975.51
[Music]

1977.419 --> 1982.8200000000002
because that type of thing is extremely

1980.48 --> 1985.159
disruptive it's disruptive to my

1982.82 --> 1988.22
concentration I just wasted five minutes

1985.159 --> 1990.8600000000001
because of the some guy saying something

1988.22 --> 1993.919
totally random and then not following up

1990.86 --> 1996.9799999999998
on anything about it

1993.919 --> 1999.019
not tolerating it anymore

1996.98 --> 2003.08
start a conversation

1999.019 --> 2007.49
have a point or I kick you out

2003.08 --> 2007.49
[Music]

2013.659 --> 2022.5590000000002
roommates having some visitors over

2017.44 --> 2022.559
and so yeah we're to get too excited

2051.399 --> 2054.06
things

2060.399 --> 2064.2
oh and apparently here in the

2062.26 --> 2067.599
Netherlands

2064.2 --> 2070.2999999999997
like there's some like public

2067.599 --> 2072.2200000000003
channels like from the television that

2070.3 --> 2075.099
are now actually rolling out that

2072.22 --> 2077.879
ridiculous nonsense that happened

2075.099 --> 2077.8790000000004
in America

2078.399 --> 2083.1389999999997
a year ago or more

2080.5 --> 2086.5
and they're saying now that milk is

2083.139 --> 2086.5
actually racist

2086.679 --> 2093.899
so they're rolling that out here now

2090.339 --> 2093.899
absolutely absurd

2108.88 --> 2115.54
I looked it up so you don't have to

2111.82 --> 2117.339
and what he said was absolute BS thank

2115.54 --> 2119.74
you huh

2117.339 --> 2121.48
Orinoco wumble did I call it or what

2119.74 --> 2124.1189999999997
yeah

2121.48 --> 2127.96
because I know when somebody's trying to

2124.119 --> 2129.88
make me Google [ __ ] I knew it I

2127.96 --> 2132.66
could feel it

2129.88 --> 2132.6600000000003
feel it

2134.44 --> 2138.82
thank you by the way that you jack I

2137.079 --> 2141.6400000000003
guess

2138.82 --> 2143.56
who is Sean laser light we're talking

2141.64 --> 2145.7999999999997
about Sean Hawkins

2143.56 --> 2145.7999999999997
foreign

2145.92 --> 2152.38
believing Boomer numpty extraordinary

2150.0 --> 2155.5
extraordinaire I mean

2152.38 --> 2157.48
that's we're talking about

2155.5 --> 2160.24
or also known as

2157.48 --> 2163.2400000000002
take the Polaris challenge you coward

2160.24 --> 2163.24
Hawkins

2170.64 --> 2176.44
not sure the point of why he said it but

2173.98 --> 2179.02
you called it well he said it because he

2176.44 --> 2181.54
wanted me to go off track and try to

2179.02 --> 2184.859
Google it so it was a sophisticated

2181.54 --> 2188.46
level of disruption

2184.859 --> 2191.98
aimed at autistic people it's literally

2188.46 --> 2195.16
autistic people type disruption tactics

2191.98 --> 2197.32
it's pure disruption I mean that guy

2195.16 --> 2200.8799999999997
might be CIA

2197.32 --> 2200.88
might be a CIA sock

2201.76 --> 2206.579
just to disrupt you

2203.8 --> 2206.579
how would you know

2208.359 --> 2213.339
it's disrupting

2210.88 --> 2214.96
it's drawing attention to people that

2213.339 --> 2216.4
typically would be associated with

2214.96 --> 2219.579
autistic

2216.4 --> 2222.339
I have some of that so they try that on

2219.579 --> 2226.98
me and it actually does work

2222.339 --> 2226.98
then again I'm also an end path

2227.38 --> 2234.28
so I actually see what is happening

2230.5 --> 2237.4
before it happens yes

2234.28 --> 2240.28
and that's how I call out exactly what

2237.4 --> 2245.8
is happening knowing what it is before

2240.28 --> 2245.8
I've even tested it yes telepathy

2246.099 --> 2249.06
effectively

2249.76 --> 2252.889
[Music]

2253.119 --> 2259.1400000000003
I think it may be someone in your street

right so yeah and if you got anything

2370.119 --> 2375.579

2373.66 --> 2377.2
Google it and then shut up for five

2375.579 --> 2379.6800000000003
minutes straight

2377.2 --> 2379.68
anything

2379.96 --> 2386.52
somebody brought up that David Wise went

2382.78 --> 2386.52
on some baller Channel and then

2386.68 --> 2391.2999999999997
add a debate I mean he does do that sort

2389.079 --> 2393.1600000000003
of thing

2391.3 --> 2396.9
and both

2393.16 --> 2399.8799999999997
ball buster flat earthers I mean

2396.9 --> 2401.8
globuster flat earthers and anti-flat

2399.88 --> 2405.3
earthers were in the chat there thanks

2401.8 --> 2405.3
for sharing that BJC net

2406.3 --> 2409.38
anything else

2424.78 --> 2427.92
oh yeah

2459.22 --> 2463.54
ah

2461.14 --> 2467.16
yeah flutter sage no that's not a dumb

2463.54 --> 2467.16
question at all why would you say that

2467.92 --> 2475.359
no halfer sign formula is kind of tough

2473.02 --> 2478.0
it was very tough for I mean I

2475.359 --> 2480.72
understand what it is

2478.0 --> 2480.72
but

2480.94 --> 2485.38
it's like something it's a bit hard to

2483.76 --> 2486.96
stick

2485.38 --> 2489.46
took like

2486.96 --> 2492.3
constant exposure over at the Flat Earth

2489.46 --> 2496.359
debate has helped me basically anchor in

2492.3 --> 2500.32
Anchor it in my knowledge but what it is

2496.359 --> 2503.02
is a mathematical system a formula an

2500.32 --> 2504.28
exact formula

2503.02 --> 2508.119
foreign

2504.28 --> 2510.94
that transforms the flat the measured

2508.119 --> 2512.32
flat plane data

2510.94 --> 2514.42
into

2512.32 --> 2517.8900000000003
the globe Earth

2514.42 --> 2519.46
so it is basically a mathematical

2517.89 --> 2522.64
[Music]

2519.46 --> 2524.8
formula that yeah that transforms a flat

2522.64 --> 2527.6189999999997
plane into a globe

2524.8 --> 2530.32
mathematically

2527.619 --> 2533.26
in a singular formula and that's what it

2530.32 --> 2536.8
is it's a it's not like a really basic

2533.26 --> 2539.0400000000004
formula it's pretty complicated I think

2536.8 --> 2539.04
foreign

2550.54 --> 2555.46
yeah ripping down kovic related nonsense

2553.3 --> 2558.099
[ __ ] yeah

2555.46 --> 2562.56
totally

2558.099 --> 2562.56
there is no oh my God the kuma virus

2563.2 --> 2567.339
yeah

2564.52 --> 2571.32
that's exactly what it does the kumu

2567.339 --> 2571.32
virus it's exactly what it does

2580.0 --> 2583.839
first thing you heard when you came on

2582.16 --> 2586.2999999999997
yeah I bet

2583.839 --> 2588.52
but just saying there is no formula that

2586.3 --> 2591.1600000000003
does that that's just wrong there is

2588.52 --> 2595.2
it's the hover sign formula

2591.16 --> 2595.2
that is what it does a Kuma virus

2595.3 --> 2602.02
or or do you have an alternative

2598.44 --> 2604.38
explanation for what it does did you

2602.02 --> 2604.38
devise

2607.599 --> 2614.52
if you devised an alternative meaning an

2611.2 --> 2614.52
application for it

2615.4 --> 2619.2000000000003
a steamy traveler could see you

2625.24 --> 2630.2799999999997
you're going to just leave it like that

2627.22 --> 2634.7799999999997
no that's not what you guys

2630.28 --> 2634.78
it's spherical trait

2635.56 --> 2639.18
yeah it's a it's a mathematical

2637.48 --> 2641.8
procedure

2639.18 --> 2643.96
presupposing a sphere

2641.8 --> 2646.8
yes

2643.96 --> 2646.8
I know

2648.76 --> 2654.7000000000003
that doesn't negate

2651.28 --> 2656.2000000000003
that it transforms a flat plane into a

2654.7 --> 2659.14
sphere

2656.2 --> 2661.5989999999997
mathematically

2659.14 --> 2665.8799999999997
nothing presupposed no it's a

2661.599 --> 2665.88
mathematical transformation formula

2665.92 --> 2671.56
it's not part of a postulate it's just

2669.04 --> 2675.819
math I know

2671.56 --> 2679.119
but it does literally do that though

2675.819 --> 2681.64
it does literally transform

2679.119 --> 2685.3
measure data

2681.64 --> 2687.04
from a flat plane into a globe that's

2685.3 --> 2689.619
what it mathematically does it doesn't

2687.04 --> 2692.079
presuppose anything about it it's just a

2689.619 --> 2694.44
mathematical procedure and that is what

2692.079 --> 2694.44
it does

2721.9 --> 2723.9
um

2733.92 --> 2738.04
I'll show it what the [ __ ] are you

2736.66 --> 2740.819
talking about it Google how are you

2738.04 --> 2740.819
gonna even do that

2743.44 --> 2748.839
I don't need to be shown anything I know

2746.319 --> 2752.44
what it does

2748.839 --> 2755.22
it's been discussed elaborately on the

2752.44 --> 2755.2200000000003
flatter of the day

2758.5 --> 2764.4
you don't need to tell me what it does a

2761.56 --> 2764.4
kumu virus

2764.79 --> 2773.68
[Music]

2771.339 --> 2776.7599999999998
maybe you should save it for the flatter

2773.68 --> 2776.7599999999998
debates Jab

2777.04 --> 2779.16
thank you

2779.33 --> 2782.449
[Music]

2798.46 --> 2803.609
yeah Tony waves again

2800.32 --> 2803.6090000000004
[Music]

2813.16 --> 2815.46
foreign

2822.89 --> 2828.54
[Music]

2837.22 --> 2843.2799999999997
I think my landlord might have a meeting

2840.16 --> 2845.92
planned right now

2843.28 --> 2850.8590000000004
not great

2845.92 --> 2850.859
middle of my show anyway we'll see

2852.099 --> 2856.1800000000003
you might also be here to just install

2854.02 --> 2859.38
the new uh

2856.18 --> 2859.3799999999997
vent for the kitchen

2870.64 --> 2876.5789999999997
pretty oh my God I love that I I'm not

2874.599 --> 2878.76
even gonna address that [ __ ] at this

2876.579 --> 2878.76
point

2880.96 --> 2883.14
thank you

2892.15 --> 2896.76
[Music]

2893.44 --> 2896.76
hello by the way Cleary

2915.24 --> 2920.75
oh yeah

2917.22 --> 2920.75
[Music]

2946.839 --> 2951.16
right okay so the meeting apparently is

2949.66 --> 2953.0789999999997
right now

2951.16 --> 2954.94
so I guess I'm gonna have to round out

right so yeah I'll try to be back on the

2963.339 --> 2967.2999999999997
Flat Earth debates but I guess this is

2964.96 --> 2970.0
gonna be a very short show

2967.3 --> 2973.54
only 50 minutes

2970.0 --> 2976.18
but anyway thanks everyone for coming

2973.54 --> 2979.9

going to be 2 p.m Amsterdam time and I'm

3015.839 --> 3019.0789999999997
gonna join the Flat Earth debates

3017.22 --> 3022.4399999999996
somewhere

3019.079 --> 3025.2000000000003
