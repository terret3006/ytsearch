100.74 --> 106.56
I have to do it

102.659 --> 108.72
all right anyway whether today's really

106.56 --> 111.899
turned around it's

108.72 --> 113.28
it's gotten very cloudy very windy and

111.899 --> 116.64
there's rain

113.28 --> 118.7
sometimes not right now

116.64 --> 121.619
there was earlier

118.7 --> 123.479
and all throughout the night but yeah

121.619 --> 125.88
it's not hard rain or anything it's not

123.479 --> 129.179
like it's a serious storm

125.88 --> 132.78
I haven't seen any lightning

129.179 --> 135.48
or maybe some like really in a distance

132.78 --> 138.14000000000001
just like once or twice but without even

135.48 --> 138.14
hearing Thunder

138.42 --> 145.16
uh yeah it's not

140.52 --> 145.16
summer seems like it's over now

147.08 --> 152.70000000000002
I was just watching Owen Benjamin from

150.239 --> 154.62
yesterday night and holy [ __ ] and all

152.7 --> 155.94
that certainly feels like the summer was

154.62 --> 160.08
over

155.94 --> 163.07999999999998
it's a gigantic bickering Fest

160.08 --> 163.08
unbelievable

164.879 --> 168.66
uh

166.14 --> 171.83999999999997
I know yeah I still remember that Urban

168.66 --> 174.29999999999998
Farmer from very early d-life days

171.84 --> 176.879
I used to be subscribed to him for a bit

174.3 --> 178.62
on the life but he didn't really do live

176.879 --> 182.76
streams anymore

178.62 --> 187.58
there at least but holy [ __ ] that guy

182.76 --> 187.57999999999998
was just gamma spazzing like

188.519 --> 191.48000000000002
unbelievable

193.56 --> 198.12
and it was just like Jimbo just like

196.08 --> 200.459
Jimbo

198.12 --> 203.459
really bizarre

200.459 --> 205.31900000000002
but uh yeah at least

203.459 --> 208.379
there was a stream

205.319 --> 210.599
anyway hello Oz first in chat Richard G

208.379 --> 214.2
good to see you

210.599 --> 217.2
it is Wednesday the 13th of September

214.2 --> 217.2
2023

219.9 --> 223.68
it's the end of summer let's carry the

222.0 --> 226.379
somewhere with us

223.68 --> 227.58
right I modified the title yesterday a

226.379 --> 229.44
bit

227.58 --> 231.78
didn't really think that the whole safe

229.44 --> 235.159
thing was like a

231.78 --> 235.159
a main point really

235.92 --> 239.94
and then I remember wait I didn't I talk

238.08 --> 241.92000000000002
about how to carry the summer with you

239.94 --> 243.959
so I thought that's a much better

241.92 --> 246.72
primary title

243.959 --> 250.4
and just add safes are not safe from US

246.72 --> 250.4
government that was enough

252.72 --> 256.44
right I'm not sure what I'm gonna do

254.939 --> 259.56
today

256.44 --> 263.299
I'm gonna eat back a little

259.56 --> 263.299
I would really like to have

263.759 --> 269.639
at minimum 10 euros

267.18 --> 271.86
preferably 30 and of course more is

269.639 --> 273.90000000000003
always better but

271.86 --> 276.36
yeah

273.9 --> 277.88
told you this was gonna happen had a

276.36 --> 281.3
great weekend though right

277.88 --> 281.3
[Music]

281.4 --> 286.4
weekend was fantastic the last few shows

283.74 --> 286.40000000000003
have been great

286.919 --> 292.85999999999996
bit short but I mean yeah

290.16 --> 294.78000000000003
last week was just an anomaly with

292.86 --> 297.12
Nathan not being there and me suddenly

294.78 --> 299.53999999999996
doing more than two hour shows it was

297.12 --> 299.54
fun though

301.44 --> 305.4
new chat filter

304.139 --> 308.6
what

305.4 --> 308.59999999999997
hello fibroids

308.94 --> 312.139
don't know what you're talking about

314.16 --> 318.8
I did not see new chat filter as a

316.62 --> 318.8
message

326.46 --> 332.52
did I turn up

328.68 --> 337.039
support your Lo what

332.52 --> 337.039
no but you can have memberships

337.5 --> 342.36
I have not turned on super chats no

339.72 --> 343.97900000000004
because well if people send money there

342.36 --> 345.90000000000003
then I don't get it

343.979 --> 348.0
so it doesn't really seem that much

345.9 --> 350.15999999999997
worth it

348.0 --> 352.44
I actually want to receive the support

350.16 --> 355.52000000000004
that I get

352.44 --> 355.52
you know

357.78 --> 362.39
so please choose PayPal

360.6 --> 365.1
we've got it also what

362.39 --> 367.979
[Music]

365.1 --> 372.139
okay I got there's something going on

367.979 --> 372.139
you guys are saying I will check out

375.539 --> 381.74
I will check out the live stream page

378.66 --> 381.74
let's see if there's something

392.28 --> 394.75899999999996
just

400.8 --> 405.479
hmm

403.28 --> 408.29999999999995
uh well

405.479 --> 411.3
doesn't seem like I have like any kind

408.3 --> 415.88
of chat filter on

411.3 --> 415.88
doesn't say in video details at least

417.24 --> 424.22
Maybe YouTube Studio check out like

421.039 --> 424.21999999999997
the settings

430.56 --> 433.46
what the [ __ ]

443.52 --> 451.21999999999997
what what the hell is wrong with it

446.759 --> 451.22
what the [ __ ] where's my moderator list

453.96 --> 459.91999999999996
what the hell is this

456.7 --> 459.92
[Music]

465.9 --> 469.58
something's like changed

471.84 --> 476.039
but this can't be right

473.94 --> 479.0
there's an error

476.039 --> 482.099
because literally the list of of

479.0 --> 484.8
moderators and blocked people are gone

482.099 --> 487.199
but they can be gone because your guys

484.8 --> 488.88
are literally using wrenches so this

487.199 --> 490.56
makes no sense

488.88 --> 493.039
this is just weird

490.56 --> 493.039
hey

493.319 --> 495.97900000000004
ah

496.08 --> 502.68

because it's part of the membership

516.3 --> 523.3389999999999
system

518.64 --> 523.3389999999999
thank you for being a member by the way

544.2 --> 548.399
let's see if some old he saves wow okay

546.779 --> 551.959
I didn't know that seeking star water

548.399 --> 551.959
that's that's really messed up

552.12 --> 554.3
foreign

557.88 --> 565.399
click the three lines remain

562.14 --> 565.399
what three lines

574.44 --> 580.74
well okay anyway hello

577.1 --> 582.12
fiber out seeking star water

580.74 --> 583.8
Bank

582.12 --> 586.82
LSG

583.8 --> 586.8199999999999
good to see you guys

591.68 --> 596.6999999999999
the top beside the scissors I don't know

594.66 --> 599.899
what you're talking about dude I have no

596.7 --> 599.899
idea what you're talking about

605.7 --> 608.779
what scissors

612.839 --> 618.48
maybe it's a mobile that could very well

615.24 --> 620.94
be I'm not seeing any scissors so

618.48 --> 624.6
and they would do weird [ __ ] with the

620.94 --> 627.48
mobiles all the time right you'll get

624.6 --> 630.839
those label warning labels about

627.48 --> 632.88
medical misinformation or Flat Earth

630.839 --> 635.4590000000001
misinformation nonsense so yeah maybe

632.88 --> 638.58
they just updated that

635.459 --> 641.4799999999999
and you're getting the latest [ __ ] or

638.58 --> 641.48
it's even buggy

645.18 --> 647.779
hmm

651.24 --> 656.84
[Music]

670.459 --> 675.7399999999999
you know this is that the video game

672.899 --> 675.74
that you're talking about

676.86 --> 679.86
right

685.14 --> 687.56
okay

688.92 --> 693.8389999999999
yeah I'm not doing that video game I'm

691.68 --> 696.3199999999999
not really looking for new video games

693.839 --> 696.32
at all

707.339 --> 709.94
hmm

714.72 --> 718.76
hey Dr Whitaker good to see you

721.38 --> 725.579
right but I was thinking about it that

723.66 --> 728.04
is very sudden

725.579 --> 729.8389999999999
what happened there with om Benjamin and

728.04 --> 731.3389999999999
I do think that I was thinking about

729.839 --> 733.74
seasons

731.339 --> 735.6600000000001
and that it's very logical that right

733.74 --> 738.42
after the summer ends that all the

735.66 --> 739.92
gamma's go berserk everywhere it's

738.42 --> 742.019
logical

739.92 --> 744.779
right they can't carry the summer with

742.019 --> 747.72
them they can only feed off it while it

744.779 --> 750.0
lasts and they can't keep it inside and

747.72 --> 753.26
so then they basically start attacking

750.0 --> 753.26
everybody that can

757.26 --> 763.98
and it also makes sense with like fruits

761.339 --> 765.839
right some are fruits it all grows then

763.98 --> 769.139
summer ends then it's the Harvest Time

765.839 --> 771.7790000000001
well that's where the darkness through

769.139 --> 774.54
people and especially through Gammas

771.779 --> 776.7
comes in to like oh quickly let's loot

774.54 --> 780.139
it before it's all gone

776.7 --> 780.139
that sort of behavior

780.48 --> 784.8000000000001
so there might yeah I'm predicting based

783.12 --> 786.839
on this one thing that there might be a

784.8 --> 789.12
lot of gamma waves that are certainly

786.839 --> 791.3000000000001
going to hit like fed and maybe my chat

789.12 --> 791.3
too

794.94 --> 798.7790000000001
so that's an interesting thought I got

796.8 --> 800.959
out of watching that just before the

798.779 --> 800.959
show

804.959 --> 809.3389999999999
right yeah I'm really not stocked up

807.54 --> 811.139
today by the way

809.339 --> 813.5400000000001
I mean this weather is definitely not

811.139 --> 815.94
Gusto energy drink weather

813.54 --> 818.279
and I had a really big well not really

815.94 --> 821.519
big I just had a

818.279 --> 825.18
I had a hamburger yesterday

821.519 --> 828.0
which was pretty great even this is the

825.18 --> 832.04
weird part I used gravy

828.0 --> 832.04
because I recycle my gravy

832.98 --> 837.1800000000001
and this one like

834.899 --> 840.36
I hadn't used that

837.18 --> 842.04
in like at least a year

840.36 --> 845.5790000000001
and it was almost like kind of nervous

842.04 --> 848.3389999999999
like is that still good

845.579 --> 850.3199999999999
I hope it's not rotten or anything but I

848.339 --> 852.6
mean I I used it

850.32 --> 855.36
and I mean that gravy literally sat

852.6 --> 857.16
there not in the fridge I did I don't

855.36 --> 859.74
keep it in the fridge I just keep it in

857.16 --> 862.019
the in the cabinet with a lid on it

859.74 --> 866.7
right

862.019 --> 870.18
and it was great it was it's like wow

866.7 --> 872.519
it really it really is just you just

870.18 --> 875.18
can't keep it you can just keep it for a

872.519 --> 875.18
very long time

875.82 --> 879.2600000000001
it's like

877.26 --> 882.6
hamburger

879.26 --> 885.42
grease based on olive oil like

882.6 --> 887.82
hamburgers baked in olive oil like for a

885.42 --> 890.459
lot and then eventually like the

887.82 --> 892.74
hamburger grease just kind of like

890.459 --> 895.3199999999999
stops it from being liquid and then it

892.74 --> 897.48
just becomes hamburger Grease

895.32 --> 900.0
and that's really great to make your

897.48 --> 902.5790000000001
hamburgers in

900.0 --> 904.86
it really is and I also like baked

902.579 --> 907.68
onions in that and then afterward I

904.86 --> 908.88
basically sift it put it back in the

907.68 --> 911.0999999999999
glass

908.88 --> 913.26
put a lid back on and then put it in the

911.1 --> 914.519
club in the in the cabinet and it works

913.26 --> 917.3389999999999
great

914.519 --> 919.8
and hamburgers are well despite the

917.339 --> 921.7790000000001
hamburgers having become a lot more

919.8 --> 924.3
expensive it has doubled in price since

921.779 --> 926.579
like two years ago

924.3 --> 929.3389999999999
or three years ago but

926.579 --> 930.899
it is relatively still cheap

929.339 --> 934.1990000000001
as a meal

930.899 --> 938.18
and get two meals out of it

934.199 --> 938.18
all I need is some slices of bread

939.3 --> 946.8199999999999
uh an onion and I'll always have those

942.899 --> 946.82
because I use them for French fries

947.04 --> 950.54
peanut uh

950.699 --> 956.88
peanut sauce and yeah uh

954.899 --> 958.62
lettuce

956.88 --> 960.36
tomato

958.62 --> 963.36
chili pepper

960.36 --> 964.5
or cut and then yeah that with some

963.36 --> 966.6
sauces

964.5 --> 967.98
and you got a hamburger and it's a great

966.6 --> 970.1990000000001
meal

967.98 --> 972.9590000000001
but it is like much

970.199 --> 974.76
more compounded always than you I think

972.959 --> 977.88
because it's like yeah it's a hamburger

974.76 --> 980.8199999999999
but I mean it really feels it's like

977.88 --> 982.38
basically a big meal and sometimes you

980.82 --> 984.36
forget that and it's like oh I ate

982.38 --> 986.399
something before and I don't like yeah

984.36 --> 987.779
not enough I want I'm gonna eat that

986.399 --> 991.139
hamburger and then I eat the hamburger

987.779 --> 994.76
and I get halfway I'm like uh

991.139 --> 997.44
I'm full crap

994.76 --> 1000.74
that did not happen yesterday since I

997.44 --> 1003.139
basically only ate lunch

1000.74 --> 1005.779
beside that

1003.139 --> 1009.5790000000001
right so I'm feel feeling pretty

1005.779 --> 1009.579
nourished still

1011.36 --> 1017.66
not a lot but wish I was rich

1014.66 --> 1020.06
well be careful what you wish for

1017.66 --> 1024.02
[Music]

1020.06 --> 1028.3999999999999
I would just wish that I got enough

1024.02 --> 1032.799
I just wish that I got like enough

1028.4 --> 1032.799
like enough for what I need

1035.419 --> 1039.98
because Rich technically would be more

1037.88 --> 1043.0
than you need and that's usually not

1039.98 --> 1043.0
great for your spirit

1043.64 --> 1048.74
but uh

1045.5 --> 1051.08
yeah talking about which I will really

1048.74 --> 1054.799
I am gonna demand basically a PayPal

1051.08 --> 1056.6
today I haven't had one since

1054.799 --> 1060.559
yeah the weekend

1056.6 --> 1062.48
and I do need it because I am broke

1060.559 --> 1065.36
I need some money

1062.48 --> 1068.1200000000001
to yeah keep going or I'm literally yeah

1065.36 --> 1069.32
I've I've run out of smokes I got some

1068.12 --> 1071.4799999999998
food

1069.32 --> 1074.78
can make it for a while but I'm running

1071.48 --> 1077.14
I've run out of smoke so I don't like

1074.78 --> 1077.1399999999999
that

1083.419 --> 1088.8200000000002
it's always a big hassle when that

1085.76 --> 1092.419
happens so I'd prefer to be able to well

1088.82 --> 1095.6
just continue doing that

1092.419 --> 1097.7
sent you 10 bucks oh

1095.6 --> 1100.4189999999999
okay five routes

1097.7 --> 1100.419
that's awesome

1105.98 --> 1111.52
yeah that's awesome man I got it

1108.98 --> 1111.52
okay

1113.0 --> 1116.86
so there will be a show tomorrow

1120.919 --> 1125.66
if you wish to prevent more e-bagging

1124.52 --> 1128.6
from

1125.66 --> 1131.179
taking place during my live shows then

1128.6 --> 1134.539
the more I get

1131.179 --> 1136.76
the longer I can hold it off

1134.539 --> 1139.7
but yeah this will I will do a show

1136.76 --> 1142.22
tomorrow thanks to that PayPal five Road

1139.7 --> 1144.4
thank you very much

1142.22 --> 1144.4
okay

1156.38 --> 1158.919
right

1159.679 --> 1164.74
what else

1161.84 --> 1164.74
can I talk about

1167.12 --> 1170.12
uh

1173.539 --> 1178.6
yeah I'm not really doing a lot of dream

1175.52 --> 1178.6
rocking recently

1179.78 --> 1183.86
I don't know why

1181.88 --> 1187.4
it really worked great during the summer

1183.86 --> 1189.4399999999998
it was just like every time I get every

1187.4 --> 1191.8400000000001
ideas and then in the night as soon as

1189.44 --> 1194.98
it cooled off more like the idea is

1191.84 --> 1194.98
really get in there

1195.08 --> 1199.52
I'm already like sort of like

1197.0 --> 1203.12
spiritually projected on the next day

1199.52 --> 1208.059
and I even literally do that during my

1203.12 --> 1208.059
before bed prayer the technique

1210.74 --> 1216.1
but yeah I don't know

1213.44 --> 1216.1000000000001
yes

1219.86 --> 1223.9599999999998
I guess it comes and goes and waves

1236.539 --> 1242.72
right what anyway I said chat stuck

1240.62 --> 1244.82
damn it

1242.72 --> 1247.46
I mean this is like the

1244.82 --> 1249.2
15th time I had to refresh the YouTube

1247.46 --> 1252.64
page

1249.2 --> 1252.64
this keeps getting stuck

1261.5 --> 1265.539
all right so what can I talk about today

1281.419 --> 1286.8200000000002
all right okay Owen Troyer from Infowars

1284.78 --> 1291.02
went to jail because of some stupid

1286.82 --> 1293.6
trials [ __ ] according to January 6 stuff

1291.02 --> 1295.76
annoying

1293.6 --> 1297.02
wasn't that long though but it's still

1295.76 --> 1300.22
like

1297.02 --> 1300.22
still long enough

1300.62 --> 1305.829
[Music]

1309.919 --> 1315.5
like a couple of months or something

1312.5 --> 1316.82
ridiculous like what anyway that

1315.5 --> 1319.34
happened

1316.82 --> 1322.58
uh

1319.34 --> 1324.5
was all over inforce yesterday

1322.58 --> 1327.22
um

1324.5 --> 1327.22
that's what else

1337.9 --> 1343.1000000000001
uh yeah something I talked about over

1341.179 --> 1347.659
the weekends a while ago never got to

1343.1 --> 1350.8999999999999
that GTI update like the boss is trying

1347.659 --> 1353.8400000000001
to like standardize the

1350.9 --> 1356.96
usdts

1353.84 --> 1360.559
to like he's attempting now to literally

1356.96 --> 1362.6000000000001
integrate those like within the GTI

1360.559 --> 1365.8999999999999
sit in our system

1362.6 --> 1368.26
so that it's not like clumsy and slow

1365.9 --> 1368.26
anymore

1369.02 --> 1374.72
which is now the situation remember that

1371.36 --> 1376.4599999999998
like oh it gets some usdt and then you

1374.72 --> 1380.24
basically combine it with some other

1376.46 --> 1382.58
stuff and then you can you with the GT I

1380.24 --> 1384.799
currency and then you

1382.58 --> 1387.3799999999999
can transform that but it takes a long

1384.799 --> 1389.78
time well

1387.38 --> 1393.2
he's always trying to basically like

1389.78 --> 1395.48
transform GTI further to become more

1393.2 --> 1397.94
effective and that's now in the plan so

1395.48 --> 1400.059
that's interesting

1397.94 --> 1403.3400000000001
because

1400.059 --> 1405.6789999999999
usdt is considered a stable coin that

1403.34 --> 1406.6999999999998
doesn't fluctuate a lot like Bitcoin or

1405.679 --> 1409.159
anything

1406.7 --> 1412.5800000000002
and that's what they're doing so okay

1409.159 --> 1415.5200000000002
cool that means that maybe in in a

1412.58 --> 1418.28
couple of months or maybe

1415.52 --> 1421.1
maybe longer

1418.28 --> 1423.799
like there will just be usdt available

1421.1 --> 1426.86
that you could like directly trade it or

1423.799 --> 1430.22
something that would be interesting

1426.86 --> 1433.82
right because they have a lot of stuff

1430.22 --> 1438.159
like Unlimited Supply of GTI coin and

1433.82 --> 1440.84
stuff they have a lot of money sources

1438.159 --> 1444.159
and they could basically just buy up a

1440.84 --> 1444.1589999999999
huge one of usdt

1444.44 --> 1453.98
because well then you can like basically

1449.299 --> 1456.86
pump that in the GTI Inner Circle system

1453.98 --> 1460.4
so that all the jdi participants don't

1456.86 --> 1462.9189999999999
have to wait so long to build it up

1460.4 --> 1465.2
right so I really yeah looking forward

1462.919 --> 1467.179
to that happening at some point which

1465.2 --> 1471.38
would really open up the gates I mean

1467.179 --> 1473.7800000000002
GTI is like continually just

1471.38 --> 1476.7800000000002
spouting up

1473.78 --> 1478.22
the crypto stuff that they produce like

1476.78 --> 1482.1789999999999
plenty

1478.22 --> 1485.659
like I'm busy on a daily basis like

1482.179 --> 1487.22
designated designating the stuff that

1485.659 --> 1489.44
comes out of there

1487.22 --> 1491.78
because there's a lot coming out and I

1489.44 --> 1495.64
well I have built it up over like seven

1491.78 --> 1495.6399999999999
years so you know

1496.28 --> 1500.44
right hey good to see you

1502.34 --> 1505.299
so there's that

1511.64 --> 1513.8200000000002
foreign

1539.48 --> 1544.96
Europe is getting like really messed up

1542.419 --> 1544.96
by the way

1545.059 --> 1549.5
they're just like trying to initiate

1547.46 --> 1550.88
like a Communist Revolution here almost

1549.5 --> 1554.2
it seems

1550.88 --> 1554.2
it's really messed up

1561.26 --> 1566.48
they're like building a system where

1563.059 --> 1568.279
just on the whim of any emergency they

1566.48 --> 1571.94
can literally like take your property

1568.279 --> 1574.94
now here like of anybody like that's

1571.94 --> 1576.5
literally communist China policy

1574.94 --> 1579.5
that's what they're trying to do other

1576.5 --> 1581.9
guys whatever emergency which includes

1579.5 --> 1583.72
fake emergencies that they use all the

1581.9 --> 1587.539
time so that's

1583.72 --> 1590.24
unnerving I predict that either Europe

1587.539 --> 1592.1589999999999
will go into like full Crackdown full

1590.24 --> 1595.179
Communist Revolution which is going to

1592.159 --> 1595.179
be super [ __ ] up

1596.919 --> 1601.94
or

1598.82 --> 1604.1589999999999
that Europe's gonna break up soon

1601.94 --> 1606.3200000000002
I really hope the Netherlands is gonna

1604.159 --> 1607.7
like

1606.32 --> 1610.82
get out

1607.7 --> 1613.72
and when the Netherlands does like it's

1610.82 --> 1613.72
not gonna work anymore

1620.24 --> 1624.98
low classical homeopath what are you

1622.94 --> 1628.299
talking about

1624.98 --> 1628.299
is that sarcasm

1637.4 --> 1642.38
so yeah it's looking bad and uh

1640.22 --> 1644.6000000000001
I don't know if this doesn't go in the

1642.38 --> 1647.3600000000001
right direction yeah I might disappear

1644.6 --> 1649.6999999999998
at some point and then

1647.36 --> 1653.6589999999999
you might find my name somewhere in the

1649.7 --> 1655.9
dead list of some Gulag in a decade I

1653.659 --> 1655.9
don't know

1658.88 --> 1663.919
although it's more likely you'll just

1660.98 --> 1666.679
hear about it

1663.919 --> 1668.8400000000001
through rumors because I'm not gonna be

1666.679 --> 1671.419
carried off to a cat but it's much more

1668.84 --> 1673.82
likely just

1671.419 --> 1677.0590000000002
try to

1673.82 --> 1680.24
overtake whatever soldiery would come

1677.059 --> 1682.82
and then just start it

1680.24 --> 1685.1
killing them until I'm dead which might

1682.82 --> 1689.799
be very quick but I'm definitely not

1685.1 --> 1689.799
going anywhere for any reason

1689.9 --> 1694.9
and they'll defend myself with lethal

1692.48 --> 1694.9
Force

1695.539 --> 1700.1589999999999
if necessary

1697.88 --> 1701.779
and I don't care if everything breaks

1700.159 --> 1704.24
down like oh you can't pay your rent

1701.779 --> 1705.26
anymore yeah because nobody can and I'm

1704.24 --> 1706.46
not going anywhere

1705.26 --> 1708.679
[Music]

1706.46 --> 1711.8600000000001
yeah if I certainly can't pay my rent

1708.679 --> 1715.88
anymore I'm not going anywhere

1711.86 --> 1717.9189999999999
you're gonna have to use extreme violent

1715.88 --> 1720.0200000000002
Force to try and remove me because I'm

1717.919 --> 1722.9
not going anywhere

1720.02 --> 1724.82
if you try to trick me somehow to get me

1722.9 --> 1728.5
barred out of my house

1724.82 --> 1728.5
I will break in again

1729.799 --> 1735.799
like I'm not going anywhere under any

1732.14 --> 1737.48
circumstances I this is where I am and

1735.799 --> 1740.36
this is where I'm going to be no matter

1737.48 --> 1742.34
what happens even if a [ __ ] bombs

1740.36 --> 1746.5
start blowing up the city I'm still

1742.34 --> 1746.5
gonna be here I'm not going anywhere

1755.24 --> 1757.72
what

1758.72 --> 1761.98
sourdough bread yesterday

1763.059 --> 1767.6789999999999
sounds great so you can start water

1765.14 --> 1767.679
awesome

1775.82 --> 1778.72
oh

1781.299 --> 1786.3799999999999
Curtis camera

1784.039 --> 1789.3799999999999
person I don't know who that is by the

1786.38 --> 1791.919
way at all someone buggy it's not Curtis

1789.38 --> 1791.919
Stone right

1792.14 --> 1798.159
because he was literally just on with

1794.36 --> 1798.1589999999999
Owen Benjamin yesterday apparently

1798.5 --> 1805.12
and Curtis Stone went like total gamma

1802.279 --> 1808.12
space Oh no one like

1805.12 --> 1811.8799999999999
total gamma space I mean

1808.12 --> 1816.6399999999999
way worse than a hyper triggered

1811.88 --> 1816.64
anti-flatter on on Nathan Oakleys

1816.7 --> 1822.32
way worse than that

1819.32 --> 1823.6399999999999
like complete spaz like if you've been

1822.32 --> 1826.52
physically there it would have probably

1823.64 --> 1828.3990000000001
physically assaulted Owen he was just so

1826.52 --> 1832.399
out of his [ __ ] mind

1828.399 --> 1832.399
complete spaz

1833.539 --> 1837.799
so it's a different Curtis

1835.88 --> 1839.779
Curtis started samanthalpy yeah but it

1837.799 --> 1842.3799999999999
was also about Jordan Peterson that's

1839.779 --> 1842.38
the weird thing

1850.12 --> 1859.34
you went complete ape [ __ ] because Owen

1855.5 --> 1861.62
like over that over that stuff with

1859.34 --> 1863.72
Jordan Peterson it's ridiculous like he

1861.62 --> 1867.1999999999998
said no you criticize him for everything

1863.72 --> 1869.8990000000001
that you do you're really the gamma I

1867.2 --> 1872.8990000000001
mean oh

1869.899 --> 1872.899
unbelievable

1881.059 --> 1887.36
but yet mental patient

1884.659 --> 1889.88
I can't believe he'd allow himself to do

1887.36 --> 1892.82
something like that publicly

1889.88 --> 1895.22
I mean in chats or

1892.82 --> 1898.1589999999999
Twitter or something is one thing but to

1895.22 --> 1900.76
do that on camera to face to face with

1898.159 --> 1900.7600000000002
somebody else

1902.12 --> 1906.9799999999998
that's crazy

1904.94 --> 1910.3990000000001
like even if you think you could get

1906.98 --> 1913.1
some sort of in the moment win

1910.399 --> 1917.36
socially

1913.1 --> 1919.34
like it still just makes you like nobody

1917.36 --> 1921.74
ever gonna try to be friends with you

1919.34 --> 1925.539
after that point

1921.74 --> 1927.98
cause you are a nasty nasty ass

1925.539 --> 1929.96
backstabbing gamma

1927.98 --> 1934.24
that can't take a joke

1929.96 --> 1934.24
and and it's like trying to like

1934.52 --> 1938.899
he wasn't trying to be funny he was

1936.799 --> 1941.4189999999999
trying to be humiliating

1938.899 --> 1944.299
now Owen Benjamin also gets a bit

1941.419 --> 1947.2990000000002
humiliating but he does it

1944.299 --> 1949.58
to be funny that's the difference and

1947.299 --> 1952.84
when you're literally hurt on the inside

1949.58 --> 1952.84
it doesn't work

1953.539 --> 1958.179
that's what happened with

1955.46 --> 1958.179
Curtis Stone

1958.279 --> 1964.039
he was trying to be humiliatingly funny

1961.12 --> 1966.52
towards oh it doesn't work because he

1964.039 --> 1966.52
was hurt

1967.22 --> 1972.159
and just makes you look like a gamma

1969.32 --> 1972.1589999999999
[ __ ] then

1978.74 --> 1983.779
a bunch of bad act yeah there's a bunch

1981.14 --> 1986.5
of bad Curtises

1983.779 --> 1986.5
out there

1987.679 --> 1991.88
it's it sounds like it's all part of the

1990.14 --> 1994.8200000000002
what I call the Brotherhood not so

1991.88 --> 1996.6200000000001
obvious establishment of Brotherhood

1994.82 --> 1998.36
it's like a controlled opposition

1996.62 --> 2001.0
movement

1998.36 --> 2003.4599999999998
that grafts in gammas

2001.0 --> 2005.98
so that they can

2003.46 --> 2007.779
participate in the dance of pretending

2005.98 --> 2009.58
like they are the alphas that are

2007.779 --> 2012.159
resisting

2009.58 --> 2016.12
that's the Brotherhood

2012.159 --> 2019.659
they're all grifters all of them

2016.12 --> 2023.76
all of them are grifters all of them are

2019.659 --> 2023.7600000000002
grifters all of them the entire thing

2025.899 --> 2031.4799999999998
which yeah I'm sorry it's like

2029.679 --> 2033.5800000000002
I don't like that

2031.48 --> 2038.22
I don't like that realization but it's

2033.58 --> 2041.6789999999999
true and then that means that like most

2038.22 --> 2043.98
politicians that are getting promoted at

2041.679 --> 2048.099
at Infowars

2043.98 --> 2050.679
are the Brotherhood they're grifters

2048.099 --> 2052.8990000000003
I mean they're not as [ __ ] up a

2050.679 --> 2055.2400000000002
grifter as like

2052.899 --> 2056.7999999999997
it's like the Imperium

2055.24 --> 2059.74
right

2056.8 --> 2063.5800000000004
it's a liberal Imperium they are just

2059.74 --> 2066.6389999999997
like total overt autocrats

2063.58 --> 2068.56
if they got away with it according to

2066.639 --> 2070.659
the laws they would literally for their

2068.56 --> 2073.839
own Amusement just shoot people in the

2070.659 --> 2075.399
face randomly right they would get to

2073.839 --> 2076.899
that point that's how much they care

2075.399 --> 2079.5989999999997
about the people

2076.899 --> 2082.0
but the Brotherhood are just [ __ ]

2079.599 --> 2084.159
rifters they're just to steal your hope

2082.0 --> 2086.2
it's like they're just there to feed off

2084.159 --> 2088.119
your hope it's like hope is all that's

2086.2 --> 2089.6789999999996
getting a whole bunch of people out

2088.119 --> 2091.359
there that are not very capable of

2089.679 --> 2093.099
dealing with this crazy situation in the

2091.359 --> 2095.619
United States in the world

2093.099 --> 2099.04
they just are desperate for Hope and the

2095.619 --> 2101.44
Brotherhood of grifters is just like

2099.04 --> 2103.0
give me all your everything you got all

2101.44 --> 2107.339
your money everything and I will give

2103.0 --> 2107.339
you that that little line of Hope

2107.92 --> 2110.98
and a sort of idea that we could

2109.72 --> 2113.859
overcome it

2110.98 --> 2115.96
When anybody in there anybody in there

2113.859 --> 2118.359
that gets power just immediately

2115.96 --> 2121.839
switches

2118.359 --> 2124.42
they nobody ever does actually what they

2121.839 --> 2128.099
say they do when they get in power

2124.42 --> 2128.099
there none of them

2133.0 --> 2137.44
right

2134.859 --> 2139.72
and I mean half of those people still

2137.44 --> 2141.88
like oh let's have an event and they'll

2139.72 --> 2144.16
force their own followers even though

2141.88 --> 2146.38
they'll supposedly be

2144.16 --> 2148.42
against the Corvette policy and they'll

2146.38 --> 2149.92
still force their own followers to get

2148.42 --> 2151.78
shots

2149.92 --> 2154.119
when that technically wouldn't even be

2151.78 --> 2156.6400000000003
necessary

2154.119 --> 2159.1600000000003
for them they do it to make more money

2156.64 --> 2160.9
off the people that follow them and

2159.16 --> 2164.0789999999997
think that they are going to be saved by

2160.9 --> 2165.579
them it's really [ __ ] up that's the

2164.079 --> 2168.119
Brotherhood it's a Brotherhood of

2165.579 --> 2168.119
grifters

2170.74 --> 2173.2799999999997
right

2174.16 --> 2179.94
and Shiva calls that the not so obvious

2177.28 --> 2179.94
establishment

2180.579 --> 2186.94
but that's really like the top because

2183.28 --> 2190.0
it's a big system it's become very

2186.94 --> 2193.119
expanded and it's like

2190.0 --> 2195.4
if the not so obvious establishment and

2193.119 --> 2197.02
like the whole movement

2195.4 --> 2199.0
that is part of that it's just like

2197.02 --> 2200.92
synchronized without synchronized with

2199.0 --> 2201.7
our frequency with what we do do what we

2200.92 --> 2204.04
do

2201.7 --> 2206.2799999999997
become part of this that's the

2204.04 --> 2209.74
Brotherhood

2206.28 --> 2212.619
it basically converts people into like

2209.74 --> 2214.9799999999996
normalizing that grift that form of

2212.619 --> 2214.98
grift

2215.44 --> 2219.7200000000003
leeching hope

2217.06 --> 2219.72
for money

2223.18 --> 2227.14
and they're all most of them are

2224.859 --> 2229.54
connected to like the same Mega Banks

2227.14 --> 2231.8799999999997
too by the way

2229.54 --> 2235.38
I mean not just like George Soros maybe

2231.88 --> 2235.38
but like the rest

2236.32 --> 2240.9790000000003
they're all connected

2237.82 --> 2240.9790000000003
[Music]

2246.88 --> 2254.079
and like that the Brotherhood is

2250.599 --> 2257.44
happening is having this influence

2254.079 --> 2259.2400000000002
it's corrupting everybody or a lot of

2257.44 --> 2261.76
people it's very hard to not get

2259.24 --> 2264.22
corrupted when you're like I want to

2261.76 --> 2266.98
grow I got quality I want to grow it's

2264.22 --> 2268.9599999999996
very hard to like yeah of course you're

2266.98 --> 2272.82
going to oppose like

2268.96 --> 2272.82
crazy liberal Imperium

2272.92 --> 2277.78
all right the globalists the liberal

2275.8 --> 2280.02
Imperium would be a better word for it

2277.78 --> 2280.02
really

2280.18 --> 2287.02
but then like yeah then you get the

2284.2 --> 2288.2799999999997
supposed right wing or whatever the

2287.02 --> 2290.02
other side

2288.28 --> 2292.9
the Brotherhood

2290.02 --> 2294.4
and they while they're there they give a

2292.9 --> 2296.6800000000003
little bit of Hope but they also like

2294.4 --> 2299.28
normalize just this corrupted way of

2296.68 --> 2299.2799999999997
doing things

2300.16 --> 2306.339
and set that example and everybody is

2303.579 --> 2308.82
just like copying that [ __ ] they can't

2306.339 --> 2308.82
help it

2309.099 --> 2315.78
it's like everybody eventually they want

2311.619 --> 2315.78
in it's like I want a chance to

2317.02 --> 2322.66
to like still grow and become great

2320.26 --> 2325.2400000000002
despite what's going on despite the

2322.66 --> 2326.6189999999997
liberal Imperium having control like

2325.24 --> 2329.2599999999998
that

2326.619 --> 2332.04
but it corrupts you it turns you into a

2329.26 --> 2332.0400000000004
[ __ ] gamma

2338.14 --> 2343.359
right because you will like do whatever

2340.72 --> 2346.8999999999996
you think is necessary while on that

2343.359 --> 2349.66
road trying to grow like that

2346.9 --> 2351.88
and you will try to keep justifying it

2349.66 --> 2353.2
so there's like all these bad things

2351.88 --> 2354.82
you're now doing that you have to

2353.2 --> 2356.68
justify and then

2354.82 --> 2358.0
you're going to end up like a gamma

2356.68 --> 2360.52
projecting

2358.0 --> 2362.26
like attacking people over whatever you

2360.52 --> 2365.52
think is wrong about what they do when

2362.26 --> 2365.5200000000004
you do that wrong too

2371.02 --> 2373.98
it doesn't work

2374.2 --> 2379.66
you can't become part of that system to

2377.74 --> 2381.8799999999997
fight the system

2379.66 --> 2384.0989999999997
it is the system it's the not so

2381.88 --> 2386.46
obviously not so obvious establishment

2384.099 --> 2386.46
system

2386.5 --> 2392.56
it's the Brotherhood of grifters

2389.02 --> 2396.579
right so basically that's the new real

2392.56 --> 2399.2799999999997
Spirit of the right wing versus the left

2396.579 --> 2401.76
the the liberal Imperium which is the

2399.28 --> 2401.76
left wing

2406.54 --> 2411.48
neither of them can can fix anything

2411.94 --> 2417.099
although yeah I mean

2414.88 --> 2419.5
who knows if the Brotherhood really

2417.099 --> 2421.7400000000002
takes power then who knows what would

2419.5 --> 2421.74
happen

2423.28 --> 2429.099
probably a whole bunch of grifting it's

2426.579 --> 2431.8
like oh we're free like we're gonna open

2429.099 --> 2433.839
the gates but guess who's gonna be right

2431.8 --> 2435.1600000000003
there to scoop it all up

2433.839 --> 2437.82
yeah

2435.16 --> 2437.8199999999997
the Brotherhood

2437.98 --> 2442.42
and they'll just like say oh yeah we're

2440.02 --> 2444.7599999999998
just being capitalist yeah we just stole

2442.42 --> 2448.06
everything when it became free again

2444.76 --> 2451.78
yeah we're capitalist now now you have

2448.06 --> 2455.2599999999998
to do what I what we say because we're

2451.78 --> 2458.46
we're the Imperium now

2455.26 --> 2458.46
and that's what would happen

2461.02 --> 2464.38
that a whole bunch of people wouldn't

2462.579 --> 2467.6800000000003
even realize that because they'll just

2464.38 --> 2470.32
think that oh we finally won it's over

2467.68 --> 2472.18
and they'll just like completely try to

2470.32 --> 2476.2200000000003
forget about it

2472.18 --> 2476.22
become even more automated

2479.2 --> 2483.96
more easily walk into new traps again

2486.339 --> 2492.52
is anybody gonna say anything

2489.7 --> 2494.6189999999997
I'm talking for freaking 10 minutes or

2492.52 --> 2495.94
is this the stupid ass chat getting

2494.619 --> 2498.96
stuck again

2495.94 --> 2498.96
going on here

2499.18 --> 2505.2599999999998
no no just nobody said anything for 10

2502.359 --> 2505.2599999999998
minutes straight great

2506.55 --> 2509.679
[Music]

2523.11 --> 2526.7290000000003
[Music]

2529.72 --> 2531.8999999999996
foreign

2533.76 --> 2540.1800000000003
[Music]

2536.5 --> 2540.18
I got a title

2555.64 --> 2560.0789999999997
watching slow mo control what what do

2558.4 --> 2561.28
you mean watching slow mo control the

2560.079 --> 2563.7400000000002
chat

2561.28 --> 2566.26
how so

2563.74 --> 2569.859
are there people popping up

2566.26 --> 2571.78
that I'm not seeing or something

2569.859 --> 2574.02
hello Supreme knowing good to see you by

2571.78 --> 2574.02
the way

2574.839 --> 2579.94
hey drunken bullet 4-1-1 good to see you

2577.599 --> 2582.3
it's been a while what did you miss yeah

2579.94 --> 2582.3
a lot

2582.76 --> 2586.6600000000003
I mean you missed the bear chest

2584.44 --> 2588.88
challenge and everything and

2586.66 --> 2590.74
a whole bunch of fractal diving you

2588.88 --> 2594.4
missed probably

2590.74 --> 2596.9199999999996
uh Darth getting on with me

2594.4 --> 2599.6800000000003
unlike the longest early bird show to

2596.92 --> 2601.359
the ever and his first appearance like a

2599.68 --> 2604.72
three hour straight

2601.359 --> 2607.68
probably missed that

2604.72 --> 2607.68
from last week

2612.579 --> 2617.319
it was a joke you know I don't figure

2615.579 --> 2618.819
that out

2617.319 --> 2620.8
Richard G

2618.819 --> 2623.44
or you're just saying it was a joke to

2620.8 --> 2626.5
diss me just to remind me of yeah of

2623.44 --> 2627.7000000000003
course our wind didn't see that

2626.5 --> 2630.359
because he always takes everything

2627.7 --> 2630.359
literal

2633.819 --> 2637.54
it's all good don't worry about it I'm

2636.04 --> 2640.3
not cranky

2637.54 --> 2644.6
still carrying the summer with me

2640.3 --> 2646.0600000000004
I was here with dirt you mean Darth

2644.6 --> 2649.54
[Music]

2646.06 --> 2651.7
dearth Darth with an a

2649.54 --> 2653.74
but you were there okay okay you were

2651.7 --> 2655.2999999999997
there that's cool there was a lot of

2653.74 --> 2658.0789999999997
people in chat that normally don't hang

2655.3 --> 2658.079
around that's true

2679.6 --> 2682.7799999999997
[Music]

2688.26 --> 2693.88
damn it now I'm hungry maybe I'm gonna

2691.66 --> 2696.48
put that Illuminati castle in the oven

2693.88 --> 2696.48
after all

2699.4 --> 2705.28
or I could wait for an hour and then

2701.56 --> 2707.98
actually just get lunch immediately

2705.28 --> 2710.98
what's the hot topic of the day

2707.98 --> 2710.98
uh

2712.359 --> 2715.0789999999997
where

2715.599 --> 2721.119
I mean in Barataria it's definitely

2718.42 --> 2724.3
Curtis Stone like squirting out like a

2721.119 --> 2727.54
gamma of spaz like really really bad

2724.3 --> 2729.94
like not not seeing something that bad

2727.54 --> 2734.02
since

2729.94 --> 2736.119
well you know since Jim Bob

2734.02 --> 2739.119
that's the topic of the day

2736.119 --> 2739.119
and

2739.48 --> 2745.7400000000002
Europe drank to basically start a

2742.72 --> 2745.74
Communist Revolution

2746.14 --> 2750.2799999999997
I mean it's sort of underway for a while

2748.119 --> 2751.599
but this time they're like going really

2750.28 --> 2754.5400000000004
far with it

2751.599 --> 2757.839
basically saying that governments can

2754.54 --> 2760.9
under guise of emergency just confiscate

2757.839 --> 2764.099
property now like what the [ __ ] man

2760.9 --> 2764.099
that's just

2765.819 --> 2770.2599999999998
that's the beginning of the end I mean

2768.04 --> 2772.3
either we're gonna turn into a communist

2770.26 --> 2774.4
China type of scenario where we're all

2772.3 --> 2776.5
[ __ ] and I will be so demoralized I'm

2774.4 --> 2778.7200000000003
not gonna like even comment on that if

2776.5 --> 2783.06
that's gonna happen anymore

2778.72 --> 2783.06
I will just make my list and then

2783.7 --> 2788.98
sample that I'm not gonna make it much

2786.28 --> 2790.1800000000003
longer and I'll just have to do what I

2788.98 --> 2792.099
can

2790.18 --> 2794.0789999999997
before that ends

2792.099 --> 2795.88
or

2794.079 --> 2799.0600000000004
the Netherlands is truly going to break

2795.88 --> 2801.2200000000003
free snap out of Europe and then it's

2799.06 --> 2804.819
the beginning of the end of Europe

2801.22 --> 2806.9199999999996
because the Netherlands has a key role

2804.819 --> 2809.68
and like they couldn't handle a

2806.92 --> 2811.3
reorganization at this point

2809.68 --> 2814.2999999999997
although there's a good chance that even

2811.3 --> 2817.42
if we broke free that are [ __ ] up

2814.3 --> 2819.04
uh liberal Imperium politicians will

2817.42 --> 2822.16
literally like get out of the country

2819.04 --> 2826.56
and then just take up seat

2822.16 --> 2826.56
with the European government itself

2828.24 --> 2833.22
like even though the Netherlands isn't

2830.619 --> 2833.2200000000003
part of it anymore

2833.619 --> 2838.78
it'd be it will be a while before we can

2836.02 --> 2841.079
get all the freaking tentacles off

2838.78 --> 2841.079
anyway

2841.119 --> 2846.7200000000003
but uh

2843.76 --> 2846.7200000000003
that's happening

2847.3 --> 2850.2000000000003
uh

2852.3 --> 2858.099
[Music]

2855.339 --> 2860.52
Flat Earth debate was not like riveting

2858.099 --> 2860.52
or anything

2861.7 --> 2867.5789999999997
what's kind of funny uh like Nathan

2864.24 --> 2870.4199999999996
we've recycled like a very old show like

2867.579 --> 2870.42
in the hundreds

2870.64 --> 2875.68
like somewhere like 100 something

2872.859 --> 2877.72
episode of The Flat Earth debates from

2875.68 --> 2880.1189999999997
years ago

2877.72 --> 2882.4599999999996
and we basically reviewed that and that

2880.119 --> 2884.7400000000002
was really weird and interesting

2882.46 --> 2887.14
just to see me do what I do but like

2884.74 --> 2888.7
with I'm still using gravity and all

2887.14 --> 2890.6189999999997
that and saying I know this is a

2888.7 --> 2894.339
different gravity

2890.619 --> 2896.1400000000003
it's a directional gravity it's so funny

2894.339 --> 2898.96
to hear myself use that type of

2896.14 --> 2900.94
argumentation and a bit embarrassing was

2898.96 --> 2904.619
unnerving like hearing that with kiwi

2900.94 --> 2904.619
also being them like uh

2906.7 --> 2911.68
what I mean

2908.26 --> 2913.599
my reasoning was good

2911.68 --> 2915.5789999999997
in the actual discussion that was

2913.599 --> 2919.5
happening I was making pointing out

2915.579 --> 2919.5
things that were very valid

2923.44 --> 2929.2200000000003
what are you talking about Supreme

2925.3 --> 2929.2200000000003
knowing that's very unspecific

2929.26 --> 2936.1800000000003
I just had spent like 10 minutes

2931.8 --> 2936.1800000000003
describing a lot of different things

2936.579 --> 2939.94
if you're gonna say it's looking like

2938.2 --> 2942.2799999999997
it's going in that direction what which

2939.94 --> 2944.92
of the directions that I pointed out

2942.28 --> 2948.3
that definitely don't like they can't

2944.92 --> 2948.3
simultaneously exist

2955.839 --> 2960.359
the end of European Union absolutely it

2958.119 --> 2960.359
will

2961.599 --> 2966.94
it's like we're arguably like the

2964.72 --> 2969.16
organizers of it I mean yes supposedly

2966.94 --> 2971.68
the parliament is indulgium but I mean

2969.16 --> 2973.7999999999997
Belgium isn't barely a country at this

2971.68 --> 2973.7999999999997
point

2975.22 --> 2979.48
and even if there was no such thing as

2977.859 --> 2981.22
the European Union I would have still

2979.48 --> 2984.94
said that because

2981.22 --> 2987.2799999999997
there Belgium and I'm Dutch

2984.94 --> 2989.92
and we culturally have to remind them

2987.28 --> 2992.1400000000003
that they're kind of pathetic

2989.92 --> 2994.48
even though like the people there are

2992.14 --> 2996.7599999999998
very likable a lot of them

2994.48 --> 2999.46
I still have to point it out like yeah

2996.76 --> 3004.099
but you are Belgium though you are kind

2999.46 --> 3004.099
of pathetic and [ __ ] compared to us

3004.5 --> 3010.92
right and you can't exactly say like oh

3007.44 --> 3013.98
but you got all liberal and like let all

3010.92 --> 3017.2200000000003
the LGBT [ __ ] and yeah well look at you

3013.98 --> 3020.4
bro you did that too

3017.22 --> 3022.9199999999996
so you can't hold that over us

3020.4 --> 3026.2200000000003
we're just like yeah we corrupted just

3022.92 --> 3029.1800000000003
like you but we're still better than you

3026.22 --> 3029.18
just for the record

3031.74 --> 3036.5989999999997
it's a cultural thing I have to do that

3033.839 --> 3039.2999999999997
yeah nobody even appreciates that

3036.599 --> 3042.079
anymore 40 years ago they would have had

3039.3 --> 3042.079
a blast with that

3043.5 --> 3048.319
uh 30 years ago too

3052.8 --> 3059.099
trying to get used by debunking Oakley

3056.339 --> 3061.5589999999997
no I have not seen that

3059.099 --> 3063.48
that sounds really lame that sounds like

3061.559 --> 3065.88
Sean Hawkin

3063.48 --> 3068.96
John Hawkin does that sort of thing

3065.88 --> 3068.96
was it as lame

3071.88 --> 3075.44
okay being debunked

3075.78 --> 3078.8390000000004
yeah

3076.92 --> 3080.46
snow point

3078.839 --> 3081.9
he's not always right about everything

3080.46 --> 3084.359
but

3081.9 --> 3085.8
the point is is that even if he made a

3084.359 --> 3088.02
mistake

3085.8 --> 3089.7000000000003
or if he had another view he'll just say

3088.02 --> 3093.119
oh yeah yeah that turned out to be wrong

3089.7 --> 3095.839
and it's like yeah so now I've moved on

3093.119 --> 3095.839
how about you

3095.88 --> 3099.559
is totally pointless

3105.96 --> 3112.16
it's almost as pointless as trying to

3108.059 --> 3112.1600000000003
debunk my theories my ideas

3112.619 --> 3116.94
although I I think it's kind of funny

3114.72 --> 3119.5789999999997
I'd love to see somebody like seriously

3116.94 --> 3122.88
go after like oh man today I gotta talk

3119.579 --> 3126.0
about r with this Arwen dude

3122.88 --> 3128.339
he thinks that we're living in some kind

3126.0 --> 3132.54
of Pac-Man game

3128.339 --> 3136.52
this is all loopier I'd love to see that

3132.54 --> 3136.52
I'd love to see like a dedicated

3137.94 --> 3142.02
well I guess it would be troll rant in

3140.579 --> 3144.96
that case

3142.02 --> 3146.94
or like an actual like oh no no we

3144.96 --> 3148.2
definitely can prove that it's not

3146.94 --> 3150.54
looping

3148.2 --> 3153.7799999999997
even though it's flat I mean if you're a

3150.54 --> 3157.619
baller don't don't even try that that's

3153.78 --> 3159.7200000000003
just gonna be embarrassing and funny

3157.619 --> 3161.6400000000003
you know what do try that if you're a

3159.72 --> 3163.6189999999997
baller definitely try to do that that

3161.64 --> 3166.5589999999997
would be hilarious but I'm not gonna

3163.619 --> 3168.6600000000003
like really take it very serious

3166.559 --> 3172.44
but if you're a flat earther and you

3168.66 --> 3176.2799999999997
really think that moopy loopy loop is so

3172.44 --> 3178.079
stupid I'd love you to review my ideas

3176.28 --> 3182.099
about it

3178.079 --> 3184.619
and point out exactly technically based

3182.099 --> 3185.94
on measurements why it's wrong that

3184.619 --> 3188.46
would be fantastic

3185.94 --> 3190.619
I'll probably hear something about plain

3188.46 --> 3192.78
roots

3190.619 --> 3194.7000000000003
when that when that's attempted because

3192.78 --> 3196.559
that are the one of the things that I'm

3194.7 --> 3199.68
like basically like it's a sort of a

3196.559 --> 3202.3190000000004
dead end like I I don't know there are

3199.68 --> 3205.46
suggestions about the plain roots

3202.319 --> 3205.46
that it's a circle

3205.559 --> 3210.38
like oh they're going in a straight line

3207.72 --> 3210.3799999999997
over the disc

3210.54 --> 3213.079
Maybe

3214.68 --> 3219.18
so yeah that is basically where you

3217.319 --> 3220.2599999999998
could argue against the looping model

3219.18 --> 3223.22
but

3220.26 --> 3223.2200000000003
on the other hand

3224.46 --> 3231.119
are you absolutely sure they're not just

3227.16 --> 3234.7799999999997
trying to keep following coastlines

3231.119 --> 3237.599
because yeah risk of flying over direct

3234.78 --> 3241.2000000000003
Open Sea May Simply Be

3237.599 --> 3243.42
higher than they want and hey who says

3241.2 --> 3247.3799999999997
that fuel costs are enormous anymore

3243.42 --> 3249.599
right I thought that we figured out that

3247.38 --> 3253.46
they actually use like weird vacuum

3249.599 --> 3253.46
engines that use very little fuel

3254.22 --> 3258.72
so they're certainly not going to be

3255.96 --> 3261.5
desperate to save costs

3258.72 --> 3261.5
with that

3262.26 --> 3266.6600000000003
they're already saving it and keeping it

3264.359 --> 3266.66
a secret

3268.319 --> 3273.0589999999997
so yeah

3270.96 --> 3275.64
that's one argument you can bring forth

3273.059 --> 3277.92
other than that like

3275.64 --> 3280.3799999999997
I'd like to see this proof that the

3277.92 --> 3281.7000000000003
equator is a circle like a euclidean

3280.38 --> 3283.619
circle

3281.7 --> 3286.3799999999997
like show the Cartesian map and then

3283.619 --> 3288.7200000000003
show how the exact equator position as

3286.38 --> 3292.8
established is exactly

3288.72 --> 3296.2799999999997
in like a Cartesian Square

3292.8 --> 3297.9
on a circle that if you just take the

3296.28 --> 3299.88
line from all the points that were

3297.9 --> 3301.98
officially equator and they just form

3299.88 --> 3303.839
this circle

3301.98 --> 3305.819
but it has to be an actual Cartesian

3303.839 --> 3308.42
grid not just a map projection that's

3305.819 --> 3308.42
pointless

3308.76 --> 3311.8390000000004
I'd love to see it

3313.319 --> 3319.14
anyway so yeah if anybody ever wants to

3316.02 --> 3321.24
like go after me

3319.14 --> 3324.02
and you're not Sean Hawkins because

3321.24 --> 3324.02
that's just lame

3324.18 --> 3328.9199999999996
like I'm not gonna like if it's just a

3326.28 --> 3331.2000000000003
bunch of retards that's not interesting

3328.92 --> 3335.66
I want some serious

3331.2 --> 3335.66
inquiry I want some serious criticism

3336.48 --> 3341.22
you know the looping is just so

3339.359 --> 3344.22
ridiculous

3341.22 --> 3347.2999999999997
that maybe space is looping

3344.22 --> 3349.859
within like a spatial confine

3347.3 --> 3351.96
pre-designed by God

3349.859 --> 3353.88
and I mean a lot of you people out there

3351.96 --> 3356.099
already say like oh well we're already a

3353.88 --> 3358.559
simulation that's secondary

3356.099 --> 3361.619
like oh also we are a simulation are we

3358.559 --> 3363.96
so what the [ __ ] is then the problem in

3361.619 --> 3366.42
having a loop

3363.96 --> 3367.859
you know the Matrix was a simulation

3366.42 --> 3369.78
right

3367.859 --> 3371.819
they had Loop

3369.78 --> 3374.3
so why the hell would it even be a

3371.819 --> 3374.3
problem then

3378.26 --> 3382.28
right anyway I'm rambling

3385.01 --> 3391.6800000000003
[Music]

3387.96 --> 3395.2200000000003
what's my point on satellites

3391.68 --> 3397.3799999999997
what the hell what do you mean

3395.22 --> 3399.9199999999996
talk to you what is my point on

3397.38 --> 3399.92
satellites

3404.579 --> 3411.0
do I have any point on satellites other

3407.579 --> 3412.559
than they are kind of like a fictional

3411.0 --> 3415.619
construct

3412.559 --> 3418.98
made by a science fiction writer

3415.619 --> 3421.7400000000002
in the early 20th century

3418.98 --> 3425.099
and that things don't fall in circles

3421.74 --> 3427.7
unless they're like physically connected

3425.099 --> 3427.7000000000003
right

3437.4 --> 3442.38
right a satellite I mean

3440.22 --> 3444.66
it's not gonna the thing about a

3442.38 --> 3445.92
satellite according to alicentrism is

3444.66 --> 3447.66
that's basically a thing that's

3445.92 --> 3450.599
free-floating

3447.66 --> 3453.48
but then falling

3450.599 --> 3454.8590000000004
through slight gravity of Earth over all

3453.48 --> 3457.5
that distance

3454.859 --> 3460.38
and then it can utilize that full by

3457.5 --> 3461.94
basically moving horizontally relation

3460.38 --> 3465.1800000000003
to the object

3461.94 --> 3467.059
going with the Curve

3465.18 --> 3470.46
and then

3467.059 --> 3471.96
preventing from falling actually falling

3470.46 --> 3476.46
down so like

3471.96 --> 3479.579
the centripetal motion like negates the

3476.46 --> 3483.44
Center of ball Earth

3479.579 --> 3486.3
drop that's the idea of like an orbit

3483.44 --> 3487.5
what set lights are supposedly doing but

3486.3 --> 3489.6600000000003
I mean

3487.5 --> 3491.76
it's complete science fiction of course

3489.66 --> 3495.5
you can never actually physically

3491.76 --> 3495.5
demonstrate anything like that

3495.66 --> 3500.0989999999997
can do however is

3497.94 --> 3502.7400000000002
take a satellite

3500.099 --> 3505.319
suspended by a big helium balloon and

3502.74 --> 3508.6189999999997
then send it up on Antarctica

3505.319 --> 3510.7799999999997
and then you have set light coverage for

3508.619 --> 3513.059
months or years

3510.78 --> 3516.26
from that satellite

3513.059 --> 3516.26
wherever it's gonna hang

3523.079 --> 3527.7200000000003
is that what you were asking for Dr

3525.059 --> 3527.7200000000003
utker

3538.74 --> 3546.74
yep largest buyer of helium is

3542.7 --> 3546.74
is NASA indeed

3546.9 --> 3552.48
or to be more precise

3550.2 --> 3555.0
You could argue that the largest buyers

3552.48 --> 3557.76
of helium are

3555.0 --> 3560.119
the people that give you satellite

3557.76 --> 3560.119
connection

3566.339 --> 3570.839
right when some Telecom company sends up

3569.339 --> 3574.7
a satellite

3570.839 --> 3574.7
where do they get the helium from

3575.22 --> 3579.54
balloons at the worthy of mint yeah

3577.799 --> 3581.94
unless they are high up enough and

3579.54 --> 3583.44
they're outside of their regular layer

3581.94 --> 3586.2000000000003
down here

3583.44 --> 3588.48
that is being subjected because of the

3586.2 --> 3590.8799999999997
sun's interactions and all that

3588.48 --> 3592.7400000000002
by constant wind because really high up

3590.88 --> 3596.6400000000003
there

3592.74 --> 3599.22
there are some wind streams

3596.64 --> 3601.74
there are also some really stale places

3599.22 --> 3604.14
like they got it mapped out how the

3601.74 --> 3607.0789999999997
winds move up there

3604.14 --> 3609.92
and they can just place these balloons

3607.079 --> 3612.299
sent them either on a

3609.92 --> 3614.16
geostationary trajectory where they

3612.299 --> 3617.339
basically just hang still forever

3614.16 --> 3621.42
because there's never any wind there

3617.339 --> 3624.0
or they send him on a orbital trajectory

3621.42 --> 3625.7400000000002
where they go hiking on the standard big

3624.0 --> 3627.48
Windstream that'll literally go around

3625.74 --> 3629.4599999999996
the entire place

3627.48 --> 3631.5
that's what they do with it right that's

3629.46 --> 3633.18
the difference between geostationary

3631.5 --> 3635.94
orbits

3633.18 --> 3639.0
and just

3635.94 --> 3640.799
regular orbits of supposed satellites

3639.0 --> 3642.24
it's where they put it in the wind do

3640.799 --> 3644.22
they put the set balloon in the

3642.24 --> 3646.2599999999998
Windstream or they put it in a still

3644.22 --> 3649.22
space up there

3646.26 --> 3649.2200000000003
that's the difference

3650.819 --> 3655.2599999999998
right and that's just the balloons the

3654.0 --> 3658.02
SAT balloons

3655.26 --> 3661.1400000000003
that's the the old way they did it now

3658.02 --> 3665.0
you have like starlink stuff which isn't

3661.14 --> 3665.0
satellites it's just freaking drones

3665.88 --> 3670.079
so they can keep them stationary and

3668.16 --> 3672.24
then just make a move on they don't they

3670.079 --> 3675.92
don't use the wind streams for those

3672.24 --> 3675.9199999999996
things they don't even go up that high

3676.559 --> 3680.94
or maybe sometimes they do maybe

3678.599 --> 3684.319
sometimes they can go closer

3680.94 --> 3684.319
but they are different

3686.04 --> 3691.5
drones or like Zeppelin type drug I

3689.64 --> 3693.74
don't know exactly what starlink really

3691.5 --> 3693.74
is

3699.16 --> 3704.46
[Music]

3701.28 --> 3706.94
it's it most certainly has like drone

3704.46 --> 3706.94
technology

3707.64 --> 3711.48
that's what it looks like the the

3709.44 --> 3713.7000000000003
maneuvering controls supposedly

3711.48 --> 3716.78
allegedly

3713.7 --> 3716.7799999999997
but I mean yeah

3716.88 --> 3722.819
your neighbor has satellite cables

3720.78 --> 3724.94
yeah hello Darth by the way good to see

3722.819 --> 3724.94
you

3730.559 --> 3735.1800000000003
yeah it was good to have you here

3733.02 --> 3737.52
I'd love to get you back on again

3735.18 --> 3741.0
whenever you're ready by the way

3737.52 --> 3743.46
but I mean our show was pretty good

3741.0 --> 3747.859
it had a lot of hits it's one of my more

3743.46 --> 3747.859
viewed videos from the last week

3750.48 --> 3754.799
I'll have to get you back for a second

3752.22 --> 3757.0989999999997
go maybe I won't be as flustered during

3754.799 --> 3757.099
it

3761.579 --> 3766.38
it was also very hot here and maybe next

3764.64 --> 3768.359
time you can get on it it isn't super

3766.38 --> 3770.76
hot that would be great oh by the way

3768.359 --> 3773.24
clouds seemed to have participated here

3770.76 --> 3773.2400000000002
huh

3773.76 --> 3777.98
look at that

3775.02 --> 3777.98
that's kind of nice

3780.0 --> 3786.24
so there's some sun coming out again

3783.78 --> 3788.7000000000003
some blue sky

3786.24 --> 3790.319
don't see trails

3788.7 --> 3793.4399999999996
then again they don't really leave

3790.319 --> 3797.66
trails when it's this clouded

3793.44 --> 3797.66
it all gets washed away that way

3800.52 --> 3807.0
plants are doing just fine too

3802.799 --> 3809.96
mint is still just go in and go with it

3807.0 --> 3809.96
it's incredible

3813.0 --> 3817.28
I'll show you I'll show you up close for

3815.04 --> 3817.2799999999997
a bit

3818.76 --> 3822.3590000000004
okay I can turn the heater off now

3820.68 --> 3824.72
because it's getting a lot warmer with

3822.359 --> 3824.72
that sun

3824.88 --> 3829.04
the window was kind of fresh earlier

3843.98 --> 3850.14
look at this thing

3846.78 --> 3852.0
look at these shoots here

3850.14 --> 3855.3799999999997
just

3852.0 --> 3855.38
going nuts

3857.359 --> 3862.38
all these sides of its armpits in there

3861.059 --> 3863.88
it's like

3862.38 --> 3866.46
it's like mini

3863.88 --> 3869.54
shoots within shoots within shoots it

3866.46 --> 3869.54
just never stops

3878.04 --> 3882.98
it's also funny that like the leaves are

3880.2 --> 3882.98
getting rougher

3883.799 --> 3887.339
they looked a little smoother at the

3886.26 --> 3890.94
start

3887.339 --> 3893.88
they look much rougher now

3890.94 --> 3896.339
anyway yeah loving it I haven't really

3893.88 --> 3898.7400000000002
used it yet

3896.339 --> 3900.9
I'm just marveled by how hard it's

3898.74 --> 3903.66
growing that I'm just like I don't want

3900.9 --> 3906.5
to cut anything I just want to see how

3903.66 --> 3906.5
hard it grows

3915.44 --> 3918.5
thank you

3919.75 --> 3922.949
[Music]

3929.599 --> 3935.28
cartoonish facial expressions yeah cool

3932.819 --> 3937.079
Darth yeah no I'd love to have you on

3935.28 --> 3939.0
and and we have to figure it out with

3937.079 --> 3941.52
the camera

3939.0 --> 3943.68
oh by the way yeah we did figure it out

3941.52 --> 3946.14
with the camera didn't we I just

3943.68 --> 3949.319
separated it like I didn't have my

3946.14 --> 3950.7599999999998
camera on on Skype but you could put it

3949.319 --> 3953.52
on and then I

3950.76 --> 3956.8190000000004
literally like cut it and just put it

3953.52 --> 3959.04
right next to him right my camera in

3956.819 --> 3962.7799999999997
yeah it did work great

3959.04 --> 3962.7799999999997
is that the mint plant yes

3963.66 --> 3967.74
yes love fruit

3965.76 --> 3970.8590000000004
like that thing is like tripled in

3967.74 --> 3973.3599999999997
biomass since I bought that at minimum

3970.859 --> 3975.9
maybe quadruple

3973.36 --> 3978.6800000000003
[Music]

3975.9 --> 3982.5
okay

3978.68 --> 3985.0789999999997
but yeah it's a spearmint plan

3982.5 --> 3988.099
I thought I'd buy one

3985.079 --> 3991.98
since it's yeah it's practically a weed

3988.099 --> 3994.6800000000003
and see I drink minty so I thought like

3991.98 --> 3995.7
well minty is not exactly cheap when you

3994.68 --> 3997.68
buy that

3995.7 --> 4000.0389999999998
so maybe I can like have some of it

3997.68 --> 4000.0389999999998
myself

4001.039 --> 4007.2990000000004
I have two gallon jars of mint

4004.52 --> 4007.299
Jesus

4012.619 --> 4015.52
wow

4018.859 --> 4023.7799999999997
that's really cool speaking star water

4020.839 --> 4026.2599999999998
I'm kind of jealous two gallon jars

4023.78 --> 4026.26
Jesus

4027.44 --> 4032.38
you got like entire fields of that stuff

4029.9 --> 4032.38
out there

4041.559 --> 4046.1800000000003
Swiss recall I meant hmm

4051.42 --> 4059.079
[Music]

4054.619 --> 4059.079
too much for answers wow very cool

4074.06 --> 4077.27
[Music]

4079.539 --> 4084.5200000000004
DirecTV internet

4081.92 --> 4084.52
what

4089.96 --> 4092.559
foreign

4110.42 --> 4114.319
satellite internet

4112.339 --> 4116.719
oh isn't that just wireless internet

4114.319 --> 4118.9400000000005
that's just Towers I mean we have

4116.719 --> 4121.339
wireless internet here too

4118.94 --> 4123.678999999999
I can have wireless internet if I want

4121.339 --> 4125.7789999999995
it literally through the modem most

4123.679 --> 4127.64
people use wireless internet through

4125.779 --> 4129.5
their own modems

4127.64 --> 4133.2390000000005
it's Wi-Fi

4129.5 --> 4139.0
which is the same type of stuff as

4133.239 --> 4139.0
s5g effectively has a limited range

4144.56 --> 4148.719
because you lived in a rural area right

4148.88 --> 4154.9400000000005
but I mean a lot of the wireless

4151.359 --> 4158.92
external things are just Towers they're

4154.94 --> 4158.919999999999
just Towers they have a reach

4159.38 --> 4165.4400000000005
it's like all this internet stuff

4162.92 --> 4168.319
can all be done with Towers except with

4165.44 --> 4171.639999999999
5G because it has a very short range

4168.319 --> 4171.64
so it doesn't work like that

4173.12 --> 4179.14
so it was balloons or hidden Tower yeah

4175.279 --> 4179.14
very likely or a drone

4185.299 --> 4191.42
they could just like send up a drone

4187.16 --> 4194.78
like they have two they just send one up

4191.42 --> 4196.64
then it runs out of fuel or electricity

4194.78 --> 4198.44
and then they send the other one up and

4196.64 --> 4199.9400000000005
then they let the first one down they

4198.44 --> 4202.219
refueled it

4199.94 --> 4204.389999999999
and they keep doing that that that can

4202.219 --> 4206.84
be a way to do it too

4204.39 --> 4208.58
[Music]

4206.84 --> 4210.9800000000005
right

4208.58 --> 4213.5
because when you send up a balloon well

4210.98 --> 4215.678999999999
it's up there it's not gonna go down for

4213.5 --> 4215.679
a while

4219.04 --> 4223.5199999999995
well with a drone you can literally send

4221.659 --> 4226.28
it up and then like oh we have to

4223.52 --> 4229.42
repurpose it quickly get it down and now

4226.28 --> 4229.42
we're gonna send it over there

4230.54 --> 4235.42
and that just sounds more like what

4232.64 --> 4235.42
starlink is

4241.46 --> 4243.76
foreign

4252.4 --> 4257.379999999999
still extremely expensive to use yeah

4266.3 --> 4269.56
yeah they are

4277.54 --> 4282.92
moment of silence for the Forgotten deep

4280.159 --> 4284.48
sea kills that power communities no I'm

4282.92 --> 4287.4800000000005
not forgetting about those at all those

4284.48 --> 4290.659
are definitely the satellite that's like

4287.48 --> 4294.4
the Internet it's all cables

4290.659 --> 4294.4
but I mean there are like

4294.98 --> 4299.54
distances between it and here and there

4297.26 --> 4302.9800000000005
but those distances are mostly like

4299.54 --> 4302.98
where we're at

4303.32 --> 4311.42
there's no Wireless super cable you see

4308.36 --> 4316.219
where the most data traffic that's all

4311.42 --> 4319.219
solid cables on Earth and in the ocean

4316.219 --> 4320.9
but to eventually like connect up to

4319.219 --> 4323.719
individuals that's where they use

4320.9 --> 4325.599999999999
wireless sometimes

4323.719 --> 4329.44
because then you don't have to build

4325.6 --> 4329.4400000000005
infrastructure in the wilderness

4353.3 --> 4357.1
what are you talking about

4370.34 --> 4375.38
Sterling is an electromagnetic

4372.56 --> 4376.9400000000005
phenomenon not a string of what what do

4375.38 --> 4378.86
you mean

4376.94 --> 4381.5
what are you talking about seeking star

4378.86 --> 4385.839999999999
water what does that mean

4381.5 --> 4385.84
what the electromagnetic phenomenon

4391.4 --> 4397.599999999999
are you saying it's just a thing that

4393.86 --> 4397.599999999999
allows you to bounce signals off

4398.36 --> 4401.719
is that it

4399.8 --> 4404.84
is that starlink it's just like oh

4401.719 --> 4407.3
starlink is that you can bounce signals

4404.84 --> 4410.9800000000005
of whatever there whatever is up there

4407.3 --> 4410.9800000000005
is that what it is according to you

4436.04 --> 4440.54
what

4437.26 --> 4442.6990000000005
cyclical Celestial for now what are you

4440.54 --> 4444.26
talking about you mean the supposed

4442.699 --> 4446.719
lights

4444.26 --> 4450.02
that moved in a line

4446.719 --> 4453.219
that's not a natural phenomenon that's

4450.02 --> 4453.219
definitely man-made

4454.06 --> 4458.620000000001
that's drones with lights

4459.199 --> 4464.719
like that absolutely is drones with

4462.26 --> 4468.820000000001
lights not a natural Celestial

4464.719 --> 4468.82
phenomenon absolutely not

4479.719 --> 4483.52
unless you're not talking about that

4484.58 --> 4487.48
it's a bit fake

4489.679 --> 4494.8
we disagree yeah while you're being very

4491.96 --> 4494.8
vague about it

4520.219 --> 4522.28
oh

4532.159 --> 4537.5199999999995
we think he means seeking star Waters as

4534.8 --> 4537.52
she Darth

4538.46 --> 4543.56
but uh

4540.8 --> 4546.1
yeah it's just fake and like what are

4543.56 --> 4546.1
you talking about

4547.82 --> 4552.88
starlink's not a Celestial phenomenon it

4550.58 --> 4552.88
isn't

4555.44 --> 4558.82
it's not non-local

4560.6 --> 4566.42
The Institute yeah well no

4564.26 --> 4568.9400000000005
I can read your tarot book and it's not

4566.42 --> 4570.7390000000005
gonna make it make sense so you can

4568.94 --> 4572.719
start water

4570.739 --> 4575.739
yeah it's reading your tarot book

4572.719 --> 4575.7390000000005
doesn't solve everything

4576.14 --> 4581.860000000001
you put a couple of interesting leads in

4578.42 --> 4581.86
there it doesn't make them true

4588.98 --> 4594.94
that leads to Ether in there too that

4591.56 --> 4594.9400000000005
doesn't make ether true either

4599.659 --> 4605.86
all right Darth yeah see you later

4603.02 --> 4607.040000000001
thanks for popping by

4605.86 --> 4609.04
[Music]

4607.04 --> 4609.04
e

4628.6 --> 4633.620000000001
reports from history about strange

4631.76 --> 4635.719
lights from the internet

4633.62 --> 4637.82
um sure but there are many strange

4635.719 --> 4641.32
lights

4637.82 --> 4641.32
starlink is not one of them

4657.8 --> 4664.0
but I mean yeah the celestials are

4659.9 --> 4664.0
strange they are definitely strange

4672.76 --> 4677.360000000001
uh okay well that's not the same ether

4676.46 --> 4679.82
that

4677.36 --> 4683.199
that I know seeking steroid I have no

4679.82 --> 4683.199
idea what you're talking about now

4683.84 --> 4689.14
yeah either there is no ether if there's

4686.6 --> 4689.14
a concept

4694.219 --> 4699.38
there's nothing in the world that

4696.62 --> 4702.5
requires ether to exist in order to

4699.38 --> 4704.900000000001
explain what happens nothing nothing in

4702.5 --> 4707.54
this world requires ether in order to

4704.9 --> 4710.239
explain what is happening nothing

4707.54 --> 4711.92
not a single natural or man-made

4710.239 --> 4714.0199999999995
phenomenon

4711.92 --> 4717.1
yeah

4714.02 --> 4720.92
that has ever been observed

4717.1 --> 4723.08
requires ether to exist to explain the

4720.92 --> 4725.7390000000005
phenomenon okay

4723.08 --> 4725.739
none

4725.86 --> 4731.0599999999995
it's all conjured

4728.659 --> 4734.54
it's an aberration it's just like

4731.06 --> 4737.42
gravity except it's an older gravity

4734.54 --> 4739.28
I think that gravity is more recent Than

4737.42 --> 4741.26
The Ether aberration I think ether

4739.28 --> 4743.96
aberration was first I think that even

4741.26 --> 4746.38
the old Alchemists were dealing with

4743.96 --> 4746.38
that [ __ ]

4748.219 --> 4753.199
because when you do research you're

4751.28 --> 4755.0599999999995
always going to bump into the

4753.199 --> 4757.099999999999
aberrations and the aberrations are

4755.06 --> 4760.6990000000005
always going to Fascinate You

4757.1 --> 4762.620000000001
and not let you go why because you can

4760.699 --> 4764.36
never resolve them you can never move

4762.62 --> 4765.199
Beyond them because you can never prove

4764.36 --> 4767.48
them

4765.199 --> 4769.759999999999
and that's why it's an aberration it'll

4767.48 --> 4773.178999999999
just keep drawing your attention taking

4769.76 --> 4775.76
up your inner World until you end up

4773.179 --> 4778.6990000000005
defending that which you literally don't

4775.76 --> 4781.76
even know what it is

4778.699 --> 4785.678999999999
and losing track of everything else

4781.76 --> 4785.679
that's what aberrations do to people

4789.08 --> 4791.62
thank you

4793.64 --> 4798.400000000001
it's okay in the Supreme now I'm sure

4795.8 --> 4798.400000000001
see you later

4798.98 --> 4802.959999999999
still got 25 minutes to go here

4815.75 --> 4818.859
[Music]

4824.179 --> 4829.219
what photos

4827.0 --> 4831.8
a balloon behind him what are you

4829.219 --> 4834.46
talking about us

4831.8 --> 4834.46
what

4834.5 --> 4837.88
where are you getting that from

4859.64 --> 4866.860000000001
hello SCV Channel me too what I don't

4863.96 --> 4866.86
know what you're talking about

4867.8 --> 4872.179
you're only asking about satellite yeah

4869.9 --> 4874.42
and let's see what happens see what

4872.179 --> 4874.42
happens

4876.26 --> 4881.0
what you think you can just only ask

4878.719 --> 4882.56
about satellites and not have a gigantic

4881.0 --> 4884.54
bigger Fest

4882.56 --> 4887.9800000000005
start to come into being out of nowhere

4884.54 --> 4890.84
not associated it doesn't work that way

4887.98 --> 4894.44
no I don't know

4890.84 --> 4896.62
why it's just that yeah satellites I

4894.44 --> 4896.62
mean

4896.659 --> 4903.8099999999995
definitely know what they're not

4898.62 --> 4903.8099999999995
[Music]

4916.52 --> 4919.52
foreign

4942.219 --> 4946.76
let's account no longer than two weeks

4945.02 --> 4949.580000000001
old

4946.76 --> 4950.96
how's it hanging just as it does every

4949.58 --> 4953.86
day

4950.96 --> 4953.86
show every day

4957.3 --> 4960.39
[Music]

4960.44 --> 4965.36
and thanks to the continuation of the

4962.78 --> 4966.5
support I actually keep doing show every

4965.36 --> 4968.659
day

4966.5 --> 4971.12
because if I didn't then I wouldn't be

4968.659 --> 4974.179
doing a show every day

4971.12 --> 4976.64
so yeah please support me and then I can

4974.179 --> 4979.219
keep going every day

4976.64 --> 4980.719
because I'd love to continue that

4979.219 --> 4983.54
but not

4980.719 --> 4985.88
if I'm hungry and cranky because I got

4983.54 --> 4988.58
nothing to smoke

4985.88 --> 4991.88
so yeah please support your local Arwin

4988.58 --> 4993.679
if you like this show in this unique

4991.88 --> 4995.900000000001
time slot that nobody else in the world

4993.679 --> 4998.06
seems to ever want to do a show at at

4995.9 --> 5001.179
this time slot which is perfect

4998.06 --> 5003.88
I'm like good it's mine

5001.179 --> 5006.34
it's my time slot nobody else in the

5003.88 --> 5007.3
freaking world does a show on my time

5006.34 --> 5009.96
slot

5007.3 --> 5009.96
nobody

5010.78 --> 5013.86
I don't know any

5014.14 --> 5019.96
I'm probably some out there but like

5017.1 --> 5021.52
publicly I don't know anybody that has a

5019.96 --> 5024.1
show during this time slot so if you

5021.52 --> 5025.360000000001
wanted to keep being filled

5024.1 --> 5027.9400000000005
with

5025.36 --> 5029.32
just interesting conversation and just

5027.94 --> 5032.98
like

5029.32 --> 5032.98
free culture

5034.239 --> 5039.58
where like I am free I am going to say

5037.54 --> 5041.62
whatever I think even if I think that it

5039.58 --> 5043.78
will offend some people and sometimes I

5041.62 --> 5046.3
will say it especially because I think

5043.78 --> 5047.86
it will offend people I will do it on

5046.3 --> 5050.320000000001
purpose

5047.86 --> 5052.679
because nothing's stopping me not even

5050.32 --> 5052.679
me

5056.8 --> 5061.12
but yeah if you'd like that type of show

5059.32 --> 5062.92
if you like these discussions if you

5061.12 --> 5065.199
like to ask questions and then have

5062.92 --> 5066.6990000000005
people bicker about other subjects

5065.199 --> 5069.0599999999995
because of that for like 10 minutes

5066.699 --> 5069.0599999999995
straight

5069.82 --> 5075.159
then please support my show through

5072.46 --> 5076.4800000000005
PayPal in the description box I need

5075.159 --> 5079.239
support

5076.48 --> 5081.699
I got a bit so I'm doing a show tomorrow

5079.239 --> 5083.379999999999
but unless I get more and then I'm not

5081.699 --> 5086.339999999999
gonna do a show after that if I don't

5083.38 --> 5086.34
get more support tomorrow

5086.62 --> 5090.239
so please support me

5090.58 --> 5096.78
yeah I'm not part of the Brotherhood of

5092.98 --> 5096.78
grifters or the liberal Imperium

5097.0 --> 5101.679
because my priority is not to suck you

5099.64 --> 5103.54
all drive for money

5101.679 --> 5105.219
if if that would have been my target

5103.54 --> 5108.34
audience I would have had another target

5105.219 --> 5110.62
audience that would be much more

5108.34 --> 5113.1990000000005
easy going

5110.62 --> 5115.599999999999
and less interactable

5113.199 --> 5117.28
right people that you can leech on are

5115.6 --> 5121.0
people that

5117.28 --> 5123.159
don't like to be spotlighted so much I

5121.0 --> 5124.36
just like to have something to feel good

5123.159 --> 5126.4
about

5124.36 --> 5128.62
those people are the people that the

5126.4 --> 5130.0599999999995
Brotherhood of grifters is very easy to

5128.62 --> 5132.699
to leech off

5130.06 --> 5135.34
because they just provide them hope and

5132.699 --> 5137.799999999999
never actually give any any change

5135.34 --> 5139.96
right all hope no change that's the

5137.8 --> 5142.6
Brotherhood of grifters

5139.96 --> 5147.219
right liberal Imperium is not

5142.6 --> 5149.08
doing super great but they're not yeah

5147.219 --> 5151.5
they're not really going away either

5149.08 --> 5151.5
right

5152.98 --> 5158.08
so if you want something that's in the

5154.96 --> 5161.9800000000005
middle and not involved

5158.08 --> 5163.36
then yeah you have this guy telling you

5161.98 --> 5165.638999999999
overtly

5163.36 --> 5168.94
like I need you to send me money

5165.639 --> 5172.54
unconditionally I am e-bagging so that I

5168.94 --> 5175.419999999999
can have smokes and food

5172.54 --> 5178.179
because I'm on social welfare and I

5175.42 --> 5180.46
don't feel like I can afford having a a

5178.179 --> 5183.9400000000005
job

5180.46 --> 5186.58
to be able to get around and then do

5183.94 --> 5188.138999999999
this what I do right here at the same

5186.58 --> 5191.32
time that's not going to be possible any

5188.139 --> 5195.6990000000005
job that's gonna provide for me enough

5191.32 --> 5198.5199999999995
to to get around is definitely going to

5195.699 --> 5200.98
take up these two hours now isn't it

5198.52 --> 5204.280000000001
definitely going to do that I don't know

5200.98 --> 5206.879999999999
any full-time job in the world

5204.28 --> 5210.04
that doesn't demand your

5206.88 --> 5213.28
1pm 2 p.m hour

5210.04 --> 5215.139
slots there's no job in the world that's

5213.28 --> 5216.699
actually like a full-time job that

5215.139 --> 5218.62
doesn't claim those hours it doesn't

5216.699 --> 5220.9
exist

5218.62 --> 5222.639
so

5220.9 --> 5225.339999999999
that's

5222.639 --> 5227.5
why I'm doing this

5225.34 --> 5229.659000000001
because basically nobody else is crazy

5227.5 --> 5232.3
enough to go at this time slot because

5229.659 --> 5234.099999999999
everybody will always need it if they

5232.3 --> 5235.900000000001
want to be financially self-sufficient

5234.1 --> 5238.179
out there

5235.9 --> 5239.799999999999
so in that sense I'm providing a unique

5238.179 --> 5242.8
service

5239.8 --> 5245.679
but yeah

5242.8 --> 5247.659000000001
welfare especially in this crazy age of

5245.679 --> 5249.4
like government trying to choke

5247.659 --> 5251.0199999999995
everybody out and hiking the prices

5249.4 --> 5252.638999999999
everywhere with everything and

5251.02 --> 5254.4400000000005
increasing taxes and it's just getting

5252.639 --> 5256.02
completely out of control this is going

5254.44 --> 5258.82
to be like a

5256.02 --> 5262.42
1917 situation if this financial

5258.82 --> 5264.34
Crackdown continues even further

5262.42 --> 5266.5
it's going to be like a wheelbarrow of

5264.34 --> 5268.8
cash situation eventually if this gets

5266.5 --> 5268.8
worse

5270.1 --> 5274.96
so yeah

5271.9 --> 5277.599999999999
you can't actually completely get by by

5274.96 --> 5279.28
social welfare even though that's the

5277.6 --> 5281.860000000001
definition

5279.28 --> 5283.659
of like how much it is is like what's

5281.86 --> 5287.139
the minimum amount you need to like

5283.659 --> 5290.739
decently get by to be able to survive

5287.139 --> 5294.04
without luxuries basically

5290.739 --> 5296.98
and yeah guess what it's not enough

5294.04 --> 5299.739
it's not enough for what I do

5296.98 --> 5302.5599999999995
and so I need support

5299.739 --> 5303.699
and a lot of you guys are not super rich

5302.56 --> 5305.8
or anything

5303.699 --> 5307.0
and you're struggling as well in this

5305.8 --> 5309.400000000001
economy

5307.0 --> 5314.76
how things are going out there so I

5309.4 --> 5314.759999999999
definitely try to give you guys tips and

5315.58 --> 5320.639
at the same time I I really like to eat

5323.62 --> 5328.44
so I gotta do it I gotta ask for support

5338.82 --> 5344.86
and I one of the things that I pray for

5342.34 --> 5346.0
is that you all guys all get the best

5344.86 --> 5348.82
jobs

5346.0 --> 5351.46
and that I can

5348.82 --> 5354.099999999999
prevent you from taking terrible jobs

5351.46 --> 5357.34
like I don't want you to panic and to

5354.1 --> 5359.56
risk irrational things just to get jobs

5357.34 --> 5361.659000000001
right because right now for example and

5359.56 --> 5363.159000000001
a little example of this Timmy traveler

5361.659 --> 5365.86
told me

5363.159 --> 5369.5199999999995
There's jobs around that pay really well

5365.86 --> 5372.099999999999
a new one condition you gotta take the

5369.52 --> 5375.580000000001
shot yes it's out there

5372.1 --> 5379.06
all these death their Mouse death traps

5375.58 --> 5381.219
are put being put out there yeah

5379.06 --> 5385.120000000001
economy is probably especially in the

5381.219 --> 5387.82
United States the worst it's ever been

5385.12 --> 5390.04
this is like really bad how things are

5387.82 --> 5392.38
working out there it's getting

5390.04 --> 5396.1
[ __ ] up

5392.38 --> 5400.179
but you can always count on Mega

5396.1 --> 5403.360000000001
billionaire trillionaires to fund

5400.179 --> 5406.719
specific jobs under the condition that

5403.36 --> 5409.12
you kill yourself yeah those jobs are

5406.719 --> 5413.159
definitely out there and I don't want

5409.12 --> 5415.9
you guys in my chat to go for those jobs

5413.159 --> 5418.239
especially not because you just had to

5415.9 --> 5420.5199999999995
support Arwin that's just [ __ ] up I

5418.239 --> 5422.32
don't want any deaths I don't want my

5420.52 --> 5424.96
followers

5422.32 --> 5426.699
to work themselves to death so I can eat

5424.96 --> 5429.58
a little better

5426.699 --> 5434.5599999999995
I want you to find the good jobs and if

5429.58 --> 5434.5599999999995
possible even create jobs

5435.699 --> 5441.28
right if all these [ __ ] corporations

5438.219 --> 5443.92
are all selling out to death

5441.28 --> 5447.699
making everybody do that [ __ ] and we'll

5443.92 --> 5449.62
go bust they will go bust well that

5447.699 --> 5451.48
means there's going to be companies

5449.62 --> 5453.5199999999995
going bust everywhere

5451.48 --> 5455.0199999999995
that should make some room

5453.52 --> 5457.6
so

5455.02 --> 5460.6
wouldn't it be logically

5457.6 --> 5462.76
possible to basically create new

5460.6 --> 5466.6
companies that literally

5462.76 --> 5470.1990000000005
do not abide by any of that crap

5466.6 --> 5473.139
no complicated constructions

5470.199 --> 5475.719
local oriented

5473.139 --> 5477.639
and just like take over the functions

5475.719 --> 5480.96
that these Mega corporations were

5477.639 --> 5480.96
stealing off everybody

5481.179 --> 5484.9
right

5482.5 --> 5487.96
needs to be replaced so how can you

5484.9 --> 5490.299999999999
replace that [ __ ] without becoming it

5487.96 --> 5492.82
and that's the big question true

5490.3 --> 5495.1
self-sufficiency is that you can

5492.82 --> 5497.639
literally do the things that are

5495.1 --> 5497.639
necessary

5498.46 --> 5502.4800000000005
that the things can be produced that are

5501.28 --> 5505.48
necessary

5502.48 --> 5507.759999999999
that that the mega corporations love to

5505.48 --> 5510.4
monopolize on they love you to be

5507.76 --> 5512.4400000000005
completely dependent on just them

5510.4 --> 5515.799999999999
for those complicated things right

5512.44 --> 5519.04
because then they can make you do

5515.8 --> 5522.1
whatever they want and you'll do it to

5519.04 --> 5525.159
get it and we don't want that

5522.1 --> 5527.679
because that's how you lose that's how

5525.159 --> 5529.839999999999
you get that shot eventually

5527.679 --> 5533.4400000000005
that's how you die that's how you are

5529.84 --> 5536.38
exterminated through those systems

5533.44 --> 5540.099999999999
so I mostly want you guys to get safe

5536.38 --> 5543.88
jobs and potentially to maybe even start

5540.1 --> 5546.280000000001
companies to start rivaling

5543.88 --> 5548.92
with these Mega corporations that are

5546.28 --> 5551.98
literally destroying themselves and

5548.92 --> 5554.26
leaving a gap in the market potentially

5551.98 --> 5557.0199999999995
I want you guys to figure out a way to

5554.26 --> 5561.219
ride the Curve

5557.02 --> 5563.139
of that self demolition explosion that

5561.219 --> 5565.42
these Mega corporations are performing

5563.139 --> 5567.9400000000005
on themselves I want you to ride that

5565.42 --> 5571.12
wave I want you to find a way

5567.94 --> 5576.159
to write that wave

5571.12 --> 5578.5599999999995
and take that Gap in the market somehow

5576.159 --> 5582.4
to replace them

5578.56 --> 5585.280000000001
while they blow themselves up

5582.4 --> 5587.5599999999995
through this crazy [ __ ] that they've all

5585.28 --> 5591.34
been grafted into you don't have to

5587.56 --> 5595.139
graft yourself into their [ __ ] yeah you

5591.34 --> 5595.139
don't have to have those connections

5595.3 --> 5600.88
those specific contracts are specific

5597.94 --> 5602.259999999999
deals that they all have they're all

5600.88 --> 5604.3
stuck to it in the American corporate

5602.26 --> 5606.58
you don't have to do that you're a free

5604.3 --> 5609.06
person you don't have to make those

5606.58 --> 5609.0599999999995
deals

5609.1 --> 5612.0
use it

5617.08 --> 5621.82
when three months without work to avoid

5619.0 --> 5622.84
that that's great well done drunken

5621.82 --> 5624.94
bullet

5622.84 --> 5626.02
I'm sorry to hear that almost killed you

5624.94 --> 5628.54
but

5626.02 --> 5631.2390000000005
I mean

5628.54 --> 5634.56
at least you didn't

5631.239 --> 5634.5599999999995
do that you know

5635.219 --> 5643.78
costly killed all mostly all pensioners

5640.179 --> 5646.92
called it well that's this yeah kofit

5643.78 --> 5646.92
doesn't actually kill anything

5648.65 --> 5654.638999999999
[Music]

5652.06 --> 5657.159000000001
like I don't think it even is a thing

5654.639 --> 5658.0
I mean can I see gospel it on that

5657.159 --> 5659.799999999999
please

5658.0 --> 5662.76
you know I don't think it is a thing

5659.8 --> 5662.76
it's just a flu

5663.28 --> 5668.38
it's just a flu

5666.52 --> 5671.4400000000005
it isn't anything it doesn't do anything

5668.38 --> 5673.42
only the weak people die from basic

5671.44 --> 5676.299999999999
diseases that don't normally kill

5673.42 --> 5678.04
anybody so it's not worth considering

5676.3 --> 5680.4400000000005
yeah

5678.04 --> 5684.6
flu can kill

5680.44 --> 5684.599999999999
that's right if you're weak

5689.679 --> 5693.52
Cold's always hard on all the people

5691.3 --> 5695.679
yeah well every form of disease is

5693.52 --> 5698.02
always hard on older people that's just

5695.679 --> 5701.52
how it works

5698.02 --> 5701.52
poison kills yeah that's right

5701.98 --> 5704.699
so

5704.86 --> 5711.639
there is no vaccination against flu like

5708.699 --> 5713.98
oh they say there is but it's not even

5711.639 --> 5716.02
it doesn't apply gas postulate it's just

5713.98 --> 5718.12
[ __ ] around it doesn't work it's

5716.02 --> 5720.820000000001
never been proven to work

5718.12 --> 5724.0
even within their own theorizing on how

5720.82 --> 5725.92
it all works virology it it should it's

5724.0 --> 5729.1
not even supposed to be able to work

5725.92 --> 5731.7390000000005
it's all a [ __ ] scam anyway all of

5729.1 --> 5735.06
that all the flu shots is a [ __ ] scam

5731.739 --> 5735.0599999999995
it always was a scam

5736.719 --> 5740.1
so don't do it

5741.52 --> 5745.84
I'm glad you didn't do it drunken bull I

5743.98 --> 5748.239
really hope you didn't like give in

5745.84 --> 5751.54
anyway because it was so terribly tough

5748.239 --> 5754.5599999999995
on you don't do it they literally just

5751.54 --> 5754.56
make you kill yourself

5762.1 --> 5766.780000000001
it's a mousetrap it's a Eugenics

5764.92 --> 5768.34
mousetrap it's like oh you deprive

5766.78 --> 5770.98
everybody then you set out the mouse

5768.34 --> 5772.719
traps everybody's hungry they're gonna

5770.98 --> 5775.0
go for it

5772.719 --> 5778.6
and that's how you kill a population

5775.0 --> 5782.32
that's exactly how you kill them

5778.6 --> 5784.179
that's called genocide

5782.32 --> 5786.4
yeah

5784.179 --> 5788.8
turn the economy down make it a terrible

5786.4 --> 5791.0199999999995
for everybody and then you give them all

5788.8 --> 5795.1
these opportunities all you have to do

5791.02 --> 5798.52
is kill yourself yeah that's that's

5795.1 --> 5798.52
called genocide

5798.82 --> 5802.0199999999995
it's genocide

5811.92 --> 5817.02
nope wouldn't I do great I'm glad to

5814.6 --> 5817.02
hear that

5817.179 --> 5821.26
yet they keep rolling I don't know yeah

5819.04 --> 5824.0199999999995
because with some peoples they just need

5821.26 --> 5827.679
more of it to actually finally die

5824.02 --> 5830.1990000000005
right some people just it's tougher just

5827.679 --> 5832.54
somehow their physiology like manages

5830.199 --> 5834.759999999999
even with all that [ __ ] happening so

5832.54 --> 5837.42
it's just like oh we need more they're

5834.76 --> 5841.659000000001
not dead yet

5837.42 --> 5844.179
yeah that's that's why that is

5841.659 --> 5847.5599999999995
hey Len Lennox good to see you

5844.179 --> 5847.56
you are late indeed

5867.46 --> 5873.4800000000005
like what are you talking about land

5870.1 --> 5873.4800000000005
Linux no

5877.48 --> 5880.919999999999
hey a Como virus

5891.54 --> 5895.62
oxygen kills what the [ __ ]

5897.96 --> 5903.28
right anyway I hope you guys all enjoyed

5900.639 --> 5904.89
the show I'm gonna be rounding out soon

5903.28 --> 5907.919
it's weird not

5904.89 --> 5907.919000000001
[Music]

5909.76 --> 5916.139
I am very hungry

5912.159 --> 5916.138999999999
definitely gonna go downstairs

5916.179 --> 5919.679
make some baked eggs

5919.719 --> 5925.78
as soon as I round out the show

5923.139 --> 5929.08
oh

5925.78 --> 5933.84
you made it barely see me Traveler

5929.08 --> 5933.84
everybody gets in late like what is this

5936.96 --> 5941.08
don't worry I know it's early for you

5939.4 --> 5942.28
guys

5941.08 --> 5945.12
you're just gonna have to watch

5942.28 --> 5945.12
afterwards

5948.219 --> 5951.219
foreign

5958.679 --> 5963.42
very inefficient way to conduct genocide

5961.3 --> 5967.3
it is if you want to avoid liability

5963.42 --> 5969.4
Aries 106 it's very efficient

5967.3 --> 5971.26
you see if they just like kill them all

5969.4 --> 5972.699
then it would be record like yeah they

5971.26 --> 5976.96
kill them all

5972.699 --> 5979.36
what are you gonna do now it's like uh

5976.96 --> 5982.36
nobody's technically been forced yeah

5979.36 --> 5985.12
they were all starved

5982.36 --> 5987.58
everything is being taken from them but

5985.12 --> 5990.12
nobody actually technically forced them

5987.58 --> 5990.12
to do that

5991.36 --> 5995.98
and that's how they

5994.42 --> 5999.659
do I buy

5995.98 --> 5999.659
coax yet of course I do

6000.06 --> 6005.04
I think I'm nuts

6002.76 --> 6009.62
I don't eat anything that is an organic

6005.04 --> 6009.62
Dr rootker nothing not a thing

6014.28 --> 6018.08
that's why I need to eat less

6018.9 --> 6024.54
that's why I eat

6021.3 --> 6027.719
what to the average person would be like

6024.54 --> 6031.92
half of their amount of food that's what

6027.719 --> 6034.5
I eat and I can because I eat organic

6031.92 --> 6037.88
eating organic is cheaper than eating

6034.5 --> 6037.88
non-organic did you know that

6038.1 --> 6043.320000000001
yeah because you end up eating less you

6040.98 --> 6045.78
need to eat less because there's less

6043.32 --> 6047.699
toxic crap that you constant continually

6045.78 --> 6050.159
have to deal with because that is part

6047.699 --> 6053.719
of what you're eating

6050.159 --> 6053.719
so you end up eating less

6054.84 --> 6057.4400000000005
huh

6065.4 --> 6069.96
sure starts at 4am here yeah man up

6068.159 --> 6071.099999999999
steamy traveler I mean it's just four

6069.96 --> 6073.44
o'clock in the middle of the night

6071.1 --> 6076.58
that's the problem

6073.44 --> 6076.58
I'm just joking

6095.46 --> 6100.1
great well glad to see you all here

6100.56 --> 6104.179
and now the chat's broken

6106.98 --> 6109.759999999999

6110.82 --> 6114.259999999999

incredible

6127.5 --> 6130.88
well glad you're all here

6133.38 --> 6136.86
maybe some people are tuning in because

6135.48 --> 6138.959999999999
they think that the Brotherhood of

6136.86 --> 6141.719
grifters versus liberal Imperium is

6138.96 --> 6144.6
actually about Flat Earth it isn't

6141.719 --> 6147.06
this is not about Flat Earth

6144.6 --> 6149.820000000001
I assure you

6147.06 --> 6153.9800000000005
fed is not the Brotherhood of grifters

6149.82 --> 6153.98

6155.699 --> 6158.178999999999
right
