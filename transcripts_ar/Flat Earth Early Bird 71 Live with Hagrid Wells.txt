31.119 --> 35.28
look a kitty i got a cat

36.399 --> 40.96
it's not my cat oh and now he's seen the

39.6 --> 44.0
birds outside

40.96 --> 44.96
it's a it's a wandering cat a pretty

44.0 --> 48.64
healthy one

44.96 --> 51.76
and he always comes to visit

48.64 --> 51.76
and well

52.8 --> 57.519999999999996
and he's quite an adventure so i just

55.039 --> 59.84
thought okay i'd let engineering

57.52 --> 59.84
see

63.92 --> 68.32000000000001
yeah funny i guess the cat adopted me

67.6 --> 71.6
anyway

68.32 --> 75.27999999999999
uh hagrid wells

71.6 --> 76.08
yeah good day i'm i'm doing actually

75.28 --> 79.68
fine

76.08 --> 80.32
just got off work so i uh i thought i'd

79.68 --> 84.4
picked a

80.32 --> 88.63999999999999
good joint maybe yeah it's nice

84.4 --> 91.52000000000001
so what have you been up to

88.64 --> 92.88
uh what do you mean uh where do where do

91.52 --> 96.079
i need to start

92.88 --> 99.119
yeah well uh you already

96.079 --> 100.24
told me pretty much that you're you're

99.119 --> 103.2
with the flat earth

100.24 --> 105.119
as it were consider yourself as such and

103.2 --> 109.119
yeah

105.119 --> 112.0
not in the society but i look it up

109.119 --> 113.04
and i look for the information and i'm

112.0 --> 116.56
definitely convinced

113.04 --> 119.84
that the nasa is lying right

116.56 --> 123.84
and all the other space agents uh

119.84 --> 123.84
it's all rubbish and [ __ ] sorry

125.2 --> 131.599
about about four or five years ago

128.239 --> 133.68
um i was already into illuminati and

131.599 --> 135.92
bilderberg and you know all the

133.68 --> 138.72
conspiracy stuff

135.92 --> 139.92
but i was kind of stuck and suddenly

138.72 --> 142.879
someone showed me

139.92 --> 144.48
a youtube link of eric dubay everybody

142.879 --> 147.84
knows him everybody knows

144.48 --> 148.23899999999998
uh that did his investigation that he's

147.84 --> 152.16
paid

148.239 --> 156.16
to do it but um

152.16 --> 159.68
he was on point and i was convinced that

156.16 --> 162.48
the nasa is lying about a lot of stuff

159.68 --> 162.48000000000002
also history

163.44 --> 170.879
and yeah now we are in

166.92 --> 174.319
2019 and it's a big hype

170.879 --> 175.51899999999998
it is kind of isn't it and it's weird

174.319 --> 179.04
because

175.519 --> 181.12
it seems it's still kind of like secret

179.04 --> 182.959
but it's a secret that's like oh yeah we

181.12 --> 184.8
have a secret room too

182.959 --> 186.56
you know it's almost like it's being

184.8 --> 188.08
treated like that yeah we are in on the

186.56 --> 189.76
secret as well you can learn about the

188.08 --> 190.0
secret as well we just can't talk about

189.76 --> 192.48
it

190.0 --> 193.44
in public almost yeah yeah yeah it's so

192.48 --> 196.48
weird

193.44 --> 199.04
yeah yeah it's this kind setup

196.48 --> 200.72
i know the illuminati card deck i don't

199.04 --> 203.84
know if people know about it

200.72 --> 205.04
but um the illuminati what the

203.84 --> 207.12
illuminati card

205.04 --> 209.599
deck it's good right the illuminati

207.12 --> 211.68
cards yeah i remember like

209.599 --> 213.04
mark sergeant and patricia both have one

211.68 --> 216.239
and they always they

213.04 --> 217.28
used to fool around with them i don't

216.239 --> 220.159
know a lot about it

217.28 --> 221.04
so how long have you had a deck oh i

220.159 --> 225.28
don't have to deck

221.04 --> 228.56
i just looked it up on google okay

225.28 --> 228.959
but um one card uh jumped out of it it

228.56 --> 232.239
was

228.959 --> 235.04
uh about flat earthers and yeah

232.239 --> 236.64000000000001
uh probably something yeah we know

235.04 --> 238.879
something

236.64 --> 242.319
and that's the funny thing about it so

238.879 --> 242.319
uh i want to mention it

242.799 --> 249.04000000000002
yeah that's very interesting yeah it is

245.84 --> 252.64000000000001
and it's really on target yes

249.04 --> 254.0
and it's almost to an outsider that is

252.64 --> 256.32
just a complete

254.0 --> 257.919
mystery because they've always learned

256.32 --> 260.079
that flat earthers are stupid

257.919 --> 262.079
it's the first response the inner

260.079 --> 262.72
programmed response it's stupid they're

262.079 --> 264.56
below us

262.72 --> 267.36
we're above us because we don't believe

264.56 --> 269.84
it yeah it's like a tight loop

267.36 --> 271.28000000000003
so when somebody says flat earthers they

269.84 --> 274.4
know something

271.28 --> 277.75899999999996
that's already like what yeah but

274.4 --> 281.35999999999996
that's not right what is that

277.759 --> 283.36
it's very so easy it was so easy for me

281.36 --> 286.40000000000003
to to be convinced because

283.36 --> 287.84000000000003
of all the conspiracies uh you know the

286.4 --> 291.52
georgia guidestones

287.84 --> 294.56
uh about deep population and um

291.52 --> 296.08
i thought by myself so why can't they

294.56 --> 298.32
alter the textbooks

296.08 --> 299.44
on school about the shape of the earth

298.32 --> 301.68
and

299.44 --> 302.56
learning stuff you know they control it

301.68 --> 306.32
so

302.56 --> 308.96
it's possible and after i saw

306.32 --> 311.28
what is possible to change history books

308.96 --> 314.479
and to change um

311.28 --> 315.44
uh the what we know about the shape of

314.479 --> 317.59999999999997
the earth

315.44 --> 319.199
right the history narrative the recorded

317.6 --> 322.72
history just repeat

319.199 --> 326.8
yes definitely and

322.72 --> 330.08000000000004
yeah um it was uh the first time i saw

326.8 --> 330.639
all the earth splash i was like nah that

330.08 --> 333.28
can't be

330.639 --> 333.759
what is this this is this is a joke yeah

333.28 --> 335.19899999999996
it's like

333.759 --> 336.8
it's like in the middle of nowhere

335.199 --> 338.88
you're always like oh the ball

336.8 --> 341.12
space outer space and then so he's like

338.88 --> 344.96
flat earth it's like oh i lost

341.12 --> 347.28000000000003
that yeah i got that response

344.96 --> 348.96
to a couple of times like in the past

347.28 --> 351.52
when i wasn't ready for it's like

348.96 --> 352.96
that early yeah what is that okay and i

351.52 --> 354.88
thought okay that's kind of interesting

352.96 --> 356.96
for fantasy and immediately thought okay

354.88 --> 359.28
i can do something with that

356.96 --> 360.71999999999997
like say in my games or whatever some

359.28 --> 364.55999999999995
fantasy world

360.72 --> 368.24
but i was absolutely unable to accept it

364.56 --> 371.6
at first that it might be actually true

368.24 --> 372.08
because it frightened me the realization

371.6 --> 375.28000000000003
that

372.08 --> 377.19899999999996
the entire world would lie to me for at

375.28 --> 378.0
first thinking that they were all in on

377.199 --> 379.6
it of course

378.0 --> 381.199
automatically assuming that and then

379.6 --> 384.0
later finding out that

381.199 --> 386.16
almost nobody seems to be in on it

384.0 --> 388.72
including the ones fighting for it

386.16 --> 389.84000000000003
very very toughly very hard because they

388.72 --> 392.40000000000003
got weird

389.84 --> 394.479
like almost magical holes in their

392.4 --> 399.52
consciousness that prevents them

394.479 --> 399.52
from understanding why they're wrong

399.84 --> 405.039
while we are around on earth you mean

402.319 --> 406.8
now what the the the hardcore globers

405.039 --> 409.039
they literally have holes in their

406.8 --> 411.84000000000003
conscious where they just cannot

409.039 --> 412.31899999999996
admit cannot let in certain information

411.84 --> 415.039
they are

412.319 --> 416.16
physically psychologically unable it's

415.039 --> 419.68
not a choice

416.16 --> 422.72
they just don't see it they can't see it

419.68 --> 425.12
their consciousness skips those moments

422.72 --> 426.639
everything comes blur and just okay

425.12 --> 429.919
let's continue

426.639 --> 431.599
every time i know yeah

429.919 --> 433.28
sorry well it's because of the brainwash

431.599 --> 436.479
program i mean i was

433.28 --> 438.0
in the same program in the same system

436.479 --> 438.88
as everybody else i'm still in the

438.0 --> 441.919
system i mean

438.88 --> 445.12
i'm not um immune to it

441.919 --> 445.68
but i'll keep it in mind that what we

445.12 --> 448.84000000000003
see

445.68 --> 450.8
what we get in as information by the

448.84 --> 454.79999999999995
mainstream um

450.8 --> 458.08
i always question it always

454.8 --> 459.44
right so it's for me hard to have a

458.08 --> 462.479
normal conversation with

459.44 --> 464.319
with a just a normal regular guy yeah

462.479 --> 468.639
tell me about it

464.319 --> 470.72
although for me the funny thing is

468.639 --> 471.84000000000003
with the way because of the way i am i'm

470.72 --> 475.03900000000004
very out of

471.84 --> 478.0
place almost i'm so contrasting to

475.039 --> 479.36
what nor what regular people do here

478.0 --> 482.879
being all black

479.36 --> 487.52000000000004
wearing those those black boots you know

482.879 --> 489.52000000000004
everybody is like yeah but it causes

487.52 --> 491.75899999999996
more interesting people to come to me

489.52 --> 493.919
that are already questioning reality and

491.759 --> 494.24
thus i have more of these conversations

493.919 --> 497.84
in

494.24 --> 501.36
in instead of just bumping into people

497.84 --> 501.67999999999995
constantly confused and having to work

501.36 --> 504.40000000000003
through

501.68 --> 505.36
everything all the time so because of

504.4 --> 508.71999999999997
the way that i

505.36 --> 512.64
dress i guess and that i compose myself

508.72 --> 515.839
i avoid the bottom layer of delusion

512.64 --> 518.959
okay naturally it helps

515.839 --> 520.0
it helps i don't have to deal with as

518.959 --> 521.8389999999999
much

520.0 --> 526.0
yeah people are there and they and

521.839 --> 526.0
people expect me to actually

526.72 --> 530.5600000000001
yeah where am i the way i am if somebody

529.44 --> 533.44
is

530.56 --> 534.399
going off in some tangent about like but

533.44 --> 537.0400000000001
it's stupid

534.399 --> 538.88
then if i yeah like i on the show get

537.04 --> 541.279
energetic about it

538.88 --> 542.32
in when i'm actually physically present

541.279 --> 545.68
that makes even

542.32 --> 549.6
more impact i guess and people

545.68 --> 553.5999999999999
just yeah they respond a lot better they

549.6 --> 556.9590000000001
don't have the internet in between

553.6 --> 557.9200000000001
to just stave it off and do whatever

556.959 --> 559.8389999999999
they like

557.92 --> 560.959
because i'm physically there and it

559.839 --> 563.2790000000001
means something

560.959 --> 565.1199999999999
when i do something like that and they

563.279 --> 568.399
feel it

565.12 --> 568.399
yeah that's why i'm a follower

569.04 --> 574.56
i mean uh i thought i was

572.16 --> 575.8389999999999
probably the only one in in the

574.56 --> 578.7199999999999
netherlands i know i'm

575.839 --> 580.399
not the only one but in my surroundings

578.72 --> 583.519
um my network

580.399 --> 586.72
nobody believes me and nobody

583.519 --> 590.0
nobody well or maybe not openly

586.72 --> 591.279
you know only one dude that i met in the

590.0 --> 593.839
coffee shop

591.279 --> 594.88
he listened to me and i showed him a few

593.839 --> 596.9590000000001
things

594.88 --> 598.72
and a couple of weeks later you came to

596.959 --> 601.92
me and gave me a bunch of

598.72 --> 605.6
stickers with richard's flat earth

601.92 --> 606.3199999999999
wow you was so convinced what i showed

605.6 --> 609.9200000000001
him

606.32 --> 612.399
uh that he did his own research and

609.92 --> 614.079
uh he had a lot of time on his hands he

612.399 --> 617.36
had no work now he has a job

614.079 --> 620.399
but um yeah he's

617.36 --> 621.76
he's convinced and he's better hold on

620.399 --> 624.32
for a moment so

621.76 --> 625.36
you got a very interesting success story

624.32 --> 628.48
you met a guy

625.36 --> 630.48
who had was out of a job

628.48 --> 632.64
and he had too much time on his hands so

630.48 --> 634.24
you told him about flat earth then he

632.64 --> 635.6
researched flat earth became a flat

634.24 --> 638.72
earth enthusiast

635.6 --> 641.6800000000001
and then he got a job now that's an

638.72 --> 641.6800000000001
interesting story

642.0 --> 648.399
yeah everything is a success

645.04 --> 649.4399999999999
around me i don't know yeah but also

648.399 --> 653.44
that order you know

649.44 --> 655.12
the globers love to always suggest that

653.44 --> 657.44
oh yeah you're only a flat earther

655.12 --> 660.5600000000001
because you don't have a job and

657.44 --> 664.399
but i i have a guess as well

660.56 --> 668.64
so and it was um

664.399 --> 672.16
in same order with my story

668.64 --> 675.4399999999999
before i got a job i also believed

672.16 --> 678.8
in a flat earth and i took

675.44 --> 681.839
like two weeks before i got the job

678.8 --> 683.76
after i knew it yeah

681.839 --> 685.12
it's crazy and i also said it to a

683.76 --> 688.399
girlfriend uh

685.12 --> 690.079
and she really killed me by saying

688.399 --> 691.6
you're out of your mind and i was not

690.079 --> 694.0
talking about flat earth

691.6 --> 695.9200000000001
i was talking about getting the job i

694.0 --> 699.76
had a feeling in my stomach

695.92 --> 703.1999999999999
and she was the only one i told her

699.76 --> 704.3199999999999
and suddenly someone at that location

703.2 --> 708.32
started to

704.32 --> 712.0
shout out to the boss can you work here

708.32 --> 716.0
and yeah one thing left another

712.0 --> 719.68
awesome dude yeah i worked that novel

716.0 --> 720.079
three years i think yeah whoa so you've

719.68 --> 721.92
been

720.079 --> 724.0
awakened to flatter for three years

721.92 --> 727.04
already well

724.0 --> 730.079
i know about it for five years

727.04 --> 732.16
and i uh already

730.079 --> 733.1999999999999
came at the scrapyard that's where i

732.16 --> 736.3199999999999
work

733.2 --> 738.88
and after one and a half years

736.32 --> 740.24
uh i got the feeling that they were

738.88 --> 743.6
starting

740.24 --> 744.0
to grow on me and one of the guys asked

743.6 --> 747.0400000000001
the boss

744.0 --> 747.04
if i can work for them

748.399 --> 754.639
nice but i felt it kind of coming

752.48 --> 754.639
so

755.92 --> 762.399
i don't know yeah

759.04 --> 763.279
it's for me yeah well i don't have like

762.399 --> 767.519
a direct

763.279 --> 770.16
job reference in that sense

767.519 --> 772.0
well when basically i saw flat earth

770.16 --> 774.56
clues for the first time

772.0 --> 775.12
because i had already seen eric debase

774.56 --> 778.4799999999999
stuff

775.12 --> 779.2
in 2011 even though people say it wasn't

778.48 --> 782.16
on there yet

779.2 --> 782.72
not possible okay weird but i've seen

782.16 --> 785.68
the

782.72 --> 786.399
stuff relating to flat earth very a lot

785.68 --> 789.04
of it

786.399 --> 790.399
throughout my life videos even even

789.04 --> 791.92
though that

790.399 --> 793.6
apparently shouldn't be possible or

791.92 --> 797.92
something

793.6 --> 800.0790000000001
and but when it was 2015 really

797.92 --> 801.519
that's the moment that i knew it was

800.079 --> 804.399
like

801.519 --> 805.6
this is i didn't even want it at the

804.399 --> 809.04
time i was afraid

805.6 --> 811.9200000000001
but this is what i'm gonna do i'm gonna

809.04 --> 814.8
talk about this stuff and and i'm gonna

811.92 --> 816.56
hopefully be interesting

814.8 --> 819.04
and i'm gonna continue on and see where

816.56 --> 823.5999999999999
it goes and what i can do with it and

819.04 --> 826.079
how much of the it i can use to actually

823.6 --> 828.0790000000001
put out my good hope and my good will

826.079 --> 830.3199999999999
for the world and

828.079 --> 831.199
my views on how it can change for the

830.32 --> 833.12
better

831.199 --> 834.3199999999999
in a way that maybe other people have

833.12 --> 837.519
overlooked

834.32 --> 841.0400000000001
and it's happening and i

837.519 --> 842.5600000000001
even get paid for it well from voluntary

841.04 --> 845.68
donations

842.56 --> 849.3599999999999
so i can i can say it's a job

845.68 --> 852.6389999999999
although yeah judicially it's not

849.36 --> 854.399
that's just not yet anyway not until i

852.639 --> 856.5600000000001
am monetized and then that of

854.399 --> 859.12
officially that income becomes a job

856.56 --> 860.8
partially so

859.12 --> 863.36
but it's not yeah it's not been

860.8 --> 866.639
confirmed yet

863.36 --> 870.9590000000001
well if you want to make this a job um

866.639 --> 873.6800000000001
you have to do a lot of stuff and

870.959 --> 874.4799999999999
we come with a lot of proven information

873.68 --> 878.88
that

874.48 --> 878.88
the facts aren't facts and

879.36 --> 883.6
the bigger you go eventually you're

881.279 --> 887.4399999999999
gonna have to have a studio and

883.6 --> 889.6800000000001
maybe even crew oh you make it at home

887.44 --> 891.1990000000001
you can make it at home and a lot of

889.68 --> 893.12
stuff i have around here

891.199 --> 895.8389999999999
it's all for free and i do nothing with

893.12 --> 899.76
it oh

895.839 --> 903.2790000000001
okay we can uh maybe meet up

899.76 --> 904.0
soon and yeah i want to also donate some

903.279 --> 907.279
money

904.0 --> 909.04
for your research and i don't want to

907.279 --> 912.16
even talk about

909.04 --> 915.199
the numbers but um

912.16 --> 919.04

in

971.68 --> 975.7589999999999
like say a camera all that so it's gonna

i like to help people out me too we do i

1000.639 --> 1003.44
uh

1001.12 --> 1004.8
as well so yeah i helped someone

1003.44 --> 1007.759
recently um

1004.8 --> 1008.4799999999999
i got i met a guy at work uh he was

1007.759 --> 1011.44
customer

1008.48 --> 1012.32
i always brought a lot of copper and

1011.44 --> 1015.6800000000001
stuff

1012.32 --> 1016.32
but he was homeless and he had a

1015.68 --> 1020.6389999999999
daughter

1016.32 --> 1023.6800000000001
and that touched me so i offered him

1020.639 --> 1024.959
a choice and he was also a drug addict

1023.68 --> 1028.079
oh god

1024.959 --> 1030.959
yeah listen

1028.079 --> 1032.319
he was not a bad guy and i can tell i'm

1030.959 --> 1034.4
i'm sometimes a good

1032.319 --> 1036.079
uh judge of character except when it

1034.4 --> 1039.76
comes to jose sorry

1036.079 --> 1041.12
but it was like um

1039.76 --> 1043.439
he needed a chance and the daughter

1041.12 --> 1046.8799999999999
needed a chance too so i of him

1043.439 --> 1048.4
uh he was losing grip probably gradually

1046.88 --> 1050.96
and you saw that

1048.4 --> 1052.0800000000002
yeah he was very depressed uh he was

1050.96 --> 1055.8400000000001
skinny

1052.08 --> 1059.28
and i wanted to help him and

1055.84 --> 1063.6
i offered him my living space

1059.28 --> 1063.6
gave him like one and a half year

1063.919 --> 1070.48
time of space and i promised him to

1067.919 --> 1072.24
give him control over his financial

1070.48 --> 1075.6
situations

1072.24 --> 1078.84
i promised him to get a apartment and

1075.6 --> 1081.76
i promised him a lot of stuff

1078.84 --> 1084.9599999999998
and

1081.76 --> 1089.12
two boss my boss work uh

1084.96 --> 1092.88
also started to grow on him and yeah

1089.12 --> 1096.0
gradually everything came to its right

1092.88 --> 1097.6000000000001
place and he now has an apartment he now

1096.0 --> 1101.12
has a girlfriend he has

1097.6 --> 1104.24
uh more time with his daughter

1101.12 --> 1106.3999999999999
financially he's cool he's richer than

1104.24 --> 1106.4
me

1107.28 --> 1110.8799999999999
well i was always at work and i told him

1110.08 --> 1114.24
that

1110.88 --> 1117.919
if you cycle around the city and

1114.24 --> 1121.44
you look for dumpsters where

1117.919 --> 1122.48
people are working from building houses

1121.44 --> 1125.76
and stuff

1122.48 --> 1128.72
uh you can ask them if they have uh

1125.76 --> 1130.16
old medals and probably they will give

1128.72 --> 1133.3600000000001
you a bunch of it

1130.16 --> 1136.0
so he took that uh advice

1133.36 --> 1136.559
and yeah he he made a lot of money for

1136.0 --> 1139.36
himself

1136.559 --> 1140.559
and yeah he's now there when he wants to

1139.36 --> 1142.7199999999998
so he completely

1140.559 --> 1144.48
he took the opportunity and got his act

1142.72 --> 1148.559
together magnificently

1144.48 --> 1151.52
wow what a story and

1148.559 --> 1152.32
when i say i'm gonna help you i'm not

1151.52 --> 1155.52
gonna

1152.32 --> 1158.1599999999999
ask money so he lived for free

1155.52 --> 1158.16
at my place

1160.64 --> 1166.48
wow i had to do it otherwise

1164.16 --> 1168.4
it wouldn't work money is always a

1166.48 --> 1170.72
problem

1168.4 --> 1170.72
always

1172.24 --> 1178.32
yeah but

1175.84 --> 1180.24
if you felt you could do it you could

1178.32 --> 1184.0
manage it

1180.24 --> 1184.48
then yeah it worked so it was my best

1184.0 --> 1188.32
feeling

1184.48 --> 1193.84
to help him not for my own yet

1188.32 --> 1193.84
not for my own purposes

1194.559 --> 1201.2
yeah and and he's off the drugs now so

1198.08 --> 1202.1589999999999
that's that's excellent yeah he still

1201.2 --> 1205.28
smokes but

1202.159 --> 1206.88
that's a different story yeah smoking is

1205.28 --> 1210.0
a hard habit

1206.88 --> 1210.0
yeah it definitely is

1210.88 --> 1216.7990000000002
wow well now i i

1214.32 --> 1218.96
truly i can't say that i've ever taken

1216.799 --> 1222.6399999999999
in a homeless person

1218.96 --> 1222.64
although i have

1223.679 --> 1228.4
been nice to them and had good talks

1226.32 --> 1231.039
with homeless people and

1228.4 --> 1233.679
like yeah i gave them like smokes and

1231.039 --> 1237.039
everything if i saw that they were like

1233.679 --> 1238.799
picking ashtrays

1237.039 --> 1241.039
i can't stand to look at that so i'm

1238.799 --> 1244.559
like oh please please please let me

1241.039 --> 1247.36
roll one for you it's like i can see

1244.559 --> 1248.8799999999999
you you dying as you try to smoke that

1247.36 --> 1250.7199999999998
it's just terrible

1248.88 --> 1252.96
so that kind of thing but they are

1250.72 --> 1256.0
actually taking in a guy wow

1252.96 --> 1259.1200000000001
that is yeah maybe if i

1256.0 --> 1260.559
yeah i had a home like i couldn't

1259.12 --> 1263.6
possibly take anyone in

1260.559 --> 1266.559
right now here if i had a

1263.6 --> 1268.08
bigger home and then yeah maybe i could

1266.559 --> 1271.12
do that too i don't know

1268.08 --> 1274.1589999999999
it's i'm i'm very impressed

1271.12 --> 1274.799
very impressed well you got to do what

1274.159 --> 1277.679
you got to do

1274.799 --> 1278.4
sometimes and yeah my nipping space is

1277.679 --> 1282.159
not that big

1278.4 --> 1284.96
i got like 24 uh

1282.159 --> 1286.3200000000002
how do you say uh meters in uh square oh

1284.96 --> 1290.799
it's current meters

1286.32 --> 1293.9189999999999
that was quite meaningless and 24 yeah

1290.799 --> 1296.1589999999999
that's not that bad

1293.919 --> 1298.72
it's too small for what i do and he did

1296.159 --> 1301.6000000000001
the same as me so it was always full of

1298.72 --> 1301.6000000000001
old medals

1302.0 --> 1307.6
but um he's a flat earther as well uh

1305.2 --> 1308.4
i mean if you live uh like one and a

1307.6 --> 1311.52
half years

1308.4 --> 1313.3600000000001
around me every evening i got a flat

lot aren't you yeah or something that's

1319.36 --> 1323.76
relevant to it

1320.48 --> 1326.799
yeah uh do we go

1323.76 --> 1327.52
in all directions uh like the mud flood

1326.799 --> 1329.6
and

1327.52 --> 1330.96
yeah yeah sure yeah what else is out

1329.6 --> 1334.7199999999998
there my god

1330.96 --> 1337.2

closely uh on google earth you will see

1337.2 --> 1341.039
uh

1337.84 --> 1342.9599999999998
a dead dragon uh petrified flying from

1341.039 --> 1346.08

morocco it's crazy stuff

1346.08 --> 1351.36
yeah it's it's it's it's not like uh

1349.12 --> 1356.0
you're gonna see what you wanna see

1351.36 --> 1358.8799999999999
but it's if you look very closely and

1356.0 --> 1359.6
uh do not pay attention to uh evolution

1358.88 --> 1362.88
theories

1359.6 --> 1365.039
and stuff you're gonna see that dragon

1362.88 --> 1366.24

1365.039 --> 1370.0
dragon

1366.24 --> 1371.2

1375.36 --> 1378.7199999999998
how do you do that yeah if you got it on

1377.679 --> 1380.48
your computer or

1378.72 --> 1383.1200000000001
however you're interfacing then you

1434.96 --> 1439.679
confirm then it presents yeah a few

1437.76 --> 1445.84
screens over here so i can

1439.679 --> 1445.8400000000001
easily yeah

1446.08 --> 1451.6789999999999
um something visible

1449.6 --> 1452.7199999999998
yeah but you're presenting the mains ah

1451.679 --> 1456.3200000000002
right

1452.72 --> 1456.32
be careful not to present

1457.039 --> 1461.52
you seeing this yeah yeah you're

1459.84 --> 1461.9189999999999
presenting but you're going all over the

1461.52 --> 1463.44
place

1461.919 --> 1465.919
i'm not gonna put it on the big screen

1463.44 --> 1465.919
just yet

1467.2 --> 1470.72
we're now presenting the google hangout

1469.12 --> 1472.9599999999998
screen

1470.72 --> 1473.84
oh how do you uh what's the next step

1472.96 --> 1477.52
then

1473.84 --> 1479.4399999999998
uh well unpresented again so just click

1477.52 --> 1480.72
click the green again so it goes away

1479.44 --> 1482.88
and then try again and

1480.72 --> 1484.48
this time be sure to pick the right

1482.88 --> 1486.88
screen

1484.48 --> 1489.1200000000001
and then when you do that you all i

1486.88 --> 1490.4
think you also automatically switch to

1489.12 --> 1492.3999999999999
that

1490.4 --> 1495.2
to that window i'm not too sure about it

1492.4 --> 1495.2
but i think so

1497.279 --> 1504.88
this one yes

1501.2 --> 1504.88
okay hold on i'll put you on

1506.32 --> 1513.52
wow yeah yeah

1509.679 --> 1515.52
okay okay so i'm gonna do this uh

1513.52 --> 1518.0
without the voiceover of

1515.52 --> 1519.039
the original upload i'm gonna do it my

1518.0 --> 1522.24
own way

1519.039 --> 1525.2
if you uh watch uh

1522.24 --> 1526.32
the middle of the screen it's all

1525.2 --> 1529.919
tangibles

1526.32 --> 1531.36
going outwards and it looks kind of

1529.919 --> 1534.4
organic doesn't it

1531.36 --> 1538.08
looks to me like a a cut

1534.4 --> 1539.919
through section of a broccoli really

1538.08 --> 1541.12
well at least it's organic in your

1539.919 --> 1544.3200000000002
opinion

1541.12 --> 1547.9189999999999
yeah organic broccoli yeah

1544.32 --> 1551.2
it's like it's under a microscope

1547.919 --> 1554.8400000000001
could be yeah possibility

1551.2 --> 1556.0
uh if i push play the guy's gonna zoom

1554.84 --> 1558.32
out

1556.0 --> 1558.32
um

1559.2 --> 1563.1200000000001
he's pointing out the stuff that i said

1561.679 --> 1565.8400000000001
you know yeah but

1563.12 --> 1566.6399999999999
please just try not to play the entire

1565.84 --> 1570.1589999999999
video but

1566.64 --> 1570.159
switch to the relevant moments

1572.0 --> 1575.76
it's a four minute video okay it's not

1575.12 --> 1578.0
that long

1575.76 --> 1578.0
but

1579.279 --> 1582.48
let's move to the next frame now he's

1581.039 --> 1585.6
zooming out ah

1582.48 --> 1588.24
right right right still looks kind of

1585.6 --> 1589.52
kind of organic well that way it looks

1588.24 --> 1592.159
like earth

1589.52 --> 1593.44
oh right the chinese chinese dragon's

1592.159 --> 1597.5200000000002
head

1593.44 --> 1602.3200000000002
yes i see it now that's very macro

1597.52 --> 1604.559
that's very big interesting

1602.32 --> 1606.1589999999999
and everyone can do this on google earth

1604.559 --> 1608.08
it's not fake

1606.159 --> 1609.5200000000002
it's not fake it's it's available for

1608.08 --> 1612.48
everyone

1609.52 --> 1613.76
but because of the brainwashing program

1612.48 --> 1615.76
nobody keeps

1613.76 --> 1618.1589999999999
in mind there are maybe dragons around

1615.76 --> 1620.4
you know nah

1618.159 --> 1621.2
no this is not that's not a dragon it's

1620.4 --> 1623.919
really just

1621.2 --> 1625.6000000000001
a an ink stain on a piece of paper in

1623.919 --> 1627.1200000000001
this case on a very large scale that

1625.6 --> 1630.1589999999999
makes it look like that

1627.12 --> 1632.1589999999999
but there's no direct physical shape of

1630.159 --> 1633.5200000000002
a dragon you know that's

1632.159 --> 1635.44
you're not gonna get that from a

1633.52 --> 1637.36
top-down picture

1635.44 --> 1638.88
in my opinion although there are some

1637.36 --> 1642.1589999999999
locations where it

1638.88 --> 1645.5200000000002
does really seem like a physical object

1642.159 --> 1648.88
okay so what about giant trees have you

1645.52 --> 1652.0
have you looked into that

1648.88 --> 1654.7990000000002
sorry have you looked into the

1652.0 --> 1657.679
subject giant trees yeah yeah yeah

1654.799 --> 1661.76
that's one of those examples that i said

1657.679 --> 1664.0
there seemed more likely and also other

1661.76 --> 1664.799
amazing sights where it seems almost

1664.0 --> 1669.36
like

1664.799 --> 1671.9189999999999
giant tree parts that had fell over

1669.36 --> 1673.36
petrified and became mountains basically

1671.919 --> 1675.6000000000001
the branches became

1673.36 --> 1678.8799999999999
that's exactly how it looks even

1675.6 --> 1682.559
specific types of trees

1678.88 --> 1682.96
like with the nerves of the exactly like

1682.559 --> 1686.8799999999999
this

1682.96 --> 1688.24
crazy saw that on on jay dreamers

1686.88 --> 1691.6000000000001
there's a lot of weird stuff that he

1688.24 --> 1694.159
shows but that's one of those things

1691.6 --> 1697.279
yeah there might have been super super

1694.159 --> 1700.0
giant creatures in

1697.279 --> 1700.88
in the pre-atlantic era that have all

1700.0 --> 1702.799
died and

1700.88 --> 1705.5200000000002
turned to stone and became part of

1702.799 --> 1709.279
landscape yep

1705.52 --> 1711.84
i do not exclude the possibility at

1709.279 --> 1713.279
well i all uh i found this picture i

1711.84 --> 1717.84
don't know

1713.279 --> 1719.84
do you see it yeah i see it

1717.84 --> 1721.9189999999999
and that's why i believe this is that

1719.84 --> 1725.4399999999998
dragon

1721.919 --> 1728.3990000000001
all right well if i see

1725.44 --> 1730.0
something that would look remarkably

1728.399 --> 1732.399
like a dragon

1730.0 --> 1734.399
and it could be visible to be as such

1732.399 --> 1735.9189999999999
just like in this photograph

1734.399 --> 1737.6
when you're looking at from the side and

1735.919 --> 1738.0
not top down then i might be more

1737.6 --> 1740.559
inclined

1738.0 --> 1741.84
to believe it but the top-down view that

1740.559 --> 1744.1589999999999
showed the dragon

1741.84 --> 1746.08
it was basically like an ink stain

1744.159 --> 1748.48
because that is so large it is all

1746.08 --> 1750.8799999999999
relatively almost perfectly flat

1748.48 --> 1752.0
so it's just an image that appears to be

1750.88 --> 1755.679
like the shape of the dragon

1752.0 --> 1759.039
it's not actually the real yeah of a 3d

1755.679 --> 1760.3200000000002
dragon bear it's not the same thing

1759.039 --> 1763.44
really

1760.32 --> 1763.4399999999998
oh yeah interesting

1764.08 --> 1768.0
and there is a lot some more i know i

1766.96 --> 1770.24
know there's

1768.0 --> 1772.24
huge amounts of that kind of stuff i

1770.24 --> 1774.24
also got a picture for the patrols

1772.24 --> 1776.64
among us and it looks like an elephant's

1774.24 --> 1777.279
head i've got also a picture for the

1776.64 --> 1781.8400000000001
trolls

1777.279 --> 1781.84
okay just a sec

1788.159 --> 1790.5590000000002
okay

1791.44 --> 1795.52
uh you might want to put that away

1793.36 --> 1800.799
before i get flagged

1795.52 --> 1800.799
okay sorry it was stoned i know

1802.159 --> 1805.44
okay i'm gonna i'm gonna shake your hand

1804.399 --> 1808.9599999999998
now and

1805.44 --> 1813.2
listen to this

1808.96 --> 1816.3990000000001
so yeah i can't deny this stuff

1813.2 --> 1819.44
it's out there right indeed

1816.399 --> 1822.399
there's incredible stuff out there

1819.44 --> 1823.8400000000001
and hey i if there's one thing i want to

1822.399 --> 1826.399
do when it concerns

1823.84 --> 1828.24
things like traveling oh yeah that's

1826.399 --> 1830.08
what i want to do i want to find the

1828.24 --> 1832.72
special things i want to

1830.08 --> 1833.84
and i want to [ __ ] live stream it

1832.72 --> 1837.76
okay

1833.84 --> 1841.1999999999998
yeah just are we on the road

1837.76 --> 1844.48
are we in the bushes yeah stream it all

1841.2 --> 1845.039
absolutely yeah or at least take footage

1844.48 --> 1848.159
and then

1845.039 --> 1850.08
show it you know you can't always stream

1848.159 --> 1853.3600000000001
live in the middle of nowhere

1850.08 --> 1857.1999999999998
wi-fi doesn't really go that far no no

1853.36 --> 1857.1999999999998
no there are no satellites in space

1858.48 --> 1862.3990000000001
oh well maybe i could launch a special

1860.64 --> 1864.72
satellite

1862.399 --> 1866.559
okay guys if you all fund me for a

1864.72 --> 1869.1200000000001
couple of hundred millions then i can

1866.559 --> 1870.48
pay nasa to launch a special satellite

1869.12 --> 1873.84
so i can

1870.48 --> 1876.88
explore and live stream it what about

1873.84 --> 1881.84
what do you say oh please just

1876.88 --> 1885.0390000000002
see the camera on it without fisheye

1881.84 --> 1888.799
no just kidding now

1885.039 --> 1890.96
although i i've also speculated about

1888.799 --> 1892.08
what would be problematic because i

1890.96 --> 1894.96
would be probably

1892.08 --> 1896.8799999999999
interfere with the information network

1894.96 --> 1898.3990000000001
the ones in charge but yeah you could

1896.88 --> 1902.0
make your own

1898.399 --> 1904.2399999999998
relay as you go

1902.0 --> 1904.24
like

1905.6 --> 1910.24
i guess you could put up towers with

1908.88 --> 1913.279
relays that would just

1910.24 --> 1916.72
relay transmissions for

1913.279 --> 1919.36
a specific device that it is like laying

1916.72 --> 1921.76
an internet line but with

1919.36 --> 1922.7199999999998
with yeah transmission towers instead of

1921.76 --> 1925.84
literally uh

1922.72 --> 1929.919
unrolling a giant you mean what's uh

1925.84 --> 1933.6789999999999
invented you mean what tesla invented

1929.919 --> 1934.0800000000002
no not that well no not necessarily it's

1933.679 --> 1937.1200000000001
just

1934.08 --> 1939.84
basic technology really it's just relays

1937.12 --> 1940.8799999999999
just but dropping your own relays in the

1939.84 --> 1944.08
wild

1940.88 --> 1946.3200000000002
oh as a as a line

1944.08 --> 1948.6399999999999
as a connection line so you can live

1946.32 --> 1951.6789999999999
stream through that line

1948.64 --> 1954.3990000000001
yeah some kind of civilization just

1951.679 --> 1955.279
move into the wild and just drop these

1954.399 --> 1958.32
red car

1955.279 --> 1959.36
the breadcrumb relays yeah yeah so you

1958.32 --> 1961.6789999999999
can keep on

1959.36 --> 1962.8799999999999
through that connection that you've laid

1961.679 --> 1965.039
yeah

1962.88 --> 1968.159
yeah that's something that might be

1965.039 --> 1969.679
doable i'd like to try that

1968.159 --> 1972.24
but yeah are you going to get permission

1969.679 --> 1975.8400000000001
for that and

1972.24 --> 1976.32
just do it maybe would be interesting if

1975.84 --> 1978.6399999999999
you could

1976.32 --> 1981.039
do it like with partial drones like a

1978.64 --> 1984.159
relay that you could also

1981.039 --> 1986.32
communicate with like okay now deploy

1984.159 --> 1988.96
and fly all to this location so you

1986.32 --> 1993.12
don't have to pick up every single relay

1988.96 --> 1993.1200000000001
or be fine for littering

1994.08 --> 1998.08
yeah a drone relay that can just plant

1996.96 --> 2000.64
itself and just

1998.08 --> 2004.08
be the relay and then it's like okay

2000.64 --> 2007.2
unified command okay deploy and it just

2004.08 --> 2010.559
poop it also helps fighting

2007.2 --> 2011.919
pollution it also helps fighting

2010.559 --> 2013.76
pollution

2011.919 --> 2015.76
technology doesn't have to be bad

2013.76 --> 2018.399
absolutely

2015.76 --> 2019.76
but that's the whole trick isn't it yeah

2018.399 --> 2023.12
we can use it for

2019.76 --> 2023.919
freedom and excellence and glory and

2023.12 --> 2026.1589999999999
they

2023.919 --> 2028.3200000000002
can do that too but they always like to

2026.159 --> 2031.2
go a little bit too far and actually

2028.32 --> 2031.9189999999999
use it to [ __ ] us up and to derail us

2031.2 --> 2035.519
and to

2031.919 --> 2039.44
fool us and to make us

2035.519 --> 2040.799
back for mercy and slavery

2039.44 --> 2043.44
that's what they like to do with

2040.799 --> 2047.679
technology

2043.44 --> 2050.8
but yeah i think it's doable

2047.679 --> 2053.04
and if i'm not careful then probably

2050.8 --> 2056.079
some company is gonna

2053.04 --> 2058.0
present a device just like this in a

2056.079 --> 2061.679
month's time and just make

2058.0 --> 2064.96
billions of dollars with that [ __ ]

2061.679 --> 2066.96
but i uh i don't know don't have to be

2064.96 --> 2069.839
the one that brought it on the market

2066.96 --> 2072.8
but i would love to be the one using it

2069.839 --> 2074.399
so maybe i can make it myself or maybe

2072.8 --> 2076.8
the market will just

2074.399 --> 2079.919
start creating these things you know

2076.8 --> 2082.079
drones are so easily mass produced

2079.919 --> 2083.5989999999997
internet wi-fi things are so easily

2082.079 --> 2086.159
mass-produced what you do

2083.599 --> 2086.639
you take a drone you put a wi-fi relay

2086.159 --> 2088.7200000000003
on it

2086.639 --> 2090.48
you make a deploy system so it can

2088.72 --> 2091.359
basically sit and not drain its

2090.48 --> 2093.839
batteries

2091.359 --> 2094.639
because if it's flying all the time and

2093.839 --> 2100.0789999999997
yeah done

2094.639 --> 2100.079
it's super easy super super easy

2102.71 --> 2105.78
[Music]

2109.119 --> 2114.56
the temporary drone relay live stream

2114.839 --> 2119.2799999999997
system for in the wilds

2117.2 --> 2120.3199999999997
anyway yeah well that's one of these

2119.28 --> 2123.3590000000004
things

2120.32 --> 2126.2400000000002
that i'd like like to work out see how

2123.359 --> 2128.72
how much would it cost to do that and

2126.24 --> 2131.9199999999996
how many of those devices would you have

2128.72 --> 2135.04
would you need to go over a certain

2131.92 --> 2135.04
range as it were

2135.119 --> 2138.7200000000003
i got a i've got a drone lying here

2137.359 --> 2142.24
around a small one

2138.72 --> 2143.2799999999997
mini it still works it needs a bit of

2142.24 --> 2145.4399999999996
fixing

2143.28 --> 2146.8
but maybe you can build a prototype with

2145.44 --> 2149.599
it

2146.8 --> 2149.599
you got to bend it

2151.04 --> 2157.68
okay that's interesting

2154.16 --> 2161.839
i don't know how wi-fi works how you can

2157.68 --> 2165.839
set up a small package that fits in

2161.839 --> 2170.16
the drawer jesus well you're

2165.839 --> 2170.16
okay you're taking this very serious

2170.4 --> 2173.92
you won't but now there are some limits

2173.2 --> 2176.3199999999997
but

2173.92 --> 2177.2000000000003
there's a lot of possible possibilities

2176.32 --> 2179.76
and

2177.2 --> 2180.3199999999997
well we'd have to get somebody in on it

2179.76 --> 2183.92
who

2180.32 --> 2185.839
knows everything about wi-fi connections

2183.92 --> 2187.92
because that is a thing and it's a i

2185.839 --> 2190.16
know a guy but i don't but do we have to

2187.92 --> 2192.0
talk to him anymore

2190.16 --> 2193.359
but but do we have the time because a

2192.0 --> 2196.64
lot of people are talking about

2193.359 --> 2198.3199999999997
end time it's been talking about that

2196.64 --> 2201.2799999999997
for hundreds of years so

2198.32 --> 2202.32
yeah i know but a lot of things from the

2201.28 --> 2205.6800000000003
bible scripture

2202.32 --> 2208.7200000000003
are uh exactly what is happening

2205.68 --> 2211.52
right now right and who do you think

2208.72 --> 2211.52
made it like that

2212.0 --> 2218.8
good question

2215.2 --> 2220.72
i think that much let me get in some

2218.8 --> 2222.5600000000004
blasphemous territory okay i talked

2220.72 --> 2223.04
about it earlier if the bible could be

2222.56 --> 2224.72
changed

2223.04 --> 2226.079
it has been changed irrationally

2224.72 --> 2227.9199999999996
suddenly wine bottles

2226.079 --> 2229.2000000000003
when they obviously did not exist and

2227.92 --> 2232.32
more to come

2229.2 --> 2232.96
who says these end times are even real

2232.32 --> 2236.56
who says

2232.96 --> 2239.92
they are not the design of the elites

2236.56 --> 2241.2
to wrap it all up and it actually has

2239.92 --> 2244.4
nothing to do

2241.2 --> 2248.3199999999997
with the path of christ at all

2244.4 --> 2248.88
you know like jones entertained this he

2248.32 --> 2250.7200000000003
said like

2248.88 --> 2253.04
look look at the bible it's all coming

2250.72 --> 2256.72
true so yeah whether

2253.04 --> 2259.92
they are using it as a handbook

2256.72 --> 2264.24
if it's real it's happening but

2259.92 --> 2268.48
yeah he said it maybe they are actually

2264.24 --> 2272.9599999999996
applying it yes exactly

2268.48 --> 2272.96
look at the georgia guide stones please

2274.32 --> 2277.44
they are making end times happen on

2276.72 --> 2280.64
purpose

2277.44 --> 2282.56
to panic us to make us say okay

2280.64 --> 2284.64
it's all over anyway let's just have a

2282.56 --> 2286.4
party and just throw away our money

2284.64 --> 2287.68
don't care if it's gonna be abused

2286.4 --> 2291.04
against us

2287.68 --> 2294.0
yeah that's the trick it's it's a heist

2291.04 --> 2294.8
it's a spiritual heist and what they are

2294.0 --> 2297.92
afraid of

2294.8 --> 2299.28
is we going to revolt and it's not going

2297.92 --> 2300.96
to be televised

2299.28 --> 2302.88
right because who's going to revolt if

2300.96 --> 2307.04
everyone's going to die anyway you know

2302.88 --> 2310.8
yeah so we have to be in front of that

2307.04 --> 2314.64
indeed and if christ is going to come

2310.8 --> 2317.52
it's gonna be in us that's well said

2314.64 --> 2318.4
yes well i don't think that christ as a

2317.52 --> 2321.52
physical

2318.4 --> 2324.56
entity will come back he's still there

2321.52 --> 2326.72
he's there on the other side and he gave

2324.56 --> 2329.04
us the example and if there's going to

2326.72 --> 2332.8799999999997
be a return of christ it is going to be

2329.04 --> 2334.88
the spirit within individuals

2332.88 --> 2335.92
and the more individuals that carry it

2334.88 --> 2338.1600000000003
and do it right

2335.92 --> 2339.599
the stronger the spirit becomes the more

2338.16 --> 2341.92
unified

2339.599 --> 2343.3590000000004
the more impervious and that is the

2341.92 --> 2348.0
return of christ

2343.359 --> 2351.04
no through us all yeah i also think that

2348.0 --> 2355.119
the part of lifting the veil

2351.04 --> 2356.4
i mean if you look at the illuminati

2355.119 --> 2359.04
card deck

2356.4 --> 2360.32
uh the flat earth card is in that deck

2359.04 --> 2362.4
in that game

2360.32 --> 2364.56
so it's all tied together if you connect

2362.4 --> 2367.44
the dots like david ike said

2364.56 --> 2368.56
i mean he's a gay keeper i know now but

2367.44 --> 2370.96
who

2368.56 --> 2374.32
there's a lot of conspiracy going around

2370.96 --> 2374.32
by this freemasons and

2374.64 --> 2378.24
look david ike may be a gatekeeper but

2377.28 --> 2382.0
he's

2378.24 --> 2383.9199999999996
i i did oh he look look hold on there's

2382.0 --> 2386.88
a gatekeeper that keeps the door

2383.92 --> 2387.839
closed and attacks you as you try to

2386.88 --> 2391.44
pass through it

2387.839 --> 2393.359
or just a guy standing at that gate

2391.44 --> 2394.8
and having an infra a piece of

2393.359 --> 2396.88
information

2394.8 --> 2399.119
and not obstructing you from moving

2396.88 --> 2400.079
beyond and that is david ike he doesn't

2399.119 --> 2402.88
tell you

2400.079 --> 2404.0
don't question this how dare you you

2402.88 --> 2405.76
must be crazy

2404.0 --> 2407.52
yeah he sometimes walks away it's like

2405.76 --> 2409.8390000000004
oh my god this is too much heat

2407.52 --> 2411.52
i i'm not prepared to handle this [ __ ]

2409.839 --> 2414.7999999999997
from the top down

2411.52 --> 2417.28
right now yeah so but he's not telling

2414.8 --> 2419.76
anyone not to move further

2417.28 --> 2421.119
and he's actually saying like yeah wow

2419.76 --> 2423.76
it's going so far

2421.119 --> 2425.44
out there so many things good things and

2423.76 --> 2430.5600000000004
insane things

2425.44 --> 2433.92
and yes he knows but

2430.56 --> 2439.839
but okay um we mentioned david i

2433.92 --> 2439.839
know i did uh i reptilians real

2440.96 --> 2447.52
uh well it depends i think

2444.8 --> 2449.8390000000004
it depends on the perspective look uh

2447.52 --> 2451.44
david ike's conceptualization of

2449.839 --> 2454.72
reptilians

2451.44 --> 2458.4
is very interesting and it may be a mix

2454.72 --> 2460.4399999999996
up because i think that reptilians

2458.4 --> 2462.0
as he conceptualized could be the

2460.44 --> 2466.319
interdimensional

2462.0 --> 2468.319
entities that can take control of humans

2466.319 --> 2470.079
which would be the royal bloodline which

2468.319 --> 2472.319
is most susceptible to it and it was

2470.079 --> 2473.76
engineered to do like that i think that

2472.319 --> 2475.44
is absolutely correct

2473.76 --> 2477.6800000000003
where the actual reptilian

2475.44 --> 2479.52
shape-shifting thing comes in

2477.68 --> 2481.2
that's another story i think that is

2479.52 --> 2484.0
just to make it a little bit more

2481.2 --> 2487.04
exciting and interesting and movie-like

2484.0 --> 2490.48
but the other part yeah

2487.04 --> 2494.319
i don't have a doubt about it

2490.48 --> 2497.44
because i got confused by the bible

2494.319 --> 2500.48
and um i

2497.44 --> 2501.52
also found a channel on youtube of

2500.48 --> 2504.88
martin kenny

2501.52 --> 2508.48
i don't know if you read them sorry

2504.88 --> 2511.6800000000003
martin kenny do you know that name

2508.48 --> 2515.52
he's also into flat earth but

2511.68 --> 2516.0789999999997
he made a model and i know a lot of

2515.52 --> 2519.2
people

2516.079 --> 2523.76
are not happy with models but

2519.2 --> 2527.359
he had an interesting background

2523.76 --> 2530.6400000000003
he has a lot of degrees in studies of

2527.359 --> 2535.52
ancient history real history

2530.64 --> 2538.72
and he he was talking about

2535.52 --> 2541.7599999999998
ice rings with land in between

2538.72 --> 2545.359
and four regions of this

2541.76 --> 2549.2000000000003
and with different races

2545.359 --> 2552.72
also reptilians shape shifters

2549.2 --> 2557.5989999999997
okay well you know

2552.72 --> 2560.68
look with the concept of more realms

2557.599 --> 2561.839
every [ __ ] freaking thing you can

2560.68 --> 2563.359
conceptualize

2561.839 --> 2564.56
could be out there there could be giants

2563.359 --> 2566.24
out there could be dwarves out there

2564.56 --> 2568.88
could be a race of elves out there

2566.24 --> 2569.4399999999996
it could be literal grey aliens out

2568.88 --> 2573.599
there

2569.44 --> 2576.2400000000002
could be reptile v

2573.599 --> 2578.079
reptiles remember that's where it

2576.24 --> 2581.839
started the v

2578.079 --> 2584.8
in the 80s that terrifying series of

2581.839 --> 2586.56
reptiles basically having human skins

2584.8 --> 2590.4
and invading the world

2586.56 --> 2594.16
yeah it could all be out there all of it

2590.4 --> 2597.119
but armin could have been out there

2594.16 --> 2599.359
ivan that's why i want to travel but the

2597.119 --> 2602.7200000000003
treaty you know about the treaty the uh

2599.359 --> 2604.88
the treaty yes well

2602.72 --> 2606.0
you think it might be there for a good

2604.88 --> 2608.0
reason especially

2606.0 --> 2609.839
bringing in this because if there are

2608.0 --> 2613.76
other realms

2609.839 --> 2615.839
then you think that we're allowed to

2613.76 --> 2616.88
maybe this treaty is for the other

2615.839 --> 2619.2799999999997
realms

2616.88 --> 2620.1600000000003
and they're just like no we will not

2619.28 --> 2623.76
allow

2620.16 --> 2626.24
humans to come here because you screw

2623.76 --> 2626.96
everything up with your insane delusions

2626.24 --> 2630.64
and you're all

2626.96 --> 2631.52
fools okay and you know about the north

2630.64 --> 2634.96
pole the center

2631.52 --> 2638.16
the uh um

2634.96 --> 2639.119
i don't know if it's the center ah me

2638.16 --> 2642.8799999999997
neither but

2639.119 --> 2647.28
i'm on a travel man i got my passport

2642.88 --> 2649.52
so yeah so do i but yeah

2647.28 --> 2651.2000000000003
but there's still some other things i'd

2649.52 --> 2655.04
like to figure out first

2651.2 --> 2657.68
like is the equator a straight line

2655.04 --> 2659.2
yeah and once you know that for with

2657.68 --> 2662.8799999999997
absolute certainty

2659.2 --> 2663.2
then you have parameters to work by as

2662.88 --> 2665.6800000000003
you

2663.2 --> 2665.68
explore

2666.319 --> 2673.04
because yeah is it a looping

2669.68 --> 2674.48
thing is it the looping square rectangle

2673.04 --> 2677.599
looping

2674.48 --> 2681.2
irregular bead shaped or is it a disc

2677.599 --> 2683.76
with more outside or is it just

2681.2 --> 2684.8799999999997
completely spatially warped all over the

2683.76 --> 2687.8390000000004
place is it like

2684.88 --> 2687.839
a top hat

2688.079 --> 2694.2400000000002
like charlie chaplin top hat of all

2691.359 --> 2697.359
flatness irregularly in connected non

2694.24 --> 2697.359
spatial linear

2698.0 --> 2702.64
freaking hell nose you mean no dome and

2700.56 --> 2707.119
infinite space

2702.64 --> 2707.1189999999997
no no the way the land is interconnected

2708.56 --> 2713.359
okay you do

2711.599 --> 2714.6400000000003
know about the rectangular looping

2713.359 --> 2718.7999999999997
concept and

2714.64 --> 2721.839
and we made it right no oh my god

2718.8 --> 2724.1600000000003
okay dude you need to look up

2721.839 --> 2724.96
some of my hangouts from flat earth

2724.16 --> 2727.359
talks

2724.96 --> 2729.44
that's what i told you in private i i

2727.359 --> 2732.16
have a lot catching up to do

2729.44 --> 2733.04
right right yeah if i'd explain the

2732.16 --> 2735.5989999999997
sorry sorry

2733.04 --> 2736.96
yeah well okay then what i just said is

2735.599 --> 2739.76
just like what

2736.96 --> 2741.359
i guess yeah because it is very complex

2739.76 --> 2744.8390000000004
and it is

2741.359 --> 2748.16
requires a certain level of explanation

2744.839 --> 2751.359
but let's continue the other subject

2748.16 --> 2754.64
of exploration yeah

2751.359 --> 2755.04
i definitely want to explore but i have

2754.64 --> 2758.7999999999997
to

2755.04 --> 2762.16
understand the parameters of why

2758.8 --> 2765.44
first you know i i'm not i

2762.16 --> 2768.48
i i just don't want to do this i don't

2765.44 --> 2772.0
want to just defy this

2768.48 --> 2772.96
law without truly understanding why it's

2772.0 --> 2775.68
there

2772.96 --> 2778.7200000000003
and i refuse to accept that it's just

2775.68 --> 2781.68
this superficial thing

2778.72 --> 2783.52
you know there must be a wider reason

2781.68 --> 2785.68
for it if there is more out there

2783.52 --> 2787.119
there must be a wider reason and i need

2785.68 --> 2790.319
to know that before i

2787.119 --> 2792.319
start to just defy them without actually

2790.319 --> 2794.72
knowing what i'm really defying

2792.319 --> 2797.2799999999997
because that is just idiocy that's

2794.72 --> 2797.2799999999997
reckless

2799.68 --> 2805.9199999999996
so maybe we could explore

2802.72 --> 2809.2
this realm first in

2805.92 --> 2811.28
the exploration process learn more about

2809.2 --> 2814.16
how to explore

2811.28 --> 2814.88
and learn more about what whatever maybe

2814.16 --> 2817.44
out there

2814.88 --> 2818.2400000000002
could be because of what we discover

2817.44 --> 2822.4
here

2818.24 --> 2826.16
of the nature of this world is it

2822.4 --> 2828.88
spatially linear is it really or

2826.16 --> 2831.1189999999997
is there provable spatial non-linearity

2828.88 --> 2832.4
present which makes things a lot more

2831.119 --> 2834.8
complex

2832.4 --> 2835.44
you know how does this realm work what

2834.8 --> 2838.5600000000004
is it

2835.44 --> 2840.64
what is it really let's measure it

2838.56 --> 2841.68
measure it with a measuring stick no

2840.64 --> 2845.839
coordinate

2841.68 --> 2849.1189999999997
comparisons to maps and oh look oh looks

2845.839 --> 2852.64
oh the gps says that this is must

2849.119 --> 2855.599
know let's put an actual ruler there

2852.64 --> 2855.5989999999997
and measure it

2856.0 --> 2861.839
every freaking piece of it

2859.04 --> 2862.319
i wish we had the freedom for this i

2861.839 --> 2864.7999999999997
think

2862.319 --> 2864.8
we do

2865.44 --> 2869.76
in our realms i think we do in our realm

2868.24 --> 2872.3999999999996
i think i would not

2869.76 --> 2872.96
measure it but i mean we got a lot of

2872.4 --> 2875.839
people

2872.96 --> 2877.28
that are not happy about what we are

2875.839 --> 2880.0789999999997
talking about

2877.28 --> 2882.3190000000004
if you mention barack obama he mentioned

2880.079 --> 2884.1600000000003
a lot of times we don't have time for a

2882.319 --> 2886.079
flat earth society yeah because they

2884.16 --> 2889.7599999999998
want to destroy the world

2886.079 --> 2891.3590000000004
yeah but for them sorry we have better

2889.76 --> 2893.92
things to do

2891.359 --> 2895.359
and besides these people i don't think

2893.92 --> 2900.8
they're going to be

2895.359 --> 2903.44
around much longer to be fair

2900.8 --> 2903.8390000000004
well they're pushing it too hard and

2903.44 --> 2907.2000000000003
they

2903.839 --> 2909.92
too are having their death blue moment

2907.2 --> 2912.24
where they go completely nero ape [ __ ]

2909.92 --> 2914.64
insane in public and think everything is

2912.24 --> 2918.16
all right and they're winning

2914.64 --> 2920.96
and that's just a sign that's gonna be

2918.16 --> 2922.319
it's gonna be over very quickly one way

2920.96 --> 2927.28
or the other

2922.319 --> 2931.599
so it depends more on what

2927.28 --> 2931.599
the factions taking over will do

2932.079 --> 2936.7200000000003
and this is kind of my long-term fear

2936.88 --> 2944.559
that they may be so

2940.04 --> 2947.44
infatuated and dependent on the

2944.559 --> 2949.52
going to mars agenda and going along

2947.44 --> 2952.079
with nasa that they may actually go

2949.52 --> 2954.559
nazi on us flat earthers that's my

2952.079 --> 2957.76
greatest fear

2954.559 --> 2961.3590000000004
and it would be very sad because

2957.76 --> 2964.8
we could we could go on you know

2961.359 --> 2967.92
pima camps are already here right

2964.8 --> 2970.8
well they're always

2967.92 --> 2972.16
there for whatever reason yeah but

2970.8 --> 2975.04
they're still empty but i don't think

2972.16 --> 2978.0789999999997
that the fema camps really

2975.04 --> 2979.68
yeah they're too big just to be built

2978.079 --> 2981.44
for a bunch of flat earthers

2979.68 --> 2984.0
i think the fema camps were built for

2981.44 --> 2984.0
everyone

2988.96 --> 2993.119
but it's also with the the the bible

2991.68 --> 2994.8799999999997
scripture and the mark of the beast you

2993.119 --> 2996.079
know we're gonna receive the chip in the

2994.88 --> 2999.92
hand to play with

2996.079 --> 3004.1600000000003
uh uh some kind of money look hold on

2999.92 --> 3007.359
hold on who's who wrote that for what

3004.16 --> 3010.8799999999997
what the bible it's a dark agenda okay

3007.359 --> 3012.88
yeah i know that's gonna happen

3010.88 --> 3014.6400000000003
that's something that's on the agenda

3012.88 --> 3016.6400000000003
yeah right but the ones that are

3014.64 --> 3019.839
actually doing that agenda are

3016.64 --> 3022.5589999999997
starting to lose control

3019.839 --> 3025.04
you think so yeah and now it's up to the

3022.559 --> 3027.52
new faction to see if they will actually

3025.04 --> 3029.44
continue it if they will become

3027.52 --> 3031.2
that which they have fought and become

3029.44 --> 3033.599
the new evil

3031.2 --> 3035.9199999999996
and everyone will be seriously pissed

3033.599 --> 3037.76
off and disappointed

3035.92 --> 3038.96
beyond anything we've ever experienced

3037.76 --> 3041.92
before

3038.96 --> 3043.119
or they will actually just drop that

3041.92 --> 3047.119
[ __ ]

3043.119 --> 3050.0
and get real who knows

3047.119 --> 3050.7200000000003
it's only one way to find out and one

3050.0 --> 3052.16
way

3050.72 --> 3054.7999999999997
one thing we know for sure and that's

3052.16 --> 3057.839
that the old guard is completely

3054.8 --> 3059.2000000000003
useless there's never anything coming

3057.839 --> 3061.839
out of them that is going to be

3059.2 --> 3065.52
constructive in any manner

3061.839 --> 3068.4
ever again so i also don't

3065.52 --> 3071.28
be discarded i also don't believe in

3068.4 --> 3071.28
politics but

3073.359 --> 3076.7999999999997
it's it's up to the people

3077.44 --> 3080.559
it's really up to the people to bring

3079.28 --> 3084.2400000000002
them down

3080.559 --> 3087.599
they won't go by themselves trust me

3084.24 --> 3091.1189999999997
just another one will appear

3087.599 --> 3094.7200000000003
all right discounted

3091.119 --> 3096.96
people among us up to them as i said

3094.72 --> 3098.9599999999996
it's up to the new controllers

3096.96 --> 3100.0
will they be totally corrupted and

3098.96 --> 3102.4
decide

3100.0 --> 3105.28
yeah you know what this was nice but now

3102.4 --> 3107.839
we are going to absolutely mind control

3105.28 --> 3108.559
the entire world in our way and just

3107.839 --> 3112.0789999999997
destroy

3108.559 --> 3114.0
every opposition instantly

3112.079 --> 3115.52
then yeah then we're screwed it's up to

3114.0 --> 3118.319
them it's it's what happens

3115.52 --> 3119.92
every time something rises to that

3118.319 --> 3121.7599999999998
highest level of power

3119.92 --> 3123.44
when they no longer get up opposition

3121.76 --> 3126.96
then the moment of corruption

3123.44 --> 3128.2400000000002
comes and it is up to them to resist it

3126.96 --> 3131.839
or to

3128.24 --> 3134.8799999999997
become the evil every single time

3131.839 --> 3134.88
so what's gonna happen

3138.8 --> 3144.1600000000003
you can only uh guess on that

3144.72 --> 3151.04
what the hell very creative of you down

3148.64 --> 3151.04
threader

3151.76 --> 3154.8
but fema counts

3155.92 --> 3159.04
he says fema stands for flat earth mega

3158.4 --> 3162.4
are win

3159.04 --> 3165.359
okay yeah

3162.4 --> 3165.359
righty-dokey

3167.839 --> 3171.599
heavy conversation yeah i'm jumping all

3171.2 --> 3173.839
around

3171.599 --> 3175.04
the place i know it's hard to keep track

3173.839 --> 3178.64
but

3175.04 --> 3181.92
uh i hope we made a few good points

3178.64 --> 3185.2
on topics oh absolutely and yeah

3181.92 --> 3185.2000000000003
this these things are

3186.24 --> 3192.839
on our hearts we all do worry about this

3190.079 --> 3195.8390000000004
what's it gonna turn out and yeah it

3192.839 --> 3195.839
just

3196.559 --> 3201.44
people tend to oversimplify things over

3199.04 --> 3204.5589999999997
generalized things and

3201.44 --> 3208.48
polarize everything they look at

3204.559 --> 3210.96
that is far away so i just try to

3208.48 --> 3212.559
make it all closer and all just try to

3210.96 --> 3217.28
show it as it really is

3212.559 --> 3219.6800000000003
to the best of my abilities and

3217.28 --> 3221.3590000000004
yeah what i just put out there the

3219.68 --> 3224.64
scenario that is really

3221.359 --> 3228.0
what i think is happening

3224.64 --> 3229.359
just the two factions are obviously

3228.0 --> 3232.16
opponents

3229.359 --> 3233.7599999999998
very far and of course on the the very

3232.16 --> 3236.64
very top

3233.76 --> 3238.88
there is still that connection of

3236.64 --> 3241.04
keeping the people in the dark

3238.88 --> 3243.04
for their own protection probably is why

3241.04 --> 3246.72
they think they do it

3243.04 --> 3249.92
and for the people's own protection

3246.72 --> 3252.0
and and of course their own consistency

3249.92 --> 3256.16
the consistency of government requires

3252.0 --> 3258.96
lies not to be revealed basically and

3256.16 --> 3260.3999999999996
but yeah it's up to what the new faction

3258.96 --> 3263.44
decides when they take

3260.4 --> 3267.2000000000003
grip are they

3263.44 --> 3271.04
going to force a very specific spectrum

3267.2 --> 3271.68
of thinking on everyone and basically

3271.04 --> 3274.16
start an

3271.68 --> 3275.68
inquisition or are they just going to

3274.16 --> 3278.96
let everything calm down

3275.68 --> 3281.52
and shape naturally the libertarian way

3278.96 --> 3282.64
my god i hope that everyone hopes that a

3281.52 --> 3285.119
lot of people hope that

3282.64 --> 3286.16
except for insane social justice

3285.119 --> 3289.28
warriors

3286.16 --> 3292.96
but is that gonna happen there's

3289.28 --> 3294.799
no way to tell i don't know

3292.96 --> 3298.319
the only thing i know should we have

3294.799 --> 3301.68
eight million

3298.319 --> 3304.96
billion billion people on earth

3301.68 --> 3304.96
and climbing in number

3305.28 --> 3310.1600000000003
it's getting crowded on earth

3308.22 --> 3313.7599999999998
[Music]

3310.16 --> 3316.72
we can go up in heights but um

3313.76 --> 3317.0400000000004
the nature is suffering right well

3316.72 --> 3320.319
that's

3317.04 --> 3321.68
the problem it's yeah yeah and i i like

3320.319 --> 3324.16
to work on that

3321.68 --> 3326.3999999999996
personally i have a lot of ideas then

3324.16 --> 3329.359
i'll also want to do but

3326.4 --> 3330.799
i don't think that the amount of

3329.359 --> 3334.96
population issue

3330.799 --> 3339.04
is an issue in this it's the way

3334.96 --> 3343.28
that the controllers are managing

3339.04 --> 3343.2799999999997
things into the future where they're not

3346.839 --> 3349.839
it's

3350.88 --> 3354.4
okay what's their plan i mean if you

3352.96 --> 3356.799
look at jeff fresco

3354.4 --> 3358.079
you know the name jack fresco with venus

3356.799 --> 3361.68
project

3358.079 --> 3365.119
oh yeah yeah he's been visiting

3361.68 --> 3368.5589999999997
beatrix our queen

3365.119 --> 3370.4
what does he have to do there what's his

3368.559 --> 3374.079
business

3370.4 --> 3375.839
yeah i link everything together

3374.079 --> 3377.119
if you know the bilderberg group she

3375.839 --> 3380.48
started it yeah

3377.119 --> 3384.1600000000003
knob prince bernard kind of

3380.48 --> 3386.559
passed it on to to alexandra and and

3384.16 --> 3387.7599999999998
someone else started it from royals but

3386.559 --> 3389.52
uh it was here

3387.76 --> 3391.8390000000004
in in holland for the first time the

3389.52 --> 3391.839
meeting

3392.0 --> 3400.72
and i know for sure they're trying to

3396.72 --> 3404.8799999999997
slowly very slowly

3400.72 --> 3408.319
just just just depopulate us

3404.88 --> 3410.4
and i'm tired of it and it's it's indeed

3408.319 --> 3411.7599999999998
what you said it's the way how they

3410.4 --> 3415.04
manage it

3411.76 --> 3416.88
i mean we we've been fed lives from the

3415.04 --> 3420.24
start

3416.88 --> 3422.88
and it's like they are afraid of

3420.24 --> 3424.16
their position it's it's nice and quiet

3422.88 --> 3427.119
for them but

3424.16 --> 3427.68
even that's an incident is an illusion

3427.119 --> 3429.2000000000003
for them

3427.68 --> 3431.2
because now they're talking about god

3429.2 --> 3433.1189999999997
they're with too many

3431.2 --> 3434.72
we have to reduce the population let's

3433.119 --> 3437.28
put it on stones in six different

3434.72 --> 3437.2799999999997
languages

3437.359 --> 3442.0789999999997
what the freak yeah okay stupid

3440.48 --> 3444.319
the problem with them is and i

3442.079 --> 3447.92
completely agree is

3444.319 --> 3449.2
instead of fixing nature and making the

3447.92 --> 3451.28
garden stronger

3449.2 --> 3453.359
to account for the new population which

3451.28 --> 3456.2400000000002
can be done they decide to just

3453.359 --> 3457.119
not do that and screw it let it all be

3456.24 --> 3460.0789999999997
screwed over

3457.119 --> 3461.76
that is just the most atrocious thing

3460.079 --> 3464.88
anyone could choose from

3461.76 --> 3467.2000000000003
any perspective it is nothing but evil

3464.88 --> 3469.599
and instead they prioritize just getting

3467.2 --> 3471.52
rid of humans to battle that

3469.599 --> 3473.76
that system but it's not gonna work

3471.52 --> 3476.48
because nature will keep declining and

3473.76 --> 3478.2400000000002
it will eventually if they continue that

3476.48 --> 3480.64
force them to put it down to

3478.24 --> 3482.799
zero humans and that's the insanity of

3480.64 --> 3486.319
it

3482.799 --> 3490.079
it's insane instead of just fixed nature

3486.319 --> 3493.68
and yeah and then nature will

3490.079 --> 3498.799
fix mankind and it will be

3493.68 --> 3501.359
a new world in balance it can be done

3498.799 --> 3503.599
especially with the technology now my

3501.359 --> 3505.5989999999997
god the possibilities and we don't need

3503.599 --> 3507.2000000000003
freaking space travel [ __ ] we don't

3505.599 --> 3511.28
need another fresh planet

3507.2 --> 3514.5589999999997
we can just make our planet a paradise

3511.28 --> 3517.76
right now in a scale

3514.559 --> 3520.6400000000003
that makes the gardens of babylon

3517.76 --> 3521.28
however we imagine them to be look like

3520.64 --> 3525.359
a

3521.28 --> 3528.6400000000003
freaking [ __ ] guy's backyard

3525.359 --> 3531.5989999999997
okay we could have giant taipei

stuff myself as well so many people just

3656.319 --> 3658.799
leave

3656.88 --> 3661.28
garbage everywhere and i can't stand to

3658.799 --> 3661.28
look at it

3661.68 --> 3668.319
just when i was a kid

3664.72 --> 3671.68
if i'd like throw junk somewhere

3668.319 --> 3675.2799999999997
my parents would punish me not harshly

3671.68 --> 3677.2799999999997
but enough to make me take it seriously

3675.28 --> 3679.52
and ever since i just cleaned up why

3677.28 --> 3683.119
don't parents do this

3679.52 --> 3685.839

this has to stop it's so useless

3690.96 --> 3697.68
it's it's no need to let that kind of

3694.799 --> 3700.799
behavior be a part of this world

3697.68 --> 3704.0
there's no need for it it's only

3700.799 --> 3707.68
useless stop it

3704.0 --> 3708.559

somebody doing that

3728.319 --> 3731.68
if i spot somebody doing that face to

3730.4 --> 3733.92
face just throwing

3731.68 --> 3735.5989999999997

3767.359 --> 3771.0389999999998
thinks he's funny being a troll oh

3769.52 --> 3772.64
i want to say something about that

3771.039 --> 3774.96
because here in arnhem

3772.64 --> 3777.359
they're indeed cutting down all the

3774.96 --> 3777.359
trees

3778.64 --> 3782.0789999999997
what yeah here in ireland all the trees

3781.599 --> 3785.6800000000003
are

3782.079 --> 3786.4
vanishing and i i made fake uh pictures

3785.68 --> 3789.5989999999997
of it

3786.4 --> 3792.799
and it's not gonna be

3789.599 --> 3797.039
long before they gonna cut down uh

3792.799 --> 3800.72
the complete force why why

3797.039 --> 3805.92
they need space to build

3800.72 --> 3805.9199999999996
houses what yeah

3806.799 --> 3813.68
and it makes a lot of money cutting down

3810.48 --> 3813.68
the trees they make wood

3816.0 --> 3822.799
great yeah

3819.68 --> 3827.1189999999997
yay the netherlands

3822.799 --> 3832.16
giant shitty city goody

3827.119 --> 3832.1600000000003
we got a moroccan guy as uh um

3832.319 --> 3842.72
burgermeister yeah

3838.4 --> 3842.7200000000003
i'm not trying to be racist but um

3844.24 --> 3850.0
yeah he's a liberal i don't know

3848.24 --> 3853.839
everyone's a freaking liberal in the

3850.0 --> 3857.2
netherlands disgusting weenies

3853.839 --> 3860.4
idiots corporatist anti-human

3857.2 --> 3863.1189999999997
parasite panderers

3860.4 --> 3865.839
i hate the politicians here all of them

3863.119 --> 3865.839
disgusting

3869.52 --> 3873.7599999999998
the last one was a good one it was

3871.44 --> 3878.48
female and she closed down

3873.76 --> 3881.3590000000004
all the the prostitutes uh buildings

3878.48 --> 3882.2400000000002
so we don't have that lot of uh crime

3881.359 --> 3886.5589999999997
around

3882.24 --> 3890.0789999999997
that area anymore what sorry

3886.559 --> 3894.3190000000004
uh the last person i was in charge

3890.079 --> 3894.799
of arnhem she closed down the prostitute

3894.319 --> 3898.319
zone

3894.799 --> 3900.48
all right okay and uh that was a really

3898.319 --> 3903.2
good decision because the crime rates

3900.48 --> 3903.2
really went down

3904.4 --> 3911.599
okay no that

3909.599 --> 3912.96
if you say so i don't know how that

3911.599 --> 3916.079
works you know

3912.96 --> 3918.079
i i don't think that crime rate even has

3916.079 --> 3920.559
a direct relations with these things

3918.079 --> 3923.76
it's just that the market will be open

3920.559 --> 3927.8390000000004
to crime because crime is rampant

3923.76 --> 3930.48
and nobody's doing anything about it

3927.839 --> 3931.68
the politicians are just letting that

3930.48 --> 3935.359
all be

3931.68 --> 3937.5989999999997
roughly what it is i think there's still

3935.359 --> 3940.5589999999997
something being done about crime but

3937.599 --> 3943.039
just very little and it's rampant it's

3940.559 --> 3944.4
chronic it's part of the freaking

3943.039 --> 3946.559
culture

3944.4 --> 3948.079
it's made part of the culture if you

3946.559 --> 3950.559
remove one crime lord

3948.079 --> 3951.76
immediately a new one pops up from the

3950.559 --> 3953.6800000000003
grassroots

3951.76 --> 3955.8390000000004
that they helped corrupt it with their

3953.68 --> 3961.1189999999997
shitty corporate system and their

3955.839 --> 3961.119
insanity propaganda it's all about money

3962.72 --> 3967.9199999999996
but all right

3968.319 --> 3972.48
ah you're depressing me dude i'm sorry

3971.68 --> 3975.2799999999997
man

3972.48 --> 3975.76
it's just what i uh keep in mind you

3975.28 --> 3979.8390000000004
know

3975.76 --> 3979.8390000000004
that i don't forget about it

3981.599 --> 3984.96
all right well i don't know yet it's

3984.64 --> 3986.8799999999997
just

3984.96 --> 3988.4
and that's also for the other listener

3986.88 --> 3991.92
listening

3988.4 --> 3994.1600000000003
so yeah sorry

3991.92 --> 3995.92
it's just that every time somebody

3994.16 --> 3998.96
actually tells me about something

3995.92 --> 4001.039
like freaking force being removed for a

3998.96 --> 4004.16
bunch of new shitty buildings i

4001.039 --> 4006.48
gets insidious i'm sorry

4004.16 --> 4007.7599999999998
there's nothing more i hate about

4006.48 --> 4011.039
humanity than that

4007.76 --> 4014.0
it's like the only thing

4011.039 --> 4014.88
that makes me go for a moment to the

4014.0 --> 4017.68
other side and think

4014.88 --> 4018.6400000000003
yeah maybe they all do deserve to die if

4017.68 --> 4022.72
we all let that

4018.64 --> 4025.1189999999997
[ __ ] happen for no good reason

4022.72 --> 4025.7599999999998
you know what stupid is it's even an

4025.119 --> 4028.96
illegal

4025.76 --> 4032.8390000000004
planetary sorry

4028.96 --> 4036.2400000000002
it's even illegal to plant a tree

4032.839 --> 4039.2799999999997
what yeah it's it's the truth

4036.24 --> 4039.9199999999996
if you want to plant a tree here next to

4039.28 --> 4043.3590000000004
the

4039.92 --> 4044.2400000000002
train uh uh tracks no yeah but that

4043.359 --> 4049.839
makes sense

4044.24 --> 4049.839
come on yeah well okay but if you see

4049.92 --> 4053.44
no but come on you can't do it you can't

4052.24 --> 4055.0389999999998
grow a tree

4053.44 --> 4058.079
next to a train track because it's going

4055.039 --> 4062.7990000000004
to stabilize the train tracks

4058.079 --> 4067.2000000000003
i i mean not really next to it but

4062.799 --> 4071.119
uh let's say it's 50 meters yeah

4067.2 --> 4071.1189999999997
well roots can go very far

4072.079 --> 4076.48
okay it's kind of white but okay then

4074.72 --> 4077.5989999999997
they should cut down all the trees over

4076.48 --> 4081.44
here

4077.599 --> 4084.48
no why because i wanted to plant another

4081.44 --> 4087.92
tree next to the other trees

4084.48 --> 4090.319
okay well i'm all for planting trees but

4087.92 --> 4091.2000000000003
i mean too but it's illegal if they see

4090.319 --> 4094.24
it if you see

4091.2 --> 4095.2799999999997
if they see if you plant uh already a

4094.24 --> 4098.48
small tree

4095.28 --> 4099.279
uh somewhere there and and someone of

4098.48 --> 4102.5599999999995
the environment

4099.279 --> 4104.96
the government or whatever okay so

4102.56 --> 4106.0
what is this environment thing uh who

4104.96 --> 4109.12
made it like that

4106.0 --> 4109.359
and how can you get rid of it yeah how

4109.12 --> 4111.44
are

4109.359 --> 4112.4800000000005
not rid of it but replace it with people

4111.44 --> 4116.239
that are not

4112.48 --> 4118.959999999999
insane no no no no man

4116.239 --> 4120.879999999999
because this sounds very fda like

4118.96 --> 4125.44
reverse reality corruption

4120.88 --> 4128.08
in place so that must be taken down

4125.44 --> 4128.719
seriously what if i start talking about

4128.08 --> 4132.0
uh

4128.719 --> 4135.44
disturbing distributing uh human

4132.0 --> 4138.239

4152.64 --> 4158.2390000000005
look you don't need to destroy freaking

4156.0 --> 4158.799
forests for buildings you can just take

4158.239 --> 4161.5199999999995
the old

4158.799 --> 4164.08
shitty buildings demolish them and build

4214.719 --> 4218.96
the realization that

4216.0 --> 4220.96
the world is [ __ ] we're not doing

4218.96 --> 4224.32

4500.88 --> 4504.96
when it comes down to it we're told

4502.56 --> 4505.52
cowards and two-faced maniacs that just

4504.96 --> 4506.96
destroy

4505.52 --> 4509.679
everything and don't think about it

4506.96 --> 4513.02

4539.36 --> 4543.12
part off but yeah this is what i feel

4541.76 --> 4546.400000000001
i'm sick of it

4543.12 --> 4551.92
you know i love real humanity

4546.4 --> 4554.639999999999
when it's actually a real human hey dude

4551.92 --> 4556.64
when it's real

4554.64 --> 4558.400000000001
when it's all lies it's all two-faced

4556.64 --> 4560.4800000000005
and you pretend to be the good guy you

4558.4 --> 4562.639999999999
pretend to be a protector but instead

4560.48 --> 4566.799999999999
you do exactly the opposite then you

4562.64 --> 4570.159000000001
need to exit this world forever

4566.8 --> 4573.360000000001
go to the abyss and don't come

4570.159 --> 4575.679
back please

4573.36 --> 4577.28
please make room we can make something

4575.679 --> 4580.96
of this world with humans

4577.28 --> 4584.4
and nature and it can all be glorious

4580.96 --> 4587.76
can be a giant science fiction

4584.4 --> 4591.44
like paradise with untold

4587.76 --> 4594.4800000000005
wonders like in

4591.44 --> 4596.799999999999
in the virtual and

4594.48 --> 4599.28
in the real simultaneously and you can

4596.8 --> 4602.4800000000005
seek adventure wherever you like

4599.28 --> 4605.759999999999
you know can be there if you want to

4602.48 --> 4608.959999999999
imagine being a total freak in some

4605.76 --> 4610.2390000000005
crazy party or some demon slashing fest

4608.96 --> 4612.159
you gotta do that

4610.239 --> 4615.199
but don't do it in the real world so

4612.159 --> 4618.639999999999
that things get actually destroyed

4615.199 --> 4621.759999999999
whatever do it all but don't

4618.64 --> 4623.679
be a two-faced bastard that says he

4621.76 --> 4626.400000000001
protects everything and then

4623.679 --> 4629.12
does exactly the opposite in the process

4626.4 --> 4629.12
hello kitty

4629.44 --> 4633.839999999999
i think you have to be spiritual also

4634.159 --> 4640.159
clear on what's good and what's not good

4640.239 --> 4645.919999999999
i mean if you want to be a bastard to

4643.04 --> 4648.48
the outside world

4645.92 --> 4650.0
okay that's your choice but if you want

4648.48 --> 4652.0
to be a good guy to the other

4650.0 --> 4653.36
world you also have to be a good side a

4652.0 --> 4657.36
good guy on the inside

4653.36 --> 4661.28
and if you know that's right and horns

4657.36 --> 4661.28
and you know it's

4662.48 --> 4665.839999999999
never mind yeah but uh look that whole

4665.28 --> 4669.599999999999
horn

4665.84 --> 4671.6
thing and the metal all that look i've

4669.6 --> 4672.56
been there okay literally i come from

4671.6 --> 4675.6
there

4672.56 --> 4675.6
but the problem is

4676.08 --> 4681.679
even the bolts no it's more complex than

4679.6 --> 4685.6
that it is co-opted

4681.679 --> 4688.96
look when they do this metal

4685.6 --> 4692.400000000001
the devil horns it is both a symbol

4688.96 --> 4694.719
of rebellion like satan to gothics is a

4692.4 --> 4696.32
symbol of rebellion against statism

4694.719 --> 4699.76
basically that's how they do it

4696.32 --> 4702.5599999999995
and it is also the inner thing

4699.76 --> 4703.52
but they don't understand that at the

4702.56 --> 4706.320000000001
same time as

4703.52 --> 4706.88
that progresses onward it actually does

4706.32 --> 4710.88
become

4706.88 --> 4713.6
very seriously real for many people

4710.88 --> 4713.92
that are actually in control and that is

4713.6 --> 4716.4800000000005
the

4713.92 --> 4720.56
the sick thing about it that's also what

4716.48 --> 4723.839999999999
hit me in the face really hard

4720.56 --> 4725.360000000001
because i i yeah i was gothic you know i

4723.84 --> 4726.64
did go to metal parties and then i

4725.36 --> 4728.4
figured out like

4726.64 --> 4730.64
you know what there are people out here

4728.4 --> 4732.5599999999995
that take this actually literally and

4730.64 --> 4735.76
they repulse me

4732.56 --> 4737.76
i don't doubt literally hurts being

4735.76 --> 4741.6
physically in their presence i can

4737.76 --> 4744.8
feel like a cold burn in their presence

4741.6 --> 4745.360000000001
just disgusting why do these people

4744.8 --> 4749.84
exist

4745.36 --> 4749.839999999999
i don't get it i just don't get it

4751.04 --> 4755.92
yeah they've been babies too you know

4753.6 --> 4761.52
everybody has a different background

4755.92 --> 4761.52
story what's left of them

4765.12 --> 4769.84
like uh those persons have given up

4767.52 --> 4769.84
already

4771.44 --> 4776.639999999999
well were they ever there to give up

4774.32 --> 4776.639999999999
even

4777.679 --> 4781.1990000000005
i don't know how much they realize that

4780.0 --> 4784.159
they are

4781.199 --> 4784.159
here in the now

4786.8 --> 4792.88
hold on uh

4790.159 --> 4792.879999999999
what's the name

4794.159 --> 4800.239
what what's the name of the cat

4797.6 --> 4802.08
uh he doesn't have a name he's not

4800.239 --> 4803.28
really my cat i don't know what his name

4802.08 --> 4807.04
is

4803.28 --> 4807.04
oh i just call him kitty

4807.92 --> 4817.36
kitty that's a good name

4812.8 --> 4821.12
that's a good name kitty yeah

4817.36 --> 4821.92
i guess i don't know he's not really my

4821.12 --> 4824.88
cat so i

4821.92 --> 4826.2390000000005
i dare not give him a literal name so i

4824.88 --> 4828.4800000000005
don't know if he

4826.239 --> 4830.239
is a wild cat or if it's somebody else's

4828.48 --> 4831.36
cat that just wanders around a lot i

4830.239 --> 4833.919999999999
don't know

4831.36 --> 4835.28
but okay he just walks in and out and

4833.92 --> 4837.1990000000005
yeah i do have to open

4835.28 --> 4841.04
i'm gonna let him out of the building

4837.199 --> 4841.04
because he can't open the doors himself

4845.12 --> 4852.32
house bats are good companions house

4848.639 --> 4854.4800000000005
house bats are good companions yes

4852.32 --> 4855.84
i got two birds myself they probably

4854.48 --> 4859.36
heard them

4855.84 --> 4862.639
no and no you didn't oh thank god

4859.36 --> 4862.639

4869.04 --> 4875.84
vodka yeah okay

4872.8 --> 4875.84

4876.719 --> 4882.4800000000005

4880.159 --> 4882.48
june

4884.239 --> 4889.44
right so dude it's

4887.52 --> 4892.2390000000005
interesting it's been a pleasure it's

4889.44 --> 4895.759999999999
been exhilarating and it's been quite

4892.239 --> 4898.638999999999
maddening as well yeah

4895.76 --> 4900.159000000001
but not to your fault it's just i deal

4898.639 --> 4902.88
with this [ __ ] a lot and i

4900.159 --> 4903.839999999999
get pissed off really badly and rarely

4902.88 --> 4907.12
do i express

4903.84 --> 4908.0
that out in the open that doesn't make

4907.12 --> 4911.199
you that person

4908.0 --> 4913.28
but i'm not the only one i know like you

4911.199 --> 4914.839999999999
you've you've seen alex jones you know

4913.28 --> 4919.44
that he has this [ __ ] too

4914.84 --> 4921.4400000000005
and it's the same type of effect really

4919.44 --> 4923.12
i'm just so sick of it and literally

4921.44 --> 4925.919999999999
start foaming at the mouth once it's

4923.12 --> 4925.92
released just like

4929.04 --> 4935.5199999999995
but yeah my message was clear my target

4933.36 --> 4937.44
was clear it's only the ones that think

4935.52 --> 4938.159000000001
that it is good to destroy everything or

4937.44 --> 4940.96
that

4938.159 --> 4942.4
do it whether they think it is or not

4940.96 --> 4944.32
it's not to anyone else

4942.4 --> 4946.08
look anyone can make a mistake anyone

4944.32 --> 4948.48
can turn out to be

4946.08 --> 4949.6
waking up and figure out oh [ __ ] i'm on

4948.48 --> 4952.159
the wrong side

4949.6 --> 4954.159000000001
you're not my target everyone has a

4952.159 --> 4957.839999999999
chance to walk away but if you

4954.159 --> 4961.44
walk straight into that darkness

4957.84 --> 4962.400000000001
get out of the way yeah i don't nobody

4961.44 --> 4965.678999999999
wants you

4962.4 --> 4966.5599999999995
you don't want you to go away and leave

4965.679 --> 4969.12
this world

4966.56 --> 4969.120000000001
forever

4970.159 --> 4974.239

5021.84 --> 5028.159000000001
