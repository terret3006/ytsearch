absolutely gorgeous it's even better

91.119 --> 96.4
than yesterday

92.88 --> 98.15899999999999
there's literally not a cloud in sight

96.4 --> 101.84
anywhere

98.159 --> 101.84
it's bright blue

102.24 --> 107.03999999999999
maybe slightly hazy more towards the sun

110.56 --> 115.52
but yeah no trails

112.88 --> 118.79899999999999
still i see planes flying up there

115.52 --> 121.52
they're not leaving anything lasting

118.799 --> 124.56
it's a really beautiful sunny day a bit

121.52 --> 126.88
of wind but it's overall just very warm

124.56 --> 129.119
and super sunny

126.88 --> 132.07999999999998
a delightful

129.119 --> 132.08
late summer's day

141.599 --> 146.23899999999998
right

143.04 --> 149.28
hello gadget inspector first in chat

146.239 --> 150.4
dusty ryder good to see you again

149.28 --> 151.84
all right

150.4 --> 154.16
yeah before

151.84 --> 154.16
this

154.56 --> 160.239
mitchell from australia had a unlisted

157.76 --> 162.72
live hangout with

160.239 --> 167.28
anthony riley sleeping warrior about

162.72 --> 170.319
relative density and it was really good

167.28 --> 173.2
and he's gonna premiere that later on

170.319 --> 174.72
after editing it slightly if i get it

173.2 --> 176.39999999999998
correctly

174.72 --> 178.319
there was some connection issues on

176.4 --> 179.68
tony's side sometimes

178.319 --> 182.23899999999998
but it was

179.68 --> 185.84
really good and focused and i was just

182.239 --> 189.44
going nuts in chat well nuts i was

185.84 --> 189.44
basically doing my part

190.0 --> 196.08
laying out the structures

192.56 --> 197.36
and yeah they were also picked up upon

196.08 --> 200.31900000000002
by mitchell

197.36 --> 203.04000000000002
and it was just really good it was like

200.319 --> 205.92
a highly up-to-date

203.04 --> 208.959
relative density mechanics hangout and

205.92 --> 210.83999999999997
it was just great very very much worth

208.959 --> 213.84
watching if you're

210.84 --> 217.04
interested in relative density

213.84 --> 217.04
versus gravity

220.319 --> 227.83999999999997
hello michael rourke

223.44 --> 227.84
pj krishan good to see you

228.879 --> 232.239
let's see what the temperature is

233.84 --> 236.0
it is

234.879 --> 238.879
saturday

236.0 --> 241.84
the 4th of september 2021

238.879 --> 241.84
by the way

245.76 --> 252.239
it's 20 degrees celsius here

249.36 --> 255.84
63 percent humidity so that would

252.239 --> 255.84
explain the slight haze

257.519 --> 261.199
but there's no clouds just none

263.6 --> 267.36
all right might even get warmer later in

265.759 --> 269.44
the evening

267.36 --> 271.04
that's just great

269.44 --> 273.6
looking forward to

271.04 --> 273.6
this day

276.0 --> 283.44
right so yeah great show very inspiring

280.08 --> 285.919
man i was very active yesterday as well

283.44 --> 287.12
but it got a little uh bumpy later in

285.919 --> 290.32
the evening

287.12 --> 292.639
a gadget inspector was there

290.32 --> 294.96
over at brandon's

292.639 --> 297.84000000000003
there was a certain sock account and i

294.96 --> 300.96
just i got really

297.84 --> 303.19899999999996
really aggressive on that

300.96 --> 305.919
but yeah thankfully

303.199 --> 308.16
people were kind of taking me serious

305.919 --> 312.479
even though i i really just

308.16 --> 314.40000000000003
like rolled in attacking everybody

312.479 --> 316.88
but yeah that's also because there was

314.4 --> 318.88
probably an unexpected slight

316.88 --> 321.68
heightening of my testosterone

318.88 --> 321.68
temporarily

322.72 --> 325.72
uh

329.199 --> 333.08
so i'm gonna blame that

340.32 --> 345.759
that was terrible

341.84 --> 348.79999999999995
well i was just really pissed off

345.759 --> 352.039
was it terrible it was clumsy on my part

348.8 --> 352.039
i agree

359.36 --> 366.36
but hey as soon as it was addressed

362.08 --> 366.35999999999996
i went back to normal so

367.36 --> 371.6
yeah gadget inspector but you you have

369.36 --> 372.47900000000004
to understand also that like the entire

371.6 --> 375.44
day

372.479 --> 377.44
yesterday show i really seriously

375.44 --> 381.6
triggered a bunch of people including

377.44 --> 383.84
ones that were already kind of like

381.6 --> 385.28000000000003
nagging me in the background for for

383.84 --> 387.19899999999996
years

385.28 --> 389.44
it's ups and downs and they all came

387.199 --> 389.44
back

392.4 --> 397.19899999999996
because i really got to him

394.4 --> 399.75899999999996
with what i said on my show yesterday i

397.199 --> 399.759
really did

405.759 --> 411.91900000000004
cats no it wasn't conspiracy cats

408.72 --> 414.639
no he doesn't do that

411.919 --> 415.599
conspiracy cats trolls with his own

414.639 --> 420.84000000000003
socks

415.599 --> 420.84
that he clearly identifies as himself

422.08 --> 427.44
so it wasn't cats

425.039 --> 427.44
anyway

433.199 --> 438.319
yes i did well gadget inspector did you

435.28 --> 440.08
watch my show from yesterday

438.319 --> 443.03900000000004
i pretty much

440.08 --> 444.24
grill down hard with

443.039 --> 447.84
basically

444.24 --> 450.639
with god's wrath on top of that

447.84 --> 451.75899999999996
getting all extra dimensional perceptive

450.639 --> 453.44
and [ __ ]

451.759 --> 456.47900000000004
i i grilled him

453.44 --> 458.96
mentally tortured him for an hour

456.479 --> 460.8
as he was trying to be just like the

458.96 --> 464.31899999999996
ultimate

460.8 --> 468.40000000000003
anti-flat earther gamma bastard in my

464.319 --> 470.08000000000004
chat for an hour like let him do that

468.4 --> 471.919
just

470.08 --> 474.56
to zone in

471.919 --> 476.56
and psychoanalyze him and his

474.56 --> 478.639
experiences and that's something that

476.56 --> 481.52
they never expect

478.639 --> 483.599
they never expect that to actually work

481.52 --> 486.87899999999996
from our side

483.599 --> 489.919
i'm very good at making that work

486.879 --> 489.91900000000004
when i feel like it

491.28 --> 493.84
anyway

498.56 --> 503.039
it was someone who knows you come on

500.319 --> 506.639
this show because he dressed yeah

503.039 --> 508.479
you think that the guys making the

506.639 --> 510.479
arwyn socks

508.479 --> 512.399
with like all kinds of pictures that

510.479 --> 515.5989999999999
they've ripped from my show that they

512.399 --> 517.44
don't know who hangs around this show

515.599 --> 518.719
pj kruschenk

517.44 --> 520.8800000000001
these people

518.719 --> 522.24
that never show themselves that never

520.88 --> 526.24
have had their

522.24 --> 527.519
voices heard identified

526.24 --> 529.839
on the internet

527.519 --> 532.32
they're totally obsessed

529.839 --> 535.36
with what i do

532.32 --> 537.279
they're like trying to profile me

535.36 --> 538.72
because i think that they really feel

537.279 --> 541.2
i'm a threat

538.72 --> 544.32
and yeah they might be on to something i

541.2 --> 546.399
am really a threat

544.32 --> 548.399
to anybody

546.399 --> 551.839
in this world that

548.399 --> 554.88
persists unrelentingly to double down on

551.839 --> 559.36
lies towards the world and themselves

554.88 --> 561.8389999999999
it's my personal spiritual inquisition

559.36 --> 564.0
so yeah

561.839 --> 567.2790000000001
they can profile me all day they can

564.0 --> 570.32
create this entire

567.279 --> 572.16
bizarre as i've earlier explained in a

570.32 --> 573.9200000000001
previous show a week ago

572.16 --> 579.1999999999999
a pantheon

573.92 --> 579.1999999999999
of inside out caricatures

579.519 --> 586.0
right related to

582.0 --> 586.0
the person they do that [ __ ]

586.08 --> 590.399
it's an obsession so they know everybody

588.64 --> 592.56
that hangs around here they they

590.399 --> 595.12
freaking pay attention because they're

592.56 --> 595.1199999999999
obsessed

596.959 --> 601.76
so

598.959 --> 604.8
just because you are able to recognize

601.76 --> 606.16
individuals to a certain degree

604.8 --> 608.399
doesn't mean

606.16 --> 612.24
that there aren't individuals that are

608.399 --> 613.519
absolutely sizing everybody up

612.24 --> 618.16
making note

613.519 --> 620.9590000000001
without even showing they're there

618.16 --> 623.68
all right anyway hello aries curse man

620.959 --> 626.6899999999999
return to normal the pat

623.68 --> 629.8389999999999
the new pad files

626.69 --> 629.839
[Music]

635.6 --> 641.279
yes inspector gadget i know

638.88 --> 644.079
now and i i was so in i was so

641.279 --> 644.079
infuriated

644.48 --> 646.8000000000001
that

645.76 --> 648.959
i

646.8 --> 653.12
almost started to just think that

648.959 --> 656.3199999999999
brandon was kind of letting it slide

653.12 --> 658.72
like for example ranty would on purpose

656.32 --> 661.36
let that slide or jose would let that

658.72 --> 664.0790000000001
slide because they actually think it's

661.36 --> 666.5600000000001
funny when i'm being trolled and all

664.079 --> 670.079
heard over it they do

666.56 --> 673.1999999999999
ranty jose they they like that

670.079 --> 675.8389999999999
right and i accidentally thought

673.2 --> 679.12
that brandon was like that too it's only

675.839 --> 679.12
later that he really

679.2 --> 683.279
did catch on

681.279 --> 685.12
so i was mistaken

683.279 --> 686.64
at first glance because i was just

685.12 --> 688.72
really pissed off and i got a little

686.64 --> 689.92
paranoid because of it

688.72 --> 694.399
see

689.92 --> 694.399
i'm not impervious i'm not perfect

696.8 --> 702.12
i'm still a human being with weak

699.12 --> 702.12
moments

709.04 --> 714.8
my real name is rover

711.839 --> 716.399
what the [ __ ]

714.8 --> 718.639
where the hell did they come up with

716.399 --> 718.639
that

725.279 --> 729.8
i mean that's not even a dutch name

731.04 --> 735.24
that's a bunch of weirdos

762.24 --> 767.44
yes aries cursor man yes it's not the

764.8 --> 767.4399999999999
first time

768.72 --> 775.44
i've shared a lot of like personal

772.0 --> 777.6
feeling sensitive things

775.44 --> 781.7600000000001
about myself on this show and every

777.6 --> 786.0
single time they immediately

781.76 --> 788.24
jump on that and start to create

786.0 --> 790.88
mockery things with it it's been

788.24 --> 793.04
happening for years

790.88 --> 796.16
it's been happening even before the flat

793.04 --> 796.16
earth early bird show

797.44 --> 801.44
now at first i wasn't the only one like

799.519 --> 804.48
they did that same sort of [ __ ] like

801.44 --> 807.12
with patricia steer for example and

804.48 --> 809.9200000000001
and nathan they they like to do it too

807.12 --> 811.839
but they really held on with me like it

809.92 --> 812.8389999999999
still happens

811.839 --> 816.48
but that's

812.839 --> 819.44
because i basically refuse to

816.48 --> 819.44
desensitize

823.199 --> 826.24
i just don't do that

826.639 --> 830.32
i mean i will grow skin

829.36 --> 832.16
but

830.32 --> 837.0400000000001
there's still that sensitive element

832.16 --> 839.76
it's it's a core component of my spirit

837.04 --> 839.76
i need it

839.92 --> 846.639
but it does come with

842.56 --> 848.88
pitfall situations in weak moments

846.639 --> 851.199
that's just the price

848.88 --> 852.0
i have to pay and i'm willing to pay for

851.199 --> 856.76
that

852.0 --> 856.76
but it's still pretty grueling at times

881.04 --> 885.8389999999999
hey james mason

882.959 --> 885.8389999999999
good to see you

890.0 --> 895.92
yeah good yes yeah but

893.279 --> 898.0
it's one guy

895.92 --> 901.279
and if he really feels like it he'll

898.0 --> 903.519
have like 50 sock accounts right he

901.279 --> 906.399
he puts a lot of work

903.519 --> 906.399
into doing it

907.36 --> 910.639
he's kind of insane like

910.839 --> 914.24
that all right

917.68 --> 921.279
hey

918.56 --> 922.7199999999999
captain caveman

921.279 --> 926.279
right but yeah

922.72 --> 926.279
it's kind of a

926.959 --> 932.6389999999999
stupid subject i think

929.199 --> 934.639
it just happened yesterday and

932.639 --> 937.92
it really i really blame just a

934.639 --> 940.0
testosterone boost because

937.92 --> 942.8
well i've been just kind of like hanging

940.0 --> 942.8
around a little

944.72 --> 947.839
talking

946.48 --> 950.88
with the uh

947.839 --> 954.24
the very cute roommate

950.88 --> 956.48
and yeah that was kind of invigorating i

954.24 --> 958.0790000000001
think she might think i'm actually kind

956.48 --> 961.279
of cute

958.079 --> 961.279
but i i'm just

961.6 --> 968.519
i'm not gonna just like

963.6 --> 968.519
break open a can of you know what

969.04 --> 974.24
so i i don't want to

971.68 --> 977.279
i still have to size a lot up right but

974.24 --> 980.0
i i know that she's just attractive and

977.279 --> 983.36
she is like

980.0 --> 985.519
she has a lot of energy and confidence

983.36 --> 986.9590000000001
but that even makes me want to be even

985.519 --> 988.48
more careful

986.959 --> 990.16
right

988.48 --> 991.6800000000001
because i have a lot of knowledge of

990.16 --> 993.92
things that

991.68 --> 995.5999999999999
tend to encourage

993.92 --> 997.199
on that state

995.6 --> 1000.48
if you know what i mean

997.199 --> 1002.8
but i don't know yet what she is like on

1000.48 --> 1004.88
the inside she might just be actually

1002.8 --> 1007.88
kind of hungry for that [ __ ] maybe she

1004.88 --> 1007.88
is

1010.0 --> 1015.12
much stronger

1012.8 --> 1016.56
i don't know yet

1015.12 --> 1020.399
she

1016.56 --> 1022.079
composes herself pretty confident

1020.399 --> 1025.72
but she's still kind of young anyway

1022.079 --> 1025.72
enough about that

1032.64 --> 1037.8390000000002
oh hey john levin yeah yeah it is you

1035.52 --> 1041.8799999999999
that's right

1037.839 --> 1041.8799999999999
stick a fork in it

1052.24 --> 1054.559
ah

1055.84 --> 1060.48
seeked our visa i don't seek

1058.72 --> 1062.559
v status

1060.48 --> 1064.96
i will ask her

1062.559 --> 1067.12
eventually

1064.96 --> 1070.0
but i would prefer

1067.12 --> 1074.6399999999999
it to naturally from her side come up as

1070.0 --> 1074.64
a subject right and she's been very

1075.44 --> 1082.96
outreaching in ways it's just

1079.28 --> 1082.96
so it might just come up

1085.28 --> 1089.36
but yeah she also at the same time in

1087.12 --> 1092.2399999999998
the middle of a medical study

1089.36 --> 1095.6
i don't want to like

1092.24 --> 1098.6
disrupt her flow right taking it very

1095.6 --> 1098.6
serious

1119.84 --> 1124.1599999999999
right

1121.039 --> 1126.24
yeah it is true

1124.16 --> 1129.919
telling

1126.24 --> 1132.799
a demon to commit a sin is kind of

1129.919 --> 1134.88
superfluous it is

1132.799 --> 1139.2
self-defeating

1134.88 --> 1139.2
because the demon is there because right

1139.6 --> 1143.6
but yeah

1141.12 --> 1145.9189999999999
i think that

1143.6 --> 1148.24
christians in general when they arrive

1145.919 --> 1152.24
at such situations they either just try

1148.24 --> 1153.36
to avoid it or

1152.24 --> 1155.919
they

1153.36 --> 1160.1599999999999
say something that is effectively going

1155.919 --> 1160.16
to lead to the same thing but they use

1160.799 --> 1163.679
metaphors

1162.32 --> 1165.6
rather right

1163.679 --> 1168.72
and i do that too

1165.6 --> 1170.8799999999999
but sometimes i just don't give a [ __ ] i

1168.72 --> 1170.88
i

1171.679 --> 1177.96
yeah

1173.919 --> 1177.96
sometimes i'm a little weak

1179.28 --> 1185.799
but yeah i'm definitely not taking that

1181.28 --> 1185.799
back you are a monster

1193.44 --> 1198.559
right yet the spirit that occupies you

1196.88 --> 1201.0390000000002
and that drives your thoughts and

1198.559 --> 1205.1589999999999
feelings whatever is left of them yeah

1201.039 --> 1205.1589999999999
that's not human that's right

1209.2 --> 1214.48
you're a demon possessing a vessel

1212.88 --> 1217.2
and you think

1214.48 --> 1220.159
you're it you the demon thinks he is the

1217.2 --> 1224.0
individual

1220.159 --> 1224.0
right because you want to take over

1224.08 --> 1228.08
the real person in there

1226.24 --> 1230.32
you don't even remember what that was

1228.08 --> 1230.32
like

1232.159 --> 1237.7600000000002
because that's what happens when you

1233.76 --> 1240.72
slip into nasty nasty

1237.76 --> 1243.039
unrelenting nastiness

1240.72 --> 1245.52
at a constant level right it

1243.039 --> 1248.72
desensitizes you it makes you forget who

1245.52 --> 1252.799
you really are and that's how eventually

1248.72 --> 1252.799
the other spirit takes you over

1253.28 --> 1256.08
that's you now

1256.559 --> 1259.6789999999999
has nothing to do with who you really

1258.88 --> 1261.44
are

1259.679 --> 1265.1200000000001
why you're really here

1261.44 --> 1266.799
no you lost all that

1265.12 --> 1271.039
you let it slip

1266.799 --> 1271.76
and you gave your internal control over

1271.039 --> 1274.0
to

1271.76 --> 1275.84
nasty elements

1274.0 --> 1278.32
bad frequencies

1275.84 --> 1280.799
that are universally identified as

1278.32 --> 1280.799
demons

1281.44 --> 1285.0
so that's right

1292.64 --> 1296.64
i'm not

1293.679 --> 1299.52
dehumanizing you your vessel

1296.64 --> 1301.919
is probably still human right depends on

1299.52 --> 1303.76
how many gene altering vaccines you've

1301.919 --> 1305.44
taken

1303.76 --> 1307.76
right

1305.44 --> 1309.919
but that spirit

1307.76 --> 1311.76
that is acting right now that's not

1309.919 --> 1313.8400000000001
human

1311.76 --> 1315.6
you're demonic

1313.84 --> 1317.84
right

1315.6 --> 1319.84
and i don't think anybody in the world

1317.84 --> 1322.32
would mind people

1319.84 --> 1324.9599999999998
that act like you do and have the

1322.32 --> 1327.039
occupations that you do

1324.96 --> 1329.679
to basically get out

1327.039 --> 1331.36
get out of this realm get out of the way

1329.679 --> 1334.3200000000002
you're nothing

1331.36 --> 1336.8799999999999
but a nasty parasite

1334.32 --> 1340.72
spiritual parasite

1336.88 --> 1343.7600000000002
wasting all your time and energy

1340.72 --> 1345.84
basically blowing all that potential

1343.76 --> 1347.039
that you don't even want to realize you

1345.84 --> 1348.559
had

1347.039 --> 1351.84
blowing it all

1348.559 --> 1355.6
on nagging people

1351.84 --> 1358.799
because of jealousy envy

1355.6 --> 1361.039
just pure malice yeah that's demonic

1358.799 --> 1365.039
that's what you do you come here to do

1361.039 --> 1365.039
that because you are a demon

1366.96 --> 1374.08
right the original real you

1370.72 --> 1376.72
would never consider doing such a thing

1374.08 --> 1378.32
because that's not something that makes

1376.72 --> 1381.44
you happy that's not something that

1378.32 --> 1383.6
leads to anything good it's just nasty

1381.44 --> 1386.4
and if you would have been confronted as

1383.6 --> 1389.6789999999999
your original self with somebody acting

1386.4 --> 1392.3200000000002
like that you would be utterly repulsed

1389.679 --> 1394.48
just like i am

1392.32 --> 1397.9189999999999
and that's how you know

1394.48 --> 1397.919
you are not yourself

1399.6 --> 1403.6
because now you're doing it and you feel

1401.679 --> 1407.0800000000002
nothing about it

1403.6 --> 1407.08
you're a monster

1430.08 --> 1434.799
of course he doesn't gadget inspector

1433.52 --> 1437.9189999999999
i mean

1434.799 --> 1439.84
you don't actually expect

1437.919 --> 1443.44
a goblin

1439.84 --> 1445.84
not directly overlorded

1443.44 --> 1448.559
by a commanding tyrant to actually do

1445.84 --> 1450.6399999999999
something productive with their time

1448.559 --> 1452.559
you can't be seriously expecting that

1450.64 --> 1454.7990000000002
right because that's what he is that's

1452.559 --> 1456.72
what you become spiritually

1454.799 --> 1458.32
nothing a little demon

1456.72 --> 1460.08
it's worthless everything about is

1458.32 --> 1462.48
worthless the less time you have to

1460.08 --> 1463.84
spend with it the better

1462.48 --> 1465.44
so there's nothing left you wouldn't

1463.84 --> 1467.6
expect the same thing

1465.44 --> 1470.72
from an elf

1467.6 --> 1470.7199999999998
or even a dwarf

1471.039 --> 1476.64
right they'll be ups and downs but

1473.919 --> 1478.96
they at least still have some kind of

1476.64 --> 1481.8400000000001
honor and sense of responsibility in

1478.96 --> 1484.0
order to start or attempt to start doing

1481.84 --> 1485.279
something productive with their day

1484.0 --> 1488.4
and admit

1485.279 --> 1490.96
when they're wrong towards themselves

1488.4 --> 1493.44
right you expect an elf or a dwarf and

1490.96 --> 1495.76
human too to do that you don't expect a

1493.44 --> 1498.72
goblin to do that

1495.76 --> 1501.36
because you know what goblins do

1498.72 --> 1503.44
see how that works

1501.36 --> 1506.4399999999998
that's right rubber digital demons got a

1503.44 --> 1506.44
demon

1514.08 --> 1517.1999999999998
hey nathan oakley

1526.08 --> 1531.12
right yeah but the thing is john lennon

1528.72 --> 1534.0
with everything you're trying to project

1531.12 --> 1537.12
onto me i know it's very difficult

1534.0 --> 1539.2
because you don't actually have a grip

1537.12 --> 1541.52
on how these mechanics work on how

1539.2 --> 1542.48
spirit mechanics work so you can't

1541.52 --> 1545.279
really

1542.48 --> 1547.52
just easily turn it inside out and apply

1545.279 --> 1549.919
to me because then the structure would

1547.52 --> 1552.8799999999999
be blatantly obviously off and you just

1549.919 --> 1556.4
look like incoherently rambling idiot so

1552.88 --> 1557.919
all you can do is just use the the words

1556.4 --> 1561.52
that i used

1557.919 --> 1564.5590000000002
separate them and then just add harm me

1561.52 --> 1566.96
with them without an explanation or a

1564.559 --> 1568.24
context see that's the only thing you

1566.96 --> 1571.039
have been doing that's the only thing

1568.24 --> 1572.96
you were doing yesterday because you are

1571.039 --> 1574.32
a vacant

1572.96 --> 1575.3600000000001
vapid

1574.32 --> 1578.08
idiot

1575.36 --> 1579.4399999999998
with a lot of negative feelings envy

1578.08 --> 1581.4399999999998
jealousy

1579.44 --> 1582.159
anger spite

1581.44 --> 1585.3600000000001
but

1582.159 --> 1587.6000000000001
no grip you don't have the grip you

1585.36 --> 1591.1999999999998
don't actually understand how things

1587.6 --> 1593.1999999999998
work you just know

1591.2 --> 1596.159
what you could potentially do with all

1593.2 --> 1598.48
that inner nastiness to try to

1596.159 --> 1600.88
weaken or unbalance others

1598.48 --> 1602.64
but you can't actually make an

1600.88 --> 1605.2
a comment

1602.64 --> 1608.0
a judgment in context because you don't

1605.2 --> 1610.8400000000001
understand anything

1608.0 --> 1614.32
you can't put

1610.84 --> 1618.08
accusations character descriptions into

1614.32 --> 1621.12
context with examples at all

1618.08 --> 1626.32
right as i am literally successfully

1621.12 --> 1628.559
doing that with you as you speak life

1626.32 --> 1633.039
constantly i did it for an hour straight

1628.559 --> 1633.039
yesterday and i'll do it again today

1635.36 --> 1642.08
no that's not an at home

1637.84 --> 1644.72
that's an in context analysis john levin

1642.08 --> 1647.6
you don't seem to understand

1644.72 --> 1650.799
what at home actually means you probably

1647.6 --> 1652.799
have very little grip on academics

1650.799 --> 1655.44
you heard the words you don't understand

1652.799 --> 1658.0
what they're actually used for

1655.44 --> 1660.559
in what field they actually apply and

1658.0 --> 1663.52
how the debating mechanics you don't

1660.559 --> 1666.08
know what debating mechanics are

1663.52 --> 1668.399
you're just parroting [ __ ] you read

1666.08 --> 1671.279
somewhere you heard somebody say and you

1668.399 --> 1675.12
think wow well he seems smart i'm gonna

1671.279 --> 1677.279
use that word now and try to attack

1675.12 --> 1679.76
because you're an idiot

1677.279 --> 1685.6
you're a vacant demon

1679.76 --> 1685.6
and demons act very simplistically

1689.12 --> 1692.52
hello agent

1697.84 --> 1702.559
ah yes nathan oh nathan did you see

1702.72 --> 1705.52
the live stream

1705.679 --> 1710.799
from mitchell from australia and

1708.0 --> 1712.799
sleeping warrior that was great

1710.799 --> 1715.279
he's gonna premiere it later but you

1712.799 --> 1716.8799999999999
really gotta watch that it was

1715.279 --> 1721.48
you're probably gonna want to mirror

1716.88 --> 1721.48
that [ __ ] it was really good

1734.0 --> 1737.0
hmm

1739.679 --> 1744.64
ah nathan i think pain love was probably

1742.88 --> 1746.64
higher than that i think the standard

1744.64 --> 1749.76
with this guy is 70 that's when he

1746.64 --> 1752.24
becomes active starts doing things

1749.76 --> 1753.44
probably when it's below 70 he probably

1752.24 --> 1755.6
is like

1753.44 --> 1757.2
extremely numb and depressed and doesn't

1755.6 --> 1760.1589999999999
do anything

1757.2 --> 1763.2
i think he's more in the direction of 90

1760.159 --> 1767.0390000000002
now just look at the

1763.2 --> 1768.559
the chain squirting in that last comment

1767.039 --> 1771.52
that's not

1768.559 --> 1775.48
maybe eighty percent

1771.52 --> 1775.48
it's pretty high

1784.159 --> 1787.159
ah

1799.279 --> 1807.24
you made a statement

1802.0 --> 1807.24
and my only response was no no it wasn't

1813.52 --> 1818.399
now you're the literal at home you're

1815.76 --> 1821.039
blindly accusing me of things without

1818.399 --> 1825.12
placing them in context

1821.039 --> 1829.2
merely projecting your dissatisfaction

1825.12 --> 1831.84
and then i describe what that behavior

1829.2 --> 1834.32
is like under which

1831.84 --> 1836.48
metaphorical context

1834.32 --> 1839.6
that could be place on the spectrum of

1836.48 --> 1839.6
behavior of people

1840.559 --> 1843.76
yeah

1841.36 --> 1846.799
but you still don't seem to understand

1843.76 --> 1847.679
even what it means when i say demon

1846.799 --> 1850.32
right

1847.679 --> 1853.1200000000001
i could have called you a devil but that

1850.32 --> 1855.9189999999999
would have been incorrect

1853.12 --> 1858.399
but you don't understand that

1855.919 --> 1860.64
because you understand very little of

1858.399 --> 1862.6399999999999
context because you don't pay attention

1860.64 --> 1865.519
i've explained all these things i made a

1862.64 --> 1868.0800000000002
special hangout with the title

1865.519 --> 1870.159
difference between demons and devils

1868.08 --> 1871.6789999999999
because there is a difference but you

1870.159 --> 1874.96
don't understand that you don't

1871.679 --> 1874.96
understand any of that

1875.76 --> 1878.559
you don't pay

1876.84 --> 1883.48
attention

1878.559 --> 1883.48
yeah hey tony whitcomb good to see you

1918.399 --> 1923.5189999999998
right

1919.6 --> 1923.519
oh it's not really gonna get to me now

1924.159 --> 1927.6000000000001
so yeah

1926.399 --> 1930.399
mr

1927.6 --> 1932.799
john lemon here is just kind of like

1930.399 --> 1935.9189999999999
hoping i will display levels of

1932.799 --> 1938.559
triggeredness like i did yesterday but

1935.919 --> 1940.3990000000001
that moment was over

1938.559 --> 1943.279
you see already conceded that was a

1940.399 --> 1943.279
moment of weakness

1944.399 --> 1952.1589999999999
and it's over i recognized it

1947.76 --> 1954.24
i sealed it i actually purified myself

1952.159 --> 1956.3200000000002
to un-trigger and worked quite

1954.24 --> 1958.96
successfully and i had a great night's

1956.32 --> 1962.08
sleep really good very restful and

1958.96 --> 1965.44
that's why i'm so focused now

1962.08 --> 1966.399
i got up early without a problem

1965.44 --> 1969.76
right

1966.399 --> 1972.32
he still wants he just wants me to be

1969.76 --> 1975.519
that weak guy again that that moment of

1972.32 --> 1978.559
weakness is all he dreams about

1975.519 --> 1980.48
it's like being in love

1978.559 --> 1982.559
with the torture victim that's what

1980.48 --> 1984.64
demons experience

1982.559 --> 1987.36
just obsess over

1984.64 --> 1990.0
that time they thought

1987.36 --> 1991.12
they were stronger

1990.0 --> 1994.08
literally

1991.12 --> 1995.6
demons obsess over moments

1994.08 --> 1998.399
where they thought

1995.6 --> 2000.799
they were stronger

1998.399 --> 2003.4399999999998
right and they'll they will chant

2000.799 --> 2005.519
anything to try to get that moment back

2003.44 --> 2007.2
it really is like a drug addiction like

2005.519 --> 2010.72
that they just

2007.2 --> 2013.1200000000001
they just want to feel like

2010.72 --> 2014.96
oh those flat earthers they don't know

2013.12 --> 2019.36
what they're talking about and they'll

2014.96 --> 2023.2
chant it all day long all all the time

2019.36 --> 2024.799
just to get that feeling back that they

2023.2 --> 2027.1200000000001
might have been

2024.799 --> 2029.12
somehow better having an edge over the

2027.12 --> 2031.9189999999999
other person

2029.12 --> 2035.279
they won't actually build or construct

2031.919 --> 2036.64
anything new or a piece of reasoning

2035.279 --> 2038.96
an argument

2036.64 --> 2042.0
to try to actually attain

2038.96 --> 2044.24
that position with recognition

2042.0 --> 2046.48
because they don't get

2044.24 --> 2050.8
real recognition anymore when you did

2046.48 --> 2052.2400000000002
when you become a demon you abandon

2050.8 --> 2054.0
recognition

2052.24 --> 2055.7599999999998
you don't pay attention to it anymore

2054.0 --> 2057.919
because you're a demon and nobody's

2055.76 --> 2059.76
gonna like you so when nobody's gonna

2057.919 --> 2061.359
like you you're gonna stop seeking

2059.76 --> 2063.9190000000003
recognition

2061.359 --> 2067.359
right you don't want to get your right

2063.919 --> 2069.52
from others you just want to feel

2067.359 --> 2072.48
that sensation

2069.52 --> 2073.52
like you were better

2072.48 --> 2075.359
yeah

2073.52 --> 2077.28
that's what that is it's called

2075.359 --> 2080.24
psychoanalysis

2077.28 --> 2080.2400000000002
deal with it fundy

2081.119 --> 2085.3990000000003
hey amanda young good to see you

2090.079 --> 2093.079
ugh

2109.04 --> 2112.04
so

2117.44 --> 2119.839
true

2119.92 --> 2125.599
no that's not that's

2122.4 --> 2127.52
i appreciate that return to normal but

2125.599 --> 2129.599
that is technically incorrect i was

2127.52 --> 2131.04
triggered hey and i do get triggered

2129.599 --> 2133.119
it's just that

2131.04 --> 2136.16
the me being or getting triggered was

2133.119 --> 2140.32
not the issue the issue was that i

2136.16 --> 2140.3199999999997
let myself go to a certain level

2140.96 --> 2146.079
i allowed it to manifest to take hold

2143.44 --> 2148.0
for a few moments that was really the

2146.079 --> 2150.96
problem but i did yeah

2148.0 --> 2152.96
i can get triggered dude

2150.96 --> 2155.119
on nathan's

2152.96 --> 2157.119
wednesday after show

2155.119 --> 2159.839
i was triggered right it happens but

2157.119 --> 2162.4
then i i restore i just like

2159.839 --> 2164.32
okay get your composure it's that error

2162.4 --> 2166.0
and then it's like oh wait wait okay

2164.32 --> 2170.28
okay

2166.0 --> 2170.28
just forget about it move on

2175.44 --> 2179.52
right because in actuality it's not

2177.599 --> 2181.04
really about whether you get triggered

2179.52 --> 2184.079
or not it's

2181.04 --> 2184.96
what do you learn from the moment how do

2184.079 --> 2188.0
you

2184.96 --> 2191.359
conceive of what has actually transpired

2188.0 --> 2194.88
and what do you do with it

2191.359 --> 2196.7999999999997
see are you gonna learn something

2194.88 --> 2199.6800000000003
or are you just

2196.8 --> 2202.2400000000002
gonna do it more and more and more and

2199.68 --> 2206.16
be very repetitive

2202.24 --> 2208.9599999999996
and then basically never stop doing it

2206.16 --> 2210.3199999999997
when you do that that's clear-cut

2208.96 --> 2213.2
evidence

2210.32 --> 2216.1600000000003
very solid evidence that you didn't

2213.2 --> 2217.9199999999996
learn from the mistake and then

2216.16 --> 2219.68
you don't learn from the mistake you

2217.92 --> 2221.6800000000003
hold on to that you hold on to that

2219.68 --> 2225.359
associated behavior

2221.68 --> 2225.359
then you become the mistake

2225.52 --> 2229.28
right when you troll and you don't stop

2227.839 --> 2231.44
trolling

2229.28 --> 2234.2400000000002
you become the troll

2231.44 --> 2235.839
or the demon if you will

2234.24 --> 2238.3999999999996
john lemon

2235.839 --> 2239.68
you come the demon that spirit becomes

2238.4 --> 2243.2000000000003
you

2239.68 --> 2244.72
you lose the normal human realizations

2243.2 --> 2247.359
and behavior

2244.72 --> 2250.0
human balance you lose it instead you

2247.359 --> 2254.48
surrender your consciousness your

2250.0 --> 2254.48
activities your consciousness engages in

2254.839 --> 2260.16
becomes goes in another direction

2258.48 --> 2262.16
another

2260.16 --> 2264.64
level of actions

2262.16 --> 2266.56
and yeah where you're stuck at

2264.64 --> 2268.56
through your behavior clear cut for

2266.56 --> 2271.44
everybody to see who has any kind of

2268.56 --> 2272.4
idea of how this works

2271.44 --> 2275.28
you're

2272.4 --> 2277.04
stuck in the demonic

2275.28 --> 2278.079
side of behavior

2277.04 --> 2280.32
right

2278.079 --> 2281.599
and that could be traditionally even

2280.32 --> 2282.56
religiously

2281.599 --> 2285.3590000000004
be

2282.56 --> 2286.32
considered being possessed by a demon

2285.359 --> 2287.7599999999998
right

2286.32 --> 2290.48
that's basically

2287.76 --> 2292.96
splitting up the different character

2290.48 --> 2294.16
railroads the character types a person

2292.96 --> 2296.0
can attain

2294.16 --> 2299.359
under different circumstances and levels

2296.0 --> 2301.52
of stress etc

2299.359 --> 2303.7599999999998
and then there like there is a demonic

2301.52 --> 2306.72
part there

2303.76 --> 2309.6800000000003
and if that part takes you over

2306.72 --> 2312.7999999999997
and you stick to that part that means

2309.68 --> 2315.359
effectively you are possessed

2312.8 --> 2318.48
by that

2315.359 --> 2320.4
you become that you lose the other

2318.48 --> 2321.52
options

2320.4 --> 2322.88
see

2321.52 --> 2324.8
that's what's

2322.88 --> 2328.4
being possessed

2324.8 --> 2328.4
practically entails

2329.119 --> 2334.0
i don't know how much more clear i can

2331.359 --> 2335.68
try to make this but

2334.0 --> 2337.28
right i know of course that john levin

2335.68 --> 2339.839
is not paying attention but i hope you

2337.28 --> 2341.6800000000003
guys are because this is this is real

2339.839 --> 2346.359
what i'm talking about that's real

2341.68 --> 2346.359
studied this my entire life

2355.119 --> 2359.2000000000003
don't say the word demonic yeah i know

2356.96 --> 2361.599
it's it's very much associated with a

2359.2 --> 2363.4399999999996
whole bunch of things

2361.599 --> 2366.079
but

2363.44 --> 2367.119
it is demonic though

2366.079 --> 2370.079
in the

2367.119 --> 2372.079
character spectrum of things

2370.079 --> 2375.04
the directives

2372.079 --> 2377.6800000000003
the sensations of what that is like

2375.04 --> 2378.88
that is classified demonic

2377.68 --> 2380.48
right it's not

2378.88 --> 2383.28
devilish

2380.48 --> 2386.8
it's definitely not angelic

2383.28 --> 2386.8
it's not animalistic

2387.04 --> 2391.04
it's demonic

2388.48 --> 2391.04
it's different

2392.079 --> 2398.32
constant ignorance

2394.96 --> 2400.8
abuse of all things it's like wanting

2398.32 --> 2403.92
to turn every

2400.8 --> 2405.119
glimpse of god inside out every glimpse

2403.92 --> 2407.6800000000003
of truth

2405.119 --> 2409.92
every element that you literally

2407.68 --> 2412.8799999999997
perceive through your consciousness

2409.92 --> 2414.56
every pebble has to be turned every

2412.88 --> 2417.04
thing has to be turned inside out

2414.56 --> 2418.319
because a demon cannot

2417.04 --> 2420.8
accept

2418.319 --> 2423.599
the truth

2420.8 --> 2425.92
creation that god exists and is in

2423.599 --> 2427.3590000000004
control they refuse

2425.92 --> 2430.48
that

2427.359 --> 2433.119
at all cost all costs

2430.48 --> 2436.64
any twist any mind twist everywhere they

2433.119 --> 2441.119
will go because they refuse to accept

2436.64 --> 2441.1189999999997
the truth and the truth is god

2441.76 --> 2446.6400000000003
lies are satan

2443.599 --> 2446.6400000000003
right but satan

2447.2 --> 2449.9199999999996
is

2448.4 --> 2453.44
complicated

2449.92 --> 2455.52
right satan is not

2453.44 --> 2458.16
literally a demon

2455.52 --> 2461.119
but he does represent

2458.16 --> 2463.52
like another mechanism

2461.119 --> 2466.1600000000003
of the whole

2463.52 --> 2468.079
so if you're gonna talk about psychology

2466.16 --> 2470.48
and individuals

2468.079 --> 2472.1600000000003
to draw satan in there is kind of

2470.48 --> 2474.8
illogical

2472.16 --> 2478.64
right unless you're going to talk pure

2474.8 --> 2478.6400000000003
esoterics and not psychology

2478.96 --> 2484.0
but to call it demonic

2481.359 --> 2484.0
it works

2484.96 --> 2489.839
because it is a description of character

2488.079 --> 2492.1600000000003
traits

2489.839 --> 2494.4
and the funny thing is that it had been

2492.16 --> 2498.3999999999996
well wide recorded

2494.4 --> 2501.599
like the behavioral spectrum of demons

2498.4 --> 2504.56
is very well analyzed even within

2501.599 --> 2507.599
what you could consider as fiction

2504.56 --> 2508.4
it's well defined it is understood

2507.599 --> 2511.52
by

2508.4 --> 2515.839
the subconscious even and that's why it

2511.52 --> 2517.68
is consistent it is a thing

2515.839 --> 2519.599
it's a thing

2517.68 --> 2520.839
in the psyche in

2519.599 --> 2524.2400000000002
in spirit

2520.839 --> 2524.24
mechanics anyway

2528.64 --> 2533.5989999999997
right nathan's

2531.44 --> 2536.599
flat earth debating this [ __ ] out of the

2533.599 --> 2536.599
chat

2540.0 --> 2543.2
mass

2541.76 --> 2545.5200000000004
yep

2543.2 --> 2547.68
gases don't have mass

2545.52 --> 2549.119
because in order to be classified to

2547.68 --> 2552.24
have mass

2549.119 --> 2555.359
you have to have inertia you have to be

2552.24 --> 2556.4799999999996
susceptible to momentum and gases are

2555.359 --> 2559.04
not

2556.48 --> 2560.16
only liquids and solids

2559.04 --> 2562.4
are

2560.16 --> 2565.3999999999996
have inertia and are susceptible to

2562.4 --> 2565.4
momentum

2566.16 --> 2572.8799999999997
so gas effectively does not have mass

2570.079 --> 2575.2000000000003
even though in

2572.88 --> 2578.6400000000003
in your physics book

2575.2 --> 2580.7999999999997
it might have a number associated that's

2578.64 --> 2583.52
that's associated with mass but that's

2580.8 --> 2586.8
actually a derivative

2583.52 --> 2589.359
a derivative from the density

2586.8 --> 2591.8390000000004
atomic mass is what i think it's called

2589.359 --> 2594.0789999999997
right it's conceptual it's not actually

2591.839 --> 2595.359
it's still not mass

2594.079 --> 2597.3590000000004
because

2595.359 --> 2599.359
you can't apply it

2597.359 --> 2601.2799999999997
that way

2599.359 --> 2602.56
because yeah hey

2601.28 --> 2603.3590000000004
gases

2602.56 --> 2606.48
or

2603.359 --> 2610.0
atom types that are normally in gaseous

2606.48 --> 2613.599
state still have these atomic masses

2610.0 --> 2616.56
but yeah when you weigh them

2613.599 --> 2618.96
as you would weigh traditional weight it

2616.56 --> 2621.7599999999998
doesn't actually then have mass because

2618.96 --> 2623.359
in things in gaseous states don't have

2621.76 --> 2626.7200000000003
inertia

2623.359 --> 2630.72
so mass is just a derived mechanical

2626.72 --> 2633.4399999999996
concept that is not universal not all

2630.72 --> 2636.48
things have mass

2633.44 --> 2636.48
gases do not

2637.04 --> 2639.839
yeah what's this

2640.48 --> 2642.72
it

2645.119 --> 2649.56
gravity is an apparent force

2651.04 --> 2655.52
oh come on nathan that's almost too

2653.04 --> 2657.119
funny to the leap

2655.52 --> 2660.16
[ __ ]

2657.119 --> 2663.1600000000003
is that is that really necessary

2660.16 --> 2663.16
uh

2664.16 --> 2669.2
believes no it's provable and i made a

2666.96 --> 2672.48
case i literally explained it john lemon

2669.2 --> 2675.96
but yeah go and chant for us again funny

2672.48 --> 2675.96
chant for us

2697.76 --> 2702.8
ah it's a challenge return to normal to

2700.48 --> 2705.359
try and explain it i hope you paid

2702.8 --> 2707.8390000000004
attention i did basically explain it

2705.359 --> 2707.839
just now

2708.16 --> 2716.7999999999997
but yeah mass is not so easily defined

2713.28 --> 2719.6800000000003
right it's not a universal element

2716.8 --> 2722.1600000000003
to all matter

2719.68 --> 2724.56
even though in your physics book the

2722.16 --> 2727.68
spectrum of matter

2724.56 --> 2728.64
the periodic table will

2727.68 --> 2732.3999999999996
show

2728.64 --> 2733.92
mass with every atom

2732.4 --> 2737.28
it will

2733.92 --> 2740.079
but that's different it's not the same

2737.28 --> 2740.079
mechanism

2741.359 --> 2746.48
because

2742.48 --> 2748.72
mass effectively is different per state

2746.48 --> 2748.72
right

2749.28 --> 2753.3590000000004
for example liquid hydrogen heavily

2751.839 --> 2755.44
pressurized

2753.359 --> 2758.16
does have mass it will

2755.44 --> 2760.96
in its liquid state

2758.16 --> 2764.16
be susceptible to momentum it will have

2760.96 --> 2767.68
inertia and so it will register with

2764.16 --> 2771.24
weight but in its gaseous state

2767.68 --> 2771.24
it will not

2775.599 --> 2779.76
i did clary that's interesting

2778.64 --> 2782.56
all right

2779.76 --> 2782.5600000000004
i didn't know that

2785.68 --> 2788.8799999999997
all right nathan oakley

2787.52 --> 2791.119
thanks for being here in chat that was

2788.88 --> 2791.119
fun

2793.04 --> 2797.96
i'll see you in the fed chat

2808.8 --> 2813.2000000000003
wow yeah wait hey john lemon you know

2811.599 --> 2814.6400000000003
about cult

2813.2 --> 2817.2
cults

2814.64 --> 2818.24
what they actually do right

2817.2 --> 2821.68
is

2818.24 --> 2824.319
they quickly ban people

2821.68 --> 2828.64
that made arguments that they cannot

2824.319 --> 2831.599
refute right now i've let you blabber on

2828.64 --> 2832.8799999999997
for an hour almost at least half an hour

2831.599 --> 2835.76
in chat

2832.88 --> 2837.119
and i'm just leaving you do that

2835.76 --> 2839.8390000000004
why

2837.119 --> 2843.92
because flat earth my show and the

2839.839 --> 2846.96
people that follow my show is not a cult

2843.92 --> 2848.7200000000003
because we don't have anything

2846.96 --> 2851.359
that we cannot

2848.72 --> 2853.68
have being exposed to the outside well

2851.359 --> 2854.7999999999997
there's no secrets there's no secret

2853.68 --> 2857.52
formula

2854.8 --> 2861.3590000000004
we don't want disgust

2857.52 --> 2864.24
because we have based it on reality

2861.359 --> 2866.48
right because it's not a cult

2864.24 --> 2868.7999999999997
right all your attempts

2866.48 --> 2871.76
to smear me

2868.8 --> 2874.4
call us cults and cults and cults that's

2871.76 --> 2877.28
super cute but you haven't actually

2874.4 --> 2879.119
refuted any argument and that's why

2877.28 --> 2882.559
you're not a threat and why i'm just

2879.119 --> 2885.839
leaving you in my chat to do that

2882.559 --> 2889.52
right because what you say in my chat is

2885.839 --> 2891.52
effectively not a threat

2889.52 --> 2894.559
to my legacy here

2891.52 --> 2898.44
to what i do it's literally not a threat

2894.559 --> 2898.44
it's merely a nuisance

2900.8 --> 2908.4
right you're not halting the development

2905.04 --> 2911.44
you're not weakening the integrity

2908.4 --> 2911.44
of the ideas

2911.68 --> 2914.9199999999996
at all

2928.16 --> 2932.64
yeah you seem to be suffering from a

2930.16 --> 2934.96
little dementia here because nathan for

2932.64 --> 2938.0789999999997
example has been

2934.96 --> 2940.16
sharing with you the facts

2938.079 --> 2943.2000000000003
why the earth cannot be a spinning ball

2940.16 --> 2946.5589999999997
in outer space that space

2943.2 --> 2948.5589999999997
that the heliocentric model suggests it

2946.559 --> 2952.4
is

2948.559 --> 2954.079
and that's part of a routine on his show

2952.4 --> 2958.96
that he does daily

2954.079 --> 2961.52
yet you seem to have some dementia there

2958.96 --> 2963.52
because we are constantly addressing why

2961.52 --> 2966.559
the earth cannot be a globe

2963.52 --> 2969.599
and when somebody picks up on that or

2966.559 --> 2971.0400000000004
tries to refute that then we can lay out

2969.599 --> 2972.7200000000003
the mechanics

2971.04 --> 2974.319
and eventually

2972.72 --> 2977.2799999999997
even reference

2974.319 --> 2980.5589999999997
history historical facts

2977.28 --> 2982.88
and current they accepted scientific

2980.559 --> 2985.0400000000004
statements and literature

2982.88 --> 2987.359
and explanations about natural law that

2985.04 --> 2991.599
are officially accepted

2987.359 --> 2993.5989999999997
to back up our claims yeah the thing is

2991.599 --> 2994.6400000000003
though john lemon

2993.599 --> 2997.6400000000003
you

2994.64 --> 2997.64
don't

2998.72 --> 3003.1189999999997
you don't

3000.48 --> 3004.8
there's a bunch of misinformation out

3003.119 --> 3005.52
there

3004.8 --> 3007.6800000000003
but

3005.52 --> 3010.64
if you read carefully

3007.68 --> 3014.3999999999996
you will literally find out that

3010.64 --> 3017.2799999999997
the it's broken mechanics

3014.4 --> 3018.559
it doesn't actually abide by natural

3017.28 --> 3021.28
laws

3018.559 --> 3023.44
it makes you presuppose a natural

3021.28 --> 3025.0400000000004
condition that could never happen to

3023.44 --> 3026.88
make its case

3025.04 --> 3029.2
these things

3026.88 --> 3032.0
are in there constantly it's called

3029.2 --> 3036.72
machinations

3032.0 --> 3039.599
built to deceive by people in the know

3036.72 --> 3040.64
that they are building it to deceive

3039.599 --> 3042.96
you see

3040.64 --> 3045.44
but just because it is built to deceive

3042.96 --> 3048.559
doesn't mean that you can't prove

3045.44 --> 3051.44
it's built to deceive we can do that

3048.559 --> 3054.1600000000003
we've been trained at it here as flat

3051.44 --> 3058.319
earthers we've trained ourselves to

3054.16 --> 3061.92
identify machinations and work out how

3058.319 --> 3063.7599999999998
they are machinations you see

3061.92 --> 3066.96
the thing is

3063.76 --> 3070.1600000000003
you can't reciprocate that

3066.96 --> 3072.079
because the things that we base

3070.16 --> 3074.0789999999997
our intel

3072.079 --> 3076.7200000000003
our lore on

3074.079 --> 3080.079
the mechanisms that we make our cases

3076.72 --> 3083.68
with are officially accepted and cannot

3080.079 --> 3087.119
be refuted without resorting once again

3083.68 --> 3089.1189999999997
to a machination that references it

3087.119 --> 3091.359
takes it out of whack

3089.119 --> 3095.04
makes it impossible and makes you

3091.359 --> 3096.96
presuppose unnatural situations

3095.04 --> 3098.319
that are even admittedly unnatural

3096.96 --> 3101.28
situations

3098.319 --> 3104.079
within that piece often of a lot of the

3101.28 --> 3104.079
time right

3105.839 --> 3109.96
so i wish you the best of luck

3111.2 --> 3117.04
you can just spam all all day long

3115.76 --> 3119.119
just project

3117.04 --> 3122.16
i don't care i'll just let you do that

3119.119 --> 3125.839
dude i i'm not even gonna remove you i'm

3122.16 --> 3125.839
just gonna let you

3126.0 --> 3131.76
pump that diary out

3128.4 --> 3131.76
for as long as you need

3133.28 --> 3138.3190000000004
eventually you'll be

3135.28 --> 3140.96
quite empty and then you'll just stop

3138.319 --> 3143.68
because you don't have the energy left

3140.96 --> 3145.76
because it's not being refilled because

3143.68 --> 3147.5989999999997
it's not leading to anything you're not

3145.76 --> 3150.1600000000003
actually finding connections with

3147.599 --> 3152.48
anything you say

3150.16 --> 3155.52
you're just venting outrage

3152.48 --> 3158.319
over your unwillingness to accept

3155.52 --> 3161.319
the reality of the situation for what it

3158.319 --> 3161.319
is

3177.359 --> 3180.359
right

3183.04 --> 3186.72
that's correct robert digital

3190.8 --> 3195.28
man and by the way the way the day is

3193.92 --> 3198.7200000000003
way

3195.28 --> 3201.599
too delightful to ever be ruined by some

3198.72 --> 3204.0
basement dweller dwelling

3201.599 --> 3206.1600000000003
demon troll

3204.0 --> 3208.4
right the thing is about people that

3206.16 --> 3211.5989999999997
[ __ ] their pants

3208.4 --> 3213.76
especially when it comes to internet

3211.599 --> 3216.319
it's only the people that [ __ ] their

3213.76 --> 3218.8
pants that get to smell the [ __ ] and the

3216.319 --> 3220.48
ones that are living directly surround

3218.8 --> 3223.28
around them

3220.48 --> 3225.52
so yeah i don't have to smell the [ __ ]

3223.28 --> 3225.52
right

3228.88 --> 3233.96
look at that weather it's just amazing

3239.2 --> 3242.7599999999998
gorgeous site

3264.079 --> 3268.079
yeah yeah that that's

3265.92 --> 3270.4
you're lucky man

3268.079 --> 3275.079
yeah you're not gonna spout that [ __ ]

3270.4 --> 3275.079
you're not gonna say that [ __ ]

3284.799 --> 3288.48
yeah

3286.559 --> 3291.599
dude lemon

3288.48 --> 3293.76
it's better if you just let the pain go

3291.599 --> 3295.6800000000003
through you

3293.76 --> 3297.92
just accept it

3295.68 --> 3300.72
accept the truth accept the pain for

3297.92 --> 3302.319
what it is stop trying to escape it just

3300.72 --> 3304.319
let it in

3302.319 --> 3307.599
let it hurt you

3304.319 --> 3311.2
let it hurt you and do not act on it

3307.599 --> 3312.88
this is actually genuine good personal

3311.2 --> 3314.8799999999997
advice i'm giving you right now you're

3312.88 --> 3317.44
probably not gonna do it or if you're

3314.88 --> 3318.799
gonna try it you're not gonna admit that

3317.44 --> 3320.799
you're trying it

3318.799 --> 3324.4
under my advice

3320.799 --> 3328.48
if you just let it hurt

3324.4 --> 3330.7200000000003
and just accept reality for what it is

3328.48 --> 3332.96
you might actually get a little stronger

3330.72 --> 3338.24
out of this you might actually get a

3332.96 --> 3339.52
chance to step away from the demon again

3338.24 --> 3342.0789999999997
and

3339.52 --> 3343.68
return to who you really are

3342.079 --> 3345.6800000000003
underneath all that

3343.68 --> 3348.8799999999997
don't you want that don't you want to be

3345.68 --> 3351.359
a human being again

3348.88 --> 3354.96
well the way to do it is to just

3351.359 --> 3357.44
let the hurt in let it hurt

3354.96 --> 3358.64
and don't act on the hurt just let it go

3357.44 --> 3362.319
through there it's not gonna last

3358.64 --> 3365.52
forever once you engage

3362.319 --> 3368.16
right and you'll get stronger for it

3365.52 --> 3370.799
actually stronger not stronger as in a

3368.16 --> 3373.2799999999997
stronger more ferocious demon piece of

3370.799 --> 3376.0
[ __ ] but you might actually get some

3373.28 --> 3378.1600000000003
sensible realization that will dissuade

3376.0 --> 3381.28
you from engaging

3378.16 --> 3381.2799999999997
in acting like this

3389.2 --> 3391.839
uh

3392.88 --> 3397.04
well that was fun i think i'm gonna

3394.64 --> 3400.16
round out the show

3397.04 --> 3400.16
kinda hungry anyway

3403.839 --> 3408.0
and i mean at some point yeah

3409.2 --> 3414.72
at some point you just gotta let the

3411.68 --> 3414.72
lemon dry up

3415.92 --> 3419.44
see

3417.28 --> 3420.88
sometimes you just gotta let the lemon

3419.44 --> 3422.96
dry

3420.88 --> 3427.799
and then it's

3422.96 --> 3427.799
it's a little hard it's very light

3453.2 --> 3457.5989999999997
yeah oh thank you by the way

3456.24 --> 3462.24
adam mekin

3457.599 --> 3464.6400000000003
for assistance i appreciate that

3462.24 --> 3467.359
he's getting actually he's

3464.64 --> 3470.5589999999997
he's taking another step down the ladder

3467.359 --> 3470.5589999999997
isn't that just special

3471.68 --> 3474.839
you know

3476.48 --> 3481.04
you can

3477.839 --> 3484.0789999999997
suggest to a person

3481.04 --> 3487.2799999999997
going down the ladder of hell

3484.079 --> 3492.799
that they could maybe decide to get back

3487.28 --> 3492.799
up but you can't make him go up though

3493.359 --> 3496.24
right

3494.24 --> 3499.2799999999997
and the further down you go the more

3496.24 --> 3502.3999999999996
diluted you get and then any suggestion

3499.28 --> 3504.96
from top down from up there

3502.4 --> 3507.119
that it might be better to get up

3504.96 --> 3509.599
it might be turned inside out in their

3507.119 --> 3512.4
mind and just invigorate their

3509.599 --> 3514.2400000000002
delusional mission no no no that means i

3512.4 --> 3515.6800000000003
have to go down further

3514.24 --> 3518.24
because if i'm down

3515.68 --> 3523.1189999999997
far enough down this ladder

3518.24 --> 3526.319
then i might not hear it anymore

3523.119 --> 3526.319
it's called white noise

3526.96 --> 3531.68
isn't that just special

3529.28 --> 3534.1600000000003
right

3531.68 --> 3534.16
anyway

3543.359 --> 3549.52
you're a sick sick [ __ ]

3545.92 --> 3549.52
john lemon you're really sick

3551.44 --> 3556.16
right

3553.52 --> 3558.64
you might want to stop those

3556.16 --> 3561.5989999999997
stop watching those types of videos

3558.64 --> 3562.8799999999997
before the secret service catches on to

3561.599 --> 3565.28
you

3562.88 --> 3565.28
all right

3565.76 --> 3572.6400000000003
john lemon

3568.0 --> 3574.48
they will eventually catch you you know

3572.64 --> 3577.04
all right anyway

3574.48 --> 3578.48
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

3577.04 --> 3580.72
like this show

3578.48 --> 3582.88
if you actually did then please don't

3580.72 --> 3584.799
forget to rogan's it up and if you

3582.88 --> 3586.6400000000003
