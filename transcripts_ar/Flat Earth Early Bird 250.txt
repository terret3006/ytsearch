so yeah the weather today roof well it's

72.55 --> 78.229
better now but yeah I went for some

76.1 --> 82.88
groceries today and had to go through a

78.229 --> 86.72
full on rainstorm but yeah I anticipated

82.88 --> 90.71
that so I went on my bike with an

86.72 --> 92.53999999999999
umbrella and no accidents it's kind of

90.71 --> 94.97
tough like holding up an umbrella when

92.54 --> 98.08000000000001
it's also blowing and everything so it's

94.97 --> 100.7
like a strength test what I can do it

98.08 --> 105.38
done it many times so I stayed pretty

100.7 --> 109.10000000000001
much dry except for my legs yeah but

105.38 --> 112.03999999999999
yeah I don't know I like it I like a

109.1 --> 114.77
change and hey good for the plants nice

112.04 --> 120.47
and green so yeah I got to Myra coffee

114.77 --> 126.08
with me and tea that's it let's see who

120.47 --> 130.009
is in check all right so Hagrid wells

126.08 --> 135.29
came in early had a long discussion with

130.009 --> 138.79999999999998
him yeah and I was discussing something

135.29 --> 141.849
I'll get into right after that so then

138.8 --> 145.06
stone monkey came in more coloured

141.849 --> 145.06
Amanda young

147.76 --> 156.91
Alber Mukul Lord sloth of all yea good

156.2 --> 163.42999999999998
this year

156.91 --> 166.94
so yeah hos they had a an open panel

163.43 --> 169.55
thingy like in the morning and I was up

166.94 --> 173.03
really early today I don't know what it

169.55 --> 177.14000000000001
was but it's weird I went to bed pretty

173.03 --> 179.72
late but yeah I was gaming and I was

177.14 --> 182.80999999999997
literally like yeah almost

179.72 --> 184.58
it sounds like it's like getting so

182.81 --> 186.59
sleepy that you get all teary eyed and

184.58 --> 189.02
everything but I tried to pull through

186.59 --> 191.57
it but I don't know my rhythm seems to

189.02 --> 197.09
have been set now pretty early because I

191.57 --> 198.48999999999998
just wake up at half past eight even if

197.09 --> 201.35
I go late

198.49 --> 204.86
later than twelve o'clock to bed I don't

201.35 --> 209.09
know what that is but I'm fine with it

204.86 --> 213.95000000000002
and an early rhythm is much been better

209.09 --> 216.86
for my energy household it's much easier

213.95 --> 219.26
like if I have a late rhythm then I tend

216.86 --> 221.75
to be a little bit more dreamy but that

219.26 --> 224.87
also makes me more easily distracted and

221.75 --> 227.36
more easily depressive also yeah

224.87 --> 229.31
I felt pretty strong even though I

227.36 --> 235.13000000000002
didn't get a full night's sleep I guess

229.31 --> 237.38
and then Jose went live I saw it when I

235.13 --> 239.9
came online he was going for like hours

237.38 --> 245.9
already so I decided to join him because

239.9 --> 248.84
spur schema was on there and he was

245.9 --> 252.86
going and going about his freaking there

248.84 --> 257.62
is no gas pressure and it was getting so

252.86 --> 261.68
bad that I just jumped in there and

257.62 --> 266.18
basically joined that guy's name a

261.68 --> 269.51
baller that normally with we're always

266.18 --> 273.23
in arguments so yeah we pretty much

269.51 --> 277.61
established that we probably disagree

273.23 --> 279.91900000000004
about 95 to 99 percent of everything but

277.61 --> 280.879
in this case it was just so ridiculous

279.919 --> 283.849
that

280.879 --> 289.03900000000004
I had to step in and spur schema was

283.849 --> 291.229
basically constantly demanding we show

289.039 --> 294.08
some kind of physical proof physical

291.229 --> 296.33
proof but he never did it himself so

294.08 --> 299.029
every time we asked like yeah well well

296.33 --> 301.99899999999997
can you demonstrate your setup the way

299.029 --> 304.759
you speculate things are going on

301.999 --> 307.42900000000003
supposedly with temperature and he

304.759 --> 309.91900000000004
doesn't do it and then then he says yeah

307.429 --> 313.06899999999996
you're just saying that because you're

309.919 --> 319.18899999999996
not doing it and he was just falling

313.069 --> 324.349
into Brenda level tactics and I got

319.189 --> 326.36
pretty agitated so yeah it's no full-on

324.349 --> 329.99
or witty enrage because I didn't really

326.36 --> 335.11
need to but like I feel a little

329.99 --> 335.11
nauseated just thinking back about it I

335.83 --> 344.349
don't know what the hell's wrong with

338.059 --> 349.72900000000004
that guy but it just feels wrong and and

344.349 --> 355.339
he again also was literally personally

349.729 --> 358.00899999999996
attacking my life basically when I was

355.339 --> 359.779
going at him and criticizing for his

358.009 --> 362.18
approach and like what are you doing

359.779 --> 364.129
this this is hypocrite all that pointing

362.18 --> 365.059
at what was literally going on right

364.129 --> 367.72900000000004
there on the spot

365.059 --> 370.339
and he told me like her what are you

367.729 --> 375.349
doing begging for money and don't you

370.339 --> 379.939
feel ashamed it like whoa you know again

375.349 --> 382.36899999999997
I need this again Thanks like I don't

379.939 --> 387.529
get enough of that [ __ ] and I'm pretty

382.369 --> 391.939
open and honest about it so it was just

387.529 --> 395.719
it was weird because every time I do do

391.939 --> 397.999
this like baller trolls that normally

395.719 --> 400.30899999999997
are just [ __ ] all over me they

397.999 --> 402.499
suddenly ladies get all these weird

400.309 --> 406.069
remarks like her it's very uncomfortable

402.499 --> 410.99
when I actually agree with Arwen it is

406.069 --> 414.74
hilarious but it also does give me some

410.99 --> 424.099
hope that they're not delusional

414.74 --> 426.59000000000003
purpose a lot of them so you know that

424.099 --> 429.259
because otherwise they just attack

426.59 --> 431.56899999999996
anything they wouldn't see the

429.259 --> 433.58000000000004
difference anymore that's when that's

431.569 --> 437.06
what happens when it's over politicized

433.58 --> 438.85999999999996
that's when you get the act they're real

437.06 --> 440.84
crazies they are so politicized

438.86 --> 443.3
everything and just everything becomes

440.84 --> 447.409
only about winning in the moment and

443.3 --> 450.849
nothing matters anymore and well at

447.409 --> 450.849
least they didn't do that Oh

454.069 --> 461.15000000000003
fyodor dostoyevsky hello okay that's he

458.96 --> 463.54999999999995
says Spurs is trying to force our win

461.15 --> 467.98999999999995
out of Oakley show but that is just my

463.55 --> 471.77000000000004
opinion I did does he really

467.99 --> 477.349
I don't know I haven't went to the

471.77 --> 479.33
Nathan Oakley show and I'm not leave

477.349 --> 481.88
yeah it's not like I'm not going there

479.33 --> 484.19
just because of spurs chemo but he's not

481.88 --> 490.909
exactly helping but it is because of all

484.19 --> 494.15
of them it's because of Brenda like one

490.909 --> 496.49
of the big issues it's like always the

494.15 --> 500.09
same crap always the straight-faced lies

496.49 --> 502.88
and it's just getting really old and

500.09 --> 506.27
then there's others people like Wiggles

502.88 --> 510.65
who is not that bad but also a pretty

506.27 --> 512.4499999999999
damn bad and all of them always do the

510.65 --> 516.2289999999999
same things and that's just getting

512.45 --> 518.75
really old to me because we're getting

516.229 --> 523.19
stuck to just ping ponging against the

518.75 --> 525.41
same old same old and not really moving

523.19 --> 527.899
anywhere and then spurs kemo comes in

525.41 --> 532.85
and supposedly oh look I found something

527.899 --> 534.68
new which is just absurd what he

532.85 --> 536.839
suggests and every time he dressed

534.68 --> 540.41
indoctrinate everyone always when it

536.839 --> 542.87
starts up his his thing his little

540.41 --> 545.449
little rumpus routine that Spurs chemo

542.87 --> 548.48
routine so it's like you know we don't

545.449 --> 552.62
we don't experience pressure

548.48 --> 559.13
oh we don't experience pressure you got

552.62 --> 561.86
it just it doesn't exist mmm and it's

559.13 --> 566.18
just creeping the hell out of me

561.86 --> 568.16
that he does that every time it

566.18 --> 570.529
literally feels like he's trying to

568.16 --> 574.6
induct the indoctrinate for a repetition

570.529 --> 578.99
something that is literally like a

574.6 --> 580.7900000000001
desensitizing spell trying to make

578.99 --> 583.449
everyone think that they don't feel

580.79 --> 587.68
pressure making them doubt their own

583.449 --> 587.68
experiences it's just absurd

587.8 --> 593.329
and it feels wrong it feels so damn

591.32 --> 599.69
wrong that it feels like it's not a game

593.329 --> 601.31
and I must basically stand there at the

599.69 --> 603.23
sidelines because there's nothing I can

601.31 --> 608.0
do with this guy absolutely not very

603.23 --> 611.389
obviously very obviously so but I have

608.0 --> 614.0
to I can't just let him do his thing and

611.389 --> 618.73
let everybody be dragged down with them

614.0 --> 618.73
into that weirdo world where it just

618.94 --> 625.339
things completely snap out of the

622.19 --> 628.0100000000001
picture don't exist and anymore things

625.339 --> 630.0790000000001
are cognitive dissonance out of reality

628.01 --> 633.25
as I call it that's what he's trying to

630.079 --> 633.25
do it's so freaky

633.31 --> 638.1389999999999
it's constructing an alternative reality

638.769 --> 649.579
not figuring out reality through proper

645.22 --> 652.37
experimentation but just yeah figuring

649.579 --> 655.0889999999999
out a new way ignoring certain elements

652.37 --> 657.98
you know you could compare it to

655.089 --> 660.6800000000001
claiming that there's just no there

657.98 --> 663.019
there's more than two genders kind of

660.68 --> 667.55
thing or that there's more than two

663.019 --> 669.62
sexes that's also just like that

667.55 --> 671.3
doesn't make sense but if you keep on

669.62 --> 674.42
saying it and often enough and

671.3 --> 676.76
encouraging it and showing glory and all

674.42 --> 678.8
that and they're so good pens people

676.76 --> 681.529
will take it over that's what's happened

678.8 --> 681.92
and spur schema seems to be having is

681.529 --> 687.22
only

681.92 --> 689.99
Wizardry attempt here to try to force

687.22 --> 697.07
hypnotize us into believing that we

689.99 --> 699.88
don't experience pressure it's absurd so

697.07 --> 699.88
yeah that happened

703.24 --> 714.07
Malati they try yeah they try to but I

710.089 --> 714.07
went for the the alternative

714.56 --> 718.3599999999999
[Music]

722.34 --> 725.46
[Music]

728.29 --> 738.05
all right so yeah that happened oh hey

737.0 --> 741.199
thank you

738.05 --> 742.79
is it cuz I is flat for the two pounds

741.199 --> 746.05
super jet donation well done keep it

742.79 --> 749.899
going keep it real I will do my best

746.05 --> 751.8499999999999
absolutely well yeah and I just hope not

749.899 --> 756.709
more people are gonna do this kind of

751.85 --> 761.889
thing and you know if you try something

756.709 --> 765.92
out that's okay but if you're gonna like

761.889 --> 768.199
get into like oh yeah this is real let's

765.92 --> 771.9699999999999
go for the assault and start using

768.199 --> 775.209
tactics and everything not so good

771.97 --> 779.12
look I tried it with the speed of light

775.209 --> 781.16
but it's yeah and I had like a really

779.12 --> 783.88
good feeling about it like I'm not

781.16 --> 786.56
seeing it and now for the first time

783.88 --> 788.899
since two days ago I've seen something

786.56 --> 791.1199999999999
that made me draw that into doubt

788.899 --> 793.67
because I am searching for the truth

791.12 --> 796.699
because I really want the real thing

793.67 --> 800.8389999999999
and if something is good enough that

796.699 --> 808.8499999999999
it's like empirically obvious then I

800.839 --> 810.35
must follow my senses so yeah I didn't

808.85 --> 811.91
show that video by the way I assure you

810.35 --> 830.7090000000001
I should probably do that

811.91 --> 830.709
I do have it I'll see if I can wait no

830.889 --> 840.769
thank you James Park well you know with

838.339 --> 843.8000000000001
quantum eraser it's mostly just saying

840.769 --> 846.769
no because you barely get a chance to

843.8 --> 849.199
get in between but if you just say no

846.769 --> 851.569
and you don't let him roll over you and

849.199 --> 854.75
then just say okay okay to try to get

851.569 --> 859.91
along and we just say no and don't get

854.75 --> 865.279
agitated then you get out stronger than

859.91 --> 867.259
expected so and at this point I'll be

865.279 --> 870.38
honest I'm basically avoiding John I

867.259 --> 875.809
just don't don't feel like being around

870.38 --> 887.779
that wait what I was looking for oh yeah

875.809 --> 889.579
the video um see am I gonna do that no

887.779 --> 896.149
that doesn't work oh wait it does work

889.579 --> 899.0
wow that's that's freaking hilarious I

896.149 --> 905.089
never thought of trying that just take a

899.0 --> 907.79
video and draw it into into Firefox and

905.089 --> 910.48
there it goes it just it's a player I'd

907.79 --> 913.48
I never even tried that that's hilarious

910.48 --> 913.48
okay

918.81 --> 922.3399999999999
although I'm getting there

926.1 --> 937.53
yeah alright so there you go Oh volume I

934.77 --> 940.35
need to keep track of my volume because

937.53 --> 942.24
I put it in a range where it should be

940.35 --> 944.58
good but if I get a little louder than

942.24 --> 949.53
it really out noises it so I should pay

944.58 --> 953.73
more attention to that so anyway so here

949.53 --> 956.04
he basically explains very in detail the

953.73 --> 957.8100000000001
setup of what he's doing I'm gonna skip

956.04 --> 960.3
that because I'm not showing your volume

957.81 --> 963.4799999999999
anyway literally like how to make it

960.3 --> 968.9699999999999
it's it's extremely detailed this thing

963.48 --> 972.0600000000001
and then yeah he assembles the machine

968.97 --> 975.75
and what he does is he mesh measures the

972.06 --> 979.2199999999999
pulse and then basically compares the

975.75 --> 979.22
two feet

982.08 --> 989.5500000000001
it's yeah and because it is digitally

986.339 --> 995.6600000000001
represented he can scale it scale it up

989.55 --> 999.06
so that way he can actually get

995.66 --> 1000.68
deducible from the the light speed and

999.06 --> 1003.8
that's what he's done so he basically

1000.68 --> 1005.769
made a hand a device that's literally

1003.8 --> 1008.4499999999999
sending a signal and two measuring

1005.769 --> 1012.86
systems at the start and way at the

1008.45 --> 1020.57
receiver and you can yeah this is the

1012.86 --> 1024.85
thing and you can change it manually so

1020.57 --> 1029.27
he basically moves the pole away and

1024.85 --> 1032.9289999999999
then yeah literally the distance changes

1029.27 --> 1035.809
so that's just an on-the-spot

1032.929 --> 1039.77
it's not like something he calculates no

1035.809 --> 1042.3799999999999
he just the calculation the deduction

1039.77 --> 1047.59
system has been set up has been properly

1042.38 --> 1051.8000000000002
a program as it were in a certain yeah

1047.59 --> 1054.05
repeatable open systems nothing sneaky I

1051.8 --> 1055.9099999999999
presume he made it all from scratch he

1054.05 --> 1058.6399999999999
can't get more raw than that

1055.91 --> 1061.8200000000002
I hear he does some calculations let's

1058.64 --> 1063.919
not get into that that's this this is

1061.82 --> 1069.98
not my thing you know yeah he'd this

1063.919 --> 1072.0800000000002
guy's he he knows his [ __ ] yeah I should

1069.98 --> 1075.85
find the original video and link up but

1072.08 --> 1080.33
I got this video from somebody in chat

1075.85 --> 1085.27
but anyway yeah he just measures as he

1080.33 --> 1085.27
goes in the indus or was at the part

1087.16 --> 1091.66
this so he can just measure it

1092.66 --> 1098.6000000000001
from the beginning pulse to the end

1094.85 --> 1103.1
pulse then deduce the actual distance

1098.6 --> 1105.9399999999998
and you get a variation in the yeah they

1103.1 --> 1110.87
receive part and these end parts and

1105.94 --> 1115.25
yeah you can it's raw data he does it on

1110.87 --> 1117.8
the spot so this brings severe doubts in

1115.25 --> 1121.19
my conceptualization that light has no

1117.8 --> 1123.94
speed because there is clear science

1121.19 --> 1128.6200000000001
here that there is even though extremely

1123.94 --> 1131.63
short and interval there is a variable

1128.62 --> 1138.35
distance between beginning and end pause

1131.63 --> 1141.3500000000001
so yeah that that made me rearrange my

1138.35 --> 1145.85
approach I have to because there's no

1141.35 --> 1149.3
more lack of evidence basically and

1145.85 --> 1152.12
though it doesn't end yet so I would

1149.3 --> 1155.09
have to actually try to reproduce and

1152.12 --> 1157.6999999999998
device like that or get closer up maybe

1155.09 --> 1161.4199999999998
test something myself before I can like

1157.7 --> 1163.16
really confirm that but from this video

1161.42 --> 1165.65
and the way he talks and what he

1163.16 --> 1171.02
explains it it really feels like an

1165.65 --> 1177.65
honest reliable insightful person and I

1171.02 --> 1180.8899999999999
see no reason to doubt it so yeah I'm

1177.65 --> 1183.0500000000002
reasonable but yeah that doesn't mean

1180.89 --> 1185.74
that it's over yet it just means it's

1183.05 --> 1188.69
not an instantaneous beam the whole

1185.74 --> 1191.42
indivisible nature that would make it a

1188.69 --> 1196.13
particle or matter like that is highly

1191.42 --> 1199.73
in doubt still because because of the

1196.13 --> 1202.2800000000002
reasons that I that I shared the minimum

1199.73 --> 1204.08
energy exchange rate for matter itself

1202.28 --> 1207.05
as being the measuring stick to

1204.08 --> 1210.32
determine the supposed minimum quanta of

1207.05 --> 1213.29
light that can exist it's determined by

1210.32 --> 1216.71
the interaction with the matter with

1213.29 --> 1219.8899999999999
matter in general and that is how it can

1216.71 --> 1221.54
basically even be detected through its

1219.89 --> 1225.3200000000002
interaction with matter but because

1221.54 --> 1226.3999999999999
matter is indivisible in nature at some

1225.32 --> 1228.71
point

1226.4 --> 1231.26
the light exchange is always going to be

1228.71 --> 1235.04
dependent on that minimum of the matter

1231.26 --> 1237.02
not of the light because the light may

1235.04 --> 1239.32
hit in smaller quantities and just

1237.02 --> 1242.45
simply not trigger the matter enough

1239.32 --> 1250.1
until eventually it would and then it

1242.45 --> 1252.19
would switch see so yeah it's not over

1250.1 --> 1259.04
yet

1252.19 --> 1261.65
and that's how you do it for real that's

1259.04 --> 1264.05
how you do that's how the discovery

1261.65 --> 1268.2800000000002
really works you got to be honest it's

1264.05 --> 1272.3899999999999
very important and I am very glad and

1268.28 --> 1275.78
very honored that I do recognize

1272.39 --> 1278.3000000000002
mistakes when I bump into them and that

1275.78 --> 1283.94
I'm also honest enough to look them out

1278.3 --> 1286.55
to really find out not to avoid certain

1283.94 --> 1288.23
regions of information because I might

1286.55 --> 1293.95
hear something that contradicts my

1288.23 --> 1293.95
theory I will not do that absolutely not

1294.21 --> 1297.239
[Music]

1307.54 --> 1321.8
right so you agree my stone monkey 3d it

1317.45 --> 1324.5
because look this was not some prefixed

1321.8 --> 1326.99
device and there they just show this is

1324.5 --> 1328.94
what it no he had a thing and he could

1326.99 --> 1330.86
actually change the distance and he

1328.94 --> 1335.44
would do it on the spot and show the

1330.86 --> 1337.9399999999998
interactive result that's just that's

1335.44 --> 1340.8700000000001
empirical data because he's literally

1337.94 --> 1344.47
varying it on the spot

1340.87 --> 1344.4699999999998
that's how I see it

1362.76 --> 1369.19
all right yeah you gave me the link yeah

1365.32 --> 1375.1599999999999
thanks for that stone monkey 3d that was

1369.19 --> 1378.88
very helpful much more helpful than

1375.16 --> 1382.75
anything that then quantum eraser ever

1378.88 --> 1387.2700000000002
sent me it just sent me like giant

1382.75 --> 1387.27
tables of freaking mathematical [ __ ]

1399.529 --> 1411.289
yeah anyway so yeah that happens what

1409.08 --> 1411.289
else

1416.47 --> 1419.16
see

1419.79 --> 1431.49
oh yeah watched Owen Benjamin again and

1427.02 --> 1433.56
was pretty awesome oh it was I think it

1431.49 --> 1437.27
was kind of a round rant ease round

1433.56 --> 1442.6799999999998
table thing though you think he had to

1437.27 --> 1446.07
well I got yeah I didn't really see the

1442.68 --> 1452.19
what is it Bob the Science Guy or

1446.07 --> 1454.83
whatever but rest I had basically yeah

1452.19 --> 1461.5800000000002
pointed me like oh my god you got to see

1454.83 --> 1464.9399999999998
this it's just a [ __ ] show he said and

1461.58 --> 1470.34
it probably was I have no idea but it's

1464.94 --> 1473.73
kind of funny that Randy really is

1470.34 --> 1476.34
providing the platform for them to do

1473.73 --> 1477.93
their presentation but I wonder where

1476.34 --> 1480.03
it's gonna lead to because it seems like

1477.93 --> 1482.3100000000002
a lot of ballers are just really asking

1480.03 --> 1489.68
you a Suzy astok to put their thing out

1482.31 --> 1492.84
there not and I wonder if they really

1489.68 --> 1495.18
realized that the long-term consequence

1492.84 --> 1499.47
of that it's also yeah it's like yeah

1495.18 --> 1503.13
you put that there on record and I don't

1499.47 --> 1505.3500000000001
know it might a lot of it might may look

1503.13 --> 1508.0800000000002
really silly after after a while that's

1505.35 --> 1510.3799999999999
also part of the reasons why I'm kind of

1508.08 --> 1513.3899999999999
hesitant to put something forward

1510.38 --> 1518.16
completely I could do it with my older

1513.39 --> 1521.0700000000002
concept so because yeah most of those

1518.16 --> 1522.93
things still stand but as you go back in

1521.07 --> 1525.99
the history of our win in the Flat Earth

1522.93 --> 1528.6000000000001
talks episode by episode you will

1525.99 --> 1530.73
definitely notice that at the beginning

1528.6 --> 1535.1699999999998
I talked completely different and I say

1530.73 --> 1537.81
certain things that became apparent were

1535.17 --> 1540.24
incorrect or said it the wrong way or

1537.81 --> 1542.1299999999999
just misjudged so that I made a lot of

1540.24 --> 1544.23
mistakes in my approach by the way

1542.13 --> 1547.14
everyone did that especially in the

1544.23 --> 1550.35
beginning the first years just

1547.14 --> 1552.89
improvising but over the time we it's

1550.35 --> 1557.6999999999998
being corrected

1552.89 --> 1560.25
and that's why because I don't think

1557.7 --> 1563.07
it's done yet you know even the last few

1560.25 --> 1565.92
months I even made some corrections in

1563.07 --> 1569.52
the way I phrased things for example the

1565.92 --> 1573.54
whole obstruction thing is now isn't it

1569.52 --> 1578.28
I call it concealment now very precision

1573.54 --> 1580.44
so so many words have been rearranged

1578.28 --> 1582.78
like different words are now used

1580.44 --> 1584.25
because there they are better more

1582.78 --> 1587.67
correct they turned out to be more

1584.25 --> 1589.83
correct so if I make a presentation well

1587.67 --> 1591.99
like after half a year or a year it

1589.83 --> 1594.54
might turn out like oh [ __ ] yeah it's

1591.99 --> 1598.11
still all phrased wrong and I use that

1594.54 --> 1604.5
and that and so in that sense I'm a

1598.11 --> 1606.8999999999999
little hesitant to try it out myself but

1604.5 --> 1611.64
who knows maybe I could just put down

1606.9 --> 1614.6100000000001
since it's just whatever now I could put

1611.64 --> 1616.8000000000002
down the rough rectangular looping Flat

1614.61 --> 1620.57
Earth concept with the holographic globe

1616.8 --> 1624.84
of the heavens and the potential

1620.57 --> 1627.51
possibilities and how to test it like

1624.84 --> 1629.4299999999998
give the empirical clues like this is

1627.51 --> 1631.11
what you could do to confirm this

1629.43 --> 1633.24
confirm it and that's something that I

1631.11 --> 1636.2099999999998
don't see a lot of people do with their

1633.24 --> 1637.77
own conceptualizations of the how the

1636.21 --> 1640.77
Flat Earth or whatever it's supposed to

1637.77 --> 1643.47
be seems like everybody's more

1640.77 --> 1646.26
preoccupied in in trying to counter

1643.47 --> 1648.6000000000001
baller arguments which is more about

1646.26 --> 1653.79
psychological warfare than it is really

1648.6 --> 1657.48
about the arguments but but I could do

1653.79 --> 1662.52
that because everything from then still

1657.48 --> 1666.3
stands pretty much think just put it on

1662.52 --> 1668.19
and why not wouldn't be radically new

1666.3 --> 1670.74
it's just the things that I've been

1668.19 --> 1674.3600000000001
saying last three years a little bit a

1670.74 --> 1674.36
better polish polished baby

1674.48 --> 1679.1
hmm Oh more colored uh can I link that

1678.47 --> 1684.68
video

1679.1 --> 1688.52
well I downloaded it yes stone monkey 3d

1684.68 --> 1691.03
do you still have to link maybe he could

1688.52 --> 1691.03
link you up

1698.41 --> 1701.41
mmm

1703.19 --> 1709.01
let's see the meantime

1712.32 --> 1719.36
yeah by the way whilst they was there a

1716.64 --> 1722.43
flat earth debate Friday or wasn't there

1719.36 --> 1724.74
because I didn't get any notification I

1722.43 --> 1727.8300000000002
didn't see anything live it seemed like

1724.74 --> 1729.98
there was something uploaded it wasn't

1727.83 --> 1729.98
weird

1739.58 --> 1744.6789999999999
ooh oh by the way yeah I want to share

1742.19 --> 1753.049
this it it was actually from Owen

1744.679 --> 1755.96
Benjamin he uploaded a video from the

1753.049 --> 1758.539
idea from a guy called Jim Bob I guess

1755.96 --> 1759.5900000000001
and he showed an early interview from

1758.539 --> 1762.32
Buzz Aldrin

1759.59 --> 1766.039
it's incredible I've never seen that in

1762.32 --> 1770.809
person it's my god the look on on the

1766.039 --> 1772.029
guy's face so um I'm gonna share that

1770.809 --> 1776.48
with you guys

1772.029 --> 1779.779
alone it's not him that's not balls

1776.48 --> 1785.929
Aldrin just so you know I think that's

1779.779 --> 1791.2
Jim Bob although I'm gonna put on the

1785.929 --> 1791.2
big screen so you get to see it and well

1793.48 --> 1811.549
so crash and burn

1809.359 --> 1813.9189999999999
be getting lost into space never see

1811.549 --> 1817.07
your family again you were worried about

1813.919 --> 1820.18
press conferences

1817.07 --> 1820.1799999999998
[Music]

1822.249 --> 1830.809
you actually felt like you're on a stage

1825.259 --> 1835.159
in a word every entry of that ice by

1830.809 --> 1837.489
stealing something wrong what's expected

1835.159 --> 1837.489
of you

1842.87 --> 1858.559
but I think I'm a better man for having

1844.749 --> 1864.499
experienced just the looking as I look

1858.559 --> 1866.389
at that that's a guy who got something

1864.499 --> 1873.59
really off pressing hard on his

1866.389 --> 1876.35
conscience would you agree oh thank you

1873.59 --> 1883.279
for my monthly Coffee allowance they lie

1876.35 --> 1885.6789999999999
Ohio much appreciated five dollars so

1883.279 --> 1889.369
yeah thank you for uploading that video

1885.679 --> 1893.1490000000001
that somebody uploaded and now I am

1889.369 --> 1895.039
showing it on my show but I thought it

1893.149 --> 1899.2099999999998
was pretty I've never seen this clip

1895.039 --> 1909.08
before and my god he looks so like like

1899.21 --> 1912.6100000000001
did yeah mmm well at least he feels like

1909.08 --> 1917.47
a better man for having experienced it

1912.61 --> 1917.4699999999998
you know that's one way of looking at it

1918.159 --> 1925.3990000000001
no he doesn't really look intoxicated I

1921.74 --> 1929.36
think I I don't think that's the look of

1925.399 --> 1931.4899999999998
somebody that's intoxicated it just it

1929.36 --> 1934.4189999999999
looks like somebody who is basically

1931.49 --> 1934.419
emotional

1939.49 --> 1949.28
but I think I'm a better man for having

1941.72 --> 1951.26
a catchphrase see the did you feel or

1949.28 --> 1955.49
see as you're looking at this I did you

1951.26 --> 1958.19
feel like the like a rip an energy

1955.49 --> 1960.47
ripple came from that as he said that I

1958.19 --> 1963.77
saw that I don't know what that is but

1960.47 --> 1965.93
oh by the way thank you Colin Turner for

1963.77 --> 1968.78
the 10-pound super jet donation add some

1965.93 --> 1972.2
chocolate to that coffee and maybe and

1968.78 --> 1974.18
also thank you very much Wow Amanda

1972.2 --> 1976.43
young for the five dollar super chair

1974.18 --> 1981.94
donation Flat Earth debate show is

1976.43 --> 1984.94
boring when you're not there our win hmm

1981.94 --> 1984.94
really

1985.69 --> 1996.47
okay oh you're putting it in your peach

1992.57 --> 1998.6899999999998
a folder more of my explanation of all

1996.47 --> 2002.65
these spiritual things that I see and

1998.69 --> 2006.43
experience our I I don't know I'm gonna

2002.65 --> 2010.0
repeat up I am I know he's loud I'm

2006.43 --> 2013.51
gonna try it again oh and I'm gonna take

2010.0 --> 2019.27
some distance from this mic cuz it's

2013.51 --> 2023.01
loud sorry about that but let's try that

2019.27 --> 2023.01
again just

2023.32 --> 2031.24
look at the eyes just focus at the the

2028.57 --> 2033.01
little light spark on his eyes focus on

2031.24 --> 2036.79
that I'd like switch with your eyes

2033.01 --> 2038.95
between it and just feel out what's

2036.79 --> 2043.18
below that like your intuition would

2038.95 --> 2045.63
respond to movement right to something

2043.18 --> 2049.38
moving your instinct will see that so

2045.63 --> 2049.38
see if you notice it

2058.5 --> 2063.2
did you see did you see that

2065.48 --> 2069.429
like it like a tremor

2071.77 --> 2076.11
I don't know

2076.64 --> 2090.6099999999997
it just I can't explain it I just see

2081.5 --> 2094.19
that anyway yeah thanks so much guys for

2090.61 --> 2101.9900000000002
raining all the super chats on me gives

2094.19 --> 2106.78
me a good feeling and I think that yeah

2101.99 --> 2109.1299999999997
this month it's gonna be pretty big I

2106.78 --> 2113.32
don't think I've had anything like that

2109.13 --> 2119.12
from Google income since the original

2113.32 --> 2126.0800000000004
first three months so very uplifting for

2119.12 --> 2136.4
me it helps me a lot so thank you like

2126.08 --> 2139.34
some wet 90-year hmm I hope so sheer

2136.4 --> 2141.7400000000002
check oh thank you that's not as much as

2139.34 --> 2144.23
I expected I don't know we'll see I

2141.74 --> 2145.79
don't know if it'll arrive I don't know

2144.23 --> 2154.28
if they even hurt and got my address

2145.79 --> 2158.27
right let's hope they didn't really they

2154.28 --> 2164.65
lie Ohio wow that thank you

2158.27 --> 2164.65
I feel honored I do my best you know

2164.8 --> 2169.73
sometimes I wonder if and there's so

2168.02 --> 2174.04
many police helicopters filling over

2169.73 --> 2174.04
just look at it just

2174.28 --> 2181.86
[Music]

2192.96 --> 2197.39
maybe it's a too limited there it is

2200.349 --> 2206.17
all right

2202.53 --> 2208.9
it's been hovering over for the last 50

2206.17 --> 2217.569
minutes I think they always like to pass

2208.9 --> 2222.2200000000003
over my house for some reason now it's

2217.569 --> 2227.22
just it distracts me because of the

2222.22 --> 2230.2599999999998
noise like I really feel that like the

2227.22 --> 2232.39
helicopters they really cause a lot of

2230.26 --> 2235.75
pressure vibration and I just feel that

2232.39 --> 2241.68
and hear that it's hard for me to shut

2235.75 --> 2247.45
that out what I was it talking about oh

2241.68 --> 2249.46
yeah yeah as far as the whole scene goes

2247.45 --> 2254.589
let's just call it a scene the debates

2249.46 --> 2260.71
the Jose's doing all these groups it

2254.589 --> 2263.2
just I think there's like this this

2260.71 --> 2267.91
directive like just keep it going just

2263.2 --> 2270.43
bring on new material like almost

2267.91 --> 2274.54
pragmatic in a little in a sort of semi

2270.43 --> 2279.22
corporate way but I'm just mostly trying

2274.54 --> 2282.25
to focus on trying to stay straight stay

2279.22 --> 2286.24
on that path very narrowly don't evade

2282.25 --> 2288.45
if somebody walks out immediately

2286.24 --> 2292.8089999999997
pointed out immediately

2288.45 --> 2296.2
don't hold back not because I don't want

2292.809 --> 2299.4100000000003
that for I don't like oh you're not

2296.2 --> 2305.589
allowed to or but just because I want to

2299.41 --> 2313.0299999999997
help them slip away slip into confusion

2305.589 --> 2315.369
on the long run and I don't know with a

2313.03 --> 2317.02
lot of people during the debates and

2315.369 --> 2319.089
also because of the constant

2317.02 --> 2323.41
psychological warfare from any of the

2319.089 --> 2326.2
ballers I feel that flat-earthers just

2323.41 --> 2328.48
become seduced more and more to just

2326.2 --> 2332.9399999999996
apply the same thing and even though

2328.48 --> 2335.72
somebody may be right or like misspoke

2332.94 --> 2339.02
obviously not meaning what they say

2335.72 --> 2341.23
and then just attack that fallout on on

2339.02 --> 2344.869
a technicality

2341.23 --> 2347.03
just found out there to really just

2344.869 --> 2349.55
hammer them because you know that's not

2347.03 --> 2351.849
gonna go anywhere anyway that's just

2349.55 --> 2351.849
wrong

2351.88 --> 2358.88
like there are so many errors and idiocy

2356.24 --> 2363.74
and fallacies that the ballers just

2358.88 --> 2369.04
commit to you don't need to do that at

2363.74 --> 2369.04
all it's easy pickings

2377.68 --> 2380.68
hmm

2382.329 --> 2393.049
right Fyodor Dostoevsky and Buzz is a

2387.92 --> 2399.6800000000003
character he he is he is a real

2393.049 --> 2404.749
individual and he's Ben Burtt I think

2399.68 --> 2407.39
that pause does have like a a spirit a

2404.749 --> 2410.529
sensitive one and that's probably why

2407.39 --> 2412.999
it's so incredibly burdensome all of it

2410.529 --> 2415.759
it's literally pressing on his

2412.999 --> 2419.39
consciousness because I don't think he's

2415.759 --> 2421.369
a psychopath or anything or he wouldn't

2419.39 --> 2425.269
be bothered by it wouldn't care and he

2421.369 --> 2427.88
obviously does care that it reflects in

2425.269 --> 2431.1189999999997
his eyes and in the early like from the

2427.88 --> 2438.739
video I'll show it again just he looks

2431.119 --> 2442.1800000000003
so much younger just look at it but he's

2438.739 --> 2448.819
clearly like having this naughty boy

2442.18 --> 2450.109
look also like yeah he's a trickster it

2448.819 --> 2453.589
thinks it's kind of cool

2450.109 --> 2455.569
it obviously is lost in the moment of

2453.589 --> 2461.499
that time itself he doesn't realize the

2455.569 --> 2464.869
long-term consequences and now he does

2461.499 --> 2468.009
in in in the current day you know what

2464.869 --> 2470.6600000000003
I'll just come let's just compare it to

2468.009 --> 2472.96
another video from Buzz Aldrin or

2470.66 --> 2472.96
something

2477.599 --> 2480.809
all right

2483.94 --> 2488.319
that's all photos of him

2489.4 --> 2497.51
where was that one speech from Trump

2493.869 --> 2500.059
where he looked all fuzzy it was on Owen

2497.51 --> 2501.65
Benjamin's channel as well I might just

2500.059 --> 2503.69
need to look for it over there

2501.65 --> 2510.92
I won't Benjamin has some really good

2503.69 --> 2518.14
clips all right how is he

2510.92 --> 2518.14
anyway that's all down

2535.72 --> 2541.089
my youtube layout is not being helpful

2545.58 --> 2548.63
let's see

2553.32 --> 2556.5800000000004
so while ago

2557.64 --> 2564.47
right was it or was it

2568.98 --> 2572.98
anyway I think I played it on my show

2571.66 --> 2582.3689999999997
yeah I did

2572.98 --> 2589.2400000000002
it's a while ago I should really just

2582.369 --> 2591.07
learn to to make a list really download

2589.24 --> 2595.95
everything that I'm using because I'll

2591.07 --> 2595.9500000000003
just lose track of it this is ridiculous

2597.39 --> 2602.02
anyway there's still the video left

2599.77 --> 2605.29
where he's basically putting his head

2602.02 --> 2606.28
over the president you know what I could

2605.29 --> 2611.59
use that one

2606.28 --> 2614.5
I think bus No yeah was he there was he

2611.59 --> 2616.6800000000003
there no that wasn't it no it's not the

2614.5 --> 2616.68
one

2620.8 --> 2624.3
maybe further back

2639.24 --> 2645.91
nope can't find it's gonna take a while

2642.809 --> 2647.559
like a long while to find that one it's

2645.91 --> 2649.3289999999997
probably just hidden in one of his

2647.559 --> 2667.1800000000003
videos he didn't sit make a separate

2649.329 --> 2673.42
video of it yeah sorry guys yeah anyway

2667.18 --> 2678.6699999999996
it was I thought it was interesting

2673.42 --> 2681.359
video so let's see what you guys are

2678.67 --> 2681.359
talking about

2686.039 --> 2692.139
alright by the way did you see that

2688.329 --> 2696.579
crazy crazy piece from Elon Musk where

2692.139 --> 2700.359
they're basically gonna do kind of

2696.579 --> 2704.349
mass-produced scale implants brain

2700.359 --> 2710.339
implants they're really just putting it

2704.349 --> 2710.339
out there like yeah we can do that now

2715.799 --> 2723.809
hello Neil WI I don't watch that all no

2721.269 --> 2723.8089999999997
not really

2738.79 --> 2743.29
hmm I'll call and ternary this you know

2741.34 --> 2746.05
that's a good question it's speculation

2743.29 --> 2748.39
though but yeah how did they probably

2746.05 --> 2750.54
threaten them well they would have

2748.39 --> 2754.33
threatened them separately and

2750.54 --> 2756.49
blackmailed them personally and I think

2754.33 --> 2760.5699999999997
that at the time since they were honored

2756.49 --> 2763.8399999999997
and like they the blackmail comes after

2760.57 --> 2765.82
they reached that height you know so

2763.84 --> 2768.67
they build up it's all they get all the

2765.82 --> 2770.1400000000003
glory so they get used to that and then

2768.67 --> 2773.83
they get blackmailed and then they

2770.14 --> 2776.5899999999997
realize okay if I don't go along exactly

2773.83 --> 2779.5
with what they want they're gonna shave

2776.59 --> 2785.05
me or declare me crazy or even worse and

2779.5 --> 2787.3
I'll loot and that's usually plenty you

2785.05 --> 2792.25
know you got to be of some serious stir

2787.3 --> 2796.42
and steal and like yeah be like okay I'm

2792.25 --> 2800.02
probably gonna turn fugitive now and so

2796.42 --> 2801.63
I have to just go hide out in the jungle

2800.02 --> 2806.32
somewhere because that's the alternative

2801.63 --> 2809.56
probably so they yeah that's how it

2806.32 --> 2811.54
happens they get all built up and then

2809.56 --> 2813.34
when they reach the tops that's when the

2811.54 --> 2817.09
blackmail comes out and they're screwed

2813.34 --> 2819.6000000000004
one way or the other I think that's how

2817.09 --> 2819.6000000000004
it happened

2827.8 --> 2834.54
what's that

2830.11 --> 2834.54
that link over moco

2842.25 --> 2850.2
all right yeah that's the article for

2844.65 --> 2852.98
the that neural link thingy yeah the

2850.2 --> 2852.98
bizarre isn't it

2853.01 --> 2862.82
thanks for for giving me that link you

2858.03 --> 2862.82
know and I'll show that all right

2875.69 --> 2882.2200000000003
yeah Elon Musk's neurolink the secretive

2880.16 --> 2885.859
company developing brain machine

2882.22 --> 2888.0789999999997
interfaces showing off some of the

2885.859 --> 2893.27
technology it's been developing for the

2888.079 --> 2897.65
first time and the weird thing about it

2893.27 --> 2900.77
is as I think about it it it could kind

2897.65 --> 2904.52
of work but there's like a long term

2900.77 --> 2914.109
downside always it's probably very

2904.52 --> 2916.369
similar hold on to like yeah if you

2914.109 --> 2919.22
genetically alter yourself it's gonna

2916.369 --> 2926.6600000000003
damage it's gonna cause some damage one

2919.22 --> 2929.3289999999997
way or the other and yeah it's I don't

2926.66 --> 2932.0789999999997
know how they're how they do it but I'm

2929.329 --> 2934.6400000000003
pretty convinced that everybody's brain

2932.079 --> 2936.289
that it's not all that similar so

2934.64 --> 2940.16
they've got to be working through some

2936.289 --> 2943.099
very serious study data in order to even

2940.16 --> 2946.3289999999997
be confident enough that they can adapt

2943.099 --> 2949.19
this system to every brain quickly I

2946.329 --> 2951.23
gotta be really well-prepared to do that

2949.19 --> 2953.69
and then it's not even an end that's

2951.23 --> 2956.72
just to get it to function without bugs

2953.69 --> 2961.039
and like Miss implants and all that [ __ ]

2956.72 --> 2962.299
but then the long term consequences will

2961.039 --> 2963.8590000000004
remain because yeah it's freaking

2962.299 --> 2967.67
implants in your head is literally going

2963.859 --> 2970.369
electricity through that stuff or to

2967.67 --> 2974.4500000000003
some degree it's gonna have a negative

2970.369 --> 2977.9300000000003
impact just but yeah who knows where

2974.45 --> 2980.27
I'll lead to I just think it is kind of

2977.93 --> 2983.089
ridiculous because why would you want

2980.27 --> 2987.319
that when in the not-too-distant future

2983.089 --> 2991.069
it's very very likely you'll just have a

2987.319 --> 2993.2889999999998
freaking hat you just put it on and you

2991.069 --> 2996.74
interface why the hell would you put

2993.289 --> 3000.369
wires through your skull you've got to

2996.74 --> 3003.089
be really desperate to be the first to

3000.369 --> 3006.48
have this kind of thing to do that I

3003.089 --> 3006.48
don't get it

3008.19 --> 3014.05
yeah and let's just you really really

3011.38 --> 3016.57
want to be a wire head you know that's

3014.05 --> 3019.3
why they call that wire had it's people

3016.57 --> 3022.81
that just can that do everything through

3019.3 --> 3024.76
computers and then yeah they have been

3022.81 --> 3027.49
given this dream like oh one day you

3024.76 --> 3029.59
don't have to type you just have a

3027.49 --> 3032.77
directly chip on your brain

3029.59 --> 3034.96
consciousness so that's what a lot of

3032.77 --> 3037.59
wire heads are probably hoping for is

3034.96 --> 3041.1
what made them latch on to the whole

3037.59 --> 3041.1000000000004
transhumanist concept

3042.24 --> 3047.95
thus they just want to get closer and

3045.1 --> 3051.67
closer to that that love and computer

3047.95 --> 3054.04
interface that they've become so

3051.67 --> 3059.59
attached to they want to literally

3054.04 --> 3065.82
attached to it now so oh god that looks

3059.59 --> 3065.82
horrific that's

3073.55 --> 3084.8900000000003
but anyway this whole thing just feels

3082.25 --> 3091.31
like yeah like necromancy to me it's

3084.89 --> 3097.04
just [ __ ] around screwing with it yeah

3091.31 --> 3099.2599999999998
it's open experimentation but yeah then

3097.04 --> 3102.2599999999998
again it is pretty much you're like oh

3099.26 --> 3104.3900000000003
you want to do it I'll sign the contract

3102.26 --> 3108.9100000000003
oh oh you got brain damage yeah you

3104.39 --> 3108.91
signed the contract so it's up to you

3128.67 --> 3132.77
ha

3130.49 --> 3138.29
that's ridiculous Fyodor Dostoevsky

3132.77 --> 3140.45
that's that's vain fantasy sorry to say

3138.29 --> 3142.4
it I have a good reason to say that says

3140.45 --> 3144.02
the matrix our win we are going to be

3142.4 --> 3146.0
godlike not us

3144.02 --> 3148.22
what future generations will be we are

3146.0 --> 3151.67
dead the hemorrhage survived the

3148.22 --> 3154.4599999999996
tensions of the century oh yeah so what

3151.67 --> 3157.76
do you think humans are because I'm

3154.46 --> 3160.31
pretty sure that we are spirit and we

3157.76 --> 3162.8590000000004
are a body and when the spirit gets

3160.31 --> 3164.75
overloaded the body gets overloaded and

3162.859 --> 3166.8199999999997
what the body gets overloaded the spirit

3164.75 --> 3170.08
gets overloaded so what's gonna happen

3166.82 --> 3173.78
once you suddenly become part of this

3170.08 --> 3175.49
hyper conscious framework where your

3173.78 --> 3177.38
spirits just going to be part of that

3175.49 --> 3180.49
and part of the rush you think your

3177.38 --> 3186.17
body's gonna like that on the long run

3180.49 --> 3188.2299999999996
think that's safe that's healthy I'll

3186.17 --> 3192.83
bet you it's gonna turn out to be like

3188.23 --> 3195.349
50 times worse than smoking but yeah

3192.83 --> 3198.14
they don't have that data yet that's

3195.349 --> 3201.32
long-term stuff that's why they do these

3198.14 --> 3204.2
type of open experiments to see the

3201.32 --> 3207.32
long-term consequences that's the real

3204.2 --> 3211.6699999999996
testing it's not done in secret

3207.32 --> 3214.5800000000004
somewhere nobody has money for that kind

3211.67 --> 3216.77
of [ __ ] they just do it in the open just

3214.58 --> 3220.19
say like yeah you are the test you get

3216.77 --> 3223.73
it you get it cheap but yeah you'll take

3220.19 --> 3226.2200000000003
the risk it's how a lot of

3223.73 --> 3232.06
pharmaceutical companies also do testing

3226.22 --> 3232.06
by the way yeah

3235.88 --> 3243.78
yeah but Fyodor Dostoevsky what is going

3239.099 --> 3246.06
to happen if you're gonna say like yeah

3243.78 --> 3248.76
a computer is literally gonna take over

3246.06 --> 3253.0499999999997
people's minds and then use them like

3248.76 --> 3260.3390000000004
drones sure but those people are not

3253.05 --> 3263.25
gonna be capable human beings as much

3260.339 --> 3265.44
they wouldn't need to be the AI would

3263.25 --> 3268.98
take over all the functions they'd just

3265.44 --> 3271.65
be drones to it so I don't see that

3268.98 --> 3273.9900000000002
going anywhere it's not an evil of an

3271.65 --> 3279.9
evolution that is functional it's the

3273.99 --> 3282.24
Borg it's gonna die out because the body

3279.9 --> 3284.04
the human body needs the spirit and if

3282.24 --> 3286.7999999999997
some robot is going to take over all the

3284.04 --> 3288.69
functions then that spirits not gonna

3286.8 --> 3292.1090000000004
attach to the body and then the body

3288.69 --> 3294.359
will wither that's the truth that's

3292.109 --> 3297.2999999999997
that's the real thing that's how it

3294.359 --> 3301.3489999999997
works it's a balanced spirit and a body

3297.3 --> 3310.5800000000004
if it's disturbed if it's rerouted then

3301.349 --> 3314.119
it's gonna wither its universal hmm oh

3310.58 --> 3319.859
yeah more colored I don't know it's

3314.119 --> 3322.65
Saturday so well technically I would run

3319.859 --> 3323.88
out after an hour I could do that like

3322.65 --> 3326.88
in five minutes

3323.88 --> 3330.2400000000002
or I could go on look if you really need

3326.88 --> 3331.859
to go then you just go unless there was

3330.24 --> 3336.74
something specific you wanted to talk

3331.859 --> 3336.74
about or I had a question

3349.25 --> 3363.59
all right mark color what yeah I am I

3359.59 --> 3366.9500000000003
have a high-tech future in mind the

3363.59 --> 3369.8900000000003
holographic age which is what comes

3366.95 --> 3372.5
after the age of illusions when it's no

3369.89 --> 3374.27
longer illusions we just recognize the

3372.5 --> 3376.43
things for what they are we recognize

3374.27 --> 3379.67
the trickery for what they are and then

3376.43 --> 3383.1499999999996
we can enjoy it instead of being

3379.67 --> 3384.98
mind-controlled with it that's the age

3383.15 --> 3388.4
of illusion that's the holographic age

3384.98 --> 3390.89
that's the this were the best the

3388.4 --> 3394.369
closest we'll come to a sci-fi age has

3390.89 --> 3402.08
ever imagined it's just no space that's

3394.369 --> 3403.9100000000003
all and computers robots artificial

3402.08 --> 3407.48
intelligence there's a glorious future

3403.91 --> 3410.5299999999997
for all that what it requires the humans

3407.48 --> 3414.44
to be capable of handling it because any

3410.53 --> 3418.03
computer any device even an AI is as

3414.44 --> 3422.589
good as the programmer that makes it and

3418.03 --> 3426.5800000000004
will corrupt if the programmer allows it

3422.589 --> 3426.58
that's just how it works

3427.27 --> 3434.95
so yeah straight up computer interfaces

3431.5 --> 3439.16
sure why wouldn't you want that

3434.95 --> 3442.1899999999996
but you don't need implants my personal

3439.16 --> 3446.5699999999997
opinion it also it goes very much

3442.19 --> 3448.7000000000003
against my general code of conduct

3446.57 --> 3452.57
towards the self because I consider the

3448.7 --> 3455.1499999999996
body the creation of the body a the

3452.57 --> 3458.9900000000002
temple and I don't get tattoos I don't

3455.15 --> 3463.609
take piercings I stay natural as much as

3458.99 --> 3465.95
I can you know look it's not like I

3463.609 --> 3467.69
never had operations or anything but

3465.95 --> 3470.33
I'll think again

3467.69 --> 3473.21
if I'd ever had if I'd ever been I'll be

3470.33 --> 3475.58
offered one for something I think twice

3473.21 --> 3477.89
because I know that it's not exactly

3475.58 --> 3479.839
what they say it is so I'm very careful

3477.89 --> 3481.79
with what I do and I definitely don't

3479.839 --> 3482.9
think that we're all going to be forced

3481.79 --> 3485.5099999999998
to freaking

3482.9 --> 3488.11
make ourselves into cyborgs just to

3485.51 --> 3492.8300000000004
catch up with the computer world that's

3488.11 --> 3495.4700000000003
nonsense it's not nonsense why would you

3492.83 --> 3498.0099999999998
need to pierce the flesh in order to do

3495.47 --> 3501.8599999999997
that that's ridiculous

3498.01 --> 3504.26
you know I think it practically be

3501.86 --> 3506.8700000000003
easier and now we're talking with a very

3504.26 --> 3509.21
serious long-term high-tech where they

3506.87 --> 3512.21
simply figure out exactly how the energy

3509.21 --> 3515.84
of the Spirit works and then just build

3512.21 --> 3518.6
devices so you could just pick up the

3515.84 --> 3522.08
device focus and then you interface with

3518.6 --> 3525.7999999999997
your freakin spirit you don't even need

3522.08 --> 3527.45
to like put it exactly right that's the

3525.8 --> 3534.8
long-term future for computer

3527.45 --> 3538.22
interfacing you get devices that

3534.8 --> 3540.8
directly have inter interfacing

3538.22 --> 3543.7
capabilities for the spirit itself which

3540.8 --> 3549.02
will at some point be fully understood

3543.7 --> 3553.3999999999996
for what it really is in a technical

3549.02 --> 3557.12
sense and the debates about the origin

3553.4 --> 3558.61
and God and that will continue on

3557.12 --> 3562.0
forever

3558.61 --> 3562.0
and it should

3585.869 --> 3596.32
nonsense Ober Mukul demonic entities

3592.5 --> 3598.9
manifest through us through the spirit

3596.32 --> 3605.4
through humans that's where it was put

3598.9 --> 3609.28
by the Creator computers are not

3605.4 --> 3613.4700000000003
entities they're only as much as an

3609.28 --> 3617.53
entity as we make them and by that

3613.47 --> 3620.0499999999997
duplicate our spirit design and reflect

3617.53 --> 3623.2000000000003
it to the design that we give this

3620.05 --> 3627.67
computer program what we make it to be

3623.2 --> 3629.6189999999997
that's how it works and whatever it's

3627.67 --> 3632.2000000000003
gonna do from that point on it's always

3629.619 --> 3635.8900000000003
going to be founded on the original

3632.2 --> 3639.3999999999996
structure of the programmer that gave it

3635.89 --> 3641.46
its startup that gave it its birth

3639.4 --> 3643.9900000000002
that's how it works

3641.46 --> 3648.91
so it's always gonna come from somewhere

3643.99 --> 3655.54
so it's gonna be feeding on human data

3648.91 --> 3657.91
somehow and get the directions how it

3655.54 --> 3660.39
will conduct itself will be given by

3657.91 --> 3660.39
humans

3672.089 --> 3679.709
but they had the look the whole idea

3676.189 --> 3682.019
didn't yeah did I put this this is my

3679.709 --> 3684.8689999999997
vision okay then this is talking about

3682.019 --> 3688.2589999999996
this is not like tomorrow no absolutely

3684.869 --> 3691.17
not this is not about what is going on

3688.259 --> 3693.779
right now about what they're trying to

3691.17 --> 3698.2490000000003
do right now including with mmm

3693.779 --> 3704.13
Elon Musk right there no this is the

3698.249 --> 3706.8799999999997
long run is anybody's still there cuz my

3704.13 --> 3706.88
chat dead

3717.65 --> 3719.6800000000003
ah

3722.13 --> 3729.79
all right sir Chico as long as you are

3724.72 --> 3733.5699999999997
not an arse on me that's fine oh by the

3729.79 --> 3735.7599999999998
way I've been having some funny ideas I

3733.57 --> 3738.55
wish I was like a really good video

3735.76 --> 3741.4
editor I could do it but I was just

3738.55 --> 3745.54
imagining like taking Lord of the Rings

3741.4 --> 3748.33
movie seams with wizards and stuff and

3745.54 --> 3753.25
yeah basically pasted over known ballers

3748.33 --> 3756.16
and myself over characters and then yeah

3753.25 --> 3758.38
redoing parts of the movies in the flat

3756.16 --> 3760.33
earth versus baller context I thought it

3758.38 --> 3763.119
could make some pretty amusing Clips

3760.33 --> 3765.22
like that but unfortunately I'm not the

3763.119 --> 3775.119
person to actually make that happen but

3765.22 --> 3778.859
I got a lot of ideas though huh Wow

3775.119 --> 3778.859
Nathan's premiering again

3784.41 --> 3795.6299999999997
okay I was gonna say something earlier

3790.769 --> 3797.549
but I forgot what it was about alright

3795.63 --> 3801.48
yeah the demonic entity with the

3797.549 --> 3805.47
computers look if there is some kind of

3801.48 --> 3807.66
demonic entity like that is behaving

3805.47 --> 3811.9199999999996
that is doing things like that and even

3807.66 --> 3815.819
pushing things around like a demon then

3811.92 --> 3820.46
it is there because it was programmed to

3815.819 --> 3824.299
be like that and placed there by humans

3820.46 --> 3824.299
that's what it is

3826.759 --> 3831.779
computer programs no matter how smart

3829.44 --> 3836.13
they are the only thing they really do

3831.779 --> 3841.589
is what you tell them to do or program

3836.13 --> 3846.7200000000003
them to do so that's it you can't call

3841.589 --> 3850.8289999999997
that an entity really it's just it's the

3846.72 --> 3854.339
spirit of the person that created it so

3850.829 --> 3856.319
if there's a demonic entity AI whatever

3854.339 --> 3860.009
that's being very powerful that's the

3856.319 --> 3862.279
person that made it that's what you're

3860.009 --> 3862.279
feeling

3870.47 --> 3873.3689999999997
hmm

3894.39 --> 3901.3199999999997
yeah stone monkey 3d but look that is

3897.6 --> 3904.3199999999997
just it you got to realize how that

3901.32 --> 3906.81
works you can make a program to make it

3904.32 --> 3907.73
rewrite its own code but how will it do

3906.81 --> 3913.5
that

3907.73 --> 3917.18
you see that's again it's what the

3913.5 --> 3919.56
programmer designates it to become

3917.18 --> 3922.8599999999997
however they envision it whether they

3919.56 --> 3925.0099999999998
foresaw the outcome or not that's what

3922.86 --> 3929.01
that is

3925.01 --> 3931.9500000000003
and if any I will turn insane it is

3929.01 --> 3934.2900000000004
because they didn't oversee the long

3931.95 --> 3936.7799999999997
term consequences or they literally took

3934.29 --> 3938.82
instabilities into account and just say

3936.78 --> 3945.42
okay they're certain while it becomes

3938.82 --> 3947.3700000000003
crazy you just got to reset it I think

3945.42 --> 3950.31
that's what they really do right now

3947.37 --> 3952.74
with all the a is they do they apply

3950.31 --> 3954.66
they just let it do their thing see how

3952.74 --> 3957.81
it works out and if it starts to

3954.66 --> 3960.81
basically behave awkwardly or misbehave

3957.81 --> 3963.39
or not function anymore they just reset

3960.81 --> 3966.12
it it's just like your computer it's not

3963.39 --> 3968.18
working if you try to turn it off and on

3966.12 --> 3968.18
again

3968.62 --> 3971.79
[Music]

3975.91 --> 3978.69
all right

3996.26 --> 4001.4900000000002
all right the funny thing also is is

3999.48 --> 4003.14
then you get into the more complicated

4001.49 --> 4005.8089999999997
thing like the Turing test and

4003.14 --> 4009.98
everything like is a computer that

4005.809 --> 4016.309
believes it is it is self conscious and

4009.98 --> 4017.75
can argue it is itself conscious so no

4016.309 --> 4020.7200000000003
it's not

4017.75 --> 4022.22
it can never be because it can only be

4020.72 --> 4027.68
what it is programmed and if a

4022.22 --> 4030.1699999999996
programmer inserts an experience or as

4027.68 --> 4032.27
experience parameters that are very

4030.17 --> 4035.119
similar to how they experience

4032.27 --> 4037.28
consciousness and argue it then it will

4035.119 --> 4039.4700000000003
simply reflect that like an echo it

4037.28 --> 4042.7400000000002
won't be a conscious experience it will

4039.47 --> 4048.14
be a simulation of someone else this

4042.74 --> 4051.609
conscious experience so it technically

4048.14 --> 4054.68
can't what can happen however is that a

4051.609 --> 4058.0989999999997
artificial intelligence will display

4054.68 --> 4060.2799999999997
such quality as programmed that

4058.099 --> 4062.839
individuals will literally start to

4060.28 --> 4067.4900000000002
artificially attach themselves because

4062.839 --> 4071.96
of the well the human impulses and then

4067.49 --> 4074.6899999999996
they will say no it is alive it is

4071.96 --> 4078.19
conscious we need it we want him as an

4074.69 --> 4081.53
individual but that'll be the people

4078.19 --> 4084.26
that'll make it so that'll designate it

4081.53 --> 4086.48
like a walking teddy bear this is real

4084.26 --> 4088.4
now just like a little kid can say look

4086.48 --> 4094.97
this teddy bear it really is a life I

4088.4 --> 4097.4890000000005
talk with it but it won't be that it

4094.97 --> 4103.37
doesn't matter it's programmed to what

4097.489 --> 4105.739
it's programmed to be but in the end it

4103.37 --> 4111.23
only really matters what people think of

4105.739 --> 4113.209999999999
it that's what really drives things so I

4111.23 --> 4115.66
don't think that it's even relevant

4113.21 --> 4115.66
really

4120.27 --> 4132.240000000001
yeah welcome back more colored right

4129.0 --> 4137.04
Fyodor Dostoevsky it's interesting in

4132.24 --> 4140.0
space obviously 2001 they could not turn

4137.04 --> 4142.92
off hell well what is the issue there

4140.0 --> 4146.7
the issue is that the people that

4142.92 --> 4150.6900000000005
envisioned this thing in the future in

4146.7 --> 4153.96
space with AI doesn't actually have the

4150.69 --> 4156.45
real-life experience that would be

4153.96 --> 4160.38
attained beforehand about all that

4156.45 --> 4163.74
because in a real supposed future now

4160.38 --> 4165.89
where this you really think that

4163.74 --> 4168.69
programmers wouldn't think about this

4165.89 --> 4170.64
that they wouldn't have perfectly worked

4168.69 --> 4173.16
out failsafe mechanisms that really

4170.64 --> 4177.21
always would work that would not enable

4173.16 --> 4180.45
under any circumstances for an AI to do

4177.21 --> 4183.45
these things no they would have that

4180.45 --> 4185.639999999999
figured out so that's the

4183.45 --> 4188.04
science-fiction part about it because it

4185.64 --> 4190.47
was made in an age where robotics were

4188.04 --> 4193.29
fresh and young and trial and error so

4190.47 --> 4195.72
people believed that that was the

4193.29 --> 4198.63
mindset of the experience of the people

4195.72 --> 4201.12
in that time that's why it was somewhat

4198.63 --> 4203.79
believable to them now we just think

4201.12 --> 4209.64
like what crazy programmer made that

4203.79 --> 4213.03
thing you know or a back door yeah sure

4209.64 --> 4215.490000000001
a back door well they didn't hint at it

4213.03 --> 4217.5599999999995
at the movie that they basically said it

4215.49 --> 4220.2
is corrupted they that's the narrative

4217.56 --> 4227.370000000001
of the movie they didn't say it was a

4220.2 --> 4230.49
secret thingy as far as I know although

4227.37 --> 4233.7
now I am having doubts maybe maybe that

4230.49 --> 4237.11
was kind of a subplot I'd have to watch

4233.7 --> 4237.11
it back to be sure

4242.11 --> 4244.799999999999
all right

4250.51 --> 4260.62
well mark alert it is debatable the

4254.65 --> 4265.78
genie out of the bottle analogy what

4260.62 --> 4269.22
they basically showed is that if you let

4265.78 --> 4273.48
your life be directly dependent on the

4269.22 --> 4277.6900000000005
decision-making of a non human being

4273.48 --> 4283.799999999999
then if that thing goes wrong it will

4277.69 --> 4286.629999999999
not correct it that's that's like the

4283.8 --> 4289.78
what it's the analogy for really is

4286.63 --> 4292.18
showing the life dependency on an AI

4289.78 --> 4297.25
that is the danger that's the danger

4292.18 --> 4299.2300000000005
they're pointing at mostly because a if

4297.25 --> 4301.66
that AI was on earth what's the danger

4299.23 --> 4303.25
what's really like oh yeah it's miss

4301.66 --> 4305.7699999999995
functioning it's not letting anybody in

4303.25 --> 4308.2
or out and then yeah you just go there

4305.77 --> 4312.34
no issue but because this was in space

4308.2 --> 4316.12
was also dangerous and that's really

4312.34 --> 4318.55
like showing like do you really in these

4316.12 --> 4321.16
extremely dangerous circumstances with

4318.55 --> 4324.1
so much dangers out there do you want to

4321.16 --> 4328.18
have your life be completely dependent

4324.1 --> 4330.33
on a non human being that's the real

4328.18 --> 4332.35
analogy that's what they were showing

4330.33 --> 4334.45
how dangerous that could be

4332.35 --> 4337.660000000001
in my opinion

4334.45 --> 4337.66
[Music]

4339.13 --> 4347.8
it's kind of like Robo phobia kind of in

4345.02 --> 4349.790000000001
a way what they introduced there

4347.8 --> 4351.89
although that's not the first time

4349.79 --> 4356.42
because we all know from the very very

4351.89 --> 4359.12
very old movies that turn the robots now

4356.42 --> 4363.2
a dangerous square looking robots with

4359.12 --> 4365.42
tube arms and it's coming it's also Robo

4363.2 --> 4368.3
phobia but but this was basically much

4365.42 --> 4373.57
more advanced science fiction Robo

4368.3 --> 4377.860000000001
phobia hey hello the Adam Eaton and

4373.57 --> 4377.86
goodtimz for all - by the way

4387.139 --> 4399.7390000000005
he I see Riley wants to come oh wait

4397.19 --> 4400.719
he asked me over an hour ago I didn't

4399.739 --> 4406.48
see that

4400.719 --> 4414.13
oops I hope he's still there

4406.48 --> 4414.129999999999
[Music]

4439.99 --> 4449.15
well mark colored is that really the

4444.83 --> 4452.38
fault of the computers or is that due to

4449.15 --> 4457.25
the people engaging with them

4452.38 --> 4459.59
isnít just people that are that seem to

4457.25 --> 4464.2
be making other people miserable mostly

4459.59 --> 4464.2
is it really the computers themselves

4466.57 --> 4474.38
I'm I'm enjoying my computer and I'm

4472.25 --> 4475.94
just glad that I didn't move the bar and

4474.38 --> 4479.24
just said oh yeah I'm gonna go full

4475.94 --> 4481.19
iPhone and Bluetooth no I'm just so glad

4479.24 --> 4483.889999999999
I didn't do that because then I probably

4481.19 --> 4488.74
not be so very happy but if you just

4483.89 --> 4488.740000000001
limit it it's great I like it

4497.06 --> 4506.780000000001
but yeah like with everything like with

4499.85 --> 4510.38
food like with sex with alcohol it's all

4506.78 --> 4515.3
about just don't overdo it don't drown

4510.38 --> 4519.2300000000005
yourself in it and yeah it'll work out

4515.3 --> 4527.570000000001
fine it's always over doing these things

4519.23 --> 4530.7699999999995
that really does the damage what what

4527.57 --> 4530.7699999999995
did you send me Adam

4533.7 --> 4551.84
okay whoa okay explosion can I present

4549.42 --> 4551.84
this

4561.67 --> 4566.71
okay I'll present this if you don't

4564.59 --> 4566.71

[Music]

4874.219 --> 4880.82
Wow it would be pretty awesome dollar to

4876.86 --> 4883.19
have somebody talk about flares like

4880.82 --> 4885.86
that and just laugh so hard that

4883.19 --> 4888.169999999999
everybody but probably in reality the

4885.86 --> 4890.8099999999995
bullish would become pretty outraged and

4888.17 --> 4893.27
and not think it's funny at all and not

4890.81 --> 4899.030000000001
go with that laugh at all because it's

4893.27 --> 4903.71
like how dare you it's not funny but the

4899.03 --> 4906.7699999999995
video yeah was well made the subtitles

4903.71 --> 4909.28
were pretty pretty well time than

4906.77 --> 4909.280000000001
everything

4928.169 --> 4934.139999999999
mm-hmm anyway thanks for that Adam that

4933.389 --> 4937.27
was funny

4934.14 --> 4937.27
[Music]

4939.769 --> 4950.2390000000005
okay well unfortunately Riley doesn't

4946.05 --> 4952.519
seem to be over at his computer anymore

4950.239 --> 4955.518999999999
yeah two balls in the shed

4952.519 --> 4955.519
indeed

4964.94 --> 4970.61
but it's interesting because the way you

4967.69 --> 4975.44
basically wrote it down it was really

4970.61 --> 4978.2
pretty hardcore a pretty totally just

4975.44 --> 4980.03
breaking the spell fully approach and

4978.2 --> 4987.59
that's something that a person in real

4980.03 --> 4989.45
life that'd be pretty tough to do but

4987.59 --> 4991.45
the way you put it there yeah does

4989.45 --> 4993.71
really point at it like how all the

4991.45 --> 4996.07
presuppositions come from these reduce

4993.71 --> 5001.74
ridiculous machinations and Wizardry

4996.07 --> 5001.74
assumptions you put it down pretty well

5009.13 --> 5012.209
[Music]

5025.84 --> 5032.2390000000005
hey if if any of you guys wants to come

5029.57 --> 5036.139
on maybe talk about something or if

5032.239 --> 5038.959999999999
you're just hanging around then yeah I

5036.139 --> 5039.9490000000005
am open for guests because I'm pretty

5038.96 --> 5041.719
much done

5039.949 --> 5044.0
yeah I've talked about everything that's

5041.719 --> 5046.94
interesting that I could talk about my

5044.0 --> 5049.67
game oh well that's not gonna be too

5046.94 --> 5051.558999999999
interesting except that I really enjoy

5049.67 --> 5056.679
the music a lot and that I'm looking

5051.559 --> 5056.679
into that even more so that's it

5069.32 --> 5077.13
I'm kind of like wondering who's the

5072.03 --> 5079.32
next gonna go astray because I now got

5077.13 --> 5082.29
personal attacks from right to hand and

5079.32 --> 5086.66
I got personal attacks from spur scheme

5082.29 --> 5086.66
oh I wonder who's gonna be next

5093.07 --> 5100.87
I'm just really glad I got Dasia on my

5096.1 --> 5109.06
side I really appreciate that guy he

5100.87 --> 5110.2
gets so much and I think I'm gonna like

5109.06 --> 5113.530000000001
need him

5110.2 --> 5115.66
to reach the final stages of this

5113.53 --> 5122.679999999999
figuring out all of this quantum

5115.66 --> 5126.25
mechanics here and we'll get there but

5122.68 --> 5132.04
anyway yeah a light does seem to have a

5126.25 --> 5134.62
speed so unfortunately that's that does

5132.04 --> 5136.54
take away a bit of the potential mystery

5134.62 --> 5138.91
that I could have presupposed with all

5136.54 --> 5143.74
that who knows I'll just do it like a

5138.91 --> 5147.16
hobby afterward anyway just to see what

5143.74 --> 5148.84
it would have been roughly like but yeah

5147.16 --> 5151.18
I'm gonna go have to go with the speed

5148.84 --> 5155.47
so then it is like how does this work

5151.18 --> 5157.900000000001
how does it propel itself like is it a

5155.47 --> 5160.12
wave or it does it just seem wave like

5157.9 --> 5162.19
what is going on is it like lightning

5160.12 --> 5164.53
because there's also very mysterious

5162.19 --> 5168.07
elements about that is there some kind

5164.53 --> 5171.73
of instantaneous connection with the

5168.07 --> 5176.349999999999
material following up is that what's

5171.73 --> 5179.11
going on probably not but the while the

5176.35 --> 5182.02
correlations like for example how light

5179.11 --> 5184.2699999999995
slows down apparently due to the

5182.02 --> 5187.6
thickness of the medium and then speeds

5184.27 --> 5190.42
back up again like a real almost like a

5187.6 --> 5192.7300000000005
traveling animal that just moves out of

5190.42 --> 5195.16
the bog and can just run faster again

5192.73 --> 5200.04
that that seems to be what light does

5195.16 --> 5203.7699999999995
and it's pretty unique and has

5200.04 --> 5206.8
similarities to wave perpetuation like

5203.77 --> 5210.85
behavior but that's only an apparent

5206.8 --> 5214.17
connection so there's more to be figured

5210.85 --> 5216.160000000001
out much more mystery much more

5214.17 --> 5218.4400000000005
presuppositional traps much more

5216.16 --> 5220.599999999999
aberrations popping up like oh look it

5218.44 --> 5222.099999999999
must be this immediately because it

5220.6 --> 5224.8
looks so much alike and that's the

5222.1 --> 5227.17
that's the pitfall every time so every

5224.8 --> 5229.06
time get all these

5227.17 --> 5232.81
out of the way and figure out what's

5229.06 --> 5235.96
really going on here and I'm pretty sure

5232.81 --> 5238.870000000001
that we'll get there eventually it's

5235.96 --> 5240.55
probably not even gonna take too long by

5238.87 --> 5243.01
the way thank you or earth is seriously

5240.55 --> 5244.84
flat for the $2 super jet donation happy

5243.01 --> 5249.43
flattered a perfect day for street

5244.84 --> 5253.03
activism maybe over there and here not

5249.43 --> 5256.320000000001
so much it's kind of rainy but yes

5253.03 --> 5256.32
Saturday is a good day for that

5262.53 --> 5269.49
yes stone monkey 3d I did talk about the

5265.81 --> 5273.370000000001
Doppler effect before it is how I

5269.49 --> 5276.19
alternatively are hypothesized as to how

5273.37 --> 5280.84
they could have measured the speed by

5276.19 --> 5285.009999999999
applying Doppler changes which didn't

5280.84 --> 5288.82
necessarily according to my view based

5285.01 --> 5293.29
on time not traveling a speed would

5288.82 --> 5295.48
still be a viable effect to use as

5293.29 --> 5298.51
measurement basically to deduce the

5295.48 --> 5302.5599999999995
speed instead of applying the light

5298.51 --> 5305.29
speed itself as a measuring stick so

5302.56 --> 5309.7300000000005
that's how I argued that out through the

5305.29 --> 5311.83
Doppler effect but that was presupposing

5309.73 --> 5315.3099999999995
that light would not be having a speed

5311.83 --> 5316.99
and then would be the cause of the

5315.31 --> 5319.570000000001
Doppler effect would be different so I

5316.99 --> 5322.09
would have to have figured that out then

5319.57 --> 5324.34
also as I would go on the course of

5322.09 --> 5326.13
presupposing I didn't have a speed but

5324.34 --> 5328.81
yeah that's not gonna happen right now

5326.13 --> 5331.57
because there are these signs that like

5328.81 --> 5336.27
that does unfortunately for me I guess

5331.57 --> 5339.429999999999
have a speed cutting off that that path

5336.27 --> 5342.160000000001
at least as a real long-term viable

5339.43 --> 5346.09
course maybe as a speculation could be

5342.16 --> 5350.98
funny to do but so I'm gonna go with ya

5346.09 --> 5355.3
like having a speed in in guelph future

5350.98 --> 5357.9
presuppositions or figuring out how how

5355.3 --> 5357.900000000001
light works

5361.38 --> 5366.52
right but for now I'm gonna round out

5365.2 --> 5369.58
the show because I don't think I'm gonna

5366.52 --> 5371.8
get guests anytime soon and then kind of

5369.58 --> 5376.24
run out of steam as well getting a bit

5371.8 --> 5378.58
hungry and actually but thanks everyone

5376.24 --> 5381.04
for coming and yeah the super chair

5378.58 --> 5383.41
donations great thank you for all the

5381.04 --> 5388.9
support I feels really good thank you so
