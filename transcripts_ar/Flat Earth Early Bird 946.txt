there's some actual blue spots in

91.979 --> 97.02
between the clouds

94.079 --> 100.979
had some nice Sun it is really warm but

97.02 --> 103.19999999999999
also standing out is

100.979 --> 105.92
it's a strong wind blowing it has been

103.2 --> 105.92
for a while

108.36 --> 114.72
in the earlier morning it was completely

111.84 --> 117.24000000000001
clear sky then as soon as the clouds

114.72 --> 121.399
started rolling in

117.24 --> 121.399
it became quite windy

124.5 --> 127.28
so yeah

129.539 --> 134.819
another interesting summer day

132.239 --> 137.72
over here

134.819 --> 137.72
in the Netherlands

138.3 --> 143.16000000000003
hello Tom Parker first in chat good to

141.06 --> 146.52
see you

143.16 --> 148.94
so yeah yesterday's show was a complete

146.52 --> 148.94
mess

150.18 --> 155.81900000000002
ah

152.34 --> 159.36
but today will not be

155.819 --> 161.94
feel a lot better and

159.36 --> 163.5
managed to come contact my healer as

161.94 --> 166.64
well and

163.5 --> 166.64
set things straight

170.04 --> 175.5
also yeah

171.9 --> 180.08
it wasn't just me apparently yesterday

175.5 --> 180.08
was a weird day and a lot of people

181.26 --> 186.72
like I've called my friend

184.319 --> 189.89999999999998
or she well she called me

186.72 --> 191.28
actually uh and she

189.9 --> 193.92000000000002
well

191.28 --> 196.68
had similar experiences

193.92 --> 198.659
except like she didn't have a hangover

196.68 --> 202.26000000000002
or anything but like for her her day

198.659 --> 204.42
also was like totally chaotic and stuff

202.26 --> 209.57999999999998
and

204.42 --> 212.51899999999998
over sensitive it was weird so yeah

209.58 --> 214.68
it wasn't just

212.519 --> 215.81900000000002
drinking the bad alcohol although yeah

214.68 --> 219.56
it's

215.819 --> 219.56
it was like the Tipping Point

221.459 --> 227.04
but yeah as I predicted I'm back and I'm

224.4 --> 229.58
completely restored a really good

227.04 --> 229.57999999999998
night's sleep

232.68 --> 236.18
the second Lord of the Rings movie

237.54 --> 240.14
yeah

240.319 --> 245.599
and also yeah old Benjamin Had a new

243.239 --> 245.59900000000002
stream

246.18 --> 251.22
that popped up pretty late and continued

249.659 --> 253.939
watching that this morning it's a long

251.22 --> 253.939
stream so

254.7 --> 262.459
continue that somewhere later in the day

258.18 --> 262.459
hello tiny Womble good to see you

263.84 --> 270.53999999999996
so yeah yesterday man I was really

268.02 --> 273.35999999999996
over sensitive and especially the

270.54 --> 277.34000000000003
freaking beep man at the end it totally

273.36 --> 277.34000000000003
drove me nuts it was like

279.0 --> 283.199
yeah I couldn't

281.16 --> 286.91900000000004
stop hearing it

283.199 --> 289.86
like I when I was like really like ah

286.919 --> 291.9
running around I tried to hide in the

289.86 --> 294.24
bathroom like in the in the toilet

291.9 --> 295.79999999999995
sounds really weird right I thought like

294.24 --> 297.6
okay there's enough walls in between

295.8 --> 300.18
there that I shouldn't be hearing it

297.6 --> 302.58000000000004
well guess what you did you heard it

300.18 --> 306.139
throughout the whole freaking apartment

302.58 --> 306.139
it was totally nuts

307.259 --> 312.91900000000004
the only way I could basically

309.96 --> 312.919
get it out

312.96 --> 317.88
of reaching me get out of its range was

315.78 --> 319.19899999999996
literally just exiting the building on

317.88 --> 322.259
the other side

319.199 --> 324.0
like I even walked up because the guy I

322.259 --> 326.039
just told him like dude can't you

324.0 --> 328.919
somehow turn that beeping off it's

326.039 --> 331.58
driving me insane

328.919 --> 331.58
uh

334.199 --> 339.24
but I'm pretty sure that I didn't have

336.84 --> 341.82
any form of Hangover it would still have

339.24 --> 345.36
drove me driven me insane because it was

341.82 --> 347.88
so loud and just went through everything

345.36 --> 352.46000000000004
so it would have certainly ruined my

347.88 --> 352.46
mood one way or the other anyway

353.039 --> 356.639
not today though I don't think they're

354.9 --> 360.13899999999995
going to be doing any work with this

356.639 --> 360.139
type of wind anyhow

360.18 --> 364.44
hey I'll kill the Hope long time no see

363.0 --> 367.28
good to see you man

364.44 --> 367.28
good servant

369.24 --> 372.5
also good to see you

373.08 --> 377.94
right

374.639 --> 383.12
so yeah yesterday there are some weird

377.94 --> 383.12
things also involving in my hangouts

384.479 --> 389.9
like seeking star water said something

387.419 --> 389.9
weird

390.18 --> 393.74
I actually uh

395.22 --> 400.86
took my time with the Healer to even try

398.58 --> 403.8
to analyze it without names by the way

400.86 --> 406.44
just thinking about it

403.8 --> 408.479
is enough

406.44 --> 410.94
so seeking star water acted a little

408.479 --> 414.8
weird at the end basically saying I'm

410.94 --> 414.8
not supporting you anymore and then

415.199 --> 421.38
so maybe she was in a really freaky mood

418.8 --> 423.599
too and I think that maybe Guns of

421.38 --> 425.88
Navarone had a similar experience and I

423.599 --> 428.58
think that both of them came to me to My

425.88 --> 431.699
Hangout to hope to be

428.58 --> 434.099
released from that sensation

431.699 --> 435.90000000000003
but then it turned out I was right stuck

434.099 --> 437.699
into the same thing and they were

435.9 --> 441.479
probably both like in a more visceral

437.699 --> 441.479
way really disappointed

443.58 --> 449.639
and yeah

446.22 --> 452.09900000000005
guns of nefarone rmp like sent a comment

449.639 --> 454.62
afterward in response to the baller that

452.099 --> 456.84
was totally spamming my comment section

454.62 --> 459.72
I deleted like all the messages it was

456.84 --> 461.46
all [ __ ] it's like 20 messages the

459.72 --> 464.40000000000003
guy was going nuts

461.46 --> 466.85999999999996
didn't really make a point

464.4 --> 469.56
but then yeah I left the one where guns

466.86 --> 472.22
replied and he said some things that I

469.56 --> 472.22
thought were

472.379 --> 476.0
like a huge low blow

476.4 --> 483.539
So I responded to him

480.419 --> 485.69899999999996
it's still there for anybody to see and

483.539 --> 489.979
I will keep it there

485.699 --> 489.979
and I will inquire further because

490.02 --> 495.24
yeah guns and everyone has supported me

492.3 --> 497.34000000000003
in the past Super chats and through

495.24 --> 499.8
paypals too I think

497.34 --> 502.919
and now

499.8 --> 505.5
apparently it's a waste of time to help

502.919 --> 508.19899999999996
our win out financially because I am

505.5 --> 511.819
apparently only wasting it

508.199 --> 511.819
on drugs and alcohol

513.779 --> 517.4399999999999
and I thought that was like

516.12 --> 521.519
dude

517.44 --> 524.519
I I got sort of a hangover

521.519 --> 528.899
and how many times has that happened

524.519 --> 530.519
maybe like four times in total all the

528.899 --> 533.7
streaming that I did over the years

530.519 --> 536.04
maybe that happened four times and it

533.7 --> 539.0400000000001
came the alcohol came from a bottle that

536.04 --> 541.92
I bought freaking 13 years ago

539.04 --> 543.779
this is

541.92 --> 547.5
so

543.779 --> 550.32
yeah yesterday's show Monday show

547.5 --> 553.86
945

550.32 --> 555.48
it was a mess I was just over said I had

553.86 --> 558.24
to walk away constantly I couldn't

555.48 --> 561.1800000000001
really intellectually engage much said a

558.24 --> 563.22
couple of things but I was just

561.18 --> 565.0799999999999
I couldn't handle it

563.22 --> 567.44
so I rounded out the show early

565.08 --> 567.44
yesterday

572.279 --> 577.5
maybe when you don't have a hangover

574.32 --> 579.24
after a heavy drink yeah I agree to that

577.5 --> 583.519
tiny Womble

579.24 --> 583.519
that's when you need to worry absolutely

591.06 --> 596.16
all right yeah

593.16 --> 598.68
thank you tiny Womble for agreeing I

596.16 --> 601.4399999999999
just thought it was it just feels like a

598.68 --> 604.38
low blow because it's been nice to me

601.44 --> 607.9200000000001
it's nice in other chats he's never

604.38 --> 612.0
really like addressed me that he saw or

607.92 --> 614.54
thought I'd have some kind of a problem

612.0 --> 614.54
right

615.54 --> 621.48
or warn me like dude I've really liked

619.14 --> 623.399
your work or something but I'm afraid

621.48 --> 625.26
that your drinking habits is something

623.399 --> 627.42
that I can't agree with

625.26 --> 629.66
and then talk about it no he hasn't done

627.42 --> 629.66
that

630.36 --> 636.48
at all

631.5 --> 638.399
but to then reply to some troll comment

636.48 --> 642.2
throwing that out that's that's

638.399 --> 642.2
insulting that's literally

642.3 --> 646.3199999999999
happy face on the one side and then

644.76 --> 650.72
getting caught

646.32 --> 650.72
in my chat room no no less

651.48 --> 657.3000000000001
like talking behind my back like that

653.72 --> 658.98
like nobody talks behind my back to my

657.3 --> 661.8199999999999
face right

658.98 --> 661.82
don't do that

671.399 --> 677.36
uh

673.2 --> 677.36
right I just needed to address that

677.519 --> 681.899
also I want to hear back from seeking

680.1 --> 683.94
star water I want to know what what's

681.899 --> 687.32
going on here

683.94 --> 687.32
are you all right

688.92 --> 695.519
I mean I'm sorry if you just

691.68 --> 697.3199999999999
if I kind of broke your day by being

695.519 --> 701.1
through yeah being in what I was

697.32 --> 704.22
yesterday I'm really sorry

701.1 --> 706.5600000000001
but yeah it happens sometimes

704.22 --> 710.779
you know swing after pendulum sudden

706.56 --> 710.779
crash it's not the first time

711.54 --> 718.139
happens

713.76 --> 720.66
in its own right last October

718.139 --> 722.04
and what's much worse the anger was sick

720.66 --> 724.56
for a week

722.04 --> 726.899
much worse

724.56 --> 729.959
but it all had to do I even knew it back

726.899 --> 732.36
then I got manic afterwards all has to

729.959 --> 734.2199999999999
do with energy and what I do with the

732.36 --> 738.12
energy and what I'm doing here on the

734.22 --> 738.12
show with my energy also

740.76 --> 747.12
the test the task

744.06 --> 750.8
that I'm charged with

747.12 --> 750.8
by myself by God

751.98 --> 756.6800000000001
it

753.959 --> 760.38
it prevents me

756.68 --> 763.4399999999999
from sharing sensations of personal

760.38 --> 766.579
weakness I'm really dedicated to to

763.44 --> 766.5790000000001
taking that out

767.279 --> 771.079
but it has resulted in

771.42 --> 776.639
those feelings kind of piling up in the

773.94 --> 779.1
background and I think that that

776.639 --> 781.32
is the bucket that's that had been

779.1 --> 784.82
slowly filled

781.32 --> 788.1600000000001
and then sadly when it's full

784.82 --> 790.5
I I just want to escape because I don't

788.16 --> 792.6
know a way out and then I make rash

790.5 --> 795.12
decisions like

792.6 --> 797.4590000000001
I run out of here I'm just gonna grab

795.12 --> 800.04
that bottle and not think about that

797.459 --> 802.9799999999999
that's probably a really bad idea right

800.04 --> 805.3199999999999
I just don't want to think anymore when

802.98 --> 807.779
that when that bucket's full

805.32 --> 811.019
and that's how it then spills and it

807.779 --> 813.06
basically Falls over

811.019 --> 815.779
and that's what what I feel happened

813.06 --> 815.779
Sunday night

821.16 --> 827.399
ah okay I'm gonna kill the Hope anyway

825.24 --> 830.66
but money's stacking gold and silver

827.399 --> 830.66
yeah I'm all for that

833.16 --> 837.48
dude I it's

835.8 --> 839.8199999999999
parked

837.48 --> 842.779
of the reason I really became a

839.82 --> 842.779
Goldsmith too

843.36 --> 845.899
like

846.42 --> 852.36
because I I do appreciate stacking

849.48 --> 854.339
silver and gold and I did do that back

852.36 --> 857.76
in the day when I had more money for my

854.339 --> 860.94
inheritance my mother

857.76 --> 864.0
but I

860.94 --> 868.6800000000001
I did not understand enough about money

864.0 --> 871.44
to realize that snow use stacking

868.68 --> 874.62
if you don't constantly produce if

871.44 --> 876.36
you're just going to end up consuming it

874.62 --> 880.8
all without

876.36 --> 882.1800000000001
evening up the output the income then it

880.8 --> 885.54
doesn't really matter what you're gonna

882.18 --> 888.42
buy with its silver gold anything you're

885.54 --> 892.98
just going to sell it again just to get

888.42 --> 894.959
by so that's the like really annoying

892.98 --> 900.139
mistakes

894.959 --> 900.1389999999999
big mistake it's one mistake that I made

900.54 --> 906.54
13 years ago in that time

903.36 --> 908.88
I didn't know how to be self-sufficient

906.54 --> 911.9399999999999
I had a lot of money I didn't know how

908.88 --> 916.04
to maintain that money and I was really

911.94 --> 916.0400000000001
shy for advice but at the same time

916.68 --> 922.8
did not have a reliable network of

919.68 --> 924.3599999999999
people around me through my family or

922.8 --> 928.56
friends

924.36 --> 931.8000000000001
so I I couldn't find a way through

928.56 --> 934.2589999999999
and then I decided in I'd like I'll just

931.8 --> 936.959
gonna throw it on art

934.259 --> 941.1800000000001
on just making things and on Spiritual

936.959 --> 945.0
Development and my ethereal things

941.18 --> 947.699
symbolics.nl and designs

945.0 --> 952.82
but it was really because

947.699 --> 952.8199999999999
I didn't know the way through

954.899 --> 960.6
right so anyway to round that up uh kill

958.44 --> 963.3000000000001
the Hope yes

960.6 --> 966.0
gold and silver solid though don't take

963.3 --> 969.4799999999999
any freaking coupons

966.0 --> 970.5
the real stuff only yeah it's great the

969.48 --> 973.019
store

970.5 --> 976.38
but make sure that you actually can

973.019 --> 977.839
store it and not be forced to to sell it

976.38 --> 981.72
right

977.839 --> 984.0600000000001
what you really want it for is for when

981.72 --> 985.5
finances like The Current financial

984.06 --> 988.0189999999999
system

985.5 --> 990.74
totally destabilizes for some reason

988.019 --> 990.74
could be anything

992.04 --> 997.62
I mean it's not very likely to happen

994.92 --> 999.959
anytime soon here in the Netherlands at

997.62 --> 1001.04
least maybe like Germany perhaps there's

999.959 --> 1005.8
some

1001.04 --> 1005.8
pressure on that German Bank dude but

1005.839 --> 1009.8000000000001
but the Netherlands

1007.94 --> 1012.019
like if our neighbors are gonna

1009.8 --> 1013.699
financially fall then it's very likely

1012.019 --> 1016.519
we'll have blowback of it and

1013.699 --> 1020.0
consequences of it as well so

1016.519 --> 1021.5600000000001
having it stacked

1020.0 --> 1024.14
that's

1021.56 --> 1026.24
that's good because then you have

1024.14 --> 1027.919
something that retains its value when

1026.24 --> 1030.88
suddenly

1027.919 --> 1030.88
printed money

1031.16 --> 1036.3190000000002
starts the falter and disintegrate or

1033.86 --> 1038.36
destabilizing value right that's that's

1036.319 --> 1041.319
when you want the solid thing in a box

1038.36 --> 1041.319
or in the safe

1043.22 --> 1049.3600000000001
but if you have don't have a

1046.28 --> 1049.36
stable income

1049.88 --> 1054.7990000000002
then it's oh yeah it's it's kind of

1052.52 --> 1056.6
pointless to start stacking silver and

1054.799 --> 1059.3799999999999
gold because

1056.6 --> 1061.2199999999998
yeah you're just gonna end up using it

1059.38 --> 1063.8600000000001
selling it

1061.22 --> 1065.48
for money again

1063.86 --> 1070.059
anyway

1065.48 --> 1070.059
hope that helps hey Dutch sailor

1076.76 --> 1084.28
right now yeah it's it's great for

1080.14 --> 1084.2800000000002
long-term value storage

1089.299 --> 1094.6
but as a

1091.82 --> 1097.039
liquidity

1094.6 --> 1099.02
using it as currency that's something

1097.039 --> 1101.179
completely different I mean you can get

1099.02 --> 1105.8799999999999
into friend circles

1101.179 --> 1105.88
or people that particularly like that

1105.919 --> 1112.16
that will

1107.419 --> 1114.5
sell you services or trade things for

1112.16 --> 1117.679
silver or gold coins right

1114.5 --> 1120.799
they might be eager to get those you

1117.679 --> 1124.039
could use it for that

1120.799 --> 1125.72
you know some people even way back that

1124.039 --> 1128.179
I knew

1125.72 --> 1130.039
they were very into that they they

1128.179 --> 1133.2800000000002
thought like yeah we're gonna just

1130.039 --> 1135.32
replace they had the idea oh like oh

1133.28 --> 1138.08
Bitcoin Bitcoin oh everything's going to

1135.32 --> 1140.24
use Bitcoin they thought well we can

1138.08 --> 1142.6399999999999
just get a network of people that like

1140.24 --> 1145.34
to deal in gold and silver and use it as

1142.64 --> 1147.5
currency like who's stopping it nobody

1145.34 --> 1149.6
you can't even legally stop that and

1147.5 --> 1151.76
then just thought oh that's gonna really

1149.6 --> 1154.28
hit and then you can have this as a

1151.76 --> 1156.44
secondary currency and hey those people

1154.28 --> 1160.039
probably with the right Circles of

1156.44 --> 1163.8400000000001
people around them are still doing that

1160.039 --> 1163.84
if they still have the passion for it

1165.44 --> 1167.8600000000001
all right

1171.98 --> 1177.2
you think I will make it to the

1174.799 --> 1179.48
thousandth episode absolutely

1177.2 --> 1182.44
of course I will what's going to stop me

1179.48 --> 1182.44
that black fella

1183.679 --> 1188.3200000000002
oh hello by the way Rob H good to see

1186.2 --> 1188.32
you

1206.72 --> 1210.799
I'll work sometimes for government for

1208.64 --> 1212.0590000000002
my booth that doesn't have to suck I

1210.799 --> 1216.02
would kill the hope

1212.059 --> 1218.9189999999999
all depends what you are doing

1216.02 --> 1218.9189999999999
for the government

1221.179 --> 1227.919
I mean there are just jobs to be done

1224.0 --> 1227.919
and sometimes government

1228.98 --> 1235.4
is the one that just arranges it

1232.82 --> 1238.0
and not a company right and sometimes

1235.4 --> 1238.0
that's better

1240.02 --> 1244.539
it it tends to make things slower

1245.299 --> 1251.72
and yeah instead of morality issues

1249.919 --> 1254.9
which typically happens with companies

1251.72 --> 1258.2
there will be bureaucracy sloth issues

1254.9 --> 1262.0
with changes finances updates all that

1258.2 --> 1262.0
right that's the typical difference

1262.58 --> 1266.32
working for the government doesn't make

1264.679 --> 1270.3200000000002
you automatically your government

1266.32 --> 1272.799
bureaucrat bureaucrat so

1270.32 --> 1272.799
uh

1272.96 --> 1278.32
making animations explained oh God you

1276.14 --> 1278.3200000000002
too

1281.84 --> 1286.6589999999999
I thought you were talking about the

1284.0 --> 1286.659
Forestry

1287.36 --> 1290.4189999999999
huh that's weird man I don't kill the

1289.22 --> 1292.76
hope

1290.419 --> 1294.8600000000001
because yeah the new roommate who's

1292.76 --> 1296.6589999999999
who's here like once a week for some

1294.86 --> 1299.24
reason and not more

1296.659 --> 1301.7600000000002
she does that too she's an animator and

1299.24 --> 1303.98
she makes guess what Corona instruction

1301.76 --> 1305.9
videos

1303.98 --> 1309.76
for a bank

1305.9 --> 1309.76
or multiple Banks really

1313.28 --> 1318.82
so that seems it's just a a project

1319.4 --> 1323.9
coronu indoctrination animations to get

1322.64 --> 1327.5200000000002
people

1323.9 --> 1327.52
in that right

1327.86 --> 1332.539
you probably know her

1330.32 --> 1335.24
really

1332.539 --> 1338.12
she works over here though

1335.24 --> 1340.22
in Utrecht

1338.12 --> 1342.02
is she's used oh Joe you're back in your

1340.22 --> 1344.559
track are you I thought you were in

1342.02 --> 1344.559
Arnhem

1345.919 --> 1350.0590000000002
or was it Neymar

1348.14 --> 1353.919
I thought you were in the east

1350.059 --> 1353.9189999999999
are you back to Utrecht

1359.659 --> 1363.5200000000002
Omen right sorry

1377.12 --> 1384.86
no you don't DMK 2020 no you don't

1382.58 --> 1386.539
besides you don't really see it

1384.86 --> 1389.12
you're just saying it to annoy me and

1386.539 --> 1393.3799999999999
that's why I'm Banning you

1389.12 --> 1397.299
don't like pointless inserts

1393.38 --> 1397.2990000000002
in my conversations with Jack

1398.89 --> 1402.449
[Music]

1408.679 --> 1415.539
and people that use crayons or turds for

1412.52 --> 1415.539
icons yeah

1415.88 --> 1418.8400000000001
mm-hmm

1419.24 --> 1424.88
you know a lot of animators from YouTube

1421.279 --> 1426.559
okay well then you might know her

1424.88 --> 1429.22
I

1426.559 --> 1429.22
I don't

1429.799 --> 1433.58
I can't remember her name I'm terrible

1432.38 --> 1435.0800000000002
names

1433.58 --> 1437.559
again

1435.08 --> 1437.559
anyway

1439.82 --> 1446.72
like I've barely spoken to her anyway

1443.299 --> 1449.4189999999999
she's like a bit

1446.72 --> 1451.34
bit shy

1449.419 --> 1453.74
it's really hard to get a rolling

1451.34 --> 1456.34
conversation

1453.74 --> 1456.34
uh

1473.419 --> 1475.96
hmm

1485.559 --> 1490.1789999999999
right anyway it's good to see you too

1491.74 --> 1496.72
I'm happy that I have some Dutch

1494.299 --> 1496.72
followers

1498.26 --> 1504.52
I wish there would be more people

1501.679 --> 1504.52
out here

1508.159 --> 1515.8400000000001
what's today's topic nothing special

1510.919 --> 1518.659
iron 26 I it's very rare that I have a

1515.84 --> 1522.08
specific topic

1518.659 --> 1525.7
if I do then you it's very likely you'll

1522.08 --> 1525.6999999999998
see it in the title of the show

1530.24 --> 1536.799
are we getting a party

1532.46 --> 1536.799
early bird thousand is it why

1536.96 --> 1542.32
Oh you mean a party in real life

1539.72 --> 1542.32
huh

1542.96 --> 1549.14
dude I haven't had a party

1546.86 --> 1553.12
since

1549.14 --> 1555.74
Clone Wars now it uh since

1553.12 --> 1561.8799999999999
uh Jesus

1555.74 --> 1561.88
long time ago yeah since 2012. huh

1563.14 --> 1568.0
I've had to party since the end of the

1565.88 --> 1568.0
world

1568.7 --> 1573.82
like after that I kind of stopped

1570.919 --> 1573.8200000000002
celebrating everything

1577.58 --> 1581.02
but I don't know yeah maybe

1587.779 --> 1592.279
although yeah this place over here is

1590.24 --> 1594.94
really not much of a place for a party

1592.279 --> 1594.94
at all

1602.539 --> 1610.299
quite a part oh

1606.44 --> 1610.299
right I forgot

1611.059 --> 1616.34
well

1613.159 --> 1618.3200000000002
party well yeah it's a conference but I

1616.34 --> 1620.8999999999999
guess that it was kind of like a party

1618.32 --> 1623.0
yeah I almost forgot that's right so

1620.9 --> 1626.3200000000002
it's not that long ago

1623.0 --> 1626.32
19. so it's been

1626.659 --> 1629.679
two years

1632.11 --> 1635.2299999999998
[Music]

1650.679 --> 1654.5800000000002
no clovers alone

1660.919 --> 1666.5590000000002
I don't think there would come that flat

1663.2 --> 1668.5
fellow I think that any globers

1666.559 --> 1674.1789999999999
that know of me

1668.5 --> 1677.299
they probably [ __ ] their pants

1674.179 --> 1679.88
in my proximity or just get really weird

1677.299 --> 1682.399
and incessantly start to babble out loud

1679.88 --> 1684.5590000000002
in the in themselves in my proximity

1682.399 --> 1687.4599999999998
I've seen that

1684.559 --> 1687.46
people do that

1688.399 --> 1693.02
so sometimes I feel like I'm a ring

1691.1 --> 1696.5
Wraith

1693.02 --> 1699.26
and just getting close to them they know

1696.5 --> 1701.899
who I am or get the feeling of it and

1699.26 --> 1704.24
it's just like they start like they

1701.899 --> 1706.779
start to go all grabbing for their rings

1704.24 --> 1706.779
and [ __ ]

1713.059 --> 1717.74
yeah dude I've just been watching Lord

1715.159 --> 1720.7990000000002
of the Rings so it was bound to happen

1717.74 --> 1722.84
some metaphor was gonna happen

1720.799 --> 1726.2
why would they [ __ ] their pants well

1722.84 --> 1729.62
because they know they are [ __ ]

1726.2 --> 1731.299
they know they are lying ninny and

1729.62 --> 1733.58
gammas

1731.299 --> 1735.9189999999999
and that they have nothing and I'm a

1733.58 --> 1737.6589999999999
person it's very straightforward very

1735.919 --> 1741.679
direct

1737.659 --> 1743.8990000000001
the great depth and they feel that I can

1741.679 --> 1747.3200000000002
see

1743.899 --> 1749.2399999999998
how much they lie to themselves and how

1747.32 --> 1752.6589999999999
weak them they are and that hurts

1749.24 --> 1754.94
because they spend a lot of time not

1752.659 --> 1757.3400000000001
being in the know of that and escaping

1754.94 --> 1760.64
that knowledge for themselves

1757.34 --> 1762.62
and that's why they [ __ ] their pants

1760.64 --> 1764.48
and there's a lot of those people you

1762.62 --> 1767.799
know it's not even necessarily Ballers

1764.48 --> 1767.799
it might just be people

1768.14 --> 1774.1000000000001
that will be offended by any of my other

1771.44 --> 1774.1000000000001
opinions

1775.64 --> 1778.24
right

1788.98 --> 1795.6200000000001
hey the Big M yeah I'm doing great

1792.98 --> 1797.659
much better than yesterday

1795.62 --> 1800.6
not surprising though because yesterday

1797.659 --> 1802.6000000000001
was pretty shitty

1800.6 --> 1802.6
um

1815.24 --> 1818.24
foreign

1822.399 --> 1830.4399999999998
also some the whole Mark Smiler Saga is

1827.84 --> 1830.4399999999998
continuing

1830.6 --> 1836.12
he sent me a PayPal again

1833.48 --> 1839.24
not a scent but just actual amount so

1836.12 --> 1843.02
yeah thanks Mark he he is actually still

1839.24 --> 1845.6
trying to get bright me

1843.02 --> 1849.8799999999999
it's really weird

1845.6 --> 1849.8799999999999
like I've already told him

1850.58 --> 1856.279
and he just keeps going and he really

1853.88 --> 1859.159
wants me to

1856.279 --> 1860.659
to do a couple of things which he's

1859.159 --> 1863.72
convinced of which are absolutely

1860.659 --> 1867.46
ludicrous and he still persists

1863.72 --> 1867.46
so there's yeah

1870.559 --> 1874.94
that is weird

1872.24 --> 1876.559
like I don't know why the guy apparently

1874.94 --> 1880.1000000000001
he has a lot of money

1876.559 --> 1881.899
okay otherwise you don't just do this

1880.1 --> 1884.7199999999998
crazy [ __ ]

1881.899 --> 1887.1999999999998
apparently he has plenty of money to

1884.72 --> 1887.2
throw around

1887.659 --> 1891.8200000000002
doesn't have any other priorities for it

1894.679 --> 1899.179
all right and I'm not just going to keep

1897.14 --> 1901.3990000000001
sending it back

1899.179 --> 1904.64
right I will take his money

1901.399 --> 1909.1
but it will also be direct and honest

1904.64 --> 1909.1000000000001
about what I think about his ideas

1910.22 --> 1916.039
and I'm gonna overall minimize the

1912.679 --> 1918.46
responses but yeah it's like that's

1916.039 --> 1918.46
still going

1919.7 --> 1922.7
uh

1924.86 --> 1929.36
what are is that his ideas is that I

1927.14 --> 1931.279
have supposedly implants he's obsessed

1929.36 --> 1934.9399999999998
with the idea of implants

1931.279 --> 1938.659
and now I have talked about implants

1934.94 --> 1942.74
you can through various sources

1938.659 --> 1944.5390000000002
Dr Hammer was also

1942.74 --> 1948.26
bringing

1944.539 --> 1951.32
yeah implants to the attention

1948.26 --> 1953.179
and that's real right so it and it is a

1951.32 --> 1955.279
freaky thing and there is some weird

1953.179 --> 1958.24
involvement with implants and vaccines

1955.279 --> 1958.24
yes

1958.399 --> 1965.059
not in the way that is being upheld in

1961.94 --> 1968.179
even alternative conspiracy media

1965.059 --> 1969.559
just no nobody

1968.179 --> 1972.919
really

1969.559 --> 1976.1
addresses this and I don't really have

1972.919 --> 1979.3400000000001
enough data to address it myself

1976.1 --> 1982.34
but yeah Mark is convinced that I have

1979.34 --> 1985.299
been like implanted on my head

1982.34 --> 1987.86
locally and that that is supposedly

1985.299 --> 1990.74
influencing my hair loss which is just

1987.86 --> 1992.7199999999998
[ __ ] because if that were the case

1990.74 --> 1995.24
then it's extremely ineffective because

1992.72 --> 1997.88
my hair has really not changed that much

1995.24 --> 2000.539
in 20 years

1997.88 --> 2000.5390000000002
right

2000.58 --> 2005.6789999999999
so yeah that's what he thinks he thinks

2003.64 --> 2007.779
that my head is magnetic because of

2005.679 --> 2009.88
implants and it's causing all kinds of

2007.779 --> 2013.36
things and I need to get special magnets

2009.88 --> 2016.48
and well technically dude if he wants to

2013.36 --> 2019.1789999999999
send me this special boy magnets that

2016.48 --> 2021.64
will work

2019.179 --> 2023.919
do the thing that he thinks they will do

2021.64 --> 2026.74
yeah

2023.919 --> 2030.1000000000001
send it to me send it to me in the mail

2026.74 --> 2034.059
if you really want that right I'm not

2030.1 --> 2037.1789999999999
going to buy it for you no way

2034.059 --> 2039.0
because I don't even want to be caught

2037.179 --> 2041.2
by the machine

2039.0 --> 2044.32
engaging in that

2041.2 --> 2046.8990000000001
but if you send some of that stuff to me

2044.32 --> 2049.179
because you insist

2046.899 --> 2051.399
if you're willing to bribe me to make me

2049.179 --> 2053.26
do something that you might just as well

2051.399 --> 2055.72
just buy that [ __ ] and send it to me

2053.26 --> 2057.579
sure I'll try it I'll freaking try it

2055.72 --> 2059.56
out on camera and show that yeah even

2057.579 --> 2062.679
your special boy magnet is just gonna

2059.56 --> 2065.7999999999997
kick poof fall off because my head is

2062.679 --> 2068.46
not freaking magnetic I've already tried

2065.8 --> 2068.46
it actually

2069.52 --> 2072.06
right

2072.28 --> 2075.96
I just won't give up

2077.619 --> 2081.82
it's weird

2079.419 --> 2083.98
right anyway I shouldn't be paying so

2081.82 --> 2087.159
much attention to it because the guy is

2083.98 --> 2092.2
just crazy and he needs to just drop it

2087.159 --> 2092.2000000000003
but yeah he sends me money okay

2092.859 --> 2097.119
it's not gonna change anything though

2095.26 --> 2100.0600000000004
sending me money

2097.119 --> 2103.3
because my conditions are you send me to

2100.06 --> 2105.9
support what I do you don't get a say in

2103.3 --> 2105.9
what I do

2108.88 --> 2111.48
right

2123.52 --> 2126.18
so

2157.96 --> 2163.359
except Brenda she can come really that

2160.66 --> 2166.0789999999997
flat fellow

2163.359 --> 2166.0789999999997
God

2166.78 --> 2172.48
that's the last person I would like to

2169.359 --> 2176.68
have joined a party well no no that no

2172.48 --> 2180.599
not the last but I don't know not

2176.68 --> 2180.5989999999997
somebody I'd love to put on that list

2181.24 --> 2187.54
I mean I'd have the rumpus over just for

2184.839 --> 2189.72
the opportunity to actually Sue who he

2187.54 --> 2189.72
is

2195.16 --> 2198.8999999999996
but Brenda no

2207.54 --> 2211.619
yo what's going on

2225.76 --> 2229.8390000000004
yeah that's what I was thinking tiny

2227.74 --> 2231.9399999999996
Womble but apparently everybody didn't

2229.839 --> 2235.599
feel like saying anything for five

2231.94 --> 2237.64
minutes straight all of a sudden

2235.599 --> 2240.04
yeah

2237.64 --> 2242.46
yeah I actually just refreshed my

2240.04 --> 2242.46
browser

2242.8 --> 2245.4
weird

2256.24 --> 2259.0789999999997
no but

2259.78 --> 2265.42
catered or do we need to bring food dude

2262.48 --> 2268.66
if I'm gonna have a party

2265.42 --> 2271.359
oh [ __ ] uh

2268.66 --> 2274.1189999999997
it depends on how big if dude if it's

2271.359 --> 2277.0
just like 10 guys and girls whatever

2274.119 --> 2278.2000000000003
over then I'm definitely gonna make the

2277.0 --> 2280.66
food myself

2278.2 --> 2282.2799999999997
I'm not gonna

2280.66 --> 2284.7999999999997
come on

2282.28 --> 2286.0
I've been bragging so much about my

2284.8 --> 2289.96
cooking

2286.0 --> 2292.78
and it is excellent it is that yeah it

2289.96 --> 2294.359
would be crazy not to actually

2292.78 --> 2297.1600000000003
prove that

2294.359 --> 2301.2599999999998
so I'd definitely be doing doing the

2297.16 --> 2301.2599999999998
cooking myself the day before

2317.26 --> 2322.2000000000003
and say Vegan Alternatives gluten-free

2321.04 --> 2325.599
dishes

2322.2 --> 2327.2799999999997
gluten-free dude that's the one thing I

2325.599 --> 2329.98
really don't know how to deal with it

2327.28 --> 2332.8590000000004
like I I really don't know how how to

2329.98 --> 2335.52
make gluten-free stuff I don't I just

2332.859 --> 2339.7
don't it's like nothing

2335.52 --> 2342.48
works I mean I'm already like low gluten

2339.7 --> 2347.3199999999997
for example things like pasta and bread

2342.48 --> 2348.82
I get spelled based

2347.32 --> 2350.92
I insist

2348.82 --> 2353.1400000000003
right that's that's better but

2350.92 --> 2355.7400000000002
completely gluten free I don't know how

2353.14 --> 2358.2999999999997
to do that at all but yes vegan sure

2355.74 --> 2360.4599999999996
there's plenty of things

2358.3 --> 2362.5600000000004
used to make it with meat and then I

2360.46 --> 2363.7
stopped using it with meat and then it's

2362.56 --> 2367.54
vegan

2363.7 --> 2370.0
so I could make spaghetti that's vegan

2367.54 --> 2373.119
and

2370.0 --> 2375.94
oh yeah and then another dish

2373.119 --> 2379.2000000000003
with meat right I probably

2375.94 --> 2379.2000000000003
try to make some

2379.359 --> 2384.88
my chicken ketchup

2381.94 --> 2387.88
I might well sort of Indonesian style

2384.88 --> 2387.88
rice

2388.3 --> 2392.3390000000004
and then something vegan on the side

2393.339 --> 2398.52
like spaghetti I don't know

2395.619 --> 2398.52
I'm getting hungry

2400.66 --> 2405.8999999999996
August 29th really

2403.24 --> 2405.8999999999996
huh

2415.72 --> 2423.339
right well you know what

2418.72 --> 2426.819
I guess I'll since you both touch sailor

2423.339 --> 2431.38
and I kill the hope are in my chat

2426.819 --> 2434.56
I'll actually do it any Dutch guy that I

2431.38 --> 2438.0
know from chat Argyle

2434.56 --> 2438.0
they they can come over

2442.9 --> 2447.88
maybe that's a yeah unless there's like

2445.72 --> 2451.18
20 people gonna show up

2447.88 --> 2455.04
that I yeah that 18 of them I've never

2451.18 --> 2455.04
I've never seen or 17.

2455.44 --> 2459.18
that would be a little bit much

2459.88 --> 2465.819
but let's just say that you two guys

2462.64 --> 2468.2799999999997
would come over that would be great

2465.819 --> 2473.339
and it wouldn't be really a party it

2468.28 --> 2473.3390000000004
would be just like a micro meet up

2476.44 --> 2481.9
but that's very doable for cooking

2479.859 --> 2485.0989999999997
a plus one

2481.9 --> 2485.099
yeah sure why not

2499.66 --> 2506.339
but yeah if you have specific

2502.319 --> 2509.2
gluten-free dietary needs

2506.339 --> 2512.5
then yeah

2509.2 --> 2515.3999999999996
then you might need to get yeah your own

2512.5 --> 2515.4
food for that

2519.099 --> 2525.46
what gluten-free right

2522.099 --> 2528.52
well if you're gluten free and not vegan

2525.46 --> 2530.92
then it would be doable because yeah I

2528.52 --> 2533.74
don't think rice

2530.92 --> 2534.64
and all that yeah there's no gluten in

2533.74 --> 2536.6189999999997
that

2534.64 --> 2539.44
should be

2536.619 --> 2542.859
although

2539.44 --> 2547.2000000000003
it's really tough to get gluten-free

2542.859 --> 2547.2
it's on a Sunday okay cool

2561.52 --> 2565.44
all right well what I could do

2569.14 --> 2574.18
look if anybody's really planning to

2571.48 --> 2576.339
come over it would be best if you

2574.18 --> 2578.319
literally let me know and get my phone

2576.339 --> 2581.0789999999997
number and stuff

2578.319 --> 2583.599
right and then we could talk about it

2581.079 --> 2587.02
if you plan to show up and what your

2583.599 --> 2589.2400000000002
dietary needs are so I can like way

2587.02 --> 2592.06
ahead of time if possible

2589.24 --> 2595.68
like at least a couple of days so I can

2592.06 --> 2595.68
spend an entire day on cooking

2596.98 --> 2602.94
with

2598.54 --> 2602.94
foresight on Who's Gonna Come

2611.98 --> 2616.839
my phone number is already on the

2614.44 --> 2620.5

every day

2772.52 --> 2775.699
[Music]

2778.48 --> 2783.16
from the episode when the police knocked

2780.579 --> 2785.8
during the show right

2783.16 --> 2787.0
that was an epic show dude that was a

2785.8 --> 2789.1600000000003
crazy show

2787.0 --> 2791.38
I was completely berserking like a

2789.16 --> 2793.0
maniac

2791.38 --> 2797.099
well not yeah

2793.0 --> 2797.099
I was rage win

2797.319 --> 2802.1
you think that's Epic

2800.56 --> 2805.2599999999998
really

2802.1 --> 2805.2599999999998
[Music]

2812.22 --> 2815.3199999999997
[Music]

2825.96 --> 2832.319
hmm yeah Zach hello by the way yeah good

2829.48 --> 2832.319
servants right there

2835.66 --> 2840.66
he's right here in chat

2837.94 --> 2840.66
how are you doing

2849.87 --> 2853.179
[Music]

2869.559 --> 2875.7000000000003
right oh by the way that flat photo

2873.099 --> 2875.7000000000003
like

2878.14 --> 2883.0589999999997
yeah they knocked on the door

2880.359 --> 2885.5989999999997
it was just because I was loud like a

2883.059 --> 2885.599
crazy guy

2887.98 --> 2894.16
ranting and raving

2890.74 --> 2895.9599999999996
apparently nothing else I talk about

2894.16 --> 2899.2599999999998
is really

2895.96 --> 2901.599
of any concern to them

2899.26 --> 2904.96
nobody seems to be worried for my

2901.599 --> 2907.559
opinions at all except for Ballers but

2904.96 --> 2907.559
that's different

2919.66 --> 2926.2
but for example I haven't even had any

2922.96 --> 2929.46
kind of a signal

2926.2 --> 2929.46
not one

2930.04 --> 2936.64
anybody else that is like dude why are

2934.54 --> 2939.22
you so intolerant

2936.64 --> 2943.44
nobody

2939.22 --> 2943.4399999999996
not a single person here

2944.88 --> 2953.099
is worried about my intolerant attitude

2949.9 --> 2953.099
not a single person

2953.74 --> 2958.24
and that's one thing that really

2956.02 --> 2960.4
surprised me because I thought that as

2958.24 --> 2963.7
soon as I'd open up that can and I

2960.4 --> 2965.98
started opening it up some time ago very

2963.7 --> 2969.16
carefully because it was scared as [ __ ]

2965.98 --> 2971.92
when it first started to basically get

2969.16 --> 2974.14
honest about that

2971.92 --> 2976.66
scared as [ __ ] that I was literally just

2974.14 --> 2979.1189999999997
going to have people constantly nagging

2976.66 --> 2980.6189999999997
me getting in my way not because I'm a

2979.119 --> 2985.319
flat earther

2980.619 --> 2985.319
but because I'm I don't know homophobic

2986.8 --> 2994.1800000000003
I am sort of sexist

2991.3 --> 2998.52
all these Common Sense things right was

2994.18 --> 2998.52
biblical based things

2999.22 --> 3003.7799999999997
nobody seems to really

3001.98 --> 3006.559
care

3003.78 --> 3006.559
at all

3018.599 --> 3025.28
apparently I was the only one that

3020.819 --> 3025.2799999999997
really cared about such things

3034.5 --> 3040.38
or maybe everybody out here is ignoring

3037.74 --> 3043.2599999999998
me because they already think that they

3040.38 --> 3045.96
have completely won and nothing that I

3043.26 --> 3048.1800000000003
say could change anything

3045.96 --> 3050.339
and that's why they're leaving me alone

3048.18 --> 3052.5789999999997
I don't know I've never been sure about

3050.339 --> 3052.5789999999997
it

3056.4 --> 3062.76
I've never not a single time out there

3060.24 --> 3066.4199999999996
and I go out for groceries at least

3062.76 --> 3069.42
every day people know where I'm at in

3066.42 --> 3072.1800000000003
the certain periods of the day

3069.42 --> 3075.42
I'm very cyclical like that nobody has

3072.18 --> 3079.2599999999998
ever addressed me like oh you are

3075.42 --> 3081.6800000000003
that racist or that flat earther no not

3079.26 --> 3081.6800000000003
even that

3084.48 --> 3089.94
nothing I do get strange looks sometimes

3087.66 --> 3094.0989999999997
but yeah

3089.94 --> 3094.099
Gammas looks strange at everybody

3095.819 --> 3098.42
anyway

3110.42 --> 3114.42
you uh

3126.66 --> 3132.68
mm-hmm

3128.7 --> 3132.68
oh did anybody catch my

3133.44 --> 3137.76
video link good servant did you see it

3136.319 --> 3140.4
in Skype

3137.76 --> 3143.1600000000003
my early bird chat

3140.4 --> 3145.64
at the ultimate

3143.16 --> 3148.44
like symbol

3145.64 --> 3152.66
analogy of

3148.44 --> 3152.66
like a ball Zealot response

3153.3 --> 3160.2200000000003
to a flat Earth or a bottle

3156.3 --> 3160.2200000000003
did anybody catch that in chat

3169.619 --> 3174.559
it's some Twitter

3172.079 --> 3174.559
thing

3189.18 --> 3194.0989999999997
hey it's 78012 yeah dude I I told

3192.3 --> 3195.8390000000004
everybody yesterday

3194.099 --> 3200.059
that's

3195.839 --> 3200.0589999999997
of course I'm gonna be better today

3200.76 --> 3206.099
and I feel a lot better maybe I feel

3203.28 --> 3207.7200000000003
even better than before yesterday

3206.099 --> 3211.44
because

3207.72 --> 3214.5789999999997
that halfway crash yesterday it did kind

3211.44 --> 3218.119
of like empty the bucket

3214.579 --> 3218.119
backdrop feelings

3221.7 --> 3226.5589999999997
so I feel more cleared up

3223.98 --> 3230.099
and I feel also I'm a lot more fluid

3226.559 --> 3233.119
right now than I have been

3230.099 --> 3233.119
last few days

3239.52 --> 3245.119
November 8th 2018 first episode

3246.119 --> 3249.98
early bird show episode right

3256.2 --> 3261.0789999999997
was about l b g b t

3265.14 --> 3271.6189999999997
that was yesterday somebody got in there

3268.14 --> 3274.6189999999997
and actually was like a full

3271.619 --> 3274.619
lgbtqer

3274.859 --> 3279.0
but I wasn't had such a headache I

3277.26 --> 3281.8390000000004
couldn't even make out whether they were

3279.0 --> 3281.839
serious or not

3282.119 --> 3287.2400000000002
that was yesterday was so weird in chat

3291.0 --> 3296.24
ah flat fellow yeah yeah oh those were

3293.76 --> 3296.2400000000002
the good days

3324.839 --> 3329.66
mm-hmm

3326.22 --> 3329.66
I was still so

3329.94 --> 3338.94
weird back then though you know

3334.38 --> 3341.7000000000003
I've adapted a lot since then

3338.94 --> 3344.819
really grown into like skill ranges

3341.7 --> 3348.54
socializing and communication

3344.819 --> 3351.48
and science like a lot of it I love so

3348.54 --> 3354.839
much more about science than I do

3351.48 --> 3356.819
yeah during that time those years ago

3354.839 --> 3359.2799999999997
just the whole thing the way of thinking

3356.819 --> 3362.22
and seeing is different now because back

3359.28 --> 3365.52
then I was just much more like oh I have

3362.22 --> 3367.2
this unique idea I feel there's a lot of

3365.52 --> 3369.42
connection

3367.2 --> 3372.24
it was much more concerned about like

3369.42 --> 3374.28
ideas for the future and keeping that

3372.24 --> 3376.6189999999997
together

3374.28 --> 3378.6600000000003
that's what I was doing a lot at the

3376.619 --> 3381.359
beginning of the channel I started out

3378.66 --> 3384.6189999999997
my channel I guess like oh here are all

3381.359 --> 3387.66
the potential models like all of it

3384.619 --> 3389.339
anything I could think of like oh yeah

3387.66 --> 3391.74
here's the rectangular looping earth oh

3389.339 --> 3394.859
yeah holographic Sun uh just

3391.74 --> 3397.5589999999997
hello that's my first R win episode

3394.859 --> 3400.0989999999997
on this channel years and years and

3397.559 --> 3400.099
years ago

3401.16 --> 3406.5789999999997
I'm still amazed about about that

3419.22 --> 3424.0989999999997
they are going to get every no no good

3421.799 --> 3424.099
seven

3425.4 --> 3431.94
they're gonna seduce everyone to do it

3428.819 --> 3433.44
try to buy them off with lollipops for

3431.94 --> 3438.42
sure

3433.44 --> 3441.54
but yeah when they force it as in get

3438.42 --> 3444.42
two homes hold down people inject yeah

3441.54 --> 3446.64
that's Civil War time that's just not

3444.42 --> 3450.6800000000003
gonna happen

3446.64 --> 3450.68
in the U.S there's no way

3453.299 --> 3459.359
but they will take every lollipop

3456.599 --> 3460.7400000000002
they'll craft new lollipops just to hold

3459.359 --> 3461.88
over your head and make you get a

3460.74 --> 3464.299
vaccination

3461.88 --> 3464.299
okay

3465.059 --> 3471.26
the seduction will be maximized in the

3468.48 --> 3471.26
U.S for sure

3471.78 --> 3479.119
they can't make you take it

3476.04 --> 3479.119
can only seduce

3481.02 --> 3486.0
right

3482.7 --> 3489.5589999999997
activate something what what are they

3486.0 --> 3489.559
going to activate good servant

3489.599 --> 3493.92
what's gonna happen what you think that

3492.119 --> 3496.5
everybody that's taking a vax is

3493.92 --> 3499.319
suddenly gonna turn into an arc

3496.5 --> 3500.52
and then start butchering up people in

3499.319 --> 3504.98
an army

3500.52 --> 3504.98
like what what are you thinking about

3519.0 --> 3524.16
hunt us down when the time comes well

3521.28 --> 3525.599
yeah that's fine like every individual

3524.16 --> 3529.14
that does that

3525.599 --> 3531.8590000000004
is going to have a very very high chance

3529.14 --> 3531.859
of dying

3532.14 --> 3536.5789999999997
like

3534.54 --> 3538.68
by the time that they're gonna go for

3536.579 --> 3542.76
that how many how many people you think

3538.68 --> 3544.5589999999997
are just gonna be surprised right

3542.76 --> 3547.44
not a lot

3544.559 --> 3549.3590000000004
so yeah it's like oh oh you're like a

3547.44 --> 3553.619
SWAT team and you only have to take down

3549.359 --> 3555.9
like 10 000 people yeah guess what

3553.619 --> 3557.819
for such a cause it's almost a

3555.9 --> 3559.799
guaranteed death you don't even have to

3557.819 --> 3562.619
be in a country where arms are allowed

3559.799 --> 3564.78
at some point people are gonna just like

3562.619 --> 3567.9
make traps and [ __ ] just like you're

3564.78 --> 3570.48
gonna get killed for such an action

3567.9 --> 3573.48
they don't have the manpower to do

3570.48 --> 3575.54
something like that they don't have a

3573.48 --> 3578.28
giant

3575.54 --> 3580.44
blood-stained Nazi army that's already

3578.28 --> 3583.02
slaughtered millions and millions of

3580.44 --> 3585.9
people blatantly

3583.02 --> 3589.4
that will just do that that will just go

3585.9 --> 3589.4
into death to do that no

3596.819 --> 3604.319
I don't it's not gonna happen

3600.119 --> 3607.38
there's no point in in having it built

3604.319 --> 3610.92
up in this fashion to make everything

3607.38 --> 3614.52
about seduction everything like no

3610.92 --> 3617.46
mandate and anything entire systems

3614.52 --> 3620.7
corporate systems government systems

3617.46 --> 3623.7
built to account for this voluntary

3620.7 --> 3625.98
system using lollipops to hang over your

3623.7 --> 3628.4399999999996
head and seduce you right you think

3625.98 --> 3631.26
they're going to build all of that

3628.44 --> 3633.599
just to at some point suddenly start

3631.26 --> 3636.42
rolling out troops and just forcing it

3633.599 --> 3637.8590000000004
like a civil war scenario that makes no

3636.42 --> 3640.079
sense

3637.859 --> 3642.0589999999997
why did would I have put in so much

3640.079 --> 3645.54
effort into

3642.059 --> 3647.579
into lollipop infrastructure for this

3645.54 --> 3649.859
makes no sense

3647.579 --> 3651.2400000000002
I don't think it's gonna happen I don't

3649.859 --> 3654.119
think they will

3651.24 --> 3656.4599999999996
at anybody out there is going to get to

3654.119 --> 3658.859
that point

3656.46 --> 3661.44
right if it's gonna happen then it's

3658.859 --> 3665.16
gonna happen after a giant World War

3661.44 --> 3667.559
breakout scenario like literally so is

3665.16 --> 3670.0789999999997
subtly a country with giant military

3667.559 --> 3673.44
force starts like bombing the [ __ ] out

3670.079 --> 3675.8390000000004
of a a place totally out of nowhere and

3673.44 --> 3677.88
like really [ __ ] Breaks Loose then of

3675.839 --> 3682.44
course military start to rise everywhere

3677.88 --> 3685.38
and then maybe like suddenly

3682.44 --> 3687.599
they'll make people they'll force it on

3685.38 --> 3689.88
people right because there's already a

3687.599 --> 3692.46
freaking world war breaking out yeah

3689.88 --> 3697.5
that could happen as long as that's not

3692.46 --> 3699.299
happening there is no way no way it'll

3697.5 --> 3702.599
ever get to a point where they're gonna

3699.299 --> 3704.9
force you to take it and not under some

3702.599 --> 3704.9
condition

3705.24 --> 3712.5589999999997
not on a seduction based system

3708.059 --> 3715.559
there's no way it's absolutely no way

3712.559 --> 3717.8390000000004
because if you do that

3715.559 --> 3722.299
as long as there's not some giant World

3717.839 --> 3727.64
War breaking out you are effectively

3722.299 --> 3727.64
constitutionally starting a civil war

3727.859 --> 3738.18
you cannot force it you can not force it

3733.859 --> 3741.38
it is the most illegal thing imaginable

3738.18 --> 3745.319
in this world do you understand it is

3741.38 --> 3748.7400000000002
incredibly illegal Nuremberg executably

3745.319 --> 3751.619
illegal it is the most illegal thing you

3748.74 --> 3754.5
could do you can never force it on

3751.619 --> 3760.02
people you understand

3754.5 --> 3763.079
only super extreme War situations could

3760.02 --> 3765.119
somehow spur forth such actions only

3763.079 --> 3769.02
that it's the only thing I can imagine

3765.119 --> 3772.26
that could make such a thing unfold

3769.02 --> 3774.9
because it is definitely Equitable to

3772.26 --> 3775.92
genocidal actions it's like what's the

3774.9 --> 3778.26
difference

3775.92 --> 3780.7200000000003
between injecting

3778.26 --> 3782.6400000000003
Gene altering chemicals into people

3780.72 --> 3785.16
forcibly not giving them a choice

3782.64 --> 3787.3799999999997
cornering them maybe starving them out

3785.16 --> 3790.02
and just running in bashing in and just

3787.38 --> 3792.6600000000003
doing it on them what's the difference

3790.02 --> 3795.48
between that and going door by door and

3792.66 --> 3797.3999999999996
just like shooting people what's the

3795.48 --> 3799.76
difference there's very little

3797.4 --> 3799.76
difference

3799.799 --> 3805.319
so you gotta put it on that level when

3803.16 --> 3809.3999999999996
does do such things happen

3805.319 --> 3812.7
when big [ __ ] War breaks out the

3809.4 --> 3814.7000000000003
world destabilizes and suddenly safety

3812.7 --> 3819.1189999999997
cannot be guaranteed because military

3814.7 --> 3821.339
people will be preoccupied with war and

3819.119 --> 3825.359
then they pull that sort of [ __ ] and

3821.339 --> 3828.9
that's the only time ever that they pull

3825.359 --> 3831.7799999999997
such [ __ ] they cannot do it otherwise

3828.9 --> 3835.619
not without literally overtly starting a

3831.78 --> 3838.579
civil war that will happen

3835.619 --> 3838.579
if you do that

3838.92 --> 3844.7000000000003
don't be afraid

3841.14 --> 3844.7
do not be afraid

3849.539 --> 3854.46
dude a lot of the people of the New

3852.42 --> 3857.2200000000003
World Order and [ __ ]

3854.46 --> 3859.5
especially their communist arms that are

3857.22 --> 3862.14
doing a lot of garbage out there

3859.5 --> 3864.96
who you think's gonna fall the first

3862.14 --> 3868.52
when when absolute War breaks out right

3864.96 --> 3868.52
it's pretty much conditional

3868.559 --> 3873.119
for them to stay in power that such a

3871.319 --> 3875.7599999999998
thing don't doesn't happen

3873.119 --> 3879.539
because as soon as it's done that does

3875.76 --> 3882.0
happen all these Communists and [ __ ] all

3879.539 --> 3884.76
these rainbow flag Weavers and the

3882.0 --> 3885.96
antifa groups and BLM and all that

3884.76 --> 3889.079
garbage

3885.96 --> 3891.42
what do you think's gonna go the first

3889.079 --> 3894.3590000000004
right

3891.42 --> 3896.46
when [ __ ] changes in the house what you

3894.359 --> 3899.88
gonna do you're gonna take out the

3896.46 --> 3900.96
garbage first to make room yeah that's

3899.88 --> 3903.9
gonna happen

3900.96 --> 3906.66
right so these people that are now in

3903.9 --> 3909.059
control sort of in control of our media

3906.66 --> 3911.5789999999997
and our minds the propaganda they have

3909.059 --> 3915.299
the narrative behind them yeah

3911.579 --> 3917.2200000000003
it's in their interest to prevent a

3915.299 --> 3920.22
giant World War from breaking out

3917.22 --> 3922.64
because they are the first to go when

3920.22 --> 3922.64
that happens

3923.0 --> 3931.74
do not be afraid of genocide suddenly

3927.9 --> 3934.2200000000003
happening like that facts or at the

3931.74 --> 3934.22
gunpoint

3934.619 --> 3938.6600000000003
do not be afraid

3957.24 --> 3960.9599999999996
right well a good surface is not gonna

3959.099 --> 3964.1400000000003
happen

3960.96 --> 3967.5
don't be paranoid don't let the fear

3964.14 --> 3969.72
spell get to you get real listen to

3967.5 --> 3973.46
everything I just said

3969.72 --> 3973.4599999999996
I'm talking about for five minutes

3973.74 --> 3978.4799999999996
if you if you somehow had your ears

3976.319 --> 3981.48
plugged because your mind distracted you

3978.48 --> 3983.339
listen back listen back again to the

3981.48 --> 3984.96
whole thing I just been I've just been

3983.339 --> 3987.92
talking about

3984.96 --> 3987.92
it's very serious

3993.539 --> 4001.1600000000003
yeah well good servant why why don't you

3996.059 --> 4004.6400000000003
stop being obsessed with that yeah

4001.16 --> 4007.64
you know what that is that's

4004.64 --> 4007.64
basically

4007.819 --> 4014.599
longing that's ariman you are engaging

4011.42 --> 4018.2200000000003
in longing for ariman

4014.599 --> 4018.2200000000003
Doom don't do it

4025.579 --> 4031.2200000000003
yeah well you are in fear good servant

4028.819 --> 4034.22
if you think that if that is on your

4031.22 --> 4036.68
mind you are in fear because those

4034.22 --> 4040.0989999999997
thoughts are fear-based

4036.68 --> 4042.319
yeah you can ignore your fear that

4040.099 --> 4045.26
doesn't mean it's not there because it

4042.319 --> 4048.079
is there it's there through your train

4045.26 --> 4048.92
of thought and I've already described to

4048.079 --> 4052.099
you

4048.92 --> 4055.52
why that won't happen

4052.099 --> 4059.079
yet your fear seems to make you ignore

4055.52 --> 4059.079
it that's what fear does

4060.559 --> 4067.039
and then

4062.359 --> 4068.96
try to say like you don't well you do

4067.039 --> 4072.1400000000003
because you're you're still thinking

4068.96 --> 4075.319
about it you're still having a train of

4072.14 --> 4077.5989999999997
thought based off fear and not further

4075.319 --> 4080.079
develop not reflecting further on

4077.599 --> 4080.079
reality

4082.099 --> 4088.1800000000003
if you had no fear then you would have

4084.619 --> 4090.44
moved on with your thoughts beyond that

4088.18 --> 4092.72
letting it to rest because you know

4090.44 --> 4095.2400000000002
that's not gonna happen

4092.72 --> 4098.3589999999995
and even if it would which it won't then

4095.24 --> 4100.159
it wouldn't be relevant to worry about

4098.359 --> 4103.6
it ahead of time

4100.159 --> 4103.599999999999
is completely pointless

4117.02 --> 4121.159000000001
they've given a choice between jab or

4119.779 --> 4123.6990000000005
death

4121.159 --> 4123.699
oh

4124.46 --> 4127.659
that's not the choice

4132.14 --> 4138.319
that choice is your death or their death

4135.92 --> 4142.2390000000005
right you're get you're already creating

4138.319 --> 4142.2390000000005
a false dichotomy just for yourself

4146.42 --> 4149.319
foreign

4156.92 --> 4163.339
's feet on fear indeed

4160.4 --> 4166.639999999999
or feed they build on it

4163.339 --> 4169.239
they rely on it for its predictable

4166.64 --> 4169.2390000000005
nature

4211.159 --> 4213.339999999999
foreign

4217.47 --> 4221.35
[Music]

4277.64 --> 4285.64
right so yeah just don't be afraid

4282.44 --> 4285.639999999999
those things are not gonna happen

4287.0 --> 4291.14
and even if they would and this is

4289.1 --> 4296.08
important to keep in mind even if they

4291.14 --> 4296.08
would it's no use worrying about it

4305.63 --> 4308.77
[Music]

4321.62 --> 4327.58
do they have an army of souls that

4323.96 --> 4327.58
already given consent yes

4341.42 --> 4345.14
right

4342.56 --> 4346.34
yes getting wisdom and hey when you take

4345.14 --> 4350.780000000001
the facts

4346.34 --> 4353.5
it does weaken you and weakens

4350.78 --> 4353.5
your spirit

4353.659 --> 4357.799999999999
and that's by the way with pretty much

4355.219 --> 4361.28
any vaccine

4357.8 --> 4364.04
but these ones especially

4361.28 --> 4366.86
so at some point if you take it and then

4364.04 --> 4370.4
you keep taking it then you're literally

4366.86 --> 4373.46
going to just lose

4370.4 --> 4376.46
medical control over yourself you're

4373.46 --> 4379.46
gonna lose the that that responsibility

4376.46 --> 4381.86
that instinct your responsibility

4379.46 --> 4385.46
to keep medical oversight on yourself

4381.86 --> 4388.04
because it's too much chaos too much

4385.46 --> 4390.92
doubling down

4388.04 --> 4393.38
and then at some point it yeah you'll

4390.92 --> 4396.5
get to the mindset like yeah okay I'll

4393.38 --> 4398.06
just take it until I die right that's

4396.5 --> 4400.52
the nightmare that's the nightmare

4398.06 --> 4402.26
that's gonna happen for some people they

4400.52 --> 4404.719
just will give up and they'll just say

4402.26 --> 4407.3
okay I don't care anymore I'll just take

4404.719 --> 4409.58
whatever they say I need to have

4407.3 --> 4413.360000000001
whatever tells somebody tells me to take

4409.58 --> 4415.82
it and I'll keep taking it until I die

4413.36 --> 4418.12
there will be these people and they will

4415.82 --> 4418.12
die

4420.26 --> 4424.0
quicker that is

4432.86 --> 4440.48
boost is down goods why in God's name

4437.06 --> 4444.02
would you even call it a booster dude

4440.48 --> 4446.419999999999
good servant why would you call it a

4444.02 --> 4447.8
booster it has nothing to do with that

4446.42 --> 4451.42
at all

4447.8 --> 4451.42
there is no booster

4451.699 --> 4459.32
right that's based the the freaking use

4455.54 --> 4464.54
of it is based on vaccination

4459.32 --> 4467.5599999999995
how there is no booster for freaking

4464.54 --> 4467.56
gene therapy

4467.679 --> 4473.32
why use their lingo

4475.58 --> 4481.699
it's not a booster it has nothing to it

4478.219 --> 4483.14
doesn't boost anything it's just another

4481.699 --> 4488.739
shot

4483.14 --> 4488.7390000000005
it's not a booster there is no booster

4504.199 --> 4508.699
you have a Tony Whitcomb it doesn't

4506.179 --> 4511.28
matter trial it's not a vax it's not

4508.699 --> 4513.759999999999
even vaccine technology it has nothing

4511.28 --> 4515.78
to do with it it's purely a new

4513.76 --> 4520.4800000000005
experimental thing

4515.78 --> 4520.48
that does not relate to vaccination

4526.34 --> 4531.9800000000005
yeah and they're using it

4528.98 --> 4535.159
the public as experimental trials for

4531.98 --> 4537.919999999999
this but dude the whole thing it hasn't

4535.159 --> 4540.98
even been developed to actually cure

4537.92 --> 4547.1
something like that's not in the design

4540.98 --> 4547.099999999999
of it it's pure wild experimentation

4549.86 --> 4555.04
it's not intended to give a better

4552.92 --> 4559.9400000000005
outcome for the people that take it okay

4555.04 --> 4560.739
it's a wild experiment not like oh this

4559.94 --> 4563.36
is

4560.739 --> 4566.0
unimaginably new thought out like oh

4563.36 --> 4569.0
they are going to nanotech things or

4566.0 --> 4573.14
whatever to potentially hopefully make

4569.0 --> 4577.28
it a better person no no that's not what

4573.14 --> 4580.280000000001
this is It's a wild experiment wild

4577.28 --> 4582.86
experiments means whoa dude we found

4580.28 --> 4587.3
something totally new

4582.86 --> 4589.82
okay let's let's just inject it in these

4587.3 --> 4592.64
things and see what happens because we

4589.82 --> 4596.96
don't know it's all new

4592.64 --> 4600.5
yeah they don't even have a plan

4596.96 --> 4603.92
an end result in mind that would

4600.5 --> 4605.179
actually benefit the one taking it in

4603.92 --> 4609.86
any way

4605.179 --> 4611.9800000000005
wild experiment wild experiment do you

4609.86 --> 4611.98
understand

4621.08 --> 4627.4
instead why the mainstream yeah renamed

4623.3 --> 4627.400000000001
it the jab yeah just for legal reasons

4628.76 --> 4634.400000000001
because a jab is just like yeah it's

4631.1 --> 4636.92
just a needle with stuff and they Ram it

4634.4 --> 4639.799999999999
in you that's can be anything so they

4636.92 --> 4641.9
just call it a jab yeah

4639.8 --> 4643.76
it's very sensible of them to adapt

4641.9 --> 4647.12
their lingo to that because they were

4643.76 --> 4649.52
technically blatantly wrong and I bet

4647.12 --> 4651.5599999999995
that a whole bunch of doctors in the

4649.52 --> 4654.7390000000005
system that were not fully satanic

4651.56 --> 4656.6
caught note of it and basically started

4654.739 --> 4658.159
to become alternative researchers

4656.6 --> 4662.6
because of it

4658.159 --> 4666.379999999999
because it was so blatantly wrong

4662.6 --> 4669.76
it woke up quite a few doctors

4666.38 --> 4669.76
and I guess that's good

4669.86 --> 4675.32
but now yeah they have to adapt it

4672.92 --> 4679.159
because it is not a vaccine it has

4675.32 --> 4681.62
nothing to do with that whatsoever

4679.159 --> 4685.42
it's not it's not even actually

4681.62 --> 4690.0199999999995
pretending to be that it's just a wild

4685.42 --> 4693.679
experiment wild genetic engineering

4690.02 --> 4697.400000000001
trial experiment not not a planned

4693.679 --> 4699.62
experiment with a end result in mind to

4697.4 --> 4702.44
benefit the participants

4699.62 --> 4706.78
that's not they're not even there

4702.44 --> 4710.0599999999995
if they could get there it's just wild

4706.78 --> 4712.4
experiment you understand

4710.06 --> 4715.120000000001
keep that in mind

4712.4 --> 4718.94
any sort of form of like oh but it's

4715.12 --> 4723.14
yeah it is the maximum possible

4718.94 --> 4725.54
Randomness there is no possible positive

4723.14 --> 4728.6
end result coming out of this experiment

4725.54 --> 4731.54
that's why I call it Wild

4728.6 --> 4735.34
right it's what makes it extra insane

4731.54 --> 4735.34
that this all is actually happening

4749.659 --> 4754.46
isolated

4751.76 --> 4758.9800000000005
how are you gonna isolate a body

4754.46 --> 4758.9800000000005
inherent mechanical response

4759.38 --> 4765.08
it's not an entity

4762.44 --> 4770.36
they're not entities they're not

4765.08 --> 4770.36
invading they're inanimate proteins

4770.6 --> 4777.620000000001
are enable whatever is that the exosomes

4774.92 --> 4781.04
they're just a part of the body

4777.62 --> 4784.159
they're inherent they're in your body at

4781.04 --> 4788.42
all times a percentage of them and they

4784.159 --> 4792.139999999999
activate and start to reproduce

4788.42 --> 4793.9400000000005
using dying cells to clean up [ __ ] when

4792.14 --> 4795.62
things get really bad that's what they

4793.94 --> 4799.419999999999
do

4795.62 --> 4802.96
you can't isolate it because everything

4799.42 --> 4802.96
every freaking

4803.32 --> 4810.92
flesh based organism at least maybe even

4806.179 --> 4814.6990000000005
plants too they all have it it like life

4810.92 --> 4817.9400000000005
wouldn't be able to continue if they

4814.699 --> 4819.5599999999995
didn't exist they're part of fundamental

4817.94 --> 4823.219
biochemistry

4819.56 --> 4825.4400000000005
just like bacteria they're part of the

4823.219 --> 4827.78
organism

4825.44 --> 4830.78
they're supposed to be there

4827.78 --> 4833.679
always because they have a function

4830.78 --> 4833.679
within the whole

4836.239 --> 4842.419999999999
right just compare it to

4839.239 --> 4843.98
you have a big city or like a or a

4842.42 --> 4846.7390000000005
country

4843.98 --> 4848.718999999999
you got all these garbage men right and

4846.739 --> 4850.5199999999995
these garbage men can probably get a

4848.719 --> 4852.02
little stinky every now and then well

4850.52 --> 4855.38
guess what's gonna happen when you

4852.02 --> 4856.88
remove all the garbage men

4855.38 --> 4858.9800000000005
all of them

4856.88 --> 4860.84
because they're stinky yeah guess what

4858.98 --> 4863.299999999999
all the garbage gotta pile up certainly

4860.84 --> 4866.96
uh yeah people are gonna get stinky

4863.3 --> 4870.26
right that's what they are that they're

4866.96 --> 4872.62
a part of the body Society they're part

4870.26 --> 4872.62
of you

4901.76 --> 4905.900000000001
yeah so every time somebody tells you

4904.04 --> 4908.54
it's never been isolated that's a straw

4905.9 --> 4912.0199999999995
man argument there is nothing to isolate

4908.54 --> 4915.679
you can't isolate that makes no sense

4912.02 --> 4919.179
it doesn't move on from person to person

4915.679 --> 4919.179
it activates

4919.4 --> 4925.159
from person to person doesn't jump it

4922.88 --> 4928.04
doesn't transport

4925.159 --> 4931.339999999999
a specific piece of matter

4928.04 --> 4933.98
from one person to the other creating

4931.34 --> 4937.219
the same condition sprouting forth from

4933.98 --> 4939.259999999999
that specific particle that doesn't

4937.219 --> 4943.0
happen

4939.26 --> 4943.0
that's not how it works

4949.46 --> 4952.06
uh

4959.36 --> 4964.12
there is no a in biochem that's

4961.639 --> 4964.12
hilarious

4964.76 --> 4967.54
uh

4968.0 --> 4974.719
you wait what are you talking about Good

4971.0 --> 4978.04
servant you you know biochemistry really

4974.719 --> 4978.04
I don't think so

4979.04 --> 4982.48
don't know where you're getting that

4980.239 --> 4982.48
from

4983.719 --> 4986.679
20 years ago

4990.26 --> 4996.92
but what were you doing then I mean you

4993.08 --> 5001.62
were studying to be a labyrinth

4996.92 --> 5001.62
and working in a laboratory like what

5012.639 --> 5015.179
okay

5051.4 --> 5057.28
okay well were you any good at it

5054.76 --> 5061.139
or you just went through it

5057.28 --> 5061.139
you're not an idiot no I

5063.82 --> 5066.54
I just

5066.88 --> 5073.92
well you had it right

5069.82 --> 5073.92
just like I had biology in school

5075.1 --> 5081.04
because you're not exactly a biochemist

5078.639 --> 5083.1990000000005
type right

5081.04 --> 5086.139
it's not like you throw around the

you have detailed insight

5093.04 --> 5096.9
basic stuff right okay

5097.0 --> 5101.8
right I thought you were literally

5099.159 --> 5104.32
claiming oh you are a biochemist you got

5101.8 --> 5106.6
an A in class okay well I haven't really

5104.32 --> 5109.12
seen that from you

5106.6 --> 5111.219
but yeah if you just did some basic

5109.12 --> 5114.699
stuff that

5111.219 --> 5117.52
doesn't exactly make you buy a chemist

5114.699 --> 5119.259999999999
by that standard I'm a biochemist I have

5117.52 --> 5121.84
like

5119.26 --> 5124.360000000001
known people that were doing that and

5121.84 --> 5127.92
then ask them stuff and like oh can I do

5124.36 --> 5127.92
something yeah sure

mean

5453.82 --> 5458.679
I didn't feel I really needed a reward

5457.0 --> 5461.32
for that it like

5458.679 --> 5463.4800000000005
I'm literally sorry that I had to stop I

5461.32 --> 5465.159
was really appreciating his plans and I

5463.48 --> 5468.48
think that it was Mutual

5465.159 --> 5468.48
his plans like me

5468.699 --> 5473.638999999999
they they grew significantly in that

5471.4 --> 5473.638999999999
week

5475.0 --> 5479.219

5773.76 --> 5779.46
Americans were super people

5776.92 --> 5779.46
huh

5786.639 --> 5793.7390000000005
well they can be

5790.3 --> 5797.320000000001
if they are not utterly seduced by

5793.739 --> 5800.339999999999
Lucifer in many ways

5797.32 --> 5803.799999999999
but yeah Americans in my opinion do have

5800.34 --> 5805.719
pretty super badass potential it's just

5803.8 --> 5809.400000000001
that yeah

5805.719 --> 5809.4
is that potential coming through

5811.659 --> 5818.159
because the yeah the whole system is

5814.239 --> 5818.159
completely plagued by devils

it's a Yankee Prof again is it

5858.48 --> 5864.5199999999995

5901.9 --> 5907.54
how weird is it that you've actually

5904.42 --> 5912.42
been spreading neo-communism

no he just shows you how to do it

5958.96 --> 5962.159
are you free of sin

5962.5 --> 5967.9
really it's like oh yeah that that guy a

5965.619 --> 5970.78
thousand year two thousand years ago he

5967.9 --> 5973.54
did something and because of that for

5970.78 --> 5975.88
over 50 Generations or more we don't

5973.54 --> 5979.06
know what sin is it doesn't exist right

5975.88 --> 5981.58
it's this myth about Sin and no no I'm

5979.06 --> 5985.26
pretty sure that sin is still there

5981.58 --> 5985.26
yeah it's still there

5985.6 --> 5991.2390000000005
you still have to deal with it

5988.119 --> 5993.699
life wouldn't be life without you having

5991.239 --> 5996.599999999999
to deal with it

5993.699 --> 5996.599999999999

6023.28 --> 6027.0199999999995
it's weird to call them your creator

6028.5 --> 6031.28
but

6031.86 --> 6039.0
yeah leader sure he's the best of us

6035.219 --> 6042.92
great example how to do it

6039.0 --> 6042.92
how to stay clear of sin

6043.08 --> 6048.98
but that doesn't mean that it's gone

6046.38 --> 6052.1990000000005
yeah he didn't take that away

6048.98 --> 6053.339999999999
mechanically of the universe yeah he

6052.199 --> 6058.98
didn't do that

6053.34 --> 6062.639
he just show you how you can do that

6058.98 --> 6063.959999999999
where before people were very easily

6062.639 --> 6067.38
distracted

6063.96 --> 6071.04
by priesthood garbage indoctrination

6067.38 --> 6074.159000000001
and they'd be bound to believe that you

6071.04 --> 6077.6
have to sacrifice one to whatever in

6074.159 --> 6082.339999999999
order to achieve something right

6077.6 --> 6082.34
that was the point that was the change

6082.98 --> 6089.159
didn't take sin away that garbage still

6086.639 --> 6094.58
exists it's just that now there is

6089.159 --> 6094.58
another example of how to stay clear

6094.739 --> 6099.86
that Insight exists now thanks to Jesus

6097.679 --> 6099.86
Christ

6107.52 --> 6112.34
yeah

6108.9 --> 6112.339999999999
I get that good servant

6115.26 --> 6120.900000000001
but that doesn't mean that you are

6118.32 --> 6123.599999999999
without sin

6120.9 --> 6125.82
it just means you know how to actually

6123.6 --> 6129.900000000001
navigate

6125.82 --> 6132.179
in a way that you can avoid sin

6129.9 --> 6133.98
that's different and it doesn't make you

6132.179 --> 6136.4
entirely perfect

6133.98 --> 6136.4
either

6141.179 --> 6146.76
yeah no good servant no Trinity is

6144.42 --> 6149.88
[ __ ]

6146.76 --> 6151.56
it is [ __ ] it is [ __ ] it is

6149.88 --> 6153.4800000000005
[ __ ]

6151.56 --> 6155.34
an illogical standard it's complete

6153.48 --> 6157.759999999999
[ __ ] it's a riddle it doesn't make

6155.34 --> 6157.76
any sense

6157.98 --> 6162.839999999999
the Creator is the creator Jesus Christ

6160.02 --> 6165.3
is Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit

6162.84 --> 6169.159000000001
I don't know about that one

6165.3 --> 6169.159000000001
maybe it is another

6169.56 --> 6175.02
maybe it is

6171.6 --> 6179.2390000000005
what Christ became after death I don't

6175.02 --> 6179.2390000000005
know exactly there's something there

6180.54 --> 6186.6
but they are not one three are not one

6183.96 --> 6188.639
three are three one is one three or

6186.6 --> 6193.56
three one is one right

6188.639 --> 6196.679
let's not get into crazy math yeah

6193.56 --> 6198.9800000000005
three is not one one is one three is

6196.679 --> 6198.9800000000005
three

6204.119 --> 6208.82
and X is three and one no an egg is an

6206.639 --> 6208.82
egg

6209.04 --> 6214.639
and when it's an egg it's an egg

6212.34 --> 6220.26
and when it becomes

6214.639 --> 6223.139
yeah a little chicken it's a chicken

6220.26 --> 6225.119000000001
it's not three in one it's an egg it's

6223.139 --> 6227.04
one and then when it turns into a

6225.119 --> 6229.0199999999995
chicken it's a chicken and that's one

6227.04 --> 6231.3
chicken

6229.02 --> 6235.159000000001
yeah no three is not in one

6231.3 --> 6235.159000000001
one is one three is three

6235.199 --> 6241.799999999999
don't get me the stupid number riddles

6238.619 --> 6243.96
like don't do that I'll ban you if you

6241.8 --> 6246.7390000000005
continue that [ __ ] here

6243.96 --> 6249.96
don't shove your priesthood

6246.739 --> 6252.599999999999
indoctrination nonsense riddles

6249.96 --> 6254.78
in between my reasoning thank you very

6252.6 --> 6254.780000000001
much

6255.96 --> 6262.86
I utterly reject

6259.86 --> 6266.159
the the conceptions of the Trinity like

6262.86 --> 6269.4
that I utterly reject it

6266.159 --> 6271.679
one is one three is three and it all has

6269.4 --> 6274.679
a purpose

6271.679 --> 6277.08
what does not have a purpose however is

6274.679 --> 6279.119
to make three things and then equate

6277.08 --> 6283.32
them to a singular thing

6279.119 --> 6283.32
that is nonsense

6309.42 --> 6315.4800000000005
okay

6312.02 --> 6318.96
I think you uh

6315.48 --> 6322.0199999999995
had a slight vowel rotation issue there

6318.96 --> 6325.26
pretty sure it's with an O

6322.02 --> 6327.42
right but yeah father and son are not

6325.26 --> 6331.619000000001
one thing there's the father and there's

6327.42 --> 6334.56
the son they are not one thing

6331.619 --> 6336.48
and they don't become one thing one is

6334.56 --> 6338.159000000001
the father one is the Son and that's how

6336.48 --> 6340.44
it's always going to be nothing can

6338.159 --> 6342.799999999999
change that it makes no sense to suggest

6340.44 --> 6342.799999999999
that

6348.06 --> 6352.320000000001
it's just exoteric rambling that's what

6351.119 --> 6355.86
that is

6352.32 --> 6358.199
like you don't even know what it means

6355.86 --> 6361.5
well well you've been told what it means

6358.199 --> 6362.82
but how can you discern the logic from

6361.5 --> 6367.02
it right

6362.82 --> 6369.719
comparison of everything else you know

6367.02 --> 6371.820000000001
yeah when something when you compare it

6369.719 --> 6374.58
to everything else you know doesn't make

6371.82 --> 6377.78
any logical consistent sense

6374.58 --> 6377.78
it's wrong

6387.719 --> 6392.1
right that's how we figured out the

6390.239 --> 6394.98
Earth is actually flat and not a sphere

6392.1 --> 6398.639
remember that

6394.98 --> 6401.218999999999
and the thing the statement is made

6398.639 --> 6403.4400000000005
and you cross-reference it with data

6401.219 --> 6406.5
with other relevant things and then

6403.44 --> 6409.619
there is no logical consistency with it

6406.5 --> 6411.78
the claim and everything else

6409.619 --> 6414.659
then it's wrong

6411.78 --> 6417.48
does it make any sense then and if it

6414.659 --> 6419.82
doesn't make any sense it's wrong right

6417.48 --> 6422.638999999999
if you could do that with flat Earth why

6419.82 --> 6425.099999999999
don't you try that with God

6422.639 --> 6428.159000000001
I'm pretty sure he'd appreciate that

6425.1 --> 6430.1990000000005
since God is truth and not exoteric

6428.159 --> 6433.619
rambling that doesn't make any sense but

6430.199 --> 6435.659
you must believe it or torture as hell

6433.619 --> 6438.599999999999
blah blah blah even though it's supposed

6435.659 --> 6440.839999999999
to be taken away by Christ because he

6438.6 --> 6444.4800000000005
died even though you literally

6440.84 --> 6446.639
experience sin still everybody does in

6444.48 --> 6449.218999999999
their life all the time

6446.639 --> 6451.05
right so even that technically doesn't

6449.219 --> 6453.719
make sense

6451.05 --> 6456.2390000000005
[Music]

6453.719 --> 6458.88
right now of course I understand there

6456.239 --> 6460.799999999999
are some really big esoteric

6458.88 --> 6463.26
implications to a lot of these

6460.8 --> 6465.659000000001
statements but when you then translate

6463.26 --> 6468.1990000000005
that to an exoteric setting and just say

6465.659 --> 6468.199
this that

6470.88 --> 6474.659000000001
all the sin

6472.619 --> 6477.0
wrong it's just wrong it doesn't make

6474.659 --> 6479.179
any logical consistent sense

6477.0 --> 6479.179
foreign

6484.199 --> 6489.32
not if you take it literal like that

6492.3 --> 6498.2390000000005
the esoterics are lost when you do that

6495.119 --> 6500.42
when you oversimplify it to an exoteric

6498.239 --> 6500.419999999999
thing

6504.42 --> 6512.84
the meaning is lost the context is lost

6509.4 --> 6512.839999999999
when you exeterize

6518.34 --> 6524.82
the punishment is gone oh really good

6521.52 --> 6527.88
surfing really

6524.82 --> 6530.58
you you think that the punishment for

6527.88 --> 6532.1990000000005
sin is gone

6530.58 --> 6534.96
I

6532.199 --> 6537.178999999999
I like to say that that's absolutely

6534.96 --> 6540.54
incorrect

6537.179 --> 6544.5
the punishment for sin is literally

6540.54 --> 6547.139
baked into the fabric of reality itself

6544.5 --> 6549.96
it is part of the design

6547.139 --> 6551.1
the punishment is not gone it's right

6549.96 --> 6554.159
there

6551.1 --> 6556.7390000000005
right there when you do it

6554.159 --> 6560.4
then it's literally as part of the

6556.739 --> 6562.98
fabric of natural consequences

6560.4 --> 6566.04
and that's even part of what logos is

6562.98 --> 6568.138999999999
based on logical consequences natural

6566.04 --> 6569.34
development

6568.139 --> 6571.7390000000005
yeah

6569.34 --> 6574.8
so that's just Preposterous thing to say

6571.739 --> 6578.58
the punishment is gone no it's right

6574.8 --> 6578.58
there it happens immediately

6579.54 --> 6585.96
took her buddy no no you get punished if

6583.44 --> 6589.08
you sin you get punished

6585.96 --> 6590.219
and I'm talking in life you get the

6589.08 --> 6592.199
punishment

6590.219 --> 6595.26
in life

6592.199 --> 6597.78
you sin you get the punishment oh you

6595.26 --> 6600.3
didn't think it was a sin okay well then

6597.78 --> 6602.699
you have another chance to realize that

6600.3 --> 6605.52
and don't do it again just like Jesus

6602.699 --> 6610.08
thought yeah what he taught is the real

6605.52 --> 6615.2390000000005
thing he can't take it away you can't

6610.08 --> 6617.76
take the fabric of reality away

6615.239 --> 6621.0599999999995
do you understand you can only help

6617.76 --> 6624.139
people navigate through it and that is

6621.06 --> 6624.139
what Jesus did

6626.76 --> 6632.360000000001
after we die well you don't know what

6628.44 --> 6632.36
happens after you die nobody does

6633.78 --> 6641.04
you can imagine a lot of things I'll be

6638.28 --> 6642.48
accepting whatever fake

6641.04 --> 6644.219
brings me

6642.48 --> 6646.94
whatever God

6644.219 --> 6646.94
brings me

6647.219 --> 6651.719
after we done why don't you stop

6649.44 --> 6654.299999999999
worrying about after you die and why

6651.719 --> 6655.139
don't you actually work with when you

6654.3 --> 6658.38
live

6655.139 --> 6661.679
good servant you know that life is about

6658.38 --> 6664.4400000000005
living and not obsessing over things you

6661.679 --> 6665.9400000000005
have no grip on and then after you die

6664.44 --> 6668.699
it's like oh everything is about after

6665.94 --> 6671.04
you die why don't you just freaking live

6668.699 --> 6673.739
and actually build on the knowledge

6671.04 --> 6677.699
dispensed

6673.739 --> 6680.459999999999
by holy people like Jesus Christ the

6677.699 --> 6684.5599999999995
knowledge dispensed he dispensed he

6680.46 --> 6688.32
dispense for Life practical life advice

6684.56 --> 6691.1990000000005
cultural Building Life advice

6688.32 --> 6694.38
was he obsessed with death was he

6691.199 --> 6696.9
constantly like oh oh you're going to

6694.38 --> 6700.02
hell if you said no no that's what

6696.9 --> 6706.08
[ __ ] priests did

6700.02 --> 6706.080000000001
the Millennia after that yeah no Jesus

6706.86 --> 6712.44
he knew logos fabric of reality if you

6711.42 --> 6716.46
sin

6712.44 --> 6717.799999999999
then the fabric of reality will the

6716.46 --> 6721.32
God's will

6717.8 --> 6724.26
it dispenses the punishment in order for

6721.32 --> 6726.599
you to learn your lesson or not and

6724.26 --> 6730.1990000000005
perish under it

6726.599 --> 6733.679
Jesus did not take that away he revealed

6730.199 --> 6735.598999999999
it he revealed it

6733.679 --> 6738.2390000000005
he showed it

6735.599 --> 6740.599
didn't take it away he showed it was

6738.239 --> 6740.598999999999
there

6757.92 --> 6761.96
don't worry because of Jesus well yeah

6762.54 --> 6767.94
that's fine I mean he is a pretty good

6765.48 --> 6769.739
example if you just do what he says yeah

6767.94 --> 6772.5199999999995
things will be all right even if you

6769.739 --> 6776.218999999999
don't fully understand that's fine right

6772.52 --> 6779.34
this exoteric mumbo jumbo that you keep

6776.219 --> 6780.9
echoing because other people Echo it in

6779.34 --> 6782.639
the same fashion not understanding

6780.9 --> 6784.98
anything about it

6782.639 --> 6789.36
doesn't make that real

6784.98 --> 6793.44
that's fake that's chanting

6789.36 --> 6796.139
that's mind control priest techniques

6793.44 --> 6799.138999999999
that's what they were designed for by

6796.139 --> 6801.06
men after Christ

6799.139 --> 6804.619
and before that and by the way as well

6801.06 --> 6807.3
but they they should definitely try to

6804.619 --> 6808.98
encapsulate Jesus's teachings with it as

6807.3 --> 6812.659000000001
well

6808.98 --> 6812.659
they have for a millennia

6823.08 --> 6826.88
right anyway I'll stop pushing you on

6826.08 --> 6830.96
this

6826.88 --> 6830.96
but I'm very serious

6831.119 --> 6838.0199999999995
God is truth

6834.42 --> 6841.02
God is in sight

6838.02 --> 6841.02
understanding

6841.08 --> 6844.8
if you're gonna chant something you

6842.94 --> 6847.08
don't understand it makes no logical

6844.8 --> 6852.02
sense and yet you persist chanting it

6847.08 --> 6852.0199999999995
then that to me is a sin

6854.639 --> 6857.06
right

6857.4 --> 6861.78
I I don't know if I'm going to be

6859.86 --> 6863.94
exactly correct about that but wouldn't

6861.78 --> 6865.5
that fall basically under speaking in

6863.94 --> 6868.08
with tongues

6865.5 --> 6870.96
well maybe that speaking with tongues is

6868.08 --> 6873.179
more about knowingly lying

6870.96 --> 6875.34
I'm not sure

6873.179 --> 6878.34
if you're just gonna ramble things you

6875.34 --> 6881.900000000001
don't understand yet you act on it

6878.34 --> 6881.900000000001
that just seems dangerous

6885.96 --> 6892.44
not like I'm scared dangerous it just

6889.44 --> 6897.379999999999
seems like not a good effect not

6892.44 --> 6897.379999999999
stabilizing not helping develop

6898.02 --> 6900.7390000000005
anyway

6915.179 --> 6920.42
yeah okay good servant that's really

6918.179 --> 6920.42
nice

6925.26 --> 6929.76
no you don't you don't understand what

6927.719 --> 6931.88
you're talking about you're just echoing

6929.76 --> 6931.88
it

6931.98 --> 6940.678999999999
you have not shown me any logic logical

6937.32 --> 6943.5
structure behind the things you've said

6940.679 --> 6946.139
you just Echo it

6943.5 --> 6948.96
you don't understand it if you did you

6946.139 --> 6951.56
would be able to explain it through

6948.96 --> 6951.56
logic

6951.78 --> 6960.42
logic not belief not trust logic logic

6957.42 --> 6960.42
logos

6975.3 --> 6978.3
ah

6988.099 --> 6991.5
I don't know I'm not gonna trust you on

6990.42 --> 6993.719
that at all

6991.5 --> 6995.52
fine

6993.719 --> 6999.54
you think it's Adam

6995.52 --> 6999.540000000001
that's his name sure

7000.86 --> 7004.48
I'm just gonna call him Jesus Christ

7024.199 --> 7028.098999999999
yeah George Sanford what size your

7026.48 --> 7032.44
freaking birth certificate and everybody

7028.099 --> 7032.4400000000005
else's so it's all very nice

7033.32 --> 7036.94
copyright whatever

7068.96 --> 7071.56
hmm

7079.699 --> 7083.839999999999
okay well I'm gonna round out the show

7082.34 --> 7087.08
guys I'm

7083.84 --> 7088.88
Gonna Leave it to this I stand by

7087.08 --> 7091.28
everything I said

7088.88 --> 7093.7390000000005
everything

7091.28 --> 7097.82
really mean it

7093.739 --> 7101.718999999999
I have full confidence

7097.82 --> 7103.5199999999995
that my logic my logos that the path

7101.719 --> 7105.4
that I choose

7103.52 --> 7110.119000000001
through

7105.4 --> 7113.598999999999
this jumbled esoteric and exoteric mess

7110.119 --> 7116.719
I'm convinced I'm confident that I am

7113.599 --> 7119.84
absolutely correct and I will not be

7116.719 --> 7122.84
dissuaded except I have a logical

7119.84 --> 7125.54
consistency

7122.84 --> 7129.7390000000005
if you cannot apply that

7125.54 --> 7132.139
to whatever your claim is I will utterly

7129.739 --> 7135.44
reject you

7132.139 --> 7138.7390000000005
and I will keep doing that and if you

7135.44 --> 7140.659
then persist doing it over and over and

7138.739 --> 7143.239
over again like you're certainly now

7140.659 --> 7145.28
your special Jehovah's Witness that

7143.239 --> 7148.04
insists to come to my door every day

7145.28 --> 7152.5599999999995
then I will pick up on that get really

7148.04 --> 7152.56
agitated and eventually kick you out

7152.9 --> 7158.78
everything I said I stand behind and I

7156.26 --> 7161.599
will until somebody

7158.78 --> 7164.48
proves logos

7161.599 --> 7166.400000000001
in your beliefs

7164.48 --> 7168.739
yeah you have paper that's really cool

7166.4 --> 7172.179
that's that's cute good servant that's

7168.739 --> 7172.178999999999
really cute I don't care

7172.699 --> 7178.178999999999
you have no logical consistency in your

7175.639 --> 7178.179
arguments

7197.659 --> 7202.219
anyway

7200.179 --> 7204.08
ah

7202.219 --> 7206.96
it's good to be back

7204.08 --> 7210.139
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

7206.96 --> 7212.9
liked the show you two good servant you

7210.139 --> 7215.119
gotta let it go now cause yeah you are

7212.9 --> 7218.48
riled up I I just basically kicked you

7215.119 --> 7220.88
in your belief nuts yes I did

7218.48 --> 7222.919999999999
because I think that you in a way

7220.88 --> 7226.219
deserve that

7222.92 --> 7229.52
why because I think you can get over it

7226.219 --> 7232.88
you can get an actual grip

7229.52 --> 7235.6990000000005
I think you can I might be wrong it's up

7232.88 --> 7238.6990000000005
to you that's why I do it

7235.699 --> 7242.0
because I believe in you

7238.699 --> 7244.699
I believe that you can take it

7242.0 --> 7246.679
and grow out of it

7244.699 --> 7249.138999999999
out of it

7246.679 --> 7252.08
because it's not a good place to be it's

7249.139 --> 7255.56
not good to believe in anything that you

7252.08 --> 7256.639
literally do not understand it's always

7255.56 --> 7259.3
bad

7256.639 --> 7259.3
