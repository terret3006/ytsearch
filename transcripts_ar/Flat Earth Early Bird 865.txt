clouds it's been quite sunny

92.24 --> 96.88
right now there's a cloud in front of

94.079 --> 96.88
the sun but

97.28 --> 102.64
it's less cloudy than yesterday it's

100.24 --> 106.64
been really beautiful

102.64 --> 108.479
wind is not cold it's pretty still

106.64 --> 115.84
and when the sun's out it's really nice

108.479 --> 115.84
and warm

123.6 --> 129.84
all right

135.12 --> 137.52
so

138.56 --> 147.52
it is friday the 16th

143.36 --> 147.52
of april 2021

150.08 --> 157.28
i'm gonna have it to our show today

153.519 --> 160.8
as usual hey neil cosentino

157.28 --> 160.8
first in chat good to see you

161.36 --> 163.84
morning

168.16 --> 171.84
got some green tea here

177.2 --> 179.599
right

182.84 --> 189.68
yeah i had a pretty late

186.159 --> 193.12
night last night for my doing

189.68 --> 196.31900000000002
i kind of yeah since yes uh two days ago

193.12 --> 196.31900000000002
i started re-watching

196.4 --> 201.76000000000002
uh stranger things

199.519 --> 201.76000000000002
so

202.56 --> 206.72
like as a distraction and to basically

205.36 --> 208.64000000000001
take a second look at it

206.72 --> 213.68
because first time it made it quite a

208.64 --> 216.72
good impression but

213.68 --> 220.08
yeah i thought it was worthy

216.72 --> 221.84
looking it again almost for

220.08 --> 223.76000000000002
through the first season and i'm just

221.84 --> 224.84
yeah paying attention to a lot of

223.76 --> 228.56
influences

224.84 --> 228.56
again concepts

230.4 --> 235.28
their expression of the shadow realm

236.959 --> 241.28
and yeah that whole series at least the

239.519 --> 244.31900000000002
first season just really makes me want

241.28 --> 244.319
to get into d and d

252.84 --> 255.84
again

256.31 --> 262.639
[Music]

259.199 --> 264.40000000000003
all right and yeah kept kept up

262.639 --> 265.919
at least compared to the last few days

264.4 --> 269.35999999999996
kept up pretty late

265.919 --> 271.59999999999997
so right other than that

269.36 --> 272.72
all day was pretty interesting there was

271.6 --> 275.52000000000004
like very

272.72 --> 275.52000000000004
energy rich

276.0 --> 282.24
atmosphere overall

279.84 --> 283.75899999999996
i was like having a really crushing day

282.24 --> 288.479
yesterday

283.759 --> 291.759
like just high energy

288.479 --> 295.59999999999997
negativity overall really

291.759 --> 297.91900000000004
didn't get all that much in the way

295.6 --> 299.199
although yeah today again this morning

297.919 --> 303.039
it did a little but

299.199 --> 306.24
still not as bad as like two days ago

303.039 --> 308.639
uh hey ralph rodriguez good to see you

306.24 --> 308.639
in chat

309.199 --> 312.8
all right the flat earth debate was

311.12 --> 316.72
pretty good i was

312.8 --> 318.88
active the entire first hour at least

316.72 --> 320.40000000000003
went for groceries in the second kind of

318.88 --> 323.039
in a hurry

320.4 --> 325.84
still missed like the the tail end of

323.039 --> 325.84
the after show

326.24 --> 330.96000000000004
hey amanda young good morning

334.72 --> 341.36
right uh also yeah on

338.0 --> 342.0
alex jones david ike came on again and

341.36 --> 344.56
that was

342.0 --> 344.56
interesting

345.52 --> 348.96
like just because of the entire history

348.08 --> 351.84
of it all and

348.96 --> 352.63899999999995
like i watched david ike like very long

351.84 --> 355.84
ago

352.639 --> 360.639
probably now i did bump into him

355.84 --> 363.19899999999996
through alex jones i think

360.639 --> 364.56
like indirectly i was getting into

363.199 --> 367.52000000000004
alternative stuff

364.56 --> 368.0
david ike was very much on the scene

367.52 --> 371.88
there

368.0 --> 375.759
in the alternative alternative medicine

371.88 --> 381.28
anti-vaxxers chemtrails

375.759 --> 383.68
and yeah

381.28 --> 384.96
david ike was kind of like more widely

383.68 --> 387.68
known even in

384.96 --> 389.44
in the alternative scene than alex jones

387.68 --> 392.639
because he was kind of considered

389.44 --> 393.52
even back then as sort of a controlled

392.639 --> 397.6
opposition

393.52 --> 401.68
in ways and it's like it

397.6 --> 403.759
but i spent a lot of time back then even

401.68 --> 405.84000000000003
like trying to defend alex jones and his

403.759 --> 409.199
positions

405.84 --> 410.71999999999997
because yeah even back then

409.199 --> 414.0
don't know whether it was just the

410.72 --> 414.0
conditioning or just

414.08 --> 421.599
the intensity of his alarmism

418.56 --> 424.24
first versus the subtle

421.599 --> 424.639
learning curves that were happening back

424.24 --> 426.96000000000004
then

424.639 --> 428.08
thanks to the internet revolution

426.96 --> 431.039
basically it

428.08 --> 431.039
it completing

432.16 --> 438.319
anyway seeing david ike back again it

435.599 --> 438.319
was pretty cool

441.44 --> 447.68
hey glad you are seeing paul hall

444.8 --> 447.68
properly yeah

448.639 --> 454.72
well yeah i i don't buy into that

451.84 --> 456.23999999999995
like i'm not gonna play politics with

454.72 --> 464.0
with friends

456.24 --> 466.879
i'm not doing that

464.0 --> 468.08
right but this is what we're seeing

466.879 --> 470.40000000000003
right now

468.08 --> 471.52
we're concerning that new it's just the

470.4 --> 474.79999999999995
first response

471.52 --> 477.75899999999996
basically so

474.8 --> 479.68
give it a week and then see where

477.759 --> 481.44
everybody's position is going to be

479.68 --> 483.28000000000003
because it's probably like this it's

481.44 --> 484.479
just the first response right because

483.28 --> 489.28
nobody really knows

484.479 --> 489.28
what what to do when somebody that just

489.44 --> 495.599
in a bizarre way kind of switches all of

492.72 --> 497.44000000000005
a sudden nobody really knows what to do

495.599 --> 497.96
with that so there's always going to be

497.44 --> 501.12
like a

497.96 --> 502.23999999999995
strategical response at first and

501.12 --> 505.44
nathan's always

502.24 --> 508.56
about the strategic response

505.44 --> 510.56
so we'll see where this rolls towards

508.56 --> 512.64
and then everybody's position is going

510.56 --> 516.32
to be

512.64 --> 520.08
a little bit more down to earth i think

516.32 --> 522.08
uh right

520.08 --> 523.9190000000001
that was during the after show we had

522.08 --> 525.12
after the after show i still had a very

523.919 --> 528.399
long talk

525.12 --> 530.8
especially with brian which was pretty

528.399 --> 530.8
awesome

532.839 --> 539.2
uh

535.36 --> 542.72
right also own benjamin over at

539.2 --> 545.12
gary and terry's tea time with gary and

542.72 --> 545.12
terry

547.2 --> 551.2
uh although yeah i kind of like didn't

549.839 --> 554.6400000000001
watch it live

551.2 --> 554.6400000000001
i missed most of it live

555.36 --> 564.9590000000001
uh who switched paul hall iron 26

562.399 --> 565.839
like a regular flat earth debate

564.959 --> 569.8389999999999
panelist

565.839 --> 573.6800000000001
like in the last few years

569.839 --> 575.519
it's weird uh

573.68 --> 577.68
you're probably gonna hear more about it

575.519 --> 580.8
like this is not the show

577.68 --> 584.959
like i am not just going to do all that

580.8 --> 586.64
right this stuff first needs to be kind

584.959 --> 590.0
of resolved

586.64 --> 592.64
before i'm gonna address that otherwise

590.0 --> 593.839
i'm just gonna step on a lot of toes for

592.64 --> 596.959
no reason

593.839 --> 596.9590000000001
i think uh

597.12 --> 605.839
right after that strain and watch some

601.12 --> 610.5600000000001
stranger things

605.839 --> 610.5600000000001
let's see anything else or some videos

613.44 --> 618.399
oh yeah yeah beyond the imaginary curve

617.44 --> 622.0
also

618.399 --> 622.0
i almost forgot to write that down

627.279 --> 633.279
man there was like this fake arwen sock

629.519 --> 637.12
in there that was really annoying and

633.279 --> 639.04
from the way i gathered it the way

637.12 --> 641.279
it was trolling i'm pretty sure it was

639.04 --> 644.8
ranty also since ranty that

641.279 --> 647.04
day yesterday came in

644.8 --> 648.24
and he was in one of his moods again

647.04 --> 650.8
like oh let's

648.24 --> 652.16
let's poke our win like he didn't agree

650.8 --> 654.7199999999999
with my attitude

652.16 --> 657.279
right he's not agreeing with my

654.72 --> 659.6
aggressive attitude

657.279 --> 661.04
and so then he decides to do this sort

659.6 --> 664.32
of thing and and

661.04 --> 666.7199999999999
bring out the sock accounts to

664.32 --> 669.839
to slander me because he's done that

666.72 --> 672.8000000000001
plenty of times in the past

669.839 --> 673.36
i'm pretty sure it was him but yeah

672.8 --> 675.279
since

673.36 --> 676.9590000000001
at del's there is literally just no

675.279 --> 680.16
moderation whatsoever

676.959 --> 683.76
they just kept it around

680.16 --> 684.8
pretty annoying but yeah i was not gonna

683.76 --> 687.6
let it

684.8 --> 689.04
get in my way because i like i thought

687.6 --> 691.6
what dale was talking about was

689.04 --> 691.5999999999999
interesting

700.839 --> 703.839
right

706.48 --> 709.519
it wasn't around for chris well chris

708.399 --> 713.04
monk was

709.519 --> 717.839
even before that chris monk was really

713.04 --> 717.8389999999999
from the olden days

718.079 --> 723.1999999999999
now randy came in my chat yesterday on

721.6 --> 726.9590000000001
the early bird show

723.2 --> 730.0790000000001
neil and then later

726.959 --> 734.16
a like a sock clone of

730.079 --> 738.399
mine started to basically

734.16 --> 741.12
like enact it like a homosexual

738.399 --> 743.839
and the way he did that i'm pretty damn

741.12 --> 746.5600000000001
sure it was ranty

743.839 --> 749.519
way he did it i just recognized it and i

746.56 --> 749.5189999999999
i know ranty

749.76 --> 753.279
well enough to know that's him i even

752.399 --> 756.24
called him out

753.279 --> 758.32
and he literally shot it shut up in that

756.24 --> 761.2
moment right and if he wasn't

758.32 --> 763.6800000000001
he would have immediately made fun of it

761.2 --> 763.6800000000001
he didn't

765.2 --> 773.839
so i know it was him

776.399 --> 780.079
okay neil cosentino well

788.88 --> 794.8
well ranty just has a pretty severe

792.399 --> 796.639
scumbag inside of him and sometimes he

794.8 --> 800.7199999999999
gets in the mood and then he lets

796.639 --> 803.279
that thing do whatever it wants

800.72 --> 805.2
doesn't seem to have any moral objection

803.279 --> 807.8389999999999
to

805.2 --> 808.88
get secretive and manipulative and dark

807.839 --> 812.0
and just

808.88 --> 814.72
evil so yeah he has that

812.0 --> 815.76
he's even kind of even laughingly admits

814.72 --> 819.839
it sometimes

815.76 --> 821.12
right just he does and he's like proud

819.839 --> 824.32
that he doesn't care

821.12 --> 826.9590000000001
so that's

824.32 --> 827.7600000000001
you know i le i kind of let him like

826.959 --> 829.92
because i

827.76 --> 833.519
consider him very similar to antonio

829.92 --> 833.519
subarats in that fashion

834.399 --> 838.639
like you just know like oh when he's not

836.8 --> 840.56
in a mood then it's perfectly fine i

838.639 --> 843.12
have literally no problem when he's not

840.56 --> 846.079
in the mood but when suddenly

843.12 --> 849.04
he can get in a mood usually in response

846.079 --> 851.68
to somebody else's mood like my moods

849.04 --> 852.56
and then he gets like that and then when

851.68 --> 855.4399999999999
you notice it

852.56 --> 856.959
you just stay away from him and just let

855.44 --> 859.6800000000001
him

856.959 --> 862.88
roll around in his own filth until he

859.68 --> 862.88
his mood is over again

868.8 --> 873.04
hello ajm joseph

877.03 --> 882.51
[Music]

882.839 --> 885.839
369.

886.68 --> 889.8
[Music]

893.04 --> 903.5999999999999
hey moth eyes

898.8 --> 908.0
huh it's a nice full chat james mason

903.6 --> 910.0
oh yeah i got a a paypal donation

908.0 --> 912.72
i think somewhere this morning or last

910.0 --> 914.959
night from

912.72 --> 916.0
cameron cassie gilmore i think so thank

914.959 --> 919.04
you for that

916.0 --> 919.76
really appreciate that it helps i'm

919.04 --> 923.279
still like

919.76 --> 927.199
right now in this in the middle of the

923.279 --> 932.079
month and it's always kind of tough

927.199 --> 932.079
so i can definitely use the support

936.639 --> 941.839
how do you let a woman like patricia's

939.04 --> 945.519
dear get away

941.839 --> 945.519
uh i

948.639 --> 951.6
i don't know neil

952.0 --> 958.24
it's just he

955.68 --> 959.519
but with antonio super look antonio

958.24 --> 962.639
subratz has some

959.519 --> 967.04
really suppressed self

962.639 --> 970.5600000000001
value issues that he

967.04 --> 974.16
expresses through narcissism so like

970.56 --> 975.279
like that's why right it's actually kind

974.16 --> 978.48
of logic

975.279 --> 981.279
logical because patricia

978.48 --> 982.48
is not a perfect woman but yeah she has

981.279 --> 986.399
amazing

982.48 --> 990.72
qualities and attributes and

986.399 --> 992.8
at some point you yeah if you're antonio

990.72 --> 994.639
you're gonna realize that she's more

992.8 --> 996.8
than you as it were that

994.639 --> 998.5600000000001
like it's gonna confront you with your

996.8 --> 999.68
inner self that's typically what love

998.56 --> 1002.4799999999999
does right

999.68 --> 1003.3599999999999
and then as a defense mechanism he just

1002.48 --> 1005.9200000000001
shuts himself

1003.36 --> 1008.0
off pushes it away because it's like too

1005.92 --> 1011.68
confronting

1008.0 --> 1014.959
that's how it works

1011.68 --> 1017.7589999999999
in a sort of mixed

1014.959 --> 1018.2399999999999
situation i went through something like

1017.759 --> 1023.6
that

1018.24 --> 1023.6
myself it's like double two-way

1023.68 --> 1029.6
with my ex although that wasn't the same

1027.36 --> 1032.6399999999999
setup as with patricia thank god

1029.6 --> 1036.1599999999999
nothing like that but it's like

1032.64 --> 1039.199
i thought in ways she was more than me

1036.16 --> 1042.64
like she was and in ways i was

1039.199 --> 1045.039
more than her and we both

1042.64 --> 1047.3600000000001
couldn't handle that after a certain

1045.039 --> 1047.36
point

1047.679 --> 1055.039
and then instead of i tried to basically

1051.679 --> 1057.76
like become a team but it couldn't

1055.039 --> 1057.76
really work

1058.08 --> 1061.52
and then it wasn't me it was actually

1060.88 --> 1063.8400000000001
her that

1061.52 --> 1064.96
just cut it off at some point just like

1063.84 --> 1068.3999999999999
that just like

1064.96 --> 1070.16
literally like one like you're

1068.4 --> 1072.48
suddenly being suddenly you're

1070.16 --> 1073.44
spiritually executed just like that out

1072.48 --> 1075.679
of nowhere

1073.44 --> 1078.4
like middle in the middle of dreaming

1075.679 --> 1081.52
that wasn't what it was like to me

1078.4 --> 1083.6000000000001
so yeah it is different

1081.52 --> 1084.72
but i just understand where that comes

1083.6 --> 1088.48
from like i

1084.72 --> 1091.76
i could even he showed some of the signs

1088.48 --> 1094.24
before it all got out of hand right

1091.76 --> 1095.36
you can't hide that [ __ ] for me because

1094.24 --> 1098.88
i was very much

1095.36 --> 1101.6789999999999
into both of them i i really liked both

1098.88 --> 1102.4
i liked them as a couple and i kind of

1101.679 --> 1105.52
like

1102.4 --> 1107.76
i guess mills and wade was kind of

1105.52 --> 1109.36
acting like a bit of a distant caretaker

1107.76 --> 1112.559
like i was like

1109.36 --> 1113.12
yeah so i was paying attention to the

1112.559 --> 1117.12
signs

1113.12 --> 1117.12
and so i kind of saw it coming

1120.84 --> 1126.0
was because it was look

1124.4 --> 1128.48
the time they were together it was

1126.0 --> 1130.72
really awesome it really was it was like

1128.48 --> 1132.32
a real flat earth couple in the early

1130.72 --> 1135.84
days and

1132.32 --> 1136.6399999999999
both media driven and they kind of like

1135.84 --> 1138.72
let each other

1136.64 --> 1140.24
stray a bit so it like the chemistry

1138.72 --> 1143.3600000000001
wasn't perfect

1140.24 --> 1143.36
it was just like

1144.559 --> 1149.52
it was it was the moment it was the time

1147.6 --> 1152.0
you really had to be there in that

1149.52 --> 1156.16
energy in that early

1152.0 --> 1156.16
stage of awakening to to get

1157.28 --> 1162.0
could to get all that trendy exposing

1161.6 --> 1166.9599999999998
was

1162.0 --> 1166.96
popular two years ago yeah

1167.679 --> 1171.039
but that was just pathetic that he did

1169.44 --> 1174.48
that he that antonio did that

1171.039 --> 1174.48
that was really just pathetic

1174.88 --> 1182.48
like in in many ways

1179.36 --> 1182.4799999999998
very petty

1183.76 --> 1193.84
you were there right

1201.76 --> 1205.6
right mouth thighs yeah exactly

1203.84 --> 1206.0
patricia's here is a very good presenter

1205.6 --> 1208.0
interview

1206.0 --> 1209.52
but that's because she's like from a

1208.0 --> 1213.679
radio family

1209.52 --> 1215.9189999999999
right she grew up with that and

1213.679 --> 1217.8400000000001
so it was like that kind of a team like

1215.919 --> 1221.6000000000001
he was

1217.84 --> 1224.6399999999999
like a technical guy with a flat earth

1221.6 --> 1225.36
yeah like he has some visionary

1224.64 --> 1228.64
qualities

1225.36 --> 1232.6399999999999
like like he has some cosmogeny

1228.64 --> 1235.679
inside right i respect that skill

1232.64 --> 1237.039
just not don't really respect his social

1235.679 --> 1239.919
side as it were

1237.039 --> 1241.679
so but they were a team like that so

1239.919 --> 1244.0800000000002
everybody was like rooting for that

1241.679 --> 1244.0800000000002
anyway

1246.96 --> 1253.76
antonio was just looking for attention

1250.88 --> 1254.4
right well yeah after after they brought

1253.76 --> 1257.44
up

1254.4 --> 1258.64
broke up then absolutely it was looking

1257.44 --> 1260.799
for attention

1258.64 --> 1262.48
because he was feeling the vacuum he was

1260.799 --> 1264.0
missing it right he couldn't handle it

1262.48 --> 1265.6
it pushed it away

1264.0 --> 1267.679
doesn't mean that you're not gonna miss

1265.6 --> 1267.6789999999999
it

1268.24 --> 1272.159
i know all about that too but then he

1270.96 --> 1274.32
just

1272.159 --> 1275.3600000000001
like a sociopath just totally

1274.32 --> 1278.6399999999999
disrespected

1275.36 --> 1282.32
everything and threw her under the bus

1278.64 --> 1286.159
metaphorically declared her a [ __ ]

1282.32 --> 1286.1589999999999
and that basically himself

1286.24 --> 1291.84
made himself look absolutely ridiculous

1288.72 --> 1291.84
in plain sight

1293.12 --> 1295.52
anyway

1300.16 --> 1305.1200000000001
[Music]

1302.0 --> 1306.48
right both eyes to watch flat earth

1305.12 --> 1309.76
united kingdom

1306.48 --> 1313.76
antonio and oakley yeah yeah and steer

1309.76 --> 1318.8799999999999
yeah those were the good old days before

1313.76 --> 1321.36
before the infighting wars

1318.88 --> 1321.3600000000001
before

1322.08 --> 1327.039
before the great paranoia basically

1330.08 --> 1337.039
i think it was a time where a lot of

1334.0 --> 1339.919
people that we now know as trenchers

1337.039 --> 1341.44
and and their people hiding in the

1339.919 --> 1342.64
shadow because the trenchers are

1341.44 --> 1346.0
basically just

1342.64 --> 1349.8400000000001
the faces right there's

1346.0 --> 1353.76
people backing them with resources

1349.84 --> 1360.6399999999999
and connections i'm very sure of this

1353.76 --> 1363.76
very sure i can feel it and they

1360.64 --> 1364.7990000000002
were just waiting to stand by and then

1363.76 --> 1368.8799999999999
when the first

1364.799 --> 1372.8799999999999
breaking apart of the morale

1368.88 --> 1372.88
in the scene started to happen

1373.12 --> 1378.08
that's when they come out of the shadows

1376.08 --> 1380.9199999999998
anonymously start to play

1378.08 --> 1382.32
into people's need for division

1380.92 --> 1385.44
[Music]

1382.32 --> 1387.84
and then they created basically

1385.44 --> 1390.799
like a lot of the paranoia conspiracy

1387.84 --> 1393.84
they they unrolled that over everybody

1390.799 --> 1396.72
to reinforce the divide

1393.84 --> 1398.6399999999999
and that's what happened i think got

1396.72 --> 1399.84
pulled in by trolls in his chat well

1398.64 --> 1402.96
there you go

1399.84 --> 1404.0
right there you go that's basically also

1402.96 --> 1407.1200000000001
what i'm saying

1404.0 --> 1413.039
what i'm saying is that was

1407.12 --> 1413.039
not just random trolls that was a plan

1414.159 --> 1418.24
not antonio's plan it was a plan that

1417.28 --> 1421.6
was

1418.24 --> 1426.159
a group of other people playing on him

1421.6 --> 1428.24
because hey narcissists are really easy

1426.159 --> 1430.5590000000002
to play

1428.24 --> 1432.159
from the dark side they're really easy

1430.559 --> 1434.48
to play

1432.159 --> 1434.48
right

1438.4 --> 1444.64
so yeah they just saw the opportunity

1442.159 --> 1445.3600000000001
and did it and started kind of like the

1444.64 --> 1448.5590000000002
entire

1445.36 --> 1448.559
flat earth infighting

1449.52 --> 1456.08
that ignited that before

1452.96 --> 1458.88
kind of dormant spark

1456.08 --> 1460.72
which would be fueled by the frustration

1458.88 --> 1463.919
of pretty much the entire world

1460.72 --> 1466.32
fee yeah opposing you

1463.919 --> 1468.4
and then that frustration was basically

1466.32 --> 1472.96
relayed onto others

1468.4 --> 1476.3200000000002
other flat earthers

1472.96 --> 1478.64
and once that gets going

1476.32 --> 1481.12
yeah you're always going to have some of

1478.64 --> 1484.96
that feel and that suspicion and that

1481.12 --> 1484.9599999999998
fear in the background

1485.679 --> 1489.279
and for a lot of people it's been very

1487.279 --> 1492.64
hard to get that away

1489.279 --> 1494.08
like that original sensation of peace

1492.64 --> 1497.1200000000001
among flat earthers

1494.08 --> 1499.52
has never really returned people have

1497.12 --> 1502.8799999999999
tried

1499.52 --> 1505.279
but would always be very

1502.88 --> 1506.5590000000002
fearful towards other like and trusting

1505.279 --> 1509.2
always suspecting

1506.559 --> 1512.08
like yeah but we can't evolve that

1509.2 --> 1514.64
person because

1512.08 --> 1516.08
he typically throws stones and oh that

1514.64 --> 1518.5590000000002
might be dangerous right so

1516.08 --> 1520.559
suddenly everybody's all political

1518.559 --> 1523.6
strategists now about

1520.559 --> 1527.2
about their groups

1523.6 --> 1529.84
instead of the directness

1527.2 --> 1530.88
like the direct honesty that there was

1529.84 --> 1532.6399999999999
originally that

1530.88 --> 1534.0800000000002
that thing was there and then it was

1532.64 --> 1537.279
pretty much broken

1534.08 --> 1540.0
and i suspect like because

1537.279 --> 1541.2
uh for example eric dubay was or is kind

1540.0 --> 1543.12
of like the first

1541.2 --> 1546.24
like the trolls got to him like even

1543.12 --> 1549.279
before the flat earth awakening started

1546.24 --> 1549.279
pretty sure about that

1549.76 --> 1555.12
but like people

1553.2 --> 1557.44
knew that about him and they kind of

1555.12 --> 1560.32
kept him on the sidelines let just let

1557.44 --> 1563.2
him do his own thing

1560.32 --> 1563.6789999999999
and still pay attention to his flat

1563.2 --> 1568.4
earth

1563.679 --> 1568.4
ideas and works and then

1569.36 --> 1576.6399999999999
yeah and then among the the group

1572.88 --> 1578.48
the first wave suddenly

1576.64 --> 1579.76
yeah it that sort of [ __ ] came in

1578.48 --> 1582.799
everywhere

1579.76 --> 1585.6
and also like just this huge bad habit

1582.799 --> 1588.32
of kind of like wanting revenge

1585.6 --> 1589.4399999999998
and going and making your sock trolls to

1588.32 --> 1591.52
troll others that's

1589.44 --> 1592.88
at least happened a lot of people

1591.52 --> 1595.9189999999999
started doing that

1592.88 --> 1599.44
and i think that that's again

1595.919 --> 1601.44
people behind the scenes the trolls

1599.44 --> 1603.679
we sometimes might see them as the

1601.44 --> 1607.2
trolls

1603.679 --> 1612.72
i think that they literally taught

1607.2 --> 1614.88
some of these people how to do that

1612.72 --> 1616.4
just like oh you you bump into me in

1614.88 --> 1618.72
discord and they say like oh

1616.4 --> 1621.96
look look don't listen but don't tell

1618.72 --> 1624.84
anybody but this is how you do it

1621.96 --> 1627.3600000000001
[Music]

1624.84 --> 1630.08
right

1627.36 --> 1631.76
to be called out steer along that's so

1630.08 --> 1635.36
[ __ ]

1631.76 --> 1635.36
that like

1637.919 --> 1655.8400000000001
do bay i don't think dubai even knows

1642.159 --> 1655.8400000000001
what a vagina looks like dude

1665.6 --> 1670.48
like to get a little owen benjenesque i

1668.08 --> 1672.96
think that eric dube is like a vagina

1670.48 --> 1683.84
virgin

1672.96 --> 1683.8400000000001
he's probably never seen one

1686.08 --> 1697.84
that she was a shield so how was she

1689.36 --> 1697.84
a shield iron 26

1704.97 --> 1711.249
[Music]

1711.919 --> 1721.039
why do i say that about eric dubay

1715.679 --> 1721.039
because i think he's gay but that's okay

1721.84 --> 1727.4399999999998
word not for his raging gamma tendencies

1725.679 --> 1730.0
and calling everybody shills and

1727.44 --> 1730.0
[ __ ]

1732.799 --> 1738.08
right he pretty much started this vagne

1736.24 --> 1740.32
complex in flat earth

1738.08 --> 1740.32
so

1746.159 --> 1750.0800000000002
right if you have discernment you don't

1748.0 --> 1751.039
worry about chills well i don't worry

1750.08 --> 1753.6789999999999
about chills

1751.039 --> 1756.24
i don't worry about him at all like how

1753.679 --> 1759.6000000000001
many times do i complain about

1756.24 --> 1762.24
eric dubay being bad right

1759.6 --> 1763.52
no i actually spend more time overall

1762.24 --> 1767.1200000000001
complimenting

1763.52 --> 1769.76
the things that he does do well

1767.12 --> 1771.279
instead of complaining about yeah what

1769.76 --> 1776.64
he's done wrong

1771.279 --> 1776.64
right i prefer in general to do this

1776.799 --> 1783.9189999999999
if people have some good qualities

1780.64 --> 1785.76
in their work online regarding flat

1783.919 --> 1789.8400000000001
earth

1785.76 --> 1789.84
right because a lot of people

1790.72 --> 1796.24
out there just have some

1794.08 --> 1798.559
kind of a bad element to them in some

1796.24 --> 1798.559
way

1798.799 --> 1804.48
bad character traits etc

1802.24 --> 1806.3990000000001
so you got to be forgiving or there's

1804.48 --> 1808.48
going to be nobody left and that's kind

1806.399 --> 1811.84
of like the problem that these

1808.48 --> 1815.039
chill hunters have

1811.84 --> 1817.279
is that yeah

1815.039 --> 1820.8799999999999
their spirit is only effectively seeking

1817.279 --> 1825.279
to destroy everybody else

1820.88 --> 1827.44
to be the the the top dog the big king

1825.279 --> 1828.399
on the pile of skulls effectively that's

1827.44 --> 1832.48
what it comes

1828.399 --> 1836.2399999999998
down to can you be a gay flat earther

1832.48 --> 1840.64
sure you can

1836.24 --> 1840.64
just like don't let me know

1840.799 --> 1851.84
right i'm homophobic i don't like that

1845.12 --> 1851.84
keep it to yourself please

1854.399 --> 1865.84
no i'm not gonna buy that book thanks

1868.72 --> 1872.559
right super straight earth yes there are

1870.88 --> 1875.679
those trolls i wouldn't say

1872.559 --> 1876.1589999999999
five super trolls i don't know how many

1875.679 --> 1877.44
it is

1876.159 --> 1879.679
there's a whole bunch of people

1877.44 --> 1882.96
including

1879.679 --> 1885.2
some bad flat earther characters

1882.96 --> 1886.08
some lesser known characters like

1885.2 --> 1889.1200000000001
friends of

1886.08 --> 1892.399
maine flat earthers a lot of them

1889.12 --> 1894.799
so i don't think it's just a handful of

1892.399 --> 1894.799
trolls

1895.12 --> 1900.799
like when it starts going it can be

1898.24 --> 1902.559
one troll doing a lot of activity but

1900.799 --> 1905.519
that doesn't mean that it's

1902.559 --> 1906.0
usually the same troll because they just

1905.519 --> 1908.159
have

1906.0 --> 1910.0
moods then they feel the need to do that

1908.159 --> 1913.44
to find some kind of

1910.0 --> 1915.039
occult power out of it right express

1913.44 --> 1916.799
power without the consequence because

1915.039 --> 1920.96
nobody knows who they are

1916.799 --> 1923.76
except god

1920.96 --> 1924.48
and then they yeah they get over it

1923.76 --> 1926.1589999999999
again

1924.48 --> 1934.0
they calm down and they start to do

1926.159 --> 1936.5590000000002
other things

1934.0 --> 1937.76
i'm straight all the way don't get to it

1936.559 --> 1940.32
get it twisted

1937.76 --> 1940.32
no no

1943.6 --> 1946.8799999999999
i never thought you were gay

1947.84 --> 1952.6399999999999
jesus admit your hope of what

1953.36 --> 1960.559
i said what the [ __ ] dude

1956.96 --> 1962.3990000000001
no aaron armstrong go [ __ ] yourself and

1960.559 --> 1966.08
nobody delete that please

1962.399 --> 1968.559
because i'm gonna address it oh my god

1966.08 --> 1969.9189999999999
oh my god it's so terrible i'm admitting

1968.559 --> 1973.44
i'm homophobic yeah but

1969.919 --> 1977.2
it's [ __ ] true [ __ ] it's true

1973.44 --> 1979.44
i really don't like it it makes me sick

1977.2 --> 1982.3990000000001
right that doesn't mean i have like this

1979.44 --> 1985.919
ideology perspective on it even

1982.399 --> 1988.1589999999999
although through well through biblical

1985.919 --> 1990.88
teachings i know it's a mistake

1988.159 --> 1993.3600000000001
with consequences right within the

1990.88 --> 1993.3600000000001
design

1993.44 --> 1997.76
and yeah i have been a big portion of my

1996.64 --> 2000.7990000000002
teens kind of

1997.76 --> 2003.679
gaslighted by certain people

2000.799 --> 2005.679
that i might be gay and i didn't know

2003.679 --> 2009.519
first i didn't even understand what that

2005.679 --> 2013.039
was i just knew that every time

2009.519 --> 2013.039
there were just like because

2014.72 --> 2020.0
i can have like pretty strong feelings

2018.399 --> 2022.4799999999998
in a positive way

2020.0 --> 2023.2
about some guys if they have the right

2022.48 --> 2025.44
spirit

2023.2 --> 2027.6000000000001
but it's not sexual and i i

2025.44 --> 2028.72
misunderstood that and other people that

2027.6 --> 2031.6
only have sex

2028.72 --> 2033.519
vision or whatever judge people by that

2031.6 --> 2036.0
they didn't understand it either so it

2033.519 --> 2038.08
was like a confusing situation

2036.0 --> 2040.159
and i thought at some point well maybe

2038.08 --> 2040.48
it might be i don't even understand what

2040.159 --> 2044.96
this

2040.48 --> 2047.919
is so kind of scientific minded i guess

2044.96 --> 2049.04
i tried it out and i like didn't seek

2047.919 --> 2052.0
out some

2049.04 --> 2053.919
kind of girl looking guy or anything but

2052.0 --> 2057.919
just like to really test it

2053.919 --> 2057.919
a guy that still looked kind of cool

2058.24 --> 2063.04
and guess what i almost threw up so that

2061.599 --> 2065.599
was like yeah well

2063.04 --> 2067.52
i don't need another test i'm pretty

2065.599 --> 2072.3990000000003
damn sure that

2067.52 --> 2072.399
it's not gay right

2072.839 --> 2078.7999999999997
so yeah

2075.679 --> 2079.28
i'm not gay and i don't like it i don't

2078.8 --> 2084.2400000000002
like

2079.28 --> 2088.079
gayness i don't like fairy behavior

2084.24 --> 2090.72
like i might tolerate it if i know so

2088.079 --> 2091.599
it's just a singular element to somebody

2090.72 --> 2094.3199999999997
and they're not

2091.599 --> 2095.44
like full-blown homosexuals and all that

2094.32 --> 2097.92
and that are going to

2095.44 --> 2100.56
make passes on me and [ __ ] because

2097.92 --> 2102.7200000000003
that's what i'm absolutely allergic to

2100.56 --> 2104.0789999999997
that's where my homophobia came comes

2102.72 --> 2107.2
from right

2104.079 --> 2110.0
because people have tried that [ __ ] and

2107.2 --> 2110.7999999999997
like that that's like sexual harassment

2110.0 --> 2113.52
people

2110.8 --> 2116.48
that is sexual harassment yeah so i have

2113.52 --> 2118.32
a [ __ ] good reason to be homophobic

2116.48 --> 2119.68
right because when you get sexually

2118.32 --> 2123.04
harassed

2119.68 --> 2126.72
by homosexuals yeah that's going to make

2123.04 --> 2126.72
you for homophobic at some point

2128.839 --> 2134.24
right

2131.76 --> 2137.2000000000003
right it's it's i guess that might be

2134.24 --> 2140.24
similar as to how some women

2137.2 --> 2141.68
that get just sexually harassed by by

2140.24 --> 2145.5989999999997
straight guys

2141.68 --> 2150.0789999999997
bad guys without any respect might

2145.599 --> 2153.599
get man-phobic

2150.079 --> 2156.5600000000004
like that because of that

2153.599 --> 2158.56
so yeah i could literally just say i am

2156.56 --> 2162.56
homophobic that's

2158.56 --> 2167.599
not a political declaration

2162.56 --> 2167.599
that's a medical declaration do you

2170.839 --> 2175.2799999999997
understand

2172.72 --> 2177.839
good oh if you can't handle that aaron

2175.28 --> 2181.0400000000004
armstrong then [ __ ] off

2177.839 --> 2184.64
because it's true it is true it's not

2181.04 --> 2187.52
true by choice right

2184.64 --> 2189.92
i'm not currently choosing to do that

2187.52 --> 2192.72
for some political reason

2189.92 --> 2195.6800000000003
no i think that you are definitely gay

2192.72 --> 2195.68
aaron armstrong

2197.359 --> 2201.839
and i don't care

2207.76 --> 2211.599
you don't want troll aids

2211.839 --> 2217.68
that's a good one oh that's hilarious

2215.359 --> 2218.72
well my homophobia it doesn't come from

2217.68 --> 2222.16
that

2218.72 --> 2229.839
it's just it's my spirit i just don't

2222.16 --> 2229.839
want it

2230.88 --> 2237.6800000000003
who cares if q is qe is not gay

2234.48 --> 2239.28
he has kids okay that's not a guarantee

2237.68 --> 2243.839
that you're not gay but i'm pretty sure

2239.28 --> 2243.8390000000004
he's not gay

2249.44 --> 2253.2000000000003
why are we talking about gay all of a

2251.119 --> 2256.32
sudden

2253.2 --> 2271.4399999999996

2352.88 --> 2359.2000000000003

2355.92 --> 2362.32
and just the idea of that made

2359.2 --> 2365.1189999999997
like really made me sick like i wanted

2362.32 --> 2365.119
to go away

2366.96 --> 2372.16
god like is that really what that's like

2372.4 --> 2379.76
god i don't want it like no

2376.079 --> 2383.52
ugh i'm so glad i like women

2379.76 --> 2387.28
or at least well like women that i'm

2383.52 --> 2387.28
very attracted to some women

2388.72 --> 2392.9599999999996
i think a lot of women have attractive

2390.8 --> 2394.2400000000002
qualities even if they're not like super

2392.96 --> 2397.28
beautiful

2394.24 --> 2400.8799999999997
if they have good spirit management

2397.28 --> 2403.3590000000004
i find that attractive right

2400.88 --> 2404.0
it's just that every form of like

2403.359 --> 2407.44
physical

2404.0 --> 2408.0
attraction is always where there's real

2407.44 --> 2411.839
women

2408.0 --> 2411.839
like i can tell

2414.72 --> 2420.72
it's also that we're like i have met

2418.0 --> 2422.319
transsexuals and some were like pretty

2420.72 --> 2425.359
remarkable

2422.319 --> 2427.92
like it doesn't work

2425.359 --> 2428.48
right i might feel something for them

2427.92 --> 2431.76
but not

2428.48 --> 2432.16
attraction it doesn't work it's it's not

2431.76 --> 2434.96
even

2432.16 --> 2437.52
it's about the spirit it's just i'm

2434.96 --> 2442.079
attracted to spirit

2437.52 --> 2442.079
female spirit the real thing

2443.2 --> 2452.319
30 a.d spirit management what

2447.2 --> 2455.04
hello the mighty nigel

2452.319 --> 2455.92
yeah tiny womble that that's really nice

2455.04 --> 2466.8
yeah

2455.92 --> 2469.2000000000003
go back to the 70s

2466.8 --> 2470.079
most attractive women behave like

2469.2 --> 2472.319
children

2470.079 --> 2472.319
what

2473.76 --> 2478.0
oh you mean like the really beautiful

2478.839 --> 2483.839
ones

2481.119 --> 2486.7200000000003
well they're really stuck in the whole

2483.839 --> 2490.96
shitty paradigm anyway

2486.72 --> 2490.9599999999996
like they constantly get manipulated by

2492.839 --> 2495.839
everyone

2499.52 --> 2502.72
like most of the really beautiful women

2502.4 --> 2506.0
are

2502.72 --> 2508.72
like traumatized

2506.0 --> 2511.28
not necessarily from a very very young

2508.72 --> 2514.319
age on but they just get like that

2511.28 --> 2514.3190000000004
it's very tough

2516.48 --> 2520.0
because like for a very beautiful woman

2519.599 --> 2523.52
it's

2520.0 --> 2527.119
very tough to find people

2523.52 --> 2528.96
that can see you for the spirited person

2527.119 --> 2532.0
inside and not just

2528.96 --> 2533.76
like wow this is amazing i could get

2532.0 --> 2537.68
something out of it whether it's like

2533.76 --> 2540.96
financial advertisement social power

2537.68 --> 2543.359
or sex right

2540.96 --> 2544.16
their beauty is always distracting away

2543.359 --> 2547.52
from what

2544.16 --> 2550.7999999999997
they feel inside with other people in

2547.52 --> 2553.599
social situation and that's like

2550.8 --> 2557.2000000000003
it's like this unseen totally

2553.599 --> 2557.2000000000003
misunderstood isolation

2559.52 --> 2564.72
right this is the one thing also with my

2562.839 --> 2567.52
ex-girlfriend

2564.72 --> 2569.2
where i totally got that because she was

2567.52 --> 2572.24
freaking amazing

2569.2 --> 2577.7599999999998
like so gorgeous

2572.24 --> 2582.24
right but she really just

2577.76 --> 2582.2400000000002
wanted to just be

2582.8 --> 2588.0
her spirit self

2585.839 --> 2590.72
and that was kind of like almost

2588.0 --> 2590.72
impossible

2591.119 --> 2593.839
but i tried

2594.24 --> 2599.2
and then eventually it ended up like her

2597.04 --> 2607.839
trying to freaking get sex from me

2599.2 --> 2607.839
instead of the other way around

2609.119 --> 2621.44
but that's all that's all

2612.72 --> 2623.1189999999997
more than a decade ago by now

2621.44 --> 2625.839
tell me about it handsome men have the

2623.119 --> 2628.96
same issue oh i didn't know you were

2625.839 --> 2628.96
a handsome fellow

2630.96 --> 2638.48
but yes although i think for men it's

2634.96 --> 2640.16
less of a hassle except if gays are into

2638.48 --> 2641.76
you as well then it really becomes

2640.16 --> 2649.839
annoying

2641.76 --> 2649.8390000000004
trust me

2651.04 --> 2657.119
emotionally young i missed your question

2658.319 --> 2663.839

2772.839 --> 2775.839
hmm

2779.76 --> 2783.119
right yes christopher newton look with

2782.64 --> 2785.5989999999997
me

2783.119 --> 2787.28
i've even had like in that same time

2785.599 --> 2790.6400000000003
period where i did that no

2787.28 --> 2792.88
guess what everybody that [ __ ] thing

2790.64 --> 2794.4
spreads like a plague and then everybody

2792.88 --> 2796.4
thought i was gay

2794.4 --> 2798.079
just because i kissed that guy one time

2796.4 --> 2803.04
and like visibly got

2798.079 --> 2806.2400000000002
sick from it right well they didn't care

2803.04 --> 2809.52
like they were all pretty desperate

2806.24 --> 2812.3999999999996
and i was just overall trying to be a

2809.52 --> 2813.28
nice polite guy i was just kind of

2812.4 --> 2816.96
trying to be

2813.28 --> 2819.28
like this like i am with less rage by

2816.96 --> 2819.28
the way

2820.64 --> 2825.1189999999997
and like even like when i was just being

2823.119 --> 2825.6800000000003
nice to a guy that just happens to be

2825.119 --> 2828.1600000000003
gay

2825.68 --> 2828.7999999999997
like he kind of took it like oh that

2828.16 --> 2832.16
means

2828.8 --> 2835.52
i can now pick up on you it's like

2832.16 --> 2836.24
like really annoying for just trying to

2835.52 --> 2837.68
be nice

2836.24 --> 2839.839
and then they would like try to make

2837.68 --> 2843.5989999999997
moves on you ugh

2839.839 --> 2844.0
and like don't want to blame him it's

2843.599 --> 2859.839
just

2844.0 --> 2859.839
really repulsive

2863.28 --> 2873.8390000000004
all right

2877.839 --> 2882.48
but it's also the the more repulsive

2880.16 --> 2884.72
thing was just the general sense of a

2882.48 --> 2889.839
lack of respect

2884.72 --> 2893.5989999999997
for people's spirit that basically

2889.839 --> 2896.0
followed that around and

2893.599 --> 2897.599
like at some point i like really got fed

2896.0 --> 2899.839
up with that [ __ ]

2897.599 --> 2901.839
i would like get like don't [ __ ] do

2899.839 --> 2906.88
that again or i'm gonna really

2901.839 --> 2906.88
like hate you and you don't want that

2906.96 --> 2910.7200000000003
right it's not gonna be a fun oh imagine

2910.0 --> 2914.559
whatever

2910.72 --> 2915.04
sexy dungeon no like it's just going to

2914.559 --> 2917.6800000000003
be

2915.04 --> 2918.8
really [ __ ] you up in a bad way

2917.68 --> 2921.2799999999997
non-physical

2918.8 --> 2922.48
in the spirit so don't [ __ ] do that

2921.28 --> 2926.3190000000004
again

2922.48 --> 2926.319
like leave me the [ __ ] alone

2927.44 --> 2933.68
right and if you can do that then

2930.48 --> 2936.88
i can be a nice polite person

2933.68 --> 2937.7599999999998
again even be somewhat gallant at a

2936.88 --> 2940.0
distance

2937.76 --> 2943.8390000000004
don't make that move again i literally

2940.0 --> 2943.839
had to do that with some people

2944.8 --> 2952.079
and they were like all hurt over it

2948.24 --> 2957.839
but they were wise enough to let it go

2952.079 --> 2957.8390000000004
thank god

2964.24 --> 2969.4399999999996
i don't get uncomfortable at it well i

2966.0 --> 2973.76
don't really get uncomfortable at all

2969.44 --> 2976.319
i well it's like not like i'm

2973.76 --> 2979.8390000000004
become unsecure right i don't become

2976.319 --> 2982.72
insecure when it happens it's just that

2979.839 --> 2984.0
i just really don't want that and i

2982.72 --> 2986.72
don't want to tolerate

2984.0 --> 2988.4
it either right i don't want to just let

2986.72 --> 2990.319
them

2988.4 --> 2991.599
do what they can't help themselves or

2990.319 --> 2999.839
something no no

2991.599 --> 2999.839
just get away get away from me

3001.92 --> 3009.52
ew christopher newton that's that's

3006.4 --> 3012.319
yeah i'm not surprised

3009.52 --> 3012.96
because yeah that was exactly the same

3012.319 --> 3016.48
like

3012.96 --> 3016.48
yeah they're insane

3016.96 --> 3023.599
it's and evil

3020.24 --> 3024.319
it's evil they don't they probably don't

3023.599 --> 3026.88
know it

3024.319 --> 3027.599
but they'll feel it they're out of their

3026.88 --> 3030.88
minds

3027.599 --> 3030.88
it's it's insane

3036.559 --> 3040.8
and i'm done with that right when i

3038.559 --> 3042.8
started to notice that that effect

3040.8 --> 3043.8390000000004
like literally converting straight man

3042.8 --> 3046.48
to gay

3043.839 --> 3048.5589999999997
like that's a that's like a spiritual

3046.48 --> 3050.8
plague out there it's satanic

3048.559 --> 3052.3190000000004
and i don't give a [ __ ] what that means

3050.8 --> 3056.1600000000003
to you

3052.319 --> 3059.52
it's what it is it's what it is to me

3056.16 --> 3060.7999999999997
and when i figure that out that was kind

3059.52 --> 3064.96
of the point where i

3060.8 --> 3067.6800000000003
really start also to step out of well

3064.96 --> 3068.079
that specific god god scene there's many

3067.68 --> 3070.64
different

3068.079 --> 3071.8390000000004
scenes out there but where there was a

3070.64 --> 3074.48
lot of that

3071.839 --> 3076.5589999999997
i stepped out of that it was like i

3074.48 --> 3078.0
really don't want to associate with this

3076.559 --> 3081.6800000000003
[ __ ] anymore like you

3078.0 --> 3084.8
are disgusting and evil

3081.68 --> 3088.8799999999997
and not like

3084.8 --> 3088.88
this is not gonna lead to anything good

3092.16 --> 3096.24
like not even if i do keep my distance

3094.88 --> 3111.839
just i don't want

3096.24 --> 3111.839
i don't want to be close to this anymore

3112.8 --> 3125.8390000000004
ah trailer for level

3116.319 --> 3125.839
okay a trailer

3136.839 --> 3144.5589999999997
what

3139.119 --> 3144.559
okay let me take a quick glance at that

3150.839 --> 3153.839
trailer

3164.839 --> 3169.52
goodie

3166.079 --> 3171.76
okay well i'm not listening to it but

3169.52 --> 3174.24
from the footage i've seen that i don't

3171.76 --> 3174.2400000000002
know what

3177.599 --> 3182.88
don't get the impression it's like

3180.48 --> 3185.599
really bad

3182.88 --> 3185.599
like i see

3189.28 --> 3197.3590000000004
eddie bravo in there

3194.4 --> 3199.44
so this might be kind of like a neutral

3197.359 --> 3202.24
an attempt to neutral perspective or

3199.44 --> 3202.2400000000002
something i don't know

3206.319 --> 3209.839
april 22nd

3212.72 --> 3223.839
all right

3234.839 --> 3237.839
ah

3260.3 --> 3264.94
[Music]

3262.839 --> 3272.499
uh

3264.94 --> 3272.4990000000003
[Music]

3276.4 --> 3293.839
oh that's is it the way film is it from

3278.88 --> 3293.839
eric to bay

3318.839 --> 3321.839
one

3323.359 --> 3327.44
eric dubai narrates it okay so he's like

3326.0 --> 3330.72
part of it it's not his

3327.44 --> 3333.2000000000003
film i take it it's just being part of a

3330.72 --> 3333.2
project

3333.359 --> 3349.839
or did he also organize it

3360.839 --> 3363.839
uh

3370.079 --> 3373.2000000000003
yeah hello by the way seeking star wars

3371.76 --> 3377.8390000000004
i did spot you of course

3373.2 --> 3380.48
since you brought the trailer

3377.839 --> 3382.88
you organize okay well we'll see it's

3380.48 --> 3391.839
coming out in like six days

3382.88 --> 3391.839
so yeah

3395.11 --> 3398.289
[Music]

3405.98 --> 3410.469
[Music]

3413.98 --> 3417.059
[Music]

3418.559 --> 3422.0
right super straight after yeah sure

3420.16 --> 3426.319
i'll watch it too it depends though

3422.0 --> 3426.319
how long it is if it's really long then

3427.28 --> 3435.2000000000003
i don't know i think it will be well

3431.28 --> 3435.2000000000003
received it all depends on the spread

3437.359 --> 3447.359
received by who the flat earth community

3441.04 --> 3450.48
the internet the world

3447.359 --> 3452.319
the world is just going to ignore it

3450.48 --> 3454.559
the ones that don't want to associate

3452.319 --> 3455.7599999999998
with flat earth are just going to ignore

3454.559 --> 3458.7200000000003
it

3455.76 --> 3459.76
it's not going to be on a netflix right

3458.72 --> 3462.9599999999996
so it's not going to

3459.76 --> 3475.8390000000004
have the same kind of reach as beyond

3462.96 --> 3475.839
the curve

3479.28 --> 3486.88
right territory i'll say well

3482.72 --> 3486.8799999999997
by scientism okay

3487.119 --> 3491.359
well i'm very curious if he's gonna just

3489.119 --> 3495.6800000000003
put in like the housekeeping questions

3491.359 --> 3495.68
in there he would be very smart too

3496.319 --> 3503.839
to just put that in there complete

3514.839 --> 3517.839
ah

3523.599 --> 3531.839
right anyway so yeah can we

3527.68 --> 3531.839
pick up on another subject perhaps

3548.16 --> 3555.04
got almost 30 watching i think

3551.839 --> 3555.68
so yeah i'll pick up on on whatever

3555.04 --> 3557.92
subject

3555.68 --> 3559.52
is there something that happens like

3557.92 --> 3562.559
yesterday or whatever

3559.52 --> 3573.839
out there on another channel

3562.559 --> 3573.8390000000004
that you think might be noteworthy

3575.839 --> 3587.839
hey julio pabin good to see you

3599.359 --> 3606.88
enough that's a vaccine yeah

3602.48 --> 3606.88
ralph well over here too

3607.04 --> 3613.52
it's like it's almost even like

3610.64 --> 3614.72
the mainstream narrative is also trying

3613.52 --> 3618.72
to slight

3614.72 --> 3618.72
slide to

3619.04 --> 3624.4
like maybe they're finally just

3621.44 --> 3627.599
relinquishing that they can't uphold the

3624.4 --> 3630.48
the full propaganda image any longer

3627.599 --> 3631.839
like they know it's like this is all

3630.48 --> 3634.799
terrible

3631.839 --> 3635.2799999999997
a terrible situation propaganda wise and

3634.799 --> 3638.079
people

3635.28 --> 3638.96
are going to be held accountable i think

3638.079 --> 3643.44
that's now

3638.96 --> 3647.2
sinking in re for real

3643.44 --> 3647.2000000000003
tension is going up

3648.799 --> 3656.88
but guys i literally feel it

3652.24 --> 3660.0
that's part of what's going on with me

3656.88 --> 3665.2000000000003
it's why i basically start

3660.0 --> 3665.2
declaring yeah pretty radical things

3665.52 --> 3669.119
it's radical to do that even though i'm

3668.4 --> 3672.2400000000002
pretty sure

3669.119 --> 3673.28
it's on a lot of people's minds or it's

3672.24 --> 3676.0789999999997
going to be

3673.28 --> 3678.0
on a lot of people's minds that's why i

3676.079 --> 3679.3590000000004
do it it's the canary in the coal mine

3678.0 --> 3682.88
when i say these things

3679.359 --> 3684.88
is not something oh look i have secretly

3682.88 --> 3687.92
made this plan

3684.88 --> 3692.319
and organize organize

3687.92 --> 3692.7200000000003
me really no that's me oracling that's

3692.319 --> 3695.44
me

3692.72 --> 3696.72
looking into a piece into the future

3695.44 --> 3700.2400000000002
basically saying

3696.72 --> 3702.72
okay guys whatever you're gonna do

3700.24 --> 3703.839
be quick because this is going to be the

3702.72 --> 3707.7599999999998
next option

3703.839 --> 3708.64
if you don't right and just constantly

3707.76 --> 3712.079
sliding that

3708.64 --> 3714.319
forward just to show you

3712.079 --> 3717.2000000000003
like like yeah this is serious this is

3714.319 --> 3717.2
not the time to

3717.92 --> 3724.0
to take a vacation or what's how are you

3720.96 --> 3724.0
gonna take a vacation

3724.839 --> 3730.64
right there's a lot of

3727.2 --> 3732.8799999999997
it's a big mess out there and it has to

3730.64 --> 3732.8799999999997
be

3733.76 --> 3736.4
resolved

3736.96 --> 3743.359
by the people

3740.16 --> 3745.92
not by the controlling

3743.359 --> 3746.96
government and corporation heads that

3745.92 --> 3750.799
are actually

3746.96 --> 3752.88
creating the problem like we cannot let

3750.799 --> 3757.119
these people

3752.88 --> 3757.119
have the reigns anymore

3758.72 --> 3762.8799999999997
because they will never stop they don't

3762.319 --> 3765.599
care

3762.88 --> 3767.119
how bad the lies are that they are

3765.599 --> 3771.52
enrolling on you

3767.119 --> 3775.359
and they will increase in how bad it is

3771.52 --> 3779.2
to unheard of levels

3775.359 --> 3782.0789999999997
unheard of levels so there is literally

3779.2 --> 3783.359
no choice to there is no long-term plan

3782.079 --> 3786.079
to go along to get along

3783.359 --> 3787.5989999999997
it doesn't exist that plan is literally

3786.079 --> 3789.92
death

3787.599 --> 3791.92
right and i'm trying to get through to a

3789.92 --> 3794.559
lot of people

3791.92 --> 3796.88
even though they might not be listening

3794.559 --> 3799.2000000000003
literally to me

3796.88 --> 3800.319
maybe they're hearing it through the

3799.2 --> 3803.5989999999997
other dimension

3800.319 --> 3805.0389999999998
which i definitely touch on a regular

3803.599 --> 3807.599
basis

3805.039 --> 3811.8390000000004
i'm playing my tune on the other side

3807.599 --> 3811.839
i'm doing my thing there

3818.88 --> 3823.599
yeah clutch bear look the united states

3821.44 --> 3829.039
is just

3823.599 --> 3829.039
it's so messy now it's just

3835.76 --> 3838.7990000000004
but yeah in the netherlands there's also

3837.44 --> 3842.7200000000003
issues they're they're

3838.799 --> 3846.319
they're slowly but gradually trying to

3842.72 --> 3848.64
like worsen the rules i think they now

3846.319 --> 3852.0
want like

3848.64 --> 3855.839
forced like locked

3852.0 --> 3859.52
like locked down what was it again

3855.839 --> 3859.52
you say this in english hold on

3864.079 --> 3871.6800000000003
right mandatory entrance tests

3868.319 --> 3873.2
so literally like do a test or you can't

3871.68 --> 3875.9199999999996
get in

3873.2 --> 3876.319
apparently this is now going to happen

3875.92 --> 3880.079
with

3876.319 --> 3882.16
theater like theater out there

3880.079 --> 3883.119
of course yeah but i'm not going there

3882.16 --> 3886.24
anyway

3883.119 --> 3889.839
but like yeah constantly

3886.24 --> 3894.4799999999996
it just they're not

3889.839 --> 3898.72
allowing you to just

3894.48 --> 3902.319
reap the luxury benefits

3898.72 --> 3903.4399999999996
of a grand society with big things

3902.319 --> 3905.7599999999998
places you can go

3903.44 --> 3907.359
they're not allowing you to do that

3905.76 --> 3910.1600000000003
anymore without

3907.359 --> 3910.799
eventually going to the slaughterhouse

3910.16 --> 3915.44
they're not

3910.799 --> 3918.72
allowing you to take the benefits

3915.44 --> 3921.839
of the remnants of the larger

3918.72 --> 3923.2
society benefits right like big places

3921.839 --> 3925.92
theaters all that

3923.2 --> 3926.319
restaurants they don't want you to have

3925.92 --> 3929.2000000000003
this

3926.319 --> 3929.2
and survive

3930.0 --> 3937.28
so there it's like very

3933.68 --> 3939.52
in between

3937.28 --> 3941.92
you can do without it survive they're

3939.52 --> 3944.24
gonna leave it survivable

3941.92 --> 3946.0
if you want anything more than just

3944.24 --> 3948.5589999999997
survivable

3946.0 --> 3950.72
they only allow you to go there by

3948.559 --> 3955.599
killing yourself

3950.72 --> 3955.5989999999997
that's what seems to be the plan

3957.839 --> 3965.839
and i don't know how to stop it

3962.96 --> 3966.559
except for well jihad what would the end

3965.839 --> 3968.48
result be

3966.559 --> 3969.92
it would lead to the total trashing of

3968.48 --> 3979.839
it all anyway so

3969.92 --> 3979.839
hey alternative plan would be great

3984.96 --> 3987.599
because yeah

3990.839 --> 3993.839
just

3994.319 --> 3999.119
how do you get all these conspirators

3996.799 --> 4002.72
out of the way

3999.119 --> 4005.28
and then basically pick up where we all

4002.72 --> 4008.5589999999997
left off before this started to happen

4005.28 --> 4011.599
before all the propaganda and the

4008.559 --> 4015.3590000000004
narrative lies started to

4011.599 --> 4018.559
unravel everything if

4015.359 --> 4021.0389999999998
we like literally outlaw that

4018.559 --> 4022.48
not that that's going to be really

4021.039 --> 4024.3190000000004
possible at least not here in the

4022.48 --> 4024.799
netherlands i think although who knows

4024.319 --> 4029.44
man

4024.799 --> 4032.88
eventually maybe we will get there

4029.44 --> 4034.16
can we just pick up the pieces where we

4032.88 --> 4038.559
left off

4034.16 --> 4042.24
or is it going to be gone are the people

4038.559 --> 4045.44
that made part of this possible the ones

4042.24 --> 4047.839
that have destroyed it because then

4045.44 --> 4048.96
they will be gone the ones that were

4047.839 --> 4053.2799999999997
upholding it

4048.96 --> 4055.52
right i don't have a full oversight over

4053.28 --> 4055.52
this

4056.0 --> 4059.28
it really the entire thing effectively

4058.72 --> 4063.839
is like

4059.28 --> 4063.8390000000004
a madness self-destruction

4077.44 --> 4081.119
what the [ __ ] youtube

4088.24 --> 4092.16
right well clutch bear yeah well look

4090.48 --> 4094.319
i'm mostly referring to

4092.16 --> 4096.0
my little country now in the united

4094.319 --> 4099.2789999999995
states

4096.0 --> 4099.279
it's different

4099.6 --> 4102.799
it's deeper into the [ __ ] but it's also

4102.4 --> 4106.799
with

4102.799 --> 4106.799
more room for still some

4110.159 --> 4119.839
well for some real self-sufficiency

4121.6 --> 4126.88
right but i agree no despair

4124.96 --> 4129.52
what does that even mean you know what

4126.88 --> 4132.56
is despair

4129.52 --> 4137.4400000000005
for real and why is it dangerous

4132.56 --> 4139.759
right because is being afraid despair

4137.44 --> 4139.759
is

4141.12 --> 4146.64
being stressed out or bothered by the

4144.319 --> 4149.6
influence of what you know is going on

4146.64 --> 4149.6
is that despair

4150.48 --> 4160.0
i don't think so despair

4155.199 --> 4164.08
is rather break of courage

4160.0 --> 4166.56
right because yeah you might be stuck

4164.08 --> 4167.44
in wanting to resist not really

4166.56 --> 4170.4800000000005
effectively

4167.44 --> 4173.04
knowing how to get it away

4170.48 --> 4175.12
you can only defend against it well

4173.04 --> 4176.719
that's not despair even though you might

4175.12 --> 4180.159
have a lot of side effects

4176.719 --> 4183.839
of just the powerlessness that hurts

4180.159 --> 4186.5599999999995
but real despair is when you basically

4183.839 --> 4188.0
give up on defending against it because

4186.56 --> 4190.96
you just don't want to know it

4188.0 --> 4191.44
exists anymore so you erase it and with

4190.96 --> 4194.88
that

4191.44 --> 4194.879999999999
basically let it in

4196.96 --> 4200.2390000000005
that's the real despair a real despair

4199.92 --> 4203.28
is

4200.239 --> 4207.04
giving up

4203.28 --> 4207.04
because you think it's too much

4209.679 --> 4214.0
and with giving up it also doesn't mean

4212.32 --> 4216.88
stepping away for a few

4214.0 --> 4218.719
right look you can get very stressed out

4216.88 --> 4219.12
like i don't even freaking step away i

4218.719 --> 4221.52
just

4219.12 --> 4224.08
start to go a rage win right that's what

4221.52 --> 4226.080000000001
i do because i'm really stubborn i don't

4224.08 --> 4228.719
stop doing my daily show

4226.08 --> 4230.08
no matter what no matter how crazy it

4228.719 --> 4233.44
freaking gets i'm not

4230.08 --> 4236.4
stopping it right

4233.44 --> 4236.4
it's my decision

4236.64 --> 4242.159000000001
but it's not unreasonable and if

4239.84 --> 4243.28
in the swing of the pendulum you get

4242.159 --> 4246.5599999999995
really down

4243.28 --> 4247.12
where you can't wheel it for a period

4246.56 --> 4251.360000000001
that you

4247.12 --> 4254.0
drop it to the side don't over focus

4251.36 --> 4255.839999999999
on it and the developments involving it

4254.0 --> 4258.96
and kind of take a break

4255.84 --> 4262.719
right that's not giving it up and

4258.96 --> 4265.76
letting it in even now that's once

4262.719 --> 4267.92
that despair is even one step further

4265.76 --> 4270.64
where you don't only give it up

4267.92 --> 4272.64
then you're like i never want to

4270.64 --> 4276.64
remember this ever happened

4272.64 --> 4278.56
real despair is basically like cipher

4276.64 --> 4279.92
wanting to get re-injected into the

4278.56 --> 4283.6
matrix

4279.92 --> 4283.6
that's actual despair

4285.679 --> 4292.0
right that's despair really

4288.8 --> 4293.52
at the core it doesn't even show it's

4292.0 --> 4297.199
not

4293.52 --> 4302.64
visceral it's despair that's so bad

4297.199 --> 4305.44
you give up you retreat to a fantasy

4302.64 --> 4306.159000000001
and through that fantasy you let the

4305.44 --> 4309.599999999999
darkness

4306.159 --> 4312.08
the threat take control that's the real

4309.6 --> 4314.719
despair

4312.08 --> 4317.199
it's very important to feel the

4314.719 --> 4317.199
difference

4319.04 --> 4329.84
am i am i being understood clutch bear

4322.32 --> 4329.84
do you understand what i mean

4334.719 --> 4340.96
complete loss or absence of hope no no

4337.84 --> 4343.04
you can lose hope at some point

4340.96 --> 4345.36
but that's just losing the energy that's

4343.04 --> 4347.6
effectively like a moment of depression

4345.36 --> 4347.599999999999
right

4348.56 --> 4356.320000000001
the real despair comes when you take

4352.48 --> 4358.879999999999
actions to grow

4356.32 --> 4362.08
from that position on is where you

4358.88 --> 4364.08
literally start engaging

4362.08 --> 4365.5599999999995
from a position of ignorance because you

4364.08 --> 4367.6
don't want to deal with the

4365.56 --> 4369.6
responsibility of having to be

4367.6 --> 4370.4800000000005
confronted with it and defending against

4369.6 --> 4373.92
it anymore

4370.48 --> 4373.919999999999
that's the true despair

4375.199 --> 4379.04
feeling a loss or absence of hope is

4377.92 --> 4383.1990000000005
just

4379.04 --> 4385.92
kind of like depression and people

4383.199 --> 4386.719
arrive to that point sometimes based on

4385.92 --> 4389.1990000000005
the

4386.719 --> 4390.96
friction of the events how wild things

4389.199 --> 4394.5599999999995
have swinged

4390.96 --> 4398.08
in the emotions but

4394.56 --> 4398.88
that's not necessarily despair it's just

4398.08 --> 4401.12
a moment

4398.88 --> 4401.12
of

4402.4 --> 4406.08
where you just feel really bad about it

4404.4 --> 4408.159
but as long as you just

4406.08 --> 4410.08
what i learned with that and i don't

4408.159 --> 4410.48
really have these moments anymore like

4410.08 --> 4412.8
that

4410.48 --> 4414.08
thank god i don't depression really

4412.8 --> 4417.1990000000005
sucks

4414.08 --> 4420.8
when you have it i learned early on

4417.199 --> 4424.879999999999
just don't act on it whatever you do

4420.8 --> 4427.92
whatever crazy idea comes to mind that

4424.88 --> 4430.719
basically is fed into by the need for

4427.92 --> 4431.1990000000005
further escape deeper escape just don't

4430.719 --> 4435.36
do

4431.199 --> 4438.879999999999
anything that comes to mind

4435.36 --> 4440.48
when you're depressed really comes down

4438.88 --> 4444.56
to that don't ever

4440.48 --> 4447.5199999999995
act on thoughts that come in

4444.56 --> 4447.52
during depression

4447.84 --> 4455.1990000000005
because that's how you eventually

4451.199 --> 4457.839999999999
get lured into despair

4455.199 --> 4459.159
right it's like it's not a luciferian

4457.84 --> 4461.52
seduction it's an

4459.159 --> 4464.32
aramanian seduction when you're

4461.52 --> 4468.56
depressed iriman

4464.32 --> 4471.759999999999
comes and seduces you death itself

4468.56 --> 4475.1990000000005
giving up the perfect delusion right

4471.76 --> 4478.64
surrender to death for pure

4475.199 --> 4481.919999999999
blissful ignorance and

4478.64 --> 4485.92
it's all a lie in the end like even that

4481.92 --> 4485.92
blissful ignorance is a complete lie

4486.719 --> 4490.4
because you're not gonna be blissfully

4488.239 --> 4494.639999999999
ignorant in the end when you do that

4490.4 --> 4497.839999999999
no you're not absolute torture

4494.64 --> 4497.84
that's where that leads to

4498.4 --> 4500.639999999999
right

4503.6 --> 4508.8
that is the definition of despair okay

4505.44 --> 4511.839999999999
okay well george sanford

4508.8 --> 4511.84
maybe i'm

4524.64 --> 4528.96
complete loss or absent but but complete

4527.36 --> 4531.04
loss or absent of hope

4528.96 --> 4532.88
does not imply that you could never get

4531.04 --> 4536.32
it back again

4532.88 --> 4539.84
it right so that's depression

4536.32 --> 4539.84
and depression doesn't

4540.239 --> 4547.36
it like i always saw despair as

4544.0 --> 4550.239
an action towards the darkness

4547.36 --> 4551.04
right it's like by accident it's the the

4550.239 --> 4554.959999999999
wrong

4551.04 --> 4558.56
feed fear ego

4554.96 --> 4562.08
all those the darkness drives you to do

4558.56 --> 4565.4400000000005
something that to me seems like despair

4562.08 --> 4567.76
but maybe i'm just like

4565.44 --> 4568.639999999999
following some kind of spiritual

4567.76 --> 4571.679
mechanism

4568.64 --> 4575.04
mechanism in this train of thinking

4571.679 --> 4575.04
not the original word

4576.159 --> 4582.719
i don't know is anybody following this

4579.52 --> 4582.719
can i have some feedback

4584.239 --> 4587.919999999999
i'm just gonna run it run into a ditch

4586.96 --> 4592.4
with this

4587.92 --> 4595.84
concept anybody following can i get some

4592.4 --> 4595.839999999999
feedback in chat please

4608.64 --> 4612.8
depression is more anti-motivation

4616.159 --> 4621.199
good point when i'm depressed i do

4620.239 --> 4637.839999999999
nothing

4621.199 --> 4637.839999999999
but you've never had it worse than that

4638.239 --> 4650.879999999999
i don't want your feedback tinyomo okay

4640.8 --> 4653.4400000000005
if you say so

4650.88 --> 4654.0
well pierre i don't know you so your

4653.44 --> 4655.759999999999
opinion

4654.0 --> 4659.199
doesn't really matter i'm talking about

4655.76 --> 4662.2390000000005
people that i actually know

4659.199 --> 4666.48
that i know know me right

4662.239 --> 4666.48
not some random person out there

4669.04 --> 4679.84
we have anxiety

4672.159 --> 4679.839999999999
is do stupid things all right

4680.239 --> 4684.48
okay then maybe what i was trying to

4682.159 --> 4688.239
describe is like a combination of

4684.48 --> 4688.239
of depression and anxiety

4688.88 --> 4698.4800000000005
because that would certainly fulfill the

4694.8 --> 4698.96
yeah the requirements to start engaging

4698.48 --> 4707.839999999999
into

4698.96 --> 4707.84
really bad romanian things

4712.239 --> 4717.5199999999995
we are splitting hairs okay fair enough

4714.32 --> 4717.5199999999995
clutch bear fair enough

4718.56 --> 4723.84
but it is kind of important to clear up

4721.28 --> 4728.08
the details on this right to basically

4723.84 --> 4728.08
refine the understanding

4728.159 --> 4732.08
depression can be diet related

4732.88 --> 4739.6
i'm we're not talking about the causes

4736.4 --> 4743.599999999999
of depression or the swings it wasn't

4739.6 --> 4747.04
i'm just talking about what is despair

4743.6 --> 4749.84
how do you regard despair and like

4747.04 --> 4749.84
passivity

4750.239 --> 4754.959999999999
to me doesn't really fight with despair

4753.36 --> 4758.08
despair is really like the

4754.96 --> 4761.04
action further into the darkness like

4758.08 --> 4762.32
desperate actions lead to chaos and

4761.04 --> 4766.239
destruction

4762.32 --> 4776.5599999999995
right desperate despair

4766.239 --> 4780.959999999999
desperate action

4776.56 --> 4781.9800000000005
right but yeah splitting errors perhaps

4780.96 --> 4784.88
anyway uh

4781.98 --> 4791.839999999999
[Music]

4784.88 --> 4791.84
be right back in two minutes

4792.98 --> 4796.04
[Music]

4886.84 --> 4891.4400000000005
hmm

4888.719 --> 4894.4
right yeah moth eyes okay well if you

4891.44 --> 4894.4
want to talk about it

4896.08 --> 4903.44
every time i risk being depressed

4900.0 --> 4906.56
or basically i run out of energy

4903.44 --> 4909.759999999999
feed to get creative

4906.56 --> 4912.2390000000005
to even to help focus it even takes away

4909.76 --> 4915.360000000001
ability to help focus

4912.239 --> 4915.36
my solution would be

4915.6 --> 4923.360000000001
to whenever i would get anxiety

4919.76 --> 4926.639
like do a lot of walking like

4923.36 --> 4929.5199999999995
exercise it out of me and

4926.639 --> 4930.56
a lot of walking is like a bit of a

4929.52 --> 4933.120000000001
overstatement

4930.56 --> 4935.4400000000005
like i would just like go out and walk

4933.12 --> 4938.0
maybe half an hour

4935.44 --> 4938.879999999999
that would but i would basically have to

4938.0 --> 4942.0
address it

4938.88 --> 4944.8
quickly and not which typically

4942.0 --> 4946.719
coincides with depression try to ignore

4944.8 --> 4951.52
it exists

4946.719 --> 4955.44
passivity right so to act on that

4951.52 --> 4959.120000000001
quickly get it out physically right

4955.44 --> 4961.04
funnily enough i i noticed this

4959.12 --> 4962.239
this mechanism through my mother because

4961.04 --> 4965.12
she also

4962.239 --> 4965.12
had periods

4965.36 --> 4971.12
like that she had anxiety at times

4969.36 --> 4973.44
especially when she was under a lot of

4971.12 --> 4976.48
pressure and she took way too much

4973.44 --> 4978.32
stuff on her shoulders like way too much

4976.48 --> 4982.718999999999
insane like people would warn her and

4978.32 --> 4982.719
she'd do it anyway stupid stubborn woman

4985.36 --> 4989.12
and another important thing indeed is

4987.92 --> 4992.8
diet

4989.12 --> 4994.0
so i learned that everything depression

4992.8 --> 4997.12
related

4994.0 --> 5000.88
with me can be salvaged

4997.12 --> 5003.04
pretty quickly by taking fish oil good

5000.88 --> 5005.84
quality fish oil very important

5003.04 --> 5010.0
now you might eating good quality

5005.84 --> 5010.0
organic fish might also do the trick

5010.08 --> 5016.5599999999995
but that really worked for me

5013.199 --> 5019.759999999999
like using fish oil really got me out of

5016.56 --> 5020.8
like the worst of my averaging

5019.76 --> 5024.159000000001
depression

5020.8 --> 5027.28
state because

5024.159 --> 5029.92
i am a lot more vibrant now than i was

5027.28 --> 5032.8
10 years ago

5029.92 --> 5033.1990000000005
although well it was with my ex too and

5032.8 --> 5036.320000000001
say

5033.199 --> 5038.0
15 and 20 years ago like i was

5036.32 --> 5043.12
considered to be

5038.0 --> 5045.52
like a depressed person

5043.12 --> 5046.8
and i was compared to now i was

5045.52 --> 5049.040000000001
depressed

5046.8 --> 5051.1990000000005
and in a way i sometimes forget you know

5049.04 --> 5054.48
you start to take

5051.199 --> 5058.5599999999995
what you get for granted

5054.48 --> 5062.32
but flat earth was a big part in that

5058.56 --> 5066.719
it's a big big part in me like really

5062.32 --> 5070.4
stepping out of the passivity depression

5066.719 --> 5073.84
social societal

5070.4 --> 5076.48
by basically engaging with this

5073.84 --> 5078.2390000000005
developing social skills even through

5076.48 --> 5080.799999999999
the internet

5078.239 --> 5081.599999999999
and this like this alternative

5080.8 --> 5084.96
collective

5081.6 --> 5088.400000000001
project of mine like

5084.96 --> 5090.88
communism betrayed me i thought

5088.4 --> 5093.199
at first it was good when i was young

5090.88 --> 5096.32
and as i grew older i was just

5093.199 --> 5099.5199999999995
highly disillusioned by it even though

5096.32 --> 5101.92
the original allure of it

5099.52 --> 5105.679
was very appealing to me and i am

5101.92 --> 5109.28
literally recreating it

5105.679 --> 5113.6
exactly i'm trying exactly the opposite

5109.28 --> 5115.92
of how it is being abused out there

5113.6 --> 5115.92
right

5118.639 --> 5122.639
it i don't know maybe this doesn't make

5120.639 --> 5127.84
any damn sense to a lot of people what

5122.639 --> 5127.84
i'm say it's just

5128.56 --> 5133.04
they promised me something and that

5130.48 --> 5137.5199999999995
promise turned out to be a lie

5133.04 --> 5140.56
but why not turn what they promised

5137.52 --> 5141.84
and make it real anyway even though they

5140.56 --> 5147.6
don't want it

5141.84 --> 5147.6
right in the right way

5148.48 --> 5154.959999999999
not corrupted not reversed world not

5152.84 --> 5158.719
anti-biblical

5154.96 --> 5163.28
but just use that collective spirit

5158.719 --> 5163.28
which they abuse so painfully

5163.52 --> 5167.120000000001
and actually put it to humanity's

5165.52 --> 5170.719
benefit

5167.12 --> 5174.48
in the name of god it

5170.719 --> 5174.4800000000005
it's partially what i'm trying

5176.88 --> 5183.84
right anyway uh i've strayed a lot from

5179.76 --> 5183.84
what we're talking about

5191.52 --> 5196.88
sometimes when you get anxiety is due to

5193.6 --> 5199.280000000001
estrogen levels getting high okay

5196.88 --> 5199.28
all right

5200.8 --> 5204.56
but yes when in times when i feel really

5204.08 --> 5208.08
bad

5204.56 --> 5210.639
or like when i'm really hurt like

5208.08 --> 5212.159
when i broke up with my ex god it's been

5210.639 --> 5216.159000000001
like three years of

5212.159 --> 5219.28
hell because i was really

5216.159 --> 5223.199
really in love with her guys

5219.28 --> 5224.0
most i've ever been and i fall pretty

5223.199 --> 5229.12
deeply in love

5224.0 --> 5229.12
when i do and i can't stop myself

5230.56 --> 5236.2390000000005
and yeah after that

5233.679 --> 5237.6
breaks it's like nothing means anything

5236.239 --> 5241.36
anymore

5237.6 --> 5242.4800000000005
and then yeah despair like even action

5241.36 --> 5245.679
despair does

5242.48 --> 5248.718999999999
like everyone likes walks with you

5245.679 --> 5252.08
and it's like oh i can figure out

5248.719 --> 5255.6
ways you can end the suffering like very

5252.08 --> 5257.199
sadistically it's really messed up to

5255.6 --> 5261.120000000001
feel like that guys and

5257.199 --> 5264.159
it went to me to hallucinatory levels

5261.12 --> 5266.5599999999995
right especially right at the beginning

5264.159 --> 5267.44
when she broke up like i hallucinated a

5266.56 --> 5271.04
bunch of times

5267.44 --> 5272.48
really freaky like waking hallucinations

5271.04 --> 5280.32
and [ __ ]

5272.48 --> 5283.36
from pain okay don't recommend it

5280.32 --> 5286.32
ugh but yeah after that period

5283.36 --> 5288.32
feeling very depressed and all that yep

5286.32 --> 5291.44
moving around

5288.32 --> 5294.88
getting physical just walking

5291.44 --> 5298.08
also like testing your body is like am

5294.88 --> 5301.6
am i still complete

5298.08 --> 5304.32
like what do i still have just be honest

5301.6 --> 5308.4800000000005
about what do i still have

5304.32 --> 5310.48
right still had my health even though i

5308.48 --> 5312.799999999999
knew there was going to be a lot of

5310.48 --> 5314.48
psychosomatic backlash through german

5312.8 --> 5316.4800000000005
new medicine i already knew that

5314.48 --> 5318.638999999999
from the past because every time i went

5316.48 --> 5321.599999999999
through something really heavy emotional

5318.639 --> 5324.4800000000005
afterward i would get sick a lot

5321.6 --> 5325.6
and hey i learned afterwards through

5324.48 --> 5328.799999999999
germany medicine

5325.6 --> 5332.4800000000005
that that is a very specific function

5328.8 --> 5332.4800000000005
so i understand now why

5332.8 --> 5339.679
but yeah doing physical exercise

5336.08 --> 5341.04
very important when you're going through

5339.679 --> 5344.4800000000005
a depression

5341.04 --> 5344.48
because it keeps

5344.56 --> 5348.639
your your hormones is like a problem

5346.96 --> 5352.159
during depression

5348.639 --> 5354.96
and doing physical exercise kindness

5352.159 --> 5357.5599999999995
it keeps it going and stable might work

5354.96 --> 5360.56
towards

5357.56 --> 5360.56
stabilization

5360.8 --> 5365.84
brush your teeth with coconut oil oh

5362.639 --> 5365.84
yeah why not

5369.679 --> 5373.36
how's my shoulder oh thanks for asking

5371.52 --> 5374.719
to anyone but my shoulder is actually

5373.36 --> 5379.839999999999
really good

5374.719 --> 5379.84
it's funny because my shoulder is

5381.679 --> 5387.36
it's great it feels completely

5385.679 --> 5393.04
symmetrical

5387.36 --> 5395.679
no more weird things sticking out

5393.04 --> 5395.679
that's great

5398.8 --> 5405.52
yeah iron 26 well detoxing

5402.0 --> 5407.92
right but i or

5405.52 --> 5408.88
yeah if you've already detoxed before

5407.92 --> 5411.84
you enter

5408.88 --> 5413.92
such a state you don't really need to do

5411.84 --> 5416.32
it actually it's not like you suddenly

5413.92 --> 5418.88
contract all these

5416.32 --> 5419.44
all this heavy metals and garbage and

5418.88 --> 5422.32
poison

5419.44 --> 5425.199
right yeah you'll get some antihistamine

5422.32 --> 5428.239
and all that you get some hormonal

5425.199 --> 5429.28
poison but if you've already heavily

5428.239 --> 5431.199
detoxed

5429.28 --> 5433.5199999999995
before you got to such a state you don't

5431.199 --> 5437.599999999999
really need to do it extra

5433.52 --> 5437.6
you just need to keep your system going

5447.28 --> 5452.5599999999995
oh oh gaining wisdom that that's awesome

5451.04 --> 5456.96
that's that's really good to hear that

5452.56 --> 5456.96
you actually woke somebody up about that

5459.199 --> 5465.36
that's really awesome

5462.96 --> 5466.719
you might have literally just saved the

5465.36 --> 5470.719
pharmacist

5466.719 --> 5470.719
like from future persecution

5471.679 --> 5474.719
right because all of this [ __ ] is gonna

5474.4 --> 5477.36
have

5474.719 --> 5478.4800000000005
such a backlash guys you can't imagine

5477.36 --> 5482.96
it's gonna be like

5478.48 --> 5486.32
frightening when it starts to

5482.96 --> 5486.32
finally happen

5488.8 --> 5493.28
it's like she was waiting for a

5490.159 --> 5494.0
validation yes well then she really was

5493.28 --> 5497.12
just

5494.0 --> 5500.4
still a cog in the machine

5497.12 --> 5503.36
guided by good principles waiting

5500.4 --> 5504.638999999999
like doesn't make sense to me but this

5503.36 --> 5507.839999999999
is what i'm told

5504.639 --> 5509.84
and so yeah you told her the the things

5507.84 --> 5510.4800000000005
she needed to hear and now she knows

5509.84 --> 5514.56
like oh

5510.48 --> 5517.44
[ __ ] i'm a cog in the wrong machine

5514.56 --> 5518.639
that's that's really that's a really

5517.44 --> 5519.839999999999
good thing to hear

5518.639 --> 5521.76
thank you for sharing that gaining

5519.84 --> 5524.639
wisdom i really appreciate that that

5521.76 --> 5524.639
makes me feel good

5531.04 --> 5535.28
broke up with your crow over the vaccine

5533.6 --> 5538.8
damn

5535.28 --> 5547.28
ralph dude

5538.8 --> 5550.320000000001
that sucks bro what yeah

5547.28 --> 5552.88
it's it's

5550.32 --> 5553.759999999999
hard to say if it's worth it but from my

5552.88 --> 5558.159000000001
perspective

5553.76 --> 5560.159000000001
yeah that it's worth it like you can't

5558.159 --> 5561.36
you can't go there with people if you

5560.159 --> 5564.5599999999995
see it

5561.36 --> 5565.679
you can't do that and if they break up

5564.56 --> 5568.639
with you then

5565.679 --> 5569.36
yeah i would kind of like say it was

5568.639 --> 5572.84
meant to be

5569.36 --> 5575.839999999999
but still man it sucks sorry to hear

5572.84 --> 5575.84
that

5577.12 --> 5579.44
right

5581.679 --> 5585.1990000000005
does she also know you're into flat

5584.639 --> 5586.96
earth

5585.199 --> 5589.199
because that would be almost like even

5586.96 --> 5589.76
more ironic that she wouldn't break up

5589.199 --> 5591.919999999999
with you

5589.76 --> 5596.0
over flat earth but then the vaccine

5591.92 --> 5596.0
corona [ __ ] happens and then she did

5600.84 --> 5603.84
that's

5604.96 --> 5608.32
i ran 26.

5608.88 --> 5612.8
that's terrible and funny at the same

5614.84 --> 5617.84
time

5782.8 --> 5786.400000000001
i'm doing okay i'm doing i'm doing good

5785.679 --> 5789.679
i guess

5786.4 --> 5792.96
it's just that i have a bit of a wrath

5789.679 --> 5793.679
issue right i'm trying to deal with it

5792.96 --> 5798.2390000000005
it's like

5793.679 --> 5800.8
i guess the latest chapter in

5798.239 --> 5802.159
arwenian development is just like i'm

5800.8 --> 5805.119000000001
reflecting a lot upon

5802.159 --> 5805.599999999999
wrath because it's just like all the

5805.119 --> 5807.679
evil

5805.6 --> 5810.719
is staring in my face even from the

5807.679 --> 5813.28
other side in the other dimension

5810.719 --> 5814.719
and it's like i'm just losing my

5813.28 --> 5817.5199999999995
patience with it

5814.719 --> 5817.52
so bad

5819.119 --> 5822.639
it's like i can't step away and just

5821.36 --> 5825.119
like oh wow

5822.639 --> 5827.04
look look at how freaking beautiful this

5825.119 --> 5828.88
is look

5827.04 --> 5831.04
look at the sun look at the beautiful

5828.88 --> 5832.56
clouds i'm so lucky i live in a country

5831.04 --> 5833.6
where we just have these beautiful

5832.56 --> 5837.76
clouds

5833.6 --> 5838.639
so many times and it's spring and the

5837.76 --> 5842.96
birds are

5838.639 --> 5842.96
crushing it out there building nests and

5849.76 --> 5855.4400000000005
right so you can get away from it but

5852.48 --> 5858.638999999999
then as soon as you

5855.44 --> 5861.5199999999995
see some kind of a newspaper or see

5858.639 --> 5868.2390000000005
some television on somewhere it's like

5861.52 --> 5871.84
immediately you get like the demons

5868.239 --> 5874.799999999999
oh you have to wear two masks

5871.84 --> 5875.28
like immediately that [ __ ] just hits you

5874.8 --> 5883.84
right

5875.28 --> 5883.84
it's so shocking

5894.84 --> 5901.359
laughs

5896.71 --> 5901.359
[Music]

5904.4 --> 5910.4
and it's like also the the story micro

5907.679 --> 5912.639
management you know of these stupid

5910.4 --> 5917.04
measures the constant

5912.639 --> 5920.08
most political level whining

5917.04 --> 5922.8
meaning about the details

5920.08 --> 5924.0
like oh maybe we should wear two masks

5922.8 --> 5927.04
and then it's like

5924.0 --> 5929.6
now it's an item where suddenly people

5927.04 --> 5930.239
feel that it's really useful to freaking

5929.6 --> 5932.88
discuss

5930.239 --> 5933.678999999999
whether two masks are useful or not and

5932.88 --> 5936.56
people will

5933.679 --> 5939.52
[ __ ] defend it literally not knowing

5936.56 --> 5943.679
what the hell they're talking about

5939.52 --> 5945.280000000001
that [ __ ] like

5943.679 --> 5946.96
it's like every time you can just say

5945.28 --> 5948.639
this is all lies it's

5946.96 --> 5950.96
[ __ ] [ __ ] you can literally in

5948.639 --> 5954.4800000000005
one sense ramble it up

5950.96 --> 5955.84
it's all 100 lies but no people get

5954.48 --> 5958.638999999999
stuck up but

5955.84 --> 5960.88
but they're discussing about whether two

5958.639 --> 5962.719
masks are better than one

5960.88 --> 5967.84
why are they discussing it then if it's

5962.719 --> 5967.84
all lies it can't be lies

5968.56 --> 5974.88
trump vaccine for everyone oh god

5971.84 --> 5978.719
don't remind me about that so

5974.88 --> 5978.719
so messed up man like

5979.36 --> 5981.839999999999
ugh

5982.48 --> 5991.678999999999
like like

5986.159 --> 5991.679
trump in that sense like literally just

5992.56 --> 5995.84
like slipped over the edge with that

5995.04 --> 5998.639
[ __ ]

5995.84 --> 5998.639
so terrible

6002.0 --> 6005.92
yes amanda if everything's all right

6004.08 --> 6008.239
nathan's gonna have a live show in about

6005.92 --> 6011.1990000000005
12 minutes

6008.239 --> 6014.0

6011.199 --> 6014.0
having a show

6019.119 --> 6023.839999999999
although i don't see any link yet

6027.04 --> 6036.4
what's this maybe he's just late

6030.48 --> 6039.599999999999
oh wait ah yeah he just posted uh this

6036.4 --> 6043.28
the uh back panel link lit so he's

6039.6 --> 6043.280000000001
probably just late he got busy

6048.32 --> 6053.44
so the the pre-show started late as it

6051.199 --> 6053.44
were

6055.52 --> 6065.84
hey mark collard good to see you man

6058.32 --> 6065.84
long time no see

6078.08 --> 6083.5199999999995
right yeah geoshifter oh man the 50 50

6081.199 --> 6083.5199999999995
thing

6084.0 --> 6090.88
but it's i i really wonder sometimes

6087.119 --> 6091.92
if like are these the skepticals that no

6090.88 --> 6094.0
know

6091.92 --> 6096.08
some that things are wrong and that are

6094.0 --> 6098.08
working on it but that just like can't

6096.08 --> 6101.199
handle flat earth and any of that

6098.08 --> 6101.92
like are they hearing me are there

6101.199 --> 6105.04
people like

6101.92 --> 6107.119
watching me and watch what i say like in

6105.04 --> 6109.5199999999995
real in reflection upon

6107.119 --> 6110.88
what's happening out there because i'm

6109.52 --> 6114.56
taking such an

6110.88 --> 6115.6
well an advanced angle to things where i

6114.56 --> 6119.52
basically say

6115.6 --> 6122.320000000001
no oh you're still figuring it out

6119.52 --> 6123.119000000001
what's a lie about this right well let

6122.32 --> 6126.48
me just

6123.119 --> 6126.48
lay it down

6126.639 --> 6133.119
big [ __ ] book like yeah

6130.4 --> 6134.239
all viruses are [ __ ] lies there's no

6133.119 --> 6136.88
proof they exist

6134.239 --> 6140.159
scientifically it's exosomes it's body

6136.88 --> 6144.400000000001
inherent defense mechanisms non-living

6140.159 --> 6146.32
things yeah

6144.4 --> 6148.4
and we've been scammed for like a

6146.32 --> 6149.36
hundred years by the medical industrial

6148.4 --> 6151.5199999999995
complex that have

6149.36 --> 6152.88
grown completely out of control and have

6151.52 --> 6155.6
taken kind of like

6152.88 --> 6157.28
rout yeah rooted themselves into

6155.6 --> 6159.84
corporate

6157.28 --> 6161.599999999999
mega corporation world and governments

6159.84 --> 6164.2390000000005
and that's where we are now and

6161.6 --> 6166.639
while we're trying to find out whether

6164.239 --> 6168.959999999999
the response to the virus

6166.639 --> 6170.2390000000005
or what is the why is it it doesn't

6168.96 --> 6173.6
[ __ ] exist

6170.239 --> 6174.638999999999
nothing about it is real not a single

6173.6 --> 6178.400000000001
thing

6174.639 --> 6182.56
there was no origin point for the virus

6178.4 --> 6186.0
there is no virus there is

6182.56 --> 6190.719
no viruses right not just

6186.0 --> 6194.56
no covet no there is no virus viruses

6190.719 --> 6197.6
are not infectious we've been completely

6194.56 --> 6200.159000000001
from scratch lied to for like

6197.6 --> 6203.119000000001
multiple generations it's one of the

6200.159 --> 6205.119
heaviest weighing scams

6203.119 --> 6207.759999999999
humanity is suffering under and it's

6205.119 --> 6208.839999999999
reaching its crescendo it's reaching its

6207.76 --> 6211.76
eugenics

6208.84 --> 6212.56
extermination point where we are being

6211.76 --> 6215.84
driven

6212.56 --> 6217.280000000001
crammed into that tight tight row into

6215.84 --> 6219.92
the slaughterhouse

6217.28 --> 6221.84
and that's where we're at right now and

6219.92 --> 6223.76
i'm wondering sometimes if people on the

6221.84 --> 6226.639
sidelines

6223.76 --> 6227.119000000001
i don't know that have to pay attention

6226.639 --> 6229.36
or

6227.119 --> 6231.119
keep track of my activities for whatever

6229.36 --> 6232.48
reason who knows

6231.119 --> 6234.719
they're just looking at it and it's like

6232.48 --> 6236.959999999999
oh [ __ ]

6234.719 --> 6236.96
this

6238.0 --> 6241.76
is that why i'm never really being taken

6240.48 --> 6245.44
down because i

6241.76 --> 6250.320000000001
might be just absolutely right about

6245.44 --> 6253.119
everything about this is that why

6250.32 --> 6255.44
so they're kind of like oh [ __ ] this

6253.119 --> 6257.199
arwin channel out here is like a bunch

6255.44 --> 6259.44
of hot coals

6257.199 --> 6260.719
it's like yeah it shines light on

6259.44 --> 6263.199
everything but it's

6260.719 --> 6264.4
too hot to handle so just let's just

6263.199 --> 6267.5199999999995
keep juggling it

6264.4 --> 6269.599999999999
up there in the air keep it away from

6267.52 --> 6270.639
that hand as much as possible but we

6269.6 --> 6274.56
kind of need this

6270.639 --> 6279.84
light because he's right

6274.56 --> 6279.84
i wonder if that is it or maybe i'm just

6279.92 --> 6285.679
yeah overestimating my influence

6283.76 --> 6287.360000000001
i don't know maybe i'm just a canary in

6285.679 --> 6288.96
the coal mine i'm just picking up on

6287.36 --> 6290.96
frequencies and i'm kind of like a

6288.96 --> 6292.88
secondary afterthought because there's

6290.96 --> 6295.199
people that are

6292.88 --> 6296.0
potentially wielding this a lot better

6295.199 --> 6300.5599999999995
and

6296.0 --> 6300.56
getting more practical strategics

6300.84 --> 6306.4400000000005
involved because they have

6304.08 --> 6309.76
more extensive lives and more

6306.44 --> 6311.36
investments and ties into society and

6309.76 --> 6314.08
other people

6311.36 --> 6314.799999999999
that they also need to help defend

6314.08 --> 6318.159
against

6314.8 --> 6318.639
it while i am in a relatively hermit

6318.159 --> 6321.36
like

6318.639 --> 6322.4800000000005
isolated position don't have those ties

6321.36 --> 6324.799999999999
so for me

6322.48 --> 6326.32
the canary in the coal mine effect the

6324.8 --> 6329.4400000000005
gazing into the deep

6326.32 --> 6332.88
into the future into the structure is

6329.44 --> 6332.879999999999
more pure and more

6332.92 --> 6339.1990000000005
unstrategical because i don't

6336.159 --> 6340.96
have a specific thing

6339.199 --> 6343.199
except for flat earth but yeah flat

6340.96 --> 6346.88
earth is pretty dynamic and

6343.199 --> 6349.44
well it would make the

6346.88 --> 6350.0
have to make some effort to really mess

6349.44 --> 6353.04
up

6350.0 --> 6353.04
compared to others

6356.84 --> 6361.6
but

6358.159 --> 6361.599999999999
now i'm losing my train of thought

6365.44 --> 6387.2
that just completely broke off

6372.4 --> 6388.4
shouldn't have sidetracked so much

6387.2 --> 6391.679
[Music]

6388.4 --> 6401.839999999999
jesus that's

6391.679 --> 6401.84
that's sick

6403.28 --> 6415.599999999999
that's really sad man mark collard

6406.8 --> 6419.04
but wasn't she warned about that like

6415.6 --> 6422.4800000000005
isn't that just widely known like

6419.04 --> 6423.6
with every form of vaccine like even the

6422.48 --> 6426.08
ones that are even

6423.6 --> 6428.08
sort of legitimate vaccines like isn't

6426.08 --> 6430.639
that just widely known you don't

6428.08 --> 6431.679
vaccine a pregnant woman under any

6430.639 --> 6443.84
condition

6431.679 --> 6443.84
any condition like

6446.56 --> 6450.080000000001
why did she do it then

6454.08 --> 6459.119
can i post a link to eric dubay vaccine

6457.28 --> 6462.88
reaction video

6459.119 --> 6464.88
uh sure ironf26

6462.88 --> 6467.1990000000005
i didn't know he had a vaccine reaction

6464.88 --> 6467.1990000000005
video

6468.4 --> 6471.839999999999
what is it like

6477.52 --> 6499.84
oh my god oh please stop mark

6482.4 --> 6499.839999999999
dear come on god

6509.71 --> 6512.869
[Music]

6528.88 --> 6532.2390000000005
okay so yeah

6532.88 --> 6538.4800000000005
he has just a lot of like the

6536.32 --> 6539.759999999999
footage of people getting [ __ ] up by

6538.48 --> 6543.119
the vaccine

6539.76 --> 6545.679
yet i i can't handle that [ __ ]

6543.119 --> 6547.759999999999
right i get to see some of it through

6545.679 --> 6551.4400000000005
infowars

6547.76 --> 6552.96
it's so messed up but what's even more

6551.44 --> 6556.638999999999
messed up is that people

6552.96 --> 6559.199
can actually ignore it like

6556.639 --> 6559.679
what the hell people like general people

6559.199 --> 6562.799999999999
out there

6559.679 --> 6565.36
you think that in your mind it's

6562.8 --> 6566.639
okay to pretend like that might have

6565.36 --> 6569.5599999999995
been acted

6566.639 --> 6572.08
like oh there is somebody out there is a

6569.56 --> 6573.84
conspiracy to discourage you to take the

6572.08 --> 6576.32
vaccine

6573.84 --> 6576.32
really

6577.28 --> 6582.5599999999995
you think that you allow yourself to

6580.88 --> 6584.88
think that and you think you can get

6582.56 --> 6588.400000000001
away with it without some

6584.88 --> 6590.639
like serious consequence

6588.4 --> 6593.199
consequences for you personally that

6590.639 --> 6597.4400000000005
nobody will ever know and nobody would

6593.199 --> 6601.36
act it's because you

6597.44 --> 6604.638999999999
you have literally caught you've cons

6601.36 --> 6607.759999999999
you've conspiracy theorized something

6604.639 --> 6611.04
that you couldn't deal with

6607.76 --> 6614.4800000000005
and in it just ignore like massive

6611.04 --> 6615.199
suffering ignore massive suffering and

6614.48 --> 6619.04
saying it's

6615.199 --> 6619.919999999999
acted right i find that comparable to

6619.04 --> 6623.04
like

6619.92 --> 6625.04
oh look the iraq war

6623.04 --> 6626.239
look at all these blown-up places and

6625.04 --> 6629.36
then just say

6626.239 --> 6631.36
no it's fake man that's that's just a

6629.36 --> 6633.04
that's just the stage like those are

6631.36 --> 6636.48
props that's not really a

6633.04 --> 6639.599
that blown up person right

6636.48 --> 6641.5199999999995
that's what that would be like to me if

6639.599 --> 6645.1990000000005
people actually in their mind would

6641.52 --> 6646.400000000001
just justify like ignoring all those

6645.199 --> 6649.919999999999
types of videos

6646.4 --> 6653.36
because oh it's fake

6649.92 --> 6655.599
or no it can't be real

6653.36 --> 6657.839999999999
that's that level it's it's literally

6655.599 --> 6657.84
like

6660.639 --> 6664.08
okay didn't think i was gonna go there

6662.8 --> 6666.159000000001
at the end of the show but

6664.08 --> 6668.4

6666.159 --> 6672.96
of holocaust denial

6668.4 --> 6676.0
huh funny how that circles back

6672.96 --> 6676.2390000000005
circles way back to the beginning where

6676.0 --> 6679.679
i

6676.239 --> 6683.199
started to say like yeah hello people

6679.679 --> 6685.4400000000005

6683.199 --> 6687.839999999999

6685.44 --> 6690.879999999999
