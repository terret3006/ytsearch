101.2 --> 104.56
in the recent times

107.28 --> 112.68
anyway

109.119 --> 112.68
the weather today

114.24 --> 116.64
is

117.119 --> 123.759
still kind of clouded

119.84 --> 126.159
oh and there are my cam freezes

123.759 --> 129.84
that's a good point to freeze on though

126.159 --> 129.84
pretty beautiful picture

133.68 --> 137.44
there's some blue in between there

140.08 --> 146.239
but yeah most of it is just

143.68 --> 148.48000000000002
kind of cloudy

146.239 --> 150.64000000000001
one big difference is there is there

148.48 --> 152.319
doesn't seem to be a lot of wind here

150.64 --> 156.44
oh look at that

152.319 --> 156.44
jack dog taking a bath

157.12 --> 161.16
oh he's enjoying that

186.72 --> 192.48
i'm sorry i just

188.319 --> 192.48
i tend to really enjoy looking at that

197.28 --> 201.28
it's part of the reason i put that there

201.68 --> 205.92000000000002
and of course so they have something to

203.36 --> 205.92000000000002
drink but

210.84 --> 214.239
yeah right

223.04 --> 231.35999999999999
the best pick hello first in chat

227.44 --> 231.35999999999999
haven't seen you around here before

232.0 --> 235.84
welcome to the flat earth early word

233.84 --> 241.48
show

235.84 --> 241.48
it is sunday the 1st of may 2022.

252.64 --> 255.83999999999997
got some gusto

263.84 --> 267.15999999999997
green tea

269.04 --> 274.56
yeah and i don't really have a specific

271.12 --> 274.56
subject to talk about today

277.6 --> 282.24
yesterday show was

279.36 --> 284.88
pretty intense

282.24 --> 284.88
in ways

284.96 --> 289.19899999999996
fractal thinking

287.12 --> 292.0
all that

289.199 --> 293.52000000000004
hello aaron armstrong gusto yeah it's

292.0 --> 294.4
the name of the brand is what it's

293.52 --> 296.88
called

294.4 --> 300.44
right gusto

296.88 --> 300.44
that's what it's called

310.32 --> 315.56
hey turret 306. good to see you

324.11 --> 329.199
[Music]

327.039 --> 334.759
like a soda

329.199 --> 334.759
well it's like a non-sugary energy drink

338.479 --> 343.919
i mean it's not yeah it's not like cola

341.84 --> 346.4
but it does does i think there is some

343.919 --> 349.19899999999996
cola nut type of taste in there

346.4 --> 351.12
but it's mostly just every conceivable

349.199 --> 355.52000000000004
form of ginseng

351.12 --> 355.52
in the world is all in here

356.639 --> 362.919
and yeah i just like it sometimes it's

359.36 --> 362.91900000000004
it's really good

367.919 --> 373.039
right you can look it up i mean i showed

370.08 --> 373.039
it on screen

374.08 --> 378.90999999999997
you you can look up the product and

377.12 --> 384.66
the ingredients

378.91 --> 384.66
[Music]

386.88 --> 390.199
let's see

403.52 --> 406.96
i think yeah this is produced in england

405.759 --> 409.84000000000003
apparently

406.96 --> 409.84
great britain

414.479 --> 419.12
or at least they seem to be involved in

416.479 --> 420.479
the production chain or whatever

419.12 --> 424.08
i don't know

420.479 --> 424.08
but i really like that drink

424.56 --> 429.319
established since 1990

429.52 --> 431.75899999999996
so

432.56 --> 438.479
like it's literally on the cover

435.199 --> 440.40000000000003
it's pretty new i guess

438.479 --> 443.36
anyway

440.4 --> 447.19899999999996
right so yeah i've been watching

443.36 --> 450.40000000000003
kind of finishing watching own benjamin

447.199 --> 453.36
from still from friday and all that

450.4 --> 456.15999999999997
and yeah it's more about rockfin saga

453.36 --> 458.319
about just what's going on

456.16 --> 460.639
how to figure it out i really like the

458.319 --> 462.40000000000003
way like the level home benjamin's on

460.639 --> 464.72
these days

462.4 --> 467.35999999999996
it is fractal thinking

464.72 --> 470.40000000000003
what he's doing and he's like

467.36 --> 472.16
like really putting it to use and like i

470.4 --> 474.23999999999995
absolutely

472.16 --> 476.16
respect that and i'm quite in awe of

474.24 --> 477.84000000000003
that

476.16 --> 481.03900000000004
i try to do

477.84 --> 482.31899999999996
something similar with my own focus

481.039 --> 484.24
right

482.319 --> 485.599
i hope that's coming across

484.24 --> 487.599
i mean

485.599 --> 489.199
i don't necessarily even know like how

487.599 --> 490.84
much

489.199 --> 493.36
is really coming

490.84 --> 495.35999999999996
across at times

493.36 --> 497.199
i just know that when i see it back i

495.36 --> 499.199
understand exactly what i'm talking

497.199 --> 501.36
about

499.199 --> 503.28000000000003
and

501.36 --> 507.039
it makes sense to me

503.28 --> 511.44
but i don't know if other people will

507.039 --> 511.44
necessarily have that to the same degree

513.2 --> 517.6800000000001
and that's why i'm very interested in

515.039 --> 517.68
like okay

518.64 --> 523.36
like store some of these episodes that

520.959 --> 525.5189999999999
are like really baffling or even things

523.36 --> 528.32
that are off-putting about it

525.519 --> 530.48
save it somewhere like on a dvd or

528.32 --> 532.72
something so that they can't just

530.48 --> 536.24
suddenly be deleted out of nowhere and

532.72 --> 538.399
then watch it back in 10 years

536.24 --> 541.2
it yeah

538.399 --> 542.88
and just see like see what you can see

541.2 --> 544.88
in it then

542.88 --> 547.279
and of course it's gonna like feed you

544.88 --> 549.2
back to this time

547.279 --> 550.88
and things you were struggling with at

549.2 --> 553.44
this time

550.88 --> 556.08
right so it's different for you now but

553.44 --> 557.12
in the future

556.08 --> 559.0400000000001
you know

557.12 --> 560.8
you might suddenly get a whole bunch of

559.04 --> 563.1999999999999
clarity

560.8 --> 564.959
right i even talk about it like with my

563.2 --> 567.36
own experiences like how things that i

564.959 --> 570.0799999999999
experienced like 20 years ago

567.36 --> 572.0
were super impressive but i didn't have

570.08 --> 574.72
the grip to really

572.0 --> 577.36
figure out what to do with it

574.72 --> 579.279
how to build with it and now like so

577.36 --> 582.0
much later

579.279 --> 584.56
still holding on to actually wanting to

582.0 --> 586.56
do that not giving up on that um unlike

584.56 --> 588.56
really getting a grip

586.56 --> 591.4399999999999
i can see so much more and i can even

588.56 --> 593.3599999999999
dig back into memories of the past and

591.44 --> 595.2
even what it was like

593.36 --> 597.839
the feelings of it

595.2 --> 599.12
like really look back and re-experience

597.839 --> 601.519
it

599.12 --> 603.279
well you could potentially do that too

601.519 --> 605.92
record

603.279 --> 608.72
one of these episodes

605.92 --> 611.519
separate from the internet

608.72 --> 614.0
beyond just digital just on a dvd like

611.519 --> 615.519
some physical storage or a usb stick

614.0 --> 618.72
whatever right

615.519 --> 621.04
and make sure you don't lose it and

618.72 --> 623.6800000000001
you could put other stuff on there it's

621.04 --> 625.36
remember that cute thing what is called

623.68 --> 628.8
a

625.36 --> 631.12
time capsule remember that

628.8 --> 633.68
so 20th century before the really

631.12 --> 636.32
digitization of everything put something

633.68 --> 638.88
in the box and then 50 years later

636.32 --> 642.399
see what everybody put there

638.88 --> 644.0
right well you can do that very easy now

642.399 --> 645.68
all you have to do is just take

644.0 --> 647.36
something a video

645.68 --> 649.519
and keep it

647.36 --> 651.519
don't delete it as soon as you feel like

649.519 --> 653.76
this might be outdated

651.519 --> 656.48
right just really store it and save it

653.76 --> 658.48
for later and

656.48 --> 661.519
who knows what you'll see in it i still

658.48 --> 663.9200000000001
have pictures on my computer that i put

661.519 --> 666.079
there 20 years ago

663.92 --> 668.4799999999999
and now i look back and it's like every

666.079 --> 670.959
time it's like i'm just

668.48 --> 670.9590000000001
putting it

671.12 --> 675.04
opening a door

672.56 --> 677.8389999999999
to literally the past

675.04 --> 679.76
like i can step back into what i was

677.839 --> 681.0400000000001
back then

679.76 --> 683.6
just by

681.04 --> 684.959
seeing those things that were left there

683.6 --> 687.279
right this is

684.959 --> 689.1199999999999
part of the reason why i tend to like

687.279 --> 691.6
hold on to stuff

689.12 --> 693.839
because for my spirit it becomes so much

691.6 --> 695.839
more valuable over time a lot of these

693.839 --> 696.8000000000001
things and a lot of things turn out to

695.839 --> 698.5600000000001
be like

696.8 --> 700.7199999999999
yeah that actually kind of was a waste

698.56 --> 702.88
of time to keep that around and then

700.72 --> 705.12
i'll throw it away but i wait very long

702.88 --> 707.519
until i have the clarity to actually see

705.12 --> 709.839
the difference

707.519 --> 709.839
right

713.6 --> 717.44
so yeah you could do that too even if

715.44 --> 720.0
you think like yeah i think this arwen

717.44 --> 722.1600000000001
guy yeah yeah is interesting but i

720.0 --> 724.88
disagree with everything right

722.16 --> 726.16
save an episode

724.88 --> 728.16
especially

726.16 --> 730.8
especially like the ones where i talk

728.16 --> 731.6
spirit mechanics save it

730.8 --> 734.4799999999999
and

731.6 --> 737.0400000000001
store it somewhere

734.48 --> 739.519
take it with you i don't know man

737.04 --> 741.92
sew a usb stick with it like in your

739.519 --> 744.399
favorite jacket that you expect to last

741.92 --> 747.279
at least 10 years

744.399 --> 749.44
and then watch it back in 10 years

747.279 --> 752.0
right like this channel might not be

749.44 --> 754.24
youtube might be gone

752.0 --> 756.16
suddenly or whatever right we don't know

754.24 --> 757.279
what could happen if you put it on a

756.16 --> 759.4399999999999
stick

757.279 --> 761.68
then you have something to reflect on

759.44 --> 764.48
later

761.68 --> 766.0
you have the feeling that i the the

764.48 --> 768.24
control and the feeling and the

766.0 --> 771.839
smoothness of what i have now the

768.24 --> 774.16
oversight of this moment for me in this

771.839 --> 774.1600000000001
frame

774.959 --> 778.88
and you might be in a better position

777.519 --> 782.5600000000001
then

778.88 --> 785.36
be closer to what i actually am

782.56 --> 787.279
to fully get a grasp certainly on the

785.36 --> 790.8000000000001
things that i'm doing and the

787.279 --> 793.04
information that i'm sharing

790.8 --> 793.04
right

793.12 --> 800.079
i am like a living time capsule

795.76 --> 802.48
potentially if you want it to be

800.079 --> 802.4799999999999
anyway

803.2 --> 805.6800000000001
right

804.16 --> 809.8389999999999
hey elise g

805.68 --> 809.8389999999999
iron 26 haven't seen you in a while

812.56 --> 817.5999999999999
like reading your chats from 10 plus

814.959 --> 817.5999999999999
years ago

823.12 --> 826.16
right and the funny thing is there with

824.72 --> 830.5600000000001
306

826.16 --> 833.279
i have chats from like

830.56 --> 836.279
more than 10 years ago was it

833.279 --> 836.279
2005

837.839 --> 844.1600000000001
2006.

840.48 --> 844.16
i had like over

844.32 --> 849.44
was it

846.48 --> 851.44
msn messenger it was the name if i

849.44 --> 853.7600000000001
remember correctly and it might still be

851.44 --> 855.6
around i'm not sure

853.76 --> 857.92
and i had like this very elaborate

855.6 --> 859.44
communication with somebody that was

857.92 --> 861.199
basically

859.44 --> 864.0
being a medium

861.199 --> 866.88
and it was very spectacular to me like i

864.0 --> 870.959
was so zoned in it was incredible and

866.88 --> 873.76
like the person was like

870.959 --> 873.76
like really

874.48 --> 881.12
translating an advanced intelligence

878.48 --> 883.76
like and it might have been literally a

881.12 --> 884.72
part of her but she wasn't able to say

883.76 --> 887.12
her

884.72 --> 889.36
she wasn't able to basically integrate

887.12 --> 891.12
that level of intelligence just with her

889.36 --> 892.399
person normally because nobody would

891.12 --> 896.079
accept it

892.399 --> 897.279
she was like a very smart person that

896.079 --> 899.199
was

897.279 --> 901.76
unable to really

899.199 --> 904.24
take a stand for it

901.76 --> 906.639
so that's what i think in retrospect and

904.24 --> 908.8
she was channeling

906.639 --> 910.839
this higher

908.8 --> 913.199
priority

910.839 --> 915.7600000000001
intelligence and

913.199 --> 917.519
yeah and we had just these giant

915.76 --> 919.76
conversations where i asked questions

917.519 --> 922.24
right i asked people here in chat always

919.76 --> 925.4399999999999
ask me questions ask me questions yeah

922.24 --> 927.839
well just imagine me talking what is it

925.44 --> 927.839
for like

928.079 --> 934.16
20 hours over chat with a person and

931.199 --> 937.519
pretty much half of the time

934.16 --> 938.88
constantly asking questions more more

937.519 --> 941.36
what about this structure what about

938.88 --> 942.16
that stroke like what about the pantheon

941.36 --> 944.639
like

942.16 --> 947.04
are there like separate

944.639 --> 949.36
intelligent entities that are attained

947.04 --> 950.3199999999999
that are effectively like pantheonic

949.36 --> 951.92
gods

950.32 --> 955.519
or do they think they are like how does

951.92 --> 957.04
this all work like like what about

955.519 --> 958.639
christ god

957.04 --> 961.12
and how does like how does the

958.639 --> 961.12
interaction

962.399 --> 967.199
everything everything i can think of

964.48 --> 971.1990000000001
everything i could think of i threw at

967.199 --> 974.079
it and it tried to answer every time

971.199 --> 975.92
and sometimes it seemed like it just was

974.079 --> 978.3199999999999
getting flustered

975.92 --> 981.5999999999999
it was weird because at first it seemed

978.32 --> 984.0790000000001
to like identify as like i'm a

981.6 --> 987.9200000000001
newborn god like a young spirit and it

984.079 --> 989.76
seemed very young what what she was

987.92 --> 991.36
channeling

989.76 --> 993.6
[Music]

991.36 --> 995.6800000000001
like i was identifying the spirits it

993.6 --> 997.839
was high brilliance but like with a

995.68 --> 1000.0
mindset of a five-year-old

997.839 --> 1001.839
did like very sensitive not very

1000.0 --> 1002.72
developed

1001.839 --> 1005.2790000000001
in

1002.72 --> 1007.759
dealing with feelings

1005.279 --> 1010.8
but like really high mechanical

1007.759 --> 1012.0
intelligence into the spirit

1010.8 --> 1015.519
right

1012.0 --> 1017.04
and yeah i still have those cats i still

1015.519 --> 1019.04
haven't

1017.04 --> 1020.88
i haven't looked at it for a long time

1019.04 --> 1024.0
also because

1020.88 --> 1025.679
it's kind of off-putting to me why

1024.0 --> 1026.64
because the way

1025.679 --> 1030.5590000000002
i

1026.64 --> 1032.88
i used my own vernacular and my inquiry

1030.559 --> 1037.28
was really underdeveloped compared to

1032.88 --> 1041.3600000000001
now so to me it's like it's embarrassing

1037.28 --> 1043.6
but i did the best i could with it

1041.36 --> 1045.9189999999999
and i got try to get everything out of

1043.6 --> 1048.3999999999999
it i could

1045.919 --> 1052.4
right those experience by the way were

1048.4 --> 1053.5590000000002
also part of what fueled me

1052.4 --> 1055.3600000000001
to make my

1053.559 --> 1057.2
symbolics.nlsight

1055.36 --> 1059.84
because it pretty much happened right

1057.2 --> 1059.8400000000001
before that

1061.12 --> 1065.28
i'm not even sure if i mentioned like it

1064.08 --> 1068.48
by name

1065.28 --> 1072.36
on symbolics.now

1068.48 --> 1072.3600000000001
is the name that was attributed

1074.56 --> 1077.69
[Music]

1084.48 --> 1087.679
and i have like a

1085.84 --> 1090.32
picture of it

1087.679 --> 1092.3200000000002
dude i had a

1090.32 --> 1095.4399999999998
we called

1092.32 --> 1096.799
glass inlet window made with that

1095.44 --> 1098.48
picture even

1096.799 --> 1101.679
so it was very

1098.48 --> 1104.48
intense and inspiring

1101.679 --> 1107.1200000000001
but i was always like very careful to

1104.48 --> 1108.64
truly like oh i'm going to recognize

1107.12 --> 1111.039
this as a deity because there was

1108.64 --> 1114.0
something weird about it also

1111.039 --> 1116.0
during the whole process

1114.0 --> 1118.08
the spirit changed

1116.0 --> 1120.559
it changed from

1118.08 --> 1122.799
basically the focused high mechanical

1120.559 --> 1125.6
intelligence and the sensitivity

1122.799 --> 1128.8799999999999
it seemed like she as a medium she's the

1125.6 --> 1130.24
first time she had this kind of intense

1128.88 --> 1132.24
channeling

1130.24 --> 1134.64
and i had the suspicion that at some

1132.24 --> 1136.96
point because i tried to test her i

1134.64 --> 1139.2
tried to test whether she was conscious

1136.96 --> 1140.799
of what i was talking about and i

1139.2 --> 1143.3600000000001
actually

1140.799 --> 1145.679
to see if she was actually tricking me

1143.36 --> 1149.28
if she was playing me or whether it was

1145.679 --> 1151.52
a genuine channel and i like tricked her

1149.28 --> 1153.84
is it's kind of bad in retrospect it's

1151.52 --> 1158.48
not a nice thing that i did that but i

1153.84 --> 1161.76
conspired behind her back to her face

1158.48 --> 1163.52
with the other entity

1161.76 --> 1165.919
and when i did that

1163.52 --> 1166.799
she didn't seem to be conscious about it

1165.919 --> 1168.7990000000002
or

1166.799 --> 1170.72
she was still upholding the act and

1168.799 --> 1172.08
noticed that i was trying to [ __ ] with

1170.72 --> 1174.0
her and then

1172.08 --> 1176.08
whatever happened it changed after that

1174.0 --> 1178.799
point because then still had some

1176.08 --> 1181.12
interactions but it like turned more

1178.799 --> 1183.76
grim and into a grabber like the very

1181.12 --> 1185.9189999999999
nature of what it was doing and what it

1183.76 --> 1189.84
could do changed

1185.919 --> 1189.8400000000001
so i kind of ruined it in a way

1190.32 --> 1195.52
but i got so much out of that experience

1198.08 --> 1201.76
right

1199.039 --> 1203.52
what i mean it's like she didn't seem to

1201.76 --> 1204.48
be conscious about

1203.52 --> 1206.4
what

1204.48 --> 1208.159
it was talking about

1206.4 --> 1210.24
through her

1208.159 --> 1212.3200000000002
like she was turned off like she

1210.24 --> 1215.2
wouldn't remember afterwards and i had

1212.32 --> 1217.36
like i i just had to do it she's trying

1215.2 --> 1220.8400000000001
to test it i had to see if that was

1217.36 --> 1220.84
actually real

1220.96 --> 1225.28
right

1222.96 --> 1226.159
and

1225.28 --> 1229.039
yeah

1226.159 --> 1230.0800000000002
i'm pretty sure that did ruin it

1229.039 --> 1231.52
though

1230.08 --> 1234.32
but

1231.52 --> 1236.32
in a way like it wasn't really going

1234.32 --> 1238.3999999999999
anywhere

1236.32 --> 1240.6399999999999
all i would have ever been able to get

1238.4 --> 1242.64
out of it was all that information and

1240.64 --> 1244.5590000000002
just seeing what that is what that

1242.64 --> 1246.7990000000002
channeling is what

1244.559 --> 1249.12
like as a psychological process like

1246.799 --> 1252.24
what's actually happening

1249.12 --> 1252.2399999999998
when she was doing that

1254.48 --> 1256.799
anyway

1258.88 --> 1263.6000000000001
so that's some of my experiences

1262.0 --> 1266.559
right

1263.6 --> 1268.9599999999998
and it's just dude if you really have a

1266.559 --> 1271.52
grasp on everything you've done in the

1268.96 --> 1273.3600000000001
past and not just try to erase it

1271.52 --> 1275.039
because you're embarrassed or oh you're

1273.36 --> 1276.7199999999998
so much better now

1275.039 --> 1278.559
if you realize that you're constantly

1276.72 --> 1280.32
bumping into things in your life that

1278.559 --> 1281.6
you don't know how to deal with but you

1280.32 --> 1284.24
will

1281.6 --> 1286.6399999999999
record it

1284.24 --> 1289.6
within yourself

1286.64 --> 1293.039
and then eventually looking back becomes

1289.6 --> 1295.52
so valuable you have all this thing all

1293.039 --> 1297.6
these things you experience that you can

1295.52 --> 1299.52
learn from you don't have to just focus

1297.6 --> 1301.6789999999999
on how weak you were

1299.52 --> 1304.4
in the past

1301.679 --> 1305.6000000000001
you can focus out of what you actually

1304.4 --> 1307.3600000000001
got

1305.6 --> 1310.0
and what you can do with it even

1307.36 --> 1310.0
afterward

1310.559 --> 1315.44
and you can tap a lot of strength and

1312.72 --> 1317.84
determination and confidence in doing

1315.44 --> 1321.2
that and that's why it's so important to

1317.84 --> 1323.12
hold on to your full memory

1321.2 --> 1325.52
and not

1323.12 --> 1328.7199999999998
tap into double think

1325.52 --> 1331.52
because that causes dementia

1328.72 --> 1333.44
you lose track guess what's to happen

1331.52 --> 1335.28
when you lose track when it becomes

1333.44 --> 1338.3200000000002
dangerous to look back

1335.28 --> 1341.039
you lose those pillars

1338.32 --> 1344.24
those important moments in your memory

1341.039 --> 1348.24
in your past that you can use to tap

1344.24 --> 1351.039
strength from you lose that see see how

1348.24 --> 1355.2
the spirit mechanics how it all fits it

1351.039 --> 1356.48
fits perfectly like a well-oiled machine

1355.2 --> 1358.559
of

1356.48 --> 1361.919
consequences

1358.559 --> 1365.039
causes and effects and just

1361.919 --> 1365.039
what you can do with it

1365.44 --> 1370.6000000000001
anyway

1367.6 --> 1370.6
uh

1374.4 --> 1378.0
derp alert not i don't know

1378.799 --> 1384.8799999999999
do you have a new opinion why it

1381.84 --> 1387.4399999999998
is that physicists are having a hard

1384.88 --> 1391.8400000000001
time coming up with a theory that can

1387.44 --> 1394.24
include gravity with quantum mechanics

1391.84 --> 1396.0
yeah yeah i do have any opinions about

1394.24 --> 1398.48
that it's

1396.0 --> 1399.44
natural it's perfectly logical you know

1398.48 --> 1401.679
why

1399.44 --> 1405.679
because gravity

1401.679 --> 1405.679
is not actually physics

1406.64 --> 1412.72
it's a concept that has no empirical

1409.2 --> 1414.8400000000001
relations yeah that's also why all these

1412.72 --> 1419.039
other types what is it called again

1414.84 --> 1420.08
the string theory has no gravity in it

1419.039 --> 1421.679
why

1420.08 --> 1424.3999999999999
it's just it's a mechanism it's a

1421.679 --> 1426.799
mechanism of patterns it is a structure

1424.4 --> 1429.6000000000001
right or the gravity does yeah because

1426.799 --> 1431.679
gravity is not real

1429.6 --> 1432.559
and so it's not compatible on a micro

1431.679 --> 1435.039
level

1432.559 --> 1437.52
it's that simple yeah you can't get

1435.039 --> 1439.76
gravity in because it's not compatible

1437.52 --> 1442.8799999999999
because it's not real

1439.76 --> 1445.52
it's only compatible with heliocentric

1442.88 --> 1448.0
models

1445.52 --> 1450.48
not reality

1448.0 --> 1450.48
you see

1452.64 --> 1457.5200000000002
so yeah quantum mechanics is not going

1455.2 --> 1460.96
to be influenced by gravity because

1457.52 --> 1460.96
gravity doesn't exist

1461.039 --> 1463.279
yeah

1464.0 --> 1470.72
and quantum mechanics even includes the

1467.679 --> 1473.52
pattern descriptions if i'm correct

1470.72 --> 1475.919
it has tried to describe so many things

1473.52 --> 1479.52
and mostly successful

1475.919 --> 1483.6000000000001
but that includes relative density

1479.52 --> 1486.48
but there is no gravity influence as the

1483.6 --> 1489.279
concept suggests like a field of

1486.48 --> 1492.08
influence it doesn't exist

1489.279 --> 1495.6
there is no gravity

1492.08 --> 1496.48
so it's not going to be integratable

1495.6 --> 1497.6789999999999
with

1496.48 --> 1500.72
systems

1497.679 --> 1503.44
that are specifically trying to

1500.72 --> 1507.08
create the logical consistent pattern of

1503.44 --> 1507.0800000000002
things in reality

1514.72 --> 1519.84
right space and time gravity or

1517.52 --> 1521.279
or newtonian mass attracting mass

1519.84 --> 1524.8799999999999
gravity either

1521.279 --> 1528.159
are not integratable in real

1524.88 --> 1531.0390000000002
deep analytical systems

1528.159 --> 1533.3600000000001
like mechanisms patterns

1531.039 --> 1535.12
that try to describe the functioning of

1533.36 --> 1537.36
actual reality

1535.12 --> 1538.2399999999998
it's not integratable because it's not

1537.36 --> 1541.279
real

1538.24 --> 1543.84
space and time or mass attracting mass

1541.279 --> 1545.84
there is no such influence that's why it

1543.84 --> 1548.9599999999998
is elusive that's why it's

1545.84 --> 1548.9599999999998
not integratable

1549.84 --> 1552.84
ah

1560.559 --> 1564.559
right so

1562.4 --> 1568.919
where's everybody man

1564.559 --> 1568.9189999999999
yeah this chat is so silent

1570.32 --> 1573.12
but yeah

1573.919 --> 1576.159
see

1576.32 --> 1579.76
so yeah so you can start with see i

1577.919 --> 1581.5200000000002
don't know why you called that derp

1579.76 --> 1584.48
alert

1581.52 --> 1586.1589999999999
because it was actually a very

1584.48 --> 1588.559
refined question

1586.159 --> 1590.3200000000002
that is sensible and i answered it in

1588.559 --> 1592.72
detail right

1590.32 --> 1595.6
he didn't like oh you're stupid or

1592.72 --> 1596.48
something you didn't get all whiny it's

1595.6 --> 1598.559
just

1596.48 --> 1600.88
asking a question like hey why doesn't

1598.559 --> 1602.96
gravity integrate with quantum mechanics

1600.88 --> 1604.0
it's a good question the answer is

1602.96 --> 1606.24
because

1604.0 --> 1608.559
quantum mechanics is a is it like a

1606.24 --> 1612.159
pattern deriving system

1608.559 --> 1614.8799999999999
of physical reality gravity is a concept

1612.159 --> 1615.919
it is not based on physical reality and

1614.88 --> 1618.64
is

1615.919 --> 1620.4
specifically tied into heliocentric

1618.64 --> 1622.72
model conception

1620.4 --> 1624.4
which isn't real

1622.72 --> 1627.84
so that's the answer to that question

1624.4 --> 1627.8400000000001
it's not a bad question

1628.159 --> 1631.159
huh

1640.48 --> 1646.039
hmm invitation is the dirt form of

1642.32 --> 1646.039
flattery for sure

1650.22 --> 1653.44
[Music]

1659.36 --> 1662.8799999999999
right

1660.72 --> 1666.559
imitation

1662.88 --> 1668.96
is a form of flattery and then you have

1666.559 --> 1673.36
assimilation

1668.96 --> 1676.919
and that is like the ultimate compliment

1673.36 --> 1676.9189999999999
when you attune

1684.88 --> 1688.48
okay man and like me

1686.72 --> 1692.72
listening because i'm kicking gravity's

1688.48 --> 1692.72
ass well it's not really tough you know

1694.32 --> 1698.24
on the other hand you can't technically

1696.399 --> 1701.9189999999999
touch gravity because it isn't real it

1698.24 --> 1704.96
only exists in the imagination

1701.919 --> 1704.96
just like ether

1709.2 --> 1715.039
ether only exists because of the

1712.159 --> 1715.0390000000002
persistent

1715.559 --> 1720.6399999999999
misconception

1717.36 --> 1723.36
based on bias think or like duality

1720.64 --> 1724.64
thinking that light is a wave it isn't

1723.36 --> 1727.279
done

1724.64 --> 1730.5590000000002
immediately ether is all gone it's all

1727.279 --> 1733.12
gone all of it it's all gone

1730.559 --> 1735.76
all these patterns and all these cute

1733.12 --> 1739.6
things that could be

1735.76 --> 1742.24
potentially proof it's all gone

1739.6 --> 1742.24
immediately

1742.32 --> 1746.24
right

1743.76 --> 1749.039
that's ether light ether it's all gone

1746.24 --> 1750.799
because light isn't a wave gravity

1749.039 --> 1752.96
whether it's space-time bending or mass

1750.799 --> 1756.0
attracting mass

1752.96 --> 1758.32
it's super cute idea but as soon as you

1756.0 --> 1760.72
realize the heliocentric model is not

1758.32 --> 1762.799
real it's all gone immediately because

1760.72 --> 1764.72
that's the only place it existed based

1762.799 --> 1766.96
on the conception on the presupposition

1764.72 --> 1770.559
that the heliocentric model is real

1766.96 --> 1773.919
that's where it exists in that model

1770.559 --> 1775.279
just like ether only exists

1773.919 --> 1777.039
within

1775.279 --> 1780.08
a frame of thinking based on the

1777.039 --> 1783.679
misconception that light is a wave

1780.08 --> 1785.6789999999999
and thus is like secondary to a medium

1783.679 --> 1790.679
which would be ether and you could never

1785.679 --> 1790.679
change it and blah blah blah nonsense

1795.76 --> 1802.039
your thinking stool has gone missing uh

1797.84 --> 1802.039
that sucks ready to go

1820.08 --> 1824.799
all right so anyway in this whole

1822.72 --> 1827.52
discovery journey where we're

1824.799 --> 1829.44
trying to stick to physics as much as we

1827.52 --> 1831.679
can even though we're drawing in a lot

1829.44 --> 1834.72
of esoterics metaphysics

1831.679 --> 1834.72
spirit mechanics

1834.799 --> 1840.1589999999999
it's very important to really figure out

1839.279 --> 1841.84
that

1840.159 --> 1844.0800000000002
in the discovery journey you're going to

1841.84 --> 1846.24
be facing aberrations

1844.08 --> 1849.039
and there's aberrations that we haven't

1846.24 --> 1851.76
that i even haven't just haven't figured

1849.039 --> 1854.96
out yet that it is an aberration or i

1851.76 --> 1857.919
wasn't ready yet to give into it

1854.96 --> 1859.919
when i did notice it

1857.919 --> 1861.44
because i notice [ __ ] all the time it's

1859.919 --> 1862.96
basically like everything is fake

1861.44 --> 1865.76
everything is fake everything is fake

1862.96 --> 1868.64
but i'm just not capable of grasping how

1865.76 --> 1870.1589999999999
so i can't accept it

1868.64 --> 1872.3200000000002
but i already have like all the

1870.159 --> 1874.0800000000002
preliminary information and i can't do

1872.32 --> 1875.9189999999999
anything with it

1874.08 --> 1877.9189999999999
but there will be a time where there's

1875.919 --> 1881.1200000000001
going to be more right gravity is an

1877.919 --> 1884.3200000000002
aberration ether is an aberration

1881.12 --> 1887.039
there's going to be more aberrations

1884.32 --> 1888.6399999999999
you could argue that the mandela effect

1887.039 --> 1891.36
is

1888.64 --> 1893.6000000000001
an aberration

1891.36 --> 1895.4399999999998
like the idea of the mandela effect is

1893.6 --> 1898.1589999999999
an aberration when it is

1895.44 --> 1901.039
very psychological in nature and that's

1898.159 --> 1904.24
the thing about aberrations in general

1901.039 --> 1905.519
aberrations are highly suggestive in

1904.24 --> 1906.88
nature

1905.519 --> 1909.76
they make you

1906.88 --> 1912.72
want to latch onto that because it's so

1909.76 --> 1915.6
stable and simple

1912.72 --> 1917.44
and it seems so connected but it isn't

1915.6 --> 1919.6789999999999
really that's an aberration it's like a

1917.44 --> 1921.76
seductive ghost that just wants you to

1919.679 --> 1923.76
believe in it even though you you'll

1921.76 --> 1926.32
never be able to prove it

1923.76 --> 1928.72
that's an aberration

1926.32 --> 1931.2
everybody that wants to figure out

1928.72 --> 1934.24
things on a higher level is gonna face

1931.2 --> 1936.72
aberrations and if they overcome the

1934.24 --> 1939.279
aberration then they will be facing

1936.72 --> 1942.159
other people's aberrations that don't

1939.279 --> 1945.679
overcome it and that will fight you

1942.159 --> 1945.679
because you are letting go

1946.84 --> 1952.1589999999999
right it's all part of the struggle

1954.24 --> 1958.1200000000001
hey jeff guess it

1968.559 --> 1972.559
is my sound coming through good yeah

1970.32 --> 1974.32
yeah right it seems fine

1972.559 --> 1977.44
maybe a bit low

1974.32 --> 1980.32
is my sound low or

1977.44 --> 1980.3200000000002
or is it just

1988.84 --> 1993.279
fine without the magnifying glass of the

1991.679 --> 1996.3990000000001
internet i don't believe mandela effect

1993.279 --> 1997.2
would even be recognized

1996.399 --> 1998.9599999999998
no

1997.2 --> 2002.32
no

1998.96 --> 2005.519
i was faced with the mandela effect

2002.32 --> 2008.0
very early before i was very much on the

2005.519 --> 2012.24
internet it's just that the internet has

2008.0 --> 2015.6
been used to basically chant the idea

2012.24 --> 2015.6
the fictional part of it

2016.84 --> 2022.6399999999999
but i've been faced like with

2020.48 --> 2024.48
aberrations of the mind like where

2022.64 --> 2027.2
you're watching something it's super

2024.48 --> 2030.64
intense you're you're pulled into it and

2027.2 --> 2032.159
then they say something that's slightly

2030.64 --> 2034.88
off

2032.159 --> 2035.7600000000002
like they say it wrong

2034.88 --> 2039.0390000000002
like

2035.76 --> 2041.679
for the energy they say it wrong

2039.039 --> 2043.519
they change something and how it was

2041.679 --> 2044.72
supposed to be said

2043.519 --> 2047.2
you see

2044.72 --> 2050.079
to your mind in that moment and it will

2047.2 --> 2052.8
return the pattern will reoccur it's on

2050.079 --> 2055.76
purpose they did it wrong on purpose to

2052.8 --> 2058.0
initiate a mandela effect because your

2055.76 --> 2060.159
mind is going to remember it in the

2058.0 --> 2064.079
corrected way

2060.159 --> 2064.079
not in the original way

2066.399 --> 2071.1189999999997
and that is the mandela effect it's

2068.56 --> 2074.359
basically screwing with you

2071.119 --> 2076.639
and it's like a tactic it's an

2074.359 --> 2078.24
advertisement tactic i think that's

2076.639 --> 2080.159
where it started

2078.24 --> 2082.7999999999997
having weird names that are like

2080.159 --> 2084.2400000000002
slightly wrong

2082.8 --> 2086.48
and then your mind is going to be like

2084.24 --> 2088.3199999999997
ah every time it faces like that product

2086.48 --> 2090.0
name is slightly wrong is something

2088.32 --> 2091.04
wrong with it

2090.0 --> 2093.76
that

2091.04 --> 2095.359
will potentially initiate a mandela

2093.76 --> 2097.6800000000003
effect and then either you will have a

2095.359 --> 2099.92
corrected version that you remember it

2097.68 --> 2102.24
about or you will say it differently

2099.92 --> 2105.04
right you you know you disagree with how

2102.24 --> 2107.2799999999997
it's supposedly suggested to be

2105.04 --> 2108.8
pronounced the name you disagree with

2107.28 --> 2111.119
that and then you remember the corrected

2108.8 --> 2114.1600000000003
version

2111.119 --> 2116.0
right or you'll just really stay

2114.16 --> 2117.92
confused and stay away from it and then

2116.0 --> 2119.839
you'll hate it because it's just ugly

2117.92 --> 2122.079
and you can't auto correct it in your

2119.839 --> 2122.0789999999997
head

2123.44 --> 2129.44
i think the mandela effect influence

2126.0 --> 2132.16
started within advertisement within well

2129.44 --> 2133.76
the social engineering grassroots just

2132.16 --> 2135.5989999999997
like oh how can we [ __ ] around with

2133.76 --> 2137.76
people to

2135.599 --> 2139.6800000000003
to create a response and how can we

2137.76 --> 2142.6400000000003
control that and that's where they

2139.68 --> 2144.3999999999996
started screwing around with it

2142.64 --> 2146.96
and then later i guess it's been

2144.4 --> 2148.56
integrated with with movies and all that

2146.96 --> 2150.88
so

2148.56 --> 2154.16
but i think personally i have a strong

2150.88 --> 2156.48
suspicion i haven't dug the research not

2154.16 --> 2158.72
done my own research

2156.48 --> 2159.92
but i have kind of like just looked and

2158.72 --> 2161.9199999999996
remembered

2159.92 --> 2163.52
and thinking about it

2161.92 --> 2166.079
and

2163.52 --> 2168.96
i'm quite confident

2166.079 --> 2170.1600000000003
that mandela effect influences those

2168.96 --> 2171.839
tricks

2170.16 --> 2174.48
that they started

2171.839 --> 2176.24
within the advertisement

2174.48 --> 2178.32
community

2176.24 --> 2179.68
like in the 20th century that's who

2178.32 --> 2181.28
figured it out

2179.68 --> 2184.0789999999997
that's what i believe

2181.28 --> 2185.599
they have absolutely no evidence for it

2184.079 --> 2188.32
whatsoever

2185.599 --> 2192.48
if you do your own research you might

2188.32 --> 2195.28
find out that i turn out to be correct

2192.48 --> 2195.28
that's what i do

2197.04 --> 2202.2
in india every product has a mandela

2199.44 --> 2205.27
affected name really

2202.2 --> 2205.27
[Music]

2205.76 --> 2210.079
well it's not a mandela effect it you

2207.92 --> 2212.88
have to realize that the mandela effect

2210.079 --> 2214.88
is the suggestion that it changed

2212.88 --> 2218.079
right but it didn't

2214.88 --> 2220.7200000000003
it it was always wrong and they it was

2218.079 --> 2224.2000000000003
wrong on purpose and your mind wants to

2220.72 --> 2224.2
correct it

2234.64 --> 2238.72
yes

2235.599 --> 2238.7200000000003
prince smooth

2238.96 --> 2242.88
i've yeah i've heard of eric for linda

2241.599 --> 2244.48
he's a dutch

2242.88 --> 2248.079
guy

2244.48 --> 2248.079
this he's kind of interesting

2248.48 --> 2252.8
i don't know if we'd get along though

2254.72 --> 2259.2799999999997
i don't remember even if he was like

2256.8 --> 2260.88
honest about flat earth and everything

2259.28 --> 2262.7200000000003
i think he might still be a baller i'm

2260.88 --> 2263.92
not sure

2262.72 --> 2266.16
but

2263.92 --> 2269.52
yeah eric for linda has been around for

2266.16 --> 2272.7999999999997
a while i've never really been like

2269.52 --> 2272.8
on to him or anything

2275.359 --> 2279.44
but

2276.16 --> 2283.04
if he somehow comes up in the attention

2279.44 --> 2284.96
then i will absolutely take a look at it

2283.04 --> 2287.52
because there isn't anything about him

2284.96 --> 2289.52
that i can remember at this point that

2287.52 --> 2291.7599999999998
tells me like that person's like bad

2289.52 --> 2295.64
news or anything so

2291.76 --> 2295.6400000000003
yeah we'll see

2310.32 --> 2316.1600000000003
means small scale company they copy name

2314.079 --> 2319.2000000000003
of mnc

2316.16 --> 2319.2
to sell their product

2319.599 --> 2324.0
well that's almost plagiarizing then

2321.839 --> 2325.92
they're at 306.

2324.0 --> 2327.52
or was that plagiarizing it's like

2325.92 --> 2329.839
taking

2327.52 --> 2330.72
the familiarity of

2329.839 --> 2333.2
a

2330.72 --> 2335.2
an icon or a title

2333.2 --> 2338.48
and then using it

2335.2 --> 2338.48
it's almost like bootlegging

2339.359 --> 2343.119
right apparently that that happens a lot

2341.359 --> 2345.7599999999998
in india i guess

2343.119 --> 2348.48
territory 306. i i don't know what i

2345.76 --> 2348.48
don't live there

2350.48 --> 2354.72
oh you say it as a joke you miss it

2352.32 --> 2355.599
every time i mean it's so great to be

2354.72 --> 2357.9199999999996
like

2355.599 --> 2360.48
jokey and sarcastic when i'm talking

2357.92 --> 2362.56
about detailed spirit mechanics and

2360.48 --> 2364.72
getting super serious it's the ultimate

2362.56 --> 2366.7999999999997
time to get sarcastic and sneak in a

2364.72 --> 2370.9199999999996
joke that of course i'm not gonna pick

2366.8 --> 2370.92
up on hello

2384.079 --> 2388.1600000000003
have you heard of marco rodin no

2388.4 --> 2392.2400000000002
that doesn't ring a bell

2390.16 --> 2393.2799999999997
i mean it might have come

2392.24 --> 2395.52
like

2393.28 --> 2398.32
i can buy or something at some point i

2395.52 --> 2398.32
forgot about it

2409.68 --> 2415.2
adidas becomes a b does i have no idea

2412.88 --> 2415.2000000000003
dude

2419.599 --> 2424.319
so are you saying there's like a

2422.0 --> 2427.2
shoe company

2424.319 --> 2430.0
in india that calls themselves

2427.2 --> 2430.0
adibas

2430.96 --> 2435.96
that is

2431.92 --> 2435.96
super sneaky and hilarious

2451.44 --> 2454.079
wow

2452.4 --> 2456.88
you're gonna become a member and then

2454.079 --> 2456.88
insert that

2457.52 --> 2459.839
dude

2458.88 --> 2462.839
that's

2459.839 --> 2462.839
gross

2466.8 --> 2470.0
if that's going to be the insert of your

2468.8 --> 2472.4
comments

2470.0 --> 2475.119
i appreciate you becoming a member but i

2472.4 --> 2476.48
will still ban you though

2475.119 --> 2479.52
yeah

2476.48 --> 2483.0
this chat is not for that sort of talk

2479.52 --> 2483.0
it's fan balance

2485.38 --> 2488.7490000000003
[Music]

2492.64 --> 2495.9
[Music]

2497.44 --> 2501.76
adidas after dinner i did a [ __ ]

2503.52 --> 2508.839
that

2505.2 --> 2508.839
that is uncanny

2511.28 --> 2516.8
really nike becomes nike with two eyes

2514.0 --> 2516.8
nike

2516.96 --> 2521.48
you know what nike means in french

2528.48 --> 2534.2400000000002
let's just say that the french felt kind

2531.2 --> 2536.319
of screwed over by nike becoming like

2534.24 --> 2539.319
one of the most popular international

2536.319 --> 2539.319
brands

2554.24 --> 2559.1189999999997
that was a language joke

2556.8 --> 2562.8390000000004
i don't know if you got it

2559.119 --> 2562.839

2584.16 --> 2589.319
informed about

okay fractals

oh my god

2621.76 --> 2627.3590000000004
nerd overload this reminds me of so many

2624.48 --> 2628.96
things from my past

2627.359 --> 2631.2
used to be obsessed with this sort of

2628.96 --> 2631.2
thing

2632.0 --> 2636.48
very interesting

2635.04 --> 2639.7599999999998
but i'm not going to watch that right

2636.48 --> 2639.76
now but i will link it up

2641.76 --> 2646.2000000000003
thank you for that at least g

2653.76 --> 2659.7200000000003

2690.72 --> 2694.56
dude yeah matthew hall

2693.28 --> 2696.96
interesting

2694.56 --> 2698.16
i'm not wondering why terret why isn't

2696.96 --> 2703.44
there

2698.16 --> 2703.44
a car company in india called platt

2703.839 --> 2707.839
it's just like fiat

2705.76 --> 2710.6400000000003
except

2707.839 --> 2712.319
like there the i becomes an l very

2710.64 --> 2716.2799999999997
similar i mean

2712.319 --> 2716.2799999999997
and it would be called flat

2723.599 --> 2726.599
okay

2739.04 --> 2742.92
oh yeah but

2750.85 --> 2754.0099999999998
[Music]

2754.88 --> 2758.319
right

2756.56 --> 2760.48
should be pronounced same okay well then

2758.319 --> 2764.079
just make it fiat

2760.48 --> 2767.28
with the i as a capital letter

2764.079 --> 2767.28
it's pretty much flat

2771.839 --> 2776.96
feet at ea

2774.4 --> 2779.359
yeah maybe

2776.96 --> 2781.92
or with a j

2779.359 --> 2781.92
or something

2786.56 --> 2789.2799999999997
but yeah but the problem though is that

2788.24 --> 2791.1189999999997
feet

2789.28 --> 2794.8
is like a very

2791.119 --> 2796.1600000000003
it's a like widely utilized word

2794.8 --> 2798.7200000000003
so that

2796.16 --> 2803.0
would very much distract away from that

2798.72 --> 2803.0
it's actually based on fiat

2803.52 --> 2808.8
i guess it's not as easy

2806.56 --> 2811.359
it's not always easy to do that little

2808.8 --> 2811.3590000000004
trixie

2811.76 --> 2816.6800000000003
it only works with some things

2819.04 --> 2825.88
so there is i i love that sort of like

2821.599 --> 2825.88
bootlegging type gimmickry

2894.72 --> 2898.24
you're actually a serious company then

2896.72 --> 2900.16
fonts

2898.24 --> 2902.0789999999997
if you get too weird with it will be

2900.16 --> 2904.0
problematic

2902.079 --> 2905.76
right

2904.0 --> 2908.16
or it's simply always going to stay

2905.76 --> 2908.1600000000003

is hugo cars

2973.52 --> 2977.119
what is this

2974.72 --> 2979.7599999999998
car was the pits i don't know what that

2977.119 --> 2979.76
even means

2980.319 --> 2984.68
you would say wanted money instead

2985.359 --> 2988.359
okay

3011.599 --> 3017.48
yord

3012.64 --> 3017.48
before it becomes fjord that's hilarious

oh okay tony

3031.92 --> 3034.2400000000002
thanks

3038.4 --> 3042.48
the video was called houston we have a

3040.48 --> 3046.079
problem i mean oh

3042.48 --> 3048.16
well if i type that in i'm sure i'm

3046.079 --> 3050.6400000000003
gonna find it back

3048.16 --> 3052.96
right i mean it's not like that title

3050.64 --> 3055.839
would have been used like a hundred

3052.96 --> 3055.839
thousand times

3057.359 --> 3061.92
like by everything in everybody

3064.48 --> 3069.359
right so yeah that's not

3066.16 --> 3070.3999999999996
helpful in the slightest but

3069.359 --> 3072.319
okay

3070.4 --> 3074.319
i guess there was a

3072.319 --> 3078.16
hugo car deal

3074.319 --> 3080.4
in exchange for a space program

3078.16 --> 3083.1189999999997
related thing and then

3080.4 --> 3084.48
the usa rejected the car because they

3083.119 --> 3086.4
said it sucked

3084.48 --> 3089.04
okay

3086.4 --> 3090.96
there's no possible way for me

3089.04 --> 3094.24
like how i know how to dig on the

3090.96 --> 3096.559
internet to find anything about that but

3094.24 --> 3098.7999999999997
thanks

3096.559 --> 3101.52
or they buried it dude if they have the

3098.8 --> 3105.2000000000003
title houston we have a problem

3101.52 --> 3107.119
this completely unfindable

3105.2 --> 3109.2
that's like the worst title you could

3107.119 --> 3112.1600000000003
give a video ever

3109.2 --> 3113.1189999999997
because that's such a widespread saying

3112.16 --> 3116.96
like

3113.119 --> 3119.44
everybody likes to say that everybody

3116.96 --> 3121.92
every [ __ ] that doesn't even know how

3119.44 --> 3124.319
to talk on the internet knows that

3121.92 --> 3127.119
saying and likes to use that how the

3124.319 --> 3129.599
[ __ ] are you gonna find any video based

3127.119 --> 3131.52
on that title you want

3129.599 --> 3133.3590000000004
unless you like digging through like a

3131.52 --> 3137.0
million videos in the hope to come

3133.359 --> 3137.0
across the right one

3139.92 --> 3147.359
tactics oh you what you want to relate

3143.92 --> 3150.7200000000003
to everybody and get the click

3147.359 --> 3153.7599999999998
or good luck that might work and then

3150.72 --> 3155.68
after that's over nobody's ever gonna

3153.76 --> 3156.6400000000003
find your video back

3155.68 --> 3158.7999999999997
you see

3156.64 --> 3160.16
that's the consequence of that

3158.8 --> 3163.2000000000003
if you want to be

3160.16 --> 3167.2799999999997
findable throughout time you gotta have

3163.2 --> 3169.839
a unique signature not over generalized

3167.28 --> 3171.8390000000004
crap that you think everybody's going to

3169.839 --> 3173.44
click on because they relate to it yeah

3171.839 --> 3174.88
that means that everybody else is going

3173.44 --> 3178.68
to do it too and your video is going to

3174.88 --> 3178.6800000000003
be completely unfindable

3180.559 --> 3184.88
this is not criticizing towards you by

3183.04 --> 3185.7599999999998
the way tony whitcomb

3184.88 --> 3188.76
but

3185.76 --> 3188.76
yeah

3199.44 --> 3203.52
i mean if you could find it back that

3201.359 --> 3205.2
would be pretty cool but yeah

3203.52 --> 3207.119
with the name like a title like that

3205.2 --> 3210.3999999999996
there's just no way that anybody could

3207.119 --> 3212.2400000000002
find that video if they don't know

3210.4 --> 3214.079
if they wouldn't recognize it when they

3212.24 --> 3216.9199999999996
see it you see

3214.079 --> 3218.96
it's just no way

3216.92 --> 3221.599
[Music]

3218.96 --> 3223.119
unless you have like the channel name

3221.599 --> 3224.48

3223.119 --> 3226.96
other

3224.48 --> 3229.119
searchable traits

3226.96 --> 3230.559
about it

3229.119 --> 3233.28
anyway

3230.559 --> 3234.8
are you gonna look okay cool well maybe

3233.28 --> 3239.4
you will find it

3234.8 --> 3239.4
you at least have a memory of the video

3252.4 --> 3254.96
you know what

3257.599 --> 3261.44
lindstones and the jetsons lived at the

3259.92 --> 3265.04
same time

3261.44 --> 3265.04
different social classes

3270.319 --> 3275.44
the higher class knew that the comet was

3274.16 --> 3277.7599999999998
coming

3275.44 --> 3280.319
and forced the lower class to work in

3277.76 --> 3280.3190000000004
the mines

3281.44 --> 3284.44
what

3294.319 --> 3298.079
that's

3295.28 --> 3300.4
interesting i guess it reminds me then

3298.079 --> 3302.6400000000003
of elysium

3300.4 --> 3305.52
that's like the suggestion that like if

3302.64 --> 3308.48
you merge flintstones and the jetsons

3305.52 --> 3310.88
that you basically get elysium

3308.48 --> 3313.28
that's a very interesting

3310.88 --> 3314.88
postulation i don't think that they had

3313.28 --> 3317.44
that in mind though when they were

3314.88 --> 3317.44
making it

3319.119 --> 3323.52
although there i think there might be

3321.04 --> 3325.04
like a time travel crossover thing that

3323.52 --> 3327.68
happened at one point though where they

3325.04 --> 3329.599
do meet each other

3327.68 --> 3331.2799999999997
i'm not sure if that actually happened

3329.599 --> 3333.119
but i think

3331.28 --> 3335.0400000000004
they are in the same time and they did

3333.119 --> 3337.599
crossovers back then a lot because it

3335.04 --> 3339.2
was very popular to do that

3337.599 --> 3341.28
so

3339.2 --> 3344.3999999999996
interesting interesting thing to think

3341.28 --> 3344.4
about though elise g

3344.48 --> 3347.96
hey dan winfield

3368.0 --> 3373.44
a little annoying green man that is in

3370.16 --> 3375.44
both flintstones and jetsons

3373.44 --> 3377.28
well the thing is matthew whole they

3375.44 --> 3379.44
were basically made

3377.28 --> 3381.2000000000003
by the same maker right

3379.44 --> 3385.2000000000003
so the maker

3381.2 --> 3388.0789999999997
used the same cosmology

3385.2 --> 3390.5589999999997
for his entire cartoon universe in which

3388.079 --> 3392.96
flintstones was

3390.559 --> 3395.76
the representation of supposed ancient

3392.96 --> 3398.88
times and the jetsons was the supposed

3395.76 --> 3402.4
representation of the futurist times

3398.88 --> 3405.119
but they were effectively in the same

3402.4 --> 3409.44
universe right that was

3405.119 --> 3410.6400000000003
the han was hannah barbara universe

3409.44 --> 3413.2000000000003
was it

3410.64 --> 3414.319
i might get the names wrong sorry

3413.2 --> 3416.72
but

3414.319 --> 3419.359
i do know about that the styles the same

3416.72 --> 3421.839
it's the same time period it's the same

3419.359 --> 3425.04
makers i'm very sure that they were made

3421.839 --> 3427.7599999999998
by both by the same company and the same

3425.04 --> 3429.7599999999998
art team

3427.76 --> 3431.76
so it seemed to me always like that's

3429.76 --> 3434.1600000000003
just the same universe once in the past

3431.76 --> 3437.3590000000004
once in the future

3434.16 --> 3437.359
it's like obvious

3439.44 --> 3444.88
flintstones flat earth quotes oh god

3443.44 --> 3447.599
yeah

3444.88 --> 3451.44
a weird flat earth quotes man they're in

3447.599 --> 3451.44
so many things it's so weird

3456.0 --> 3460.92
hannah barbara i got it i got it right

3457.92 --> 3460.92
cool

3476.0 --> 3479.68
oh

3476.799 --> 3481.92
tony whitcomb you found it

3479.68 --> 3481.9199999999996

hmm

3506.559 --> 3512.2400000000002
wow i can't believe you found it but it

3508.4 --> 3514.319

3525.44 --> 3529.4

3532.24 --> 3536.799
you said you watched that a long long

3535.04 --> 3538.5589999999997
time ago so that's

3536.799 --> 3541.559
pretty impressive you find it back that

talking about how you can see farther

3761.92 --> 3767.52
close to the plane

3764.0 --> 3769.839
than you can if you raise your altitude

3767.52 --> 3769.839
what

3777.839 --> 3780.839
how

3790.079 --> 3794.96
i don't think so right i mean site is

3792.96 --> 3797.92
still going to be limited by the amount

3794.96 --> 3800.64
of matter you're looking through

3797.92 --> 3802.64
right because

3800.64 --> 3804.24
it's like very

3802.64 --> 3806.96
a lot of moist in the air you're not

3804.24 --> 3809.2799999999997
gonna see as far right so think about it

3806.96 --> 3811.119
at ground level you're looking through

3809.28 --> 3813.8390000000004
thicker air

3811.119 --> 3814.88
because of the gradient

3813.839 --> 3816.799
right

3814.88 --> 3818.4
than when you're high up unless you're

3816.799 --> 3820.799
going to be looking through clouds right

3818.4 --> 3823.6800000000003
that's going to obstruct things but

3820.799 --> 3826.559
it's a clear day then higher up there's

3823.68 --> 3827.68
less gas you're looking through as you

3826.559 --> 3830.4
look

3827.68 --> 3832.0
horizontally

3830.4 --> 3834.88
like it's like you only have to look

3832.0 --> 3837.839
like through half the amount of air

3834.88 --> 3841.6400000000003
effectively so you should be able to see

3837.839 --> 3841.64
further because of that

3857.44 --> 3863.119
the new black swan to oh another one

3859.839 --> 3863.119
clutch no i haven't seen that

3863.28 --> 3865.119
there's

3864.079 --> 3867.039
but yeah

3865.119 --> 3869.359
there's black swans all over the place

3867.039 --> 3872.48
though right

3869.359 --> 3873.68
you only need one and it's done

3872.48 --> 3876.799
but cool

3873.68 --> 3879.5989999999997
more more awesome

3876.799 --> 3880.96
pictures or i mean yeah footage that's

3879.599 --> 3883.039
great

3880.96 --> 3884.88
he was discussing whether ether was real

3883.039 --> 3887.119
on fvd lesson yeah but i already

3884.88 --> 3892.079
basically laid it out right

3887.119 --> 3895.119
now you you made attempt to contest that

3892.079 --> 3896.319
what i said about ether being an

3895.119 --> 3898.4
aberration

3896.319 --> 3901.359
and why

3898.4 --> 3903.6800000000003
just like gravity

3901.359 --> 3905.68
but if nobody's gonna contest that then

3903.68 --> 3907.839
there's kind of like yeah what else can

3905.68 --> 3909.9199999999996
i say about it i i've already laid it

3907.839 --> 3912.88
down it's just

3909.92 --> 3914.64
ether light ether is

3912.88 --> 3917.119
basically a

3914.64 --> 3919.5989999999997
misconception based on the

3917.119 --> 3922.2400000000002
the presupposition that light is a wave

3919.599 --> 3924.319
which it isn't

3922.24 --> 3927.1189999999997
it's not a wave

3924.319 --> 3929.119
there's no wave particle duality

3927.119 --> 3931.28
it's just different

3929.119 --> 3934.0
it's just different

3931.28 --> 3937.76
and photons aren't even particles

3934.0 --> 3941.52
effectively they're just

3937.76 --> 3941.5200000000004
convention based quanta

3942.24 --> 3948.16
they're just quanta there's just an

3943.92 --> 3950.4
amount a value it isn't a unit

3948.16 --> 3953.5989999999997
right so whatever light is it's not a

3950.4 --> 3956.2400000000002
particle and it's not a wave it's light

3953.599 --> 3958.319
i like to describe it as infinitely

3956.24 --> 3959.7599999999998
divisible beams

3958.319 --> 3962.5589999999997
that are

3959.76 --> 3965.28
well potentially instantaneous

3962.559 --> 3967.44
i just can't really be sure about

3965.28 --> 3969.44
whether it does have a speed or not or

3967.44 --> 3971.839
how that even works

3969.44 --> 3974.079
i just know that it is pretty much

3971.839 --> 3975.0389999999998
effectively instantaneous

3974.079 --> 3977.039
and

3975.039 --> 3979.92
more importantly i have a great

3977.039 --> 3981.6800000000003
suspicion that is infinitely divisible

3979.92 --> 3982.88
it's only bound

3981.68 --> 3984.16
by

3982.88 --> 3986.2400000000002
the

3984.16 --> 3988.799
mechanical limit

3986.24 --> 3990.839
the interaction rate with physical

3988.799 --> 3994.4
matter

3990.839 --> 3995.2
like photoelectric plate

3994.4 --> 3998.48
and

3995.2 --> 4001.7599999999998
that's material material has a amount

3998.48 --> 4005.359
how much energy of the light that can

4001.76 --> 4008.2400000000002
does it require in order to create

4005.359 --> 4009.52
the effect that we can read

4008.24 --> 4011.2799999999997
it's not

4009.52 --> 4014.24
reading you

4011.28 --> 4016.3190000000004
how much light is the minimum amount no

4014.24 --> 4019.9199999999996
it's reading out for you

4016.319 --> 4022.799
how much light it requires before the

4019.92 --> 4024.64
substance responds to it so it says more

4022.799 --> 4028.0
about the size

4024.64 --> 4028.0
of those of the

4028.079 --> 4032.88
of the used molecules

4030.64 --> 4036.48
of the photo's electric plate than it

4032.88 --> 4038.2400000000002
does of the quanta of light that's how i

4036.48 --> 4039.44
see that

4038.24 --> 4041.52
right

4039.44 --> 4044.48
it's not a wave it's not a particle with

4041.52 --> 4044.48
the minimum size

4045.52 --> 4051.2
so done it's something else

4048.96 --> 4051.2
oh

4052.72 --> 4057.68
not enough for a tray of caviar oh

4056.0 --> 4060.0
okay

4057.68 --> 4063.839
i don't really like caviar anyway not

4060.0 --> 4063.839
nothing against it i just don't like it

4065.68 --> 4068.5589999999997
but i'll check it out

4075.52 --> 4080.0
whoa

4077.76 --> 4083.119
i don't know i might get a little bowl

4080.0 --> 4083.119
of caviar for that

4084.48 --> 4090.799
i mean it's not gonna be like a giant

4088.319 --> 4093.7599999999998
giant bowl or anything but why would i

4090.799 --> 4093.7599999999998
want that anyways

4098.08 --> 4103.12
thank you very much tony that's

4100.799 --> 4105.839
very thankful for that thank you for the

4103.12 --> 4105.839
support

4107.12 --> 4111.04
it keeps me going

4110.08 --> 4115.4
if

4111.04 --> 4115.4
paypal doesn't break

4127.199 --> 4133.759
okay paypal is acting weird

4131.04 --> 4136.08
but i think it worked just try

4133.759 --> 4136.08
again

4138.719 --> 4142.56
yeah it worked

4140.239 --> 4144.4
awesome thank you very much tony i

4142.56 --> 4147.279
really appreciate the support you guys

4144.4 --> 4150.159
keep me going

4147.279 --> 4152.56
keep the the financial burdens and

4150.159 --> 4157.239
nightmares off my back so i can just

4152.56 --> 4157.2390000000005
stick to what i'm actually good at

4160.96 --> 4165.92
can memories and knowledge clutter the

4162.88 --> 4165.92
brain as we age

4167.52 --> 4173.839000000001
that's a trick question steamy traveler

4171.279 --> 4176.56
technically

4173.839 --> 4178.799
but what happens what happens when

4176.56 --> 4181.759
people seem to get stuck and they like

4178.799 --> 4183.679
these loops of things in the past why

4181.759 --> 4186.319
why do they do that they're actually

4183.679 --> 4189.4400000000005
holding on to it

4186.319 --> 4191.1990000000005
because they feel like they're gonna

4189.44 --> 4194.0
lose

4191.199 --> 4196.08
those sensories that relate with those

4194.0 --> 4197.84
moments in their past

4196.08 --> 4200.84
they're basically afraid to lose their

4197.84 --> 4200.84
senses

4202.239 --> 4206.959999999999
that's why they keep

4204.32 --> 4209.5199999999995
going back to the old stuff to remind

4206.96 --> 4212.159
themselves to reinvigorate themselves

4209.52 --> 4214.96
with a bit of the energy of that time

4212.159 --> 4217.5199999999995
that's why old people tend to do that

4214.96 --> 4220.2390000000005
i already i'm doing it

4217.52 --> 4222.400000000001
and i'm not even that old

4220.239 --> 4225.12
because it just brings back power and

4222.4 --> 4227.679
when you're old yeah

4225.12 --> 4229.36
you lose a lot of effective things

4227.679 --> 4230.8
you're gonna you

4229.36 --> 4232.48
would do normally when you're much

4230.8 --> 4234.88
younger

4232.48 --> 4237.44
you still want the power you still want

4234.88 --> 4239.04
that sensation somewhat so yeah digging

4237.44 --> 4240.799999999999
back in your memories

4239.04 --> 4244.08
is then the way to do it now if you're

4240.8 --> 4246.08
losing your faculties slowly like you're

4244.08 --> 4248.48
really getting old it's tough it's

4246.08 --> 4250.4
terrible idea to me

4248.48 --> 4251.759999999999
that you would actually lose grip

4250.4 --> 4254.48
completely

4251.76 --> 4255.4400000000005
of your mental situation

4254.48 --> 4256.799999999999
then

4255.44 --> 4259.599999999999
just

4256.8 --> 4262.719
chanting the good memories that give you

4259.6 --> 4265.679
some feeling of cohesion and strength

4262.719 --> 4267.199
is the only thing left you can do

4265.679 --> 4269.52
to hold on

4267.199 --> 4269.5199999999995
right

4270.96 --> 4274.719
so yeah

4273.28 --> 4276.88
i don't blame

4274.719 --> 4279.92
blame old folks for doing that

4276.88 --> 4282.719
like i i my grandma told me like similar

4279.92 --> 4285.1990000000005
stories like 10 times and i would listen

4282.719 --> 4287.92
every single time with love

4285.199 --> 4290.32
like it was the first time

4287.92 --> 4292.88
and she'd really appreciate that and

4290.32 --> 4295.12
like my brother hated that he thought

4292.88 --> 4295.84
like she's getting [ __ ] and i'm like

4295.12 --> 4298.32
no

4295.84 --> 4302.159000000001
no she's getting old

4298.32 --> 4305.12
she just wants to feel that back

4302.159 --> 4308.639999999999
i totally get it so yeah a nostalgia you

4305.12 --> 4308.64
could call it nostalgia but

4309.199 --> 4313.44
nostalgia is different nostalgia is

4311.92 --> 4315.4400000000005
really

4313.44 --> 4317.12
not being able to move on and build

4315.44 --> 4318.96
something new because you're holding on

4317.12 --> 4321.5199999999995
to the past now when you're much older

4318.96 --> 4325.52
you don't have that situation you're old

4321.52 --> 4325.52
you're only losing things really

4326.56 --> 4331.04
right

4327.52 --> 4333.679
so then holding on is keeping it alive

4331.04 --> 4336.0
it's not just nostalgia it nostalgia

4333.679 --> 4337.12
might be the sensation that comes along

4336.0 --> 4339.28
with that

4337.12 --> 4342.48
sure

4339.28 --> 4345.44
but it's not just nostalgia unless

4342.48 --> 4347.36
they're like really bitter

4345.44 --> 4349.759999999999
and like everything's always better in

4347.36 --> 4352.639999999999
the past right

4349.76 --> 4352.64
that just sucks

4354.8 --> 4359.360000000001
but yeah usually people that get like

4357.679 --> 4360.96
that when they're old they don't really

4359.36 --> 4362.799999999999
live that long

4360.96 --> 4366.2390000000005
because that burns you out like

4362.8 --> 4368.96
spitefulness and envy

4366.239 --> 4372.4
really wears on you when you're older

4368.96 --> 4374.4800000000005
it's very unhealthy for your system

4372.4 --> 4376.96
so it's the people that don't do that or

4374.48 --> 4380.48
stop doing that when they're old that

4376.96 --> 4382.159
actually get to live very old and still

4380.48 --> 4385.839999999999
can be like

4382.159 --> 4385.839999999999
useful humans

4385.87 --> 4389.92
[Music]

4387.84 --> 4392.400000000001
what is the ideal amount of sleep for

4389.92 --> 4394.64
people in their middle age

4392.4 --> 4396.08
dude

4394.64 --> 4398.64
that's that

4396.08 --> 4402.5599999999995
that's no uniform there's no uniform

4398.64 --> 4404.2390000000005
answer to that steamy traveler

4402.56 --> 4406.88
there's no uniform

4404.239 --> 4409.36
it completely differs per person and

4406.88 --> 4412.36
what they do with their life

4409.36 --> 4412.36
right

4416.56 --> 4422.400000000001
me personally i like to kind of stick to

4419.76 --> 4422.400000000001
eight hours

4422.48 --> 4428.0
and i know from practical experience

4424.64 --> 4431.76
that the earlier i go to bed

4428.0 --> 4434.0
the better it is for my physical body

4431.76 --> 4435.6
more it gets to regenerate

4434.0 --> 4436.8
right

4435.6 --> 4437.76
but

4436.8 --> 4440.8
yeah

4437.76 --> 4442.88
that if i go to bed later

4440.8 --> 4444.2390000000005
and usually i have a lot of like

4442.88 --> 4447.1990000000005
overactive

4444.239 --> 4448.639999999999
mind situation going which keeps me up

4447.199 --> 4450.96
late

4448.64 --> 4452.8
and then if i rest for like roughly

4450.96 --> 4455.84
eight hours then my mind can still just

4452.8 --> 4455.84
recover properly

4456.08 --> 4459.199
so

4456.8 --> 4461.1990000000005
yeah that's as far as i could go pretty

4459.199 --> 4462.48
much and it all depends per person i

4461.199 --> 4464.5599999999995
know people

4462.48 --> 4467.919999999999
that like barely sleep

4464.56 --> 4470.8
when they sleep they sleep really well

4467.92 --> 4473.4400000000005
and they're just like fully

4470.8 --> 4473.4400000000005
energetic

4474.48 --> 4478.959999999999
so

4475.84 --> 4480.8
it all depends per person and like how

4478.96 --> 4484.4800000000005
you what are you doing

4480.8 --> 4484.4800000000005
what are you doing with your life right

4489.92 --> 4495.04
i mean i've known i've seen around like

4493.04 --> 4497.12
people that just sleep

4495.04 --> 4498.88
less and less actually as they grow

4497.12 --> 4501.88
older weirdly enough

4498.88 --> 4501.88
really

4511.76 --> 4515.280000000001
you just need to feel it out

4515.44 --> 4519.199
that's what i would do that's like that

4517.28 --> 4521.04
would be my first recommendation just

4519.199 --> 4524.239
feel it out

4521.04 --> 4525.5199999999995
and then reflect upon your findings with

4524.239 --> 4528.0
somebody

4525.52 --> 4529.52
that has some knowledge about it and

4528.0 --> 4532.239
then figure out like what would be the

4529.52 --> 4534.320000000001
best right and dude if especially if

4532.239 --> 4535.36
you're like older and like in your 40s

4534.32 --> 4537.44
and all that

4535.36 --> 4540.159
if you have half a brain you already

4537.44 --> 4541.919999999999
know exactly how to deal with that right

4540.159 --> 4543.92
because it's a freaking survival

4541.92 --> 4544.88
situation i mean

4543.92 --> 4548.08
if you

4544.88 --> 4550.0
like have a job and a family or

4548.08 --> 4551.12
just a job whatever

4550.0 --> 4553.04
you have a rhythm you have

4551.12 --> 4556.08
responsibilities of things you need to

4553.04 --> 4557.76
do peak moment you require to be able to

4556.08 --> 4560.48
achieve

4557.76 --> 4562.2390000000005
you're gonna be forced to actually learn

4560.48 --> 4563.919999999999
how to deal with your sleep properly or

4562.239 --> 4564.839999999999
you're literally everything's gonna fall

4563.92 --> 4568.32
apart

4564.84 --> 4570.64
so most people just know how to deal

4568.32 --> 4570.639999999999
with it

4570.8 --> 4575.12
but i can tell you that when i was

4572.719 --> 4578.96
younger especially as a little kid like

4575.12 --> 4582.8
18 i slept a lot

4578.96 --> 4582.8
i loved sleeping

4583.04 --> 4587.679
and didn't necessarily even sleep long i

4585.76 --> 4589.6
would then just sleep

4587.679 --> 4592.4800000000005
wake up in the middle of the night

4589.6 --> 4595.679
like immediately get savage

4592.48 --> 4598.0
inspiration like start building legos or

4595.679 --> 4599.84
drawing stuff

4598.0 --> 4600.96
like all kinds of things and then be

4599.84 --> 4602.719
like uh

4600.96 --> 4605.04
ran out again and then i go back to

4602.719 --> 4605.04
sleep

4606.0 --> 4610.239
right

4607.12 --> 4612.239
i loved sleeping i had so much

4610.239 --> 4613.759999999999
power available

4612.239 --> 4616.0
because of sleep

4613.76 --> 4619.4400000000005
especially when i was a kid

4616.0 --> 4621.52
the dream world was more real had more

4619.44 --> 4623.839999999999
content than the actual world through my

4621.52 --> 4623.84
senses

4624.88 --> 4628.96
and yeah that's also around the time

4627.199 --> 4630.639999999999
where i learned like yeah as you grow

4628.96 --> 4633.04
older you sleep less and less you just

4630.64 --> 4635.84
don't need it as much anymore or it

4633.04 --> 4637.44
doesn't yield as much anymore if you

4635.84 --> 4639.92
find

4637.44 --> 4641.5199999999995
your energy in other ways

4639.92 --> 4642.56
i don't know

4641.52 --> 4644.400000000001
so

4642.56 --> 4647.9800000000005
i hope that sort of answers your

4644.4 --> 4651.349999999999
question steamy traveler

4647.98 --> 4651.349999999999
[Music]

4673.12 --> 4681.599999999999
you've forgotten more than you knew what

4678.88 --> 4681.6
how do you know

4682.8 --> 4688.56
how do you know you've forgotten it all

4685.76 --> 4691.1990000000005
when you don't know what you forgot

4688.56 --> 4695.2390000000005
maybe you stood you still know

4691.199 --> 4695.239
you just forgot it

4698.59 --> 4704.42
[Music]

4710.75 --> 4713.93
[Music]

4728.96 --> 4733.08
sister has brain clutter

4736.88 --> 4741.52
look at memories and knowledge clutter

4739.04 --> 4741.5199999999995
the brain

4744.4 --> 4749.36
oh look

4746.88 --> 4751.84
i'm feeding back to like tony whitcomb's

4749.36 --> 4753.599999999999
response to stevie traveler's interpret

4751.84 --> 4756.56
yeah question that i interpreted

4753.6 --> 4758.2390000000005
slightly differently i guess

4756.56 --> 4760.2390000000005
and it's just that

4758.239 --> 4762.959999999999
i think that yeah

4760.239 --> 4763.759999999999
your brain can clutter potentially if

4762.96 --> 4766.56
you

4763.76 --> 4768.400000000001
don't really have a proper framework

4766.56 --> 4771.52
if you don't have like a rigorous

4768.4 --> 4774.799999999999
discipline that like is more important

4771.52 --> 4774.8
almost than surviving

4775.04 --> 4778.719
right if you don't have the right way to

4777.679 --> 4781.4400000000005
deal

4778.719 --> 4783.84
with your thoughts

4781.44 --> 4786.159
and deal with intense moments with high

4783.84 --> 4788.4800000000005
speed calculation moments for yourself

4786.159 --> 4790.5599999999995
and decompacting and finding a balance

4788.48 --> 4793.199
with all of it

4790.56 --> 4795.52
then eventually if you just kind of keep

4793.199 --> 4798.159
exploiting your system without having

4795.52 --> 4799.84
proper control you're it's going to

4798.159 --> 4802.879999999999
start failing

4799.84 --> 4805.92
and i guess clutter

4802.88 --> 4807.92
if you're gonna keep forcing

4805.92 --> 4810.719
an intensity out of it without the

4807.92 --> 4812.0
proper structural foundations for it the

4810.719 --> 4814.4800000000005
discipline

4812.0 --> 4819.36
built over your lifetime

4814.48 --> 4820.799999999999
eventually it's just gonna start failing

4819.36 --> 4823.199
right

4820.8 --> 4824.719
if you're just squeezing yourself and

4823.199 --> 4826.32
then expect it's just gonna work it's

4824.719 --> 4830.2390000000005
always worked right

4826.32 --> 4832.639
well eventually it's gonna run out

4830.239 --> 4834.718999999999
unless you have a proper

4832.639 --> 4837.4400000000005
well-thought-out structural way of

4834.719 --> 4839.52
approaching it and dealing with your

4837.44 --> 4841.5199999999995
focus and your concentration time and

4839.52 --> 4844.2390000000005
with tension

4841.52 --> 4847.1990000000005
relief unless you have a really

4844.239 --> 4848.879999999999
focused personally responsible system

4847.199 --> 4852.5599999999995
for that built in

4848.88 --> 4854.719
yeah then at some point you will

4852.56 --> 4856.56
start to like feel like i'm getting old

4854.719 --> 4858.4800000000005
i can't do it anymore

4856.56 --> 4861.120000000001
because you didn't build for it you

4858.48 --> 4863.839999999999
didn't build the discipline for your

4861.12 --> 4866.32
internal workings in order to be able to

4863.84 --> 4869.32
maintain it later on

4866.32 --> 4869.32
right

4869.62 --> 4872.76
[Music]

4874.0 --> 4880.32
it's tough to turn

4876.239 --> 4882.5599999999995
our brain off to get a rest yeah yeah

4880.32 --> 4884.08
well there you go that's a discipline

4882.56 --> 4887.84
right

4884.08 --> 4889.5199999999995
you absolutely need to spend a great

4887.84 --> 4891.52
amount of time in your life if you're a

4889.52 --> 4894.080000000001
hyperactive thinker

4891.52 --> 4896.400000000001
to learn to recognize when you're

4894.08 --> 4898.96
overactive like that when you don't want

4896.4 --> 4901.28
it and how to turn it off that's a

4898.96 --> 4904.2390000000005
critical trick if you don't learn that

4901.28 --> 4907.199
it can over time start to literally

4904.239 --> 4907.199
break your mind

4907.92 --> 4911.4400000000005
you have to get a grip on it

4912.96 --> 4916.8
do you think self-driving cars will

4914.48 --> 4918.239
become the norm initiate no

4916.8 --> 4922.8
no never

4918.239 --> 4922.799999999999
it's garbage who would use that [ __ ]

4923.12 --> 4928.8
i mean the accident rate of self-driving

4925.679 --> 4931.84
cars versus actual in real world

4928.8 --> 4934.08
accident rate is preposterous

4931.84 --> 4936.56
i mean

4934.08 --> 4939.5199999999995
people that really know how to drive

4936.56 --> 4941.76
don't get into accidents

4939.52 --> 4944.080000000001
it's numpties that get into accidents

4941.76 --> 4946.8
and then oh self bro automatically

4944.08 --> 4949.5199999999995
driving cars yeah oh now the play field

4946.8 --> 4951.76
for numpties and actual well

4949.52 --> 4953.4400000000005
capable drivers is going to be equal

4951.76 --> 4955.4400000000005
because it's basically a lottery now

4953.44 --> 4956.32
when it goes wrong

4955.44 --> 4957.5199999999995
yeah

4956.32 --> 4962.32
no

4957.52 --> 4966.0
it's a terrible idea terrible idea

4962.32 --> 4969.199
never never self-driving cars never ever

4966.0 --> 4972.32
blow them all up it's garbage

4969.199 --> 4976.638999999999
it's a waste of resources it's a faculty

4972.32 --> 4980.799999999999
destroying operation never do that ever

4976.639 --> 4983.92
never take away driving capability of

4980.8 --> 4986.320000000001
human beings ever it's the worst

4983.92 --> 4988.639
possible decision you could ever make

4986.32 --> 4991.44
for the future of mankind the worst

4988.639 --> 4991.4400000000005
possible

4991.84 --> 4996.4800000000005
never do that burn those devices all of

4995.6 --> 5000.52
it

4996.48 --> 5000.5199999999995
all of it burn them all

5008.48 --> 5014.599999999999
yeah

5009.92 --> 5014.6
i mean you got [ __ ] trains

5016.48 --> 5022.4
that's almost self-driving at least it's

5019.52 --> 5023.84
really controlled it's much safer

5022.4 --> 5026.0
because it's not just like oh the

5023.84 --> 5027.360000000001
program suddenly decides that oh this

5026.0 --> 5029.28
we're going to go this way and then the

5027.36 --> 5031.199
train just

5029.28 --> 5032.159
smashes right into the wall or something

5031.199 --> 5035.36
right

5032.159 --> 5039.28
yeah [ __ ] might go wrong with the rails

5035.36 --> 5039.28
but that's much more tannable

5040.84 --> 5046.719
and yeah it's a hazard i would like

5045.44 --> 5048.96
having a

5046.719 --> 5050.88
not self-driving car in a society of

5048.96 --> 5055.719
self-driving cars

5050.88 --> 5055.719
seems like a lethal hazard to me

5056.159 --> 5062.32
oh but they could be also safe yeah yeah

5058.48 --> 5064.32
until like suddenly it isn't anymore and

5062.32 --> 5066.159
just in one day it's like oh oh

5064.32 --> 5067.199
everybody with the self-driving car

5066.159 --> 5070.08
today

5067.199 --> 5072.32
for some mistake an explicable reason

5070.08 --> 5075.12
within the time span of an hour

5072.32 --> 5077.28
like a hundred million self-driving cars

5075.12 --> 5080.88
always suddenly started driving off

5077.28 --> 5083.5199999999995
cliffs and ramming into one another

5080.88 --> 5085.12
all at the same time

5083.52 --> 5087.679
okay

5085.12 --> 5088.88
is that what you want

5087.679 --> 5089.84
is that what you want that's gonna

5088.88 --> 5092.400000000001
happen

5089.84 --> 5094.96
and that's something that could

5092.4 --> 5097.28
never ever happen

5094.96 --> 5098.4
if you don't have self-driving cars you

5097.28 --> 5101.04
understand

5098.4 --> 5106.36
that could never ever happen if

5101.04 --> 5106.36
everybody drives their own car

5111.52 --> 5121.52
[Music]

5117.44 --> 5126.199
the self-driving cars i just see it as

5121.52 --> 5126.1990000000005
just another euthanasia trap

5126.239 --> 5129.199
that's what it is to me

5132.8 --> 5137.76
collision avoid yeah sure driver

5134.719 --> 5137.76
assistance fine

5138.8 --> 5144.639
but the point is is that

5140.96 --> 5147.04
people should be forced to learn to

5144.639 --> 5147.04
drive

5147.679 --> 5155.12
force if if it is a possibility to them

5151.679 --> 5157.52
to actually use a car

5155.12 --> 5159.12
they must be drivers

5157.52 --> 5160.2390000000005
it is a way of

5159.12 --> 5163.599999999999
de-being

5160.239 --> 5166.0
and doing things that must be maintained

5163.6 --> 5168.0
if it becomes fully automated and nobody

5166.0 --> 5171.76
learns how to drive anymore except for

5168.0 --> 5174.8
sports drivers oh special then everybody

5171.76 --> 5177.1990000000005
becomes more [ __ ] we've already been

5174.8 --> 5179.360000000001
seeing what happens

5177.199 --> 5182.08
in other departments like

5179.36 --> 5184.4
what is like universal mobile phones for

5182.08 --> 5186.88
everybody done like how is that

5184.4 --> 5189.04
degenerated everybody yeah well this

5186.88 --> 5191.04
thing oh suddenly nobody can drive

5189.04 --> 5193.5199999999995
anymore because it's not allowed or it's

5191.04 --> 5198.639
all solved right yeah

5193.52 --> 5198.639
even more [ __ ] worse

5200.48 --> 5204.879999999999
worse people will be worse

5203.36 --> 5207.04
a lot worse

5204.88 --> 5209.76
they're going to be more spoiled more

5207.04 --> 5212.4
arrogant more [ __ ]

5209.76 --> 5215.360000000001
they're going to be just vile hissing

5212.4 --> 5217.199
snake eyed pieces of [ __ ]

5215.36 --> 5221.08
that's what they're going to turn into

5217.199 --> 5221.08
if you normalize this

5232.639 --> 5237.84
so driver's assistance all these things

5235.76 --> 5239.04
sure you know especially if you're like

5237.84 --> 5240.0
a woman

5239.04 --> 5241.44
yeah

5240.0 --> 5244.239
i'd want my

5241.44 --> 5245.759999999999
woman to be able to drive

5244.239 --> 5246.959999999999
and if they're not that good you had

5245.76 --> 5250.08
some

5246.96 --> 5252.96
automated robotic assistance sure

5250.08 --> 5257.36
right why not but i

5252.96 --> 5259.679
would never use that myself

5257.36 --> 5262.5599999999995
never

5259.679 --> 5264.4
yeah i don't even use route planning

5262.56 --> 5266.400000000001
systems

5264.4 --> 5269.36
yeah what i do instead

5266.4 --> 5272.239
is look up the route

5269.36 --> 5277.04
plan it myself

5272.239 --> 5277.04
and then like print out a map

5277.679 --> 5283.92
i never just automatically

5281.84 --> 5284.88
let some robot

5283.92 --> 5288.159
tell me

5284.88 --> 5290.56
where i need to go i don't do it i don't

5288.159 --> 5290.5599999999995
do it

5292.32 --> 5296.32
because i wanna know the route i wanna

5295.36 --> 5299.5199999999995
know it

5296.32 --> 5303.639
i wanna plan it out i don't want a robot

5299.52 --> 5303.639
to tell me where to go

5324.719 --> 5331.44
and trust there isn't a backdoor

5328.159 --> 5333.28
tech to hijack the system dude

5331.44 --> 5336.239
can't trust

5333.28 --> 5338.8
you mean you can trust with absolute

5336.239 --> 5342.32
certainty that there will be a backdoor

5338.8 --> 5345.4400000000005
to hijack the system it's like mandatory

5342.32 --> 5349.28
for these [ __ ] satanic industrialists

5345.44 --> 5351.919999999999
to even do that it's mandatory

5349.28 --> 5354.88
like they don't build things unless

5351.92 --> 5357.28
there is a backdoor to somehow

5354.88 --> 5359.84
assist at some point to suddenly murder

5357.28 --> 5364.12
everybody they don't even design [ __ ]

5359.84 --> 5364.12
anymore that doesn't do that

5365.679 --> 5372.32
they're all [ __ ] insane

5369.36 --> 5376.239
because of these company heads and their

5372.32 --> 5377.92
vile eugenics demon chanting

5376.239 --> 5378.718999999999
that's what's driving that [ __ ] that's

5377.92 --> 5380.0
what

5378.719 --> 5382.159
driving

5380.0 --> 5386.0
it's what's

5382.159 --> 5389.28
laying out these changes that are all

5386.0 --> 5391.92
have a secret clause to kill humanity

5389.28 --> 5394.159
all of it has all of it has clauses for

5391.92 --> 5394.159
that

5394.88 --> 5404.52
it's all built on that option you see

5399.44 --> 5404.5199999999995
all of it is built on those options

5418.0 --> 5423.6
but you're rising demon tech right now

5422.08 --> 5425.92
yeah

5423.6 --> 5425.92
so

5427.679 --> 5432.84
it's not gonna self-destruct i mean the

5430.0 --> 5436.56
worst that could happen it just turns

5432.84 --> 5436.56
off yeah

5437.04 --> 5443.5199999999995
i mean youtube is not going to oh

5440.56 --> 5444.8
suddenly youtube made me crash into a

5443.52 --> 5447.4400000000005
wall

5444.8 --> 5447.4400000000005
or something

5447.6 --> 5451.400000000001
right

5448.4 --> 5451.4
now

5478.639 --> 5482.88
so got anything else howard moore

5483.04 --> 5489.92
tree just trying just trying to um

5487.44 --> 5491.839999999999
trying to create some inconsistencies

5489.92 --> 5494.56
because arwen is wrong of course i'm

5491.84 --> 5496.639
wrong i'm always wrong and you're mine

5494.56 --> 5499.5
right i'm always wrong

5496.639 --> 5501.4400000000005
just trying to dig in there

5499.5 --> 5503.84
[Music]

5501.44 --> 5505.759999999999
is she doing this right now oh are you

5503.84 --> 5506.88
being a hypocrite are you wrong about

5505.76 --> 5509.4400000000005
everything you don't know what you're

5506.88 --> 5513.4800000000005
talking about howard moore is is that

5509.44 --> 5513.48
what's on your mind right now

5519.92 --> 5524.2390000000005
you think i haven't actually

5521.84 --> 5527.28
cross-referenced everything i'm talking

5524.239 --> 5529.5199999999995
about with my actual life

5527.28 --> 5531.5199999999995
yeah i have all of it

5529.52 --> 5537.400000000001
all of it

5531.52 --> 5537.400000000001
beyond your worst nightmares all of it

5549.28 --> 5553.92
they're already in our device yeah but

5551.12 --> 5557.12
that who gives a [ __ ] they can spy on me

5553.92 --> 5562.32
all they want i'm have i'm publicly

5557.12 --> 5564.48
laying down everything everything i know

5562.32 --> 5567.84
i'm throwing it all out i have been for

5564.48 --> 5569.599999999999
years every day why the [ __ ] would i

5567.84 --> 5572.639
give a [ __ ]

5569.6 --> 5575.84
they're spying on me like yeah oh really

5572.639 --> 5578.8
you're spying on me well here i'm saying

5575.84 --> 5582.0
everything i'm saying it all

5578.8 --> 5583.84
without [ __ ] restraints so oh

5582.0 --> 5586.719
oh they're spying on me yeah yeah i

5583.84 --> 5588.719
don't have secrets you get it

5586.719 --> 5592.4800000000005
this is who i am

5588.719 --> 5594.2390000000005
i'm not afraid to be seen to be analyzed

5592.48 --> 5598.638999999999
to be inquired

5594.239 --> 5601.678999999999
i'm not afraid to be seen you get it

5598.639 --> 5605.679
i have a live show every day where i

5601.679 --> 5608.0
talk about deep internal personal things

5605.679 --> 5610.32
and vulnerable things

5608.0 --> 5612.639
and build with it

5610.32 --> 5614.719
you think i give a [ __ ] about being

5612.639 --> 5617.52
spied upon

5614.719 --> 5620.639
i'm like one of the most exposed people

5617.52 --> 5622.96
in the world right now

5620.639 --> 5626.08
as in exposed

5622.96 --> 5628.96
really deeply spiritually like

5626.08 --> 5631.76
potentially vulnerable honest

5628.96 --> 5634.4800000000005
on every level

5631.76 --> 5636.639
you think i'm afraid to be spied upon

5634.48 --> 5640.5599999999995
like there's something i do that i try

5636.639 --> 5640.56
could try to conceal in any way

5640.719 --> 5650.44
it's not realistic i don't have secrets

5645.6 --> 5650.4400000000005
you get it i don't have them

5661.6 --> 5666.88
do they bury malicious code no it's just

5664.0 --> 5671.04
the internet of things there's like

5666.88 --> 5673.84
wi-fi communicators in pretty much every

5671.04 --> 5676.08
yeah every electronic related device

5673.84 --> 5678.8
after 2010

5676.08 --> 5682.8
steam traveler it's in everything it's

5678.8 --> 5684.719
called the internet of things it happens

5682.8 --> 5686.400000000001
but it only happens

5684.719 --> 5687.679
when people

5686.4 --> 5689.36
are not

5687.679 --> 5692.2390000000005
honest

5689.36 --> 5695.119
and are trying

5692.239 --> 5698.48
to put out an image that isn't actually

5695.119 --> 5700.96
them to get control over things or

5698.48 --> 5702.159
people or whatever get an advantage in

5700.96 --> 5705.119
business

5702.159 --> 5707.839999999999
and they're trying to hide things and

5705.119 --> 5710.0
then they have double personalities that

5707.84 --> 5711.6
they like blabber over with some people

5710.0 --> 5713.52
brag about how they're lying about

5711.6 --> 5714.4800000000005
everything right next to their washing

5713.52 --> 5716.719
machine

5714.48 --> 5718.239
yeah guess what that [ __ ] washing

5716.719 --> 5719.679
machine is going to make a record of

5718.239 --> 5722.0
that and it's going to be crossed

5719.679 --> 5725.4400000000005
reference with everything you do so now

5722.0 --> 5728.4
they can use that in court but they know

5725.44 --> 5729.28
that you do that now

5728.4 --> 5731.28
yeah

5729.28 --> 5732.96
that's what that is

5731.28 --> 5736.0
that's the thing

5732.96 --> 5740.96
you want to keep secrets guess what

5736.0 --> 5743.679
there is spies in everything everything

5740.96 --> 5746.0
everything everything

5743.679 --> 5748.4800000000005
in everything every person every

5746.0 --> 5751.679
electronic device

5748.48 --> 5752.799999999999
you're gonna make some real hard effort

5751.679 --> 5755.6
to have

5752.8 --> 5757.92
secret communication that's not somehow

5755.6 --> 5760.0
going to slip through who encrypted this

5757.92 --> 5762.639
encryption that's so cute yeah what

5760.0 --> 5764.08
about right next

5762.639 --> 5766.639
to where you're

5764.08 --> 5769.04
doing something encrypted

5766.639 --> 5771.679
yeah that if it's still going to leak

5769.04 --> 5774.32
out everything is known you get it

5771.679 --> 5775.679
everything is known it's not even the

5774.32 --> 5778.08
problem

5775.679 --> 5779.92
it's only gonna be a problem

5778.08 --> 5783.119
when it will be

5779.92 --> 5785.119
judicially used against you right let's

5783.119 --> 5787.04
not allowed

5785.119 --> 5790.08
it's not allowed

5787.04 --> 5791.92
like that's only only like savage

5790.08 --> 5795.92
communist countries

5791.92 --> 5797.84
just pure dictatorships do that

5795.92 --> 5802.4800000000005
yeah they're all spying on you they've

5797.84 --> 5802.4800000000005
been spying on all of us for ages

5802.56 --> 5809.4400000000005
they have to know they have to know

5805.119 --> 5809.44
what's going on they have to know

5809.6 --> 5815.76
otherwise the entire existence of that

5812.48 --> 5818.48
department intelligence is completely

5815.76 --> 5820.56
useless if they don't know it all

5818.48 --> 5822.799999999999
so it's not a matter of whether you're

5820.56 --> 5825.6
going to accept it or not it's going to

5822.8 --> 5827.04
happen it's already happened it's more a

5825.6 --> 5829.280000000001
matter of it's sort of being

5827.04 --> 5833.679
declassified yeah we're already all

5829.28 --> 5835.679
being spied upon all the time forever

5833.679 --> 5838.56
everybody's gonna know everything about

5835.679 --> 5841.28
you if they really need to

5838.56 --> 5843.52
you understand there is

5841.28 --> 5846.32
no secrecy

5843.52 --> 5849.1990000000005
it doesn't exist anymore it's over it

5846.32 --> 5851.84
has been over for a while

5849.199 --> 5853.119
yeah just pray to god

5851.84 --> 5856.2390000000005
and

5853.119 --> 5857.199
try to ensure influence that they can't

5856.239 --> 5858.799999999999
just

5857.199 --> 5861.678999999999
use

5858.8 --> 5864.2390000000005
any type of spying information

5861.679 --> 5864.96
attained from illegally right

5864.239 --> 5866.638999999999
if

5864.96 --> 5868.719
they're that they're not actually gonna

5866.639 --> 5870.2390000000005
like present in court a recording that

5868.719 --> 5873.199
was made

5870.239 --> 5876.32
using a spy device in a washing machine

5873.199 --> 5881.199
if they illegalize that then we're all

5876.32 --> 5883.119
dead then if that happens it is 1984

5881.199 --> 5883.919999999999
and it's over then we're all going to

5883.119 --> 5887.44
die

5883.92 --> 5888.56
so make sure that's never ever legalized

5887.44 --> 5890.799999999999
ever

5888.56 --> 5893.1990000000005
but they are spying on you it is

5890.8 --> 5895.1990000000005
happening it will happen it cannot be

5893.199 --> 5897.759999999999
stopped the only way to stop it is to

5895.199 --> 5901.04
become amish and never get near an

5897.76 --> 5905.360000000001
electronic device ever again ever that's

5901.04 --> 5906.639
the only way to avoid that the only way

5905.36 --> 5908.5599999999995
you understand

5906.639 --> 5910.400000000001
cannot avoid it otherwise it's

5908.56 --> 5912.0
impossible

5910.4 --> 5915.599999999999
just make sure

5912.0 --> 5918.4
that they can't like legally use

5915.6 --> 5920.400000000001
spying devices because then it's all

5918.4 --> 5924.0
over

5920.4 --> 5926.32
it's all over if that happens

5924.0 --> 5930.8
right they're going to spy on you just

5926.32 --> 5930.799999999999
make sure they can't use it in court

5932.0 --> 5934.4
right

5932.88 --> 5936.639
because they've been spying through

5934.4 --> 5938.799999999999
phones and [ __ ] right this dude that's

5936.639 --> 5939.84
like halfway to 20th century they were

5938.8 --> 5942.320000000001
doing that

5939.84 --> 5945.4400000000005
spying through phones and all that right

5942.32 --> 5948.799999999999
guess what they can't use that in court

5945.44 --> 5951.599999999999
and it should stay that way

5948.8 --> 5954.2390000000005
illegally obtain information is not

5951.6 --> 5956.88
admissible in court and it should stay

5954.239 --> 5959.36
that way forever does it mean they're

5956.88 --> 5961.84
not gonna spy on you but it should just

5959.36 --> 5965.28
not be usable legally in court because

5961.84 --> 5966.639
if that becomes a possibility we're all

5965.28 --> 5970.759999999999
[ __ ]

5966.639 --> 5970.76
everybody will be [ __ ]

5982.4 --> 5986.239
can the controllers break all kinds of

5984.32 --> 5988.799999999999
encryption technology and some

5986.239 --> 5991.04
encryption methods no

5988.8 --> 5991.04
no

5992.0 --> 5995.84
encryption is a myth

5999.36 --> 6003.28
oh

6001.119 --> 6004.96
yeah sure it might work temporarily who

6003.28 --> 6006.8
holds the keys

6004.96 --> 6008.639
who's holding the keys do you know those

6006.8 --> 6010.56
people

6008.639 --> 6012.2390000000005
do you know them

6010.56 --> 6014.400000000001
i don't

6012.239 --> 6017.839999999999
oh they're saying oh it's so encrypted

6014.4 --> 6019.119
oh that's super cute you think

6017.84 --> 6020.56
i was like oh

6019.119 --> 6024.239
if it's so

6020.56 --> 6026.320000000001
super super encrypted and safe oh i

6024.239 --> 6029.759999999999
could just start talking about [ __ ] up

6026.32 --> 6032.239
[ __ ] again oh i could just know oh look

6029.76 --> 6034.4800000000005
child porn [ __ ] oh you think you can do

6032.239 --> 6036.638999999999
that yeah i'll guess what's gonna happen

6034.48 --> 6037.839999999999
guess what's gonna happen oh

6036.639 --> 6040.639
maybe it's

6037.84 --> 6042.4800000000005
not completely as encrypted as you

6040.639 --> 6044.639
thought it was me oh

6042.48 --> 6047.919999999999
why would that be could it be because

6044.639 --> 6050.56
encryption is a [ __ ] myth

6047.92 --> 6052.2390000000005
doesn't work anymore like it really

6050.56 --> 6054.2390000000005
doesn't oh it's going to take six

6052.239 --> 6056.0
million years for this computer to

6054.239 --> 6058.159
figure it out oh really

6056.0 --> 6060.8
well what if they updated that computer

6058.159 --> 6064.48
secretly like 50 years ago and it's like

6060.8 --> 6067.1990000000005
a hundred billion times faster

6064.48 --> 6068.799999999999
or it is like specifically designated to

6067.199 --> 6070.638999999999
instantaneously

6068.8 --> 6073.1990000000005
reverse engineer every form of

6070.639 --> 6075.28
encryption that could ever be conceived

6073.199 --> 6078.4
and nobody knows about it and it still

6075.28 --> 6081.679
exists oh it's so safe it says you don't

6078.4 --> 6084.0
know how [ __ ] safe it is

6081.679 --> 6088.52
all you got is some [ __ ] story to go

6084.0 --> 6088.52
by and that's all you got

6094.719 --> 6100.32
that makes no sense ai is not encryption

6097.44 --> 6101.678999999999
ai is a set of routines it's not an

6100.32 --> 6105.48
encryption you don't know what the hell

6101.679 --> 6105.4800000000005
you're talking about blackbird

6108.8 --> 6113.6
the head of the current tech

6111.679 --> 6117.119
yeah

6113.6 --> 6120.719
and guess what the current attack

6117.119 --> 6122.239
is catching up you understand

6120.719 --> 6126.4
the way to

6122.239 --> 6130.4
unravel encryption is catching up to

6126.4 --> 6130.4
crypt encryption you understand

6130.719 --> 6136.32
it already means that once it's stopped

6134.8 --> 6138.639
once they stop

6136.32 --> 6139.92
updating the encryption

6138.639 --> 6141.76
it's over

6139.92 --> 6143.92
it's just gone

6141.76 --> 6146.96
so encryption is always temporarily

6143.92 --> 6149.84
which means that everything will be

6146.96 --> 6153.199
known

6149.84 --> 6153.1990000000005
done it's over

6158.88 --> 6162.8
yeah by the way thank you ciao cat for

6161.119 --> 6165.28
the dog

6162.8 --> 6168.92
super chat donation i appreciate that

6165.28 --> 6168.92
welcome to the stream

6186.0 --> 6191.84
is the totals no blackbird you don't

6188.56 --> 6193.76
know what the [ __ ] you're talking about

6191.84 --> 6197.6
you don't know what artificial

6193.76 --> 6199.92
intelligence is i knew people in my life

6197.6 --> 6201.92
that designed those things

6199.92 --> 6204.8
specifically that

6201.92 --> 6207.4400000000005
multiple people yeah you don't seem to

6204.8 --> 6209.52
understand what artificial intelligence

6207.44 --> 6211.678999999999
is you think that if you put a bunch of

6209.52 --> 6214.8
data together it's certainly gonna

6211.679 --> 6217.52
form become alive you've been watching

6214.8 --> 6218.56
too many sci-fi movies

6217.52 --> 6221.76
yeah

6218.56 --> 6224.96
artificial intelligence is a routine

6221.76 --> 6226.639
system it's a network of decision-making

6224.96 --> 6228.88
algorithm

6226.639 --> 6231.119
that's what artificial intelligence is

6228.88 --> 6233.679
it's not you shop a bunch of data

6231.119 --> 6235.5199999999995
together and it becomes alive no you

6233.679 --> 6238.56
watch too many sci-fi

6235.52 --> 6238.56
doesn't work that way

6239.6 --> 6243.679
hey psych bear

6241.84 --> 6247.159000000001
yeah i'm gonna take a two minute break

6243.679 --> 6247.159
i'll be right back

6365.04 --> 6370.32
he doesn't understand electromagnetic

6368.239 --> 6372.0
world we live in we're a part of its

6370.32 --> 6376.32
dimensions

6372.0 --> 6376.32
dude you tripping balls man

6378.08 --> 6382.159
like that has nothing to do with

6380.0 --> 6384.08
artificial intelligence

6382.159 --> 6387.5199999999995
yeah when we're talking artificial

6384.08 --> 6389.28
intelligence you're talking electronics

6387.52 --> 6392.320000000001
that's what artificial intelligence

6389.28 --> 6394.239
really comes from

6392.32 --> 6395.759999999999
that has nothing to do with spirit

6394.239 --> 6398.08
mechanics

6395.76 --> 6401.280000000001
even though yeah it is mechanical in

6398.08 --> 6403.679
nature that was my conclusion

6401.28 --> 6406.639
right the spirit is like mechanical in

6403.679 --> 6407.76
nature it has a mechanism

6406.639 --> 6410.159000000001
right

6407.76 --> 6412.320000000001
but it has nothing to do like with the

6410.159 --> 6416.08
collective energy that's not what

6412.32 --> 6418.799999999999
artificial intelligence is involved in

6416.08 --> 6420.96
it's only decision making routine

6418.8 --> 6424.719
routines it's basically

6420.96 --> 6428.6
thought process emulation very carefully

6424.719 --> 6428.6
mapped out designed

6429.679 --> 6432.88
no you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

6431.119 --> 6436.0
talking about you're blabbering like a

6432.88 --> 6436.0
[ __ ] blackbird

6437.36 --> 6442.679
stay with it you're blabbering like a

6439.679 --> 6442.679
[ __ ]

6469.679 --> 6474.08
you are hinting to it no you're not

6471.84 --> 6475.84
listening to anything i'm saying i have

6474.08 --> 6477.5199999999995
listened to what you're saying you're

6475.84 --> 6480.159000000001
wrong

6477.52 --> 6482.400000000001
you don't understand how artificial

6480.159 --> 6485.5199999999995
intelligence has absolutely nothing to

6482.4 --> 6488.638999999999
do with the electromagnetic spirit

6485.52 --> 6491.040000000001
related activity of human beings

6488.639 --> 6494.0
has no relation to that

6491.04 --> 6495.92
you're mixing fields up

6494.0 --> 6497.6
because you're a fantasist that you

6495.92 --> 6499.84
don't actually know what you're talking

6497.6 --> 6499.84
about

6502.48 --> 6508.32
and i'm not going to come around

6505.52 --> 6510.88
because this is personal interest to me

6508.32 --> 6513.759999999999
to understand the difference to know

6510.88 --> 6516.96
what it is

6513.76 --> 6518.8
yeah i do spirit mechanics research

6516.96 --> 6522.639
for myself

6518.8 --> 6522.639
i lay it down all the time

6522.88 --> 6527.84
yeah artificial intelligence has nothing

6524.88 --> 6527.84
to do with it it's just

6527.92 --> 6531.76
system

6528.96 --> 6533.6
of decision making

6531.76 --> 6536.56
routines

6533.6 --> 6538.88
planned out by human beings

6536.56 --> 6541.280000000001
or derived from you human beings and

6538.88 --> 6543.119
assembled by machines

6541.28 --> 6544.88
doesn't matter it's all coming from

6543.119 --> 6546.799999999999
human beings all of it all those were

6544.88 --> 6549.52
teams there's no artificial intelligence

6546.8 --> 6550.719
that doesn't have a seed within human

6549.52 --> 6554.719
creation

6550.719 --> 6556.639
it doesn't exist zero zero percent

6554.719 --> 6558.8
because there would be no point to

6556.639 --> 6561.599
having artificial intelligence that

6558.8 --> 6565.04
isn't human in nature you see

6561.599 --> 6565.04
what the hell are we gonna do with that

6566.8 --> 6572.599
like there is no purpose for it to have

6569.119 --> 6572.598999999999
that existing

6586.56 --> 6589.360000000001
yeah

6587.84 --> 6592.08
now if you're

6589.36 --> 6594.48
trying to associate

6592.08 --> 6597.36
like oh the

6594.48 --> 6599.839999999999
i guess artificial intelligence or

6597.36 --> 6601.598999999999
something the demon spirit that takes

6599.84 --> 6603.1990000000005
over people that seems to function

6601.599 --> 6605.84
collectively

6603.199 --> 6609.36
yeah well guess what that has nothing to

6605.84 --> 6610.719
do with artificial intelligence

6609.36 --> 6613.44
that has to do

6610.719 --> 6616.56
with human

6613.44 --> 6617.44
internal programming

6616.56 --> 6619.679
and

6617.44 --> 6621.919999999999
a collective effect

6619.679 --> 6621.92
like

6622.239 --> 6627.5199999999995
fallback positions

6624.639 --> 6630.0
standard paths that are always available

6627.52 --> 6631.599
for you to fall back on and lose your

6630.0 --> 6634.08
consciousness and grip on the moment

6631.599 --> 6635.679
while you do it so you automated

6634.08 --> 6638.48
responses right

6635.679 --> 6640.32
it seems very programmed and like oh why

6638.48 --> 6642.879999999999
does everybody respond the same way like

6640.32 --> 6645.44
it's one single intelligence it isn't

6642.88 --> 6647.92
it's a collective effect

6645.44 --> 6650.08
it's a collective frequency and if you

6647.92 --> 6650.96
tune into that frequency you're going to

6650.08 --> 6655.599
act

6650.96 --> 6655.599
the same because of the frequency

6657.119 --> 6660.88
that's how it works has nothing to do

6658.8 --> 6663.04
with pre-programming or something

6660.88 --> 6664.719
computer-like

6663.04 --> 6669.04
right we have to understand that

6664.719 --> 6672.159
computers are created by man

6669.04 --> 6674.159
so if humans suddenly have this weird

6672.159 --> 6676.638999999999
resemblance to like computer-like

6674.159 --> 6678.5599999999995
behavior maybe to your intuition your

6676.639 --> 6680.400000000001
feeling when you size them up

6678.56 --> 6683.76
you know why that is it's not because

6680.4 --> 6687.36
they're always secretly or a computer or

6683.76 --> 6689.1990000000005
no it's because computers were made by

6687.36 --> 6692.96
man

6689.199 --> 6694.48
that computer-like thing that that feel

6692.96 --> 6699.119
to it

6694.48 --> 6703.04
is created from man it was in man

6699.119 --> 6705.839999999999
always before it manifested within

6703.04 --> 6708.08
computers you understand

6705.84 --> 6709.84
so it's the other way around it's not oh

6708.08 --> 6711.76
there's a computer in that person he's

6709.84 --> 6715.04
got control of him no

6711.76 --> 6718.56
that's a thing that humans have in them

6715.04 --> 6720.84
and that was also manifested within

6718.56 --> 6722.639
computers because of their structural

6720.84 --> 6725.679
systems

6722.639 --> 6726.56
right it's the structure that does that

6725.679 --> 6729.4400000000005
that's

6726.56 --> 6729.4400000000005
what it really is

6731.36 --> 6737.839999999999
computers are like humans humans are not

6733.84 --> 6737.84
like computers it's the other way around

6741.6 --> 6744.829000000001
[Music]

6746.88 --> 6751.599
using brain cells on chips

6749.599 --> 6754.639
is that evil

6751.599 --> 6754.639
i don't know why not

6754.96 --> 6760.719
they want us to integrate all these

6756.719 --> 6762.84
stupid ais sorry bjc that's stupid there

6760.719 --> 6766.4800000000005
is nothing

6762.84 --> 6769.360000000001
there integrate with a.i that there is

6766.48 --> 6770.799999999999
no such thing ai is just a bunch of

6769.36 --> 6773.5199999999995
routines

6770.8 --> 6775.4400000000005
you can't integrate with it

6773.52 --> 6777.76
you can deal with it

6775.44 --> 6781.04
it's not going to you're not going to be

6777.76 --> 6782.96
a part of that

6781.04 --> 6784.8
the only thing that would potentially

6782.96 --> 6787.199
happen like that

6784.8 --> 6789.4400000000005
is that it will just get invasive and

6787.199 --> 6791.678999999999
try to manipulate you

6789.44 --> 6794.799999999999
like a pavlovian dog

6791.679 --> 6798.08
right that's like what could happen

6794.8 --> 6798.08
it's gonna meddle with you

6798.4 --> 6803.598999999999
if it was designed to do that

6800.88 --> 6806.8
right there that this fantasy oh

6803.599 --> 6809.1990000000005
ooh our spirit is certainly gonna become

6806.8 --> 6811.28
dead you know and then we become one

6809.199 --> 6815.5199999999995
with this elusive

6811.28 --> 6818.08
god it's all garbage [ __ ] sci-fi

6815.52 --> 6820.56
talk people that say that don't know

6818.08 --> 6824.239
what the [ __ ] they're talking about it's

6820.56 --> 6827.679
all dreams it's all sci-fi

6824.239 --> 6827.678999999999
it doesn't mean anything

6828.48 --> 6833.159
it really doesn't it's a myth

6843.28 --> 6846.8
right

6844.239 --> 6849.44
and yeah using

6846.8 --> 6853.119000000001
biotechnology

6849.44 --> 6855.759999999999
yeah biotechnology brains that function

6853.119 --> 6857.598999999999
as computer chips

6855.76 --> 6859.679
that's not new guys

6857.599 --> 6862.4800000000005
star trek voyager

6859.679 --> 6864.4
had that standardized had a whole item

6862.48 --> 6866.799999999999
about it

6864.4 --> 6868.879999999999
special packs that were effectively

6866.8 --> 6871.92
genetically engineered brain

6868.88 --> 6874.96
specifically designed to be

6871.92 --> 6877.92
super heavy computer database banks

6874.96 --> 6879.679
calculator processors right

6877.92 --> 6881.599
it's gonna happen

6879.679 --> 6883.92
right it's one of the few things where

6881.599 --> 6886.08
i'm gonna say like yeah that's not a bad

6883.92 --> 6888.159
idea actually

6886.08 --> 6890.88
yeah it's freaky

6888.159 --> 6892.638999999999
it doesn't mean oh that means they're

6890.88 --> 6895.4400000000005
going to stick a

6892.639 --> 6899.04
on your head and now you're possessed by

6895.44 --> 6901.5199999999995
the ai like get the [ __ ] over yourself

6899.04 --> 6905.5199999999995
with your stupid [ __ ] fantasy

6901.52 --> 6910.320000000001
[ __ ] stop it stop doing that

6905.52 --> 6913.599
it's not real that's not real

6910.32 --> 6915.92
biology however being designed

6913.599 --> 6919.119000000001
redesigned and exploited for

6915.92 --> 6921.36
technological purposes yeah that could

6919.119 --> 6923.759999999999
be real it's already

6921.36 --> 6925.679
in indirect ways happening that like

6923.76 --> 6928.2390000000005
yeah you can literally like take stem

6925.679 --> 6930.88
cells and like grow an organ out of it

6928.239 --> 6933.04
from your own cells right if you can do

6930.88 --> 6935.52
that and that's kind of okay i guess

6933.04 --> 6937.84
right oh it is still very freaking

6935.52 --> 6940.080000000001
evasive

6937.84 --> 6941.679
it is testing god

6940.08 --> 6946.4
but it's like yeah it's not too bad

6941.679 --> 6949.4400000000005
right well what's why not then

6946.4 --> 6953.199
a brain that could literally just live

6949.44 --> 6953.199
in a box for like 20 years

6953.44 --> 6957.5199999999995
you have to put some supplements or

6955.52 --> 6959.679
whatever in there special packages you

6957.52 --> 6961.92
just click it on there whatever

6959.679 --> 6964.2390000000005
a feeds is like fully enclosed system

6961.92 --> 6965.52
that's just like a super super smart

6964.239 --> 6968.239
computer

6965.52 --> 6970.88
smart really extremely fast with no

6968.239 --> 6972.959999999999
sentience whatsoever

6970.88 --> 6975.52
is not living it's literally just

6972.96 --> 6978.719
biomatter being used like a computer

6975.52 --> 6978.719
like what's the problem

6979.599 --> 6984.2390000000005
there is no sentience involved

6982.0 --> 6986.159
there's no consciousness involved it's

6984.239 --> 6989.48
the exploitation of organic matter

6986.159 --> 6989.48
that's it

6989.76 --> 6994.2390000000005
is that ethical well that's

6991.76 --> 6996.639
yeah you could like debate about that on

6994.239 --> 6997.919999999999
some supposed right or left wing

6996.639 --> 6999.84
position

6997.92 --> 7001.679
oh you like you can spend half your

6999.84 --> 7005.04
lifetime debating that yeah is that

7001.679 --> 7007.76
gonna stop it no

7005.04 --> 7007.76
no it's not

7011.599 --> 7014.599
right

7017.199 --> 7023.839999999999
the sky that's oh my god

7020.719 --> 7026.0
i'm just so done with all that doom

7023.84 --> 7027.84
[ __ ] from people that literally

7026.0 --> 7030.48
don't know what the hell they're talking

7027.84 --> 7032.56
about it's just oh they heard some

7030.48 --> 7034.259999999999
conspiracy theories oh

7032.56 --> 7035.599
it's gonna happen

7034.26 --> 7037.52
[Music]

7035.599 --> 7039.92
why

7037.52 --> 7042.4800000000005
why do you repeat that why do you let

7039.92 --> 7045.1990000000005
that get in you and then oh it's so

7042.48 --> 7047.678999999999
doomed like why do you let yourself get

7045.199 --> 7050.719
enchanted like that it's [ __ ] why

7047.679 --> 7054.08
did you think about it carefully

7050.719 --> 7056.4
actually think about it not just oh

7054.08 --> 7058.48
think back to when that time happened

7056.4 --> 7061.28
when it was all hyped up and i felt like

7058.48 --> 7063.199
it too no actually what is it talking

7061.28 --> 7065.44
about what is there described is that

7063.199 --> 7067.36
actually based on any form of reality

7065.44 --> 7069.119
whatsoever

7067.36 --> 7070.799999999999
why don't you think about that why don't

7069.119 --> 7073.28
you actually figure out what you're

7070.8 --> 7076.159000000001
saying before you start blabbering it

7073.28 --> 7076.159
over the internet

7080.48 --> 7083.839999999999
they can upload your consciousness into

7082.48 --> 7085.759999999999
a chucky doll

7083.84 --> 7088.2390000000005
that's right

7085.76 --> 7090.320000000001
that's just part of the myth it's just

7088.239 --> 7093.718999999999
part of the myth

7090.32 --> 7093.719
it's a myth

7100.32 --> 7103.599
it's all part of the myth

7108.48 --> 7113.799999999999
hello rick back by the way happy sunday

7110.639 --> 7113.8
to you

7126.48 --> 7132.159
have a person who've written the coding

7129.679 --> 7134.32
make a person be influenced into doing

7132.159 --> 7136.719
things they would normally

7134.32 --> 7137.599
right or social engineering influences

7136.719 --> 7140.719
right

7137.599 --> 7143.84
but is technology like mechanically

7140.719 --> 7147.28
forcing you to do that or is simply a

7143.84 --> 7149.599
suggestion woven into the soup of media

7147.28 --> 7152.4
that you're typically exposed to

7149.599 --> 7154.2390000000005
and that way the suggestion is planted

7152.4 --> 7158.719
and then integrated with your

7154.239 --> 7160.0
subconscious automated learning program

7158.719 --> 7163.04
right

7160.0 --> 7165.76
all this idea of like oh a computer or a

7163.04 --> 7168.4
robot is coming for you and then

7165.76 --> 7169.599
you're a computer now like oh come on

7168.4 --> 7171.839999999999
man

7169.599 --> 7175.119000000001
it they don't even need to go that far

7171.84 --> 7177.92
they just weave in a suggestion in the

7175.119 --> 7180.719
media that you consume

7177.92 --> 7182.4
and then it will plant itself and you

7180.719 --> 7183.76
will just think like oh yeah that's a

7182.4 --> 7185.5199999999995
pretty good idea

7183.76 --> 7188.400000000001
that's how they do it

7185.52 --> 7191.84
they don't need to invasively force

7188.4 --> 7195.28
anything they just plant a suggestion in

7191.84 --> 7198.159000000001
the media you consume done it's done

7195.28 --> 7200.159
people are so used to it already that

7198.159 --> 7202.32
they literally like please program me

7200.159 --> 7204.32
please program me what am i supposed to

7202.32 --> 7206.32
do next

7204.32 --> 7209.199
yeah

7206.32 --> 7211.759999999999
like that's how people get programmed

7209.199 --> 7214.0
not by some sci-fi

7211.76 --> 7216.639
horror movie of

7214.0 --> 7219.599
a computer penetrating your brain and

7216.639 --> 7222.400000000001
possessing you come on man

7219.599 --> 7225.84
they already got you all they do

7222.4 --> 7228.32
is plant a suggestion in media then you

7225.84 --> 7231.599
unwittingly consume it

7228.32 --> 7234.0
and let it program you

7231.599 --> 7238.08
all that sci-fi

7234.0 --> 7240.0
horror garbage it's all just distraction

7238.08 --> 7242.0
from the fact that they're already doing

7240.0 --> 7244.0
it they're already doing that they don't

7242.0 --> 7246.48
even need to be that terrible and

7244.0 --> 7248.96
invasive they just feed you through

7246.48 --> 7254.04
media the suggestion that they want you

7248.96 --> 7254.04
to assimilate there you go done

7262.159 --> 7268.28
doing a three shot our shows from now on

7265.28 --> 7268.28
no

7270.719 --> 7274.719
no it's just two hours

7272.88 --> 7276.719
this like i almost

7274.719 --> 7278.719
got to the two hour mark and yesterday

7276.719 --> 7279.679
yeah yesterday was an unusually long

7278.719 --> 7283.0
show

7279.679 --> 7283.0
that's true

7313.639 --> 7317.36
spasmopoliton

7315.599 --> 7318.719
that's a weird

7317.36 --> 7321.96
word

7318.719 --> 7321.96
to create

7350.88 --> 7356.56
yep that's right matthew you got it you

7353.36 --> 7356.5599999999995
got it totally

7358.0 --> 7362.4
we are here we always look

7360.159 --> 7364.638999999999
for more options for a situation where

7362.4 --> 7368.08
lots of people get close-minded

7364.639 --> 7370.8
and tunnel in on the options they

7368.08 --> 7373.04
there or rather they were presented with

7370.8 --> 7375.52
and won't consider anything else right

7373.04 --> 7377.5199999999995
they took a piece of information

7375.52 --> 7379.599
it was good enough for them

7377.52 --> 7381.679
and then they closed off for new

7379.599 --> 7383.599
information and so they don't update and

7381.679 --> 7386.08
then they're stuck with the program of

7383.599 --> 7389.76
that idea even though it was

7386.08 --> 7391.04
incomplete or complete hogwash

7389.76 --> 7393.76
really

7391.04 --> 7395.84
it's what people do it's because

7393.76 --> 7398.320000000001
too much information there's too much

7395.84 --> 7399.599
information in general around for people

7398.32 --> 7401.679
to handle

7399.599 --> 7405.360000000001
they want some information they don't

7401.679 --> 7407.36
want all of it right that's the problem

7405.36 --> 7410.159
people want some information they don't

7407.36 --> 7413.839999999999
want all of it but in the choice that

7410.159 --> 7416.719
rolls out of that want out of that need

7413.84 --> 7419.04
they often settle for incomplete

7416.719 --> 7420.56
information

7419.04 --> 7421.5199999999995
and that's a problem

7420.56 --> 7424.159000000001
because

7421.52 --> 7426.2390000000005
it's like you can't really afford to do

7424.159 --> 7428.879999999999
that anymore like if it were like 200

7426.239 --> 7430.4
years ago that would work great it would

7428.88 --> 7432.719
work great right because it would have

7430.4 --> 7434.159
only been said one time some impressive

7432.719 --> 7435.84
speech or

7434.159 --> 7437.679
whatever and then you remember it and

7435.84 --> 7439.119000000001
then you hold on to it and you will hold

7437.679 --> 7440.8
on to it the rest of your life and it

7439.119 --> 7442.88
would be epic and you would have that

7440.8 --> 7444.56
memory forever it would be great right

7442.88 --> 7446.56
right now

7444.56 --> 7448.639
there's so much [ __ ] constantly

7446.56 --> 7451.280000000001
happening it doesn't work that

7448.639 --> 7453.28
effectively anymore

7451.28 --> 7455.84
this the internet is too much

7453.28 --> 7459.199
information to just take one thing and

7455.84 --> 7462.400000000001
hold on to it forever

7459.199 --> 7464.5599999999995
like an isolated incident

7462.4 --> 7467.119
that doesn't work anymore

7464.56 --> 7469.679
it's too much information to do that now

7467.119 --> 7471.839999999999
it'll just prevent you from learning

7469.679 --> 7473.92
more if you do that now

7471.84 --> 7476.32
200 years ago it would have been the

7473.92 --> 7477.4400000000005
best thing to do ever if you were

7476.32 --> 7479.759999999999
something

7477.44 --> 7481.5199999999995
somewhere really prominent and like a

7479.76 --> 7484.4800000000005
great speech or something really

7481.52 --> 7486.719
interesting yeah you do that yeah

7484.48 --> 7488.799999999999
well that sort of [ __ ] it's now

7486.719 --> 7491.52
information things happening all the

7488.8 --> 7493.679
time a lot that's being learned really

7491.52 --> 7495.040000000001
deep research there there there there

7493.679 --> 7497.92
there there

7495.04 --> 7500.239
you can't just take one thing hold on to

7497.92 --> 7502.56
it and then ignore everything else it

7500.239 --> 7504.959999999999
doesn't work anymore

7502.56 --> 7509.52
things are going too fast for that to

7504.96 --> 7509.52
work you'll just be stuck

7518.239 --> 7522.239
do you think to essentially uploaded

7520.639 --> 7525.36
your thoughts and consciousness in

7522.239 --> 7527.5199999999995
youtube in the form of eb shows

7525.36 --> 7529.119
i certainly hope so

7527.52 --> 7531.679
i mean

7529.119 --> 7534.719
i'm intending this to be

7531.679 --> 7536.4800000000005
everything i do is a psychological study

7534.719 --> 7539.36
on me

7536.48 --> 7542.48
and it is a study on the very high

7539.36 --> 7545.28
frequency mechanical thinking in itself

7542.48 --> 7547.839999999999
it's a human study

7545.28 --> 7550.079
now they can't capture

7547.84 --> 7552.400000000001
as in take away

7550.079 --> 7554.88
my consciousness because i'm still here

7552.4 --> 7557.199
it's just a record it's just like a book

7554.88 --> 7559.599
right a book that's written by an

7557.199 --> 7561.678999999999
individual that's very inspired

7559.599 --> 7564.079
is

7561.679 --> 7566.4800000000005
their consciousness being captured in

7564.079 --> 7568.719
that moment translated

7566.48 --> 7570.0
and then stuck to that moment for the

7568.719 --> 7572.079
rest

7570.0 --> 7574.159
of existence right

7572.079 --> 7576.799999999999
in that sense yes

7574.159 --> 7579.759999999999
i see doing these shows like a giant

7576.8 --> 7583.599
book it's like a giant journal

7579.76 --> 7583.599
it's very serious project to me

7586.719 --> 7595.84
but they can't capture it

7590.56 --> 7598.159000000001
because i'm it and they can't capture me

7595.84 --> 7599.92
even though i'm recording it

7598.159 --> 7603.28
they can't

7599.92 --> 7606.56
take away what i am and then replace it

7603.28 --> 7608.32
with the youtube thing because i'm in

7606.56 --> 7612.2390000000005
control of that

7608.32 --> 7615.92
it's me if i'd stop then it would stop

7612.239 --> 7615.919999999999
but it would have always been me

7616.159 --> 7621.04
it's not going to continue without me i

7618.719 --> 7622.88
mean people might look back upon it

7621.04 --> 7624.8
learn a whole bunch of things and then

7622.88 --> 7627.28
they might get something out of that

7624.8 --> 7629.360000000001
even though it is

7627.28 --> 7632.0
in the past then

7629.36 --> 7634.5599999999995
it doesn't matter

7632.0 --> 7636.4
can't capture somebody's soul

7634.56 --> 7637.4400000000005
they can only

7636.4 --> 7640.44
give it

7637.44 --> 7640.44
away

7660.0 --> 7663.36
oh okay they know that's

7663.76 --> 7666.159000000001
sounds

7666.96 --> 7671.119
a bit sad when you say it like that when

7669.52 --> 7673.119000000001
i look back upon your life it's with the

7671.119 --> 7675.36
sense of shame i've always been the way

7673.119 --> 7677.28
to blame well is it shame though it

7675.36 --> 7679.598999999999
should at first sure if you want to be

7677.28 --> 7682.48
honest at first yeah shame

7679.599 --> 7684.56
but then realized like

7682.48 --> 7687.199
yeah but you were basically there to

7684.56 --> 7689.119000000001
learn from it so did you learn did you

7687.199 --> 7691.199
outgrow those things you're ashamed

7689.119 --> 7693.36
about because then you don't necessarily

7691.199 --> 7696.0
need to be ashamed about them anymore

7693.36 --> 7698.799999999999
because you've actually overcome them

7696.0 --> 7700.56
only real purpose of shame is to face

7698.8 --> 7703.04
you with the things that you haven't

7700.56 --> 7706.320000000001
overcome

7703.04 --> 7708.4
that's where shame becomes logical

7706.32 --> 7710.48
if you actually overcame it yeah you

7708.4 --> 7713.44
were weaker but you grew out of it why

7710.48 --> 7717.48
would you be ashamed of that

7713.44 --> 7717.48
it worked out right

7721.36 --> 7726.48
in a room with no windows in the corner

7723.76 --> 7730.119000000001
oh that sounds like prison

7726.48 --> 7730.119
they know hmm

7737.84 --> 7742.719
if you ask god's forgiveness and forgive

7740.239 --> 7744.959999999999
yourself for mistakes no

7742.719 --> 7745.92
i disagree

7744.96 --> 7747.92
that's

7745.92 --> 7751.04
internal personal reflection sure you

7747.92 --> 7752.0
could do that but the only way to atone

7751.04 --> 7753.119
really

7752.0 --> 7756.239
is to

7753.119 --> 7759.839999999999
fundamentally learn from the mistake and

7756.239 --> 7762.799999999999
let that knowledge that you have learn

7759.84 --> 7765.599
change you for the better

7762.8 --> 7768.2390000000005
that's the real redemption that's when

7765.599 --> 7770.4800000000005
god truly forgives you and even blesses

7768.239 --> 7773.48
you

7770.48 --> 7773.48
right

7774.0 --> 7778.0
if you just get stuck in the shame

7778.239 --> 7782.638999999999
then you're not doing anything with it

7780.239 --> 7785.36
then you're not you're gonna end up just

7782.639 --> 7789.92
feeling bad and then avoiding it again

7785.36 --> 7793.04
right why don't you resolve the shame

7789.92 --> 7795.52
overcome the obstacle prove to yourself

7793.04 --> 7797.599
that you have learned from it let that

7795.52 --> 7798.56
knowledge be tested

7797.599 --> 7800.88
and then

7798.56 --> 7803.52
you can be proud

7800.88 --> 7805.599
where once you were ashamed of it now

7803.52 --> 7807.1990000000005
you can be proud because you can prove

7805.599 --> 7809.76
you overcame it

7807.199 --> 7813.48
that you're better than who you were

7809.76 --> 7813.4800000000005
when you made the mistake

7815.04 --> 7817.36
see

7818.079 --> 7823.599
shame is

7820.239 --> 7826.079
another utility it's a tool it's an

7823.599 --> 7829.4800000000005
element in there and it has purposes it

7826.079 --> 7829.48
has a function

7831.04 --> 7837.5199999999995
it's all part of just the godly system

7835.119 --> 7840.4
the design it's all part of it

7837.52 --> 7842.400000000001
all of it every form of sensation

7840.4 --> 7846.32
you just gotta figure out

7842.4 --> 7846.32
what its place is

7846.639 --> 7852.079
don't erase any trait

7849.04 --> 7854.8
find the proper place for it

7852.079 --> 7857.679
in in the spectrum of reality find the

7854.8 --> 7860.719
proper place for it

7857.679 --> 7862.96
like find out what that impulse means

7860.719 --> 7865.36
why do you have it

7862.96 --> 7868.159
what is it doing

7865.36 --> 7871.839999999999
why do you like it

7868.159 --> 7871.839999999999
understand what you're doing

7873.18 --> 7876.259
[Music]

7890.32 --> 7895.679
asking god to forgive is helpful

7893.199 --> 7899.28
well it yeah it can be especially if

7895.679 --> 7901.04
you're like stuck in a obsessive mindset

7899.28 --> 7903.5199999999995
like if you can't let it go if you

7901.04 --> 7905.599
notice like you're too proud you're too

7903.52 --> 7906.4800000000005
enjoying

7905.599 --> 7908.159000000001
it

7906.48 --> 7909.44
even though it's crumbling around you

7908.159 --> 7912.159
then

7909.44 --> 7914.5599999999995
like turning to god and be like please

7912.159 --> 7916.799999999999
i'm doing this wrong but i can't let go

7914.56 --> 7917.679
can you help me right that to me would

7916.8 --> 7921.679
be

7917.679 --> 7923.599
a good moment to approach god

7921.679 --> 7925.92
but if it's like already if you're

7923.599 --> 7927.92
already out of the mistake phase like

7925.92 --> 7929.679
that the actual action and the wrong

7927.92 --> 7931.36
mindset

7929.679 --> 7933.92
and you're just trying to think back on

7931.36 --> 7935.679
it like oh man i did it so wrong

7933.92 --> 7939.1990000000005
well you don't necessarily have to be

7935.679 --> 7941.84
ashamed about it if you understand why

7939.199 --> 7941.839999999999
it was wrong

7942.4 --> 7947.759999999999
and you learn how to deal with it if it

7945.119 --> 7947.759999999999
comes back

7948.239 --> 7953.119
and then instead of being ashamed you

7950.239 --> 7956.638999999999
can be proud that you faced

7953.119 --> 7959.5199999999995
a mistake and that you overcame it

7956.639 --> 7960.88
and that you're more now that you turned

7959.52 --> 7964.159000000001
the mistake

7960.88 --> 7967.88
into a utility for yourself you become

7964.159 --> 7967.879999999999
more because of it

7970.88 --> 7974.4800000000005
does it become nearly impossible to

7972.639 --> 7977.1990000000005
change certain bad habits the other we

7974.48 --> 7977.199
get yes

7977.28 --> 7982.159
right but bad habits have a function too

7980.159 --> 7984.48
right they're like the sin factor

7982.159 --> 7986.239
they're the one the things that pull you

7984.48 --> 7988.638999999999
out of whack a bit

7986.239 --> 7990.0
if you do that especially when you get

7988.639 --> 7992.400000000001
older and older

7990.0 --> 7994.4
well it has a place that means that the

7992.4 --> 7997.839999999999
older you get the less you will be able

7994.4 --> 7997.839999999999
to live without it

7998.079 --> 8002.239
right

7999.92 --> 8005.04
because every type of behavior has a

8002.239 --> 8006.5599999999995
function within a person usually to deal

8005.04 --> 8011.0
with energy whether they're conscious

8006.56 --> 8011.0
about it or not that's how it works

8011.04 --> 8016.32
and yeah if you grow into habits

8014.56 --> 8017.84
that aren't necessarily good and you get

8016.32 --> 8020.48
older and you're still holding on to

8017.84 --> 8021.84
that yeah then it will become almost

8020.48 --> 8023.759999999999
impossible

8021.84 --> 8025.599
to get it out because the punishment

8023.76 --> 8027.1990000000005
would become too high right because

8025.599 --> 8028.96
you're getting older

8027.199 --> 8031.919999999999
you're still gonna have

8028.96 --> 8034.4
bodily burdens

8031.92 --> 8035.92
right it becomes tougher

8034.4 --> 8038.5599999999995
to manage

8035.92 --> 8040.8
often when you get all there

8038.56 --> 8043.92
and then changing a habit can have like

8040.8 --> 8045.84
a very heavy demoralizing impact on you

8043.92 --> 8049.2390000000005
that you can't handle anymore because

8045.84 --> 8049.2390000000005
you're like old

8058.159 --> 8064.04
not just in trouble time dude what are

8060.0 --> 8064.04
you talking about borders boy

8066.8 --> 8073.119000000001
like i have like everything i do i do in

8070.56 --> 8076.0
the shadow of the lord

8073.119 --> 8079.44
okay everything i do it's literally

8076.0 --> 8082.159
there like i literally concede

8079.44 --> 8086.239
all information i get everything is

8082.159 --> 8086.239
because of god it's directly from him

8087.04 --> 8093.719
i'm sorry

8089.36 --> 8093.719
it's not just in trouble times

8096.32 --> 8098.88
right but

8099.44 --> 8103.839999999999
if you're just euphoric and like oh i

8102.0 --> 8106.48
love it so much it's like yeah that's

8103.84 --> 8108.0
cool but like what does god really do

8106.48 --> 8109.598999999999
with that you think he'd get something

8108.0 --> 8112.4
out of that

8109.599 --> 8116.159000000001
now god wants learn wants development

8112.4 --> 8116.159
wants evolution of the spirit

8117.04 --> 8123.04
that's what really makes him happy

8120.639 --> 8125.04
this ascending the spiritual letter like

8123.04 --> 8127.76
jesus christ that's what makes him

8125.04 --> 8127.76
really happy

8132.8 --> 8137.1990000000005
it's an observation yeah i get that but

8135.36 --> 8139.759999999999
what's the problem with that borders boy

8137.199 --> 8141.199
i don't see the trouble oh

8139.76 --> 8145.52
how dare you

8141.199 --> 8147.44
not think of god when you're happy

8145.52 --> 8149.280000000001
i mean okay if you're going to be like

8147.44 --> 8152.159
guys it's a piece of [ __ ]

8149.28 --> 8154.079
i'm if humans are the real god

8152.159 --> 8155.759999999999
and then you get like in a terrible

8154.079 --> 8157.44
terrible situation like oh please god

8155.76 --> 8159.52
forgive you all

8157.44 --> 8162.079
yeah that's super annoying and it's

8159.52 --> 8165.119000000001
really not genuine right

8162.079 --> 8167.36
but just because a god person would only

8165.119 --> 8169.5199999999995
address god typically when they're like

8167.36 --> 8171.44
really desperate does it mean that oh

8169.52 --> 8172.719
how dare you only do that when you're

8171.44 --> 8176.839999999999
desperate

8172.719 --> 8179.92
as long as they can actually respect

8176.84 --> 8181.92
god when they're doing good

8179.92 --> 8184.56
then what's the problem why would you

8181.92 --> 8189.32
have to invoke god every time you feel

8184.56 --> 8189.320000000001
happy i don't see the point of that

8192.08 --> 8195.92
while when you're in a terrible

8193.76 --> 8197.679
predicament that's exactly when you

8195.92 --> 8199.519
should invoke him because that's what

8197.679 --> 8202.639
people do naturally and it's when it

8199.519 --> 8206.84
happens when it helps

8202.639 --> 8206.839999999998
so i don't see the problem

8227.04 --> 8231.12
i guess your dreams always end what

8232.24 --> 8237.84
they don't rise up just is that are you

8234.24 --> 8237.84
trying to be poetic there

8245.76 --> 8251.0
yeah it seems like you're trying to make

8247.519 --> 8251.0
a poem there

8262.479 --> 8267.76
thankful for but i am thankful for this

8265.12 --> 8270.0
boy why do why would you say that i am

8267.76 --> 8270.0
not

8270.24 --> 8274.84
why would you suggest that

8272.24 --> 8278.96
sort of indirectly

8274.84 --> 8278.960000000001
dude do i not

8279.04 --> 8282.639000000001
like

8280.08 --> 8285.039999999999
testify to the glory of god when i feel

8282.639 --> 8287.759999999998
strong do i not do that

8285.04 --> 8290.160000000002
do i draw everything it's just me

8287.76 --> 8293.519
it made me special way

8290.16 --> 8295.28
do i ever do that no i don't do that i

8293.519 --> 8298.0
don't get it

8295.28 --> 8300.24
i don't see the problem here

8298.0 --> 8302.399
it's natural when you're in a terrible

8300.24 --> 8304.88
predicament that you're like i'm not in

8302.399 --> 8307.358999999999
control god please help me that's

8304.88 --> 8309.92
natural

8307.359 --> 8312.399000000001
i don't understand why that would like

8309.92 --> 8314.479
oh you only do it when you're desperate

8312.399 --> 8316.319
what's the problem here

8314.479 --> 8318.719
unless when you're good you're an

8316.319 --> 8320.319
arrogant bastard that's a different

8318.719 --> 8322.399
thing then it's about you being an

8320.319 --> 8324.24
arrogant bastard

8322.399 --> 8326.399
when you're good

8324.24 --> 8328.399
that's the problem not that they oh why

8326.399 --> 8330.96
aren't you invoking god or anything when

8328.399 --> 8331.76
you feel good that's not a problem it's

8330.96 --> 8333.279999999999
just

8331.76 --> 8335.92
when they're good

8333.28 --> 8337.28
are they still respectful or do they get

8335.92 --> 8339.92
arrogant

8337.28 --> 8342.319000000001
because that's the problem not that they

8339.92 --> 8344.639
don't invoke god if that they behave

8342.319 --> 8347.84
terribly when they're doing good that's

8344.639 --> 8347.839999999998
the problem

8358.639 --> 8363.88
i've seen a lot of people at their

8359.92 --> 8363.88
lowest point yeah me too

8374.319 --> 8378.16
right yeah

8376.08 --> 8380.08
psych bear a lot of people think they're

8378.16 --> 8383.359
unworthy for forgiveness or redemption

8380.08 --> 8386.479
so they become self-destructive yeah

8383.359 --> 8386.479000000001
that's what happened to me

8387.439 --> 8390.720000000001
i didn't feel worthy

8390.88 --> 8397.358999999999
like all my senses showed me how

8394.24 --> 8400.16
incredibly not in control and imperfect

8397.359 --> 8402.640000000001
i was at a very young age and then i

8400.16 --> 8405.68
just thought like i'm

8402.64 --> 8407.92
i don't deserve

8405.68 --> 8407.92
it

8409.68 --> 8413.2
that's what happened to me it's

8414.16 --> 8421.28
very disruptive to have that

8418.56 --> 8423.439
but i grew out of it but i had to fight

8421.28 --> 8425.6
to grow out of it right

8423.439 --> 8427.84
you could almost say that like parts of

8425.6 --> 8432.0
rage win are

8427.84 --> 8433.92
necessary for me to stay out of that

8432.0 --> 8436.24
idea

8433.92 --> 8439.52
that i'm not worthy right i do it to

8436.24 --> 8441.76
defend myself against

8439.52 --> 8441.76
like

8441.84 --> 8445.84
introspective hopelessness

8446.24 --> 8451.439
that's part of the reason why i

8449.359 --> 8453.439
indulge into

8451.439 --> 8456.24
that sort of expression

8453.439 --> 8458.319
why i allow myself to do that

8456.24 --> 8460.319
it's directly to counter the

8458.319 --> 8464.08
introspective effect that led me to

8460.319 --> 8464.08
becoming very self-destructive

8464.399 --> 8468.08
because i haven't always been this

8466.24 --> 8470.96
expressive

8468.08 --> 8472.56
fragmented i was that i have been this

8470.96 --> 8474.319
expressive but then people like

8472.56 --> 8475.119999999999
face-to-face situation would immediately

8474.319 --> 8477.279999999999
like

8475.12 --> 8479.6
be like this is outrageous

8477.28 --> 8482.319000000001
how dare you

8479.6 --> 8484.56
so i didn't really do that a lot

8482.319 --> 8487.439
now with the internet and a youtube

8484.56 --> 8490.16
channel there's all this room to

8487.439 --> 8492.960000000001
actually manifest it now

8490.16 --> 8494.16
and i have it under control

8492.96 --> 8496.72
there's nobody

8494.16 --> 8499.72
barging in and telling me shut the [ __ ]

8496.72 --> 8499.72
up

8500.56 --> 8505.119999999999
that there's nobody i need to fear

8502.399 --> 8507.599999999999
anymore i feared people

8505.12 --> 8511.0
that would try to stop me from doing

8507.6 --> 8511.0
what i do

8541.84 --> 8545.28
that's right some really do have to go

8543.76 --> 8548.28
through the fire to find him that's

8545.28 --> 8548.28
right

8563.84 --> 8567.84
wow anyway

8566.0 --> 8570.319
i've been going for two hours and 20

8567.84 --> 8573.12
minutes i think i'm rounding out it's

8570.319 --> 8573.119999999999
been great though

8578.8 --> 8585.0
unless you had some thin finishing

8581.04 --> 8585.0
thoughts or ideas

8585.68 --> 8588.68
guys

8605.6 --> 8609.52
hey my friends i know jesus

8610.96 --> 8616.56
okay that sucks they know

8614.319 --> 8619.039999999999
sanji were hanging in really terrible

8616.56 --> 8619.039999999999
circles

8620.319 --> 8624.56
don't forget that duck you yeah yeah

8622.16 --> 8627.28
yeah tony yeah i still have them open i

8624.56 --> 8629.6
will check them out

8627.28 --> 8631.04
i mean have plenty of time

8629.6 --> 8633.28
i've already

8631.04 --> 8637.28
gone through all the owen benjamin show

8633.28 --> 8640.6
so i got a whole sunday to check out

8637.28 --> 8640.6
other videos

8646.64 --> 8650.16
no one comes through the father but

8648.72 --> 8652.479
through me

8650.16 --> 8655.52
yeah but what does that mean though

8652.479 --> 8660.0
is that through his methodology

8655.52 --> 8663.359
the effective way to spiritually ascend

8660.0 --> 8666.8
or is it you have to chant the riddle

8663.359 --> 8671.28
that everybody in their chance

8666.8 --> 8672.96
or you'll not be one of the special boys

8671.28 --> 8675.28
that goes to the good place and

8672.96 --> 8676.24
everybody else goes to the bad place

8675.28 --> 8678.560000000001
right

8676.24 --> 8682.439
so which one is does that mean

8678.56 --> 8682.439
for this boy right

8687.28 --> 8690.560000000001
see the complication there

8691.6 --> 8696.24
the bourbon chicken

8693.6 --> 8700.0
is okay

8696.24 --> 8700.0
sounds interesting there tony whitcomb

8706.0 --> 8710.56
right yeah i yeah

8708.64 --> 8712.72
i'm very happy with today's show it was

8710.56 --> 8715.279999999999
kind of over the place but it's been

8712.72 --> 8718.0
intense and i like that

8715.28 --> 8720.399000000001
people inserted intense compacted

8718.0 --> 8722.64
questions and i can do a lot with that

8720.399 --> 8724.399
you i hope you guys are noticing right

8722.64 --> 8726.88
if somebody's like coming in out of

8724.399 --> 8729.439
nowhere and they ask like a real

8726.88 --> 8732.64
compacted question that has like energy

8729.439 --> 8734.399
in it and suddenly i'll just roll out 15

8732.64 --> 8736.88
minutes of conversation in all

8734.399 --> 8739.279999999999
directions but relevant about it it's

8736.88 --> 8743.119999999999
what i can do it's because

8739.28 --> 8745.6
you brought it into my workshop

8743.12 --> 8747.76
you you came up with that you put it

8745.6 --> 8749.2
together you assembled it in my workshop

8747.76 --> 8751.439
and now

8749.2 --> 8754.319000000001
i can use that

8751.439 --> 8756.56
it works great and i love you guys being

8754.319 --> 8758.399
in the chat and actually doing it and i

8756.56 --> 8760.8
hope you're enjoying it i really do

8758.399 --> 8760.8
right it's

8761.84 --> 8768.08
it's supposed to be invigorating and

8764.8 --> 8772.16
inspiring to be there and do that it is

8768.08 --> 8772.16
for me and i hope it is for you guys too

8776.64 --> 8781.84
hmm

8778.24 --> 8781.84
all right make me hungry tony we'd come

8782.8 --> 8789.199999999999
it shows part of the trinity oh dear god

8786.08 --> 8791.28
i don't believe in it no that that's

8789.2 --> 8792.560000000001
i don't believe in the chant of the

8791.28 --> 8794.880000000001
trinity

8792.56 --> 8797.039999999999
like the father and the son are one and

8794.88 --> 8799.599999999999
it's all literal that's the part i think

8797.04 --> 8801.12
is quite ridiculous however

8799.6 --> 8802.720000000001
trinity

8801.12 --> 8806.84
as a

8802.72 --> 8810.399
spiritual mechanical concept is

8806.84 --> 8812.0
quite pronounced it's quite there it's

8810.399 --> 8814.8
just not

8812.0 --> 8817.12
what we tend to think it is it's more

8814.8 --> 8819.42
like a

8817.12 --> 8820.720000000001
a glyph it's like a pattern

8819.42 --> 8822.479
