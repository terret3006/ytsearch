right weather

109.079 --> 115.75899999999999
today it started out really nice and

111.68 --> 119.47900000000001
sunny but then it kind of became

115.759 --> 120.92
clouded so so I did go out for some

119.479 --> 122.439
grocer

120.92 --> 125.71900000000001
right

122.439 --> 129.6
before the clouds basically

125.719 --> 129.6
uh covered it all

132.04 --> 137.64
up naturally though didn't see any

135.0 --> 137.64
Trails or

139.16 --> 146.35999999999999
anything it's a little bit of wind but

142.72 --> 146.35999999999999
it's not like a

148.84 --> 151.84
lot

153.28 --> 155.76
all

154.12 --> 158.59900000000002
right

155.76 --> 161.92
temperatures decent it's still a bit

158.599 --> 164.159
cold but not really cold anymore I mean

161.92 --> 166.599
it's definitely it feels like springtime

164.159 --> 168.72
so that's

166.599 --> 174.44
nice

168.72 --> 174.44
right so it's Saturday the 9th of March

177.84 --> 183.4
2024 temperature

180.599 --> 189.2
it's 13°

183.4 --> 190.87900000000002
C oh it says rain okay well not noticing

189.2 --> 195.2
that at

190.879 --> 195.2
all relatively low

195.84 --> 200.84
humidity 16 km the

201.06 --> 205.13
[Music]

204.04 --> 208.20999999999998
hell

205.13 --> 208.21
[Music]

208.76 --> 211.76

245.519 --> 249.079
troll think I'm going

249.599 --> 256.71999999999997
to just block

253.079 --> 256.72

261.04 --> 264.04
annoying

268.72 --> 273.03900000000004

he been doing that for a while I don't

273.039 --> 279.12
know why he doesn't talk or anything

275.96 --> 281.75899999999996
weird g whatever whoever the [ __ ] you

279.12 --> 285.8
are probably the same [ __ ] troll

281.759 --> 288.72
that's been like doing that [ __ ]

285.8 --> 290.639
whatever anyway hello regular Richard

288.72 --> 294.03900000000004
good to see

290.639 --> 294.039
you how are you

298.639 --> 301.639
doing

308.68 --> 317.36
right so

312.36 --> 320.84000000000003
yeah building pretty decently well

317.36 --> 324.639
today had a surprisingly good

320.84 --> 328.63899999999995
sleep thought it would be worse

324.639 --> 330.72
but you're good lunch break

328.639 --> 333.72
good lunch

330.72 --> 333.72
break

335.16 --> 343.0
H so you're in England I take it

339.16 --> 343.0
then or something like

345.28 --> 349.479
that

347.4 --> 351.44
right

349.479 --> 354.68
anyway

351.44 --> 357.759
yeah don't really have a direct subject

354.68 --> 359.68
at the ready there's some yeah I haven't

357.759 --> 360.36
really watched anything like on Netflix

359.68 --> 362.84000000000003
or

360.36 --> 365.88
anything still got that series that I

362.84 --> 368.599
want to continue watching but yeah

365.88 --> 371.599
didn't get to it lots of phone yeah

368.599 --> 374.0
phone talk over the phone and all that

371.599 --> 376.599
which is very

374.0 --> 379.44
helpful and I think I'm like slowly

376.599 --> 379.44
getting out of

381.479 --> 385.31899999999996
this this period of

388.56 --> 393.52
dread

390.919 --> 393.52
and

397.56 --> 403.44
yeah and financially it's also just like

400.919 --> 403.44
looking

404.16 --> 409.88000000000005
better like I can't believe I still have

407.319 --> 412.91900000000004
like some money in the bank like at this

409.88 --> 416.199
point like normally I'd be like oh I

412.919 --> 418.15999999999997
really need support right now please but

416.199 --> 421.8
uh

418.16 --> 421.8
yeah not so

422.639 --> 429.96000000000004
much it's kind of interesting I'm just

427.4 --> 431.919
thinking like how is this going to work

429.96 --> 434.919
out on the long

431.919 --> 434.919
run

434.96 --> 438.31899999999996
like yeah

440.44 --> 447.639
anyway got Illuminati C on a standby and

444.4 --> 449.31899999999996
yeah I can actually afford that so

447.639 --> 450.039
everybody can stop complaining about

449.319 --> 454.16
that

450.039 --> 456.52
and also none of your [ __ ] business

454.16 --> 459.0
anybody who thinks they're they feel the

456.52 --> 462.12
need to Father me or

459.0 --> 464.639
meddle with how I do these things it's

462.12 --> 466.24
none of your damn

464.639 --> 469.68
business

466.24 --> 469.68
okay just as

470.72 --> 475.44000000000005
a

472.72 --> 478.44000000000005
preamble

475.44 --> 480.68
anyway yesterday's show was very

478.44 --> 483.28
surprising

480.68 --> 486.40000000000003
was not like that's happened before like

483.28 --> 489.039
where it's like the first part is just

486.4 --> 491.159
like kind of slow and then suddenly at

489.039 --> 492.87899999999996
some point it suddenly picks up and that

491.159 --> 497.319
happened yesterday

492.879 --> 497.319
day which was hilarious and

497.479 --> 504.039
like yeah I did get kind of a kick out

500.84 --> 506.52
of it first time I got kind

504.039 --> 511.44
of angry

506.52 --> 511.44
again because of all the Bal heartedness

513.2 --> 520.2
just it was also just a reminder to me

517.2 --> 523.159
like these people make me

520.2 --> 526.2
sick they really

523.159 --> 529.24
do like anti flat

526.2 --> 531.72
earthers that just keep whining and

529.24 --> 534.36
whining and like moving past the

531.72 --> 537.279
argument and they never end it never

534.36 --> 540.36
ends it's bizarre because like the

537.279 --> 542.6
amount of effort and psychological

540.36 --> 544.76
gymnastics that they basically have

542.6 --> 547.8000000000001
invested in that

544.76 --> 552.6
process is like more effort than most

547.8 --> 552.5999999999999
people put in their jobs it's quite

554.56 --> 558.3599999999999
insane and they keep doing

559.76 --> 568.36
it right hello Ben Johnston good to see

564.2 --> 571.36
you ease up early this

568.36 --> 571.36
morning

573.959 --> 579.68
good yeah me too was really nice and

576.72 --> 582.36
sunny and slept well at a shower

579.68 --> 585.8
yesterday which by the way it's kind of

582.36 --> 588.04
bizarre like how long I postponed that

585.8 --> 590.56
but I mean like quitting smoking

588.04 --> 593.8389999999999
cannabis has really like

590.56 --> 593.8389999999999
rearranged like

595.56 --> 600.079
everything ever told us what the angle

598.12 --> 604.6
is used for you

600.079 --> 609.16
navigation uh you cross reference it

604.6 --> 611.0400000000001
with the celestial map and the GP points

609.16 --> 614.4399999999999
as to

611.04 --> 617.04
estimate where you're at in relation to

614.44 --> 620.6800000000001
the GP point of the celestial

617.04 --> 623.24
body that's what you do with it right

620.68 --> 626.2399999999999
but all those things are pretty much

623.24 --> 626.24
like

626.959 --> 633.04
negligible if you're just just going to

629.8 --> 634.519
focus like I do on what the very process

633.04 --> 639.16
is that you

634.519 --> 642.079
do you take the the angle to the Horizon

639.16 --> 644.48
from a flat Baseline so I'm not really

642.079 --> 646.3199999999999
even interested you know I'm not really

644.48 --> 647.88
interested in Celestial navigation that

646.32 --> 650.0
much it's pretty cool and all that it's

647.88 --> 652.12
cool to be able to do that and I'm sure

650.0 --> 655.959
there's some [ __ ] [ __ ]

652.12 --> 657.519
Globe projection type thing that you

655.959 --> 659.88
were like oh but we use the globe

657.519 --> 663.6
projection yeah but you take a

659.88 --> 666.2
an angle to the Horizon a flat Baseline

663.6 --> 668.88
though so you take an angle from a flat

666.2 --> 673.6800000000001
Earth and then you might presuppose that

668.88 --> 675.959
you're going to basically use that flat

673.68 --> 679.2399999999999
angle on a glob

675.959 --> 682.279
projection but yeah that's double think

679.24 --> 685.9590000000001
and I don't care I don't care that you

682.279 --> 688.2
can then bend the Flat Earth measurement

685.959 --> 690.399
into a globe in your mind and that

688.2 --> 693.12
satisfies you that you're living on a

690.399 --> 696.079
globe because that's just

693.12 --> 698.12
[ __ ] and I don't care I don't care

696.079 --> 700.3599999999999
that you do that you can do that yeah

698.12 --> 702.839
you can live on your [ __ ] Globe okay

700.36 --> 706.32
just go live on your [ __ ]

702.839 --> 709.0
Globe but yeah just know that when you

706.32 --> 711.519
do Celestial navigation you take a flat

709.0 --> 712.639
Earth measurement and that's a fact

711.519 --> 717.0
that's a

712.639 --> 721.519
recorded recorded on paper instruction

717.0 --> 723.68
based fact and so that is it that is all

721.519 --> 723.68
it

723.839 --> 728.24
is hey seeking star water good to see

736.45 --> 739.609
[Music]

741.68 --> 745.279
you right but yeah that was like the

744.12 --> 749.24
very

745.279 --> 751.24
last 3/4 of an hour on yesterday's Super

749.24 --> 753.04
long show I mean yesterday this was like

751.24 --> 756.839
another record length

753.04 --> 760.959
show pretty crazy with several

756.839 --> 767.0790000000001
faces first hour I was really like kind

760.959 --> 767.079
of silent and then gradually started to

767.199 --> 773.56
basically share and resolve what was on

769.92 --> 775.399
my heart that made me like

773.56 --> 777.76
that and

775.399 --> 781.48
then

777.76 --> 781.48
yeah fight with the

783.399 --> 789.639
ballards like

785.079 --> 789.6389999999999
a long three course

791.8 --> 800.8
meal 4 hours and 26 minutes if you can

795.519 --> 803.44
believe it pretty damn long

800.8 --> 806.639
right still thought thought that the

803.44 --> 809.24
episode 1886 was better though it was

806.639 --> 811.519
only 3 hours but it was just like way

809.24 --> 811.519
more

816.36 --> 825.0790000000001
interesting hello carrots on fire of

820.0 --> 825.079
fire 4 One India I don't give a

826.32 --> 832.8000000000001
[ __ ] yeah I'm not interested in that at

829.04 --> 836.519
all I'm not interested in India at

832.8 --> 838.04
all and nothing that relates to

836.519 --> 840.72
it

838.04 --> 841.92
understand so if you're going to whine

840.72 --> 845.44
about

841.92 --> 848.8
Cricket I'm kicking you

845.44 --> 848.8000000000001
out you got

849.12 --> 855.68
it because that's always what that is

851.88 --> 855.68
it's the only [ __ ] thing they even do

868.04 --> 872.4399999999999
there

870.959 --> 874.04
ah you're looking into Celestia

872.44 --> 876.839
navigation books

874.04 --> 879.92
cool right have you noticed the graph

876.839 --> 883.36
yet where you're like taking an angle

879.92 --> 884.399
from the center of the sphere over a

883.36 --> 887.519
flat

884.399 --> 890.48
plane cuz that's always a very telling

887.519 --> 893.92
diagram that they use that Ballers like

890.48 --> 897.1990000000001
that is like ball belief

893.92 --> 897.199
support it's

898.04 --> 902.24
ridiculous

899.8 --> 903.3599999999999
it's only like the ball's not doesn't

902.24 --> 907.6800000000001
need to be

903.36 --> 907.6800000000001
there it is just over a flat

922.519 --> 927.6
plane right but uh

925.16 --> 930.959
yeah let me know if you find more

927.6 --> 930.9590000000001
interesting stuff

957.92 --> 960.92
um

964.92 --> 971.519
think I'm GNA kind of hungry I'm going

967.88 --> 974.16
to put l kasan in the oven right now a

971.519 --> 976.0
bit early normally I do that a bit later

974.16 --> 980.639
in the show but I feel like it right now

976.0 --> 980.639
so I'm going to do it right now be right

987.92 --> 990.92
back

1017.839 --> 1020.839
e

1047.84 --> 1050.84
for

1069.679 --> 1072.679
back

1077.159 --> 1081.7990000000002
right I've been thinking also I should

1080.2 --> 1086.6000000000001
probably

1081.799 --> 1088.36
now collect more diagrams and pictures

1086.6 --> 1092.6
I've been kind of negligent with

1088.36 --> 1096.559
collecting those just kind of

1092.6 --> 1100.08
stupid really now that I think about

1096.559 --> 1105.48
it but yeah I was always like no other

1100.08 --> 1105.48
people do that I don't need to do that

1106.159 --> 1111.44
but that was kind of foolish in

1112.159 --> 1117.0390000000002
retrospect

1113.84 --> 1118.8799999999999
so yeah Ben Johnson if you find some

1117.039 --> 1120.96
interesting

1118.88 --> 1125.679
diagrams

1120.96 --> 1128.0
uh please send them over the mail right

1125.679 --> 1129.919
if people find good diagrams or even

1128.0 --> 1132.4
like really interesting

1129.919 --> 1135.96
pictures I'm always ready to like

1132.4 --> 1140.72
receive them over mail for my email

1135.96 --> 1140.72
email address right in description box

1140.96 --> 1145.039
and then uh yeah I can basically check

1143.12 --> 1148.039
them

1145.039 --> 1150.84
out and store

1148.039 --> 1154.2
them and then even use them and show

1150.84 --> 1156.4399999999998
them on the show like if it were a

1154.2 --> 1159.159
discussion to break

1156.44 --> 1163.559
out right but of course you can always

1159.159 --> 1166.2800000000002
like go and watch like 10th man's

1163.559 --> 1168.2
presentations about Celestial navigation

1166.28 --> 1171.32
he's done like the most elaborate

1168.2 --> 1172.72
detailed presentations about it on Flat

1171.32 --> 1175.76
Earth

1172.72 --> 1177.32
debates it's a while ago but they're

1175.76 --> 1179.559
still

1177.32 --> 1181.3999999999999
there I might have some on his own

1179.559 --> 1184.8799999999999
channel as

1181.4 --> 1188.679
well right but my thing has always been

1184.88 --> 1191.7990000000002
like I don't like to really I like to

1188.679 --> 1194.8400000000001
just be able to explain it verbally so

1191.799 --> 1197.6399999999999
that I

1194.84 --> 1199.32
could go on the

1197.64 --> 1202.3200000000002
street

1199.32 --> 1207.2
bump into somebody and then verbally

1202.32 --> 1209.72
explain it right no mobile no Graphics

1207.2 --> 1211.1200000000001
no piece of paper necessary I just

1209.72 --> 1214.44
explain

1211.12 --> 1216.1589999999999
it that's been my focus and that's also

1214.44 --> 1219.24
part of the reasons why I don't really

1216.159 --> 1221.4
collect all these diagrams because I

1219.24 --> 1223.52
just want to be able to verbally explain

1221.4 --> 1224.48
it and I think I've gotten pretty good

1223.52 --> 1230.6399999999999
at

1224.48 --> 1230.64
it and yeah yesterday proved that

1233.0 --> 1240.32
all right so [ __ ] trolls have to ban

1236.64 --> 1243.3200000000002
some there no point guys you're not

1240.32 --> 1243.32
going to get through

1248.36 --> 1252.799
ever yeah nobody's going to see it

1253.42 --> 1257.6000000000001
[Music]

1255.6 --> 1260.28
nobody

1257.6 --> 1262.559
uh

1260.28 --> 1262.559
all

1263.32 --> 1266.32
right

1268.96 --> 1275.44
see like in Dutch alternative news there

1273.279 --> 1277.96
is so

1275.44 --> 1280.64
many stuff

1277.96 --> 1284.159
about how do

1280.64 --> 1286.48
you say that access death there's so

1284.159 --> 1289.5590000000002
many things about that

1286.48 --> 1294.32
now talk hey Ben why do you think I'm

1289.559 --> 1294.32
deleting it not for you to address

1295.12 --> 1299.8799999999999
it it's not football I don't know what

1297.88 --> 1304.919
the hell it is but it has no place in

1299.88 --> 1307.8400000000001
here yeah go go and keep your stupid

1304.919 --> 1310.96
scores on your [ __ ] little Discord

1307.84 --> 1313.1999999999998
troll Forum okay go and spam that [ __ ]

1310.96 --> 1316.72
there that people care there because

1313.2 --> 1316.72
they're [ __ ] yeah not

1317.52 --> 1321.96
here

1319.32 --> 1321.96
yeah go

1325.279 --> 1331.32
there football Cricket sports scores I

1328.76 --> 1333.679
don't care I literally don't care I will

1331.32 --> 1337.559
delete

1333.679 --> 1340.6000000000001
you right so if you want to be able to

1337.559 --> 1343.32
regularly with your account just comment

1340.6 --> 1345.36
talk get involved then don't mention

1343.32 --> 1349.1589999999999
that because the next person that does I

1345.36 --> 1351.039
will just ban them yeah I only deleted

1349.159 --> 1354.48
carrot of Fire's message because he's

1351.039 --> 1357.2
just like a

1354.48 --> 1360.44
guy but if you do that again I will ban

1357.2 --> 1367.0
you I don't care I don't

1360.44 --> 1367.0
care no Sports crap at

1375.48 --> 1380.44
all talking about important things here

1380.88 --> 1386.44
maybe maybe will will it all depends on

1384.08 --> 1389.08
what we're going to address today Ben

1386.44 --> 1390.559
Johnston and I'm not entirely sure yet I

1389.08 --> 1392.36
get the feeling it's going to be more

1390.559 --> 1396.36
about Celestial navigation because

1392.36 --> 1397.279
yesterday I basically Kindle that Kindle

1396.36 --> 1400.76
got a

1397.279 --> 1404.679
spark I got on fire and the whole ball

1400.76 --> 1408.84
tarted guys were I mean you're liter

1404.679 --> 1411.48
like remember from Life of Brian when

1408.84 --> 1414.9189999999999
they basically think that he is the

1411.48 --> 1417.1200000000001
Messiah and like oh everybody's just

1414.919 --> 1420.1200000000001
wants wants his Blessing or whatever and

1417.12 --> 1423.8799999999999
then like oh the devil like those

1420.12 --> 1427.12
possessed by Devils stand in a row over

1423.88 --> 1428.919
there yeah that's the [ __ ] Ballers

1427.12 --> 1430.6399999999999
when this kind of subject comes up they

1428.919 --> 1436.88
just become

1430.64 --> 1436.88
completely nuts possessed by Devils bald

1437.44 --> 1442.289
devils

1439.2 --> 1442.289
[Music]

1446.98 --> 1449.63
[Music]

1449.42 --> 1460.319
[Applause]

1449.63 --> 1460.3190000000002
[Music]

1461.96 --> 1465.88
start out I'm putting that in in the

1467.36 --> 1470.36
title

1478.36 --> 1483.24
what's the dip correction they're

1479.799 --> 1486.679
talking about it's the dip correction

1483.24 --> 1490.3990000000001
from the I level to the

1486.679 --> 1493.52
Horizon and it's pretty much the same

1490.399 --> 1495.36
everywhere like at any height right

1493.52 --> 1499.2
because

1495.36 --> 1501.6
practically and you could argue why why

1499.2 --> 1505.039
well

1501.6 --> 1509.4399999999998
practically The Horizon is always

1505.039 --> 1511.919
slightly below I level but that stays if

1509.44 --> 1513.76
you go up right it's not oh it's

1511.919 --> 1518.039
slightly below eye level because you're

1513.76 --> 1519.679
so high up no even if you go higher up

1518.039 --> 1521.399
it's still going to be slightly below

1519.679 --> 1522.799
eye level and that's what the correction

1521.399 --> 1525.1589999999999
is

1522.799 --> 1529.279
for that's why this dip correction

1525.159 --> 1531.64
doesn't like increase enormously L if

1529.279 --> 1534.2
you are at a great height doing

1531.64 --> 1534.2
Celestial

1540.84 --> 1545.24
navigation so it's not necessarily

1545.72 --> 1552.799
nonsense how long did it take me to

1549.36 --> 1557.399
master it uh while sitting through about

1552.799 --> 1560.24
a year of 10th Man presenting it on a

1557.399 --> 1560.2399999999998
daily weekly

1561.12 --> 1566.08
basis there were a lot of misconceptions

1564.08 --> 1568.48
about it and like as soon as the subject

1566.08 --> 1571.08
really came in ball Tarts did all that

1568.48 --> 1572.48
[ __ ] that we experienced yesterday they

1571.08 --> 1575.72
did that immediately it's like

1572.48 --> 1578.84
immediately so confusion right like oh

1575.72 --> 1580.96
we don't use the Horizon as a reference

1578.84 --> 1583.72
we just do an arbitrary line in the

1580.96 --> 1585.24
middle of the air like a straight line

1583.72 --> 1588.48
over the

1585.24 --> 1591.799
globe right that that [ __ ] that started

1588.48 --> 1594.799
early or even like oh we don't need a

1591.799 --> 1596.44
horizontal we just use a plum to

1594.799 --> 1600.0
establish

1596.44 --> 1602.679
vertical right it's the same thing it's

1600.0 --> 1607.159
like yeah so you're on a ball The

1602.679 --> 1609.919
Horizon is geometric on that ball and

1607.159 --> 1614.44
so yeah the dip correction is not going

1609.919 --> 1617.279
to be minute especially at Great

1614.44 --> 1620.039
height it's going to be a lot and

1617.279 --> 1623.72
growing the the further you go

1620.039 --> 1626.919
up but yeah Ballers like to not give

1623.72 --> 1631.279
recognition to that hey buckbuster gets

1626.919 --> 1635.5590000000002
see you you got here late no not that

1631.279 --> 1635.559
late it's not even a half hour

1635.799 --> 1640.039
in you got a sexon oh

1647.159 --> 1650.159
cool

1650.399 --> 1656.1999999999998
right so blackbuster when you did use

1653.72 --> 1661.3990000000001
that sexon on the

1656.2 --> 1665.559
ocean did you use a plumbob to establish

1661.399 --> 1668.9189999999999
vertical or did you use the

1665.559 --> 1668.9189999999999
Horizon as a

1669.76 --> 1675.6
horizontal with a slight dip correction

1673.0 --> 1675.6
which one was

1675.64 --> 1681.24
it cuz all those ball Tarts that say oh

1678.88 --> 1684.3990000000001
we don't use the Horizon they've never

1681.24 --> 1687.84
they probably never even set foot on a

1684.399 --> 1687.84
boat in their

1689.039 --> 1693.48
lives like land bound

1695.48 --> 1698.759
[Music]

1706.399 --> 1716.12
rats oh God ruv

1709.799 --> 1719.72
wow yeah ruv is real he is really

1716.12 --> 1719.7199999999998
thick that guy is

1721.24 --> 1725.72
nuts he's still holding on to the

1723.559 --> 1729.2
geometric

1725.72 --> 1732.84
Horizon like a lot like he doesn't even

1729.2 --> 1732.8400000000001
understand the argument at that

1734.799 --> 1741.1589999999999
point R has been like U an anti flat

1738.36 --> 1744.12
earther that's tried to involve himself

1741.159 --> 1747.3600000000001
with flat ear the base for a

1744.12 --> 1752.039
decade very tiresome

1747.36 --> 1755.84
guy and a liar like a really

1752.039 --> 1757.679
Sly dirty slippery

1755.84 --> 1763.84
liar will

1757.679 --> 1763.8400000000001
lie to your face with a smile creepy

1764.84 --> 1773.32
guy rain sexon doesn't have a plumbob it

1768.679 --> 1773.3200000000002
doesn't oh wow who could have foreseen

1776.88 --> 1782.6000000000001
that Horizon meets the sky yeah that's

1779.519 --> 1784.24
what the Horizon is you are established

1782.6 --> 1786.279
yeah you could think of that but the

1784.24 --> 1789.96
point is you're using the

1786.279 --> 1793.72
Horizon you start out with the

1789.96 --> 1795.3990000000001
visual vantage point of the Horizon to

1793.72 --> 1799.3600000000001
do your

1795.399 --> 1801.799
thing yeah you don't create your own

1799.36 --> 1801.799
fake

1802.0 --> 1807.32
Horizon through Plum through of plumbob

1805.32 --> 1810.039
also because yeah using a plum Bob on

1807.32 --> 1812.039
the ocean is uh going to be problematic

1810.039 --> 1815.36
always because hey the ocean moves

1812.039 --> 1818.12
around and you need to be kind of still

1815.36 --> 1822.6789999999999
to effectively use a plum

1818.12 --> 1822.6789999999999
right it's a land

1823.2 --> 1829.96
instrument that's right plumbob would be

1825.519 --> 1829.96
a bit wobbly and that's like

1831.84 --> 1838.1999999999998
extremely yeah makes it impossible like

1835.96 --> 1840.519
you can't really establish an accurate

1838.2 --> 1842.039
angle if it just keeps the angle just

1840.519 --> 1844.279
keeps moving it's like yeah how are you

1842.039 --> 1846.96
going to get an accurate reading then

1844.279 --> 1849.24
right well you don't you don't use a

1846.96 --> 1852.24
plum on the ocean for that

1849.24 --> 1856.36
reason you use it on

1852.24 --> 1859.36
land like surveyors may use a

1856.36 --> 1862.7199999999998
plumbob on land

1859.36 --> 1866.639
why well it's very handy to use on land

1862.72 --> 1870.679
because the land is not even and in many

1866.639 --> 1873.639
places The Horizon will be obstructed by

1870.679 --> 1876.5590000000002
mountains or Hills but you still need to

1873.639 --> 1880.32
know where it is so then you can and

1876.559 --> 1883.08
will use a plumbob to establish that

1880.32 --> 1884.399
horizontal but on the ocean well there's

1883.08 --> 1886.399
not a lot of things that are going to

1884.399 --> 1889.559
obstruct The

1886.399 --> 1891.2399999999998
Horizon and

1889.559 --> 1893.48
using a Plumb by the ocean doesn't

1891.24 --> 1893.48
really

1902.639 --> 1909.08
work uh let you be clear dep correction

1906.08 --> 1909.08
values

1910.76 --> 1916.2
no I'm the Earth being a spirit no

1913.24 --> 1919.559
that's nonsense it

1916.2 --> 1922.279
isn't I mean you think of it as such but

1919.559 --> 1924.36
that's not the case because then dip

1922.279 --> 1929.2
correction would differentiate

1924.36 --> 1929.1999999999998
enormously with height it

1933.24 --> 1939.1200000000001
doesn't so hey it might say that in the

1936.399 --> 1941.9599999999998
book right there's a lot of like Globe

1939.12 --> 1945.279
belief reinforcement in those books at

1941.96 --> 1948.72
times like I said on the inside of a

1945.279 --> 1952.519
sphere over a flat plane they show that

1948.72 --> 1954.24
but practically it isn't so it might say

1952.519 --> 1957.279
oh it's based on the Earth being a

1954.24 --> 1959.799
sphere it's that's just a

1957.279 --> 1961.799
lie if it was based on the Earth being a

1959.799 --> 1963.639
sphere then dip correction would like

1961.799 --> 1965.679
start to vary with

1963.639 --> 1970.039
height and it

1965.679 --> 1970.039
doesn't it doesn't vary with

1976.84 --> 1979.84
height

1986.6 --> 1992.559
how much would it vary if it was a

1989.36 --> 1992.559
sphere a

1995.919 --> 2001.6000000000001
lot because on a sphere the geomet The

1998.96 --> 2001.6000000000001
Horizon is

2006.76 --> 2009.76
geometric

2010.279 --> 2014.919
okay well hey buckbuster I didn't know

2012.48 --> 2016.72
you were a [ __ ] balart that's fine

2014.919 --> 2017.679
you can just say that you can just

2016.72 --> 2022.919
assert

2017.679 --> 2025.919
it it's wrong though it's not how it

2022.919 --> 2025.919
works

2026.96 --> 2034.8400000000001
yeah but but keep keep saying it just

2029.679 --> 2034.8400000000001
keep saying it it'll make it true it

2036.72 --> 2039.72
isn't

2046.24 --> 2050.679
lots of

2047.24 --> 2054.48
citations who gives a

2050.679 --> 2060.879
[ __ ] you're taking the angle over a flat

2054.48 --> 2060.879
plane and take an angle to a curved

2066.72 --> 2069.72
Baseline

2084.399 --> 2088.359
yeah right

2085.72 --> 2091.2
buckbuster yeah I've heard that [ __ ]

2088.359 --> 2093.839
before no there's no [ __ ] Ballard in

2091.2 --> 2096.96
the [ __ ] world that said that and

2093.839 --> 2100.7999999999997
meant it you're a Ballard you're an anti

2096.96 --> 2103.8
flat earther pretty damn sure now and

2100.8 --> 2104.42
yeah spare me your [ __ ] okay I'm

2103.8 --> 2105.6400000000003
going to get my

2104.42 --> 2108.64

2156.64 --> 2159.64
e

2169.24 --> 2174.1189999999997
you rise up oh look is

2186.56 --> 2189.56
that

2191.92 --> 2196.0
lots of other things that's fine but it

2194.92 --> 2197.599
is what it

2196.0 --> 2202.0
[Music]

2197.599 --> 2203.56
is yeah the Horizon is not

2202.0 --> 2205.88
geometric

2203.56 --> 2211.119
yeah it

2205.88 --> 2213.96
isn't you use the Horizon in Celestial

2211.119 --> 2217.6400000000003
navigation it's what you

2213.96 --> 2220.119
use now you can think of di correction

2217.64 --> 2223.839
being oh it's all comparted to a sphere

2220.119 --> 2226.1600000000003
oh just like the autographic view tells

2223.839 --> 2228.96
you that the Horizon is viom metric that

2226.16 --> 2230.92
you're looking over a sphere and and

2228.96 --> 2233.88
that's the Horizon yeah but that thing

2230.92 --> 2237.599
is wrong and it excludes

2233.88 --> 2239.7200000000003
perspective it hijacks it and yeah they

2237.599 --> 2242.6800000000003
might have used some kind of system in

2239.72 --> 2245.9599999999996
there in Celestial navigation

2242.68 --> 2248.9199999999996
calculation just to fool you that you're

2245.96 --> 2252.599
doing it over a sphere but in reality

2248.92 --> 2255.96
The Horizon Rises with

2252.599 --> 2257.28
you and stays consistently slightly

2255.96 --> 2262.44
below I

2257.28 --> 2266.8
level that's why you don't really factor

2262.44 --> 2270.56
in the height all that much at

2266.8 --> 2273.599
all and that's a fact yeah dip

2270.56 --> 2276.119
correction is pretty consistent

2273.599 --> 2279.44
everywhere at any

2276.119 --> 2279.44
height h

2280.16 --> 2287.5989999999997
now any manual could tell

2284.96 --> 2290.28
you this nonsense oh it's based on a

2287.599 --> 2293.119
sphere but it's

2290.28 --> 2296.8
[ __ ]

2293.119 --> 2300.7200000000003
yeah it's [ __ ] it's just not

2296.8 --> 2303.4
true The Horizon Rises with

2300.72 --> 2305.5989999999997
you you don't leave it behind when you

2303.4 --> 2305.599
go

2306.44 --> 2309.44
up

2316.28 --> 2322.2000000000003
I I

2318.599 --> 2325.3590000000004
mean it's just the same as

2322.2 --> 2328.5989999999997
yesterday it does drop though yeah

2325.359 --> 2331.119
slightly slightly and then it stays at

2328.599 --> 2334.48
the slightly dropped height that's why I

2331.119 --> 2336.44
say it's slightly below eye level it's

2334.48 --> 2338.2
not exactly eye level it's slightly

2336.44 --> 2342.359
below eye level which you go higher up

2338.2 --> 2344.2
and it stays at the same angle slightly

2342.359 --> 2348.7599999999998
below eye level

2344.2 --> 2352.2799999999997
yeah the angle to your eye The Horizon

2348.76 --> 2352.28
stays the same as you go

2357.95 --> 2361.1499999999996
[Music]

2366.359 --> 2371.44
up

2368.48 --> 2371.44
doesn't say yeah it

2386.079 --> 2391.1600000000003
does yes

2389.52 --> 2393.44
ridiculous

2391.16 --> 2396.319
look you could think you have an

2393.44 --> 2398.2400000000002
argument there but the Horizon is not

2396.319 --> 2400.839
geometric

2398.24 --> 2404.24
there's no

2400.839 --> 2407.4
point yeah like I might might not be

2404.24 --> 2409.839
able to tell you like exactly

2407.4 --> 2412.079
mathematically what how the the

2409.839 --> 2414.2799999999997
construction Works in this false

2412.079 --> 2417.599
assumption that it's based on the radius

2414.28 --> 2419.3190000000004
of Earth it's all very cute but I mean

2417.599 --> 2422.96
there's been

2419.319 --> 2426.24
observations yeah that

2422.96 --> 2426.2400000000002
disprove that

2426.319 --> 2432.96
radius so it's

2430.0 --> 2435.839
done the Earth is not that

2432.96 --> 2437.839
sphere now you can use some calculations

2435.839 --> 2442.48
based on the assumption that it is that

2437.839 --> 2445.56
sphere but it isn't it isn't that sphere

2442.48 --> 2448.96
yes Black Swan that's what the argument

2445.56 --> 2451.72
called Black Swan it's not that sphere

2448.96 --> 2454.88
now you can still use calculations based

2451.72 --> 2456.24
on assuming that it is but it isn't it

2454.88 --> 2459.2400000000002
isn't that

2456.24 --> 2459.24
sphere

2463.44 --> 2468.599
so keep keep on just pumping out the

2646.8 --> 2653.76
like I don't need

2649.52 --> 2656.44
to you guys have like tons of shitty

stop so yeah I don't think I'm going to

2659.24 --> 2663.7999999999997
ever unban trolls ever again you get

2662.16 --> 2666.44
banned you're gone

2663.8 --> 2668.44
forever just make more of your shitty

2666.44 --> 2670.64

[Music]

2882.559 --> 2887.96
per degree Oh you mean per degree that

2884.96 --> 2889.76
you assume that you assume based on a

2887.96 --> 2893.359
presupposed sphere that you're moving

2889.76 --> 2893.3590000000004
over Kum virus

2894.44 --> 2899.079
yeah how exactly did you establish that

2898.04 --> 2901.599
it was

2899.079 --> 2905.28
spherical how did you do

2901.599 --> 2907.2400000000002
that besides assuming it oh the

2905.28 --> 2909.0
calculations say it oh really so how did

2907.24 --> 2911.1189999999997
you measure it how did you measure the

2909.0 --> 2913.88
Earth to be a

2911.119 --> 2916.079
sphere none of you dumb asses even know

2913.88 --> 2916.079
this

2916.99 --> 2920.24
[Music]

2932.96 --> 2938.7200000000003
[ __ ] how you get the distance to the GP

2939.96 --> 2943.64
yeah you figure

2943.96 --> 2952.96
out the line the GP line

2948.52 --> 2956.119
basically which if you use a uh dis

2952.96 --> 2958.4
projection or spherical whatever you

2956.119 --> 2960.92
assume it

2958.4 --> 2962.7200000000003
is over the map because it's all about

2960.92 --> 2967.079
how the map projection work that you're

2962.72 --> 2970.5589999999997
going to use to get that GP point

2967.079 --> 2974.799
because the GP point is effectively a

2970.559 --> 2978.2000000000003
line it's a line over the map right the

2974.799 --> 2979.599
celestial sphere the apparent not

2978.2 --> 2982.72
actually

2979.599 --> 2987.92
positioned celestial sphere and all the

2982.72 --> 2988.68
lights on it rotate in circular fashion

2987.92 --> 2995.2400000000002
and

2988.68 --> 2999.24
so the GP point will be over a

2995.24 --> 3004.52
line and that's what you can figure

2999.24 --> 3007.9199999999996
out right but how what you think that is

3004.52 --> 3010.72
you can think of the GP as being over a

3007.92 --> 3014.16
circle if you assume that Polaris is at

3010.72 --> 3016.68
the center of a dis or over a sphere it

3014.16 --> 3019.5589999999997
doesn't really matter too much but

3016.68 --> 3022.48
that's still presupposing that Polaris

3019.559 --> 3022.48
is at the center

3023.0 --> 3029.76
point right also assuming that it is

3026.799 --> 3034.0
literally there as in literally like a

3029.76 --> 3034.0
light that is hovering over a

3035.2 --> 3040.24
point it uh requires a certain level of

3038.24 --> 3043.52
physicality assumption

3040.24 --> 3046.799
bias and it has not been actually

3043.52 --> 3046.799
confirmed to be the

3049.44 --> 3054.119
thing how does it work dude I don't

3052.599 --> 3057.839
watch flat

3054.119 --> 3059.88
soid why are you whining about flat soid

3057.839 --> 3061.92
yeah why don't you just wait until flat

3059.88 --> 3063.52
soy does a live stream and then whine to

3061.92 --> 3066.52
him about

3063.52 --> 3066.52
it

3085.559 --> 3089.2400000000002

3101.839 --> 3108.16
grifter can you explain the

3105.44 --> 3109.92
grift or is that just another word

3108.16 --> 3111.48
you're using you don't actually know

3109.92 --> 3114.4
what it means like a lot of [ __ ]

3111.48 --> 3118.839
ballards out there and

those words

3122.46 --> 3125.659
[Music]

3130.16 --> 3138.44

idiot [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah a grifter

3138.44 --> 3143.359
builds a

3143.359 --> 3148.52
disappears guess what Flat's not doing

3149.76 --> 3156.0
disappearing proving you're a [ __ ]

3152.359 --> 3159.16
idiot for using that word a word that

3156.0 --> 3159.16
you don't even

3160.0 --> 3165.24
understand like so many other things

3162.64 --> 3167.359
that balarts don't understand yeah hey

3165.24 --> 3169.52
like if you don't understand the very

3167.359 --> 3172.04
arguments that you're even using to try

3169.52 --> 3174.079
to claim your stupid Globe then why

3172.04 --> 3178.44
would anybody assume you understand

3323.799 --> 3330.359
past with these things

3327.52 --> 3330.359
pretending to

3331.88 --> 3339.28
be yes guys I mean Rick Beck Richard G

3336.319 --> 3342.5589999999997
that makes perfect sense right because

3339.28 --> 3345.0
what better grift than to pretend to be

3342.559 --> 3347.4
a flat earther to get money I mean

3345.0 --> 3351.119
that's like the best grift ever it's not

3347.4 --> 3354.6800000000003
like you get 90% of everyone in the

3351.119 --> 3358.2400000000002
[ __ ] internet against

3354.68 --> 3358.24
you or anything

3358.72 --> 3364.2
again that's like the dumbest thing I've

3362.0 --> 3368.039
ever

3364.2 --> 3371.0389999999998
heard I could not imagine a more

3368.039 --> 3373.3590000000004
ineffective grift than to pretend you're

3371.039 --> 3375.039
a flat earther it's the dumbest [ __ ]

3373.359 --> 3379.5989999999997
thing

3375.039 --> 3382.76
ever yeah it's the grift that makes

3379.599 --> 3385.2400000000002
people go try to go behind your back and

3382.76 --> 3387.3190000000004
get you fired from your job it's the gri

3385.24 --> 3389.8799999999997
that makes everybody lie about you and

3387.319 --> 3392.64
spread rumors about you yeah it's the

3389.88 --> 3395.559
gri that makes everybody go and Bully

3392.64 --> 3399.839
your friends to not support you I mean

3395.559 --> 3401.6400000000003
it's the dumbest [ __ ] grift idea ever

3399.839 --> 3404.72
Fair Point

3401.64 --> 3407.0789999999997
yeah I'm glad you're noticing

3404.72 --> 3409.64
that I'm glad you're noticing the

3407.079 --> 3412.92
stupidity that just came out of

3409.64 --> 3415.24
you that's a sign that there might be

3412.92 --> 3419.359
some hope for

3415.24 --> 3422.839
you all you have to do is recognize the

3419.359 --> 3425.16
ball lie Devil Within you that makes you

3422.839 --> 3427.44
say these asinine

3425.16 --> 3429.64
things and then there might be some hope

3427.44 --> 3429.64

3465.799 --> 3469.2
grifter such a

3469.559 --> 3473.6400000000003
grifter

3471.079 --> 3475.119
yes no I don't know any Flat Earth

3473.64 --> 3477.1189999999997
grifters at

3475.119 --> 3481.359
all

3477.119 --> 3485.2000000000003
except there are a few people that I

3481.359 --> 3488.64
suspect are alleged grifters one of them

3485.2 --> 3491.48
would for example be Alex

3488.64 --> 3493.5589999999997
Steen the clown Alex Steen who's like

3491.48 --> 3496.359
gone into like politics he was a flat

3493.559 --> 3500.559
earther and then oh guess what suddenly

3496.359 --> 3501.68
oh I'm not a flat earther yeah that's a

3500.559 --> 3505.119
sign of a

3501.68 --> 3508.1189999999997
grift CU he got into it because of the

3505.119 --> 3508.119
attention

3509.319 --> 3515.5589999999997
because it is considered coming out as a

3512.559 --> 3518.2000000000003
flat earther doing that is kind of Brave

3515.559 --> 3521.4
compared to like the normies out there

3518.2 --> 3523.68
who might have ideas or beliefs about

3521.4 --> 3526.119
Flat Earth but they definitely don't

3523.68 --> 3527.9199999999996
want to face the trolls so you could get

3526.119 --> 3530.76
some credit on the scene like Oh I'm a

3527.92 --> 3535.039
flat earther too you get some

3530.76 --> 3537.599
attention you grow with it and then you

3535.039 --> 3538.96

3579.15 --> 3587.2400000000002
[Music]

3583.2 --> 3587.24
me I don't see how he's a

3588.96 --> 3593.799
grifter but he is kind of like a

3591.16 --> 3597.7599999999998
businessman

3593.799 --> 3601.44
though yeah Dave wise is not a

3597.76 --> 3604.7990000000004
glober he's just like

3601.44 --> 3607.559
a basic flat earther or a discer and he

3604.799 --> 3609.319
has his app and he's a Salesman and he's

3607.559 --> 3614.2000000000003
he's he's good at it I mean he's a kind

3609.319 --> 3614.2
of a Jew and that not in a bad way

3614.24 --> 3621.5989999999997
necessarily but I mean he has been

3617.24 --> 3624.359
caught doing like sort of like being

3621.599 --> 3626.88
weird flip-floppy or whatever app

3624.359 --> 3630.64
scammer oh is a scammer

3626.88 --> 3634.28
if you sell something and it has to do

3630.64 --> 3636.2799999999997
with flat Earth you're a scammer of

3634.28 --> 3638.559
course you're a scammer because you have

3636.28 --> 3638.559
an

3639.0 --> 3642.0
app

3649.28 --> 3657.3190000000004
what salesman exactly yeah but I

3654.559 --> 3659.599
mean why not

3657.319 --> 3662.2
I'm happy for him I'm happy that he's

3659.599 --> 3662.2000000000003
doing so

3664.16 --> 3669.799
well I'm not super fond of him anymore

3667.96 --> 3672.48
there's been a lot of like things coming

3669.799 --> 3675.16
out of him that made me feel

3672.48 --> 3678.2400000000002
like he doesn't feel like the most

3675.16 --> 3680.92
trustworthy guy in

3678.24 --> 3683.359
way just feelings I mean have no

3680.92 --> 3686.2000000000003
evidence or whatever I

3683.359 --> 3690.2
mean but it's not like oh yeah yeah just

3686.2 --> 3690.2
doing this and then I'm

3693.48 --> 3700.28
leaving a flat Earth game uh

3697.559 --> 3702.6400000000003
no I don't have a flat Earth game I

3700.28 --> 3705.96
don't have flat Earth game Ambitions and

3702.64 --> 3708.4
besides every freaking 3D game ever made

3705.96 --> 3711.52
is Flat Earth game yeah you have a

3708.4 --> 3713.76
landscape you're playing in 3D that's a

3711.52 --> 3716.52
flat

3713.76 --> 3719.5200000000004
Earth there's no GL

3716.52 --> 3722.24
glob based

3719.52 --> 3725.92
landscape in 3D

3722.24 --> 3729.4799999999996
games there might be some and people get

3725.92 --> 3731.44
physically ill from playing them on

3729.48 --> 3733.76
record you should listen to Mark

3731.44 --> 3737.2000000000003
Sergeant he like he talks about that

3733.76 --> 3740.079
because he was like a gamer fanatic and

3737.2 --> 3740.0789999999997
he knows about

3741.52 --> 3749.359
that GTA space yeah but space is is

3746.2 --> 3751.279
[ __ ] though yeah when you play in

3749.359 --> 3755.0389999999998
space you

3751.279 --> 3757.92
don't you're not like oh I'm in space Oh

3755.039 --> 3759.88
a planet let's approach the planet oh

3757.92 --> 3762.359
and then you become bigger bigger you

3759.88 --> 3763.1600000000003
land on it yeah there's no games that do

3762.359 --> 3766.68
that

3763.16 --> 3770.72
huh you didn't realize that when you're

3766.68 --> 3773.48
in space in a game planets might be in

3770.72 --> 3776.839
the background but you can't really

3773.48 --> 3780.279
approach them you never can it's just

3776.839 --> 3783.4
like oh you want to go to the planet o

3780.279 --> 3786.52
cut scene see the ship go into the

3783.4 --> 3789.52
distance oh next scene oh the ship

3786.52 --> 3792.559
arrives in the atmosphere of the planet

3789.52 --> 3795.599
next scene just like NASA does it just

3792.559 --> 3799.2000000000003
like all Hollywood movies do

3795.599 --> 3801.52
it right because if you had a Non-Stop

3799.2 --> 3803.64
live transition scene with that it would

3801.52 --> 3807.7599999999998
look super

3803.64 --> 3807.7599999999998
unnatural it would feel

3808.92 --> 3813.48
natural

3810.96 --> 3816.88
yeah so what I don't know what the [ __ ]

3813.48 --> 3820.2
you even talk GTA is that really a

3816.88 --> 3820.2000000000003
thing that's

3820.799 --> 3825.48
[ __ ] like that is [ __ ] like what

3823.559 --> 3828.799
the that's how's that even supposed to

3825.48 --> 3828.799
mix make no damn

3830.2 --> 3833.2
sense

3834.72 --> 3845.839
whatever part of GTA 5 it sounds really

3840.0 --> 3847.599
lame but uh yeah then again GTA is just

3845.839 --> 3851.88
the

3847.599 --> 3854.92
worst if it were up to me I'd like make

3851.88 --> 3857.079
it internationally illegal I'd allow

3854.92 --> 3859.92
secret services to broke break in

3857.079 --> 3862.44
computers to delete all GTA software

3859.92 --> 3866.48
everywhere including game consoles

3862.44 --> 3870.2000000000003
connected to the internet GTA sucks it's

3866.48 --> 3873.2
evil it's been one of the worst cultural

3870.2 --> 3873.2
influences

3874.25 --> 3877.389
[Music]

3883.24 --> 3890.8799999999997
ever so I don't give a [ __ ] if your

3887.359 --> 3894.279
crime stimulating game has a space

3890.88 --> 3896.88
version yeah it's ridiculous it's

3894.279 --> 3899.52
[ __ ] it's evil

3896.88 --> 3899.52
I don't give a

3900.2 --> 3905.3999999999996
[ __ ] but I do know that there is no

3902.72 --> 3908.279
video game in which you have a Non-Stop

3905.4 --> 3911.559
live transition scene from seeing a

3908.279 --> 3915.319
planet at a distance going towards it

3911.559 --> 3917.88
and then then that transitioning you

3915.319 --> 3920.2
like landing on it and it looking

3917.88 --> 3922.4
realistic yeah that doesn't exist

3920.2 --> 3925.839
there's no game in the freaking world

3922.4 --> 3929.1600000000003
that has ever done that why because it

3925.839 --> 3931.839
feels extremely

3929.16 --> 3935.0
unnatural Whenever there a oh you see a

3931.839 --> 3937.4
planet at a distance from your ship to

3935.0 --> 3939.4
oh you're going to go on the planet

3937.4 --> 3942.48
surface there's always a transition

3939.4 --> 3946.359
scene because if you did it in one go it

3942.48 --> 3948.119
would look extremely unnatural you would

3946.359 --> 3950.839
feel

3948.119 --> 3953.359
uncomfortable sitting through that

3950.839 --> 3955.64
people would likely walk away from the

3953.359 --> 3959.4
screen when they saw that because it

3955.64 --> 3963.319
feels un natural yeah that's why NASA

3959.4 --> 3963.319
also never does these kinds of

3964.839 --> 3971.44
shots right goes into high orbit you

3968.279 --> 3972.839
have some fish Island stuff and then oh

3971.44 --> 3976.559
it goes

3972.839 --> 3980.24
away away from the Earth surface

3976.559 --> 3982.799
supposedly claimed to be then they just

3980.24 --> 3986.3999999999996
wait a little bit until oh look Earth is

3982.799 --> 3988.559
in the distance now yeah they don't show

3986.4 --> 3991.799
you how it transitions from oh I'm

3988.559 --> 3993.2400000000002
seeing this sphere underneath me to like

3991.799 --> 3996.44
oh it goes away it's smaller it's

3993.24 --> 4001.16
smaller yeah you never see that there's

3996.44 --> 4003.319
no shot ever taken like that ever it

4001.16 --> 4006.8799999999997
doesn't

4003.319 --> 4010.48
exist because if you'd witness an

4006.88 --> 4014.4
attempt a forgery attempt like that you

4010.48 --> 4014.4
would feel this is

4014.52 --> 4019.199
unnatural

4016.09 --> 4019.199
[Music]

4021.76 --> 4028.119
it wouldn't feel natural yeah well it

4024.92 --> 4031.96
would but keep ning akumu virus just

4028.119 --> 4031.96
keep saying nah that that's

4044.52 --> 4050.92
fine oh okay J M I'm glad your mom's

4048.559 --> 4050.92

very

4122.46 --> 4126.479
[Music]

4133.319 --> 4142.0
handy which bad culture are you serious

4138.6 --> 4144.88
duper are you are you Ser you you have

4142.0 --> 4147.159
to ask that question why don't you take

4144.88 --> 4147.159000000001
a

4163.279 --> 4170.0
guess yeah yeah it is just you akumu

4165.96 --> 4170.0
virus it is just

4177.66 --> 4180.8099999999995
[Music]

4194.32 --> 4197.32
you

4199.56 --> 4202.56
forun

4202.92 --> 4206.8
what what are you talking about

4207.44 --> 4212.759999999999
C

4209.28 --> 4214.8
yes yeah yeah yeah but again there's no

4212.76 --> 4217.4400000000005
transition scenes

4214.8 --> 4219.400000000001
though I mean there is always yeah I'm

4217.44 --> 4222.12
not going to say it all

4219.4 --> 4224.04
again there's no game that does it where

4222.12 --> 4227.0
you like see the planet at a distance

4224.04 --> 4229.4
and you just live keep approaching it

4227.0 --> 4231.48
until suddenly you find yourself on the

4229.4 --> 4234.239
surface of the planet with your ship

4231.48 --> 4234.239
yeah that doesn't

4238.96 --> 4244.96
exist that that's where the argument

4241.32 --> 4244.96
ends it just it's not

4254.239 --> 4259.36
there

4256.52 --> 4259.360000000001
you just named

4273.04 --> 4277.28
one years oh

4279.52 --> 4285.92
okay I don't know exactly

atopy

5067.88 --> 5074.32

5070.8 --> 5077.0
feel that right away like about those

5074.32 --> 5081.5199999999995
games especially the popular ones is

5077.0 --> 5084.08
like people play it for the purpose of

5081.52 --> 5087.280000000001
atrophying their

5084.08 --> 5089.5199999999995
mind yeah that's the weirdest thing

5087.28 --> 5089.5199999999995
about

5090.08 --> 5096.239
it it's often why the Dumber the games

5093.639 --> 5100.92
the more po pop they

5096.239 --> 5100.919999999999
get people seek to do

5107.04 --> 5112.92
that right basically the principle no

5110.36 --> 5115.679
brain no pain kind of

5112.92 --> 5118.719
idea people do

5115.679 --> 5122.56
that I don't like those types of games I

5118.719 --> 5122.56
I play a whole different type of

5123.32 --> 5126.32
game

5128.08 --> 5131.8
not

5129.36 --> 5135.48
firsters based

5131.8 --> 5137.88
games mostly not live 3D games they just

5135.48 --> 5137.879999999999
don't do

5138.96 --> 5143.0
it I play older

5145.96 --> 5149.88
games more strategy

5153.239 --> 5156.239
oriented

5183.239 --> 5186.239
h

5192.639 --> 5197.96
CRA one of few games these days mod yeah

5196.76 --> 5200.08
although it depends on what you're going

5197.96 --> 5202.76
to do right if you're just like I'm

5200.08 --> 5205.4
bored I'm just going to screw

5202.76 --> 5207.8
around that will atrophy your mind but

5205.4 --> 5211.638999999999
if you have like oh I have a very I want

5207.8 --> 5211.639
to construct something

5211.679 --> 5217.0
specific then you're just you're doing

5215.56 --> 5220.0
it with a

5217.0 --> 5222.639
mission that can be stimulating it's

5220.0 --> 5225.639
like if you're using Minecraft for like

5222.639 --> 5225.639
designing

5227.239 --> 5230.239
something

5243.119 --> 5246.119
yeah

5256.8 --> 5264.4800000000005
oh what really

5261.239 --> 5267.199
thinking are you like one Eclipse passes

5264.48 --> 5270.678999999999
through six or seven cities named the

5267.199 --> 5270.678999999999
same that's

5273.119 --> 5276.119
crazy

5303.119 --> 5306.119
e

5312.44 --> 5319.119
soon this Eclipse when is this Eclipse

5315.0 --> 5322.56
about to happen I missed the

5319.119 --> 5322.5599999999995
date everybody

5325.119 --> 5330.28
talking some days it can barely get the

5327.84 --> 5333.04
chat the roll and now it's

5330.28 --> 5336.04
like April

5333.04 --> 5336.04
4th

5339.52 --> 5346.0
okay maybe something weird is going to

5342.76 --> 5348.4800000000005
happen this April I've been getting some

5346.0 --> 5350.76
really weird there's some weird videos

5348.48 --> 5353.28
out there talking about the freaking

5350.76 --> 5355.360000000001
Rapture like a lot of people now

5353.28 --> 5358.719
apparently think that the Rapture might

5355.36 --> 5358.719
be happening any moment

5359.159 --> 5363.0
now which is very

5363.04 --> 5368.76
odd like it's not odd that there are

5365.88 --> 5370.119
just general people that think that cuz

5368.76 --> 5372.52
they're like oh it could happen any

5370.119 --> 5376.4
moment could happen but like Sly like

5372.52 --> 5376.400000000001
sources that I wouldn't expect that

5376.44 --> 5382.119
from

5379.32 --> 5385.44
weird so maybe it'll happen and well if

5382.119 --> 5385.44
it happens I hope they take

5387.08 --> 5393.32
me even though I'm like one of those

5391.199 --> 5395.719
guys that doesn't actually believe Jesus

5393.32 --> 5399.0
Christ is God

5395.719 --> 5399.0
I still hope it'll take

5415.8 --> 5422.2390000000005
me bu that's

5419.239 --> 5422.239
not

5422.52 --> 5428.4800000000005
what who was accept Jesus oh I accept

5426.08 --> 5432.6
Jesus all right I just don't say think

5428.48 --> 5434.799999999999
he's God I think that that is a Priestly

5432.6 --> 5439.1990000000005
created lie I mean Jesus himself didn't

5434.8 --> 5441.92
even say that and whatever Christians

5439.199 --> 5444.5199999999995
believe about

5441.92 --> 5448.6
that Jesus didn't say

5444.52 --> 5449.719
that he said something kind of esoteric

5448.6 --> 5452.719
and not

5449.719 --> 5456.44
literal and like besides like why would

5452.719 --> 5458.32
he even say that it would be in conflict

5456.44 --> 5460.5599999999995
with

5458.32 --> 5464.48
the God's

5460.56 --> 5467.1990000000005
laws under which he was so to assume

5464.48 --> 5467.199
that he was is

5467.44 --> 5474.638999999999
ridiculous Jesus is not my

5471.0 --> 5474.639
savior he was a

5475.84 --> 5481.76
messiah great

5478.36 --> 5485.199
prophet revealer of the path of the

5481.76 --> 5488.88
purest path the Middle Road the way

5485.199 --> 5491.04
through the only true escape from the

5488.88 --> 5494.84
inevitable

5491.04 --> 5497.679
darkness of Lucifer and aramon of the

5494.84 --> 5499.6
devil he is and I absolutely believe

5497.679 --> 5502.6
that I believe that very to the core

5499.6 --> 5507.92
it's like I live it the technique that I

5502.6 --> 5507.92
use literally is based on that

5511.199 --> 5516.44
assumption all my spiritual

5514.48 --> 5519.48
symbols and things that I do all my

5516.44 --> 5521.36
esoterics is based on that it I can't

5519.48 --> 5524.718999999999
even call it assumption really or a

5521.36 --> 5526.04
belief it's just I know it I know I'm

5524.719 --> 5529.44
right in

5526.04 --> 5531.36
this and I will oppose like millions and

5529.44 --> 5533.5199999999995
millions of people that will agree

5531.36 --> 5536.36
disagree with me and even persecute me

5533.52 --> 5539.400000000001
or attack me or whatever they will

5536.36 --> 5542.239
do I know I'm right about

5539.4 --> 5545.32
this and I don't care if anybody

5542.239 --> 5548.759999999999
disagrees really I'm living

5545.32 --> 5551.759999999999
it but I don't know about the Rapture I

5548.76 --> 5551.76
mean

5555.32 --> 5560.32
like I don't think Jesus himself like

5558.28 --> 5563.159
mentioned anything about

5560.32 --> 5567.639
that but I might be wrong I don't know

5563.159 --> 5569.679
I'm not like a real Biblical scholar so

5567.639 --> 5571.1990000000005
I don't know maybe some of you want to

5569.679 --> 5576.4
argue that with

5571.199 --> 5576.4
me if you feel like it I'm open before

5578.36 --> 5584.0
it the Rapture happened April 15 tax day

5581.8 --> 5584.0
that's

5584.6 --> 5590.280000000001
hilarious he's not the Messiah he's a

5587.44 --> 5590.28
very naughty

5590.56 --> 5593.56
boy

5593.92 --> 5597.88
that's are there the there eclipses in

5597.159 --> 5600.879999999999
the

5597.88 --> 5600.88
Bible

5602.76 --> 5608.400000000001
uh

5605.28 --> 5612.5199999999995
he's not the Messiah he's a very naughty

5608.4 --> 5615.5199999999995
boy I love that from Life of

5612.52 --> 5615.52
Brin

5626.44 --> 5629.44
yeah

5630.119 --> 5635.719
what

5631.84 --> 5635.719
uh okay the

5638.48 --> 5644.599999999999
what and queing for biscuits I don't

5642.28 --> 5646.5199999999995
know if there's eclipses in the Bible I

5644.6 --> 5648.76
don't know if that's literally mentioned

5646.52 --> 5648.76
like

5650.199 --> 5654.5599999999995
that I don't remember it might

5659.8 --> 5664.719
be I mean Bible's a pretty big book and

5662.84 --> 5668.92
a lot of different types of things

5664.719 --> 5672.76
happen in it so there none

5668.92 --> 5672.76
okay not even the Old

5692.639 --> 5695.639
Testament

5705.119 --> 5708.239
Sun stops

5722.639 --> 5725.639
yeah

5734.92 --> 5741.159
Revis Standard Version okay that's cute

5737.96 --> 5744.2390000000005
thank you for that research you get what

5741.159 --> 5748.08
you give but uh how about the actual

5744.239 --> 5751.28
original Bible and not some new revised

5748.08 --> 5755.119
Standard Version I mean just

5751.28 --> 5758.5199999999995
literally the name new revised Standard

5755.119 --> 5761.04
Version or really so the rewrite of a

5758.52 --> 5763.76
rewrite of a rewrite identifies an

5761.04 --> 5766.96
eclipse how about the

5763.76 --> 5766.96
original you

5782.56 --> 5785.56
know

5788.48 --> 5793.48
what would be the Hebrew word for e

5790.6 --> 5796.92
gifts I don't know but maybe they don't

5793.48 --> 5801.0
have a word for it and they just

5796.92 --> 5804.04
describe it like oh this the sun is

5801.0 --> 5807.28
swallowed and then later spit out right

5804.04 --> 5811.48
I mean why would you need a word for it

5807.28 --> 5813.32
if you can just describe it right

5811.48 --> 5816.159
there's no word for it you describe it

5813.32 --> 5818.84
so the older things get the more things

5816.159 --> 5821.32
would be descriptive instead of having a

5818.84 --> 5821.32
word for

5823.84 --> 5831.04
it because over time people find

5827.04 --> 5835.0
specific words to

5831.04 --> 5836.32
describe specific things instead of just

5835.0 --> 5838.92
using a

5836.32 --> 5842.5199999999995
description that's how it works language

5838.92 --> 5845.52
just gets more specific over

5842.52 --> 5845.52
time

5848.159 --> 5851.92
yeah exactly debatable d That's what I

5852.48 --> 5859.5199999999995
mean I mean I could imagine like oh it

5856.199 --> 5859.5199999999995
and then the sun got

5859.639 --> 5868.159000000001
swallowed and we see a ring of fire or

5864.199 --> 5871.28
something and then the sun gets spit out

5868.159 --> 5874.719
again like that would be roughly how I'd

5871.28 --> 5876.36
imagine that would be described

5874.719 --> 5879.28
but I don't know I don't know if it's

5876.36 --> 5882.36
actually in the Bible

5879.28 --> 5885.92
anywhere did they have

5882.36 --> 5888.92
eclipses the Old Testament was new kind

5885.92 --> 5893.1990000000005
of a question is that

5888.92 --> 5896.119
uh yeah I mean logically throbbing

5893.199 --> 5897.879999999999
banana there would have been eclipses

5896.119 --> 5900.48
since the beginning of time since there

5897.88 --> 5905.4400000000005
were celestial bodies and a sun there

5900.48 --> 5905.44
would have logically been eclipses

5925.36 --> 5931.44
hey Richard G yeah

5927.239 --> 5931.44
thanks I know I thought that was great

5932.44 --> 5935.44
too

5951.03 --> 5954.219999999999
[Music]

5962.36 --> 5965.36
that's

5965.56 --> 5971.2390000000005
why why do you say that Cleary why would

5968.0 --> 5972.4
it the sun eclipse be a bad sign for non

5971.239 --> 5977.638999999999
Jewish

5972.4 --> 5977.638999999999
World explain that to me I don't get

5990.44 --> 5995.32
it is he a real for Eclipse oh

5997.48 --> 6002.678999999999
really didn't show up yes I know it's

6000.48 --> 6005.44
kind of weird he said he had like an

6002.679 --> 6005.4400000000005
operation

6006.679 --> 6010.88
though I think that's probably the

6008.84 --> 6012.28
reason why he hasn't shown up I hope

6010.88 --> 6015.119
everything went all

6012.28 --> 6018.8
right cuz if I remember correctly he had

6015.119 --> 6018.799999999999
like a back operation or

6019.639 --> 6028.1990000000005
something so that might be the reason he

6022.92 --> 6030.36
hasn't show shown up I really I should

6028.199 --> 6034.159
probably check

6030.36 --> 6034.159
him maybe apply the

6044.39 --> 6047.609
[Music]

6048.239 --> 6056.598999999999
technique why do pagans get such a bad

6051.639 --> 6056.599
rep because they don't abide by the

6062.04 --> 6068.96
priesthood right I

6064.639 --> 6071.679
mean Pagan is like oh so you have your

6068.96 --> 6073.119
own ideas that might be very old or

6071.679 --> 6076.32
whatever old

6073.119 --> 6079.719
traditions and a pagan is not even like

6076.32 --> 6082.239
oh I hate Jesus like he's not this he's

6079.719 --> 6085.2390000000005
not that

6082.239 --> 6085.239
right

6085.32 --> 6090.36
it's just like oh you don't accept the

6088.08 --> 6092.239
priesthood as your Authority that they

6090.36 --> 6095.799999999999
will tell you exactly how it is because

6092.239 --> 6100.5599999999995
they're a priest well then you're a

6095.8 --> 6100.56
pagan or a heathen

6102.159 --> 6107.799999999999
right and like

6105.119 --> 6111.44
Christians typical Priestly

6107.8 --> 6114.4800000000005
Christians always like [ __ ] all over

6111.44 --> 6116.719
pagans and like us assume oh yeah but

6114.48 --> 6120.598999999999
they are like doing human sacrifice and

6116.719 --> 6122.28
blah blah blah it's it's so nonsensical

6120.599 --> 6126.32
I

6122.28 --> 6129.159
mean no paganism does not just per

6126.32 --> 6132.639
default have that at all I

6129.159 --> 6135.32
mean they're probably branches of

6132.639 --> 6137.159000000001
deranged evil people that consider

6135.32 --> 6140.36
themselves Pagan that do that sort of

6137.159 --> 6143.4
thing but I mean it's kind of obvious

6140.36 --> 6147.199
that they're satanic that they're like

6143.4 --> 6150.879999999999
sacrificing to a non- good or to a

6147.199 --> 6153.678999999999
little G to some entity then so they're

6150.88 --> 6156.56
effectively Satanist like under the

6153.679 --> 6156.56
culture of

6157.44 --> 6163.96
paganism Pagan means farmer where she oh

6172.119 --> 6175.119
huh

6186.48 --> 6196.638999999999
but yeah I mean I am

6190.719 --> 6199.88
a Jesus following Pagan I'm a Christian

6196.639 --> 6205.119
Pagan because because it's paradoxical

6199.88 --> 6205.119
so I'll do that right

6207.719 --> 6210.76
I I'm just like

6222.56 --> 6228.52
that right I'm just typically like that

6225.4 --> 6232.28
is like my way of doing things

6228.52 --> 6233.719
it's are the Christians Wizards what are

6232.28 --> 6236.8
there Christian

6233.719 --> 6238.88
Wizards uh that depends on how you

6236.8 --> 6243.76
define

6238.88 --> 6245.599
wizard if you define wizard as somebody

6243.76 --> 6248.4400000000005
who

6245.599 --> 6250.400000000001
like focuses a lot in their life on

6248.44 --> 6253.08
attaining knowledge especially

6250.4 --> 6253.08
complicated

6253.119 --> 6257.5199999999995
knowledge then yes they're Christian

6261.239 --> 6266.199
wizards but it also depends on how you

6264.04 --> 6268.679
define Christian is Christian like oh

6266.199 --> 6272.0
you have to say the riddle exactly it's

6268.679 --> 6274.679
like oh If you deny that Jesus Christ is

6272.0 --> 6276.32
God you're not a Christian yeah well in

6274.679 --> 6278.679
that case then they're not Christian

6276.32 --> 6280.759999999999
Wizards so it all depends on like really

6278.679 --> 6283.4800000000005
how you define Christian and how you

6280.76 --> 6286.4800000000005
define wizard if you define Christian as

6283.48 --> 6290.119
in oh you have to be that very specific

6286.48 --> 6292.119
riddle chanting nonsensical

6290.119 --> 6294.679
cultist then there's no Christian

6292.119 --> 6297.92
Wizards if you define wizard as oh

6294.679 --> 6300.4
that's somebody who lies and

6297.92 --> 6303.56
deceives then there isn't a Christian

6300.4 --> 6304.92
wizard but if you don't do either then

6303.56 --> 6307.96
there could

6304.92 --> 6310.4
be if you define Christian as somebody

6307.96 --> 6312.92
that follows the wisdom of Christ and

6310.4 --> 6315.199
revers them as the Messiah and the

6312.92 --> 6316.679
revealer of that great knowledge of

6315.199 --> 6319.879999999999
light and

6316.679 --> 6323.04
God and if you consider Wizardry as

6319.88 --> 6326.92
somebody who collects knowledge and like

6323.04 --> 6330.0
cherishes it above physical

6326.92 --> 6331.92
wealth then yes there can be a Christian

6330.0 --> 6336.52
Wizard and I would be one of

6331.92 --> 6336.52
them because I do those things

6341.719 --> 6347.92
both cast spells okay yeah well that's

6345.32 --> 6350.199
the gaming type of defin but I mean what

6347.92 --> 6354.4
is casting a spell you

6350.199 --> 6356.44
know casting a spell is

6354.4 --> 6359.48
saying words that have

6356.44 --> 6362.96
influence it's l like

6359.48 --> 6367.32
spelling casting a spell would be

6362.96 --> 6370.679
throwing out words that have an

6367.32 --> 6374.32
influence like I cast spells all the

6370.679 --> 6377.88
time I say things and I say them in a

6374.32 --> 6380.5199999999995
way that changes potentially the way you

6377.88 --> 6385.119
think about things that's literally

6380.52 --> 6388.4800000000005
casting spells my spells are changing

6385.119 --> 6390.4
things changing your mind make you

6388.48 --> 6392.48
realize things that change your

6390.4 --> 6394.839999999999
perspective on everything or at least I

6392.48 --> 6394.839999999999
attempt

6398.26 --> 6404.0
[Music]

6399.76 --> 6406.56
to wow that's that's interesting what

6404.0 --> 6406.56
you said there

6410.4 --> 6416.119
LSG simply moving intention along a

6413.76 --> 6419.159000000001
Continuum from impossibility to

6416.119 --> 6422.44
inevitably by bringing together as many

6419.159 --> 6422.44
correspondences as

6425.119 --> 6431.96
possible you can speak things into

6429.159 --> 6433.759999999999
existence now you can change the course

6431.96 --> 6436.88
of actions of

6433.76 --> 6439.4800000000005
people by telling them

6436.88 --> 6442.639
things one of the most important things

6439.48 --> 6443.44
being showing people how they've Li how

6442.639 --> 6447.8
they're

6443.44 --> 6447.799999999999
believing in a lie proving it to

6448.639 --> 6454.679
them because doing that snaps a person

6451.88 --> 6456.56
out of the LIE out of the demon that

6454.679 --> 6460.719
basically controls them steers their

6456.56 --> 6466.119000000001
actions through the LIE ref frees them

6460.719 --> 6466.119
from that lie and then their actions

6471.84 --> 6474.84
change

6484.159 --> 6490.32
Inception was a movie about

6486.679 --> 6490.32
magicians yeah in a

6490.639 --> 6494.639
way Dream Magic

6500.88 --> 6506.04
right yeah yeah yeah do I know you want

6503.239 --> 6506.04
to do a lot of

6511.56 --> 6517.639
things I'm surprised you even have time

6514.08 --> 6520.84
to do any of that weren't you like

6517.639 --> 6523.4800000000005
having a new job that's all classified

6520.84 --> 6526.4800000000005
where the hell are you having time left

6523.48 --> 6529.08
to learn programming and doing all that

6526.48 --> 6531.718999999999
I'm wondering duper or did you already

6529.08 --> 6534.719
get fired after a

6531.719 --> 6534.719
week

6561.719 --> 6564.719
oh

6575.88 --> 6581.4400000000005
could Jesuit priests be considered

6578.4 --> 6583.799999999999
Wizards illusionists

6581.44 --> 6587.239
yes evil

6583.8 --> 6589.88
wizards yeah a wizard that creates

6587.239 --> 6593.32
crafts sophisticated

6589.88 --> 6598.6
lies that's evil and that's what the

6593.32 --> 6601.599
Jesuits did they used math to create

6598.6 --> 6606.2390000000005
[Music]

6601.599 --> 6609.599
lies to flip reality inside out and

6606.239 --> 6609.598999999999
we're all stuck with it ever

6610.159 --> 6616.96
since right those possessed by ball lie

6613.8 --> 6620.360000000001
Devils we can thank the Catholics the

6616.96 --> 6624.88
Jesuits for that yeah they created the

6620.36 --> 6624.88
ball lie Devils with their math Ma

6626.599 --> 6632.84
matics how do you use math for lies well

6629.92 --> 6637.119
you can prove things with math that are

6632.84 --> 6637.119000000001
practically impossible that's how you do

6638.4 --> 6646.719
it are magicians who do tricks just

6643.719 --> 6646.719
illusionists

6648.56 --> 6654.639
yeah does that make them

6651.639 --> 6654.639
evil

6656.04 --> 6658.36
not

6658.52 --> 6662.92
necessarily I mean they're just doing it

6660.679 --> 6662.92
for

6664.4 --> 6670.5199999999995
entertainment right the real evil

6666.88 --> 6672.04
magicians they create Illusions and then

6670.52 --> 6675.96
tell you it's

6672.04 --> 6678.159
real that's evil that's when you claim

6675.96 --> 6680.159
the LIE is the truth that is evil if

6678.159 --> 6682.04
you're just playing a trick on somebody

6680.159 --> 6683.679
it's just playing a trick it's like

6682.04 --> 6685.76
entertaining

6683.679 --> 6687.639
and they always say look this is Magic

6685.76 --> 6689.1990000000005
it's not actually

6687.639 --> 6691.719
real

6689.199 --> 6694.28
like they say

6691.719 --> 6696.4
that like they have to or something it's

6694.28 --> 6698.759999999999
part of that being a

6696.4 --> 6701.4
magician but The Magicians are open

6698.76 --> 6701.400000000001
about it is

6702.119 --> 6708.719
trickery Wizards turn people into

6706.48 --> 6711.5199999999995
FS I don't

6708.719 --> 6714.52
know that

6711.52 --> 6714.52
uh

6716.079 --> 6719.679
no pretty much

6720.639 --> 6725.079
no I mean if there's anything like that

6723.56 --> 6727.84
it it's more like

6725.079 --> 6730.119
transmutation and I've had ideas about

6727.84 --> 6734.32
it that people said like oh I turned

6730.119 --> 6735.719
into a n i got better right again life

6734.32 --> 6738.239
of brine

6735.719 --> 6743.079
reference uh oh wait no that's actually

6738.239 --> 6745.5199999999995
it montii holy Grill but there's a good

6743.079 --> 6749.04
chance that when that happens and people

6745.52 --> 6750.84
say like oh I was turned into an animal

6749.04 --> 6753.56
they basically got a

6750.84 --> 6757.1990000000005
hallucinogen and were then

6753.56 --> 6760.599
like commanded to believe to be an

6757.199 --> 6762.678999999999
animal so they're like really they're

6760.599 --> 6764.76
like possessed by a spirit of an animal

6762.679 --> 6768.1990000000005
and then they feel like they are that

6764.76 --> 6770.76
animal and they might see it like they

6768.199 --> 6774.239
would only be the ones to see themselves

6770.76 --> 6777.52
as the animal well well the witch is

6774.239 --> 6779.718999999999
basically just seeing them as the person

6777.52 --> 6782.96
they are thinking that they're that

6779.719 --> 6785.88
animal right that's a very logical

6782.96 --> 6788.52
possibility with a lot of transmutations

6785.88 --> 6789.679
it's like it just makes you believe that

6788.52 --> 6792.719
full

6789.679 --> 6794.88
heartedly and hallucinated like you will

6792.719 --> 6797.2390000000005
see like you're an animal but in the

6794.88 --> 6799.52
physical reality outside of

6797.239 --> 6803.119
hallucination you're still a

6799.52 --> 6805.4400000000005
person physically right this mysteries

6803.119 --> 6809.239
about this we don't exactly

6805.44 --> 6811.598999999999
know I think the the chances of actual

6809.239 --> 6814.959999999999
literal physical transmutation like that

6811.599 --> 6821.119000000001
is extremely

6814.96 --> 6821.119
obscure and not provable at this

6822.76 --> 6828.719
point this I don't know debatable I'm

6825.719 --> 6828.719
not interested in

6831.44 --> 6834.44
magicians

6838.96 --> 6842.159
spirit animals that's

6854.4 --> 6857.92
different

6855.41 --> 6860.719
[Music]

6857.92 --> 6864.36
okay how the hell is this subject

6860.719 --> 6864.36
happening here this weird

6870.92 --> 6875.8
clock oh

6872.96 --> 6877.32
yeah man that's but that guy's like from

6875.8 --> 6880.0
the

6877.32 --> 6882.679
80s he's kind of old now if he's still

6880.0 --> 6882.679
there I don't

6891.32 --> 6894.32
know

6928.679 --> 6933.96
hope you're all enjoying the show seems

6930.48 --> 6938.159
to be going pretty fluid thus

6933.96 --> 6942.56
far internet disconnections or anything

6938.159 --> 6942.5599999999995
and the chat is rolling

6951.239 --> 6954.239
by

6993.92 --> 6997.4800000000005
yeah I agree seeking sty it it's been

7011.239 --> 7014.239
good

7017.76 --> 7020.9890000000005
[Music]

7021.84 --> 7027.639
hot copy with the what are you talking

7024.639 --> 7027.639
about

7032.77 --> 7041.159000000001
[Music]

7035.159 --> 7044.159
no uh okay duper no I look just fine in

7041.159 --> 7044.159
photos

7055.88 --> 7059.169
[Music]

7071.239 --> 7076.678999999999
oh bur in your throat and

7073.679 --> 7076.679
never

7091.8 --> 7098.4800000000005
right maybe you're just

7094.639 --> 7098.4800000000005
overreacting maybe you're just

7101.119 --> 7104.119
young

7110.36 --> 7117.159
apart from the healing what else do you

7112.96 --> 7120.04
use your Wizardry to do healing has

7117.159 --> 7122.598999999999
that's not part of Wizardry

7120.04 --> 7126.58
although maybe it

7122.599 --> 7127.88
is it's just it's just a

7126.58 --> 7131.5199999999995
[Music]

7127.88 --> 7135.36
technique I mean how I consider Wizardry

7131.52 --> 7138.599
is the knowledge Focus it's about

7135.36 --> 7140.92
learning how to do things that are that

7138.599 --> 7144.32
people don't believe as is

7140.92 --> 7147.4800000000005
real so Flat Earth kind of falls under

7144.32 --> 7149.679
that the Flat Earth lore it's like I

7147.48 --> 7153.759999999999
like to collect

7149.679 --> 7157.599
lore that's what in my version of wizard

7153.76 --> 7158.88
does spellcasting is just like basically

7157.599 --> 7162.360000000001
just sharing the

7158.88 --> 7165.159000000001
knowledge right so I find I consider

7162.36 --> 7166.28
like the knowledge that hey viruses

7165.159 --> 7170.5599999999995
don't

7166.28 --> 7172.599
exist that that is Wizardry that is like

7170.56 --> 7176.8
a piece of knowledge that people were

7172.599 --> 7180.360000000001
like what what do you mean what right or

7176.8 --> 7184.84
the Earth is flat what are you talking

7180.36 --> 7187.839999999999
about but also in content like why to

7184.84 --> 7191.639
back it to to build it

7187.84 --> 7193.88
to uh to have a foundation for these for

7191.639 --> 7196.4800000000005
that

7193.88 --> 7200.400000000001
statement knowing

7196.48 --> 7206.28
obscure things that are

7200.4 --> 7209.079
impactful I consider knowledge about how

7206.28 --> 7212.92
Christianity the priesthood has

7209.079 --> 7215.119
encapsulated and captured Jesus and

7212.92 --> 7218.76
basically tells everybody the wrong

7215.119 --> 7222.48
things about him I consider that to be a

7218.76 --> 7224.719
piece of Wizardry it's knowledge that is

7222.48 --> 7227.919999999999
not just readily

7224.719 --> 7231.84
available like you have to figure it

7227.92 --> 7234.4400000000005
out you have to find out you have to

7231.84 --> 7236.8
like go through some difficult

7234.44 --> 7239.759999999999
considerations and realizations to get

7236.8 --> 7242.320000000001
there that's what I consider

7239.76 --> 7244.56
Wizardry you will become comfortable

7242.32 --> 7247.239
with your ugliness by the time you're 40

7244.56 --> 7247.2390000000005
that's hilarious

7250.92 --> 7253.92
LSG

7263.32 --> 7268.159
can wizards live

7265.159 --> 7268.159
longer

7268.239 --> 7275.678999999999
yeah you get knowledge

7272.239 --> 7280.44
of how food really

7275.679 --> 7286.079
works right so knowing like hey that the

7280.44 --> 7289.5599999999995
standard recogniz food pyramid is total

7286.079 --> 7292.239
nonsense and the doctor is doesn't

7289.56 --> 7294.360000000001
really you shouldn't he ask the doctor

7292.239 --> 7296.638999999999
for health advice that I consider that

7294.36 --> 7299.0
to be Wizardry it's not common

7296.639 --> 7302.2390000000005
knowledge and that will help you live

7299.0 --> 7304.199
longer but on the other hand if you have

7302.239 --> 7306.0
that knowledge then you are basically

7304.199 --> 7308.5199999999995
competing with the demons that are in

7306.0 --> 7312.84
things for the money and the control and

7308.52 --> 7316.040000000001
then you risk their wrath so

7312.84 --> 7318.599
you could live longer but you'd have to

7316.04 --> 7318.599
be very

7321.48 --> 7324.759999999999
careful in

7326.0 --> 7334.0
ways because having such

7329.76 --> 7334.0
knowledge aggravates

7337.159 --> 7343.759999999999
demons and yeah that is knowledge that

7340.679 --> 7347.0
also Jesus himself self like very much

7343.76 --> 7347.0
was about all

7347.32 --> 7351.679
that they don't get the [ __ ]

7352.0 --> 7358.28
out all right I'll be right

7355.28 --> 7358.28
back

7370.84 --> 7373.84
break

7400.76 --> 7403.76
e

7430.159 --> 7434.719
when you live in the moment you are

7431.8 --> 7434.719
Immortal

7447.4 --> 7451.239
okay welcome back Ben

7460.719 --> 7463.719
Johnson

7470.96 --> 7479.04
it's just constant flow of wind

7474.96 --> 7479.04
and it's kind of annoying in

7490.639 --> 7493.639
ways

7520.96 --> 7526.0
so

7522.92 --> 7526.0
what no I

7534.8 --> 7538.559
haven't the word about

7544.8 --> 7551.04
Fe well Richard G maybe he should hold

7548.159 --> 7556.598999999999
off on that for a while until he like

7551.04 --> 7556.599
figures out how things work over

7558.4 --> 7562.92
there right it might not be

7568.159 --> 7574.759999999999
appreciated wasn't space force trying to

7570.639 --> 7574.76
get Arwin shut down

7579.32 --> 7585.799999999999
maybe my argument was basically that

7581.88 --> 7587.96
space force might be part of

7585.8 --> 7591.400000000001
a money

7587.96 --> 7593.079
program ter alert is it or it could be

7591.4 --> 7595.36
whatever I'm kicking him out with this

7593.079 --> 7596.32
[ __ ] rainbow Flack you [ __ ] [ __ ]

7595.36 --> 7600.159
[ __ ]

7596.32 --> 7603.5199999999995
you right but yeah space force might be

7600.159 --> 7605.719
having money to basically try to bully

7603.52 --> 7609.040000000001
away flat earthers they might have money

7605.719 --> 7613.52
available for that which would explain

7609.04 --> 7616.48
why there's so much trolls

7613.52 --> 7620.52
now after

7616.48 --> 7622.4
2016 like way more than before that CU

7620.52 --> 7626.0
there's always been ballards that get

7622.4 --> 7629.4
agitated and all that but I mean like

7626.0 --> 7631.32
entire trolling forums that focus on

7629.4 --> 7635.558999999999
singular

7631.32 --> 7637.759999999999
channels it's a little far seems like

7635.559 --> 7640.88
what are these people

7637.76 --> 7643.52
doing like how do they have the time for

7640.88 --> 7643.52
that kind of crap

7645.639 --> 7648.2390000000005
right that's

7670.44 --> 7673.44
suspicious

7700.44 --> 7703.44
h

7721.0 --> 7726.84
Auto biscuit are you the same autovon

7724.159 --> 7729.199
biscuit that's over at Owen Benjamin's

7726.84 --> 7729.1990000000005
in

7729.44 --> 7734.48
chat that's like super allergic to

7732.4 --> 7738.28
things I say always have to like [ __ ]

7734.48 --> 7744.48
all over the chat there when I might

7738.28 --> 7744.48
have some silly or silly adjacent

7745.239 --> 7749.759999999999
remarks cuz that is also called

7749.92 --> 7753.84
Auto even Auto from

7757.239 --> 7765.239
biscuit talking about oh

7760.119 --> 7767.92
Benjamin yet this whole Bagel Earth in

7765.239 --> 7770.718999999999
the title yday I haven't even the the

7767.92 --> 7772.679
stream was so choppy yesterday I could

7770.719 --> 7775.84
barely watch

7772.679 --> 7778.599
it so I'm going to like watch it again

7775.84 --> 7780.84
today I've already watch the part

7778.599 --> 7782.119000000001
because it just life was just undo was

7780.84 --> 7784.52
not

7782.119 --> 7788.119
doable and the first half I was on the

7784.52 --> 7788.119000000001
phone with my friend from M

7790.32 --> 7793.32
anyway

7795.4 --> 7801.36
yes Richard G it is it really is it's

7819.92 --> 7825.04
dramatic but I'm going glad there's also

7823.04 --> 7828.36
people that are willing to stand against

7825.04 --> 7830.84
it a lot of a lot of who are in the chat

7828.36 --> 7832.92
these days and I'm very happy about

7830.84 --> 7836.1990000000005
it and I'm

7832.92 --> 7839.4
glad that I'm just much more a capable

7836.199 --> 7845.558999999999
of actually figuring out who's just a

7839.4 --> 7849.0
complete troll infiltrate lie liar

7845.559 --> 7852.119000000001
bullshitter that could talk about their

7849.0 --> 7855.239
life in the most incoherent way of ever

7852.119 --> 7857.92
seen like yeah I'm spotting that

7855.239 --> 7861.119
[ __ ] and I'm like spotting that pretty

7857.92 --> 7866.4800000000005
much from day one I just kind of let it

7861.119 --> 7868.719
roll to see like if it is consistently

7866.48 --> 7870.879999999999
inconsistent or if it's somebody that

7868.719 --> 7872.4
just has weird mood swings or something

7870.88 --> 7875.4800000000005
because that's happened too where people

7872.4 --> 7877.199
are like oh just great and then one day

7875.48 --> 7879.959999999999
they're like completely incoherent like

7877.199 --> 7883.239
they're on some hallucina or something

7879.96 --> 7883.2390000000005
because that's happened too

7883.599 --> 7886.84
people show up drunk all of a sudden get

7885.559 --> 7891.719
really

7886.84 --> 7893.84
weird right so I just let them roll out

7891.719 --> 7895.599
their act and see how consistently

7893.84 --> 7900.559
inconsistent they

7895.599 --> 7903.079
are and then when I'm satisfied like oh

7900.559 --> 7905.4800000000005
yep there's nothing else to this then I

7903.079 --> 7908.239
kick him out I call him out on the lies

7905.48 --> 7908.239
and then I kick him

7910.239 --> 7913.239
out

7914.4 --> 7917.679
what are you talking about D

7918.199 --> 7925.48
Rons see those swear

7921.4 --> 7928.239
words that I'm getting you don't get a

7925.48 --> 7931.638999999999
strike for those swear

7928.239 --> 7931.638999999999
words it's

7940.159 --> 7943.159
nonsense

7949.599 --> 7956.639
yeah this just generalized swear

7954.48 --> 7959.759999999999
words why do you why the hell do you

7956.639 --> 7962.400000000001
even say that duper why the [ __ ] are you

7959.76 --> 7962.400000000001
bringing that

7966.84 --> 7973.119000000001
up and how is that

7969.48 --> 7973.119
impressive oh didn't know

7973.639 --> 7978.639
that what did you see somebody else

7976.559 --> 7981.4400000000005
saying that word oh their stream got

7978.639 --> 7983.1990000000005
taken down where are you even getting

7981.44 --> 7987.0
that idea from

7983.199 --> 7989.598999999999
duper where where do you get that idea

7987.0 --> 7993.599
from cuz as far as I

7989.599 --> 7996.400000000001
know it only works if you like Target an

7993.599 --> 7998.28
individual that's out in the open like

7996.4 --> 8000.799999999999
if there's some guy that happens to be

7998.28 --> 8002.759999999999
gay and they're like and they're having

8000.8 --> 8005.559
extrem and they're like being gay yeah

8002.76 --> 8007.639
if I to start attacking them like

8005.559 --> 8011.360000000001
[ __ ] yeah that's

8007.639 --> 8013.36
like that I could get a strike for that

8011.36 --> 8015.558999999999
that's logical it's an actual individual

8013.36 --> 8017.719
that is like

8015.559 --> 8021.04
homosexual and then I'd

8017.719 --> 8023.52
be attacking them verbally well that's

8021.04 --> 8026.599
not what I

8023.52 --> 8029.4800000000005
do a lot of YouTubers beep out swear

8026.599 --> 8032.679
words so I assume that yeah you know why

8029.48 --> 8037.36
they do that duper you know

8032.679 --> 8037.36
why to avoid

8037.76 --> 8046.599
demonetization not to avoid

8041.48 --> 8046.598999999999
strikes you don't get a strike for

8055.92 --> 8063.04
that I mean if that's all you talk about

8059.159 --> 8063.04
you might get a strike eventually

8085.679 --> 8089.639
yeah many YouTube creators who think

8087.639 --> 8092.84
yeah they think I don't

8089.639 --> 8094.92
know like I I try to not swear as much

8092.84 --> 8097.679
as I can and all that but I mean if

8094.92 --> 8100.52
there's literal trolls that are just

8097.679 --> 8102.4400000000005
continually nagging me then eventually I

8100.52 --> 8105.599
will start to

8102.44 --> 8109.28
swear it just

8105.599 --> 8109.28
happens I'm very

8112.4 --> 8117.48
sorry very sorry to those Fain of Hearts

8115.44 --> 8120.719
but seriously if you are Fain of heart

8117.48 --> 8122.598999999999
what the hell are you even doing here

8120.719 --> 8125.639
like what the hell are you doing at a

8122.599 --> 8129.32
stream like mine yeah the early bird

8125.639 --> 8134.400000000001
show is not for the Fain of heart not

8129.32 --> 8136.799999999999
for those oh no oh I need to be talked

8134.4 --> 8139.759999999999
like I need my pronouns to be respected

8136.8 --> 8143.0
oh I can't oh that hurts me like what

8139.76 --> 8143.0
the hell are you doing

8144.159 --> 8149.92
here this stream's not for the F of

8146.8 --> 8152.92
heart and that's a

8149.92 --> 8152.92
fact

8153.09 --> 8156.169
[Music]

8160.88 --> 8167.400000000001
yeah and I'm already demonetized so I

8163.079 --> 8167.4
don't care I don't

8167.52 --> 8172.040000000001
care I never got anything out of it

8173.04 --> 8179.44
anyway seriously I don't get anything

8175.76 --> 8182.4800000000005
out of it you got it there's no point in

8179.44 --> 8184.5199999999995
me oh oh I need to to really not say

8182.48 --> 8187.239
these words because I might not get

8184.52 --> 8192.679
money that literally I don't have any

8187.239 --> 8194.479
money out of I might lose my 20 cents a

8192.679 --> 8196.679
month oh

8194.479 --> 8200.559
no screw

8196.679 --> 8203.399
that yeah I talk how I

8200.559 --> 8205.358999999999
talk I'm already trying to hold back I

8203.399 --> 8207.599
could be a lot worse as I have in the

8205.359 --> 8212.84
past I can get really freaking foul

8207.599 --> 8212.84

words holding power over people is a

8378.84 --> 8384.880000000001
spell yeah well it's only going to have

8381.88 --> 8388.0
power over them if those people accept

8384.88 --> 8392.358999999999
that it has power over them yeah

8388.0 --> 8394.319
nobody's forced to watch My Stream

8392.359 --> 8397.2
if you think you're forced to watch My

8394.319 --> 8401.16
Stream you're either somehow being paid

8397.2 --> 8405.960000000001
to do that which is extremely

8401.16 --> 8409.0
suspicious right or you're just

[Music]

8562.91 --> 8566.2
[Music]

8569.439 --> 8573.04
watching

8571.16 --> 8575.96
right I mean there's a good reason why

8573.04 --> 8580.04
at the beginning of my stream I say

8575.96 --> 8582.519999999999
share on any platform you deem fit not

8580.04 --> 8584.76
just share on any and every platform I

8582.52 --> 8587.880000000001
don't say that I said any platform you

8584.76 --> 8590.68
deem fit that means in a place where you

8587.88 --> 8595.679999999998
think people can handle what I

8590.68 --> 8600.08
do yeah that means not

8595.68 --> 8603.04
the the parent the parent Skype group or

8600.08 --> 8605.24
something or the the parent WhatsApp

8603.04 --> 8608.319000000001
group for

8605.24 --> 8610.76
kindergarteners yeah that's not the

8608.319 --> 8613.439
place you should be dumping the Flat

8610.76 --> 8616.2
Earth early bird show link you

8613.439 --> 8619.68
understand it's not meant for

8616.2 --> 8620.84
them my stream is specifically for 12

8619.68 --> 8624.479000000001
years and

8620.84 --> 8626.08
older and not for the Fain of heart if

8624.479 --> 8628.84
you're really over sensitive and you

8626.08 --> 8631.74
have mental problems dealing with people

8628.84 --> 8634.819
with emotions and all this is is not for

8631.74 --> 8634.819
[Music]

8646.319 --> 8651.84
you

8647.84 --> 8657.76
right this is basically meant for

8651.84 --> 8661.12
adults or younger people that are

8657.76 --> 8662.84
tough younger people that that already

8661.12 --> 8665.04
have

8662.84 --> 8667.279
like that are homeschooled that are

8665.04 --> 8670.279
taught by their parents to be tough and

8667.279 --> 8671.08
to realize that Society is full of lies

8670.279 --> 8673.92
and

8671.08 --> 8676.439
manipulation yeah if you have that kind

8673.92 --> 8678.64
of background teaching from your parents

8676.439 --> 8680.399
you're already very aware and you're

8678.64 --> 8683.64
like looking for a challenge how to

8680.399 --> 8685.76
figure things out then this show is for

8683.64 --> 8689.72
you 12 years

8685.76 --> 8691.64
plus yeah if you're like a general

8689.72 --> 8693.0
person that just goes to a general

8691.64 --> 8696.64
school and

8693.0 --> 8701.0
has all the sjw education and all that

8696.64 --> 8704.92
and pronoun this is not for you you need

8701.0 --> 8704.92
to leave for your own

8705.04 --> 8709.68
well-being you're going to end up

8707.52 --> 8713.2
emotionally

8709.68 --> 8717.720000000001
distraught so don't watch this

8713.2 --> 8720.800000000001
then because I do say things that may

8717.72 --> 8725.199999999999
hurt people's feelings if they're very

8720.8 --> 8728.438999999998
sensitive to these subjects and to

8725.2 --> 8731.240000000002
swearing right #

8728.439 --> 8732.64
intolerance it's in the hashtag list for

8731.24 --> 8735.64
a

8732.64 --> 8735.64
reason

8736.68 --> 8744.880000000001
okay that that should ring some

8741.0 --> 8746.16
Bells also execute Marxist revolutionary

8744.88 --> 8749.24
should

8746.16 --> 8751.439
like those descriptions like you should

8749.24 --> 8753.68
be warned

8751.439 --> 8757.479000000001
this is not for the Fain of

8753.68 --> 8760.720000000001
heart yeah I also talk about my own

8757.479 --> 8763.8
psychological issue sometimes like how I

8760.72 --> 8765.84
can have like nightmarish things if

8763.8 --> 8767.84
you're really sensitive then that kind

8765.84 --> 8771.2
of thing might really creep you out or

8767.84 --> 8773.68
even trigger a panic attack or

8771.2 --> 8777.279
something if if that's the case you need

8773.68 --> 8777.279
to be careful you need to be

8777.6 --> 8786.279
prepared right you need to be aware

8780.8 --> 8786.278999999999
that this is not a universal safe

8787.12 --> 8790.439
space it's

8798.56 --> 8804.439
not right and I

8801.24 --> 8807.16
mean if you're like a little

8804.439 --> 8811.24
kid and you're like pretty

8807.16 --> 8815.8
smart then I'd say under some par Al

8811.24 --> 8818.52
guidance you might like below 12 yeah

8815.8 --> 8821.88
I'm not saying like never ever watch it

8818.52 --> 8825.640000000001
but it is meant for 12 plus so if you

8821.88 --> 8828.679999999998
want to watch it or whatever I very much

8825.64 --> 8828.68
advise Parental

8829.439 --> 8832.439
Guidance

8833.2 --> 8838.84
yeah this is not a show you should like

8835.68 --> 8842.64
have an 8-year-old just sit there

8838.84 --> 8848.319
watch without anybody looking with you

8842.64 --> 8852.039999999999
because it's I'm not thinking of little

8848.319 --> 8854.56
children when I do this show it's not my

8852.04 --> 8858.960000000001
target

8854.56 --> 8858.96
audience my target audience

8860.319 --> 8867.16
is late

8862.6 --> 8870.56
teens young adults to

8867.16 --> 8874.24
like older guys it's basically my target

8870.56 --> 8876.319
audience is from 12 to to 60 or

8874.24 --> 8877.88
something and might even be older but

8876.319 --> 8880.399
mostly

8877.88 --> 8882.319
that that's just what it is that's what

8880.399 --> 8886.72
I got in mind when I do the show because

8882.319 --> 8891.359
I deem those people to have developed

8886.72 --> 8893.319
faculties enough to be capable of

8891.359 --> 8895.279
understanding what I'm talking about if

8893.319 --> 8897.399
you're too young you're not going to

8895.279 --> 8900.640000000001
understand what I'm talking

8897.399 --> 8903.24
about you might have some hints but

8900.64 --> 8905.199999999999
you're not going to understand but you

8903.24 --> 8906.72
could still get hurt with your feelings

8905.2 --> 8909.880000000001
so don't do

8906.72 --> 8912.24
[Music]

8909.88 --> 8915.96
that I wouldn't have a problem with my

8912.24 --> 8918.479
teenage son watching this show in ATT in

8915.96 --> 8922.56
fact you wouldn't okay well teenage

8918.479 --> 8926.119999999999
means 12 plus right so

8922.56 --> 8928.68
yeah and if you deem him fit to do that

8926.12 --> 8928.68
then

8929.04 --> 8932.04
yeah

8933.279 --> 8938.08
that's why it's 12 plus I chose that

8935.84 --> 8940.24
very specifically like I was even

8938.08 --> 8941.439
recommended against that by like Nathan

8940.24 --> 8945.039999999999
and all

8941.439 --> 8946.479000000001
that way back years back so like why you

8945.04 --> 8948.04
need to stop swearing you need to stop

8946.479 --> 8949.72
doing this and like oh your target

8948.04 --> 8952.68
audience will become smaller I'm like

8949.72 --> 8957.24
dude I don't want little this is not a

8952.68 --> 8957.24
show for little children it

8957.319 --> 8962.039999999999
isn't it's just not it never will

8964.2 --> 8971.359
be like even when I'm around little

8967.96 --> 8974.399
children and I am sometimes when with

8971.359 --> 8978.880000000001
other people and all that like I just

8974.399 --> 8981.08
shut up mostly I get more physical like

8978.88 --> 8983.8
physically entertaining like I play

8981.08 --> 8987.24
around or I mimic things or make funny

8983.8 --> 8990.278999999999
sounds what but I don't like talk then

8987.24 --> 8993.84
as much because when I start talking I I

8990.279 --> 8995.960000000001
just it's very hard to like lower down

8993.84 --> 8997.84
the communication level to like little

8995.96 --> 9000.8
CH that's tough for

8997.84 --> 9004.359
me dude that was tough for me when I was

9000.8 --> 9007.399
a little kid that's why when I was six I

9004.359 --> 9012.84
would just like I want an adult to have

9007.399 --> 9016.439
an adult conversation with about

9012.84 --> 9018.8
philosophy like Mr Bean what a little

9016.439 --> 9018.800000000001
bit

9018.96 --> 9023.96
yeah

9020.76 --> 9026.279
look at the mustache just silly things

9023.96 --> 9029.039999999999
like little kid entertainment right I I

9026.279 --> 9032.84
can be entertaining but I'll be more

9029.04 --> 9037.68
physical at it not like oh let me tell

9032.84 --> 9037.68
you a story like it's tough for

9043.88 --> 9049.599999999999
me I find that

9046.88 --> 9052.92
difficult because when I start thinking

9049.6 --> 9055.319
I just start thinking at this level and

9052.92 --> 9057.399
it's very hard to reduce that down to

9055.319 --> 9060.519999999999
like children level thinking it's very

9057.399 --> 9063.08
hard for me I'm not good at

9060.52 --> 9065.319000000001
that so I then just stick to More

9063.08 --> 9068.319
Physical oriented entertainment and all

9065.319 --> 9068.319
that

9077.88 --> 9084.519999999999
right d very quiet for a while right

9081.84 --> 9087.359
well maybe the Earth stopped moving

9084.52 --> 9089.12
upward or maybe he actually found the

9087.359 --> 9091.279
edge and tried to prove that it was

9089.12 --> 9095.439
accelerating up so he jumped off it and

9091.279 --> 9095.439
now he can't get back Shadow

9108.84 --> 9114.960000000001
purple is gas

9112.84 --> 9118.16
what

9114.96 --> 9120.199999999999
okay yeah I'm not literally Mr Bean and

9118.16 --> 9121.92
I'm not going to do that to entertain

9120.2 --> 9124.68
you you

9121.92 --> 9126.2
understand I know you [ __ ] trolls out

9124.68 --> 9128.0

9143.56 --> 9149.479
grow up yes I don't care yeah you're not

9147.12 --> 9152.160000000002
my little children yeah you don't

9149.479 --> 9152.16
deserve

9158.72 --> 9161.91
[Music]

9168.84 --> 9171.84
that

9184.72 --> 9190.319
by the way the way that Mr Bean does his

9187.04 --> 9192.399000000001
silly things is very close it's actually

9190.319 --> 9195.08
very close to how Yoda talks have you

9192.399 --> 9195.08
ever noticed

9198.76 --> 9205.359
that you probably never saw that

9201.96 --> 9208.039999999999
correlation it's very

9205.359 --> 9212.08
similar like Yoda gets silly in Star

9208.04 --> 9215.720000000001
Wars 2 and all that or Star Wars uh

9212.08 --> 9218.2
5 that's just like how Mr Bean kind of

9215.72 --> 9219.479
talks it's really funny when you start

9218.2 --> 9223.399000000001
to notice

9219.479 --> 9225.319
that hey here we go again see you Johnny

9223.399 --> 9228.72
Eng yeah Johnny English is interesting

9225.319 --> 9231.72
set of movies they're very

9228.72 --> 9231.72
interesting

9232.52 --> 9237.960000000001
Johnny English is basically

9235.08 --> 9242.359
like an older Mr

9237.96 --> 9242.358999999999
Bean cross over with James

9246.82 --> 9252.16
[Music]

9249.479 --> 9254.679999999998
Bond I was Charmed by those movies I

9252.16 --> 9254.68
thought they were

9257.64 --> 9263.399
good maybe even better than Mr Bean

9260.24 --> 9265.359
because Mr Bean like it was sometimes

9263.399 --> 9266.519999999999
really funny but it was also like a

9265.359 --> 9269.640000000001
little

9266.52 --> 9273.640000000001
annoying but I mean it's because Mr Bean

9269.64 --> 9278.199999999999
is really for children it's really for

9273.64 --> 9278.199999999999
children it's very suitable for little

9278.84 --> 9285.16
children Johnny English is a little bit

9281.56 --> 9285.16
more adult like

9288.64 --> 9291.64
that

9318.64 --> 9321.64
for

9335.6 --> 9339.359
what somebody going

9348.64 --> 9351.64
away

9378.56 --> 9381.56
right

9387.359 --> 9392.640000000001
right debatable D I mean yeah I don't

9389.88 --> 9396.08
even remember that that was some really

9392.64 --> 9398.68
silly stuff there with Mr

9396.08 --> 9400.479
Bean what I mostly remember is the time

9398.68 --> 9404.0
when he tried to paint his house and

9400.479 --> 9406.56
then he just got bored with it and then

9404.0 --> 9408.52
put a stick of dynamite in the paint can

9406.56 --> 9411.519999999999
that's the thing that I really

9408.52 --> 9411.52
remember
