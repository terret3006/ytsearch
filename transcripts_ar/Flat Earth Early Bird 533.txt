93.6 --> 98.44
this is like the best summer day ever

96.46 --> 102.19
for the before the Netherlands oh what a

98.44 --> 104.92
day like this so warm and it's a little

102.19 --> 109.03
bit of wind but even the wind is it's

104.92 --> 112.799
not cold it's not hot it's like a little

109.03 --> 117.33
bit in between it it's it's delightful

112.799 --> 119.67
and yeah the Sun is just blasting off

117.33 --> 122.2
look at the bird

119.67 --> 128.159
there's constantly birds just flying

122.2 --> 128.159
here little ones

128.3 --> 134.42000000000002
yeah I think actually the type that

131.51 --> 138.62
shows up on the intro one of those it

134.42 --> 140.89999999999998
are very close to it one a very tiny

138.62 --> 142.37
bird very quick and has a nest right

140.9 --> 146.42000000000002
under the roof there and constantly

142.37 --> 148.52
flies back and forth right in between

146.42 --> 151.22
here and the little chimney over there

148.52 --> 152.93
that you're looking at because it's

151.22 --> 155.6
going off to the Waterside to collect

152.93 --> 161.54000000000002
bucks very blatantly so it's not

155.6 --> 164.2
interested in bread or anything and yeah

161.54 --> 164.2
beautiful

165.19 --> 169.42
I'm almost surprised that I managed it

167.17 --> 175.86999999999998
start the show on time with this type of

169.42 --> 179.29
weather as usually I just doze off like

175.87 --> 185.23000000000002
this so put on a white shirt definitely

179.29 --> 188.26
a white shirt day if it got even hotter

185.23 --> 189.76
I it would be a no shirt day but yeah

188.26 --> 192.94
it's not that bad especially now that

189.76 --> 202.35999999999999
the Sun doesn't hit then we know

192.94 --> 204.49
directly anymore so let's see who is in

202.36 --> 209.59

afternoon

233.46 --> 236.64000000000001
Amanda young

238.58 --> 241.33
all right

245.39 --> 250.01
10:00 p.m. okay so you're on the east

248.39 --> 251.92999999999998
coast of the United States I take it

250.01 --> 257.2
Flat Earth oh no wait

251.93 --> 262.25
I'll see Roscoe tip 10 p.m. wait right

257.2 --> 280.15
then you're probably on the west coast

262.25 --> 280.15
of Australia right hey Adam ikan woke

300.26 --> 309.27
[Music]

301.55 --> 312.32
right sleeping warrior I get the feeling

309.27 --> 314.66999999999996
that yeah I know you've been very

312.32 --> 315.23
tenacious and yeah you should be proud

314.67 --> 317.52000000000004
of that

315.23 --> 320.66
concerning this situation here with

317.52 --> 322.44
Randy you know and he's been just oh

320.66 --> 326.37
it's pretty

322.44 --> 329.1
yeah repulsive as expected personally

326.37 --> 329.79
but I think that everybody's gotten kind

329.1 --> 332.13
of sick of it

329.79 --> 336.42
and they and they just want the damaged

332.13 --> 338.58
party Roxanne to be reimbursed and they

336.42 --> 341.7
just don't care about Randy don't want

338.58 --> 344.03999999999996
it from him necessarily anymore they

341.7 --> 347.47999999999996
just want it out of the way I think and

344.04 --> 347.48
maybe that's why Amanda did it

356.61 --> 361.25
am i anywhere close there Amanda

367.84 --> 371.02
[Music]

374.94 --> 383.44
great great subject to start out with we

379.05 --> 385.27000000000004
it's not much of subject really but yes

383.44 --> 389.83
Lee Poirier is technically correct you

385.27 --> 393.76
know and that's why I do support him in

389.83 --> 394.41999999999996
what he does because it is it's just not

393.76 --> 396.49
right

394.42 --> 399.7
nothing about what's going on is right

396.49 --> 402.84000000000003
and I don't know like yeah what Sam

399.7 --> 406.12
Hayden's influence in this really is I

402.84 --> 410.77
kind of lost track at it I hope it'll

406.12 --> 414.16
come float eventually but I personally

410.77 --> 416.28999999999996
don't want to just be fixated on like

414.16 --> 424.15000000000003
it's only giving Randy more attention

416.29 --> 426.49
really like he's even glad to to talk

424.15 --> 430.21
about it and just gosh all over the

426.49 --> 433.78000000000003
place on his show so yeah that's a sign

430.21 --> 438.60999999999996
that he's okay with the attention you

433.78 --> 442.0
know kind of Thank You Amanda young I

438.61 --> 444.19
really appreciate that yeah you you've

442.0 --> 447.7
donated a lot through PayPal it's helped

444.19 --> 455.32
me so much thank you so much and I know

447.7 --> 457.3
the other sponsors here now I think it's

455.32 --> 459.87
just probably ranty trolls than just

457.3 --> 459.87
trying to poke around

472.48 --> 478.84900000000005
[Music]

474.969 --> 480.71
right so sleeping warrior yeah look I

478.849 --> 482.659
think the best you can do is just point

480.71 --> 488.31899999999996
out the truth and what you've

482.659 --> 491.719
investigated and just let it be you know

488.319 --> 495.379
maybe if Randy is doing something like

491.719 --> 497.33
that again yeah you could be warning

495.379 --> 501.8
people and pointing back at like yeah

497.33 --> 508.00899999999996
he's done something like that before was

501.8 --> 509.539
very unapologetic so yeah I think that's

508.009 --> 512.11
the best you can hope to get out of this

509.539 --> 512.11
Tony

512.52 --> 515.61
[Music]

518.19 --> 520.94
yo

533.76 --> 536.48
yeah

546.38 --> 552.61
yes av Kim white shirt that's right I

549.8 --> 560.9689999999999
have a white shirt

552.61 --> 560.969
[Music]

595.42 --> 604.9499999999999
aurÃ©lia man to you well I don't know I

601.95 --> 609.4000000000001
think Randy could do that

604.95 --> 611.5200000000001
although did it's he's always about just

609.4 --> 616.24
were to agree with that you know

611.52 --> 620.29
so maybe technically you are correct but

616.24 --> 634.8100000000001
he's always fooling around you know with

620.29 --> 639.16
their rules Voynich which Jason Jason of

634.81 --> 642.9399999999999
the disparate family yeah I think yeah I

639.16 --> 644.86
did see that I also visited Roxanne's

642.94 --> 647.34
channel yesterday was pretty it was

644.86 --> 647.34
pretty good

661.42 --> 672.15
yeah so yeah you know check out Roxanne

664.33 --> 672.1500000000001
the globalist denier was it let me

677.23 --> 685.0600000000001
I wish YouTube still showed a list where

681.61 --> 690.34
I can keep track of my activities then

685.06 --> 692.3699999999999
it would be much easier to find such

690.34 --> 692.37
things

702.369 --> 714.86
come on oh wait it's just rocks and

710.449 --> 716.809
globe lie right no it is rocks and the

714.86 --> 724.22
globe is a few rocks and globalized

716.809 --> 728.0889999999999
search it also shows it right so yeah

724.22 --> 732.1700000000001
she she has a show it's it's a different

728.089 --> 734.149
type of feel to it you know she's she's

732.17 --> 738.7299999999999
playing well she is of course British

734.149 --> 741.529
and she is I guess trying to attune

738.73 --> 743.929
everything a little bit more to well

741.529 --> 747.86
yeah the British walk scene it's kind of

743.929 --> 750.649
difficult for me it's like oh dear in a

747.86 --> 755.509
way yeah that means you can be

750.649 --> 759.11
surrounded by leftists but yeah she's

755.509 --> 761.72
really trying to like secure that

759.11 --> 763.759
frequency and kind of yeah make it real

761.72 --> 765.889
and I do respect that even though it's

763.759 --> 768.589
kind of like out of my personal tastes

765.889 --> 771.499
reach a little but I do respect it I try

768.589 --> 775.6890000000001
to respect it like I get how that works

771.499 --> 780.9200000000001
and yeah it's always an amusing show

775.689 --> 786.4699999999999
like to her and her co-host what's his

780.92 --> 788.42
name again the other guy he also plays

786.47 --> 791.649
guitar he said had some pretty good

788.42 --> 791.649
performances recorded

801.96 --> 808.74
I mean he's a great guy I just seem to

805.07 --> 810.24
not remember his name now I'm never

808.74 --> 813.36
really a champion at names

810.24 --> 817.49
it's just bite by lucky chance that I

813.36 --> 817.49
can remember people's name easily

825.27 --> 828.14
anybody

832.81 --> 838.3599999999999
Yeah right Guns of Navarone well yeah

836.68 --> 841.42
you're being a little bit forward about

838.36 --> 845.0500000000001
it but technically yeah I've had my own

841.42 --> 848.89
experiences and I've yeah I'm being a

845.05 --> 851.8299999999999
little bit more forgiving or while we

848.89 --> 856.66
have forgiving not really it's just I'm

851.83 --> 859.48
just letting him figure it out on his

856.66 --> 862.48
own and I try not to get it involved as

859.48 --> 864.34
much as I can when something happens I

862.48 --> 879.5500000000001
will speak the truth about it as how as

864.34 --> 882.52
I see it right Amanda young

879.55 --> 885.8499999999999
well the trolls have caught up on that

882.52 --> 888.49
time where I got the 250 PayPal

885.85 --> 890.1700000000001
donations from Samhain and then

888.49 --> 891.88
basically didn't get the air filter

890.17 --> 895.9599999999999
because I didn't have the price together

891.88 --> 899.74
and now yeah with how things change that

895.96 --> 901.45
makes me look a little silly and to be

899.74 --> 903.07
fair I'm not happy that I don't have it

901.45 --> 906.61
because I really do want I'm still on

903.07 --> 910.87
the on the agenda it's just there's like

906.61 --> 918.72
a vacation payout moment in the year and

910.87 --> 921.97
it should happen early June I hope and

918.72 --> 924.69
that's what I can then buy it with so I

921.97 --> 924.69
will get it

932.14 --> 937.87
okay well the sorry to see I I don't

936.31 --> 940.27
even know who you are really I don't

937.87 --> 943.15
think that Sam really cares too much I

940.27 --> 946.05
was very open and honest about it to him

943.15 --> 950.59
directly and in his is in the chat I

946.05 --> 955.5699999999999
have basically apologized for it but

950.59 --> 959.89
yeah I will get I will get it it just

955.57 --> 962.8900000000001
didn't work out at that moment because I

959.89 --> 964.99
don't basically say yeah yeah I want

962.89 --> 967.63
this and then get a lot of money for it

964.99 --> 971.02
and then don't get it eventually

967.63 --> 972.76
but I don't do that unless there's like

971.02 --> 975.5799999999999
a thing that just doesn't get any

972.76 --> 977.53
donations like the microphone standard

975.58 --> 982.8100000000001
that I kind of tried out earlier and

977.53 --> 985.42
then yeah all that kind of still do want

982.81 --> 989.5899999999999
that but it's like on the far end of

985.42 --> 997.63
priorities right now so not gonna get

989.59 --> 1000.5
that to that for a while mmm a Sarita

997.63 --> 1000.5
Cosentino

1005.99 --> 1011.0600000000001
yeah it's it's funny that that you're

1009.02 --> 1012.4399999999999
hanging around a lot now in the discord

1011.06 --> 1017.4799999999999
server over over at the Flat Earth

1012.44 --> 1021.9200000000001
debates it's kind of funny to also hear

1017.48 --> 1024.28
more of your voice you're a fun guy to

1021.92 --> 1024.28
have around

1028.9 --> 1031.949
[Music]

1036.53 --> 1039.69
[Music]

1041.56 --> 1049.49
look sleeping warrior Tony you gotta

1044.99 --> 1051.98
recognize that after a certain well it

1049.49 --> 1055.76
does kind of feel like Randy is just

1051.98 --> 1061.22
trolling you is East basically trying to

1055.76 --> 1064.09
make you obsessed with him okay you got

1061.22 --> 1064.09
to be careful with that [Â __Â ]

1069.49 --> 1079.28
just record the misdeeds follow up on

1073.91 --> 1082.66
your plan and yeah let let the cards

1079.28 --> 1082.66
fall in place as well

1088.16 --> 1091.309
[Music]

1099.91 --> 1102.999
[Music]

1123.299 --> 1129.44
you think so said it at cousin Tina rent

1126.57 --> 1138.539
as Randy changed lot I don't think so

1129.44 --> 1146.6390000000001
he's just become more shameless more

1138.539 --> 1151.279
forward about his yeah is yeah his

1146.639 --> 1151.279
choices the way he likes to do things

1159.5 --> 1164.9
well yeah he has always been like that

1161.69 --> 1167.48
but there was like the first time that

1164.9 --> 1170.8700000000001
for me it really became apparent that

1167.48 --> 1173.48
Randy was kind of just there was

1170.87 --> 1176.33
something wrong with him was in the

1173.48 --> 1178.58
early days when yeah there was goofing

1176.33 --> 1182.8899999999999
around and a little bit of bullying and

1178.58 --> 1185.9289999999999
he would just not apologize for blatant

1182.89 --> 1189.0490000000002
violate a violating type of action in

1185.929 --> 1191.9
this case sniping when that was still

1189.049 --> 1194.03
possible in the panel and he never

1191.9 --> 1197.0590000000002
apologized for it and like he would

1194.03 --> 1201.1399999999999
laugh at you for even suggesting such

1197.059 --> 1204.61
things and that is a clear sign when

1201.14 --> 1209.7800000000002
they get maniacal when they should just

1204.61 --> 1211.1589999999999
fall back apologize and then rebuild you

1209.78 --> 1214.309
know that's what everyone should do

1211.159 --> 1218.0590000000002
that's that's how you learn and he's

1214.309 --> 1221.98
just like no I don't care that that was

1218.059 --> 1221.98
the first sign for me that's years ago

1223.72 --> 1231.049
and it's kind of weird and don't take it

1227.78 --> 1233.57
the wrong way but in his own way Nathan

1231.049 --> 1240.07
had a little bit of that too but with

1233.57 --> 1246.98
him I think it's more that he just I

1240.07 --> 1249.71
don't know it likes to be a bad boy so

1246.98 --> 1251.96
like when he's being tested he will

1249.71 --> 1253.49
violate the test on purpose just to

1251.96 --> 1255.799
prove that he doesn't give a [Â __Â ] about

1253.49 --> 1257.98
your test basically even if it is a

1255.799 --> 1262.12
spiritual test that kind of thing

1257.98 --> 1266.289
although in general he's not like super

1262.12 --> 1271.85
anti you know he's just kind of a common

1266.289 --> 1276.83
approach guy not too focused on on the

1271.85 --> 1279.1399999999999
spiritual side so it's not the same it's

1276.83 --> 1282.4089999999999
it's like the motivation behind his

1279.14 --> 1285.0200000000002
actions are very clear to me with Randy

1282.409 --> 1287.71
his unapologetic nature is just it's

1285.02 --> 1291.1299999999999
just no good it's his personal

1287.71 --> 1291.13
unwillingness and

1291.86 --> 1297.35
and that unwillingness is not like just

1294.86 --> 1300.4399999999998
to admit a mistake in the moment but to

1297.35 --> 1304.85
like hang on to that psychologically

1300.44 --> 1313.8500000000001
that it isn't a mistake like for real

1304.85 --> 1328.6689999999999
that's the problem with Randi anyway so

1313.85 --> 1330.8799999999999
said enough about all this fake PayPal

1328.669 --> 1330.88
donation

1341.0 --> 1346.65
that's bizarre work look I know you're

1344.82 --> 1349.32
just trying to troll me and basically

1346.65 --> 1352.71
try to ensue that I'm involved in the

1349.32 --> 1355.74
lies because I gave the email of Samhain

1352.71 --> 1359.46
to Adam II can write but yeah

1355.74 --> 1364.11
theoretically it's possible that it

1359.46 --> 1367.02
wasn't the real Samhain somehow in some

1364.11 --> 1369.27
way okay that it may be an alternative

1367.02 --> 1372.15
Samhain that's been kind of riding in

1369.27 --> 1374.31
between nobody took notice but I still

1372.15 --> 1377.16
did get that money it's like on my bank

1374.31 --> 1380.22
account so that donation was literally

1377.16 --> 1383.3400000000001
real but technically it might have been

1380.22 --> 1385.59
a weird covert Samhain or something

1383.34 --> 1386.99
although the chance is really remote

1385.59 --> 1389.1599999999999
because the email has been

1386.99 --> 1393.27
cross-reference but again again as I

1389.16 --> 1397.6100000000001
said there might be some weird fake

1393.27 --> 1399.87
Samhain really closely looking like it

1397.61 --> 1402.3
borrowing is way through but that's like

1399.87 --> 1406.7399999999998
that's extremely paranoid and really to

1402.3 --> 1414.57
assume that all right talking purely

1406.74 --> 1420.96
about theoretics so yeah you know I just

1414.57 --> 1423.21
I there's no trickery on my part and as

1420.96 --> 1424.64
I said before the situation with Simon

1423.21 --> 1428.63
is kind of weird

1424.64 --> 1434.18
different type of things heard I said

1428.63 --> 1439.47
but I just I can't really judge about it

1434.18 --> 1441.3
because yeah I it's not like everybody

1439.47 --> 1443.6100000000001
sitting around the table physically

1441.3 --> 1445.62
print having printed out all their

1443.61 --> 1448.6799999999998
things or showing it live on their

1445.62 --> 1451.6799999999998
computers really honestly to figure out

1448.68 --> 1455.16
what's real no people are politicized

1451.68 --> 1460.79
and they're obsessed with the other one

1455.16 --> 1460.7900000000002
being a guilty party so it's you know

1461.23 --> 1471.3890000000001
it probably hallenby I don't know flat

1465.639 --> 1471.389
ball that's that's hilarious

1485.74 --> 1494.2
this begins to sound like an Agati

1488.909 --> 1496.929
Agatha Christie Christie novel no idea

1494.2 --> 1502.14
what that is but okay

1496.929 --> 1505.99
where is her killer hair cue for Warhol

1502.14 --> 1508.8700000000001
Thank You laughs oh is that how you

they've got it's like the feel of debt

1557.24 --> 1567.419
melting away thank you so much for the

1565.86 --> 1570.6299999999999
PayPal donation and the superjet

1567.419 --> 1578.8500000000001
donation Amanda you you're my number one

1570.63 --> 1581.48
fan it seems thank you so much and an

1578.85 --> 1581.48
early member

1599.11 --> 1603.519
right oh yeah and the special sighting

1601.929 --> 1610.0590000000002
little tight details

1603.519 --> 1612.22
I saw swallows right it was in the

1610.059 --> 1616.029
morning yesterday I didn't talk about

1612.22 --> 1620.23
yesterday but that's like I haven't seen

1616.029 --> 1623.169
swallows in a long long time and they

1620.23 --> 1628.559
were not African swallows carrying a

1623.169 --> 1632.71
coconut just regular small type swallows

1628.559 --> 1634.84
that kind of and yeah they are

1632.71 --> 1636.19
apparently morning creatures I kind of

1634.84 --> 1638.3799999999999
forgot about it because I gotta get it

1636.19 --> 1641.1390000000001
up in the morning a lot but they were

1638.38 --> 1644.5
going around I guess catching the

1641.139 --> 1647.529
morning mosquitos it's good to see

1644.5 --> 1649.0
they're still around because they as far

1647.529 --> 1653.94
as I've learned there they've become

1649.0 --> 1653.94
really rare compared to 100 years ago

1654.36 --> 1661.24
and they were originally the natural

1658.179 --> 1664.8700000000001
mosquito catchers in the Netherlands at

1661.24 --> 1668.5
least but yeah I guess that they've kind

1664.87 --> 1671.559
of put out some bats and their evening

1668.5 --> 1676.26
mosquito hunters to kind of offset it a

1671.559 --> 1676.26
little and I think that's great anyway

1686.95 --> 1698.169
I'm sorry to Cosentino you didn't know

1689.07 --> 1700.45
ah well look if you want to keep track

1698.169 --> 1702.73
about that sort of thing you need to

1700.45 --> 1705.519
subscribe to sleeping warrior because

1702.73 --> 1707.98
he's totally onto that he makes almost

1705.519 --> 1709.8990000000001
daily videos about it now but the

1707.98 --> 1721.659
progress and the interaction and all

1709.899 --> 1731.379
that all the details all right said he's

1721.659 --> 1733.5390000000002
a concertina and she probably does also

1731.379 --> 1737.789
although to be fair I think that Roxanne

1733.539 --> 1741.489
is doing okay like she seems very mellow

1737.789 --> 1744.58
and so I think that she's probably like

1741.489 --> 1746.739
doing okay and her show is like really

1744.58 --> 1750.029
getting out of just more energy it's

1746.739 --> 1750.029
just yeah

1753.61 --> 1759.82
okay that's just ridiculous work if you

1757.63 --> 1763.8100000000002
keep that up here you're gonna solicit

1759.82 --> 1788.01
it a time out it's getting kind of silly

1763.81 --> 1788.01
now get out that's just pathetic man

1788.67 --> 1799.74
they don't try to play us off against

1795.7 --> 1799.74
one and I like that it's really pathetic

1817.5 --> 1820.86
right uh-huh

1824.9 --> 1829.4
don't necessarily like like to keep

1827.75 --> 1832.12
saying that guns I've never owned but

1829.4 --> 1832.1200000000001

crazy names

1863.77 --> 1868.7
disgusting names then you can banned

1866.72 --> 1872.29
them quickly to prevent the chat from

1868.7 --> 1878.26
being cluttered up but it's voluntary

1872.29 --> 1878.26
but okay

1884.73 --> 1895.56
don't need to ban him for that it's a

1891.52 --> 1895.56
little of an overreaction there Cleary

1900.72 --> 1905.59
okay yeah I remember you saying earlier

1903.55 --> 1908.02
that you wanted me to take your wrench

1905.59 --> 1910.77
away well if you're gonna be like that

1908.02 --> 1910.77
then I will

1917.92 --> 1924.0700000000002

1939.36 --> 1945.49
you know and look I don't know exactly

1942.76 --> 1948.24
what Cleary's deal in all of this is but

1945.49 --> 1953.3700000000001
he's given made it plain and clear

1948.24 --> 1956.5
clearly that he likes ranty and he's I

1953.37 --> 1958.4189999999999
guess he trusts him or something I don't

1956.5 --> 1962.919
know what his deal is exactly but he

1958.419 --> 1965.2
doesn't like us like making yeah saying

1962.919 --> 1967.6000000000001
stupid [Â __Â ] or disgusting [Â __Â ] about

1965.2 --> 1973.99
Randy so that's why I try not to do that

1967.6 --> 1976.6

2069.54 --> 2074.97
very nice he did though right after

2072.179 --> 2077.159
thought he was a great idea to

2074.97 --> 2080.1589999999997
continually over this time span of like

2077.159 --> 2082.4700000000003
two weeks make fun of me about how I

2080.159 --> 2088.679
didn't thank him for it and literally

2082.47 --> 2092.5499999999997
rant about that this was very unpleasant

2088.679 --> 2094.53
and make me literally regret having the

2092.55 --> 2100.11
damn thing and that kind of still

2094.53 --> 2102.71
lingers on you know because that's how

2100.11 --> 2106.05

non pleasurable Association I have with

2141.33 --> 2144.5299999999997
[Music]

2148.789 --> 2157.259
you wanted to use it as a political tool

2153.95 --> 2159.5389999999998
obviously to make yourself look good and

2157.259 --> 2162.9
to make me look bad and you you abused

2159.539 --> 2169.6800000000003
it to the full extent of your ability

2162.9 --> 2173.039
was blatantly obvious and yeah it's any

2169.68 --> 2175.47
kind of demand from your side now to to

2173.039 --> 2180.779
do anything about it is just completely

2175.47 --> 2182.3999999999996
ridiculous yeah sorry that Casa de rent

basically nothing out of the ordinary I

2216.72 --> 2220.589
just want Randy to continue what he's

2218.73 --> 2222.809
doing whatever he wants to be doing

2220.589 --> 2227.0099999999998
because there's only one direction

2222.809 --> 2229.5890000000004
that's going at and eventually he'll

2227.01 --> 2232.7990000000004
practically be out of my hair so I can

2229.589 --> 2235.41
just enjoy the device for the device

2232.799 --> 2241.079

[Music]

this is just garbage in chat people

2367.09 --> 2374.8
getting all nonsensically distracted by

2369.64 --> 2377.35
this complete ass of a guy instead of oh

2374.8 --> 2380.4700000000003
I don't know continuing the Flat Earth

2377.35 --> 2385.12
debate or just some things that have

2380.47 --> 2388.6299999999997
been popping up in the feeds like the

2385.12 --> 2392.02
link that York Sanford posted like the

2388.63 --> 2396.58
first thing in the Today Show you know

2392.02 --> 2402.25

2396.58 --> 2407.25
I'm just gonna show you this now I don't

2402.25 --> 2415.5
know how valuable it could be considered

2407.25 --> 2415.5
but it is still interesting thought

2417.04 --> 2420.95
it's just the weird thing about it yeah

2419.81 --> 2423.47
there's some weird elements to it

2420.95 --> 2430.58
anyways supposedly this progress in

2423.47 --> 2433.8199999999997
electrical plasma technology has yeah in

2430.58 --> 2436.43
in freakin Wuhan like really scientists

2433.82 --> 2444.04
in Wuhan eff apparently now figured this

2436.43 --> 2448.19
out so just wondering like what really

2444.04 --> 2450.77
the woman is a giant giant city of

2448.19 --> 2454.48
course a big bear on Benjamin has shared

2450.77 --> 2457.4
that shared some pretty astonishing

2454.48 --> 2459.62
architecture footage and all that and

2457.4 --> 2461.9500000000003
all the lighting in so yeah it is a

2459.62 --> 2466.0099999999998
pretty astonishing city and it's huge

2461.95 --> 2467.72
but just meanwhile the world is going

2466.01 --> 2471.3500000000004
around like wooo on whoo and all of the

2467.72 --> 2475.7
coronavirus and now this kind of stuff

2471.35 --> 2481.96
technology up updates progress stuff

2475.7 --> 2481.96
going on so they now have a new type of

2482.02 --> 2492.71
jet engine based on microwave air plasma

2487.93 --> 2494.6299999999997
and the weird thing is is that it's just

2492.71 --> 2497.06
roughly described here it's not very

2494.63 --> 2502.46
elaborate article but it reminds me

2497.06 --> 2504.74
immediately immediately of the whole

2502.46 --> 2507.41
issue that the conspiracy that came up

2504.74 --> 2513.9799999999996
earlier for me it was through glow

2507.41 --> 2516.62
Buster's about the jet engines that are

2513.98 --> 2520.48
have been used for like decades that

2516.62 --> 2523.49
used like a vacuum type

2520.48 --> 2526.69
yeah they create a vacuum that is then

2523.49 --> 2527.9799999999996
somehow utilized to create a perpetual

2526.69 --> 2530.15
propulse

2527.98 --> 2532.88
propulsion it's pretty incredible and

2530.15 --> 2535.1
that's why the the Jets barely cost any

2532.88 --> 2538.25
fuel only is a fuel for the startup of

2535.1 --> 2540.89
it so I'm wondering like is this the

2538.25 --> 2543.8
coming out of that is that is there is

2540.89 --> 2545.6
this that is this the coming out of the

2543.8 --> 2549.6400000000003
technology and then oh it's all going to

2545.6 --> 2549.64
be very cheaply integrated yeah

2549.82 --> 2559.13
like that so it's not like I didn't know

2552.71 --> 2565.82
interesting so thanks for bringing that

2559.13 --> 2571.37
up - George Sanford yeah did you think

2565.82 --> 2572.96
the same thing because that's just the

2571.37 --> 2579.3199999999997
first thing that popped into my mind

2572.96 --> 2582.38
when I read that and oh yeah to get back

2579.32 --> 2584.78
to the whole the weirdness tying into it

2582.38 --> 2590.06
being one and like everybody knows about

2584.78 --> 2593.84
war now I'm just wondering is this fake

2590.06 --> 2598.5499999999997
virus stuff this fake panic that's so

2593.84 --> 2601.13
massive and our media reinforced and

2598.55 --> 2607.4300000000003
utilized a corporate system and getting

2601.13 --> 2611.1800000000003
into government is that really like a

2607.43 --> 2614.87
program where it's basically just really

2611.18 --> 2616.93
there to put Wuhan on the map in the

2614.87 --> 2619.7
consciousness of people and now they're

2616.93 --> 2622.2799999999997
coming out with these technologies while

2619.7 --> 2625.04
everybody knows and it's looking and

2622.28 --> 2627.32
just looking like what kind of like I am

2625.04 --> 2629.12
like what but we don't want a virus but

2627.32 --> 2630.79
yeah at the same time there's this

2629.12 --> 2634.64
amazing stuff happening there and

2630.79 --> 2637.12
buildings are awesome when you see it so

2634.64 --> 2641.24
it's almost like is this an

2637.12 --> 2644.42
advertisement project almost from their

2641.24 --> 2650.5899999999997
perspective have they designed it to

2644.42 --> 2653.27
have that as a side effect because yeah

2650.59 --> 2656.1200000000003
everybody knows about Wuhan China now

2653.27 --> 2659.93
through the media everyone now they know

2656.12 --> 2662.18
it for the virus stuff but it's just a

2659.93 --> 2665.56
location that's arrived in the

2662.18 --> 2665.56
consciousness of people now

2670.55 --> 2677.6400000000003
yeah [Â __Â ] off rentee go scored on your

the other donation the other day too

2943.16 --> 2950.41
you're really helping me out a lot hmm

2947.41 --> 2953.839
you guys are really generous like I

2950.41 --> 2957.049
don't know technically like in what in

2953.839 --> 2959.089
your financial scope like how much is to

2957.049 --> 2966.349
me that's like huge amounts it's like

2959.089 --> 2969.499
entire okay take it easy guys but to me

2966.349 --> 2971.9
that's like it I don't know what I

2969.499 --> 2974.509
remember to be like they incomes and

2971.9 --> 2980.1800000000003
[Â __Â ] you know that was a workdays of

2974.509 --> 2981.859
income 60 euros so it's to me it's just

2980.18 --> 2986.69
seeing that happiness just like whoa

2981.859 --> 2988.819
dude but I gotta also keep in mind that

2986.69 --> 2994.19
I shouldn't be afraid of it because I do

2988.819 --> 2997.91
need a lot you know and this [Â __Â ] is

2994.19 --> 3001.2690000000002
helping me yeah prevent slipping into

2997.91 --> 3003.0989999999997
stupid mental places again and yeah how

3001.269 --> 3007.7189999999996
long has it been since I've gone Rach

3003.099 --> 3011.7690000000002
win right it's been quite a while well I

3007.719 --> 3014.4990000000003
can safely say it is because I've just

3011.769 --> 3016.8689999999997
been able to handle everything now like

3014.499 --> 3020.6499999999996
and whenever something annoying or bad

3016.869 --> 3023.7690000000002
in my own personal life comes up it's

3020.65 --> 3025.869
like it's like oh yeah I don't like it

3023.769 --> 3028.359
like sometimes I really don't like it

3025.869 --> 3030.489
but I can handle it no it's like it I

3028.359 --> 3033.0989999999997
can manage it at least it's not like oh

3030.489 --> 3036.9990000000003
my god I have to freaking sacrifice

3033.099 --> 3040.2090000000003
something not something living but just

3036.999 --> 3042.91
like don't even want to get into it's

3040.209 --> 3045.219
like the throwaway [Â __Â ] because I don't

3042.91 --> 3047.499
have any room for it that like stuff

3045.219 --> 3051.059
from my past that I have been trying to

3047.499 --> 3053.45
hold on to for long and that kind of

3051.059 --> 3056.0
anyway

3053.45 --> 3058.8999999999996
all the finances of the financial

3056.0 --> 3061.19
support is helping me a lot it's really

3058.9 --> 3063.02
giving me also more confidence

3061.19 --> 3067.21
concerning the show what I'm doing and

3063.02 --> 3071.3
my other activities and other platforms

3067.21 --> 3075.859
and I have been quite active right doing

3071.3 --> 3080.27
right yeah I do still get maybe a little

3075.859 --> 3082.79
energetic towards other people on other

3080.27 --> 3084.079
channels like last time I guess you

3082.79 --> 3085.88
could save right yeah that's not really

3084.079 --> 3088.099
rage win you know rage win is something

3085.88 --> 3095.3
else right win is when it becomes really

3088.099 --> 3097.73
personal but I may get a little I don't

3095.3 --> 3101.8100000000004
know I'd like to say it's more strength

3097.73 --> 3104.72
I just take on the strict tongue a bit I

3101.81 --> 3111.65
can get a little Nathan ish like Nathan

3104.72 --> 3116.0299999999997
but he's more full into that I don't

3111.65 --> 3120.02
know I have a wide range of topics I try

3116.03 --> 3123.2000000000003
to I try to encompass as much and as

3120.02 --> 3125.54
broadly as I can but only if it is

3123.2 --> 3128.06
sensible only if I see something yeah

3125.54 --> 3130.569
viable that can come out of it you know

3128.06 --> 3134.71
to me this is like information farming

3130.569 --> 3137.18
and this is yeah not in a robot

3134.71 --> 3140.2400000000002
statistical technical sense but just

3137.18 --> 3143.1499999999996
like more in theory all sense it's like

3140.24 --> 3147.589
farming you just you try to get as much

3143.15 --> 3149.69
information find it and then yeah you do

3147.589 --> 3152.0299999999997
figure out what it does when you plant

3149.69 --> 3153.9500000000003
it like does something good crowd if it

3152.03 --> 3156.7400000000002
doesn't feed everyone or will it just

3153.95 --> 3158.24
get in the way will it bring more

3156.74 --> 3160.16
distraction that kind of thing and so

3158.24 --> 3163.7599999999998
yeah it's kind of like farming and it's

3160.16 --> 3167.21
just information weeds and there is

3163.76 --> 3169.9100000000003
information crops and I try to recognize

3167.21 --> 3172.099
the crops from the weeds as early on as

3169.91 --> 3174.8289999999997
possible because it is a process of

3172.099 --> 3177.88
figuring it out every single time new

3174.829 --> 3177.88
information comes in

3178.74 --> 3181.31
right

3202.93 --> 3205.93
heeey

3212.36 --> 3215.11
right

3216.68 --> 3226.6499999999996
no I get it stop it he's doing it for

3224.55 --> 3228.9
the principal it's about the principal

3226.65 --> 3234.23
it's not about the amount of money err

3228.9 --> 3234.23
I get it you obviously don't get it

3282.63 --> 3291.099
can we please talk about something else

3285.31 --> 3294.609
now this is not what I wanted to spend

3291.099 --> 3297.7000000000003
my Saturday on okay I'm not just

3294.609 --> 3299.43
throwing out metaphors and talking about

3297.7 --> 3303.339
the information about what we're doing

3299.43 --> 3305.3489999999997
just so you guys can just spend over an

3303.339 --> 3308.29
hour bickering back and forth about

3305.349 --> 3310.21
freaking ranty and money and [Â __Â ] and

3308.29 --> 3313.66
what is said I'm getting kind of sick of

3310.21 --> 3315.849
it and that means you two sleeping

3313.66 --> 3318.8199999999997
worried just stop being so obsessed over

3315.849 --> 3322.839
this shuts [Â __Â ] and stop getting so

3318.82 --> 3327.28
triggered at this point they are

3322.839 --> 3328.98
literally all just trolling you just

3327.28 --> 3332.53
trolling you because they're afraid

3328.98 --> 3334.9900000000002
you've you've you've engaged in some

3332.53 --> 3337.44
kind of lawful activity lawsuit activity

3334.99 --> 3340.4199999999996
or whatever it's going to be called and

3337.44 --> 3343.0
they're just [Â __Â ] their pants trying

3340.42 --> 3344.92
to do anything to make you stop make you

3343.0 --> 3346.21
look like the worst they can because

3344.92 --> 3351.55
that's what they think that can save

3346.21 --> 3353.65
their precious Randy okay that's it so

3351.55 --> 3361.3590000000004

[Music]

3384.349 --> 3389.52

3386.79 --> 3392.96
debates let's get there there yesterday

3395.64 --> 3400.3489999999997
gonna play in five minutes from now

3397.74 --> 3403.41
because I think that Nathan tends to

3400.349 --> 3405.4100000000003
premiere one of his shows after an hour

3403.41 --> 3408.27
of my first show

3405.41 --> 3412.92
just like normally when he would have

3408.27 --> 3419.78
the live show and yesterday's Flat Earth

3412.92 --> 3427.02
debate after show man holy SH it was

3419.78 --> 3432.9
five hours I think yeah five hours and

3427.02 --> 3435.42
not five hours of just silent no man

3432.9 --> 3437.7000000000003
after certain point Zanna came in it

3435.42 --> 3445.17

3437.7 --> 3451.91
and that went on for three hours three

3445.17 --> 3454.83
hours yeah the total show from pre-show

3451.91 --> 3456.56

3487.98 --> 3493.71
live it usually does somewhere between

3490.02 --> 3496.02
6:00 and 7:00 p.m. Amsterdam time and

3493.71 --> 3497.609
just like I was still in the Hangout and

3496.02 --> 3500.07
I just muted because I was getting sick

3497.609 --> 3502.3199999999997
of like sanic and Nathan just back a

3500.07 --> 3504.86
fourth thing about the same [Â __Â ] and it

3502.32 --> 3509.48
Nathan went like but like

3504.86 --> 3513.51
ballistic like in a good way

3509.48 --> 3517.59
he got so precise and that deadly

3513.51 --> 3522.03
it was almost like a surgeon facing like

3517.59 --> 3525.3
a person that was like totally psycho it

3522.03 --> 3528.3
like zanuck went totally psychotic like

3525.3 --> 3531.51
really you I pointed it out and after a

3528.3 --> 3534.0
certain point it's like that's worse

3531.51 --> 3537.6200000000003
than wrong because that's worse than

3534.0 --> 3539.88
Brenda that's like Brenda says

3537.62 --> 3544.7999999999997
doublespeak [Â __Â ] and then kind of

3539.88 --> 3548.19
hardens up you know but holy [Â __Â ]

3544.8 --> 3551.42
like he literally got confused about

3548.19 --> 3554.52
what he was saying in the moment it was

3551.42 --> 3558.51
you should see that it was amazing it

3554.52 --> 3560.96
was a bit creepy almost because I was

3558.51 --> 3563.9100000000003
getting kind of worried after a while

3560.96 --> 3565.95
was that like this like you dude you

3563.91 --> 3568.68
really need to get some help because

3565.95 --> 3572.6899999999996
this I'm getting worried like serious

3568.68 --> 3575.7
why it's not even funny anymore you know

3572.69 --> 3579.9
anyway do check that out it was very

3575.7 --> 3582.21
extreme show a lot of noise but also a

3579.9 --> 3586.77
lot of technical detail and like the

3582.21 --> 3588.87
psychology was it was every form of red

3586.77 --> 3591.57
herring and distraction and false

3588.87 --> 3596.3399999999997
equivalence you could ever imagine all

3591.57 --> 3599.67
of it it's just yeah it was a complete

3596.34 --> 3602.1000000000004
spectrum of baller nutcase machinations

3599.67 --> 3605.4900000000002
the entire picture was just that show

3602.1 --> 3608.2799999999997
about Coriolis so do check it out it was

3605.49 --> 3610.56
pretty astonishing and I missed out for

3608.28 --> 3613.17
like one and a half hour I think because

3610.56 --> 3614.52
I was watching on Benjamin life and they

3613.17 --> 3617.37
put it on mute because it was getting

3614.52 --> 3619.71
sick of it and then I went back and he

3617.37 --> 3622.35
was literally like nothing had changed I

3619.71 --> 3625.59
just unmuted it was still Nathan heretic

3622.35 --> 3628.02
or eels it's like holy [Â __Â ] didn't what

3625.59 --> 3633.44
a half hours is this literally like that

3628.02 --> 3636.96
going holy so yeah pretty amazing show

3633.44 --> 3638.25
hyping it up a lot it should I think

3636.96 --> 3640.38
it's probably gonna start

3638.25 --> 3642.15
in a minute from now so I definitely

3640.38 --> 3644.4900000000002
recommend you guys watch it I'll still

3642.15 --> 3648.3
be going for a bit if it doesn't I don't

3644.49 --> 3650.8799999999997
know when he's gonna premiere it maybe

3648.3 --> 3651.3300000000004
he'll premiere on Sunday I don't know

3650.88 --> 3654.4500000000003
for sure

3651.33 --> 3657.47
I don't think Nathan's in the check

3654.45 --> 3657.47
right now to tell us

3669.82 --> 3675.4900000000002
the right Jim Jones yeah Nathan the talk

3672.79 --> 3678.97
like a certain thing it in this case it

3675.49 --> 3683.8599999999997
was almost like he was performing brain

3678.97 --> 3686.7999999999997
surgery on an unawakened mental patient

3683.86 --> 3690.15
in a way metaphorically it was really

3686.8 --> 3695.88
much like that it it's fascinating how

3690.15 --> 3695.88
yeah how all of that transpires

3702.01 --> 3709.2400000000002
yeah in a way I don't know where he gets

3704.53 --> 3712.71
all the energy from to hold on to it for

3709.24 --> 3715.4799999999996
that long he had the room apparently

3712.71 --> 3717.34
because at first he said at some point

3715.48 --> 3718.72
that yeah his wife was gonna come back

3717.34 --> 3720.9700000000003
or something then he had to run out to

3718.72 --> 3723.3399999999997
show but dadan yeah proceeded to go on

3720.97 --> 3725.14
for another three hours or something or

3723.34 --> 3731.59
two hours I didn't know when exactly he

3725.14 --> 3733.72
said that but I complicate you're gonna

3731.59 --> 3734.67
get a timeout for that one that's too

3733.72 --> 3737.4399999999996
much

3734.67 --> 3743.02
this is absolutely ridiculous suggestion

3737.44 --> 3745.63
there I hope to god he's not I don't

3743.02 --> 3747.58
think he's that irresponsible you know

3745.63 --> 3755.4100000000003
he does have children and all that just

3747.58 --> 3769.44
don't at best he's had some extra coffee

3755.41 --> 3769.44
or something yeah that's right Jim Jones

3788.28 --> 3801.1800000000003
like 24/7 24/7 discord you mean no

3792.18 --> 3803.91
matter you okay there's no premiere

3801.18 --> 3810.3199999999997
starting up hmm

3803.91 --> 3813.12
baby's doing it later anyway

3810.32 --> 3815.04
yeah I'm Anna young I think it's it's an

3813.12 --> 3819.6
interesting place but there's some

3815.04 --> 3821.55
moderators there that that are just they

3819.6 --> 3824.16
gotta got in my way and I was like what

3821.55 --> 3826.53
the [Â __Â ] is this then oh you know I'm a

3824.16 --> 3829.02
moderator and like what who in their

3826.53 --> 3832.5
mind would make such a guy moderator

3829.02 --> 3835.14
it's just openly irresponsible but

3832.5 --> 3837.9
that's the thing I don't like about it

3835.14 --> 3840.3599999999997
but other than that when disk it's

3837.9 --> 3842.4500000000003
always that guy that really gets in my

3840.36 --> 3843.8900000000003
way for some reason he likes to mute me

3842.45 --> 3847.23
just like that

3843.89 --> 3849.21
because I'm with energy talking about

3847.23 --> 3853.5
something or addressing somebody or

3849.21 --> 3855.78
something they said and yeah that's not

3853.5 --> 3858.06
very nice but I've had great

3855.78 --> 3861.2900000000004
conversations over there about all kinds

3858.06 --> 3864.93
of things like everything from

3861.29 --> 3867.69
discussing creation and the design to

3864.93 --> 3871.1099999999997
historic details religion and the

3867.69 --> 3873.51
meaning of Christ and everything can be

3871.11 --> 3877.82
discussed over there coroner situations

3873.51 --> 3881.55
and conspiracy on the edge ideas and

3877.82 --> 3883.38
even five year and everything pretty

3881.55 --> 3885.59
much that comes up if people feel like

3883.38 --> 3885.59
it

3908.34 --> 3911.42
well dank

3913.79 --> 3920.81
I don't know if this is just rumors or

3916.43 --> 3923.41
[Â __Â ] but I've heard in general that get

3920.81 --> 3931.63
the [Â __Â ] out

3923.41 --> 3931.6299999999997
yeah I've heard in general that like

3931.66 --> 3940.91
media organization newsreaders supposed

3936.59 --> 3943.55
newsreaders and reporters are more than

3940.91 --> 3945.29
average compared to others engaged in

3943.55 --> 3947.6000000000004
the use of cocaine at times and that

3945.29 --> 3950.859
that has been going on like since the

3947.6 --> 3953.33
60s or something peaking in the eighties

3950.859 --> 3958.18
that's what I heard that's typically

3953.33 --> 3961.369
people in media that yeah but that's

3958.18 --> 3963.35
it's I'm not pointing any specific

3961.369 --> 3965.4500000000003
fingers here about it but it I did pick

3963.35 --> 3969.29
up on that over time that like yeah I

3965.45 --> 3974.33
heard these rumors about it was readers

3969.29 --> 3977.75
that use it to I guess make them all

3974.33 --> 3981.08
popped up to just lie and then talk

3977.75 --> 3983.81
mind-control [Â __Â ] without regret

3981.08 --> 3985.7
because I think that cocaine tends to do

3983.81 --> 3988.04
that it tends to make you very dominant

3985.7 --> 3990.56
and not care about the effect that

3988.04 --> 3994.43
you're going to have or something I've

3990.56 --> 3997.54
never personally used it but I have seen

3994.43 --> 4001.95
people on it and like how they other

3997.54 --> 4001.95
stances in the [Â __Â ] so

4004.13 --> 4009.42
and I've heard that it inspires and

4007.05 --> 4011.52
inspires not necessarily puts into

4009.42 --> 4018.7200000000003
physical action but inspires aggression

4011.52 --> 4020.7599999999998
also with a lot of people so makes you

4018.72 --> 4023.97
extremely selfish right well that will

4020.76 --> 4027.03
do it that would definitely do it yeah

4023.97 --> 4029.39
this is I don't even want to imagine

4027.03 --> 4033.1200000000003
what it would be like to be on that [Â __Â ]

4029.39 --> 4037.31
so contra opposite to what everything

4033.12 --> 4040.02
that I my energy it would be like an

4037.31 --> 4042.56
inside out evil or win or something I I

4040.02 --> 4049.13
don't even want to fantasize about it

4042.56 --> 4049.13
yeah needs that [Â __Â ] anyway

4057.3 --> 4062.28
you know in a way I think I'm already

4059.64 --> 4063.81
selfish enough now that doesn't mean

4062.28 --> 4067.02
that I think that I'm on average I'm

4063.81 --> 4069.24
very selfish but I think that I'm

4067.02 --> 4071.16
selfish enough so the idea that some

4069.24 --> 4075.6299999999997
kind of drug would make me more selfish

4071.16 --> 4079.0499999999997
it's just a terrible idea especially

4075.63 --> 4082.17
when it wears off you start to care

4079.05 --> 4083.52
about basically the [Â __Â ] that's happened

4082.17 --> 4087.63
that you didn't care about so your legs

4083.52 --> 4088.02
slip yeah it's not a good way to do

4087.63 --> 4094.82
things

4088.02 --> 4094.82
Oh Flat Earth debate started up

4099.17 --> 4102.31
[Music]

4114.06 --> 4123.0
uh let me check it out this is

4118.2 --> 4126.08
premiering now right I have to manually

4123.0 --> 4126.08
look it up of course

4136.069 --> 4143.660000000001
right yeah it's on the Nathan Oakley

4139.4 --> 4147.41
90-80 channel I'll link it in check but

4143.66 --> 4151.67
it's probably gonna be the free show as

4147.41 --> 4153.23
well yeah what you could be considered

4151.67 --> 4160.9
kind of boring because I'm not a part of

4153.23 --> 4163.879999999999
it mmm see I'm already selfish enough

4160.9 --> 4165.679999999999
but I'll put it in the chat for people

4163.88 --> 4170.35
so they can find it directly if they

4165.68 --> 4173.0
want to go to it but yeah oh this yeah

4170.35 --> 4174.1
I'll at least go on for another half

4173.0 --> 4176.42
hour

4174.1 --> 4187.7300000000005
don't worry about I'm not running out to

4176.42 --> 4191.68
show yet but yeah don't forget to go

4187.73 --> 4191.679999999999
there because it was a pretty epic show

4192.46 --> 4199.94
wow we have never tried pot that that's

4196.28 --> 4202.42
kind of rare a lot of people try it at

4199.94 --> 4202.419999999999
least once

4212.429 --> 4219.81
anyway uh yeah Tony I kind of forgot but

4217.53 --> 4224.699
I I was gonna have Tony on the show if

4219.81 --> 4227.280000000001
you want although I'm afraid he'll just

4224.699 --> 4233.07
start talking about more ranting

4227.28 --> 4235.13
situations at this point you do that

4233.07 --> 4238.46
okay cool

4235.13 --> 4241.86
well as long as it works out for you

4238.46 --> 4251.55
because pot can also bring certain types

4241.86 --> 4253.71
of people into trouble especially you

4251.55 --> 4256.71
like when they're younger when they're

4253.71 --> 4261.35
not used to it you know you can get you

4256.71 --> 4263.909
can totally influence you it's very ya

4261.35 --> 4267.33
familiar phenomena about the super

4263.909 --> 4270.989
stoned person that's like yeah that's

4267.33 --> 4278.28
real that's really like that it's not a

4270.989 --> 4281.04
stereotype it can happen or yeah and

4278.28 --> 4284.759999999999
typical things is that people can get

4281.04 --> 4288.33
like in a total eating frenzy mood from

4284.76 --> 4291.51
it or get into a super squirt mode so

4288.33 --> 4296.87
also familiar and like a lot of people

4291.51 --> 4298.77
have like extra sexual I'm sure from it

4296.87 --> 4306.929
recommend you don't do it on your own

4298.77 --> 4309.3
and yeah it has a lot of influences and

4306.929 --> 4311.1900000000005
for some people they don't like it they

4309.3 --> 4313.62
don't like it at all or they it makes

4311.19 --> 4317.04
them kind of do things that are not good

4313.62 --> 4318.17
for them and then yeah why would you

4317.04 --> 4323.699
want to do it

4318.17 --> 4326.55
you know for me cannabis was was really

4323.699 --> 4330.21
a salvation in a way because it it

4326.55 --> 4335.33
calmed me the [Â __Â ] down socially because

4330.21 --> 4338.1
before that I was like I felt I was a

4335.33 --> 4340.23
like a slightly more intelligent prey

4338.1 --> 4342.06
animal in a dangerous world that's just

4340.23 --> 4344.879999999999
how it felt socially I felt like

4342.06 --> 4345.63
somebody could just end any moment just

4344.88 --> 4350.13
choose

4345.63 --> 4353.01
to attack me like that no well yeah

4350.13 --> 4356.16
psychologically and follow that up with

4353.01 --> 4358.95
like really brutal [Â __Â ] because I have

4356.16 --> 4361.2
experienced some of that not like real

4358.95 --> 4365.87
extreme physical violence but yeah

4361.2 --> 4368.79
enough to be freaking intimidating and

4365.87 --> 4372.96
yeah then when cannabis kind of slipped

4368.79 --> 4375.69
in there through threads it literally

4372.96 --> 4380.37
made me forgot all of that and it just

4375.69 --> 4382.2
was like hey I'm thinking about this and

4380.37 --> 4385.76
this and that where before I would never

4382.2 --> 4389.82
share what I was thinking it lit

4385.76 --> 4393.45
cannabis you could say triggered me from

4389.82 --> 4394.98
being able to speak effectively so just

4393.45 --> 4398.0
started talking what I was thinking

4394.98 --> 4400.5599999999995
about it because before that I just

4398.0 --> 4405.11
didn't do that because I was afraid that

4400.56 --> 4405.110000000001
if I talked it would offend somebody a

4405.41 --> 4415.0199999999995
lot but not offend them a lot but they

4412.38 --> 4418.650000000001
would always be offended in some way so

4415.02 --> 4422.96
I just yeah but then now I'm talking

4418.65 --> 4422.96
about like my early teens and [Â __Â ] that

4423.5 --> 4429.87
first tried it if I remember correctly

4426.15 --> 4432.8099999999995
when I was 15 and that's when yeah

4429.87 --> 4436.95
that's when I started to learn how to

4432.81 --> 4438.870000000001
speak and to reason out and became

4436.95 --> 4441.09
actually interested in language where

4438.87 --> 4445.47
before that I just didn't care about

4441.09 --> 4447.84
language at all except for English

4445.47 --> 4449.070000000001
because I wanted to understand what they

4447.84 --> 4458.85
were saying in the really awesome

4449.07 --> 4460.88
cartoons and all that and the movies of

4458.85 --> 4460.88
course

4468.639 --> 4471.329
hmm

4472.2 --> 4478.62
all right yeah I have it well some

4476.07 --> 4480.63
people like the smell others find it

4478.62 --> 4481.98
extremely repulsive so you got to keep

4480.63 --> 4483.27
that in mind that's just people out

4481.98 --> 4484.98
there that really don't like it

4483.27 --> 4486.75
especially certain types of people that

4484.98 --> 4491.94
are regularly on pharmaceutical

4486.75 --> 4493.83
medication because in my general

4491.94 --> 4496.049999999999
experience from what I've seen other

4493.83 --> 4502.86
people using pharmaceutical medication

4496.05 --> 4506.34
is that it yeah smelled rotation taste

4502.86 --> 4511.65
rotation that sometimes tends to happen

4506.34 --> 4514.08
with a variety of pharmaceuticals it can

4511.65 --> 4515.91
literally just ruin your entire life

4514.08 --> 4519.84
experience if you think you all need

4515.91 --> 4522.12
that like well I can't imagine you oh

4519.84 --> 4523.860000000001
you have to take this and then you're

4522.12 --> 4530.4
just gonna lose your freaking sense of

4523.86 --> 4532.2
smell or something yeah terrible not

4530.4 --> 4533.7
saying that all pharmaceuticals do that

4532.2 --> 4538.7
it's just that something that I picked

4533.7 --> 4546.389999999999
up on like typical symptoms and sensory

4538.7 --> 4549.17
rotation being among them sometimes yeah

4546.39 --> 4556.280000000001
and cannabis by the way does not do that

4549.17 --> 4559.53
at all can do however is amplify the

4556.28 --> 4561.8
yeah the sensory experience including

4559.53 --> 4561.8
taste

4571.16 --> 4578.79
anyway enough about cannabis I don't

4575.01 --> 4581.1
want to advertise for cannabis check

4578.79 --> 4585.63
your quality of the canopy is make sure

4581.1 --> 4587.97
it's organically produced because you

4585.63 --> 4589.74
don't want any pesticides or that kind

4587.97 --> 4592.610000000001
of nonsense in between there or bad

4589.74 --> 4592.61
fertilizers

4604.32 --> 4610.38
oh good for you we have a hey as long as

4606.36 --> 4610.98
nobody's bothered by it I'm I'm all for

4610.38 --> 4613.079
it you know

4610.98 --> 4615.558999999999
I try not to bother people with my

4613.079 --> 4615.558999999999
smoking habits

4630.13 --> 4634.95
your drug is guitar cool

4641.26 --> 4649.9400000000005
yeah well a drug for me also is music

4645.35 --> 4652.85
very much but I just learned to dosage

4649.94 --> 4655.869
it carefully because it can mesmerize it

4652.85 --> 4660.9400000000005
me over time if I listen to much of it

4655.869 --> 4665.2699999999995
because I do like really intense music

4660.94 --> 4670.79
like there's several grades of intense

4665.27 --> 4673.219
but I do like yeah in melodically

4670.79 --> 4675.59
impactful music you could consider it

4673.219 --> 4677.75
especially in the electronic scene so

4675.59 --> 4681.5
you know then there's going to be a very

4677.75 --> 4686.119
deep detailed spectrum of sound and I

4681.5 --> 4688.219
love that stuff can totally put me in

4686.119 --> 4691.699
the zone very easy I often listen some

4688.219 --> 4693.01
of the songs before I start to show to

4691.699 --> 4695.75
get me there

4693.01 --> 4697.52
but if you listen to much of it and like

4695.75 --> 4700.699
if you listen like two hours straight

4697.52 --> 4704.06
that type of music then I will become

4700.699 --> 4710.9
sick of it like physically it's like too

4704.06 --> 4714.1900000000005
much too much sensory input I guess what

4710.9 --> 4719.57
I do love to listen some music

4714.19 --> 4723.32
periodically yeah back in the day you

4719.57 --> 4725.36
know 20 years ago I had times when I

4723.32 --> 4727.849999999999
would just put on certain type of CD and

4725.36 --> 4733.46
just put it on repeat and then listen it

4727.85 --> 4736.639
for six hours and [Â __Â ] and I can't do

4733.46 --> 4739.2390000000005
that anymore I can't handle that type of

4736.639 --> 4742.369
impact on the senses anymore

4739.239 --> 4744.678999999999
it makes me nauseated and in the same

4742.369 --> 4748.699
way you could compare it sensory

4744.679 --> 4751.52
overload it's kind of similar to 3d

4748.699 --> 4753.619
shooters because I explained before like

4751.52 --> 4757.34
it back in the day when I was still a

4753.619 --> 4760.969
teenager I played things like quake 2

4757.34 --> 4763.25
and quake 3 earlier 3d shooters were

4760.969 --> 4766.19
pretty decent it's pretty fluid and it

4763.25 --> 4769.34
was like wow 3d [Â __Â ] man was so real

4766.19 --> 4770.699
interactive and I had a great time

4769.34 --> 4773.159000000001
played that for hours

4770.699 --> 4776.848999999999
well but then after certain point I

4773.159 --> 4781.619
think it was like 24

4776.849 --> 4785.719
I think the newer 3d games it became too

4781.619 --> 4788.429
much and it started to become like feel

4785.719 --> 4791.639
I'm comfortable in my stomach literally

4788.429 --> 4796.619
there it's like the nerves of the plexus

4791.639 --> 4798.51
is like mmm it's like not good and this

4796.619 --> 4802.409
became worse and worse and worse and now

4798.51 --> 4805.9490000000005
I never play 3d games again and they

4802.409 --> 4809.219
never even watch other people play those

4805.949 --> 4812.969
types of games because it makes me

4809.219 --> 4814.409
nauseated and I think it is it has to do

4812.969 --> 4816.78
with the specific type of sensory

4814.409 --> 4820.888999999999
overload which that presents for a

4816.78 --> 4824.55
certain visual mechanic in the mind

4820.889 --> 4827.09
that's trying to size up 3d it's

4824.55 --> 4831.26
basically sensory overload of that

4827.09 --> 4837.269
function so it can be considered similar

4831.26 --> 4841.4400000000005
in a way as to the listening too much

4837.269 --> 4844.289000000001
intense music it's also a form of just

4841.44 --> 4846.9
too much input to resolve all the

4844.289 --> 4848.969
feelings and the the ideas that come

4846.9 --> 4851.789
with it and if you do that too much

4848.969 --> 4856.289
it'll also just numb you down and make

4851.789 --> 4858.59
you sick I think yeah too much of

4856.289 --> 4861.7699999999995
everything is never a good thing

4858.59 --> 4861.77
[Music]

4871.349 --> 4883.079
it's religion a perversion of

4873.539 --> 4885.289
spirituality yeah yeah yeah I guess it

4883.079 --> 4885.289
is

4890.729 --> 4897.7390000000005
but yeah but the issue though is that

4893.729 --> 4901.9490000000005
spirituality is is technically very

4897.739 --> 4905.159
flexible and religion does give like our

4901.949 --> 4909.03
attempts to bring moral guidelines moral

4905.159 --> 4913.228999999999
standards and spirituality does not

4909.03 --> 4916.619
necessarily do that in general

4913.229 --> 4920.070000000001
spirituality in general it's really up

4916.619 --> 4922.199
to the person so that's why instead I'd

4920.07 --> 4925.32
say now if you just make it a personal

4922.199 --> 4930.869
religion like a religion that only you

4925.32 --> 4936.959
can follow but that you will use yet to

4930.869 --> 4939.719
guide you and to interact like that with

4936.959 --> 4941.459
others and then kind of encourage them

4939.719 --> 4943.499
to do the same thing like having your

4941.459 --> 4947.519
own religion is like to me taking

4943.499 --> 4950.19
spiritual responsibility giving

4947.519 --> 4953.070000000001
principles and a code of conduct like it

4950.19 --> 4955.558999999999
is the religion that you would want you

4953.07 --> 4957.209
do that to the best of your abilities

4955.559 --> 4961.789
and then realize that that's the only

4957.209 --> 4961.789
way any of it could ever come true

4975.22 --> 4980.46
because if it's just just spirituality

4978.31 --> 4984.52
just being busy with spiritual things

4980.46 --> 4987.19
well that means you can still be dragged

4984.52 --> 4991.240000000001
off tour wondered off by some curiosity

4987.19 --> 4994.0599999999995
of the day into wherever you know you

4991.24 --> 4997.3
might miss out on a lot because you

4994.06 --> 4999.580000000001
could be distracted by things that if

4997.3 --> 5002.04
you had proper moral guidelines an

4999.58 --> 5003.87
oversight that comes with at least a

5002.04 --> 5005.31
personal religion and maybe some other

5003.87 --> 5007.7699999999995
religions although they take away

5005.31 --> 5014.780000000001
insights as well like so terrorize

5007.77 --> 5017.64
things then yeah you yeah you miss out

5014.78 --> 5024.5599999999995
because you don't have the guidelines to

5017.64 --> 5024.56
help you prevent obstacles early on

5025.46 --> 5034.05
spiritually so yeah religion what is a

5031.71 --> 5037.44
religion religion as an institute is

5034.05 --> 5040.5
never really a good thing the religious

5037.44 --> 5042.15
institutions all have vast amounts of

5040.5 --> 5047.34
problems that are becoming more and more

5042.15 --> 5052.23
apparent and yeah and then there are

5047.34 --> 5055.2
spirituality from the what is it the the

5052.23 --> 5059.94
Western freedom thinking kind of people

5055.2 --> 5064.8
the the hippies the New Agers and tying

5059.94 --> 5068.4
into foreign foreign Eastern religions

5064.8 --> 5070.29
like a new religion so all kinds of

5068.4 --> 5072.15
things can tie into that elements

5070.29 --> 5073.65
grafting in elements of all kinds of

5072.15 --> 5076.53
things it's kind of what I do in a way

5073.65 --> 5079.379999999999
as well but still yeah the the Western

5076.53 --> 5084.259999999999
base type of base situation doesn't

5079.38 --> 5084.26
necessarily give base moral lights

5084.8 --> 5087.8
because

5087.84 --> 5093.24
yeah just because of how Western society

5090.81 --> 5095.910000000001
has become and like people are not being

5093.24 --> 5105.03
forced to do that basically it's not

5095.91 --> 5106.889999999999
mandatory because yeah because that's

5105.03 --> 5109.679999999999
the way it's become the only way it can

5106.89 --> 5113.22
be mandatory is through spiritual

5109.68 --> 5116.1
consensus everybody agrees that it must

5113.22 --> 5118.76
be like that well at the moment it's

5116.1 --> 5124.5
like a free-for-all crazy house in a way

5118.76 --> 5126.72
so that makes spirituality more whiskey

5124.5 --> 5127.92
because you can fall for traps much more

5126.72 --> 5130.2
easily because there are a lot of traps

5127.92 --> 5133.2300000000005
around and you don't have the proper

5130.2 --> 5135.929999999999
baseline moral guidance even though you

5133.23 --> 5137.73
might be going on spiritual journeys you

5135.93 --> 5141.030000000001
can distinguish properly because

5137.73 --> 5143.549999999999
probably more fixated on the technical

5141.03 --> 5147.8099999999995
differences in the levels and just the

5143.55 --> 5150.06
functionality instead of the overarching

5147.81 --> 5155.1900000000005
spiritual of gee spiritual the

5150.06 --> 5158.370000000001
overarching moral situation although it

5155.19 --> 5161.099999999999
differs for a person of course and a lot

5158.37 --> 5164.09
of people spiritual people have moral

5161.1 --> 5166.4400000000005
guidelines from their own family roots

5164.09 --> 5168.51
it's just a personal thing and that's

5166.44 --> 5172.86
good because a religion should be

5168.51 --> 5175.17
personal it should be your principles

5172.86 --> 5178.46
your guide your frequency that you

5175.17 --> 5185.42
should be very carefully maintaining and

5178.46 --> 5188.6
refining and doing that for yourself and

5185.42 --> 5191.52
that's the way to properly manage

5188.6 --> 5193.83
spirituality because if you don't have

5191.52 --> 5198.990000000001
some kind of moral guidance some kind of

5193.83 --> 5200.88
roots yeah you could easily falter and

5198.99 --> 5205.04
be seduced into the darkness without

5200.88 --> 5205.04
even realizing it anyway

5216.84 --> 5223.47
I don't know maybe my point is just oh

5221.18 --> 5224.64
wait I was looking in the wrong chat I

5223.47 --> 5225.900000000001
thought what does all this troll

5224.64 --> 5230.34
comments but that's the Flat Earth

5225.9 --> 5233.509999999999
debate and after cat this is no you know

5230.34 --> 5233.51
I'm looking at my own chat again

5250.17 --> 5256.36
it's a bit of an overgeneralization

5252.31 --> 5258.6900000000005
there juris hanford but it's just called

5256.36 --> 5261.69
organized religion it's these

5258.69 --> 5261.69
organizations

5275.449 --> 5283.549999999999
it's basically organizations that are

5279.55 --> 5286.37
pertaining to handle the religious

5283.55 --> 5290.29
details for other people that's what a

5286.37 --> 5293.32
priesthood does they take over the

5290.29 --> 5299.69
responsibility for whatever reason

5293.32 --> 5304.82
that's just how it's said but therefore

5299.69 --> 5308.419999999999
yeah by that the people engaging in the

5304.82 --> 5309.92
such a system because they surrender

5308.42 --> 5314.2390000000005
their responsibilities to the priesthood

5309.92 --> 5318.62
they don't again they give it to

5314.239 --> 5323.919999999999
something else they give away there was

5318.62 --> 5323.92
it there's their spiritual

5323.98 --> 5331.4
responsibility to the priest to tell

5327.5 --> 5334.94
them instead of struggling to figure it

5331.4 --> 5336.32
out for themselves that's what they

5334.94 --> 5338.049999999999
really should be doing that's what

5336.32 --> 5342.639999999999
everybody should be doing at all times

5338.05 --> 5346.78
but yeah we're just used to systems and

5342.64 --> 5353.150000000001
organizations that provide a lot of easy

5346.78 --> 5355.94
go along to get along roads for us to

5353.15 --> 5358.37
walk and when you get used to that you

5355.94 --> 5360.98
start to think it's common and then you

5358.37 --> 5364.03
forget that it's actually taking

5360.98 --> 5364.03
something away from you

5367.9 --> 5373.69
takes away the attention on figuring out

5371.29 --> 5378.31
something important and giving it over

5373.69 --> 5380.44
to the priesthood kind of taking away a

5378.31 --> 5383.280000000001
life lesson or the potential for a life

5380.44 --> 5390.159
lesson to a degree it's complicated

5383.28 --> 5393.07
being being very ethereal there but I'm

5390.159 --> 5397.179
