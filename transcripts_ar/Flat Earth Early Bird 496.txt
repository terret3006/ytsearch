76.35 --> 85.759
late yeah just have to do some stuff

82.34 --> 92.46000000000001
today the weather is kind of cloudy I

85.759 --> 97.05
haven't really seen any Sun but I don't

92.46 --> 100.55999999999999
know it's there's no wind so it's still

97.05 --> 107.179
kind of ok a little bit more fresh I

100.56 --> 107.179
guess what yeah no ring

108.039 --> 116.99000000000001
right so yeah I got mint tea with me

114.32 --> 119.119
because I discovered this morning that I

116.99 --> 122.0
ran out of regular tea I thought I had

119.119 --> 126.319
an extra package back up but I didn't so

122.0 --> 128.479
I don't know gotta have one we're gonna

126.319 --> 133.64000000000001
get some later on didn't get any

128.479 --> 139.48000000000002
groceries just yet because I it was

133.64 --> 139.48
relative up relatively late not too late

141.61 --> 149.56900000000002
but yeah I got some financial stuff that

145.22 --> 154.25
I had to work out this morning and I

149.569 --> 155.81
like I pretty much discovered it half an

154.25 --> 157.519
hour before the show and I kind of had

155.81 --> 162.049
to do it because I couldn't just let

157.519 --> 164.15
that sit make me Restless because there

162.049 --> 166.28
was like a time limit up until tomorrow

164.15 --> 168.37900000000002
so I was like no I'm not gonna allow

166.28 --> 171.049
myself to accidentally forget that or

168.379 --> 173.81
whatever I'm gonna do it right now but

171.049 --> 176.359
yeah that cost me a little bit extra

173.81 --> 177.44
time than I thought it would anyway

176.359 --> 182.95000000000002
sorry for being late

177.44 --> 185.9
again I'm here let's see it was in Chad

182.95 --> 190.819
dank was first and he got a notification

185.9 --> 195.709
good to hear more colored he didn't

190.819 --> 199.89999999999998
apparently I'm a new young George

195.709 --> 199.9
Sanford at Sabbath

201.489 --> 221.2
Walter dinosaur Falcon tiny bumble Steve

212.159 --> 226.709
yeah good to see you all you saw my

221.2 --> 226.709
video in your subs okay

228.97 --> 237.26
right because that is kind of another

233.12 --> 239.45000000000002
thing right like in the main in your

237.26 --> 242.14999999999998
main YouTube page there's like the list

239.45 --> 245.63
of subscribers and you're supposed to

242.15 --> 248.48000000000002
see it being on top with a red dot right

245.63 --> 251.93
next to it when it is running live but

248.48 --> 255.14
for some reason sometimes it just

251.93 --> 258.709
doesn't show that or it like start

255.14 --> 260.78
showing that very late for some reason

258.709 --> 264.41
it happens to Nathan Oakley's channel as

260.78 --> 266.45
well for me so I have to like dig into

264.41 --> 268.28000000000003
the channel in order to get the live

266.45 --> 271.55
stream because it just refuses to show

268.28 --> 275.41999999999996
on the side it's kind of annoying but I

271.55 --> 278.83
guess it's like it's just it's not

275.42 --> 280.1
completely off it's just chaotic it's

278.83 --> 281.93
yeah

280.1 --> 283.58000000000004
doesn't know point to that by the way

281.93 --> 286.46
it's just doesn't make any sense it just

283.58 --> 290.16999999999996
makes the look the system look crappy

286.46 --> 290.16999999999996
for no good reason

298.16 --> 315.77000000000004
all right anyway yeah good to see you

300.32 --> 318.62
all 25:26 watching gideon sick oh my

315.77 --> 323.53
love streams okay

318.62 --> 323.53000000000003
dinosaur falcon hello John John Mack

327.95 --> 335.27
I'd be interested to hear where all of

332.0 --> 338.81
you guys are coming from basically

335.27 --> 341.41999999999996
because well a lot of you I've known to

338.81 --> 343.52
be here for a while but I never really

341.42 --> 346.46000000000004
inquired you know it's like oh sometimes

343.52 --> 348.83
people bring it up like I guess a lot of

346.46 --> 353.51
you did get to me through the debates

348.83 --> 355.28
but I don't know sometimes when there's

353.51 --> 356.57
new people around it's just like oh

355.28 --> 359.96
they're chatting like they've always

356.57 --> 367.34
been there but it's like yeah how did

359.96 --> 369.34999999999997
you stumble upon my channel or have you

367.34 --> 371.45
been following it for a while and just

369.35 --> 376.34000000000003
saying hello right now and I don't know

371.45 --> 379.72999999999996
I get kind of curious to that I guess

376.34 --> 381.89
that with all the traffic towards our

379.73 --> 386.39000000000004
channels my channel and Nathan's and all

381.89 --> 388.96999999999997
that is being I don't know stifled I'm

386.39 --> 392.84
just more curious as to how people roll

388.97 --> 395.93
in to my channel because I wonder then

392.84 --> 401.47999999999996
why how did they get to my channel and

395.93 --> 404.0
other people did not oh yeah by the way

401.48 --> 406.13
did you also noticed it was just so

404.0 --> 412.67
often it's not hate hello Major Tom by

406.13 --> 415.31
the way was so off microwork that

412.67 --> 419.35
yesterday stream it's kind of it's doing

415.31 --> 422.0
it right now you know I I could just

419.35 --> 423.86
thinking why not I could just share it I

422.0 --> 424.99
could just show you exactly what I'm

423.86 --> 431.42
seeing

424.99 --> 432.88
see Firefox okay yeah I guess it's gonna

431.42 --> 437.08000000000004
get it a bit loopy

432.88 --> 437.08
okay I'll scroll down a bit

442.15 --> 454.65999999999997
all right so here to the right of my

446.62 --> 455.65
screen or to the left or is it 30 for

454.66 --> 458.91900000000004
watching right now

455.65 --> 462.03999999999996
and you got this for up for 25 download

458.919 --> 464.02
and at the end of the show up until an

462.04 --> 466.6
hour at least I haven't checked and

464.02 --> 469.0
maybe I should check again it just said

466.6 --> 472.09000000000003
that like no no it's going to be three

469.0 --> 474.34
downloads or three uploads and that's it

472.09 --> 479.4
even though there were a lot of people

474.34 --> 481.96
in Chad yesterday oh look it's five oh

479.4 --> 484.78
it's almost like oh if now oh look at

481.96 --> 487.35999999999996
how it goes if enough people are looking

484.78 --> 491.169
then suddenly you know now it's on

487.36 --> 494.56
record it's it's almost like the

491.169 --> 496.87
trickery is kind of trying to stay

494.56 --> 498.94
covert and hiding itself see now now

496.87 --> 500.77
it's going up this is like double the

498.94 --> 509.83
total amount of up votes I had yesterday

500.77 --> 512.7289999999999
eight yeah yeah let's let's do that with

509.83 --> 514.7189999999999
yesterday's footage video let's see

512.729 --> 519.87
let's see where it goes

514.719 --> 522.729
just life exploring my own channel

519.87 --> 529.7090000000001
alright yesterday's video what does it

522.729 --> 532.7090000000001
say here see this see two up votes

529.709 --> 532.709
yesterday

533.52 --> 538.11
how does that make any sense with a

535.77 --> 539.61
hundred sixty-four views which doesn't

538.11 --> 548.7
make a lot of sense to because I thought

539.61 --> 552.11
it was probably more all right see but

548.7 --> 552.11
but you can see this right

556.56 --> 566.31
so yeah ha ha ha very funny Google very

562.11 --> 573.86
funny April Fool's joke haha nobody

566.31 --> 582.1199999999999
liked the video so funny it's also funny

573.86 --> 585.089
anyway right ok so we got more collar

582.12 --> 590.029
George Sanford over mukou okay that's

585.089 --> 590.0290000000001
three upvotes wide it only said to see

590.629 --> 594.11
make no sense

598.85 --> 604.759
right so yeah this blatant obvious proof

602.749 --> 608.179
that these stats are being manipulated

604.759 --> 613.999
and for what reason why would it be so

608.179 --> 618.249
important is it because YouTube knows

613.999 --> 621.4590000000001
that because of the quarantine situation

618.249 --> 625.309
combined with April Fool's it's

621.459 --> 627.829
extremely likely extremely likely that

625.309 --> 630.399
like the amount of people that are gonna

627.829 --> 633.9789999999999
do YouTube searches is gonna a

630.399 --> 635.749
hundredfold or thousandfold maybe that

633.979 --> 637.489
is the reason why they were just like

635.749 --> 642.169
okay absolutely

637.489 --> 643.549
minimize it to the maximum extent even

642.169 --> 647.329
though it doesn't make any sense what's

643.549 --> 651.019
gonna look like just make sure that they

647.329 --> 654.4699999999999
don't get any single advantage from the

651.019 --> 657.229
insane YouTube inquiries out there

654.47 --> 659.629
because of the April Fool's situation

657.229 --> 663.9390000000001
and I did name the title of the video

659.629 --> 663.939
you know April Fool's as all

666.89 --> 676.06
so two up votes that's it

670.94 --> 680.9000000000001
I guess maybe because my video was not a

676.06 --> 682.43
I'm funny it's all wrong and I'm a globe

680.9 --> 686.4499999999999
or now yeah I could have made yesterday

682.43 --> 689.0899999999999
into I'm a globe or now show but I don't

686.45 --> 695.21
know it almost feels like is that really

689.09 --> 698.47
worth it this I don't think it would

695.21 --> 698.47
have been even that funny

704.41 --> 710.5
no Major Tom it did not have any sink

707.56 --> 714.0699999999999
well yeah there is one thing that it did

710.5 --> 717.22
affect me through my friends great the

714.07 --> 721.8100000000001
D&D group because yeah one of them

717.22 --> 726.49
Swedish and he's like he said like yeah

721.81 --> 728.6199999999999
sorry the government ordered social

726.49 --> 731.32
distancing blah blah like that just like

728.62 --> 734.5
that I said like yeah I'm not gonna meet

731.32 --> 736.75
until June one like but I have my room

734.5 --> 739.21
available now we can finally meet we

736.75 --> 743.65
don't have to go to a public place could

739.21 --> 745.87
just be the four of us five no I'm gonna

743.65 --> 749.16
wait until June 1 he's just gonna sit

745.87 --> 752.29
there and do almost nothing apparently I

749.16 --> 754.5699999999999
didn't really feel like trying to do D&D

752.29 --> 761.5
over this court even though they

754.57 --> 764.8900000000001
suggested it because I don't wanna I

761.5 --> 770.95
want to meet them face to face i I want

764.89 --> 772.96
to see them up close as I'm playing as

770.95 --> 778.8100000000001
I'm gay mastering otherwise it's gonna

772.96 --> 781.21
detach me it's gonna distract me so I'd

778.81 --> 784.03
only do that maybe partially if like

781.21 --> 786.46
somebody could not join but they they

784.03 --> 788.74
really would want to that they could

786.46 --> 790.96
then join as a computer screen basically

788.74 --> 793.9
while there's still other players here

790.96 --> 796.3000000000001
then it could work much better but if

793.9 --> 799.63
everyone does that then there's just no

796.3 --> 802.1099999999999
more real contact like that just I'm not

799.63 --> 802.11
gonna do it

818.81 --> 824.06
okay yeah gasps man I had certain points

822.65 --> 827.03
where I did get a hundred viewers

824.06 --> 830.42
especially when I had a prominent

827.03 --> 833.9
youtubers honor as panelists when I had

830.42 --> 838.55
them on skype over then they sometimes

833.9 --> 840.53
drew a big crowd that's right and I

838.55 --> 843.37
don't know what it is now but I don't

840.53 --> 846.02
really care that much though gasps man

843.37 --> 851.36
whoever you're supposed to be probably a

846.02 --> 854.03
troll I did go over to the chat in fight

851.36 --> 856.72
to flood earth yesterday with Tony for

854.03 --> 860.12
last I stuck around a little bit longer

856.72 --> 863.48
and I created some severely allergic

860.12 --> 866.48
responses in there of course because

863.48 --> 869.78
yeah they've never had me there before I

866.48 --> 872.96
was pleasantly surprised that they had

869.78 --> 875.3
kind of a Nathan Oakley chat policy and

872.96 --> 879.11
that literally just there was no timing

875.3 --> 882.88
out really I was surprised that that I

879.11 --> 886.22
was just being able to do what I did

882.88 --> 888.62
continually without anybody timing me

886.22 --> 890.69
out or anything yeah so that yeah that

888.62 --> 895.91
was kind of fun I guess but yet the

890.69 --> 899.84
Hangout itself was just ridiculous with

895.91 --> 902.51
a rant e-everybody way thank you a good

899.84 --> 904.69
servant for the nickel much appreciate

902.51 --> 904.6899999999999
it

916.589 --> 921.61
but yeah yeah I may have had at some

919.72 --> 923.529
point a hundred viewers you know that

921.61 --> 928.66
there would be nice you know it's like

923.529 --> 931.06
okay technically the success of YouTube

928.66 --> 935.86
is measured by the amount of people that

931.06 --> 939.6389999999999
watch you now I don't seem to be I'm

935.86 --> 942.25
like a I I'm pretty much statistically a

939.639 --> 944.949
bottom-of-the-barrel youtuber you know

942.25 --> 948.939
it's like oh this guy yeah he does it

944.949 --> 951.639
every day but yes well nothing is is

948.939 --> 956.92
lucky TCB's even monetized you know why

951.639 --> 959.97
doesn't he get any strikes right but the

956.92 --> 964.56
thing is I get so many people in chat

959.97 --> 968.379
that that really support me and all that

964.56 --> 971.319
so yeah the success rate of YouTube as a

968.379 --> 973.779
youtuber I guess I'm I'm not even

971.319 --> 976.269
looking at that anymore not really I do

973.779 --> 978.209
look at it and then I think like wow

976.269 --> 981.819
okay

978.209 --> 983.529
like somebody up there not talking about

981.819 --> 987.2199999999999
God somebody up there in the system

983.529 --> 989.949
doesn't like me well they shouldn't in a

987.22 --> 994.1800000000001
way it's like yeah I guess that's a

989.949 --> 996.8789999999999
proper response to what I do because

994.18 --> 997.809
even though I do get a little weird

996.879 --> 1002.309
sometimes

997.809 --> 1004.439
I have yeah certain character traits

1002.309 --> 1007.17
that are kind of I don't know

1004.439 --> 1009.389
off-putting to some people but I do my

1007.17 --> 1012.18
best and all that so I get a little

1009.389 --> 1014.339
nutty but overall the quality of

1012.18 --> 1018.3
information in my insight and just the

1014.339 --> 1021.5690000000001
way I conduct myself I should realize

1018.3 --> 1026.37
that it is just my existence me doing

1021.569 --> 1030.449
what I do is kind of a threat it's it's

1026.37 --> 1034.9189999999999
like a little place where a lot of

1030.449 --> 1037.47
things out there are dispelled kind of

1034.919 --> 1040.0490000000002
like what Big Bear does maybe a little

1037.47 --> 1042.24
less sacred cow slaughter house style

1040.049 --> 1044.8799999999999
like he does he's a comedian of course

1042.24 --> 1046.47
I'm not really a comedian I utilize some

1044.88 --> 1053.279
jokes

1046.47 --> 1056.549
funny moments I'm not a comedian but

1053.279 --> 1058.98
yeah it's still a threat in general so I

1056.549 --> 1061.95
completely understand that my channels

1058.98 --> 1064.8890000000001
been choked from the start I'm in a way

1061.95 --> 1073.8600000000001
almost like happy that they even gave me

1064.889 --> 1078.24
the chance to monetize at all but yeah

1073.86 --> 1080.1589999999999
my personal success I I feel I've come a

1078.24 --> 1081.84
long way there are so many people in

1080.159 --> 1085.6390000000001
chat there's so many people in chat that

1081.84 --> 1089.759
know me that support me financially

1085.639 --> 1092.1899999999998
verbally and in other chats I see so

1089.759 --> 1095.549
many people even defending me when I get

1092.19 --> 1100.23
I don't know chat attacked by trolls

1095.549 --> 1102.4189999999999
again or whatever and yeah that's real

1100.23 --> 1105.269
that's all out there and that is really

1102.419 --> 1107.659
valuable to me that's much worth much

1105.269 --> 1114.8700000000001
more that that's their real support and

1107.659 --> 1118.5
I also appreciate that you guys are

1114.87 --> 1122.85
defending me in a correct way and are

1118.5 --> 1126.24
not acting like like cult followers like

1122.85 --> 1129.149
is like I'm some kind of savant a secret

1126.24 --> 1131.909
King you know I'm not you guys aren't

1129.149 --> 1133.9189999999999
acting like Eric Dubay followers if you

1131.909 --> 1135.72
know what I mean I'm very happy about

1133.919 --> 1138.5700000000002
that now of course I did my best

1135.72 --> 1141.33
they basically tell ya like please don't

1138.57 --> 1144.57
just just it's all about the behavior

1141.33 --> 1147.149
it's all about doing it right and you

1144.57 --> 1152.37
guys have done that and I'm very proud

1147.149 --> 1155.61
of all of you for that and you should be

1152.37 --> 1160.2589999999998
proud of yourself and I'm just happy

1155.61 --> 1162.539
about it so yeah it's good it's okay

1160.259 --> 1163.409
even though my stream yesterday only had

1162.539 --> 1165.509
two up folks

1163.409 --> 1168.99
despite this confirmed that three people

1165.509 --> 1173.25
have uploaded it's alright it's alright

1168.99 --> 1176.75
really in the end it's just a sign that

1173.25 --> 1176.75
they don't really like me

1177.21 --> 1186.8500000000001
then again you know how does it really

1181.48 --> 1189.3600000000001
work how do channels get strikes how

1186.85 --> 1194.31
does it really work

1189.36 --> 1198.58
because I guess that I do sometimes

1194.31 --> 1201.01
push push it a little like I do bring in

1198.58 --> 1204.04
conspiracy things that YouTube

1201.01 --> 1206.62
definitely cracks down upon you know

1204.04 --> 1209.3799999999999
they definitely do that and other

1206.62 --> 1213.9399999999998
channels get well they certainly get

1209.38 --> 1216.16
like an assault striked and i don't seem

1213.94 --> 1218.95
to get that now I'm not trying to ask

1216.16 --> 1219.7
for that I don't want that why would I

1218.95 --> 1228.5800000000002
want that

1219.7 --> 1230.98
but for some reason the choking is the

1228.58 --> 1234.1599999999999
only tactic that's being applied I'm not

1230.98 --> 1236.56
getting striked and all that and I'm

1234.16 --> 1237.73
kind of happy about that but it is all

1236.56 --> 1242.44
is a bit odd

1237.73 --> 1245.29
I do feel like okay why do I get that

1242.44 --> 1248.77
approach and those other people they do

1245.29 --> 1252.97
get strike denied I wonder how that

1248.77 --> 1256.83
works why they choose those policies for

1252.97 --> 1256.83
you to word the approach

1262.86 --> 1267.8899999999999
no I have no idea who that is and who

1265.559 --> 1267.8899999999999
are you

1273.41 --> 1279.1100000000001
electric met see come okay

1295.26 --> 1308.21
[Music]

1298.61 --> 1310.2199999999998
yeah oh right well yeah tiny womble says

1308.21 --> 1312.5900000000001
let's not confirm those three people

1310.22 --> 1315.5
need to go back to the video that that

1312.59 --> 1317.4499999999998
is correct but hey if they literally

1315.5 --> 1321.559
remember uploading it because I don't

1317.45 --> 1322.28
know they do it a lot why is it being

1321.559 --> 1324.5
undone

1322.28 --> 1327.5
it's like really you have to go back to

1324.5 --> 1330.83
check if it's still there how is that

1327.5 --> 1337.25
normal people that's ridiculous

1330.83 --> 1340.07
what kind of voting system is like tells

1337.25 --> 1341.809
you oh yeah UFO did but then after it's

1340.07 --> 1345.559
like yeah Everett we're taking it away

1341.809 --> 1348.47
again that how does that make any damn

1345.559 --> 1354.1
sense it's so rigged if it works like

1348.47 --> 1354.1000000000001
that it's ridiculous it's ridiculous oh

1357.79 --> 1366.34
now you're looking at it says three oh

1361.299 --> 1366.34
yeah sure

1376.55 --> 1384.97
ah okay I'm getting a notification for

1381.11 --> 1388.51
Nathan going live in 30 minutes okay

1384.97 --> 1388.51
that's a good sign

1404.67 --> 1408.69
so anybody else wanna go back to the

1407.51 --> 1412.91
Flat Earth

1408.69 --> 1419.5800000000002
early-bird number 495 and upvoted I

1412.91 --> 1422.1000000000001
don't know just you know since I talked

1419.58 --> 1426.33
about it would be a good sign that we

1422.1 --> 1427.86
let YouTube know that we know and like

1426.33 --> 1432.48
even though they're gonna throw these

1427.86 --> 1436.08
obstacles that that's not yeah that's

1432.48 --> 1441.42
not gonna work I don't know that's that

1436.08 --> 1443.6399999999999
would be the best response I think so

1441.42 --> 1445.74
I guess I'll put the link of yesterday's

1443.64 --> 1449.8200000000002
show in the chat if you'd go there and

1445.74 --> 1453.06
you were there please go there again for

1449.82 --> 1460.56
a sec and up fold it let's just see if

1453.06 --> 1463.35

yesterday please check the link and

1487.29 --> 1495.6
check if it is still true and let's see

1490.47 --> 1498.24
if it is possible to yeah force it above

1495.6 --> 1500.85
that line or if this is just a thing

1498.24 --> 1505.74
that literally makes it impossible to go

1500.85 --> 1509.31
above a certain level your foot was

1505.74 --> 1511.55
still there so thank ok Amanda you how

1509.31 --> 1511.55

1520.45 --> 1524.05
from yesterday's show

1532.58 --> 1541.4289999999999
I'd look tiny bumble I'm trying to make

1538.039 --> 1543.95
a point here I know I just gave a speech

1541.429 --> 1546.739
as to five minutes long as to why it

1543.95 --> 1551.769
doesn't really matter but I want to push

1546.739 --> 1551.769
it just just to give it a little silent

1555.429 --> 1564.5590000000002
what is there any kind of objection to

1558.95 --> 1568.07
you people to do it said such a did you

1564.559 --> 1572.979
really not like yesterday's show oh yeah

1568.07 --> 1572.979
it says five now okay it's getting there

1580.16 --> 1585.7
you uploaded but nothing happened really

1586.39 --> 1595.7900000000002
yeah it when you do it uh refresh the

1590.63 --> 1598.7900000000002
page see if it's still there you know

1595.79 --> 1601.97
and hey if you think this is like real

1598.79 --> 1605.42
is if this is getting weird then I don't

1601.97 --> 1608.18
know maybe film it maybe you could film

1605.42 --> 1611.6000000000001
as you're doing it like with your mobile

1608.18 --> 1614.66
or something that your monitor and then

1611.6 --> 1617.6599999999999
refresh this yeah refresh the page and

1614.66 --> 1620.21
show that it's gone again maybe that's

1617.66 --> 1622.6100000000001
that could be like evident considered

1620.21 --> 1624.83
evidence like yeah YouTube is literally

1622.61 --> 1627.08
screwing with the votes of this guy I

1624.83 --> 1631.06
know make a little video about it

1627.08 --> 1631.06
I wouldn't mind give you full permission

1631.81 --> 1648.44
to use my channel as an example for that

1636.83 --> 1650.5
if you bump into that see where it's at

1648.44 --> 1650.5
now

1650.96 --> 1658.0900000000001
still at five oh there's more downloads

1655.47 --> 1667.21
[Laughter]

1658.09 --> 1667.2099999999998
out there anyway

1684.539 --> 1691.019
right Jose yes I know yeah you basically

1687.239 --> 1693.659
do the the Devi 504 style although he's

1691.019 --> 1696.539
pre-recorded your life and you say like

1693.659 --> 1700.949
no you gotta up vote first or we do will

1696.539 --> 1704.219
not proceed I don't know I guess I guess

1700.949 --> 1706.44
that'd work it can work like that for me

1704.219 --> 1708.8690000000001
there's no real point to that you know

1706.44 --> 1710.789
unless I have something specific to

1708.869 --> 1714.1789999999999
accomplish but just for my daily show

1710.789 --> 1717.959
net it's mostly just me talking anyway

1714.179 --> 1719.999
oh yeah

1717.959 --> 1721.829
Tom Parker that's right tomorrow we got

1719.999 --> 1725.099
a show yeah

1721.829 --> 1734.369
got a make sure that I put my alarm

1725.099 --> 1737.269
clock on early forget because it

1734.369 --> 1737.269
probably will

1761.08 --> 1764.26
[Music]

1766.08 --> 1772.35
okay well that's really nice tickets in

1769.44 --> 1774.42
Yosh alright so let's do a little test

1772.35 --> 1780.03
here now that we're into this kind of

1774.42 --> 1783.18
thing right let's show the haters and

1780.03 --> 1784.8
I'm mostly going to count people I know

1783.18 --> 1787.41
that have wrenches that are in there so

1784.8 --> 1791.52
if you like my show I don't know in

1787.41 --> 1795.3000000000002
general or you like most of it press 1

1791.52 --> 1798.75
if you tend to really not like it and

1795.3 --> 1800.97
you'd rather show your disdain for it in

1798.75 --> 1804.21
general you're one of those then press 0

1800.97 --> 1808.32
and if there's going to be sock spamming

1804.21 --> 1811.8600000000001
zeros I will just banned them because it

1808.32 --> 1819.12
has to be people that I know really are

1811.86 --> 1823.28
people that come back all right

1819.12 --> 1828.32
that Thank You Jose I appreciate that

1823.28 --> 1835.98
see so okay that's already six seven

1828.32 --> 1839.1899999999998
eight nine right that's already nine so

1835.98 --> 1840.93
that's four more than the yeah

1839.19 --> 1849.03
then the amounts have Rogen's up from

1840.93 --> 1852.179
yesterday now stagnancy as no no no I'm

1849.03 --> 1860.1299999999999
talking about suck accounts look if if I

1852.179 --> 1863.9
don't know if for example tiny Womble

1860.13 --> 1865.89
you know he's a baller I think he's okay

1863.9 --> 1869.24
he could say zero

1865.89 --> 1871.98
I would not ban him for it no I'm

1869.24 --> 1873.809
specifically talking about if troll Sox

1871.98 --> 1875.67
break out and start spamming zeros

1873.809 --> 1879.6
that's the only thing I was talking abut

1875.67 --> 1881.64
not just look you can you it's okay you

1879.6 --> 1885.33
know I don't it doesn't in the end

1881.64 --> 1887.3700000000001
matter to me if you don't like me what's

1885.33 --> 1891.78
more important concerning the chat is

1887.37 --> 1896.6699999999998
your behavior because the liking

1891.78 --> 1900.57
disliking that changes it can change but

1896.67 --> 1903.3600000000001
if the behavior doesn't change then it's

1900.57 --> 1906.99
gonna be disruptive and that's why I ban

1903.36 --> 1909.33
people or if I'm like really triggered

1906.99 --> 1912.24
for some personal reason but when that

1909.33 --> 1914.6999999999998
happens then afterwards I I tend to

1912.24 --> 1919.559
unblock them okay those bands are not

1914.7 --> 1924.059
permanent it's just that yeah when very

1919.559 --> 1926.76
typical baller chat trolls that are even

1924.059 --> 1928.95
like sort of real people they do keep

1926.76 --> 1930.69
using the same names and all that when

1928.95 --> 1932.46
they get in here and get all gamma over

1930.69 --> 1934.89
meaning just starting cell phone yeah

1932.46 --> 1936.1200000000001
attacking and all that nonsense yeah of

1934.89 --> 1937.41
course I'm gonna ban them because

1936.12 --> 1940.9199999999998
they're not there to have a conversation

1937.41 --> 1943.0800000000002
they're just there to troll it's not

1940.92 --> 1944.46
because they have another opinion it's

1943.08 --> 1945.57
because of the way they conduct

1944.46 --> 1948.98
themselves

1945.57 --> 1952.06
I find that disruptive it also

1948.98 --> 1955.54
influences other in the chat that Bell

1952.06 --> 1958.6
get well distracted by it get caught up

1955.54 --> 1961.06
in nonsense fighting it's very hard to

1958.6 --> 1963.48
resist sometimes you know so yeah that's

1961.06 --> 1963.48
the reason

1979.54 --> 1987.1299999999999
right well just don't get all triggered

1982.96 --> 1990.43
when somebody that has a show says I'm

1987.13 --> 1995.3100000000002
gonna ban you if you do this just listen

1990.43 --> 1995.3100000000002
more carefully as to what what it means

1995.52 --> 2001.29
because I was specifically pointing at

1998.11 --> 2003.81
trolls and trolls is not a general

2001.29 --> 2007.71
designation I give to people that have

2003.81 --> 2011.28
different opinions of me and there are

2007.71 --> 2016.92
several ballers in my jet to testify to

2011.28 --> 2020.31
that as proof so you should not over

2016.92 --> 2031.01
generalize the use of my words in that

2020.31 --> 2035.58
regard a sock account is when somebody

2031.01 --> 2039.27
uses a YouTube account that they don't

2035.58 --> 2041.55
normally do things with on the social

2039.27 --> 2044.07
media side of YouTube and all that they

2041.55 --> 2047.1599999999999
don't make videos on it they just make

2044.07 --> 2048.929
it because they expect to be banned

2047.16 --> 2051.09
that's usually what Sauk accounts are

2048.929 --> 2053.07
it's like some people are really good at

2051.09 --> 2055.98
quickly making more concert they have

2053.07 --> 2057.7200000000003
all these piles of backup accounts that

2055.98 --> 2064.169
they use to troll people with it they're

2057.72 --> 2068.8199999999997
generally called Sauk accounts they are

2064.169 --> 2071.399
usually used for trolling and they

2068.82 --> 2073.6490000000003
rarely have content or subscribers

2071.399 --> 2079.95
that's what makes it a Kazakh con

2073.649 --> 2083.3399999999997
I know I know Aries 106 I like it -

2079.95 --> 2086.6389999999997
sometimes when baller trolls come in but

2083.34 --> 2088.94
they yeah just because I like it doesn't

2086.639 --> 2093.29
mean that I won't end up banning them

2088.94 --> 2095.81
you know they go too far

2093.29 --> 2098.98
it's just how it works

2095.81 --> 2098.98
[Music]

2100.049 --> 2105.869
but you know there's plenty of bother

2103.299 --> 2109.499
people that don't really get banned

2105.869 --> 2111.9990000000003
unless they just get really discussing

2109.499 --> 2114.339
you know there's plenty of relatively

2111.999 --> 2119.41
prominent baller that can get in here

2114.339 --> 2121.66
that are not then and sometimes I do

2119.41 --> 2127.089
been and then I kind of forget if they

2121.66 --> 2129.7889999999998
would ask you know will you unban me

2127.089 --> 2131.769
then I'll say yeah that sure sure I'll

2129.789 --> 2134.7990000000004
find it's a hassle to find it you know

2131.769 --> 2136.359
all the the enjoined list because if

2134.799 --> 2139.41
it's full with so many trolls

2136.359 --> 2143.3489999999997
it's a giant list is it really is giant

2139.41 --> 2146.049
but I will get a person out as long as

2143.349 --> 2150.5190000000002
they kind of promise to behave well and

2146.049 --> 2154.15
not get trollee and so Vanya again or

2150.519 --> 2156.3689999999997
super disruptive I know people like

2154.15 --> 2159.94
Simon Dan he's been in my chat plenty of

2156.369 --> 2161.799
times and sometimes she's like I don't

2159.94 --> 2163.9
know he's gonna come he's still very

2161.799 --> 2166.21
much a baller he is still but it's more

2163.9 --> 2169.4790000000003
passive aggressive type of ball to reach

2166.21 --> 2171.969
then and it's fine but sometimes he gets

2169.479 --> 2174.1299999999997
all spammy and then he has a buddy with

2171.969 --> 2177.849
him or something and then they really

2174.13 --> 2181.809
like spam and put out I don't know soft

2177.849 --> 2184.3900000000003
slander nonsense and that's yeah that is

2181.809 --> 2186.2490000000003
kind of trolling and then I don't know

2184.39 --> 2189.249
if he goes too far I will end up banning

2186.249 --> 2192.069
him but in general I don't just ban him

2189.249 --> 2193.2099999999996
because he is like a baller or something

2192.069 --> 2199.799
no I don't do that

2193.21 --> 2203.469
I only then based on behavior in my chat

2199.799 --> 2208.21
and by how much

2203.469 --> 2209.559
a person has to offer intellectually if

2208.21 --> 2211.299
they have information of they have

2209.559 --> 2214.6600000000003
something to share something that makes

2211.299 --> 2218.71
it worthwhile them having me or having

2214.66 --> 2222.19
them in my chat see because somebody can

2218.71 --> 2225.91
be a little troll ish if they actually

2222.19 --> 2229.14
have of their value to offset it with

2225.91 --> 2232.0
you know it's called having a character

2229.14 --> 2234.73
people with a lot of value often have

2232.0 --> 2236.8
like character traits that people then

2234.73 --> 2239.38
tolerate because it's they're just too

2236.8 --> 2244.3300000000004
valuable to have around and I'm like

2239.38 --> 2246.4300000000003
that too but yeah you can't just assume

2244.33 --> 2253.12
that value you have to bring it to the

2246.43 --> 2260.5
table so that's how it works for me

2253.12 --> 2264.7
anyway Illuminati yeah shroom annatee is

2260.5 --> 2268.71
a perfect example of those he is pretty

2264.7 --> 2277.75
much a troll but he has yes he doesn't

2268.71 --> 2281.56
have comedic qualities and he rarely

2277.75 --> 2284.44
goes super too far so that makes it okay

2281.56 --> 2286.81
to have him around although he can be a

2284.44 --> 2289.3
bit spammy sometimes but that's it's not

2286.81 --> 2293.41
always so it's just fine having him

2289.3 --> 2297.25
around yeah he is a fool but at least

2293.41 --> 2302.7999999999997
he's not so disruptive a fool right

2297.25 --> 2305.79
hello Shawn Smith thanks for stopping by

really should say you guys have been

2395.52 --> 2405.36
pretty generous to me and I I feel

2399.57 --> 2410.03
really lucky because I guess because of

2405.36 --> 2414.05
all the support recently I haven't had a

2410.03 --> 2416.8500000000004
like a real financial despair moment

2414.05 --> 2420.2400000000002
anymore for at least two months

2416.85 --> 2424.85
like none and it's been great for my

2420.24 --> 2427.97
sister it's I feel much more confident I

2424.85 --> 2431.2799999999997
don't know sometimes I do get a bit

2427.97 --> 2433.37
jumbly during the show because they're

2431.28 --> 2435.57
still like yeah I still have the weird

2433.37 --> 2438.45
spiritual issues you know that I deal

2435.57 --> 2441.27
with and like the struggle with the

2438.45 --> 2445.14
entire world it seems sometimes inside

2441.27 --> 2447.39
but yeah financially there's not been no

2445.14 --> 2451.19
more panic really because of all of your

2447.39 --> 2454.29
support thank you so much you're really

2451.19 --> 2457.11
it feels like you guys are holding me up

2454.29 --> 2460.58
on your hands I really appreciate that

2457.11 --> 2460.58
thank you so much

2468.82 --> 2471.54
yes

2477.62 --> 2487.6
right stick its in ash because in a way

2481.01 --> 2496.7000000000003
it is there's just no way it's bad

2487.6 --> 2499.49
anyway it's like it's it's just the the

2496.7 --> 2502.43
way the contract works I guess this is

2499.49 --> 2505.16
concerning money you know money money is

2502.43 --> 2508.19
very complex how it works oh by the way

2505.16 --> 2509.8999999999996
thank you rocky alive for the for $99

2508.19 --> 2512.27
super chat donation to help in this

2509.9 --> 2514.01
trying time for truth creative works in

2512.27 --> 2516.85
many ways yes he does

2514.01 --> 2516.8500000000004
thank you so much

2531.72 --> 2544.1899999999996
come off mood right but the yeah the

2537.39 --> 2548.04
charity of strangers it is it's like an

2544.19 --> 2550.29
an unconditional contract like that

2548.04 --> 2553.68
because if you have a job you have a

2550.29 --> 2559.44
career and bank loans and all that that

2553.68 --> 2563.69
is all conditional it's all when you got

2559.44 --> 2568.53
the money they kind of got your energy

2563.69 --> 2571.53
and after that you have been you have to

2568.53 --> 2574.32
give them or they'll take it away again

2571.53 --> 2575.6400000000003
see that's the difference when you get

2574.32 --> 2578.1600000000003
money by strangers

2575.64 --> 2581.3399999999997
there's no threat that they're gonna

2578.16 --> 2584.19
take it away again it's just that no if

2581.34 --> 2586.23
you just you can keep going that's what

2584.19 --> 2588.59
it means you can keep going there's no

2586.23 --> 2593.76
guarantee for the future but at least

2588.59 --> 2596.94
there's no threat because you got it see

2593.76 --> 2598.8300000000004
that that's I don't know maybe this

2596.94 --> 2601.76
sounds very strange to a lot of people

2598.83 --> 2608.0699999999997
and that is kind of like how it is to me

2601.76 --> 2611.3100000000004
money's always felt dangerous to me it's

2608.07 --> 2615.75
like if you suddenly got a huge pile of

2611.31 --> 2617.94
money and I'm talking huge huge now by

2615.75 --> 2620.15
passing things like inheritance money

2617.94 --> 2622.29
you know because you just get it

2620.15 --> 2625.14
although you still have to deal with it

2622.29 --> 2629.4
every time you get a huge pile of money

2625.14 --> 2636.89
for some reason by a contract or a job

2629.4 --> 2641.94
offer it's well technically you're

2636.89 --> 2644.52
contracted even though at first you

2641.94 --> 2647.94
think you might not be contracted you

2644.52 --> 2650.04
are because nobody gets a huge pile of

2647.94 --> 2653.4
money for no reason at all there's

2650.04 --> 2658.13
always something to it that's gonna work

2653.4 --> 2661.25
into that money see if it's a huge pile

2658.13 --> 2662.3900000000003
so that's why huge amounts of money you

2661.25 --> 2665.089
know when it was a little kid it was

2662.39 --> 2667.3089999999997
like oh yeah the lottery Oh millions all

2665.089 --> 2669.98
never work again but that's such a

2667.309 --> 2671.779
superficial idea really because when you

2669.98 --> 2674.69
start to figure out more what money

2671.779 --> 2677.72
really is and how things work out there

2674.69 --> 2683.119
then you realize that money even if you

2677.72 --> 2686.569
just get it it's rarely for free and you

2683.119 --> 2690.0190000000002
can even legally point at that because

2686.569 --> 2692.21
it's based on that it's even technically

2690.019 --> 2695.269
based on that but even the spiritual

2692.21 --> 2701.63
side of it it's just money is never

2695.269 --> 2706.3999999999996
really for free oh by the way thank you

2701.63 --> 2709.25
sticker Jignesh I hope I'm saying your

2706.4 --> 2711.9500000000003
name correctly for the five Australian

2709.25 --> 2713.109
dollar super chat donation thank you

2711.95 --> 2715.97
very much

2713.109 --> 2718.46
5oc dollars for you made for someone

2715.97 --> 2720.5589999999997
with enough to share I'm glad you have

2718.46 --> 2724.069
enough you know I can't emphasize that

2720.559 --> 2727.4900000000002
enough do not feel guilty if you're

2724.069 --> 2730.759
doing well if you have money I used to

2727.49 --> 2733.0989999999997
feel bad when I had a lot of money

2730.759 --> 2736.22
because there were so many people that

2733.099 --> 2740.7200000000003
didn't around me it was like almost like

2736.22 --> 2743.0
a Kurt I felt so guilty at times but I

2740.72 --> 2746.2099999999996
had to like force that away it just

2743.0 --> 2749.299
wasn't good like that but try not to

2746.21 --> 2753.68
feel guilty try not to feel guilty for

2749.299 --> 2759.849
for having for doing good don't feel

2753.68 --> 2763.519
forced to give it away just instead

2759.849 --> 2767.839
ignore that and just look and then and

2763.519 --> 2772.609
then do it because you wanna you or you

2767.839 --> 2775.069
think it'll do good try to ignore the

2772.609 --> 2776.45
guilt part if you got it I don't know I

2775.069 --> 2779.299
used to have it I don't know if people

2776.45 --> 2781.6699999999996
that are giving that have it don't feel

2779.299 --> 2783.5
guilty you know I sometimes it can't

2781.67 --> 2786.549
help it when I feel really almost

2783.5 --> 2788.649
panicky about my situation I may almost

2786.549 --> 2792.679
like

2788.649 --> 2795.529
talk a little guilt I try not to it's

2792.679 --> 2797.869
really desperation when I do that I try

2795.529 --> 2799.579
not to because I don't want people to

2797.869 --> 2801.23
feel guilty it's not a good motivation

2799.579 --> 2804.389
to do things

2801.23 --> 2804.389
[Music]

2810.53 --> 2823.55
oh dear that's not a good sign at the

2817.67 --> 2831.14
close out of your company roof well what

2823.55 --> 2832.82
kind of company was that that all right

2831.14 --> 2835.52
getting sick I'll see you around

2832.82 --> 2837.6400000000003
thanks for possibly coming by watching

2835.52 --> 2839.99
the show don't forget to Rogen's it up

2837.64 --> 2842.859
I'm gonna run out in four in five

2839.99 --> 2842.859
minutes by the way

2843.31 --> 2846.31
right

2847.75 --> 2853.13
yes Rukiya life money isn't evil the

2850.79 --> 2854.96
love of money is the problem is when you

2853.13 --> 2857.6600000000003
have a lot of money even if you don't

2854.96 --> 2860.03
love it there's gonna be money lovers

2857.66 --> 2860.5989999999997
that are gonna start circling you like

2860.03 --> 2863.9300000000003
vultures

2860.599 --> 2867.59
I literally experienced this I didn't

2863.93 --> 2870.14
have it that bad because I didn't have

2867.59 --> 2872.56
that much money but it still happened

2870.14 --> 2875.5699999999997
they smell it they start to smell it

2872.56 --> 2877.88
it's creepy I thought it was creepy I

2875.57 --> 2880.7000000000003
didn't like it I did literally when I

2877.88 --> 2883.19
had the time the peak of my money I just

2880.7 --> 2886.79
wanted people to leave me alone about

2883.19 --> 2890.51
that I wanted to just kind of almost be

2886.79 --> 2894.02
anonymous and just try to find my way

2890.51 --> 2899.51
and get to know people and the money was

2894.02 --> 2901.25
always in the way that's why eventually

2899.51 --> 2903.65
I just stopped bringing it up entirely

2901.25 --> 2905.72
because I started out like oh yeah I'm

2903.65 --> 2908.359
gonna I'm gonna bring I have money it's

2905.72 --> 2912.0499999999997
just like the typical teenage response

2908.359 --> 2913.64
you know it's like I guess everybody may

2912.05 --> 2915.4700000000003
have that at some point in their life

2913.64 --> 2917.7799999999997
when they're suddenly score big time

2915.47 --> 2922.0699999999997
one way it like it I hope in a in a

2917.78 --> 2924.23
legal way score big time and yeah what

2922.07 --> 2926.3300000000004
do you are gonna be you're gonna have

2924.23 --> 2928.839
that SLUSA fair institution to be like

2926.33 --> 2931.31
oh yeah look at the money it's like

2928.839 --> 2937.0099999999998
everybody probably had that at least

2931.31 --> 2938.91
once in their life or maybe I'm just

2937.01 --> 2942.059
saying that because I had it

2938.91 --> 2946.8799999999997
I don't know if this is absolutely true

2942.059 --> 2954.119
I wonder but it does seem logical to me

2946.88 --> 2956.609
I don't know if any of you could could

2954.119 --> 2961.67
confirm or deny that that would be great

2956.609 --> 2961.67
and then I'm gonna round out the show

2969.65 --> 2982.339
sticking cigarette company creates signs

2972.289 --> 2984.26
okay a sign company hmm yeah well I I

2982.339 --> 2989.029
hope you don't I hope you're very

2984.26 --> 2990.8900000000003
careful with your money you know you

2989.029 --> 2994.809
don't know exactly how long it's gonna

2990.89 --> 2998.0589999999997
last because I don't know

2994.809 --> 2999.9100000000003
other issues may hit as well you know if

2998.059 --> 3002.1090000000004
you're just sitting on a pile of money

2999.91 --> 3004.1189999999997
you don't know exactly what's gonna

3002.109 --> 3009.359
happen what if suddenly inflation hits

3004.119 --> 3009.359
it I think it'd probably be best to just

3010.65 --> 3019.0
stuck at the moment right anyway look if

3016.45 --> 3020.859
you got a company you know fully running

3019.0 --> 3023.41
you probably know what you're doing and

3020.859 --> 3028.27
there's plenty of people around to give

3023.41 --> 3030.22
at least sensible level advice so yeah

3028.27 --> 3032.829
once it is over the economy is gonna

3030.22 --> 3035.23
explode [ __ ] you yes it will because

3032.829 --> 3039.039
everybody's gonna be arrested and eager

3035.23 --> 3041.7400000000002
and like I'm bored I want a freakin work

3039.039 --> 3046.529
can you imagine all the workaholics

3041.74 --> 3054.5789999999997
right now that are just stuck like ah

3046.529 --> 3057.88
what am I gonna do yeah they're gonna

3054.579 --> 3059.9500000000003
like go nuts and what probably in this

3057.88 --> 3063.4900000000002
time they're already figuring out new

3059.95 --> 3066.3689999999997
business plans that they're planning for

3063.49 --> 3066.9399999999996
and like waiting like when are we ready

3066.369 --> 3068.9500000000003
to go

3066.94 --> 3071.349
when are we ready to go and then it's

3068.95 --> 3074.8799999999997
like yeah the Coronas crisis is over

3071.349 --> 3079.51
boom jobs shipped up to JJ job says it's

3074.88 --> 3082.359
yeah I might actually I don't know

3079.51 --> 3083.7400000000002
what's gonna happen exactly if if it's

3082.359 --> 3084.279
gonna happen like that that will be

3083.74 --> 3089.74
great

3084.279 --> 3092.5
it all depends on if it's gonna stay - a

3089.74 --> 3094.299

them rent anymore I wish my tenant would

3141.08 --> 3145.4
not charge me rent anymore

3142.85 --> 3149.38
during the corona crisis my god that

3145.4 --> 3155.69
would give me a financial explosion

3149.38 --> 3158.6600000000003

3158.66 --> 3162.98
bail out or something I don't know man

3161.06 --> 3164.84

3162.98 --> 3167.48
already like a financial compensation

3164.84 --> 3169.8500000000004
how is that gonna work well it's not

3167.48 --> 3172.1
gonna be divided equally I promise you

that no matter the country are any

3172.1 --> 3177.19
bailouts concerning the corona situation

3174.56 --> 3185.15
it's not going to be divided equally

3177.19 --> 3188.0
trust me so but yeah some groups some

3185.15 --> 3193.34
businesses you know some professions may

3188.0 --> 3197.48
