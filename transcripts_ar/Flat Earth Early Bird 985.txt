91.92 --> 94.159
so

95.119 --> 99.92
yeah the weather today is

98.079 --> 102.24
very similar to yesterday although i

99.92 --> 104.479
think it's a little bit warmer than it

102.24 --> 107.759
was yesterday but

104.479 --> 107.759
i checked the temperature

108.88 --> 113.67999999999999
after this

111.2 --> 116.479
yeah it's been raining it's been cloudy

113.68 --> 116.47900000000001
it's been windy

120.399 --> 124.479
right

122.479 --> 128.2
it's gonna be tough to find a blue spot

124.479 --> 128.2
in between all this

130.16 --> 132.56
oh well

138.72 --> 143.84
hello

141.04 --> 146.16
return to normal first in chat good to

143.84 --> 146.16
see you

147.68 --> 153.8
it is wednesday the 18th of august 2021

157.84 --> 160.08
uh

161.519 --> 164.56
right okay it's

164.879 --> 168.879
18 degrees

166.879 --> 171.04
it's only one degree more than yesterday

168.879 --> 173.04
but

171.04 --> 175.28
it does feel like it's a little bit

173.04 --> 176.239
warmer

175.28 --> 179.68
right

176.239 --> 181.36
but then again yesterday i had the weird

179.68 --> 183.44
effects

181.36 --> 187.12
the shock effects

183.44 --> 187.12
that might have influenced it as well

187.519 --> 193.20000000000002
right

188.959 --> 193.2
so yesterday's show was a bit weird

196.0 --> 201.44
first half at least second half was

198.64 --> 201.44
actually pretty good

201.68 --> 206.64000000000001
i didn't watch it back though

203.68 --> 208.799
it's just too busy

206.64 --> 213.79899999999998
the flat earth debates

208.799 --> 213.799
also went on qe live this time

216.56 --> 221.0
although yeah

217.76 --> 222.64
getting on it is a bit an over

221.0 --> 225.12
exaggeration

222.64 --> 228.55999999999997
i was in the panel i did talk but i was

225.12 --> 228.56
actually at the same time

228.64 --> 233.35999999999999
watching mitchell from australia's

230.64 --> 236.55999999999997
stream which was live he was live

233.36 --> 239.519
streaming from the beach

236.56 --> 241.36
right at that same moment

239.519 --> 242.959
not too long after kiwi started to

241.36 --> 244.72000000000003
stream

242.959 --> 246.72
and that was actually really fun to be

244.72 --> 249.04
there in chat so i was kind of like

246.72 --> 250.72
doing multiple things at the same time

249.04 --> 254.79899999999998
it was awesome

250.72 --> 257.04
also interesting note

254.799 --> 261.359
uh

257.04 --> 264.16
made by jim bob got in the chat

261.359 --> 266.479
like in kiwi lives chat and even gave a

264.16 --> 269.04
super chat that really stood out to me

266.479 --> 272.71999999999997
because i know jim bob he's like a

269.04 --> 275.28000000000003
pretty close friend to owen benjamin

272.72 --> 277.6
even gets on with him on on own

275.28 --> 279.28
benjamin's streams at times and it's

277.6 --> 281.12
like a lot of fun the guy is like really

279.28 --> 283.03999999999996
good at voices and he really does that

281.12 --> 284.88
all the time and he has his own youtube

283.04 --> 286.16
channel

284.88 --> 289.199
and

286.16 --> 291.12
i didn't know he had a youtube channel

289.199 --> 294.32
i thought he was like banned everywhere

291.12 --> 294.32
too and he was just um

294.4 --> 298.4
unlike owen benjamin's platform but yeah

296.72 --> 299.36
apparently he does have a youtube

298.4 --> 302.15999999999997
channel

299.36 --> 304.47900000000004
and i did check it out and watch like an

302.16 --> 308.08000000000004
hour stream of his basically him sitting

304.479 --> 308.08
in front of the camera i think in a car

308.56 --> 312.4
maybe not i it was him on camera anyway

311.6 --> 314.08000000000004
and

312.4 --> 317.84
holy [ __ ] dude

314.08 --> 320.08
this is a guy that absolutely absolutely

317.84 --> 321.84
watches flat earth debate and quantum

320.08 --> 324.96
eraser

321.84 --> 327.52
because like he echoed so many

324.96 --> 330.56
ways of explanation like directly even

327.52 --> 332.88
used the joke in comparison to unicorn

330.56 --> 334.72
farts okay

332.88 --> 337.6
so

334.72 --> 340.16
talked about endlessly about

337.6 --> 343.52000000000004
about gravity how it's space-time

340.16 --> 346.16
bending etc etc like he was just fully

343.52 --> 347.12
informed and

346.16 --> 349.28000000000003
like

347.12 --> 353.08
yeah that's awesome

349.28 --> 353.08
so check him out

354.8 --> 358.319
like

355.919 --> 361.28
this is a guy that is really

358.319 --> 361.28000000000003
pretty interesting

364.56 --> 368.319
let me see i'll link him up

366.88 --> 371.52
have to find him

368.319 --> 371.52000000000004
in my list first

374.0 --> 377.0
huh

380.08 --> 382.56
where are you

385.12 --> 388.759
ah there you go

399.199 --> 404.479
all right so check them out

401.52 --> 407.96
hey mitchell from australia

404.479 --> 407.96
welcome to chat

409.28 --> 414.79999999999995
thanks for watching flatter school that

411.12 --> 414.8
was great i love it

419.44 --> 423.84
and yeah it was kind of fun because like

421.599 --> 426.71999999999997
even bob from globe busters eventually

423.84 --> 428.15999999999997
got in your chat

426.72 --> 431.199
and

428.16 --> 433.59900000000005
i think like the bob wars are finally

431.199 --> 435.68
over because he was just

433.599 --> 437.12
nice to me

435.68 --> 439.84000000000003
so

437.12 --> 443.199
maybe it all finally cool off

439.84 --> 445.19899999999996
we can just move on with our own things

443.199 --> 446.72
so yeah yesterday overall very

445.199 --> 450.8
interesting day

446.72 --> 453.759
out there on youtube land

450.8 --> 453.759
in my experience

455.039 --> 460.4
did you say there were some live yes yes

457.44 --> 462.56
mitchell from australia qe live

460.4 --> 465.35999999999996
kiwi has a live show

462.56 --> 467.759
on tuesday

465.36 --> 469.28000000000003
as well as saturday although he's he

467.759 --> 471.12
likes uh

469.28 --> 473.28
does one week

471.12 --> 475.28000000000003
he does a show and then next week on

473.28 --> 477.11999999999995
that day he doesn't

475.28 --> 479.11999999999995
but yeah you are streaming right in the

477.12 --> 482.24
middle of that live stream and i was on

479.12 --> 485.039
his panel literally

482.24 --> 487.039
like at some point and i had to have

485.039 --> 489.28
both volumes open and then i would be

487.039 --> 491.36
like literally chatting in your chat

489.28 --> 493.44
back and forth as you literally address

491.36 --> 495.759
what i say and [ __ ] and then hearing

493.44 --> 498.71999999999997
like irwin and like oh [ __ ]

495.759 --> 500.8
back unmute on discord mute the youtube

498.72 --> 503.12
page and your channel like oh hi yes i'm

500.8 --> 503.12
here

503.28 --> 509.67999999999995
multitasking

505.36 --> 509.68
it's a bit of a hassle but it's very fun

509.759 --> 513.44
uh

510.96 --> 516.3199999999999
i sometimes do that like on saturdays

513.44 --> 518.24
with ball busters too when uh martin

516.32 --> 521.6400000000001
litke is doing his flatter day night

518.24 --> 521.64
live shows

521.68 --> 526.399
because yeah saturday night

524.56 --> 529.279
there are a lot of like

526.399 --> 532.64
just and it's to be expected people plan

529.279 --> 536.72
in for this just great shows and they're

532.64 --> 538.64
typically going to run at the same time

536.72 --> 540.9590000000001
right and the solution to that is just

538.64 --> 543.12
watching multiple streams at the same

540.959 --> 545.76
time yeah i really feel like i'm like

543.12 --> 545.76
this weird

547.36 --> 551.6
operator sometimes

549.6 --> 552.5600000000001
i've actually had points where i would

551.6 --> 555.839
listen

552.56 --> 558.0
to three streams at the same time

555.839 --> 559.6
really

558.0 --> 560.88
it doesn't last very long by the way

559.6 --> 562.72
because eventually it just get

560.88 --> 564.88
overloaded but it does work because i

562.72 --> 567.12
could just it's just like sitting in a

564.88 --> 568.48
room where there's like a party and

567.12 --> 570.48
people around you are having

568.48 --> 572.16
conversations right they're not having

570.48 --> 573.76
the same conversation they're talking

572.16 --> 576.399
right through one another

573.76 --> 578.0
but i've just been trained being like

576.399 --> 580.88
the guy that

578.0 --> 584.0
is not very blabbery in the direct a

580.88 --> 585.12
company of other people i always just

584.0 --> 587.04
listen

585.12 --> 589.68
and then when things get interesting

587.04 --> 591.76
well i just follow three conversations

589.68 --> 594.959
at the same time

591.76 --> 594.959
i've been trained to do that

595.36 --> 600.72
i've done it in all kinds of forms like

598.24 --> 602.0790000000001
15 years ago i would listen to alex

600.72 --> 604.399
jones

602.079 --> 606.16
play a video game

604.399 --> 608.16
and

606.16 --> 610.3199999999999
my favorite music at the same time and

608.16 --> 612.64
all that like i don't know this is a

610.32 --> 612.6400000000001
thing

614.88 --> 618.72
probably not the only one that does that

616.48 --> 621.2
sort of thing anyway hey hello dank good

618.72 --> 625.0400000000001
to see you and tom parker too by the way

621.2 --> 625.0400000000001
terra 306 dutch sailor

630.56 --> 634.399
listening to three streams well

635.2 --> 640.6400000000001
to be fair when you do that you can't

637.68 --> 643.04
really enjoy all the streams

640.64 --> 644.88
all that much it's just to keep track of

643.04 --> 647.8389999999999
what's going on

644.88 --> 647.8389999999999
right

650.399 --> 653.6
and then when something catches your

651.92 --> 656.7199999999999
attention you can basically turn the

653.6 --> 658.8000000000001
rest off to focus on that one thing

656.72 --> 660.64
and as soon as that scene is over you

658.8 --> 664.56
unmute the others again and follow it

660.64 --> 664.56
all simultaneously i don't know it's

668.32 --> 671.519
it's not for everybody

673.6 --> 677.76
like it does take up concentration like

675.6 --> 679.9200000000001
it doesn't work if you're also for

677.76 --> 682.16
example gonna do the dishes at the same

679.92 --> 682.16
time

682.72 --> 687.44
that's a little bit much it does right

685.04 --> 690.079
really require like listening in like

687.44 --> 691.839
okay listen to three conversations at

690.079 --> 694.4799999999999
the same time you can't really also

691.839 --> 695.6800000000001
focus on doing something else

694.48 --> 698.9590000000001
right

695.68 --> 698.959
anyway hello tomonoid

700.959 --> 705.1199999999999
yeah i'm not going to juggle chainsaws

702.8 --> 705.12
thanks

715.04 --> 720.639
um return to know he still has some

717.519 --> 720.639
funny ideas ooh

721.839 --> 727.44
talking about jim bob

724.32 --> 731.72
i linked him up in chat

727.44 --> 731.72
level rob h good to see you

742.839 --> 747.36
right yeah he does have some funny ideas

745.76 --> 749.6
like

747.36 --> 751.92
he is really trying to work through it

749.6 --> 753.6
all on his own level

751.92 --> 756.8389999999999
like jim bob

753.6 --> 760.399
is not just cool he is really freaking

756.839 --> 762.1600000000001
smart he's like

760.399 --> 764.32
it's hard to explain he has that level

762.16 --> 766.48
of intelligence where you really are

764.32 --> 768.5600000000001
like forced to do everything in your own

766.48 --> 770.639
way at your own pace

768.56 --> 772.4799999999999
because otherwise you go mad

770.639 --> 774.48
i know all about that

772.48 --> 776.48
and i definitely recognize it in others

774.48 --> 778.88
when they have that and he's a very

776.48 --> 782.5600000000001
talented guy not just intellectually but

778.88 --> 783.519
also he is a great mimicker

782.56 --> 785.5999999999999
like

783.519 --> 786.88
he has that

785.6 --> 789.519
thing

786.88 --> 791.92
and i have it too in my own way

789.519 --> 795.2
i do voices too and some of them i do

791.92 --> 797.4399999999999
very well others not so well but

795.2 --> 797.44
yeah

798.8 --> 803.92
i really love this ben shapiro it's so

801.2 --> 807.519
freaking funny he really likes to do uh

803.92 --> 810.639
what's the other guy's name um

807.519 --> 810.639
i always forget him

810.88 --> 814.68
the squeaky man

817.68 --> 822.2399999999999
but like his bench appear is like super

820.32 --> 823.279
super on target

822.24 --> 826.48
like

823.279 --> 828.56
if you'd literally have without visuals

826.48 --> 830.639
ben shapiro the actual band shapiro and

828.56 --> 832.959
him

830.639 --> 834.8
with a similar sound set up then you

832.959 --> 837.199
might have trouble at first trying to

834.8 --> 838.959
distinguish who is who until jim bob

837.199 --> 841.04
just makes it a little extra silly and

838.959 --> 843.3599999999999
then you do recognize it

841.04 --> 847.36
oh yeah great obama well i think that

843.36 --> 847.36
owen benjamin does a better obama

849.04 --> 856.199
you've got to do us a voice now

852.079 --> 856.199
i'm sorry i'm not a

856.48 --> 862.24
a trained trick animal that doesn't work

859.839 --> 862.24
like that

863.68 --> 868.7199999999999
but yeah i do gollum i do a pretty damn

865.76 --> 870.56
good gollum for sure

868.72 --> 872.8000000000001
and a whole bunch of things i don't even

870.56 --> 874.56
really consciously know it's not like i

872.8 --> 876.399
have a list of repertoire that i'm

874.56 --> 878.4799999999999
really proud of

876.399 --> 881.279
it's just that i've always had that i've

878.48 --> 885.639
always done voices my entire life like

881.279 --> 885.639
from a very young age on

896.88 --> 899.8389999999999
right

902.88 --> 908.32
oh you did say obama right right

906.32 --> 909.519
uh ob

908.32 --> 912.0
it's

909.519 --> 914.48
home benjamin yeah yeah it is obama is

912.0 --> 914.48
amazing

917.6 --> 921.6800000000001
i don't know if they have ever done that

919.04 --> 923.8389999999999
but like they should probably figure out

921.68 --> 926.3199999999999
like a really good sketch

923.839 --> 928.24
where they could do

926.32 --> 930.72
oh jordan peterson right that's the

928.24 --> 933.199
character jordan peterson interviewing

930.72 --> 935.6800000000001
obama

933.199 --> 938.0
because maybe like in the real world he

935.68 --> 940.16
would maybe do that and yeah that could

938.0 --> 942.8
be a really interesting sketch if they

940.16 --> 942.8
combine that

951.44 --> 957.2790000000001
also because they could be really really

954.24 --> 959.759
smart in like the

957.279 --> 960.8
information backdrop part

959.759 --> 962.88
of both

960.8 --> 964.959
right both have like a like an

962.88 --> 966.8
information legacy that

964.959 --> 969.1199999999999
yeah both

966.8 --> 971.279
jim bob and noam benjamin are very well

969.12 --> 973.68
aware of so they could really make like

971.279 --> 976.88
an almost movie level worked out sketch

973.68 --> 978.4799999999999
together like that if they wanted to

976.88 --> 981.199
maybe they already have i don't know i

978.48 --> 983.839
have not really seen all of the streams

981.199 --> 983.8389999999999
every part

986.639 --> 990.399
glow busters

989.519 --> 991.839
what

990.399 --> 996.279
hello

991.839 --> 996.2790000000001
what about it return to normal

999.68 --> 1003.5999999999999
saying pop ball busters

1003.759 --> 1009.32
flop us

1006.32 --> 1009.32
right

1012.079 --> 1016.399
funny idea while he's just

1014.399 --> 1017.759
uh i don't want to like

1016.399 --> 1019.759
light that

1017.759 --> 1022.16
back on fire or anything but yeah he has

1019.759 --> 1024.799
some cookie ideas

1022.16 --> 1027.52
it's like very unwilling to to be a

1024.799 --> 1027.52
minimalist

1034.959 --> 1040.079
so it has a tendency to draw things

1037.6 --> 1043.36
outside of like the scientific field and

1040.079 --> 1044.72
get into very speculative grounds

1043.36 --> 1046.6399999999999
there's a whole bunch of people out

1044.72 --> 1049.64
there that do that right it's just

1046.64 --> 1049.64
dreamers

1058.799 --> 1062.559
obama ben shapiro injury

1063.52 --> 1066.96
oh damn

1064.72 --> 1068.08
they did do a sketch like that

1066.96 --> 1069.6000000000001
huh

1068.08 --> 1073.1999999999998
yeah now that you're saying it i

1069.6 --> 1075.36
remember i because uh was it

1073.2 --> 1077.76
mountain bear i think made a cartoon

1075.36 --> 1080.559
with that i remember now that's so funny

1077.76 --> 1082.799
so they already did that

1080.559 --> 1084.799
i forgot about it but yeah now did you

1082.799 --> 1086.96
mention it i do actually remember now

1084.799 --> 1089.96
having seen that video

1086.96 --> 1089.96
huh

1096.88 --> 1102.88
although yeah with ben shapiro versus

1099.12 --> 1102.8799999999999
obama doesn't really work though

1106.08 --> 1110.48
makes it to

1107.6 --> 1110.48
disconnected

1116.32 --> 1119.8799999999999
hey good servant

1125.28 --> 1130.08
but thanks for the for the paypal

1127.28 --> 1133.8799999999999
donation by the way again good servant

1130.08 --> 1133.8799999999999
i appreciate that

1142.08 --> 1145.24
all right

1148.99 --> 1152.339
[Music]

1156.32 --> 1160.799
hey let me see a couple of blue spots

1158.96 --> 1163.799
that's cool

1160.799 --> 1163.799
huh

1187.84 --> 1192.9189999999999
does jesus oppose cannabis no

1197.2 --> 1202.4
i mean you could interpret some things

1199.36 --> 1206.559
he said as that if you like categorize

1202.4 --> 1207.3600000000001
pharmaca into any substance

1206.559 --> 1210.24
right

1207.36 --> 1211.9189999999999
that is not just food

1210.24 --> 1214.799
but yeah that's

1211.919 --> 1214.7990000000002
disputable

1214.96 --> 1222.799
he never directly opposed the use of

1218.84 --> 1227.039
it by name or anything or by exact

1222.799 --> 1227.039
description so i don't think so

1229.039 --> 1235.08
the most high isn't the ah that's

1231.52 --> 1235.08
terrible joke

1243.6 --> 1247.28
hello by the way one footer unit

1247.44 --> 1253.2
you can absolutely eat a marijuana

1250.4 --> 1255.1200000000001
you probably could

1253.2 --> 1258.0
yeah

1255.12 --> 1260.3999999999999
or make a soup out of it

1258.0 --> 1262.799
like a good bullion

1260.4 --> 1264.96
with cannabis leaves

1262.799 --> 1266.6399999999999
or even like the buds

1264.96 --> 1268.72
yeah

1266.64 --> 1272.44
i think that would probably be actually

1268.72 --> 1272.44
pretty healthy actually

1277.6 --> 1281.4399999999998
ah

1278.64 --> 1283.5200000000002
indeed he did and

1281.44 --> 1285.039
most even more importantly don't be

1283.52 --> 1286.96
afraid

1285.039 --> 1290.52
like just don't be afraid how many times

1286.96 --> 1290.52
did he say it

1290.96 --> 1296.88
is it like a hundred times or something

1293.44 --> 1299.6000000000001
i don't know a lot of times

1296.88 --> 1301.7600000000002
owen benjamin actually counted it

1299.6 --> 1305.84
i don't remember the number but yeah he

1301.76 --> 1305.84
says don't be afraid a lot

1306.32 --> 1309.52
fear is sin

1310.4 --> 1316.0
i don't know about that

1312.64 --> 1318.0
but it does lead to sin

1316.0 --> 1320.0
if you act on it right fear is a

1318.0 --> 1322.48
sensation but if you act on that

1320.0 --> 1323.52
sensation or you fail to act because of

1322.48 --> 1327.1200000000001
it

1323.52 --> 1327.12
then that could be a sin

1330.48 --> 1335.3600000000001
right it's all about the actions

1333.039 --> 1337.44
sin is about the actions not about

1335.36 --> 1340.24
senses or sensation

1337.44 --> 1344.44
it's about the actions

1340.24 --> 1344.44
always remember that

1346.08 --> 1350.8799999999999
right well a lack of confidence can lead

1348.08 --> 1353.12
to a whole range of trouble

1350.88 --> 1353.1200000000001
so

1353.6 --> 1357.76
right you end up worshiping what you

1355.36 --> 1362.24
fear that's right but that's when you

1357.76 --> 1362.24
act on that fear and then make that fear

1362.4 --> 1365.919
like your

1364.0 --> 1368.64
your obsession

1365.919 --> 1370.88
and then that yeah that effectively

1368.64 --> 1372.7990000000002
makes you worship it that's right

1370.88 --> 1376.0800000000002
oh thank you by the way that flat fellow

1372.799 --> 1379.9189999999999
for the 99 cent super chat donation

1376.08 --> 1379.9189999999999
welcome to the early bird show

1383.2 --> 1388.8400000000001
empower your fear what

1385.28 --> 1388.84
i wouldn't do that

1389.84 --> 1393.6789999999999
just let it go

1392.4 --> 1396.72
trust

1393.679 --> 1400.24
god trust the design

1396.72 --> 1403.44
trust the mechanics of what it is like

1400.24 --> 1405.919
to be a human being to have sensations

1403.44 --> 1409.28
of these earthly sorts

1405.919 --> 1411.039
and how all of them are basically

1409.28 --> 1413.76
like nothing is permanent it's all

1411.039 --> 1415.679
sensation based is like an impulse

1413.76 --> 1417.76
like a squirt

1415.679 --> 1419.2800000000002
yeah squirting in the brain of certain

1417.76 --> 1421.6
thingies

1419.28 --> 1423.12
certain hormones certain effects is

1421.6 --> 1425.52
little squirt and then you have a

1423.12 --> 1428.3999999999999
sensation and it extreme at first and

1425.52 --> 1430.6399999999999
then it just fades away right that's

1428.4 --> 1432.4
it's very important to know

1430.64 --> 1434.3200000000002
especially when you're middle in it in

1432.4 --> 1437.6000000000001
the middle of it because

1434.32 --> 1440.3999999999999
for example fear typically kind of like

1437.6 --> 1442.08
derails

1440.4 --> 1444.72
your oversight

1442.08 --> 1447.279
over what is real so it's really

1444.72 --> 1449.039
important to actually know without

1447.279 --> 1451.039
feelings without just a standard

1449.039 --> 1454.559
sensation but to really actively

1451.039 --> 1456.799
consciously intellectually know

1454.559 --> 1457.76
that it influences you and that you

1456.799 --> 1460.799
shouldn't

1457.76 --> 1462.8799999999999
trust whatever story is rolling out

1460.799 --> 1464.559
while you are in fear

1462.88 --> 1465.7600000000002
right that's a very important thing to

1464.559 --> 1469.44
realize

1465.76 --> 1469.44
it's a great way to get over it

1469.919 --> 1474.3200000000002
do not empower

1472.88 --> 1478.5590000000002
okay

1474.32 --> 1478.559
good anyway hey hello cleary

1481.36 --> 1486.32
ooh that's a good one

1484.32 --> 1489.12
edgar

1486.32 --> 1491.36
said fear is the first sign of sin

1489.12 --> 1492.4799999999998
entering in yeah yeah that's a good

1491.36 --> 1494.9599999999998
point

1492.48 --> 1495.84
i think i basically just described that

1494.96 --> 1498.64
effect

1495.84 --> 1498.6399999999999
in my own way

1499.2 --> 1505.3600000000001
woo 2k almost what

1502.159 --> 1508.159
i have did i reach it no

1505.36 --> 1508.1589999999999
i don't think so

1510.0 --> 1515.84
no no no not yet almost though almost

1513.2 --> 1515.8400000000001
there

1516.24 --> 1519.1200000000001
oh come on

1523.12 --> 1529.36
let's see how many

1525.919 --> 1532.64
yeah i'm at the 1995

1529.36 --> 1532.6399999999999
so i'm almost there

1533.2 --> 1536.799
steadily

1534.32 --> 1536.799
growing

1536.88 --> 1541.0800000000002
the cap is off apparently

1545.12 --> 1551.6789999999999
you got excited well that's okay you

1547.76 --> 1551.679
know i think i'll probably be there

1551.76 --> 1555.32
in the next weekend

1558.08 --> 1561.799
so that's pretty cool

1572.88 --> 1577.2
right

1575.039 --> 1579.279
i don't know by the way why they always

1577.2 --> 1580.88
round out the number

1579.279 --> 1582.48
like why don't they have a special

1580.88 --> 1584.4
little function

1582.48 --> 1587.679
you just see that that

1584.4 --> 1588.48
rounded out number like in my case 1.99

1587.679 --> 1590.799
or

1588.48 --> 1593.1200000000001
for you maybe 2k

1590.799 --> 1595.679
and then when you hover over it that you

1593.12 --> 1598.2399999999998
get a micro pop-up to actually show you

1595.679 --> 1600.48
the exact number of subscribers like

1598.24 --> 1602.4
that would be much handier because now

1600.48 --> 1604.96
every time i want to check out the exact

1602.4 --> 1608.64
subscriber amount i have to go into my

1604.96 --> 1611.44
freaking youtube studio to see that

1608.64 --> 1611.44
it's kind of lame

1611.679 --> 1617.4
just another just stupid little

1614.4 --> 1617.4
technicalities

1620.159 --> 1623.919
hey

1621.24 --> 1626.919
1996 now

1623.919 --> 1626.919
huh

1627.679 --> 1633.1200000000001
okay oh by the way that this could also

1630.48 --> 1636.24
be i because if this happened before

1633.12 --> 1638.1589999999999
when i was approaching the thousand k

1636.24 --> 1640.48
i mean the thousand subs

1638.159 --> 1642.3990000000001
thousand k this is

1640.48 --> 1644.72
uh

1642.399 --> 1648.2399999999998
when trolls the anti-flat earth trolls

1644.72 --> 1650.48
get wind of some exciting moment

1648.24 --> 1653.1200000000001
like a number reached they typically

1650.48 --> 1655.76
like to then file on subscribe so that

1653.12 --> 1659.12
when you engage in celebrating then they

1655.76 --> 1661.36
all unsubscribe to make you look stupid

1659.12 --> 1663.039
so that might also be happening right

1661.36 --> 1666.6399999999999
that's why

1663.039 --> 1666.64
technically i don't really care

1666.84 --> 1673.52
right like they could have

1669.76 --> 1674.72
theoretically not actually built this up

1673.52 --> 1676.48
for like

1674.72 --> 1679.2
three years

1676.48 --> 1682.3990000000001
where they got all the socks ready and

1679.2 --> 1685.1200000000001
subscribed just to bring me down to a

1682.399 --> 1688.799
thousand subscribers once i reach the 2k

1685.12 --> 1691.279
mark some stupid juvenile joke like that

1688.799 --> 1693.44
it could happen i'm prepared for any

1691.279 --> 1696.399
stupid [ __ ] like that to happen so it

1693.44 --> 1698.24
just doesn't matter

1696.399 --> 1700.8799999999999
if it doesn't happen yeah

1698.24 --> 1700.88
so fine

1709.679 --> 1714.64
does 2k get you any privilege no no it

1712.24 --> 1714.64
doesn't

1722.48 --> 1727.279
like before i get any sort of other

1725.039 --> 1731.279
youtube privileges i have to get above

1727.279 --> 1732.799
the 10 000 subscribers so uh

1731.279 --> 1734.96
yeah

1732.799 --> 1734.96
no

1735.2 --> 1739.72
don't know if i'm ever gonna get there

1743.52 --> 1749.9189999999999
whatever the rollout has planned for me

1747.039 --> 1753.84
i have very little control over it

1749.919 --> 1753.8400000000001
never really had control over it

1766.48 --> 1769.48
hmm

1785.679 --> 1790.0
all right so

1787.679 --> 1793.3600000000001
yeah i'm up for talking about anything

1790.0 --> 1793.36
flat earth would be great

1793.44 --> 1796.64
i'd like

1794.399 --> 1799.1999999999998
address afghanistan again but i feel

1796.64 --> 1801.76
like now i'm just throwing onto the pile

1799.2 --> 1804.0800000000002
because i've just seen a lot of people

1801.76 --> 1806.08
say a lot of interesting things about it

1804.08 --> 1808.96
own benjamin did a whole episode about

1806.08 --> 1810.399
it

1808.96 --> 1813.3990000000001
it's like i don't know if i can add

1810.399 --> 1813.399
anything

1830.24 --> 1836.08
right maybe one statement i could make

1832.799 --> 1838.8799999999999
kind of like a declaration about it and

1836.08 --> 1841.12
that is that all these people that are

1838.88 --> 1841.1200000000001
like

1841.2 --> 1845.2
getting caught in tragedies and even on

1843.6 --> 1847.84
film and all that [ __ ]

1845.2 --> 1849.919
like they were all no they were all in

1847.84 --> 1850.9599999999998
the know that that was gonna happen

1849.919 --> 1854.7990000000002
right

1850.96 --> 1856.08
and here is the here is the actual issue

1854.799 --> 1858.8799999999999
right

1856.08 --> 1861.6
they knew this was gonna happen they

1858.88 --> 1863.44
knew this would happen when they do

1861.6 --> 1866.7199999999998
things like this

1863.44 --> 1870.64
they knew it 10 years ago even they've

1866.72 --> 1870.64
known this for a long time

1870.72 --> 1874.64
they let it happen like this

1874.96 --> 1880.48
what should have actually happened

1877.2 --> 1883.8400000000001
that kept in hindsight i know right

1880.48 --> 1886.32
is they should have evacuated everybody

1883.84 --> 1888.559
that was going to be at risk

1886.32 --> 1891.6789999999999
like all the people that have actually

1888.559 --> 1893.84
worked and especially like all the

1891.679 --> 1896.5590000000002
gay culture promoters they should have

1893.84 --> 1898.1589999999999
just freaking evacuated them before this

1896.559 --> 1900.1589999999999
was gonna happen

1898.159 --> 1902.72
because now they're all stuck now it's

1900.159 --> 1905.44
too late now they're [ __ ]

1902.72 --> 1907.84
and they let that happen

1905.44 --> 1907.8400000000001
right

1909.679 --> 1914.64
so that's really where the hurt comes in

1912.24 --> 1918.32
not that the taliban does what they does

1914.64 --> 1920.48
everybody knows they do that they say it

1918.32 --> 1921.9189999999999
proudly they do that they don't give a

1920.48 --> 1926.0
[ __ ]

1921.919 --> 1926.0
about what we feel about that they do it

1926.399 --> 1933.36
and we know they do it

1929.6 --> 1935.36
and if we don't want people to get hurt

1933.36 --> 1938.24
there

1935.36 --> 1942.6399999999999
because of involvements from the west

1938.24 --> 1945.679
then they should have been evacuated

1942.64 --> 1949.8400000000001
before the [ __ ] hit the fan

1945.679 --> 1949.8400000000001
which they knew was gonna happen

1951.36 --> 1954.32
and they did nothing

1954.48 --> 1958.72
people suspect and yeah might be

1956.88 --> 1961.1200000000001
something to it they suspect that they

1958.72 --> 1963.039
did it for dramatic effect

1961.12 --> 1965.1999999999998
right maybe like

1963.039 --> 1967.2
being all bleeding hard about it and

1965.2 --> 1969.039
like oh we're gonna go back because they

1967.2 --> 1971.279
always do that [ __ ]

1969.039 --> 1973.76
like get out oh everything is wrong oh

1971.279 --> 1976.88
we gotta go back uh yeah they always do

1973.76 --> 1978.72
that [ __ ] always always always so

1976.88 --> 1980.64
maybe

1978.72 --> 1982.48
that's the reason

1980.64 --> 1984.72
why they didn't do anything because they

1982.48 --> 1988.08
wanted the drama they needed the drama

1984.72 --> 1988.88
for some stupid political maneuvering

1988.08 --> 1991.039
or

1988.88 --> 1994.0
well as some people say just to make

1991.039 --> 1994.0
america look bad

1994.32 --> 1999.84
oh by the way and for people

1997.2 --> 2001.2
who think that taliban are are just

1999.84 --> 2005.76
monsters

2001.2 --> 2009.1200000000001
like not humans right but just monsters

2005.76 --> 2009.12
you gotta check this out

2011.679 --> 2016.72
watch the boys squirt

2014.88 --> 2019.1200000000001
yeah they're squirting a lot over at

2016.72 --> 2020.72
alex jones

2019.12 --> 2022.0
about this

2020.72 --> 2024.24
but

2022.0 --> 2026.88
yeah i gotta show you this one though

2024.24 --> 2029.279
this is just

2026.88 --> 2030.7990000000002
if you think that the taliban has no

2029.279 --> 2033.16
sense of humor

2030.799 --> 2036.08
think again

2033.16 --> 2038.559
[Music]

2036.08 --> 2038.559
hold on

2043.279 --> 2047.24
right look at that

2047.84 --> 2051.52
right

2049.2 --> 2053.2
a picture came out

2051.52 --> 2054.639
at uh

2053.2 --> 2056.96
from biden

2054.639 --> 2058.96
of him holding an ice cream right in

2056.96 --> 2061.359
response

2058.96 --> 2063.04
like to yeah you know what they do you

2061.359 --> 2065.52
know what the grabblers do they post

2063.04 --> 2066.96
with ice creams to seem all innocent and

2065.52 --> 2069.52
cute

2066.96 --> 2071.599
and these taliban guys just uploaded a

2069.52 --> 2075.599
photo of themselves holding an ice cream

2071.599 --> 2077.599
i just find that remarkably funny

2075.599 --> 2080.48
like if you think the taliban doesn't

2077.599 --> 2081.9190000000003
have a sense of humor think again

2080.48 --> 2084.8
oh yeah

2081.919 --> 2084.7999999999997
oh yeah they do

2086.8 --> 2091.8390000000004
i just thought that was remarkable

2089.359 --> 2095.159
oh wait hold on i didn't show it yeah

2091.839 --> 2095.159
here you go

2102.48 --> 2106.4
and like even the composure of the faces

2104.48 --> 2108.72
in this like

2106.4 --> 2108.7200000000003
dude

2108.88 --> 2114.52
think of the taliban what you will but

2110.72 --> 2114.52
that's freaking funny

2119.599 --> 2122.599
hmm

2132.24 --> 2136.72
all right it's just to show it yeah

2136.88 --> 2142.56
it is is it is funny it isn't it is

2139.359 --> 2144.3199999999997
isn't it one for the unit

2142.56 --> 2145.839
and also just the way they did it

2144.32 --> 2148.2400000000002
they're not like

2145.839 --> 2150.0
no they're just like

2148.24 --> 2152.3199999999997
ah it's

2150.0 --> 2152.32
dude

2156.24 --> 2160.9599999999996
i don't know

2157.44 --> 2160.96
i just thought that was remarkable

2161.839 --> 2166.32
all right these people are not just

2163.76 --> 2167.28
barbarians as everybody likes to make

2166.32 --> 2171.6400000000003
them out

2167.28 --> 2171.6400000000003
in a certain political class

2196.32 --> 2201.52
you have returned to know yes

2199.599 --> 2204.0
oh they wanted that no but there's also

2201.52 --> 2206.0
another project right

2204.0 --> 2210.0
this is literally

2206.0 --> 2211.599
like a corporate project

2210.0 --> 2214.56
because what is happening right now

2211.599 --> 2218.32
what's already being announced oh we got

2214.56 --> 2221.119
so many refugees because the me mean

2218.32 --> 2224.6400000000003
taliban took it over and now all the

2221.119 --> 2228.4
people that just want to be gay

2224.64 --> 2229.2
they need they want to go to europe

2228.4 --> 2231.839
so

2229.2 --> 2234.56
and america so we will

2231.839 --> 2237.359
we will open the gates again

2234.56 --> 2241.04
for the poor poor migrants

2237.359 --> 2242.48
and yeah they're not actually

2241.04 --> 2246.72
like refugees

2242.48 --> 2246.72
they're literally just economic migrants

2248.32 --> 2251.599
because there are just way too many

2250.32 --> 2254.8
people

2251.599 --> 2257.52
that are just on the move again

2254.8 --> 2258.96
it's a scam

2257.52 --> 2261.2
they're using

2258.96 --> 2264.079
the taliban takeover

2261.2 --> 2265.839
as a cover story

2264.079 --> 2268.079
to just get more

2265.839 --> 2270.7999999999997
migration going

2268.079 --> 2273.119
for liberal

2270.8 --> 2274.88
globalist control

2273.119 --> 2277.6800000000003
because they do that

2274.88 --> 2280.079
they want that they want other people

2277.68 --> 2281.44
from other countries to overrun

2280.079 --> 2283.52
everything

2281.44 --> 2288.0
and then try to leech

2283.52 --> 2288.0
them into joining their political side

2288.16 --> 2291.5989999999997
so what they constantly do

2290.48 --> 2293.119
right

2291.599 --> 2295.599
but i think

2293.119 --> 2297.76
that people like highly

2295.599 --> 2300.079
overestimate how many people are

2297.76 --> 2302.2400000000002
actually terrified of the taliban taking

2300.079 --> 2304.0
over

2302.24 --> 2306.56
i think that the vast majority is

2304.0 --> 2308.96
actually quite happy with them restoring

2306.56 --> 2312.0
order and getting all that gay crap out

2308.96 --> 2314.0
of here

2312.0 --> 2315.359
right because

2314.0 --> 2318.48
like

2315.359 --> 2320.0789999999997
the us government was literally trying

2318.48 --> 2322.079
to make them gay

2320.079 --> 2324.48
they were doing that [ __ ]

2322.079 --> 2326.5600000000004
and afghans are like

2324.48 --> 2328.48
that's satanic

2326.56 --> 2329.2799999999997
and it is

2328.48 --> 2332.4
right

2329.28 --> 2335.6800000000003
no wonder they freaking hate america

2332.4 --> 2337.6800000000003
to them it's babylon it's like

2335.68 --> 2340.24
for for a lot of people they they could

2337.68 --> 2342.24
like argue like oh yeah maybe america is

2340.24 --> 2344.3999999999996
babbling by its actions or sodom and

2342.24 --> 2346.9599999999996
gomorrah etc blah blah is definitely

2344.4 --> 2349.2000000000003
shady and imperial in nature and lying

2346.96 --> 2352.48
and double think and it is kind of

2349.2 --> 2353.359
covert communist well to the afghans

2352.48 --> 2354.96
like

2353.359 --> 2358.7999999999997
they don't have to

2354.96 --> 2361.359
postulate thera no to them it is it just

2358.8 --> 2363.599
is they freaking bump the [ __ ] out of

2361.359 --> 2363.5989999999997
them

2363.76 --> 2370.7200000000003
try to hunt them down

2366.48 --> 2370.72
terrorize women and children

2371.28 --> 2374.48
to them it just is

2379.68 --> 2387.839
all right so a lot of afghans were not

2383.68 --> 2387.839
unhappy at all for this to happen

2388.0 --> 2391.839
but yeah the the people that really went

2390.56 --> 2395.2799999999997
on that

2391.839 --> 2397.839
america gabe went bandwagon and [ __ ]

2395.28 --> 2399.8390000000004
super liberal

2397.839 --> 2401.68
yeah they are [ __ ]

2399.839 --> 2404.0
but they always knew that was gonna

2401.68 --> 2407.1189999999997
happen

2404.0 --> 2410.56
because that's what the taliban does

2407.119 --> 2413.2000000000003
like they just literally do not accept

2410.56 --> 2416.0
it like no matter what happens they will

2413.2 --> 2418.319
never accept that they will always

2416.0 --> 2420.079
drive you off the cliff

2418.319 --> 2422.079
metaphorically

2420.079 --> 2423.04
or literally

2422.079 --> 2425.2000000000003
like

2423.04 --> 2429.92
as soon as they get the chance they will

2425.2 --> 2432.24
just kick you out or execute you

2429.92 --> 2434.319
and that's just everybody knows that

2432.24 --> 2438.4399999999996
about them they're open about it they

2434.319 --> 2438.44
always have been like that

2439.52 --> 2442.52
huh

2452.56 --> 2455.92
yeah

2454.64 --> 2459.359
yeah

2455.92 --> 2459.359
that's right yeah they hang them

2463.28 --> 2466.88
are you making stuff up where are your

2465.359 --> 2468.48
sources

2466.88 --> 2470.079
i am my source

2468.48 --> 2472.4
so some is there something you can

2470.079 --> 2472.4
handle

2474.24 --> 2477.52
can you be more specific as to

2476.319 --> 2480.24
what

2477.52 --> 2482.64
stuff i am just making up so it's funny

2480.24 --> 2484.9599999999996
you know when very triggered pieces of

2482.64 --> 2487.2799999999997
[ __ ] trolls get in here it's like you're

2484.96 --> 2489.92
just making stuff up oh really what

2487.28 --> 2493.119
stuff did i make up

2489.92 --> 2494.8
what am i what stuff did i make up

2493.119 --> 2496.079
because i've been talking here on my

2494.8 --> 2498.8
show

2496.079 --> 2499.92
what about it did i make up what am i

2498.8 --> 2502.4
wrong about

2499.92 --> 2505.2000000000003
or you are just a triggered little [ __ ]

2502.4 --> 2508.0
and you're just going to randomly accuse

2505.2 --> 2509.839
me without being specific

2508.0 --> 2511.52
double jab who the [ __ ] caused

2509.839 --> 2514.64
themselves double jab anyway what kind

2511.52 --> 2514.64
of a freak does that

2515.2 --> 2519.839
lots of africans are happy to be taken

2517.44 --> 2521.92
over that's right

2519.839 --> 2525.359
you know why because they're the ones

2521.92 --> 2526.88
that have always lived there

2525.359 --> 2530.24
and they know

2526.88 --> 2530.2400000000002
it's not gonna go away

2531.599 --> 2537.839
you can't get rid of it so they just

2533.68 --> 2537.839
want the nonsense to stop

2545.599 --> 2550.6400000000003
okay take it easy there return to normal

2548.4 --> 2552.1600000000003
i was actually having a conversation

2550.64 --> 2555.359
sort of with him

2552.16 --> 2555.359
he was going to end up bad

2562.88 --> 2568.48
my vocabulary is exactly the same as

2565.76 --> 2570.6400000000003
trump says stuff like lots of people say

2568.48 --> 2572.2400000000002
i'm smart

2570.64 --> 2576.64
well

2572.24 --> 2576.64
been very very successful

2576.8 --> 2580.2400000000002
and yes

2578.64 --> 2582.56
terrible

2580.24 --> 2585.68
biden is so terrible

2582.56 --> 2587.92
like he didn't evacuate

2585.68 --> 2590.0
the gays properly

2587.92 --> 2591.44
you know we're supposed to be protecting

2590.0 --> 2593.28
the gays

2591.44 --> 2598.079
and well

2593.28 --> 2598.079
he should have just let them out quickly

2599.2 --> 2605.2
you know this is true but if i would

2602.0 --> 2607.04
have actually been instated because i

2605.2 --> 2609.839
won the election then this would have

2607.04 --> 2609.839
never happened

2610.48 --> 2615.079
because i am the best

2626.16 --> 2632.68
better than gollum is it

2628.16 --> 2632.68
i don't know if my trump is very good

2639.92 --> 2645.44
that's right nathan r he oh dude trump

2643.119 --> 2647.6800000000003
would have literally rolled out the red

2645.44 --> 2649.839
carpet for them and evacuated them on

2647.68 --> 2652.48
private jets if he needed to

2649.839 --> 2655.2799999999997
dude trump is the gayest president that

2652.48 --> 2655.28
has ever lived

2656.72 --> 2661.8799999999997
but that's not necessarily a bad thing

2663.76 --> 2668.5600000000004
although it's not a really good thing

2665.44 --> 2670.079
but he's been like extremely

2668.56 --> 2672.319
pro-gay

2670.079 --> 2672.319
like

2672.96 --> 2677.839
really just look at what everything has

2674.88 --> 2677.839
happened

2682.0 --> 2686.48
i wouldn't explain it is rebel

2684.24 --> 2687.5989999999997
no i've always tried to trump but i i

2686.48 --> 2690.88
don't know

2687.599 --> 2692.88
i've a bit trouble getting into it

2690.88 --> 2694.48
my golem is much easier like i know

2692.88 --> 2697.52
everything about gollum i know i

2694.48 --> 2697.52
understand gollum

2697.76 --> 2702.28
there's a piece of me that is like that

2709.76 --> 2715.599
like the whole

2711.359 --> 2717.839
conflict with the other side of himself

2715.599 --> 2719.28
sounds really weird right i know what

2717.839 --> 2722.72
that is

2719.28 --> 2722.7200000000003
in ways i have that

2729.76 --> 2735.28
when like the inner conflict really

2731.599 --> 2735.28
causes you to kind of split up

2738.0 --> 2740.64
it's weird

2742.16 --> 2749.04
hey pj crew shank good to see you

2746.64 --> 2749.04
alright

2752.24 --> 2755.68
don't be too hard to double

2754.24 --> 2758.4799999999996
lol

2755.68 --> 2762.0789999999997
i don't think he subscribed

2758.48 --> 2762.079
and he's banned anyway so

2763.92 --> 2770.599
maybe i should unban him but he probably

2765.76 --> 2770.599
went away to make a new soccer gun but

2774.8 --> 2778.2400000000002
oh he calls him trunk yeah but it's

2776.48 --> 2781.2400000000002
actually drunk with a q

2778.24 --> 2781.24
though

2796.16 --> 2799.16
uh

2834.88 --> 2837.839
yeah he's gone

2839.359 --> 2842.5989999999997
oh well

2866.72 --> 2869.7599999999998
pride

2867.839 --> 2870.839
anyway so yeah that was something i had

2869.76 --> 2872.8
to say

2870.839 --> 2875.44
like

2872.8 --> 2875.44
i don't think

2875.76 --> 2880.0
there's anything

2877.2 --> 2882.72
we could or should really do about the

2880.0 --> 2882.72
taliban

2883.2 --> 2887.4399999999996
like it just wouldn't work but the whole

2885.359 --> 2889.52
situation should have been

2887.44 --> 2890.7200000000003
approached differently and it was kind

2889.52 --> 2894.319
of like

2890.72 --> 2896.3999999999996
neglected on purpose to create a tragedy

2894.319 --> 2900.04
probably to attempt

2896.4 --> 2903.599
to create a pretext to engage in some

2900.04 --> 2905.599
military-industrial complex action again

2903.599 --> 2908.1600000000003
that's usually the reason why they

2905.599 --> 2909.28
neglect [ __ ] like that

2908.16 --> 2911.52
right

2909.28 --> 2914.4
it has a similar feeling to the

2911.52 --> 2917.28
situation with libya

2914.4 --> 2919.6800000000003
where they basically just let the

2917.28 --> 2922.559
us diplomat get killed they didn't

2919.68 --> 2922.5589999999997
evacuate him

2923.76 --> 2928.8
that's yeah that was a real tragedy like

2926.64 --> 2931.1189999999997
a notorious tragedy for a lot of

2928.8 --> 2933.8390000000004
americans

2931.119 --> 2933.839
back in the day

2938.319 --> 2944.4
surely deadly plague fires will dude

2942.16 --> 2946.319
they forbid it

2944.4 --> 2948.1600000000003
you're not allowed to do that anymore

2946.319 --> 2950.5589999999997
it's like

2948.16 --> 2952.16
it's not like oh we don't sell them

2950.559 --> 2954.96
anymore no it's just like no it's

2952.16 --> 2956.48
forbidden you're not allowed to do that

2954.96 --> 2958.079
or it's freaking

2956.48 --> 2959.359
i don't know off with your head or

2958.079 --> 2961.3590000000004
something

2959.359 --> 2963.839
it's like yeah no they're not going to

2961.359 --> 2966.7999999999997
get any covert issues over there they're

2963.839 --> 2969.359
not going to see any freaking delta ryan

2966.8 --> 2971.8390000000004
now they're just going to be fine

2969.359 --> 2973.7599999999998
although yeah maybe a little hungry

2971.839 --> 2975.92
that is a bit of a problem because yeah

2973.76 --> 2978.88
the band crashed and [ __ ]

2975.92 --> 2980.7200000000003
yeah that's the unfortunate consequences

2978.88 --> 2983.96
of the taliban

2980.72 --> 2983.9599999999996
set up

2984.24 --> 2989.359
infidel viruses

2987.359 --> 2992.68
okay well i don't know if that's really

2989.359 --> 2992.68
funny though

3008.319 --> 3012.4
what about this plane video

3011.04 --> 3014.5589999999997
yeah

3012.4 --> 3016.2400000000002
well that's just

3014.559 --> 3019.28
what about the pla it is people

3016.24 --> 3021.1189999999997
panicking it is people

3019.28 --> 3023.52
that

3021.119 --> 3026.559
probably worked for the united states

3023.52 --> 3027.7599999999998
those are locals hired for the united

3026.559 --> 3029.6800000000003
states

3027.76 --> 3031.8390000000004
they're super poor they have nowhere to

3029.68 --> 3034.319
go and they know

3031.839 --> 3036.48
that yeah the taliban will get them for

3034.319 --> 3039.44
having worked with the americans

3036.48 --> 3041.119
and that is tragic it is it is not

3039.44 --> 3044.079
something that

3041.119 --> 3045.359
anybody should be happy about

3044.079 --> 3047.52
but it could have been prevented

3045.359 --> 3050.0
potentially if if they were just

3047.52 --> 3052.4
evacuated like the whole

3050.0 --> 3055.359
bunch should have been evacuated before

3052.4 --> 3057.839
the taliban was going to take over

3055.359 --> 3058.88
and they just let it happen

3057.839 --> 3062.319
right

3058.88 --> 3065.839
they pulled the locals into

3062.319 --> 3068.079
the united states dream and involvement

3065.839 --> 3071.04
and then they just went away and let

3068.079 --> 3071.04
them get killed

3071.76 --> 3074.4
right

3072.8 --> 3076.88
that's how you should look at this

3074.4 --> 3079.6800000000003
because that's exactly what happened

3076.88 --> 3083.28
they knew this was going to happen

3079.68 --> 3085.52
and they just let that happen

3083.28 --> 3088.0
it's very brutal

3085.52 --> 3088.0
and like

3088.96 --> 3093.44
yeah think about it like this the world

3091.52 --> 3094.559
is watching right that as this is

3093.44 --> 3097.839
unfolding

3094.559 --> 3099.44
you think that in the future if america

3097.839 --> 3101.599
like oh let's

3099.44 --> 3104.0
get control of this country let's

3101.599 --> 3106.0
protect it with our military but you

3104.0 --> 3109.359
think that the locals there are now

3106.0 --> 3111.2
going to be like oh yeah america oh

3109.359 --> 3112.88
yeah that's great man oh work with

3111.2 --> 3115.2799999999997
america oh

3112.88 --> 3117.599
yeah they just saw that

3115.28 --> 3119.6800000000003
well people that have done that

3117.599 --> 3122.079
they were literally abandoned to be

3119.68 --> 3122.0789999999997
murdered

3122.64 --> 3127.04
right this is not good for american

3124.96 --> 3130.64
reputation at all

3127.04 --> 3130.64
from any perspective

3136.8 --> 3140.559
do i go with the caliphate no

3141.359 --> 3147.04
no i already said i'm not gonna have

3143.92 --> 3149.76
oh let's talk about the taliban and we

3147.04 --> 3153.04
need to know every freaking thing about

3149.76 --> 3154.8
the taliban no

3153.04 --> 3157.359
the the most important thing you need to

3154.8 --> 3159.76
know about them is leave them the [ __ ]

3157.359 --> 3159.7599999999998
alone

3160.48 --> 3165.68
don't try to take their land and don't

3163.44 --> 3167.839
try to make them gay and you'll be all

3165.68 --> 3167.839
right

3174.8 --> 3180.3590000000004
caliphate is the share oh okay

3177.359 --> 3180.359
whatever

3180.8 --> 3184.1600000000003
that's like islamic

3183.2 --> 3186.48
uh

3184.16 --> 3189.2799999999997
governmental structure right internals

3186.48 --> 3193.64
is whatever i don't know

3189.28 --> 3193.6400000000003
i'm not so interested in that

3199.28 --> 3202.92
hey clutch bear

3222.4 --> 3228.7200000000003
others in chat saying fake plane

3226.0 --> 3228.72
i don't know

3233.04 --> 3237.92
i've seen like footage from various

3235.599 --> 3240.4
directions and look

3237.92 --> 3242.319
do not underestimate how terror

3240.4 --> 3245.52
inspiring

3242.319 --> 3248.8
the taliban are like i i can definitely

3245.52 --> 3250.8
imagine people in their panic would

3248.8 --> 3253.44
like risk

3250.8 --> 3254.96
thinking they could like survive on the

3253.44 --> 3257.2000000000003
wing of a plane

3254.96 --> 3257.2
right

3260.319 --> 3264.5589999999997
so

3261.44 --> 3268.839
i can't say for sure but i i wouldn't be

3264.559 --> 3268.8390000000004
surprised if it were real

3297.839 --> 3300.839
um

3309.839 --> 3317.16
the islamic state was crushed

3312.559 --> 3317.1600000000003
that that doesn't really work

3338.4 --> 3342.88
what what are you saying dutch said what

3343.119 --> 3348.28
it's all fearful no it's just

3352.079 --> 3357.3590000000004
it's just trauma

3353.68 --> 3359.68
right not fair porn [ __ ] is happening

3357.359 --> 3361.2799999999997
it's just they've all put it out of

3359.68 --> 3363.68
context

3361.28 --> 3365.8390000000004
and you just shove it in your face like

3363.68 --> 3369.2
oh look at the torture look at the word

3365.839 --> 3371.44
oh no this is so tragic instead of just

3369.2 --> 3373.5989999999997
saying like yeah

3371.44 --> 3376.16
everybody involved here

3373.599 --> 3379.2000000000003
knew this was gonna happen and on

3376.16 --> 3381.52
purpose nobody evacuated way ahead of

3379.2 --> 3384.799
time when it was all very cheap very

3381.52 --> 3387.92
easy very doable and they didn't do it

3384.799 --> 3391.2
because they wanted this moment to shove

3387.92 --> 3393.76
in your face the terror and pain and

3391.2 --> 3397.2
make you feel even more

3393.76 --> 3400.559
miserable about yourself and the world

3397.2 --> 3401.9199999999996
that's what it really is not fear porn

3400.559 --> 3404.559
it's just

3401.92 --> 3406.559
like mind torture

3404.559 --> 3408.559
on purpose

3406.559 --> 3410.7200000000003
on purpose shoving it in your face

3408.559 --> 3413.3590000000004
making you hurt

3410.72 --> 3416.48
right it was all preventable

3413.359 --> 3420.24
they let it happen so they could shove

3416.48 --> 3422.48
the torturous pain in your face and make

3420.24 --> 3425.7599999999998
you sick over it

3422.48 --> 3428.799
right traumatize you into

3425.76 --> 3430.8390000000004
going with some dramatical decision at

3428.799 --> 3433.2
some point that's what they do it's

3430.839 --> 3435.359
politicians yeah

3433.2 --> 3438.96
they let things happen and then they

3435.359 --> 3441.2799999999997
torture you with it into submission

3438.96 --> 3444.44
that's what the beast does that's what

3441.28 --> 3444.44
it does

3449.119 --> 3452.119
hmm

3478.24 --> 3483.1189999999997
yeah do you understand every time you

3480.88 --> 3486.4
see that [ __ ] on tv

3483.119 --> 3489.04
like people dropping from planes or

3486.4 --> 3492.319
getting corralled or being hanged or

3489.04 --> 3494.24
terrible yeah just think very carefully

3492.319 --> 3495.839
about that

3494.24 --> 3497.4399999999996
this was all

3495.839 --> 3501.52
known

3497.44 --> 3502.68
well known in detail far ahead of time

3501.52 --> 3504.24
and it was

3502.68 --> 3507.2799999999997
decided

3504.24 --> 3510.9599999999996
not to do anything

3507.28 --> 3512.88
ignored on purpose the cries like help

3510.96 --> 3514.16
us help us we need to be evacuated

3512.88 --> 3516.079
they're going to go over on us and

3514.16 --> 3517.92
execute us all we worked with you

3516.079 --> 3522.0
they're going to kill us for it please

3517.92 --> 3524.7200000000003
evacuate us and they didn't do it

3522.0 --> 3527.44
they didn't do it on purpose

3524.72 --> 3531.2
don't you get it

3527.44 --> 3532.88
you're being showed the fruit of their

3531.2 --> 3535.5989999999997
product

3532.88 --> 3537.359
and they did it on purpose that torture

3535.599 --> 3539.44
you with it

3537.359 --> 3542.0
and then leave out how they could have

3539.44 --> 3545.0
prevented all of that they did it on

3542.0 --> 3545.0
purpose

3556.72 --> 3560.72
but biden's probably gonna get it over

3558.72 --> 3563.5989999999997
this i wouldn't be surprised if this is

3560.72 --> 3564.9599999999996
gonna lead to like a resignation level

3563.599 --> 3567.6800000000003
scandal

3564.96 --> 3567.68
is it should

3568.16 --> 3571.7599999999998
it's

3569.079 --> 3574.2400000000002
unbelievably irresponsible on a human

3571.76 --> 3576.48
level and on a political level what he's

3574.24 --> 3576.4799999999996
done

3578.319 --> 3582.88
it's a laughingstock of

3580.88 --> 3584.7200000000003
world politics at the moment

3582.88 --> 3587.28
literally

3584.72 --> 3589.4399999999996
literally the laughingstock of the world

3587.28 --> 3592.4
right now biden because of this

3589.44 --> 3595.119
this stupid ice cream photograph

3592.4 --> 3597.599
so much the laughingstock

3595.119 --> 3601.119
that even the taliban can be

3597.599 --> 3603.44
humorous about it

3601.119 --> 3603.44
right

3612.88 --> 3616.48
why would military take off with people

3614.88 --> 3618.7200000000003
on the plane

3616.48 --> 3618.72
uh

3625.28 --> 3629.559
because they had to go

3629.92 --> 3634.64
i'm not entirely sure as to what exactly

3632.559 --> 3636.559
how it happened over there with that

3634.64 --> 3638.319
plane situation

3636.559 --> 3639.92
and i'm pretty sure they were just given

3638.319 --> 3642.16
a deadline it's like okay if you don't

3639.92 --> 3644.88
leave exactly before this time we're

3642.16 --> 3647.7599999999998
just gonna open fire right something

3644.88 --> 3649.76
like that i'm not sure though i i

3647.76 --> 3651.44
don't know the details

3649.76 --> 3656.8390000000004
but i had a pretty good they had a

3651.44 --> 3656.839
pretty good reason to to leave quickly

3661.92 --> 3664.7200000000003
i don't know man

3668.0 --> 3670.559
right

3669.359 --> 3672.4
so yeah

3670.559 --> 3674.96
i hope that's enough

3672.4 --> 3679.4
for you guys it's not really a subject i

3674.96 --> 3679.4
like to talk about all day long

3704.16 --> 3712.0789999999997
400 300k afghan troops yeah but what is

3707.44 --> 3715.76
the point of having all those troops

3712.079 --> 3715.76
if you're gonna be abandoned

3716.559 --> 3722.2400000000002
by the the apparatus

3719.44 --> 3724.48
like you know what demoralization does

3722.24 --> 3726.4799999999996
to people

3724.48 --> 3729.599
doesn't matter dude they could have had

3726.48 --> 3730.96
like three million troops

3729.599 --> 3733.28
trained

3730.96 --> 3736.319
if you're going to just abandon them

3733.28 --> 3738.2400000000002
they're not going to be able to fight

3736.319 --> 3740.079
because they don't have any backing

3738.24 --> 3742.319
anymore they've been abandoned that's

3740.079 --> 3745.2000000000003
extremely demoralizing many of them will

3742.319 --> 3747.0389999999998
be like well [ __ ] you then i'll just

3745.2 --> 3748.24
join the freaking taliban with my

3747.039 --> 3749.8390000000004
training

3748.24 --> 3751.1189999999997
maybe i don't know if that's even

3749.839 --> 3752.5589999999997
possible it's

3751.119 --> 3755.28
i don't know

3752.559 --> 3757.3590000000004
but yeah demoralization

3755.28 --> 3761.2400000000002
does a lot of damage

3757.359 --> 3761.24
even to large numbers

3780.64 --> 3785.359
besides what were they really fighting

3782.559 --> 3788.799
for for the right to be gay

3785.359 --> 3788.799
for rainbow flags

3789.92 --> 3793.2000000000003
and well

3791.839 --> 3795.44
like

3793.2 --> 3797.52
unmasked women

3795.44 --> 3801.2000000000003
right we take that for granted they

3797.52 --> 3803.52
don't they really don't want that

3801.2 --> 3805.1189999999997
all those things all those alterations

3803.52 --> 3806.559
westernizations

3805.119 --> 3810.0
they

3806.559 --> 3811.6800000000003
most don't really want that

3810.0 --> 3814.079
i mean of course there will be some that

3811.68 --> 3817.2
will just want the freedom

3814.079 --> 3819.92
right oh get them over to another

3817.2 --> 3819.9199999999996
country then

3821.28 --> 3826.76
it's not gonna work there you can't

3822.96 --> 3826.76
force it on them

3838.4 --> 3843.319
i have four more hours aisles g hello

3892.24 --> 3896.8799999999997
a steamy traveler how's the roommate

3894.079 --> 3896.88
situated i don't know

3899.119 --> 3903.2000000000003
i don't know if she's gonna take it or

3901.52 --> 3906.079
anything she probably would she really

3903.2 --> 3906.0789999999997
did like the room

3906.799 --> 3910.559
but yeah just came by for a look so

3909.119 --> 3913.92
whatever

3910.559 --> 3916.96
i'm over that right now

3913.92 --> 3916.96
we'll see what happens

3919.119 --> 3924.799
usually when i get lightning whipped it

3921.599 --> 3926.96
it turns into like just a highly bitter

3924.799 --> 3929.52
disappointed situation

3926.96 --> 3931.599
so i try not to put too much weight on

3929.52 --> 3931.599
it

3934.96 --> 3938.799
it's just that yesterday in the

3936.4 --> 3941.76
beginning you really got to see the sh

3938.799 --> 3941.7599999999998
the raw effect

3942.96 --> 3948.2400000000002
it was just being lightning whipped

3945.28 --> 3950.6400000000003
and it really just before that happened

3948.24 --> 3952.8799999999997
pretty much like

3950.64 --> 3952.8799999999997
so

3960.88 --> 3965.359
return to them why why

3963.44 --> 3967.76
why would you want why would you bring

3965.359 --> 3967.7599999999998
that up

3970.72 --> 3974.24
what you're going to be looking out for

3972.559 --> 3975.2000000000003
those

3974.24 --> 3978.8799999999997
like

3975.2 --> 3983.319
oh good new execution video like

3978.88 --> 3983.319
why why bring that up

3994.88 --> 3998.6800000000003
why bring it up

4013.839 --> 4017.119
that's

4015.119 --> 4020.839
oh you think it will happen that's why

4017.119 --> 4020.839
you bring it up okay

4056.079 --> 4059.079
oh

4066.72 --> 4071.72
all right anyway i'll be back in two

4068.72 --> 4071.72
minutes

4164.56 --> 4167.56
hmm

4193.679 --> 4195.92
uh

4200.84 --> 4206.1990000000005
damned yeah i don't know about that

4236.08 --> 4239.92
oh look double jabs back

4238.32 --> 4242.5599999999995
ah you finally figured out he was

4239.92 --> 4244.4800000000005
unbanned goody

4242.56 --> 4246.64
conspiracy mindset

4244.48 --> 4249.5199999999995
videos appear more propaganda they don't

4246.64 --> 4252.8
cover up really what's that said

4249.52 --> 4252.8
who is covering up what

4256.4 --> 4259.839999999999
right and yeah that is kind of how it

4258.8 --> 4263.1990000000005
works

4259.84 --> 4267.1990000000005
but that's not a conspiracy mindset that

4263.199 --> 4270.719
is literally playbook operating

4267.199 --> 4273.28
yeah that's how they operate

4270.719 --> 4276.4
either you if you're gonna show it then

4273.28 --> 4278.719
you have to use it for something

4276.4 --> 4281.44
right because otherwise you might risk

4278.719 --> 4284.08
the people making up their own minds

4281.44 --> 4286.879999999999
that's the freaking point of propaganda

4284.08 --> 4289.36
right and if they hide it well then they

4286.88 --> 4291.4400000000005
better have a really good reason to hide

4289.36 --> 4294.88
it because of course people are gonna

4291.44 --> 4294.879999999999
find out it's being hidden

4295.12 --> 4297.76
that's all

4299.28 --> 4304.639999999999
any of this no oh really

4302.32 --> 4308.96
how about

4304.64 --> 4312.2390000000005
a century of media history huh

4308.96 --> 4315.52
news and media history yeah yeah

4312.239 --> 4317.12
there is evidence everything backs that

4315.52 --> 4320.320000000001
up everything

4317.12 --> 4323.04
everything not speculation historical

4320.32 --> 4323.04
reality

4325.44 --> 4331.919999999999
historical reality not speculation

4328.96 --> 4334.88
and not narrative historical reality

4331.92 --> 4336.56
recorded media history

4334.88 --> 4338.2390000000005
of propaganda

4336.56 --> 4340.8
and media news

4338.239 --> 4343.678999999999
yeah historically

4340.8 --> 4347.360000000001
accurate reality

4343.679 --> 4347.36
happening over and over again

4351.52 --> 4356.719
right but i already laid down the entire

4354.32 --> 4360.0
situation

4356.719 --> 4363.44
of what is this all about right

4360.0 --> 4364.719
media just wants to torture you

4363.44 --> 4366.799999999999
with [ __ ]

4364.719 --> 4368.8
to make you squirt to make you panic to

4366.8 --> 4371.76
make you more malleable

4368.8 --> 4376.08
for control

4371.76 --> 4376.08
that's just a reality fact

4378.08 --> 4381.92
yeah

4379.12 --> 4384.32
they are not going to tell you yeah all

4381.92 --> 4386.159
of this could have been prevented

4384.32 --> 4387.759999999999
like all of it

4386.159 --> 4389.759999999999
all these people could have been

4387.76 --> 4391.12
evacuated nobody would have jumped to

4389.76 --> 4393.04
their deaths

4391.12 --> 4397.48
almost nobody would have been executed

4393.04 --> 4397.48
they'd always find somebody right

4399.52 --> 4404.159000000001
no no no they're not gonna do say that

4402.32 --> 4404.96
they're not gonna make

4404.159 --> 4407.199
you

4404.96 --> 4409.199
watch documentaries about that

4407.199 --> 4411.12
constantly like yeah all of these deaths

4409.199 --> 4413.199
could have been prevented right they're

4411.12 --> 4416.32
not gonna tell you that at the beginning

4413.199 --> 4417.44
and the end of every freaking execution

4416.32 --> 4419.28
terror

4417.44 --> 4420.799999999999
clip you're gonna see

4419.28 --> 4423.04
of this time

4420.8 --> 4425.12
that are gonna be made in this period

4423.04 --> 4428.239
now they're just gonna show you that and

4425.12 --> 4430.48
see oh look at the barbarians this is

4428.239 --> 4433.28
they want to come after your country

4430.48 --> 4435.28
they want to come after your country

4433.28 --> 4437.84
you have to go to war

4435.28 --> 4439.92
because they're evil people they're evil

4437.84 --> 4442.88
people that's what they're gonna do and

4439.92 --> 4446.4400000000005
you freaking well know it [ __ ]

4442.88 --> 4446.4400000000005
you know it

4447.63 --> 4450.709
[Music]

4462.4 --> 4465.4
so

4471.92 --> 4476.1990000000005
hey amanda young good to see you

4487.76 --> 4490.56
okay

4490.719 --> 4497.2390000000005
not everybody joe carter

4492.88 --> 4497.2390000000005
who are you addressing right away

4504.719 --> 4507.76
the refugees

4506.48 --> 4511.599999999999
you mean

4507.76 --> 4515.04
the economic migrants

4511.6 --> 4515.04
they're not refugees

4515.44 --> 4521.44
not refugees economic migrants yeah

4518.719 --> 4524.56
vast amount of people

4521.44 --> 4526.639999999999
that are not fleeing they're not fleeing

4524.56 --> 4528.56
from the taliban

4526.64 --> 4530.159000000001
a lot of them probably have pretty good

4528.56 --> 4532.320000000001
relations with the taliban and they're

4530.159 --> 4536.719
just politically seizing this

4532.32 --> 4541.28
opportunity to bluff the gullible gay

4536.719 --> 4543.84
western world in accepting them

4541.28 --> 4546.4
so they can be pampered to

4543.84 --> 4548.32
in the western countries

4546.4 --> 4551.12
because they could just say we're

4548.32 --> 4554.4
refugees and the liberals quarters will

4551.12 --> 4558.4
just buy it and force that [ __ ] nonsense

4554.4 --> 4558.4
on everybody and just reel them in

4559.04 --> 4563.12
there's barely any refugees

4562.239 --> 4565.28
like

4563.12 --> 4567.12
they don't make it out

4565.28 --> 4571.599999999999
yeah

4567.12 --> 4571.599999999999
taliban doesn't let people go

4572.4 --> 4578.879999999999
they hunt them down okay that's what

4575.199 --> 4581.678999999999
they really do there is no refugees

4578.88 --> 4583.76
they just get killed they're not allowed

4581.679 --> 4586.159
to go they can't go they would have to

4583.76 --> 4588.4800000000005
be actively evacuated

4586.159 --> 4591.5199999999995
in an organized effort

4588.48 --> 4594.08
right these are migrants

4591.52 --> 4596.64
probably most of them are friendly with

4594.08 --> 4597.679
the taliban and they're now making their

4596.64 --> 4601.76
move

4597.679 --> 4604.0
for economic gain under cover

4601.76 --> 4607.6
of being refugees

4604.0 --> 4609.92
with the blessings of the taliban it's a

4607.6 --> 4612.08
plan they're just using the crazy

4609.92 --> 4614.56
situation to get a little advantage who

4612.08 --> 4617.199
would blame them for it you know they've

4614.56 --> 4619.1990000000005
been on their sickening war

4617.199 --> 4621.04
forever and now their economy has

4619.199 --> 4623.759999999999
completely crashed of course they're

4621.04 --> 4625.5199999999995
gonna send out people to try to get some

4623.76 --> 4628.0
money

4625.52 --> 4629.76
to restore

4628.0 --> 4632.48
some yeah

4629.76 --> 4634.8
some economics in their country that's

4632.48 --> 4636.44
what you do

4634.8 --> 4639.6
yeah they're not

4636.44 --> 4642.96
refugees and they're not sleeper terror

4639.6 --> 4646.56
cells either they're economic migrants

4642.96 --> 4648.96
they are there for making money and then

4646.56 --> 4651.679
sending it to their country to build it

4648.96 --> 4654.0
back up again because it's been torn by

4651.679 --> 4654.0
war

4654.96 --> 4659.0
yeah for two decades

4664.08 --> 4667.44
so yes court for me

4668.239 --> 4671.199
that's the reality

4676.84 --> 4681.28
right

4678.4 --> 4684.08
like they hate the liberals liberals are

4681.28 --> 4686.5599999999995
literally the devil to them

4684.08 --> 4689.5199999999995
but they will play with the devil

4686.56 --> 4691.120000000001
they will play them and they know

4689.52 --> 4694.64
that the left

4691.12 --> 4696.32
would let in any crazy anti-western

4694.64 --> 4697.280000000001
group

4696.32 --> 4700.639999999999
just

4697.28 --> 4703.28
to like poison the grounds

4700.64 --> 4705.4400000000005
and make more people bite in their

4703.28 --> 4706.48
political system

4705.44 --> 4708.08
yeah

4706.48 --> 4709.678999999999
they know this

4708.08 --> 4712.48
they know

4709.679 --> 4716.4
the western people do that [ __ ] to their

4712.48 --> 4719.599999999999
own so they're just using that system

4716.4 --> 4722.239
they're just using it they're using you

4719.6 --> 4724.8
they're using the liberals

4722.239 --> 4727.199
liberal squirters

4724.8 --> 4728.88
the poor refugees that's gonna freaking

4727.199 --> 4731.839999999999
worship them

4728.88 --> 4734.56
not punish them if they like kill people

4731.84 --> 4736.32
in their own in in their in the new

4734.56 --> 4739.04
country

4736.32 --> 4740.08
they know this [ __ ]

4739.04 --> 4743.12
yeah

4740.08 --> 4745.5199999999995
are you blaming them or should you blame

4743.12 --> 4747.92
somebody else for that the people that

4745.52 --> 4749.84
actually allow that to just happen the

4747.92 --> 4752.4800000000005
way it does

4768.0 --> 4771.84
yeah that's gonna happen yeah is that

4770.8 --> 4774.719
the

4771.84 --> 4777.84
the taliban fault

4774.719 --> 4779.12
or is that the freaks

4777.84 --> 4781.6
communist

4779.12 --> 4784.76
freaks in control

4781.6 --> 4786.4800000000005
that are setting it up like that to

4784.76 --> 4788.8
destroy

4786.48 --> 4788.799999999999
you

4788.96 --> 4792.88

4818.239 --> 4822.638999999999
of the devil's tools

4820.719 --> 4824.96
that's what communism is

4822.639 --> 4828.2390000000005
that's what atheist

4824.96 --> 4830.08
devil worshiping communism is and that's

4828.239 --> 4832.638999999999
what they're doing that's who is in

4830.08 --> 4834.8
control that's who's going to censor you

4832.639 --> 4836.2390000000005
when your people get murdered on the

4834.8 --> 4838.639
streets again

4836.239 --> 4840.32
because they pulled in

4838.639 --> 4843.28
a bunch of

4840.32 --> 4845.679
extremely different foreigners under the

4843.28 --> 4846.48
guise of refugees

4845.679 --> 4848.96
yeah

4846.48 --> 4850.959999999999
and handing them everything everything

4848.96 --> 4854.32
that you have to struggle for that you

4850.96 --> 4857.52
have to sit through endless bureaucratic

4854.32 --> 4859.759999999999
garbage and shaming tactics

4857.52 --> 4861.1990000000005
they'll just give it to them in your

4859.76 --> 4865.4400000000005
face

4861.199 --> 4865.44
yeah because it's the [ __ ] communists

4865.679 --> 4871.92
it's not the taliban it's the communists

4869.04 --> 4874.92
the communists are the problem not the

4871.92 --> 4874.92
taliban

4895.76 --> 4898.76
ah

4911.84 --> 4921.360000000001

4928.239 --> 4935.759999999999
scorched earth desert hell

4931.76 --> 4938.400000000001
that's what they do they cannot help it

4935.76 --> 4943.280000000001
they are literally possessed by the

4938.4 --> 4947.879999999999
devil irrevocably until they die

4943.28 --> 4947.88
so better get on with it already

4977.6 --> 4980.6
do

4998.0 --> 5001.4
yeah it's a little really triggered

5000.159 --> 5005.199
fondy

5001.4 --> 5007.44
scumbag satanic pieces of [ __ ] in here

5005.199 --> 5010.0
yeah i know a lot of you flat earthers

5007.44 --> 5011.839999999999
are beyond

5010.0 --> 5015.52
beyond humanity

5011.84 --> 5018.4800000000005
you are so reversed world in everything

5015.52 --> 5020.96
everything

5018.48 --> 5023.199
in your mind is the opposite of reality

5020.96 --> 5026.56
it's not even just the globe everything

5023.199 --> 5031.36
you are a demonic vessel

5026.56 --> 5032.4800000000005
a demonic vessel a husk a zombie

5031.36 --> 5034.88
there

5032.48 --> 5037.04
to be possessed by the spirit that has

5034.88 --> 5041.52
only one goal

5037.04 --> 5045.679
the destruction of all life that is what

5041.52 --> 5046.96
you ride with [ __ ] and we know it

5045.679 --> 5050.4800000000005
we know it

5046.96 --> 5053.28
and knowing it means it's gonna end

5050.48 --> 5053.28
do you understand

5053.44 --> 5058.96
we figured out the devil's trick and

5056.0 --> 5062.6
that means it's gonna end

5058.96 --> 5062.6
prepare yourself

5073.36 --> 5076.36
so

5106.88 --> 5111.4400000000005
a recreational drunk and a believer of

5109.44 --> 5113.839999999999
space balls

5111.44 --> 5118.96
space balls

5113.84 --> 5118.96
better watch out for the space balls

5120.719 --> 5125.4
i gotta watch that movie again such a

5122.4 --> 5125.4
classic

5129.239 --> 5137.08
merchandising merchandising this is what

5132.32 --> 5137.08
the movie really is made for

5140.48 --> 5146.44
especially the spaceballs flamethrower

5150.96 --> 5154.6
power of the swords

5157.52 --> 5162.88
the swatch isn't you lone star i just

5160.4 --> 5166.4
got that ring out of a cracker jack box

5162.88 --> 5166.400000000001
the swartz is in you

5166.56 --> 5169.84
oh great stuff

5217.3 --> 5221.4800000000005
[Music]

5218.48 --> 5221.48
foreign

5259.52 --> 5262.52
hmm

5266.4 --> 5269.4
right

5297.679 --> 5300.679
uh

5320.0 --> 5323.0
oh

5326.08 --> 5330.679
okay there one fire unit

5336.639 --> 5340.2390000000005
right

5337.84 --> 5340.2390000000005
anyway

5340.32 --> 5344.36
enough about them seriously

5351.52 --> 5354.52
okay

5373.199 --> 5377.48
certainly seems to be warming up

5404.88 --> 5408.56
communists like booze

5409.36 --> 5416.96
recreational drug soldier yeah

5412.96 --> 5421.199
well that's because it makes you very

5416.96 --> 5425.28
easy to go with and it also especially

5421.199 --> 5427.28
numbs down your moral outrage senses

5425.28 --> 5428.239
right and that's why they like alcohol

5427.28 --> 5430.5599999999995
because

5428.239 --> 5433.599999999999
alcohol will make you just let things

5430.56 --> 5436.400000000001
happen without objection that's why they

5433.6 --> 5436.400000000001
like alcohol

5438.32 --> 5444.599999999999
like if you're drunk you're less likely

5440.4 --> 5444.599999999999
to resist you see

5451.92 --> 5456.4800000000005
and to be fair i actually in a way use

5454.639 --> 5458.8
it a little bit like that because i do

5456.48 --> 5458.799999999999
drink

5460.719 --> 5463.92
and

5461.679 --> 5465.6
it's like that's exactly what it does i

5463.92 --> 5468.719
can handle

5465.6 --> 5470.320000000001
like garbage better and fear porn better

5468.719 --> 5473.12
i can just like

5470.32 --> 5475.5199999999995
let it slip past and without just having

5473.12 --> 5477.44
to like feel like

5475.52 --> 5479.040000000001
right just like

5477.44 --> 5480.879999999999
yeah yeah yeah

5479.04 --> 5483.04
that's kind of what it does to me so

5480.88 --> 5487.6
yeah they're counting on that effect for

5483.04 --> 5489.679
it right that's why they promote alcohol

5487.6 --> 5494.1990000000005
because it makes you tolerant of things

5489.679 --> 5494.1990000000005
that you normally wouldn't tolerate

5528.49 --> 5531.7
[Music]

5531.92 --> 5536.96
i don't know man shouldn't you be just

5533.92 --> 5539.96
more worried about your own

5536.96 --> 5539.96
serious

5556.08 --> 5558.32
like

5558.88 --> 5563.4400000000005
now every time people do this i always

5560.96 --> 5565.199
go like okay so why would you lay that

5563.44 --> 5567.599999999999
those groups and all that and their

5565.199 --> 5569.12
influence why don't you lay that down

5567.6 --> 5571.280000000001
next to

5569.12 --> 5572.88
the western groups

5571.28 --> 5574.719
people that you're

5572.88 --> 5576.88
among

5574.719 --> 5579.28
i think most of you

5576.88 --> 5581.52
why don't you lay out what their

5579.28 --> 5584.5599999999995
influences and weaknesses are and all

5581.52 --> 5586.2390000000005
that [ __ ] right instead of focusing on

5584.56 --> 5589.4800000000005
the other groups that have their own

5586.239 --> 5589.48
thing going

5600.96 --> 5605.84
like i've

5602.8 --> 5608.08
i've never bumped into like a muslim

5605.84 --> 5611.360000000001
person or whatever

5608.08 --> 5613.6
that would act demonic

5611.36 --> 5613.599999999999
right

5614.639 --> 5619.6
they would get maybe harsh

5617.6 --> 5620.8
agitated

5619.6 --> 5623.280000000001
but

5620.8 --> 5624.88
all of them would at least try to act

5623.28 --> 5628.32
with honor

5624.88 --> 5630.400000000001
unless they were well not muslim

5628.32 --> 5632.639
they were kind of like mountain people

5630.4 --> 5636.08
arabs or whatever they're called

5632.639 --> 5637.52
like not really spiritually educated

5636.08 --> 5639.679
right well

5637.52 --> 5642.0
those aren't muslims

5639.679 --> 5644.159
right just like

5642.0 --> 5647.52
because what you're doing is what could

5644.159 --> 5650.5599999999995
be conceived that for example afghan

5647.52 --> 5653.84
people would look at the west let's just

5650.56 --> 5656.4800000000005
say england and then just get some mark

5653.84 --> 5658.0
taylor or whatever

5656.48 --> 5659.759999999999
and then call him like yeah that's a

5658.0 --> 5663.04
christian

5659.76 --> 5665.92
is he now is he christian no

5663.04 --> 5668.48
he's one of those [ __ ] people that's

5665.92 --> 5669.4400000000005
not spiritually educated he's an idiot

5668.48 --> 5670.48
right

5669.44 --> 5673.759999999999
well

5670.48 --> 5676.48
why would you then assume that any arab

5673.76 --> 5680.96
that is kind of a dredge

5676.48 --> 5683.44
or a drink or like blatantly

5680.96 --> 5685.92
not following the islam code

5683.44 --> 5689.44
in their life and their behavior why

5685.92 --> 5691.679
would you call them even a muslim

5689.44 --> 5691.678999999999
right

5691.76 --> 5696.320000000001
because if they were following it

5694.32 --> 5698.48
and that same counts for christians if

5696.32 --> 5700.639
you were actually properly following it

5698.48 --> 5703.44
you'll find that

5700.639 --> 5705.1990000000005
those people are very reasonable

5703.44 --> 5707.28
very wise even

5705.199 --> 5708.48
a lot of them

5707.28 --> 5709.44
and

5708.48 --> 5711.5199999999995
good

5709.44 --> 5715.36
hearted and sensitive

5711.52 --> 5717.4400000000005
to subtle details even right but they're

5715.36 --> 5719.36
those are the spiritually educated the

5717.44 --> 5721.36
ones that take it really serious the one

5719.36 --> 5723.5199999999995
that have a lot of spirit

5721.36 --> 5726.0
not every people

5723.52 --> 5728.159000000001
not all of the people in all those

5726.0 --> 5730.08
countries are like that they have their

5728.159 --> 5732.239
own dredges they have their own mark

5730.08 --> 5733.679
taylor idiots and all that

5732.239 --> 5734.5599999999995
right

5733.679 --> 5736.88
they just

5734.56 --> 5738.080000000001
still kind of look like them just like

5736.88 --> 5739.84
we

5738.08 --> 5742.0
we

5739.84 --> 5745.4400000000005
people in our respective countries to

5742.0 --> 5746.88
them kind of all look alike you see

5745.44 --> 5749.919999999999
don't call

5746.88 --> 5752.400000000001
them muslim unless they actually behave

5749.92 --> 5752.4
muslim

5754.84 --> 5759.4800000000005
anyway

5756.48 --> 5759.48
right

5779.92 --> 5785.4
okay iris airways the titan could be

5799.119 --> 5804.08
wait do i know you your icon seems

5801.84 --> 5806.08
familiar

5804.08 --> 5807.84
did you change your name weren't you

5806.08 --> 5809.28
like aries

5807.84 --> 5812.4400000000005
106

5809.28 --> 5812.44
or something

5825.76 --> 5829.08
i don't know

5843.44 --> 5847.119
okay

5844.8 --> 5848.88
so you're not the guy that has been in

5847.119 --> 5851.839999999999
my chat for

5848.88 --> 5851.84
like three years

5851.92 --> 5856.639
he's also called ares and he also has

5854.48 --> 5858.799999999999
kind of that picture you have so that's

5856.639 --> 5863.08
weird

5858.8 --> 5863.08
i thought it was might have been you

5887.44 --> 5890.44
uh

5899.6 --> 5904.52
oh okay that would explain right

5926.96 --> 5932.0
what do you think that people were ever

5929.52 --> 5933.040000000001
meant to have a worldview

5932.0 --> 5935.6
where to

5933.04 --> 5935.6
nosey

5936.4 --> 5941.599999999999
what what do you mean aisles g i don't

5938.4 --> 5941.599999999999
understand the question

5942.88 --> 5946.84
what do you mean a worldview

5968.719 --> 5971.719
ugh

5982.4 --> 5985.4
hmm

6016.639 --> 6021.28
okay so guys yeah i got 20 more minutes

6021.52 --> 6028.88
what do you would you like me to address

6023.76 --> 6030.719
that is absolutely not related to islam

6028.88 --> 6032.639
that would be great i'm kind of done

6030.719 --> 6035.199
with that for now

6032.639 --> 6036.400000000001
right i specifically started out in

6035.199 --> 6038.48
today's show

6036.4 --> 6042.08
like i don't really want to talk about

6038.48 --> 6044.48
that every freaking person is talking

6042.08 --> 6046.88
about it now i'm kind of sick of it

6044.48 --> 6048.638999999999
right i made the points i

6046.88 --> 6050.639
felt i needed to make

6048.639 --> 6052.8
made them clear

6050.639 --> 6056.88
i don't want to talk about that all day

6052.8 --> 6056.88
i really really don't

6057.119 --> 6060.639
like unless you have something

6059.04 --> 6064.0
interesting

6060.639 --> 6066.639
that is not just related to them warring

6064.0 --> 6070.0
everything right because yeah i get it

6066.639 --> 6070.0
already i'm sick of it

6070.8 --> 6076.400000000001
it's complete straw man to what actually

6074.32 --> 6077.199
triggered all this blabbering and that

6076.4 --> 6078.4
is

6077.199 --> 6082.638999999999
neglect

6078.4 --> 6086.08
on purpose to create drama

6082.639 --> 6087.679
to torture people mentally

6086.08 --> 6090.5599999999995
with imagery

6087.679 --> 6092.96
to try to corral them into doing

6090.56 --> 6095.1990000000005
something again for the government that

6092.96 --> 6098.08
they normally wouldn't

6095.199 --> 6100.0
that's why they do it

6098.08 --> 6104.0
none of it was necessary it could have

6100.0 --> 6106.56
all been prevented not a single person

6104.0 --> 6109.6
would have had to die because of

6106.56 --> 6109.6
everything that's happening

6113.52 --> 6118.8
jordan peterson i don't have too many

6116.0 --> 6118.8
thoughts about him

6119.04 --> 6125.199
i was never really interested

6122.48 --> 6127.04
i do know about him through

6125.199 --> 6130.32
other people

6127.04 --> 6132.88
jim bob does a voice of him constantly

6130.32 --> 6135.44
i know i've heard listen more to jim bob

6132.88 --> 6137.4400000000005
acts like jordan peters and then i've

6135.44 --> 6138.719
actually listened to jordan peterson by

6137.44 --> 6140.96
now

6138.719 --> 6140.96
right

6146.0 --> 6149.84
i don't have too much to say about him

6149.92 --> 6155.04
i think he's a bit of a freak

6153.119 --> 6158.04
ah look who's talking right yeah

6155.04 --> 6158.04
whatever

6167.36 --> 6171.4
ah there you go

6194.8 --> 6199.6
right well and unless return to normal

6197.04 --> 6202.719
we have something specific you would

6199.6 --> 6203.52
like me to reflect upon concerning him

6202.719 --> 6207.28
right

6203.52 --> 6207.280000000001
i just don't really know the guy

6210.96 --> 6215.119
all right that's sailor i'll talk to you

6212.8 --> 6215.119000000001
later

6217.679 --> 6222.88

6225.36 --> 6228.799999999999
you have me on skype good

6229.44 --> 6233.839999999999
i know nothing

6231.119 --> 6233.839999999999
okay

6243.92 --> 6249.6
okay there is the titan

6246.719 --> 6249.6
easy there

6252.88 --> 6257.119
have you watched doobs

6255.76 --> 6259.04
doobs

6257.119 --> 6262.5599999999995
do base

6259.04 --> 6264.719
with an with an a another e but dupes

6262.56 --> 6268.400000000001
that's funny that you call them that

6264.719 --> 6268.4
dupes density video yeah i have

6269.52 --> 6273.280000000001
yeah the bay is definitely now

6273.679 --> 6278.36
in the full understanding of relative

6275.36 --> 6278.36
density

6296.8 --> 6300.4800000000005
well plugged in youtube yeah well

6301.28 --> 6305.36
from what i've gathered

6303.44 --> 6307.839999999999
from other people

6305.36 --> 6309.28
like owen benjamin and and others

6307.84 --> 6311.28
talking about it

6309.28 --> 6314.159
he is like part of

6311.28 --> 6316.719
establishment chill control opposition

6314.159 --> 6319.28
system

6316.719 --> 6320.56
like ben shapiro is

6319.28 --> 6324.239
even more

6320.56 --> 6326.4800000000005
right establishment covert establishment

6324.239 --> 6328.799999999999
controlled opposition supposed to be the

6326.48 --> 6331.36
opposition but actually there to corral

6328.8 --> 6333.1990000000005
you towards it

6331.36 --> 6335.839999999999
towards goals right

6333.199 --> 6340.5599999999995
and jordan peterson or with ben shapiro

6335.84 --> 6342.08
was very clear that he is that like

6340.56 --> 6345.679
but with jordan peterson i don't know

6342.08 --> 6347.28
because they haven't really studied him

6345.679 --> 6351.6
never really listened to him i did

6347.28 --> 6351.599999999999
listen to ben shapiro for a time though

6354.08 --> 6356.32
like

6356.48 --> 6360.5599999999995
a while ago when he kind of came into

6358.8 --> 6362.8
the attention for

6360.56 --> 6365.119000000001
going in open

6362.8 --> 6365.88
podium debates

6365.119 --> 6369.5199999999995
with

6365.88 --> 6369.52
lgbtq and all that

6369.92 --> 6376.2390000000005
like he did do that at first

6372.4 --> 6376.239
and then was kind of halfway interesting

6376.96 --> 6382.0
but then he started to get all like

6379.44 --> 6384.08
warmongering and [ __ ] and it just became

6382.0 --> 6384.84
very blatantly apparent like what he's

6384.08 --> 6388.92
there

6384.84 --> 6388.92
for right

6402.96 --> 6407.52
all right thanks for that double jab

6407.6 --> 6411.76
i guess yeah i have a very good visual

6410.32 --> 6415.08
memory

6411.76 --> 6415.08
that's right

6418.159 --> 6423.679
i scored tens on my spatial awareness

6421.76 --> 6425.52
tests in school

6423.679 --> 6426.96
ten

6425.52 --> 6429.360000000001
it was like the only thing that i

6426.96 --> 6431.44
actually did score tens on

6429.36 --> 6434.32
because i would just master it beyond

6431.44 --> 6434.32
the very test

6439.44 --> 6444.0
do i have a memory palace what

6444.239 --> 6449.919999999999
it's all subconscious that

6447.119 --> 6452.719
it's like a giant image a giant picture

6449.92 --> 6454.4
of all things in one picture

6452.719 --> 6457.119
that's what it is and it's constantly

6454.4 --> 6460.0
growing and refining

6457.119 --> 6461.199
but i don't consciously have it it's not

6460.0 --> 6463.84
like oh

6461.199 --> 6465.759999999999
i'm going to go there no how my memory

6463.84 --> 6468.2390000000005
actually works is kind of tricky but it

6465.76 --> 6470.96
is automated it's just that i don't have

6468.239 --> 6473.44
conscious control over it it's like a

6470.96 --> 6474.96
weird interaction with my subconscious

6473.44 --> 6476.799999999999
it's like

6474.96 --> 6478.4800000000005
a certain setting a program an

6476.8 --> 6481.92
understanding

6478.48 --> 6485.119
we have me and my subconscious

6481.92 --> 6487.4400000000005
i know a little weird

6485.119 --> 6489.839999999999
i just know it's there

6487.44 --> 6491.839999999999
i know i i have all the memories

6489.84 --> 6493.52
everything i've ever seen and experience

6491.84 --> 6495.6
even if i didn't understand it at the

6493.52 --> 6499.119000000001
time if i couldn't handle it everything

6495.6 --> 6501.76
is there i know this

6499.119 --> 6504.5599999999995
it's just that i cannot always actively

6501.76 --> 6508.360000000001
access everything on a whim

6504.56 --> 6508.360000000001
that's not how it works

6513.84 --> 6517.4400000000005
based on a real place you know

6516.4 --> 6520.32
well it's

6517.44 --> 6523.04
it's not represented as a location there

6520.32 --> 6525.679
is no virtual location it's

6523.04 --> 6527.5199999999995
my memory is purely fluid

6525.679 --> 6530.639
in the sense that there is no

6527.52 --> 6533.52
architecture or specific design for it

6530.639 --> 6537.679
it's literally a giant

6533.52 --> 6541.400000000001
interdimensional painting spirit only

6537.679 --> 6541.4
like a giant fractal

6541.679 --> 6546.719
so no it's not represented as the actual

6544.8 --> 6547.92
location

6546.719 --> 6552.04
for me

6547.92 --> 6552.04
as far as i know at least

6564.719 --> 6569.76
and if it is it's a really bizarre

6567.36 --> 6572.32
location

6569.76 --> 6575.84
like if i have a memory palace that is

6572.32 --> 6578.239
i've heard of that before as a reference

6575.84 --> 6579.52
where did i get it like the secret place

6578.239 --> 6581.678999999999
and then you get in there and it looks

6579.52 --> 6583.4400000000005
like a giant library what is that movie

6581.679 --> 6585.1990000000005
again

6583.44 --> 6587.28
don't remember

6585.199 --> 6589.919999999999
but if i have anything like that then it

6587.28 --> 6593.36
doesn't look like a classic library it

6589.92 --> 6597.76
it it was probably more like a

6593.36 --> 6600.0
secret super high-tech digital bunker

6597.76 --> 6602.56
with like holographic computer

6600.0 --> 6606.239
interfaces and [ __ ]

6602.56 --> 6608.639
and just interactive stat rollouts it's

6606.239 --> 6610.48
very different

6608.639 --> 6612.96
from just a library

6610.48 --> 6613.839999999999
with a whole bunch of drawers with books

6612.96 --> 6615.36
in them

6613.84 --> 6618.0
very differently

6615.36 --> 6618.0
represented

6619.36 --> 6623.839999999999
no no

6621.119 --> 6626.48
organized memory excuse me do i have

6623.84 --> 6629.119000000001
memory problems

6626.48 --> 6631.44
do i people do i like i know there are

6629.119 --> 6632.96
things like blotted out

6631.44 --> 6635.28
well they're blotted out for a good

6632.96 --> 6638.28
reason i bet

6635.28 --> 6638.28
right

6638.639 --> 6642.0
i think

6640.32 --> 6644.4
but things have been restoring to me

6642.0 --> 6646.719
it's just that

6644.4 --> 6649.679
the whole problem with my memory and

6646.719 --> 6651.44
like the amnesia from trauma

6649.679 --> 6653.04
the whole problem was that i never was

6651.44 --> 6655.5199999999995
able to handle it in the first place

6653.04 --> 6657.44
that's why it became like that

6655.52 --> 6659.76
it just requires time i don't need

6657.44 --> 6663.598999999999
assistance at it it's all working out it

6659.76 --> 6663.599
has been for years now

6663.679 --> 6669.84
literally people have seen me transform

6667.199 --> 6672.799999999999
the way i act the way i think

6669.84 --> 6674.159000000001
my confidence levels it's all

6672.8 --> 6677.04
visually

6674.159 --> 6680.638999999999
been changing to everybody that's

6677.04 --> 6683.36
followed my channel

6680.639 --> 6686.88
i don't need assistance or techniques

6683.36 --> 6689.44
for my memory my memory works exactly as

6686.88 --> 6691.52
well as it should

6689.44 --> 6694.5199999999995
not nothing better nothing

6691.52 --> 6694.52
worse

6700.85 --> 6703.929
[Music]

6710.159 --> 6715.679
right surface learning well i do that

6713.44 --> 6717.199
that's the cool thing about it

6715.679 --> 6719.84
i can

6717.199 --> 6721.36
understand things before i know what

6719.84 --> 6722.96
they are

6721.36 --> 6725.839999999999
very good at it

6722.96 --> 6728.719
i've trained this my entire life

6725.84 --> 6731.599
obsessed over the ability to do that

6728.719 --> 6733.36
obsessed over it from a very young age

6731.599 --> 6735.4400000000005
on

6733.36 --> 6737.199
and have become a whole lot better at it

6735.44 --> 6738.879999999999
because you do get things wrong

6737.199 --> 6740.799999999999
especially when you

6738.88 --> 6742.8
yeah in my youth i got a lot of things

6740.8 --> 6745.1990000000005
wrong

6742.8 --> 6749.76
right because it does not provide

6745.199 --> 6752.879999999999
prevent you from actually by taking bait

6749.76 --> 6752.88
with illusions

6753.199 --> 6757.678999999999
doesn't prevent that

6755.199 --> 6760.96
but it can help you fill in that which

6757.679 --> 6764.599
you have no nothing to fill it in with

6760.96 --> 6764.599
it's pretty amazing

6788.8 --> 6793.04
what do you mean steamy traveler do i

6790.88 --> 6796.2390000000005
see any changes in myself that are

6793.04 --> 6799.199
starting to formulate

6796.239 --> 6799.199
what what do you mean

6803.36 --> 6807.839999999999
i think i pretty much summed it up

6812.639 --> 6816.400000000001
right

6813.76 --> 6818.56
look true knowledge

6816.4 --> 6821.839999999999
is not about knowing everything it's

6818.56 --> 6824.8
about knowing every or as much as you

6821.84 --> 6825.84
can handle

6824.8 --> 6827.599
right

6825.84 --> 6829.4400000000005
people like to forget about that they

6827.599 --> 6831.599
just think that you're just a computer

6829.44 --> 6833.598999999999
and you just upload your hard disk with

6831.599 --> 6835.599
everything or something no

6833.599 --> 6837.92
no it's all about

6835.599 --> 6840.639
how much can your conscience actually

6837.92 --> 6840.639
handle of it

6841.199 --> 6845.36
that's where the real power comes from

6843.119 --> 6847.199
from the conjunction

6845.36 --> 6850.639
of the consciousness

6847.199 --> 6854.159
with the information not just absorbing

6850.639 --> 6855.84
information if you don't consciously

6854.159 --> 6858.32
entangle with it

6855.84 --> 6860.2390000000005
because you can't handle it then you

6858.32 --> 6862.719
can't really know it

6860.239 --> 6866.08
you will have it in you but you cannot

6862.719 --> 6868.2390000000005
then handle it because it's incompatible

6866.08 --> 6870.4
you have to actually

6868.239 --> 6874.839999999999
be able to handle it and assimilate it

6870.4 --> 6874.839999999999
before you can master it

6904.639 --> 6908.719
hmm okay erase the titan that's good way

6907.28 --> 6910.8
to say it

6908.719 --> 6914.0
only way to access is meditation i

6910.8 --> 6914.0
disagree with that though

6915.76 --> 6920.320000000001
why would you access it in the first

6918.0 --> 6920.32
place

6922.56 --> 6929.04
right if you're supposed to have it

6925.52 --> 6929.040000000001
available to you

6930.239 --> 6935.839999999999
then why wouldn't it become available to

6933.679 --> 6937.4400000000005
you right

6935.84 --> 6940.0
because you're supposed to have it

6937.44 --> 6940.96
available to you

6940.0 --> 6943.28
just

6940.96 --> 6945.84
why don't you instead

6943.28 --> 6947.92
instead of being a control freak about

6945.84 --> 6951.719
your subconscious mechanics

6947.92 --> 6954.8
why don't you trust gain a trust

6951.719 --> 6957.36
relationship with your subconscious

6954.8 --> 6960.719
understand how it works

6957.36 --> 6963.28
and feel it out how it works and then

6960.719 --> 6965.36
try to get an understanding it's like

6963.28 --> 6967.199
trying to communicate and get an

6965.36 --> 6969.119
understanding with a ghost except the

6967.199 --> 6972.96
ghost is you

6969.119 --> 6972.96
on the other side inside

6973.36 --> 6980.639
right i'm not gonna try to pry things

6976.8 --> 6982.88
from my subconscious no i trust

6980.639 --> 6987.400000000001
everything i need will be delivered to

6982.88 --> 6987.400000000001

7000.56 --> 7005.52
don't force your way through push aside

7003.599 --> 7007.4400000000005
things because you don't understand

7005.52 --> 7008.4800000000005
because you don't want to deal with it

7007.44 --> 7010.48
no

7008.48 --> 7014.4
learn it

7010.48 --> 7018.718999999999
find a way through don't push it aside

7014.4 --> 7018.719
know what it is how it really is

7026.48 --> 7029.48
right

7036.0 --> 7041.44
and yeah when the time is right for deep

7039.119 --> 7042.639
memory to surface because it's called

7041.44 --> 7044.879999999999
for because the all the right

7042.639 --> 7046.4800000000005
frequencies are there and you can handle

7044.88 --> 7049.1990000000005
that level

7046.48 --> 7052.638999999999
that energy those frequencies then the

7049.199 --> 7055.28
memory will simply reveal itself

7052.639 --> 7057.4400000000005
and i don't need to meditate for that

7055.28 --> 7059.92
you just have to be attuned right

7057.44 --> 7062.5599999999995
meditation is really to get yourself to

7059.92 --> 7062.56
a tune

7063.52 --> 7067.1990000000005
i don't have to engage in an action to

7066.08 --> 7069.199
