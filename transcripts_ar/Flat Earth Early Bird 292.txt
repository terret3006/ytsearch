[Music]

38.21 --> 45.78
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.0 --> 47.43
early-bird number 292 I'm your host

45.78 --> 49.08
Arwen and before we start the show

47.43 --> 50.97

65.369 --> 72.15
super chat if there's no other way much

68.4 --> 74.58000000000001
appreciate it if you do so yeah sorry

72.15 --> 78.02000000000001
for being a little bit late it's busy on

74.58 --> 81.36
the drawing anyway the weather today is

78.02 --> 84.479
quite astonishingly beautiful at this

81.36 --> 89.39
moment at least not really seen any

84.479 --> 89.39
chemtrails hasn't even rained really but

91.28 --> 97.17
think cloud some of them might have been

94.47 --> 103.61
artificially induced especially up there

97.17 --> 103.61
in the distance but just amazing sites

108.189 --> 113.64999999999999
yeah

109.7 --> 120.08
and it's nice and warm but not too warm

113.65 --> 121.10000000000001
it's a really beautiful day outside so I

120.08 --> 130.899
got with me

121.1 --> 130.899
no edibles tea Tamara coffee that's it

131.77 --> 144.31900000000002
so yeah yesterday was sounds kind of

136.04 --> 147.89
weird but it was the first time two or

144.319 --> 151.57999999999998
three months that I didn't drink any

147.89 --> 160.67
kind of alcohol of any sort in an entire

151.58 --> 163.519
day and was a good decision because yeah

160.67 --> 166.7
the weird thing was I didn't even have

163.519 --> 171.16
any proper dinner and I don't miss it so

166.7 --> 173.98899999999998
whatever was going on I think that the

171.16 --> 177.23
continued burden of the Elco I guess

173.989 --> 181.549
from a daily exposure has caused a

177.23 --> 185.29899999999998
certain metabolic burning need

181.549 --> 188.48000000000002
constantly for extra food and now that I

185.299 --> 190.25
stopped suddenly that dropped away so

188.48 --> 191.61999999999998
there was kind of like a sigh of relief

190.25 --> 195.89
I guess

191.62 --> 200.66
and it's better and I think I'm gonna

195.89 --> 201.80999999999997
keep it like this oh God

200.66 --> 205.84
[Music]

201.81 --> 206.71
did he now Ragnar Stefan hey listen yeah

205.84 --> 210.46
anyway

206.71 --> 214.84
good morning let's see who is in chat

210.46 --> 216.12
today a stone monkey 3d HM Amanda young

214.84 --> 219.34
and amis Kang

216.12 --> 225.73000000000002
Ragnar Stefan Alice and then the band

219.34 --> 231.91
saw bended Steve and gosh stand back a

225.73 --> 238.51
good servant your David reads

231.91 --> 241.42
Lou and God I wear what happened now

238.51 --> 244.92999999999998
look I went to bed very early well very

241.42 --> 250.02999999999997
one o'clock yeah I've actually been up

244.93 --> 253.69
watching Game of Thrones a lot I still

250.03 --> 257.65
left one episode there are only six

253.69 --> 261.34
right in the last season anyway yeah

257.65 --> 264.31
that was interesting not super

261.34 --> 265.65999999999997
interesting or at least yeah I guess

264.31 --> 267.49
there were disappointments but it's

265.66 --> 269.91
bound to happen the whole thing is so

267.49 --> 269.91
much momentum

275.83 --> 278.58
yeah

282.59 --> 295.27
anyway II let's get back to Chet I did

288.02 --> 295.27
that the Game of Thrones series okay

296.5 --> 311.419
right well it is a it is a very properly

304.669 --> 317.27
executed series with fantastic visuals

311.419 --> 322.15999999999997
great choreography and very good actors

317.27 --> 324.56
and a good story just I don't know it's

322.16 --> 329.66
like they roll the natural 20 on this

324.56 --> 332.03000000000003
one and hey even other types of stories

329.66 --> 334.31
and movies from that could have been

332.03 --> 339.169
also extremely good but this yeah it is

334.31 --> 345.229
really good but for me personally I take

339.169 --> 347.96
it as look this is you can take that it

345.229 --> 353.78
really does has to have a certain system

347.96 --> 357.89
and you can you can try things out with

353.78 --> 359.92999999999995
that and adapt partially set it for a

357.89 --> 361.82
certain phase or a certain there's all

359.93 --> 365.78000000000003
kinds of things you can so it's just

361.82 --> 371.27
more knowledge of stories of very

365.78 --> 373.58
interesting conquest related stories so

371.27 --> 376.18
I [ __ ] this is but well there's all

373.58 --> 381.15999999999997
these series out there so many things

376.18 --> 385.94
and Breaking Bad is is it's a really

381.16 --> 388.78900000000004
tense like the whole criminal and the

385.94 --> 390.68
power of secrecy and all that and it is

388.789 --> 394.55
pretty dark though it is really a

390.68 --> 397.039
terrible example if you ask me it will

394.55 --> 402.139
encourage just devious people to like

397.039 --> 405.169
maybe I could kind of or somehow it's it

402.139 --> 409.03000000000003
is not a good thing to be out there but

405.169 --> 414.77
as a series yes it was extremely

409.03 --> 419.81899999999996
fascinating and and like they really

414.77 --> 422.75899999999996
they really roughed you up with the

419.819 --> 427.86
brutal honesty of things and that made

422.759 --> 431.129
it kind of that was yeah that was a good

427.86 --> 432.36
twist to the whole thing so I like that

431.129 --> 434.61
about Breaking Bad

432.36 --> 439.099
but it's not a series I'd like to see

434.61 --> 439.099
regularly no not really

439.279 --> 446.519
you'd have to forget long enough all the

443.909 --> 450.11899999999997
terrible [ __ ] that happened and how ya

446.519 --> 451.67900000000003
disgusting it really was in order to be

450.119 --> 453.24
lured in like oh yeah it was a really

451.679 --> 456.179
good series let's see that again then

453.24 --> 459.809
you're like ah [ __ ] I forgot about that

456.179 --> 463.289
part oh so it's that kind of a series

459.809 --> 464.90900000000005
it's not really for me not anymore

463.289 --> 467.759
I guess twenty years ago I would have

464.909 --> 472.8
loved that [ __ ] now not so much anymore

467.759 --> 477.599
it's just not healthy Vikings I've seen

472.8 --> 482.399
part of Vikings it yeah it is it is

477.599 --> 486.959
really kind of disgusting too in many

482.399 --> 489.619
ways it is about the whole Viking things

486.959 --> 492.479
is really about breaking the mind and

489.619 --> 496.639
spellbinding people it is it is pretty

492.479 --> 496.639
freakin wrong if you ask me it's

500.73 --> 506.07
but yes it is also fascinating as well

504.23 --> 508.47
but I don't like it

506.07 --> 512.7
really it's fascinating in the bad way

508.47 --> 517.5
like don't underestimate all these

512.7 --> 524.61
series what they do with you with your

517.5 --> 527.39
mind and with your soul as you and as

524.61 --> 527.39
you delve in

530.0 --> 535.22
yeah

532.19 --> 540.0500000000001
anyway I don't like all that stuff so

535.22 --> 543.25
much it's it's just not healthy for me

540.05 --> 543.25
[Music]

550.149 --> 556.76
anyway let's stop get back to flatter

553.13 --> 559.1899999999999
somebody asked about George doing

556.76 --> 564.2
another coriolis explanation where was

559.19 --> 566.44
that Ragnar Stefan he'll listen you

564.2 --> 566.44
asked

587.83 --> 596.44
all right right yeah no that was after I

592.42 --> 602.38
went to bed I think ordering I have no

596.44 --> 604.0
idea what happened I've been watching a

602.38 --> 608.29
lot of yeah I've been catching up on

604.0 --> 610.62
Owen Benjamin so which was pretty pretty

608.29 --> 610.62
cool

617.45 --> 623.7
so I take it George just did the same

621.81 --> 626.7299999999999
[ __ ] over and over again maybe with a

623.7 --> 629.94
slightly new polish this time because

626.73 --> 633.44
that's what George has been doing he's

629.94 --> 633.44
like a broken record it seems

639.16 --> 645.24
[Music]

649.61 --> 665.779
okay do I have to watch it really like I

660.36 --> 665.779
already sat through one what was it

669.829 --> 675.319
I said Bob lobsters or wasn't on rent

672.41 --> 677.54
ease I don't remember where yeah I

675.319 --> 685.3389999999999
wasn't randy's I think where Nathan was

677.54 --> 687.3499999999999
just literally yelling George for almost

685.339 --> 690.139
an hour and and he started shaving

687.35 --> 694.389
himself I was there was freaking

690.139 --> 694.389
hilarious but

697.02 --> 701.81
yes like I'm kind of done with that

706.04 --> 713.67
ahead of bear says George is secretly a

710.52 --> 721.1
small hat well I certainly did get the

713.67 --> 721.0999999999999
thought as well but on the other hand I

724.64 --> 729.87
don't know

726.62 --> 733.59
yeah Gideon sick I know it'll probably

729.87 --> 737.07
just irritate me because George just

733.59 --> 739.14
refuses to listen just keep on trying

737.07 --> 743.61
today no you do this didn't understand

739.14 --> 745.17
he just a the whole gaslighting [ __ ]

743.61 --> 746.52
like we're the ones that not

745.17 --> 748.5899999999999
understanding and while we are

746.52 --> 753.63
explaining every detail about it to him

748.59 --> 756.44
and it's kind of the same old same old

753.63 --> 759.66
just like what Brenda does eventually

756.44 --> 763.08
but I don't know for some reason he's

759.66 --> 764.9399999999999
like staying in there to keep that

763.08 --> 767.97
pressure for some reason like there's

764.94 --> 771.09
like oh we need to be upholding the

767.97 --> 774.33
shield against the dragon's breath I is

771.09 --> 776.34
that I wonder sometimes is that what

774.33 --> 779.01
they're visualizing is there like now I

776.34 --> 781.1700000000001
have to stay in there while yeah you're

779.01 --> 784.53
getting skull that made lo look like a

781.17 --> 788.0999999999999
total freaking [ __ ] to everything you

784.53 --> 791.04
say and they just no no I have to hole

788.1 --> 796.73
it all the line we can't give them

791.04 --> 800.39
another inch yeah it's so weird

796.73 --> 800.39
do you know what I mean

803.93 --> 811.6999999999999
they don't walk away that they really

806.81 --> 818.529
should really George no what are you

811.7 --> 818.529
saying really are you sure about that

831.29 --> 837.5899999999999
so what is he saying then you tell me if

835.4 --> 843.55
you're so sure he knows what he's saying

837.59 --> 843.5500000000001
then so tell me what he's saying

849.139 --> 855.9590000000001
can I point at anything he says wrong

852.299 --> 859.519
well let me think oh wait yeah the same

855.959 --> 863.1189999999999
[ __ ] over and over again how about

859.519 --> 867.829
there's either Coriolis effect on

863.119 --> 871.759
everything within a certain space and

867.829 --> 874.649
then at some point there are whatever

871.759 --> 876.929
sorry I'm switching it around so if the

874.649 --> 881.429
air layer is stationary with rotating

876.929 --> 884.879
with the earth then there's not gonna be

881.429 --> 889.29
any Coriolis effect because there's

884.879 --> 894.389
nothing to make it deviate everything is

889.29 --> 899.009
just like it you know Coriolis deviation

894.389 --> 901.47
other reference frames is about the

899.009 --> 905.519
orientation of the material of the

901.47 --> 909.389
medium therein that's the air you know

905.519 --> 911.699
and yeah you could reasoner all once the

909.389 --> 913.559
supposed vacuum that somehow there are

911.699 --> 915.389
second law of thermodynamics relation

913.559 --> 917.85
just there and a bullet or something

915.389 --> 920.519
else or rocket whatever is going to go

917.85 --> 922.889
in there then suddenly it's no longer

920.519 --> 925.139
gonna be pushed around in the reference

922.889 --> 926.129
frame of the earth and then gonna leave

925.139 --> 929.04
it well goody

926.129 --> 931.889
so that's very nice so outside of in

929.04 --> 934.6189999999999
vacuum would ya you would see the

931.889 --> 937.559
courrier that's very nice if you would

934.619 --> 941.5790000000001
presuppose all that but that means that

937.559 --> 943.529
anything within the atmosphere where the

941.579 --> 945.779
air is going to be pushing succinctly

943.529 --> 947.429
with the rotation of the earth there is

945.779 --> 950.389
not going to be a Coriolis effect you

947.429 --> 952.41
can have both a Coriolis effect on

950.389 --> 954.569
something because of a different

952.41 --> 957.7199999999999
reference frame of the earth and not

954.569 --> 960.449
have it within the same medium doesn't

957.72 --> 962.929
make any damn sense you can't have your

960.449 --> 967.7589999999999
Coriolis and eat it too

962.929 --> 967.759
you know the [ __ ] sake

970.0 --> 973.23
[Music]

981.34 --> 987.5600000000001
we're talking about the deflection the

984.92 --> 990.16
Coriolis deflection that's what we were

987.56 --> 990.16
talking about

1018.13 --> 1024.79
yeah reckoner Stefano this is gonna piss

1020.8 --> 1028.78
me off isn't it are you are you just

1024.79 --> 1034.5
trolling me now are you even the same

1028.78 --> 1038.709
person as I remember because I just

1034.5 --> 1044.97
don't like your attitude in the last few

1038.709 --> 1044.97
weeks it's just weird

1062.74 --> 1070.419
yes I know sir shekel it's been that for

1066.64 --> 1072.7
a long time but yeah they get bored of

1070.419 --> 1075.3400000000001
it or they get saturated or they move to

1072.7 --> 1077.1100000000001
something else and what they always do

1075.34 --> 1082.4089999999999
come back when they get the opportunity

1077.11 --> 1085.75
and just make new socks right yeah well

1082.409 --> 1090.3090000000002
if you're looking for the truth let's

1085.75 --> 1098.11
start with this realm not being in outer

1090.309 --> 1102.279
space let's start with that also that

1098.11 --> 1105.039
gravity doesn't exist nobody even knows

1102.279 --> 1109.6
what gravity really is because it's

1105.039 --> 1114.669
fictional it was conceptual an idea that

1109.6 --> 1117.1
never really left the conceptual realm

1114.669 --> 1123.039
not really there's been tricksters to

1117.1 --> 1124.809
try and conjure it up but yeah every

1123.039 --> 1128.649
attempt you know it the same thing

1124.809 --> 1131.97
happens over and over again there's more

1128.649 --> 1131.9699999999998
solid explanations

1139.36 --> 1141.9599999999998
yeah

1142.1 --> 1149.09
the let let us do start with what we can

1146.03 --> 1152.3899999999999
observe straight lines of sight at very

1149.09 --> 1155.6899999999998
low observation height into vast vast

1152.39 --> 1159.89
distances and at the point you do

1155.69 --> 1163.31
eventually start to see things go behind

1159.89 --> 1165.44
the horizon as you would assume it start

1163.31 --> 1168.59
to notice if you had a really good sight

1165.44 --> 1173.18
on it that overall if there are things

1168.59 --> 1175.73
even in the distance that yeah they will

1173.18 --> 1178.13
still be visible but they will be

1175.73 --> 1181.22
partially concealed depending on how

1178.13 --> 1185.72
high it is versus how far away it is so

1181.22 --> 1187.73
there is roughly deducible it's very

1185.72 --> 1189.83
tough to completely get this right

1187.73 --> 1195.5
because also the weather conditions to

1189.83 --> 1201.26
kind of change how heavy the concealment

1195.5 --> 1204.13
that happens does how much it is but

1201.26 --> 1208.43
you'll notice that the concealment rate

1204.13 --> 1211.5800000000002
after the optical slant point where the

1208.43 --> 1213.95
apparent horizon is visible that the

1211.58 --> 1219.6799999999998
consumer rate beyond that into the

1213.95 --> 1222.47
distance of objects is linear every time

1219.68 --> 1224.48
there is no cumulative rate there is no

1222.47 --> 1228.6200000000001
point where certainly a large object

1224.48 --> 1233.1200000000001
just as large as something else will

1228.62 --> 1235.4599999999998
suddenly drop away really heavy well

1233.12 --> 1238.33
it's not that much further away that

1235.46 --> 1241.88
doesn't happen ever

1238.33 --> 1245.4199999999998
so yeah there we're going with that yeah

1241.88 --> 1249.23
all back to Coriolis Oh acceleration

1245.42 --> 1253.5800000000002
rate oh yeah acceleration yeah that's

1249.23 --> 1256.28
really nice so yeah that means there is

1253.58 --> 1258.32
a force there yeah I know you know that

1256.28 --> 1260.0
gravity officially is not a force you

1258.32 --> 1262.22
know that right that's your problem

1260.0 --> 1264.35
well I have an explanation for as to

1262.22 --> 1268.03
what that that acceleration rate

1264.35 --> 1272.2099999999998
actually stands for it's called relative

1268.03 --> 1275.75
density in this equilibrium or well

1272.21 --> 1279.1290000000001
differential you could say so force

1275.75 --> 1282.139
comes into being when there is a higher

1279.129 --> 1285.649
differential between an object and the

1282.139 --> 1288.4399999999998
density it is in or even a fluid if it

1285.649 --> 1290.1789999999999
is released or anything and always works

1288.44 --> 1292.49
it starts to accelerate if it has free

1290.179 --> 1294.74
motion and then something is in its way

1292.49 --> 1296.72
it will stay there it will be stuck

1294.74 --> 1299.33
perhaps or it will slip through does

1296.72 --> 1302.799
matters on the nature is it solid will

1299.33 --> 1305.48
be stuck more easily and then instead of

1302.799 --> 1307.309
being able to move towards its

1305.48 --> 1309.1390000000001
equilibrium points where the

1307.309 --> 1313.25
differential with the surroundings is

1309.139 --> 1316.789
zero it will instead start to exert

1313.25 --> 1320.139
pressure locally towards the direction

1316.789 --> 1323.33
where its equilibrium will be and that

1320.139 --> 1325.6999999999998
is all the forces there it's a full

1323.33 --> 1331.009
explanation based on scientifically

1325.7 --> 1333.8890000000001
provable theories and you have nothing

1331.009 --> 1335.99
you don't even know what gravity is you

1333.889 --> 1338.299
don't even know what it is bending of

1335.99 --> 1341.1200000000001
space-time what does that do nothing it

1338.299 --> 1343.46
doesn't do anything you don't even know

1341.12 --> 1344.9899999999998
what it does it's just imagination you

1343.46 --> 1349.6000000000001
don't even know where it ties in to

1344.99 --> 1352.6
reality it isn't anything it's fictional

1349.6 --> 1352.6
okay

1360.43 --> 1367.22
well sir check oh I could say that it

1364.46 --> 1368.96
can be done with math that's fine but

1367.22 --> 1373.66
indeed you do not need it for the

1368.96 --> 1373.66
scientific method you don't need math

1374.03 --> 1377.079
[Music]

1377.11 --> 1382.9699999999998
scientific method basically deals very

1379.94 --> 1388.55
much like very basic programming that I

1382.97 --> 1395.15
learned it's just if greater lesser it's

1388.55 --> 1398.84
just that kind of basic changes applied

1395.15 --> 1401.99
to something to matter something that is

1398.84 --> 1404.8999999999999
tangible or an observation or whatever

1401.99 --> 1407.48
the medium condition is and it works out

1404.9 --> 1411.2
you don't really need math you could use

1407.48 --> 1414.08
it but the math is more like the nature

1411.2 --> 1415.91
of the structure ization it's not really

1414.08 --> 1422.75
what that is the scientific method is

1415.91 --> 1427.7
just it deals in things it is described

1422.75 --> 1429.97
in words not in mathematics that is its

1427.7 --> 1429.97
origin

1432.13 --> 1437.92
[Music]

1433.33 --> 1437.9199999999998
yeah you're relatively banned

1446.58 --> 1452.9299999999998
you don't have to call it gravity you

1449.52 --> 1452.93
don't even know what gravity is

1454.1 --> 1460.85
you know gravity's a myth

1466.46 --> 1472.3400000000001
leave that that is so funny this comment

1469.25 --> 1482.0
just want to leave that there it's

1472.34 --> 1484.8799999999999
amazing yeah oh this may be easier using

1482.0 --> 1489.26
communications for math all excel sorry

1484.88 --> 1493.6000000000001
I am NOT PC towards math holics I'm

1489.26 --> 1497.45
sorry you're gonna have to learn to

1493.6 --> 1501.11
understand actual language okay I'm not

1497.45 --> 1502.24
going to migrate to to math land if you

1501.11 --> 1507.77
know what I mean

1502.24 --> 1512.08
thank you very much I'll at occasions be

1507.77 --> 1512.08
able to deal with it if I feel like it

1512.86 --> 1519.6789999999999
but yeah I've had my own time in the

1517.309 --> 1522.8
very far past where I kind of was a math

1519.679 --> 1525.8500000000001
Ajala it was very young and it was bad

1522.8 --> 1530.87
for me it wasn't good

1525.85 --> 1533.0
it made me avoid social things very but

1530.87 --> 1539.1499999999999
I escaped in that [ __ ] I'm not gonna go

1533.0 --> 1543.59
there I just don't like it anymore and I

1539.15 --> 1546.6200000000001
don't need it it doesn't really help

1543.59 --> 1549.08
your thinking you know it's one of the

1546.62 --> 1549.7099999999998
myths about math and this is serious

1549.08 --> 1552.4399999999998
okay

1549.71 --> 1554.78
no not math allergic I just don't like

1552.44 --> 1557.39
it anymore I can't understand math I can

1554.78 --> 1562.67
understand it I just don't like doing

1557.39 --> 1564.5900000000001
that especially if it's very complicated

1562.67 --> 1566.66
where you need to learn all kinds of

1564.59 --> 1569.6
tricks all these math tricks because

1566.66 --> 1572.0
what mathematicians originally think and

1569.6 --> 1573.559
what I thought is that when you deal

1572.0 --> 1576.59
with math you're always so active with

1573.559 --> 1580.6
your mind you become smarter right

1576.59 --> 1584.03
that's not true you do become active

1580.6 --> 1585.62
that's right and if you're active just

1584.03 --> 1589.72
like when you constantly train your

1585.62 --> 1592.4899999999998
muscles you will be able to

1589.72 --> 1595.28
well--perhaps carry something heavier

1592.49 --> 1598.85
then if you wouldn't have without having

1595.28 --> 1600.3
any kind of problems or whatever yeah so

1598.85 --> 1604.1399999999999
that is basically the method

1600.3 --> 1606.03
by which they think that by being really

1604.14 --> 1610.0500000000002
good in math you become smart it's not

1606.03 --> 1615.08
true this is a myth it's a lie it's like

1610.05 --> 1619.98
an addict's lie it is because when you

1615.08 --> 1622.52
drown in math it's so different it it is

1619.98 --> 1626.1
so raw rough arsh

1622.52 --> 1629.61
just plain and clear they like it no

1626.1 --> 1634.5
confusions no gray areas except maybe in

1629.61 --> 1638.7299999999998
quantum math or whatever that you they

1634.5 --> 1640.89
don't need to use certain regions of

1638.73 --> 1644.46
their conscious and their feelings

1640.89 --> 1648.0900000000001
mostly so it helps you then it gives an

1644.46 --> 1651.1200000000001
opportunity to escape your feelings as

1648.09 --> 1652.98
you drown in the math and avoid just

1651.12 --> 1655.56
think you can you don't really know how

1652.98 --> 1658.2
to deal with and a lot of people that

1655.56 --> 1660.21
big into math as they're younger they

1658.2 --> 1662.55
think oh my god I finally found it this

1660.21 --> 1667.08
is the magic wand while the one comes

1662.55 --> 1669.96
with a price that is escapism into that

1667.08 --> 1671.79
math and you'll start to dislike people

1669.96 --> 1676.53
that are not good at math and all that

1671.79 --> 1678.6
that happens you have to understand it

1676.53 --> 1681.45
doesn't make you smarter it just makes

1678.6 --> 1685.11
you really good at math that's what it

1681.45 --> 1688.26
does and math is it's like a crystal it

1685.11 --> 1690.06
so it's this very rigid specific pattern

1688.26 --> 1695.25
that's very clear it's always crystal

1690.06 --> 1698.61
clear but feelings and the world out

1695.25 --> 1702.42
there in the spirit and creation it is

1698.61 --> 1704.61
not that it is not like that it is not

1702.42 --> 1708.5600000000002
that structure it is not that crystal

1704.61 --> 1713.06
clear it's much more multi-dimensional

1708.56 --> 1715.77
it's so much more complex than just that

1713.06 --> 1718.98
so it is like an addiction to

1715.77 --> 1723.47
intellectual simplicity that is what

1718.98 --> 1723.47
master Holly ism is and it's real

1724.04 --> 1730.67
I hope you understand this everyone that

1727.64 --> 1733.7900000000002
may be thinking oh my god this guy is

1730.67 --> 1737.24
this guy's really attacking math oh my

1733.79 --> 1741.11
god this is totally insane no no I used

1737.24 --> 1745.43
to be one of you guys okay but I gave it

1741.11 --> 1748.4299999999998
up because it trapped me it made me hang

1745.43 --> 1751.94
around with really annoying people that

1748.43 --> 1757.3400000000001
were really smart but always had moral

1751.94 --> 1759.77
issues or social issues or like bad

1757.34 --> 1764.4399999999998
feelings towards themselves I had that

1759.77 --> 1770.51
too and was very tough to deal with and

1764.44 --> 1773.48
I managed to outgrow it I worked on the

1770.51 --> 1776.57
feelings I stopped escaping into

1773.48 --> 1778.94
whatever into intellectual things even

1776.57 --> 1781.07
into fantasy and games I did that also

1778.94 --> 1786.17
you know you spend a lot of time

1781.07 --> 1787.99
escaping and stuff if you have feelings

1786.17 --> 1795.2
issues with yourself

1787.99 --> 1798.83
and yeah that feeds into well other yeah

1795.2 --> 1800.78
if you if you break the spell if you

1798.83 --> 1804.6499999999999
just work on what you're trying to

1800.78 --> 1807.71
escape from you know you might never be

1804.65 --> 1810.23
able to fix it because whatever you're

1807.71 --> 1812.1200000000001
conceiving is something you've never

1810.23 --> 1815.24
experienced you think that that is it

1812.12 --> 1817.3999999999999
but it's not about reaching that

1815.24 --> 1819.83
perfection or that thing you lost it's

1817.4 --> 1822.14
about building it and new things will

1819.83 --> 1824.1799999999998
come out of it that you didn't foresee

1822.14 --> 1828.2
because you couldn't because you didn't

1824.18 --> 1831.0800000000002
have it I couldn't see it yet from your

1828.2 --> 1837.41
own personal interactions and math ilysm

1831.08 --> 1839.48
is it gets in the way of that it does

1837.41 --> 1842.2900000000002
for every single one of those people

1839.48 --> 1842.29
that have it

1843.83 --> 1849.0
it's weird because it is there's other

1847.74 --> 1851.61
photos of it as well

1849.0 --> 1857.429
people that for example are addicted to

1851.61 --> 1862.649
gematria it is it is system code

1857.429 --> 1864.8990000000001
addiction in way but math is is yeah

1862.649 --> 1868.83
it's the grand jewel of it because it is

1864.899 --> 1878.389
so mighty so fast you have so much room

1868.83 --> 1878.389
to to do things with and all of them all

1878.45 --> 1884.309
distract the one that delve into it

1881.49 --> 1886.799
distract with a false sense of control

1884.309 --> 1888.99
like you get it because you understand

1886.799 --> 1891.6589999999999
the structure you're working with but at

1888.99 --> 1893.879
the same time you're missing a lot of

1891.659 --> 1895.46
points that you could have learned if

1893.879 --> 1898.529
you weren't distracted by it

1895.46 --> 1902.99
it is terrible realization once you

1898.529 --> 1902.99
awaken to that I did it's horrifying

1903.23 --> 1912.1490000000001
but you got to move on and you know even

1908.009 --> 1915.6
if you give it up that doesn't mean you

1912.149 --> 1916.32
certainly get 2.0 I don't understand it

1915.6 --> 1920.309
anymore

1916.32 --> 1921.9289999999999
no that doesn't happen you will figure

1920.309 --> 1923.82
things out once you understand what

1921.929 --> 1926.22
symbols or whatever standing for

1923.82 --> 1928.1589999999999
especially if you were really fanatical

1926.22 --> 1934.409
at it you'll never lose that

1928.159 --> 1936.8400000000001
but yeah you'll just not think

1934.409 --> 1939.8400000000001
eventually it'll be worth the investment

1936.84 --> 1942.0
of your time and energy which will be

1939.84 --> 1944.58
drawn in to be big because you're so

1942.0 --> 1946.769
good at it to waste it on doing things

1944.58 --> 1949.9089999999999
like that because it is kind of a waste

1946.769 --> 1952.559
of that precious energy and time

1949.909 --> 1954.919
especially if yeah for a lot of people I

1952.559 --> 1954.9189999999999
guess

1955.179 --> 1961.3890000000001
so it's to me it's just an addiction and

1959.169 --> 1964.239
I I stay away from it

1961.389 --> 1967.869
I am also I've never been a total

1964.239 --> 1970.929
champion of it i but it wasn't like a

1967.869 --> 1973.809
super nerd genius but I did get a lot of

1970.929 --> 1976.539
quick insight I would be absurdly good

1973.809 --> 1981.089
at guessing answers for example but

1976.539 --> 1986.799
really weirdly good where I would just

1981.089 --> 1989.44
see things instead of putting the

1986.799 --> 1994.649
numbers together and all that sometimes

1989.44 --> 1994.6490000000001
I didn't even understand it it was weird

2004.31 --> 2014.2
anyway that was my weird matha holics

2006.8 --> 2018.02
talk so yeah 9.8 meters a second square

2014.2 --> 2021.2
manifests in air changed the medium to

2018.02 --> 2029.95
water and what happens well it that's

2021.2 --> 2033.1100000000001
interesting it I think it wait does it

2029.95 --> 2039.3400000000001
well maybe the acceleration rate is kind

2033.11 --> 2041.9599999999998
of the same the rate not probably not no

2039.34 --> 2046.1299999999999
the rate would be lowered because the

2041.96 --> 2048.29
medium becomes denser in relation to the

2046.13 --> 2050.389
object falling it all depends on the

2048.29 --> 2054.37
differential the greater the

2050.389 --> 2058.36
differential so the thinner the medium

2054.37 --> 2061.37
for example very yeah almost a vacuum

2058.36 --> 2065.78
compared to the weight or the density of

2061.37 --> 2068.929
the object then the more profound the

2065.78 --> 2078.409
acceleration rate the yeah they have

2068.929 --> 2080.84
better it will confirm or it will be

2078.409 --> 2084.05
that 9.8 meters per second squared

2080.84 --> 2086.8990000000003
but the thicker the medium is in

2084.05 --> 2089.6000000000004
relation to the density of the object so

2086.899 --> 2094.87
water for example then that acceleration

2089.6 --> 2098.21
rate will also decrease I presume and

2094.87 --> 2101.74
the maximum velocity within the medium

2098.21 --> 2105.9700000000003
will also be reached earlier quicker

2101.74 --> 2109.45
there is like a D because the friction

2105.97 --> 2112.9399999999996
the medium of the density of it is

2109.45 --> 2116.24
higher just the maximum velocity within

2112.94 --> 2118.91
its descent will be reached quicker so

2116.24 --> 2124.22
all these factors are tied in with the

2118.91 --> 2126.74
relative density differential the bigger

2124.22 --> 2130.6299999999997
the difference between the density of

2126.74 --> 2130.6299999999997
the object and the density of the medium

2131.79 --> 2139.32
the further or or the the longer it will

2136.98 --> 2145.109
take for the maximum velocity to set in

2139.32 --> 2152.04
and the closer to the ideal acceleration

2145.109 --> 2154.7
rate it will find so is that good enough

2152.04 --> 2154.7
for you

2159.45 --> 2166.81
yeah maybe I need to publish this [ __ ]

2163.45 --> 2169.8689999999997
at this point you know but I have no

2166.81 --> 2171.7
idea how to do that it could be nice to

2169.869 --> 2174.73
get some help maybe I don't even know

2171.7 --> 2182.3489999999997
what I'm doing I'm literally just a

2174.73 --> 2185.22
student fooling around and that's how I

2182.349 --> 2185.2200000000003
feel anyway

2200.91 --> 2208.6499999999996
oh nice trick question director Stefan

2204.27 --> 2213.3
hey listen yeah well the thing is a man

2208.65 --> 2216.63
and the parachute they're they're tricky

2213.3 --> 2219.48
because they're kind of conjoined to

2216.63 --> 2222.7200000000003
different objects that have great

2219.48 --> 2225.51
differential in their density okay and

2222.72 --> 2230.39
while with the balloon normally the

2225.51 --> 2233.07
densities would because yet there is no

2230.39 --> 2236.43
distinct aerodynamics properties to a

2233.07 --> 2240.63
balloon is just hanging there it will be

2236.43 --> 2244.97
combined and the combined density of it

2240.63 --> 2247.29
all will set the relative density

2244.97 --> 2250.6699999999996
equilibrium point within the atmosphere

2247.29 --> 2254.46
when it where it can reach at that point

2250.67 --> 2258.06
but with parachute there is aerodynamics

2254.46 --> 2262.02
going on so there is like the wind or

2258.06 --> 2264.9
the density of the air is being used to

2262.02 --> 2266.88
create kind of a thrust for the very

2264.9 --> 2271.23
light material of the parachute which

2266.88 --> 2273.54
greatly relieves the whole thing so kind

2271.23 --> 2277.65
of the atmosphere it's going through

2273.54 --> 2280.92
becomes a part or an apparent part of

2277.65 --> 2286.4700000000003
the total density of the parachute and

2280.92 --> 2289.56
the person it's weird but that yet the

2286.47 --> 2294.2099999999996
drag I guess it greatly increases the

2289.56 --> 2296.67
the friction yeah that is it the giant

2294.21 --> 2301.95
surface and the dynamics of it creates

2296.67 --> 2304.05
maximum friction which causes yeah

2301.95 --> 2305.91
because of increased frictions just like

2304.05 --> 2309.3900000000003
if it would be descending in water it

2305.91 --> 2313.52
goes slower yes yes that is it that is

2309.39 --> 2316.65
it ha see

2313.52 --> 2316.65
[Music]

2326.359 --> 2332.15
no I don't write anything on paper oh I

2329.49 --> 2335.8799999999997
got a picture almost forgetting this I

2332.15 --> 2340.369
got a picture that I made is not related

2335.88 --> 2340.369
to this by the way but I want to show it

2343.579 --> 2355.9500000000003
right remember the the idea I had a long

2351.15 --> 2358.589
time ago about how the pyramids it's

2355.95 --> 2361.319
been proven how they have a certain

2358.589 --> 2365.13
because of the design have a certain

2361.319 --> 2366.75
energy fountain on top of them and that

2365.13 --> 2371.549
that could be used by giant flying

2366.75 --> 2374.91
cities to to charge themselves for

2371.549 --> 2377.7599999999998
flight in the ancient days well I made a

2374.91 --> 2379.98
drawing of it so it's black and white

2377.76 --> 2382.849
though I did my best I did this in like

2379.98 --> 2387.65
30 minutes anyway here you go

2382.849 --> 2387.65
so I hope you get what you're seeing I

2388.79 --> 2395.0
did have some drawing lessons actually

2392.16 --> 2395.0
quite a lot

2397.42 --> 2400.05
key

2411.23 --> 2420.05
I hope it's good enough to kind of make

2415.4 --> 2422.78
your geometrical mind switch into what

2420.05 --> 2428.829
it's supposed to represent the horizon

2422.78 --> 2431.63
is the it's not opes

2428.829 --> 2433.28
if the horizon isn't the thing going

2431.63 --> 2434.27
through the pyramid is not the horizon

2433.28 --> 2436.9100000000003
that's the river

2434.27 --> 2439.31
that's the there whatever the river is

2436.91 --> 2440.42
and yeah the horizon is actually just

2439.31 --> 2445.19
not visible

2440.42 --> 2450.38
barely it didn't come through in the

2445.19 --> 2453.14
scan anyway it's exactly exactly in

2450.38 --> 2455.1800000000003
between the the bottom of the flying

2453.14 --> 2462.859
city and the pyramid point it's exactly

2455.18 --> 2465.109
here so we thank you unicorn laser eyes

2462.859 --> 2470.17
for the five-dollar Supachai donation

2465.109 --> 2477.74
happy hot top torpedo month are in Wow

2470.17 --> 2479.839
okay thank you for that well art can be

2477.74 --> 2484.43
therapeutic oh especially if it's like a

2479.839 --> 2487.43
really good idea you have that yeah that

2484.43 --> 2493.16
deserves being drawn and I can do it you

2487.43 --> 2495.77
know do it again architecture and shapes

2493.16 --> 2497.45
is what I'm actually really good at

2495.77 --> 2504.619
drawing I've never been good at wrong

2497.45 --> 2508.5499999999997
people but landscapes and buildings and

2504.619 --> 2515.5
and with perspective I were always was

2508.55 --> 2515.5
kind of good at that so anyway

2518.5 --> 2528.559
the pyramid his perspective yeah yeah I

2524.51 --> 2532.67
was kind of the Giza Plateau but I or it

2528.559 --> 2536.7400000000002
was Giza Plateau a like sort of look I'm

2532.67 --> 2541.19
presuming that every pyramid was either

2536.74 --> 2543.2889999999998
built on some kind of water or very near

2541.19 --> 2546.049
water could also potentially be a lake

2543.289 --> 2548.15
perhaps because I think that most of

2546.049 --> 2552.279
them were water driven by running water

2548.15 --> 2552.279
which they could maybe they had

2553.42 --> 2557.839
electrostatic water pumps that kind of

2555.68 --> 2559.91
thing if you watch the pyramid code they

2557.839 --> 2562.73
actually do talk about that that it

2559.91 --> 2564.95
seems like they they had ideas about how

2562.73 --> 2569.51
water could literally be pushed around

2564.95 --> 2573.95
like a perpetual self engine it was

2569.51 --> 2576.4100000000003
pretty fascinating what what they what

2573.95 --> 2579.049
they talked about in that miniseries so

2576.41 --> 2583.519
yeah whether it is next to a river or

2579.049 --> 2586.849
next to a lake maybe some I don't know

2583.519 --> 2588.3489999999997
but I think it would have to be close to

2586.849 --> 2590.48
water because the running water

2588.349 --> 2592.9100000000003
underneath the channels of the pyramids

2590.48 --> 2594.89
which have proven to be there and they

2592.91 --> 2599.0
were clearly water channels not for

2594.89 --> 2602.6299999999997
travel more likely because of running

2599.0 --> 2605.48
water causes electricity and it rubs off

2602.63 --> 2609.1600000000003
on the stone it's going through so

2605.48 --> 2609.16
that's the that's part of the system

2612.47 --> 2619.0699999999997
that's the part of the system that the

2614.92 --> 2622.37
the ancients used look there may have

2619.07 --> 2626.15
been all you know they may figure oh

2622.37 --> 2628.4
wait just put a freaking power generator

2626.15 --> 2630.44
and just put it in that spot right there

2628.4 --> 2635.69
and keep it running it'll do the same

2630.44 --> 2638.51
thing you know I'm just saying in way

2635.69 --> 2641.63
WAY long time ago where everything was

2638.51 --> 2645.2900000000004
pretty me yeah pretty raw mechanical

2641.63 --> 2648.38
stone technology electrics just very raw

2645.29 --> 2655.82
that's how I think they originally did

2648.38 --> 2659.36
it all and that could even be before the

2655.82 --> 2661.28
Seas as it is said or before the flood

2659.36 --> 2663.92
because there was probably still water

2661.28 --> 2666.23
there and they could just use pools of

2663.92 --> 2671.21
it and just pump it around even like

2666.23 --> 2675.65
that you know because just conceptualize

2671.21 --> 2678.32
it okay the Pyramid of Giza what if the

2675.65 --> 2681.52
flood happened it flooded did work of

2678.32 --> 2687.23
course anymore then flood came down and

2681.52 --> 2691.13
the river the themes just kind of went

2687.23 --> 2693.53
right yeah went right through it or

2691.13 --> 2695.54
right past it again it kind of fell back

2693.53 --> 2698.42
in the place so that it could still work

2695.54 --> 2700.46
and then whatever locals would

2698.42 --> 2704.48
eventually be able to repair it perhaps

2700.46 --> 2706.9900000000002
some of the Ancients and then get it

2704.48 --> 2706.9900000000002
working again

2709.78 --> 2721.6600000000003
just saying you know the the original

2719.22 --> 2724.6899999999996
Atlanteans might have built the pyramids

2721.66 --> 2728.5899999999997
pretty rapidly very well-organized in

2724.69 --> 2730.84
control but yeah that doesn't mean that

2728.59 --> 2733.6600000000003
it could pass they could that any

2730.84 --> 2737.44
survivors couldn't possibly repair it

2733.66 --> 2741.2799999999997
with lower tech as it were it would take

2737.44 --> 2744.2200000000003
a lot longer to repair it but yeah it

2741.28 --> 2748.21
only needs to repair so and otherwise

2744.22 --> 2750.91
you don't have anything so I don't know

2748.21 --> 2752.95
makes sense that that pyramids could

2750.91 --> 2755.16
have been used ever after the flood as

2752.95 --> 2755.16
well

2771.42 --> 2783.329
you me hmm

2774.71 --> 2785.94
thanks but to be fair though I am making

2783.329 --> 2789.0
this up I'm just putting the pieces

2785.94 --> 2791.88
together that I have found and I'm

2789.0 --> 2794.609
entertaining my concept that I'm very

2791.88 --> 2797.19
convinced that is very likely to be the

2794.609 --> 2799.529
case and that is the combination of

2797.19 --> 2801.569
giants and pyramids and how they were

2799.529 --> 2804.9
part of the building of them quickly and

2801.569 --> 2807.779
that they produce energy field that

2804.9 --> 2811.71
would feed the Giants easily in order to

2807.779 --> 2815.069
stabilize society and not create so much

2811.71 --> 2819.809
hunger in the Giants and it seems

2815.069 --> 2822.72
balance and then the the the logical

2819.809 --> 2825.329
consequences of it all I think this is

2822.72 --> 2827.22
kind of what I do as a game master as

2825.329 --> 2829.9500000000003
well you know I just you just have a

2827.22 --> 2832.0789999999997
setting and then it's like okay what are

2829.95 --> 2834.72
certain individuals with power are what

2832.079 --> 2839.099
are they gonna come up with what are

2834.72 --> 2840.839
they driven to do and then just let them

2839.099 --> 2843.299
do their steps and everybody does their

2840.839 --> 2850.3089999999997
steps try to let it unfold as natural as

2843.299 --> 2853.98
possible and yeah I can do that with

2850.309 --> 2856.4300000000003
well if with unleashing things that I've

2853.98 --> 2859.0190000000002
conceptualized that I think are very

2856.43 --> 2863.25
worthwhile entertaining at least and

2859.019 --> 2865.6499999999996
valid potentially to then put those

2863.25 --> 2870.329
pieces together with the other things

2865.65 --> 2872.42
about history that are kind of see in

2870.329 --> 2880.65
yeah in the background non-official

2872.42 --> 2883.259
flood the yeah the Atlanteans pyramids

2880.65 --> 2885.9
being found around the world just and

2883.259 --> 2890.369
the natural consequences of all the

2885.9 --> 2893.64
things and what mankind would do and the

2890.369 --> 2895.829
Phoenicians and all of it like what

2893.64 --> 2900.18
happened with all the remnants of all

2895.829 --> 2903.3590000000004
the Atlantic technology and knowledge

2900.18 --> 2905.1299999999997
and what was made with that and out of

2903.359 --> 2906.869
that what new cultures and

2905.13 --> 2910.9500000000003
principals were born out of that what

2906.869 --> 2918.539
new groups why did they come from that

2910.95 --> 2922.109
that's basically it and hey I'm just

2918.539 --> 2928.0690000000004
yeah I was I thought it the whole flying

2922.109 --> 2933.15
cities and what is it the mahabharata--

2928.069 --> 2936.569
from the Indian ancient lures that

2933.15 --> 2938.9300000000003
always greatly inspired me especially

2936.569 --> 2941.369
with an take attack as that came along

2938.93 --> 2945.8089999999997
into my attention span through the

2941.369 --> 2953.279
internet and Tesla idea and my concept

2945.809 --> 2955.259
with the pyramids and the giant yeah it

2953.279 --> 2958.68
was bound to happen and I hope that

2955.259 --> 2961.829
maybe one day I could get some or maybe

2958.68 --> 2965.839
I could do it myself get some really

2961.829 --> 2971.3390000000004
good fantasy painter to just make that

2965.839 --> 2972.69
absolutely perfect with figures in it I

2971.339 --> 2975.019
don't know it could something like this

2972.69 --> 2977.369
could be such an awesome painting

2975.019 --> 2983.7
unfortunately I've never been that good

2977.369 --> 2987.3900000000003
at painting myself could do a little

2983.7 --> 2990.47
that's it now I've always used paintings

2987.39 --> 2993.359
and drawings more to assist my own

2990.47 --> 2996.2
conceptual visual visualizations than

2993.359 --> 3000.069
that I perfected the art of imagery

2996.2 --> 3000.069
recipe yeah

3005.29 --> 3011.14
anyway oh not a chat

3018.16 --> 3024.16
okay it's funny when trolls can

3021.34 --> 3026.1400000000003
sometimes accidentally say something

3024.16 --> 3039.2799999999997
interesting when they're just trying to

3026.14 --> 3044.8599999999997
be ridiculous mmm anyway I'm gonna round

3039.28 --> 3047.13
out the show I think it's not been too

3044.86 --> 3047.13
long

3056.04 --> 3065.63
and all right I have some ideas that

3060.78 --> 3068.1600000000003
kind of came up to me yesterday evening

3065.63 --> 3071.15
what I could do it and it's kind of

3068.16 --> 3077.2799999999997
weird because I visioned memories of it

3071.15 --> 3079.6800000000003
but I'm not even gonna talk about the

3077.28 --> 3083.7900000000004
details but Maydan have to do something

3079.68 --> 3086.06
with a potential career path that could

3083.79 --> 3086.06
work

3089.2 --> 3098.5
that I could adapt to properly and I

3094.26 --> 3100.42
don't know maybe dud you know I try

3098.5 --> 3103.78
never to have too big expectation with

3100.42 --> 3106.599
whatever and he kind of job things and

3103.78 --> 3109.8390000000004
everything and I've ever engaged in so

3106.599 --> 3114.549
far and I really tried just she can

3109.839 --> 3115.45
never expect you to be the one whatever

3114.549 --> 3122.109
that was

3115.45 --> 3123.8489999999997
but yeah I'm gonna gradually do some

3122.109 --> 3129.8489999999997
