still clouded but

94.5 --> 102.259
it's not really covering the Sun as much

98.88 --> 102.259
there's also a lot of wind

104.52 --> 109.79899999999999
seems like the rain has stopped for now

106.86 --> 113.659
did rain

109.799 --> 113.659
a lot yesterday evening

113.88 --> 118.439
although not continuously it's not like

116.159 --> 119.59
everything drowned but still there was

118.439 --> 120.77999999999999
plenty of rain

119.59 --> 123.72
[Music]

120.78 --> 125.759
things are Greening up out there I mean

123.72 --> 128.299
you can literally see it in the grass

125.759 --> 128.299
everywhere

129.179 --> 135.06
right the plants are just doing just

131.58 --> 137.34
fine the new parsley plant is really

135.06 --> 140.18
exploding

137.34 --> 140.18
which is great

140.4 --> 144.9
I thought it was like kind of small

142.14 --> 147.83999999999997
looking but I mean it's growing quick

144.9 --> 150.63
now bro

147.84 --> 153.77
growing a lot that's cool

150.63 --> 153.76999999999998
[Music]

154.86 --> 158.72000000000003
I said plants are doing great

161.34 --> 168.48
except maybe for one of the oreganos

165.18 --> 172.28
it seems to be I don't know just not

168.48 --> 172.28
really feeling great

173.64 --> 178.79999999999998
purple leaves

176.28 --> 180.36
and all that well the other one seems to

178.8 --> 183.14000000000001
be just fine it's not having any more

180.36 --> 183.14000000000001
purple leaves

184.319 --> 188.76
anyway

186.3 --> 192.18
hello Cleary first in chat Bill Nye the

188.76 --> 198.51
science denier clammy good to see you

192.18 --> 203.28
it is Sunday the 2nd of July 2023

198.51 --> 204.12
[Music]

203.28 --> 207.219
temperature

204.12 --> 207.219
[Music]

207.239 --> 212.28
21 degrees Celsius

210.3 --> 214.76000000000002
right feels a lot better than yesterday

212.28 --> 214.76
though

215.94 --> 222.38
I mean yesterday was kind of chilly

219.23 --> 222.38
[Music]

228.5 --> 234.68
oh Luna loves you hey it's been a while

231.659 --> 234.67999999999998
good to see you

235.14 --> 239.48
[Music]

236.64 --> 239.48
foreign

246.959 --> 251.459
got some rookola here

249.48 --> 252.89999999999998
I kind of skipped out on that for two

251.459 --> 255.36
days

252.9 --> 259.22
I really missed it

255.36 --> 259.22
so that's great to have it back

260.639 --> 262.76
um

263.69 --> 267.54
[Music]

275.699 --> 281.6
oh okay Cleary interesting

279.06 --> 281.6
hmm

283.55 --> 286.92
[Music]

290.46 --> 296.53999999999996
right so anyway

292.68 --> 296.54
yeah yesterday's show was a blast

296.759 --> 301.139
the whole Dell situation was kind of

299.22 --> 304.08000000000004
crazy

301.139 --> 306.72
that he came in here and did all that

304.08 --> 308.75899999999996
and as expected he did a whole live

306.72 --> 310.68
stream rant about I told him to do go do

308.759 --> 313.86
that and he he did

310.68 --> 317.52
he was really heard about what I said

313.86 --> 319.139
for some reason so it seemed

317.52 --> 321.59999999999997
I don't know what the hell's wrong with

319.139 --> 324.6
him but I mean everything I said was

321.6 --> 327.12
pretty straightforward and honest

324.6 --> 329.53900000000004
most of it not even with any kind of ill

327.12 --> 329.539
intent

330.72 --> 335.699
but uh

333.12 --> 338.82
yeah that show of his was ridiculous and

335.699 --> 342.6
the chat was predictably filled with

338.82 --> 345.56
fed and Arwin hating trolls as some of

342.6 --> 345.56
you have perceived

349.62 --> 356.36
I wasn't gonna hang around in that

353.039 --> 356.36
absolutely ridiculous

356.88 --> 365.699
he didn't have any arguments I mean

361.139 --> 368.82
Dell yesterday the the closest I would

365.699 --> 370.74
grade it to his his performance right

368.82 --> 373.68
then closest

370.74 --> 376.919
I could grade it as is like a Sean

373.68 --> 379.8
Hawkins level hangout it was really

376.919 --> 382.46
really pathetic

379.8 --> 382.46000000000004
okay

383.28 --> 385.88
anyway

391.34 --> 396.29999999999995
Dell thanks for all the advertisement

393.78 --> 399.05999999999995
you made yourself look like an ass and

396.3 --> 401.94
I'm glad that you spread my video

399.06 --> 403.86
that emphasized that fact so that the

401.94 --> 405.419
people watching you

403.86 --> 407.34000000000003
because they think you're a clown and

405.419 --> 409.31899999999996
entertaining that way

407.34 --> 413.15999999999997
realize that

409.319 --> 416.28000000000003
I'm yeah I'm not buying your [ __ ]

413.16 --> 419.88000000000005
this [ __ ] that you're doing right now

416.28 --> 423.919
so thanks for the advertisement

419.88 --> 423.919
that what you did actually helped me

427.919 --> 430.46
anyway

433.41 --> 439.46000000000004
[Music]

436.199 --> 439.46000000000004
got a lot of views

448.319 --> 452.759
right

450.3 --> 454.74
uh other than that it was kind of a

452.759 --> 457.62
quiet day

454.74 --> 460.16
seriously there were barely any streams

457.62 --> 460.16
of any sort

469.139 --> 475.139
uh Quantum conscious had another video

471.539 --> 478.08
great he's like rolling out his book the

475.139 --> 482.52
unnamed reality book

478.08 --> 485.4
and just I mean this is like his main

482.52 --> 490.62
narrative look what you call it his main

485.4 --> 492.9
thing his main theme all put together

490.62 --> 495.12
like this and it's interesting I mean

492.9 --> 497.15999999999997
it's like it feels like the culmination

495.12 --> 498.72
of like his

497.16 --> 500.51000000000005
perspective

498.72 --> 501.66
so it's interesting

500.51 --> 504.539
[Music]

501.66 --> 507.6
to wonder how long it will keep going

504.539 --> 509.87899999999996
but that book of his

507.6 --> 512.879
[Music]

509.879 --> 512.879
uh

519.959 --> 524.0989999999999
yeah and I hung around on the the

522.06 --> 527.4799999999999
premiere

524.099 --> 527.48
there's an Oakley Channel

528.6 --> 531.62
and that was fun

536.519 --> 541.94
Sean Hawkins is the poster boy for the

538.86 --> 541.94
glove yeah kind of

542.04 --> 548.8389999999999
is there like primary the culmination of

545.94 --> 548.839
Target groups

554.67 --> 557.8299999999999
[Music]

567.54 --> 576.38
Sean disliking me is how I know I'm good

570.899 --> 576.38
okay I wouldn't go that far I mean

579.66 --> 585.42
he's also said some nice things not that

583.26 --> 588.98
that really means a lot in the face of

585.42 --> 588.9799999999999
all the other things he's saying

591.72 --> 594.86
but I mean

595.98 --> 602.4590000000001
it doesn't seem to me like he's actually

599.1 --> 605.0400000000001
a real like communist Marxist agent or

602.459 --> 607.6199999999999
something he's just

605.04 --> 609.899
his rebellious dude that really has no

607.62 --> 612.899
more point and so he's just sticking to

609.899 --> 617.3
this thing sticking to this mission

612.899 --> 617.3
but I mean he's not doing any damage

629.22 --> 635.5400000000001
that Sean Hawkins is how I find my

631.44 --> 635.5400000000001
channel really I didn't know that part

636.58 --> 639.639
[Music]

640.2 --> 643.98
okay

641.7 --> 644.82
okay well in that case that that's kind

643.98 --> 647.88
of funny

644.82 --> 649.2600000000001
yeah bill I I read the second part of

647.88 --> 652.56
your sentence

649.26 --> 654.12
of your text first and then I read the

652.56 --> 656.5999999999999
first part I don't know why I do that

654.12 --> 656.6
sometimes

657.48 --> 664.38
never heard of him well you're not

659.76 --> 666.899
missing out on anything I hbi

664.38 --> 671.0
I mean he's technically an anti-flat

666.899 --> 671.0
earth troll but he's really stupid

673.2 --> 679.8000000000001
I mean he's the guy that

676.1 --> 681.899
metaphorically would just be like you

679.8 --> 684.42
know the shapes thing that little

681.899 --> 685.86
toddlers play with to understand shapes

684.42 --> 688.56
you have to put the square through the

685.86 --> 690.98
square and all that sort of oh he's just

688.56 --> 690.9799999999999
like

691.2 --> 695.839
the square doesn't fit through the

693.839 --> 698.8800000000001
circle

695.839 --> 700.44
and he just keeps doing that for like

698.88 --> 704.1
two years straight coming everywhere

700.44 --> 706.6800000000001
like this it doesn't fit this like the

704.1 --> 709.26
whole star rotation on the southern

706.68 --> 711.959
hemisphere is the other way around it's

709.26 --> 716.22
it's like

711.959 --> 719.2199999999999
like genuinely [ __ ] like

716.22 --> 721.62
I think that the

719.22 --> 723.6600000000001
yeah I think that the average Down

721.62 --> 726.42
syndrome person

723.66 --> 729.7199999999999
that's not been like super compromised

726.42 --> 731.76
with drugs or inferior self-image

729.72 --> 734.7
but that's like actually kind of happy

731.76 --> 737.519
right as they usually are when they're

734.7 --> 738.899
not mistreated

737.519 --> 742.079
that's the funny thing about Down

738.899 --> 744.42
syndrome kids and adults but I think

742.079 --> 747.7199999999999
that even they do have an average less

744.42 --> 751.3199999999999
intelligence that's very palpable but

747.72 --> 752.76
they would understand how that is really

751.32 --> 757.6800000000001
stupid

752.76 --> 759.48
it really stupid chunk or really stupid

757.68 --> 764.04
this thing

759.48 --> 767.339
star rotation on the other side

764.04 --> 768.54
go the other way where it start rotate

767.339 --> 771.98
both

768.54 --> 771.98
you just turn around

772.98 --> 777.839
like a literal Down syndrome person gets

777.18 --> 780.899
it

777.839 --> 784.2
Sean Hawkins doesn't get it

780.899 --> 786.959
even though people are telling him this

784.2 --> 790.5
like to his face

786.959 --> 792.899
for a year two years straight yeah

790.5 --> 795.06
that's how [ __ ] stupid he is I mean

792.899 --> 796.74
Down syndrome people are not that stupid

795.06 --> 799.8
literally

796.74 --> 803.12
I mean as I know it sounds funny but

799.8 --> 803.12
it's actually real

808.44 --> 812.7790000000001
you thought it was Sean Hawkins for a

810.72 --> 812.779
minute

822.44 --> 826.7600000000001
hello dank and into the break

832.74 --> 835.339
okay

851.54 --> 856.04
after you had my snack today yeah

857.339 --> 861.0600000000001
it's kind of my breakfast the Illuminati

859.44 --> 863.1
Chris I don't even eat it on the show

861.06 --> 866.04
anymore usually

863.1 --> 868.76
unless I'm kind of late or something

866.04 --> 868.76
but uh

869.04 --> 876.48
I end up not eating a lot at night

872.519 --> 879.839
I actually like really didn't eat

876.48 --> 881.82
yesterday I kind of fasted I felt like

879.839 --> 884.0400000000001
it's necessary and there's like a lot of

881.82 --> 886.44
stressful [ __ ] going on everywhere and

884.04 --> 888.5999999999999
when that happens even eating just

886.44 --> 891.12
doesn't sit well

888.6 --> 894.5600000000001
so I kind of just did need but then in

891.12 --> 894.5600000000001
the morning I get really hungry

900.42 --> 906.779
hey flutter Sage

903.6 --> 911.22
right so if I fast like in the evening

906.779 --> 913.38
and the night then I just like I have to

911.22 --> 916.26
eat something in the morning or I like I

913.38 --> 918.899
just I will just not

916.26 --> 921.6
be able to do anything

918.899 --> 923.16
I'll be too hungry

921.6 --> 925.38
uh

923.16 --> 926.4599999999999
like even just eating rokule I wouldn't

925.38 --> 928.199
do it

926.46 --> 932.1800000000001
[Music]

928.199 --> 932.18
anyway hey LSG good to see you

938.94 --> 942.109
[Music]

955.26 --> 957.5
what

960.74 --> 968.66
wait what

962.839 --> 968.6600000000001
Anthony cumia talking about about who

969.839 --> 974.6
who is Anthony come here talking about

972.0 --> 974.6
moxie

985.18 --> 992.8199999999999
[Music]

989.82 --> 992.82
one

994.6 --> 997.82
[Music]

999.899 --> 1005.169
more

1002.02 --> 1005.169
[Music]

1005.24 --> 1009.019
I did watch Owen Benjamin show from

1007.399 --> 1012.88
Thursday

1009.019 --> 1012.88
which I completely missed

1013.1 --> 1021.139
of Flat Earth in general oh okay oh I'm

1015.92 --> 1023.9799999999999
flat Earth am I okay I am flattered

1021.139 --> 1023.98
okay

1031.64 --> 1039.14
I mean like if Anthony Kumi I wouldn't

1033.74 --> 1039.14
mention me by name that would be weird

1045.26 --> 1050.419
he probably wouldn't have a lot of good

1047.54 --> 1053.86
things to say I mean everything that I

1050.419 --> 1053.8600000000001
say probably really

1055.48 --> 1061.52
probably so I don't care

1059.48 --> 1064.1
and old Benjamin goes after him

1061.52 --> 1067.6399999999999
rightfully so

1064.1 --> 1071.48
he did that on the Thursday show

1067.64 --> 1073.8200000000002
with the gardener

1071.48 --> 1076.22
I did not see that one live but I mean

1073.82 --> 1077.96
it I watched it back it was really

1076.22 --> 1081.4
interesting

1077.96 --> 1084.32
and Gardner went like really deep

1081.4 --> 1087.26
really really in the mechanics like very

1084.32 --> 1088.9399999999998
seriously it was very well

1087.26 --> 1091.039
put together

1088.94 --> 1092.8400000000001
like it was comprehensible the way he

1091.039 --> 1096.559
explained it and

1092.84 --> 1098.36
like he went in some kind of difficult

1096.559 --> 1100.8799999999999
ground

1098.36 --> 1103.2199999999998
like with conceptual ether and

1100.88 --> 1106.16
everything referencing it shout burger

1103.22 --> 1107.419
also which is really fascinating shell

1106.16 --> 1110.0800000000002
Burger

1107.419 --> 1112.8200000000002
like every

1110.08 --> 1115.22
worthwhile intelligent person that I've

1112.82 --> 1117.3799999999999
ever met in my past would always talk

1115.22 --> 1119.6000000000001
about that

1117.38 --> 1121.94
like so did uh

1119.6 --> 1125.6
the guy that I first got into Flat Earth

1121.94 --> 1128.1200000000001
with before 2015 who then dropped out he

1125.6 --> 1130.1599999999999
was all and he wasn't he was a physicist

1128.12 --> 1134.26
effectively

1130.16 --> 1134.26
and he would also like bring that up

1136.64 --> 1142.4
really fascinating stuff anyway

1139.82 --> 1144.559
yeah that show from Thursday is really

1142.4 --> 1147.0800000000002
interesting and for my own Benjamin

1144.559 --> 1149.48
definitely recommend you watched it

1147.08 --> 1151.6399999999999
and you almost I almost at some point

1149.48 --> 1154.58
you think like oh no he's gonna invoke

1151.64 --> 1156.7990000000002
ether isn't he for light ether but he

1154.58 --> 1158.72
didn't really do that

1156.799 --> 1159.98
so that was like

1158.72 --> 1162.679
huh

1159.98 --> 1164.96
but he did get into like the dielectric

1162.679 --> 1167.419
plane thing and that was annoying

1164.96 --> 1170.24
because it's like

1167.419 --> 1173.7800000000002
it's only a model bro

1170.24 --> 1174.799
you ain't gonna very manipulate it

1173.78 --> 1176.96
right

1174.799 --> 1179.6
I mean that

1176.96 --> 1183.32
that hovering Guru you described is not

1179.6 --> 1186.98
gonna hover like a thousand feet up

1183.32 --> 1189.3799999999999
it's gonna be very close to the ground

1186.98 --> 1193.46
because all that electrical influence is

1189.38 --> 1194.5390000000002
all very local very short range it's not

1193.46 --> 1197.0
a field

1194.539 --> 1199.7
so but anyway

1197.0 --> 1202.84
despite that it was still very worth

1199.7 --> 1202.8400000000001
while listening to

1207.2 --> 1209.96
yeah

1207.81 --> 1213.44
[Music]

1209.96 --> 1217.059
oh Boomers yeah I don't know who the

1213.44 --> 1217.059
hell would watch Anthony Korea

1217.22 --> 1222.52
it's

1219.679 --> 1222.52
I don't know

1230.8 --> 1236.1399999999999
[Music]

1232.94 --> 1236.14
it's a waste of time

1242.57 --> 1246.25
[Music]

1250.76 --> 1255.039
huh hey narrow laning

1255.679 --> 1260.1200000000001
yep

1258.08 --> 1262.1599999999999
I know

1260.12 --> 1263.7199999999998
yeah he did come in and acted very

1262.16 --> 1266.3600000000001
belligerent

1263.72 --> 1269.059
and it was literally ad homing

1266.36 --> 1271.039
and I was really polite I actually kind

1269.059 --> 1273.44
of like welcomed it in and was like oh

1271.039 --> 1277.039
you oh you're still on that

1273.44 --> 1279.26
so I I palpably on my show did not have

1277.039 --> 1282.08
any ill intent or

1279.26 --> 1284.179
I I didn't lure him into a trap he he

1282.08 --> 1287.1789999999999
just kept

1284.179 --> 1287.179
misbehaving

1287.96 --> 1293.98
and he didn't listen

1289.94 --> 1293.98
so then I gave him the full treatment

1306.52 --> 1311.3799999999999
Dell is angry about everything yeah no

1309.02 --> 1311.3799999999999
[ __ ]

1323.72 --> 1329.78
did you see that no I didn't watch the

1326.24 --> 1332.24
whole thing but I was aware of it

1329.78 --> 1337.12
I did click on my and then suddenly saw

1332.24 --> 1337.1200000000001
Maya or heard and saw myself there

1337.82 --> 1344.299
but I mean I don't need to watch like

1341.419 --> 1346.1000000000001
longer than two seconds to know exactly

1344.299 --> 1349.4
what he will be doing

1346.1 --> 1352.84
because he always does that the same way

1349.4 --> 1352.8400000000001
with every video

1353.78 --> 1359.02
except in this case you have absolutely

1355.88 --> 1359.0200000000002
nothing to stand on

1359.6 --> 1363.28
it had no Foundation

1363.38 --> 1368.24
I was polite to him

1365.78 --> 1371.36
I was cordial I was friendly

1368.24 --> 1373.88
despite him clearly being upset right

1371.36 --> 1375.799
that that was my feel on it as a

1373.88 --> 1377.3600000000001
friendly like oh yeah the hell's just in

1375.799 --> 1380.3799999999999
a bit of a

1377.36 --> 1380.3799999999999
bit of a twist

1381.86 --> 1390.3799999999999
but then he just started to go savanye

1386.24 --> 1392.6
it's like no Dell don't do that no no

1390.38 --> 1395.5390000000002
you don't want to do that

1392.6 --> 1398.059
but he did so then I gave him a full

1395.539 --> 1400.95
analysis treatment

1398.059 --> 1402.5
and even withheld on some of the more

1400.95 --> 1405.919
[Music]

1402.5 --> 1408.159
lashing Expressions just did it very

1405.919 --> 1408.159
cold

1411.14 --> 1417.5
and yeah that blatantly got to him

1414.26 --> 1420.1
because he was probably super upset the

1417.5 --> 1420.1
rest of the day

1420.26 --> 1424.82
but yeah I mean if you don't want to be

1422.96 --> 1426.799
upset the rest of the day for looking

1424.82 --> 1429.08
like a complete ass

1426.799 --> 1432.1399999999999
or thinking that the world has turned

1429.08 --> 1434.72
against you when you blatantly start

1432.14 --> 1437.1200000000001
fights

1434.72 --> 1439.88
and you start at homes you came to me

1437.12 --> 1442.34
start and humming right so you literally

1439.88 --> 1445.46
did it to yourself

1442.34 --> 1447.62
it all hurts so he has to rant and Rave

1445.46 --> 1449.24
about it

1447.62 --> 1451.539
it's not going to lead to any point

1449.24 --> 1451.539
though

1452.78 --> 1458.44
his point is just to look like you're

1454.76 --> 1458.44
just holding on to this book

1458.62 --> 1464.799
oh it's also funny but it doesn't make

1461.6 --> 1464.799
any [ __ ] sense though

1468.32 --> 1474.08
and looking at a thing fall it doesn't

1471.32 --> 1475.7
prove anything as I literally addressed

1474.08 --> 1477.1399999999999
it literally said like yeah but what

1475.7 --> 1481.3400000000001
about the air bubble and the water

1477.14 --> 1483.44
bottle and like yeah yeah that's

1481.34 --> 1486.08
let's look into advanced relative

1483.44 --> 1487.64
density and explain exactly

1486.08 --> 1491.059
what happens

1487.64 --> 1493.3400000000001
how it happens why it happens and what

1491.059 --> 1496.28
could happen further

1493.34 --> 1499.039
under different circumstances

1496.28 --> 1501.74
and he just

1499.039 --> 1503.419
didn't hear a thing I said you didn't

1501.74 --> 1506.44
hear it he didn't listen he didn't care

1503.419 --> 1506.44
he ignored it

1507.44 --> 1512.38
and just started at homing and attacking

1510.2 --> 1512.38
more

1513.14 --> 1516.039
it's pathetic

1521.059 --> 1529.039
I mean if anybody ever shows up to me

1526.34 --> 1532.9399999999998
even if they'd be Scottish

1529.039 --> 1535.46
I would not send them over to Dell if

1532.94 --> 1538.1000000000001
they wanted to learn about Flat Earth

1535.46 --> 1539.9
I mean if somebody's full into flatter

1538.1 --> 1541.1
they already know the arguments they

1539.9 --> 1543.44
they're like

1541.1 --> 1546.02
they've followed the Flat Earth debate

1543.44 --> 1548.9
they know exactly all the arguments how

1546.02 --> 1551.299
to how to use them and all that then I

1548.9 --> 1554.72
tell them like hey you want to see some

1551.299 --> 1556.58
really funny but crazy angry Scottish

1554.72 --> 1560.1200000000001
man Scotsman

1556.58 --> 1562.52
that's a flat earther it's been doing it

1560.12 --> 1565.1
forever go to Dells you gotta check it

1562.52 --> 1566.539
out yeah but I'm not sending people over

1565.1 --> 1569.1789999999999
there

1566.539 --> 1570.559
if I want them to understand Flat Earth

1569.179 --> 1574.96
arguments

1570.559 --> 1574.96
because Del is ridiculous

1575.0 --> 1580.58
and is barely comprehensible anyway I I

1577.46 --> 1583.279
doubt that even a regular Scotsman

1580.58 --> 1585.3799999999999
or Scott's woman would actually even

1583.279 --> 1588.02
understand what he's talking about

1585.38 --> 1590.72
because besides him being unintelligible

1588.02 --> 1593.12
he's also just very messy

1590.72 --> 1595.34
with his sentence construction

1593.12 --> 1598.039
so yeah he gets the the Scottish

1595.34 --> 1600.6789999999999
Expressions correctly makes it very cool

1598.039 --> 1603.08
but the mechanics he totally [ __ ] up

1600.679 --> 1606.74
continually

1603.08 --> 1609.1399999999999
it's barely stuck together it's barely

1606.74 --> 1611.059
completed he doesn't have full oversight

1609.14 --> 1614.48
over the workings of it always

1611.059 --> 1616.039
probably not particularly talented

1614.48 --> 1618.559
to do that

1616.039 --> 1620.539
I think he has more Talent actually in

1618.559 --> 1623.02
language and expression than he has in

1620.539 --> 1623.02
mechanics

1627.38 --> 1630.98
that's probably also the reason why

1629.179 --> 1632.3600000000001
people hang around there because it's

1630.98 --> 1634.46
entertaining

1632.36 --> 1636.3799999999999
doesn't make any [ __ ] sense but it's

1634.46 --> 1640.3600000000001
entertaining because he does have talent

1636.38 --> 1640.3600000000001
for expression and all that okay

1641.24 --> 1643.9
anyway

1649.88 --> 1655.73
did I play my explanation

1652.57 --> 1655.73
[Music]

1662.24 --> 1667.4
why he does that

1664.52 --> 1669.2
because he is an envious [ __ ] he's a

1667.4 --> 1672.5
gamma [ __ ]

1669.2 --> 1675.5
and he just has a problem with any

1672.5 --> 1677.72
perceived form of authority even when it

1675.5 --> 1680.96
is intellectual Authority

1677.72 --> 1683.84
when it's actually provable

1680.96 --> 1686.3600000000001
and so he just goes in Rebel arousing

1683.84 --> 1689.059
like a scumbag

1686.36 --> 1692.299
like an ass

1689.059 --> 1694.58
like an sjw like Dell is kind of like a

1692.299 --> 1696.44
social justice Warrior type

1694.58 --> 1699.32
except he's not

1696.44 --> 1701.9
like with that stupid political movement

1699.32 --> 1705.1399999999999
he's not a kitty anymore

1701.9 --> 1708.02
but he's he is like that

1705.14 --> 1710.419
yeah but we don't need a social justice

1708.02 --> 1713.539
Warrior [ __ ] or Rebel

1710.419 --> 1716.23
we need people that actually get the

1713.539 --> 1718.1589999999999
mechanics and the arguments

1716.23 --> 1720.679
[Music]

1718.159 --> 1723.679
Flat Earth that is flat earth needs

1720.679 --> 1726.14
people who understands things

1723.679 --> 1730.1200000000001
not who are rebellious and will just

1726.14 --> 1730.1200000000001
seek out fights for no damn good reason

1739.34 --> 1746.32
right but he could take a swing at me if

1741.26 --> 1746.32
he wants I mean what is he proving

1746.72 --> 1750.799
nothing

1748.46 --> 1754.3400000000001
it's it's just Sean Hawkins maneuver

1750.799 --> 1756.74
like does Sean Hawkins ever achieve

1754.34 --> 1758.899
anything with his videos

1756.74 --> 1761.779
I mean the worst that get out of that is

1758.899 --> 1763.82
that some really [ __ ] stupid trolls

1761.779 --> 1766.039
that really hate me

1763.82 --> 1769.1589999999999
go and watch that and then for a second

1766.039 --> 1770.539
just believe like I am defeated or

1769.159 --> 1773.2990000000002
something so they get a little over

1770.539 --> 1774.1589999999999
courageous like I watched a video of

1773.299 --> 1777.02
yourself

1774.159 --> 1779.779
because they're really [ __ ] pathetic

1777.02 --> 1781.399
and it Fizzles very quickly right so

1779.779 --> 1784.46
that's the result that's

1781.399 --> 1788.84
the fire that it awakens is a bunch of

1784.46 --> 1792.02
[ __ ] up Nutter really dumb trolls that

1788.84 --> 1794.5
come over and and like start oh I saw

1792.02 --> 1797.059
something that completely destroyed you

1794.5 --> 1798.5
you know how that goes but it doesn't

1797.059 --> 1801.559
last very long

1798.5 --> 1805.36
and people certainly don't remember it

1801.559 --> 1805.36
as in people that matter

1806.059 --> 1812.24
that actually are trusted and have like

1810.02 --> 1814.8799999999999
a good memory of what's going on and

1812.24 --> 1817.7
like those people don't give a [ __ ]

1814.88 --> 1821.8400000000001
about these stupid rants

1817.7 --> 1823.94
from Sean Hawkins or Adele

1821.84 --> 1826.9399999999998
right they might take a look at it and

1823.94 --> 1829.3990000000001
see like hey is there something to this

1826.94 --> 1831.98
because I don't know Dell or a Rowdy

1829.399 --> 1834.9189999999999
Rebel Rouser that's just gonna attack

1831.98 --> 1837.08
anyone well they might just like pick up

1834.919 --> 1838.88
certain details and they might have

1837.08 --> 1840.6789999999999
found out something about me that you

1838.88 --> 1843.679
they wouldn't know

1840.679 --> 1846.02
right and I'm like yeah watch it let's

1843.679 --> 1849.02
see what he got he doesn't have anything

1846.02 --> 1850.94
it's all at homes all emphasizing things

1849.02 --> 1855.5
that I'm very open about

1850.94 --> 1858.88
because there is no secrets

1855.5 --> 1858.88
there's no secrets

1859.039 --> 1865.48
it's nothing that you can expose about

1861.32 --> 1865.48
me that I haven't openly talked about

1870.679 --> 1877.1200000000001
so all those people that will check it

1872.96 --> 1877.1200000000001
out they will see oh yep

1877.279 --> 1882.2
and they will probably because he didn't

1880.1 --> 1884.1789999999999
play my explanation part and all that

1882.2 --> 1888.2
they will probably check out the video

1884.179 --> 1890.6000000000001
they will take a look and see like hey

1888.2 --> 1892.5800000000002
that's actually a really good concise

1890.6 --> 1895.76
explanation

1892.58 --> 1896.96
I never realized that yeah it does make

1895.76 --> 1900.62
sense

1896.96 --> 1903.799
as a cons as a concept and in the other

1900.62 --> 1905.9599999999998
format too the pendulum Earth format

1903.799 --> 1909.2
yeah that also kind of makes sense yeah

1905.96 --> 1912.44
because I make sense I know how this

1909.2 --> 1915.02
works I have a really high talent for

1912.44 --> 1917.559
this specifically it's like my one

1915.02 --> 1921.1
special boy skill that I'm like

1917.559 --> 1921.1
unusually good at

1923.12 --> 1925.779
okay

1926.72 --> 1933.44
I make sense of things quickly concisely

1930.44 --> 1933.44
durably

1933.679 --> 1940.46
you understand durably so when I do my

1938.419 --> 1942.919
thing and I come to this

1940.46 --> 1948.88
conclusion that's all rounded out guess

1942.919 --> 1952.539
what yeah in 10 years it'll still work

1948.88 --> 1952.5390000000002
as it has

1953.36 --> 1958.8799999999999
because if I don't come to a definitive

1956.179 --> 1962.0590000000002
conclusion then I don't do that because

1958.88 --> 1963.74
it's open-ended I don't fake like I know

1962.059 --> 1966.3799999999999
the conclusion

1963.74 --> 1968.24
because yeah then what if you praise

1966.38 --> 1970.46
yourself about how you know it other

1968.24 --> 1972.559
people might take it not take it then

1970.46 --> 1974.3600000000001
you separate yourself

1972.559 --> 1976.46
and then all of a sudden what if

1974.36 --> 1979.34
somebody actually can

1976.46 --> 1982.8990000000001
legitimately disprove it

1979.34 --> 1982.899
well then you have nothing

1983.12 --> 1988.2199999999998
except for defending all all your

1986.12 --> 1990.26
doubling down that you've done like you

1988.22 --> 1992.299
know it is real

1990.26 --> 1995.0
until I'm not doing that

1992.299 --> 1997.519
I only do that with things where I know

1995.0 --> 1999.799
like this is definitive like relative

1997.519 --> 2001.96
density

1999.799 --> 2005.9189999999999
is scientific

2001.96 --> 2008.799
that's a definitive and advanced

2005.919 --> 2010.8400000000001
relative density mechanics which isn't

2008.799 --> 2013.059
scientific technically or maybe you

2010.84 --> 2015.399
could get it to be scientific it doesn't

2013.059 --> 2018.6399999999999
really matter to me what matters is is

2015.399 --> 2023.26
that the mechanics of it work absolutely

2018.64 --> 2026.519
perfectly and are a durable system for

2023.26 --> 2026.519
the rest of time

2027.279 --> 2032.08
fact

2029.44 --> 2034.1200000000001
and you can look back at 10 years or 20

2032.08 --> 2037.0
years about maybe you'll barely even

2034.12 --> 2040.6
remember me but well what you will feel

2037.0 --> 2043.84
is like yeah yeah then

2040.6 --> 2047.4399999999998
like Advanced maneuvering mechanics yeah

2043.84 --> 2050.919
I mean it all works so exactly because

2047.44 --> 2053.26
of Advanced relative density formula

2050.919 --> 2056.2599999999998
it might not even be attributed to my

2053.26 --> 2058.0
name it'll just be some flunky on the

2056.26 --> 2060.8790000000004
University that just

2058.0 --> 2063.639
stole the credit when it's okay right

2060.879 --> 2065.679
because that's what they do

2063.639 --> 2068.7400000000002
but some of you might remember that I

2065.679 --> 2071.879
was the one that first laid it down like

2068.74 --> 2071.879
decades ago

2083.139 --> 2085.8
what

2092.08 --> 2096.24
oh my God what the [ __ ] is this

2099.46 --> 2104.619
density gradient

2101.88 --> 2108.119
yeah but what does that have to do with

2104.619 --> 2108.119
anything can voice

2108.339 --> 2113.619
so there is an observed phenomenon yeah

2111.46 --> 2116.02
but you're not very manipulating that

2113.619 --> 2117.6400000000003
phenomenon though

2116.02 --> 2119.68
and just because you see something

2117.64 --> 2121.96
doesn't mean that you can actually very

2119.68 --> 2124.0
manipulate it

2121.96 --> 2126.099
yeah you don't have to get so hostile

2124.0 --> 2128.8
and AD homie

2126.099 --> 2130.48
you [ __ ] Nutter yeah

2128.8 --> 2132.1600000000003
don't do that

2130.48 --> 2134.7400000000002
just makes you look really [ __ ]

2132.16 --> 2139.18
stupid because I know what I'm talking

2134.74 --> 2141.839
about Dell has absolutely zero

2139.18 --> 2145.839
Trace

2141.839 --> 2145.839
0.000 infinitum

2146.339 --> 2150.96
points that hold up

2148.9 --> 2154.48
yeah zero

2150.96 --> 2157.119
absolute zero has not made one statement

2154.48 --> 2162.099
in relation to his stupid upward moving

2157.119 --> 2166.06
earth that is held up not a single point

2162.099 --> 2169.119
everything has been fully roboted

2166.06 --> 2171.2799999999997
yeah go watch Nathan Oakley

2169.119 --> 2174.28
or watch Nathan Oakley when he did his

2171.28 --> 2175.48
little review about it

2174.28 --> 2177.4
yeah

2175.48 --> 2179.88
I mean I'm not even

2177.4 --> 2183.28
I don't even feel the need to go at it

2179.88 --> 2185.98
that fundamentalist that that the

2183.28 --> 2189.4
hardcore basically based on actual the

2185.98 --> 2193.359
details of science I'm just gonna go in

2189.4 --> 2196.3
and point at how the concept is

2193.359 --> 2198.7599999999998
completely in this array how his

2196.3 --> 2202.0600000000004
conception of how it should be working

2198.76 --> 2205.0
is completely broken

2202.06 --> 2206.7999999999997
yeah I find that much more worrying

2205.0 --> 2209.619
because I have a lot of conceptions

2206.8 --> 2213.2200000000003
about what could be and how things could

2209.619 --> 2217.0
be working and all that yeah but I don't

2213.22 --> 2219.5789999999997
have a broken concept of how it could be

2217.0 --> 2221.579
working that's blatantly based on

2219.579 --> 2224.98
mechanics

2221.579 --> 2228.6400000000003
that don't actually apply in the real

2224.98 --> 2230.56
world or that work blatantly different

2228.64 --> 2232.42
yeah

2230.56 --> 2235.359
motion

2232.42 --> 2237.04
doesn't create a force yeah steady

2235.359 --> 2239.56
motion doesn't do that

2237.04 --> 2241.2599999999998
doesn't doesn't yeah it's acceleration

2239.56 --> 2244.839
only

2241.26 --> 2246.28
acceleration does it only acceleration

2244.839 --> 2250.7799999999997
Alters

2246.28 --> 2253.599
the density axis within the micro medium

2250.78 --> 2256.2400000000002
of the accelerating object

2253.599 --> 2260.28
see it's only acceleration that does

2256.24 --> 2265.24
that so I'm just really

2260.28 --> 2266.98
agitated and disappointed at how utterly

2265.24 --> 2269.2
broken

2266.98 --> 2271.06
Dell's conception is

2269.2 --> 2273.16
of this realm

2271.06 --> 2275.0789999999997
I find it

2273.16 --> 2278.02
just agitating

2275.079 --> 2281.98
from a architectural point of view I

2278.02 --> 2284.02
find it agitating how wrong he is it

2281.98 --> 2285.76
does make me feel like Sean like he's

2284.02 --> 2288.7599999999998
kind of Sean Hawkins because John

2285.76 --> 2291.1600000000003
Hawkins does that too he just can't

2288.76 --> 2293.079
barely hold it together

2291.16 --> 2295.0
you can make him say things that are

2293.079 --> 2297.7200000000003
absolutely ridiculous and he won't even

2295.0 --> 2297.72
realize it

2299.68 --> 2305.64
and it seems like Dell's going that way

2301.96 --> 2305.64
so maybe it's just Dementia or something

2306.099 --> 2310.42
like you should know

2308.32 --> 2313.619
it doesn't work that way it couldn't

2310.42 --> 2313.619
work that way

2314.8 --> 2319.92
it wouldn't yield the result you're

2317.26 --> 2319.92
looking for

2322.48 --> 2331.68
okay yeah hey bro you can [ __ ] off now

2327.22 --> 2331.68
with your [ __ ] Adams [ __ ]

2331.96 --> 2337.44
bye bye [ __ ]

2334.359 --> 2337.44
back to Dell

2346.61 --> 2349.929
[Music]

2371.32 --> 2376.6600000000003
joke my reaction I don't care dude I'll

2374.14 --> 2377.98
just [ __ ] talk about him every single

2376.66 --> 2380.3799999999997
[ __ ] day

2377.98 --> 2382.3
until he stops being a [ __ ] I'll just

2380.38 --> 2383.98
do it Owen Benjamin style yeah he does

2382.3 --> 2386.079
that all the time

2383.98 --> 2389.14
I mean he's still going after Jim Bob

2386.079 --> 2391.8390000000004
because Jim Bob's still stalking him

2389.14 --> 2394.54
still trying to talk [ __ ] about him

2391.839 --> 2398.56
yeah do you think that Owen Benjamin is

2394.54 --> 2401.5
having a loss because of that no

2398.56 --> 2404.38
he's actually more popular than ever

2401.5 --> 2408.28
so hey Dell wants to do that and go

2404.38 --> 2412.1800000000003
ahead I will talk [ __ ] about you Dell

2408.28 --> 2414.6600000000003
I will talk real bad [ __ ] yeah I will

2412.18 --> 2416.98
lift that car stinky carpet of yours

2414.66 --> 2418.96
reveal what you got there

2416.98 --> 2421.06
because I've been paying attention for a

2418.96 --> 2423.16
while Dell

2421.06 --> 2425.0789999999997
and I thought that you had yourself

2423.16 --> 2427.18
under control

2425.079 --> 2431.2000000000003
but apparently you don't apparently

2427.18 --> 2434.5
you're just really eager for a fight

2431.2 --> 2438.64
well I'm not fighting you because you're

2434.5 --> 2442.079
not in the same category as mine

2438.64 --> 2442.0789999999997
and it's a waste of my time

2442.24 --> 2446.2599999999998
you want to waste your energy you're

2444.22 --> 2448.68
really good at that well I'm not gonna

2446.26 --> 2448.6800000000003
do that

2448.839 --> 2454.859
because I have better things to do

2451.96 --> 2454.859
with my energy

2455.5 --> 2460.9
but I will just straight out talk [ __ ]

2458.2 --> 2463.2999999999997
about you because you have lost my

2460.9 --> 2466.3
respect

2463.3 --> 2469.0
and it's gonna take a long time

2466.3 --> 2472.0
to get it back

2469.0 --> 2475.0
if you even try

2472.0 --> 2477.7
yeah because I did kind of respect you

2475.0 --> 2481.3
to a certain degree despite all your

2477.7 --> 2484.8999999999996
blatant shortcomings which is fine

2481.3 --> 2487.0
right if you're gonna act like this yeah

2484.9 --> 2489.7000000000003
you're gonna get it

2487.0 --> 2491.859
that means I'm gonna talk about you just

2489.7 --> 2496.18
the same category

2491.859 --> 2498.66
as I talk about Sean Hawkins or Brenda

2496.18 --> 2498.66
right

2498.94 --> 2502.839
because that's what you're categorizing

2501.28 --> 2504.28
yourself

2502.839 --> 2507.18
in

2504.28 --> 2507.1800000000003
by doing this

2518.579 --> 2526.02
say what the hell are you talking about

2521.099 --> 2526.02
Joe Rogan Benjamin what

2531.06 --> 2538.2599999999998
what the [ __ ] is that stupid Arrow

2534.76 --> 2538.26
thing what

2539.8 --> 2542.28
whatever

2550.29 --> 2553.489
[Music]

2555.93 --> 2560.0899999999997
[Music]

2562.3 --> 2567.9
anyway

2564.339 --> 2567.9
it's not really bothering me

2571.839 --> 2577.48
I know it's bothering him and that's his

2574.48 --> 2579.819
[ __ ] problem yeah yeah I'm not

2577.48 --> 2581.92
your family where you can just subtly

2579.819 --> 2583.66
start acting like a [ __ ] and then your

2581.92 --> 2586.42
family has to deal with it I know that's

2583.66 --> 2590.7
how you do it in Scotland

2586.42 --> 2590.7000000000003
but I am not your [ __ ] family

2595.839 --> 2601.72
so don't act like that to me

2598.599 --> 2603.2200000000003
can't have my friendship can have my

2601.72 --> 2605.0789999999997
respect

2603.22 --> 2607.5989999999997
you gotta

2605.079 --> 2610.3
you gotta do something for that

2607.599 --> 2612.1600000000003
that actually behave

2610.3 --> 2613.96
to get that

2612.16 --> 2616.2599999999998
if you're not behaving you ain't getting

2613.96 --> 2616.26
it

2621.4 --> 2626.04
Jim Bob

2622.66 --> 2630.1189999999997
Jim Bob is a conniving straw Manning

2626.04 --> 2630.119
religious fanatic [ __ ]

2643.96 --> 2648.599
I mean he's never personally attacked me

2649.0 --> 2653.8
so that's how far as I take I mean I'm

2651.28 --> 2655.48
not gonna like rant about him about how

2653.8 --> 2658.3590000000004
sick he is I mean I'll leave that to our

2655.48 --> 2661.839
own Benjamin he does it well enough

2658.359 --> 2663.7
what I mean oh Jim Bob never like

2661.839 --> 2665.819
started talking [ __ ] about me or

2663.7 --> 2665.819
anything

2666.7 --> 2671.98
so I'm not I don't really want to talk

2669.7 --> 2673.66
[ __ ] about him even though I have

2671.98 --> 2675.28
definitely he's definitely lost my

2673.66 --> 2677.859
respect

2675.28 --> 2681.099
by behaving like this it's really

2677.859 --> 2682.619
terrible it's unacceptably terrible it

2681.099 --> 2685.42
is a

2682.619 --> 2687.1600000000003
Grievous sign of weakness how he

2685.42 --> 2690.06
conducted himself and how he's still

2687.16 --> 2690.06
conducting himself

2694.66 --> 2697.02
right

2697.18 --> 2701.819
Jim Bob is great no no he's not great

2701.92 --> 2706.78
I mean he might be kind of entertaining

2704.68 --> 2709.66
and interesting

2706.78 --> 2711.76
but I mean

2709.66 --> 2714.5989999999997
like you can't actually have a

2711.76 --> 2714.599
discussion with him

2714.66 --> 2718.5989999999997
like about religion like he just won't

2717.4 --> 2721.48
do it

2718.599 --> 2723.88
I I was trying to get on his show

2721.48 --> 2727.119
specifically with that in mind I wanted

2723.88 --> 2728.98
to have this deeper dive into like

2727.119 --> 2731.38
mechanics of religion and I wanted to

2728.98 --> 2734.079
use his hermeneutics lore

2731.38 --> 2735.52
but he then uses it to basically forbid

2734.079 --> 2738.6400000000003
things

2735.52 --> 2741.64
and and like there's excuses in there

2738.64 --> 2744.16
it's like oh you hit that door

2741.64 --> 2748.839
with what you said so now I can just say

2744.16 --> 2751.06
no oh this this certain figure said that

2748.839 --> 2753.22
and so we don't have to address it it's

2751.06 --> 2757.02
it's like politics it's a complete

2753.22 --> 2759.5789999999997
[ __ ] waste of time you learn nothing

2757.02 --> 2761.2
discussing religion with him absolutely

2759.579 --> 2764.619
nothing

2761.2 --> 2768.72
it's just a stupid religious politics

2764.619 --> 2768.7200000000003
it's a [ __ ] waste of time

2769.599 --> 2773.099
yeah and it gets boring

2797.02 --> 2800.7599999999998
yeah that's right more colored

2801.64 --> 2805.7799999999997
all right

2803.319 --> 2807.819
it's not about that with a lot of people

2805.78 --> 2809.079
it's not about the complexity of

2807.819 --> 2812.619
something they're learning it's about

2809.079 --> 2815.319
how do they store this data

2812.619 --> 2816.94
and if they can't fit it in any place

2815.319 --> 2818.92
close to their heart then they just

2816.94 --> 2822.88
don't remember it

2818.92 --> 2827.02
in a way I kind of work like that

2822.88 --> 2831.6600000000003
and I can assimilate like immensely

2827.02 --> 2835.599
complex things at a like lightning speed

2831.66 --> 2838.42
but only if there's room

2835.599 --> 2841.54
like I will face really complicated

2838.42 --> 2843.2200000000003
things or situations

2841.54 --> 2845.38
that are told to me that I'm not even

2843.22 --> 2848.4399999999996
involved with and I really like like

2845.38 --> 2850.1800000000003
yes I can get this but I don't have room

2848.44 --> 2853.48
for this

2850.18 --> 2855.339
and then at later point

2853.48 --> 2860.16
I will

2855.339 --> 2860.16
and then suddenly I just get it

2863.079 --> 2866.92
yeah moxie

2864.7 --> 2870.48
shut the [ __ ] up don't talk to Bobby

2866.92 --> 2870.48
you're getting a timeout

2873.28 --> 2877.5600000000004
never talk to him

2877.66 --> 2882.839
say his name

2879.16 --> 2882.839
one time you get a timeout

2887.8 --> 2892.599
nobody cares who he is all that matters

2890.319 --> 2896.52
is that if you see that name

2892.599 --> 2896.52
you ban him immediately

2897.94 --> 2901.14
it's all you need to know

2932.32 --> 2935.539
[Music]

2951.72 --> 2955.0789999999997
he isn't

2958.599 --> 2963.46
Sean isn't

2960.46 --> 2965.7400000000002
yeah I mean you might pop up and then he

2963.46 --> 2968.2
gets kicked out again but I mean it

2965.74 --> 2969.9399999999996
doesn't matter it doesn't matter stop

2968.2 --> 2973.06
asking who that is

2969.94 --> 2976.3
just know he gets banned

2973.06 --> 2979.0789999999997
just just know he gets banned no

2976.3 --> 2979.079
questions asked

2980.44 --> 2983.68
huh

2981.7 --> 2985.1189999999997
I mean as [ __ ] hundreds of soccer

2983.68 --> 2988.54
counts

2985.119 --> 2993.359
and you just ban him immediately

2988.54 --> 2993.359
immediately no questions asked

3012.78 --> 3016.659
[Music]

3032.15 --> 3036.78
[Music]

3033.42 --> 3040.92
a Greek I have the Centric Orthodox

3036.78 --> 3044.1600000000003
Russian prefer well

3040.92 --> 3047.7200000000003
whatever they're both a waste of time

3044.16 --> 3047.72
it's all a waste of time

3048.599 --> 3051.8
they're all broken

3051.9 --> 3057.9
all of them they're all broken by men

3055.859 --> 3060.7799999999997
yeah

3057.9 --> 3062.46
nobody has the original

3060.78 --> 3065.099
Christ

3062.46 --> 3067.619
teachings

3065.099 --> 3069.92
before the Council of nicaea nobody has

3067.619 --> 3069.92
those

3069.96 --> 3075.359
and all the differences is that these

3073.02 --> 3078.059
other churches did just take that same

3075.359 --> 3081.0
book that's not the original it's been

3078.059 --> 3083.4
like highly worked on

3081.0 --> 3086.46
by all kinds of types including

3083.4 --> 3088.319
Pharisees I'm pretty damn sure all of it

3086.46 --> 3090.48
they all came together and they wrote

3088.319 --> 3092.2799999999997
this book that's not the original works

3090.48 --> 3094.319
of Christ

3092.28 --> 3098.099
of Jesus

3094.319 --> 3101.4
and oh well our church is really early

3098.099 --> 3103.619
in not letting it corrupt any further

3101.4 --> 3105.96
like the Catholics

3103.619 --> 3109.88
congratulations

3105.96 --> 3113.16
you're following a religion that's

3109.88 --> 3116.94
not that is literally not based on the

3113.16 --> 3118.7999999999997
original and you let it corrupt a little

3116.94 --> 3122.119
bit slower but I mean the corruption

3118.8 --> 3122.119
still blatantly there

3122.76 --> 3129.119
her manuetics really you're you're gonna

3125.76 --> 3130.8590000000004
let Hermes determine for you how to

3129.119 --> 3133.2000000000003
interpret

3130.859 --> 3135.24
that book

3133.2 --> 3138.54
I'm gonna let somebody else do it yeah

3135.24 --> 3141.4799999999996
it's so [ __ ] all of it is [ __ ]

3138.54 --> 3144.98
and all leads to gamma horde all of it

3141.48 --> 3144.98
it's all [ __ ]

3150.559 --> 3155.8190000000004
what did I say Amy yes

3153.359 --> 3161.42
what did I say

3155.819 --> 3161.42
told you not to address him

3162.839 --> 3168.72
the next person who addresses him in any

3166.319 --> 3172.4
way gets banned

3168.72 --> 3172.3999999999996
do I make myself clear

3179.88 --> 3184.98
yeah

3181.92 --> 3186.119
the next person that says his name gets

3184.98 --> 3188.22
banned

3186.119 --> 3190.92
like this [ __ ] who is a soccer count

3188.22 --> 3193.14
of that same guy so you don't talk about

3190.92 --> 3196.859
him you don't mention him you don't

3193.14 --> 3199.6189999999997
[ __ ] laugh about him

3196.859 --> 3203.42
just carry on

3199.619 --> 3205.44
I see a single person address anything

3203.42 --> 3209.64
concerning him

3205.44 --> 3212.7200000000003
again I will ban you wrench or not

3209.64 --> 3212.72

3232.079 --> 3238.8
that's right beautiful day indeed

3236.28 --> 3240.7400000000002
it's much more of a worthy talk I'd

3238.8 --> 3242.819
rather talk about the weather

3240.74 --> 3245.8999999999996
for an hour

3242.819 --> 3245.9
that would be great

3247.74 --> 3251.54
oh look at how beautiful that is

3259.2 --> 3266.0589999999997
yeah don't talk about it just move on

3263.04 --> 3266.0589999999997
doesn't exist

3266.76 --> 3269.5400000000004
that's right

3270.68 --> 3276.14
beautiful Dutch Skies no trails

3276.3 --> 3280.3

wind

3280.3 --> 3283.55
[Music]

3290.339 --> 3296.96

yourself just

3297.48 --> 3302.839
huh well done more colored that was

3300.66 --> 3302.839
quick

3323.64 --> 3329.64
yeah and I keep typing those sentences

3326.24 --> 3333.18
because of this stupid icon that gets in

3329.64 --> 3337.0989999999997
the way there it's the worst

3333.18 --> 3339.8999999999996
it is like it is literally

3337.099 --> 3342.2400000000002
obstructing the proper functioning of it

3339.9 --> 3343.4
of the live chat

3342.24 --> 3345.14
yeah

3343.4 --> 3349.38
whoever

3345.14 --> 3353.16
implemented that [ __ ] thing should be

3349.38 --> 3353.1600000000003
fired immediately

3365.82 --> 3371.579
[Music]

3367.4 --> 3375.0
you want some stupid button or whatever

3371.579 --> 3378.1800000000003
then you should have placed it in the

3375.0 --> 3379.46
chat box and not right above it right in

3378.18 --> 3382.6189999999997
front of

3379.46 --> 3383.16
the thing that moderators use to

3382.619 --> 3385.5
moderate

3383.16 --> 3389.5789999999997
[Music]

3385.5 --> 3393.059
it is literally like one of the worst

3389.579 --> 3395.46
like interface applications in in social

3393.059 --> 3399.0
media that have ever seen that person

3395.46 --> 3402.359
that made that decision

3399.0 --> 3405.72
that made it like that should be fired

3402.359 --> 3408.42
from YouTube programmers whatever that

3405.72 --> 3412.16
is immediately

3408.42 --> 3412.16
fired immediately

3418.44 --> 3424.46
an ad blocker gets rid of it that's cool

3420.9 --> 3424.46
or could you get rid of that

3424.68 --> 3428.24
could you help me out there mark

3428.4 --> 3432.6600000000003
oh never mind

3430.38 --> 3434.46
because as long as yeah if somebody says

3432.66 --> 3436.3799999999997
something immediately after then I can

3434.46 --> 3437.59
reach it

3436.38 --> 3440.739
anyway

3437.59 --> 3440.739
[Music]

3441.119 --> 3446.28
remember

3444.119 --> 3447.78
nobody's here you don't talk about it

3446.28 --> 3450.6600000000003
you don't mention his name you don't

3447.78 --> 3452.0400000000004
talk about the activity in any way or

3450.66 --> 3455.18
anything you said

3452.04 --> 3455.18
just doesn't exist

3473.94 --> 3478.8
yeah man I've seen that into the break

3476.28 --> 3481.5
like those new fires in Canada are

3478.8 --> 3483.54
that's crazy

3481.5 --> 3485.88
I mean

3483.54 --> 3488.18
there's something really bad going on

3485.88 --> 3488.1800000000003
there

3498.24 --> 3503.339
I think that Trudeau is literally gonna

3500.64 --> 3506.7599999999998
burn down the entire country

3503.339 --> 3510.24
and he's gonna do it and every Canadian

3506.76 --> 3512.46
will literally die and burn to death and

3510.24 --> 3515.819
commit suicide because they're all too

3512.46 --> 3519.0
[ __ ] weak they're too weak they don't

3515.819 --> 3520.2599999999998
deserve their country they don't deserve

3519.0 --> 3522.18
their country

3520.26 --> 3523.98
because for everything that the Prime

3522.18 --> 3526.44
Minister there has done

3523.98 --> 3529.44
all of those people should be arrested

3526.44 --> 3532.26
and executed

3529.44 --> 3534.42
straight out Bullet to the back of the

3532.26 --> 3538.1400000000003
head in a ditch

3534.42 --> 3540.96
in a shallow grave quickly

3538.14 --> 3542.64
and the Canadians are too [ __ ] weak

3540.96 --> 3545.46
to do that they're more concerned about

3542.64 --> 3548.46
no we have to protect the gays well then

3545.46 --> 3548.46
die

3561.92 --> 3568.9300000000003

3573.839 --> 3583.14
yeah they're all going to burn to death

3578.28 --> 3585.1800000000003
with what I've seen it's so extreme it's

3583.14 --> 3589.0789999999997
Trudeau is not gonna stop he's gonna

3585.18 --> 3592.02
literally kill every single inhabitant

3589.079 --> 3593.96
of Canada every single one he's gonna go

3592.02 --> 3596.28
for the full genocide

3593.96 --> 3598.2

3596.28 --> 3601.8590000000004
he's not going to stop

3598.2 --> 3606.0589999999997
till every single last Canadian is dead

3601.859 --> 3608.5989999999997
and they will all let it happen

3606.059 --> 3608.599
yeah

3608.88 --> 3613.98
I mean the only Canadians that are going

3612.059 --> 3615.7200000000003
to survive this are maybe a couple of

3613.98 --> 3617.64
soldiers that have been stationed

3615.72 --> 3619.5
somewhere abroad or something

3617.64 --> 3621.42
part of some joined force and then where

3619.5 --> 3623.4
the array we return

3621.42 --> 3626.1800000000003
they'll notice there's nothing to return

3623.4 --> 3630.119
to because everything has burned down

3626.18 --> 3632.04
everything will be destroyed

3630.119 --> 3633.54
like this cities too you think that

3632.04 --> 3635.7599999999998
they're going to spare the cities no no

3633.54 --> 3638.16
they're going to be torched too

3635.76 --> 3641.579
people in it everything

3638.16 --> 3644.339
it's going to burn everything down

3641.579 --> 3646.02
it's all just gonna happen and

3644.339 --> 3649.2
everybody's gonna sit there and they're

3646.02 --> 3651.54
all gonna pray or they're gonna be oh

3649.2 --> 3654.72
maybe government will save us and they

3651.54 --> 3657.72
are all going to die

3654.72 --> 3657.72
foreign

3659.42 --> 3665.1800000000003
say goodbye to Canada you're all dead

3665.819 --> 3669.2
yes all of you

3671.04 --> 3675.18
because you're gonna let him do that

3673.619 --> 3676.92
you're gonna just let him sit there

3675.18 --> 3680.0989999999997
you're gonna let him

3676.92 --> 3682.98
roll out policies you're gonna let him

3680.099 --> 3685.2000000000003
build systems to keep doing this yeah

3682.98 --> 3686.7
he's got a Ponzi scheme going it's like

3685.2 --> 3691.52
hey

3686.7 --> 3691.52
do what I say or I burn everything down

3693.599 --> 3699.329
openly

3694.66 --> 3699.3289999999997
[Music]

3699.839 --> 3704.88
right you're gonna give him dictatorial

3702.72 --> 3708.48
laws

3704.88 --> 3712.7400000000002
about what you're allowed to breathe

3708.48 --> 3714.78
or climate change will destroy you all

3712.74 --> 3716.22
and subtly fires will just start

3714.78 --> 3718.5
igniting

3716.22 --> 3722.4599999999996
just like that and we'll burn everything

3718.5 --> 3724.98
down yeah and you're all going to sit

3722.46 --> 3727.619
there and let it happen

3724.98 --> 3730.38
all going to burn

3727.619 --> 3733.079
say goodbye to your country say goodbye

3730.38 --> 3736.7000000000003
to the woods it's all going to burn down

3733.079 --> 3736.7000000000003
people houses

3736.92 --> 3740.88
yeah supermarkets

3741.0 --> 3747.42
forest all of it animals everything

3744.319 --> 3749.88
everything it's all going to burn to the

3747.42 --> 3753.2400000000002
ground nothing will be Left Alive

3749.88 --> 3755.819
because you're going to sit there

3753.24 --> 3759.359
and let him do all that blatantly

3755.819 --> 3762.48
blatantly investing your resources into

3759.359 --> 3765.18
the overt destruction of your country

3762.48 --> 3767.04
through direct assault

3765.18 --> 3768.66
are you gonna let him do that and you're

3767.04 --> 3770.52
gonna let him keep doing that and

3768.66 --> 3774.44
nobody's gonna stick out an arm because

3770.52 --> 3774.44
you all want to die

3780.9 --> 3783.26
yeah

3783.66 --> 3791.339
and hey I mean I expect my country to

3787.38 --> 3794.099
basically catch fire all of a sudden

3791.339 --> 3796.799
because we seem to be sort of the same

3794.099 --> 3799.6800000000003
maybe a little less

3796.799 --> 3802.079
I mean we got plenty of like animosity

3799.68 --> 3804.8999999999996
there's people that literally on

3802.079 --> 3806.46
principle say no even in business and

3804.9 --> 3809.28
that's probably the reason why we

3806.46 --> 3812.099
haven't caught on fire yet here in the

3809.28 --> 3814.619
Netherlands despite the rampant amount

3812.099 --> 3819.619
of gays

3814.619 --> 3819.619
that are really bad bad types

3822.2 --> 3826.6189999999997
they're all deluded they all think they

3824.819 --> 3828.96
are doing the right thing

3826.619 --> 3831.319
and they all think that just break down

3828.96 --> 3831.319
everything

3831.599 --> 3835.5
that's what they do break down

3833.579 --> 3837.6600000000003
everything break down all principles

3835.5 --> 3840.119
break down all sources

3837.66 --> 3843.1189999999997
families

3840.119 --> 3844.859
normal human behavior

3843.119 --> 3848.2200000000003
and that's what gets you to that place

3844.859 --> 3851.339
yeah because you know you're you are not

3848.22 --> 3854.339
like that or oh we're too Christian to

3851.339 --> 3856.02
get violent or no you just don't do

3854.339 --> 3860.16
anything about it whatever excuse you

3856.02 --> 3862.2
need and now in Canada

3860.16 --> 3864.859
it's a final drop and now you're all

3862.2 --> 3864.859
going to burn

3865.02 --> 3868.5
bit by bit

3866.579 --> 3871.799
it's all going to burn down just gonna

3868.5 --> 3874.14
keep setting places on fire

3871.799 --> 3876.359
you're probably gonna have a few molten

3874.14 --> 3878.04
cities just like in California remember

3876.359 --> 3879.9
that

3878.04 --> 3881.88
it's just these Villages where just the

3879.9 --> 3884.04
entire place and cars just get

3881.88 --> 3886.859
completely melted

3884.04 --> 3889.94
totally disintegrated you're probably

3886.859 --> 3889.94
gonna find that too

3890.94 --> 3896.16
yeah molten cities

3893.04 --> 3897.839
well the city is a big words probably I

3896.16 --> 3898.74
don't know if they have enough power to

3897.839 --> 3901.5
like

3898.74 --> 3902.4599999999996
literally melt a giant steel frame

3901.5 --> 3905.46
building

3902.46 --> 3910.02
but they definitely have enough power

3905.46 --> 3911.2200000000003
to mail a car to like a pool of metal

3910.02 --> 3913.799
so

3911.22 --> 3915.8999999999996
that's been happening in in California a

3913.799 --> 3918.24
while back years back it was all this

3915.9 --> 3920.52
footage it's a crazy mystery ugh

3918.24 --> 3924.4799999999996
directed energy weapons yeah yeah guess

3920.52 --> 3927.599
what's happening in Canada right now

3924.48 --> 3929.16
massive simultaneous fires

3927.599 --> 3931.799
twice

3929.16 --> 3934.319
twice within a span of a few months

3931.799 --> 3936.359
climate change yeah there's no climate

3934.319 --> 3937.859
circumstances that could ever possibly

3936.359 --> 3940.38
make that happen

3937.859 --> 3944.5989999999997
that never happens that's never happened

3940.38 --> 3944.599
and it never will happen naturally

3948.26 --> 3951.96
church-going Canadians yeah and they're

3950.28 --> 3955.44
all [ __ ] weakened and let all the

3951.96 --> 3957.42
gays in their church and they basically

3955.44 --> 3959.76
they're not Christianity they're like

3957.42 --> 3962.04
the Pinnacle of corrupted Christianity

3959.76 --> 3965.6400000000003
yeah if you're a Christian and you allow

3962.04 --> 3969.299
all this lgbtq crap and the flag and

3965.64 --> 3972.24
trans people and oh it's okay to be yeah

3969.299 --> 3976.38
if you allow that then you are like the

3972.24 --> 3981.1189999999997
Pinnacle of corrupted Christianity

3976.38 --> 3982.799
yeah Sodom and Gomorrah don't merge

3981.119 --> 3985.02
with Christ

3982.799 --> 3987.839
and that's what you're trying to do yeah

3985.02 --> 3990.9
you're creating an Alchemy a chemistry

3987.839 --> 3992.52
that only leads into absolute

3990.9 --> 3996.319
destruction

3992.52 --> 3996.319
you're just stupid to see that

3997.26 --> 4000.76
and so you will burn

4012.079 --> 4015.079
foreign

4017.92 --> 4020.98
I know

4023.42 --> 4026.5190000000002
[Music]

4044.059 --> 4048.88
right anyway that's enough of the Wrath

4048.98 --> 4053.14
I just wanted to emphasize that a bit

4053.299 --> 4057.46
because of a certain Big Year

4060.14 --> 4066.52
yeah but I mean it is pretty [ __ ] up

4063.799 --> 4066.52
in Canada

4066.619 --> 4071.42
and I do absolutely feel it directly the

4069.619 --> 4073.7000000000003
government I mean this government that

4071.42 --> 4076.339
you got is like lit it's the most

4073.7 --> 4077.5389999999998
Marxist [ __ ] government I've ever

4076.339 --> 4080.0589999999997
seen

4077.539 --> 4082.3590000000004
they are literally trying to kill

4080.059 --> 4082.3590000000004
everybody

4084.5 --> 4092.14
and they're making work of it guys

4087.14 --> 4092.14
they're making work of actually doing it

4092.839 --> 4098.7789999999995
I don't understand why these Canadians

4095.96 --> 4100.52
are still holding on to this feeble

4098.779 --> 4103.64
notion of

4100.52 --> 4106.279
of your civilization when the one that

4103.64 --> 4109.219
is in control is literally unrolling

4106.279 --> 4111.38
extermination

4109.219 --> 4113.12
I mean it's worse than Hitler yeah

4111.38 --> 4116.54
Hitler didn't

4113.12 --> 4120.08
plan to externally actively exterminate

4116.54 --> 4123.219
everybody in the country yeah unlike

4120.08 --> 4123.219
your president

4125.779 --> 4128.38
all right

4132.44 --> 4136.219
so why are you just letting all that

4134.839 --> 4138.04
happen you think you're gonna get some

4136.219 --> 4140.42
reward for letting all that happen

4138.04 --> 4142.59
letting it all burn down you think God's

4140.42 --> 4144.7390000000005
Gonna reward you

4142.59 --> 4147.02
[Music]

4144.739 --> 4150.94
think God's Gonna reward you for not

4147.02 --> 4150.9400000000005
engaging as everything is burned down

4150.98 --> 4156.98
you think God might reward you a little

4153.319 --> 4159.759
bit more if you actually take a risk

4156.98 --> 4163.718999999999
and do something about it

4159.759 --> 4167.299
adorable action that requires sacrifice

4163.719 --> 4169.339
and the sacrifice of comfort and of even

4167.299 --> 4171.62
feeling good about yourself

4169.339 --> 4174.739
but that's so much more important isn't

4171.62 --> 4176.599999999999
it to you to all of you

4174.739 --> 4179.419999999999
you just want to feel good about

4176.6 --> 4182.679
yourself you want to just be good as you

4179.42 --> 4185.42
die as as literally the devil

4182.679 --> 4186.92
annihilates you all

4185.42 --> 4189.799
you'd rather

4186.92 --> 4192.859
do that be the right Christian and just

4189.799 --> 4197.6
die with a pure heart yeah yeah go and

4192.859 --> 4200.120000000001
die with a pure heart burn

4197.6 --> 4202.219
with a pure heart do it

4200.12 --> 4205.76
yeah or

4202.219 --> 4212.2390000000005
you could actually be a little pragmatic

4205.76 --> 4216.1
for once and [ __ ] stop this [ __ ]

4212.239 --> 4216.099999999999
get brutal

4216.8 --> 4223.6
yeah make it end force it to end with

4220.94 --> 4223.599999999999
violence

4226.82 --> 4231.98
because until you do you can just be

4229.34 --> 4232.9400000000005
really angry and threatening from a

4231.98 --> 4235.82
distance

4232.94 --> 4238.159
while they use weapons that they built

4235.82 --> 4243.34
with your tax money

4238.159 --> 4243.339999999999
to literally burn you down

4282.94 --> 4287.78
right and by the way I don't think like

4285.92 --> 4289.76
my country is not escaping destruction

4287.78 --> 4292.46
either I mean your country seems to be

4289.76 --> 4294.4400000000005
literally burning in Canada

4292.46 --> 4297.46
France is also getting it they're

4294.44 --> 4297.46
literally getting

4299.08 --> 4307.54
foreigners with automatic weapons just

4303.5 --> 4310.159
literally just going around and

4307.54 --> 4312.679
vandalizing everything and and just

4310.159 --> 4314.12
murdering people out in the street and

4312.679 --> 4316.9400000000005
like

4314.12 --> 4320.0199999999995
the [ __ ] up police is not doing

4316.94 --> 4320.0199999999995
anything about it

4321.14 --> 4328.4800000000005
those police officers should be thrown

4324.56 --> 4328.4800000000005
off the buildings

4328.88 --> 4334.82
yeah what they should be doing is

4331.94 --> 4339.678999999999
getting their heavy weapons

4334.82 --> 4343.639999999999
yeah machine guns mounted to buses

4339.679 --> 4345.9800000000005
then they roll in and they [ __ ] shoot

4343.64 --> 4348.14
them to pieces

4345.98 --> 4353.178999999999
yeah

4348.14 --> 4357.08
and if they then flee to a safe house

4353.179 --> 4358.64
then you literally shoot the house to

4357.08 --> 4361.219
pieces

4358.64 --> 4363.8
yeah that's what the French police

4361.219 --> 4366.02
should be doing but they're not doing

4363.8 --> 4368.96
that because they're [ __ ] weak and so

4366.02 --> 4370.040000000001
they should be thrown off a building

4368.96 --> 4375.04
okay

4370.04 --> 4375.04
for being weak ass [ __ ]

4375.58 --> 4380.54
foreign

4377.98 --> 4384.08
because what they should be doing is

4380.54 --> 4386.54
[ __ ] shooting these Invaders to death

4384.08 --> 4388.28
they're literally using machine guns

4386.54 --> 4389.9
they shouldn't even be having them yeah

4388.28 --> 4392.3
what the police should be doing is

4389.9 --> 4394.94
[ __ ] snipe those pieces of [ __ ] to

4392.3 --> 4398.6
death then take those machine guns and

4394.94 --> 4402.28
use those machine guns to Kill Them All

4398.6 --> 4402.280000000001
that's what they should be doing

4409.04 --> 4412.76
the Netherlands is also getting it in

4411.14 --> 4414.92
another way because of the Netherlands I

4412.76 --> 4416.2390000000005
mean this [ __ ] government I mean yeah

4414.92 --> 4419.0
we're good and then we're getting them

4416.239 --> 4419.9
in the meantime it's like every [ __ ]

4419.0 --> 4423.02
week

4419.9 --> 4426.5599999999995
every week they're these same [ __ ] up

4423.02 --> 4429.9800000000005
people despite them we want to ask them

4426.56 --> 4433.46
they're like spending a billion dollars

4429.98 --> 4435.799999999999
every [ __ ] weekend on some complete

4433.46 --> 4438.44
hard [ __ ]

4435.8 --> 4440.78
giving it to Ukraine or giving it to

4438.44 --> 4441.98
some climate fund literally they are

4440.78 --> 4443.84
like

4441.98 --> 4446.839999999999
I think that the Netherlands is going to

4443.84 --> 4449.4800000000005
be so extremely bankrupt at the end of

4446.84 --> 4451.219
this ride that we might become one of

4449.48 --> 4452.839999999999
the poorest countries in the world I'm

4451.219 --> 4454.46
not even joking I think they're

4452.84 --> 4456.26
literally trying to do that as a

4454.46 --> 4458.719
punishment

4456.26 --> 4461.179
for our weakness

4458.719 --> 4462.9800000000005
for us being so rich well I think that

4461.179 --> 4465.7390000000005
the Netherlands might end up one of the

4462.98 --> 4466.879999999999
poorest countries in the world at the

4465.739 --> 4469.28
end of this ride

4466.88 --> 4471.4400000000005
we'll still be alive but we'll be poor

4469.28 --> 4474.0199999999995
as [ __ ] I mean Canada everybody's just

4471.44 --> 4475.94
dead and in France

4474.02 --> 4477.860000000001
well France is going to be off the best

4475.94 --> 4479.9
in the end I mean it's going to be a

4477.86 --> 4482.12
kind of a third world hello but they

4479.9 --> 4484.719
will have Sharia law it will they will

4482.12 --> 4484.719
at least

4484.88 --> 4487.719
do that

4491.6 --> 4497.360000000001
but this country is just it's going to

4494.42 --> 4500.0
be like communist hellhole

4497.36 --> 4504.4
where where literally it's gonna be that

4500.0 --> 4504.4
time where you're gonna have to roll in

4505.159 --> 4510.86
roll in like a

4507.26 --> 4513.7390000000005
a wagon full of bills of money just to

4510.86 --> 4516.4
get a loaf of bread I mean it's coming

4513.739 --> 4516.4
it's coming

4517.52 --> 4522.56
it's coming here because

4519.679 --> 4524.659
we're becoming really [ __ ] poor

4522.56 --> 4526.52
because all the resources everything we

4524.659 --> 4530.78
had everything that was built up it's

4526.52 --> 4532.219
all being grabbed away being grasped out

4530.78 --> 4533.719
of her hands everything is getting

4532.219 --> 4537.08
destroyed everything is just being

4533.719 --> 4541.82
gifted to blatant war criminals

4537.08 --> 4544.159
and other anti-national parasitic funds

4541.82 --> 4546.739
that are Eugenics based and really

4544.159 --> 4549.44
strive just to extermine it you could

4546.739 --> 4552.5599999999995
argue that our money is probably being

4549.44 --> 4554.178999999999
gifted to Trudeau to build weapons to

4552.56 --> 4557.3
literally murder you

4554.179 --> 4559.52
so you're welcome

4557.3 --> 4561.08
it's probably partially being done with

4559.52 --> 4563.0
money that's being stolen from us

4561.08 --> 4565.159
because I'm pretty sure that any any

4563.0 --> 4567.26
money that goes into a climate fund at

4565.159 --> 4570.92
this point is being used

4567.26 --> 4574.76
to build weapons

4570.92 --> 4578.2390000000005
to literally cause disasters with that

4574.76 --> 4581.6
can be used to black male people into

4578.239 --> 4583.04
playing into paying climate tax I I

4581.6 --> 4585.9400000000005
think that's literally what they're

4583.04 --> 4585.94
doing with that money

4588.08 --> 4593.48
yeah they're building weapons

4590.659 --> 4596.78
that they can use to Blackmail the

4593.48 --> 4599.9
public into paying climate tax

4596.78 --> 4603.32
they will literally cause disasters with

4599.9 --> 4606.379999999999
man-made devices specifically

4603.32 --> 4609.04
to brutalize the people

4606.38 --> 4612.02
and Bully them into paying a

4609.04 --> 4615.4
unconditional climate tax

4612.02 --> 4615.400000000001
I think that's what's happening

4623.32 --> 4626.41
[Music]

4646.83 --> 4650.979
[Music]

4655.76 --> 4658.819
[Music]

4666.92 --> 4674.649
[Music]

4678.86 --> 4689.37
[Music]

4706.07 --> 4710.25
[Music]

4715.219 --> 4719.2390000000005
yes nukes are Obsolete and they don't

4717.679 --> 4721.58
exist anyway

4719.239 --> 4724.159
it was always fire bombs and they'll

4721.58 --> 4726.199
have much more efficient ways to to drop

4724.159 --> 4728.48
fire bombs

4726.199 --> 4731.599999999999
instead of planes dropping a bunch of

4728.48 --> 4735.919999999999
things like that they could yeah send a

4731.6 --> 4738.1990000000005
drone swarm out that each like send out

4735.92 --> 4739.64
a million drones with each like a

4738.199 --> 4743.178999999999
fireball

4739.64 --> 4746.12
that could like Precision drop it to

4743.179 --> 4749.62
literally level

4746.12 --> 4749.62
a very large area

4751.34 --> 4755.38
yes of course it's all possible

4759.87 --> 4762.97
[Music]

4770.0 --> 4774.94
taking away your cool Oven Pizza wow

4777.8 --> 4783.1990000000005
right well like ABS I I don't know why

4781.1 --> 4784.88
Canadians at this point aren't just like

4783.199 --> 4788.12
Hey we're not gonna do what you're

4784.88 --> 4789.9800000000005
saying anymore like if you send over

4788.12 --> 4793.46
police

4789.98 --> 4795.259999999999
SWAT or military we will literally start

4793.46 --> 4797.6
shooting back

4795.26 --> 4801.4400000000005
yeah that's what Canada requires right

4797.6 --> 4803.719
now a total militant Revolt with any

4801.44 --> 4806.12
weapons you got left

4803.719 --> 4810.26
total militant Revolt just say like

4806.12 --> 4812.719
we're not going to do any changes

4810.26 --> 4816.62
and we're actually gonna roll back the

4812.719 --> 4818.659
changes and do that [ __ ] all of you [ __ ]

4816.62 --> 4821.0
you government

4818.659 --> 4823.099999999999
you want us to change it

4821.0 --> 4825.56
you want to send us to jail because we

4823.1 --> 4827.9800000000005
don't apply come and get us we will fire

4825.56 --> 4827.9800000000005
back

4830.48 --> 4837.08
it's the last chance it's your last

4832.94 --> 4839.98
chance Canada last chance after this

4837.08 --> 4839.98
you're all dead

4842.06 --> 4847.6
there will be nobody left to be able to

4844.64 --> 4847.6
stand up and resist

4863.6 --> 4869.42
yeah if you find any [ __ ] snitchy

4866.42 --> 4872.0
government snitch people you better just

4869.42 --> 4874.4
[ __ ] shoot them through the head too

4872.0 --> 4876.02
once you start doing that because they

4874.4 --> 4878.0599999999995
will come out of the Woodworks they will

4876.02 --> 4880.159000000001
start doing that spying and they will

4878.06 --> 4883.120000000001
you [ __ ] shoot them through the head

4880.159 --> 4883.12
you kill them

4887.42 --> 4891.9800000000005
get rid of your Traders and resist the

4891.14 --> 4895.12
government

4891.98 --> 4895.12
with Force

4895.88 --> 4899.54
right and then let's see what moves

4898.64 --> 4902.860000000001
they're going to make there's a good

4899.54 --> 4902.86
chance they won't even do anything

4903.679 --> 4908.3
right and if they then start suddenly

4905.84 --> 4911.96
torching everything

4908.3 --> 4913.76
like oh restaurant owner refuses to

4911.96 --> 4915.56
adapt to the climate rules and then

4913.76 --> 4918.4400000000005
suddenly our old place catches on fire

4915.56 --> 4921.9800000000005
well okay then it's time to March

4918.44 --> 4924.379999999999
then it's time to bring the weaponry

4921.98 --> 4927.339999999999
in their faces

4924.38 --> 4927.34
firing

4929.84 --> 4934.54
you got a good reason you're literally

4931.64 --> 4934.54
being assaulted

4935.54 --> 4940.34
right first you got to resist then it's

4938.3 --> 4943.34
like you're not gonna force me to do

4940.34 --> 4945.5
anything I will resist with force and if

4943.34 --> 4947.84
they then try that then you have your

4945.5 --> 4952.0
reason then you have your karmic reason

4947.84 --> 4952.0
to go there and [ __ ] kill them

4952.219 --> 4955.36
that's how you do it

4981.94 --> 4988.5199999999995
all right so good luck out there

4985.64 --> 4989.42
I hope anybody has any Trace memory left

4988.52 --> 4992.540000000001
of

4989.42 --> 4994.52
those amazing Generations from a from a

4992.54 --> 4996.8
century ago

4994.52 --> 4999.1990000000005
because a century ago

4996.8 --> 5001.179
somebody liked Trudeau they would be

4999.199 --> 5002.919999999999
dead now

5001.179 --> 5004.4800000000005
because there would have been men they

5002.92 --> 5006.52
would just like come out of the woods

5004.48 --> 5008.5
they wouldn't even need a weapon they'd

5006.52 --> 5009.88
just get an ax

5008.5 --> 5013.78
come out

5009.88 --> 5015.9400000000005
and they'd [ __ ] Slaughter these

5013.78 --> 5018.219
bureaucratic [ __ ] they're all [ __ ]

5015.94 --> 5020.919999999999
these people okay

5018.219 --> 5024.159
they're all weak

5020.92 --> 5026.08
they all cower in fear on the slightest

5024.159 --> 5028.36
sign of violence that's what makes this

5026.08 --> 5031.659
also incredibly

5028.36 --> 5034.239
pathetic that they will literally just

5031.659 --> 5037.299999999999
let everybody get slaughtered

5034.239 --> 5040.0
but they oh in their face do they'll

5037.3 --> 5042.54
have panic attacks for weeks

5040.0 --> 5042.54
right

5043.84 --> 5050.679
they're really weak all you need to do

5046.36 --> 5054.58
is not also be [ __ ] weak

5050.679 --> 5056.9800000000005
resist them with Force

5054.58 --> 5059.5
say no I'm not gonna do that if you're

5056.98 --> 5061.98
gonna try to make me I'll [ __ ] shoot

5059.5 --> 5061.98
you

5072.48 --> 5080.339999999999
do that and you got a starting chance

5077.26 --> 5080.34
this is start

5081.699 --> 5088.178999999999
the only real way that you can actually

5083.739 --> 5090.099999999999
just finish it is by yeah taking care of

5088.179 --> 5092.4400000000005
the entire government

5090.1 --> 5095.7390000000005
all these specific

5092.44 --> 5097.12
Affiliates that that do these things I

5095.739 --> 5099.459999999999
mean there's plenty there should be

5097.12 --> 5102.4
plenty of researches in Canada that know

5099.46 --> 5103.54
exactly what people are part of of this

5102.4 --> 5105.699
entire thing

5103.54 --> 5110.28
how they're connected

5105.699 --> 5110.28
you know you know who to Target

5114.52 --> 5119.5
right

5116.14 --> 5122.9800000000005
so you start by making a

5119.5 --> 5124.659
stance stand where you're saying I'm not

5122.98 --> 5126.28
doing what you're saying anymore if

5124.659 --> 5129.759999999999
you're gonna try to make me or send

5126.28 --> 5133.0199999999995
police after me or finds or whatever we

5129.76 --> 5133.02
will resist with Force

5142.78 --> 5146.98
right but by the way if you're gonna do

5145.0 --> 5148.9
that prepare to have a lot of resources

5146.98 --> 5151.0
because you're probably going to get cut

5148.9 --> 5153.4
off from the bank

5151.0 --> 5155.14
if you're gonna do that all those Banks

5153.4 --> 5156.94
they will just shut down if they haven't

5155.14 --> 5158.38
already shut down I don't know but you

5156.94 --> 5161.5599999999995
got to be

5158.38 --> 5163.84
you got to have some resources or really

5161.56 --> 5166.860000000001
prepared to live a very

5163.84 --> 5166.860000000001
Simple Life

5166.9 --> 5172.12
but I mean it's that or it's just or

5170.02 --> 5175.659000000001
maybe you just prefer oh but I want my

5172.12 --> 5177.639
luxuries to the last minute let all my

5175.659 --> 5179.62
country and all everything we build

5177.639 --> 5180.58
everything we were let it all burn to

5179.62 --> 5183.46
death

5180.58 --> 5186.5199999999995
but at least I will be able to eat steak

5183.46 --> 5188.92
on my last day

5186.52 --> 5190.06
before it all is gone and there is no

5188.92 --> 5192.04
mistake

5190.06 --> 5196.1990000000005
now if you're gonna live like that then

5192.04 --> 5196.199
yeah burn to death you deserve it

5209.17 --> 5212.34
[Music]

5216.28 --> 5220.3

uh Maxima probably because they don't

5240.46 --> 5247.84
really give a [ __ ] they like they've got

5243.52 --> 5251.620000000001
more direct concerns Maximus flatius

5247.84 --> 5255.52
yeah the Dutch are unfortunately despite

5251.62 --> 5259.0599999999995
everything very into space a lot of them

5255.52 --> 5261.3
and yeah I mean

5259.06 --> 5264.159000000001
we're a little bit more concerned about

5261.3 --> 5267.34
farming getting banned

5264.159 --> 5269.5599999999995
yeah in one of the biggest food

5267.34 --> 5270.28
producing exporting countries in the

5269.56 --> 5272.219
world

5270.28 --> 5275.739
and about

5272.219 --> 5280.2390000000005
billions being thrown away into this

5275.739 --> 5281.44
insane meat grinder war of Ukraine

5280.239 --> 5283.718999999999
like

5281.44 --> 5288.58
they're spending more money on that than

5283.719 --> 5289.96
they are on NASA okay or on your ASA or

5288.58 --> 5292.62
whatever it's called

5289.96 --> 5292.62

5335.56 --> 5341.1
can't keep the land unless they work it

5338.139 --> 5341.1
no more colored

5341.32 --> 5347.28
now they're losing their land that they

5344.199 --> 5347.28
literally own

5348.94 --> 5353.08
not because they can't keep it because

5351.28 --> 5355.3
they're working it's because they're not

5353.08 --> 5356.92
allowed to work on it they're not

5355.3 --> 5359.7390000000005
allowed to

5356.92 --> 5363.46
use fertilizer

5359.739 --> 5365.86
to to actually grow

5363.46 --> 5369.1
and they're not allowed to have cows

5365.86 --> 5371.799999999999
because they create it and it's all

5369.1 --> 5373.719
[ __ ] insane

5371.8 --> 5375.46
it's just they're just Banning farming

5373.719 --> 5379.06
it's not some trick

5375.46 --> 5381.219
it's not some oh you didn't really read

5379.06 --> 5383.56
the law from 300 years ago no it's

5381.219 --> 5385.179
nothing like that it's just no you're

5383.56 --> 5387.280000000001
just certainly not allowed to have any

5385.179 --> 5389.8
nitrogen

5387.28 --> 5392.08
and

5389.8 --> 5394.12
just for nothing and it's Mega

5392.08 --> 5397.179
hypocritical because

5394.12 --> 5398.98
right across the border they are allowed

5397.179 --> 5401.92
to do that

5398.98 --> 5405.879999999999
so it's literally the Banning of farmers

5401.92 --> 5408.76
of farming for no reason

5405.88 --> 5411.639
it'll be so crazy that literally after

5408.76 --> 5413.8
this like if this goes through and I

5411.639 --> 5416.139
don't think it will because I'll [ __ ]

5413.8 --> 5418.38
kill them before they actually actualize

5416.139 --> 5418.38
it

5419.92 --> 5425.04
no I don't think it's I think that the

5422.02 --> 5425.040000000001
farmers will probably

5426.04 --> 5430.659
do something more

5428.139 --> 5433.0
than just protest

5430.659 --> 5436.239
these guys are kind of organized now

5433.0 --> 5439.179
thank God they are

5436.239 --> 5442.239
and they know how to craft things I mean

5439.179 --> 5444.1
they could literally craft weapons if

5442.239 --> 5447.419999999999
they needed to

5444.1 --> 5447.42
without anybody knowing

5448.42 --> 5453.4800000000005
so I have still have some hopes

5461.62 --> 5465.699
how do they make famous Dutch cheese

5463.9 --> 5469.12
without yeah they want

5465.699 --> 5472.719
they want the entire industry

5469.12 --> 5475.719
the entire Dutch industry that is famous

5472.719 --> 5478.2390000000005
for that it will all be destroyed for

5475.719 --> 5479.679
nothing for absolutely nothing for

5478.239 --> 5482.44
communist

5479.679 --> 5484.3
reasons of just like no we you're just

5482.44 --> 5487.12
not allowed to do it anymore

5484.3 --> 5489.58
this cannot happen this cannot be

5487.12 --> 5493.62
allowed to happen

5489.58 --> 5493.62
people must die for this

5509.739 --> 5514.678999999999
yeah that's right bill and I just they

5511.48 --> 5514.678999999999
that is exactly the reason

5517.84 --> 5522.9400000000005
I think it's time for people to realize

5519.94 --> 5527.5
that [ __ ] comfortably little

5522.94 --> 5528.129999999999
City life is over and it's time to kill

5527.5 --> 5533.05
them

5528.13 --> 5533.05
[Music]

5541.54 --> 5548.62
I think that the rules should be

5545.199 --> 5551.62
social rules should be heavily adapted

5548.62 --> 5554.099999999999
to where if you're gonna be a rioter and

5551.62 --> 5556.54
you just destroy property and vandalize

5554.1 --> 5558.9400000000005
you should be

5556.54 --> 5561.1
it you should be allowed to be legally

5558.94 --> 5562.839999999999
shot

5561.1 --> 5564.58
that's a start

5562.84 --> 5567.9400000000005
just you're doing that

5564.58 --> 5570.82
get ready to get some bullets

5567.94 --> 5574.36
that should be a start

5570.82 --> 5579.12
and then secondary yep

5574.36 --> 5579.12
government should be removed with Force

5580.48 --> 5585.82
yeah that way

5582.28 --> 5588.58
get the [ __ ] writing youth [ __ ]

5585.82 --> 5590.86
under control that they stop doing it so

5588.58 --> 5593.5
that they don't like oh you want to do

5590.86 --> 5595.719
that well guess what you're gonna have a

5593.5 --> 5597.28
gamble whether you live or not

5595.719 --> 5600.52
yeah

5597.28 --> 5602.86
so maybe you want to contain that a

5600.52 --> 5604.96
little and I don't know

5602.86 --> 5607.32
find something more constructive to do

5604.96 --> 5607.32
with that

5607.42 --> 5613.179
or I don't know maybe join the police

5610.02 --> 5616.0
right you want to create a havoc

5613.179 --> 5617.8
there's plenty of Rights gonna happen

5616.0 --> 5619.78
if you're allowed to shoot them I think

5617.8 --> 5622.179
that that would probably get a whole a

5619.78 --> 5626.44
bunch of cops

5622.179 --> 5628.54
a lot more eager to join the force

that's interesting that you live near

the Amish I mean yeah

5782.739 --> 5786.419999999999
you're going to get clean food

5797.32 --> 5799.92
all right

5838.659 --> 5845.4
yeah one more color that's very cute and

5842.02 --> 5845.400000000001
all that but I mean

5845.62 --> 5851.0199999999995
yeah you could just do that

5848.92 --> 5853.4800000000005
but you'll be in the middle of nowhere

5851.02 --> 5856.4800000000005
you will be in the wilderness then

5853.48 --> 5858.339999999999
because country your country is burning

5856.48 --> 5860.98
down

5858.34 --> 5864.219
yeah oh well you can learn to live

5860.98 --> 5870.178999999999
without it yeah but

5864.219 --> 5870.179
or you could just stop it stop them

5871.84 --> 5877.32
you know you could just [ __ ] stop

5875.08 --> 5877.32
them

5878.86 --> 5885.0

I don't know man

5938.08 --> 5946.139
if it's that hard then maybe Canada is

5942.04 --> 5946.139
just Rife for a genocide

5949.54 --> 5955.36
if it's that bad then well maybe the

majority just does need to get burned to

5955.36 --> 5959.139
death then

5956.86 --> 5963.839999999999

nobody that'll actually just stop it

5968.38 --> 5971.58
in the USA okay

5995.98 --> 6001.5199999999995

all die

thank you

6051.659 --> 6057.96
right unless it's it's like archaically

6055.62 --> 6062.219
self-sufficient like the Amish where you

6057.96 --> 6064.38
literally like make your own iron

6062.219 --> 6067.62
yeah where you delve

6064.38 --> 6072.06
and melt your own iron

6067.62 --> 6074.04
where you cost your own nails

6072.06 --> 6077.52
where you cut your where you literally

6074.04 --> 6080.36
do every single aspect of what you're

6077.52 --> 6083.1
doing all of it yourself every step

6080.36 --> 6086.82
every conceivable step and there's a lot

6083.1 --> 6089.52
of steps right unless you do that

6086.82 --> 6092.58
if Society completely breaks down burns

down you're [ __ ]

your durable setup will last a few years

breaking down and then you can't replace

6099.78 --> 6104.34
those things

6101.4 --> 6108.86
and then you die

6104.34 --> 6108.860000000001

6138.96 --> 6146.52
Paul Saul was the first Antichrist

6143.88 --> 6149.52
and it's like the very Foundation of

6146.52 --> 6151.56
every [ __ ] form of Christianity

6149.52 --> 6153.26
except maybe

6151.56 --> 6155.580000000001
like Jefferson

6153.26 --> 6158.400000000001
Jefferson's Bible is like the only

6155.58 --> 6161.46
exception to that I think

6158.4 --> 6164.28
like the only one how [ __ ] crazy is

6161.46 --> 6167.96
that that's the only one

6164.28 --> 6167.96
really mysterious like

in a way too

6173.94 --> 6176.54
right

6176.82 --> 6181.739
so they're all corrupted by the

all Christianity

6183.84 --> 6190.139

Paul

6191.159 --> 6195.839999999999
how Paul changed the system now Paul

6193.98 --> 6197.82
made a church out of it yeah and that's

literally where it corrupted and you all

6197.82 --> 6203.46
buy it every single [ __ ] form of

6233.34 --> 6239.58
very few places very few

6236.76 --> 6241.9800000000005
groups that's in the western world that

6239.58 --> 6244.5
actually does that I mean there's

6241.98 --> 6247.138999999999
other places in the world

6244.5 --> 6250.08
where people do that

6247.139 --> 6253.02
are like barely known about but like

6250.08 --> 6254.699
more places that are kind of cut off of

6253.02 --> 6257.96
the world where they literally from

6254.699 --> 6257.96
scratch just make everything

6259.26 --> 6264.1990000000005
because

6260.4 --> 6264.199
like they can't really

6264.3 --> 6270.06
connect to the outer world and some of

6267.119 --> 6272.339999999999
them don't want to they they seek to

6270.06 --> 6274.76
avoid that at all cost kind of like the

6272.34 --> 6274.76
Amish

6277.08 --> 6281.699
although apparently if they got just

6279.42 --> 6284.6

6311.88 --> 6314.54

living a

6332.46 --> 6338.46
a fulfilling life

6335.76 --> 6340.7390000000005
like whether the ego likes it or not is

6338.46 --> 6342.78
not relevant they do things that are

6340.739 --> 6344.459999999999
fulfilling they live in a way that is

6342.78 --> 6347.3
fulfilling and so they will have less

something

6785.88 --> 6791.1
I never wake up with a headache

I go to bed with a headache but never

wake up with it that's like never

6792.96 --> 6795.32
happened

6796.02 --> 6801.0

dehydrated but that just never really

6801.0 --> 6803.3
happens

6826.739 --> 6829.739
okay

6829.8 --> 6834.139
well then it might be like a metabolic

6831.9 --> 6834.138999999999
thing

6842.159 --> 6844.94
hmm

6845.94 --> 6849.5599999999995
are you getting enough fish oil

[Music]

6871.5 --> 6877.44
you doubt it what do you dove

6875.219 --> 6880.38
do you take fish oil or not because I

6877.44 --> 6884.219
mean if that's like a continual issue

6880.38 --> 6887.36
you you probably should take some

6884.219 --> 6887.36
fish supplements

6888.179 --> 6894.32
did like miracles for me and it if it it

6891.06 --> 6898.639
does it's like a direct

6894.32 --> 6898.639
regeneration support for your brain

6900.84 --> 6906.4400000000005
multivitamins

6903.06 --> 6906.4400000000005
yeah that's not gonna help

6909.36 --> 6914.179
like two now yeah but tuna is not great

6916.8 --> 6920.900000000001
tuna's filled with Mercury and [ __ ]

6921.239 --> 6925.919999999999

salmon is the best

6925.92 --> 6930.42
salmon fish supplements

6928.26 --> 6933.89
look of a good brand not some cheap ass

6930.42 --> 6935.46
brand like that actually helps

6933.89 --> 6938.400000000001
[Music]

6935.46 --> 6942.42
like I used to have like a lot of

6938.4 --> 6945.719
like depression type issues like mood

6942.42 --> 6948.06
it was very pessimistic very lethargic

6945.719 --> 6951.6
I didn't want to do anything fish oil

6948.06 --> 6954.360000000001
totally turned that around

6951.6 --> 6956.820000000001
now even when I'm really demoralized

6954.36 --> 6957.78
about something I still don't feel that

6956.82 --> 6960.84
terrible

6957.78 --> 6963.0599999999995
compared to like in my teens

6960.84 --> 6965.76
when that happened because I take fish

6963.06 --> 6968.219
oil I mean seriously like if I stop

6965.76 --> 6971.119000000001
taking it like I will start to notice

6968.219 --> 6971.119
after like a month

6971.46 --> 6977.1
like like palpable palpably

6974.88 --> 6978.78
probably sooner by the way if I'd stop

6977.1 --> 6981.860000000001
taking it for like two weeks I'd

6978.78 --> 6981.86
probably start noticing

7002.0 --> 7007.239
that is poor yeah well you do something

7004.699 --> 7007.239
about it

7012.8 --> 7017.26
you gotta take better care of yourself

Richard G

7034.94 --> 7041.178999999999
right by the way I found an interesting

7037.34 --> 7045.02
like Diet Doctor

7041.179 --> 7047.96
holistic doctor on YouTube

7045.02 --> 7049.9400000000005
is talking a lot about food and stuff

7047.96 --> 7051.92
he has like really detailed

7049.94 --> 7053.659
presentations

7051.92 --> 7055.9400000000005
that's the thing is

7053.659 --> 7058.159
seeing thus far

7055.94 --> 7059.96
and it's like a it's presented in a way

7058.159 --> 7061.58
that you can really look it up you can

7059.96 --> 7063.38
just flick through his channel and just

7061.58 --> 7065.599
look up specific subject related

7063.38 --> 7067.58
presentations

7065.599 --> 7069.88
uh let me see if we can find him where

7067.58 --> 7069.88
is he

7070.28 --> 7072.82
oh yeah

7073.159 --> 7077.0199999999995
Dr Stan eckerberg

7080.9 --> 7086.179
yeah

7083.179 --> 7087.7390000000005
and he's been at it for a while he has a

7086.179 --> 7089.0
lot of subscribers but I mean I've

7087.739 --> 7091.339999999999
looked through it

7089.0 --> 7094.219
he's good

7091.34 --> 7096.1990000000005
a lot of things that I talk about he

7094.219 --> 7097.88
talks about too which is really cool I

7096.199 --> 7100.58
realize is like

7097.88 --> 7103.34
I mean he has this whole

7100.58 --> 7105.739
video about salt and how we're all

7103.34 --> 7108.32
beings heavily misinformed about salt

7105.739 --> 7110.44
that you actually need it and I mean

7108.32 --> 7113.08
yeah I know

7110.44 --> 7117.08
I mean I effectively

7113.08 --> 7120.5
can eat like a roll a day

7117.08 --> 7123.44
that's a lot of salt and it works great

7120.5 --> 7126.139
don't have hurting kidneys it's all fine

7123.44 --> 7128.598999999999
it can actually yeah just watch some of

7126.139 --> 7130.82
his videos is really interesting

7128.599 --> 7133.6990000000005
I want to know

7130.82 --> 7136.239
food details and all that It's really

7133.699 --> 7136.239
informative

7141.139 --> 7146.84
a lot of people are so deficient yes

7143.0 --> 7149.119
because you need salt for your

7146.84 --> 7151.84
for your cellular yeah for your fluid

7149.119 --> 7151.839999999999
regulation

7152.78 --> 7161.42
if you don't have enough salts then

7157.119 --> 7164.739
it's gonna yeah it's gonna weaken

7161.42 --> 7164.7390000000005
it's gonna weaken your system

7169.06 --> 7173.780000000001
bioelectrics indeed so yeah you had this

7171.739 --> 7175.04
whole video about it very interesting I

7173.78 --> 7177.94
was actually watching that yesterday

7175.04 --> 7177.94
about salt

7180.56 --> 7183.88
let's see if I can find it

7190.699 --> 7198.82
okay this guy is so many videos it is

7195.139 --> 7198.82
and they're all pretty interesting

7204.85 --> 7208.169000000001
[Music]

7208.52 --> 7214.46
is awesome he's also like all he's he's

7211.4 --> 7216.739
basically like yeah saturated fat is

7214.46 --> 7219.32
actually really good I mean

7216.739 --> 7221.54
he gets it right thus far he's got it he

7219.32 --> 7222.98
gets it right and he's even like yeah

7221.54 --> 7225.86
you need

7222.98 --> 7227.48
he's like Pro meat eating and very

7225.86 --> 7230.719
specific about it

7227.48 --> 7233.299999999999
I mean it's a full spectrum

7230.719 --> 7235.4
information that you get here and it's

7233.3 --> 7237.9800000000005
all good I mean all these things that

7235.4 --> 7239.54
every video I watched and I've watched

7237.98 --> 7242.54
like three or four

7239.54 --> 7245.3
every single tip he gave all resonated

7242.54 --> 7247.699
when it's all like oh yeah that's what I

7245.3 --> 7249.02
heard indeed so he seems to just get it

7247.699 --> 7250.879999999999
all right

7249.02 --> 7254.8
it's really interesting

7250.88 --> 7254.8
I can't find the sword video though

7255.38 --> 7263.42
he has just tons and tons of tips

7259.34 --> 7267.1990000000005
or different health conditions and like

7263.42 --> 7269.119
what should you do what shouldn't you do

7267.199 --> 7272.0
very Broad

7269.119 --> 7274.46
very diet oriented everything is all

7272.0 --> 7276.699
about food on this channel great good

7274.46 --> 7276.699
stuff

7277.28 --> 7280.759999999999
it's pretty cool share a link I already

7279.44 --> 7283.96
did that

7280.76 --> 7283.96
but I'll do it again

7286.77 --> 7290.919000000001
[Music]

7295.639 --> 7299.96
yeah it is a popular Channel by the way

7297.92 --> 7302.96
so expect it if you're gonna watch a

7299.96 --> 7304.82
video you're probably immediately gonna

7302.96 --> 7307.4
have all your recommended YouTube

7304.82 --> 7310.34
recommendation be his videos which is

7307.4 --> 7312.92
literally the case right now it's like

7310.34 --> 7314.900000000001
once you get a popular Channel you start

7312.92 --> 7316.099
watching it then all your recommended

7314.9 --> 7319.879999999999
are gonna be that

7316.099 --> 7322.04
does it happen I find it quite agitating

7319.88 --> 7324.08
that YouTube does that

7322.04 --> 7326.599
it's like every time you get into

7324.08 --> 7328.94
anything it just shoves it into your

7326.599 --> 7331.82
face until it's like too much it just

7328.94 --> 7334.879999999999
keeps doing that it's like no I watched

7331.82 --> 7337.699
a video thought it was cool subscribe to

7334.88 --> 7340.82
the channel I don't now want to see the

7337.699 --> 7342.32
10 000 hours of only those videos why

7340.82 --> 7345.92
would you do that

7342.32 --> 7348.259999999999
right it's stupid it's ineffective

7345.92 --> 7349.76
I don't want to obsess over anything I

7348.26 --> 7353.4800000000005
subscribe to

7349.76 --> 7357.219
it's a foolish way of managing

7353.48 --> 7357.218999999999
the algorithm in my opinion

7357.56 --> 7364.119000000001
sorry for the atrocious typing skills uh

7360.26 --> 7364.119000000001
I wasn't really seeing that

7376.219 --> 7381.32
yeah yeah more called indeed

7379.46 --> 7384.32
of course it's better better to get it

7381.32 --> 7386.42
out of the food directly the rawer the

7384.32 --> 7388.5199999999995
better

7386.42 --> 7390.9800000000005
more raw the better anyway I'm gonna

7388.52 --> 7393.9400000000005
take a two-minute break

7390.98 --> 7393.94
we'll be right back

7437.05 --> 7440.43
[Music]

7441.38 --> 7444.38
foreign

7470.119 --> 7472.299999999999
thank you

7496.04 --> 7499.239
and back

7513.199 --> 7518.119
yeah I know slow-mo moon buggy yeah you

7515.54 --> 7521.48
can indeed tell them to not

7518.119 --> 7525.0199999999995
recommend it but I mean

7521.48 --> 7526.82
why do it why just

7525.02 --> 7529.280000000001
I mean I'm kind of it's kind of annoying

7526.82 --> 7531.58
to be having to do that every single

7529.28 --> 7531.58
time

7536.599 --> 7542.119000000001
wouldn't it be better to actually just

7539.0 --> 7544.52
like have an option

7542.119 --> 7547.159
like an extra button or something where

7544.52 --> 7550.099
you can say like have recommendations

7547.159 --> 7551.96
from this Channel or something

7550.099 --> 7553.6990000000005
that you can choose what you're gonna

7551.96 --> 7557.2390000000005
get recommended

7553.699 --> 7561.379999999999
instead of having to unchoose it

7557.239 --> 7564.098999999999
right I mean like what if you want to

7561.38 --> 7566.3
choose it again after having

7564.099 --> 7569.2390000000005
unchosen it

7566.3 --> 7571.219
how do you do that then it's kind of

7569.239 --> 7574.879999999999
pointless

7571.219 --> 7577.88
why don't you just have a mark box

7574.88 --> 7581.8
you just turn recommendations for that

7577.88 --> 7581.8
channel off or on done

7643.04 --> 7649.659
you're gonna go for the the cod oil

7645.8 --> 7649.659000000001
Richard G yeah give it a try

7652.639 --> 7659.8
Blaze TV had whites on oh all right

7657.26 --> 7659.8
huh

7665.9 --> 7669.159
did he do any good

7669.56 --> 7677.1990000000005
or was it just the

7673.46 --> 7677.199
I probably did fine

7698.119 --> 7700.78
hmm

7702.38 --> 7707.42
okay Anthony that's weird

7705.739 --> 7709.94
I haven't heard of

7707.42 --> 7713.1990000000005
sodium fluoride doing that and mostly

7709.94 --> 7713.199
just kills things

7714.5 --> 7720.98
but it's

7716.659 --> 7724.46
yeah atrazine that does that that's the

7720.98 --> 7727.239
thing that turns to frogs yay

7724.46 --> 7727.2390000000005
and all that

7733.88 --> 7739.179
Blaze TV was very anti-flatter three

7736.52 --> 7739.179
years yeah

7743.599 --> 7746.92
BPA yeah

7751.76 --> 7756.9400000000005
yeah BPA that's in plastic and printer

7754.58 --> 7756.94
ink

7757.4 --> 7761.48
but I mean

7759.219 --> 7764.2390000000005
BPA does that

7761.48 --> 7766.58
to a degree atrazine does it really

7764.239 --> 7769.04
strongly

7766.58 --> 7771.32
like BPA is just something that kind of

7769.04 --> 7774.92
leeches from plastic but it's not like

7771.32 --> 7777.32
you keep a frog in a plastic bottle and

7774.92 --> 7780.88
then it's automatically gonna become gay

7777.32 --> 7780.88
that doesn't necessarily happen

7781.94 --> 7788.199
over time it will happen but atrazine is

7784.699 --> 7788.199
like much more aggressive

7790.099 --> 7793.58
because it's pesticide

7791.94 --> 7796.098999999999
[Music]

7793.58 --> 7799.159
it's like supposed to do that it's the

7796.099 --> 7801.46
function of atrazine to do that as a

7799.159 --> 7801.46
weapon

7818.14 --> 7822.06
[Music]

7831.5 --> 7834.159
foreign

7834.33 --> 7837.47
[Music]

7840.219 --> 7844.94
like all this new type of food it's all

7843.5 --> 7847.52
garbage

7844.94 --> 7850.879999999999
like bugs are not gonna make food good

7847.52 --> 7853.52
food like artificial meat

7850.88 --> 7856.400000000001
absolutely atrocious all of these things

7853.52 --> 7859.84
are like not

7856.4 --> 7859.839999999999
not good for food

7860.9 --> 7866.48
but I mean all these new food things are

7864.26 --> 7868.58
all being created specifically to

7866.48 --> 7869.78
exterminate us that's what they're there

7868.58 --> 7872.96
for

7869.78 --> 7876.199
they're like the last food

7872.96 --> 7878.06
they're the the food that's there in the

7876.199 --> 7881.739
face where we get exterminated that's

7878.06 --> 7881.7390000000005
where why they've been concocted

7883.34 --> 7887.0
they want to put us specifically on that

7885.8 --> 7891.88
to

7887.0 --> 7891.88
just make population collapse

7897.22 --> 7900.569
[Music]

7905.42 --> 7911.139
yeah more color yeah cannabis seeds are

7908.3 --> 7911.139
pretty decent

7911.48 --> 7917.138999999999
it's a good supplement to take like

7913.88 --> 7917.139
alongside other food

7921.199 --> 7927.638999999999
I'd still take fish oil over that

7924.92 --> 7927.639
personally

7928.52 --> 7932.659000000001
tastes good as well maybe

7935.75 --> 7939.01
[Music]

7948.76 --> 7955.52
oh wow okay Richie that's dramatic but

7952.76 --> 7957.320000000001
if that's in the family and she ate all

7955.52 --> 7958.88
those nuts and then well then you

7957.32 --> 7961.34
probably

7958.88 --> 7963.639
that you probably really will need fish

7961.34 --> 7963.639
oil

7964.46 --> 7969.079
because if she's like eating nuts like

7966.679 --> 7971.36
that well it's kind of the same Source

7969.079 --> 7974.799999999999
except well

7971.36 --> 7978.5599999999995
it's much harder to actually transform

7974.8 --> 7979.820000000001
nuts into the proper substances that you

7978.56 --> 7983.0
you need

7979.82 --> 7985.88
while with fish oil you it just has them

7983.0 --> 7987.199
readily for absorption that's the big

7985.88 --> 7990.32
difference

7987.199 --> 7993.138999999999
so you'll have to take less fish oil

7990.32 --> 7996.139
compared to like your mother eating like

7993.139 --> 7998.84
a bowl of nuts every day

7996.139 --> 8001.900000000001
because you need more of it to actually

7998.84 --> 8004.3
get the right things out of it

8001.9 --> 8007.199
that's why I definitely prefer fish oil

8004.3 --> 8007.1990000000005
over nuts

8008.8 --> 8011.8
overseeds

8023.04 --> 8029.4
eating cannabis raw yeah surely it is

8026.44 --> 8029.4
although

8030.04 --> 8036.219
I'd prefer oil

8032.32 --> 8036.219
cannabis oil then

8037.54 --> 8043.679
that's like that's the good stuff that's

8040.36 --> 8043.679
that extra special

8044.8 --> 8050.320000000001
I've considered like I don't know if it

8047.44 --> 8051.759999999999
will work right but I mean could you

8050.32 --> 8054.82
like have

8051.76 --> 8057.360000000001
fish oil that's been saturated with

8054.82 --> 8057.36
cannabis

8057.82 --> 8063.219
right

8060.34 --> 8068.639
and then add maybe a little curcuma

8063.219 --> 8068.639
extract and you'd have like a magic Trio

8071.619 --> 8075.699
I actually thought of like that years

8073.719 --> 8078.219
ago and like wanted to have like a

8075.699 --> 8080.199
supplement like that where you have like

8078.219 --> 8086.219
CBD oil

8080.199 --> 8089.4
or cannabis extract in fish oil with

8086.219 --> 8089.4
like the

8089.46 --> 8097.26
cannabinoids now wait uh the yeah

8093.219 --> 8097.26
to turmeric extract

8097.9 --> 8103.299999999999
combined I mean it would even like be

8101.139 --> 8106.3
tasty like it would even like be

8103.3 --> 8108.820000000001
properly tasty together but to put that

8106.3 --> 8111.579000000001
in One supplement concentrated would be

8108.82 --> 8114.299999999999
like like a magic golden pill

8111.579 --> 8114.299999999999
like that

8135.49 --> 8140.619
[Music]

8137.139 --> 8142.3
right it yeah it would be cool if one

8140.619 --> 8143.259999999999
day I could have make that as a

8142.3 --> 8145.78
supplement

8143.26 --> 8147.280000000001
it's like the golden pill like a pretty

8145.78 --> 8149.34
big pill

8147.28 --> 8152.92
with fish oil

8149.34 --> 8154.42
cannabis extract and turmeric extract

8152.92 --> 8157.659
all in one

8154.42 --> 8160.9800000000005
just one golden pill

8157.659 --> 8160.98
I mean that would be awesome

8166.48 --> 8171.459999999999
our terpenes would give slaver yes

8171.579 --> 8176.219
their terpenes are like in the resin

8185.32 --> 8187.92
thank you

8198.76 --> 8203.460000000001
what what are you talking about getting

8200.92 --> 8203.460000000001
wisdom

8229.66 --> 8235.0
you don't see us and why not until

8232.0 --> 8236.2
leaving qatarsis

8235.0 --> 8238.899
why not

8236.2 --> 8242.219000000001
I mean they are fat soluble

8238.899 --> 8242.219
you can combine them

8253.139 --> 8258.219
jeez my computer keeps on blowing and

8256.059 --> 8261.899
blowing

8258.219 --> 8261.899
take it easy man

8268.139 --> 8271.499
[Music]

8292.179 --> 8296.679
what form can you get cannabinoids like

8295.3 --> 8299.38
that

8296.679 --> 8302.76
is it just oil yeah

8299.38 --> 8302.759999999998
it's dissolved in oil

8305.2 --> 8311.019
because the pure connect cannabis stuff

8308.32 --> 8313.119999999999
is like resin so it's

8311.019 --> 8314.439
tough

8313.12 --> 8316.0
it's like a

8314.439 --> 8319.359
custard

8316.0 --> 8322.12
oily but sticky

8319.359 --> 8326.639000000001
and that dissolves in oil so they just

8322.12 --> 8326.639000000001
add a little oil some kind

8327.099 --> 8332.139000000001
don't know which oil they use

8329.32 --> 8333.039999999999
probably seed oil or olive oil or

8332.139 --> 8337.139
something

8333.04 --> 8337.139000000001
and that's how they have cannabis oil

8356.04 --> 8361.059000000001
not a fan of plant I don't know why

8358.84 --> 8363.399
until Lutheran cathars I don't know why

8361.059 --> 8364.599
you have a problem with plant oils like

8363.399 --> 8366.639
that

8364.599 --> 8370.059
I mean it all depends on what you're

8366.639 --> 8372.399
going to do with those plant oils

8370.059 --> 8374.139
yeah if you're gonna heat them

8372.399 --> 8377.559
like a lot

8374.139 --> 8379.779999999999
that's bad but just plant oils are not

8377.559 --> 8382.599
bad

8379.78 --> 8386.439
they're not

8382.599 --> 8388.42
at least most of them or well yeah I

8386.439 --> 8390.1
usually just stick to olive oil because

8388.42 --> 8393.04
I know that works the best

8390.1 --> 8394.24
lime seed oil also really works and then

8393.04 --> 8396.880000000001
there's like

8394.24 --> 8399.18
other things like canola oil that's not

8396.88 --> 8399.179999999998
good

8399.76 --> 8405.76
so yeah some vegetable based oils are

8403.18 --> 8408.1
not good and others are

8405.76 --> 8410.26
if you go to the organic stores you

8408.1 --> 8413.220000000001
pretty much get all different kinds of

8410.26 --> 8416.880000000001
oil of the ones that aren't damaging

8413.22 --> 8416.88
it's really that simple

8417.0 --> 8422.14
yeah canola I've heard about but I've

8420.28 --> 8424.479000000001
never actually tried it but it was this

8422.14 --> 8427.24
whole item about it like in

8424.479 --> 8429.399
2010

8427.24 --> 8433.74
so I happen to know that from about

8429.399 --> 8433.74
canola oil that it is really unhealthy

8434.399 --> 8438.72
and apparently disgusting too

8439.24 --> 8444.1
yeah you do want cold pressed oils

8441.34 --> 8446.2
that's right but things like virgin oils

8444.1 --> 8448.68
like virgin olive oil they are cold

8446.2 --> 8448.68
pressed

8455.62 --> 8464.2
right but I mean I use

8460.359 --> 8467.319
olive oil for my French fries

8464.2 --> 8470.140000000001
that works it it really works fine guys

8467.319 --> 8472.66
it's no problem

8470.14 --> 8475.358999999999
it might become problematic if I

8472.66 --> 8478.66
accidentally overheat the fries

8475.359 --> 8482.380000000001
all right overheat the oil let it like

8478.66 --> 8484.42
it gets like it starts to actually cook

8482.38 --> 8486.64
where you can start to see the smoke

8484.42 --> 8490.12
coming up that's like too hot then the

8486.64 --> 8492.34
oil gets damaged or if I leave just too

8490.12 --> 8494.380000000001
much fry

8492.34 --> 8497.5
powder and

8494.38 --> 8500.14
bits in the aura because that does even

8497.5 --> 8502.359
you have to sift it out but

8500.14 --> 8505.479
some of it is so small you can't sift it

8502.359 --> 8508.42
out it's like ashes in the oil of potato

8505.479 --> 8512.199999999999
ashes it's almost like that but if that

8508.42 --> 8515.56
stuff gets heated reheated too much too

8512.2 --> 8518.560000000001
many times that it also swells the oil

8515.56 --> 8522.34
but you can get like a lot of French

8518.56 --> 8525.519999999999
file fries out of one batch of oil

8522.34 --> 8529.18
and it's absolutely no problem no issues

8525.52 --> 8532.479000000001
with my stomach with my brain it's not a

8529.18 --> 8534.220000000001
ballast it feels good

8532.479 --> 8536.26
it's great

8534.22 --> 8539.14
I that's why I've been eating french

8536.26 --> 8541.54
fries like that for years now it's

8539.14 --> 8542.5
worked out great and I'm talking about

8541.54 --> 8545.68
like

8542.5 --> 8548.38
pretty much every every two days

8545.68 --> 8550.74
I eat french fries some days I eat it

8548.38 --> 8550.74
every day

8550.899 --> 8555.899
it's great it really works just fine

8557.68 --> 8563.52
don't get any negative side effects I

8560.08 --> 8567.539999999999
don't feel any weaker or anything

8563.52 --> 8567.54
I've been doing it for years

8567.64 --> 8572.56
by the way that's also how my parents

8570.16 --> 8574.3
taught me that's how we had french fries

8572.56 --> 8576.16
back in the day

8574.3 --> 8576.96
right my parents weren't like oh you

8576.16 --> 8580.06
just

8576.96 --> 8583.3
buys standard fryer and this and that no

8580.06 --> 8588.519999999999
no they would do it like me like

8583.3 --> 8590.92
in a big pen on a fire not some electric

8588.52 --> 8593.92
stupid thing with it with like the

8590.92 --> 8596.68
little basket and all that crap but just

8593.92 --> 8598.6
really old-fashioned and I do it like

8596.68 --> 8600.1
that I just have this big

8598.6 --> 8603.16
walk

8600.1 --> 8605.74
like this half a bowl this Dome half a

8603.16 --> 8606.939
dome upside down dump like half filled

8605.74 --> 8610.08
with oil

8606.939 --> 8610.08
and it works great

8610.18 --> 8613.62
gets a bit dirty

8614.68 --> 8618.460000000001
sometimes

8616.24 --> 8621.64
but I'm like really good at it don't

8618.46 --> 8624.039999999999
yeah so I mean I'm not having health

8621.64 --> 8626.38
issues from this at all and sometimes

8624.04 --> 8629.140000000001
french fries is like the only thing I

8626.38 --> 8632.259999999998
eat in the day okay

8629.14 --> 8635.76
so I would notice

8632.26 --> 8635.76
it's not damaging

8637.78 --> 8643.0
just don't overheat it don't

8640.6 --> 8645.819
eat it so much that you'll see the smoke

8643.0 --> 8648.1
coming off it that's bad now the oil is

8645.819 --> 8649.96
ruined now it becomes toxic and you can

8648.1 --> 8652.359
actually feel it

8649.96 --> 8653.858999999999
like I've had that happen

8652.359 --> 8655.479000000001
and then I would still eat the french

8653.859 --> 8658.42
fries

8655.479 --> 8661.3
and then I'd start to feel it it's like

8658.42 --> 8663.16
like

8661.3 --> 8665.259999999998
mmm this is not good like there's

8663.16 --> 8667.06
something wrong with the oil like in the

8665.26 --> 8668.979
fries you could just feel like this is

8667.06 --> 8671.74
not feeling good

8668.979 --> 8675.099999999999
right but that only really happens when

8671.74 --> 8678.22
I just overheat the oil by accident once

8675.1 --> 8680.380000000001
and after you overheated it once

8678.22 --> 8682.42
it's ruined after that so if you keep

8680.38 --> 8683.319
reusing it you'll keep having that

8682.42 --> 8687.24
feeling

8683.319 --> 8687.24
because the oil is damaged

8693.939 --> 8698.800000000001
extract any canopy strike if I get fish

8696.939 --> 8701.319
oil I can make the field that would be

8698.8 --> 8704.619999999999
interesting flatter Sage

8701.319 --> 8707.439
that would be really interesting

8704.62 --> 8709.479000000001
I'm yeah I'm almost jealous because

8707.439 --> 8712.6
that's that's something I really had

8709.479 --> 8715.8
planned to do I really wanted to do that

8712.6 --> 8715.800000000001
like years ago

8717.7 --> 8723.359
but if you could try it out

8719.859 --> 8723.359
and if it works great

8723.64 --> 8729.46
maybe yeah maybe

8726.22 --> 8733.679999999998
maybe send me a batch

8729.46 --> 8733.679999999998
I want some of that I want to try it out

8738.01 --> 8741.12
[Music]

8745.6 --> 8750.6
fat is not the culprit of heart disease

8748.0 --> 8750.6
yeah I agree

8754.319 --> 8760.72
yeah fat doesn't actually make you fat

8757.479 --> 8763.599999999999
fat keeps you Slim now if you eat bad

8760.72 --> 8767.56
fat or fat Replacements or sugar

8763.6 --> 8770.2
Replacements that makes you fat

8767.56 --> 8772.18
fat doesn't make you fat fat makes you

8770.2 --> 8774.220000000001
Slim

8772.18 --> 8776.319
unless it's going to be fat that's

8774.22 --> 8779.679999999998
really incredibly disgusting because

8776.319 --> 8781.6
it's filled with sugar and taste stuff

8779.68 --> 8786.66
and it's been processed over and over

8781.6 --> 8786.66
again like those disgusting ice creams

8786.76 --> 8790.54
that the mainstream ice cream that they

8788.92 --> 8793.42
get shoved in your face all the time

8790.54 --> 8795.28
like that fat is [ __ ] lethal like

8793.42 --> 8797.5
that fat is the worst form you can

8795.28 --> 8802.24
imagine

8797.5 --> 8806.26
but if it's just fat like olive oil

8802.24 --> 8809.399
white or butter good organic butter yeah

8806.26 --> 8813.7
and guess what that doesn't make you fat

8809.399 --> 8815.74
that actually makes you Slim

8813.7 --> 8817.84
yeah because if you eat too much of it

8815.74 --> 8819.22
well you're gonna just like it's just

8817.84 --> 8820.479
gonna go straight through it says you

8819.22 --> 8822.22
gotta slide through you're probably

8820.479 --> 8824.56
gonna [ __ ] most of it out again it's

8822.22 --> 8825.819
gonna be a fatty diarrhea it's gross

8824.56 --> 8827.619999999999
yeah

8825.819 --> 8829.899
it's not gonna make you fat though

8827.62 --> 8832.42
that's the thing that's the funny funny

8829.899 --> 8833.979
thing about fat is that fat makes you

8832.42 --> 8839.319
not fat

8833.979 --> 8841.72
yeah I eat a lot of fat I am not fat I'm

8839.319 --> 8844.18
absolutely not fat

8841.72 --> 8846.399
right you want to get fat eat bread eat

8844.18 --> 8848.439
a lot of bread own Benjamin knows all

8846.399 --> 8851.08
about that he's like cursed with having

8848.439 --> 8852.399
his wife make like the best sourdough

8851.08 --> 8854.92
bread in the world or something

8852.399 --> 8856.74
apparently it's really tasty yeah that's

8854.92 --> 8860.5
gonna make you fat

8856.74 --> 8863.08
actual fat does not make you fat

8860.5 --> 8866.319
how funny is that

8863.08 --> 8868.6
right unless it's really polluted fat

8866.319 --> 8871.3
and and treat it and just

8868.6 --> 8873.76
damaged if it's damaged fat yeah that's

8871.3 --> 8877.119999999999
gonna make you fat because why

8873.76 --> 8881.56
because your body can't actually use

8877.12 --> 8884.5
that fat and so it's gonna store it in

8881.56 --> 8889.18
fat layers because it's damaged it's

8884.5 --> 8891.939
gonna look for proper undamaged fat to

8889.18 --> 8895.06
be able to process it and get rid of it

8891.939 --> 8897.880000000001
again yeah so yeah you eat bad fat that

8895.06 --> 8901.6
bad Fat's gonna store like a junkyard

8897.88 --> 8904.0
it's gonna store junk in your fat layers

8901.6 --> 8906.460000000001
that's the fat that's gonna build up and

8904.0 --> 8907.6
then it's like can we please have the

8906.46 --> 8910.66
good fat

8907.6 --> 8913.0
so we can get rid of the bad side

8910.66 --> 8916.0
and that you eat good fats

8913.0 --> 8918.7
and guess what you're gonna grow Slimmer

8916.0 --> 8921.6
it's gonna go away because fat doesn't

8918.7 --> 8921.6
make you fat

8924.12 --> 8928.960000000001
it's something I learned

8926.8 --> 8932.22
decades ago

8928.96 --> 8932.22
and I'm loving it

8934.72 --> 8938.56
yeah sugar will make you fat

8937.06 --> 8942.46
that's right

8938.56 --> 8945.22
because sugar is like excessively toxic

8942.46 --> 8947.08
and when you have too much sugar then

8945.22 --> 8948.58
your body might like in a desperate

8947.08 --> 8952.12
attempt

8948.58 --> 8955.539999999999
quickly transform it into fats

8952.12 --> 8958.12
to store but guess what those fats kind

8955.54 --> 8961.240000000002
of toxic yep your body actually starts

8958.12 --> 8964.12
making fats out of excessive sugar that

8961.24 --> 8966.64
Fat's gonna be very toxic and thus it's

8964.12 --> 8969.28
going to sit there desperately waiting

8966.64 --> 8971.68
for you to get healthy fats so you can

8969.28 --> 8973.6
get rid of those bad fats

8971.68 --> 8976.06
that come from sugar

8973.6 --> 8978.28
or damaged fat consumption

8976.06 --> 8981.16
see how this works

8978.28 --> 8984.0
fat helps you get rid of fat

8981.16 --> 8984.0
the bad fat

8986.319 --> 8993.039999999999
yeah and sugar feeds Cancer all of that

8988.54 --> 8996.460000000001
like all talks storing toxic [ __ ] in in

8993.04 --> 8997.78
your body like a toxic dump that creates

8996.46 --> 9000.679999999998
cancer

8997.78 --> 9000.68
that's right

9013.92 --> 9019.08
body makes fat

9016.56 --> 9021.779999999999
from sugar and starches

9019.08 --> 9024.72
yeah because it's too much it's too much

9021.78 --> 9027.24
in your body we ate way too much glucose

9024.72 --> 9028.38
and sugar and all that and it gets

9027.24 --> 9030.42
transformed

9028.38 --> 9033.479
into fat

9030.42 --> 9036.72
a bad type of fat

9033.479 --> 9038.34
what you can still like still then if

9036.72 --> 9040.438999999998
you just stop eating sugar then

9038.34 --> 9042.6
eventually it'll be like hey you got all

9040.439 --> 9044.399
these fats yeah well let's transform it

9042.6 --> 9047.28
back into sugar

9044.399 --> 9049.8
I mean that does happen but it's

9047.28 --> 9054.300000000001
uncomfortable though

9049.8 --> 9056.88
but if you get good fats then your body

9054.3 --> 9058.92
can use those good fats to like do a

9056.88 --> 9061.14
little switch your root trick

9058.92 --> 9063.66
with the fats that are bad

9061.14 --> 9065.819
it like that's why the good fats

9063.66 --> 9068.76
literally help you get rid of the bad

9065.819 --> 9072.479
fat that's my experience

9068.76 --> 9075.24
like the fat in my body is freaking good

9072.479 --> 9079.199999999999
I got good fat I mean I got a little

9075.24 --> 9081.899
but I know I can feel that that fat is

9079.2 --> 9085.26
good I can feel that this fat is good

9081.899 --> 9087.66
it's not bogging me down it's healthy is

9085.26 --> 9090.42
keeping me young yeah having the right

9087.66 --> 9095.24
fats in your body healthy fats keeps you

9090.42 --> 9095.24
young it's good critical for your skin

9096.899 --> 9103.199999999999
if you have bad fats in your system you

9099.359 --> 9105.06
store it your Skin's gonna start to look

9103.2 --> 9107.880000000001
you know what that looks like I mean

9105.06 --> 9109.56
those really bloaty people do they ever

9107.88 --> 9112.979
have great skin

9109.56 --> 9115.859
no they never have great skin why

9112.979 --> 9119.66
because they're filled with toxic fats

9115.859 --> 9119.66
that are a burden on the skin

9130.04 --> 9137.460000000001
yeah animal fat is great too because it

9134.1 --> 9140.399000000001
contains a lot of the things that you

9137.46 --> 9144.3
need in the fats

9140.399 --> 9147.0
if those animals were basically they had

9144.3 --> 9149.099999999999
a healthy diet that is

9147.0 --> 9151.76
they were just trashy there's that Fat's

9149.1 --> 9151.76
not going to be good

9154.38 --> 9160.8
but yeah

9155.899 --> 9163.8
organic farm-raised animal fat or fat

9160.8 --> 9167.58
from uh from Wild

9163.8 --> 9171.179999999998
yeah can be great it's very rich fat is

9167.58 --> 9174.42
like a critical substance that store

9171.18 --> 9176.399
that your body actively uses not just it

9174.42 --> 9180.42
happens to be like that but it actively

9176.399 --> 9183.96
uses to store vitamins

9180.42 --> 9186.899
yeah your body uses that fat like a

9183.96 --> 9189.179999999998
treasure chest to store all these

9186.899 --> 9193.019999999999
specific things that are fat soluble in

9189.18 --> 9195.0
it uses good fat specifically as like

9193.02 --> 9197.76
treasure chests in your body that's what

9195.0 --> 9199.8
your body does that's why animals that

9197.76 --> 9202.74
have fat on them

9199.8 --> 9204.899
well they're basically filled with

9202.74 --> 9207.24
the good fat that's gonna have a lot of

9204.899 --> 9209.779999999999
good vitamin and all these extra things

9207.24 --> 9209.78
in it

9210.06 --> 9217.1
that's what makes animal fat so great

9212.76 --> 9217.1
if it's been properly grazed and fed

9223.979 --> 9228.358999999999
lots of dairy yeah but Dairy is

9226.38 --> 9230.938999999998
different though

9228.359 --> 9233.819
right milk

9230.939 --> 9236.64
if you eat anything that's not raw milk

9233.819 --> 9238.199999999999
any milk that's not raw is not super

9236.64 --> 9240.3
good for you

9238.2 --> 9242.28
there's a lot of steps because the

9240.3 --> 9244.319
proteins are broken your body is

9242.28 --> 9246.960000000001
actually going to make effort to turn it

9244.319 --> 9250.14
into something useful again it's not

9246.96 --> 9252.179999999998
healthy really to drink pasteurized milk

9250.14 --> 9255.0
and all that it's really better to just

9252.18 --> 9256.439
drink it raw but butter has no you do

9255.0 --> 9260.16
you won't have that issue with butter

9256.439 --> 9264.08
good organic butter

9260.16 --> 9264.08
you don't get a bigger bottom from that

9267.72 --> 9271.22
it's just really good

9282.74 --> 9295.349
yeah more colored indeed

9285.24 --> 9295.349
[Music]

9299.4 --> 9304.859
[Music]

9301.38 --> 9307.679999999998
no high cholesterol yeah but that's good

9304.859 --> 9309.12
flatter Sage cholesterol is actually

9307.68 --> 9311.399
good

9309.12 --> 9312.6
you need it's like watch that doctor

9311.399 --> 9315.18
again

9312.6 --> 9318.300000000001
he has a whole video about it how fats

9315.18 --> 9321.899
are exactly necessary it's just what I

9318.3 --> 9324.3
said by the way I didn't watch a video

9321.899 --> 9326.76
like that I just know he has them

9324.3 --> 9328.92
because this is my information I didn't

9326.76 --> 9331.74
just copy all this from the doctor now

9328.92 --> 9333.66
this is my information I've had this

9331.74 --> 9336.96
information I've rolled out this

9333.66 --> 9338.7
information on my show for years

9336.96 --> 9340.858999999999
it's not because I just watched the

9338.7 --> 9342.66
doctor I just know that about fats it's

9340.859 --> 9346.16
one of the things that I really learned

9342.66 --> 9346.16
in the last decade

9349.26 --> 9354.24
having cholesterol in your blood is good

9351.72 --> 9357.3
you need it it's critical

9354.24 --> 9361.34
without cholesterol you have higher

9357.3 --> 9361.34
risks of aneurysms and all that

9361.74 --> 9368.28
really you need it you desperately need

9365.58 --> 9369.6
it cholesterol is a critical

9368.28 --> 9372.54
in

9369.6 --> 9375.24
majority of your brain is made out of

9372.54 --> 9378.18
cholesterol

9375.24 --> 9381.26
like all these functions all these

9378.18 --> 9383.899
organs your liver they all need it

9381.26 --> 9387.54
really badly

9383.899 --> 9389.699999999999
you need fat you need it a lot this

9387.54 --> 9392.399000000001
stupid group oh you can't have too much

9389.7 --> 9393.720000000001
fat your arteries will slip it's pure

9392.399 --> 9396.539999999999
[ __ ]

9393.72 --> 9400.5
it's just a lie

9396.54 --> 9403.5
it only happens from toxic fat

9400.5 --> 9406.2
then the cholesterol can be

9403.5 --> 9408.0
transformed it can be assimilated and

9406.2 --> 9409.740000000002
then it just starts floating around and

9408.0 --> 9413.46
then it might clog up yeah if you eat

9409.74 --> 9417.479
like a lot of really bad fatty ice cream

9413.46 --> 9419.099999999999
all the time and cheap ass chips if you

9417.479 --> 9421.5
eat that and then you fill up with

9419.1 --> 9423.18
really bad cholesterol really bad fats

9421.5 --> 9425.22
yeah then you're gonna get heart

9423.18 --> 9428.04
problems then you're gonna get slip

9425.22 --> 9430.38
arteries all that [ __ ] it doesn't happen

9428.04 --> 9433.800000000001
if you healthy fats

9430.38 --> 9437.779999999999
because you need those you need them a

9433.8 --> 9437.779999999999
lot you really need them badly

9447.26 --> 9455.7
don't avoid fat avoid junk food

9452.64 --> 9459.359999999999
that's it that's the formula

9455.7 --> 9468.300000000001
don't avoid fat avoid junk food

9459.36 --> 9470.34
[Music]

9468.3 --> 9473.96
that's right

9470.34 --> 9473.960000000001
yeah Sugar Ruins fat

9483.12 --> 9488.640000000001
too much calcium reaches iron from oh I

9486.78 --> 9489.720000000001
didn't know my color could be I don't

9488.64 --> 9492.68
know

9489.72 --> 9492.679999999998
never heard of that

9492.71 --> 9496.699999999999
[Music]

9505.08 --> 9509.72
yeah indeed and to move in catharsis

9510.3 --> 9514.979
yeah animals that eat meat they prefer

9512.819 --> 9517.68
organs because the organs are all filled

9514.979 --> 9519.72
with like key components it's like a key

9517.68 --> 9520.92
storage

9519.72 --> 9523.5
for

9520.92 --> 9525.78
certain substances that well when they

9523.5 --> 9528.359
eat it it just directly assimilates it

9525.78 --> 9531.66
just directly feels that you eat an

9528.359 --> 9534.42
organ you basically feel that organ that

9531.66 --> 9536.64
you have in your body to up

9534.42 --> 9538.92
with what you got out of it it's like it

9536.64 --> 9541.319
literally fills the supplies of that

9538.92 --> 9543.960000000001
organ if you eat that organ

9541.319 --> 9547.58
that's pretty much what happens

9543.96 --> 9547.58
like at least with the liver

9550.979 --> 9557.72
I mean liver is a big storage unit for

9553.68 --> 9557.720000000001
all kinds of fats and all that

9559.2 --> 9565.7
and minerals and pretty much everything

9562.2 --> 9568.140000000001
liberal liberals store anything

9565.7 --> 9570.92
fat related

9568.14 --> 9570.92
and the Jason

9576.96 --> 9583.58
calcium I don't know more color

9581.04 --> 9583.580000000002
foreign

9585.62 --> 9590.160000000002
magnesium I'm pretty sure that magnesium

9588.18 --> 9591.24
is not going to do any kind of harm like

9590.16 --> 9594.18
that

9591.24 --> 9596.939
but maybe if you get like too much

9594.18 --> 9598.62
calcium at the same time like you ate a

9596.939 --> 9600.18
lot of it yeah then it will probably

9598.62 --> 9603.42
start to have

9600.18 --> 9606.06
weird influences

9603.42 --> 9608.899
because you need calcium but only a very

9606.06 --> 9608.899
little bit really

9609.0 --> 9612.92
so I think that you could overdo it

9616.92 --> 9621.12
you could probably overdo the Magnesium

9618.96 --> 9623.899
too but I mean yeah that's not gonna

9621.12 --> 9623.899000000001
happen quickly

9624.24 --> 9629.72
you need more magnesium than calcium I

9627.6 --> 9629.720000000001
think

9639.359 --> 9642.859
right anyway man

9642.96 --> 9647.58
let's turn into the food show again but

9645.479 --> 9650.22
I love that it's it's great to talk

9647.58 --> 9652.74
about those things

9650.22 --> 9654.72
like it's never a waste of time you

9652.74 --> 9657.42
always learn something you always can

9654.72 --> 9659.58
reflect upon like oh well wow I learned

9657.42 --> 9661.8
that from my parents or

9659.58 --> 9663.96
or figure out like wait I learned a

9661.8 --> 9665.22
really bad habit I thought it was right

9663.96 --> 9667.259999999998
but it wasn't

9665.22 --> 9669.479
there's so much you can learn in food

9667.26 --> 9671.460000000001
it's it's never really a waste of time

9669.479 --> 9673.199999999999
to talk about it unless it's the only

9671.46 --> 9676.099999999999
thing you're gonna talk about and then

9673.2 --> 9679.139000000001
it gets a bit repetitive eventually

9676.1 --> 9679.139000000001
[Music]

9681.66 --> 9690.8
gonna make some cell cut prize

9686.3 --> 9690.8
self cut oh you made them oh nice

9693.06 --> 9698.1
cool well that sounds nice mystical Rock

9696.06 --> 9700.019999999999
Hound I'm kind of hungry myself right

9698.1 --> 9702.359
now

9700.02 --> 9703.859
so I'm probably gonna round out the show

9702.359 --> 9706.74
soon to

9703.859 --> 9709.939
make some proper lunch or brunch

9706.74 --> 9709.939

foreign

9752.12 --> 9755.279

9766.5 --> 9769.7
never a waste of time

9770.22 --> 9774.119999999999
hmm

9772.04 --> 9775.859
yeah it's funny mystical Rock under

9774.12 --> 9778.560000000001
that's how my dad used to make it too

9775.859 --> 9782.04
he'd cut his own potatoes and then fry

9778.56 --> 9785.699999999999
it into in two parts like that

9782.04 --> 9787.880000000001
I'm way too lazy I I get just a bag of

9785.7 --> 9787.880000000001
it

9795.66 --> 9799.619999999999
but yeah admirable

9801.899 --> 9806.699999999999
like

9804.24 --> 9809.28
french fries that you're gonna make from

9806.7 --> 9810.960000000001
scratch they are they always do turn out

9809.28 --> 9815.12
different though

9810.96 --> 9815.119999999999
than like the packaged ones

9817.34 --> 9823.319
it's kind of tricky to do it right my

9820.68 --> 9826.380000000001
dad was pretty good at it

9823.319 --> 9829.68
but I mean to be fair I still pref just

9826.38 --> 9831.839999999998
the pre-package I do still prefer them I

9829.68 --> 9834.42
just do

9831.84 --> 9835.979
they usually turn out like a little

9834.42 --> 9838.859
crunchier

9835.979 --> 9841.26
maybe that's because they were frozen

9838.859 --> 9843.439
when they get in I don't know what that

9841.26 --> 9843.439
is

9847.5 --> 9849.5
um

9854.22 --> 9860.479
variety of potato matters okay

9857.64 --> 9860.479
