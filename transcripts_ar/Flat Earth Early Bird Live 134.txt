202.34 --> 209.87
new guest but we'll see where that goes

207.47 --> 214.909
so yeah yesterday and made another

209.87 --> 216.799
mistake a really annoying one so let me

214.909 --> 222.44
share you another one of our wins epic

216.799 --> 225.68
mistakes so yeah it was getting kind of

222.44 --> 228.47
late I think 11 o'clock something and it

225.68 --> 232.06
was just watching YouTube videos and

228.47 --> 237.31
info wars and all kinds of stuff and

232.06 --> 240.889
drinking some and then I fell asleep and

237.31 --> 248.06
then suddenly I realized oh [ __ ] I left

240.889 --> 251.03
stuff on the fire and yep so now my

248.06 --> 253.549
hallway smells like really really badly

251.03 --> 256.699
burned potatoes and I yeah almost

253.549 --> 259.43
completely burned out a pan which is

256.699 --> 263.74
kind of too bad because it was so bad

259.43 --> 266.479
this time yeah no man no manual of

263.74 --> 270.05
sandpaper sponges or anything is gonna

266.479 --> 272.0
fix that pan that's gonna be like at

270.05 --> 274.31
least two hour at least two hours

272.0 --> 276.949
scrubbing to get it kind of usable again

274.31 --> 278.3
yeah so that's not gonna work either I'm

276.949 --> 284.06
gonna have to get a new one

278.3 --> 289.789
oh well shouldn't be too expensive but

284.06 --> 293.62
yeah another one of goody there stupid

289.789 --> 293.62
mistakes are not over yet

294.08 --> 298.289
so yeah

295.619 --> 301.619
don't start cooking and then take a

298.289 --> 304.679
break we leave it all on the fire pretty

301.619 --> 307.439
low fire mind you well yeah low fire for

304.679 --> 314.99899999999997
four hours is still gonna turn out in

307.439 --> 316.83000000000004
just charcoal burned [ __ ] yeah so don't

314.999 --> 320.36
fall asleep while cooking that's

316.83 --> 320.35999999999996
basically my advice for today

330.46 --> 343.41999999999996
yeah but yeah I was funny I was looking

336.1 --> 345.52000000000004
for new pants new pans and looking on a

343.42 --> 347.86
typical online shop where I always get

345.52 --> 350.97999999999996
them and there were other types of pens

347.86 --> 353.59000000000003
that I really use a lot and it was like

350.98 --> 358.63
a great deal like buy one get one for

353.59 --> 361.33
free so that was like whoa really didn't

358.63 --> 363.79
expect that but apparently me burning

361.33 --> 365.74
that pan really badly got me to look at

363.79 --> 369.1
a time when I just suddenly got these

365.74 --> 373.3
pants that I use a lot use them all the

369.1 --> 375.79
time and yeah now I'm getting two new

373.3 --> 378.43
pants for a very cheap price and gonna

375.79 --> 380.23
be very happy with still need to replace

378.43 --> 382.27
the other one though but I'll just try

380.23 --> 386.77000000000004
to see if I can find something right in

382.27 --> 392.95
the store but yeah synchronicities I

386.77 --> 395.46999999999997
guess with with some accidents some

392.95 --> 400.06
positive things may roll out of it I

395.47 --> 402.25
guess so oh well unfortunately it won't

400.06 --> 404.14
make my hallway stink any less it's

402.25 --> 405.91
probably gonna smell really bad for at

404.14 --> 410.5
least another week it wasn't that

405.91 --> 415.45000000000005
terrible like you couldn't see smoke

410.5 --> 417.82
really but almost yeah it wasn't like

415.45 --> 424.42
really burning burning it was just total

417.82 --> 427.36
charcoal smoke terrible [ __ ] yeah yeah

424.42 --> 431.89000000000004
leb drinking and cooking don't really

427.36 --> 433.96000000000004
mix that well it the funny thing is it

431.89 --> 436.33
can kind of work if you do it they had

433.96 --> 439.06
the French style I call it or they met

436.33 --> 442.59999999999997
it Mediterranean style and just drink

439.06 --> 445.18
some wine during the cooking but yeah if

442.6 --> 449.02000000000004
you overdo it and half way you have like

445.18 --> 451.51
I need oh the alcohol so strong I need

449.02 --> 454.53999999999996
to lay down that's when you get into

451.51 --> 457.24
trouble now of course mediterranean

454.54 --> 459.51000000000005
people they can take a lot of wine on

457.24 --> 461.71000000000004
average so they don't have that problem

459.51 --> 466.75
unfortunately I'm Dutch

461.71 --> 470.039
not really Mediterranean so I do it's

466.75 --> 471.85
better to cook and then get some wine

470.039 --> 478.229
when you're finished

471.85 --> 478.22900000000004
but yeah well

478.93 --> 482.129
[Music]

485.41 --> 490.459
[Music]

487.759 --> 493.849
I'm just really glad that I was smart

490.459 --> 496.009
enough to put the fire on the on really

493.849 --> 499.99899999999997
low and not hard because if it was on

496.009 --> 502.58000000000004
hard then yeah I might have had a hot

499.999 --> 507.309
glowing pan kind of scenario which is

502.58 --> 507.30899999999997
like pretty [ __ ] up so

512.39 --> 519.12
all right in Galatia it's gonna try to

516.21 --> 520.74
get in the panel you through his mobile

519.12 --> 525.32
because he can't get his microphone at

520.74 --> 525.32
work well we'll see

533.44 --> 542.4200000000001
ouais cloud I don't know if Dutch chicks

538.04 --> 546.56
are cheap dates I've never really done

542.42 --> 548.8
that the whole dating thing really no

546.56 --> 555.65
I've never have never really done that

548.8 --> 558.89
thinking about it but yeah all the

555.65 --> 563.6
chicks that I've had relationships with

558.89 --> 565.8199999999999
I pretty much just ran into them met

563.6 --> 570.83
them somehow and it just clicked

565.82 --> 573.38
immediately and that's just I've gotten

570.83 --> 576.74
my relationships with my ex - it just

573.38 --> 579.62
went to a party she was there she was

576.74 --> 582.83
freaking amazing hot and I was like okay

579.62 --> 586.25
I'm gonna hit myself in the face if I at

582.83 --> 588.8000000000001
least don't try to just say hello and

586.25 --> 593.39
see if she likes me and well she liked

588.8 --> 596.51
me so I was a very happy guy from that

593.39 --> 598.97
moment on and already kind of worried

596.51 --> 601.34
like oh [ __ ] if this one's gonna leave I

598.97 --> 604.52
will be messed up I already knew that in

601.34 --> 607.1600000000001
advance I that's an unfortunate or

604.52 --> 609.5
fortunate side-effect it's a matter of

607.16 --> 614.12
perspective that soon as I fall in love

609.5 --> 616.18
I know like oh [ __ ] this is gonna this

614.12 --> 618.59
is gonna end up sucking really bad

616.18 --> 620.5699999999999
because I usually figure out pretty

618.59 --> 623.6
early on that it's not gonna work on the

620.57 --> 627.35
long run in this case because yeah she

623.6 --> 630.2
didn't want to have kids and that was a

627.35 --> 637.07
big problem because it's like damn it

630.2 --> 641.2
such a talented beautiful woman that's

637.07 --> 641.2
what I want kids with but she didn't

641.24 --> 644.92
oh well

653.76 --> 661.04
yeah yeah and prostitution is not not

659.43 --> 664.6099999999999
really my thing either

661.04 --> 664.61
never tried it

668.66 --> 677.9599999999999
now at this time I guess to classify me

674.15 --> 685.16
and my relationship behavior I'm pretty

677.96 --> 690.1700000000001
much a false L because my attitude at it

685.16 --> 694.4
is just like yeah I could screw around

690.17 --> 697.9699999999999
but it's gonna distract me hugely it's

694.4 --> 700.73
gonna force me to step away from the

697.97 --> 704.1800000000001
path and the principles because it

700.73 --> 713.38
always does unless it's the right one

704.18 --> 713.38
and yeah I don't know

715.149 --> 722.139
it just doesn't appeal to me so badly

718.449 --> 725.549
that I would go out of my way to to

722.139 --> 729.639
change myself and engage in some kind of

725.549 --> 733.059
superficial relationship with a hope

729.639 --> 735.759
that it might become more because I see

733.059 --> 738.699
a lot of people do that like I do pay

735.759 --> 742.509
attention to pretty much everyone and

738.699 --> 747.7289999999999
their relationships how that goes it's

742.509 --> 754.149
very tiresome often and I'm like okay

747.729 --> 756.729
you know what I'll just be me I'll think

754.149 --> 758.409
about women and I'll look at them and

756.729 --> 761.7990000000001
they'll be like oh yeah you're pretty

758.409 --> 765.669
hot but that's it I don't really need

761.799 --> 770.819
more out of it and a if they want more

765.669 --> 777.699
out of it that's something else you know

770.819 --> 786.909
if if I'm in resistible to certain

777.699 --> 793.2389999999999
females then yeah you can always try so

786.909 --> 796.7189999999999
I think class Shaw is back still not

793.239 --> 803.739
hearing anything though still not

796.719 --> 806.349
hearing you man oh by the way now I'm

803.739 --> 809.139
realizing this yeah this could be the

806.349 --> 811.119
freaking YouTube glitch that I'm

809.139 --> 813.999
specifically experiencing for some

811.119 --> 816.429
reason so I'm gonna if that's okay with

813.999 --> 821.679
you glass show I'm gonna Skype call you

816.429 --> 823.179
and then get your Skype thing on instead

821.679 --> 825.759
of Google Hangouts how about that

823.179 --> 827.289
because I'm just getting zero sound

825.759 --> 829.689
through and I'm now starting to wonder

827.289 --> 834.459
if that's me or if it's you it's

829.689 --> 835.449
probably me so okay thanks for trying

834.459 --> 839.949
anyway

835.449 --> 842.639
Google what are you doing with what are

839.949 --> 842.639
you doing man

843.829 --> 849.3889999999999
it's just there's no sound for so it

847.829 --> 852.75
happened on the debates and now it's

849.389 --> 859.259
happening here I don't know why do not

852.75 --> 863.75
know anyway yeah I'm gonna just Skype

859.259 --> 863.75
call him and I need to rearrange

867.949 --> 872.1089999999999
let's see how do I do that again

885.15 --> 889.56
it's a

887.19 --> 892.7900000000001

889.56 --> 892.79

1208.73 --> 1217.65
I'm not sure I do remember

1213.83 --> 1220.83
hmm excuse me what really got me into it

1217.65 --> 1224.0400000000002
was like all in 2010 there's millions of

1220.83 --> 1225.96
UFO videos all over but like where were

1224.04 --> 1228.51
they coming from they weren't coming

1225.96 --> 1233.19
from space or nothing obviously but and

1228.51 --> 1234.45
that what interests me a lot yeah yeah I

1233.19 --> 1236.67
yeah me too

1234.45 --> 1238.47
well I wasn't really focusing too much

1236.67 --> 1241.89
on it back then because I already got

1238.47 --> 1243.15
into creationism and other yeah

1241.89 --> 1247.26
directions of

1243.15 --> 1249.7800000000002
Laure but yet the whole UFO thing that

1247.26 --> 1253.52
came pretty much out of the 90s I was

1249.78 --> 1255.33
yea into that too and there was already

1253.52 --> 1259.02
science that they could be

1255.33 --> 1262.76
interdimensional somehow that yeah that

1259.02 --> 1265.83
was the angle that I caught on back then

1262.76 --> 1268.11
so and then I started watching like

1265.83 --> 1271.08
World War two documentaries wondering

1268.11 --> 1272.85
where all the Nazi films and things were

1271.08 --> 1274.74
being took in in Antarctica and then it

1272.85 --> 1280.6499999999999
just went to a dead end and I found out

1274.74 --> 1283.5
flat earth flat Point Blank yeah that's

1280.65 --> 1286.65
weird isn't it it's like Oh things in

1283.5 --> 1288.69
Antarctica and then suddenly yeah you

1286.65 --> 1291.69
don't really hear anything specific

1288.69 --> 1293.88
anymore not nothing about locations

1291.69 --> 1297.72
there or anything it's just like yeah

1293.88 --> 1304.5590000000002
they went there and then they're gone we

1297.72 --> 1306.9
don't know what happened and yeah if you

1304.559 --> 1309.96
probably also heard about that what was

1306.9 --> 1313.98
it again it's a Philadelphia Experiment

1309.96 --> 1315.72
I think the ship the military ship that

1313.98 --> 1318.24
was subjected to some weird

1315.72 --> 1320.7
electromagnetic frequency experiment

1318.24 --> 1323.28
something like that and it kind of like

1320.7 --> 1325.92
vanished or something and then

1323.28 --> 1329.04
reappeared in people were fused in the

1325.92 --> 1331.29
deck and [ __ ] it was very creepy have

1329.04 --> 1333.09
you ever heard of that yeah I've heard

1331.29 --> 1334.83
of that and I looked into it for awhile

1333.09 --> 1339.9289999999999
but I just believe it was like a

1334.83 --> 1342.62
cloaking device they were working on all

1339.929 --> 1345.69
right well could be a purpose for it

1342.62 --> 1347.37
it's like okay you're gonna hide in the

1345.69 --> 1349.1100000000001
other dimension you're gonna hide in

1347.37 --> 1351.4199999999998
another frequency yeah you're not a lot

1349.11 --> 1355.02
you're no longer visible you're actually

1351.42 --> 1357.48
doing a really freaky [ __ ] but yeah you

1355.02 --> 1359.6399999999999
could then use that as a cloaking device

1357.48 --> 1361.5
it's like yeah using the one ring as a

1359.64 --> 1362.3400000000001
cloaking device yeah you go into the

1361.5 --> 1364.98
Shadow Realm

1362.34 --> 1367.32
you're not literally physically there

1364.98 --> 1372.54
anymore well yeah you can use it as a

1367.32 --> 1374.76
cloaking device technically but yeah and

1372.54 --> 1376.11
soon probably was just obviously untrue

1374.76 --> 1378.57
hmm

1376.11 --> 1380.37
the cloaking is like tricking something

1378.57 --> 1383.72
- so they're trying to trick the

1380.37 --> 1388.1899999999998
magnetic mines not to hit the boats oh

1383.72 --> 1393.029
yeah that's a good point yeah basically

1388.19 --> 1395.01
bypassing physic physical yeah issues by

1393.029 --> 1400.019
just physically not literally being

1395.01 --> 1401.49
there anymore yeah yeah that that sounds

1400.019 --> 1403.799
really interesting never thought about

1401.49 --> 1405.269
that it makes you think a lot like

1403.799 --> 1410.48
they're a lot smarter than they were

1405.269 --> 1413.549
telling the press even of course but

1410.48 --> 1416.75
yeah that was it was secret experiments

1413.549 --> 1420.539
pretty it was very secret back then and

1416.75 --> 1422.07
yeah whenever they reveal some kind of

1420.539 --> 1423.72
experiment happened they're never going

1422.07 --> 1425.49
to really give the full picture because

1423.72 --> 1430.5
that might give other groups some kind

1425.49 --> 1432.299
of idea now I live in the United States

1430.5 --> 1435.87
they can just privatized it they don't

1432.299 --> 1437.779
even have to watch it they can just have

1435.87 --> 1441.51
somebody else do it

1437.779 --> 1443.85
what do you mean like instead of them

1441.51 --> 1445.169
taking full control and building

1443.85 --> 1446.58
something they'll just pay someone else

1445.169 --> 1448.7
to build it then they don't have to

1446.58 --> 1451.6999999999998
watch it like guard it or anything

1448.7 --> 1451.7
private

1452.19 --> 1459.63
you mean like comparable to a Elon Musk

1456.74 --> 1462.51
yeah privatized

1459.63 --> 1467.5490000000002
like damn here like the responsibility

1462.51 --> 1470.37
yep then going that way for a long time

1467.549 --> 1472.01
all right it is kind of efficient and it

1470.37 --> 1476.6689999999999
evades a lot of issues with

1472.01 --> 1480.98
responsibility so yeah makes

1476.669 --> 1483.8600000000001
millionaires - how bad it does

1480.98 --> 1488.3600000000001

1586.299 --> 1588.91
few others

it's just that I'm overwhelmed right now

1588.91 --> 1595.69
being it this is my first time talking

1590.83 --> 1599.6689999999999
on webcam anywhere mm-hmm right yeah

don't go fall asleep during cooking just

1623.41 --> 1635.65
not good but yeah it's nice and sunny

1629.26 --> 1637.36
today and I feel kind of good yeah I'm

1635.65 --> 1638.77
just waiting for it to get nice here so

1637.36 --> 1644.29
I can go for a walk and take some

1638.77 --> 1648.82
pictures man hmm yeah so do you think

1644.29 --> 1651.3999999999999
about Argentina buddy Oh from what not

1648.82 --> 1654.61
from what angle what about it from like

1651.4 --> 1657.3600000000001
route down like that is like amazing I

1654.61 --> 1661.809
would love to go see that place sometime

1657.36 --> 1663.85
right well I think that the entirety of

1661.809 --> 1669.1299999999999
South America is pretty fascinating

1663.85 --> 1672.9099999999999
continent overall with amazing ancient

1669.13 --> 1675.419
nature and a wide variety of different

1672.91 --> 1678.97
types of landscapes and forests and

1675.419 --> 1684.1000000000001
rainforests and cultures ancient

1678.97 --> 1687.549
cultures yeah so yeah really really is

1684.1 --> 1690.04
amazing and Argentina would be nice

1687.549 --> 1694.72
you'll see all that someday yeah would

1690.04 --> 1696.6689999999999
definitely but I can't afford some poor

1694.72 --> 1698.799
so I gotta watch it on like Google Earth

1696.669 --> 1701.5490000000002
or something or possibly your channel so

1698.799 --> 1706.11
it makes it a lot like I'm almost there

1701.549 --> 1706.11
right yeah I agree

1706.79 --> 1715.62
it's I'm kind of in the same package I I

1710.96 --> 1718.13
haven't really been on vacation anywhere

1715.62 --> 1721.9399999999998
outside of my country for a long time

1718.13 --> 1721.94
because it's so expensive

1722.81 --> 1727.49
let's go on world tour that'd be fun

1728.27 --> 1736.35
maybe maybe at some point I'll do it

1732.96 --> 1741.95
something like that flat earth world 2

1736.35 --> 1745.74
or 2020 you get your tickets now mm-hmm

1741.95 --> 1748.04
well a world tour crews would be pretty

1745.74 --> 1756.75
damn cool that's for sure

1748.04 --> 1759.54
how about a World Tour airship fly as

1756.75 --> 1766.02
low nice it's not the hydrogen balloon

1759.54 --> 1769.2
base but yeah maybe you like a giant

1766.02 --> 1775.56
Zeppelin helium or something that would

1769.2 --> 1777.5900000000001
be kind of fun just imagine all the flat

1775.56 --> 1781.76
earthers all loaded with cameras just

1777.59 --> 1784.8799999999999
like a giant media fan just staring

1781.76 --> 1788.6299999999999
outside the window

1784.88 --> 1790.98
that'd be great it would be kind of cool

1788.63 --> 1793.5
another thing that's been like going

1790.98 --> 1796.65
through my mind is like Africa in the

1793.5 --> 1798.89
Congo that place is built up - what's up

1796.65 --> 1798.89
with that

1800.57 --> 1810.2
wait the Congo Africa sorry yeah that

1804.75 --> 1813.48
looks all castled up buddy cache hold up

1810.2 --> 1818.69
yeah there's lots of castles in Africa -

1813.48 --> 1821.6100000000001
what what type of castles

1818.69 --> 1824.8400000000001
star forts all kinds of them alright

1821.61 --> 1830.5089999999998
star forts well no surprise there I

1824.84 --> 1830.509
think there are some good hints that

1831.289 --> 1840.389
that that the Tartarian Empire probably

1836.789 --> 1843.139
had colonies there at the time quite

1840.389 --> 1847.4989999999998
elaborately until they were just

1843.139 --> 1850.289
colonies hmm I said it's all colony is

1847.499 --> 1855.259
everywhere you look it's like isolated

1850.289 --> 1855.259
colonies on every continent yeah

1856.279 --> 1862.169
thousands of years ahead of everybody

1858.119 --> 1865.019
else - well thousands of year we don't

1862.169 --> 1867.2990000000002
really know if it's thousands of years I

1865.019 --> 1871.289
think that it is still all pretty much

1867.299 --> 1873.929
post-flood but yeah on the other hand in

1871.289 --> 1879.84
the Atlantean age before the flood there

1873.929 --> 1881.8500000000001
was already so much built so yeah the

1879.84 --> 1885.869
Atlanteans were probably everywhere

1881.85 --> 1887.82
having their own little capitals on

1885.869 --> 1889.499
every continent that kind of thing and I

1887.82 --> 1893.21
think that their Terrans probably just

1889.499 --> 1899.22
played into that and did the same thing

1893.21 --> 1901.919
post flood oh yeah buddy y'all doing

1899.22 --> 1905.3990000000001
good jobs man I love hear from everyone

1901.919 --> 1906.8690000000001
all sides of this flatter stuff because

1905.399 --> 1909.049
that's where we're actually getting

1906.869 --> 1909.049
somewhere

1910.46 --> 1914.159
yeah

1911.759 --> 1917.7
knowing the past it it's remarkable

1914.159 --> 1921.0590000000002
because everybody knows like you got to

1917.7 --> 1923.94
learn from the past so you don't repeat

1921.059 --> 1926.9289999999999
it but yeah to learn from the past you

1923.94 --> 1930.0800000000002
actually got to know what was there and

1926.929 --> 1934.279
realized that so much has been removed

1930.08 --> 1936.99
entirely from the picture of history

1934.279 --> 1944.549
probably so that we can't learn from it

1936.99 --> 1947.159
and we have a tricky thing I believe in

1944.549 --> 1949.49
nature too cuz nature don't lie like man

1947.159 --> 1949.49
does

1952.94 --> 1958.289
in what sense

1955.279 --> 1960.929
well tree groans of ring and you know it

1958.289 --> 1968.8799999999999
grew a man tells a lie and no one

1960.929 --> 1974.8200000000002
questions that well maybe because they

1968.88 --> 1979.1100000000001
don't need to yeah I've never thought of

1974.82 --> 1983.73
it like that the questioning is

1979.11 --> 1987.029
confronting and if it's more efficient

1983.73 --> 1989.88
to not confront and just let it happen

1987.029 --> 1992.61
let it slide past and you flourish that

1989.88 --> 1995.49
way then yeah that's why a lot of lies

1992.61 --> 1997.86
are just let happen it's always during

1995.49 --> 2000.919
the good times though good times are

1997.86 --> 2004.6999999999998
there politicians get nutty get crazy

2000.919 --> 2007.73
get outrageous maybe not too bad but

2004.7 --> 2009.559
still outrageous or out of tone and

2007.73 --> 2014.51
people are just like huh the damn

2009.559 --> 2016.8799999999999
politicians but yeah just leave they're

2014.51 --> 2019.7
just talking crazy just don't let it get

2016.88 --> 2022.3700000000001
out of hand and and don't think about it

2019.7 --> 2025.3700000000001
too much and just focus on on the good

2022.37 --> 2027.9799999999998
times and then eventually it gets really

2025.37 --> 2029.6899999999998
bad and then it's like dammit why didn't

2027.98 --> 2032.57
we do anything about these stupid

2029.69 --> 2033.98
politicians that are continually making

2032.57 --> 2035.6589999999999
it worse and we're now seeing the

2033.98 --> 2037.3700000000001
pattern of how they're making it worse

2035.659 --> 2040.8200000000002
and we didn't see it back then because

2037.37 --> 2045.649
everything was so good and yeah

2040.82 --> 2047.45
eventually eventually confrontation will

2045.649 --> 2053.75
have to happen because there is no

2047.45 --> 2055.94
advantage to let it slide anymore well I

2053.75 --> 2059.69
never thought of it that way good point

2055.94 --> 2063.71
Arwen very good point right societal

2059.69 --> 2066.9500000000003
dynamics group decision is very

2063.71 --> 2070.23
different from individual decision yet

2066.95 --> 2072.45
we're all subjected to it

2070.23 --> 2074.28
that's why I think this is working so

2072.45 --> 2077.8199999999997
well because we're all individuals and

2074.28 --> 2080.8390000000004
we're not all the same yes yes we are

2077.82 --> 2080.839
all individuals

2081.23 --> 2087.619
sorry it's every time somebody says that

2083.94 --> 2090.149
I always have to think of Life of Brian

2087.619 --> 2091.9500000000003
remember when he opens the window and

2090.149 --> 2095.3689999999997
starts blaming like no you have to

2091.95 --> 2099.6189999999997
follow your own thing you're all

2095.369 --> 2106.71
individuals yes yes we are all

2099.619 --> 2114.119
individuals tell us what to do good work

2106.71 --> 2116.94
buddy thanks but right live buddy about

2114.119 --> 2119.28
I'd say three four hundred miles north

2116.94 --> 2121.7400000000002
there's old copper mines that they

2119.28 --> 2127.92
deemed that's where all the copper wet

2121.74 --> 2136.3489999999997
is in Egypt - that took them three years

2127.92 --> 2138.81
to get it wait what what a livable like

2136.349 --> 2141.869
the copper that they grow or needed for

2138.81 --> 2146.21
the pyramids they stole out of Lake

2141.869 --> 2148.77
Superior in mines and stuff it stole it

2146.21 --> 2154.19
yeah they came through took it all and

2148.77 --> 2156.45
left no really took it from a thirteen

2154.19 --> 2161.369
here but they took it like all the

2156.45 --> 2167.819
copper in Houghton County there's still

2161.369 --> 2169.56
like pits all over but how do you mean

2167.819 --> 2171.15
took it took it from other people or

2169.56 --> 2173.819
they just mined it

2171.15 --> 2176.28
my dad moved out of here they just

2173.819 --> 2178.8
uncovered a scroll I think last week and

2176.28 --> 2180.5690000000004
Egypt depicting it - you have to look it

2178.8 --> 2185.6600000000003
up on YouTube it's there somewhere

2180.569 --> 2185.66
hi interesting all right

2186.91 --> 2195.5299999999997
well probably fixing up the pyramids did

2190.31 --> 2197.96
require a lot of work oh yeah because

2195.53 --> 2201.65
yeah I don't think it was built after

2197.96 --> 2204.92
the flood really I think it was probably

2201.65 --> 2206.84
restored after the flood because I think

2204.92 --> 2210.62
that the Atlanteans built most of the

2206.84 --> 2213.59
pyramid frameworks as hydro electric

2210.62 --> 2215.72
devices to sustain the Giants that also

2213.59 --> 2220.06
helped build them and then after the

2215.72 --> 2223.0099999999998
flood yeah I just it malfunctioned and

2220.06 --> 2225.74
like the the toppings of the pyramids

2223.01 --> 2228.17
got washed away and all that and I think

2225.74 --> 2230.5099999999998
that posted post Atlantis

2228.17 --> 2235.64
maybe the Tarte Aryans or some other

2230.51 --> 2240.6200000000003
group they restored it so they basically

2235.64 --> 2242.75
rebuild the pyramid I bet you that's a

2240.62 --> 2245.23
really big pyramid once they clear the

2242.75 --> 2249.14
sand out the bottom of it

2245.23 --> 2251.33
my huge what do you mean like that the

2249.14 --> 2255.23
pyramids are just the top of that thing

2251.33 --> 2258.0099999999998
buddy there's still I don't know floors

2255.23 --> 2261.8
below it right yeah it is embedded

2258.01 --> 2264.7900000000004
definitely mm hm there's also like water

2261.8 --> 2266.1200000000003
channels in there you knew that right oh

2264.79 --> 2270.37
yeah

2266.12 --> 2270.37
and that's the hydraloop part of it

2270.52 --> 2275.69
that's a good story that one I like that

2273.23 --> 2278.09
yeah you did you see the pyramid code

2275.69 --> 2279.46
the miniseries it's been out since I

2278.09 --> 2281.84
didn't hear you

2279.46 --> 2288.67
did you see the pyramid code the

2281.84 --> 2288.67
miniseries and came out in 2001 oh yeah

2288.79 --> 2297.71
sorry sorry what tons of books on

2295.31 --> 2303.65
pyramids ever since I was in high school

2297.71 --> 2306.32
till this very day hmm yeah well there's

2303.65 --> 2309.29
so many theories about pyramids for a

2306.32 --> 2311.71
long long time but the pyramid code that

2309.29 --> 2317.09
was the first documentary that gave a

2311.71 --> 2319.52
well an alien [ __ ] creation it was

2317.09 --> 2321.65
so technical it was so technical you

2319.52 --> 2324.02
saying look this is how it's designed

2321.65 --> 2326.9900000000002
this is kind of how it works this is the

2324.02 --> 2329.3
type of technology that was applied this

2326.99 --> 2330.89
is the technology they had to design

2329.3 --> 2333.7400000000002
these things and that is this is

2330.89 --> 2335.69
probably the function and and just left

2333.74 --> 2338.66
it to that and had some historical

2335.69 --> 2343.12
references from a very ancient guy a

2338.66 --> 2347.35
local that that had the old story that

2343.12 --> 2350.2999999999997
wasn't yeah it wasn't hunted down yet

2347.35 --> 2353.63
the guy did get killed by the way like

2350.3 --> 2356.78
right after he did that so that was kind

2353.63 --> 2359.51
of tragic and suspicious and he was

2356.78 --> 2362.0
probably caught for it but yeah the

2359.51 --> 2365.21
pyramid God made a huge impression on me

2362.0 --> 2371.06
I think it's one of the more valuable

2365.21 --> 2375.89
historical miniseries about the pyramid

2371.06 --> 2378.7999999999997
it is like it is 90s BBC quality but not

2375.89 --> 2384.2
of the BBC even though the narrator is

2378.8 --> 2385.4
very Oxford English woman so it had the

2384.2 --> 2388.8799999999997
British feel to it

2385.4 --> 2391.79
but it was yeah any made movie man I

2388.88 --> 2393.98
love them they're good you're good watch

2391.79 --> 2396.38
any of them at least when you watch a

2393.98 --> 2406.36
pyramid movie or show you get smarter at

2396.38 --> 2408.92
the end of it ha I don't know about that

2406.36 --> 2412.19
how many times you watch the pyramid

2408.92 --> 2416.42
like documentary and felt smarter at the

2412.19 --> 2419.12
end of it well documentaries why'd it

2416.42 --> 2422.27
all depends on if they're gonna claim

2419.12 --> 2426.56
that slaves built them using copper

2422.27 --> 2429.35
tools and that kind of nonsense that

2426.56 --> 2431.48
they use their myths to drag that that

2429.35 --> 2433.7599999999998
is so embarrassing so no that actually

2431.48 --> 2437.23
makes me feel a lot stupider afterwards

2433.76 --> 2440.3300000000004
but as soon as they get serious and they

2437.23 --> 2444.32
like get Atlanteans involved or ancient

2440.33 --> 2446.69
technology as soon as they nudge towards

2444.32 --> 2449.57
that then yeah that's that's quite a

2446.69 --> 2453.349
thrill every time but as soon as I

2449.57 --> 2455.509
started to go with the official original

2453.349 --> 2457.13
narrative [ __ ] it's just so

2455.509 --> 2461.449
embarrassing like oh my god

2457.13 --> 2463.699
archaeologists found found a corpse

2461.449 --> 2465.829
basically sitting next to the the

2463.699 --> 2469.099
pyramid oh now we know how old it is

2465.829 --> 2473.059
that kind of [ __ ] yeah I don't believe

2469.099 --> 2475.3590000000004
that really you got a point there our

2473.059 --> 2477.9790000000003
way all right

2475.359 --> 2479.9
but yeah the pyramid code I can

2477.979 --> 2482.8689999999997
definitely recommend it as for where you

2479.9 --> 2486.9790000000003
can find that that miniseries I don't

2482.869 --> 2488.869
know I first saw it on Google video that

2486.979 --> 2493.839
no longer exists by the way it was taken

2488.869 --> 2496.9100000000003
down I think in 2006 or something 2007 I

2493.839 --> 2500.089
have the mini series on my computer

2496.91 --> 2504.949
though so yes

2500.089 --> 2506.979
yeah I can share it a through Skype why

2504.949 --> 2509.9790000000003
don't you do premiere that one night

2506.979 --> 2513.049
it's copyrighted

2509.979 --> 2516.41
damn I'm pretty damn sure it's

2513.049 --> 2520.249
copyrighted and well worth it so I'm not

2516.41 --> 2522.529
gonna risk just putting it out there it

2520.249 --> 2526.249
is a and it's pretty huge as well it's

2522.529 --> 2531.499
like three hours altogether I think so

2526.249 --> 2535.43
it's gonna be a big premiere but yeah I

2531.499 --> 2538.7889999999998
could pass it on to people oh yeah

2535.43 --> 2541.16
thank you man yeah I'll do my best I

2538.789 --> 2543.4990000000003
have to find it first but I know I have

2541.16 --> 2548.5989999999997
it because even if my computer had

2543.499 --> 2551.779
deleted I have it burned on a DVD myself

2548.599 --> 2554.1800000000003
did that some time ago so I'm not gonna

2551.779 --> 2555.589
lose this and it might be still be out

2554.18 --> 2561.8289999999997
there you know it might still be around

2555.589 --> 2566.119
on Torrance or yeah it could probably be

2561.829 --> 2568.7290000000003
found it's not it's not been highly

2566.119 --> 2571.819
censored or anything because it is kind

2568.729 --> 2574.43
of kind of PC and neutral and there's

2571.819 --> 2577.069
like in these days if you look at it

2574.43 --> 2579.319
that's just very little you can object

2577.069 --> 2581.959
you or say like oh my god no this can't

2579.319 --> 2584.029
be can't be said because everything in

2581.959 --> 2587.1499999999996
there has pretty much already been said

2584.029 --> 2591.11
in every other video but giving it

2587.15 --> 2594.64
own spin and all that [ __ ] but this one

2591.11 --> 2598.19
miniseries is just very very

2594.64 --> 2600.47
down-to-earth compared to wild

2598.19 --> 2602.78
speculation videos about the pyramids

2600.47 --> 2606.02
these days and everything CIA does and

2602.78 --> 2610.4300000000003
ancient aliens and blah now this this

2606.02 --> 2613.16
one is very down-to-earth that's really

2610.43 --> 2615.5
good man yeah well I appreciate being on

2613.16 --> 2617.69
here uh when I have more to talk about I

2615.5 --> 2618.64

2626.69 --> 2632.36
at a time

2627.59 --> 2634.3700000000003

2651.34 --> 2658.61
so yeah that was close sure it's a good

2655.37 --> 2660.88
conversation about pyramids mostly I

2658.61 --> 2660.88
guess

2663.31 --> 2670.7799999999997
so that was kind of cool yeah and hey

2666.94 --> 2672.4900000000002
anyone interested in chat or anyone I

2670.78 --> 2674.32
know on skype hey if you want the

2672.49 --> 2679.27
pyramid code if you want the video I'll

2674.32 --> 2683.55
dig it out for you and yeah you can just

2679.27 --> 2686.83
have the video directly dropped in Skype

2683.55 --> 2690.9700000000003
so you can take a look see how cool this

2686.83 --> 2693.37
movie or this mini series is can drag on

2690.97 --> 2696.64
a little bit though but it's just good

2693.37 --> 2700.0299999999997
it's good footage it's good research and

2696.64 --> 2708.0899999999997
it's credibly old it's like more than 50

2700.03 --> 2708.09
years old now 15 years old so yeah

2708.93 --> 2715.68
anyway that's good to have somebody new

2711.76 --> 2721.75
one if anybody else would like to join

2715.68 --> 2724.6499999999996
I'm all open for it it's gonna have to

2721.75 --> 2724.65
be on skype though

2734.31 --> 2738.17
what are you talking about

2745.17 --> 2754.9500000000003
all right yeah Sean Becker Buddhist

2748.019 --> 2757.109
monks using cymatics for levitation I'm

2754.95 --> 2760.89
not surprised that they learned how to

2757.109 --> 2762.839
do this all right the pyramid code can

2760.89 --> 2765.569
be found on YouTube says Parrish Mike

2762.839 --> 2770.3289999999997
could be I don't know if it's gonna be

2765.569 --> 2770.329
the right one though I'd have to check

2770.569 --> 2773.869
let's see

2780.36 --> 2783.53
[Applause]

2784.23 --> 2787.48
[Music]

2788.89 --> 2803.499
yeah yeah it is there huh posted eight

2795.009 --> 2807.549
months ago hmm cool okay so it can

2803.499 --> 2814.569
actually just be found on YouTube I'll

2807.549 --> 2816.359
post a link the video it's a series one

2814.569 --> 2821.759
five parts

2816.359 --> 2824.589
45 minutes each so here is a link

2821.759 --> 2828.64
there's nothing Flat Earth related it's

2824.589 --> 2831.249
not really mentioned but they don't talk

2828.64 --> 2833.799
globe nonsense either as far as I know

2831.249 --> 2838.569
yeah there are some globe references I

2833.799 --> 2842.65
think they already use Google Earth but

2838.569 --> 2846.73
I thought it was really good at the time

2842.65 --> 2849.63
and yeah it may be a good good thing to

2846.73 --> 2849.63
rewatch it again

2853.09 --> 2858.94
anyway yeah my giant theory the giant

2857.14 --> 2861.3399999999997
and the pyramid the Giants and the

2858.94 --> 2865.09
pyramids in the Atlantean Age that

2861.34 --> 2867.28
concept was pretty much based on what I

2865.09 --> 2869.92
learned from the pyramid code and that

2867.28 --> 2874.21
that idea has been breeding in my mind

2869.92 --> 2879.36
for a long time until I put it out on

2874.21 --> 2879.36
the flat earth talks three years ago

2885.75 --> 2893.58
and yeah it also mentions cymatics and

2890.06 --> 2899.43
sound cutting technology is very

2893.58 --> 2902.12
fascinating and sound healing as well

2899.43 --> 2912.47
sound healing chambers that's also

2902.12 --> 2912.47
treated in the pyramid code yeah

2918.17 --> 2926.349
so yeah do take a look after it's no

2923.089 --> 2926.349
release date on it though

2926.64 --> 2934.02
it doesn't say at least here in the in

2930.03 --> 2936.7400000000002
the YouTube maybe I could look it up at

2934.02 --> 2936.74
IMDB

2945.82 --> 2961.63
Oh 2009 actually hmm right okay so it

2959.44 --> 2966.2200000000003
hasn't been around since 2001 that my

2961.63 --> 2967.51
mistake it was 2009 and I think I pretty

2966.22 --> 2970.2099999999996
much discovered it

2967.51 --> 2972.2400000000002
when it came out back then it was kind

2970.21 --> 2977.25
of mentioned for a short time on

2972.24 --> 2980.7099999999996
conspiracy talk channels and stuff and

2977.25 --> 2983.14
then I picked it up through Google Video

2980.71 --> 2984.94
where everything was dumped immediately

2983.14 --> 2989.56
and there weren't too much too many

2984.94 --> 2992.26
copyright issues back then yet so ya got

2989.56 --> 2994.29
a I got to watch it pretty much right

2992.26 --> 2994.2900000000004
away

2994.68 --> 3010.5
IMDB only gives it a 6.8 just goes to

3003.39 --> 3013.77
show what how they judge things I guess

3010.5 --> 3019.08
that as a movie it is kind of it can or

3013.77 --> 3021.36
as a a film it can be a bit draggy be

3019.08 --> 3023.94
dragging eventually but yeah the content

3021.36 --> 3026.81
is excellent and footage is really

3023.94 --> 3026.81
really nice

3028.97 --> 3031.54
yeah

3035.35 --> 3046.23
hello yeah for for the truth why would

3043.39 --> 3050.1099999999997
you need soldiers to kick alien air arse

3046.23 --> 3055.33
when they have no arses to kick because

3050.11 --> 3058.6
they're not really physical gonna be

3055.33 --> 3061.23
chasing ghosts kick that ghost you're

3058.6 --> 3061.23
always gonna miss

3066.54 --> 3078.42
yeah oh yeah and the Coral Castle was

3074.04 --> 3082.41
also very narrow related with this movie

3078.42 --> 3084.2400000000002
I think they may even mention it at some

3082.41 --> 3085.56
point as a reference I'm not too sure

3084.24 --> 3088.4399999999996
though but yeah

3085.56 --> 3090.62
say in the same Lane like ancient

3088.44 --> 3095.76
technology's site cymatics or

3090.62 --> 3099.72
electrostatic influence to to deal with

3095.76 --> 3102.86
huge stone constructions basically so it

3099.72 --> 3102.8599999999997
is kind of up the same line

3108.41 --> 3112.93
now I don't think a lien Arce's have

3110.599 --> 3112.9300000000003
rights

3119.9 --> 3121.9300000000003
ah

3125.4 --> 3132.13
man this weather is so nice I actually

3129.55 --> 3133.78
before the show started yeah the time

3132.13 --> 3138.12
got really narrow but I was thinking

3133.78 --> 3141.4
like maybe I should just get my laptop

3138.12 --> 3146.3399999999997
plug in the microphone in the webcam and

3141.4 --> 3146.34
just do a hangout on the roof in the Sun

3148.53 --> 3158.19
maybe I'll try that at a later date when

3153.04 --> 3161.62
it's yeah when it's really spring and I

3158.19 --> 3164.14
can't wait until these these trees right

3161.62 --> 3165.72
in front here are gonna be blooming that

3164.14 --> 3169.18
that will be so cool

3165.72 --> 3172.8999999999996
they'll be very cool to see as trees

3169.18 --> 3175.75
down there they'll get full-on pink

3172.9 --> 3178.42
blossom really awesome I think that in

3175.75 --> 3181.48
the I made a spring video a very short

3178.42 --> 3186.07
spring video last year where I showed

3181.48 --> 3190.63
that I would bloomed it's really

3186.07 --> 3194.53
beautiful and then at least I can sit in

3190.63 --> 3197.7400000000002
the Sun while talking it'll be another

3194.53 --> 3201.36
experience because now I'm just like I

3197.74 --> 3201.3599999999997
kind of want to go outside

3204.64 --> 3213.25
no I don't live in an old school no not

3212.77 --> 3219.13
at all

3213.25 --> 3226.09
I live on the top floor of a a flat

3219.13 --> 3228.78
apartment building with for like four

3226.09 --> 3228.78
and a half floors

3230.88 --> 3236.1
but I got a roof to myself that's the

3233.88 --> 3239.2400000000002
funny part you've been yeah I've shown

3236.1 --> 3242.66
you many times how it looks

3239.24 --> 3246.87
dude what is up with your bearded

3242.66 --> 3249.66
hashtag what what I don't have a beard

3246.87 --> 3252.14
what are you talking about this is some

3249.66 --> 3252.14
kind of joke

3258.85 --> 3265.15
we five artists leave our Alice yeah it

3262.06 --> 3268.39
may have the same laundry cheap as

3265.15 --> 3270.84
laundry rack and by the way I'm gone I

3268.39 --> 3274.0
was actually planning to get a new one

3270.84 --> 3277.33
probably today because this thing is

3274.0 --> 3281.29
just the paint is just breaking off and

3277.33 --> 3285.58
it's just a giant it's basically one

3281.29 --> 3288.0099999999998
giant rusty thing now and if I put

3285.58 --> 3290.2599999999998
things on there to dry the rust is gonna

3288.01 --> 3292.57
rub off so it's not good I need to get

3290.26 --> 3302.86
rid of this one because it's just

3292.57 --> 3304.57
totally rusting apart that doesn't

3302.86 --> 3307.51
really look like an old school just

3304.57 --> 3311.7400000000002
looks like a typical Dutch flat

3307.51 --> 3318.48
apartment building they're not super

3311.74 --> 3318.4799999999996
high rise but still multiple floors and

3320.79 --> 3326.17
it's pretty decent living in these types

3323.77 --> 3328.06
of buildings although would be nice to

3326.17 --> 3337.51
actually have an entire apartment and

3328.06 --> 3342.25
not just a freaking room yeah gonna have

3337.51 --> 3344.44
to need to buy one of those and so yeah

3342.25 --> 3346.69
if you want me to a full apartments

3344.44 --> 3350.86
donate to my super chat and my paypal

3346.69 --> 3352.63
and maybe one day I'll get there yeah

3350.86 --> 3360.9100000000003
that one guy it's never gonna happen I

3352.63 --> 3363.9700000000003
can't grow a beard I do have like a fake

3360.91 --> 3367.5099999999998
larper beard that I used once to play

3363.97 --> 3371.1099999999997
dwarf character though but it looks

3367.51 --> 3374.11
ridiculous but yeah it's never gonna

3371.11 --> 3377.85
come out of my chin or maybe in 20 years

3374.11 --> 3377.85
or something if I'm still around then

3380.76 --> 3387.96
mhm yeah lucky you Voynich

3409.72 --> 3414.1189999999997
even fly away when I go outside anymore

3439.52 --> 3446.18
sitting in a tree with his wings like

3441.56 --> 3450.0499999999997
this drying its wings in the Sun that's

3446.18 --> 3455.21

3455.21 --> 3458.93
for like all the creatures out there

[Music]

3481.99 --> 3487.2299999999996
truth if tokine wasn't a flat earther i

3484.57 --> 3487.23

see

3519.48 --> 3523.919
[Music]

3529.68 --> 3536.21

3533.279 --> 3536.21
all NASA stuff

3539.38 --> 3547.38
yeah there that was close blow Buster's

3542.37 --> 3547.38
from yesterday and upload

3554.22 --> 3558.9199999999996
oh crap no

3583.91 --> 3593.359
huh right I see it okay yeah that's no

3589.609 --> 3595.8489999999997
that's not an alien that's a guy

3593.359 --> 3597.89
accidentally becoming visible in the

3595.849 --> 3602.48
trickery set up we're standing right

3597.89 --> 3605.69
behind it can't you see the size of it

3602.48 --> 3609.319
it's literally somebody standing behind

3605.69 --> 3615.819
the thing and still being somewhat

3609.319 --> 3619.839
visible so that seems like a a a

3615.819 --> 3619.839
trickery setup mistake

3637.45 --> 3645.7
let's see if I can show that

3650.809 --> 3656.7690000000002
oh Christ uh-oh

3657.939 --> 3662.949
how do i frickin present something here

3670.73 --> 3681.859
right ha I can do this cool yeah I can

3675.02 --> 3686.15
show you guys just look at it that's a

3681.859 --> 3689.3199999999997
guy that's like behind it it's very

3686.15 --> 3689.32
obvious right

3693.82 --> 3701.4
see how how he moved or that was

3697.18 --> 3701.3999999999996
probably he yeah

3706.26 --> 3715.26
especially how they moved away see ya

3711.69 --> 3720.33
just at looking at the motions you can

3715.26 --> 3724.26
see that's a human-sized person in the

3720.33 --> 3728.91
background and then moving away quickly

3724.26 --> 3734.8500000000004
that type of motion that's I just know

3728.91 --> 3740.3399999999997
what that is you can see it anyway yeah

3734.85 --> 3743.75
and that's a trickery it's everywhere no

3740.34 --> 3743.75
shortage of errors

3771.109 --> 3776.0589999999997
right indeed album uncle indeed you can

3774.259 --> 3781.549
see how small the shell model is it's

3776.059 --> 3786.079
probably this big just because the guy

3781.549 --> 3800.809
is standing behind there and then moving

3786.079 --> 3804.559
away yeah yeah you're welcome

3800.809 --> 3807.3190000000004
it was the footage that that chain

3804.559 --> 3812.38
Walter shared from globe Buster's in

3807.319 --> 3812.38
their intro part of the video

3818.5 --> 3831.01
ah so yeah I was also kind of watching

3823.78 --> 3834.42
Owen Benjamin from this evening I'm at

3831.01 --> 3840.03
3/4 and he had some really awesome

3834.42 --> 3840.03
insights it was it was hilarious again

3840.42 --> 3851.77
like how yeah he made eventually a large

3848.11 --> 3854.67
long winded point about how to treat

3851.77 --> 3858.25
Israel how to like save the situation

3854.67 --> 3861.94
then he said like yeah Israel is a chick

3858.25 --> 3865.09
and just as crazy as a check and you

3861.94 --> 3867.82
need to deal with them as if they're

3865.09 --> 3869.92
like a girlfriend you got to be careful

3867.82 --> 3872.59
but you can't just let him do everything

3869.92 --> 3874.9300000000003
and if you stand up to them then they'll

3872.59 --> 3877.84
show actually respect you for it even

3874.93 --> 3879.94
though they may badmouth you it was

3877.84 --> 3883.3500000000004
amazing it was hilarious and he may have

3879.94 --> 3893.55
actually stumbled upon upon a real a

3883.35 --> 3897.49
real point I thought I was hilarious

3893.55 --> 3901.3500000000004
just yeah just treat Israel like in a

3897.49 --> 3901.35
like a liberal woman

3912.14 --> 3917.0
yeah I like Owen Benjamin stuff as well

3919.68 --> 3922.87
[Music]

3934.44 --> 3939.42
oh mercury seven but would you see the

3938.01 --> 3944.13
reflection of yourself

3996.04 --> 3999.24
really I can do about it

4043.93 --> 4052.5

4048.819 --> 4056.799
need to tweak the whole OBS setup now

4052.5 --> 4059.079

4056.799 --> 4061.42
of hangouts because hangouts broke it's

4059.079 --> 4063.7000000000003
broken and it's not my fault

don't know why it keeps on breaking with

4063.7 --> 4070.6189999999997

upgrades in the kitchen especially and

4188.26 --> 4195.820000000001
often would be nice you know just a real

4192.55 --> 4198.31
basic one but just the option like hey I

4195.82 --> 4205.0

justice warrior crap bleaching through

4224.68 --> 4227.22
that [ __ ]

4232.22 --> 4237.2
God seriously now that I'm thinking

4235.52 --> 4239.63
about it maybe they shouldn't do that

4237.2 --> 4242.45
like keep your hands of it because

4239.63 --> 4245.6900000000005
they're gonna just make it absolutely

4242.45 --> 4247.639999999999
atrocious ly disgusting I know they will

4245.69 --> 4249.349999999999
do it if they're gonna do it if

4247.64 --> 4258.62
Hollywood's gonna do that right now it's

4249.35 --> 4260.96
gonna be disgusting I just know it yeah

4258.62 --> 4263.98

money although it done really has I need

4280.599 --> 4286.51

4283.959 --> 4290.88
that if they're gonna do a dune reboot

4286.51 --> 4296.829000000001

4300.84 --> 4308.499
they just have to they can't not do it

4304.929 --> 4311.709
that's why I say just know Hollywood you

4308.499 --> 4315.4
just stay away from the good movies we

4311.709 --> 4318.34
don't need you to redo [ __ ] in your own

4315.4 --> 4322.079
social justice warriors insanity image

4318.34 --> 4322.079
okay we don't need it

4344.23 --> 4347.5199999999995
are you talking about

4357.01 --> 4361.77
huh

4359.369 --> 4365.3099999999995
five euros okay that's basically it

4361.77 --> 4367.17
taking off the hands price it's more to

4365.31 --> 4370.79
make it official it's like giving it

4367.17 --> 4370.79
away that's crazy

4380.03 --> 4387.41
but I don't know there's a lot of

4383.3 --> 4392.56
secondhand oven microwave combi things

4387.41 --> 4392.5599999999995
being sold out there just loads of them

4392.98 --> 4396.98
but still yes it's a bit of an

4395.42 --> 4398.72
investment and you also have to

4396.98 --> 4401.45
transport the damn things and that's

4398.72 --> 4403.55
usually the problem it's not something

4401.45 --> 4405.86
that's gonna be easily transported on

4403.55 --> 4415.63
the back of my bike if you know what I

4405.86 --> 4418.28
mean I'm gonna have to ask one of my

4415.63 --> 4421.7
roommates for assistance

4418.28 --> 4429.32
they actually have cars like the freak

4421.7 --> 4432.19

4429.32 --> 4432.19
the [ __ ] going on

4448.12 --> 4454.7699999999995
alright all this talks about ovens is

4450.82 --> 4454.7699999999995
making me hungry for pizza now

4487.59 --> 4497.7300000000005
are they really voyage I don't know I

4490.829 --> 4502.17
don't know I wouldn't know but don't

4497.73 --> 4508.079
underestimate the whole taxes on cars

4502.17 --> 4511.4400000000005
that's like terrible taxes the taxation

4508.079 --> 4514.949
on cars and on fuel in general is what

4511.44 --> 4516.928999999999
MIT forced me to pretty much do my still

4514.949 --> 4527.28
perfectly functioning car away

4516.929 --> 4529.039
I still miss it it was really good and

4527.28 --> 4532.17
it always worked

4529.039 --> 4537.0
yeah pieces fell off it but it always

4532.17 --> 4542.4
worked it always kept on running I know

4537.0 --> 4548.46
well I'm bike bound bicycle bound right

4542.4 --> 4550.409
now and as long as I have my driver's

4548.46 --> 4553.619
license I can always like rent a car or

4550.409 --> 4558.719
whatever for a day or however long I

4553.619 --> 4560.969
need it and it's not that expensive

4558.719 --> 4567.449
either so and you don't have to pay

4560.969 --> 4569.13
freaking taxes and [ __ ] hmm now look

4567.449 --> 4571.949
that one guy that's the funny thing

4569.13 --> 4575.76
about pizza and ovens especially like

4571.949 --> 4578.19
the typical come combi ovens is they

4575.76 --> 4582.599
don't get burned it cuz when the time

4578.19 --> 4585.869
runs out the often goes off so it

4582.599 --> 4588.900000000001
doesn't burn may get cold if you forget

4585.869 --> 4590.61
about it but it's not gonna burn up it's

4588.9 --> 4593.299999999999
another advantage you can just put a

4590.61 --> 4596.848999999999
pizza in an oven and then walk away

4593.3 --> 4599.969
unless it's not a timer based often yeah

4596.849 --> 4602.539
then you gotta pay attention or you know

4599.969 --> 4602.539
what happens

4602.85 --> 4606.039000000001
[Music]

4609.23 --> 4613.74
yeah you know what I'm wait it's Sunday

4612.24 --> 4616.67
isn't it Christ

4613.74 --> 4619.05
yeah then things are gonna be closed

4616.67 --> 4623.96
talking about clothes for some reason

4619.05 --> 4627.6
there is no church today no idea why

4623.96 --> 4630.74
just yeah gates still closed nobody

4627.6 --> 4630.740000000001
showed up I don't know why

4638.14 --> 4647.7300000000005
and I don't go there anymore right I

4640.96 --> 4647.7300000000005
still keep track all right

4661.449 --> 4671.259999999999
the God needed the day off that's

4663.669 --> 4673.659
hilarious I don't think God really needs

4671.26 --> 4679.769
a day off he literally has all the time

4673.659 --> 4679.768999999999
in the world literally it's his

4680.19 --> 4683.32
[Music]

4688.7 --> 4695.51
[Music]

4701.6 --> 4704.639
[Music]

4716.83 --> 4725.87
Parrish Mike I like that one is it

4722.9 --> 4728.75
possible that NASA caught a space giant

4725.87 --> 4732.05
on camera ancient astronaut theorists

4728.75 --> 4735.699
say yes that's so funny you know space

4732.05 --> 4738.5
giant what the moment you said that

4735.699 --> 4744.949
there's one particular thing I have to

4738.5 --> 4748.34
think about right away and that is the

4744.949 --> 4752.739
Robo tech space series which is the

4748.34 --> 4757.07
Americanization of I forget the original

4752.739 --> 4758.949
it's a Gundam style series very old I

4757.07 --> 4763.759999999999
don't remember the original and so

4758.949 --> 4768.469
that's so unmanned go of me but yeah

4763.76 --> 4771.679
that series spaceships like space jets

4768.469 --> 4773.92
that could transform into robots it was

4771.679 --> 4776.78
so freaking awesome it was so epic and

4773.92 --> 4780.469
when seeing it back the dialogue was

4776.78 --> 4783.62
absolutely [ __ ] beyond recognition

4780.469 --> 4785.9890000000005
but the visuals and just what happened

4783.62 --> 4788.3
in the story was so impressive and they

4785.989 --> 4790.759999999999
had frickin space giants in there okay

4788.3 --> 4794.659000000001
that was so amazing so they were like

4790.76 --> 4796.4890000000005
these these Jets humans in them that

4794.659 --> 4798.949
we're doing fighting and shooting with

4796.489 --> 4803.169999999999
giant guns and space battles and then

4798.949 --> 4808.61
there were space giants that were like

4803.17 --> 4811.88
almost astronaut moon lander like

4808.61 --> 4816.71
sitting like giants sitting in these big

4811.88 --> 4819.650000000001
pods pretty cramped up and then doing

4816.71 --> 4822.08
space battle so yeah they were fighting

4819.65 --> 4825.17
space giants that actually happened in

4822.08 --> 4827.9
that series in the 90s so it's funny

4825.17 --> 4830.78
that you mentioned ancient astronaut

4827.9 --> 4835.8099999999995
theory is about space giants well that's

4830.78 --> 4838.82
exactly what it makes me think of and

4835.81 --> 4842.39
yeah michael roark in this case that one

4838.82 --> 4846.28
particular video has have people

4842.39 --> 4849.38
behind a model it's only a model

4846.28 --> 4853.67
yeah Voynich Titans I think they were

4849.38 --> 4855.29
considered Titans but I thought that was

4853.67 --> 4858.02
just awesome

4855.29 --> 4859.4
how awesome is it to have macros that's

4858.02 --> 4862.370000000001
there that's right that's the one that's

4859.4 --> 4865.94
the original series that that was based

4862.37 --> 4867.92
on Robo tech well I got to see the

4865.94 --> 4871.04
Saturday morning cartoons as Robo tech

4867.92 --> 4873.2300000000005
and I got up at 7 o'clock every single

4871.04 --> 4877.91
Saturday just to see a glimpse of that

4873.23 --> 4880.58
my god what a series so amazing so

4877.91 --> 4882.61
hardcore pretty much was very brutal at

4880.58 --> 4882.61
times

4883.93 --> 4894.17
yeah Robo tech was 80s yeah I make it

4890.75 --> 4897.34
mix it up sometimes 80s and 90s it was

4894.17 --> 4902.42
80s yeah I saw it when it was just like

4897.34 --> 4913.46
8/10 way too young actually but it was

4902.42 --> 4917.21
so amazing space Giants God Thunderbirds

4913.46 --> 4920.96
no no I wouldn't get up early to see

4917.21 --> 4924.38
that that Siri it was kind of fun but it

4920.96 --> 4926.96
was so slow nothing really happened a

4924.38 --> 4932.2
lot in there it was something you could

4926.96 --> 4936.28
watch with your parents you know yeah no

4932.2 --> 4939.349999999999
no seriously but things like Robo tech

4936.28 --> 4941.179999999999
my parents did get to see like a glimpse

4939.35 --> 4942.92
of that and they were like freaked out

4941.18 --> 4949.79
about it because they thought it was

4942.92 --> 4954.83
just it was it was anime in that time

4949.79 --> 4957.14
pretty heavy and very motion II and like

4954.83 --> 4960.14
the big eyes it wasn't that bad but

4957.14 --> 4961.97
still was there and they just didn't

4960.14 --> 4964.2390000000005
like it and were like ah this is too

4961.97 --> 4966.650000000001
weird

4964.239 --> 4968.889999999999
but I thought it was just freaking

4966.65 --> 4968.889999999999
amazing

4972.77 --> 4981.059
no fault John oh yeah the old fault rom

4978.179 --> 4985.889
had his charm there's a new Voltron

4981.059 --> 4992.04
series though on on Netflix and it is

4985.889 --> 5001.3
horrendous horrendous it's so [ __ ]

4992.04 --> 5001.3
and it's so prefabricated [ __ ] II I

5001.78 --> 5007.19
can't believe I actually managed to

5003.98 --> 5009.759999999999
watch that for like 20 minutes before I

5007.19 --> 5012.829
just clicked it away forever

5009.76 --> 5013.9400000000005
God that is stupid but yeah the old one

5012.829 --> 5017.259999999999
that was pretty cool

5013.94 --> 5019.579
it was basic kind of basic again

5017.26 --> 5021.619000000001
conversations were kind of [ __ ] but

5019.579 --> 5025.579
most conversations and cartoons back

5021.619 --> 5029.57
then were kind of [ __ ] but still it

5025.579 --> 5032.239
was fresh it was new it was the people

5029.57 --> 5034.159
making it were really inspired to do it

5032.239 --> 5037.579
that's the big difference with now

5034.159 --> 5040.219
everything is now all prefab CGI [ __ ]

5037.579 --> 5042.71
quickly and people just wanna make money

5040.219 --> 5049.67
and they're not really inspired anymore

5042.71 --> 5051.2300000000005
I get the feeling this it's just like

5049.67 --> 5053.96
computer games you know when computer

5051.23 --> 5057.5
games really came out first the makers

5053.96 --> 5060.579
were just they were artists and they

5057.5 --> 5063.32
were really trying to make a sub realm

5060.579 --> 5066.049999999999
experience really putting everything

5063.32 --> 5067.759999999999
into it and figuring new things out out

5066.05 --> 5069.7390000000005
of nothing things that were seemingly

5067.76 --> 5072.77
impossible they would do in the game

5069.739 --> 5074.509999999999
even though the technical technically it

5072.77 --> 5077.4490000000005
shouldn't be possible that kind of stuff

5074.51 --> 5080.030000000001
was very inspiring and games were very

5077.449 --> 5083.409
interesting back then now everything is

5080.03 --> 5087.92
possible and everything is totally

5083.409 --> 5090.92
corporatized and just copy-paste same

5087.92 --> 5094.719
[ __ ] every single time and it's getting

5090.92 --> 5094.719
old it's getting old fast

5095.219 --> 5102.869
just the glory and the novelty runs out

5099.03 --> 5110.369
really quickly now with new games it

5102.869 --> 5113.28
does it's kind of sad yeah it's because

5110.369 --> 5115.619
it's all carpet eyes it's just when

5113.28 --> 5119.938999999999
money is the only real motivation that's

5115.619 --> 5122.549999999999
left then yeah that's gonna reflect upon

5119.939 --> 5126.689
the product it's gonna reflect upon the

5122.55 --> 5128.88
art you're gonna feel a lot of people

5126.689 --> 5130.769
being really bored being really good at

5128.88 --> 5133.889
what they do but being really uninspired

5130.769 --> 5136.349
at bored and you're gonna see how

5133.889 --> 5139.11
they're trying to goad you how they're

5136.349 --> 5142.019
trying to railroad you in some kind of

5139.11 --> 5146.659
specific pattern that is widely known

5142.019 --> 5146.659000000001
and trusted so it can go wrong

5178.329 --> 5182.429
hmm what is that

5182.44 --> 5187.199
Travis sent me with video

5191.869 --> 5196.08
what

5193.89 --> 5205.04
it's a bunch of ducks swimming on the

5196.08 --> 5205.04
horizon that's cool there on the horizon

5219.45 --> 5230.76
all right yeah good question it's a walk

5223.69 --> 5230.759999999999
on how long will EFI discussions go on

5237.3 --> 5244.1900000000005
well technically they can go on for a

5240.0 --> 5254.37
very very very very long time and

5244.19 --> 5257.16
without any action really but yeah it

5254.37 --> 5261.09
all depends if they're ready for it if

5257.16 --> 5263.42
they're ready to open it up and we'll

5261.09 --> 5263.42
see

5308.4 --> 5316.0199999999995
logos and demos I don't know what you

5312.06 --> 5318.950000000001
mean with demos that like supposedly the

5316.02 --> 5318.950000000001
opposite along us

5327.159 --> 5344.688999999999
yeah yeah Lagos logos Solon look it's a

5340.669 --> 5347.09
concept and what matters is what it

5344.689 --> 5354.679
means not how you spell it

5347.09 --> 5358.459
I like the logos because because it kind

5354.679 --> 5360.829
of fits with my pattern ISM concept it's

5358.459 --> 5362.84
a pattern it's the structure of how

5360.829 --> 5365.148999999999
things were designed it's the natural

5362.84 --> 5369.9490000000005
inherent structure of how things are

5365.149 --> 5373.939
designed and logos emphasizes the

5369.949 --> 5376.848999999999
blueprint a logo and the logo is

5373.939 --> 5382.329000000001
basically a print it's a pattern a

5376.849 --> 5382.329
visual related pattern based on visuals

5382.659 --> 5392.929
yeah to show like what is the ideal form

5389.349 --> 5396.32
what is the ideal pattern to follow for

5392.929 --> 5399.229
an individual what is logos what is the

5396.32 --> 5401.449
right way and so I like the

5399.229 --> 5405.829000000001
pronounciation logos a lot better and

5401.449 --> 5407.989
Legos just reminds me of Legos logos I

5405.829 --> 5410.38
think there's a low pass pronunciation

5407.989 --> 5410.379999999999
for it

5418.479 --> 5425.860000000001
but it's funny that that came along that

5421.809 --> 5427.179
that spun up as a talking point I picked

5425.86 --> 5431.469
it up through our and Benjamin is

5427.179 --> 5434.53
talking about it a lot but yeah it

5431.469 --> 5437.139
reminds me directly about about my

5434.53 --> 5441.4
pattern concept the structure of all

5437.139 --> 5445.9890000000005
reality the the pattern the design of

5441.4 --> 5449.558999999999
the creator and by which all things

5445.989 --> 5459.808999999999
manifest through our time in a certain

5449.559 --> 5459.809
pattern guys bickering on about

5469.27 --> 5472.359
[Music]

5525.779 --> 5530.629000000001
Wow Jesus

5532.489 --> 5535.57
I'm looking

5536.03 --> 5547.29
at Jose's livestream right now on that

5539.61 --> 5548.58
panel is it's all Globus and slick James

5547.29 --> 5553.23
is in there I don't know what the hell

5548.58 --> 5556.95
he is don't think it really matters but

5553.23 --> 5560.15
it's good it's like the worst group of

5556.95 --> 5562.86
people how stuffed in one this is just

5560.15 --> 5566.9
so yeah maybe somewhat amusing to

5562.86 --> 5566.9
somebody holy [ __ ]

5577.79 --> 5580.93
[Music]

5601.109 --> 5604.01
but anyway

5612.55 --> 5616.83
[Music]

5613.83 --> 5616.83
hmm

5624.019 --> 5631.09
anyway yeah I'm gonna round out the show

5628.369 --> 5633.889
because it don't have much more subject

5631.09 --> 5637.01
already and I'm kind of ready to get out

5633.889 --> 5640.749
there and it absorb some of the sunlight

5637.01 --> 5643.4890000000005
maybe get a console something like that

5640.749 --> 5648.88
and check out if I can find a

5643.489 --> 5652.789
replacement pen that I still need mm-hmm

5648.88 --> 5655.789
so yeah thanks everyone for coming it

5652.789 --> 5661.61
was kind of fun it was good to have the

5655.789 --> 5663.44
guest um that I had and glass Shaw that

5661.61 --> 5666.018999999999
was cool

5663.44 --> 5667.669999999999
yeah anyone else wanted to come on yeah

5666.019 --> 5671.030000000001
you know what to do you don't always

5667.67 --> 5673.9400000000005
have to keep on the sidelines it would

5671.03 --> 5677.449
be good to have maybe a wider panel just

5673.94 --> 5680.178999999999
have a discussion I don't necessarily it

5677.449 --> 5682.909
I don't necessarily want just one-on-one

5680.179 --> 5685.849
conversations you know it's bound to

5682.909 --> 5687.92
happen somebody joins but the beggar

5685.849 --> 5690.71
better chemistry actually happened so

5687.92 --> 5696.92
far when there's more than one person
