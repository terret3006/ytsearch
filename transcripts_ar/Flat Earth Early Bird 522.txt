oh

101.47 --> 111.25
yes yeah I had to rearrange my volume

106.869 --> 111.25
because yesterday I

112.36 --> 117.079
had been

114.61 --> 119.78
4 had to fool around with it a little

117.079 --> 122.92999999999999
because of good servant but yeah it

119.78 --> 126.649
started a bit low anyway and OBS has

122.93 --> 129.25900000000001
updated and changed some things so this

126.649 --> 132.07
seems to be a good volume I have to make

129.259 --> 134.04899999999998
sure I don't get too loud

132.07 --> 137.06
hmm

134.049 --> 138.58
little bit lower

137.06 --> 144.53
[Music]

138.58 --> 146.36
right so this is probably the best okay

144.53 --> 148.37
anyway yeah the weather today is

146.36 --> 153.28
completely different but I already see I

148.37 --> 153.28
was wearing sweater it's very cold

153.46 --> 160.07000000000002
UV cold but it is a lot colder it's

156.26 --> 162.32
completely clouded and raining it now

160.07 --> 164.01999999999998
every now and then not hard raining but

162.32 --> 166.7
it is like constantly

164.02 --> 168.44
little splashes of water come down so

166.7 --> 170.04999999999998
everything is looking wet it's very

168.44 --> 174.01
moist

170.05 --> 174.01000000000002
it's completely different

175.99 --> 181.72
but yeah this way the plants get

178.64 --> 181.72
something to drink -

181.81 --> 186.19
so I don't mind

184.45 --> 188.58999999999997
right

186.19 --> 193.93

188.59 --> 193.93

219.28 --> 225.209
storms

221.16 --> 229.53
yeah but I guess we had that in March

225.209 --> 232.78
it's odd it's like it moved a month

229.53 --> 233.97
hello most of the weird storms and stuff

232.78 --> 236.069
and

233.97 --> 238.299
March

236.069 --> 241.39

238.299 --> 244.62
month is being like a typical spring

241.39 --> 248.60999999999999

okay

385.36 --> 391.87
like who who would he be I

388.74 --> 394.15000000000003
don't think I haven't blocked it's like

391.87 --> 398.28000000000003
all the people I have blocked I they all

394.15 --> 398.28
have recognizable names I

401.37 --> 407.74
don't see him in there but maybe you got

404.319 --> 409.71000000000004
him blog but if he was blocked by you he

407.74 --> 413.31
would still be able to get here in chat

409.71 --> 416.099
you just wouldn't see him

413.31 --> 419.169
yeah I know right then anyway

416.099 --> 421.289
let's move on I went to bed very early

419.169 --> 424.659
yesterday

421.289 --> 428.71
like two o'clock I'm very glad I did

424.659 --> 430.449
because I did need the rest I was know

428.71 --> 432.50899999999996
in the last two days I've been feeling

430.449 --> 436.08000000000004
like this

432.509 --> 439.379
physical burden building up

436.08 --> 439.37899999999996
it's like

439.56 --> 445.87
smoking I have as well of course for a

442.99 --> 447.909
long time I've been smoking less now

445.87 --> 450.129
because I don't know it's weird like

447.909 --> 451.779
this period it builds up every now and

450.129 --> 454.99
then then kind of starts to hurt a

451.779 --> 458.44
little and it's like yeah basically

454.99 --> 460.93
telling you like to do take it easy we

458.44 --> 462.99
need like a rest period so I thought

460.93 --> 465.759
okay well I have been struggling less

462.99 --> 467.55
did you trying to postpone it's still

465.759 --> 470.65000000000003
enjoying what I do and

467.55 --> 473.289
yeah lots of chicken soup yesterday and

470.65 --> 474.87
went to bed really early two o'clock had

473.289 --> 479.199
basically

474.87 --> 483.93
it's left for 10 hours and was good it

479.199 --> 487.629
felt like I was sick sleeping and

483.93 --> 490.36
yeah it feels a lot better today so it

487.629 --> 491.8
like it healed a little bit more it's

490.36 --> 495.55
funny how that works you know some

491.8 --> 499.029
people that are like into into Karuna

495.55 --> 501.759
they would be like oh my god I got it I

499.029 --> 504.159
just know myself it's been like that

501.759 --> 506.72900000000004
forever since I started smoking pretty

504.159 --> 506.729
much a

507.629 --> 512.94
doctor would probably

509.699 --> 515.1990000000001
give very easy

512.94 --> 517.979
expletive ly common that it works that

515.199 --> 523.12
way for people that smoke

517.979 --> 526.4490000000001
anyway I'm just it's at my bronchial

523.12 --> 528.88
there at that area it's always it's like

526.449 --> 531.9399999999999
in the whole range of my respiratory

528.88 --> 535.12
system that's been the spot that would

531.94 --> 537.4300000000001
get burden over time and then give off a

535.12 --> 539.47
sign like yeah dude if you keep on like

537.43 --> 541.6899999999999
hardcore smoking you're it's something's

539.47 --> 544.4490000000001
gonna burst or something so you got to

541.69 --> 547.9490000000001
take it easy I'm glad that I didn't know

544.449 --> 547.949
how to recognize it

550.35 --> 553.899
yeah I'm never gonna wear a mask

552.37 --> 558.88
especially when it's like that

553.899 --> 562.74
absolutely not but the thing is I it

558.88 --> 566.74
there's no coughing sometimes it's like

562.74 --> 570.399
slime gets in the way and then I just

566.74 --> 573.25
have to usually that's enough to just

570.399 --> 575.139
get it out of the way sometimes yeah I

573.25 --> 577.779
might accidentally coughed but then it's

575.139 --> 582.069
more a cough like I'm choking because

577.779 --> 585.88
there's no like it's not inflamed to

582.069 --> 587.949
make me cough it hasn't been and if it

585.88 --> 590.47
were I know how to suppress it very well

587.949 --> 593.92
like that only breaks through when I'm

590.47 --> 597.839
like really in a really bad sick like I

593.92 --> 603.209
was for example at end of December

597.839 --> 605.94
remember that's I then I was really sick

603.209 --> 609.699
but yeah if you felt it

605.94 --> 613.149
so yeah there's no danger for anyone

609.699 --> 615.16
like I don't cough in public sorry I do

613.149 --> 618.25
sneeze sometimes but that's also because

615.16 --> 620.98
of the period out because I have very

618.25 --> 624.069
slight hay fever it's just very slight

620.98 --> 625.7090000000001
and the healthier I have the last

624.069 --> 628.06
trouble I have with it

625.709 --> 630.579
now in this period it would have been

628.06 --> 633.55
nice to have maybe some quail egg powder

630.579 --> 634.8389999999999
or something but yeah I don't have it it

633.55 --> 636.819
would have been nice to try it out if

634.839 --> 639.269
that would completely get the sneezing

636.819 --> 639.269
out of the way

640.82 --> 644.99
post-nasal drip is

643.43 --> 647.7299999999999
anyway

644.99 --> 647.94
it's for me this is kind of normal you

647.73 --> 651.029
know

647.94 --> 651.0290000000001
[Music]

662.64 --> 668.399
so yeah I'll just really admit sometimes

665.31 --> 672.2689999999999
I turn off turn on mute and go to the

668.399 --> 675.51
side it's usually because I either have

672.269 --> 677.01
to sneeze out of nowhere or I got a

675.51 --> 680.36
really drippy nose and have to do

677.01 --> 685.85
something about it because I am

680.36 --> 689.1
I've always done this I believe that

685.85 --> 692.029
typical cold effects and all that cold

689.1 --> 696.3290000000001
situations it rubs off psychosomatically

692.029 --> 699.329
so I it out of the way I always have

696.329 --> 701.18
because I just realized like what that

699.329 --> 704.13
it can actually trigger other people

701.18 --> 706.1999999999999
psychosomatically it doesn't really

704.13 --> 708.6899999999999
matter by what they think they might be

706.2 --> 711.2090000000001
getting it just that tends to happen so

708.69 --> 714.23
I keep it out of the way thank God for

711.209 --> 714.2299999999999
the instant mute button

714.41 --> 718.98
it's like very handy that I have it that

717.06 --> 721.399
I don't have to like in the middle of

718.98 --> 724.32
like a tendency to sneeze like have to

721.399 --> 726.06
quickly go somewhere and click somewhere

724.32 --> 727.9490000000001
specific you know that would be

726.06 --> 732.529
extremely annoying it's just like Oh

727.949 --> 734.12
button bang very handy

732.529 --> 736.92
and

734.12 --> 739.67
also I've kind of like gotten gotten

736.92 --> 742.86
used to now how this mute button works

739.67 --> 745.11
like this mute button is a bit of [ __ ]

742.86 --> 748.5600000000001
you have to really like slap it

745.11 --> 751.0790000000001
sometimes like really it Ram that button

748.56 --> 753.079
because sometimes yeah it just seems to

751.079 --> 755.79
be a little bit numb

753.079 --> 758.79
but I got the force level that's

755.79 --> 761.0
required to get it right now and so I

758.79 --> 763.05
rarely

761.0 --> 765.54
accidentally keep my cell phone mute now

763.05 --> 767.519
anymore it's staying that low it's not

765.54 --> 772.279
growing worse it's not like completely

767.519 --> 772.279
dysfunctional please anyway

774.42 --> 783.18
okay Marco backs what just a watch dark

779.22 --> 784.98
side Phil I have no idea

783.18 --> 788.04
who that is

784.98 --> 792.0600000000001
snorts Bernal what

788.04 --> 795.0889999999999
you mean dr. Phil from the ballers I

792.06 --> 798.18
have no it oh

795.089 --> 801.1800000000001
you mean

798.18 --> 804.51
dr. Phil that the TV psychologist

801.18 --> 804.51
supposedly him

809.1 --> 813.72
yeah I haven't watched him in a long

812.709 --> 815.25
time

813.72 --> 817.9200000000001
like

815.25 --> 820.899
in the 90s I

817.92 --> 823.06
used to kind of watch him together with

820.899 --> 824.77
my mother because my mother appreciated

823.06 --> 826.27
it and I was literally looking and I

824.77 --> 828.76
wouldn't be laughing at it mostly

826.27 --> 831.279
because he just wields very dumb

828.76 --> 833.56
psychology the funny thing was though if

831.279 --> 835.5889999999999
you can overlook that over time you can

833.56 --> 838.51
still kind of appreciate it

835.589 --> 840.97
but the problem is there's also a lot of

838.51 --> 844.0889999999999
reinforcement of just bad things and

840.97 --> 846.4
programming and but yeah even comic

844.089 --> 848.1700000000001
tricks can be nice and they yeah on a

846.4 --> 850.18
white platform they spread easily to

848.17 --> 851.49
people the problem is programming does

850.18 --> 854.4899999999999
too

851.49 --> 854.49
so

855.42 --> 861.209
but there's very little sophisticated

858.61 --> 864.42
tricks really that it forwards

861.209 --> 868.3299999999999
because this is just not the platform

864.42 --> 871.18
that it is I also used to watch Jerry

868.33 --> 873.5500000000001
Springer a lot you know why because I

871.18 --> 877.9499999999999
was fascinated to figure out who these

873.55 --> 881.0699999999999
people were if they were acting and why

877.95 --> 883.839
so I would completely ignore the

881.07 --> 886.63
presupposed story of it just completely

883.839 --> 890.32
ignore it like almost put it on mute and

886.63 --> 892.209
just stare at these people like how are

890.32 --> 895.0
they experienced what are they doing is

892.209 --> 898.329
this an act do they know the people

895.0 --> 900.07
really is that relationship effect real

898.329 --> 902.5
and sometimes it would be real you know

900.07 --> 906.759
because Jerry Springer was like a total

902.5 --> 910.72
grappler poor enacts maked to draw in

906.759 --> 912.61
public but he was experimental and

910.72 --> 915.639
didn't get some nutty people in there

912.61 --> 918.9300000000001
that were kind of real so it was it was

915.639 --> 921.279
odd it was like

918.93 --> 924.329
well it's like a really interesting

921.279 --> 927.009
YouTube show but back in the day

924.329 --> 929.3789999999999
but it was a bad influence though

927.009 --> 933.25
because it did like poor make people

929.379 --> 937.29
into Cervantes sort of I guess he was

933.25 --> 940.569
very early with it with the concept

937.29 --> 942.79
but yeah I did find it interesting back

940.569 --> 943.74
then just to see you like who are these

942.79 --> 945.75
people

943.74 --> 951.149
hmm

945.75 --> 951.149
what are what James Mason

953.67 --> 959.7299999999999
are when he is your chat wodden and who

965.96 --> 971.9000000000001
I don't know I think I'd be well

969.17 --> 975.77
hopefully pleasantly surprised by now if

971.9 --> 977.54
a if I did have some kind of kid that

975.77 --> 980.99
was a kept secret for me I did have

977.54 --> 983.4699999999999
several girlfriends and I wasn't a

980.99 --> 986.47
condom guy

983.47 --> 986.47
so

990.68 --> 995.459
fortunately that also means that I

992.79 --> 997.5
probably had without really knowing

995.459 --> 999.3499999999999
because I didn't really want to know I

997.5 --> 1002.35
probably have some

999.35 --> 1002.35
abortions

1002.5 --> 1008.38
terrible realization now

1005.17 --> 1011.75
but I don't know

1008.38 --> 1016.13
it's like all the girlfriends that I was

1011.75 --> 1018.49
with they were worthy you know I guess I

1016.13 --> 1021.29
do pick out what I

1018.49 --> 1023.62
it's just my instinct for girlfriends

1021.29 --> 1027.53
I've always been

1023.62 --> 1029.48
like they they they have to mix it like

1027.53 --> 1033.6499999999999
there has to be a good crossover

1029.48 --> 1035.27
possible it did yeah even though in my

1033.65 --> 1037.27
mind I could have been kind of like Oh

1035.27 --> 1041.209
sex sex sex you know

1037.27 --> 1044.929
but my instinct would just force me to

1041.209 --> 1047.059
go to good procreation material like my

1044.929 --> 1051.25
mind would be preoccupied by stupid [ __ ]

1047.059 --> 1054.6789999999999
I know like sex basic stuff like ooh

1051.25 --> 1056.87
but my body would take it a lot more

1054.679 --> 1059.7800000000002
serious and basically like a silent

1056.87 --> 1062.9289999999999
parent kind of push me like no no no

1059.78 --> 1065.35
this one not that one that's that's kind

1062.929 --> 1068.3600000000001
of bad that's gonna be sucky

1065.35 --> 1069.76
it's funny how that works makes me very

1068.36 --> 1073.4599999999998
picky though

1069.76 --> 1075.35
but yeah with any of them I wouldn't

1073.46 --> 1077.9
have mine in retrospect having a kid

1075.35 --> 1079.58
it's just that I was absolutely unable

1077.9 --> 1082.22
to handle it and would be panicky and

1079.58 --> 1083.809
totally stupid and all that and but

1082.22 --> 1087.28
maybe then get over it you know in

1083.809 --> 1090.8899999999999
retrospect I don't know

1087.28 --> 1093.74
it's just that I have kids in mind a lot

1090.89 --> 1096.38
these days also thanks to own Benjamin

1093.74 --> 1098.659
you know showing off with this freaking

1096.38 --> 1101.21
glorious kids they are so awesome it's

1098.659 --> 1106.8700000000001
it's like really making me jealous you

1101.21 --> 1110.21
know and some they remind me a lot about

1106.87 --> 1114.049
personal like I see a lot of myself in

1110.21 --> 1117.32
them but it's not right but genuinely

1114.049 --> 1119.11
like certain types of stances states of

1117.32 --> 1122.3899999999999
minds I recognize them

1119.11 --> 1124.61
I'm 100% your own Benjamin of course has

1122.39 --> 1127.0400000000002
died with his own kid as well and

1124.61 --> 1130.9699999999998
yeah I

1127.04 --> 1134.84
don't know you know I'm 40

1130.97 --> 1136.82
I should be doing this kind of stuff

1134.84 --> 1139.82
thinking about that

1136.82 --> 1139.82
hmm

1140.06 --> 1143.3899999999999
right so

1150.76 --> 1155.23
yeah

1152.04 --> 1157.6499999999999
well my advice with kids is just take it

1155.23 --> 1160.77
extremely serious and realized that

1157.65 --> 1163.3600000000001
probably gonna be powerless a lot

1160.77 --> 1165.6
because that's exactly what it was with

1163.36 --> 1170.1999999999998
my parents towards me

1165.6 --> 1173.62
like I required so much attention but it

1170.2 --> 1176.5
is because I was trying to build this

1173.62 --> 1179.2299999999998
this skill this state of being it

1176.5 --> 1181.87
requires a lot of work it requires a lot

1179.23 --> 1185.59
of tutoring like I was trying to be a

1181.87 --> 1189.9699999999998
wizard a good one just like no I have to

1185.59 --> 1192.0
I have to become like ultra smart ultra

1189.97 --> 1195.549
wise beyond everyone

1192.0 --> 1198.73
day yeah though as a kid that's just

1195.549 --> 1201.04
what I wanted but at the same time I had

1198.73 --> 1202.99
a lot of ego issues of course to balance

1201.04 --> 1205.8999999999999
that out and they were very punishing

1202.99 --> 1208.299
and it grew also into like this

1205.9 --> 1210.27
self-loathing thing because it was

1208.299 --> 1213.91
always my ego that would get in the way

1210.27 --> 1216.58
when it didn't I would make amazing

1213.91 --> 1219.64
progress like amazing I would be

1216.58 --> 1221.71
astonished by what I could do but when

1219.64 --> 1224.88
it didn't an ego got in the way then it

1221.71 --> 1229.15
would be like oh my god why

1224.88 --> 1230.7900000000002
yeah and I guess that's still kind of in

1229.15 --> 1234.8200000000002
me a little

1230.79 --> 1236.6689999999999
but learn to deal with my ego a lot

1234.82 --> 1239.49
better now

1236.669 --> 1242.6100000000001
but yeah if I'm gonna have a kid I'm

1239.49 --> 1244.44
certain they're gonna have similar

1242.61 --> 1246.9699999999998
issues

1244.44 --> 1250.8400000000001
and they're gonna have a lot of trouble

1246.97 --> 1253.38
facing the world like emotionally a lot

1250.84 --> 1259.7099999999998
of trouble it's going to be extremely

1253.38 --> 1259.71
dangerous as it was with me

1261.34 --> 1267.9399999999998
that Tom Parker married an Italian girl

1264.47 --> 1267.94
you would have good-looking kids

1268.12 --> 1274.6
maybe I don't know it depends my brother

1271.82 --> 1274.6
did

1277.06 --> 1280.27
my way

1282.39 --> 1285.8300000000002
very smart go

1286.72 --> 1291.31
yeah I don't know exactly how but she is

1290.39 --> 1294.5300000000002
like a

1291.31 --> 1298.22
biologist labyrinth I hope it's not

1294.53 --> 1300.02
something bad I have no idea I don't you

1298.22 --> 1302.93
know I you know the next time I would

1300.02 --> 1305.78
probably inquire about it if I ever go

1302.93 --> 1307.8400000000001
to visit there again which is extremely

1305.78 --> 1311.06
rare but I

1307.84 --> 1315.34
feel drawn also to go to my brother

1311.06 --> 1318.02
again at some point you know I am I

1315.34 --> 1320.36
because what really got in the way of

1318.02 --> 1322.7
that and I'm gonna like spill my guts

1320.36 --> 1326.1499999999999
all over the place right it's that I'm

1322.7 --> 1329.77
pretty ashamed of myself that I have not

1326.15 --> 1332.3300000000002
really yeah about that part of never

1329.77 --> 1334.7
being really good at building a career

1332.33 --> 1336.9499999999998
and now I have this kind of you know it

1334.7 --> 1338.8600000000001
is there if this is going on it is

1336.95 --> 1342.02
happening so I

1338.86 --> 1344.33
feel like yeah I can finally present

1342.02 --> 1346.27
myself like yeah I am a media guy now

1344.33 --> 1348.47
it's yeah

1346.27 --> 1351.92
kind of didn't expect it but at least

1348.47 --> 1354.68
it's something and I am building and I

1351.92 --> 1356.96
am making income and yeah I hope to get

1354.68 --> 1358.5800000000002
better at it maybe that'll give him a

1356.96 --> 1360.41
little bit more respect because that

1358.58 --> 1363.11
always weighed very heavily in the

1360.41 --> 1365.8700000000001
family and he took that and he was

1363.11 --> 1368.9599999999998
always kind of ashamed that I kind of a

1365.87 --> 1372.79
reject him and I didn't know how to

1368.96 --> 1372.79
handle that right

1374.149 --> 1380.4189999999999
but in yeah I've retrospect the last few

1376.639 --> 1385.2489999999998
times it he knows that and he like tries

1380.419 --> 1387.979
not not to make me feel a shame but the

1385.249 --> 1392.179
problem is is that I it comes from me

1387.979 --> 1394.849
really like no I am sure like I do want

1392.179 --> 1399.3390000000002
to be like oh brother look I made it you

1394.849 --> 1402.739
know I I'm a man now it took me

1399.339 --> 1406.989
incredibly long but I am that's really

1402.739 --> 1406.989
the deep inner feeling about it I

1409.719 --> 1413.6490000000001
have to do this for myself

1414.129 --> 1420.1689999999999
cope with disappointment yeah dude I am

1417.789 --> 1422.539
that's why I'm kind of sharing this

1420.169 --> 1426.1390000000001
don't worry about it I'm being very

1422.539 --> 1429.039
honest but these are not out-of-control

1426.139 --> 1429.039
feelings I

1429.879 --> 1434.529
just know that it works that way

1437.82 --> 1442.72
[Music]

1439.51 --> 1445.78
but I appreciate it

1442.72 --> 1449.73
what's that

1445.78 --> 1449.73
[Music]

1454.48 --> 1457.59
ah [ __ ]

1460.26 --> 1464.7
dude

1462.3 --> 1467.11
why does somebody want to know that

1464.7 --> 1470.2
about me that is creepy

1467.11 --> 1470.1999999999998
[Music]

1480.08 --> 1482.799
all right

1487.74 --> 1494.46
it is sneaky though because I am almost

1491.29 --> 1498.1499999999999
like a compulsive question at answerer

1494.46 --> 1501.19
but I think that I

1498.15 --> 1503.2800000000002
don't know about that you know I don't

1501.19 --> 1506.41
know how it really works with girls

1503.28 --> 1508.3899999999999
versus men all that I know is that all

1506.41 --> 1510.8100000000002
my girlfriend's all seem to have this

1508.39 --> 1513.72
amazing skill that

1510.81 --> 1518.28
like they could hold it up like forever

1513.72 --> 1518.28
but they would get very complaining

1519.81 --> 1527.29
so it would always be like okay we're

1523.54 --> 1528.96
like going somewhere always have in mind

1527.29 --> 1532.83
where there are toilets

1528.96 --> 1536.68
but for me not so much

1532.83 --> 1539.1299999999999
but yeah you know it I live in a house

1536.68 --> 1541.6000000000001
with like multiple people

1539.13 --> 1544.69

1541.6 --> 1545.9699999999998

really hurting then yeah of course I

1558.04 --> 1562.3
will do that and then I will thoroughly

1560.26 --> 1563.74
clean it up maybe even throw some bleach

1562.3 --> 1568.09
after it because I don't want anything

1563.74 --> 1571.09
to stink you know or I'll do it in the

1568.09 --> 1575.4599999999998
shower or whatever but yeah I am NOT

1571.09 --> 1575.4599999999998
gonna piss my pants thank you very much

1579.68 --> 1585.63
sorry I I couldn't help but I had to

1582.6 --> 1586.6999999999998
answer that stupid question pee in a cup

1585.63 --> 1588.47
what

1586.7 --> 1591.5
that is

1588.47 --> 1591.5
no I

1592.91 --> 1595.91
what

1596.66 --> 1602.45
yeah yeah Robin Stanley it's I I took

1600.87 --> 1605.31
the baton sorry

1602.45 --> 1607.95
stupid questions I shouldn't have I

1605.31 --> 1611.61
should have just gone with that it was

1607.95 --> 1614.71
timed out I don't know why but I just

1611.61 --> 1614.7099999999998
[Music]

1614.9 --> 1619.0400000000002
well really unicorn Slayer

1635.34 --> 1638.48
yeah I don't know

1640.44 --> 1646.5
I technically have never tested for like

1643.53 --> 1648.92
fertility it is on my mind a lot but I

1646.5 --> 1651.38
get reinsured through spiritual

1648.92 --> 1654.6000000000001
sequences that

1651.38 --> 1656.8400000000001
that it's alright that I don't have to

1654.6 --> 1656.84
worry

1660.29 --> 1666.05
low Mindwarp

1663.02 --> 1669.18
count is too low okay

1666.05 --> 1671.54
I'll take that for whatever is worth you

1669.18 --> 1671.54
know I

1672.62 --> 1677.6699999999998
think that

1674.78 --> 1679.74
part and this is my personal conviction

1677.67 --> 1682.3500000000001
that I don't have any direct proof or

1679.74 --> 1685.38
it's a spiritual thing but I think that

1682.35 --> 1687.2099999999998
if there is like a momentum you find the

1685.38 --> 1690.75
right person and it's the right time

1687.21 --> 1693.47
that God basically pulls you in with all

1690.75 --> 1697.02
this energy to just make it happen and

1693.47 --> 1699.05
whatever the count is or maybe you're

1697.02 --> 1703.11
completely in stare out

1699.05 --> 1706.4099999999999
stare out for some reason as by doctor

1703.11 --> 1708.6799999999998
or whatever test that if it is meant to

1706.41 --> 1710.8200000000002
be it'll happen

1708.68 --> 1712.74
but I don't know maybe that's just

1710.82 --> 1714.56
magical thinking or magical hoping I

1712.74 --> 1718.23
don't know I

1714.56 --> 1720.5
know Robin Stan Stanley 40 is not too

1718.23 --> 1723.44
old to start a family I know

1720.5 --> 1727.2
especially for a man

1723.44 --> 1730.3400000000001
look I've when I was with my ex we knew

1727.2 --> 1730.3400000000001
some people and

1730.4 --> 1738.89
yeah a very good guy he will he was like

1733.73 --> 1742.97
48 and his father it's like

1738.89 --> 1745.0400000000002
30 years older than his mother

1742.97 --> 1748.79
and

1745.04 --> 1754.01
he was like 50 or something

1748.79 --> 1754.01
so yeah when it works it works

1758.39 --> 1763.5800000000002
for men they can say if they could take

1761.45 --> 1766.8400000000001
good care of themselves they can be

1763.58 --> 1766.84
fertile very long

1768.67 --> 1774.8200000000002
for women however it's different yeah

1771.74 --> 1777.94
they they don't have that much much time

1774.82 --> 1777.9399999999998
you know

1782.59 --> 1788.48
unless I don't know they

1785.17 --> 1792.73
freeze an egg or something so I don't

1788.48 --> 1792.73
even know if that is a really viable I

1793.45 --> 1801.5900000000001
have no insight on how that works but

1799.01 --> 1802.6299999999999
yeah that's always gonna cost so it's

1801.59 --> 1805.6399999999999
not

1802.63 --> 1808.0900000000001
it's only gonna be for the rich that

1805.64 --> 1808.0900000000001
kind of thing

1809.59 --> 1817.9299999999998
yeah a lot of men do put children off

1812.23 --> 1817.93
it's it's such it's so stupid

1819.94 --> 1825.3200000000002
because you can always find a balance

1822.62 --> 1826.87
and it's amazing what kids can actually

1825.32 --> 1829.96
provide

1826.87 --> 1832.76
energy wise and just

1829.96 --> 1834.8
kids if you're good if you're if

1832.76 --> 1837.35
everything is good they get they make

1834.8 --> 1841.58
themselves eventually concerned about

1837.35 --> 1843.98
the welfare of their parents if yeah if

1841.58 --> 1845.11
they're not to trouble about personal

1843.98 --> 1846.98
things

1845.11 --> 1850.37
especially when they're much younger and

1846.98 --> 1852.28
then they can really give you the right

1850.37 --> 1855.8899999999999
thing at the right moment when

1852.28 --> 1858.02
everything seems like ah workers go nuts

1855.89 --> 1862.19
or something it's amazing what little

1858.02 --> 1864.53
kids can do for you and and yeah people

1862.19 --> 1866.66
that don't have kids often overlook that

1864.53 --> 1870.6499999999999
they just think oh it's just gonna be a

1866.66 --> 1873.95
burden oh no I don't have kids and I

1870.65 --> 1876.46
know this I know that this it's big

1873.95 --> 1881.0800000000002
doesn't work like that I

1876.46 --> 1881.08
wish I did when I was younger

1881.929 --> 1886.8790000000001
I

1883.539 --> 1888.74
kind of didn't know but I still thought

1886.879 --> 1890.7199999999998
I couldn't handle it and I probably

1888.74 --> 1892.61
couldn't back then I did you know that's

1890.72 --> 1895.909
the complicated thing I think I can

1892.61 --> 1898.399
handle it now but even thinking back at

1895.909 --> 1902.74
how I was like twenty years ago I was

1898.399 --> 1906.9699999999998
too chaotic too wild and

1902.74 --> 1910.72
dangerous I would risk a lot of

1906.97 --> 1914.3500000000001
yeah moral stuff I was like really I'm

1910.72 --> 1917.24
pushing it on the edge you know

1914.35 --> 1920.539
like what teens do but I kind of kept on

1917.24 --> 1923.99
doing that I wasn't it was dangerous it

1920.539 --> 1927.549
was dangerous for me it was risky but

1923.99 --> 1927.549
just bravada

1928.659 --> 1937.1290000000001
and at the same time

1932.47 --> 1939.1290000000001
also very cowardice sometimes that my

1937.129 --> 1942.11
feelings would always haunt me

1939.129 --> 1944.4189999999999
one way or the other it's just too much

1942.11 --> 1946.58
feeling and then yeah what kind of

1944.419 --> 1949.999
example are you to kids when you're just

1946.58 --> 1952.07
like exploding all the time in feeling

1949.999 --> 1954.23
somehow or making being extremely

1952.07 --> 1956.1689999999999
concerned about things that you

1954.23 --> 1958.749
shouldn't really I

1956.169 --> 1962.8600000000001
think I could definitely

1958.749 --> 1962.8600000000001
prevent that from happening now

1976.45 --> 1979.2
all right

1980.53 --> 1988.47
well it's also amazing that just how

1984.01 --> 1988.47
absolutely brilliant kids can be

1990.54 --> 1998.52
like I'm always amazed to see when

1995.31 --> 2001.77
with really smart kids

1998.52 --> 2005.16
that when they're like in peace that

2001.77 --> 2008.75
they can just puzzle things together so

2005.16 --> 2011.66
rapidly kind of like I do

2008.75 --> 2014.49
when they're so incredibly young and

2011.66 --> 2017.0400000000002
haven't technically even touched upon

2014.49 --> 2020.88
the meaning of things really it just

2017.04 --> 2023.55
works this is we go it just manifests

2020.88 --> 2026.2800000000002
like that it's like God gave it to them

2023.55 --> 2028.76
just like that its inherent it's amazing

2026.28 --> 2028.76
how that works

2034.88 --> 2040.7600000000002
it's like they're

2037.36 --> 2043.25
grabbing insights outside of their reach

2040.76 --> 2045.89
almost because they just haven't been

2043.25 --> 2048.169
confronted and they just get it it's

2045.89 --> 2049.879
amazing how that way it baffles me every

2048.169 --> 2053.2
time and it baffles me with my own

2049.879 --> 2053.2
insight sometimes you know

2053.83 --> 2061.429
it's magic it's magic to me it's a magic

2057.169 --> 2065.8889999999997
of just of the human or all of you have

2061.429 --> 2065.889
the human spirit what what we are

2066.129 --> 2071.35
and the amazing potential

2069.639 --> 2076.3
and

2071.35 --> 2076.2999999999997
the dangers of Grabel everywhere

2083.45 --> 2090.5699999999997
gee hmm yeah well if you are really if

2088.41 --> 2093.27
you've set your mind you know on I'm

2090.57 --> 2095.21
gonna get a kid like I got a girlfriend

2093.27 --> 2098.07
or wife

2095.21 --> 2099.29
I'm gonna get that kid I'm gonna we're

2098.07 --> 2101.3
gonna do it

2099.29 --> 2104.94
get away from

2101.3 --> 2109.8
from heavy mobile phones get away from

2104.94 --> 2113.19
radio Radio logics get away from Wi-Fi

2109.8 --> 2115.59
and I don't mean that you know do you

2113.19 --> 2119.4
have to bat it all in a radius of a mile

2115.59 --> 2123.06
another just make sure you don't carry

2119.4 --> 2125.0
your mobile on you all day long I am

2123.06 --> 2128.7
serious

2125.0 --> 2131.63
just bring it along and give it a

2128.7 --> 2136.35
designated spot

2131.63 --> 2139.02
just a way like plenty away from your

2136.35 --> 2142.38
balls basically and if there's Wi-Fi

2139.02 --> 2146.46
somewhere or tower just try to stay away

2142.38 --> 2148.71
from that maybe I know maybe there's

2146.46 --> 2151.23
like this special radiologically

2148.71 --> 2154.07
isolating Underpants I think they

2151.23 --> 2154.07
actually exist

2154.22 --> 2157.8199999999997
it's worth it

2159.53 --> 2163.63
I would get one of those

2168.94 --> 2176.14
and yeah the same goes for for females

2172.63 --> 2178.54
of course like keep that [ __ ] away from

2176.14 --> 2182.3799999999997
your uterus this is official you know

2178.54 --> 2184.99
that and this has already been figured

2182.38 --> 2187.48
out in the last twenty years that like

2184.99 --> 2189.9399999999996
teens when they're developing and they

2187.48 --> 2192.6
have mobiles in their pockets right next

2189.94 --> 2197.07
to their uterus just doing stuff all day

2192.6 --> 2200.19
that there what is it it

2197.07 --> 2204.1200000000003
their eggs kind of freeze

2200.19 --> 2207.19
they they don't their cycle is

2204.12 --> 2209.71
interrupted I've heard about this I

2207.19 --> 2212.02
don't know exactly how it works but it

2209.71 --> 2215.25
especially for young females it's

2212.02 --> 2215.25
actually very dangerous

2220.32 --> 2227.07
right I haven't put out the exact detail

2224.19 --> 2229.62
but I know it's dangerous for females

2227.07 --> 2231.2400000000002
especially when they're young because it

2229.62 --> 2233.16
has an influence like on their uterus

2231.24 --> 2235.3999999999996
and their eggs or something that

2233.16 --> 2238.62
fallopian tubes

2235.4 --> 2241.8
look it up but that's beneficial that's

2238.62 --> 2245.0
official study and that's not even

2241.8 --> 2249.27
specific to 5g all right now that's even

2245.0 --> 2253.05
even with 3G and 4G just pretty basic

2249.27 --> 2256.25
mobile can do that even a mobile in the

2253.05 --> 2259.13
90s could do that

2256.25 --> 2262.1
okay

2259.13 --> 2265.29
so be careful with that you

2262.1 --> 2268.23
know technically you can have Wi-Fi you

2265.29 --> 2271.17
can have a mobile you're not instantly

2268.23 --> 2273.35
gonna die and I've always said this it's

2271.17 --> 2275.58
like yeah unless you good like it mega

2273.35 --> 2276.87
radiation you're like in a microwave

2275.58 --> 2281.73
effectively and you're constantly

2276.87 --> 2283.77
downloading 10 G's of info pumping

2281.73 --> 2285.9
through you constantly from multiple

2283.77 --> 2290.61
angles yeah that's gonna cook you that's

2285.9 --> 2293.3
gonna be bad but just using sparingly it

2290.61 --> 2297.84
won't damage you but

2293.3 --> 2300.63
if you are planning to procreate then

2297.84 --> 2303.63
just be careful with that it has more

2300.63 --> 2306.53
influence on that specifically and also

2303.63 --> 2308.9700000000003
be very careful with your teenage girls

2306.53 --> 2311.36
because it's very likely they're going

2308.97 --> 2313.6499999999996
to be totally socially addicted to

2311.36 --> 2316.2000000000003
social media on the remote because they

2313.65 --> 2319.32
all do that unfortunately but the

2316.2 --> 2320.91
problem is if they constantly highly

2319.32 --> 2323.67
hang on to that all day long and they

2320.91 --> 2327.92
sleep next to it constantly in or worse

2323.67 --> 2330.4700000000003
it's gonna affect their procreation

2327.92 --> 2333.53
ability over time

2330.47 --> 2335.7799999999997
be very careful with this

2333.53 --> 2338.88
make them aware

2335.78 --> 2340.01
when they're still very young the

2338.88 --> 2343.9100000000003
dangers

2340.01 --> 2343.9100000000003
that's what I would do anyway

2344.0 --> 2346.03
ah

2346.63 --> 2351.86
yeah this is

2349.27 --> 2352.69
this early bird Chow seems to be all

2351.86 --> 2356.44
about

2352.69 --> 2356.44
parenting and procreation

2357.13 --> 2363.02
about the the 40 year old a single guy

2361.13 --> 2367.0
without kids it's kind of weird but I

2363.02 --> 2367.0
guess this stuff is on my mind right now

2372.58 --> 2376.69
yeah you're welcome Missouri Bear

2376.84 --> 2379.889
[Music]

2383.86 --> 2388.52
[Music]

2385.93 --> 2389.81
yeah it's not it's just it feels a

2388.52 --> 2392.68
little weird you know it's like because

2389.81 --> 2394.64
I I don't I'm giving advice

2392.68 --> 2396.8799999999997
even though I don't have first-hand

2394.64 --> 2396.8799999999997
experience

2401.38 --> 2406.2400000000002
but I guess I'm just very into this

2403.91 --> 2406.24
right now

2416.95 --> 2424.269
say something uplifting I just got to

2420.619 --> 2424.2690000000002
work all right

2424.63 --> 2431.42
well something uplifting but it is

2429.589 --> 2433.94
raining in Utrecht isn't that is

2431.42 --> 2436.309
uplifting well I'd look it's very the

2433.94 --> 2438.2000000000003
plants are very happy you know if it

2436.309 --> 2439.96
wouldn't happen then things wouldn't

2438.2 --> 2441.8799999999997
stay as nice and green

2439.96 --> 2444.589
so yeah

2441.88 --> 2448.339
rain is something to be happy about it

2444.589 --> 2451.16
gets annoying when it keeps on raining

2448.339 --> 2452.749
very hard for like a week then it gets

2451.16 --> 2456.519
really annoying but that's not the case

2452.749 --> 2456.519
so I'm actually kind of happy about this

2459.729 --> 2467.229
Wow Tom Parker that's

2463.69 --> 2473.9790000000003
hmm thank you I

2467.229 --> 2473.979
I hope I hope it's the time in a way I

2476.079 --> 2480.9500000000003
know I

2478.029 --> 2483.41
could bear it I've been looking out for

2480.95 --> 2487.7189999999996
that technically my entire life it just

2483.41 --> 2487.719
didn't happen and it wasn't the time and

2489.219 --> 2498.2000000000003
in a way when I was extremely young like

2494.259 --> 2499.759
six I already got the I already said

2498.2 --> 2503.299
this early on is that I've happened to

2499.759 --> 2505.88
my first like impulses of sexuality by

2503.299 --> 2508.7
my own you know nobody confronted me

2505.88 --> 2512.089
with that [ __ ] it's just that I had like

2508.7 --> 2514.7889999999998
this mmm I want to be with a girl and

2512.089 --> 2516.469
just feel I didn't even know what sex

2514.789 --> 2518.719
was really but it just that already

2516.469 --> 2521.089
happened and I already had this feel

2518.719 --> 2522.549
like I want to I want a family I want to

2521.089 --> 2526.029
crush it like

2522.549 --> 2529.009
when I was freaking 10

2526.029 --> 2531.559
and then there was nothing in the world

2529.009 --> 2535.359
really through to help me with that for

2531.559 --> 2535.3590000000004
real everybody just thought I was this

2535.69 --> 2539.319
passionate little kid

2547.72 --> 2553.81
but I have always had dreams of what my

2550.869 --> 2556.48
wife would be like and the way I've

2553.81 --> 2558.46
literal hat I've had literal visions and

2556.48 --> 2561.55
that makes it really creepy because I

2558.46 --> 2563.67
wonder sometimes like yeah you can't do

2561.55 --> 2566.6090000000004
that you can't just give me a single

2563.67 --> 2569.71
visual

2566.609 --> 2571.5099999999998
that can be real because then everybody

2569.71 --> 2572.43
I'm gonna meet is not gonna be that

2571.51 --> 2575.65
person

2572.43 --> 2576.75
see that that's kind of what my mind did

2575.65 --> 2579.64
with that I

2576.75 --> 2581.68
don't know I did I don't know if that is

2579.64 --> 2584.589
real or if I've already met the person

2581.68 --> 2586.96
or if that by some gruesome twist of

2584.589 --> 2589.42
fate they're actually dead because of

2586.96 --> 2592.829
what the Dark One's did or something I

2589.42 --> 2595.9900000000002
don't know man that gets weird

2592.829 --> 2597.76
they did come because I had this love

2595.99 --> 2600.04
inside me they also with the

2597.76 --> 2600.8100000000004
psychological torture basically told me

2600.04 --> 2602.819
that

2600.81 --> 2605.89
they're all dead

2602.819 --> 2608.74
all these person people that were

2605.89 --> 2609.8689999999997
destined for me okay see how [ __ ] up

2608.74 --> 2612.3999999999996
it gets

2609.869 --> 2615.1800000000003
that's why I don't talk about it a lot

2612.4 --> 2618.369
because it yeah and

2615.18 --> 2621.49
but since I'm figuring out more and more

2618.369 --> 2624.81
that so much is just a pure Bluff even

2621.49 --> 2628.0
like part of that vision it's

2624.81 --> 2629.95
it's giving me a lot of hope and but

2628.0 --> 2633.16
then again the original puzzle like what

2629.95 --> 2635.66
but is it really that he said that

2633.16 --> 2638.81
that's visual

2635.66 --> 2638.81
[Music]

2639.55 --> 2642.42
I don't know

2643.32 --> 2648.1800000000003
if it is destined I will know

2646.26 --> 2651.3900000000003
I'm pretty sure

2648.18 --> 2651.39
what's this

2656.93 --> 2662.69
okay

2658.67 --> 2662.69
no I don't dumb Kelly

2667.92 --> 2671.96
that's no

2674.359 --> 2681.019
no no maybe you do you know you seem to

2679.769 --> 2684.1189999999997
be a squirter

2681.019 --> 2687.5389999999998
breaking that up that is well if you

2684.119 --> 2689.13
bring up squirting like in detail then

2687.539 --> 2691.25
it's a great likelihood you're a

2689.13 --> 2693.7200000000003
squirter

2691.25 --> 2696.049
that's the thing that you're that's on

2693.72 --> 2696.049
your mind

2703.27 --> 2709.03
oh that's that's a good saying unicorn

2706.96 --> 2710.95
Slayer jealousy and resentment can be

2709.03 --> 2714.67
like drinking it poison and then waiting

2710.95 --> 2717.3999999999996
for the other person to die yeah yeah it

2714.67 --> 2719.73
is isn't it that that's very eloquently

2717.4 --> 2719.73
put

2738.52 --> 2745.5099999999998
well John Watson

2740.61 --> 2749.55
while why would you assume that they

2745.51 --> 2749.55
would become part of that nonsense

2749.82 --> 2757.78
microchip try really so I don't know I

2754.23 --> 2759.57
defend my kid to the death to try and

2757.78 --> 2763.4700000000003
prevent that

2759.57 --> 2768.04
and also put out a warning

2763.47 --> 2770.3689999999997
like publicly hey if you're gonna go

2768.04 --> 2772.5
after my kid

2770.369 --> 2777.03
like

2772.5 --> 2777.03
yeah you're gonna have a problem

2788.36 --> 2794.8900000000003
and yeah I will call Bluffs with that

2792.92 --> 2797.89
absolutely I will

2794.89 --> 2797.89
and

2797.92 --> 2804.34
that might get been too troublesome

2800.92 --> 2809.9500000000003
but I will defend myself

2804.34 --> 2812.9900000000002
also afterward in court if necessary

2809.95 --> 2815.7999999999997
but there's just some things that a man

2812.99 --> 2815.7999999999997
has to do

2816.43 --> 2823.33
unless they are freaking Cox and I won't

2821.06 --> 2823.33
be

2824.26 --> 2828.159
[Music]

2856.39 --> 2863.089
all right but yeah in a way also you

2860.089 --> 2866.72
know the thing is is that it could kind

2863.089 --> 2868.67
of work in my view if things kind of

2866.72 --> 2870.549
work if nobody betrays me or anything

2868.67 --> 2875.89
like really bad

2870.549 --> 2879.589
it's very critical if I'd had a kid I

2875.89 --> 2883.67
could even very if they had the same

2879.589 --> 2886.849
level of early manhood impulses it if

2883.67 --> 2890.029
it's a if it's a boy of course I kind of

2886.849 --> 2891.559
hope that being a man it's natural might

2890.029 --> 2892.21
be a girl then it's gonna be something

2891.559 --> 2895.6400000000003
different

2892.21 --> 2898.7
if it's a boy I'm gonna make him very

2895.64 --> 2901.24
early on aware of that the world is

2898.7 --> 2906.3489999999997
dangerous that he's maybe not completely

2901.24 --> 2908.99
understand it yet that he must trust me

2906.349 --> 2911.2400000000002
on that and then I will over time

2908.99 --> 2914.1699999999996
explain him more and more that he was

2911.24 --> 2917.089
that basically the world

2914.17 --> 2919.4500000000003
could only properly be faced as a

2917.089 --> 2923.619
warrior and that

2919.45 --> 2926.93
whirring whirring whirring

2923.619 --> 2931.6400000000003
first and foremost a warrior of the mind

2926.93 --> 2934.99
and that violence is only the absolute

2931.64 --> 2938.5589999999997
desperate last and

2934.99 --> 2942.6189999999997
of any of that I

2938.559 --> 2946.279
guess yeah because if that's what I

2942.619 --> 2948.799
wanted that I wish I had a freaking dad

2946.279 --> 2950.319
that would be exactly like that exactly

2948.799 --> 2953.529
I

2950.319 --> 2957.64
didn't my dad was

2953.529 --> 2957.64
it was afraid to do that

2958.94 --> 2968.369
he is that hadn't done that to him I

2963.29 --> 2973.4
will build a new father tradition if I

2968.369 --> 2973.4
became a dad of boy I damn well will

2982.91 --> 2992.5989999999997
and yeah and that boy would inherit some

2988.2 --> 2992.5989999999997
things with a lot of meaning that I have

2993.74 --> 2999.5299999999997
yeah so I've thought about this [ __ ] a

2997.05 --> 3002.69
long time

2999.53 --> 3006.2000000000003
every time even like ten years ago that

3002.69 --> 3008.119
I bought or ordered something amazing

3006.2 --> 3012.91
made something amazing I always had in

3008.119 --> 3012.9100000000003
mind like everything I do I have to I

3013.66 --> 3019.66
have to have a good story I have to I

3016.66 --> 3019.66
have

3021.67 --> 3028.0
to be able to explain properly like what

3024.95 --> 3030.5
it is why I did that

3028.0 --> 3032.42
because if I just have stories like yeah

3030.5 --> 3034.49
I just [ __ ] around and did idiot

3032.42 --> 3038.27
things wasted she going to the good time

3034.49 --> 3042.29
that's gonna be a terrible story for a

3038.27 --> 3045.77
kid to hear that's not gonna reinforce

3042.29 --> 3047.93
their own feelings of security you have

3045.77 --> 3053.17
to be you have to have a good example

3047.93 --> 3053.1699999999996
and I realized that very early on

3054.83 --> 3057.909
[Music]

3065.4 --> 3070.1600000000003
okay unicorn Slayer the algae I don't

3068.52 --> 3074.97
know I

3070.16 --> 3078.54
think I definitely if I had a kid try

3074.97 --> 3080.7599999999998
and do nature challenges more I never

3078.54 --> 3084.21
really had any serious nature challenges

3080.76 --> 3085.73
with my parents we did love nature as a

3084.21 --> 3089.34
family unit

3085.73 --> 3091.29
right but would always always be more

3089.34 --> 3094.55
like picnicking and that's not real

3091.29 --> 3094.55
nature situation

3096.65 --> 3101.85
but I definitely like go out on a

3099.84 --> 3105.33
challenge with my kid and they've and a

3101.85 --> 3108.0899999999997
proper what do you call a ranger a an

3105.33 --> 3111.89
expert a survivalist that I could trust

3108.09 --> 3116.04
and then go for it

3111.89 --> 3119.52
to both teach myself and my kid and

3116.04 --> 3121.86
maybe get bad in our family culture

3119.52 --> 3123.81
somehow elements of it you know that's

3121.86 --> 3126.23
how where he assimilated things into

3123.81 --> 3128.66
your family culture and then you

3126.23 --> 3132.27
resonate that and

3128.66 --> 3136.02
then that becomes the family thing and I

3132.27 --> 3139.95
want that oh yes I do I want my family

3136.02 --> 3142.16
culture back and I'm going to build it

3139.95 --> 3142.16
