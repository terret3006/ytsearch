165.76 --> 170.64
little bit late

167.44 --> 173.84
but again insane late

170.64 --> 177.11999999999998
night and i wasn't the only one like

173.84 --> 179.76
my like everyone was just up

177.12 --> 181.04
until insanely late and it was like oh

179.76 --> 184.0
[ __ ] it's three o'clock

181.04 --> 185.599
uh let me try to get to bed and just

184.0 --> 188.08
look around like oh

185.599 --> 191.35999999999999
the lights are still on everybody was

188.08 --> 194.56
just watching movies and [ __ ]

191.36 --> 197.76000000000002
so that's been weird

194.56 --> 202.08
but because of that yeah i went i did

197.76 --> 205.35999999999999
also sleep pretty late

202.08 --> 208.64000000000001
as in uh a

205.36 --> 212.48000000000002
quarter to a quarter past one

208.64 --> 215.92
pretty much 45 minutes just wake up

212.48 --> 218.56
get breakfast sort of

215.92 --> 220.79899999999998
didn't really get to it and set up the

218.56 --> 220.799
show

222.319 --> 227.92
and well considering the amount of time

224.319 --> 230.0
i had i thought it was pretty

227.92 --> 231.599
it was on time enough also didn't have

230.0 --> 235.36
any smoke today

231.599 --> 237.92
so that's new yeah let's see

235.36 --> 239.84
how i do without it i'll probably be a

237.92 --> 244.0
lot more chatty

239.84 --> 248.159
rambly also i did have a coffee

244.0 --> 248.159
up until pretty much half an hour ago

251.599 --> 258.0
because i did wake up when i got up

255.2 --> 258.639
i really did had a good sleep and woke

258.0 --> 262.72
up because

258.639 --> 269.84000000000003
the sun was literally just sitting

262.72 --> 269.84000000000003
on my head

281.28 --> 286.479
right anyway uh

288.08 --> 297.84
yeah at least i did make notes yesterday

292.16 --> 297.84000000000003
it's a good thing i think

301.6 --> 307.28000000000003
right yeah here's that that

305.759 --> 309.52000000000004
it's something i kind of forgot to

307.28 --> 310.88
mention it's happened a while ago i just

309.52 --> 312.71999999999997
didn't really know what to

310.88 --> 314.0
think about it in the face of everything

312.72 --> 316.0
else is happening

314.0 --> 318.08
and apparently trump made this really

316.0 --> 321.68
big piece deal

318.08 --> 325.68
in the middle east that's it

321.68 --> 329.12
is it a israel bahrain

325.68 --> 329.12
uh the the other one

331.6 --> 337.91900000000004
and the united states that

334.639 --> 338.639
like whoa that's like really good and of

337.919 --> 342.71999999999997
course

338.639 --> 345.36
of course israel is a part in that

342.72 --> 346.96000000000004
because i don't know is trump now only

345.36 --> 349.6
allowed to do

346.96 --> 353.19899999999996
awesome things if israel is involved is

349.6 --> 355.84000000000003
he like the public relations

353.199 --> 358.0
face saving guy for israel now is that

355.84 --> 360.23999999999995
his function

358.0 --> 361.52
is that what he he he's really there to

360.24 --> 366.16
do

361.52 --> 368.0
because yeah and like terrible [ __ ]

366.16 --> 370.24
is going down the united states he

368.0 --> 372.88
doesn't seem to

370.24 --> 374.96000000000004
really do anything about it but in the

372.88 --> 377.52
middle east or anywhere else oh it's all

374.96 --> 378.23999999999995
special he's such a great diplomat and

377.52 --> 382.79999999999995
of course

378.24 --> 382.8
it's gonna be with israel

386.8 --> 393.52000000000004
it's i don't know man

390.639 --> 395.36
at this point i don't know if trump even

393.52 --> 398.4
knows it

395.36 --> 400.319
like if he's really conscious about what

398.4 --> 402.0
it is and the consequences but i think

400.319 --> 408.40000000000003
he's effectively just

402.0 --> 410.96
a open zionist at this point

408.4 --> 412.08
and that in the presence density

410.96 --> 414.479
function is

412.08 --> 417.19899999999996
it is atrocious you know in the face of

414.479 --> 417.199
everything else

424.8 --> 429.12
so yeah trump it's all really nice that

427.12 --> 431.12
you're trump and it's all special and

429.12 --> 434.56
trump trump trump trump everywhere

431.12 --> 437.68
trump everything but this israel [ __ ]

434.56 --> 440.88
and you being a zionist

437.68 --> 444.319
that's a big no-no and

440.88 --> 444.319
it's not gonna be alright

445.12 --> 449.36
it's really nice that you wanna help

447.52 --> 451.19899999999996
peace in the middle east

449.36 --> 454.47900000000004
oh there's some there's pretty much

451.199 --> 454.479
things you can do about it

455.68 --> 462.0
and yeah from what perspective you are

459.44 --> 463.039
are are you is it effective real peace

462.0 --> 465.039
or is it basic

463.039 --> 466.31899999999996
yeah i don't even know what it is

465.039 --> 468.4
anymore but

466.319 --> 470.96000000000004
people are getting kind of sick of the

468.4 --> 474.4
association

470.96 --> 477.599
you know so like

474.4 --> 481.44
america is not about israel

477.599 --> 484.08
yeah yeah i know a lot of bibles and

481.44 --> 487.12
stuff and mormons even yeah they talk

484.08 --> 489.35999999999996
about israel all the time

487.12 --> 491.68
let's stick to the freaking country

489.36 --> 495.12
you're actually the president of

491.68 --> 495.12
you know that's

498.24 --> 507.84000000000003
their peace is [ __ ] and death yeah

511.68 --> 514.719
we'll see about it

515.599 --> 519.36
i i i don't know enough to say anything

518.08 --> 522.64
about it but

519.36 --> 522.64
i have my suspicions

522.959 --> 527.68
you know like israel is not a state of

526.399 --> 529.839
peace

527.68 --> 531.04
it's not like the people in there might

529.839 --> 534.72
be that just

531.04 --> 537.36
generally live there the normies

534.72 --> 538.88
but the state itself it's it's always

537.36 --> 541.839
freaking hostile it is

538.88 --> 542.48
it is it's always been like that in the

541.839 --> 545.6
beginning

542.48 --> 548.72
extremely hostile

545.6 --> 551.6800000000001
like terrorist level just

548.72 --> 553.519
openly everything for self-defense

551.68 --> 554.0799999999999
whatever the [ __ ] that's supposed to

553.519 --> 556.08
mean

554.08 --> 558.0
and oh yeah it turns out that you

556.08 --> 558.9590000000001
constantly abuse it to get away with

558.0 --> 563.12
[ __ ] too

558.959 --> 567.1999999999999
sounds familiar right where

563.12 --> 569.519
what israelis abusing

567.2 --> 572.48
things to get away with something wow

569.519 --> 572.48
that's unheard of

575.519 --> 578.88
so yeah usually if that if there's some

578.64 --> 581.04
p

578.88 --> 583.76
situation it usually means okay they're

581.04 --> 586.3199999999999
just conspiring to basically

583.76 --> 588.3199999999999
covertly undermine everybody else so

586.32 --> 591.44
okay no more

588.32 --> 593.279
open attacks it's just now secret

591.44 --> 595.9200000000001
service is just gonna wreak havoc

593.279 --> 599.12
and blow [ __ ] up secret and then they're

595.92 --> 603.04
gonna have to deal with it themselves

599.12 --> 603.04
that's usually what that means

603.519 --> 607.839
yeah and israel is probably not the only

606.399 --> 612.32
one

607.839 --> 612.32
that has that sort of strategy

615.2 --> 620.72
save lebanon it's all completely useless

618.16 --> 620.7199999999999
rasta

622.88 --> 630.32
there is no saving it like either israel

626.24 --> 630.32
wins or it's going to be a giant crater

630.72 --> 634.0790000000001
you know who we're dealing with here

632.399 --> 636.88
right

634.079 --> 637.4399999999999
these people basically invented the

636.88 --> 640.56
skirt

637.44 --> 643.7600000000001
the scorched earth policy so

640.56 --> 647.3599999999999
it's they're never getting it back

643.76 --> 649.92
okay never ever ever

647.36 --> 652.399
they'd rather turn the entire place into

649.92 --> 655.8389999999999
a giant crater than ever give it back

652.399 --> 658.88
ever so it's never gonna happen

655.839 --> 662.0790000000001
it's ridiculous this

658.88 --> 675.8389999999999
this notion that they're just gonna give

662.079 --> 675.8389999999999
it back it's never gonna happen

682.56 --> 688.3199999999999
yay uh yeah it's all that it's

685.68 --> 688.959
all that it's all satan right yeah

688.32 --> 692.72
because

688.959 --> 693.76
israel is satan they are the pinnacle of

692.72 --> 696.24
all evil they have

693.76 --> 697.279
everything under control i think at

696.24 --> 699.6
least they'd like to

697.279 --> 703.04
think to make everybody think that they

699.6 --> 706.8000000000001
do i think it's part of their strategy

703.04 --> 709.12
they want to be seen as the secret satan

706.8 --> 710.4799999999999
almighty controller that has all the

709.12 --> 712.72
foreign knowledge and that has

710.48 --> 714.16
everybody blackmail that's what they

712.72 --> 716.32
want

714.16 --> 719.76
everyone to believe do you understand

716.32 --> 723.9200000000001
that that is their policy

719.76 --> 727.2
it's their policy they do it on purpose

723.92 --> 731.04
you understand that and then things get

727.2 --> 734.1600000000001
a little complicated

731.04 --> 736.959
do they really or how much of it is

734.16 --> 736.959
really a bluff

737.04 --> 744.48
see then things get really

740.16 --> 747.36
confusing really [ __ ] confusing

744.48 --> 747.9200000000001
because yeah that bluff strategy seems

747.36 --> 753.44
to be

747.92 --> 756.7199999999999
damn effective really [ __ ] effective

753.44 --> 758.0790000000001
so yeah is it good

756.72 --> 761.279
that's something else that it's

758.079 --> 765.04
effective and it certainly seems like

761.279 --> 767.6
that method that the united states has

765.04 --> 772.079
kind of adopted that method as well

767.6 --> 773.6
just pure bluff covert overpowering just

772.079 --> 776.4799999999999
give the suggestion

773.6 --> 777.36
like yeah we yeah we lie we deceive we

776.48 --> 779.839
will

777.36 --> 781.2
brutalize and humiliate our own people

779.839 --> 786.639
because we are that

781.2 --> 789.36
powerful and we can get away with it

786.639 --> 790.48
that's like the international policy

789.36 --> 793.519
covertly

790.48 --> 793.519
it's a suggestion

794.56 --> 798.0
right because hey if a country can just

797.279 --> 800.24
literally

798.0 --> 801.76
execute their own people or just

800.24 --> 804.8
humiliate them

801.76 --> 807.6
make them take crap until they

804.8 --> 808.88
literally die convulsing on the streets

807.6 --> 812.16
and [ __ ]

808.88 --> 814.16
yeah that's a signal towards other

812.16 --> 815.4399999999999
psychopaths and other governments like

814.16 --> 817.68
whoa [ __ ]

815.44 --> 819.6
they really have a strong mind control

817.68 --> 821.5999999999999
there yeah we're not gonna [ __ ] with

819.6 --> 822.639
them because they'll stare their people

821.6 --> 827.12
to just go in

822.639 --> 829.519
berserk suicidal bomber mode against us

827.12 --> 830.399
mm-hmm yeah that's the reality of it

829.519 --> 832.9590000000001
okay that's

830.399 --> 834.32
that's how the [ __ ] world really

832.959 --> 837.4399999999999
works

834.32 --> 837.44
do you do you get it

838.0 --> 842.32
you know when when it is said even

840.8 --> 846.0
through biblical sources

842.32 --> 848.8000000000001
evil satan is in control of the world

846.0 --> 849.279
that's not just a generalized saying and

848.8 --> 852.3199999999999
a

849.279 --> 853.279
starting sign for you to just oh it's

852.32 --> 856.1600000000001
satan

853.279 --> 857.279
let's look away and not learn anything

856.16 --> 859.279
about it right

857.279 --> 860.399
right because that's what most people do

859.279 --> 863.199
oh it's satan

860.399 --> 866.079
let's not learn about it it's dude it's

863.199 --> 869.68
dark it's not good for my heart

866.079 --> 873.12
but yeah you could also just

869.68 --> 876.2399999999999
try to figure out okay what do people

873.12 --> 878.399
that do not have their hearts activated

876.24 --> 880.0
how do they function what is going on

878.399 --> 883.76
what is the game they're playing

880.0 --> 886.959
how does that work so you find out

883.76 --> 888.8
and then you eventually can predict how

886.959 --> 891.279
countries will respond

888.8 --> 892.399
to situations on the short run on the

891.279 --> 895.12
long run

892.399 --> 897.76
and then after you get that roughly

895.12 --> 901.6
figured out then you start to see

897.76 --> 905.36
how their out of place responses

901.6 --> 905.839
are actually signs of other strategies

905.36 --> 907.92
and

905.839 --> 909.36
yeah complex details that's how it

907.92 --> 912.16
really works

909.36 --> 912.8000000000001
and i am not even a freaking expert but

912.16 --> 917.519
i

912.8 --> 917.519
expert enough to have seen experts and

917.68 --> 922.7199999999999
study people study information that's

920.079 --> 922.7199999999999
how it works

924.48 --> 929.6
there's the public side the goody

926.72 --> 933.0400000000001
two-shoes faced side

929.6 --> 936.48
and then there's the unspoken dark

933.04 --> 941.199
autocratic power side

936.48 --> 944.0
and those two sides matter continually

941.199 --> 946.0
it's always the op the overt and the

944.0 --> 949.36
covert

946.0 --> 952.399
and the covert matters just as much

949.36 --> 954.88
as the overt that's just how it works

952.399 --> 956.959
there's no way around it and if you

954.88 --> 960.079
don't recognize it then you

956.959 --> 961.92
are going then you are misled you're not

960.079 --> 969.8389999999999
gonna get what the [ __ ] going on in

961.92 --> 969.8389999999999
the world

973.92 --> 980.8389999999999
i should not smoke more often before

977.44 --> 983.839
in the show this is actually working out

980.839 --> 983.839
great

985.92 --> 990.079
note jd the bible is not a fictional

988.399 --> 991.279
storybook

990.079 --> 997.8389999999999
i don't know what the [ __ ] you're

991.279 --> 997.8389999999999
talking about

1002.959 --> 1011.8389999999999
certain things are just beyond fiction

1014.079 --> 1017.4399999999999
no no it's not

1017.92 --> 1024.8799999999999
it's not fiction you don't know

1022.079 --> 1026.079
barely people understand it now it's not

1024.88 --> 1031.1200000000001
about proving it

1026.079 --> 1034.48
it's about what what is in there

1031.12 --> 1039.839
what is happening what people do get

1034.48 --> 1039.839
to understand from it

1040.319 --> 1046.799
mostly fiction no no it's not

1043.679 --> 1049.2800000000002
it's just not it's not mostly fiction

1046.799 --> 1051.12
it's probably more historical than

1049.28 --> 1054.48
fiction

1051.12 --> 1056.9599999999998
the thing is there is just

1054.48 --> 1058.32
weird things in there a lot of people

1056.96 --> 1061.44
have

1058.32 --> 1064.3999999999999
or yeah have had their hands on it

1061.44 --> 1064.799
and the translation matters everything

1064.4 --> 1067.1200000000001
it

1064.799 --> 1068.6399999999999
literally matters everything there's

1067.12 --> 1072.1599999999999
things that could not be

1068.64 --> 1072.96
translated like it's impossible to do

1072.16 --> 1074.72
that

1072.96 --> 1076.16
in the language properly so they just

1074.72 --> 1078.48
change it and their fight

1076.16 --> 1080.3200000000002
thereby changing the code and that kind

1078.48 --> 1084.559
of breaks the whole

1080.32 --> 1086.559
deeper oversight that naturally arrives

1084.559 --> 1088.32
and even with that bread with those

1086.559 --> 1095.84
bricks i can still just

1088.32 --> 1095.84
get through it

1099.12 --> 1103.76
right truth among lies in all religion

1101.12 --> 1107.12
that's because all religions

1103.76 --> 1112.16
all of them that exist right now

1107.12 --> 1112.1599999999999
are publicly followed

1114.4 --> 1120.4
that are lived they're all grappled

1117.76 --> 1120.96
that means that they are literally

1120.4 --> 1124.0800000000002
touched

1120.96 --> 1127.2
by jesuits touched altered things

1124.08 --> 1131.12
censored things taken out other things

1127.2 --> 1133.919
in introduced like

1131.12 --> 1135.12
things rewritten in a certain way with

1133.919 --> 1137.44
certain codes

1135.12 --> 1138.4799999999998
to be placed in that religion in the

1137.44 --> 1140.88
reformation of it

1138.48 --> 1142.48
yeah they did that hundreds of years ago

1140.88 --> 1146.0800000000002
everywhere every

1142.48 --> 1149.679
every written religion that has been

1146.08 --> 1151.76
ever known at this point like what the

1149.679 --> 1154.5590000000002
actual content of the religion is

1151.76 --> 1156.08
not just a fake shadow of some cult or

1154.559 --> 1159.28
religion in the past now

1156.08 --> 1161.4399999999998
every religion that exists has been

1159.28 --> 1162.96
influenced by jesuits because they went

1161.44 --> 1166.96
around the world

1162.96 --> 1170.64
and has changed it that doesn't mean

1166.96 --> 1174.72
that it's not true it's just been

1170.64 --> 1174.72
mutilated you could say altered

1175.039 --> 1179.6
and then yeah the mutilated and the

1178.16 --> 1182.16
altered parts will

1179.6 --> 1183.52
give a weird feeling off them it will be

1182.16 --> 1185.44
like that's different

1183.52 --> 1186.799
that's different than the rest there's

1185.44 --> 1188.88
something wrong with this

1186.799 --> 1190.4
and there's people that'll feel that

1188.88 --> 1194.0
right rest ahead

1190.4 --> 1195.44
right jd shizzle they'll feel that and

1194.0 --> 1198.32
it'll be like

1195.44 --> 1199.919
okay that means i can just throw it all

1198.32 --> 1202.24
in the garbage because it's all

1199.919 --> 1203.2
fake yeah yeah yeah well you're gonna

1202.24 --> 1205.2
miss a lot

1203.2 --> 1206.96
because if you go by that standard in

1205.2 --> 1209.44
your learning guess what

1206.96 --> 1210.08
everything you ever learned from every

1209.44 --> 1212.559
person

1210.08 --> 1213.4399999999998
ever you can just all throw that in the

1212.559 --> 1215.28
garbage

1213.44 --> 1216.48
because every person that teaches

1215.28 --> 1220.1589999999999
something

1216.48 --> 1223.3600000000001
to anyone very likely

1220.159 --> 1223.8400000000001
to insert some kind of [ __ ] some

1223.36 --> 1226.9599999999998
kind of

1223.84 --> 1231.1999999999998
personal twist some kind of political

1226.96 --> 1232.96
narrative angle every [ __ ] time they

1231.2 --> 1235.44
open their mouths

1232.96 --> 1237.6000000000001
every [ __ ] time so you can just take

1235.44 --> 1240.0800000000002
all the knowledge you've ever gathered

1237.6 --> 1240.799
and just throw it in the garbage just

1240.08 --> 1243.1999999999998
like that

1240.799 --> 1244.24
because it's not pure anymore you know

1243.2 --> 1246.4
it's all been

1244.24 --> 1248.64
uttered by man it's all been manipulated

1246.4 --> 1253.039
by men everything you've ever heard

1248.64 --> 1256.72
ever okay so

1253.039 --> 1259.28
yeah you don't know [ __ ]

1256.72 --> 1260.0
you don't know that you know very little

1259.28 --> 1264.32
no no

1260.0 --> 1267.44
you know literally nothing literally

1264.32 --> 1269.039
nothing if you go by that standard if

1267.44 --> 1272.64
you can't

1269.039 --> 1276.32
take a big scoop of information and then

1272.64 --> 1279.039
isolate the good part and then isolate

1276.32 --> 1279.76
the corrupted part and then take both

1279.039 --> 1281.679
parts

1279.76 --> 1282.8799999999999
separately for what they are if you

1281.679 --> 1284.72
can't do that

1282.88 --> 1288.0800000000002
then what the [ __ ] are you even doing

1284.72 --> 1290.72
here get the [ __ ] out of here man

1288.08 --> 1291.6789999999999
information is information and all the

1290.72 --> 1294.4
information

1291.679 --> 1296.159
is all is never a hundred percent pure

1294.4 --> 1296.5590000000002
it's impossible because it's coming

1296.159 --> 1300.0800000000002
through

1296.559 --> 1303.44
man it's being absorbed by man

1300.08 --> 1305.84
passed on to man yeah it's gonna be

1303.44 --> 1305.8400000000001
polluted

1312.0 --> 1316.84
you don't feel a sense of goodness of

1314.48 --> 1318.08
spit or spirit when you read the bible

1316.84 --> 1322.559
rasta

1318.08 --> 1322.559
well are you supposed to

1322.96 --> 1327.1200000000001
i know that all the churchians all the

1324.96 --> 1330.32
christians love to say oh

1327.12 --> 1332.9599999999998
just read the bible and you will become

1330.32 --> 1335.4399999999998
possessed by god right i've never

1332.96 --> 1338.24
experienced that either

1335.44 --> 1339.919
because that doesn't happen it doesn't

1338.24 --> 1341.679
it only happens

1339.919 --> 1342.96
from external energy if you're gonna do

1341.679 --> 1344.48
that [ __ ]

1342.96 --> 1346.0
with other people that are all

1344.48 --> 1349.3600000000001
exhilarated about it and

1346.0 --> 1354.24
you about you learning these things

1349.36 --> 1354.24
that they worship they worship the words

1354.64 --> 1357.8400000000001
they worship the writing yeah that

1357.2 --> 1360.72
energy

1357.84 --> 1362.559
can trans transfer on to you in that

1360.72 --> 1364.559
experience and then the acceleration

1362.559 --> 1365.76
is not even from reading the bible it's

1364.559 --> 1368.96
from

1365.76 --> 1369.36
the rest of the people connecting onto

1368.96 --> 1371.52
you

1369.36 --> 1373.4399999999998
that is the exhilarating experience not

1371.52 --> 1375.12
even technically reading the bible

1373.44 --> 1376.559
because when i read the bible i just

1375.12 --> 1379.84
read it for what it is

1376.559 --> 1380.72
the thing is i see so [ __ ] much in

1379.84 --> 1385.6
there

1380.72 --> 1389.48
that is just of unimaginable value

1385.6 --> 1391.84
like intricate wisdom that is

1389.48 --> 1393.919
unbelievably difficult to even

1391.84 --> 1402.1589999999999
communicate

1393.919 --> 1404.0800000000002
that is what is in there

1402.159 --> 1406.0800000000002
and if you can't pick that up you got a

1404.08 --> 1409.52
problem you got distracted

1406.08 --> 1411.36
you got distracted again that's what the

1409.52 --> 1414.48
ego's really good at

1411.36 --> 1415.76
finding a reason not to do it it's

1414.48 --> 1431.84
really good at it

1415.76 --> 1431.84
it's very tough for people

1438.08 --> 1445.9189999999999
who gives a [ __ ] amen

1441.44 --> 1448.799
did you know that people probably

1445.919 --> 1450.48
two three thousand years ago that there

1448.799 --> 1456.08
were groups of people just

1450.48 --> 1456.08
eating each other yeah so what

1457.12 --> 1464.9599999999998
poliastic religions who gives a [ __ ]

1461.2 --> 1468.48
what does that mean like it's a religion

1464.96 --> 1471.52
religion technically doesn't mean [ __ ]

1468.48 --> 1474.64
it's just a incorporated cult

1471.52 --> 1478.72
system with ecstatics right right

1474.64 --> 1481.8400000000001
religions are only only

1478.72 --> 1484.88
about exoterics right because

1481.84 --> 1487.9189999999999
if it's not then there's nothing to do

1484.88 --> 1490.4
because the real lessons are all

1487.919 --> 1491.279
esoteric and they're all of the

1490.4 --> 1494.48
individual

1491.279 --> 1498.84
inside themselves not to utilize

1494.48 --> 1502.08
for power control or anything

1498.84 --> 1505.52
right because as christ specifically

1502.08 --> 1508.559
said like the religion

1505.52 --> 1510.559
is you and you

1508.559 --> 1513.039
you having that connection with god

1510.559 --> 1516.559
individually and it

1513.039 --> 1519.84
yeah that's the real lesson

1516.559 --> 1522.799
that's his that is primarily

1519.84 --> 1524.72
what makes christ so unbelievably

1522.799 --> 1527.279
powerful

1524.72 --> 1528.4
in comparison to everything else that is

1527.279 --> 1532.64
that he was a

1528.4 --> 1535.6000000000001
spiritual enlightened anarchist that

1532.64 --> 1535.6000000000001
really got it

1535.679 --> 1539.919
that knew this fact that even the

1538.32 --> 1542.24
religion

1539.919 --> 1543.76
that his teachings would become a part

1542.24 --> 1546.96
of would violate

1543.76 --> 1550.0
and try to mislead from he knew it he

1546.96 --> 1551.76
knew it okay all that wisdom all that

1550.0 --> 1557.84
insight you know how valuable that is

1551.76 --> 1557.84
how unique that is in this world

1560.96 --> 1566.24
yeah so we're not talking about religion

1563.2 --> 1566.24
i'm not religious

1568.08 --> 1571.84
i don't follow a religion

1572.72 --> 1577.2
i follow essence i follow principles i

1575.52 --> 1580.799
follow methodology

1577.2 --> 1584.72
and i trust my intuition and i trust

1580.799 --> 1587.6
god through me i trust

1584.72 --> 1589.76
his information his presentation the

1587.6 --> 1590.6399999999999
energy response that i get for my

1589.76 --> 1592.799
actions

1590.64 --> 1593.919
because i try to live logos the things

1592.799 --> 1597.12
that i've actually

1593.919 --> 1600.88
learned from christ and through

1597.12 --> 1602.08
other people from christ not about the

1600.88 --> 1604.7990000000002
christ religion

1602.08 --> 1606.3999999999999
not about christianity no no it's the

1604.799 --> 1610.4
lessons

1606.4 --> 1612.3200000000002
the real really powerful lessons

1610.4 --> 1615.279
that aren't generally taught because

1612.32 --> 1615.279
it's not profitable

1615.76 --> 1620.48
that's what i follow

1618.37 --> 1622.08
[Music]

1620.48 --> 1623.679
yeah you don't even know what the [ __ ]

1622.08 --> 1626.0
you're talking about you don't even know

1623.679 --> 1629.6000000000001
what i'm talking about rest hat

1626.0 --> 1632.159
just saying you don't know

1629.6 --> 1632.7199999999998
because you're saying this people can

1632.159 --> 1636.5590000000002
only

1632.72 --> 1636.559
say those things out of ignorance

1639.039 --> 1643.039
if you don't follow the so-called

1641.44 --> 1644.72
lessons then you don't know what the

1643.039 --> 1647.84
[ __ ] they are

1644.72 --> 1647.84
you don't understand them

1650.159 --> 1655.6000000000001
and if you don't want to fine don't go

1653.6 --> 1658.9599999999998
and protest it

1655.6 --> 1661.76
you know every time a person that just

1658.96 --> 1663.3600000000001
doesn't like christianity for whatever

1661.76 --> 1666.24
reason for the person

1663.36 --> 1667.279
for the historical details for the

1666.24 --> 1671.039
corruption for

1667.279 --> 1674.08
anything anytime anyone expresses

1671.039 --> 1674.08
christ's allergy

1674.64 --> 1679.5200000000002
you're wrong that's literally your

1677.279 --> 1682.96
ignorance on the inside

1679.52 --> 1685.2
trying to find excuses to reject christ

1682.96 --> 1686.72
now you got a problem there and that's a

1685.2 --> 1689.76
real problem

1686.72 --> 1691.6000000000001
and it's your problem so keep it to

1689.76 --> 1693.36
yourself

1691.6 --> 1694.6399999999999
because it's just going to piss off

1693.36 --> 1698.6399999999999
people that didn't

1694.64 --> 1698.64
have the trouble making that step

1703.52 --> 1705.9189999999999
all right

1707.679 --> 1711.279
it will lead to failure well that look

1710.32 --> 1714.8799999999999
surrendering

1711.279 --> 1718.72
your spiritual authority always

1714.88 --> 1721.279
leads to failure and pain always

1718.72 --> 1722.159
because that's the whole point you have

1721.279 --> 1727.36
to

1722.159 --> 1727.3600000000001
the whole core lesson like it and

1728.159 --> 1731.679
you know people 50 years ago just used

1731.36 --> 1735.6789999999999
to

1731.679 --> 1737.279
know this by default nobody even talked

1735.679 --> 1740.3200000000002
about it because it was so

1737.279 --> 1746.48
normal that is christ is

1740.32 --> 1750.1589999999999
about taking responsibility

1746.48 --> 1753.2
taking and that means doing something

1750.159 --> 1756.3990000000001
you don't want wanna do because it's

1753.2 --> 1759.3600000000001
tough because practically

1756.399 --> 1760.1589999999999
you could do something easier and then

1759.36 --> 1764.399
get along

1760.159 --> 1766.159
easier that's the the responsibility of

1764.399 --> 1770.08
take doing something that is more

1766.159 --> 1770.0800000000002
tough going through it

1770.399 --> 1775.9189999999999
that is really

1773.76 --> 1777.679
what people even used to know per

1775.919 --> 1780.72
default

1777.679 --> 1784.0800000000002
and it's kind of like faded away like

1780.72 --> 1786.48
selfish short-term pragmatism

1784.08 --> 1787.4399999999998
is now being normalized as an

1786.48 --> 1791.3600000000001
alternative to

1787.44 --> 1791.3600000000001
just growing the [ __ ] up

1792.0 --> 1798.559
take the strain and do the right

1795.36 --> 1801.76
thing and become a better man or woman

1798.559 --> 1802.96
stronger wiser more responsible more

1801.76 --> 1806.48
respected

1802.96 --> 1806.96
for it that was his one of his primary

1806.48 --> 1809.52
lessons

1806.96 --> 1811.1200000000001
is like the core of it all like

1809.52 --> 1814.799
otherwise you'll just be

1811.12 --> 1817.76
weak lost that was

1814.799 --> 1820.48
that was like the core essence of his

1817.76 --> 1823.84
entire teachings

1820.48 --> 1823.84
don't you see it

1826.799 --> 1830.48
get the [ __ ] out of here shizzle

1830.799 --> 1837.84
wanker you don't know what the [ __ ]

1833.2 --> 1837.8400000000001
you're talking about

1849.039 --> 1853.679
what real god as in the fallen angels

1851.76 --> 1856.32
the dark ones

1853.679 --> 1857.919
that are trying to conquer the material

1856.32 --> 1860.399
realm

1857.919 --> 1861.1200000000001
from within the spiritual realm those

1860.399 --> 1863.6789999999999
gods

1861.12 --> 1865.12
hey if you want to worship them and do

1863.679 --> 1868.5590000000002
what they'd like to do

1865.12 --> 1872.08
go ahead all right

1868.559 --> 1875.44
you do that have a lot of fun with it

1872.08 --> 1877.4399999999998
and see how they like to pull you down a

1875.44 --> 1878.96
slippery slope because that's what they

1877.44 --> 1882.3200000000002
all do

1878.96 --> 1884.72
in every form it's what happens when you

1882.32 --> 1888.72
engage with the pantheon

1884.72 --> 1892.32
the non-creator yeah

1888.72 --> 1894.88
yeah i kind of know from

1892.32 --> 1897.519
experience not that i went too far with

1894.88 --> 1900.7990000000002
that but i know how it works

1897.519 --> 1902.72
i've considered

1900.799 --> 1905.279
that i might have actually been in a

1902.72 --> 1909.3600000000001
direct contact

1905.279 --> 1912.96
like that it's pretty astounding

1909.36 --> 1916.24
that's a long time ago all right

1912.96 --> 1918.88
so you go and do that

1916.24 --> 1920.159
have a lot of fun with the old gods as

1918.88 --> 1922.24
they call them

1920.159 --> 1923.679
you just do your thing just see how that

1922.24 --> 1928.32
works out in the end

1923.679 --> 1931.8400000000001
right i'm going to live

1928.32 --> 1934.08
by christ's example as much as i can

1931.84 --> 1935.9189999999999
but also realize that i am basically a

1934.08 --> 1940.32
perverted human being

1935.919 --> 1943.76
with an ego an ego that has a lot of say

1940.32 --> 1945.6789999999999
in my being basically to as a purpose to

1943.76 --> 1947.279
off balance everything else i have

1945.679 --> 1948.88
because the more power you have the more

1947.279 --> 1950.72
insight you have the more

1948.88 --> 1951.919
intelligence and oversight the stronger

1950.72 --> 1955.519
your ego will be

1951.919 --> 1962.64
and that's natural law

1955.519 --> 1964.559
it's how human beings work you got a lot

1962.64 --> 1966.0
of power then you got a lot of ego to

1964.559 --> 1969.84
contest with

1966.0 --> 1972.24
and yeah too much power too much ego

1969.84 --> 1973.1999999999998
usually means the ego takes control of

1972.24 --> 1976.48
you

1973.2 --> 1978.799
and will literally fool your

1976.48 --> 1981.679
consciousness

1978.799 --> 1982.1589999999999
it will make you not see things and hey

1981.679 --> 1984.72
that's

1982.159 --> 1986.5590000000002
that effect might sound very familiar

1984.72 --> 1988.559
because the ballers have that all the

1986.559 --> 1991.6
time

1988.559 --> 1992.799
where the their ego is in control of a

1991.6 --> 1995.84
certain program

1992.799 --> 1998.399
and their ego literally just switches

1995.84 --> 2000.559
information out of sight of your very

1998.399 --> 2001.9189999999999
consciousness so you don't pick up on it

2000.559 --> 2003.76
even though it's there it's like a

2001.919 --> 2006.24
self-hypnotism effect

2003.76 --> 2007.44
the ego does these things to people all

2006.24 --> 2010.32
the time

2007.44 --> 2012.559
especially if they're very smart smarter

2010.32 --> 2013.6789999999999
you are the quicker of mind the more

2012.559 --> 2018.0
insight you

2013.679 --> 2020.159
easily attain the more powerful your ego

2018.0 --> 2020.159
is

2025.679 --> 2032.159
what are you whining about rest ahead

2029.679 --> 2035.3600000000001
you don't know what that is you

2032.159 --> 2035.3600000000001
literally don't know

2037.679 --> 2041.6000000000001
i think that probably christ could have

2040.159 --> 2043.6000000000001
turned water to wine

2041.6 --> 2047.84
and could have literally just

2043.6 --> 2049.839
materialized fish just like that

2047.84 --> 2051.359
but it's it it's not gonna be without

2049.839 --> 2053.44
consequence

2051.359 --> 2054.72
like all these things are probably in

2053.44 --> 2058.0
direct line with

2054.72 --> 2058.0
his eventual death

2058.079 --> 2063.119
it this stuff is just [ __ ]

2060.32 --> 2063.119
complicated

2065.599 --> 2069.76
yeah very smart by the way to stay away

2068.24 --> 2072.72
from boost the older you get

2069.76 --> 2074.0
the more impact it makes and hey but you

2072.72 --> 2076.7999999999997
can still

2074.0 --> 2080.639
he created alcohol now that's not true

2076.8 --> 2080.639
he definitely did not do that

2083.28 --> 2087.76
you know and hey wine especially good

2086.079 --> 2090.96
wine

2087.76 --> 2093.2000000000003
it can be very good and releasing if you

2090.96 --> 2096.48
don't drink it all day long

2093.2 --> 2098.56
you know and christ just did not promote

2096.48 --> 2103.839
everybody drinking all day long no there

2098.56 --> 2103.839
were just times for celebration

2106.48 --> 2114.2400000000002
no no it's not

2110.32 --> 2116.88
everything in moderation is is doable

2114.24 --> 2117.839
and wine too wine can be very healthy

2116.88 --> 2131.839
actually

2117.839 --> 2131.839
if you take it in moderation

2143.359 --> 2147.92
yeah your liver is not gonna explode

2146.32 --> 2150.4
from drinking

2147.92 --> 2152.32
some wine every now and then rest ahead

2150.4 --> 2154.32
unless you've already got your liver

2152.32 --> 2156.6400000000003
under great duress

2154.32 --> 2158.56
yeah then it might be the drop that make

2156.64 --> 2163.52
it burst or something

2158.56 --> 2163.52
but yeah it's just not true right

2171.04 --> 2177.7599999999998
everything in moderation you know

2174.8 --> 2178.2400000000002
like drinking too much coffee certain

2177.76 --> 2182.48
people

2178.24 --> 2182.4799999999996
can also literally kill you

2183.92 --> 2190.16
dude drinking too much water

2187.68 --> 2192.96
all at once can literally kill you you

2190.16 --> 2196.0
can be poisoned by that

2192.96 --> 2201.839
official you can literally die

2196.0 --> 2201.839
from drinking too much water so

2228.56 --> 2234.0
too much coffee makes me bum swell okie

2231.76 --> 2234.0
do

2235.119 --> 2240.839
well i never drink too much coffee

2237.04 --> 2242.72
because with me i get serious muscle

2240.839 --> 2257.839
cramps

2242.72 --> 2257.839
and my jaw starts to get annoyed

2262.96 --> 2269.699
[Music]

2278.079 --> 2285.04
anyway i think that

2282.32 --> 2285.76
that little speech is over now i think i

2285.04 --> 2288.8
got

2285.76 --> 2288.8
my points across

2295.52 --> 2302.079
oh yeah i completely forgot

2298.72 --> 2303.7599999999998

thank you for reminding me by the way

2337.92 --> 2342.8
oprah mukul

2340.8 --> 2344.1600000000003
but yeah benjamin yesterday was pretty

2342.8 --> 2345.8390000000004
damn funny and

2344.16 --> 2347.44
like there's this new video i don't know

2345.839 --> 2348.64
who made it though it's not mountain

2347.44 --> 2351.599
bear

2348.64 --> 2353.04
couldn't find it back the grabler

2351.599 --> 2358.7200000000003
leprechaun

2353.04 --> 2358.72
very extensive four cents uss

2366.839 --> 2371.839
okay

2369.76 --> 2373.6800000000003
but anyway yeah the theme was grappler

2371.839 --> 2375.7599999999998
left come

2373.68 --> 2378.0
and it was funny i want to see it back

2375.76 --> 2381.119
like i laughed pretty hard

2378.0 --> 2382.24
oh yeah also i bet i kind of came to the

2381.119 --> 2385.52
conclusions like

2382.24 --> 2389.2
just generally thinking about it like

2385.52 --> 2393.359
chastity belts chastity belts might be

2389.2 --> 2397.1189999999997
pretty they could be like re-modernized

2393.359 --> 2402.24
and made into anti-squirt belts

2397.119 --> 2404.88
you know like how do you

2402.24 --> 2405.839
i know it's it's super old-fashioned and

2404.88 --> 2408.1600000000003
it's kind of like

2405.839 --> 2410.16
not from this time anymore which means

2408.16 --> 2413.359
it should be reintroduced to

2410.16 --> 2415.2
break that stupid mindset of this time

2413.359 --> 2417.92
that it's okay for everybody to turn

2415.2 --> 2419.96
into useless quarters and be outraged

2417.92 --> 2421.76
about the world not being

2419.96 --> 2423.76
self-destructive enough

2421.76 --> 2426.96
because of leftist thinking so let's

2423.76 --> 2430.0
just bring the chastity belt back

2426.96 --> 2430.0
and modernize it

2431.52 --> 2436.0
like it doesn't have to be all iron

2433.92 --> 2439.119
anymore that you have this big

2436.0 --> 2441.119
weighty thing you could have

2439.119 --> 2442.319
all kinds of composite material that

2441.119 --> 2444.8
make it very light

2442.319 --> 2445.839
but unbreakable yet not uncomfortable

2444.8 --> 2448.1600000000003
and sweaty

2445.839 --> 2449.52
and yeah bring back modernized chastity

2448.16 --> 2452.16
belts

2449.52 --> 2453.04
lock and key it would be great it would

2452.16 --> 2456.0789999999997
also be great

2453.04 --> 2458.88
rape security you know

2456.079 --> 2459.2000000000003
if i if i'd be like okay i'm going to be

2458.88 --> 2461.599
all

2459.2 --> 2463.4399999999996
militant and i'm going to go against the

2461.599 --> 2466.6400000000003
blm or something you know in

2463.44 --> 2467.92
america somewhere i'd put on a freaking

2466.64 --> 2470.48
chastity belt

2467.92 --> 2472.8
and leave the key at home you know what

2470.48 --> 2472.8
i mean

2473.44 --> 2482.56
especially if you're a woman like that's

2478.16 --> 2482.56
a seriously good idea guys

2483.359 --> 2487.92
also yeah if you if you have a kid and

2486.48 --> 2490.64
your kid is getting into

2487.92 --> 2492.2400000000002
like squirt mode you got a bit of a

2490.64 --> 2494.56
problem with that

2492.24 --> 2496.16
and just taking away the internet from

2494.56 --> 2499.359
them is not helping

2496.16 --> 2501.04
then a chastity belt although yeah they

2499.359 --> 2502.319
are probably going to be so outraged

2501.04 --> 2504.16
they're going to try to burn down the

2502.319 --> 2508.319
house

2504.16 --> 2509.92
if you do that but

2508.319 --> 2513.119
i don't know i think chastity belts

2509.92 --> 2513.119
might be a great idea

2517.68 --> 2523.839
i don't have one

2525.04 --> 2529.68
right but seriously chastity belts they

2527.599 --> 2532.2400000000002
can be multi-functional

2529.68 --> 2533.52
you could use them as crotch protection

2532.24 --> 2536.4799999999996
as well

2533.52 --> 2538.48
like it's closed nobody can take it off

2536.48 --> 2540.16
and freaking rape you or something

2538.48 --> 2542.319
but hey if somebody's gonna kick you in

2540.16 --> 2543.92
the crotch then it could also be

2542.319 --> 2546.88
protection against that

2543.92 --> 2548.079
see and then suddenly a thing that seems

2546.88 --> 2552.7200000000003
kind of silly

2548.079 --> 2552.7200000000003
can have all these great functions

2552.8 --> 2555.119
huh

2556.0 --> 2559.68
i i don't know i just was thinking it's

2558.0 --> 2562.319
like chastity belt like

2559.68 --> 2564.8799999999997
yeah that seems so silly and funny and

2562.319 --> 2568.64
but maybe it's just really a good idea

2564.88 --> 2573.28
that is it's time to bring it back

2568.64 --> 2576.96
really it's not even a joke

2573.28 --> 2578.6400000000003
worst idea you ever heard no

2576.96 --> 2580.88
if you're saying it's the worst idea

2578.64 --> 2584.319
ever then you're probably a squirter

2580.88 --> 2584.319
already it's already too late

2591.359 --> 2596.56
and knowing you george sanford i'd say

2594.24 --> 2596.56
yeah

2604.839 --> 2607.839
exactly

2608.64 --> 2612.319
all right well you know what sexual

2610.4 --> 2613.839
depravity on the internet widespread

2612.319 --> 2616.64
yeah that's right

2613.839 --> 2618.56
if you're gonna have a chastity belt on

2616.64 --> 2620.319
you're just gonna click it away

2618.56 --> 2622.16
because yeah otherwise you're going to

2620.319 --> 2624.72
be stuck with a boner or something you

2622.16 --> 2626.96
can't do anything about

2624.72 --> 2628.8799999999997
because you've got a chastity belt on it

2626.96 --> 2630.16
might actually be really uncomfortable

2628.88 --> 2634.079
having a boater inside

2630.16 --> 2637.2799999999997
in in those depending on the design

2634.079 --> 2639.8390000000004
so yeah chesty belt serious it's not

2637.28 --> 2642.96
even a joke

2639.839 --> 2645.119
might actually be something to that

2642.96 --> 2647.359
because in this yeah and hey even if

2645.119 --> 2648.0
westerners or whatever if they're not

2647.359 --> 2651.119
going to do

2648.0 --> 2653.599
those two medieval you know

2651.119 --> 2655.52
i'll bet there'll be a whole bunch of

2653.599 --> 2658.56
muslims

2655.52 --> 2662.72
westernized muslims they'll think like

2658.56 --> 2665.68
yeah that's brilliant

2662.72 --> 2667.1189999999997
so yeah you're not gonna take it well

2665.68 --> 2668.8799999999997
[ __ ] you

2667.119 --> 2670.4
there's gonna be other people taking it

2668.88 --> 2671.599
and they're probably gonna have a lot of

2670.4 --> 2676.0
benefit from it

2671.599 --> 2679.44
so i say bring back chesty belts

2676.0 --> 2680.72
modernize them like really modernize

2679.44 --> 2683.92
them make them of like

2680.72 --> 2684.64
a composite plastic material that are

2683.92 --> 2688.7200000000003
super

2684.64 --> 2692.8799999999997
strong and light non-allergenic

2688.72 --> 2694.8799999999997
and yeah get this super detailed casting

2692.88 --> 2697.44
system you know you could even make

2694.88 --> 2699.119
chassis belts just custom-made

2697.44 --> 2701.599
literally like okay step into the

2699.119 --> 2702.319
scanner they literally just scan your

2701.599 --> 2705.3590000000004
ass

2702.319 --> 2707.52
literally scan your ass

2705.359 --> 2710.24
and then they can like literally cast

2707.52 --> 2712.96
mold the chesty belt to specific

2710.24 --> 2712.9599999999996
your shape

2713.599 --> 2720.56
huh wouldn't that be awesome like

2717.839 --> 2722.72
technology technologically developed

2720.56 --> 2726.4
chastity belts i think it's

2722.72 --> 2728.9599999999996
a fantastic idea really i do

2726.4 --> 2729.92
it's not a joke even though it is funny

2728.96 --> 2733.839
it's not a joke

2729.92 --> 2733.839
i think it's a great idea

2742.8 --> 2750.319
ah i'm a truly sick oh well you're truly

2746.24 --> 2750.319
banned [ __ ]

2758.56 --> 2764.0789999999997
go start well i'm not a producer

2761.599 --> 2767.04
well i'm not a this i'm not even a an

2764.079 --> 2767.04
object designer

2767.119 --> 2775.839
i would be able to find people that

2768.88 --> 2778.48
could do it

2775.839 --> 2779.44
but why would i be doing this no i think

2778.48 --> 2782.8
there's probably

2779.44 --> 2784.319
piles of people out there that could

2782.8 --> 2787.76
actually develop this

2784.319 --> 2788.079
really quickly really cheaply and just

2787.76 --> 2791.44
do

2788.079 --> 2794.5600000000004
it i don't need to be that guy that has

2791.44 --> 2797.76
all these products are mine and part of

2794.56 --> 2800.0789999999997
my industry and by my product no no

2797.76 --> 2802.079
i'll just throw the idea out there and

2800.079 --> 2805.3590000000004
then let the world produce it

2802.079 --> 2808.079
you know they need ideas they don't need

2805.359 --> 2808.0789999999997
competition

2809.76 --> 2816.0
and i got plenty of ideas right

2813.76 --> 2818.4
anyway chastity belts i thought it was

2816.0 --> 2820.24
it was actually a really good idea it

2818.4 --> 2821.76
started out as a joke even when i came

2820.24 --> 2823.359
up with it and then i just thought about

2821.76 --> 2828.7200000000003
it like holy [ __ ] that's

2823.359 --> 2828.72
actually a really great idea really good

2829.359 --> 2832.7999999999997
so many possibilities

2835.44 --> 2839.2000000000003
yeah that's really nice george sanford

2837.68 --> 2842.319
will you do that

2839.2 --> 2844.7999999999997
you know i'd be very interested in a

2842.319 --> 2848.319
chastity belt if it could protect my

2844.8 --> 2852.6400000000003
balls from radiation or my ovaries

2848.319 --> 2855.7599999999998
can protect me from potential gang rape

2852.64 --> 2858.96
not that i'm yeah seeing myself get in

2855.76 --> 2861.2000000000003
that position anytime soon or

2858.96 --> 2862.7200000000003
maybe it could even make my dick bullet

2861.2 --> 2864.5589999999997
proof

2862.72 --> 2866.48
you know if some piece of [ __ ] decides

2864.559 --> 2869.28
to shoot me in the dick well guess what

2866.48 --> 2870.72
ding yeah you ain't shooting me in the

2869.28 --> 2874.559
dick buddy

2870.72 --> 2874.5589999999997
you know all these options

2875.28 --> 2878.48
yeah ovaries i don't have ovaries that's

2877.44 --> 2880.88
right but yeah

2878.48 --> 2883.92
just the belts are definitely also for

2880.88 --> 2886.559
women probably even more than men

2883.92 --> 2888.96
but you could have a male variety

2886.559 --> 2892.2400000000002
chastity belt

2888.96 --> 2892.2400000000002
as well and a female

2899.119 --> 2903.359
right or kicking in the dick you know it

2901.92 --> 2906.7200000000003
would also protect again

2903.359 --> 2907.5989999999997
dude it's just it's just protecting your

2906.72 --> 2910.64
balls from

2907.599 --> 2915.2000000000003
every conceivable angle

2910.64 --> 2919.839
okay radiation kicks shots

2915.2 --> 2923.2799999999997
squirting protection from your own hand

2919.839 --> 2923.2799999999997
what else could you do

2926.24 --> 2930.64
this is so funny isn't it it's actually

2928.64 --> 2933.839
a good idea

2930.64 --> 2937.04
yeah yeah rest ahead exactly

2933.839 --> 2940.48
there you got another function c bring

2937.04 --> 2941.839
back the chastity belt make it super

2940.48 --> 2945.04
high-tech

2941.839 --> 2946.64
develop modernized materials

2945.04 --> 2948.88
you could mass produce it it would

2946.64 --> 2954.0
probably be pretty easy to do

2948.88 --> 2954.0
it's like a mini body armor thing

2954.24 --> 2957.839
but only a small part

2960.72 --> 2964.3999999999996
you know make it of the freaking spider

2963.44 --> 2966.559
goats

2964.4 --> 2968.7200000000003
or whatever you know make it a freaking

2966.559 --> 2972.0
spider goat material

2968.72 --> 2975.2
whatever that is so it's literally just

2972.0 --> 2977.839
bulletproof you put some

2975.2 --> 2978.7999999999997
stuff in there so it's radiation i don't

2977.839 --> 2982.7999999999997
know man

2978.8 --> 2986.4
that should be doable

2982.8 --> 2986.4
the crotch that strikes back

2987.839 --> 2992.5589999999997
yeah well you would you lock it well of

2991.04 --> 2993.44
course that's going to be the option

2992.559 --> 2995.44
isn't it

2993.44 --> 2998.2400000000002
there should be a lock system on there

2995.44 --> 3001.599
as well but it doesn't have to be

2998.24 --> 3001.5989999999997
locked necessarily

3005.44 --> 3010.2400000000002
look i'm sure that such a product would

3007.68 --> 3014.319
be wildly popular in the s

3010.24 --> 3019.04
m sector you know of course

3014.319 --> 3022.0
of course it's just gonna be more

3019.04 --> 3023.44
yeah it's just gonna be a good product

3022.0 --> 3026.72
that's why i said

3023.44 --> 3028.7200000000003
bring back the the modernized version of

3026.72 --> 3031.7599999999998
a chastity belt

3028.72 --> 3035.52
it may be a lot more useful

3031.76 --> 3038.7200000000003
than you might think right so

3035.52 --> 3040.319
there's that oh yeah and i watched a

3038.72 --> 3043.04
bunch of movies and i'll round out with

3040.319 --> 3045.599
that because it's like four minutes left

3043.04 --> 3047.2
but i watched mission impossible rogue

3045.599 --> 3049.28
nation i haven't watched that before i

3047.2 --> 3052.319
think it's the latest one

3049.28 --> 3052.3190000000004
it's just the latest

3052.4 --> 3055.6800000000003
banker propaganda movie about their

3054.96 --> 3058.96
secret

3055.68 --> 3062.0
service from the irf

3058.96 --> 3064.7200000000003
but yeah that part was really annoying

3062.0 --> 3065.76
the action part though pretty damn

3064.72 --> 3067.359
awesome

3065.76 --> 3069.8390000000004
as an action movie i thought it was

3067.359 --> 3073.119
really kick-ass

3069.839 --> 3075.92
it was very typical maybe maybe

3073.119 --> 3076.88
it's even getting a little bit too

3075.92 --> 3079.92
formulaic

3076.88 --> 3081.839
in ways but i still thought that yeah mr

3079.92 --> 3084.16
impossible rogue nation was a pretty

3081.839 --> 3084.96
interesting and amusing movie to watch

3084.16 --> 3087.359
with a lot of

3084.96 --> 3088.16
awesome looking scenes and [ __ ] oh yeah

3087.359 --> 3090.48
and after that

3088.16 --> 3091.5989999999997
i watched a little bit more ridiculous

3090.48 --> 3093.92
silly

3091.599 --> 3096.8
or yeah a movie that i've never even

3093.92 --> 3100.2400000000002
heard of before

3096.8 --> 3105.8390000000004
it was yeah called primal

3100.24 --> 3105.839
uh with one of my favorite weird actors

3106.96 --> 3114.459
how can i forget his name is terrible

3110.22 --> 3114.459
[Music]

3116.24 --> 3127.2
let me just look oh yeah it's 2009

3125.2 --> 3129.839
wow that's a really recent movie i

3127.2 --> 3133.04
didn't even know yeah nicholas cage

3129.839 --> 3136.48
oh i thought he was awesome

3133.04 --> 3138.64
in that movie his role was like

3136.48 --> 3140.72
it's almost like he reinvented sort of

3138.64 --> 3142.5589999999997
an indiana jones

3140.72 --> 3144.24
a little bit more realistic and he was

3142.559 --> 3148.2400000000002
like an animal

3144.24 --> 3150.4799999999996
trapper and smuggler

3148.24 --> 3152.0
but it's not really the movie was about

3150.48 --> 3155.52
a giant hostage situation

3152.0 --> 3157.599
on the boat with like a real [ __ ] up

3155.52 --> 3161.28
psychopath and like he was

3157.599 --> 3163.04
genuinely terrifying he played that role

3161.28 --> 3166.6400000000003
really well so i thought i was pretty

3163.04 --> 3168.88
impressed by this movie didn't expect

3166.64 --> 3168.8799999999997
that

3171.599 --> 3175.04
also yeah like he didn't have any yet he

3174.559 --> 3178.96
was

3175.04 --> 3181.599
at one point he's like

3178.96 --> 3183.92
the character was very much into

3181.599 --> 3185.6800000000003
pragmatism and at some point like

3183.92 --> 3187.599
they had to like okay we're just gonna

3185.68 --> 3189.2
abandon this guy that's poison because

3187.599 --> 3191.52
we can't do anything about it

3189.2 --> 3192.7999999999997
sorry about your dad but we gotta go and

3191.52 --> 3195.04
then later like oh

3192.8 --> 3197.119
he survived it he was like oh thank you

3195.04 --> 3200.16
so much for saving me and he's like

3197.119 --> 3203.119
no no sorry but we actually abandoned

3200.16 --> 3205.1189999999997
you but i'm really glad you're all right

3203.119 --> 3208.0
so he was at least honest he wasn't

3205.119 --> 3211.04
trying to be like oh i'm a hero when

3208.0 --> 3212.079
he's just a pragmatic guy and i like

3211.04 --> 3215.2799999999997
that

3212.079 --> 3219.52
little details in this movie

3215.28 --> 3222.48
yeah movies and time are mind wasters

3219.52 --> 3223.2
movies and time you mean movies are

3222.48 --> 3225.28
right time

3223.2 --> 3227.9199999999996
and mind wasters except when they're

3225.28 --> 3227.92
really good

3228.64 --> 3236.0789999999997
and amusing they can also be just

3232.48 --> 3237.2
drag you out of a slum they can do that

3236.079 --> 3239.6800000000003
too if they're good

3237.2 --> 3242.16
if it's the right time for it so i know

3239.68 --> 3246.319
i thought that primal was an interesting

3242.16 --> 3246.319
movie and i actually recommend watching

3248.839 --> 3252.7999999999997
that

3250.24 --> 3253.9199999999996
yeah jd that's really nice yeah yeah

3252.8 --> 3256.319
yeah

3253.92 --> 3258.079
of course and hand over your guns so

3256.319 --> 3259.52
they will decide who's going to be

3258.079 --> 3262.1600000000003
killed by guns

3259.52 --> 3263.599
yeah i know the government is [ __ ]

3262.16 --> 3265.44
anything you give the government

3263.599 --> 3266.96
it's going to turn it into hell it

3265.44 --> 3269.52
doesn't matter what it is

3266.96 --> 3270.16
that's always what's going to happen any

3269.52 --> 3272.48
device

3270.16 --> 3274.24
any device hand it over to the

3272.48 --> 3275.76
government and they're going to turn it
