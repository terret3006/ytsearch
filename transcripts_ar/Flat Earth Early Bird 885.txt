just like yesterday by the way but

136.4 --> 141.04
just watching a video

141.52 --> 149.76000000000002
a sort of a fanfic video

144.72 --> 152.8
of a reimagining of the star wars

149.76 --> 156.07999999999998
sequels and yeah

152.8 --> 158.64000000000001
it was very impressive put the link in

156.08 --> 162.239
the skype

158.64 --> 165.83999999999997
so of the group of movie reviewers

162.239 --> 168.31900000000002
made it together and it's it's really

165.84 --> 171.599
compelling

168.319 --> 174.23899999999998
uh hey hello samson first in chat

171.599 --> 174.23899999999998
good to see you

175.84 --> 182.4
so yeah i'm a little filled up with that

180.0 --> 183.44
right now makes me want to watch the

182.4 --> 186.31900000000002
star wars

183.44 --> 186.319
sequels again

188.239 --> 192.56
although they're not going to be as good

189.84 --> 195.599
as well

192.56 --> 197.12
how the how this fan scription as it's

195.599 --> 200.23899999999998
called

197.12 --> 203.28
was set up it was really compelling very

200.239 --> 203.28
fascinating stuff

208.0 --> 215.76
right so

213.36 --> 227.84
how's everybody doing this thursday

215.76 --> 227.84
morning or afternoon

228.72 --> 234.4
right so yeah yesterday's early bird

232.879 --> 238.56
show

234.4 --> 242.31900000000002
was really good and i'm very happy about

238.56 --> 245.68
how it unrolled the entire thing

242.319 --> 248.72
i watched it all back i kind of ended my

245.68 --> 248.72
day yesterday on that

250.48 --> 258.32
it was interesting i watched it i'm good

254.08 --> 258.32
what was interesting samson

259.919 --> 262.799
yesterday's show

264.639 --> 269.04
because the video i pretty much just

267.28 --> 271.19899999999996
posted it in skype so you couldn't have

269.04 --> 273.28000000000003
watched it

271.199 --> 275.12
because it is like 40 minutes long or

273.28 --> 278.32
something so

275.12 --> 278.8
but yeah definitely if you have any kind

278.32 --> 282.0
of

278.8 --> 284.96000000000004
care for star wars then yeah i

282.0 --> 286.8
recommend watching that it it's it has

284.96 --> 290.32
some really good ideas

286.8 --> 294.24
it almost makes me wish like ah

290.32 --> 296.4
they could somehow like maybe remake the

294.24 --> 298.96000000000004
movies yeah

296.4 --> 300.63899999999995
right like the big movie companies are

298.96 --> 303.28
gonna do that

300.639 --> 305.199
but man it would be worth it it would

303.28 --> 309.35999999999996
very much be worth it

305.199 --> 311.68
to to try and make another version of it

309.36 --> 314.32
like they could do it it would

311.68 --> 317.36
absolutely make

314.32 --> 325.039
some really good

317.36 --> 327.52000000000004
alternative versions of it

325.039 --> 327.52
we'll see

328.8 --> 332.479
you'd have to watch that uh

333.28 --> 339.039
that video to to understand like yeah

336.96 --> 340.79999999999995
they could do that it would be very much

339.039 --> 342.71999999999997
worth it

340.8 --> 344.56
they have to scrap a whole bunch of

342.72 --> 347.44000000000005
scenes

344.56 --> 347.44
and redo them

350.479 --> 357.36
and add on a whole bunch of other things

353.759 --> 360.88
but yeah it would be worth it i think

357.36 --> 362.72
it would make the the sequels very

360.88 --> 364.15999999999997
much more compelling than they are

362.72 --> 366.56
currently

364.16 --> 369.84000000000003
because yeah i think that most star wars

366.56 --> 369.84
fans even agree that

370.4 --> 375.52
it wasn't as good as as it could have

373.28 --> 375.52
been

376.96 --> 381.84
right anyway

384.24 --> 397.28000000000003
helicopter coming over

394.8 --> 397.28000000000003
anyway

398.24 --> 401.6
uh yeah flat earth debate yesterday was

400.479 --> 404.4

411.68 --> 416.08
it was a good show and a good after show

413.68 --> 420.479
and it was part of

416.08 --> 420.479
most of it no i was part of all of it

421.52 --> 426.08
and then eventually did my newspaper

423.68 --> 426.08

498.879 --> 502.879

695.76 --> 701.68
put it back exactly as in the other

698.8 --> 703.76
type of slide if you accidentally moved

701.68 --> 708.0

1080.32 --> 1084.1599999999999
would

1080.64 --> 1087.679
like to ask you to refrain

1084.16 --> 1090.0
from doing that unless they

1087.679 --> 1092.64
like really say something that would

1090.0 --> 1092.64
warrant that

1092.84 --> 1095.84
tony

1114.559 --> 1120.6399999999999

1127.55 --> 1130.619
[Music]

1133.679 --> 1137.8400000000001
yeah well look

1139.919 --> 1144.24
just i get it i you were trying to be

1143.2 --> 1147.28
chivalrous

1144.24 --> 1151.679
i appreciate that in a way but yeah this

1147.28 --> 1155.76
this chat is is also meant for

1151.679 --> 1155.76
globbers right

1155.919 --> 1159.76
it's not just flat earthers exclusively

1158.799 --> 1161.6
and pat fee

1159.76 --> 1165.6
yeah he can be a bit trollish but he

1161.6 --> 1169.52
does have some input

1165.6 --> 1173.1999999999998
and he has managed

1169.52 --> 1173.9189999999999
to stay halfway civil at times and when

1173.2 --> 1176.48
he

1173.919 --> 1177.44
oversteps that bound then i do time him

1176.48 --> 1180.24
out too and if he

1177.44 --> 1183.76
really goes too far i will ban him right

1180.24 --> 1183.76
you're not still timed out

1185.76 --> 1191.44
what is my position on global trolls

1188.96 --> 1192.16
well global trolls are global trolls it

1191.44 --> 1195.679
all depends

1192.16 --> 1197.3600000000001
on how rigid they're gonna be

1195.679 --> 1199.679
with what they do if they're only

1197.36 --> 1200.799
focused on psychological warfare or if

1199.679 --> 1203.6000000000001
they're just there

1200.799 --> 1207.44
for an interesting conversation and to

1203.6 --> 1221.6
give their input

1207.44 --> 1225.2
sun and moon re creeping what

1221.6 --> 1228.0
tying them out for being a weasel

1225.2 --> 1228.0
that's all right

1230.48 --> 1235.84
no pet fee

1245.44 --> 1249.1200000000001
right anyway i'm up for conversation

1248.0 --> 1263.84
subjects

1249.12 --> 1263.84
whatever you bring up

1296.24 --> 1305.84
too hot

1320.24 --> 1326.32
all right all right it's okay it's okay

1326.72 --> 1336.4
emf shielding

1333.28 --> 1336.3999999999999
yeah okay

1342.72 --> 1350.32
i don't really know too much about

1346.96 --> 1352.64
emf shielding i think that

1350.32 --> 1354.6399999999999
in my position it's very tough to

1352.64 --> 1356.64
accomplish something like that

1354.64 --> 1358.96
when i'm basically in a building

1356.64 --> 1360.96
surrounded by people that

1358.96 --> 1362.08
live on their mobile phones with

1360.96 --> 1365.52
internet

1362.08 --> 1368.799
all the time and a lot of wi-fi

1365.52 --> 1368.799
routers everywhere

1369.679 --> 1373.6000000000001
so my objective to deal with it has

1372.72 --> 1377.3600000000001
always been

1373.6 --> 1381.039
ensure you don't have any

1377.36 --> 1386.7199999999998
wi-fi sources close to you just to stay

1381.039 --> 1389.919
have the best possible distance

1386.72 --> 1392.0
to wherever you know routers are sending

1389.919 --> 1395.679
out wi-fi

1392.0 --> 1395.679
and yeah that's the best i can do

1396.24 --> 1400.84
i can't really isolate myself from emf

1398.96 --> 1403.8400000000001
here in this building it's just not

1400.84 --> 1403.84
possible

1417.2 --> 1422.32
looking into canopies of silver and

1419.84 --> 1426.8799999999999
copper mesh

1422.32 --> 1428.84
to sleep under well the thing is

1426.88 --> 1430.64
if you're gonna have some kind of

1428.84 --> 1434.72
insulator

1430.64 --> 1438.64
right the problem with insulators is

1434.72 --> 1442.159
they effectively can insulate

1438.64 --> 1445.44
but they can also turn into

1442.159 --> 1448.24
well antennas right so it's

1445.44 --> 1448.24
it's difficult

1448.799 --> 1453.12
it's not so easy to create an isolation

1452.24 --> 1456.88
from emf

1453.12 --> 1459.12
because the materials that isolate

1456.88 --> 1460.96
can also actually function as an

1459.12 --> 1464.7199999999998
amplifier in a way

1460.96 --> 1464.72
as an antenna so yeah

1465.679 --> 1469.679
there are people that have that if like

1468.64 --> 1472.64
are professional

1469.679 --> 1473.919
experts in how to do it properly that if

1472.64 --> 1478.48
the machines

1473.919 --> 1480.4
that test it all and

1478.48 --> 1483.2
yeah i've known that for quite a while

1480.4 --> 1485.1200000000001
like if you have the money

1483.2 --> 1486.48
it shouldn't be that expensive you can

1485.12 --> 1490.3999999999999
basically

1486.48 --> 1491.76
contact them and get whatever situation

1490.4 --> 1494.799
you want

1491.76 --> 1497.039
emf free or as much as possible free

1494.799 --> 1499.6
you can basically hire them to figure

1497.039 --> 1503.039
out how to do it in that location and

1499.6 --> 1503.039
get it worked out and tested

1508.48 --> 1511.6
silver hat

1527.84 --> 1532.799
good to know right but i think one of

1530.64 --> 1533.44
the best advices i can give concerning

1532.799 --> 1535.9189999999999
emf

1533.44 --> 1537.8400000000001
is to have your mobile phone if you have

1535.919 --> 1543.039
a typical

1537.84 --> 1546.24
internet based phone and all that to

1543.039 --> 1548.8799999999999
put it into a blockade pocket type setup

1546.24 --> 1548.88
a good one

1549.6 --> 1553.279
that actually completely isolates it so

1552.08 --> 1554.96
the only thing that

1553.279 --> 1558.08
that the alarm clock or whatever you're

1554.96 --> 1559.919
going to use it at will still function

1558.08 --> 1561.84
but that there's no other type of

1559.919 --> 1564.3200000000002
contact

1561.84 --> 1566.1589999999999
and that way if you have a mobile phone

1564.32 --> 1568.559
and you use it as an alarm clock and you

1566.159 --> 1572.3200000000002
have it basically right next to your bed

1568.559 --> 1575.44
that way it's not going to send its emf

1572.32 --> 1578.559
through you during the night

1575.44 --> 1579.8400000000001
i think that is a basic tip that could

1578.559 --> 1581.84
help someone

1579.84 --> 1583.279
because yeah most people do have a

1581.84 --> 1586.6399999999999
regular

1583.279 --> 1588.48
high-end internet phone on which they do

1586.64 --> 1590.72
everything and they keep it close by you

1588.48 --> 1592.64
don't like oh let's put it

1590.72 --> 1594.32
in the other room while going to bed

1592.64 --> 1596.3200000000002
there's very little people that actually

1594.32 --> 1599.2
do that

1596.32 --> 1600.96
so you're gonna have it as a i emf

1599.2 --> 1604.0800000000002
source

1600.96 --> 1607.279
even while you're sleeping and to

1604.08 --> 1609.6789999999999
bypass that influence get a blocked

1607.279 --> 1609.679
pocket

1609.84 --> 1613.4399999999998
and then put it in there in the night so

1612.159 --> 1616.72
that there's no emf

1613.44 --> 1618.48
coming from it while you're sleeping

1616.72 --> 1620.32
how about getting an alarm clock well

1618.48 --> 1623.44
yeah if you want to do that

1620.32 --> 1625.84
you know but i

1623.44 --> 1628.48
myself even use my basic phone which

1625.84 --> 1631.52
doesn't have internet it's only

1628.48 --> 1636.88
telephone i even use it

1631.52 --> 1636.8799999999999
as an alarm clock because it is easy and

1638.84 --> 1655.84
convenient

1640.72 --> 1655.84
emf clothing what's this

1657.52 --> 1659.84
uh

1662.0 --> 1669.84
okay i don't know about that

1674.799 --> 1679.12
i i could work perhaps

1681.44 --> 1686.24
but yeah from what i'm see i'm not gonna

1683.44 --> 1686.24
wear that stuff

1687.279 --> 1705.14
to each their own

1696.83 --> 1705.1399999999999
[Music]

1705.76 --> 1710.48
right maybe if you have a job where

1708.399 --> 1712.0
you're typically going to be in a place

1710.48 --> 1715.44
where you're constantly getting

1712.0 --> 1719.52
bombarded by all kinds of emf then maybe

1715.44 --> 1723.1200000000001
faraday clove could could be helpful

1719.52 --> 1725.12
like to protect your genitals or

1723.12 --> 1726.399
yeah because that can be influenced in

1725.12 --> 1728.08
the long run

1726.399 --> 1729.4399999999998
especially if you're really bathing

1728.08 --> 1732.559
thickly

1729.44 --> 1733.039
or like for your chest so you don't get

1732.559 --> 1736.72
any

1733.039 --> 1739.44
heart rhythm situations

1736.72 --> 1741.1200000000001
which can also come from heavy emf

1739.44 --> 1745.039
influence

1741.12 --> 1747.279
right so that could work

1745.039 --> 1749.12
for at your workplace if it is a

1747.279 --> 1752.159
workplace where you are absolutely

1749.12 --> 1755.279
guaranteed to be bathing in emf

1752.159 --> 1758.3200000000002
then maybe yeah some of these insulating

1755.279 --> 1758.32
clothes could help

1759.36 --> 1767.84
wear a metal nut cap hey

1768.559 --> 1773.2
yeah well sleeping word have you ever

1770.32 --> 1778.08
considered that maybe

1773.2 --> 1783.1200000000001
tin foil hat is a controlled opposition

1778.08 --> 1786.72
ridicule because it actually works

1783.12 --> 1789.039
it just it was forwarded as like oh

1786.72 --> 1791.279
you have to put it on to prevent mind

1789.039 --> 1794.24
control somebody telepathically

1791.279 --> 1796.159
doing things with your head right well

1794.24 --> 1798.159
that seemed like a naughty controlled

1796.159 --> 1801.279
opposition story

1798.159 --> 1804.3990000000001
to basically ridicule it

1801.279 --> 1808.159
when it actually does work

1804.399 --> 1812.1589999999999
with things it may actually

1808.159 --> 1812.159
blot uh block out emf

1813.039 --> 1816.559
reverse psychology well that's what they

1814.96 --> 1818.96
do that's what they do with

1816.559 --> 1819.76
everything they take something that's

1818.96 --> 1822.72
real

1819.76 --> 1825.679
that's like way outside of the normal

1822.72 --> 1828.0
train of thought from regular people

1825.679 --> 1830.0
and then they ridicule it make it into

1828.0 --> 1832.24
something really nutty and conspiracy

1830.0 --> 1833.039
theory so that everybody associates it

1832.24 --> 1835.36
with something

1833.039 --> 1836.48
that is stupid they did the same thing

1835.36 --> 1838.1589999999999
with bigfoot

1836.48 --> 1840.96
right now whether you think bigfoot is

1838.159 --> 1844.159
actually a real thing or not

1840.96 --> 1847.8400000000001
they forwarded the concept as

1844.159 --> 1849.6000000000001
a naughty to be ridiculed concept

1847.84 --> 1851.1999999999998
conspiou what are you a big food

1849.6 --> 1854.6399999999999
believer they

1851.2 --> 1857.3600000000001
created that that response

1854.64 --> 1860.159
with what they've done with it right and

1857.36 --> 1863.9189999999999
the same goes for tinfoil hat

1860.159 --> 1866.159
and the same goes for snake oil salesmen

1863.919 --> 1868.48
remember that saying snake oil salesman

1866.159 --> 1870.7990000000002
everybody knows what that means

1868.48 --> 1871.679
what you don't learn however is that

1870.799 --> 1875.2
snake oil

1871.679 --> 1877.76
actually works they don't

1875.2 --> 1878.24
tell you that right now it doesn't work

1877.76 --> 1881.2
for

1878.24 --> 1883.039
everything but it works for some things

1881.2 --> 1887.1200000000001
they don't tell you that

1883.039 --> 1890.96
no it was a controlled opposition

1887.12 --> 1892.0
ridicule placement piece of culture they

1890.96 --> 1894.559
created for people

1892.0 --> 1895.519
to latch on so they would never really

1894.559 --> 1897.279
look into it

1895.519 --> 1899.6
neutrally and find out hey there's

1897.279 --> 1901.679
actually something to this

1899.6 --> 1904.0
because i might get ridiculed because

1901.679 --> 1905.76
the ridicule culture is going around

1904.0 --> 1907.039
everybody ridicules it so i'm not going

1905.76 --> 1909.36
to look into it

1907.039 --> 1909.36
right

1918.88 --> 1922.96
a jared mathers ogre

1932.84 --> 1935.84
hmm

1940.399 --> 1944.8799999999999
right yeah take what's real then market

1942.799 --> 1945.279
but it's especially take something

1944.88 --> 1948.88
that's

1945.279 --> 1952.32
real and the head of development

1948.88 --> 1955.0390000000002
ahead of obviously becoming a key factor

1952.32 --> 1955.9189999999999
to be taken into account with the world

1955.039 --> 1958.64
what's going on

1955.919 --> 1960.88
the technology the developments right it

1958.64 --> 1964.72
takes something in early insight

1960.88 --> 1967.519
an early warning then they ridicule it

1964.72 --> 1968.48
they make it into part of the ridicule

1967.519 --> 1970.559
culture

1968.48 --> 1974.88
silly people and their silly conspiracy

1970.559 --> 1974.8799999999999
theories and their paranoia and all that

1975.2 --> 1978.48
to prevent people from actually looking

1977.6 --> 1981.6
into what

1978.48 --> 1984.08
those people those original ones has

1981.6 --> 1984.9599999999998
actually brought it forth to warn people

1984.08 --> 1987.9189999999999
with

1984.96 --> 1987.919
right that's the trick

1989.6 --> 1993.6789999999999
it's like psychological inoculation

1992.399 --> 2005.84
against

1993.679 --> 2005.8400000000001
relevant information

2007.44 --> 2010.88
any thoughts on globes cameras reds and

2009.919 --> 2015.2
fight the flare

2010.88 --> 2019.8400000000001
not really they're scammers

2015.2 --> 2019.8400000000001
they are mega gammas

2023.039 --> 2033.84
what's this article snake oil

2027.039 --> 2033.84
salesman we're on to something

2044.84 --> 2047.84
huh

2048.0 --> 2061.839
wow it's a snake oil related

2051.04 --> 2061.839
article fascinating

2063.359 --> 2075.839
looks like the halfway decent article

2065.599 --> 2075.839
thanks for the link

2092.48 --> 2097.68
but it always stuck to me that like the

2094.879 --> 2100.64
idea of snake oil salesman

2097.68 --> 2102.3199999999997
is a shield is a fake salesman right

2100.64 --> 2104.7999999999997
selling you garbage

2102.32 --> 2107.3590000000004
that's like a cultural trope that's

2104.8 --> 2109.92
lasted for a very long time and

2107.359 --> 2111.839
100 percent guaranteed promoted by the

2109.92 --> 2116.2400000000002
medical industrial complex

2111.839 --> 2119.599
100 guaranteed they they did that

2116.24 --> 2121.1189999999997
because those snake oil salesmen at the

2119.599 --> 2124.0
time when they were

2121.119 --> 2124.88
like getting around they were the

2124.0 --> 2127.28
competition

2124.88 --> 2128.6400000000003
to the new medical system to the

2127.28 --> 2132.0
allopathic

2128.64 --> 2135.1189999999997
red cross based rockefeller founded

2132.0 --> 2138.24
medical system as it was about to unroll

2135.119 --> 2140.6400000000003
and take over the western world

2138.24 --> 2142.3999999999996
right they were the competition so yeah

2140.64 --> 2145.44
they are the batman they

2142.4 --> 2148.2400000000002
are the snake oil salesman they say cute

2145.44 --> 2148.8
so you fake things that aren't science

2148.24 --> 2151.839
right

2148.8 --> 2151.8390000000004
that's what they said

2152.0 --> 2157.52
it's very ironic that yeah there is

2154.88 --> 2161.44
something to snake oil

2157.52 --> 2164.079
it's just yeah you got to be informed

2161.44 --> 2173.359
it's not a cure all but it does help

2164.079 --> 2176.5600000000004
with some things

2173.359 --> 2176.56
okay pam cowell

2176.8 --> 2180.0
century snake oil salesman did not in

2179.119 --> 2183.44
fact

2180.0 --> 2185.359
sell this particular product

2183.44 --> 2188.0
well from what i remember is that there

2185.359 --> 2190.72
were like scammers going around selling

2188.0 --> 2194.0
cures and they would like take

2190.72 --> 2196.0
goat droppings powder it up and then say

2194.0 --> 2197.839
that it was a special cure

2196.0 --> 2199.44
that sort of thing right well i would

2197.839 --> 2202.48
that's

2199.44 --> 2204.079
the actual scam right it's basically

2202.48 --> 2208.32
take this

2204.079 --> 2211.44
whatever it is although those people

2208.32 --> 2211.44
mostly rested on

2212.32 --> 2219.2000000000003
the gullibility and psychosimatics

2216.16 --> 2220.64
very important people believing it will

2219.2 --> 2224.96
help cure things it's

2220.64 --> 2228.16
it's unique to that entire field

2224.96 --> 2230.079
the psychosomatics matter a lot right

2228.16 --> 2233.2
but the actual snail

2230.079 --> 2234.48
snake oil itself as a product yeah that

2233.2 --> 2243.839
worked

2234.48 --> 2243.839
it still does

2252.4 --> 2257.839
what are you blabbering about jared

2254.4 --> 2257.839
mathers og

2269.04 --> 2285.839
right pam kyle interesting

2296.839 --> 2299.839
what

2306.079 --> 2313.2000000000003
hmm right well jared

2309.2 --> 2315.68
madler mathers oh gee

2313.2 --> 2316.96
if tony is going to voice change

2315.68 --> 2319.52
somebody else

2316.96 --> 2321.119
he's obviously doing it to prevent

2319.52 --> 2326.0
getting struck

2321.119 --> 2329.44
getting copyright struck right all that

2326.0 --> 2332.56
i take it it's still plenty obvious who

2329.44 --> 2335.68
he was referencing right

2332.56 --> 2340.4
call them out by name then how is

2335.68 --> 2343.5989999999997
applying a voice changer

2340.4 --> 2355.839
how is that being a weasel you explain

2343.599 --> 2355.839
that to me

2355.92 --> 2359.839
while sleeping warrior he basically said

2357.92 --> 2361.839
in there like oh you are the weasel

2359.839 --> 2363.2799999999997
because you applied a voice changer to

2361.839 --> 2366.4
somebody else

2363.28 --> 2368.2400000000002
that you used their material on your

2366.4 --> 2369.6800000000003
stream i don't see that i don't

2368.24 --> 2372.56
understand how you're supposed to be a

2369.68 --> 2372.56
weasel because of that

2374.56 --> 2378.48
fight the flat earth losing all his

2376.24 --> 2381.1189999999997
support

2378.48 --> 2381.52
seems sleeping wants to help what the

2381.119 --> 2384.8
hell

2381.52 --> 2384.8
are you blabbering about

2393.52 --> 2397.119
why is he trying what are you blabbering

2396.4 --> 2399.52
about

2397.119 --> 2402.079
tony are you trying to save fight the

2399.52 --> 2402.079
flat earth

2407.52 --> 2414.24
he was on fight the show voice changer

2411.92 --> 2414.2400000000002
what

2423.52 --> 2427.28
hello bill g yeah

2427.68 --> 2432.64
losing his support means his girl broke

2434.319 --> 2438.0
uh all his fans know he's a scammer you

2437.44 --> 2441.68
mean fight

2438.0 --> 2453.839
the flat earth yeah probably they should

2441.68 --> 2453.839
they should know

2464.839 --> 2470.0
hmm

2466.079 --> 2471.52
so the globe debunkers two big guys are

2470.0 --> 2473.92
going to take a beacon

2471.52 --> 2476.079
oh we're gonna stick such a big hit

2473.92 --> 2479.119
jared oh my god

2476.079 --> 2482.6400000000003
oh we're almost defeated aren't we tony

2479.119 --> 2485.119
aren't we we're almost defeated because

2482.64 --> 2486.72
the ballers refuse to accept that every

2485.119 --> 2488.56
time they bring forth some kind of

2486.72 --> 2489.2799999999997
picture to prove that there is earth

2488.56 --> 2492.0
curve

2489.28 --> 2492.6400000000003
that when we try to test them on it it

2492.0 --> 2494.48
turns out

2492.64 --> 2496.56
they don't actually have a claim of

2494.48 --> 2500.2400000000002
earth curve they just get really

2496.56 --> 2502.319
messed up and confused start caught

2500.24 --> 2503.4399999999996
yeah demanding we exclude certain

2502.319 --> 2506.56
details from

2503.44 --> 2508.8
the approach and then just claim it

2506.56 --> 2511.7599999999998
is earth curve proof even though it's a

2508.8 --> 2514.8
blatant black swan where

2511.76 --> 2517.119
we're going down man it's like

2514.8 --> 2519.2000000000003
the the globe is totally winning because

2517.119 --> 2522.96
they are ignoring

2519.2 --> 2527.5989999999997
that they're not winning

2522.96 --> 2527.599
and repentant in their faith yeah

2532.64 --> 2537.839
oh okay

2543.92 --> 2546.2400000000002
right

2547.599 --> 2552.7200000000003
i agree to that jared matters i've seen

2550.48 --> 2565.839
videos of him before he got

2552.72 --> 2565.839
to globe defender before he became that

2566.16 --> 2571.68
voice changers for all

2569.2 --> 2572.3999999999996
on nathan's show what what do you mean

2571.68 --> 2579.839
jared

2572.4 --> 2579.839
i mean uh ralph rodriguez

2583.359 --> 2595.44
is ftm what are you talking about

2592.88 --> 2597.28
you really think sleeping warrior would

2595.44 --> 2600.079
come on

2597.28 --> 2600.48
to fight the flat earth show using a

2600.079 --> 2606.7200000000003
voice

2600.48 --> 2620.72
changer why would he do that that's

2606.72 --> 2624.72
really silly

2620.72 --> 2624.72
i don't know what an ftm means by the

2632.839 --> 2635.92
way

2634.24 --> 2638.0789999999997
right there's no real benefit of going

2635.92 --> 2639.359
on this you're probably not even going

2638.079 --> 2641.76
to be speaking you're just

2639.359 --> 2642.4
like oh you're the flat earther that's

2641.76 --> 2645.0400000000004
finally

2642.4 --> 2645.76
brave enough to face us and sit in the

2645.04 --> 2648.72
corner and

2645.76 --> 2649.76
shut up while we gush non-stop about how

2648.72 --> 2651.5989999999997
you're stupid

2649.76 --> 2653.3590000000004
and about how all the flat earthers are

2651.599 --> 2655.04
wrong and we just don't understand

2653.359 --> 2656.64
and as soon as you try to speak up

2655.04 --> 2658.64
against it they're just going to loudly

2656.64 --> 2658.96
ramp us all over you so nobody can hear

2658.64 --> 2662.0789999999997
you

2658.96 --> 2665.119
yes must be great opportunity to

2662.079 --> 2668.48
get on the fight the flat earth show

2665.119 --> 2668.48
it's totally worth it man

2671.44 --> 2675.52
another guy still thinks gravity is yeah

2673.44 --> 2676.0
but he's given permission to think

2675.52 --> 2678.319
gravity

2676.0 --> 2679.92
is a force why are you being so hard on

2678.319 --> 2682.48
him he's got permission

2679.92 --> 2684.56
he's got a special exemption he can

2682.48 --> 2687.68
think gravity is a force

2684.56 --> 2691.839
it was told to him so

2687.68 --> 2691.839
give him a break man

2701.839 --> 2706.96
right we got it on camera on camera he's

2705.119 --> 2719.839
been given permission to think

2706.96 --> 2719.839
gravity is a force so what's the problem

2725.119 --> 2732.4
okay well in that case

2729.52 --> 2747.839
stop wasting my time and stop filling my

2732.4 --> 2747.839
chat with garbage

2750.24 --> 2754.16
yeah it is dumb tom parker i agree

2755.04 --> 2759.2
is it possible this chat could get more

2757.52 --> 2775.839
childish

2759.2 --> 2775.839
it could if i allow it to

2781.2 --> 2785.04
ah but now you also see the contrast the

2783.359 --> 2787.2799999999997
pad fee

2785.04 --> 2790.8
is not really that much of a troll he's

2787.28 --> 2790.8
not doing this sort of nonsense

2791.599 --> 2795.6800000000003
right and that's why i haven't really

2793.119 --> 2795.6800000000003
banned him

2800.4 --> 2803.839
hey agm

2808.0 --> 2814.24
start talking about evidence for gravity

2811.76 --> 2816.0
well before you before you claim

2814.24 --> 2817.839
evidence for gravity first you gotta

2816.0 --> 2822.24
define

2817.839 --> 2825.599
what it is in order to well to claim

2822.24 --> 2826.56
how you have evidence for it right i did

2825.599 --> 2829.6800000000003
my best on the

2826.56 --> 2830.0
flat earth debate yesterday i thought i

2829.68 --> 2831.44
did

2830.0 --> 2833.2
i thought i did a really great

2831.44 --> 2837.68
representation

2833.2 --> 2840.72
with the necessary double think

2837.68 --> 2842.24
quickly move on process as part of it

2840.72 --> 2845.1189999999997
because yeah it is necessary

2842.24 --> 2846.8799999999997
like as soon as you're gonna use gravity

2845.119 --> 2849.28
gravity as a cornerstone

2846.88 --> 2851.599
you're going to have a fundamental

2849.28 --> 2854.3190000000004
problem

2851.599 --> 2856.48
but yeah you can try to bypass that with

2854.319 --> 2858.48
just a little trickery patchwork

2856.48 --> 2861.44
it's not that tough you don't have to go

2858.48 --> 2873.839
all nasty as a glober to do that

2861.44 --> 2873.839
but yeah a little trickery is inevitable

2883.92 --> 2887.52
right i think there's more to the theory

2887.119 --> 2890.7200000000003
that

2887.52 --> 2895.839
mask attracting mask

2890.72 --> 2895.839
is a thing more than mass attracting

2898.839 --> 2901.839
mass

2907.28 --> 2911.52
the shot of snake blood ew

2911.599 --> 2918.079
ew oh that's not the same thing as snake

2915.52 --> 2921.04
oil snake oil actually involves

2918.079 --> 2921.04
snake poison

2921.359 --> 2926.4
it's blood no no

2927.359 --> 2943.839
that's just ill

2930.64 --> 2943.839
blood it's not that's not food

2978.64 --> 2982.839
you know an engineer that claims mass

2980.96 --> 2985.839
directing mass

2982.839 --> 2985.839
really

2985.92 --> 2991.839
have you ever tried to confront them

2989.52 --> 2999.839
about okay so how does this work

2991.839 --> 2999.839
according to natural science

3007.839 --> 3013.839
necessary double thing neil degrasse

3016.0 --> 3019.52
that's that's interesting

3020.079 --> 3027.8390000000004
i haven't thought about that

3048.48 --> 3052.319
does a catholic church pass as mass

3051.119 --> 3055.839
attracting mass

3052.319 --> 3055.839
that's another type of mass

3057.839 --> 3064.72
so you could say that a mass might

3061.2 --> 3068.0
attract a mass as in

3064.72 --> 3071.359
the ritual the mass the thing may

3068.0 --> 3083.839
attract a crowd right

3071.359 --> 3083.839
but that's not scientific though

3092.4 --> 3096.64
i drag him through this scientific

3095.28 --> 3101.76
method and he says that's

3096.64 --> 3105.359
ninth grade definition oh really

3101.76 --> 3105.92
so he's he's is of the opinion that oh

3105.359 --> 3108.319
no

3105.92 --> 3110.48
science has many methods just that's

3108.319 --> 3112.72
just the start

3110.48 --> 3112.72
right

3115.2 --> 3120.5589999999997
yeah that happens a lot a lot of people

3118.4 --> 3125.839
unfortunately get fooled into thinking

3120.559 --> 3125.8390000000004
like that

3136.839 --> 3139.839
so

3150.839 --> 3153.839
hmm

3156.3 --> 3159.389
[Music]

3164.839 --> 3167.839
so

3169.119 --> 3172.6400000000003
the same engineers we don't feel earth

3171.28 --> 3176.88
rotation because of

3172.64 --> 3176.8799999999997
angular velocity oh my god

3178.839 --> 3181.839
ah

3196.78 --> 3199.929
[Music]

3207.04 --> 3209.839
hmm

3238.16 --> 3244.64
civil engineering underground setting

3240.72 --> 3244.64
drain works you understand the problem

3244.96 --> 3247.2
right

3248.839 --> 3253.839
yeah all draining pipes are straight

3257.839 --> 3261.52
would be very weird if you like all the

3260.319 --> 3264.48
drain works

3261.52 --> 3267.28
if you had to design it to account for

3264.48 --> 3269.44
the radius and like the curving level of

3267.28 --> 3272.48
water and all that nonsense

3269.44 --> 3274.4
yeah that would be quite weird

3272.48 --> 3276.559
so all you really have to know is that

3274.4 --> 3279.599
yeah water is always gonna try to go

3276.559 --> 3281.8390000000004
down it's always essential that

3279.599 --> 3283.52
if you want water to move in a singular

3281.839 --> 3286.799
direction in pipes

3283.52 --> 3290.64
you're gonna have to slant that pipe

3286.799 --> 3290.64
and then you have to know like how much

3291.359 --> 3296.0789999999997
with the preponderance of what can come

3293.839 --> 3298.16
through it and all

3296.079 --> 3299.2000000000003
in order for it not to get clogged too

3298.16 --> 3301.44
easily

3299.2 --> 3304.24
right so it's really all about just

3301.44 --> 3306.079
knowing that water is absolutely level

3304.24 --> 3309.2
and it always tries to go down and

3306.079 --> 3320.0
that's how you set up the pipeworks

3309.2 --> 3322.72
the sewers and all that

3320.0 --> 3324.4
believe this chat needs a pc principle

3322.72 --> 3335.839
what the [ __ ]

3324.4 --> 3335.839
no no it doesn't

3346.839 --> 3352.319
uh

3348.96 --> 3356.2400000000002
all right jared mother mathers

3352.319 --> 3363.839
masters oh gee

3356.24 --> 3363.839
that was a civil engineer all right

3378.96 --> 3384.88
what the uh bilge i no i don't hear it

3389.04 --> 3392.079
it doesn't sound like now in the arse it

3391.44 --> 3396.4
sounds like

3392.079 --> 3405.8390000000004
mara at ni tosh

3396.4 --> 3405.839
toys so no

3416.839 --> 3419.839
so

3426.72 --> 3430.24
all right yeah i remember that bill g

3428.88 --> 3434.1600000000003
yeah it was

3430.24 --> 3436.24
that was uncanny that was uncanny indeed

3434.16 --> 3438.799
like now there is a point

3436.24 --> 3440.24
obama when he kept saying yes we can

3438.799 --> 3444.64
thank you satan

3440.24 --> 3444.64
i remember that that that was freaky

3444.96 --> 3448.96
because it did actually sound like that

3447.52 --> 3452.72
when you reversed it

3448.96 --> 3455.359
absolutely it did and that was

3452.72 --> 3461.839
absolutely freaking it was freaking me

3455.359 --> 3461.839
out at the time

3462.4 --> 3475.839
hey julio papin good to see you

3500.839 --> 3505.599
hmm

3502.24 --> 3505.5989999999997
right well bill g

3505.92 --> 3511.52
most reverse sound

3509.2 --> 3512.8799999999997
sentences they really don't yield

3511.52 --> 3516.559
anything

3512.88 --> 3520.079
but yeah the yes we can reversing thing

3516.559 --> 3522.4
it really really did like sound like

3520.079 --> 3525.52
thank you satan

3522.4 --> 3529.28
and he said it so many times it was

3525.52 --> 3532.48
the trope it was what do you call it the

3529.28 --> 3535.28
the thing the campaign thing

3532.48 --> 3537.52
so for it to specifically sound reverse

3535.28 --> 3540.2400000000002
thank you satan it's just

3537.52 --> 3540.72
that's really in your face compared to

3540.24 --> 3542.9599999999996
ooh

3540.72 --> 3544.0
i might hear oh if you have you turned

3542.96 --> 3546.48
this sentence around

3544.0 --> 3547.119
it kind of sounds like yeah well this

3546.48 --> 3550.64
was like

3547.119 --> 3554.0
the political exit sentence

3550.64 --> 3557.1189999999997
the trope to use so poof

3554.0 --> 3559.839
that's really

3557.119 --> 3559.839
in your face

3561.04 --> 3565.599
like nothing else before that was the

3563.359 --> 3567.7599999999998
most in your face oh listen to what it

3565.599 --> 3573.839
sounds like in reverse

3567.76 --> 3573.8390000000004
of anything i've ever heard out there

3584.88 --> 3588.96
i wonder like maybe obama was even aware

3588.0 --> 3592.319
of that

3588.96 --> 3593.599
and that he specifically studied to say

3592.319 --> 3595.44
it in a way

3593.599 --> 3596.96
test it out what does it sound like in

3595.44 --> 3599.2000000000003
reverse to make

3596.96 --> 3601.359
it sound like thank you satan in reverse

3599.2 --> 3603.7599999999998
that he said it in a specific trained

3601.359 --> 3605.68
way specifically to make it sound like

3603.76 --> 3609.3590000000004
that if you played in reverse

3605.68 --> 3609.359
that might be a possibility

3609.839 --> 3615.839
set it in a very distinct way

3616.24 --> 3622.5589999999997
yes we can right not like

3619.44 --> 3625.44
yes we can that's how the sjw is

3622.559 --> 3628.079
whatever said no obama said it like

3625.44 --> 3630.079
very in a distinct way so it seemed to

3628.079 --> 3630.4
me like he might have actually known it

3630.079 --> 3633.119
and

3630.4 --> 3634.88
trained specifically to say it in a way

3633.119 --> 3635.76
that if you play it in reverse it would

3634.88 --> 3643.839
sound like that

3635.76 --> 3643.8390000000004
on purpose

3649.839 --> 3654.24
what do you think satan is satan is a

3651.92 --> 3657.6800000000003
spirit

3654.24 --> 3660.319
satan is lies

3657.68 --> 3661.04
and the power that come from lies and

3660.319 --> 3665.839
the price

3661.04 --> 3665.839
you pay because of it

3666.48 --> 3673.44
by god's design i don't think satan is a

3670.319 --> 3685.839
physical being i think he might be

3673.44 --> 3685.839
a spirit in the other dimension

3705.68 --> 3712.319
but you're not gonna literally find the

3708.88 --> 3714.1600000000003
embodiment of satan anywhere

3712.319 --> 3716.079
or maybe they tried something like that

3714.16 --> 3718.64
right because i

3716.079 --> 3720.88
i completely go understand that like

3718.64 --> 3724.0
real occultists the spiritists and the

3720.88 --> 3726.7200000000003
freaking satanist creepy bastards

3724.0 --> 3727.44
they'd probably try to create some kind

3726.72 --> 3730.9599999999996
of body

3727.44 --> 3734.48
for satan to possess

3730.96 --> 3735.76
like specifically for him that might be

3734.48 --> 3738.88
a thing

3735.76 --> 3741.8390000000004
but i don't think satan ever had if he

3738.88 --> 3743.44
it really is like a consciousness i

3741.839 --> 3744.72
don't think he ever really had a

3743.44 --> 3746.559
physical body

3744.72 --> 3755.839
if that's the case he probably always

3746.559 --> 3755.8390000000004
was like in the dream world

3760.0 --> 3765.68
oh well good servant that's

3763.44 --> 3766.839
your prerogative if you want to believe

3765.68 --> 3783.839
that

3766.839 --> 3783.839
that's that's your problem

3784.4 --> 3789.599
ray shadow legends ad that's actually a

3786.88 --> 3791.76
game i play

3789.599 --> 3793.599
if you're gonna try it out then please

3791.76 --> 3797.8390000000004
use my referral code

3793.599 --> 3797.839
because then i get some in-game goodies

3800.799 --> 3804.799
i actually find red shadow legends quite

3803.52 --> 3808.559
an entertaining game

3804.799 --> 3811.7599999999998
it's very much solo game

3808.559 --> 3812.799
but it's like it's like organizing

3811.76 --> 3816.7990000000004
building

3812.799 --> 3821.119
and it's really efficient

3816.799 --> 3823.44
like it's been very well balanced

3821.119 --> 3825.6800000000003
but it is basically a game that just

3823.44 --> 3827.44
well lets you play with a bunch of dolls

3825.68 --> 3828.16
that you keep on leveling up putting

3827.44 --> 3830.2400000000002
equipment

3828.16 --> 3833.1189999999997
on them and getting better and better it

3830.24 --> 3836.4799999999996
is really just like okay let's upgrade

3833.119 --> 3839.839
dolls they have they have nice figurines

3836.48 --> 3839.839
though of all kinds

3852.319 --> 3855.44
all right bill g

3856.24 --> 3860.5589999999997
i've been playing it from the start

3861.28 --> 3868.2400000000002
bit like a chucky doll then uh what

3865.359 --> 3868.24
the game no

3872.21 --> 3876.559
[Music]

3874.16 --> 3877.52
but just for the record i'm like in the

3876.559 --> 3881.92
game i'm

3877.52 --> 3883.7599999999998
what is it level 93 or something like i

3881.92 --> 3885.839
i really i'm playing it like i'm a no

3883.76 --> 3888.3190000000004
lifer because i play it pretty much

3885.839 --> 3888.319
every day

3890.799 --> 3895.839
me too cool

3899.039 --> 3902.7990000000004
right you can find me there if you want

3901.119 --> 3905.44
to i run a guild

3902.799 --> 3906.799
in there it's just that i'm not really

3905.44 --> 3908.88
communicating a lot so

3906.799 --> 3912.559
it's there's like three active players

3908.88 --> 3912.559
left but we're all pretty high level

3914.0 --> 3923.839
if you want to join it look up

3917.52 --> 3923.839
the fell horde too

3925.44 --> 3937.839
yes bad fee hello kitty island

3930.64 --> 3937.839
i've heard it's very popular

3945.119 --> 3951.839
no ralph rodriguez

3952.799 --> 3978.02
i doubt it

3964.079 --> 3981.4
south park reference no i missed it

3978.02 --> 3981.4
[Music]

3988.96 --> 3993.76
just throwing stuff out there no that's

3990.96 --> 3996.88
fine

3993.76 --> 4000.079
but yeah santa is fake

3996.88 --> 4002.6400000000003
and yeah the origins of it are very

4000.079 --> 4002.6400000000003
dubious

4004.559 --> 4013.119
like santa is probably based on

4009.039 --> 4016.7990000000004
creepy evil druids that would kidnap

4013.119 --> 4020.079
kids and sacrifice them and [ __ ] and use

4016.799 --> 4022.319
like hallucinogenic mushrooms on

4020.079 --> 4024.4
trees and celebrations and all kinds of

4022.319 --> 4028.0
freaky [ __ ] that happened in the very

4024.4 --> 4030.319
far past he's probably inspired on that

4028.0 --> 4035.839
like the entire setup of his story is

4030.319 --> 4035.839
very hella synergetic

4053.2 --> 4056.96
santa doesn't sacrifice children i'm not

4056.319 --> 4062.16
saying that

4056.96 --> 4064.799
he he's not real but he doesn't do that

4062.16 --> 4065.7599999999998
just saying it's probably inspired on

4064.799 --> 4068.88
something really

4065.76 --> 4077.8390000000004
[ __ ] up in the past and then turn

4068.88 --> 4077.839
into a commercialized thing

4088.079 --> 4095.6800000000003
he's a fake creature who leads a horde

4092.0 --> 4099.359
huh okay that's interesting

4095.68 --> 4104.48
well maybe he's an extra dimensional

4099.359 --> 4105.83
creature then

4104.48 --> 4107.678999999999
maybe he's based on that

4105.83 --> 4111.759
[Music]

4107.679 --> 4119.839
i don't know isn't santa turkish

4111.759 --> 4119.839
what are you babbling about

4124.4 --> 4133.839
has anyone seen odd video for michaela

4127.199 --> 4133.839
no i haven't

4142.239 --> 4145.44
trying to cut down on nets now that's

4144.159 --> 4147.599999999999
good good servant

4145.44 --> 4149.839
i'm glad you feel like you're ready for

4147.6 --> 4153.4400000000005
that

4149.839 --> 4155.6
i know your recovery situation has been

4153.44 --> 4161.839
rough on you for a very long time

4155.6 --> 4161.839
glad to hear you can do that now

4204.96 --> 4212.88
yeah pat fee uh i'll take the liberty

4209.84 --> 4215.6
to explain to you he's he has a physical

4212.88 --> 4218.8
condition like his stomach

4215.6 --> 4220.56
and it's due to issues that happen in

4218.8 --> 4223.04
the past medication that was kind of

4220.56 --> 4226.8
forced on him that really

4223.04 --> 4230.8
like damaged his stomach and he is

4226.8 --> 4233.12
in the process of recovering from it

4230.8 --> 4233.12
right

4241.76 --> 4245.84
well what's that ralph rodriguez

4250.64 --> 4259.84
part one march one oh that's

4254.64 --> 4259.84
not even a month ago

4273.28 --> 4279.599999999999
okay 15 minutes sounds like it's

4276.4 --> 4283.04
really creepy this video and

4279.6 --> 4283.04
like ultra squirting

4284.48 --> 4287.759999999999
i think this sounds like medical fear

4287.04 --> 4289.5199999999995
porn

4287.76 --> 4291.4400000000005
where things that are real are

4289.52 --> 4293.76
exaggerated

4291.44 --> 4293.759999999999
right

4294.96 --> 4299.04
because there's been that's been

4296.56 --> 4301.84
happening for decades

4299.04 --> 4301.84
right

4303.44 --> 4306.5599999999995
doesn't mean that it's all not real it's

4305.36 --> 4309.759999999999
just

4306.56 --> 4313.04
put together in a way to really over

4309.76 --> 4316.2390000000005
exaggerate the creepiness and

4313.04 --> 4318.08
and the evil i don't know i i'd have to

4316.239 --> 4319.04
watch it to make proper judgment it's

4318.08 --> 4321.04
just that i've seen

4319.04 --> 4322.88
quite a few of those types of videos i

4321.04 --> 4324.4
try not to watch them

4322.88 --> 4327.12
because they make me feel very

4324.4 --> 4327.12
uncomfortable

4338.159 --> 4347.04
oh jared mathers og near fatal oui

4343.44 --> 4347.04
i'm glad you got out of it alive

4353.6 --> 4360.0
some meds are great and actually benefit

4356.239 --> 4363.12
our system well that really depends

4360.0 --> 4363.12
it really depends

4365.52 --> 4371.84
pat v like what are they

4374.239 --> 4378.48
right i take supplements i consider the

4377.6 --> 4381.92
supplements

4378.48 --> 4384.959999999999
food food is the medicine

4381.92 --> 4385.52
it's a rule of fist because it's food

4384.96 --> 4388.96
based

4385.52 --> 4390.88
now a lot of pharmaca is doesn't do it

4388.96 --> 4393.76
like that it doesn't just nourish you it

4390.88 --> 4393.76
tries to like

4394.0 --> 4398.0
well pharmaceutical wise alter certain

4397.36 --> 4401.36
states or

4398.0 --> 4404.56
like re-route processes but most of that

4401.36 --> 4407.5199999999995
has long-term side effects

4404.56 --> 4407.52
and detriments

4408.44 --> 4413.839999999999
metformin helps diabetic stay alive

4414.32 --> 4418.48
is that like the anti-diabetes standard

4417.679 --> 4422.4
stuff

4418.48 --> 4422.4
to what is it called again

4423.6 --> 4427.120000000001
right but but that's different though

4425.28 --> 4428.88
because that is

4427.12 --> 4429.12
if i'm correct if it what is it called

4428.88 --> 4430.88
again

4429.12 --> 4434.0
[Music]

4430.88 --> 4436.88
insulin is that insulin

4434.0 --> 4438.719
because insulin is a natural product is

4436.88 --> 4441.28
literally a product that

4438.719 --> 4441.76
is also produced in the body right so

4441.28 --> 4445.12
that's

4441.76 --> 4448.96
that's not really insulin regulator

4445.12 --> 4452.239
okay okay right

4448.96 --> 4455.679
did you know however that if you

4452.239 --> 4458.4
kind of step away from that you can

4455.679 --> 4459.28
it's not insulin okay it's a it's a

4458.4 --> 4463.28
regulator

4459.28 --> 4469.84
sure however

4463.28 --> 4469.84
you can actually fix diabetes

4472.719 --> 4478.719
right like if you have complete

4476.44 --> 4483.839999999999
disintegration of like the insulin

4478.719 --> 4483.84
system in your what was it the

4485.04 --> 4488.159
[Music]

4494.84 --> 4497.84
okay

4499.12 --> 4502.88
the pancreas if your pancreas is

4501.12 --> 4505.44
completely

4502.88 --> 4506.2390000000005
destroyed in its insulin capabilities

4505.44 --> 4509.28
then you

4506.239 --> 4510.32
will have a problem right

4509.28 --> 4512.719
yeah you're going to have to

4510.32 --> 4515.36
artificially deal with that but if

4512.719 --> 4517.6
if you have any kind of like it doesn't

4515.36 --> 4521.04
work right enough it's out of balance

4517.6 --> 4524.88
you can actually think

4521.04 --> 4527.44
on average completely fix it

4524.88 --> 4528.4800000000005
you'll have to maintain it the rest of

4527.44 --> 4532.32
your life though

4528.48 --> 4534.48
through sensible food regulation

4532.32 --> 4536.4
ensuring you don't get the poisons that

4534.48 --> 4538.08
actually detriment and grade you like

4536.4 --> 4540.239
don't go

4538.08 --> 4543.44
fructose corn syrup avoid that sort of

4540.239 --> 4546.879999999999
[ __ ] at all cost right all that

4543.44 --> 4548.4
but you can pretty much restore it

4546.88 --> 4550.159000000001
it's not like oh the first signs of the

4548.4 --> 4553.36
diabetes okay that means

4550.159 --> 4554.239
you get the insulin and all that and now

4553.36 --> 4556.719
you do that

4554.239 --> 4557.36
because your body is gonna lose control

4556.719 --> 4560.88
well

4557.36 --> 4567.839999999999
no you can actually

4560.88 --> 4567.84
get rid of that condition

4569.199 --> 4574.239
that's right pathfi that's the main

4571.44 --> 4574.239
problem isn't it

4575.84 --> 4580.96
people get addicted to things that doom

4579.12 --> 4583.92
them

4580.96 --> 4585.92
and it's their in ability or their lack

4583.92 --> 4586.88
of will to change their habits and

4585.92 --> 4589.76
dedicate to it

4586.88 --> 4591.84
and find new purpose within the new

4589.76 --> 4593.679
format

4591.84 --> 4595.84
yeah those are the ones that eventually

4593.679 --> 4601.04
get it

4595.84 --> 4601.04
and then they yeah they become medically

4606.84 --> 4613.28
dependent

4608.8 --> 4616.159000000001
type 1 dfb insulin dependent

4613.28 --> 4617.5199999999995
well right well if you really start

4616.159 --> 4619.839999999999
taking insulin and

4617.52 --> 4620.719
and your insulin internal production is

4619.84 --> 4622.8
completely

4620.719 --> 4625.199
destroyed there are certain types of

4622.8 --> 4628.2390000000005
cells in there

4625.199 --> 4629.5199999999995
in the pancreas that that do that

4628.239 --> 4631.759999999999
specific production

4629.52 --> 4635.52
if they get completely disintegrated

4631.76 --> 4638.159000000001
like by a massive allergic response

4635.52 --> 4639.679
and like there's no more room for it to

4638.159 --> 4641.199
grow back yeah then

4639.679 --> 4643.4400000000005
you might have that condition

4641.199 --> 4647.36
permanently

4643.44 --> 4648.5599999999995
but don't underestimate the regenerative

4647.36 --> 4651.679
capabilities

4648.56 --> 4653.92
and the dynamics of the body

4651.679 --> 4655.84
if you provide the right condition more

4653.92 --> 4658.4
things can regenerate than we take

4655.84 --> 4661.12
credit for

4658.4 --> 4661.839999999999
and that includes brain damage by the

4661.12 --> 4663.5199999999995
way

4661.84 --> 4665.04
it's very fascinating it's one of the

4663.52 --> 4665.76
claims that is made like oh it's

4665.04 --> 4667.6
completely

4665.76 --> 4668.8
oh it reversed but once you get it you

4667.6 --> 4672.320000000001
never get it back

4668.8 --> 4674.2390000000005
well back to differ

4672.32 --> 4677.599999999999
i think a whole bunch of things in the

4674.239 --> 4681.5599999999995
body can be regenerated

4677.6 --> 4685.84
right like even scar tissue

4681.56 --> 4688.719
regenerates if you have the right

4685.84 --> 4690.96
metabolic system to actually get to that

4688.719 --> 4694.4800000000005
process where your scars will

4690.96 --> 4696.4800000000005
start to like stop like the scar tissue

4694.48 --> 4697.36
will go away will be replaced with the

4696.48 --> 4700.639999999999
original

4697.36 --> 4702.719
things that are supposed to be there

4700.64 --> 4705.04
even teeth well that would be

4702.719 --> 4707.199
fascinating ralph rodriguez

4705.04 --> 4709.44
i could certainly use it i know that

4707.199 --> 4709.44
like

4709.679 --> 4717.76
cavities as they call it i know

4713.52 --> 4717.76
it's not what it seems right

4719.28 --> 4722.719
and i've had it before where i would go

4720.96 --> 4724.159
to the dentist they would point out oh

4722.719 --> 4724.96
you have a cavity here and there and

4724.159 --> 4726.4
there

4724.96 --> 4728.96
when they were going to work on

4726.4 --> 4731.5199999999995
something else like removing

4728.96 --> 4732.4800000000005
like the what's called wisdom teeth in

4731.52 --> 4735.280000000001
back

4732.48 --> 4735.678999999999
i would point it out and i'd be like

4735.28 --> 4739.28
like

4735.679 --> 4741.4400000000005
yeah i don't care like no no

4739.28 --> 4742.4
i don't want these cavities to be taken

4741.44 --> 4744.48
care of

4742.4 --> 4746.4
thanks for pointing it out though now i

4744.48 --> 4747.5199999999995
know something about the condition in my

4746.4 --> 4750.08
mouth

4747.52 --> 4752.080000000001
i'm not gonna go by your standards guess

4750.08 --> 4753.679
what the next time i came to the dentist

4752.08 --> 4755.44
which was the last time

4753.679 --> 4758.4800000000005
ever by the way except for my

4755.44 --> 4761.678999999999
ex-girlfriend who is a dentist

4758.48 --> 4762.639999999999
yeah next time he checked it was all

4761.679 --> 4766.32
gone

4762.64 --> 4768.159000000001
no more cavities yeah i never forgot

4766.32 --> 4770.08
that moment right because

4768.159 --> 4772.48
there is just this suggestion that when

4770.08 --> 4774.48
you get cavities it never goes away you

4772.48 --> 4779.12
always have to fill it up

4774.48 --> 4779.12
no it does actually go away

4779.199 --> 4784.239
right dental work in my opinion is

4782.96 --> 4786.56
really kind of like

4784.239 --> 4787.678999999999
mostly pain control people go to the

4786.56 --> 4790.96
dentist when they just

4787.679 --> 4794.32
lose their mind from pain

4790.96 --> 4797.44
but technically

4794.32 --> 4799.199
you don't have to unless you like break

4797.44 --> 4802.08
a tee a tooth right that's just

4799.199 --> 4802.08
very dramatic

4802.239 --> 4808.638999999999
and hey i have a broken tooth

4806.0 --> 4809.84
partially broken a part of it broke off

4808.639 --> 4813.28
that happened

4809.84 --> 4814.2390000000005
over a year ago i have some problems

4813.28 --> 4817.5199999999995
with that

4814.239 --> 4820.4
molar i have

4817.52 --> 4821.679
sometimes i have pain but as long as i

4820.4 --> 4824.96
just i'm careful

4821.679 --> 4828.08
no this

4824.96 --> 4830.08
i don't need to i don't need to go to

4828.08 --> 4833.04
the dentist for this

4830.08 --> 4834.88
it's not like urgent it's not growing

4833.04 --> 4837.92
out of control and i'm gonna die

4834.88 --> 4839.6
if i don't fix it soon right and i avoid

4837.92 --> 4842.08
that kind of

4839.6 --> 4843.280000000001
thinking about it like that but i am

4842.08 --> 4846.4
careful

4843.28 --> 4848.08
right i can't just chew like i'm 12

4846.4 --> 4852.32
years old and just i

4848.08 --> 4852.32
i know i have to be careful how i eat

4854.48 --> 4860.48
and eventually i do want to go to the

4856.719 --> 4861.36
dentist just to kind of like fill in the

4860.48 --> 4863.839999999999
gap

4861.36 --> 4865.839999999999
where that little part is broken off it

4863.84 --> 4867.76
is like a danger something can get in

4865.84 --> 4870.32
between during chewing and then

4867.76 --> 4871.76
push against the tooth in a wrong way

4870.32 --> 4873.44
causing pain in the nerve

4871.76 --> 4875.6
and i kind of want it fixed so i can

4873.44 --> 4878.48
just properly chew with it again

4875.6 --> 4878.719
so it's the need for me to get a dentist

4878.48 --> 4882.638999999999
is

4878.719 --> 4888.4800000000005
cosmetic it's actually cosmetic or

4882.639 --> 4890.159000000001
is that cosmetic well pretty much

4888.48 --> 4893.28
if they're going to tell me er it has

4890.159 --> 4898.4
cavity in it this is like i don't care

4893.28 --> 4901.44
just get a piece in there on there

4898.4 --> 4905.839999999999
so that it's can function like a tooth

4901.44 --> 4905.839999999999
again and i'll worry about the cavities

4906.32 --> 4911.36
right but before i can even attempt that

4909.36 --> 4914.159
i'm gonna have to get like my medical

4911.36 --> 4916.32
insurance situation in order and

4914.159 --> 4918.48
on top of that have like a whole bunch

4916.32 --> 4918.88
of financial maneuvering room to do it

4918.48 --> 4924.5599999999995
because

4918.88 --> 4924.56
dentists anywhere are freaking expensive

4925.04 --> 4928.8
but i can survive like this i have for

4927.679 --> 4932.0
over a year

4928.8 --> 4932.0
it's not grown worse

4935.6 --> 4939.280000000001
crisper technology can

4939.679 --> 4948.4800000000005
no no don't need that

4944.56 --> 4951.76
no you don't need that the body

4948.48 --> 4953.919999999999
can do it with the right

4951.76 --> 4955.52
with the right supplement input with the

4953.92 --> 4957.6
right substances

4955.52 --> 4959.84
the body can regenerate a whole bunch of

4957.6 --> 4959.84
things

4960.8 --> 4966.0
can regenerate nerves that have been

4963.44 --> 4966.0
damaged

4968.719 --> 4973.84
for starters

4980.32 --> 4988.639
hey scuba dracula

4986.639 --> 4991.92
here is this flood what's on the other

4988.639 --> 4991.92
side there is no other side

4998.08 --> 5003.92
there's just the bottom part

5001.28 --> 5005.44
which eventually leads to the end of

5003.92 --> 5008.4
space

5005.44 --> 5009.919999999999
the end of physical room that material

5008.4 --> 5013.199
can move into

5009.92 --> 5014.8
it's gonna rest on that end of space

5013.199 --> 5016.96
unless there's something really weird

5014.8 --> 5020.159000000001
happening

5016.96 --> 5023.6
where there is a loop from up to down

5020.159 --> 5026.96
and it'll end in the bottom of the realm

5023.6 --> 5030.56
being the top of our realm

5026.96 --> 5032.639
right that's remains a

5030.56 --> 5035.120000000001
remote possibility that that could be

5032.639 --> 5035.12
the case

5040.8 --> 5043.84
a clutch bear

5073.199 --> 5078.32
hmm is it at all okay that's interesting

5078.639 --> 5085.84
i remember cylitol

5081.76 --> 5085.84
can do that

5127.36 --> 5135.5199999999995
good don't take it

5130.639 --> 5135.52
good servant just [ __ ] the peer pressure

5137.52 --> 5142.56
you know what if people do that to you i

5140.56 --> 5144.719
i don't know if it's safe though you

5142.56 --> 5146.56
have to know that for yourself but i

5144.719 --> 5147.76
would just like peer pressure them right

5146.56 --> 5149.76
back

5147.76 --> 5150.96
just tell them like oh yeah but it's a

5149.76 --> 5154.08
lie it's

5150.96 --> 5157.04
a total lie it's a eugenics operation

5154.08 --> 5159.76
right and the earth is flat are you

5157.04 --> 5162.32
still going to recommend it to me

5159.76 --> 5164.56
now that i told you what it really is

5162.32 --> 5164.5599999999995
right

5165.199 --> 5169.44
but yeah you you have to be the judge

5167.36 --> 5172.32
whether that's a safe thing to do

5169.44 --> 5172.32
in your position

5172.639 --> 5183.84
hey getting wisdom good to see you

5199.52 --> 5203.679
possibly not being able to regrow teeth

5202.4 --> 5206.5599999999995
well

5203.679 --> 5208.8
regrow it from scratch because how are

5206.56 --> 5211.76
you gonna get the nerve back in

5208.8 --> 5214.96
right that that might be possible but it

5211.76 --> 5218.159000000001
would be a really complicated operation

5214.96 --> 5220.0
but when a tooth is i don't know damaged

5218.159 --> 5222.32
or something as long as the nerve is

5220.0 --> 5222.32
still

5222.84 --> 5239.84
there i bet that there are ways to

5226.56 --> 5239.84
actually regrow it

5241.52 --> 5248.2390000000005
they make fun of me for flat earth okay

5245.04 --> 5251.679
well dude i'd rather be made fun of

5248.239 --> 5253.28
for flat earth than having constant

5251.679 --> 5254.96
whining to my head about you know you

5253.28 --> 5258.239
got to take the vaccine

5254.96 --> 5260.56
i'd rather have just people be like haha

5258.239 --> 5261.919999999999
flat earther is silly

5260.56 --> 5263.92
then constant oh you're going to take

5261.92 --> 5267.84
the vaccine you got to take the vaccine

5263.92 --> 5267.84
right wouldn't you

5282.56 --> 5288.88
uh well jared mathers

5285.6 --> 5290.8
og the mandela effect i think

5288.88 --> 5293.12
it's not what they say it is i think the

5290.8 --> 5295.1990000000005
mandela effect is a purely psychological

5293.12 --> 5299.5199999999995
effect

5295.199 --> 5302.159
and it's been tinkered with on purpose

5299.52 --> 5304.0
i can explain the mandela effect because

5302.159 --> 5309.199
what i think it is is that

5304.0 --> 5313.679
products names

5309.199 --> 5316.4
typical names and iconic

5313.679 --> 5317.6
sentences right that were made to be

5316.4 --> 5322.08
iconic

5317.6 --> 5324.8
have been altered during production

5322.08 --> 5325.28
when it first came out in a way that

5324.8 --> 5328.639
they

5325.28 --> 5329.84
know exactly how people are going to

5328.639 --> 5332.0
rearrange

5329.84 --> 5334.08
those alterations in their mind to make

5332.0 --> 5337.92
it how it should be

5334.08 --> 5340.4
and then that is how we remember it and

5337.92 --> 5344.56
that is how we echo it on with others

5340.4 --> 5348.5599999999995
we forget that it was actually different

5344.56 --> 5351.76
because that difference is wrong

5348.56 --> 5353.120000000001
the difference that it really is like it

5351.76 --> 5356.8
was different

5353.12 --> 5359.599999999999
it's wrong we felt it's wrong to

5356.8 --> 5360.96
do it like that so we then automatically

5359.6 --> 5362.96
that happens with a whole bunch of

5360.96 --> 5365.04
people

5362.96 --> 5367.04
there's a modified version that we in

5365.04 --> 5367.36
our own minds in our own imagination

5367.04 --> 5370.32
with

5367.36 --> 5372.5599999999995
our feelings make and then there is a

5370.32 --> 5373.5199999999995
consensus to that and that happens very

5372.56 --> 5375.92
quickly

5373.52 --> 5377.360000000001
we start calling it by how we feel it

5375.92 --> 5379.1990000000005
should be called and then

5377.36 --> 5381.36
everybody starts echoing that and then

5379.199 --> 5384.48
we forget no wait it's actually

5381.36 --> 5385.5199999999995
pronounced differently and yeah it's

5384.48 --> 5388.159
stupid

5385.52 --> 5388.96
but they made it stupid on purpose

5388.159 --> 5391.36
because

5388.96 --> 5393.679
just to achieve this effect is screw

5391.36 --> 5407.839999999999
with you

5393.679 --> 5407.84
for the fun of it huh hold on

5440.0 --> 5451.92
all right

5449.679 --> 5455.1990000000005
yeah there was roommate asking if she

5451.92 --> 5455.1990000000005
could borrow some equipment

5458.08 --> 5462.0
i think the mandela effect can easily be

5460.32 --> 5464.639
explained by people suffering from

5462.0 --> 5466.4
poor memory well it's not poor memory

5464.639 --> 5471.36
it's just that

5466.4 --> 5474.32
people when they read things they

5471.36 --> 5475.5199999999995
if there's something like wrong with it

5474.32 --> 5477.84
for any reason

5475.52 --> 5480.080000000001
it feels wrong then they correct it and

5477.84 --> 5482.32
the way they correct it is usually

5480.08 --> 5485.04
extremely similar

5482.32 --> 5485.04
so it's like

5486.239 --> 5494.0
producers screw with the name

5490.88 --> 5497.12
on purpose and then everybody

5494.0 --> 5501.6
remembers it how it should be

5497.12 --> 5504.159
according to universal feeling consensus

5501.6 --> 5505.92
and then they forget that it's actually

5504.159 --> 5508.799999999999
not supposed to be like that

5505.92 --> 5510.639
in the real thing and that's how the

5508.8 --> 5513.1990000000005
mandela effect arrived

5510.639 --> 5514.32
by basically confronting people with no

5513.199 --> 5516.32
this is how it is

5514.32 --> 5518.32
yeah you remember it differently oh it

5516.32 --> 5521.92
must be something magical

5518.32 --> 5525.5199999999995
no but it is a trick

5521.92 --> 5525.52
being played on people

5530.32 --> 5533.36
and it has nothing to do with as tension

5532.4 --> 5536.4
spans of of

5533.36 --> 5537.04
goldfish no it is because it doesn't

5536.4 --> 5541.12
just work

5537.04 --> 5541.12
on people that have low attention span

5541.84 --> 5547.84
it works on everybody works on it worked

5544.88 --> 5547.84
on me

5555.04 --> 5561.04
oh ouch ralph rodriguez it might be

5559.36 --> 5562.88
designed to gather data on what people

5561.04 --> 5564.0
remember or rather how they remember

5562.88 --> 5567.52
things

5564.0 --> 5569.84
in order to figure out how to more

5567.52 --> 5572.0
effectively rewrite history without

5569.84 --> 5574.8
people catching on to it

5572.0 --> 5576.639
could be that could very well be ralph

5574.8 --> 5578.719
rodriguez

5576.639 --> 5579.84
that that is why they did it to test

5578.719 --> 5582.4
that out in

5579.84 --> 5584.08
anticipation of gaining new world order

5582.4 --> 5588.879999999999
control and then completely

5584.08 --> 5592.48
[ __ ] up the minds

5588.88 --> 5593.4400000000005
of everybody in their peak control 1984

5592.48 --> 5595.36
society

5593.44 --> 5597.28
when they can literally just rewrite

5595.36 --> 5599.92
everything and make it as stupid

5597.28 --> 5601.04
and insane and maniacal as possible so

5599.92 --> 5604.719
that everybody just

5601.04 --> 5606.88
never recovers it could be

5604.719 --> 5617.28
that it was meant for that it's no proof

5606.88 --> 5619.28
for it though

5617.28 --> 5621.84
all right but i i never thought like oh

5619.28 --> 5623.92
literally they changed details because

5621.84 --> 5627.12
it's always the freaking details right

5623.92 --> 5630.96
if the mandela effect was like a

5627.12 --> 5633.12
magical alteration of the timeline

5630.96 --> 5636.4800000000005
then why aren't there like really

5633.12 --> 5636.48
dramatical things

5636.56 --> 5640.719
a lot of them right why so many little

5639.76 --> 5644.4800000000005
stupid things

5640.719 --> 5644.96
that makes no sense at all but like oh

5644.48 --> 5648.32
let's

5644.96 --> 5649.52
need let's change reality through time

5648.32 --> 5652.639
by

5649.52 --> 5654.719
having stupid minor alterations that are

5652.639 --> 5656.08
completely pointless just to [ __ ] with

5654.719 --> 5659.84
people

5656.08 --> 5659.84
that makes no sense at all

5661.76 --> 5668.2390000000005
it's obviously like a trick

5664.8 --> 5671.679
a mind trick that marketeers have

5668.239 --> 5674.5599999999995
used on their products just to screw

5671.679 --> 5687.84
with people and see what would happen

5674.56 --> 5687.84
and how they deal with it

5723.6 --> 5728.0
is it me or is this stream jumping what

5726.719 --> 5731.199
do you mean jumping

5728.0 --> 5731.199
jumping like what

5738.32 --> 5743.84
what does that mean sleeping warrior

5751.76 --> 5754.96
hey iron26

5755.119 --> 5758.48
right george sanford internet was given

5756.96 --> 5760.2390000000005
to the public in the name of sharing

5758.48 --> 5764.718999999999
info when in reality was given

5760.239 --> 5764.718999999999
to take your info yeah both

5765.199 --> 5773.44
it's take some give some

5770.4 --> 5775.44
right information is power

5773.44 --> 5777.36
and of course those that have

5775.44 --> 5778.719
information to hand out also want

5777.36 --> 5781.44
information

5778.719 --> 5785.84
very likely so yeah it was always going

5781.44 --> 5785.839999999999
to be like that

5789.92 --> 5793.1990000000005
i mean it seems like a logical trade-off

5792.239 --> 5796.839999999999
if you are

5793.199 --> 5800.4
supposedly going to be engaging in to

5796.84 --> 5803.1990000000005
attain everything all knowledge

5800.4 --> 5805.28
as much as possible then it's very

5803.199 --> 5809.919999999999
likely that

5805.28 --> 5809.92
your knowledge about you shall also be

5810.84 --> 5813.84
attained

5824.84 --> 5840.88
um

5826.32 --> 5843.679
yeah i heard of that

5840.88 --> 5845.4400000000005
the internet is a pandora's box well

5843.679 --> 5849.36
what's the point it's open

5845.44 --> 5851.678999999999
it's open it's here

5849.36 --> 5854.08
it's been here for a while what is it

5851.679 --> 5856.719
gonna happen with it

5854.08 --> 5860.0
right internet is just an alternative

5856.719 --> 5860.0
route of communication

5860.4 --> 5865.44
with another frequency of interfacing

5863.04 --> 5867.679
and with its own dilemmas and its own

5865.44 --> 5870.239
seductions

5867.679 --> 5872.4800000000005
one we know all too well and that is

5870.239 --> 5878.0
that people going on the internet

5872.48 --> 5878.0
very easily seduced to remain anonymous

5878.32 --> 5883.679
and to let go of really bad behavior

5881.92 --> 5885.6
that face to face they would never

5883.679 --> 5888.4
right so that is one of the seduction

5885.6 --> 5888.400000000001
parts of it

5893.28 --> 5899.5199999999995
that's not good for you

5896.32 --> 5903.36
well i disagree i just disagree

5899.52 --> 5905.280000000001
it's it's just a mixed bag this box

5903.36 --> 5906.96
called the internet it contains a mixed

5905.28 --> 5910.08
bag some will go

5906.96 --> 5912.08
there will be trolls right

5910.08 --> 5914.48
there will be people that completely

5912.08 --> 5917.44
screw themselves up with the internet

5914.48 --> 5918.5599999999995
but there's also people that really

5917.44 --> 5920.96
crush it

5918.56 --> 5922.400000000001
thanks to the internet that would have

5920.96 --> 5924.56
been stuck to

5922.4 --> 5925.759999999999
crushing it on a much smaller scale

5924.56 --> 5927.92
because of the limited

5925.76 --> 5930.0
information sources they have and it's

5927.92 --> 5930.88
much more difficult to sift through it

5930.0 --> 5933.28
all

5930.88 --> 5934.56
if it's all books and figure out what is

5933.28 --> 5936.639
misinformation

5934.56 --> 5938.159000000001
if you don't have like infinite cross

5936.639 --> 5939.76
referencing like you have on the

5938.159 --> 5943.119
internet

5939.76 --> 5945.84
if you seek it right

5943.119 --> 5948.239
so yeah it's a mixed bag always was

5945.84 --> 5948.2390000000005
gonna be

5948.32 --> 5953.84
it's definitely not all bad

5978.88 --> 5984.32
oh my god why why do you keep asking

5985.28 --> 5995.84
who why does it matter if randy changed

5989.6 --> 5995.84
sides why do you care

6006.84 --> 6009.84
fine

6028.08 --> 6033.44
all right ranty i just call him chanty

6034.84 --> 6037.84
now

6050.48 --> 6053.5199999999995
you don't know who he is

6054.56 --> 6065.84
yeah it's before your time i guess

6068.96 --> 6075.119
uh okay bill g

6072.239 --> 6075.759999999999
you're taking it way too serious like

6075.119 --> 6078.48
that

6075.76 --> 6079.04
if allopathic medicine was just fixes

6078.48 --> 6080.159
symptoms

6079.04 --> 6081.5199999999995
and not the cause of the issue the

6080.159 --> 6082.879999999999
vaccine is supposed to help your

6081.52 --> 6085.119000000001
symptoms

6082.88 --> 6086.56
before you get it would it be free

6085.119 --> 6088.799999999999
allopathy

6086.56 --> 6088.8
well

6089.76 --> 6096.88
preemptive allopathy i guess which is

6093.199 --> 6101.119
totally stupid and ineffective

6096.88 --> 6101.119
if it actually did help

6101.6 --> 6108.96
and it doesn't

6106.639 --> 6108.96
right

6111.92 --> 6116.56
like to say that these vaccines of all

6115.199 --> 6120.0
the brands all of them

6116.56 --> 6123.52
if you say this works against kofi

6120.0 --> 6126.8
is an absolute lie it is so

6123.52 --> 6128.88
blatant such a blatant lie that it is

6126.8 --> 6132.08
really criminal to say that

6128.88 --> 6135.36
in my opinion it's criminal

6132.08 --> 6137.6
because it absolutely does not in

6135.36 --> 6139.679
any form and when you look into the

6137.6 --> 6140.159000000001
literature nothing that it's supposed to

6139.679 --> 6143.4400000000005
do

6140.159 --> 6147.119
actually helps in any way to

6143.44 --> 6149.119
the virus condition so it's a condition

6147.119 --> 6151.119
it's not actually a disease it's not

6149.119 --> 6154.48
infectious it's a condition that it

6151.119 --> 6157.599999999999
comes afloat in your body

6154.48 --> 6161.119
because of all kinds of factors right

6157.6 --> 6164.320000000001
it doesn't do anything about it

6161.119 --> 6166.639
at all every time it's like although

6164.32 --> 6170.0
let's make some excuses

6166.639 --> 6173.4400000000005
it it can do something about no

6170.0 --> 6176.88
lie it's a lie

6173.44 --> 6178.159
nothing zero it does nothing to prevent

6176.88 --> 6182.400000000001
covid or to

6178.159 --> 6184.5599999999995
fix it or anything positive with it

6182.4 --> 6186.0
whether you believe it's actually an

6184.56 --> 6188.96
infectious thing

6186.0 --> 6191.04
or you just recognize it for the bodily

6188.96 --> 6193.199
condition that it actually is

6191.04 --> 6196.32
because virus bodies are produced in the

6193.199 --> 6198.48
body naturally at all times

6196.32 --> 6199.36
just the more you produce it the worse

6198.48 --> 6201.5199999999995
you are at

6199.36 --> 6202.799999999999
and the more toxicity needs cleaning up

6201.52 --> 6206.719
that's what they do

6202.8 --> 6209.28
right vaccine literally does nothing

6206.719 --> 6211.199
to influence it in any positive way

6209.28 --> 6214.8
nothing

6211.199 --> 6217.04
it is technically a lie technically a

6214.8 --> 6217.04
lie

6217.199 --> 6221.759999999999
and it's criminal to suggest that facts

6219.679 --> 6223.4400000000005
that these vaccines which aren't even

6221.76 --> 6227.360000000001
vaccines

6223.44 --> 6230.4
do anything for the condition

6227.36 --> 6233.36
it's no proof it does there's no proof

6230.4 --> 6235.599999999999
in the literature of all this stuff all

6233.36 --> 6236.0
these vaccines that it actually does

6235.6 --> 6239.280000000001
that

6236.0 --> 6240.159
there's no empirical evidence that it

6239.28 --> 6245.84
does that it's

6240.159 --> 6247.92
all hundred percent lies criminal lies

6245.84 --> 6249.04
bother making effects it's called

6247.92 --> 6253.4400000000005
eugenics

6249.04 --> 6256.32
it's called a depopulation sterilization

6253.44 --> 6257.36
control program it's not the first time

6256.32 --> 6260.08
this has happened

6257.36 --> 6262.32
in history it happened last century as

6260.08 --> 6262.32
well

6262.96 --> 6269.679
it's a culling operation it's to kill

6266.48 --> 6270.08
people that are too feeble to critically

6269.679 --> 6273.36
think

6270.08 --> 6275.6
about things that are life and death

6273.36 --> 6277.679
situat scenarios

6275.6 --> 6278.88
that's what it's for does it make you

6277.679 --> 6282.639
sterile

6278.88 --> 6289.84
yeah yeah it does

6282.639 --> 6289.84
in different ways

6291.52 --> 6299.679
for one it definitely sterilizes women

6296.239 --> 6300.48
because a typical already discovered

6299.679 --> 6303.84
side effect

6300.48 --> 6304.638999999999
is that it attacks it causes the body to

6303.84 --> 6307.84
produce

6304.639 --> 6310.4800000000005
proteins this is one of the more known

6307.84 --> 6311.92
shut your [ __ ] mouth raziel get the

6310.48 --> 6315.5199999999995
[ __ ] out of my show

6311.92 --> 6320.679
[ __ ] scumbag pharmaceutical apologist

6315.52 --> 6323.679
scumbag satanist lying piece of [ __ ]

6320.679 --> 6323.679
eugenicist

6326.32 --> 6330.32
yeah it attacks these proteins attack

6329.28 --> 6333.04
the placenta

6330.32 --> 6334.719
causing pregnancies to naturally abort

6333.04 --> 6337.239
well not naturally to

6334.719 --> 6340.2390000000005
from the inside abort right

6337.239 --> 6340.239
sterilization

6341.76 --> 6344.8
right i don't know if it detects men's

6343.76 --> 6347.360000000001
balls or anything

6344.8 --> 6349.92
probably probably dude that's what it's

6347.36 --> 6352.96
designed for it's a sterilization

6349.92 --> 6354.4
eugenics operation to call the

6352.96 --> 6357.52
population and that's

6354.4 --> 6360.638999999999
the only thing it is

6357.52 --> 6373.84
the only thing there is no

6360.639 --> 6373.84
other factor to it other than this

6382.17 --> 6387.679
[Music]

6384.239 --> 6389.919999999999
where did you find this it's called

6387.679 --> 6391.28
hearing out a whole bunch of doctors

6389.92 --> 6394.719
that i respect

6391.28 --> 6397.36
that actually did the in-depth studies

6394.719 --> 6398.639
revealed it in presentations that have

6397.36 --> 6402.239
been seeing

6398.639 --> 6404.719
in the last year more than a year

6402.239 --> 6405.599999999999
one by one more and more testimonies

6404.719 --> 6409.679
more and more people

6405.6 --> 6409.679
specialists in in that field

6410.48 --> 6416.5599999999995
in in allopathic medicine and in

6413.36 --> 6416.5599999999995
alternative circles

6416.719 --> 6423.84
that's what it is i am not

6420.08 --> 6426.639
going to shove book works in your face

6423.84 --> 6428.0
because you're too stupid and stubborn

6426.639 --> 6431.52
to recognize it for

6428.0 --> 6433.84
what it is right if you have to

6431.52 --> 6434.8
act like a baller in the face of it and

6433.84 --> 6438.400000000001
just deny

6434.8 --> 6440.320000000001
anything of what i just said then take

6438.4 --> 6444.32
the [ __ ] vaccine and

6440.32 --> 6457.84
die [ __ ] do it then

6444.32 --> 6457.84
do it take it and die

6473.76 --> 6480.2390000000005
i don't care i don't care

6477.36 --> 6481.839999999999
2x's remote i don't care about that at

6480.239 --> 6484.5599999999995
all

6481.84 --> 6486.8
why the anger because people are too

6484.56 --> 6489.119000000001
stupid to save their own lives that's

6486.8 --> 6489.119000000001
why

6495.679 --> 6501.28
i already explained to you rough outlay

6498.48 --> 6501.28
of what it does

6502.48 --> 6506.5599999999995
i don't care if you need to have the

6505.6 --> 6510.2390000000005
book works

6506.56 --> 6512.4800000000005
shoved in your [ __ ] face like it's my

6510.239 --> 6515.759999999999
duty to actually literally

6512.48 --> 6519.5199999999995
change your mind because you're too

6515.76 --> 6527.84
lazy too stupid too stubborn

6519.52 --> 6527.84
to figure it out yourself

6532.96 --> 6536.4
what are the main reasons the

6534.239 --> 6540.799999999999
controllers are trying to kill people

6536.4 --> 6543.839999999999
because too much people it's too

6540.8 --> 6546.2390000000005
hard to control it eugenics is a

6543.84 --> 6550.400000000001
controller scheme it is a satanic

6546.239 --> 6553.36
rooted rooted in satanism control scheme

6550.4 --> 6555.36
if you kill a whole bunch of people make

6553.36 --> 6556.96
them do it them to themselves

6555.36 --> 6559.199
then those that remain have their

6556.96 --> 6562.159
spirits broken they will

6559.199 --> 6564.0
prevent the lie from coming out because

6562.159 --> 6565.839999999999
it's too much of a burden to them they

6564.0 --> 6569.119
will defend

6565.84 --> 6572.639
their murderers

6569.119 --> 6576.88
for the rest of their life

6572.639 --> 6579.52
keep it all going right

6576.88 --> 6581.4400000000005
too many people and too many mentally

6579.52 --> 6584.080000000001
stable people

6581.44 --> 6585.04
yeah that's that's a danger to satanic

6584.08 --> 6589.04
controllers they

6585.04 --> 6590.08
need people to be mentally scarred and

6589.04 --> 6593.119
tortured and have

6590.08 --> 6593.599
having seen people died while they still

6593.119 --> 6596.0
thought

6593.599 --> 6596.639
that the vaccine was a good thing they

6596.0 --> 6600.48
need

6596.639 --> 6604.0
that so that the people can then

6600.48 --> 6606.08
automatically turn to defending them

6604.0 --> 6608.639
the rest of their lives because they

6606.08 --> 6612.0
can't handle that they were scammed

6608.639 --> 6612.639
in such an atrocious evil way with so

6612.0 --> 6615.36
much

6612.639 --> 6616.159000000001
power and money influence to make that

6615.36 --> 6619.04
happen

6616.159 --> 6621.759999999999
it's too much to handle for the vast

6619.04 --> 6626.239
majority of people that get fooled by it

6621.76 --> 6639.84
that survive that's what they do

6626.239 --> 6639.839999999999
that's what you genesis do

6648.239 --> 6655.839999999999
all right i'm gonna run out the show now

6653.119 --> 6658.0
not the nicest of subjects to round out

6655.84 --> 6658.0
on

6659.119 --> 6665.598999999999
but i'm glad i was able to make

6663.44 --> 6667.119
proper statements there because it's all

6665.599 --> 6670.32
true everything i said

6667.119 --> 6673.598999999999
is true everything everything i said

6670.32 --> 6677.04
is true i stand by it

6673.599 --> 6677.599
the rest of my life the rest of my life

6677.04 --> 6680.239
i will

6677.599 --> 6681.92
never go back on it under any

6680.239 --> 6684.32
circumstances even if

6681.92 --> 6685.84
literally people threaten in that moment

6684.32 --> 6690.08
to execute me i will

6685.84 --> 6693.360000000001
never give into it ever

6690.08 --> 6695.92
it is the truth

6693.36 --> 6696.719
and nothing will make me change my

6695.92 --> 6700.159
stance on it

6696.719 --> 6702.08
ever again the rest of my life

6700.159 --> 6703.759999999999
even if it's a short life because of

6702.08 --> 6709.5199999999995
that i don't care i will

6703.76 --> 6713.1990000000005
