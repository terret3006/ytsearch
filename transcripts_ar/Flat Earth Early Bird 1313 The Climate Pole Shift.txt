great right today

115.439 --> 120.719
weather is

117.84 --> 120.71900000000001
magnificent

121.439 --> 125.27999999999999
it's a really beautiful sunday

125.84 --> 132.64000000000001
very blue sky sunny

128.72 --> 136.16
seems to be some trails of some kind

132.64 --> 136.16
out there up there but

137.36 --> 140.31900000000002
yeah not

141.52 --> 147.44
not overwhelmingly so

144.4 --> 149.12
look at those little sheep clouds

147.44 --> 150.879
up there weird

149.12 --> 152.31900000000002
but yeah most of it is still clear and

150.879 --> 153.67999999999998
blue and

152.319 --> 155.35999999999999
very sunny

153.68 --> 158.959
but on top of that there's like this

155.36 --> 161.44000000000003
constant wind and it's really nice

158.959 --> 163.76
because of that

161.44 --> 166.48
just sitting on the roof

163.76 --> 166.48
in the shadow

166.959 --> 170.72
and just with that wind it's just

168.72 --> 172.319
delightful

170.72 --> 175.519
as long as you're in the shadow i mean

172.319 --> 175.51899999999998
in the sun it's still hot

177.2 --> 182.959
right so overall a beautiful

180.48 --> 186.2
sunday afternoon here

182.959 --> 186.20000000000002
in uterex

193.78 --> 196.889
[Music]

201.12 --> 204.08
camera freeze

210.239 --> 214.4
right so hello flatter sage first in

212.56 --> 218.159
chat

214.4 --> 220.87900000000002
clutch mike's the dunich good to see you

218.159 --> 220.879
temperature

222.82 --> 226.07999999999998
[Music]

224.48 --> 229.29899999999998
28 degrees

226.08 --> 229.299
[Music]

231.28 --> 235.519
yeah it might become 29 so it's good

233.519 --> 238.0
yeah the

235.519 --> 239.68
it's another little sunny peak

238.0 --> 242.799
but i don't know

239.68 --> 242.799
like with the wind

243.36 --> 249.43900000000002
it's just really delightful it's not

245.92 --> 252.48
super humid either like 44 is

249.439 --> 252.48
less than it's been

253.519 --> 257.6
now yeah the prediction said the

255.68 --> 260.56
forecast says it's going to rain again

257.6 --> 263.12
monday and tuesday so

260.56 --> 264.4
but yeah this is just all great summer

263.12 --> 267.4
weather here

264.4 --> 267.4
really

273.28 --> 278.33
right anyway

276.16 --> 281.52000000000004
got some gusto and some

278.33 --> 284.479
[Music]

281.52 --> 284.479
rusty water

291.199 --> 294.199
ah

294.93 --> 301.36
[Music]

297.84 --> 301.35999999999996
cut up kind of early today

304.4 --> 308.84
but even had his fiesta before the show

307.84 --> 312.4
but

308.84 --> 314.32
like yeah i don't know very early i

312.4 --> 316.56
don't know i feel great i feel actually

314.32 --> 316.56
good

318.8 --> 320.96000000000004
so

321.759 --> 325.84000000000003
looking forward to the show

326.4 --> 330.56
been watching owen benjamin been

328.08 --> 332.71999999999997
catching up and there's been

330.56 --> 335.6
a lot of catching up to do because i

332.72 --> 339.84000000000003
basically hadn't watched all week

335.6 --> 339.84000000000003
and uh but it's interesting

345.68 --> 350.16
not picking up any distinct

347.44 --> 351.68
synchronicities but yeah

350.16 --> 354.56
i don't know

351.68 --> 356.56
those types of things go

354.56 --> 358.8
up and down as well

356.56 --> 361.12
but uh yeah this i mean with home

358.8 --> 363.36
benjamin is almost like you

361.12 --> 365.68
you're going to be looking out for that

363.36 --> 367.759
oh wait there was a weird video

365.68 --> 370.0
yesterday

367.759 --> 373.039
kind of a weird video

370.0 --> 375.36
over at quantum of conscious

373.039 --> 379.56
i think he might have been just kind of

375.36 --> 379.56
like troll poking a bit

380.24 --> 382.479
but

383.28 --> 387.039
he was basically sort of like

388.96 --> 392.15999999999997
doing a weird thing

393.44 --> 398.0
and confronting like feynman

399.52 --> 403.84
about he was basically criticizing

402.479 --> 406.24
criticizing

403.84 --> 408.96
the scientific method in a way but

406.24 --> 411.52
very haphazard and sloppily and

408.96 --> 414.15999999999997
cross-referencing it to his

411.52 --> 416.56
very metaphysical

414.16 --> 418.40000000000003
way of thinking but it's just i i had to

416.56 --> 421.759
write a comment a pretty elaborate

418.4 --> 423.67999999999995
comment would be nice if anybody

421.759 --> 426.16
would uh

423.68 --> 429.12
give it enough vote for some reason i

426.16 --> 431.759
have zero very weird i commented like

429.12 --> 435.52
immediately

431.759 --> 439.68
apparently people really disagree

435.52 --> 439.68
which i think is like really bizarre

440.08 --> 442.88
because

441.199 --> 446.84000000000003
yeah i thought that my

442.88 --> 446.84
comment was very sensible

450.479 --> 454.479
anyway here's this video like it was

452.56 --> 456.56
still an interesting video it was like

454.479 --> 458.88
an interesting challenge that's why i

456.56 --> 463.96
started out my comment with

458.88 --> 463.96
a noble but futile attempt matt

467.759 --> 470.0
right

475.199 --> 479.68
i find it

476.72 --> 481.44000000000005
slightly worrisome it's like really guys

479.68 --> 483.36
no

481.44 --> 485.28
you're not gonna nobody's gonna back me

483.36 --> 487.36
on this like over

485.28 --> 490.0
from the guys that typically follow his

487.36 --> 492.56
channel like what

490.0 --> 494.72
everybody's gonna take like his weird

492.56 --> 497.36
attitude and

494.72 --> 500.08000000000004
his arguments just

497.36 --> 500.08000000000004
just like that

502.56 --> 506.639
or just everybody thought it was a joke

504.479 --> 509.68
and nobody wanted to take it serious i

506.639 --> 509.68
don't know what's going on

513.36 --> 516.64
hello x320

517.279 --> 520.599
by the way

529.519 --> 535.24
right so anyways his was like a 30

531.519 --> 535.24
minute video and

537.44 --> 543.9200000000001
i don't want to review my comments

541.12 --> 546.88
i mean i spent uh

543.92 --> 549.8389999999999
like half an hour overall like refining

546.88 --> 549.8389999999999
it

565.36 --> 569.279
let's see i'm gonna do that

568.399 --> 572.88
just

569.279 --> 572.88
i just kind of want to show it

574.64 --> 578.959
i might read it out

576.48 --> 578.9590000000001
alone

585.92 --> 590.04
ah

587.04 --> 590.04
perfect

601.6 --> 605.279
i did have a couple of replies but none

603.76 --> 608.959
of them

605.279 --> 608.959
seem to be all that serious

611.44 --> 613.839
anyway

613.92 --> 617.24
here it is

618.56 --> 622.88
see how can i read that

621.12 --> 624.9590000000001
i'm gonna try to read it from the

622.88 --> 625.92
youtube screen

624.959 --> 627.76
because

625.92 --> 631.36
you can never read that

627.76 --> 632.399
then why would i even do this

631.36 --> 634.88
uh

632.399 --> 634.88
let's see

636.48 --> 641.44
the resolution

638.88 --> 645.88
that does help

641.44 --> 645.8800000000001
i can read it here at 7 20.

648.0 --> 652.64
and yeah when i full screen it it's very

650.16 --> 654.56
easy to read

652.64 --> 657.92
right and no whoa

654.56 --> 660.399
a noble but futile attempt matt

657.92 --> 661.519
baineman was not impervious to inside

660.399 --> 663.839
error

661.519 --> 667.2
but he was probably the most cohesive

663.839 --> 670.9590000000001
structural thinker of the last century

667.2 --> 672.5600000000001
her metaphysical axioms have no place in

670.959 --> 674.16
physics

672.56 --> 677.1999999999999
i think that uh

674.16 --> 678.64
a lot of the guys at fed would agree to

677.2 --> 680.72
that

678.64 --> 683.68
the claim of light being this giant

680.72 --> 685.76
spectrum outside the site matt have you

683.68 --> 688.16
ever considered that this might be based

685.76 --> 690.88
on presuppositional science fiction

688.16 --> 690.88
horseshit

691.279 --> 695.68
right because that is worth considering

693.519 --> 698.16
i've seen that sort of thing happen all

695.68 --> 701.4399999999999
the time it's like oh the scientists

698.16 --> 705.1999999999999
they just want this one universal thing

701.44 --> 707.519
the one formula right so oh light yeah

705.2 --> 710.639
it's this spectrum it's so far outside

707.519 --> 712.32
of sight i think that that

710.639 --> 715.279
notion

712.32 --> 717.9200000000001
is highly presuppositional and just like

715.279 --> 720.639
they technically don't even fully un

717.92 --> 724.0
anyway let me continue the comment

720.639 --> 724.0
getting myself going again

724.639 --> 727.6
right

725.68 --> 730.079
science fiction horseshit

727.6 --> 732.639
these quantum mechanics physicists could

730.079 --> 735.92
barely figure out what light actually is

732.639 --> 737.839
for crying out loud and this is true

735.92 --> 740.4799999999999
yeah of course now people like kiwi

737.839 --> 742.9590000000001
don't want to say that

740.48 --> 746.48
but look what came out of it universal

742.959 --> 750.079
misunderstanding and it's not just a

746.48 --> 751.44
particle and that solves it all

750.079 --> 754.079
right

751.44 --> 756.8000000000001
light is not like matter it's not a

754.079 --> 761.76
particle like matter it's more like the

756.8 --> 764.4799999999999
particle a quantum is a convention

761.76 --> 767.04
and it's not it's arbitrarily picked

764.48 --> 770.0
based on a certain interaction with

767.04 --> 774.56
material now this is

770.0 --> 774.56
of course my little test

774.72 --> 778.5600000000001
relating to the test of the nature of

776.48 --> 780.32
light and a lot of you guys know about

778.56 --> 782.3199999999999
this

780.32 --> 783.9200000000001
let me continue

782.32 --> 786.399
overall in this video you seem to

783.92 --> 788.7199999999999
display a vast misunderstanding of what

786.399 --> 791.6
the word experiment

788.72 --> 794.1600000000001
within physics truly implies

791.6 --> 796.639
it is about the varying and manipulating

794.16 --> 799.519
of an independent variable which has to

796.639 --> 802.399
be a naturally occurring phenomenon to

799.519 --> 805.68
establish the cause of an effect

802.399 --> 806.959
all other things outside of it are not

805.68 --> 809.92
relevant

806.959 --> 811.1999999999999
the experiment exclusively

809.92 --> 813.36
focuses

811.2 --> 815.9200000000001
on the presumed to be cause of the

813.36 --> 819.12
effect other experiments could prove

815.92 --> 822.24
other causes or other

819.12 --> 824.32
could prove other causes of other or the

822.24 --> 826.9590000000001
same effect also einstein was a

824.32 --> 829.839
mathematical fantasies not case

826.959 --> 833.279
right now i thought

829.839 --> 833.2790000000001
it's a pretty epic comment

833.92 --> 839.04
did not seem to yield

836.639 --> 842.04
a single upvote

839.04 --> 842.04
though

843.6 --> 846.0
weird

850.16 --> 855.959
anyway i don't know if anybody cares

852.72 --> 855.9590000000001
i care

862.24 --> 867.04
i mean i i do respect quantum of

865.04 --> 868.0
conscious

867.04 --> 870.48
yes

868.0 --> 871.519
very interesting cohesive

870.48 --> 874.8000000000001
thinking

871.519 --> 875.76
that reaches into this surreal and still

874.8 --> 879.68
like

875.76 --> 881.68
tackle some highly elusive concepts

879.68 --> 884.7199999999999
what's the response

881.68 --> 887.68
well there wasn't any really

884.72 --> 888.639
it was just a bunch of guys

887.68 --> 890.88
saying

888.639 --> 890.88
like

893.199 --> 899.5999999999999
just not really a response

895.519 --> 902.24
like one guy said i have an abacus

899.6 --> 905.36
whatever and then okay

902.24 --> 909.199
dick fling hammer structure thinking

905.36 --> 910.16
itself is a governor to abstract

909.199 --> 914.3199999999999
thought

910.16 --> 916.8
which is creative as opposed to systemic

914.32 --> 919.44
adherence to rule of finite

916.8 --> 920.959
understandings respectfully

919.44 --> 924.24
in other words

920.959 --> 926.56
philosophical technobabble blabbering

924.24 --> 928.5600000000001
i mean seriously that literally doesn't

926.56 --> 930.7199999999999
mean anything

928.56 --> 933.04
or at least it is not a relevant

930.72 --> 934.48
response to anything that i mentioned

933.04 --> 936.959
right

934.48 --> 939.04
i wasn't making some you general

936.959 --> 943.5189999999999
philosophical statement i was trying to

939.04 --> 947.199
say look physics works different

943.519 --> 948.48
it is very narrow it's just the freaking

947.199 --> 951.279
earthly

948.48 --> 952.9590000000001
and it's a miracle like information and

951.279 --> 955.519
the supernatural can already be

952.959 --> 958.2399999999999
identified in the first instance right

955.519 --> 961.759
that doesn't mean that oh so then all

958.24 --> 963.92
your existential metaphysical oversight

961.759 --> 967.04
through the spirit and the mind

963.92 --> 970.24
that means physics is all [ __ ] no

967.04 --> 972.0
it's not it doesn't work that way

970.24 --> 975.04
it really doesn't

972.0 --> 977.36
and just because when you unleash

975.04 --> 980.8389999999999
the high level of metaphysical thinking

977.36 --> 983.519
onto the basics of the scientific

980.839 --> 986.48
experiment and you get all these wild

983.519 --> 989.199
ideas about yeah but our our idea is

986.48 --> 991.36
making it and the universe is responding

989.199 --> 994.16
and it's just trying to show us a

991.36 --> 999.6800000000001
cohesion and it's a trick that's all

994.16 --> 999.68
just complete irrelevant horseshit

1000.24 --> 1006.0
it's like it doesn't matter

1003.519 --> 1008.88
at all like the experiment it's not

1006.0 --> 1011.92
about that it it is just about the cause

1008.88 --> 1014.959
of an effect you very manipulated within

1011.92 --> 1017.92
the physical realm as the experimenter

1014.959 --> 1018.959
and establish if it causes a physical

1017.92 --> 1020.079
change

1018.959 --> 1021.279
basically

1020.079 --> 1023.3599999999999
and

1021.279 --> 1027.12
all that other metaphysical stuff is

1023.36 --> 1027.1200000000001
just completely irrelevant

1027.28 --> 1030.079
so

1028.079 --> 1032.1599999999999
i basically thought that quantum of

1030.079 --> 1035.1989999999998
consciousness video and supposed

1032.16 --> 1037.52
argument to feynman although he did sort

1035.199 --> 1040.64
of jokingly but it was effectively a

1037.52 --> 1040.6399999999999
giant straw man

1042.24 --> 1045.52
and yeah

1043.919 --> 1048.48
anyway

1045.52 --> 1048.48
if hey nathan

1050.559 --> 1056.559
good to see you yeah this i was trying

1053.12 --> 1060.6399999999999
to draw this the attention to this in

1056.559 --> 1060.6399999999999
in skype 2 no response

1061.919 --> 1065.76
i mean this guy

1063.36 --> 1068.3999999999999
doesn't usually talk about flat earth

1065.76 --> 1068.4
all that much

1069.76 --> 1075.679
but he he knows the globe earth is

1071.84 --> 1075.6789999999999
[ __ ] he does reference that a lot

1077.2 --> 1082.48
but this is like one of the first times

1078.88 --> 1086.5590000000002
he like sort of gave it a go against the

1082.48 --> 1089.84
established order of science and

1086.559 --> 1091.76
like in the the early days when it was

1089.84 --> 1095.4399999999998
pretty decent still

1091.76 --> 1098.72
what was happening anyway

1095.44 --> 1101.76
is that the link to the video yes

1098.72 --> 1104.559
tara 306 quantum of consciousness video

1101.76 --> 1104.559
from yesterday

1104.88 --> 1109.5200000000002
i just i made it

1108.08 --> 1112.3999999999999
a comment

1109.52 --> 1113.76
it would be cool if i got some other

1112.4 --> 1116.4
replies

1113.76 --> 1118.16
and hey even if you i was wrong about

1116.4 --> 1121.52
something or you know you can be

1118.16 --> 1124.4
nitpicky in your response to me as well

1121.52 --> 1126.559
i'm fine with that

1124.4 --> 1128.96
but i did i really did do my best to

1126.559 --> 1130.559
just write a very decent

1128.96 --> 1133.559
comment

1130.559 --> 1133.559
anyway

1155.679 --> 1159.44
right but what i noticed was there's

1157.52 --> 1161.2
other comments too

1159.44 --> 1163.6000000000001
i mean quantum of conscious gets a lot

1161.2 --> 1166.0800000000002
of comments

1163.6 --> 1168.9599999999998
it's a lot of creative thinking people

1166.08 --> 1170.799
that like to comment

1168.96 --> 1172.559
and he responds to those comments

1170.799 --> 1173.52
sometimes

1172.559 --> 1176.08
and

1173.52 --> 1178.16
yeah i mean his comment section has

1176.08 --> 1179.4399999999998
plenty of comments and all kinds of

1178.16 --> 1181.44
upvotes he

1179.44 --> 1184.16
responded here and there

1181.44 --> 1186.96
mine's got zero and i'm like

1184.16 --> 1186.96
that's weird

1187.12 --> 1189.9189999999999
what's going on

1191.12 --> 1198.36
i mean did i say something bad

1195.36 --> 1198.36
really

1220.4 --> 1224.5590000000002
or maybe i was just too mind-blowing or

1222.72 --> 1226.88
something and everybody's just giving it

1224.559 --> 1229.36
the silent treatment because their fear

1226.88 --> 1231.7600000000002
like if i if they give in to it if they

1229.36 --> 1234.0
give recognition that i'll just

1231.76 --> 1235.84
get even more like that and like burn

1234.0 --> 1239.12
everybody out

1235.84 --> 1241.1999999999998
i don't know what how that works

1239.12 --> 1244.2399999999998
sometimes i just don't get why i don't

1241.2 --> 1248.28
get any kind of interaction

1244.24 --> 1248.28
i really don't get it

1252.559 --> 1258.799
i mean

1254.48 --> 1258.799
i do i don't have like this

1259.28 --> 1266.1589999999999
repulsive thing on me right

1262.64 --> 1269.679
i mean i get a lot of like good feedback

1266.159 --> 1269.679
from you guys especially

1271.76 --> 1275.44
so i'd like

1273.36 --> 1279.6
could that be youtube kind of like

1275.44 --> 1282.159
shadow banning cornering me there or

1279.6 --> 1284.48
or did matt just like think i was a

1282.159 --> 1284.48
troll

1284.559 --> 1289.36
no i can't that makes no sense

1287.44 --> 1290.4
it's just i don't understand

1289.36 --> 1291.84
such things

1290.4 --> 1293.919
maybe they're just screwing with the

1291.84 --> 1296.08
numbers trying to gaslight maybe youtube

1293.919 --> 1299.1200000000001
is trying to gaslight me

1296.08 --> 1301.4399999999998
through even through votes in comments i

1299.12 --> 1303.6789999999999
don't know how far they take it you know

1301.44 --> 1307.3600000000001
they they've screwed with the

1303.679 --> 1310.0800000000002
the vote numbers like very visibly

1307.36 --> 1311.039
right it's been very visible that they

1310.08 --> 1313.52
do that

1311.039 --> 1316.24
so maybe they even do that sort of

1313.52 --> 1318.48
shitty thing in just comments

1316.24 --> 1321.679
just like oh no no nobody liked your

1318.48 --> 1324.559
comment yeah maybe 20 50 people voted up

1321.679 --> 1327.44
but no we're literally erasing that now

1324.559 --> 1329.6
making it unable to register or maybe

1327.44 --> 1331.6000000000001
they just did it to me maybe you guys

1329.6 --> 1333.36
can actually see up votes there i don't

1331.6 --> 1338.6
know i don't know what the hell is going

1333.36 --> 1338.6
on anymore man with this i really don't

1346.4 --> 1351.6000000000001
smart people are unsure what i'm saying

1349.52 --> 1355.679
but really clutch

1351.6 --> 1360.0
i mean was everything i said that much

1355.679 --> 1363.039
was it that far outside of the

1360.0 --> 1364.72
sort of average

1363.039 --> 1366.0
intellectual

1364.72 --> 1368.48
grounds

1366.0 --> 1371.679
was it so far out there i don't think so

1368.48 --> 1374.559
i mean look at how how matt talks dude

1371.679 --> 1377.039
he takes like very raw metaphysical

1374.559 --> 1380.72
concepts and just standardizes it in his

1377.039 --> 1380.72
vocabulary just like that

1381.12 --> 1385.84
right

1383.28 --> 1387.44
he does that a lot and he does it very

1385.84 --> 1388.72
unapologetically

1387.44 --> 1391.679
so

1388.72 --> 1391.679
i don't yeah

1393.76 --> 1400.44
i mean mine was very

1396.08 --> 1400.4399999999998
concise and to the point

1404.32 --> 1408.48
no comment that i could see what

1412.88 --> 1416.5200000000002
what really

1420.4 --> 1423.279
holy [ __ ]

1424.0 --> 1427.279
okay

1425.679 --> 1430.4
you couldn't see it

1427.279 --> 1433.84
at all

1430.4 --> 1436.5590000000002
that's [ __ ] freaky

1433.84 --> 1439.4399999999998
i think i'm gonna delete it and repost

1436.559 --> 1439.44
it right now

1442.48 --> 1446.24
maybe he was kind of freaked out by the

1444.48 --> 1449.52
editing because i've been editing it

1446.24 --> 1451.679
like a lot in like half an hour time

1449.52 --> 1454.1589999999999
i was very quick with the response but

1451.679 --> 1456.88
maybe he just like

1454.159 --> 1456.88
somebody got

1456.96 --> 1461.279
freaked out i don't know it's stupid if

1458.96 --> 1464.96
they just don't even know who i am

1461.279 --> 1464.96
by now that's just stupid

1466.32 --> 1469.039
try again

1471.36 --> 1478.08
okay i just reposted my comments nathan

1474.96 --> 1478.08
can you check again

1479.279 --> 1483.36
thank you by the way for actually

1480.96 --> 1484.72
checking that would explain i might have

1483.36 --> 1489.1999999999998
been

1484.72 --> 1489.2
shadow oh whoa i got an immediate upload

1490.159 --> 1493.5590000000002
that was quick

1505.84 --> 1512.08
right i think it might have been youtube

1507.919 --> 1512.0800000000002
maybe it was youtube i know that

1512.32 --> 1517.6
matt has been describing like the system

1515.6 --> 1520.24
of that surrounding him is trying to

1517.6 --> 1521.9189999999999
[ __ ] with him a lot at times

1520.24 --> 1524.64
kind of like with me but with him

1521.919 --> 1527.1200000000001
probably even worse

1524.64 --> 1528.96
and maybe they did it

1527.12 --> 1533.039
they

1528.96 --> 1533.039
they made my comment invisible

1533.84 --> 1538.0
they it was they

1535.919 --> 1542.5200000000002
anyhow i reposted it and yeah i

1538.0 --> 1542.52
immediately got an up vote so

1543.76 --> 1548.64
thanks for the rogan's up clutch

1546.32 --> 1550.799
but you guys did see it right

1548.64 --> 1554.3200000000002
i did just literally put it on the

1550.799 --> 1558.559
screen you could that was just my

1554.32 --> 1560.8799999999999
my fire so it was visible to me

1558.559 --> 1560.8799999999999
um

1567.12 --> 1572.32
maybe some shadow operator just moved

1569.76 --> 1575.44
into his account and just like

1572.32 --> 1577.6
hid from channeled me

1575.44 --> 1580.64
oh by the way

1577.6 --> 1582.8799999999999
that never works when i use it when i'm

1580.64 --> 1585.44
moderating my comment section like they

1582.88 --> 1587.679
always keep showing back up those same

1585.44 --> 1590.559
people

1587.679 --> 1593.76
like oh hi this guide user from channel

1590.559 --> 1598.48
oh then i'm finally all the troll no

1593.76 --> 1601.279
next day he just comments again

1598.48 --> 1604.96
maybe that function is specifically for

1601.279 --> 1605.919
shadow operators maybe it only works

1604.96 --> 1610.08
when

1605.919 --> 1611.44
applied not from your account

1610.08 --> 1614.6399999999999
i don't know

1611.44 --> 1614.64
getting kind of silly now

1623.279 --> 1627.32
very boring well nathan

1629.12 --> 1633.52
it's not it's not been his best video

1631.36 --> 1635.9189999999999
but in this case it was relevant because

1633.52 --> 1639.36
he was literally just saying look you

1635.919 --> 1642.24
science guys you don't understand

1639.36 --> 1643.76
like it makes no sense to anchor all

1642.24 --> 1645.84
this

1643.76 --> 1647.919
like this value this

1645.84 --> 1650.8799999999999
grounding

1647.919 --> 1653.5200000000002
cornerstone weight on the scientific

1650.88 --> 1656.3200000000002
method when obviously the world is

1653.52 --> 1657.039
flexible or something and the mind and

1656.32 --> 1660.32
the

1657.039 --> 1663.12
spirit is what is manifesting things

1660.32 --> 1664.6399999999999
sort of supposedly according to quantum

1663.12 --> 1666.9599999999998
physics

1664.64 --> 1669.919
right that sort of trainer thinking it's

1666.96 --> 1672.159
what he does a lot

1669.919 --> 1674.24
he gets metaphysical

1672.159 --> 1677.0390000000002
but in this case i just really noted

1674.24 --> 1679.84
like you're saying this you literally do

1677.039 --> 1682.72
not understand the scientific method

1679.84 --> 1684.8799999999999
it's not just a game

1682.72 --> 1687.6000000000001
there's a very distinct reason why it is

1684.88 --> 1690.5590000000002
the way it is and like you really gotta

1687.6 --> 1692.559
learn it and focus on like all the

1690.559 --> 1694.559
different levels

1692.559 --> 1697.6789999999999
the words

1694.559 --> 1699.84
and the reasons

1697.679 --> 1702.799
and then

1699.84 --> 1704.9599999999998
you'll get it like every detail matters

1702.799 --> 1708.399
it's not just something that was like

1704.96 --> 1708.3990000000001
determined arbitrarily

1708.72 --> 1712.96
and i don't think that matt

1710.799 --> 1715.279
quantum conscious at the moment is

1712.96 --> 1718.96
getting that or at least

1715.279 --> 1722.32
if i take his video literal

1718.96 --> 1722.32
seems that he's just like

1722.88 --> 1727.1200000000001
didn't really like it or something maybe

1725.279 --> 1730.32
he's been trying to follow the flat

1727.12 --> 1732.08
earth debate and he just didn't like it

1730.32 --> 1734.399
huh

1732.08 --> 1736.48
i mean not everybody likes it

1734.399 --> 1738.9599999999998
jim bob has followed it and he liked it

1736.48 --> 1740.96
and he totally assimilated a whole bunch

1738.96 --> 1742.08
of

1740.96 --> 1745.039
stable

1742.08 --> 1746.8799999999999
well thought out trains of thinking and

1745.039 --> 1748.32
systems from it

1746.88 --> 1750.5590000000002
maybe quite

1748.32 --> 1753.2
matt took a look and he didn't like it

1750.559 --> 1756.52
and this was his response

1753.2 --> 1756.52
i don't know

1766.32 --> 1768.799
anyhow

1770.96 --> 1774.559
take a look

1772.399 --> 1776.799
at the video if you like

1774.559 --> 1776.799
ah

1779.039 --> 1782.1589999999999
ah you commented too nice nathan thanks

1781.039 --> 1785.919
for that

1782.159 --> 1785.919
and yeah i got up four of quotes

1792.399 --> 1798.0
all right yeah i guess i i i guess my

1795.36 --> 1799.6789999999999
comment was shadow band then but it

1798.0 --> 1802.399
wasn't deleted

1799.679 --> 1805.039
right i showed it to you it was right

1802.399 --> 1807.6
presented it

1805.039 --> 1810.32
it was just not visible for others

1807.6 --> 1812.8799999999999
or after a certain point it wasn't

1810.32 --> 1815.6
anymore because i did have a couple of

1812.88 --> 1819.3200000000002
responses so somebody

1815.6 --> 1819.32
shadow banned it

1828.159 --> 1831.919
hey gordzilla

1830.159 --> 1835.159
by the way and yeah fiber oats good to

1831.919 --> 1835.159
see you

1838.72 --> 1841.039
right

1844.88 --> 1847.279
look

1846.24 --> 1849.84
i'm just

1847.279 --> 1852.399
keeping an eye out for people

1849.84 --> 1856.72
that i find to be

1852.399 --> 1856.7199999999998
valuable and morally stable enough

1857.519 --> 1862.72
and especially cohesive enough cohesion

1860.08 --> 1864.559
is everything i'm looking around

1862.72 --> 1866.88
and i'm paying attention to what they're

1864.559 --> 1867.9189999999999
doing

1866.88 --> 1871.0390000000002
and then

1867.919 --> 1873.3600000000001
because sort of i am a bit of a diplomat

1871.039 --> 1876.1589999999999
for flat earth and flat earth debate i

1873.36 --> 1878.32
get that's just what i do

1876.159 --> 1879.3600000000001
so when i pick up on these types of

1878.32 --> 1881.6
details

1879.36 --> 1884.799
it's very important to me

1881.6 --> 1886.799
and i put in a lot of effort

1884.799 --> 1888.72
to communicate something like it's

1886.799 --> 1891.72
really important because to me it is

1888.72 --> 1891.72
important

1893.519 --> 1897.679
because these types of communications

1895.679 --> 1900.5590000000002
really matter you see

1897.679 --> 1902.72
if somebody's just blabbering around and

1900.559 --> 1904.559
getting it wrong well you might really

1902.72 --> 1906.32
like them

1904.559 --> 1908.08
on their other video but if you just get

1906.32 --> 1911.039
it really wrong and you don't say

1908.08 --> 1912.08
anything about it if you don't help him

1911.039 --> 1914.64
or her

1912.08 --> 1916.72
we're trying to correct it as politely

1914.64 --> 1917.919
as possible

1916.72 --> 1920.559
then

1917.919 --> 1923.039
they are gonna keep drifting away

1920.559 --> 1926.1589999999999
they're not gonna

1923.039 --> 1926.1589999999999
correct it probably

1926.399 --> 1929.4799999999998
all right

1940.24 --> 1945.919
right but anyway nathan i agree that

1942.559 --> 1947.84
that video wasn't his best one

1945.919 --> 1950.0
but he still watched all the way through

1947.84 --> 1952.1589999999999
because it was very relevant

1950.0 --> 1955.12
and i wanted to see

1952.159 --> 1957.44
where he was going to go

1955.12 --> 1958.8799999999999
how he was going to basically reify his

1957.44 --> 1961.3600000000001
argument

1958.88 --> 1963.7600000000002
reify what straw man was he gonna

1961.36 --> 1964.9599999999998
present

1963.76 --> 1966.799
and not

1964.96 --> 1968.88
from the perspective of an anti-flat

1966.799 --> 1971.36
earther because he is definitely not

1968.88 --> 1971.3600000000001
like that

1972.159 --> 1978.3200000000002
and it seemed like everything he said

1974.399 --> 1981.799
was basically his honest

1978.32 --> 1981.799
train of thinking

1990.799 --> 1993.279
anyhow

1994.559 --> 1997.6
so that happened

2001.36 --> 2006.559
oh yeah beyond the imaginary curve dell

2004.48 --> 2008.0
had a live show

2006.559 --> 2010.96
it was great

2008.0 --> 2010.96
very entertaining

2012.96 --> 2017.1200000000001
got a bit fired up always good when it

2015.279 --> 2019.84
happens

2017.12 --> 2019.84
uh

2027.6 --> 2033.1999999999998
right other than that it was a

2029.919 --> 2038.039
pretty laid back saturday evening and

2033.2 --> 2038.039
all that didn't go to bed too late

2052.159 --> 2055.599
yo guys

2054.079 --> 2058.3990000000003
this is

2055.599 --> 2061.839
four minutes of silence

2058.399 --> 2061.839
thank you for that

2062.8 --> 2066.8390000000004
you were all chatty before

2083.679 --> 2087.52
how it is he can see mercury in the

2086.32 --> 2090.159
night sky

2087.52 --> 2093.44
was that mercury because there was a

2090.159 --> 2096.8
very peculiar star out

2093.44 --> 2100.599
i kind of thought it was venus but

2096.8 --> 2100.599
you say that was mercury

2104.72 --> 2108.2799999999997
what's that link

2118.8 --> 2124.32
oh great thanks for the link that

2121.599 --> 2127.28
literally does not give you an option to

2124.32 --> 2130.92
not accept the cookies thanks derrick

2127.28 --> 2130.92
that's just great

2133.119 --> 2137.0
i'm not gonna do that

2161.839 --> 2164.16
oh

2168.32 --> 2172.599
okay gortilla right

2182.24 --> 2188.0789999999997
but there was i think a planet visible

2185.44 --> 2189.839
yesterday it was just

2188.079 --> 2194.04
what's that

2189.839 --> 2194.04
no wait that's two days ago

2206.4 --> 2210.079
because i yeah remember i had the weird

2208.88 --> 2210.88
sleeping

2210.079 --> 2211.599
yeah

2210.88 --> 2212.48
i

2211.599 --> 2215.52
dab

2212.48 --> 2218.16
poison myself on sugar through candy

2215.52 --> 2220.48
silly situation and then

2218.16 --> 2222.0789999999997
had a really early sleep and then woke

2220.48 --> 2223.92
up almost

2222.079 --> 2227.04
yeah in the middle of the night and then

2223.92 --> 2228.64
stayed up till the morning pretty much

2227.04 --> 2230.079
but i did see you

2228.64 --> 2232.48
like

2230.079 --> 2234.32
before the sun came up before it it

2232.48 --> 2235.44
started the daylight started to really

2234.32 --> 2237.44
break

2235.44 --> 2238.7200000000003
was just this moon sickle that was

2237.44 --> 2242.56
visible

2238.72 --> 2243.52
and behind it

2242.56 --> 2246.96
was

2243.52 --> 2246.96
well it might be

2247.04 --> 2250.8
venus

2248.24 --> 2254.56
but the way it looked

2250.8 --> 2258.48
it just looked like it was this weird

2254.56 --> 2260.64
like fiery ball or something

2258.48 --> 2262.8
and yeah not a ball

2260.64 --> 2262.7999999999997
like

2264.64 --> 2267.04
i

2265.17 --> 2269.6800000000003
[Music]

2267.04 --> 2272.16
because it's like it plays tricks on the

2269.68 --> 2274.7999999999997
eyes like it is a non-local hologram but

2272.16 --> 2274.7999999999997
it's just like

2275.359 --> 2279.4
my eye is giving me some really weird

2278.32 --> 2282.32
kind of

2279.4 --> 2284.4
physicality assumptions about what i'm

2282.32 --> 2286.6400000000003
seeing there

2284.4 --> 2288.56
so it's almost like this

2286.64 --> 2291.1189999999997
fiery claw

2288.56 --> 2293.52
but i i don't know

2291.119 --> 2295.6800000000003
how to express like what that looked

2293.52 --> 2297.52
like

2295.68 --> 2301.68
definitely didn't look like a little

2297.52 --> 2301.68
ball that was reflecting light

2302.079 --> 2309.32
it didn't look like a really big star

2305.119 --> 2309.32
it just had this weird

2309.64 --> 2312.79
[Music]

2315.2 --> 2318.56
i don't know how to express it

2318.88 --> 2325.1600000000003
i mean freaking non-local holographics

2321.359 --> 2325.16
guys it's weird

2328.32 --> 2332.119
yeah reality

2340.079 --> 2345.6800000000003
still very entrenched into space yeah

2343.52 --> 2348.079
well it is a great thing to imagine

2345.68 --> 2348.0789999999997
isn't it

2348.16 --> 2351.2
i mean

2349.119 --> 2352.839
you got all these weird non-local

2351.2 --> 2354.7999999999997
holographic

2352.839 --> 2357.359
celestials

2354.8 --> 2359.8390000000004
and they're already kind of like playing

2357.359 --> 2361.2
tricks with your physicality assumption

2359.839 --> 2363.44
systems

2361.2 --> 2365.7599999999998
right the intermittent process between

2363.44 --> 2368.4
your eyes and your brain

2365.76 --> 2369.76
it's kind of already weirding that out

2368.4 --> 2371.839
just because of the non-local

2369.76 --> 2372.88
holographic nature

2371.839 --> 2376.0
and so

2372.88 --> 2377.76
if you then like want to make a dream

2376.0 --> 2379.839
out of it where you certainly see

2377.76 --> 2382.0
yourself like on a ball

2379.839 --> 2384.0789999999997
in between an infinite space and all

2382.0 --> 2385.839
these lights are actually really big

2384.079 --> 2386.8
objects yeah

2385.839 --> 2389.2799999999997
well

2386.8 --> 2391.04
it's not that hard to like

2389.28 --> 2392.96
do that

2391.04 --> 2394.96
with the data

2392.96 --> 2397.2
to add that on

2394.96 --> 2398.0
the presuppose and to envision it like

2397.2 --> 2401.04
that

2398.0 --> 2401.04
it's very dreamy

2401.119 --> 2405.76
but i guess that some people get really

2403.44 --> 2407.839
addicted to it and then they can't let

2405.76 --> 2409.92
go let that go anymore especially if

2407.839 --> 2412.24
they get older and they've been doing it

2409.92 --> 2415.36
all their lives

2412.24 --> 2415.3599999999997
[Music]

2422.4 --> 2427.599
hello jarvis and elise g good to see you

2430.56 --> 2434.96
northern lights were out last night

2432.64 --> 2434.96
really

2435.44 --> 2438.44
huh

2445.2 --> 2451.16
rapid fire lightning whoa where was that

2447.92 --> 2451.16
five roads

2462.48 --> 2466.52
minnesota oh right

2467.839 --> 2470.839
interesting

2525.28 --> 2529.44
right but was it fiber out was it is

2527.44 --> 2532.079
like

2529.44 --> 2534.56
just a lightning storm after

2532.079 --> 2538.4
a hot dry day

2534.56 --> 2538.4
or is it raining now there or

2542.64 --> 2547.92
was it like just a lightning storm and

2544.96 --> 2547.92
just nothing else

2548.319 --> 2551.839
that would be weird

2557.2 --> 2560.52
well cleary

2566.079 --> 2571.119
brian's logic did a great presentation

2567.92 --> 2571.119
on sexton yeah yeah

2571.44 --> 2575.839
it's all very technical though but yeah

2573.76 --> 2578.079
he's been doing great

2575.839 --> 2580.4
great small present the small ones are

2578.079 --> 2580.4
better

2581.68 --> 2584.9199999999996
but yeah

2594.96 --> 2600.88
hello george sanford

2596.96 --> 2600.88
greenstorms what are you talking about

2602.16 --> 2605.16
what

2641.52 --> 2646.319
that fiber outside was still asking you

2643.68 --> 2646.319
a question

2646.64 --> 2653.2799999999997
like was it an actual rainstorm

2650.319 --> 2653.2799999999997
is it raining now

2653.76 --> 2658.8390000000004
or was it like a dry

2655.839 --> 2658.839
lightning

2669.2 --> 2673.24
korean clown what

2676.0 --> 2678.319
what

2681.44 --> 2685.2000000000003
what do you mean green clouds

2686.0 --> 2691.839
did you actually see that with your own

2687.76 --> 2691.8390000000004
eyes or on some video

2711.839 --> 2714.839
hmm

2731.04 --> 2734.16
green clouds okay

2735.04 --> 2741.68
they weren't like emerald green right

2738.079 --> 2744.7200000000003
it's more like greenish

2741.68 --> 2747.359
because i've seen like massive

2744.72 --> 2750.9599999999996
billowings like super

2747.359 --> 2753.119
super tense like black giant

2750.96 --> 2755.68
storm rain clouds

2753.119 --> 2758.079
that would like literally have buckets

2755.68 --> 2760.48
falling out of them once

2758.079 --> 2764.319
you hit that exact zone

2760.48 --> 2766.64
that would be so vast and surrounded by

2764.319 --> 2768.72
like a perfect blue sky

2766.64 --> 2770.72
that there would be all kinds of weird

2768.72 --> 2771.7599999999998
light effects

2770.72 --> 2774.0
like

2771.76 --> 2776.079
when for example light would shine

2774.0 --> 2778.24
partially through it and like the cloud

2776.079 --> 2779.599
could even have like several different

2778.24 --> 2781.2
layers

2779.599 --> 2784.0
that were completely different because

2781.2 --> 2787.4399999999996
it was just so gigantic

2784.0 --> 2791.119
and all kinds of weird color effects

2787.44 --> 2792.88
i mean nothing like truly prismatic

2791.119 --> 2795.119
although

2792.88 --> 2797.2000000000003
like surrounding it because it was still

2795.119 --> 2798.48
such a blue clear blue sky and rain

2797.2 --> 2801.359
would like

2798.48 --> 2804.4
you would see rain

2801.359 --> 2804.4
falling out of it

2805.04 --> 2810.48
and then still like the sun in a clear

2807.839 --> 2812.319
blue sky right next to it so all kinds

2810.48 --> 2813.68
of weird sides but

2812.319 --> 2817.359
i'm trying to figure out what you

2813.68 --> 2819.359
exactly mean like is it like an unusual

2817.359 --> 2820.24
like green color

2819.359 --> 2822.56
light

2820.24 --> 2825.1189999999997
like an actual green light that somehow

2822.56 --> 2827.839
m a emanates within it

2825.119 --> 2831.839
or is it more like a

2827.839 --> 2831.839
just distorted color effect

2832.46 --> 2835.67
[Music]

2838.319 --> 2840.64
what

2840.72 --> 2844.04
oh godzilla

2846.0 --> 2849.52
not admiral green okay

2852.48 --> 2857.04
yeah quantum of conscious by the way is

2854.4 --> 2861.119
obsessed with that color it has a

2857.04 --> 2861.119
extreme significance apparently

2862.4 --> 2869.8
within his occult studies

2866.079 --> 2869.8
that's why i asked

2875.68 --> 2879.3999999999996
right

2876.31 --> 2879.4
[Music]

2884.96 --> 2889.599
astral light is green

2886.8 --> 2891.119
well northern light is green

2889.599 --> 2893.119
so

2891.119 --> 2896.6400000000003
yeah clutch you're like a pretty

2893.119 --> 2896.6400000000003
northern province right

2897.28 --> 2901.8390000000004
in the united

2898.839 --> 2902.88
states well

2901.839 --> 2905.52
maybe

2902.88 --> 2907.04
you're already seeing like a pole shift

2905.52 --> 2909.7599999999998
effect

2907.04 --> 2912.24
right because i've suspected that

2909.76 --> 2915.0400000000004
in like the last

2912.24 --> 2916.4799999999996
few decades that there would be like a

2915.04 --> 2918.5589999999997
well

2916.48 --> 2921.76
a

2918.559 --> 2925.92
a climate pulse shift it's not like an

2921.76 --> 2928.4
uh magnetic pole shift all the drama all

2925.92 --> 2930.2400000000002
everything could destabilize earthquakes

2928.4 --> 2933.44
no

2930.24 --> 2935.839
also not a universal climate change but

2933.44 --> 2938.0
like a climate shift

2935.839 --> 2940.839
because i've been feeling that

2938.0 --> 2943.52
like the hotter mediterranean type

2940.839 --> 2947.68
weather in europe

2943.52 --> 2947.68
was gonna like move upward

2948.559 --> 2953.6800000000003
and i think that in the united states

2950.72 --> 2954.48
and canada it's the other way around

2953.68 --> 2958.72
like

2954.48 --> 2960.4
the the colder parts are like migrating

2958.72 --> 2962.24
downward

2960.4 --> 2964.64
towards the equator

2962.24 --> 2966.3999999999996
so it's getting cooler

2964.64 --> 2968.0789999999997
it should be

2966.4 --> 2970.1600000000003
and maybe

2968.079 --> 2972.559
like the places where the northern

2970.16 --> 2973.92
lights kind of like pop up which kind of

2972.559 --> 2977.92
is magnetic

2973.92 --> 2979.52
is also just moving southwards

2977.92 --> 2982.7200000000003
in the united states so you might be

2979.52 --> 2982.72
able to see it now

2982.8 --> 2985.119
like

2983.76 --> 2987.8390000000004
even more

2985.119 --> 2987.839
than before

2989.119 --> 2994.4
and by the way this would like spell

2991.52 --> 2996.319
good for norway as well because if like

2994.4 --> 2998.1600000000003
indeed the climate is just shifting

2996.319 --> 2999.52
northwards

2998.16 --> 3001.92
here in europe that means they're going

2999.52 --> 3005.04
to get like a much more

3001.92 --> 3008.8
steady moderate climate

3005.04 --> 3008.8
and by the way russia too

3008.88 --> 3015.119
or at least parts of it

3011.839 --> 3015.119
maybe it's because of that

3015.44 --> 3021.2000000000003
it's like the climate pole shift

3018.88 --> 3023.119
i have no idea by the way if something

3021.2 --> 3024.64
similar is happening

3023.119 --> 3026.96
in the

3024.64 --> 3031.1189999999997
yeah the region south of the equator it

3026.96 --> 3034.599
might be simply just the north

3031.119 --> 3034.599
i don't know

3046.64 --> 3050.92
like what would that even imply

3057.28 --> 3061.119
that could be best explanation i've

3059.44 --> 3064.16
heard wow right

3061.119 --> 3066.7200000000003
well i suspected since i was like a

3064.16 --> 3066.72
little kid

3066.96 --> 3071.44
like

3068.48 --> 3073.76
i just picked up random sayings and like

3071.44 --> 3076.16
oh climate change real pool shift or

3073.76 --> 3078.2400000000002
disaster like all these standard stories

3076.16 --> 3079.5989999999997
should get thrown at you you know

3078.24 --> 3082.0789999999997
through media

3079.599 --> 3084.319
more mainstream level

3082.079 --> 3086.8
and it didn't really stick but i just

3084.319 --> 3089.359
like as i was hearing those things

3086.8 --> 3092.559
literally like this is just

3089.359 --> 3093.92
how it happens i would get the idea like

3092.559 --> 3095.76
i think

3093.92 --> 3096.8
that there's going to be like a climate

3095.76 --> 3099.2000000000003
shift

3096.8 --> 3101.8390000000004
in europe it's not climate change it's a

3099.2 --> 3106.16
shift like the hot weather is going to

3101.839 --> 3106.16
typically move more northwards

3107.359 --> 3112.0
so that yeah for spain that would mean

3109.599 --> 3115.839
like dude they are gonna potentially get

3112.0 --> 3117.2
into sahara like situations

3115.839 --> 3119.599
and

3117.2 --> 3124.839
well it's always been pretty hot there

3119.599 --> 3124.839
but that might be even more now

3124.88 --> 3130.0
right and that would almost like make

3126.72 --> 3132.0
france the next spain like it like that

3130.0 --> 3133.68
france would get like a climate very

3132.0 --> 3136.24
similar to spain

3133.68 --> 3138.72
of like the late 20th century

3136.24 --> 3140.0
and the netherlands would be more like

3138.72 --> 3142.64
france

3140.0 --> 3145.839
temperature-wise on average right so

3142.64 --> 3148.16
that it would all just shift

3145.839 --> 3148.16
north

3148.72 --> 3152.64
but it was never like oh my god we're

3150.72 --> 3154.5589999999997
doomed no i was certain

3152.64 --> 3156.8799999999997
as i was envisioning that like you know

3154.559 --> 3158.3190000000004
this is working out great like this is

3156.88 --> 3161.04
good

3158.319 --> 3162.88
like we can all benefit from this

3161.04 --> 3164.079
as long

3162.88 --> 3167.119
as

3164.079 --> 3169.28
things don't collapse

3167.119 --> 3171.839
right i hadn't seen that coming back

3169.28 --> 3174.0
then yet

3171.839 --> 3176.4
i hadn't predicted all this

3174.0 --> 3178.64
would happen back then

3176.4 --> 3180.559
but very young on i just realized like

3178.64 --> 3183.44
yeah the temperature's gone just gonna

3180.559 --> 3186.559
shift north where did i get it from

3183.44 --> 3189.04
it was just an idea

3186.559 --> 3191.3590000000004
like as an oracle

3189.04 --> 3193.52
just like that happens it's just like oh

3191.359 --> 3195.119
this is gonna happen i'm predicting this

3193.52 --> 3197.119
out of nowhere i don't even know where i

3195.119 --> 3198.559
got this from i just like thought of it

3197.119 --> 3200.559
and it's like

3198.559 --> 3203.0400000000004
i think this is gonna happen

3200.559 --> 3204.2400000000002
i can feel it i don't know what else to

3203.04 --> 3207.359
say about it

3204.24 --> 3209.1189999999997
and it is happening

3207.359 --> 3210.7999999999997
and i'm not worried about it in the

3209.119 --> 3213.839
slightest

3210.8 --> 3213.8390000000004
more worried that

3214.8 --> 3220.0
europe is gonna just get in too much

3217.359 --> 3223.68
political turmoil and crap

3220.0 --> 3226.24
and break down in this yeah

3223.68 --> 3228.3999999999996
that we won't just be able to easily

3226.24 --> 3230.9599999999996
adapt to that

3228.4 --> 3232.559
slight transition

3230.96 --> 3234.559
right because every if everything would

3232.559 --> 3236.559
have been stable all throughout then it

3234.559 --> 3238.2400000000002
could it would have always been very

3236.559 --> 3239.8390000000004
easy

3238.24 --> 3243.2799999999997
to like adapt

3239.839 --> 3245.7599999999998
to how the the climate shifts

3243.28 --> 3248.3190000000004
shift not change shift

3245.76 --> 3250.7200000000003
by looking at the southern neighbors

3248.319 --> 3251.92
like how did they deal with that

3250.72 --> 3255.2799999999997
typically

3251.92 --> 3258.16
can we assimilate some of these tricks

3255.28 --> 3259.76
to adapt to the slighter heat over here

3258.16 --> 3264.0789999999997
right

3259.76 --> 3267.5200000000004
and well if that [ __ ] same shift effect

3264.079 --> 3270.1600000000003
is also happening in the other direction

3267.52 --> 3272.319
towards the south in america in the

3270.16 --> 3273.68
north american

3272.319 --> 3275.359
continent

3273.68 --> 3277.839
it's getting colder well then you could

3275.359 --> 3279.92
do the same thing in the other way right

3277.839 --> 3282.4
how are they dealing with that cold in

3279.92 --> 3285.28
the north you might need to learn a few

3282.4 --> 3285.28
tricks about that

3287.2 --> 3291.7599999999998
right because

3288.799 --> 3295.119
it could be that certainly your region

3291.76 --> 3299.119
becomes on average a little colder

3295.119 --> 3299.119
that could be a great advantage as well

3299.599 --> 3301.839
right

3301.92 --> 3306.2000000000003
save you on a lot of air conditioning

3306.72 --> 3311.1189999999997
like plants don't dry out as quickly

3310.079 --> 3313.44
so

3311.119 --> 3313.44
yeah

3314.24 --> 3316.5589999999997
this is

3316.88 --> 3320.2000000000003
what i do

3321.119 --> 3325.079
think about these things

3338.079 --> 3344.0
anyway i'm gonna like keep an eye out

3341.119 --> 3346.6400000000003
for what's going on in

3344.0 --> 3351.28
the united states and canada and see if

3346.64 --> 3352.16
they indeed this slight climate

3351.28 --> 3354.4
uh

3352.16 --> 3356.48
shift seasonal climate shift that's

3354.4 --> 3358.1600000000003
happening here if there is something

3356.48 --> 3360.559
similar happening in the united states

3358.16 --> 3362.8799999999997
in the other direction because

3360.559 --> 3364.48
i had not never really considered that

3362.88 --> 3366.2400000000002
even back then i was always thinking

3364.48 --> 3368.319
like no this is just europe it's just

3366.24 --> 3371.04
happening here it's just like

3368.319 --> 3371.92
i i did not even think of outside of

3371.04 --> 3373.2
europe

3371.92 --> 3377.06
back then

3373.2 --> 3384.2189999999996
my world was not that big in my mind yet

3377.06 --> 3384.219
[Music]

3392.96 --> 3396.7200000000003
heating is also air conditioning

3397.76 --> 3400.76
true

3423.599 --> 3430.1600000000003
oh really flatters it you have

3426.16 --> 3430.16
more vegetation in the desert yeah

3431.68 --> 3435.1189999999997
and and you know what

3435.599 --> 3440.2400000000002
it's also been happening in africa

3437.76 --> 3441.6800000000003
actually and that is even

3440.24 --> 3443.359
more fascinating i haven't even

3441.68 --> 3444.16
connected it

3443.359 --> 3447.839
like

3444.16 --> 3447.839
maybe it is also happening

3448.48 --> 3453.2
like in the southern

3450.96 --> 3455.52
yeah south of the equator

3453.2 --> 3457.839
because even like

3455.52 --> 3459.52
is it 20 years ago or something maybe

3457.839 --> 3463.2
even late 90s

3459.52 --> 3463.2
i still remember the reports

3464.0 --> 3468.64
about like how certain parts of the

3466.24 --> 3470.0789999999997
sahara desert were suddenly just turning

3468.64 --> 3473.04
green

3470.079 --> 3476.48
the grass was growing but this was like

3473.04 --> 3478.0
in the south part of it

3476.48 --> 3482.48
so

3478.0 --> 3485.359
maybe there it's also migrating north

3482.48 --> 3487.599
that would mean that the south of africa

3485.359 --> 3490.799
and especially south africa would also

3487.599 --> 3490.799
be cooling down

3491.68 --> 3495.48
wouldn't that be fascinating

3518.24 --> 3521.1189999999997
coolers what

3527.52 --> 3534.0
ontario has had more mild winters

3531.92 --> 3537.64
what do you mean mild winters

3534.0 --> 3537.64
warmer or colder

3547.76 --> 3552.0400000000004
warmer

3549.04 --> 3552.04
okay

3565.68 --> 3568.68
hmm

3580.0 --> 3583.0
hmm

3618.319 --> 3622.799
ain't no warming there

3620.079 --> 3622.799
okay george

3624.24 --> 3627.1189999999997
well me yeah

3625.66 --> 3629.359
[Music]

3627.119 --> 3630.6400000000003
look i'm just trying to model out the

3629.359 --> 3632.88
effect

3630.64 --> 3635.359
right maybe it doesn't really affect

3632.88 --> 3635.359
norway

3638.319 --> 3645.04
maybe this is just like

3641.2 --> 3648.319
just this very specific region that is

3645.04 --> 3648.319
to which this is happening

3651.28 --> 3656.1600000000003
maybe it's like a climate

3653.2 --> 3658.0789999999997
model shift

3656.16 --> 3662.04
don't even know like where to start

3658.079 --> 3662.04
trying to explain that

3676.079 --> 3680.3590000000004
hey psycbear good to see you

3695.2 --> 3699.04
that you had it wrong george sanford

3698.0 --> 3702.079
climate

3699.04 --> 3705.7599999999998
climates always change always will it is

3702.079 --> 3708.2400000000002
called seasons not weather

3705.76 --> 3708.2400000000002
seasons

3708.88 --> 3712.839
that's the way to say it

3715.49 --> 3718.66
[Music]

3728.319 --> 3732.319
right yeah clutch and

3733.28 --> 3736.079
it

3734.079 --> 3737.6800000000003
it happened historically even in the

3736.079 --> 3738.6400000000003
netherlands right

3737.68 --> 3741.68
in

3738.64 --> 3744.0
like the renaissance era

3741.68 --> 3748.64
it got so cold in the winters here that

3744.0 --> 3748.64
literally the seas froze

3748.72 --> 3752.3999999999996
get it

3750.16 --> 3754.96
not just the rivers but even the seas

3752.4 --> 3756.2400000000002
just started to freeze up here in the

3754.96 --> 3757.68
netherlands

3756.24 --> 3761.2799999999997
and that's

3757.68 --> 3764.0789999999997
is it like 300 years ago

3761.28 --> 3764.079
something like that

3766.96 --> 3770.48
can you imagine that the netherlands and

3768.72 --> 3771.359
we're like oh it's getting warmer here

3770.48 --> 3772.48
yeah

3771.359 --> 3776.0
hey

3772.48 --> 3779.76
we had a period where literally the seas

3776.0 --> 3780.96
salty sea water froze up it was that

3779.76 --> 3783.599
cold

3780.96 --> 3785.44
okay i don't even want to imagine what

3783.599 --> 3790.2400000000002
it would have been like like

3785.44 --> 3790.2400000000002
living in norway during that era dude

3790.559 --> 3797.0
yeah this is that would have been some

3793.039 --> 3797.0
frosty ass [ __ ]

3816.319 --> 3820.72
yeah

3818.24 --> 3822.64
yeah flatter stage

3820.72 --> 3824.3999999999996
a bit scary yeah well it was scary back

3822.64 --> 3826.5589999999997
then because

3824.4 --> 3829.2000000000003
well the netherlands was a

3826.559 --> 3832.96
a transporting nation it was a

3829.2 --> 3835.4399999999996
a sea fair trade nation pretty much

3832.96 --> 3838.0
and suddenly like yeah the entire winter

3835.44 --> 3840.4
you just couldn't do anything

3838.0 --> 3843.839
it was all locked up because just

3840.4 --> 3846.799
ice everywhere totally screwed

3843.839 --> 3850.4
it was very difficult

3846.799 --> 3850.4
it's that yeah

3850.559 --> 3855.039
we had trade posts

3852.4 --> 3857.039
around the world already but yeah like

3855.039 --> 3860.48
in the winter you just couldn't connect

3857.039 --> 3862.96
back to your to the to the home country

3860.48 --> 3865.96
because it was just frozen couldn't get

3862.96 --> 3865.96
through

3868.64 --> 3873.2
i had to like wait for these for the

3870.88 --> 3875.6800000000003
spring and then of course that's when

3873.2 --> 3877.2
war and [ __ ] breaks out

3875.68 --> 3879.0389999999998
when all the pirates come out because

3877.2 --> 3881.359
suddenly it's like oh yeah now all the

3879.039 --> 3883.28
transports are gonna like all the goods

3881.359 --> 3885.44
they've been collecting are now gonna go

3883.28 --> 3887.44
to the netherlands

3885.44 --> 3889.44
and other regions there and it's like

3887.44 --> 3892.88
yeah this is loot time so there would

3889.44 --> 3896.799
have been like every spring

3892.88 --> 3896.799
sea wars probably

3900.079 --> 3905.8390000000004
because yeah in that time like the

3901.839 --> 3906.839
netherlands was very isolated and at war

3905.839 --> 3908.64
with like

3906.839 --> 3910.799
spain

3908.64 --> 3912.96
i think

3910.799 --> 3915.28
around that time roughly might be a

3912.96 --> 3917.68
little bit later i don't exactly know

3915.28 --> 3920.4
the dates it's just around that time

3917.68 --> 3922.48
and yeah you you could only reach the

3920.4 --> 3924.1600000000003
netherlands through the sea

3922.48 --> 3925.76
because you really could not through

3924.16 --> 3928.72
land because we were surrounded by

3925.76 --> 3928.7200000000003
enemies pretty much

3930.0 --> 3935.4
there's no way you're going to get

3931.44 --> 3935.4
resources over land

3936.64 --> 3939.44
so yeah the

3938.4 --> 3941.44
the that

3939.44 --> 3944.16
micro ice age as they call it

3941.44 --> 3945.359
historically that was like a huge hassle

3944.16 --> 3948.68
here

3945.359 --> 3948.68
back then

3949.36 --> 3952.53
[Music]

3986.24 --> 3992.8799999999997
if clouds don't drop rain white don't

3989.28 --> 3995.039
clouds disappear as it rains well they

3992.88 --> 3995.039
do

3996.88 --> 4000.4
they do disappear they just don't

3998.88 --> 4001.76
immediately

4000.4 --> 4005.2000000000003
disappear

4001.76 --> 4008.2400000000002
but they just thin out

4005.2 --> 4010.48
and then they shrink a little

4008.24 --> 4013.7599999999998
but you have to realize that

4010.48 --> 4015.2
if it's like an isolated raincrack cloud

4013.76 --> 4018.2400000000002
it's also

4015.2 --> 4020.72
going to be cooling off the moist of the

4018.24 --> 4024.0789999999997
air that surrounds it as

4020.72 --> 4026.24
it enters that region so it's gonna

4024.079 --> 4029.039
re-assimilate

4026.24 --> 4031.359
water from the air surrounding it and

4029.039 --> 4034.88
that's how it can just keep going it's

4031.359 --> 4037.359
almost like a creature like

4034.88 --> 4039.76
a water

4037.359 --> 4041.92
elemental like snail that is just

4039.76 --> 4044.48
absorbing water around it and just

4041.92 --> 4046.7200000000003
dropping it as it goes

4044.48 --> 4048.72
but it's also absorbing the water that's

4046.72 --> 4051.2799999999997
surrounding the cloud

4048.72 --> 4054.0
as it is entering that region

4051.28 --> 4055.92
it's condensing then it freezes then it

4054.0 --> 4058.64
turns into rain again and drops on the

4055.92 --> 4062.079
ground because there is a lot of moist

4058.64 --> 4064.0
in the air dissolved in the air

4062.079 --> 4066.1600000000003
that's just hanging around

4064.0 --> 4068.559
until it cools off enough that it

4066.16 --> 4069.52
actually can become droplets and that's

4068.559 --> 4071.76
yeah

4069.52 --> 4072.96
big rain clouds sponge up

4071.76 --> 4075.6800000000003
the moist

4072.96 --> 4078.319
dissolved in the air surrounding it

4075.68 --> 4078.319
as it moves

4089.039 --> 4093.92
right and if there isn't any moist

4091.599 --> 4097.1990000000005
dissolved in the air

4093.92 --> 4099.1990000000005
then a rain cloud that might come into

4097.199 --> 4101.12
being for whatever reason yeah if it

4099.199 --> 4103.599999999999
starts raining it's going to dissolve

4101.12 --> 4105.839
very quickly and just from rain

4103.6 --> 4107.4400000000005
and then

4105.839 --> 4112.04
it's all gone

4107.44 --> 4112.04
if there's just no moist in the air

4125.92 --> 4130.04
what are you talking about

4148.239 --> 4151.44
hey so you start water

4152.319 --> 4157.2390000000005
coffee trading in the netherlands ah

4160.159 --> 4162.799
oh cool

4170.159 --> 4173.879999999999
return flights

4178.88 --> 4181.12
what

4185.279 --> 4189.839000000001
oh this

4186.48 --> 4189.839
this is a fiction

4194.719 --> 4199.36
limited preview can only

4197.04 --> 4203.84
check two pages

4199.36 --> 4203.839999999999
or three but yeah thanks i guess

4224.239 --> 4227.759999999999
any news about the farmers

4229.679 --> 4231.92
nothing

4230.8 --> 4234.64
radical

4231.92 --> 4236.64
new it's i mean it's just it they're

4234.64 --> 4238.4800000000005
just keeping going and

4236.64 --> 4240.159000000001
well they're getting a lot of media

4238.48 --> 4245.08
attention at least

4240.159 --> 4245.08
i mean the news is going around and

4247.679 --> 4251.76
there seem to be a lot of people that

4249.84 --> 4253.52
are sympathizing

4251.76 --> 4255.52
a lot

4253.52 --> 4258.0
so

4255.52 --> 4261.280000000001
the moral seems to be standing strong at

4258.0 --> 4261.28
least the morale

4262.239 --> 4267.599999999999
but yeah i'm just i'm still just kind of

4265.28 --> 4269.679
checking through social media and all

4267.6 --> 4272.679
that news little news articles here and

4269.679 --> 4272.679
there

4276.4 --> 4281.28
and the tone is getting proper

4281.84 --> 4285.12
like

4282.719 --> 4288.159
i'm very glad that there's finally some

4285.12 --> 4292.0
serious nationalist sentiment popping up

4288.159 --> 4295.36
because that's been like quenched

4292.0 --> 4296.88
hard for quite some time here

4295.36 --> 4298.88
and

4296.88 --> 4301.84
that's finally changing

4298.88 --> 4301.84
very happy about that

4302.719 --> 4306.88
so yeah it's still just going and going

4310.239 --> 4315.919999999999
and we're getting like we're even

4312.08 --> 4317.84
getting support from general flynn now

4315.92 --> 4319.92
there's a lot of these people that are

4317.84 --> 4322.0
like sort of on the resistance against

4319.92 --> 4324.2390000000005
the globalist that are

4322.0 --> 4327.679
like giving us kudos and all that or the

4324.239 --> 4330.32
farmers at least not me personally

4327.679 --> 4333.1990000000005
so yeah

4330.32 --> 4333.199
but other than that

4333.36 --> 4338.0
i'm keeping close track of if there's

4335.52 --> 4340.2390000000005
some actual developments like okay we're

4338.0 --> 4342.0
going to arrest them now

4340.239 --> 4345.04
that doesn't seem to be happening yet

4342.0 --> 4347.84
but there's a lot of research and

4345.04 --> 4347.84
digging out

4348.48 --> 4353.678999999999
of like

4350.719 --> 4357.199
illegal actions and [ __ ] and and like

4353.679 --> 4358.88
blatant deception so a case is very much

4357.199 --> 4361.678999999999
building against

4358.88 --> 4363.36
our globalist infiltrators

4361.679 --> 4364.8
also there's other countries that are

4363.36 --> 4367.36
unrolling

4364.8 --> 4369.360000000001
similar idiotic systems

4367.36 --> 4371.28
canada is doing that now

4369.36 --> 4373.5199999999995
apparently

4371.28 --> 4375.92
right

4373.52 --> 4378.2390000000005
they're going for the

4375.92 --> 4381.04
same ridiculous policy

4378.239 --> 4381.919999999999
no anti-nitrogen

4381.04 --> 4383.28
which is

4381.92 --> 4386.64
ridiculous

4383.28 --> 4390.0
it's absolutely insane

4386.64 --> 4392.320000000001
it's like maybe even worse than co2

4390.0 --> 4394.0
nonsense

4392.32 --> 4396.08
sri lanka yeah but that's been happening

4394.0 --> 4399.12
that happened a while ago and it's a

4396.08 --> 4400.96
it's of a different nature

4399.12 --> 4402.48
with sri lanka

4400.96 --> 4406.159
because

4402.48 --> 4406.159
they're already kind of screwed

4406.239 --> 4409.5199999999995
like

4407.52 --> 4414.400000000001
their country also went completely

4409.52 --> 4416.4800000000005
bankrupt they're like in serious [ __ ]

4414.4 --> 4418.48
right the netherlands is not in that

4416.48 --> 4419.759999999999
sort of position

4418.48 --> 4421.919999999999
it's different

4419.76 --> 4421.92
like

4425.679 --> 4431.2390000000005
well not yet at least and like to keep

4427.84 --> 4431.2390000000005
it that way

4450.64 --> 4456.159000000001
how is that george sanford

4452.8 --> 4456.159000000001
what are you even saying that

4460.08 --> 4467.36
get ready for the diet change uh no get

4463.76 --> 4471.360000000001
ready to basically kill off a bunch of

4467.36 --> 4471.36
[ __ ] up eugenicist politicians

4475.36 --> 4479.199
or some really [ __ ] up

4480.0 --> 4485.199
agents of them maybe police

4482.56 --> 4487.76
swat teams whatever that is maybe even

4485.199 --> 4489.839999999999
military right

4487.76 --> 4492.2390000000005
maybe they are going to be like sent

4489.84 --> 4493.12
after whoever is just not giving into

4492.239 --> 4495.759999999999
this

4493.12 --> 4497.36
well they got to meet every a counter

4495.76 --> 4501.84
force to that

4497.36 --> 4501.839999999999
from us so get ready for that

4504.8 --> 4511.12
get ready for some serious clashes with

4507.6 --> 4513.280000000001
wounded and potentially dead

4511.12 --> 4518.32
that has there's no other option and you

4513.28 --> 4518.32
got to do it or surrender and and die

4520.8 --> 4525.1990000000005
right but anyway in the netherlands the

4522.8 --> 4528.4800000000005
entire agenda is exposed i tried to

4525.199 --> 4529.5199999999995
expose it like even way back

4528.48 --> 4534.239
that

4529.52 --> 4536.64
these freaking politician nut cases

4534.239 --> 4539.28
they're literally just trying to erase

4536.64 --> 4541.04
our agriculture like they're taking it

4539.28 --> 4543.28
away

4541.04 --> 4545.6
just away and they want to convert the

4543.28 --> 4547.36
entire netherlands into a [ __ ] up

4545.6 --> 4551.360000000001
shitty like

4547.36 --> 4553.92
city state turn it into like a a giant

4551.36 --> 4556.96
california or los angeles california is

4553.92 --> 4559.04
way too big but just like a giant los

4556.96 --> 4562.0
angeles city or something

4559.04 --> 4567.28
terrible the worst idea ever

4562.0 --> 4569.52
and what a waste of really good

4567.28 --> 4574.08
multiple generational

4569.52 --> 4575.679
farmland it's so insane

4574.08 --> 4578.48
and

4575.679 --> 4580.96
like even i think even that even if the

4578.48 --> 4583.199
the dumb public and i don't think we

4580.96 --> 4584.64
even have that much dumb public here in

4583.199 --> 4586.32
the netherlands

4584.64 --> 4588.719
i think where there's a lot of [ __ ] and

4586.32 --> 4590.4
people that are like pretending to be on

4588.719 --> 4592.719
the globalist side because they're just

4590.4 --> 4595.839999999999
too [ __ ] afraid to stand up for

4592.719 --> 4595.84
common sense

4596.32 --> 4601.5199999999995
but i think even if they somehow

4599.199 --> 4603.678999999999
slow down the net dutch response like

4601.52 --> 4606.96
the rest of the world

4603.679 --> 4608.4800000000005
is like not accepting it because

4606.96 --> 4611.28
these farmers

4608.48 --> 4614.239
actually are important

4611.28 --> 4615.84
for the interests of other countries

4614.239 --> 4618.4
other countries

4615.84 --> 4621.1990000000005
are in dire need of our farmers product

4618.4 --> 4622.96
so it's not just our national issue even

4621.199 --> 4624.5599999999995
though that's a very important part of

4622.96 --> 4628.32
it of course right we don't want to turn

4624.56 --> 4630.400000000001
into this [ __ ] up globalist city state

4628.32 --> 4632.799999999999
getting filled with migrants going all

4630.4 --> 4635.599999999999
the hell

4632.8 --> 4639.12
like it will go completely to hell if

4635.6 --> 4641.4400000000005
they get their way it will be a terrible

4639.12 --> 4645.36
terrible place to be

4641.44 --> 4646.879999999999
if they get their way it will be horror

4645.36 --> 4648.799999999999
right like

4646.88 --> 4650.8
terrible

4648.8 --> 4655.76
i don't want that ever to happen i would

4650.8 --> 4655.76
go to war to prevent that if necessary

4657.04 --> 4662.96
but other countries are agreeing with

4660.08 --> 4666.5599999999995
that so it's not just oh will the dutch

4662.96 --> 4669.36
go to make up their own mind no no

4666.56 --> 4672.56
there's outsider interest too in keeping

4669.36 --> 4675.36
it the way it is is not just us and i am

4672.56 --> 4675.360000000001
glad of that

4675.52 --> 4679.1990000000005
because that way the freaking cocking

4677.76 --> 4680.4800000000005
that might be happening here in the

4679.199 --> 4683.12
netherlands it's just not going to

4680.48 --> 4685.04
matter because outsiders will just be

4683.12 --> 4687.12
like no

4685.04 --> 4691.28
we're not going to give you just the

4687.12 --> 4692.64
luxury to [ __ ] it up for us as well

4691.28 --> 4695.44
that's good

4692.64 --> 4695.4400000000005
i like that

4702.32 --> 4706.719
right but in the meantime there is kind

4704.32 --> 4709.28
of a bigger universal problem and that's

4706.719 --> 4711.6
the euro the euro is slowly going to

4709.28 --> 4711.599999999999
[ __ ]

4711.679 --> 4716.0
and that's a problem not just in the

4713.44 --> 4718.32
netherlands but everywhere

4716.0 --> 4720.32
because they have just overplayed their

4718.32 --> 4722.08
hand

4720.32 --> 4725.28
they've been throwing around too much

4722.08 --> 4730.8
money for too terrible a [ __ ] like

4725.28 --> 4731.84
really wasted it just waste waste waste

4730.8 --> 4734.2390000000005
i mean

4731.84 --> 4736.64
this is starting to get like american

4734.239 --> 4738.4
liberal politician level of money

4736.64 --> 4740.64
wasting

4738.4 --> 4743.28
and i don't understand like how it's

4740.64 --> 4745.1990000000005
just being done

4743.28 --> 4747.28
and it's for quite a while i don't

4745.199 --> 4750.799999999999
understand how like

4747.28 --> 4753.12
some ruling party can just decide that

4750.8 --> 4757.52
and then do it

4753.12 --> 4757.5199999999995
i don't understand why that's possible

4759.28 --> 4764.159
why there isn't some mechanism with in

4762.08 --> 4765.84
the government inherently that's gonna

4764.159 --> 4767.92
literally say like

4765.84 --> 4771.28
no you're not

4767.92 --> 4771.28
you're just not gonna do that

4772.159 --> 4775.719
there should be

4778.38 --> 4783.04
[Music]

4782.08 --> 4784.5599999999995
right

4783.04 --> 4787.199
the constitution

4784.56 --> 4789.120000000001
well there look even in the netherlands

4787.199 --> 4790.639999999999
there's also reports

4789.12 --> 4791.44
that

4790.64 --> 4795.12
are

4791.44 --> 4798.0
parliament that is part of the system

4795.12 --> 4799.84
is being ignored by the

4798.0 --> 4800.8
yeah the ruling

4799.84 --> 4803.52
group

4800.8 --> 4805.360000000001
in control like they're ignoring

4803.52 --> 4808.4800000000005
the rest of the parliament which is

4805.36 --> 4809.679
highly illegal like they don't have the

4808.48 --> 4811.199
authority

4809.679 --> 4812.4800000000005
to do that

4811.199 --> 4815.5199999999995
and any

4812.48 --> 4818.718999999999
like very feeble claim that they have

4815.52 --> 4822.159000000001
that authority based on some like oh

4818.719 --> 4824.8
pandemic emergency [ __ ] rules

4822.159 --> 4827.28
like that's already been so

4824.8 --> 4830.08
detailed exposed that

4827.28 --> 4830.08
like no

4830.159 --> 4835.92
you can't actually do that anymore

4833.28 --> 4838.5599999999995
it's been completely dismantled you're

4835.92 --> 4841.679
acting like naughty conspiracy theorists

4838.56 --> 4844.159000000001
now about your presupposition that

4841.679 --> 4846.88
allows you to do all these things

4844.159 --> 4848.799999999999
you don't actually have that legally and

4846.88 --> 4853.1990000000005
if it would be brought to court then it

4848.8 --> 4853.1990000000005
would not stand at this point

4855.44 --> 4859.599999999999
but they're just like

4857.28 --> 4862.32
elbowing their way through it

4859.6 --> 4865.360000000001
ignoring everything

4862.32 --> 4869.679
and i don't get it like how that even

4865.36 --> 4871.839999999999
works like how that how they can do that

4869.679 --> 4875.2390000000005
but that can just be done like that i

4871.84 --> 4875.2390000000005
don't get it

4876.239 --> 4883.12
but the developments do seem to be going

4878.96 --> 4883.12
in in the right direction and they are

4883.36 --> 4890.719
losing massive amounts of popularity

4887.36 --> 4890.719
yeah the ruling parties here

4890.96 --> 4895.92
and everybody is becoming aware that

4892.88 --> 4898.159000000001
they are traitors to the country like

4895.92 --> 4900.32
finally it's not just something an

4898.159 --> 4902.879999999999
extremist would say no it is really

4900.32 --> 4903.679
understood now that they are

4902.88 --> 4906.32
by

4903.679 --> 4908.4
by proven things that they've done

4906.32 --> 4909.92
that they are effectively traitors to

4908.4 --> 4911.839999999999
the country now

4909.92 --> 4914.4
people are getting it it's re-sparking

4911.84 --> 4915.12
nationalist sentiment

4914.4 --> 4917.44
like

4915.12 --> 4920.32
and in that sense like all that all that

4917.44 --> 4922.4
globalist indoctrination no more gay no

4920.32 --> 4923.199
nationalism nationalism bad

4922.4 --> 4926.32
oh

4923.199 --> 4929.12
guess what's being completely wiped off

4926.32 --> 4932.08
the map now because of your doubling

4929.12 --> 4934.88
down going too far

4932.08 --> 4937.84
not not stopping not being reasonable

4934.88 --> 4940.4800000000005
pushing it through all all that work

4937.84 --> 4942.719
it's been gradually

4940.48 --> 4944.718999999999
like socially engineered into us for

4942.719 --> 4947.6
like the last 30 years i'll guess what's

4944.719 --> 4950.56
being completely wiped off the map in

4947.6 --> 4951.84
like one two years time now

4950.56 --> 4954.8
huh

4951.84 --> 4956.88
i hope it was worth it

4954.8 --> 4960.8
because

4956.88 --> 4962.4800000000005
this bullshit's gonna end very quickly

4960.8 --> 4966.4800000000005
we're not gonna go with that sort of

4962.48 --> 4968.5599999999995
nonsense anymore now you see like even

4966.48 --> 4971.12
the regular liberals

4968.56 --> 4974.400000000001
here that are like dutch liberal

4971.12 --> 4976.719
not american liberals not freaks

4974.4 --> 4978.879999999999
like even they are like yeah we've been

4976.719 --> 4981.76
doing we've been going along this ride

4978.88 --> 4983.76
long enough now like

4981.76 --> 4984.84
we're not gonna play into this anymore

4983.76 --> 4986.4800000000005
it's all

4984.84 --> 4988.639
lies

4986.48 --> 4990.5599999999995
if we want to achieve such goals we're

4988.639 --> 4992.8
going to have to do it ourselves in

4990.56 --> 4995.4400000000005
another way because these people are

4992.8 --> 4995.4400000000005
traitors

4999.28 --> 5001.84
what

5002.96 --> 5006.56
i no

5005.0 --> 5012.36
[Music]

5006.56 --> 5012.360000000001
it's five there is no more than five

5018.08 --> 5025.36
i mean if you keep up holding derpcon 5

5022.639 --> 5027.36
like literally to that level

5025.36 --> 5029.199
like you're not going to be

5027.36 --> 5031.28
hanging around the internet much though

5029.199 --> 5034.159
you're probably going to end up

5031.28 --> 5036.0
in a loony bin

5034.159 --> 5038.96
because people are going to get very

5036.0 --> 5038.96
worried about you

5039.04 --> 5043.6
because that sort of behavior to that

5041.04 --> 5046.08
level cannot

5043.6 --> 5047.92
just stay on the internet it's gonna

5046.08 --> 5049.84
echo in your mind outside of the

5047.92 --> 5051.76
internet and it's gonna

5049.84 --> 5053.28
catch people's attention you're gonna

5051.76 --> 5057.159000000001
[ __ ] things up

5053.28 --> 5057.159
gonna get carried away

5059.12 --> 5063.92
yeah so derpcon 5 really is the maximum

5062.88 --> 5066.96
and

5063.92 --> 5067.84
you can't technically to stay derpcon 5

5066.96 --> 5069.84
is

5067.84 --> 5071.76
technically impossible because you are

5069.84 --> 5073.679
going to go insane

5071.76 --> 5076.8
and you are going to end up

5073.679 --> 5079.679
being isolated for your own good

5076.8 --> 5079.679
by society

5081.52 --> 5085.120000000001
so

5082.239 --> 5087.44
derpcon 5 is usually reserved for

5085.12 --> 5090.0
like a maximum

5087.44 --> 5091.839999999999
point outburst like when somebody really

5090.0 --> 5093.199
goes ballistic and it doesn't last that

5091.84 --> 5094.159000000001
long

5093.199 --> 5099.599999999999
most

5094.159 --> 5102.159
derp derps hang around derpcon 4.

5099.6 --> 5104.08
that's like the the real trolls that

5102.159 --> 5106.32
like to come back those are usually

5104.08 --> 5108.159
derpcon 4 because if they're 5 they

5106.32 --> 5111.12
can't hang around

5108.159 --> 5113.199
5 comes with insanity

5111.12 --> 5115.679
can't hold on to that you gotta

5113.199 --> 5119.04
understand the derpcon chart it's a very

5115.679 --> 5122.2390000000005
serious chart i know it sounds so silly

5119.04 --> 5125.239
it's such a goofball word but it's so

5122.239 --> 5125.239
serious

5127.12 --> 5131.199
i like to [ __ ] around like that you know

5153.44 --> 5158.28
con that sounds like a nasa convention

5170.719 --> 5177.4800000000005
anyway i hope you're doing all right see

5172.239 --> 5177.48
star wars the moving situation

5183.76 --> 5189.4400000000005
i want to move out of the us so bad why

5186.88 --> 5192.0
why not just move to a better region in

5189.44 --> 5192.0
the us

5192.159 --> 5196.4
there's a it's a very big country fiber

5195.52 --> 5201.1990000000005
roads

5196.4 --> 5201.199
very big so it all depends on like where

5201.6 --> 5204.639
where are you going to settle

5205.28 --> 5210.159
i mean if you're going to be in big

5207.04 --> 5212.0
cities yeah it's going to be shitty

5210.159 --> 5215.199
or you could go to the

5212.0 --> 5219.199
the wilds and then you're gonna have to

5215.199 --> 5219.199
learn how to survive there and all that

5219.28 --> 5223.199
but i mean

5221.04 --> 5225.84
not everything in the united states

5223.199 --> 5225.839999999999
sucks

5226.4 --> 5231.44
alaska well that you could do that but

5229.04 --> 5235.28
it's freaking cold

5231.44 --> 5239.12
i mean it is really cold there

5235.28 --> 5241.199
and there's not a lot of light so

5239.12 --> 5245.8
but yeah you could

5241.199 --> 5245.799999999999
nobody's gonna bother you there probably

5257.36 --> 5262.92
uh yeah i beat you too with godzilla

5259.6 --> 5262.92
that's right

5288.32 --> 5291.92
ugh

5289.92 --> 5292.84
okay seeking star wars not so good i

5291.92 --> 5298.28
take it

5292.84 --> 5298.28
then i'll try not to remind you of it

5312.56 --> 5316.56
take a bit of fresh air here because

5314.719 --> 5318.32
it's like really nice

5316.56 --> 5319.4400000000005
and shy away on the balcony i just want

5318.32 --> 5323.48
to

5319.44 --> 5323.48
good breather be right back

5360.239 --> 5363.239
what

5437.28 --> 5439.679
anyway

5443.28 --> 5448.84
behind every bladed bath

5445.44 --> 5448.839999999999
that's a lot

5453.92 --> 5458.92
right i hope you guys been enjoying the

5455.92 --> 5458.92
show

5463.84 --> 5471.08
like to remind you that

5466.239 --> 5471.08
i could definitely use support

5494.4 --> 5500.638999999999
so please support your local arwyn

5498.08 --> 5501.92
so i don't get into more debt and all

5500.639 --> 5505.12
that

5501.92 --> 5508.4800000000005
get through this inflationary phase well

5505.12 --> 5511.28
look the one good thing about

5508.48 --> 5513.5199999999995
the euro basically plummeting

5511.28 --> 5515.36
is that donations from outside of the

5513.52 --> 5518.76
country are going to effectively be

5515.36 --> 5518.759999999999
worth more

5524.88 --> 5527.76
so there's yeah i guess that's an

5526.48 --> 5531.879999999999
advantage

5527.76 --> 5531.88
i don't know how long it'll last

5534.8 --> 5537.92
hello matthew hall

5536.639 --> 5541.639
good to see you thank you for the 10

5537.92 --> 5541.639
pound super chat donation

5568.4 --> 5571.4

5610.159 --> 5613.159
what

5629.76 --> 5634.88
okay just bumped into a really weird

5632.32 --> 5634.88
article

5635.679 --> 5638.2390000000005
what the

5638.32 --> 5642.04
it's just weird

5646.47 --> 5649.609
[Music]

5649.679 --> 5653.76
hey where is pissed off and who is that

5652.32 --> 5654.799999999999
a why

5653.76 --> 5658.4400000000005
what

5654.8 --> 5658.4400000000005
are you talking about

5659.84 --> 5662.96
a very nun

5669.04 --> 5673.0
facebook banjo again

5681.23 --> 5684.509999999999
[Music]

5684.56 --> 5687.56
wow

5690.4 --> 5694.48
yeah that sounds pretty messed up

5692.08 --> 5694.48
matthew

5698.88 --> 5704.92
what lost history of the world guy

5701.92 --> 5704.92
awesome

5706.24 --> 5709.3
[Music]

5716.88 --> 5721.119
the melted building ether guy what

5722.719 --> 5727.679
why would you give a [ __ ] about what he

5724.48 --> 5728.879999999999
says it's totally insane

5727.679 --> 5734.6
if you're

5728.88 --> 5734.6
a melted buildings guy you're an idiot

5743.36 --> 5749.679
like why would you be worried for them

5745.76 --> 5749.679
banning you or something i mean

5750.4 --> 5756.759999999999
a lot of this stuff out there is just

5752.56 --> 5756.76
complete garbage guys

5760.08 --> 5764.0
it's hard to find something that's

5762.639 --> 5769.4400000000005
even

5764.0 --> 5772.4
set yet cohesive to a satisfactory level

5769.44 --> 5772.4
it's tough

5774.719 --> 5780.639
a lot of people are just blabbering and

5777.199 --> 5782.96
they don't really have a vision

5780.639 --> 5784.8
right that's the problem oh they heard

5782.96 --> 5786.4
some things and then oh they're puzzling

5784.8 --> 5788.2390000000005
with it oh look at this sounds

5786.4 --> 5790.4
interesting when you say it like that

5788.239 --> 5793.04
there's no cohesion though they don't

5790.4 --> 5795.199
really have a vision

5793.04 --> 5798.0
just hearing stuff and trying to be

5795.199 --> 5800.4
relevant and interesting but they're not

5798.0 --> 5800.4
really

5809.44 --> 5816.4
hope i'm not projecting too much uh

5814.239 --> 5819.44
side guys too oh yeah there was a

5816.4 --> 5823.719
zeitgeist too wasn't there

5819.44 --> 5823.719
i don't think i've ever seen that

5832.08 --> 5837.32
how old do you think the earth is

5843.679 --> 5849.679
looping buildings on a mountain around

5846.8 --> 5849.679
it's very funny

5850.08 --> 5854.76
how old do i think the earth is i

5858.639 --> 5862.88
i don't know if anybody truly knows

5863.76 --> 5867.52
everybody's just making estimates and

5865.679 --> 5869.76
what are you making an estimate on based

5867.52 --> 5874.080000000001
on certain

5869.76 --> 5874.08
readings your interpretations and

5874.56 --> 5880.56
i think that the earth is probably older

5876.8 --> 5880.56
than we can measure

5881.28 --> 5885.84
but it's not like billions of years

5886.0 --> 5889.719
absolutely not

5909.92 --> 5914.8
i mean to me it's still kind of a

5911.679 --> 5916.2390000000005
mystery like how it

5914.8 --> 5917.92
formed anyway

5916.239 --> 5920.159
right

5917.92 --> 5920.159
like

5921.679 --> 5927.52
how did that work was there a material

5924.719 --> 5929.679
realm was there was it like an elemental

5927.52 --> 5931.4400000000005
material was it there

5929.679 --> 5934.159
or was that too

5931.44 --> 5936.32
like manifested first

5934.159 --> 5939.4
in the bible doesn't really give answers

5936.32 --> 5939.4
to this

5939.52 --> 5942.56
i have not really

5943.199 --> 5948.638999999999
gotten to figure it out through other

5945.28 --> 5951.639
religions either on the surface at least

5948.639 --> 5951.639
like

5955.76 --> 5961.360000000001
was there just god

5958.0 --> 5963.679
and nothing and then he created

5961.36 --> 5967.839999999999
the realm and it just manifested and

5963.679 --> 5967.84
then time started in entropy

5968.0 --> 5970.239
and

5971.119 --> 5975.599999999999
can we actually

5973.36 --> 5976.96
is it even possible to accurately

5975.6 --> 5981.84
measure

5976.96 --> 5981.84
or calculate the original moment

5982.0 --> 5987.84
or is like the entropy of everything

5985.04 --> 5989.92
does it make it impossible to actually

5987.84 --> 5992.84
measure it perfectly because

5989.92 --> 5996.639
all the settings of everything change

5992.84 --> 5996.639
slightly over time

5998.239 --> 6001.44
because of entropy i don't know

6005.679 --> 6009.84
ten thousand twenty thousand years maybe

6011.04 --> 6014.719
i'm open to the possibility

6014.8 --> 6020.8
but maybe like time wasn't even the same

6018.56 --> 6023.8
the way it is now

6020.8 --> 6023.8
right

6034.88 --> 6039.6
what do you think god did prior to

6037.119 --> 6042.32
existence

6039.6 --> 6043.280000000001
was what was his purpose there wasn't

6042.32 --> 6047.08
any

6043.28 --> 6047.08
and he didn't do anything

6050.32 --> 6053.28
it was just there

6053.52 --> 6058.8
probably being eternally bored with

6056.4 --> 6058.799999999999
knowing

6063.679 --> 6067.4400000000005
i everything know

6064.719 --> 6068.88
that's kind of a human interpretation of

6067.44 --> 6070.719
what that would be like

6068.88 --> 6074.400000000001
we don't know maybe he was just

6070.719 --> 6076.159
eternally sleeping and bliss

6074.4 --> 6078.48
bliss just to be

6076.159 --> 6080.96
to just be

6078.48 --> 6080.959999999999
knowledge

6081.84 --> 6087.119000000001
maybe something woke him up

6084.48 --> 6087.119
or maybe

6088.32 --> 6092.88
he was just sick of it

6090.239 --> 6095.36
sick of the

6092.88 --> 6098.679
the perfection

6095.36 --> 6098.679
i don't know

6098.73 --> 6101.7699999999995
[Music]

6121.04 --> 6126.32
some say god was with jesus

6124.32 --> 6129.44
yeah sure it was

6126.32 --> 6129.44
the holy spirit

6130.239 --> 6134.32
sure

6132.48 --> 6138.28
before the beginning well how would

6134.32 --> 6138.28
anybody know that

6148.32 --> 6154.48
and like how does that even make sense

6150.48 --> 6157.5199999999995
that everything already existed before

6154.48 --> 6160.4
it was actually made

6157.52 --> 6160.400000000001
i don't see that

6161.119 --> 6166.719
i mean maybe upon the manifestation of

6164.159 --> 6171.04
the material realm and time

6166.719 --> 6173.199
did everything already exist before or

6171.04 --> 6175.5199999999995
in the moment like that everything just

6173.199 --> 6177.759999999999
happens instantaneously every form and

6175.52 --> 6179.679
then the time actually starts to row in

6177.76 --> 6180.56
a linear fashion

6179.679 --> 6182.56
right

6180.56 --> 6185.52
that upon the moment of conception of

6182.56 --> 6188.080000000001
time and in the material realm

6185.52 --> 6190.56
that in one fleeting moment everything

6188.08 --> 6193.04
that would ever be

6190.56 --> 6197.1990000000005
already manifested like

6193.04 --> 6199.28
in one point in time in god's mind

6197.199 --> 6200.879999999999
and then everything starts to roll out

6199.28 --> 6204.639
yeah sure

6200.88 --> 6207.04
in that sense i'd say yeah you jesus

6204.639 --> 6209.92
and the holy spirit which you could just

6207.04 --> 6212.88
say well maybe that is just like

6209.92 --> 6212.88
i don't know what it is

6213.76 --> 6217.6
that that is

6215.52 --> 6219.76
that it was already there in

6217.6 --> 6222.88
pre-creation in the moment

6219.76 --> 6222.88
in that flash moment

6228.32 --> 6234.48
but truly before the manifestation of of

6232.4 --> 6238.08
time

6234.48 --> 6239.678999999999
and the matter itself no nothing existed

6238.08 --> 6243.199
before that

6239.679 --> 6243.1990000000005
only god's mind

6244.48 --> 6249.759999999999
and maybe it wasn't even considerably a

6247.76 --> 6252.56
mind because there was nothing to

6249.76 --> 6252.56
reflect upon

6254.56 --> 6258.84
maybe it was just

6256.96 --> 6260.4800000000005
being and that's

6258.84 --> 6263.52
all

6260.48 --> 6263.5199999999995
just the consciousness

6264.719 --> 6267.28
i don't know

6268.8 --> 6273.92
this is just wild speculation it is

6271.199 --> 6276.32
completely futile right because it is

6273.92 --> 6278.8
technically completely futile to try and

6276.32 --> 6282.5599999999995
imagine that which encompasses all

6278.8 --> 6282.56
things that you are a part of

6285.92 --> 6291.36
i mean i can probably make it sound very

6288.4 --> 6293.5199999999995
smart but i could never translate the

6291.36 --> 6296.719
totality

6293.52 --> 6296.719
of what it really is

6298.0 --> 6303.48
no no other realms there's no point

6307.84 --> 6313.1990000000005
there's no other realms it's just this

6311.199 --> 6317.28
no other creators

6313.199 --> 6319.759999999999
no other places this is it

6317.28 --> 6322.48
that it could be way more than anybody

6319.76 --> 6325.1990000000005
could ever handle

6322.48 --> 6327.44
you don't need more than one potential

6325.199 --> 6329.599999999999
infinity

6327.44 --> 6332.0
you understand

6329.6 --> 6334.320000000001
it makes no sense if there's going to be

6332.0 --> 6336.48
another creator or even another realm by

6334.32 --> 6338.159
the same creator

6336.48 --> 6340.4
what's going to prioritize how is he

6338.159 --> 6343.199
going to divide his energy

6340.4 --> 6343.199
his attention

6343.28 --> 6350.719
it's no point like what is he gonna do

6346.159 --> 6352.719
mix it well then it was one creation

6350.719 --> 6354.639
right i mean there might be multiple

6352.719 --> 6357.52
realms

6354.639 --> 6358.56
it's just one creation there is no point

6357.52 --> 6360.320000000001
to have

6358.56 --> 6365.320000000001
more than one

6360.32 --> 6365.32
one creator one physical existence

6385.52 --> 6388.52
bye

6413.44 --> 6416.96
what are you talking about

6419.52 --> 6425.159000000001
what the hell are you talking about

6421.04 --> 6425.159
freaking cars man

6435.199 --> 6439.839999999999
let's use the chat

6437.44 --> 6441.599999999999
somebody that specifically does a show

6439.84 --> 6444.96
based on the interactions with the chat

6441.6 --> 6446.8
to just blabber random [ __ ] in the

6444.96 --> 6449.44
middle of a heavy philosophical

6446.8 --> 6450.719
discussion because that's helpful isn't

6449.44 --> 6453.04
it

6450.719 --> 6453.04
yes

6454.0 --> 6458.96
and not just some slot machine okay

6457.28 --> 6462.32
can you please

6458.96 --> 6462.32
just keep it serious

6469.6 --> 6474.320000000001
are you gonna have to donate to my

6471.04 --> 6476.32
paypal you want to just [ __ ] around

6474.32 --> 6479.719
at least make it worth my time don't

6476.32 --> 6479.719
waste it

6512.88 --> 6516.14
i'm gonna round out the show this is

6514.719 --> 6519.329
just pointless

6516.14 --> 6519.329000000001
[Music]

6520.48 --> 6524.959999999999
i mean this is just general discord

6523.119 --> 6527.36
level conversation what the hell am i

6524.96 --> 6529.28
even gonna do with all this nonsense

6527.36 --> 6531.599999999999
that you're spouting

6529.28 --> 6535.639
you guys right now like what am i

6531.6 --> 6535.639
supposed to do with that

6541.44 --> 6544.879999999999
don't drown well then stop talking

6543.679 --> 6547.1990000000005
nonsense

6544.88 --> 6551.719
that's like that i can't say anything

6547.199 --> 6551.719
about that's not relevant to anything

6561.28 --> 6565.04
maybe i should do a troll day stream oh

6563.199 --> 6567.44
that's fine we could do a troll day

6565.04 --> 6567.44
stream

6567.76 --> 6573.04
if i get money for that because i'm not

6570.159 --> 6575.5199999999995
gonna just have everybody troll and then

6573.04 --> 6579.36
do it for free have my energy wasted on

6575.52 --> 6579.360000000001
that for free i'm not gonna do that

6580.96 --> 6584.639
yeah

6582.48 --> 6588.48
i have a if you want to troll it's going

6584.639 --> 6588.4800000000005
to be paid to troll policy

6588.96 --> 6592.32
you said there's other realms

6591.52 --> 6593.119000000001
yeah

6592.32 --> 6595.199
but

6593.119 --> 6598.48
why would you assume that those other

6595.199 --> 6599.919999999999
realms are made separately

6598.48 --> 6601.759999999999
clutch

6599.92 --> 6604.8
right remember the

6601.76 --> 6608.2390000000005
multiple realm segment being split up

6604.8 --> 6610.719
cut off through the loop

6608.239 --> 6613.44
split off through loops

6610.719 --> 6615.76
well they would have all originated from

6613.44 --> 6618.159
a singular creation

6615.76 --> 6621.04
it would have to it makes absolutely no

6618.159 --> 6623.04
sense that separate material realms

6621.04 --> 6625.92
would have been separately created

6623.04 --> 6627.04
completely outside of each other outside

6625.92 --> 6629.92
like what

6627.04 --> 6632.239
i'll just completely redesign the entire

6629.92 --> 6634.719
thing again

6632.239 --> 6636.879999999999
or just copy it

6634.719 --> 6639.84
what the [ __ ] look what the hell's the

6636.88 --> 6639.84
point

6640.48 --> 6644.32
and where's all that energy coming from

6651.44 --> 6656.48
how do you force them to pay though no

6654.239 --> 6658.638999999999
well you guys if you guys want a troll

6656.48 --> 6660.879999999999
day then you're gonna have to pay me for

6658.639 --> 6660.88
that

6662.159 --> 6665.679
they're not gonna pay me if you want

6664.159 --> 6668.96
that

6665.679 --> 6668.96
not gonna do it for free

6675.28 --> 6678.32
get

6676.159 --> 6679.28
out

6678.32 --> 6681.84
get

6679.28 --> 6686.0
out

6681.84 --> 6686.0
get the [ __ ] out of here

6693.04 --> 6697.76
oh i'm not actually killing him i'm just

6695.36 --> 6700.08
trying to get him the hell out of my

6697.76 --> 6700.08
room

6700.159 --> 6703.92
she's freaking flying in front of my

6702.159 --> 6706.638999999999
screen all the time it's really

6703.92 --> 6706.639
agitating

6707.199 --> 6710.96
no it's not a wasp it's a fly

6711.28 --> 6716.32
wasps are not even a quarter that

6713.92 --> 6718.96
irritating

6716.32 --> 6720.4
i haven't seen any wasps by the way

6718.96 --> 6723.36
not at all

6720.4 --> 6726.598999999999
i've seen more bees though that's nice

6723.36 --> 6726.598999999999
and butterflies

6736.719 --> 6739.199
not physical

6738.239 --> 6743.04
what

6739.199 --> 6743.04
a not physical realm

6743.52 --> 6748.320000000001
so not a realm then clutch if it's not

6746.4 --> 6750.4
physical it's not a realm

6748.32 --> 6754.4
that makes absolutely no sense there is

6750.4 --> 6754.4
no non-physical realm

6755.28 --> 6757.119
that's

6756.08 --> 6759.28
just like

6757.119 --> 6761.598999999999
the spirit that's just spirits

6759.28 --> 6764.4
connecting and then that's virtual

6761.599 --> 6767.52
that's a virtual realm then if it's not

6764.4 --> 6769.598999999999
physical it's virtual not actual

6767.52 --> 6770.8
it's basically the mind and however it

6769.599 --> 6774.0
fills it in

6770.8 --> 6777.76
and it might even share with other minds

6774.0 --> 6780.239
it's not physical it's not a

6777.76 --> 6783.4400000000005
that makes no sense

6780.239 --> 6785.919999999999
you could call it a dimension

6783.44 --> 6788.719
but since the only things that we are

6785.92 --> 6790.4800000000005
are even based off the physical realm we

6788.719 --> 6793.199
are gonna take

6790.48 --> 6796.08
our reflections of the physical realm

6793.199 --> 6798.799999999999
into the non-physical realm

6796.08 --> 6801.36
yeah because all

6798.8 --> 6803.92
all of our mind all of our ideas all of

6801.36 --> 6807.598999999999
our visions are all based off

6803.92 --> 6810.96
reflections of the physical realm

6807.599 --> 6814.4800000000005
we don't even have conception without

6810.96 --> 6816.719
reflection from the physical realm

6814.48 --> 6819.44
we can't even in visualize anything

6816.719 --> 6819.44
without it

6819.52 --> 6827.52
so no there is absolutely guaranteed no

6823.92 --> 6829.4400000000005
non-physical realm doesn't exist

6827.52 --> 6832.4800000000005
you could call it another dimension but

6829.44 --> 6835.44
yeah that only exists based

6832.48 --> 6839.36
upon the spirit interacting with the

6835.44 --> 6842.4
material realm to create the sub

6839.36 --> 6844.159
sub realm you might call it or dimension

6842.4 --> 6848.839999999999
based on the spirits that are

6844.159 --> 6848.839999999999
interacting with the physical realm

6851.04 --> 6856.0
physical does not mean real that excuse

6853.84 --> 6856.0
me

6857.119 --> 6861.119
we're talking not about physic we're

6859.199 --> 6863.36
talking about a realm a realm is a

6861.119 --> 6866.88
physical place

6863.36 --> 6870.239
if it's not physical it's not a realm

6866.88 --> 6870.2390000000005
realm is physical

6872.08 --> 6875.679
realm

6873.199 --> 6876.719
with an m not real

6875.679 --> 6879.28
realm

6876.719 --> 6882.08
you're gonna use the word realm

6879.28 --> 6882.08
it's physical

6882.639 --> 6888.400000000001
if you create in your mind in your dream

6885.92 --> 6891.119
a virtual realm

6888.4 --> 6893.598999999999
yeah it might present itself like a

6891.119 --> 6895.92
reflection of a physical realm that is

6893.599 --> 6898.159000000001
just all yours and you keep it that way

6895.92 --> 6900.56
so it's your internal little realm well

6898.159 --> 6903.5199999999995
it's not actually a realm it's not real

6900.56 --> 6907.280000000001
it's your mind's creation based

6903.52 --> 6911.2390000000005
on reflections of your interactions with

6907.28 --> 6911.239
the physical realm

6923.84 --> 6930.76
is the afterlife of physical existence

6927.119 --> 6930.759999999999
i don't think so

6938.57 --> 6941.62
[Music]

6941.84 --> 6946.4400000000005
disagree with your definition of realm

6947.52 --> 6952.0
but well you can disagree with it but i

6949.92 --> 6955.159
don't think that the language disagrees

6952.0 --> 6955.159
with me

6960.56 --> 6964.2390000000005
right

6961.599 --> 6965.52
well what would a realm be it would be a

6964.239 --> 6968.4
place

6965.52 --> 6971.599
what what does the word place mean it's

6968.4 --> 6971.598999999999
a location it's

6971.84 --> 6976.159000000001
space

6973.119 --> 6980.0
how can you have all any of those traits

6976.159 --> 6982.5599999999995
without physical reality without a

6980.0 --> 6983.92
physical substance

6982.56 --> 6987.4400000000005
you can't

6983.92 --> 6990.88
it doesn't make any sense then

6987.44 --> 6990.879999999999
kingdom domain yeah sure

7000.719 --> 7005.599
it's electromagnetism another realm or

7003.679 --> 7008.8
dimension no

7005.599 --> 7011.4400000000005
no that's part of the physical realm

7008.8 --> 7014.400000000001
it's literally within it

7011.44 --> 7016.32
we can measure it it's right here

7014.4 --> 7017.44
it's part of the realm it's part of the

7016.32 --> 7019.119
physical

7017.44 --> 7020.96
realm

7019.119 --> 7025.239
it's literally here it's not another

7020.96 --> 7025.2390000000005
dimension it's right here

7049.36 --> 7054.0
okay well that's another version of the

7051.52 --> 7057.360000000001
word realm then

7054.0 --> 7058.8
it's like a field the field of this

7057.36 --> 7061.199
mental thing

7058.8 --> 7063.679
this information yeah you could also use

7061.199 --> 7066.638999999999
the word realm for that

7063.679 --> 7069.4400000000005
but i'm talking about the realm the

7066.639 --> 7073.84
physical realm

7069.44 --> 7073.839999999999
that's what we're calling it

7075.28 --> 7080.4
unless you think the word planet would

7077.28 --> 7080.4
be more appropriate

7082.239 --> 7089.598999999999
electricity isn't physical though

7086.0 --> 7091.199
it's not physical matter

7089.599 --> 7093.04
it's not a

7091.199 --> 7095.28
molecule

7093.04 --> 7097.5199999999995
but it is

7095.28 --> 7101.08
within physics though it is measure it's

7097.52 --> 7101.080000000001
physically measurable

7101.199 --> 7107.678999999999
it is a naturally occurring phenomenon

7103.52 --> 7108.96
it does exist within the physical realm

7107.679 --> 7112.0
yes so

7108.96 --> 7115.76
it's still part of the physical realm

7112.0 --> 7118.32
because it's here we can measure it

7115.76 --> 7119.92
and arguably even the same could be said

7118.32 --> 7122.08
for light

7119.92 --> 7125.84
even though it is like

7122.08 --> 7128.5599999999995
the the least material type of substance

7125.84 --> 7130.159000000001
it's the most far away from it in our

7128.56 --> 7132.400000000001
experience

7130.159 --> 7135.839999999999
but it's still measurable we can still

7132.4 --> 7135.839999999999
very manipulate it create it

7136.0 --> 7140.96
utilize it within the physical realm so

7138.719 --> 7143.84
it is physical in that sense it's just

7140.96 --> 7143.84
not material

7156.719 --> 7160.56
what does that matter gorzilla

7165.92 --> 7172.08
you're just

7167.199 --> 7172.08
doing semantics now this is the point

7174.239 --> 7180.159
just saying

7176.88 --> 7182.56
there's no other place

7180.159 --> 7182.5599999999995
that is

7182.84 --> 7188.56
physical and any

7185.119 --> 7190.4
dimension that is purely spiritual

7188.56 --> 7193.119000000001
is going to be

7190.4 --> 7197.119
secondary to the physical realm because

7193.119 --> 7200.639
it's always filled up with actual things

7197.119 --> 7202.08
that our spirits have derived from

7200.639 --> 7206.32
experience

7202.08 --> 7206.32
interactions with the physical realm

7209.84 --> 7214.88
don't believe telekinesis is real

7212.08 --> 7214.88
immeasurable

7224.159 --> 7227.159
um

7228.8 --> 7235.599
well i've never seen control telekinesis

7233.36 --> 7239.44
like in real world

7235.599 --> 7242.56
but like telekinetic side effects

7239.44 --> 7245.44
right uncontrolled telekinesis for sure

7242.56 --> 7247.92
that exists i literally experience it

7245.44 --> 7251.04
all the time

7247.92 --> 7253.28
in a non all too dramatic way but things

7251.04 --> 7254.4
like clicking and banging and popping in

7253.28 --> 7255.679
very specific

7254.4 --> 7257.839999999999
sets of my

7255.679 --> 7258.8
when i'm like a focus in a very specific

7257.84 --> 7260.56
way

7258.8 --> 7262.56
then it happens it's almost like the

7260.56 --> 7265.360000000001
world starts to physically start to

7262.56 --> 7267.76
communicate with me like spirits

7265.36 --> 7269.28
and like where before it just did not do

7267.76 --> 7273.360000000001
that

7269.28 --> 7275.04
a very odd type of clicks material

7273.36 --> 7276.799999999999
manifestations

7275.04 --> 7278.8
things that are just like

7276.8 --> 7282.4800000000005
well seem telekinetic but i have no

7278.8 --> 7284.2390000000005
control over that so control telekinesis

7282.48 --> 7287.5199999999995
i've never seen it

7284.239 --> 7289.759999999999
do i believe that might be possible

7287.52 --> 7293.040000000001
well

7289.76 --> 7295.4400000000005
in a way i'd like to think so but again

7293.04 --> 7297.92
i've never seen it for real

7295.44 --> 7300.5599999999995
right so i'm not just gonna surrender to

7297.92 --> 7302.719
what i want to be real

7300.56 --> 7304.56
i don't know if it can be controlled or

7302.719 --> 7309.159
if that might have like devastating

7304.56 --> 7309.159000000001
consequences i don't know

7313.28 --> 7318.759999999999
yeah we don't need to know that thank

7315.119 --> 7318.759999999999
you very much

7335.119 --> 7339.159
done all agree right

7339.52 --> 7342.88
but

7340.4 --> 7345.119
just have to know that

7342.88 --> 7346.2390000000005
if i'm going to be persistent about

7345.119 --> 7349.119
something

7346.239 --> 7350.48
i do it for a very good reason very

7349.119 --> 7351.598999999999
detailed

7350.48 --> 7353.839999999999
huh

7351.599 --> 7355.84
yeah you don't bring that up here we

7353.84 --> 7356.96
don't talk about that [ __ ]

7355.84 --> 7359.52
yeah

7356.96 --> 7362.08
this is not your oh spooky let's get all

7359.52 --> 7365.040000000001
witch's [ __ ] and let's try

7362.08 --> 7367.599
let's try some dark magic [ __ ] no thank

7365.04 --> 7369.84
you jacob

7367.599 --> 7372.32
i don't do that and i don't want to talk

7369.84 --> 7375.4400000000005
about that and i don't want to remind it

7372.32 --> 7377.759999999999
exists to anybody because nobody should

7375.44 --> 7379.598999999999
be having their attention drawn to that

7377.76 --> 7380.639
sort of thing ever

7379.599 --> 7383.360000000001
ever

7380.639 --> 7383.36
you understand

7393.28 --> 7398.0
welcome by the way

7395.52 --> 7398.0
i guess

7401.36 --> 7408.239
but yeah i'm not an echo chamber

7405.04 --> 7412.56
if somebody disagrees with me

7408.239 --> 7415.36
then they can make an argument

7412.56 --> 7418.080000000001
but it's usually going to end up in them

7415.36 --> 7420.08
hanging on to semantics

7418.08 --> 7422.719
when like the more structural

7420.08 --> 7424.8
overarching

7422.719 --> 7426.88
themes that i try to put out and

7424.8 --> 7429.1990000000005
structures that i try to highlight are

7426.88 --> 7431.119
very well reasoned through

7429.199 --> 7432.719
and in the sense not that i planned it

7431.119 --> 7436.239
and wrote it down but that it's

7432.719 --> 7438.4
extremely systematic and persistent

7436.239 --> 7440.718999999999
like it's so systematic and persistent

7438.4 --> 7443.679
that i don't have a conscious overview

7440.719 --> 7446.4800000000005
over it it just happens to me

7443.679 --> 7449.4800000000005
and i i have that grip whenever i need

7446.48 --> 7449.48
it

7452.88 --> 7457.4400000000005
and if i need to explain details then i

7455.36 --> 7458.96
can and i will when i do and i do it

7457.44 --> 7461.199
effectively

7458.96 --> 7461.199
uh

7461.84 --> 7464.400000000001
hey

7462.84 --> 7468.719
aaron

7464.4 --> 7468.719
planet earth is a planet no it's not

7470.88 --> 7474.88
it's math

7472.4 --> 7476.96
an exclusion of perspective based

7474.88 --> 7478.96
machinations

7476.96 --> 7481.44
built upon a

7478.96 --> 7482.8
celestial apparent sphere that's not

7481.44 --> 7485.678999999999
actual

7482.8 --> 7487.84
and a flat plane that's what planet

7485.679 --> 7491.4
earth actually is

7487.84 --> 7491.400000000001
howard moore

7508.96 --> 7514.079
is a creation by god

7511.76 --> 7514.079000000001
yeah

7515.36 --> 7519.32
can't argue with that

7521.57 --> 7525.03
[Music]

7544.159 --> 7547.5599999999995
what is god

7548.079 --> 7553.679
the arbiter of all information and ideas

7551.119 --> 7556.159
the creator of the akashic library the

7553.679 --> 7558.56
alpha and the omega

7556.159 --> 7560.32
the designer of life and the shaper of

7558.56 --> 7563.04
this realm

7560.32 --> 7566.159
and the overseer throughout all time the

7563.04 --> 7570.0
dispenser of all information and ideas

7566.159 --> 7570.0
to all people and all beings

7571.76 --> 7576.1990000000005
is that detailed enough

7581.84 --> 7584.56
a good one

7588.56 --> 7592.719
have you got an independent very

7590.32 --> 7594.32
dependent verb no because we can't very

7592.719 --> 7596.4
manipulate him

7594.32 --> 7597.5199999999995
yeah

7596.4 --> 7600.239
but

7597.52 --> 7602.56
there's an ontological primitive in the

7600.239 --> 7604.879999999999
sense that there is no other way that

7602.56 --> 7608.2390000000005
existence could be

7604.88 --> 7611.52
not technically it's impossible

7608.239 --> 7614.0
for their for god a designer

7611.52 --> 7615.599
outside of this realm to design it all

7614.0 --> 7617.76
throughout all time

7615.599 --> 7620.159000000001
with all information there is no other

7617.76 --> 7623.119000000001
way this can be

7620.159 --> 7625.28
in the sense that no other way has ever

7623.119 --> 7627.199
even been conceived that is logically

7625.28 --> 7628.719
consistent and doesn't break down in

7627.199 --> 7630.4
fallacy

7628.719 --> 7632.8
literally

7630.4 --> 7635.839999999999
there is no other option

7632.8 --> 7637.52
than that god created the realm

7635.84 --> 7639.92
it's the only

7637.52 --> 7642.400000000001
sound piece or reasoning that can be

7639.92 --> 7644.2390000000005
uttered figured out by man in order to

7642.4 --> 7647.839999999999
explain existence

7644.239 --> 7650.32
that is not based on complete fallacy

7647.84 --> 7653.599
that's a fact

7650.32 --> 7657.36
you can't prove god scientifically

7653.599 --> 7659.679
but you can derive deduce it

7657.36 --> 7660.719
that it has to be as an ontological

7659.679 --> 7662.32
primitive

7660.719 --> 7664.4800000000005
because otherwise

7662.32 --> 7669.32
this there is no other conceivable way

7664.48 --> 7669.32
by which all exists as it does

7672.47 --> 7675.509
[Music]

7684.32 --> 7688.32
oh god i think we got some

7686.4 --> 7691.759999999999
derpcon

7688.32 --> 7691.759999999999
situation going here

7694.719 --> 7700.04
can prove the intelligent design

7697.04 --> 7700.04
scientifically

7707.119 --> 7712.0
i don't know about that

7709.44 --> 7715.28
but again ontological primitive it's not

7712.0 --> 7716.4
science it's just basic logic logic and

7715.28 --> 7717.599
reasoning

7716.4 --> 7719.679
right

7717.599 --> 7722.56
because all these things

7719.679 --> 7724.56
are what is is it's not science science

7722.56 --> 7727.76
only proves the cause of an effect you

7724.56 --> 7728.8
have to be able to very manipulate that

7727.76 --> 7730.639
cause

7728.8 --> 7732.719
as the experiment you have to be able to

7730.639 --> 7735.04
physically interact with it in order to

7732.719 --> 7737.599
establish the cause

7735.04 --> 7738.48
of the presumed effect

7737.599 --> 7739.679
so

7738.48 --> 7741.5199999999995
all these

7739.679 --> 7743.4400000000005
traits like

7741.52 --> 7745.4400000000005
god the creator that

7743.44 --> 7747.598999999999
you can't science that

7745.44 --> 7749.919999999999
it doesn't apply to the scientific

7747.599 --> 7749.92
method

7754.159 --> 7759.719
or rather the scientific method doesn't

7756.0 --> 7759.719
apply to it

7768.2 --> 7771.37
[Music]

7772.56 --> 7778.280000000001
okay you're gonna be like that and just

7775.04 --> 7778.28
[ __ ] off

7791.52 --> 7793.76
what

7794.8 --> 7798.320000000001
new rule

7796.079 --> 7801.04
no it's not really a new rule

7798.32 --> 7802.159
trolls will just get banned

7801.04 --> 7804.88
that's all

7802.159 --> 7807.119
they they're not gonna typically stay

7804.88 --> 7809.599
it's just that if you want like a troll

7807.119 --> 7811.36
free for all show

7809.599 --> 7813.84
or we're gonna advertise like okay

7811.36 --> 7815.28
trolls come in then i want to be paid

7813.84 --> 7816.96
for that i'm not going to do that for

7815.28 --> 7819.28
free that's what i was talking about i'm

7816.96 --> 7821.92
not going to make a rule that

7819.28 --> 7822.96
if you pay then you can troll at all

7821.92 --> 7825.52
time

7822.96 --> 7825.52
just know

7825.599 --> 7830.56
right that's going to completely ruin my

7827.599 --> 7830.56
show if i do that

7833.36 --> 7838.96
because there will be asses that are

7836.239 --> 7841.44
going to actually throw money at me but

7838.96 --> 7843.36
it's not going to be a lot of money but

7841.44 --> 7845.36
they're still gonna see it as this is

7843.36 --> 7849.04
enough for us to now completely start

7845.36 --> 7849.839999999999
dominating your show and ruining it

7849.04 --> 7853.96
so

7849.84 --> 7853.96
it's it's not gonna work

7872.239 --> 7875.839999999999
all right but i think i'm gonna run out

7874.159 --> 7878.159
this show i'm getting kind of hungry and

7875.84 --> 7878.159000000001
all that

7878.48 --> 7882.839999999999
it's been over two hours wow

7892.8 --> 7896.56
might be interesting to the show where

7894.56 --> 7899.04
no one is banned what would happen it

7896.56 --> 7901.1990000000005
well it would be a very noisy

7899.04 --> 7905.28
trollish chat where everybody's gonna be

7901.199 --> 7906.96
acting as crazy and silly as they can

7905.28 --> 7908.639
and that means that i just won't be able

7906.96 --> 7912.92
to do anything with the chat that's

7908.639 --> 7912.92
what's gonna happen then jacob

7915.84 --> 7919.119000000001
am i a fast runner

7921.04 --> 7927.84
well not so much these days

7923.599 --> 7927.84
i'm much more of a sprinter type

7927.92 --> 7934.2390000000005
i mean i can like sprint pretty fast

7932.159 --> 7936.0
if i really needed to but yeah i don't

7934.239 --> 7938.5599999999995
really have like the proper condition

7936.0 --> 7941.199
for that i'd have to like train myself

7938.56 --> 7943.280000000001
first otherwise i just get exhausted too

7941.199 --> 7946.32
quick

7943.28 --> 7948.719
but i've always been more of a

7946.32 --> 7951.44
a sprinter rather than a somebody did

7948.719 --> 7953.52
just like jogs for a very long time or

7951.44 --> 7955.36
something

7953.52 --> 7960.4400000000005
i like sprinting

7955.36 --> 7960.44
if well the temperature's not this hot

7971.36 --> 7976.639
once a month no not not not entirely

7974.48 --> 7979.44
matthew i don't do it once a month it's

7976.639 --> 7981.679
more like once a year

7979.44 --> 7984.5599999999995
and it's always an arbitrary moment

7981.679 --> 7984.56
never announced

7990.56 --> 7997.280000000001
but hey if i accidentally banned you

7993.52 --> 7999.280000000001
like what's that guy's name again

7997.28 --> 8001.04
because sometimes i get like a really

7999.28 --> 8002.5599999999995
annoying trolls and then i'll ban

8001.04 --> 8005.679
anybody that i don't immediately

8002.56 --> 8007.76
recognize and i also accidentally ban

8005.679 --> 8010.32
people that were genuine visitors well

8007.76 --> 8012.2390000000005
you can always contact me like on the

8010.32 --> 8014.4
flat earth debates in the chat there and

8012.239 --> 8016.0
just tell me like hey

8014.4 --> 8017.759999999999
i wasn't actually a troll could you

8016.0 --> 8020.239
please unban me

8017.76 --> 8022.88
and then i'll probably unban you

8020.239 --> 8024.638999999999
i do do that i do accidentally sometimes

8022.88 --> 8026.88
ban non trolls

8024.639 --> 8028.639
when i think they're trolls

8026.88 --> 8031.04
it does happen but you can always

8028.639 --> 8034.2390000000005
contact me and you can also email me

8031.04 --> 8034.239
it's really urgent

8035.84 --> 8042.32
what is my banned troll count really

8040.239 --> 8045.959999999999
right there

8042.32 --> 8045.96
okay let me check

8061.92 --> 8064.32
okay

8065.76 --> 8071.52
why can't you just list this like i

8068.159 --> 8071.5199999999995
can't see how much

8073.04 --> 8078.239
like how much is even like one

8075.76 --> 8081.280000000001
full batch

8078.239 --> 8084.799999999999
like it doesn't say any numbers it's

8081.28 --> 8087.04
such a clunky interface

8084.8 --> 8087.04
uh

8090.639 --> 8094.8
okay i think all in all it's probably

8093.04 --> 8097.28
like 120

8094.8 --> 8101.96
maybe 150

8097.28 --> 8101.96
trolls see it's not that much

8119.92 --> 8124.88
