room here

130.08 --> 136.16000000000003
it is not as cold as it is outside

134.48 --> 138.64
that's why i'm still in my summer

136.16 --> 138.64
clothing

139.92 --> 143.83999999999997
i'll probably change

good to see you

152.4 --> 159.59900000000002

155.76 --> 159.599
of june 2021

164.56 --> 167.12
let's see

167.92 --> 174.55999999999997
what today will bring yesterday's show

171.84 --> 175.599
i watched it back pretty quickly after i

174.56 --> 178.239
did it

175.599 --> 179.2
just very curious and yeah i watched

178.239 --> 183.59900000000002
through the whole thing

179.2 --> 187.44
was very proud of it and

183.599 --> 188.56
yeah even got a compliment from from

187.44 --> 191.12
adam meakin

188.56 --> 194.239
who was also there by the way he had

191.12 --> 194.239
enjoyed it as well

197.04 --> 202.64
60 degree no 16 not

200.08 --> 202.64000000000001
60.

203.28 --> 207.28
i i never calculate temperature in

206.159 --> 213.84
fahrenheit i find

207.28 --> 213.84
fahrenheit very confusing

214.319 --> 216.56
uh

218.64 --> 222.79899999999998
anything interesting happened this

221.44 --> 226.0
weekend

222.799 --> 229.44
uh well yesterday was really a bit

226.0 --> 229.44
uneventful overall

230.39 --> 240.64
[Music]

231.84 --> 244.56
so it's been a relatively quiet weekend

240.64 --> 247.92
poncho pete oh god

244.56 --> 251.28
i forgot about him i haven't seen pancho

247.92 --> 251.28
pete in a long time but

253.76 --> 257.43899999999996
brave to have the conversation

257.44 --> 260.16
i guess so

261.519 --> 266.56
look yeah

264.56 --> 269.919
well yesterday was what it was oh by the

266.56 --> 274.0
way good servant i thank you again

269.919 --> 276.479
for basically being subjected to that

274.0 --> 278.16
i know you're not too well equipped

276.479 --> 280.32
overall to deal with it

278.16 --> 283.84000000000003
it's not the first time i've tried to

280.32 --> 283.84
test you in other ways

284.32 --> 290.0
but yeah i overall i'm glad

287.36 --> 292.24
that i did that show yesterday and i put

290.0 --> 294.639
it down

292.24 --> 296.16
well enough although throughout the

294.639 --> 298.88
thing i was very frustrated

296.16 --> 298.88000000000005
many points

309.039 --> 312.4
but i hope that some people that watched

311.6 --> 315.199
it that i

312.4 --> 316.79999999999995
actually made them think very very

315.199 --> 321.039
carefully

316.8 --> 324.08
and and not

321.039 --> 326.32
become surrender to their condition

324.08 --> 328.88
impulses and how to respond to such

326.32 --> 328.88
inquiries

330.56 --> 334.88
because that's really been the main

332.08 --> 334.88
problem for me

334.96 --> 340.63899999999995
that everybody just gets triggered

336.8 --> 340.639
nobody wants to think about it

341.039 --> 345.759
that's been throughout my life anyway

346.24 --> 350.0
it's not gonna be the last time i'm

347.759 --> 351.68
gonna talk about that

350.0 --> 366.0
but it doesn't mean and i'm gonna talk

351.68 --> 368.24
about such things every day

366.0 --> 371.919
beating down many rabbit holes myself

368.24 --> 371.919
yeah yeah good servant we know

379.44 --> 381.84
oh

383.6 --> 387.44
i think i might change pants because it

386.16 --> 390.47900000000004
is cooling down

387.44 --> 395.84
in the room as well uh

390.479 --> 395.84
hold on

406.84 --> 409.84
hmm

448.84 --> 455.84
right hey agent

453.199 --> 455.84000000000003
good to see you

457.36 --> 464.8
so how's the weather over there

461.52 --> 468.479
in england and in the us is it

464.8 --> 472.08
like this as well as rainy and dreary

468.479 --> 472.08
or do you still have the good weather

472.8 --> 479.84000000000003
ah it's cloudy over there right

484.97 --> 493.199
[Music]

489.84 --> 496.63899999999995
should i feel good

493.199 --> 496.639
i might put my sweater on

497.199 --> 500.16
for now i'm good

503.44 --> 510.16
right so yeah yesterday evening also

506.56 --> 510.16
finished up the i.t crowd

512.159 --> 515.8389999999999
and then this morning i've been because

514.08 --> 519.6800000000001
i've been thinking about it

515.839 --> 523.0390000000001
a lot like i find many of their episodes

519.68 --> 526.4799999999999
like extremely hilarious

523.039 --> 526.48
like i

526.8 --> 531.279
like the first few times i saw that i

529.04 --> 533.76
laughed so hard

531.279 --> 535.8389999999999
right and now i don't actively laugh

533.76 --> 537.519
that hard anymore but inside i just

535.839 --> 538.399
laugh and just these things that are

537.519 --> 541.12
said

538.399 --> 541.12
echo on

541.6 --> 546.08
hello i'm disabled

547.04 --> 551.92
sorry it's if you know the series you

550.88 --> 556.08
know what that is

551.92 --> 559.36
it's yeah it keeps echoing on but then

556.08 --> 563.36
also weird thing because i

559.36 --> 567.12
got a snippet memory from way back

563.36 --> 567.12
there was another person that also

567.279 --> 573.4399999999999
liked the series i watched it with him

571.279 --> 575.279
and then he thought it was funny to try

573.44 --> 578.5600000000001
to ruin

575.279 --> 581.519
it for me by basically

578.56 --> 581.5189999999999
saying something

582.48 --> 588.5600000000001
about it especially that joke

585.76 --> 589.519
the guy because what's happening yeah in

588.56 --> 592.16
that series

589.519 --> 595.44
it's very late in the in the series but

592.16 --> 598.0799999999999
yeah it's not that many episodes anyway

595.44 --> 599.44
they go to a theater they want to go to

598.08 --> 602.1600000000001
the toilet the toilets

599.44 --> 604.8000000000001
are there's issues with them so this the

602.16 --> 607.92
one guy goes to the disabled

604.8 --> 608.24
i have to say it like that toilet and

607.92 --> 610.8
then

608.24 --> 610.8
mocks up

611.76 --> 615.8389999999999
instead of flushing he calls the alarm

614.079 --> 617.4399999999999
and then there's like people in front of

615.839 --> 619.12
the door bashing in the door because

617.44 --> 621.12
they think there's a disabled person

619.12 --> 621.519
having an accident and then he has to

621.12 --> 624.0
act

621.519 --> 625.44
disabled and that like goes completely

624.0 --> 628.64
out of hand eventually

625.44 --> 630.8800000000001
because there just happened to be a bus

628.64 --> 633.8389999999999
with disabled people that are on

630.88 --> 635.76
and out an outing in the theater and

633.839 --> 638.8000000000001
then he's like

635.76 --> 639.279
given a a emergency wheelchair and then

638.8 --> 642.16
moved

639.279 --> 643.76
with that group and then they go like

642.16 --> 647.8389999999999
way to another town in the

643.76 --> 647.8389999999999
it's it's so [Â __Â ] funny

648.079 --> 655.8389999999999
because he's only just trying to

651.279 --> 655.8389999999999
not get caught and

656.079 --> 659.1999999999999
sorry it's just can't get over that but

658.8 --> 661.76
yeah

659.2 --> 664.32
jesse would guys thought it was funny to

661.76 --> 666.959
try to ruin it by saying yeah

664.32 --> 669.6800000000001
in the future like everybody's going to

666.959 --> 669.68
be disabled

671.519 --> 675.839
and then yeah it's weird that i remember

674.88 --> 679.519
that

675.839 --> 681.839
moment and it did ruin it for me

679.519 --> 684.72
at that point after that i didn't want

681.839 --> 684.72
to watch anymore

684.959 --> 689.8389999999999
weird weird to get these flashes back

694.48 --> 699.76
but yeah that that joke's not gonna be

696.959 --> 703.8389999999999
truly ruined for me

699.76 --> 703.8389999999999
of the series

710.24 --> 719.839
this guy

717.6 --> 723.2
oh it's my favorite troll texting me

719.839 --> 731.839
again how he's convinced i'm gay

723.2 --> 731.839
it's just wishful thinking i guess

734.399 --> 736.72
hmm

739.6 --> 743.6
if you don't go down rabbit holes you

741.279 --> 747.279
will never know what lies beneath

743.6 --> 749.36
right but you can get stuck though

747.279 --> 751.6
so you gotta be well prepared for an

749.36 --> 755.04
excavation

751.6 --> 755.0400000000001
an excavation sorry

757.12 --> 760.24
or you'll get stuck

765.279 --> 773.8389999999999
a mole psyop okay that's funny

768.72 --> 773.839
tomenoid hello by the way

782.48 --> 788.639
yes andrew and uh like a a helmet

786.639 --> 791.04
with a headlight would also be very

788.639 --> 791.04
handy

791.76 --> 794.88
you might also want to bring some kind

793.68 --> 797.279
of a pick

794.88 --> 797.279
with you

798.639 --> 802.24
not just for digging through a hard rock

801.519 --> 804.88
or something

802.24 --> 807.279
but also because you can use it to

804.88 --> 809.519
basically hang on if you accidentally

807.279 --> 812.88
drop

809.519 --> 815.12
quickly prevent yourself from falling

812.88 --> 818.16
down a hole

815.12 --> 821.519
for example you know many yeah

818.16 --> 821.519
taking this very literal

825.839 --> 830.9590000000001
think about spelunk i'm basically

827.6 --> 830.9590000000001
thinking about spelunking

838.0 --> 843.76
all right and a rope leading back out is

840.72 --> 847.6800000000001
very handy

843.76 --> 851.4399999999999
but that doesn't you can still get stuck

847.68 --> 851.4399999999999
right even if you have a rope back

854.839 --> 857.839
anyway

868.839 --> 871.839
hmm

880.88 --> 899.62
he lands tunnels to mars what

884.24 --> 902.799
are you talking about tonight

899.62 --> 902.799
[Music]

907.04 --> 913.8389999999999
all right so yeah let's dig through

918.399 --> 920.72
hmm

925.68 --> 929.4399999999999
right yeah yesterday it's just a couple

928.0 --> 941.839
of premieres

929.44 --> 941.839
really it was very little going down

945.199 --> 948.8
okay he has a digging boring company

947.199 --> 954.24
does he

948.8 --> 957.5999999999999
what for

954.24 --> 959.6800000000001
like is he digging for minerals or

957.6 --> 969.839
something

959.68 --> 969.8389999999999
something specific precious resources

984.399 --> 990.399
right oh by the way to feed it back to

988.959 --> 993.5189999999999
the

990.399 --> 995.44
joke going down the rabbit hole a

993.519 --> 998.16
digging boring company could also be

995.44 --> 999.759
very useful to

998.16 --> 1011.8389999999999
get to the bottom of a rabbit hole

999.759 --> 1011.839
although it's quite dramatic like that

1024.319 --> 1027.36
right so guys

1030.64 --> 1038.5590000000002
what would you like me to talk about

1033.6 --> 1041.76
this show

1038.559 --> 1053.84
anything happening out there that's

1041.76 --> 1053.84
worth talking about

1053.919 --> 1056.3200000000002
earth

1064.559 --> 1067.84
flat earth yeah yeah

1070.72 --> 1077.84
what what are my thoughts

1073.76 --> 1082.24
on underground cities like bearing

1077.84 --> 1082.24
that in cuyu never heard of that

1082.88 --> 1088.7990000000002
is that a real city or a mythical city

1085.84 --> 1088.799
let me google it

1090.18 --> 1094.24
[Music]

1092.24 --> 1096.4
right if i was a baller now and really

1094.24 --> 1098.559
stupid i would say oh you just made that

1096.4 --> 1098.5590000000002
up

1099.44 --> 1101.8400000000001
turkey

1106.84 --> 1112.72
huh whoa

1110.72 --> 1123.84
but it's not an inhabitant in it right

1112.72 --> 1123.84
it's just kind of like a ruin

1128.24 --> 1134.84
right yeah dude i don't know exactly

1132.24 --> 1137.84
what it is but i do know it's

1134.84 --> 1137.84
amazing

1158.799 --> 1168.08
i've seen videos about it before

1164.0 --> 1168.08
through new earth channel

1172.48 --> 1176.96
so weird how like because like the

1175.12 --> 1177.6
tunnels in there they have a distinct

1176.96 --> 1181.6000000000001
type of

1177.6 --> 1186.7199999999998
style to them and it's like

1181.6 --> 1186.7199999999998
almost nothing is symmetrical

1187.6 --> 1194.9599999999998
every part of the

1193.039 --> 1196.08
the complex has like different heights

1194.96 --> 1200.32
so it's also

1196.08 --> 1200.32
asymmetrical it's really astounding

1201.039 --> 1204.08
makes you wonder like what were they

1202.64 --> 1207.76
thinking when they were mating

1204.08 --> 1210.559
making it or did it

1207.76 --> 1210.559
did it work

1211.36 --> 1220.32
right did it warp in some way

1214.88 --> 1224.0800000000002
like could it be that it was slightly

1220.32 --> 1224.6399999999999
turned back liquid and then it like kind

1224.08 --> 1226.96
of like

1224.64 --> 1227.8400000000001
displaced and solidified again or

1226.96 --> 1230.96
something right

1227.84 --> 1233.12
something like that now not enough to

1230.96 --> 1235.76
basically make it all collapse

1233.12 --> 1238.32
but did it get a little warped i wonder

1235.76 --> 1238.32
sometimes

1238.64 --> 1242.3200000000002
because otherwise i don't understand why

1240.48 --> 1249.039
it's also

1242.32 --> 1252.32
well asymmetrical

1249.039 --> 1252.32
it certainly uh

1252.799 --> 1263.84
that place certainly defies imagination

1255.76 --> 1263.84
thanks for bringing that up

1282.0 --> 1286.32
yeah hey dr gunzo you're not welcome

1288.84 --> 1291.84
here

1316.88 --> 1323.6000000000001
okay yes andrew i know there are many

1321.2 --> 1325.1200000000001
underground city-like places all over

1323.6 --> 1327.36
the world

1325.12 --> 1329.1999999999998
the one in turkey just happens to be one

1327.36 --> 1332.4799999999998
of the most well-preserved

1329.2 --> 1334.64
biggest ones i don't know how that

1332.48 --> 1347.84
directly relates to america

1334.64 --> 1347.8400000000001
being ran by satanists though

1348.88 --> 1356.4
noaa's flood bro well if it was

1353.6 --> 1357.039
flooded through noah's flood then there

1356.4 --> 1361.44
would be

1357.039 --> 1364.48
a lot of signs of that

1361.44 --> 1367.3600000000001
good servant right because then the

1364.48 --> 1369.44
water would have been getting in

1367.36 --> 1371.76
sea water and so then there should be

1369.44 --> 1374.64
all kinds of salt remnants

1371.76 --> 1375.679
in those caves is that the case i don't

1374.64 --> 1377.6000000000001
know

1375.679 --> 1389.8400000000001
i haven't tested it i haven't seen

1377.6 --> 1389.84
anybody ask that

1391.26 --> 1394.45
[Music]

1400.84 --> 1403.84
hmm

1414.48 --> 1419.919
a stallion 80 12. yeah i'm doing fine

1418.24 --> 1422.96
today

1419.919 --> 1422.96
i hope you too

1425.6 --> 1428.8799999999999
yeah despite the same temperature change

1427.679 --> 1445.8400000000001
my

1428.88 --> 1445.8400000000001
jaw is doing fine

1459.2 --> 1465.279
but yeah those things just should be

1462.799 --> 1465.279
tested

1467.12 --> 1473.84
is there salt remnants

1470.799 --> 1476.96
in the caves

1473.84 --> 1478.559
which would be a sign that oceanic water

1476.96 --> 1482.559
passed through there

1478.559 --> 1485.6
right i mean the flood water

1482.559 --> 1489.279
even from the great flood was salt water

1485.6 --> 1489.279
right was it

1489.84 --> 1492.9599999999998
was it salt water

1494.08 --> 1500.6399999999999
or was it actually sweet water and

1498.32 --> 1502.6399999999999
by that consideration then any oceans

1500.64 --> 1505.2
that would have been there

1502.64 --> 1508.0
beforehand would have probably been a

1505.2 --> 1508.0
lot salter

1508.08 --> 1512.6399999999999
and then the flood water would have

1509.84 --> 1513.6
diluted the salt level of the oceans now

1512.64 --> 1515.8400000000001
present

1513.6 --> 1515.84
right

1517.279 --> 1521.36
i don't know i never thought of that

1526.84 --> 1529.84
before

1540.84 --> 1543.84
hmm

1546.32 --> 1549.36
on the other hand

1550.88 --> 1557.3600000000001
right if it would have been salt

1554.08 --> 1560.48
flood water then

1557.36 --> 1561.1999999999998
yeah there would be a lot more salt

1560.48 --> 1571.679
remnants

1561.2 --> 1573.44
on the land probably

1571.679 --> 1575.76
so i think there's a good chance that

1573.44 --> 1578.4
the flood water was

1575.76 --> 1580.1589999999999
probably brackish water well that's what

1578.4 --> 1582.4
it would have become

1580.159 --> 1585.2
like it's when that much water comes

1582.4 --> 1587.039
down including on land

1585.2 --> 1588.559
there's just going to be a lot of mud

1587.039 --> 1598.8799999999999
and

1588.559 --> 1601.52
yeah that's yeah

1598.88 --> 1604.7990000000002
but i'm just uh just wondering like the

1601.52 --> 1607.12
actual water that came down

1604.799 --> 1613.84
that's probably sweet water why would it

1607.12 --> 1613.84
be salt

1619.84 --> 1626.9599999999998
if it was then like all the lands

1623.36 --> 1628.8799999999999
everything when it's receded

1626.96 --> 1630.799
would have been literally covered in

1628.88 --> 1633.8400000000001
salt

1630.799 --> 1636.799
salt water mud

1633.84 --> 1637.52
and that's not fertile basically that's

1636.799 --> 1640.72
not good

1637.52 --> 1642.96
that would that would be very deadly

1640.72 --> 1642.96
so

1647.76 --> 1652.799
yeah by that by that logic it probably

1651.52 --> 1655.679
wasn't

1652.799 --> 1658.72
salt water maybe just a tiny little

1655.679 --> 1658.72
probably just not

1660.24 --> 1664.159
i think that the salt from the oceans

1662.96 --> 1667.44
really came from

1664.159 --> 1671.2
earth that it was the water mixing up

1667.44 --> 1672.96
with salt that caused the oceans to be

1671.2 --> 1676.799
salt

1672.96 --> 1676.799
does the bible say anything about it

1678.799 --> 1684.559
i mean about the oceans because it does

1682.72 --> 1686.32
say yeah the oceans are sold but does it

1684.559 --> 1689.52
also say exactly why

1686.32 --> 1689.52
how that came to be

1694.72 --> 1699.679
or maybe not the bible maybe the uh

1697.76 --> 1701.76
the book of enoch says something about

1699.679 --> 1701.76
it

1703.679 --> 1707.6000000000001
yes brackish water i know brackish water

1706.799 --> 1712.96
is usually

1707.6 --> 1715.1999999999998
a river like a river

1712.96 --> 1718.159
ending up in an ocean then there it

1715.2 --> 1718.159
becomes brackish

1723.36 --> 1726.6399999999999
right but if it would have been

1724.88 --> 1729.3600000000001
literally half in

1726.64 --> 1732.64
like half salt it would have still left

1729.36 --> 1734.24
a lot of damage on the land

1732.64 --> 1739.8400000000001
because everything was covered by it

1734.24 --> 1739.84
almost everything

1742.72 --> 1748.3990000000001
river with the salt line yeah that's

1744.559 --> 1748.399
yeah that's also possible

1749.84 --> 1756.6399999999999
there's some

1753.36 --> 1761.1999999999998
i think like uh amazonian parts

1756.64 --> 1764.3200000000002
or was it amazon no wait

1761.2 --> 1764.32
it's more north of that

1764.559 --> 1771.039
over at suriname used to be a dutch

1767.6 --> 1773.52
colony that's how i learned about it

1771.039 --> 1774.799
that they have like the the oceanic

1773.52 --> 1777.44
water sometimes goes

1774.799 --> 1777.44
inland

1778.08 --> 1782.24
and then like you literally all the

1780.08 --> 1784.32
trees there are subjected to salt water

1782.24 --> 1787.44
and then it recedes again

1784.32 --> 1789.12
and then there's still like rivers there

1787.44 --> 1790.48
and that are sweet water so it kind of

1789.12 --> 1794.399
like goes half and half

1790.48 --> 1797.919
but yeah the plants the trees there are

1794.399 --> 1800.9599999999998
able to survive that salt water

1797.919 --> 1803.3600000000001
know about that don't know about any

1800.96 --> 1804.72
specific rivers that would have a salt

1803.36 --> 1808.399
line

1804.72 --> 1811.2
like unusual salt rivers

1808.399 --> 1813.6
that are not directly influenced by the

1811.2 --> 1813.6000000000001
ocean

1815.36 --> 1823.84
do you have an example of that harp will

1818.08 --> 1823.84
not be silent

1837.84 --> 1840.48
delaware

1841.52 --> 1845.2
that's a place in the u.s right

1847.44 --> 1852.24
of what a river with a salt line the

1850.96 --> 1865.8400000000001
first thing you said

1852.24 --> 1865.84
here do you have an example of that

1875.12 --> 1880.08
the delaware wait that's the name of the

1878.559 --> 1882.399
river

1880.08 --> 1882.399
huh

1885.519 --> 1895.519
okay i thought it was a place

1892.64 --> 1895.519
let me look that up

1896.58 --> 1899.6599999999999
[Applause]

1901.519 --> 1907.84
delaware river

1918.84 --> 1921.84
hmm

1933.2 --> 1938.0
i'm trying to find something about the

1946.84 --> 1949.84
salt

1951.519 --> 1957.2
okay i don't don't see it

1954.72 --> 1958.48
i just there's this part where it's

1957.2 --> 1962.96
basically ending up

1958.48 --> 1963.76
in a bay but that's the any salt that

1962.96 --> 1965.919
would be in there

1963.76 --> 1967.6
would simply because it's like to the

1965.919 --> 1969.6000000000001
open ocean

1967.6 --> 1970.9599999999998
right it ends up in delaware bay but

1969.6 --> 1974.24
that's pretty much just

1970.96 --> 1977.519
directly open to the ocean

1974.24 --> 1981.039
so that's not going to be salt

1977.519 --> 1981.039
carried down the river

1987.039 --> 1991.84
both river and a state okay i got that

1989.519 --> 1991.84
right

1999.44 --> 2006.48
so uh harp could you please

2003.12 --> 2006.4799999999998
please not

2007.76 --> 2013.84
constantly paste short sentences please

2011.519 --> 2019.84
just compact it together because this is

2013.84 --> 2019.84
not good for the optics of my chat

2021.76 --> 2025.279
the river has a salt line

2027.76 --> 2033.84
not just in the bay further up

2037.36 --> 2041.279
like does it start out saw

2041.919 --> 2045.919
does it actually start out salt very

2044.32 --> 2047.76
early in the beginning or is there like

2045.919 --> 2061.839
a point after which it becomes

2047.76 --> 2061.839
salt like how does this work

2086.839 --> 2090.639
hmm

2088.8 --> 2092.639
yeah i think i'm going to put a sweater

2090.639 --> 2103.839
as well it is

2092.639 --> 2103.839
a lot more chilly

2132.56 --> 2135.44
so that's better

2136.48 --> 2139.599
the river is tidal

2139.839 --> 2148.88
you keep saying the same thing over

2145.68 --> 2151.52
right my question is

2148.88 --> 2153.28
does the river just lead into the ocean

2151.52 --> 2154.64
and that's where the salt comes in the

2153.28 --> 2157.8390000000004
river

2154.64 --> 2160.0
or is it

2157.839 --> 2162.96
before it hits the ocean because

2160.0 --> 2165.28
whatever the water passes through this

2162.96 --> 2166.88
i don't know a salt pocket something i

2165.28 --> 2168.2400000000002
don't know that's what i'm trying to

2166.88 --> 2172.2400000000002
figure out here

2168.24 --> 2174.24
you keep on saying the same thing

2172.24 --> 2176.3999999999996
the tide is how the salt is in the river

2174.24 --> 2179.9199999999996
right so it's just because of the ocean

2176.4 --> 2179.92
so it's just the ocean

2181.28 --> 2188.4
i thought so i've never heard of that

2184.48 --> 2193.359
before that it wouldn't be partly salt

2188.4 --> 2193.359
because of the ocean it's always the

2198.839 --> 2215.839
ocean

2200.079 --> 2215.8390000000004
what what's wrong good seven

2233.52 --> 2243.839
all right

2255.839 --> 2261.92
right so anyway yeah my uh

2258.96 --> 2265.28
i guess my inquiry into antiquity and

2261.92 --> 2265.28
the flood still stands

2265.76 --> 2272.4
was it salt water that came down

2269.44 --> 2275.28
was it sweet water that came down it

2272.4 --> 2278.96
would make a difference there would be

2275.28 --> 2280.079
physical proof that would basically be

2278.96 --> 2284.2400000000002
left there

2280.079 --> 2286.96
throughout the ages

2284.24 --> 2288.4799999999996
especially if it would like penetrate

2286.96 --> 2292.079
places where

2288.48 --> 2292.56
normal rain water would never be able to

2292.079 --> 2295.76
get

2292.56 --> 2299.839
because then it would leave

2295.76 --> 2301.6800000000003
the salt where it entered

2299.839 --> 2303.04
and then it would dry up the salt would

2301.68 --> 2306.64
be left behind

2303.04 --> 2308.64
basically until the end times

2306.64 --> 2310.3199999999997
unless there was some kind of new flood

2308.64 --> 2314.56
but yeah that's

2310.32 --> 2317.6800000000003
no reason to believe that would happen

2314.56 --> 2317.68
not even the mud flood

2320.48 --> 2324.96
it was a mix in your opinion okay well

2322.8 --> 2327.119
great i'm not actually looking for

2324.96 --> 2327.52
opinions though i'm trying to figure out

2327.119 --> 2330.48
what

2327.52 --> 2330.96
actually happened because if it was a

2330.48 --> 2334.32
mix

2330.96 --> 2336.88
then there would still be salt left

2334.32 --> 2336.88
behind

2337.839 --> 2340.88
in places that would normally never be

2340.24 --> 2345.359
reached

2340.88 --> 2345.359
by water again ever since

2352.32 --> 2356.6400000000003
ground samples people ground samples

2358.24 --> 2362.3199999999997
it would be a worthy test to do

2365.68 --> 2369.2
like if you're going to go to these

2367.04 --> 2371.68
special cities

2369.2 --> 2374.0
get just the ground sample just on the

2371.68 --> 2376.24
ground inside of there

2374.0 --> 2377.359
doesn't don't mean like cut out a piece

2376.24 --> 2380.8799999999997
of rock

2377.359 --> 2381.2
the dust would be fine and then test it

2380.88 --> 2383.839
for

2381.2 --> 2383.839
salt content

2386.32 --> 2390.88
the mountains wash themselves

2394.839 --> 2397.839
what

2408.839 --> 2411.839
what

2428.8 --> 2435.599
oh by the way hello dutch sailor good to

2431.2 --> 2435.5989999999997
see you nathan oakley 1980 good to see

2436.839 --> 2439.839
you

2463.599 --> 2469.2000000000003
what are you talking about that's not

2466.96 --> 2471.359
the question

2469.2 --> 2473.839
i'm not asking where they're salt yeah

2471.359 --> 2476.88
of course salt mines

2473.839 --> 2481.839
i'm my question was about

2476.88 --> 2481.839
the flood water coming down

2484.96 --> 2491.119
because if it's all salt mines then

2488.88 --> 2493.599
the ocean would be salt because of the

2491.119 --> 2496.96
minerals on earth but my question was

2493.599 --> 2500.2400000000002
is was the flood water

2496.96 --> 2509.839
sweet water or was it salt

2500.24 --> 2509.839
what are the leads

2520.839 --> 2526.4
so

2522.8 --> 2530.079
but on the other hand like the flood was

2526.4 --> 2532.319
not just like a giant bucket being

2530.079 --> 2533.28
being let in right it wasn't like that

2532.319 --> 2537.2799999999997
it was just

2533.28 --> 2540.0
like endless incredible maximum rain

2537.28 --> 2541.44
right that's how it was described during

2540.0 --> 2544.64
noah

2541.44 --> 2544.64
just endless rain

2545.76 --> 2552.0
but rain is not so

2548.96 --> 2555.28
like rain system that's usually not

2552.0 --> 2556.16
salt because then it would be implied

2555.28 --> 2559.119
that it's moist

2556.16 --> 2560.56
in the air that somehow the moist in the

2559.119 --> 2562.839
air was maximized

2560.56 --> 2564.0789999999997
that would cause this constant

2562.839 --> 2568.88
rainforming

2564.079 --> 2568.88
but yeah moist doesn't carry salt

2569.599 --> 2575.599
so by that logic by that reference

2573.04 --> 2578.48
one should consider that the flood was

2575.599 --> 2581.119
all sweet water because

2578.48 --> 2582.16
if it wasn't literally dropped from a

2581.119 --> 2585.04
bucket

2582.16 --> 2586.72
or from the waters above that would then

2585.04 --> 2589.359
assume to be salt

2586.72 --> 2590.24
if it was just moist gathering and then

2589.359 --> 2592.96
condensing

2590.24 --> 2593.9199999999996
constantly dropping down enormous

2592.96 --> 2596.0
amounts of rain

2593.92 --> 2597.599
then it would have to be sweet water

2596.0 --> 2600.64
because

2597.599 --> 2603.28
water vapor doesn't carry salt

2600.64 --> 2603.839
where would that salt come from would

2603.28 --> 2606.8
have have

2603.839 --> 2608.0
god would have had to sprinkle it on the

2606.8 --> 2609.6800000000003
moist

2608.0 --> 2612.24
in order to achieve that doesn't make

2609.68 --> 2612.24
any sense

2613.52 --> 2618.0
yeah harp nothing not related to the

2618.839 --> 2621.839
argument

2627.52 --> 2634.72
just inquiring was the flood water was

2631.599 --> 2636.56
it sweet or was it salt

2634.72 --> 2638.7999999999997
and the evidence that would come from

2636.56 --> 2638.7999999999997
that

2646.839 --> 2649.839
what

2655.359 --> 2660.0
and i don't know steamy traveler never

2658.079 --> 2663.8390000000004
heard of that terminology

2660.0 --> 2663.839
elephant waves what

2666.96 --> 2677.839
above is sweet and blue is salt okay

2700.0 --> 2705.839
have people been to these cities you

2701.839 --> 2705.839
mean the uh

2707.28 --> 2710.0
like the one

2711.52 --> 2715.599
that steamy traveler posted the link to

2716.24 --> 2722.72
darin kuyo

2719.599 --> 2726.48
i haven't been there i don't know

2722.72 --> 2727.359
i've never met somebody in person that

2726.48 --> 2729.92
went there

2727.359 --> 2730.4
but yeah lots of people go there oh i

2729.92 --> 2732.56
might have

2730.4 --> 2735.28
yeah well jessup guy might have been

2732.56 --> 2735.2799999999997
there i don't know

2735.52 --> 2737.7599999999998
uh

2744.839 --> 2747.839
underground

2751.599 --> 2754.96
can you be more specific

2758.839 --> 2763.92
right

2760.319 --> 2766.48
the darinkuyu city is not completely

2763.92 --> 2769.599
underground

2766.48 --> 2773.119
it's like partial

2769.599 --> 2775.3590000000004
part of it is exposed

2773.119 --> 2777.359
because it's kind of like underground

2775.359 --> 2782.7999999999997
but

2777.359 --> 2782.7999999999997
up until the top up until top side

2786.839 --> 2789.839
so

2795.68 --> 2799.68
okay well stalin 8012 if you love that

2797.839 --> 2803.52
sort of thing there's a whole

2799.68 --> 2806.64
bunch of organized

2803.52 --> 2809.839
groups that go to those like monolithic

2806.64 --> 2812.0
places all over the world

2809.839 --> 2813.44
if you love to go there then do that

2812.0 --> 2815.92
right but yeah

2813.44 --> 2818.359
you gotta realize that you're now living

2815.92 --> 2822.8
in an age of

2818.359 --> 2828.64
neo-feudalistic covet lockdown [Â __Â ]

2822.8 --> 2828.6400000000003
so it's not going to be

2828.839 --> 2831.839
easy

2852.4 --> 2857.28
trying to think back if i've ever been

2854.559 --> 2862.559
to like a place like that

2857.28 --> 2862.559
because i think i have actually in spain

2864.64 --> 2870.319
if there is any in spain it just

2867.76 --> 2871.119
i remember being in some places that

2870.319 --> 2874.4
were very much

2871.119 --> 2875.6800000000003
like that but i might be misremembering

2874.4 --> 2878.1600000000003
i'm not sure

2875.68 --> 2880.48
i can't pinpoint it when and where it

2878.16 --> 2880.48
would be

2881.28 --> 2885.52
maybe just dreamed about those places i

2883.52 --> 2890.079
have dreamed about those types of plays

2885.52 --> 2893.119
because they had had fascinated me a lot

2890.079 --> 2893.119
even when i was young

2896.8 --> 2901.8390000000004
they were presented to me like fairy

2899.119 --> 2901.839
castles

2902.88 --> 2915.839
very weird

2919.04 --> 2923.359
hey zr1fc

2926.839 --> 2929.839
hello

2940.839 --> 2943.839
hmm

2949.2 --> 2952.7999999999997

2952.8 --> 2958.319
uh alhambra

2956.079 --> 2961.04
amazing place i would definitely

2958.319 --> 2961.04
remember that

2961.119 --> 2968.0
oh like running water everywhere it's so

2965.52 --> 2968.0
amazing

2968.48 --> 2972.0
like they have staircases that literally

2970.8 --> 2976.96
are waterfalls

2972.0 --> 2976.96
everywhere it's really astounding place

2980.079 --> 2983.04
and of course the

2983.359 --> 2986.72
sagrada familia

2987.68 --> 2994.16
and i've been on vacation summer

2990.079 --> 2994.1600000000003
vacation to spain many many times

2995.04 --> 2999.839
in my youth

3017.599 --> 3023.3590000000004
uh why would i be

3021.04 --> 3023.359
dude

3024.839 --> 3027.839
hello

3029.52 --> 3035.04
who gives a [Â __Â ] dude if if somebody

3032.64 --> 3041.839
wants to eat only meat

3035.04 --> 3041.839
well go for it let's see what happens

3042.4 --> 3046.48
why the hell would i be scared of that

3044.8 --> 3051.04
who gives a [Â __Â ]

3046.48 --> 3051.04
why would i be scared of anybody's diet

3051.119 --> 3055.839
it's their diet

3057.92 --> 3062.079
anybody should be scared it should be

3059.76 --> 3062.079
them

3062.4 --> 3083.839
or not

3068.0 --> 3083.839
you know time will tell

3100.8 --> 3104.7200000000003
okay iron fe that really sucks

3107.76 --> 3113.599
like why it's a bunch of freaking

3111.28 --> 3118.96
bastards why would they just destroy

3113.599 --> 3118.96
everything that is so satanic

3119.599 --> 3127.3590000000004
it's people that do that [Â __Â ] man

3124.96 --> 3129.76
i don't think they're resting in a good

3127.359 --> 3129.7599999999998
place

3130.24 --> 3136.4799999999996
like destroyers of information

3133.52 --> 3136.48
destroyers of

3136.88 --> 3142.48
of enlightenment it's like

3140.319 --> 3145.2799999999997
hiding information is one thing but

3142.48 --> 3147.68
destroying it

3145.28 --> 3147.6800000000003
like that

3150.4 --> 3156.96
and with information i mean

3153.92 --> 3159.599
like just things that have happened that

3156.96 --> 3159.599
are out there

3161.119 --> 3167.839
the real history maybe convoluting it

3176.079 --> 3181.8390000000004
yes i've heard that george sanford

3182.0 --> 3186.72
there's a war they usually there's like

3184.72 --> 3189.52
oh everybody's afraid then they blow

3186.72 --> 3194.0
up [Â __Â ] completely unnecessary because

3189.52 --> 3209.839
they just want to get it out of the way

3194.0 --> 3209.839
it's beyond repulsive

3220.839 --> 3237.839
what what is that got to do with it

3238.66 --> 3241.9289999999996
[Music]

3249.68 --> 3252.8999999999996
[Music]

3286.22 --> 3289.39
[Music]

3290.839 --> 3293.839
right

3332.079 --> 3335.8390000000004
so you got anything

3336.0 --> 3340.48
less depressing to bring to the table

3338.079 --> 3340.48
perhaps

3346.799 --> 3351.28
or are you in one of those moods like oh

3348.96 --> 3352.96
no everything is destroyed everything

3351.28 --> 3354.96
will be taken away it's a hell

3352.96 --> 3355.599
intelligent hell is that what your mood

3354.96 --> 3358.96
is right now

3355.599 --> 3360.96
george sanford can't exactly say i

3358.96 --> 3377.28
appreciated

3360.96 --> 3379.599
what you were doing yesterday in my chat

3377.28 --> 3379.599
all right

3383.04 --> 3390.4
face that was gonna stop in your

3384.799 --> 3392.0
province good for you

3390.4 --> 3393.92
not gonna make much of a difference

3392.0 --> 3396.0
though because you know lots of people

3393.92 --> 3399.92
are still gonna wear it

3396.0 --> 3403.2
no matter what they'll wear one

3399.92 --> 3405.839
dying of their last shot

3403.2 --> 3405.839
they will

3406.24 --> 3410.4799999999996
and others will have never worn a mask

3410.64 --> 3419.839
they don't give a [Â __Â ] like me

3427.92 --> 3431.599
dude i don't care

3431.96 --> 3436.88
zr1fc i don't care about this stupid guy

3435.76 --> 3439.6800000000003
in his diet

3436.88 --> 3440.96
and is playing games like who gives a

3439.68 --> 3443.04
[Â __Â ]

3440.96 --> 3446.319
hello welcome to the flat earth early

3443.04 --> 3448.64
bird show

3446.319 --> 3449.599
where we don't talk about random

3448.64 --> 3451.68
unrelated

3449.599 --> 3461.839
people on the internet that literally

3451.68 --> 3461.839
aren't interesting

3469.46 --> 3472.61
[Music]

3486.839 --> 3489.839
and

3492.96 --> 3503.839
huh okay that sounds interesting dutch

3495.04 --> 3503.839
stay there

3504.319 --> 3511.52
yeah good luck with that don't

3507.839 --> 3511.52
hurry it up too quick though

3513.04 --> 3520.96
i would just let it sink for a while

3516.24 --> 3520.9599999999996
don't push it too quickly or might flip

3528.839 --> 3531.839
back

3542.839 --> 3545.839
so

3552.64 --> 3559.839
man i'm hungry

3566.88 --> 3573.839
hey james mason good to see you

3576.64 --> 3581.44
yeah what is up with these votes today

3582.16 --> 3586.799
come on guys give me a rogan's up

3585.119 --> 3588.6400000000003
everybody in chat there's like a lot of

3586.799 --> 3590.64
people here in chat

3588.64 --> 3592.4
i think we've had a decent conversation

3590.64 --> 3601.839
so far give the rogans up

3592.4 --> 3601.839
because the votes are being screwy again

3602.96 --> 3607.119
right dutch sailor yeah that's a good

3604.72 --> 3607.1189999999997
start

3610.4 --> 3618.079
four years okay well that

3614.88 --> 3618.079
that's a lot of time

3625.68 --> 3630.8799999999997
but that's good because you really need

3627.52 --> 3634.72
most of the time to get used to

3630.88 --> 3636.799
basically be able to

3634.72 --> 3638.16
deflect the conditioning from the

3636.799 --> 3641.04
outside because there is

3638.16 --> 3642.3999999999996
so much reinforcement of this [Â __Â ] that

3641.04 --> 3646.16
that's going to be the first

3642.4 --> 3646.96
obstacle is that you need to deal with

3646.16 --> 3649.2799999999997
all the

3646.96 --> 3652.0
conditioning reinforcement out there

3649.28 --> 3654.4
that's the toughest part

3652.0 --> 3656.319
and that requires a lot of time so if

3654.4 --> 3657.92
you kind of like carefully worked it in

3656.319 --> 3661.2799999999997
there

3657.92 --> 3671.839
then yeah you might actually be able to

3661.28 --> 3671.8390000000004
completely get him out of it well done

3673.44 --> 3676.559
concentration problems

3681.76 --> 3686.96
yeah that's a tough one but is it like

3688.0 --> 3692.319
is it metabolic or is it like something

3690.4 --> 3695.359
physical

3692.319 --> 3695.839
is it because of brain damage vaccine

3695.359 --> 3698.48
[Â __Â ]

3695.839 --> 3713.839
or is he not eating too healthy because

3698.48 --> 3713.839
that matters a lot

3721.92 --> 3728.079
right so right

3725.28 --> 3730.2400000000002
when you're trying to elevate people to

3728.079 --> 3733.8390000000004
a higher conscious

3730.24 --> 3734.72
use drugs almost that what does that

3733.839 --> 3738.0789999999997
mean

3734.72 --> 3742.0
i do that right that that

3738.079 --> 3745.52
i smoke that's drugs use a speed oh

3742.0 --> 3748.72
jesus oh yeah well no

3745.52 --> 3755.839
[Â __Â ] you have concentration problems

3748.72 --> 3755.839
ugh dude

3760.96 --> 3763.2
like

3764.4 --> 3770.2400000000002
why do you like him

3768.0 --> 3772.4
as a conversation partner you want

3770.24 --> 3773.1189999999997
somebody to talk about flat earth with

3772.4 --> 3776.64
is that

3773.119 --> 3783.839
why because otherwise

3776.64 --> 3783.839
like i don't get it

3790.16 --> 3797.839
like to take it he's like an adhd

3793.52 --> 3797.839
guy all that is a kid okay

3801.28 --> 3804.559
i'm not saying that if you use speed

3803.119 --> 3806.2400000000002
you're evil

3804.559 --> 3811.8390000000004
if he was like it didn't have a good

3806.24 --> 3811.839
heart then why would you even try

3816.799 --> 3839.839
he has to stop with right

3824.48 --> 3839.839
oh good luck with that

3840.799 --> 3846.24
yeah the problem about speed if you if

3843.359 --> 3850.64
you literally get addicted to it

3846.24 --> 3853.68
is that it really really burns you out

3850.64 --> 3856.64
and that burning out it doesn't unburn

3853.68 --> 3856.64
that's the problem

3858.079 --> 3862.319
and now if you have like oh i want to

3860.24 --> 3864.24
party and i use speed

3862.319 --> 3866.88
that's not good right but yeah that's

3864.24 --> 3871.2
not going to be every day

3866.88 --> 3874.4
if you really use it every day

3871.2 --> 3876.96
you are going to have serious damage

3874.4 --> 3878.799
that can that cannot normally be

3876.96 --> 3883.44
restored it's going to completely

3878.799 --> 3886.0
reform how how you manifest

3883.44 --> 3886.0
it's bad

3887.44 --> 3894.88
right and it would require a complete

3890.64 --> 3897.359
miracle and absolute zealous dedication

3894.88 --> 3898.6400000000003
to even attempt to undo that

3897.359 --> 3901.68
and it's probably not going to be

3898.64 --> 3904.72
successful it might be

3901.68 --> 3909.1189999999997
right the proper supplements it's just

3904.72 --> 3912.16
unbelievable tough

3909.119 --> 3914.4
like especially speed

3912.16 --> 3915.359
like there's a lot of things that are

3914.4 --> 3917.6800000000003
very addictive

3915.359 --> 3918.48
and bad for you very mentally tough but

3917.68 --> 3921.44
speed

3918.48 --> 3922.96
is like it's completely chemical and

3921.44 --> 3926.88
it's really

3922.96 --> 3926.88
really bad for your nervous system

3928.319 --> 3933.44
cbd oil well that that'll probably help

3931.119 --> 3933.44
some

3935.52 --> 3938.72
maybe some iodine

3939.68 --> 3943.9199999999996
like you'd have to bring out the full

3941.359 --> 3945.359
package to basically start regrowing the

3943.92 --> 3948.48
brain

3945.359 --> 3948.48
because that's what it does

3949.2 --> 3957.839
it shrinks it if i if i'm not mistaken

3953.92 --> 3960.88
it's just don't never

3957.839 --> 3961.599
ever get addicted to that [Â __Â ] oh they

3960.88 --> 3965.52
tell you they

3961.599 --> 3967.52
have adhd well [Â __Â ] em that just means

3965.52 --> 3970.88
you're more of a person than them and

3967.52 --> 3970.88
they're too freaking slow

3971.039 --> 3975.5200000000004
just don't use it don't

3977.52 --> 3982.559
right i had adhd supposedly especially

3981.039 --> 3985.3590000000004
when i was like a pre-teen

3982.559 --> 3987.76
now [Â __Â ] a teenage young teenager i was

3985.359 --> 3991.2799999999997
very hyperactive

3987.76 --> 3996.1600000000003
and yeah never ever touch the stuff

3991.28 --> 3996.1600000000003
ever it's terrible

3997.68 --> 4001.44
i've never seen it have a good influence

3999.68 --> 4004.64
on anybody would always be

4001.44 --> 4005.28
bad freak bad vibes like every time it's

4004.64 --> 4008.72
just

4005.28 --> 4021.8390000000004
bad vibes literally

4008.72 --> 4021.839
bad vibes nothing good about it ever

4029.119 --> 4038.96
you do not believe in adhd well

4035.2 --> 4042.799
it's adhd

4038.96 --> 4046.2400000000002
is another way of being it's another

4042.799 --> 4046.96
frequency of function problem is though

4046.24 --> 4050.72
is that it's

4046.96 --> 4054.799
often very hard to interface

4050.72 --> 4057.5989999999997
with regular minded people

4054.799 --> 4058.88
they grow impatient and especially bad

4057.599 --> 4062.2400000000002
habits because of

4058.88 --> 4066.559
boredom pure unadulterated

4062.24 --> 4069.2
boredom adhd people develop

4066.559 --> 4070.48
specific social skills to get on

4069.2 --> 4073.9199999999996
people's nerves

4070.48 --> 4076.96
because they're so [Â __Â ] bored

4073.92 --> 4080.48
you can't believe it right

4076.96 --> 4083.599
adhd people need extreme

4080.48 --> 4086.64
challenges extreme not

4083.599 --> 4090.7200000000003
a challenge an extreme challenge

4086.64 --> 4095.1189999999997
they need that or they'll go nuts

4090.72 --> 4095.1189999999997
trust me i know all about it

4097.52 --> 4104.0
thank god over time i've managed to

4100.799 --> 4105.839
yeah get it under control i'm a lot

4104.0 --> 4108.96
less hyper active than i used to be i'm

4105.839 --> 4113.199
actually kind of slow compared to

4108.96 --> 4116.159
like 30 years ago

4113.199 --> 4118.719
but i'm fine with that the activity is

4116.159 --> 4122.719
still there it's just that the entire

4118.719 --> 4122.719
process is less compacted

4122.96 --> 4127.359
and i've like actively trained myself

4125.359 --> 4128.56
just be patient be patient be patient

4127.359 --> 4132.799
with everything like

4128.56 --> 4134.88
completely disconnect my speed of things

4132.799 --> 4137.92
with the rest of the entire freaking

4134.88 --> 4143.759
world managed to do that

4137.92 --> 4145.839
very isolating but yeah because of that

4143.759 --> 4147.759
i have been able to just properly

4145.839 --> 4150.64
develop myself

4147.759 --> 4150.64
in a mental way

4154.88 --> 4158.0
all right thanks now in 80 12. thanks

4157.12 --> 4161.839
for being here

4158.0 --> 4161.839
glad you enjoyed it

4165.679 --> 4168.4800000000005
scrap metal

4169.6 --> 4176.1990000000005
yeah that that is just too typical dude

4173.92 --> 4178.96
it's like so typical that like

4176.199 --> 4181.5199999999995
immediately now

4178.96 --> 4183.12
owen benjamin comes to mind because he

4181.52 --> 4186.159000000001
talked about that [Â __Â ]

4183.12 --> 4187.839
like white people he's a white guy you

4186.159 --> 4190.96
don't even have to tell me i know

4187.839 --> 4195.36
because it's always a white guy

4190.96 --> 4197.28
who's on meth and is looking for copper

4195.36 --> 4200.48
pipes

4197.28 --> 4203.36
isn't he right scrap metal

4200.48 --> 4204.5599999999995
that includes copper yeah that's ex not

4203.36 --> 4209.04
the only one dude

4204.56 --> 4210.96
there's a lot of people like that a lot

4209.04 --> 4217.84
and for some reason in the netherlands

4210.96 --> 4217.84
there's plenty

4223.28 --> 4227.92
pain is no excuse for drug abuse yeah

4228.84 --> 4231.84
but

4237.199 --> 4240.719
dude once you become dependent on the

4239.36 --> 4244.0
specific drug state

4240.719 --> 4245.52
just the function it's specifically

4244.0 --> 4247.04
about the functioning right because you

4245.52 --> 4250.0
can use i

4247.04 --> 4252.64
don't recommend it don't do drugs if you

4250.0 --> 4257.48
use drugs like kind of to relax

4252.64 --> 4260.4800000000005
that's different if you specifically

4257.48 --> 4263.599999999999
specifically use drugs to

4260.48 --> 4266.48
function right that's where you have a

4263.6 --> 4268.96
big big problem

4266.48 --> 4270.4
because you use it to function you can

4268.96 --> 4271.199
only function with it and in the

4270.4 --> 4274.4
meantime

4271.199 --> 4275.44
it's it's gonna drag on you it's gonna

4274.4 --> 4278.719
change you it's

4275.44 --> 4281.36
and then you just become permanently

4278.719 --> 4286.159
addicted if you use drugs to function

4281.36 --> 4290.639999999999
you become permanently addicted

4286.159 --> 4290.639999999999
right that's when you're totally [Â __Â ]

4292.08 --> 4294.719
learn this

4296.56 --> 4302.280000000001
and that's by the way any drug any

4299.6 --> 4305.280000000001
that includes pain medication

4302.28 --> 4305.28
antidepressant

4305.44 --> 4312.08
even like allergy

4308.48 --> 4315.199
you become dependent to

4312.08 --> 4318.08
function like you don't do it

4315.199 --> 4321.44
and then you fear everything collapses

4318.08 --> 4321.44
then you have a problem

4321.6 --> 4326.320000000001
then you're literally paying with your

4324.08 --> 4330.159
health and your ability

4326.32 --> 4332.799999999999
to get by and that's a bad situation in

4330.159 --> 4332.799999999999
my opinion

4333.679 --> 4337.76
he stopped drinking alco yeah dutch

4335.84 --> 4343.84
sailor

4337.76 --> 4343.84
yes he did

4355.04 --> 4358.4
right oh we know that about beer well so

4357.199 --> 4362.08
do i

4358.4 --> 4365.679
i still drink beer like every day but i

4362.08 --> 4367.28
don't i don't go take a drink before i

4365.679 --> 4372.8
go to work

4367.28 --> 4372.8
i don't need it to loosen up no i use it

4373.44 --> 4378.48
to chill out to be a little loose with

4376.8 --> 4381.679
my bros

4378.48 --> 4382.5599999999995
or just watching something fun not being

4381.679 --> 4385.4400000000005
like oh i

4382.56 --> 4387.4400000000005
have to be all all focused right that's

4385.44 --> 4391.04
how i use it

4387.44 --> 4393.36
and that's yeah

4391.04 --> 4394.32
that doesn't do the same thing because

4393.36 --> 4397.44
i'm not like

4394.32 --> 4399.04
super focused as i'm using alcohol

4397.44 --> 4401.04
because i'm using it to

4399.04 --> 4404.4
achieve something right so then it

4401.04 --> 4407.44
doesn't get to rewire me

4404.4 --> 4410.639999999999
in condensed mode

4407.44 --> 4412.0
in high frequency building right because

4410.64 --> 4414.159000000001
when you specifically do

4412.0 --> 4415.04
that and you're under influence then

4414.159 --> 4420.799999999999
it's going to

4415.04 --> 4424.0
influence how you get wired as they say

4420.8 --> 4429.04
that's the difference if you use drugs

4424.0 --> 4432.48
to function you got a problem

4429.04 --> 4436.8
if you only use it to kind of like oh

4432.48 --> 4436.799999999999
chill out you could still get a problem

4437.12 --> 4443.76
right but it won't pro it probably will

4440.64 --> 4443.76
be less dramatic

4445.28 --> 4449.759999999999
like with my alcohol use i can

4447.76 --> 4451.1990000000005
technically stop it yeah i would feel a

4449.76 --> 4454.2390000000005
little shitty

4451.199 --> 4456.08
maybe or maybe i'd be like okay well i'm

4454.239 --> 4458.879999999999
done with this for now i'm just gonna

4456.08 --> 4460.239
amuse myself in another way don't need

4458.88 --> 4462.64
it for now

4460.239 --> 4463.36
right but that's not the same as if i

4462.64 --> 4466.84
would drink

4463.36 --> 4468.799999999999
literally during like a stream

4466.84 --> 4473.6
constantly

4468.8 --> 4473.6
and build on it because i don't do that

4475.04 --> 4483.84
maybe i do it a little with cannabis

4478.48 --> 4483.839999999999
because yeah

4486.719 --> 4490.08
but yeah with cannabis

4490.239 --> 4499.599999999999
it's complicated

4497.52 --> 4500.96
i don't really even smoke cannabis to

4499.6 --> 4503.679
get baked

4500.96 --> 4503.679
like they say

4504.08 --> 4509.76
i get it use it to go in the zone but by

4506.88 --> 4512.719
that standard and technically now

4509.76 --> 4513.6
giving you example of my life and how

4512.719 --> 4516.64
i've kind of

4513.6 --> 4518.400000000001
well broken that rule but i did it only

4516.64 --> 4518.88
with cannabis the cannabis is the only

4518.4 --> 4522.239
thing i

4518.88 --> 4525.84
allow myself to use in relation to

4522.239 --> 4525.839999999999
actual functioning

4529.36 --> 4539.839999999999
i don't allow that with beer

4545.76 --> 4553.84
wow that iron fe that's crazy number

4578.84 --> 4581.84
whoa

4582.32 --> 4595.84
jesus ditch dutch sailor dude

4586.32 --> 4595.84
okay the [Â __Â ]

4598.4 --> 4611.759999999999
that's crazy

4609.28 --> 4613.92
but do you also know who lied to him

4611.76 --> 4617.679
about it because that seems like the guy

4613.92 --> 4617.679
that he should be going after

4618.239 --> 4623.839999999999
that's crazy man

4636.64 --> 4641.04
right there was tension in the air right

4639.36 --> 4642.719
that's how you know it something like

4641.04 --> 4646.4
that could happen right

4642.719 --> 4648.32
there's like the really off tension

4646.4 --> 4650.799999999999
yeah that's usually the time you want to

4648.32 --> 4653.12
get out of everybody's way

4650.8 --> 4654.719
i've had a few moments like that in my

4653.12 --> 4656.96
life

4654.719 --> 4658.159
and i would sense it like really like

4656.96 --> 4662.84
okay i have to be

4658.159 --> 4665.839999999999
very careful now because [Â __Â ] could go

4662.84 --> 4665.84
wrong

4675.199 --> 4679.12
responsible for attempted murder what no

4678.239 --> 4681.5199999999995
but that's

4679.12 --> 4685.599999999999
a little more more complicated like did

4681.52 --> 4688.080000000001
that the guy that told him you did that

4685.6 --> 4690.0
did he also encourage him to go after

4688.08 --> 4692.239
you

4690.0 --> 4695.199
or did that just come from him

4692.239 --> 4695.199
overreacting

4695.36 --> 4700.32
right kind of matters

4702.0 --> 4705.6
because if it was just him overreacting

4704.239 --> 4708.879999999999
then it's basically still

4705.6 --> 4708.88
his issue

4710.08 --> 4713.04
he's just crazy

4715.6 --> 4719.1990000000005
now that's the don't have to say that

4718.0 --> 4722.239
specific if he just

4719.199 --> 4725.12
said get him

4722.239 --> 4728.48
that's already sending him your way

4725.12 --> 4732.08
basically right and then he is

4728.48 --> 4734.0
partially responsible perhaps especially

4732.08 --> 4736.64
if the guy was really all

4734.0 --> 4738.32
in rage like i'm gonna kill him yeah if

4736.64 --> 4740.88
he then sends him after you

4738.32 --> 4741.44
then he is partially responsible anyway

4740.88 --> 4749.84
it's

4741.44 --> 4749.839999999999
the technicalities

4775.6 --> 4779.4400000000005
no that's not attempt to murder that's

4777.76 --> 4784.64
assault

4779.44 --> 4784.639999999999
if you're not wounded it's that yeah

4784.8 --> 4788.08
unless he like really was like like i

4787.6 --> 4790.320000000001
like

4788.08 --> 4792.08
really aiming like for your throat or

4790.32 --> 4794.799999999999
your heart

4792.08 --> 4798.08
and you almost yeah then it could be

4794.8 --> 4799.84
seen as attempted murder but

4798.08 --> 4801.92
if he's just like i'm gonna get you i'm

4799.84 --> 4805.84
gonna get you and swinging wildly yeah

4801.92 --> 4805.84
that's not

4808.639 --> 4814.2390000000005
right right how do you translate that

4815.76 --> 4820.96
attempt a deadly assault right

4824.8 --> 4830.320000000001
you just chair jesus dude

4828.32 --> 4833.84
okay well i'm glad you got out of it and

4830.32 --> 4833.84
scared that's crazy man

4835.36 --> 4837.759999999999
sheesh

4840.08 --> 4843.28
well it's good you have a witness man

4842.719 --> 4847.84
that's

4843.28 --> 4847.84
you're really lucky with that

4848.8 --> 4853.4400000000005
otherwise things might become really

4850.719 --> 4853.44
complicated

4853.92 --> 4858.2390000000005
anyway yeah crazy i'm good

4859.36 --> 4862.96
you need to move out of this place

4863.04 --> 4868.32
maybe look if the guy's going to jail

4866.239 --> 4870.239
then maybe it's not going to be an issue

4868.32 --> 4872.4
anymore

4870.239 --> 4874.0
oh it's not the only thing going down

4872.4 --> 4875.679
okay well yeah

4874.0 --> 4877.92
well maybe you do need to get out of

4875.679 --> 4877.92
there

4884.08 --> 4888.88
it's weird though now because weren't

4886.639 --> 4892.159000000001
you the guy that offered me to

4888.88 --> 4903.12
a place to live now i'm kind of glad i

4892.159 --> 4907.04
didn't take it

4903.12 --> 4907.04
right well hey apes

4913.84 --> 4917.84
don't worry about it

4918.159 --> 4922.48
yeah well iron if it should work out

4920.56 --> 4925.360000000001
he's already been arrested and

4922.48 --> 4931.839999999999
that is being charged so yeah you know

4925.36 --> 4931.839999999999
if he was still like on the loose

4932.8 --> 4939.360000000001
but yeah shocking man that's crazy

4936.239 --> 4941.28
getting attacked with a butcher knife

4939.36 --> 4945.839999999999
defending yourself with the chair

4941.28 --> 4945.84
that gets all cut up that's [Â __Â ] up

4949.84 --> 4954.159000000001
man i've never been through anything

4952.08 --> 4956.32
like that

4954.159 --> 4958.96
but that's because when i see somebody

4956.32 --> 4961.5199999999995
that is like that

4958.96 --> 4963.28
the first thing you just do is just run

4961.52 --> 4966.56
away

4963.28 --> 4970.0
or literally find a blunt

4966.56 --> 4973.84
object and sneak attack and hit him on

4970.0 --> 4973.84
the head

4974.639 --> 4978.159000000001
if that's even possible but probably

4977.04 --> 4981.04
just running away

4978.159 --> 4982.638999999999
right away is usually the best thing to

4981.04 --> 4984.639
do

4982.639 --> 4987.84
because i have seen a couple of people

4984.639 --> 4987.84
going nuts

4990.719 --> 4994.4
ugh i think

4994.56 --> 4999.6
it's a bit fuzzy the memory

4997.679 --> 5002.08
but yeah nobody ever directly attacked

4999.6 --> 5004.88
me i would always be able to quickly get

5002.08 --> 5009.04
out of it using just my

5004.88 --> 5012.32
calmness and my ability to help somebody

5009.04 --> 5012.32
figure out what they're doing

5013.76 --> 5017.6
like i've had situation where people

5015.84 --> 5019.04
would basically punch me because they

5017.6 --> 5020.320000000001
thought i did something and i would be

5019.04 --> 5023.5199999999995
like no

5020.32 --> 5027.199
like literally non-responsive like

5023.52 --> 5030.320000000001
no you're mistaken it's okay

5027.199 --> 5033.44
i forgive you just don't do it again

5030.32 --> 5033.44
that would help great

5034.96 --> 5038.08
like even if i got punched in the face

5036.96 --> 5040.4800000000005
now of course

5038.08 --> 5042.0
if it was like a really giant guy that

5040.48 --> 5045.28
did that then i'd probably

5042.0 --> 5048.96
not be okay i'd probably have a big

5045.28 --> 5048.96
headache or even a concussion

5049.36 --> 5053.04
but thank god that never happened

5053.92 --> 5059.92
just don't piss off really big people

5057.52 --> 5070.4800000000005
by the way that's usually much more

5059.92 --> 5084.32
tough than you'd imagine

5070.48 --> 5086.5599999999995
right touch sailor yeah

5084.32 --> 5087.36
right and if you don't want to become an

5086.56 --> 5089.76
addict then

5087.36 --> 5091.92
take into consideration what i said

5089.76 --> 5092.639
right because there's many people that

5091.92 --> 5095.679
might

5092.639 --> 5097.04
use like some party drugs sometimes and

5095.679 --> 5100.56
it's risky

5097.04 --> 5100.56
as long as you keep in mind

5101.679 --> 5108.96
as long as you can function

5105.28 --> 5109.92
function without it then you have a lot

5108.96 --> 5112.719
better chance

5109.92 --> 5115.36
of living with it without becoming a

5112.719 --> 5118.56
total addict and getting damaged by it

5115.36 --> 5119.5199999999995
it's a big risk it's always going to be

5118.56 --> 5122.4800000000005
a big risk with

5119.52 --> 5124.8
especially with things hard drugs

5122.48 --> 5125.44
especially meth meth is very dangerous

5124.8 --> 5128.400000000001
stuff

5125.44 --> 5128.4
very toxic

5132.8 --> 5141.84
uh yeah that's that's fine dude

5136.88 --> 5141.84
the crazy story but yeah that's okay

5142.8 --> 5146.56
shock for two days you can imagine

5146.88 --> 5150.96
yeah that that real that sort of thing

5149.04 --> 5154.48
really gets on your adrenaline

5150.96 --> 5154.88
levels and that keeps echoing for a

5154.48 --> 5158.08
while

5154.88 --> 5158.08
yeah i can't imagine man

5161.45 --> 5167.679
[Music]

5164.159 --> 5170.32
remember too when you're in shock

5167.679 --> 5171.84
and after echo you need more water

5170.32 --> 5176.799999999999
remember that

5171.84 --> 5182.400000000001
because adrenaline that really

5176.8 --> 5185.52
yeah you need water

5182.4 --> 5185.92
like if you don't notice then you can

5185.52 --> 5189.1990000000005
get

5185.92 --> 5191.12
really unbelievably thirsty suddenly

5189.199 --> 5197.36
it's not very pleasant so always keep

5191.12 --> 5200.96
water at hand

5197.36 --> 5204.159
right yeah because adrenaline totally

5200.96 --> 5204.159
sucks the water out of you

5208.159 --> 5213.36
right could not sleep that's normal dude

5211.6 --> 5215.76
if you have an assault on your life yeah

5213.36 --> 5218.08
you're not gonna sleep for at least 24

5215.76 --> 5218.08
hours

5219.679 --> 5227.6
what can you do well i have some tips

5224.159 --> 5230.96
those are sounds crazy maybe but there's

5227.6 --> 5233.76
hot lines for this for victims of

5230.96 --> 5238.2390000000005
attacks specifically for this

5233.76 --> 5240.4800000000005
right they're specifically

5238.239 --> 5243.199
trained to deal with people in that

5240.48 --> 5244.5599999999995
situation where you like i can't sleep

5243.199 --> 5247.12
i'm so restless i'm

5244.56 --> 5249.120000000001
i don't know what to do help me right

5247.12 --> 5252.4
that's what those specific like

5249.12 --> 5254.5599999999995
trauma hotlines are for

5252.4 --> 5256.719
don't feel silly for using it when

5254.56 --> 5258.159000000001
you're in that state

5256.719 --> 5260.88
because that's specifically what they're

5258.159 --> 5262.719
designed for right they're not like oh

5260.88 --> 5265.28
little helpless you no they're

5262.719 --> 5266.0
specifically there to help you through

5265.28 --> 5268.719
the

5266.0 --> 5269.36
the physical response of the trauma

5268.719 --> 5281.84
right

5269.36 --> 5281.839999999999
and the mental reflections on it

5284.639 --> 5289.1990000000005
uh okay yeah james man

5292.96 --> 5295.84
right

5323.679 --> 5327.76
well look that sailor if you don't have

5325.679 --> 5330.639
to like to call the police to have them

5327.76 --> 5332.400000000001
show up and protect you with guns

5330.639 --> 5335.28
then you could just call the

5332.4 --> 5338.799999999999
neighborhood police the vagans

5335.28 --> 5342.0
just lay it out they are

5338.8 --> 5344.08
much better equipped also they might

5342.0 --> 5345.6
point at point to you like oh you want

5344.08 --> 5348.639
to call a trauma line

5345.6 --> 5351.52
or they will do it themselves sometimes

5348.639 --> 5353.52
and they will be able to advise you even

5351.52 --> 5355.040000000001
though you're still very jittery from

5353.52 --> 5357.679
the experience

5355.04 --> 5359.6
so that's what i recommend don't

5357.679 --> 5361.679
necessarily have to call the emergency

5359.6 --> 5363.679
unless you like help i need

5361.679 --> 5366.2390000000005
somebody to protect me he won't stop

5363.679 --> 5368.159
coming after me right

5366.239 --> 5370.0
there's like outside of the door waiting

5368.159 --> 5373.36
for me to come out yeah then you want to

5370.0 --> 5373.36
call the emergency police

5373.44 --> 5377.759999999999
but otherwise if he's already disengaged

5376.4 --> 5380.5599999999995
then you just want to call the

5377.76 --> 5384.320000000001
neighborhood cop

5380.56 --> 5384.320000000001
the vacation anyway

5386.48 --> 5389.839999999999
it was not his no but it is his fault

5388.639 --> 5392.4800000000005
dude

5389.84 --> 5394.4800000000005
he's the one assaulting it is his fault

5392.48 --> 5394.718999999999
even if it's based on a misunderstanding

5394.48 --> 5397.199
it

5394.719 --> 5398.8
is his fault he's the one that's allowed

5397.199 --> 5401.12
himself to go there

5398.8 --> 5403.12
it is his fault don't say don't make

5401.12 --> 5407.84
excuses for that

5403.12 --> 5407.84
just because somebody lied

5408.08 --> 5413.76
is just a false pretext he engaged in

5411.12 --> 5413.76
the action

5416.48 --> 5420.32
it doesn't matter the motivation he let

5418.4 --> 5422.719
himself go in a way that is

5420.32 --> 5425.5199999999995
unjustifiable there's no excuse for that

5422.719 --> 5425.52
sort of assault

5432.84 --> 5435.84
right

5439.97 --> 5449.84
[Music]

5441.44 --> 5449.839999999999
it doesn't matter

5468.08 --> 5475.5199999999995
well maybe you should just lay off

5472.0 --> 5479.199
forgiveness until perhaps he

5475.52 --> 5482.719
sometime in the future some some they

5479.199 --> 5484.5599999999995
come to you and actually apologizes for

5482.719 --> 5488.2390000000005
his insane behavior

5484.56 --> 5492.2390000000005
or attempt something like that right

5488.239 --> 5492.239
like he's why would you forgive him

5497.679 --> 5501.84
if you forgive somebody that doesn't

5499.28 --> 5505.84
even recognize what they did

5501.84 --> 5505.84
then he might just do it again

5506.88 --> 5510.96
i don't know maybe that's not the

5508.96 --> 5513.199
context of forgive that you

5510.96 --> 5513.199
meant

5516.08 --> 5520.719
you won't seem like forever right well

5522.639 --> 5527.04
i wouldn't forgive him because he did do

5525.12 --> 5528.4
wrong and that's just wrong there's no

5527.04 --> 5530.48
reason to forgive

5528.4 --> 5532.0
an assault like that even if it is

5530.48 --> 5535.839999999999
through false information it's

5532.0 --> 5537.28
crazy right now hypothetically let's

5535.84 --> 5540.56
just say

5537.28 --> 5541.92
he just found his little kid murdered or

5540.56 --> 5544.8
something right

5541.92 --> 5546.639
and then he thought you did it and came

5544.8 --> 5550.4800000000005
after you to assault you

5546.639 --> 5553.12
right now there

5550.48 --> 5555.12
i would then forgive them because yeah i

5553.12 --> 5557.599999999999
imagine if something like that to me

5555.12 --> 5558.4
happened to me i would go berserk right

5557.6 --> 5561.52
if i

5558.4 --> 5562.96
right that's different it's just a

5561.52 --> 5565.1990000000005
freaking bike

5562.96 --> 5566.159
why the hell would you try to kill

5565.199 --> 5569.919999999999
somebody

5566.159 --> 5572.719
for stealing your bike that's insane

5569.92 --> 5574.0
right that's completely nuts nuts don't

5572.719 --> 5576.2390000000005
touch the kid no i

5574.0 --> 5579.36
i mean it it's just a hypothetical

5576.239 --> 5581.04
example right to compare

5579.36 --> 5584.48
why the hell would you kill somebody

5581.04 --> 5584.48
over a bike that's insane

5585.199 --> 5588.879999999999
there's no justification for that

5586.96 --> 5592.88
there's no reason to forgive such

5588.88 --> 5592.88
action because it's insane

5595.199 --> 5599.5199999999995
doesn't matter who he attacks if he

5597.28 --> 5603.84
attacked the real bike thief

5599.52 --> 5603.84
it's still insane

5606.639 --> 5610.88
right now if you found out who stole

5609.199 --> 5611.28
your bike and you think like oh i'm

5610.88 --> 5613.679
gonna

5611.28 --> 5615.84
look him up and then giving him a proper

5613.679 --> 5617.84
beating

5615.84 --> 5618.88
necessarily so hard that he would end up

5617.84 --> 5622.639
in the hospital

5618.88 --> 5624.2390000000005
yeah i'd say okay okay it's a little

5622.639 --> 5628.400000000001
rough

5624.239 --> 5631.04
but at least yeah it's not a completely

5628.4 --> 5633.599999999999
insane response see

5631.04 --> 5634.719
it's by the way still illegal to do that

5633.6 --> 5636.400000000001
so

5634.719 --> 5638.639
don't recommend you do it i'm just

5636.4 --> 5639.28
saying like judgment wise yeah i would

5638.639 --> 5642.159000000001
still say

5639.28 --> 5644.0
okay i get that you know but like

5642.159 --> 5646.96
assaulting somebody with a butcher

5644.0 --> 5647.44
knife to try and kill them over stealing

5646.96 --> 5650.4800000000005
a bike

5647.44 --> 5653.28
that's just insane there's no

5650.48 --> 5653.28
excuse for that

5655.52 --> 5659.120000000001
like even if he had a terrible terrible

5658.159 --> 5660.799999999999
terrible day

5659.12 --> 5664.5599999999995
a terrible week whatever there's no

5660.8 --> 5666.96
excuse for that it's just insane

5664.56 --> 5668.8
anyway i'll stop i'll stop about it you

5666.96 --> 5673.84
you just

5668.8 --> 5673.84
take care take it easy

5698.639 --> 5704.0
right well yeah

5702.0 --> 5706.08
yeah you understand how it came to be

5704.0 --> 5708.96
yeah of course

5706.08 --> 5708.96
i get it too

5710.8 --> 5715.4400000000005
but just because you understand how

5712.84 --> 5719.119000000001
something came to be doesn't really

5715.44 --> 5722.48
justify the actions right

5719.119 --> 5722.48
still him going insane

5725.6 --> 5729.360000000001
forgiveness helps me more than person

5727.679 --> 5732.88
every right

5729.36 --> 5736.5599999999995
well in that sense yeah yeah well

5732.88 --> 5740.400000000001
if if the alternative for forgiveness is

5736.56 --> 5743.119000000001
i want to get revenge back yeah

5740.4 --> 5745.04
then absolutely choose forgiveness if

5743.119 --> 5747.5199999999995
that is what it means

5745.04 --> 5749.84
right if you feel like you're if your

5747.52 --> 5752.0
ego kind of wants to lash out then

5749.84 --> 5757.84
forgiveness is going to help you more

5752.0 --> 5757.84
yes in that context i get it

5769.119 --> 5772.32
but then the forgiveness is more like

5771.199 --> 5775.28
just

5772.32 --> 5776.799999999999
the ability to let it go right is that

5775.28 --> 5778.32
really forgiving or is it just the
