is there's no trace of any kind of yeah

103.02 --> 107.44
dust trail let's just call them dust

105.61 --> 109.869
trails until you actually can prove

107.44 --> 112.65899999999999
their chemical no dust trails or

109.869 --> 116.11
anything that's just pure blue sky with

112.659 --> 118.99000000000001
a couple of clouds and some cloud still

116.11 --> 123.27
around but they're not as big as soon as

118.99 --> 129.459
then week before and yeah look like

123.27 --> 133.81
pretty intense Sun it was so warm that I

129.459 --> 136.84
actually yeah that just I did I put on a

133.81 --> 137.56
white shirt because it's Sun lead that

136.84 --> 144.73
warm again

137.56 --> 148.239
like really like surprise warmth right

144.73 --> 150.0
also this white shirt is new it's not

148.239 --> 153.70000000000002
exactly what I expected

150.0 --> 156.04
it's a well for when it has some kind of

153.7 --> 159.57
elasticity which I didn't expect and

156.04 --> 165.07
it's tight yeah I'm not used to this

159.57 --> 167.38
beard and it's a little long like like

165.07 --> 169.209
up onto my crotch and that in

167.38 --> 173.769
combination with that it's really tight

169.209 --> 175.81
makes me feel weird anyways but yeah I

173.769 --> 179.14000000000001
might return this and exchange it I

175.81 --> 182.38
don't know otherwise uh yeah maybe

179.14 --> 187.35899999999998
you'll stop being so stretchy if I wash

182.38 --> 193.18
it a couple of times whatever anyway I

187.359 --> 197.26000000000002

227.269 --> 236.76
whatever alright so welcome all Saturday

233.67 --> 239.17999999999998
edition of the early bird show so yeah

236.76 --> 249.42
lots has happened yesterday and I have a

239.18 --> 253.609
big pile of notes just take it easy for

249.42 --> 253.60899999999998
a second right

254.92 --> 260.59
debates happened after this show

257.48 --> 268.82
yesterday's show was pretty good thought

260.59 --> 271.03
hey yeah damn ikan house they got her to

268.82 --> 271.03
bed

273.36 --> 278.79
I think oh yeah a lot about the

275.699 --> 281.34000000000003
Coryell's anyway I had a part in it so

278.79 --> 287.88
we'll hear that one back on the sunday

281.34 --> 291.88899999999995
show it was a pretty good show like I

287.88 --> 294.889
was informed this time so that's good

291.889 --> 294.889
right

297.87 --> 304.32
Owen Benjamin was a very good show

302.01 --> 307.18
yesterday and the ideal life didn't

304.32 --> 308.87
glitch out as much so that was nice

307.18 --> 311.46
[Music]

308.87 --> 313.32
and he was talking about all kinds of

311.46 --> 316.60999999999996
calm the concepts especially about

313.32 --> 321.24
assault like how salt is like a

316.61 --> 323.46000000000004
electrical amplifier for the spirit and

321.24 --> 326.52
yeah how your balls collect salt so it

323.46 --> 330.06
was all about don't squirts and make

326.52 --> 334.169
making lose the salts and it was like

330.06 --> 340.61
really dug digging into that concept a

334.169 --> 340.60999999999996
lot and I kind of agree a lot anyway

342.979 --> 347.789
all right also something that I just

345.69 --> 349.919
popped into my mind it wasn't even

347.789 --> 352.289
necessarily talked about Ram it was but

349.919 --> 354.65999999999997
I made it known at least the concept of

352.289 --> 358.5
the pit and the pedestal and how like in

354.66 --> 361.5
the social setting how that is like oh

358.5 --> 364.889
yeah it's never a really good place to

361.5 --> 367.62
be yet so you gotta like try to make

364.889 --> 370.11
people not do that in order to stabilize

367.62 --> 372.81
because otherwise yeah well you could

370.11 --> 374.46000000000004
try to views it but anyway fit and the

372.81 --> 379.169
pedestal concept and it just make me

374.46 --> 382.71
think like the analogy reminds me a lot

379.169 --> 388.5
about the mushroom and the potion from

382.71 --> 391.62
Alice in Wonderland know both got her in

388.5 --> 393.81
trouble as it were especially when yeah

391.62 --> 396.599
when it was too much you know that and

393.81 --> 399.24
like the whole process in that part of

396.599 --> 401.729
the story is to make her be really

399.24 --> 403.32
careful with that stuff and I just

401.729 --> 405.139
thought you had the metaphor almost kind

403.32 --> 409.169
of reminds me of the pit in the

405.139 --> 413.569
because most of Alice in Wonderland is

409.169 --> 417.27
about social no it's about the social

413.569 --> 420.47900000000004
adulthoods confrontations in metaphor a

417.27 --> 421.10999999999996
lot of it and I thought is that what

420.479 --> 423.779
that is

421.11 --> 427.349
now of course there's the hundreds of

423.779 --> 428.839
people's over the ages over the century

427.349 --> 430.229
that have probably had their own

428.839 --> 433.969
interpretation

430.229 --> 438.419
yeah that's it's me but I thought this I

433.969 --> 450.539
thought that made sense so anyway good

438.419 --> 457.25899999999996
show of big bears and then just maybe

450.539 --> 461.219
I've watched the movie yeah I think I

457.259 --> 466.68
watched that the day before yeah I

461.219 --> 470.779
watched the the second drunken master

466.68 --> 473.52
movie in a good quality by the way and

470.779 --> 475.169
it was an extended version so I even got

473.52 --> 476.719
to see some parts that I hadn't seen

475.169 --> 479.52
before it was kind of nice

476.719 --> 484.74
yeah The Legend of the drunken master it

479.52 --> 486.959
sought so much better movie it's it's

484.74 --> 489.06
really cool and it still has kind of

486.959 --> 491.129
like the sort of traditional Chinese

489.06 --> 493.439
silliness still in it like very

491.129 --> 498.059
theatrical in how they deal with one

493.439 --> 499.11
another but as yeah there was that with

498.059 --> 501.53900000000004
the family

499.11 --> 504.529
and then there was this basically this

501.539 --> 507.27
rigid off set off kind of like yeah be

504.529 --> 509.509
the Communists the Chinese Communists

507.27 --> 515.63
and and their attitude which breaks

509.509 --> 520.319
completely with you know and and yeah

515.63 --> 524.13
that it's interesting how that works out

520.319 --> 525.75
it yeah it's it's a very big contrast

524.13 --> 530.66
with the first movie where there's none

525.75 --> 533.37
of that it's all just Chinese so yeah

530.66 --> 536.269
watching it back very interesting movie

533.37 --> 536.269
in many many ways

536.72 --> 544.48
all right watch that and then I had

539.24 --> 548.35
another for our call with Robin Stanley

544.48 --> 553.97
over Skype it always becomes four hours

548.35 --> 556.94
it reminds me of yeah no there's been

553.97 --> 559.25
more more ladies that I've had this

556.94 --> 564.2
typical thing with it yeah once you

559.25 --> 565.85
start calling he can't stop it's really

564.2 --> 570.5500000000001
good to have these long calls with Robin

565.85 --> 573.44
Stanley that's always very heartfelt and

570.55 --> 577.2199999999999
she's extremely supportive and she does

573.44 --> 579.86
understand me in a very in a deeper way

577.22 --> 583.7
that sometimes even she tells me these

579.86 --> 586.52
things that I don't have much of a grip

583.7 --> 589.46
over myself from my own perspective and

586.52 --> 591.02
she knows that an AI even kind of share

589.46 --> 594.4100000000001
it on the show just like yeah please

591.02 --> 596.42
tell me please tell me because you might

594.41 --> 598.9399999999999
be surprised that I don't see everything

596.42 --> 602.41
about myself even though I am very much

598.94 --> 611.1800000000001
onto it still things I overlooked and

602.41 --> 613.25
yeah Robin wise woman and yes it's great

611.18 --> 617.899
an hour

613.25 --> 620.24
looking forward to the next call yeah

617.899 --> 622.759
maybe we could at some point perhaps

620.24 --> 625.879
even try some kind of a show if you want

622.759 --> 628.189
you know if you feel like it not saying

625.879 --> 637.4300000000001
that I demand that or anything it's just

628.189 --> 638.99
say hey it's an option oh yeah oh God

637.43 --> 642.5889999999999
oh yeah and after that kind of before I

638.99 --> 644.6
went to bed I tuned into the arena when

642.589 --> 648.11
it wasn't gonna go on I didn't even know

644.6 --> 652.8190000000001
how to get on it was weird I couldn't

648.11 --> 655.91
find it where they were wait I couldn't

652.819 --> 656.92
actually find it but I don't know how to

655.91 --> 662.93
get in

656.92 --> 665.12
it's normally locked over at the 24/7

662.93 --> 666.8599999999999
discord it's weird how the works

665.12 --> 668.629
I don't know how they get in maybe that

666.86 --> 670.4300000000001
you have to have a special pass or

668.629 --> 674.12
something the arena pass and then you

670.43 --> 675.7399999999999
can get it I don't know but yeah that

674.12 --> 681.16
would be nice maybe to at some point

675.74 --> 684.199
also have such in thing available to me

681.16 --> 686.149
but yeah I heard chocolate Saiyans rap

684.199 --> 689.05
on there for the first time he actually

686.149 --> 689.05
recorded it

691.779 --> 694.98
that was pretty cool

700.23 --> 706.74
Oh God yeah right right good surfer yeah

705.03 --> 708.81
you sent me that little video I thought

706.74 --> 716.76
it was unexpected it was kind of funny

708.81 --> 719.3399999999999
but they were like not making it all

716.76 --> 720.99
giggly they just like think yeah it's

719.34 --> 723.84
basically I didn't know what cartoon it

720.99 --> 727.61
was I never even seen it before but yeah

723.84 --> 730.77
her man with barely any arms was

727.61 --> 732.9300000000001
apparently like a karate master just

730.77 --> 735.81
with his legs and then big fight scene

732.93 --> 739.41
like in an action movie and that was

735.81 --> 741.15
kind of silly but it's weird it kind of

739.41 --> 744.51
took at some time before I even kind of

741.15 --> 753.99
got the joke just yeah I thought it was

744.51 --> 756.45
just weird mostly a good servant but but

753.99 --> 759.09
it yeah it was kind of funny anyway

756.45 --> 761.96
yeah chuckle rock so our raps in this

759.09 --> 761.96
case Adam Aiken

767.57 --> 771.8900000000001
I a good servant yeah of course look

769.82 --> 775.4000000000001
there's many good things you could get

771.89 --> 779.8
out of it like what you're saying don't

775.4 --> 782.3
underestimate and that he's the underdog

779.8 --> 785.9
technically with this handicap but still

782.3 --> 789.68
incredibly powerful yeah that's I get it

785.9 --> 793.79
you find that very heartwarming and it

789.68 --> 795.26
is it's basically coincides with the

793.79 --> 797.39
idea of just believe in yourself

795.26 --> 802.22
whatever you're like whatever you've got

797.39 --> 803.63
and just find something and eventually

802.22 --> 806.3000000000001
it is the spirit and the wheel that

803.63 --> 808.9399999999999
determines how powerful you become not

806.3 --> 811.31
what you were born with really that's

808.94 --> 818.5600000000001
just it just determines what kind of

811.31 --> 818.56
roots you're gonna take to get there Hey

828.299 --> 837.689
yeah no I'm more weirded out by QE

833.589 --> 842.129
suddenly in his old age getting into rap

837.689 --> 842.129
now that's kind of freaking me out

846.39 --> 853.019
this is it yeah I'm not a big fan of

850.079 --> 855.899
wrath but hey if a rap happens to be

853.019 --> 858.0600000000001
very good then I will appreciate but the

855.899 --> 862.35
same kind of counts for music you know I

858.06 --> 866.9699999999999
am sensitive to music I like really good

862.35 --> 870.149
music I don't like it all the time but

866.97 --> 872.149
has its place but at the same time music

870.149 --> 876.06
that's kind of lame or as mainstream

872.149 --> 880.14
bland and an inspired corporate I hate

876.06 --> 882.149
it so yeah and I guess the same goes in

880.14 --> 884.79
general for a rap and hip-hop and they

882.149 --> 888.0
yeah they they trashed it up so much in

884.79 --> 893.01
the mainstream it's dead yeah that kind

888.0 --> 901.62
of just killed it off for me probably

893.01 --> 903.87
not alone I'm not alone you added what

901.62 --> 906.38
up see that way point story with the

903.87 --> 909.36
cabinets costing like 20 grand peeps

906.38 --> 917.61
seeing their traffic kits and Waypoint

909.36 --> 919.17
and now yeah I don't know he's a I take

917.61 --> 921.48
it you're talking about the United

919.17 --> 926.13
States sheesh

921.48 --> 927.51
oh there's a like some really crazy [ __ ]

926.13 --> 932.75
about to unfold

927.51 --> 936.5699999999999
have you seen yeah and still keep tabs

932.75 --> 938.31
but there was like a really part an

936.57 --> 943.9490000000001
article that just like hit me in the

938.31 --> 945.8389999999999
face from natural news from Mike Adams

943.949 --> 950.0999999999999
you know who's been all fear poorni

945.839 --> 954.1400000000001
considering Corona but now he yeah he

950.1 --> 957.66
turned his face and said they got really

954.14 --> 961.8
really fanatical in a way and it's

957.66 --> 963.99
almost like yeah that very very very

961.8 --> 968.01
angry part inside of me suddenly like

963.99 --> 975.0600000000001
yeh and the not so very very angry part

968.01 --> 977.52
of me it's like oh so yeah but he is

975.06 --> 979.279
basically putting it down and it kind of

977.52 --> 982.009
reminded so maybe this [ __ ] is

979.279 --> 984.529
about to unfold maybe it's coming people

982.009 --> 985.839
are pushing it forward because it is

984.529 --> 990.8
about to happen

985.839 --> 993.009
it could be man wouldn't that be

990.8 --> 993.0089999999999
something

1003.9 --> 1008.5699999999999
anyway yeah think of this article what

1006.21 --> 1008.57
you will

1015.08 --> 1023.6500000000001
hmm but yet that stood out to me when I

1020.72 --> 1023.65
bumped into that

1029.0 --> 1034.13
he just ran a story with the Governor of

1031.46 --> 1038.96
California taking money from China

1034.13 --> 1043.25
oh yeah no [ __ ] but that's been pretty

1038.96 --> 1045.41
upfront for a while how California kind

1043.25 --> 1049.55
of seems to have been corporately bought

1045.41 --> 1053.0600000000002
out by China in many ways for for some

1049.55 --> 1055.75
time now and yeah there's been many

1053.06 --> 1063.07
conspiracy talks about it many many many

1055.75 --> 1065.78
for years especially from like yeah

1063.07 --> 1069.8899999999999
conspiracy theories or yeah just woken

1065.78 --> 1077.06
up people in California dead are not

1069.89 --> 1080.72
very happy about that of course so yeah

1077.06 --> 1082.37
and indeed I bet you I bet you that 90%

1080.72 --> 1086.75
of everything that's happened just slips

1082.37 --> 1089.2299999999998
away it's just because of at some point

1086.75 --> 1092.78
you know when things get really crazy

1089.23 --> 1095.66
then the reporter is just gonna stay

1092.78 --> 1098.51
away because it's too much and once you

1095.66 --> 1101.44
get in you get in so deep that yeah it's

1098.51 --> 1105.89
just nobody's prepared for that

1101.44 --> 1110.17
maybe so yeah most of it just gets lost

1105.89 --> 1110.17
cuz nobody takes it on it's too much

1115.78 --> 1126.01
what does that sir see RFK JR knows that

1121.51 --> 1129.37
was asking it like chat audience touch

1126.01 --> 1132.01
his nose like an overtly touches his

1129.37 --> 1137.6689999999999
nose looking at the chat pretty well who

1132.01 --> 1137.669
knows what who are you talking about

1157.54 --> 1163.74
I have no idea who you're talking about

1159.79 --> 1163.74
Lisa malsky who is that

1171.37 --> 1176.25
okay was he supposed to be dead

1176.45 --> 1180.44
was he like the second guy that got

1178.64 --> 1183.3500000000001
killed in the can in the family as it

1180.44 --> 1185.77
were and he are is that the one you're

1183.35 --> 1185.77
talking about

1199.53 --> 1208.02
oh you know what there's even ideas

1203.36 --> 1212.82
conspiracy ideas that JFK himself might

1208.02 --> 1215.6399999999999
actually still be alive that it was all

1212.82 --> 1218.22
of Mark setup like it was a like a

1215.64 --> 1221.13
president that was kind of like a terror

1218.22 --> 1222.96
tactic from the CIA to basically

1221.13 --> 1224.4
convince everyone that they had so much

1222.96 --> 1225.81
control that they could take out of the

1224.4 --> 1227.6100000000001
president but they were not actually

1225.81 --> 1231.21
able to do it so they just put up a

1227.61 --> 1236.75
giant megacrisis act with that and kind

1231.21 --> 1236.75
of smuggle them out and blew up a dummy

1242.74 --> 1250.83
you know I've heard about that one so or

1246.31 --> 1253.84
you if you say so

1250.83 --> 1257.29
what's the some of you killed possible

1253.84 --> 1259.53
Clinton harelips ok well that's way out

1257.29 --> 1259.53
of my league

1272.37 --> 1275.4799999999998
[Music]

1277.7 --> 1287.1390000000001
a many young

1314.429 --> 1319.039
don't you say hello to Martin tall mercs

1319.369 --> 1322.85
welcome to the show

1331.87 --> 1342.4599999999998
anyway oh yeah this morning I still had

1340.21 --> 1343.72
something else on list because I didn't

1342.46 --> 1344.169
make notes for what I do in the morning

1343.72 --> 1347.1000000000001
as well

1344.169 --> 1349.69
because hey I get up early a lot so I

1347.1 --> 1351.6999999999998
was some iron real media because the I

1349.69 --> 1354.159
watched the first part yesterday with

1351.7 --> 1356.65
Martin lidka in the morning apparently

1354.159 --> 1360.21
did come back on in the evening but I

1356.65 --> 1366.159
couldn't watch it was just five hours

1360.21 --> 1368.2
you know it's too much but yeah her flip

1366.159 --> 1370.69
to a part where he wasn't getting on and

1368.2 --> 1374.38
it was kind of same as the yeah that

1370.69 --> 1375.76
morning does more of that so that was

1374.38 --> 1378.6100000000001
pretty good but I didn't catch it all

1375.76 --> 1381.9089999999999
and yeah watch this perky's first him

1378.61 --> 1383.4699999999998
wife subscribed and bailed him I hit the

1381.909 --> 1386.5590000000002
bell notification it's Persky before

1383.47 --> 1387.22
some well and he's doing like this thing

1386.559 --> 1390.51
now

1387.22 --> 1395.77
I was basically challenging ballers and

1390.51 --> 1398.08
I got a name for him because yeah the

1395.77 --> 1400.6589999999999
amount of ballers that are in that and

1398.08 --> 1404.07
the way it's presented like discord

1400.659 --> 1411.0
square just a box with all the icons

1404.07 --> 1414.25
it's really this first chemo ball pit so

1411.0 --> 1422.26
yes for schema I got a name for you it's

1414.25 --> 1426.88
the ball pit get it like those things

1422.26 --> 1429.52
you have certain places like a big bath

1426.88 --> 1432.429
full filled with balls it's a ball pit

1429.52 --> 1435.52
that that's what what your thing is what

1432.429 --> 1437.23
you're doing a room filled up with the

1435.52 --> 1440.59
giant amount of dollars and you're just

1437.23 --> 1443.32
in there basically letting the balls all

1440.59 --> 1448.149
bounce around and just I don't know how

1443.32 --> 1449.799
you do it man the bottomless pit now

1448.149 --> 1453.07
come on and why do you have to make it

1449.799 --> 1455.73
so dark come on it's a good joke right

1453.07 --> 1455.73
the ball pits

1461.04 --> 1465.81
if you think about it it really does

1463.44 --> 1469.65
seem like he's just standing in a ball

1465.81 --> 1474.56
pit and just being Spurs kemo in between

1469.65 --> 1474.5600000000002
a pit of balls just screwing around and

1475.28 --> 1482.6399999999999
he is kind of he does really take

1479.7 --> 1487.53
control in a way like I don't know how

1482.64 --> 1489.75
he does it it's weird but even as like

1487.53 --> 1499.29
I'm Scott feech in there and all that so

1489.75 --> 1503.55
it's pretty astounding a ball pool is

1499.29 --> 1505.8
that what they call that okay I'll call

1503.55 --> 1507.6599999999999
it the ball pool and if that is a the

1505.8 --> 1511.73
more proper English way to describe it

1507.66 --> 1511.73
because that is what I what I meant

1513.17 --> 1517.64
that is called a ball pit I don't know

1527.01 --> 1531.99
does he now mr. blink it

1540.91 --> 1546.64
oh really MacGyver instead of Nemea

1543.37 --> 1549.6399999999999
technology the yaksa moon footage I

1546.64 --> 1552.15
don't even know what that is is that a

1549.64 --> 1552.15
recent thing

1569.67 --> 1575.28
japanese moon orbiter okay

1588.319 --> 1594.809
spaceforce needs to recognize she what

1592.369 --> 1598.789
are you saying there's gonna be like a

1594.809 --> 1601.519
space like a fake space Wars basically

1598.789 --> 1612.299
where they're going to fake fight it off

1601.519 --> 1615.44
like I don't know extra planetary WWF is

1612.299 --> 1615.44
that would you predict ISA

1633.26 --> 1636.76
to get rid of NASA

1647.299 --> 1653.899
like a replacement to make them full

1651.399 --> 1656.629
basically take the fall for having faked

1653.899 --> 1658.369
the moon landing and then ya say okay

1656.629 --> 1667.009
but we're going to do it better is that

1658.369 --> 1669.379
what you're saying so they're gonna they

1667.009 --> 1674.799
gonna try to use those lights to destroy

1669.379 --> 1674.799
what all right

1676.43 --> 1681.47
yeah yeah Robin Stanton that's what I

1678.95 --> 1684.3500000000001
thought I was thinking that the whole

1681.47 --> 1689.2
space first set up it's really just a

1684.35 --> 1692.6599999999999
cover story it's all secret surface

1689.2 --> 1694.64
investments and just yeah intelligence

1692.66 --> 1696.5600000000002
operations I think it's the whole thing

1694.64 --> 1703.5500000000002
is to cover for an intelligence

1696.56 --> 1706.6699999999998
operation quite literally and who knows

1703.55 --> 1708.29
maybe there will be some soldiers or

1706.67 --> 1711.3500000000001
whatever that are going to have like

1708.29 --> 1713.81
astronaut training or something but I

1711.35 --> 1715.81
bet that the vast majority it is just

1713.81 --> 1718.22
instantly put to work as a

1715.81 --> 1720.26
counterintelligence operation just to

1718.22 --> 1729.41
try to get some control over the

1720.26 --> 1731.62
situation what do you think ISA you want

1729.41 --> 1734.0
to come on the show talk about it

1731.62 --> 1736.31
screw it I'm just gonna call you up on

1734.0 --> 1739.24
skype you're gonna come on the show

1736.31 --> 1739.24
whether you like it or not

1746.41 --> 1751.26
just gonna find you though oh yeah

1756.63 --> 1760.0400000000002
yeah there you go

1763.3 --> 1770.859
[Music]

1772.3 --> 1784.24
yeah hello Zack can you hear me yeah why

1781.4 --> 1787.0
what good morning

1784.24 --> 1791.57
border but let me get my headphones on

1787.0 --> 1794.08
all right yeah yeah no you you seem to

1791.57 --> 1798.02
be very informed about the space force

1794.08 --> 1800.51
situation and I thought maybe it'd be

1798.02 --> 1803.12
good to get you on my show and talk

1800.51 --> 1804.86
about it a little bit more instead of

1803.12 --> 1807.6499999999999
just mecca for thing and chat about it

1804.86 --> 1809.6299999999999
for half an hour I don't know well you

1807.65 --> 1811.43
know it's got me thinking it's like see

1809.63 --> 1813.7700000000002
like let me see if you can hear me after

1811.43 --> 1815.8700000000001
I put these headphones good it's just

1813.77 --> 1818.92
one two you can hear me yeah we can hear

1815.87 --> 1821.4499999999998
you all right cool

1818.92 --> 1822.95
so yeah so I think what they did was

1821.45 --> 1825.5900000000001
they tried to fit you know they faked

1822.95 --> 1827.81
the moon landing all right in order in

1825.59 --> 1830.33
order so they could come back you know

1827.81 --> 1832.61
however many years later and point out

1830.33 --> 1837.9499999999998
that they faked them on landing and then

1832.61 --> 1842.4799999999998
try to destroy America with that with

1837.95 --> 1845.99
that expose right so I think what it is

1842.48 --> 1849.26
that you know I like space floors and

1845.99 --> 1854.33
stuff has been put in play too you know

1849.26 --> 1857.21
to take over what NASA has done and I

1854.33 --> 1860.24
think I know even like to take like the

1857.21 --> 1861.65
rains right like right like even like

1860.24 --> 1863.21
potentially like you know this is what

1861.65 --> 1865.6100000000001
makes me think like reason a lot of

1863.21 --> 1867.23
people or a lot of you know I don't know

1865.61 --> 1871.37
people may have been fighting Flat Earth

1867.23 --> 1874.58
is that Flat Earth is like almost a way

1871.37 --> 1877.9399999999998
for these bastards to try and destroy

1874.58 --> 1879.07
our country and might well my country

1877.94 --> 1883.22
[Applause]

1879.07 --> 1886.85
you know bikes by trying to expose their

1883.22 --> 1888.47
own lies and in doing so they're gonna

1886.85 --> 1892.07
try to throw the baby out with the

1888.47 --> 1893.749
bathwater right and and so you know I

1892.07 --> 1895.98
don't think

1893.749 --> 1899.94
you know I think there's an active

1895.98 --> 1902.22
there's you know an active attempt to

1899.94 --> 1904.23
destroy that by you know creating space

1902.22 --> 1905.58
force and by you know cuz you got to

1904.23 --> 1907.8600000000001
think like you know a lot of us like

1905.58 --> 1909.71
we've come to the point where you know

1907.86 --> 1911.789
we may believe we're on you know

1909.71 --> 1915.6290000000001
something different than most people

1911.789 --> 1918.749
believe but but the reality is 98% of

1915.629 --> 1921.269
the people like they need space we've

1918.749 --> 1923.19
talked about this like they psychologic

1921.269 --> 1926.46
like think about like this the moon

1923.19 --> 1929.22
landing for the baby boomers was like a

1926.46 --> 1931.799
like it's like trying to think of a way

1929.22 --> 1934.98
to put it it's like us a psychological

1931.799 --> 1937.32
necessity like for them like they

1934.98 --> 1938.909
position you know and for for anyone to

1937.32 --> 1942.259
come along and break somebody's

1938.909 --> 1945.69
psychological position it's cruel

1942.259 --> 1948.299
right great so like you know regardless

1945.69 --> 1950.72
of our beliefs and what you know some of

1948.299 --> 1953.85
these things are what we disagree about

1950.72 --> 1956.609
you know a lot of people still need to

1953.85 --> 1958.529
have a space force because they've got

1956.609 --> 1965.789
to be protected from you know the

1958.529 --> 1967.619
[ __ ] draconian makes right they need

1965.789 --> 1971.609
that whole [ __ ] show in order to

1967.619 --> 1974.879
psychologically manage themselves you

1971.609 --> 1978.71
know to keep control anyway by the way I

1974.879 --> 1980.82
need to shout out Amanda you for the $20

1978.71 --> 1984.779
PayPal donation thank you very much

1980.82 --> 1989.549
Amanda you're a champ and yeah let's

1984.779 --> 1992.22
continue you're totally right I it's

1989.549 --> 1993.239
kind of in an indirect way kind of the

1992.22 --> 1996.6000000000001
shown

1993.239 --> 1998.609
shined through earlier even just with

1996.6 --> 2000.83
talks with people like Patricia and Mark

1998.609 --> 2002.33
Sargent because of course people have

2000.83 --> 2004.82
been considering this that there is like

2002.33 --> 2006.9189999999999
a political struggle going on the

2004.82 --> 2009.35
exploration data and the moon landing is

2006.919 --> 2012.5590000000002
about to go like it's literally about to

2009.35 --> 2015.889
spoil and yeah the consequences will

2012.559 --> 2018.23
have impact well I think about hope kind

2015.889 --> 2020.4189999999999
of is we're looking forward to use that

2018.23 --> 2022.46
indeed to take the whole thing down to

2020.419 --> 2024.7990000000002
take down America with the shame of the

2022.46 --> 2026.02
moment as it were and just push it and

2024.799 --> 2028.77
kill it

2026.02 --> 2034.62
and that group that doesn't want that

2028.77 --> 2038.62
their solution is to kind of replace it

2034.62 --> 2041.3799999999999
in a mottled way and then prevent the

2038.62 --> 2042.9599999999998
Dark One's from abusing the situation to

2041.38 --> 2046.63
kill it off the whole thing

2042.96 --> 2048.28
so yeah that's space for us yeah and I

2046.63 --> 2051.1
think you know it's like it's you know

2048.28 --> 2055.3900000000003
it's a necessary thing you know because

2051.1 --> 2058.14
like you know I just think people are

2055.39 --> 2060.2799999999997
far more sensitive than we recognize and

2058.14 --> 2062.62
and I think like you know they're gonna

2060.28 --> 2064.409
like let's say for the conspiracy

2062.62 --> 2066.94
theorists out there that's gonna say oh

2064.409 --> 2069.4900000000002
well you know we need to tell everybody

2066.94 --> 2072.78
the truth and you know and space forces

2069.49 --> 2075.22
a lie and like you know and all that

2072.78 --> 2078.7000000000003
it's like you know look they're you know

2075.22 --> 2081.149
more people than our little minority

2078.7 --> 2084.1589999999997
really believe this [ __ ]

2081.149 --> 2085.87
so therefore you have to have an answer

2084.159 --> 2088.87
for those people and in the political

2085.87 --> 2092.14
game you're playing towards the masses

2088.87 --> 2093.94
not like you know the fringe but the but

2092.14 --> 2096.46
the masses have to have access

2093.94 --> 2098.4700000000003
choose the fringe ideas that's why I'm

2096.46 --> 2102.25
you know that's why so many countries

2098.47 --> 2104.89
are built upon the premise of the United

2102.25 --> 2106.54
States model because it allows for

2104.89 --> 2109.6
freedom of thought you know a lot of a

2106.54 --> 2112.7799999999997
lot of countries constitutions have

2109.6 --> 2114.1
adopted the American approach and the

2112.78 --> 2116.59
reet and the reason they did that is

2114.1 --> 2121.54
because the masses have to be allowed to

2116.59 --> 2123.94
hear the fringe message and if anyone's

2121.54 --> 2126.16
gonna try to burn down this system that

2123.94 --> 2126.84
we have now you know you're a [ __ ]

2126.16 --> 2130.1499999999996
idiot

2126.84 --> 2134.53
yeah because because this is the one

2130.15 --> 2137.26
system that allows for you to exist you

2134.53 --> 2142.75
know in total opposition to mainstream

2137.26 --> 2145.3900000000003
society like you know and also why did

2142.75 --> 2147.42
it like the Dark One's are making it so

2145.39 --> 2151.06
incredibly dirty they're constantly

2147.42 --> 2153.19
trying to break free speech and like

2151.06 --> 2157.21
even programming other people to do that

2153.19 --> 2159.91
and incentivizing breaking get making it

2157.21 --> 2161.829
so crazy that at some point people

2159.91 --> 2164.3799999999997
we'll just not know what else to do

2161.829 --> 2168.2200000000003
except cancel free speech because it has

2164.38 --> 2170.5
grown out of control too much I mean

2168.22 --> 2173.859
what did I see what I mean like oh yeah

2170.5 --> 2178.38
what are you against that how do you

2173.859 --> 2180.7889999999998
retain free speech yet control it better

2178.38 --> 2183.819
well I mean I mean I don't know it's a

2180.789 --> 2185.7990000000004
complicated question but I think but I

2183.819 --> 2187.7799999999997
think like I think one of the ways to do

2185.799 --> 2190.27
it is exactly like we are like we have

2187.78 --> 2194.38
done it in the sense that like you know

2190.27 --> 2197.41
it's a it's a very American thing to say

2194.38 --> 2199.7200000000003
I disagree with you but I will fight to

2197.41 --> 2201.64
the death for your right to be able to

2199.72 --> 2203.859
say it right right right

2201.64 --> 2205.45
yeah and and and that's the thing like

2203.859 --> 2208.9
especially like in the slider it's like

2205.45 --> 2212.049
you know you know like I like you you

2208.9 --> 2214.0
could only be a flat earther because you

2212.049 --> 2217.089
live in a system that allows you to

2214.0 --> 2218.38
disagree with society like if you tried

2217.089 --> 2220.119
that [ __ ] in China

2218.38 --> 2223.44
they'd probably arrest you for going

2220.119 --> 2227.38
against the Chinese [ __ ] military

2223.44 --> 2229.4500000000003
yeah you know I mean so like you know

2227.38 --> 2231.579
for all like you know I think we need to

2229.45 --> 2234.0099999999998
recognize how awesome we have it and

2231.579 --> 2237.099
stop being such privileged little

2234.01 --> 2239.349
limp-wristed [ __ ] losers and [ __ ]

2237.099 --> 2241.2400000000002
deal with like you know the fact that a

2239.349 --> 2243.25
lot of people disagree with let's say

2241.24 --> 2245.7889999999998
our position on the Flat Earth but we

2243.25 --> 2250.18
still have to if we want to be you know

2245.789 --> 2253.69
allowed to exist in this time we do have

2250.18 --> 2256.45
to also you know exercise real tolerance

2253.69 --> 2257.859
and show the way forward and I think

2256.45 --> 2260.2599999999998
that is how we're good that's how we

2257.859 --> 2262.69
already won Flat Earth all right we won

2260.26 --> 2262.9300000000003
this we won this battle [ __ ] years

2262.69 --> 2265.029
ago

2262.93 --> 2267.6699999999996
right but what is it what is a sensible

2265.029 --> 2270.19
approach for for tolerance as a method

2267.67 --> 2272.079
you know because if you just take the

2270.19 --> 2273.01
word literally then tolerance could be

2272.079 --> 2275.5890000000004
anything you know

2273.01 --> 2277.3900000000003
well no it's about debate at Manor I

2275.589 --> 2279.13
mean you have to have a manner an ethics

2277.39 --> 2281.02
you know and I think those are the kinds

2279.13 --> 2282.88
of things that come into play it's like

2281.02 --> 2285.46
hold on I was gonna make a point I think

2282.88 --> 2287.77
that tolerance that when you have that

2285.46 --> 2289.599
in mind you should apply a certain

2287.77 --> 2293.47
method to it and that is you should only

2289.599 --> 2295.9
tolerate that which

2293.47 --> 2298.6899999999996
if somebody is for example having bad

2295.9 --> 2300.55
behavior then like why where will they

2298.69 --> 2303.099
go what do you know of them are they

2300.55 --> 2305.71
going to learn of this and if you think

2303.099 --> 2307.3590000000004
they will then you should probably

2305.71 --> 2309.43
tolerate it because it's a learning

2307.359 --> 2310.96
process right we all experience this

2309.43 --> 2313.5099999999998
even in our Flat Earth debates and all

2310.96 --> 2316.18
that it's like yeah certain things you

2313.51 --> 2318.4300000000003
sure tolerate it because you're certain

2316.18 --> 2320.29
that they will probably probably already

2318.43 --> 2322.27
know it there are gonna learn from it

2320.29 --> 2323.98
over time because they want to now on

2322.27 --> 2325.869
the other hand if somebody has certain

2323.98 --> 2328.27
types of behavior and they're actually

2325.869 --> 2330.4900000000002
looking a way to normalize it and

2328.27 --> 2332.71
stretch it open even further that's what

2330.49 --> 2336.6699999999996
the DeMarcus is do that's what demons do

2332.71 --> 2339.76
that should never be tolerated but based

2336.67 --> 2341.6800000000003
on how the thing is being done is

2339.76 --> 2343.8100000000004
somebody actually tried to make things

2341.68 --> 2347.0499999999997
worse or are they just expressing and

2343.81 --> 2350.0789999999997
anything that they will resolve that's

2347.05 --> 2353.26
very important in my opinion as to what

2350.079 --> 2356.5890000000004
should be a standard guideline for the

2353.26 --> 2372.5200000000004
concept of Tolerance in general what do

2356.589 --> 2376.66
you say okay well tolerance how and when

2372.52 --> 2378.599
and it's about intuition for me it's

2376.66 --> 2383.0789999999997
like okay if somebody is having

2378.599 --> 2385.3590000000004
misbehavior or whatever it is yeah how

2383.079 --> 2388.3900000000003
are they doing it what is it gonna lead

2385.359 --> 2389.44
to you need to understand somebody you

2388.39 --> 2391.42
need to understand where they're coming

2389.44 --> 2393.31
from or yeah you might just hit

2391.42 --> 2394.9900000000002
completely to the point or hurt them

2393.31 --> 2398.17
knowingly or whatever you know you need

2394.99 --> 2400.3289999999997
to know people when you're going to go

2398.17 --> 2401.29
into a real serious conversation with

2400.329 --> 2403.9
them or you don't know what you're

2401.29 --> 2406.17
getting get yourself into so if

2403.9 --> 2410.14
somebody's in your view makes a mistake

2406.17 --> 2414.31
then yeah you should tolerate it if you

2410.14 --> 2417.819
think that yeah that it is part of a

2414.31 --> 2420.2799999999997
process of them just learning that they

2417.819 --> 2422.14
will probably figure it out you know

2420.28 --> 2424.48
that it was a mistake and then try to

2422.14 --> 2427.2999999999997
grow from it as normal people should be

2424.48 --> 2429.16
doing but if somebody makes

2427.3 --> 2432.6400000000003
same mistake but from a different type

2429.16 --> 2434.77
of attitude and actually is trying to

2432.64 --> 2438.64
work to normalize that mistake in

2434.77 --> 2441.46
basically opening the big gates rights

2438.64 --> 2443.74
damaging logos eroding logos further in

2441.46 --> 2445.3
the process that they're actually going

2443.74 --> 2447.04
to double down on the mistake even s

2445.3 --> 2448.6600000000003
there make making it and you can see

2447.04 --> 2451.24
that you can feel that from people when

2448.66 --> 2454.2999999999997
they are like that then it should never

2451.24 --> 2456.3999999999996
be tolerated right well I think you know

2454.3 --> 2459.61
the how did I get through her at this

2456.4 --> 2461.62
time yes I think so because I think but

2459.61 --> 2464.4100000000003
I think though those people are like a

2461.62 --> 2466.99
fringe you know they mean like really

2464.41 --> 2468.6099999999997
bad well those are like Marxist

2466.99 --> 2471.0699999999997
surrender those are people guided by

2468.61 --> 2473.4700000000003
demons basically that's I mean right and

2471.07 --> 2475.9900000000002
I've already usually only people that

2473.47 --> 2479.4399999999996
have in some serious serious person we

2475.99 --> 2483.5499999999997
have given themselves up can even do

2479.44 --> 2485.9500000000003
that because yeah if you're natural you

2483.55 --> 2488.8900000000003
will have effects they'll stop you from

2485.95 --> 2490.5699999999997
doing it because it hurts right but I

2488.89 --> 2492.96
think with information and this is why

2490.57 --> 2496.27
the debate and the access to the to the

2492.96 --> 2499.48
alternate viewpoint is so important is

2496.27 --> 2503.29
because with knowledge you can then you

2499.48 --> 2505.42
know you can correct your your position

2503.29 --> 2507.61
or your or you have the opportunity to

2505.42 --> 2509.02
correct your position and you know and

2507.61 --> 2510.7000000000003
that's how you can tell the difference

2509.02 --> 2511.9
is that these people I mean take like

2510.7 --> 2515.14
you know when we first came out here

2511.9 --> 2517.6600000000003
like you know I'm so proud of what we've

2515.14 --> 2520.93
done even on the Flat Earth because when

2517.66 --> 2523.83
I first came out flattered this is just

2520.93 --> 2527.2
the baseline whatever else man

2523.83 --> 2530.37
spiritually societal psychology figuring

2527.2 --> 2532.99
out the law figuring of us like

2530.37 --> 2537.27
dimensional things the spirit realm

2532.99 --> 2539.5
figuring out really detailed like

2537.27 --> 2541.57
instead of going because I've been down

2539.5 --> 2543.52
the rabbit oh well just the point being

2541.57 --> 2545.8
this is that look when we first came out

2543.52 --> 2547.27
here you know there was two sides of

2545.8 --> 2548.8300000000004
this there was like you know really like

2547.27 --> 2550.48
the flatter side that was saying hey

2548.83 --> 2553.09
look you know we got some questions

2550.48 --> 2554.62
about what's going on with gravity and

2553.09 --> 2557.17
contained you know whatever the issue

2554.62 --> 2559.06
may have been right and and there was

2557.17 --> 2559.89
another group of people that said know

2559.06 --> 2561.96
what it is you

2559.89 --> 2565.68
don't understand and you have to be

2561.96 --> 2570.21
scared off the internet mm-hmm so as

2565.68 --> 2572.339
soon as they did that they lost because

2570.21 --> 2577.289
most people understood that that's the

2572.339 --> 2579.089
tactics of [ __ ] losers so when they

2577.289 --> 2580.92
did that they lost and in the same

2579.089 --> 2582.48
approach now and what we're seeing I

2580.92 --> 2584.339
think in the political realm is the same

2582.48 --> 2586.5
thing you're getting like you know right

2584.339 --> 2589.5
now it's like the conservative movement

2586.5 --> 2591.869
of the world is being told to shut the

2589.5 --> 2594.359
[ __ ] up and being scared offline while

2591.869 --> 2596.1600000000003
these knuckleheads are supported by tech

2594.359 --> 2598.799
companies and ever I mean look at it

2596.16 --> 2601.769
like all the ballers online are defended

2598.799 --> 2604.92
by YouTube the YouTube heroes the

2601.769 --> 2607.2889999999998
algorithms the Jay Trigg the [ __ ]

2604.92 --> 2609.75
whole show and that's how you know

2607.289 --> 2612.42
they're losers because they need all

2609.75 --> 2614.01
that for their [ __ ] argument and and

2612.42 --> 2615.809
that's how you know that they're gonna

2614.01 --> 2618.9
ultimately in my opinion you know

2615.809 --> 2621.119
mankind will overcome these people you

2618.9 --> 2622.289
know and I and it's like you know I

2621.119 --> 2624.63
think that's not so interesting right

2622.289 --> 2626.4900000000002
now is we're watching it you know I

2624.63 --> 2628.17
would hope we're watching it happen like

2626.49 --> 2629.97
you know they're being destroyed and

2628.17 --> 2632.039
part of like you know take like those

2629.97 --> 2633.8999999999996
groups like correct the record that the

2632.039 --> 2636.0
clintons and all them founded you know

2633.9 --> 2638.9100000000003
Jeffrey Epstein had that one scientist

2636.0 --> 2642.119
on the island what's his name Lawrence

2638.91 --> 2644.67
Krauss and then Lawrence and then

2642.119 --> 2647.119
Lawrence Lawrence Krauss was on the

2644.67 --> 2652.799
remember that old show or the that show

2647.119 --> 2658.38
the non sequitur you know how did they

2652.799 --> 2659.7
get Lawrence Krauss on and why you know

2658.38 --> 2662.819
what I mean and why have these people

2659.7 --> 2664.14
been attacking us online like you know

2662.819 --> 2665.7
and then think of it we got [ __ ]

2664.14 --> 2669.3289999999997
what's-his-name the guy who had that

2665.7 --> 2672.089
website with Tony Hawk and [ __ ] Mick

2669.329 --> 2673.5890000000004
West hmm like you know I mean why are

2672.089 --> 2675.569
they coming out here trying to tell us

2673.589 --> 2677.3089999999997
all to get off line and shut the [ __ ] up

2675.569 --> 2678.99
and maybe not make West so much because

2677.309 --> 2681.2400000000002
at least he comes out in debate and

2678.99 --> 2683.8489999999997
debates but you know I mean like like

2681.24 --> 2685.9199999999996
what's the connection there so in that

2683.849 --> 2690.7400000000002
regard I look at it like oh space force

2685.92 --> 2693.609
is to kick these losers off the table so

2690.74 --> 2697.1189999999997
my opinion and then

2693.609 --> 2700.48
do it then because it with the same

2697.119 --> 2703.2690000000002
issues you know how about this it won't

2700.48 --> 2705.249
be like in the public eye it won't be

2703.269 --> 2706.749
like haha we're getting rid of NASA to

2705.249 --> 2708.64
put in space force because NASA's

2706.749 --> 2712.029
whatever now it's just going to be a

2708.64 --> 2714.339
transference a quiet transference of

2712.029 --> 2717.999
power and these people will be shuffled

2714.339 --> 2719.529
off that's what I think I mean I mean

2717.999 --> 2721.839
and maybe I'm wrong I'd really don't

2719.529 --> 2724.839
know but like I gotta you might just be

2721.839 --> 2726.0389999999998
on to something there all right but I

2724.839 --> 2729.4
gotta say there's like you know a

2726.039 --> 2731.529
scientific technocracy that we've been

2729.4 --> 2735.64
all you know kind of warning about for

2731.529 --> 2737.349
[ __ ] you know 20 years and and now

2735.64 --> 2739.39
we're seeing them you know we're seeing

2737.349 --> 2741.73
them they're almost like preemptively

2739.39 --> 2743.65
making their move and it's like you know

2741.73 --> 2745.9
they shot their load too early and now

2743.65 --> 2747.94
they're gonna get [ __ ] wrecked yeah

2745.9 --> 2754.89
please tone down on the f-bombs by the

2747.94 --> 2758.2000000000003
way but yeah

2754.89 --> 2763.8689999999997
well they shut but what did they even do

2758.2 --> 2765.759
you know in all this time yeah when you

2763.869 --> 2768.5190000000002
look at the connections between Disney

2765.759 --> 2770.829
they did choose tinkering work like

2768.519 --> 2773.6189999999997
detail work like oh they got a sort of a

2770.829 --> 2777.88
camera program with the eyes it's like

2773.619 --> 2781.2690000000002
all minor work no big projects at all in

2777.88 --> 2783.4
all that time like the bigger project

2781.269 --> 2784.6299999999997
seems to be going to like SpaceX and all

2783.4 --> 2787.69
that but yeah look at what they're doing

2784.63 --> 2790.779
it's kind of almost the same well now

2787.69 --> 2793.18
remember Iran musk is so [ __ ] cool he

2790.779 --> 2796.059
came out and he's like you know you know

2793.18 --> 2798.43
it's real because it was like you know

2796.059 --> 2800.739
like dudes like only the idiot ballers

2798.43 --> 2803.739
out here that really like you know the

2800.739 --> 2805.21
people that cannot think laterally you

2803.739 --> 2808.029
know I mean like they are that they need

2805.21 --> 2808.989
this type of [ __ ] like it's like you

2808.029 --> 2810.069
know I was talking to a friend of mine

2808.989 --> 2812.71
the other day it's like if you meet

2810.069 --> 2814.39
somebody and they're like you know like

2812.71 --> 2815.799
just you know there's two types of

2814.39 --> 2817.509
people like let's say you're tracking in

2815.799 --> 2819.609
the woods or you're in the woods and you

2817.509 --> 2821.589
see some deer track and then you're like

2819.609 --> 2823.5389999999998
oh shoot there's gonna be a deer up here

2821.589 --> 2824.769
and you're with a friend and you're

2823.539 --> 2827.32
walking through the woods and sure

2824.769 --> 2830.08
enough you come across to a deer

2827.32 --> 2831.67
you know if you try to explain you know

2830.08 --> 2834.46
you could you could explain to them hey

2831.67 --> 2837.28
I saw these tracks and then it made me

2834.46 --> 2839.11
consider the possibility that there was

2837.28 --> 2841.1200000000003
going to be a deer up here and they're

2839.11 --> 2843.58
like nah because they didn't see the

2841.12 --> 2845.0499999999997
tracks and then you know you see you

2843.58 --> 2847.33
know at certain people you might as well

2845.05 --> 2851.7400000000002
tell them well what it really is is I'm

2847.33 --> 2854.38
a shaman and I can speak to fairies and

2851.74 --> 2856.8399999999997
so and so they told me that there was

2854.38 --> 2858.73
gonna be a deer up there and that's

2856.84 --> 2860.4700000000003
there's literally half the population

2858.73 --> 2863.43
would rather believe that you're a

2860.47 --> 2866.3799999999997
shaman that can talk to fairies fairies

2863.43 --> 2871.06
instead of look and actually discern

2866.38 --> 2872.05
what a deer track is and so I think like

2871.06 --> 2874.06
you know that's what we're dealing with

2872.05 --> 2875.59
and that's where you know Elon Musk just

2874.06 --> 2877.72
gave them all the flatters there's a

2875.59 --> 2879.31
wink and a nod but he said that and he

2877.72 --> 2882.04
said you know and he looked down on

2879.31 --> 2883.7799999999997
anyone that believed it that's what I

2882.04 --> 2886.06
think and I think if we don't read

2883.78 --> 2889.48
through the lines we're just as stupid

2886.06 --> 2891.1
as they are we don't redo the lines what

2889.48 --> 2893.29
do you mean well well I'm seeing like

2891.1 --> 2895.75
you know if anyone out there that's like

2893.29 --> 2898.87
a flat earther that's mad at Elon Musk

2895.75 --> 2902.11
right I think it's because you don't

2898.87 --> 2904.96
read between the lines a little bit more

2902.11 --> 2908.32
to realize that Elon Musk is giving you

2904.96 --> 2911.19
a wink and a nod by saying hey you know

2908.32 --> 2913.51
it's real because it looks so fake right

2911.19 --> 2916.03
you know I mean like how [ __ ] like

2913.51 --> 2917.92
what a great wink and a nod to the rest

2916.03 --> 2920.3500000000004
of us like I salute all that [ __ ] and

2917.92 --> 2922.84
he's doing he's not down with the mask

2920.35 --> 2925.56
in this cofee you know yeah he really

2922.84 --> 2927.73
broke out against the whole system there

2925.56 --> 2929.95
that's pretty much it uh that was

2927.73 --> 2932.95
unexpected for me but it was pretty like

2929.95 --> 2934.4199999999996
okay okay okay well think about it like

2932.95 --> 2936.7
this thing about gonna make it cause all

2934.42 --> 2938.6800000000003
the things right at leoch which it maybe

2936.7 --> 2940.8999999999996
not makes that stupid car thing all

2938.68 --> 2944.6499999999996
right like that because that just was

2940.9 --> 2946.3
just what the [ __ ] right

2944.65 --> 2949.03
yeah [ __ ] you [ __ ] you said hey you

2946.3 --> 2953.5
know [ __ ] we're off by 10 to the

2949.03 --> 2956.05
whatever's zeros right I mean like you

2953.5 --> 2958.39
know did the movie the principal [ __ ]

2956.05 --> 2961.119
you know it was a great movie you know

2958.39 --> 2964.6589999999997
not the one with Morgan Freeman

2961.119 --> 2967.9590000000003
they shout out to a man I can't shout

2964.659 --> 2969.579
out to grip but we call it the I put

2967.959 --> 2971.469
that idea like that movie the principle

2969.579 --> 2973.539
with all those old quotes from all the

2971.469 --> 2977.4990000000003
old [ __ ] sign you know all the young

2973.539 --> 2978.969
scientists that are old now and they

2977.499 --> 2979.839
were all like basically admitting that

2978.969 --> 2984.779
they don't know anything

2979.839 --> 2991.689
[ __ ] with twit in chat says Kenya musk

2984.779 --> 2995.89
2020 yeah yeah oh you see oh yeah I like

2991.689 --> 2999.339
to note it's because twit knows and

2995.89 --> 3002.3689999999997
wants a world built like Wakanda that

2999.339 --> 3006.709
she understands that and that vaccines

3002.369 --> 3008.759
are from sake I love the Kanye platform

3006.709 --> 3011.3289999999997
you know what I mean like you know we

3008.759 --> 3013.529
want to endow AP though you got a head

3011.329 --> 3015.2690000000002
dude it's the greatest thing ever

3013.529 --> 3018.659
because he can say everything it's like

3015.269 --> 3023.549
this flashy like this really really

3018.659 --> 3026.039
flashy too much modernized version of

3023.549 --> 3027.269
just the religious thing it's the guy

3026.039 --> 3028.829
it's kitsch

3027.269 --> 3032.5789999999997
I think it's kids maybe it's just

3028.829 --> 3035.029
because he hang out with Oh what's her

3032.579 --> 3035.029
name again

3038.779 --> 3044.369
the Kardashians maybe hang her hung

3041.759 --> 3046.89
around with them too long like the kid

3044.369 --> 3050.009
remember yo and Kim Kardashian got out

3046.89 --> 3051.8089999999997
that lady from jail that was in jail for

3050.009 --> 3053.849
[ __ ] like having an ounce of pot or

3051.809 --> 3056.4
something like that and I okay she's

3053.849 --> 3059.009
hurt and I I'm yo these people I'm not

3056.4 --> 3063.599
saying is that it's just that the way

3059.009 --> 3065.459
he's done is it is bro bro you got the

3063.599 --> 3068.219
way I see it like this is that he is

3065.459 --> 3072.239
gonna say everything that we want to be

3068.219 --> 3073.739
said like he's saying [ __ ] vaccines he's

3072.239 --> 3075.479
saying like you know he's saying like

3073.739 --> 3077.759
and then he's going like to the next

3075.479 --> 3080.0389999999998
level of like you know vaccines are from

3077.759 --> 3082.109
st. you know I mean like you know we got

3080.039 --> 3084.0890000000004
you know and that's the it's all the

3082.109 --> 3086.249
[ __ ] that [ __ ] you know it's just

3084.089 --> 3089.0389999999998
hilarious to me right but is that you

3086.249 --> 3089.4599999999996
know but it's got a lot further even and

3089.039 --> 3094.349
say

3089.46 --> 3097.56
we need to completely revolutionize and

3094.349 --> 3100.17
repair the medical system from scratch

3097.56 --> 3103.5
and that starts with the banks basically

3100.17 --> 3105.48
trying to reverse what has happened to

3103.5 --> 3107.82
the entire Western medical system and

3105.48 --> 3109.41
the world medical system since the early

3107.82 --> 3110.9100000000003
20th century when the Rockefeller

3109.41 --> 3113.339
Foundation's start to take control

3110.91 --> 3116.97
through the Red Cross and all that you

3113.339 --> 3120.0
know that because the medical system is

3116.97 --> 3123.5099999999998
a corrupt system kind of from scratch at

3120.0 --> 3126.119
this point for a long time and it always

3123.51 --> 3128.46
been like that surgeons and doctors and

3126.119 --> 3131.73
healers were Revere people that were

3128.46 --> 3133.53
like really awesome well I don't that's

3131.73 --> 3135.51
why man somebody liked it so I'm here to

3133.53 --> 3137.3100000000004
come out and say say you know we need

3135.51 --> 3139.1400000000003
somebody like Kanye to come out and say

3137.31 --> 3141.839
it and this is why I like whether or not

3139.14 --> 3144.06
people are gonna you know immediately

3141.839 --> 3146.94
[ __ ] jump on it like oh yeah did you

3144.06 --> 3148.7999999999997
see uhm like I did you see this thing

3146.94 --> 3153.2400000000002
with the I mentioned it in the chat with

3148.8 --> 3155.25
the RF k junior was asked in the chat

3153.24 --> 3157.08
room to like you know somebody kept

3155.25 --> 3160.349
repeating in the chat hey touch your

3157.08 --> 3162.2999999999997
nose if JFK jr. is still alive

3160.349 --> 3165.03
and he's looking at the chat room and

3162.3 --> 3167.67
you see him any overtly just touches his

3165.03 --> 3169.8
nose you know what I mean so like these

3167.67 --> 3173.2200000000003
out there ideas like there's an idea

3169.8 --> 3175.4700000000003
floating around that you know JFK jr.

3173.22 --> 3177.7799999999997
and Donald Trump put together this plan

3175.47 --> 3180.39
[ __ ] 30 years ago to take out the

3177.78 --> 3183.42
deep state and you know it sounded like

3180.39 --> 3185.79
complete [ __ ] hogwash about six six

3183.42 --> 3187.44
months ago but the more you [ __ ] like

3185.79 --> 3189.089
you know the more this [ __ ] progresses

3187.44 --> 3192.39
it's like it's becomes more and more

3189.089 --> 3194.369
[ __ ] plausible Wow it's I mean

3192.39 --> 3196.68
imagine that [ __ ] imagine that man

3194.369 --> 3200.19
imagine that that Trump and [ __ ] John

3196.68 --> 3203.16
F Kennedy jr. plotted together cuz yo he

3200.19 --> 3205.44
was running a sounds like a movie I mean

3203.16 --> 3206.91
right at I agree I agree it's like you

3205.44 --> 3209.46
know it's the greatest the greatest

3206.91 --> 3214.7999999999997
movie ever [ __ ] being made man live

3209.46 --> 3216.54
on [ __ ] CNN and Fox News but like you

3214.8 --> 3219.15
know and I think and on like you and on

3216.54 --> 3221.16
boards man ah you know the cue and on

3219.15 --> 3222.5
shit's [ __ ] interesting right call it

3221.16 --> 3224.54
Network 2

3222.5 --> 3225.83
you know I mean like think of it how

3224.54 --> 3233.0
else would you get around these

3225.83 --> 3234.95
mainstream media people that's an

3233.0 --> 3238.91
interesting idea that that they would

3234.95 --> 3241.0699999999997
have some team set up but I'm pretty

3238.91 --> 3242.72
sure that the idea of the deep State has

3241.07 --> 3245.1800000000003
been around for a long time but that

3242.72 --> 3247.91
also many parties involved had already

3245.18 --> 3250.85
seen coming that it would be absolutely

3247.91 --> 3254.18
satanically corrupted because those

3250.85 --> 3255.62
people also got involved early and it

3254.18 --> 3258.95
just became more apparent and I think

3255.62 --> 3261.5299999999997
that Trump and yeah maybe some others

3258.95 --> 3264.41
were even halfway to 20th century like

3261.53 --> 3266.6600000000003
yeah did we have another idea

3264.41 --> 3269.7799999999997
we're gonna try it slightly different

3266.66 --> 3271.79
and that's what's kind of unfolding so

3269.78 --> 3275.8300000000004
yeah you may be onto something maybe he

3271.79 --> 3275.83
is involved in that that's interesting

3278.17 --> 3288.29
no yeah yep yeah forgive me yep yep

3282.67 --> 3290.36
forgive me yeah it's interesting stuff

3288.29 --> 3293.39
man and you know did you hear about that

3290.36 --> 3295.52
Waypoint [ __ ] that [ __ ] eye they were

3293.39 --> 3297.98
saying dude this [ __ ] this one company

3295.52 --> 3300.5
so it was selling these cabinets for

3297.98 --> 3303.56
like 20 grand and it would have like the

3300.5 --> 3307.1
name of like a young girl or a young boy

3303.56 --> 3309.41
attached and then if you took the SKU

3307.1 --> 3311.99
number the SKU number and put it into

3309.41 --> 3318.43
Google it comes up with missing children

3311.99 --> 3318.43
and [ __ ] yeah that's disgusting right

3323.26 --> 3329.0
and right now these guys you know I

3326.36 --> 3331.04
don't know but it looks like you know it

3329.0 --> 3332.51
makes me almost wonder like I don't know

3331.04 --> 3334.79
if like imagine like this information

3332.51 --> 3337.8500000000004
was coming out of someone like Ghislaine

3334.79 --> 3339.41
Maxwell who was just arrested and she's

3337.85 --> 3341.33
giving him the information of how they

3339.41 --> 3342.92
were selling the kids and then [ __ ]

3341.33 --> 3345.35
now they're going to the mainstream it's

3342.92 --> 3348.9700000000003
showing all of us how the [ __ ] they were

3345.35 --> 3352.1
doing it so we can [ __ ] rat him out

3348.97 --> 3353.9599999999996
this is why I said citizen journalism is

3352.1 --> 3356.21
so important and that's why citizen

3353.96 --> 3358.46
journalism you know it pops up

3356.21 --> 3360.7400000000002
where the information is so whoever the

3358.46 --> 3362.119
citizen is do your job share the

3360.74 --> 3366.02
information like are you following

3362.119 --> 3369.56
project Veritas at all oh yeah yeah well

3366.02 --> 3371.869
not really close up but yeah the name is

3369.56 --> 3374.21
very familiar he's also very Alex Jones

3371.869 --> 3376.46
Show for a time and and against it I

3374.21 --> 3379.43
think even oh yeah they did do an expose

3376.46 --> 3382.099
on face if you don't expose days on

3379.43 --> 3386.3489999999997
Facebook recently mmm-hmm and how they

3382.099 --> 3388.28
were banning conservatives and [ __ ] and

3386.349 --> 3389.7200000000003
you know it just makes me think like

3388.28 --> 3391.73
these are the same folks that were

3389.72 --> 3395.77
fighting us over flat earth [ __ ] a

3391.73 --> 3403.609
couple years ago in my opinion hmm

3395.77 --> 3405.95
you know same drivel I just can't wait

3403.609 --> 3408.98
till the BLM people figure out that

3405.95 --> 3411.5
evolution is practically the you know

3408.98 --> 3413.9
the confirmation of all [ __ ] white

3411.5 --> 3419.99
supremacy and then they're gonna have a

3413.9 --> 3422.54
real [ __ ] mind [ __ ] hmm

3419.99 --> 3424.8799999999997
I don't know what of it but will they

3422.54 --> 3427.31
even get that for do they even care

3424.88 --> 3432.38
isn't the whole BLM thing at this point

3427.31 --> 3434.869
just only about power well there's the

3432.38 --> 3437.599
BLM [ __ ] thing and then there's these

3434.869 --> 3440.48
young college kids that are actually

3437.599 --> 3442.4300000000003
nice people that are going along with

3440.48 --> 3444.68
this because they want some form of

3442.43 --> 3447.1699999999996
social justice because they're naive and

3444.68 --> 3448.73
they're nice people all right but and

3447.17 --> 3451.28
when they figure out that they got

3448.73 --> 3455.45
[ __ ] used by BLM it's gonna be a wrap

3451.28 --> 3457.19
for BLM but I think you know there's

3455.45 --> 3458.5099999999998
that there's that element of like you

3457.19 --> 3460.55
know if you're gonna be one of these

3458.51 --> 3461.869
like you know anti like let's say you

3460.55 --> 3464.6600000000003
look at these people they're all pro

3461.869 --> 3467.03
science and they're anti you know

3464.66 --> 3469.0989999999997
they're ant like anti fascist and

3467.03 --> 3471.5600000000004
they're against racism and then whatever

3469.099 --> 3473.9300000000003
but you know because for scientific

3471.56 --> 3475.94
reasons well what's gonna happen when

3473.93 --> 3477.79
Flat Earth and all this information hits

3475.94 --> 3480.5
them in the head and says hey you know

3477.79 --> 3485.89
evolution is the theory that actually

3480.5 --> 3488.99
promulgates white supremacy dude right

3485.89 --> 3491.18
yeah I'm bleaching out over the ages

3488.99 --> 3493.7599999999998
right like you know we're that way to

3491.18 --> 3496.46
the next form of evolution for a man

3493.76 --> 3498.4100000000003
right the next step in [ __ ] greatness

3496.46 --> 3502.31
it kind of it yeah I know what you mean

3498.41 --> 3505.8489999999997
in the storyline of yeah that you're

3502.31 --> 3508.82
right so how are they how do these PLM

3505.849 --> 3510.6800000000003
Ed's gonna reconcile that you know and

3508.82 --> 3512.54
then my problem is that the problem I

3510.68 --> 3513.7999999999997
see is that if they're gonna want to

3512.54 --> 3516.02
burn it all down cuz they're gonna be

3513.8 --> 3518.0600000000004
like oh I can't handle the cognitive

3516.02 --> 3521.869
dissonance so I'm gonna want to burn it

3518.06 --> 3523.43
all down like a [ __ ] [ __ ] you know

3521.869 --> 3525.349
what I mean and they're gonna even like

3523.43 --> 3529.31
you know I respect evolution as a theory

3525.349 --> 3530.81
because I don't [ __ ] know but I'm not

3529.31 --> 3534.23
gonna go around telling everyone this is

3530.81 --> 3538.16
how it is there okay well if that's how

3534.23 --> 3543.5
it is you're a white supremacist with

3538.16 --> 3545.839
your [ __ ] evolution is a good one

3543.5 --> 3549.2
right so the cognitive dissonance is

3545.839 --> 3553.25
just going to be off the charts and I

3549.2 --> 3554.96
yeah man I don't know well yeah but how

3553.25 --> 3556.58
are people just gonna respond you know

3554.96 --> 3559.76
because the cognitive dissonance is

3556.58 --> 3562.2799999999997
already kind of off the charts we could

3559.76 --> 3564.44
state that even the the normy now has

3562.28 --> 3566.63
some kind of cognitive dissonance issue

3564.44 --> 3568.2200000000003
because everything is out of whack the

3566.63 --> 3570.17
news is already out of whack

3568.22 --> 3573.02
politics is out of whack the medical

3570.17 --> 3575.42
system is getting out of whack and so

3573.02 --> 3576.68
there's already like at some point you

3575.42 --> 3579.05
know if there's too much cognitive

3576.68 --> 3581.5099999999998
dissonance then people are going to find

3579.05 --> 3584.42
another way to orient themselves within

3581.51 --> 3586.9900000000002
the situation well how are they gonna do

3584.42 --> 3589.609
that what is going to be the intuitive

3586.99 --> 3593.77
response in order to deal with the

3589.609 --> 3593.77
madness that is increasing in intensity

3595.03 --> 3602.51
besides figuring it out and yeah and

3599.5 --> 3606.92
really getting to know the truth what do

3602.51 --> 3608.8390000000004
you think yeah I think well I think it's

3606.92 --> 3610.4
gonna be you know hey you know as funny

3608.839 --> 3612.29
as it sounds are when it's gonna be

3610.4 --> 3612.92
people like you out here saving the

3612.29 --> 3615.04
world man

3612.92 --> 3621.569
you know just offering the information

3615.04 --> 3625.24
right [ __ ] it hold it yeah

3621.569 --> 3626.89
yo because you're gonna have when they

3625.24 --> 3633.7
said that people don't even understand

3626.89 --> 3635.98
what the [ __ ] I was saying the future so

3633.7 --> 3637.3289999999997
that hasn't even happened yet it's

3635.98 --> 3640.109
something that I thought that had

3637.329 --> 3642.51
happened back then but I only saw things

3640.109 --> 3646.0
so yeah maybe it is

3642.51 --> 3648.0690000000004
III have it would at least get me some

3646.0 --> 3652.359
kind of feeling like okay well at least

3648.069 --> 3656.38
I made worth I made worth what I am at

3652.359 --> 3658.7799999999997
least I saved at least I was like at

3656.38 --> 3664.0
least I wasn't completely useless that's

3658.78 --> 3672.6400000000003
really but yes me and my over demanding

3664.0 --> 3676.63
overbearing attitude to watch myself for

3672.64 --> 3679.23
president oh really am I so great that

3676.63 --> 3679.23
would be fantastic

3679.47 --> 3686.109
we are we know I might actually but

3682.799 --> 3688.24
maybe because I'm crazy that would act

3686.109 --> 3690.25
maybe because I'm incapable of just

3688.24 --> 3704.5
normally of communicating with the

3690.25 --> 3710.14
normal but I mean I'm Dutch I'm born

3704.5 --> 3712.329
raised Dutch it's just yeah amazing I

3710.14 --> 3718.8089999999997
might be president of benevolence agouti

3712.329 --> 3721.23
and then what you know you with the

3718.809 --> 3721.23
Netherlands

3724.589 --> 3731.729
I would be a dictated but that doesn't

3729.119 --> 3736.219
work flatlander you can't be a dictator

3731.729 --> 3736.2189999999996
unless people let you be a dictator

3745.489 --> 3761.359
flatland just says that I would be a

3747.93 --> 3761.359
dictator with thank you for telling me

3764.86 --> 3767.929
[Music]

3840.029 --> 3843.839
perspectives around you know I haven't

3842.009 --> 3847.439
really had the opportunity to be online

3843.839 --> 3849.839
as much lately and I but hopefully when

3847.439 --> 3850.83
I do I just don't have a don't have a

3849.839 --> 3852.66
Internet

3850.83 --> 3855.36
right now I'm working on a couple doing

3852.66 --> 3857.1299999999997
a couple things but uh when I do I'll

3855.36 --> 3860.28
frickin start hosting some slider this

3857.13 --> 3861.9900000000002
chord again I think and having some of

3860.28 --> 3863.67
the old-school heads that I'm in

3861.99 --> 3865.14
connection with you know come back on

3863.67 --> 3866.55
and just talk about everything that's

3865.14 --> 3869.46
going down because like you know me and

3866.55 --> 3871.7400000000002
you know like affects us of myself back

3869.46 --> 3873.18
in the day you know our thing was like

3871.74 --> 3875.85
you know hey we're the [ __ ] of the

3873.18 --> 3877.71
adults you know I mean like think about

3875.85 --> 3879.5699999999997
like this like the mayor of [ __ ] New

3877.71 --> 3881.82
York City pardon my language mayor in

3879.57 --> 3883.8300000000004
New York City was out there telling

3881.82 --> 3886.65
people that they can't go to their few

3883.83 --> 3888.69
like their parents funerals they can't

3886.65 --> 3891.6600000000003
go to church but he's going to go out

3888.69 --> 3894.39
there without a mast mind you and

3891.66 --> 3896.91
[ __ ] paint black lives matter in

3894.39 --> 3900.8399999999997
front of the Trump Towers like what a

3896.91 --> 3902.8199999999997
[ __ ] [ __ ] now he's at I'm so fed up

3900.84 --> 3905.34
with these people I mean what a fricking

3902.82 --> 3907.9500000000003
lose like where are the adults I don't

3905.34 --> 3911.28
get why he isn't being just tell me

3907.95 --> 3914.1899999999996
rotten tomato constantly what this play

3911.28 --> 3916.02
get where is my face where is this like

3914.19 --> 3920.0
they did this to Bill Gates where's the

3916.02 --> 3926.52
where's the pie face for this is insane

3920.0 --> 3928.53
mayor yeah I don't you know that's work

3926.52 --> 3930.03
and that's what makes me realize that

3928.53 --> 3932.61
like you know I think that really we

3930.03 --> 3935.5800000000004
live in a system that allows for the

3932.61 --> 3939.81
individual to sit on top of the you know

3935.58 --> 3941.88
to be the I on top of the pyramid you

3939.81 --> 3943.89
know I mean and like you are on top of

3941.88 --> 3947.19
the pyramid and there's no other adults

3943.89 --> 3948.87
around but that's okay because in the

3947.19 --> 3951.2400000000002
system if we learn how to navigate it

3948.87 --> 3955.0699999999997
correctly we can dissuade those people

3951.24 --> 3955.0699999999997
from having any authority over our lives

3955.55 --> 3961.8
that's interesting yeah because like you

3959.88 --> 3963.57
know like you're right you know it's

3961.8 --> 3966.3300000000004
like look it's like I've gotten around

3963.57 --> 3968.1600000000003
you know like I came here and I was

3966.33 --> 3970.17
basically like yeah I'm got kicked out

3968.16 --> 3972.45
now I have to find a room and get social

3970.17 --> 3974.85
welfare and like everybody was having

3972.45 --> 3976.35
this attitude towards me like you're in

3974.85 --> 3977.43
the system now now that means that

3976.35 --> 3980.1
you're gonna have to listen to us

3977.43 --> 3983.29
telling you what you have to do now and

3980.1 --> 3986.2599999999998
at some point I was just like no

3983.29 --> 3987.58
now I'm gonna be really oppositional II

3986.26 --> 3990.67
and just say no I'm not gonna do that

3987.58 --> 3993.4
[ __ ] anymore and you sir person sitting

3990.67 --> 3997.4500000000003
there you're not gonna you're not gonna

3993.4 --> 3999.1
cost me things because I have a reason

3997.45 --> 4000.99
for not wanting to do this anymore and I

3999.1 --> 4002.8199999999997
even explained back then like yeah I am

4000.99 --> 4004.83
trying with things with YouTube and its

4002.82 --> 4006.75
really slow start but I will get

4004.83 --> 4009.0
somewhere someday but if you're gonna

4006.75 --> 4012.9
force me to basically wreck myself just

4009.0 --> 4014.67
to be part of the standard system that's

4012.9 --> 4016.9500000000003
gonna destroy my plans I'm gonna take

4014.67 --> 4020.1
that person I'm gonna revenge myself on

4016.95 --> 4022.8599999999997
you for having made that decision to

4020.1 --> 4028.16
downgrade me well see that's right and

4022.86 --> 4031.6800000000003
then they were like okay okay we'll just

4028.16 --> 4033.24
we'll just put your case on there it's a

4031.68 --> 4035.6099999999997
little bit more easy there did that

4033.24 --> 4038.0099999999998
literally what happened that's good all

4035.61 --> 4039.57
right and I think see my approach though

4038.01 --> 4041.82
I guess and something I tried there's

4039.57 --> 4043.53
just a spouse is the idea like you know

4041.82 --> 4045.27
like instead of saying like you know I

4043.53 --> 4047.61
love Mykel society listen to Michael

4045.27 --> 4050.1
caesarean all the time I love that that

4047.61 --> 4052.05
dudes insight on certain things and I

4050.1 --> 4053.4
and he said like you know how at one

4052.05 --> 4055.2000000000003
point you know he was he was talking

4053.4 --> 4059.37
about how you have to fall in love with

4055.2 --> 4061.5299999999997
the idea of saying no you know and you

4059.37 --> 4064.98
know and rejecting what people offer you

4061.53 --> 4067.11
as you know whatever but in my opinion I

4064.98 --> 4069.0
think that is you know in the beginning

4067.11 --> 4070.9500000000003
you met you know you should you know you

4069.0 --> 4073.26
have like you know a reserve of like hey

4070.95 --> 4077.49
no I'm not gonna accept your [ __ ]

4073.26 --> 4079.4700000000003
but in interfacing with the society you

4077.49 --> 4081.12
know I've come to find like I've said

4079.47 --> 4083.25
for years is this concept of conditional

4081.12 --> 4086.46
acceptance it's like you know hey I'd

4083.25 --> 4091.2
love to do that so long as you're gonna

4086.46 --> 4093.26
be liable for having denied me let's say

4091.2 --> 4096.21
equal protection due process of law

4093.26 --> 4098.52
access to you know whatever the right

4096.21 --> 4100.08
like I'm gonna make it like you know

4098.52 --> 4102.779
make it a because it becomes more

4100.08 --> 4105.0289999999995
agreeable between the parties because

4102.779 --> 4107.549000000001
you're not looking at it like a personal

4105.029 --> 4109.38
issue like you know somebody's mad at

4107.549 --> 4111.7789999999995
you for trying to deny something you're

4109.38 --> 4112.67
just saying hey look seeing as it's just

4111.779 --> 4115.5
business

4112.67 --> 4116.6
and seeing as you may have denied me

4115.5 --> 4119.51
this that and the other

4116.6 --> 4123.17
wouldn't you be liable to pay as much

4119.51 --> 4125.33
you know like it totally right it is how

4123.17 --> 4127.7300000000005
I would do it I haven't even had anybody

4125.33 --> 4130.3099999999995
approached me yet about this corona

4127.73 --> 4132.49
nonce and so far except for really

4130.31 --> 4134.93
stressed out people that were like yeah

4132.49 --> 4137.719999999999
basically getting nutso for the corona

4134.93 --> 4139.55
situation but nobody literally tried to

4137.72 --> 4141.2300000000005
force me to do anything but I would

4139.55 --> 4144.08
approach it exactly like that I would

4141.23 --> 4147.98
say like like this if willing to be

4144.08 --> 4149.96
liable it's like if you go into a store

4147.98 --> 4151.7
I mean I've said I think this is the

4149.96 --> 4153.2300000000005
move if you go into a store and they're

4151.7 --> 4155.09
gonna actually I just saw a video of it

4153.23 --> 4157.73
the other day a guy went into bed and

4155.09 --> 4160.64
Bath and Beyond and he I guess he had a

4157.73 --> 4163.639999999999
Trump face mask on and look and and the

4160.64 --> 4165.83
lady wouldn't serve them and so he

4163.64 --> 4167.6
pulled out his phone and he filmed it

4165.83 --> 4169.97
and he said so you're not gonna serve me

4167.6 --> 4171.9800000000005
because I have a Trump face mask and you

4169.97 --> 4174.530000000001
said [ __ ] Trump and she goes yeah [ __ ]

4171.98 --> 4177.32
Trump that's how I feel well it's like

4174.53 --> 4179.57
okay now what he needed to and I I don't

4177.32 --> 4182.599999999999
know what became of it but if he took

4179.57 --> 4184.61
that video and sent an email along or

4182.6 --> 4187.46
did whatever necessary to contact Bed

4184.61 --> 4191.599999999999
Bath & Beyond he could sue the living

4187.46 --> 4193.1
[ __ ] out of them yeah and like you know

4191.6 --> 4195.530000000001
and that's what needs to be done when we

4193.1 --> 4198.35
learn how to exercise exercise our

4195.53 --> 4200.179999999999
rights under this system the

4198.35 --> 4202.43
corporations are gonna be terrified this

4200.18 --> 4204.71
is why they're bowing to the black lives

4202.43 --> 4207.860000000001
matter clique because this is what

4204.71 --> 4209.78
they've done almost they've threatened

4207.86 --> 4212.48
therefore their business so therefore

4209.78 --> 4215.719999999999
they're gonna cow down to them well in

4212.48 --> 4217.07
like in like turn you know even like I

4215.72 --> 4220.37
love that Bill Barr said the

4217.07 --> 4222.7699999999995
Constitution is never suspended there's

4220.37 --> 4224.63
no you know you have no authority to do

4222.77 --> 4226.55
that's why even for myself if I get you

4224.63 --> 4228.11
know if an officer wants to search my

4226.55 --> 4230.4800000000005
vehicle while I'm driving down the road

4228.11 --> 4232.58
I'm gonna make me like hey look I'd love

4230.48 --> 4234.11
to let you do that so long as you

4232.58 --> 4236.03
understand you're accepting a ten

4234.11 --> 4238.429999999999
thousand dollar penalty for denying

4236.03 --> 4240.74
equal protection due process of law for

4238.43 --> 4243.5
make for making a traffic stop with

4240.74 --> 4246.62
without probable cause having been you

4243.5 --> 4248.949
know you know without probable cause so

4246.62 --> 4251.5599999999995
because those are my rights

4248.949 --> 4254.379999999999
in the morning and anyone from any other

4251.56 --> 4257.4400000000005
country you live under the same [ __ ]

4254.38 --> 4260.02
system and if you want to learn about

4257.44 --> 4261.94
your rights study the American system

4260.02 --> 4264.6990000000005
because it's going to be almost

4261.94 --> 4267.07
identical wherever you are under the

4264.699 --> 4270.969
International Monetary Fund or whatever

4267.07 --> 4272.41
Disney I am asked it's a really

4270.969 --> 4274.929
beautiful system and when you learn how

4272.41 --> 4277.15
to bark these people back you'll start

4274.929 --> 4280.0
to be like oh my god this is awesome

4277.15 --> 4282.5199999999995
because now you can shut down all the

4280.0 --> 4284.62
Karen's you can shut down all the you

4282.52 --> 4287.4400000000005
can shut down everybody who's going to

4284.62 --> 4291.73
come against you you know if you want to

4287.44 --> 4293.949
put it in the effort to do it it's

4291.73 --> 4296.889999999999
interesting yeah good point

4293.949 --> 4299.199
so you can basically just disable the

4296.89 --> 4302.17
entire virtual system where other people

4299.199 --> 4304.48
get caught up in the width you can as

4302.17 --> 4306.1
another for right through it every time

4304.48 --> 4307.57
right it's like it's like this like take

4306.1 --> 4309.55
like with a court case it's like you

4307.57 --> 4311.23
know if you do your paperwork and

4309.55 --> 4313.150000000001
everything correctly and you know you're

4311.23 --> 4315.009999999999
and you're in the right like you know if

4313.15 --> 4317.11
you're in the right you know like take

4315.01 --> 4319.650000000001
like this way I always felt inclined to

4317.11 --> 4321.549999999999
show people about law who smoke pot

4319.65 --> 4322.87
because I always felt like you know

4321.55 --> 4325.51
there's nobody should be in jail for

4322.87 --> 4327.34
[ __ ] smoking weed and so if that's

4325.51 --> 4329.31
the case you know like those are the

4327.34 --> 4331.4800000000005
types of people that I would want to be

4329.31 --> 4334.870000000001
knowledgeable in this stuff not like you

4331.48 --> 4336.218999999999
know selfish awful criminal people you

4334.87 --> 4340.15
know and I mean but if you have like a

4336.219 --> 4341.44
legitimate right you know take like

4340.15 --> 4343.179
you're trying to go to church during

4341.44 --> 4346.509999999999
Kove it and they're gonna come after you

4343.179 --> 4349.09
you know I'd sue the living [ __ ] [ __ ]

4346.51 --> 4350.7390000000005
out of these people you know I mean you

4349.09 --> 4352.39
know and and do it but you have to know

4350.739 --> 4354.428999999999
how you'd have to know how to do it you

4352.39 --> 4356.38
can't just go get an attorney cuz

4354.429 --> 4358.66
there's all the rules of law and all you

4356.38 --> 4360.37
know attorneys work for the courts and

4358.66 --> 4363.37
the courts work for their [ __ ]

4360.37 --> 4365.83
lobbyists to some extent mm-hmm but they

4363.37 --> 4369.099999999999
can't work for their lobbyists if you

4365.83 --> 4371.05
know your [ __ ] so no matter how corrupt

4369.1 --> 4373.360000000001
they are if you really know your [ __ ]

4371.05 --> 4375.67
they can't do what they're trying to do

4373.36 --> 4378.9
because there's a stenographer they're

4375.67 --> 4380.34
writing it all down mm-hm

4378.9 --> 4382.86
okay

4380.34 --> 4385.110000000001
this is a little bit out of my league

4382.86 --> 4388.44
though but it's good at fights very ISA

4385.11 --> 4392.91
a glad you figured out a way how to get

4388.44 --> 4396.12
through it technically and I don't know

4392.91 --> 4397.68
if it's ever gonna get as crazy as as it

4396.12 --> 4400.86
is in the United States with the whole

4397.68 --> 4403.650000000001
corona situation it's because yeah over

4400.86 --> 4406.799999999999
here it's there are so there's just it's

4403.65 --> 4409.259999999999
more sporadic there's not a lot of

4406.8 --> 4411.03
hassle really so far although they like

4409.26 --> 4415.2
to put as much of it on the news as

4411.03 --> 4417.96
possible but compared to United States

4415.2 --> 4420.33
things are really mild over here so yeah

4417.96 --> 4425.22
I've never bumped into even a single

4420.33 --> 4427.74
situation in person yeah I mean I think

4425.22 --> 4430.08
this is just an American political thing

4427.74 --> 4432.96
anyway going on like again we're the

4430.08 --> 4436.61
last nation that's armed to the [ __ ]

4432.96 --> 4439.56
teeth bro mm-hmm we're the last ones

4436.61 --> 4444.599999999999
yeah you know all you guys got your guns

4439.56 --> 4446.22
take it away yeah that's true yeah we

4444.6 --> 4451.26
didn't so that's why the [ __ ] show's

4446.22 --> 4453.780000000001
over here makes sense yeah that yeah but

4451.26 --> 4455.88
you know the gun situation that's really

4453.78 --> 4457.259999999999
one of the primary things of the New

4455.88 --> 4459.84
World Order people don't really talk

4457.26 --> 4461.85
about it too much anymore no and that's

4459.84 --> 4463.89
how you know Trump is alright because he

4461.85 --> 4466.13
never [ __ ] he's not going after people

4463.89 --> 4469.17
if they if Trump was an evil dictator

4466.13 --> 4472.17
like these you know like you know like

4469.17 --> 4475.4400000000005
all the conspirators are convinced up

4472.17 --> 4476.76
then like you know then [ __ ] um you

4475.44 --> 4478.53
know then he would have taken the guns

4476.76 --> 4481.2
but you know remember like the

4478.53 --> 4484.62
conspirators are almost on like almost

4481.2 --> 4487.11
the BLM tards because they're the same

4484.62 --> 4490.23
folks that are like you know uh destroy

4487.11 --> 4491.719999999999
the system you know what I mean like you

4490.23 --> 4493.7699999999995
know you're missing the [ __ ] point

4491.72 --> 4495.96
and then they want to come and talk

4493.77 --> 4497.67
about Anarchy and you're like oh are you

4495.96 --> 4500.49
familiar with Mikhail Bakunin

4497.67 --> 4502.26
and they're like who's that and you're

4500.49 --> 4506.219999999999
like oh it's the father of Anarchy

4502.26 --> 4508.83
[ __ ] idiot I didn't know who that

4506.22 --> 4510.6
haze by the way but yeah make it [ __ ]

4508.83 --> 4512.91
so pissed off with political [ __ ]

4510.6 --> 4515.02
[ __ ] all right

4512.91 --> 4516.88
it's like if you're gonna be a [ __ ]

4515.02 --> 4518.950000000001
anarchist okay well then what do you

4516.88 --> 4521.14
know about bakunin oh you don't okay

4518.95 --> 4522.73
shut the [ __ ] up and I love Reagan's

4521.14 --> 4525.1
quote Reagan does a great quote

4522.73 --> 4528.879999999999
he's like communists are people that

4525.1 --> 4531.43
have read Marx and Lenin anti-communists

4528.88 --> 4535.93
are people that understood Marx and

4531.43 --> 4542.89
Lenin thank you yeah that is definitely

4535.93 --> 4547.18
I agreed to that yeah yeah it took some

4542.89 --> 4549.88
time now before I like that to the fact

4547.18 --> 4551.77
to sink through to me as it were that's

4549.88 --> 4553.42
why I can't ever be to like you know if

4551.77 --> 4555.790000000001
I'm around I mean I know a lot of people

4553.42 --> 4556.78
I'm around all kinds of people and I've

4555.79 --> 4559.03
been around like you know the anarchist

4556.78 --> 4561.82
types and you know essentially what I

4559.03 --> 4564.969999999999
think is that when they figure out that

4561.82 --> 4567.49
they've been duped all that rage is

4564.97 --> 4569.2
gonna go towards the [ __ ] foundations

4567.49 --> 4571.84
like Soros and all these people that

4569.2 --> 4574.87
created this [ __ ] show and when that

4571.84 --> 4577.2
happens it'll be a [ __ ] glorious day

4574.87 --> 4581.53
[Music]

4577.2 --> 4584.92
or the start of a giant unfolding

4581.53 --> 4587.7699999999995
distraction like a trap finally

4584.92 --> 4590.35
unfolding that could also just you know

4587.77 --> 4594.13
well all these people that are doing

4590.35 --> 4597.280000000001
this they have such insane amounts of

4594.13 --> 4599.59
wealth and connections it's like they're

4597.28 --> 4601.509999999999
always going to eventually maximize

4599.59 --> 4603.7
their moves until they run out of moves

4601.51 --> 4605.650000000001
and then things are gonna blow up one

4603.7 --> 4606.91
way or the other well I think that's

4605.65 --> 4608.62
what's going on right now is that

4606.91 --> 4611.11
they're all trapped in this whole

4608.62 --> 4613.15
[ __ ] epstein [ __ ] show and all the

4611.11 --> 4614.74
rest of it that they're only you know

4613.15 --> 4616.299999999999
they're like little babies trying to

4614.74 --> 4618.19
throw all their toys out of the print

4616.3 --> 4620.95
you know out of their [ __ ] out of the

4618.19 --> 4623.049999999999
crib because they're just wanna they

4620.95 --> 4627.34
want to destroy everything because

4623.05 --> 4628.63
they're about to get caught hmm hmm

4627.34 --> 4630.46
that's interesting yeah you might be

4628.63 --> 4632.92
right so it's like you know so it's like

4630.46 --> 4634.93
calm you know be calm cool collected and

4632.92 --> 4636.58
just you know all they're gonna burn

4634.93 --> 4638.77
down is their own house anyway

4636.58 --> 4640.66
and then they're so dumb they're gonna

4638.77 --> 4646.71
burn it all down and it's gonna leave

4640.66 --> 4657.55
all their crimes exposed yeah probably

4646.71 --> 4659.77
yeah interesting yeah I think it's yeah

4657.55 --> 4661.09
I mean God willing it'll be you know and

4659.77 --> 4662.740000000001
that willing would come through all this

4661.09 --> 4665.17
in one piece and everyone's okay and

4662.74 --> 4667.12
[ __ ] everyone still can be cool you

4665.17 --> 4670.72
know cuz nobody wants war it's only

4667.12 --> 4674.38
people that have not seen more that want

4670.72 --> 4676.030000000001
war or want fights you know it's always

4674.38 --> 4679.96
like the biggest you know what you know

4676.03 --> 4683.5
allow it's the you know the empty drum

4679.96 --> 4688.33
is the loudest yeah that's a good one

4683.5 --> 4691.06
right so you know these people like you

4688.33 --> 4694.15
know I don't know God knows

4691.06 --> 4697.93
yeah and barking dogs don't bite also in

4694.15 --> 4701.44
that car right yeah that's it you know

4697.93 --> 4704.2300000000005
so I mean God willing it's like that's

4701.44 --> 4705.7
intense emails I got all these I don't

4704.23 --> 4709.089999999999
know it's interesting what's going on

4705.7 --> 4711.19
then I'm surprised more people aren't

4709.09 --> 4712.87
interested in that or maybe I'm just you

4711.19 --> 4714.629999999999
know focused on the flatter us sometimes

4712.87 --> 4717.21
but I think it's a it's an interesting

4714.63 --> 4720.25
dissection or you know cross-sections

4717.21 --> 4721.72
conspiracy worlds and then it saddens me

4720.25 --> 4723.85
when I hear a lot of flat earthers sort

4721.72 --> 4726.7
of like oh yeah queue and on is just so

4723.85 --> 4728.8
dumb LARP it's like wow you look like

4726.7 --> 4732.5199999999995
you really did your research there homie

4728.8 --> 4734.02
you [ __ ] idiot cuz like it's apparent

4732.52 --> 4735.040000000001
that there's a lot more going on like

4734.02 --> 4738.01
for instance I don't know if you can

4735.04 --> 4741.04
solve in the last month Q and I was

4738.01 --> 4743.71
talking about take the oath and then

4741.04 --> 4745.81
general Flynn just got exonerated and on

4743.71 --> 4746.32
his Twitter it's like hashtag take the

4745.81 --> 4749.830000000001
oath

4746.32 --> 4752.259999999999
I mean it's [ __ ] you know the

4749.83 --> 4756.37
coincidences are off the charts man like

4752.26 --> 4760.24
that's interesting but you know that Q q

4756.37 --> 4762.37
and on I think that it's not as exactly

4760.24 --> 4766.57
what it says it is but it's like a more

4762.37 --> 4770.2
an open-ended project that well is being

4766.57 --> 4770.509999999999
utilized by those group so I think there

4770.2 --> 4773.42
is

4770.51 --> 4776.269
something to it although is it exactly

4773.42 --> 4777.769
well here's the thing you know I look

4776.269 --> 4781.099
kind of like this like so cute on

4777.769 --> 4783.769
releasing flatters [ __ ] right and then

4781.099 --> 4786.38
really a but yeah I need like you know

4783.769 --> 4787.909000000001
it and some I think fake NASA [ __ ] if

4786.38 --> 4790.4890000000005
I'm not surprised from back of the day

4787.909 --> 4792.409
so let anyway hold on so somebody is

4790.489 --> 4795.768999999999
somebody asked queuing on they said hey

4792.409 --> 4800.9
is the earth flat and Q and on type back

4795.769 --> 4807.1990000000005
no now we all [ __ ] know that the

4800.9 --> 4810.28
earth is not flat it has topography hold

4807.199 --> 4816.348999999999
on listen to me only what you mean if

4810.28 --> 4822.38
hold on if elevation exists we're not on

4816.349 --> 4825.32
something completely flat right what do

4822.38 --> 4828.289
you mean I mean if there is an altitude

4825.32 --> 4830.929
like if I can go up a mountain then

4828.289 --> 4832.88
obviously the earth from where I started

4830.929 --> 4836.469
and where I [ __ ] ended up are not

4832.88 --> 4839.179
flat but you're interpreting the

4836.469 --> 4841.309
interesting is the word flat in a very

4839.179 --> 4843.8
easy topographical manner and not a

4841.309 --> 4846.320000000001
geometrically orientating manner we'd

4843.8 --> 4848.3
write because I whale is Mendez really

4846.32 --> 4851.719
right because I'm using it as the truth

4848.3 --> 4854.719
because the earth is technically not

4851.719 --> 4857.179
flat right it doesn't mean it's a space

4854.719 --> 4860.019
ball it doesn't like I go like this the

4857.179 --> 4864.1990000000005
earth is flat in proportion to the hole

4860.019 --> 4866.150000000001
okay how's that suit yet sure or did you

4864.199 --> 4868.789
get your crew orientation of whatever

4866.15 --> 4869.589999999999
whatever whatever whatever what -

4868.789 --> 4872.389
nothing

4869.59 --> 4874.519
ok fine but it's like you know my thing

4872.389 --> 4877.219
is that like the earth is not entirely

4874.519 --> 4879.5
flat ok because we have mountains and

4877.219 --> 4881.78
[ __ ] topography and valleys and

4879.5 --> 4884.3
mariana trenches and all kinds of [ __ ]

4881.78 --> 4886.55
so the point is that it's not flat in

4884.3 --> 4889.55
that context so q was right

4886.55 --> 4892.519
okay it's not flat alright he answered

4889.55 --> 4896.389
topographically right geometrically

4892.519 --> 4900.849
which was the actual leg it wasn't

4896.389 --> 4902.92
specified okay if somebody'd ask him

4900.849 --> 4907.18
electrically flat then he

4902.92 --> 4909.82
not answered fair enough but like you

4907.18 --> 4913.92
know the idea that for 90% of the people

4909.82 --> 4916.929999999999
that helped them except queuing on

4913.92 --> 4918.67
because if he would have said yes the

4916.93 --> 4921.31
earth is flat every would have been like

4918.67 --> 4923.86
[ __ ] you queueing on because we all need

4921.31 --> 4929.620000000001
space and don't you see just Elon Musk's

4923.86 --> 4931.24
just put a car up in space okay so but

4929.62 --> 4934.09
the truth is is that the earth isn't

4931.24 --> 4936.28
flat unless you're gonna qualify in my

4934.09 --> 4938.4400000000005
opinion with and unless you can say

4936.28 --> 4940.57
proportions to the whole in proportions

4938.44 --> 4942.73
of the whole thing yeah it might look

4940.57 --> 4944.74
like a [ __ ] you know flat lumpy

4942.73 --> 4948.61
pancake from [ __ ] 10 million miles

4944.74 --> 4950.83
away I don't know but but like you know

4948.61 --> 4953.049999999999
but the idea is that like you know we

4950.83 --> 4956.55
are not experiencing curvature or yada

4953.05 --> 4960.070000000001
yada yada I'm so over the discussions

4956.55 --> 4962.74
shake the earth I've had enough of it

4960.07 --> 4964.96
man I'm so done with it you know it's

4962.74 --> 4967.09
like I'm so it's yeah unless you're

4964.96 --> 4970.15
gonna entertain somebody you really care

4967.09 --> 4973.4800000000005
about and debate with them over the

4970.15 --> 4975.49
minutiae [ __ ] Riley's criteria you

4973.48 --> 4977.95
know I don't know how the [ __ ] you mean

4975.49 --> 4981.04
oh yeah I get what you mean well I

4977.95 --> 4984.46
myself am kind of like not really doing

4981.04 --> 4986.53
that unless I'm just playing around with

4984.46 --> 4988.6
people and I can emulate a ball but what

4986.53 --> 4990.75
I do mostly it's just work on two sides

4988.6 --> 4995.22
like okay and at the same time I am

4990.75 --> 4998.5
going at the presuppositional

4995.22 --> 5001.9800000000005
preponderance of the heliocentric Legacy

4998.5 --> 5003.42
story and at the same time actual Cosmo

5001.98 --> 5005.099999999999
Jeannie and then building on my own

5003.42 --> 5006.66
presuppositions from there on so it's

5005.1 --> 5011.240000000001
just working on these two things but

5006.66 --> 5014.49
actually getting them together yeah why

5011.24 --> 5016.11
because the only reason why Globus don't

5014.49 --> 5018.63
see it is because they literally

5016.11 --> 5021.389999999999
engineer their own memories in the spot

5018.63 --> 5024.51
in order to prevent the data from

5021.39 --> 5026.700000000001
sinking in and all that so the the

5024.51 --> 5030.51
actual debate is much much more about

5026.7 --> 5034.45
just pure psychology that's what it is

5030.51 --> 5037.97
now it's pure pure psychology oh oh

5034.45 --> 5040.55
even well Orwell wrote even the cycle up

5037.97 --> 5043.97
to the level psychology in like how does

5040.55 --> 5046.04
information reach people in their minds

5043.97 --> 5049.6
it's more about that than the actual

5046.04 --> 5053.33
yeah facts because it's been just

5049.6 --> 5055.700000000001
displayed with with no end well I think

5053.33 --> 5060.0199999999995
how Orwell said he said reality is in

5055.7 --> 5067.22
the skull you know what reality is

5060.02 --> 5068.870000000001
inside the skull hmm all right you know

5067.22 --> 5070.46
that's why I like the only this is what

5068.87 --> 5073.43
guess what kind of this is what always

5070.46 --> 5077.87
allowed for me to defend the globus in

5073.43 --> 5082.91
my opinion a because I'm a [ __ ] proud

5077.87 --> 5084.7699999999995
American and B because there really is

5082.91 --> 5087.7699999999995
like you know alternative arguments

5084.77 --> 5091.040000000001
should be made like the only you know

5087.77 --> 5098.540000000001
the only deal would still on you know

5091.04 --> 5101.39
the only oh my god you know I'm trying

5098.54 --> 5103.4
to think of the word sub the only the

5101.39 --> 5105.97
only thing we can objectively agree on

5103.4 --> 5113.24
is that we experience the world

5105.97 --> 5114.860000000001
subjectively right and I think you could

5113.24 --> 5121.91
boil that down to potentially being

5114.86 --> 5125.389999999999
solipsistic well I don't think

5121.91 --> 5127.01
necessarily that well I'm sort of like

5125.39 --> 5130.280000000001
exactly well how do you know how do you

5127.01 --> 5135.2300000000005
know that everyone observes the world

5130.28 --> 5139.07
subjectively no no I think the mind can

5135.23 --> 5141.5
have a model of what the person thinks

5139.07 --> 5144.23
reality is and that debt is a

5141.5 --> 5146.0
perspective somatically circuited what I

5144.23 --> 5149.929999999999
think that our conscious experience is

5146.0 --> 5153.49
very similar oh where do you say where

5149.93 --> 5155.780000000001
do you live where do you live right here

5153.49 --> 5162.5199999999995
right would you say that you live like

5155.78 --> 5164.9
in your body let's say mmm partially I

5162.52 --> 5167.490000000001
mean you don't experience the world

5164.9 --> 5171.57
through your body

5167.49 --> 5176.25
not all of it no well I would dare say

5171.57 --> 5179.07
that that is delusional I'm because I

5176.25 --> 5181.02
love in dreams and that's definitely not

5179.07 --> 5183.2699999999995
using my regular senses

5181.02 --> 5185.67
no nobody even even then you're

5183.27 --> 5187.620000000001
experiencing that through your your body

5185.67 --> 5189.84
though like that would be your treat or

5187.62 --> 5191.82
your dreams like you know well I mean I

5189.84 --> 5193.77
mean don't know it's my body the only

5191.82 --> 5195.96
thing about my body that is involved in

5193.77 --> 5198.96
that is that it is a receiver for me to

5195.96 --> 5201.36
eventually have to reflect upon an

5198.96 --> 5206.76
experience but that experience was not

5201.36 --> 5208.62
created by my physical sensory okay a

5206.76 --> 5211.62
new gland problem but let's say we're

5208.62 --> 5214.14
standing at the beach right and you see

5211.62 --> 5216.09
the Sun across the way and I see the Sun

5214.14 --> 5218.490000000001
rising you know rising up right

5216.09 --> 5225.78
what can you look at the Sun through my

5218.49 --> 5229.08
eyes and physically no rights because am

5225.78 --> 5230.73
i spiritually comes after physically

5229.08 --> 5232.7699999999995
though right you have to have a body if

5230.73 --> 5236.9
you're gonna have a spirit right to

5232.77 --> 5238.410000000001
house the spirit no experience okay

5236.9 --> 5240.75
where's the body

5238.41 --> 5242.55
is this gonna be the word the word lady

5240.75 --> 5244.92
is the throne of the spirit not the

5242.55 --> 5247.95
other way around the word was with the

5244.92 --> 5250.2
Lord I hold on so here at first body

5247.95 --> 5251.94
second that's how okay right okay so

5250.2 --> 5254.28
back to the sunset the point is that

5251.94 --> 5256.2
we're experiencing this world and you

5254.28 --> 5258.599999999999
can't look through my eyes to see the

5256.2 --> 5260.58
Sun I can safely say the only way you

5258.6 --> 5262.530000000001
can [ __ ] see to your son is through

5260.58 --> 5264.78
your eyes so what I'm trying to say is

5262.53 --> 5266.639999999999
that it's the the you know I'm being

5264.78 --> 5268.71
that I experienced the world through my

5266.64 --> 5270.72
I would see the Sun through my eyes and

5268.71 --> 5274.5
you're seeing the sense of your eyes the

5270.72 --> 5276.81
only objective reality is that I am

5274.5 --> 5280.47
having a subjective experience with the

5276.81 --> 5284.31
Sun now I might see curvature you might

5280.47 --> 5286.83
not and so in that way I cannot say to

5284.31 --> 5288.6
somebody that you're not allowed you

5286.83 --> 5290.22
know that you don't see curvature I

5288.6 --> 5293.400000000001
can't say that to somebody thing you

5290.22 --> 5297.360000000001
don't see it because I have to

5293.4 --> 5300.48
appreciate the you know what I consider

5297.36 --> 5301.29
to be like you know a collective reality

5300.48 --> 5302.4
that you know

5301.29 --> 5307.89
you're experiencing the world through

5302.4 --> 5309.299999999999
your set of sensors you know and that's

5307.89 --> 5314.87
all I'm saying it's like you can't

5309.3 --> 5317.7300000000005
really judge somebody in certain things

5314.87 --> 5319.26
because of what they experience because

5317.73 --> 5322.44
of because of it you know

5319.26 --> 5324.39
I mean certain things you know I mean

5322.44 --> 5325.41
yes you can't judge [ __ ] you know

5324.39 --> 5328.05
certain people should be put to death

5325.41 --> 5329.88
for certain [ __ ] things but you know

5328.05 --> 5331.05
violations of [ __ ] ethics and

5329.88 --> 5332.91
morality and she'll like that but

5331.05 --> 5334.2300000000005
ultimately when it comes down to whether

5332.91 --> 5337.05
you're gonna see the curve or not

5334.23 --> 5339.69
there's no reason for division because

5337.05 --> 5341.070000000001
we can all [ __ ] all day and that's

5339.69 --> 5342.66
what's so nice and like I was getting to

5341.07 --> 5344.07
earlier is like I'm so proud of this

5342.66 --> 5345.69
discussion having come to the point

5344.07 --> 5348.21
where I was on a rant ease the other

5345.69 --> 5350.8099999999995
night and gem panda was saying how you

5348.21 --> 5353.1
know he recognizes that he believes

5350.81 --> 5354.6900000000005
these things too and maybe he's always

5353.1 --> 5357.2300000000005
had that position I don't know but it

5354.69 --> 5360.21
was just it's nice to hear it because

5357.23 --> 5362.549999999999
you know it's okay for it to be a belief

5360.21 --> 5365.16
it's okay for the globe to be a belief

5362.55 --> 5369.18
you know it's also okay that Flat Earth

5365.16 --> 5370.83
is a belief you know and that's where

5369.18 --> 5378.81
like you know and once we can come in we

5370.83 --> 5381.0599999999995
can manage these Congress yeah okay we

5378.81 --> 5387.0
can go there need some moment look you

5381.06 --> 5389.81
do this because nobody right johnandrich

5387.0 --> 5400.02
orientation of the Earth's surface it is

5389.81 --> 5403.080000000001
if you're gonna say the earth not is not

5400.02 --> 5410.280000000001
the shape geometrical orientation of the

5403.08 --> 5413.34
Earth's surface is flat I said it well

5410.28 --> 5414.96
how come there's Hills that because it

5413.34 --> 5416.46
has nothing to do with the geometrical

5414.96 --> 5419.55
orientation of the Earth's surface

5416.46 --> 5423.54
that's the topography of the houses have

5419.55 --> 5424.41
you seen the earth in total as much of

5423.54 --> 5428.94
it as I could

5424.41 --> 5431.34
is that enough it's enough to draw

5428.94 --> 5434.94
geometrical conclusions definitely right

5431.34 --> 5438.33
okay so you would say like a belief No

5434.94 --> 5440.699
a geometrical orientation see but then

5438.33 --> 5445.4
you'll be a delusion no it's not you

5440.699 --> 5447.69
find an aspect of reality empirically

5445.4 --> 5450.33
refine it and then you have the

5447.69 --> 5452.46
conclusion it is this this is what I've

5450.33 --> 5454.67
deduced from my perceptions within

5452.46 --> 5457.65
reality and figuring it out empirically

5454.67 --> 5459.36
right so if you get like orientation of

5457.65 --> 5461.91
a surface is flat

5459.36 --> 5465.719
okay well see here's the thing it's like

5461.91 --> 5468.66
I with you but I recognize that it's a

5465.719 --> 5471.18
belief no it's not and if you can't

5468.66 --> 5474.0
recognize it's not it's in this erekle

5471.18 --> 5475.650000000001
okay you sound just like a NASA [ __ ]

5474.0 --> 5478.44
scientist trying to tell me that we went

5475.65 --> 5481.469
to the moon did no I don't yeah you do

5478.44 --> 5485.46
empiricism actually doing it yourself

5481.469 --> 5487.5
here all the appearances I know you

5485.46 --> 5490.86
can't accept it look it's a [ __ ]

5487.5 --> 5494.13
belief yeah and if you're not gonna put

5490.86 --> 5496.049999999999
that [ __ ] word down my throat ISA

5494.13 --> 5499.9800000000005
then you're with the wrong person here

5496.05 --> 5504.3
it's not ability I just I don't believe

5499.98 --> 5506.549999999999
things concerning cosmogony because that

5504.3 --> 5509.070000000001
is your Luxury but I can't afford with

5506.55 --> 5511.2300000000005
what I do know I might presuppose things

5509.07 --> 5514.59
in points but I'm not gonna stick to any

5511.23 --> 5520.86
belief except for that so Jess you

5514.59 --> 5522.78
played a totally come certain off dude

5520.86 --> 5524.219
so you pretty suppose that the earth is

5522.78 --> 5526.0199999999995
flat but you're not gonna say that

5524.219 --> 5528.87
that's a belief right I'm not

5526.02 --> 5532.530000000001
presupposing the earth is flat you're

5528.87 --> 5536.07
saying it is no no again you're being a

5532.53 --> 5540.03
baller right now you're you're literally

5536.07 --> 5543.7699999999995
misquoting me and was very class you

5540.03 --> 5546.96
know exactly why I was very specific I

5543.77 --> 5549.18
don't know leaving or presupposing the

5546.96 --> 5552.57
earth is flat no no no I've empirically

5549.18 --> 5555.84
deduced and have great certainty of my

5552.57 --> 5558.15
emperess empiric research in it that the

5555.84 --> 5562.56
geometrical orientation of the earth

5558.15 --> 5564.54
surface is flat straight low down level

5562.56 --> 5567.05
no doubt no doubt right then don't

5564.54 --> 5569.69
misquote me please

5567.05 --> 5572.570000000001
do you have no doubt about that yes I

5569.69 --> 5576.32
don't okay cool so you're like a [ __ ]

5572.57 --> 5580.099999999999
Nazi then sure if that's what you want

5576.32 --> 5582.08
yes I see because I am certain that the

5580.1 --> 5584.570000000001
geometrical orientation of the Earth's

5582.08 --> 5585.71
surface is flat but you haven't seen a

5584.57 --> 5595.13
whole picture of it you don't really

5585.71 --> 5599.53
know you're just yeah yeah that that's

5595.13 --> 5599.53
the last time I'm doing that with you

5606.13 --> 5613.72
ya know he said if you're gonna be like

5611.62 --> 5620.23
that then you can [ __ ] off and never

5613.72 --> 5623.38
come back I don't believe anything I've

5620.23 --> 5625.87
empirically deduced the geometrical

5623.38 --> 5630.58
orientation of the Earth's surface to be

5625.87 --> 5632.5
flat with absolute certainty irrevocable

5630.58 --> 5634.09
certainty and if that makes me a NASA

5632.5 --> 5636.18
that come and execute me you piece of

5634.09 --> 5640.39
[ __ ]

5636.18 --> 5640.96
scumbag how dare you [ __ ] equate me

5640.39 --> 5655.6900000000005
with that

5640.96 --> 5660.12
[ __ ] you ISA [ __ ] you yeah and I want a

5655.69 --> 5660.12
[ __ ] apology big time

5664.31 --> 5669.63
you're not playing around like that with

5666.78 --> 5672.24
me you know you can do that [ __ ] on your

5669.63 --> 5675.33
own show but you don't [ __ ] call me a

5672.24 --> 5677.4
freakin Nazi over having absolute

5675.33 --> 5679.95
certainty about the geometrical

5677.4 --> 5683.879999999999
orientation of the earth realm now you

5679.95 --> 5689.389999999999
don't get it you don't get it bro you

5683.88 --> 5701.61
don't freaking call me that you don't

5689.39 --> 5703.83
take care yeah I will take care take

5701.61 --> 5706.83
care a lot Issa good luck with that

5703.83 --> 5711.15
calling people Nazis for no frickin good

5706.83 --> 5713.04
reason take care of yourself if you

5711.15 --> 5716.759999999999
don't like Flat Earth anymore then just

5713.04 --> 5720.48
[ __ ] off if you don't if you can't

5716.76 --> 5723.4800000000005
handle a person having certainty about a

5720.48 --> 5727.169999999999
specific thing and backing that up then

5723.48 --> 5736.44
just [ __ ] off man we don't need you

5727.17 --> 5741.56
anymore if you're gonna be like that or

5736.44 --> 5744.419999999999
you could just take it easy buddy and

5741.56 --> 5747.860000000001
just retract for a while until you get

5744.42 --> 5747.86
back to your freakin senses

5754.5 --> 5759.83
[Music]

5757.33 --> 5762.71
don't ever do that again ever

5759.83 --> 5766.37
or you are not welcome over at my

5762.71 --> 5769.27
digital place anymore is that clear and

5766.37 --> 5772.96
I don't care what you feel about that

5769.27 --> 5772.96
that's the rule

5784.55 --> 5791.75
all right well I don't care about faith

5788.33 --> 5794.33
at it I don't have faith I just the

5791.75 --> 5797.54
preponderance of everything that I

5794.33 --> 5802.67
figured out I trust my senses I trust

5797.54 --> 5805.19
the entirety of my experience I trust my

5802.67 --> 5808.22
faculties I've trust the mistakes I've

5805.19 --> 5811.849999999999
made I trust that I haven't figured out

5808.22 --> 5814.04
every mistake I made so far yet but what

5811.85 --> 5817.43
I also trust is there will be no more

5814.04 --> 5821.26
point in my life ever where I will

5817.43 --> 5826.88
backtrack saying no I have absolute 100%

5821.26 --> 5829.55
empirically based deduced certainty that

5826.88 --> 5831.8
the geometry Oh metrical orientation of

5829.55 --> 5835.46
the Earth's surface is flat and you

5831.8 --> 5836.24
don't freaking call people a Nazi over

5835.46 --> 5842.2300000000005
that ever

5836.24 --> 5842.23
Iza get a freakin grip man

5851.6 --> 5854.72
all right

5855.57 --> 5862.3099999999995
Wow that was Sarah bummer didn't expect

5859.68 --> 5869.39
him that he would do anything about that

5862.31 --> 5871.620000000001
anything like that that's that's okay

5869.39 --> 5874.68
this kind of thing happened before I

5871.62 --> 5882.15
know what went on but yeah that certain

5874.68 --> 5884.76
things you don't do right because in my

5882.15 --> 5889.11
opinion even calling people Nazis at

5884.76 --> 5892.4400000000005
this point is you know it already plays

5889.11 --> 5894.32
into a false image that has been abused

5892.44 --> 5899.28
to know and I find the whole thing

5894.32 --> 5906.929999999999
highly highly repulsive it's only one

5899.28 --> 5909.98
type that calls people's Nazis and those

5906.93 --> 5909.9800000000005
are not friends of mine

5923.36 --> 5929.99
all right

5926.06 --> 5934.4800000000005
ah well I don't know how to recover from

5929.99 --> 5937.28
that mood is certainly ruined right now

5934.48 --> 5939.86
it's weird because I actually got called

5937.28 --> 5941.63
up by my healer who interrupted by show

5939.86 --> 5944.509999999999
like twice while that happened so I

5941.63 --> 5947.42
can't really explain that's put together

5944.51 --> 5957.59
but I'm gonna call him back after I end

5947.42 --> 5962.06
the show uh no guns I've never I think

5957.59 --> 5965.54
Issa is neutral he really is but he just

5962.06 --> 5966.740000000001
went a step too far and it was very very

5965.54 --> 5972.38
upfront about it

5966.74 --> 5976.219999999999
yes healer a person for vast majority of

5972.38 --> 5980.75
their life the most confident spiritual

5976.22 --> 5983.05
people I've ever met in person that's

5980.75 --> 5983.05
right

5988.24 --> 5992.42
thankfully and familiar with this guy

5990.26 --> 5995.39
well Robin Stanley look Issa is pretty

5992.42 --> 5997.7300000000005
cool well I thought so at least he just

5995.39 --> 6001.660000000001
went a little not too far he thought it

5997.73 --> 6005.259999999999
was funny to do that probably because

6001.66 --> 6009.76
it's just used to people that do that

6005.26 --> 6012.13
[ __ ] I do not accept it I get livid when

6009.76 --> 6018.820000000001
people do that [ __ ] especially when they

6012.13 --> 6023.4400000000005
dare dare for whatever [ __ ] reason to

6018.82 --> 6028.41
use peer pressure like that on me nobody

6023.44 --> 6028.41
does that no body ever

6032.25 --> 6037.6
but yeah ISA has been around for a long

6035.29 --> 6039.61
time he is kind of like a legal expert

6037.6 --> 6041.320000000001
he knows a lot about sovereignty and

6039.61 --> 6042.7
about how to get around in the legal

6041.32 --> 6047.11
system and hey it's some pretty

6042.7 --> 6050.889999999999
interesting insights on that but then he

6047.11 --> 6054.79
just went just overboard with this whole

6050.89 --> 6057.610000000001
stupid trying to peer pressure me out of

6054.79 --> 6059.38
having out of claiming certainty about

6057.61 --> 6063.67
the geometric orientation of the earth

6059.38 --> 6065.5
and misquoting me on the spots baller

6063.67 --> 6067.06
behavior baller tactics and

6065.5 --> 6072.51
psychological approach that is

6067.06 --> 6072.51
absolutely unacceptable unacceptable

6080.09 --> 6090.14
yeah okay oh [ __ ] you then Issa never

6083.87 --> 6093.28
come back ever ever [ __ ] off why don't

6090.14 --> 6093.280000000001
you go and join aunt Eva

6096.739 --> 6101.45
yeah he's always follow that I don't

6099.95 --> 6110.12
care about that you know it's it's a

6101.45 --> 6115.429999999999
minor nuisance he's doing [ __ ] you go

6110.12 --> 6117.92
and join the globe ease they think like

6115.43 --> 6121.27
that too that's their methodology their

6117.92 --> 6121.27
social way of doing things

6146.15 --> 6149.62
yeah yeah

6155.82 --> 6162.84
now he's not gonna do it hey Jim no no I

6160.53 --> 6166.95
think ISA is just okay with burning

6162.84 --> 6168.900000000001
bridges he doesn't really like my

6166.95 --> 6172.679999999999
general attitude anyway because I'm not

6168.9 --> 6178.53
chill enough I have too much spice in my

6172.68 --> 6181.83
attitude towards things out there he

6178.53 --> 6182.28
doesn't like that I think I don't know

6181.83 --> 6184.32
man

6182.28 --> 6187.98
I just know that what he's doing right

6184.32 --> 6190.139999999999
now is he's I don't know if he even

6187.98 --> 6194.759999999999
realizes that with that last statement

6190.14 --> 6197.67
he is basically calling everyone in this

6194.76 --> 6198.45
chat most people here a little fascist

6197.67 --> 6201.51
bro

6198.45 --> 6204.63
it's literally calling you that I don't

6201.51 --> 6208.7
know if he even realizes it that that's

6204.63 --> 6211.77
his position now he let that slip out

6208.7 --> 6216.92
it's either some really bad emotional

6211.77 --> 6216.92
control on your part or you're just gone

6219.56 --> 6222.56
right

6236.289 --> 6240.48
right

6238.05 --> 6242.37
but yeah I don't even care I I don't

6240.48 --> 6245.129999999999
even care at this point what he was even

6242.37 --> 6247.08
trying to do like he's a shapeless

6245.13 --> 6249.51
earther or something is this his new

6247.08 --> 6252.74
thing there the earth has no shape it's

6249.51 --> 6255.900000000001
a shapeless earth is that his new thing

6252.74 --> 6259.41
q and on earth the shapeless realm the

6255.9 --> 6261.78
simulation the absolutely anything but

6259.41 --> 6266.599999999999
reminding people that the geometrical

6261.78 --> 6273.75
orientation of the earth's surface is

6266.6 --> 6279.030000000001
absolutely flat and level if that is not

6273.75 --> 6281.31
attainable then yeah I don't know what

6279.03 --> 6283.139999999999
you're doing here anymore you know and I

6281.31 --> 6285.330000000001
go and go and create the shapeless Earth

6283.14 --> 6287.9400000000005
Society or something you know go ahead I

6285.33 --> 6290.49
don't care I'm pretty damn sure that

6287.94 --> 6292.95
whatever the realm and preponderance is

6290.49 --> 6295.679999999999
because I don't know a lot about it what

6292.95 --> 6297.929999999999
I do know is that geometrical

6295.68 --> 6300.450000000001
orientation of the surface and you could

6297.93 --> 6303.4800000000005
even say at this point layers the

6300.45 --> 6306.69
virtual layers of the whole content of

6303.48 --> 6310.19
the realm is absolutely geometrically

6306.69 --> 6313.82
flat and that's a fact

6310.19 --> 6316.83
empirically deducible fact to no end

6313.82 --> 6322.799999999999
without any evidence to prove the

6316.83 --> 6324.69
contrary so yeah that doesn't mean that

6322.8 --> 6327.12
I know everything about what the earth

6324.69 --> 6331.29
is like or they definitely know those

6327.12 --> 6332.93
factors definitely do that and I can

6331.29 --> 6335.91
work with that

6332.93 --> 6339.02
plenty

6335.91 --> 6339.0199999999995
[Music]

6349.77 --> 6353.5
whatever he says gonna do he's

6352.0 --> 6355.52
definitely doesn't have to come back

6353.5 --> 6358.699
here for a while

6355.52 --> 6358.6990000000005
[Music]

6370.719 --> 6377.44
right anyway that's not exactly how I

6374.13 --> 6379.9890000000005
thought the Saturday show would go but

6377.44 --> 6387.58
it is what it is I am gonna round it out

6379.989 --> 6390.61
now I'm steadfast in my beliefs yeah

6387.58 --> 6393.76
well no there are certain things you

6390.61 --> 6396.339999999999
just know things that don't change that

6393.76 --> 6398.38
you figure it out and there is no reason

6396.34 --> 6400.78
to believe whatsoever that it would even

6398.38 --> 6403.21
be possible that anything about those

6400.78 --> 6405.489
things would change and one of those is

6403.21 --> 6409.81
the geometrical orientation of the realm

6405.489 --> 6411.599999999999
and that's just one little aspect you

6409.81 --> 6417.219
know because it doesn't even mean that

6411.6 --> 6419.4400000000005
the content or the lateral orientation

6417.219 --> 6421.75
the interconnecting orientation of the

6419.44 --> 6424.8099999999995
realm could not even potentially change

6421.75 --> 6428.52
in some way or be extremely surreal not

6424.81 --> 6431.610000000001
linear but when it comes to the surface

6428.52 --> 6433.75
orientation that aspect is definitely

6431.61 --> 6437.7699999999995
flat and straight that's just

6433.75 --> 6441.13
unmistakable yeah and it then might get

6437.77 --> 6443.5
kind of surreal from that point on but

6441.13 --> 6446.1900000000005
that's just the way it is that is what

6443.5 --> 6450.58
has been determined to be out there so

6446.19 --> 6453.429999999999
yeah if you can't handle that then you

6450.58 --> 6455.5
can't just start saying beliefs and your

6453.43 --> 6463.51
being a fascist or something that that's

6455.5 --> 6465.61
insane I don't get it anyway thanks

6463.51 --> 6467.05
everyone for coming I hope you like this

6465.61 --> 6470.349999999999
show was a little bit over the place

6467.05 --> 6472.93
mention at the end there if you did then

6470.35 --> 6474.64
please don't forget to Rogen's it up and

6472.93 --> 6476.29
if you haven't already subscribed to my

6474.64 --> 6478.09
channel and hit the bell notification so

6476.29 --> 6480.04
you know when I'm going live just

6478.09 --> 6480.219
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

6480.04 --> 6482.53
day

6480.219 --> 6485.14
please also do support me through the

6482.53 --> 6487.09
paypal patreon the super chat and the

6485.14 --> 6489.43
membership system joined button that we

6487.09 --> 6492.6990000000005
much appreciated and thanks for the

6489.43 --> 6496.42
support today many young and maybe

6492.699 --> 6498.82
others I don't know and for all so yeah

6496.42 --> 6501.75
the support is just a very unexpected

6498.82 --> 6501.75
situation for me

6502.789 --> 6509.239
all right what's that guns if never

6505.19 --> 6514.449
around you have to check out PayPal I'll

6509.239 --> 6514.449
do that before I finalize the show ah

6515.92 --> 6521.179
right

6517.159 --> 6525.53
later probably right it's okay uh right

6521.179 --> 6525.7390000000005
so um mmm I'll be back tomorrow Flat
