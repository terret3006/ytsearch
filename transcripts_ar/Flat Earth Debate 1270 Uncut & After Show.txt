conversation that hopefully develops

130.64 --> 136.23899999999998
well i said for today's live show

134.0 --> 138.08
i kept talking if he would have kept

136.239 --> 140.239
talking he would have done himself more

138.08 --> 141.76000000000002
damage

140.239 --> 143.52
yeah he just came out of the blue and

141.76 --> 145.28
started telling me i'm talking about

143.52 --> 149.04000000000002
equilibrium and uh

145.28 --> 150.319
all this nonsense they just need to

149.04 --> 152.319
assert that

150.319 --> 154.79999999999998
you know look outside there's gas pushed

152.319 --> 158.39999999999998
without a container

154.8 --> 161.59900000000002
yeah you know i even showed it now with

158.4 --> 164.48000000000002
my summary with photos and stuff just to

161.599 --> 164.48
shove it in his face

166.879 --> 173.92
what an idiot yeah

170.239 --> 173.92000000000002
hey tim good morning

174.16 --> 180.64
what's happening oh i had a good day

177.76 --> 180.64
golf yesterday

183.599 --> 187.11999999999998
coffee is nice and relaxing oh that's

186.319 --> 189.11999999999998
great

187.12 --> 191.36
i've never played a game of golf in my

189.12 --> 192.56
life but the first time i teed up the

191.36 --> 194.64000000000001
ball and hit it

192.56 --> 199.84
it went far and then i couldn't hit it

194.64 --> 199.83999999999997
again for the life of me

206.0 --> 213.84
yeah most of the golfers enjoy the ninth

208.08 --> 215.92000000000002
the 18th of the 19th hold faced

213.84 --> 219.599
no the best part of golf is when you

215.92 --> 222.48
first start because you're even parked

219.599 --> 223.67999999999998
my cousin my cousin tells me he's a

222.48 --> 224.879
baseball player

223.68 --> 227.84
you know he's been trying to break it

224.879 --> 230.39999999999998
into hollywood for years he's done some

227.84 --> 231.599
movies and stuff like that and he tells

230.4 --> 235.76000000000002
me neil

231.599 --> 235.76
if god was to play a game it would be

238.84 --> 242.239
golf

240.0 --> 243.599
i remember when i was playing um club

242.239 --> 245.28
club golf

243.599 --> 247.83999999999997
the guys the first nine holes they would

245.28 --> 249.599
play rubbish then they get halfway out

247.84 --> 250.959
and they they drink and all of a sudden

249.599 --> 253.76
the drunk cars and they just

250.959 --> 254.0
hit straight like the superpower is

253.76 --> 257.84
being

254.0 --> 261.44
drunk no that's not it

257.84 --> 262.479
uh the problem with what what you're

261.44 --> 269.6
observing

262.479 --> 271.97999999999996
let me ask you was this a scientific

269.6 --> 274.16
what was your dependent variable

271.98 --> 276.96000000000004
[Laughter]

274.16 --> 278.47900000000004
so what's what's that so what's that let

276.96 --> 280.23999999999995
me

278.479 --> 281.59999999999997
well let me answer what i think what he

280.24 --> 283.759
was saying

281.6 --> 285.44
they're so into control in the first

283.759 --> 288.0
nine where they're interfering

285.44 --> 289.36
with golf and they finally stop trying

288.0 --> 292.32
to control it

289.36 --> 294.56
so it gets much better when you just

292.32 --> 294.56
play

295.12 --> 297.84000000000003
yep

300.0 --> 306.639
they're just more more relaxed i guess

304.24 --> 307.84000000000003
well that's one way i guess of saying

306.639 --> 310.24
you're not thinking

307.84 --> 311.039
because you're relaxed because you're

310.24 --> 313.039
not thinking

311.039 --> 317.28
you can't think and play at the same

313.039 --> 317.28
time it doesn't work out well

319.44 --> 322.88
now when i say think i'm not saying

321.759 --> 325.84000000000003
strategy or

322.88 --> 326.88
which club to pick and how hard you

325.84 --> 328.71999999999997
swing or

326.88 --> 330.8
if you hold back on the club because you

328.72 --> 334.32000000000005
know you've got different lengths

330.8 --> 337.52000000000004
on the club right you can hit a 7-iron

334.32 --> 340.88
say 160 or 165

337.52 --> 342.32
or 150 depending on person and then you

340.88 --> 343.759
could swing a little easier and just

342.32 --> 347.039
make it go 120

343.759 --> 350.24
but that's a big club to do that with

347.039 --> 350.24
but people have that skill

351.36 --> 355.36
you're saying you're saying tap into

353.44 --> 357.919
what you already know

355.36 --> 358.639
and what you've already been doing right

357.919 --> 361.35999999999996
yeah

358.639 --> 362.08
so like the way you drive your car huh

361.36 --> 364.08000000000004
exactly

362.08 --> 365.28
sometimes i get home and i'm like how

364.08 --> 367.75899999999996
the heck did i get here

365.28 --> 368.479
i didn't even drop them like you know

367.759 --> 369.759
what i'm saying

368.479 --> 372.31899999999996
you get home and you're like wow how did

369.759 --> 373.6
i get here i was daydreaming the whole

372.319 --> 377.36
time

373.6 --> 378.88
you were parallel processing nail

377.36 --> 381.36
so what's that pitch input because i

378.88 --> 382.71999999999997
used to work with a lot of irish guys

381.36 --> 384.72
you know and they they couldn't wait to

382.72 --> 387.68
the weekend to go play pitch and putt

384.72 --> 387.68
what the heck is that

388.96 --> 392.88
i don't know how the irish would

390.96 --> 394.96
describe it

392.88 --> 396.319
but yeah i think all it is is you're

394.96 --> 397.12
just pitching to the green and then

396.319 --> 400.8
putting

397.12 --> 402.8
you're not playing the actual gold yeah

400.8 --> 409.84000000000003
yeah there's a term and golf pitch shot

402.8 --> 409.84000000000003
so it could be just that yeah

410.24 --> 415.36
so i don't even know what what a larger

412.24 --> 418.319
version of golf is so i was lost

415.36 --> 419.599
probably from the tee box with a driver

418.319 --> 421.68
they get rid of that

419.599 --> 423.12
your mid iron shots get rid of that and

421.68 --> 424.96
just go around the green and you just

423.12 --> 429.36
pitch it on the butt

424.96 --> 433.28
okay yeah you even get uh

429.36 --> 434.88
sorry no finish up i was just gonna

433.28 --> 437.84
say give me a recap of yesterday's show

434.88 --> 437.84
what happened

439.199 --> 444.319
i don't think um i don't think what's

441.199 --> 444.319
his name came on again

445.599 --> 450.639
i don't think ed came on it was kind of

447.44 --> 453.36
laid back then um

450.639 --> 455.199
after show so so you gave me a recap of

453.36 --> 456.72
what didn't happen how about a recap of

455.199 --> 459.199
what did happen

456.72 --> 461.52000000000004
or when that owen had a mouth down again

459.199 --> 465.36
yeah i wanted a little meltdown

461.52 --> 468.479
did they end well he came back here

465.36 --> 473.12
in the after show he came back in okay

468.479 --> 475.28
that's fine yeah that's that's not true

473.12 --> 476.879
no no no no that's not true what

475.28 --> 477.75899999999996
actually happened was arwen reached the

476.879 --> 480.639
point where

477.759 --> 481.36
had he have not left he may have had a

480.639 --> 483.36
meltdown

481.36 --> 485.039
instead he chose to leave very very

483.36 --> 488.08000000000004
sensible he didn't have a meltdown

485.039 --> 488.08
that's just simply not true

498.24 --> 501.84000000000003
just to rephrase what did happen arwen

500.08 --> 505.919
fought his position

501.84 --> 507.35999999999996
and to be brutally honest didn't do well

505.919 --> 507.68
he was trying to defend a position that

507.36 --> 509.599
was

507.68 --> 511.199
utilizing reification and just

509.599 --> 512.8
justifying why he couldn't map out the

511.199 --> 514.479
land below while simultaneously saying

512.8 --> 516.3199999999999
he was going to map out the land below

514.479 --> 518.24
or with very cleverly beautifully

516.32 --> 519.44
phrased poetry

518.24 --> 520.64
but ultimately you know once pulled

519.44 --> 521.519
apart it's no different to any of the

520.64 --> 523.68
heliocentric

521.519 --> 525.12
or otherwise reification fallacy and

523.68 --> 526.4799999999999
owens is no different to any other model

525.12 --> 527.2
so it just got pulled apart in the same

526.48 --> 528.72
fashion

527.2 --> 530.48
it needed to be done otherwise i'd be

528.72 --> 532.399
seen as uh like

530.48 --> 533.9200000000001
favorable with other people's fantasy

532.399 --> 534.88
models like arwyn it's like no i'm not

533.92 --> 536.0
going to stand for that i don't care if

534.88 --> 537.4399999999999
it's arwin or not

536.0 --> 539.279
however he's never going to defend that

537.44 --> 540.48
[ __ ] and all the peppering it with

539.279 --> 545.6
yes he knows it's

540.48 --> 548.0
uh what was the word he used i remember

545.6 --> 549.6
conceptual kept on calling it conceptual

548.0 --> 551.36
well peppering it with the

549.6 --> 552.8000000000001
the justification that it's conceptual

551.36 --> 554.48
isn't going to defend it

552.8 --> 556.0799999999999
so you know and at the point that it's

554.48 --> 558.8000000000001
like i'm going to lose my temper now

556.08 --> 562.8000000000001
your life he left so you know i don't

558.8 --> 564.3199999999999
think that are we not in any way

562.8 --> 565.5999999999999
yeah but he was losing it when he

564.32 --> 566.9590000000001
started telling me too relevant the

565.6 --> 569.6800000000001
whole time

566.959 --> 571.279
starting to lose it maybe but that's

569.68 --> 575.5999999999999
when he buggered off good for him

571.279 --> 578.0
very very sensible yeah yeah let's see

575.6 --> 578.72
what was he was he playing the baller

578.0 --> 581.68
position

578.72 --> 583.2
uh kind of like his uh little joke out

581.68 --> 584.64
there about getting paid six million

583.2 --> 585.36
dollars to help them out kind of that

584.64 --> 588.16
position

585.36 --> 589.519
no he was he was he was obviously

588.16 --> 591.36
defending something that was personal to

589.519 --> 593.12
him hence the reason that he got

591.36 --> 595.279
emotionally attached to it and therefore

593.12 --> 597.04
frustrated and eventually left as a

595.279 --> 599.2
result rather than becoming

597.04 --> 600.399
you know triggered or what everyone else

599.2 --> 602.0
wants to call he just defended his

600.399 --> 603.36
position until it was undefendable then

602.0 --> 606.399
left rather than getting annoyed because

603.36 --> 606.399
it's something personal to him

611.92 --> 618.079
don't insult his intelligence nathan and

614.32 --> 619.7600000000001
insult your intelligence

618.079 --> 621.76
arwin said that yeah sorry i thought you

619.76 --> 623.6
were saying that to me yeah that's

621.76 --> 625.12
that that was the point that arvin was

623.6 --> 629.9200000000001
starting to take it personally

625.12 --> 629.92
and that was two minutes before he left

643.12 --> 646.9590000000001
nothing else happened yesterday besides

645.2 --> 649.6800000000001
that

646.959 --> 649.68
um

652.32 --> 655.519
i don't know i haven't had a chance to

654.0 --> 657.76
i'd normally at this point

655.519 --> 659.6
i'd have watched the pre and after show

657.76 --> 661.8389999999999
from yesterday back once

659.6 --> 663.36
however because it it gets released on

661.839 --> 665.519
saturday

663.36 --> 667.76
i tend to not so come thursday friday

665.519 --> 669.2
the shows get delayed today

667.76 --> 670.8
that's the staggered day that's put in

669.2 --> 672.32
on monday so they end up

670.8 --> 674.079
being delayed two days for those who

672.32 --> 675.12
aren't members if you remember you get

674.079 --> 676.56
it straight away

675.12 --> 677.68
um which is still the case i could have

676.56 --> 679.3599999999999
gone and watched the members video i

677.68 --> 681.76
just didn't have chance

679.36 --> 685.04
i was busy so i don't know what happened

681.76 --> 685.04
on yesterday's show and i can't remember

685.2 --> 689.0400000000001
it was a very laid-back show

693.6 --> 697.6
let's get it going with the topic so we

695.6 --> 700.48
hear this all the time from uh

697.6 --> 702.0790000000001
the ballers and even from people who

700.48 --> 704.64
have heard it themselves just repeat

702.079 --> 707.04
it the science is settled when someone

704.64 --> 710.16
says the science is settled

707.04 --> 713.4399999999999
uh obviously it's uh

710.16 --> 715.12
they're trying to say that the very

713.44 --> 719.0400000000001
thing that they're presenting

715.12 --> 720.88
is valid truth uh unquestionable

719.04 --> 722.56
the signs are settled this is it and

720.88 --> 724.0
they use it with gravity they use it

722.56 --> 726.079
everything else and then we say well

724.0 --> 728.16
show it show it to us show us the

726.079 --> 729.68
scientific method show us the process

728.16 --> 731.519
you went to show us the dependent

729.68 --> 733.279
variable independent variable

731.519 --> 734.5600000000001
and all of a sudden the science doesn't

733.279 --> 736.32
look so settled

734.56 --> 738.2399999999999
because it comes unraveling apart does

736.32 --> 740.0790000000001
it not

738.24 --> 741.6
it reminds me of the debate i had last

740.079 --> 746.16
night with negato

741.6 --> 746.16
exactly the same what happened

746.24 --> 752.24
it i did place it on master b

749.44 --> 754.0790000000001
it's just they just put it this way he

752.24 --> 757.92
doesn't know how to volume

754.079 --> 759.279
doesn't think volume requires complaints

757.92 --> 761.519
and he thinks

759.279 --> 762.399
gravity causes gas to go down in one

761.519 --> 764.9590000000001
vector

762.399 --> 766.639
and he thinks entropy is c is

764.959 --> 768.56
equilibrium

766.639 --> 770.639
and he thinks what else there were so

768.56 --> 773.8389999999999
much contradictions

770.639 --> 773.839
entropy is equilibrium

775.839 --> 782.8000000000001
yep that's what he said in the beginning

779.6 --> 785.9200000000001
i'll sum it up he thinks his religious

782.8 --> 786.56
belief in the sky vacuum that you can go

785.92 --> 788.7199999999999
outside

786.56 --> 790.3199999999999
and just look up and there's gas

788.72 --> 793.839
pressure without a container

790.32 --> 793.839
that's what this guy believes

794.88 --> 797.92
that's begging the question great i

796.639 --> 800.8
believe the sky is great

797.92 --> 802.639
now look at my sky vacuum i believe it's

800.8 --> 805.5999999999999
a vacuum that proves it's a vacuum

802.639 --> 805.6
just secular reasoning

807.44 --> 810.8000000000001
well that's that's great that he

809.12 --> 812.32
believes that and he'll probably even

810.8 --> 815.1999999999999
say the signs are settled so

812.32 --> 816.8000000000001
prove it show it to us show us a vacuum

815.2 --> 817.839
next to gas pressure without any

816.8 --> 820.24
containment

817.839 --> 821.7600000000001
and the whole house of cards comes

820.24 --> 823.6800000000001
tumbling down

821.76 --> 824.88
you said the word science you've summed

823.68 --> 827.04
it up beautifully already

824.88 --> 828.0
so you or what you're detailing is how

827.04 --> 829.12
they just use a magic

828.0 --> 831.04
trick so the magic trick in this

829.12 --> 832.5600000000001
instance is to make an assertion you

831.04 --> 834.56
didn't actually detail specifically what

832.56 --> 837.76
assertion it would be alongside

834.56 --> 839.279
but you saying that they would say the

837.76 --> 841.92
science is settled

839.279 --> 843.4399999999999
that's a magic spell make a declaration

841.92 --> 845.5999999999999
that probably has absolutely

843.44 --> 846.8000000000001
more likely than not has no science in

845.6 --> 849.839
it whatsoever

846.8 --> 850.8
and say the science is settled that's a

849.839 --> 853.839
magic trick

850.8 --> 857.5999999999999
yeah it is a magic trick the

853.839 --> 859.9200000000001
the word science is back to

857.6 --> 862.5600000000001
scalentia from the latin it means

859.92 --> 865.8389999999999
knowledge so let's just switch the word

862.56 --> 868.2399999999999
the knowledge is settled

865.839 --> 872.0
great show us the knowledge oh i can't

868.24 --> 873.92
demonstrate it then it's not settled

872.0 --> 875.279
let me read something about gas pressure

873.92 --> 876.639
without a container are you ready for

875.279 --> 880.56
this

876.639 --> 881.6
yeah yep okay particles of gas in a

880.56 --> 884.079
vacuum

881.6 --> 886.0
could create pressure since their

884.079 --> 890.0
collisions with each other

886.0 --> 893.44
result in forces being exerted on areas

890.0 --> 896.639
now in parentheses they got the areas

893.44 --> 899.839
being the surfaces of the particles

896.639 --> 899.839
being collided with

902.0 --> 906.16
that's nice yeah i was gonna say that's

903.92 --> 909.12
nice sure

906.16 --> 909.12
so show it to us

909.68 --> 915.519
how they could just clump together in

912.16 --> 920.399
that particular first bump

915.519 --> 922.48
insanity of course it's insanity

920.399 --> 923.44
that's that's why i like to just pummel

922.48 --> 926.48
them with show me

923.44 --> 928.0790000000001
volume without containers

926.48 --> 929.759
then they got no way to turn it's

928.079 --> 933.199
literally volume you have to

929.759 --> 936.399
have containment to say any volume

933.199 --> 936.399
right yeah isn't that

937.44 --> 941.6
what's a pv what's the thing that they

939.36 --> 944.72
use the formula

941.6 --> 947.9200000000001
pvnrt that's sadio gastro

944.72 --> 949.6800000000001
okay so that's a hypothetical gas law

947.92 --> 954.079
right so

949.68 --> 958.079
so the ideal hypothetical

954.079 --> 958.079
t is what and v is what

959.92 --> 963.279
density changes to the volume and the

962.56 --> 965.7589999999999
temperature

963.279 --> 967.36
and pressure he's talking in comparison

965.759 --> 968.0
to what you've uh what neil's just laid

967.36 --> 970.48
out

968.0 --> 972.56
and what are you going to give the

970.48 --> 976.16
surface area in inches of a molecule

972.56 --> 977.4399999999999
that it's allegedly colliding with

976.16 --> 979.12
are you going to qualify this in any

977.44 --> 981.12
meaningful terms well you'd have to give

979.12 --> 983.44
the amount of molecules in a given area

981.12 --> 984.32
or volume to begin with so you could

983.44 --> 986.1600000000001
quantify it

984.32 --> 987.759
by how much they're going to collide

986.16 --> 989.92
with each other at what rate based on

987.759 --> 991.6
how many there are in a given area

989.92 --> 994.0
otherwise you're just saying what the

991.6 --> 994.72
psi values replace with surface area of

994.0 --> 998.0
a molecule

994.72 --> 999.519
it's absurd yeah that's what i said

998.0 --> 1000.0
that's why you just tell them you want

999.519 --> 1002.0
volume

1000.0 --> 1003.839
in containment because then they can't

1002.0 --> 1007.44
twist anyway

1003.839 --> 1011.6800000000001
yeah neil is there any sort of obviously

1007.44 --> 1013.839
reified maths attached to this

1011.68 --> 1014.959
no it's just simple physics yes there is

1013.839 --> 1017.6
there it is

1014.959 --> 1019.7589999999999
that's going to give it hold on the guy

1017.6 --> 1021.6
said

1019.759 --> 1024.0
okay in the beginning he said i always

1021.6 --> 1026.079
hear pressure defined as the force

1024.0 --> 1028.4
exerted by particles on the walls of the

1026.079 --> 1030.319
container they're being held in

1028.4 --> 1031.679
this makes sense since the mathematical

1030.319 --> 1035.039
definition of pressure

1031.679 --> 1038.24
is p equals f over a

1035.039 --> 1040.959
so can pressure exists without the walls

1038.24 --> 1043.839
to exert force on and then he goes into

1040.959 --> 1043.8390000000002
what i read before

1044.0 --> 1047.12
but does he qualify what he goes on to

1045.839 --> 1048.72
so he's justified it by saying you've

1047.12 --> 1050.7199999999998
got to have a container

1048.72 --> 1052.0
and how you'd qualify it only to then

1050.72 --> 1055.1200000000001
say yeah but they bounce off each

1052.0 --> 1056.64
other as well well they're elastic

1055.12 --> 1058.4799999999998
the problem with that declaration is the

1056.64 --> 1060.24
collisions are elastic

1058.48 --> 1062.559
not creating force they're elastic

1060.24 --> 1063.44
collisions adam detailed this about two

1062.559 --> 1066.72
weeks ago

1063.44 --> 1068.799
when he was on well the net collision

1066.72 --> 1069.919
resulting in no change or transfer of

1068.799 --> 1073.52
energy just a

1069.919 --> 1075.1200000000001
elastic collision look it up so no

1073.52 --> 1076.6399999999999
it's the force exerted on the walls of

1075.12 --> 1078.0
the container based on the number of

1076.64 --> 1079.44
particles and how many times they're

1078.0 --> 1080.88
going to collide with the wall

1079.44 --> 1082.96
and how many square inches it's going to

1080.88 --> 1084.3200000000002
collide on that's what it's calculated

1082.96 --> 1086.96
with he declares it at the beginning of

1084.32 --> 1086.96
the statement

1087.679 --> 1092.24
yeah he's debunking himself russia

1089.76 --> 1095.36
equals force over area right he gave it

1092.24 --> 1098.24
in that formula i got my boy gave now

1095.36 --> 1099.76
yes yes right so he's made the

1098.24 --> 1101.28
declaration of how the maths would work

1099.76 --> 1103.12
and then goes on to make a supposition

1101.28 --> 1106.799
that defies elastic collisions

1103.12 --> 1109.039
meaningless drivel listen to this

1106.799 --> 1110.0
he gives an example you're gonna crack

1109.039 --> 1112.4
up with this

1110.0 --> 1113.52
an example would be a self-gravitating

1112.4 --> 1114.88
ball of gas

1113.52 --> 1118.16
such as a star

1114.88 --> 1120.64
[Laughter]

1118.16 --> 1122.96
all right so another circular reasoning

1120.64 --> 1122.96
appeal

1123.679 --> 1127.44
here without containment and stars in a

1125.76 --> 1129.2
sky vacuum that gas

1127.44 --> 1130.64
burning without containment yeah just

1129.2 --> 1132.32
appeal to a whole load of second law of

1130.64 --> 1133.1200000000001
thermodynamics violations to justify

1132.32 --> 1134.72
your nonsense

1133.12 --> 1136.0
that doesn't even have any math attached

1134.72 --> 1137.84
and already justifies the thing that

1136.0 --> 1140.88
debunks it in the first statement

1137.84 --> 1140.8799999999999
yeah great citation

1141.28 --> 1144.3999999999999
yeah it's amazing

1144.48 --> 1148.84
it's amazing that guest laws actually

1146.64 --> 1150.88
are evidence for

1148.84 --> 1152.799
oh what i wouldn't say it's a claim

1150.88 --> 1154.7990000000002
because it's natural law

1152.799 --> 1156.6399999999999
and they still come and say we have

1154.799 --> 1157.52
nothing just because they point to the

1156.64 --> 1162.8400000000001
sky

1157.52 --> 1165.84
all all laws are on our side of the

1162.84 --> 1165.84
argument

1166.24 --> 1169.84
not just gas law all laws

1170.88 --> 1174.88
listen to this an example would be a

1173.12 --> 1177.12
self-gravitating ball of gas such as a

1174.88 --> 1179.3600000000001
star another example of how

1177.12 --> 1181.1999999999998
an enormous pressure can exist even

1179.36 --> 1184.4799999999998
without containing walls

1181.2 --> 1188.0
is a dynamic situation such as

1184.48 --> 1192.559
the laser driven implosion of uh

1188.0 --> 1195.36
nif capsule in this case very large

1192.559 --> 1196.32
pressures are supported by the inertia

1195.36 --> 1199.36
of the mass

1196.32 --> 1201.28
of the capsule itself of course such a

1199.36 --> 1204.32
situation can only exist

1201.28 --> 1207.12
for a short time before the capsule

1204.32 --> 1207.12
flies apart

1212.32 --> 1217.84
occurring inside a machine that creates

1215.919 --> 1220.0
this capsule as they put it in inverted

1217.84 --> 1221.9189999999999
commas inside a container

1220.0 --> 1223.679
correct and they're saying this capsule

1221.919 --> 1225.039
yes which they're describing as gas

1223.679 --> 1226.24
pressure without a container exists

1225.039 --> 1230.0
within a container

1226.24 --> 1231.76
correct correct but they also do the

1230.0 --> 1233.36
thunderfoot trick of looking at the sky

1231.76 --> 1235.12
vacuum as claimed by them

1233.36 --> 1236.9599999999998
when asked to prove it and saying well

1235.12 --> 1238.08
there's a ball of grass burning in a sky

1236.96 --> 1240.24
vacuum

1238.08 --> 1242.08
hence proving my sky vacuum because i

1240.24 --> 1244.08
assume the sun is burning ball of gas in

1242.08 --> 1245.76
vacuum and violation and natural law

1244.08 --> 1247.12
proving we can violate natural law which

1245.76 --> 1248.799
is inviolable

1247.12 --> 1250.2399999999998
no just appeal to their own

1248.799 --> 1251.679
fundamentalist religious belief as a

1250.24 --> 1252.08
proof of their fundamentalist religious

1251.679 --> 1255.2800000000002
belief

1252.08 --> 1257.28
just like thunderf00t yeah and he gets

1255.28 --> 1259.36
it from here the second answer is

1257.28 --> 1260.72
the pressure of gas is defined as the

1259.36 --> 1263.4399999999998
force of the gas

1260.72 --> 1264.48
to foster gas would exert upon a surface

1263.44 --> 1267.039
or container

1264.48 --> 1268.64
however there is no need for a container

1267.039 --> 1270.64
for pressure to exist

1268.64 --> 1272.24
for instance the air you're breathing

1270.64 --> 1275.039
right now unless you're in an

1272.24 --> 1277.679
airplane or submarine has pressure due

1275.039 --> 1280.72
to the column of atmosphere above you

1277.679 --> 1283.2
stars are balls of gas plasma actually

1280.72 --> 1284.08
that are pressurized by gravity no

1283.2 --> 1287.52
containers

1284.08 --> 1290.559
to be seen right so air gas

1287.52 --> 1293.76
is an anisotropic in inhomogeneous

1290.559 --> 1297.039
mixture of gases it does not form layers

1293.76 --> 1299.679
it does not form columns and gravity

1297.039 --> 1300.8799999999999
is not a force so we don't have

1299.679 --> 1303.6000000000001
homogenized

1300.88 --> 1304.0800000000002
layers or pillars of gas pull down go

1303.6 --> 1305.76
boom boom

1304.08 --> 1308.0
like bouncy balls in a fish tank by a

1305.76 --> 1309.679
not actual force of gravity

1308.0 --> 1311.6
to have gas pressure you require

1309.679 --> 1314.4
containment and we ask

1311.6 --> 1315.039
given that this assertion used in this

1314.4 --> 1317.52
case

1315.039 --> 1318.96
as a claim proof of the assertion how

1317.52 --> 1319.679
can we have gas pressure without a

1318.96 --> 1322.4
container

1319.679 --> 1324.0800000000002
his response look outside we've got gas

1322.4 --> 1325.76
pressure without a container i believe

1324.08 --> 1327.6
the sky's a vacuum

1325.76 --> 1329.679
that's his circular reasoning

1327.6 --> 1331.28
justification for the question of how we

1329.679 --> 1333.44
have gas in the first place

1331.28 --> 1335.12
without a container well we don't have a

1333.44 --> 1336.159
container that's how we have guests

1335.12 --> 1338.32
without it

1336.159 --> 1340.72
that's useless this guy's a [ __ ] what's

1338.32 --> 1340.72
his name

1341.36 --> 1347.76
oh let me see this

1344.84 --> 1351.28
is

1347.76 --> 1352.96
physics stack exchange that's the um

1351.28 --> 1354.48
that's the site does it give the name of

1352.96 --> 1356.96
the author

1354.48 --> 1358.64
so he can be scored by flat earthers for

1356.96 --> 1361.8400000000001
his stupidity

1358.64 --> 1361.8400000000001
or hers

1361.919 --> 1364.48
let me see

1365.039 --> 1371.039
edited is that the editor i guess sorry

1368.74 --> 1373.1200000000001
[Laughter]

1371.039 --> 1374.08
oh no the answer the answers are from

1373.12 --> 1379.6
this a guy

1374.08 --> 1379.6
called sanchez's and daniel griscom

1380.0 --> 1386.159
no phd after their name just low-level

1382.88 --> 1386.159
ignorant morons then

1386.4 --> 1390.799
what i'm saying is when you when you

1387.84 --> 1391.9189999999999
look for answers let's say on however we

1390.799 --> 1394.0
get our information

1391.919 --> 1395.76
through the internet or encyclopedias

1394.0 --> 1397.84
this is what they give you

1395.76 --> 1400.1589999999999
so like how can you be mad at these

1397.84 --> 1400.1589999999999
people

1400.24 --> 1403.919
well that i was describing and debating

1402.559 --> 1406.0
with someone i can't remember a few days

1403.919 --> 1408.5590000000002
back when i'm like

1406.0 --> 1409.2
you might have been yeah i'm talking

1408.559 --> 1410.6399999999999
about thomas

1409.2 --> 1412.159
andrew thomas young you're creating part

1410.64 --> 1412.64
of the narrative by publishing something

1412.159 --> 1414.0800000000002
like that

1412.64 --> 1416.159
and you're just a dude and these two

1414.08 --> 1417.76
guys just dudes edited by some dude

1416.159 --> 1420.159
published by some dude

1417.76 --> 1421.2
and there you have it suddenly we've got

1420.159 --> 1424.64
isotropic

1421.2 --> 1425.44
layers of gas homogenized like bloody

1424.64 --> 1427.5200000000002
plywood

1425.44 --> 1428.88
that's not how gas behaves it definitely

1427.52 --> 1430.0
doesn't go down go boom boom when it's

1428.88 --> 1432.5590000000002
expanding in all directions

1430.0 --> 1433.279
to fill the availability of volume as he

1432.559 --> 1436.08
describes

1433.279 --> 1437.6
in the article it's outrageous really

1436.08 --> 1439.76
they drop in the bit that destroys their

1437.6 --> 1441.4399999999998
own argument like it's somehow a defense

1439.76 --> 1443.12
well according to our gaspiers you've

1441.44 --> 1444.4
got to have a container but if you look

1443.12 --> 1445.9189999999999
at the sky

1444.4 --> 1448.0800000000002
given that we're being asked how that

1445.919 --> 1449.3600000000001
has gas pressure without containment

1448.08 --> 1451.279
i'm going to assert that that's gas

1449.36 --> 1452.4799999999998
pressure without containment

1451.279 --> 1454.32
so you're not answering the question

1452.48 --> 1457.039
you're just repeating back the question

1454.32 --> 1458.6399999999999
like it's an answer yeah how do we have

1457.039 --> 1460.64
that gas pressure without containment

1458.64 --> 1461.76
not just i think it is gas pressure

1460.64 --> 1463.919
without containment

1461.76 --> 1466.559
natural law dictates that if this black

1463.919 --> 1468.72
area was 10 to the minus 17 torr vacuum

1466.559 --> 1470.1589999999999
then the gas at high pressure would

1468.72 --> 1472.32
expand in all directions to fill the

1470.159 --> 1473.8400000000001
availability volume its natural law

1472.32 --> 1475.279
free expansion into a vacuum as

1473.84 --> 1476.08
described by the second law of

1475.279 --> 1478.24
thermodynamics

1476.08 --> 1479.84
based on our bloody gas behaves doesn't

1478.24 --> 1480.799
go down go boom boom it's not forming

1479.84 --> 1484.0
layers

1480.799 --> 1486.4
so just absurd nonsense from idiots

1484.0 --> 1489.039
gee i think a guy named 10th man did a

1486.4 --> 1492.159
video called what is the vacuum

1489.039 --> 1494.8799999999999
well the good news is well the good news

1492.159 --> 1496.72
is everything is being challenged now

1494.88 --> 1499.44
it's not just us it's getting around

1496.72 --> 1501.44
everybody's channel

1499.44 --> 1502.72
even on those days last night everybody

1501.44 --> 1505.679
was saying no

1502.72 --> 1506.64
it's not a vacuum no it's not separate

1505.679 --> 1510.0
you know they're all

1506.64 --> 1511.8400000000001
throwing their own model now

1510.0 --> 1513.52
under the bus because they know every

1511.84 --> 1515.039
every angle we take is just destroying

1513.52 --> 1517.039
them

1515.039 --> 1518.64
well i've never seen a baller go into a

1517.039 --> 1519.2
convenience store and say give me a

1518.64 --> 1522.24
volume

1519.2 --> 1523.76
of milk or give me a mass of milk don't

1522.24 --> 1526.32
let it stress you because there's

1523.76 --> 1527.6
a breaking point in the argument where

1526.32 --> 1528.96
there's got to be a point where the

1527.6 --> 1530.3999999999999
people with cognitive dissonance

1528.96 --> 1531.1200000000001
effectively relinquish their own

1530.4 --> 1533.1200000000001
argument

1531.12 --> 1535.039
like it's a rebuttal it's the end of the

1533.12 --> 1536.3999999999999
argument now that can be frustrating for

1535.039 --> 1537.84
those of us that just want them to say

1536.4 --> 1538.5590000000002
yeah i appreciate the sky is not a

1537.84 --> 1540.1589999999999
vacuum

1538.559 --> 1542.08
but what are they actually saying you're

1540.159 --> 1542.88
saying the guys on the globe side on a

1542.08 --> 1544.96
different

1542.88 --> 1546.48
non-flat earth debate related channel

1544.96 --> 1549.279
are saying

1546.48 --> 1551.279
the sky's not a vacuum and then to go on

1549.279 --> 1552.32
to justify why it isn't precisely what

1551.279 --> 1554.88
they claim it is

1552.32 --> 1556.6399999999999
yeah well that's the end of the road

1554.88 --> 1557.919
like with a geometric horizon blocking

1556.64 --> 1560.0800000000002
boats and buildings we don't have a

1557.919 --> 1563.039
geometric horizon says globe believer

1560.08 --> 1564.6399999999999
yeah bye bye globe belief no no it still

1563.039 --> 1565.919
means i can retain it okay well i will

1564.64 --> 1567.919
just laugh at you while you do

1565.919 --> 1569.679
your models become untenable same with

1567.919 --> 1572.64
the sky vacuum oh what so

1569.679 --> 1573.8400000000001
it's uh unfalsifiable and not a vacuum

1572.64 --> 1576.24
that's their current rebuttal

1573.84 --> 1577.84
yeah welcome to flat earth what we don't

1576.24 --> 1579.039
have a second reference frame turning

1577.84 --> 1580.8799999999999
underneath no drift

1579.039 --> 1582.48
welcome to flat earth oh we don't have a

1580.88 --> 1583.679
geometric horizon blocking boats and

1582.48 --> 1586.24
buildings it can't be seen

1583.679 --> 1588.64
welcome to flat earth no no you guys

1586.24 --> 1591.679
believe you've got a geometry [ __ ] that

1588.64 --> 1592.88
excuse my french

1591.679 --> 1595.039
yeah i was going to say you're going to

1592.88 --> 1597.3600000000001
run out of welcome mats

1595.039 --> 1598.559
welcoming every argument that they have

1597.36 --> 1601.6
to go back and change

1598.559 --> 1604.08
because it's uh the science is not

1601.6 --> 1605.84
settled so welcome to flat earth yeah

1604.08 --> 1607.76
yeah i said a long time ago nathan

1605.84 --> 1610.84
should not say welcome to flat earth

1607.76 --> 1612.1589999999999
but he should say get the hell out of

1610.84 --> 1614.48
flatters

1612.159 --> 1615.919
wow well a lot of people on this panel

1614.48 --> 1617.679
probably had cognitive dissonance at

1615.919 --> 1619.1200000000001
some stage during their journey neil so

1617.679 --> 1620.159
if i was to tell everyone to sod off

1619.12 --> 1622.0
when they're here

1620.159 --> 1624.0800000000002
i said it was zinda it was reminded

1622.0 --> 1627.36
because qe replayed it

1624.08 --> 1628.32
he's here or was at the time discussing

1627.36 --> 1630.9599999999998
this matter

1628.32 --> 1632.3999999999999
so there's people who have no cognitive

1630.96 --> 1633.2
dissonance because there's none to be

1632.4 --> 1634.48
had

1633.2 --> 1636.4
they just know there are a sphere and

1634.48 --> 1637.84
it's nothing to be concerned about then

1636.4 --> 1640.159
there's the next step which is

1637.84 --> 1641.1999999999998
cognitive dissonance the zinders the

1640.159 --> 1642.64
heads

1641.2 --> 1644.72
they hold two different contrasting

1642.64 --> 1645.5200000000002
positions simultaneously it can't be

1644.72 --> 1648.72
squared

1645.52 --> 1650.32
it's a circle that's unsquarable

1648.72 --> 1652.72
so what do they do they come and

1650.32 --> 1654.48
challenge us well that's one step along

1652.72 --> 1655.679
that road isn't it well if you want to

1654.48 --> 1658.88
tell them to bugger off well

1655.679 --> 1658.88
i've got a whole show about that

1661.12 --> 1665.52
that was great that one with gender

1662.72 --> 1666.559
because he would say i'm not saying

1665.52 --> 1670.559
science

1666.559 --> 1670.559
i don't is that's your science

1670.799 --> 1679.44
science scientific method he claimed was

1675.919 --> 1679.76
a qe scientific method but the point is

1679.44 --> 1681.919
that

1679.76 --> 1683.84
up until 2019 we were told maybe even

1681.919 --> 1686.0
earlier 2017 we were told the whole body

1683.84 --> 1687.36
of science proves that we're on a sphere

1686.0 --> 1688.72
now we're at the stage where they don't

1687.36 --> 1690.1589999999999
even want to declare science because

1688.72 --> 1691.3600000000001
they know they're going to get pummeled

1690.159 --> 1693.679
so they don't want to say they want to

1691.36 --> 1695.9189999999999
go that's your science it's like

1693.679 --> 1696.72
we don't go around saying science proves

1695.919 --> 1698.72
a flat earth

1696.72 --> 1700.0
we've never said it we won't say it

1698.72 --> 1702.88
that's not what we

1700.0 --> 1704.08
say they the globers have said science

1702.88 --> 1706.5590000000002
proofs are on a globe

1704.08 --> 1707.76
simple fact they've got a whole

1706.559 --> 1710.8799999999999
different discipline

1707.76 --> 1712.64
they call science that's not science

1710.88 --> 1714.159
so they can claim we're on a sphere and

1712.64 --> 1715.5200000000002
everyone's been duped by it and thinks

1714.159 --> 1717.7600000000002
they've been real

1715.52 --> 1718.799
science achievements achieved and they

1717.76 --> 1720.24
haven't been

1718.799 --> 1721.9189999999999
so they go around punting that they've

1720.24 --> 1723.6
got science and they haven't

1721.919 --> 1725.6000000000001
that's why we rip them apart on their

1723.6 --> 1726.799
lack of it but then they don't want to

1725.6 --> 1727.84
attract they don't want to

1726.799 --> 1728.96
use it they don't want to say they've

1727.84 --> 1730.1589999999999
got any science anymore because they

1728.96 --> 1731.2
know they're terrified of their own

1730.159 --> 1732.3990000000001
claims at the moment

1731.2 --> 1734.32
they're terrified to claim they've got

1732.399 --> 1736.0
drift they're terrified to claim they've

1734.32 --> 1736.799
got a geometric horizon blocking boats

1736.0 --> 1738.159
and buildings

1736.799 --> 1740.08
they're terrified to claim they've got a

1738.159 --> 1741.3600000000001
vacuum it's like my god do you not know

1740.08 --> 1742.8799999999999
what your religion is it's a spinning

1741.36 --> 1743.9189999999999
ball flying through a vacuum

1742.88 --> 1744.96
but yeah you don't want to claim it's a

1743.919 --> 1746.48
vacuum you don't want to claim it's

1744.96 --> 1747.76
spinning and you don't claim we've got a

1746.48 --> 1749.279
geometric horizon

1747.76 --> 1750.48
well what have you got i'll tell you

1749.279 --> 1751.52
what you've got you've got a flat earth

1750.48 --> 1753.279
beneath your feet

1751.52 --> 1754.799
that's not spinning that's what you've

1753.279 --> 1756.96
got yeah

1754.799 --> 1758.72
they run away from every argument and

1756.96 --> 1760.159
stole clan victory

1758.72 --> 1761.84
well we're back we're back to the

1760.159 --> 1764.3990000000001
beginning of the question

1761.84 --> 1766.399
uh the science has settled so semantics

1764.399 --> 1768.4799999999998
is very important what science are you

1766.399 --> 1770.8799999999999
talking about are you talking about the

1768.48 --> 1772.48
scientific method are you talking about

1770.88 --> 1774.5590000000002
natural science

1772.48 --> 1775.679
are you talking about social science are

1774.559 --> 1781.12
you talking about

1775.679 --> 1783.2
knowledge of different things

1781.12 --> 1784.6399999999999
scientific method is natural sciences by

1783.2 --> 1786.48
the way no no i know

1784.64 --> 1787.679
i know i'm just saying i'm just saying

1786.48 --> 1791.2
that when you look up

1787.679 --> 1793.039
uh a university's courses on science

1791.2 --> 1795.2
you can see because the word science

1793.039 --> 1796.559
means knowledge so they attach

1795.2 --> 1798.24
science that's what i'm saying it's

1796.559 --> 1799.6
interchangeable to the word knowledge

1798.24 --> 1801.36
knowledge of this knowledge of that

1799.6 --> 1802.8799999999999
knowledge of that but then you say what

1801.36 --> 1805.279
can you prove

1802.88 --> 1808.0
empirically well that has to go through

1805.279 --> 1811.12
the scientific method which has to do

1808.0 --> 1814.159
with what a natural world oh

1811.12 --> 1814.8799999999999
it could only be applied oh now i now

1814.159 --> 1818.0
understand

1814.88 --> 1819.6000000000001
so i am a paint scientist because i do

1818.0 --> 1821.84
painting science

1819.6 --> 1823.36
you have a holiday shopping stop so what

1821.84 --> 1824.32
that actually gets answered

1823.36 --> 1826.08
is because there's a question on the

1824.32 --> 1826.96
table from 10th man what science do they

1826.08 --> 1828.96
have

1826.96 --> 1830.08
well they have a definition for what

1828.96 --> 1832.32
they've claimed

1830.08 --> 1834.6399999999999
they called it science now you've got

1832.32 --> 1837.4399999999998
flat soy saying i'm a painting scientist

1834.64 --> 1838.64
well that's useful once it's declared to

1837.44 --> 1840.799
be science

1838.64 --> 1841.919
if there's not been an adherence to the

1840.799 --> 1844.84
scientific method

1841.919 --> 1846.64
it falls under a new definition

1844.84 --> 1849.36
pseudoscience

1846.64 --> 1850.24
so soon as he says i'm a scientist in

1849.36 --> 1851.76
paint

1850.24 --> 1853.44
unless he's establishing the cause and

1851.76 --> 1854.24
effect reasoning behind a man-made

1853.44 --> 1856.0
product

1854.24 --> 1857.679
which he's not going to be he's

1856.0 --> 1858.0
definitely become a pseudo-science in

1857.679 --> 1859.6000000000001
that

1858.0 --> 1861.279
pseudo-science practitioner in that

1859.6 --> 1864.24
declaration as

1861.279 --> 1865.44
have all who claimed science proved a

1864.24 --> 1867.6
sphere

1865.44 --> 1869.44
ultimately any declaration that hasn't

1867.6 --> 1872.24
adhered to that method is pseudoscience

1869.44 --> 1872.24
that's the definition

1873.519 --> 1880.96
yeah not actual well if uh

1878.399 --> 1882.0
says he's a scientific painter he's a

1880.96 --> 1884.559
tintoff i

1882.0 --> 1884.559
tell you that

1886.48 --> 1893.84
well i do deal with ancient every day

1889.519 --> 1893.84
watching paige right

1895.76 --> 1898.399
that's great

1899.039 --> 1904.0
oh so much fun can i read something else

1904.399 --> 1907.6
you can of course you've got four

1905.919 --> 1909.679
minutes five minutes

1907.6 --> 1911.519
it's it it's in this is where i always

1909.679 --> 1913.919
go back to the bible

1911.519 --> 1916.0
it's in timothy and he's he's given

1913.919 --> 1918.159
instruction to timothy saying

1916.0 --> 1920.48
laying up in store for themselves a good

1918.159 --> 1923.519
foundation against the time to come

1920.48 --> 1925.44
that they may lay hold on eternal life o

1923.519 --> 1928.24
timothy keep that which is committed to

1925.44 --> 1930.0800000000002
thy trust avoiding profane and vain

1928.24 --> 1933.279
babblings and oppositions

1930.08 --> 1935.279
of science falsely so called or should i

1933.279 --> 1938.64
put pseudoscience in there

1935.279 --> 1942.0
thank you very much that's timothy what

1938.64 --> 1944.72
first timothy 6 19. yeah

1942.0 --> 1946.559
that's as poignant as it could get

1944.72 --> 1947.2
absolutely that which is labeled science

1946.559 --> 1948.48
and isn't

1947.2 --> 1949.919
that's pseudoscience that's the

1948.48 --> 1952.559
definition and precisely what we've

1949.919 --> 1956.7990000000002
currently got claiming we're on a sphere

1952.559 --> 1956.799
well said well or well red

1957.44 --> 1961.519
must be a word it's not quoted isn't it

1959.6 --> 1962.32
when you say well read from scripture

1961.519 --> 1965.76
that must be a short

1962.32 --> 1967.279
word well we usually just say excellent

1965.76 --> 1971.279
scripture

1967.279 --> 1973.44
excellent scripture it's it's superbowl

1971.279 --> 1975.76
chap

1973.44 --> 1977.1200000000001
just pointing out british on that point

1975.76 --> 1979.76
on point you know it's

1977.12 --> 1979.76
that's what it is

1980.64 --> 1984.0800000000002
do i read it again while we live in the

1982.08 --> 1986.32
world hold on just read it one more time

1984.08 --> 1986.32
neil

1988.32 --> 1993.519
okay it starts at verse 19. it says

1991.6 --> 1994.6399999999999
laying up in store for themselves a good

1993.519 --> 1997.1200000000001
foundation

1994.64 --> 1997.679
against the time to come that they may

1997.12 --> 2000.559
hold

1997.679 --> 2002.64
they may lay hold on eternal life oh

2000.559 --> 2003.6789999999999
timothy keep that which is committed to

2002.64 --> 2007.1200000000001
your trust

2003.679 --> 2010.48
avoiding fame profane and vain babblings

2007.12 --> 2013.4399999999998
and oppositions of science

2010.48 --> 2014.96
falsely so-called so i just put

2013.44 --> 2017.2
pseudoscience in there

2014.96 --> 2019.3600000000001
yeah yeah science falsely so-called is

2017.2 --> 2021.039
pseudoscience

2019.36 --> 2022.559
babbling's wow doesn't that sound

2021.039 --> 2026.0
familiar

2022.559 --> 2029.36
yeah they have been babbling

2026.0 --> 2029.36
and we have real science

2030.0 --> 2034.0
yeah you could say ed too you could put

2032.08 --> 2037.6
a number of names in there

2034.0 --> 2039.36
yeah that's not well it's it's it's

2037.6 --> 2041.039
important because what happens is that

2039.36 --> 2042.8799999999999
people in the trenches come in here with

2041.039 --> 2044.64
the vein babblings like you said the

2042.88 --> 2046.64
normies just accepts it there's no

2044.64 --> 2047.6000000000001
cognitive dissonance until you bring it

2046.64 --> 2049.839
up to them

2047.6 --> 2051.44
and then the normies like the eyes get

2049.839 --> 2051.839
really wide open and then they're going

2051.44 --> 2053.52
wow

2051.839 --> 2055.2
never thought about it that way but then

2053.52 --> 2056.32
when the guys come here in the trenches

2055.2 --> 2057.919
they have thought about it

2056.32 --> 2060.639
and they still want to defend the

2057.919 --> 2060.96
undefendable so they have two positions

2060.639 --> 2063.839
on

2060.96 --> 2064.8
at least minimum two positions on each

2063.839 --> 2067.679
argument

2064.8 --> 2068.079
but here's the problem the two positions

2067.679 --> 2069.919
are at

2068.079 --> 2071.8390000000004
the other end of the argument opposing

2069.919 --> 2075.839
each other and they hold both

2071.839 --> 2075.839
who would listen to a guy like that

2077.909 --> 2104.28
[Music]

2107.52 --> 2120.0
what a lovely day

2116.64 --> 2121.92

2136.16 --> 2138.48
alongside each of these shows while they

2137.839 --> 2140.64
are live

2138.48 --> 2142.88
there's also a paypal patreon and crypto

please also share the show on social

2165.28 --> 2168.96
media sharing the show obviously

2167.28 --> 2170.4
increases the live audience but this in

2168.96 --> 2172.56
turn increases the chances

2170.4 --> 2174.88
of a more diverse panel so please share

2172.56 --> 2176.16
the show on facebook and twitter

2174.88 --> 2177.6800000000003

2184.0 --> 2189.68
now we are joined by neil 10th man

2187.68 --> 2191.44
hotzoid and chocolate sane together with

2189.68 --> 2196.48
a whole bunch of people in discord so

2191.44 --> 2202.0
welcome one and all four more hours

2196.48 --> 2203.44
good morning baby yeah good morning

2202.0 --> 2205.68
good morning good morning very

2203.44 --> 2207.44
enthusiastic a lot excellent

2205.68 --> 2208.96
almost a whole week of enthusiastic good

2207.44 --> 2209.68
mornings at the beginning of the live

2208.96 --> 2211.599
show

2209.68 --> 2214.0789999999997
couldn't be more pleased any signs of a

2211.599 --> 2217.839
physical geometric sphere edge horizon

2214.079 --> 2217.8390000000004
formerly known as the curve of the earth

2218.079 --> 2225.04
definitely not any globus

2221.599 --> 2227.28
want to challenge that it's only in the

2225.04 --> 2229.119
mass right

2227.28 --> 2230.8
well we could summarize that position if

2229.119 --> 2231.52
no one pipes up just give it a couple

2230.8 --> 2232.96
more seconds

2231.52 --> 2236.0
is there any newbies i've not taken off

2232.96 --> 2237.52
meat [ __ ] it

2236.0 --> 2240.64
don't don't do that because they might

2237.52 --> 2242.72
think it's our position

2240.64 --> 2244.72
yeah well chocolate you you way ahead of

2242.72 --> 2245.359
me that's precisely why i'm going to do

2244.72 --> 2247.5989999999997
it

2245.359 --> 2248.64
so the current well no not exactly

2247.599 --> 2249.6800000000003
because i'm going to give their rebuttal

2248.64 --> 2251.68
their current rebuttal

2249.68 --> 2254.0
is to say that we don't see a geometric

2251.68 --> 2255.68
physical sphere at horizon

2254.0 --> 2257.68
it can't be seen and can't be measured

2255.68 --> 2260.72
even though it's the basis of the maths

2257.68 --> 2263.359
that's their rebuttal yeah

2260.72 --> 2264.8799999999997
refraction but how do you fracture an

2263.359 --> 2265.7599999999998
action without having a geometric clear

2264.88 --> 2267.6800000000003
marker that's not a

2265.76 --> 2269.119
that's not a rebuttal they may assert

2267.68 --> 2270.0
that here that's not a rebuttal because

2269.119 --> 2271.6800000000003
their refraction

2270.0 --> 2273.52
is using the r value the very thing

2271.68 --> 2275.1189999999997
we're asking about its physicality and

2273.52 --> 2277.52
their claim it blocks things

2275.119 --> 2279.44
well they're saying that the refraction

2277.52 --> 2280.4
used in your claim to be a rebuttal but

2279.44 --> 2282.48
isn't

2280.4 --> 2283.839
is based on that r value so the fact

2282.48 --> 2284.32
that you can't see or measure that r

2283.839 --> 2286.0
value

2284.32 --> 2288.0
by way of a geometric physical sphere

2286.0 --> 2290.16
edge horizon and a dip angle measurement

2288.0 --> 2291.52
utilized by albarooni or anything other

2290.16 --> 2294.56
than that

2291.52 --> 2297.52
you can't use r to move the horizon

2294.56 --> 2300.32
with r if you can't measure r so that's

2297.52 --> 2300.32
not a rebuttal

2301.28 --> 2307.28
nathan hello it's not a robot

2304.64 --> 2308.64
it's a concession it's a con exactly

2307.28 --> 2310.0
implodes the model it puts the model

2308.64 --> 2311.2799999999997
into a paradox whoever that was in

2310.0 --> 2314.16
discord yes go ahead

2311.28 --> 2316.5600000000004
and shout out to troy d'or nathan super

2314.16 --> 2318.56
chat thank you yes hi

2316.56 --> 2320.64
i have a question uh i've been listening

2318.56 --> 2323.599
to you for like a week now and you guys

2320.64 --> 2324.8799999999997
make a lot of good points but you know

2323.599 --> 2327.04
you do

2324.88 --> 2328.7200000000003
you know the same questions every day i

2327.04 --> 2329.2
was just wondering how come you guys

2328.72 --> 2330.8799999999997
don't

2329.2 --> 2332.72
like take it to the next step and try to

2330.88 --> 2335.6800000000003
do an experiment you know like

2332.72 --> 2336.0
you guys buy a rocket put an iphone on

2335.68 --> 2339.2799999999997
there

2336.0 --> 2343.599
send it up something

2339.28 --> 2343.599
that could uh okay help out

2346.48 --> 2350.16
like i seen on youtube amateur rocket

2349.28 --> 2351.76
that one

2350.16 --> 2353.5989999999997
that whenever i thought you guys could

2351.76 --> 2354.88
do something similar a balloon with a

2353.599 --> 2356.6400000000003
phone

2354.88 --> 2359.119
for what purpose what are we looking for

2356.64 --> 2360.16
with this imagery that comes back

2359.119 --> 2362.32
where is it going and what are we

2360.16 --> 2365.68
looking for in the footage

2362.32 --> 2367.52
well because i mean you could do

2365.68 --> 2369.2799999999997
you know like you guys are going through

2367.52 --> 2371.839
these questions every day

2369.28 --> 2372.32
but if you never do an experiment yeah i

2371.839 --> 2373.44
heard that

2372.32 --> 2374.7200000000003
are we headed off we're just going to

2373.44 --> 2376.16
get our heads i don't need you to

2374.72 --> 2377.52
replace yourself i heard

2376.16 --> 2379.52
you don't need to repeat that my

2377.52 --> 2383.359
question i'll repeat slower

2379.52 --> 2387.04
what are we looking for

2383.359 --> 2392.0
in the imagery you

2387.04 --> 2392.0
say we should acquire

2393.28 --> 2397.52
to see what what's up there isn't that

2395.28 --> 2402.5600000000004
the whole point of the discussion

2397.52 --> 2405.68
what's up where above our heads

2402.56 --> 2407.04
and that's going to prove what now it's

2405.68 --> 2409.2799999999997
going to prove your claim

2407.04 --> 2410.079
that you know you can't have vacuum

2409.28 --> 2411.76
without a physical

2410.079 --> 2413.119
barrier or it's going to prove their

2411.76 --> 2416.2400000000002
claim that

2413.119 --> 2416.7200000000003
you just fly out into space i see number

2416.24 --> 2418.56
one

2416.72 --> 2421.1189999999997
that's not a claim i make that's natural

2418.56 --> 2422.4
law you mistakenly think that my claim

2421.119 --> 2424.079
that you can't have gas pressure without

2422.4 --> 2428.4
a container is a claim

2424.079 --> 2431.599
when it's in fact natural law inviolable

2428.4 --> 2432.88
do you know what inviolable means not a

2431.599 --> 2433.76
claim i'm making not something that

2432.88 --> 2436.6400000000003
needs proving

2433.76 --> 2438.0
inviolable natural law so you can't have

2436.64 --> 2439.839
gas pressure without a container i

2438.0 --> 2444.4
believe we covered this with you

2439.839 --> 2444.4
personally less than 24 hours ago

2445.2 --> 2448.7999999999997
yeah no we spoke yesterday yeah we did

2447.28 --> 2451.0400000000004
yeah yeah yeah i know

2448.8 --> 2453.119
i haven't got a short memory so you

2451.04 --> 2455.04
appreciated and conceded that the sky is

2453.119 --> 2458.4
definitely not a vacuum

2455.04 --> 2460.56
yesterday yeah i i agree with your

2458.4 --> 2462.0
so why are you now challenging me so you

2460.56 --> 2463.44
agree so thank you

2462.0 --> 2466.079
why are you now challenging me to send

2463.44 --> 2467.68
some balloon up to a sky vacuum when i

2466.079 --> 2468.319
can already disprove it and have done

2467.68 --> 2470.8799999999997
with you

2468.319 --> 2472.56
personally within the last 24 hours why

2470.88 --> 2474.4
would i now need to send a balloon

2472.56 --> 2476.4
when by your own words and now under

2474.4 --> 2477.599
muting through my demolition of your

2476.4 --> 2478.4
claim that you think i need to now

2477.599 --> 2479.52
disprove

2478.4 --> 2481.92
even though i've already done it within

2479.52 --> 2483.359
the last 24 hours what on earth would i

2481.92 --> 2485.28
be trying to achieve given that i've

2483.359 --> 2488.48
already achieved it with you personally

2485.28 --> 2488.48
within the last day

2488.64 --> 2495.2
well it's achieving would be let's see

2491.92 --> 2496.7200000000003
what is we're actually we if you just

2495.2 --> 2498.64
sit here and do this debate every day

2496.72 --> 2500.8799999999997
it's just worth it third repetition i

2498.64 --> 2503.68
heard let's see what right

2500.88 --> 2505.2000000000003
can i think i need it three times hello

2503.68 --> 2506.96
i don't need you to repeat your claim

2505.2 --> 2509.839
three times finish my sentence

2506.96 --> 2510.48
i heard it the second and first time you

2509.839 --> 2512.88
said it

2510.48 --> 2513.599
i don't need a third repetition you dumb

2512.88 --> 2515.359
fool

2513.599 --> 2516.88
i heard if you're gonna sit here doing

2515.359 --> 2517.68
the debates then you need to go and do

2516.88 --> 2519.92
an experiment

2517.68 --> 2520.7999999999997
you think i need a third time you dumb

2519.92 --> 2524.079
cracker

2520.8 --> 2526.96
i heard i asked you what he was gonna

2524.079 --> 2527.599
achieve don't talk through me fundy [ __ ]

2526.96 --> 2529.76
wit

2527.599 --> 2531.119
i'm telling you i've already disproved

2529.76 --> 2533.2000000000003
the sky as a vacuum

2531.119 --> 2534.6400000000003
you've told me to send up a balloon to

2533.2 --> 2536.48
try and prove it either way

2534.64 --> 2538.4
i've already debunked it with you

2536.48 --> 2539.76
personally and your response is to

2538.4 --> 2541.839
repeat the same thing

2539.76 --> 2543.3590000000004
for the third time and tell me you need

2541.839 --> 2545.52
to get to the end of your sentence

2543.359 --> 2546.88
about debates and what they're achieving

2545.52 --> 2550.4
and not experiments

2546.88 --> 2552.079
i heard i'm not deaf

2550.4 --> 2553.599
so we're not going to be going up to

2552.079 --> 2554.0
disprove a sky vacuum with a balloon

2553.599 --> 2556.7200000000003
then

2554.0 --> 2557.52
your suggestion is ludicrous pointless

2556.72 --> 2559.2799999999997
absurd

2557.52 --> 2560.64
and have already debunked the thing

2559.28 --> 2562.5600000000004
you're trying to get

2560.64 --> 2564.16
us to try and disprove with this

2562.56 --> 2567.839
nonsense do you

2564.16 --> 2569.359
understand so we should never go out

2567.839 --> 2571.599
into reality you

2569.359 --> 2573.92
can concede that the sky's not a vacuum

2571.599 --> 2578.0
already because you've already done it

2573.92 --> 2580.48
within the last 24 hours you idiot

2578.0 --> 2582.4
no yeah you could prove your life yeah

2580.48 --> 2583.2
so we don't need to go up in a [ __ ]

2582.4 --> 2586.4
balloon

2583.2 --> 2587.68
you've already conceded it's beyond the

2586.4 --> 2591.6800000000003
constraints

2587.68 --> 2594.48
of natural law i don't need a balloon

2591.68 --> 2596.0
hello so what else are we looking for

2594.48 --> 2597.68
we're not going to be disproving sky

2596.0 --> 2599.599
vacuum i've already done it

2597.68 --> 2600.96
so anything else you think we should

2599.599 --> 2604.0
achieve with this balloon

2600.96 --> 2607.04
you suggest we send up

2604.0 --> 2607.68
no we should just so shut up you stupid

2607.04 --> 2609.68
dick

2607.68 --> 2612.16
sit down with your balloon suggestion

2609.68 --> 2614.8799999999997
and know your stupid place here

2612.16 --> 2615.44
that's to shut up listen to the educated

2614.88 --> 2617.28
people

2615.44 --> 2619.28
and not suggest things that you're not

2617.28 --> 2620.88
doing when i've already disproved the

2619.28 --> 2623.8390000000004
point it doesn't make

2620.88 --> 2626.4
you stupid idiot now sit down and try

2623.839 --> 2628.88
and comprehend the things we tell you

2626.4 --> 2628.88
okay

2630.079 --> 2634.4
good dog sit down and know your place

2632.88 --> 2636.2400000000002
you idiot

2634.4 --> 2638.0
send a balloon up you send the balloon

2636.24 --> 2640.64
up you know see what you see

2638.0 --> 2642.16
[ __ ] see if you see a sky vacuum when

2640.64 --> 2644.48
you send up a balloon

2642.16 --> 2646.16
rather than challenging me on what i do

2644.48 --> 2648.16
i do this daily

2646.16 --> 2649.839
i've made more strides in this subject

2648.16 --> 2652.0789999999997
that you've had on dinners

2649.839 --> 2653.92
don't tell me what to do with a balloon

2652.079 --> 2655.92
when you've already seen them on youtube

2653.92 --> 2658.64
not disproving the sky vacuum

2655.92 --> 2659.28
and i'm doing it with natural law for

2658.64 --> 2661.839
you

2659.28 --> 2664.7200000000003
within the last day how short your

2661.839 --> 2667.839
memory you thicko

2664.72 --> 2669.9199999999996
no i'm just saying don't don't just say

2667.839 --> 2672.0
anything sit down and shut up

2669.92 --> 2673.119
know how stupid you are and how much

2672.0 --> 2674.079
you're getting told off for your

2673.119 --> 2677.52
stupidity

2674.079 --> 2680.079
by a flat earther understand your place

2677.52 --> 2681.68
that's being told off by me the flat

2680.079 --> 2683.52
earther who knows what's what

2681.68 --> 2686.3999999999996
has already told at you within the last

2683.52 --> 2688.72
24 hours and you see fit to challenge

2686.4 --> 2690.64
with some absurd claim that can't be

2688.72 --> 2693.04
disproven with a balloon

2690.64 --> 2694.4
you understand me you idiot challenging

2693.04 --> 2696.24
anything um yeah you are you're

2694.4 --> 2696.64
challenging me to send a [ __ ] balloon

2696.24 --> 2698.72
up

2696.64 --> 2700.0
to disprove a sky vacuum because i've

2698.72 --> 2701.2
tied you down on what you think you'll

2700.0 --> 2704.079
achieve with this [ __ ]

2701.2 --> 2705.359
and it won't what it will achieve is

2704.079 --> 2706.96
zero

2705.359 --> 2709.2799999999997
yet tell me what else you think this

2706.96 --> 2711.92
balloon i should send it will achieve

2709.28 --> 2713.2000000000003
it won't disprove a sky vacuum natural

2711.92 --> 2716.64
law does that

2713.2 --> 2718.64
you already conceded it you idiot

2716.64 --> 2720.64
so if you sit in your house all day just

2718.64 --> 2723.2799999999997
talking so you want to add on me now if

2720.64 --> 2725.7599999999998
i sit in my house all day this is my job

2723.28 --> 2726.88
sat in my house i call this my studio

2725.76 --> 2728.6400000000003
it's my job

2726.88 --> 2730.48
how dare you the amount of people who

2728.64 --> 2731.839
work from home at the moment and you're

2730.48 --> 2732.72
going to criticize me from doing this

2731.839 --> 2733.92
from here

2732.72 --> 2736.0
you're going to criticize off the

2733.92 --> 2737.76
[ __ ] world they're all working from

2736.0 --> 2739.2
home at the moment you stupid idiot

2737.76 --> 2741.44
yeah that's going to be a successful ad

2739.2 --> 2743.839
hominem attack

2741.44 --> 2744.8
it's not an ad harmony yeah what you sit

2743.839 --> 2747.44
there at home

2744.8 --> 2748.96
yeah i do pummeling your globe faith

2747.44 --> 2752.7200000000003
based on natural law

2748.96 --> 2754.88
not balloons i should send up idiots

2752.72 --> 2756.48
if there's no action just talk then

2754.88 --> 2758.96
you'll never find the truth

2756.48 --> 2761.28
that's what that's an at home talk i've

2758.96 --> 2762.079
described the annihilation of the sky

2761.28 --> 2765.0400000000004
vacuum

2762.079 --> 2766.96
by way of natural law the entropy law

2765.04 --> 2768.48
the increase of entropy that would

2766.96 --> 2768.96
dictate that we wouldn't have any air to

2768.48 --> 2771.28
breathe

2768.96 --> 2772.48
you conceded it within the last 24 hours

2771.28 --> 2773.52
and you're now telling me i'm not

2772.48 --> 2775.04
achieving anything

2773.52 --> 2776.8
because i'm not sending up your balloon

2775.04 --> 2777.68
to disprove a sky vacuum i've already

2776.8 --> 2780.88
debunked

2777.68 --> 2782.96
you're a [ __ ] let's

2780.88 --> 2785.04
go take some of your youtube money and

2782.96 --> 2786.48
go now that's an ad hom number three so

2785.04 --> 2787.839
you can get the [ __ ] out of my show

2786.48 --> 2789.839
you're not gonna see her and homie three

2787.839 --> 2791.68
times in a row you stupid dick you'll be

2789.839 --> 2793.52
berated for your stupidity

2791.68 --> 2795.52
not oh you can take some of your youtube

2793.52 --> 2796.96
money i'll use that to feed my family

2795.52 --> 2797.839
that's what i do with this money that i

2796.96 --> 2800.8
earn here

2797.839 --> 2802.4
limited though it is however my main

2800.8 --> 2803.04
purpose at the moment is berating a

2802.4 --> 2804.319
[ __ ]

2803.04 --> 2806.16
who thinks sending a balloon will

2804.319 --> 2806.96
disprove something he's already conceded

2806.16 --> 2809.92
as fake

2806.96 --> 2812.16
that would be the sky vacuum yeah [ __ ]

2809.92 --> 2814.0
thing you conceded on yesterday's show

2812.16 --> 2816.24
you asked what happened yesterday 10th

2814.0 --> 2819.68
this dick globe believer conceded

2816.24 --> 2821.1189999999997
the sky is not a vacuum it sits directly

2819.68 --> 2822.3999999999996
in violation of the second law of

2821.119 --> 2824.88
thermodynamics

2822.4 --> 2826.56
if the sky was a vacuum the gas we

2824.88 --> 2828.48
breathed would fill the space

2826.56 --> 2830.319
without the container there can be no

2828.48 --> 2831.839
pressure and get this dixie's fit to

2830.319 --> 2832.8
come here and challenge me to send a

2831.839 --> 2835.2
balloon

2832.8 --> 2836.7200000000003
to disprove so he's already conceded

2835.2 --> 2838.64
what a wanker

2836.72 --> 2840.5589999999997
then chooses to add on me about how i

2838.64 --> 2842.4
earn a living because i'm at home when

2840.559 --> 2845.8390000000004
half the world is at the moment

2842.4 --> 2845.839
what a dick

2848.64 --> 2856.0789999999997
then why don't you try to do it you know

2852.24 --> 2856.0789999999997
yeah yeah yeah the point i'll

2856.64 --> 2859.839
be breaking

2863.119 --> 2866.96
we all know he knows scientifically

2865.68 --> 2868.24
paint dries

2866.96 --> 2869.76
now he's telling me he has to come all

2868.24 --> 2870.4799999999996
the way to south africa to make sure my

2869.76 --> 2872.4
paint dries

2870.48 --> 2873.599
that's what he's saying are you still

2872.4 --> 2876.1600000000003
trying to weasel in that you're a paid

2873.599 --> 2876.1600000000003
scientist

2876.4 --> 2879.28
yeah we're the left

2880.16 --> 2884.48
so for those of you in the live show

2882.319 --> 2885.44
just so they're in on the in joke flat

2884.48 --> 2887.359
sword was trying to

2885.44 --> 2889.28
claim he's a paint scientist in the

2887.359 --> 2890.72
pre-show and i defined that as

2889.28 --> 2893.28
pseudoscience but he's still banging

2890.72 --> 2896.16
that drum right flat sword

2893.28 --> 2897.119
i was just joking by the way yeah many a

2896.16 --> 2899.44
true word

2897.119 --> 2900.2400000000002
you think you're scientist which is fair

2899.44 --> 2903.28
man because

2900.24 --> 2904.319
that's it it's very easy you paid

2903.28 --> 2906.1600000000003
scientists

2904.319 --> 2907.44
you just ask somebody hey you want to

2906.16 --> 2910.0
pay me 10

2907.44 --> 2914.2400000000002
euros or something over paypal for me to

2910.0 --> 2914.24
prove that water boils at 100 degrees

2925.28 --> 2928.96
nobody's triggered we're trying to get

2926.88 --> 2932.6400000000003
your words in go ahead

2928.96 --> 2935.92
fatsoid no the the um

2932.64 --> 2936.96
the conversation i was trying to get

2935.92 --> 2939.2000000000003
through to that guy

2936.96 --> 2940.16
was just because i'm here in another

2939.2 --> 2942.8799999999997
country

2940.16 --> 2943.44
and scientifically you know with

2942.88 --> 2945.6800000000003
everything

2943.44 --> 2947.2000000000003
paint does dry it's the same as he's

2945.68 --> 2949.04
saying yes he knows paint dries but he

2947.2 --> 2949.7599999999998
has to come to me to make sure the paint

2949.04 --> 2952.88
dries

2949.76 --> 2954.0
that's how stupid it is yeah i see your

2952.88 --> 2957.6800000000003
point

2954.0 --> 2958.48
uh neil go ahead i was gonna ask how

2957.68 --> 2960.24
many housekeep

2958.48 --> 2961.68
housekeeping questions do we have at the

2960.24 --> 2964.7999999999997
moment uh

2961.68 --> 2966.3999999999996
seven is it or eight

2964.8 --> 2968.2400000000002
okay so the good thing would be for

2966.4 --> 2969.76
somebody to have an answer for these

2968.24 --> 2971.52
housekeeping questions

2969.76 --> 2973.28
until then we're going to keep going on

2971.52 --> 2977.119
and on and on because

2973.28 --> 2978.7200000000003
we have proof and they have assertions

2977.119 --> 2980.88
yeah that's correct but what actually

2978.72 --> 2982.72
happened there was pure projection

2980.88 --> 2985.04
i would prefer you were just one of

2982.72 --> 2986.319
those flat earthers sending balloons up

2985.04 --> 2988.5589999999997
rather than getting me to concede the

2986.319 --> 2989.359
skies not a vacuum it would be much

2988.559 --> 2992.8
better for me

2989.359 --> 2995.5989999999997
if you were just sending balloons up

2992.8 --> 2997.28
that's what that actually means so then

2995.599 --> 2999.44
just go burn some money then

2997.28 --> 3001.119
that's that's the equivalence yeah and

2999.44 --> 3002.8
also his resentment of the fact that me

3001.119 --> 3003.76
pummeling his globe faith actually earns

3002.8 --> 3007.599
me a living

this show to be honest with you

3034.64 --> 3040.72
i'm actually very glad i found this show

3037.599 --> 3042.96
shout out to david weiss

3040.72 --> 3044.24
that reminds me of the last time i've

3042.96 --> 3047.359
done just that

3044.24 --> 3048.64
just one second one second can you

3047.359 --> 3049.68
remind me after the housekeeping

3048.64 --> 3052.0
questions neil

3049.68 --> 3053.5989999999997
uh your shout out to dave weiss i want

3052.0 --> 3055.41
to cover that

3053.599 --> 3056.7200000000003
just remind me go ahead tenth

3055.41 --> 3059.1189999999997
[Music]

3056.72 --> 3059.7599999999998
no i was gonna say in the pre-show i

3059.119 --> 3061.76
said hey

3059.76 --> 3063.119
you know because i had to go yesterday i

3061.76 --> 3065.2000000000003
missed most of the show

3063.119 --> 3066.4
i said hey anything happened on the show

3065.2 --> 3067.839
ah no not really

3066.4 --> 3070.0
and then this guy comes today i'm saying

3067.839 --> 3071.44
that's the last time flat toy then

3070.0 --> 3072.64
neil are going to give me a commentary

3071.44 --> 3075.04
on what happened on the show the day

3072.64 --> 3075.04
before

3075.359 --> 3080.839
nathan i couldn't i don't remember this

3077.92 --> 3083.839
i won't remember this once the show

3080.839 --> 3083.839
finishes

3084.4 --> 3087.44
what are you talking about and hello by

3086.48 --> 3090.8
the way okay

3087.44 --> 3091.52
let's just fill our winnings hello first

3090.8 --> 3094.1600000000003
of all

3091.52 --> 3095.839
we forgot what happened i'm i tend to

3094.16 --> 3097.1189999999997
switch off the moment the show finishes

3095.839 --> 3098.24
and just concentrate on the admin of

3097.119 --> 3100.319
publishing stuff

3098.24 --> 3101.52
but that meant i unless i watch the show

3100.319 --> 3103.2
after the fact i can't really remember

3101.52 --> 3105.04
what happens i'll forget this pretty

3103.2 --> 3107.04
soon after we finish there we go that's

3105.04 --> 3108.0
me and we were asked what happened and

3107.04 --> 3111.2799999999997
we're like i don't know

3108.0 --> 3113.599
um i think ah we had a bit of a set to

3111.28 --> 3115.0400000000004
about one of his models and then stormed

3113.599 --> 3117.119
off before he got pissed off

3115.04 --> 3118.64
came back a bit later that's about it in

3117.119 --> 3121.359
other words nothing happened

3118.64 --> 3123.2
and then the guy who actually conceded

3121.359 --> 3124.5589999999997
space is fake who's a globe believer

3123.2 --> 3126.3999999999996
came in and was like

3124.559 --> 3127.8390000000004
uh you know about you know a space

3126.4 --> 3129.44
that's fake you should be sending up a

3127.839 --> 3130.7999999999997
balloon to debunk it that way

3129.44 --> 3133.44
rather than sitting here debating and

3130.8 --> 3138.1600000000003
earning a living that's what he said

3133.44 --> 3139.92
in summary i mean i'm paraphrasing

3138.16 --> 3141.2799999999997
when you took up you took a thought of

3139.92 --> 3143.6800000000003
the train yesterday

3141.28 --> 3144.96
congratulations well that's just not the

3143.68 --> 3147.2799999999997
case though is it obviously

3144.96 --> 3148.48
so he took even irwin's debate for his

3147.28 --> 3150.3190000000004
model

3148.48 --> 3151.76
which eventually at the conclusion he

3150.319 --> 3152.8
stormed off rather than getting shroppy

3151.76 --> 3154.4
about it which i

3152.8 --> 3156.0
defended you on in the pre-show i win

3154.4 --> 3157.28
they were like oh i went out of mahdi

3156.0 --> 3158.559
i'm like no he didn't

3157.28 --> 3160.2400000000002
he got to the end of the argument and

3158.559 --> 3161.599
then went away rather than getting

3160.24 --> 3163.1189999999997
stroppy about something personal to him

3161.599 --> 3164.559
which was very wise so you got credit

3163.119 --> 3165.359
from me and everyone else was like yeah

3164.559 --> 3166.559
the maddie

3165.359 --> 3168.5589999999997
there you go guys i'm throwing you under

3166.559 --> 3170.6400000000003
the bus for army now you can defend your

3168.559 --> 3172.7200000000003
own horrors

3170.64 --> 3174.0
well i just left because i knew

3172.72 --> 3177.2799999999997
basically one

3174.0 --> 3178.24
my argument and it was cleared up and

3177.28 --> 3180.1600000000003
everything and then

3178.24 --> 3181.9199999999996
yeah i was just too pissed off you know

3180.16 --> 3183.52
so i don't i don't want to throw out

3181.92 --> 3186.079
more rage win for no reason

3183.52 --> 3187.44
exactly that's exactly what i love

3186.079 --> 3188.7200000000003
that's exactly what i said before it

3187.44 --> 3189.839
turned into irwin getting

3188.72 --> 3191.68
actually triggered and obviously now

3189.839 --> 3193.44
i've been triggered he definitely wasn't

3191.68 --> 3194.96
he went away that's very your eyes i

3193.44 --> 3197.76
think

3194.96 --> 3199.04
thank you anyway let's do the rest of

3197.76 --> 3201.119
the housekeeping we just rattle through

3199.04 --> 3203.68
them

3201.119 --> 3205.04
sure any evidence maybe the next level

3203.68 --> 3206.7999999999997
try the next one

3205.04 --> 3209.52
okay any evidence of axial rotation at

3206.8 --> 3213.119
the earth-based variety

3209.52 --> 3218.24
no direction trains ruined thanksgiving

3213.119 --> 3218.2400000000002
more reference frames just one more time

3219.52 --> 3225.28
cannot claim cornealis and conservation

3222.079 --> 3225.28
of momentum at the same breath

3226.079 --> 3230.48
i'm thinking this is a good time to send

3227.839 --> 3230.48
up a balloon

3231.68 --> 3237.839
well go ahead then will the earth be

3234.16 --> 3237.839
rotating underneath that balloon

3238.0 --> 3241.52
i think that's what he's getting at he

3239.599 --> 3244.319
wants to set the balloon

3241.52 --> 3246.0
to see if the if the earth is a globe

3244.319 --> 3247.359
and it's rotating maybe he wants to find

3246.0 --> 3250.16
the horizon

3247.359 --> 3252.4
see if the horizon rises to eye level i

3250.16 --> 3252.3999999999996
don't know

3253.28 --> 3256.96
i was looking for flat swords video but

3255.04 --> 3258.88
i can't scroll up through the chat and i

3256.96 --> 3261.68
can't remember

3258.88 --> 3262.2400000000002
so can i just get somebody somebody to

3261.68 --> 3263.9199999999996
quote

3262.24 --> 3266.0789999999997
simon and then we'll move on to the next

3263.92 --> 3266.079
one

3268.8 --> 3271.92
you you and your reference rhymes have

3270.8 --> 3276.0
been ruined

3271.92 --> 3276.0
perfect any evidence the distance listen

3276.24 --> 3283.18
no no evidence it's all we're not today

3281.04 --> 3284.48
it's over there it's shining bright and

3283.18 --> 3287.5989999999997
[Music]

3284.48 --> 3290.48
yeah i don't know what it is

3287.599 --> 3292.96
and it appears to be there it's not just

3290.48 --> 3292.96
light in the

3293.44 --> 3298.4
yeah it appears to make make you burn if

3296.64 --> 3301.44
you stand long enough

3298.4 --> 3302.2400000000002
under it i don't know i think that more

3301.44 --> 3304.799
has to do with

3302.24 --> 3305.7599999999998
the light hitting my skin rather than

3304.799 --> 3309.7599999999998
any object

3305.76 --> 3309.76
or apparent object being out there

3310.48 --> 3313.839
because they're all wrong i look it up

3312.079 --> 3315.44
and it says that

3313.839 --> 3317.52
you can obtain gas pressure out of

3315.44 --> 3321.839
container because look at the sun

3317.52 --> 3321.839
and look at the stars

3322.72 --> 3326.8799999999997
this is again from the pre-show so a

3324.799 --> 3328.079
quote from some nobodies presumably on

3326.88 --> 3330.079
cora or something

3328.079 --> 3331.599
it's basically saying i appeal in the

3330.079 --> 3335.119
same way thunderfoot did

3331.599 --> 3336.7200000000003
to my idea that these lights in the sky

3335.119 --> 3338.48
are actually burning balls of gas in a

3336.72 --> 3340.16
sky vacuum so when you ask

3338.48 --> 3341.599
how could the sky be a vacuum all the

3340.16 --> 3343.359
gas we breathe would fill it

3341.599 --> 3345.28
i just pointed it and say it's a vacuum

3343.359 --> 3346.5589999999997
and that proves it and when you ask me

3345.28 --> 3347.44
how we can have gas pressure here

3346.559 --> 3348.96
without containment

3347.44 --> 3351.2000000000003
i say check it out we've got gas

3348.96 --> 3353.04
pressure and no containment proving it

3351.2 --> 3355.04
it's just circular reasoning but that

3353.04 --> 3356.64
was the example given by neil and we

3355.04 --> 3359.119
named and shamed the authors in the

3356.64 --> 3359.1189999999997
pre-show

3360.0 --> 3364.319
well what do you think the sun is nathan

3362.4 --> 3366.2400000000002
uh how would i prove it's a burning ball

3364.319 --> 3367.839
of gas in a sky vacuum nail i don't know

3366.24 --> 3370.64
maybe i should get to it maybe i should

3367.839 --> 3370.64
send a balloon up

3371.21 --> 3373.839
[Music]

3372.72 --> 3376.0789999999997
how do you know it's burning in the

3373.839 --> 3378.48
first place we don't know anything about

3376.079 --> 3380.48
it get this intangible object

3378.48 --> 3381.599
because when you zoom in on the

3380.48 --> 3383.839
apparition

3381.599 --> 3386.7200000000003
it kind of looks like you could

3383.839 --> 3389.44
interpret it as something burning

3386.72 --> 3391.68
kind of looks a little fiery i think so

3389.44 --> 3393.2000000000003
we're gonna give off heat

3391.68 --> 3394.72
let's just draw a line into this if you

3393.2 --> 3398.0789999999997
burn things in the atmosphere

3394.72 --> 3400.16
here uh under controlled circumstances

3398.079 --> 3402.559
with spectroscopy you can get a

3400.16 --> 3404.24
signature of the light that is burnt

3402.559 --> 3406.6400000000003
and then you can assert that the light

3404.24 --> 3408.3999999999996
is also burning in the sky vacuum

3406.64 --> 3409.68
and producing the same signature

3408.4 --> 3414.079
therefore

3409.68 --> 3416.839
it is the same by way of cholera uh

3414.079 --> 3418.319
coloration that's the wrong word isn't

3416.839 --> 3419.839
it

3418.319 --> 3421.44
correlation that's the one i was looking

3419.839 --> 3423.359
for it's correlated

3421.44 --> 3424.7200000000003
with the spectroscopy done under

3423.359 --> 3426.0
controlled circumstances

3424.72 --> 3427.5989999999997
so that's where they get their

3426.0 --> 3429.68
information in terms of what they say it

3427.599 --> 3429.6800000000003
is

3430.079 --> 3434.4
moving on hey can i have one one thing

3433.359 --> 3437.5989999999997
real quick we move on

3434.4 --> 3439.6800000000003
feel free thanks good morning guys um

3437.599 --> 3441.44
i know sending the balloon up is absurd

3439.68 --> 3444.16
um but what about like

3441.44 --> 3445.52
an explorer yacht i know i've heard tim

3444.16 --> 3446.72
mention it once or twice

3445.52 --> 3448.88
um i was thinking about doing that

3446.72 --> 3451.2799999999997
myself how do you feel about

3448.88 --> 3452.4
i think i was out there for inspiration

3451.28 --> 3455.3590000000004
i didn't hear the question

3452.4 --> 3456.799
well bennett i got it again he's talking

3455.359 --> 3458.799
about the explorer yacht

3456.799 --> 3460.24
instead of a balloon like navigating the

3458.799 --> 3463.28
oceans on the

3460.24 --> 3465.7599999999998
explorer yacht oh i see go attend

3463.28 --> 3467.119
that looks sounds fun yeah so dude so

3465.76 --> 3470.2400000000002
zeppelins yeah

3467.119 --> 3473.92
freaking zapulins guys come on

3470.24 --> 3475.52
hold on all right go ahead yes uh you

3473.92 --> 3478.079
can get a nice north oven

3475.52 --> 3478.64
that's made to cruise the oceans uh you

3478.079 --> 3480.88
can get

3478.64 --> 3481.7599999999998
a benedi uh there's a nice one coming

3480.88 --> 3482.73
out there's

3481.76 --> 3484.88
that's what he's asking

3482.73 --> 3486.64
[Laughter]

3484.88 --> 3488.1600000000003
right now no you're right about the new

3486.64 --> 3488.96
highlands i love north hopkins but i

3488.16 --> 3491.2799999999997
mean just

3488.96 --> 3493.599
as opposed to sending a balloon up in

3491.28 --> 3493.599
the sky

3496.16 --> 3501.44
okay a balloon would be a lot cheaper

3499.48 --> 3502.799
[Laughter]

3501.44 --> 3504.559
okay but if you're gonna do an

3502.799 --> 3506.4
exploration you're gonna have to have

3504.559 --> 3508.4
crew you're gonna have to have range

3506.4 --> 3510.4
at least eight thousand to sixteen

3508.4 --> 3511.76
thousand mile range so you're talking a

3510.4 --> 3513.839
lot of expense so

3511.76 --> 3516.6400000000003
we're trying to still finish up nathan's

3513.839 --> 3518.64
panels in this studio at the moment

3516.64 --> 3520.8799999999997
but but then don't forget you're just

3518.64 --> 3522.319
gonna have to have

3520.88 --> 3524.1600000000003
the correct papers and stuff for

3522.319 --> 3525.599
different parts of the ocean

3524.16 --> 3527.44
i mean they've got a lot of restrictions

3525.599 --> 3529.76
when you're allowed to go

3527.44 --> 3530.96
listen i got a navigator who's a baller

3529.76 --> 3532.7200000000003
who i follow

3530.96 --> 3534.88
and have been in contact with he doesn't

3532.72 --> 3537.2799999999997
know i'm a flat earther though

3534.88 --> 3539.119
and he would be a guy i would invite if

3537.28 --> 3540.2400000000002
someone was to fund such a trip if

3539.119 --> 3542.799
someone was to fund

3540.24 --> 3544.0789999999997
such a trip it'd be in the millions of

3542.799 --> 3546.96
dollars it would take

3544.079 --> 3548.079
at least five years so yeah if someone

3546.96 --> 3550.96
wants to fund it

3548.079 --> 3552.6400000000003
i can run it at no pay just let me go on

3550.96 --> 3556.319
the journey

3552.64 --> 3559.839
according to people nathan can fund it

3556.319 --> 3561.839
yeah you and your couch speaking of cash

3559.839 --> 3563.839
thank you to rakia life again he says

3561.839 --> 3566.16
happy f happy friday again

3563.839 --> 3567.2799999999997
i support those who are spreading truth

3566.16 --> 3570.0789999999997
rackier life

3567.28 --> 3570.88
this super chat is science no it isn't

3570.079 --> 3573.3590000000004
repeatable

3570.88 --> 3574.6400000000003
natural and anyone can replicate oh how

3573.359 --> 3575.68
sweet thank you very much indeed for the

3574.64 --> 3577.52
super chat

3575.68 --> 3578.96
rackier life really i kind of agree

3577.52 --> 3581.92
that's like a cause and effect

3578.96 --> 3583.44
isn't it him sending you money i don't

3581.92 --> 3585.76
agree with the super chatter

3583.44 --> 3586.64
right but no shout out to del west

3585.76 --> 3589.0400000000004
what's good

3586.64 --> 3590.48
all hail death indeed all hail death is

3589.04 --> 3591.7599999999998
in our chat right now hey death good to

3590.48 --> 3592.88
see you

3591.76 --> 3594.6400000000003
i'm going to come to something about

3592.88 --> 3596.0
death after we finish the housekeeping

3594.64 --> 3599.04
if neil will remind me not that i'm

3596.0 --> 3601.92
going to forget by the looks

3599.04 --> 3603.7599999999998
and you're gonna give us dirt on earth

3601.92 --> 3605.6800000000003
no not at all there is no dirt on death

3603.76 --> 3607.2000000000003
how dare you even suggest such a notion

3605.68 --> 3608.48
no that that that's a pot

3607.2 --> 3610.16
that's the good stuff we're gonna get

3608.48 --> 3611.76
the real dirt on there from you because

3610.16 --> 3614.48
you like dirt

3611.76 --> 3615.599
you don't put any dirt on the boss don't

3614.48 --> 3620.16
you know he's the boss

3615.599 --> 3620.1600000000003
ah it's not dearth it's different

3620.64 --> 3624.5589999999997
nobody says right e-i-t-r-h i was going

3623.68 --> 3626.48
to contact you i never

3624.559 --> 3628.4
just didn't get around to it i was gonna

3626.48 --> 3630.16
my intention although i didn't do this

3628.4 --> 3631.839
on one of the most recent videos it was

3630.16 --> 3634.16
the debate between ed

3631.839 --> 3635.599
and myself about a helicopter not having

3634.16 --> 3638.16
earth turning underneath it at 15

3635.599 --> 3639.839
degrees an hour as is asserted it should

3638.16 --> 3641.44
and my intention although like i said i

3639.839 --> 3644.96
didn't get around to it was to request

3641.44 --> 3646.559
uh dave weiss's footage of a drone

3644.96 --> 3648.2400000000002
just watching the sun because

3646.559 --> 3650.0
effectively that is because

3648.24 --> 3651.359
from memory he's got one that's up there

3650.0 --> 3653.68
for ages

3651.359 --> 3655.119
comes down charges up goes back up again

3653.68 --> 3656.799
but it's just looking at the same spot

3655.119 --> 3658.319
it's essentially in what is claimed to

3656.799 --> 3660.24
be the inertial reference frame with

3658.319 --> 3661.68
earth not turning underneath it

3660.24 --> 3662.8799999999997
it's a really really useful

3661.68 --> 3664.0789999999997
demonstration i just haven't got around

3662.88 --> 3667.44
to asking him

3664.079 --> 3668.559
for the link for it i have the

3667.44 --> 3670.96
demonstration

3668.559 --> 3672.0
so actually validated my balloon

3670.96 --> 3673.839
demonstration

3672.0 --> 3675.44
exactly it's exactly the same as your

3673.839 --> 3678.64
balloon demonstration precisely

3675.44 --> 3679.04
it's the same thing hold on don't drones

3678.64 --> 3681.5989999999997
have

3679.04 --> 3683.2799999999997
auto correct basically if a wind blows

3681.599 --> 3685.76
that they keep themselves in place

3683.28 --> 3687.119
glad you brought it up so let's okay

3685.76 --> 3688.7990000000004
let's assume that that's correct

3687.119 --> 3690.6400000000003
let's go with our win suggestion so it's

3688.799 --> 3691.839
suggested that the drone takes off at

3690.64 --> 3695.52
the equator

3691.839 --> 3697.04
and has got motors and gps tracking

3695.52 --> 3698.799
that could compensate for the fact that

3697.04 --> 3700.48
it's now in a second inertial reference

3698.799 --> 3701.28
frame detached from the earth spinning

3700.48 --> 3703.04
underneath

3701.28 --> 3704.4
so that would suggest that the motors in

3703.04 --> 3706.319
that drone

3704.4 --> 3707.599
can compensate for a thousand miles an

3706.319 --> 3711.44
hour drift

3707.599 --> 3712.6400000000003
are win well not very close to the

3711.44 --> 3714.079
earth's surface

3712.64 --> 3716.0789999999997
uh it's still got to cope with the

3714.079 --> 3718.4
second reference no

3716.079 --> 3720.0
i wasn't claiming that that it corrects

3718.4 --> 3722.0
for choreos that's what a baller would

3720.0 --> 3723.119
do but i do know that they have this

3722.0 --> 3725.76
mechanism

3723.119 --> 3727.52
for sudden wind [ __ ] no not all drones

3725.76 --> 3729.6800000000003
by the way but the the more expensive

3727.52 --> 3732.079
ones do anything david has one of those

3729.68 --> 3733.52
i appreciate it yes i'm sure that's true

3732.079 --> 3734.799
i'm sure it can keep it in the same spot

3733.52 --> 3736.72
relative to the wind and so

3734.799 --> 3738.0
forth if it moves in its location

3736.72 --> 3740.24
compared to gps

3738.0 --> 3742.079
however if it's going to be utilizing

3740.24 --> 3743.4399999999996
that as is often used as a defense when

3742.079 --> 3744.88
they are claiming the drift they

3743.44 --> 3746.799
actually have as their rhetoric

3744.88 --> 3748.0
that would require it to compensate for

3746.799 --> 3750.319
15 degrees

3748.0 --> 3752.4
an hour turn of the earth underneath as

3750.319 --> 3752.88
an as a non-inertial spinning reference

3752.4 --> 3754.4
frame

3752.88 --> 3756.079
well if that was the case then the drone

3754.4 --> 3757.359
would have to compensate for a thousand

3756.079 --> 3759.119
miles an hour

3757.359 --> 3761.2
on the equator so the drone goes up you

3759.119 --> 3762.1600000000003
push the stick it's then in the inertial

3761.2 --> 3764.16
reference frame not

3762.16 --> 3765.52
attached to the spinning reference frame

3764.16 --> 3767.5989999999997
well therefore you're going to watch

3765.52 --> 3769.52
that drone if it's true and we do have

3767.599 --> 3771.119
15 degrees an hour turn of the earth

3769.52 --> 3772.64
underneath as a non-inertial

3771.119 --> 3774.799
spinning reference frame you're going to

3772.64 --> 3776.319
watch it appear to drift away from you

3774.799 --> 3778.48
that means it's actually going to drift

3776.319 --> 3780.88
away from you a thousand miles an hour

3778.48 --> 3782.079
and if you're suggestive that the gps

3780.88 --> 3783.6800000000003
could cope with that it would mean that

3782.079 --> 3784.96
the motors would have to compensate for

3783.68 --> 3786.48
thousand miles an hour

3784.96 --> 3788.16
to keep up with the ground that's moving

3786.48 --> 3789.119
underneath it now i know you're not

3788.16 --> 3790.5589999999997
saying that albin you're just saying

3789.119 --> 3791.839
yeah they can compensate for it moving

3790.559 --> 3793.119
about a bit in the wind

3791.839 --> 3794.24
that's nothing to do with the second

3793.119 --> 3795.039
reference frame that would be turning

3794.24 --> 3797.68
underneath

3795.039 --> 3799.039
if it's true as they claim we have 15

3797.68 --> 3802.24
degrees an hour turn of the earth

3799.039 --> 3804.4
underneath second reference frame

3802.24 --> 3805.2799999999997
all right can i just bring up two points

3804.4 --> 3807.44
so there would be

3805.28 --> 3808.88
clouds moving at a thousand miles an

3807.44 --> 3811.119
hour as well

3808.88 --> 3812.48
and everything else and hey yeah you're

3811.119 --> 3814.6400000000003
gonna feel

3812.48 --> 3815.76
all that there would be constant giant

3814.64 --> 3817.839
gales of winds

3815.76 --> 3818.96
absolutely you're spot on all directions

3817.839 --> 3820.48
of surface winds

3818.96 --> 3821.76
so now we've got multiple directions of

3820.48 --> 3822.96
surface winds which comes up in the

3821.76 --> 3824.1600000000003
rebuttal they say oh no it's all

3822.96 --> 3827.039
travelling together

3824.16 --> 3828.96
number one so no 15 degrees an hour

3827.039 --> 3830.559
deviation then one's not drifting apart

3828.96 --> 3832.2400000000002
from the other at 15 degrees an hour

3830.559 --> 3835.76
then precisely as you claim through

3832.24 --> 3838.319
spins they travel together no drift

3835.76 --> 3839.6800000000003
yeah also absurd you've got multiple

3838.319 --> 3841.0389999999998
directions of surface winds you can look

3839.68 --> 3842.96
up and see clouds moving in different

3841.039 --> 3846.079
directions at the same location

3842.96 --> 3848.559
absolutely absurd maris

3846.079 --> 3849.44
who's one of my patrons shouts out rakia

3848.559 --> 3851.119
life and says

3849.44 --> 3852.48
shout out rocky your life thank you very

3851.119 --> 3854.1600000000003
much for the super chat maris

3852.48 --> 3856.319
really appreciate the support also

3854.16 --> 3858.8799999999997
another shout out to rocky your life

3856.319 --> 3859.7599999999998
happy friday i support those who spread

3858.88 --> 3862.88
truth

3859.76 --> 3864.3190000000004
last super chat prove pseudoscience we

3862.88 --> 3866.7200000000003
can pay the bills

3864.319 --> 3867.52
shout out to david weiss indeed thank

3866.72 --> 3869.2799999999997
you again

3867.52 --> 3870.96
for the hat trick of super chats dave

3869.28 --> 3873.039
rakia gafford or rocky your life

3870.96 --> 3874.64
really appreciate the support we we're

3873.039 --> 3877.599
going to rush through

3874.64 --> 3880.24
nathan also don't also don't forget

3877.599 --> 3881.6800000000003
angular velocity changes with altitude

3880.24 --> 3883.9199999999996
so when you're on the ground it's

3881.68 --> 3884.72
supposed to change 460 meters a second

3883.92 --> 3887.039
on your feet

3884.72 --> 3888.64
so imagine a drone that's let's say a

3887.039 --> 3890.7200000000003
kilometer above it's going to be much

3888.64 --> 3892.96
more than 460 meters a second

3890.72 --> 3894.9599999999996
yeah and all that's coping with is the

3892.96 --> 3896.64
cause of a coriolis deflection

3894.96 --> 3898.319
if there was one so the deflection

3896.64 --> 3899.2799999999997
itself is you on a ground that's

3898.319 --> 3900.72
spinning

3899.28 --> 3902.48
under stuff that isn't that's what gives

3900.72 --> 3904.319
you coriolis so it's

3902.48 --> 3906.16
coined i can't remember by who as being

3904.319 --> 3907.7599999999998
like the coriolis vision

3906.16 --> 3909.2799999999997
because it's not an effect that has

3907.76 --> 3911.2000000000003
anything to do with the momentum the

3909.28 --> 3911.8390000000004
actual trajectory of a projectile you

3911.2 --> 3914.0
watch

3911.839 --> 3916.4
so the drone in this example has got a

3914.0 --> 3918.319
trajectory and movement and power going

3916.4 --> 3919.92
to it to make it go up in the air

3918.319 --> 3921.68
well all of that has sod all to do with

3919.92 --> 3922.0
coriolis deflection because it's only

3921.68 --> 3924.64
ever

3922.0 --> 3925.599
observable by you on a spinning platform

3924.64 --> 3927.2799999999997
so to see it

3925.599 --> 3928.7200000000003
you've got to be spinning underneath it

3927.28 --> 3930.7200000000003
subtle to do with its

3928.72 --> 3932.16
powered flight or otherwise because

3930.72 --> 3934.0789999999997
you're just observing something that

3932.16 --> 3936.0789999999997
seems to drift away from you

3934.079 --> 3937.8390000000004
when it's hovering if earth's turning

3936.079 --> 3938.319
underneath at 15 degrees an hour as they

3937.839 --> 3940.88
claim

3938.319 --> 3942.079
and we simply don't observe that effect

3940.88 --> 3944.079
flat sides balloon

3942.079 --> 3946.559
david weiss's drone they are perfect

3944.079 --> 3948.88
examples the earth is simply not turning

3946.559 --> 3950.7200000000003
underneath these items at 15 degrees an

3948.88 --> 3952.799
hour and it's supposed to

3950.72 --> 3954.5589999999997
they claim it does they claim it turns

3952.799 --> 3956.0
under footballs and bullets

3954.559 --> 3957.6800000000003
and we're supposed to be turning under

3956.0 --> 3958.16
the sun because we're a second reference

3957.68 --> 3960.799
frame

3958.16 --> 3962.0789999999997
15 degrees an hour right bob's claim to

3960.799 --> 3963.68
have proven this right

3962.079 --> 3966.0
they're in my comments at the moment the

3963.68 --> 3967.9199999999996
trolls and they don't want to say

3966.0 --> 3969.28
thanks bob there's just a handful of

3967.92 --> 3971.039
them that have got it as their screen

3969.28 --> 3971.44
name and their immediate reply from me

3971.039 --> 3973.92
is

3971.44 --> 3976.16
quote simon dan you and your reference

3973.92 --> 3977.6800000000003
frames have been ruined

3976.16 --> 3980.0
and who's reference frames we haven't

3977.68 --> 3982.64
got any

3980.0 --> 3984.24
according to ed the reason why we don't

3982.64 --> 3985.359
see it if how could there be any

3984.24 --> 3988.799
deflection

3985.359 --> 3990.88
if there's no course nathan

3988.799 --> 3992.72
then there's no deflection the course

3990.88 --> 3993.92
would be apparent in other words you'd

3992.72 --> 3996.319
see it happening

3993.92 --> 3998.079
it would drift away it's like he's

3996.319 --> 4000.24
asking me why if there's no deflection

3998.079 --> 4002.079
at 15 degrees an hour how can there be

4000.24 --> 4002.799
deflection and then calling me an idiot

4002.079 --> 4004.079
it's like well

4002.799 --> 4006.079
you're telling me there isn't any

4004.079 --> 4008.319
deflection it's not drifting away

4006.079 --> 4009.119
but that should be apparent i you should

4008.319 --> 4011.119
see it happen

4009.119 --> 4012.1600000000003
1000 miles an hour it should drift away

4011.119 --> 4013.839
on the equator

4012.16 --> 4015.2799999999997
apparent meaning it should actually

4013.839 --> 4017.44
happen not

4015.28 --> 4018.3190000000004
not happen and then ask us why it's not

4017.44 --> 4019.68
happening

4018.319 --> 4022.16
earth's supposed to turn underneath at

4019.68 --> 4024.319
15 degrees an hour we're all well

4022.16 --> 4026.0
well aware of this now you know we can

4024.319 --> 4026.96
actually kiss bob and thank him for it

4026.0 --> 4029.039
thank you bob

4026.96 --> 4030.079
everyone's now well aware thanks to bob

4029.039 --> 4033.119
and netflix

4030.079 --> 4034.7200000000003
that it's claimed earth turns underneath

4033.119 --> 4036.2400000000002
at 15 degrees an hour

4034.72 --> 4037.4399999999996
that would shorten flight times and have

4036.24 --> 4038.64
drones whizzing away from you at a

4037.44 --> 4039.76
thousand miles an hour that would be

4038.64 --> 4042.48
apparent

4039.76 --> 4042.48
and isn't

4044.88 --> 4049.359
now but ed what's up i got something for

4047.68 --> 4052.96
you from ed in a

4049.359 --> 4055.839
master bee right but i i wanna

4052.96 --> 4058.0
clarify while people look that up what

4055.839 --> 4059.44
ed really was so frustrated about he got

4058.0 --> 4062.96
so pissed off because

4059.44 --> 4065.68
he was like why are you bringing

4062.96 --> 4066.96
this supposed coriolis deviation of the

4065.68 --> 4069.7599999999998
spinning earth up

4066.96 --> 4072.96
when the helicopter obviously is not

4069.76 --> 4076.559
deviating nathan

4072.96 --> 4078.64
that is really what he was doing i think

4076.559 --> 4080.559
yeah because you could hear it in his

4078.64 --> 4081.2799999999997
voice you could you could hear he

4080.559 --> 4082.799
thought

4081.28 --> 4085.039
he thought he had an opening my bad

4082.799 --> 4088.559
flats right i was like

4085.039 --> 4090.1600000000003
you could hear god

4088.559 --> 4091.6800000000003
apparently there's some ballers trying

4090.16 --> 4092.5589999999997
to get into talk but they say the room

4091.68 --> 4095.5989999999997
is full

4092.559 --> 4099.759
can we make a space for them

4095.599 --> 4102.64
hey the weather is not participating in

4099.759 --> 4104.4
discord get out and let the ball is in

4102.64 --> 4105.92
yeah negotiate with your own bowlers if

4104.4 --> 4107.3589999999995
they're not talking you know

4105.92 --> 4109.359
talk to me i'm running a live show

4107.359 --> 4112.4800000000005
anyway i've got this ed freeze chat up

4109.359 --> 4114.799
arwin you mean when i bursted

4112.48 --> 4115.678999999999
out in laughter because nathan ruined

4114.799 --> 4118.48
himself and

4115.679 --> 4119.359
his strawman reference frames yeah that

4118.48 --> 4121.44
was amazing

4119.359 --> 4123.279
yeah keep debunking your own reference

4121.44 --> 4124.3189999999995
frames you can put it on me all you like

4123.279 --> 4126.56
fundies i'm actually

4124.319 --> 4127.4400000000005
encouraging it from now debunk my

4126.56 --> 4129.4400000000005
summary

4127.44 --> 4130.879999999999
of you and your reference frames that

4129.44 --> 4133.04
dan says are ruined

4130.88 --> 4134.400000000001
feel free to keep debunking when i've

4133.04 --> 4136.159
summarized it

4134.4 --> 4137.5199999999995
and falling into the same trap as dan

4136.159 --> 4139.239
there's a guy in the comment section

4137.52 --> 4140.56
that keeps saying there's like shadow

4139.239 --> 4143.04
949

4140.56 --> 4145.120000000001
where i detail how a guy would drift

4143.04 --> 4146.0
it's like yeah you guys claim drift i'm

4145.12 --> 4148.4
detailing how

4146.0 --> 4149.92
drift occurs and they're saying there

4148.4 --> 4151.44
you go there's your straw man that's

4149.92 --> 4153.1990000000005
my dad's debunking it's like no that's

4151.44 --> 4155.5199999999995
me summarizing your claim

4153.199 --> 4158.0
but feel free to keep debunking it like

4155.52 --> 4160.4800000000005
the idiot simon dan has done

4158.0 --> 4161.44
great kudos my reference frame now i

4160.48 --> 4163.919999999999
don't have any

4161.44 --> 4165.12
but you claim 15 degrees now drift as

4163.92 --> 4167.12
earth turns underneath

4165.12 --> 4168.88
drones and bullets and balls and

4167.12 --> 4169.839
helicopters oh yeah we don't see it

4168.88 --> 4171.759
happen

4169.839 --> 4173.44
that's bad you really don't get these

4171.759 --> 4175.839
ballers why do

4173.44 --> 4176.799
when you were literally lighting

4175.839 --> 4179.6
lighting out

4176.799 --> 4181.12
how simon then did that for so so long

4179.6 --> 4183.839
so intensely

4181.12 --> 4185.839
obviously we laughing about it very hard

4183.839 --> 4188.799
because it's such a stupid mistake

4185.839 --> 4189.2789999999995
why are people following suit why are

4188.799 --> 4192.08
few

4189.279 --> 4194.64
people following him in his tracks like

4192.08 --> 4197.04
he actually solved something

4194.64 --> 4199.76
oh absurd let him head first straight

4197.04 --> 4201.44
into a spike field feces covered trap

4199.76 --> 4204.159000000001
so you want a deep you want to find a

4201.44 --> 4206.719
show where i summarize how drift occurs

4204.159 --> 4208.719
yeah that's me summarizing how you and

4206.719 --> 4209.199
your reference frame describe a 15

4208.719 --> 4212.0
degree

4209.199 --> 4213.678999999999
an hour drift as earth turns underneath

4212.0 --> 4214.159
so you want to debunk me summarizing

4213.679 --> 4216.64
that

4214.159 --> 4218.32
be my guest fall straight into that pit

4216.64 --> 4221.76
with dan

4218.32 --> 4225.5199999999995
great dan and

4221.76 --> 4227.4400000000005
ed they're all doing it at the moment

4225.52 --> 4228.8
you know it's your reference frames okay

4227.44 --> 4231.199
go and then debunk them

4228.8 --> 4232.56
show us how we don't have drift at 15

4231.199 --> 4233.199
degrees now to prove earth turning

4232.56 --> 4235.120000000001
underneath

4233.199 --> 4236.719
you debunk that go ahead be my guest

4235.12 --> 4238.719
well i think

4236.719 --> 4240.96
sorry and dan was first so i think that

4238.719 --> 4243.44
technically he really is a fallacy

4240.96 --> 4245.28
pioneer and the others are following him

4243.44 --> 4248.5599999999995
yeah dan's gonna lead these lemmings

4245.28 --> 4248.5599999999995
straight off the edge of the cliff

4248.719 --> 4252.719
can i call out mr pudding he's

4250.8 --> 4255.1990000000005
challenging me in discord he says i must

4252.719 --> 4259.84
challenge him out so i'm calling him out

4255.199 --> 4259.839999999999
what's up mr

4260.0 --> 4262.8
housekeeping you know

4263.12 --> 4268.64
yeah just want to see if he's a coward

4264.8 --> 4268.64
or not any scientific evidence of

4270.84 --> 4275.4400000000005
gravity

4272.8 --> 4279.12
what's the speed of a gravitational wave

4275.44 --> 4279.12
any scientific evidence on gravity

4281.199 --> 4286.96
would that be if f equals m a or

4284.239 --> 4288.159
e c m script that cause an effect

4286.96 --> 4290.0
relationship established with an

4288.159 --> 4292.0
independent and dependent variable

4290.0 --> 4294.88
validated by systematic experimentation

4292.0 --> 4296.8
or would that be a bit of maths

4294.88 --> 4298.32
should i got nothing sorry any

4296.8 --> 4299.4400000000005
scientific evidence of gravity going

4298.32 --> 4302.48
once

4299.44 --> 4305.759999999999
would be thinking of it as a force

4302.48 --> 4306.5599999999995
count as evidence can we think of it as

4305.76 --> 4308.88
something

4306.56 --> 4310.96
that's definitely not science that's not

4308.88 --> 4314.08
even a phenomena

4310.96 --> 4316.159
hmm yeah then we got a problem

4314.08 --> 4318.32
because the only other thing that's left

4316.159 --> 4320.48
is basic conceptual mediums and yeah

4318.32 --> 4321.92
they they don't have anything empirical

4320.48 --> 4324.799999999999
about them

4321.92 --> 4325.84
to establish science unfortunately let's

4324.8 --> 4328.4800000000005
widen the net a bit

4325.84 --> 4330.88
any single viable hypothesis at all from

4328.48 --> 4333.759999999999
any of the fields of astronomy cosmology

4330.88 --> 4343.12
or astrophysics

4333.76 --> 4346.159000000001
not even from scientology

4343.12 --> 4349.84
no well

4346.159 --> 4352.239
i i want to make a small joke though

4349.84 --> 4353.12
maybe maybe it's in the field but i

4352.239 --> 4355.04
think that

4353.12 --> 4356.32
probably astrophysicists predict

4355.04 --> 4359.36
predicted

4356.32 --> 4360.239
satellite space debris did you see the

4359.36 --> 4363.599999999999
video

4360.239 --> 4364.799999999999
from you what's it what's the special

4363.6 --> 4366.8
what's the satellite where's the

4364.8 --> 4368.320000000001
satellite what space

4366.8 --> 4370.96
and how is debris coming from there if

4368.32 --> 4373.599999999999
it violates natural law

4370.96 --> 4376.4800000000005
but they predicted it and now it's

4373.6 --> 4376.4800000000005
common knowledge

4377.12 --> 4381.36
would that be a mystic meg nostradamus

4379.28 --> 4383.5199999999995
prediction or a scientific prediction

4381.36 --> 4385.839999999999
otherwise known as a hypothesis

4383.52 --> 4387.040000000001
i think it was mostly a mathematical

4385.84 --> 4389.679
prediction

4387.04 --> 4390.88
abstract about conceptual medium and set

4389.679 --> 4393.6
up and all that

4390.88 --> 4395.1990000000005
okay sorry suppositions let's just give

4393.6 --> 4396.84
it clarity then when i say viable

4395.199 --> 4400.5599999999995
hypothesis i mean within

4396.84 --> 4403.28
physics oh yeah

4400.56 --> 4404.400000000001
well that's a dead end then are you

4403.28 --> 4406.08
trying to say

4404.4 --> 4407.599999999999
something that's in a violation of

4406.08 --> 4410.64
nature

4407.6 --> 4412.719
is a problem for another

4410.64 --> 4414.719
thing that's in the violation of nature

4412.719 --> 4418.08
which is not predicted because

4414.719 --> 4421.12
in general no matter where it is

4418.08 --> 4422.96
yes uh super chat day says sean tibbits

4421.12 --> 4424.239
certainly seems to be i'm not moaning

4422.96 --> 4425.6
thank you very much for the super chat

4424.239 --> 4427.199
yeah any evidence so you can have gas

4425.6 --> 4428.159000000001
pressure without a container and as it's

4427.199 --> 4429.678999999999
on screen

4428.159 --> 4431.5199999999995
if it's claimed that this black area is

4429.679 --> 4433.1990000000005
10 to the minus 17 torr

4431.52 --> 4435.4400000000005
vacuum the most powerful machine

4433.199 --> 4436.239
indescribable and this is high pressure

4435.44 --> 4438.08
gas

4436.239 --> 4439.678999999999
not filling it that would be a violation

4438.08 --> 4443.199
of natural law any evidence that you can

4439.679 --> 4443.1990000000005
have gas pressure without a container

4444.8 --> 4448.159000000001
can you have volume without

4445.92 --> 4449.1990000000005
entertainment send the balloon up nathan

4448.159 --> 4454.719
and you will find

4449.199 --> 4457.919999999999
evidence no no no flat sword

4454.719 --> 4459.84
so negator is wrong then

4457.92 --> 4461.12
the gate is wrong they're all very wrong

4459.84 --> 4462.719
they all think the sky's a vacuum

4461.12 --> 4464.96
they're nuts

4462.719 --> 4466.159
yeah they think gas falls down the boom

4464.96 --> 4468.88
boom

4466.159 --> 4470.239
oh shout out to thunderfoot clown gas

4468.88 --> 4471.4400000000005
does not go down go boom boom like

4470.239 --> 4473.28
bouncy balls in a

4471.44 --> 4475.44
fish tank with a single downward vector

4473.28 --> 4477.92
of gravity that's 105 years out of date

4475.44 --> 4479.44
no no no all vectors gas expands in all

4477.92 --> 4480.0
directions to fill the availability of

4479.44 --> 4482.879999999999
volume

4480.0 --> 4485.84
call yourself a phd than footwork clown

4482.88 --> 4488.400000000001
how humiliating

4485.84 --> 4490.8
i still don't know why they insist that

4488.4 --> 4492.96
outer space has to be a vacuum you know

4490.8 --> 4495.92
to let go of the idea that there might

4492.96 --> 4498.08
be a huge amount of volume out there i

4495.92 --> 4500.2390000000005
get that that is very hard but why would

4498.08 --> 4502.32
it have to be a vacuum just because

4500.239 --> 4505.199
the storytelling tradition told them it

4502.32 --> 4507.04
is it could just be a giant amount of

4505.199 --> 4510.0
gas-filled space

4507.04 --> 4511.28
giant who knows they're throwing that

4510.0 --> 4513.6
out the window now as well they don't

4511.28 --> 4516.88
want it to be a vacuum anymore

4513.6 --> 4518.4800000000005
now it's just a very low pressure system

4516.88 --> 4520.8
[Music]

4518.48 --> 4521.678999999999
but it should not even be a very low

4520.8 --> 4524.719
pressure system

4521.679 --> 4526.88
just slightly lower slightly

4524.719 --> 4528.4
yeah okay they say it's 10-17 tour

4526.88 --> 4529.1990000000005
vacuum definitely not the case sky is

4528.4 --> 4532.08
not a vacuum

4529.199 --> 4532.08
hey brian exactly

4532.48 --> 4536.48
hey nathan hey everybody and i just want

4534.4 --> 4537.36
to just want to say a big special hello

4536.48 --> 4541.04
to our resident

4537.36 --> 4542.08
paleontologist flat side painting isn't

4541.04 --> 4543.6
science

4542.08 --> 4546.239
flat side might be good at this job but

4543.6 --> 4546.2390000000005
it's not science

4546.32 --> 4551.12
uh to irwin's statement why

4549.36 --> 4552.799999999999
they don't want to change what outer

4551.12 --> 4553.76
space is well these are the same people

4552.8 --> 4555.52
who say

4553.76 --> 4559.360000000001
the science is settled that at the same

4555.52 --> 4559.360000000001
time say science doesn't prove things

4559.76 --> 4565.360000000001
body of science nathan which brought i

4563.199 --> 4566.96
don't think it's the designers that say

4565.36 --> 4570.719
that that's just the

4566.96 --> 4572.64
public relations figures really

4570.719 --> 4574.64
the talkers on camera say that i don't

4572.64 --> 4577.4400000000005
think that the people actually bending

4574.64 --> 4580.8
over how it's supposed to work

4577.44 --> 4582.639999999999
say that no my it can't

4580.8 --> 4584.2390000000005
my point was if we were there when the

4582.64 --> 4585.84
whoever started this and had these

4584.239 --> 4587.44
housekeeping questions they would say

4585.84 --> 4590.32
that because they want to push

4587.44 --> 4592.08
something without evidence and then

4590.32 --> 4596.799999999999
claim that the way they do it

4592.08 --> 4596.8
is obviously scientific evidence

4596.88 --> 4600.64
like the borders when they had their

4598.88 --> 4602.56
housekeeping questions

4600.64 --> 4605.6
a few months ago which only lasted for

4602.56 --> 4605.6
what a few weeks

4606.0 --> 4611.84
uh one episode

4609.199 --> 4613.199
yeah you're right well they're so

4611.84 --> 4615.04
they're so

4613.199 --> 4617.44
all over the map with their statements

4615.04 --> 4619.6
they even attribute something to

4617.44 --> 4620.879999999999
sir isaac newton that he didn't even

4619.6 --> 4624.400000000001
want it

4620.88 --> 4626.56
attributed to him that's how bad they

4624.4 --> 4626.5599999999995
are

4627.84 --> 4632.0
yeah but it wasn't even fully coherent

4629.44 --> 4632.0
sentences

4637.04 --> 4641.28
at the same time newton technically

4639.12 --> 4644.64
isn't really part

4641.28 --> 4646.8
of the supposed foundation anymore so

4644.64 --> 4648.56
yeah but they used them for

4646.8 --> 4650.719
several hundred years until they didn't

4648.56 --> 4652.400000000001
have a need for them right

4650.719 --> 4654.08
yeah but that's because they were old

4652.4 --> 4656.32
and stupid

4654.08 --> 4657.92
we with our computers are much smarter

4656.32 --> 4661.12
in the modern age

4657.92 --> 4661.12
right right

4661.36 --> 4668.79
right i think that's irrelevant

4665.39 --> 4668.79
[Laughter]

4669.199 --> 4672.799999999999
are we finished housekeeping i i want to

4671.44 --> 4674.0
i want to hear about i want to hear

4672.8 --> 4677.92
about the earth moving

4674.0 --> 4679.679
up what's this general theory relativity

4677.92 --> 4681.52
crap with the earth moving up man

4679.679 --> 4684.4800000000005
i mean this is the new hotness gravity

4681.52 --> 4687.52
right why aren't the groupers in here

4684.48 --> 4688.0
in force on this man come on but they're

4687.52 --> 4691.4400000000005
not

4688.0 --> 4693.199
seeing them they're not

4691.44 --> 4694.96
they're not literally saying it's moving

4693.199 --> 4698.239
up they just say

4694.96 --> 4700.0
you can see it as if

4698.239 --> 4701.759999999999
the motions were the other way around

4700.0 --> 4705.12
it's basically making you thinking

4701.76 --> 4706.96
in the coriolis perspective that you

4705.12 --> 4708.32
think about reference frame and then you

4706.96 --> 4710.0
can inter switch that

4708.32 --> 4711.679
if you just drop the sense in the

4710.0 --> 4712.56
dreaded sensation of falling off a

4711.679 --> 4715.52
building and [ __ ]

4712.56 --> 4716.8
it sounds like pretend yeah you see

4715.52 --> 4719.040000000001
chocolate what they do is

4716.8 --> 4721.28
they take it moving away from an

4719.04 --> 4724.56
anchored euclidean position

4721.28 --> 4727.84
into relative reference frame

4724.56 --> 4730.400000000001
thinking that's exactly what it does

4727.84 --> 4731.84
yeah they take a flat disc and then they

4730.4 --> 4733.28
say you're going upward and because of

4731.84 --> 4734.99
any space hope it's just wrapped around

4733.28 --> 4736.719
the globe

4734.99 --> 4738.08
[Music]

4736.719 --> 4740.96
going straight but you know you're

4738.08 --> 4740.96
looking as you're curving

4741.12 --> 4744.239
it's weird mr veritasium over there

4743.28 --> 4746.0
thinks that

4744.239 --> 4748.08
there are more than one reference frame

4746.0 --> 4749.199
he spoke about numerous reference frames

4748.08 --> 4750.96
in his video

4749.199 --> 4753.678999999999
so whose reference frames again were

4750.96 --> 4756.4
ruined like i'm

4753.679 --> 4757.12
confused let me let me answer that i'll

4756.4 --> 4759.199
address

4757.12 --> 4761.5199999999995
the globe believing fundamentalist

4759.199 --> 4762.96
religious zealots with this statement

4761.52 --> 4765.120000000001
i'm going to take ownership of this

4762.96 --> 4768.4
statement you

4765.12 --> 4773.36
globe believing fundy zealots and

4768.4 --> 4773.36
your reference frames are

4774.84 --> 4779.92
ruined

4777.199 --> 4779.919999999999
thank you very much

4782.0 --> 4786.4
i just reminded you about d-i-t-r-h i

4784.4 --> 4789.28
don't know when you wanted me to but um

4786.4 --> 4790.879999999999
housekeeping i haven't forgotten i i

4789.28 --> 4792.5599999999995
covered the half of what i did

4790.88 --> 4793.76
want to cover already but the other half

4792.56 --> 4795.04
i'll cover after housekeeping any

4793.76 --> 4796.719
evidence of a self-perpetuating

4795.04 --> 4800.239
maltanine core at the center of a

4796.719 --> 4802.88
presupposed spherical earth

4800.239 --> 4805.839999999999
i think it is oh i need your

4802.88 --> 4805.84
imaginations

4807.199 --> 4812.638999999999
only in the books that they made up

4809.76 --> 4812.639
those guys

4814.0 --> 4819.84
not all fat any evidence the r value

4816.239 --> 4819.839999999999
earth radius

4827.12 --> 4830.239
i think that's it that concludes

4830.719 --> 4833.84
whoever that was

4835.36 --> 4838.639
it was just me saying no there was no

4837.12 --> 4840.48
okay no yeah well that concludes the

4838.639 --> 4843.76
housekeeping for certain then

4840.48 --> 4845.678999999999
okay so i'm currently stood on the main

4843.76 --> 4848.4800000000005
channel that's nathan oakley 1980 at

4845.679 --> 4850.32
19 000 subscribers now obviously i'd

4848.48 --> 4851.199
love to hit the milestone of 20 000

4850.32 --> 4852.96
subscribers

4851.199 --> 4855.599999999999
so i started to research how do you grow

4852.96 --> 4857.76
subscribers and what did i come across

4855.6 --> 4859.76
i came across a lot of very attractive

4857.76 --> 4860.56
females much much younger than myself

4859.76 --> 4864.159000000001
twerking

4860.56 --> 4866.639
for subs and things like that and

4864.159 --> 4868.4
upon finding out the various ways that

4866.639 --> 4869.28
other people appeal to their audience to

4868.4 --> 4870.638999999999
subscribe

4869.28 --> 4872.639
i didn't think any of them were very

4870.639 --> 4873.679
applicable to me so i then went back

4872.639 --> 4875.4400000000005
through my stats

4873.679 --> 4877.84
and wrapped my brain which brings me to

4875.44 --> 4879.759999999999
you neil mentioning dearth

4877.84 --> 4881.92
about how i have actually grown the

4879.76 --> 4884.0
channel now whether or not this channel

4881.92 --> 4885.36
shadow banned by youtube or shove down

4884.0 --> 4886.88
the list is irrelevant

4885.36 --> 4888.799999999999
there is a very distinct way that i've

4886.88 --> 4890.56
grown the channel and that's from people

4888.8 --> 4892.719
actually mentioning me

4890.56 --> 4894.56
like dearth so the only reason we have

4892.719 --> 4896.4800000000005
the delta tones of neil on an almost

4894.56 --> 4896.88
daily basis is because dearth mentioned

4896.48 --> 4900.0
me

4896.88 --> 4901.28
and then he came and subscribed uh i

4900.0 --> 4903.679
think you might have also said the same

4901.28 --> 4905.04
about uh globe busters

4903.679 --> 4906.88
the guys from england that might have

4905.04 --> 4909.36
been 10th man

4906.88 --> 4910.96
yeah that was me right well those are

4909.36 --> 4913.92
the places that i see growth

4910.96 --> 4915.04
same goes for eddie eddie and various

4913.92 --> 4916.0
other people who've shouted me out that

4915.04 --> 4917.5199999999995
have got bigger names

4916.0 --> 4918.8
that i've cut out and used at the

4917.52 --> 4920.0
beginning of videos because they could

4918.8 --> 4922.0
shout outs

4920.0 --> 4923.44
however the same applies to almost

4922.0 --> 4925.84
anybody who's watching that's got

4923.44 --> 4928.0
even the remotest of audiences you know

4925.84 --> 4929.679
a shout out from somebody or maybe even

4928.0 --> 4931.04
like some people do already trim out a

4929.679 --> 4932.4800000000005
little clip that they think is relevant

4931.04 --> 4934.0
to the subject matter

4932.48 --> 4936.0
and yeah publish it with a link to my

4934.0 --> 4937.679
channel because that's the only way

4936.0 --> 4939.52
i can see that this channel actually

4937.679 --> 4940.56
grows now it might be optimistic to

4939.52 --> 4942.320000000001
think i can get to

4940.56 --> 4944.4800000000005
20 000 subscribers by the end of the

4942.32 --> 4945.84
year but i know based on my stats and

4944.48 --> 4947.12
where they're going i'm going to hit 5

4945.84 --> 4949.04
million views

4947.12 --> 4950.4
by the end of the year which is a fairly

4949.04 --> 4950.88
astonishing achievement when you think

4950.4 --> 4953.12
about it

4950.88 --> 4955.12
this is still a very very small channel

4953.12 --> 4955.679
and it's all very small increments of

4955.12 --> 4957.84
growth

4955.679 --> 4959.04
but as i say that's what i'm appealing

4957.84 --> 4960.8
to the audience for

4959.04 --> 4963.5199999999995
the only way i can see well unless you

4960.8 --> 4966.96
want to see me twerking for subs

4963.52 --> 4968.159000000001
is that you shout me out i mean

4966.96 --> 4970.4
i'm not getting i'm not going to twerk

4968.159 --> 4971.759999999999
for subs but i will appeal to my

4970.4 --> 4973.28
audience to say you know if you can

4971.76 --> 4975.12
shout me out even if you've got a small

4973.28 --> 4976.5599999999995
audience and by small audience

4975.12 --> 4977.84
like you know if you've got 100 people

4976.56 --> 4978.8
subscribed to you that's an audience of

4977.84 --> 4980.56
100 people

4978.8 --> 4982.639
where you know if you get one percent

4980.56 --> 4983.76
take up that means i grow by one sub

4982.639 --> 4985.679
and if you can chat me out and the

4983.76 --> 4987.280000000001
audience can be increased

4985.679 --> 4989.52
the effectiveness of what we do here is

4987.28 --> 4992.32
increased the potential for more live

4989.52 --> 4993.280000000001
participants has increased also the

4992.32 --> 4996.799999999999
panel okay

4993.28 --> 4999.759999999999
so there's a lot of things gone

4996.8 --> 5000.88
shout out to nation yeah but i'm more

4999.76 --> 5002.320000000001
appealing to people who've actually got

5000.88 --> 5003.76
an audience to

5002.32 --> 5006.08
pass the information on so it's only

5003.76 --> 5008.0
when it's put in front of somebody that

5006.08 --> 5010.0
it wouldn't already be in front of

5008.0 --> 5011.52
now that could be the example with 10th

5010.0 --> 5012.56
man with bob saying the guys out in the

5011.52 --> 5014.080000000001
uk and him going oh

5012.56 --> 5016.159000000001
what guy's in the uk or death

5014.08 --> 5018.0
specifically talking about me

5016.159 --> 5020.0
or eddie bravo specifically talking

5018.0 --> 5020.719
about me there's been growth as a direct

5020.0 --> 5022.88
result of that

5020.719 --> 5024.2390000000005
well it's not growth because i'm lucky

5022.88 --> 5025.84
enough to have one of my videos stuffed

5024.239 --> 5026.799999999999
on the front page of youtube to reach an

5025.84 --> 5029.360000000001
audience that didn't

5026.8 --> 5030.639
already know about me it's only when

5029.36 --> 5033.04
people who

5030.639 --> 5035.12
uh share my stuff in whatever means that

5033.04 --> 5036.639
is reach somebody that hasn't heard of

5035.12 --> 5038.719
me that i will grow that's the

5036.639 --> 5040.400000000001
literally as far as i can ascertain the

5038.719 --> 5042.639
only way the channel grows

5040.4 --> 5043.5199999999995
hence i say it at the beginning of every

5042.639 --> 5045.12
single show

5043.52 --> 5046.719
please share the show it'll increase the

5045.12 --> 5048.08
live audience but it'll also increase

5046.719 --> 5049.92
the diversity of the panel

5048.08 --> 5052.08
and i couldn't be more sincere when i

5049.92 --> 5053.84
say that's why i say every single show

5052.08 --> 5056.32
but like i say when i've looked at the

5053.84 --> 5057.360000000001
stats what directly correlates with

5056.32 --> 5059.44
growth is where

5057.36 --> 5060.639
another youtuber said nathan's a good

5059.44 --> 5062.719
show go and watch him

5060.639 --> 5064.56
and that causes me to grow so if i can't

5062.719 --> 5066.2390000000005
twerk for subs the only thing i can do

5064.56 --> 5069.120000000001
is appeal to other people who've got

5066.239 --> 5070.959999999999
viewers even if it's a small number or a

5069.12 --> 5073.36
perceived small number

5070.96 --> 5075.84
give me a shout out i'll ebag for shout

5073.36 --> 5079.04
outs rather than twerking for subs

5075.84 --> 5079.52
do you know to me have you ever thought

5079.04 --> 5081.36
of

5079.52 --> 5083.1990000000005
you know those advertisements on silent

5081.36 --> 5084.4
buses and stuff never thought of one of

5083.199 --> 5088.4
those

5084.4 --> 5092.08
adverts on what side of the buses or

5088.4 --> 5094.239
billboards uh i mean i could

5092.08 --> 5095.5199999999995
if you're just trying to raise awareness

5094.239 --> 5097.678999999999
i think those are excellent

5095.52 --> 5099.280000000001
means of doing it and speaking of

5097.679 --> 5100.719
raising awareness with billboards and

5099.28 --> 5102.8
things of that nature that's precisely

5100.719 --> 5106.32
something that ditrh has done

5102.8 --> 5108.8
and when he did have a small

5106.32 --> 5110.639
direction to to as an instruction or a

5108.8 --> 5112.320000000001
call to action which those again need to

5110.639 --> 5114.0
have if they're going to be effective

5112.32 --> 5115.679
he was directing people towards flat

5114.0 --> 5117.84
earth clues at the time

5115.679 --> 5119.76
now don't get me wrong if there was a

5117.84 --> 5121.84
sponsored billboard campaign that

5119.76 --> 5124.159000000001
directed people to flat earth debate

5121.84 --> 5125.6
as opposed to flat earth clues you know

5124.159 --> 5126.0
that would be wonderful but i'm not in

5125.6 --> 5127.84
any way

5126.0 --> 5129.92
suggesting that nor can i afford to put

5127.84 --> 5131.76
a billboard campaign together

5129.92 --> 5133.1990000000005
even if i did it would be effective only

5131.76 --> 5136.4800000000005
in my very limited area

5133.199 --> 5136.48
so i don't think it would be a great

5138.84 --> 5141.84
idea

5148.8 --> 5152.56
yeah okay i go instead of flat side this

5151.12 --> 5154.88
time um

5152.56 --> 5156.080000000001
yeah i have no idea what about if you

5154.88 --> 5158.88
made a video

5156.08 --> 5160.4
detailing who you were what you do and

5158.88 --> 5162.400000000001
detailing some of the people

5160.4 --> 5163.759999999999
that come onto your show i'm talking

5162.4 --> 5167.36
about like qe

5163.76 --> 5169.360000000001
and dr john d and adam

5167.36 --> 5170.88
and who they are and they're creating

5169.36 --> 5172.719
just some of their credentials

5170.88 --> 5174.56
and other people that come onto the show

5172.719 --> 5176.4800000000005
maybe like dave rakia he has he has

5174.56 --> 5177.04
credentials in uh some i'm not sure what

5176.48 --> 5178.799999999999
dave

5177.04 --> 5180.4
does by some form of engineering and

5178.8 --> 5182.96
different things like that so

5180.4 --> 5183.679
and ask people to share just a video

5182.96 --> 5186.159
just maybe

5183.679 --> 5188.159
10 minutes long or something just ask

5186.159 --> 5191.759999999999
other channels to mirror and share it

5188.159 --> 5193.679
out there uh so for people to

5191.76 --> 5195.360000000001
see that flat out does not load the

5193.679 --> 5197.36
people wearing tinfoil hats

5195.36 --> 5198.5599999999995
that there's people involved in flat out

5197.36 --> 5201.04
who are not

5198.56 --> 5202.2390000000005
like just sitting in in their bedrooms

5201.04 --> 5203.92
all day

5202.239 --> 5207.04
you know there's people who have careers

5203.92 --> 5208.4
and who are who are actual scientists

5207.04 --> 5210.239
and people who work in engineering and

5208.4 --> 5213.12
different things like that

5210.239 --> 5213.919999999999
you know even yeah you're like that kind

5213.12 --> 5216.0
of thing i just think

5213.92 --> 5217.679
yeah it's a bit kind of butlin's

5216.0 --> 5218.88
introduction to the crew at butlins

5217.679 --> 5222.84
though isn't it

5218.88 --> 5224.0
stars appear on the screen and quantum

5222.84 --> 5225.679
eraser

5224.0 --> 5226.96
i know what you're saying but what

5225.679 --> 5228.2390000000005
you're saying is put together an advert

5226.96 --> 5231.04
that someone can just mirror

5228.239 --> 5232.0
well yeah i had thought of that and i

5231.04 --> 5235.04
considered it

5232.0 --> 5237.44
but it's like if i'd done that and say

5235.04 --> 5240.08
for the sake of argument eddie bravo

5237.44 --> 5240.638999999999
had mirrored it on some obscure channel

5240.08 --> 5243.04
what would

5240.639 --> 5244.32
what i would have done no good but in

5243.04 --> 5247.44
conversation

5244.32 --> 5249.599999999999
with santos santos bernarche saying

5247.44 --> 5251.28
nathan just rocks or destroys or

5249.6 --> 5253.6
whatever word you use i forget now

5251.28 --> 5254.32
that's far more effective so in whatever

5253.6 --> 5257.360000000001
way is

5254.32 --> 5258.799999999999
easy and you know for whatever person so

5257.36 --> 5259.839999999999
let's say you've got 100 subs on your

5258.8 --> 5261.6
channel and you're like

5259.84 --> 5263.4400000000005
i'll just trim out a little bit of this

5261.6 --> 5265.84
particular video it's dead easy

5263.44 --> 5267.36
and then you know if it's just a comment

5265.84 --> 5268.719
underneath or something in the info box

5267.36 --> 5269.5199999999995
saying go and subscribe to nathan like

5268.719 --> 5271.04
get him to 20

5269.52 --> 5273.52
000 subs because that's literally what

5271.04 --> 5275.28
i'm appealing to to people to achieve

5273.52 --> 5276.96
so why not be overt about it so yeah

5275.28 --> 5278.239
that's exactly what i'm asking you to do

5276.96 --> 5279.76
i'm not going to beat around the bush

5278.239 --> 5280.239
that's what i'm trying to achieve i

5279.76 --> 5281.92
think it's

5280.239 --> 5283.36
lofty order i think it's a tall order i

5281.92 --> 5284.159
don't think i'll actually achieve it i'm

5283.36 --> 5286.4
a bit

5284.159 --> 5287.36
skeptical but by the same token if you

5286.4 --> 5288.4
don't try these things you're never

5287.36 --> 5289.5199999999995
going to achieve anything and no one

5288.4 --> 5290.0
will ever shout you out if you don't say

5289.52 --> 5291.360000000001
hey

5290.0 --> 5292.88
can you shout me out you've got a

5291.36 --> 5294.4
channel right you've got a hundred subs

5292.88 --> 5297.4400000000005
yeah shout me out go on

5294.4 --> 5297.44
i might get some out of it

5299.36 --> 5304.159
well did you ever think you were gonna

5300.96 --> 5306.32
achieve the amount of subs you have now

5304.159 --> 5308.48
yeah i thought i'd have a million by now

5306.32 --> 5311.759999999999
what are you talking about

5308.48 --> 5314.32
oh my bad in my bed so much

5311.76 --> 5314.320000000001
from my list

5314.8 --> 5318.159000000001
i'm very pleased with where i am i mean

5316.88 --> 5320.56
rather

5318.159 --> 5321.44
rather than doing the twerking stuff

5320.56 --> 5323.679
which is a joke

5321.44 --> 5325.28
you either do a rap song like chocolate

5323.679 --> 5326.88
you'll get subs

5325.28 --> 5328.159
it's not about me producing more

5326.88 --> 5329.28
material though because where am i going

5328.159 --> 5330.5599999999995
to appeal to i'm going to appeal to the

5329.28 --> 5333.5199999999995
audience i've already got

5330.56 --> 5335.4400000000005
statistically you're i think i can't

5333.52 --> 5337.280000000001
remember the exact it's basically 80 20

5335.44 --> 5338.48
subscribed not subscribed or given the

5337.28 --> 5340.159
amount of trolls i know aren't

5338.48 --> 5341.678999999999
subscribed there's a very small

5340.159 --> 5342.5599999999995
percentage of people who are coming to

5341.679 --> 5344.4800000000005
my videos

5342.56 --> 5346.719
that aren't subscribed already you know

5344.48 --> 5350.799999999999
when i see people who've got a million

5346.719 --> 5352.159
two three four million uh subscribers

5350.8 --> 5353.84
and putting out videos that are getting

5352.159 --> 5354.5599999999995
tens of millions of views with memes or

5353.84 --> 5355.6
something

5354.56 --> 5358.080000000001
they often put at the beginning of their

5355.6 --> 5359.92
video check out my stats only ten

5358.08 --> 5361.5199999999995
percent of you are subscribed

5359.92 --> 5363.12
so they've got the complete antithesis

5361.52 --> 5364.159000000001
of my problem which is that they've got

5363.12 --> 5366.0
a hardly

5364.159 --> 5367.12
nobody's dedicated to meme video so

5366.0 --> 5368.239
hardly anyone subscribes and

5367.12 --> 5370.239
proportionately they've still got

5368.239 --> 5372.0
several million subscribers

5370.239 --> 5373.44
but they're moaning about not having you

5372.0 --> 5374.88
know a dedicated audience

5373.44 --> 5376.96
me i've got nothing but a dedicated

5374.88 --> 5379.12
audience so if i put an advert

5376.96 --> 5380.56
it will be you know i'm preaching to the

5379.12 --> 5382.88
converted

5380.56 --> 5383.76
whereas the converted who are converted

5382.88 --> 5385.6
already

5383.76 --> 5388.08
have potentially got an audience that

5385.6 --> 5390.4800000000005
aren't already catered to by me

5388.08 --> 5391.5199999999995
and how can i get to that audience well

5390.48 --> 5393.04
through the people who are already

5391.52 --> 5393.76
subscribed that may have an audience of

5393.04 --> 5395.36
their own

5393.76 --> 5397.92
now in the case of obviously if i just

5395.36 --> 5400.239
appeal it's a bit cheesy if i just say

5397.92 --> 5401.04
hey bob and dirth can you make me an

5400.239 --> 5403.5199999999995
advert

5401.04 --> 5405.679
i just sound like a weasel whereas if

5403.52 --> 5408.96
it's like well no actually

5405.679 --> 5410.56
utilizing the success although it's

5408.96 --> 5412.08
limited of this channel if you've got

5410.56 --> 5413.4400000000005
100 subs or something

5412.08 --> 5414.8
i mean don't get me wrong if death was

5413.44 --> 5416.4
to make me an advert off the back of

5414.8 --> 5417.4400000000005
this i'd be kissing his ass forever

5416.4 --> 5418.799999999999
but that's not exactly what i'm

5417.44 --> 5420.159
appealing to i'm feeling to anybody

5418.8 --> 5420.8
who's got an audience at all it's like

5420.159 --> 5423.199
you know

5420.8 --> 5423.1990000000005
why not

5425.199 --> 5430.159
well what's up there one merchandise

5428.159 --> 5431.199
wasn't there one time a rap a few

5430.159 --> 5434.239
rappers who were

5431.199 --> 5437.12
uh being noticed on uh youtube

5434.239 --> 5439.36
and internet searches for saying flat

5437.12 --> 5439.36
earth

5440.56 --> 5444.320000000001
yeah it's happened a few times yeah

5443.04 --> 5448.4
right so

5444.32 --> 5451.28
yeah tyson how to deal with them i know

5448.4 --> 5451.28
what you're talking about

5452.32 --> 5457.349999999999
sorry guys so chocolate could uh be the

5455.6 --> 5461.110000000001
ambassador for the rap

5457.35 --> 5461.110000000001
[Laughter]

5461.12 --> 5466.0
i know what you can group yeah i don't

5463.04 --> 5466.0
know what you can do nathan

5467.52 --> 5472.4800000000005
shoot tell me in just photo

5470.639 --> 5474.32
when you see some reporter talking

5472.48 --> 5477.599999999999
somewhere just go behind there with your

5474.32 --> 5479.5199999999995
flatter debate

5477.6 --> 5481.04
that's a great idea chocolate saying

5479.52 --> 5483.76
doing a wrap

5481.04 --> 5485.199
promoting people to watch nathan oakley

5483.76 --> 5488.320000000001
1980

5485.199 --> 5491.44
get on it chocolate

5488.32 --> 5494.32
his rap is already promoted what yeah

5491.44 --> 5495.12
i would say would definitely share the

5494.32 --> 5496.08
show

5495.12 --> 5497.76
let's get that clear there's no

5496.08 --> 5499.44
obligation for anyone to do anything at

5497.76 --> 5501.12
all i'm just saying i'm throwing out

5499.44 --> 5502.799999999999
ideas because i know that i'm never

5501.12 --> 5505.04
going to be twerking for subs

5502.8 --> 5505.04
so

5508.4 --> 5512.239
i have a good idea i have a good idea

5510.639 --> 5514.8
that's really down your lane

5512.239 --> 5515.28
basically utilizing your talents which

5514.8 --> 5517.360000000001
is

5515.28 --> 5518.8
mauling ballers that's what we all love

5517.36 --> 5521.199
you so much for

5518.8 --> 5523.1990000000005
mauling them with arguments an attitude

5521.199 --> 5525.759999999999
a good attitude strict attitude

5523.199 --> 5527.36
so what if you do a marathon like

5525.76 --> 5529.84
especially invite

5527.36 --> 5531.839999999999
the ballers the annoying ones and all

5529.84 --> 5535.360000000001
giving them a

5531.84 --> 5537.12
how long you can hold it up

5535.36 --> 5538.48
you know what that's such a good idea i

5537.12 --> 5541.12
might do it daily

5538.48 --> 5542.879999999999
i could call it flat earth debate i

5541.12 --> 5545.36
already do that

5542.88 --> 5546.0
okay okay well that's what i said like

5545.36 --> 5548.719
if you have like

5546.0 --> 5550.639
a non-stop live marathon let's say four

5548.719 --> 5554.96
more hours

5550.639 --> 5554.96
24 hour marathon it's just an appeal

5555.84 --> 5559.4400000000005
you guys have a problem the live show's

5558.0 --> 5560.0
coming to an end appeal for four more

5559.44 --> 5562.48
hours

5560.0 --> 5562.48
i get it

5563.76 --> 5568.0
guys i've got a problem the ballers are

5565.199 --> 5568.0
too scared at all

5568.4 --> 5571.92
yeah that's that's that's true they

5570.159 --> 5573.12
don't come on no more when they do you

5571.92 --> 5577.6
get the likes of

5573.12 --> 5577.599999999999
ed freeze and he debunks himself

5578.0 --> 5581.6
yeah well let's get him on zanik and

5580.08 --> 5585.76
chiki and rumpus

5581.6 --> 5587.84
and ed all of them well come on

5585.76 --> 5589.12
it should be someone that wants to talk

5587.84 --> 5590.56
they become footnotes haven't they so

5589.12 --> 5592.88
they get edited down

5590.56 --> 5594.159000000001
and then stuffed out after the fact on

5592.88 --> 5596.08
qe's channel

5594.159 --> 5597.36
to show how humiliating it is it's nice

5596.08 --> 5598.8
to reminisce but

5597.36 --> 5601.199
yeah that's why they don't come back

5598.8 --> 5604.400000000001
because they get annihilated obviously

5601.199 --> 5606.96
at the time they claim victory but

5604.4 --> 5607.92
with reflection and constant publication

5606.96 --> 5610.719
you're not gonna

5607.92 --> 5612.159
if you don't realize it you're thick so

5610.719 --> 5613.36
they're gonna realize how badly they've

5612.159 --> 5614.4
been destroyed

5613.36 --> 5617.599999999999
even though at the time they're going

5614.4 --> 5619.839999999999
i'm doing really well

5617.6 --> 5621.92
you mean like the guy who came yesterday

5619.84 --> 5623.84
and conceded to natural law in the

5621.92 --> 5625.52
vacuum against air pressure came back

5623.84 --> 5629.04
today and tried to get us to

5625.52 --> 5630.96
send up a balloon that kind of well yeah

5629.04 --> 5632.48
the guy that's gone from let's go check

5630.96 --> 5634.0
out these absurd flat earthers too hang

5632.48 --> 5635.28
on this doesn't work

5634.0 --> 5637.04
well he's like we discussed at the

5635.28 --> 5639.5199999999995
beginning of the show somebody who's

5637.04 --> 5641.199
stepped into cognitive dissonance well

5639.52 --> 5643.120000000001
that's one path on the road right

5641.199 --> 5644.719
not everyone's but for a lot of people

5643.12 --> 5645.599999999999
who come here if not most of them on the

5644.719 --> 5648.32
globe side

5645.6 --> 5649.04
that's where they're at welcome one and

5648.32 --> 5650.159
all

5649.04 --> 5651.6

5650.159 --> 5653.5199999999995

the name of the show the ballroom neil

5710.639 --> 5715.84
when they come to your ball they're

5712.0 --> 5715.84
still going to dance around the issues

5717.76 --> 5721.84
they're just going to come with a very

5719.679 --> 5723.52
large chamber where people dance and all

5721.84 --> 5729.84
that you do realize that right

5723.52 --> 5729.84
is that a uh

5744.24 --> 5748.07
[Laughter]

5750.159 --> 5755.04
i think you would do a good rap

5752.0 --> 5756.96
promoting nathan oakley 1980.

5755.04 --> 5758.56
man if i had your skills i'd be all over

5756.96 --> 5760.719
it yeah what european

5758.56 --> 5762.88
he's already done that what yeah well

5760.719 --> 5763.199
neil is reiterating it's the same thing

5762.88 --> 5764.4800000000005
so

5763.199 --> 5768.159
chocolate's got have you got a channel

5764.48 --> 5770.159
chocolate i've got a channel have you

5768.159 --> 5771.759999999999
yeah i have a youtube channel yeah how

5770.159 --> 5773.44
many subscribers

5771.76 --> 5775.84
how many subs yeah like a hundred

5773.44 --> 5776.32
dollars perfect steel's making my point

5775.84 --> 5778.08
for me

5776.32 --> 5780.32
saying you're the kind of guy that you

5778.08 --> 5782.8
could not necessarily make a wrap

5780.32 --> 5784.32
but you could trim a little bit out and

5782.8 --> 5785.52
put a link underneath and say go

5784.32 --> 5786.159
subscribe to nathan and then there's

5785.52 --> 5787.52
potentially

5786.159 --> 5789.759999999999
one of the hundred people who've

5787.52 --> 5790.320000000001
subscribed to you that aren't subscribed

5789.76 --> 5792.159000000001
to me

5790.32 --> 5793.44
i might gain one sub it takes some

5792.159 --> 5794.799999999999
effort on your part there's no

5793.44 --> 5796.879999999999
obligation whatsoever

5794.8 --> 5798.4800000000005
but you're exactly who i'm appealing to

5796.88 --> 5800.0
chocolate even though you're obviously

5798.48 --> 5801.599999999999
one of my panel members so

5800.0 --> 5804.719
that doesn't seem to make any sense but

5801.6 --> 5807.04
it does thank you neil

5804.719 --> 5807.92
hey i hashtag your show with every early

5807.04 --> 5810.88
bird show

5807.92 --> 5812.96
i mean no doubt cause honestly i never

5810.88 --> 5813.679
thought i would make any type of content

5812.96 --> 5817.04
at all

5813.679 --> 5818.96
so just i mean i'm not making a show but

5817.04 --> 5820.48
even just putting a rap song out there

5818.96 --> 5822.4
for me that was big because

5820.48 --> 5824.5599999999995
i never planned on making anything to

5822.4 --> 5826.799999999999
put out there in the first place

5824.56 --> 5826.8
so

5838.4 --> 5842.48
you said he wanted to share it so i

5840.88 --> 5844.88
don't know if he has or not but

5842.48 --> 5846.0
yeah that'd be cool he had a talk and

5844.88 --> 5848.88
that's cool because

5846.0 --> 5850.239
somebody regular some regular do like me

5848.88 --> 5852.4800000000005
making a song and then

5850.239 --> 5853.759999999999
somebody like jiren would like i don't

5852.48 --> 5854.799999999999
know what does he have like a hundred

5853.76 --> 5857.360000000001
and fifty

5854.8 --> 5859.76
thousand subs or something like that

5857.36 --> 5861.5199999999995
like that's basically

5859.76 --> 5864.2390000000005
all right that's pretty good so shout

5861.52 --> 5864.2390000000005
out to jiren too

5865.199 --> 5871.599999999999
nathan yeah 2015 did

5869.6 --> 5874.2390000000005
uh did a kind of a documentary piece

5871.6 --> 5877.92
with with voice

5874.239 --> 5881.04
with what voice remember our channel

5877.92 --> 5883.04
voice documentaries remember

5881.04 --> 5884.56
you back in 2015 they did a piece on

5883.04 --> 5886.159
flat earth and you were one in a million

5884.56 --> 5888.320000000001
people in it

5886.159 --> 5889.28
oh on on vice versa i did an interview

5888.32 --> 5892.4
yes i'd actually do

5889.28 --> 5892.4
two but one of them

5893.44 --> 5896.0
yeah yeah why would you reach out to

5894.8 --> 5897.84
them and say that they want to do a

5896.0 --> 5899.28
second piece

5897.84 --> 5901.119000000001
no they reach out to me in both

5899.28 --> 5902.4
instances they reached out to me about

5901.119 --> 5904.799999999999
the first piece

5902.4 --> 5906.879999999999
i got to i built a rapport with the the

5904.8 --> 5910.0
woman who actually produced it

5906.88 --> 5911.4400000000005
and she then got in touch again after

5910.0 --> 5914.56
i'd done that and it was published and

5911.44 --> 5918.08
successful to do a roundup of the year

5914.56 --> 5920.56
in 2016 i think it was and we filmed it

5918.08 --> 5921.76
but it wasn't great i even i knew that

5920.56 --> 5924.080000000001
when we were filming it

5921.76 --> 5925.1990000000005
there was a fairly obnoxious quote

5924.08 --> 5926.639
ethical hacker

5925.199 --> 5929.119
that was one of the pamela members and

5926.639 --> 5932.159000000001
she was like totally triggered

5929.119 --> 5933.92
sjw just annoying

5932.159 --> 5935.5199999999995
and it just ruined the feel of the whole

5933.92 --> 5936.88
piece so they said that when they tried

5935.52 --> 5938.159000000001
to edit it together it just didn't work

5936.88 --> 5939.76
and i thought yeah shocker

5938.159 --> 5941.679
so that never got published but in both

5939.76 --> 5944.159000000001
instances they they contacted me

5941.679 --> 5945.679
i get contacted by the by the press

5944.159 --> 5947.759999999999
quite frequently

5945.679 --> 5950.159
i just turn most of it down i'm just

5947.76 --> 5950.159000000001
gonna

5950.4 --> 5952.5599999999995
but

5963.76 --> 5968.8
you are the best sports person

5966.96 --> 5970.639
to like because whatever you would say

5968.8 --> 5972.56
they'd have a very hard time

5970.639 --> 5974.08
editing it in into something that you

5972.56 --> 5976.2390000000005
didn't say

5974.08 --> 5978.48
you know it's like it's still promotion

5976.239 --> 5980.48
all promotion is promotion

5978.48 --> 5982.239
i stopped here with your your channel

5980.48 --> 5984.638999999999
but i wouldn't be turning down the press

5982.239 --> 5988.08
i'd be saying come and talk to me

5984.639 --> 5991.36
poor publicity is good you say that but

5988.08 --> 5993.44
in every instance that i either was

5991.36 --> 5994.48
referred by another flat earther to

5993.44 --> 5997.199
press

5994.48 --> 5998.5599999999995
or they contacted me direct every time i

5997.199 --> 6000.96
turned it down

5998.56 --> 6002.719
a month later i saw the end result of

6000.96 --> 6005.44
the piece that they were planning

6002.719 --> 6007.119
and i i'm yet to be proven wrong about

6005.44 --> 6009.759999999999
what their intentions were

6007.119 --> 6010.799999999999
so i can smell a hit piece a mile away

6009.76 --> 6012.88
and every time i

6010.8 --> 6014.159000000001
sensed that it wouldn't go in my favor

6012.88 --> 6016.159000000001
i'm just like no

6014.159 --> 6018.159
i think you're gonna try and ridicule me

6016.159 --> 6020.638999999999
so i'm just i'm just not interested

6018.159 --> 6022.719
so i would often turn them down or you

6020.639 --> 6023.04
know the connection would be severed as

6022.719 --> 6024.96
in

6023.04 --> 6027.119
you drift apart the communication falls

6024.96 --> 6028.2390000000005
apart whatever but the point is that i'd

6027.119 --> 6031.599999999999
then later see

6028.239 --> 6034.0
somebody who i know being pummeled

6031.6 --> 6036.159000000001
by some newspaper and i'm like glad i

6034.0 --> 6038.159
turned that down

6036.159 --> 6039.679
pass that skill on to bob no dell nathan

6038.159 --> 6044.879999999999
will you

6039.679 --> 6047.92
dragon pass that skill is sniffing out

6044.88 --> 6048.56
[ __ ] like that to bob nodell ah don't

6047.92 --> 6050.159
give bob

6048.56 --> 6051.84
no doubt too hard a time i'm thanking

6050.159 --> 6052.719
him at the moment neil if it wasn't for

6051.84 --> 6055.84
bob no doubt

6052.719 --> 6058.4
right out of [ __ ] comes roses now the

6055.84 --> 6060.400000000001
rose in this scenario that involves bob

6058.4 --> 6062.0
is the fact that everyone is now acutely

6060.4 --> 6064.638999999999
aware of what the globe claim

6062.0 --> 6066.32
actually is now had it not been for

6064.639 --> 6069.04
netflix and bob

6066.32 --> 6070.639
would everybody be so acutely aware in

6069.04 --> 6072.239
this convoluted subject of what the

6070.639 --> 6074.639
globe claim actually is

6072.239 --> 6075.678999999999
15 degrees an hour drift as earth turns

6074.639 --> 6077.36
underneath

6075.679 --> 6078.96
i can say that that's actually quite a

6077.36 --> 6080.4
fairly lengthy and reasonably

6078.96 --> 6082.4800000000005
complicated statement

6080.4 --> 6084.5599999999995
15 degrees an hour drift as earth turns

6082.48 --> 6087.759999999999
underneath that's coriolis deflection

6084.56 --> 6089.52
i can say that and there's a good chance

6087.76 --> 6090.8
my audience knows what i'm talking about

6089.52 --> 6092.4800000000005
thanks to bob

6090.8 --> 6095.119000000001
so when i then say you and your

6092.48 --> 6098.239
reference frames are ruined

6095.119 --> 6100.08
that's very effective because they can't

6098.239 --> 6101.5199999999995
then say no it travel together and lose

6100.08 --> 6103.04
the audience in double speak because

6101.52 --> 6104.400000000001
we're talking about drift now

6103.04 --> 6106.08
we're all well aware that we're talking

6104.4 --> 6107.759999999999
about 15 degrees now drift

6106.08 --> 6109.679
because that's what they claim and bob's

6107.76 --> 6111.6
supposed to have proven it oh so he's

6109.679 --> 6113.52
supposed to have proven 15 degrees now

6111.6 --> 6116.320000000001
drifters earth turns underneath

6113.52 --> 6118.080000000001
it doesn't planes would drift away a

6116.32 --> 6120.08
thousand miles an hour on the equator

6118.08 --> 6122.239
helicopters and balloons and drones

6120.08 --> 6123.5199999999995
yeah we can focus on what they actually

6122.239 --> 6126.638999999999
claim now

6123.52 --> 6129.119000000001
thanks to dan and bob well that's

6126.639 --> 6129.84
unfortunate in the short term for bob

6129.119 --> 6132.08
nodell

6129.84 --> 6133.28
in the long term i could kiss the guy

6132.08 --> 6134.32
because what happens in this

6133.28 --> 6137.119
conversation

6134.32 --> 6139.04
they convolute it into two reference

6137.119 --> 6140.719
frames becoming one reference frames and

6139.04 --> 6141.36
justifying no drift like that's an

6140.719 --> 6142.96
argument

6141.36 --> 6144.5599999999995
for them when they're debunking their

6142.96 --> 6146.08
own claim well we've got to have it

6144.56 --> 6147.92
firmly established in the public's

6146.08 --> 6148.4
perception what the claim actually is

6147.92 --> 6150.56
first

6148.4 --> 6152.32
because if that's not firmly established

6150.56 --> 6153.1990000000005
15 degrees drift as earth turns

6152.32 --> 6154.799999999999
underneath

6153.199 --> 6156.239
you don't know what's supposed to be

6154.8 --> 6159.360000000001
being debunked

6156.239 --> 6162.159
now we do it's well established by

6159.36 --> 6163.28
everybody what we're debunking and what

6162.159 --> 6165.28
are we debunking

6163.28 --> 6166.639
15 degrees an hour drift as earth turns

6165.28 --> 6167.599999999999
underneath that's what's supposed to be

6166.639 --> 6171.28
proven

6167.6 --> 6173.119000000001
now we all know you can debunk it

6171.28 --> 6175.04
yeah in the long run it turned out to be

6173.119 --> 6176.239
good but for for two years hearing in

6175.04 --> 6178.48
boulder oh

6176.239 --> 6179.599999999999
a flat earth that proved that the earth

6178.48 --> 6182.32
moves

6179.6 --> 6183.84
oh that was annoying for a while well

6182.32 --> 6186.799999999999
turn it into roses neal

6183.84 --> 6187.52
not er not bob prove the earth was

6186.8 --> 6191.28
turning

6187.52 --> 6193.92
no say it like it needs to be said ah

6191.28 --> 6196.32
so bob proved earth turns underneath at

6193.92 --> 6198.96
15 degrees an hour

6196.32 --> 6200.0
so earth turns underneath drones at 15

6198.96 --> 6203.44
degrees an hour

6200.0 --> 6204.8
no it doesn't again establish what the

6203.44 --> 6207.199
argument actually is

6204.8 --> 6209.119000000001
use it to your advantage so earth turns

6207.199 --> 6211.678999999999
underneath at 15 degrees an hour then

6209.119 --> 6212.639
so things drift away drift apart at 15

6211.679 --> 6214.56
degrees an hour

6212.639 --> 6215.679
that would be drones drift away from me

6214.56 --> 6217.76
at a thousand miles an hour on the

6215.679 --> 6220.56
equator as i turn underneath them

6217.76 --> 6222.2390000000005
get the claim down so you can say no

6220.56 --> 6223.84
drones don't drift away from you a

6222.239 --> 6225.36
thousand miles an hour on the equator

6223.84 --> 6227.119000000001
helicopters can hover

6225.36 --> 6230.32
we're not seeing them deviate at 15

6227.119 --> 6232.08
degrees an hour that does not happen

6230.32 --> 6233.92
so we can debunk the actual claim they

6232.08 --> 6238.239
use to prove earth spins now

6233.92 --> 6240.8
so thanks bob yeah and thanks dan yeah

6238.239 --> 6242.4
you you have actually do you have any

6240.8 --> 6245.679
clue how much

6242.4 --> 6246.239
people have actually come to i can i say

6245.679 --> 6249.4400000000005
question

6246.239 --> 6251.28
because of that bob nodell 15

6249.44 --> 6253.839999999999
hour drift a lot of people weren't even

6251.28 --> 6255.679
aware of the flat earth

6253.84 --> 6257.6
conundrum no it wasn't even anybody's

6255.679 --> 6259.84
mind until they see it on netflix

6257.6 --> 6262.0
yeah i understand that was bad that was

6259.84 --> 6264.2390000000005
bad i don't i don't care that was bad

6262.0 --> 6265.76
no i've just told you why it's good now

6264.239 --> 6266.4
when anyone comes and watches my show

6265.76 --> 6268.56
and say

6266.4 --> 6270.879999999999
and they hear me say so earth's supposed

6268.56 --> 6273.280000000001
to turn underneath at 15 degrees an hour

6270.88 --> 6274.719
15 degrees an hour drift earth turning

6273.28 --> 6276.32
underneath

6274.719 --> 6279.28
when i say those things people know what

6276.32 --> 6279.28
i'm talking about now

6281.44 --> 6284.638999999999
yeah and all that they're just looking

6282.88 --> 6286.2390000000005
for what's going on in the head of all

6284.639 --> 6287.4400000000005
the people that we're thinking about for

6286.239 --> 6290.0
all these years

6287.44 --> 6291.919999999999
right because they proved that 15

6290.0 --> 6293.119
degrees an hour of the earth is spinning

6291.92 --> 6297.28
underneath

6293.119 --> 6299.759999999999
so doesn't that require reference frames

6297.28 --> 6301.04
yeah it does and you and your reference

6299.76 --> 6304.88
frames have been ruined

6301.04 --> 6307.679
cymandan 2020 no it's actually 2019

6304.88 --> 6307.679
that's a year old

6308.239 --> 6313.28
i just like giving bob a hard time

6309.84 --> 6313.28
because he's a gravity pusher

6313.36 --> 6317.839999999999
you make it sound like he's dealing

6314.96 --> 6317.84
crack

6318.4 --> 6325.119
well in essence it is it destroys life

6321.44 --> 6327.839999999999
no it just convolutes things

6325.119 --> 6328.719
that's all there's plenty of people out

6327.84 --> 6331.4400000000005
there

6328.719 --> 6331.92
pushing ideas that we do not push right

6331.44 --> 6333.36
and

6331.92 --> 6335.1990000000005
we're bob to be here he'd get the same

6333.36 --> 6337.92
treatment oh we got yesterday

6335.199 --> 6339.04
and he knows that so it's not like we

6337.92 --> 6340.8
are ever going to change our positions

6339.04 --> 6342.48
based on what individuals on their own

6340.8 --> 6344.2390000000005
channels decide to push

6342.48 --> 6345.919999999999
we could spend all day going through no

6344.239 --> 6347.44
you're just going to talk in circles

6345.92 --> 6349.6
forever and never do

6347.44 --> 6351.04
anything that's what you're going to do

6349.6 --> 6353.6
okay so thank you

6351.04 --> 6354.32
not very entertaining after what are you

6353.6 --> 6358.08
doing

6354.32 --> 6359.119
this guy wants to saw derth play a

6358.08 --> 6361.44
little experiment

6359.119 --> 6362.96
in his kitchen with a flashlight and a

6361.44 --> 6364.799999999999
piece of cardboard

6362.96 --> 6366.8
but i guess that was too expensive for

6364.8 --> 6368.639
you nathan you need all your pounds

6366.8 --> 6370.639
over there on the jolly roll why have

6368.639 --> 6373.04
you descended into that humming me

6370.639 --> 6373.04
and just

6381.28 --> 6386.0
like you you would be slapped and on the

6383.119 --> 6388.96
ground crying if you stopped

6386.0 --> 6390.719
this guy literally wants to hurt me he's

6388.96 --> 6392.639
so offended by me destroying his

6390.719 --> 6393.44
fundamentalist religious zealot belief

6392.639 --> 6395.119
in a globe

6393.44 --> 6396.799999999999
that he now wants to hurt me and see me

6395.119 --> 6399.28
with no money what a shock

6396.8 --> 6401.360000000001
yeah like thunderfoot how dare this guy

6399.28 --> 6401.92
have patreons how dare this guy earn a

6401.36 --> 6404.159
living

6401.92 --> 6405.1990000000005
you want to see me in pain don't you no

6404.159 --> 6406.879999999999
i'm

6405.199 --> 6408.4
no i'm on the fence just asking a

6406.88 --> 6408.96
question you can suck my balls on the

6408.4 --> 6410.4
fence

6408.96 --> 6412.4800000000005
you hate the fact that i've destroyed

6410.4 --> 6414.0
your globe belief on the fence my ass

6412.48 --> 6415.5199999999995
you want to see me in pain you've just

6414.0 --> 6417.679
made that explicitly clear

6415.52 --> 6419.76
and i'm delighted because it's your

6417.679 --> 6422.159
projection of your pain

6419.76 --> 6423.52
share it with us give me a break dude

6422.159 --> 6425.28
yeah we'll give you a break earth's not

6423.52 --> 6427.119000000001
a sphere the sky's not a vacuum

6425.28 --> 6428.5599999999995
you've been lied to on a massive scale

6427.119 --> 6430.48
and you want to blame me

6428.56 --> 6432.400000000001
you want to see me in pain for that now

6430.48 --> 6434.0
this is your own pain material

6432.4 --> 6435.5199999999995
question and you start yelling and

6434.0 --> 6437.44
calling me names and then i'm telling

6435.52 --> 6438.88
you to show your pain and eat your mic

6437.44 --> 6441.919999999999
while you tell me how i would get

6438.88 --> 6443.6
slapped yeah well i'd be in pain no this

6441.92 --> 6445.36
is your cognitive pain not me

6443.6 --> 6446.8
i don't deserve to be beaten up because

6445.36 --> 6449.5199999999995
you don't like the fact your religious

6446.8 --> 6449.52
beliefs dying

6449.6 --> 6454.08
i don't have a religious belief about

6452.32 --> 6457.119
you though

6454.08 --> 6457.119
you've got a fundy belief

6458.08 --> 6462.5599999999995
hello got funny belief in a sky vacuum

6461.119 --> 6464.5599999999995
that you think i should be out there

6462.56 --> 6466.0
debunking when i've already debunked it

6464.56 --> 6470.639
but that's not good enough i should be

6466.0 --> 6472.239
out with bits of string all i'm saying

6470.639 --> 6472.96
is that you got you could talk and

6472.239 --> 6474.638999999999
that's talk

6472.96 --> 6476.4800000000005
but then you know just like you say with

6474.639 --> 6477.36
the scientific method at the end you do

6476.48 --> 6479.199
an experiment

6477.36 --> 6480.96
you know right at the end of the

6479.199 --> 6483.759999999999
scientific experiment to see

6480.96 --> 6486.32
which way it is yes or no you don't know

6483.76 --> 6488.2390000000005
what science is

6486.32 --> 6490.239
it is this you do the shape of the earth

6488.239 --> 6492.5599999999995
the scientific question

6490.239 --> 6493.599999999999
sizing me on my use of science so fine

6492.56 --> 6496.080000000001
i'll take you down

6493.6 --> 6499.04
if you want to be humiliated about that

6496.08 --> 6499.04
you're just you just

6502.88 --> 6506.159000000001
hello you've just criticized me for my

6504.96 --> 6507.84
lack of science

6506.159 --> 6509.599999999999
now we're going to discover what you're

6507.84 --> 6511.04
scientifically because how are you going

6509.6 --> 6512.639
to talk

6511.04 --> 6514.88
hello can we to a two-way conversation

6512.639 --> 6517.4400000000005
without you talking to me please

6514.88 --> 6519.92
so all right sorry thank you so you've

6517.44 --> 6521.678999999999
criticized my scientific acumen

6519.92 --> 6526.32
what are the three constituent parts of

6521.679 --> 6528.88
a scientific experiment

6526.32 --> 6530.08
and then you make a claim and then wrong

6528.88 --> 6533.36
you go out

6530.08 --> 6534.96
[ __ ] [ __ ] you stupid [ __ ] wit dick

6533.36 --> 6537.44
now you're gonna get berated by a flat

6539.52 --> 6543.040000000001
right you

6540.48 --> 6545.119
you person you stuttering [ __ ] that

6543.04 --> 6546.32
is not one of the constituent parts of a

6545.119 --> 6548.32
scientific experiment

6546.32 --> 6550.639
how dare you criticize my scientific

6548.32 --> 6553.599
acumen when you are a [ __ ]

6550.639 --> 6554.159000000001
i do not know what science is how dare

6553.599 --> 6556.56
you

6554.159 --> 6558.5599999999995
you stupid [ __ ] speaking to me like

6556.56 --> 6559.76
this you are a [ __ ]

6558.56 --> 6561.360000000001
you don't even know what the three

6559.76 --> 6562.320000000001
constituent parts of a scientific

6561.36 --> 6564.0
experiment are

6562.32 --> 6565.36
i asked you and you don't know you were

6564.0 --> 6567.92
wrong a [ __ ]

6565.36 --> 6570.32
an idiot who is being berated by a flat

6567.92 --> 6570.96
earther for the second time on the same

6570.32 --> 6573.44
show

6570.96 --> 6575.199
now sit down don't tell me about how

6573.44 --> 6577.5199999999995
good my scientific acumen is

6575.199 --> 6582.159
you haven't got one so decide to

6577.52 --> 6584.56
criticize what i have and you do not

6582.159 --> 6585.5199999999995
why i'm asking shut up you stupid

6584.56 --> 6587.679
ignorant dick

6585.52 --> 6589.1990000000005
you have no clue what science is and for

6587.679 --> 6589.76
that you're being told off by a flat

6589.199 --> 6592.0
earther

6589.76 --> 6594.08
for the second time on the same show

6592.0 --> 6595.28
don't criticize my scientific acumen you

6594.08 --> 6597.679
don't have one

6595.28 --> 6599.599
you haven't even got the vagus clue what

6597.679 --> 6601.4400000000005
a scientific experiment is

6599.599 --> 6603.360000000001
i asked you and you gave me an incorrect

6601.44 --> 6606.48
declaration you stupid

6603.36 --> 6608.32
idiot that's why you're getting berated

6606.48 --> 6610.08
for your stupidity on the second

6608.32 --> 6611.759999999999
consecutive attempt

6610.08 --> 6613.679
to join in a conversation between

6611.76 --> 6614.4800000000005
intelligent people who do know what

6613.679 --> 6617.599
science is

6614.48 --> 6618.48
and that is not you all right you'll be

6617.599 --> 6621.1990000000005
on the ground

6618.48 --> 6623.44
slap dead crying yeah yeah tell me how

much you want to see me in pain

6623.44 --> 6626.879999999999
well i humiliate your dumb ass for not

6625.599 --> 6628.639
knowing what science is

6626.88 --> 6630.400000000001
you tell my audience how you'd like to

6628.639 --> 6631.92
see me be hurt for this

6630.4 --> 6634.239
yeah it's called projection like a real

6631.92 --> 6635.599
tough guy yeah yeah yeah tough guy

yeah you're a [ __ ] it doesn't know

6635.599 --> 6638.2390000000005
what science is and you're getting told

6636.96 --> 6640.08
that by a flat earther

6638.239 --> 6642.159
you don't have to like it but it is

6640.08 --> 6644.719
what's happening you [ __ ] clown

6642.159 --> 6646.4
with zero scientific acumen you're being

6644.719 --> 6649.44
disciplined by me

6646.4 --> 6652.799999999999
told what's what by a flat earther

6649.44 --> 6655.199
i love it yeah you could talk

6652.8 --> 6657.04
but in reality if you're a [ __ ] in

6655.199 --> 6657.5199999999995
reality who's getting told what science

6657.04 --> 6658.719
isn't

6657.52 --> 6660.88
when you give me an incorrect

6658.719 --> 6662.639
declaration about what a constituent

6660.88 --> 6664.8
part of a scientific experiment is

6662.639 --> 6666.88
which you don't know because you are

6664.8 --> 6668.2390000000005
thick now maybe if you eventually sit

6666.88 --> 6670.08
down and shut the [ __ ] up

6668.239 --> 6671.598999999999
i'll educate you on the three

6670.08 --> 6672.32
constituent parts of a scientific

6671.599 --> 6674.4800000000005
experiment

6672.32 --> 6675.599
which you do not know because you the

6674.48 --> 6679.839999999999
globe believer are

6675.599 --> 6681.599
ignorant well if some guy came up to me

6679.84 --> 6682.08
talking like this to myself yeah you get

6681.599 --> 6685.04
really

6682.08 --> 6686.8
told you're a stupid idiot when you make

6685.04 --> 6689.119
declarations about science

6686.8 --> 6690.639
you question my scientific acumen should

6689.119 --> 6692.0
i punch you in the nose

6690.639 --> 6694.0
because you haven't got a [ __ ] clue

6692.0 --> 6696.0
what science is does that mean i should

6694.0 --> 6697.28
beat you on the floor beat the living

6696.0 --> 6698.48
[ __ ] out of you because you told me i

6697.28 --> 6700.719
don't know what science is

6698.48 --> 6702.08
when you haven't got the vegas clue is

6700.719 --> 6703.679
that what happens to people who come and

6702.08 --> 6704.639
make declarations about what people

6703.679 --> 6706.96
don't know

6704.639 --> 6708.4800000000005
you should be beating up right should

6706.96 --> 6709.679
you be beating up for telling me i don't

6708.48 --> 6711.04
know what science is when you haven't

6709.679 --> 6712.639
got the first clue

6711.04 --> 6714.32
that's what you're saying it's

6712.639 --> 6715.84
reasonable that if someone comes and

6714.32 --> 6716.639
makes an assertion that's totally

6715.84 --> 6718.4800000000005
unreasonable

6716.639 --> 6719.679
like you've done you don't know what

6718.48 --> 6721.36
science is nathan

6719.679 --> 6724.2390000000005
so that means you should get beaten up

6721.36 --> 6727.199
does it you stupid dick

6724.239 --> 6728.718999999999
no when you would say no so how dare you

6727.199 --> 6729.839999999999
assert that because i've pummeled your

6728.719 --> 6731.119
absolute nonsense

6729.84 --> 6733.360000000001
that somehow that means that i'd get

6731.119 --> 6735.759999999999
beaten up at the end yeah a pathetic

6733.36 --> 6737.679
loser who loses an argument would turn

6735.76 --> 6740.400000000001
it into a physical altercation

6737.679 --> 6742.639
that's what you would do my friend you'd

6740.4 --> 6743.839999999999
beat me up for losing your argument

6742.639 --> 6746.96
and getting told that you don't know

6743.84 --> 6748.56
what science is you'd hate being told

6746.96 --> 6750.4800000000005
you'd see the disdain on my face and

6748.56 --> 6751.92
you'd want to wipe it off with a fist

6750.48 --> 6754.799999999999
because you don't got a [ __ ] argument

6751.92 --> 6756.719
to do it without you dick brain

6754.8 --> 6758.320000000001
i want to insult the person i'm talking

6756.719 --> 6761.36
or insulting you

6758.32 --> 6763.92
for your stupidity because you

6761.36 --> 6766.719
are stupid when asked what science is

6763.92 --> 6769.1990000000005
you didn't [ __ ] know

6766.719 --> 6770.159
and you know earlier so you were

6769.199 --> 6772.0
insulting

6770.159 --> 6773.44
yeah you decided to question my

6772.0 --> 6775.92
scientific acumen

6773.44 --> 6778.0
i asked about yours and then you started

6775.92 --> 6780.88
funding muting me like you're doing now

6778.0 --> 6782.0
what i would do is punch you that's what

6780.88 --> 6784.56
you told us

6782.0 --> 6786.56
you're a violent scumbag the people who

6784.56 --> 6787.52
come into my comments and tell me i'm a

6786.56 --> 6789.76
psychopath

6787.52 --> 6791.119000000001
because i pummel their arguments are

6789.76 --> 6794.2390000000005
merely projecting

6791.119 --> 6796.159
their own psychotic nature onto me you

6794.239 --> 6796.799999999999
would physically have an altercation

6796.159 --> 6799.199
with me

6796.8 --> 6800.719
because you've lost your argument after

6799.199 --> 6801.28
telling me i don't know what i'm talking

6800.719 --> 6803.04
about

6801.28 --> 6804.639
something about your own standards i

6803.04 --> 6806.239
should punch you in the face for

6804.639 --> 6807.679
yeah you come up to me and tell me i

6806.239 --> 6809.04
don't know what science is when you

6807.679 --> 6810.639
haven't got a vegas clue

6809.04 --> 6812.88
yeah by your standards i should just

6810.639 --> 6813.92
punch you how dare you tell me i don't

6812.88 --> 6815.52
know what i'm talking about when you

6813.92 --> 6816.0
haven't got the vagus clue what science

6815.52 --> 6818.320000000001
is

6816.0 --> 6819.76
you've got no right i on the other hand

6818.32 --> 6821.679
don't see it as reasonable

6819.76 --> 6823.599
when someone comes up and challenges me

6821.679 --> 6825.52
based on my understanding of science

6823.599 --> 6827.360000000001
even if they're a clueless [ __ ] like

6825.52 --> 6828.719
you that it would be reasonable to punch

6827.36 --> 6831.759999999999
you in the face for that

6828.719 --> 6833.679
what i will do is tell you with all the

6831.76 --> 6837.04
disdain i can muster

6833.679 --> 6839.679
to humiliate you by way of your own

6837.04 --> 6840.32
stupid declarations i'll point them out

6839.679 --> 6842.719
to you

6840.32 --> 6844.32
and then i'll humiliate you for them

6842.719 --> 6845.199
because i can't reach through this mic

6844.32 --> 6848.88
and punch you

6845.199 --> 6852.0
but i can degrade you i can

6848.88 --> 6854.400000000001
humiliate you i can tell you

6852.0 --> 6856.08
with absolute authority that you're a

6854.4 --> 6857.92
complete [ __ ]

6856.08 --> 6859.679
and i can justify it with your own

6857.92 --> 6861.4400000000005
[ __ ] words [ __ ]

6859.679 --> 6863.04
now you don't have to like it and you

6861.44 --> 6864.159
can tell my audience how you'd want to

6863.04 --> 6865.84
hurt me for it

6864.159 --> 6868.32
but it won't change how [ __ ] wrong

6865.84 --> 6869.76
you are and how little you stupid clowns

6868.32 --> 6871.44
know about science

6869.76 --> 6873.119000000001
you haven't got the first clue what

6871.44 --> 6875.199
science even is

6873.119 --> 6876.639
by talking through me this whole time

6875.199 --> 6878.48
just means you haven't listened

6876.639 --> 6880.400000000001
but my audience will hear me berating

6878.48 --> 6883.28
you while you fundy mute me you stupid

6880.4 --> 6883.28
scumbag troll

6883.52 --> 6886.320000000001
all right you're a [ __ ] that's

6884.88 --> 6887.679
basically all yeah that's what he's got

6886.32 --> 6889.119
an ad hom

6887.679 --> 6890.32
talk through every [ __ ] word of me

6889.119 --> 6892.08
berating him so he doesn't have to

6890.32 --> 6893.84
listen to it and then tell me i'm a

6892.08 --> 6895.36
[ __ ]

6893.84 --> 6897.360000000001
you're a [ __ ] because yeah yeah yeah i

6895.36 --> 6898.88
heard your ad hom the first time

6897.36 --> 6901.119
you're a [ __ ] and doesn't understand

6898.88 --> 6902.8
what science is i've declared it because

6901.119 --> 6903.5199999999995
it's true i've given an example because

6902.8 --> 6905.1990000000005
it's true

6903.52 --> 6907.280000000001
you've made a declaration incorrectly

6905.199 --> 6909.919999999999
about what a scientific experiment is

6907.28 --> 6912.5599999999995
demonstrating your stupidity calling me

6909.92 --> 6917.599
a [ __ ] isn't a [ __ ] work

6912.56 --> 6917.599
it takes a dick to know a [ __ ] yes no

6921.599 --> 6926.88
i don't understand i don't understand

6924.56 --> 6933.84
what your tactic is here guy

6926.88 --> 6933.84
what's he talking about he's garnered

6941.199 --> 6947.839999999999
go somewhere go to watch some movies

6946.159 --> 6949.44
if he had humility he won't be coming in

6947.84 --> 6952.4800000000005
here doing this nonsense

6949.44 --> 6955.36
throwing his weight around

6952.48 --> 6960.32
yeah he's just starting his maturity he

6955.36 --> 6962.0
has none

6960.32 --> 6964.32
he's being really honest he's expressing

6962.0 --> 6966.8
how they all feel i love it

6964.32 --> 6969.28
they all want me to be in pain they all

6966.8 --> 6971.04
want me to be penniless and in pain

6969.28 --> 6973.599
why because they can't defeat my

6971.04 --> 6975.119
argument and that's what's just happened

6973.599 --> 6976.32
he couldn't defeat my argument he

6975.119 --> 6977.598999999999
doesn't know what science is his

6976.32 --> 6979.36
argument is you don't know what science

6977.599 --> 6981.360000000001
is and i've proved how stupid he is

6979.36 --> 6983.28
what's the result he wants to hurt me

6981.36 --> 6986.5599999999995
and have me earn no money

6983.28 --> 6988.719
yeah it's pathetic and telling

6986.56 --> 6991.04
that's how these people are they're just

6988.719 --> 6992.639
scum

6991.04 --> 6994.32
well he says he was on the fence he's a

6992.639 --> 6996.4800000000005
lie he's disingenuous

6994.32 --> 6998.239
he comes on if he if he was on the fence

6996.48 --> 6999.759999999999
he'd ask serious questions

6998.239 --> 7001.759999999999
and we would know the difference but we

6999.76 --> 7002.88
sniff right through it and when push

7001.76 --> 7005.76
came to shove

7002.88 --> 7007.28
he starts ad harming you and starts

7005.76 --> 7009.119000000001
berating you because

7007.28 --> 7010.88
you do a show when you earn a living

7009.119 --> 7012.88
doing this and you're not sending up a

7010.88 --> 7015.36
balloon nathan

7012.88 --> 7016.0
it's pathetic but ultimately it's so

7015.36 --> 7020.159

7066.8 --> 7069.84
i've humiliated your lack of

7068.239 --> 7071.678999999999
understanding when it comes to science

7069.84 --> 7073.679
when that was your attack on me

7071.679 --> 7074.88
yeah i'd be pissed off too it's

7073.679 --> 7077.04

7081.76 --> 7086.08
scum

7082.4 --> 7086.5599999999995
they are what's the first thing he said

7086.08 --> 7088.48
for the

7086.56 --> 7090.56
the science what's the first constituent

7088.48 --> 7092.879999999999
what did he say

7090.56 --> 7094.320000000001
ask a question did i hear that right i

7092.88 --> 7097.119
think he was trying to describe the

7094.32 --> 7101.28
scientific method

7097.119 --> 7102.96
that's not quite okay it's just wrong

7101.28 --> 7105.84
wrong or incapable of listening either

7102.96 --> 7105.84
way ignorant

7106.639 --> 7110.159000000001
wants to come and attack me on that

7107.92 --> 7113.679
score for example

7110.159 --> 7113.679
if you say that we have two horizons

7120.08 --> 7123.76
if you say that we have two horizons for

7122.4 --> 7126.32
example what they said

7123.76 --> 7127.04
many times even three horizons is that

7126.32 --> 7130.96
not

7127.04 --> 7132.719
insulting yeah to us that's insulting

7130.96 --> 7134.159
yeah that's insulting that you're

7132.719 --> 7137.44
[ __ ] saying some

7134.159 --> 7138.32
[ __ ] lie you know and that is not

7137.44 --> 7140.48
insulting

7138.32 --> 7142.0
that is like a beautiful way to speak we

7140.48 --> 7144.32
have two horizons

7142.0 --> 7145.29
[ __ ] you we don't have two horizons we

7144.32 --> 7147.44
have one

7145.29 --> 7149.679
