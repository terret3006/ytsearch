hello all right so

180.4 --> 187.519

185.44 --> 188.64
jam-packed with all kinds of streams and

187.519 --> 191.28
all that

188.64 --> 193.51899999999998
and i caught this this time yeah the

191.28 --> 196.48
flat earth debates was pretty good

193.519 --> 199.59900000000002
although it wasn't there for a big part

196.48 --> 201.67999999999998
or rather in the background i don't know

199.599 --> 202.72
but yeah it was still good to listen and

201.68 --> 204.15900000000002
i did jump in

202.72 --> 207.68
every now and then with an with an

204.159 --> 207.67999999999998
argument uh

207.92 --> 214.07999999999998
but we'll hear that friday

212.08 --> 216.08
uh yeah it was pretty lame a long after

214.08 --> 219.59900000000002
show uh

216.08 --> 224.48000000000002
also somewhere in the afternoon was i

219.599 --> 226.23899999999998
caught a really woke show from roxanne

224.48 --> 229.2
who had a they had a well it was a

226.239 --> 231.20000000000002
pre-recording but they had a guest on

229.2 --> 233.11999999999998
that they interviewed was really into

231.2 --> 236.72
music and

233.12 --> 238.159
very interesting persons very creative

236.72 --> 241.599
very

238.159 --> 243.599
smart like i could feel it off him

241.599 --> 246.07999999999998
that's an interesting individual it was

243.599 --> 248.23899999999998
really too bad that i couldn't

246.08 --> 250.48000000000002
that we couldn't in the chat just and

248.239 --> 253.84
ask questions directly

250.48 --> 254.959
but yeah maybe next time they will come

253.84 --> 257.76
live

254.959 --> 257.76
that was pretty good

259.519 --> 266.639
it's definitely worth sitting through

263.28 --> 268.15999999999997
uh yeah other than that i run real media

266.639 --> 272.08
a late

268.16 --> 275.44
evening and just a lot of letters debate

272.08 --> 278.96
three streams premieres from

275.44 --> 279.52
back and they were good so it's funny

278.96 --> 282.63899999999995
like

279.52 --> 285.52
often nathan just restreams

282.639 --> 286.96000000000004
like a stream maybe the last week or

285.52 --> 288.79999999999995
even the week before

286.96 --> 291.28
that he picks that he thinks is very

288.8 --> 295.04
good overall

291.28 --> 296.71999999999997
and yeah i like his picks it just so

295.04 --> 298.47900000000004
happened to be the

296.72 --> 300.32000000000005
some of the flat earth debates where i

298.479 --> 304.0
myself also am like

300.32 --> 307.36
in like in in prime

304.0 --> 311.36
condition to do things so

307.36 --> 313.759
yeah i like that

311.36 --> 314.40000000000003
computer just froze so i don't know what

313.759 --> 317.28000000000003
happens

314.4 --> 319.59999999999997
what you've been saying okay roxanna's

317.28 --> 319.59999999999997
ace

319.919 --> 323.12
sheffield in the process few weeks ago

321.919 --> 326.56
all right cool

323.12 --> 327.759
i met her at the amsterdam flat earth

326.56 --> 331.28000000000003
convention

327.759 --> 335.759
in december 1990 that's 1920

331.28 --> 339.84
2019. what the [ __ ]

335.759 --> 339.84000000000003
a hundred years ago now

341.36 --> 344.88
yeah she's really cool and she's like

344.4 --> 348.63899999999995
very

344.88 --> 348.639
she's such a driven person

349.199 --> 353.199
she has she just has this restless drive

352.24 --> 356.8
insider that's

353.199 --> 360.0
always thinking about

356.8 --> 362.24
and i think probably planning about just

360.0 --> 363.039
doing that thing doing her thing and the

362.24 --> 365.039
community

363.039 --> 367.199
always can you could just see it in her

365.039 --> 368.96
mind i can see it in my maybe it's

367.199 --> 371.91900000000004
projection i don't know

368.96 --> 373.84
she just seems very energetic and

371.919 --> 376.56
enthusiastic

373.84 --> 378.84
and focused at the same time that's it

376.56 --> 381.84
and that's a very interesting

378.84 --> 384.08
combination

381.84 --> 384.08
right

388.0 --> 397.6
where is everyone

394.639 --> 397.6
what's going on

401.68 --> 409.84000000000003
this is quite unusual

412.56 --> 414.88
hmm

415.599 --> 418.71999999999997
all right i guess it's just you and me

417.599 --> 423.199
then although nine

418.72 --> 425.68
people are watching according to

423.199 --> 425.68
youtube

427.199 --> 434.639
uh it's a spiritual fight for yeah yeah

432.319 --> 437.84000000000003
well she's definitely got that invested

434.639 --> 437.84000000000003
into it as well

443.039 --> 451.84
ah here we go hello granddam

446.16 --> 451.84000000000003
good to see you

457.199 --> 460.56
atheist dominion what's the topic for

460.08 --> 462.8
today

460.56 --> 464.56
well it can be pretty much anything it's

462.8 --> 467.28000000000003
a saturday show so it's going to be one

464.56 --> 470.8
and a half hours at least

467.28 --> 474.31899999999996
and yeah i'm up for pretty much

470.8 --> 476.479
anything although

474.319 --> 478.24
yeah i'm not just like the end of

476.479 --> 480.56
yesterday's show i'm not gonna tolerate

478.24 --> 481.68
people calling the bible a fairy tale

480.56 --> 485.039
book

481.68 --> 486.0
that's just unacceptable other than that

485.039 --> 489.44
i'm pretty much

486.0 --> 489.44
open for any discussion

490.319 --> 495.599
just got the notification

493.36 --> 495.599
okay

497.039 --> 501.84
uh brandon i usually don't even trust

499.199 --> 503.36
the youtube notifications anymore

501.84 --> 505.84
neither with nathan occly's channel

503.36 --> 508.0
although they do sometimes just work you

505.84 --> 508.96
know if i expect the show is coming then

508.0 --> 512.0
i am going to

508.96 --> 512.7189999999999
their channel and look in their video

512.0 --> 515.279
list

512.719 --> 517.44
because usually even if the the pop-up

515.279 --> 519.36
doesn't come

517.44 --> 520.719
you will still see that it's live over

519.36 --> 523.76
there

520.719 --> 525.519
so i'm used to notifications not working

523.76 --> 527.92
for like a year now

525.519 --> 534.08
not properly it's just sporadic it's

527.92 --> 538.959
completely unreliable

534.08 --> 538.9590000000001
hey flat soy good to see you

542.64 --> 549.8389999999999
and george sanford

551.839 --> 555.7600000000001
writing and translated by man truth

554.8 --> 558.0
among lies

555.76 --> 558.0
that

560.839 --> 566.0
nah i don't know

563.68 --> 567.12
it's just misconceptions it's just

566.0 --> 569.6
changing the words

567.12 --> 571.04
and the problem is a lot of it is really

569.6 --> 573.2
based on the mindset

571.04 --> 574.48
also of the language itself and the time

573.2 --> 576.24
period

574.48 --> 578.16
and that's really how the mistakes slip

576.24 --> 580.16
in so what at first seems like a

578.16 --> 581.68
yeah you have to make a choice you have

580.16 --> 583.279
to use a word

581.68 --> 584.7199999999999
and then at the time they might not

583.279 --> 587.36
really realize the long-term

584.72 --> 589.279
consequences of how the mindsets

587.36 --> 591.6
would change and what would truly be

589.279 --> 593.8389999999999
lost in that information

591.6 --> 593.839
so

595.68 --> 602.8389999999999
whether it is completely on purpose

599.2 --> 606.0790000000001
i'm not sure about that i think that

602.839 --> 608.1600000000001
specific misinformation placements

606.079 --> 609.279
in general not saying that that is in

608.16 --> 611.6
the bible

609.279 --> 613.04
or maybe i don't know conceptions like

611.6 --> 617.36
trinity

613.04 --> 620.079
afterward i don't know but in general

617.36 --> 621.36
added information that's not critical to

620.079 --> 623.68
the

621.36 --> 624.64
to the overall structure is usually a

623.68 --> 632.2399999999999
sign that it's

624.64 --> 634.56
information placement

632.24 --> 635.279
bible do you prefer to use i don't

634.56 --> 638.959
really

635.279 --> 640.56
use bibles in general i'm an as a

638.959 --> 643.76
terrorist

640.56 --> 646.56
but i got one bible recommended to me

643.76 --> 648.64
for yeah for a bible reading beginner as

646.56 --> 650.7199999999999
it were

648.64 --> 651.76
by bible literalist and she recommended

650.72 --> 655.0400000000001
me the nlt

651.76 --> 657.04
bible so i i got that one mektun

655.04 --> 660.64
actually sent a copy to me

657.04 --> 662.7199999999999
over the mail just like that

660.64 --> 664.16
that was really nice of him despite him

662.72 --> 667.76
being a yeah

664.16 --> 675.8389999999999
pretty fanatic baller yeah even fanatic

667.76 --> 675.8389999999999
ballers can be nice people sometimes

677.2 --> 679.44
what

681.04 --> 689.8389999999999
the quran what

695.36 --> 699.92
well everything i explained it was very

698.48 --> 701.9200000000001
short

699.92 --> 703.5999999999999
but that really does apply to the whole

701.92 --> 706.399
works because every book

703.6 --> 708.9590000000001
that is that arrives is based on the

706.399 --> 712.88
experience and cultural

708.959 --> 716.3199999999999
uh temporalness of the situation

712.88 --> 719.68
and the location and this is just the

716.32 --> 723.7600000000001
natural consequences of being humans

719.68 --> 727.92
really in my opinion but then because

723.76 --> 731.36
the feel of it some principles are just

727.92 --> 733.279
completely contradicting with another

731.36 --> 734.8000000000001
moment of revelation in another time

733.279 --> 737.12
period

734.8 --> 739.12
that doesn't mean that it per definition

737.12 --> 742.399
should be thrown out entirely

739.12 --> 744.0
just means it's just other situations at

742.399 --> 746.8
play as well and

744.0 --> 749.2
mistakes i really see it as such

746.8 --> 752.24
mistakes

749.2 --> 757.6
mistakes slip in because it's people

752.24 --> 760.16
trying to define the divine

757.6 --> 763.76
yeah mistakes are going to slip in

760.16 --> 763.76
because it's human beings doing that

764.16 --> 767.8389999999999
mistaken interpretations that appeal a

766.32 --> 770.24
lot like aberrations

767.839 --> 772.0
like that appeal a lot and then people

770.24 --> 772.88
latch on to that and then that becomes

772.0 --> 776.0
the standard

772.88 --> 778.88
well that was only a mistake

776.0 --> 781.44
but yeah people can't really recognize

778.88 --> 781.4399999999999
it anymore

781.76 --> 785.12
unless they really really study the

784.48 --> 787.44
deeper

785.12 --> 789.36
esoteric meanings and then they figure

787.44 --> 791.2
out a way

789.36 --> 792.88
we've been thinking it was this but it

791.2 --> 794.88
actually when you look at the

792.88 --> 796.56
language route originally it actually

794.88 --> 798.8389999999999
turned out to be something else yeah

796.56 --> 801.1199999999999
yeah that's that's precisely what i'm

798.839 --> 803.12
saying

801.12 --> 805.279
that doesn't mean that it's all just

803.12 --> 815.839
made up

805.279 --> 815.8389999999999
see that's where it goes a step too far

826.24 --> 833.839
flat sword well that's only

830.0 --> 836.56
one type of bible now isn't it

833.839 --> 843.839
francis bacon did not have his hands on

836.56 --> 843.8389999999999
every single bible version ever

848.8 --> 855.279
like there are really

851.92 --> 858.88
really old greek

855.279 --> 859.199
bibles nobody did anything with that

858.88 --> 863.6
they

859.199 --> 866.079
are old and original nobody edited that

863.6 --> 867.519
people interpreted it their own way and

866.079 --> 869.68
then other people went with that

867.519 --> 871.76
interpretation but that bible that old

869.68 --> 874.88
version is still there

871.76 --> 878.399
as is as was so

874.88 --> 881.199
to say that all the masons are jesuit

878.399 --> 881.199
all of them that they

881.68 --> 885.04
yeah you know the worst they could have

884.72 --> 888.24
done

885.04 --> 888.959
is removed certain even more perfected

888.24 --> 892.0790000000001
versions

888.959 --> 894.0
from the consciousness erased it so that

892.079 --> 895.92
only the dwelling verses would

894.0 --> 897.519
sustain themselves would yeah would

895.92 --> 900.24
continue on i don't know that's

897.519 --> 902.72
the worst i can imagine but yeah there

900.24 --> 906.48
is the greek bible version it's old

902.72 --> 906.48
so if it's there

906.56 --> 913.8389999999999
yeah how is that going to be edited

909.6 --> 913.839
it's not

920.24 --> 929.36
that's ridiculous flashlight

926.32 --> 933.6
i i don't i don't understand why you see

929.36 --> 933.6
why you think that i don't understand at

938.839 --> 941.839
all

945.47 --> 948.58
[Music]

950.48 --> 955.839
a more colored

968.56 --> 974.6389999999999
here we go again how can you even say

972.0 --> 974.639
such a thing

979.6 --> 984.399
people that say that they don't even

981.839 --> 987.0400000000001
understand what it's supposed to be

984.399 --> 988.399
atheist dominion every time somebody

987.04 --> 991.5999999999999
says that every time they say

988.399 --> 993.6
god there's no this doesn't exist

991.6 --> 995.6
do you simply don't know what the [ __ ]

993.6 --> 998.399
you read buddy

995.6 --> 999.839
you don't know what that means you're

998.399 --> 1001.36
using a word

999.839 --> 1004.399
and you probably have a visualized

1001.36 --> 1008.16
association with that word

1004.399 --> 1010.72
you're probably wrong because otherwise

1008.16 --> 1011.68
you would explain exactly what you

1010.72 --> 1015.44
thought it was

1011.68 --> 1018.079
and then perhaps say well

1015.44 --> 1019.6800000000001
i disagree with it because of empirical

1018.079 --> 1021.199
reasons

1019.68 --> 1023.279
that's not what you're doing that's

1021.199 --> 1026.72
never what

1023.279 --> 1039.839
bible skeptics that be really nice here

1026.72 --> 1039.839
that's what they always say

1078.84 --> 1083.36
uh

1081.2 --> 1085.6000000000001
well mark collard it's not it's not even

1083.36 --> 1087.28
so much i totally agree it's a very wise

1085.6 --> 1090.24
thing to say that

1087.28 --> 1092.3999999999999
but i would reformulate it because it's

1090.24 --> 1095.1200000000001
not as much as about what you know

1092.4 --> 1096.88
it's about how well do you understand

1095.12 --> 1100.08
what you know

1096.88 --> 1100.0800000000002
that's the real issue

1100.32 --> 1104.8799999999999
that's the real difficult part of it all

1103.2 --> 1109.8400000000001
because there's plenty of information

1104.88 --> 1109.8400000000001
it's just that

1110.08 --> 1113.28
do you understand what you just read or

1112.32 --> 1116.72
saw

1113.28 --> 1118.559
or heard see how well do you see the

1116.72 --> 1121.6000000000001
structure of it all

1118.559 --> 1122.8799999999999
and how do how well do you see where it

1121.6 --> 1125.039
should be going

1122.88 --> 1126.64
into structures you cannot yet see

1125.039 --> 1128.72
because you've never touched upon them

1126.64 --> 1137.8400000000001
but you know they should be out there

1128.72 --> 1137.84
like that right

1138.72 --> 1143.52
but yeah flat side i really don't like

1140.799 --> 1143.52
that sentiment

1146.64 --> 1154.3200000000002
it's by literally that standard

1151.44 --> 1158.0
you and it has happened you could

1154.32 --> 1158.0
interpret jesus the same way

1158.48 --> 1168.72
you know

1165.28 --> 1172.559
if yeah it's it's a

1168.72 --> 1176.16
it's a technicality but yeah it's there

1172.559 --> 1176.96
right so jesus was basically addressed

1176.16 --> 1180.559
even as

1176.96 --> 1182.0
god in ways right he had issues with

1180.559 --> 1184.32
that and he explained why

1182.0 --> 1185.2
like you don't worship a person worship

1184.32 --> 1188.8799999999999
the creator

1185.2 --> 1192.4
like that but yet it did happen

1188.88 --> 1196.48
so isn't that kind of

1192.4 --> 1199.52
like yeah it's the person

1196.48 --> 1202.559
relaying the frequency

1199.52 --> 1204.8799999999999
right well maybe muhammad was

1202.559 --> 1206.24
very similar except i don't know maybe

1204.88 --> 1208.7990000000002
more

1206.24 --> 1210.08
tied into earthly matters more into the

1208.799 --> 1213.28
fray

1210.08 --> 1214.799
of humanity over there so he had like a

1213.28 --> 1216.32
different type of insight

1214.799 --> 1218.48
different types of responses and

1216.32 --> 1219.039
strategies that would unfold from all

1218.48 --> 1222.08
that

1219.039 --> 1225.6
if you ever realize that i i just

1222.08 --> 1226.08
every time people say oh this one is

1225.6 --> 1228.48
right

1226.08 --> 1230.72
and the other ones are all satan look at

1228.48 --> 1232.64
the elements i recognize it yeah

1230.72 --> 1234.0
have you tried that with the thing you

1232.64 --> 1236.159
actually do believe in

1234.0 --> 1237.52
because i'm pretty sure you can also do

1236.159 --> 1240.64
it to that as well

1237.52 --> 1242.799
and then everything is negated so why

1240.64 --> 1244.48
don't you get real

1242.799 --> 1249.84
go with the frequency not with the

1244.48 --> 1249.84
exotarix it never helps

1250.18 --> 1253.249
[Music]

1257.66 --> 1268.159
[Music]

1265.84 --> 1268.1589999999999
right

1272.48 --> 1275.6
have you ever considered by the way flat

1274.72 --> 1279.679
side

1275.6 --> 1284.08
right just like i'm trying to

1279.679 --> 1287.2
walk my own conceived path of christ

1284.08 --> 1290.72
my way how i think i should do it

1287.2 --> 1293.76
how i should be christian that maybe

1290.72 --> 1296.88
i don't know jesus at the time read the

1293.76 --> 1296.8799999999999
old testament

1297.28 --> 1301.28
ever considered that maybe he just

1298.88 --> 1303.1200000000001
thought i'm going to be that guy

1301.28 --> 1306.08
is i don't know it sounds blasphemous

1303.12 --> 1310.559
when i put it like that but

1306.08 --> 1319.84
yeah see see it's all it's all

1310.559 --> 1319.84
bias oh bias

1336.64 --> 1343.1200000000001
reptilian roots in christianity oh god

1340.32 --> 1345.4399999999998
yeah they have to try but i've been

1343.12 --> 1349.039
predicting this look since

1345.44 --> 1352.48
since christianity in general for some

1349.039 --> 1356.559
reason it above the other things is so

1352.48 --> 1360.799
hated by yeah the marxism

1356.559 --> 1363.36
a moral mindset worlds that creepy [ __ ]

1360.799 --> 1365.9189999999999
that includes satanism and they drew in

1363.36 --> 1366.4799999999998
islam or like weaponized islam i don't

1365.919 --> 1369.6000000000001
think that's

1366.48 --> 1372.159
islam islam would absolutely reject

1369.6 --> 1372.8799999999999
everything leftist if they realize what

1372.159 --> 1375.3600000000001
that is

1372.88 --> 1377.3600000000001
so it's corrupted version just like

1375.36 --> 1380.32
gonna have corrupted jews corrupted

1377.36 --> 1380.32
christians all that

1386.84 --> 1391.12
right

1388.0 --> 1395.2
they want

1391.12 --> 1398.559
to basically turn christianity

1395.2 --> 1400.4
into virtual satanism

1398.559 --> 1402.96
they want to turn it inside out the

1400.4 --> 1405.44
whole thing it's kind of like

1402.96 --> 1406.08
what the talmud originally kind of set

1405.44 --> 1409.679
out to do

1406.08 --> 1412.48
in a way well they want to overlay this

1409.679 --> 1413.679
covertly into the public consciousness

1412.48 --> 1417.039
so that people will

1413.679 --> 1421.919
really think like christianity is

1417.039 --> 1421.919
covert satanism it's like an accident

1422.0 --> 1428.0
that got out of control

1425.2 --> 1428.8400000000001
like they want to see christianity like

1428.0 --> 1431.84
a

1428.84 --> 1435.039
spell when they themselves are

1431.84 --> 1436.799
absolutely probably under spells all

1435.039 --> 1440.72
over the place

1436.799 --> 1445.12
constantly lying to themselves so

1440.72 --> 1447.84
that's what they want to do with it

1445.12 --> 1449.6
and yeah i felt that coming even

1447.84 --> 1451.039
throughout my visions it it kind of

1449.6 --> 1453.12
terrified me because

1451.039 --> 1454.32
i remember in the end i would argue that

1453.12 --> 1455.9189999999999
i'm a christian

1454.32 --> 1458.32
and then they would say okay so that

1455.919 --> 1460.7990000000002
means you're satanist

1458.32 --> 1462.24
now that was probably an esoteric

1460.799 --> 1465.2
reflection not something that

1462.24 --> 1466.64
literally happened but it's kind of i

1465.2 --> 1469.039
don't know in ways you know when you

1466.64 --> 1472.88
deal with

1469.039 --> 1474.8799999999999
like leftist marxists like those types

1472.88 --> 1476.88
and you do bring up your christian it's

1474.88 --> 1478.48
almost like they do consider you a

1476.88 --> 1481.5200000000002
satanist they

1478.48 --> 1485.3600000000001
respond to you like christians

1481.52 --> 1487.84
way back 100 years ago would respond to

1485.36 --> 1487.84
leftists

1488.4 --> 1494.96
like you're wrong this is satanic now

1492.24 --> 1495.76
in general christianity has been so

1494.96 --> 1499.8400000000001
mellowed

1495.76 --> 1501.6
down diffused of its passion and

1499.84 --> 1503.84
strictness and all that

1501.6 --> 1505.4399999999998
become ultra liberal and tolerant and

1503.84 --> 1509.1999999999998
diffusing it completely in

1505.44 --> 1509.2
on general in general on average

1513.039 --> 1516.64
now with the rules seem to have been

1514.559 --> 1518.3999999999999
reversed because every time i wanted to

1516.64 --> 1521.1200000000001
share with somebody i'm a christian i

1518.4 --> 1521.52
really have to be kind of careful

1521.12 --> 1524.7199999999998
because

1521.52 --> 1527.039
if they have a lot of deep liberal

1524.72 --> 1529.84
programming they will suddenly become

1527.039 --> 1530.1589999999999
potentially hostile or simply not trust

1529.84 --> 1532.799
me

1530.159 --> 1534.0800000000002
anymore to the level that they have the

1532.799 --> 1536.72
feeling that they have to

1534.08 --> 1537.9189999999999
keep secrets from me seriously i've seen

1536.72 --> 1540.64
it

1537.919 --> 1543.1200000000001
so that makes me nervous and gives me

1540.64 --> 1545.6000000000001
the feeling that they want to basically

1543.12 --> 1547.279
continue the reversed world process and

1545.6 --> 1550.1589999999999
literally turn

1547.279 --> 1551.919
christianity no more secret but overtly

1550.159 --> 1556.4
into satanism where they will

1551.919 --> 1559.2
say it is satanism

1556.4 --> 1561.039
that it is the actual satanism and

1559.2 --> 1564.0800000000002
technically the funny thing is

1561.039 --> 1567.52
in a way it is it is the satanism

1564.08 --> 1570.48
to satanism isn't that ironic

1567.52 --> 1572.32
yeah it is exactly reversed world so

1570.48 --> 1575.1200000000001
it's slowly logical that

1572.32 --> 1577.039
they would reverse everything it yeah

1575.12 --> 1577.6789999999999
that's really the freaky part about it

1577.039 --> 1581.52
all

1577.679 --> 1585.8400000000001
to them it will be exactly like that

1581.52 --> 1585.84
in that spell

1587.279 --> 1593.279
no mr jones christianity is simply

1590.96 --> 1595.039
transforming it's not exactly what it

1593.279 --> 1598.559
used to be

1595.039 --> 1602.72
it's transiting from a

1598.559 --> 1606.24
a herd religion into an individualist

1602.72 --> 1608.64
religion it's a lot of christianity

1606.24 --> 1609.2
embracer within the libertarian movement

1608.64 --> 1611.279
as well

1609.2 --> 1612.72
not all of it also atheists in there and

1611.279 --> 1616.72
everything

1612.72 --> 1619.919
but no it's just that

1616.72 --> 1619.919
kind of the churches

1620.0 --> 1623.279
yeah there's problem with the churches

1621.919 --> 1624.3200000000002
because the people in control of the

1623.279 --> 1628.08
churches have been

1624.32 --> 1630.48
seduced from all sides with money and

1628.08 --> 1630.48
power

1630.96 --> 1637.3600000000001
and yeah that's a problem

1635.279 --> 1638.48
because basically so the original

1637.36 --> 1640.24
foundations

1638.48 --> 1641.84
that made it work have been corrupted

1640.24 --> 1643.44
but that doesn't mean that christianity

1641.84 --> 1646.1589999999999
itself is corrupted and a lot of people

1643.44 --> 1648.64
recognize that step away from that

1646.159 --> 1651.2
and literally become their own christian

1648.64 --> 1654.0
very seriously much more seriously

1651.2 --> 1656.64
than just general heard christians that

1654.0 --> 1659.44
just go to churches ever were

1656.64 --> 1661.44
so no it's actually evolving it's

1659.44 --> 1664.24
evolving

1661.44 --> 1666.48
into a much more serious personal

1664.24 --> 1670.3990000000001
religion which it was always meant to be

1666.48 --> 1674.32
even by christ's own descriptions

1670.399 --> 1679.039
so totally disagree there mr jones

1674.32 --> 1679.039
christianity is about as dead as flat

1680.84 --> 1685.1999999999998
earth

1682.96 --> 1686.159
and even before flat earth christianity

1685.2 --> 1690.64
was already

1686.159 --> 1693.44
going into a revival bloom

1690.64 --> 1693.44
for some time

1693.76 --> 1696.96
because it did kind of break down had a

1695.6 --> 1700.6399999999999
cultural breakdown

1696.96 --> 1703.919
in mid 20th century or late 20th century

1700.64 --> 1711.8400000000001
it really just crumbled under the

1703.919 --> 1711.8400000000001
pressure of the media and all that

1713.84 --> 1718.559
the media basically divided it in evil

1717.279 --> 1722.32
naughty christians

1718.559 --> 1724.559
and good citizen [ __ ] christians

1722.32 --> 1726.24
that they can think whatever the [ __ ]

1724.559 --> 1728.24
they want as long as they do exactly

1726.24 --> 1732.0
what the media wants them to do

1728.24 --> 1734.0
that yeah that happened

1732.0 --> 1736.32
happened late 20th century especially in

1734.0 --> 1736.32
europe

1737.52 --> 1742.6399999999999
and yeah there's been a response to that

1740.48 --> 1745.3600000000001
outrage from people that actually

1742.64 --> 1747.5200000000002
take the bible serious from their own

1745.36 --> 1750.399
volition

1747.52 --> 1751.44
and they have attempted a revival

1750.399 --> 1755.9189999999999
movement

1751.44 --> 1758.159
through the internet too a decentralized

1755.919 --> 1759.44
revival movement by going through

1758.159 --> 1762.5590000000002
christianity again

1759.44 --> 1766.159
figuring it out basically taking

1762.559 --> 1769.36
taking claim of priesthood

1766.159 --> 1772.88
knowing it themselves not resorting to

1769.36 --> 1775.039
a official priest to tell you everything

1772.88 --> 1778.72
or even explain what things mean now

1775.039 --> 1781.76
figuring it out yourself that revival

1778.72 --> 1785.3600000000001
that's real it's pretty far spread

1781.76 --> 1785.36
it's not just the united states

1792.799 --> 1796.96
and by the way also at the same time in

1794.88 --> 1799.7600000000002
the united states

1796.96 --> 1800.72
the herd christians have also bloomed a

1799.76 --> 1803.76
lot

1800.72 --> 1805.2
because there's a lot of it still but

1803.76 --> 1809.84
again yeah that's

1805.2 --> 1812.24
in i consider that corrupted

1809.84 --> 1812.8799999999999
too much money too much power too much

1812.24 --> 1816.3990000000001
control

1812.88 --> 1819.5200000000002
top down from within

1816.399 --> 1823.52
and from outside towards it

1819.52 --> 1824.08
it's not christian people may think it

1823.52 --> 1827.039
is

1824.08 --> 1828.559
it does echo the sentiments but it

1827.039 --> 1831.84
doesn't really teach

1828.559 --> 1833.36
anyone anything really

1831.84 --> 1835.52
because that is what is really about

1833.36 --> 1838.399
teaching ascending in

1835.52 --> 1839.76
insight understanding learning becoming

1838.399 --> 1843.039
a better person

1839.76 --> 1845.6
and by doing that being able to do

1843.039 --> 1847.039
the same to everyone else around you and

1845.6 --> 1851.84
that way

1847.039 --> 1851.84
yeah make the world a better place

1854.159 --> 1857.8400000000001
you know that thing that late 20th

1857.279 --> 1861.44
century

1857.84 --> 1864.48
also the liberal media tried to

1861.44 --> 1867.1200000000001
take over and assume as their own like

1864.48 --> 1867.919
no we want to make the world a better

1867.12 --> 1870.6789999999999
place

1867.919 --> 1872.96
no we're the ones that do that we're

1870.679 --> 1875.8400000000001
environmentalists and we're all

1872.96 --> 1878.0
for social equality and we're the ones

1875.84 --> 1880.0
making the world a better place

1878.0 --> 1881.519
not that stupid christianity they're

1880.0 --> 1886.399
just archaic

1881.519 --> 1886.3990000000001
yeah yeah yeah that happened

1889.76 --> 1896.399
and now they've amassed themselves

1893.6 --> 1897.12
showing that no they didn't actually

1896.399 --> 1899.1999999999998
want to help

1897.12 --> 1902.2399999999998
people then the world made it a better

1899.2 --> 1906.0800000000002
place they just wanted to take control

1902.24 --> 1909.1200000000001
and basically force

1906.08 --> 1912.24
a cohesion on

1909.12 --> 1915.12
everyone in what they should think

1912.24 --> 1916.48
would be the best for the world com it

1915.12 --> 1921.5189999999998
turned into a complete

1916.48 --> 1923.3600000000001
mind control project

1921.519 --> 1926.0
and all their old principles and even

1923.36 --> 1927.76
their care their caretaker role

1926.0 --> 1930.399
that they basically assigned to

1927.76 --> 1932.8799999999999
themselves they have abandoned they have

1930.399 --> 1933.76
neglected it they've neglected the

1932.88 --> 1936.24
environment they

1933.76 --> 1939.36
neglected the welfare of people they are

1936.24 --> 1941.039
neglecting all the things that they said

1939.36 --> 1943.84
they would champion they would take care

1941.039 --> 1947.519
of it now they got it and now they're

1943.84 --> 1948.6399999999999
[ __ ] everyone over like a bunch of

1947.519 --> 1950.72
demons

1948.64 --> 1952.7990000000002
and people were stupid enough to give

1950.72 --> 1956.96
them the the crown

1952.799 --> 1959.279
right how ironic the crown huh yeah

1956.96 --> 1960.24
now they got the crown and now it's time

1959.279 --> 1965.12
for you all

1960.24 --> 1968.48
to bleed for your stupidity

1965.12 --> 1971.36
and your naivety and

1968.48 --> 1974.0
yeah that includes the deeds that your

1971.36 --> 1976.559
parents have done like 20 years ago 40

1974.0 --> 1981.039
years ago your grandparents yeah yeah

1976.559 --> 1984.1589999999999
now all that stupidity all that idiocy

1981.039 --> 1984.8799999999999
is all coming together they got the

1984.159 --> 1991.279
power

1984.88 --> 1994.3990000000001
and now you're gonna pay

1991.279 --> 1998.399
so get ready it's already underway

1994.399 --> 2005.84
people are paying big time

1998.399 --> 2005.84
it's not over yet

2007.44 --> 2010.589
[Music]

2015.679 --> 2020.3990000000001
hey robin stanley long time now see

2020.72 --> 2036.799
good to see you again

2033.76 --> 2038.24
many churches are just posturing and

2036.799 --> 2040.24
yeah good churches are based on

2038.24 --> 2042.96
redemption i agree it's it's

2040.24 --> 2043.6
it's a very complicated esoteric thing

2042.96 --> 2045.1200000000001
see

2043.6 --> 2047.6
if there is a place that has

2045.12 --> 2049.679
specifically been designated by a group

2047.6 --> 2051.2799999999997
of people this can be anything

2049.679 --> 2053.679
it doesn't even have to be christianity

2051.28 --> 2055.9190000000003
but it works christianity the best

2053.679 --> 2058.159
it's like the one big advantage of of

2055.919 --> 2061.839
the herd christianity system

2058.159 --> 2065.119
with church buildings is that

2061.839 --> 2066.639
if people protect that place designated

2065.119 --> 2069.44
as holy as something

2066.639 --> 2069.9190000000003
where you always do your best to be as

2069.44 --> 2073.44
light

2069.919 --> 2076.3199999999997
as possible be as christian as possible

2073.44 --> 2077.359
then that fills up that room and now if

2076.32 --> 2080.8
i've had a personal

2077.359 --> 2083.679
experience where i was like in real huge

2080.8 --> 2085.28
heartache and up yeah up to

2083.679 --> 2088.8
hallucination levels

2085.28 --> 2089.679
even i i testified that i'd even told

2088.8 --> 2093.119
that on the show

2089.679 --> 2094.7200000000003
that's a long time ago now but

2093.119 --> 2097.04
that was even before i started the

2094.72 --> 2100.16
youtube channel

2097.04 --> 2100.8
and i saw like yeah hallucinations of

2100.16 --> 2103.2799999999997
figures

2100.8 --> 2104.4
from the dark world that should i should

2103.28 --> 2106.8
not be seeing

2104.4 --> 2108.079
that was so messed up so scary i thought

2106.8 --> 2109.8390000000004
i was gonna die i thought

2108.079 --> 2112.079
they were literally gonna pull me into

2109.839 --> 2115.92
hell it was terrifying

2112.079 --> 2117.2000000000003
and i went into the church like really

2115.92 --> 2120.88
like help

2117.2 --> 2123.04
help me that i don't want to do anymore

2120.88 --> 2124.96
i know the medical system will not be

2123.04 --> 2127.2799999999997
able to help me no matter what

2124.96 --> 2128.8
and there's just something wrong

2127.28 --> 2131.92
spiritually

2128.8 --> 2133.28
and i need help and they helped me and

2131.92 --> 2136.32
these people were not

2133.28 --> 2138.6400000000003
master intellects but they had

2136.32 --> 2140.6400000000003
the energy and that's the advantage of

2138.64 --> 2142.839
having a place

2140.64 --> 2144.48
and taking it serious and that light

2142.839 --> 2147.04
energy and that

2144.48 --> 2148.079
yeah redemption it helped me redeem

2147.04 --> 2150.96
myself

2148.079 --> 2152.4
from my own delusion in which i was

2150.96 --> 2156.48
slipping away

2152.4 --> 2156.48
because of the terror

2156.56 --> 2159.839
from the dark world

2160.4 --> 2167.04
and yeah that saved me that

2163.52 --> 2167.839
literally saved me i was very thankful

2167.04 --> 2170.96
and i've been

2167.839 --> 2174.72
going to that church every sunday for

2170.96 --> 2177.76
two years until yeah i kind of

2174.72 --> 2179.7599999999998
became my own christian and became an

2177.76 --> 2182.32
esoteric christian and then it just

2179.76 --> 2183.2000000000003
it conflicted a little too much because

2182.32 --> 2185.52
they have

2183.2 --> 2186.56
kind of weird ideas you know it's a

2185.52 --> 2190.4
mormon church

2186.56 --> 2193.92
so they yeah i i don't agree

2190.4 --> 2195.92
with certain things and i've openly

2193.92 --> 2198.079
discussed that with them

2195.92 --> 2199.44
but they don't like that and it's not

2198.079 --> 2200.079
going to go anywhere they they're not

2199.44 --> 2202.8
going to adapt

2200.079 --> 2205.04
that so they yeah they just accept it as

2202.8 --> 2205.04
is

2205.599 --> 2209.599
although yeah i've had pretty good

2207.599 --> 2212.839
philosophical discussions with them

2209.599 --> 2215.839
on a good level so people are not stupid

2212.839 --> 2215.839
there

2216.56 --> 2221.359
there are there were some pretty smart

2218.24 --> 2221.359
guys in there

2222.24 --> 2229.839
men of all age categories and some of

2225.359 --> 2229.839
them were really wise

2240.839 --> 2243.839
right

2250.4 --> 2254.4
you've got is the creator why did he

2252.4 --> 2257.839
need noah to build the ark

2254.4 --> 2257.839
oh what do you think

2258.72 --> 2271.839
what kind of a question is that

2277.52 --> 2283.04
yeah sorry here we go again but in

2280.079 --> 2285.52
general smoking doesn't really do that

2283.04 --> 2288.72
if the tobacco doesn't really cause

2285.52 --> 2291.2
cancer in my opinion

2288.72 --> 2293.359
it's the other junk and it's the habits

2291.2 --> 2299.359
and it's what you eat

2293.359 --> 2302.4
aside that

2299.359 --> 2305.2
cancer is men inherent everybody is born

2302.4 --> 2307.2000000000003
with at least 20 types of cancer in them

2305.2 --> 2309.2799999999997
at all time because it's an inherent

2307.2 --> 2312.7999999999997
metabolic part of the human body

2309.28 --> 2316.5600000000004
and all living things

2312.8 --> 2319.92
in their ways even freaking trees

2316.56 --> 2324.16
plants okay plants have cancer

2319.92 --> 2326.32
in them yeah because it's a natural part

2324.16 --> 2341.839
of the biological

2326.32 --> 2341.839
system so

2359.2 --> 2362.7999999999997
yeah that's very funny mr jones that's

2361.2 --> 2363.2
what you think right that's what i

2362.8 --> 2366.4
thought

2363.2 --> 2368.0
also 20 years ago that's what i thought

2366.4 --> 2370.8
i don't need to read it i don't need to

2368.0 --> 2374.32
know it i'll just use my intuition

2370.8 --> 2378.32
well guess what if i had known it

2374.32 --> 2381.3590000000004
then i would have not been so easy to

2378.32 --> 2384.88
seduce in yeah

2381.359 --> 2388.7999999999997
dubious things certain things

2384.88 --> 2392.2400000000002
because of my curiosity so

2388.8 --> 2394.2400000000002
i don't know you know you can rely your

2392.24 --> 2397.2799999999997
intuition if you have a

2394.24 --> 2397.9199999999996
proper spectrum to reflect upon but if

2397.28 --> 2400.6400000000003
your

2397.92 --> 2403.119
reflection if your morals are all based

2400.64 --> 2406.7999999999997
on temporary intuitive interpretation

2403.119 --> 2409.76
and then the wider people's ideas

2406.8 --> 2411.76
that's insane you can literally be

2409.76 --> 2414.5600000000004
pulled in any direction

2411.76 --> 2417.119
and you won't even realize it until it's

2414.56 --> 2417.119
too late

2418.48 --> 2428.0
so i i don't recommend that

2425.52 --> 2429.839
right and by the way i don't need a

2428.0 --> 2434.16
bible to tell me how to behave

2429.839 --> 2437.2799999999997
either but i learned a lot from it

2434.16 --> 2438.96
at as to the nature of creation and the

2437.28 --> 2442.2400000000002
response of creation

2438.96 --> 2453.28
to acts and that's really what i focused

2442.24 --> 2456.319
on that's what i saw in there

2453.28 --> 2459.3590000000004
yeah tobacco can be medicinal if formed

2456.319 --> 2459.359
correctly indeed

2461.2 --> 2464.72
but yeah if you're gonna have a smoke

2462.88 --> 2468.2400000000002
stack in your mouth all day long

2464.72 --> 2471.359
yeah that's just gonna directly burden

2468.24 --> 2475.4399999999996
the flesh if you just use it

2471.359 --> 2477.7599999999998
responsibly it's actually medicinal

2475.44 --> 2478.7200000000003
and the anxious a lot of native

2477.76 --> 2481.8390000000004
americans

2478.72 --> 2481.839
knew that

2482.64 --> 2486.48
and that's why they they were not all

2484.72 --> 2490.319
just smoking all day

2486.48 --> 2493.359
no they had special rituals to do that

2490.319 --> 2495.119
they did it periodically because then

2493.359 --> 2498.19
the medicinal effect

2495.119 --> 2499.6800000000003
works out the best and they knew that

2498.19 --> 2501.44
[Music]

2499.68 --> 2503.7599999999998
now doesn't mean that you can't get

2501.44 --> 2504.7200000000003
addicted to tobacco and start smoking

2503.76 --> 2506.4
every day

2504.72 --> 2510.24
but technically that's not how you're

2506.4 --> 2510.2400000000002
supposed to use that medicinally

2518.0 --> 2522.88
yes joanna koala totally agree perfect

2520.72 --> 2525.1189999999997
exactly it's good to be familiar with

2522.88 --> 2528.1600000000003
both sides of the argument regarding

2525.119 --> 2530.1600000000003
origin of life to weigh up real signs

2528.16 --> 2533.68
versus pseudoscience from both

2530.16 --> 2533.68
that's exactly right

2535.599 --> 2541.92
the more i've learned is that it's just

2539.68 --> 2543.359
if you don't even understand the counter

2541.92 --> 2545.839
arguments

2543.359 --> 2546.96
then you cannot progress your own

2545.839 --> 2551.839
understanding of

2546.96 --> 2551.839
your arguments

2562.96 --> 2566.64
yeah well mr jones now you're straw

2565.92 --> 2568.88
manning

2566.64 --> 2570.48
because already said tobacco doesn't

2568.88 --> 2573.76
cause cancer

2570.48 --> 2577.04
it's not the tobacco if you said

2573.76 --> 2580.2400000000002
cigarettes cause cancer then i'd say

2577.04 --> 2582.319
yeah yeah on

2580.24 --> 2584.8799999999997
average with what i know is in

2582.319 --> 2587.54
cigarettes the prefabricated product

2584.88 --> 2589.359
right yeah yeah

2587.54 --> 2593.599
[Music]

2589.359 --> 2596.96
but tobacco itself the leaf

2593.599 --> 2600.77
this no absolutely not

2596.96 --> 2602.8
this is good this is good stuff

2600.77 --> 2606.8
[Music]

2602.8 --> 2610.4
there's no junk in there

2606.8 --> 2610.4
and yeah

2615.119 --> 2621.839
it's been great been using it for half a

2617.839 --> 2621.839
year it has been great

2622.24 --> 2629.04
i i literally feel better in my

2625.76 --> 2631.119
airways than i did when i didn't use

2629.04 --> 2635.839
this type of tobacco and went for just a

2631.119 --> 2635.839
regular one in a package

2638.35 --> 2642.6189999999997
[Music]

2651.359 --> 2657.52
oh yeah here we go again it's like

2654.319 --> 2663.839
having a mosquito in a yurt having

2657.52 --> 2663.839
jones here yeah a little

2666.48 --> 2669.68
but yeah then again we're not trying to

2668.88 --> 2672.6400000000003
sleep

2669.68 --> 2677.839
now are we we're actually trying to have

2672.64 --> 2677.839
a conversation here so

2679.68 --> 2683.2
no you don't make this show

2683.44 --> 2691.839

2696.22 --> 2702.8799999999997
[Music]

2698.64 --> 2706.0789999999997
but you do hand me a lot of things

2702.88 --> 2710.079
remarks claims that i can address and

2706.079 --> 2710.079
refute and that way fill up the show

2716.72 --> 2733.839
but i can still fill up the show even if

2718.56 --> 2733.839
you weren't there though

2738.96 --> 2742.4
thank you for that yeah that's exactly

2741.359 --> 2746.0789999999997
there's a lot of that

2742.4 --> 2748.48
disgusting junk it's in the regular

2746.079 --> 2750.0
cigarettes because they sauce it they do

2748.48 --> 2752.0
all kinds of [ __ ] with that it's

2750.0 --> 2755.119
disgusting

2752.0 --> 2757.92
right regular tobacco

2755.119 --> 2759.04
it might have micro well it might have

2757.92 --> 2761.6800000000003
some traces of

2759.04 --> 2762.56
some of that because of the burning but

2761.68 --> 2766.72
it will not

2762.56 --> 2769.92
be as damaging and it's all natural

2766.72 --> 2775.839
organic compounds because there's

2769.92 --> 2775.839
it's not been chemically treated

2781.68 --> 2786.8799999999997
yeah okay it's time to [ __ ] off now done

2784.88 --> 2789.52
with you

2786.88 --> 2791.04
i don't like your attitude anymore and

2789.52 --> 2793.04
yeah you're not

2791.04 --> 2794.079
really helping my show you're just

2793.04 --> 2797.599
getting

2794.079 --> 2800.96
annoying like a [ __ ] bowler troll

2797.599 --> 2803.599
i'm losing my patience for you

2800.96 --> 2807.04
and if you come here with that attitude

2803.599 --> 2807.04
again the next time you're banned

2814.8 --> 2818.079
and i don't care for your outrage also

2817.28 --> 2820.8
if you give

2818.079 --> 2823.6800000000003
one freaking comment or word of [ __ ]

2820.8 --> 2827.2000000000003
outrage over me timing you out here

2823.68 --> 2830.24
if i see it anywhere in this chat

2827.2 --> 2834.0
in any other chat in a comment i will

2830.24 --> 2834.0
ban you just so you know

2834.4 --> 2838.0
because this is my show and you will do

2837.68 --> 2841.04
as

2838.0 --> 2842.8
i say in my chat

2841.04 --> 2845.839
and if you don't like it then you can

2842.8 --> 2845.8390000000004
[ __ ] off

2846.64 --> 2859.839
my show my rules

2870.839 --> 2876.48
ah

2873.04 --> 2880.11
still feeling hulk win

2876.48 --> 2881.52
oh you you mean that time on the

2880.11 --> 2887.04
[Music]

2881.52 --> 2890.88
on the 24 7 discord

2887.04 --> 2894.079
samson yeah i know i joked about that

2890.88 --> 2896.88
but i did actually go pretty rough

2894.079 --> 2896.88
on there so

2897.28 --> 2901.8390000000004
i don't know if you were there

2917.599 --> 2922.2400000000002
yeah uh george sanford you know funny

2920.64 --> 2925.5989999999997
thing is because of

2922.24 --> 2929.04
yeah because there is still some natural

2925.599 --> 2932.2400000000002
yeah toxins in the burning of a plant

2929.04 --> 2936.64
even tobacco that's why for

2932.24 --> 2939.2
yeah that's why i use these so

2936.64 --> 2940.0789999999997
pieces of paper and inside there is a

2939.2 --> 2943.64
there are

2940.079 --> 2947.04
carbon granules and they filter out

2943.64 --> 2950.8799999999997
specifically the typical tobacco-made

2947.04 --> 2953.119
toxic waste the toxic junk like the tar

2950.88 --> 2954.2400000000002
gets absorbed by it first and foremost

2953.119 --> 2956.96
because that is really the more

2954.24 --> 2958.24
disgusting part also blackens your teeth

2956.96 --> 2960.96
and all that

2958.24 --> 2962.4799999999996
and yeah some of these things you're

2960.96 --> 2964.48
talking about

2962.48 --> 2966.4
that's why i use those filters every

2964.48 --> 2969.2
single time

2966.4 --> 2970.2400000000002
and that way yeah it's really not that

2969.2 --> 2973.7599999999998
bad at all

2970.24 --> 2973.7599999999998
even when i smoke it daily

2974.24 --> 2985.839
so it's all accounted for

2986.0 --> 2993.119
whedon way or the highway yeah

2991.04 --> 2995.119
no it's it's okay it's just that this

2993.119 --> 2998.96
guy you know he's been in my chat

2995.119 --> 3000.96
for for at least two weeks now and he's

2998.96 --> 3002.8
we've had some interesting back and

3000.96 --> 3005.04
forths

3002.8 --> 3005.92
but he's just getting more trollish more

3005.04 --> 3009.119
arrogant

3005.92 --> 3011.6800000000003
and just revealing more disgusting

3009.119 --> 3012.8
habits from his side especially in the

3011.68 --> 3015.68
belief

3012.8 --> 3016.48
sector he's just terrible he's terrible

3015.68 --> 3018.48
he may

3016.48 --> 3020.319
sound like a nice person he may think

3018.48 --> 3022.48
he's moral

3020.319 --> 3026.319
but he's as bad as it gets he's a

3022.48 --> 3028.8
full-on atheist

3026.319 --> 3030.0
person that just everything moral he

3028.8 --> 3033.04
will

3030.0 --> 3036.48
he will just be able to yeah shape it

3033.04 --> 3036.48
into whatever the [ __ ] he wants

3036.64 --> 3043.2799999999997
full-on atheist glober and

3040.0 --> 3045.359
yeah at some point you just have to tell

3043.28 --> 3047.92
them like yeah that's really nice that

3045.359 --> 3052.4
you're comfortable being like that

3047.92 --> 3055.44
it's wrong now get the [ __ ] out

3052.4 --> 3058.7200000000003
get over your mistake or piss off

3055.44 --> 3061.04
because to me it's almost like

3058.72 --> 3062.0789999999997
yeah you're in a classroom and somebody

3061.04 --> 3066.5589999999997
just like

3062.079 --> 3069.6800000000003
kid or whatever just starts to

3066.559 --> 3072.079
i don't know act really weird or start

3069.68 --> 3074.24
shouting at people and then say yeah but

3072.079 --> 3075.6800000000003
in my family we always shout to one

3074.24 --> 3078.5589999999997
another

3075.68 --> 3082.5589999999997
yeah that's just [ __ ] annoying they

3078.559 --> 3086.0
think it's normal it's not normal

3082.559 --> 3097.8390000000004
now he's not doing that

3086.0 --> 3097.839
but yeah that's how i see it

3108.839 --> 3113.44
so

3111.2 --> 3115.5989999999997
hmm yeah hey robin stanley how are you

3113.44 --> 3119.04
doing by the way uh

3115.599 --> 3122.6400000000003
it took you some time to move in your

3119.04 --> 3125.839
new house and get it all sorted i think

3122.64 --> 3130.0789999999997
was a bit of a hassle i take it

3125.839 --> 3130.0789999999997
but you all settled now

3136.839 --> 3141.04
yeah yeah i did tell him

3144.88 --> 3151.599
and yeah he laughed at the notion

3148.48 --> 3153.839
look mr jones

3151.599 --> 3154.6400000000003
you may think you're pretty good for a

3153.839 --> 3157.359
baller

3154.64 --> 3158.5589999999997
right you think you're probably pretty

3157.359 --> 3160.48
decent you've probably

3158.559 --> 3161.599
read a lot of that stuff and you got it

3160.48 --> 3162.559
sorted well

3161.599 --> 3165.28
there's a little thing you're

3162.559 --> 3166.0
overlooking though every single [ __ ]

3165.28 --> 3168.96
aspect of

3166.0 --> 3169.68
your model every single [ __ ] aspect

3168.96 --> 3172.8
has all

3169.68 --> 3176.5589999999997
been clinically and surgically

3172.8 --> 3180.0
debunked categorically on a daily basis

3176.559 --> 3183.8390000000004
for years now there is no

3180.0 --> 3186.4
debate you have no arguments

3183.839 --> 3187.52
you have no grip with your arguments

3186.4 --> 3190.559
there is nothing

3187.52 --> 3191.44
you can do nathan knows this and that's

3190.559 --> 3194.88
why he's just

3191.44 --> 3196.7200000000003
laughing at some stupid atheist baller

3194.88 --> 3199.6800000000003
in a chat somewhere

3196.72 --> 3200.72
that's not man enough to actually face

3199.68 --> 3204.24
him

3200.72 --> 3207.9199999999996
in the heat room but no you have to draw

3204.24 --> 3210.8799999999997
nathan oakley to a special panel

3207.92 --> 3212.559
he doesn't give a [ __ ] buddy he knows

3210.88 --> 3214.7200000000003
every [ __ ] argument

3212.559 --> 3215.6800000000003
you are making you have ever made and

3214.72 --> 3218.8799999999997
you're gonna make

3215.68 --> 3221.2799999999997
just like me because you're a baller and

3218.88 --> 3223.92
you're trapped

3221.28 --> 3226.559
within a confine of information that

3223.92 --> 3227.92
does not allow you to overcome your own

3226.559 --> 3231.6800000000003
mistakes

3227.92 --> 3237.839
so there is no debate

3231.68 --> 3237.839
and now you can [ __ ] off

3242.72 --> 3253.7599999999998
and so can you

3250.65 --> 3253.76
[Music]

3262.839 --> 3268.72
ah

3265.359 --> 3268.72
and soak you

3272.0 --> 3279.839
any more for many more

3282.4 --> 3285.599
besides why would you even want to

3283.92 --> 3289.52
debate nathan

3285.599 --> 3293.2000000000003
when i'm better yes

3289.52 --> 3295.2
i got more range i got more range in my

3293.2 --> 3296.0789999999997
argumentation than nathan it's just that

3295.2 --> 3299.1189999999997
nathan

3296.079 --> 3301.44
is very strict disciplined and

3299.119 --> 3303.52
he has a better grip on the english

3301.44 --> 3304.64
language because he's native english and

3303.52 --> 3307.7599999999998
he has the talent

3304.64 --> 3310.0789999999997
that's where he excels but i am

3307.76 --> 3312.3190000000004
basically going to just yeah be a little

3310.079 --> 3314.48
bit blusterous here and say that i'm

3312.319 --> 3316.079
i have more reach in my argumentation

3314.48 --> 3319.76
than nathan does

3316.079 --> 3321.92
so why would you need to debate him

3319.76 --> 3323.8390000000004
you can debate me you have been trying

3321.92 --> 3326.799
so in my chat

3323.839 --> 3327.68
and now you're banned because you didn't

3326.799 --> 3330.72
learn anything

3327.68 --> 3333.2
you're just red-hairing it

3330.72 --> 3334.24
all the standard tactics and yeah i'm

3333.2 --> 3339.04
done with it

3334.24 --> 3339.04
so done done with it

3341.52 --> 3345.44
there's nothing more useful and

3343.2 --> 3349.839
productive i can squeeze out of you for

3345.44 --> 3349.839
my show

3353.82 --> 3356.969
[Music]

3362.799 --> 3377.839
squish their heads

3389.599 --> 3393.3590000000004
yeah good to see you by the way dank

3395.92 --> 3401.04
man i've held off on banning that guy

3398.559 --> 3402.7200000000003
for so long

3401.04 --> 3405.04
because i've been wanting to kind of ban

3402.72 --> 3408.72
him for a week but he kind of just

3405.04 --> 3412.5589999999997
like started he noticed it and

3408.72 --> 3414.3999999999996
started to just get in between

3412.559 --> 3417.28
but he's never going to go back he was

3414.4 --> 3419.76
never going to go back to quality ever

3417.28 --> 3421.2000000000003
it's just there to do what ballers do

3419.76 --> 3424.0
try to drag you down

3421.2 --> 3425.2
into the [ __ ] realm where they are

3424.0 --> 3428.0
they will destroy

3425.2 --> 3429.7599999999998
every fragment of reality in any way

3428.0 --> 3431.68
they see fit to accomplish it

3429.76 --> 3434.0
and they don't even know it because it's

3431.68 --> 3436.64
purely subconscious driven because they

3434.0 --> 3438.559
have no oversight over reality they're

3436.64 --> 3447.839
stuck in their freaking dream

3438.559 --> 3447.8390000000004
they can't see what they're doing

3451.119 --> 3456.4
now thank you aqua altri i really

3453.68 --> 3456.3999999999996
appreciate that

3457.67 --> 3462.559
[Music]

3459.359 --> 3465.359
yeah indeed

3462.559 --> 3466.1600000000003
although there's no live uh flat earth

3465.359 --> 3468.64
debates

3466.16 --> 3470.3999999999996
over yeah at nathan's right now because

3468.64 --> 3473.5989999999997
it's weekend

3470.4 --> 3476.96
but there's the long reach streams from

3473.599 --> 3480.2400000000002
last from the week

3476.96 --> 3483.52
uh oh by the way there is a ball busters

3480.24 --> 3485.52
this evening and i will be present there

3483.52 --> 3488.96
so yeah make sure to check out quantum

3485.52 --> 3492.319
erasers channel

3488.96 --> 3496.4
be there at visit

3492.319 --> 3499.52
yeah eight o'clock amsterdam times it's

3496.4 --> 3503.839
fine roughly five hours from now if i'm

3499.52 --> 3503.839
not mistaken

3518.0 --> 3522.24
right yeah here we go again and it's

3521.2 --> 3526.16
just

3522.24 --> 3528.0
you know it's yeah robin stanley uh

3526.16 --> 3531.839
it shows five to me but the votes is

3528.0 --> 3534.079
just completely messed up

3531.839 --> 3535.839
i've had really good show with like a

3534.079 --> 3537.8390000000004
very high view count and just

3535.839 --> 3539.7599999999998
numerous amounts of people that i know

3537.839 --> 3541.44
respect in my chat with ranches and

3539.76 --> 3542.2400000000002
everything regular followers and it just

3541.44 --> 3545.52
had

3542.24 --> 3547.2799999999997
one upvote so the whole vote system is

3545.52 --> 3550.0
completely rigged

3547.28 --> 3551.28
but i like to every now and then

3550.0 --> 3555.28
emphasize that

3551.28 --> 3557.6800000000003
to show how badly youtube is generally

3555.28 --> 3560.6400000000003
mismanaging

3557.68 --> 3563.359
the honest statistical workings of their

3560.64 --> 3563.359
apparatus

3563.599 --> 3567.3590000000004
it's just mismanagement and it's on

3566.48 --> 3570.319
purpose

3567.359 --> 3570.839
sure of it manipulation of the stats but

3570.319 --> 3575.92
it's

3570.839 --> 3577.52
literally negligent mismanagement

3575.92 --> 3580.559
that they're not stopping it things that

3577.52 --> 3580.559
are obviously wrong

3585.76 --> 3589.2000000000003
but no doubt it's on purpose no doubt at

3588.0 --> 3591.359
all

3589.2 --> 3593.68
because uh why else it doesn't make any

3591.359 --> 3593.68
sense

3594.559 --> 3599.52
and they just don't want to have some

3597.2 --> 3600.48
kind of association with what i am what

3599.52 --> 3603.68
i do

3600.48 --> 3605.92
with popularity they they can't allow it

3603.68 --> 3606.96
to let that glimpse through to give me

3605.92 --> 3609.599
momentum

3606.96 --> 3611.119
because i'll rip the whole energy fabric

3609.599 --> 3614.799
continuum apart

3611.119 --> 3619.119
when that happens sounds a little

3614.799 --> 3619.119
extreme but yeah

3620.0 --> 3623.359
i'm used to not

3623.52 --> 3628.799
building up popular momentum

3626.799 --> 3632.079
in the past when that happened i i

3628.799 --> 3635.7599999999998
literally stepped away like some

3632.079 --> 3638.319
gothic too much

3635.76 --> 3639.6800000000003
too much enthusiasm too many

3638.319 --> 3642.319
expectations

3639.68 --> 3657.839
now now is different because now i got a

3642.319 --> 3657.839
really serious mission

3660.0 --> 3665.04
you have been to the rodeo no never been

3662.64 --> 3665.04
to one

3665.599 --> 3685.839
i've seen couple on on the screen

3669.52 --> 3685.839
never been to one live

3687.2 --> 3693.2
right well the thing about rodeos is

3690.799 --> 3699.839
in such occasions and what it is what it

3693.2 --> 3699.839
does in the book

3700.96 --> 3704.4
these bulls are well naturally filled

3703.119 --> 3707.44
with them and then they're gonna

3704.4 --> 3710.319
basically like get all angry and

3707.44 --> 3713.28
yeah give much maximum muscle effort

3710.319 --> 3714.96
sweat the [ __ ] out of the place and it's

3713.28 --> 3716.6400000000003
all going to

3714.96 --> 3718.319
all the testosterone is going to start

3716.64 --> 3720.0789999999997
floating in the air and going to excite

3718.319 --> 3723.52
everyone

3720.079 --> 3726.079
so yeah i can imagine

3723.52 --> 3727.2
because even to some extent this happens

3726.079 --> 3728.7200000000003
with horses

3727.2 --> 3731.5989999999997
with male horses when they're like

3728.72 --> 3734.0
really really really like

3731.599 --> 3735.6800000000003
in that mood yeah you just start to

3734.0 --> 3738.72
smell that

3735.68 --> 3740.64
it's weird and bulls are just like

3738.72 --> 3743.9199999999996
famous or infamous for the level of

3740.64 --> 3743.92
testosterone that they have

3744.88 --> 3749.599
so much even that well if i remember

3747.28 --> 3754.079
correctly in medieval times

3749.599 --> 3756.319
they would use bull piss medicinally

3754.079 --> 3756.319
right

3757.359 --> 3761.0389999999998
i think they might still do that in the

3759.359 --> 3763.359
pharmaceutical industry here and there i

3761.039 --> 3763.3590000000004
don't know

3763.839 --> 3767.52
but they used to do that for the

3765.599 --> 3771.76
testosterone and it's

3767.52 --> 3774.4
yeah natural

3771.76 --> 3774.4
abilities

3777.76 --> 3783.44
anyway i don't know how i got to that

3779.599 --> 3787.3590000000004
subject but

3783.44 --> 3787.359
oh yeah that's robin stanley's

3794.839 --> 3797.839
huh

3799.76 --> 3802.079
right

3808.799 --> 3814.64
yeah i agree what i kind of do

3812.319 --> 3816.64
like about rodeos is that at least they

3814.64 --> 3819.2799999999997
don't hurt the bulls

3816.64 --> 3821.359
it's like an honest struggle between man

3819.28 --> 3824.48
and nature in a way

3821.359 --> 3828.16
and that just doesn't make it like as

3824.48 --> 3830.4
dark as like uh yeah matadors and all

3828.16 --> 3830.3999999999996
that

3831.52 --> 3835.44
even though that yeah is kind of like

3834.079 --> 3840.6400000000003
risky it's just

3835.44 --> 3840.64
i don't like the hurting the bull part

3843.2 --> 3847.5989999999997
right here we go again i guess yeah

3845.599 --> 3850.0
that's why i gave the example and i've

3847.599 --> 3850.7200000000003
done horseback riding so i have personal

3850.0 --> 3853.52
experience

3850.72 --> 3855.4399999999996
up close with just noticing that the

3853.52 --> 3857.119
smell of horses and the smell of certain

3855.44 --> 3860.64
horses

3857.119 --> 3867.839
and what that kind of does to your mood

3860.64 --> 3867.839
time to end now no

3868.64 --> 3871.359
what's going on

3872.079 --> 3881.8390000000004
why is youtube sawing

3882.72 --> 3895.839
okay it was just stalling on my side

3914.96 --> 3921.2
never rode horse bucket list

3918.0 --> 3922.64
well mark collard listen

3921.2 --> 3925.0389999999998
there's this thing about horseback

3922.64 --> 3926.72
riding it's pretty strenuous

3925.039 --> 3929.039
and potentially dangerous if you're

3926.72 --> 3930.72
gonna start doing that like later in

3929.039 --> 3933.76
life

3930.72 --> 3935.52
yeah that can be dangerous i know from

3933.76 --> 3938.48
personal experience

3935.52 --> 3940.559
because my mother did that like i

3938.48 --> 3943.92
started horse riding when i was

3940.559 --> 3944.48
eight i was very blessed by my parents

3943.92 --> 3946.88
like that

3944.48 --> 3948.2400000000002
it was a very exhilarating experience to

3946.88 --> 3950.7200000000003
doing that

3948.24 --> 3951.7599999999998
but my eventually my parents also

3950.72 --> 3954.0789999999997
started doing that

3951.76 --> 3956.559
with me and was very amazing just going

3954.079 --> 3959.599
with my family out there

3956.559 --> 3961.92
in the woods even but yeah

3959.599 --> 3964.799
when you're starting do starting to do

3961.92 --> 3965.119
that when you're older yeah you can get

3964.799 --> 3968.16
in

3965.119 --> 3971.6800000000003
serious accidents like my mother

3968.16 --> 3974.0789999999997
had a very painful hernia accident

3971.68 --> 3975.2799999999997
because of falling off a horse because

3974.079 --> 3978.4
when she was

3975.28 --> 3980.48
like 45 i think

3978.4 --> 3983.2000000000003
or 40 maybe even i don't know i don't

3980.48 --> 3983.2
remember exactly

3984.72 --> 3990.64
so yeah 45 somewhere there should be

3988.72 --> 3994.16
right

3990.64 --> 3996.72
but if you learn it earlier in your life

3994.16 --> 3999.5989999999997
then you already know where the strains

3996.72 --> 4001.839
are and your body will kind of help

3999.599 --> 4004.0
so if i'm gonna go horseback riding

4001.839 --> 4006.96
right now because i've had such

4004.0 --> 4007.92
training when i was younger i'm going to

4006.96 --> 4011.119
be i'm going to

4007.92 --> 4014.0
know exactly how i need to be careful

4011.119 --> 4016.6400000000003
in order to avoid injury right but when

4014.0 --> 4019.599
you started later in life

4016.64 --> 4021.1189999999997
you got to like got some get some really

4019.599 --> 4023.52
good guidance

4021.119 --> 4025.2000000000003
because yeah it is potentially dangerous

4023.52 --> 4026.799
if you've never done it before and you

4025.2 --> 4035.839
start to do it later in life

4026.799 --> 4035.839
just i just care about you buddy

4040.72 --> 4044.0789999999997
especially if you got back issues

4042.799 --> 4046.839
horseback riding

4044.079 --> 4049.8390000000004
is not going to be for you trust me on

4046.839 --> 4049.839
this

4058.64 --> 4064.4
oh you have horses dank really

4062.16 --> 4064.3999999999996
huh

4067.28 --> 4069.599
nice

4071.68 --> 4077.839
no oh

4083.82 --> 4089.119
[Music]

4089.28 --> 4092.4
all right right okay

4095.839 --> 4099.92
stiff in the saddles or in the button

4097.52 --> 4099.92
yeah

4102.96 --> 4109.92
yeah it's not unwise to basically

4107.199 --> 4112.08
if you're gonna say like i'm gonna do it

4109.92 --> 4113.839
i'm gonna do horseback riding like every

4112.08 --> 4115.92
week or every two weeks or whatever

4113.839 --> 4118.08
that you're going to do some very

4115.92 --> 4122.159
specific type of muscle

4118.08 --> 4123.359
training for that especially for like

4122.159 --> 4127.5199999999995
the hip region

4123.359 --> 4130.4800000000005
lower back like you need to firm that up

4127.52 --> 4131.1990000000005
if you're gonna start horseback riding

4130.48 --> 4134.239
trust me

4131.199 --> 4134.239
you need to do that

4135.199 --> 4139.2789999999995
because if you don't oh my god it can

4137.92 --> 4141.12
you can just

4139.279 --> 4142.96
think you're having fun and then at some

4141.12 --> 4143.5199999999995
point your back will lock up and you'll

4142.96 --> 4146.4
be in

4143.52 --> 4146.64
misery for like a week or more depending

4146.4 --> 4151.599999999999
on

4146.64 --> 4151.6
your constitution i've had that myself

4156.96 --> 4161.759
unless it's just i don't know walking in

4159.759 --> 4163.92
circles on a pony and that's

4161.759 --> 4166.4
it you know if you're gonna really keep

4163.92 --> 4168.56
it basic kitty style horseback riding

4166.4 --> 4170.239
then yeah

4168.56 --> 4171.679
there's yeah you don't really need to

4170.239 --> 4173.12
train extensively

4171.679 --> 4175.4400000000005
but if you're gonna be like yeah i'm

4173.12 --> 4177.679
going to seriously maneuver and really

4175.44 --> 4180.08
perfect it and even do jumping and stuff

4177.679 --> 4182.4800000000005
yeah you will need some muscle training

4180.08 --> 4182.48
for that

4182.97 --> 4187.52
[Music]

4185.279 --> 4191.92
or yeah if you don't you'll find out

4187.52 --> 4191.92
exactly what muscles you needed to train

4200.84 --> 4203.84
afterwards

4204.239 --> 4207.36
getting a serious dog late in life is

4206.08 --> 4209.44
difficult yeah yeah

4207.36 --> 4210.799999999999
yeah because yeah you need to train them

4209.44 --> 4212.48
when they're youngest and then they have

4210.8 --> 4215.04
all that energy and then you need to

4212.48 --> 4217.599999999999
get along with that energy and if you're

4215.04 --> 4230.64
older then it's too tiresome

4217.6 --> 4237.04
i agree

4230.64 --> 4237.04
hmm large dog person that's awesome

4239.36 --> 4247.759999999999
i like large dogs

4244.159 --> 4247.759999999999
but they are quite a handful

4247.92 --> 4261.18
especially when they're young

4258.04 --> 4261.18
[Music]

4275.84 --> 4279.28
yeah anyway i've always been more of a

4277.28 --> 4281.5199999999995
cat person

4279.28 --> 4281.5199999999995
so

4283.52 --> 4288.080000000001
never been much of dogs i i don't like

4285.92 --> 4289.4400000000005
that you need to walk the dog very early

4288.08 --> 4291.76
i just don't like that

4289.44 --> 4291.759999999999
at all

4293.28 --> 4296.5599999999995
and like i don't know in any family

4295.44 --> 4298.879999999999
situation if

4296.56 --> 4299.6
that would happen or a kid wanted a dog

4298.88 --> 4301.6
or

4299.6 --> 4303.04
my wife wanted a dog i would be like

4301.6 --> 4306.64
yeah that's very nice

4303.04 --> 4308.159
i'm not gonna walk them unless i just

4306.64 --> 4310.56
happen to be you know

4308.159 --> 4312.159
up very early and and i want to do it

4310.56 --> 4314.159000000001
but i'm not gonna be

4312.159 --> 4316.32
stuck with walking the freaking dog

4314.159 --> 4319.28
because you once wanted the dog that's

4316.32 --> 4319.28
never gonna happen

4320.159 --> 4324.4
because i'm not a dog person i'm a cat

4322.8 --> 4326.56
person i'll have a cat and i'll take

4324.4 --> 4329.839999999999
care of that cat

4326.56 --> 4329.84
don't worry about that

4332.64 --> 4339.04
yeah i love all and i love most animals

4336.159 --> 4343.839999999999
too but that doesn't mean that i want to

4339.04 --> 4343.84
take care of them and everything

4356.0 --> 4361.199
yep your son for totally agreed and i've

4358.159 --> 4361.199
been witness to that

4368.84 --> 4371.84
definitely

4372.8 --> 4379.6
yeah women riding horses usually got a

4376.32 --> 4385.84
big ass and that's a good thing

4379.6 --> 4385.84
it's very useful for them

4388.159 --> 4391.44
because you need those muscles

4397.6 --> 4400.88
no but it's not about the hassle of

4400.239 --> 4402.959999999999
having to

4400.88 --> 4405.28
keep him on a leash or whatever aqua

4402.96 --> 4406.4800000000005
alter it's about having to get up super

4405.28 --> 4409.04
early to do that

4406.48 --> 4409.04
every time

4410.32 --> 4414.48
and that if you want want that they'll

4412.48 --> 4415.36
jump on your bed or whatever and start

4414.48 --> 4418.159
whining

4415.36 --> 4418.159
that part

4420.56 --> 4425.1990000000005
because i don't i'm not really an early

4422.48 --> 4430.5599999999995
morning person ever like i can

4425.199 --> 4430.5599999999995
but i get grumpy and then just like

4444.32 --> 4448.719
but yeah i guess that if i'd have like

4447.04 --> 4450.56
if

4448.719 --> 4455.84
if i'd have anything more than just a

4450.56 --> 4455.84
box if i'd have an actual

4456.0 --> 4460.48
house with like a bigger garden and

4458.32 --> 4464.08
really a space

4460.48 --> 4468.0
then then maybe

4464.08 --> 4470.719
having a dog would be an extra

4468.0 --> 4472.64
like if i had a bigger territory that i

4470.719 --> 4474.159
will call my own then having a dog

4472.64 --> 4478.08
suddenly has a

4474.159 --> 4480.5599999999995
unique advantage because they

4478.08 --> 4481.28
also then for you kind of mastered the

4480.56 --> 4483.4400000000005
region they

4481.28 --> 4484.8
dogs always do that they kind of know

4483.44 --> 4486.799999999999
what is yours

4484.8 --> 4488.4800000000005
it's funny how that works and then they

4486.8 --> 4490.08
instinctively become very good

4488.48 --> 4491.919999999999
protectors

4490.08 --> 4494.239
they will feel when somebody's coming an

4491.92 --> 4496.4
outsider and everything it's very useful

4494.239 --> 4498.718999999999
if you got bigger territories to have a

4496.4 --> 4498.719
dog

4504.719 --> 4512.4
what time no it's saturday and

4509.28 --> 4516.4
yeah i'm going on i'm going continuing

4512.4 --> 4516.4
my show for at least another 15 minutes

4522.84 --> 4525.84
so

4533.679 --> 4539.84
ball busters today yep

4550.84 --> 4553.84
mhm

4557.12 --> 4563.04
yeah right but anyway look

4560.239 --> 4564.08
me personally i wouldn't even get a pet

4563.04 --> 4567.12
as long as i

4564.08 --> 4569.5199999999995
would not have some kind of patch of

4567.12 --> 4571.36
dirt that i could call my own even if

4569.52 --> 4575.52
just a small one

4571.36 --> 4578.799999999999
because i i wouldn't want to own a cat

4575.52 --> 4580.080000000001
and not have a piece of dirt and some

4578.8 --> 4582.88
plants and grass

4580.08 --> 4584.08
that you want available for them i i i

4582.88 --> 4587.84
wouldn't

4584.08 --> 4592.159
do that to a cat i wouldn't turn a cat

4587.84 --> 4594.88
into literally a a flat cat

4592.159 --> 4595.44
flat apartment cat like that because

4594.88 --> 4597.52
they get

4595.44 --> 4599.5199999999995
problems and they get psychological

4597.52 --> 4602.080000000001
issues a lot of the times

4599.52 --> 4604.0
i want a cat to experience the full

4602.08 --> 4606.0
force of nature i want them to have

4604.0 --> 4608.96
hunting experience i want them to chew

4606.0 --> 4611.12
grass i want them to [ __ ] in the dirt

4608.96 --> 4611.12
too

4612.8 --> 4616.08
because it's better for them

4616.4 --> 4620.48
now i'd hope they they wouldn't

4618.159 --> 4624.239
basically tear up my garden

4620.48 --> 4624.639999999999
of course but yeah then just give them a

4624.239 --> 4627.919999999999
good

4624.64 --> 4637.84
patch to [ __ ] in you know

4627.92 --> 4637.84
or i don't know

4639.6 --> 4643.120000000001
because yeah most cats really prefer to

4641.679 --> 4648.4
poo outside and not

4643.12 --> 4651.84
in in yeah in pellet filled

4648.4 --> 4651.839999999999
boxes as it were

4670.32 --> 4678.0
a monster lab what

4673.48 --> 4682.0
120 pound monster lap whose

4678.0 --> 4684.32
who what monster lab is a person

4682.0 --> 4684.32
what

4688.719 --> 4695.469
oh labrador for [ __ ] sake

4692.39 --> 4695.469
[Music]

4696.239 --> 4707.839999999999
i thought like what a laboratory

4726.48 --> 4730.0
why is that unfortunately being a good

4729.36 --> 4735.44
mouser

4730.0 --> 4738.96
is great you know how much that helps

4735.44 --> 4742.32
you know how much like mice and [ __ ]

4738.96 --> 4743.84
actually do like yeah they're kind of

4742.32 --> 4746.08
cute maybe

4743.84 --> 4748.88
but seriously they stink up the place

4746.08 --> 4751.12
and they cause allergies they're [ __ ]

4748.88 --> 4753.84
it it kind of like the dust of it it

4751.12 --> 4756.08
spreads around and it causes pretty

4753.84 --> 4757.360000000001
it has allergic influences on your

4756.08 --> 4761.12
system

4757.36 --> 4762.08
my poo is not good i'm very unhappy that

4761.12 --> 4765.44
we have

4762.08 --> 4765.44
freaking mice at this moment

4766.0 --> 4770.159
i don't know what to do about them at

4768.88 --> 4772.8
this point

4770.159 --> 4777.839999999999
they always keep coming back every

4772.8 --> 4777.84
freaking year

4779.199 --> 4782.96
a laboratory retriever

4784.159 --> 4791.839999999999
low that's a good one

4810.56 --> 4819.84
water dog lovers yeah yeah labradors are

4813.92 --> 4819.84
absolutely amazing

4821.36 --> 4829.599999999999
if i'd have a dog and i'd had like cakes

4825.6 --> 4829.6
then i'd probably go for a labrador

4830.56 --> 4835.84
because they are they're often very good

4832.56 --> 4835.84
with kids too little kids

4837.44 --> 4847.839999999999
but yeah i don't know future talk

4849.44 --> 4854.638999999999
oh did i tell everybody that i got a hug

4851.92 --> 4854.639
from a girl

4857.84 --> 4863.28
that was thursday by the way no wait it

4860.159 --> 4866.159
was just it was thursday i don't know

4863.28 --> 4867.36
still kind of dreamy about it but it was

4866.159 --> 4872.08
that same girl the

4867.36 --> 4872.08
the friend from my roommate

4873.04 --> 4881.5199999999995
and i think she yeah she did it

4878.4 --> 4886.0
she came to me for a hug and i was like

4881.52 --> 4888.719
well that is awesome

4886.0 --> 4891.52
so who knows where that goes she's

4888.719 --> 4891.52
really amazing

4896.159 --> 4901.12
even though i think that she thinks

4898.0 --> 4903.199
she's probably a lesbian but

4901.12 --> 4905.44
i don't give a [ __ ] at this point more

4903.199 --> 4907.36
than half my girlfriends have been

4905.44 --> 4909.36
what they thought were lesbians so

4907.36 --> 4911.839999999999
whatever

4909.36 --> 4911.839999999999
we'll see

4913.36 --> 4916.88
i just know i think she's really cute

4915.36 --> 4919.5199999999995
and she is wise

4916.88 --> 4921.84
too wise and smart and she can probably

4919.52 --> 4925.679
actually get to know me without just

4921.84 --> 4928.400000000001
getting terrified and that's a big

4925.679 --> 4928.4
plus for me

4928.88 --> 4931.84
uh

4940.56 --> 4947.6
what the are you talking about

4944.08 --> 4947.6
that sounds really creepy

4949.28 --> 4959.84
here we go again what

4963.36 --> 4972.08
oh you have to finish off the mice oh

4966.719 --> 4976.639
no don't no

4972.08 --> 4977.12
it yeah maybe you'd call it immoral of

4976.639 --> 4981.28
me

4977.12 --> 4983.36
i am like no the cats

4981.28 --> 4985.12
i don't even want to know it but it i

4983.36 --> 4987.12
think it

4985.12 --> 4988.96
it's just that yeah cats freaking

4987.12 --> 4991.599999999999
torture mice to death that's right

4988.96 --> 4992.2390000000005
and then they should just eat them

4991.6 --> 4996.719
because

4992.239 --> 5000.5599999999995
yeah those mice should not be there

4996.719 --> 5004.2390000000005
like go away go away mice

5000.56 --> 5007.6
[ __ ] die piss off so

5004.239 --> 5009.36
yeah i don't know i'm not that

5007.6 --> 5012.0
you know when i was a little kid i

5009.36 --> 5014.799999999999
thought it was horrific to see that

5012.0 --> 5015.28
and hey if they catch a bird oh yeah

5014.8 --> 5017.6
i'll

5015.28 --> 5019.199
jump in there like no way you're not

5017.6 --> 5022.8
gonna kill that bird

5019.199 --> 5025.04
but with mice i'm like nope

5022.8 --> 5026.56
those mice are not supposed to be there

5025.04 --> 5029.84
so yeah

5026.56 --> 5029.84
that's what you get

5032.96 --> 5036.96
right my cat eats them zero cleanup yeah

5035.12 --> 5039.04
yeah well i've met a lot of cats that do

5036.96 --> 5042.08
that it's very typical that they

5039.04 --> 5044.159
sometimes leave like the liver

5042.08 --> 5045.28
like you don't find anything but you

5044.159 --> 5048.4
find like this

5045.28 --> 5049.84
very small intestine with a piece of

5048.4 --> 5050.799999999999
liver and that's the only thing they

5049.84 --> 5054.4800000000005
leave behind it's

5050.8 --> 5055.12
weird how precise that every time

5054.48 --> 5057.28
happens

5055.12 --> 5059.04
for some reason they do that they leave

5057.28 --> 5061.5199999999995
certain organs out it's like almost like

5059.04 --> 5064.239
they're like surgically precise

5061.52 --> 5064.2390000000005
so bizarre

5066.0 --> 5071.84
yeah they leave the poo right

5072.32 --> 5076.88
oh they leave injured my yeah that is

5074.08 --> 5076.88
kind of horrific

5078.639 --> 5083.12
i don't know yeah i i haven't met cats

5081.679 --> 5086.2390000000005
that do that

5083.12 --> 5086.239
that is pretty gruesome

5086.32 --> 5090.239
that's and bizarre like what cat would

5088.32 --> 5091.12
get bored with the mice that's still

5090.239 --> 5093.12
alive

5091.12 --> 5094.96
unless of course they want to teach you

5093.12 --> 5097.04
how to hunt because they think

5094.96 --> 5098.56
they need assistance in catching mice

5097.04 --> 5100.8
they do that

5098.56 --> 5102.719
they drop them to your feet sometimes

5100.8 --> 5105.4400000000005
still

5102.719 --> 5107.36
dizzy moving because they're like hello

5105.44 --> 5108.799999999999
when are you finally gonna learn to

5107.36 --> 5112.4
haunt mice like me

5108.8 --> 5114.719
i need assistance

5112.4 --> 5114.719
really

5118.639 --> 5127.84
it gets them from the field right

5132.32 --> 5135.679
yeah they do do that indeed

5136.32 --> 5139.5199999999995
although eventually if the same cat does

5138.56 --> 5142.320000000001
that

5139.52 --> 5143.280000000001
and you yeah you get pissed off or you

5142.32 --> 5145.44
simply

5143.28 --> 5147.199
make it clear that you don't like that

5145.44 --> 5150.799999999999
eventually they will stop

5147.199 --> 5153.199
but a lot of cats that do hunt mice

5150.8 --> 5154.88
naturally they do typically do that to

5153.199 --> 5168.799999999999
people as well

5154.88 --> 5171.84
and to other cats i've seen that as well

5168.8 --> 5177.04
laboratory receiver they got no science

5171.84 --> 5177.04
nice nice writing that's that's

5180.84 --> 5183.84
amazing

5194.84 --> 5197.84
so

5209.12 --> 5213.5199999999995
yeah they got no science indeed they're

5211.76 --> 5215.6
not

5213.52 --> 5219.120000000001
they're not moving beyond just

5215.6 --> 5219.120000000001
structural speculation

5219.28 --> 5224.639
and that's it they don't want to test it

5222.8 --> 5226.400000000001
because then it figured out it doesn't

5224.639 --> 5229.52
work

5226.4 --> 5232.719
i only want to test it in ways

5229.52 --> 5234.400000000001
that it can work and or that they won't

5232.719 --> 5236.2390000000005
figure out that it doesn't work

5234.4 --> 5237.44
that's the only way they want to test

5236.239 --> 5240.48
things

5237.44 --> 5242.879999999999
about their beliefs because the main

5240.48 --> 5253.839999999999
objective is to uphold the belief

5242.88 --> 5253.84
first first you know so

5264.84 --> 5267.84
hmm

5269.2 --> 5274.96
[Music]

5271.84 --> 5276.88
never know well look i i

5274.96 --> 5278.4
say these things with such confidence in

5276.88 --> 5281.28
detail because i was

5278.4 --> 5283.44
literally there i was locked into baller

5281.28 --> 5287.28
mindset

5283.44 --> 5289.839999999999
and that was pretty bad

5287.28 --> 5290.5599999999995
in my late teens early 20s like pretty

5289.84 --> 5292.84
bad i was

5290.56 --> 5294.159000000001
locked in that people would literally

5292.84 --> 5296.719
dispel

5294.159 --> 5297.599999999999
the globe arguments like we guys are

5296.719 --> 5301.679
kind of doing

5297.6 --> 5305.280000000001
now back then to me

5301.679 --> 5308.2390000000005
and i would give a hundred times

5305.28 --> 5309.5199999999995
more constructive more elusive more

5308.239 --> 5312.5599999999995
effective

5309.52 --> 5313.280000000001
counter response as a baller believing

5312.56 --> 5316.56
it

5313.28 --> 5318.239
than i've ever heard a single baller

5316.56 --> 5321.679
here out there on the internet

5318.239 --> 5324.638999999999
ever i've said things as a baller that

5321.679 --> 5327.28
even blow my own mind to this day when i

5324.639 --> 5327.28
remember it

5330.88 --> 5334.08
because that's what happens

5335.76 --> 5340.639
and yeah your intelligence just goes

5338.719 --> 5344.159
with it

5340.639 --> 5347.1990000000005
to wherever but yeah i'd like to think

5344.159 --> 5351.28
to be real and meaningful and not just

5347.199 --> 5352.0
a quick get out to move on to the next

5351.28 --> 5354.4
subject

5352.0 --> 5356.08
because that is a complete waste of time

5354.4 --> 5358.32
and energy to me

5356.08 --> 5360.0
even from a religious perspective from

5358.32 --> 5362.32
the body perspective it's a waste of

5360.0 --> 5364.48
time it's embarrassing

5362.32 --> 5366.239
i was literally sitting there being

5364.48 --> 5367.28
embarrassed that everybody that was

5366.239 --> 5370.4
working on that was a

5367.28 --> 5373.36
[ __ ] [ __ ] why

5370.4 --> 5374.638999999999
why are you so stupid why can't we just

5373.36 --> 5377.599999999999
build the real

5374.639 --> 5379.28
science to to figure out how the ball

5377.6 --> 5382.400000000001
works

5379.28 --> 5383.5199999999995
instead of this these stupid little

5382.4 --> 5386.32
things that are just

5383.52 --> 5388.56
nonsense i was really disappointed by

5386.32 --> 5388.5599999999995
that

5388.719 --> 5392.0
i thought they want i thought they did

5391.04 --> 5395.679
it on purpose

5392.0 --> 5397.199
to destroy the ball evidence

5395.679 --> 5400.4
this is what i thought back then i

5397.199 --> 5404.0
thought they were literally

5400.4 --> 5405.679
just destroying our minds by trying to

5404.0 --> 5408.32
make everything so stupid and

5405.679 --> 5411.679
nonsensical that even though it was real

5408.32 --> 5414.159
so i thought i felt we would never

5411.679 --> 5415.12
even know why anymore that's what i

5414.159 --> 5417.12
thought back then

5415.12 --> 5419.12
that's how i regarded nasa too like

5417.12 --> 5421.44
these are mind destroyers they're trying

5419.12 --> 5423.92
to make us so dumb so we

5421.44 --> 5425.28
literally can't understand reality

5423.92 --> 5434.88
anymore

5425.28 --> 5440.239
how i was right i just didn't know how

5434.88 --> 5440.2390000000005
isn't that amazing in retrospect

5441.76 --> 5446.0
right i'm going to write out the round

5444.08 --> 5449.36
out the show guys

5446.0 --> 5451.52
it's been pretty good if you guys

5449.36 --> 5453.44
liked it as well guys and else then

5451.52 --> 5455.280000000001
please don't forget to rogan's it up and

5453.44 --> 5458.0
