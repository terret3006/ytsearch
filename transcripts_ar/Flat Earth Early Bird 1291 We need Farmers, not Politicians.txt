whether

94.64 --> 96.88
they

97.119 --> 101.68
has been extremely beautiful although

99.36 --> 103.04
there seems to be a pretty big cloud

101.68 --> 106.0
right now

103.04 --> 106.0
above me

106.72 --> 108.96
but

109.52 --> 114.15899999999999
it's been like half and half

112.0 --> 116.88
blue sky

114.159 --> 118.32000000000001
and clouds

116.88 --> 120.399
it's

118.32 --> 122.39899999999999
quite warm as well

120.399 --> 125.36
and the wind is just like delightful

122.399 --> 128.64
it's a nice type of wind not

125.36 --> 131.679
too cold not too warm it's it's really

128.64 --> 131.67899999999997
great weather outside

138.16 --> 143.48
plenty of sun

140.0 --> 143.48
plenty of green

153.12 --> 157.56
low psych bear first in chat

158.8 --> 162.239
how am i doing i'm doing great

167.599 --> 172.56
yeah no i am doing great because

170.239 --> 174.04
yesterday i basically

172.56 --> 177.36
did some

174.04 --> 178.64
administration level work

177.36 --> 180.959
[Music]

178.64 --> 185.23899999999998
with like my financial situation and

180.959 --> 185.239
turned out i was actually

185.92 --> 190.319
kind of lucky

187.599 --> 194.72
because because i wrote here it goes

190.319 --> 196.48
because i now reported my google income

194.72 --> 199.76
i got some money back

196.48 --> 200.879
because i basically report a standard

199.76 --> 203.84
rate

200.879 --> 206.959
right which they with tracked

203.84 --> 208.48
from my welfare check

206.959 --> 210.31900000000002
and then i have to report how much i

208.48 --> 212.159
actually got and i hadn't done that in a

210.319 --> 214.319
long time weirdly didn't have any

212.159 --> 217.12
reminders of it usually i get a reminder

214.319 --> 217.11999999999998
every three months

217.76 --> 222.159
didn't have any this

219.599 --> 224.48
time since like

222.159 --> 226.72
december last year

224.48 --> 229.44
so i did that and

226.72 --> 233.35999999999999
like the next day today i i got some

229.44 --> 236.64
money back so i'm like oh thank god

233.36 --> 239.84
on top of like the super the super chats

236.64 --> 242.95899999999997
the donations from you guys

239.84 --> 245.36
so i'm okay for at least like a while a

242.959 --> 247.76
little while it was just

245.36 --> 249.92000000000002
something i didn't expect

247.76 --> 251.2
that it would work out

249.92 --> 252.319
this quickly

251.2 --> 255.439
so

252.319 --> 258.959
yeah i'm relieved

255.439 --> 261.519
yesterday it was a great day

258.959 --> 263.84000000000003
like the flat earth debates was

261.519 --> 265.12
incredibly long

263.84 --> 266.84
it was like

265.12 --> 269.52
four maybe five

266.84 --> 271.59999999999997
hours all together like

269.52 --> 273.59999999999997
at the end i didn't even hung around

271.6 --> 277.6
anymore because it was just

273.6 --> 277.6
nathan was just really going at it

279.44 --> 282.68
with the

283.6 --> 287.6
with this one guy once again

290.32 --> 294.71999999999997
what was it about again it was about

292.4 --> 296.56
celestial navigation i think

294.72 --> 298.47900000000004
it was about a lot of things it was a

296.56 --> 301.28000000000003
great show

298.479 --> 304.0
but i i missed the end part of the after

301.28 --> 304.0
show recording

304.32 --> 306.639
uh

309.12 --> 314.96
it's 23 degrees celsius

312.56 --> 318.08
over here

314.96 --> 320.4
yeah i was watching own benjamin

318.08 --> 323.12
from

320.4 --> 323.12
thursday

323.44 --> 328.32
and

324.96 --> 328.32
like that was really great

330.56 --> 335.039
like

332.24 --> 336.84000000000003
he basically i don't think i didn't

335.039 --> 339.919
watch the entire thing i'm not entirely

336.84 --> 343.59999999999997
sure but he brought up also like the

339.919 --> 343.59999999999997
dutch farmers and that was like

343.919 --> 346.96
like that was awesome

349.36 --> 352.639
there's not a lot of mentioning of of

351.36 --> 354.88
the dutch

352.639 --> 358.759
in own benjamin and to hear that from

354.88 --> 358.759
it's just it was great

369.28 --> 373.11999999999995
oh hello by the way mike siddinich

371.759 --> 375.759
rick beck

373.12 --> 375.759
good to see you

377.44 --> 383.71999999999997
yeah it is saturday the 2nd of july 2022

388.96 --> 393.96
hello youtube yes you are there

397.58 --> 400.64
[Music]

402.9 --> 406.09999999999997
[Music]

406.84 --> 412.23999999999995
hmm but yes right back it was a huge

410.319 --> 414.0
weight off my shoulders

412.24 --> 416.40000000000003
although i think i could have still like

414.0 --> 419.44
made it with you guys

416.4 --> 419.44
but it's just like

420.56 --> 424.639
it was especially really the sudden

422.479 --> 426.4
turnaround realization

424.639 --> 428.0
of like oh [ __ ]

426.4 --> 430.15999999999997
so early in the month and suddenly

428.0 --> 432.8
nothing it's like oh no

430.16 --> 434.40000000000003
like a little panic financial panic and

432.8 --> 436.8
to then

434.4 --> 438.96
basically having responded to it as well

436.8 --> 441.919
as i could and it working out

438.96 --> 443.84
immediately that's just like

441.919 --> 447.12
wow

443.84 --> 449.35999999999996
that is like a huge relief

447.12 --> 450.96
because now the panic didn't basically

449.36 --> 454.08000000000004
set root

450.96 --> 454.08
very happy about that

458.319 --> 462.88
right also i banned somebody yesterday

460.56 --> 464.56
apparently

462.88 --> 466.479
weird name

464.56 --> 469.44
who basically popped up in the middle of

466.479 --> 472.0
like a deluge of derps rolling into my

469.44 --> 475.759
chat and abandoned but he hey

472.0 --> 477.12
you you should know this about me

475.759 --> 479.12
and just

477.12 --> 480.96
address me in another chat like flat

479.12 --> 484.4
earth debates and say like hey i think

480.96 --> 484.4
you banned me by accident and

484.479 --> 488.15999999999997
yeah and i did unban him so he should be

486.72 --> 489.759
able to

488.16 --> 493.639
get back in

489.759 --> 493.639
if he feels like it

495.44 --> 497.68
ah

501.44 --> 505.759
but yeah when when the trolls are

503.68 --> 508.08
barraging my chat with constant sock

505.759 --> 512.399
accounts and that's the moment

508.08 --> 516.0799999999999
that you choose to pop up and say hello

512.399 --> 518.399
right that's kind of danger that's like

516.08 --> 521.12
running in the middle of a killing field

518.399 --> 523.039
like on a diplomatic mission like oh

521.12 --> 524.9590000000001
gotta tell them hi

523.039 --> 526.8
we're in the middle of like

524.959 --> 529.04
a shootout we're getting swarmed right

526.8 --> 532.24
now you're gonna get caught up in the

529.04 --> 533.1999999999999
fire basically that that's what happened

532.24 --> 536.32
but

533.2 --> 538.6400000000001
thankfully i can just unban them

536.32 --> 541.44
revive them as it were

538.64 --> 541.4399999999999
in my chat

546.08 --> 549.839
ah right youtube

552.399 --> 557.92
right seeking story indeed

556.16 --> 560.0799999999999
it's the wrong time to walk into the

557.92 --> 561.8389999999999
saloon it's like oh hi let it get a

560.08 --> 564.32
drink right when there was like a

561.839 --> 564.32
shootout

565.2 --> 570.279
might not be the best time to get inside

583.279 --> 588.0
well it's the right saloon it's just the

585.36 --> 588.0
wrong time

588.48 --> 593.72
i mean it's the wrong saloon for the

590.16 --> 593.7199999999999
trolls right

604.64 --> 607.92
yeah psych bear indeed

610.56 --> 613.68
anyhow

611.839 --> 618.12
i think overall was a pretty good show

613.68 --> 618.12
even though i did get a bit dark again

618.72 --> 622.48
it's just that sometimes they really do

620.959 --> 625.68
bring out just

622.48 --> 625.6800000000001
the worst to me and it's

626.88 --> 631.4399999999999
it's a dangerous balance they even deal

629.12 --> 633.68
with that it's like in a way i don't

631.44 --> 636.0790000000001
want anybody else to see that because

633.68 --> 638.64
it's really directed at them

636.079 --> 641.4399999999999
exclusively and

638.64 --> 644.16
oh if you're going to be unprepared and

641.44 --> 647.2
like halfway sensitive person you might

644.16 --> 649.4399999999999
be like really shocked by that and some

647.2 --> 651.36
of you probably have and gotten used to

649.44 --> 653.44
it but i still feel like i should

651.36 --> 656.16
apologize for that

653.44 --> 659.72
for that effect of my intensity

656.16 --> 659.7199999999999
and going there

660.72 --> 666.24
it's just

662.64 --> 669.4399999999999
i really tried to pick

666.24 --> 672.399
the targets for my hellish wrath very

669.44 --> 675.2790000000001
carefully i would never burn like a

672.399 --> 677.04
an undeserving person like that

675.279 --> 678.959
whether it's on the internet or in real

677.04 --> 681.959
life

678.959 --> 681.959
anyway

690.48 --> 695.6
all right yeah yeah yeah the waves

693.6 --> 697.279
now it was about terrestrial refraction

695.6 --> 698.72
now i remember it wasn't about choreo

697.279 --> 701.4399999999999
this is something no it was about

698.72 --> 705.6
terrestrial refraction

701.44 --> 708.6400000000001
but man that was like a heavy battle

705.6 --> 708.64
it was heavy stuff

709.6 --> 714.72
and he really did

711.44 --> 717.2790000000001
try he did actually try to do it so it's

714.72 --> 720.399
almost like i had to like

717.279 --> 722.639
resonate a little sympathy with my bow

720.399 --> 724.079
inside because it's like pretty rare to

722.639 --> 725.92
see

724.079 --> 727.5999999999999
somebody whether it's an anti-flat

725.92 --> 730.3199999999999
earther or a baller

727.6 --> 733.0400000000001
to really give terrestrial refraction a

730.32 --> 736.0
go logically because it's super

733.04 --> 738.56
difficult but he did actually

736.0 --> 740.32
try to give it a go but then eventually

738.56 --> 742.399
rolled into just the standard

740.32 --> 745.0400000000001
scattergunning

742.399 --> 746.959
format fallacy complaining

745.04 --> 749.12
rumpusing and then shutting up when he's

746.959 --> 752.4799999999999
supposed to be talking right

749.12 --> 753.2
so it did go to [ __ ] eventually

752.48 --> 755.9200000000001
but

753.2 --> 758.32
at first he really was trying to give it

755.92 --> 762.24
a go and i have to respect that no

758.32 --> 762.24
matter how delusional it really is

765.839 --> 768.32
logic

769.04 --> 777.279
it's hilarious seeking star wars

772.88 --> 777.279
should come up with that pretzel logic

781.92 --> 785.639
yeah yeah with the orbits

788.8 --> 791.92
yeah

789.6 --> 795.279
anyway it was a long show and about a

791.92 --> 795.279
lot of different subjects

795.76 --> 800.3199999999999
i laughed through a lot of it

798.24 --> 801.12
tried to stay out of it as much as i

800.32 --> 803.6
could

801.12 --> 805.92
with only like support remarks

803.6 --> 808.639
which are very hard to get in when when

805.92 --> 810.4799999999999
nathan is like rolling

808.639 --> 812.9590000000001
like if you're in the wrong timing he's

810.48 --> 815.12
gonna like try to bite your head off

812.959 --> 817.5999999999999
like which what happens with neil a lot

815.12 --> 819.04
but he was like super silent the entire

817.6 --> 820.9590000000001
show

819.04 --> 823.68
i couldn't remember him like rumpusing

820.959 --> 825.92
even once so i was the wrong [ __ ] that

823.68 --> 825.92
day

826.32 --> 832.839
but he really did my best to like

829.36 --> 832.839
just be strategic

834.1 --> 837.309
[Music]

847.76 --> 852.16
you gotta love that's not to strangle

849.519 --> 854.5600000000001
someone well look speaking style water

852.16 --> 854.56
the thing

854.839 --> 860.0790000000001
is i laugh

857.279 --> 863.519
when nathan's doing that

860.079 --> 865.8389999999999
for a various amount of re like very

863.519 --> 868.16
different reasons

865.839 --> 870.5600000000001
right in a way i'm also laughing at him

868.16 --> 871.68
because he's actually going there like i

870.56 --> 874.079
wouldn't

871.68 --> 876.4799999999999
i wouldn't even want to go that far with

874.079 --> 878.6389999999999
a baller

876.48 --> 880.5600000000001
sometimes i do when it just hap it

878.639 --> 882.839
happens to happen to me right and then

880.56 --> 885.1199999999999
i'll go to like an ethonian like war

882.839 --> 887.519
mode similar

885.12 --> 892.24
to what i do here but different because

887.519 --> 892.24
in here i don't verbally face off

892.32 --> 896.1600000000001
with people

894.399 --> 898.639
not really

896.16 --> 899.6
i do with chat

898.639 --> 901.92
out there

899.6 --> 903.839
like if i ever go on discord and a bump

901.92 --> 906.56
in into people i might do that and i

903.839 --> 908.48
will use nathaniel methods but nathan

906.56 --> 909.76
does it a lot

908.48 --> 911.279
and it's like

909.76 --> 914.0
yeah

911.279 --> 916.48
to me that's not even worth the effort

914.0 --> 917.36
really so i'm also laughing about that a

916.48 --> 919.6800000000001
bit

917.36 --> 920.9590000000001
but then again

919.68 --> 923.199
the laugh

920.959 --> 925.4399999999999
really comes out just

923.199 --> 927.199
realizing how tenacious the ballers are

925.44 --> 930.1600000000001
and that

927.199 --> 931.5999999999999
nathan is basically matching that

930.16 --> 933.92
tenacity

931.6 --> 936.88
but just much more strategically and

933.92 --> 940.4799999999999
just completely judoing the [ __ ] out of

936.88 --> 942.8
the entire situation

940.48 --> 945.12
and that is just

942.8 --> 947.279
hilarious to see a baller

945.12 --> 950.0
being so pick-headed and stubborn and

947.279 --> 951.279
ignorant that even then as they feel

950.0 --> 954.639
like oh

951.279 --> 955.759
i've risen to godhood of the glow or

954.639 --> 958.88
something right

955.759 --> 961.04
it might be not too far off with that

958.88 --> 962.32
and they go at it religiously and then

961.04 --> 964.8
to just

962.32 --> 966.5600000000001
see how utterly

964.8 --> 969.199
wrong they are about everything that

966.56 --> 971.5189999999999
it's all just wrong all of it

969.199 --> 973.8389999999999
and it really is

971.519 --> 975.44
that yeah and i remember even in my

973.839 --> 977.44
youth getting caught up in those

975.44 --> 978.8800000000001
positions being really wrong about

977.44 --> 981.519
something

978.88 --> 983.92
and then just refusing to admit it not

981.519 --> 986.5600000000001
even to the person i was facing but to

983.92 --> 989.759
reality itself and then you get caught

986.56 --> 992.0
up in this weird frequency where just

989.759 --> 994.88
everything that comes out of you is just

992.0 --> 994.88
going to be wrong

994.959 --> 998.7199999999999
and some people when they're stuck in

996.56 --> 1001.5189999999999
that they don't even realize it i would

998.72 --> 1004.639
realize it and it would like really

1001.519 --> 1007.04
make me miserable because it's like [ __ ]

1004.639 --> 1008.9590000000001
i'm really wrong but i really don't want

1007.04 --> 1010.88
to give up but

1008.959 --> 1012.7199999999999
everything that i seem to say just

1010.88 --> 1014.24
doesn't work out and then it's just like

1012.72 --> 1016.5600000000001
[ __ ]

1014.24 --> 1016.5600000000001
[ __ ]

1016.8 --> 1020.639
i'm so glad

1018.88 --> 1023.12
and i've learned to deal with that like

1020.639 --> 1026.72
in the last few decades

1023.12 --> 1029.28
and i don't have that anymore

1026.72 --> 1031.76
i have ways now to basically bypass it

1029.28 --> 1033.6789999999999
in a way i've also kind of connected it

1031.76 --> 1035.76
up with my rage

1033.679 --> 1037.3600000000001
that's a way to bypass it now with most

1035.76 --> 1040.079
people when they connect up with their

1037.36 --> 1043.039
rage like that the rage takes them over

1040.079 --> 1045.039
completely and they lose all control so

1043.039 --> 1047.039
that's never a good thing strategically

1045.039 --> 1050.84
for them to do

1047.039 --> 1054.08
i'm sort of an exception case

1050.84 --> 1057.52
though i'd like to blame my indonesian

1054.08 --> 1061.4399999999998
blood whatever is left of it

1057.52 --> 1062.8799999999999
that's even how my parents kind of like

1061.44 --> 1065.28
called it

1062.88 --> 1068.0
would you say like that's

1065.28 --> 1070.08
indonesian people are like super nice

1068.0 --> 1072.24
and super calm like all of them all of

1070.08 --> 1074.3999999999999
them that i've ever met were super nice

1072.24 --> 1076.96
super calm kind of wise

1074.4 --> 1078.88
but if they got pissed off especially if

1076.96 --> 1081.8400000000001
it's like

1078.88 --> 1081.8400000000001
about their

1081.919 --> 1086.96
like about their spouse or something or

1084.08 --> 1088.6399999999999
about their their livelihood if they get

1086.96 --> 1090.32
really pissed off they're they're

1088.64 --> 1091.6000000000001
[ __ ] dangerous

1090.32 --> 1093.52
or

1091.6 --> 1095.36
allegedly i've never seen it happen

1093.52 --> 1097.2
really

1095.36 --> 1099.4399999999998
with others like i've never seen an

1097.2 --> 1102.24
indonesian lose control like that but

1099.44 --> 1104.0
apparently it sort of is a thing

1102.24 --> 1105.679
and i think i might have had a little

1104.0 --> 1109.919
bit of a

1105.679 --> 1111.76
swoop of that genetically a little bit

1109.919 --> 1113.76
and that's where the rage wind kind of

1111.76 --> 1117.28
now is born onto

1113.76 --> 1118.24
but i use it also to bypass

1117.28 --> 1120.96
the

1118.24 --> 1125.039
being wrong about everything frequency

1120.96 --> 1125.039
that's what i originally used it for

1127.28 --> 1131.6789999999999
because if you're just wrong

1129.44 --> 1133.679
and you're not pissed off about it you

1131.679 --> 1136.64
might take on the

1133.679 --> 1139.679
receiving position you see they like

1136.64 --> 1142.3200000000002
okay i was wrong i'll take criticism the

1139.679 --> 1143.919
flow stops whatever you were doing you

1142.32 --> 1145.52
can't build up more energy you have to

1143.919 --> 1147.679
wait to receive

1145.52 --> 1149.679
but then

1147.679 --> 1151.2800000000002
most people don't even realize

1149.679 --> 1154.4
subconsciously how to deal with that and

1151.28 --> 1156.6399999999999
then they start piling on you

1154.4 --> 1157.52
or they just break it off and then

1156.64 --> 1159.2800000000002
you're

1157.52 --> 1161.6
left

1159.28 --> 1164.8799999999999
with just being wrong

1161.6 --> 1168.6399999999999
and it's sucks

1164.88 --> 1170.88
but if you can like kind of like

1168.64 --> 1173.76
you could i see norman benjamin does

1170.88 --> 1176.96
this too in his own way it's fascinating

1173.76 --> 1179.039
i might have actually learned a bit of

1176.96 --> 1181.039
how to do it from him

1179.039 --> 1184.0
like to improve my skill at it because

1181.039 --> 1188.72
i've been raging like a freak

1184.0 --> 1188.72
like longer than i've even known him so

1190.48 --> 1193.72
but uh

1193.76 --> 1198.08
instead of just getting stuck in a

1195.6 --> 1200.0
receiving position

1198.08 --> 1202.1589999999999
when you're wrong

1200.0 --> 1204.559
and then breaking the flow you can

1202.159 --> 1206.3200000000002
simply

1204.559 --> 1208.72
dominate

1206.32 --> 1211.36
and then you are wrong

1208.72 --> 1214.64
but the other will not be

1211.36 --> 1215.84
feeling free to take over dominate and

1214.64 --> 1218.72
then

1215.84 --> 1222.3999999999999
like stop your flow

1218.72 --> 1224.799
right and if some people then are like

1222.4 --> 1225.919
really insist they actually came up to

1224.799 --> 1228.559
you

1225.919 --> 1230.7990000000002
to do that specifically to find a moment

1228.559 --> 1232.3999999999999
where you will be wrong and people are

1230.799 --> 1235.36
wrong very

1232.4 --> 1237.8400000000001
very regularly even the most smart ones

1235.36 --> 1240.24
like the more smart things you say the

1237.84 --> 1242.559
more likely it is that egregious errors

1240.24 --> 1245.039
will even pop up in there it's like

1242.559 --> 1246.799
natural that that happens and troll

1245.039 --> 1248.72
types

1246.799 --> 1251.28
seek out those moments and they use that

1248.72 --> 1255.44
to to break your momentum to try to

1251.28 --> 1255.44
swipe you off your feet in the moment

1255.84 --> 1259.4399999999998
but you could do something about that

1260.559 --> 1266.0
instead of becoming the receiver

1263.76 --> 1267.679
because you were wrong and you have to

1266.0 --> 1269.6
admit you're wrong right if you just

1267.679 --> 1271.76
ignore being wrong you get into all

1269.6 --> 1273.6
sorts of weird

1271.76 --> 1275.28
reality splitting

1273.6 --> 1277.84
consequences because you're going to

1275.28 --> 1279.52
start double thinking that's even worse

1277.84 --> 1281.36
so you should always confront it when

1279.52 --> 1284.08
you're wrong but don't become on the

1281.36 --> 1287.36
receiving end necessarily if you're in

1284.08 --> 1290.36
the middle of doing something instead

1287.36 --> 1290.36
dominate

1291.44 --> 1295.76
give recognition to the importance of

1294.08 --> 1298.32
what you're doing and the energy of it

1295.76 --> 1300.24
and that it needs to be continued

1298.32 --> 1302.32
and if somebody specifically is

1300.24 --> 1304.48
attacking you and trying to top you with

1302.32 --> 1306.0
that momentum that you're having

1304.48 --> 1306.799
dominate

1306.0 --> 1307.76
and

1306.799 --> 1310.6399999999999
well

1307.76 --> 1312.4
you got anger

1310.64 --> 1314.64
that's the moment to use it and that's

1312.4 --> 1316.4
what i try to do

1314.64 --> 1319.039
unfortunately

1316.4 --> 1321.1200000000001
the switching up back and forth between

1319.039 --> 1323.679
being calm and suddenly being angry can

1321.12 --> 1325.6789999999999
be very quick with me and that can be

1323.679 --> 1327.3600000000001
like a bit shocking that's the problem

1325.679 --> 1329.76
is that i've almost become like too

1327.36 --> 1330.84
quick with it

1329.76 --> 1334.1589999999999
but the

1330.84 --> 1336.1589999999999
quickness with which i do it

1334.159 --> 1338.7990000000002
is because it's just become much more

1336.159 --> 1340.24
energy efficient to me i don't

1338.799 --> 1342.72
become like

1340.24 --> 1345.039
oh my god i'm so drained

1342.72 --> 1347.52
afterward right if anybody's ever

1345.039 --> 1349.76
experienced like moments of real big

1347.52 --> 1352.32
rage that you're like so pissed off and

1349.76 --> 1354.48
you like gotta bash something or you got

1352.32 --> 1355.76
into a fight that just wouldn't stop

1354.48 --> 1358.48
verbal fight

1355.76 --> 1360.48
say with spouse terrible

1358.48 --> 1361.6
super draining

1360.48 --> 1364.799
well

1361.6 --> 1366.1589999999999
i can get really insidious

1364.799 --> 1368.24
without

1366.159 --> 1370.24
it draining me

1368.24 --> 1371.44
anymore

1370.24 --> 1374.48
unless

1371.44 --> 1377.3600000000001
while within the rage i fail

1374.48 --> 1378.72
and that can still happen i can still be

1377.36 --> 1382.3999999999999
in the rage

1378.72 --> 1384.72
and then face a mistake that i just

1382.4 --> 1388.4
that completely flips the rager it's

1384.72 --> 1390.48
super tricky and trolls know this a lot

1388.4 --> 1392.0800000000002
of the times onlookers don't really

1390.48 --> 1394.24
understand what's going on anymore at

1392.08 --> 1396.559
that level because it is becoming like a

1394.24 --> 1399.039
spiritual battle that's almost surreal

1396.559 --> 1400.84
sounds weird right it's just trolls well

1399.039 --> 1405.039
guess what just

1400.84 --> 1406.8799999999999
trolls unfortunately set all their

1405.039 --> 1409.84
power

1406.88 --> 1412.72
on the interaction on the high level and

1409.84 --> 1414.559
they waste all the rest of their time

1412.72 --> 1417.2
so they focus all their power on

1414.559 --> 1420.32
something that's completely pointless

1417.2 --> 1423.2
from their perspective really

1420.32 --> 1426.24
just to feel more powerful than somebody

1423.2 --> 1427.2
you're sparring with that's all it is

1426.24 --> 1430.48
but

1427.2 --> 1432.64
don't underestimate their skill

1430.48 --> 1434.88
because they often do

1432.64 --> 1437.76
like hounds

1434.88 --> 1440.64
seeking a prey they they just figure

1437.76 --> 1442.799
their target out on a higher level even

1440.64 --> 1445.76
though in their normal life they have

1442.799 --> 1447.84
absolutely no skills it's because of the

1445.76 --> 1450.72
obsession

1447.84 --> 1452.3999999999999
that they can still grasp it

1450.72 --> 1456.96
farther does it mean that they

1452.4 --> 1459.3600000000001
understand mechanical logic and lore

1456.96 --> 1462.0
knowledge right that's not what it's

1459.36 --> 1464.1589999999999
about no they but they get

1462.0 --> 1467.36
the sensitive workings and the

1464.159 --> 1469.44
subtleties of a person they do get that

1467.36 --> 1471.12
and you got to be very careful not to

1469.44 --> 1474.88
underestimate

1471.12 --> 1474.8799999999999
how sharp they get with that

1477.2 --> 1479.8400000000001
right

1478.32 --> 1482.0
so yeah everything i'm talking about

1479.84 --> 1484.6399999999999
doesn't really apply to farmers and

1482.0 --> 1488.0
politicians

1484.64 --> 1490.24
but maybe in a way indirectly it does

1488.0 --> 1491.84
maybe there is a fractal connection

1490.24 --> 1493.919
right i've already laid down the

1491.84 --> 1496.8799999999999
comparison of

1493.919 --> 1499.44
flat earthers online and global

1496.88 --> 1502.48
anti-flat earther trolls with

1499.44 --> 1504.96
well politicians and the public and hey

1502.48 --> 1507.279
the farmers are basically

1504.96 --> 1510.64
a part of that as well

1507.279 --> 1514.159
you could almost say that farmers

1510.64 --> 1516.7990000000002
metaphorically not saying that i am one

1514.159 --> 1519.1200000000001
that the farmers would be like the flat

1516.799 --> 1521.039
earthers

1519.12 --> 1523.6789999999999
where the politicians would be like the

1521.039 --> 1526.24
anti-flat earthers

1523.679 --> 1528.3200000000002
and then probably the things that those

1526.24 --> 1530.24
parties are all dealing with and how

1528.32 --> 1533.9189999999999
they intercommunicate

1530.24 --> 1536.799
probably gonna seem extremely similar

1533.919 --> 1538.7990000000002
if you've actually studied

1536.799 --> 1543.039
the flat earth scene for a while flat

1538.799 --> 1544.799
earth debates and me and

1543.039 --> 1546.48
everything that's been going on around

1544.799 --> 1548.32
us

1546.48 --> 1550.88
and then compare it to whatever you've

1548.32 --> 1552.8799999999999
been studying or whatever

1550.88 --> 1554.88
country you've been studying with their

1552.88 --> 1556.64
politicians

1554.88 --> 1559.1200000000001
and

1556.64 --> 1560.24
the counterpowers of the public

1559.12 --> 1564.2399999999998
and

1560.24 --> 1565.76
farmers or yeah some very national local

1564.24 --> 1568.159
industry

1565.76 --> 1570.559
figures right

1568.159 --> 1573.3600000000001
the similarities as to how the what

1570.559 --> 1576.96
frequencies they're operating on

1573.36 --> 1578.799
the high level they attain within their

1576.96 --> 1581.039
unique position

1578.799 --> 1583.6
for the the root side

1581.039 --> 1587.12
and just the maniacal

1583.6 --> 1591.1999999999998
dementia on the other side

1587.12 --> 1591.1999999999998
it's going to be extremely similar

1591.279 --> 1593.52
like

1593.6 --> 1597.4399999999998
i have an interesting idea probably

1595.6 --> 1599.1999999999998
never execute anything like that there

1597.44 --> 1600.48
might be other people that might do it

1599.2 --> 1604.32
at some point

1600.48 --> 1607.6
so just compare footage

1604.32 --> 1610.24
or compare conversations right

1607.6 --> 1612.24
like some flat earth versus anti-flat

1610.24 --> 1615.279
earther conversation

1612.24 --> 1617.6
and then take a piece from like a poly

1615.279 --> 1621.279
political discussion on the political

1617.6 --> 1623.4399999999998
floor like on tv or something right

1621.279 --> 1626.159
or c's fan

1623.44 --> 1628.72
just put it next to one another just to

1626.159 --> 1631.5200000000002
see like what is this pattern unrolling

1628.72 --> 1634.4
do you recognize these traits

1631.52 --> 1636.32
you'll find out that it really is very

1634.4 --> 1637.8400000000001
similar i've been saying this for a

1636.32 --> 1640.6399999999999
while but

1637.84 --> 1645.12
it's gonna be even more pronounced

1640.64 --> 1645.1200000000001
as time passes that is my prediction

1649.2 --> 1654.6000000000001
right

1650.159 --> 1654.6000000000001
so i hope you enjoyed that

1654.88 --> 1660.3200000000002
a little train of thought

1657.84 --> 1665.1589999999999
and my reflections

1660.32 --> 1665.1589999999999
i was really inspired today

1679.679 --> 1683.039
right also today i had a little bump in

1681.679 --> 1684.5590000000002
on

1683.039 --> 1686.24
in the

1684.559 --> 1688.559
at the store

1686.24 --> 1690.96
or some guy that's always

1688.559 --> 1694.0
he's like caught up in sjw [ __ ] he's

1690.96 --> 1694.8400000000001
like half a [ __ ] and he's not all

1694.0 --> 1697.2
that

1694.84 --> 1699.52
smart so he's really like a tragic

1697.2 --> 1702.0800000000002
figure but he's always like on the wrong

1699.52 --> 1704.0
side he always falls for propaganda [ __ ]

1702.08 --> 1706.0
and then starts to blabber to people

1704.0 --> 1708.159
about it

1706.0 --> 1709.679
because he's really lonely it is just

1708.159 --> 1711.5200000000002
tragic but

1709.679 --> 1713.44
sometimes i just have to correct him and

1711.52 --> 1717.9189999999999
today he was like shooting all the

1713.44 --> 1720.0
wealthy foreign like dude

1717.919 --> 1721.679
you literally have no idea what the [ __ ]

1720.0 --> 1723.6
you're saying

1721.679 --> 1726.48
so i laid it all out and while other

1723.6 --> 1728.399
people were also listening and

1726.48 --> 1730.159
they actually complimented me afterwards

1728.399 --> 1732.6399999999999
so that was pretty awesome

1730.159 --> 1733.8400000000001
it's good to hear that people are are

1732.64 --> 1735.3600000000001
getting it

1733.84 --> 1738.9599999999998
or they're at least they're getting it

1735.36 --> 1742.1589999999999
when they're hearing it right

1738.96 --> 1744.32
that was also very uh

1742.159 --> 1745.8400000000001
comforting

1744.32 --> 1749.039
and there was an american there i had to

1745.84 --> 1752.4399999999998
translate it into english

1749.039 --> 1752.44
and i could

1754.399 --> 1757.399
right

1767.919 --> 1776.159
oh yeah i forgot youtube yeah roxanne

1771.44 --> 1776.159
was live i but i completely missed it

1779.12 --> 1783.799
there's a lot of streams yesterday that

1780.64 --> 1783.7990000000002
i missed

1797.919 --> 1803.279
yeah mostly just been watching like owen

1800.48 --> 1803.279
benjamin and

1807.039 --> 1810.48
because i watch owen benjamin like in

1809.36 --> 1812.4799999999998
waves

1810.48 --> 1814.559
i can't just

1812.48 --> 1817.6
like sometimes i just there's a day that

1814.559 --> 1819.6
i'm like yeah i i don't want to watch

1817.6 --> 1822.559
him today

1819.6 --> 1826.6
but i'll catch up and then i do like the

1822.559 --> 1826.6
next day or two days after

1836.24 --> 1840.3990000000001
it's also because it's just kind of

1838.08 --> 1840.399
weird

1841.52 --> 1845.44
so just the synchronicities oh man by

1844.24 --> 1847.6
the way like the amount of

1845.44 --> 1849.2
synchronicities in that stream that i

1847.6 --> 1850.799
mentioned when he mentioned the farmers

1849.2 --> 1854.0
in the netherlands

1850.799 --> 1855.039
was just insane

1854.0 --> 1857.44
like

1855.039 --> 1860.48
i wonder sometimes if he's secretly kind

1857.44 --> 1862.96
of being trixie after all

1860.48 --> 1864.799
like it's this one gravel thing that he

1862.96 --> 1867.2
could do it doesn't really matter but he

1864.799 --> 1868.48
just really wants to do but it's just

1867.2 --> 1871.2
because

1868.48 --> 1874.08
if all of that is like a hundred percent

1871.2 --> 1876.24
completely natural that is just

1874.08 --> 1878.08
completely bonkers the amounts of

1876.24 --> 1881.679
synchronicities

1878.08 --> 1883.76
that would be just completely bonkers

1881.679 --> 1886.3990000000001
so i wonder if there's like a little

1883.76 --> 1890.32
little sneaky thingy

1886.399 --> 1890.32
screw bardic screwing around

1891.2 --> 1896.3990000000001
but it's still just great doesn't really

1893.44 --> 1897.1200000000001
matter in the end

1896.399 --> 1898.1999999999998
just

1897.12 --> 1899.9189999999999
i don't know

1898.2 --> 1902.0
[Music]

1899.919 --> 1903.919
just i don't

1902.0 --> 1906.399
it's like unbelievable

1903.919 --> 1908.159
people don't have that many

1906.399 --> 1910.0
synchronicities it's just i'm becoming

1908.159 --> 1912.0
an unbeliever nobody has that many

1910.0 --> 1914.32
synchronicities it's just

1912.0 --> 1915.519
crazy

1914.32 --> 1918.0
like

1915.519 --> 1920.72
maybe one time right

1918.0 --> 1922.64
but not the freaking all the time like i

1920.72 --> 1925.84
had it that one time

1922.64 --> 1927.279
like i never forget that moment never

1925.84 --> 1929.1999999999998
it's the day

1927.279 --> 1930.559
or the the week

1929.2 --> 1932.32
it was a month

1930.559 --> 1934.0
a while ago

1932.32 --> 1936.08
before the flat earth early bird show

1934.0 --> 1938.88
when i

1936.08 --> 1940.32
went working at a call center

1938.88 --> 1943.2
and then like

1940.32 --> 1945.6
when i got back turned on alex jones the

1943.2 --> 1949.279
entire freaking show

1945.6 --> 1951.519
was call center themed

1949.279 --> 1951.519
like

1954.08 --> 1956.399
what the [ __ ]

1955.17 --> 1957.44
[Music]

1956.399 --> 1960.2399999999998
right

1957.44 --> 1962.64
never forget that i was so freaky

1960.24 --> 1964.559
when like i was really scared when that

1962.64 --> 1965.76
happened it was like what the [ __ ] is

1964.559 --> 1969.12
this

1965.76 --> 1972.399
are you spying on me

1969.12 --> 1972.399
why did you do that

1974.88 --> 1980.5590000000002
that was really freaky

1978.159 --> 1983.7600000000002
but yeah that that thank god doesn't

1980.559 --> 1983.76
happen to me all the time

1986.72 --> 1988.96
ah

1989.2 --> 1993.96
yes you can start water thank you for

1990.96 --> 1993.96
that

2004.559 --> 2011.399
this was two years oh what what

2007.919 --> 2011.3990000000001
oh okay

2024.48 --> 2028.159
hey jeddah good to see you

2029.279 --> 2032.24
hey gaining wisdom

2030.84 --> 2035.8799999999999
also almost

2032.24 --> 2035.88
didn't see you there

2059.76 --> 2064.079
goes out in about speaker's corner well

2062.159 --> 2066.2400000000002
usually youtube

2064.079 --> 2068.32
unless she's like really busy because

2066.24 --> 2069.7599999999998
she is also a mother

2068.32 --> 2072.8790000000004
gotta realize that and they're like

2069.76 --> 2072.8790000000004
teens and all that so

2073.52 --> 2076.079
you missed

2077.919 --> 2079.919
b

2078.639 --> 2082.0
hitting

2079.919 --> 2084.6389999999997
the big time

2082.0 --> 2086.48
too bad what

2084.639 --> 2087.44
two ads to get on

2086.48 --> 2089.919
i

2087.44 --> 2093.52
so jedo i do

2089.919 --> 2097.1189999999997
yeah the ads are not avoiding me

2093.52 --> 2098.48
anymore that used to happen by the way

2097.119 --> 2102.079
right like

2098.48 --> 2105.04
early bird at the start

2102.079 --> 2106.88
it it didn't

2105.04 --> 2109.839
like sometimes it would just be no ads

2106.88 --> 2111.04
now every time every show it always has

2109.839 --> 2113.04
ads

2111.04 --> 2115.2799999999997
and some shows are like completely

2113.04 --> 2117.839
riddled with it and like what

2115.28 --> 2117.8390000000004
okay

2121.8 --> 2127.44
synchronicities increase as your

2123.76 --> 2127.44
spiritual growth progresses

2127.52 --> 2130.7599999999998
i guess

2134.4 --> 2139.76
it's just i don't wanna

2136.4 --> 2141.52
if that is literally true rig back

2139.76 --> 2143.0400000000004
then i just don't want to grow too

2141.52 --> 2145.359
quickly

2143.04 --> 2148.64
because like heavy synchronicities are

2145.359 --> 2150.7999999999997
really scary i like they scare me it's

2148.64 --> 2153.1189999999997
just it feels

2150.8 --> 2155.04
like reality is warping or something

2153.119 --> 2156.96
it's really freaky

2155.04 --> 2159.2799999999997
when it's that strong

2156.96 --> 2160.88
i mean little synchronicities when when

2159.28 --> 2162.96
you just get it like oh yeah

2160.88 --> 2164.96
everything's connected see oh it's like

2162.96 --> 2167.119
oh it just shows you la yeah we're

2164.96 --> 2167.92
listening that's kind of subtle that's

2167.119 --> 2169.92
like

2167.92 --> 2173.119
yeah you can get all obsessed over it if

2169.92 --> 2174.96
you insist but it's just kind of a

2173.119 --> 2176.2400000000002
reminder like yeah there's just this

2174.96 --> 2178.48
structure and

2176.24 --> 2180.7999999999997
like it's all kind of alive right that's

2178.48 --> 2183.359
not a terrible sensation

2180.8 --> 2186.4
but when like really big things start to

2183.359 --> 2188.4
suddenly synchronize that's [ __ ]

2186.4 --> 2190.1600000000003
scary

2188.4 --> 2192.2400000000002
to me

2190.16 --> 2193.1189999999997
or it was with that one experience at

2192.24 --> 2194.8799999999997
least

2193.119 --> 2196.96
because it's just like something that i

2194.88 --> 2199.04
saw is like this is a really big

2196.96 --> 2203.599
platform

2199.04 --> 2205.52
alex jones it was really intense also

2203.599 --> 2206.96
in that time they were still like doing

2205.52 --> 2209.44
really good

2206.96 --> 2209.44
and then

2209.599 --> 2213.6800000000003
just like what the [ __ ]

2211.839 --> 2215.7599999999998
like they've never done anything like

2213.68 --> 2218.56
that why would they do that there wasn't

2215.76 --> 2221.8390000000004
even anything in the news

2218.56 --> 2224.96
that would even suggest call centers or

2221.839 --> 2226.64
something being a thing like it was just

2224.96 --> 2228.96
out of nowhere

2226.64 --> 2230.7999999999997
like the day

2228.96 --> 2231.92
that i started working

2230.8 --> 2235.119
came back

2231.92 --> 2236.7200000000003
watching alex jones and like oh hi

2235.119 --> 2238.4
and they were like all talking like they

2236.72 --> 2242.1189999999997
were in a call center and like what the

2238.4 --> 2242.119
[ __ ] is this

2242.16 --> 2246.96
like that scared the [ __ ] out of me man

2244.8 --> 2249.2000000000003
that was like too much like what the

2246.96 --> 2249.2
[ __ ]

2252.8 --> 2257.28
can you imagine that

2254.72 --> 2258.72
how crazy that feels when you experience

2257.28 --> 2261.28
something that

2258.72 --> 2261.2799999999997
intense

2263.92 --> 2267.16
come on

2275.47 --> 2280.8799999999997
[Music]

2277.76 --> 2283.2000000000003
it yeah it gives you a very serious uh

2280.88 --> 2284.4
truman show feeling that that's what it

2283.2 --> 2288.16
really did

2284.4 --> 2288.1600000000003
it was like what the [ __ ] man

2288.8 --> 2293.8390000000004
like are you spy it's just like are you

2291.119 --> 2296.88
spying on me

2293.839 --> 2300.88
like thing that i like to watch are you

2296.88 --> 2300.88
spying on it's really freaky

2305.28 --> 2308.1600000000003
but anyway

2308.64 --> 2313.92
synchronicities yeah they do happen in

2312.16 --> 2316.0
times of spiritual growth and i guess

2313.92 --> 2319.44
that that moment back then to me was a

2316.0 --> 2322.24
pretty big step also

2319.44 --> 2322.2400000000002
when i did that

2322.96 --> 2327.92
so i probably was in very strong

2325.52 --> 2331.92
spiritual growth i did feel it it's just

2327.92 --> 2334.32
when it happens to that level it's scary

2331.92 --> 2337.44
like and it did almost like break my

2334.32 --> 2340.88
momentum it did topple me in a bit

2337.44 --> 2342.88
so it wasn't really that great

2340.88 --> 2344.4
it disrupted me the level of

2342.88 --> 2347.04
synchronicity

2344.4 --> 2347.04
in my face

2374.48 --> 2379.48
what what are you talking about

2376.48 --> 2379.48
lithuania

2395.52 --> 2400.079
yeah

2396.4 --> 2402.4
yeah i remember that seeking star wars

2400.079 --> 2404.8
i got that photo like on one of my title

2402.4 --> 2408.599
cards

2404.8 --> 2408.599
from like last year

2413.28 --> 2417.6800000000003
yeah a globe lighter it was pretty

2415.44 --> 2419.44
amazing i almost was gonna go on it it

2417.68 --> 2424.44
was just i was

2456.16 --> 2459.5989999999997

yeah

2675.04 --> 2677.839
okay

2680.64 --> 2684.72
i think everybody's

2682.56 --> 2687.2
best globe earth proof is that they

2684.72 --> 2687.2
think that

2689.28 --> 2693.0400000000004
everybody thinks it's a globe

2692.079 --> 2695.3590000000004
or

2693.04 --> 2698.96
mostly and

2695.359 --> 2698.96
so much work has been spent

2699.44 --> 2703.04
on

2700.4 --> 2705.52
portraying it like a globe so

2703.04 --> 2707.2
why wouldn't it be a globe

2705.52 --> 2708.96
i think that's the

2707.2 --> 2713.24
universal best

2708.96 --> 2713.2400000000002
globe earth proof for people

2724.72 --> 2727.72
um

2742.079 --> 2746.7200000000003
yeah borders boy

2744.0 --> 2751.4

hey ben white good to see you

2783.64 --> 2786.83
[Music]

2800.16 --> 2804.72
you know what the quickest best answer

2802.0 --> 2807.04
to that is ben white that trope why

2804.72 --> 2808.48
would they lie

2807.04 --> 2812.119
because there's a lot of people that

2808.48 --> 2812.119
want to hear the lie

2817.92 --> 2824.8
that is the most universal best answer

2821.04 --> 2826.96
to when somebody asks that question

2824.8 --> 2828.6400000000003
that explains a lot

2826.96 --> 2831.28
both about psychology and about

2828.64 --> 2834.0
motivation

2831.28 --> 2834.0
for doing it

2835.04 --> 2839.119
because people will do it because other

2837.599 --> 2842.1600000000003
people want to hear it and they don't

2839.119 --> 2845.8
even know whether it is a lie or not

2842.16 --> 2845.7999999999997
right that's the point

2882.72 --> 2887.839
right well they lie because knowledge is

2884.559 --> 2887.8390000000004
power that's also a good one

2888.88 --> 2891.6800000000003
but that

2890.27 --> 2893.04
[Music]

2891.68 --> 2897.04
will not

2893.04 --> 2899.04
light up as many lights in their heads

2897.04 --> 2902.319
when they say it

2899.04 --> 2902.319
okay repeat that okay

2903.119 --> 2906.6400000000003
so when somebody asked why would they

2904.88 --> 2908.7200000000003
lie

2906.64 --> 2911.2799999999997
you say

2908.72 --> 2914.839
well because a lot of people want to

2911.28 --> 2914.8390000000004
hear that lie

2917.2 --> 2921.04
right

2918.72 --> 2923.52
and you can elaborate on that

2921.04 --> 2926.079
because you don't even have to know it's

2923.52 --> 2927.52
a lie to do it then

2926.079 --> 2929.599
if you just

2927.52 --> 2931.599
know people want to hear this story you

2929.599 --> 2934.2400000000002
might even believe the story and you're

2931.599 --> 2937.28
just telling it because

2934.24 --> 2937.2799999999997
people want to hear it

2939.359 --> 2944.72
that's the reason why most people repeat

2942.24 --> 2947.1189999999997
this nonsense

2944.72 --> 2950.3999999999996
they didn't figure it out they're just

2947.119 --> 2953.76
saying what they they're just talking

2950.4 --> 2953.76
with a popular story

2953.92 --> 2959.76
that they think will make people in awe

2957.359 --> 2959.7599999999998
with them

2966.24 --> 2971.7999999999997
right

2967.04 --> 2971.8
they don't even have to know it's a lie

2973.599 --> 2977.599
right it's about the motive for telling

2975.76 --> 2979.76
the story that's

2977.599 --> 2983.2000000000003
why they do it that's why people do it

2979.76 --> 2985.28
because it's popular basically that's

2983.2 --> 2986.8799999999997
why do they lie because it's popular

2985.28 --> 2989.8390000000004
that's really what it comes down to but

2986.88 --> 2989.839
if you just say that

2990.4 --> 2995.359
that won't make as many lights go off in

2992.96 --> 2995.359
their head

2996.319 --> 3000.4
if you say it in the way that i said it

2998.319 --> 3002.4
they lie because there's a lot of people

3000.4 --> 3003.359
that want to hear the lie

3002.4 --> 3005.76
that

3003.359 --> 3007.2
lights up a lot more different

3005.76 --> 3010.3190000000004
directions

3007.2 --> 3015.16
of realization in your head

3010.319 --> 3015.16
because of the before mentioned reasons

by the way weird question from me there

3174.4 --> 3177.28
akuma virus

3177.839 --> 3183.44
why would they be dumb enough to lie

3180.72 --> 3185.68
about the shape of the earth it's a dumb

3183.44 --> 3185.68
lie

3186.72 --> 3190.5589999999997
uh

3187.76 --> 3194.6400000000003
what do you mean dumb enough

3190.559 --> 3198.3190000000004
it's worked out great hasn't it

3194.64 --> 3198.319
the lie is widely believed

3200.88 --> 3205.44
it's not a dumb it's a very

3202.64 --> 3209.839
sophisticated lie the globe religion is

3205.44 --> 3209.839
a very sophisticated lie

3209.92 --> 3217.28
and you gotta have some level of smarts

3213.52 --> 3219.44
even to be able to figure it out

3217.28 --> 3223.7200000000003
let alone like all the peer pressure

3219.44 --> 3223.7200000000003
effects that's around it

3287.92 --> 3295.92
what what do you mean rig bag

3291.76 --> 3300.76
what do you mean symbiotic relationship

3295.92 --> 3300.76
seems pretty damn parasitic to me

3320.88 --> 3326.0
i mean where does the symbiosis come in

3323.04 --> 3326.0
really rig back

3326.88 --> 3330.6800000000003
can you lay that down

3334.88 --> 3339.76
yeah i thought so

3337.68 --> 3341.2
i mean i wish it was a symbiotic

3339.76 --> 3344.7990000000004
relationship

3341.2 --> 3348.2
it just doesn't really seem to be

3344.799 --> 3348.2
meant to be

3354.079 --> 3357.599
although

3355.44 --> 3361.119
look i do get

3357.599 --> 3361.119
that's not really worth it

3361.52 --> 3366.319
i mean it would be symbiotic the moment

3363.92 --> 3368.559
where anti-flat earthers are actually

3366.319 --> 3371.04
just gonna regularly sponsor flat

3368.559 --> 3374.0400000000004
earthers

3371.04 --> 3374.04
right

3376.0 --> 3381.119
that's

3376.88 --> 3381.119
when it would become symbiotic

3385.52 --> 3388.48
but they don't really do that

3387.52 --> 3391.52
some

3388.48 --> 3393.839
of them do that i mean like phil bell

3391.52 --> 3395.04
is giving me a couple of bucks here and

3393.839 --> 3397.7599999999998
there and

3395.04 --> 3399.52
other ballers too in occasion

3397.76 --> 3401.92
but

3399.52 --> 3401.92
it's just

3402.319 --> 3407.119
not any solid support right if they

3405.359 --> 3409.52
would be like yeah yeah yeah we need

3407.119 --> 3411.6800000000003
flat earthers because

3409.52 --> 3413.92
that makes what we do worth it or

3411.68 --> 3416.48
something right it gives us somebody to

3413.92 --> 3416.48
point at

3416.559 --> 3420.88
well then it would be a symbiotic

3418.96 --> 3425.119
relationship but they don't really do

3420.88 --> 3425.119
that they really bully us

3425.839 --> 3430.799
and

3427.76 --> 3433.5200000000004
get all political on our asses

3430.799 --> 3436.4
to really try to discourage us and make

3433.52 --> 3437.7599999999998
us stop somehow it's not working

3436.4 --> 3439.92
not really

3437.76 --> 3443.0400000000004
it works to some that don't really want

3439.92 --> 3444.799
to go the full effort

3443.04 --> 3446.799
to go through all that

3444.799 --> 3450.16
that's yeah but there's nothing

3446.799 --> 3453.16
symbiotic about what they do to us

3450.16 --> 3453.16
unfortunately

3461.92 --> 3467.119
right i would like for example akumu

3464.079 --> 3469.8390000000004
virus here who is an anti-flat earther

3467.119 --> 3472.079
he's not really parasitic

3469.839 --> 3475.839
but he's not symbiotic either he's just

3472.079 --> 3475.8390000000004
like kind of like neutral

3477.92 --> 3482.48
and that's fine

3480.24 --> 3484.5589999999997
in a way i like that that we can still

3482.48 --> 3487.68
be together

3484.559 --> 3489.6800000000003
hanging around and not just always focus

3487.68 --> 3491.68
focused on the

3489.68 --> 3493.9199999999996
philosophical opponent

3491.68 --> 3493.9199999999996
right

3498.0 --> 3503.839
right but it's not symbiotic either

3501.52 --> 3506.799
it's just neutral

3503.839 --> 3506.799
in this case

3507.68 --> 3514.319
so yeah we can neutralize

3511.359 --> 3515.2
the situation between anti-flat earthers

3514.319 --> 3516.48
and us

3515.2 --> 3518.0
at best

3516.48 --> 3520.16
it's never going to turn into a

3518.0 --> 3523.359
symbiosis i don't see it happening it's

3520.16 --> 3526.0
it it wouldn't mechanically be able to

3523.359 --> 3528.799
within what they do it's just they're

3526.0 --> 3530.64
not compatible they're fundamentally

3528.799 --> 3532.559
incompatible

3530.64 --> 3533.92
it's never going to be a symbiosis but

3532.559 --> 3536.4
it could be

3533.92 --> 3536.4
neutral

3538.4 --> 3542.4
they could like learn to

3540.64 --> 3544.799
halfway figure out what the hell is

3542.4 --> 3545.839
going on and not be a freaking parasite

3544.799 --> 3548.799
to us

3545.839 --> 3548.799
and the rest of the world

3549.29 --> 3554.0
[Music]

3550.88 --> 3556.88
at least is a partial win

3554.0 --> 3559.599
on that front right i mean besides the

3556.88 --> 3563.2000000000003
philosophical absolute devastating

3559.599 --> 3565.599
victory that we've had for a long time

3563.2 --> 3566.64
but yeah we still have to resolve the

3565.599 --> 3568.6400000000003
social

3566.64 --> 3572.4
situation

3568.64 --> 3575.4
between us all

3572.4 --> 3575.4
hmm

3590.0 --> 3593.359
it's a symbiote to me

3594.799 --> 3599.319
i would talking about government again

3601.359 --> 3607.52
yeah if only a kumu virus i know that's

3603.76 --> 3607.5200000000004
how you like to think of it isn't it

3608.0 --> 3612.16
people in the government help you

3610.079 --> 3614.559
people pay taxes

3612.16 --> 3616.24
yeah unfortunately those are not really

3614.559 --> 3618.079
as connected as you would like them to

3616.24 --> 3622.3999999999996
be

3618.079 --> 3622.4
jesus magpie baby shut up

3624.48 --> 3627.44
get your own drink

3627.52 --> 3632.079
seriously that

3629.68 --> 3633.359
he was just sitting there at the water

3632.079 --> 3635.04
bowl

3633.359 --> 3636.319
not drinking

3635.04 --> 3639.359
like

3636.319 --> 3641.359
daddy feed me this water like

3639.359 --> 3644.0789999999997
you put your freaking head at it and you

3641.359 --> 3646.88
drink it yourself you damn

3644.079 --> 3647.92
lazy ass

3646.88 --> 3650.559
noise

3647.92 --> 3653.559
oh my god it's just never leaving him

3650.559 --> 3653.559
alone

3667.04 --> 3670.48
yeah

3668.079 --> 3674.079
now unfortunately it's not really a

3670.48 --> 3674.079
symbiosis akuma virus

3674.88 --> 3680.079
right because the way you get help from

3677.599 --> 3680.079
government

3680.96 --> 3687.04
they make you dependent on their help

3684.96 --> 3689.839
right you start to maneuver your life in

3687.04 --> 3692.0
a way where you just become dependent on

3689.839 --> 3696.24
them

3692.0 --> 3696.24
right people pay taxes but yeah

3696.4 --> 3701.52
a lot of the time those taxes

3699.359 --> 3704.0
don't even end up

3701.52 --> 3706.4
back in the same system

3704.0 --> 3708.64
it's all rigged all the tax

3706.4 --> 3710.48
collection systems and all that it's

3708.64 --> 3712.48
rigged in a lot of places it is here in

3710.48 --> 3716.079
the netherlands it's just i don't even

3712.48 --> 3716.079
know how it works anymore it's just

3722.64 --> 3724.8799999999997
but

3724.96 --> 3731.28
it might seem symbiotic but

3727.599 --> 3734.799
yeah i mean a fly trap you know seems

3731.28 --> 3736.7200000000003
very symbiotic to a fly

3734.799 --> 3739.119
when they approach it seems very

3736.72 --> 3740.48
symbiotic oh it's just

3739.119 --> 3742.48
i mean

3740.48 --> 3746.839
race sugary stuff

3742.48 --> 3746.839
what what could be wrong about that

3768.079 --> 3771.799
okay right big

3792.319 --> 3795.64
hey cleary

3816.64 --> 3821.1189999999997
right well ben white i don't know

3818.4 --> 3822.839
exactly how that works it different for

3821.119 --> 3826.1600000000003
government i

3822.839 --> 3826.16
think but

3826.88 --> 3832.48
like politicians and [ __ ] they do weird

3830.4 --> 3834.4
freaky deals

3832.48 --> 3836.48
so a lot of the times you just think oh

3834.4 --> 3839.599
we're paying taxes for this that means

3836.48 --> 3841.76
that's going to pay even out like the

3839.599 --> 3842.7200000000003
issues in that sector

3841.76 --> 3846.4
no

3842.72 --> 3846.3999999999996
a lot of the times it isn't

3848.799 --> 3853.359
it's going somewhere else something that

3851.039 --> 3855.039
you might completely not agree with or

3853.359 --> 3856.64
even something you didn't even realize

3855.039 --> 3858.96
like that's getting abused right now

3856.64 --> 3862.24
it's not working it's just oh yeah it's

3858.96 --> 3864.2400000000002
routed to like that though

3862.24 --> 3867.24
it's just gonna do that

3864.24 --> 3867.24
right

3874.16 --> 3880.64
so yeah when tax systems are not

3878.0 --> 3882.4
foolproof when they're like broken yeah

3880.64 --> 3884.96
that's when government employees start

3882.4 --> 3886.559
to basically abuse it

3884.96 --> 3889.839
and you get these politicians that are

3886.559 --> 3892.4
like oh i'm gonna use this money now

3889.839 --> 3893.2
for this

3892.4 --> 3896.88
like

3893.2 --> 3898.64
whoa the biggest pro lgbt parade ever

3896.88 --> 3900.559
and we're just gonna use that money for

3898.64 --> 3902.799
it like but how

3900.559 --> 3904.96
well it wasn't really

3902.799 --> 3907.52
going anywhere anyways like the

3904.96 --> 3909.2
program's not set up so

3907.52 --> 3911.2
yeah all that money is just still there

3909.2 --> 3912.0789999999997
so we're just gonna use that now for

3911.2 --> 3913.5989999999997
this

3912.079 --> 3916.319
bet you didn't think that was gonna

3913.599 --> 3916.319
happen right

3916.64 --> 3922.5589999999997
yeah welcome to government

3919.839 --> 3925.5589999999997
a modern government that is western

3922.559 --> 3925.559
government

3955.52 --> 3960.48
yeah most of the time ben white

3958.319 --> 3962.319
well it's not it's not that bad

3960.48 --> 3966.96
everywhere though

3962.319 --> 3969.44
but our country has had those issues too

3966.96 --> 3972.96
now it seems like our tax system now is

3969.44 --> 3975.359
pretty decent it's decently wired but

3972.96 --> 3979.839
yeah the government functionaries that

3975.359 --> 3979.839
are now sitting on top of all that

3981.039 --> 3984.559
it's like they're just trying to destroy

3983.119 --> 3987.039
it

3984.559 --> 3990.6400000000003
they're just completely using the

3987.039 --> 3993.8390000000004
efficiency of the entire vehicle

3990.64 --> 3993.839
to blackmail people

3999.119 --> 4002.799
that's why they need to be dethroned

4000.88 --> 4005.799
because they are going to wreck

4002.799 --> 4005.799
everything

4006.4 --> 4010.2400000000002
and they need to be toppled they need to

4008.24 --> 4013.24
be kicked out

4010.24 --> 4013.24
quick

4029.119 --> 4032.119

4376.159 --> 4381.36
out of control noisy teenager that's

a bit boring right but at least she's

4460.32 --> 4463.599999999999
not

4461.84 --> 4466.0
i don't know exactly what she's like

4463.6 --> 4466.0
really

4467.199 --> 4471.759999999999
hey lsg

4469.52 --> 4475.1990000000005
yeah okay enough with the shitty jokes

4471.76 --> 4475.1990000000005
akumu virus we get it

4477.199 --> 4480.96
you shouldn't get high in the morning

4478.88 --> 4485.56
and then make shitty jokes in my chat

4480.96 --> 4485.56
akumu virus you're pissing me off

4508.0 --> 4511.36
and this program right that's awesome

4510.0 --> 4514.719
yeah so you could take her out for

4511.36 --> 4514.719
shooting and all that that's great

4515.04 --> 4518.32
like

4515.92 --> 4520.32
if you really needed to give her like a

4518.32 --> 4523.04
builder body function then at least she

4520.32 --> 4525.84
could be like a guard

4523.04 --> 4525.84
you know

4547.84 --> 4553.04
right but i don't know maybe

4550.08 --> 4555.679
maybe we should kind of adapt

4553.04 --> 4557.44
i'm starting to kind of really you

4555.679 --> 4559.36
should be realizing we're joking around

4557.44 --> 4560.48
right now at this point not serious at

4559.36 --> 4562.639999999999
all

4560.48 --> 4566.4
but maybe we should like

4562.64 --> 4567.92
consider treating politicians more like

4566.4 --> 4571.36
pets right

4567.92 --> 4574.719
i mean you can get a cat and all that

4571.36 --> 4579.04
even from like a cat breeder or a dog

4574.719 --> 4581.84
but yeah if if they then like

4579.04 --> 4581.84
yeah

4582.56 --> 4586.320000000001
the owner dies or they're like they're

4584.719 --> 4589.199
terrible

4586.32 --> 4591.28
you just send them to the vet

4589.199 --> 4592.48
and they yeah they're probably just

4591.28 --> 4595.5199999999995
gonna

4592.48 --> 4596.799999999999
either to them or just put them to sleep

4595.52 --> 4598.56
right

4596.8 --> 4600.56
that's how i think we should deal with

4598.56 --> 4602.2390000000005
politicians

4600.56 --> 4605.120000000001
right that would

4602.239 --> 4605.12
be more

4605.36 --> 4608.36
pragmatic

4608.8 --> 4613.6
right because politicians like once they

4611.6 --> 4615.280000000001
get rabies once they suddenly think

4613.6 --> 4617.360000000001
they're god and [ __ ]

4615.28 --> 4619.199
they're not stopping right they're just

4617.36 --> 4620.239
out of control they're not fulfilling

4619.199 --> 4622.5599999999995
their functioning they're just

4620.239 --> 4623.5199999999995
disrupting you gotta send them to the

4622.56 --> 4627.04
vet

4623.52 --> 4629.360000000001
and put them to sleep

4627.04 --> 4631.44
everybody's better off you still have

4629.36 --> 4633.199
good memories of when he was they were

4631.44 --> 4634.32
still halfway

4633.199 --> 4636.5599999999995
good and

4634.32 --> 4638.639999999999
everybody can forget about how terrible

4636.56 --> 4639.84
they were you just gotta put them to

4638.64 --> 4642.4800000000005
sleep just

4639.84 --> 4643.4400000000005
just like a a pet

4642.48 --> 4646.4
that's

4643.44 --> 4648.5599999999995
just out of control has gone insane or

4646.4 --> 4650.08
it's like got rabies

4648.56 --> 4653.6
right that's how we should treat

4650.08 --> 4655.44
politicians i think that would

4653.6 --> 4656.8
safeguard

4655.44 --> 4660.719
the future

4656.8 --> 4660.719
if we'd actually choose to do that

4661.92 --> 4664.92
right

4669.44 --> 4672.599999999999
[Music]

4674.8 --> 4678.4400000000005

[Music]

4786.0 --> 4789.56
hey clap ruckus

4800.0 --> 4803.56
hey tony welcome

4809.04 --> 4812.32
you know there are only two parties yeah

4810.56 --> 4815.04
well over here there is

4812.32 --> 4816.84
a multitude of parties

4815.04 --> 4819.199
but half of them

4816.84 --> 4821.360000000001
are basically

4819.199 --> 4823.44
like the democrat party

4821.36 --> 4825.28
posing

4823.44 --> 4827.7699999999995
as a separate party

4825.28 --> 4829.04
and they're all just like

4827.77 --> 4830.639
[Music]

4829.04 --> 4834.0
yeah

4830.639 --> 4836.0
cogs in the same clockwork

4834.0 --> 4838.159
and they are just almost like well

4836.0 --> 4841.92
they're openly conspiring they're just

4838.159 --> 4841.92
openly conspiring and doing that

4842.239 --> 4847.919999999999
right

4843.92 --> 4851.4400000000005
so mostly the here in my country the vvd

4847.92 --> 4854.0
terrible monsters

4851.44 --> 4857.839999999999
you have the 66

4854.0 --> 4860.4
very un driven corrupt

4857.84 --> 4862.719
anti-human really secretly

4860.4 --> 4865.679
but while posing to be super pro human

4862.719 --> 4865.679
it's very sick

4866.8 --> 4872.2390000000005
vvd is just much more pragmatic about

4869.36 --> 4875.36
profit but they are like psychopaths

4872.239 --> 4877.919999999999
with it they they don't care

4875.36 --> 4880.08
and then there's the pvda

4877.92 --> 4880.96
the labor party

4880.08 --> 4883.12
which

4880.96 --> 4884.32
is literally

4883.12 --> 4886.5599999999995
well

4884.32 --> 4887.599999999999
destroying [ __ ] like they're not about

4886.56 --> 4890.719
labor

4887.6 --> 4892.8
at all anymore they're they have turned

4890.719 --> 4895.76
around they're like

4892.8 --> 4895.76
an atrocity

4896.719 --> 4899.52
they are literally an atrocity they're

4898.56 --> 4901.4400000000005
now

4899.52 --> 4904.400000000001
going against

4901.44 --> 4906.96
labor forces in their standard long-term

4904.4 --> 4906.96
policies

4907.199 --> 4912.159
and they're also a part of it right and

4909.36 --> 4913.92
they're all like cogs in it in a single

4912.159 --> 4916.4
clockwork so whether you have two

4913.92 --> 4917.6
parties or we have a bunch of fragmented

4916.4 --> 4919.839999999999
parties

4917.6 --> 4921.6
that just give the appearance more like

4919.84 --> 4923.92
their separate parties even though they

4921.6 --> 4926.56
are openly conspiring

4923.92 --> 4928.88
in a very systematic way recognizable to

4926.56 --> 4930.88
the outside world more than to the

4928.88 --> 4932.32
inside world

4930.88 --> 4934.639
then you realize it doesn't really

4932.32 --> 4934.639
matter

4939.76 --> 4945.12
we've got it

4941.52 --> 4949.400000000001
just as bad as in the united states

4945.12 --> 4949.4
when it comes to political structure

4984.239 --> 4988.638999999999
hmm

4985.86 --> 4991.639
[Music]

4988.639 --> 4991.639
right

5019.6 --> 5022.6
hmm

5045.52 --> 5048.84
little gas

5061.36 --> 5066.0
so anybody else wants to adopt a

5063.28 --> 5066.0
politician

5068.96 --> 5074.96
i mean you could literally just play a

5072.56 --> 5076.2390000000005
worldwide game with this and just play

5074.96 --> 5078.159
that game

5076.239 --> 5080.5599999999995
adopt a politician

5078.159 --> 5082.719
so you go through the entire list of all

5080.56 --> 5083.679
the politicians of your country all of

5082.719 --> 5086.96
them

5083.679 --> 5086.96
and and consider

5087.04 --> 5090.719
which one would i

5088.56 --> 5092.719
actually take in

5090.719 --> 5094.2390000000005
as a guest

5092.719 --> 5096.96
to like live

5094.239 --> 5099.839999999999
for let's say a year

5096.96 --> 5099.84
right

5101.28 --> 5106.88
and then figure out like okay

5105.199 --> 5111.12
the ones that are left that literally

5106.88 --> 5114.719
nobody wants to take well they should be

5111.12 --> 5114.719
like rejected

5119.679 --> 5123.4800000000005
they're probably infiltrators

5133.92 --> 5140.04
right i mean i don't understand even why

5136.8 --> 5140.04
in politics

5140.8 --> 5149.28
can give other politicians power

5145.44 --> 5149.28
i don't even understand how that works

5149.6 --> 5153.400000000001
like why that's possible

5156.32 --> 5160.719
but yeah then again

5158.8 --> 5164.92
i'm not a politician

5160.719 --> 5164.92
so i'm not up for adoption

5185.84 --> 5189.28
but yeah isn't that

5187.6 --> 5191.52
it didn't

5189.28 --> 5193.759999999999
didn't do

5191.52 --> 5195.6
wasn't there like a system originally

5193.76 --> 5196.400000000001
like even in 20th century where it's

5195.6 --> 5198.639
like

5196.4 --> 5202.0
you have to have

5198.639 --> 5202.96
actual virtues to even be allowed into

5202.0 --> 5205.199
office

5202.96 --> 5205.199
right

5205.52 --> 5208.4800000000005
where's that gone

5207.679 --> 5210.56
what

5208.48 --> 5212.879999999999
where's that gun

5210.56 --> 5216.88
i mean seriously there's like biden is

5212.88 --> 5216.88
now supposedly your seating president

5217.84 --> 5220.8
what happened

5220.96 --> 5227.12
i mean that's just beyond unthinkable

5224.4 --> 5230.48
compared to say 50 years ago it is

5227.12 --> 5230.48
beyond unthinkable

5234.8 --> 5238.96
wasn't there supposed to be like

5236.48 --> 5242.718999999999
standards for politicians and they they

5238.96 --> 5242.719
couldn't have scandals

5243.92 --> 5246.56
what happened

5247.44 --> 5250.159
did

5248.639 --> 5252.88
people just

5250.159 --> 5255.679
completely give up all standards in

5252.88 --> 5256.96
favor of some political

5255.679 --> 5259.36
win

5256.96 --> 5263.32
that just give up everything is

5259.36 --> 5263.32
everything okay now

5268.159 --> 5273.159
and why why would you do that to

5270.159 --> 5273.159
yourself

5308.08 --> 5313.12
yeah

5309.36 --> 5313.12
that's annoying adam price yeah

5314.88 --> 5318.400000000001
you seem to be the only one having that

5316.8 --> 5323.0
issue though

5318.4 --> 5323.0
it's weird that it keeps happening

5323.6 --> 5327.1990000000005
i had a bit of that weird delay effect

5325.679 --> 5330.4800000000005
too

5327.199 --> 5333.04
like but that's a while ago now that

5330.48 --> 5334.879999999999
that's like at least a year ago it

5333.04 --> 5337.12
doesn't really happen anymore i'm very

5334.88 --> 5339.1990000000005
glad of it by the way it's it sucks to

5337.12 --> 5342.08
constantly have delay on your own

5339.199 --> 5342.08
freaking stream

5344.719 --> 5351.6
no good servant what are you talking

5347.28 --> 5353.84
about nothing is real

5351.6 --> 5357.76
what

5353.84 --> 5357.76
back to differ it is real

5360.719 --> 5364.679
things are definitely real

5367.6 --> 5372.0
political nothing political is real

5398.32 --> 5402.48
what is real

5400.719 --> 5405.4800000000005
what is wrong yeah i knew that was

5402.48 --> 5405.48
coming

5415.92 --> 5419.76
what is real well i'd say

5418.159 --> 5421.759999999999
anything that

5419.76 --> 5425.04
holds up and holds out without

5421.76 --> 5425.04
preconceived notions

5432.96 --> 5437.92
if it just is

5434.639 --> 5440.96
it is and that it's real

5437.92 --> 5443.76
but if it only is complete

5440.96 --> 5446.84
and logical when you add something on

5443.76 --> 5448.719
top of it mentally a pre

5446.84 --> 5449.84
preconception

5448.719 --> 5453.36
then

5449.84 --> 5453.360000000001
it's probably not real

5456.8 --> 5461.6
is the supernatural real well that

5459.76 --> 5463.84
depends on what you mean with the

5461.6 --> 5466.88
supernatural

5463.84 --> 5469.1990000000005
do you mean the supernatural within the

5466.88 --> 5471.12
field of physics

5469.199 --> 5474.12
or do you mean the colloquial

5471.12 --> 5474.12
supernatural

5479.84 --> 5484.0
all right because then if this is the

5481.679 --> 5486.96
colloquial you're basically asking are

5484.0 --> 5486.96
dreams real

5487.36 --> 5494.08
well yeah they are

5491.04 --> 5494.08
they really do happen

5498.159 --> 5503.92
in physics is the supernatural real yeah

5501.28 --> 5508.48
it is it's provable

5503.92 --> 5508.4800000000005
knowing in the field of information

5508.56 --> 5513.120000000001
information is a substance knowing is a

5511.36 --> 5514.5599999999995
variable

5513.12 --> 5516.84
it is a

5514.56 --> 5520.8
provable

5516.84 --> 5523.04
thing a substance

5520.8 --> 5527.639
so the supernatural is

5523.04 --> 5527.639
real within the field of physics

5533.679 --> 5537.52
that's incorrect akuma virus

5541.44 --> 5547.36
don't know who this physics is that

5544.639 --> 5548.88
you're mentioning but the physics that i

5547.36 --> 5551.04
know

5548.88 --> 5553.1990000000005
the supernatural is

5551.04 --> 5555.12
absolutely something you can do

5553.199 --> 5556.799999999999
something scientific with

5555.12 --> 5558.84
it's called the knowing which path

5556.8 --> 5560.360000000001
experiment right where

5558.84 --> 5563.12
knowing

5560.36 --> 5566.08
supernatural effect

5563.12 --> 5566.08
and elements

5567.28 --> 5572.8
that require conscious

5569.28 --> 5575.199
observation basically knowing

5572.8 --> 5577.52
is the variable

5575.199 --> 5580.159
it is supernatural

5577.52 --> 5582.8
because it is not material light

5580.159 --> 5586.92
electric it is only something that takes

5582.8 --> 5586.92
place within the mind

5588.96 --> 5594.2390000000005
in the field of information

5591.679 --> 5595.92
it's supernatural but it's tangible

5594.239 --> 5598.159
though because you can vary and

5595.92 --> 5599.1990000000005
manipulate it within an experiment in

5598.159 --> 5600.48
order to

5599.199 --> 5603.719
cause

5600.48 --> 5603.718999999999
an effect

5605.44 --> 5609.199
dude

5606.4 --> 5612.719
i'm not gonna look up your stupid weirdo

5609.199 --> 5612.719
sources akumu virus

5613.12 --> 5617.599999999999
look you dug up something new that's

5615.199 --> 5619.199
super cute go bring it to nathan on

5617.6 --> 5621.280000000001
monday

5619.199 --> 5623.28
yeah that's not my chat's not the place

5621.28 --> 5625.04
i know what i'm talking about your

5623.28 --> 5628.759999999999
blabbering nonsense

5625.04 --> 5628.76
i'm not having it

5632.239 --> 5636.959999999999
no

5633.92 --> 5638.159
that's just incorrect

5636.96 --> 5639.679
knowing

5638.159 --> 5644.839999999999
is not

5639.679 --> 5644.84
physical you understand akuma virus

5647.28 --> 5652.5599999999995
it's a natural super no

5649.84 --> 5655.1990000000005
supernatural

5652.56 --> 5658.2390000000005
can also be part of the natural and

5655.199 --> 5660.5599999999995
physical world

5658.239 --> 5662.239
it's just not material

5660.56 --> 5663.360000000001
or

5662.239 --> 5666.759999999999
energy

5663.36 --> 5666.759999999999
or light

5674.4 --> 5676.5599999999995
all right if we can do science on it

5675.84 --> 5678.639
it's

5676.56 --> 5680.96
it's natural well that's not

5678.639 --> 5683.36
that's colloquial natural that that is

5680.96 --> 5683.36
different

5684.639 --> 5690.08
in that sense yeah the supernatural is

5687.119 --> 5690.08
also natural

5691.84 --> 5698.1990000000005
because you can very manipulate it in

5694.32 --> 5698.199
order to cause an effect

5715.04 --> 5717.28
no

5718.239 --> 5721.239
yes

5728.29 --> 5731.359
[Music]

5733.28 --> 5738.239
that has to be it has to be a naturally

5735.84 --> 5740.8
occurring phenomenon

5738.239 --> 5741.839999999999
something that happens naturally

5740.8 --> 5745.4800000000005
knowing

5741.84 --> 5745.4800000000005
is supernatural

5746.0 --> 5750.239
but

5747.44 --> 5753.04
it happens naturally

5750.239 --> 5755.199
yeah so this is getting all very

5753.04 --> 5758.32
complicated and twisted up like a

5755.199 --> 5760.32
guardian knot if you keep this going

5758.32 --> 5762.799999999999
because there's like two different

5760.32 --> 5764.799999999999
applications of the same word that are

5762.8 --> 5765.76
used in a singular

5764.8 --> 5768.0
field

5765.76 --> 5770.08
so yeah it's getting really confusing i

5768.0 --> 5772.08
know it's getting confusing to me too

5770.08 --> 5774.96
but i am getting it straight i do know

5772.08 --> 5774.96
what i'm talking about

5775.04 --> 5779.679
knowing

5777.04 --> 5782.8
is under the field of information

5779.679 --> 5786.96
information is supernatural

5782.8 --> 5789.76
you can vary and manipulate it in order

5786.96 --> 5790.96
to scientifically prove that it is a

5789.76 --> 5793.92
substance

5790.96 --> 5795.36
a supernatural substance

5793.92 --> 5799.84
which is

5795.36 --> 5799.839999999999
occurring in the natural world

5800.0 --> 5805.119
doesn't only occur in man-made devices

5802.4 --> 5807.759999999999
knowing is something that happens

5805.119 --> 5811.639
that people can

5807.76 --> 5811.639
prove that they do

5812.4 --> 5816.96
right but it is not material it is not

5814.96 --> 5819.36
electric it is not

5816.96 --> 5819.36
light

5820.08 --> 5825.28
it's none of those things

5822.0 --> 5826.88
but it is a substance a supernatural

5825.28 --> 5829.88
substance

5826.88 --> 5829.88
knowing

5842.159 --> 5846.5599999999995
what are the allowed ways to manipulate

5844.32 --> 5849.04
independent anyway you can manipulate an

5846.56 --> 5851.370000000001
independent variable as as any way you

5849.04 --> 5852.639
like technological

5851.37 --> 5855.36
[Music]

5852.639 --> 5856.96
anything simple or as complicated as you

5855.36 --> 5860.08
like as long

5856.96 --> 5862.159
as the independent variable

5860.08 --> 5863.28
is not a man-made

5862.159 --> 5866.5599999999995
thing

5863.28 --> 5868.719
it has to occur naturally in nature it

5866.56 --> 5873.360000000001
has to happen

5868.719 --> 5876.88
right well people knowing things

5873.36 --> 5876.88
that happens in nature

5877.92 --> 5883.84
right

5879.44 --> 5883.839999999999
you can prove somebody knows something

5884.08 --> 5890.0
if you have

5885.92 --> 5891.1990000000005
let's say a place that has like

5890.0 --> 5892.8
ten

5891.199 --> 5895.44
fake doors

5892.8 --> 5897.52
and or nine fake doors and and one real

5895.44 --> 5899.599999999999
door

5897.52 --> 5903.52
if somebody's gonna walk up

5899.6 --> 5903.52
to the right door the first go

5903.6 --> 5907.04
and they just open it immediately and go

5906.239 --> 5910.4
through

5907.04 --> 5913.5199999999995
you have proof that they know

5910.4 --> 5913.5199999999995
what the right door is

5915.04 --> 5917.36
yeah

5917.76 --> 5923.1990000000005
it happens naturally

5920.0 --> 5927.04
the knowing part is a natural occurrence

5923.199 --> 5931.119
now how to test that knowing

5927.04 --> 5933.44
can be comprised of man-made devices

5931.119 --> 5934.639
it's just that the knowing part the

5933.44 --> 5937.119
thing that's going to be very to

5934.639 --> 5941.28
manipulate within the experiment that

5937.119 --> 5943.92
part has to occur completely naturally

5941.28 --> 5947.92
knowing happens naturally

5943.92 --> 5947.92
it is a viable phenomenon

5948.719 --> 5953.84
it is supernatural though it doesn't

5950.639 --> 5956.2390000000005
have any

5953.84 --> 5959.360000000001
material aspect to it

5956.239 --> 5962.48
or light or electricity

5959.36 --> 5965.88
but it probably does exist

5962.48 --> 5965.879999999999
within nature

5982.239 --> 5984.48
what

5984.719 --> 5992.44
my favorite ex no

5988.56 --> 5992.4400000000005
that was talking about

5997.36 --> 6002.719
i don't remember any of that the only

5999.84 --> 6003.679
scientific experiment that's like really

6002.719 --> 6005.84
valid

6003.679 --> 6009.76
that i know even at this point that i

6005.84 --> 6012.4800000000005
can remember is the egg experiment

6009.76 --> 6013.84
the relative density experiment that's

6012.48 --> 6016.08
the one

6013.84 --> 6021.0
and it's very important

6016.08 --> 6021.0
so i guess i take i'll pick that one

6030.4 --> 6034.719
beyond scientific understand no

6034.88 --> 6038.639
no that's not what that means at all

6048.56 --> 6054.400000000001
supernatural simply means

6052.0 --> 6057.76
outside of

6054.4 --> 6060.32
the creation outside the nature right

6057.76 --> 6063.92
information knowledge

6060.32 --> 6065.599999999999
that's outside of that created nature it

6063.92 --> 6067.36
is more directly from god the

6065.6 --> 6069.119000000001
information all information comes from

6067.36 --> 6070.799999999999
god all the information we get in our

6069.119 --> 6072.48
minds ideas

6070.8 --> 6074.400000000001
different memories

6072.48 --> 6077.5199999999995
it's all

6074.4 --> 6078.48
not based on the material world but

6077.52 --> 6081.76
actually

6078.48 --> 6083.599999999999
formed outside of it through god

6081.76 --> 6086.88
information

6083.6 --> 6086.88
outside of creation

6087.84 --> 6092.719
but it is

6089.84 --> 6094.0
provable and tangible

6092.719 --> 6095.199
within

6094.0 --> 6096.639
nature

6095.199 --> 6101.119
it exists

6096.639 --> 6104.2390000000005
inside of nature it is not nature it is

6101.119 --> 6108.32
not literally part of creation

6104.239 --> 6109.919999999999
exists outside of it but inside of it in

6108.32 --> 6111.5199999999995
between it

6109.92 --> 6115.28
among it

6111.52 --> 6116.96
the supernatural is among nature

6115.28 --> 6119.41
through us

6116.96 --> 6122.6
through god

6119.41 --> 6122.599999999999
[Music]

6125.92 --> 6133.28
yeah and it is provable within physics

6131.28 --> 6135.28
you understand

6133.28 --> 6137.599999999999
the supernatural

6135.28 --> 6141.36
is tangible it is a

6137.6 --> 6144.88
conceivable substance that is provable

6141.36 --> 6149.599999999999
within the field of physics

6144.88 --> 6153.36
yes the supernatural is provable within

6149.6 --> 6155.92
the field of physics

6153.36 --> 6155.92
deal with it

6161.6 --> 6166.56
keep denying

6164.0 --> 6168.08
i can't understand something it is not

6166.56 --> 6169.4400000000005
dude you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

6168.08 --> 6171.44
talking you're talking about a

6169.44 --> 6174.0
colloquial

6171.44 --> 6176.32
supernatural zack you're talking about

6174.0 --> 6178.159
spooky ghost nonsense

6176.32 --> 6179.679
that's not supernatural that we're

6178.159 --> 6181.44
talking about we're talking in the field

6179.679 --> 6184.0
of physics

6181.44 --> 6184.0
physics

6184.56 --> 6187.52
yeah

6185.56 --> 6191.04
information

6187.52 --> 6194.159000000001
the supernatural substance

6191.04 --> 6197.44
the thing that is not naturally

6194.159 --> 6198.879999999999
formed without god

6197.44 --> 6201.5199999999995
through us

6198.88 --> 6204.32
in formation understanding through our

6201.52 --> 6208.0
consciousness

6204.32 --> 6211.44
but it takes place within nature among

6208.0 --> 6215.76
nature and you can vary and manipulate

6211.44 --> 6219.32
it in order to prove it scientifically

6215.76 --> 6219.320000000001
within nature

6222.56 --> 6226.56
not talking about the dictionary

6224.239 --> 6229.44
definition zack we're talking about

6226.56 --> 6229.4400000000005
physics here

6231.28 --> 6235.44
physics specifically physics

6244.8 --> 6248.719
yeah i feel you're going in circles

6246.639 --> 6251.04
indeed because you're not listening to

6248.719 --> 6252.88
what i'm saying

6251.04 --> 6255.44
yeah i know there's

6252.88 --> 6256.639
a lot of different views and opinions

6255.44 --> 6259.839999999999
that you can

6256.639 --> 6262.4800000000005
read into out there

6259.84 --> 6264.639
and none of them are hyper specific

6262.48 --> 6265.759999999999
in the way that i'm trying to be right

6264.639 --> 6269.76
now

6265.76 --> 6273.4400000000005
specifically within the field of physics

6269.76 --> 6276.159000000001
yeah this is not a generally written

6273.44 --> 6278.5599999999995
about subject

6276.159 --> 6280.879999999999
you gotta dig

6278.56 --> 6282.88
in odd places

6280.88 --> 6285.6
to even find that [ __ ]

6282.88 --> 6288.56
because most people just do colloquial

6285.6 --> 6291.84
nonsense wizard talk yeah all the

6288.56 --> 6294.080000000001
atheist garbage people roll out the same

6291.84 --> 6296.2390000000005
garbage supernatural it can be

6294.08 --> 6298.8
supernatural you can't have supernatural

6296.239 --> 6301.28
than physics it's supernatural it's not

6298.8 --> 6303.119000000001
natural and yeah there is no god anyway

6301.28 --> 6305.5199999999995
so we're just going to completely cut it

6303.119 --> 6307.92
out oh yeah what about the

6305.52 --> 6311.4400000000005
knowing which path experiment

6307.92 --> 6313.36
within quantum mechanics that proves

6311.44 --> 6317.199
that knowledge

6313.36 --> 6319.199
knowing which path information not

6317.199 --> 6321.5199999999995
physically palpable

6319.199 --> 6324.239
light or electric

6321.52 --> 6325.6
but information

6324.239 --> 6327.678999999999
yeah

6325.6 --> 6330.8
it's proven it's right out there it's in

6327.679 --> 6333.04
the books yeah it's a proven substance

6330.8 --> 6335.679
so you can blabber on all day about how

6333.04 --> 6338.32
you're so intellectual and all if

6335.679 --> 6340.4800000000005
supernatural thought can't be natural

6338.32 --> 6343.28
though it can't be physics yeah blabber

6340.48 --> 6345.839999999999
on your [ __ ] it's wrong

6343.28 --> 6348.639
it's an officially recognized honored

6345.84 --> 6352.639
experiment within quantum physics

6348.639 --> 6354.52
supernatural is a substance that you can

6352.639 --> 6359.56
prove

6354.52 --> 6359.56
scientifically through experimentation

6359.679 --> 6364.4800000000005
you get it

6361.92 --> 6367.6
so keep on listening to your blabbering

6364.48 --> 6368.5599999999995
atheist nonsense quotes and nonsense

6367.6 --> 6370.56
talk

6368.56 --> 6373.119000000001
a bunch of idiots

6370.56 --> 6375.4400000000005
or you could actually go to the official

6373.119 --> 6375.44
books

6376.8 --> 6381.52
bring it to feynman

6379.84 --> 6383.28
he was dealing with that [ __ ] all over

6381.52 --> 6385.119000000001
the place

6383.28 --> 6389.639
you don't get it i know you don't get it

6385.119 --> 6389.639
zack i know i know you don't

6451.199 --> 6456.28
okay

6452.08 --> 6456.28
well i gotta agree with you there

6456.32 --> 6459.44
okay

6457.36 --> 6462.0
yeah

6459.44 --> 6463.759999999999
physics is a part of science entropy is

6462.0 --> 6465.76
entropy regardless

6463.76 --> 6467.52
of if you're talking about physics or

6465.76 --> 6469.360000000001
chemistry yeah

6467.52 --> 6471.6
can't say anything wrongs about that

6469.36 --> 6476.08
statement

6471.6 --> 6476.08
did statement do any real science yeah

6476.8 --> 6482.400000000001
i uh i believe that he was like

6479.84 --> 6485.119000000001
part of actually the engineering

6482.4 --> 6487.04
figuring out

6485.119 --> 6490.0
of the machines

6487.04 --> 6490.0
in the experiments

6491.36 --> 6494.5599999999995
he was

6492.639 --> 6497.1990000000005
right on top of that at least i think he

6494.56 --> 6498.639
was mostly a theorist

6497.199 --> 6501.199
like a

6498.639 --> 6503.119
mathematician and all that

6501.199 --> 6506.0
physicist

6503.119 --> 6507.199
but he did a lot of experiments he was a

6506.0 --> 6510.719
real

6507.199 --> 6513.44
physicist not just theoretical

6510.719 --> 6515.44
and

6513.44 --> 6519.199
i'm pretty sure that he was right on top

6515.44 --> 6519.199
of the knowing which path experiment

6523.52 --> 6526.400000000001
is

6524.239 --> 6528.08
engineering science no

6526.4 --> 6532.239
engineering is

6528.08 --> 6535.199
also known as applied sciences

6532.239 --> 6538.0
it is not science it is

6535.199 --> 6541.0
the expertise and mastery of man-made

6538.0 --> 6541.0
devices

6566.4 --> 6569.5199999999995
oh dear idea

6578.159 --> 6585.32
well ben white they should

6580.8 --> 6585.320000000001
unfortunately a lot of them really don't

6614.4 --> 6616.719
right

6618.56 --> 6623.96
i think i'm gonna round out the show

6620.4 --> 6623.96
getting a bit hungry

6625.199 --> 6629.598999999999
it's been

6626.159 --> 6629.598999999999
been pretty interesting though

6633.199 --> 6638.08
intense first half

6635.119 --> 6640.4
and a lot of physics the second part

6638.08 --> 6644.0
that was pretty cool

6640.4 --> 6644.0
it's good to get back to all that

6645.44 --> 6653.0
theoretical physics contradict yeah it

6648.32 --> 6653.0
kind of is yeah then white

6666.96 --> 6672.4800000000005
kumu's not getting it

6670.159 --> 6672.48
right

6675.92 --> 6679.04
so

6676.719 --> 6681.119
i am rounding out thanks everyone for

6679.04 --> 6682.96
coming i hope you liked this show i

6681.119 --> 6685.199
thought it was so myself it was pretty

6682.96 --> 6685.199
good

6686.56 --> 6691.84
lots of activity today and that's great

6689.119 --> 6694.719
very thankful for that

6691.84 --> 6697.04
anyhow if you like this show then please

6732.719 --> 6737.52
and i will

6734.32 --> 6740.0
yeah i will strive to be on there again

6737.52 --> 6742.159000000001
last time was great so looking forward

to that

6742.159 --> 6749.0
and until the next video

6745.04 --> 6749.0
keep it flat
