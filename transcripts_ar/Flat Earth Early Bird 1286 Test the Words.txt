94.079 --> 99.05
so yeah starting late today

96.32 --> 100.39999999999999
it's gonna be short show

99.05 --> 102.79899999999999
[Music]

100.4 --> 106.56
weather

102.799 --> 110.64
is such utterly clouded it's

106.56 --> 113.36
there's no blue spot in between today

110.64 --> 114.72
it's a big haze

113.36 --> 115.6
of cloud

114.72 --> 117.6
and it

115.6 --> 120.32
yeah there has been a little bit of rain

117.6 --> 122.64
actually here and there

120.32 --> 125.75899999999999
when i went out for groceries i did

122.64 --> 129.479
catch some droplets but

125.759 --> 129.479
nothing more than that

133.2 --> 137.04
i think it cool off some more

137.09 --> 140.169
[Music]

140.319 --> 144.07999999999998
the way it's looking it's probably going

141.84 --> 146.879
to be raining

144.08 --> 146.87900000000002
in the evening

148.0 --> 151.16
all right

155.21 --> 158.99
[Music]

160.0 --> 165.2
it's

161.44 --> 165.2
still 20 degrees apparently

165.599 --> 169.879
73 participation

180.72 --> 183.72
yo

187.76 --> 191.159
where's everybody

204.48 --> 209.28
i guess i'm not the only one being a

206.64 --> 212.0
little late today

209.28 --> 214.239
maybe it's just one of those mondays i

212.0 --> 215.76
had a really restless night though and

214.239 --> 218.239
like

215.76 --> 221.28
really had to like force myself to go to

218.239 --> 221.28
bed because it was just

221.36 --> 225.36
did not want to go

223.76 --> 227.51899999999998
because yesterday overall was pretty

225.36 --> 230.72000000000003
exhilarating day

227.519 --> 233.20000000000002
i mean i had really agreed the show was

230.72 --> 233.2
great

233.28 --> 237.28
it was

235.04 --> 239.28
yeah

237.28 --> 242.159
really interesting i watched it back and

239.28 --> 244.4
i'm still thinking about it like

242.159 --> 244.4
yeah

245.04 --> 248.319
i'm on to something here

250.799 --> 259.759
oh and yeah the the saturday show

254.56 --> 259.759
1284 it still only has one upvote

261.12 --> 264.32
very very odd

265.84 --> 271.32
but yeah at least yesterday's show did

267.6 --> 271.32000000000005
not have that problem

307.28 --> 310.28
uh

332.4 --> 337.35999999999996
right

334.0 --> 338.56
so there's nobody here for some reason

337.36 --> 340.8
i don't know

338.56 --> 344.639
maybe i felt it coming i was almost

340.8 --> 346.72
gonna like completely skip today's show

344.639 --> 348.479
because well because yesterday's show

346.72 --> 350.24
was so great

348.479 --> 352.88
it was really great

350.24 --> 355.12
usually when that happens i get all

352.88 --> 358.15999999999997
like high energy

355.12 --> 358.16
and overload a bit

360.24 --> 363.52
and then the next show is like really

362.56 --> 366.8
drained

363.52 --> 369.44
so it today is that show

366.8 --> 371.84000000000003
and that's why i also chose to basically

369.44 --> 372.88
start late then like kind of keep it

371.84 --> 374.15999999999997
short

372.88 --> 376.24
because

374.16 --> 379.38000000000005
i just gave a lot

376.24 --> 382.5
on yesterday's show

379.38 --> 382.5
[Music]

382.639 --> 387.36
finally hello gadget inspector first

385.199 --> 391.199
chat

387.36 --> 391.199
daniel robles good to see

392.84 --> 400.59999999999997
you it is monday by the way the

396.24 --> 400.6
27th of june 2022

420.4 --> 426.63899999999995
yeah yesterday

422.88 --> 426.639
a lot of interesting videos

430.0 --> 433.68
jimbo was live that was great

434.0 --> 437.24
as usual

437.68 --> 443.039
uh what's

439.759 --> 443.039
the quantum of conscious

444.96 --> 449.28
did i actually yeah i did watch it i

446.88 --> 453.8
watched a whole bunch of videos but it

449.28 --> 453.79999999999995
in my mind it's blended in a bit

479.52 --> 484.0
have you heard of force the line

482.56 --> 488.52
experiment

484.0 --> 488.52
that does ring a bell a bit

492.8 --> 498.68
i don't exactly know or remember what it

495.68 --> 498.68
is

517.919 --> 522.399
first thing that comes up when i google

519.76 --> 524.959
it is some reddit

522.399 --> 526.959
page although it is like globe

524.959 --> 530.0799999999999
skepticism so

526.959 --> 532.399
is that what you're talking about

530.08 --> 534.48
guess that there has been a flat earther

532.399 --> 536.56
channel called force the line is that

534.48 --> 539.44
what you were talking about

536.56 --> 539.4399999999999
daniel robles

542.08 --> 547.24
because otherwise i have no idea what

543.76 --> 547.24
you're talking about

569.92 --> 574.64
all right okay

571.839 --> 576.5600000000001
that's an experiment is it

574.64 --> 578.64
not really

576.56 --> 580.56
thought that didn't make any sense it's

578.64 --> 582.3199999999999
more like a test

580.56 --> 584.2399999999999
it's not an experiment

582.32 --> 585.7600000000001
you're not establishing the cause of an

584.24 --> 588.72
effect

585.76 --> 591.72
you're establishing a what is concerning

588.72 --> 591.72
geometry

602.88 --> 606.32
a psych bear could see you

613.04 --> 616.04
so

618.56 --> 625.56
any reflections on yesterday's show or

620.8 --> 625.56
did you forget all about it already

639.76 --> 647.16
brian mullen did that experiment yeah i

642.56 --> 647.16
think so so you can start water

685.76 --> 690.959
right so yeah daniel robles

689.279 --> 694.24
i mean

690.959 --> 695.5999999999999
you that toe the line test could be like

694.24 --> 698.88
a

695.6 --> 700.5600000000001
a sort of a funny side thing you can do

698.88 --> 703.04
with a group

700.56 --> 705.68
like say on a flat earth convention or

703.04 --> 705.68
something right

706.72 --> 710.8000000000001
i mean it's like it almost could be like

708.72 --> 711.6
a flat earth event like oh let's toe a

710.8 --> 715.04
line

711.6 --> 717.279
over the huge distance

715.04 --> 719.279
and then see how incredibly flat it

717.279 --> 722.56
really is

719.279 --> 724.56
i mean that could be sort of fun

722.56 --> 726.88
but you're not really gonna prove

724.56 --> 728.8
anything with it or not scientifically

726.88 --> 732.399
anyway

728.8 --> 732.399
hello damn patriots

737.2 --> 743.44
ah gadge inspector eating

740.8 --> 745.5999999999999
mushroom pasta

743.44 --> 748.24
cool

745.6 --> 748.24
enjoy that

752.72 --> 759.6
is gravity dielectric acceleration

757.2 --> 762.0
or the what

759.6 --> 766.6800000000001
that's not a properly

762.0 --> 766.68
formulated question daniel robles

777.519 --> 780.079
gravity isn't

779.04 --> 783.1999999999999
a thing

780.079 --> 783.1999999999999
gravity is a concept

784.88 --> 793.4399999999999
dielectric acceleration is not gravity

789.76 --> 795.92
and relative density this equilibrium

793.44 --> 799.24
is not gravity either because gravity

795.92 --> 799.24
doesn't exist

805.04 --> 808.36
hey gordzilla

813.75 --> 818.65
[Music]

821.839 --> 825.0
all right

832.079 --> 836.6389999999999
oh yeah hello by the way seeking star

834.24 --> 839.639
wars of course

836.639 --> 839.639
uh

854.56 --> 859.3599999999999
these magpie kids are such whiners

858.32 --> 862.0
like

859.36 --> 863.92
that's pretty much a fully grown magpie

862.0 --> 866.56
and they're still whining like a little

863.92 --> 868.88
baby constantly constantly like

866.56 --> 871.04
literally stalking their own parents

868.88 --> 873.92
nagging them like feed me feed me like

871.04 --> 873.92
i'm a little birdie

874.0 --> 877.279
it just never stops

882.8 --> 886.16
like they're getting so hard on the

884.8 --> 887.92
nerves of their parents it's

886.16 --> 889.519
unbelievable but the parents are just

887.92 --> 891.8389999999999
cocking

889.519 --> 894.33
just

891.839 --> 897.5290000000001
just cocky

894.33 --> 897.529
[Music]

899.199 --> 903.199
it's very typical magpie by the way

903.44 --> 908.7600000000001
i don't see like jack daws doing any of

905.76 --> 908.76
that

920.639 --> 923.639
um

939.6 --> 943.759
hope model is a well-taught model

944.72 --> 948.399
right

946.0 --> 950.24
it's true though

948.399 --> 952.079
right it doesn't make sense but it

950.24 --> 954.16
doesn't need to make sense it's not

952.079 --> 956.6389999999999
about it making sense it's about you

954.16 --> 956.639
knowing

957.36 --> 962.8000000000001
the story

959.92 --> 965.199
it's like in an odd way the globe

962.8 --> 968.199
religion is actually just a storytelling

965.199 --> 968.199
tradition

968.56 --> 974.0
but this storytelling tradition is to be

971.44 --> 978.519
believed to be real

974.0 --> 978.519
which kind of makes it like a cult

990.639 --> 993.639
hmm

1021.279 --> 1024.279
uh

1025.52 --> 1031.76
oh i just saw a ufo he's just saying it

1030.48 --> 1033.3600000000001
inscribed

1031.76 --> 1035.039
what

1033.36 --> 1038.9189999999999
i've been seeing a couple of weird

1035.039 --> 1038.919
things too by the way

1039.039 --> 1042.319
like i but

1040.319 --> 1044.72
it's not really remarkable but i've see

1042.319 --> 1048.24
it been seeing like weird shadows in the

1044.72 --> 1051.76
corners of my eyes and [ __ ]

1048.24 --> 1054.0
i like there might be like a thing here

1051.76 --> 1055.36
and then sometimes like is that a mouse

1054.0 --> 1057.039
or something because there's also a

1055.36 --> 1059.9189999999999
mouse in the house

1057.039 --> 1059.919
unfortunately

1061.679 --> 1065.2800000000002
although

1062.799 --> 1066.96
yeah it's not a really big problem yeah

1065.28 --> 1070.08
and it does

1066.96 --> 1074.559
i do lay out mouse poison

1070.08 --> 1074.559
and they do eventually like take it

1076.48 --> 1079.039
but

1077.36 --> 1081.1999999999998
sometimes i think like there's like a

1079.039 --> 1082.4
shadow cat

1081.2 --> 1085.44
or something

1082.4 --> 1087.039
in the house because i'm like just going

1085.44 --> 1088.48
i don't know going to the bathroom or

1087.039 --> 1091.2
getting something from the kitchen and

1088.48 --> 1094.96
then it's like what

1091.2 --> 1096.799
there's like a roughly a a cat-sized

1094.96 --> 1098.64
sort of a black

1096.799 --> 1100.6399999999999
thing somewhere

1098.64 --> 1102.7990000000002
in the corner of my eye and then it just

1100.64 --> 1105.039
like jumps away through the wall or

1102.799 --> 1108.08
something it's really weird

1105.039 --> 1110.799
and i've seen it a couple of times

1108.08 --> 1113.52
like in the last

1110.799 --> 1113.52
four days

1114.0 --> 1117.84
it's just weird i mean it's not the

1115.76 --> 1119.76
first time ever that i've had that sort

1117.84 --> 1122.0
of experience but it

1119.76 --> 1124.4
it usually it does not happen all the

1122.0 --> 1126.4
time then it happens in a very short

1124.4 --> 1130.5590000000002
period it's like this weird thing going

1126.4 --> 1130.5590000000002
on and then it kind of goes away again

1131.52 --> 1135.72
very odd

1132.72 --> 1135.72
anyway

1135.9 --> 1139.0990000000002
[Music]

1148.84 --> 1155.24
uh anyway apparently elijah saw a ufo

1168.799 --> 1176.28
gravity still exists conceptually

1173.28 --> 1176.28
well

1178.24 --> 1183.44
that is kind of contradictory existing

1182.0 --> 1185.6
and concept

1183.44 --> 1189.039
right

1185.6 --> 1191.12
it exists as a concept

1189.039 --> 1192.96
or you could just say it's conceptual

1191.12 --> 1196.9599999999998
because existing

1192.96 --> 1198.24
kind of tends to emphasize

1196.96 --> 1201.44
a more

1198.24 --> 1201.44
tangible nature

1202.88 --> 1208.96
so exactly nothing exists conceptually

1205.84 --> 1213.12
right it's it's a it's a trick

1208.96 --> 1213.1200000000001
use of the words it's not correct

1213.44 --> 1217.3600000000001
right

1214.96 --> 1219.039
existing conceptually means it's

1217.36 --> 1222.4799999999998
conceptual

1219.039 --> 1226.1589999999999
existing kind of emphasizes the opposite

1222.48 --> 1226.159
so it's a mismatch of words

1229.84 --> 1235.6789999999999
i mean i would use it as ballwin as an

1232.48 --> 1235.679
excuse like to

1236.0 --> 1240.0
to kind of slip out of the argument but

1238.08 --> 1243.0
it doesn't actually make it a good

1240.0 --> 1243.0
argument

1248.4 --> 1255.1200000000001
he does understand gravity isn't

1251.76 --> 1255.12
its own thing right

1260.559 --> 1266.32
oh

1261.44 --> 1266.3200000000002
oh what what happens when you ask people

1266.64 --> 1271.3600000000001
what they think gravity is well if

1269.36 --> 1274.0
you're just gonna ask some random person

1271.36 --> 1274.0
on the street

1274.64 --> 1277.76
then

1275.52 --> 1280.32
they're just gonna fall back on their

1277.76 --> 1283.44
basic conditioning or association so

1280.32 --> 1285.6789999999999
like something falling down whatever

1283.44 --> 1285.679
like

1285.84 --> 1290.9599999999998
it's not a common

1288.84 --> 1292.559
understanding right

1290.96 --> 1296.32
about physics

1292.559 --> 1300.52
like that isn't even really common

1296.32 --> 1300.52
it should be but it isn't anymore

1305.84 --> 1310.0
colloquially

1307.76 --> 1310.0
right

1310.24 --> 1316.0
i mean people have a a colloquial idea

1313.2 --> 1317.679
of what gravity is supposed to be

1316.0 --> 1319.84
that doesn't mean that they actually get

1317.679 --> 1319.8400000000001
it

1321.36 --> 1326.7199999999998
because

1322.32 --> 1329.9189999999999
truly getting gravity is like not part

1326.72 --> 1329.919
of the curriculum

1330.0 --> 1335.76
you just get to learn the concepts

1333.2 --> 1336.64
and at the end you're not told like oh

1335.76 --> 1339.36
yeah

1336.64 --> 1342.4
all of it is actually fake

1339.36 --> 1344.559
right you don't get tested on is gravity

1342.4 --> 1346.5590000000002
actually real or just a concept you

1344.559 --> 1348.96
don't get that on your exam

1346.559 --> 1348.96
you see

1349.76 --> 1353.84
so

1351.2 --> 1353.8400000000001
people just

1354.0 --> 1357.679
don't yeah they get to learn the

1355.6 --> 1359.9189999999999
concepts and then they don't really get

1357.679 --> 1361.919
to understand and then they yeah over

1359.919 --> 1363.919
time it kind of just

1361.919 --> 1365.76
sinks in and they make up their mind

1363.919 --> 1368.64
what they think it is

1365.76 --> 1371.12
and that's it it's it's just like a

1368.64 --> 1371.1200000000001
a guess

1372.559 --> 1376.3999999999999
a non-studied guess

1374.48 --> 1378.72
that most people will have because of

1376.4 --> 1382.6000000000001
the way

1378.72 --> 1382.6000000000001
they are taught about it

1392.88 --> 1396.159
mass attracts mess

1397.44 --> 1403.039
yeah a lot of people still say that it

1399.36 --> 1404.24
is such a fraud though i mean in my

1403.039 --> 1407.84
school

1404.24 --> 1410.0
i got a supposed demonstration once

1407.84 --> 1411.6
with the clear

1410.0 --> 1414.72
reset

1411.6 --> 1416.48
machination that i i was not allowed to

1414.72 --> 1417.6000000000001
even touch

1416.48 --> 1419.84
so it's like

1417.6 --> 1421.279
not a cavendish like setup something

1419.84 --> 1423.279
else

1421.279 --> 1425.52
and i couldn't even like

1423.279 --> 1427.44
try to falsify what was there it's just

1425.52 --> 1428.96
like no you just got to believe that

1427.44 --> 1430.799
mass is attracting mass look at my

1428.96 --> 1433.279
little magician trick and i'm like what

1430.799 --> 1435.9189999999999
the [ __ ] is this

1433.279 --> 1439.2
like that's not scientific i'm supposed

1435.919 --> 1442.5590000000002
to be able to [ __ ] around with it

1439.2 --> 1444.64
and then it's still holding up

1442.559 --> 1446.72
right to test if there's no

1444.64 --> 1448.7990000000002
trixies going on if there's no freaking

1446.72 --> 1451.44
magnets going on we watch which was what

1448.799 --> 1452.24
my instant suspicion was since there was

1451.44 --> 1453.919
just

1452.24 --> 1456.24
that machination

1453.919 --> 1458.0
it was metal involved so it just

1456.24 --> 1462.039
immediately seemed like oh they're

1458.0 --> 1462.039
they're just using a magnet

1466.13 --> 1469.3190000000002
[Music]

1486.159 --> 1489.64
low wheel brakes

1492.67 --> 1504.809
[Music]

1506.48 --> 1510.279
hello kumo virus

1515.98 --> 1519.119
[Music]

1532.88 --> 1536.0590000000002
[Music]

1551.279 --> 1555.279
but yeah will brax look

1553.6 --> 1556.799
so maybe you see how many zombies are

1555.279 --> 1559.52
around

1556.799 --> 1562.08
well zombies about what right it's just

1559.52 --> 1564.559
that people get the feeling like oh

1562.08 --> 1566.32
there's so much knowledge in the world

1564.559 --> 1568.32
i don't need to know it somebody else

1566.32 --> 1572.0
will

1568.32 --> 1573.6
but then they don't actually go and find

1572.0 --> 1576.08
out

1573.6 --> 1579.9189999999999
they just assume it has to be out there

1576.08 --> 1581.12
and they don't actually take it

1579.919 --> 1583.76
i mean

1581.12 --> 1586.4799999999998
i am not like oh i have to learn

1583.76 --> 1588.8799999999999
everything i need all the books and read

1586.48 --> 1591.44
it all myself

1588.88 --> 1593.44
i'm very reliant partially because of my

1591.44 --> 1594.88
empathy skills on other people's

1593.44 --> 1598.799
knowledge

1594.88 --> 1600.4
but i do actually seek out other people

1598.799 --> 1602.32
with knowledge

1600.4 --> 1604.159
try to figure out like what do they know

1602.32 --> 1606.96
not even i don't necessarily need to

1604.159 --> 1609.679
like communicate

1606.96 --> 1612.559
sometimes other people doing stuff on

1609.679 --> 1615.679
video or whatever is like reading a book

1612.559 --> 1618.0
to me it is i am just reading them like

1615.679 --> 1619.919
a book figuring out

1618.0 --> 1621.279
like some people can do while reading

1619.919 --> 1624.0800000000002
books as to

1621.279 --> 1626.4
ooh this is the level of thinking and

1624.08 --> 1628.799
detail and background knowledge

1626.4 --> 1631.76
that that person has

1628.799 --> 1634.72
and then you just go through it

1631.76 --> 1637.84
and absorb some of it assimilate it

1634.72 --> 1637.84
i can do that with people

1638.48 --> 1643.919
but i do actually then seek it out i'm

1641.279 --> 1646.0
not like oh somebody out there should

1643.919 --> 1648.7990000000002
know this

1646.0 --> 1652.24
and then not actually have an example of

1648.799 --> 1654.559
who out there knows that

1652.24 --> 1657.2
right i'm not gonna be like oh well

1654.559 --> 1659.6
there's somebody out there that has to

1657.2 --> 1662.0800000000002
understand exactly like how

1659.6 --> 1663.36
the non-local holographic celestials

1662.08 --> 1664.24
work

1663.36 --> 1666.8799999999999
or

1664.24 --> 1668.48
how many potential other realm segments

1666.88 --> 1671.44
there are out there

1668.48 --> 1673.1200000000001
because i'm damn well sure nobody does

1671.44 --> 1676.559
actually know that

1673.12 --> 1676.559
out there not even close

1680.48 --> 1684.32
although the idea would be like oh such

1682.64 --> 1685.919
a relief that at least somebody else

1684.32 --> 1688.799
knows but

1685.919 --> 1692.0
yeah i'm pretty sure they don't

1688.799 --> 1692.0
pretty sure that i'm it

1695.2 --> 1700.3990000000001
except maybe for some sporadic

1699.12 --> 1703.039
research

1700.399 --> 1706.2399999999998
in a moment of interest among very smart

1703.039 --> 1706.24
people throughout history

1707.36 --> 1711.279
but just nothing more than just a moment

1709.76 --> 1714.0
of interest like

1711.279 --> 1715.679
maybe it's holographic or

1714.0 --> 1717.6
it does it or it's like

1715.679 --> 1720.24
yeah that's how all these weird ideas of

1717.6 --> 1721.12
like oh the sun must be a ball of plasma

1720.24 --> 1723.679
then

1721.12 --> 1725.6
right that's like a kickstart moment of

1723.679 --> 1728.88
like realizing hey there's something

1725.6 --> 1731.76
really weird about that thing

1728.88 --> 1734.0800000000002
it just never seemed to get far it's

1731.76 --> 1737.76
like come on man

1734.08 --> 1739.6
is it really so complicated to just say

1737.76 --> 1742.08
oh it's actually just a non-local

1739.6 --> 1744.559
hologram and there's light arriving

1742.08 --> 1747.6789999999999
and it has an angular consistency and

1744.559 --> 1750.76
you can't approach it it moves with you

1747.679 --> 1753.6000000000001
i mean is that so

1750.76 --> 1757.76
unbelievably mind-boggling

1753.6 --> 1760.799
to figure out and like explain is it so

1757.76 --> 1763.6
hard that i'm truly the first person in

1760.799 --> 1769.24
the freaking world to do that

1763.6 --> 1769.24
i can't believe it i can't believe it

1782.799 --> 1787.6
the crowd yeah but i'm not i'm not dude

1785.2 --> 1790.3990000000001
i'm not even looking for the crowd right

1787.6 --> 1792.1589999999999
the crowd oh you could hit a wider crowd

1790.399 --> 1795.1999999999998
you could have millions and yeah

1792.159 --> 1798.88
millions of idiots that just want to be

1795.2 --> 1798.88
fed like magpie baby

1800.48 --> 1806.88
yeah no thanks i don't need that

1803.84 --> 1808.399
i need actual thinkers

1806.88 --> 1812.24
people that

1808.399 --> 1815.59
have room for development on things that

1812.24 --> 1818.32
not everybody thinks about

1815.59 --> 1822.12
[Music]

1818.32 --> 1822.12
yeah level two indeed

1845.26 --> 1851.829
[Music]

1875.039 --> 1879.44
this time when all the world's asleep

1877.12 --> 1881.039
yeah man and it's surreal in ways

1879.44 --> 1883.519
because

1881.039 --> 1887.039
there are like groups that are really

1883.519 --> 1890.08
making an effort to really wake up

1887.039 --> 1892.32
in a very specific way

1890.08 --> 1894.08
but and they're like actually waking up

1892.32 --> 1895.36
but they're just waking up with eye

1894.08 --> 1897.84
flaps on

1895.36 --> 1899.9189999999999
so they can only see that one thing that

1897.84 --> 1902.24
they're waking up for

1899.919 --> 1905.6000000000001
right

1902.24 --> 1907.919
and it's so weird

1905.6 --> 1910.1589999999999
to see like how they are

1907.919 --> 1912.0
actually seeing everything else out

1910.159 --> 1914.0800000000002
there still but just

1912.0 --> 1917.96
in fear

1914.08 --> 1917.96
and and bafflement

1924.24 --> 1928.32
like you think you're awakening about

1926.72 --> 1930.799
something you're getting all excited

1928.32 --> 1935.24
because it's all new and

1930.799 --> 1935.24
you figured out something deep

1935.679 --> 1940.3200000000002
well

1937.2 --> 1943.519
you ain't seen nothing yet

1940.32 --> 1943.519
it's just the beginning

1943.679 --> 1949.159
there's a very very long way to go

1959.279 --> 1963.919
lockdown shows us how many people are

1961.36 --> 1966.6399999999999
asleep dude they're gonna like re-roll

1963.919 --> 1967.76
out another covet lockdown garbage

1966.64 --> 1969.76
nonsense

1967.76 --> 1972.24
they're they're gonna do it again

1969.76 --> 1972.24
soon

1974.72 --> 1978.24
i mean

1976.559 --> 1980.24
even like air in the netherlands they're

1978.24 --> 1981.84
just they're they're trying to roll it

1980.24 --> 1984.799
out again they're just like trying to

1981.84 --> 1986.48
say like oh there's a new cove in danger

1984.799 --> 1989.36
again no

1986.48 --> 1990.3990000000001
we gotta prepare we know what to do now

1989.36 --> 1992.32
right

1990.399 --> 1996.2399999999998
blah blah blah the distance the masks

1992.32 --> 1998.559
the lock oh yeah we know how to dude

1996.24 --> 2001.279
we've been endlessly battling you to

1998.559 --> 2004.0
tell you how incredibly inept and

2001.279 --> 2006.399
pointless all of those measures are for

2004.0 --> 2008.159
something that hasn't even been proven

2006.399 --> 2010.1589999999999
to exist

2008.159 --> 2012.3990000000001
based on a theory

2010.159 --> 2015.1200000000001
of the medical establishment that hasn't

2012.399 --> 2017.039
been proven at all

2015.12 --> 2019.039
and you're gonna tell us oh we just

2017.039 --> 2021.919
we're just gonna do the same thing again

2019.039 --> 2026.72
it's we're gonna defeat this go [ __ ]

2021.919 --> 2030.0800000000002
yourself you [ __ ] demonic freaks

2026.72 --> 2030.08
get out of our faces

2030.72 --> 2036.96
shove your measures up your ass and

2033.519 --> 2036.96
leave us the [ __ ] alone

2044.88 --> 2050.32
there will do you don't yeah but they're

2046.559 --> 2050.32
just gonna try to force it anyway

2052.399 --> 2056.56
they're just gonna try to thug it

2054.0 --> 2059.119
through it's like oh oh oh there is no

2056.56 --> 2061.52
more legitimate background story that

2059.119 --> 2064.079
makes sense for our measures well you

2061.52 --> 2065.919
you gotta do it anyway because it's not

2064.079 --> 2069.44
about whether it makes sense anymore

2065.919 --> 2073.6389999999997
it's about you obeying whatever the [ __ ]

2069.44 --> 2073.639
we say you have to do

2076.239 --> 2080.079
[Music]

2078.72 --> 2082.399
right

2080.079 --> 2084.8
that's the time

2082.399 --> 2087.359
where you have to go after the shock

2084.8 --> 2089.28
troops after the enforcers the blind

2087.359 --> 2091.52
enforce their forces that are just gonna

2089.28 --> 2095.44
enforce whatever

2091.52 --> 2097.44
the boss with the money says

2095.44 --> 2099.599
because if you get those

2097.44 --> 2101.839
completely out of the way

2099.599 --> 2104.4
then they have absolutely nowhere else

2101.839 --> 2106.64
left to go

2104.4 --> 2109.76
and they can just blabber on like a

2106.64 --> 2109.7599999999998
magpie baby

2110.079 --> 2114.079
all day long but

2111.599 --> 2115.52
nobody's gonna do it right nobody's

2114.079 --> 2118.8
gonna force you

2115.52 --> 2121.04
to feed that freaking magpie baby

2118.8 --> 2124.52
it's just gonna be whining and you could

2121.04 --> 2124.52
just fly away

2131.599 --> 2135.2000000000003
it was like

2133.52 --> 2138.16
no

2135.2 --> 2142.7599999999998
none of that is a thing

2138.16 --> 2142.7599999999998
it's not viruses don't exist

2144.56 --> 2149.359
it's just a condition it's just well the

2147.44 --> 2153.119
flu a cold

2149.359 --> 2155.839
little bodily clean up the micro level

2153.119 --> 2160.48
and all this science

2155.839 --> 2164.0789999999997
about it is all larping futurist garbage

2160.48 --> 2167.839
nonsense it's all [ __ ] nothing about

2164.079 --> 2170.7200000000003
it works every constituent part

2167.839 --> 2173.839
is even admitted by their designers that

2170.72 --> 2176.16
it doesn't make any [ __ ] sense

2173.839 --> 2178.64
okay

2176.16 --> 2181.5989999999997
none of it makes sense none of it is

2178.64 --> 2183.52
useful even by the people that have

2181.599 --> 2184.88
contributed

2183.52 --> 2189.92
to it

2184.88 --> 2189.92
even they say this is all [ __ ]

2192.0 --> 2195.68
yeah space busters you should you shared

2194.0 --> 2198.64
the space but it's good

2195.68 --> 2201.359
it's a really great one isn't it

2198.64 --> 2204.56
guys vector

2201.359 --> 2207.119
i mean spread it far and wide dude

2204.56 --> 2209.119
spread it far it's a really good video

2207.119 --> 2210.56
it's it's one of the videos that's like

2209.119 --> 2212.96
almost worth

2210.56 --> 2216.48
downloading and burning on a

2212.96 --> 2219.04
on a dvd or in a cd or something

2216.48 --> 2220.48
because it is

2219.04 --> 2223.96
it's a good one

2220.48 --> 2223.96
just that video

2235.839 --> 2240.24
yeah good to hear gadget inspector it is

2238.079 --> 2242.2400000000002
really astounding and there's probably

2240.24 --> 2243.9199999999996
layers in there that are shocking you

2242.24 --> 2245.4399999999996
like what what

2243.92 --> 2247.76
what what

2245.44 --> 2250.48
it did with me even though i've already

2247.76 --> 2251.5200000000004
been very deeply into it for a while he

2250.48 --> 2254.0
was like

2251.52 --> 2259.119
putting so much examples together and

2254.0 --> 2261.44
pictures and data readouts like whoa

2259.119 --> 2264.44
there's a lot of information in that

2261.44 --> 2264.44
video

2280.72 --> 2284.8799999999997
oh no

2281.92 --> 2286.88
somebody got sick one time oh and so

2284.88 --> 2288.4
special you couldn't even get out of bed

2286.88 --> 2289.76
yeah that's called just being really

2288.4 --> 2293.04
sick

2289.76 --> 2296.4
nothing to do with a virus

2293.04 --> 2299.839
or even bacteria infections or anything

2296.4 --> 2299.839
it's all just bodily

2299.92 --> 2302.92
maintenance

2315.2 --> 2318.359
i know

2327.119 --> 2330.32
dude you mentioned oh it's not a

2329.04 --> 2334.64
competition

2330.32 --> 2334.6400000000003
so i'm going to assume that it is

2338.16 --> 2344.0789999999997
right it's just like oh

2341.04 --> 2347.359
don't think i'm gay for saying this but

2344.079 --> 2350.079
then i'm gonna think you're gay

2347.359 --> 2352.4
because apparently yeah

2350.079 --> 2355.8390000000004
it's necessary for you to say that then

2352.4 --> 2355.839
apparently that's an issue

2356.32 --> 2359.04
hey elijah

2362.84 --> 2366.0190000000002
[Music]

2366.839 --> 2372.24
yeah man like the whole

2369.76 --> 2374.0
abortion stuff in america i i've barely

2372.24 --> 2376.4799999999996
brought it up because it is driving me

2374.0 --> 2378.64
nuts everybody there's people like going

2376.48 --> 2382.4
like really

2378.64 --> 2385.04
out of their mind insane over this

2382.4 --> 2387.28
and i don't really want to it's it's not

2385.04 --> 2389.68
funny to me right it's not like oh

2387.28 --> 2393.44
hahaha look at these demons go

2389.68 --> 2394.839
completely no it is dark it is creepy

2393.44 --> 2398.16
it is more

2394.839 --> 2400.4
worrisome that it's gotten to this part

2398.16 --> 2402.8799999999997
and everybody like that you're

2400.4 --> 2407.2000000000003
going to amuse yourself by people that

2402.88 --> 2407.2000000000003
have gone completely demonically insane

2407.28 --> 2411.76
instead of

2409.119 --> 2414.2400000000002
actually well perhaps

2411.76 --> 2416.4
changed the course of all things so that

2414.24 --> 2418.64
they wouldn't have become like this in

2416.4 --> 2421.52
the first place

2418.64 --> 2425.44
like all that behavior all that insanity

2421.52 --> 2427.839
all springs forth from negligence

2425.44 --> 2430.48
i'm quite confident

2427.839 --> 2433.359
that the primary factor that has turned

2430.48 --> 2436.48
these people into those people

2433.359 --> 2441.0
was negligence

2436.48 --> 2441.0
probably starting with their own parents

2464.72 --> 2471.319
sans what is that godzilla

2468.319 --> 2471.319
what

2490.8 --> 2494.04
it is

2495.359 --> 2500.119
is idiotic guards it like

2510.48 --> 2515.52
i i'd say at this point godzilla that

2512.8 --> 2517.119
the ones that came up with sudden adult

2515.52 --> 2519.68
death syndrome

2517.119 --> 2522.319
in the face of the obvious

2519.68 --> 2524.48
real cause of it all

2522.319 --> 2528.079
like they should be like made into an

2524.48 --> 2529.04
item and publicly shamed

2528.079 --> 2531.6800000000003
and

2529.04 --> 2533.44
perhaps go through like a public trial

2531.68 --> 2534.8799999999997
or something

2533.44 --> 2538.56
just to like

2534.88 --> 2542.0
how [ __ ] dare you like use a

2538.56 --> 2543.04
anti-human anti-national propaganda

2542.0 --> 2544.079
weapon

2543.04 --> 2547.52
to just

2544.079 --> 2551.6800000000003
mask for genocidal

2547.52 --> 2554.8
actions of like treacherous criminals

2551.68 --> 2557.9199999999996
how [ __ ] dare you even come up with

2554.8 --> 2557.92
that and publish that

2563.04 --> 2566.64
like those people should be the ones

2565.119 --> 2570.7200000000003
that came up with that they should be

2566.64 --> 2570.72
like traced gathered and just

2570.96 --> 2573.92
well arrested

2574.48 --> 2581.119
arrested sued put on a big trial and

2577.92 --> 2584.88
highlight exactly how unbelievably

2581.119 --> 2586.4
[ __ ] up it is what they did

2584.88 --> 2590.0
to make up

2586.4 --> 2592.96
student adult death syndrome

2590.0 --> 2594.16
very blatantly to cover

2592.96 --> 2596.76
for

2594.16 --> 2599.1189999999997
purposely designed

2596.76 --> 2601.76
extermination devices that we know as

2599.119 --> 2601.76
vaccines

2604.839 --> 2610.7999999999997
right i think that should be a thing

2607.839 --> 2612.0
but it should be like put on the main

2610.8 --> 2614.6400000000003
right not

2612.0 --> 2616.48
not people all you could make your own

2614.64 --> 2618.16
video about it that's all very cool

2616.48 --> 2621.8
right that's not gonna do it it has to

2618.16 --> 2621.7999999999997
be like really

2622.64 --> 2626.24
put in the public why why is that

2625.04 --> 2629.04
important

2626.24 --> 2631.2
because if they are allowed

2629.04 --> 2632.72
to lower the bar

2631.2 --> 2635.2
this far

2632.72 --> 2636.3999999999996
and normalize that

2635.2 --> 2640.0
then

2636.4 --> 2641.839
there is no end in sight you see

2640.0 --> 2644.319
doing what they've done calling it

2641.839 --> 2647.119
sudden adult death syndrome and claiming

2644.319 --> 2649.44
like this is a new thing

2647.119 --> 2652.48
that's beyond

2649.44 --> 2655.599
any science fiction writers

2652.48 --> 2658.2400000000002
dystopian science fiction writers

2655.599 --> 2660.56
scheme like no science fiction writer

2658.24 --> 2664.0789999999997
would make up that

2660.56 --> 2667.2799999999997
because it's too egregious

2664.079 --> 2668.8
yeah i've never seen anything to that

2667.28 --> 2671.8390000000004
level in like

2668.8 --> 2675.2000000000003
blake seven or which is very dystopian

2671.839 --> 2676.7999999999997
in ways or any other movie or

2675.2 --> 2680.96
series

2676.8 --> 2684.48
like they don't go that far it's too far

2680.96 --> 2684.48
it's it's too far

2684.96 --> 2689.52
no science fiction writer could come up

2687.2 --> 2691.4399999999996
with such a [ __ ] story as this and

2689.52 --> 2693.92
it needs to be punished because if you

2691.44 --> 2695.68
allow this to become normal without

2693.92 --> 2698.7200000000003
people to think that they can't get the

2695.68 --> 2700.8799999999997
demons that sit on this throne of

2698.72 --> 2703.359
garbage and feces

2700.88 --> 2705.359
if you allow them to normalize that

2703.359 --> 2708.0
it's just going to be non-stop

2705.359 --> 2708.0
nightmares

2708.64 --> 2715.7599999999998
and people are like

2711.68 --> 2718.72
this level of insanity on average causes

2715.76 --> 2721.28
suicide to skyrocket

2718.72 --> 2723.5989999999997
harder you press this sort of level of

2721.28 --> 2725.2000000000003
insanity the more people

2723.599 --> 2727.76
out there

2725.2 --> 2730.7999999999997
will kill themselves because it's too is

2727.76 --> 2731.6800000000003
becoming too much it's like it

2730.8 --> 2732.4
they're

2731.68 --> 2734.48
not

2732.4 --> 2737.359
super intellectual they're not like

2734.48 --> 2738.56
natural psychologists and they will just

2737.359 --> 2740.96
like

2738.56 --> 2743.359
i can't do this anymore

2740.96 --> 2745.44
yeah that's what's gonna happen

2743.359 --> 2747.7599999999998
if you allow this [ __ ]

2745.44 --> 2750.88
to continue

2747.76 --> 2754.0
suicides will increase because of the

2750.88 --> 2755.76
hardcore psychological warfare

2754.0 --> 2758.319
level

2755.76 --> 2760.88
if you allow certain adult death

2758.319 --> 2762.8
syndrome to become

2760.88 --> 2764.56
normal

2762.8 --> 2767.6800000000003
that they do that that level of

2764.56 --> 2769.52
propaganda if you allow that to be the

2767.68 --> 2773.5989999999997
new level

2769.52 --> 2773.599
suicides are going to skyrocket

2773.76 --> 2778.1600000000003
and they're already pretty bad at this

2775.839 --> 2778.16
point

2781.76 --> 2784.5600000000004
right

2782.56 --> 2787.04
i'm not even talking about vaccine

2784.56 --> 2789.359
people that are in trouble

2787.04 --> 2792.079
that have damage and that are like

2789.359 --> 2793.7599999999998
facing a harsh life now

2792.079 --> 2797.28
yeah they too

2793.76 --> 2798.8
but maybe not even that maybe

2797.28 --> 2801.2000000000003
you know

2798.8 --> 2802.96
what if a vaccine person was actually

2801.2 --> 2804.8799999999997
really beloved

2802.96 --> 2807.119
in their family and they didn't realize

2804.88 --> 2809.44
what was happening then

2807.119 --> 2811.6800000000003
what if they then die or or commit

2809.44 --> 2812.88
suicide because it's just not doable

2811.68 --> 2815.2799999999997
anymore

2812.88 --> 2818.079
well that's gonna [ __ ] up everybody they

2815.28 --> 2818.079
that loved them

2818.8 --> 2823.76
so

2820.0 --> 2826.72
let's not just let their [ __ ] demons

2823.76 --> 2828.88
roam free and go wherever they want just

2826.72 --> 2830.7999999999997
oh they'll only make it worse for

2828.88 --> 2834.1600000000003
themselves

2830.8 --> 2836.0
and everybody else

2834.16 --> 2838.7999999999997
yeah

2836.0 --> 2840.88
think you're so [ __ ] genius oh look

2838.8 --> 2842.8
at how crazy they are oh they're just

2840.88 --> 2844.48
making it worse for themselves huh this

2842.8 --> 2845.6800000000003
is so funny all we have to do is just

2844.48 --> 2848.16
stand here

2845.68 --> 2851.52
and take note and report on how crazy

2848.16 --> 2855.1189999999997
they are oh we're so brilliant yes yes

2851.52 --> 2857.04
but that passivity

2855.119 --> 2859.839
also causes

2857.04 --> 2862.0
everybody else to be burdened more by

2859.839 --> 2863.7599999999998
the same level of insanity you see those

2862.0 --> 2864.8
people that are insane and that are

2863.76 --> 2867.2000000000003
doing it

2864.8 --> 2869.8390000000004
they're actually kind of getting used to

2867.2 --> 2873.1189999999997
dealing with it and surviving under high

2869.839 --> 2876.88
levels of insanity pressure

2873.119 --> 2876.88
because they're constantly doing it

2877.359 --> 2879.68
so

2878.64 --> 2881.44
yeah

2879.68 --> 2883.52
long-term consequences is that

2881.44 --> 2885.44
everybody's [ __ ]

2883.52 --> 2886.88
you're just gonna stand there and watch

2885.44 --> 2890.4
oh they're just going to destroy

2886.88 --> 2892.6400000000003
themselves yes and everybody else with

2890.4 --> 2892.64
them

2894.319 --> 2900.24
potentially including you

2897.04 --> 2902.319
even though you know what's going on you

2900.24 --> 2905.5989999999997
know how to stay out of it

2902.319 --> 2908.319
oh you think that now you've won

2905.599 --> 2911.44
you've won now because you understand it

2908.319 --> 2913.2799999999997
and you stayed at oh no no because

2911.44 --> 2915.28
you're still

2913.28 --> 2919.28
living with other people other people

2915.28 --> 2922.079
are going to get influenced and if they

2919.28 --> 2924.48
take everybody with them

2922.079 --> 2926.8
then you're living in a world that is a

2924.48 --> 2929.839
giant scar

2926.8 --> 2929.8390000000004
of what they did

2950.72 --> 2956.68

uh

3328.16 --> 3331.48
let's see

3346.64 --> 3350.64
right the new lockdowns and all that

3348.88 --> 3353.04
[ __ ] that they're trying to unleash on

3350.64 --> 3355.359

[Music]

3359.599 --> 3363.2000000000003
they are trying

3361.2 --> 3365.52
but people are

3363.2 --> 3367.5989999999997
quite fed up with it in the netherlands

3365.52 --> 3370.319
at least it seems like i still keep

3367.599 --> 3372.799
looking around in

3370.319 --> 3375.359
alternative news sections and in general

3372.799 --> 3377.52
oh by the way when i was out

3375.359 --> 3379.44
shopping today

3377.52 --> 3382.16
like there was

3379.44 --> 3385.68
some guy talking to another guy that i

3382.16 --> 3385.68
know from the neighborhood

3386.64 --> 3391.7599999999998
it was kind of a numpty

3389.28 --> 3393.28
numpty in a wheelchair

3391.76 --> 3396.3190000000004
really numpty

3393.28 --> 3399.599
like he still thinks that

3396.319 --> 3401.359
uh still thinks that like leftism is

3399.599 --> 3403.599
cool and all that

3401.359 --> 3406.799
sort of it's weird

3403.599 --> 3408.559
i don't know what the hell he's thinking

3406.799 --> 3410.4
but there was another guy that didn't

3408.559 --> 3412.88
know and he was like talking about

3410.4 --> 3415.04
bilderberg and like how

3412.88 --> 3417.359
he was basically going to like old left

3415.04 --> 3419.68
right paradigms like oh communism and

3417.359 --> 3421.839
fascism it is basically the same thing

3419.68 --> 3421.839
and

3422.4 --> 3426.48
he was really he was trying to like lift

3424.799 --> 3427.68
this guy up

3426.48 --> 3429.92
out of his

3427.68 --> 3431.5989999999997
mentally degenerated state which just

3429.92 --> 3433.839
doesn't work i've tried it before i've

3431.599 --> 3435.839
even tried it harshly

3433.839 --> 3438.16
like with an attitude kind of similar as

3435.839 --> 3440.88
to what i do here because he is like

3438.16 --> 3444.0789999999997
really [ __ ] [ __ ]

3440.88 --> 3445.28
like 70 iq or something like he's really

3444.079 --> 3447.6800000000003
[ __ ] dumb

3445.28 --> 3449.599
he has a big mouth

3447.68 --> 3450.96
so you have to get like really strict

3449.599 --> 3453.6800000000003
with him and i just told him like no

3450.96 --> 3455.599
you're just wrong you're just wrong you

3453.68 --> 3458.0789999999997
assumed this it's based on something

3455.599 --> 3461.04
that you wanted as a kid you were wrong

3458.079 --> 3463.28
then you're wrong now you need to let it

3461.04 --> 3466.88
go

3463.28 --> 3470.7200000000003
and move on get real stop blabbering if

3466.88 --> 3470.7200000000003
you don't [ __ ] understand this world

3471.839 --> 3479.2799999999997
sharing information only helps others

3476.079 --> 3481.8390000000004
when you're actually up to date

3479.28 --> 3484.88
you gotta work on that not just keep

3481.839 --> 3489.16
repeating the same garbage over and over

3484.88 --> 3489.1600000000003
again for 40 years straight

3490.079 --> 3494.319
so

3491.44 --> 3496.079
that guy just not gonna get it ever

3494.319 --> 3498.0
because he just immediately forgets

3496.079 --> 3500.7200000000003
something as soon as he realizes how

3498.0 --> 3504.799
[ __ ] dumb he is

3500.72 --> 3504.799
but it's yeah it's typical

3506.0 --> 3509.04
but there's other people out there that

3507.44 --> 3511.04
just know like yeah bilderberg they're

3509.04 --> 3512.0
all demons and they're they just would

3511.04 --> 3514.72
have

3512.0 --> 3517.28
stuck everybody's blood and

3514.72 --> 3518.9599999999996
and destroy humanity and like oh

3517.28 --> 3521.8390000000004
huh

3518.96 --> 3523.92
well i guess i'm not the only one then

3521.839 --> 3525.68
that would say that of course i know i'm

3523.92 --> 3527.359
not the only one but to actually hear

3525.68 --> 3528.3999999999996
somebody else say that out loud it's

3527.359 --> 3529.92
pretty cool

3528.4 --> 3532.64
and i did kind of join into the

3529.92 --> 3532.64
conversation

3534.799 --> 3540.24
because there's still so many typical

3537.359 --> 3542.64
misconceptions in that sort of public

3540.24 --> 3544.4799999999996
speaking about those things

3542.64 --> 3546.4
i was going to jump in and basically be

3544.48 --> 3548.079
arwenian about it like uh

3546.4 --> 3551.28
no

3548.079 --> 3551.28
no you got that wrong

3553.2 --> 3557.64
but it didn't really last that long

3558.4 --> 3562.2400000000002
because

3559.599 --> 3564.2400000000002
the store was opening

3562.24 --> 3567.7599999999998
and i had was in a hurry because if i

3564.24 --> 3569.52
would have hung around even longer

3567.76 --> 3571.3590000000004
then i would even start in the sh i

3569.52 --> 3573.839
would have started the show even later

3571.359 --> 3573.839
so

3580.0 --> 3585.15
the derpcon alarm goes off

3583.52 --> 3588.329
right

3585.15 --> 3588.329
[Music]

3612.88 --> 3615.839
anyhow

3618.079 --> 3622.88
i got a new drink but i might be saving

3620.96 --> 3623.68
it for tomorrow there was like this

3622.88 --> 3626.319
thing

3623.68 --> 3626.319
in the store

3626.48 --> 3631.44
it was kind of expensive but it looks

3628.799 --> 3633.52
really interesting so i thought i gotta

3631.44 --> 3637.2000000000003
try this like once and at least it's a

3633.52 --> 3637.2
lot so it's this

3637.52 --> 3644.24
pretty big fancy bottle man

3641.04 --> 3646.64
it was like

3644.24 --> 3648.4799999999996
18 euros or something

3646.64 --> 3649.7599999999998
but it is like half a liter and it

3648.48 --> 3651.68
there's like

3649.76 --> 3653.2000000000003
it's organic root like

3651.68 --> 3655.2
elixir

3653.2 --> 3657.2
so

3655.2 --> 3660.16
and the list is like

3657.2 --> 3662.64
ashwagandha

3660.16 --> 3664.0789999999997
horseradish licorice

3662.64 --> 3666.24
kurkuma

3664.079 --> 3667.92
kalanka

3666.24 --> 3670.4799999999996
kalanga

3667.92 --> 3675.119
or is it galanga i don't know

3670.48 --> 3678.559
tapioca ginger carrot yacon and macca

3675.119 --> 3681.28
so this seemed really interesting to try

3678.559 --> 3681.28
out one time

3681.839 --> 3686.24
maybe i'll just have it just a tiny

3685.04 --> 3688.09
little sieve

3686.24 --> 3691.68
it's at the end of the show but

3688.09 --> 3695.119
[Music]

3691.68 --> 3696.839
oh we have a specially closed cap

3695.119 --> 3700.079
wow

3696.839 --> 3700.0789999999997
oh all right

3700.96 --> 3705.599
oh my god that smells delicious

3705.68 --> 3711.489
that sounds really good

3708.38 --> 3711.489
[Music]

3712.799 --> 3717.2
not safety but amount of ready what

3718.16 --> 3724.0389999999998
sounds spicy yeah probably i like that

3726.25 --> 3728.88
[Music]

3727.92 --> 3732.2400000000002
oh

3728.88 --> 3732.2400000000002
this is a concentrate

3733.92 --> 3739.0
you're supposed to mix it in with

3735.52 --> 3739.0
something else

3741.68 --> 3745.7599999999998
like with water or

3744.16 --> 3747.92
tea

3745.76 --> 3750.1600000000003
fizzy stuff okay

3747.92 --> 3751.76
so it's a cons good to know i didn't

3750.16 --> 3754.799
know that

3751.76 --> 3758.2400000000002
right but i'm gonna try it

3754.799 --> 3758.24
smells really intense

3760.88 --> 3767.559
so this is effectively a lemonade that

3762.96 --> 3767.559
makes a lot more sense with the price

3769.76 --> 3774.0
galanga is ginger hmm

3776.72 --> 3779.0389999999998
all right

3780.64 --> 3783.839
it looks beautiful

3790.72 --> 3793.0389999999998
wow

3793.52 --> 3799.599
whoa

3795.76 --> 3801.119

3831.599 --> 3836.7200000000003
that that was such a

3833.839 --> 3839.839
wide range of tastes

3836.72 --> 3842.8799999999997
it's like never even even tasted before

3839.839 --> 3842.88
that is incredible

3844.4 --> 3847.4
wow

3853.039 --> 3857.5200000000004

3871.92 --> 3877.4

3889.68 --> 3894.54

4005.599 --> 4008.88
but

4006.72 --> 4010.64
i'm gonna try that even like tomorrow on

4008.88 --> 4012.559
tomorrow's show

4010.64 --> 4014.799
start out with it just to see like if

4012.559 --> 4017.2000000000003
that actually just changes the way i

4014.799 --> 4017.2
function

4018.0 --> 4023.039
it does really kind of like wake you up

4020.72 --> 4027.72

nathan's late again

4106.239 --> 4109.04
premiering

4115.359 --> 4119.839

4117.04 --> 4119.839
live show today

4120.25 --> 4129.21

4139.199 --> 4142.879999999999

4141.04 --> 4147.239
debates today live

4142.88 --> 4147.2390000000005
which is important and fortunate

4158.96 --> 4163.759
uh yes hey thank you divergent droid for

4161.44 --> 4167.199
that extra input but yeah that is that

4163.759 --> 4169.679
is basically what it it is

4167.199 --> 4173.719
and it really does

4169.679 --> 4173.719
do that what it says

4174.0 --> 4179.839
common and the unusual familiar and the

4176.64 --> 4179.839
exotic it is

4182.08 --> 4187.6
and of course it's organic you think i'm

4184.239 --> 4189.839
gonna buy something that's not organic

4187.6 --> 4189.839
never

4200.56 --> 4206.0
south african

4202.64 --> 4206.0
no it's south america

4215.04 --> 4220.88
or maybe both

4217.92 --> 4222.08
south america right not south african i

4220.88 --> 4224.96
don't know

4222.08 --> 4224.96
i think you uh

4225.199 --> 4230.0
got that wrong i mean

4227.679 --> 4232.88
like inca

4230.0 --> 4234.48
and these types of symbols and style

4232.88 --> 4235.6
that's south

4234.48 --> 4238.07

4286.65 --> 4290.839999999999
[Music]

4299.44 --> 4305.199
right so if nathan is not going to do a

4301.679 --> 4305.1990000000005
live show i guess i could just

4305.52 --> 4309.84
stay

4307.679 --> 4313.47
and do the show a little longer since i

4309.84 --> 4316.899
started up so late

4313.47 --> 4316.899
[Music]

4320.159 --> 4323.159
hmm

4351.26 --> 4354.96
[Music]

4352.96 --> 4359.12
ah

4354.96 --> 4363.12
wow and and just a little little bit

4359.12 --> 4367.88
is i still feel it in my throat

4363.12 --> 4367.88
it's that drink makes quite an impact

4368.68 --> 4371.879
[Music]

4375.76 --> 4382.1990000000005
like this thing you're not gonna chug

4377.6 --> 4382.1990000000005
this bottle down i guarantee it

4386.96 --> 4392.8
hello x320 no

4389.44 --> 4395.36
i did show off a new drink

4392.8 --> 4398.52
and i had my illuminati croissant before

4395.36 --> 4398.5199999999995
the show

4402.56 --> 4405.1990000000005
i mean i i do

4404.159 --> 4408.08
i do

4405.199 --> 4412.759999999999
try to kind of avoid eating while the

4408.08 --> 4412.76
show is live because it is just messy

4413.52 --> 4419.290000000001
i mean drinking is no problem but eating

4416.239 --> 4420.799999999999
takes more time and makes noise

4419.29 --> 4421.37
[Music]

4420.8 --> 4424.5
so

4421.37 --> 4424.5
[Music]

4425.52 --> 4432.320000000001
but i will still promote food

4428.88 --> 4433.12
like this if i find something new or i

4432.32 --> 4434.239
i'm

4433.12 --> 4435.199
trying to

4434.239 --> 4438.919999999999
share

4435.199 --> 4438.919999999999
how i do things

4440.719 --> 4443.719
anyhow

4467.92 --> 4473.92
and then i have to go get a song

4471.52 --> 4473.92
all right

4475.199 --> 4479.36
i think i'm gonna round out the show

4476.719 --> 4483.52
anyway i was not like super energetic

4479.36 --> 4485.92
today i mean yesterday's show was really

4483.52 --> 4485.92
epic

4486.239 --> 4490.08
as in

4487.199 --> 4494.0
i'm really happy with

4490.08 --> 4494.0
the way that i put these ideas down

4494.8 --> 4499.04
and

4496.88 --> 4503.36
appealed to something that i've been

4499.04 --> 4503.36
basically doing well half my life

4504.08 --> 4507.76
and i always knew that i was going to do

4505.679 --> 4511.04
it for something and it's like and

4507.76 --> 4513.84
also about the prejudice right

4511.04 --> 4516.08
how that is such a strange word

4513.84 --> 4516.08
and

4516.239 --> 4521.199
how you can basically keep on doing

4518.719 --> 4522.4
things on just an impulse without the

4521.199 --> 4526.5599999999995
knowledge

4522.4 --> 4528.4
or like the the reason you could say

4526.56 --> 4529.84
the

4528.4 --> 4532.799999999999
the actual

4529.84 --> 4533.679
intellectual connections but still like

4532.8 --> 4536.400000000001
know

4533.679 --> 4538.719
something will happen

4536.4 --> 4539.679
in a way or something you have to do

4538.719 --> 4542.2390000000005
this

4539.679 --> 4544.4
right it's like you have to do this oh

4542.239 --> 4545.759999999999
really reason it out i don't know i just

4544.4 --> 4547.679
feel i have to do this and i'm not going

4545.76 --> 4550.56
to be dissuaded i'm going to get really

4547.679 --> 4552.719
defensive if you try to dissuade me

4550.56 --> 4553.52
that sounds like prejudice

4552.719 --> 4555.6
and

4553.52 --> 4557.52
a lot sometimes

4555.6 --> 4559.120000000001
or maybe even most of the times when

4557.52 --> 4561.52
it's like that and you have it under

4559.12 --> 4564.719
control

4561.52 --> 4566.8
it's actually to like protect or create

4564.719 --> 4569.44
something into the future that's really

4566.8 --> 4571.6
important and good

4569.44 --> 4573.44
so i think prejudice is a good thing and

4571.6 --> 4574.88
it is fascinating because it kind of

4573.44 --> 4577.599999999999
like even a

4574.88 --> 4580.88
prejudice could be linked to

4577.6 --> 4582.08
having foresight onto the future

4580.88 --> 4584.159000000001
without

4582.08 --> 4585.12
the reasoning

4584.159 --> 4587.04
without

4585.12 --> 4589.84
like actually

4587.04 --> 4591.44
being able to plan it and just lay it

4589.84 --> 4594.2390000000005
down like a map

4591.44 --> 4597.599999999999
but still knowing like knowing like you

4594.239 --> 4597.599999999999
have to do it like this

4597.92 --> 4601.679
it will work out on the long run

4604.239 --> 4608.159
it's all intuition driven and i think

4606.32 --> 4610.08
that it is very closely linked to

4608.159 --> 4611.92
prejudice

4610.08 --> 4614.4
the non-legal

4611.92 --> 4616.8
use of the word right so i'm just i'm

4614.4 --> 4618.639999999999
still reflecting back on yesterday's

4616.8 --> 4620.4800000000005
show it is still giving me energy

4618.64 --> 4621.4800000000005
thinking about i actually kind of wanted

4620.48 --> 4625.199
to like

4621.48 --> 4627.04
re-boot it today but it just it's not a

4625.199 --> 4629.919999999999
uh

4627.04 --> 4632.92
high energy day for me after yesterday

4629.92 --> 4632.92
was

4639.28 --> 4643.759999999999
but i want to get back to that i want to

4641.12 --> 4643.76
see if i can

4644.08 --> 4649.28
basically keep applying

4646.48 --> 4652.239
that formula

4649.28 --> 4654.4
and amaze everybody about oh this word

4652.239 --> 4656.159
that you've always thought

4654.4 --> 4660.08
means this because that's how everybody

4656.159 --> 4660.08
used that's how you assume

4660.4 --> 4666.08
it or anything about it and then like oh

4663.44 --> 4668.4
really oh so you have

4666.08 --> 4670.08
preconceived

4668.4 --> 4672.719
ideas about it

4670.08 --> 4676.239
let's test those preconceived ideas and

4672.719 --> 4679.84
see whether your ideas were contemporary

4676.239 --> 4679.839999999999
or actually fractal

4681.04 --> 4687.44
and you'll find that a lot of people get

4684.08 --> 4690.719
stuck upon the contemporary intuitive

4687.44 --> 4693.28
use of a word instead of the true power

4690.719 --> 4695.52
of the word which lies within its

4693.28 --> 4698.159
history and etymology

4695.52 --> 4700.4400000000005
and often reveals that it is actually

4698.159 --> 4703.28
being employed

4700.44 --> 4705.678999999999
contemporarily as a spell

4703.28 --> 4708.8
against those

4705.679 --> 4708.8
that use it

4709.84 --> 4715.4400000000005
and i really am kind of impressed by

4712.56 --> 4716.64
that clear oversight discovery you could

4715.44 --> 4717.36
see say

4716.64 --> 4718.2390000000005
i

4717.36 --> 4719.679
this

4718.239 --> 4722.718999999999
covered it

4719.679 --> 4725.36
it was there i'm not the one to create

4722.719 --> 4730.28
this i just discovered it i took the

4725.36 --> 4730.28
cover off look look at what has revealed

4739.76 --> 4745.320000000001
it can be unfair favor there's no such

4742.32 --> 4745.32
thing

4752.96 --> 4759.12
there's favoritism for good reasons and

4755.04 --> 4759.12
there's favoritism for bad reasons

4761.04 --> 4767.199
right if you favor somebody because you

4763.52 --> 4768.719
like them more or they make you feel

4767.199 --> 4771.599999999999
nice

4768.719 --> 4773.92
that's a pretty cheap reason

4771.6 --> 4776.64
if you favorite somebody because you

4773.92 --> 4778.8
know they have skill they have

4776.64 --> 4779.92
like sense of responsibility they're

4778.8 --> 4782.159000000001
very

4779.92 --> 4786.4
creative they're very

4782.159 --> 4790.96
motivated they have good traits then

4786.4 --> 4791.759999999999
favoritism is simply wise

4790.96 --> 4794.08
right

4791.76 --> 4796.719
so it is yeah

4794.08 --> 4797.679
see see how we do it in kumo virus every

4796.719 --> 4802.8
word

4797.679 --> 4806.159
every word every word every word every

4802.8 --> 4808.0
word every word you think

4806.159 --> 4810.08
means something

4808.0 --> 4813.44
in a collodi colloquial setting you

4810.08 --> 4815.04
could all just like oh look let's take

4813.44 --> 4817.28
this apart let's see what it really

4815.04 --> 4819.679
means oh wait

4817.28 --> 4822.04
the preconceived notion that is like

4819.679 --> 4824.159
very generally accepted about it is

4822.04 --> 4826.239
exactly wrong

4824.159 --> 4830.199
again

4826.239 --> 4830.199
isn't that just interesting

4833.04 --> 4836.4
favoritism without knowing the person

4834.56 --> 4838.719
would be prejudice

4836.4 --> 4841.36
yeah but you know the person the second

4838.719 --> 4841.36
you meet them

4841.679 --> 4846.2390000000005
depending on

4843.04 --> 4849.12
how well you can read people i do it's

4846.239 --> 4852.48
like i will have favorites immediately

4849.12 --> 4855.199
the second i lay my eyes on them

4852.48 --> 4858.4
the second because that's

4855.199 --> 4861.599999999999
the second i get a lot of structurally

4858.4 --> 4865.679
important info for sizing up somebody's

4861.6 --> 4865.679
character and ability and energy range

4866.32 --> 4868.5599999999995
right

4869.92 --> 4874.32
because by this

4871.84 --> 4878.2390000000005
favoritism without knowing the person so

4874.32 --> 4880.96
that means that you would pick somebody

4878.239 --> 4883.599999999999
without knowing without having seen them

4880.96 --> 4886.0
or knowing anything about them well then

4883.6 --> 4890.320000000001
how can you even favorite somebody if

4886.0 --> 4891.44
you have no information about them to

4890.32 --> 4895.239
pick

4891.44 --> 4895.239
that makes no sense

4903.12 --> 4906.5599999999995
judging in advance

4904.8 --> 4909.52
yeah

4906.56 --> 4909.52
but that's good

4910.4 --> 4914.839999999999
judging sizing up

4913.52 --> 4918.080000000001
acting

4914.84 --> 4921.360000000001
accordingly in advance

4918.08 --> 4921.36
sounds like a good thing

4921.6 --> 4928.84
i mean condemning in advance

4925.12 --> 4928.84
basically already

4930.4 --> 4935.599999999999
like if you don't give somebody a chance

4932.639 --> 4937.28
at all to even express themselves that

4935.6 --> 4940.8
would be

4937.28 --> 4940.8
stifling imprisonment

4941.04 --> 4944.719
but

4942.159 --> 4947.12
yeah to actually size somebody up and

4944.719 --> 4949.199
and like already know how you're gonna

4947.12 --> 4951.599999999999
handle it

4949.199 --> 4956.44
what's bad about that and it's not

4951.6 --> 4959.360000000001
stereotyping it's sizing somebody up

4956.44 --> 4962.4
stereotyping is when you don't size them

4959.36 --> 4964.32
up and you pick up a very cheap

4962.4 --> 4966.879999999999
superficial trait

4964.32 --> 4969.12
and then make that

4966.88 --> 4972.76
the characteristic

4969.12 --> 4972.76
that's stereotyping

4976.719 --> 4979.84
liking somebody just because they are

4978.4 --> 4981.04
christian

4979.84 --> 4983.12
well that's

4981.04 --> 4987.04
that well for a christian a lot of

4983.12 --> 4988.48
christians that's just prac pragmatism

4987.04 --> 4990.719
you like somebody because they're a

4988.48 --> 4993.12
christian well that's big probably

4990.719 --> 4995.92
because you know then

4993.12 --> 4998.96
that you can rely upon certain forms of

4995.92 --> 5000.56
communication to work out perfectly

4998.96 --> 5003.28
because with a christian you know kind

5000.56 --> 5005.04
of what to expect in certain ways

5003.28 --> 5007.5199999999995
you see

5005.04 --> 5008.639
you already know what the path of christ

5007.52 --> 5011.280000000001
is

5008.639 --> 5014.76
what typical christians will be facing

5011.28 --> 5014.759999999999
what their philosophical

5016.4 --> 5019.36
dwellings will be

5019.44 --> 5021.759999999999
right

5024.239 --> 5028.4
so yeah it's not gonna hold up a good

5026.08 --> 5031.44
you can keep on throwing out examples

5028.4 --> 5033.839999999999
i'm going to crack every single one

5031.44 --> 5037.36
every single one

5033.84 --> 5037.360000000001
prejudice is good

5038.8 --> 5043.84
the non-legal version of it that is

5045.76 --> 5051.679
prejudice is quick assessment is

5048.88 --> 5053.92
allowing your intuition

5051.679 --> 5057.159
to dominate

5053.92 --> 5057.159
your actions

5066.719 --> 5071.52
it's the same as judging a book by its

5068.4 --> 5073.28
cover oh that's so cute well i do judge

5071.52 --> 5075.6
a book by its cover

5073.28 --> 5079.28
and a lot of the time the cover reveals

5075.6 --> 5081.6
a lot about the book now doesn't it

5079.28 --> 5082.719
again

5081.6 --> 5085.1990000000005
i mean

5082.719 --> 5087.199
if you just look at a book's cover and

5085.199 --> 5088.799999999999
then you're going to be like oh that's

5087.199 --> 5092.159
just going to be terrible you don't open

5088.8 --> 5093.6
it up to confirm that

5092.159 --> 5096.719
right if you're going to be like oh this

5093.6 --> 5099.4400000000005
looks absolutely terrible

5096.719 --> 5101.6
from the cover terrible styled like all

5099.44 --> 5103.599999999999
disgusting

5101.6 --> 5106.88
like

5103.6 --> 5109.120000000001
modern art and like stupid

5106.88 --> 5111.4400000000005
special boy comments and quotes then

5109.12 --> 5114.08
you're gonna probably that sucks yeah

5111.44 --> 5116.239
you can judge a book by its covers but

5114.08 --> 5118.5599999999995
it might be good to still open it up

5116.239 --> 5122.0
read a passage and see if it is as

5118.56 --> 5124.8
terrible as you size it up to be because

5122.0 --> 5126.88
it is still important if you're going to

5124.8 --> 5128.8
use your prejudice

5126.88 --> 5131.36
to actually

5128.8 --> 5133.1990000000005
get the sensor level right it's

5131.36 --> 5136.159
basically you have to attune your

5133.199 --> 5138.48
readout and make sure that you actually

5136.159 --> 5140.879999999999
sized it up correctly or your prejudice

5138.48 --> 5143.36
is just gonna make wild swings

5140.88 --> 5145.52
and it's not gonna be about actually

5143.36 --> 5147.92
judging and sizing up anymore it's just

5145.52 --> 5149.360000000001
about keeping them out of your safe

5147.92 --> 5151.6
space and that's when things go

5149.36 --> 5155.28
completely wrong right you have to

5151.6 --> 5158.4800000000005
actually test your judgment

5155.28 --> 5158.48
keep it refined

5159.84 --> 5164.08
so again

5161.76 --> 5167.360000000001
keep throwing them at me

5164.08 --> 5169.6
i'll dispel every single one of them

5167.36 --> 5171.679
and it's not i'm not even trying to

5169.6 --> 5172.88
shame you akumuvar it's just like really

5171.679 --> 5175.92
funny

5172.88 --> 5177.159000000001
it's just a funny coincidence here

5175.92 --> 5181.96
right every

5177.159 --> 5181.96
preconceived saying and

5182.08 --> 5187.28
they're all given to us and they all

5184.4 --> 5191.28
work on that frequency that we operate

5187.28 --> 5191.28
in with society and everybody gets it

5191.36 --> 5196.48
but that doesn't mean that it's all just

5194.4 --> 5199.04
true because everybody

5196.48 --> 5201.04
gets it and will basically accept it

5199.04 --> 5203.04
right that doesn't mean it's absolutely

5201.04 --> 5205.76
true

5203.04 --> 5207.12
there's a lot of things that people will

5205.76 --> 5210.2390000000005
lay down

5207.12 --> 5212.639
their actions for when we confronted

5210.239 --> 5216.48
with such sayings

5212.639 --> 5216.4800000000005
that aren't actually true

5220.96 --> 5225.84
you like the conversation yeah thanks

5222.719 --> 5225.84
akuma virus me too

5226.86 --> 5231.438999999999
[Music]

5236.4 --> 5239.199
i appreciate it akumu virus thank you

5238.239 --> 5242.839999999999
for

5239.199 --> 5242.839999999999
thank you for your input

5255.84 --> 5260.719
ah yeah and by the way thank you for

5257.52 --> 5263.280000000001
that too matthew all good input right

5260.719 --> 5265.04
first meeting a person is totally weirdo

5263.28 --> 5267.199
you must naturally develop a view of

5265.04 --> 5270.639
that person creating prejudice based on

5267.199 --> 5274.08
previously seen behavior

5270.639 --> 5274.08
it's not stereotyping

5276.159 --> 5278.5599999999995
right

5277.12 --> 5281.44
it's like

5278.56 --> 5283.84
oh they're they're a weirdo

5281.44 --> 5285.44
well okay then you know they're a weirdo

5283.84 --> 5287.28
they have issues that doesn't mean

5285.44 --> 5290.32
they're completely useless you got to

5287.28 --> 5293.5199999999995
still give them a chance to see

5290.32 --> 5295.759999999999
how much of their weirdoness are they

5293.52 --> 5297.4400000000005
coping with

5295.76 --> 5300.8
do they have

5297.44 --> 5303.678999999999
a special skill to even it out have they

5300.8 --> 5307.6
developed another side to it that kind

5303.679 --> 5309.84
of balances it out karmically

5307.6 --> 5313.04
makes it more tolerable right somebody

5309.84 --> 5315.12
has a really crazy trait

5313.04 --> 5316.56
and they just have that crazy trade and

5315.12 --> 5319.12
they're terrible

5316.56 --> 5320.080000000001
they're gonna have a really bad life

5319.12 --> 5320.96
but

5320.08 --> 5323.84
if

5320.96 --> 5326.96
beside that crazy trait

5323.84 --> 5331.84
bad behavior they have like really

5326.96 --> 5333.6
amazing skill and like unique

5331.84 --> 5335.04
talent

5333.6 --> 5336.4800000000005
people are going to be much more

5335.04 --> 5338.639
forgiving

5336.48 --> 5340.159
of that crazy side because it's like

5338.639 --> 5342.639
yeah but he's got that other part and

5340.159 --> 5343.44
that's like that makes it worth it

5342.639 --> 5348.08
right

5343.44 --> 5350.4
it's always is about the balance

5348.08 --> 5351.84
what you have

5350.4 --> 5353.44
right

5351.84 --> 5357.52
real talent

5353.44 --> 5361.919999999999
typically balances itself out with

5357.52 --> 5365.120000000001
an equal strong amount of ego activity

5361.92 --> 5367.04
it usually does

5365.12 --> 5369.679
doesn't always do it

5367.04 --> 5371.5199999999995
but there is like a pretty linear

5369.679 --> 5375.0
correlation between

5371.52 --> 5375.0
the two strengths

5388.4 --> 5393.199
don't judge the book by its co yeah but

5390.719 --> 5395.92
you can judge it it's just

5393.199 --> 5397.44
are you going to write

5395.92 --> 5400.639
like a

5397.44 --> 5402.48
five page article that is pure criticism

5400.639 --> 5405.76
about a book

5402.48 --> 5406.959999999999
when you only read the covers

5405.76 --> 5409.92
no

5406.96 --> 5411.76
that would be silly

5409.92 --> 5413.52
right

5411.76 --> 5417.12
unless

5413.52 --> 5419.8
it's specifically about the cover

5417.12 --> 5422.159
because the cover like covers are

5419.8 --> 5425.28
advertisement for the book they are the

5422.159 --> 5428.48
calling card right

5425.28 --> 5430.4
so it's it's almost ironic say oh don't

5428.48 --> 5433.199
judge the book by the covers yeah but it

5430.4 --> 5435.92
is so important though

5433.199 --> 5437.678999999999
the cover matters it's the advertisement

5435.92 --> 5438.4
for the book

5437.679 --> 5441.12
so

5438.4 --> 5442.879999999999
it's almost silly not to judge a book by

5441.12 --> 5445.44
its covers

5442.88 --> 5447.92
right it's just that oh you're gonna do

5445.44 --> 5449.919999999999
you're gonna be the special boy review

5447.92 --> 5451.04
about it well

5449.92 --> 5452.639
then

5451.04 --> 5455.44
if you're going to actually review the

5452.639 --> 5457.04
content you got to read the content

5455.44 --> 5459.04
and if you just have like a book and

5457.04 --> 5461.12
you're like i don't even need to read

5459.04 --> 5464.719
this book i'm just going to review these

5461.12 --> 5467.12
covers because this is just what

5464.719 --> 5469.679
right well then you can do a review of

5467.12 --> 5469.679
the covers

5472.56 --> 5478.96
so it's a it's a tricky saying

5476.56 --> 5481.360000000001
and i think that most people do get

5478.96 --> 5484.0
what it implies again

5481.36 --> 5486.799999999999
it's on the normy level everybody does

5484.0 --> 5490.159
get it it's just when you really think

5486.8 --> 5491.679
about it it turns out to be just not so

5490.159 --> 5493.92
straightforward

5491.679 --> 5496.719
true

5493.92 --> 5500.4800000000005
see i love that [ __ ]

5496.719 --> 5500.4800000000005
and it's everywhere it's in everything

5501.92 --> 5505.84
meaning of words

5505.92 --> 5511.1990000000005
do you understand the meaning of the

5508.08 --> 5513.92
words that are coming out of your mouth

5511.199 --> 5516.0
that's not just something

5513.92 --> 5518.4
that flat earthers

5516.0 --> 5519.6
say to ballers that are going out of

5518.4 --> 5522.719
control

5519.6 --> 5526.2390000000005
or trolls in chat

5522.719 --> 5529.12
it actually applies to like everything

5526.239 --> 5531.919999999999
all the language that we use do you

5529.12 --> 5533.76
actually know the meanings of the words

5531.92 --> 5535.1990000000005
that are coming out of your mouth or do

5533.76 --> 5536.8
you just know

5535.199 --> 5540.879999999999
how people

5536.8 --> 5542.56
use it and how people would

5540.88 --> 5544.639
react to it

5542.56 --> 5546.719
right because if you know that the

5544.639 --> 5549.12
social part of the word you know the

5546.719 --> 5551.36
social influence of the word

5549.12 --> 5554.48
and how to connect it up

5551.36 --> 5555.159
well that doesn't automatically equate

5554.48 --> 5557.759999999999
to

5555.159 --> 5560.799999999999
understanding the actual word and the

5557.76 --> 5563.4400000000005
roots and the etymology in history

5560.8 --> 5568.360000000001
right that's another part

5563.44 --> 5568.36
that is not so common and general

5577.44 --> 5580.58
[Music]

5583.04 --> 5586.84
right akuma virus i appreciate

5585.35 --> 5589.1990000000005
[Music]

5586.84 --> 5592.32
it ring

5589.199 --> 5592.32
not so appreciated

5595.36 --> 5597.679
right

5597.92 --> 5602.56
it's a

5599.679 --> 5606.719
it's a good latter half

5602.56 --> 5608.320000000001
maybe it's the simp the sapinka

5606.719 --> 5610.4800000000005
that did this

5608.32 --> 5612.159
let's see tomorrow what happens when i

5610.48 --> 5614.4
take

5612.159 --> 5617.839999999999
a sip of that

5614.4 --> 5617.839999999999
like right at the start

5623.199 --> 5625.5199999999995
right

5628.719 --> 5633.92
anyhow is anybody still left in the chat

5631.84 --> 5637.84
besides akuma virus not that a minor

5633.92 --> 5637.84
kumu virus has been a great conversation

5640.0 --> 5644.52
is anybody still left here

5656.639 --> 5660.639
tragedy this is what happened to flat

5658.32 --> 5660.639
earth

5660.8 --> 5664.08
no no what

5662.96 --> 5666.56
okay

5664.08 --> 5668.32
i'm not this is not a troll i get it

5666.56 --> 5672.2390000000005
leveled off there

5668.32 --> 5674.719
but you're turning it inside out

5672.239 --> 5676.839999999999
prejudices what happened to flat earth

5674.719 --> 5679.199
no we were specifically

5676.84 --> 5682.32
pro-programmed against

5679.199 --> 5683.04
so people were conditioned

5682.32 --> 5686.159
with

5683.04 --> 5688.32
the sensation of shame

5686.159 --> 5690.08
and dumb

5688.32 --> 5692.239
and flat earth

5690.08 --> 5696.88
at a very young age and that's been

5692.239 --> 5699.759999999999
echoed even through media reinforcement

5696.88 --> 5701.84
that's not prejudice

5699.76 --> 5704.0
that's pre-programming that's like a

5701.84 --> 5707.119000000001
conditioned response that's

5704.0 --> 5709.679
not even like conscious really it is the

5707.119 --> 5713.5599999999995
hijacking of consciousness through

5709.679 --> 5713.56
pavlovian conditioning

5717.119 --> 5721.36
and yeah you can call yourself a planar

5719.52 --> 5723.280000000001
realm or now to me

5721.36 --> 5725.679
that's fine right but i do consider it

5723.28 --> 5728.32
like a special boy escape it mean it's

5725.679 --> 5730.4800000000005
still going to be flat earth and the

5728.32 --> 5731.759999999999
programming against flat earth is still

5730.48 --> 5734.959999999999
gonna be there

5731.76 --> 5739.1990000000005
you calling yourself something else

5734.96 --> 5742.36
is not gonna solve the problem

5739.199 --> 5742.36
you see

5743.04 --> 5745.84
it's not going to make the conditioning

5744.56 --> 5749.92
go away

5745.84 --> 5753.119000000001
just by you avoiding the trigger words

5749.92 --> 5753.119
for that conditioning

5753.76 --> 5759.4400000000005
that's why i adamantly call myself a

5757.199 --> 5761.04
flat earther

5759.44 --> 5764.638999999999
i do

5761.04 --> 5766.32
i am a flat earther arwyn i am a flat

5764.639 --> 5768.0
earther

5766.32 --> 5770.88
it's what i am

5768.0 --> 5773.199
i can reason it all out

5770.88 --> 5777.1990000000005
when i say flat earth

5773.199 --> 5779.919999999999
it's not about the the surface texture

5777.199 --> 5783.119
of what is in the realm on the surface

5779.92 --> 5787.119
it is the geometric orientation of the

5783.119 --> 5787.119
surface that is flat

5789.36 --> 5791.679
but i

5790.719 --> 5794.719
am

5791.679 --> 5797.719
here also to actually do tackle the

5794.719 --> 5797.719
conditioning

5798.56 --> 5805.679
because i am really disappointed about

5801.76 --> 5807.92
that conditioning against flat earth

5805.679 --> 5809.92
i mean i i like

5807.92 --> 5812.0
it sounds weird but i do kind of like

5809.92 --> 5815.679
the ball religion in a sense that it's

5812.0 --> 5817.6
like a really awesome mental toy to play

5815.679 --> 5819.04
around with and like the visuals it's

5817.6 --> 5822.08
all pretty

5819.04 --> 5822.08
it can be awesome

5823.36 --> 5828.08
but the part where you're shamed if you

5826.32 --> 5831.119
think the earth is flat or want to

5828.08 --> 5834.8
entertain that idea

5831.119 --> 5834.799999999999
that part i think is terrible

5835.04 --> 5840.639
and i wish there would just be an honest

5838.32 --> 5843.199
dual cosmogonical society

5840.639 --> 5844.96
and of course flat earth will win

5843.199 --> 5848.5599999999995
but the globe earth is still going to

5844.96 --> 5850.719
survive because it's interesting

5848.56 --> 5852.56
and because well because it's already

5850.719 --> 5855.04
it's already spawned this entire

5852.56 --> 5857.119000000001
fictional realm

5855.04 --> 5859.92
that a lot of storytelling traditions

5857.119 --> 5859.92
are leaning on

5860.4 --> 5866.08
right i don't think really like

5863.92 --> 5867.4400000000005
i don't really think it's even necessary

5866.08 --> 5871.199
anymore to do

5867.44 --> 5871.199
the anti-flat earth conditioning

5872.56 --> 5877.76
i think a new approach is required where

5875.44 --> 5879.44
indeed globe religion should be

5877.76 --> 5882.08
considered like religion like a

5879.44 --> 5884.879999999999
storytelling tradition or a magic trick

5882.08 --> 5887.199
you say and just like oh just don't be a

5884.88 --> 5890.639
flutter good flick it's all fake and

5887.199 --> 5890.638999999999
ruin it for everybody else

5891.04 --> 5895.88
right

5892.48 --> 5895.879999999999
that's annoying

5896.32 --> 5899.28
just don't do that

5900.0 --> 5905.92
and well you wouldn't need to

5903.119 --> 5907.599999999999
if the conditioning against flat earth

5905.92 --> 5910.159
would be stopped because then you could

5907.6 --> 5912.159000000001
just let the spectacle happen and then

5910.159 --> 5913.04
afterward talk to the people that were

5912.159 --> 5914.799999999999
there

5913.04 --> 5916.639
as a flat earther

5914.8 --> 5918.56
right and then it's up to them like no i

5916.639 --> 5920.719
wanted i want to still think about the

5918.56 --> 5922.56
dream or like hey yeah sure let's

5920.719 --> 5926.2390000000005
discuss how it's actually just a dream

5922.56 --> 5930.0
it's fake freedom
