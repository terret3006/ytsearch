maybe today is not going to be

173.599 --> 177.35999999999999
noisy outside day because that's very

175.84 --> 180.64000000000001
distracting yesterday

177.36 --> 182.15900000000002
and the days before like this guy over

180.64 --> 186.79999999999998

right

210.84 --> 213.84
so

214.319 --> 218.95899999999997
yesterday's flatters debate show was

216.319 --> 218.95899999999997

hello good servant good to see you

235.92 --> 240.0
right and akuma virus keeps on keeps on

239.28 --> 245.28

240.0 --> 245.28
too for some reason uh

245.439 --> 247.76
right

251.04 --> 255.84
also watch the movies watch the movies

254.72 --> 257.68
two days ago but i

255.84 --> 259.6
didn't get to talk about it yesterday

257.68 --> 263.44
didn't

259.6 --> 266.84000000000003
didn't come up i've eaten watching

263.44 --> 268.0
it's a movie i didn't know before was it

266.84 --> 272.4
fractured

268.0 --> 272.4
like a crime thriller with

273.44 --> 278.96
what's his name again that famous actor

276.16 --> 282.639
from silence of the lambs

278.96 --> 285.28
being sort of that character but

282.639 --> 286.0
in a different scenario it's his name

285.28 --> 297.84
again

286.0 --> 297.84
terrible for me to forget that

306.32 --> 310.32
let's see i got i gotta know the name is

309.759 --> 314.16
stupid

310.32 --> 314.15999999999997
not to me for me not to know it

314.56 --> 319.44
anthony hopkins that's it god

322.4 --> 326.88
yeah eric debated put out a good video

326.96 --> 331.68
or most of it was pretty decent i

330.08 --> 336.32
watched it he uploaded this

331.68 --> 338.0
night but he had a couple of weird

336.32 --> 340.52
claims in it though but he

338.0 --> 341.759
kind of put it pretty he put it down

340.52 --> 344.639
presuppositional

341.759 --> 345.84000000000003
it was weird not sure what he was trying

344.639 --> 349.199
to

345.84 --> 351.19899999999996
state like at the end of it

349.199 --> 353.039
he was kind of like okay imagine now

351.199 --> 357.12
it's an infinite plane and imagine

353.039 --> 360.31899999999996
infinite space above in space below

357.12 --> 363.28000000000003
and everything like putting it all

360.319 --> 365.44
into a maximum relative density scenario

363.28 --> 368.4
and then he started saying like oh yeah

365.44 --> 371.44
up there should be plasma and the plasma

368.4 --> 374.08
can be moving so fast and that's

371.44 --> 376.0
that's the stars that was weird it was

374.08 --> 378.4
really weird how you put that

376.0 --> 379.68
in there as well but pretty much up

378.4 --> 382.88
until that

379.68 --> 386.24
highly speculative

382.88 --> 386.639
point before that it was really good and

386.24 --> 388.8
he

386.639 --> 392.24
he laid it down very succinctly about

388.8 --> 392.24
relative density and everything

392.72 --> 396.319
he will forever be known as hell of a

394.4 --> 397.59999999999997
lecture yeah but i don't want to just

396.319 --> 401.44
call him that

397.6 --> 404.24
right he's a good actor he's also

401.44 --> 404.24
kind of proud

404.8 --> 409.44
so i don't just want to call him by his

408.24 --> 412.40000000000003
most

409.44 --> 412.4
known act

415.28 --> 417.75899999999996
anyway

418.8 --> 425.84000000000003
oh he had a falling out with your missus

422.8 --> 425.84000000000003
pj krishank

429.919 --> 440.0
oh god

436.0 --> 440.0
okay that sounds complicated

441.28 --> 451.84
that's what bibi calls him sure he does

445.44 --> 451.84
i'm sure he does

452.24 --> 457.68
the earth is not flat yeah it is it is

454.639 --> 457.68
it's not a spinning ball

460.08 --> 465.84
and it's not an infinite vacuum of space

462.84 --> 465.84
either

467.52 --> 471.12
she's drinking too much oh

471.49 --> 474.61
[Music]

476.84 --> 480.87899999999996
uh

478.8 --> 482.319
it sounds like you got some problems on

480.879 --> 492.16
your hands pj

482.319 --> 496.56
chris yank

492.16 --> 496.56
but yeah could it be is it

498.479 --> 502.15999999999997
i get the feeling like preliminary that

501.599 --> 504.319
maybe

502.16 --> 505.759
yeah she can't really handle the world

504.319 --> 509.199
situation right now

505.759 --> 512.5600000000001
but how is how is she with the

509.199 --> 513.76
with the corona for example i hope she

512.56 --> 517.68
realizes that is

513.76 --> 521.8389999999999
fake she's not like gonna secretly get a

517.68 --> 521.8389999999999
vaccine or whatever

525.04 --> 528.48
yeah yeah return to yeah also yeah i

527.04 --> 530.399
wanted to make a note of that too

528.48 --> 534.5600000000001
that's right yeah my subscribers did go

530.399 --> 540.0
up it's suddenly

534.56 --> 540.0
it's at 1970 that's the first time

544.88 --> 551.519
so yeah thanks all the new subscribers

548.72 --> 551.9200000000001
i've had a lot of new people active in

551.519 --> 556.5600000000001
chat

551.92 --> 556.56
in the recent week at least and more

561.44 --> 564.8800000000001
she had oh [ __ ]

569.04 --> 577.8389999999999
that sounds like a pretty messed up

571.2 --> 577.839
situation pj krishan

588.839 --> 605.839
so

590.88 --> 605.8389999999999
hello nathan r

616.839 --> 619.839
mm-hmm

633.12 --> 635.6
all right but

637.92 --> 643.68
yeah pj krishan is she at least

641.279 --> 645.68
in realization that taking the vaccis

643.68 --> 650.16
was wrong or is he

645.68 --> 661.8389999999999
basically maximum indoctrinated because

650.16 --> 661.8389999999999
that would be extremely heartbreaking

671.12 --> 675.6
or i don't know if you want to talk

672.8 --> 677.8389999999999
about it but

675.6 --> 679.6800000000001
that yeah from what you described that

677.839 --> 689.839
is

679.68 --> 689.8389999999999
that's extremely dramatic

703.92 --> 717.8389999999999
no she believes

742.839 --> 745.839
hmm

760.079 --> 764.16
right yeah tony with him yeah i heard

761.92 --> 764.16
that

764.24 --> 777.839
came by which one was it was a town

773.6 --> 777.839
let me see if i can find it or was that

778.32 --> 782.5600000000001
but there was apparently a town where

780.24 --> 785.6800000000001
somebody did indeed stand up

782.56 --> 789.5189999999999
and demanded proof

785.68 --> 793.279
and then when the court yeah when it

789.519 --> 797.04
couldn't be presented they rolled back

793.279 --> 801.36
all the all the measures all of them

797.04 --> 804.56
which town was it

801.36 --> 804.5600000000001
i'm trying to find it

811.279 --> 815.8389999999999
can't find it that's it

817.12 --> 831.76
alberta right

829.519 --> 832.9590000000001
the psyop is messing with people's mind

831.76 --> 834.56
yeah no [ __ ]

832.959 --> 836.8
it's not just messing with their mind

834.56 --> 840.8389999999999
it's completely taking it over

836.8 --> 844.24
but look it's been building for so long

840.839 --> 846.48
right i think sometimes

844.24 --> 848.0790000000001
trying to imagine what it must be like

846.48 --> 850.72
to be

848.079 --> 851.92
the fully indoctrinated like this that

850.72 --> 855.12
are just

851.92 --> 857.04
ignoring that it's evil

855.12 --> 859.199
and i think that they're probably doing

857.04 --> 862.959
it because they just

859.199 --> 864.7199999999999
want all the media like all the media

862.959 --> 868.4799999999999
output the news

864.72 --> 871.76
the ads they want everything to stop

868.48 --> 874.16
pushing right

871.76 --> 875.279
that's it i think that that is the main

874.16 --> 877.76
force

875.279 --> 878.639
that drives people to get really upset

877.76 --> 881.4399999999999
like

878.639 --> 882.399
quickly get it quickly i can't stand

881.44 --> 885.0400000000001
this

882.399 --> 887.44
how the media has changed it must change

885.04 --> 890.88
back and they tell me i have to take it

887.44 --> 895.6
and then it can stop so they just

890.88 --> 898.079
immediately like hyper obedient cattle

895.6 --> 900.32
just like okay i'm taking it quickly

898.079 --> 903.279
just stop it media stop go back to

900.32 --> 906.0790000000001
normal go back to how it used to be

903.279 --> 908.0
guess what people and with people i mean

906.079 --> 912.56
everyone

908.0 --> 915.6
it's never gonna go back

912.56 --> 917.5189999999999
this is a permanent breakup

915.6 --> 919.279
and the sooner you get over it the

917.519 --> 922.88
better because

919.279 --> 924.88
this breakup is a nasty one and the one

922.88 --> 928.16
breaking it up with you

924.88 --> 931.199
everyone that's addicted to media

928.16 --> 932.8
yeah it's a bad breakup she or he

931.199 --> 933.279
however you want to see it is telling

932.8 --> 935.04
you

933.279 --> 937.4399999999999
yeah i don't want anymore you can't deal

935.04 --> 940.88
with it well kill yourself

937.44 --> 942.9590000000001
right that nasty well yeah

940.88 --> 944.48
you ever had that somebody tell that to

942.959 --> 946.8
you kill yourself

944.48 --> 950.0
when you're in love with them ever heard

946.8 --> 954.639
that somebody say that face to face

950.0 --> 959.12
i have it's

954.639 --> 961.519
extremely painful you can't imagine that

959.12 --> 964.16
right so i believe that that is kind of

961.519 --> 964.16
what it's like

965.6 --> 972.88
she's very intelligent well no

969.6 --> 976.16
no you can't say that you could say

972.88 --> 978.48
you thought she was very intelligent but

976.16 --> 983.8389999999999
if somebody is that

978.48 --> 983.839
caught up in a spell then no

986.72 --> 990.5600000000001
i mean yeah you might have some

988.399 --> 993.759
mechanical grasp on

990.56 --> 997.92
details and complications

993.759 --> 1000.9590000000001
but if you can't even critically think

997.92 --> 1011.8389999999999
to live to survive

1000.959 --> 1011.8389999999999
then how intelligent are you really

1014.16 --> 1019.92
right and with well with your dad it

1017.6 --> 1021.839
might be even different like

1019.92 --> 1024.079
when you're the older people that

1021.839 --> 1025.6000000000001
already have had kids and maybe you have

1024.079 --> 1028.8799999999999
grandkids

1025.6 --> 1030.24
they might just be like like i just

1028.88 --> 1031.5200000000002
don't want to deal with this [ __ ]

1030.24 --> 1033.76
anymore

1031.52 --> 1033.76
like

1035.039 --> 1039.439
they just went out right it's too much

1037.52 --> 1053.84
it's too painful it's too

1039.439 --> 1053.8400000000001
treacherous at the last moment right

1060.08 --> 1066.799
right yeah pj christine i know it's

1063.44 --> 1067.8400000000001
it was kind of harsh but also if she

1066.799 --> 1071.36
really has some

1067.84 --> 1074.6399999999999
real intellect then she

1071.36 --> 1076.3999999999999
is very likely to have the correlating

1074.64 --> 1080.72
pride as well

1076.4 --> 1081.2800000000002
and i would constantly push on that it's

1080.72 --> 1084.32
like

1081.28 --> 1087.9189999999999
what you're supposed to be smart

1084.32 --> 1089.12
how can you not see this how can you not

1087.919 --> 1092.72
let this through

1089.12 --> 1096.6399999999999
right but yeah that could

1092.72 --> 1096.64
lead them some serious fallout

1098.32 --> 1102.799
but what i mean what are you gonna do

1100.32 --> 1102.799
then again

1104.96 --> 1109.8400000000001
i am not you

1115.36 --> 1123.84
he trusts the straw haired liar what

1118.88 --> 1123.8400000000001
who is that

1147.52 --> 1152.8799999999999
okay so you showed her statistics

1150.72 --> 1154.72
and she still believed or have you ever

1152.88 --> 1157.5200000000002
considered

1154.72 --> 1159.44
going to the root of it right she's

1157.52 --> 1161.9189999999999
intelligent so you say

1159.44 --> 1163.76
so why don't you lay down the entire

1161.919 --> 1166.0
history

1163.76 --> 1167.6
developments of medicine in the 20th

1166.0 --> 1169.52
century

1167.6 --> 1171.1999999999998
why don't you lay down in front of her

1169.52 --> 1174.16
the fraud about the

1171.2 --> 1175.1200000000001
germ theory and the virus model why

1174.16 --> 1178.16
don't you lay

1175.12 --> 1179.52
that at her feet right she is

1178.16 --> 1182.72
intelligent right

1179.52 --> 1185.679
well statistics it's all become so

1182.72 --> 1188.24
fraudulent and fluid and nonsensical

1185.679 --> 1189.919
in ways like yeah that's not really a

1188.24 --> 1193.679
good convincer

1189.919 --> 1195.919
it isn't it isn't to me even

1193.679 --> 1196.96
because i can't make any more sense of

1195.919 --> 1198.72
it

1196.96 --> 1201.44
if you just look at that but if you

1198.72 --> 1203.84
actually enlighten her perhaps

1201.44 --> 1207.28
about the entire model of what is

1203.84 --> 1209.6789999999999
transpiring and

1207.28 --> 1212.0
basically showing that it is a

1209.679 --> 1216.64
conceptual statistics based

1212.0 --> 1216.64
model that doesn't actually

1216.72 --> 1220.32
they don't actually have any scientific

1218.88 --> 1224.64
evidence for it right

1220.32 --> 1227.52
to the extent that apparently in alberta

1224.64 --> 1229.039
when presented when this argument was

1227.52 --> 1232.08
presented to court

1229.039 --> 1235.52
they had to completely retract

1232.08 --> 1240.0
like all measures right that's

1235.52 --> 1243.36
pretty dramatic evidence right there

1240.0 --> 1245.6
so yeah just just show googling

1243.36 --> 1248.8799999999999
statistics

1245.6 --> 1249.28
is not very convincing you have to

1248.88 --> 1251.7600000000002
really

1249.28 --> 1252.32
if she is actually smart then you have

1251.76 --> 1255.36
to

1252.32 --> 1258.6399999999999
actually approach it really smart

1255.36 --> 1258.6399999999999
and go to the core of it

1261.28 --> 1266.799
i recommend you find a clear moment in

1264.4 --> 1277.1200000000001
time between you

1266.799 --> 1279.52
and and do that

1277.12 --> 1281.12
right maybe even do some extra research

1279.52 --> 1284.24
on top of it

1281.12 --> 1288.7199999999998
but like show her the videos that i

1284.24 --> 1289.6
linked to about the fraud of louis

1288.72 --> 1292.64
pasteur

1289.6 --> 1293.52
and koch like how that all happened the

1292.64 --> 1297.76
history of it

1293.52 --> 1297.76
and how they actually manipulated

1299.12 --> 1305.84
the experiment

1312.0 --> 1319.919
oh boris johnson is the straw haired man

1316.88 --> 1322.64
he he's a giant straw man he's a walking

1319.919 --> 1325.5200000000002
living straw man

1322.64 --> 1326.64
he is scarecrow he is looking for his

1325.52 --> 1333.84
brain

1326.64 --> 1333.8400000000001
he's not gonna find it though

1354.08 --> 1358.96
he just wants the easy life oh you mean

1359.52 --> 1365.039
with terrible symptoms and sudden death

1363.76 --> 1368.1589999999999
and

1365.039 --> 1368.799
like outcomes where you just feel pain

1368.159 --> 1372.4
or

1368.799 --> 1374.96
nausea or dislocated in spirit the rest

1372.4 --> 1379.76
of your remaining life

1374.96 --> 1379.76
that type of easy life okay

1381.76 --> 1385.36
oh he's gonna find out it's all for

1384.159 --> 1388.7990000000002
nothing because you don't

1385.36 --> 1390.0
get the easy life for taking the jabs

1388.799 --> 1392.48
you don't

1390.0 --> 1394.08
it's already said like oh oh yeah you

1392.48 --> 1397.28
still have to wear the mask

1394.08 --> 1401.1999999999998
oh you have to get another one you don't

1397.28 --> 1404.0
get the easy life there is no easy life

1401.2 --> 1406.0
it doesn't exist it's a myth to make you

1404.0 --> 1410.4
go along to get along

1406.0 --> 1413.919
to drive you down the pen

1410.4 --> 1416.72
into the slaughterhouse there is

1413.919 --> 1417.6000000000001
no easy way out taking the jabs it

1416.72 --> 1420.159
doesn't help

1417.6 --> 1420.1589999999999
anything

1420.64 --> 1425.039
it's about as it gives about as much

1423.919 --> 1429.3600000000001
freedom as like

1425.039 --> 1432.4
going on a holiday weekend and that's it

1429.36 --> 1445.84
that's it that's about as much freedom

1432.4 --> 1445.8400000000001
as you get out of it

1449.6 --> 1452.799
google was in on it right okay well

1451.679 --> 1455.919
that's

1452.799 --> 1457.2
yeah but pj krishan everything is in on

1455.919 --> 1459.8400000000001
it

1457.2 --> 1461.8400000000001
all these big platforms polit

1459.84 --> 1465.12
politicians

1461.84 --> 1467.039
megacorp they're all in on it it helps

1465.12 --> 1470.1589999999999
not it doesn't help

1467.039 --> 1473.52
somebody who is in denial to show them

1470.159 --> 1476.72
that the ones lying to them

1473.52 --> 1479.279
which they cannot handle is everything

1476.72 --> 1480.88
yeah that doesn't help it only makes

1479.279 --> 1484.08
them more scared

1480.88 --> 1487.6000000000001
doesn't help they can't see it it

1484.08 --> 1490.3999999999999
only makes them more scared

1487.6 --> 1492.6399999999999
when you show them it's everything

1490.4 --> 1496.3200000000002
everything is in on this

1492.64 --> 1500.159
yeah it doesn't help you gotta

1496.32 --> 1502.96
go to the roots of the spell and show

1500.159 --> 1503.679
that the entire thing is fake right

1502.96 --> 1505.6000000000001
because

1503.679 --> 1507.2
only thing that's going to get them

1505.6 --> 1510.48
beyond their position

1507.2 --> 1512.88
of going along to get along out of fear

1510.48 --> 1515.52
and nostalgia for everything wanting to

1512.88 --> 1518.64
go back to normal

1515.52 --> 1520.1589999999999
is by dispelling it all

1518.64 --> 1522.0
that's the only way to do it because

1520.159 --> 1524.4
they have to overcome

1522.0 --> 1525.679
that fair obstacle well great way to do

1524.4 --> 1529.2
that is by

1525.679 --> 1532.72
dispelling diffusing the fear showing

1529.2 --> 1533.919
that it's actually all fraud like in the

1532.72 --> 1536.88
entire model

1533.919 --> 1538.4
like the entire model it's about as

1536.88 --> 1543.8400000000001
fraudulent

1538.4 --> 1543.8400000000001
as globe earth extended claims

1544.08 --> 1548.72
oh by the way i also watched the core

1546.4 --> 1550.799
yesterday again

1548.72 --> 1557.84
that movie was actually more impressive

1550.799 --> 1557.84
than i remembered it

1565.279 --> 1571.84
no howard

1578.24 --> 1582.4
right he's wrong and that's his decision

1581.12 --> 1586.08
yeah yeah and he's gonna

1582.4 --> 1586.0800000000002
pay for it yeah

1586.32 --> 1589.9189999999999
all right you gotta everybody has to

1588.799 --> 1592.8799999999999
relay oh you

1589.919 --> 1593.5200000000002
can't handle it you want it your way and

1592.88 --> 1595.279
that's it

1593.52 --> 1596.6399999999999
well that's okay that's fine you can do

1595.279 --> 1601.039
that you're gonna

1596.64 --> 1604.3200000000002
pay a price for it though

1601.039 --> 1608.0
and you cannot escape that

1604.32 --> 1610.1589999999999
right so you know it's not okay to just

1608.0 --> 1613.76
leave somebody in their delusions

1610.159 --> 1616.0
because the world right now does not

1613.76 --> 1619.2
allow those types of people

1616.0 --> 1627.84
to survive right so it's

1619.2 --> 1627.8400000000001
not okay

1632.4 --> 1637.1200000000001
like for me it's actually to the level

1635.039 --> 1639.679
not okay that i would

1637.12 --> 1643.039
probably end up in a fist fight with my

1639.679 --> 1643.039
own family if i heard

1643.279 --> 1647.52
like that they were gonna settle i would

1645.6 --> 1651.6789999999999
i would literally

1647.52 --> 1652.72
bash them i would start to physically

1651.679 --> 1656.159
intimidate them

1652.72 --> 1658.24
until they snap out of it but yeah

1656.159 --> 1659.8400000000001
that's me is kind of radical i wouldn't

1658.24 --> 1662.32
do it like with

1659.84 --> 1665.4399999999998
younger family but i don't really have

1662.32 --> 1665.4399999999998
any younger family

1665.919 --> 1670.96
well yeah through my brother perhaps but

1668.64 --> 1674.3200000000002
i don't know them

1670.96 --> 1677.2
but that's my attitude because it is

1674.32 --> 1677.9189999999999
a mind control spell and you have to get

1677.2 --> 1680.799
really

1677.919 --> 1682.3990000000001
[ __ ] aggressive to snap somebody out

1680.799 --> 1684.799
of that or

1682.399 --> 1685.76
you have to be extremely clever and

1684.799 --> 1689.2
completely

1685.76 --> 1692.48
understand the spell and i do

1689.2 --> 1693.919
and then proceed to explain it in such a

1692.48 --> 1696.3990000000001
way

1693.919 --> 1696.96
that you defuse the entire spell by

1696.399 --> 1700.9599999999998
showing

1696.96 --> 1704.3990000000001
how it's all based on completely

1700.96 --> 1707.279
wrong fraudulent models

1704.399 --> 1709.1999999999998
like that it literally does not exist

1707.279 --> 1712.24
it's not like all they mistake no

1709.2 --> 1717.919
it doesn't exist

1712.24 --> 1717.919
at all it's completely made up

1718.159 --> 1722.3990000000001
right and once somebody actually

1720.559 --> 1725.279
realizes that

1722.399 --> 1726.0
because they get all the puzzle pieces

1725.279 --> 1727.919
and then

1726.0 --> 1729.6
can use that to cross-reference

1727.919 --> 1733.2
everything that's happened

1729.6 --> 1736.32
then they cannot fear it anymore

1733.2 --> 1738.559
then they will not go along anymore

1736.32 --> 1739.4399999999998
because they know it's all wrong

1738.559 --> 1742.48
everything

1739.44 --> 1742.48
they say is wrong

1745.919 --> 1749.2
you don't even have to go down to rabbit

1748.08 --> 1752.399
hole you just

1749.2 --> 1756.0
have to get over

1752.399 --> 1759.9189999999999
that it's not what you want it to be

1756.0 --> 1760.24
that's all it's not what you want it to

1759.919 --> 1763.44
be

1760.24 --> 1764.559
this world is not what you want it to be

1763.44 --> 1767.6000000000001
anymore

1764.559 --> 1770.24
get the [ __ ] over it

1767.6 --> 1770.24
already

1770.64 --> 1778.48
move on learn

1775.44 --> 1782.64
don't exit because you're

1778.48 --> 1783.52
too cowardice to let it sink in that

1782.64 --> 1788.3200000000002
this world

1783.52 --> 1788.32
is not what you want it to be anymore

1792.48 --> 1796.88
green tea jim west how many freaking

1806.84 --> 1809.84
times

1817.52 --> 1821.2
yeah rumpus yesterday yeah rompers went

1820.799 --> 1824.48
all

1821.2 --> 1827.039
wrongful rumpy dumpty again

1824.48 --> 1828.24
on brandon's i literally tuned into

1827.039 --> 1831.76
brandon sometimes

1828.24 --> 1835.84
just to hear rompus again he's

1831.76 --> 1839.12
i i just got this weird thing with him

1835.84 --> 1843.279
just there's this amusing like

1839.12 --> 1843.279
he's just amusing

1846.799 --> 1852.399
motivational speech vibes yeah that's

1848.72 --> 1852.3990000000001
right i just gave you one

1853.039 --> 1857.12
i mean if i could have reached through

1854.96 --> 1860.24
the screen and strangle

1857.12 --> 1865.84
shaped you to make my point more

1860.24 --> 1865.84
more clear i would have done it

1875.2 --> 1882.159
i was addressing rob h

1878.399 --> 1884.6399999999999
pj chris shank return to normal

1882.159 --> 1887.279
all these people in my chat that just

1884.64 --> 1890.3200000000002
mentioned about family members

1887.279 --> 1892.799
being completely spellbound

1890.32 --> 1894.24
and their attempts to snap them out of

1892.799 --> 1897.36
it

1894.24 --> 1901.84
that's what i was addressing

1897.36 --> 1901.84
you could of course just scroll up to

1904.84 --> 1907.84
see

1912.64 --> 1915.919
no it's not futile

1918.32 --> 1924.559
futile is when you say okay there's just

1921.76 --> 1927.6
nothing i can do like

1924.559 --> 1930.72
and you don't actually

1927.6 --> 1933.1999999999998
give it your all because you know why

1930.72 --> 1934.0
because then afterward after they're

1933.2 --> 1938.32
suffering or

1934.0 --> 1940.48
even dead then you always have that

1938.32 --> 1942.799
sense like yeah i

1940.48 --> 1943.6
i just watched them suffer and die and i

1942.799 --> 1947.36
didn't

1943.6 --> 1949.519
give them it all right

1947.36 --> 1951.519
when they were hanging off that cliff i

1949.519 --> 1955.039
just let them fall

1951.519 --> 1959.6
that's gonna suck that's why i'm saying

1955.039 --> 1959.6
give it your all but do it smart

1960.559 --> 1964.8799999999999
dispel the whole thing by showing that

1963.919 --> 1966.96
the entire

1964.88 --> 1968.159
model on which it all rests is

1966.96 --> 1970.72
completely

1968.159 --> 1972.3200000000002
faulty and fraudulent like not just

1970.72 --> 1975.919
wrong statistics

1972.32 --> 1977.039
like the entire premise and foundation

1975.919 --> 1991.8400000000001
of the concept

1977.039 --> 1991.84
is nonsense it doesn't exist

2023.76 --> 2029.039
just some people just can't make them

2026.24 --> 2030.88
see lend them your eyes

2029.039 --> 2033.679
but you gotta connect first you gotta

2030.88 --> 2036.24
get real

2033.679 --> 2037.039
you gotta break some boundaries between

2036.24 --> 2039.44
you

2037.039 --> 2041.2
in order to accomplish that you gotta

2039.44 --> 2044.96
snap somebody out of it

2041.2 --> 2046.0800000000002
well snapping is not by softly petting

2044.96 --> 2049.52
them on the head

2046.08 --> 2052.72
no snapping is pretty dramatic

2049.52 --> 2054.879
sometimes physical right somebody's like

2052.72 --> 2056.3199999999997
hysterically rambling you slap them in

2054.879 --> 2059.52
their face

2056.32 --> 2060.0
to snap them out of it right you don't

2059.52 --> 2062.24
like

2060.0 --> 2063.44
oh poor boy are you penny now that

2062.24 --> 2067.0789999999997
doesn't help

2063.44 --> 2072.2400000000002
that doesn't help you know this this is

2067.079 --> 2072.2400000000002
universally intuitively no knowledge

2076.32 --> 2082.639
you have to get real you have to get

2079.679 --> 2084.32
perhaps a little rough even

2082.639 --> 2086.48
otherwise it's not going to work it's

2084.32 --> 2088.7200000000003
not going to snap them out of it

2086.48 --> 2091.119
there's spellbound they're stuck in the

2088.72 --> 2091.1189999999997
spell

2091.2 --> 2100.0789999999997
and the spell instructions is

2094.8 --> 2100.079
do everything we say and we'll go away

2101.04 --> 2105.119
except they don't go away and they'll

2104.0 --> 2117.839
come back with more

2105.119 --> 2117.839
things that you have to do

2120.09 --> 2124.119
[Music]

2136.0 --> 2140.0
some don't want to hear well then get

2137.92 --> 2143.359
really dark

2140.0 --> 2146.64
when they literally just do that then

2143.359 --> 2149.68
then tell them about details of how

2146.64 --> 2150.56
certain people have done exactly that

2149.68 --> 2154.0
and ended up

2150.56 --> 2157.7599999999998
with like terrible levels of pain

2154.0 --> 2160.96
and suffering with a guaranteed

2157.76 --> 2164.5600000000004
of a like get real

2160.96 --> 2168.079
show them the terror of what happens

2164.56 --> 2168.0789999999997
when you go along to get along

2169.92 --> 2187.839
like doesn't matter if they don't want

2173.599 --> 2187.839
to hear

2209.44 --> 2214.0
okay well rob h in that case if you

2212.48 --> 2217.04
literally told him everything

2214.0 --> 2217.04
then he might be

2217.28 --> 2220.88
sitting on it right if he doesn't want

2219.119 --> 2222.88
to talk anymore if he's getting all

2220.88 --> 2225.839
defensive

2222.88 --> 2228.079
that's actually a sign that maybe it is

2225.839 --> 2230.0789999999997
getting through and it's now

2228.079 --> 2231.44
time for him to process everything you

2230.079 --> 2234.96
said and then

2231.44 --> 2236.96
that will yield a final decision

2234.96 --> 2239.04
probably at some point where they will

2236.96 --> 2240.48
say okay i've thought about everything

2239.04 --> 2242.48
you said

2240.48 --> 2246.079
it took some time was very painful but

2242.48 --> 2246.079
it i think i get it

2246.32 --> 2249.6800000000003
or they're gonna say okay i've heard

2248.16 --> 2254.0
everything

2249.68 --> 2257.2799999999997
you said and i choose

2254.0 --> 2260.8
i choose to do it anyway

2257.28 --> 2264.2400000000002
if they're gonna go to that point then

2260.8 --> 2266.8
i would literally disown them

2264.24 --> 2267.2799999999997
they calmly after having thought about

2266.8 --> 2269.44
it all

2267.28 --> 2270.5600000000004
i would say i would say like okay then

2269.44 --> 2274.8
you are no more

2270.56 --> 2278.0
part of this life you are now

2274.8 --> 2280.8
in the road to the slaughterhouse of the

2278.0 --> 2280.8
beast system

2281.68 --> 2285.839
i am going to disconnect now

2313.76 --> 2318.96
what are you talking about jameson brown

2316.32 --> 2318.96
jason brown

2323.68 --> 2327.839
hello mandy young good to see you

2350.8 --> 2355.8390000000004
yeah a cps

2356.56 --> 2360.0
our problem is is that

2360.16 --> 2364.3199999999997
you know what the problem is i just

2362.079 --> 2365.76
don't even want to say it anymore cbs

2364.32 --> 2368.079
i don't want to say it anymore and i

2365.76 --> 2371.28
don't want to see you ask that question

2368.079 --> 2371.28
in my chat anymore

2371.76 --> 2378.6400000000003
if you really think it's all dandy

2374.96 --> 2382.48
then keep taking it [ __ ] keep taking it

2378.64 --> 2385.7599999999998
i mean it rapid succession

2382.48 --> 2385.76
shove it in there buddy

2386.64 --> 2395.7599999999998
i don't want to hear your [ __ ]

2390.56 --> 2399.04
skepticism about the dangers of it yeah

2395.76 --> 2401.8390000000004
the overwhelming evidence

2399.04 --> 2402.32
if you can't see it then you cannot be

2401.839 --> 2404.96
made

2402.32 --> 2404.96
to see it

2408.319 --> 2416.8
also we don't care about your skepticism

2412.319 --> 2420.079
yeah you not being able to see it

2416.8 --> 2425.8390000000004
is your problem cps it's

2420.079 --> 2425.8390000000004
your problem

2434.48 --> 2441.44
now why do you ask it

2438.079 --> 2443.76
the evidence what's the problem with the

2441.44 --> 2446.7200000000003
facts

2443.76 --> 2449.76
what is what is the problem what do you

2446.72 --> 2453.839
think is the problem

2449.76 --> 2453.8390000000004
what do you think is the problem

2454.0 --> 2461.359
cps what do you think it is

2458.16 --> 2467.839
what do you even know about it

2461.359 --> 2467.839
to ask such a question

2478.839 --> 2482.64
so

2480.48 --> 2495.839
you don't need confirmation to make a

2482.64 --> 2495.839
decision what

2506.839 --> 2509.839
uh

2519.839 --> 2528.0
you want supporting evidence you freak

2524.0 --> 2529.599
dude overwhelming overwhelming evidence

2528.0 --> 2534.48
testimonies of

2529.599 --> 2539.2000000000003
actual doctors specialists

2534.48 --> 2542.319
like hundreds of them hundreds

2539.2 --> 2543.359
and everything they say is consistent

2542.319 --> 2545.359
with one another

2543.359 --> 2547.2
and they don't even have all contact

2545.359 --> 2549.04
with one another they're all coming to

2547.2 --> 2551.52
the same conclusions

2549.04 --> 2554.0
same background research the original

2551.52 --> 2556.16
literature

2554.0 --> 2557.359
of these supposed vaccines that aren't

2556.16 --> 2559.2799999999997
really vaccines

2557.359 --> 2560.4
the tests they've done like the

2559.28 --> 2564.7200000000003
information

2560.4 --> 2568.1600000000003
is overwhelming cps

2564.72 --> 2572.0
you gotta be a literally blind

2568.16 --> 2576.24
[ __ ] to think that there is no

2572.0 --> 2579.92
evidence against the situation here

2576.24 --> 2583.04
it's overwhelming literally

2579.92 --> 2586.56
overwhelming hours

2583.04 --> 2593.839
hours a day new

2586.56 --> 2593.839
things hours a day of evidence

2602.24 --> 2609.5989999999997
just like globe evidence no don doodle

2605.599 --> 2612.2400000000002
no no actual doctors

2609.599 --> 2615.119
talking about the models referencing

2612.24 --> 2617.2
statistical fraud happening

2615.119 --> 2618.96
showing how the virus hasn't actually

2617.2 --> 2622.72
been isolated if you even believe

2618.96 --> 2626.319
there is such a thing right the endless

2622.72 --> 2626.8799999999997
amounts of problems the spike proteins

2626.319 --> 2630.319
how they

2626.88 --> 2633.599
actually cause huge amounts of problems

2630.319 --> 2637.359
which is literally in the procedure of

2633.599 --> 2640.56
being proven right now

2637.359 --> 2644.24
all these people hospitalized

2640.56 --> 2647.359
for covet-like symptoms and [ __ ]

2644.24 --> 2649.1189999999997
the new waves right hospitals

2647.359 --> 2650.96
suddenly are kind of filling up in

2649.119 --> 2654.48
contrast to last year

2650.96 --> 2656.64
guess what every freaking time

2654.48 --> 2657.52
half of these these people are

2656.64 --> 2661.04
vaccinated

2657.52 --> 2661.04
or much more than half

2661.28 --> 2667.8390000000004
yeah the evidence is

2665.079 --> 2668.4
overwhelming it's like the evidence is

2667.839 --> 2671.52
being

2668.4 --> 2674.839
live shown with

2671.52 --> 2679.04
live field test results

2674.839 --> 2680.24
life as we go it's happening right now

2679.04 --> 2691.839
it's being shown to you

2680.24 --> 2691.839
right now the evidence for that

2701.52 --> 2710.0
why was that why was what so hard

2705.44 --> 2710.0
dude i talk about this almost every day

2711.44 --> 2719.839
and you come here in my chat on a

2714.56 --> 2719.839
regular basis

2720.079 --> 2733.8390000000004
you know it you should be knowing

2723.44 --> 2733.839
everything i just said

2743.76 --> 2748.0
ah george sanford well you should know

2745.76 --> 2749.2000000000003
better as a critical thinker you should

2748.0 --> 2751.839
know better

2749.2 --> 2753.68
than that people that believe in

2751.839 --> 2754.64
something actually inform themselves

2753.68 --> 2757.52
before they enter

2754.64 --> 2757.92
some kind of a debate field no no people

2757.52 --> 2760.56
just

2757.92 --> 2762.2400000000002
jump right into it and informed just

2760.56 --> 2765.2799999999997
look at ballers they do this

2762.24 --> 2768.319
all the time strategically so

2765.28 --> 2770.7200000000003
so why would you assume

2768.319 --> 2773.2
that jabbers would actually look into it

2770.72 --> 2775.839
before they enter a discussion

2773.2 --> 2775.839
no

2776.8 --> 2780.0
as a critical thinker you should come to

2778.56 --> 2781.44
the conclusion that it's much more

2780.0 --> 2783.68
likely that they want

2781.44 --> 2786.079
because that's a pattern it's a pattern

2783.68 --> 2789.2
in a whole bunch of humans

2786.079 --> 2792.96
in different fields and the pattern is

2789.2 --> 2795.52
is systemic and consistent

2792.96 --> 2797.92
in different fields now so yeah no

2795.52 --> 2800.079
indoctrinated foolish people typically

2797.92 --> 2802.48
don't inform themselves before they

2800.079 --> 2805.119
enter a discussion

2802.48 --> 2805.119
it's a thing

2808.56 --> 2812.4
you're a newcomer only last week

2814.839 --> 2817.839
really

2820.72 --> 2825.04
i okay well then your name is very close

2824.64 --> 2828.839
to

2825.04 --> 2831.599
uh other people's names because

2828.839 --> 2832.96
cps especially the capital letters i've

2831.599 --> 2837.599
seen that before

2832.96 --> 2840.0
like for months and months and months so

2837.599 --> 2840.88
although not necessarily in my chat dude

2840.0 --> 2843.119
it look

2840.88 --> 2844.1600000000003
unless you're going to have an actual

2843.119 --> 2847.76
distinct

2844.16 --> 2852.96
name just a bunch of characters

2847.76 --> 2855.6800000000003
how am i supposed to identify you

2852.96 --> 2857.04
right it's just like the guy who turned

2855.68 --> 2860.24
out to be a pretty cool guy

2857.04 --> 2860.8
a person like who calls yourself a

2860.24 --> 2863.52
person

2860.8 --> 2863.92
like yeah he wants to stay anonymous

2863.52 --> 2866.96
okay

2863.92 --> 2873.839
but it's your initials

2866.96 --> 2873.839
yeah oh well that helps a lot

2881.2 --> 2885.2
yeah james brown that's exactly what i

2883.52 --> 2888.48
thought now this may be

2885.2 --> 2891.4399999999996
another guy that just

2888.48 --> 2893.119
happened to also be called cps because

2891.44 --> 2896.2400000000002
that's what happens when you

2893.119 --> 2899.76
lit you when your name consists of three

2896.24 --> 2902.0789999999997
characters guess what there's gonna be

2899.76 --> 2904.079
a couple of hundred thousand other

2902.079 --> 2904.8900000000003
people out there that are going to have

2904.079 --> 2906.88
that same name

2904.89 --> 2910.4
[Music]

2906.88 --> 2913.04
and sock accounts and troll accounts

2910.4 --> 2913.599
that will have that name yeah that's

2913.04 --> 2915.68
what

2913.599 --> 2917.28
is happening that's what's gonna happen

2915.68 --> 2920.48
when you have a three

2917.28 --> 2920.48
character name

2922.72 --> 2926.48
yeah and it is short for child

2924.88 --> 2928.079
protective service so that doesn't

2926.48 --> 2931.839
really help either

2928.079 --> 2931.8390000000004
huh cps

2932.96 --> 2936.16
yeah but ajm

2937.359 --> 2943.839
he's actually revealed his name

2944.0 --> 2946.24
right

2949.04 --> 2952.88
and also he's been around for what is it

2951.2 --> 2957.839
now three years

2952.88 --> 2957.839
two years at least

2968.839 --> 2971.839
right

2972.48 --> 2976.0
so yeah sorry if it seems like i'm being

2974.88 --> 2985.839
a little

2976.0 --> 2985.839
harsh on you cbs

2990.72 --> 2995.2
hello weird

2995.359 --> 3000.96
mike just turning off like that

2999.04 --> 3002.5589999999997
right so i'm still not convinced you're

3000.96 --> 3004.16
not actually that troll

3002.559 --> 3005.599
i think you're trying to gaslight me

3004.16 --> 3006.16
it's not like the first time that's

3005.599 --> 3010.079
happened

3006.16 --> 3010.0789999999997
they're constantly doing that [ __ ]

3010.839 --> 3013.839
so

3015.599 --> 3021.599
if you if you want to be a serious

3018.72 --> 3021.9199999999996
chat participant and follow my show and

3021.599 --> 3025.28
be

3021.92 --> 3029.52
part of the chat i would

3025.28 --> 3029.52
change your account name

3030.079 --> 3036.1600000000003
because it's very inconvenient

3033.2 --> 3036.16
that you're called this

3036.8 --> 3041.92
because they are what troll other trolls

3039.599 --> 3045.44
that also call themselves cp

3041.92 --> 3055.839
or cps or cs or just

3045.44 --> 3055.839
that sort of [ __ ]

3059.92 --> 3064.559
didn't know that was the rules no it's

3062.48 --> 3066.319
not the rules it's for your own

3064.559 --> 3068.559
protection

3066.319 --> 3070.5589999999997
if you are really a serious person that

3068.559 --> 3071.92
wants to be in my chat and communicate

3070.559 --> 3074.0
and be part of the show and have

3071.92 --> 3078.7200000000003
discussions

3074.0 --> 3081.599
i would adapt your account name

3078.72 --> 3083.839
just compare it to everybody else here

3081.599 --> 3083.839
right

3088.079 --> 3094.4
i'm not saying you have to roll out your

3091.2 --> 3094.3999999999996
full name or anything

3094.8 --> 3100.88
but just three characters is not

3098.079 --> 3100.88
it's not good

3101.839 --> 3105.52
yeah i'll show about guys initials

3103.92 --> 3106.88
indeed yeah well that's what it's

3105.52 --> 3108.8

3108.8 --> 3113.3590000000004
why being mean to me oh i'll leave then

3114.4 --> 3118.64

3122.839 --> 3125.839
heart

parker that's because i thought he was a

3159.68 --> 3162.96
troll because i've seen other trolls

3162.319 --> 3167.44
that are

3162.96 --> 3170.7200000000003
kinda called like that i just mix it up

3167.44 --> 3170.7200000000003
i have to address that

3179.2 --> 3195.839
yes jim west i know

3205.2 --> 3212.24
uh no james brown jason brown i mean

3209.44 --> 3213.28

3212.24 --> 3223.839
you barely learn

3213.28 --> 3223.8390000000004
[ __ ] at school these days so

3224.0 --> 3228.4
like these videos whether you believe it

3226.16 --> 3230.319
or not fall under education and you can

3228.4 --> 3235.2000000000003
look at it from all kinds of angles

3230.319 --> 3237.839
right whether it be psychological study

3235.2 --> 3240.64
of me if you'd refuse to believe

3237.839 --> 3242.48
everything i have to say

3240.64 --> 3244.64
because i'm a flat earther well then you

3242.48 --> 3248.319
can just perceive what i do

3244.64 --> 3250.64
as a study of a flat earther then right

3248.319 --> 3251.7599999999998
but this is education one way or the

3250.64 --> 3255.2
other

3251.76 --> 3255.2000000000003
whatever you get out of it

3256.16 --> 3265.839
you get out of it

3275.76 --> 3279.8390000000004

him

3298.559 --> 3310.0
oh okay okay right

3306.559 --> 3314.799
not supporting public education really

3310.0 --> 3318.24
so what about this this my channel

3314.799 --> 3318.24
is effectively public

3318.319 --> 3321.44
anybody that wants to on a voluntary

3320.799 --> 3326.079
basis

3321.44 --> 3326.079
can learn here

3328.96 --> 3335.839
if you're above 12.

3349.2 --> 3352.96

3354.559 --> 3357.92
you calling you james brown

3360.839 --> 3363.839
huh

3380.0 --> 3383.92
no pear-shaped nobody's gonna throw

3382.24 --> 3387.1189999999997
anybody in camps

3383.92 --> 3389.839
they're gonna open up the camps

3387.119 --> 3391.92
make everybody so afraid that they'll

3389.839 --> 3392.88
believe that they can't survive where

3391.92 --> 3397.839
they're at

3392.88 --> 3401.359
anymore and they will go to the camps

3397.839 --> 3401.359
yeah that's what's gonna happen

3401.76 --> 3406.3190000000004
don't you see how this game works

3403.839 --> 3408.96
everything

3406.319 --> 3410.16
you're afraid of is not gonna happen no

3408.96 --> 3412.319
instead

3410.16 --> 3414.64
they're just gonna make you so afraid

3412.319 --> 3417.2
that you'll flip it around inside

3414.64 --> 3417.2
yourself

3417.44 --> 3421.839
reversed world switch and then you will

3420.4 --> 3425.52
do it

3421.839 --> 3429.52
you see how that works they will make

3425.52 --> 3430.16
you do it nobody's gonna force you

3429.52 --> 3433.28
anywhere

3430.16 --> 3434.3999999999996
they're gonna make you do it and the

3433.28 --> 3437.6800000000003
only way

3434.4 --> 3447.839
to not get caught up is by completely

3437.68 --> 3447.839
and permanently disengaging

3514.839 --> 3517.839
right

3529.68 --> 3534.16

opinions with what he's doing

3633.2 --> 3637.1189999999997

we do

3637.119 --> 3642.0
i greatly respect him for his efforts

3640.88 --> 3645.359

that we're actually secretly satanists

3911.359 --> 3915.68
and here to destroy the world just

3913.68 --> 3918.3999999999996
because we don't want to get along with

3915.68 --> 3921.44
your stupid little made-up

3918.4 --> 3924.1600000000003
mind control [ __ ] story yeah

3921.44 --> 3926.64
because say whatever the [ __ ] you want

3924.16 --> 3929.68
biden

3926.64 --> 3932.799
[ __ ] old [ __ ]

3929.68 --> 3936.24
and all the other [ __ ]

3932.799 --> 3939.7599999999998
and news readers yeah we're the virus

3936.24 --> 3942.8799999999997
say whatever the [ __ ] you want yeah

3939.76 --> 3947.599

3942.88 --> 3947.599
by a noose on camera

3950.559 --> 3956.1600000000003
so keep squirming for us keep lying keep

3953.92 --> 3957.119
making it worse and worse and worse keep

3956.16 --> 3959.2
going yeah

3957.119 --> 3960.48
you know where this is going to end and

3959.2 --> 3965.839
so do we

3960.48 --> 3965.839
looking forward to it hmm

3987.039 --> 3993.8390000000004
what the hell does that even mean again

3996.799 --> 4007.839
like lit what are you saying can what

4000.16 --> 4007.839
is that

4013.039 --> 4017.92
oh right yeah yeah no but

4016.16 --> 4019.52
you see what that was that is his

4017.92 --> 4022.559
hollywood time he was

4019.52 --> 4026.16
when you're grafted into hollywood you

4022.559 --> 4029.119
must be gay you understand

4026.16 --> 4030.3999999999996
and if you're not actually gay then you

4029.119 --> 4033.2000000000003
must

4030.4 --> 4034.0
play along with the make believe that

4033.2 --> 4037.1189999999997
you could be

4034.0 --> 4037.599
gay do you understand that's what it is

4037.119 --> 4040.799
to be

4037.599 --> 4044.079
a hollywood star

4040.799 --> 4046.88
because if you don't you immediately get

4044.079 --> 4047.44
shoved in the corner and not everything

4046.88 --> 4051.599
is

4047.44 --> 4051.599
every attention comes off yeah

4052.64 --> 4059.2
so agm i yeah you have three children

4056.799 --> 4064.24
and a wife

4059.2 --> 4064.24
are you are you are they living on a

4074.839 --> 4077.839
farm

4084.16 --> 4088.319
yeah it is partly why he left hollywood

4086.079 --> 4091.52
because he he's even explained this like

4088.319 --> 4094.0
he was okay to go along with that [ __ ]

4091.52 --> 4094.799
to pretend to be a little gay-ish

4094.0 --> 4098.08
whatever

4094.799 --> 4100.239
because it's popular and right

4098.08 --> 4102.839
but as soon as they went to like okay

4100.239 --> 4106.159
now you have to promote trans

4102.839 --> 4109.2789999999995
kids surgical mutilation

4106.159 --> 4110.96
of children young children right that's

4109.279 --> 4113.1990000000005
when he kind of snapped that's

4110.96 --> 4114.319
like this is too much but they kept

4113.199 --> 4118.0
pushing him like no

4114.319 --> 4119.120000000001
no no you cannot set a limiter when

4118.0 --> 4122.88
you're in that system

4119.12 --> 4126.3589999999995
you cannot set a limiter you must

4122.88 --> 4129.839
vow to go towards the most

4126.359 --> 4130.88
disgusting imaginable thing and be able

4129.839 --> 4133.679
to promote it

4130.88 --> 4135.359
if you want to be part of this glorious

4133.679 --> 4147.839
hollywood system

4135.359 --> 4147.839
yeah and he didn't do it

4150.48 --> 4153.599999999999
right so yeah

4158.48 --> 4164.959999999999
i have seen his earlier movies

4161.52 --> 4168.56
and he has played the gay guy role he

4164.96 --> 4170.96
acts a gay guy role you know

4168.56 --> 4172.319
owen benjamin gets gay people he's known

4170.96 --> 4176.4
a lot of them

4172.319 --> 4179.6
right because he was in hollywood huh

4176.4 --> 4181.5199999999995
yeah so that doesn't make you gay yeah

4179.6 --> 4183.52
i've known quite a few gay people

4181.52 --> 4187.359
throughout my life

4183.52 --> 4190.2390000000005
i am not gay even though

4187.359 --> 4191.120000000001
at the beginning they tried to talk it

4190.239 --> 4194.32
into me

4191.12 --> 4196.96
some creepy [ __ ]

4194.32 --> 4197.92
literally just projecting that [ __ ] on

4196.96 --> 4199.92
me

4197.92 --> 4202.159
and i wasn't taking it all that serious

4199.92 --> 4204.4
back then so i was like oh sure you're

4202.159 --> 4205.36
gay whatever that is you know as long as

4204.4 --> 4207.04
i don't have to like

4205.36 --> 4208.96
have sex with the guy or whatever then

4207.04 --> 4212.0
it's fine okay

4208.96 --> 4212.56
whatever yeah then i figured out oh [ __ ]

4212.0 --> 4215.44
they

4212.56 --> 4215.4400000000005
they really

4215.76 --> 4219.52
it's not just a stupid superficial

4218.239 --> 4221.919999999999
nonsense title

4219.52 --> 4222.56
no they actually want me to be gay i'm

4221.92 --> 4226.4
not gonna

4222.56 --> 4230.64
[ __ ] do that you pieces of [ __ ]

4226.4 --> 4245.839999999999
no i'd rather do

4230.64 --> 4245.84
something else

4256.84 --> 4259.84
uh

4265.84 --> 4271.92
right yeah pj cruise check yeah it is

4268.88 --> 4274.56
but you can't seriously be for it right

4271.92 --> 4278.64
i've thought about it though

4274.56 --> 4278.64
so what if you suggest that

4279.28 --> 4286.159
nah this is crazy [ __ ]

4283.12 --> 4289.44
i'm just thinking that you know

4286.159 --> 4292.32
when you're a kid and

4289.44 --> 4293.04
your parents literally start letting you

4292.32 --> 4295.599999999999
sink in

4293.04 --> 4296.56
trans nonsense and you get the freaking

4295.6 --> 4298.4800000000005
operation

4296.56 --> 4301.280000000001
what if you then much later figure out

4298.48 --> 4303.44
like wait this is complete [ __ ]

4301.28 --> 4306.32
why was i grafted into this i want to

4303.44 --> 4310.5599999999995
have kids now i can't

4306.32 --> 4310.5599999999995
yeah maybe

4310.88 --> 4316.32
they have the right to

4314.239 --> 4318.5599999999995
kill the ones that were actually

4316.32 --> 4320.96
responsible for doing that

4318.56 --> 4321.84
they want to do that probably not who

4320.96 --> 4325.04
wants to do that

4321.84 --> 4328.159000000001
right yeah so i've said too much

4325.04 --> 4330.96
i'm just saying

4328.159 --> 4332.96
in a certain way they kind of deserve

4330.96 --> 4334.88
vengeance for it

4332.96 --> 4336.96
although yeah because it's kids you know

4334.88 --> 4338.88
when you do that [ __ ]

4336.96 --> 4341.44
when you're older when you're adult

4338.88 --> 4343.52
that's your freaking issue yeah oh you

4341.44 --> 4346.159
regret it well you decided to

4343.52 --> 4348.4800000000005
when you're a little kid you don't know

4346.159 --> 4350.159
what the hell is going on and you trust

4348.48 --> 4352.718999999999
your parents

4350.159 --> 4354.719
to make good decisions for you and to

4352.719 --> 4357.76
not let you wander off

4354.719 --> 4359.6
into death right so

4357.76 --> 4361.6
when it turns out you're older and they

4359.6 --> 4364.8
did do that

4361.6 --> 4368.64
that deserves some level of retribution

4364.8 --> 4371.1990000000005
in my opinion ah yeah

4368.64 --> 4371.76
yeah parents yeah parents who who all

4371.199 --> 4374.639999999999
did that

4371.76 --> 4378.159000000001
yeah [ __ ] your pants gonna do that

4374.64 --> 4378.159000000001
anyway from all the butt sex

4378.56 --> 4389.04
yeah vengeance

4385.679 --> 4392.96
you think you can just sin

4389.04 --> 4396.719
and mutilate without retribution

4392.96 --> 4400.56
within creation ah

4396.719 --> 4402.96
no you can move it on in time you can

4400.56 --> 4413.84
push it forward eventually it's going to

4402.96 --> 4413.84
come back to you

4430.8 --> 4438.159000000001
what does that even mean anymore

4435.28 --> 4439.199
acted like a girl i mean acting like a

4438.159 --> 4441.839999999999
gamma

4439.199 --> 4442.239
but what does acting like a girl even

4441.84 --> 4445.92
mean

4442.239 --> 4448.48
anymore for for a boy

4445.92 --> 4451.04
see like what does that even mean

4448.48 --> 4451.04
anymore

4452.84 --> 4455.84
right

4458.4 --> 4466.0
that there's no more

4461.92 --> 4468.32
super distinct roles out there

4466.0 --> 4469.679
i mean they're still out there in very

4468.32 --> 4473.199
traditional

4469.679 --> 4476.32
like families and [ __ ] but it's not

4473.199 --> 4483.04
being publicly upheld anymore

4476.32 --> 4485.36
so yeah

4483.04 --> 4486.64
i don't think it's even about behavior

4485.36 --> 4490.96
like that anymore it's

4486.64 --> 4495.04
just weird

4490.96 --> 4495.04
social construct thingies

4495.28 --> 4498.4
and it is also the idea of like oh i'm a

4497.92 --> 4502.0
part

4498.4 --> 4502.719
of it i am into this too that makes it

4502.0 --> 4505.679
popular

4502.719 --> 4508.4800000000005
it's it's really not even about oh is

4505.679 --> 4508.4800000000005
this actually

4508.84 --> 4515.679
supposed female spirited a man's body

4512.159 --> 4517.92
like really really

4515.679 --> 4520.4
and you can actually determine that at

4517.92 --> 4523.52
an extremely young age

4520.4 --> 4526.4
how how would you determine that

4523.52 --> 4527.120000000001
doesn't make any damn sense like a

4526.4 --> 4530.4
little kid

4527.12 --> 4531.599999999999
doesn't know how to properly dream about

4530.4 --> 4533.759999999999
the future they can't

4531.6 --> 4536.320000000001
size it up what they really want to do

4533.76 --> 4538.2390000000005
later they really can't

4536.32 --> 4540.639999999999
right they might discover a couple of

4538.239 --> 4541.28
really interesting talents that will

4540.64 --> 4544.08
carry

4541.28 --> 4545.44
through their entire life but that's

4544.08 --> 4548.159
talents that's not

4545.44 --> 4549.678999999999
how their personality is gonna unfold

4548.159 --> 4553.12
socially

4549.679 --> 4558.2390000000005
yeah so they don't know you can't tell

4553.12 --> 4558.239
how it none of it makes sense it's

4559.04 --> 4564.64
yeah trans kids it's really really bad

4565.6 --> 4571.4400000000005
definitely child abuse like beyond that

4578.84 --> 4581.84
really

4582.159 --> 4584.639999999999
yuck

4589.82 --> 4597.36
[Music]

4592.96 --> 4597.36
being effeminate right

4605.44 --> 4608.48
right but being effeminate can also be

4608.08 --> 4611.5199999999995
in

4608.48 --> 4615.28
joke form right but if you're like

4611.52 --> 4618.080000000001
going to conduct yourself socially

4615.28 --> 4619.759999999999
as effeminate yeah that's really [ __ ]

4618.08 --> 4622.5599999999995
annoying

4619.76 --> 4624.320000000001
if you're a guy it's already [ __ ]

4622.56 --> 4625.360000000001
annoying if you're a lady not just

4624.32 --> 4629.199
kidding ladies

4625.36 --> 4629.199
but it's like yeah

4629.6 --> 4636.0
but even as a joke sometimes i like to

4633.84 --> 4637.4400000000005
act a little effeminate but i just keep

4636.0 --> 4641.36
it very short because

4637.44 --> 4644.4
it really repulses me actually

4641.36 --> 4646.639999999999
because i am homophobic

4644.4 --> 4647.599999999999
right talk about a freaking convoluted

4646.64 --> 4651.4400000000005
word

4647.6 --> 4655.360000000001
but it's it's real with me

4651.44 --> 4658.159
i have literal physiological responses

4655.36 --> 4658.159
to gayness

4663.12 --> 4665.84
all right i'm gonna

4667.04 --> 4679.84
be back in two minutes hang in there

4704.84 --> 4707.84
so

4754.08 --> 4763.84
look that up

4765.51 --> 4768.68
[Applause]

4773.92 --> 4780.08
yes wow i actually said it right

4777.44 --> 4783.12
physiological response i was like in

4780.08 --> 4785.04
doubt like is that even

4783.12 --> 4787.679
proper classification but yeah now

4785.04 --> 4791.84
looking it up yeah that's exactly i was

4787.679 --> 4793.52
sometimes i doubt my own language skills

4791.84 --> 4795.04
then i look it up as like holy [ __ ] now

4793.52 --> 4798.4800000000005
it is exactly what it

4795.04 --> 4802.08
was supposed to be it is weird

4798.48 --> 4802.08
i'm better at english than i think

4802.84 --> 4805.84
sometimes

4817.76 --> 4822.400000000001
all right yeah pg christian it's not

4819.52 --> 4825.6
just that they can't make the decision

4822.4 --> 4828.5599999999995
they're not developed

4825.6 --> 4830.0
in order to even it's not even about

4828.56 --> 4833.1990000000005
their decision making

4830.0 --> 4837.36
it's about that it doesn't you can't

4833.199 --> 4840.159
tell you can't tell

4837.36 --> 4842.0
they have to like go through puberty and

4840.159 --> 4845.12
then

4842.0 --> 4847.199
like the long-term care like social

4845.12 --> 4848.96
characteristics really come out that's

4847.199 --> 4850.638999999999
when you really start to see who they

4848.96 --> 4854.08
will become

4850.639 --> 4858.159000000001
right when they're really young preteen

4854.08 --> 4861.84
you you can't tell

4858.159 --> 4861.839999999999
you can't

4882.88 --> 4887.12
what percentage of dutch do you think

4884.719 --> 4889.84
can speak english like you

4887.12 --> 4889.84
a fair amount

4892.56 --> 4897.679
a lot of people still like my generation

4896.8 --> 4899.360000000001
still

4897.679 --> 4901.12
and before they speak pretty good

4899.36 --> 4904.0
english

4901.12 --> 4907.5199999999995
because english was always pretty

4904.0 --> 4907.52
important in schooling here

4909.6 --> 4913.4400000000005
a lot of languages are placed in high

4912.4 --> 4917.12
regard

4913.44 --> 4920.239
but yeah english there's a lot of people

4917.12 --> 4920.239
that speak english here

4922.96 --> 4928.639
i mean there

4926.159 --> 4930.879999999999
might not all be very good at it but

4928.639 --> 4933.1990000000005
they will get it because there's a lot

4930.88 --> 4937.52
there's always been a lot of english tv

4933.199 --> 4941.44
like we've had english tv with subtitles

4937.52 --> 4944.4800000000005
for a very long time it's only really

4941.44 --> 4947.678999999999
in the late 90s and beyond

4944.48 --> 4947.678999999999
that they started to

4947.92 --> 4955.04
like take all the cartoons and then have

4951.36 --> 4958.239
dutch spoken language

4955.04 --> 4959.44
to supplant the english spoken language

4958.239 --> 4963.04
right so

4959.44 --> 4963.04
they're undoing that ability

4966.4 --> 4973.12
so now everybody just speaks sjw dutch

4970.4 --> 4974.96
like that that's the [ __ ] that comes out

4973.12 --> 4976.159
now that's like the types of voice it's

4974.96 --> 4980.08
garbage

4976.159 --> 4987.839999999999
cartoons now is absolute atrocious

4980.08 --> 4987.84
garbage very damaging to the young mind

4990.8 --> 4997.12
right but i learned

4993.92 --> 4997.92
a lot from cartoons watching silly

4997.12 --> 5000.96
cartoons

4997.92 --> 5003.6
spoken in english or mostly american

5000.96 --> 5007.12
having dutch subtitles and the subtitles

5003.6 --> 5009.92
weren't even all that supremely done

5007.12 --> 5011.84
often it's just basic translators they

5009.92 --> 5013.679
didn't get every word

5011.84 --> 5016.0
sometimes sometimes you'd have like

5013.679 --> 5018.719
weird translation glitches and it's like

5016.0 --> 5020.56
okay that makes no sense

5018.719 --> 5022.56
what you just said like he couldn't

5020.56 --> 5023.04
figure out what was actually spoken in

5022.56 --> 5027.120000000001
the

5023.04 --> 5030.48
cartoon right but

5027.12 --> 5032.5599999999995
just the setup being like that really

5030.48 --> 5036.159
kept my mind busy

5032.56 --> 5038.719
constantly two languages the dutch

5036.159 --> 5039.679
roll out like there's somebody there

5038.719 --> 5042.2390000000005
saying it

5039.679 --> 5044.159
in dutch what is being said in english

5042.239 --> 5047.199
except without

5044.159 --> 5049.5199999999995
verb not verbal but visual

5047.199 --> 5050.879999999999
while it is english is being spoken so

5049.52 --> 5052.88
that way i

5050.88 --> 5055.04
annette started really young like when i

5052.88 --> 5057.84
was six

5055.04 --> 5059.12
i was that kid that is like ah i'm gonna

5057.84 --> 5061.12
saturday morning

5059.12 --> 5063.44
i'm gonna crawl out of my bed at seven

5061.12 --> 5064.96
o'clock gonna put my alarm clock i put

5063.44 --> 5067.44
it on that early for

5064.96 --> 5068.639
nothing else in the world but saturday

5067.44 --> 5071.839999999999
morning cartoons

5068.639 --> 5073.76
then i'd crawl out of my bed still sit

5071.84 --> 5074.32
in the dark in front of the television

5073.76 --> 5078.8
and just

5074.32 --> 5082.4
watch all that [ __ ] like all that sci-fi

5078.8 --> 5084.8
and oh robo-tech

5082.4 --> 5086.719
dude watching robo attack like when

5084.8 --> 5088.719
you're eight

5086.719 --> 5090.2390000000005
and that's actually like that is

5088.719 --> 5093.679
actually kind of a 12

5090.239 --> 5093.678999999999
plus cartoon

5093.84 --> 5100.08
huge huge impact

5097.04 --> 5104.48
right transformers of course

5100.08 --> 5107.199
other more forgotten cartoons

5104.48 --> 5108.879999999999
jason and the wild warriors thundercats

5107.199 --> 5110.839999999999
not so much forgotten

5108.88 --> 5113.84
those types of things that's what i

5110.84 --> 5113.84
watched

5113.92 --> 5127.84
like in between 1986

5119.12 --> 5127.84
and 1992.

5128.639 --> 5134.8
so yeah that setup is really what

5132.159 --> 5137.599999999999
got the mechanism going and that it

5134.8 --> 5137.6
always stayed

5138.96 --> 5145.84
i'm just bilingual bilingual that that's

5142.239 --> 5148.239
just how i am i can only do it with

5145.84 --> 5148.2390000000005
english

5152.08 --> 5158.8
but i do have the ability to understand

5155.36 --> 5158.799999999999
partially other languages

5158.96 --> 5162.8
it's more like just universal language

5161.84 --> 5169.84
understanding not

5162.8 --> 5169.84
really that language

5186.639 --> 5189.76
like being at english lessons

5188.4 --> 5192.96
permanently

5189.76 --> 5193.84
yeah i can imagine that sometimes people

5192.96 --> 5197.84
forget that i

5193.84 --> 5197.84
am actually dutch

5219.52 --> 5225.84
but yeah let's let's not do that

5232.639 --> 5239.84
but just to remind you yeah i actually

5234.8 --> 5239.84
do speak dutch

5251.04 --> 5255.36
does genuinely amaze me okay well return

5253.92 --> 5259.04
to normal in a way

5255.36 --> 5261.5199999999995
you know the dutch

5259.04 --> 5262.88
are and should be traditionally good at

5261.52 --> 5267.6
language

5262.88 --> 5272.8
like our very roots of our country

5267.6 --> 5275.84
existed on both banking ironically

5272.8 --> 5277.679
and trade and that means going

5275.84 --> 5279.52
literally around the world and trade

5277.679 --> 5282.4800000000005
with everything well guess what's

5279.52 --> 5284.4800000000005
really comes in handy when you go around

5282.48 --> 5287.599999999999
the world and trade with everybody

5284.48 --> 5289.5199999999995
being good at language so

5287.6 --> 5291.92
what better is what is better than to

5289.52 --> 5296.639
learn the language that is

5291.92 --> 5296.639
the most present everywhere

5297.679 --> 5305.92
right and even now

5302.0 --> 5307.84
now for like the last few decades

5305.92 --> 5308.96
there's been quite a few people in the

5307.84 --> 5312.159000000001
netherlands that even

5308.96 --> 5315.44
learned how to speak and write chinese

5312.159 --> 5317.679
i don't know how to do that but they

5315.44 --> 5319.5199999999995
some people out there do and they're

5317.679 --> 5321.76
they seem to be very good at i don't

5319.52 --> 5324.080000000001
know how to test how good they are

5321.76 --> 5325.1990000000005
but they seem to be very good at it

5324.08 --> 5328.8
right so dutch

5325.199 --> 5332.239
in average are kind of a language

5328.8 --> 5335.04
people they need that

5332.239 --> 5336.0
it's in their roots they have to be good

5335.04 --> 5339.76
at language

5336.0 --> 5339.76
to do what dutch people do

5346.08 --> 5350.639
oh there oh that's a difficult one

5349.92 --> 5352.4
clearly

5350.639 --> 5354.56
that's all very technical language

5352.4 --> 5355.36
that's difficult i'm better at technical

5354.56 --> 5358.96
language in

5355.36 --> 5364.4
english than in dutch but i could

5358.96 --> 5368.8
try it

5364.4 --> 5372.239
i jesus i don't even know like how to

5368.8 --> 5372.639
translate begging the question i mean i

5372.239 --> 5374.718999999999
could

5372.639 --> 5376.32
literally translate it but i know that

5374.719 --> 5378.639
would be incorrect

5376.32 --> 5381.28
because these are like academic

5378.639 --> 5392.159000000001
terminologies i don't know what it is in

5381.28 --> 5394.5599999999995
in dutch i literally have to google it

5392.159 --> 5394.5599999999995
oof

5395.52 --> 5399.4400000000005
okay i'll have to look up begging the

5397.36 --> 5402.799999999999
question and if i can figure out how to

5399.44 --> 5402.799999999999
properly say that in dutch

5404.84 --> 5410.639
then

5407.12 --> 5410.639
then i could probably do it

5411.28 --> 5414.5599999999995
oh god is it really that

5419.28 --> 5422.4
begging the question and fight us from

5421.76 --> 5426.96
spreaking

5422.4 --> 5431.36
our name yes which is translated

5426.96 --> 5431.36
to take effect for granted

5432.08 --> 5439.5199999999995
invite us from self speaking

5435.199 --> 5439.5199999999995
and neyman okay

5442.0 --> 5449.84
and fight us from spreading

5445.04 --> 5449.84
our name in the devices

5460.159 --> 5464.719
dammit what is curve it might just be

5462.32 --> 5464.719
the same

5464.84 --> 5469.43
[Applause]

5472.88 --> 5477.12
calculator wow

5489.44 --> 5498.0
that's it that's not quite fluid

5494.0 --> 5498.0
that doesn't really roll off the tongue

5499.28 --> 5504.0
but i managed to do it

5502.32 --> 5505.44
there might be even better ways of

5504.0 --> 5509.6
saying it

5505.44 --> 5509.599999999999
when putting some attention to it

5510.639 --> 5512.96
right

5514.08 --> 5516.639
so it's

5532.8 --> 5536.0
i hope you all got that

5536.4 --> 5550.579
you did good

5547.42 --> 5550.579
[Music]

5558.92 --> 5562.279
[Applause]

5562.8 --> 5567.84
let me see if there's even a better word

5564.639 --> 5567.84
for this oh coppin

5568.0 --> 5575.6
yeah sorry it's not on full it's coppin

5571.6 --> 5578.719
oh let me try again ooh refining this

5575.6 --> 5578.719
right so it's uh

5580.48 --> 5589.839999999999
oh damn it was it again

5614.84 --> 5617.84
hey

5624.08 --> 5627.28
that's cake ass is it

5627.36 --> 5631.839999999999
could you actually understand what i was

5629.44 --> 5631.839999999999
saying

5637.92 --> 5645.84
super califragilistic

5646.81 --> 5652.56
[Music]

5649.44 --> 5652.5599999999995
that's not a word

5652.719 --> 5659.84
not a real world i don't there's not a

5654.8 --> 5659.84
dutch version for that

5668.32 --> 5676.96
like what is even x pile lead

5673.52 --> 5680.639
never heard of that use

5676.96 --> 5686.32
like that literally means nothing

5680.639 --> 5691.04
no no nicole that's not a real world

5686.32 --> 5691.04
word no way

5695.92 --> 5699.679
are you questioning mary poppins yeah

5697.84 --> 5700.2390000000005
yeah mary poppins is a fictional

5699.679 --> 5702.8
character

5700.239 --> 5702.799999999999
yes i do

5705.6 --> 5710.56
ah yeah that is a real world

5709.4 --> 5712.839999999999
anti-disestablishmentarianism

5710.56 --> 5715.84
yes i know that word i've heard it

5712.84 --> 5715.84
before

5719.28 --> 5723.04
i'd have to look up part of that

5723.84 --> 5729.84
it is a really complicated word to

5726.84 --> 5729.84
translate

5739.04 --> 5743.84
and you spelled it wrong by the way

5750.239 --> 5756.5599999999995
that it just literally i i cheated i

5753.679 --> 5759.28
tried to literally google translate it

5756.56 --> 5762.400000000001
it's it just gives the same word it

5759.28 --> 5762.4
doesn't seem to be able to

5765.719 --> 5769.6
anti-disestablishmentarianism

5767.679 --> 5773.1990000000005
so i just have to pronounce it

5769.6 --> 5776.320000000001
differently it's literally the same word

5773.199 --> 5776.32
from what i've confined

5777.119 --> 5785.839999999999
yeah auntie disestablishmentarianism

5787.679 --> 5802.159
it's not a word we use commonly here

5798.96 --> 5813.199
oh hello one photo unit you had a

5802.159 --> 5816.5599999999995
correction from monday what is it

5813.199 --> 5819.678999999999
it is the oxford dictionary oh really so

5816.56 --> 5819.679
when do you use it

5820.8 --> 5824.88
you better be joking there's no way

5822.56 --> 5828.4800000000005
you're going to be saying

5824.88 --> 5833.32
that crazy word constantly

5828.48 --> 5835.919999999999
super califragilistic

5833.32 --> 5841.84
expia lidocious

5835.92 --> 5841.84
that's what this just for [ __ ]

5856.32 --> 5862.639
no no why would i say that

5859.84 --> 5862.639
it's just lame

5866.32 --> 5883.84
it's a mary poppins song yeah

5870.32 --> 5883.84
so not a word

5887.28 --> 5890.96
all right let me figure this out

5892.159 --> 5897.839999999999
let me find another way to actually life

5906.48 --> 5911.839999999999
[ __ ] [ __ ] off

5922.239 --> 5928.879999999999
and this is this establishment

5926.159 --> 5931.44
that's a very odd thing it's like very

5928.88 --> 5931.4400000000005
specific

5932.88 --> 5937.36
the action of removing a church or

5935.36 --> 5938.48
seminar organized group from its

5937.36 --> 5940.719
official position

5938.48 --> 5943.119
and no longer officially supporting it

5940.719 --> 5946.84
so it's kind of like

5943.119 --> 5948.32
cancel culture so

5946.84 --> 5951.119000000001
anti-disestablishmentarianism so it's

5948.32 --> 5955.199
basically anti-cancer culture

5951.119 --> 5959.04
it's a very very fancy official word

5955.199 --> 5959.04
for anti-cancer culture

5962.639 --> 5966.0
there's sort of cancer culture slightly

5965.119 --> 5971.759999999999
different it's more about

5966.0 --> 5971.76
words and people in history

5973.0 --> 5976.639
anti-disestablishmentarianism is more

5974.48 --> 5979.599999999999
about being against

5976.639 --> 5981.84
taking away functioning bodies for

5979.6 --> 5981.84
society

5988.0 --> 5998.639
it's supposed to be funny in english

5995.04 --> 6000.32
yeah no no no sorry i don't take

5998.639 --> 6003.4400000000005
requests for people

6000.32 --> 6006.48
with unidentified

6003.44 --> 6008.719
names that could literally be a sock

6006.48 --> 6010.799999999999
popping out of nowhere asking me to do

6008.719 --> 6014.56
[ __ ] no i don't do that

6010.8 --> 6017.1990000000005
yeah now if you would actually

6014.56 --> 6017.6
have a conversation with me and then ask

6017.199 --> 6019.36
it

6017.6 --> 6021.6
i might just consider it but if you're

6019.36 --> 6023.599999999999
gonna pop in just to make me say

6021.6 --> 6026.159000000001
something

6023.6 --> 6028.400000000001
that's not gonna work here i don't do

6026.159 --> 6028.4
that

6034.0 --> 6037.52
yeah it's like a double negative with

6035.44 --> 6042.08
the word yeah but that's the point right

6037.52 --> 6045.360000000001
because the disestablishment is

6042.08 --> 6050.08
the people that are taking away official

6045.36 --> 6052.239
functions like the church or whatever

6050.08 --> 6053.28
and if you're anti-that that means you

6052.239 --> 6055.759999999999
are against

6053.28 --> 6056.8
the cancelling of it so yes it should be

6055.76 --> 6058.400000000001
double

6056.8 --> 6060.88
it should be a double negative that's

6058.4 --> 6060.879999999999
the point

6061.6 --> 6079.280000000001
it's like you're being anti-anti

6065.04 --> 6082.719
that's the point of it

6079.28 --> 6085.44
yeah whatever it's real

6082.719 --> 6085.44
it's too bad

6088.56 --> 6092.2390000000005
i know that there's literally trolls out

6091.28 --> 6094.5599999999995
there that have

6092.239 --> 6095.678999999999
absolutely no life and that are

6094.56 --> 6098.88
desperate

6095.679 --> 6099.52
desperate beyond measure to find

6098.88 --> 6102.719
something

6099.52 --> 6105.52
permanently discrediting that they want

6102.719 --> 6106.4
to somehow use as a weight over me in

6105.52 --> 6109.119000000001
order to dev

6106.4 --> 6110.96
motivate me from continuing what i do

6109.119 --> 6111.679
and when i even have a hint of that

6110.96 --> 6114.2390000000005
sense

6111.679 --> 6116.159
i don't cooperate because i know you're

6114.239 --> 6119.199
literally trying to make me say

6116.159 --> 6120.48
things you can use as sound bites yeah i

6119.199 --> 6124.0
know it even when i go

6120.48 --> 6126.638999999999
full rage when i know it all i know

6124.0 --> 6129.119
you are trying to fabricate [ __ ] about

6126.639 --> 6132.159000000001
me i know you are

6129.119 --> 6135.44
right i'm not saying you in person

6132.159 --> 6138.4
it's just real

6135.44 --> 6139.04
but i don't know you so you could be one

6138.4 --> 6141.759999999999
of them

6139.04 --> 6142.32
and even if you weren't they are out

6141.76 --> 6145.360000000001
there

6142.32 --> 6148.159
i know i know you are i know

6145.36 --> 6149.5199999999995
you are sick gamma predators that are

6148.159 --> 6151.599999999999
obsessed

6149.52 --> 6153.6
with permanently destroying the

6151.6 --> 6156.88
character of anybody

6153.6 --> 6160.400000000001
that refuses to chronically

6156.88 --> 6163.84
lie for the beast i know i know you're

6160.4 --> 6163.839999999999
out there

6188.84 --> 6193.52
uh

6191.44 --> 6194.799999999999
yeah it's funny i bet it's funny it's

6193.52 --> 6197.84
also pointless

6194.8 --> 6205.84
and i don't i'm not gonna say it

6197.84 --> 6205.84
don't you google it

6227.92 --> 6235.28
huh okay one for a unit levasqui said

6232.96 --> 6237.04
satan who is the god of our planet and

6235.28 --> 6239.92
the only god

6237.04 --> 6241.5199999999995
well kabbalist you listen well what

6239.92 --> 6245.04
about

6241.52 --> 6248.320000000001
technically being correct

6245.04 --> 6251.92
satan is the only god of our

6248.32 --> 6255.759999999999
planet see

6251.92 --> 6259.52
because the planet is a lie

6255.76 --> 6262.96
now who is the ruler of lies

6259.52 --> 6265.52
satan she's merely stating a correct

6262.96 --> 6267.119
fact in your face and the people that

6265.52 --> 6269.1990000000005
think they are christians

6267.119 --> 6270.32
but can't even figure out the earth is

6269.199 --> 6272.239
not a globe

6270.32 --> 6273.679
they will be highly triggered oh they're

6272.239 --> 6276.239
trying to mess with me

6273.679 --> 6277.52
yeah or you're just unwilling to

6276.239 --> 6280.159
relinquish

6277.52 --> 6280.639
that she's literally speaking the truth

6280.159 --> 6284.799999999999
there

6280.639 --> 6284.8
in a trick setup ah

6284.88 --> 6291.28
oh it's all a cult or you just don't

6287.76 --> 6291.280000000001
understand what she actually said

6295.199 --> 6299.599999999999
or he or she what is it blavoski or

6297.199 --> 6299.599999999999
whatever

6299.92 --> 6308.56
satan is the only god of the globe

6304.0 --> 6310.719
that's right because the globe is a lie

6308.56 --> 6313.52
and there's only one spirit that has

6310.719 --> 6316.88
domain over lies

6313.52 --> 6318.159000000001
and that's satan it is the spirit of

6316.88 --> 6331.84
lies

6318.159 --> 6331.839999999999
it is lies god is truth satan is lies

6332.159 --> 6338.32
but it's it's not just the deceiver this

6335.679 --> 6341.36
even no it's about the domain

6338.32 --> 6345.28
now if somebody says the domain of

6341.36 --> 6348.799999999999
the planet earth

6345.28 --> 6349.199
that's literally presupposing the planet

6348.8 --> 6352.08
earth

6349.199 --> 6353.759999999999
immediately in there it's just saying

6352.08 --> 6356.639
yeah

6353.76 --> 6357.679
satan is the god of planet earth because

6356.639 --> 6359.92
planet earth

6357.679 --> 6361.84
is [ __ ] and you should know that and

6359.92 --> 6362.639
if you don't you're gonna be very

6361.84 --> 6365.84
confused

6362.639 --> 6369.04
and scared of what i just said

6365.84 --> 6372.639
that's a satanist [ __ ] with you

6369.04 --> 6387.84
huh [ __ ] with your spells

6372.639 --> 6387.84
that you can see through huh

6391.76 --> 6395.92
no one for you i don't i don't know i

6393.76 --> 6399.4400000000005
don't care

6395.92 --> 6401.6
i don't care who sees what god is what

6399.44 --> 6404.159
lucifer was i don't give a [ __ ] about

6401.6 --> 6404.159000000001
any of that

6404.56 --> 6408.96
right there's been a lot of weird ideas

6407.04 --> 6412.239
and

6408.96 --> 6415.84
about what god supposedly is

6412.239 --> 6415.839999999999
from all kinds of groups

6425.44 --> 6430.0
and every time somebody brings up

6427.119 --> 6433.599999999999
lucifer lucifer has

6430.0 --> 6433.6
too much of a varied

6434.239 --> 6441.36
meaning too much

6437.84 --> 6444.159000000001
too many meanings lucifer is too wide

6441.36 --> 6444.88
right satan is pretty clear what it

6444.159 --> 6448.96
stands for

6444.88 --> 6453.36
lucifer is light and it's the light that

6448.96 --> 6453.36
also burns it's the seduction it's

6453.679 --> 6457.84
the one that will proceed in a way

6461.6 --> 6466.320000000001
right in a way you could say like all

6464.159 --> 6467.679
the development goes in the footsteps of

6466.32 --> 6470.719
lucifer

6467.679 --> 6473.6
because he's always on the front

6470.719 --> 6475.679
doing [ __ ] developing introducing new

6473.6 --> 6478.4800000000005
things that change everything

6475.679 --> 6480.0
yeah that's also lucifer so yeah there's

6478.48 --> 6482.638999999999
a point to saying like

6480.0 --> 6485.92
lucifer is the god of this world yeah

6482.639 --> 6488.08
well from a certain perspective

6485.92 --> 6489.1990000000005
in an esoteric sense yeah you could make

6488.08 --> 6491.04
that statement

6489.199 --> 6493.199
now if you're immediately going to

6491.04 --> 6495.28
squirt all over that and make a statue

6493.199 --> 6497.5199999999995
of him and then say oh that means that

6495.28 --> 6499.759999999999
everything else is alive

6497.52 --> 6502.080000000001
yeah yeah then you just become another

6499.76 --> 6503.52
[ __ ] with a religious obsession

6502.08 --> 6506.8
against god

6503.52 --> 6510.400000000001
against creation in itself yeah

6506.8 --> 6511.76
when somebody says like yeah lucifer

6510.4 --> 6514.0
you got to figure out what they're

6511.76 --> 6514.88
actually meaning when they say that and

6514.0 --> 6517.76
not just like

6514.88 --> 6518.9800000000005
oh he said lucifer oh no that means

6517.76 --> 6520.639
satan

6518.98 --> 6524.239
[Music]

6520.639 --> 6528.0
don't [ __ ] your pants every time

6524.239 --> 6531.04
somebody drops a word okay

6528.0 --> 6534.48
stop giving in

6531.04 --> 6537.679
to the [ __ ] your pants reflex

6534.48 --> 6540.239
in the response to words

6537.679 --> 6542.08
try to figure out what they're actually

6540.239 --> 6555.839999999999
saying

6542.08 --> 6555.84
feel it rather than hear it

6558.56 --> 6564.719
no satan or lucifer not the same

6561.679 --> 6565.1990000000005
no george sanford absolutely not the

6564.719 --> 6568.08
same

6565.199 --> 6570.159
satan and lucifer are not the same satan

6568.08 --> 6574.719
and lucifer are not the same

6570.159 --> 6578.08
in every aspect they are not the same

6574.719 --> 6582.56
satan is a beast lucifer

6578.08 --> 6585.599
is an angel fallen one satan is a spirit

6582.56 --> 6585.599
lucifer is

6586.4 --> 6591.92
is like a real is it's

6589.52 --> 6592.88
different it's everything is different

6591.92 --> 6597.52
about them

6592.88 --> 6600.8
they're not the same

6597.52 --> 6603.599
like satan isn't even a conscious spirit

6600.8 --> 6605.28
lucifer is like a conscious spirit satan

6603.599 --> 6608.0
is the spirit that is in

6605.28 --> 6609.04
all of us it is what happens when we

6608.0 --> 6613.199
slide down

6609.04 --> 6616.4
the baser instincts the earthly

6613.199 --> 6618.799999999999
the mindless coming together lucifer is

6616.4 --> 6622.839999999999
none of that

6618.8 --> 6626.639
lucifer is arrogant lucifer

6622.84 --> 6630.0
is sharp

6626.639 --> 6633.4400000000005
and also wild foolish

6630.0 --> 6635.92
risky old everything different

6633.44 --> 6637.28
everything between satan and lucifer is

6635.92 --> 6640.4
different esoterically

6637.28 --> 6644.08
it's completely different

6640.4 --> 6646.32
yeah and even

6644.08 --> 6647.199
people like rudolf steiner recognized

6646.32 --> 6650.96
that and

6647.199 --> 6652.32
designated it as two extremely important

6650.96 --> 6656.639
esoteric elements

6652.32 --> 6659.84
and that is lucifer the seducer

6656.639 --> 6662.159000000001
ahriman he used another word for it

6659.84 --> 6664.32
called it iremon

6662.159 --> 6666.0
and both could be considered in the

6664.32 --> 6669.759999999999
realm of satan

6666.0 --> 6673.199
the liars right

6669.76 --> 6675.119000000001
iroman is death is everything that leads

6673.199 --> 6678.5599999999995
to death depression

6675.119 --> 6678.5599999999995
rage destruction

6678.88 --> 6684.0
mental dislocation turning yourself off

6682.239 --> 6686.48
turning your consciousness off

6684.0 --> 6689.04
decreasing lucifer is

6686.48 --> 6690.959999999999
burning up it's like oh you can do

6689.04 --> 6691.76
anything oh you can disconnect from god

6690.96 --> 6694.96
oh

6691.76 --> 6698.159000000001
you're more you're worth more and

6694.96 --> 6700.4800000000005
eventually you snap because you're human

6698.159 --> 6702.32
you have a balance and lucifer always

6700.48 --> 6703.36
draws you out of the balance through the

6702.32 --> 6705.92
seductions

6703.36 --> 6708.639
and then eventually you snap and then

6705.92 --> 6711.76
ariemon takes over

6708.639 --> 6714.719
he always distinctly mentions that

6711.76 --> 6714.719
because it's true

6714.96 --> 6722.159
satan and lucifer are completely

6718.32 --> 6722.96
different esoterically they're not the

6722.159 --> 6727.04
same

6722.96 --> 6729.76
