oh yeah I think I'm gonna unblock a GM I

164.63 --> 172.43
kind of want to do it before it dislike

167.489 --> 172.43
I hope he's back under control you know

173.03 --> 178.829
guys so undisciplined but it does make

177.12 --> 183.889
me feel guilty for keeping him blocked

178.829 --> 183.889
too long so I'm gonna do that

186.5 --> 191.34
and at least after I bend his secondary

189.63 --> 193.79999999999998
account yesterday he didn't come back

191.34 --> 196.19
and I kind of appreciated that he took

193.8 --> 196.19
the hint

206.54 --> 211.209
hold on Justin it's gonna take a minute

221.51 --> 227.73
anyway yes sorry I should have done this

223.98 --> 230.19
before the show I'll try to talk as I

227.73 --> 240.41
searched for him in the giant list of

230.19 --> 240.41
banned people AJ yeah where is he

245.45 --> 251.79999999999998
the system is so clumsy right there he

250.459 --> 256.419
is

251.8 --> 260.41
okay that was quick

256.419 --> 263.63
sometimes it takes me like half an hour

260.41 --> 266.69
but yeah he's unlucky I don't know if

263.63 --> 268.19
he's here but we'll see anyway it

266.69 --> 271.04
doesn't mean that he's gonna get a free

268.19 --> 273.86
rein now it's just I'm opening up the

271.04 --> 275.72
shed door and letting him come out take

273.86 --> 277.49
a breather if he's gonna do the same

275.72 --> 284.56
thing he's gonna go straight back into

277.49 --> 284.56
the [ __ ] mm-hmm right hey unicorn Slayer

289.9 --> 297.78999999999996
yeah I kept up yesterday very late but

294.53 --> 301.34
yeah it was hard to break away hmm

297.79 --> 305.54
especially because the second Owen

301.34 --> 311.39
Benjamin hang out very late Wow when I'm

305.54 --> 316.49
pretty long and it's just so great he

311.39 --> 319.31
went on about a cue and he was and the

316.49 --> 321.32
coronavirus issues and I loved it

319.31 --> 323.419
because he was right he was really

321.32 --> 325.28
trying to get this oversight dig into

323.419 --> 329.0
what that was and then see how the old

325.28 --> 334.13
people responding yeah The Cure's seems

329.0 --> 336.14
to be almost a bit savonia like and it's

334.13 --> 337.55
so fascinating by now because Owen

336.14 --> 341.87
Benjamin has built up just this

337.55 --> 344.75
repertoire of descriptive terminologies

341.87 --> 349.43
you could almost make it like a big bear

344.75 --> 351.95
dictionary out of it that yeah you teach

349.43 --> 354.74
like with the school board and all that

351.95 --> 355.76
the bear standing next to a school board

354.74 --> 359.14
just pointing out all these

355.76 --> 364.84999999999997
terminologies like the grappler and the

359.14 --> 367.90999999999997
jewnicorn and cellphone yay and and all

364.85 --> 370.0
these all these types of character

367.91 --> 373.06
descriptions

370.0 --> 375.76
and then try to make a bigger picture

373.06 --> 379.39
with it like in a framework that could

375.76 --> 380.86
be fascinating because I like to use his

379.39 --> 383.74
terminologies because they're just so

380.86 --> 388.41
good and they're funny they're not

383.74 --> 388.41
really malevolent in any way

395.92 --> 400.27000000000004
okay let's see what you are talking

397.85 --> 400.27000000000004
about

411.98 --> 420.35
all right another fan personally oh

413.93 --> 423.05
that's fine you know I I have criticism

420.35 --> 425.24
even yeah it's like hey if you want to

423.05 --> 427.37
be nitpicky oh I can be freaking

425.24 --> 430.88
nitpicky but yeah as soon as I go there

427.37 --> 433.31
it just pisses off everyone but sure Big

430.88 --> 437.63
Bear has flaws oh yes

433.31 --> 439.19
and not just like his decision-making or

437.63 --> 442.19
something which is pretty good

439.19 --> 444.86
really pretty sensible very logos driven

442.19 --> 453.65
and I appreciate that but yeah it just

444.86 --> 455.24
he's a man man have flaws and it's not

453.65 --> 459.16999999999996
it's gonna rub some people the wrong way

455.24 --> 462.56
and some yeah his jokes are pretty

459.17 --> 465.49
extreme and in a way meant to trigger

462.56 --> 467.54
but then defuse the trigger and

465.49 --> 473.51
sometimes that just doesn't work with

467.54 --> 475.73
people but it works with me because I

473.51 --> 477.34999999999997
really appreciate that I have a lot of

475.73 --> 481.97
frustration with a lot of things in the

477.35 --> 486.05
world and just his comedy such a breath

481.97 --> 488.69000000000005
of fresh air to me every time it gives

486.05 --> 492.14
me a lot of room to think he helps me

488.69 --> 495.83
clean up the war eats the war is up

492.14 --> 497.69
there clears things up and I tried to do

495.83 --> 499.84999999999997
the same thing in my own way except I

497.69 --> 502.25
guess I don't focus so much on comedy

499.85 --> 505.33000000000004
myself even though I I do make jokes

502.25 --> 513.5
every now and then if they just pop up

505.33 --> 518.3
yeah but yeah the great stream great

513.5 --> 520.94
gravy and it was kind of funny in a way

518.3 --> 524.15
because he eventually started to talk

520.94 --> 526.9100000000001
about like ah I'm like I'm getting gravy

524.15 --> 528.7099999999999
overkill it's like almost like he was

526.91 --> 531.3199999999999
just starting to hallucinate from all

528.71 --> 534.59
the energy you can really see it it was

531.32 --> 537.44
like oh so many ideas and like all the

534.59 --> 539.5400000000001
responses and like oh you could see that

537.44 --> 542.86
like he was looking at jet and just what

539.54 --> 544.9
people were saying were inspiring like

542.86 --> 548.51
like

544.9 --> 550.34
one project every two seconds in his

548.51 --> 552.35
minding just couldn't handle all the

550.34 --> 557.11
ideas that were popping into his mind I

552.35 --> 564.88
just could it was it was quite bizarre

557.11 --> 564.88
but yeah it was good to be there

578.58 --> 585.019
oh really Walter would you do that no

585.5 --> 590.6
that's

586.8 --> 593.04
I wouldn't recommend it to you buddy I

590.6 --> 595.8290000000001
don't know if you realized but own

593.04 --> 599.9399999999999
Benjamin is a big freakin guy and he's

595.829 --> 603.5
strong okay and he doesn't take [ __ ] I

599.94 --> 607.4300000000001
really wouldn't recommend doing that

603.5 --> 607.43
it's gonna hurt a lot

617.55 --> 620.55
yeah

620.73 --> 627.13
so yeah for all the bluster and all that

623.58 --> 628.6
it's you don't get it if you get all

627.13 --> 639.79
triggered and you want to fight him then

628.6 --> 642.64
you just don't get it it's yeah that's

639.79 --> 645.27
the best I can give you you just don't

642.64 --> 645.27
get it sorry

645.51 --> 651.88
and hey if you just don't like him then

648.94 --> 654.9100000000001
leave it you know I don't constantly

651.88 --> 659.14
talk in worship about own Benjamin all

654.91 --> 662.65
the time it's just I do mention him

659.14 --> 665.4399999999999
especially because it's good to me and

662.65 --> 667.75
hey I do talk about myself and what I do

665.44 --> 670.9300000000001
it's just like this is kind of my life

667.75 --> 674.26
Journal on YouTube in a bit you know in

670.93 --> 679.18
a way and of course just the discussion

674.26 --> 682.0
room and technicals and all that so yeah

679.18 --> 684.25
hey I watch Owen Benjamin lot so I'm

682.0 --> 686.33
gonna mention him I'm gonna give him

684.25 --> 691.909
credit

686.33 --> 691.909
[Music]

695.79 --> 707.019
keyboard warrior what

701.44 --> 711.94
well is this am i getting some triggered

707.019 --> 717.43
leftovers from the whole cue scuffle

711.94 --> 723.4490000000001
over at Owen Benjamin's yet is this a a

717.43 --> 730.2399999999999
a Q Big Bear scuffle backlash troll

723.449 --> 732.399
invasion ow is that what you are you

730.24 --> 735.67
guys never can leave things lone Canyon

732.399 --> 737.98
it's just you don't know how to back

735.67 --> 745.209
down even if it would save your life

737.98 --> 750.939
would it I guess I guess it's it's a

745.209 --> 752.7689999999999
cultural problem on a wider scale anyway

750.939 --> 757.209
yeah there were some weird experiences

752.769 --> 759.55
yesterday which Thanks thankfully I was

757.209 --> 762.069
able to explain afterward but it just

759.55 --> 767.889
weirded me out when that happened so I

762.069 --> 771.069
was just watching videos playing games

767.889 --> 774.25
and usual at 8 o'clock then I went

771.069 --> 780.459
outside because suddenly I was hearing

774.25 --> 784.779
all this like crowd applause and like

780.459 --> 787.2689999999999
yeah yeah it was like what so I walked

784.779 --> 789.459
outside and there were literally like

787.269 --> 792.85
people standing right there pretty much

789.459 --> 796.1199999999999
facing me woman in a wheelchair like

792.85 --> 799.3000000000001
yeah yeah and like I could hear over

796.12 --> 802.3
there like a lot of people that was like

799.3 --> 806.49
freaking surreal man I was like what how

802.3 --> 808.269
is this why are they clapping for me ah

806.49 --> 809.92
no that can't be

808.269 --> 812.949
what's going on I checked the news

809.92 --> 816.88
nothing and then much much later

812.949 --> 820.059
yeah they applauded and they were kind

816.88 --> 823.809
of facing me but the in retrospect that

820.059 --> 828.519
seemed like a just surreal mistake but

823.809 --> 832.23
my count it's just like yeah I you know

828.519 --> 834.18
I I get weirded out by odd things

832.23 --> 837.21
sometimes and this this was one of them

834.18 --> 840.2099999999999
so this was at 8 o'clock and it lasted

837.21 --> 846.8100000000001
for like three or five minutes they were

840.21 --> 847.38
like and kind of freaked me out and yeah

846.81 --> 850.38
later

847.38 --> 852.18
I I was able to figure out that I was

850.38 --> 855.03
I literally just asked a question why

852.18 --> 857.0699999999999
did people clap at eight o'clock in the

855.03 --> 859.23
Netherlands this in this day is that

857.07 --> 861.36
just like that and there was actually a

859.23 --> 863.22
news article about that and apparently

861.36 --> 868.6800000000001
on social media there was this action

863.22 --> 872.19
this is so Dutch it's goodwill it is

868.68 --> 876.3499999999999
Dutch right so okay do they all on

872.19 --> 881.4000000000001
social media greed okay to encourage

876.35 --> 884.16
goodwill we're gonna applaud the the

881.4 --> 886.56
health workers the nurses to do with the

884.16 --> 889.17
coronavirus and and yeah they did it

886.56 --> 892.17
it's so Dutch but I didn't know that was

889.17 --> 894.06
going on so I just walked like what why

892.17 --> 896.5799999999999
and they've just happened to kind of

894.06 --> 899.1899999999999
face me and in or Surya was almost like

896.58 --> 901.62
I thought for a moment like I was pulled

899.19 --> 905.22
into the dark world and there was like

901.62 --> 907.2
something really loosen Ettore go is if

905.22 --> 911.27
you know what I mean it was really

907.2 --> 915.23
freaky but yeah it was just a thing

911.27 --> 915.23
retrospect it's kind of funny

919.65 --> 926.67
but yeah social media things it's like

923.45 --> 928.26
the hive thing that there's a lot of

926.67 --> 930.39
activity in social media like

928.26 --> 933.27
everybody's on it and they have this

930.39 --> 935.25
thing like is oh let's do this let's do

933.27 --> 938.16
something together let's do something

935.25 --> 940.98
good it's almost like like a

938.16 --> 943.29
kindergarten effect on social media and

940.98 --> 947.46
people just start to do that and then

943.29 --> 952.4699999999999
it's like oh yeah and then everybody or

947.46 --> 955.6800000000001
a lot of people do that and I've seen

952.47 --> 957.69
that kind of thing before flash mob yeah

955.68 --> 959.9699999999999
but there's no there was no parade or

957.69 --> 966.95
anything just people walked outside and

959.97 --> 970.83
we're like yay yay it was odd what okay

966.95 --> 973.4300000000001
so that kind of happened at 8 o'clock in

970.83 --> 976.47
the evening yesterday I was weird

973.43 --> 976.4699999999999
[Music]

980.89 --> 991.16
right it is fine each but on the other

984.59 --> 993.1700000000001
hand it is it is still goodwill so you

991.16 --> 995.7199999999999
can't really say like Oh roof is so

993.17 --> 998.8389999999999
stupid so bad no it's good wheel so it's

995.72 --> 1003.48
nothing really wrong with it but it is

998.839 --> 1010.33
very typical it's very telling I think

1003.48 --> 1012.73
that the Dutch do this a lot and I guess

1010.33 --> 1015.1
that it is also kind of being encouraged

1012.73 --> 1017.6800000000001
through this through the media it's like

1015.1 --> 1031.0
top-down they do encourage this kind of

1017.68 --> 1034.54
thing it has also kind of been a

1031.0 --> 1038.62
mechanism to try and basically scare

1034.54 --> 1040.089
people from the left-wing because they

1038.62 --> 1044.35
also do this kind of thing sometimes

1040.089 --> 1047.02
with environmental issues or I don't

1044.35 --> 1052.84
know they're also very Pro gay parade

1047.02 --> 1056.26
and all that it's just so it's it is

1052.84 --> 1058.51
what it is I don't necessarily I'm not

1056.26 --> 1062.35
saying that everybody agrees it's just

1058.51 --> 1064.12
that it is that - mentality and it's

1062.35 --> 1066.6699999999998
really being Curt it has been for a long

1064.12 --> 1070.6599999999999
time and it there is something to it

1066.67 --> 1073.03
there is a it does bring some kind of a

1070.66 --> 1078.0600000000002
peacefulness and a sense of coherence

1073.03 --> 1078.06
you know there's not a lot of like earth

1080.01 --> 1084.67
there's no open aggression or

1082.45 --> 1087.07
competitive spirit a lot at least in

1084.67 --> 1090.179
this neighborhood in the city overall

1087.07 --> 1093.73
III gonna see that a lot maybe and like

1090.179 --> 1095.89
bad neighborhoods still have that but I

1093.73 --> 1098.95
think that even that is not even that

1095.89 --> 1101.0200000000002
bad compared to for example out

1098.95 --> 1103.56
sometimes is in the u.s. a certain

1101.02 --> 1103.56
regions

1110.11 --> 1117.8899999999999
anyway let's move on to another subject

1113.11 --> 1120.4089999999999
I get an odd reports it's another car

1117.89 --> 1123.1100000000001
owner news and I don't know what to make

1120.409 --> 1126.3500000000001
of this guys I literally I'm just gonna

1123.11 --> 1131.539
stop mention it because at this point

1126.35 --> 1139.25
it's just like what really is this could

1131.539 --> 1143.929
I don't know I saw it on RT and it it

1139.25 --> 1147.11
doesn't even mention who wrote it it's

1143.929 --> 1150.0800000000002
just a piece of text but apparent its

1147.11 --> 1153.7099999999998
stating that a coronavirus deaths in

1150.08 --> 1157.51
europe surpassed that yeah apparently in

1153.71 --> 1157.51
italy it's now so bad

1157.6 --> 1171.98
3421 but it's right really what are the

1167.059 --> 1174.59
yeah it's just it seems also arbitrary

1171.98 --> 1177.159
to me it's almost like a an economic

1174.59 --> 1180.26
game it's overt I don't know it it

1177.159 --> 1183.38
really did all these people dive what

1180.26 --> 1185.929
were the circumstances like or there was

1183.38 --> 1188.69
it like a or there a lot of elderly that

1185.929 --> 1192.6200000000001
just suddenly all died or what the

1188.69 --> 1197.48
hell's going on really was this in five

1192.62 --> 1199.34
G cities I still want to know if there's

1197.48 --> 1202.82
how strong there's a correlation between

1199.34 --> 1206.11
that you know because there a lot of

1202.82 --> 1210.74
five G installations have been kind of

1206.11 --> 1213.9189999999999
installed in certain type of cities

1210.74 --> 1216.86
around the world and I just want to know

1213.919 --> 1219.1390000000001
I just want to know I want to see the

1216.86 --> 1223.789
map where that where they're installed

1219.139 --> 1227.149
and then I want to see the outbreak and

1223.789 --> 1228.799
depth map supposedly of the Quran over I

1227.149 --> 1231.7099999999998
want to see if there is a strong

1228.799 --> 1235.76
correlation I really do and then maybe

1231.71 --> 1237.82
also important size up like are the

1235.76 --> 1241.039
numbers actively being suppressed or

1237.82 --> 1243.72
aggravated yeah a blow overblown

1241.039 --> 1246.36
like that would have to be determined on

1243.72 --> 1249.83
top of just that overlay of the map

1246.36 --> 1254.52
because I think that every city or

1249.83 --> 1256.47
nation may have their own type not only

1254.52 --> 1258.98
the technical response like what their

1256.47 --> 1262.6490000000001
day doing but also like the attitude of

1258.98 --> 1266.19
are they're gonna hype it up or tone it

1262.649 --> 1268.35
down or just say it as is like that is

1266.19 --> 1273.0
another layer in between that you don't

1268.35 --> 1283.86
really get to see you got to figure it

1273.0 --> 1285.2
out for yourself anyway so I yeah I saw

1283.86 --> 1291.08
that

1285.2 --> 1291.0800000000002
kroehner news hey I don't really know

1296.72 --> 1305.72
right for any took the usual death rate

1299.3 --> 1309.32
did yeah that's exactly so typically if

1305.72 --> 1312.74
there is a lot of elderly people that

1309.32 --> 1317.26
are kind of in that age category where

1312.74 --> 1320.27
they risk dying from the flu and such

1317.26 --> 1323.39
that is very telling like they could

1320.27 --> 1326.83
literally just be dropping the corona

1323.39 --> 1326.8300000000002
numbers on top of that

1335.45 --> 1342.77
you know if they really wanted to amp up

1338.11 --> 1345.77
in wine to hype up the corona then they

1342.77 --> 1348.17
could go as far as simple as and this is

1345.77 --> 1350.09
I'm not saying anybody is literally

1348.17 --> 1353.3600000000001
doing I just say they could they could

1350.09 --> 1355.22
be doing it just like oh okay somebody

1353.36 --> 1358.25
died okay

1355.22 --> 1361.64
we're just gonna declare it died they

1358.25 --> 1365.39
died from Corona just like my oh they do

1361.64 --> 1367.94
died from Corona just like that another

1365.39 --> 1369.8600000000001
number on the stat even though they just

1367.94 --> 1373.43
I don't know died of heart attack or

1369.86 --> 1376.1599999999999
just died in their sleep very old or you

1373.43 --> 1380.0600000000002
know that is a possibility that that

1376.16 --> 1383.42
could be happening I'm not pointing any

1380.06 --> 1386.11
fingers though just saying that should

1383.42 --> 1386.1100000000001
be kept in mind

1394.85 --> 1398.51
[Music]

1402.69 --> 1409.419
all right it's the cheapest way to get a

1405.49 --> 1411.22
lot of Corona stats you just pointed

1409.419 --> 1413.0800000000002
them and say yeah they died a corona and

1411.22 --> 1419.02
you know need any tests no extra cost

1413.08 --> 1423.25
it's just pointing a finger crossing the

1419.02 --> 1428.52
V mark and it's done and you got your

1423.25 --> 1428.52
Corona stats see

1428.97 --> 1433.51
[Music]

1436.42 --> 1444.5500000000002
really Steve everyone everyone in the UK

1440.74 --> 1446.49
Airport should be tested oh that's just

1444.55 --> 1450.6699999999998
great man

1446.49 --> 1452.95
can you imagine I think that the flight

1450.67 --> 1454.51
companies wouldn't go bust very quickly

1452.95 --> 1455.56
if that happened people would just not

1454.51 --> 1459.31
do it anymore

1455.56 --> 1460.59
I don't have time for that it's not that

1459.31 --> 1463.12
quick

1460.59 --> 1465.85
although yeah and on the other hand it

1463.12 --> 1468.34
could then just you could move the bar

1465.85 --> 1470.6499999999999
under these circumstances just say okay

1468.34 --> 1474.97
if you got the flu if you even got a

1470.65 --> 1477.52
cold you got any amount of viruses

1474.97 --> 1480.6100000000001
whatever yeah you don't get on flights

1477.52 --> 1484.84
it could be as simple as that and then I

1480.61 --> 1487.9299999999998
guess it would be more of an airport

1484.84 --> 1489.6399999999999
entry Jack kind of thing not the waiting

1487.93 --> 1492.28
in line for the airplanes and all that

1489.64 --> 1494.0800000000002
because yeah if you if you potentially

1492.28 --> 1497.11
have anything and you're waiting in the

1494.08 --> 1500.8899999999999
airport that open space yeah that's not

1497.11 --> 1508.32
good if you think that viruses are that

1500.89 --> 1511.0900000000001
dangerous and all that so I don't know

1508.32 --> 1515.5
the funny thing is that there is like

1511.09 --> 1518.11
this mechanical thing to this whole

1515.5 --> 1521.56
situation that have has kind of caught

1518.11 --> 1523.4699999999998
my attention and it's like made me get a

1521.56 --> 1526.6
little creative in the mind like okay

1523.47 --> 1529.56
let's just presuppose that all this

1526.6 --> 1533.07
dangerous stuff is really what it is

1529.56 --> 1539.98
what could you do about it how could you

1533.07 --> 1543.07
cheaply alter setups of stores Jack

1539.98 --> 1545.2
points all that to kind of account for

1543.07 --> 1548.1699999999998
this to like okay there is a virus

1545.2 --> 1551.98
danger you switch okay bring out the

1548.17 --> 1553.99
special door like you're just almost

1551.98 --> 1556.21
like a transformer switch to the other

1553.99 --> 1558.34
setting and then when the dangers over

1556.21 --> 1561.1000000000001
click you switch back and it's back to

1558.34 --> 1564.07
the normal way of business and then

1561.1 --> 1567.4499999999998
there would not have to be economic

1564.07 --> 1569.37
losses to the same degree see

1567.45 --> 1572.6100000000001
I'd like I don't know I'm just I like

1569.37 --> 1576.84
being creative maybe I'm getting caught

1572.61 --> 1579.4199999999998
in presuppositions here I have this

1576.84 --> 1582.53
tendency sometimes same goes for a globe

1579.42 --> 1582.53
cosmology and all that

1585.4 --> 1591.0890000000002
[Music]

1597.179 --> 1599.749
yeah

1606.99 --> 1615.81
well Tom Parker look it's licking

1612.22 --> 1618.04
envelopes I think that if somebody has

1615.81 --> 1619.54
sickness they're not gonna send out a

1618.04 --> 1624.24
lot of ávila and they're not gonna like

1619.54 --> 1626.71
go to work and then do like post

1624.24 --> 1628.78
registry stuff and sending out mail

1626.71 --> 1632.7
they're not gonna lick envelopes as they

1628.78 --> 1632.7
are sick that makes no sense

1636.0 --> 1641.41
[Music]

1655.77 --> 1666.76
what about if they don't know they have

1657.91 --> 1673.5700000000002
it yet yeah yeah well I don't know I

1666.76 --> 1674.83
guess that you could do it a instead of

1673.57 --> 1678.3999999999999
licking envelopes there are other ways

1674.83 --> 1680.9499999999998
to do it you know you just take a like

1678.4 --> 1685.96
certain type of rolling sponge a little

1680.95 --> 1686.8
water you just you could do it that way

1685.96 --> 1690.64
you know

1686.8 --> 1693.04
and besides licking and I haven't I

1690.64 --> 1695.3500000000001
haven't really seen licking envelopes in

1693.04 --> 1697.3899999999999
a while what I have seen however are

1695.35 --> 1700.9289999999999
these envelopes that basically have

1697.39 --> 1704.2
stickers on them so instead of licking

1700.929 --> 1707.679
some side it's a sticker you take off

1704.2 --> 1713.19
the sticker protector and you just close

1707.679 --> 1713.19
it so that's problem solved really

1718.29 --> 1721.45
[Music]

1722.34 --> 1735.4289999999999
no don't pork I don't think people do

1724.99 --> 1741.49
this [ __ ] I don't think so well then sir

1735.429 --> 1742.659
Falcon that's your business I don't

1741.49 --> 1746.59
really care that much

1742.659 --> 1749.3090000000002
look I'm just giving technical I'm just

1746.59 --> 1754.1789999999999
pumping out technical solutions for a

1749.309 --> 1757.51
preset positional based scenario that is

1754.179 --> 1760.299
unfolding right now okay that's all I

1757.51 --> 1762.519
eat I'm not gonna panic over this I'm

1760.299 --> 1765.22
not gonna be oh no they're gonna they're

1762.519 --> 1768.94
gonna spread it in purpose oh yeah okay

1765.22 --> 1771.549
kuru yeah I I don't really care that

1768.94 --> 1773.559
much it makes no sense the more you

1771.549 --> 1775.48
panic over that the more you're gonna

1773.559 --> 1780.549
aggravate things any way for yourself

1775.48 --> 1788.32
for your condition and people may just I

1780.549 --> 1790.45
don't know be so repulsed by how fear

1788.32 --> 1794.49
poorni some people get that it might

1790.45 --> 1797.169
just joke about that just trigger people

1794.49 --> 1800.86
you know there's a lot of that out there

1797.169 --> 1803.6390000000001
so don't spiral over these things it is

1800.86 --> 1808.1789999999999
stupid like what is the deal anyway

1803.639 --> 1810.07
remember it is supposedly less dangerous

1808.179 --> 1814.5700000000002
than the flu whatever they say about it

1810.07 --> 1817.96
right so even if it if spread even if

1814.57 --> 1822.039
you did get it you know it's not really

1817.96 --> 1824.559
that big of a deal it is for yeah it is

1822.039 --> 1827.62
for the elderly and all that the people

1824.559 --> 1831.8799999999999
in less health that's true but on

1827.62 --> 1835.33
average just like the general flu you

1831.88 --> 1837.6100000000001
know that also is just simply going out

1835.33 --> 1840.309
and spreading people are not aren't

1837.61 --> 1846.789
panicking over that yet people still die

1840.309 --> 1849.4289999999999
from that even right now you know in the

1846.789 --> 1852.399
flu season people are literally dying of

1849.429 --> 1854.5300000000002
regular flu right now all across the

1852.399 --> 1860.6799999999998
world

1854.53 --> 1864.37
so I'm not saying that's a good thing or

1860.68 --> 1867.64
anything would just don't worry so much

1864.37 --> 1869.53
about it don't look at all these stats

1867.64 --> 1872.17
and all the hockey sticks and all the

1869.53 --> 1875.08
hypes and all the the horror are death

1872.17 --> 1877.3300000000002
scenarios that they like to sneak in

1875.08 --> 1881.82
there to hype it up even further

1877.33 --> 1886.75
right and just look at the general data

1881.82 --> 1891.28
the real data like people figured out

1886.75 --> 1895.45
about the virus and not the hype stories

1891.28 --> 1898.1499999999999
about that just this what it actually is

1895.45 --> 1900.04
the data and then yeah everything I've

1898.15 --> 1901.0900000000001
said so far that it's pretty much that

1900.04 --> 1902.59
it's like yeah it's less dangerous

1901.09 --> 1903.1299999999999
there's more effects just first the

1902.59 --> 1907.6
airborne

1903.13 --> 1912.1000000000001
okay but the lethal the lethality is

1907.6 --> 1916.7199999999998
lower as simple as that but then there

1912.1 --> 1921.31
may be other influences of course still

1916.72 --> 1924.34
correlation based concept to me but the

1921.31 --> 1926.74
5g influence that it's known that it can

1924.34 --> 1929.3799999999999
deprive oxygen in certain frequencies

1926.74 --> 1931.72
and all that okay so I want to know is

1929.38 --> 1934.5400000000002
there a correlation between 5g Cities

1931.72 --> 1936.07
and where the corona outbreak is the

1934.54 --> 1940.26
worst supposed to where there's these

1936.07 --> 1943.1499999999999
death tolls and what spreads quicker

1940.26 --> 1947.92
because I'm not saying that 5g literally

1943.15 --> 1949.9
causes outer nothing a disease that's

1947.92 --> 1953.65
not what I'm saying that that's that was

1949.9 --> 1957.0400000000002
never the claim really although yeah

1953.65 --> 1961.48
it's interesting to explore the concept

1957.04 --> 1963.8799999999999
but what I am starting to suspect more

1961.48 --> 1967.84
and more is that 5g activity and even

1963.88 --> 1972.5400000000002
like Wi-Fi close to you a lot of that

1967.84 --> 1976.03
zapping literally aggravates the

1972.54 --> 1979.11
symptoms when you have the flu or the

1976.03 --> 1982.12
corona and I think that may be an

1979.11 --> 1984.6689999999999
important factor as to what is

1982.12 --> 1990.7299999999998
transpiring in the world but it's it's

1984.669 --> 1993.509
it's just a concept so far but that's

1990.73 --> 1995.8890000000001
why I want to see these comparative Maps

1993.509 --> 1999.519
dispossess corona outbreaks across the

1995.889 --> 2002.129
world and why are the 5g has officially

1999.519 --> 2003.179
been installed in cities I want to see

2002.129 --> 2006.889
it now when I compare it

2003.179 --> 2006.8890000000001
then we'll look further

2022.57 --> 2025.86
you're talking about

2029.74 --> 2037.3
I am on the wrong track oh really how do

2032.89 --> 2039.5200000000002
you know the wrong track so I can't

2037.3 --> 2042.1299999999999
basically just say hey is there a

2039.52 --> 2043.48
correlation let's compare it it's on the

2042.13 --> 2047.95
wrong track how do you know did you

2043.48 --> 2050.5
compare it you know wrong track

2047.95 --> 2052.06
what does that mean that that's not

2050.5 --> 2056.649
really a rebuttal it's just saying it

2052.06 --> 2061.36
now can you please prove it to me that

2056.649 --> 2063.5499999999997
I'm wrong but this can you show me data

2061.36 --> 2066.06
that definitely conflicts with the

2063.55 --> 2066.0600000000004
concept

2084.37 --> 2091.89
you like my take on it all yesterday I

2088.11 --> 2095.1600000000003
was like [ __ ] what I don't remember

2091.89 --> 2095.16
about what

2103.53 --> 2111.0400000000004
arresting the Cabal okay oh wait so this

2109.03 --> 2116.6200000000003
is about the whole queue thing again

2111.04 --> 2122.38
yeah I kind of moved on yeah arresting

2116.62 --> 2125.08
the Cabal I don't know man that's this

2122.38 --> 2128.4700000000003
thing going on you know concerning that

2125.08 --> 2129.7599999999998
concerning the deep state and you know

2128.47 --> 2135.1
you know what I mean

2129.76 --> 2138.4900000000002
so the Cabal the deep state is

2135.1 --> 2139.6
definitely under the loop so whatever

2138.49 --> 2141.8799999999997
they're gonna do they're kind of

2139.6 --> 2144.33
definitely kind of convinced the people

2141.88 --> 2148.3900000000003
like yeah we are taking care of it

2144.33 --> 2152.3199999999997
because yet they are kind of uncovered

2148.39 --> 2155.47
in their act you know that's that's

2152.32 --> 2158.29
their but indeed it doesn't necessarily

2155.47 --> 2160.39
mean that they are gonna be taken down

2158.29 --> 2163.06
literally like completely taken out of

2160.39 --> 2165.1299999999997
the game because they may have functions

2163.06 --> 2168.19
in the bigger picture that we don't know

2165.13 --> 2170.6800000000003
about so it would be a scenario like

2168.19 --> 2173.89
yeah despite everything we cannot afford

2170.68 --> 2175.8999999999996
to lose them at this point they still

2173.89 --> 2177.49
have roles to fulfill that kind of thing

2175.9 --> 2182.34
you know it sounds very conspiratorial

2177.49 --> 2186.52
but yeah that could be what's going on

2182.34 --> 2190.4500000000003
but who knows maybe this is like the the

2186.52 --> 2196.5
final trip and after this it they will

2190.45 --> 2196.5
be I don't know I don't know but

2198.779 --> 2203.909
maybe some maybe a couple again will be

2202.529 --> 2207.439
dated maybe it's like that it's like

2203.909 --> 2211.789
yeah we got three more core people and

2207.439 --> 2217.3489999999997
yeah make a big show trial out of it

2211.789 --> 2219.119
very long very honest at least day what

2217.349 --> 2221.009
we give an opportunity I like that so

2219.119 --> 2222.809
make it as long as but that kind of

2221.009 --> 2225.239
thing you know it's like everything is

2222.809 --> 2233.009
basically to just postpone as much

2225.239 --> 2236.489
because I do think that they have like a

2233.009 --> 2242.549
role to fulfill or something in the

2236.489 --> 2248.2490000000003
bigger plan and and nobody's telling it

2242.549 --> 2251.369
I don't know man maybe maybe I'm just it

2248.249 --> 2256.4089999999997
may be my conspiratorial missus and

2251.369 --> 2258.4790000000003
career on the out of control but anyway

2256.409 --> 2261.779
that's that's how I see it it could be

2258.479 --> 2264.359
you know some of them could be taken

2261.779 --> 2267.359
down but I don't think the whole the

2264.359 --> 2269.5989999999997
whole calls in the opposition all those

2267.359 --> 2272.369
people will literally be completely

2269.599 --> 2276.7690000000002
taken down almost revolution style I

2272.369 --> 2279.239
don't think that they can do that or we

2276.769 --> 2281.939
technically might be able to do it but I

2279.239 --> 2284.309
don't think they can afford that they

2281.939 --> 2286.2889999999998
can I think they couldn't afford the

2284.309 --> 2291.3590000000004
consequences of all that of what would

2286.289 --> 2293.13
proceed after that like that but yeah

2291.359 --> 2296.8489999999997
there's definitely a chance that certain

2293.13 --> 2299.5190000000002
core people will be subtly put on the

2296.849 --> 2306.1400000000003
spotlight and held accountable for their

2299.519 --> 2308.8489999999997
crimes as everywhere who knows we'll see

2306.14 --> 2312.749
in the meantime it's kind of important

2308.849 --> 2315.449
that you just try not to get too carried

2312.749 --> 2318.2389999999996
away with all the hype concerning

2315.449 --> 2320.4
everything because it's all just being

2318.239 --> 2322.909
hyped up everything isn't being hyped up

2320.4 --> 2325.679
one way or the other

2322.909 --> 2327.449
everybody's making noise look at me look

2325.679 --> 2329.839
at me yo it's all special it's gonna

2327.449 --> 2329.839
happen

2337.33 --> 2340.59
who is this

2352.58 --> 2356.14
he's doing here for a niche

2358.81 --> 2366.09
I banned you for a good reason last time

2361.84 --> 2366.09
then don't come back with soccer cards

2382.35 --> 2387.2599999999998
I told my Hank says the virus yeah it's

2385.14 --> 2387.2599999999998
hilarious

2394.5 --> 2401.609
okay four in each if I didn't then why

2398.13 --> 2404.0
are you coming with this this other

2401.609 --> 2404.0
account

2412.45 --> 2418.3289999999997
Oh Jose that's a good one isn't it yeah

2415.69 --> 2421.15
how do I do it how do I have to show and

2418.329 --> 2424.3
talk about things every single day well

2421.15 --> 2426.07
there's a certain trick to it the trick

2424.3 --> 2428.98
isn't simple and requires a lot of

2426.07 --> 2434.29
dedication mainly you got to have a

2428.98 --> 2436.119
point you can't be fluid you can't be go

2434.29 --> 2438.339
along to get along just to get the

2436.119 --> 2440.17
little extra cash or something that

2438.339 --> 2442.839
doesn't work you got to have a point and

2440.17 --> 2449.109
you got to be as consistent as possible

2442.839 --> 2454.24
and pay attention pay a lot of attention

2449.109 --> 2456.369
don't get drug in the stupid spiraling

2454.24 --> 2459.339
thoughts of people don't get carried

2456.369 --> 2461.38
away by them getting carried away that's

2459.339 --> 2461.89
a important part of the trick and if you

2461.38 --> 2464.1400000000003
do that

2461.89 --> 2468.46
then there's always stuff to talk about

2464.14 --> 2470.6189999999997
as people around you are having trouble

2468.46 --> 2475.93
not spiraling out of control because

2470.619 --> 2476.53
that's what's happening a lot so there

2475.93 --> 2479.5299999999997
you go

2476.53 --> 2482.05
but it's tough one I don't I don't know

2479.53 --> 2484.75
if you can do it because you are much

2482.05 --> 2488.6800000000003
more of a I don't know a class

2484.75 --> 2491.05
management like I am a teacher I sit

2488.68 --> 2493.66
here and I demand you pay attention or

2491.05 --> 2499.48
there's consequences I'm like that

2493.66 --> 2503.17
you're more like a well you're more like

2499.48 --> 2505.27
a kindergarten teacher sorry and you

2503.17 --> 2507.31
just have a nice class and you just ever

2505.27 --> 2510.43
let everybody do their thing and make

2507.31 --> 2512.29
sure that it doesn't get to eat it like

2510.43 --> 2515.56
a kindergarten teacher it so that is

2512.29 --> 2522.19
more your thing you're not that bad at

2515.56 --> 2525.22
it but yeah that's doesn't like it

2522.19 --> 2528.099
doesn't really work that if you just

2525.22 --> 2531.5099999999998
talk an hour a day with a crowd like

2528.099 --> 2531.51
that that doesn't work

2533.77 --> 2538.55
right Jose well that's fine that's you

2536.81 --> 2542.09
know I made this choice I made the

2538.55 --> 2544.13
choice to do this based on my I don't

2542.09 --> 2547.73
know unbearable

2544.13 --> 2549.92
capacity to never shut the hell up so I

2547.73 --> 2552.05
thought okay well if I can't shut the

2549.92 --> 2555.23
hell up and it annoys people then I

2552.05 --> 2558.05
might just as well try to harness it it

2555.23 --> 2559.76
kind of turned it into a profession yeah

2558.05 --> 2566.03
my profession is never shutting the hell

2559.76 --> 2568.61
up about that it kind of works as long

2566.03 --> 2572.42
as I keep working on it and no don't

2568.61 --> 2574.01
just no I got to be principled they got

2572.42 --> 2575.03
to take it serious I got to be careful I

2574.01 --> 2576.6200000000003
got a progress

2575.03 --> 2579.8
I got to keep building I got to keep

2576.62 --> 2584.93
building my understanding my move my

2579.8 --> 2588.86
word range my attitude all that and then

2584.93 --> 2591.14
it works you know it's like with a horse

2588.86 --> 2594.6200000000003
a horse can be super strong if it's just

2591.14 --> 2599.15
wild it's just gonna wreak havoc bashing

2594.62 --> 2601.67
fences all that [ __ ] and run away but if

2599.15 --> 2603.26
you tame it that's really only the first

2601.67 --> 2605.7200000000003
step then then you got to harness it

2603.26 --> 2610.9700000000003
then you gotta put the saddle on put the

2605.72 --> 2612.47
brittle zone and then and then you can

2610.97 --> 2614.93
really do something with it but it

2612.47 --> 2616.73
requires all that stuff and knowing

2614.93 --> 2619.94
about how it works and all that and and

2616.73 --> 2621.26
then you got something a horse I was

2619.94 --> 2623.7200000000003
talking about a horse yeah I actually

2621.26 --> 2626.3300000000004
know how to horseback ride I have I've

2623.72 --> 2630.83
been pretty good at it but it's a it's

2626.33 --> 2632.45
it has been a while though but I was

2630.83 --> 2636.98
pretty serious about it when I was a kid

2632.45 --> 2639.74
I did it between age of eight I think

2636.98 --> 2647.78
eight or nine maybe ten somewhere there

2639.74 --> 2650.2
and but it was 17 I think yeah there's

2647.78 --> 2653.51
good times for me very challenging it

2650.2 --> 2656.02
really liked horses they can feel your

2653.51 --> 2659.78
fear and I had a lot of fear and very a

2656.02 --> 2662.03
nerve kid and it really like forced me

2659.78 --> 2664.599
like yeah you don't want to walk away

2662.03 --> 2668.15
and look like a complete [ __ ]

2664.599 --> 2669.92
loser you gotta buy freaking through it

2668.15 --> 2672.89
you got to get back on that horse and

2669.92 --> 2675.01
you got to man it up it was a big

2672.89 --> 2678.109
challenge for me and it worked very

2675.01 --> 2681.59
proud of that that I did pull through

2678.109 --> 2686.7799999999997
and like nobody could stop me I would be

2681.59 --> 2688.9100000000003
like nah doesn't matter like what I got

2686.78 --> 2690.2900000000004
hit really hard it hurt really bad I

2688.91 --> 2692.5699999999997
don't give a [ __ ] I'm just gonna get

2690.29 --> 2694.79
back up take your breather for a minute

2692.57 --> 2697.81
get back up like nothing happened

2694.79 --> 2701.359
act and not complain about it absolutely

2697.81 --> 2703.94
nothing that's how you do it that's what

2701.359 --> 2705.74
I learned from horseback riding but I

2703.94 --> 2708.109
had pretty good teachers that were like

2705.74 --> 2712.1899999999996
really old block kind of tough and it

2708.109 --> 2713.54
was good they weren't like oh be careful

2712.19 --> 2715.82
don't do that

2713.54 --> 2718.91
no and we're like no you you got to

2715.82 --> 2721.78
learn your own lessons and don't give up

2718.91 --> 2726.71
don't you dare give up and it was good

2721.78 --> 2731.63
anyway hmm I yeah definitely learned how

2726.71 --> 2735.56
to how it works with horses and saddles

2731.63 --> 2740.3900000000003
and Brittles and all that and eople even

2735.56 --> 2745.31
keeping the stables clean I show votes a

2740.39 --> 2749.75
lot of crap and it was great because

2745.31 --> 2752.69
there were a lot of girls out there they

2749.75 --> 2756.92
really didn't like doing that so for me

2752.69 --> 2759.88
it was like like I'll do that I'll do

2756.92 --> 2765.7400000000002
that for you and they would be like ooh

2759.88 --> 2769.01
okay I love that kid made it a little

2765.74 --> 2771.3489999999997
good didn't do it all the time that I

2769.01 --> 2775.57
didn't sometimes it was just not in good

2771.349 --> 2775.57
mood but yeah it was interesting

2779.29 --> 2785.06
but I was just I was very young so it

2782.29 --> 2786.65
it's no relation I couldn't really talk

2785.06 --> 2791.48
to a girl what I could do that

2786.65 --> 2795.17
you know never got laid yep you know

2791.48 --> 2798.5
they're not during that period I said

2795.17 --> 2802.87
did get a kiss in there a lot a couple

2798.5 --> 2802.87
of cheek kisses that was nice

2817.71 --> 2828.9900000000002
from a horse yeah those two yeah

2822.99 --> 2830.609
definitely the horses are great like

2828.99 --> 2834.54
they have all these different characters

2830.609 --> 2839.52
and they can be so spirit in their

2834.54 --> 2843.69
character I love it and like when a

2839.52 --> 2847.53
horse kind of gets you you know you can

2843.69 --> 2849.839
do entry you become like become like

2847.53 --> 2852.5400000000004
spiritual bodies with them and they'll

2849.839 --> 2855.14
just work with it's amazing

2852.54 --> 2857.99
horses are amazing

2855.14 --> 2863.52
[Music]

2857.99 --> 2868.29
now tbh I don't think that at all I just

2863.52 --> 2877.53
think the media is not presenting the

2868.29 --> 2880.5299999999997
situation as really is I'm not saying

2877.53 --> 2883.5
that the coronavirus does not exist I'm

2880.53 --> 2888.6600000000003
just saying that the coronavirus may not

2883.5 --> 2891.619
be what is taught to people that it is

2888.66 --> 2891.6189999999997
that is all

2896.88 --> 2901.1890000000003
[Music]

2903.41 --> 2918.74
[Music]

2912.589 --> 2922.92
what is it that okay Wow from the

2918.74 --> 2926.8489999999997
original German new medicine alternative

2922.92 --> 2929.88
medicine people go group and Rudolf

2926.849 --> 2931.98
Steiner a legacy I call it the riddle

2929.88 --> 2936.0
Steiner legacy was involved in that as

2931.98 --> 2939.119
well medical revolution right they

2936.0 --> 2941.73
figured out and it's kind of being now

2939.119 --> 2945.589
back engineered even by just general

2941.73 --> 2951.06
alternative medical people that well

2945.589 --> 2954.359
viruses may not be hostile entities like

2951.06 --> 2955.859
for example hostile bacteria are because

2954.359 --> 2958.29
can definitely be established that

2955.859 --> 2960.9
certain types of bacteria are like

2958.29 --> 2965.43
invasion forces they damage you the

2960.9 --> 2970.349
poison you the yeah they parasite but

2965.43 --> 2974.79
viruses however seem to be not that at

2970.349 --> 2980.369
all but rather a secondary mechanism

2974.79 --> 2984.15
like a body clean up response team like

2980.369 --> 2987.3
a cellular working crew that helps clean

2984.15 --> 2990.839
up the mess and very definitely a

2987.3 --> 2994.8590000000004
difficult circumstances due to that

2990.839 --> 2997.589
condition of the body so it's like a I

2994.859 --> 2999.24
call it a metabolic overhaul system

2997.589 --> 3001.67
that's what I originally started calling

2999.24 --> 3004.1299999999997
it metabolic overhaul system it's and it

3001.67 --> 3006.4700000000003
is psychosomatically trigger ball also

3004.13 --> 3009.589
that's another aspect of it of the

3006.47 --> 3011.72
flu-like if you believe it if you're

3009.589 --> 3013.88
scared of it even just a common cold

3011.72 --> 3018.3489999999997
right and you see people dis nipples and

3013.88 --> 3020.3
or like I think the situation like this

3018.349 --> 3022.599
you're really nervous about this [ __ ]

3020.3 --> 3024.98
you're really germaphobic as it were and

3022.599 --> 3027.829
you're just going around you give

3024.98 --> 3029.48
somebody hands his head is wet and then

3027.829 --> 3030.2000000000003
you see they have a giant drippy nose in

3029.48 --> 3032.9900000000002
the works

3030.2 --> 3035.2999999999997
yeah that's that is typically it freaks

3032.99 --> 3038.0299999999997
you out if you're really germaphobe that

3035.3 --> 3043.28
is a shock trigger that could typically

3038.03 --> 3049.6600000000003
then cause you to get that cold even

3043.28 --> 3052.73
though yeah it's not really about the

3049.66 --> 3056.71
stuff getting on you it is about a

3052.73 --> 3059.87
psychosomatic if that's what I think now

3056.71 --> 3063.77
the strength of that effect may differ

3059.87 --> 3066.83
from person to person depending on how

3063.77 --> 3069.95
much spirit they have how deep the shock

3066.83 --> 3072.83
is how much belief they have in general

3069.95 --> 3078.31
how much energy goes into that that they

3072.83 --> 3082.88
can trigger it and yeah sometimes people

3078.31 --> 3086.0
they just get it because the body just

3082.88 --> 3088.57
needs it it's like okay the conditions

3086.0 --> 3093.26
are right in the weather and all that

3088.57 --> 3096.3500000000004
these this this level of remnant toxins

3093.26 --> 3098.78
are now roughly in every cell in the

3096.35 --> 3101.71
body keeping up from all the year and

3098.78 --> 3105.02
all that it's time to get rid of that

3101.71 --> 3110.03
and since there's no other way let's

3105.02 --> 3113.0
start the the cleanup crew oh you get

3110.03 --> 3117.38
sick fever of and then it's like oh I'm

3113.0 --> 3119.66
infected well it may simply be just the

3117.38 --> 3122.2400000000002
cleanup crew getting activated because

3119.66 --> 3125.48
your body needs it and hey how many

3122.24 --> 3127.8799999999997
people do you know that get sick or get

3125.48 --> 3129.59
the flu but especially just cold you

3127.88 --> 3132.26
know and that afterward when it goes

3129.59 --> 3134.8700000000003
away especially if they have like fever

3132.26 --> 3135.4700000000003
situations don't they always feel a lot

3134.87 --> 3139.16
better

3135.47 --> 3144.68
like really more relief more clear that

3139.16 --> 3149.0
kind of yeah well guess why that is see

3144.68 --> 3153.47
another little piece puzzle

3149.0 --> 3154.099
so yeah my framework conception what

3153.47 --> 3156.6189999999997
this is

3154.099 --> 3162.02
there's something very viable about it

3156.619 --> 3170.65
it's a it's a viable model guys it's not

3162.02 --> 3174.77
just kooky well I really oppositional

3170.65 --> 3177.56
defiance disorder groan idea like no it

3174.77 --> 3180.2599999999998
can be like this so this is still no no

3177.56 --> 3190.21
no no no this has been carefully thought

3180.26 --> 3190.21
about so

3194.75 --> 3204.32
so tbh I've already given my my my fuse

3199.52 --> 3206.0
and my responses to it elaborately that

3204.32 --> 3209.57
there is an early bird show that

3206.0 --> 3213.53
literally has the title corona virus

3209.57 --> 3217.099
spell and I explain a lot of what I'm

3213.53 --> 3227.27
telling you right now and the more

3217.099 --> 3229.78
ruffcut way it is all in there why why

3227.27 --> 3235.97
should I have an opinion about that

3229.78 --> 3237.8590000000004
good thing but what why are you asking

3235.97 --> 3242.6899999999996
me again if it doesn't exist didn't I

3237.859 --> 3245.06
just give you a very elaborate answer

3242.69 --> 3248.06
this is getting annoying TV you're

3245.06 --> 3253.79
you're starting to solicit a banning

3248.06 --> 3258.79
here so please give some feedback that

3253.79 --> 3258.79
you actually got what I was saying

3276.1 --> 3288.36
so anything else I'm gonna round out the

3281.32 --> 3288.36
show soon anyway just two more minutes

3294.51 --> 3301.5
have I tested the model scientific

3297.27 --> 3304.34
method oh dear huh huh TV well I am NOT

3301.5 --> 3307.44
I don't have a laboratory I don't have

3304.34 --> 3314.67
I'm not like in an active medical

3307.44 --> 3318.5
profession so I I couldn't do that but

3314.67 --> 3323.19
there have been people that have and

3318.5 --> 3325.44
yeah they have a scientific trial and

3323.19 --> 3333.14
error based model with that and they

3325.44 --> 3337.92
fade it's just they tested this stuff

3333.14 --> 3341.58
there's vast studies like with thousands

3337.92 --> 3345.9900000000002
of people they've all been part of

3341.58 --> 3349.7999999999997
figuring out this model so yes it is

3345.99 --> 3357.0299999999997
definitely scientific method based very

3349.8 --> 3359.2200000000003
much so cause and effect right natural

3357.03 --> 3363.0
phenomena all these things yes has all

3359.22 --> 3367.29
been used in figuring out this medical

3363.0 --> 3369.51
model this medical approach definitely

3367.29 --> 3372.359
because it has been tested the proof was

3369.51 --> 3376.5600000000004
there the person that originally tried

3372.359 --> 3379.38
to put this out they were like arrested

3376.56 --> 3382.77
and they were sued by the Medical Board

3379.38 --> 3388.38
and all that like when was it way back

3382.77 --> 3390.09
and yeah they try to like just drop all

3388.38 --> 3392.46
the books on them all of it like

3390.09 --> 3396.06
anything they could almost like politics

3392.46 --> 3398.96
but but real and not given attention

3396.06 --> 3402.7999999999997
really it was like a real hard crackdown

3398.96 --> 3407.609
judicially but they couldn't do it they

3402.8 --> 3411.9
couldn't prove he was wrong he couldn't

3407.609 --> 3416.5099999999998
because he was right right and they won

3411.9 --> 3416.51
and then it was never mentioned again

3417.62 --> 3421.77
and now I should look up the specific

3419.91 --> 3424.19
guys I think other people have already

3421.77 --> 3427.44
kind of presented it but that's the

3424.19 --> 3432.9900000000002
people that are at the foundation of

3427.44 --> 3442.41
this alternative medical approach the

3432.99 --> 3444.1099999999997
German new medicine and all that yeah

3442.41 --> 3451.5899999999997
you're getting a timeout for that don't

3444.11 --> 3453.81
don't do that could you be wrong and the

3451.59 --> 3456.48
actual scientists know what they are

3453.81 --> 3459.93
talking about uh-huh

3456.48 --> 3463.02
could it be wrong oh god this is such

3459.93 --> 3464.66
baller crap dude tbh this is really

3463.02 --> 3469.77
embarrassing

3464.66 --> 3474.33
could I be wrong well could could I be

3469.77 --> 3477.87
wrong that that guy that did all the

3474.33 --> 3478.3199999999997
research and was sued massively won the

3477.87 --> 3482.37
case

3478.32 --> 3485.9700000000003
could I be wrong about that could I what

3482.37 --> 3490.35
kind of a question is that why would I

3485.97 --> 3494.1899999999996
even bring it up it is so bizarre that's

3490.35 --> 3496.7999999999997
why I bring it up because it's kind of

3494.19 --> 3500.2200000000003
telling when that happens somebody gets

3496.8 --> 3504.51
sued over malpractice and fraud medical

3500.22 --> 3507.66
fraud and then nothing they did nothing

3504.51 --> 3509.6400000000003
wrong they could not disprove his

3507.66 --> 3512.3399999999997
concept everything he did was all

3509.64 --> 3517.04
correct was all medically correct it was

3512.34 --> 3521.67
all nothing nothing he could do

3517.04 --> 3524.16
brilliant yeah links to this stuff yeah

3521.67 --> 3526.17
I kind of do owe people that I'm gonna

3524.16 --> 3533.0099999999998
probably ask my dad I'm pretty sure he

3526.17 --> 3535.02
does know the links to that but it's

3533.01 --> 3538.8300000000004
something that really happened and it's

3535.02 --> 3540.48
awesome and it's Salieri's how long ago

3538.83 --> 3543.2999999999997
this was I think it was like in the 60s

3540.48 --> 3545.25
or something or 70s a not a hundred

3543.3 --> 3547.3100000000004
percent sure what it was quite a while

3545.25 --> 3547.31
ago

3548.53 --> 3554.2400000000002
could be way off by decades by the way

3551.48 --> 3558.32
I'm not sure definitely sure it was

3554.24 --> 3560.74
before before the 90s absolutely sure

3558.32 --> 3560.7400000000002
about that

3562.03 --> 3568.52
yes TV I don't have it because I my

3565.369 --> 3572.6600000000003
computer is not a library for every

3568.52 --> 3576.68
single document ever and I've been kind

3572.66 --> 3579.3199999999997
of hesitant to personally become more

3576.68 --> 3581.5099999999998
expert at it because I find this

3579.32 --> 3585.23
knowledge very tough it took me a long

3581.51 --> 3587.0
time before I could even accept that it

3585.23 --> 3599.839
would be real because it kind of freaked

3587.0 --> 3606.56
me out how different it was yeah well

3599.839 --> 3609.71
