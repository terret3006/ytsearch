0.949 --> 9.24
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

5.19 --> 12.84
early-bird episode 22 I'm your host

9.24 --> 15.36
Arwen and starting out the show no

12.84 --> 21.3
guests sorry for being a little bit late

15.36 --> 22.74
an errant run again yeah terrible

21.3 --> 25.380000000000003
weather and it was just getting some

22.74 --> 28.769
things and I realized oh damn I have no

25.38 --> 32.278999999999996
coffee so I didn't want to go through

28.769 --> 33.68
that weather again so I just went ahead

32.279 --> 36.870000000000005
and did it anyway

33.68 --> 41.399
yeah because that arrived like 50

36.87 --> 44.76
minutes before - and there's yeah more

41.399 --> 48.27
than 50 minutes preparation so sorry for

44.76 --> 56.339999999999996
being a little late but I'm here a flat

48.27 --> 62.27
earther t-bird 22 it's gone fast see

56.34 --> 69.51
using chat tank flat earth questionnaire

62.27 --> 78.869
Daniel field I'll be Hilton pop Alicia

69.51 --> 79.83000000000001
champagne Nicholas Daniel David Reed

78.869 --> 85.65
hello

79.83 --> 90.92999999999999
welcome everyone pretty much a blank

85.65 --> 94.56
mind today some personal stuff that's

90.93 --> 97.759
not very interesting let's see what are

94.56 --> 97.759
you talking about in here

106.14 --> 113.219
Leisha champagne says something

108.81 --> 117.539
interesting how the moon affects the

113.219 --> 125.579
water that could have an influence on

117.539 --> 131.31
the germination of seeds yeah sure this

125.579 --> 137.7
a lot of nature cycles are tied in -

131.31 --> 141.63
yeah - celestial elements - light cycles

137.7 --> 144.63
and yeah light influences water so I

141.63 --> 150.239
guess that most of these influences will

144.63 --> 152.28
go through water the water will cause

150.239 --> 155.13
the change will be the seed of change

152.28 --> 158.25
basically and the celestial bodies will

155.13 --> 165.14
influence that water the trigger he

158.25 --> 165.14
changes yeah sure regard it like that I

169.85 --> 176.78
guess it's a new thing seed germination

172.769 --> 176.78
and the full moon sure

183.98 --> 186.98
okay

194.34 --> 211.54
right your discussions here you guys are

205.99 --> 215.07000000000002
having in chats so what's what's going

211.54 --> 215.07
on what's going on guys

216.42 --> 223.35999999999999
Flat Earth debates are going pretty

218.5 --> 227.7
smooth steady forward really feels like

223.36 --> 233.35000000000002
I guess a sailing journey on the boat

227.7 --> 235.95999999999998
and we keep on making ground and ballers

233.35 --> 238.32
try to catch up but they just keep them

235.96 --> 241.68
stuck because they don't know how to

238.32 --> 244.98
properly navigate because it's a bottle

241.68 --> 244.98000000000002
doesn't work

252.23 --> 263.419
yeah it's almost how do you say if you

260.25 --> 269.04
keep on winning in discussions and

263.419 --> 271.919
there's no direct threat that will come

269.04 --> 276.03000000000003
from these people that I can detect any

271.919 --> 277.56
new threat or a next layer no it just it

276.03 --> 280.53
almost becomes a little bit boring

277.56 --> 282.389
because yeah we got them and they'll

280.53 --> 286.32
never get up but we still got it

282.389 --> 288.6
so we're sister gonna leave are they

286.32 --> 293.96999999999997
gonna stop some point I don't think so

288.6 --> 297.45000000000005
or maybe they will maybe they will run

293.97 --> 300.3
out of fuel eventually though they'll

297.45 --> 303.69
just lose it or they just walk away and

300.3 --> 306.51
pretend like nothing happened I don't

303.69 --> 308.21999999999997
know what's gonna happen but we're

306.51 --> 316.8
winning and it just keeps on going

308.22 --> 321.36
ah all right I got some ballers here in

316.8 --> 323.94
chap all right so any evidence of Flat

321.36 --> 327.18
Earth that's not completely made up well

323.94 --> 332.37
yeah how about we see things cuz they're

327.18 --> 335.76
there and on the ball you're not

332.37 --> 339.84000000000003
supposed to see things that far from

335.76 --> 341.669
such a low observer height maybe you

339.84 --> 344.46
know it's not really made up it's just

341.669 --> 348.0
look it's there as a straight line of

344.46 --> 351.21
sight you can draw a certain level of

348.0 --> 355.47
geometrical conclusions from that you

351.21 --> 361.88899999999995
know don't think that's made up it's

355.47 --> 366.11
very intuitive actually all you got to

361.889 --> 366.11
do is allow it to sink you

374.41 --> 377.46000000000004
now come on

392.9 --> 401.71999999999997
all right nice red herring there Howard

395.54 --> 408.16
Mason yeah yeah the thing is about a

401.72 --> 410.66
reflection it's a reflection so

408.16 --> 412.52000000000004
something is reflected then it's

410.66 --> 414.199
reflecting of something what you're

412.52 --> 419.06
looking at at the horizon is not a

414.199 --> 423.05
reflection of you it's a bit of

419.06 --> 425.75
reflection of the local region there in

423.05 --> 427.82
the Mirage in zone effect beyond the

425.75 --> 433.82
optical slant point yeah that happens

427.82 --> 438.62
but still that is there it is locally

433.82 --> 441.74
there even though parts may be obscured

438.62 --> 444.02
and if you just look at the distance

441.74 --> 446.93
versus what is obscured of these things

444.02 --> 449.15
and what can still be seen you'll find

446.93 --> 451.039
there's a linear relation and you can

449.15 --> 455.33
see much further than a standard

451.039 --> 459.56
curvature would allow just mirages

455.33 --> 463.789
doesn't really matter because it's not

459.56 --> 467.03000000000003
all uniformly looming up all of it which

463.789 --> 470.15
is the requirement for for that approach

467.03 --> 473.71999999999997
it's not doing that nobody's brought

470.15 --> 475.729
forth any reasonable model to even

473.72 --> 479.28900000000004
demonstrate how that could work

475.729 --> 481.099
in a way that it'll actually look real

479.289 --> 484.34
so good luck with that

481.099 --> 487.25
maybe rhombus is working on it it's 98%

484.34 --> 493.38899999999995
there bla bla bla

487.25 --> 496.01
so good luck see it's because it's there

493.389 --> 499.52
parts may be obstructed but the fact

496.01 --> 503.599
that we still see it means there's a

499.52 --> 505.849
straight line aside to it and you can

503.599 --> 509.99
draw certain geometrical conclusions

505.849 --> 515.77
from that straight line aside it's very

509.99 --> 515.77
simple it's not even deduction it's just

516.289 --> 523.42
you see it because it's there it's that

518.389 --> 526.04
simple and it's not all uniformly

523.42 --> 531.5
looming out of place there's not an

526.04 --> 533.93
image displaced beyond where it not

531.5 --> 536.06
where it's not really at that doesn't

533.93 --> 538.04
happen or that happens in there very

536.06 --> 542.209
rare circumstance is not in the general

538.04 --> 545.8389999999999
view at all so any reflection any

542.209 --> 547.9399999999999
looming effect will be a mirroring

545.839 --> 551.269
effect of something else that's right

547.94 --> 553.1600000000001
there or that direct displacement but

551.269 --> 556.3100000000001
that thing is gonna still be there the

553.16 --> 560.8389999999999
or origin is not going to be hidden from

556.31 --> 562.79
sight of the reflection no the

560.839 --> 567.1600000000001
reflection is the cover from what is

562.79 --> 567.16
hidden inside that's how it works

573.45 --> 583.95
you can't have a reflection of something

576.75 --> 583.95
in the distance and not see the original

584.58 --> 591.4200000000001
and that's the extremely rare

587.77 --> 591.42
circumstances again

601.83 --> 613.5500000000001
so yeah hello Karen be in chat be Mars

609.86 --> 613.5500000000001
age am

618.91 --> 623.23
letters questioner duty

631.48 --> 637.15
and don't get too cocky Glover's if you

634.8 --> 644.0799999999999
you're not doing that but if you are

637.15 --> 645.9399999999999
then I will eventually start wrenching

644.08 --> 649.45
and kicking people again so don't get

645.94 --> 654.19
cocky no just because I loosen up the

649.45 --> 661.4200000000001
rules a little anyway yeah everyone

654.19 --> 664.45
that's behaving fairly so far see look

661.42 --> 666.04
if anybody eat here like to join me here

664.45 --> 670.2900000000001
on the panel and discuss something

666.04 --> 674.98
anything I don't have a lot of things to

670.29 --> 676.6899999999999
come template really mostly the same and

674.98 --> 678.36
that's stupid if you just start

676.69 --> 680.95
repeating the same thing over again

678.36 --> 685.86
maybe some my new details here and there

680.95 --> 685.86
right after so no nothing new

706.32 --> 710.94
yeah

708.25 --> 710.94
right

735.699 --> 742.9799999999999
mmm good question there up oliver varney

739.739 --> 746.85
anybody else has question that can also

742.98 --> 750.369
talk about stuff so if you got questions

746.85 --> 752.3190000000001
anyway Oliver Barney says what's the

750.369 --> 753.97
rationale for people like Alan showing

752.319 --> 756.669
up every day wasting three hours of

753.97 --> 760.359
their life when they think Flat Earth is

756.669 --> 763.209
a crazy idea for mental people well I'm

760.359 --> 765.8190000000001
pretty sure that it is route them routed

763.209 --> 774.0089999999999
for many of these people probably Pete

765.819 --> 776.649
Mars also in escapism because they have

774.009 --> 779.439
a need for social interactions they

776.649 --> 783.879
don't know really how to engage with the

779.439 --> 787.569
general public - well I guess or they're

783.879 --> 789.549
born by them and so they just need

787.569 --> 792.79
people to talk to but yeah they're not

789.549 --> 797.169
very good at making real serious friends

792.79 --> 802.149
long term subtle friendships with real

797.169 --> 805.629
people so they just do this instead so

802.149 --> 810.489
they have need obviously for more so

805.629 --> 813.629
yeah in social interactions and hearings

810.489 --> 817.1790000000001
people's thoughts that kind of thing and

813.629 --> 819.309
yeah their religious opinion their

817.179 --> 820.98
religious angle to the subject is

819.309 --> 823.8689999999999
another matter entirely

820.98 --> 826.499
because yeah they will think it's stupid

823.869 --> 829.48
but at the same time they'll love it

826.499 --> 831.369
because it's fulfills the needs so they

829.48 --> 833.769
might keep calling it stupid but of

831.369 --> 837.249
course they'll be returning and they'll

833.769 --> 846.149
act like it's all normal it is kind of

837.249 --> 848.8290000000001
like a bit of a Stockholm Syndrome thing

846.149 --> 854.109
they hate it but they love it and

848.829 --> 859.5089999999999
there's just not surrendering to slavery

854.109 --> 862.9290000000001
I guess but they are just rolling over

859.509 --> 866.429
and degrading themselves allowed

862.929 --> 868.9399999999999
allowing people to play with them to

866.429 --> 872.3299999999999
degrade them

868.94 --> 878.1800000000001
using their religious views basically to

872.33 --> 882.1700000000001
retain some sort of pride so they can be

878.18 --> 884.4799999999999
like martyrs to themselves from that

882.17 --> 888.17
religious perspective that keeps them

884.48 --> 889.76
afloat the same time yeah the actual

888.17 --> 891.29
things that are happening in all the

889.76 --> 896.5
social interactions almost like a

891.29 --> 899.48
playground at school they want this it

896.5 --> 903.2
fulfills them it gives them social

899.48 --> 907.1
interactions and allows them to laugh

903.2 --> 916.6400000000001
out loud or to be really mean or be

907.1 --> 920.69
really you say uptight or persecuting

916.64 --> 923.75
accusing all these social behaviors that

920.69 --> 925.97
are part of the human behavior spectrum

923.75 --> 927.74
they have the need to express these and

925.97 --> 930.89
he on this platform you can do all

927.74 --> 933.14
everything and there are some not a lot

930.89 --> 935.18
of boundaries and but at the same time

933.14 --> 939.26
there's the safety of the Internet so if

935.18 --> 941.8399999999999
things really go nutty you can if you

939.26 --> 944.84
are consciously present you can choose

941.84 --> 947.0600000000001
to just disengage and just step back

944.84 --> 949.61
it's not like it's your own home and you

947.06 --> 952.88
can't escape so yeah it is a very

949.61 --> 955.16
convenient platform that fulfills a lot

952.88 --> 960.14
of needs even though the subjects

955.16 --> 963.68
themselves may trigger their personal

960.14 --> 968.3199999999999
views and religion but I hope that

963.68 --> 968.3199999999999
explains it very elaborate Arwen fashion

972.55 --> 981.7299999999999
yeah you could call it purely

974.62 --> 988.21
entertainment but yeah if you think

981.73 --> 990.82
that's entertainment because I bet a lot

988.21 --> 993.73
of people find you very entertaining as

990.82 --> 996.07
well a lot of people do

993.73 --> 1000.21
Nathan finds trolls very entertaining

996.07 --> 1005.94
much more than I do I do I still don't

1000.21 --> 1007.5600000000001
appreciate it but I get it and where

1005.94 --> 1009.8000000000001
it's coming from and to just call it

1007.56 --> 1012.03
entertainments as part of the facade

1009.8 --> 1017.63
you're not gonna fool anyone but

1012.03 --> 1017.63
yourself with that really not really

1028.81 --> 1038.6499999999999
oh really psychics warriors in chat and

1034.42 --> 1042.8100000000002
he says he agrees with an AI calling him

1038.65 --> 1045.25
an Asian man so what do you think he is

1042.81 --> 1050.58
have any idea where you come from

1045.25 --> 1054.64
because I just recognized these distinct

1050.58 --> 1056.8
Asian verbal elements in there I thought

1054.64 --> 1060.25
it was Japanese at first but maybe it is

1056.8 --> 1064.3899999999999
like Malaysian or Chinese could be

1060.25 --> 1068.62
anything very much East or southeast of

1064.39 --> 1073.2900000000002
Asia I don't know it just has this is a

1068.62 --> 1076.53
way this extra emphasis on certain

1073.29 --> 1080.05
sounds is just unique to that region

1076.53 --> 1084.99
people don't accidentally intuitively do

1080.05 --> 1084.99
that here in Europe and in America

1086.4 --> 1092.65
Indian right okay people think is in

1090.64 --> 1097.21
look in the eyes also

1092.65 --> 1101.6200000000001
Asia so yeah could be in yes a big

1097.21 --> 1112.75
country the various types of subcultures

1101.62 --> 1114.3899999999999
and accents and everything's okay the

1112.75 --> 1116.56
people think he's from Europe

1114.39 --> 1119.8600000000001
well if he's from Europe then he's

1116.56 --> 1124.78
really faking some real weird accent and

1119.86 --> 1127.27
doing very consistently so so it would

1124.78 --> 1129.94
be a trained accent that he's been

1127.27 --> 1132.85
working on for some time maybe something

1129.94 --> 1136.21
that came up in his youth I don't know

1132.85 --> 1138.1
but I don't think it I think it's really

1136.21 --> 1140.02
him because especially when it's true

1138.1 --> 1142.24
when he's triggered and he is triggered

1140.02 --> 1145.87
I can feel it I can feel that he really

1142.24 --> 1151.24
is trains not acting he still does it

1145.87 --> 1153.76
and that is it's very hard to hide your

1151.24 --> 1155.29
personal accent when you get triggered

1153.76 --> 1157.57
and we see this all the time with

1155.29 --> 1161.62
ballers that are acting in new

1157.57 --> 1162.49
characters it's how I recognize for

1161.62 --> 1166.09
example

1162.49 --> 1168.58
Chris MCM yeah

1166.09 --> 1171.27
just suddenly the Scottish accent just

1168.58 --> 1175.6
flips out because they're on the string

1171.27 --> 1177.85
or they're like like giggling a lot then

1175.6 --> 1180.1
it's all another form of strain it also

1177.85 --> 1186.1899999999998
makes it hard to suppress your own

1180.1 --> 1186.7199999999998
accent and this this guy this was his

1186.19 --> 1191.2
name

1186.72 --> 1193.77
Laurie he'd know he was very consistent

1191.2 --> 1196.1200000000001
in his accent so I don't think he's an

1193.77 --> 1200.17
actor acting another actually as an

1196.12 --> 1202.4499999999998
actor and he isn't like classic troll

1200.17 --> 1207.01
she'll maybe he's a paid troll like a

1202.45 --> 1210.5800000000002
real paid troll because he does really

1207.01 --> 1213.22
fall back to super super simple tactic

1210.58 --> 1215.56
tactics on a higher level though because

1213.22 --> 1218.38
like the really dumb ballers tend to do

1215.56 --> 1221.1399999999999
that too but they are obviously really

1218.38 --> 1223.39
dumb and just make really fool out of

1221.14 --> 1228.49
himself it's kind of funny and silly and

1223.39 --> 1231.16
sad but this guy is he doesn't seem to

1228.49 --> 1235.54
know a lot or doesn't refuse it to talk

1231.16 --> 1240.5800000000002
about details but he is sharper he has

1235.54 --> 1244.93
more insight he has more senses doesn't

1240.58 --> 1247.96
use them in very complex ways though it

1244.93 --> 1250.0900000000001
just seems to be trying to invade people

1247.96 --> 1256.8600000000001
psychologically and really be a nasty

1250.09 --> 1256.86
troll when it comes down to it but I

1257.49 --> 1262.71
don't know just did this

1267.49 --> 1269.55
you

1314.56 --> 1318.7
stupid annoying

1321.77 --> 1324.4
back

1325.669 --> 1329.8690000000001
now write him back yeah sorry me

1328.309 --> 1337.249
internet just cut off and I didn't

1329.869 --> 1342.139
notice annoying I was talking about

1337.249 --> 1349.19
Laurie and just I think he's he is more

1342.139 --> 1352.82
intelligent than he acts and he is

1349.19 --> 1359.029
either a really twisted psychologically

1352.82 --> 1362.899
ill person or he is just like yeah a

1359.029 --> 1364.969
shameless financially driven troll for

1362.899 --> 1371.1789999999999
some reason like why else would you do

1364.969 --> 1373.999
that so that's my opinion on Laurie I'm

1371.179 --> 1376.429
not saying that every baller is like

1373.999 --> 1381.589
that but with him it's very obvious very

1376.429 --> 1384.95
very obvious I'd almost think that he

1381.589 --> 1387.109
was like a colleague or close friend or

1384.95 --> 1390.829
maybe like a large body of rumpus or

1387.109 --> 1394.9589999999998
something cuz he was very alike he was

1390.829 --> 1399.4089999999999
did the approach of the disruptiveness

1394.959 --> 1401.779
felt very much like around us constantly

1399.409 --> 1403.909
just come simply trying to break

1401.779 --> 1409.279
everything apart what's worse than

1403.909 --> 1411.739
groundless rumpus at least has a story

1409.279 --> 1416.139
and a real explanation this guy has

1411.739 --> 1416.1390000000001
absolutely nothing absolutely nothing

1419.559 --> 1429.769
new matrix media and embosser he can go

1426.579 --> 1443.9189999999999
Shane Walter good to see y'all don't

1429.769 --> 1443.919
flower cozy in chat so talking about

1464.379 --> 1474.9289999999999
all right a unsalted 667 this arguing

1469.84 --> 1480.4599999999998
with Pete Mars there look dude insulted

1474.929 --> 1485.289
this guy he he Mars really when you keep

1480.46 --> 1490.57
on pushing he will openly and fully just

1485.289 --> 1492.9089999999999
go yeah into solipsism openly that's his

1490.57 --> 1494.59
bottom line and you can't step past that

1492.909 --> 1498.489
that's why he goes there because he

1494.59 --> 1501.059
doesn't really care it's all the same to

1498.489 --> 1501.059
him anyway

1501.57 --> 1505.889
but he knows so

1525.79 --> 1532.21
hmm Alicia asks so is it possible that

1529.93 --> 1534.8200000000002
the electromagnetic field given off by

1532.21 --> 1541.8400000000001
the full moon will help in the seed

1534.82 --> 1544.99
germination maybe thus the moon give off

1541.84 --> 1547.84
an electromagnetic field does it really

1544.99 --> 1551.35
is there more electromagnetic activity

1547.84 --> 1560.59
when there's a full moon or what is

1551.35 --> 1564.58
there measurably I don't know the Appy

1560.59 --> 1571.24
mark should always go into solipsism you

1564.58 --> 1573.72
always do or you just go into repetitive

1571.24 --> 1577.6
trolling either way that's what you do

1573.72 --> 1580.05
you've been doing since since I first

1577.6 --> 1580.05
met you

1602.01 --> 1605.299
okay amber sir

1625.44 --> 1638.13
right okay I get an on VESA now look

1634.2 --> 1641.6200000000001
what Google Maps did is basically

1638.13 --> 1644.3700000000001
projected into a globe that's it

1641.62 --> 1647.08
that's because under rectangular map

1644.37 --> 1650.35
that same projection the globe

1647.08 --> 1654.1299999999999
projection will be stretched out in the

1650.35 --> 1657.28
north in the far south and that's why

1654.13 --> 1661.0600000000002
Greenland on that on the flat

1657.28 --> 1663.43
rectangular map what is it the most

1661.06 --> 1666.04
widely used projections is so big so

1663.43 --> 1668.1100000000001
yeah in the globe projection it's simply

1666.04 --> 1670.62
not the case that's not going to be how

1668.11 --> 1675.31
big it is it's going to be to scale on

1670.62 --> 1682.3799999999999
the globe projection that's the

1675.31 --> 1685.12
difference it's not the there's no

1682.38 --> 1687.2800000000002
continents in relation to each other

1685.12 --> 1691.81
that have actually changed size and they

1687.28 --> 1697.06
should because I think Africa is

1691.81 --> 1703.54
actually bigger than it is on this map

1697.06 --> 1708.61
even on this globe map for example and

1703.54 --> 1712.6299999999999
yeah what is it the you know what I'll

1708.61 --> 1715.4699999999998
find it on my computer presented again

1712.63 --> 1715.47
I've done it before

1722.179 --> 1725.179
see

1730.93 --> 1745.67
right this map this is the more accurate

1739.52 --> 1749.57
to scale map when presented in a flat

1745.67 --> 1754.88
surface like this never thank you that

1749.57 --> 1757.4199999999998
now it's more to scale the size scale

1754.88 --> 1757.42
visiting

1763.2 --> 1772.4
see here Greenland isn't that big it

1768.18 --> 1774.8400000000001
isn't so it's only on that other

1772.4 --> 1777.8400000000001
projection that we are most used to

1774.84 --> 1781.1999999999998
looking at that it's displayed big

1777.84 --> 1783.4199999999998
because the scale is enlarged when you

1781.2 --> 1787.07
go further to the north and to the south

1783.42 --> 1787.0700000000002
that's the difference

1811.67 --> 1817.5800000000002
right okay investigates it but asks

1815.09 --> 1821.6599999999999
still why do you think they changed

1817.58 --> 1827.06
well they didn't change anything they

1821.66 --> 1828.68
just projected it into a globe so they

1827.06 --> 1832.73
scaled the northern and the southern

1828.68 --> 1834.38
part down to become more to scale in

1832.73 --> 1838.45
accordance to the globe projection

1834.38 --> 1840.8600000000001
because that map is a globe projection

1838.45 --> 1845.06
stretched up in the north in the south

1840.86 --> 1848.35
to become a rectangular square that's

1845.06 --> 1849.6699999999998
how that projection works and if you

1848.35 --> 1852.62
yeah

1849.67 --> 1854.5700000000002
undo that and turn it back into an

1852.62 --> 1858.08
original globe projection then it will

1854.57 --> 1860.8999999999999
look like this but still the continents

1858.08 --> 1865.03
are not to scale and you can prove this

1860.9 --> 1867.68
if you just scroll over the Google map

1865.03 --> 1869.66
over the different continents stay the

1867.68 --> 1873.53
same distance and look at the skill bar

1869.66 --> 1876.5
because it will go become wider and

1873.53 --> 1881.06
smaller depending on the region you're

1876.5 --> 1883.4
hovering over let me try it out so it is

1881.06 --> 1885.62
not the skill it's not actually the

1883.4 --> 1889.7
skill despite it being a globe

1885.62 --> 1894.02
projection and overcoming yeah the very

1889.7 --> 1896.27
obvious scale size increase in the north

1894.02 --> 1900.53
and the south with Greenland and all

1896.27 --> 1908.33
that but still it's not accurate the map

1900.53 --> 1913.1
itself is not accurate it's not a it's

1908.33 --> 1914.81
not a to scale projection still still as

1913.1 --> 1917.53
it as a globe it's still not the scale

1914.81 --> 1917.53
what do we see

1929.74 --> 1933.03
a chocolate same

1935.16 --> 1950.67
hello em Punk T right I wish some of you

1947.31 --> 1952.47
just just get on here and do some

1950.67 --> 1956.25
talking but I guess that you like any

1952.47 --> 1958.77
chat so I get it sometimes like even on

1956.25 --> 1962.82
the flat earth debates you know I'm on

1958.77 --> 1964.52
the panel but stuffer is busy I can't

1962.82 --> 1967.6799999999998
really do anything in between and

1964.52 --> 1971.46
chatting is different it's much more

1967.68 --> 1973.5600000000002
concise format of communication you can

1971.46 --> 1976.5
just put an entire thing out there

1973.56 --> 1980.6699999999998
without being having to find a moment

1976.5 --> 1982.74
specifically to do it and yeah I like it

1980.67 --> 1986.73
in chat too but yeah now it's my hangout

1982.74 --> 1991.14
so I have to keep talking all right

1986.73 --> 1993.22
Ellen B wants to come okay well we got

1991.14 --> 1996.3290000000002
like 50 more minutes why not

1993.22 --> 1996.329
[Music]

2024.76 --> 2028.23
okay that link

2034.37 --> 2037.27
No

2043.98 --> 2046.64
yeah

2048.83 --> 2054.73
okay that was funny so Alan you got the

2052.52 --> 2054.73
link

2075.81 --> 2078.56
yeah

2078.71 --> 2087.599
hello Ellen hello are you doing what

2085.53 --> 2090.599
we're talking about today we're talking

2087.599 --> 2092.94
about trolls on that yeah I guess I

2090.599 --> 2095.849
don't know it's maybe it's the weather

2092.94 --> 2099.4500000000003
or something that's no excuse I don't

2095.849 --> 2102.54
know I I don't really have long-winded

2099.45 --> 2104.2799999999997
stories today what's wrong with the

2102.54 --> 2118.0099999999998
weather the weather is quite bad over

2104.28 --> 2120.3900000000003
here on our wind rain so choco so Alan I

2118.01 --> 2122.1600000000003
came on because Darwin seemed go along

2120.39 --> 2124.65
Lee - sure

2122.16 --> 2127.6189999999997
or was it covered and say what's up and

2124.65 --> 2130.23
you're here Alan so what's up over swing

2127.619 --> 2132.4500000000003
button to have a chat with Owen you

2130.23 --> 2135.9
should be good on Flat Earth debates

2132.45 --> 2141.0299999999997
today because Tony's in Liverpool today

2135.9 --> 2145.109
so you'll be you'll be fine our way is

2141.03 --> 2147.8390000000004
okay he doesn't even complain about me

2145.109 --> 2153.8089999999997
speaking up about aberrations anymore

2147.839 --> 2157.0789999999997
during the high school so that's fine he

2153.809 --> 2166.9500000000003
likes you to have the same idea and fall

2157.079 --> 2169.4100000000003
in line yeah he loves that understand

2166.95 --> 2173.73
when I'm actually talked about before he

2169.41 --> 2181.02
can properly disagree he doesn't like

2173.73 --> 2183.38
people to experience and just ideas and

2181.02 --> 2189.299
things that is weird

2183.38 --> 2196.589
no he does if he's if he knows things

2189.299 --> 2199.29
about it but let me say he's just a when

2196.589 --> 2201.42
he touches upon a new subject and he

2199.29 --> 2205.14
approves then he died unto it and he

2201.42 --> 2207.4500000000003
just recycles it and thinks out every

2205.14 --> 2211.4
freaking detail to that thing but he's

2207.45 --> 2215.069
not very grabby to get new subjects it

2211.4 --> 2217.23
as where and it's understandable because

2215.069 --> 2219.93
he's just very thorough with what he

2217.23 --> 2221.849
deals with I think that's what happens

2219.93 --> 2225.72
though Arwen when you build a series of

2221.849 --> 2228.7490000000003
gotchas to question people and don't let

2225.72 --> 2230.6699999999996
people talk then you then you trop

2228.749 --> 2231.5389999999998
yourself paying yourself into that

2230.67 --> 2234.299
calling yourself

2231.539 --> 2237.8390000000004
well yes obvious if you've got a hammer

2234.299 --> 2247.2
then you start to look like a nail so

2237.839 --> 2251.359
that happens but yeah it's his own

2247.2 --> 2259.2889999999998
problem you know yesterday deal to learn

2251.359 --> 2261.8089999999997
learn to deal with that sorry yeah shout

2259.289 --> 2265.8190000000004
out to dunk my good friend in chat there

2261.809 --> 2265.8190000000004
I love you too

2267.019 --> 2286.41
shout out to mrs. B that's Karen be no

2273.18 --> 2290.0989999999997
relation so what do you want to talk

2286.41 --> 2295.14
about well you ever talked about why

2290.099 --> 2298.1090000000004
people come on and that like I can't

2295.14 --> 2300.39
just to talk about Ross yeah I come on

2298.109 --> 2301.92
to talk to people in the afternoon don't

2300.39 --> 2303.749
particularly have much to do in the

2301.92 --> 2307.71
afternoon plenty to do in the morning

2303.749 --> 2309.66
and night so and I'm interested in

2307.71 --> 2316.559
people that have different belief

2309.66 --> 2319.3489999999997
systems right I'll sell my more

2316.559 --> 2322.3190000000004
surprised by what people will believe in

2319.349 --> 2326.9990000000003
so what better way to find out and

2322.319 --> 2330.779
talking to people depends on your angle

2326.999 --> 2332.999
because it's not really hard to believe

2330.779 --> 2336.359
in anything no matter how crazy it is it

2332.999 --> 2340.2
is much more about the structure of the

2336.359 --> 2343.97
belief within your life balance like

2340.2 --> 2348.8399999999997
what position is it taking in us

2343.97 --> 2353.85
religion can be very important spiritual

2348.84 --> 2357.1200000000003
decision drive element like it can guide

2353.85 --> 2359.37
you and without it yeah you can feel

2357.12 --> 2360.21
like nothing means anything or it's all

2359.37 --> 2362.73
for nothing

2360.21 --> 2365.76
that's like purpose purpose is very

2362.73 --> 2368.78
important as a drive for the human

2365.76 --> 2373.26
spirit to keep on going and religion

2368.78 --> 2375.36
just outright gives that says it gives

2373.26 --> 2379.0200000000004
it and you can if you believe in it then

2375.36 --> 2381.15
it does actually work in a psychological

2379.02 --> 2383.7599999999998
sense even though the beliefs themselves

2381.15 --> 2389.1600000000003
might not make any sense and have any

2383.76 --> 2399.84
sense to outsiders so yeah that's how I

2389.16 --> 2402.5699999999997
see people believe for a reason but

2399.84 --> 2408.75
people believe in all kinds of things

2402.57 --> 2411.7200000000003
not only there's a lot of there's a lot

2408.75 --> 2415.01
of religions there's a lot of medical

2411.72 --> 2420.93
claims you know that people believe in

2415.01 --> 2426.8700000000003
it's strange that people still so much

2420.93 --> 2429.27
belief in things with no proof well if

2426.87 --> 2432.69
you don't know much about how things

2429.27 --> 2436.5
work then you're much easier much more

2432.69 --> 2439.14
inclined to believe anything about that

2436.5 --> 2442.26
so if you just don't have any idea how

2439.14 --> 2446.1299999999997
it works like say for example and a

2442.26 --> 2448.8900000000003
really average standard person would

2446.13 --> 2451.32
just trust a doctor and then if they lab

2448.89 --> 2453.92
like oh my god like it's really

2451.32 --> 2458.4
completely wrong they were just like oh

2453.92 --> 2461.13
no that means it's all wrong now I mean

2458.4 --> 2463.83
we may believe anything like them do the

2461.13 --> 2466.83
craziest thing because they don't have

2463.83 --> 2469.0499999999997
really the senses or they just trusted

2466.83 --> 2470.7
on the doctor and they didn't actually

2469.05 --> 2474.0600000000004
figure it out themselves they didn't

2470.7 --> 2477.39
learn anything about it and then yeah if

2474.06 --> 2479.73
you suddenly drop your source of trust

2477.39 --> 2481.44
yeah anything can happen because you

2479.73 --> 2484.02
have no expertise to compare it with

2481.44 --> 2486.84
what you're dealing with it's quite an

2484.02 --> 2488.64
interesting observation you know you

2486.84 --> 2491.28
can't be an expert in everything I mean

2488.64 --> 2493.2
I of install you can become an expert

2491.28 --> 2497.07
you can't you can't become Electric

2493.2 --> 2499.5299999999997
bands in everything expected to be there

2497.07 --> 2501.29
you have to grow it yesterday yeah this

2499.53 --> 2504.9300000000003
is the puzzling thing I find about

2501.29 --> 2508.65
flutter face people think they're an

2504.93 --> 2514.6099999999997
expert in everything or not but by this

2508.65 --> 2514.61
measure you say I think they do I mean

2516.02 --> 2523.56
some people you know you mentioned a

2519.03 --> 2526.6200000000003
subjective let's deal with tell me he'll

2523.56 --> 2528.81
argue with me on any given subject right

2526.62 --> 2531.6
what do you mean it's what he does yeah

2528.81 --> 2533.73
he's a lawyer but it doesn't his focus

2531.6 --> 2536.0699999999997
that's his talent that's what he does

2533.73 --> 2539.61
but it doesn't it doesn't question

2536.07 --> 2541.9500000000003
flutter of clams as much as he quest

2539.61 --> 2545.31
oh no well he does regularly even on the

2541.95 --> 2547.4399999999996
show up to in my opinion absurd

2545.31 --> 2550.68
proportions where you even suggest oh

2547.44 --> 2552.84
look if this may not turn out to be as

2550.68 --> 2555.54
I'm expecting it right down I might turn

2552.84 --> 2557.67
to the globe like yeah Anthony says that

2555.54 --> 2560.19
[ __ ] nobody else does that so that's

2557.67 --> 2564.9
just wrong should we do it absolutely

2560.19 --> 2568.07
does I don't think he questions it as

2564.9 --> 2571.77
closely as he questions global claims I

2568.07 --> 2573.84
think doesn't question it as much as you

2571.77 --> 2576.59
want him to compare up see with the

2573.84 --> 2580.32
globe club's first statement yeah

2576.59 --> 2588.27
if you look in chat right now vegan GUI

2580.32 --> 2593.04
says allenbys paid by Nathan I've yet to

2588.27 --> 2600.89
receive a check I don't care where did

2593.04 --> 2604.38
you get your check working on it smile

2600.89 --> 2606.0899999999997
where's my check see this is what's

2604.38 --> 2611.6600000000003
weird about the conspiracy world isn't

2606.09 --> 2611.6600000000003
it and Besser says Allenby is just a lie

2612.0 --> 2617.5
Wow yeah I'd like to get a cut in that

2615.849 --> 2618.099
Chuck I don't hey nobody givin me a

2617.5 --> 2621.22
check

2618.099 --> 2627.4
where's my cut yeah where's your coat

2621.22 --> 2630.299
chocolate word a little working on my

2627.4 --> 2635.609
money so do you think the conspira-con

2630.299 --> 2635.609
spirital mind can be on Althea all Arwen

2636.089 --> 2642.94
yeah of course it can be especially if

2640.42 --> 2647.38
you allow yourself to oversimplify

2642.94 --> 2650.17
things and it gets really emotional

2647.38 --> 2652.569
about these Oprah's oversimplified

2650.17 --> 2656.109
approaches that's when things get

2652.569 --> 2660.279
damaging do you think having a mindset

2656.109 --> 2666.029
of not trusting anything helps or

2660.279 --> 2671.109
hinders helps helps helps with what

2666.029 --> 2673.63
everyday life everyday everyday life of

2671.109 --> 2676.23
just living a normal life if you try out

2673.63 --> 2681.789
nothing no absolutely not

2676.23 --> 2684.789
but it's very useful to know to what

2681.789 --> 2688.65
level and what depth you can trust

2684.789 --> 2693.039
people and things by understanding them

2688.65 --> 2696.75
you know I trust you to do as I know

2693.039 --> 2701.23
that you will do I trust him that I

2696.75 --> 2703.029
rests on that knowledge I can or I could

2701.23 --> 2705.64
plan with that knowledge that's how I do

2703.029 --> 2708.43
it I don't fully trust you like I would

2705.64 --> 2710.23
a friend I don't even know your face but

2708.43 --> 2711.3999999999996
we don't read all this weird elements to

2710.23 --> 2715.359
it but that's another matter

2711.4 --> 2718.26
I trust you to do as you do yeah but

2715.359 --> 2722.38
that speaks to another matter within the

2718.26 --> 2725.289
fa community and perhaps all online

2722.38 --> 2732.19
communities we're not really friends are

2725.289 --> 2736.2990000000004
we well in the true sense in the true

2732.19 --> 2738.67
sense but how many people even have

2736.299 --> 2741.19
friends in the true sense any more in

2738.67 --> 2743.85
this world anyone I've probably got

2741.19 --> 2745.77
about 10 you're another

2743.85 --> 2748.38
guy so that's different you're from

2745.77 --> 2750.05
another generation do you think it's

2748.38 --> 2753.0
it's different for younger generations

2750.05 --> 2756.42
yes it is absolutely

2753.0 --> 2760.05
oh so because it's much more superficial

2756.42 --> 2761.94
and people have been growing up in a

2760.05 --> 2764.48
culture where it is encouraged to

2761.94 --> 2768.21
basically only care about yourself and

2764.48 --> 2769.92
draw people as soon as they disagree or

2768.21 --> 2772.29
break up as soon as you don't like

2769.92 --> 2776.4
something that kind of [ __ ] and that has

2772.29 --> 2781.83
a massive influence on everyone in these

2776.4 --> 2787.37
new generations they don't have as close

2781.83 --> 2790.02
friends as people used I mean back

2787.37 --> 2795.06
slamming has become like a school level

2790.02 --> 2796.74
habit it's crazy it's not way back in

2795.06 --> 2798.75
the day friendship meant a little bit

2796.74 --> 2801.06
more like you had to go to your friend's

2798.75 --> 2803.28
house and hang out with them there you

2801.06 --> 2804.7799999999997
know you have to go find people to know

2803.28 --> 2806.67
where people work now everything's

2804.78 --> 2809.28
Instagram and Facebook and everything's

2806.67 --> 2811.17
text message and all that so the world

2809.28 --> 2818.1000000000004
is completely different it's very

2811.17 --> 2819.75
impersonal it's an interesting

2818.1 --> 2822.89
interaction there another thought about

2819.75 --> 2824.42
it that's what I'm here for

2822.89 --> 2829.2799999999997
[Music]

2824.42 --> 2829.28
that's the question and I showed answer

2829.539 --> 2834.98
huh unless I asked that to get it into

2833.24 --> 2840.4399999999996
the panel so I'm sending him illegit

2834.98 --> 2842.96
about the show is almost over though but

2840.44 --> 2844.789
yeah I was a little late

2842.96 --> 2846.589
I might continue a little longer I don't

2844.789 --> 2849.1090000000004
know let's see I like it

2846.589 --> 2854.599
finally something to talk about that's

2849.109 --> 2859.549
why I need guests even Ellen B is I'm a

2854.599 --> 2864.46
good cast yes you're fine I trust you to

2859.549 --> 2864.46
be a good guide to have breakfast with

2865.329 --> 2875.6600000000003
yes I am I don't mind being shown to

2869.51 --> 2880.3590000000004
that well then don't get into the fiery

2875.66 --> 2885.2
debate panel because that's gonna happen

2880.359 --> 2887.89
hey ma soeur hey welcome to the panel

2885.2 --> 2889.8999999999996
yeah the show is almost running out of

2887.89 --> 2892.64
your mind

2889.9 --> 2894.589
I appreciate the shows on those that's a

2892.64 --> 2896.839
sponsor to ask Garland does he see this

2894.589 --> 2898.49
the expect those to believe but this is

2896.839 --> 2899.5
how he spends his time as a normal

2898.49 --> 2904.069
person

2899.5 --> 2907.039
well I've been doing this three four

2904.069 --> 2909.049
years you know go try to record I don't

2907.039 --> 2911.2400000000002
expect you to if you've got two

2909.049 --> 2913.849
conspiratorial minded I expect you to

2911.24 --> 2917.66
believe that but Alan do you know what

2913.849 --> 2920.299
belief it is you got a track record I

2917.66 --> 2922.7599999999998
don't have to be a conspiracy to not

2920.299 --> 2927.74
believe somebody you know you don't want

2922.76 --> 2929.42
more like the trickster yeah Alan you

2927.74 --> 2932.27
makin silly claims listen the reason the

2929.42 --> 2933.859
cable say it is if you think that any of

2932.27 --> 2935.66
those believes that you're just theaters

2933.859 --> 2938.779
a normal person I'm this is how you

2935.66 --> 2941.93
spend your time you are a bad liar man

2938.779 --> 2948.13
that's why you won't show your face no

2941.93 --> 2950.75
Alan if anything is a very good liar is

2948.13 --> 2954.079
socialized without needing to lie and

2950.75 --> 2955.549
that's Talent stuff when can I be she

2954.079 --> 2958.94
ate that talent even though it's

2955.549 --> 2960.05
nefarious and it's the real news in the

2958.94 --> 2962.84
islands on

2960.05 --> 2965.3300000000004
hmm can I tell you the real reason I

2962.84 --> 2967.2200000000003
think I'm Dahlia to influence everyone

2965.33 --> 2968.93
no because he's desperate because his

2967.22 --> 2970.52
belief systems don't see the greater he

2968.93 --> 2973.49
does not offer humble and this is the

2970.52 --> 2974.99
only way he can deal with it what if I

2973.49 --> 2977.6899999999996
was to tell you I don't have a belief

2974.99 --> 2979.58
