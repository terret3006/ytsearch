53.25 --> 58.59
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

56.91 --> 60.18

60.18 --> 65.45
I'm going live which is normally 2 p.m.

62.79 --> 68.61
I'm so damn time every day but today

65.45 --> 73.79
yeah I started decided to start a little

68.61 --> 79.08
early right so the weather today is

73.79 --> 84.03
really nice it's a bit cloudy too

79.08 --> 92.4
sometimes but now it's really right

84.03 --> 94.38
sunny a mild wind the only issue I have

92.4 --> 98.7
currently is that over there there's

94.38 --> 100.89
some truck doing some weird industrial

98.7 --> 104.88
cleaning processor whatever on the roof

100.89 --> 107.119
of that freaking Church I used to go and

104.88 --> 112.47
it's doing that all day and making this

107.119 --> 115.74
a bearable freakin noise I even now with

112.47 --> 118.86
the window completely closed it's doable

115.74 --> 125.82
with this temperature it's still I hear

118.86 --> 127.72
it zooming if I like I'll just try to so

125.82 --> 130.73999999999998
yeah

127.72 --> 130.74
that's just freakin great

135.85 --> 141.29
so let's see who is in chat probably not

139.73 --> 146.98999999999998
a lot because I started really early

141.29 --> 150.26
right hey James Mason righteous force

146.99 --> 150.98000000000002
and red pill philosophy hey good to see

150.26 --> 153.29
you there

150.98 --> 159.6
I guess the Bell notification actually

153.29 --> 162.60999999999999
worked this time thanks for joining

159.6 --> 166.72
[Music]

162.61 --> 166.72000000000003
let's see what's going on

167.65 --> 173.01000000000002
all right what have I been up to

174.73 --> 180.39999999999998
yeah digging through lots of news and

176.92 --> 182.53
stuff throwing that into the letter at

180.4 --> 186.94
the earlybird chat all directions

182.53 --> 190.54
medical few let's see

186.94 --> 197.62
just dig through it yeah like a cure for

190.54 --> 199.54
Alzheimer apparently was just not was

197.62 --> 203.5
suppressed by the company that basically

199.54 --> 210.099
invented it that was one thing that

203.5 --> 210.79
happened pretty sick oh yeah that's it

210.099 --> 217.0
Hey

210.79 --> 220.599
oh and I've figured out how to what my

217.0 --> 224.17
name would be like in elven like Tolkien

220.599 --> 226.82899999999998
Elvin writing it's pretty funny see if I

224.17 --> 226.82899999999998
could share that

228.939 --> 237.519
not to create on the resolution alright

233.84 --> 237.519
so that's what it looks like

238.21 --> 246.18900000000002
[Music]

240.349 --> 246.189
that's our wind so

246.459 --> 255.37
yeah I've been thinking like I don't

250.03 --> 260.88
know maybe I he do kind of like want an

255.37 --> 268.03000000000003
icon of some kind but it's very tough to

260.88 --> 271.56
think up of some think up something yeah

268.03 --> 271.55999999999995
I could go pretty wild with it

275.57 --> 280.25
but yeah maybe I should have one

281.33 --> 289.59
besides basically the YouTube I could

283.83 --> 293.31
have that evany tree yeah okay well I

289.59 --> 298.67999999999995
did go to own Benjamin yesterday it was

293.31 --> 301.44
okay then I decided to make a I guess

298.68 --> 305.93
what Owen would regard as like lesser

301.44 --> 308.96999999999997
wizardry a joke where I was basically

305.93 --> 310.89
pretending at first to be a globe or

308.97 --> 313.14000000000004
saying oh no no it all works out

310.89 --> 316.34999999999997
perfectly with the moon shadow he got

313.14 --> 318.24
really worked up about that and I

316.35 --> 321.24
started like now they may actually be

318.24 --> 323.16
right but he apparently didn't read

321.24 --> 326.91
beyond that because after that I said

323.16 --> 331.59000000000003
but yeah that kind of pales to the fact

326.91 --> 333.39000000000004
that the moon just disappears from sight

331.59 --> 334.10999999999996
and has no shadow from the Sun

333.39 --> 338.58
whatsoever

334.11 --> 342.09000000000003
within that time and that makes no damn

338.58 --> 345.51
sense at all and the just even the moon

342.09 --> 349.58
phases so he didn't read it and now he

345.51 --> 349.58
got all pissed off and I got banned and

351.08 --> 357.99
yeah I'm pretty pissed off about that

354.62 --> 361.17
that's like yeah okay Owen Benjamin bans

357.99 --> 366.96000000000004
anyone but I don't really like this

361.17 --> 373.08000000000004
because I was basically making a a joke

366.96 --> 377.01
on his own side what well if he doesn't

373.08 --> 379.12
want me in his chat anymore fine that's

377.01 --> 383.889
what he wants

379.12 --> 383.889
just things I'm annoying all right

386.99 --> 390.089
[Music]

397.59 --> 406.419
no-no-no GFB 45 I don't like banning

402.129 --> 409.03000000000003
people but sometimes I just have to ban

406.419 --> 411.69899999999996
people because they get out of control

409.03 --> 413.5
and they literally ruin every room the

411.699 --> 416.02000000000004
atmosphere and start to dominate [ __ ]

413.5 --> 417.789
well in Owen Benjamin's jet that's not

416.02 --> 420.729
even really possible because there's

417.789 --> 425.099
such a wave of people just talking all

420.729 --> 428.59
the time and there is a space in between

425.099 --> 430.06
yeah you have to wait like a minute or

428.59 --> 434.04999999999995
something in between every comment

430.06 --> 436.599
anyway no but yeah Owen he really likes

434.05 --> 437.819
to ban people and apparently everyone

436.599 --> 446.59
think that's really funny

437.819 --> 448.8
so yeah you know it's just that I don't

446.59 --> 451.96
know I do consider myself pretty much a

448.8 --> 456.93
pretty big fan of his and I feel like

451.96 --> 456.93
stepped on the dick like this like dude

463.49 --> 469.759
yeah yeah indeed thanks James Mason I

467.169 --> 473.84
usually just put people in timeout

469.759 --> 475.58000000000004
unless it's just timeout is not enough

473.84 --> 478.96999999999997
because they obviously would just keep

475.58 --> 488.3
on going exactly as they were right

478.97 --> 491.68
after after the timeout runs out so is

488.3 --> 495.83
that it you think James Mason that is

491.68 --> 499.97
look I'm not even that funny okay and if

495.83 --> 502.25
people think I'm funny then I tend to

499.97 --> 506.66
kind of expect that they're laughing at

502.25 --> 509.289
me not with me and I don't know I'm used

506.66 --> 509.28900000000004
to that [ __ ]

521.93 --> 528.9499999999999
but no yeah I know I know thanks James

525.59 --> 536.21
Mason that was pretty clear it's not

528.95 --> 539.0
like the chat is getting snowed under no

536.21 --> 547.88
but maybe you're right maybe for some

539.0 --> 549.59
reason I don't know it it feels so like

547.88 --> 551.42
he doesn't even want me to do that kind

549.59 --> 554.36
of [ __ ] I don't think he likes me

551.42 --> 555.86
talking about him because maybe I reveal

554.36 --> 560.44
things that he doesn't want to be

555.86 --> 563.69
revealed because it kind of like breaks

560.44 --> 566.3900000000001
his momentum in what he's doing and I

563.69 --> 569.1800000000001
don't want to ruin that you know let him

566.39 --> 573.23
do what he wants to do the way he sees

569.18 --> 575.78
fit that's all fine but maybe he does

573.23 --> 578.78
feel kind of threatened that I do have

575.78 --> 584.51
also a bility to just especially in chat

578.78 --> 588.47
really concisely put words together even

584.51 --> 590.45
better than life when I'm talking and

588.47 --> 592.07
maybe he feels that and he does feel

590.45 --> 594.2900000000001
kind of threatened or he thinks that I'm

592.07 --> 597.0500000000001
there to basically try to manipulate him

594.29 --> 600.56
in some direction or something because I

597.05 --> 602.99
well he assured that was make / that it

600.56 --> 603.4899999999999
makes perfect sense that he would feel

602.99 --> 607.34
that way

603.49 --> 610.1
cause a lot of people that he gets faced

607.34 --> 616.4200000000001
off with are like that I think

610.1 --> 616.4200000000001
especially over the Internet so

624.05 --> 630.5699999999999
but yeah I don't know the feeling I got

628.709 --> 632.9899999999999
from it mostly it's just a big

630.57 --> 632.99
disappointment

645.99 --> 651.96
yeah

647.59 --> 651.96
[Music]

655.0 --> 658.74
also I don't know

659.49 --> 667.319
you you know what let's just do this

663.54 --> 669.509
let's just get raw I don't really like

667.319 --> 672.3789999999999
every every single one of his jokes

669.509 --> 676.35
sometimes I think they're really stale

672.379 --> 679.35
although yeah definitely a handful are

676.35 --> 681.6890000000001
just freakin amazing in some way some

679.35 --> 684.9590000000001
they really just pushed the boundary in

681.689 --> 688.199
a way and it works creates this giggly

684.959 --> 691.319
energy sort of a mania feeling that's

688.199 --> 695.309
funny but not everything he does is that

691.319 --> 701.61
funny sometimes I get the feeling he

695.309 --> 704.429
almost just I don't know maybe maybe

701.61 --> 707.49
he's overestimating himself maybe he's

704.429 --> 709.439
getting like a weird artist feeling like

707.49 --> 713.85
okay everything I do is automatically

709.439 --> 717.569
funny I don't know but I get that

713.85 --> 720.509
feeling sometimes but ya do at the same

717.569 --> 724.4989999999999
time you know I'm not gonna like poopoo

720.509 --> 727.1
anything he does because ya years of

724.499 --> 730.019
real cookies a professional basically

727.1 --> 731.73
with this dedications and he does have a

730.019 --> 734.189
family and he does all the work and he

731.73 --> 737.129
is going to be under strain and it's all

734.189 --> 739.11
a big test and I think that the overall

737.129 --> 743.249
pressure level and energy level that he

739.11 --> 747.269
deals with outweighs me and I am

743.249 --> 750.839
definitely aware of that all right I'm

747.269 --> 755.089
not trying to like sivanna you or how do

750.839 --> 755.089
you in any way so

758.87 --> 762.049
[Music]

764.1 --> 767.64
[Music]

765.73 --> 769.279
anyway

767.64 --> 774.319
[Music]

769.279 --> 776.689
just a little disappointing yeah yeah

774.319 --> 781.91
George Carlin was amazing indeed Jeffrey

776.689 --> 789.649
bill what I do think Owen is funny he's

781.91 --> 794.029
just not always funny and the weird

789.649 --> 798.259
thing is he's probably aware of the of

794.029 --> 799.819
the in and out of it but he doesn't

798.259 --> 801.379
really know how to deal with it I think

799.819 --> 804.61
that's just the way he does things

801.379 --> 811.629
because it's been very persistent

804.61 --> 811.629
it's not like a progress regress thing

811.93 --> 818.3599999999999
it really seems to be part of how he is

815.18 --> 823.0089999999999
and I get that because I have my own

818.36 --> 825.5600000000001
balance with how I am even in this

823.009 --> 827.839
relatively low output and I yeah

825.56 --> 833.149
basically none of you ever have really

827.839 --> 837.0500000000001
even seen me on on a like serious the

833.149 --> 838.79
serious full-power are wind you've seen

837.05 --> 840.8599999999999
our winni in a rage maybe and you've

838.79 --> 845.18
seen me like really hyped up about

840.86 --> 849.0790000000001
things but that's nothing like big

845.18 --> 850.399
projects and because I wouldn't have the

849.079 --> 852.439
time to fool around

850.399 --> 856.129
I would basically shut all doors and

852.439 --> 859.79
become absolutely single-minded like I'm

856.129 --> 861.9490000000001
doing this and anyone who tries to

859.79 --> 866.059
basically dissuade me will get a really

861.949 --> 868.49
angry look that kind of [ __ ] and it

866.059 --> 871.73
happened before it happened when I met

868.49 --> 873.889
my ex I just like it's like yeah

871.73 --> 875.089
nobody's gonna stop this [ __ ] or they

873.889 --> 877.1800000000001
gotta be in big trouble

875.089 --> 877.1800000000001
and

878.529 --> 884.739
you yeah women women tend to do that but

882.489 --> 889.659
other there yeah there's other things as

884.739 --> 892.859
well let's see yeah my goldsmithing I

889.659 --> 897.549
was really dead definitely dedicated and

892.859 --> 899.889
I basically quit that school because I

897.549 --> 901.809
was confident enough in my skills and it

899.889 --> 905.199
was basically approaching it

901.809 --> 907.449
pragmatically from and being very

905.199 --> 909.279
conscious about my own skills and about

907.449 --> 911.439
what is gonna happen what is gonna

909.279 --> 914.919
progress however the social ties gonna

911.439 --> 916.5989999999999
narrow down with these especially with

914.919 --> 920.769
the teachers and there was just no way

916.599 --> 922.989
that it would yield anything more than

920.769 --> 931.439
just wasting my time costing more money

922.989 --> 935.859
and gathering more filth in my soul and

931.439 --> 938.309
in no way and I definitely did start my

935.859 --> 941.229
company but again yeah I got too

938.309 --> 945.759
hammered on the skill it's like

941.229 --> 950.1890000000001
obsessive go yeah and I didn't pay

945.759 --> 950.189
attention to the company so

952.3 --> 960.75
and I didn't have a lot of ways to go

957.67 --> 963.4599999999999
add like the only way I could have even

960.75 --> 965.56
tried to do that the weird thing is I

963.46 --> 968.01
had I was actually considering it and

965.56 --> 970.6899999999999
then I met my ex and completely

968.01 --> 977.11
completely lost track of EDA ceccolini

970.69 --> 979.9300000000001
thing to go with that but if I hadn't

977.11 --> 981.79
then I probably have a job so I'm not

979.93 --> 984.5799999999999
gonna blame her because yeah it's not

981.79 --> 987.13
really well it is her fault but not it's

984.58 --> 994.21
not like she had a choice and was me who

987.13 --> 995.71
did who yeah who did that and yeah I

994.21 --> 997.69
would have probably have gone to

995.71 --> 1000.9300000000001
business school with it wouldn't have

997.69 --> 1004.4100000000001
even cost me that much and that would

1000.93 --> 1006.92
have definitely put me in a different

1004.41 --> 1006.92
position now

1011.829 --> 1018.4699999999999
but yeah now I just got a climb out of

1015.38 --> 1020.12
this and I am getting familiar branching

1018.47 --> 1024.53
out in all kinds of directions that I

1020.12 --> 1026.959
had never expected I would and I'm still

1024.53 --> 1028.8999999999999
considering still it's like every day

1026.959 --> 1033.439
I'm starting to think about okay what

1028.9 --> 1036.199
type of job is out there and how could I

1033.439 --> 1038.5690000000002
get in there that would be sustainable

1036.199 --> 1043.52
for me or that would still leave enough

1038.569 --> 1047.9289999999999
maneuvering room to grow within it how

1043.52 --> 1051.5
do I get there how do I reach that

1047.929 --> 1054.2900000000002
momentum where do I seek it out and I've

1051.5 --> 1060.35
also been a thanks again south beam

1054.29 --> 1062.299
thanks for the superjet donation so yeah

1060.35 --> 1066.6399999999999
I've actually been working out a little

1062.299 --> 1066.6399999999999
and that was kind of weird

1069.12 --> 1077.4799999999998
because while my body really appreciated

1071.94 --> 1079.919
it and maybe I haven't done enough of it

1077.48 --> 1082.6200000000001
but then again yeah it's also the food

1079.919 --> 1084.8400000000001
issue ah man I'm starting to sound like

1082.62 --> 1087.809
a whining old lady it's getting really

1084.84 --> 1090.27
annoying but yeah I'm starting starting

1087.809 --> 1098.36
to work out I try to eat a little bit

1090.27 --> 1101.6589999999999
more because you need to do that and no

1098.36 --> 1108.149
I'm actually embarrassingly enough

1101.659 --> 1111.3600000000001
considering using like one of the social

1108.149 --> 1114.149
options there's like this thing if

1111.36 --> 1116.58
you're on social welfare you get like a

1114.149 --> 1118.7399999999998
pass and then there's all kinds of

1116.58 --> 1121.799
things you can get discounts to or even

1118.74 --> 1124.46
like things for free and it's like I've

1121.799 --> 1129.51
always like outright rejected that just

1124.46 --> 1132.89
no services a weenie stuff but maybe

1129.51 --> 1136.049
there is something that I could get like

1132.89 --> 1138.539
free access to a gym just to try it out

1136.049 --> 1143.8799999999999
because I've never actually done

1138.539 --> 1145.86
anything like that I've only done sports

1143.88 --> 1148.46
in the past off thank God that damn

1145.86 --> 1148.4599999999998
thing is off

1150.03 --> 1159.0
Oh fresh air no more noise alright

1157.08 --> 1167.34
two-hand hello by the way and

1159.0 --> 1177.29
mind-warped Daniel and James Mays middle

1167.34 --> 1184.1699999999998
road blackguard Geoffrey bill Sean G

1177.29 --> 1186.48
anyway yeah it's just like if I don't

1184.17 --> 1189.93
get out there and do something even if

1186.48 --> 1192.6
to me it seems like an inferior way to

1189.93 --> 1196.38
spend my time and that's just it's

1192.6 --> 1200.3999999999999
stupid negative judgment from my part

1196.38 --> 1203.88
it's it's not very constructive so I

1200.4 --> 1205.77
must ignore this this counterweight

1203.88 --> 1209.0100000000002
against going to do that and just go out

1205.77 --> 1210.66
there do stuff that although it seems

1209.01 --> 1213.12
useless at least there may be

1210.66 --> 1215.4
opportunity to basically get a look at

1213.12 --> 1217.77
other people and then focus on whatever

1215.4 --> 1219.5400000000002
it's like okay either I focus on the

1217.77 --> 1222.81
people around me if the energy just

1219.54 --> 1225.75
happens to reach out or I just focus on

1222.81 --> 1229.05
my own building and if I can do that for

1225.75 --> 1232.92
free and basically keep myself fed

1229.05 --> 1234.93
enough I'm not sure I can do that just

1232.92 --> 1237.14
yet because I'm still trying to climb

1234.93 --> 1243.45
out the of the idea the Google

1237.14 --> 1246.3200000000002
disappointment then yeah who knows where

1243.45 --> 1246.32
I can go from there

1250.7 --> 1257.3
yeah ahead step booth yeah that's a

1254.45 --> 1259.49
little bit too much for me look I'm

1257.3 --> 1263.09
never gonna be a freakin bodybuilder I'm

1259.49 --> 1267.2
never gonna be like a gymnastics type of

1263.09 --> 1270.77
guy again I used to be that a little but

1267.2 --> 1273.38
my physical talents mostly lie in my

1270.77 --> 1278.48
reflexes because still to this day my

1273.38 --> 1280.67
reflexes are just insanely quick but

1278.48 --> 1284.1100000000001
those are like shock reef yeah shock

1280.67 --> 1287.3600000000001
moments like really quick sudden things

1284.11 --> 1290.05
but when it comes to like really pushing

1287.36 --> 1294.02
the limits of every part of my body I

1290.05 --> 1296.87
don't know my body doesn't really like

1294.02 --> 1299.15
that a lot and I could probably if I had

1296.87 --> 1300.8
enough money just supplement my way all

1299.15 --> 1302.8600000000001
to compensate for that and then

1300.8 --> 1305.21
eventually turned into a big muscle guy

1302.86 --> 1306.9199999999998
but I don't know if that's even that

1305.21 --> 1309.5
good because I've had I tried that

1306.92 --> 1316.1000000000001
before and then I got I got back

1309.5 --> 1318.34
problems from that you know but who

1316.1 --> 1321.29
knows maybe it can get a bit more

1318.34 --> 1323.03
professional about it and really study

1321.29 --> 1326.6599999999999
up on these specific techniques it's

1323.03 --> 1333.34
just that I never I never really liked

1326.66 --> 1333.3400000000001
that sounds stupid maybe if

1334.039 --> 1338.879
maybe if I had some hormonal incentive

1337.289 --> 1349.83
that I would pay more a little more

1338.879 --> 1353.6689999999999
attention or something anyway yeah I do

1349.83 --> 1361.759
still appreciate just that I am kind of

1353.669 --> 1365.419
slender but not like really like super

1361.759 --> 1365.419
tiny or anything

1373.28 --> 1379.01
oh yeah I completely forgot to mention

1375.38 --> 1380.72
got to marry coffee and tea yesterday I

1379.01 --> 1383.99
didn't even touch the tea because it was

1380.72 --> 1385.76
way too hot to drink tea because I just

1383.99 --> 1392.54
started sweating with that rule with

1385.76 --> 1397.04
that heavy heat oh yeah by the way I saw

1392.54 --> 1399.08
red pill philosophy poppin earlier I was

1397.04 --> 1404.21
wondering if perhaps he would like to

1399.08 --> 1405.77
come come on my show but maybe he just

1404.21 --> 1409.3700000000001
said hello and he didn't really have

1405.77 --> 1411.23
time for that but that would be really

1409.37 --> 1414.86
cool to have him on just have a talk

1411.23 --> 1417.17
about whatever he likes could be

1414.86 --> 1422.4199999999998
anything he likes I'll basically give

1417.17 --> 1425.8000000000002
him give him the room if he likes or get

1422.42 --> 1425.8000000000002
into a discussion about anything

1429.77 --> 1437.36
hello flatlander Travis Clark and Jose

1441.91 --> 1444.51
yeah

1447.27 --> 1455.1299999999999
oh right middle in the middle road look

1450.57 --> 1458.1
back to sports yeah as a kid I was

1455.13 --> 1461.3700000000001
pretty damn fanatical about any type of

1458.1 --> 1462.6899999999998
game sports like football basketball all

1461.37 --> 1466.04
that stuff loved it

1462.69 --> 1468.96
and hey reflexes super nice for that I

1466.04 --> 1471.84
could probably still do it if I was

1468.96 --> 1475.08
supplemented enough but I'd never reach

1471.84 --> 1476.8799999999999
like yeah anything near like

1475.08 --> 1479.55
professional because I just don't have

1476.88 --> 1485.5500000000002
the condition for that and I never will

1479.55 --> 1488.79
I am NOT built for that [ __ ] green

1485.55 --> 1491.3999999999999
condition however you know I'm I'm just

1488.79 --> 1494.37
I don't know my stats arrange themselves

1491.4 --> 1497.8090000000002
for me to become a freakin wizard not a

1494.37 --> 1503.61
Mesmer but a wizard and not an athlete

1497.809 --> 1505.97
hey right red pill philosophy good good

1503.61 --> 1510.54
see you still that yeah if you want I

1505.97 --> 1512.82
I'd have to have you on skype I don't

1510.54 --> 1516.6
know if you are on skype but if you add

1512.82 --> 1518.6699999999998
me you can find my skype address in the

1516.6 --> 1521.28
in the description box below it's like

1518.67 --> 1524.5800000000002
the first thing you see then you can add

1521.28 --> 1526.6789999999999
me and I'll call you in if you want look

1524.58 --> 1530.73
if you're like yeah yet work or

1526.679 --> 1535.0700000000002
something you know you don't have to but

1530.73 --> 1535.07
it would be really cool to have you on

1542.92 --> 1548.5600000000002
and look if it doesn't work out we could

1546.22 --> 1551.38
always arrange for you to come on a

1548.56 --> 1553.21
night I'll show the num the infamous

1551.38 --> 1559.99
number free maybe it'll actually work

1553.21 --> 1562.21
out if you come on but I don't know it

1559.99 --> 1564.42
doesn't have to be today if you don't

1562.21 --> 1564.42
want

1579.57 --> 1587.01
what

1582.09 --> 1590.03
are you saying are when committing the

1587.01 --> 1590.03
cardinal sin

1594.14 --> 1604.3400000000001
what are you talking about no look I'm

1601.58 --> 1605.299
not saying oh I was destined to be a

1604.34 --> 1610.01
wizard

1605.299 --> 1611.96
No well maybe I am I don't know it but a

1610.01 --> 1614.74
wizard when I talk wizard

1611.96 --> 1621.23
I usually my first anchor point to that

1614.74 --> 1623.36
tends to be the the D&D game it's a

1621.23 --> 1625.82
class it's like different things you can

1623.36 --> 1627.8899999999999
become you can become a cleric if you

1625.82 --> 1630.9099999999999
have really great wisdom you can become

1627.89 --> 1634.45
a wizard if you have great intelligence

1630.91 --> 1636.74
but you have strength dexterity

1634.45 --> 1640.46
Constitution and you have charisma and

1636.74 --> 1642.83
that is more for for bards and

1640.46 --> 1648.5900000000001
storytellers and all that specifically

1642.83 --> 1653.4189999999999
charm and I'm just saying that the way

1648.59 --> 1656.57
my abilities arranged themselves I was

1653.419 --> 1660.0490000000002
just never meant to be an athlete like I

1656.57 --> 1664.04
have an okay Constitution especially for

1660.049 --> 1667.28
the lack of the yeah training investment

1664.04 --> 1669.62
that I've put into it although I did do

1667.28 --> 1672.41
a lot of that during my teenage times

1669.62 --> 1675.32
pretty much up to age of 17 and then I

1672.41 --> 1678.47
kind of stopped before that I was into a

1675.32 --> 1680.48
lot of sports I I started out

1678.47 --> 1682.46
horseback riding and I've been doing

1680.48 --> 1684.71
that for a very long time I was blessed

1682.46 --> 1687.83
that my parents would actually pay for

1684.71 --> 1691.3700000000001
that because it's not cheap but I do

1687.83 --> 1694.28
that and did gay did like competitions

1691.37 --> 1696.9189999999999
and everything and I also I tried judo

1694.28 --> 1699.5
little didn't work out didn't like being

1696.919 --> 1704.929
slung or float yeah flying around his

1699.5 --> 1709.91
ship so II yeah sorry for a late

1704.929 --> 1712.1000000000001
response cool wait let me finish and

1709.91 --> 1714.95
I'll call you

1712.1 --> 1716.9499999999998
and yeah after that Taekwondo Taekwondo

1714.95 --> 1720.74
pretty much came in when I was 12

1716.95 --> 1726.77
yeah I saw you I call you soon red pill

1720.74 --> 1729.35
philosophy and yeah Taekwondo so I did

1726.77 --> 1733.25
that also pretty seriously and I learned

1729.35 --> 1738.79
most of all to keep physical balance and

1733.25 --> 1743.06
I perfected my reflexes there also

1738.79 --> 1746.48
learned a lot of the preliminary stages

1743.06 --> 1750.59
of physical discipline basically keeping

1746.48 --> 1751.91
your physical responses to physical

1750.59 --> 1754.58
things under control if that is

1751.91 --> 1758.72
something I'm really good at but when it

1754.58 --> 1760.85
comes to the mind mind discipline is

1758.72 --> 1765.02
more difficult for me has always been a

1760.85 --> 1770.24
little bit more difficult for me but

1765.02 --> 1772.91
it's also because I've just have so much

1770.24 --> 1778.34
in my mind to deal with and the branched

1772.91 --> 1781.01
out so wide and discipline really works

1778.34 --> 1783.08
the best when whatever the discipline is

1781.01 --> 1786.16
about narrows down and I've basically

1783.08 --> 1789.1999999999998
refused to narrow down with my mind

1786.16 --> 1797.8300000000002
persistently it's like no nothing is

1789.2 --> 1797.8300000000002
gonna like make me retract my mind

1799.27 --> 1805.25
except for yeah like huge moments of

1803.15 --> 1810.92
pain and then just everything collapses

1805.25 --> 1812.96
and just but that's basically like total

1810.92 --> 1814.4
energy collapse anyway yeah I'll call

1812.96 --> 1818.57
you by the way thanks Wow

1814.4 --> 1821.69
mine worked for the 15 Australian

1818.57 --> 1823.52
dollars super chap donation I Arwen I

1821.69 --> 1825.14
can help you build a blog website where

1823.52 --> 1827.21
you can write everything that is on your

1825.14 --> 1829.88
mind implement adsense on it

1827.21 --> 1835.16
so talk about the things you love and

1829.88 --> 1838.2800000000002
make passive income well that's wait

1835.16 --> 1842.5700000000002
yeah you did talk about I am interested

1838.28 --> 1848.69
I am interested it's never bad to have a

1842.57 --> 1850.81
more more available and I'd love to hear

1848.69 --> 1854.3300000000002
about it

1850.81 --> 1856.76
my issue mostly with trying things out

1854.33 --> 1861.05
on the web is that I don't have a lot of

1856.76 --> 1863.81
patience with coding like I'm a sculptor

1861.05 --> 1867.56
with ideas but I don't like figuring out

1863.81 --> 1874.48
how programs work it's really stupid

1867.56 --> 1878.1499999999999
it's like I don't know I I guess I'm old

1874.48 --> 1880.55
because I'm from an era where I wasn't

1878.15 --> 1882.41
basically forced to constantly do that

1880.55 --> 1886.9099999999999
it's like now leave that to the

1882.41 --> 1890.69
programmers and most of the designing

1886.91 --> 1892.0700000000002
idea was still on paper okay anyway I

1890.69 --> 1895.13
will talk about that later I'm gonna

1892.07 --> 1900.07
because don't want to keep retro

1895.13 --> 1900.0700000000002
philosophy waiting I'll call you up

1982.09 --> 1989.02
like I was in the gravity issue then oh

1985.77 --> 1990.73
it was so so much happening last year in

1989.02 --> 1993.7
the summer on the Nathan Oakley show it

1990.73 --> 1997.21
was like they were just deciphering so

1993.7 --> 1999.3400000000001

1997.21 --> 2003.23
before you know listening to the Nathan

1999.34 --> 2006.27

2011.4 --> 2019.3500000000001
the offense I did oh my god on the fence

2014.94 --> 2022.169
I was on the fence up until like this

2019.35 --> 2025.53
three months ago and you know I've heard

2022.169 --> 2027.419
about Flat Earth since I think maybe

2025.53 --> 2031.4289999999999
late 2015

2027.419 --> 2033.66
if not early 2016 was when YouTube first

2031.429 --> 2038.97
recommended the first Flat Earth video

2033.66 --> 2040.26
to me and uh you know when I when I

2038.97 --> 2042.03
heard about it when I heard about Flat

2040.26 --> 2043.3799999999999
Earth I'm like okay I've always been

2042.03 --> 2044.36
pretty open-minded you know I've always

2043.38 --> 2048.53
been into like conch

2044.36 --> 2051.23
and simulation theory I've got videos on

2048.53 --> 2053.1490000000003
my channel going back to 2012 talking

2051.23 --> 2055.01
about you know simulation theory and

2053.149 --> 2057.25
whether or not react is a complete

2055.01 --> 2060.0200000000004
illusion you know some type of a

2057.25 --> 2060.44
consciousness centered matrix simulate

2060.02 --> 2064.7
right

2060.44 --> 2068.869
yeah the matrix cosmology concept yeah

2064.7 --> 2072.2
yeah absolutely which you know some

2068.869 --> 2074.179
people say there's physics that suggests

2072.2 --> 2076.54
we live in a simulation you know you get

2074.179 --> 2079.25
into like the quantum eraser experiment

2076.54 --> 2081.859
there's somebody who wrote a book called

2079.25 --> 2085.25
the holographic universe many many years

2081.859 --> 2088.25
ago man so allegedly there's science

2085.25 --> 2091.07
backing up that hypothesis about the

2088.25 --> 2092.149
simulation theory I don't really know

2091.07 --> 2095.75
what your thoughts are on that whole

2092.149 --> 2097.97
simulation oh well thank you first for

2095.75 --> 2105.23
ringing up such a complex question but

2097.97 --> 2107.29
oh look I am basically now on a new tier

2105.23 --> 2112.67
of discovery in the process and I'm

2107.29 --> 2115.19
basically using the yeah the scientific

2112.67 --> 2116.81
method handed down to me by John he's

2115.19 --> 2119.75
basically the one that came up with it

2116.81 --> 2120.859
although it yet when you literally say

2119.75 --> 2123.26
it like that he'll get pissed off

2120.859 --> 2125.5989999999997
because he didn't it's like the original

2123.26 --> 2128.96
scientific method that's become

2125.599 --> 2132.26
convoluted and kind of abandoned and

2128.96 --> 2135.44
ignored like yeah that's the older

2132.26 --> 2137.69
brother he's always being so annoyingly

2135.44 --> 2139.52
truthful let's kind of like put him in

2137.69 --> 2141.5
the corner yeah he started it all but

2139.52 --> 2145.369
we're gonna do our own thing the

2141.5 --> 2148.369
original scientific method and I'm

2145.369 --> 2150.17
starting to figure out where are all the

2148.369 --> 2153.1400000000003
presuppositions and I have a personal

2150.17 --> 2156.2200000000003
suspicion that for example quantum

2153.14 --> 2160.64
mechanics is actually spawned from

2156.22 --> 2164.7799999999997
mistakingly presupposition what the

2160.64 --> 2166.4
micro world is like I don't know about

2164.78 --> 2170.8100000000004
me about that because I have been

2166.4 --> 2173.599
talking about no I mean look I have been

2170.81 --> 2176.39
a huge fan of quantum physics for many

2173.599 --> 2177.6600000000003
years because when I heard the

2176.39 --> 2180.72
alternative

2177.66 --> 2183.1
interpretations of quantum physics that

2180.72 --> 2185.56
quantum physics proves consciousness

2183.1 --> 2188.5899999999997
quantum physics proves there's some type

2185.56 --> 2191.2
of underlying intelligence that buried

2188.59 --> 2193.86
that interested me because I've always

2191.2 --> 2197.98
felt that a deep intuitive level that

2193.86 --> 2202.09
there's more going on in this world than

2197.98 --> 2205.63
just mechanistic physical processes so

2202.09 --> 2207.4300000000003
yes right so I've been super into the

2205.63 --> 2209.8
quantum mechanical thing and I kind of

2207.43 --> 2211.48
did latch on to quantum physics because

2209.8 --> 2213.5800000000004
of the alternative explanations that it

2211.48 --> 2215.92
you know proves consciousness or

2213.58 --> 2218.5299999999997
whatever but I'm totally open minded to

2215.92 --> 2220.21
the possibility that like you say maybe

2218.53 --> 2222.8500000000004
all that [ __ ] is just based on a lot of

2220.21 --> 2225.07
presuppositions about how the quantum

2222.85 --> 2227.71
world so yeah I'm totally open minded to

2225.07 --> 2231.01
that right let me elaborate a little bit

2227.71 --> 2234.37
about that because there is things that

2231.01 --> 2236.1400000000003
the presuppose it's set up of quantum

2234.37 --> 2239.2
mechanics like for example the double

2236.14 --> 2241.5299999999997
slit experiment does prove and that is

2239.2 --> 2245.98
the weird thing because it kind of

2241.53 --> 2249.73
almost proves that there's more than

2245.98 --> 2252.13
just the physical world but yeah how you

2249.73 --> 2254.08
can't even pinpoint it it's very complex

2252.13 --> 2258.7200000000003
at it because it proves knowledge it

2254.08 --> 2261.8199999999997
proves that knowing can alter physical

2258.72 --> 2264.25
aspects basically that is what's really

2261.82 --> 2267.19
that's even actually the experiment

2264.25 --> 2268.51
itself it's not for example is this

2267.19 --> 2271.12
thing that they're doing is that

2268.51 --> 2274.1200000000003
particles or is that waves that's a

2271.12 --> 2277.8399999999997
complete red herring like a second-tier

2274.12 --> 2279.64
red herring and as it's not but then

2277.84 --> 2282.76
again it's free supposed to be a

2279.64 --> 2286.0899999999997
particle and that is where it gets

2282.76 --> 2289.84
really complex but that's only second or

2286.09 --> 2292.4700000000003
it's mechanical secondary but also yet

2289.84 --> 2295.1800000000003
the particle presupposition feeds weird

2292.47 --> 2297.4599999999996
mathematical conceptualizations like a

2295.18 --> 2300.91
particle being at two points at the same

2297.46 --> 2303.25
time which is so purely ethereal that it

2300.91 --> 2307.47
should be a red flag to anyone like that

2303.25 --> 2310.85
is physically impossible you can't if

2307.47 --> 2314.8399999999997
the model shows that that could be

2310.85 --> 2316.0699999999997
then it must be wrong that is reasoning

2314.84 --> 2320.15
because it's a physical impossibility

2316.07 --> 2323.2400000000002
for two things to be at two locations at

2320.15 --> 2327.53
the same time then it's notice then it's

2323.24 --> 2329.6
not a particle well you know that is

2327.53 --> 2332.3300000000004
part of the mystery of quantum physics

2329.6 --> 2335.9
are the apparent paradoxes that arise

2332.33 --> 2338.66
you know wave particle duality one

2335.9 --> 2343.51
particle being in all places at the same

2338.66 --> 2347.39
time everywhere in the alleged universe

2343.51 --> 2349.67
but you know I feel like because there's

2347.39 --> 2352.22
there's two ways intercom mechanics from

2349.67 --> 2354.44
what I understand there's the idealist

2352.22 --> 2356.8999999999996
approach and then there's the realist

2354.44 --> 2360.11
approach realism says we live in a

2356.9 --> 2362.57
purely mechanistic reality everything

2360.11 --> 2366.77
exists objectively in the objective

2362.57 --> 2368.51
world and that's basically that's your

2366.77 --> 2369.95
average mainstream sort of atheist

2368.51 --> 2372.32
physicalist that's how they view the

2369.95 --> 2373.7
world realism and then there's basically

2372.32 --> 2376.94
the complete opposite of that which is

2373.7 --> 2380.24
idealism and idealism is the idea that

2376.94 --> 2383.68
reality is dependent on subjectivity

2380.24 --> 2387.35
that the world doesn't exist objectively

2383.68 --> 2389.0899999999997
separate from consciousness it all

2387.35 --> 2393.68
hinges actually on our subjective

2389.09 --> 2396.32
experience and I always thought that all

2393.68 --> 2399.0499999999997
the at least the ones I've thought about

2396.32 --> 2400.73
the the the the apparent contradictions

2399.05 --> 2403.0600000000004
in quantum physics like wave particle

2400.73 --> 2405.23
duality people wait and when a particle

2403.06 --> 2409.49
always felt like a lot of these

2405.23 --> 2411.26
contradictions were resolved if you just

2409.49 --> 2413.66
took a different interpretation if you

2411.26 --> 2416.6000000000004
took the idealist interpretation if you

2413.66 --> 2419.69
took the interpretation that a knower is

2416.6 --> 2423.29
required for physical reality to even

2419.69 --> 2425.12
exist in the first place like this as an

2423.29 --> 2428.47
example I would say like okay wait a

2425.12 --> 2431.5099999999998
particle duality it's pretty weird

2428.47 --> 2434.7799999999997
is it a wave or is it a particle but

2431.51 --> 2437.75
well what is really sorry yeah now yeah

2434.78 --> 2441.26
let's get on to that after this but what

2437.75 --> 2444.21
is even knowing is knowing something

2441.26 --> 2448.17
that somebody has to recognize conscious

2444.21 --> 2450.9
or is it any kind of observation or is

2448.17 --> 2454.7400000000002
it just being in the presence of your

2450.9 --> 2457.4300000000003
energy field you know what is it that's

2454.74 --> 2460.47
a great one that's a great question

2457.43 --> 2461.52
anybody knows right now come your

2460.47 --> 2463.5589999999997
subconscious

2461.52 --> 2465.54
could potentially pick up things before

2463.559 --> 2467.9700000000003
you consciously even realize it and

2465.54 --> 2471.63
that's something that I've been learning

2467.97 --> 2475.7
about so how does that really work

2471.63 --> 2477.96
where is the knowledge really coming in

2475.7 --> 2479.9399999999996
that's a really good point because I've

2477.96 --> 2483.2400000000002
thought about that too it's like do you

2479.94 --> 2486.089
just have to see the experimental result

2483.24 --> 2488.8489999999997
with your eyeball and and and and and

2486.089 --> 2491.25
that's that's what counts or what if

2488.849 --> 2495.059
somebody whispers in your ear the result

2491.25 --> 2497.069
of the experiment is just hearing

2495.059 --> 2499.3190000000004
because you know there's different types

2497.069 --> 2501.359
of senses there's their consciousness is

2499.319 --> 2503.79
filtered through different senses sight

2501.359 --> 2504.3289999999997
sound taste oh I said I got one I got

2503.79 --> 2506.49
one

2504.329 --> 2510.02
oh this is a trick this is a trick one

2506.49 --> 2513.8999999999996
the trick set up it so say there's two

2510.02 --> 2515.819
scientists at the machine that does that

2513.9 --> 2521.76
thing and they know if they actually

2515.819 --> 2525.24
take a look at however the interaction

2521.76 --> 2527.059
works it could change so one guy that

2525.24 --> 2530.819
definitely doesn't take a look the other

2527.059 --> 2533.19
may take a look but he doesn't tell so

2530.819 --> 2537.39
then he gives a result to the other

2533.19 --> 2541.14
person which could be false basically

2537.39 --> 2545.99
what the other person's interpretation

2541.14 --> 2548.22
of that actually influenced it you know

2545.99 --> 2550.47
and you know you know what I wonder I

2548.22 --> 2552.24
wonder if we said yes thinking about it

2550.47 --> 2556.859
even if you don't actually know it

2552.24 --> 2560.72
already gonna influence it exactly yeah

2556.859 --> 2563.73
no and I've heard a few kind of similar

2560.72 --> 2566.4599999999996
scenarios like one scenario this guy

2563.73 --> 2568.26
named Tom Campbell he's one of the dudes

2566.46 --> 2570.89
who helped get me into simulation theory

2568.26 --> 2573.329
back in 2012 Tom Campbell

2570.89 --> 2575.0989999999997
you know he's into like astral

2573.329 --> 2578.1600000000003
projection he claims that he can leave

2575.099 --> 2579.78
his body he's trained himself for like

2578.16 --> 2582.12
40 years or something so he can leave

2579.78 --> 2585.59
his body at will after all projection

2582.12 --> 2587.52
and he says he basically says if I'm not

2585.59 --> 2589.8900000000003
misrepresenting him but this is my

2587.52 --> 2594.5099999999998
understanding it's like whole simulation

2589.89 --> 2596.85
theory things like astral projection you

2594.51 --> 2599.9100000000003
know what astral projection is right are

2596.85 --> 2601.5299999999997
there several angles to it yes do you

2599.91 --> 2603.2999999999997
understand the concept that you can your

2601.53 --> 2607.6800000000003
consciousness can leave your body

2603.3 --> 2610.6800000000003
basically sort of it in different levels

2607.68 --> 2613.47
it can and in different directions you

2610.68 --> 2615.8999999999996
can basically have a yeah a outer

2613.47 --> 2619.41
projection with a core tied into it and

2615.9 --> 2622.05
then it's mostly only a sensory that

2619.41 --> 2625.92
goes out there but you can also be

2622.05 --> 2628.26
dislodge and even have said the sensory

2625.92 --> 2629.91
of your physical presence which can

2628.26 --> 2632.61
happen for example with the near-death

2629.91 --> 2635.52
experience where you actually manifest

2632.61 --> 2637.17
physically or well energy-wise in your

2635.52 --> 2639.21
perception in the real world and then

2637.17 --> 2641.52
there is more extreme experiences

2639.21 --> 2644.76
relating to heavy psychotropics where

2641.52 --> 2647.28
you basically yeah your spirit dislodges

2644.76 --> 2648.9300000000003
into another physical in an other sub

2647.28 --> 2649.59
dimension as it were it's totally

2648.93 --> 2654.72
unrelated

2649.59 --> 2657.84
so right there are several ways but do

2654.72 --> 2659.73
you do you believe that like the

2657.84 --> 2660.96
person's spirit or soul or consciousness

2659.73 --> 2662.37
whatever you want to call it you have

2660.96 --> 2663.7200000000003
what do you think you think it's

2662.37 --> 2668.81
actually leaving the body you think it's

2663.72 --> 2674.16
just some kind of hallucination because

2668.81 --> 2677.58
actually I think that a lot of what

2674.16 --> 2679.3799999999997
actually transpired with the

2677.58 --> 2682.98
consciousness and even with the sensory

2679.38 --> 2686.61
I think that these physical things are

2682.98 --> 2692.25
more like the the backup for the spirit

2686.61 --> 2694.35
it's like the the registry for it like a

2692.25 --> 2696.9
backup registry for if the spirit

2694.35 --> 2699.5899999999997
becomes diffused or lost but I think

2696.9 --> 2702.9
that it is the spirit actually doing it

2699.59 --> 2705.63
riding upon the system of your body and

2702.9 --> 2707.9700000000003
I think that it can basically take on

2705.63 --> 2710.25
that format and then project it outside

2707.97 --> 2711.72
so that you can literally have extra

2710.25 --> 2714.81
baldly perception

2711.72 --> 2719.5789999999997
I think that is possible I think the the

2714.81 --> 2723.0
a person is more spirit then then most

2719.579 --> 2725.7000000000003
people like to believe and I think a lot

2723.0 --> 2730.05
of sensory is directly attributed to the

2725.7 --> 2732.6899999999996
spirit and basically has a secondary arm

2730.05 --> 2736.77
or manifestation within the physical

2732.69 --> 2743.67
body as well right that's how I've

2736.77 --> 2750.69
conceptualized it let me ask you a

2743.67 --> 2752.73
question so so you think father's even

2750.69 --> 2755.73
matters at the end of the day like okay

2752.73 --> 2757.829
so it's flat but now what like okay so

2755.73 --> 2760.109
it's flat but you still gotta eat you

2757.829 --> 2761.67
still got a [ __ ] you know sustain

2760.109 --> 2765.69
your body you're still bound by the

2761.67 --> 2767.04
physical laws umm do you think it makes

2765.69 --> 2768.599
a difference whether it's flat or not

2767.04 --> 2770.25
you think okay let's say we prove it and

2768.599 --> 2773.7000000000003
it's come hundred-percent conclusive

2770.25 --> 2776.25
proof it's flat and all the signs

2773.7 --> 2778.5
suddenly agrees and all the universities

2776.25 --> 2780.54
not teach that it's flat I mean do you

2778.5 --> 2782.73
really think it'll make a difference in

2780.54 --> 2785.089
terms of how we live our lives how

2782.73 --> 2787.26
societies or structures or not there's a

2785.089 --> 2789.15
scumbags running the world do you really

2787.26 --> 2793.2200000000003
think anything will change Lee huge

2789.15 --> 2796.05
amounts it will totally block corruption

2793.22 --> 2799.2
because all of that corruption is based

2796.05 --> 2801.0600000000004
on a giant framework of basically

2799.2 --> 2803.2799999999997
falsehoods lie upon lie upon lie

2801.06 --> 2805.56
everything and that is one of the things

2803.28 --> 2808.2000000000003
that flat earth really reveals is how

2805.56 --> 2810.869
far the controllers have gone in order

2808.2 --> 2816.0299999999997
to mind-control everyone how far they

2810.869 --> 2820.26
are willing to go I agree actually

2816.03 --> 2823.92
because if like you said if if they lie

2820.26 --> 2825.75
about the dirt we stick and on then we

2823.92 --> 2827.67
can't trust anything they say so you're

2825.75 --> 2830.64
right it would be flat earth I think

2827.67 --> 2832.41
would collapse the Empire lies yeah

2830.64 --> 2834.45
totally yeah but not without some

2832.41 --> 2836.91
serious ruckus and that's a problem

2834.45 --> 2839.339
that's the biggest problem they'd really

2836.91 --> 2842.7599999999998
have to willingly transit and basically

2839.339 --> 2844.589
do a mercy flee and still cover up their

2842.76 --> 2845.13
more vile crimes which they of course

2844.589 --> 2848.07
yeah

2845.13 --> 2849.6600000000003
or if yeah if it's like if everything

2848.07 --> 2852.06
goes all the way then is just gonna be

2849.66 --> 2854.49
damaged everywhere because the real evil

2852.06 --> 2857.31
ones have all their basically their self

2854.49 --> 2858.1699999999996
destruct policies and that's a big

2857.31 --> 2861.27
problem

2858.17 --> 2865.32
so Flat Earth is one element in it but

2861.27 --> 2870.29
it is the one thing that shows how far

2865.32 --> 2870.29
the mind control has been allowed to go

2870.68 --> 2878.79
it's crazy bro it's it's crazy how like

2875.82 --> 2880.17
that's the thing like I'm 95 percent

2878.79 --> 2881.37
flattered it's like I'm not even a

2880.17 --> 2882.9
hundred percent there yet like I don't

2881.37 --> 2883.8599999999997
know what you call it like I don't know

2882.9 --> 2886.02
if you consider yourself to be

2883.86 --> 2888.51
full-blown flat or if there's no way

2886.02 --> 2890.34
than when I glow but I'm customizing 95

2888.51 --> 2892.2900000000004
percent there with a five percent chance

2890.34 --> 2894.03
we might still live on a globe because

2892.29 --> 2895.77
I'm still looking into it and I'm still

2894.03 --> 2898.4100000000003
trying to work out all the little

2895.77 --> 2902.91
nuances mm-hmm I totally get it

2898.41 --> 2906.3599999999997
ya know I call my tend to put myself in

2902.91 --> 2909.81
the Flat Earth category like just to

2906.36 --> 2911.82
prevent being special and you yeah I

2909.81 --> 2914.13
don't want to be like a slick James or

2911.82 --> 2918.48
anything you'd have probably done it oh

2914.13 --> 2920.58
yeah you probably do yeah so but I bet

2918.48 --> 2923.52
I'm basically a Cosmo genus because I

2920.58 --> 2925.41
can presuppose a lot of things and I

2923.52 --> 2927.06
hope you took notice that I literally

2925.41 --> 2930.39
can branch out any direction I can

2927.06 --> 2932.94
defend any model but I will always be

2930.39 --> 2935.8199999999997
honest about the problems with it so I

2932.94 --> 2939.08
can basically be a real global but an

2935.82 --> 2942.48
honest one that doesn't claim reality

2939.08 --> 2944.2799999999997
basically about it and that's also what

2942.48 --> 2946.92
I've been trying to do just to clear up

2944.28 --> 2950.03
things because so many growers are so

2946.92 --> 2953.25
preoccupied with their fanaticism of

2950.03 --> 2955.44
defending it that they lose oversight

2953.25 --> 2960.0
over the what it actually is they're

2955.44 --> 2965.39
defending yeah lovers are a psychotic

2960.0 --> 2965.39
cult maniacs am i you're just crazy like

2965.45 --> 2974.0699999999997
they're just they're just so they're so

2969.89 --> 2977.49
they're so they're just religious like

2974.07 --> 2978.4500000000003
you know like no yes they are

2977.49 --> 2979.8289999999997
technically

2978.45 --> 2981.81
religious but you can't even call that

2979.829 --> 2985.17
religious because any religion has

2981.81 --> 2988.94
definite balances about it their every

2985.17 --> 2991.71
rage in like the church or whatever is

2988.94 --> 2994.9500000000003
basically to find peace with always

2991.71 --> 2997.02
don't do that they're just freaking and

2994.95 --> 3003.109
if they don't have flatter than they

2997.02 --> 3009.32
each other so it's just a group of

3003.109 --> 3011.2999999999997
neurotic people religious because I

3009.32 --> 3013.6090000000004
usually kind of sarcastically that's

3011.3 --> 3015.2000000000003
what a lot of theists glowers like to

3013.609 --> 3017.63
call flat earthers I'd like to call us

3015.2 --> 3019.0989999999997
we're just nut jobs but hey if it turns

3017.63 --> 3022.9900000000002
out there's no proof for the Hispanics

3019.099 --> 3025.67
baseball then you guys are the so-called

3022.99 --> 3028.8199999999997
religious delusional people but

3025.67 --> 3032.1800000000003
obviously and that's the thing like if

3028.82 --> 3036.589
your cosmology or your view of the world

3032.18 --> 3038.0299999999997
it's actually empirically true then I

3036.589 --> 3039.56
would say by definition it's not

3038.03 --> 3042.4700000000003
religious but I guess it depends on what

3039.56 --> 3044.24
you define as religion well nowadays in

3042.47 --> 3047.359
our search for the world the religion is

3044.24 --> 3050.569
generally defined as you know falsehood

3047.359 --> 3052.97
belief fantasy things that you can't

3050.569 --> 3055.88
prove hey that's the technical atheist

3052.97 --> 3058.64
approach to it yeah exactly right but

3055.88 --> 3062.089
there are some real religious glowers

3058.64 --> 3064.8489999999997
like for example don and will you really

3062.089 --> 3067.4
become really religious in the modern

3064.849 --> 3069.17
sense when you realize it is basically a

3067.4 --> 3072.38
belief and you just say okay I'm gonna

3069.17 --> 3074.63
go with my belief and Don is like that

3072.38 --> 3076.4300000000003
and that's different with a lot of other

3074.63 --> 3079.9300000000003
clubs that say no it's not a belief it's

3076.43 --> 3082.97
true it's they are true believers and

3079.93 --> 3084.44
it's like a difference it's mechanical

3082.97 --> 3086.839
difference you're a believer in which

3084.44 --> 3089.21
you go with a belief and Trust in that

3086.839 --> 3092.81
or you're a true believer and then you

3089.21 --> 3095.0
absolutely persist that it is reality no

3092.81 --> 3097.49
matter what and that goes into

3095.0 --> 3099.71
fanaticism and insanity basically that's

3097.49 --> 3103.339
a true believer and those are fanatics

3099.71 --> 3106.46
so Nathan Oakley is not exaggerating

3103.339 --> 3110.3289999999997
when he comes calls them fanatics there

3106.46 --> 3111.95
are fun days all right yeah their

3110.329 --> 3118.3900000000003
reasoning method is from the

3111.95 --> 3121.7
listen their character traits is fanatic

3118.39 --> 3123.47
because a fanatic to the general sense

3121.7 --> 3127.0099999999998
about a fanatic is that they know no

3123.47 --> 3141.52
shame in their focus they'll go anywhere

3127.01 --> 3141.5200000000004
to just win still there

3143.35 --> 3147.49
hmm I think he may be on a call or

3145.75 --> 3150.43
something anyway yeah awesome

3147.49 --> 3157.33
conversation I love this I hope you guys

3150.43 --> 3161.02
are enjoying it as well man I really

3157.33 --> 3165.06
hope that red pill can come on my show

3161.02 --> 3165.06
more often I love this conversation

3174.29 --> 3179.72
now Zep tepi we're not general

3177.92 --> 3181.55
overgeneralizing all ballers i

3179.72 --> 3184.1299999999997
specifically even point out the

3181.55 --> 3192.1400000000003
different types there are different

3184.13 --> 3196.4300000000003
categories oh it's gonna you back hey

3192.14 --> 3199.0699999999997
can you yeah well yeah my wise [ __ ]

3196.43 --> 3205.16
sometimes yeah alright okay

3199.07 --> 3210.8
looking back what were we talking about

3205.16 --> 3214.3399999999997
i think religious yeah can you hear me

3210.8 --> 3215.9900000000002
yeah yeah can okay just yeah I think my

3214.34 --> 3218.36
wife I sort of glitching out but

3215.99 --> 3236.3599999999997
actually let me just turn the Wi-Fi off

3218.36 --> 3239.9300000000003
hang on one second hey I'm back in here

3236.36 --> 3241.94
yes all right my but I want to ask you

3239.93 --> 3244.31
um because this is this is a question I

3241.94 --> 3249.65
wanted to pass through some flat

3244.31 --> 3252.7999999999997
earthers and that is is there a better

3249.65 --> 3256.7200000000003
word to describe ourselves other than

3252.8 --> 3259.21
flat earthers the earth isn't

3256.72 --> 3261.6499999999996
technically flat I mean there's

3259.21 --> 3266.81
undulation x' there's mountains there's

3261.65 --> 3268.46
valleys right wine it's right why why

3266.81 --> 3270.5299999999997
call ourselves well because they're

3268.46 --> 3272.39
because of your life well if you're

3270.53 --> 3276.32
gonna say it technically correct there's

3272.39 --> 3278.06
gonna be some problems no why because I

3276.32 --> 3280.34
think there's a giant apparatus out

3278.06 --> 3283.12
there that wouldn't really appreciate it

3280.34 --> 3287.03
if we started to call it straight earth

3283.12 --> 3289.7
if you know what I mean it but it's

3287.03 --> 3292.7000000000003
straight even is that even accurate

3289.7 --> 3294.9199999999996
because what what is the definition of

3292.7 --> 3298.91
straight I mean is straight basically a

3294.92 --> 3302.42
synonym for flat I mean flat can

3298.91 --> 3305.45
emphasize the surface structure more you

3302.42 --> 3307.79
know is it flat or is it bumpy but

3305.45 --> 3310.73
straight or is it curved

3307.79 --> 3314.0299999999997
that's very that narrows it down much

3310.73 --> 3314.57
more geometrically but it's not gonna

3314.03 --> 3318.6200000000003
work

3314.57 --> 3322.76
and besides flat it does have more

3318.62 --> 3324.44
impact I don't know that's what they

3322.76 --> 3327.2900000000004
that's what they say opposed it they

3324.44 --> 3330.98
don't call it straight earth in the in

3327.29 --> 3332.48
the schools when they ridicule it here's

3330.98 --> 3336.02
the problem you know what I think here's

3332.48 --> 3339.1
my theory my theory is that just one

3336.02 --> 3344.05
week calling ourselves flat earthers I

3339.1 --> 3348.3199999999997
feel like Flat Earth is a term made in

3344.05 --> 3351.0800000000004
reaction to the curving globe model I

3348.32 --> 3353.06
feel like when you are born and raised

3351.08 --> 3355.0699999999997
to believe you live on a sphere when all

3353.06 --> 3356.66
the institutions all the educational

3355.07 --> 3358.61
systems are telling you live on a sphere

3356.66 --> 3360.35
when it's all you see everywhere when

3358.61 --> 3362.8700000000003
it's what the majority of people believe

3360.35 --> 3365.8399999999997
that we live on a sphere and you're the

3362.87 --> 3367.7
one guy who's saying no we don't live on

3365.84 --> 3371.32
a sphere there's no curvature anywhere

3367.7 --> 3375.08
that [ __ ] is flat I think that's a

3371.32 --> 3378.44
reacting it Flat Earth is a reactionary

3375.08 --> 3380.7799999999997
term to the global model right so part

3378.44 --> 3385.4
of me feels like calling it Flat Earth

3380.78 --> 3388.94
is still in a way stuck inside the globe

3385.4 --> 3392.06
paradigm we are reactive to the

3388.94 --> 3394.19
existence of the globe model because

3392.06 --> 3396.86
again flat is not really accurate

3394.19 --> 3399.68
because even on the Flat Earth the earth

3396.86 --> 3401.51
isn't flat there's undulations mountains

3399.68 --> 3404.99
valleys so it's not even an accurate

3401.51 --> 3408.26
term like I understand that the next

3404.99 --> 3412.3399999999997
shape the average shape over the entire

3408.26 --> 3413.7200000000003
span it is basically flat I'm starting

3412.34 --> 3420.26
to wonder if there's a better word we

3413.72 --> 3422.47
can come up with well I'll think about

3420.26 --> 3422.4700000000003
it

3425.2 --> 3434.96
anything else that sounds like naming a

3432.2 --> 3437.6
concept by the way but here's a problem

3434.96 --> 3438.35
with low Earth is that these bastards

3437.6 --> 3440.15
hijack

3438.35 --> 3443.72
the word level to mean perpendicular to

3440.15 --> 3445.64
the center of the sphere so technically

3443.72 --> 3448.43
the sphere can be perpendicular to the

3445.64 --> 3450.5299999999997
sphere that would make any sense it's

3448.43 --> 3454.43
only in an object relating to the

3450.53 --> 3458.48
presupposed sphere mm-hmm but that you

3454.43 --> 3460.43
can presuppose it to itself right so

3458.48 --> 3463.69
maybe that's worth I don't know it is

3460.43 --> 3466.8199999999997
actually kind of like gamer angle grippy

3463.69 --> 3469.61
even plays into assimilationists that

3466.82 --> 3472.73
may prefer that word so why not love

3469.61 --> 3477.77
world earth welcome to level earth

3472.73 --> 3481.1
people yeah and it's one giant long-ass

3477.77 --> 3486.74
level that never ends maybe we don't

3481.1 --> 3488.7799999999997
know we don't know so so so um so I was

3486.74 --> 3491.7799999999997
trying to think of here's what's funny

3488.78 --> 3495.2000000000003
is though there's a video on my channel

3491.78 --> 3497.6600000000003
I was sitting down at a park doing a

3495.2 --> 3499.25
livestream me on my cell phone and some

3497.66 --> 3500.8399999999997
guy was walking by and he heard me

3499.25 --> 3503.15
talking about Flat Earth so he stopped

3500.84 --> 3504.86
in his tracks and he started asking me

3503.15 --> 3505.9700000000003
what are you talking about what the hell

3504.86 --> 3507.8900000000003
are you talking well he was interested

3505.97 --> 3509.7799999999997
so I tried to tell him about Flat Earth

3507.89 --> 3512.2999999999997
and he said but what about the pictures

3509.78 --> 3514.0400000000004
from space and I'm like well you know

3512.3 --> 3515.54
that's you know whatever you can't prove

3514.04 --> 3520.16
that you know who knows that's all

3515.54 --> 3522.47
government control and then he's like

3520.16 --> 3523.8199999999997
look the earth obviously isn't flat you

3522.47 --> 3527.3599999999997
know there's mountains and there's

3523.82 --> 3530.54
valleys and hills and I'm like well you

3527.36 --> 3533.33
know obviously by flat what we mean is

3530.54 --> 3539.0299999999997
we're definitely not stuck to the

3533.33 --> 3540.41
underside of a sphere and that I've had

3539.03 --> 3542.57
those interactions many times with

3540.41 --> 3544.5499999999997
people well the kind of mach calling it

3542.57 --> 3546.23
Flat Earth and they'll kind of like like

3544.55 --> 3548.3900000000003
it's like they think it's ridiculous and

3546.23 --> 3549.23
in a way it kind of is ridiculous to

3548.39 --> 3553.79
call it Flat Earth

3549.23 --> 3555.71
it's not flat it's flat compared to the

3553.79 --> 3557.69
sphere which again that's why I feel

3555.71 --> 3559.28
like Flat Earth is a reactionary term

3557.69 --> 3559.64
and I feel like we're still stuck in the

3559.28 --> 3564.1400000000003
globe

3559.64 --> 3569.5899999999997
paradigm if we call it flat but my point

3564.14 --> 3573.5499999999997
is this is my I might have lost my okay

3569.59 --> 3575.32
I remember so the point is this I feel

3573.55 --> 3579.1000000000004
like one of the most defining features

3575.32 --> 3581.5
or one of the most distinguishing things

3579.1 --> 3586.63
between flat earth and the sphere earth

3581.5 --> 3591.91
is that down doesn't change directions

3586.63 --> 3595.48
on the sphere earth down to the earth

3591.91 --> 3598.18
that that direction is changing the

3595.48 --> 3600.04
direction it's pointing to as you know

3598.18 --> 3603.04
from you know Sony in North America

3600.04 --> 3605.92
versus somebody in Australia to the

3603.04 --> 3607.87
centre of Earth those are those are two

3605.92 --> 3617.2000000000003
different directions now everything

3607.87 --> 3618.88
becomes regio relative like yeah yes

3617.2 --> 3621.1299999999997
they have to pull a relativity card out

3618.88 --> 3622.42
so that you know I've had this many

3621.13 --> 3624.6400000000003
times that when I debate a godless

3622.42 --> 3626.11
engineer the same thing happened he's

3624.64 --> 3628.6299999999997
like oh it's all relative so they're

3626.11 --> 3630.9100000000003
social figures direction is this like a

3628.63 --> 3633.04
call it direction call it orientation I

3630.91 --> 3635.23
don't give a crap what you call it the

3633.04 --> 3638.14
direction that things fall to the earth

3635.23 --> 3639.07
change direction on a sphere period

3638.14 --> 3642.0699999999997
there they're going in different

3639.07 --> 3644.11
directions and you know a lot of times

3642.07 --> 3647.11
the global all concede oh but if you

3644.11 --> 3649.54
okay we they'll be like okay your point

3647.11 --> 3652.09
does make sense if you're from a

3649.54 --> 3655.15
reference frame outside of Earth so if

3652.09 --> 3657.3700000000003
you're like on the moon then yes down

3655.15 --> 3659.8
for someone in North America and down

3657.37 --> 3661.33
for somebody in Australia would be two

3659.8 --> 3663.82
different directions so they try to pull

3661.33 --> 3665.3199999999997
out relativity to off you skate and make

3663.82 --> 3666.25
it all weird but we all know what's

3665.32 --> 3669.9100000000003
going on these are two different

3666.25 --> 3673.27
directions on a flat earth down is one

3669.91 --> 3676.06
direction it's uniform yep yeah it

3673.27 --> 3677.86
doesn't change so our thinking about

3676.06 --> 3680.35
that I'm like well maybe that's the

3677.86 --> 3683.02
defining feature of flat earth not flat

3680.35 --> 3684.61
because flat you know it's not flat

3683.02 --> 3686.41
there are undulation smiles valleys

3684.61 --> 3688.36
hills I'm like well maybe the true

3686.41 --> 3691.5699999999997
defining feature flutter is that down

3688.36 --> 3694.63
doesn't change direction so then I was

3691.57 --> 3697.51
trying to find a nice sounding phrase or

3694.63 --> 3700.3
term that hold on can I break in from

3697.51 --> 3702.9700000000003
yeah thank you James Mays by way for the

3700.3 --> 3705.4
twenty dollar super Chad donation

3702.97 --> 3707.0499999999997
share the show smashed the super chat

3705.4 --> 3708.73
great Arwen thank you

3707.05 --> 3712.48
yeah share to show indeed sorry

3708.73 --> 3714.609
continues yeah my heart was basically

3712.48 --> 3715.69
I'm trying to come up with a word that

3714.609 --> 3720.43
sounds good

3715.69 --> 3722.56
that simply describes down not changing

3720.43 --> 3725.2599999999998
direction down is only one direction so

3722.56 --> 3727.27
I try to think of words like okay well

3725.26 --> 3730.51
what's another word for one so what may

3727.27 --> 3734.77
be mono or uni how about you in a

3730.51 --> 3737.7400000000002
directional earth you need or you need

3734.77 --> 3740.53
down but they all sounded so bad that I

3737.74 --> 3742.7799999999997
use this every single one I can come up

3740.53 --> 3743.98
with sounds horrific so I'm not I guess

3742.78 --> 3745.8100000000004
I'll have to keep thinking about it

3743.98 --> 3747.79
maybe somebody in the track and think of

3745.81 --> 3750.31
something but I think we need a better

3747.79 --> 3755.04
word because I my view is that flat

3750.31 --> 3758.19
earth that phrase is still in a way

3755.04 --> 3761.38
trapped inside the global model we are

3758.19 --> 3763.03
reacting to the to the curving sphere

3761.38 --> 3765.849
below model that's my view me with

3763.03 --> 3768.8190000000004
mmm-hmm maybe look there the entire

3765.849 --> 3772.03
reasoning structures has all been geo

3768.819 --> 3774.67
centralized in even the build-up of it

3772.03 --> 3776.92
so it's very hard to escape it and any

3774.67 --> 3778.569
Outsiders well oh that are not used to

3776.92 --> 3782.349
it will always basically approach it

3778.569 --> 3784.39
through geocentric or thinking but I

3782.349 --> 3787.1800000000003
don't know I like I kind of like the

3784.39 --> 3789.5499999999997
sound of unidirectional earth it does

3787.18 --> 3793.93
sound very uniform and you can even

3789.55 --> 3798.2200000000003
interpret it as well you can interpret

3793.93 --> 3803.73
it socially as well too many syllables

3798.22 --> 3806.56
all right too many syllable

3803.73 --> 3809.05
uni-directional note it's either lower

3806.56 --> 3814.66
or flatter or you can call this just

3809.05 --> 3823.54
down to earth down that's great that's

3814.66 --> 3824.74
great oh man but yet but I think for

3823.54 --> 3830.49
those we're gonna have to settle for

3824.74 --> 3830.49
Flat Earth because that is everyone says

3830.579 --> 3835.9500000000003
yeah

3832.5 --> 3844.53
I'm gonna commit myself to finding the

3835.95 --> 3846.7799999999997
right name a perfect name yeah yeah can

3844.53 --> 3849.1800000000003
we what were we talking about before

3846.78 --> 3856.53
that before we got distracted about what

3849.18 --> 3859.02
we should call Flat Earth talking about

3856.53 --> 3865.8900000000003
[ __ ] how to follow the lead so we

3859.02 --> 3870.03
thought about everything right yeah

3865.89 --> 3871.17
quantum mechanics no I think we've

3870.03 --> 3874.1090000000004
pretty nice pretty much said everything

3871.17 --> 3876.7200000000003
about it it's just there's a lot of Dept

3874.109 --> 3880.77
particle thinking concerning quantum

3876.72 --> 3883.95
physics is very mechanical based on

3880.77 --> 3886.74
particle theory and I have sincere doubt

3883.95 --> 3888.5989999999997
about the particle nature that is

3886.74 --> 3890.79
assumed about light and electricity

3888.599 --> 3896.3300000000004
because I don't think they are particles

3890.79 --> 3901.589
I think light is is an infinitely

3896.33 --> 3904.17
divisible beam connection instantaneous

3901.589 --> 3906.33
beam connection of energy that can split

3904.17 --> 3910.53
up indefinitely basically and I think

3906.33 --> 3912.39
that electricity is rather an arc of

3910.53 --> 3917.0400000000004
energy because electricity really

3912.39 --> 3919.65
doesn't travel it just connects or it

3917.04 --> 3922.349
does not connect and then it digresses

3919.65 --> 3924.9300000000003
it stops so everything about it seems

3922.349 --> 3926.94
almost entirely instantaneous and one

3924.93 --> 3929.73
could reason with lightning strikes yes

3926.94 --> 3932.2200000000003
there is like an interval a bit but I

3929.73 --> 3935.609
think that might actually be rather the

3932.22 --> 3937.98
response of the molecules basically

3935.609 --> 3941.8199999999997
being disintegrated from the high

3937.98 --> 3943.65
voltage that are actually slow slowing

3941.82 --> 3945.48
down in the process like a reaction a

3943.65 --> 3947.9700000000003
chemical reaction rather than the

3945.48 --> 3950.88
electricity itself that precedes that

3947.97 --> 3953.52
and is probably instantaneous that's my

3950.88 --> 3955.859
reasoning about lightning and well the

3953.52 --> 3962.13
light part it's pretty straightforward

3955.859 --> 3963.15
because I'm gonna my car real quick so

3962.13 --> 3964.23
I'll be making a bunch of noise I'm

3963.15 --> 3966.0
gonna meet myself in just a couple

3964.23 --> 3968.15
minutes all right all right

3966.0 --> 3971.34
and I wanted a response on that but I

3968.15 --> 3972.69
will I gotta go to my car cuz I gotta go

3971.34 --> 3973.71
somewhere but I'll keep talking to in

3972.69 --> 3977.4
the car just give me a second all right

3973.71 --> 3979.88
all right no problem I'm gonna do myself

3977.4 --> 3979.88
all right

3981.17 --> 3990.03
but right I have still back to the light

3987.36 --> 3994.32
not problem no I'm not presuming light

3990.03 --> 3998.55
to be particles concept I'm still short

3994.32 --> 4001.4900000000002
of any serious direct evidence that

3998.55 --> 4005.5600000000004
proves to me that light is actually an

4001.49 --> 4008.54
indivisible unit that cannot be split up

4005.56 --> 4014.2599999999998
just like molecules can't without

4008.54 --> 4014.2599999999998
actually turning into something else and

4014.38 --> 4019.61
right because from what I've calculated

4017.48 --> 4021.38
so far from what I've gathered about

4019.61 --> 4024.08
light how they came to the

4021.38 --> 4031.34
conceptualization of a light particle

4024.08 --> 4034.31
was by the minimum interaction the

4031.34 --> 4037.82
minimum energy quanta requirement in

4034.31 --> 4040.46
order for light to be registered in

4037.82 --> 4044.1800000000003
material so they basically toned it down

4040.46 --> 4048.32
the energy quanta until it was no longer

4044.18 --> 4050.72
registerable and then the first glimpse

4048.32 --> 4052.67
of register ability that's how they

4050.72 --> 4055.79
sizeof okay because of this we deduced

4052.67 --> 4057.98
the amount of energy that must be a

4055.79 --> 4061.7
light particle energy quanta because

4057.98 --> 4063.8
below that it's not registered but I

4061.7 --> 4068.6
think that that is basically based on

4063.8 --> 4071.32
the presupposition thanks to the

4068.6 --> 4074.0299999999997
material nature because matter is

4071.32 --> 4075.8900000000003
indivisible has an indivisible size so

4074.03 --> 4078.02
any interaction with matter which we

4075.89 --> 4083.24
require to even prove that light is a

4078.02 --> 4085.88
thing will always be limited to the

4083.24 --> 4091.22
minimum energy quanta that makes it

4085.88 --> 4093.9500000000003
switch and respond so I think that big

4091.22 --> 4096.679999999999
there are other things experiments or

4093.95 --> 4100.009
tests you could do to show that that's

4096.68 --> 4102.799
not really the case at all cuz light

4100.009 --> 4108.65
very tiny amount of light can basically

4102.799 --> 4111.08
split up in a prison and have different

4108.65 --> 4114.23
type yeah the light frequency is

4111.08 --> 4118.0599999999995
transformed but it also spreads out that

4114.23 --> 4121.219999999999
kind of element yeah it just shows that

4118.06 --> 4124.46
if literally light can split up by a

4121.22 --> 4126.9800000000005
medium itself so persistently then how

4124.46 --> 4129.5
can those be particles that doesn't make

4126.98 --> 4131.929999999999
any sense to me it's much more likely

4129.5 --> 4135.71
that is literally a uniform beam that is

4131.93 --> 4137.9890000000005
just perfectly dividing up it's

4135.71 --> 4142.66
perfectly split up in a very persistent

4137.989 --> 4146.599999999999
pattern but that's how I see it Riley

4142.66 --> 4148.2789999999995
I'm back in here yes I can hear you okay

4146.6 --> 4150.35
I'm driving so there might be some

4148.279 --> 4151.910000000001
background noise so if that ever becomes

4150.35 --> 4153.5
too loud just let me know and maybe

4151.91 --> 4155.45
we'll talk another time because I'm

4153.5 --> 4156.71
gonna be driving so if it's too loud all

4155.45 --> 4158.66
right no it's it's fine

4156.71 --> 4166.31
there's a little bit of noise but it's

4158.66 --> 4168.43
not disruptive so come on responder what

4166.31 --> 4170.870000000001
you're saying early yes sure

4168.43 --> 4172.819
unfortunately how do you repeat it

4170.87 --> 4175.25
because I don't remember exactly what

4172.819 --> 4176.6
you said honestly and it seems I might

4175.25 --> 4178.22
not even have a response because it I

4176.6 --> 4181.88
didn't really understand a lot of it to

4178.22 --> 4186.049
be honest with it okay I did you get the

4181.88 --> 4188.06
part about the the original conclusion

4186.049 --> 4190.94
of what makes light a particle about the

4188.06 --> 4192.4890000000005
energy quanta minimum for interaction

4190.94 --> 4194.9
with uncoil kills

4192.489 --> 4199.009999999999
that's what I would need you to reach

4194.9 --> 4201.469999999999
okay right so what I think that the

4199.01 --> 4206.39
assumption that light must be particle

4201.47 --> 4208.37
units are based are on the actual while

4206.39 --> 4209.75
first-hand physical proof that light

4208.37 --> 4212.36
even is a thing and that is its

4209.75 --> 4214.22
interaction with matter that is how it's

4212.36 --> 4219.62
registered and I think that they decided

4214.22 --> 4223.070000000001
upon what a light particle must be

4219.62 --> 4225.14
minimally based on the minimal register

4223.07 --> 4230.32
ability the minimal interaction with

4225.14 --> 4233.09
molecules because molecules are

4230.32 --> 4235.82
indivisible minimal

4233.09 --> 4239.03
sighs units and they will only respond

4235.82 --> 4244.07
at a minimal energy rates and a minimal

4239.03 --> 4247.7
energy interaction but does that prove

4244.07 --> 4249.86
that light is that minimum of that

4247.7 --> 4253.22
matter I think that the limit is at the

4249.86 --> 4257.21
matter and not at the light in this case

4253.22 --> 4260.18
right it's basically what you're saying

4257.21 --> 4263.81
is that all of quantum physics is

4260.18 --> 4270.530000000001
dependent upon pretty big assumptions

4263.81 --> 4272.51
about what light even is yes see well

4270.53 --> 4274.7
I'm not all yeah but not all of pontem

4272.51 --> 4277.070000000001
physics though but the mechanical

4274.7 --> 4282.16
framework for it and the theories that

4277.07 --> 4282.16
spring forth from that but the original

4282.31 --> 4286.7300000000005
basically the attempt to prove that

4284.81 --> 4289.39
there is more than physical things that

4286.73 --> 4291.919999999999
can interact with matter that part is

4289.39 --> 4293.06
also kind of the early part of quantum

4291.92 --> 4293.87
mechanics that's something totally

4293.06 --> 4297.05
separate

4293.87 --> 4299.9
it's where basically the mental starts

4297.05 --> 4302.3
to interact with the physical you could

4299.9 --> 4304.04
even yeah but then you get the issues

4302.3 --> 4306.85
like with psychology it is technically

4304.04 --> 4309.8
pseudoscience because it's ethereal and

4306.85 --> 4311.900000000001
that is also that is part of the origin

4309.8 --> 4314.18
of quantum mechanics that was brought

4311.9 --> 4318.32
forth with it when it was presented to

4314.18 --> 4321.200000000001
the world and so do you think light I

4318.32 --> 4323.389999999999
mean what do you think like this I think

4321.2 --> 4328.639999999999
light is an instantaneous energy

4323.39 --> 4332.360000000001
connection of potentially would

4328.64 --> 4335.63
infinitely divisible you think that

4332.36 --> 4337.4
would be classifiable as a wave or a

4335.63 --> 4339.83
particle or is it just it's completely

4337.4 --> 4342.58
outside of ennis not even a way of not

4339.83 --> 4347.12
even a part of it light has no speed I

4342.58 --> 4350.8099999999995
believe I think it is instantaneous how

4347.12 --> 4353.18
do you even prove such speeds in this

4350.81 --> 4356.21
realm there's no way there's no proof

4353.18 --> 4358.7300000000005
that it actually has a speed okay well

4356.21 --> 4360.83
here's a question though so part of the

4358.73 --> 4361.969999999999
reason they think it's a light and for

4360.83 --> 4364.91
that matter part of the reason they

4361.97 --> 4367.04
think it's a particle sorry a part of

4364.91 --> 4368.989
the reason I think it's a way of I mean

4367.04 --> 4370.1
so let's start with way part of the

4368.989 --> 4372.049999999999
reason they think it's a way it is

4370.1 --> 4374.570000000001
because of how it reacts when passing

4372.05 --> 4377.27
through the slit I mean isn't that

4374.57 --> 4379.37
correct like when it when it's behaving

4377.27 --> 4383.540000000001
as a way of meaning it's not the way

4379.37 --> 4386.33
from Deb it's not it's a wave pattern it

4383.54 --> 4388.489
results in a wave pattern but it's not

4386.33 --> 4390.83
act that doesn't make it a wave it just

4388.489 --> 4393.799999999999
seems likely if it's an apparent wave

4390.83 --> 4396.26
pattern right but that doesn't say

4393.8 --> 4399.35
anything about the actual nature of of

4396.26 --> 4402.77
the registry of those particle or of

4399.35 --> 4404.72
that light on the board because they

4402.77 --> 4408.05
assume it's a particle and that it makes

4404.72 --> 4410.54
choices every time where it lands but

4408.05 --> 4412.96
maybe it works slightly different maybe

4410.54 --> 4417.08
it's just a beam and that beam just

4412.96 --> 4422.36
we're splits up in a in a natural

4417.08 --> 4425.54
fashion I will disagree with you there I

4422.36 --> 4428.23
mean just because the effect of the

4425.54 --> 4431.63
light creates a wave-like pattern or a

4428.23 --> 4434.0599999999995
particle like pattern I think as a

4431.63 --> 4436.76
matter of pure skepticism I think you're

4434.06 --> 4440.9890000000005
you're right we that doesn't prove what

4436.76 --> 4443.95
the light is I mean I think I think it

4440.989 --> 4447.799999999999
suggests I think it highly suggests that

4443.95 --> 4450.47
it has what they've like at least it

4447.8 --> 4452.39
creates a wave-like effect on the

4450.47 --> 4454.9400000000005
collection board on the other side of

4452.39 --> 4457.79
the double slit but you're right but

4454.94 --> 4461.36
it's a landing point it's only the road

4457.79 --> 4463.91
that be splitting up can take it follows

4461.36 --> 4466.37
a specific pattern it's guided in a

4463.91 --> 4469.63
specific direction basically but I see

4466.37 --> 4472.04
it rather that they basically think

4469.63 --> 4474.29
conceptualized that a particle he hits

4472.04 --> 4476.78
separately every time now consider this

4474.29 --> 4479.51
what if that light that amount of light

4476.78 --> 4483.19
they're doing is like a river a river

4479.51 --> 4487.12
that splits up like the Amazon it goes

4483.19 --> 4490.5199999999995
specifically to those endpoints then a

4487.12 --> 4494.39
minimum the light is so amped up that

4490.52 --> 4496.9400000000005
certainly one of these endpoints gets

4494.39 --> 4498.59
just enough critical energies to start

4496.94 --> 4499.74
registering and that will then cause a

4498.59 --> 4503.67
blip there

4499.74 --> 4506.88
and how that is divided is due to the

4503.67 --> 4510.81
natural splitting up of the light beams

4506.88 --> 4513.39
and yeah if you just amp up the energy

4510.81 --> 4515.610000000001
output at the origin point then

4513.39 --> 4517.950000000001
eventually you get to that critical

4515.61 --> 4519.75
registerable point at some point and

4517.95 --> 4522.33
then a dot will register basically

4519.75 --> 4527.24
because of it but it's already spread

4522.33 --> 4530.13
out it's just not enough to register yet

4527.24 --> 4533.79
does that make sense how I explained it

4530.13 --> 4535.86
no it makes sense um I guess my question

4533.79 --> 4539.28
is do you think it would even be

4535.86 --> 4542.28
possible to ever determine what light

4539.28 --> 4544.32
even is like you think we can you know

4542.28 --> 4545.969999999999
capture it in a bottle study it and

4544.32 --> 4548.03
actually ever figure out what it is

4545.97 --> 4552.780000000001
because it almost seems like I can we

4548.03 --> 4554.19
can you that was an analogy I mean I was

4552.78 --> 4555.99
like metaphorical I don't literally mean

4554.19 --> 4557.969999999999
put in a bottle right my point is to put

4555.99 --> 4560.01
it under a microscope not literally I

4557.97 --> 4563.46
mean just to analyze it just scrutinize

4560.01 --> 4565.41
it to see what it is cuz look I'm not an

4563.46 --> 4569.49
expert but you can't you can see like

4565.41 --> 4573.3
you can only see either the point where

4569.49 --> 4576.0599999999995
the light is originating from the origin

4573.3 --> 4578.25
point where it manifests from and then

4576.06 --> 4580.4400000000005
yeah you get a direct connection or you

4578.25 --> 4583.62
have to see the light interacting with

4580.44 --> 4585.419999999999
something else you can't see what light

4583.62 --> 4589.34
is you can only see the interaction with

4585.42 --> 4589.34
matter well how do you know

4589.67 --> 4596.82
can you see you light can you see why in

4594.09 --> 4599.46
a perfect vacuum for except my point is

4596.82 --> 4601.83
I know that that's the mechanism that

4599.46 --> 4604.95
allows that that allows us to even see

4601.83 --> 4606.63
light I mean when when they pass light

4604.95 --> 4610.44
through a double slit and it creates

4606.63 --> 4612.81
wave-like patterns you say that's not

4610.44 --> 4615.0199999999995
enough to conclude what light is we

4612.81 --> 4617.160000000001
can't conclude light is away from that

4615.02 --> 4619.68
well I'm just saying well then how do we

4617.16 --> 4621.51
know that that's how light works I don't

4619.68 --> 4622.860000000001
you know like how do we know that it's

4621.51 --> 4624.54
actually bouncing off something and then

4622.86 --> 4627.0
it hits your eye like maybe there's a

4624.54 --> 4628.92
deeper mechanism it's not bouncing it's

4627.0 --> 4632.07
not really bouncing it is like an

4628.92 --> 4633.07
instantaneous connection from beginning

4632.07 --> 4637.329
to fall

4633.07 --> 4639.549999999999
absorption and you you mean like when

4637.329 --> 4642.489
you see it in your eyes no all the time

4639.55 --> 4644.679
just light like it's yeah we know it's

4642.489 --> 4650.049999999999
there because of we see because we see

4644.679 --> 4653.139
it but light upon creation of it when it

4650.05 --> 4655.4490000000005
manifests it just spreads out in

4653.139 --> 4662.2300000000005
instantaneous connection until it is

4655.449 --> 4663.549999999999
fully absorbed by matter right I don't

4662.23 --> 4666.968999999999
know enough about light to be honest

4663.55 --> 4670.889
with you but right but do you understand

4666.969 --> 4675.67
what I'm trying to explain it's just

4670.889 --> 4676.929
like in crystal light works I don't

4675.67 --> 4678.6990000000005
fully understand how life works so when

4676.929 --> 4680.619
you say it gets absorbed by matter I

4678.699 --> 4684.28
don't really know what that means if you

4680.619 --> 4685.929
get a library I guess well light is

4684.28 --> 4688.57
absorbed by matter that is even how you

4685.929 --> 4690.909
see things when it is absorbed by matter

4688.57 --> 4694.75
a bit of the energy is taken away and

4690.909 --> 4699.82
then can be transformed in for example

4694.75 --> 4701.829
heat right and if it doesn't absorb it

4699.82 --> 4704.19
then it'll just pass through or reflect

4701.829 --> 4707.23
and none of the energy will be lost and

4704.19 --> 4711.3099999999995
then its reach will be further but as

4707.23 --> 4715.2699999999995
its path as it goes as light basically

4711.31 --> 4717.79
follows or follows as it manifests the

4715.27 --> 4720.790000000001
instantaneous connection the connection

4717.79 --> 4723.82
goes up until the point where it just is

4720.79 --> 4726.909
fully absorbed by all the matter and

4723.82 --> 4730.48
that can even be gas if it is if the

4726.909 --> 4733.0
distance is vast enough you said earlier

4730.48 --> 4735.129999999999
I think you said something about light

4733.0 --> 4737.349
and travelling did you say it doesn't

4735.13 --> 4741.03
travel or something like no because

4737.349 --> 4744.159000000001
travel suggested trajectory it suggests

4741.03 --> 4747.009999999999
actual a pathway a beginning and end

4744.159 --> 4752.29
point that doesn't there is it just

4747.01 --> 4754.659000000001
manifests it just is bang right I think

4752.29 --> 4757.63
you also said it has no speed is that

4754.659 --> 4759.489
what you said right that is a necessity

4757.63 --> 4762.04
basically at it I'm still looking into

4759.489 --> 4766.8099999999995
supposed proof that actually proves that

4762.04 --> 4769.2699999999995
light does have a speed and how that is

4766.81 --> 4770.77
interpreted in the setup and then trust

4769.27 --> 4773.1
me it's going to be a man-made device

4770.77 --> 4776.530000000001
but I won't object to that necessarily

4773.1 --> 4779.650000000001
but I will look into draw the conclusion

4776.53 --> 4782.83
basically by no speed so that would mean

4779.65 --> 4786.839999999999
instantaneous well can light travel

4782.83 --> 4792.43
without a source that's a question so

4786.84 --> 4795.9400000000005
could for example could you insert light

4792.43 --> 4797.5
into a closed mirror room and then turn

4795.94 --> 4800.53
off the light source and the light would

4797.5 --> 4803.77
still be in that trap mirroring room and

4800.53 --> 4806.259999999999
then you open it up and you see the

4803.77 --> 4809.02
light coming out does that is does that

4806.26 --> 4811.900000000001
exist all right

4809.02 --> 4814.900000000001
or is it just presumed it is in there or

4811.9 --> 4817.389999999999
somehow measured to be in there without

4814.9 --> 4819.67
absorbing you know like how would they

4817.39 --> 4826.360000000001
know that light can exist separate from

4819.67 --> 4828.49
the spawning source that's another thing

4826.36 --> 4831.639999999999
I I don't even know where light comes

4828.49 --> 4834.07
from the I mean it does it have to be

4831.64 --> 4836.5
generated yes from a source I am I don't

4834.07 --> 4840.67
really know much about light well it's

4836.5 --> 4842.77
just energy when a key but yeah when

4840.67 --> 4845.62
energy is critical

4842.77 --> 4851.700000000001
within certain types of mass light

4845.62 --> 4855.3099999999995
spawns forth pretty crazy how that works

4851.7 --> 4856.95
right thank God we have a son hmm oh

4855.31 --> 4862.42
yeah

4856.95 --> 4864.07
literally oh yeah otherwise yeah it's

4862.42 --> 4868.72
funny it's a giant light bulb in the sky

4864.07 --> 4870.13
of convenient well yeah light bulb I

4868.72 --> 4873.52
don't I wouldn't call it a light bulb

4870.13 --> 4875.86
it's much more mysterious to me because

4873.52 --> 4879.160000000001
I literally consider it as a holographic

4875.86 --> 4881.92
phenomenon it's just light coming from

4879.16 --> 4884.889999999999
an apparent direction where we see the

4881.92 --> 4888.46
Sun disc at his epicenter but that

4884.89 --> 4890.200000000001
direction is relative to the observer so

4888.46 --> 4892.15
if there's a an observer at another

4890.2 --> 4895.63
position on the earth that lights that

4892.15 --> 4898.5
same apparent light position is coming

4895.63 --> 4898.5
from another direction

4901.869 --> 4913.159
right had a Wi-Fi hey can you still hear

4911.48 --> 4913.638999999999
me yes I can hear you again you broke up

4913.159 --> 4917.929
for a moment

4913.639 --> 4919.61
sorry I got a apologize I'm back um what

4917.929 --> 4921.5
I was gonna say was real quick was okay

4919.61 --> 4925.549999999999
so it's interesting that you say the

4921.5 --> 4927.349
light is relative to the observer is

4925.55 --> 4930.5
that basically what you said ran with

4927.349 --> 4937.429
the sunlight yes with the heavenly

4930.5 --> 4938.9
bodies all of them men your wife I

4937.429 --> 4939.71
really doesn't like us having this

4938.9 --> 4941.299999999999
conversation

4939.71 --> 4942.9800000000005
no it's at this time it's not the wife

4941.3 --> 4945.29
is that somebody keeps calling me

4942.98 --> 4945.709999999999
repeatedly and it cuts off the Skype my

4945.29 --> 4952.5199999999995
bad

4945.71 --> 4954.5
let's try time so you said that light is

4952.52 --> 4957.38
relative to the observer that basically

4954.5 --> 4961.73
what you said with the heavenly bodies

4957.38 --> 4963.56
light and that include right um yes so I

4961.73 --> 4965.75
see I find that interesting because that

4963.56 --> 4968.900000000001
that again reminds me of Hatem physics

4965.75 --> 4970.13
and a double slit experiment because one

4968.9 --> 4972.259999999999
of the inter and I know you have

4970.13 --> 4975.7390000000005
problems with you know the presumptions

4972.26 --> 4977.81
about all this stuff but my point is

4975.739 --> 4982.369
about the mental interaction the

4977.81 --> 4984.110000000001
personified aspect or because the

4982.369 --> 4985.848999999999
idealist interpretation of quantum

4984.11 --> 4988.58
physics and a double slit experiment

4985.849 --> 4996.219
basically says that you know these

4988.58 --> 4999.82
photons the hay or so you're breaking up

4996.219 --> 4999.82
can't repeat that please

5005.96 --> 5019.02
are you there again hello

5015.26 --> 5021.18
okay can you hear right yes that's

5019.02 --> 5023.070000000001
that's the third time somebody I'm so my

5021.18 --> 5023.46
god alright I was almost done let me

5023.07 --> 5025.88
finish

5023.46 --> 5030.99
I gotta go soon anyway let me just

5025.88 --> 5032.67
alright okay so so I was just it was

5030.99 --> 5036.41
just it just reminded me when you said

5032.67 --> 5038.79
that the Sun or the sun's light is

5036.41 --> 5041.28
dependent upon the it's like observer

5038.79 --> 5043.86
dependent basically it reminds me of how

5041.28 --> 5046.349999999999
the photons of light in the double slit

5043.86 --> 5049.32
experiment meant suggests that there is

5046.35 --> 5054.900000000001
a that things are dependent upon the

5049.32 --> 5056.19
subject you know where so anyways it's

5054.9 --> 5058.41
just an idea that hot them I thought I

5056.19 --> 5060.36
might sound your way or not no totally

5058.41 --> 5062.94
correct because as long as there's no

5060.36 --> 5066.03
particle assumption if you say there is

5062.94 --> 5070.62
a direct relation between the observer

5066.03 --> 5074.009999999999
and the lights emanation then I concur

5070.62 --> 5075.93
absolutely that is true it seems to be

5074.01 --> 5078.33
just like that and it's extremely

5075.93 --> 5081.030000000001
mysterious to me and I just I've been

5078.33 --> 5083.85
really curious to figure out if there's

5081.03 --> 5087.03
some kind of experiment or tests that

5083.85 --> 5090.570000000001
could be done to really prove that that

5087.03 --> 5092.94
it's really so relative that weird

5090.57 --> 5095.61
things start to manifest for example

5092.94 --> 5098.969999999999
just imagine there is a Sun where you're

5095.61 --> 5102.36
at and somewhat or yeah you're both

5098.97 --> 5104.400000000001
standing on the top of a mountain at a

5102.36 --> 5106.83
very fast distant from one another but

5104.4 --> 5108.719999999999
there's the clarity and you can with

5106.83 --> 5111.09
your camera zoom in on one another and

5108.72 --> 5113.13
really see each other pretty well

5111.09 --> 5116.52
because you're high up right over fast

5113.13 --> 5121.17
distances so are you still there by the

5116.52 --> 5123.39
way your god okay so imagine you're like

5121.17 --> 5124.89
fast distances and you're still can have

5123.39 --> 5128.400000000001
a direct outlook on one another now

5124.89 --> 5130.38
think one guy or whatever one person is

5128.4 --> 5133.41
gonna see the Sun from a specific angle

5130.38 --> 5135.54
and that Sun is going to give a specific

5133.41 --> 5137.37
shadow from them into there

5135.54 --> 5141.69
rection that they can see like there is

5137.37 --> 5144.51
my shadow well the other person that

5141.69 --> 5145.7699999999995
could see you maybe they're at a

5144.51 --> 5148.13
position where the Sun is at a

5145.77 --> 5151.200000000001
completely different angle

5148.13 --> 5155.400000000001
what if they then look towards the first

5151.2 --> 5157.86
person would that shadow be in at the

5155.4 --> 5160.259999999999
same position as that person would see

5157.86 --> 5163.29
themselves or what did they their shadow

5160.26 --> 5167.0
be displayed in relation to the apparent

5163.29 --> 5171.48
position of the Sun of the first person

5167.0 --> 5175.35
right well you know what that reminds me

5171.48 --> 5177.719999999999
of that reminds me of kind of reminds me

5175.35 --> 5180.72
of when you're standing like if you have

5177.72 --> 5184.740000000001
two people standing on a shoreline and

5180.72 --> 5189.030000000001
you've got the Sun setting and each

5184.74 --> 5190.5
person has their own bright light you

5189.03 --> 5192.09
know you know on the water if the sun's

5190.5 --> 5195.45
near the water you'll see like this

5192.09 --> 5197.88
bright light mm-hmm on the surface of

5195.45 --> 5199.86
the water that you know and each person

5197.88 --> 5203.01
has their own subjective little trail of

5199.86 --> 5205.53
light on the water reflecting and it

5203.01 --> 5207.54
literally is subjective because I can

5205.53 --> 5210.54
only see the one that's created for me

5207.54 --> 5212.85
and the person who's thirty yards away

5210.54 --> 5215.37
on the shoreline they can see the one

5212.85 --> 5217.200000000001
that's created for them but I can't see

5215.37 --> 5219.99
the one that they see and they can't see

5217.2 --> 5223.349999999999
the one that I see and the same goes for

5219.99 --> 5226.65
it crepuscular raised by the way did you

5223.35 --> 5229.14
know that we know I see light through

5226.65 --> 5230.7
the clouds there's this thing that the

5229.14 --> 5232.47
flatterers is love to emphasize this

5230.7 --> 5234.75
basically suggests that the Sun may be a

5232.47 --> 5237.21
lot closer you get this weird split up

5234.75 --> 5238.8
effect and you see beams of light going

5237.21 --> 5240.93
through the clouds and hitting below

5238.8 --> 5243.84
you've probably seen that everybody's

5240.93 --> 5247.38
seen that as right so what if another

5243.84 --> 5250.2300000000005
person again miles and miles away would

5247.38 --> 5253.2
be looking at that first person with a

5250.23 --> 5255.509999999999
zoomed in camera so then the Sun is

5253.2 --> 5258.21
going to be in another position I bet

5255.51 --> 5260.7
you they will not see those crepuscular

5258.21 --> 5263.81
rays hitting the surface where the first

5260.7 --> 5263.8099999999995
person is seeing them

5268.17 --> 5273.16
it's all very interesting and there's

5271.06 --> 5275.410000000001
somebody that actually did try that out

5273.16 --> 5281.3099999999995
what's his name again it's from the fe

5275.41 --> 5284.95
core team it's okay he changed his name

5281.31 --> 5288.76
did they get any any interesting result

5284.95 --> 5291.49
yeah they said they repeated that they

5288.76 --> 5293.62
said like yeah it's not in the same the

5291.49 --> 5295.99
Crepuscule erase the first person is

5293.62 --> 5297.79
seeing are not in the same literal

5295.99 --> 5300.84
location the first person is seeing them

5297.79 --> 5303.91
- the second person - the second fewer

5300.84 --> 5310.81
because the Sun is not behind the clouds

5303.91 --> 5311.17
- the second person so that's where you

5310.81 --> 5314.370000000001
go

5311.17 --> 5314.37
let there be light

5314.49 --> 5319.87
