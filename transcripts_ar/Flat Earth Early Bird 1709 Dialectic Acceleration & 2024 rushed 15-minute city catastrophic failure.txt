I don't know what that is

120.72 --> 127.579
but it seems warmer than yesterday

122.52 --> 127.579
there's very little wind barely any

132.84 --> 139.879
so yeah the wind Stillness really does

135.84 --> 139.879
up the apparent temperature

142.379 --> 146.12
but the sky is kind of hazy

157.62 --> 163.56
right

159.48 --> 166.56
anyway it is Sunday the 3rd of September

163.56 --> 166.56
2023

168.18 --> 170.72
sure

171.84 --> 176.18
22 degrees Celsius right

176.7 --> 180.14
low wind indeed

181.2 --> 185.819
hmm

183.42 --> 188.42
okay well maybe it is going to get a bit

185.819 --> 188.42

204.53 --> 207.629
[Music]

208.08 --> 211.58
hello Carl Taylor

212.459 --> 217.019
first in chat

214.26 --> 220.379
Dr utker good to see you

217.019 --> 223.04
you're not moving oh okay

220.379 --> 223.04
sure

225.78 --> 229.22
right yeah I got a title

229.739 --> 233.76
it's a play on word if you haven't

231.42 --> 236.33999999999997
spotted it

233.76 --> 240.0
but it's also very true

236.34 --> 241.31900000000002
I based this on I think that Nathan Miss

240.0 --> 243.959
Rhett

241.319 --> 245.819
somebody's Super Chat yesterday

243.959 --> 249.08
during the members only live stream

245.819 --> 249.07999999999998
after ballbusters

249.439 --> 254.72
I'm not mistaken I picked it up

252.299 --> 254.72
somewhere

256.4 --> 260.4
dialectic acceleration

261.06 --> 265.46
so close to dielectric isn't it

270.84 --> 277.4
right just what happens when you take

274.44 --> 277.4
out r

278.22 --> 283.139
you get something that's made up

280.38 --> 287.46
horseshit and you turn it into a very

283.139 --> 287.46000000000004
real esoteric situation

289.16 --> 294.139
post-apocalypse dialectic acceleration

296.16 --> 301.02000000000004
will be beautiful in the Netherlands

298.02 --> 304.4
yeah I guess it will

301.02 --> 304.4
hello flatter Sage

309.68 --> 314.94
right

311.419 --> 318.0
no Illuminati goes on today because I

314.94 --> 320.9
already ate one I had it before the show

318.0 --> 320.9
I was too hungry

329.28 --> 334.44
and of course minty oh yeah also I want

332.759 --> 338.24
to show

334.44 --> 338.24
my rosemary plants

344.96 --> 350.9
this is awesome look at this it just

347.699 --> 350.90000000000003
suddenly started blooming

351.539 --> 357.36
like I totally did not see that coming

353.52 --> 358.85999999999996
what is a super cute little

357.36 --> 361.02000000000004
Leela

358.86 --> 363.62
flowers

361.02 --> 363.62
amazing

370.28 --> 375.79999999999995
so that that's something I totally did

373.38 --> 375.8
not expect

376.08 --> 380.9
and overall the Rosemary is really

378.18 --> 380.90000000000003
hanging in there

381.84 --> 387.78
is needing more water than I expected

385.68 --> 391.94
but uh yeah

387.78 --> 391.94
it's doing it's doing just fine

402.419 --> 405.419
foreign

408.3 --> 415.919
spearmint it's it's growing and

411.96 --> 418.73999999999995
expanding like a young Empire it's crazy

415.919 --> 420.9
it's like really like oh yeah we can

418.74 --> 422.699
really go you can really go and then

420.9 --> 426.9
you're like

422.699 --> 429.36
like extra rootsers like going sideways

426.9 --> 431.15999999999997
to find more ground and more shoots and

429.36 --> 433.88
everywhere

431.16 --> 433.88000000000005
hmm

434.06 --> 440.18
rosemary blooms are delicious uh okay

440.58 --> 444.139
I'll leave it to the bees

450.38 --> 454.199
it's more to continue the more you'll

452.759 --> 457.22
need to water yeah that's a good point

454.199 --> 457.22
players eight

463.319 --> 469.86
well I'll have to find another big pot

465.96 --> 473.21999999999997
for that but I might order some of those

469.86 --> 476.599
like well whenever I'm like get out of

473.22 --> 478.56
this financially super dry period

476.599 --> 480.479
because

478.56 --> 483.9
yeah

480.479 --> 486.78
you know how it is like I'm already like

483.9 --> 489.479
in a phase where of the month very early

486.78 --> 492.419
on where I have to like really be

489.479 --> 494.75899999999996
careful with what I'm gonna spend

492.419 --> 497.9
otherwise I'm just gonna be completely

494.759 --> 497.90000000000003
broke very quickly

498.9 --> 505.19899999999996
unless I get more support in of course

503.039 --> 507.919
I mean I'm literally pretty much Gonna

505.199 --> 507.91900000000004
Get By

508.02 --> 516.0
like Monday thanks to dank's PayPal

512.58 --> 518.099
but yeah that's like not a lot for the

516.0 --> 520.8
entire week to be fair

518.099 --> 523.38
I got like another Fiverr before that

520.8 --> 526.92
but I mean guys

523.38 --> 531.5
this is not a reasonable income for

526.92 --> 531.5
these amounts of hours of quality time

532.32 --> 539.36
if I may say so

535.5 --> 539.36
so I really hope that

539.7 --> 544.26
things are gonna basically change around

541.74 --> 547.44
for you guys too for the better I don't

544.26 --> 550.26
know exactly how that would work

547.44 --> 552.36
maybe just up swings there have been a

550.26 --> 554.04
lot of down swings I've noticed and when

552.36 --> 556.019
there's down swings I'm not gonna really

554.04 --> 558.42
press too much

556.019 --> 560.399
but after a downswing there should be an

558.42 --> 562.88
upswing so I'm really hoping that you

560.399 --> 562.88
guys are gonna

562.92 --> 570.86
shoot off into space

566.1 --> 570.86
not literally that's not possible anyway

572.82 --> 578.0400000000001
so that you can help me

576.42 --> 579.3
survive

578.04 --> 581.8199999999999
here

579.3 --> 584.2199999999999
everything is really expensive it got

581.82 --> 586.62
more expensive like

584.22 --> 589.9200000000001
I think everything just got 10 percent

586.62 --> 593.18
more expensive which like like all the

589.92 --> 593.18
groceries is this really

594.18 --> 598.43
really mind-boggling like it's really

596.459 --> 600.779
tough

598.43 --> 603.66
[Music]

600.779 --> 605.0
so

603.66 --> 608.5799999999999
hello

605.0 --> 610.38
Ragnar Stefan helderson hey I recognize

608.58 --> 613.44
you that's

610.38 --> 615.8389999999999
that's a long time ago

613.44 --> 618.2600000000001
that's a really long time ago

615.839 --> 618.2600000000001
years

619.64 --> 624.62
yeah I'm still at it definitely still at

622.5 --> 624.62
it

626.64 --> 631.1
the last two shows have been absolutely

628.56 --> 631.0999999999999
amazing

633.839 --> 642.12
are we still a flat Earth what

638.519 --> 644.7
are we still a flat Earth

642.12 --> 646.86
are we still very terrible at

644.7 --> 649.5600000000001
constructing sentences

646.86 --> 652.399
or are we having a lot of trouble with

649.56 --> 652.399
autocorrect

659.12 --> 664.38
yeah or

661.74 --> 667.44
well I don't know about you but yeah the

664.38 --> 669.6
Earth is definitely flat

667.44 --> 672.24
geometric orientation of the earth's

669.6 --> 675.779
surface is flat

672.24 --> 680.04
the density this equilibrium Force

675.779 --> 683.3
directions the axis of it is perfectly

680.04 --> 683.3
parallel everywhere

684.3 --> 690.8389999999999
so there's no Vector change of

687.66 --> 692.8199999999999
of basically passive density based

690.839 --> 696.019
displacement

692.82 --> 696.019
it's all very

697.38 --> 704.459
flat oriented everything

701.339 --> 705.899
up is up and down are absolute

704.459 --> 708.06
directions

705.899 --> 709.86
and there was a lot of like during this

708.06 --> 710.88
last week on the Flight of the way the

709.86 --> 714.24
barge of

710.88 --> 715.98
uh more loose talk about that sort of

714.24 --> 717.54
thing with Tony and all that and I

715.98 --> 719.64
really just had to point out like uh

717.54 --> 721.38
yeah this is so [ __ ] you can't up

719.64 --> 725.279
and down are not the same as left and

721.38 --> 729.24
right they definitely are not

725.279 --> 730.92
right you can mistake something

729.24 --> 733.0790000000001
for being up and down by being

730.92 --> 735.7199999999999
disoriented but that doesn't make it

733.079 --> 738.3
actually up and down it just makes you

735.72 --> 740.82
mistaken and so

738.3 --> 742.8599999999999
I'm glad I was finally able to manifest

740.82 --> 744.779
that without everybody just immediately

742.86 --> 747.54
watching all over it

744.779 --> 750.6
which has happened like years ago when

747.54 --> 752.8199999999999
this first started coming up

750.6 --> 755.0
we're there for a thousand episodes yeah

752.82 --> 755.0
yeah

755.82 --> 759.5
so roughly two years ago

760.49 --> 764.54
[Music]

761.94 --> 764.5400000000001
oh

769.86 --> 777.32
three three years ago

773.279 --> 777.32
no way two yeah

780.42 --> 783.1999999999999
a little more

789.42 --> 797.16
right yeah so Ragnar Stefan halderson

793.32 --> 799.8000000000001
my show or me what I do how I do it is

797.16 --> 803.779
definitely changed around a lot

799.8 --> 803.779
since the thousandth episode I'd say

805.2 --> 810.0
episode

806.579 --> 811.88
ten thousand uh

810.0 --> 815.049
uh I don't think so dank

811.88 --> 815.049
[Music]

818.16 --> 821.459
I don't know if I could hold on that

820.5 --> 824.399
long

821.459 --> 828.38
and like especially like you did well I

824.399 --> 828.38
might but I mean that's pretty [ __ ] up

828.54 --> 831.959
I mean at some point it's just gonna be

830.519 --> 835.079
neurotic

831.959 --> 837.8389999999999
after so many decades it's just going to

835.079 --> 840.2399999999999
be like hey are we like

837.839 --> 844.139
you really can move on you know it's

840.24 --> 849.019
like I gotta do an early bird show I

844.139 --> 849.019
gotta get to that ten thousand like uh

855.899 --> 862.44
I mean let's just go for the 3300 I

859.8 --> 864.779
think that's a pretty good aim

862.44 --> 867.72
that might be just around the alleged

864.779 --> 870.3
end of the world at the peak of the New

867.72 --> 872.639
World Order agenda 2030 around really

870.3 --> 874.079
seriously I think that

872.639 --> 876.779
episode

874.079 --> 878.88
3300

876.779 --> 883.62
would be somewhere

878.88 --> 884.399
in 2033 or in 2030 I mean which is like

883.62 --> 887.82
that

884.399 --> 890.04
that data points and it's really weird

887.82 --> 893.12
because it directly relates to something

890.04 --> 893.12
that I experienced

893.519 --> 896.88
like

894.72 --> 900.3000000000001
potentially in dark world but probably

896.88 --> 903.24
not no weight it was or was it half it

900.3 --> 905.2199999999999
was in reality but it was so tense that

903.24 --> 907.5600000000001
it was like hallucinating half Dark

905.22 --> 909.24
World over it yeah I've had like Middle

907.56 --> 911.16
Ground experiences

909.24 --> 916.019
where I'm basically facing something

911.16 --> 918.24
that's so dark but instead of flipping

916.019 --> 921.3
I start to hallucinate the Dark World

918.24 --> 924.6
Around the actual physical situation

921.3 --> 927.899
it's pretty freaky when that happens

924.6 --> 932.839
only happen a few times but

927.899 --> 932.839
like 2030 was named to me I like

933.44 --> 938.5790000000001
[Music]

935.16 --> 940.62
it was so weird it's like

938.579 --> 944.0999999999999
they said

940.62 --> 948.12
or the devil potentially right the the

944.1 --> 951.24
Jesuit guy figure in the vision perhaps

948.12 --> 954.839
or yeah it was not the real one

951.24 --> 959.0
ah what is like that situation that I

954.839 --> 959.0
earlier vaguely described led to this

959.22 --> 964.5
and he said like yeah we're gonna go for

961.68 --> 969.7199999999999
2020.

964.5 --> 973.019
and I said like no you gotta make it 33.

969.72 --> 975.24
remain for 23 and I said it had to be 33

973.019 --> 977.579
of course because of the number

975.24 --> 980.36
and I don't know I guess the devil

977.579 --> 980.3599999999999
agreed or something

981.0 --> 987.139
these are like really weird experiences

984.72 --> 991.279
these type of flashy things it's like

987.139 --> 991.279
did I just like

991.92 --> 995.0999999999999
make

993.54 --> 997.86
the beasts

995.1 --> 1002.139
change their plans

997.86 --> 1002.139
I'm not sure what that was

1004.399 --> 1008.839
right

1006.38 --> 1011.6
but uh yeah that

1008.839 --> 1012.8000000000001
might also relate to me having saved the

1011.6 --> 1015.38
world

1012.8 --> 1018.88
the thing is I can never be sure I just

1015.38 --> 1018.88
remember experiencing that

1019.22 --> 1025.579
like convincing the the devil with just

1022.579 --> 1030.9189999999999
a good guy face or whatever that was

1025.579 --> 1034.48
like no no you gotta you gotta do 30.

1030.919 --> 1034.48
like 20 makes no sense

1035.089 --> 1038.339
[Music]

1039.14 --> 1042.7990000000002
anyway

1040.7 --> 1044.02

1046.819 --> 1051.22
dank Nathan Oakley let's see you

1064.22 --> 1068.72
can Orwin convert the last wallet or

1067.46 --> 1071.059
last follower

1068.72 --> 1073.88
that's ridiculous

1071.059 --> 1076.22
you think that at the 10K episode there

1073.88 --> 1079.0
are any Ballers left

1076.22 --> 1079.0
no way

1079.52 --> 1085.52
I mean maybe in 10 years

1082.76 --> 1088.34
but I mean after that

1085.52 --> 1090.86
things are gonna like be like seriously

1088.34 --> 1093.32
rearranged and there's just no

1090.86 --> 1095.059
there it won't be part of the plan

1093.32 --> 1097.3999999999999
anymore

1095.059 --> 1098.539
it's like the time has run out for that

1097.4 --> 1103.179
phase

1098.539 --> 1103.179
it's all part of the big system plan

1104.78 --> 1108.62
right

1106.1 --> 1112.6399999999999
I mean the newer Generations are gonna

1108.62 --> 1117.52
be yapping much crazier [ __ ]

1112.64 --> 1117.5200000000002
than that they won't even care about it

1117.86 --> 1121.12
they're going to be preoccupied with all

1119.66 --> 1124.96
this like

1121.12 --> 1124.9599999999998
bizarre psycho

1125.6 --> 1129.4399999999998
anomalous behaviors

1127.76 --> 1132.3799999999999
they're all going to be Frick made

1129.44 --> 1135.6200000000001
obsessed with it they already are

1132.38 --> 1137.0
like that's not just gonna go away

1135.62 --> 1138.9189999999999
quickly

1137.0 --> 1141.26
it's like yeah everybody can disagree

1138.919 --> 1142.4
but that won't actually make them stop

1141.26 --> 1144.44
doing it

1142.4 --> 1146.9
and all those that are already grafted

1144.44 --> 1149.1200000000001
in they're gonna want it too

1146.9 --> 1151.46
it's like

1149.12 --> 1153.559
yeah like a cult like a Ponzi scheme

1151.46 --> 1157.66
that's once they started

1153.559 --> 1157.66
like they're not gonna cut it off

1158.12 --> 1162.26
they might be discouraged they might be

1159.98 --> 1164.3600000000001
slowed down but they're non-stop they're

1162.26 --> 1165.62
just gonna roll it out until it's

1164.36 --> 1168.74
complete

1165.62 --> 1170.6599999999999
like no matter the cost pretty much and

1168.74 --> 1172.64
hey if they can't hurry it up because

1170.66 --> 1174.799
everybody's aware of it well then they

1172.64 --> 1178.179
just take their sweet ass time but they

1174.799 --> 1178.179
are not actually gonna stop

1180.14 --> 1182.6200000000001
yeah

1183.08 --> 1189.82
because the rollout of like cultures

1187.22 --> 1189.82
like

1190.039 --> 1195.74
it transcends

1192.679 --> 1197.179
the Contemporary goal of the generations

1195.74 --> 1200.08
basically

1197.179 --> 1200.0800000000002
within the plan

1207.02 --> 1212.9
don't ask me how I know this [ __ ] it's

1209.72 --> 1217.1200000000001
weird it's wizard stuff

1212.9 --> 1217.1200000000001
hanging with the Mages in the Dark World

1219.23 --> 1224.44
[Music]

1226.7 --> 1232.219
84 Casey

1229.16 --> 1232.219
[Music]

1243.6 --> 1246.6799999999998
[Music]

1251.48 --> 1258.02
yeah it's our Casey yeah according to

1254.84 --> 1260.1789999999999
the official system but that's why

1258.02 --> 1261.62
the calendar has been messed with

1260.179 --> 1264.02
enormously

1261.62 --> 1265.52
is pretty known that's like a thousand

1264.02 --> 1268.7
years added

1265.52 --> 1271.46
very logical conclusion to draw

1268.7 --> 1273.559
like history is not what has been made

1271.46 --> 1274.52
in the picture that we get to learn in

1273.559 --> 1276.5
school

1274.52 --> 1278.72
yeah sure a lot of these things happen

1276.5 --> 1282.38
some of them have been made up and some

1278.72 --> 1285.559
of them have been misplaced like

1282.38 --> 1289.22
they basically took a thousand years

1285.559 --> 1290.84
created a gap and then displaced

1289.22 --> 1293.24
things

1290.84 --> 1295.6399999999999
that it actually happened outside of the

1293.24 --> 1299.059
Earth's fictional thousand years and

1295.64 --> 1303.0200000000002
then like moved them around within those

1299.059 --> 1306.74
fictional thousand years to like

1303.02 --> 1309.62
set up other suggested events and things

1306.74 --> 1311.659
it's complex it was probably a huge

1309.62 --> 1314.6
project

1311.659 --> 1316.22
when that was done very complicated all

1314.6 --> 1320.26
the scholars would have been busy with

1316.22 --> 1320.26
it basically creating a false history

1325.33 --> 1328.4199999999998
[Music]

1329.72 --> 1336.799
so when the date matters it's really

1334.58 --> 1338.539
purely about the numbers and the effect

1336.799 --> 1342.2
on the psyche

1338.539 --> 1344.179
because there is no the actual time

1342.2 --> 1346.72
period

1344.179 --> 1350.24
between something in the past and now

1346.72 --> 1353.84
it's literally irrelevant

1350.24 --> 1357.64
because we don't know exactly what

1353.84 --> 1357.6399999999999
things how long ago they were really

1358.52 --> 1364.94
it's all rough estimation so exact dates

1363.2 --> 1366.98
are not really going to do anything

1364.94 --> 1368.96
because everything is off we don't know

1366.98 --> 1371.419
the exact dates because our calendars

1368.96 --> 1373.1000000000001
have been [ __ ] with so badly for so

1371.419 --> 1376.179
long that

1373.1 --> 1376.1789999999999
is lost

1377.179 --> 1381.44
and there's so many suggestions of what

1379.34 --> 1384.08
it could be that even between those

1381.44 --> 1386.299
there's no certainty

1384.08 --> 1389.4189999999999
it's just loss it's become a mess

1386.299 --> 1392.12
so the only real influence is the

1389.419 --> 1394.76
numbers themselves on the psyche and

1392.12 --> 1396.26
things like Gematria

1394.76 --> 1399.559
right

1396.26 --> 1402.74
actual time doesn't matter really

1399.559 --> 1405.98
in relation to that the numbers and

1402.74 --> 1407.179
their influence is what matters in that

1405.98 --> 1409.1
case

1407.179 --> 1412.159
so that's

1409.1 --> 1414.3799999999999
how I think it works it really is about

1412.159 --> 1416.24
the literal numbers because they're the

1414.38 --> 1418.0390000000002
only one that's the thing that you get

1416.24 --> 1420.32
shoved in your face all the time that's

1418.039 --> 1423.34
the clock that's the day

1420.32 --> 1426.4399999999998
those are the numbers you get to see

1423.34 --> 1427.76
actual time is really Irrelevant in that

1426.44 --> 1429.6200000000001
game

1427.76 --> 1432.62
it's only the

1429.62 --> 1435.82
the claimed system numbers

1432.62 --> 1435.82
that matter anyway

1438.559 --> 1441.52
foreign

1450.44 --> 1456.5800000000002
enough

1453.35 --> 1456.58
[Music]

1462.14 --> 1467.539
I most

1464.6 --> 1470.36
most people that

1467.539 --> 1473.44
scheme to get power and all that and

1470.36 --> 1474.799
scheme and murder and genocide even

1473.44 --> 1476.72
[Music]

1474.799 --> 1478.94
well when you get power you got this

1476.72 --> 1481.58
unique opportunity thanks to Satan

1478.94 --> 1485.919
because of the absolute power to

1481.58 --> 1485.9189999999999
literally just start rewriting history

1487.7 --> 1493.28
and that's

1489.74 --> 1495.919
what is kept like

1493.28 --> 1498.5
that's part of the Beast system is that

1495.919 --> 1499.94
fake histories are caps and it's like if

1498.5 --> 1501.74
you're gonna make a fake history It's

1499.94 --> 1503.8400000000001
gotta fit in between the other fake

1501.74 --> 1506.86
histories

1503.84 --> 1506.86
that's how they work

1509.299 --> 1514.8799999999999
if it doesn't really fit then well it's

1513.14 --> 1517.159
sort of like it's just kept

1514.88 --> 1519.919
compartmentalized as something obscure

1517.159 --> 1522.8600000000001
and uncertain

1519.919 --> 1526.5800000000002
it's like occult history that's and then

1522.86 --> 1529.6399999999999
they don't graft it in they don't

1526.58 --> 1534.1589999999999
open it up to the official line and they

1529.64 --> 1534.159
don't make it fit you see

1537.5 --> 1541.48
so in reality we should probably

1541.58 --> 1546.1999999999998
as we figure out what actually is the

1545.059 --> 1549.1399999999999
history

1546.2 --> 1551.96
compartment lies for ourselves that

1549.14 --> 1555.1000000000001
there is like the system history the

1551.96 --> 1555.1000000000001
official histories

1555.679 --> 1562.5800000000002
which is what got together

1559.039 --> 1565.46
and formed what we get taught in school

1562.58 --> 1568.1589999999999
and then there is what probably really

1565.46 --> 1572.98
happened which is likely very different

1568.159 --> 1572.98
in many ways and much more grim

1573.14 --> 1578.3600000000001
and much less glorious and more

1575.84 --> 1580.52
treachery and just all the [ __ ] up

1578.36 --> 1582.3799999999999
things of humanity you can ever imagine

1580.52 --> 1584.6589999999999
combined

1582.38 --> 1587.8400000000001
making it seem like people are all

1584.659 --> 1589.7
Devils just clinging and and stamping on

1587.84 --> 1591.98
other people's heads for power all the

1589.7 --> 1594.2
time is probably what it would look like

1591.98 --> 1596.539
if we had a complete picture

1594.2 --> 1598.82
but anything that's basically connected

1596.539 --> 1600.5
to that reality of how things probably

1598.82 --> 1602.539
happened

1600.5 --> 1606.2
if there's any trace of it even left

1602.539 --> 1609.34
we'll probably be seen as like up

1606.2 --> 1609.3400000000001
occult history

1611.12 --> 1615.9189999999999
and it's not gonna

1613.48 --> 1619.159
easily fit

1615.919 --> 1622.039
the system history

1619.159 --> 1624.2
because it's not been adapted like the

1622.039 --> 1627.98
system history is made to fit all

1624.2 --> 1631.3600000000001
together because it's all been adapted

1627.98 --> 1631.3600000000001
to fit like a story

1631.7 --> 1636.0800000000002
right his story

1634.34 --> 1639.559
wow

1636.08 --> 1644.9189999999999
how things actually transpired are all

1639.559 --> 1644.9189999999999
a lot of chaotic things and it doesn't

1646.22 --> 1650.26
it's very difficult to really

1650.419 --> 1657.0200000000002
have oversight because yeah people

1653.539 --> 1659.24
are very complicated in reality

1657.02 --> 1662.179
they're more complicated than they make

1659.24 --> 1663.98
themselves look

1662.179 --> 1665.3600000000001
to the outside world and present

1663.98 --> 1666.8600000000001
themselves and how they write about

1665.36 --> 1669.08
themselves

1666.86 --> 1672.4399999999998
right

1669.08 --> 1676.6399999999999
so to actually really get the complete

1672.44 --> 1679.48
reality picture of how things happen is

1676.64 --> 1679.48
very strenuous

1680.48 --> 1684.799
it's very hard to oversee

1682.82 --> 1686.48
because you're dealing with actual

1684.799 --> 1689.0
people

1686.48 --> 1691.96
and the complexity of actual people and

1689.0 --> 1691.96
how things really happen

1692.559 --> 1700.1
right and

1695.2 --> 1702.0800000000002
alongside that reality well

1700.1 --> 1704.12
Consciousness doesn't really deal well

1702.08 --> 1706.6
with the Grim parts of reality

1704.12 --> 1709.2199999999998
especially if it's just

1706.6 --> 1711.1999999999998
like if it's a person that you really

1709.22 --> 1713.179
like like the way they do things and

1711.2 --> 1714.799
they do something really terrible all of

1713.179 --> 1717.3200000000002
a sudden

1714.799 --> 1719.12
you don't want that your Consciousness

1717.32 --> 1721.58
literally doesn't want that

1719.12 --> 1724.779
it will try to blot it out it will try

1721.58 --> 1724.779
to hold on to the good

1724.94 --> 1730.1000000000001
those types of effects right the

1726.799 --> 1732.799
aesthetic mind well that later on we'll

1730.1 --> 1734.539
literally remember the corrected version

1732.799 --> 1735.86
that's how it happens if it kind of

1734.539 --> 1738.14
lingers to the background it doesn't

1735.86 --> 1739.4599999999998
burden you for a very long time just

1738.14 --> 1741.98
goes through the background well then

1739.46 --> 1744.2
you look back and it's like like oh no

1741.98 --> 1746.72
it's just a mistake and

1744.2 --> 1749.96
and you want you will forget that he was

1746.72 --> 1754.279
like the person that got dark was really

1749.96 --> 1756.679
like yeah and just like being sadistic

1754.279 --> 1760.779
and like really enjoying the evil you're

1756.679 --> 1760.779
like you'll forget about that [ __ ]

1761.72 --> 1767.299
because that those devilish parts of

1764.899 --> 1770.299
humans

1767.299 --> 1772.52
it it it refuses to fit

1770.299 --> 1775.059
in your memory like you don't want to

1772.52 --> 1775.059
know that

1775.52 --> 1780.799
so if you take that static mind

1777.799 --> 1783.74
correction of Darkness that you can't

1780.799 --> 1786.1399999999999
deal with really consciously if you take

1783.74 --> 1790.039
that into account also well then it just

1786.14 --> 1793.88
becomes really difficult to actually

1790.039 --> 1797.96
figure out what really happened

1793.88 --> 1799.0200000000002
you see even with writings and testimony

1797.96 --> 1802.059
and [ __ ]

1799.02 --> 1802.059
[Music]

1805.22 --> 1809.779
because if it's not first hand and even

1807.74 --> 1811.82
if it is first if it's like a first-hand

1809.779 --> 1814.399
experience then still your mind is going

1811.82 --> 1817.8799999999999
to try to play tricks on you because you

1814.399 --> 1820.6999999999998
don't want to have that complete dark

1817.88 --> 1822.0800000000002
reality that you witnessed in your

1820.7 --> 1824.24
memory

1822.08 --> 1826.6
so can you imagine what it is like to

1824.24 --> 1826.6
have like

1826.82 --> 1833.299
second or third and Witnesses

1830.779 --> 1835.76
you're gonna have all these barriers in

1833.299 --> 1837.32
between all not really wanting to deal

1835.76 --> 1840.3799999999999
with reality

1837.32 --> 1844.059
about it it's so difficult to really

1840.38 --> 1844.0590000000002
figure out dark things

1844.7 --> 1849.22
through other people it's practically

1846.559 --> 1849.22
impossible

1851.36 --> 1857.9189999999999
because

1853.48 --> 1862.24
people would rather in their personal

1857.919 --> 1865.3990000000001
preferences people rather make dark

1862.24 --> 1869.24
iconic figures that are really

1865.399 --> 1871.82
interesting and fascinating then to make

1869.24 --> 1874.58
the actual [ __ ] upness

1871.82 --> 1877.82
of people the actual darkness is really

1874.58 --> 1880.1589999999999
not that enjoyable and aesthetic it's

1877.82 --> 1883.82
just really hurts

1880.159 --> 1885.7600000000002
it just really really hurts there's

1883.82 --> 1889.34
nothing

1885.76 --> 1891.44
entertaining about it really

1889.34 --> 1893.0
the actual Darkness

1891.44 --> 1896.24
see

1893.0 --> 1898.52
so it's very hard to actually explain to

1896.24 --> 1902.86
somebody how [ __ ] up actual darkness

1898.52 --> 1907.279
is and people would rather make up

1902.86 --> 1910.82
scary stories and like all Rogue men and

1907.279 --> 1914.059
rituals and all baby sacrifices and it's

1910.82 --> 1916.6399999999999
like because that speaks to the

1914.059 --> 1920.12
imagination and it's like more palatable

1916.64 --> 1924.159
because of the theatrics

1920.12 --> 1924.1589999999999
that's surrounded yeah

1926.12 --> 1932.2399999999998
then they would tell they would people

1929.539 --> 1935.299
would rather tell that about evil and

1932.24 --> 1936.679
spread like get try to get people's

1935.299 --> 1938.9189999999999
attention to it hey there is really

1936.679 --> 1942.3200000000002
youth out there with stories like that

1938.919 --> 1946.159
which in reality will be extremely rare

1942.32 --> 1948.559
or purely as a bluff yeah people will

1946.159 --> 1951.74
dress up pretend to do something like

1948.559 --> 1953.539
that just to freak out a person

1951.74 --> 1955.82
because they're playing on and they're

1953.539 --> 1957.74
trying to manipulate them Bluff him that

1955.82 --> 1959.96
things are really [ __ ] up

1957.74 --> 1964.72
and that is really in danger if he

1959.96 --> 1964.72
doesn't cooperate yeah yeah yeah Bluff

1965.36 --> 1969.9799999999998
people would rather

1967.159 --> 1973.64
hear stories about such things being

1969.98 --> 1976.58
real then the actual dark [ __ ] up

1973.64 --> 1978.3200000000002
reality of how they operate

1976.58 --> 1980.84
with utter

1978.32 --> 1983.74
carelessness and contempt with life it's

1980.84 --> 1983.74
like yeah it's

1984.799 --> 1989.4189999999999
like they just don't care about life but

1987.38 --> 1991.3990000000001
they don't like want to destroy it it's

1989.419 --> 1993.8600000000001
just that

1991.399 --> 1996.1399999999999
life they don't have room in their plan

1993.86 --> 1998.36
for life to continue existing right it's

1996.14 --> 2000.159
more like that it's like it's pure

1998.36 --> 2005.1589999999999
recklessness

2000.159 --> 2010.72
pure carelessness and and that's really

2005.159 --> 2014.14
very painful to have your conscious sit

2010.72 --> 2016.659
in that reality in that realization

2014.14 --> 2022.2
that it's that and it's not

2016.659 --> 2022.2
some monster that you can catch

2025.059 --> 2032.08
it's the real problem is people that

2028.539 --> 2033.539
have allowed the devil metaphorically to

2032.08 --> 2039.84
cut out

2033.539 --> 2039.84
normal human emotional social functions

2040.179 --> 2046.6200000000001
so that the person becomes morally

2043.779 --> 2046.62
deranged

2046.72 --> 2055.78
where they ignore critical things

2051.399 --> 2058.96
because of personal short-term gain

2055.78 --> 2062.8790000000004
and that's the real evil and it's very

2058.96 --> 2062.879
hard to really feel that

2063.82 --> 2070.5
and consciously live with that that's

2067.78 --> 2070.5
actually tough

2071.139 --> 2078.339
because it makes the caring tougher

2075.879 --> 2080.2
it's like you're trying to hold on to

2078.339 --> 2082.0
good you're it's like I'm doing I'm

2080.2 --> 2084.2799999999997
holding on to good and then to know that

2082.0 --> 2087.659
there are people that are just like

2084.28 --> 2087.659
[ __ ] all of that

2088.179 --> 2091.839
let's

2089.5 --> 2094.419
it's really

2091.839 --> 2096.46
painful

2094.419 --> 2098.6189999999997
that people that are out there that

2096.46 --> 2100.599
literally cannot be made to care and

2098.619 --> 2102.6400000000003
they'll just destroy it

2100.599 --> 2104.98
not because they hate it even but

2102.64 --> 2108.2799999999997
because they don't care

2104.98 --> 2111.28
they it's like oh it's just collateral

2108.28 --> 2113.619
damage because they don't care

2111.28 --> 2116.2000000000003
right and that's the type of evil we're

2113.619 --> 2119.52
dealing with with BlackRock

2116.2 --> 2119.52
they are like that

2120.4 --> 2126.52
completely psychopathic

2123.339 --> 2130.32
they just don't care for the damage they

2126.52 --> 2133.48
only care for power and profit

2130.32 --> 2137.079
they'll like they'll freaking kill their

2133.48 --> 2140.619
own grandmother right they'll do that

2137.079 --> 2143.5
I I bet like inside of BlackRock on the

2140.619 --> 2145.1800000000003
bigger tiers in the Inner Circle I bet

2143.5 --> 2148.119
they do have like

2145.18 --> 2150.8199999999997
murder your own grandmother type of

2148.119 --> 2153.359
initiation I bet they actually do that

2150.82 --> 2153.3590000000004
sort of [ __ ]

2155.38 --> 2162.0
because of the very nature of the entire

2158.76 --> 2162.0
BlackRock system

2163.3 --> 2166.9
like they can't have people that have

2165.04 --> 2169.2
sentimentality

2166.9 --> 2172.2400000000002
they don't want that because

2169.2 --> 2174.8199999999997
sentimentality gets in the way of their

2172.24 --> 2176.7999999999997
cold heart brutal

2174.82 --> 2180.7000000000003
profit

2176.8 --> 2180.7000000000003
raking operation

2184.72 --> 2187.2599999999998
anyway

2193.0 --> 2199.72
burning at Burning Man this year

2196.42 --> 2201.4
uh no not really slow-mo I did notice

2199.72 --> 2204.04
that there were some stupid climate

2201.4 --> 2206.859
activists that had to get dragged off

2204.04 --> 2209.82
the street by police

2206.859 --> 2209.8199999999997
I noticed that

2212.079 --> 2219.28
so maybe maybe there's finally gonna be

2215.74 --> 2222.22
a real split up now I mean

2219.28 --> 2224.92
the one thing I know is that burning man

2222.22 --> 2228.0989999999997
is like this holy thing for

2224.92 --> 2230.44
for the Liberals right

2228.099 --> 2232.96
there's this religious thing about it

2230.44 --> 2235.359
that they do like that's the real

2232.96 --> 2237.52
freedom and creativity and

2235.359 --> 2240.0989999999997
and whatever

2237.52 --> 2242.079
well the climate activists are so

2240.099 --> 2245.1400000000003
[ __ ] idiotic

2242.079 --> 2249.04
like they are like those old annoying

2245.14 --> 2251.3199999999997
Bible people sorry the the bad ones like

2249.04 --> 2253.2
that are just really [ __ ] stupid and

2251.32 --> 2257.2000000000003
just like

2253.2 --> 2259.359
like Jehovah's right so these climate

2257.2 --> 2261.16
activates are kind of like the Jehovahs

2259.359 --> 2263.2599999999998
of the atheists

2261.16 --> 2264.5989999999997
and if they're gonna get in the way of

2263.26 --> 2268.119
Burning Man

2264.599 --> 2272.099
that's gonna like create as a spiritual

2268.119 --> 2272.099
Civil War among liberals

2272.32 --> 2275.82
and they're gonna detach

2275.92 --> 2280.96
like they're gonna disconnect from the

2278.2 --> 2283.7799999999997
climate cultists

2280.96 --> 2285.82
that's a kind of a weird prediction but

2283.78 --> 2287.8
I feel that I feel it coming I feel that

2285.82 --> 2290.8590000000004
there's gonna be

2287.8 --> 2293.44
a spiritual Civil War among the Liberals

2290.859 --> 2295.42
because of the climate cultists that are

2293.44 --> 2298.96
crossing all lines like they are being

2295.42 --> 2301.96
two marxists on their own

2298.96 --> 2303.64
Inner Circle culture

2301.96 --> 2305.88
right

2303.64 --> 2308.859
and once they do that it's it's over

2305.88 --> 2312.04
it's like there's like Liberals are

2308.859 --> 2315.0989999999997
gonna like really [ __ ] hate

2312.04 --> 2316.72
the climate cost it's gonna be like are

2315.099 --> 2320.079
like they're never gonna get along ever

2316.72 --> 2321.52
again which is great because [ __ ] the

2320.079 --> 2324.7000000000003
climate cultist

2321.52 --> 2326.82
it can all burn in hell

2324.7 --> 2326.8199999999997
okay

2335.94 --> 2342.66
wait what rained hard 70k people trapped

2340.119 --> 2342.6600000000003
what

2345.94 --> 2352.0
okay I did not know about that slo-mo

2349.359 --> 2354.4
moon buggy

2352.0 --> 2356.7
did that just happen or something that's

2354.4 --> 2356.7000000000003
weird

2373.0 --> 2376.38
I had no idea

2384.04 --> 2386.46
right

2387.88 --> 2392.32
okay

2389.82 --> 2394.079
anyway I feel it's going to happen more

2392.32 --> 2397.54
and more it's like

2394.079 --> 2399.52
boo left right the the Liberals and not

2397.54 --> 2402.82
all Liberals are completely [ __ ]

2399.52 --> 2405.099
Marxist crazy people thank you

2402.82 --> 2407.619
well there's a lot of left-wing people

2405.099 --> 2409.839
it's only natural that they came into

2407.619 --> 2412.06
being after all the push of that

2409.839 --> 2415.24
especially during the 90s

2412.06 --> 2418.06
in the early 2000s

2415.24 --> 2419.859
they were going to be a lot there were

2418.06 --> 2422.2
gonna be a lot of liberals naturally

2419.859 --> 2424.5989999999997
like Grassroots liberals

2422.2 --> 2427.359
not system liberals

2424.599 --> 2428.98
and they are now getting to the point

2427.359 --> 2430.839
where they can't handle this [ __ ]

2428.98 --> 2434.079
anymore they can't handle the Marxist

2430.839 --> 2436.72
[ __ ] the ruination of the culture that

2434.079 --> 2439.92
the endless peer pressure or [ __ ] that

2436.72 --> 2439.9199999999996
they're getting subjected to

2440.02 --> 2444.28
like they're sick of it

2442.24 --> 2447.3999999999996
like at first it was kind of fun because

2444.28 --> 2449.76
they the those system liberals would go

2447.4 --> 2449.76
after

2450.04 --> 2454.24
like

2451.78 --> 2456.0400000000004
like just right-wing extremists yeah

2454.24 --> 2458.02
there used to be actual right-win

2456.04 --> 2461.38
extremists that were really like super

2458.02 --> 2463.66
rude and just [ __ ] up in their own way

2461.38 --> 2466.78
and so they were like yeah go after them

2463.66 --> 2468.22
yeah haha but those are like therefore

2466.78 --> 2470.619
run out

2468.22 --> 2472.54
like those people don't do that anymore

2470.619 --> 2473.56
really they're like somewhere in the

2472.54 --> 2476.56
corner

2473.56 --> 2478.42
or another country or whatever they are

2476.56 --> 2480.64
in jail who knows

2478.42 --> 2482.6800000000003
but

2480.64 --> 2485.02
like those system liberals they didn't

2482.68 --> 2487.06
stop they just keep moving the Border

2485.02 --> 2489.9
it's like nothing is liberal enough and

2487.06 --> 2493.0
they just started with the worst most

2489.9 --> 2496.42
right-wing things and they just keep on

2493.0 --> 2498.82
moving the Border board and it's like no

2496.42 --> 2500.32
like at some point they will get to the

2498.82 --> 2503.8
point where

2500.32 --> 2506.92
if you're an OB gbtq whatever

2503.8 --> 2510.4
movement and you're not like you don't

2506.92 --> 2514.0
have the proper body modification then

2510.4 --> 2518.7400000000002
you're not really one of them like they

2514.0 --> 2521.68
keep moving that [ __ ] bar forever

2518.74 --> 2524.4399999999996
and like regular liberals

2521.68 --> 2528.2799999999997
they are like [ __ ] that

2524.44 --> 2530.44
it's horseshit and like it was harshit

2528.28 --> 2533.02
for a while but now if they're gonna try

2530.44 --> 2535.48
to force it on people like they liberals

2533.02 --> 2537.46
out there that have been kind of like

2535.48 --> 2540.18
let it all happen like they don't want

2537.46 --> 2540.18
that [ __ ] either

2541.839 --> 2546.7
right there's I mean

2544.18 --> 2549.339
there's plenty of one of the typical

2546.7 --> 2553.54
traits of liberals the actual liberals

2549.339 --> 2556.839
rash root not in system liberals is that

2553.54 --> 2559.359
they're very oppositionally defiant and

2556.839 --> 2561.88
like they don't

2559.359 --> 2564.7
let the system dictate [ __ ] to them

2561.88 --> 2567.52
that's how they became liberals it's

2564.7 --> 2570.46
like no I disagree with that

2567.52 --> 2572.619
it's like yeah but everybody in the

2570.46 --> 2574.839
world agrees with that and like no

2572.619 --> 2576.579
no I don't see it that way right that's

2574.839 --> 2578.619
kind of how it started in your Youth and

2576.579 --> 2581.04
all that right I know it this is how I

2578.619 --> 2581.04
started

2582.099 --> 2587.98
and they've been going along for a while

2584.98 --> 2591.16
now for this liberal dominance this

2587.98 --> 2595.0
system liberals keeping attack making

2591.16 --> 2598.1189999999997
the super right Wings lives really hard

2595.0 --> 2600.16
but they didn't stop there you didn't

2598.119 --> 2604.079
think about that they wouldn't stop they

2600.16 --> 2604.0789999999997
just keep picking in the next Target

2604.54 --> 2609.7
and you're already

2607.48 --> 2613.06
if you would be honest about everything

2609.7 --> 2616.54
you'd already be in the target range

2613.06 --> 2619.9
but you cooked a lot of you [ __ ] to try

2616.54 --> 2622.7799999999997
to pretend like you're like on that high

2619.9 --> 2625.54
level too so that you don't get targeted

2622.78 --> 2628.48
but the real you is definitely going to

2625.54 --> 2631.06
be a Target so you need to stop

2628.48 --> 2633.52
you need to stop pretending like you can

2631.06 --> 2635.619
ride that curve and not get targeted

2633.52 --> 2637.06
you're all going to be targeted it needs

2635.619 --> 2639.88
to stop

2637.06 --> 2642.819
you need to stop them from targeting

2639.88 --> 2644.5
everybody you should stop them when they

2642.819 --> 2646.7799999999997
started but you didn't you thought it

2644.5 --> 2649.079
was convenient now you're gonna have to

2646.78 --> 2649.079
fight

2649.599 --> 2653.26
and you're gonna have to

2651.64 --> 2656.56
defend

2653.26 --> 2661.0
your personal liberalism

2656.56 --> 2663.16
against this system liberal insanity

2661.0 --> 2665.26
and they are doing it and they're

2663.16 --> 2667.5989999999997
recognizing it like

2665.26 --> 2671.5600000000004
this crazy cult [ __ ] everywhere all this

2667.599 --> 2675.3590000000004
Marxist cult [ __ ] climate cults

2671.56 --> 2675.359
like medical cults

2675.52 --> 2682.06
like liberals too are realizing that

2679.54 --> 2684.099
even though they were originally kind of

2682.06 --> 2686.92
a fan of these types of things and

2684.099 --> 2689.02
thinking in that direction and

2686.92 --> 2692.079
old medical probably not a lot of

2689.02 --> 2695.2
hippies already always hate it big

2692.079 --> 2698.52
Pharma in that sense right

2695.2 --> 2698.52
also liberals

2698.98 --> 2705.88
but I mean the way things are going like

2703.119 --> 2708.819
we can't call them liberals anymore like

2705.88 --> 2711.28
the system liberals those marxists those

2708.819 --> 2714.7
puppets that's crazy

2711.28 --> 2717.3
drugged out crazy people they're not

2714.7 --> 2717.2999999999997
liberals

2721.839 --> 2727.18
or you gotta split it apart you gotta

2724.24 --> 2729.3999999999996
say they're not Grassroots liberals

2727.18 --> 2732.2799999999997
they're not actual people that just like

2729.4 --> 2735.3
I'm a liberal because of this and that

2732.28 --> 2735.3
when I was younger

2735.339 --> 2739.56
it's not that

2737.14 --> 2742.66
it's more like a cult it's more like

2739.56 --> 2745.9
indoctrination forced upon them

2742.66 --> 2747.8799999999997
Marxist mind control

2745.9 --> 2750.819
cultist

2747.88 --> 2752.619
and that's not liberal

2750.819 --> 2755.98
that's

2752.619 --> 2757.9
really just creepy I I didn't can you

2755.98 --> 2760.18
even politically

2757.9 --> 2763.0
designate such a thing

2760.18 --> 2764.98
right when it's just pure mind control

2763.0 --> 2767.74
slavery

2764.98 --> 2769.92
where is that on the spectrum of left or

2767.74 --> 2769.9199999999996
right

2770.26 --> 2775.7400000000002
I don't know

2772.06 --> 2778.18
but it's out of control and even like

2775.74 --> 2781.8999999999996
liberal-minded people they should know

2778.18 --> 2785.14
that this cannot continue

2781.9 --> 2787.78
you cannot seriously continue

2785.14 --> 2789.5789999999997
just because for example you like to be

2787.78 --> 2792.2200000000003
vegan you feel really good about that

2789.579 --> 2794.8
and probably has some health benefits if

2792.22 --> 2797.02
you do it well and all that right

2794.8 --> 2798.579
although it might not last forever you

2797.02 --> 2800.56
might have an exception here and there

2798.579 --> 2804.819
for a good reason and listen to your

2800.56 --> 2806.619
body listen to your body it knows best

2804.819 --> 2808.839
right

2806.619 --> 2811.54
but

2808.839 --> 2813.819
you should not go along with basically

2811.54 --> 2815.56
the government attack

2813.819 --> 2818.98
of farms

2815.56 --> 2823.98
and of meat consumption like you should

2818.98 --> 2823.98
know that that is really bad

2825.04 --> 2831.54
right

2826.48 --> 2831.54
you can't force people with their diets

2832.14 --> 2838.72
like it's not properly liberal to force

2835.599 --> 2841.06
people into anything right that's the

2838.72 --> 2843.3999999999996
whole point of real liberalism is that

2841.06 --> 2846.819
people should have the free choice

2843.4 --> 2849.64
to live their lives as they see fit as

2846.819 --> 2852.06
long as it doesn't harm another human

2849.64 --> 2852.06
being

2853.48 --> 2858.88
yeah that's how it works that the

2856.18 --> 2862.14
constitution the most countries that's

2858.88 --> 2862.1400000000003
the basic law system

2862.72 --> 2865.72
foreign

2867.46 --> 2872.5
anyway

2869.859 --> 2874.54
I think Liberals are gonna like really

2872.5 --> 2877.9
get sick more and more of this and

2874.54 --> 2880.66
they're gonna basically started the Old

2877.9 --> 2882.52
Hippie Revolution all over again before

2880.66 --> 2884.68
the the whole

2882.52 --> 2885.819
Woodstock [ __ ] started happening and all

2884.68 --> 2887.9199999999996
that

2885.819 --> 2890.319
they're gonna just come back it's gonna

2887.92 --> 2891.64
be the old liberals again that they try

2890.319 --> 2893.859
to bypass

2891.64 --> 2897.5789999999997
they're gonna just go up completely

2893.859 --> 2899.2599999999998
self-sufficient away from the system

2897.579 --> 2900.94
and then there's going to be a new

2899.26 --> 2904.599
hedonism

2900.94 --> 2908.02
Revolution through media

2904.599 --> 2910.44
and more space spectacles right just

2908.02 --> 2910.44
like then

2911.02 --> 2916.359
so history is repeating itself it is

2914.74 --> 2917.859
rhyming

2916.359 --> 2919.5989999999997
and the same things are going to happen

2917.859 --> 2923.02
the same groups are going to form the

2919.599 --> 2925.2400000000002
same type of responses Are Gonna Come

2923.02 --> 2928.78
we should expect that

2925.24 --> 2931.359
things go the same way

2928.78 --> 2935.1600000000003
all the time

2931.359 --> 2935.16
every Century pretty much

2936.4 --> 2944.2000000000003
because human responses are the same

2941.98 --> 2947.079
things happen

2944.2 --> 2949.7799999999997
and then the average average response

2947.079 --> 2952.54
from the people will be the same as the

2949.78 --> 2955.2400000000002
average response from the people that

2952.54 --> 2957.46
faced a very similar situation like that

2955.24 --> 2960.54
a hundred years ago

2957.46 --> 2960.54
same things happen

2964.66 --> 2972.96
real liberalism is dead no it isn't

2969.52 --> 2976.72
it isn't it's just been

2972.96 --> 2979.26
hijacked for a while

2976.72 --> 2982.2999999999997
the zombie has like

2979.26 --> 2983.8
Satan has been like I'm a liberal I'm a

2982.3 --> 2985.0600000000004
liberal and the Liberals were like oh

2983.8 --> 2987.819
yeah sure

2985.06 --> 2989.44
wow he's really powerful like oh because

2987.819 --> 2991.9
the world going to be liberal now this

2989.44 --> 2994.96
is awesome right that's what it was but

2991.9 --> 2996.76
now it's like you're taking it too far

2994.96 --> 3000.7400000000002
devil

2996.76 --> 3000.7400000000002
this isn't really liberal anymore

3000.9 --> 3005.96
you're just trying to enslave us again

3006.48 --> 3013.5
liberalism isn't dead it's just

3009.98 --> 3015.48
it's gonna like detach from the devil

3013.5 --> 3018.0
again

3015.48 --> 3021.119
and thus it's gonna turn back to that

3018.0 --> 3022.859
original hippie form where completely

3021.119 --> 3025.7400000000002
independent from government like make

3022.859 --> 3030.18
your own food have your own goats kind

3025.74 --> 3033.72
of like oh and Benjamin is actually like

3030.18 --> 3036.319
an original 60s liberal he's very I mean

3033.72 --> 3036.319
he is that

3036.78 --> 3042.8390000000004
right just yeah he doesn't have like

3040.079 --> 3044.76
long hair and [ __ ]

3042.839 --> 3046.38
but other than that it's like they're

3044.76 --> 3049.7400000000002
pretty much like a really

3046.38 --> 3052.079
self-sufficient hippie family

3049.74 --> 3055.9799999999996
really

3052.079 --> 3058.1400000000003
they just don't have the looks of that

3055.98 --> 3060.059
but they're self-sufficient they're

3058.14 --> 3063.54
really anti-government

3060.059 --> 3066.1800000000003
right they're like Community oriented

3063.54 --> 3070.74
that's that's like the old hippies from

3066.18 --> 3073.5
the 60s before the CIA started to insert

3070.74 --> 3077.22
drugs and Hedonism and

3073.5 --> 3080.16
and free sex and and all that in there

3077.22 --> 3082.319
so the same thing is happening again an

3080.16 --> 3087.0789999999997
Owen Benjamin is like one of those old

3082.319 --> 3087.079
hippies before the Woodstock happened

3088.26 --> 3091.579
see how time is

3091.859 --> 3096.419
just repeating itself

3093.32 --> 3096.4190000000003
[Music]

3096.66 --> 3102.2599999999998
right and even this very understanding

3099.42 --> 3107.2200000000003
that the feel for it

3102.26 --> 3108.599
is effectively that is unique Yeah a

3107.22 --> 3110.64
hundred years ago there would have been

3108.599 --> 3113.2200000000003
very few people that would have had this

3110.64 --> 3114.7799999999997
feeling like I am having now brutal

3113.22 --> 3117.839
Steiner would have definitely been one

3114.78 --> 3119.46
of them it would feel like this is how

3117.839 --> 3121.0789999999997
it works this is what's happening this

3119.46 --> 3123.66
is how it's an echo of the previous

3121.079 --> 3126.059
century

3123.66 --> 3127.7999999999997
but there was no internet there was no

3126.059 --> 3130.7400000000002
oh I'm just gonna publicly broadcast

3127.8 --> 3132.0
that everybody can see that now yeah oh

3130.74 --> 3133.3799999999997
everybody's going to talk about no no

3132.0 --> 3135.96
that wasn't there

3133.38 --> 3141.3
so there is definitely

3135.96 --> 3143.52
a unique dialectic acceleration

3141.3 --> 3145.5
right now

3143.52 --> 3148.099
huh

3145.5 --> 3150.319
new insights that are very high tier

3148.099 --> 3154.26
have a much

3150.319 --> 3156.9
higher spread reach

3154.26 --> 3159.8390000000004
than a hundred years ago and that

3156.9 --> 3163.619
effectively causes the exposure to

3159.839 --> 3167.24
really high level insights causes a

3163.619 --> 3167.2400000000002
dialectic acceleration

3167.88 --> 3172.92
the liberal libertarian

3170.88 --> 3175.859
yeah it's actually kind of the same

3172.92 --> 3178.6800000000003
thing diaper and then maybe that

3175.859 --> 3180.2
it's just that

3178.68 --> 3183.2999999999997
eventually

3180.2 --> 3186.24
Libertarians started to like

3183.3 --> 3189.1800000000003
separate them libertarian is like the

3186.24 --> 3190.5589999999997
first political separation between old

3189.18 --> 3193.2
liberalism

3190.559 --> 3196.079
like from the 20th century liberalism

3193.2 --> 3197.7599999999998
right libertarian came because that it

3196.079 --> 3199.6800000000003
was being noticed that liberals were

3197.76 --> 3202.4
getting more communist and more

3199.68 --> 3202.3999999999996
extremists

3202.559 --> 3210.0
and people still hung in there

3206.819 --> 3212.18
but libertarian is its own weird issues

3210.0 --> 3212.18
now

3212.22 --> 3218.5989999999997
it's different but it has its own it

3214.859 --> 3218.5989999999997
basically has the same problems

3219.38 --> 3224.0
so I don't really see them all that

3221.76 --> 3224.0
different

3224.52 --> 3228.68
foreign

3225.619 --> 3231.2400000000002
it's just that liberalism has been

3228.68 --> 3235.5
turned into communism but if you just

3231.24 --> 3238.2599999999998
take old liberalism like typical 20th

3235.5 --> 3240.78
century liberalism

3238.26 --> 3244.38
then

3240.78 --> 3246.8390000000004
that's really what libertarianism is or

3244.38 --> 3248.339
what they try to make it

3246.839 --> 3250.0789999999997
right

3248.339 --> 3251.16
it's just more detailed more thought

3250.079 --> 3253.7400000000002
through

3251.16 --> 3256.02
more systematic

3253.74 --> 3259.319
more decentralized that sort of thing

3256.02 --> 3263.0
but it is basically what liberalism was

3259.319 --> 3263.0
so it's the same thing

3263.28 --> 3268.8
in my opinion it's just

3266.099 --> 3271.2000000000003
when things get diluted and corrupted

3268.8 --> 3275.1600000000003
well then something within there is

3271.2 --> 3277.74
gonna separate and be a new thing that's

3275.16 --> 3280.14
basically the old thing before it

3277.74 --> 3281.16
corrupted and that's what libertarianism

3280.14 --> 3284.0589999999997
is

3281.16 --> 3284.0589999999997
in my view

3289.859 --> 3292.46
anyway

3300.9 --> 3306.359
my hardcore maybe liberal friends are

3304.079 --> 3308.28
psychology gone what does that mean

3306.359 --> 3311.46
psychology gum

3308.28 --> 3313.5
you mean psychologically done

3311.46 --> 3317.339
they're out of their minds

3313.5 --> 3319.74
if like lost their mind

3317.339 --> 3322.94
that is tragic

3319.74 --> 3322.9399999999996
anyway cheers

3338.04 --> 3343.319
right but as part of the dialectic

3340.92 --> 3349.099
acceleration

3343.319 --> 3349.099
what really isn't doing that is that now

3349.38 --> 3355.559
what was really secretive

3352.44 --> 3357.599
social engineering research knowledge in

3355.559 --> 3362.2200000000003
like the

3357.599 --> 3365.76
early 20th century late 19th century

3362.22 --> 3367.3799999999997
it was really obscure as in nobody knew

3365.76 --> 3369.059
about it and the people that were

3367.38 --> 3370.859
dealing with that they kept it secret

3369.059 --> 3373.88
because they knew it could be dangerous

3370.859 --> 3377.22
if other people saw that

3373.88 --> 3380.2200000000003
now that same knowledge which is still

3377.22 --> 3382.7
effective it still works it's basically

3380.22 --> 3385.6189999999997
scientific You could argue

3382.7 --> 3387.839
they had actually made tests with that

3385.619 --> 3389.6400000000003
Pavlov all that

3387.839 --> 3392.4
right

3389.64 --> 3395.22
that stuff is now common law it's being

3392.4 --> 3396.96
spread as common law as in people that

3395.22 --> 3399.72
are like oh well let's see what's on the

3396.96 --> 3402.42
radio can turn it on

3399.72 --> 3405.5989999999997
or like internet radio and just like

3402.42 --> 3407.7000000000003
hear knowledge that was super secretive

3405.599 --> 3414.0
super high level

3407.7 --> 3416.3999999999996
develop Knowledge from say 150 years ago

3414.0 --> 3419.16
and is commonly spread among people that

3416.4 --> 3422.04
weren't even really necessarily looking

3419.16 --> 3424.3799999999997
for knowledge at that level right and

3422.04 --> 3426.8
that's the weird dichotomy now is that

3424.38 --> 3431.099
we have this

3426.8 --> 3433.2000000000003
extreme Peak knowledge range available

3431.099 --> 3435.78
to us

3433.2 --> 3437.22
but people are kind of disoriented

3435.78 --> 3439.2000000000003
within it

3437.22 --> 3441.18
because there's basically more knowledge

3439.2 --> 3443.54
available than most people know how to

3441.18 --> 3443.54
deal with

3443.7 --> 3449.339
like we get all the knowledge we don't

3445.859 --> 3452.16
really get taught how to deal with

3449.339 --> 3454.68
having all that knowledge

3452.16 --> 3457.3799999999997
now do we

3454.68 --> 3459.18
nobody ever taught us like how did how

3457.38 --> 3461.339
do you deal with enormous amounts of

3459.18 --> 3464.64
knowledge that wasn't there before

3461.339 --> 3466.5
oh it's just an opportunity you can just

3464.64 --> 3469.0789999999997
do whatever you want yeah that's that's

3466.5 --> 3471.3
what the devil says yeah but how do you

3469.079 --> 3472.98
actually deal with all that

3471.3 --> 3474.1800000000003
what are you supposed to do with it

3472.98 --> 3476.52
really

3474.18 --> 3478.68
not how can you be an opportunist or

3476.52 --> 3481.619
like a corporate stooge and just focus

3478.68 --> 3483.0
on something to get something what are

3481.619 --> 3485.48
you supposed to do with all this

3483.0 --> 3485.48
knowledge

3486.24 --> 3491.4599999999996
how would you advise a new person that's

3489.42 --> 3493.8
never really that's like a kid and going

3491.46 --> 3495.96
on the internet how would you truly

3493.8 --> 3499.1400000000003
prepare them

3495.96 --> 3501.7400000000002
for what is available out there

3499.14 --> 3501.74
you know

3505.44 --> 3508.7400000000002
you Google difference between liberal

3507.359 --> 3513.119
libertarian

3508.74 --> 3515.9399999999996
very interesting okay what was it

3513.119 --> 3518.119
diver than Navy vet tell me what's the

3515.94 --> 3518.119
difference

3526.619 --> 3529.94
was I right or what

3543.96 --> 3548.28
too much to fit into okay

3551.4 --> 3556.98
so there is a lot of differences

3554.7 --> 3558.96
or there's just a lot of similarities

3556.98 --> 3560.41
like what I'm what are we talking about

3558.96 --> 3563.679
here

3560.41 --> 3563.6789999999996
[Music]

3573.14 --> 3578.819
by the way how amazing would it be

3576.96 --> 3581.46
if Google

3578.819 --> 3585.18
could actually do search results that

3581.46 --> 3587.76
were like time based as well like

3585.18 --> 3591.3799999999997
what would the result be for a search

3587.76 --> 3594.5400000000004
what is the difference between

3591.38 --> 3597.359
liberalism and libertarianism

3594.54 --> 3601.5
in 1990

3597.359 --> 3604.14
so that any gathered data

3601.5 --> 3607.559
that would have been used to give you

3604.14 --> 3611.7
the conclusion cannot be taken from

3607.559 --> 3614.8190000000004
information that came after 1990.

3611.7 --> 3617.22
and then see what it actually says how

3614.819 --> 3619.74
fascinating would it be if that was a

3617.22 --> 3621.9599999999996
and a thing that you can do

3619.74 --> 3623.7
because then you can ask like yeah what

3621.96 --> 3627.119
is the difference between this and that

3623.7 --> 3630.0
now this and that okay makes sense that

3627.119 --> 3632.94
is kind of what it seems like yeah now

3630.0 --> 3634.92
what is it like 50 years ago and then

3632.94 --> 3637.819
you get a completely different rollout

3634.92 --> 3642.54
and it's like what

3637.819 --> 3644.52
isn't that we know that that happens

3642.54 --> 3647.52
how cool would it be if you could like

3644.52 --> 3648.54
do a result search result and then have

3647.52 --> 3652.319
like

3648.54 --> 3654.42
a spectrum of time on top of that so

3652.319 --> 3656.22
this is the result right now this is

3654.42 --> 3658.5
what it was 10 years ago this is what 20

3656.22 --> 3661.7599999999998
years 30 years 40 years that you can

3658.5 --> 3667.04
have like a a Time

3661.76 --> 3667.0400000000004
slider on your results

3670.26 --> 3674.9
I think that would actually be doable

3674.94 --> 3679.26
people

3676.2 --> 3681.48
it's like a filter

3679.26 --> 3683.76
but instead of like publishing date

3681.48 --> 3687.119
which is what those types of filters are

3683.76 --> 3691.3900000000003
usually used for you could have like

3687.119 --> 3693.359
direct input filter like time

3691.39 --> 3697.0789999999997
[Music]

3693.359 --> 3699.839
limited input

3697.079 --> 3701.3390000000004
that the input has to be derived from a

3699.839 --> 3704.839
certain date

3701.339 --> 3704.839
and not after that

3706.559 --> 3712.57
okay anyway

3708.09 --> 3712.57
[Music]

3714.72 --> 3718.9399999999996
some similarities lots of differences

3724.92 --> 3730.2200000000003
that's not very clarifying but uh

3753.78 --> 3760.4
almost but not quite energy in your

3756.66 --> 3760.3999999999996
opinion yeah yeah

3761.64 --> 3764.5989999999997
well they try

3767.88 --> 3773.0
right but that is kind of sort of what

3770.099 --> 3773.0
it was it's like

3773.16 --> 3777.0589999999997
in between Anarchy

3777.48 --> 3785.059
liberalism and conservatism

3781.2 --> 3785.0589999999997
it's like in between all of that

3795.96 --> 3801.079
but that's also why it's basically it's

3798.18 --> 3801.0789999999997
not really gonna work

3810.72 --> 3816.24
by the way conservatism it doesn't

3813.42 --> 3819.2400000000002
really exist anymore

3816.24 --> 3821.0989999999997
original conservatism it's become a

3819.24 --> 3823.2599999999998
mockery

3821.099 --> 3826.92
a mask

3823.26 --> 3829.38
of its former self I mean

3826.92 --> 3831.78
look at conservatism out there it's

3829.38 --> 3834.599
literally just posturism it's all

3831.78 --> 3837.119
poser-ish there's no cons there's act no

3834.599 --> 3839.3590000000004
actual conservative conservatism not

3837.119 --> 3839.359
really

3843.96 --> 3849.78
just look who's representing you man

3847.38 --> 3852.9
look at what they're like they're all a

3849.78 --> 3856.559
bunch of Pretender clowns

3852.9 --> 3859.6800000000003
and I get to see a lot of it like

3856.559 --> 3862.079
through Alex Jones media they shove it

3859.68 --> 3866.0589999999997
in your face a lot but seriously they're

3862.079 --> 3866.059
all a bunch of Pretender clouds

3875.88 --> 3880.559
like they don't even know how to be

3878.46 --> 3883.5
conservative anymore

3880.559 --> 3885.78
it's like they can't do it

3883.5 --> 3888.24
they can only pretend to be like that

3885.78 --> 3890.48
they can't actually do it none of them

3888.24 --> 3890.4799999999996
can

3890.7 --> 3896.66
or is this maybe I'm just imagining this

3894.0 --> 3896.66
I don't know

3902.839 --> 3908.099
it's just that when I think of like

3905.94 --> 3911.4
American politics or whatever I can't

3908.099 --> 3913.44
think of a single person

3911.4 --> 3916.319
that I remember

3913.44 --> 3920.599
that is actually conservative

3916.319 --> 3920.599
and not just pretending to be that

3932.52 --> 3934.94
okay

3936.36 --> 3940.26
[Music]

3938.04 --> 3942.0
and by the way the same the same goes

3940.26 --> 3944.46
for freaking liberals I mean all those

3942.0 --> 3946.74
liberals in the Democratic party and all

3944.46 --> 3948.299
that they're all just virtual signaling

3946.74 --> 3951.66
pretending like they're liberals with

3948.299 --> 3954.2599999999998
their hardcore communist autocrats

3951.66 --> 3954.2599999999998
totally

3958.38 --> 3961.6800000000003
I mean actual Liberals are they don't

3960.359 --> 3964.319
get power

3961.68 --> 3967.16
in that system they don't they never get

3964.319 --> 3967.16
power

3970.559 --> 3975.7200000000003
like the only place where an actual

3972.96 --> 3977.64
Grassroots liberal could probably get

3975.72 --> 3980.16
power in government would be through the

3977.64 --> 3983.7599999999998
conservative party ironically

3980.16 --> 3986.64
I'm I'm not even joking and that's why

3983.76 --> 3987.78
we see freaking Trump there

3986.64 --> 3991.2
right

3987.78 --> 3993.6800000000003
because Trump is a liberal like an old

3991.2 --> 3993.68
liberal

3994.22 --> 4000.5589999999997
he also by the way is very well

3997.559 --> 4000.559
entangled

4000.74 --> 4005.66
so he is definitely a system guy I do

4003.68 --> 4008.5989999999997
feel that despite everything

4005.66 --> 4012.0989999999997
but you could argue that well maybe for

4008.599 --> 4014.6600000000003
a system guys probably like

4012.099 --> 4016.6400000000003
uniquely better than the rest of the

4014.66 --> 4019.2799999999997
system but it's like a system guy can

4016.64 --> 4022.64
never break the system you see

4019.28 --> 4024.3190000000004
that's the myth behind it

4022.64 --> 4026.9
there was this myth like he was going to

4024.319 --> 4029.18
break the system he can't he is part of

4026.9 --> 4032.2400000000002
the system but he is like

4029.18 --> 4035.299
one of the nicer players in the system

4032.24 --> 4037.4199999999996
maybe it's all a matter of perspective I

4035.299 --> 4037.42
guess

4042.039 --> 4050.079
actor of the system yeah a bit

4046.4 --> 4050.079
he does do things though

4051.68 --> 4058.0989999999997
and he's a good player

4053.839 --> 4062.38
I mean he he is really good with taming

4058.099 --> 4062.38
the Sheep he really is great at that

4063.619 --> 4069.6800000000003
I mean it's this sounds silly but even I

4067.099 --> 4071.78
kind of enjoy like seeing him do

4069.68 --> 4073.3999999999996
speeches at rallies

4071.78 --> 4076.3390000000004
that's weird

4073.4 --> 4080.119
I know but he's just

4076.339 --> 4082.5389999999998
good at it sort of

4080.119 --> 4085.4
it just sucks when he starts to like

4082.539 --> 4087.5
deny [ __ ]

4085.4 --> 4092.079
that's when that magic is lost but

4087.5 --> 4092.079
overall he's just like good at it

4100.16 --> 4107.179
right but yeah whatever Trump's gonna do

4103.64 --> 4110.179
he might sort of like hold off the

4107.179 --> 4111.62
burning out of the country and all that

4110.179 --> 4114.62
but

4111.62 --> 4119.0199999999995
is definitely not gonna really break the

4114.62 --> 4119.0199999999995
system because he is the system

4120.62 --> 4124.58
so the best you could expect to get out

4122.839 --> 4128.719
of him if he really gained full control

4124.58 --> 4131.6
is that he would uproot a couple of key

4128.719 --> 4135.1
deep straight players and replace them

4131.6 --> 4135.1
with other deep State players

4135.56 --> 4140.839000000001
and then make it seem like the Deep

4138.679 --> 4143.66
State agenda has been available and then

4140.839 --> 4145.2789999999995
like kind of like slowly restarted again

4143.66 --> 4146.96
really careful

4145.279 --> 4149.6
right

4146.96 --> 4152.799
that's the best you could expect to get

4149.6 --> 4156.819
out of trump presidency and it's really

4152.799 --> 4156.819
more than you probably would get

4157.759 --> 4164.199
because he is assistant guy he can't

4159.739 --> 4164.199
stop the system because he's part of it

4166.759 --> 4172.699
but he can play it like it is a reset

4170.299 --> 4175.64
like oh we're we're getting them all the

4172.699 --> 4178.16
Deep say we got them we got him now we

4175.64 --> 4179.4800000000005
can move on with the new America and the

4178.16 --> 4181.339
Deep State's still going to be there

4179.48 --> 4184.12
it's just like now they're gonna have to

4181.339 --> 4186.62
like sneak back to the controls again

4184.12 --> 4190.96
America thinks that they won right

4186.62 --> 4190.96
that's the best you could get out of it

4193.1 --> 4195.58
foreign

4198.28 --> 4202.719
yeah the Q movement is garbage

4203.84 --> 4208.0
is better than Trump what

4211.4 --> 4215.48
one is better okay

4216.86 --> 4223.0599999999995
I don't know what the hell Elon is I

4219.44 --> 4223.0599999999995
find him a very weird actor

4226.76 --> 4231.320000000001
all I know is that with everything

4228.92 --> 4234.52
that's happened I'm starting to trust

4231.32 --> 4234.5199999999995
him less and less

4241.219 --> 4246.5
they just seem to be acting erratic I

4244.04 --> 4249.56
mean there's like they grafted in

4246.5 --> 4251.06
popularism like say certain things that

4249.56 --> 4253.400000000001
are really popular

4251.06 --> 4255.820000000001
but it doesn't really show in their

4253.4 --> 4255.82
actions

4259.4 --> 4266.86
it just feels like it's the system

4262.04 --> 4266.86
trying to pretend to oppose the system

4283.94 --> 4288.5
okay he knows that's okay turret well

4287.12 --> 4292.58
that's very cool

4288.5 --> 4297.38
uh that's a bit hopeful but I mean look

4292.58 --> 4300.14
if Elon could be caught on camera

4297.38 --> 4303.02
official not just on the street or

4300.14 --> 4305.6
whatever actually having an elaborate

4303.02 --> 4308.06
discussion about Flat Earth

4305.6 --> 4311.0
and about how space is fake and all that

4308.06 --> 4313.9400000000005
and he would basically come out and say

4311.0 --> 4317.0
something like yeah we kind of know that

4313.94 --> 4319.159
NASA stuff is fake but like I'm still

4317.0 --> 4320.6
curious to find out what's really up

4319.159 --> 4322.04
there

4320.6 --> 4325.820000000001
right

4322.04 --> 4327.679
if if that would happen that's something

4325.82 --> 4330.0199999999995
else right because then there's

4327.679 --> 4331.6990000000005
basically a break with the act it would

4330.02 --> 4333.860000000001
absolutely be compartmentalized I mean

4331.699 --> 4335.0599999999995
any person after that that would see

4333.86 --> 4337.82
that

4335.06 --> 4340.52
would immediately like forget about it

4337.82 --> 4342.44
and that video would never be played on

4340.52 --> 4344.360000000001
Alex it would break everything you see

4342.44 --> 4346.699
and they would definitely forgive him

4344.36 --> 4348.92
for mentioning those things

4346.699 --> 4350.719
they just never be brought into the

4348.92 --> 4352.82
attention except through Flat Earth

4350.719 --> 4355.88
would spread in here but it would never

4352.82 --> 4359.199
see it you would never see it on

4355.88 --> 4359.1990000000005
sub mainstream media

4359.54 --> 4366.0199999999995
but if it actually be caught on cameras

4363.56 --> 4368.860000000001
talking like that well then you got my

4366.02 --> 4368.860000000001
attention Terry

4369.199 --> 4374.599999999999
then I might go with okay well maybe

4372.679 --> 4377.36
it's this weird

4374.6 --> 4380.9800000000005
free actor out there

4377.36 --> 4380.98
but I really doubt he is

4385.1 --> 4390.679
I think head of SpaceX doesn't know flat

4388.159 --> 4393.099999999999
no why would he why would he have to

4390.679 --> 4393.1
know that

4408.86 --> 4416.299999999999
yeah it could be a controlled Bluff like

4414.199 --> 4418.46
as a corporate

4416.3 --> 4420.9800000000005
plan like

4418.46 --> 4423.02
yeah we're gonna pretend like we're

4420.98 --> 4425.718999999999
gonna go to space we don't actually know

4423.02 --> 4427.76
how to go to space yet and nobody

4425.719 --> 4429.32
actually knows that everybody just keeps

4427.76 --> 4432.08
pretending like they know and that's

4429.32 --> 4434.9
kind of like it works it's very popular

4432.08 --> 4437.0599999999995
so we're gonna just pretend like we're

4434.9 --> 4438.44
gonna go to space and maybe we could

4437.06 --> 4440.06
figure out

4438.44 --> 4441.44
more

4440.06 --> 4443.4800000000005
right

4441.44 --> 4447.219
while we do that

4443.48 --> 4447.218999999999
and that could be the business plan

4448.98 --> 4452.08
[Music]

4456.14 --> 4461.3
okay terrible I'm glad you know all

4458.96 --> 4463.4
these things exactly I I didn't know you

4461.3 --> 4465.14
had this back door in people's heads so

4463.4 --> 4467.679
you could know that with absolute

4465.14 --> 4467.679
certainty

4480.679 --> 4487.06
but I mean yeah

4483.32 --> 4487.0599999999995
I'm going to assume that

4487.1 --> 4491.54
Elon Musk also knows that the Earth is

4489.679 --> 4494.3
flat

4491.54 --> 4497.3
or at least has a strong suspicion but I

4494.3 --> 4499.88
think all of you out there and you tear

4497.3 --> 4501.8
it flat earthers in general you highly

4499.88 --> 4504.38
overestimate

4501.8 --> 4508.1
how much knowledge these peoples

4504.38 --> 4510.4400000000005
including the billionaires actually have

4508.1 --> 4513.08
it's like in your mind you'll think like

4510.44 --> 4517.219
oh they have this much money so they

4513.08 --> 4518.239
have to know these things wrong not at

4517.219 --> 4520.699
all

4518.239 --> 4522.44
you'll find that the more money people

4520.699 --> 4525.28
have the more [ __ ] they actually

4522.44 --> 4525.28
turn out to be

4526.0 --> 4531.08
not even joking

4528.739 --> 4533.239
people that have a lot of money just

4531.08 --> 4535.94
know how to make a lot of money

4533.239 --> 4538.04
that is all they don't know other things

4535.94 --> 4540.98
most of the time because they don't have

4538.04 --> 4543.98
room in their head to know other things

4540.98 --> 4547.58
unless things just torture them and make

4543.98 --> 4551.0599999999995
them forced to sacrifice things that

4547.58 --> 4552.62
they now know about to get more money so

4551.06 --> 4555.56
they don't

4552.62 --> 4558.94
want to know more things they just want

4555.56 --> 4558.9400000000005
to know how to get more money

4559.34 --> 4564.28
and they want the knowledge to get to

4561.98 --> 4564.28
that

4564.8 --> 4571.400000000001
so they'll learn things

4567.219 --> 4573.44
just to know how to make more money and

4571.4 --> 4576.08
then not really understand what they

4573.44 --> 4578.239
learned they just know how to use it

4576.08 --> 4580.699
and that's how a lot of these Super Rich

4578.239 --> 4583.159
do things they don't really understand

4580.699 --> 4586.419999999999
what they're doing they're just learning

4583.159 --> 4586.42

4605.7 --> 4610.699
[Music]

4608.659 --> 4612.739
I was actually yeah well tear it just

4610.699 --> 4615.139999999999
because they actively fake stuff that

4612.739 --> 4617.12
doesn't mean that they know

4615.14 --> 4620.96
it's all fake

4617.12 --> 4623.12
the person fakes a rocket launch well

4620.96 --> 4624.7390000000005
then they know how to fake a rocket

4623.12 --> 4628.78
launch that doesn't mean that they know

4624.739 --> 4628.78
whether the Earth is flat or a sphere

4630.199 --> 4637.4
that's not inherent

4633.62 --> 4638.659
like I can definitely imagine being a

4637.4 --> 4642.08
baller

4638.659 --> 4645.379999999999
and then figuring out how to fool the

4642.08 --> 4646.94
public in believing that I launched a

4645.38 --> 4651.28
rocket into space

4646.94 --> 4651.28
actually believing the Earth is a ball

4653.6 --> 4660.08
yeah you can do like oh look the Rockets

4656.3 --> 4662.54
going around the curve into the distance

4660.08 --> 4664.58
and then still believe that the rocket

4662.54 --> 4667.46
yeah it's going around the curve but in

4664.58 --> 4669.44
reality on the ball it's going around

4667.46 --> 4671.36
the curve a little bit too much and then

4669.44 --> 4674.0
it dives into the ocean

4671.36 --> 4677.44
right it can still be a ball in my mind

4674.0 --> 4677.44
when I plan that out

4684.159 --> 4691.78
a turret it's just annoying you just

4688.159 --> 4695.62
assume that everybody knows

4691.78 --> 4695.62
you're just assuming it

4696.199 --> 4701.0599999999995
because you apparently can't imagine

4698.48 --> 4705.759999999999
them not knowing because you know which

4701.06 --> 4705.76
is very poor imagination skills there it

4714.32 --> 4718.82
and

4715.96 --> 4720.26
yeah lunch through the sun yeah that's

4718.82 --> 4721.58
just weird

4720.26 --> 4723.02
I don't know what the hell they're

4721.58 --> 4730.189
thinking there

4723.02 --> 4730.189
[Music]

4731.6 --> 4736.900000000001
ISRO Chief knows he's doing a fraud or

4734.719 --> 4736.9
not

4741.32 --> 4747.98
Maybe

4743.6 --> 4749.659000000001
I don't know does he is he the one that

4747.98 --> 4752.178999999999
literally is in the know of everything

4749.659 --> 4754.639999999999
and how everything is tricked or is he

4752.179 --> 4758.54
assigned at the head

4754.64 --> 4761.0
and there are people that work for him

4758.54 --> 4763.04
we gives instructions but the people

4761.0 --> 4765.739
that are actually in the know and not

4763.04 --> 4768.679
the head they then

4765.739 --> 4770.239
translate those instructions into okay

4768.679 --> 4772.04
that means we're gonna have to trick

4770.239 --> 4775.639999999999
this and that

4772.04 --> 4777.86
so that the head would actually believe

4775.64 --> 4780.4400000000005
is real

4777.86 --> 4783.08
and his servants

4780.44 --> 4786.44
actually are the ones in the know and

4783.08 --> 4790.34
that set up the tricks to fool the head

4786.44 --> 4792.199
yeah that can be that is definitely

4790.34 --> 4794.3
possible when you're dealing with a

4792.199 --> 4797.44
bigger organization like that with

4794.3 --> 4797.4400000000005
multiple people involved

4800.78 --> 4807.0199999999995
so no they don't need to be in the know

4805.34 --> 4808.6990000000005
somebody has to be in the know it

4807.02 --> 4811.120000000001
doesn't have to be the guy in the

4808.699 --> 4811.12
spotlight

4815.36 --> 4819.98
the guy in the spotlight is just there

4817.76 --> 4821.659000000001
to be in the spotlight and pretend like

4819.98 --> 4823.759999999999
it's all real

4821.659 --> 4826.219
well how do you pretend it's all real

4823.76 --> 4827.360000000001
the best well by actually believing it's

4826.219 --> 4830.06
real

4827.36 --> 4833.0
so to make the act more real he wouldn't

4830.06 --> 4833.900000000001
have to be in the know that it's not

4833.0 --> 4836.78
real

4833.9 --> 4839.299999999999
the people he hands the instructions to

4836.78 --> 4843.0199999999995
how to do things would have to know it's

4839.3 --> 4846.38
not real so that they could actually

4843.02 --> 4849.02
engage with the trickery without the

4846.38 --> 4853.2390000000005
leader knowing it

4849.02 --> 4853.2390000000005

everybody believes it's a globe in the

Globe faith is dying

4878.78 --> 4883.5199999999995
people are definitely figuring out

4881.36 --> 4886.099999999999
faster than ever before that the Earth

4883.52 --> 4888.679
is flat

4886.1 --> 4892.219
measurably

these Trails being dumped I don't know

4929.48 --> 4931.839999999999
why

4932.54 --> 4936.219
don't show me that sky

4936.98 --> 4941.86

boss today guys a politician what

4960.44 --> 4964.58
that's fairly coherent sentence there

4962.78 --> 4969.0199999999995
tarot but

4964.58 --> 4971.84
I guess that the new NASA guy boss is

4969.02 --> 4974.42
really like a politician

4971.84 --> 4976.159000000001
well then they're probably like a

4974.42 --> 4978.34
Satanist and then they will be in the

4976.159 --> 4978.339999999999
now

4990.679 --> 4996.1990000000005
because those like political types that

4993.739 --> 4998.659
are like the ones that go to conferences

4996.199 --> 5001.0599999999995
wef conferences in Bilderberg

4998.659 --> 5004.839999999999
conferences and that sort of [ __ ] those

5001.06 --> 5006.159000000001
people are in now they are definitely in

5004.84 --> 5008.56
the know like

5006.159 --> 5011.379999999999
because otherwise it makes no sense for

5008.56 --> 5014.5
them to be at those conferences

5011.38 --> 5016.54
only people that are in the know go to

5014.5 --> 5019.96
those conferences

5016.54 --> 5021.219
and if you didn't no well then you will

5019.96 --> 5024.159
know

5021.219 --> 5028.2390000000005
because they don't pretend

5024.159 --> 5032.04
talk at those conferences they get to

they are in the know tarot 306 he knows

5067.78 --> 5073.9
he knows they are in the know

can you stop talking about it now

5088.12 --> 5092.199
yeah

5089.86 --> 5094.48
like write a book about it or something

5092.199 --> 5097.239
if you're so damn confident that you

5094.48 --> 5099.099999999999
know that he knows write a book about it

5109.0 --> 5117.46
it can only guess

or you can prove that he knows by him

5117.46 --> 5126.82
showing writing on camera whatever

5122.219 --> 5130.5
proving he knows like confessing he

5126.82 --> 5130.5

are you talking about

5186.88 --> 5191.46
where's those 50 names on my platform

5203.02 --> 5208.540000000001
of course it's a guess good we're glad

5205.3 --> 5212.400000000001
you you now you said that so you can

5208.54 --> 5212.4
stop about it you don't know

5212.92 --> 5217.679
stop trying to indoctrinate us with your

you're saying you're saying flat

earthers on every Fe play what the [ __ ]

5228.639 --> 5231.900000000001
is an Fe platform

5233.92 --> 5242.28
you mean social media platform

5238.0 --> 5242.28
what the [ __ ] is an Fe platform

5250.42 --> 5255.34
they have had insiders talk just like

5253.179 --> 5257.26
yeah yeah just because they have

5255.34 --> 5259.78
insiders talk doesn't mean that

5257.26 --> 5262.900000000001
everybody that was in there understood

5259.78 --> 5264.699
that or heard that or figured it out

5262.9 --> 5267.879999999999
there at 306

5264.699 --> 5269.739
yeah some of them will figure it out and

5267.88 --> 5271.179
not say anything because they don't want

5269.739 --> 5274.48
to lose their check

5271.179 --> 5275.38
others will figure it out freak out get

5274.48 --> 5278.08
out

5275.38 --> 5280.42
try to leak it perhaps

5278.08 --> 5282.28
and that doesn't mean that they all know

5280.42 --> 5283.84
there will be in there that will be just

5282.28 --> 5285.639
like no I'm just doing work I don't want

5283.84 --> 5288.34
to even see what happens to these people

5285.639 --> 5290.86
I just do what I'm told to do

5288.34 --> 5294.82
and I get the check

5290.86 --> 5296.92
and like they don't care basically it's

5294.82 --> 5298.48
like we don't care if it turns out they

5296.92 --> 5300.4
all die we're just following the

5298.48 --> 5304.919999999999
procedures and if they if you want that

5300.4 --> 5304.92
to stop well then change the procedures

5305.26 --> 5309.9400000000005
like there's doctors that are just very

5307.3 --> 5312.6
like neurotically procedural they don't

5309.94 --> 5312.599999999999
find out

5312.699 --> 5318.178999999999
they just do what the procedure says and

5315.82 --> 5318.179
that's it

5320.98 --> 5326.08
Flat Earth channels and surface yeah

5324.1 --> 5328.179
well hey Flat Earth channels you know

5326.08 --> 5330.699
you're gonna find

5328.179 --> 5332.86
the same flat earthers on Flat Earth

5330.699 --> 5335.62
channels because

5332.86 --> 5338.259999999999
those flatter channels were created by

5335.62 --> 5340.659
those people

5338.26 --> 5342.900000000001
I mean what did you expect here did you

5340.659 --> 5347.44
expect that there were going to be like

5342.9 --> 5348.638999999999
a thousand social media flat earthers

5347.44 --> 5350.98
that are going to be like super

5348.639 --> 5354.58
expansive and have their own

5350.98 --> 5356.739
clothing lines and mugs and

5354.58 --> 5358.84
like you really they're American there's

5356.739 --> 5360.82
just gonna be a thousand people that are

5358.84 --> 5363.159000000001
just I'm all we talk about is Flat Earth

5360.82 --> 5366.36
and merchandise like really

5363.159 --> 5366.36
is that what you expect

5366.639 --> 5369.36
I don't

5372.52 --> 5377.139
there's just a handful of people that

5375.1 --> 5379.4800000000005
are like that that are really going with

5377.139 --> 5381.88
the merchandise and all that [ __ ]

5379.48 --> 5385.659
and those are the same guys that did

5381.88 --> 5388.0
that very early on in 2015 and 16.

5385.659 --> 5390.179
started like the conferences and all

5388.0 --> 5390.179
that

5391.42 --> 5397.3
so yeah you're gonna find those

5394.08 --> 5399.82
everywhere because they stick out and

5397.3 --> 5402.900000000001
they advertise and they

5399.82 --> 5402.9
come and visit

5428.02 --> 5433.3
important players need to know the high

5430.42 --> 5436.36
grade truth I disagree Tara if an

5433.3 --> 5438.34
outsider designs a system and just tells

5436.36 --> 5442.12
everyone just follow the instructions

5438.34 --> 5444.1
that nobody executing the system would

5442.12 --> 5445.78
have to know about the system

5444.1 --> 5449.320000000001
they just need to follow the

5445.78 --> 5452.139
instructions so incorrect even a manager

5449.32 --> 5454.599999999999
wouldn't have to know what he is doing

5452.139 --> 5457.679
literally how it works you just have to

5454.6 --> 5457.679
follow the instructions

5465.0 --> 5471.219
right doesn't mean that he wouldn't be

5468.4 --> 5476.28
able to figure it out I'm just saying he

5471.219 --> 5476.28
wouldn't have to be in the know to do it

5478.87 --> 5481.989
[Music]

5482.219 --> 5487.6
but the Handler would have to be in

5485.26 --> 5490.179
another person assigning him there

5487.6 --> 5492.900000000001
definitely would have to be in the know

5490.179 --> 5492.9
you know

5500.139 --> 5506.6990000000005
Channels with 100K subs and let you what

5503.38 --> 5506.6990000000005
are you talking about turret

5509.56 --> 5514.0
who

5511.48 --> 5517.5599999999995
who the hell is the Flat Earth Channels

5514.0 --> 5517.56
with 100K Subs

5517.96 --> 5523.199
I only know a few and they've been

5520.3 --> 5523.1990000000005
around for a long time

5523.3 --> 5525.84
foreign

5562.36 --> 5570.5199999999995
oh wow super reliable

5565.48 --> 5570.5199999999995
awesome you think that's awesome why

5575.08 --> 5578.32
and who the [ __ ] is subscribing to him

5577.48 --> 5580.98
then

5578.32 --> 5580.98
why

5584.86 --> 5590.32
like how the [ __ ] is that even supposed

5587.62 --> 5593.739
to be logically possible when all of

5590.32 --> 5595.54
Flat Earth is gate kept how the hell are

5593.739 --> 5598.299999999999
you going to in a short period of time

5595.54 --> 5601.42
get 150k subs

5598.3 --> 5606.88
in in one and a half year

5601.42 --> 5606.88
you think that that's logical turret

5607.6 --> 5614.92
I don't believe it for a second

5610.54 --> 5617.08
if anything you probably bought that

5614.92 --> 5619.659
how the hell are you going to get 150

5617.08 --> 5621.84
case Subs as a flat Earth or out of

5619.659 --> 5621.839999999999
nothing

5641.699 --> 5647.08
means no

5644.08 --> 5650.34
no Jarvis no no most people don't just

5647.08 --> 5650.34
come for the entertainment

5650.62 --> 5656.199
they can't come here to be informed and

5653.26 --> 5658.360000000001
they'll learn something new or to

5656.199 --> 5660.82
share their insights

5658.36 --> 5665.4
right like buddies coming together and

5660.82 --> 5665.4
just talking it's like what we do here

5670.54 --> 5673.579
[Music]

5684.46 --> 5687.36
wow

5696.88 --> 5702.28
my journal is different yeah my channel

5699.699 --> 5704.82
is different I actually have continuous

5702.28 --> 5704.82
production

5710.199 --> 5715.32
I actually bring up interesting new

5713.02 --> 5715.320000000001
things

5716.139 --> 5720.6990000000005
I don't just regurgitate the same old

5718.719 --> 5725.58
[ __ ] over and over again that you hear

5720.699 --> 5725.58
everybody everybody else Echo endlessly

5729.04 --> 5734.08
so I don't care like what the [ __ ] is

5732.4 --> 5736.199
even interesting about that guy's

5734.08 --> 5736.199
Channel

5760.36 --> 5762.9
together

5789.699 --> 5797.98
okay turret so yeah tell me exactly

5793.179 --> 5801.84
which truth channel did grow

5797.98 --> 5801.839999999999
and what are they talking about

5805.54 --> 5808.739
hey Jeff gas said

5833.62 --> 5836.62
foreign

5854.199 --> 5859.239
why do I always have to wait a [ __ ]

5856.659 --> 5861.04
minute before anybody ever responds to

5859.239 --> 5863.739
something I ask

5861.04 --> 5865.92
but you all have two minutes delay or

5863.739 --> 5865.919999999999
something

5867.34 --> 5870.76
[ __ ]

5868.659 --> 5873.4
J dreamers

5870.76 --> 5875.4400000000005
right yeah but J dreamers I mean he

5873.4 --> 5877.96
barely even talks about Flat Earth but

5875.44 --> 5881.199
you got a point I don't get why he gets

5877.96 --> 5883.62
all the subs maybe because he never gets

5881.199 --> 5883.62
angry

5883.719 --> 5889.6
probably if I had never gotten angry I

5886.78 --> 5890.98
would have had 100K Subs too but I do

5889.6 --> 5893.08
get angry

5890.98 --> 5895.0
and now there's some people that really

5893.08 --> 5898.3
like that

5895.0 --> 5902.94
but there's like a huge amount of people

5898.3 --> 5902.9400000000005
that just like they can't handle it

5903.1 --> 5909.360000000001
I think that's probably what caused my

5906.1 --> 5909.360000000001
low subscriber amount

5910.06 --> 5913.38
is that I get angry

5915.88 --> 5924.3
although if I believe in the ball

5920.32 --> 5927.94
if I believed in all the horror [ __ ] sup

5924.3 --> 5931.4800000000005
mainstream narrative the alternative if

5927.94 --> 5935.259999999999
I just went with everything there then

5931.48 --> 5939.638999999999
if I get angry I'd be super popular yeah

5935.26 --> 5941.5
but because I'm a flat earther

5939.639 --> 5944.02
and a skeptic about a whole bunch of

5941.5 --> 5947.26
things well then when I get super angry

5944.02 --> 5949.780000000001
no no that's not cool because I don't

5947.26 --> 5952.679
believe in the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] that

5949.78 --> 5952.679
everybody believes in

5953.8 --> 5957.28
because they think they're smart because

5955.78 --> 5960.159
they

5957.28 --> 5962.08
found an alternative narrative that's

5960.159 --> 5964.12
contrasting to the mainstream narrative

5962.08 --> 5966.76
that's obviously fake

5964.12 --> 5968.26
you have to be an absolute [ __ ] not to

5966.76 --> 5970.360000000001
take notice of that

5968.26 --> 5973.6
right so you have found the alternative

5970.36 --> 5975.82
narrative so now you're better but no

5973.6 --> 5978.06
the Flat Earth or he's got it wrong well

5975.82 --> 5980.199
you just bought into

5978.06 --> 5983.38
planted misinformation

5980.199 --> 5984.82
by the Deep State the Deep State planted

5983.38 --> 5988.3
flattered

5984.82 --> 5990.46
because it can't be flat so we don't

5988.3 --> 5994.719
want to hear your angry ramblings

5990.46 --> 5996.94
because you're just wrong and misled

5994.719 --> 5998.7390000000005
right

5996.94 --> 6001.0199999999995
yeah

5998.739 --> 6003.718999999999
don't I just feel lucky

6001.02 --> 6006.4800000000005
being a flat earther and being angry

6003.719 --> 6009.9
yeah the one combination that doesn't

6006.48 --> 6012.0599999999995
work that isn't popular

6009.9 --> 6014.58
it's like nobody wants to hear an angry

6012.06 --> 6017.1
flat earther literally guess what I am

6014.58 --> 6019.5599999999995
I'm an angry flat earther

6017.1 --> 6021.4800000000005
I get angry

6019.56 --> 6024.26
and I'm not letting go of the Flat Earth

6021.48 --> 6024.259999999999
no matter what

6025.139 --> 6031.32
like I don't care I don't care if

6027.6 --> 6035.1
[ __ ] reality itself starts warping

6031.32 --> 6038.5199999999995
I know it's flat I will hang on to flat

6035.1 --> 6040.679
even if my weird perception changes even

6038.52 --> 6043.320000000001
if I get stuck in the Dark World another

6040.679 --> 6046.1
80 years out of nowhere

6043.32 --> 6050.48
I will hold on that it's flat forever

6046.1 --> 6050.4800000000005
even in the abyss

6051.03 --> 6056.4
[Music]

6054.0 --> 6058.739
it's like I literally don't care anymore

6056.4 --> 6061.5599999999995
what you think what anybody thinks about

6058.739 --> 6065.178999999999
that or what anybody's conclusion is I

6061.56 --> 6065.179
will never let it go

6065.94 --> 6071.339999999999
even if God himself tells me I will go

6069.659 --> 6074.04
to hell

6071.34 --> 6077.360000000001
if I believe the Earth is flat then I

6074.04 --> 6077.36
will go to hell

6086.1 --> 6090.42
you cannot prove serient typically

6088.139 --> 6092.58
flavor Globe yeah that's correct I know

6090.42 --> 6094.8
that

6092.58 --> 6097.86
because

6094.8 --> 6102.6
flat or Globe is a geometric what is

6097.86 --> 6104.88
question not a what causes a thing a

6102.6 --> 6107.179
phenomenon it's not a phenomenon it's a

6104.88 --> 6107.179
shape

6107.28 --> 6112.739
so geometry it's like that's not science

6110.52 --> 6115.46
that's correct

6112.739 --> 6115.459999999999
what's up

6118.26 --> 6125.119000000001
I can't talk about letter did anybody in

6120.84 --> 6125.119000000001
real life yeah except I can and I do

6125.88 --> 6133.1990000000005
not a lot but I do

6129.42 --> 6136.139
every new roommate must know that I talk

6133.199 --> 6138.0199999999995
about Flat Earth every single one I've

6136.139 --> 6143.1
had like

6138.02 --> 6146.179
40. or something not in the maybe 20 in

6143.1 --> 6146.179
the last eight years

6148.4 --> 6151.46
thank you

6168.96 --> 6172.679
and listen if letters that are thick

6170.94 --> 6175.94
skin don't get butt hurt when their

6172.679 --> 6175.9400000000005
claims are challenged yeah

6179.699 --> 6184.5
right like globuster weenies that

6182.159 --> 6185.5199999999995
literally kick out Ballers out of their

6184.5 --> 6189.619
chat

6185.52 --> 6189.619000000001
because they say the Earth is of all

6192.54 --> 6196.199
I don't kick people out just because

6194.34 --> 6199.04
they say that I'm just gonna laugh at

6196.199 --> 6199.04
them instead

6200.219 --> 6205.159
or prove them wrong that's much more

6202.56 --> 6205.159000000001
entertaining

6225.719 --> 6230.52
no you heard what you heard something

6227.82 --> 6232.739
[ __ ] Jarvis

6230.52 --> 6234.2390000000005
who's not flat because of hills and

6232.739 --> 6236.04
mountains yeah but

6234.239 --> 6239.4
it's not about

6236.04 --> 6241.0199999999995
the surface structure

6239.4 --> 6243.54
yeah

6241.02 --> 6245.34
it's about the average and it's most

6243.54 --> 6248.04
importantly about the geometric

6245.34 --> 6251.88
orientation

6248.04 --> 6255.719
that is the thing that is flat

6251.88 --> 6257.1
not the surface yeah there is like

6255.719 --> 6260.04
literally

6257.1 --> 6262.7390000000005
when you zoom in on matter there is no

6260.04 --> 6264.119
flag literally because everything is not

6262.739 --> 6266.459999999999
flat

6264.119 --> 6269.46
when you zoom in enough nothing is flat

6266.46 --> 6271.619
flat doesn't exist physically in that

6269.46 --> 6275.639
sense

6271.619 --> 6277.88
but it's not about that it's about the

6275.639 --> 6277.88
average

6278.4 --> 6284.699
yeah when you average everything out

6282.36 --> 6287.9
that's flat

6284.699 --> 6287.9
it's not spherical

6307.8 --> 6314.04
okay Jarvis hey why did you [ __ ] stop

6311.04 --> 6317.42
talking to people in my chat like that

6314.04 --> 6317.42
you arrogant [ __ ]

6318.54 --> 6321.38
how about that

6326.13 --> 6329.329
[Music]

6329.76 --> 6336.38
kick this [ __ ] out

6332.82 --> 6336.38
sounds like a wanker

6353.34 --> 6357.900000000001
you just needed the proof that you're a

6355.619 --> 6360.48
certified you didn't have that already

6357.9 --> 6363.239
there it is

6360.48 --> 6366.0
I mean he already said

6363.239 --> 6368.94
it's not flat because of mountains and

6366.0 --> 6372.139
valleys seriously do you need anything

6368.94 --> 6372.138999999999
else after that

6388.26 --> 6393.2390000000005
so he's

6390.179 --> 6396.86
like a Bev baller he's like a baller

6393.239 --> 6396.86
that's like yeah Dev is right

6398.159 --> 6404.04
yep

6399.48 --> 6405.78
well if people say that it's not flat

6404.04 --> 6411.199
well then they're not flat earthers

6405.78 --> 6411.199
they're just retards or bevites

6431.1 --> 6435.139

you know go [ __ ] yourself so I'm just

6535.32 --> 6539.4
deleting all of you

6537.42 --> 6541.1990000000005
so you can spend another half hour

6539.4 --> 6542.879999999999
building new stock accounts for yourself

6541.199 --> 6545.599999999999
because you don't have anything else to

6542.88 --> 6545.6
do with your life

6548.1 --> 6550.280000000001
okay

6553.219 --> 6562.04
grumpy now they're not grumpy

6557.76 --> 6562.04
I'm doing just fine I mean

6562.86 --> 6569.0599999999995
I basically figured out

6565.28 --> 6569.0599999999995
dialectic acceleration

6569.46 --> 6576.08
I feel very satisfied just for that word

6572.88 --> 6576.08
being in the title alone

6580.739 --> 6587.4
so you guys can all forget about

6583.699 --> 6591.379999999999
dielectric acceleration

6587.4 --> 6595.58
and just make that disappear

6591.38 --> 6598.56
just let the dialectic acceleration

6595.58 --> 6601.679
Mandela effect dielectric acceleration

6598.56 --> 6602.6990000000005
nonsense out of your mind okay just look

6601.679 --> 6605.76
at it

6602.699 --> 6608.638999999999
and realize that's real

6605.76 --> 6611.52
that's something that's real now dialect

6608.639 --> 6614.219
trick when there's this R in there

6611.52 --> 6615.96
this that's nonsense

6614.219 --> 6618.5
there is no such thing there's no

6615.96 --> 6621.3
dielectric acceleration there is

6618.5 --> 6623.1
dialectic acceleration

6621.3 --> 6626.46
to just soak it up

6623.1 --> 6631.04
let Mandela affect correct

6626.46 --> 6631.04
the nonsense out of existence

6674.58 --> 6677.639
right anyway I hope you guys are

6676.02 --> 6681.4800000000005
enjoying the show

6677.639 --> 6683.52
oh been going for almost two hours huh

6681.48 --> 6685.379999999999
I thought it was one hour

6683.52 --> 6687.9800000000005
I guess it's been interesting hey is

6685.38 --> 6687.9800000000005
that Tempe

6691.619 --> 6696.48
let's see new for a while I don't think

6694.38 --> 6698.88
that people trolling Flat Earth is ever

6696.48 --> 6701.5199999999995
going to stop yeah because it's the last

6698.88 --> 6704.46
thing they get to do in life

6701.52 --> 6707.34
you have nothing else that faces them

6704.46 --> 6708.4800000000005
they're just robots in a delusional

6707.34 --> 6710.639
world

6708.48 --> 6711.959999999999
but Flat Earth snaps them out of that

6710.639 --> 6715.26
robot

6711.96 --> 6717.78
Tranquility so then they have to attack

6715.26 --> 6720.4800000000005
Flat Earth but it's not gonna go away so

6717.78 --> 6721.5
they just keep stuck in attacking Flat

6720.48 --> 6724.32
Earth

6721.5 --> 6726.9
to attempt to robotically erase that

6724.32 --> 6728.46
thing that's agitating them from away

6726.9 --> 6730.5599999999995
from their Tranquility but it's never

6728.46 --> 6732.54
gonna go away

6730.56 --> 6733.8
so now they're just wasting their life

6732.54 --> 6736.38
away

6733.8 --> 6739.1
trying to erase something that they

6736.38 --> 6739.1
can't erase

6740.76 --> 6746.2390000000005
so it's really tragic when you think

6743.46 --> 6746.2390000000005
about it carefully

6760.17 --> 6763.39
[Music]

6775.94 --> 6779.599999999999
using big words

6791.58 --> 6797.28
I mean that's such a lame troll comment

6794.28 --> 6799.5
it's not even worth Banning

6797.28 --> 6801.36
I mean if your trolling is just too

6799.5 --> 6803.719
pathetic then I'm not even gonna delete

6801.36 --> 6803.719
you

6808.44 --> 6811.04
right

6817.739 --> 6821.04
maybe stops everybody stops leaving the

6819.9 --> 6824.04
globe

6821.04 --> 6826.44
well no I don't think so I don't think

6824.04 --> 6830.239
that it is even globally that's driving

6826.44 --> 6830.239
people to do it most of the time

6831.48 --> 6838.0199999999995
I think it's fear of the truth

6835.32 --> 6840.86
fear of people catching on I think it's

6838.02 --> 6840.860000000001
fair of

6841.38 --> 6847.86
people in general that would be seen by

6844.56 --> 6850.56
certain types as cattle

6847.86 --> 6853.799999999999
I think what drives them to troll flat

6850.56 --> 6855.900000000001
earthers could also be the fear that the

6853.8 --> 6859.04
cattles will wake up too much and start

6855.9 --> 6859.04
stampeding the fence

6860.58 --> 6867.92
in which chaos would ensue

6865.199 --> 6870.9
I think it it's that it's not even about

6867.92 --> 6873.659
whether the Earth is flat or a globe

6870.9 --> 6876.659
it's just pure fear like oh the the

6873.659 --> 6878.78
cattle is growing out of control

6876.659 --> 6881.4
we have to get in the way we have to

6878.78 --> 6884.219
distract them we have to get them caught

6881.4 --> 6886.5
up in stupid bickering

6884.219 --> 6890.4
that's good enough like they don't even

6886.5 --> 6890.4
have to care really

6890.699 --> 6895.259999999999
the Earth being a globe

6892.98 --> 6898.739
being their belief doesn't even have to

6895.26 --> 6901.679
be the drive for them to do it

6898.739 --> 6904.199
sometimes it's just pure fear it's like

6901.679 --> 6906.78
this person's too free

6904.199 --> 6908.82
I decided in my life to not have that

6906.78 --> 6912.42
freedom and [ __ ] to the Beast for a

6908.82 --> 6915.96
prophet and respect

6912.42 --> 6917.1
of my direct peers

6915.96 --> 6919.4
right

6917.1 --> 6923.34
to not have them yell at me all the time

6919.4 --> 6926.4
so I am not agreeing with you having

6923.34 --> 6928.26
chosen not to do that and being able to

6926.4 --> 6931.08
speak freely

6928.26 --> 6933.96
sometimes that is the threat

6931.08 --> 6936.6
not even the subject

6933.96 --> 6938.28
it's just that hey you're talking out of

6936.6 --> 6940.619000000001
line I don't even care whether the Earth

6938.28 --> 6943.259999999999
is a globe or flat officially it's a

6940.619 --> 6945.42
globe you not agreeing with that makes

6943.26 --> 6947.900000000001
you out of line and I'm gonna attack you

6945.42 --> 6947.9
for that

6951.84 --> 6957.2390000000005
like a nice

6953.58 --> 6957.239
good 1984

6958.44 --> 6962.9
little

6959.94 --> 6962.9
tattletail

6969.32 --> 6974.58
to be fair I never I control plenty in

6972.239 --> 6977.4
the past Never Enough yeah but you are

6974.58 --> 6979.0199999999995
provably a ball [ __ ] you are one that

6977.4 --> 6980.759999999999
doesn't mean that all trolls are ball

6979.02 --> 6983.580000000001
tarts

6980.76 --> 6985.619000000001
some of them just don't care

6983.58 --> 6987.9
they they just

6985.619 --> 6989.639
they just want people to stop talking

6987.9 --> 6993.199
out of line

6989.639 --> 6993.1990000000005
with the official narrative

6993.81 --> 6998.159000000001
[Music]

6995.46 --> 7000.199
yeah good luck with your

6998.159 --> 7003.379999999999
your projection

7000.199 --> 7006.46
case there are backup records now

7003.38 --> 7006.46
see you never again

7025.159 --> 7031.04
yeah Tara that's very nice it also means

7028.04 --> 7033.86
that he's actually trying

7031.04 --> 7036.739
that's the difference that zept happy is

7033.86 --> 7038.48
actually trying to understand

7036.739 --> 7040.699
there's trolls that don't try to

7038.48 --> 7043.459999999999
understand they're just there

7040.699 --> 7045.619
to get in your way because they can feel

7043.46 --> 7047.84
that you are too free and that you're

7045.619 --> 7051.0199999999995
talking about things that contradict

7047.84 --> 7054.02
official narrative and they don't care

7051.02 --> 7055.639
whether it is true or not they just

7054.02 --> 7058.219
don't want you to contradict the

7055.639 --> 7060.8
official narrative and that's why they

7058.219 --> 7062.96
then bully you and distract you

7060.8 --> 7065.7390000000005
because there are people like that out

7062.96 --> 7065.7390000000005
there plenty

7088.82 --> 7093.349999999999
hmm

7090.18 --> 7093.35
[Music]

7098.8 --> 7102.9800000000005
ah lovely weather except for the

7101.719 --> 7104.9
chemtrails

7102.98 --> 7108.098999999999
that are very

7104.9 --> 7108.098999999999
very much there

7115.599 --> 7120.400000000001
unless you think that that Cloud's

7117.98 --> 7120.4
natural

7123.98 --> 7128.86
I mean there's always x's in the sky

7126.32 --> 7131.9
there's always been x's in the sky right

7128.86 --> 7133.28
even in the 19th century when there

7131.9 --> 7134.9
weren't airplanes they weren't always

7133.28 --> 7136.4
that right

7134.9 --> 7138.92
which is big

7136.4 --> 7140.598999999999
lines crossing each other like an X in

7138.92 --> 7142.9
the middle of the sky It's Perfectly

7140.599 --> 7142.900000000001
Normal

7150.26 --> 7156.6990000000005
anyway Sun's still coming through so I'm

7153.139 --> 7156.6990000000005
not really complaining that much

7166.29 --> 7169.439
[Music]

7178.88 --> 7182.599
nobody even acknowledges it yeah they

7181.04 --> 7184.219
don't care they're like what are they

7182.599 --> 7186.02
gonna do about it

7184.219 --> 7188.619
they don't want to think about why

7186.02 --> 7188.619000000001
that's there

7188.63 --> 7191.76
[Music]

7194.119 --> 7199.719
dude I start I noticed Chemtrails since

7196.58 --> 7199.719
like 2008

7204.26 --> 7209.1990000000005
I started to notice that was really

7206.119 --> 7209.199
unnatural back then

7210.4 --> 7215.9
also that there would be like very

7212.96 --> 7218.96
bizarre aberrations like airplanes just

7215.9 --> 7221.119
making Corners like leaving a trail and

7218.96 --> 7223.28
then just suddenly changing direction

7221.119 --> 7225.32
and [ __ ] it's like

7223.28 --> 7227.9
why

7225.32 --> 7230.78
why the hell would an airplane just made

7227.9 --> 7232.4
flights suddenly change direction like

7230.78 --> 7236.139
that

7232.4 --> 7236.138999999999
it makes no freaking sense

7238.219 --> 7242.96
and like not one of them a lot like

7240.98 --> 7244.94
there would be places sometimes where I

7242.96 --> 7246.32
look and you just see like all these

7244.94 --> 7248.659
corners

7246.32 --> 7251.48
like all this weird

7248.659 --> 7254.48
corners of Trail like what the [ __ ] is

7251.48 --> 7257.5
happening there why do they take Corners

7254.48 --> 7257.5
there it makes no sense

7259.639 --> 7263.659000000001
I've been seeing contrails

7262.159 --> 7267.98
yeah

7263.659 --> 7270.638999999999
I'm seeing a con Trail right there

7267.98 --> 7270.638999999999
what's up

7275.239 --> 7281.178999999999
contrail yeah it's not contrails

7277.659 --> 7284.799999999999
contrails evaporate very quickly

7281.179 --> 7284.8
they don't linger

7295.04 --> 7303.32
yeah

7297.5 --> 7306.219
it dissolves in the air it evaporates

7303.32 --> 7306.219
very quickly

7306.619 --> 7310.759999999999
it's like just because of the lower

7308.54 --> 7312.92
pressure situation alone because it's

7310.76 --> 7314.900000000001
way above where clouds typically are

7312.92 --> 7316.88
right that's where airplanes fly Above

7314.9 --> 7320.138999999999
the Clouds

7316.88 --> 7322.58
so yeah duh

7320.139 --> 7325.76
moisture is not just going to be there

7322.58 --> 7328.82
in like form clouds very easily

7325.76 --> 7332.42
because it's not the right height

7328.82 --> 7335.179
it's too cold and too low pressure so

7332.42 --> 7338.54
it's just immediately gonna disperse and

7335.179 --> 7340.52
dissolve that's why actual contrails

7338.54 --> 7342.44
you can see the little plane going in

7340.52 --> 7345.38
the sky leaving a trail and then that

7342.44 --> 7348.86
trail follows them around

7345.38 --> 7351.08
that's a contrail because after a

7348.86 --> 7356.42
certain period of time

7351.08 --> 7358.94
that missed that contrail like dissolves

7356.42 --> 7361.4
it becomes pure water vapor and no

7358.94 --> 7363.5599999999995
longer any form of liquid or droplet

7361.4 --> 7365.239
and then you don't see it anymore that's

7363.56 --> 7369.080000000001
a contrail

7365.239 --> 7373.098999999999
if it sticks around Way Beyond the

7369.08 --> 7375.94
airplane being in sight then it's not a

7373.099 --> 7375.9400000000005
contrail

7376.699 --> 7383.719
water in the high air doesn't just keep

7380.719 --> 7387.58
hanging there that's not how moist

7383.719 --> 7387.58
behaves up there

7388.28 --> 7393.08
it would have to be

7390.28 --> 7397.9
solid particles

7393.08 --> 7397.9
if they are to keep sticking around

7404.199 --> 7411.259999999999
that's right conning you into thinking

7406.52 --> 7411.26
it's a contra that's right a con Trail

7412.52 --> 7415.52
right

7416.3 --> 7422.719
an actual contrail would be people

7420.5 --> 7425.199
that told you no no there's no

7422.719 --> 7429.5
Chemtrails it's all contrails

7425.199 --> 7433.239
ironically people that do that are a con

7429.5 --> 7435.38
Trail they're a trail of con artists

7433.239 --> 7438.199
that fool you

7435.38 --> 7441.219
into believing it's all contrails it's

7438.199 --> 7441.219
funny how that works

7446.119 --> 7450.799999999999
this will blower showing the mechanisms

7448.04 --> 7452.3
yes they have been there yes except

7450.8 --> 7455.2390000000005
Daddy

7452.3 --> 7458.900000000001
there's big websites that keep track of

7455.239 --> 7460.94
chemtrails things for like over a decade

7458.9 --> 7463.638999999999
and yes

7460.94 --> 7466.5199999999995
people have come out with footage and

7463.639 --> 7469.58
photography of them getting out of

7466.52 --> 7471.8
planes that have tankers in them

7469.58 --> 7474.5
that literally spray

7471.8 --> 7478.34
solid particles

7474.5 --> 7481.46
like those planes are built to do that

7478.34 --> 7483.1990000000005
and they look like typical

7481.46 --> 7486.34
planes

7483.199 --> 7486.339999999999
without markings

7486.739 --> 7490.5199999999995
I have seen the actual photographs of

7489.56 --> 7492.860000000001
that

7490.52 --> 7496.42
so yes there are definitely

7492.86 --> 7496.42
whistleblowers about that

7506.32 --> 7511.759999999999
geoengineering that's right there's an

7508.219 --> 7516.02
admitted plan for these types of actions

7511.76 --> 7518.96
it's already engaged since 95.

7516.02 --> 7521.780000000001
they started the testing since 95 for

7518.96 --> 7525.44
the Geo engineering program officially

7521.78 --> 7528.199
that's when the Chemtrails started

7525.44 --> 7530.299999999999
that's when the persistent Trails

7528.199 --> 7534.219
started

7530.3 --> 7537.820000000001
also when weird Morgellons

7534.219 --> 7537.82
experiments started

7538.28 --> 7543.44
certain areas got weird experimental

7541.34 --> 7545.2390000000005
stuff sprayed on them and Lead it to

7543.44 --> 7548.0599999999995
Morgellons disease

7545.239 --> 7552.678999999999
but that's not continuous than God

7548.06 --> 7554.780000000001
but they have used it for toxic tests

7552.679 --> 7556.58
just like oh what happened how we want

7554.78 --> 7558.8
to test this well

7556.58 --> 7560.84
We're not gonna find volunteers for that

7558.8 --> 7563.8
or we don't have the budget so just

7560.84 --> 7567.02
spray this area and

7563.8 --> 7570.92
alert our doctors

7567.02 --> 7572.900000000001
to uh to keep track of that and then we

7570.92 --> 7577.0
can have very cheap medical experience

7572.9 --> 7577.0
without any anybody knowing about it

7578.3 --> 7580.900000000001
right

7587.56 --> 7593.5
should you link it or point me to it no

7593.84 --> 7598.46
I don't remember

7595.88 --> 7603.099
geoengineering.org

7598.46 --> 7603.099
probably let me see if that is something

7615.5 --> 7619.119
is that it what is this

7627.5 --> 7633.28
what the hell okay no that's not a site

7630.679 --> 7633.28
I guess

7640.76 --> 7645.76
oh

7642.159 --> 7645.759999999999
geoengineeringwatch.org that was it

7645.92 --> 7652.099
that's a relatively old website

7649.28 --> 7654.619
that's been like it still looks like

7652.099 --> 7656.78
it's from the 90s

7654.619 --> 7659.0
that's an old one it's been around

7656.78 --> 7662.08
forever so you could check that one out

7659.0 --> 7662.08
here's it

7670.4 --> 7675.0199999999995
there's probably some kooky stuff on

7672.739 --> 7678.759999999999
there too by the way most things that

7675.02 --> 7678.76
there were like from the 90s did

7678.98 --> 7683.98
it's like that's just they all did that

7687.32 --> 7690.94
it looks so 90s

7691.699 --> 7694.299999999999
anyway

7695.599 --> 7698.860000000001
Cloud City yeah yeah

7731.599 --> 7746.149
foreign

7734.42 --> 7746.149
[Music]

7750.95 --> 7754.12
[Music]

7756.02 --> 7761.92
yeah

7758.599 --> 7764.659000000001
so I think that pretty soon I think in

7761.92 --> 7767.599
2024 there's going to be like actual

7764.659 --> 7770.719
initiation of the 50-minute system

7767.599 --> 7773.659000000001
50-minute City systems

7770.719 --> 7776.36
but it's gonna it is definitely not

7773.659 --> 7778.4
gonna work because it's rushed they

7776.36 --> 7781.119
rushed it all and it's not working

7778.4 --> 7784.638999999999
they've had too many setbacks too many

7781.119 --> 7786.08
obstacles where it things wouldn't be

7784.639 --> 7788.659000000001
done it's like

7786.08 --> 7791.0599999999995
it's because people like they don't want

7788.659 --> 7792.619
to progress in this direction so it's

7791.06 --> 7794.42
like everybody's on the brakes well

7792.619 --> 7796.219
guess what they're gonna roll it out

7794.42 --> 7798.04
still but because they rushed it and

7796.219 --> 7801.7390000000005
they don't have everything

7798.04 --> 7805.099
arranged properly it's going to buckle

7801.739 --> 7808.759999999999
and fall apart very blatantly

7805.099 --> 7811.219
so I I am going to predict

7808.76 --> 7813.1990000000005
not through the Dark World by the way no

7811.219 --> 7815.36
no entanglements there

7813.199 --> 7816.619
I didn't care at the time at all about

7815.36 --> 7819.739
this sort of thing

7816.619 --> 7821.659
but I predict just by thinking about it

7819.739 --> 7824.598999999999
and how things are unrolling that

7821.659 --> 7827.179
there's gonna be 15 minute cities like

7824.599 --> 7829.52
officially out there

7827.179 --> 7831.92
in in 2024

7829.52 --> 7833.540000000001
but they are like gonna really fail

7831.92 --> 7837.32
miserably

7833.54 --> 7839.239
like quickly because not because it's so

7837.32 --> 7841.099
terrible but because things are just not

7839.239 --> 7843.98
gonna function and break all the time

7841.099 --> 7845.84
and like the scanners won't work and

7843.98 --> 7848.0599999999995
probably get

7845.84 --> 7849.9800000000005
wrapped in shared and it's got to be a

7848.06 --> 7854.139
mess and it's not gonna work that's my

7849.98 --> 7854.138999999999
prediction Our Winning prediction here

7858.4 --> 7862.54
maybe we'll put it in the title

7863.45 --> 7871.898999999999
[Music]

7877.93 --> 7888.049
[Music]

7889.639 --> 7892.639

7892.9 --> 7895.978999999999
[Music]

7897.69 --> 7900.79
[Applause]

7916.219 --> 7921.32
yes this fits

7919.58 --> 7923.84
how about this

7921.32 --> 7926.619
so now the title is dielectric oh sorry

7923.84 --> 7930.7390000000005
dialectic acceleration and

7926.619 --> 7933.28
2024 rushed 15-minute City catastrophic

7930.739 --> 7933.28
failure

7933.739 --> 7936.699
what do you think guys

7945.679 --> 7952.659
at least it's just the prediction is

7948.38 --> 7952.659000000001
just literally in the title now right

7954.08 --> 7959.3
I mean it's not hard to find this back

7957.44 --> 7961.219
it's just like browse for the title and

7959.3 --> 7963.08
you'll see like yeah 2024 rushed

7961.219 --> 7967.179
50-minute City catastrophic failure

7963.08 --> 7967.179
seems pretty damn straightforward

7981.5 --> 7987.219
you know even mermaids what the [ __ ]

7983.719 --> 7987.219
Derrick where is that coming from

8016.54 --> 8022.78
everyone here is talking about it in

8019.36 --> 8027.54
Canada 50 minutes it is like normies

8022.78 --> 8027.54
really so there that's weird

8030.96 --> 8035.26
anyway I'm gonna take it two minute

8033.82 --> 8037.9
break

8035.26 --> 8040.7390000000005
be right back

8037.9 --> 8040.739
foreign

8104.98 --> 8107.579
foreign

8148.719 --> 8151.44
okay

8158.88 --> 8162.42
and I'm back

8188.679 --> 8195.0
why are you saying that

8191.739 --> 8195.0
Jeff gas head

8195.88 --> 8198.899
how's that funny

8221.32 --> 8226.479
I don't get that like what maybe just a

8224.2 --> 8229.42
cover for burning height what are you

8226.479 --> 8231.519
talking about what's up

8229.42 --> 8234.939
how does that relate to what anything

8231.519 --> 8237.7
said in this chat thus far

8234.939 --> 8241.78
I just don't get it

8237.7 --> 8241.78
what's up with the incoherence

8261.34 --> 8268.719000000001
YouTube removed your comment yeah it's

8263.8 --> 8271.779999999999
because climate is a No-No subject

8268.719 --> 8274.719
they're mostly going for the chats

8271.78 --> 8277.359
as in I'm not getting any strikes for

8274.719 --> 8280.119999999999
saying that yeah they're man-made

8277.359 --> 8282.460000000001
climate change the models they use are

8280.12 --> 8285.939
idiotic

8282.46 --> 8290.139
and like the entire preface for the

8285.939 --> 8294.28
entire premise of their cult beliefs is

8290.139 --> 8297.339999999998
all completely catastrophically wrong

8294.28 --> 8301.359
there's absolutely zero risk of anything

8297.34 --> 8304.0
that they claim zero percent risk

8301.359 --> 8307.12
zero percent risk of everything they

8304.0 --> 8308.2
claim zero percent zero percent risk of

8307.12 --> 8310.660000000002
that

8308.2 --> 8313.899000000001
because the entire preface for their

8310.66 --> 8316.059
studies are completely catastrophically

8313.899 --> 8319.08
incorrect

8316.059 --> 8319.08
and that's a fact

8321.7 --> 8328.479000000001
right but the chats

8324.46 --> 8330.16
yeah YouTube has set another policy

8328.479 --> 8333.519
where it's like they're just gonna

8330.16 --> 8335.019
delete those words if people talk about

8333.519 --> 8338.800000000001
it

8335.019 --> 8341.2
so that like anti-climate change trolls

8338.8 --> 8344.82
because they are out there people that

8341.2 --> 8344.820000000002
are just trolling against it

8346.179 --> 8351.58
right not really serving a constructive

8349.54 --> 8355.240000000002
purpose but just doing that so that they

8351.58 --> 8357.46
don't get the room to just show how

8355.24 --> 8359.439
ridiculous it all is

8357.46 --> 8361.598999999998
but they're not they don't seem to like

8359.439 --> 8364.0
strike people

8361.599 --> 8367.42
it's like if I put the words in the

8364.0 --> 8369.58
title in a negative light then

8367.42 --> 8371.8
they'd probably

8369.58 --> 8374.559
like strike

8371.8 --> 8376.719
or remove the video or something

8374.559 --> 8379.679
so they're going after the words not

8376.719 --> 8379.678999999998
after the content

8391.44 --> 8394.589
[Music]

8394.72 --> 8400.66
our people believing CO2 is bad well it

8398.68 --> 8404.32
isn't they are not believing that the

8400.66 --> 8405.82
idea of CO2 being bad is because of a

8404.32 --> 8409.24
presumed

8405.82 --> 8413.34
Globe Earth model based idea that the

8409.24 --> 8413.34
CO2 contributes to

8413.64 --> 8421.32
absorbing and not letting Escape The

8416.8 --> 8421.32
Heat Of The Sun within the atmosphere

8421.6 --> 8427.18
that's what it is it's a fear that the

8424.96 --> 8428.56
CO2 might heat up

8427.18 --> 8431.439
the world

8428.56 --> 8433.06
but it's all garbage because CO2 levels

8431.439 --> 8435.58
have literally been going down

8433.06 --> 8439.119999999999
dramatically

8435.58 --> 8442.24
in the last few decades

8439.12 --> 8443.92
and it not doesn't change anything and

8442.24 --> 8446.8
they're still saying oh it's too much

8443.92 --> 8450.28
it's all horseshit it's like oh we need

8446.8 --> 8452.56
to change this well we did change it and

8450.28 --> 8454.960000000001
nothing changed except that we changed

8452.56 --> 8456.46
that and that just moving on to the next

8454.96 --> 8459.699999999999
thing and that's why they now go after

8456.46 --> 8461.38
nitrogen and then after

8459.7 --> 8463.54
a while that I'm sure they're going to

8461.38 --> 8467.019999999999
go after oxygen too after everything

8463.54 --> 8470.2
water they'll be like uh water is a

8467.02 --> 8472.84
pollutant oxygen is a pollutant like all

8470.2 --> 8475.66
the essential building blocks for life

8472.84 --> 8478.359
to exist are a pollutant that's what

8475.66 --> 8480.939
they're gonna do it just started with

8478.359 --> 8482.02
CO2 which is also a building block of

8480.939 --> 8484.359
life

8482.02 --> 8486.880000000001
an essential ingredient

8484.359 --> 8489.52
for respiration

8486.88 --> 8491.56
I mean for

8489.52 --> 8495.220000000001
what do you call that breathing

8491.56 --> 8498.1
all forms of breathing plant breathe

8495.22 --> 8500.199999999999
plants animals all things that breathe

8498.1 --> 8504.04
that interact with air

8500.2 --> 8506.859
have exchanges with CO2 either dumping

8504.04 --> 8510.1
it or absorbing it for use

8506.859 --> 8513.300000000001
so CR2 is an essential ingredient for

8510.1 --> 8513.300000000001
life to breathe

8514.479 --> 8518.319
and it's just the first one that's been

8517.18 --> 8521.26
targeted

8518.319 --> 8523.0
for being bad and for people have to cut

8521.26 --> 8526.62
down it's like all the things that life

8523.0 --> 8526.62
needs you have to cut down on it

8527.859 --> 8531.54
that's what they're trying to force

8532.66 --> 8538.26
because it's not about cleaning up the

8535.06 --> 8538.26
environment it's about

8538.74 --> 8545.74
forbidding the ingredients for life

8543.28 --> 8548.62
that's what it's for

8545.74 --> 8551.619999999999
yeah their forbidding life because life

8548.62 --> 8553.42
is polluting that's that's the reasoning

8551.62 --> 8554.62
behind it it's like oh if we don't cut

8553.42 --> 8556.12
down on

8554.62 --> 8560.04
on these

8556.12 --> 8563.2
gases that life needs to exist well

8560.04 --> 8565.479000000001
then there will be a giant disaster and

8563.2 --> 8566.939
there is never a giant disaster and any

8565.479 --> 8570.22
prediction

8566.939 --> 8572.319
based on oh some gas is escaping that's

8570.22 --> 8575.56
going to change everything every

8572.319 --> 8577.6
prediction ever made with that has

8575.56 --> 8581.58
always been wrong

8577.6 --> 8583.6
without exception every single supposed

8581.58 --> 8585.22
catastrophic climate change prediction

8583.6 --> 8587.08
has ever been made and it's been made

8585.22 --> 8590.019999999999
for quite a while guys there have been

8587.08 --> 8591.399
predictions in newspapers in the 19th

8590.02 --> 8596.5
century

8591.399 --> 8599.46
and all of them without exception have

8596.5 --> 8599.46
been wrong

8601.319 --> 8608.68
every single climate change prediction

8606.16 --> 8610.359
that has been registered in human

8608.68 --> 8614.859
history

8610.359 --> 8617.5
has been wrong

8614.859 --> 8619.84
it's like oh we have to do this or this

8617.5 --> 8622.06
will happen negative have will happen

8619.84 --> 8623.859
every single prediction in in that

8622.06 --> 8625.96
setting has been wrong now there have

8623.859 --> 8627.939
been predictions like hey yeah uh

8625.96 --> 8630.88
uh we're noticing that the Sahara in

8627.939 --> 8632.800000000001
these locations is Greening up

8630.88 --> 8634.479
right

8632.8 --> 8636.16
well it's not really prediction they

8634.479 --> 8638.08
just noticed like hey this is happening

8636.16 --> 8642.1
the climate is changing for the better

8638.08 --> 8644.319
how was that well there's been more CO2

8642.1 --> 8647.26
production here and there at these power

8644.319 --> 8649.96
plants in the cities and and yeah that's

8647.26 --> 8652.06
literally causing life to just manifest

8649.96 --> 8654.58
in the desert

8652.06 --> 8657.819
oh okay

8654.58 --> 8659.5
so there the climate can change even by

8657.819 --> 8661.6
man-made

8659.5 --> 8664.24
influences

8661.6 --> 8666.16
but there's never like a catastrophe

8664.24 --> 8668.619999999999
that happens because of it

8666.16 --> 8671.14
other than in the past because it

8668.62 --> 8674.76
doesn't really happen anymore

8671.14 --> 8679.0
pollution like pollution from industry

8674.76 --> 8681.22
not filtering out certain toxic residues

8679.0 --> 8684.04
that then just get that dumped in the

8681.22 --> 8685.779999999999
air with the smoke and that causes

8684.04 --> 8688.479000000001
damage the pollution well guess what

8685.78 --> 8689.92
there's been so many Environmental

8688.479 --> 8692.08
research

8689.92 --> 8695.08
to basically

8692.08 --> 8697.479
stop that from happening that it's not

8695.08 --> 8702.16
there anymore

8697.479 --> 8703.358999999999
industry now is very clean on average

8702.16 --> 8706.6
because

8703.359 --> 8708.399000000001
that's mandated it must be clean or

8706.6 --> 8709.84
you're gonna get in trouble with the

8708.399 --> 8712.479
government

8709.84 --> 8714.76
unless maybe you're in China

8712.479 --> 8718.539999999999
where they don't give a [ __ ]

8714.76 --> 8721.78
or they're not required to give a [ __ ]

8718.54 --> 8725.2
they just make things clean for Prestige

8721.78 --> 8727.899000000001
because they're not mandated

8725.2 --> 8731.08
to clean things up or to make things

8727.899 --> 8732.46
more livable for the people they don't

8731.08 --> 8735.76
give a [ __ ]

8732.46 --> 8739.858999999999
so they clean up for Prestige just to

8735.76 --> 8743.02
show everyone in the world that they can

8739.859 --> 8745.0
that's why they do that not because it's

8743.02 --> 8747.960000000001
required for the people they don't give

8745.0 --> 8747.96
a [ __ ] about the people

8756.88 --> 8763.599999999999
pollute this yes September I know

8760.479 --> 8764.679999999998
and India could very well learn from

8763.6 --> 8767.5
China

8764.68 --> 8769.979000000001
in that sense China actually managed to

8767.5 --> 8772.66
figure out systems where they have

8769.979 --> 8773.74
gigantic air filters just in the middle

8772.66 --> 8776.859
of the city

8773.74 --> 8780.42
pumping through enormous amount of air

8776.859 --> 8783.880000000001
and that literally like [ __ ] breaks out

8780.42 --> 8787.359
interactive less a continual process and

8783.88 --> 8790.0
just bricks are getting pumped out

8787.359 --> 8791.5
from all the compacted filtered dust

8790.0 --> 8793.92
that they got out of there and just Pump

8791.5 --> 8793.92
It Up

8794.28 --> 8799.78
all day long they just suck all the dust

8797.979 --> 8801.34
out of the air and it just falls down

8799.78 --> 8803.92
like bricks

8801.34 --> 8806.56
or [ __ ] out by that machine yeah and

8803.92 --> 8809.56
that really cleans up the air in like

8806.56 --> 8811.119999999999
the really dusty smoggy cities in China

8809.56 --> 8815.199999999999
big ones

8811.12 --> 8816.58
India should bloody hell do that right

8815.2 --> 8819.04
away

8816.58 --> 8821.92
they really need that in their mix it's

8819.04 --> 8824.52
not expensive to even do that

8821.92 --> 8827.5
it's a very smart system

8824.52 --> 8831.460000000001
India absolutely should have those

8827.5 --> 8834.58
mechanisms to filter dust out of the air

8831.46 --> 8838.679999999998
it would dramatically improve

8834.58 --> 8838.68
the living quality in India

8853.62 --> 8860.2
irony of wheat scrubbing poison

8856.78 --> 8864.479000000001
then adding it to the yeah yeah I know

8860.2 --> 8864.479000000001
it is very ironic what's up

8865.66 --> 8870.119999999999
and you're talking about fluoride sodium

8870.819 --> 8874.08
fluorite right

8874.42 --> 8879.460000000001
or

8876.18 --> 8882.819
fluorosilicic acid as it's also called

8879.46 --> 8884.14
yeah that's like gotten out of scrubbing

8882.819 --> 8887.8
from

8884.14 --> 8889.42
I think is it coal

8887.8 --> 8890.699999999999
fertilizer

8889.42 --> 8894.76
[Music]

8890.7 --> 8896.979000000001
certain types of industrial Mining and

8894.76 --> 8899.2
then they refine it and then like that

8896.979 --> 8900.938999999998
crap shows up

8899.2 --> 8905.08
and that's what they have to scrub out

8900.939 --> 8908.319
of it it's like pollutant that's just in

8905.08 --> 8912.52
that type of dug up material typically

8908.319 --> 8916.119999999999
aluminum effortless right also

8912.52 --> 8919.12
right it's a standard side product there

8916.12 --> 8921.220000000001
but also just when they remind certain

8919.12 --> 8924.28
raw materials

8921.22 --> 8926.38
they also get that goop

8924.28 --> 8929.58
in there

8926.38 --> 8929.58
it's concrete yeah

8930.76 --> 8938.02
yeah that's the concentrated stuff so

8933.04 --> 8940.6
but it's just a hyper toxic chemical

8938.02 --> 8942.640000000001
used as rat poison in the 19th century

8940.6 --> 8943.84
they stopped using it because it was too

8942.64 --> 8947.039999999999
toxic

8943.84 --> 8947.04
it's like dangerous

8947.92 --> 8952.78
like if you like have rat poison and

8951.04 --> 8954.819000000001
they would use it like yeah yeah I got a

8952.78 --> 8957.1
black and then you just take a scoop and

8954.819 --> 8959.38
you put it like

8957.1 --> 8960.640000000001
and then you stick a piece of meat in it

8959.38 --> 8963.88
or something right

8960.64 --> 8966.699999999999
well if you'd literally like got like

8963.88 --> 8968.5
you take a scoop and then oops and then

8966.7 --> 8970.84
you throw it in the air and it like

8968.5 --> 8973.78
dusts around and you breathe some in it

8970.84 --> 8977.399
you could literally die on the spot

8973.78 --> 8977.399000000001
it's that [ __ ] dangerous

8977.68 --> 8981.54
so that's why they forbid it

8981.58 --> 8986.859
like it's not they don't use that for a

8985.18 --> 8989.28
rat poison anymore because it's just too

8986.859 --> 8989.28
dangerous

8990.76 --> 8996.939
and like if you if it's not

8994.479 --> 8999.34
like you also just pollute the ground if

8996.939 --> 9001.68
you just have that rat poison fluoride

8999.34 --> 9003.359
and it like it rains and then it just

9001.68 --> 9006.859
goes in the ground well that ground is

9003.359 --> 9006.859
now incredibly polluted

9013.8 --> 9022.34
because the sodium fluoride doesn't like

9017.88 --> 9022.339999999998
it doesn't break down naturally

9022.5 --> 9026.939
right a lot of chemicals react with the

9025.92 --> 9029.7
environment

9026.939 --> 9031.34
and then they kind of break down

9029.7 --> 9033.960000000001
into

9031.34 --> 9036.899
materials that nature can assimilate

9033.96 --> 9040.399
that's what typically happens a lot but

9036.899 --> 9043.439
some substances are so chemically

9040.399 --> 9046.22
alien from life that they just they

9043.439 --> 9046.220000000001
don't break down

9048.6 --> 9055.819
and yeah fluorosilicic acid is one of

9051.96 --> 9060.319
those toxins like it's so

9055.819 --> 9060.319
anti-life it just doesn't break down

9068.42 --> 9073.460000000001
right anyway I hope you guys are

9070.5 --> 9077.3
enjoying the stream thus far

9073.46 --> 9077.3
at two and a half hours

9092.88 --> 9097.438999999998
please support me through the PayPal

9094.859 --> 9100.92
it'll be great I really do still need it

9097.439 --> 9103.5
any support would be really helpful

9100.92 --> 9105.859
I'm already having issues just paying my

9103.5 --> 9105.859
bills

9106.02 --> 9111.720000000001
I really wish I'd get more regular

9108.18 --> 9113.7
support like I used to in the days where

9111.72 --> 9115.8
it really worked out for me and I could

9113.7 --> 9118.16
actually like have a little Surplus

9115.8 --> 9121.199999999999
every now and then to like get something

9118.16 --> 9124.56
like how I was able to get my microphone

9121.2 --> 9129.0
was because I did get support

9124.56 --> 9132.24
and it did give me Surplus

9129.0 --> 9134.96
now I mostly need support just to not

9132.24 --> 9134.96
starve

9135.359 --> 9139.399000000001
and that's not an exaggeration

9139.8 --> 9148.14
well yeah I mean I am managing though

9142.56 --> 9148.14
and I do get good dinners periodically

9149.76 --> 9154.439
but I I definitely need a little bit

9152.04 --> 9156.720000000001
more support and I hope that I'll be

9154.439 --> 9159.18
worth it

9156.72 --> 9162.38
I mean are you not entertained are you

9159.18 --> 9165.18
not learning things are you not

9162.38 --> 9168.42
stimulated intellectually

9165.18 --> 9170.58
that I am that's what I intend to do

9168.42 --> 9172.2
with my shows that's what I'm aiming for

9170.58 --> 9175.819
doing

9172.2 --> 9175.819000000001
intellectual stimulation

9177.84 --> 9184.859
letting you touch upon ideas and

9180.12 --> 9184.859
structures that are very durable

9185.88 --> 9192.179999999998
ready for assimilation

9188.34 --> 9197.460000000001
if you're up for that like if you're

9192.18 --> 9200.42
capable or ready for said simulator

9197.46 --> 9200.419999999998
a simulation

9203.22 --> 9206.96
so yeah please support me

9207.24 --> 9211.699999999999
PayPal link is in the description box

9214.2 --> 9216.740000000002
right

9217.7 --> 9224.1
just it's my email address rwin33

9221.76 --> 9226.880000000001
gmail.com

9224.1 --> 9226.880000000001
just do that

9228.0 --> 9233.28
like use that as a Target

9231.18 --> 9235.5
for the PayPal and you'll get the right

9233.28 --> 9237.060000000001
one so the PayPal address that's linked

9235.5 --> 9238.5
to my email address the same email

9237.06 --> 9242.96
address that's linked to my YouTube

9238.5 --> 9242.96
channel that's my PayPal address

9243.899 --> 9249.119999999999
please support me including if you're

9246.899 --> 9251.16
what if you're not live now here in the

9249.12 --> 9253.380000000001
chat and you're watching afterward I

9251.16 --> 9255.06
really need support to keep going

9253.38 --> 9258.3
I think there's plenty of people

9255.06 --> 9261.119999999999
watching my show when it isn't live

9258.3 --> 9263.46
that are still very interested in what I

9261.12 --> 9265.380000000001
talk about I do bump into people that

9263.46 --> 9267.479
just say that they're real big fans and

9265.38 --> 9270.858999999999
[ __ ] even though I don't recognize them

9267.479 --> 9270.858999999999
and so that does happen

9270.87 --> 9276.0
[Music]

9272.479 --> 9276.96
and I'm hoping to get support of those

9276.0 --> 9279.899
people

9276.96 --> 9281.938999999998
as well and I do sometimes sometimes I

9279.899 --> 9283.74
get little paypals from people that I

9281.939 --> 9287.220000000001
just don't know

9283.74 --> 9290.18
and I'm asking please keep it coming

9287.22 --> 9290.179999999998
because I need it

9292.62 --> 9296.460000000001
also yeah there is this relation you

9295.62 --> 9298.979000000001
know

9296.46 --> 9300.358999999999
I'm noticing I've eaten pretty well in

9298.979 --> 9303.119999999999
the last week

9300.359 --> 9306.24
and also because I got more hungry well

9303.12 --> 9309.899000000001
when I get more hungry I perform better

9306.24 --> 9312.66
also but it literally costs more food

9309.899 --> 9315.18
which costs more money so there's

9312.66 --> 9317.52
literally this direct relation here if I

9315.18 --> 9321.06
get more support I'll be able to buy

9317.52 --> 9324.12
more food which will keep making me

9321.06 --> 9326.16
perform better

9324.12 --> 9329.1
now if I don't get

9326.16 --> 9332.399
more support then I will end up eating

9329.1 --> 9334.56
less and then the quality that's going

9332.399 --> 9338.699999999999
to come out of me will be less on

9334.56 --> 9341.039999999999
average and that's just a practical fact

9338.7 --> 9343.26
I'd really like to keep up this high

9341.04 --> 9344.52
level I mean I've been working at it for

9343.26 --> 9347.16
a while

9344.52 --> 9349.5
for a couple of years now on a daily

9347.16 --> 9352.74
basis

9349.5 --> 9354.78
I really hope that the support would

9352.74 --> 9357.92
have gone up

9354.78 --> 9357.92
like equally

9358.2 --> 9363.359
unfortunately the entire world is going

9360.66 --> 9365.88
through like this

9363.359 --> 9368.18
Financial clampdown so I get it it's

9365.88 --> 9368.179999999998
tough

9371.88 --> 9376.88
what

9373.28 --> 9376.880000000001
cut my hours

9378.42 --> 9383.460000000001
this is less than 200 a week

9381.479 --> 9386.96
the [ __ ]

9383.46 --> 9386.96
that's not even a full salary

9388.979 --> 9395.849
that's not good Letter's age

9391.87 --> 9395.849
[Music]

9401.58 --> 9408.2
how did that happen is there any way

9403.56 --> 9408.199999999999
that you can like make up for lost hours

9410.77 --> 9413.87
[Music]

9423.06 --> 9430.819
oh thank you flatterson I appreciate

9425.1 --> 9430.819
that I appreciate that vouch voucher

9432.359 --> 9437.399000000001
right so yeah I'm definitely gonna wish

9434.939 --> 9440.7
you the best of luck with that

9437.399 --> 9443.06
job interview on Sunday my way but

9440.7 --> 9443.060000000001
whatever

9444.479 --> 9447.56
I hope it works out

9450.42 --> 9454.1
and I'm sure you're gonna tell me

9453.18 --> 9456.54
tomorrow

9454.1 --> 9459.0
[Music]

9456.54 --> 9462.84
but yeah I think I'm gonna maneuver

9459.0 --> 9465.3
somewhere to rounding out the show

9462.84 --> 9467.7
I actually had there's like this

9465.3 --> 9470.759999999998
building meeting

9467.7 --> 9473.76
or like like a

9470.76 --> 9476.34
social call thing and I'm sort of

9473.76 --> 9478.74
invited there so I'm gonna go talk to

9476.34 --> 9483.2
these people of this building I don't

9478.74 --> 9483.199999999999
know about what it might be very boring

9484.62 --> 9490.08
but like I've never actually really

9486.78 --> 9492.720000000001
talked to these people so it's like I

9490.08 --> 9494.76
just have to kind of show up

9492.72 --> 9498.08
and see like what they're going to be

9494.76 --> 9498.08
like if they're gonna like

9499.38 --> 9503.699999999999
connect with me not connect if they're

9501.66 --> 9505.56
gonna try to push something on me that

9503.7 --> 9507.66
they had trouble confronting me with and

9505.56 --> 9510.359
they only felt confident enough with a

9507.66 --> 9512.16
lot of people being present there

9510.359 --> 9513.78
like maybe they're gonna do that I

9512.16 --> 9516.72
probably not

9513.78 --> 9520.859
that would be very weird if they did

9516.72 --> 9523.08
that I should not be so paranoia

9520.859 --> 9524.939
but uh

9523.08 --> 9527.46
yeah I'm gonna do that

9524.939 --> 9531.439
like somewhere in the next hour

9527.46 --> 9531.438999999998
so I think I'm gonna round out

9534.6 --> 9538.640000000001
let me check PayPal one more time

9539.52 --> 9542.479000000001
nope

9551.0 --> 9555.72
yeah by the way yeah blue for killed

9553.62 --> 9558.359
Evolutions talking about the shoreline

9555.72 --> 9561.179999999998
and it doesn't change yeah

9558.359 --> 9563.28
and all these stinky rich people that

9561.18 --> 9566.0
all are partaking part in the climate

9563.28 --> 9566.0
change hoax

9566.22 --> 9574.08
in the scam they all got beach

9569.28 --> 9576.720000000001
properties it's like it's their thing

9574.08 --> 9580.319
it's almost like they have like oh you

9576.72 --> 9583.619999999999
are a climate change advocate

9580.319 --> 9586.439
and you're rich well we're only gonna

9583.62 --> 9589.220000000001
take you serious if you have a house at

9586.439 --> 9589.220000000001
the beach somewhere

9589.8 --> 9595.679999999998
it's like it's like you have to do that

9593.64 --> 9597.0
it's like if you don't get a Beach

9595.68 --> 9601.220000000001
property

9597.0 --> 9601.22
like you can't be part of our scam

9605.28 --> 9611.460000000001
I think that actually might be a thing

9609.06 --> 9613.26
it's like it's a devil scam and if you

9611.46 --> 9616.679999999998
want to be part of it then you have to

9613.26 --> 9619.08
be hyper hypocritical you must have a

9616.68 --> 9621.720000000001
beachfront property or we're not going

9619.08 --> 9623.7
to take you serious you you we won't let

9621.72 --> 9626.96
you into the game

9623.7 --> 9626.960000000001
if you don't do that

9631.68 --> 9635.819
I think that might be going on

9634.2 --> 9638.04
I think that

9635.819 --> 9641.34
with some of these mind controlling

9638.04 --> 9643.740000000002
scams you have to like virtue signal

9641.34 --> 9648.0
with your hypocrisy or you won't be let

9643.74 --> 9650.88
in you're like basically have to prove

9648.0 --> 9653.78
that you know it's not real or you can't

9650.88 --> 9653.779999999999
partake in it

9672.72 --> 9677.64
there's a lot more money in the budget

9675.96 --> 9680.46
okay

9677.64 --> 9685.14
so is there not another

9680.46 --> 9688.199999999999
job that you could do on like in between

9685.14 --> 9688.93
that so yeah I'll leave it to you but I

9688.2 --> 9690.300000000001
mean

9688.93 --> 9692.78
[Music]

9690.3 --> 9692.779999999999
uh

9716.76 --> 9721.979
right but anyway look theoretically

9719.24 --> 9724.26
conceptually not actually

9721.979 --> 9726.0
even if the ocean would rise I'd still

9724.26 --> 9729.12
invest in Hawaii

9726.0 --> 9731.28
because there's a lot of volcanoes there

9729.12 --> 9733.319000000001
which means that oh even if the ocean

9731.28 --> 9736.7
does rise there's still got to be more

9733.319 --> 9736.699999999999
land being created there

9736.979 --> 9739.46
right

9741.359 --> 9747.960000000001
like over time even if the oceans would

9744.96 --> 9751.46
rise it would eventually turn back into

9747.96 --> 9751.46
a decently sized Island

9751.979 --> 9759.319
but anyway it's not relevant because the

9754.74 --> 9759.319
ocean isn't going to rise it never does

9778.14 --> 9784.14
right because ocean levels don't rise

9781.2 --> 9787.439
what does happen however is that big

9784.14 --> 9791.519999999999
waves happen big waves do happen

9787.439 --> 9795.2
the water level rising doesn't happen

9791.52 --> 9795.2
but big wave do happen

9796.979 --> 9802.679999999998
like when entire pieces of ocean floor

9799.68 --> 9804.899
break off all of a sudden or get blown

9802.68 --> 9808.14
up who knows

9804.899 --> 9811.14
yeah then a tsunami a giant displacement

9808.14 --> 9814.858999999999
of water might happen

9811.14 --> 9817.26
but the actual level at rest of the

9814.859 --> 9820.819
water is not going to change

9817.26 --> 9820.819
that will remain the same

9830.46 --> 9834.599999999999
right anyhow

9832.62 --> 9836.880000000001
I'm gonna run out

9834.6 --> 9838.859
