Arwin

90.439 --> 97.19999999999999
right weather

93.6 --> 97.19999999999999
today it's kind of

99.759 --> 107.719
nice it's not like super blue sky

104.479 --> 110.96
there's still clouds everywhere

107.719 --> 112.36
but and some trails that are being left

110.96 --> 115.719
it

112.36 --> 118.84
seems but yeah there's some nice sun

115.719 --> 121.439
and seems almost wind

118.84 --> 123.71900000000001
still

121.439 --> 126.479
that's kind of a nice and peaceful type

123.719 --> 126.479
of day out

136.44 --> 139.599
there all

142.12 --> 146.84
right hello isg first in chat good to

145.28 --> 151.76
see

146.84 --> 151.76
you you're in quick

152.08 --> 158.36
it is Thursday the 1st of February

161.12 --> 168.04
2024 temperature is probably like 7°

164.92 --> 168.04
again or 8 degrees

172.64 --> 175.64
Celsius

176.76 --> 181.76
yep

178.76 --> 181.76
right

181.959 --> 189.28
oh man I'm slightly wonky cuz I just

186.04 --> 193.79899999999998
went to bed so damn late

189.28 --> 193.799
yesterday like I shouldn't be doing

194.319 --> 199.83999999999997
that hey clutch good to see you got some

198.28 --> 203.64000000000001
good

199.84 --> 206.159
news oh okay that great to hear

203.64 --> 208.67999999999998
that was barely hearing anything from

206.159 --> 211.67999999999998
you

208.68 --> 211.68
recently

212.879 --> 219.239
yeah well glad to hear that's starting

214.72 --> 219.239
to work out for you whatever it

224.959 --> 231.079
is but yeah yesterday

228.4 --> 233.92000000000002
night own Benjamin was great and

231.079 --> 236.0
everything but I was just very restless

233.92 --> 239.72
yesterday stayed

236.0 --> 242.0
up and then started watching uh the

239.72 --> 244.64
machine lies again it always starts at

242.0 --> 249.439
3:00 at night so it

244.64 --> 249.439
just but it was kind of entertaining and

252.959 --> 258.6
hilarious again so I kind of stuck

255.72 --> 259.759
around and then I remembered oh [ __ ]

258.6 --> 263.08000000000004
Richard

259.759 --> 264.28000000000003
G gave me a link to this amazing video

263.08 --> 266.84
on

264.28 --> 270.11999999999995
bito I did post it in the Flat Earth

266.84 --> 272.039
early bir chat so think both of you

270.12 --> 277.639
would have been able to see

272.039 --> 277.639
it the new part two the new

279.0 --> 286.72
biology from Dr Steven

282.4 --> 291.12
Lanka and it's like English

286.72 --> 295.639
uh overs spoken English

291.12 --> 298.28000000000003
narrated so yeah man that thing is just

295.639 --> 298.28000000000003
so

298.56 --> 303.6
intense

301.44 --> 306.88
I only watched part of it last night and

303.6 --> 306.88
watched the rest of it this

308.16 --> 313.52000000000004
morning but there's like so much

311.0 --> 317.12
information it it's just

313.52 --> 321.71999999999997
like it kind of hurts it's

317.12 --> 326.56
so so much damn it but like it's good

321.72 --> 330.199
I'm glad but my damn it so much and also

326.56 --> 331.6
it was or Richard G noticed

330.199 --> 334.8
about

331.6 --> 336.88
it that there's a weird entanglement

334.8 --> 340.28000000000003
Claim about gravity in there which like

336.88 --> 340.28
makes no sense it's

340.36 --> 346.44
not it doesn't actually get into physics

343.639 --> 350.08
so what I personally think about that is

346.44 --> 353.16
that the guy probably tried

350.08 --> 358.28
to put a little wizard trick

353.16 --> 361.40000000000003
there because he knows gravity is

358.28 --> 365.599
basically a work in progress

361.4 --> 368.479
that's potentially never

365.599 --> 370.44
resolved he may have like inserted

368.479 --> 372.08
gravity as like oh and this thing is

370.44 --> 374.28
what causes

372.08 --> 377.4
gravity just

374.28 --> 380.67999999999995
to just to get a lot of people's

377.4 --> 383.67999999999995
attention on like oh maybe this is worth

380.68 --> 386.039
researching kind of I think it was a

383.68 --> 390.319
little wizard trick I mean the guy is

386.039 --> 392.96
so you have to be absolutely

390.319 --> 398.16
brilliant to be able to like put down

392.96 --> 398.15999999999997
everything that he put down with that

399.919 --> 406.96
understanding and it just felt like he

404.199 --> 410.0
didn't really get into gravity he just

406.96 --> 412.71999999999997
like kind of tried to use it as a hook

410.0 --> 414.68
pulled NASA in there too it seemed kind

412.72 --> 419.12
of out of

414.68 --> 421.639
place but it just felt like it was an a

419.12 --> 424.8
for ement

421.639 --> 427.8
trick that try to hook people that's

424.8 --> 430.199
that's my first impression of that but

427.8 --> 431.879
the overall thing is just astounding the

430.199 --> 435.56
amount of

431.879 --> 438.47900000000004
like completely different biological

435.56 --> 441.08
knowledge that he presents here like

438.479 --> 446.479
I

441.08 --> 450.68
H I literally have to like watch it

446.479 --> 454.87899999999996
again it's like to be able to explain

450.68 --> 454.879
all that is like a is a proper

457.12 --> 463.919
challenge but I mean it

460.96 --> 466.96
is it's very real and

463.919 --> 469.35999999999996
it's fascinating and important it's just

466.96 --> 469.35999999999996
like

469.479 --> 476.71999999999997
so so counter opposite of of how we

473.12 --> 480.8
learn biology and the funny thing is is

476.72 --> 483.8
that I basically already explained those

480.8 --> 487.8
aspects about it when I bring up things

483.8 --> 490.12
with German medicine but really my

487.8 --> 493.0
biological knowledge of the actual

490.12 --> 495.0
cellular details and what they do and

493.0 --> 499.24
like how this guy explained like I'm not

495.0 --> 503.039
even like I maybe at like 10% and that's

499.24 --> 503.039
already very really impressive to

503.8 --> 508.159
me I don't see myself ever

508.24 --> 514.2
becoming

510.36 --> 517.839
as knowledgeable as that guy about

514.2 --> 520.399
it but hey I never thought

517.839 --> 522.08
I

520.399 --> 525.48
what I

522.08 --> 528.9200000000001
never felt like I would be able to

525.48 --> 533.2
achieve like the insights that I have by

528.92 --> 533.1999999999999
now as well so maybe give it more

535.399 --> 543.0
time it seems like as time passes for me

539.04 --> 546.0
like complications like have a half life

543.0 --> 548.6
over a certain period of time like when

546.0 --> 550.92
I was young it seemed like completely

548.6 --> 555.839
unattainable unassailable is a better

550.92 --> 559.56
word for it like it's too much but

555.839 --> 562.8800000000001
then the first glance complications over

559.56 --> 565.1999999999999
time it's like the details that aren't

562.88 --> 568.12
important about it slide in the

565.2 --> 569.9200000000001
background while the

568.12 --> 572.92
actual

569.92 --> 575.3199999999999
over structure of it becomes more and

572.92 --> 578.079
more apparent stands out to me over time

575.32 --> 580.0
and then by the over structure that I

578.079 --> 584.04
basically Spot

580.0 --> 586.44
It by just like staring at the knowledge

584.04 --> 588.519
as a whole then eventually the over

586.44 --> 590.7600000000001
structure start to sink in and then

588.519 --> 593.6
that's what I go with that's how I've

590.76 --> 596.56
been building all my knowledge

593.6 --> 598.399
here and that might happen with this too

596.56 --> 600.3199999999999
but I'm like really impressed like I

598.399 --> 602.519
didn't know

600.32 --> 606.6400000000001
like medical knowledge had already

602.519 --> 606.64
developed that far within

606.92 --> 610.519
this alternate

610.88 --> 614.92
approach then again I should have

613.12 --> 617.279
expected that because these guys are

614.92 --> 619.959
like in their golden age of intellectual

617.279 --> 623.16
development with this and that was

619.959 --> 623.16
already like 10 years

623.56 --> 630.0
ago on which I base my kind of knowledge

627.44 --> 632.399
level in that direction but I mean they

630.0 --> 634.839
had 10 years to like NeverEnding

632.399 --> 637.32
development and on their level so it's

634.839 --> 642.1600000000001
like yeah I shouldn't be surprised that

637.32 --> 642.1600000000001
they've gotten this far it's

643.279 --> 647.76
amazing right so I was really impressed

645.68 --> 649.88
by that video if you haven't checked it

647.76 --> 654.959
out definitely do it but make sure you

649.88 --> 659.16
got a really clear mind when you do this

654.959 --> 661.6389999999999
is not some oh I'll just I'll just have

659.16 --> 664.279
glance it or something dude it will just

661.639 --> 666.2
be complete Abracadabra to you but

664.279 --> 668.2
you'll probably not be capable even

666.2 --> 670.48
doing that because it'll just like Snap

668.2 --> 673.9590000000001
you out of it continually it's like what

670.48 --> 677.44
what what that what that and that and

673.959 --> 677.4399999999999
that and that and that

678.399 --> 681.639
what right

687.36 --> 692.48
anyway so yeah

690.0 --> 692.48
Rudolph

692.519 --> 700.36
Steiner German new medicine like he drew

696.0 --> 702.72
Dr Hammer in with his research like in

700.36 --> 705.72
this video it's like

702.72 --> 707.6
everything it's almost

705.72 --> 710.279
like a

707.6 --> 713.399
summary of like the knowledge I've

710.279 --> 717.0
managed to assimilate plus a whole bunch

713.399 --> 717.0
more that fit in between that

717.959 --> 725.399
perfectly it's just really

721.88 --> 728.519
fresh I haven't mastered it yet hey

725.399 --> 732.6
Richard G I was just talking about the

728.519 --> 732.6
amazing video you shared with me

732.8 --> 736.68
yesterday really really

747.88 --> 750.88
impressive

751.68 --> 754.04
right

754.12 --> 759.399
anyhow got to watch it again yeah me too

757.199 --> 762.639
I mean this is like something you got to

759.399 --> 766.199
watch like three times at least before

762.639 --> 768.199
you get a good feel of it probably it's

766.199 --> 772.079
so

768.199 --> 774.76
much like he shows things say so

772.079 --> 777.6389999999999
succinct but there's so much he's like

774.76 --> 780.199
almost like rushing through it all it's

777.639 --> 782.839
like everything is like oh here's a new

780.199 --> 787.079
completely Revelation oh this and that

782.839 --> 789.44
and that and that H this is how it is

787.079 --> 791.399
move on to the next thing like who you

789.44 --> 793.9590000000001
get 30 seconds like a complete

791.399 --> 795.959
Revelation and just like really succinct

793.959 --> 800.7199999999999
explanation but and then now another

795.959 --> 800.7199999999999
like whoa whoa keeps

805.079 --> 810.76
going but yeah I

807.76 --> 813.16
mean the English narration from the

810.76 --> 816.199
spacebusters guys certainly is very

813.16 --> 820.079
helpful I mean I would be completely

816.199 --> 820.079
lost if I had to decipher that in

820.72 --> 824.72
German just because of all the The

823.16 --> 827.7199999999999
Specialist

824.72 --> 827.72
words

830.32 --> 833.639
alone all right

837.759 --> 840.759
anyhow

849.72 --> 853.32
tried watching it

853.959 --> 857.3599999999999
just without

859.12 --> 862.12
subtitles

865.88 --> 873.24
yeah wait just with subtitles so without

869.16 --> 873.24
sound yeah that sounds very

873.68 --> 880.079
difficult I mean space Buster guys like

876.399 --> 881.6
really noses inflections like to help

880.079 --> 884.56
you

881.6 --> 887.12
focus so just reading it is much more

884.56 --> 887.1199999999999
difficult I can

897.68 --> 900.68
imagine

947.759 --> 953.44
right so yeah I'm kind of filled up

950.36 --> 953.44
spiritually with this

955.36 --> 960.36
video I didn't actually check out

957.92 --> 963.68
anything else yet so I'm going to look

960.36 --> 963.6800000000001
around for a bit what's going

986.279 --> 990.519
on oh okay

1017.48 --> 1020.48
for

1039.36 --> 1046.319
the gel state of water yes the vortex of

1042.199 --> 1049.4
the heart I wasn't expecting that I

1046.319 --> 1051.6399999999999
was that was totally expecting that to

1049.4 --> 1054.0800000000002
be part of it I mean that's part of that

1051.64 --> 1058.48
type of research remember the Greg Reese

1054.08 --> 1060.3999999999999
video about that just about that subject

1058.48 --> 1063.919
like yeah

1060.4 --> 1067.3200000000002
that's that's among what these

1063.919 --> 1069.3200000000002
alternative biological researches are

1067.32 --> 1072.28
occupying themselves

1069.32 --> 1074.52
with I totally expected

1072.28 --> 1077.28
that and also interesting that

1074.52 --> 1079.36
apparently there are now artificial

1077.28 --> 1082.039
hearts that don't p

1079.36 --> 1084.039
pump but that are that are literally

1082.039 --> 1087.1589999999999
creating

1084.039 --> 1090.32
vortices instead so it's like a pump

1087.159 --> 1092.7990000000002
artificial heart and it creates a vesy

1090.32 --> 1092.799
and that

1094.12 --> 1098.6
works

1096.679 --> 1101.4
apparently really

1098.6 --> 1103.7199999999998
interesting I had no idea that like

1101.4 --> 1106.24
there might be now actual artificial

1103.72 --> 1109.2
Hearts thanks to

1106.24 --> 1110.52
that they basically adap aped the

1109.2 --> 1113.28
understanding of the heart and instead

1110.52 --> 1116.039
of creating an artificial pump they made

1113.28 --> 1119.6789999999999
a Vortex machine because that's how they

1116.039 --> 1119.679
identify the heart

1120.6 --> 1124.08
now isn't that

1125.799 --> 1131.039
interesting yeah gel state of water and

1129.0 --> 1134.44
oh my God all that

1131.039 --> 1137.12
intracellular stuff like the bacteria

1134.44 --> 1140.0
layers and it's like yeah it's like

1137.12 --> 1142.52
still giving me like a headache overdose

1140.0 --> 1145.48
in information

1142.52 --> 1150.1589999999999
overdose giving me a information

1145.48 --> 1150.159
overdose headache switching my words

1156.48 --> 1163.24
around but it was very interesting to

1159.96 --> 1166.76
note to take notice that like several of

1163.24 --> 1168.799
these subjects were all familiar to

1166.76 --> 1170.36
me well find

1168.799 --> 1173.0
who gives a

1170.36 --> 1177.3999999999999
oh I'm just immediately going to kick

1173.0 --> 1177.4
that out don't give a

1183.44 --> 1186.44
[ __ ]

1189.84 --> 1195.08
anyway yeah and to prevent this from

1193.12 --> 1197.6789999999999
happening I'd really appreciate if

1195.08 --> 1200.6
everybody present especially the ones

1197.679 --> 1200.6000000000001
that have a French

1201.679 --> 1208.64
would kind of

1204.36 --> 1210.3999999999999
like say stuff I mean you don't have to

1208.64 --> 1212.64
like continually be at the keyboard or

1210.4 --> 1214.919
anything but especially if there's like

1212.64 --> 1216.4
and you can see this having a wrench if

1214.919 --> 1219.1200000000001
there's like

1216.4 --> 1222.3600000000001
trolls trying to shove themselves in the

1219.12 --> 1226.2399999999998
chat it's great if you then don't leave

1222.36 --> 1229.36
a lot of deleted messages to fill up the

1226.24 --> 1232.08
chat and just like say a couple of

1229.36 --> 1236.12
things like that

1232.08 --> 1236.12
helps prevent like

1236.799 --> 1239.799
a

1243.919 --> 1250.0
congestion what I'm saying is sounds

1246.679 --> 1252.0800000000002
weird a lot of deleted messages from

1250.0 --> 1255.88
obvious

1252.08 --> 1255.8799999999999
trolls is bad for

1256.24 --> 1261.039
morale not the deleting them part but

1258.96 --> 1263.08
just that being there it's like oh

1261.039 --> 1266.08
you're staring at a lot of dead

1263.08 --> 1266.08
trolls

1266.84 --> 1272.6399999999999
uh it's not very

1269.64 --> 1272.64
appealing

1276.96 --> 1282.44
anyway satation say the heart is a

1287.039 --> 1290.039
bump

1294.84 --> 1302.76
there's also citations that say that the

1297.44 --> 1306.3600000000001
sun is closer during the winter than it

1302.76 --> 1306.36
is during the

1307.799 --> 1311.0
springtime all

1311.36 --> 1317.6789999999999
right that doesn't make it true it's

1314.799 --> 1319.039
just I ask for recitation from people

1317.679 --> 1322.8400000000001
sometimes

1319.039 --> 1322.84
when I think they're making something

1327.36 --> 1336.32
up it's like is this like an actual idea

1332.559 --> 1340.84
that's what that question is

1336.32 --> 1343.6
about right like I want them to be

1340.84 --> 1346.0
honest about whether they attained it as

1343.6 --> 1348.039
an information that is actually out

1346.0 --> 1350.679
there or whether they were just

1348.039 --> 1353.36
improvising making it up like I demand

1350.679 --> 1356.64
Clarity to that and that's why I ask a

1353.36 --> 1360.799
citation if people ask me for a citation

1356.64 --> 1363.279
sometimes when I go on more wild

1360.799 --> 1364.6
speculation holographic celestials how

1363.279 --> 1367.559
that's supposed to

1364.6 --> 1369.9599999999998
work then if people ask me citation I'll

1367.559 --> 1373.08
say yeah I'm the citation because I'm

1369.96 --> 1375.44
literally making this up as I go I'm

1373.08 --> 1378.84
trying to figure it out as I

1375.44 --> 1382.0
go there is no citation right but I'm

1378.84 --> 1384.76
not going to like oh no no what I'm

1382.0 --> 1389.6
talking about is very scientific it's

1384.76 --> 1391.799
all proven really other people also

1389.6 --> 1398.8799999999999
understand this no because that would be

1391.799 --> 1398.8799999999999
a lie I'm not going to try to force my

1400.12 --> 1406.32
ideas under guys

1403.08 --> 1409.8799999999999
of them already being accepted or

1406.32 --> 1409.8799999999999
something like no

1416.1 --> 1419.1699999999998
[Music]

1421.039 --> 1427.32
right I don't even know why I banned

1423.679 --> 1430.4
that problem wasn't even

1427.32 --> 1431.9189999999999
necessary I just addressed it that's

1430.4 --> 1434.039
good

1431.919 --> 1436.88
enough right I'm going to take a bite

1434.039 --> 1439.8799999999999
out of my Illuminati C on here

1436.88 --> 1439.88
cheers

1466.799 --> 1469.799
okay

1470.6 --> 1475.84
it's really fascinating too by the way

1472.799 --> 1475.84
Richard G in this

1476.76 --> 1485.1589999999999
video how it's yeah going into the

1481.279 --> 1485.159
German new medicine Dr Hammer's

1486.039 --> 1493.559
work and showing the actual brain

1490.36 --> 1495.9599999999998
trauma that correlates with

1493.559 --> 1498.96
certain

1495.96 --> 1501.039
disease which like he even like rewords

1498.96 --> 1504.88
it like they are

1501.039 --> 1504.8799999999999
like what do they call it

1509.039 --> 1515.52
again like specific resolving program

1513.76 --> 1518.6
programs I don't know exactly what he

1515.52 --> 1522.0
called it but like don't even see it as

1518.6 --> 1524.1589999999999
like oh this is a damage or the

1522.0 --> 1527.399
degeneration like no there's specific

1524.159 --> 1529.2
programs to resolve specific types of

1527.399 --> 1532.32
conf

1529.2 --> 1534.799
conflicts so it's like almost like

1532.32 --> 1538.6789999999999
diseases in a way are almost considered

1534.799 --> 1541.9189999999999
as like federal emergency programs like

1538.679 --> 1541.919
oh something Extreme's

1542.159 --> 1550.3600000000001
happening the brain gets the hit

1545.679 --> 1553.0800000000002
like and then a COR directly correlating

1550.36 --> 1556.6789999999999
responding set of effects start

1553.08 --> 1559.6789999999999
happening with the associated

1556.679 --> 1559.679
region

1560.76 --> 1565.96
yeah it's

1561.88 --> 1568.24
amazing and it it gives further way also

1565.96 --> 1570.72
to my own

1568.24 --> 1573.159
ideas not call them theories my own

1570.72 --> 1577.88
ideas

1573.159 --> 1580.7600000000002
about how the nervous system is like

1577.88 --> 1582.5200000000002
not the thing that's like our

1580.76 --> 1586.52
Consciousness or even our spirit like

1582.52 --> 1589.84
it's a relay system it's like a registry

1586.52 --> 1592.12
and looking at like the whole conflict

1589.84 --> 1596.08
which is effectively would be considered

1592.12 --> 1598.52
like brain damage is just completely

1596.08 --> 1602.1589999999999
misunderstood like oh there's suddenly a

1598.52 --> 1602.1589999999999
hole there like what the

1602.32 --> 1606.799
hell yeah and it doesn't mean like oh I

1604.64 --> 1610.1200000000001
got a oh like a bullet in your brain or

1606.799 --> 1613.44
something like just like a hole appears

1610.12 --> 1615.84
there it just retracts well you're still

1613.44 --> 1618.48
like

1615.84 --> 1620.6789999999999
functioning like you haven't like

1618.48 --> 1622.48
altered your personality all of a sudden

1620.679 --> 1626.3200000000002
because there's this big hole somewhere

1622.48 --> 1628.799
in your brain literally it's a natural

1626.32 --> 1631.559
part of the processes and that's the

1628.799 --> 1634.039
weird thing is like yeah the brain and

1631.559 --> 1637.6789999999999
the nervous system isn't

1634.039 --> 1640.039
like a materialized condensed version of

1637.679 --> 1642.76
like your Consciousness and your spirit

1640.039 --> 1645.08
like from the materialist perspective it

1642.76 --> 1648.039
isn't that at all it's like a secondary

1645.08 --> 1650.799
thing that's like part of the

1648.039 --> 1653.8799999999999
registry

1650.799 --> 1657.32
system like it's

1653.88 --> 1660.159
the it's the library and the people with

1657.32 --> 1662.399
the paperwork the administration

1660.159 --> 1664.48
department like that's kind of like how

1662.399 --> 1666.84
I see the nervous system it's like the

1664.48 --> 1670.3600000000001
administration

1666.84 --> 1674.519
department yeah the administration

1670.36 --> 1678.4799999999998
department isn't the leadership

1674.519 --> 1680.84
they just like carry out the orders and

1678.48 --> 1683.279
organize

1680.84 --> 1687.48
things and that's how I see the nervous

1683.279 --> 1687.48
system originally like with my

1688.679 --> 1695.24
conceptions which also ties in with the

1692.0 --> 1699.2
notion that I brought up recently about

1695.24 --> 1701.76
how memory is not stored in the

1699.2 --> 1704.88
brain like a computer

1701.76 --> 1706.44
chip stores information like that's not

1704.88 --> 1708.7990000000002
happening in the brain at

1706.44 --> 1711.3600000000001
all

1708.799 --> 1715.76
could be more perceived as that the

1711.36 --> 1719.6
brain is like a translator

1715.76 --> 1722.279
receiver for the memory that is not in

1719.6 --> 1724.6
the brain so where is it then well what

1722.279 --> 1728.32
about if it's in your

1724.6 --> 1731.4399999999998
spirit like in the energy field whatever

1728.32 --> 1735.32
it is exactly like it's like almost

1731.44 --> 1738.48
stored like radio information maybe

1735.32 --> 1740.24
right radio is like

1738.48 --> 1744.519
encoded

1740.24 --> 1747.6
energy in a way right signals that are

1744.519 --> 1749.48
encoded with detail information well

1747.6 --> 1752.8799999999999
maybe the spirit is kind of like that

1749.48 --> 1755.3990000000001
it's almost like a radio

1752.88 --> 1758.7990000000002
signal that is like continually

1755.399 --> 1761.08
happening and that radio signal that is

1758.799 --> 1763.679
your spirit does like actual energy

1761.08 --> 1765.76
things whatever in the moment might also

1763.679 --> 1769.919
be the

1765.76 --> 1773.2
storage blueprint for your

1769.919 --> 1777.159
entire obviously inward

1773.2 --> 1779.0
encoded fractal memory of everything

1777.159 --> 1782.3990000000001
that you built

1779.0 --> 1784.679
up right so inward spiraling memory

1782.399 --> 1789.1589999999999
fractal the idea of it would

1784.679 --> 1791.76
be it starts with a circle and then like

1789.159 --> 1795.279
information is stored in an arm and the

1791.76 --> 1798.72
arm just like grows like a spiral inward

1795.279 --> 1800.799
and it's like infinite the potential

1798.72 --> 1802.76
length it could grow is infinite and the

1800.799 --> 1805.9189999999999
further it goes inward the smaller it

1802.76 --> 1810.2
becomes so it's like an infinite

1805.919 --> 1813.3200000000002
storage concept information storage

1810.2 --> 1817.1200000000001
infinitely well that might be like how

1813.32 --> 1821.48
that works with memory storage in the in

1817.12 --> 1824.9599999999998
the soul but to actually get the memory

1821.48 --> 1826.3990000000001
with your conscious to remember it all

1824.96 --> 1828.24
the things that you've experienced in

1826.399 --> 1830.2399999999998
something specific

1828.24 --> 1833.519
that's where you like need that brain

1830.24 --> 1837.44
part that is like a translator to tap

1833.519 --> 1840.0
into your spirit and get the right

1837.44 --> 1843.039
memory it's like the finder in the hard

1840.0 --> 1845.919
dis like we're in the spiral that like

1843.039 --> 1847.76
how accurate it can pinpoint the memory

1845.919 --> 1849.88
how quickly you can get the memory is

1847.76 --> 1852.64
like how well that memory translator

1849.88 --> 1856.24
part of your brain would be but the

1852.64 --> 1858.3600000000001
information itself of the memory

1856.24 --> 1863.96
like

1858.36 --> 1863.9599999999998
shouldn't be isn't stored in the brain

1865.919 --> 1872.3200000000002
itself water in me yeah well water

1868.88 --> 1876.0800000000002
contains memory so maybe maybe the

1872.32 --> 1879.24
memory through the spirit is like maybe

1876.08 --> 1882.12
that inward encryption effect is like in

1879.24 --> 1884.96
the cells is like the

1882.12 --> 1889.1589999999999
spirit determines the blueprint could be

1884.96 --> 1889.159
and then the water may be

1889.84 --> 1896.08
like endowed through the energy with it

1893.72 --> 1898.799
so maybe the memory is indeed in the

1896.08 --> 1898.799
water of your

1899.679 --> 1905.44
cells that is like radiated in there

1902.799 --> 1908.08
with the spirit maybe maybe seeking star

1905.44 --> 1911.3600000000001
it could be good to see you right

1908.08 --> 1915.48
away that I don't know yet

1911.36 --> 1918.08
man I'm free range speculating right now

1915.48 --> 1920.84
and it's really enjoyable I'm so happy

1918.08 --> 1924.84
that I don't have to restrict myself

1920.84 --> 1926.72
over Petty concerns of about mechanistic

1924.84 --> 1932.0
physics based

1926.72 --> 1936.76
science like but I'm still trying to

1932.0 --> 1940.88
orientate right I mean once solid enough

1936.76 --> 1943.639
systems theories ideas have been

1940.88 --> 1946.6390000000001
created that have touchdown points in

1943.639 --> 1949.4399999999998
reality like my example of like hey what

1946.639 --> 1953.84
about people

1949.44 --> 1956.0
having Hearts transplanted transplanted

1953.84 --> 1959.4399999999998
hearts and getting other memories like

1956.0 --> 1959.44
that's a lead that's

1960.84 --> 1968.4399999999998
a a touchdown point for my

1964.519 --> 1971.0
idea a correlation that might it might

1968.44 --> 1972.44
be eventually turning out to be an

1971.0 --> 1975.76
actual real

1972.44 --> 1979.919
proof of a not completely devised

1975.76 --> 1983.84
hypothesis yet or not at all

1979.919 --> 1986.0800000000002
right is still very much very early

1983.84 --> 1988.76
development and that can take a long

1986.08 --> 1991.039
time and can lead to absolutely nothing

1988.76 --> 1994.08
or it could lead to like really good

1991.039 --> 1998.519
solid long-term foundations of

1994.08 --> 1998.519
understanding hey dupons hey twit

2002.6 --> 2008.9599999999998
wit water has less memory than AO uh

2017.399 --> 2023.12
yeah it's the third show I talk about

2020.0 --> 2026.36
heart transplant yeah as a

2023.12 --> 2030.4399999999998
reference like I've heard those stories

2026.36 --> 2035.24
like I heard those stories in

2030.44 --> 2038.3200000000002
my hippie dippy paranormal face like oh

2035.24 --> 2040.32
past lives oh this kid remember the past

2038.32 --> 2042.76
life from this person like that sort of

2040.32 --> 2046.24
that's hippie dippy [ __ ] I mean it is

2042.76 --> 2050.159
sorry and that's cool it's awesome hey

2046.24 --> 2051.599
yeah I know I love it still but it is

2050.159 --> 2056.639
hippie dippy

2051.599 --> 2060.7200000000003
stuff and like like just that kind of

2056.639 --> 2063.359
like mystery stories and heart

2060.72 --> 2066.3199999999997
transplants getting memories from the

2063.359 --> 2068.679
person that over the heart was is part

2066.32 --> 2071.2400000000002
of that

2068.679 --> 2072.48
range of stories that I've heard so it's

2071.24 --> 2075.0789999999997
like

2072.48 --> 2078.119
hey they

2075.079 --> 2079.76
never they probably never thought of it

2078.119 --> 2084.0
like that they just thought it was

2079.76 --> 2086.48
something mystical spooky thing like oh

2084.0 --> 2089.079
a former form of your spirit or

2086.48 --> 2092.639
something never realizing like well

2089.079 --> 2095.8790000000004
maybe the heart actually has like more

2092.639 --> 2099.2400000000002
intcal function within the

2095.879 --> 2101.7599999999998
memory like the pedestal on which the

2099.24 --> 2104.24
memory rests and so that pedestal is

2101.76 --> 2107.48
going to kind of take that shape of of

2104.24 --> 2107.4799999999996
the whole of that memory

2107.8 --> 2118.44
and Echoes of it may appear in the other

2114.32 --> 2120.1600000000003
person as their Spirit now rests on this

2118.44 --> 2122.8
replacement heart which is already kind

2120.16 --> 2125.839
of miraculous that that's even possible

2122.8 --> 2128.8
really but I mean the body is absolutely

2125.839 --> 2128.7999999999997
miraculous

2129.839 --> 2136.2
so that's where I got that idea

2132.76 --> 2138.76
from I picked it up somewhere else then

2136.2 --> 2140.48
saw a connection that nobody ever

2138.76 --> 2144.28
thought

2140.48 --> 2147.52
of I like that yeah it's the way through

2144.28 --> 2150.3190000000004
it's digging in between finding those

2147.52 --> 2153.599
gems because nobody ever thought to dig

2150.319 --> 2155.4
there that's what I do that's what I

2153.599 --> 2159.4
pride myself

2155.4 --> 2159.4
doing and this is is one of those

2160.319 --> 2165.64
examples and a lot of times every time

2162.92 --> 2169.28
every time actually I do that people get

2165.64 --> 2171.2799999999997
really pissy and annoyed and ask for

2169.28 --> 2176.5600000000004
citations and all

2171.28 --> 2176.5600000000004
that because it's completely

2177.64 --> 2183.2799999999997
new I didn't find

2180.599 --> 2186.2000000000003
this on some video somewhere on the

2183.28 --> 2191.3190000000004
internet and I'm secretly not telling it

2186.2 --> 2191.319
yeah I figured it

2195.06 --> 2198.36
[Music]

2198.72 --> 2205.72
out look very relaxed today good VI yeah

2201.96 --> 2208.44
thanks no I I do feel good it's wet

2205.72 --> 2209.8799999999997
wet and it's kind of nice and sunny so

2208.44 --> 2213.2000000000003
that

2209.88 --> 2215.48
helps the trails seem to be not

2213.2 --> 2218.319
persistent up there which is also great

2215.48 --> 2221.079
because I hate it when it's all gray

2218.319 --> 2224.56
soupish it it's staying blue despite the

2221.079 --> 2227.2400000000002
trail so that's that makes me happy that

2224.56 --> 2229.52
gives me the feeling like haha there's a

2227.24 --> 2233.52
lot of orgon energy in the air or

2229.52 --> 2233.52
something because the trails ain't

2238.119 --> 2246.2000000000003
staying could you imagine like a

2242.599 --> 2249.599
loua type of giant pair remember that

2246.2 --> 2252.68
ugly thing in L it's not that ugly it's

2249.599 --> 2255.44
but it is like creepy a big that big

2252.68 --> 2258.72
glass pyramid thing right what if there

2255.44 --> 2261.96
was like an orone

2258.72 --> 2264.4399999999996
generator which typically is like a

2261.96 --> 2266.7200000000003
pyramid shape just as big as that and

2264.44 --> 2268.599
you just have an orgon generator like in

2266.72 --> 2270.9199999999996
the middle of the city in in a park or

2268.599 --> 2273.1600000000003
something and it's like yeah you could

2270.92 --> 2277.48
try to drop camp Trails over this place

2273.16 --> 2279.5989999999997
all you like like they refuse to stay

2277.48 --> 2282.2400000000002
they're just going to disintegrate every

2279.599 --> 2285.319
the second they

2282.24 --> 2289.0
hit don't ask me how that's even

2285.319 --> 2293.48
possible I just heard that that

2289.0 --> 2293.48
works from Freeman in

2297.44 --> 2304.7200000000003
2008 and that that notion has been

2300.4 --> 2308.52
echoed I've met people that said like no

2304.72 --> 2311.52
I actually do that it really does work

2308.52 --> 2315.2
work I think they actually even like

2311.52 --> 2318.04
demonstrated it I just couldn't I almost

2315.2 --> 2320.24
couldn't believe that it was real as it

2318.04 --> 2320.24
was

2323.119 --> 2329.119
happening

2326.119 --> 2329.119
anyway

2330.839 --> 2333.839
neoplatonist

2335.52 --> 2341.48
what

2338.28 --> 2345.6400000000003
the neop what is what is neop

2341.48 --> 2345.64
platonist or is it a neop

2345.68 --> 2350.2799999999997
platonist

2347.64 --> 2354.0789999999997
what I don't get it anyway I'm going to

2350.28 --> 2354.079
turn on my coffee and I'll be right

2365.44 --> 2368.44
back

2421.76 --> 2428.0400000000004
I didn't have any heating I completely

2425.359 --> 2432.44
forgot

2428.04 --> 2435.92
think I'm going to turn on the it this

2432.44 --> 2439.2400000000002
Sun's no longer hitting the W not that

2435.92 --> 2439.2400000000002
Pleasant the temperature

2454.2 --> 2458.319
here that's more like it

2465.44 --> 2469.319
I have no idea what you two are talking

2474.2 --> 2478.8799999999997
about all right anyway I hope you found

2479.079 --> 2485.119
the the first part of the show very

2481.64 --> 2485.1189999999997
informative I thought it

2485.24 --> 2488.24
was

2515.24 --> 2518.24
for

2526.64 --> 2531.7999999999997
so duper are you going to watch the link

2529.68 --> 2535.68
I

2531.8 --> 2535.6800000000003
posted it's going to blow your

2545.16 --> 2550.7599999999998
mind everything is from one oh

2557.04 --> 2561.52
okay interesting I

2575.16 --> 2578.16
guess

2605.079 --> 2608.079
that's

2624.28 --> 2626.52
all

2631.119 --> 2635.559
right so yeah I got all the room I mean

2633.68 --> 2637.96
I I basically set everything that I

2635.559 --> 2641.3590000000004
wanted to say

2637.96 --> 2643.0
about this subject the video like if I

2641.359 --> 2647.24
really want to get deeper into it I

2643.0 --> 2649.839
first off have to get better sleep not

2647.24 --> 2652.5589999999997
go to bed after like 5 o' or whatever

2649.839 --> 2652.5589999999997
crazy time it

2653.079 --> 2660.0
was and watch it

2656.119 --> 2660.0
again a little better

2664.88 --> 2669.96
rested that L yeah it's crazy

2694.96 --> 2697.96
stupid

2704.04 --> 2710.04
by the way Richard G did you catch that

2705.96 --> 2712.7200000000003
part I explained a bit why I

2710.04 --> 2715.5589999999997
thought the guy brought up gravity in

2712.72 --> 2718.1189999999997
the video did you hear that part where I

2715.559 --> 2718.119
explained

2720.04 --> 2723.24
that hey

2724.88 --> 2727.88
Shi

2731.16 --> 2735.839
90% you have no idea what I'm talking

2733.44 --> 2735.839
about

2739.319 --> 2744.72
what that that's not good

2747.28 --> 2755.44
duper that's not good at

2751.079 --> 2758.44
all I mean at this point I i' be

2755.44 --> 2759.68
expecting you to understand at least 50%

2758.44 --> 2765.64
of what I'm

2759.68 --> 2765.64
saying not 10% that is not

2765.68 --> 2770.68
good you need to learn to attune my

2784.8 --> 2787.8
man

2790.96 --> 2798.2400000000002
you did hear it what do you

2793.96 --> 2800.4
think it's it really felt like there was

2798.24 --> 2804.0789999999997
no actual significance in him bringing

2800.4 --> 2806.28
up gravity it's just seemed like an ad

2804.079 --> 2808.92
trick like he was hooking people that

2806.28 --> 2812.079
were like really frustrated about still

2808.92 --> 2814.92
not knowing what gravity is right he

2812.079 --> 2817.6400000000003
probably knows about that and he's like

2814.92 --> 2820.64
oh yeah we might have our biological

2817.64 --> 2823.2
research might be revealing

2820.64 --> 2826.96
gravity it felt like an

2823.2 --> 2826.96
atric kind of smart

2827.96 --> 2834.559
too but I mean he didn't really get into

2831.16 --> 2834.5589999999997
physics like that at

2835.48 --> 2839.2400000000002
all he just mentioned

2839.559 --> 2844.7200000000003
it it's like oh outer space is filled

2842.359 --> 2847.72
with this like

2844.72 --> 2847.72
what

2849.28 --> 2857.52
it sort of did right yeah so he didn't

2853.48 --> 2857.52
mention it because he didn't know about

2858.359 --> 2863.5989999999997
it but he didn't like make real weird

2862.0 --> 2866.92
claims that I didn't like talk about

2863.599 --> 2869.599
space-time bending or about Newtonian

2866.92 --> 2871.96
forces or forces at all you didn't talk

2869.599 --> 2873.2400000000002
about forces or SpaceTime bending so

2871.96 --> 2876.359
it's

2873.24 --> 2878.2
like you just kind of hit hinted at a

2876.359 --> 2880.72
bit of gravity it's like like you mind

2878.2 --> 2884.1189999999997
find a bit of gravity

2880.72 --> 2888.2799999999997
here it's worth researching you might

2884.119 --> 2891.8
learn what gravity is it seemed actually

2888.28 --> 2891.8
like really smart like

2893.0 --> 2898.76
that brushed over real quick indeed yeah

2895.96 --> 2901.68
I didn't stick to that thank God that

2898.76 --> 2901.6800000000003
would have been a real

2903.319 --> 2909.24
bummer right anyway I'm going to get my

2906.319 --> 2909.24
coffee I'll be right

2934.599 --> 2937.599
back

2964.52 --> 2967.52
for

2994.52 --> 2997.52
okay

3004.16 --> 3007.359
okay let's see how well that

3008.48 --> 3014.28
works I just had a really weird

3011.119 --> 3016.559
experience that was very interesting

3014.28 --> 3019.44
it's not that weird it's just that I'm

3016.559 --> 3022.4
surprised think it might have

3019.44 --> 3025.119
worked I basically applied the technique

3022.4 --> 3027.4
as I was walking up the stairs and I did

3025.119 --> 3029.96
it extremely

3027.4 --> 3032.599
quick like normally that's a process

3029.96 --> 3036.319
that takes like at least 2

3032.599 --> 3040.28
minutes and I like rushed through it at

3036.319 --> 3045.52
like four times five times normal

3040.28 --> 3049.48
speed and it worked it it it's almost

3045.52 --> 3052.28
like it got pulled out of my mouth it

3049.48 --> 3056.88
was so fast and it worked it got it got

3052.28 --> 3058.6800000000003
pull like it felt like it was like a a

3056.88 --> 3060.599
what do you call it like water suction

3058.68 --> 3062.7599999999998
or something like there's a pole behind

3060.599 --> 3063.799
it it could just once it got going at

3062.76 --> 3066.3190000000004
that speed it

3063.799 --> 3069.16
just it just got pulled out of there

3066.319 --> 3072.799
fully automatic it's like

3069.16 --> 3072.799
whoa but I think it

3072.88 --> 3077.28
worked

3074.4 --> 3080.559
huh that's the fastest application of

3077.28 --> 3080.559
the technique I've done

3084.359 --> 3087.359
today

3090.68 --> 3096.48
cutting back on caffeine would be a

3092.64 --> 3099.1189999999997
start n what be a good start is like

3096.48 --> 3101.2400000000002
just go to damn bed and stop wanting

3099.119 --> 3104.88
more and more because that's really

3101.24 --> 3109.9599999999996
what's keeping me up is that I just get

3104.88 --> 3112.44
this like this teenager like enthusiasm

3109.96 --> 3114.799
and I I've always had well not always I

3112.44 --> 3118.16
have phases of this where I'm just like

3114.799 --> 3120.72
the later it becomes my body slows down

3118.16 --> 3123.319
but my mind speeds up and then it's like

3120.72 --> 3126.5589999999997
oh suddenly I

3123.319 --> 3130.72
like certain parts of my mind work

3126.559 --> 3133.48
really quickly because

3130.72 --> 3135.5989999999997
they're like at the end of the cycle and

3133.48 --> 3138.92
it all works efficiently now other parts

3135.599 --> 3141.48
of me are tired I'm less expressive but

3138.92 --> 3144.839
my mind in ways is much quicker I just

3141.48 --> 3148.119
can't express myself as well when it's

3144.839 --> 3152.7599999999998
really late but my mind works incredibly

3148.119 --> 3154.96
quick like I don't get fatigued at night

3152.76 --> 3154.96
like

3155.079 --> 3161.04
that my mind doesn't get fatigued if my

3157.96 --> 3162.04
mind gets fatigued I literally go to bed

3161.04 --> 3165.319
very

3162.04 --> 3167.88
quickly but I mean that's doesn't really

3165.319 --> 3167.88
happen that

3169.119 --> 3174.559
much do brain teasers are yeah that's a

3172.52 --> 3175.799
good tip yeah definitely not brain

3174.559 --> 3178.3190000000004
teasers

3175.799 --> 3181.24
when you plan to go to bed that's been a

3178.319 --> 3183.079
bit of a problem but it's the problem is

3181.24 --> 3185.9199999999996
is that I'm just like I want more more

3183.079 --> 3188.7200000000003
more when it's late that's the

3185.92 --> 3193.119
problem like when I could just say like

3188.72 --> 3195.2799999999997
uh what if you just don't want more and

3193.119 --> 3199.48
you just get up earlier have better

3195.28 --> 3201.76
focus more clarity and then want all

3199.48 --> 3201.76
that

3202.24 --> 3208.04
more but I'm having a bit of trouble

3204.559 --> 3208.0400000000004
like convincing myself of

3208.44 --> 3212.2000000000003
that it's it's going to be a bit of a

3210.92 --> 3214.7200000000003
long-term

3212.2 --> 3216.7599999999998
project but what I do know is that I'm

3214.72 --> 3220.1189999999997
definitely not going to let it keep

3216.76 --> 3223.8390000000004
getting worse and worse like I

3220.119 --> 3226.88
did like 15 years ago

3223.839 --> 3230.5589999999997
typically and I would have these crazy

3226.88 --> 3232.4
months where I would have 27 hour days

3230.559 --> 3237.1600000000003
would like continually keep shifting

3232.4 --> 3237.1600000000003
that was crazy stuff and not very

3238.0 --> 3242.88
healthy like it did make me sick but it

3240.44 --> 3242.88
made me

3246.96 --> 3256.359
weird I did actually have like one of my

3250.559 --> 3256.3590000000004
biggest Inspirations during my 27 hour

3257.52 --> 3262.0
cycle and that's why I then held on to

3259.88 --> 3264.6800000000003
it cuz it was just like wow inspiration

3262.0 --> 3269.799
inspiration okay if my inspiration Cycle

3264.68 --> 3269.799
Works a 27 hour cycle then so be

3270.96 --> 3276.4
it time extension yeah no it just kept

3274.0 --> 3280.48
shifting for me I just lived a 27 hour

3276.4 --> 3283.48
day so like at the start of the week I

3280.48 --> 3284.839
would wake up at 8 in the morning and at

3283.48 --> 3287.839
the end of

3284.839 --> 3287.839
the

3287.92 --> 3296.2000000000003
week I would get up like at 10: at in

3293.76 --> 3300.0
the evening or something like like

3296.2 --> 3304.4399999999996
completely Relentless like

3300.0 --> 3304.44
that like totally weird

3308.92 --> 3313.839
Rhythm Tommy Ryan

3315.88 --> 3322.0
Johnson right but I don't do that stuff

3319.24 --> 3324.4799999999996
anymore I mean if I'd have like a

3322.0 --> 3327.44
massive project that I can like really

3324.48 --> 3330.079
work on like what I did back then during

3327.44 --> 3333.48
that also which was during the time when

3330.079 --> 3336.6400000000003
I was really making work of my DND D

3333.48 --> 3338.52
book when I really open up the whole

3336.64 --> 3340.68
thing like okay I'm going to make more

3338.52 --> 3342.079
than just spells now I'm going to make

3340.68 --> 3343.72
everything I'm going to remake the

3342.079 --> 3346.4
skills I'm going to remake the whole

3343.72 --> 3350.3999999999996
feed system I'm going to

3346.4 --> 3352.839
remake everything base glasses Prestige

3350.4 --> 3357.0
class every like that's when that that's

3352.839 --> 3357.0
part of that 27 hour cycle

3357.64 --> 3361.2
it was I when I really got

3367.359 --> 3370.92
going but

3375.079 --> 3378.6800000000003
yeah finish this

3383.92 --> 3386.92
up

3413.88 --> 3416.88
h

3443.96 --> 3451.96
man seven p.m. to bed that is so

3447.76 --> 3455.28
early but I guess that you guys

3451.96 --> 3458.44
are going to be with me because I am

3455.28 --> 3458.44
very early for the

3461.44 --> 3467.76
US trust me I don't go to bed at

3464.68 --> 3470.7599999999998
7 I don't think I've ever in my life

3467.76 --> 3473.7990000000004
gone to bed at 7 except maybe somewhere

3470.76 --> 3476.3590000000004
in that 27 hour

3473.799 --> 3480.24
cycle

3476.359 --> 3483.0789999999997
but even as a kid I like would go to

3480.24 --> 3486.0789999999997
bed

3483.079 --> 3488.2400000000002
9 the

3486.079 --> 3490.0
earliest like if it was eight or

3488.24 --> 3493.4799999999996
something I would just stay up like

3490.0 --> 3493.48
bouncing in my bed it was very

3503.72 --> 3506.72
annoying

3513.28 --> 3517.599
you watch me in bed okay

3525.799 --> 3532.88
R yesterday was a whole bunch of cranky

3529.48 --> 3535.76
trolls like a whole lot of them today

3532.88 --> 3538.1600000000003
doesn't really seem like that except for

3535.76 --> 3538.1600000000003
you

3541.28 --> 3545.0
guys bigger

3543.48 --> 3549.119
TV

3545.0 --> 3549.119
what you watch me on the

3551.4 --> 3554.4
television

3559.039 --> 3563.6400000000003
really

3561.319 --> 3565.599
bedroom that's just

3563.64 --> 3567.68
weird

3565.599 --> 3571.039
but okay I guess if if you like to do

3567.68 --> 3571.0389999999998
that but man that is just

3577.24 --> 3583.72
weird 4K damn okay I hope

3583.92 --> 3587.88
uh I don't look that

3588.039 --> 3593.96
terrible at 4K I have no

3591.2 --> 3597.5589999999997
idea I don't know even like what YouTube

3593.96 --> 3597.559
really provides FES for in that

3605.16 --> 3611.68
sense get up scills oh

3609.0 --> 3614.92
okay well at least you'll be able to

3611.68 --> 3617.16
like read the chat on screen that way

3614.92 --> 3617.16
for

3620.48 --> 3625.72
sure like if I want to read the chat on

3623.48 --> 3629.559
the screen I have to like maximized the

3625.72 --> 3629.5589999999997
screen just to be able to see

3631.079 --> 3637.6800000000003
that I can get the

3634.68 --> 3637.68
resolution

3638.64 --> 3643.1189999999997
yeah and my resolution is like 720 so

3642.119 --> 3645.6800000000003
it's

3643.119 --> 3650.559
not really all that

3645.68 --> 3650.5589999999997
great but yeah big screen will certainly

3653.52 --> 3656.52
help

3683.44 --> 3686.44
for

3712.359 --> 3716.44
that the main topic today

3717.359 --> 3722.16
what I don't really have a main top I

3720.039 --> 3725.0
was basically talking

3722.16 --> 3726.0389999999998
about the video that Richard G linked me

3725.0 --> 3729.48
up

3726.039 --> 3729.48
with the new

3730.319 --> 3737.52
biology that's the main topic but I mean

3734.039 --> 3737.5200000000004
like yeah it's going to run

3737.88 --> 3746.359
out like I I definitely need to watch

3740.799 --> 3746.359
that again before I get back to it

3753.64 --> 3759.279
and other than that yeah whatever I mean

3756.92 --> 3761.4
there's always an opportunity to dig

3759.279 --> 3762.64
back up the subject that I have been

3761.4 --> 3765.559
talking

3762.64 --> 3768.16
about right because I don't exactly

3765.559 --> 3769.92
expect anybody here to like immediately

3768.16 --> 3772.799
just get everything that I'm talking

3769.92 --> 3776.039
about especially dupons apparently only

3772.799 --> 3778.88
follows 10% of what I'm talking

3776.039 --> 3781.4
about if that's the case then definitely

3778.88 --> 3781.4
keep

3795.76 --> 3800.6800000000003
asking SE the navigation

3801.4 --> 3807.7200000000003
yeah no not the spike protein

3805.079 --> 3807.7200000000003
here we go

3813.119 --> 3821.1600000000003
again it's a completely different model

3817.48 --> 3824.079
for biology as a whole one that actually

3821.16 --> 3824.0789999999997
makes any damn

3829.559 --> 3836.279
sense yeah you couldn't check it out

3831.92 --> 3836.279
because you left the early bird chat

3839.16 --> 3844.8799999999997
where I post these

3842.279 --> 3848.64
videos so you can actually watch the

3844.88 --> 3848.6400000000003
stuff that I'm going to be

3863.2 --> 3866.2
reviewing

3874.4 --> 3879.88
your work you

3877.119 --> 3883.599
know okay don't know what that has to do

3879.88 --> 3883.599
with anything but yeah

3893.16 --> 3896.359
sure

3894.68 --> 3900.5989999999997
cheat and Juice

3896.359 --> 3903.279
ground yeah Brianna I mean nobody really

3900.599 --> 3905.799
in general uses a sexton anymore it's

3903.279 --> 3905.799
kind of

3907.319 --> 3912.72
outdated but the points that I make with

3909.799 --> 3915.319
the sexton especially like oh bubble

3912.72 --> 3917.8799999999997
sexon is that that's all super cute

3915.319 --> 3920.5589999999997
except that's not what they were doing

3917.88 --> 3924.88
back then so my

3920.559 --> 3928.119
beef about the sexon is is

3924.88 --> 3930.599
a lot of bards now realizing about

3928.119 --> 3935.279
Celestial navigation are

3930.599 --> 3938.2000000000003
falsifying or not falsifying it or

3935.279 --> 3940.44
creating a false history about how sexon

3938.2 --> 3942.359
were used in the past claiming that they

3940.44 --> 3945.68
were using bubble sexon during the

3942.359 --> 3951.16
exploration age which was absolutely not

3945.68 --> 3951.16
true they were absolutely not using

3953.079 --> 3956.079
that

3959.72 --> 3964.48
and that's why that discussion keeps

3961.599 --> 3965.7200000000003
popping back up people claim like oh use

3964.48 --> 3968.079
the bubble and then you don't have to

3965.72 --> 3970.1189999999997
use the yeah but that doesn't work on a

3968.079 --> 3972.319
rocking

3970.119 --> 3975.92
boat and they didn't have that

3972.319 --> 3978.16
technology like a

3975.92 --> 3980.0
bubble the only way they would have done

3978.16 --> 3981.96
that then is like

3980.0 --> 3984.52
by like

3981.96 --> 3988.44
somehow using very

3984.52 --> 3991.279
relatively pre-industrial era Tech to

3988.44 --> 3994.359
like create a glass

3991.279 --> 3997.37
ampule with a liquid in it the oil and

3994.359 --> 3998.68
an air bubble like

3997.37 --> 4001.64
[Music]

3998.68 --> 4003.2
dude it would have been very might have

4001.64 --> 4006.1189999999997
been out there but it would have been

4003.2 --> 4009.24
very rare and it would probably break at

4006.119 --> 4012.6400000000003
a whim and so it was definitely not

4009.24 --> 4017.1189999999997
standardized well every human being

4012.64 --> 4019.359
pretty much is built with an inner ear

4017.119 --> 4022.839
that enables them to keep balance on a

4019.359 --> 4026.119
rocking boat while focusing on the

4022.839 --> 4028.64
horizon which stays absolutely

4026.119 --> 4031.96
still despite the boat

4028.64 --> 4033.839
rocking yeah so that's how they would

4031.96 --> 4038.799
have done

4033.839 --> 4041.52
it not using a freaking bubble on on the

4038.799 --> 4046.599
open ocean like no they just didn't do

4041.52 --> 4046.599
that that wasn't there and that like my

4046.72 --> 4049.72
overall

4049.88 --> 4055.48
point to counter this notion like oh

4053.079 --> 4057.96
yeah we knew it was a ball and we

4055.48 --> 4061.319
weren't using the Horizon because it's

4057.96 --> 4065.0
not ah you shouldn't be seeing things

4061.319 --> 4068.16
and H whatever it's like it's refracted

4065.0 --> 4068.16
so you can't use the

4068.88 --> 4074.2400000000002
Horizon we're just going to take a

4071.319 --> 4076.72
vertical and then use the horizontal in

4074.24 --> 4079.68
relation to that and use that as a

4076.72 --> 4082.1189999999997
baseline except that doesn't work on a

4079.68 --> 4082.1189999999997
rocking

4082.24 --> 4088.4399999999996
boat and the boat's going to be rocking

4085.64 --> 4091.24
most of the time on the

4088.44 --> 4093.48
ocean so you're never have an

4091.24 --> 4097.96
opportunity to actually then use your

4093.48 --> 4097.96
bubble cuz you're always on a rocking

4099.64 --> 4105.319
boat bubbles with Sextant are only

4104.159 --> 4108.639999999999
really

4105.319 --> 4110.319
useful for land

4108.64 --> 4113.88
surveying

4110.319 --> 4118.2390000000005
okay because the land ain't

4113.88 --> 4118.2390000000005
moving stationary it's not

4130.069 --> 4135.799
[Applause]

4132.799 --> 4135.799
rocking

4142.48 --> 4146.0
floid believes in the

4146.88 --> 4152.159000000001
Mandela

4149.159 --> 4152.159
okay

4160.4 --> 4166.159
yeah and I mean in a way I don't blame

4163.08 --> 4169.88
him I mean there's something weird there

4166.159 --> 4172.879999999999
it's just definitely not

4169.88 --> 4172.88
reality

4173.4 --> 4179.12
changing that's definitely not what a

4176.719 --> 4181.12
Mandela effect is it is definitely a

4179.12 --> 4183.719
cognitive thing and that cognitive thing

4181.12 --> 4186.3189999999995
might be really mysterious in a

4183.719 --> 4188.08
way but in all the examples that I know

4186.319 --> 4190.080000000001
of with the mandal effect it doesn't

4188.08 --> 4193.159
seem that

4190.08 --> 4194.6
complicated it just seems like it's the

4193.159 --> 4198.32
aesthetic

4194.6 --> 4202.360000000001
mind that as you freshly for the first

4198.32 --> 4205.5199999999995
time perceive something you organize it

4202.36 --> 4206.92
like your your fresh Consciousness

4205.52 --> 4210.84
organizes

4206.92 --> 4212.2390000000005
it and then it uses certain archetypes

4210.84 --> 4214.6
and

4212.239 --> 4218.08
structures like that you are familiar

4214.6 --> 4220.360000000001
with that feel Pleasant that make it

4218.08 --> 4222.64
memorable and sometimes something

4220.36 --> 4224.639999999999
happens in like a movie or

4222.64 --> 4228.8
whatever that's

4224.64 --> 4231.400000000001
off like uh that's like not the way you

4228.8 --> 4231.400000000001
would have done

4231.96 --> 4238.8
it right

4235.44 --> 4242.239
like in the James Bond with

4238.8 --> 4244.52
the the Jaws character and the girl

4242.239 --> 4247.04
everybody's like why she must have

4244.52 --> 4249.400000000001
bracers because that moment makes

4247.04 --> 4252.5199999999995
absolutely no sent if she doesn't have

4249.4 --> 4254.879999999999
bracers and they didn't do it it's

4252.52 --> 4256.4800000000005
actually quite s itic when you think

4254.88 --> 4261.96
about

4256.48 --> 4264.239
it like the movie maker build up that

4261.96 --> 4267.84
anticipation these two characters that

4264.239 --> 4267.839999999999
you're like

4268.32 --> 4273.92
wow that's funny and

4271.36 --> 4277.28
interesting kind of quirky to get like

4273.92 --> 4280.0
they built up almost like a date that

4277.28 --> 4282.0
was about to happen and everybody

4280.0 --> 4285.159
expected like wow if they just have that

4282.0 --> 4287.4
same thing it's like perfect and then

4285.159 --> 4289.679
she didn't have the bracers but

4287.4 --> 4292.679
everybody in their mind is like she has

4289.679 --> 4295.4400000000005
bracers she has so it's

4292.679 --> 4297.639
like what's wrong why doesn't she have

4295.44 --> 4300.44
bracers and now we're thinking like oh

4297.639 --> 4303.0
she always had bracers instead of

4300.44 --> 4305.239
realizing like the first time everybody

4303.0 --> 4308.84
saw that everybody

4305.239 --> 4312.199
was why doesn't she have bracers yeah

4308.84 --> 4314.04
that's the first response of everybody

4312.199 --> 4317.599999999999
that actually cared and was emotionally

4314.04 --> 4320.44
invest like why doesn't she have

4317.6 --> 4322.320000000001
bracers but when you then like forget

4320.44 --> 4323.919999999999
about it like oh well who cares it's a

4322.32 --> 4326.48
stupid movie and then later you watch it

4323.92 --> 4330.679
again it's like wait didn't she have

4326.48 --> 4333.08
bracers it changed it changed no the

4330.679 --> 4335.1990000000005
very [ __ ] first time everybody saw

4333.08 --> 4336.679
that everybody thought why doesn't she

4335.199 --> 4341.28
have

4336.679 --> 4345.12
bracers cuz it's a stupid aesthetic

4341.28 --> 4347.8
trick everybody expects that be that's

4345.12 --> 4349.96
the right way to do it and that's how

4347.8 --> 4352.88
you then remember

4349.96 --> 4355.679
it and then you think in your memory

4352.88 --> 4358.08
like no it was the right way now it's

4355.679 --> 4362.88
different no it was never the right way

4358.08 --> 4362.88
it was always there to [ __ ] around with

4363.52 --> 4368.96
you yeah ends with all of

4370.04 --> 4376.12
it Luke I am your father no everybody

4374.04 --> 4378.4
expected that to say because that would

4376.12 --> 4380.48
have been the most succinct most

4378.4 --> 4382.638999999999
powerful part of the message if you just

4380.48 --> 4387.44
say Luke

4382.639 --> 4390.76
you I am your father it's boom boom boom

4387.44 --> 4394.4
it's the perfect power move of

4390.76 --> 4396.4400000000005
directness he didn't say it like that

4394.4 --> 4398.159
but everybody remembers it like that

4396.44 --> 4399.839999999999
because that would have been the best

4398.159 --> 4402.96
thing to say it would have been the most

4399.84 --> 4404.04
powerful he didn't say that he said no I

4402.96 --> 4406.88
am your

4404.04 --> 4410.56
it was interrupted his moment his moment

4406.88 --> 4413.92
of power doing the Luke I am your father

4410.56 --> 4416.56
was basically cut short by another

4413.92 --> 4419.719
Dynamic by another back and forth so it

4416.56 --> 4422.400000000001
didn't come to that it was no I am your

4419.719 --> 4426.679
father which is still harsh and

4422.4 --> 4430.5599999999995
impactful but it's not the perfect way

4426.679 --> 4433.4800000000005
and it when I first saw that movie in 97

4430.56 --> 4437.280000000001
on a videotape for the very first time

4433.48 --> 4439.5199999999995
time I was really impressed Star Wars 5

4437.28 --> 4442.44
Empire Strikes oh my God was I impressed

4439.52 --> 4444.2390000000005
from that but when I then mentioned

4442.44 --> 4446.32
about talked to my brother about who was

4444.239 --> 4448.36
a big Star Wars

4446.32 --> 4452.36
fan back

4448.36 --> 4454.12
then I said oh and when he said Luke I

4452.36 --> 4455.599999999999
am your father my brother was

4454.12 --> 4459.44
immediately

4455.6 --> 4462.4800000000005
no like he already knew about the

4459.44 --> 4465.48
freaking Mandela effect with that and he

4462.48 --> 4469.5199999999995
said immediately no that's not what he

4465.48 --> 4472.919999999999
said I was like what

4469.52 --> 4477.719
didn't I had seen that movie

4472.92 --> 4479.76
like 3 hours before that moment where I

4477.719 --> 4483.76
said oh when he said Luke I am your

4479.76 --> 4487.96
father I got it wrong after 3 hours yeah

4483.76 --> 4490.4400000000005
I remember that very clearly that that

4487.96 --> 4492.08
happened I saw the movie I was super

4490.44 --> 4493.759999999999
impressed talk to my brother about it I

4492.08 --> 4496.639
knew it was a Star Wars F man mentioned

4493.76 --> 4498.8
Luke I am your father he got irritated

4496.639 --> 4500.639
immediately he says no that's not what

4498.8 --> 4505.04
he said

4500.639 --> 4510.2390000000005
what yeah that's not all the Mela effect

4505.04 --> 4512.199
they changed it no I just got it wrong

4510.239 --> 4514.5199999999995
immediately

4512.199 --> 4518.5599999999995
because it's like this missed

4514.52 --> 4520.639
opportunity an iconic power word moment

4518.56 --> 4525.1990000000005
that everybody expects that's the

4520.639 --> 4525.1990000000005
perfect thing to say to get to somebody

4525.76 --> 4534.0
a three-step Luke you say the

4528.679 --> 4536.4800000000005
name I switch me your father like boom

4534.0 --> 4539.8
boom boom it's like the most direct most

4536.48 --> 4541.638999999999
powerful loaded message to symbolize

4539.8 --> 4544.4800000000005
that entire

4541.639 --> 4547.8
situation the power move but he didn't

4544.48 --> 4552.36
say it like that but everybody

4547.8 --> 4555.4800000000005
anticipated that to be said because just

4552.36 --> 4559.48
saying it like that symbolically

4555.48 --> 4559.48
personifies that entire

4560.0 --> 4567.56
scenario but it's the aesthetic memory

4563.44 --> 4569.36
that like puts the ideal version over

4567.56 --> 4573.2390000000005
the real

4569.36 --> 4573.239
version that's the mandala

4577.08 --> 4585.12
effect your memory remembers things

4580.8 --> 4585.12
better than they really are

4587.08 --> 4591.32
especially when there is like an

4588.52 --> 4594.159000000001
inconsistency that ruins the

4591.32 --> 4596.5199999999995
whole you you could say that people even

4594.159 --> 4598.48
have Mandela effect towards other

4596.52 --> 4600.679
individuals where they think they're

4598.48 --> 4602.5599999999995
like in love with a person and

4600.679 --> 4603.88
everything about that person to them is

4602.56 --> 4606.92
just

4603.88 --> 4608.639
amazing except for that very rare time

4606.92 --> 4612.4400000000005
when there's this other side of them

4608.639 --> 4614.2390000000005
that's completely off and like very off

4612.44 --> 4615.919999999999
putting in your hate that and they're

4614.239 --> 4617.919999999999
like you don't even it doesn't even feel

4615.92 --> 4619.88
like the same person or they might have

4617.92 --> 4622.32
that and you'll be like

4619.88 --> 4624.6
ah and then they'll like flip and

4622.32 --> 4627.04
they're like whoa what happened like

4624.6 --> 4629.56
they weren't even conscious about it

4627.04 --> 4632.88
they go back and then you forget that

4629.56 --> 4636.88
happen and then in your memory that

4632.88 --> 4639.639
doesn't exist because it's disruptive

4636.88 --> 4643.08
with the rest of the whole alchemical

4639.639 --> 4645.159000000001
thing that you personally bonding with

4643.08 --> 4648.04
so you don't remember the aesthetic

4645.159 --> 4651.4
memory blots out the

4648.04 --> 4655.96
bad because it's in the

4651.4 --> 4657.159
way and then in your ready to use memory

4655.96 --> 4659.84
it's

4657.159 --> 4664.08
simply replaced with the aesthetic

4659.84 --> 4667.679
memory instead of the real real

4664.08 --> 4670.12
thing that's the Mandela effect it's

4667.679 --> 4672.0
purely psychological I'm absolutely

4670.12 --> 4675.0
certain about

4672.0 --> 4675.0
this

4675.76 --> 4680.92
and I have personal references for

4690.08 --> 4695.48
it rented a film and then when you

4693.239 --> 4698.959999999999
finish you put the TV on and it was

4695.48 --> 4701.44
there that's that's weird I'm getting

4698.96 --> 4704.44
that kind of effect too but that's like

4701.44 --> 4709.759999999999
algorithmic r Johnson there's algorithms

4704.44 --> 4709.759999999999
that literally like spy on what you're

4711.639 --> 4717.8
doing they check out what you do they

4714.8 --> 4717.8
check out what you're

4718.719 --> 4724.2390000000005
watching and if there's like

4721.8 --> 4728.320000000001
recognizable things like

4724.239 --> 4730.48
movies then they can literally like just

4728.32 --> 4735.12
say like oh you're a fan of this oh I

4730.48 --> 4736.759999999999
know about that oh I'm so relatable I'm

4735.12 --> 4739.719
shoving in your face what you just

4736.76 --> 4741.52
watched I'm so relatable yeah that's an

4739.719 --> 4744.44
algorithmic tactic so it's not

4741.52 --> 4748.0
surprising at all that sort of things

4744.44 --> 4750.04
happens a lot these days with

4748.0 --> 4753.08
everybody because the algorithm is

4750.04 --> 4755.5199999999995
always just trying to be so sympathetic

4753.08 --> 4755.5199999999995
so

4758.4 --> 4764.839999999999
relatable CU it's just

4761.84 --> 4764.84
desperation

4787.51 --> 4791.01
[Applause]

4791.84 --> 4796.28
for

4793.11 --> 4796.28
[Applause]

4833.43 --> 4841.25
[Applause]

4851.719 --> 4854.719
for

4856.76 --> 4859.96
yay I can make it

4868.84 --> 4872.360000000001
fit I got a

4872.44 --> 4880.678999999999
title the biology we learned in school

4875.239 --> 4880.678999999999
was wrong and the psychological Mandela

4881.639 --> 4884.639
effect

4884.79 --> 4887.829
[Music]

4896.6 --> 4901.679
yeah I mean you can never explain the

4899.199 --> 4904.96
Mandela effect psychology

4901.679 --> 4907.88
enough cuz people like it it's like a

4904.96 --> 4910.32
magic trick to people except the magic

4907.88 --> 4912.28
trick is literally in your own mind this

4910.32 --> 4913.159
is not a magic trick that some magician

4912.28 --> 4915.04
is like

4913.159 --> 4918.199
oh switchy switchy oh look at this

4915.04 --> 4920.199
little smart trick no now this is

4918.199 --> 4922.48
literally done by your own brain it's a

4920.199 --> 4926.0
magic trick that's literally done by

4922.48 --> 4929.0
your own brain nobody else does that the

4926.0 --> 4931.8
brain does that now people might

4929.0 --> 4936.32
anticipate that your brain does that to

4931.8 --> 4938.4400000000005
you without you knowing by creating a

4936.32 --> 4940.0
story building

4938.44 --> 4943.32
certain

4940.0 --> 4947.36
tension that creates anticipation

4943.32 --> 4950.28
and then not paying off with the proper

4947.36 --> 4954.639
climax to that anticipation build

4950.28 --> 4958.36
up that will trigger Mandela effect yeah

4954.639 --> 4962.679
if you ruin climax

4958.36 --> 4966.04
Moment Like important resolving of

4962.679 --> 4969.4400000000005
issues or the the shattering of a

4966.04 --> 4972.0
paradigm of the whole situation right

4969.44 --> 4974.0
when those things are done aesthetically

4972.0 --> 4976.92
incorrect irly there's something

4974.0 --> 4979.719
unpleasing about those moments it will

4976.92 --> 4983.159
like really create a a restlessness in

4979.719 --> 4984.719
people that will a activate their

4983.159 --> 4989.638999999999
aesthetic

4984.719 --> 4992.04
mind that will byass the entire dis

4989.639 --> 4994.56
junting conflict spiritually that's

4992.04 --> 4997.08
happening in that moment in favor of a

4994.56 --> 5000.84
more aesthetic version that's less

4997.08 --> 5006.6
disruptive to to you so the disruption

5000.84 --> 5008.639
is like negated ignored by replacing the

5006.6 --> 5011.96
better aesthetic version of it in the

5008.639 --> 5014.12
memory it's a magic trick that the Mind

5011.96 --> 5018.4
does to us

5014.12 --> 5021.28
all and some movie making Wizards and

5018.4 --> 5025.08
all that they abuse that and even

5021.28 --> 5029.599999999999
corporations when they choose

5025.08 --> 5033.5199999999995
names for their for their franchises

5029.6 --> 5036.679
Etc they like make it slightly weird

5033.52 --> 5040.6
it's like Interview with the Vampire

5036.679 --> 5042.8
yeah that sucks the way that's the way

5040.6 --> 5045.6
interview with the vamp what do you mean

5042.8 --> 5049.84
the vampire it's [ __ ] stupid it

5045.6 --> 5053.4800000000005
should be a why because that's

5049.84 --> 5055.719
fluid and what do you mean the vampire

5053.48 --> 5057.48
that's already like an idiotic premise

5055.719 --> 5060.6
like there's the what do you mean the

5057.48 --> 5065.48
vamp everything about Interview with the

5060.6 --> 5067.96
Vampire is stupid it sucks guess what it

5065.48 --> 5072.199
sucks on

5067.96 --> 5074.28
purpose the movie maker wanted to [ __ ]

5072.199 --> 5077.599999999999
with his

5074.28 --> 5079.639
audience cuz he knew probably from

5077.6 --> 5081.56
testing out the title that everybody

5079.639 --> 5083.88
thought Interview with the Vampire he's

5081.56 --> 5086.04
like H that's

5083.88 --> 5088.679
funny I'm going to call it Interview

5086.04 --> 5093.04
with the Vampire and everybody will just

5088.679 --> 5096.1990000000005
think it's a vampire a yeah because

5093.04 --> 5099.48
they're satanic sadists people that do

5096.199 --> 5101.4
that sort of stuff yeah the more satanic

5099.48 --> 5107.04
and

5101.4 --> 5109.679
sadistic the media producer the more

5107.04 --> 5113.239
memorable the Mandela

5109.679 --> 5114.36
effect because it all comes from sadism

5113.239 --> 5117.08
Mandela

5114.36 --> 5119.04
effect like that's the only way Mandela

5117.08 --> 5122.6
effect happens is by

5119.04 --> 5125.56
something being done so anesthetically

5122.6 --> 5126.96
pleasing unpleasing it's like super

5125.56 --> 5129.6
unesthetic it's not the way it's

5126.96 --> 5132.679
supposed to be that it literally forces

5129.6 --> 5136.400000000001
everybody's mind collectively to create

5132.679 --> 5141.0
an alternative reality the mask for

5136.4 --> 5141.0
that super terrible

5142.96 --> 5149.4
moment it's like a

5145.639 --> 5153.6
little Stockholm syndrome dream that's

5149.4 --> 5156.44
basically created to mask the ugly

5153.6 --> 5160.56
that's the Mandela effect yeah the ugly

5156.44 --> 5160.5599999999995
was always there on

5181.199 --> 5184.199
purpose

5185.159 --> 5192.199
yeah richy I know it's ridiculous but

5188.4 --> 5194.879999999999
it's that's how powerful it is yeah the

5192.199 --> 5197.919999999999
aesthetic mind correcting the

5194.88 --> 5200.88
version is so

5197.92 --> 5204.0
important it can be like it can fight

5200.88 --> 5205.88
the aesthetic mind will fight the battle

5204.0 --> 5208.199
it's like a little mother inside it's

5205.88 --> 5210.6
like no mother knows best it is that

5208.199 --> 5213.08
better version that's the real

5210.6 --> 5215.4400000000005
version because the mother wants to

5213.08 --> 5218.0
protect you from the horrid reality that

5215.44 --> 5221.48
was always [ __ ] ugly on

5218.0 --> 5223.28
purpose yeah that's mother doing that

5221.48 --> 5227.799999999999
the aesthetic

5223.28 --> 5227.8
mind trying to protect you from the

5233.88 --> 5240.159000000001
ugly they made a Mandela F

5237.159 --> 5240.159
movie

5240.52 --> 5246.639
whatever I don't give a [ __ ] there's a

5243.0 --> 5248.84
lot of stuff with Mandela effect but I

5246.639 --> 5251.719
mean they they just Mandela affected

5248.84 --> 5254.360000000001
away the Mandela effect I mean V effect

5251.719 --> 5258.6
will be forgotten because I

5254.36 --> 5260.96
mean me and not just me but I am very

5258.6 --> 5264.119000000001
proud to be one of the forerunners about

5260.96 --> 5266.0
this on the internet potentially I'm

5264.119 --> 5268.719
very convinced

5266.0 --> 5270.6
about what I explained about the Mandel

5268.719 --> 5274.08
effect how is the aesthetic mind and how

5270.6 --> 5279.04
that process works I'm very very

5274.08 --> 5279.04
confident that I have it 100%

5285.8 --> 5290.320000000001
correct so it's what it

5297.52 --> 5303.080000000001
is right I mean The Logical consequences

5300.84 --> 5305.8
would be that

5303.08 --> 5308.84
this reality is not physically

5305.8 --> 5311.4800000000005
real and that somehow through some

5308.84 --> 5314.679
influence the simulation that we would

5311.48 --> 5318.919999999999
be experiencing can just be universally

5314.679 --> 5323.0
altered by individuals

5318.92 --> 5325.92
somehow to change things for the for the

5323.0 --> 5329.92
ugly to make things more

5325.92 --> 5332.84
ugly yeah I mean how many people even

5329.92 --> 5336.56
like people don't even realize it

5332.84 --> 5340.2390000000005
that nobody

5336.56 --> 5343.92
cares about anything that's

5340.239 --> 5347.638999999999
like hey wait I remember that as being

5343.92 --> 5352.04
really stupid and ugly but the title Now

5347.639 --> 5353.719
is better like the name is improved how

5352.04 --> 5357.639
could it be I was thought it was that

5353.719 --> 5360.28
stupid name and I didn't like it but now

5357.639 --> 5363.6
it's better yeah that never happens it

5360.28 --> 5367.599999999999
does it yeah and D effect is always

5363.6 --> 5372.6
going to be why did they make everything

5367.6 --> 5375.719
ugly it was better than this they ruined

5372.6 --> 5377.76
it yeah it's because it is exclusively

5375.719 --> 5380.92
things that turn out in

5377.76 --> 5383.360000000001
reality to be less aesthetically

5380.92 --> 5385.6
pleasing than you remember them it's

5383.36 --> 5387.639
never the other way around it's never

5385.6 --> 5390.719
like wait I thought it was a lot more

5387.639 --> 5393.36
ugly and unpleasing it turns out to

5390.719 --> 5395.8
actually be better than I thought it was

5393.36 --> 5398.719
yeah that doesn't

5395.8 --> 5400.719
happen it's only like oh damn it I

5398.719 --> 5403.44
thought it was better than

5400.719 --> 5405.52
this that's always what the Mandela

5403.44 --> 5407.759999999999
effect experience is it's never the

5405.52 --> 5411.400000000001
other way around people are never

5407.76 --> 5413.280000000001
astounded about wait man I always

5411.4 --> 5415.44
thought that this was really stupid and

5413.28 --> 5419.28
ugly but it turns out it was better than

5415.44 --> 5423.839999999999
I thought like the name is better

5419.28 --> 5423.84
now like what

5423.92 --> 5430.52
no it's always like why isn't it sound

5428.84 --> 5434.32
correct

5430.52 --> 5437.360000000001
anymore why isn't it just Baron stein

5434.32 --> 5439.799999999999
bears right why is it Baron stain bears

5437.36 --> 5442.5199999999995
like who the [ __ ] calls anything Baron

5439.8 --> 5445.8
stain like who the hell would choose a

5442.52 --> 5449.0
name like that it's [ __ ]

5445.8 --> 5454.2390000000005
[ __ ] it's very unpleasing and like

5449.0 --> 5457.6
who the [ __ ] wants to like use the word

5454.239 --> 5460.159
stain which is like a

5457.6 --> 5464.56
blemish why the [ __ ] would you put that

5460.159 --> 5467.879999999999
in the name nobody wanted to accept that

5464.56 --> 5470.320000000001
well steam is a kind of like a typical

5467.88 --> 5472.36
sort of Jewish name and it's like more

5470.32 --> 5474.4
relatable much more common right it's

5472.36 --> 5477.839999999999
like yeah of course it's Baron Steen

5474.4 --> 5480.599999999999
Bears no it wasn't it was stain and it

5477.84 --> 5482.28
was a [ __ ] butt ugly name that was

5480.6 --> 5484.1990000000005
always [ __ ] ugly

5482.28 --> 5487.44
and people just ignored it because they

5484.199 --> 5489.759999999999
found the content so

5487.44 --> 5492.32
charming and people are like oh it's so

5489.76 --> 5494.84
ugly I'm going to ignore it because it's

5492.32 --> 5496.84
so cool it's so cool like I really like

5494.84 --> 5500.119000000001
the story yeah but it's called Baron

5496.84 --> 5504.400000000001
stain Bears which is [ __ ] atrocious

5500.119 --> 5508.199
yeah but the stories are so cool

5504.4 --> 5508.199
yeah that's how people

5510.76 --> 5514.320000000001
are

5512.56 --> 5516.360000000001
but in their mind everybody thought like

5514.32 --> 5519.28
no it's actually Baron stein bears like

5516.36 --> 5521.5599999999995
nobody wanted it to be called Baron

5519.28 --> 5523.8
stein bears that's why nobody ever

5521.56 --> 5526.119000000001
called it baren stain Bears even though

5523.8 --> 5528.84
that's literally what it was written

5526.119 --> 5533.839999999999
like just nobody wanted to it to be

5528.84 --> 5533.84
called like that because that name

5540.679 --> 5543.679
sucks

5544.48 --> 5549.599999999999
sounds like those of reality could use

5546.719 --> 5549.6
the doery that's

5556.8 --> 5561.320000000001
hilarious it's a half big conspiracy

5561.6 --> 5566.280000000001
indeed but I understand it very

5567.08 --> 5573.84
well and just think of it like where do

5570.92 --> 5577.119
the Mandela effects there's lists right

5573.84 --> 5580.119000000001
there's lists you have the list Mandela

5577.119 --> 5582.5599999999995
effect people oh this this this and this

5580.119 --> 5585.799999999999
and this yeah what are these this and

5582.56 --> 5588.280000000001
this and this is is it

5585.8 --> 5593.400000000001
all

5588.28 --> 5597.84
advertisement big franchise production

5593.4 --> 5600.759999999999
movies yeah could it be that all the

5597.84 --> 5604.360000000001
people that are involved with these

5600.76 --> 5608.1990000000005
supposed Mand effects are all kind of

5604.36 --> 5609.96
sneaky weird bastards that like to [ __ ]

5608.199 --> 5613.678999999999
around with people's

5609.96 --> 5617.96
minds so they just like yeah let's just

5613.679 --> 5621.04
do it they're just just agitated like we

5617.96 --> 5624.159
just take this word as everybody gets it

5621.04 --> 5626.6
this is how everybody wants it to be and

5624.159 --> 5628.92
then we just change it just a little bit

5626.6 --> 5631.04
oh they'll never get over it they'll

5628.92 --> 5633.639
both talking about it and complaining

5631.04 --> 5636.76
about it in

5633.639 --> 5640.32
decades yeah they'll never get the

5636.76 --> 5642.4800000000005
product out of their minds yeah

5640.32 --> 5645.88
that's that's what's

5642.48 --> 5648.36
real that's what they

5645.88 --> 5650.679
did that's what it is this Mandela

5648.36 --> 5654.32
effect is just mind

5650.679 --> 5656.32
control sadistic mind control on purpose

5654.32 --> 5658.5199999999995
by people that understand about the

5656.32 --> 5662.36
aesthetic memory and how it

5658.52 --> 5665.040000000001
corrects ugly things

5662.36 --> 5669.48
and they played around with it see if I

5665.04 --> 5669.48
can [ __ ] around with you and they

5672.48 --> 5677.04
did getting sick Skype oh

5678.04 --> 5684.88
okay seeing this thumbnail yeah it's

5680.8 --> 5684.88
weird getting sick is a bit

5686.52 --> 5693.4800000000005
weird he might have some official

5689.44 --> 5693.48
psychological issues

5699.56 --> 5705.1990000000005
so he's still a cool guy though but he

5702.44 --> 5708.638999999999
has some issues but he's he said that to

5705.199 --> 5708.638999999999
me so

5709.28 --> 5715.32
uh did you see that someone stole a

5712.08 --> 5718.719
stuffed polar bear

5715.32 --> 5718.719
what what the

5720.4 --> 5723.4
hell

5727.719 --> 5731.96
people

5729.199 --> 5735.44
understand yeah well duper flat sight's

5731.96 --> 5735.44
a bit dim like

5735.76 --> 5740.639
that it's what happens when you hang

5738.0 --> 5740.639
around trash

5741.639 --> 5747.119
people you come di I don't understand

5745.239 --> 5750.119
how it couldn't

5747.119 --> 5750.119
be

5750.4 --> 5753.4
right

5758.28 --> 5766.199
but I mean he's also like a

5761.88 --> 5768.84
trinitarian Bible thumping dumbass

5766.199 --> 5771.08
so we says like oh if you don't believe

5768.84 --> 5773.8
this riddle then you are doomed to hell

5771.08 --> 5776.36
and you're with Satan so yeah people

5773.8 --> 5778.4400000000005
that are like that like who can't

5776.36 --> 5780.759999999999
believe how the Mandela effect would be

5778.44 --> 5782.28
dismissed yeah no [ __ ] if you're going

5780.76 --> 5785.320000000001
to believe

5782.28 --> 5788.28
in that [ __ ] yeah then everything else

5785.32 --> 5791.28
is like pretty much up for

5788.28 --> 5791.28
gravs

5801.96 --> 5804.96
yeah

5806.44 --> 5809.759999999999
what oh

5810.28 --> 5813.28
the

5815.52 --> 5819.080000000001
can Leto say

5827.84 --> 5830.84
Mandela

5840.199 --> 5843.199
what

5861.56 --> 5865.76
oh you found his yeah I know what you

5863.88 --> 5868.84
mean though here we go okay I found it

5865.76 --> 5868.84
disturbing too I

5870.199 --> 5874.799999999999
didn't

5872.719 --> 5877.36
I mean I've known guys like that in the

5874.8 --> 5879.96
past that are like

5877.36 --> 5883.239
weird I know this guy that was actually

5879.96 --> 5885.719
kind of nice but he had like weird sex

5883.239 --> 5888.879999999999
addiction with women and all that who

5885.719 --> 5892.84
was like obsessed with his own upper

5888.88 --> 5896.28
body like absolutely obsessed with like

5892.84 --> 5898.639
ridiculously obsessed like every where

5896.28 --> 5900.639
he would just have that [ __ ] picture

5898.639 --> 5902.52
like the latest update of his upper body

5900.639 --> 5905.32
it was like completely retardedly

5902.52 --> 5909.88
obsessed with it there's guys like that

5905.32 --> 5909.88
I think Gideon sck might be one of

5926.8 --> 5933.84
those talking snakes and donkeys nothing

5930.239 --> 5937.04
weird wa

5933.84 --> 5937.04
that's the

5957.08 --> 5963.04
hell

5960.04 --> 5963.04
what

5966.56 --> 5970.96
a bible thumper stopped you on the

5968.48 --> 5973.32
street to read you the Bible yeah that's

5970.96 --> 5973.32
what they

5973.92 --> 5980.0
do I was when they do that with me I'm

5977.56 --> 5981.4800000000005
like so what's your point I just keep

5980.0 --> 5983.719
asking what's your point what's your

5981.48 --> 5985.879999999999
point what's your it's like yeah you can

5983.719 --> 5989.08
literally condense down everything to

5985.88 --> 5991.56
one sentence and stop wasting my [ __ ]

5989.08 --> 5993.96
time like what's your point what is it

5991.56 --> 5993.96
that you

5995.36 --> 6001.0
want I do the same things with like

5999.04 --> 6005.679
Jehovah's Witnesses

6001.0 --> 6007.88
too I'm like let's just get everything

6005.679 --> 6012.1990000000005
out of the way all the padding and just

6007.88 --> 6016.88
like let's get to the point like now

6012.199 --> 6016.879999999999
what is it that you want just say

6019.96 --> 6022.96
it

6023.48 --> 6027.159
he's blocked now oh

6031.48 --> 6037.598999999999
whatever asked me to let him pass and he

6035.04 --> 6042.28
didn't

6037.599 --> 6044.119000000001
okay well in my book you're perfectly

6042.28 --> 6045.119
Justified to just push him out of the

6044.119 --> 6048.88
way

6045.119 --> 6049.598999999999
then I mean don't do it aggressively but

6048.88 --> 6053.4400000000005
just

6049.599 --> 6053.4400000000005
like yeah I'm going

6060.28 --> 6065.5599999999995
through if they're like physically going

6063.199 --> 6068.759999999999
to try to prevent you from moving

6065.56 --> 6071.119000000001
through then I would then it would be

6068.76 --> 6073.1990000000005
justified to like try to put them off

6071.119 --> 6076.92
balance to

6073.199 --> 6079.598999999999
like I don't know tackle them pull them

6076.92 --> 6082.84
off whatever to like get out of my

6079.599 --> 6082.84
freaking way

6085.119 --> 6089.04
anyway they've never done that though

6087.239 --> 6091.159
with

6089.04 --> 6095.239
me I

6091.159 --> 6098.4
mean usually when this B people I just

6095.239 --> 6101.678999999999
look at them like with a rage wi look

6098.4 --> 6101.679
and then they just walk

6102.119 --> 6109.0
away which is what most people do when I

6106.719 --> 6112.0
give them the rage wi look and actually

6109.0 --> 6115.719
look them directly into the eyes face to

6112.0 --> 6118.239
face then they mostly just go

6115.719 --> 6120.4
away but it's never really come to that

6118.239 --> 6122.759999999999
I've had pretty decent experience with

6120.4 --> 6122.759999999999
all the

6130.599 --> 6135.04
Christians I think on average like the

6133.08 --> 6137.0
Christians here that are like seriously

6135.04 --> 6139.599
Christian they're actually like really

6137.0 --> 6139.599
polite

6139.76 --> 6146.159000000001
and behaved like all of them whatever

6144.119 --> 6148.839999999999
Branch they're

6146.159 --> 6150.638999999999
at I find Christians very pleasant

6148.84 --> 6154.88
because of that I find them very

6150.639 --> 6157.84
[ __ ] about things but at least they

6154.88 --> 6160.599
have like this common decency that I

6157.84 --> 6160.599
find very

6162.159 --> 6167.598999999999
pleasant and that I reciprocate just for

6165.44 --> 6167.598999999999
the

6169.76 --> 6172.76
record

6191.76 --> 6197.0
turned you off from reading the Bible

6194.28 --> 6199.88
yeah no it

6197.0 --> 6202.119
should the Bible can be absolutely

6199.88 --> 6206.1990000000005
amazing but it it's

6202.119 --> 6209.199
like it's actually very personal in a

6206.199 --> 6213.08
way it's like your

6209.199 --> 6216.919999999999
personal response to it it's like you

6213.08 --> 6219.88
shouldn't let anybody tell you what it

6216.92 --> 6222.119
means or what is in there really but

6219.88 --> 6224.96
that's maybe just my personal eclectic

6222.119 --> 6228.799999999999
view it's like your own

6224.96 --> 6231.92
personal discovery of

6228.8 --> 6234.8
it like the way you experience it when

6231.92 --> 6236.4800000000005
you read is relatively unique and people

6234.8 --> 6237.96
might have like oh it's this and that

6236.48 --> 6241.04
and you have to do this and that that's

6237.96 --> 6243.96
all nonsense it's like no it's not

6241.04 --> 6245.88
about oh we have to do this and that no

6243.96 --> 6249.28
it's

6245.88 --> 6250.159000000001
about how did you experience this how

6249.28 --> 6253.679
did

6250.159 --> 6257.04
you what are your spiritual experiences

6253.679 --> 6259.599
as you read this like what did you feel

6257.04 --> 6261.44
about what was

6259.599 --> 6264.599
there

6261.44 --> 6269.48
what do you like what do you

6264.599 --> 6273.32
see do you see the Unseen

6269.48 --> 6275.959999999999
things that are described right things

6273.32 --> 6278.0
that you don't really look at the Bible

6275.96 --> 6279.679
when you read it it makes you look at

6278.0 --> 6283.04
certain things

6279.679 --> 6286.119
that are like less materialistic in a

6283.04 --> 6287.84
way and it just makes you look and then

6286.119 --> 6290.239
it's the question like can you actually

6287.84 --> 6292.119000000001
see it so when you look up from the

6290.239 --> 6296.04
Bible now that you've seen it in there

6292.119 --> 6296.04
can you see it in your physical

6296.44 --> 6301.719
reality right it's a personal journey

6299.52 --> 6304.080000000001
and you shouldn't let anybody tell you

6301.719 --> 6304.08
what it

6314.28 --> 6319.599
means hey

6316.159 --> 6323.28
amm ever read the Bible cover to cover

6319.599 --> 6323.28
no not in one go definitely

6332.96 --> 6340.28
not but I mean I've built up a lot of

6335.92 --> 6343.32
reservations about the Bible these days

6340.28 --> 6346.28
so like there's just real big

6343.32 --> 6346.28
complications

6347.04 --> 6353.28
now but I mean like the the esoteric

6350.639 --> 6355.56
confrontation the spiritual things that

6353.28 --> 6357.88
you will experience when you read the

6355.56 --> 6363.56
Bible with an open mind that's still

6357.88 --> 6363.56
there I just I don't think it's historic

6379.4 --> 6382.4
anymore

6385.159 --> 6389.638999999999
what what the hell are you blabbering

6396.199 --> 6401.04
about what the hell does all that mean

6398.52 --> 6401.040000000001
Brianna

6409.4 --> 6412.4
Johnson

6413.239 --> 6418.5599999999995
when you get a PC with a keyboard you

6415.32 --> 6419.96
think I'm a different person okay are

6418.56 --> 6423.1990000000005
you going to get a computer with a

6419.96 --> 6423.199
keyboard I mean that would be

6439.32 --> 6442.32
interesting

6464.28 --> 6467.92
yeah stop it it's

6469.32 --> 6472.32
annoying

6499.239 --> 6502.239
so

6509.28 --> 6514.719
what are you talking about duper getting

6512.119 --> 6514.719
confused

6519.239 --> 6528.199
here you ask who did you

6522.76 --> 6528.1990000000005
ask what a word meant and he didn't

6529.199 --> 6534.5199999999995
know

6531.679 --> 6534.52
who are you talking

6536.08 --> 6542.36
about him who are you talking

6539.36 --> 6542.36
about

6559.119 --> 6562.119
name

6578.159 --> 6581.159
oh

6588.719 --> 6593.32
okay you're still talking about the guy

6591.52 --> 6595.1990000000005
you bumped into on the street with the

6593.32 --> 6599.159
Bible

6595.199 --> 6604.759999999999
okay Steven

6599.159 --> 6608.5599999999995
what Oh you mean good servant stepen

6604.76 --> 6608.56
yeah I mean he still has a

6610.199 --> 6614.36
article he's just on the other

6617.44 --> 6624.44
side I mean you could you can trust me

6621.119 --> 6624.44
if you want he's doing

6632.8 --> 6640.639
great remember when I had my first

6635.4 --> 6640.638999999999
coffee earlier this year or uh last

6640.719 --> 6648.639
year I had this extremely strong vision

6645.119 --> 6651.199
of him and he's in

6648.639 --> 6655.719
heaven just

6651.199 --> 6657.678999999999
walking out there in like the

6655.719 --> 6661.36
Wilds

6657.679 --> 6665.2390000000005
surviving and really crushing at

6661.36 --> 6665.239
it that's what he's doing

6670.0 --> 6676.199
now he's sleeping

6673.199 --> 6676.199
until

6677.079 --> 6681.96
sleeping I mean that is pretty much

6679.56 --> 6681.96
heaven

6684.36 --> 6688.199
and what is after when nobody knows

6686.4 --> 6690.4
right I mean even logically it's like oh

6688.199 --> 6693.159
you be put in the waiting row until

6690.4 --> 6696.199
judgment yeah nobody knows what happens

6693.159 --> 6698.119
yeah this judgment moment when it's all

6696.199 --> 6701.598999999999
going to go to the next St that might

6698.119 --> 6706.48
literally mean we all get wiped yeah

6701.599 --> 6706.4800000000005
that's the thing nobody

6706.719 --> 6710.76
knows

6708.96 --> 6713.4
nobody

6710.76 --> 6719.119000000001
so as far as I'm concerned even

6713.4 --> 6722.119
logically the afterlife dream life the

6719.119 --> 6727.759999999999
suspense it might be all there

6722.119 --> 6729.598999999999
is nobody knows what happens after that

6727.76 --> 6733.1990000000005
is all

6729.599 --> 6736.679
transitioned there's claims about it

6733.199 --> 6740.199
there's just nothing that has actually

6736.679 --> 6742.92
historically logically on record

6740.199 --> 6742.919999999999
experienced

6749.48 --> 6752.48
that

6753.88 --> 6757.92
what what are you talking about here we

6756.04 --> 6763.119
go

6757.92 --> 6763.119
what what are you poking at AGM

6768.84 --> 6771.84
for

6784.36 --> 6789.119
YouTube deleted your two comments what

6786.679 --> 6789.119
did you

6798.76 --> 6801.76
say

6812.079 --> 6814.84
no one did

6814.88 --> 6820.32
anything I don't even understand what

6817.119 --> 6822.679
the hell was going on I mean Steven was

6820.32 --> 6826.159
like not doing

6822.679 --> 6826.159
great at that

6826.44 --> 6832.638999999999
point it's like I talked to him a little

6830.04 --> 6835.119
and he said to me like it felt like his

6832.639 --> 6838.84
Spirit was basically starting to

6835.119 --> 6841.28
collapse like he even described like how

6838.84 --> 6845.56
it felt like he didn't fit his in his

6841.28 --> 6848.759999999999
own body anymore at times that's a bad

6845.56 --> 6850.719
sign it's like a dis that means like a

6848.76 --> 6854.2390000000005
separation like that's what happens

6850.719 --> 6856.119
before death usually so it's always very

6854.239 --> 6858.119
worrisome when somebody says it feels

6856.119 --> 6861.639
like I don't even fit in my own body

6858.119 --> 6864.48
anymore it's like oh

6861.639 --> 6867.4800000000005
okay that's not

6864.48 --> 6871.48
good let's try to fix that now I could

6867.48 --> 6873.759999999999
say like oh wait you what oh okay well

6871.48 --> 6877.44
let's apply the technique then I could

6873.76 --> 6877.4400000000005
potentially now do something about

6878.159 --> 6883.839999999999
it it would have been very interesting

6880.719 --> 6886.88
if I would had known these things

6883.84 --> 6889.88
and maybe attempted some of that on

6886.88 --> 6892.52
Steven but I never had the chance I I

6889.88 --> 6892.52
wasn't there

6899.36 --> 6907.639
yet and his Believers it here we go what

6903.119 --> 6907.639
are you rambling about here we go

6909.44 --> 6918.119
again why are you like doing out guilt

6914.8 --> 6918.119000000001
what's the [ __ ] point of

6918.599 --> 6921.599
this

6923.04 --> 6928.36
happy birthday I'm not it's not my

6925.84 --> 6928.360000000001
birthday

6931.599 --> 6937.4400000000005
yet yeah next Tuesday next week is my

6936.119 --> 6941.04
birthday the

6937.44 --> 6941.04
6th 6th of

6944.52 --> 6950.1990000000005
February but hey you can always give me

6947.199 --> 6952.719
super chats or paypals

6950.199 --> 6952.719
ahead of

6961.719 --> 6964.719
time

6966.28 --> 6972.36
what I'm not here we go again I don't

6970.52 --> 6974.52
know about the rest of the guys in the

6972.36 --> 6977.119
chat here but I literally don't even

6974.52 --> 6980.52
know what you're talking

6977.119 --> 6982.639
about yeah

6980.52 --> 6985.639
what was wrong with Steven was a

6982.639 --> 6988.2390000000005
compounded

6985.639 --> 6991.76
effect I had like

6988.239 --> 6993.5199999999995
very directly connected personal

6991.76 --> 6996.159000000001
sessions with

6993.52 --> 6999.400000000001
him where I talked on high esoteric

6996.159 --> 7001.719
level about his condition and it's like

6999.4 --> 7004.5599999999995
you could not have stopped this from

7001.719 --> 7007.36
happening here we go again and neither

7004.56 --> 7007.360000000001
did anybody

7008.239 --> 7015.718999999999
else he was like on a downward path

7012.52 --> 7022.119000000001
physically and he

7015.719 --> 7022.119
didn't he couldn't find a way to reverse

7022.719 --> 7027.719
that so nothing was going to stop it

7025.44 --> 7030.199
from happening he was physically

7027.719 --> 7031.88
degenerating and like to a point where

7030.199 --> 7034.36
it becomes

7031.88 --> 7037.159000000001
intable okay nothing could have stopped

7034.36 --> 7040.159
that it's not about what other people

7037.159 --> 7042.719
said to him or when they didn't show up

7040.159 --> 7045.759999999999
when he needed attention had absolutely

7042.719 --> 7048.159
nothing to do with his

7045.76 --> 7052.1990000000005
death okay here we go

7048.159 --> 7054.44
again so don't don't don't even think

7052.199 --> 7054.44
like

7055.119 --> 7059.839999999999
that it's nobody's fault that he

7068.4 --> 7071.4
died

7077.28 --> 7083.44
yeah I agree Tommy does need to [ __ ]

7080.079 --> 7083.44
off Take

7098.32 --> 7101.32
Five

7106.639 --> 7111.4400000000005
so yeah everybody in the chat just for

7109.52 --> 7115.400000000001
starters take it easy

7111.44 --> 7116.919999999999
here because it's personal okay here we

7115.4 --> 7120.5199999999995
go again

7116.92 --> 7123.079
like we were me too but here we go again

7120.52 --> 7126.56
probably more and he you're a

7123.079 --> 7130.4
woman very close to here we go again or

7126.56 --> 7132.159000000001
to good servant Steven

7130.4 --> 7134.44
and it was a great it's a great loss to

7132.159 --> 7136.879999999999
him so so no joking around with that

7134.44 --> 7140.96
it's not freaking

7136.88 --> 7144.1990000000005
funny unless you have no problem being

7140.96 --> 7149.159
recognized for

7144.199 --> 7149.159
psychopathy yeah this is entertaining to

7152.199 --> 7157.879999999999
you but I want to emphasize that it

7155.52 --> 7159.92
wasn't anybody's fault he didn't die

7157.88 --> 7162.719
because nobody showed up or something

7159.92 --> 7166.28
that that's just not that's not

7162.719 --> 7166.28
reasonable and it's not

7173.04 --> 7177.639
real rage po what the

7182.639 --> 7189.28
hell are you still talking about the

7185.239 --> 7191.36
Bible guy does the same Bible guy like

7189.28 --> 7194.36
keep coming back to

7191.36 --> 7194.36
you

7197.84 --> 7203.76
duper I mean that is kind of

7200.8 --> 7205.88
weird if a Bible guy keeps coming back

7203.76 --> 7209.1990000000005
to you then he might think that you're

7205.88 --> 7209.1990000000005
actually willing to

7209.88 --> 7214.56
convert it's not really fair to go rage

7213.52 --> 7218.159000000001
on

7214.56 --> 7220.56
him if you're kind of leading him

7218.159 --> 7222.839999999999
on

7220.56 --> 7226.8
that's not fair

7222.84 --> 7226.8
der rage wounds

7232.199 --> 7236.4
yes they let him out too

7236.52 --> 7242.92
soon I

7239.239 --> 7242.919999999999
don't I don't know

7248.119 --> 7251.119
man

7262.159 --> 7266.719
you can see what the person is saying

7267.92 --> 7275.2390000000005
what oh so you blocked her then Brianna

7272.8 --> 7276.92
Johnson if somebody blocks you that

7275.239 --> 7278.759999999999
doesn't mean that you can't see what

7276.92 --> 7281.04
they're saying that only happens if you

7278.76 --> 7281.04
block

7294.8 --> 7299.679
them kept blocking your way but are you

7297.719 --> 7301.84
still talking about One Singular

7299.679 --> 7304.36
situation or does he keep coming back

7301.84 --> 7307.0
and doing

7304.36 --> 7310.96
that he playing like the black knight

7307.0 --> 7314.0
from Monty piton holy grill or

7310.96 --> 7316.4
something just he just won't let you

7314.0 --> 7316.4
pass

7316.639 --> 7321.84
there he keeps coming that is kind of

7319.32 --> 7321.84
creepy

7325.639 --> 7332.0
though so there is something weird about

7328.44 --> 7332.0
that guy

7337.96 --> 7340.96
then

7355.56 --> 7362.079000000001
you don't see

7357.92 --> 7366.8
the how don't you not how don't you see

7362.079 --> 7366.799999999999
a person that's obviously in my

7366.88 --> 7372.88
chat when you don't have them block BL

7369.8 --> 7376.56
explain that to me Ranna how does that

7372.88 --> 7376.56
work that makes no

7377.36 --> 7385.92
sense how wouldn't you be able to see

7381.04 --> 7385.92
the person that you don't have

7389.28 --> 7393.84
blocked I don't know okay so there's

7392.0 --> 7396.28
just something weird going on that makes

7393.84 --> 7398.4800000000005
no damn sense or maybe you do have them

7396.28 --> 7401.96
blocked you just didn't take the effort

7398.48 --> 7401.959999999999
to actually check your block

7422.84 --> 7430.88
list you do not disclose that

7427.04 --> 7430.88
information yeah

7436.119 --> 7439.598999999999
you don't know if you have a

7440.079 --> 7444.84
block everybody has a block list I mean

7443.079 --> 7447.679
you might not have anybody in there but

7444.84 --> 7450.639
you definitely have a block list if you

7447.679 --> 7453.2390000000005
have a YouTube account you have a block

7501.44 --> 7506.558999999999
other than that he blocks your way and

7503.28 --> 7506.559
trying to make you read the

7506.84 --> 7510.599

7551.76 --> 7559.320000000001
a a Bible thumping Heckler

7554.48 --> 7559.32
then does the police know about

7562.079 --> 7567.32
him I mean if that gu actually

7565.52 --> 7569.8
continually doing that I wouldn't be

7567.32 --> 7572.96
surprised if he would end up a night in

7569.8 --> 7575.119000000001
jail at some point it's like yeah you've

7572.96 --> 7577.96
been harassing the wrong

7575.119 --> 7581.598999999999
person like now you're they actually

7577.96 --> 7581.599
filed the a a

7582.159 --> 7589.44
report get a ma spray dude no that's

7585.559 --> 7592.4800000000005
just that's just and that's illegal

7589.44 --> 7594.48
too you can't just ma

7592.48 --> 7597.4
somebody because they're blocking your

7594.48 --> 7597.4
way that's

7598.8 --> 7605.88
assault they'd have to actually grab you

7603.76 --> 7609.159000000001
at

7605.88 --> 7612.36
least or like blatantly assault you or

7609.159 --> 7614.48
try to tackle you or something you can't

7612.36 --> 7617.0
just ma somebody because they're in the

7614.48 --> 7620.28
way that's you'll get

7617.0 --> 7620.28
arrested that's

7637.52 --> 7641.639
everywhere

7640.0 --> 7644.079
right if you push somebody out of the

7641.639 --> 7644.079
way

7645.76 --> 7653.04
that's that's less dangerous that's

7649.639 --> 7656.559
legally less risky if you just mace

7653.04 --> 7658.559
somebody or like tase it that's like you

7656.559 --> 7662.96
will get in trouble for that never do

7658.559 --> 7662.96
that unless they like actually assault

7667.52 --> 7670.52
you

7682.0 --> 7690.199
kept doing it then they need to be sh

7686.079 --> 7693.0
can do it no Brianna it all depends on

7690.199 --> 7695.0
the context look if somebody's like if

7693.0 --> 7697.44
you feel like oh this person is like

7695.0 --> 7701.04
trying to rape me or

7697.44 --> 7704.04
something there is some kind of logic

7701.04 --> 7706.5199999999995
behind you doing that if they're just

7704.04 --> 7708.4
being really annoying trying to sell you

7706.52 --> 7710.360000000001
the Bible and like getting in your way

7708.4 --> 7712.799999999999
that's not the same thing they're like

7710.36 --> 7715.719
obviously not actually threatening you

7712.8 --> 7718.599
they're just hackling you that's that's

7715.719 --> 7718.599
a different

7727.4 --> 7730.4
thing

7733.079 --> 7738.92
all right and like even if whatever

7735.92 --> 7741.84
reason you would use it mace or whatever

7738.92 --> 7743.36
you have to warn them it's like okay I'm

7741.84 --> 7745.119000000001
sick of this guy today I'm not going to

7743.36 --> 7746.759999999999
be blocked and you're like as you walk

7745.119 --> 7749.0
over you have the maze in your hand and

7746.76 --> 7751.8
you you have to tell them at a distance

7749.0 --> 7755.079
like get out of my way if you try to

7751.8 --> 7756.1990000000005
block me I will Ma you you must warn

7755.079 --> 7759.96
them

7756.199 --> 7762.879999999999
then you can't just out of nowhere do

7759.96 --> 7766.32
that that would be

7762.88 --> 7771.2390000000005
assault I don't know

7766.32 --> 7773.199
I I'm spitballing here consult a lawyer

7771.239 --> 7775.759999999999
if you actually want to consider doing

7773.199 --> 7778.0
any of this in

7775.76 --> 7780.599
reality it might work different from

7778.0 --> 7780.599
region to

7782.96 --> 7788.28
region he does it with others oh wow

7786.32 --> 7789.5199999999995
he's got a little gang a little chrisan

7788.28 --> 7792.5199999999995
chrisan

7789.52 --> 7792.52
gang

7794.04 --> 7799.48
huh I don't know here we go again but

7796.92 --> 7804.639
that definitely doesn't require you to

7799.48 --> 7804.638999999999
use all caps in my chat for that

7812.92 --> 7819.04
thanks whoa wow I can't believe I've

7816.199 --> 7821.44
been going for over two hours

7819.04 --> 7823.28
it feels like did I get through the

7821.44 --> 7827.119
first hour

7823.28 --> 7827.119
yet it's already two

7835.679 --> 7838.679
hours

7842.88 --> 7849.8
what how

7845.76 --> 7853.8
sign here we go are you hi or something

7849.8 --> 7853.8
what the hell are you blabbering

7856.159 --> 7862.759999999999
about yep oh well please shut up then

7860.719 --> 7866.199
yeah I don't need your high

7862.76 --> 7866.1990000000005
ramblings in my

7874.76 --> 7878.719
chat getting re warning and start the

7877.079 --> 7880.84
content Z

7878.719 --> 7883.8
okay duper whatever you need but I mean

7880.84 --> 7888.679
it just sounds like it's

7883.8 --> 7891.360000000001
a religious blockade type person so it's

7888.679 --> 7892.8
just like you got to find a logistical

7891.36 --> 7896.799999999999
solution to

7892.8 --> 7899.4400000000005
it isn't that like does he have like a

7896.8 --> 7901.400000000001
real smart point where you there's no

7899.44 --> 7904.919999999999
other way to get around

7901.4 --> 7907.638999999999
it does do those those Christian guys

7904.92 --> 7909.719
like hold you up at a choke point in the

7907.639 --> 7912.04
logistics that you can't find a way

7909.719 --> 7912.04
around

7912.679 --> 7919.4400000000005
it like if they would be always standing

7916.76 --> 7922.320000000001
on the one and only Bridge you can go

7919.44 --> 7924.879999999999
across right like

7922.32 --> 7926.799999999999
that cuz then it's going to be really

7924.88 --> 7929.52
problematic but otherwise I just say

7926.8 --> 7931.559
like just try to find find a way around

7929.52 --> 7933.84
I mean it's much better than going to

7931.559 --> 7937.320000000001
have to like physically go through them

7933.84 --> 7939.599
every time you know if you can just find

7937.32 --> 7943.44
a way around it just do

7939.599 --> 7943.4400000000005
that avoid them all

7948.199 --> 7954.48
together there's another rout next well

7950.44 --> 7954.48
there you go just pick the other rout

7955.76 --> 7961.8
then that's much

7958.44 --> 7961.799999999999
handier much

7967.04 --> 7970.04
safer

7982.8 --> 7988.360000000001
you don't go to that same road again

7985.199 --> 7991.558999999999
right or maybe you want to check out if

7988.36 --> 7994.799999999999
they're still doing it one time right I

7991.559 --> 7997.719
mean it is you face them you might have

7994.8 --> 8000.92
later Curiosities like maybe you wanted

7997.719 --> 8004.2390000000005
that it out want to see if like if you

8000.92 --> 8005.88
can hold your own against them like

8004.239 --> 8009.44
spiritually

8005.88 --> 8012.079
intellectually but not

8009.44 --> 8014.96
now but now you have a potential

8012.079 --> 8017.0
challenge you could walk up

8014.96 --> 8019.36
to why

8017.0 --> 8022.44
not but it's great that there's just

8019.36 --> 8024.92
another way you could go so you can just

8022.44 --> 8026.96
avoid them alog

8024.92 --> 8028.719
together you

8026.96 --> 8032.88
know

8028.719 --> 8032.88
building there is like a crazy house

8056.88 --> 8059.88
okay

8085.719 --> 8089.88
right I'm going to take a two-minute

8086.96 --> 8089.88
break and I'll be right

8116.8 --> 8119.8
back

8136.37 --> 8140.58
[Music]

8184.0 --> 8186.52
and I'm

8190.119 --> 8198.479
back let's change topic yeah do

8194.439 --> 8198.479000000001
it by by

8203.28 --> 8208.519
who right so yeah I could do another

8206.319 --> 8211.24
hour potenti

8208.519 --> 8213.359
if there's an interesting subject or I

8211.24 --> 8216.0
could just round out at any moment it

8213.359 --> 8216.0
all depends

8216.12 --> 8222.519
on what you're bringing to the table

8218.639 --> 8222.518999999998
here what I could expound

8235.76 --> 8239.599
upon what

8265.639 --> 8269.598999999998
visit family on Tuesday next week

8276.92 --> 8282.319
no maybe I'll get phone calls that would

8279.8 --> 8282.319
be kind of

8283.399 --> 8290.16
nice I'm sure my dad's going to call me

8287.439 --> 8294.92
up maybe my friend from

8290.16 --> 8294.92
n but I mean no other than

8296.0 --> 8300.92
that like I'm not going to make rounds

8299.359 --> 8304.84
on the

8300.92 --> 8308.12
train yeah on my birthday thanks I mean

8304.84 --> 8309.8
if I'd had a car yeah then

8308.12 --> 8312.479000000001
maybe

8309.8 --> 8315.0
like maybe that could be

8312.479 --> 8318.84
nice I'm definitely not going to make

8315.0 --> 8322.719
rounds through the railway system thanks

8318.84 --> 8322.719000000001
and spend lots of money doing that

8326.519 --> 8329.519
too

8338.0 --> 8342.319
you're rubbish at sending cards I don't

8340.319 --> 8345.8
send

8342.319 --> 8345.8
cards I'm

8346.559 --> 8352.358999999999
really I don't have really any family

8349.479 --> 8352.358999999999
traditions right

8356.439 --> 8359.439
now

8369.319 --> 8377.24
well except for the Christmas

8373.639 --> 8377.24
thing once a

8381.41 --> 8384.479
[Music]

8386.439 --> 8389.439
year

8392.24 --> 8396.119999999999
trains is getting pricey yeah it's all

8393.76 --> 8398.880000000001
getting pricey but the point is is that

8396.12 --> 8402.28
it's just very

8398.88 --> 8406.039999999999
inconvenient like the train takes too

8402.28 --> 8411.08
long like you can accidentally like Miss

8406.04 --> 8411.080000000002
trains and make just everything very

8414.76 --> 8420.2
annoying no my brother does not come

8417.12 --> 8423.84
this see me on my birthday I mean he's

8420.2 --> 8430.04
never ever done that in my

8423.84 --> 8430.04
life so no hey Mojo good to see you

8446.319 --> 8449.319
man

8471.72 --> 8477.08
by the way I'm

8474.2 --> 8480.16
just can't believe the Winter's already

8477.08 --> 8480.16
like almost

8483.399 --> 8490.479
over but I can even now already feel

8487.76 --> 8493.399
like the early early

8490.479 --> 8496.0
Sprouts of spring energy I can already

8493.399 --> 8498.56
feel it a little bit it's just still

8496.0 --> 8502.56
like on hold it's not enough to get

8498.56 --> 8505.8
momentum but I can already feel it right

8502.56 --> 8508.08
now by the way that's very typical in a

8505.8 --> 8509.88
way I I usually have that

8508.08 --> 8513.319
around my

8509.88 --> 8513.319
birthday in that

8513.52 --> 8518.560000000001
week it's like my birthday is always at

8516.16 --> 8523.24
the time when it's like winter is just

8518.56 --> 8523.24
about to when it starts

8536.16 --> 8539.16
ending

8541.56 --> 8547.399

yuck

8580.359 --> 8584.16

8588.28 --> 8593.560000000001
PayPal support in the next week and then

8591.24 --> 8596.08
I probably won't be and I'll be lucky to

8593.56 --> 8599.08

8596.08 --> 8599.08
meal

8610.88 --> 8617.88

what

8656.0 --> 8659.0
right

8705.319 --> 8713.64
what something weird happening with

8708.84 --> 8713.64
GTI it's never been stuck this

8715.439 --> 8721.2
long weird

8717.399 --> 8723.0
I hope it's not g to explode like

8721.2 --> 8725.2
implode or

8723.0 --> 8727.84
something there does seem something

8725.2 --> 8727.84
weird going

8729.279 --> 8736.24
on it's never been

8732.04 --> 8736.240000000002
this in active for this

8745.88 --> 8748.88

8768.479 --> 8774.8
is inactive good here yeah GTI like this

8772.16 --> 8778.8
you don't know anything about that

8774.8 --> 8783.16
anyway it's just this Crypt thing that's

8778.8 --> 8786.16
that I've been sort of using for 10

8783.16 --> 8786.16
years

8790.56 --> 8796.199999999999
and yeah it's just been like not rolling

8793.92 --> 8796.2
as

8798.399 --> 8804.278999999999
much and that's weird I've never had

8801.52 --> 8806.560000000001
like no activity happen for 5 days in a

8804.279 --> 8808.92
row that's never happened in like 10

8806.56 --> 8811.039999999999
years so that's kind of

8808.92 --> 8813.92
weird that's not

8811.04 --> 8818.640000000001
entirely 10 years ago that would

8813.92 --> 8822.439
happen but not in the last few years no

8818.64 --> 8822.439
I don't get a monthly

8822.88 --> 8827.759999999998
[Music]

8824.84 --> 8829.6
salary if I got a monthly salary from

8827.76 --> 8832.56
that I wouldn't be living off social

8829.6 --> 8832.56
welfare now would

8835.72 --> 8838.72
I

8839.6 --> 8844.0
yeah it isn't that's not what it is

8841.52 --> 8844.0
Rihanna

8852.16 --> 8855.16
Johnson

8860.08 --> 8868.68
yeah this is what it is and not anything

8865.68 --> 8868.68
else

8871.12 --> 8876.560000000001
I I don't care for the freaking ratings

8873.92 --> 8880.56
or your judgments or anything or you

8876.56 --> 8880.56
even like oh it's the samam yeah

8895.64 --> 8898.64
whatever

8901.6 --> 8906.479000000001
no it's not one of those

8903.56 --> 8909.399
cryptocurrencies like GTI is the

8906.479 --> 8912.278999999999
umbrella for the whole thing it's the

8909.399 --> 8914.358999999999
system they have all they have like

8912.279 --> 8917.04
three different types of crypto that are

8914.359 --> 8917.04
tied into

8920.319 --> 8928.039999999999
it I don't understand any of

8925.6 --> 8930.08
it

8928.04 --> 8934.960000000001
I don't even understand what the hell

8930.08 --> 8934.96
these things are doing and why it works

8935.72 --> 8945.319
okay I just know it produces token

8941.08 --> 8949.439
stuff and I can't exchange it for a

8945.319 --> 8952.92
cashable crypto yet without a huge

8949.439 --> 8957.2
hassle but the production of these

8952.92 --> 8960.68
tokens in my personal account is

8957.2 --> 8963.6
up like I've been working on it like a

8960.68 --> 8966.68
computer game like playing a game that

8963.6 --> 8970.880000000001
you actually play like pretty much every

8966.68 --> 8974.92
day for almost 10 years so

8970.88 --> 8977.358999999999
yeah it's really beefed up it's just

8974.92 --> 8979.399
that I can't actually turn any of it

8977.359 --> 8982.04
into

8979.399 --> 8985.358999999999
money

8982.04 --> 8988.160000000002
yet and it might never become a durable

8985.359 --> 8992.720000000001
setup where I can actually do

8988.16 --> 8996.119999999999
that but it might I just might it's just

8992.72 --> 8998.76
completely I can't

8996.12 --> 9001.560000000001
tell that crypto stuff is kind of hard

8998.76 --> 9001.56
to use yeah no

9013.0 --> 9018.52
[ __ ]

9015.439 --> 9021.24
what it's like a computer what the [ __ ]

9018.52 --> 9025.0
does that mean

9021.24 --> 9028.08
clammy what kind of a [ __ ] smart ass

9025.0 --> 9031.92
for like what who the [ __ ] are you

9028.08 --> 9031.92
clammy why do you say these

9045.439 --> 9048.439
things

9049.439 --> 9057.04
why I want an explanation why you say

9053.16 --> 9057.039999999999
these things in my chat

9075.359 --> 9078.359
glammy

9103.24 --> 9109.64
but it is kind of weird if it's really

9105.64 --> 9115.64
true that it's been updated in

9109.64 --> 9115.64
2022 had no idea that it's been over a

9117.2 --> 9124.16
year there's some weird things that have

9120.2 --> 9127.12
taken my notice there so I don't know

9124.16 --> 9127.119999999999
what's going on with

9135.279 --> 9138.279
it

9146.359 --> 9152.720000000001
okay so clammy could you please

9149.92 --> 9157.12
elaborate why the hell you would say

9152.72 --> 9159.96
something like that in my chat I want a

9157.12 --> 9163.479000000001
explanation for these types of things

9159.96 --> 9163.479
that you say in my

9165.24 --> 9168.24
chat

9170.92 --> 9176.92
you're always like playing nice but then

9174.359 --> 9181.800000000001
you just say things that make me like

9176.92 --> 9185.24
really distrust you why do you do that

9181.8 --> 9185.24
what are you doing

9186.68 --> 9190.68
here I want an answer

9195.16 --> 9198.16
clammy

9205.399 --> 9209.319
just trying to be but do you actually

9207.68 --> 9213.04
think about what it is that you're

9209.319 --> 9213.039999999999
saying when you try to be

9216.96 --> 9225.16
supportive like what is supportive about

9221.319 --> 9228.16
what you just said how is that

9225.16 --> 9228.16
supportive

9229.16 --> 9233.92
you know what it sounds like to me a

9231.56 --> 9236.88
troll being

9233.92 --> 9239.56
sarcastic and then laughing in the

9236.88 --> 9243.119999999999
background over

9239.56 --> 9248.039999999999
it because it's presented in a

9243.12 --> 9252.399000000001
ridiculous way yeah something not being

9248.04 --> 9256.240000000002
updated for over a year has absolutely

9252.399 --> 9259.519999999999
no it's the opposite of what generally

9256.24 --> 9261.72
would be considered as legitimate yeah

9259.52 --> 9265.439
something working like a computer game

9261.72 --> 9271.76
has absolutely nothing to do with any

9265.439 --> 9271.76
sense of legitimacy why did you say

9277.8 --> 9283.278999999999
that I don't [ __ ] trust you anymore

9281.12 --> 9288.08
when you do like that yeah trink to be

9283.279 --> 9288.08
support no you're being a [ __ ] troll

9309.2 --> 9315.279
why if I find any more of these

9312.279 --> 9317.16
completely unreasonable supportive

9315.279 --> 9319.92
statements I will kick you the [ __ ] out

9317.16 --> 9323.279
because I don't trust people that talk

9319.92 --> 9323.279
like that

9335.24 --> 9338.24
ever

9344.72 --> 9352.72
what okay that's weird Mark Bel me

9349.68 --> 9356.24
thanks for sharing that so yeah crypto

9352.72 --> 9356.24
is not really regarded as

9356.399 --> 9362.439
something that is like universally

9359.479 --> 9362.438999999998
trustable I

9364.76 --> 9369.56
know so that the website is stable

9367.399 --> 9373.68
enough that it doesn't need oh okay

9369.56 --> 9373.68
clammy I didn't think of it like

9374.439 --> 9377.92
that good point

9380.68 --> 9387.279
that's yeah okay that there you actually

9384.2 --> 9390.479000000001
make a fair point I hadn't considered

9387.279 --> 9393.08
that I mean it is stable

9390.479 --> 9397.358999999999
enough to keep where but I mean their

9393.08 --> 9399.76
whole project is like very Advanced

9397.359 --> 9403.04
programs it's Advanced the whole thing

9399.76 --> 9404.880000000001
is very Advanced programming and

9403.04 --> 9407.880000000001
everything

9404.88 --> 9407.88
like

9408.2 --> 9414.240000000002
they were early about like the AI

9411.0 --> 9414.24
Dynamics very

9422.16 --> 9427.72
early right but the point is like GTI

9424.96 --> 9430.64
coins you can't use them for a trade

9427.72 --> 9432.358999999999
like nobody trades them ever you got to

9430.64 --> 9437.479
find a

9432.359 --> 9439.720000000001
Coin that will trade for it

9437.479 --> 9443.679999999998
or have a system to transform it like

9439.72 --> 9447.599999999999
usdt the Tron tokens but that takes a

9443.68 --> 9450.720000000001
lot of time to do that and to do it fast

9447.6 --> 9453.6
you have to actually pay freaking cash

9450.72 --> 9456.16
money to do it fast and that sucks I

9453.6 --> 9458.6
don't have that and then like you still

9456.16 --> 9458.6
have to

9462.399 --> 9471.84
wait so it's like not very very flexible

9467.359 --> 9474.24
right now but they could I mean they do

9471.84 --> 9476.84
these kinds of things at jti These Guys

9474.24 --> 9479.279
these programmers they do actually like

9476.84 --> 9482.72
relay how it works and there could be

9479.279 --> 9485.2
like a standardized usdt system in there

9482.72 --> 9488.438999999998
that you don't have to wait

9485.2 --> 9491.960000000001
years before you get more of that right

9488.439 --> 9493.279
because usdt you can actually like sell

9491.96 --> 9497.08
that for

9493.279 --> 9499.12
cash banks will actually do that not

9497.08 --> 9501.8
with the GTI based

9499.12 --> 9505.0
tokens right so that's kind of like the

9501.8 --> 9508.278999999999
waiting Point that's like yeah I'm

9505.0 --> 9512.12
waiting until it finally becomes more

9508.279 --> 9515.880000000001
doable but G have undergone a

9512.12 --> 9518.08
wide spread set of Transformations and

9515.88 --> 9520.64
reconstructions from the bottom up like

9518.08 --> 9524.0
it has gone through many complete

9520.64 --> 9525.76
transformations in like last 10 years it

9524.0 --> 9527.52
looks completely different from what

9525.76 --> 9530.04
what it was at

9527.52 --> 9535.08
first it didn't start out with any kind

9530.04 --> 9535.080000000002
of cryptocurrency systems in there at

9546.64 --> 9551.88
all all

9549.2 --> 9553.359
right okay so fair enough clamy I take

9551.88 --> 9556.399
it

9553.359 --> 9562.08
back but seriously sometimes you say

9556.399 --> 9562.08
things that just seem so suspicious man

9574.56 --> 9580.64
just baby satosi

9578.64 --> 9584.479
Nakamoto

9580.64 --> 9588.199999999999
uh no I don't think

9584.479 --> 9590.438999999998
so where where is the GTI based out of I

9588.2 --> 9590.439
think

9595.439 --> 9599.56
Dubai I think that's where their

9597.399 --> 9602.479
headquarters is or that's where the

9599.56 --> 9602.479
servers are or

9614.56 --> 9617.56
whatever

9621.0 --> 9625.359
I know he's the person that did Bitcoin

9622.96 --> 9625.358999999999
he's not

9631.64 --> 9635.96
involved lots of money in yeah I

9644.52 --> 9647.52
know

9649.88 --> 9653.8
but I mean look I don't know what's even

9652.319 --> 9657.72
going to happen if there's really going

9653.8 --> 9661.519999999999
to be a kind of World War III overhaul

9657.72 --> 9663.399
in the world that means also banking

9661.52 --> 9666.2
complete

9663.399 --> 9669.92
reconstitution like that's probably what

9666.2 --> 9672.640000000001
will happen I don't know like it if G is

9669.92 --> 9676.0
even going to be functional after that

9672.64 --> 9678.599999999999
right I mean if literally the thing it's

9676.0 --> 9681.2
all resting on to be able to do

9678.6 --> 9683.08
anything it's suddenly all swept away

9681.2 --> 9685.68
who knows that it's going to be able to

9683.08 --> 9689.16
land back on whatever is going to be

9685.68 --> 9691.08
replacing it yeah I mean if there's like

9689.16 --> 9693.92
the what do you call that

9691.08 --> 9696.16
esgs and all that the digital currency

9693.92 --> 9700.92
and all that if that's going to be

9696.16 --> 9702.92
suddenly Universal then GTI all becomes

9700.92 --> 9704.439
worthless there's nothing you can do

9702.92 --> 9707.279
with it

9704.439 --> 9710.6
then I

9707.279 --> 9713.92
think unless they figure out a way to do

9710.6 --> 9716.960000000001
that but I mean I I don't know if they

9713.92 --> 9719.08
could do that wouldn't be hilarious

9716.96 --> 9721.0
though it's like oh esg's oh everybody

9719.08 --> 9723.479
has their own credit score and then just

9721.0 --> 9727.279
like yeah we could just make credit out

9723.479 --> 9731.0
of that like yeah oh but but we didn't

9727.279 --> 9734.24
give you that like yeah but we made it

9731.0 --> 9735.56
we can just make our own ESG currency

9734.24 --> 9738.24
through the other platform there's

9735.56 --> 9740.56
nothing you can do to stop it like yeah

9738.24 --> 9744.0
you can restrict the currency that you

9740.56 --> 9746.278999999999
give us from the ESG but we can make our

9744.0 --> 9749.16
own and we can do with that whatever we

9746.279 --> 9751.92
want and you can't stop us that might

9749.16 --> 9753.08
happen that would be freaking hilarious

9751.92 --> 9755.8
if that would happen that would be

9753.08 --> 9760.319
pretty brilliant

9755.8 --> 9763.399
really and I mean GTI the guys that have

9760.319 --> 9765.76
been managing and like designing it

9763.399 --> 9767.8
they're smart enough to be a able to

9765.76 --> 9770.359
figure such things out so they might be

9767.8 --> 9772.119999999999
able to do that if it ever gets to that

9770.359 --> 9776.52
point if there is going to be like an

9772.12 --> 9776.52
ESG worldwide currency overhaul

9777.04 --> 9782.92
and right which would obviously be an

9780.24 --> 9786.92
attempt to enslave everybody to the

9782.92 --> 9787.8
bankers directly but there might even be

9786.92 --> 9791.319
ways

9787.8 --> 9794.08
out if that happens and GTI could

9791.319 --> 9796.84
potentially be one of those

9794.08 --> 9800.64
ways but you don't

9796.84 --> 9802.56
know until it happens if it

9800.64 --> 9804.08
happens I personally I don't think

9802.56 --> 9806.119999999999
they're going to make it I don't think

9804.08 --> 9809.2
that's ESG is going to happen they're

9806.12 --> 9812.0
just like they're just desperately

9809.2 --> 9815.0
staring at it because they think that

9812.0 --> 9817.64
they can then avoid the total collapse

9815.0 --> 9821.12
of the US dollar

9817.64 --> 9824.278999999999
Etc and it's like is just hopeful

9821.12 --> 9827.279
thinking I don't think they could make

9824.279 --> 9827.279
it

9827.52 --> 9830.84
like it's just going to

9830.96 --> 9836.438999999998
collapse all those bubbles are just

9833.399 --> 9837.88
going to pop and then like after that

9836.439 --> 9840.880000000001
there is technically not even going to

9837.88 --> 9843.479
be a need for esgs anymore like the ESG

9840.88 --> 9846.438999999998
was just always going to be a giant ens

9843.479 --> 9849.56
slavery distraction to make everybody's

9846.439 --> 9854.04
attention go away from that

9849.56 --> 9856.88
cataclysmically inflated debt that is

9854.04 --> 9859.359
unpayable yeah it was always just a

9856.88 --> 9861.0
distraction away from that well it's not

9859.359 --> 9862.84
working like even if they get it

9861.0 --> 9865.52
manifested it's not going to then

9862.84 --> 9867.8
prevent the attention from being on this

9865.52 --> 9869.479000000001
cataclysmic amount of debt that is

9867.8 --> 9872.358999999999
unpayable

9869.479 --> 9875.08
like nothing can stop that

9872.359 --> 9877.399000000001
now not even a freaking introduction of

9875.08 --> 9880.279
esgs is not going to help even if they

9877.399 --> 9880.278999999999
would be able to do

9884.16 --> 9889.039999999999
it

9886.6 --> 9891.52
can you use gifts and go money to help

9889.04 --> 9893.960000000001
convert GTI

9891.52 --> 9898.0
crypto technically that would be

9893.96 --> 9901.08
possible but no not really like

9898.0 --> 9903.479
literally that's not worth it it's

9901.08 --> 9905.64
literally not worth

9903.479 --> 9908.599999999999
it

9905.64 --> 9910.96
like if I had a lot of income then I

9908.6 --> 9914.08
might be like H maybe I'll set like a

9910.96 --> 9919.72
hundred bucks aside for that maybe

9914.08 --> 9919.72
more I don't have that luxury right now

9924.52 --> 9929.399000000001
okay I like the idea of it it's like

9927.439 --> 9932.04
yeah if I had a lot of money I could do

9929.399 --> 9935.24
a lot of things and invest in potential

9932.04 --> 9940.12
future things for myself yeah but I

9935.24 --> 9940.119999999999
don't have a lot to invest so I can't do

9940.319 --> 9946.56
that I'll just have to settle with being

9943.6 --> 9949.880000000001
very happy and thankful that I'll be

9946.56 --> 9953.039999999999
able to eat next week and hey I'm all

9949.88 --> 9954.88
good with that like I'm literally like

9953.04 --> 9958.640000000001
starting to accept more and more that's

9954.88 --> 9961.56
just like yeah no it is okay I no longer

9958.64 --> 9963.8
have to panic for not being certain

9961.56 --> 9966.439
whether I'm going to be eating next week

9963.8 --> 9968.84
like I'm not allowing myself to panic

9966.439 --> 9973.2
over it anymore I just have to be

9968.84 --> 9976.16
thankful it's like be thankful or

9973.2 --> 9979.12
die that's where I'm at right now if I'm

9976.16 --> 9981.279
not thankful I'll stress myself out to

9979.12 --> 9982.319000000001
the breaking point and then everything

9981.279 --> 9986.279
falls

9982.319 --> 9989.96
apart especially my cognitive

9986.279 --> 9992.84
grip so it's literally now come to that

9989.96 --> 9995.039999999999
point where hey everybody's poor

9992.84 --> 9996.56
everybody wants to help but nobody seems

9995.04 --> 9998.560000000001
to really be able to help out

9996.56 --> 10001.08
financially that much I mean some of you

9998.56 --> 10003.72
do really help really thankful that you

10001.08 --> 10007.84
do is just I'm just barely making it

10003.72 --> 10011.599999999999
every time barely if if at

10007.84 --> 10015.2
all almost making it it's rather better

10011.6 --> 10019.319
designation it's better way to describe

10015.2 --> 10023.720000000001
it right but I mean if I'm just not

10019.319 --> 10023.72
really happy about still being able to

10026.08 --> 10032.0
go then it's just looking like [ __ ] and

10029.52 --> 10034.52
poverty and it's all doomed so I'm like

10032.0 --> 10036.88
I'm just really happy I'm able to be

10034.52 --> 10039.720000000001
extreme ex thankful for whatever I got

10036.88 --> 10039.72
and whatever I'm

10040.16 --> 10049.08
getting and that is my strategy now it's

10044.359 --> 10052.68
like yeah I'll just have to settle for

10049.08 --> 10055.12
scraps and I'm going to be thankful to

10052.68 --> 10055.12
God for

10063.92 --> 10066.92
that

10070.479 --> 10073.92
what gzilla

10075.68 --> 10083.479000000001
lion in the lamb yeah but the lion in

10079.279 --> 10086.800000000001
The Lamb is a culturally implanted

10083.479 --> 10089.039999999999
alternative idea it was always a

10086.8 --> 10092.679999999998
competition to the

10089.04 --> 10093.640000000001
Bible yeah lion in the lamp isn't from

10092.68 --> 10098.479000000001
the

10093.64 --> 10098.479
Bible it it's an alternative

10101.04 --> 10106.52
idea I can't even like cite it right I

10104.399 --> 10109.358999999999
don't even know where I know it this is

10106.52 --> 10113.439
my intuition I know it's from another

10109.359 --> 10116.04
thing another Legend another book

10113.439 --> 10118.68
another idea and that idea was really

10116.04 --> 10121.84
pushed especially through media through

10118.68 --> 10125.960000000001
music there's a literal song about

10121.84 --> 10129.0
it it's not from the Bible

10125.96 --> 10133.72
they like they wanted to sneak it

10129.0 --> 10135.88
in under a false guise of biblical in a

10133.72 --> 10138.56
time where Christians were still like oh

10135.88 --> 10142.479
it's Christian oh I'll support

10138.56 --> 10142.479
that they sneaked it

10145.04 --> 10151.0
in yeah the wolf and the Sheep it's

10148.92 --> 10152.56
almost like a metaphor for Wolf and

10151.0 --> 10155.04
sheep's

10152.56 --> 10158.56
clothing they do the wolf and the she

10155.04 --> 10162.359
sheep whatever The Lion and the

10158.56 --> 10164.68
lamb and it's literally a trick like are

10162.359 --> 10165.92
you going to be fooled in thinking that

10164.68 --> 10169.08
this is

10165.92 --> 10171.2
biblical that's what they do it's what

10169.08 --> 10176.0
the Grabbers do it's the same as the

10171.2 --> 10179.0
Mandela effect people they're always

10176.0 --> 10183.279
testing whether you actually know what

10179.0 --> 10185.359
is real in the Bible Etc or if you are

10183.279 --> 10188.6
led by

10185.359 --> 10190.239
autopilot in which aesthetic memory is

10188.6 --> 10193.239
just fully

10190.239 --> 10196.239
exploitable because you don't know the

10193.239 --> 10199.039999999999
difference between your atic memory and

10196.239 --> 10201.279
reality and that's being

10199.04 --> 10206.720000000001
exploited by

10201.279 --> 10206.720000000001
persistant confusing misinformation

10206.84 --> 10213.08
placement L and the lamb everybody

10210.08 --> 10215.76
thinks it's biblical it isn't but they

10213.08 --> 10218.399
pushed it Forward making it seem like

10215.76 --> 10222.16
Christian so everybody would associate

10218.399 --> 10225.88
that even harder when it was never there

10222.16 --> 10225.88
l in the lamb was never in the

10232.64 --> 10240.199999999999
Bible right but it's ideal why is it

10236.04 --> 10246.0
ideal because a lion is a archetypal

10240.2 --> 10250.880000000001
universal symbol for a noble ruler

10246.0 --> 10252.319
and the Sheep is a universal symbol for

10250.88 --> 10255.199999999999
a

10252.319 --> 10260.76
subservient

10255.2 --> 10264.2
beond so it's the perfect Alchemy in the

10260.76 --> 10267.399
symbol of lion and the lamb that's

10264.2 --> 10272.08
completely separate from any biblical

10267.399 --> 10275.519999999999
interpretation it's an es esoteric

10272.08 --> 10278.68
icon not a historic

10275.52 --> 10283.319000000001
reflection that's why it works way

10278.68 --> 10283.319
better than a wolf and a

10283.64 --> 10291.08
lamb because that's still relevant it's

10287.12 --> 10294.6
just not the perfect completely all

10291.08 --> 10297.16
encompassing archetypal image that is

10294.6 --> 10298.800000000001
aesthetically perfect line in Lamb

10297.16 --> 10303.56
aesthetically

10298.8 --> 10308.119999999999
perfect that's how you want to remember

10303.56 --> 10308.119999999999
it it's not from the Bible

10323.76 --> 10328.800000000001
though wolves in the Middle East would

10326.04 --> 10330.76
be interesting yeah there were no wolves

10328.8 --> 10333.96
the Bible wasn't in the freaking Middle

10330.76 --> 10336.04
East it was in southern France gzilla it

10333.96 --> 10339.519999999999
always was in southern

10336.04 --> 10342.479000000001
France everybody just didn't see it they

10339.52 --> 10342.479000000001
didn't want to see

10345.16 --> 10348.96
it names have been

10349.12 --> 10357.2
changed names of locations and

10353.76 --> 10357.2
individuals have been

10357.56 --> 10360.56
altered

10361.76 --> 10367.0
yeah I

10363.439 --> 10369.6
mean you think that Lions would even be

10367.0 --> 10371.8
there in supposed Middle

10369.6 --> 10374.479000000001
East what the hell's a lion going to be

10371.8 --> 10377.759999999998
doing there in the desert

10374.479 --> 10380.599999999999
nothing there weren't any Lions

10377.76 --> 10383.76
there this all nonsense there's no

10380.6 --> 10386.6
wolves there there's no Lions

10383.76 --> 10391.439
there yeah they're not

10386.6 --> 10393.76
there they might be in southern

10391.439 --> 10397.56
France although a lion is going to be

10393.76 --> 10401.399
tough to find but wolves definitely yeah

10397.56 --> 10405.119999999999
lions come from

10401.399 --> 10408.119999999999
Africa not the Middle

10405.12 --> 10408.12
East

10423.359 --> 10426.359
yeah

10432.52 --> 10437.880000000001
all the old paintings of Jesus The Lion

10435.68 --> 10442.12
and the lamb yeah it's a bunch of ult

10437.88 --> 10445.88
[ __ ] CU it relates to something

10442.12 --> 10445.880000000001
else not to the

10446.0 --> 10450.76
Bible yeah a lot of these painters

10449.239 --> 10453.279
even

10450.76 --> 10456.16
like it's

10453.279 --> 10458.319000000001
different

10456.16 --> 10462.119999999999
they're doing occult

10458.319 --> 10467.278999999999
stuff the paintings aren't actually

10462.12 --> 10467.279
referencing the Bible they're

10472.72 --> 10479.88
occultists yeah and what do occultists

10477.8 --> 10483.278999999999
do they

10479.88 --> 10486.0
hide information in plain

10483.279 --> 10488.880000000001
sight

10486.0 --> 10488.88
and that's what they

10501.399 --> 10507.0
did yeah I know clamy I've heard of

10504.479 --> 10509.88
that Electronics contain a lot of

10507.0 --> 10509.88
recyclable

10513.2 --> 10516.2
metals

10518.96 --> 10523.119999999999
Skip by those that don't fit

10543.2 --> 10547.960000000001
what

10546.16 --> 10551.88
okay goodz I don't know exactly what the

10547.96 --> 10554.88
point is are you trying to argue for an

10551.88 --> 10556.239
actual physical reality altered Mandela

10554.88 --> 10558.88
effect are

10556.239 --> 10560.96
you you think that that's more likely

10558.88 --> 10564.88
than that there's a

10560.96 --> 10568.438999999998
cultists that play on people's aesthetic

10564.88 --> 10572.199999999999
sense and ignorance about their own

10568.439 --> 10574.720000000001
psychologies to hide occult information

10572.2 --> 10577.359
in plain sight

10574.72 --> 10579.72
I think that occultist hiding

10577.359 --> 10585.6
information in plain side is a lot more

10579.72 --> 10585.599999999999
likely than entirety of reality shifting

10600.239 --> 10605.52
physically

10602.2 --> 10608.2
wow yeah that's quite that's impressive

10605.52 --> 10611.52
clamy sure they

10608.2 --> 10613.960000000001
are do they use chemicals to extract the

10611.52 --> 10613.960000000001
gold

10615.6 --> 10618.6
yeah

10619.52 --> 10625.720000000001
absolutely they use like King's water

10623.439 --> 10631.0
sulfuric acid

10625.72 --> 10633.0
and uh and what the other

10631.0 --> 10637.6
one King's

10633.0 --> 10637.6
water that's what they dissolve the gold

10658.12 --> 10662.6
in let me see if I can find the

10663.0 --> 10666.0
proper

10668.92 --> 10675.359
yeah

10670.6 --> 10675.359
Aquaria that's what this called King's

10680.439 --> 10687.0
water nitr hydrochloric acid Royal

10688.56 --> 10692.92
water but that it is specifically to

10691.72 --> 10695.92
dissolve

10692.92 --> 10695.92
gold

10713.68 --> 10718.6
right and it's so

10714.92 --> 10721.04
useful because it specifically dissolves

10718.6 --> 10724.12
like Noble Metals like gold and platinum

10721.04 --> 10725.359
so that's why they used it it's really

10724.12 --> 10729.479000000001
for like

10725.359 --> 10732.880000000001
purification ends that they use it not

10729.479 --> 10735.64
for the raw extraction it's like first

10732.88 --> 10738.199999999999
just get everything metal in a bucket

10735.64 --> 10740.439
then you throw the [ __ ] in and then you

10738.2 --> 10743.439
take the liquid out and then

10740.439 --> 10745.359
you UND disolve it you make you

10743.439 --> 10751.04
chemically transform

10745.359 --> 10751.04
it and then get the pure gold out of the

10752.84 --> 10755.84
extract

10762.8 --> 10765.358999999999
get more

10768.2 --> 10774.439
rare yeah R well it's not even that

10771.2 --> 10776.720000000001
weird when you think it's super gross

10774.439 --> 10779.359
but yeah there's plenty of really

10776.72 --> 10781.319
dumbass [ __ ] this says I'm going to

10779.359 --> 10783.12
blame women that typically would do that

10781.319 --> 10784.519999999999
men wouldn't do that that would like

10783.12 --> 10786.720000000001
throw their

10784.52 --> 10788.84
their wedding ring or their engagement

10786.72 --> 10792.92
rings in the toilet because they're

10788.84 --> 10792.92
pissed off so

10795.0 --> 10799.88
yeah

10797.319 --> 10803.359
statistically you will be able to find

10799.88 --> 10807.8
some jewelry at the end of

10803.359 --> 10810.2
large like sewage systems in a city

10807.8 --> 10812.759999999998
there will be jewelry statistically

10810.2 --> 10815.12
coming through that

10812.76 --> 10817.359
periodically weird right when you think

10815.12 --> 10817.359
about

10832.52 --> 10836.84
it it's cool that I know how to do all

10834.96 --> 10839.64
the gold stuff yeah well that's part of

10836.84 --> 10842.359
the the benefit of having done

10839.64 --> 10845.76
goldsmithing studies I know some

10842.359 --> 10849.479000000001
metalogy and all that really

10845.76 --> 10852.68
useful and more importantly I know where

10849.479 --> 10854.599999999999
to look for more detail now I know what

10852.68 --> 10857.84
directions to look in I don't have any

10854.6 --> 10860.439
weird mystical misconceptions because I

10857.84 --> 10863.92
I've actually looked into

10860.439 --> 10866.6
it and I had good relatively good

10863.92 --> 10871.92
sources in form of books that I still

10866.6 --> 10871.92
have just not here it's in

10872.64 --> 10875.64
storage

10880.6 --> 10884.960000000001
and each with character Thunderbolt said

10883.319 --> 10887.359
wolf and

10884.96 --> 10890.599999999999
lamb huh he

10887.359 --> 10890.6
did that's

10902.64 --> 10907.76
interesting

10904.6 --> 10907.76
medicines in

10908.6 --> 10914.359
seage that's

10911.2 --> 10918.16
crazy but yeah really I'm not going to

10914.359 --> 10918.16
do that though

10921.12 --> 10926.04
let's I mean eventually look when

10923.76 --> 10928.08
there's like real transformative

10926.04 --> 10931.800000000001
transmutate

10928.08 --> 10931.8
transm transmutator

10932.279 --> 10937.720000000001
technology then eventually like the

10934.68 --> 10942.64
seage could just go through this like

10937.72 --> 10942.64
electric gate that will just

10942.68 --> 10948.6
like like electrocute basically the

10946.0 --> 10950.04
sewage and just extract everything out

10948.6 --> 10952.68
of it

10950.04 --> 10955.720000000001
somehow like get all the metals out get

10952.68 --> 10958.720000000001
all all the components all of it just

10955.72 --> 10958.72
separated

10959.6 --> 10964.439
extracted like a massive

10962.56 --> 10967.278999999999
transmutation

10964.439 --> 10970.2
where basically just crap and sewage can

10967.279 --> 10973.560000000001
all be separated into

10970.2 --> 10976.68
like specific type of

10973.56 --> 10980.479
materials that in its separated form can

10976.68 --> 10980.479000000001
then be like more easily

10982.56 --> 10988.278999999999
recycled or

10985.52 --> 10990.960000000001
neutralized I don't know it's like an

10988.279 --> 10993.640000000001
idea I had even in the dark world like

10990.96 --> 10995.679999999998
perfect recycling is what I did call it

10993.64 --> 10999.199999999999
this is like a perfect recycling that

10995.68 --> 11003.0
everything that goes in can like be

10999.2 --> 11003.0
retransformed into like raw

11003.08 --> 11008.88
materials that

11006.2 --> 11012.6
idea I mean it would literally

11008.88 --> 11014.8
disintegrate material over time though

11012.6 --> 11016.960000000001
that would be a little bit lost for

11014.8 --> 11020.16
every time you do it but I mean you're

11016.96 --> 11020.16
going to be doing it

11021.319 --> 11025.479
on what

11026.68 --> 11030.64
sub more B what

11030.92 --> 11034.88
okay get you back on

11037.439 --> 11042.56
F

what channel is dead what the [ __ ] are

11042.56 --> 11046.88
you whining about you [ __ ]

11044.439 --> 11049.2
wanker channel is not dead at all it's

11046.88 --> 11049.199999999999
doing

11050.64 --> 11055.358999999999
great I'm doing great my channel is

11053.08 --> 11060.08
great I'm having a great

11055.359 --> 11064.279
conversation I have more elaborate

11060.08 --> 11068.399
subjects continually

11064.279 --> 11071.319000000001
now I've had like a thre hour

11068.399 --> 11073.96
show every day pretty

11071.319 --> 11076.479
much what the hell are you whining about

11073.96 --> 11080.278999999999
this channel is dead

11076.479 --> 11080.278999999999
[ __ ] Channel's doing

11082.359 --> 11088.76
great

11084.04 --> 11088.76
God's messages are still visible so

11091.88 --> 11098.319
what why wouldn't G's messages be

11095.319 --> 11098.319
visible

11101.68 --> 11109.399
G hey blue evolution by the

11105.279 --> 11109.399000000001
way confusion comes from

11109.8 --> 11115.278999999999
Tomy saying Luke I am your father

11116.359 --> 11121.720000000001
oh that's

11117.399 --> 11125.64
funny but I mean that somebody did

11121.72 --> 11129.599999999999
that is only logical everybody back then

11125.64 --> 11132.68
blue Evolution would have said luk I am

11129.6 --> 11135.92
your father like it's not because one

11132.68 --> 11138.56
person said it at the time in some media

11135.92 --> 11140.8
thing they would all think it because

11138.56 --> 11143.88
it's the natural thing that

11140.8 --> 11147.119999999999
automatically pops up in your head head

11143.88 --> 11150.599999999999
in response to how it was that's what

11147.12 --> 11153.239000000001
makes it a Mandela effect because the

11150.6 --> 11156.84
effect is universal everybody will have

11153.239 --> 11161.88
the same exact response everybody will

11156.84 --> 11165.68
think the exact same false thing about

11161.88 --> 11168.399
it it's the persistence yeah a Mandela

11165.68 --> 11170.439
effect isn't like unique per individual

11168.399 --> 11172.8
like oh my aesthetic mind thinks that

11170.439 --> 11175.399
this form is the best way and that other

11172.8 --> 11176.84
person no they thought oh it was even

11175.399 --> 11180.72
slightly different in the other

11176.84 --> 11185.439
direction like no no all the aesthetic

11180.72 --> 11188.8
Minds all think the same thing in

11185.439 --> 11191.08
response and so then everybody agrees

11188.8 --> 11195.119999999999
it's different from reality because

11191.08 --> 11196.12
everybody's aesthetic mind all think the

11195.12 --> 11199.439
same

11196.12 --> 11201.960000000001
thing that's what makes it so

11199.439 --> 11206.56
bizarre is that the athetic minds of

11201.96 --> 11206.56
every person responds the same

11213.92 --> 11220.12
way what entering duper

11217.12 --> 11220.12
oh

11225.76 --> 11230.64
okay what did the Earth is like a

11228.0 --> 11232.84
rectangle with two ice walls on both

11230.64 --> 11234.92
sides well I don't know about an ice

11232.84 --> 11238.72
wall at the North

11234.92 --> 11241.88
side but yeah that's our rectangular

11238.72 --> 11244.599999999999
looping system

11241.88 --> 11246.64
is yeah

11244.6 --> 11249.479000000001
Antarctica is like

11246.64 --> 11252.88
a like a wall but it's straight it's not

11249.479 --> 11256.278999999999
a circle that surrounds us it's not an

11252.88 --> 11259.96
island which is surrounded by us it's

11256.279 --> 11264.6
just like no it's just yeah a wall that

11259.96 --> 11266.358999999999
blocks with ice everything south of that

11264.6 --> 11270.399000000001
I don't know if that's in the north as

11266.359 --> 11274.279
well I don't know I mean there's ice

11270.399 --> 11277.68
there but not an ice wall as far as I

11274.279 --> 11280.720000000001
know there's just some winter ice that

11277.68 --> 11284.6
floats there and then it melts a bit

11280.72 --> 11284.599999999999
during the summer that's

11288.96 --> 11295.039999999999
it hey Ste traveler yeah I'm still going

11292.2 --> 11295.04
that's right

11295.319 --> 11299.278999999999
why you rectangle R than a square

11299.479 --> 11306.358999999999
because that's the the known terrain is

11302.84 --> 11309.359
like it seems to be a

11306.359 --> 11312.52
rectangle east to west is a longer

11309.359 --> 11312.52
distance than north to

11316.96 --> 11325.0
south that's why it's a

11320.16 --> 11325.0
rectangle and not a square

11332.56 --> 11336.76
right but I am going to run out now I

11334.439 --> 11338.720000000001
