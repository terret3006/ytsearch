cloudy and then had a little bit of

139.959 --> 148.84
sun there's some blue spots here and

145.12 --> 151.20000000000002
there not right now

148.84 --> 155.0
though

151.2 --> 157.48
all right it's dried up again yesterday

155.0 --> 160.92
was very rainy and

157.48 --> 165.92
dreary yesterday overall was just I

160.92 --> 165.92
don't know man terrible day for

171.4 --> 177.239
me but uh not a strong feeling today is

174.76 --> 177.239
going to be

178.84 --> 182.44
better all

191.12 --> 197.36
right it's Tuesday the 12th of March

197.59 --> 200.93
[Music]

201.2 --> 205.56
20124 temperature is 9°

208.48 --> 212.72
CSUS 7 24%

214.2 --> 217.2
humidity

238.72 --> 243.68
right

241.64 --> 247.879
yeah I got a

243.68 --> 250.0
title based on like I had a yeah as I

247.879 --> 253.0
said yesterday was overall just not a

250.0 --> 256.0
very pleasant day for

253.0 --> 259.12
me but then yeah I did have Aver couple

256.0 --> 261.0
conversations over Skype with

259.12 --> 267.0
guys and

261.0 --> 267.0
that made me just realize some some

267.56 --> 274.4
stuff cuz I was like wondering like like

270.4 --> 279.56
the visions and [ __ ] and the nightmares

274.4 --> 282.479
like in a way I would part of like

279.56 --> 287.52
deciding that or seemingly so at the

282.479 --> 287.52
beginning of that whole gigantic

288.039 --> 293.24
trip and I was just puzzled like why did

290.72 --> 293.24
I do

294.199 --> 302.759
that but then I remembered like what it

297.199 --> 306.91900000000004
was like like 30 years ago and 25 years

302.759 --> 309.36
ago and then I realized like yeah I'm in

306.919 --> 313.479
ways I'm like different

309.36 --> 316.96000000000004
now because back then like the darkness

313.479 --> 319.15999999999997
and power through evil and all that

316.96 --> 323.44
seemed tempting to

319.16 --> 326.08000000000004
me in ways and it really bothered me

323.44 --> 327.759
back then really

326.08 --> 332.71999999999997
badly

327.759 --> 336.6
but then I realized like yeah that's

332.72 --> 338.16
gone so the conclusion was that I went

336.6 --> 343.68
through all

338.16 --> 345.12
that kind of to like immunize me myself

343.68 --> 349.84000000000003
against the

345.12 --> 352.88
Temptation and that has definitely

349.84 --> 355.63899999999995
worked so that kind of reinvigorated me

352.88 --> 357.199
and just instead of looking back at it

355.639 --> 358.639
like why the hell did I do that to

357.199 --> 362.759
myself I'm just

358.639 --> 366.08
crazy why did I give myself all these

362.759 --> 368.68
nightmares well I basically figured it

366.08 --> 372.039
out in a great

368.68 --> 374.919
realization as I was talking to

372.039 --> 378.71999999999997
clutch over

374.919 --> 382.68
Skype all right anyway hello Ben Johnson

378.72 --> 382.68
first in chat good to see you day and

384.67 --> 387.869
[Music]

388.56 --> 393.479
night

390.4 --> 395.71999999999997
right been having more dreams

393.479 --> 400.599
again seem to be

395.72 --> 404.16
having dreams is now a I guess a nightly

400.599 --> 407.0
thing it's really weird though because I

404.16 --> 410.68
had dreams

407.0 --> 411.68
that I used to have like when I was a

410.68 --> 416.12
little

411.68 --> 418.84000000000003
kid and this these ones are not super

416.12 --> 422.24
Pleasant so it would just like waking up

418.84 --> 423.87899999999996
with that it made me feel again like I

422.24 --> 427.08
was very

423.879 --> 429.72
young in times where I was kind of like

427.08 --> 429.71999999999997
suffering

430.759 --> 436.319
through kind of fear and depression that

433.68 --> 440.0
that would like even at the time

436.319 --> 443.03900000000004
randomly pop out of

440.0 --> 445.24
nowhere so that like yeah I'm just doing

443.039 --> 448.08
whatever and then some days I would wake

445.24 --> 453.84000000000003
up and I would just feel like

448.08 --> 453.84
really sh red shriveled up and

454.8 --> 462.639
like didn't want to do

457.759 --> 465.52000000000004
anything and that's tied to those

462.639 --> 469.919
dreams so it's weird it's weird like

465.52 --> 473.44
getting identical dreams from my past

469.919 --> 473.44
like identical to those hello

475.4 --> 480.919
buckbuster I can describe the dream it's

477.919 --> 483.24
very bizarre it's basically I was

480.919 --> 485.479
sitting in a car with my

483.24 --> 490.40000000000003
mom

485.479 --> 495.24
yeah although in these

490.4 --> 497.08
dreams I wasn't like a little kid that's

495.24 --> 499.159
the big difference when I had those

497.08 --> 502.35999999999996
dreams when I was younger I was like a

499.159 --> 505.479
little kid now I was basically me at

502.36 --> 508.039
this age with my

505.479 --> 510.96
mom but

508.039 --> 514.8
effectively she was was just as old as I

510.96 --> 518.399
am now and that's just really

514.8 --> 521.3199999999999
surreal really really

518.399 --> 522.479
surreal cuz I was noticing it as I was

521.32 --> 525.88
dreaming

522.479 --> 528.6800000000001
it notice like this is familiar like why

525.88 --> 531.76
is this happening again and it's dreams

528.68 --> 536.279
about basically being in a car and

531.76 --> 536.279
driving like very hazardous

537.44 --> 543.9590000000001
roots and hazardous as if in giant

542.04 --> 547.76
Hills and

543.959 --> 550.76
then like going down the hill and then

547.76 --> 553.24
at the end like very very steep hills

550.76 --> 556.64
like crazy

553.24 --> 558.519
like there's no way that roads would

556.64 --> 561.36
ever be constructed like that so I guess

558.519 --> 563.72
it only does happen in dreams like that

561.36 --> 566.24
and the only places where I've had

563.72 --> 570.12
actually seen Hills like that with roads

566.24 --> 573.36
that steep would be like in Spain

570.12 --> 575.48
in certain areas on top of the hill

573.36 --> 579.399
where yeah would

575.48 --> 581.8000000000001
be uh houses there like vacation houses

579.399 --> 584.519
typically and then you'd have to like

581.8 --> 587.76
drive up and down and that's like scary

584.519 --> 589.9590000000001
scary steep but this is like way more

587.76 --> 592.6
exaggerated in the

589.959 --> 597.079
dream if roads like that in Scotland

592.6 --> 600.0
yikes but I mean really steep like

597.079 --> 603.8
45° and such and worse

600.0 --> 607.0
like just like tot like completely nuts

603.8 --> 609.3199999999999
like if you just take a slight turn at

607.0 --> 611.64
the wrong time you immediately fall over

609.32 --> 613.44
and start rolling down like that and

611.64 --> 615.8389999999999
that was that's like the fear in those

613.44 --> 617.72
dreams and my mother would be like no

615.839 --> 621.36
she's used to

617.72 --> 625.0790000000001
it and then drive and like going

621.36 --> 627.399
down like not even like standing on the

625.079 --> 630.5999999999999
brakes to slow down but just like d just

627.399 --> 633.88
letting it go down almost like a

630.6 --> 636.32
roller coaster and then at the end it

633.88 --> 638.32
just like the road just stops and you

636.32 --> 641.72
have to go sideways and then she would

638.32 --> 643.88
just go down and then manage to like

641.72 --> 646.24
take a sharp turn and like without

643.88 --> 647.279
rolling over and but I would be freaking

646.24 --> 650.6
out

647.279 --> 652.519
man so yeah and those dreams I had a lot

650.6 --> 655.9200000000001
of those when I was little and it was

652.519 --> 655.92
real haunting to me

656.0 --> 662.079
then and it kind of was like that very

659.6 --> 664.6800000000001
strange very strange to like relive

662.079 --> 668.279
those specific dreams like

664.68 --> 671.279
that I'm really kind of mystified by

668.279 --> 671.279
it

671.8 --> 677.8489999999999
so like why would I have those dreams

674.7 --> 677.849
[Music]

688.24 --> 691.24
again

693.56 --> 700.6199999999999
it's just so

696.44 --> 702.8800000000001
weird but this part of that dream is

700.62 --> 706.839
[Music]

702.88 --> 706.8389999999999
also it's part of the

707.399 --> 714.36
parallel

709.399 --> 716.88
town except like this part was later

714.36 --> 719.9590000000001
like changed and

716.88 --> 722.32
removed so it's very strange to suddenly

719.959 --> 725.4399999999999
like dream it back in the previous state

722.32 --> 729.7600000000001
like that very strange like I can't

725.44 --> 732.839
explain this I don't know why that

729.76 --> 736.68
is you would be waking up in a sweating

732.839 --> 740.0400000000001
mess well I didn't like wake up right

736.68 --> 743.0
during the Fear Part it's like it's just

740.04 --> 747.12
like and then going then it's like oh my

743.0 --> 749.76
God but then eventually like stabilizing

747.12 --> 752.5600000000001
and and you're just like oh my my God I

749.76 --> 755.92
can't believe that we made that so I

752.56 --> 758.5999999999999
wouldn't like then wake up in a fear

755.92 --> 761.8
like it would basically continue on but

758.6 --> 765.0790000000001
it still like left

761.8 --> 768.24
this this weird feeling when I woke up

765.079 --> 771.3599999999999
it it's not even like

768.24 --> 774.199
fear like it's not a nightmare it's just

771.36 --> 777.399
like this dream that's just like pulling

774.199 --> 779.959
on my feelings or something it's very

777.399 --> 782.639
strange and that's exact what I used to

779.959 --> 785.5999999999999
have I I when I was little I didn't like

782.639 --> 788.6800000000001
have nightmares as much where I would

785.6 --> 791.36
just wake up screaming or anything I had

788.68 --> 795.16
that a couple of times but that was like

791.36 --> 797.6
always related to actual demonic

795.16 --> 800.4399999999999
monsters

797.6 --> 803.839
like like monsters that were demonic

800.44 --> 805.36
that like seemed like alien from the

803.839 --> 808.519
movie franchise

805.36 --> 811.24
alien but not exactly like that but very

808.519 --> 814.8
similar like very dark Shady scaly

811.24 --> 816.8
things slightly different very scary

814.8 --> 820.56
those were like real terror nightmares

816.8 --> 820.56
and I only had those like a few

821.72 --> 829.9590000000001
times and then after that some point in

824.839 --> 833.5600000000001
my preens that just stopped thank

829.959 --> 836.92
God cuz

833.56 --> 839.959
yeah I think I later like even got back

836.92 --> 842.36
to those and then through realization

839.959 --> 843.8
that it was a dream I would basically be

842.36 --> 846.639
able

843.8 --> 848.7589999999999
to like face off against them and then

846.639 --> 851.72
they never came

848.759 --> 854.1990000000001
back right but this is not this is like

851.72 --> 856.0400000000001
another environment type dream traveling

854.199 --> 858.519
through an environment I've had a lot of

856.04 --> 859.88
Dreams over my life where I'm traveling

858.519 --> 864.24
through an

859.88 --> 868.04
environment that's specific and

864.24 --> 871.759
surreal I've also had dreams even much

868.04 --> 875.399
later that I've had even like eight

871.759 --> 877.639
years ago and all that where it's like

875.399 --> 880.279
we're traveling a long

877.639 --> 882.88
distance and then it's like on a road

880.279 --> 884.759
everything's flat but then suddenly like

882.88 --> 889.04
yeah there's this thing that's on this

884.759 --> 891.92
in like the road just for no damn reason

889.04 --> 894.759
just goes up like really steep really

891.92 --> 897.16
high so you're like towering above

894.759 --> 898.839
you're like looking down on everything

897.16 --> 900.079
it's like there's no damn reason for

898.839 --> 902.399
that to be

900.079 --> 903.5999999999999
there and there was like some stuff

902.399 --> 905.88
built that you're going through some

903.6 --> 908.0790000000001
kind of tunnel up there it's really

905.88 --> 910.88
weird like you're going through a tunnel

908.079 --> 913.8
but the tunnel isn't like underneath a

910.88 --> 917.04
bridge like typically in the roads but

913.8 --> 919.12
like going up Super Steep and then going

917.04 --> 922.24
through a tunnel that's very high like

919.12 --> 925.04
makes no damn sense really

922.24 --> 926.44
weird I haven't had those dreams for a

925.04 --> 930.959
while

926.44 --> 930.9590000000001
though but this one was like very

936.6 --> 942.0790000000001
familiar being stuck between infinite

939.079 --> 942.079
doors

942.44 --> 947.1990000000001
yeah hello Bill n science Den good to

945.12 --> 950.8
see

947.199 --> 950.8
you hold on let

957.04 --> 960.92
me sh this thing

965.12 --> 968.279
no all

968.56 --> 975.4399999999999
right click click click click

972.72 --> 979.279
click

975.44 --> 982.0
and let's have some peace and

979.279 --> 987.199
quiet that game really

982.0 --> 990.92
does eat up my processor a lot all right

987.199 --> 990.92
so full Focus

992.279 --> 996.48
right so yeah I felt kind of eerie this

996.519 --> 1003.199
morning been up for a while like like

1000.72 --> 1003.1990000000001
before

1003.6 --> 1011.1990000000001
12 and like it just didn't feel

1007.319 --> 1014.7199999999999
fantastic I mean yesterday was way worse

1011.199 --> 1017.88
but today like like then I had like a

1014.72 --> 1020.1600000000001
little bit of chocolate and that really

1017.88 --> 1022.88
helped and like it was weird because

1020.16 --> 1024.48
when I ate that I got like this

1022.88 --> 1026.559
chocolate brownie that's been in the

1024.48 --> 1027.839
fridge for like a week already I kind of

1026.559 --> 1031.439
left

1027.839 --> 1035.6399999999999
it took like one bite out of

1031.439 --> 1038.64
it and that like really like just erased

1035.64 --> 1041.5200000000002
the bad mood in ways so I I felt a lot

1038.64 --> 1043.5590000000002
better after that and even like it's so

1041.52 --> 1046.679
weird how that synchronized like took

1043.559 --> 1050.559
the bite got back felt better like oh

1046.679 --> 1053.3600000000001
and then the Sun comes out like

1050.559 --> 1057.0
what

1053.36 --> 1058.7199999999998
what that just baffles me sometimes how

1057.0 --> 1060.799
these things

1058.72 --> 1064.16
synchronize it's like the outside

1060.799 --> 1068.9189999999999
weather just becomes a symbol of my

1064.16 --> 1068.919
feeling experiences somehow very

1072.0 --> 1077.84
strange all right anyway yeah good to

1074.64 --> 1080.8400000000001
see so many people in the

1077.84 --> 1080.84
chat

1081.679 --> 1090.039
Yeah by all means share your own dreams

1085.44 --> 1094.44
of to talk about it I'm I guys I haven't

1090.039 --> 1098.039
had this many intense dreams on a daily

1094.44 --> 1102.24
basis since I was a little

1098.039 --> 1104.679
kid cuz logically like in my teens

1102.24 --> 1106.36
started smoking cannabis it's known to

1104.679 --> 1109.0800000000002
like suppress stream I would still have

1106.36 --> 1111.9189999999999
dreams but when I was a kid I had like a

1109.08 --> 1114.559
lot of dreams and those dreams would be

1111.919 --> 1117.88
very impressive and I would like dwell I

1114.559 --> 1120.6
would be distracted even during school

1117.88 --> 1123.4
by just thinking about those

1120.6 --> 1126.1999999999998
dreams and then during my teens that

1123.4 --> 1129.0
kind of stopped and I stuck more to like

1126.2 --> 1129.0
the the waking

1130.32 --> 1135.12
world right but I've had many

1133.44 --> 1137.4
interesting dreams some of which I have

1135.12 --> 1139.9599999999998
also shared with you guys

1137.4 --> 1141.2800000000002
already w back it's not the first time

1139.96 --> 1144.52
I'm talking about

1141.28 --> 1147.1589999999999
dreams debatable

1144.52 --> 1149.12
D hopefully was done yeah it's called

1147.159 --> 1152.88
bad move oh what you want to you want me

1149.12 --> 1155.6
to go or something debatable D cuz I'm

1152.88 --> 1155.6000000000001
not I'm right

1158.559 --> 1163.72
here and it's not about changing my mind

1161.159 --> 1166.3200000000002
it's about changing my feelings

1163.72 --> 1168.72
yesterday was just a terrible day for me

1166.32 --> 1171.08
and probably not only me like everybody

1168.72 --> 1174.08
seem to be in a really shitty

1171.08 --> 1174.08
mood

1174.919 --> 1178.4
unexpectedly today's

1178.919 --> 1187.0
better who's that did do

1183.48 --> 1187.0
music who are

1190.08 --> 1196.76
you why is Google being

1192.799 --> 1199.28
silly could you elaborate on that it's

1196.76 --> 1202.08
vague statements is not really really

1199.28 --> 1202.08
giving me any

1203.96 --> 1209.08
clues yeah but yeah bu out bu it's not

1207.0 --> 1212.12
the first time I mean hey if things

1209.08 --> 1214.24
would have gotten worse then yeah I was

1212.12 --> 1217.1999999999998
actually seriously considering just

1214.24 --> 1218.679
stopping and people been recommending it

1217.2 --> 1220.8400000000001
to me even

1218.679 --> 1223.8400000000001
friends

1220.84 --> 1223.84
because

1225.12 --> 1233.32
yeah it's just not feeling good

1230.44 --> 1235.28
but today it's better and so I'm just

1233.32 --> 1238.3999999999999
bringing the better to the table and

1235.28 --> 1240.6399999999999
just do what I can do and have a show

1238.4 --> 1240.64
and

1244.76 --> 1249.44
talk connecting up I've been connecting

1247.28 --> 1252.1589999999999
up with a lot of people on Skype and I

1249.44 --> 1254.96
love to do that

1252.159 --> 1257.24
more Google asked you if you were a

1254.96 --> 1259.3600000000001
robot

1257.24 --> 1262.36
what what do you you

1259.36 --> 1262.36
mean

1269.72 --> 1276.279
where right but

1272.799 --> 1281.96
look the reason I would go would

1276.279 --> 1286.48
be because I just felt very demoralized

1281.96 --> 1286.48
when logging in oh okay

1287.52 --> 1291.44
huh

1290.48 --> 1295.279
like

1291.44 --> 1298.76
earlier like the years that preceded

1295.279 --> 1301.12
this I would consider like quitting

1298.76 --> 1306.919
because of the financial

1301.12 --> 1306.9189999999999
situation well that has kind of changed

1307.44 --> 1315.44
so I can basically keep doing this

1313.4 --> 1318.88
just just need

1315.44 --> 1321.88
to keep going and figure out how to to

1318.88 --> 1324.44
fill it up and and make the shows

1321.88 --> 1324.44
interesting

1325.4 --> 1330.52
enough if you were a robot you wouldn't

1327.76 --> 1330.52
ADM I bet you

1343.84 --> 1347.36
wouldn't right anyhow I do feel better

1346.36 --> 1350.6399999999999
today

1347.36 --> 1353.6399999999999
and yeah just wanted to share

1350.64 --> 1356.3200000000002
this lots of dreams I might be reporting

1353.64 --> 1358.72
out on dreams for a while cuz I'm sure

1356.32 --> 1361.279
this is not going to be the last one

1358.72 --> 1365.3600000000001
it's just weird that I'm like reliving

1361.279 --> 1367.84
these very very old dreams like that's

1365.36 --> 1371.84
never happened before in my

1367.84 --> 1375.279
life it's always new dreams that ride on

1371.84 --> 1379.9189999999999
on the same theme but I've never like

1375.279 --> 1383.559
relived dreams that I dreamed like

1379.919 --> 1388.3600000000001
30 years ago and 35 years ago that's

1383.559 --> 1393.039
very strange it's almost a bit unnerving

1388.36 --> 1393.039
like I don't know why I've never had

1397.32 --> 1403.039
that but at the same time like I am

1400.52 --> 1405.76
going through some weird Transformations

1403.039 --> 1408.12
spiritually like pretty

1405.76 --> 1410.679
significant and yeah everybody has

1408.12 --> 1413.12
period where they like things happen

1410.679 --> 1415.8400000000001
round out ups and downs and then like oh

1413.12 --> 1418.0
I feel different and like oh I'm

1415.84 --> 1421.4399999999998
interested in different things

1418.0 --> 1424.32
but that's happened but it's not just

1421.44 --> 1424.3200000000002
that it's like

1424.64 --> 1429.24
physiologically I seem to have changed

1427.559 --> 1430.799
like I've been continuing reading in a

1429.24 --> 1434.72
rud of siner

1430.799 --> 1434.72
book I've gone through

1434.76 --> 1443.679
like five P 10 pages

1439.6 --> 1447.1999999999998
I've never even read that much in one

1443.679 --> 1450.5590000000002
go and I'm like I'm reallying as really

1447.2 --> 1452.559
assimilating it i' like I've become like

1450.559 --> 1457.279
good at reading all of a sudden like

1452.559 --> 1459.72
that's never ever happened like even

1457.279 --> 1461.24
when I was reading through the entire

1459.72 --> 1464.559
Lord of the

1461.24 --> 1466.559
Rings I had trouble doing that it took

1464.559 --> 1469.44
me like a summer

1466.559 --> 1471.76
vacation but I really wanted to I was

1469.44 --> 1474.44
really like into the story that was

1471.76 --> 1474.44
around when I

1474.86 --> 1479.4399999999998
[Music]

1476.559 --> 1482.44
was 17 I

1479.44 --> 1484.72
think it's like the only big book that I

1482.44 --> 1486.3990000000001
actually read on a voluntary basis and

1484.72 --> 1490.08
not for school because I've never been a

1486.399 --> 1495.039
book reader again because when I read

1490.08 --> 1498.12
usually after a page I find myself just

1495.039 --> 1500.96
like letting my eyes go past the text

1498.12 --> 1502.6399999999999
but then actually not reading it but

1500.96 --> 1505.2
thinking about other things and that's

1502.64 --> 1508.96
like very much a hassle because you keep

1505.2 --> 1511.0
losing track if like like what did I

1508.96 --> 1513.76
miss I like I've been reading something

1511.0 --> 1513.76
but it's not this

1514.76 --> 1521.64
book

1516.72 --> 1524.279
well that isn't happening now I've never

1521.64 --> 1524.279
experienced

1525.52 --> 1536.1589999999999
that so in ways I I feel like I have to

1532.08 --> 1538.96
like re-explore my

1536.159 --> 1541.5590000000002
senses I feel like I'm like a different

1538.96 --> 1541.559
person in

1544.679 --> 1552.2
ways and maybe it's for the best because

1547.64 --> 1557.6000000000001
I mean I've openly shared right

1552.2 --> 1559.799
that like in cognitively I'm very sharp

1557.6 --> 1560.84
like even under anxiety I can remain

1559.799 --> 1564.1589999999999
very

1560.84 --> 1566.76
sharp but emotionally I've had issues

1564.159 --> 1569.1200000000001
and that's been my entire

1566.76 --> 1573.32
life but it seems like there's been

1569.12 --> 1576.08
changes in in that part as well and

1573.32 --> 1579.8799999999999
maybe that's why I'm like

1576.08 --> 1582.12
reliving very old things it's never

1579.88 --> 1585.159
happened before so maybe there's this

1582.12 --> 1587.2399999999998
thing that's now healed or something

1585.159 --> 1590.24
after a

1587.24 --> 1590.24
lifetime

1600.2 --> 1605.8400000000001
it's it's pretty mysterious to me

1603.36 --> 1609.0
anyway are planning to make changes to

1605.84 --> 1609.0
the show no not

1615.76 --> 1622.399
really ER of fire says he's locked

1619.399 --> 1622.399
out

1623.52 --> 1627.08
okay what's going

1636.08 --> 1641.8799999999999
on

1638.88 --> 1641.88
is

1643.96 --> 1650.159
uhoh right let me

1647.159 --> 1650.159
check

1677.12 --> 1680.12
for

1697.38 --> 1700.999
[Music]

1707.12 --> 1711.6399999999999
for

1709.84 --> 1716.32
lock I don't know what's going on but

1711.64 --> 1716.3200000000002
he's not in the block list or anything

1737.039 --> 1740.919
so

1738.84 --> 1744.6399999999999
could be that I gave him a timeout like

1740.919 --> 1747.48
24 hours or something maybe not sure I

1744.64 --> 1749.6000000000001
did though yesterday but I got really

1747.48 --> 1753.44
kind of pissed off at the end with all

1749.6 --> 1753.4399999999998
the [ __ ] trolls of continually

1753.679 --> 1760.24
whining so I don't know maybe I maybe I

1757.2 --> 1762.559
did I don't know what it is but he's not

1760.24 --> 1765.84
in the block

1762.559 --> 1770.1589999999999
list so the longest he could have been

1765.84 --> 1773.799
timed out is 24 hours you should try

1770.159 --> 1776.7990000000002
again like after an hour or so hey

1773.799 --> 1776.799
clutch good to see you

1777.24 --> 1781.64
man what what the

1781.679 --> 1785.1200000000001
hell what is

1789.679 --> 1794.799
that oh

1791.799 --> 1794.799
replay

1795.799 --> 1801.6399999999999
huh oh and Benjamin just went live but

1799.2 --> 1804.76
it's a replay probably of last night's

1801.64 --> 1808.88
stream I was watching that before the

1804.76 --> 1808.8799999999999
show it's interesting got

1809.559 --> 1812.559
halfway

1820.32 --> 1826.039
huh yeah I think that's that's what it

1823.399 --> 1826.039
is all

1826.96 --> 1829.96
right

1853.84 --> 1858.76
huh okay day and night why change your L

1857.559 --> 1860.6789999999999
formula

1858.76 --> 1863.2
thank you for

1860.679 --> 1864.88

guys now that you're all

1867.2 --> 1870.679
here appreciate

1873.6 --> 1878.4399999999998
it 33 watching that's

1880.79 --> 1883.97
[Music]

1884.12 --> 1891.2399999999998
good yeah slowmo still not R I don't

1886.919 --> 1893.3200000000002
know yeah the B of I hope he's all right

1891.24 --> 1895.6
but I did remember that he was going to

1893.32 --> 1898.24
go in the hospital for an operation or

1895.6 --> 1901.1999999999998
something so I hope everything went all

1898.24 --> 1902.6
right it might be like just recovering

1901.2 --> 1905.6000000000001
or

1902.6 --> 1905.6
something

1916.84 --> 1921.559
like

1918.36 --> 1925.039
and ilis no ilis is

1921.559 --> 1928.1589999999999
there he was there

1925.039 --> 1930.6
yesterday clocks changed in the USA yes

1928.159 --> 1930.6000000000001
yes they

1933.679 --> 1938.279
did yeah was talking about music

1936.12 --> 1943.039
recently and I had a Skype call with him

1938.279 --> 1946.639
two days ago so he's definitely

1943.039 --> 1948.8799999999999
there what I mean Isis is kind of

1946.639 --> 1952.24
busy like

1948.88 --> 1957.1200000000001
he's got this job and he has to like

1952.24 --> 1960.48
travel and it's yeah very intense so he

1957.12 --> 1960.4799999999998
doesn't have that much time

1962.559 --> 1966.279
overall except for in the

1967.32 --> 1972.84
weekends right but yeah no everything is

1973.23 --> 1979.84
[Music]

1976.84 --> 1979.84
fine

1983.159 --> 1988.5590000000002
also talked to original D Rose yesterday

1985.84 --> 1990.799
over Skype really good to hear that he's

1988.559 --> 1990.799
all

1991.6 --> 1996.799
right there's a chance that somewhere

1994.679 --> 1999.8400000000001
maybe in the near future he might even

1996.799 --> 2003.44
like get on for a

1999.84 --> 2003.4399999999998
bit call in

2006.76 --> 2009.76
again

2022.44 --> 2025.24
was it

2023.44 --> 2028.3200000000002
Forward

2025.24 --> 2030.44
yes and I'm pretty sure that here in

2028.32 --> 2033.2
Europe we're going to catch up next

2030.44 --> 2033.2
Sunday

2035.2 --> 2040.0800000000002
too does that mean it's going to be

2037.24 --> 2040.08
earlier for

2043.799 --> 2049.799
me for the US does it seem like I'm

2046.559 --> 2049.799
starting late for you

2058.2 --> 2062.6389999999997
guys right anyway for me that would be

2060.679 --> 2064.96
like perfectly fine because I've been

2062.639 --> 2067.2400000000002
like getting up way

2064.96 --> 2068.33
earlier so that would just work out

2095.679 --> 2101.599
days like maybe he just kind of stopped

2098.92 --> 2103.7200000000003
maybe he felt he needed to focus on his

2101.599 --> 2107.839
new secret job or

2103.72 --> 2107.839
whatever I don't know what the hell he's

confusing

2302.52 --> 2307.7599999999998
anyway I've been think like I don't know

2305.28 --> 2310.8390000000004
if you guys really feel like it but

2307.76 --> 2314.28
there's like a lot of stuff going on out

2310.839 --> 2314.2799999999997
there in the

2316.2 --> 2322.04
world and I do like want to like talk

2319.68 --> 2323.7999999999997
about it a bit I just don't really feel

2322.04 --> 2327.319
like I'm getting a lot

2323.8 --> 2329.92
of motivation from you guys to bring

2327.319 --> 2329.92
such things

2332.44 --> 2338.079
up think for example by now that most of

2335.839 --> 2340.2
you have probably taken note of like

2338.079 --> 2344.28
this

2340.2 --> 2345.7599999999998
crazy aan cannibalism [ __ ] going down

2344.28 --> 2350.0400000000004
and I'm definitely not going to play

2345.76 --> 2350.0400000000004
those videos but like what the hell

2353.96 --> 2358.4
man thereare I say I did call it a

2358.68 --> 2365.7599999999998
bit like my rage wi predictions I did

2363.28 --> 2367.96
tell like it's going to be just literal

2365.76 --> 2369.2400000000002
hell on the streets

2367.96 --> 2372.839
never thought it was going to be like

2369.24 --> 2372.839
eating humans or anything

2373.44 --> 2381.04
but I thought in other directions but I

2377.119 --> 2381.04
mean I did kind of call

2383.72 --> 2387.48
it apparently there's

2388.079 --> 2395.48
new a new Chinese spy balloon discovered

2392.64 --> 2395.48
off the coast of

2396.319 --> 2399.319
Alaska

2400.2 --> 2402.839
that's just

2405.72 --> 2409.52
in like just

2411.599 --> 2418.48
now and it's like a

2414.56 --> 2418.48
saton it's a really cool

2421.28 --> 2428.8390000000004
picture let me share

2424.359 --> 2433.44
that just a photograph check this out

2428.839 --> 2433.44
I mean that a sad aloon or

2445.44 --> 2451.64
what play the I because I don't play

2448.64 --> 2454.48
videos boxb haven't you taken notice of

2451.64 --> 2455.5989999999997
that I don't actually play videos I

2454.48 --> 2458.4
share

2455.599 --> 2460.92
links I don't play videos I don't I

2458.4 --> 2460.92
don't do

2462.92 --> 2467.839
that

2465.04 --> 2470.44
like especially if I haven't actually

2467.839 --> 2470.44
watched them

2471.16 --> 2475.68
yet right I mean if there's something

2473.88 --> 2480.52
and I'm like

2475.68 --> 2480.52
hey this is this would be cool to

2486.24 --> 2489.24
share

2503.77 --> 2506.849
[Music]

2514.8 --> 2519.7200000000003
also apparently Boeing is just

2516.8 --> 2524.28
completely falling

2519.72 --> 2524.2799999999997
apart like all their planes are

2525.319 --> 2531.52
like breaking up which is like crazy I

2529.56 --> 2533.56
mean that is like

2531.52 --> 2538.359
genuinely

2533.56 --> 2538.359
bizarre that they've gotten away with

2539.599 --> 2546.7200000000003
it that's also happening out

2542.839 --> 2549.68
there so yeah airplane travel uh it's

2546.72 --> 2549.68
not what used to

2553.16 --> 2558.359
be private Pike died who is

2568.72 --> 2574.48

your

2575.76 --> 2580.1600000000003
binoculars did you see through your

2577.96 --> 2583.44
telescope box out Busters or did you

2580.16 --> 2583.44
just see another

2592.16 --> 2596.48
video it was a Boeing oh yeah yeah yeah

2595.4 --> 2599.319
yeah

2596.48 --> 2604.44
exactly yeah the Boeing whistleblower

2599.319 --> 2606.48
guy he just basically got

2604.44 --> 2609.52
assassinated I just read that too I

2606.48 --> 2609.52
almost forgot really

2619.8 --> 2623.599
freaky

2621.44 --> 2625.119
so

2623.599 --> 2627.079
right

2625.119 --> 2631.48
yeah yeah this is where I'm going to

2627.079 --> 2631.48
call you out to be a liar box out

2632.079 --> 2640.92
Buster really like you're taking it too

2636.24 --> 2644.52
far like nobody's going to buy that [ __ ]

2640.92 --> 2648.119
yeah to see something that resembles the

2644.52 --> 2650.96
ISS is one thing you're really going to

2648.119 --> 2653.44
claim that you saw the ISS through a

2650.96 --> 2655.64
telescope with something docking on it

2653.44 --> 2656.92
I'm going to call you out for a dirty

2655.64 --> 2660.92
dirty

2656.92 --> 2663.119
liar over that yeah nobody's ever seen

2660.92 --> 2666.04
that anything like

2663.119 --> 2669.04
that you're a

2666.04 --> 2669.04
liar

2676.76 --> 2681.3190000000004
yeah well I don't care that you don't

2678.76 --> 2684.599
care that I think you're a liar you are

2681.319 --> 2684.599
you don't have evidence for

2684.92 --> 2691.6800000000003
that it does not harm you anyway yeah it

2687.8 --> 2691.6800000000003
does because now you're marked as a

2692.16 --> 2696.7999999999997
liar and that means that you're probably

2695.359 --> 2699.0
not going to make it very long in my

2696.8 --> 2702.4
chat

2699.0 --> 2705.079
that cuz once you start that [ __ ]

2702.4 --> 2705.079
there's always

2706.8 --> 2714.44
more

2709.119 --> 2714.44
yeah and now you get a 30 minute

2718.51 --> 2721.659
[Music]

2722.2 --> 2728.0
timeout yeah next time you you're going

2725.52 --> 2731.72

2728.0 --> 2731.72
damn well [ __ ] film it

2744.19 --> 2750.559
[Music]

2746.119 --> 2753.1600000000003

[Music]

2804.68 --> 2809.24
away all right so let's move

2811.44 --> 2818.319
on I don't care how sympathetic you

2815.24 --> 2823.9599999999996
are how going along with whatever I'm

2818.319 --> 2828.079
talking about how I don't care don't

2823.96 --> 2834.079
lie nobody has ever

2828.079 --> 2836.96
once in several decades ever seen

2834.079 --> 2841.599
anything like an activity outside of

2836.96 --> 2845.319
just seeing an apparent ISS sighting

2841.599 --> 2848.319
nobody so you're a

2845.319 --> 2850.64
liar yeah

2848.319 --> 2852.72
you can't just say casually oh I saw

2850.64 --> 2856.0
that through the telescope oh and you

2852.72 --> 2858.5989999999997
didn't record it didn't record the first

2856.0 --> 2861.359
ever sighting of an interaction with the

2858.599 --> 2863.4
supposed ISS through a telescope yeah

2861.359 --> 2866.44
you're just a [ __ ] liar get the hell

2863.4 --> 2868.2400000000002
out of here don't try that again next

2866.44 --> 2869.76
time you're

2868.24 --> 2872.7599999999998
baned

2869.76 --> 2875.6800000000003
yeah because if I had that opportunity

2872.76 --> 2878.96
to see that I would film the [ __ ] out of

2875.68 --> 2881.52
it and and become world famous for being

2878.96 --> 2883.88
the first person ever to actually see a

2881.52 --> 2886.68
physical interaction happening with the

2883.88 --> 2891.599
ISS through a telescope

2886.68 --> 2891.5989999999997
yeah liar get the [ __ ]

2892.079 --> 2896.4
out hello Nathan R good to see

2902.11 --> 2905.2290000000003
[Music]

2905.76 --> 2910.8390000000004
you

2908.359 --> 2912.96
I feel like getting some

2910.839 --> 2914.92
coffee right I'm going to turn on my

2912.96 --> 2917.599
coffee and Illuminati cuss on everything

2914.92 --> 2917.599
I'll be right

2935.72 --> 2938.72
back

2965.72 --> 2968.72
you

2995.64 --> 2998.64
for

3025.64 --> 3028.64
e

3055.64 --> 3058.64
e

3085.559 --> 3089.88
for

3087.119 --> 3089.88
right and I'm

3097.86 --> 3101.05
[Music]

3102.319 --> 3108.7599999999998
back

3104.68 --> 3110.2799999999997
right I mean need I remind everybody of

3108.76 --> 3113.4
the

3110.28 --> 3118.52
fact that the entire

3113.4 --> 3118.52
ISS idea is physically impossible

3120.48 --> 3124.16
I'm bored I like I don't want to do it

3122.52 --> 3126.599
anymore it's just going to be a bunch of

3124.16 --> 3129.799
[ __ ] ball Tarts popping up again

3126.599 --> 3131.52
doing their shitty doy do and I'm just

3129.799 --> 3133.079
going to kick them all out like I don't

3131.52 --> 3136.079
even want to go

3133.079 --> 3136.079
there

3136.599 --> 3142.96
yeah everything about the ISS what they

3139.76 --> 3147.28
claim it is and where it is and what it

3142.96 --> 3150.319
does is physically absolutely impossible

3147.28 --> 3153.96
yeah you can't have something float up

3150.319 --> 3158.04
there unless it's stuck to

3153.96 --> 3159.44
balloons just like the link I posted

3158.04 --> 3163.0
yeah that

3159.44 --> 3167.52
picture that's the extent of the

3163.0 --> 3170.799
possibilities of something remaining up

3167.52 --> 3170.799
there that's

3171.04 --> 3178.44
it oh

3173.4 --> 3178.44
wow it's conspiracy cats

3182.16 --> 3187.24
yeah it's not and it's not just second

3184.88 --> 3189.96
law of Thermodynamics violation Ben

3187.24 --> 3191.8799999999997
Johnston it's also like how is it

3189.96 --> 3194.0
staying up

3191.88 --> 3198.6800000000003
there

3194.0 --> 3202.119
yeah how does that work it can't stay up

3198.68 --> 3204.319
there it's a chunk of metal and plastic

3202.119 --> 3208.559
how is it going to stay up there it

3204.319 --> 3211.119
won't yeah and and you might think that

3208.559 --> 3213.76
oh it's because a certain thing isn't

3211.119 --> 3216.839
there anymore at a certain distance but

3213.76 --> 3219.8390000000004
there's not even a claim to

3216.839 --> 3222.92
that you don't have an explanation you

3219.839 --> 3227.24
just have an idea that's not backed by

3222.92 --> 3227.2400000000002
anything hello Richard G good to

3235.44 --> 3238.44
you

3244.0 --> 3251.0
yeah big chunks of metal and plastic are

3247.559 --> 3255.48
not going to just float up

3251.0 --> 3258.359
there doesn't work why because they're

3255.48 --> 3262.92
definitely going to be a lot more

3258.359 --> 3265.0789999999997
dense than the very thin veiled air that

3262.92 --> 3270.04
will be surrounding it up

3265.079 --> 3273.7200000000003
there yeah so unless there's a

3270.04 --> 3277.5589999999997
gigantic helium hydrogen type balloon

3273.72 --> 3281.3999999999996
and that would keep it up there and

3277.559 --> 3283.44
keep somehow manage to stay up there I

3281.4 --> 3286.839
mean it wouldn't be for long every

3283.44 --> 3290.839
balloon even weather balloons they

3286.839 --> 3292.44
eventually burst they they leak they go

3290.839 --> 3295.92
down

3292.44 --> 3299.319
so a chunk of metal and plastic is not

3295.92 --> 3301.96
just going keep floating up there for

3299.319 --> 3303.24
decades it doesn't work and you don't

3301.96 --> 3307.4
have any

3303.24 --> 3309.8799999999997
mechanisms to justify why it would yeah

3307.4 --> 3314.04
you don't have any

3309.88 --> 3316.76
mechanisms or physics based proven

3314.04 --> 3317.92
claims that would justify how it would

3316.76 --> 3321.6800000000003
even be

3317.92 --> 3324.079
possible yeah CU certainly a lack of

3321.68 --> 3327.0389999999998
gravity isn't going to do it since

3324.079 --> 3330.119
gravity is in the force and it

3327.039 --> 3332.1600000000003
it's not even claimed to be that and the

3330.119 --> 3335.0
only thing that we know and is proven

3332.16 --> 3338.52
through physics to exist is relative

3335.0 --> 3341.76
density and there is no distance limit

3338.52 --> 3344.92
to the functioning of relative

3341.76 --> 3347.28
density oh yeah yeah okay you're bad get

3344.92 --> 3347.28
the [ __ ]

3347.76 --> 3353.2000000000003
out what you think you're going to just

3349.92 --> 3356.0

[Music]

3385.24 --> 3388.24
ever

3395.2 --> 3399.319
yeah I don't care Rich G he can say

3397.599 --> 3401.0
whatever the [ __ ] he wants he has no

3399.319 --> 3403.079
case he has no evidence he made a

3401.0 --> 3406.76
ridiculous claim that's never even been

3403.079 --> 3409.599
claimed before without recording it I

3406.76 --> 3412.44
mean if I'd be with a friend or whatever

3409.599 --> 3415.2400000000002
watching through a telescope seeing the

3412.44 --> 3417.16
ISS I'd be freaking shocked in the first

3415.24 --> 3419.319
instance

3417.16 --> 3422.72
yeah and then you're going to claim you

3419.319 --> 3425.44
see through that [ __ ] telescope the

3422.72 --> 3432.1189999999997
docking of something else and you didn't

3425.44 --> 3436.0
film it I'm sorry you're a

3432.119 --> 3438.039
liar you're just a liar you made that

3436.0 --> 3441.48
[ __ ]

3438.039 --> 3443.48
up like nobody's going to not e like

3441.48 --> 3445.599
even the [ __ ] Globe Community will

3443.48 --> 3448.16
think you're a liar for that you are a

3445.599 --> 3448.1600000000003
liar

3453.079 --> 3457.96
splash down to earth no he wasn't

3454.68 --> 3457.96
talking about that Oro

3460.359 --> 3463.7599999999998
kumble he was

3465.359 --> 3471.7599999999998
not he mentioned the flash down he said

3468.88 --> 3475.799
he saw it docking through a

3471.76 --> 3478.6400000000003
telescope sorry it's just no there's no

3475.799 --> 3481.7599999999998
to be fair about it it's a straight out

3478.64 --> 3483.4
sick lie it's embarrassing and I'm not

3481.76 --> 3485.559
going to have you in my chat anymore I

3483.4 --> 3488.4
gave you one warning you came back with

3485.559 --> 3491.039
your stupid sock account you had another

3488.4 --> 3495.079
chance and now you're

3491.039 --> 3497.7200000000003
gone go make another [ __ ] pseudonym

3495.079 --> 3499.96
fake character and try to sneak in again

3497.72 --> 3504.359
so I can do it over again as soon as you

3499.96 --> 3505.799
make another outrageous lie okay because

3504.359 --> 3508.319
I know you keep trying because you don't

3505.799 --> 3510.839
have a life you're just another one of

3508.319 --> 3513.599
these balard [ __ ] wits that keeps

3510.839 --> 3516.64
wanting to come back to do the same [ __ ]

3513.599 --> 3519.4
over and over again hoping that one day

3516.64 --> 3522.16
the globe [ __ ] lies will rub off and

3519.4 --> 3524.52
I'll let it go well guess what I want I

3522.16 --> 3525.839
will kick you the [ __ ] out that's what

3524.52 --> 3528.72
I'll

3525.839 --> 3531.5589999999997
do and I will keep kicking you the [ __ ]

3528.72 --> 3535.0389999999998
out because you're a [ __ ] liar

3531.559 --> 3537.9100000000003
disgusting sniveling

3535.039 --> 3541.55
liar now piss

3537.91 --> 3541.5499999999997
[Music]

3549.68 --> 3552.739
[Music]

3558.24 --> 3564.16
off yeah and a splash down well who

3561.039 --> 3566.92
gives a [ __ ] about that I mean it's very

3564.16 --> 3570.2799999999997
easy to just take a capsule

3566.92 --> 3573.599
air drop it from an airplane with a

3570.28 --> 3576.28
parachute that's been done before like

3573.599 --> 3579.319
it's been filmed how that was done

3576.28 --> 3583.119
before like even in the

3579.319 --> 3585.0
70s they showed like those capsules that

3583.119 --> 3587.4
were supposedly on top of like Apollo

3585.0 --> 3590.16
type Rockets they showed how they shoved

3587.4 --> 3592.7200000000003
it out of the back of an aircraft

3590.16 --> 3596.5589999999997
carrier and unleash the

3592.72 --> 3600.24
shoot they showed how they did that yeah

3596.559 --> 3600.2400000000002
a splash down doesn't mean

3617.119 --> 3620.92
[ __ ] right

3621.48 --> 3624.96
uh one hour in it's already getting

3624.0 --> 3627.96
quite

3624.96 --> 3627.96
rowdy

3641.92 --> 3647.28
can see people waving back at them

3644.0 --> 3650.119
through the windows of the is say yeah

3647.28 --> 3653.3590000000004
people are nuts and I mean there are

3650.119 --> 3656.6800000000003
alleged sightings of an ISS like

3653.359 --> 3659.44
sighting through telescopes I'm willing

3656.68 --> 3661.319
to go with that and it's a mystery like

3659.44 --> 3664.119
I don't know how that's even happening

3661.319 --> 3665.48
whether it is in ways a natural

3664.119 --> 3668.6800000000003
phenomenon

3665.48 --> 3672.88
somehow or whether that's a man-made

3668.68 --> 3672.8799999999997
influence some in some way

3673.2 --> 3678.5589999999997
influencing the celestial sighting

3676.0 --> 3680.839
somehow I don't know it's it's a big

3678.559 --> 3683.3190000000004
mystery I'm not going to be able to just

3680.839 --> 3687.72
solve that I mean I could make up some

3683.319 --> 3690.88
[ __ ] about it but there's no point to

3687.72 --> 3694.1189999999997
that but what I definitely know is that

3690.88 --> 3696.599
nobody ever has ever seen any

3694.119 --> 3698.76
interaction with

3696.599 --> 3702.2000000000003
it through a

3698.76 --> 3704.5200000000004
telescope if you just see it some if you

3702.2 --> 3707.7599999999998
see the something in a telescope that's

3704.52 --> 3710.48
already spectacular enough mysterious

3707.76 --> 3712.88
enough nobody's ever seen any

3710.48 --> 3716.2
interaction

3712.88 --> 3719.319
ever yeah so then to just casually claim

3716.2 --> 3722.24
that you're just a dirty stinky liar you

3719.319 --> 3722.24
need to get the [ __ ]

3744.839 --> 3747.839
out

3760.2 --> 3765.24
yeah and hey

3761.88 --> 3765.2400000000002
orble you're

3766.359 --> 3772.16
wrong yeah just just to remind let me

3769.16 --> 3772.16
quote from

3772.92 --> 3778.64
242 uh

3774.839 --> 3781.0389999999998
that's roughly 20 minutes ago he said

3778.64 --> 3785.0
though you could actually see their

3781.039 --> 3785.0
craft dock with the ISS

3785.96 --> 3791.4
yeah yeah so he did literally say that I

3789.559 --> 3794.96
don't know why you had to jump out of

3791.4 --> 3800.039
nowhere to supposedly defend him when he

3794.96 --> 3804.76
did literally say that like a

3800.039 --> 3807.0
liar so maybe reconsider jumping out of

3804.76 --> 3809.279
nowhere

3807.0 --> 3809.279
like

3809.68 --> 3814.2999999999997
that

3811.12 --> 3814.2999999999997
[Music]

3815.96 --> 3823.279
right would the p900 be up to the task

3819.4 --> 3823.279
to see the SP I don't think

3825.119 --> 3833.6400000000003
so yes I know Orin wumble I know in the

3830.0 --> 3833.64
news it came back to Earth I

3834.079 --> 3839.119
know okay hold on I need to I'm going to

3837.039 --> 3843.5200000000004
get my Illuminati coffee and I'm going

3839.119 --> 3843.52
to kick the freaking cat out

3864.72 --> 3867.72
get

3894.64 --> 3897.64
e

3924.64 --> 3927.64
e

3940.44 --> 3946.16
really jar CAU it on the

3944.079 --> 3949.119
video

3946.16 --> 3952.3999999999996
huh I didn't know

3949.119 --> 3952.4
that that's

3954.64 --> 3957.64
weird

3961.24 --> 3964.27
[Music]

3971.44 --> 3977.039
but was that with like a p900 or a p1000

3974.96 --> 3977.039
I

3983.44 --> 3987.559
mean it's pretty bizarre

3989.96 --> 3995.92
I mean normally the people that see it

3994.039 --> 3999.6400000000003
like they have like very serious

3995.92 --> 4001.44
telescopes like big tubes and all that

3999.64 --> 4005.5989999999997
like a

4001.44 --> 4008.319
regular Nikon seems like kind of

4005.599 --> 4009.92
unlikely you'd be able to catch it but

4008.319 --> 4013.48
not much

4009.92 --> 4013.48
difference okay

4014.52 --> 4017.52
whatever

4027.76 --> 4031.92
is moving really past can't be a balloon

4029.72 --> 4035.4399999999996
yeah I know because hey if you'd be able

4031.92 --> 4038.64
to see it well you'd be able to see the

4035.44 --> 4039.7200000000003
balloon right I mean the balloon is

4038.64 --> 4043.7599999999998
going to

4039.72 --> 4048.72
be if yeah it doesn't even

4043.76 --> 4048.7200000000003
work lunar train trans it that's

4052.359 --> 4055.359
hilarious

4057.0 --> 4066.88
H wait what are you saying that jiren

4062.359 --> 4069.52
caught the lunar Transit of it or there

4066.88 --> 4072.1600000000003
has been videos supposedly of other

4069.52 --> 4075.2
people that claim that they've done it

4072.16 --> 4078.96
because there's a lot of fraud out there

4075.2 --> 4082.9199999999996
as well well shoted passing okay that's

4078.96 --> 4082.92
weird that is genuinely

4100.04 --> 4105.799
weird all

4102.679 --> 4107.4400000000005
right but uh yeah I mean what whatever

4105.799 --> 4110.96
it

4107.44 --> 4114.08
is it can't be a giant chunk of plastic

4110.96 --> 4118.679
and metal

4114.08 --> 4121.64
floating above the Earth like no

4118.679 --> 4125.64
way but there's something apparently

4121.64 --> 4129.43
something is seen so yeah I mean that

4125.64 --> 4132.4890000000005
shall remain a mystery probably for a

4129.43 --> 4132.4890000000005
[Music]

4134.44 --> 4137.44
while

4163.679 --> 4167.359
oh yeah that happened

4168.839 --> 4173.799
yes yes another subject I guess we moved

4179.159 --> 4185.719
on

4181.12 --> 4185.719
no no I don't give a [ __ ]

4187.6 --> 4194.8
really like what what am I supposed to

4190.719 --> 4195.96
do with it you know I mean even the very

4194.8 --> 4198.92
celes

4195.96 --> 4200.96
themselves are a huge mystery to me I

4198.92 --> 4202.8
don't really care about oh there's this

4200.96 --> 4204.4800000000005
other thing that people claim is like a

4202.8 --> 4208.4400000000005
space

4204.48 --> 4208.44
station I don't really give a

4212.52 --> 4219.120000000001
[ __ ] I know what it isn't I know it

4215.679 --> 4219.12
doesn't prove the Earth is a

4221.0 --> 4227.679
globe so I mean you could all just stare

4224.76 --> 4230.4400000000005
at it and like oh man just I got to

4227.679 --> 4233.04
catch it every time it comes by well

4230.44 --> 4236.12
good luck with that you keep doing that

4233.04 --> 4238.5199999999995
with your life I'll stick to things that

4236.12 --> 4238.5199999999995
have a

4246.36 --> 4254.239
point like trying to figure

4249.679 --> 4257.2390000000005
out like how do the celestials actually

4254.239 --> 4257.239
work

4272.04 --> 4275.04
in the

4280.8 --> 4287.679
what what do you mean in the

4284.239 --> 4290.28
firmament that that sound weird

4287.679 --> 4292.64
nathar so are you of the belief that

4290.28 --> 4295.28
we're surrounded by a glass Dome and all

4292.64 --> 4297.88
the celestial lights are like inside of

4295.28 --> 4297.88
that glass

4299.88 --> 4305.04
Dome it's very

4302.679 --> 4307.8
specific that

4305.04 --> 4312.0
like it is interesting

4307.8 --> 4314.2390000000005
though but it on itself would bring some

4312.0 --> 4316.36
serious

4314.239 --> 4319.599999999999
dilemas

4316.36 --> 4323.32
a liquid Dome no that makes no damn

4319.6 --> 4325.4800000000005
sense yeah liquid is subjected to

4323.32 --> 4328.08
relative density it's not just going to

4325.48 --> 4332.12
stay up there yeah liquid doesn't float

4328.08 --> 4334.44
above super thin veiled air it doesn't

4332.12 --> 4334.44
do

4336.12 --> 4342.44
that right so unless you're a believer

4340.32 --> 4344.84
of a concave

4342.44 --> 4345.839999999999
Earth and that on the other side is

4344.84 --> 4348.04
liquid

4345.84 --> 4352.4400000000005
nothing about it makes sense it's it's

4348.04 --> 4354.56
just no the idea of liquid that's very

4352.44 --> 4359.44
cool but it's going to be outside of a

4354.56 --> 4362.84
solid then cuz liquid will go

4359.44 --> 4365.678999999999
down especially if there's very thin

4362.84 --> 4367.56
veiled air underneath it which is

4365.679 --> 4372.1990000000005
definitely less

4367.56 --> 4372.1990000000005
dense there's nothing to keep the liquid

4372.4 --> 4378.759999999999
there right what who knows if there is a

4376.32 --> 4381.04
dome then there might be liquid on the

4378.76 --> 4385.04
other side of the Dome and blah blah

4381.04 --> 4388.48
blah unprovable things it's just an

4385.04 --> 4391.32
idea it's very fascinating idea I'm sure

4388.48 --> 4391.32
but you can't prove

4393.88 --> 4399.400000000001
it but the liquids definitely don't form

4397.88 --> 4403.2390000000005
a

4399.4 --> 4403.239
barrier that's not how they

4403.96 --> 4410.159
work and a vaporous liquid acrobate

4410.239 --> 4413.919999999999
no then it's not a

4414.32 --> 4420.08
liquid you can't have it be a vapor and

4417.76 --> 4422.52
a liquid at the same time and besides if

4420.08 --> 4422.5199999999995
it's a

4424.52 --> 4431.120000000001
vapor like a vapor of what

4427.4 --> 4436.879999999999
liquid like it makes less sense

4431.12 --> 4441.239
like anything that isn't very thin fill

4436.88 --> 4444.08
helium and hydrogen gas anything

4441.239 --> 4447.28
anything liquid like any conceivable

4444.08 --> 4451.4
element of any sort is going to be more

4447.28 --> 4451.4
dense it makes no sense to make such a

4462.05 --> 4467.04
[Music]

4464.04 --> 4467.04
claim

4469.08 --> 4474.36
right it's actually observable to the

4471.8 --> 4474.360000000001
eye no it

4475.36 --> 4481.12
isn't that's ridiculous thing to say

4478.159 --> 4483.5599999999995
Nathan R come on don't do that don't do

4481.12 --> 4483.5599999999995
at that to

4494.0 --> 4500.44
yourself

4496.92 --> 4503.96
yeah a gas doesn't form a

4500.44 --> 4506.919999999999
barrier it's has to be solid liquid

4503.96 --> 4509.36
can't form a barrier

4506.92 --> 4511.28
either yeah the gas is going to push

4509.36 --> 4514.199
through

4511.28 --> 4517.199
it it's going to go through it CU it's

4514.199 --> 4518.28
going to be less dense and liquids will

4517.199 --> 4521.638999999999
make

4518.28 --> 4523.96
way cuz they're fluid they will go apart

4521.639 --> 4526.96
if something tries to push through

4523.96 --> 4526.96
it

4531.92 --> 4540.08
the barrier however it is I personally

4535.84 --> 4542.360000000001
think it's a flat top but the barrier

4540.08 --> 4544.08
which must be there because there is

4542.36 --> 4545.759999999999
containment there is gas pressure and

4544.08 --> 4548.32
there's a gas pressure gradient in a

4545.76 --> 4550.56
very specific way which means that at a

4548.32 --> 4553.44
certain distance there has to be a

4550.56 --> 4555.56
physical barrier of some sort something

4553.44 --> 4560.159
to physically stop the gas from

4555.56 --> 4562.76
expanding further instantaneously and

4560.159 --> 4567.638999999999
violently it has to be

4562.76 --> 4574.8
solid you can't create a gas tank out of

4567.639 --> 4577.719
a liquid or a gas it has to be

4574.8 --> 4581.360000000001
solid there's no other way there's no

4577.719 --> 4581.36
way in nature that could be

4582.96 --> 4588.52
different they're kind of gel membrane

4585.639 --> 4588.52
like there would be in a

4588.92 --> 4594.32
Cell yeah but a gel membrane doesn't

4591.76 --> 4596.400000000001
work because why does a gel membrane

4594.32 --> 4599.36
work and have an equilibrium and all

4596.4 --> 4600.44
that with the rest of the body because

4599.36 --> 4603.199
there is

4600.44 --> 4606.5599999999995
pressure because there is a solid

4603.199 --> 4609.5199999999995
barrier to create a pressure stable

4606.56 --> 4611.4800000000005
system in order for the gel membrane to

4609.52 --> 4614.360000000001
be able to find an equilibrium with its

4611.48 --> 4617.678999999999
direct surroundings there's no pressure

4614.36 --> 4619.96
that gel membrane is going to rupture

4617.679 --> 4623.2390000000005
instantaneously just as the gas is

4619.96 --> 4623.2390000000005
explosively moving

4624.04 --> 4631.88
away

4626.56 --> 4635.6
yeah it must be solid and

4631.88 --> 4637.4400000000005
hard just think of the giant vacuum

4635.6 --> 4640.4800000000005
chamber of

4637.44 --> 4643.04
NASA that's

4640.48 --> 4646.32
like I don't know how thick it is like

4643.04 --> 4649.36
100 ft thick concrete or thicker inside

4646.32 --> 4655.28
of a mount it's like insanely

4649.36 --> 4655.28
thick just to create decent

4656.159 --> 4664.679
vacuum it must be

4660.36 --> 4669.199
solid very solid not just a little solid

4664.679 --> 4671.679
it has to be super rigid super

4669.199 --> 4675.4
solid like

4671.679 --> 4678.84
immutable immutable unchangeable

4675.4 --> 4682.04
like no atom if it even is comprised of

4678.84 --> 4685.8
atoms would be able to move around in

4682.04 --> 4688.92
any way it has to be that

4685.8 --> 4692.1990000000005
solid otherwise over time entropy would

4688.92 --> 4695.12
set in and then it would burst and then

4692.199 --> 4698.48
boom it's gone all of it everything is

4695.12 --> 4698.48
gone all the gas is

4700.56 --> 4705.76
gone unless there's

4703.76 --> 4709.12
literally

4705.76 --> 4712.679
a non-space barrier right I've argued

4709.12 --> 4715.639
that but I mean you when I do that I

4712.679 --> 4717.0
basically have to get into spatiality

4715.639 --> 4720.0
and not

4717.0 --> 4723.639
within

4720.0 --> 4725.56
physics because thus far we're arguing

4723.639 --> 4728.679
through

4725.56 --> 4730.84
physics the properties of matter in its

4728.679 --> 4733.36
different states and how that works

4730.84 --> 4735.76
that's how we're arguing for it I could

4733.36 --> 4738.239
move beyond that but then I'd be

4735.76 --> 4740.360000000001
threading into a realm that is

4738.239 --> 4742.48
effectively science fiction as well

4740.36 --> 4744.679
because I have no physical proof for it

4742.48 --> 4747.919999999999
I don't have physical proof for

4744.679 --> 4751.84
non-space yeah but yeah if there's

4747.92 --> 4752.84
simply no volume available for matter to

4751.84 --> 4755.6
move

4752.84 --> 4758.8
into because it just

4755.6 --> 4761.92
can't that would be non-space non-space

4758.8 --> 4766.719
would be absolute would be equal to

4761.92 --> 4766.719
absolutely immutably solid matter

4767.199 --> 4771.44
like

4768.159 --> 4774.159
non-space is not subjected to entropy

4771.44 --> 4777.678999999999
because it's literally nothing it's

4774.159 --> 4780.12
nothing and it is per definition the

4777.679 --> 4781.159
inability for matter to be able to move

4780.12 --> 4784.04
into

4781.159 --> 4785.4
it and that could be it too you know

4784.04 --> 4788.44
that could be the barrier it could

4785.4 --> 4791.239
simply be here's the end there's no more

4788.44 --> 4794.4
volume for matter to exist

4791.239 --> 4798.32
in and then that would effectively be a

4794.4 --> 4801.759999999999
per perfectly immutable solid

4798.32 --> 4804.679
barrier right cuz Hey the gas will like

4801.76 --> 4806.84
do its best to like pull and push and do

4804.679 --> 4810.84
everything but there's literally nothing

4806.84 --> 4812.88
there there's no space for it to to push

4810.84 --> 4815.88
in so it's just going

4812.88 --> 4817.32
to go back it's like go back there's no

4815.88 --> 4819.8
more volume

4817.32 --> 4823.08
available yeah that's the only other

4819.8 --> 4825.679
solution I can't prove that through

4823.08 --> 4829.5199999999995
physics but

4825.679 --> 4829.52
to me that sounds potentially

4830.52 --> 4835.96
reasonable any evidence space is a

4833.04 --> 4840.12
vacuum well any evidence that there is a

4835.96 --> 4843.4800000000005
volume available retr right any evidence

4840.12 --> 4846.0
that there is a volume

4843.48 --> 4849.12
available what's the evidence of that

4846.0 --> 4851.12
volume like we have the volume here

4849.12 --> 4853.92
right around us and the gas is there and

4851.12 --> 4857.239
we can move around but what's the

4853.92 --> 4859.4800000000005
evidence that there is infinite volume

4857.239 --> 4861.959999999999
like who came up with this idea of

4859.48 --> 4861.959999999999
infinite

4862.36 --> 4866.96
volume why would you assume that there

4864.679 --> 4871.679
is an infinite

4866.96 --> 4871.679
volume it's just kind of assumed

4871.8 --> 4878.360000000001
because there is more volume available

4874.84 --> 4881.0
than our senses can reach like there's

4878.36 --> 4884.599999999999
more volume available than that we can

4881.0 --> 4886.84
perceive from our vantage point so if

4884.6 --> 4889.56
it's another physicality assumption bias

4886.84 --> 4892.96
that kind of makes us believe like there

4889.56 --> 4895.159000000001
is infinite volume but

4892.96 --> 4897.44
logically when you think about it

4895.159 --> 4899.759999999999
through entropy how could there be

4897.44 --> 4903.4
infinite

4899.76 --> 4903.400000000001
volume that makes no

4913.08 --> 4919.92
sense yeah so very cute Nathan or vapor

4917.12 --> 4921.88
liquid equilibrium surface tension yeah

4919.92 --> 4925.159
all of that only works if there is a

4921.88 --> 4927.84
pressurized system in order for that

4925.159 --> 4930.239
equilibrium of any sort to form right

4927.84 --> 4932.28
just like the equilibrium in the cells

4930.239 --> 4934.4
and the viscosity and everything about

4932.28 --> 4937.32
our body yeah guess what happens when

4934.4 --> 4940.799999999999
you put that in a vacuum chamber it all

4937.32 --> 4944.92
ruptures evaporates it's nothing nothing

4940.8 --> 4949.679
then functions yeah it requires

4944.92 --> 4949.679
containment to have that

4952.28 --> 4959.7699999999995
equilibrium you need the containment

4954.92 --> 4961.92
first or there is no equilibrium of

4959.77 --> 4963.52
[Music]

4961.92 --> 4965.8
anything

4963.52 --> 4968.1990000000005
Infinity hasn't been proven outside of

4965.8 --> 4971.2390000000005
math that's right Rich G I'm very glad

4968.199 --> 4976.44
that you are aware of

4971.239 --> 4976.44
that as we all know math can be

4983.0 --> 4988.76
deceiving all right anyway I'm going to

4985.04 --> 4988.76
take a bite of my Illuminati K and

5003.44 --> 5008.419
cheers

5005.34 --> 5008.419
[Music]

5012.32 --> 5015.199
hope you're all enjoying the

5021.44 --> 5027.4
show 1 hour 20 minutes in time is like

5025.56 --> 5031.719
not flying at all

5027.4 --> 5031.719
today but I mean the show has been

5033.44 --> 5039.5199999999995
interesting definitely don't forget to

5035.96 --> 5039.52
rogin it up if you haven't

5040.159 --> 5043.5599999999995
already thumb it

5050.23 --> 5053.41
[Music]

5058.199 --> 5062.04
up principia

5063.32 --> 5066.32
Mathematica

5069.159 --> 5077.199
okay oh Richard G there is one form of

5074.44 --> 5080.599999999999
infinity only

5077.199 --> 5080.599999999999
one and that's

5084.04 --> 5089.88
inward a

5086.639 --> 5092.4400000000005
spiral a fractal inward

5089.88 --> 5097.32
spiral

5092.44 --> 5097.32
theoretically can be of infinite

5103.08 --> 5108.84
length but not

5105.48 --> 5108.839999999999
outward only

5123.32 --> 5126.32
inward

5130.08 --> 5137.44
which was interestingly

5133.08 --> 5141.96
also explained by Nasim

5137.44 --> 5145.08
haramain it was definitely not a flat

5141.96 --> 5147.2390000000005
earther but he like was into that

5145.08 --> 5150.5199999999995
mathematically they called it the black

5147.239 --> 5150.5199999999995
hole with a

5151.6 --> 5156.2390000000005
wh very interesting stuff

5160.56 --> 5166.6
it probably doesn't hold up as much as

5162.639 --> 5170.400000000001
it seemed to do that was like in 2003

5166.6 --> 5173.1990000000005
that I stumbled upon that long time

5170.4 --> 5175.4
ago but it does follow the same pattern

5173.199 --> 5179.638999999999
he did basically say

5175.4 --> 5181.4
like there is infinity inward also that

5179.639 --> 5187.4400000000005
seems to

5181.4 --> 5187.44
be a lot of you know a lot of spiritual

5188.08 --> 5197.36
Traditions there is hints at it

5192.119 --> 5197.36
like you find greatness inward

5202.34 --> 5205.72
[Music]

5211.28 --> 5214.92
right

5213.239 --> 5218.36
uh

5214.92 --> 5220.84
okay W working gy bear maybe we're in a

5218.36 --> 5224.36
closed pet Tre dish with tiny holes in

5220.84 --> 5227.1990000000005
the lid only the light gases Escape

5224.36 --> 5231.28
slowly through the lid to

5227.199 --> 5231.28
where maybe that's what

5231.88 --> 5239.08
angels and they have all

5235.8 --> 5242.360000000001
squeaky okay that's just

5239.08 --> 5244.239
lame don't ruin it Woodwork and gny bear

5242.36 --> 5245.08
we're having a very serious discussion

5244.239 --> 5247.5199999999995
right

5245.08 --> 5251.36
now

5247.52 --> 5253.76
yeah spitballing yeah but this is just

5251.36 --> 5258.48
this not spitballing this is Goof

5253.76 --> 5261.639
balling we're talking about actual more

5258.48 --> 5264.718999999999
yeah physics based reasoning and all

5261.639 --> 5266.8
that yeah I mean oh we're in this oh

5264.719 --> 5268.56
there's whole through it oh so we're not

5266.8 --> 5271.360000000001
in that so there's something else then

5268.56 --> 5274.96
we we're in what are we in

5271.36 --> 5278.32
then we're in a thing it has holes in it

5274.96 --> 5280.6
oh really so what is that thing in then

5278.32 --> 5282.679
yeah or are you just going to say at

5280.6 --> 5284.639
some point well there's something out

5282.679 --> 5289.679
there but I don't

5284.639 --> 5289.679
know well now we are

5302.88 --> 5310.0
nowhere it's fine I'm not going to get

5306.56 --> 5312.84
angry over it but I mean it is a bit

5310.0 --> 5312.84
silly to say

5313.48 --> 5318.5599999999995
that I really think that my solution of

5316.199 --> 5320.719
the non-space like yeah there's simply

5318.56 --> 5322.320000000001
no more volume available for matter to

5320.719 --> 5327.2390000000005
exist

5322.32 --> 5327.239
in to me that seems like a logical

5328.08 --> 5335.96
solution although yeah that can create

5331.159 --> 5338.839999999999
some claustrophobia to some people

5335.96 --> 5341.08
right people already had claustrophobia

5338.84 --> 5342.679
like with the idea of the Flat Earth

5341.08 --> 5344.239
with a dome and they're like oh we want

5342.679 --> 5349.1990000000005
to get out of the

5344.239 --> 5352.48
Dome like the people are like that right

5349.199 --> 5355.08
arguably if that even really happened

5352.48 --> 5356.678999999999
operation Fishbowl to try to blow up the

5355.08 --> 5359.639
dome

5356.679 --> 5363.04
right allegedly I don't even know if

5359.639 --> 5366.88
that really happened since atomic bombs

5363.04 --> 5366.88
literally don't exist it's a giant

5367.04 --> 5370.04
scop

5370.08 --> 5376.4
but that's what people do and what would

5373.92 --> 5379.679
be the only solution to

5376.4 --> 5383.0
that well what if the barrier just isn't

5379.679 --> 5386.08
a physical thing it's just no more

5383.0 --> 5387.96
space like this is where the simulation

5386.08 --> 5389.679
ends that's how it would feel like oh

5387.96 --> 5392.8
this is just the barrier of the holiday

5389.679 --> 5396.08
there simply isn't anything beyond it

5392.8 --> 5400.119000000001
like anything it's just

5396.08 --> 5404.28
nothing not not empty space just nothing

5400.119 --> 5404.28
no volume available it just

5404.56 --> 5412.76
ends yeah but that would make the

5409.0 --> 5416.159
claustrophobia Pro potentially

5412.76 --> 5419.8
worse right well if you're told oh we're

5416.159 --> 5421.839999999999
surrounded by a dome then people could

5419.8 --> 5422.679
still think like I want to go through

5421.84 --> 5425.1990000000005
the

5422.679 --> 5426.96
dome but if it's literally like no

5425.199 --> 5428.759999999999
there's literally no more volume

5426.96 --> 5431.56
available you can't go through it

5428.76 --> 5433.639
because there is nothing there literally

5431.56 --> 5436.04
nothing no volume

5433.639 --> 5438.0
nothing it's the end of physical

5436.04 --> 5440.0
existence beyond

5438.0 --> 5443.04
that

5440.0 --> 5445.56
well you can't fantasize about doing

5443.04 --> 5445.56
anything with

5452.92 --> 5455.92
it

5456.76 --> 5464.08
so yeah and if that would happen I mean

5461.48 --> 5467.638999999999
just imagine that mankind for some

5464.08 --> 5469.08
reason found a barrier of non-space at

5467.639 --> 5473.4400000000005
first they think like oh this some kind

5469.08 --> 5475.92
of super hard glass or something it's

5473.44 --> 5475.919999999999
unchippable

5476.6 --> 5481.4800000000005
undent but if they eventually figur it

5479.36 --> 5482.92
out like there's something really

5481.48 --> 5487.919999999999
strange going on

5482.92 --> 5487.92
here like it's literally

5488.44 --> 5492.36
nothing that

5490.48 --> 5496.04
would

5492.36 --> 5497.119
probably reinforce the idea of it's all

5496.04 --> 5500.639
a

5497.119 --> 5503.08
simulation more than anything anybody

5500.639 --> 5503.08
could ever

5504.36 --> 5510.679
imagine because people will refuse to

5507.719 --> 5512.84
accept that there isn't infinite

5510.679 --> 5515.88
available

5512.84 --> 5517.52
volume when they bump into it physically

5515.88 --> 5519.159000000001
like there's no more volume they will

5517.52 --> 5522.159000000001
just not accept it and then they will

5519.159 --> 5524.799999999999
think well then nothing is real you know

5522.159 --> 5528.638999999999
this is how people work right in their

5524.8 --> 5532.08
minds their egos will refuse to

5528.639 --> 5534.0
submit like what there's an end of space

5532.08 --> 5537.44
well that would mean that nothing is

5534.0 --> 5540.56
real there must be another reality then

5537.44 --> 5543.119
in which there is right it's like I'm

5540.56 --> 5545.320000000001
enclosed in nons space this can't be

5543.119 --> 5547.96
real this must be a simulation to trap

5545.32 --> 5552.04
us we have to get out of this Matrix to

5547.96 --> 5554.36
go back to the real globe in outer space

5552.04 --> 5557.119
because it has to be

5554.36 --> 5559.92
real yeah that's what would happen

5557.119 --> 5561.199
because people are [ __ ] pathetic and

5559.92 --> 5564.76
they do

5561.199 --> 5564.759999999999
that well Shan

5572.84 --> 5575.84
G

5582.04 --> 5588.199
non-space a geometric argument

5585.8 --> 5592.719
no it's

5588.199 --> 5593.678999999999
a spatial argument it's about volume

5592.719 --> 5595.96
about

5593.679 --> 5599.1990000000005
volumetrics it's not about geometry

5595.96 --> 5599.199
geometry are about

5602.76 --> 5607.639
surfaces

5605.719 --> 5609.4800000000005
it's specifically

5607.639 --> 5612.88
non-geometric

5609.48 --> 5616.959999999999
although if there is a specific

5612.88 --> 5620.08
volume available for matter to exist in

5616.96 --> 5622.8
then that specific volume could be

5620.08 --> 5625.239
expressed geometrically by basically

5622.8 --> 5629.28
inversing it

5625.239 --> 5632.239
all like where is the barrier of

5629.28 --> 5635.04
non-space with volume available for

5632.239 --> 5637.119
matter and that might be able to be

5635.04 --> 5641.28
expressed in a

5637.119 --> 5641.28
geometry if we could ever figure it

5643.28 --> 5649.759999999999
out but the non-space in itself isn't

5647.56 --> 5652.0
geometric hey seeking star water good

5649.76 --> 5652.0
see

5655.92 --> 5661.31
you andira

5658.21 --> 5661.31
[Music]

5662.56 --> 5665.719
me hm

5687.32 --> 5692.159
M

5689.04 --> 5694.6
what I do actually believe that at a

5692.159 --> 5696.638999999999
certain point what we consider physics

5694.6 --> 5699.76
won't apply to the

5696.639 --> 5703.56
creation that makes no

5699.76 --> 5708.4400000000005
sense I mean creation is specifically

5703.56 --> 5708.4400000000005
physical and of course there is the

5710.04 --> 5716.6
spiritual but that's not

5713.6 --> 5716.6
really

5717.6 --> 5722.679
creation that's just spiritual that's

5720.28 --> 5725.0
like creation I mean even like in the

5722.679 --> 5727.6
use of it

5725.0 --> 5730.48
Bible and everything that's the creation

5727.6 --> 5730.4800000000005
of the physical

5730.52 --> 5737.2390000000005
world because you can't claim that

5734.92 --> 5740.719
spiritual things are created or

5737.239 --> 5740.718999999999
destroyed there's no

5743.56 --> 5749.639
evidence laws of physics yeah well the

5745.92 --> 5752.4800000000005
laws of physics apply to the physical

5749.639 --> 5756.400000000001
reality not to the

5752.48 --> 5756.4
spiritual that's that's why it's called

5758.52 --> 5763.0
physics and it's not really laws of

5760.8 --> 5765.76
physics by the way it's just natural

5763.0 --> 5769.52
law the laws of the physical and natural

5765.76 --> 5769.52
world but it

5769.96 --> 5773.8
yeah your mistake is

5782.56 --> 5785.56
Forgiven

5797.239 --> 5801.5
are you all enjoying the

5798.679 --> 5804.7390000000005
show I do feel like I'm in form

5801.5 --> 5804.739
[Music]

5811.44 --> 5817.0
again getting technical I like it I like

5814.92 --> 5818.92
it when I have this opportunity to get

5817.0 --> 5824.0
all Technical and draw

5818.92 --> 5824.0
in these fascinating conceptions like

5824.719 --> 5829.6
non-space it's not that easy to like

5827.8 --> 5834.04
basically address it I

5829.6 --> 5834.04
mean to just bring it out of

5834.32 --> 5841.5599999999995
nowhere usually people are just like

5838.159 --> 5844.48
what but when we get into a discussion

5841.56 --> 5847.04
deeply then people

5844.48 --> 5851.36
are more inclined to understand what it

5847.04 --> 5851.36
actually implies and what it stands

5866.84 --> 5872.4400000000005
for creation of the physical world

5869.48 --> 5874.36
itself requires breaking love

5872.44 --> 5877.799999999999
uh

5874.36 --> 5880.759999999999
well would work in gy Bear nobody said

5877.8 --> 5880.76
that the

5881.4 --> 5886.159
Creator

5883.119 --> 5888.92
like the laws of thermodynamics don't

5886.159 --> 5888.92
apply to the

5892.639 --> 5899.36
Creator it only applies to the physical

5895.84 --> 5902.119000000001
world once it was

5899.36 --> 5906.28
manifested and then there's the weird

5902.119 --> 5910.199
complications even within creation story

5906.28 --> 5915.199
everywhere that basically says that the

5910.199 --> 5915.199
Creator is more of a designer and a

5916.36 --> 5922.639
reshaper like I sometimes think that the

5919.76 --> 5925.52
physical reality was

5922.639 --> 5926.639
created when before there was only a

5925.52 --> 5930.8
spiritual

5926.639 --> 5934.119
reality but even in Genesis it's like

5930.8 --> 5937.2390000000005
described how God arrived in a already

5934.119 --> 5940.239
physical world and then started to like

5937.239 --> 5940.239
rematerialize

5943.0 --> 5947.36
things barrier of not it's not a

5952.04 --> 5958.44
barrier yeah there's no space Oh there's

5956.0 --> 5962.36
just nothing in between no there is no

5958.44 --> 5964.04
in between it's the end of available

5962.36 --> 5967.36
volume

5964.04 --> 5970.639
it's not a barrier it's

5967.36 --> 5972.5199999999995
just the the point where matter can no

5970.639 --> 5976.08
longer exist

5972.52 --> 5979.88
it it's not going to be a a

5976.08 --> 5983.32
band it's simply no more volume

5979.88 --> 5983.32
available after that point at

5992.32 --> 5995.32
all

6001.48 --> 6004.48
yeah [ __ ] off

6012.96 --> 6018.4
[ __ ] oh emailed me a picture cool I'll

6016.119 --> 6018.4
check it

6022.32 --> 6025.32

looking through that g that uh what do

6102.639 --> 6105.119
you call

6106.04 --> 6111.92
gaze it's kind of taking away the sides

6109.719 --> 6111.92
of

6112.239 --> 6115.239

okay

6320.599 --> 6325.679
okay oh wow that looks

6325.92 --> 6330.08
amazing I'll definitely share that

6342.84 --> 6349.679
one yeah so secing star would to sent me

6346.119 --> 6349.679
this I mean that's

6351.92 --> 6356.36
amazing

6353.44 --> 6356.36
let have the best

6360.679 --> 6365.76
pictures photographs I mean definitely

6366.599 --> 6370.08
photograph thank you for

6441.84 --> 6450.96
yeah

6443.11 --> 6450.96
[Music]

6472.639 --> 6477.84
and

6474.4 --> 6477.839999999999
are you a little behind Richard

6478.01 --> 6483.159000000001
[Music]

6481.0 --> 6487.48
G the

6483.159 --> 6487.48
video that's okay though

6501.76 --> 6508.84
but

6504.679 --> 6512.639
oh yeah almost forgot

6508.84 --> 6514.92
clear sent me the link uh two days ago

6512.639 --> 6514.92
it's

6515.36 --> 6521.92
now

6517.44 --> 6524.799999999999
uh the insane Arctic balloon Expedition

6521.92 --> 6526.679
I did watch that yesterday man that was

6524.8 --> 6529.719
kind of

6526.679 --> 6533.2390000000005
grim like they're going out in a balloon

6529.719 --> 6535.159
like after two days they crash like

6533.239 --> 6538.799999999999
after two days

6535.159 --> 6541.4
[ __ ] and then like they try to get back

6538.8 --> 6544.8
it takes three months and then they just

6541.4 --> 6547.08
get attacked by polar bears and die it's

6544.8 --> 6547.08
like

6561.719 --> 6564.719
terrible

6567.96 --> 6571.44
also makes me think that

6572.159 --> 6578.4
yeah balloons like that are not just the

6575.639 --> 6578.400000000001
solution as

6578.56 --> 6585.04
much like even a zapolin right I had

6582.8 --> 6588.360000000001
that idea of like a

6585.04 --> 6588.36
zapolin that's

6590.04 --> 6594.639
tough hey what's that

6598.52 --> 6604.040000000001
back TI

6600.599 --> 6604.04
what what is

6620.56 --> 6624.639
that oh

6628.52 --> 6632.2390000000005
okay alternative

6641.48 --> 6645.718999999999
biology all

6643.28 --> 6648.96
right that looks very interesting even

6645.719 --> 6648.96
though it's just 10 minutes

6651.639 --> 6660.04
long zapolin can fall down go boom

6656.32 --> 6663.96
yeah but I mean a zapin will be

6660.04 --> 6667.239
like much more effective than just a

6663.96 --> 6671.719
balloon right a balloon just drifts a

6667.239 --> 6675.36
zapolin can be stared and of course it's

6671.719 --> 6675.36
not the 19th century

6676.239 --> 6683.119
anymore so there's lighter

6679.8 --> 6685.0
materials so it can be just made

6683.119 --> 6687.5199999999995
way more

6685.0 --> 6691.679
efficiently like you can technically

6687.52 --> 6696.2390000000005
even like have the zapin be light enough

6691.679 --> 6698.88
to store extra gas tanks so it's like Oh

6696.239 --> 6700.959999999999
it's leaking it always will be you can

6698.88 --> 6705.52
fill it back

6700.96 --> 6708.159
up so they I'm just it made me think

6705.52 --> 6710.56
again like you could do the same thing

6708.159 --> 6713.199
as those guys those Pioneers that

6710.56 --> 6715.599
perished unfortunately for them

6713.199 --> 6719.04
but with an actual

6715.599 --> 6722.52
zappelin with modern Composite

6719.04 --> 6724.8
Materials like super sturdy Plastics

6722.52 --> 6728.360000000001
lower leak

6724.8 --> 6729.96
rate and they used food as extra weight

6728.36 --> 6732.598999999999
and all that to keep them at the right

6729.96 --> 6736.36
height but like yeah what's the stop you

6732.599 --> 6740.2390000000005
to like literally have compressed gas

6736.36 --> 6743.079
tanks part of the weight it's like

6740.239 --> 6746.919999999999
uhoh we're losing gas we're going down

6743.079 --> 6750.32
okay well then just fill it back

6746.92 --> 6752.76
up right those tanks functioning as

6750.32 --> 6752.759999999999
extra

6753.599 --> 6758.679
weight like it could work

6760.28 --> 6766.88
now so yeah thank you Cleary for sharing

6763.32 --> 6766.88
that dock with

6766.92 --> 6774.4400000000005
me it was very Grim but inspiring

6771.44 --> 6774.44
nonetheless

6779.74 --> 6782.889999999999
[Music]

6792.28 --> 6798.92
at the be and just for good measure I'll

6795.719 --> 6801.44
copy that link in here

6798.92 --> 6806.8
again so you could check it

6801.44 --> 6810.28
out 21 22 minute

6806.8 --> 6813.28
documentary like it like in the 19th

6810.28 --> 6813.28
century that's pretty

6818.239 --> 6825.04
amazing basically late exploration

6821.48 --> 6825.959999999999
age cuz in the 18th century there was a

6825.04 --> 6829.28
lot

6825.96 --> 6831.599
of like Continental

6829.28 --> 6834.88
exploration and it's really like in the

6831.599 --> 6837.719
1900s where they like took it further

6834.88 --> 6840.36
and like okay what's left well the

6837.719 --> 6840.36
Arctic and

6842.92 --> 6850.719
Antarctic which is like way more

6847.119 --> 6850.719
deadly more

6861.36 --> 6864.36
hazardous

6891.32 --> 6894.32
for

6921.32 --> 6924.32
for

6925.76 --> 6931.400000000001
it's still kind of weird though that

6928.199 --> 6931.4
with the whole Arctic

6932.719 --> 6937.599
stuff

6934.52 --> 6941.119000000001
like there there seems to be like very

6937.599 --> 6944.119000000001
little confirmation that there really is

6941.119 --> 6948.5199999999995
this North Pole Point

6944.119 --> 6948.5199999999995
somehow that there's not further

6951.239 --> 6954.239
Beyond

6974.32 --> 6978.44
it makes me think like in different

6976.36 --> 6980.28
ideas because yeah of course you could

6978.44 --> 6981.799999999999
consider like oh maybe at some point it

6980.28 --> 6984.44
stops getting cold and then it gets a

6981.8 --> 6986.4800000000005
bit warmer and then you get these other

6984.44 --> 6988.48
regions in these mountain ranges and the

6986.48 --> 6993.5199999999995
rivers and all

6988.48 --> 6995.919999999999
that or it is more like

6993.52 --> 7000.88
a Antarctica

6995.92 --> 7000.88
situation where like the cold gets even

7001.56 --> 7008.159000000001
worse and there might be an ice wall of

7005.84 --> 7009.360000000001
some kind that's like very similar to

7008.159 --> 7011.239
the ice

7009.36 --> 7014.239
wall in

7011.239 --> 7014.239
Antarctica

7014.28 --> 7018.96
might be very high up and then people

7017.119 --> 7022.88
will say yeah that's

7018.96 --> 7025.84
actually the fir it's like up to the

7022.88 --> 7029.679
firmament the barrier of some kind right

7025.84 --> 7029.679
people claim that but you don't really

7032.56 --> 7036.76
know but yeah I wonder

7036.96 --> 7044.96
sometimes I really do like is there

7040.679 --> 7048.56
actually a barri of some kind in the

7044.96 --> 7048.56
North or isn't

7050.02 --> 7053.279
[Music]

7057.36 --> 7064.199
there because if there would be then the

7060.44 --> 7066.239
idea of bagel Earth which oh Benjamin

7064.199 --> 7068.719
brought up like a few days

7066.239 --> 7072.759999999999
ago it might

7068.719 --> 7076.0
actually hold some legitimacy to it some

7072.76 --> 7079.56
but I mean not very

7076.0 --> 7083.639
conclusive the the map projection of the

7079.56 --> 7083.639
disc the scale is still

7084.96 --> 7091.639
off but from the perspective of the dis

7088.92 --> 7094.52
nor yeah Polaris centered

7091.639 --> 7097.8
map if there's a barrier at the north at

7094.52 --> 7101.119000000001
some point then the idea of bagel

7097.8 --> 7104.119000000001
Earth would not be all that

7101.119 --> 7104.119
weird

7104.36 --> 7110.079
right so instead of like a tunnel then

7108.0 --> 7112.92
like the rectangular looping projection

7110.079 --> 7116.119
which suggests it's projected

7112.92 --> 7116.119
into a

7117.079 --> 7123.119
bagel so

7120.0 --> 7126.8
maybe maybe they're on to something with

7123.119 --> 7126.799999999999
that what do you guys

7131.04 --> 7135.4
think

7133.719 --> 7138.2390000000005
or is it time to round out the show

7135.4 --> 7139.679
since Sly nobody's speaking up for six

7138.239 --> 7142.678999999999
minutes

7139.679 --> 7142.679
straight

7144.159 --> 7149.0
seven I mean I've gone for two hours I I

7146.88 --> 7151.639
can't just round out if everybody's just

7149.0 --> 7151.639
going away

7153.84 --> 7157.4800000000005
now Truman

7161.04 --> 7164.04
ches

7165.8 --> 7170.76
maybe the bagel Earth idea like that is

7168.76 --> 7173.88
basically

7170.76 --> 7177.56
just the only difference between oh it's

7173.88 --> 7180.28
a disc with the Dome is that there is no

7177.56 --> 7181.96
claim to be Center Point there's no

7180.28 --> 7183.599
point where you can literally stand

7181.96 --> 7185.96
right under Polaris and it's at the

7183.599 --> 7187.88
center of the flat earth right that's a

7185.96 --> 7190.199
difference instead of that being a

7187.88 --> 7192.84
Center Point there's a

7190.199 --> 7194.638999999999
barrier that's basically blocking you

7192.84 --> 7197.84
from getting to that Center Point and

7194.639 --> 7200.4400000000005
potentially an ice wall as the typical

7197.84 --> 7201.599
disc earthers claim there is an ice wall

7200.44 --> 7205.598999999999
at the

7201.599 --> 7209.56
Antarctic against the dome but who knows

7205.599 --> 7211.4400000000005
maybe that is the same at the presumed

7209.56 --> 7214.0
to be Center

7211.44 --> 7216.799999999999
Point and then yeah it would kind of

7214.0 --> 7216.8
look like a b

7217.04 --> 7223.88
go like the

7220.199 --> 7229.119
firmament would then be like a bagel

7223.88 --> 7229.119
basically right if you look at it like

7233.32 --> 7240.88
that but I mean I still think it's just

7237.079 --> 7240.88
more logical that there's a flat

7243.239 --> 7251.0
top this is all this this Assumption of

7247.639 --> 7253.0
barriers right it's kind of tiresome

7251.0 --> 7254.84
it's tiresome that is like every time

7253.0 --> 7256.28
it's like yeah but what if it's there's

7254.84 --> 7259.2390000000005
a barrier

7256.28 --> 7262.079
there and nobody's ever freaking bumped

7259.239 --> 7264.919999999999
into it yet or if they did they never

7262.079 --> 7268.199
reported on it or

7264.92 --> 7271.639
whatever so it remains open is there

7268.199 --> 7274.119
more Lands Beyond is there another realm

7271.639 --> 7276.52
segment beyond the North and the South

7274.119 --> 7280.759999999999
right or isn't there is there this

7276.52 --> 7284.400000000001
barrier like there's no conclusive

7280.76 --> 7284.400000000001
evidence if in either

7285.36 --> 7293.48
direction and you can't like oh back

7289.8 --> 7296.599
engineer like oh it definitely has to be

7293.48 --> 7299.598999999999
there based on everything else that

7296.599 --> 7303.1990000000005
surrounded like it it's not

7299.599 --> 7307.2390000000005
working like the closest we get is like

7303.199 --> 7309.5599999999995
uh Admiral Bird's report on how after a

7307.239 --> 7311.4
certain what is that southern parallel

7309.56 --> 7313.84
the airplanes wouldn't be able to fly

7311.4 --> 7313.839999999999
anymore

7314.0 --> 7319.56
like that's like the closest hint at

7317.8 --> 7321.96
there actually being some kind of

7319.56 --> 7324.079000000001
physical obstruction but how do you know

7321.96 --> 7326.84
that is because of a physical

7324.079 --> 7328.5599999999995
obstruction and not just because the

7326.84 --> 7333.56
conditions are too

7328.56 --> 7336.52
hazardous for devices to work you see

7333.56 --> 7339.52
it's it's so it's very frustrating if

7336.52 --> 7339.52
you're trying to figure it

7340.84 --> 7343.84
out

7368.199 --> 7373.839999999999
going buy the north Centric stuff yeah

7370.48 --> 7373.839999999999
me neither

7394.52 --> 7400.719
I'm just wondering also

7397.92 --> 7403.8
like like what could you do to break

7400.719 --> 7407.04
through this EXT these ice extremities

7403.8 --> 7410.119000000001
right other than an ice breaker

7407.04 --> 7412.04
ship which is still kind of limited I

7410.119 --> 7416.4
mean you

7412.04 --> 7417.96
can't there's yeah only a certain level

7416.4 --> 7419.48
of ice you can break through if it

7417.96 --> 7420.88
becomes like really high you're not

7419.48 --> 7423.959999999999
going to be able to break anything with

7420.88 --> 7426.639
it it just be stuck next to

7423.96 --> 7428.2390000000005
it and you always risk that if you stand

7426.639 --> 7430.719
still you're going to freeze in and then

7428.239 --> 7434.44
you can't even break out again and then

7430.719 --> 7437.32
the ice will lit crunch you but what if

7434.44 --> 7440.199
you could it's a ridiculous idea

7437.32 --> 7442.719
perhaps what if you could like have a

7440.199 --> 7446.0
submarine with like a really heavy

7442.719 --> 7448.88
nuclear power plant in it that could

7446.0 --> 7451.0
just like

7448.88 --> 7455.559
heat its

7451.0 --> 7457.84
alterior but like really a lot like not

7455.559 --> 7463.719
just like warming up that things that it

7457.84 --> 7463.719
doesn't but like real like super hot

7464.0 --> 7471.32
so that you could like just almost like

7467.199 --> 7474.4
go through an ice just just melt

7471.32 --> 7476.84
straight through it and then

7474.4 --> 7477.799999999999
potentially the back would freeze back

7476.84 --> 7480.32
up

7477.8 --> 7482.400000000001
right yeah I just came up with that idea

7480.32 --> 7484.5199999999995
just now but I mean it's still freaking

7482.4 --> 7486.759999999999
crazy how the hell would you like be in

7484.52 --> 7486.76
that

7488.719 --> 7495.0
thing because if at some point the cold

7491.48 --> 7498.199
would just be totally intable well the

7495.0 --> 7499.92
only way to meet that and to be able to

7498.199 --> 7504.0
bypass it is

7499.92 --> 7507.119
to have an equal and opposite amount of

7504.0 --> 7508.159
heat somehow to do that but I mean it is

7507.119 --> 7512.119
quite

7508.159 --> 7515.4
insane to just have like a

7512.119 --> 7517.598999999999
like a submarine that's basically red

7515.4 --> 7523.638999999999
hot glowing on the outside just to

7517.599 --> 7523.639
counter the heat I mean yikes you know

7524.599 --> 7529.599
like have the submarine just have like a

7528.28 --> 7531.28
high

7529.599 --> 7534.599
radioactive

7531.28 --> 7537.44
plating that is just continually hot

7534.599 --> 7540.719
it's like always

7537.44 --> 7543.32
hot that's crazy though like how the

7540.719 --> 7546.76
hell do you even like if being in that

7543.32 --> 7549.0
thing would be like a severe Hazard or

7546.76 --> 7552.400000000001
unless you have like super

7549.0 --> 7554.4
thick uh lead plating

7552.4 --> 7556.199
so that it's like on the outside you

7554.4 --> 7559.079
have like this heavy

7556.199 --> 7562.079
uranium plating that just Heats

7559.079 --> 7565.799999999999
everything directly it would be like the

7562.079 --> 7568.639
equivalent of having like a thousand

7565.8 --> 7571.28
nuclear power plants worth of uranium

7568.639 --> 7573.599
just as the outside plating and then

7571.28 --> 7575.4
super thick lead on the inside just to

7573.599 --> 7578.88
be able to protect the people that are

7575.4 --> 7583.159
in it it's so freaking hazardous and

7578.88 --> 7585.599
insane that like there just no way any

7583.159 --> 7588.719
government anywhere would ever green

7585.599 --> 7591.679
light under any circumstances it's so

7588.719 --> 7594.4800000000005
crazy but I mean that might in my mind

7591.679 --> 7596.639
is like yeah if you have to like go

7594.48 --> 7601.839999999999
right through an ice wall that's like

7596.639 --> 7605.159000000001
hundreds of meters high and like at like

7601.84 --> 7608.400000000001
one Kelvin or something like how the

7605.159 --> 7610.5199999999995
hell else would you ever even attempt to

7608.4 --> 7612.44
like go through

7610.52 --> 7614.119000000001
that

7612.44 --> 7618.04
well that would be the way but I mean

7614.119 --> 7618.04
it's totally insane

7629.92 --> 7635.4800000000005
practically going to re the reactor on

7632.32 --> 7635.48
the yeah I've heard it's

7640.52 --> 7645.92
ridiculous

7643.28 --> 7645.92
of course they

7649.159 --> 7658.0
are but I mean like just so sorry I mean

7654.199 --> 7658.0
it is stupid it's a stupid

7660.76 --> 7666.4800000000005
idea like just getting enough materials

7664.4 --> 7669.719
and it's like not like a nuclear power

7666.48 --> 7672.28
plant is really light framed or anything

7669.719 --> 7673.719
it's a pretty heavy device

7672.28 --> 7675.759999999999
like how the hell are you going to

7673.719 --> 7677.76
transport all that material there

7675.76 --> 7680.320000000001
theoretically if it was actually a place

7677.76 --> 7682.96
you could go to it's just how do you

7680.32 --> 7682.96
come up with

7683.92 --> 7689.119
that really you're going to start with

7686.0 --> 7690.88
the nuclear power plant how about a

7689.119 --> 7693.159
freaking

7690.88 --> 7695.76
tent with a few

7693.159 --> 7697.92
people I mean that seems already

7695.76 --> 7701.119000000001
hazardous enough Oh no you're going to

7697.92 --> 7703.4400000000005
just build a nuclear power plant oh okay

7701.119 --> 7703.44
right

7723.04 --> 7730.36
whatever yeah probably Rich

7727.4 --> 7733.96
G but I mean only if they'd be silly

7730.36 --> 7733.96
enough to believe that that could be

7736.26 --> 7739.409000000001
[Music]

7742.239 --> 7747.04
real I mean seriously like oh we're

7744.84 --> 7748.679
going to build a nuclear power plant on

7747.04 --> 7755.119
the on the moon oh

7748.679 --> 7757.36
really when like 34s of countries that

7755.119 --> 7759.558999999999
like spend significant amount of money

7757.36 --> 7763.88
to supposedly go to the

7759.559 --> 7763.88
moon and they're not even doing it

7764.0 --> 7771.96
man and like 34 of them like fail and

7768.159 --> 7774.48
the crash land and like oh oh well 3/4

7771.96 --> 7776.84
of people crash land there well we'll

7774.48 --> 7779.839999999999
just build a nuclear power plant like

7776.84 --> 7782.360000000001
what how the hell are you supposed to do

7779.84 --> 7783.639
that what makes you think you could do

7782.36 --> 7786.48
that

7783.639 --> 7790.32
successfully if it was physically

7786.48 --> 7792.32
possible to even do that it's so it's

7790.32 --> 7795.88
just

7792.32 --> 7799.558999999999
it gets tiresome it's like my Ballwin is

7795.88 --> 7799.559
getting a headache from that

7801.0 --> 7807.639
[ __ ] like

7803.199 --> 7809.96
stop acting so ridiculous if you're

7807.639 --> 7813.92
going to make up space science fiction

7809.96 --> 7817.04
stop being so damn ridiculous about it

7813.92 --> 7821.04
it's really getting tedious

7817.04 --> 7823.559
guys stop making it worse stop making it

7821.04 --> 7823.559
come on more

7833.28 --> 7840.84
convoluted like could you please

7837.079 --> 7845.32
attempt to seem a little bit more

7840.84 --> 7847.88
realistic I mean could you

7845.32 --> 7850.239
please I know I'm a flat earther and all

7847.88 --> 7853.2390000000005
but it's just getting super

7850.239 --> 7853.239
tedious

7872.079 --> 7876.199
but I mean are they just going to then

7874.199 --> 7878.5199999999995
claim like oh yeah we now have a nuclear

7876.199 --> 7883.0
power plant there are they're going to

7878.52 --> 7885.079000000001
explain like how that actually happened

7883.0 --> 7887.96
how many freaking Rockets are going are

7885.079 --> 7889.558999999999
they supposedly going to send up to

7887.96 --> 7891.559
supply the

7889.559 --> 7892.4400000000005
materials how the hell are they going to

7891.559 --> 7895.52
build

7892.44 --> 7897.678999999999
it are are they going to have Engineers

7895.52 --> 7899.76
go up there and build it or is it all

7897.679 --> 7904.679
like a robot that's going to build it it

7899.76 --> 7907.679
just there too many questions it

7904.679 --> 7907.679
seems

7909.119 --> 7915.28
just it seems as ridiculous as the

7912.84 --> 7917.52
original moon

7915.28 --> 7919.44
landings like with the technology they

7917.52 --> 7922.679
had back then that they succeeded it's

7919.44 --> 7925.0
like it's becoming the same level of

7922.679 --> 7928.079
ridiculousness in the modern

7925.0 --> 7932.079
era in this time frame it's just

7928.079 --> 7935.679
like like that's too much it's too far

7932.079 --> 7937.679
it makes no sense just like the American

7935.679 --> 7940.28
moon landings at that time with the

7937.679 --> 7942.679
technology available makes no damn sense

7940.28 --> 7944.44
like everybody knows that now even

7942.679 --> 7946.4800000000005
people that believe in space they

7944.44 --> 7948.44
realize like yeah that's that's really

7946.48 --> 7952.36
ridiculous it's

7948.44 --> 7954.96
unlikely potentially fake like why are

7952.36 --> 7958.839999999999
they making that same

7954.96 --> 7961.679
level of mistake now with this new [ __ ]

7958.84 --> 7964.679
I don't

7961.679 --> 7964.679
understand

7967.04 --> 7973.119
why yeah had an Nixon phone

7970.119 --> 7973.119
calls

7973.57 --> 7976.66
[Music]

7978.559 --> 7982.4800000000005
I just don't get it like

7983.239 --> 7988.159
why why do you have to make it so

7988.32 --> 7993.759999999999
ridiculous can't you just continue with

7991.679 --> 7996.96
space science fiction

7993.76 --> 8001.2390000000005
story of the state that is

7996.96 --> 8003.88
just a little bit more realistic seeming

8001.239 --> 8008.678999999999
just just a little bit can we just have

8003.88 --> 8010.32
a little tiny tiny bit of apparent

8008.679 --> 8015.0
realism

8010.32 --> 8015.0
please why does it have to be so

8030.04 --> 8033.04
ridiculous

8043.4 --> 8048.44
right anyway who's still

8053.4 --> 8060.159
watching got six uplo that's

8057.48 --> 8061.678999999999
great hope anybody's still interested

8060.159 --> 8064.759999999999
I'm I'm ready to continue the

8061.679 --> 8068.679
conversation I've been going for 2 hours

8064.76 --> 8068.679
and roughly 15

8090.04 --> 8093.04
minutes

8099.159 --> 8103.92
I we we discussed a lot in this show

8106.679 --> 8113.04
so started out with

8109.599 --> 8114.8
dreams then this ridiculous claim I had

8113.04 --> 8118.44
to ban this

8114.8 --> 8122.0
guy I mean you you don't just claim that

8118.44 --> 8125.28
you filmed the docking

8122.0 --> 8128.239
or that you witnessed the docking of

8125.28 --> 8131.159
some module on an ISS directly through a

8128.239 --> 8135.159
telescope and you didn't film it when

8131.159 --> 8139.199
nobody's has ever claimed to have seen

8135.159 --> 8142.719
that right even if jiren did supposedly

8139.199 --> 8144.96
see the ISS through his p900 Transit the

8142.719 --> 8148.559
moon yeah that's weird enough but I mean

8144.96 --> 8152.0
that's just the sighting of the alleged

8148.559 --> 8154.320000000001
ISS whatever the hell that is

8152.0 --> 8156.44
that's one thing but to actually see a

8154.32 --> 8158.199
physical interaction as it supposedly

8156.44 --> 8161.119
happened nobody's ever even claimed to

8158.199 --> 8163.119
have seen that from the ground ever so

8161.119 --> 8165.32
that was ridiculous had to kick him out

8163.119 --> 8167.04
like some point it just stops like I'm

8165.32 --> 8169.84
not going to

8167.04 --> 8173.079
accept that kind of lying in my chat

8169.84 --> 8175.0
like even or wble a baller agreed that

8173.079 --> 8178.48
it was lying

8175.0 --> 8181.04
so then we moved on to like yeah what is

8178.48 --> 8182.558999999999
the dimensions what are the dimensions

8181.04 --> 8185.559
of the Flat

8182.559 --> 8188.719
Earth how does it work out and like a

8185.559 --> 8191.08
barrier right how would that be what

8188.719 --> 8196.359
can't it be definitely either has to be

8191.08 --> 8198.8
solid or my conception of non-space no

8196.359 --> 8199.679
more volume available for material to

8198.8 --> 8203.319
exist

8199.679 --> 8205.479
in that could be the potential

8203.319 --> 8207.399
barrier it would definitely be

8205.479 --> 8208.599
unbreakable because there's literally

8207.399 --> 8211.0
nothing to

8208.599 --> 8213.12
break because there's no material that

8211.0 --> 8215.76
can move in it it's just like this is

8213.12 --> 8218.160000000002
where it ends where material can move

8215.76 --> 8220.439
that would be nons space then we moved

8218.16 --> 8220.439
on

8227.599 --> 8235.639000000001
to how would you potentially do an

8232.519 --> 8238.16
expedition into the Antarctic or Arctic

8235.639 --> 8243.759999999998
through extremely cold circumstances and

8238.16 --> 8246.679
had a crazy idea of a UR ium plated

8243.76 --> 8249.16
submarine to basically just melt

8246.679 --> 8252.24
straight through giant ice

8249.16 --> 8254.88
wall which is a crazy idea but I mean if

8252.24 --> 8258.0
you had to do it that would probably be

8254.88 --> 8261.598999999998
the way just a permanently giant hot

8258.0 --> 8261.599
element and just going through

8263.399 --> 8268.599
it right and then even then at some

8265.96 --> 8271.08
point you just go and then it's

8268.599 --> 8273.399
just like yeah you're not going going

8271.08 --> 8276.479
further

8273.399 --> 8279.8
like there would be either unmeltable

8276.479 --> 8282.358999999999
ice or non-space or another physical

8279.8 --> 8284.119999999999
barrier that doesn't melt so it still

8282.359 --> 8286.599
wouldn't mean that you just like go

8284.12 --> 8286.599
through it

8287.08 --> 8294.039999999999
all and then we moved on to the supposed

8291.88 --> 8296.358999999999
claim of Russia and China building a

8294.04 --> 8298.599
nuclear power plant on the moon and just

8296.359 --> 8302.319
how incredibly

8298.599 --> 8308.04
convoluted all these

8302.319 --> 8308.039999999999
Space Project claims have become it's

8310.459 --> 8313.799
[Music]

8317.92 --> 8322.04
tiresome right so anyway I hope

8320.359 --> 8323.2
everybody that has been watching and

8322.04 --> 8327.080000000002
that might

8323.2 --> 8327.08
watch has enjoyed

8327.8 --> 8332.719
it what's

8329.719 --> 8332.719
that

8335.88 --> 8338.479
oh more

8339.319 --> 8342.319
biology

8347.08 --> 8351.559
okay yeah I may check that out but I

8349.439 --> 8353.399
mean it's not really the subject we're

8351.559 --> 8356.96
talking about right

8353.399 --> 8359.719
now it's just equal does that count as a

8356.96 --> 8362.719
citation maybe it depends on

8359.719 --> 8362.719
what

8368.439 --> 8373.559000000001
right where is everybody I mean I don't

8371.599 --> 8376.24
mind just talking to you but where the

8373.559 --> 8377.96
hell is everybody seeing star water

8376.24 --> 8379.319
where did you go Woodwork and guny bear

8377.96 --> 8382.719
where did you

8379.319 --> 8382.719
go Nathan

8383.84 --> 8392.64
R debatable D orble where did you all

8389.64 --> 8392.64
go

8394.81 --> 8397.939999999999
[Music]

8407.72 --> 8411.8
made oatmeal back now oh okay welcome

8419.64 --> 8422.64
back

8427.72 --> 8431.88
right so anyway Today's Show definitely

8429.96 --> 8433.56
better than yesterday yesterday I was

8431.88 --> 8435.88
freaking

8433.56 --> 8440.84
miserable

8435.88 --> 8444.759999999998
just just felt bad today I feel much

8440.84 --> 8448.72
better even though I had really weird

8444.76 --> 8449.64
dreams like dreams that I haven't had in

8448.72 --> 8451.358999999999
in

8449.64 --> 8453.88
decades

8451.359 --> 8455.92
repeating like childhood dreams but not

8453.88 --> 8461.319
just remembering them but like actually

8455.92 --> 8464.64
repeating them very strange very very

8461.319 --> 8468.0
strange but it didn't make me feel

8464.64 --> 8470.08
miserable or nostalgic or anything I did

8468.0 --> 8471.92
get out of it yesterday with that dream

8470.08 --> 8475.12
I didn't get out of it it was just like

8471.92 --> 8475.12
it tainted my entire

8479.56 --> 8482.56
day

8496.439 --> 8503.359
right so I will uh attempt to keep going

8500.399 --> 8505.64
with my show there might be another off

8503.359 --> 8507.880000000001
day like yesterday I mean it's not the

8505.64 --> 8509.439
first time that's happened right I mean

8507.88 --> 8511.24
it's not the first time I said like I'm

8509.439 --> 8513.16
not going to come back

8511.24 --> 8516.119999999999
because I was just so incredibly

8513.16 --> 8516.119999999999
miserable over

8516.56 --> 8520.68
something but I mean the actual

8518.72 --> 8524.319
likelihood of like really going to go

8520.68 --> 8526.359
away is very little because I really

8524.319 --> 8529.88
despite everything and the miserable

8526.359 --> 8531.399000000001
moments love doing this show I love

8529.88 --> 8533.438999999998
talking about these things I love

8531.399 --> 8534.76
talking about about things with people

8533.439 --> 8537.2
that are

8534.76 --> 8539.52
open-minded I love to help them get

8537.2 --> 8542.52
their thoughts straight and correct

8539.52 --> 8542.52
them

8543.16 --> 8549.24
in a positive way and I hope that they

8545.319 --> 8554.68
appreciate it like like had with Nathan

8549.24 --> 8554.68
AR like I don't mind if you're making

8555.2 --> 8561.08
mistakes like I made those mistakes like

8558.6 --> 8563.800000000001
years ago I made those mistakes I didn't

8561.08 --> 8565.88
really understand how it worked so like

8563.8 --> 8569.56
don't worry about

8565.88 --> 8571.519999999999
it it's actually an opportunity if you

8569.56 --> 8574.08
say something that's incorrect in my

8571.52 --> 8577.0
chat but you didn't mean to like troll

8574.08 --> 8581.2
or anything it's for me an opportunity

8577.0 --> 8583.399
to show my skill and an explanation art

8581.2 --> 8586.08
of how it works and what my

8583.399 --> 8588.56
understanding is it will hopefully help

8586.08 --> 8590.6
you will echo on and if not to the

8588.56 --> 8593.84
individual then to the

8590.6 --> 8596.56
Watcher and maybe motivate you to

8593.84 --> 8600.16
consider getting involved

8596.56 --> 8602.519999999999
too because I'm always looking for new

8600.16 --> 8604.76
watch that are willing to participate in

8602.52 --> 8604.76
the

8606.12 --> 8612.92
chat and basically join

8609.64 --> 8615.84
up so we could have a chat with people

8612.92 --> 8615.84
that are smart

8616.16 --> 8622.279
intelligent have a level of spiritual

8620.12 --> 8625.84
sense I mean you don't have to be like

8622.279 --> 8628.359
the hyp spiritual person but I mean it's

8625.84 --> 8631.6
going to be very useful if you have some

8628.359 --> 8634.399000000001
sensibility in it because it's a regular

8631.6 --> 8636.08
re reoccurring subject I talk about

8634.399 --> 8639.319
spirituality

8636.08 --> 8643.52
too right especially now that I've

8639.319 --> 8643.519999999999
basically learned to apply the

8644.359 --> 8648.92
technique and that's I'm going to apply

8646.84 --> 8651.68
that more often especially if anybody

8648.92 --> 8653.359
here is in need of it if you're like man

8651.68 --> 8656.12
everything's going to is going wrong

8653.359 --> 8659.720000000001
today and I or I got in an accident and

8656.12 --> 8664.12
I feel like out of it you feel like that

8659.72 --> 8667.24
you tell me then if I get the calling I

8664.12 --> 8668.6
will just apply the technique despite

8667.24 --> 8671.279
all the trolls

8668.6 --> 8673.359
going my crazy Devil's over like go it's

8671.279 --> 8676.2
so fake it's so fake it's a scammer it's

8673.359 --> 8679.08
a scammer he's such a scammer that just

8676.2 --> 8682.240000000002
does a healing prayer for absolutely

8679.08 --> 8684.72
free never ever expecting any kind of

8682.24 --> 8687.72
funds in return it's such a

8684.72 --> 8691.399
scam I'm such a scammer for applying a

8687.72 --> 8693.278999999999
technique for absolutely free aren't I a

8691.399 --> 8696.92
scammer seeking star water isn't that

8693.279 --> 8701.640000000001
just like so

8696.92 --> 8705.56
evil that I I offer to like help people

8701.64 --> 8707.88
heal for free I mean oh my God I need to

8705.56 --> 8710.64
be taken down because I'm a scammer I

8707.88 --> 8711.96
just help people at a distance for

8710.64 --> 8715.68
absolutely

8711.96 --> 8718.479
nothing it's just such a scam don't you

8715.68 --> 8718.479000000001
think so seeking

8719.319 --> 8724.399
starwater

8721.76 --> 8728.279
like they actually call me a scammer for

8724.399 --> 8730.88
that it's like do they understand what a

8728.279 --> 8730.880000000001
scam

8733.08 --> 8737.359
is people think of me as their problem

8735.64 --> 8740.88
yeah it is but it

8737.359 --> 8744.16
just it really makes me wonder like do

8740.88 --> 8748.679999999998
they understand the meaning of

8744.16 --> 8753.16
words like do they know what a scam

8748.68 --> 8756.16
is like a scam is like you do

8753.16 --> 8759.119999999999
something that is potentially an

8756.16 --> 8761.439
illusion or false in the hopes of

8759.12 --> 8763.319000000001
getting something out of

8761.439 --> 8768.56
it

8763.319 --> 8771.479
right money Fame loyalty

8768.56 --> 8774.8
something and you're using an illusion

8771.479 --> 8777.199999999999
for it what the hell do I get out of

8774.8 --> 8779.92

8801.68 --> 8806.56
spirit why am I even responding to that

8804.72 --> 8809.519999999999
