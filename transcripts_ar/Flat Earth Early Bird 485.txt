be much appreciated

71.16 --> 75.27
and yeah

76.65 --> 82.78
today the weather yeah it's kind of the

79.66 --> 83.82
same as yesterday it's just really

82.78 --> 85.649
amazing

83.82 --> 89.83
beautiful

85.649 --> 92.8
not a single cloud in sight anywhere

89.83 --> 95.89
it's yeah it's pretty incredible and

92.8 --> 98.28
there are some planes flying here and

95.89 --> 100.24
there I saw one flying over earlier and

98.28 --> 103.119
there's one over there I don't know if

100.24 --> 104.33999999999999
you can see that but they're not leaving

103.119 --> 107.05
chemtrails

104.34 --> 111.399
just little contrails that immediately

107.05 --> 113.349
dissipate it is also very windy and the

111.399 --> 117.09
wind is kind of fresh but at the same

113.349 --> 119.88000000000001
time when wind wind goes down

117.09 --> 123.22
then if you can hear that

119.88 --> 126.67
it's yeah I have trouble like keeping

123.22 --> 128.679
the door in the same position because

126.67 --> 130.569
with these wind gusts they it suddenly

128.679 --> 134.08
likes to Ram itself open and all that

130.569 --> 136.72
kind of annoying but yeah the Sun is

134.08 --> 140.38000000000002
really nice and bright so must be a

136.72 --> 143.26
great to dare be in one of these houses

140.38 --> 147.31
over there facing the Sun now behind the

143.26 --> 150.14999999999998
window because that must be really nice

147.31 --> 154.95
and warm anyway oh

150.15 --> 159.989
yeah apparently church is still closed

154.95 --> 159.98899999999998
so they all got to corona fear

162.4 --> 165.56900000000002
pretty sure of it

168.599 --> 177.69
so yeah good morning I

171.599 --> 180.98899999999998
got green tea with me and a strawberry

177.69 --> 180.989
last one

184.5 --> 191.04
okay good servant

187.65 --> 191.04

197.14 --> 203.82999999999998

201.18 --> 206.86
anyway let's see who's in chat a good

203.83 --> 210.06
servant was first Amanda you turn up

206.86 --> 212.22000000000003
tell Robin Stanley

210.06 --> 216.48
Jeffery bill

212.22 --> 220.209
yeah good to see you all I guess people

216.48 --> 222.76
had a pretty late night I actually did

220.209 --> 224.82
not have that late a night I went to bed

222.76 --> 228.6
before the Sun came up ray

224.82 --> 231.959
but it's a good call my part because

228.6 --> 236.37
yeah sleep was good and it

231.959 --> 236.37
was very sunny in the morning

239.1 --> 245.07
so okay nineteen watching so yeah

242.769 --> 245.07
yesterday

246.72 --> 251.23
[Music]

248.61 --> 254.35000000000002
Owen Benjamin streams really early

251.23 --> 257.049
yesterday that was kind of nice

254.35 --> 259.32
and I was there like I caught it

257.049 --> 262.9
immediately I was kind of lucky

259.32 --> 265.5
usually when he goes live I I only find

262.9 --> 267.87
out as I'm like flicking around

265.5 --> 271.15
but I got there in time

267.87 --> 275.88
yeah after that I went around on this

271.15 --> 280.17999999999995
guard lil and I was weird man I I

275.88 --> 283.229
seem to be or well I got into discord

280.18 --> 286.99
and I noticed that I was still

283.229 --> 289.0
connected to Jose's room as well that he

286.99 --> 292.6
didn't have a live show but I still went

289.0 --> 294.52
in there for a few and it was just so

292.6 --> 297.16
typical you know I got in there and it

294.52 --> 301.79999999999995
was like they were all suddenly want to

297.16 --> 306.45000000000005
ask me all these heavy questions

301.8 --> 309.81
got all personal like ask me the good

306.45 --> 312.229
mkultra like oh really

309.81 --> 315.81
but

312.229 --> 318.449
yeah that was that was kind of

315.81 --> 321.21
interesting nobody recorded supposedly

318.449 --> 327.09000000000003
and then eventually Q was there as well

321.21 --> 328.85999999999996
channel Q and she did record then she

327.09 --> 331.59
just said yeah I'm not gonna use it but

328.86 --> 333.599
then after a while we got into some flat

331.59 --> 335.75899999999996
earth technicals and I basically put

333.599 --> 338.37
down or tried to put down because I

335.759 --> 340.40000000000003
could constantly rhombus so I had to go

338.37 --> 343.55
in kind of a Nathan mode I

340.4 --> 346.43899999999996
was putting down yeah you have no proof

343.55 --> 348.65000000000003
any of the heavenly bodies are physical

346.439 --> 351.449
in any way and

348.65 --> 352.71
she's like oh what is your proof of what

351.449 --> 355.11
you proof are when that their

352.71 --> 357.79999999999995
holographic a hologram and light are

355.11 --> 362.34000000000003
physical too

357.8 --> 365.15000000000003
so annoying so eventually just got out

362.34 --> 369.15
of there but yeah she she just kept on

365.15 --> 371.339
or basically trying to bully me and I

369.15 --> 373.289
don't like when actual women do that you

371.339 --> 375.529
know when Brenda does it doesn't work

373.289 --> 378.3
because she's not actually a woman

375.529 --> 382.37
and when a woman does that I get really

378.3 --> 384.99
pissed off it's like no

382.37 --> 388.289
so I started to call her a [ __ ] and all

384.99 --> 390.899
that and now I wonder if she's like all

388.289 --> 392.55
pissy and gonna use the material I

390.899 --> 395.25
should have known it like as soon as I

392.55 --> 397.789
saw she was in the room I knew like that

395.25 --> 402.21
woman is not reliable

397.789 --> 404.49
but maybe maybe she will be she did kind

402.21 --> 405.13899999999995
of like promise to me she wouldn't use

404.49 --> 407.909
it

405.139 --> 410.31
but a tendon shouting match I don't know

407.909 --> 413.449
man I just I'm gonna be careful going

410.31 --> 415.469
there again because

413.449 --> 417.779
even though they have interesting

415.469 --> 420.99
questions I just can't really trust them

417.779 --> 425.71
you know it's

420.99 --> 427.169
her voice is nice it is nice when she's

425.71 --> 429.539
not being all [ __ ]

427.169 --> 432.96
good servant

429.539 --> 437.669
is she good-looking I don't know

432.96 --> 437.669
her icon looks kind of okay

443.46 --> 450.06
doesn't really matter anyway but yeah

446.59 --> 450.06
yeah that happened

454.199 --> 461.759
yeah yeah okay sure I look I don't

458.289 --> 464.83
really care I don't really care you know

461.759 --> 467.71000000000004
technically anybody on the Internet can

464.83 --> 469.65
be anybody to me I just go by the data I

467.71 --> 472.62899999999996
have which is their voices and their

469.65 --> 476.289
code of conduct and just their character

472.629 --> 478.139
that's all it is to me until there's

476.289 --> 481.27
actually

478.139 --> 483.52
some serious sign that I'm gonna meet

481.27 --> 486.19
people and then it becomes another game

483.52 --> 488.94899999999996
just like the Amsterdam conference you

486.19 --> 491.68
know before that point they were all

488.949 --> 493.87
just internet people to me sounds kind

491.68 --> 496.27
of crude but I have to be real like that

493.87 --> 500.05
because I fell for that kind of thing

496.27 --> 503.639
ten years ago and I had like internet

500.05 --> 507.069
girlfriends you know and they

503.639 --> 509.319
yeah turn out to be liars and yeah once

507.069 --> 510.719
you got caught on that once you start to

509.319 --> 513.099
believe

510.719 --> 515.949
even if you find out there's like little

513.099 --> 517.659
lies afterward it's it starts pulling at

515.949 --> 520.3
you're really bad it's super annoying

517.659 --> 522.909
now I didn't completely make an ass of

520.3 --> 524.9799999999999
myself but I got caught on her for a

522.909 --> 526.959
long time like I even talked to friends

524.98 --> 528.4300000000001
about her for like a year it was super

526.959 --> 530.89
annoying it turned out to be some

528.43 --> 533.4699999999999
fifteen-year-old girl that was not

530.89 --> 534.779
pretty at all using pictures of somebody

533.47 --> 538.3000000000001
else

534.779 --> 540.1
good evening find the person who that

538.3 --> 542.5
was and all that it was somebody

540.1 --> 544.779
completely different with a boyfriend

542.5 --> 548.23
and a totally different axe and another

544.779 --> 552.04
so yeah that that sense that since that

548.23 --> 554.52
really got through to me I just see it

552.04 --> 557.43
as in turn at people and until I'm

554.52 --> 560.25
actually gonna meet them in person for

557.43 --> 562.7399999999999
sure I'm not gonna care too much because

560.25 --> 564.63
I can't allow that to happen otherwise

562.74 --> 566.36
I'm afraid I'm gonna be pulled into

564.63 --> 569.66
nonsense again

566.36 --> 569.66
no oh

569.72 --> 575.9
wait at a meeting I'm not showing up in

572.279 --> 575.9
your YouTube lists that's weird

580.45 --> 582.48
oh

584.07 --> 588.9300000000001
yeah and by the way that 15 year old

586.66 --> 594.81
girl it was kind of funny though because

588.93 --> 594.81
I did actually talk to her parents

596.1 --> 600.37
cuz

597.66 --> 602.35
she was kind of like a bit of a

600.37 --> 605.94
pathological liar sort of you know

602.35 --> 608.1700000000001
fifteen-year-old troublesome and

605.94 --> 610.0290000000001
she didn't live in a family that was

608.17 --> 611.9799999999999
doing too bad so it just seemed like she

610.029 --> 614.019
was doing all that because she was bored

611.98 --> 617.139
and just trying to fantasize like she

614.019 --> 619.839
was this glorious rich gothic girl with

617.139 --> 621.519
an expensive car and all that and I've

619.839 --> 622.2600000000001
totally fell for it I was a complete

621.519 --> 624.99
dumbass

622.26 --> 627.61
[Laughter]

624.99 --> 629.85
and then I sort of met the real thing

627.61 --> 632.01
and then it was a dumbass again but in

629.85 --> 634.0790000000001
in the real world

632.01 --> 636.5699999999999
that was my ex

634.079 --> 640.149
but

636.57 --> 641.9200000000001
yeah eventually I kind of figured out

640.149 --> 643.42
that she was lying and I kind of

641.92 --> 646.06
confronted with her because I also

643.42 --> 647.9799999999999
talked to her over the phone I got a

646.06 --> 650.079
phone number and then I kind of

647.98 --> 651.85
convinced it like yeah this is not good

650.079 --> 654.899
this is not good for you I kind of like

651.85 --> 658.1800000000001
figured out the wait she really is a

654.899 --> 660.97
younger girl and you know she's probably

658.18 --> 664.1099999999999
just lonely and I now got into parent

660.97 --> 664.11
mode and just said like yeah

664.29 --> 670.48
you need to

667.47 --> 672.12
stop this and all that and I talked to

670.48 --> 676.57
her parents that were there

672.12 --> 679.24
and they attested to like yeah the

676.57 --> 681.61
behavior and yeah she does seem to call

679.24 --> 684.79
up strange men and then pretend to be

681.61 --> 687.36
listen that and this is I don't know I

684.79 --> 690.9699999999999
did learn a lot from the experience

687.36 --> 693.1
and they rounded it up well anyway that

690.97 --> 694.529
was a long time ago not gonna happen to

693.1 --> 696.0400000000001
me again

694.529 --> 700.8
yeah

696.04 --> 703.8
and I've never even seen her real

700.8 --> 703.8
picture

703.92 --> 708.0699999999999
maybe I think she showed it one time

706.329 --> 711.0
eventually she kind of sneaked it in

708.07 --> 711.0
between other photos

711.899 --> 715.11
anyway uh

715.86 --> 722.37
we call that catfish yep yeah that

719.05 --> 722.37
that's sort of what that was

725.67 --> 729.42
how old was I

731.399 --> 738.0
think it was like

733.889 --> 738.0
26 27 then

740.37 --> 743.549
[Music]

768.74 --> 774.32
oh you have sleeping water yeah the

771.62 --> 775.75
ballers are at it again and to keep on

774.32 --> 779.9300000000001
going aren't they

775.75 --> 784.3
it's just like street hecklers they come

779.93 --> 787.1899999999999
back every day try to screw around again

784.3 --> 788.78
it doesn't matter how badly they get you

787.19 --> 792.5200000000001
ill eiated how badly they get caught

788.78 --> 797.05
lying they just come back every day just

792.52 --> 797.05
because that's what they do desist

809.16 --> 815.1899999999999
yeah you know the ballers it is kind of

811.74 --> 819.17
fascinating but yeah what you're doing

815.19 --> 821.73
sleeping warrior Tony yeah constantly

819.17 --> 824.24
digging on to them and just exposing

821.73 --> 827.27
them I can't really do that

824.24 --> 830.25
it's it's

827.27 --> 833.4
just they're too low down you know I

830.25 --> 835.19
don't wanna I'm up here like thinking

833.4 --> 838.14
about a lot of

835.19 --> 842.4300000000001
much more rewarding things to think

838.14 --> 844.92
about and they they don't it is kind of

842.43 --> 848.3399999999999
interesting to study it like under a

844.92 --> 851.0699999999999
loop in a way and to be in the flat

848.34 --> 852.84
earth debates while that transpires but

851.07 --> 855.2700000000001
yeah you may have noticed that I'm not

852.84 --> 856.1600000000001
really the one that's gonna super hard

855.27 --> 860.43
hammer

856.16 --> 863.8199999999999
people you know I don't like doing that

860.43 --> 867.15
I only do that when they pull out like

863.82 --> 870.09
really disgusting behavior when I'm like

867.15 --> 872.25
in a good wave when they literally start

870.09 --> 874.5600000000001
throwing in the poison just like that

872.25 --> 877.23
know when that happens with Nathan

874.56 --> 879.38
Nathan is kind of so ruthless that he

877.23 --> 881.6700000000001
just doesn't care he just starts clawing

879.38 --> 883.02
doesn't care whether the well is

881.67 --> 885.03
poisoned or not because he knows

883.02 --> 886.92
eventually they will do it and they

885.03 --> 889.11
always do that's the funny thing but he

886.92 --> 890.67
just doesn't care anymore I do care

889.11 --> 893.73
because it's all about the principle

890.67 --> 896.76
it's all about showing and consequence

893.73 --> 899.79
is a consequent response and holding

896.76 --> 901.86
steadfast with that those principles

899.79 --> 903.54
that's what I'm trying to accomplish is

901.86 --> 905.49
for me it's much more about showing

903.54 --> 907.65
behavior and learning from it and all

905.49 --> 910.79
that Nathan's just like there for the

907.65 --> 913.14
witness just it's just ruthless

910.79 --> 914.8199999999999
and you know when you do that every day

913.14 --> 917.97
and when you focus so much on the

914.82 --> 921.0300000000001
details like that yeah it's easy to

917.97 --> 924.0
catch cat get caught up into a

921.03 --> 926.01
ruthlessness because it is so much of

924.0 --> 928.74
the same nonsense like even if you would

926.01 --> 931.41
try to start out really civil it's gonna

928.74 --> 934.32
degrade anyway and I because I avoid

931.41 --> 937.12
that partially I don't get dragged down

934.32 --> 940.749
as much and I can afford to

937.12 --> 943.17
have more on the level conversations

940.749 --> 948.5690000000001
even with ballers

943.17 --> 953.2299999999999
no no Major Tom nathan is not vile

948.569 --> 955.4799999999999
he gets a little vial you know when he

953.23 --> 957.639
gets pretty ruthless and all that and

955.48 --> 959.5500000000001
then baller double down and double down

957.639 --> 962.79
again and get all

959.55 --> 966.459
that annoying just

962.79 --> 968.17
defeated yet bullying back type of

966.459 --> 970.42
attitude yeah then he gets pretty

968.17 --> 971.8
disgusting but I get the same way that's

970.42 --> 974.8
kind of what happened to me yesterday

971.8 --> 977.529
when I was talking to Q she was just rum

974.8 --> 979.689
pissing me and I tried to really crack

977.529 --> 983.949
her down on the situation and on my

979.689 --> 986.079
argument that I wasn't like my evidence

983.949 --> 987.93
for the Sun and the moon and all of it

986.079 --> 991.149
being holographic is

987.93 --> 993.6389999999999
that there is no evidence no evidence

991.149 --> 996.189
for a physical nature and therefore a

993.639 --> 998.74
specific proximity and angular size

996.189 --> 1000.829
change and all that and she just refused

998.74 --> 1004.17
to listen and started to

1000.829 --> 1007.2489999999999
yes embarrass me for my lack of evidence

1004.17 --> 1011.0889999999999
of a holographic nature and that

1007.249 --> 1014.399
that a hologram is physical to is just

1011.089 --> 1017.5500000000001
try to even explain like no no it's not

1014.399 --> 1019.259
physical what you see the hologram the

1017.55 --> 1021.3599999999999
thing that you see is not physical it's

1019.259 --> 1023.519
not really there should you approach it

1021.36 --> 1026.339
it'll disappear you can't grab it it's

1023.519 --> 1029.429
not physical it's not really there it's

1026.339 --> 1032.779
just light that is rearranged in a

1029.429 --> 1036.689
certain way in order for you to

1032.779 --> 1039.0
seem very much like a physical object

1036.689 --> 1041.159
that's the hologram it's not physical

1039.0 --> 1043.439
it's not really there it just appears to

1041.159 --> 1046.38
be there from a certain angle because of

1043.439 --> 1047.8400000000001
light workings and she refused to hear

1046.38 --> 1051.1100000000001
it she just

1047.84 --> 1053.9399999999998
ROM pissed right over it and

1051.11 --> 1055.9189999999999
started to make fun of me for my lack of

1053.94 --> 1058.6490000000001
evidence that their holographic and that

1055.919 --> 1061.46
light and Holograms are physical - it

1058.649 --> 1061.4599999999998
was super annoying

1061.52 --> 1065.69
so yeah that kind of thing happens to me

1064.26 --> 1068.1
as well

1065.69 --> 1069.5700000000002
but it's really all about the double

1068.1 --> 1072.4399999999998
downing you know about the Double Down

1069.57 --> 1072.4399999999998
syndrome that they do

1073.789 --> 1077.539
yeah channel cue

1081.47 --> 1084.589
[Music]

1096.49 --> 1101.83
major Tom you're kind of

1102.519 --> 1106.0
pushing it here

1120.22 --> 1128.32
yep make 13 fe right on target

1125.49 --> 1131.909
so you think she's cool why don't think

1128.32 --> 1131.9089999999999
she's cool I think she's kind of nasty

1136.92 --> 1143.64
it's like yes she has

1140.3 --> 1147.33
qualities but socially she's just a

1143.64 --> 1149.99
pecking order [ __ ] really and it's

1147.33 --> 1149.99
super annoying

1156.35 --> 1159.55
[Music]

1162.87 --> 1169.339
[Music]

1183.36 --> 1189.56
yeah indeed amenda you that's that's

1186.75 --> 1192.54
indeed true

1189.56 --> 1194.8999999999999
but yeah you know the ballers do it

1192.54 --> 1194.8999999999999
anyway

1194.93 --> 1201.69
that's the problem with religion

1198.23 --> 1204.57
you start to do things you know kind of

1201.69 --> 1206.49
aren't good for you anyway because you

1204.57 --> 1208.23
need to hold on so it's like what are

1206.49 --> 1210.11
you gonna sacrifice for your beliefs

1208.23 --> 1212.03
well

1210.11 --> 1215.57
they're

1212.03 --> 1218.87
they're conscious they're good conscious

1215.57 --> 1221.21
they're there's a lot of sleep and

1218.87 --> 1222.7399999999998
a lot of

1221.21 --> 1224.69
antihistamine

1222.74 --> 1229.17
agitation

1224.69 --> 1230.93
so that's that's their sacrifice to hold

1229.17 --> 1234.44
on to their beliefs and

1230.93 --> 1238.25
yeah I wouldn't do that

1234.44 --> 1238.25
it's a terrible way to go

1249.99 --> 1254.6200000000001
Cleary please just spell out the full

1253.06 --> 1258.1499999999999
name because there's other people in

1254.62 --> 1258.1499999999999
this chat too that are called Tom

1259.65 --> 1266.3500000000001
yeah okay Major Tom well that coming

1264.52 --> 1271.32
from you doesn't mean much to me because

1266.35 --> 1271.32
I'm pretty sure you're gay so

1274.8 --> 1281.6699999999998
could be wrong though you could just be

1277.98 --> 1284.53
gay sorry no I'm not wrong

1281.67 --> 1288.0
okay maybe not active what pumper I

1284.53 --> 1288.0
don't know but you're pretty damn gay

1297.16 --> 1305.19
[Music]

1302.159 --> 1308.98
but that's alright oh

1305.19 --> 1311.429
you're not okay I'll stop behaving so

1308.98 --> 1311.429
Gaiden

1316.649 --> 1321.6589999999999
don't maybe it's maybe you know maybe

1319.419 --> 1326.7990000000002
gays wrong it's just

1321.659 --> 1329.1390000000001
it's more gamma I guess it for me I'm

1326.799 --> 1332.019
used to originally just calling that gay

1329.139 --> 1335.9699999999998
and it kind of colloquial way before the

1332.019 --> 1338.44
social justice warrior word

1335.97 --> 1340.269
dictatorship started to rise I just

1338.44 --> 1343.799
called it gay and yeah I guess it's

1340.269 --> 1343.799
better described as just gamma

1344.07 --> 1355.62
and hey a lot of gammas are gay so

1348.659 --> 1355.6200000000001
or act gay yeah but that's all fine

1368.95 --> 1375.519
because smooth smoocher

1372.519 --> 1375.519
you

1375.879 --> 1381.649
not let's not go into descriptive gay

1379.249 --> 1384.6100000000001
things please that's not what I intended

1381.649 --> 1384.61
to on this Sunday

1391.64 --> 1395.5900000000001
[Music]

1392.889 --> 1399.1589999999999
it's I

1395.59 --> 1401.619
you know back to the Sunday thing it's

1399.159 --> 1404.5700000000002
I'm just kind of weirded out that

1401.619 --> 1407.1789999999999
nobody's coming to church that they

1404.57 --> 1409.309
closed that big it must be because of

1407.179 --> 1411.94
corona nonsense because that's the only

1409.309 --> 1414.769
reason they would do that

1411.94 --> 1417.2
consecutively and I'm just kind of

1414.769 --> 1419.72
disappointed and I'm because like hello

1417.2 --> 1422.559
your Christians right you're afraid of

1419.72 --> 1426.409
this virus thing really

1422.559 --> 1428.389
are they all fragile health they must

1426.409 --> 1430.429
not be taking good care of themselves in

1428.389 --> 1432.86
order to be even be that afraid I don't

1430.429 --> 1436.21
know although there there are quite a

1432.86 --> 1439.4289999999999
few old people there as well I

1436.21 --> 1442.3990000000001
guess from that perspective it will make

1439.429 --> 1444.529
a little bit more sense but still I just

1442.399 --> 1445.6899999999998
wonder like yeah now they don't have

1444.529 --> 1448.159
Church

1445.69 --> 1450.049
that's gonna be disappointing to a lot

1448.159 --> 1453.019
of them especially the younger ones you

1450.049 --> 1455.499
know because it was really a thing where

1453.019 --> 1460.34
you can meet a lot of other

1455.499 --> 1462.83
families and kids of all ages and be

1460.34 --> 1465.019
like it's evil that's the thing that I

1462.83 --> 1467.029
thought was really enjoyable about it

1465.019 --> 1468.3990000000001
going to church even though I don't have

1467.029 --> 1471.499
a family it's just

1468.399 --> 1474.1
such an a family atmosphere in different

1471.499 --> 1474.1000000000001
ages and

1476.84 --> 1484.4099999999999
and now they miss that

1480.26 --> 1489.29
and I just think like hmm couldn't they

1484.41 --> 1492.21
fix that another way or I don't know I

1489.29 --> 1494.25
don't even know for sure that what

1492.21 --> 1496.3500000000001
exactly they've done but yeah nobody

1494.25 --> 1499.07
seems to be coming this Sunday and last

1496.35 --> 1499.07
Sunday neither

1510.92 --> 1517.04
Wow Major Tom seems properly triggered

1513.86 --> 1519.9799999999998
now I don't know why man maybe it was me

1517.04 --> 1522.1
calling him gay maybe that brought up

1519.98 --> 1524.69
some bad memories

1522.1 --> 1526.85
you know if you're a gamma you're gonna

1524.69 --> 1529.27
be called gay a lot probably throughout

1526.85 --> 1529.27
your life

1532.69 --> 1539.6000000000001
yeah and by that standard I don't know I

1536.48 --> 1542.78
was kind of a pinup I had gamma traits

1539.6 --> 1545.78
as well when I was younger and I got

1542.78 --> 1548.1399999999999
called gay but I didn't really like act

1545.78 --> 1551.18
very gays just that

1548.14 --> 1554.48
some of my behavioural oddities were so

1551.18 --> 1556.13
out of place that I don't know some

1554.48 --> 1558.2
people thought it was kind of gay I

1556.13 --> 1560.3200000000002
wasn't it was to me it was more like no

1558.2 --> 1563.0
this is just my

1560.32 --> 1564.76
innocent child like popping forth and

1563.0 --> 1566.62
doing something really weird

1564.76 --> 1570.41
child

1566.62 --> 1573.83
like young like child spirit like but

1570.41 --> 1577.5700000000002
not childish it's just I don't know

1573.83 --> 1577.57
people just didn't don't get me

1578.8 --> 1585.9199999999998
can you imagine that I'm right now I'm

1581.72 --> 1588.13
so I'm very controlled now I'm much more

1585.92 --> 1591.77
matured much more control about myself

1588.13 --> 1595.7600000000002
so yeah even with all that there's still

1591.77 --> 1598.19
still weirdness and just yeah I guess

1595.76 --> 1601.51
unique ways of thinking that just pop up

1598.19 --> 1605.72
and all that and descriptions and

1601.51 --> 1607.79
that's that seems like wow that's so out

1605.72 --> 1610.01
there you know but it's really not that

1607.79 --> 1613.18
much it's so controlled to me because it

1610.01 --> 1616.03
used to be a lot more crazy

1613.18 --> 1619.3700000000001
but just doesn't work out

1616.03 --> 1620.44
chaos is not a good foundation to build

1619.37 --> 1623.51
upon

1620.44 --> 1626.0
because things break and swing around

1623.51 --> 1629.18
and then take sudden change it turn

1626.0 --> 1631.85
changes you planning becomes help when

1629.18 --> 1633.5800000000002
you're like that and that's why most of

1631.85 --> 1637.07
my life and yeah

1633.58 --> 1640.4299999999998
Society financially pretty messed up not

1637.07 --> 1642.08
super terrible but just didn't really

1640.43 --> 1646.01
get anywhere

1642.08 --> 1647.96
mm-hmm and I'm trying to change that and

1646.01 --> 1652.06
so I've been building a lot about myself

1647.96 --> 1656.3
and even using my youtube channel as

1652.06 --> 1658.79
kind of a dedication to double down on

1656.3 --> 1660.83
that personal project of trying to prove

1658.79 --> 1664.01
myself trying to see if I can figure way

1660.83 --> 1667.48
to keep being myself in a in a doable

1664.01 --> 1670.9
way progress and then somehow

1667.48 --> 1673.73
reconnect with society and

1670.9 --> 1676.15
I've chosen an odd place to start that

1673.73 --> 1678.25
in the flat or see now how odd is that

1676.15 --> 1681.5800000000002
you know

1678.25 --> 1684.32
but I don't know

1681.58 --> 1686.83
that's just how I do that I don't know

1684.32 --> 1686.83
why but

1686.92 --> 1694.8100000000002
even back in the day I would like start

1691.64 --> 1697.76
to build in like the most void place I

1694.81 --> 1700.51
would start to do something where nobody

1697.76 --> 1702.89
was it's just I

1700.51 --> 1704.93
don't know why that is maybe it's

1702.89 --> 1706.46
because I get more spiritual breathing

1704.93 --> 1708.6200000000001
room you know if you have a unique

1706.46 --> 1712.16
frequency just start building in

1708.62 --> 1714.11
something in an idea where it's really

1712.16 --> 1716.53
needed because nobody has that spirit

1714.11 --> 1719.81
then you have all this breathing room

1716.53 --> 1722.93
automatic respect because it's what

1719.81 --> 1725.51
people need and then that's yeah that

1722.93 --> 1727.6100000000001
works really well well if you're in

1725.51 --> 1729.23
between other people that are kind of

1727.61 --> 1731.54
doing the same thing then suddenly there

1729.23 --> 1733.07
comes competition in and the distortion

1731.54 --> 1735.46
of the flow and all that with each other

1733.07 --> 1738.35
pushing around I don't like that at all

1735.46 --> 1742.7
never like that I need a lot of calm

1738.35 --> 1745.01
space around me whether it be just not

1742.7 --> 1748.97
have been constantly swamped by a lot of

1745.01 --> 1751.97
people around me making noise or whether

1748.97 --> 1754.1000000000001
it is when I'm heavily focused that I

1751.97 --> 1758.41
don't get swarmed by people constantly

1754.1 --> 1760.73
trying to compete with me and at that

1758.41 --> 1763.73
yeah I don't really like equal

1760.73 --> 1764.54
competition naturally maybe that's like

1763.73 --> 1766.49
a

1764.54 --> 1770.03
hidden grab ler trade or something with

1766.49 --> 1772.76
I'd like to be on top of things be

1770.03 --> 1776.18
smarter because then I can just calm

1772.76 --> 1778.34
down don't worry so much and go more

1776.18 --> 1779.89
into like a parental mode and like how

1778.34 --> 1783.4599999999998
help everybody

1779.89 --> 1786.8600000000001
climb up it's something I used to do

1783.46 --> 1789.26
even when I went to school something you

1786.86 --> 1791.54
know after I was just preoccupied with

1789.26 --> 1793.7
my own weirdness and crazy experiences

1791.54 --> 1796.73
or I was obsessed with games and it just

1793.7 --> 1798.71
like [ __ ] around with magic cards

1796.73 --> 1801.3700000000001
like in the middle of class and like not

1798.71 --> 1807.3400000000001
paying attention at all but when it was

1801.37 --> 1810.82
then it's like hmm okay let's see what's

1807.34 --> 1813.5
going to

1810.82 --> 1816.86
be the hook-up what seems to be the

1813.5 --> 1818.9
problem here and then because when I was

1816.86 --> 1822.1999999999998
interested I would just figure things

1818.9 --> 1824.0300000000002
out so quickly it was crazy I would

1822.2 --> 1826.42
barely even have to read anything I

1824.03 --> 1830.84
don't know man maybe

1826.42 --> 1833.75
and then I would yeah and try to help

1830.84 --> 1835.6699999999998
out and I have an exact example of that

1833.75 --> 1837.53
and it was a math class a couple of

1835.67 --> 1839.63
times it happened in multiple schools

1837.53 --> 1841.79
where where there was math involved and

1839.63 --> 1843.5
that a math teacher was trying to

1841.79 --> 1845.57
explain something putting out a very

1843.5 --> 1848.54
elaborate formula there was all academic

1845.57 --> 1851.29
and yeah how funny is that in in

1848.54 --> 1854.87
retrospect that just turns out to be

1851.29 --> 1857.0
academic like presuppositional

1854.87 --> 1859.82
mechanical nonsense really and it just

1857.0 --> 1861.23
confused everybody didn't help at all so

1859.82 --> 1864.05
he added all that onto it like

1861.23 --> 1868.19
neurotically and then I was like okay I

1864.05 --> 1871.07
think that what people don't get is this

1868.19 --> 1873.53
and you're trying to explain that now if

1871.07 --> 1877.34
you do it like this and just leave that

1873.53 --> 1879.53
out then yeah see and everybody

1877.34 --> 1882.3799999999999
immediately in the class just starts to

1879.53 --> 1885.6499999999999
make no it's like oh yeah yeah that's

1882.38 --> 1888.5900000000001
exactly what we didn't get and that

1885.65 --> 1891.2800000000002
happened multiple times because I just

1888.59 --> 1891.28
got it

1892.58 --> 1900.98
like I can see when people don't get it

1896.19 --> 1900.98
and it can figure out why I don't know

1902.0 --> 1908.059
anyway yeah bragging about my

1906.35 --> 1911.6689999999999
my

1908.059 --> 1913.559
intelligence in the past whatever it's

1911.669 --> 1915.74
just something I like to I don't like to

1913.559 --> 1915.74
be

1915.89 --> 1923.0700000000002
well maybe I don't know even you know if

1919.52 --> 1925.53
everybody was like on the same level and

1923.07 --> 1929.9399999999998
had it was really responsible really

1925.53 --> 1931.35
good as pure as I try to be then well

1929.94 --> 1932.88
then there wouldn't be so much

1931.35 --> 1936.24
competition because everybody would

1932.88 --> 1939.0
realize that just who everybody else is

1936.24 --> 1941.669
and like how you have to be careful and

1939.0 --> 1945.99
maybe I've never been much used to that

1941.669 --> 1948.2700000000002
and instead just used to hang around in

1945.99 --> 1951.6
groups where I kind of was the smartest

1948.27 --> 1955.11
one and I would kind of lean on that be

1951.6 --> 1958.9499999999998
like like who I'm smarter so I can yeah

1955.11 --> 1961.11
you can do this or that even though yeah

1958.95 --> 1963.3600000000001
that how wrong was that did I turn out

1961.11 --> 1966.8999999999999
to be it was kind of a bluff back in the

1963.36 --> 1968.85
day because even though I was very quick

1966.9 --> 1973.3200000000002
at figuring things out I wasn't very

1968.85 --> 1976.549
wise with my social intuition at all see

1973.32 --> 1979.77
and then

1976.549 --> 1983.1299999999999
yeah then the Jesuit guy happened he's

1979.77 --> 1986.57
he spotted that he spotted that flaw and

1983.13 --> 1986.5700000000002
he used it abused it

2001.99 --> 2006.58
[Music]

2004.99 --> 2010.07
yeah

2006.58 --> 2011.87
and I guess because of all that it did

2010.07 --> 2013.57
also just show me like yeah it's not

2011.87 --> 2015.25
good to try to

2013.57 --> 2017.6899999999998
brag about

2015.25 --> 2018.52
outsmarting everybody because it's kind

2017.69 --> 2020.66
of dangerous

2018.52 --> 2024.32
there are some really fucked-up people

2020.66 --> 2026.8400000000001
out there that could that are like much

2024.32 --> 2028.85
worse and yet they don't like it when

2026.84 --> 2031.04
they think somebody else's can outsmart

2028.85 --> 2034.6899999999998
them makes them feel very nervous and

2031.04 --> 2039.56
then they start to do something about it

2034.69 --> 2042.14
so yeah I figured out okay I can't

2039.56 --> 2044.62
really stop being intelligent so the

2042.14 --> 2046.39
alternative is I

2044.62 --> 2051.14
have to

2046.39 --> 2053.11
what is it I have to show humility I

2051.14 --> 2057.669
have to

2053.11 --> 2061.6
stop being arrogant about it and

2057.669 --> 2064.7599999999998
be very careful I

2061.6 --> 2066.73
take the responsibility that comes with

2064.76 --> 2071.1690000000003
the awareness

2066.73 --> 2073.88
like beyond just practical and pragmatic

2071.169 --> 2075.8599999999997
solutions you know which what is what

2073.88 --> 2078.1600000000003
most people is like oh we got the edge

2075.86 --> 2081.23
okay we're just gonna exploit it

2078.16 --> 2082.94
what moral consequences you know if we

2081.23 --> 2085.31
don't do it somebody else does it that

2082.94 --> 2087.1
is what most people do and fortunately

2085.31 --> 2089.929
with that

2087.1 --> 2093.5
overlooking the responsibility they're

2089.929 --> 2097.2200000000003
giving the responsibility to the to the

2093.5 --> 2098.92
automatic financial system usually in a

2097.22 --> 2100.8999999999996
way

2098.92 --> 2104.27
and

2100.9 --> 2110.06
I try not to do that I try to keep it

2104.27 --> 2112.82
completely safe i guard it in my temple

2110.06 --> 2116.15
which is me my consciousness in my body

2112.82 --> 2119.0800000000004
and then guard it and I do show it and

2116.15 --> 2119.08
very careful

2123.619 --> 2126.849
all right anyway

2147.65 --> 2151.1800000000003
are you that's talking about

2165.94 --> 2170.94
right yeah John opto that's totally true

2169.119 --> 2175.2000000000003
because most people when they start

2170.94 --> 2178.48
bragging about their intelligence is

2175.2 --> 2180.1299999999997
it's like it's either their bragging

2178.48 --> 2181.95
about something that they really think

2180.13 --> 2184.96
they're intelligent enough

2181.95 --> 2187.0299999999997
but that actually kind of shows that Wow

2184.96 --> 2189.93
if they're so impressed with that then

2187.03 --> 2196.4700000000003
they're probably not that intelligent

2189.93 --> 2196.47
because yeah it's hard to explain

2201.75 --> 2206.07
when most people just try to show off

2204.36 --> 2208.32
with it it is kind of bragging it has

2206.07 --> 2214.55
more to do with that they just want and

2208.32 --> 2214.55
enthrall people socially impress them

2214.76 --> 2221.3700000000003
and you don't necessarily have to be

2218.76 --> 2223.7700000000004
smart for that you just have to know a

2221.37 --> 2226.4
couple of tricks that just make you look

2223.77 --> 2230.84
really smart

2226.4 --> 2230.84
that's what the majority of people do

2241.85 --> 2249.99
yeah Cleary just ignore a man he's just

2247.55 --> 2255.11
you know if he goes too far I'm gonna

2249.99 --> 2255.1099999999997
ban him or whatever again but he's

2255.8 --> 2258.8300000000004
you know

2265.869 --> 2270.279
low self-esteem leads to bragging at

2268.39 --> 2272.2889999999998
times right because it is the

2270.279 --> 2274.779
compensation you want to credit you want

2272.289 --> 2276.489
a glory from other people usually

2274.779 --> 2279.239
because you don't really feel great

2276.489 --> 2279.239
about yourself

2280.859 --> 2285.069
so you need to compensate that by

2283.089 --> 2286.749
attention from others to distract you

2285.069 --> 2289.479
from that you don't really feel good

2286.749 --> 2292.14
about yourself that's right that's a

2289.479 --> 2292.14
terrible habit

2304.21 --> 2309.18
okay you're in a timeout now stop being

2307.93 --> 2312.52
annoying

2309.18 --> 2315.5589999999997
stop poking people

2312.52 --> 2315.559
[Music]

2319.87 --> 2322.94
[Music]

2332.01 --> 2335.19
photogenic memory

2343.21 --> 2348.4
what does that mean you mean

2345.069 --> 2351.2799999999997
photographic memory or you can literally

2348.4 --> 2354.839
once you've seen something can't and

2351.28 --> 2354.8390000000004
remember the details and all that

2375.53 --> 2381.61
okay fine anyway let's take the

2380.45 --> 2385.27
opportunity

2381.61 --> 2390.07
to remind people that I'm still

2385.27 --> 2394.22
yeah trying to get a fresh air system

2390.07 --> 2396.9500000000003
this thing and yeah this morning when

2394.22 --> 2399.41
the Sun came through the window I was

2396.95 --> 2402.23
unpleasantly reminded how I don't have a

2399.41 --> 2405.0499999999997
working system right now because yeah

2402.23 --> 2408.1
the dust I could see it float in the Sun

2405.05 --> 2410.6800000000003
and don't like that

2408.1 --> 2415.93
so guys

2410.68 --> 2419.4199999999996
and yeah bigger players like dank and

2415.93 --> 2421.37
Samhain and everybody out there I'm Andy

2419.42 --> 2423.41
Young has been great support so far man

2421.37 --> 2426.1099999999997
she's she's been really supporting me

2423.41 --> 2428.8399999999997
big-time recently so I'm not gonna try

2426.11 --> 2432.08
to push you anymore but people out there

2428.84 --> 2435.5
please help me out financially it's you

2432.08 --> 2438.14
know I got I got enough right now to go

2435.5 --> 2442.58
around but it's not gonna get me the

2438.14 --> 2445.1
fresh air system like this so please can

2442.58 --> 2449.86
you guys just get together or something

2445.1 --> 2452.87
and see how to make this happen

2449.86 --> 2455.06
cuz yeah I really wanted and you know

2452.87 --> 2457.49
with everything that's going down in the

2455.06 --> 2460.75
world right now since this system is

2457.49 --> 2464.27
supposedly coming from America

2460.75 --> 2466.67
like the sooner the better because at

2464.27 --> 2468.77
some point just all everything may close

2466.67 --> 2472.81
down so I won't even be able to order it

2468.77 --> 2477.44
because oh can you guys please not

2472.81 --> 2479.47
let this roll on until mid-may please I

2477.44 --> 2482.38
beg of you

2479.47 --> 2487.0899999999997
let's get this together that's

2482.38 --> 2491.51
preferably before April April first

2487.09 --> 2493.7000000000003
so spread the word you know what I might

2491.51 --> 2495.3500000000004
do in our winneth on you I've been

2493.7 --> 2497.8999999999996
saying that for over a week now I should

2495.35 --> 2500.38
really do it it's just that evening I

2497.9 --> 2504.17
get so distracted by other things and

2500.38 --> 2507.86
yeah when once the Sun kind of goes down

2504.17 --> 2510.41
my energy levels just change hey what I

2507.86 --> 2512.6
do right now I really can do because of

2510.41 --> 2516.29
the Sun being up that's how it feels

2512.6 --> 2519.68
like it helps me to keep this frequency

2516.29 --> 2522.92
stable but in the evenings I'm kind of a

2519.68 --> 2525.5
different person a little just focus on

2522.92 --> 2527.26
other things other energies flows flow

2525.5 --> 2530.75
through me

2527.26 --> 2533.26
anyway if you guys could please think of

2530.75 --> 2539.39
something and spread the word that

2533.26 --> 2543.0400000000004
yeah I I really need a fund boost so I

2539.39 --> 2546.2
can get a new fresh air system

2543.04 --> 2548.0
and of course thanks everyone that has

2546.2 --> 2550.2999999999997
supported me in the last month

2548.0 --> 2550.3
especially

2554.89 --> 2558.42
Oh

2556.72 --> 2562.5899999999997
EHR not now

2558.42 --> 2562.59
except I probably

2563.37 --> 2569.7
not I don't really like cold that much

2566.8 --> 2569.7000000000003
journal towel

2586.76 --> 2592.7700000000004
and it's all really funny search echo

2589.82 --> 2594.02
but unless you actually want to donate

2592.77 --> 2597.89
please

2594.02 --> 2597.89
stop joking oh

2599.0 --> 2603.53
wait you're responding to journal

2601.2 --> 2603.5299999999997
whatever

2606.95 --> 2613.52
- 22 Celsius geesh that's terrible

2616.1 --> 2620.27
yeah don't care Major Tom

2627.53 --> 2634.7000000000003
yes sir check oh you can

2631.34 --> 2638.63
but not super chats please

2634.7 --> 2638.6299999999997
because that's not gonna help me

2641.37 --> 2644.39
went away

2665.84 --> 2668.56
right

2678.36 --> 2684.33
yeah with -22 like there's not a lot of

2681.9 --> 2687.38
things that can go around in that level

2684.33 --> 2687.38
of air and survive

2687.95 --> 2694.3399999999997
any kind of organism really dull just

2691.74 --> 2694.3399999999997
freezes to death

2700.45 --> 2705.9399999999996
oh that doesn't mean that if somebody

2702.82 --> 2709.84
does have it and they then go of course

2705.94 --> 2713.46
inside where it's not - 20 - yeah it can

2709.84 --> 2713.46
definitely then spread there

2719.19 --> 2725.25
but yeah it's just what flew its just

2722.71 --> 2725.25
flew out

2726.06 --> 2730.92
flew better than - 20 - yep

2736.14 --> 2740.12
[Music]

2756.76 --> 2762.32
there check out look you have freedom of

2759.77 --> 2765.65
speech but that freedom also comes with

2762.32 --> 2768.67
consequences so don't be such a

2765.65 --> 2768.67
complaining pants

2769.16 --> 2772.2999999999997
[Music]

2787.13 --> 2792.4990000000003
are you telling me to be honest I've

2789.769 --> 2793.6899999999996
been talking exactly what I thought it

2792.499 --> 2796.18
was

2793.69 --> 2799.18
from start

2796.18 --> 2799.18
so

2799.359 --> 2804.229
yeah either you haven't really paid

2801.619 --> 2805.6600000000003
attention because I have talked about it

2804.229 --> 2808.989
a lot

2805.66 --> 2808.989
exactly what it is

2812.48 --> 2819.41
yeah so check oh I don't really care so

2815.93 --> 2822.91
either you shut up and put up or get out

2819.41 --> 2822.91
this is getting really annoying

2831.79 --> 2835.65
[Music]

2845.85 --> 2851.25
yeah

2848.52 --> 2855.7599999999998
great

2851.25 --> 2858.76
why does always everybody just try to

2855.76 --> 2861.48
force it out of everyone to talk about

2858.76 --> 2865.03
it why Major Tom why

2861.48 --> 2866.92
every day every show always everybody

2865.03 --> 2871.6800000000003
has to talk about it I'm so sick of it

2866.92 --> 2871.6800000000003
I'm sick of talking about the corona

2876.36 --> 2881.88
it's a very complex thing

2879.09 --> 2883.8900000000003
it's a multi-front

2881.88 --> 2885.4500000000003
situation and

2883.89 --> 2888.64
I'm

2885.45 --> 2890.83
yeah everybody's already figuring out

2888.64 --> 2892.18
that it's a multi-front complex

2890.83 --> 2893.89
situation that there's multiple

2892.18 --> 2896.1699999999996
narratives and none of them all

2893.89 --> 2899.29
completely speak the truth and the

2896.17 --> 2901.71
situation is being pulled out as being

2899.29 --> 2904.7799999999997
happening it's probably not happening

2901.71 --> 2906.64
yet everybody still shows their

2904.78 --> 2908.71
narrative so it is seems just like a

2906.64 --> 2910.5899999999997
giant media operation probably the

2908.71 --> 2912.45
biggest ever

2910.59 --> 2916.1200000000003
it's the

2912.45 --> 2920.79
harnessing of the yearly ocurred

2916.12 --> 2925.77
reoccurring flu season in a

2920.79 --> 2929.98
police state themed style

2925.77 --> 2931.48
mostly pushed through media and then

2929.98 --> 2933.46
being spread through social media

2931.48 --> 2936.52
basically because of people being

2933.46 --> 2939.46
spellbound by the fear so it's a super

2936.52 --> 2941.29
complex thing it's huge it's probably

2939.46 --> 2944.41
the biggest spell ever unleashed and

2941.29 --> 2945.79
what on Western society bar maybe they

2944.41 --> 2948.52
like the moon landings and all that

2945.79 --> 2952.32
although this is this is much more

2948.52 --> 2957.16
concerted disapprove it's everywhere

2952.32 --> 2960.42
every country is has people that hype

2957.16 --> 2963.27
about this [ __ ] every freakin place

2960.42 --> 2965.4
so it's probably the biggest

2963.27 --> 2967.63
media

2965.4 --> 2970.37
driven

2967.63 --> 2972.83
social engineering project ever

2970.37 --> 2975.73
unleashed on the west okay is that good

2972.83 --> 2975.73
for you oh

2977.53 --> 2983.42
you wanted to talk about the virus did

2980.39 --> 2986.93
you oh you wanted me oh you want more

2983.42 --> 2989.21
detail updates about the deaf ear did

2986.93 --> 2992.27
you rule it's gonna get you know you

2989.21 --> 2994.88
wanted that you thought that is what

2992.27 --> 2997.93
this was about well guess what you're

2994.88 --> 3000.7200000000003
wrong because what is it

2997.93 --> 3004.69
well it's a

3000.72 --> 3008.1099999999997
less lethal but slightly more infectious

3004.69 --> 3012.55
airborne based version of the basic flu

3008.11 --> 3016.0
in the corona stem Veronica Mageia

3012.55 --> 3020.02
pretty much so yeah that's it it's less

3016.0 --> 3023.17
than lethal type of flu it's supposedly

3020.02 --> 3024.66
been manipulated doesn't really seem to

3023.17 --> 3028.75
matter anyhow

3024.66 --> 3031.8999999999996
because it's less lethal and it's known

3028.75 --> 3034.86
it's known people know it people know it

3031.9 --> 3037.9
hello hello

3034.86 --> 3040.3900000000003
why is it relevant why is the virus

3037.9 --> 3042.31
relevant it's not about the virus it's

3040.39 --> 3043.69
about the social engineering it's about

3042.31 --> 3046.6
the media operation it's about the

3043.69 --> 3050.68
Fairport and spellbinding people to that

3046.6 --> 3053.91
fear porn to make them do all these

3050.68 --> 3058.02
things create a quarantine

3053.91 --> 3060.58
to social check others if they are not

3058.02 --> 3062.47
if they are falling in line with being

3060.58 --> 3064.18
careful not spreading it that's that's

3062.47 --> 3066.2799999999997
what it is it's a social engineering

3064.18 --> 3070.4199999999996
operation okay it's not about the

3066.28 --> 3073.21
freakin virus not at all that's just

3070.42 --> 3075.07
that that's just a little globe that's

3073.21 --> 3076.9
their spell that's their little ball

3075.07 --> 3080.23
remember the ball with the suction cups

3076.9 --> 3082.75
it's the focus item for you to be afraid

3080.23 --> 3085.17
of for something that is CGI that you've

3082.75 --> 3088.24
never seen in reality

3085.17 --> 3091.4500000000003
that's the spell the invader the

3088.24 --> 3093.0099999999998
invisible invader like the aliens it's

3091.45 --> 3098.2599999999998
the invisible invader for you to be

3093.01 --> 3101.2000000000003
focused on well you let society social

3098.26 --> 3103.15
engineer itself into this weird police

3101.2 --> 3105.589
state social control

3103.15 --> 3109.6600000000003
scenario where it's moving towards

3105.589 --> 3109.66
trying to move towards that's what it is

3115.45 --> 3121.8489999999997
my thoughts about catching it is oh my

3118.76 --> 3125.289
god no not the sniffles okay I'll just

3121.849 --> 3129.309
take a little extra vitamin C done

3125.289 --> 3129.309
that's my thoughts about it

3130.99 --> 3134.319
nobody cares

3136.0 --> 3141.01
like literally nobody really cares

3139.03 --> 3143.38
people have probably already gotten it

3141.01 --> 3146.05
they didn't even notice it's already

3143.38 --> 3148.3900000000003
this even said people get it don't

3146.05 --> 3151.42
notice it just don't even show symptoms

3148.39 --> 3154.3799999999997
that never because it's a week it's a

3151.42 --> 3159.9700000000003
week strain it's not that special

3154.38 --> 3163.53
it's complete horse [ __ ] do you get it

3159.97 --> 3167.2599999999998
already it's not about the virus

3163.53 --> 3169.05
Corona is not about the virus hello

3167.26 --> 3173.11
hello blue

3169.05 --> 3175.15
how many times does this need to be

3173.11 --> 3176.04
repeated because before you figure it

3175.15 --> 3180.21
out

3176.04 --> 3180.21
it's getting so tiresome

3180.27 --> 3186.96
yeah don't give a [ __ ] Major Tom you

3183.07 --> 3190.42
don't know that you don't know that and

3186.96 --> 3193.42
hate people that are healthy can get the

3190.42 --> 3194.7400000000002
flu out of nothing also because they got

3193.42 --> 3196.03
a lot of tension worked up and their

3194.74 --> 3200.3799999999997
body seems fine and then all of sudden

3196.03 --> 3203.17
bang hits them heavy heavy flu typically

3200.38 --> 3204.67
happens to workaholics for example seem

3203.17 --> 3208.9
perfectly healthy and and all sudden

3204.67 --> 3212.25
bang hits them hard yeah that's the flu

3208.9 --> 3217.96
it's the flu it happens every year

3212.25 --> 3221.25
this virus is a less lethal version of

3217.96 --> 3222.87
the yearly reoccurring common flu hello

3221.25 --> 3226.21
hello

3222.87 --> 3229.08
is anybody getting in this anybody home

3226.21 --> 3233.04
they should be probably

3229.08 --> 3236.5499999999997
anybody home are you getting this

3233.04 --> 3239.65
it's not about the virus

3236.55 --> 3242.07
yeah I don't give a [ __ ] everybody gets

3239.65 --> 3244.57
sick everybody gets the flu

3242.07 --> 3247.23
people are living unhealthy people are

3244.57 --> 3249.4300000000003
constantly bound by their cell phones

3247.23 --> 3252.76
constantly if the radiation through them

3249.43 --> 3254.04
all these conditions not peanuts great

3252.76 --> 3257.38
sleep habits

3254.04 --> 3259.84
not great food habits bad social habits

3257.38 --> 3262.12
giving a lot of stress that is

3259.84 --> 3264.4
overlooked all that yeah so people get

3262.12 --> 3267.1
very sick all of a sudden that's right

3264.4 --> 3270.589
happens every year every year that

3267.1 --> 3272.75
happens you get it yet if it wasn't

3270.589 --> 3274.46
hyped about the supposed corona would

3272.75 --> 3276.47
you have even taken notice or just be

3274.46 --> 3278.049
like oh oh yeah my friend got the flu

3276.47 --> 3280.5789999999997
yeah

3278.049 --> 3283.7599999999998
happens to a lot of people every year

3280.579 --> 3285.5890000000004
yeah are you getting it yet are you

3283.76 --> 3288.559
getting it yet join up though hello

3285.589 --> 3291.069
George Major Tom everybody out here

3288.559 --> 3291.0690000000004
hello

3301.44 --> 3304.099
yeah

3305.3 --> 3311.4
well unicorn Slayer maybe you don't get

3308.19 --> 3313.94
sick because you get drenched in unicorn

3311.4 --> 3313.94
blood a lot

3319.22 --> 3325.0989999999997
which which overloaded hospitals are

3322.17 --> 3325.099
those Sochi echo

3325.369 --> 3333.75
we transfer those exactly where

3329.9 --> 3336.3
have you checked them or did you just

3333.75 --> 3338.48
see a story on the news have you checked

3336.3 --> 3341.67
it

3338.48 --> 3342.96
there was actually some there's

3341.67 --> 3345.54
interesting things going on because

3342.96 --> 3348.119
people are checking it here and there

3345.54 --> 3351.95
and then oh it's so full and then people

3348.119 --> 3354.569
go there and there's nobody there so

3351.95 --> 3357.66
hey I'm not saying this is everywhere

3354.569 --> 3361.77
but there's already signs that there's

3357.66 --> 3364.41
just fake reports about hospitals being

3361.77 --> 3369.14
full when it's not full so that's

3364.41 --> 3375.8689999999997
already going around right

3369.14 --> 3377.48
just stop it people stop falling for the

3375.869 --> 3381.78
fake news

3377.48 --> 3384.839
it's so ridiculous you guys all of you

3381.78 --> 3386.76
even the ball you already know you know

3384.839 --> 3388.589
fake news fake news all these news

3386.76 --> 3392.46
outlets they're fake well guess what

3388.589 --> 3394.2599999999998
they're doing now it's fake news you

3392.46 --> 3397.65
think they're gonna stop fake newsing

3394.26 --> 3401.1600000000003
all of a sudden now that a situation has

3397.65 --> 3404.04
arrived in a world oh no no no it's just

3401.16 --> 3405.41
another level of fake news now are you

3404.04 --> 3407.91
getting it yet

3405.41 --> 3409.859
you got to figure it out you're gonna

3407.91 --> 3412.41
check it you gotta check everything

3409.859 --> 3414.69
gotta see the sources do they even have

3412.41 --> 3419.04
sources or they just blank news

3414.69 --> 3420.589
bulletins look who are you paying

3419.04 --> 3424.44
attention

3420.589 --> 3426.92
are you looking and thinking what you're

3424.44 --> 3426.92
looking at

3429.72 --> 3432.9399999999996
[Music]

3437.98 --> 3444.6
[Music]

3441.17 --> 3446.85
yeah man like me that's correct legally

3444.6 --> 3451.11
they aren't anymore their infotainment

3446.85 --> 3455.42
that's what a lot of them are but if an

3451.11 --> 3458.1
article or something is sourced actually

3455.42 --> 3460.35
shows who wrote it then you can look

3458.1 --> 3463.5
into that person what they do understand

3460.35 --> 3466.29
for and then what it does that article

3463.5 --> 3468.93
mean how value is it is it is it likely

3466.29 --> 3470.88
to be brought back and what are the

3468.93 --> 3475.23
sources what are what are the actual

3470.88 --> 3477.12
data points you know but in this type of

3475.23 --> 3478.7400000000002
period when there is like this hype go

3477.12 --> 3481.5299999999997
around there is just gonna be a lot of

3478.74 --> 3484.68
news bulletins reports that don't have

3481.53 --> 3488.61
any real links they just say things they

3484.68 --> 3491.58
say experts or whatever or a university

3488.61 --> 3494.8700000000003
maybe and there will be no sources often

3491.58 --> 3497.34
it won't even show who wrote the article

3494.87 --> 3500.52
I've seen that going around a little bit

3497.34 --> 3503.2400000000002
more now so pay attention to that it all

3500.52 --> 3503.24
matters

3520.17 --> 3526.52
that's ridiculous AGM that doesn't work

3522.86 --> 3526.52
that can't work

3527.9 --> 3534.36
the whole point about vaccines why they

3531.72 --> 3536.54
do things is because they're injected

3534.36 --> 3539.9
intravenously

3536.54 --> 3542.1
in the blood

3539.9 --> 3544.02
through the water supply doesn't work

3542.1 --> 3546.35
yeah you can poison people through water

3544.02 --> 3550.73
supply and like with fluoride

3546.35 --> 3555.7799999999997
but you can't vaccinate like that

3550.73 --> 3558.09
that's not not theoretical and not from

3555.78 --> 3560.4300000000003
a grab ler perspective either not

3558.09 --> 3561.65
without just simply completely ruining

3560.43 --> 3564.18
the water

3561.65 --> 3566.04
so it doesn't work it doesn't work

3564.18 --> 3568.3999999999996
they're never gonna do that it's just

3566.04 --> 3571.68
not gonna work

3568.4 --> 3573.9
yeah well fluoride is in the water

3571.68 --> 3576.2
supply in some regions I'm pretty sure

3573.9 --> 3579.35
it's not in England though

3576.2 --> 3581.79
and it's not in the Netherlands

3579.35 --> 3583.68
but they're still regions in the US

3581.79 --> 3586.71
where is that and some European

3583.68 --> 3591.1099999999997
countries apparently - I heard this in

3586.71 --> 3591.11
Switzerland no good but

3592.609 --> 3598.449
that's not the same thing say I have a

3595.609 --> 3601.0589999999997
vaccine in a pill well

3598.449 --> 3603.699
potentially if it was like a

3601.059 --> 3606.92
specifically designed

3603.699 --> 3608.869
like a high-tech pill that was like

3606.92 --> 3610.929
designed specifically to bring it in a

3608.869 --> 3613.579
certain place and all that maybe

3610.929 --> 3616.609
high-tech Phil I don't know it doesn't

3613.579 --> 3620.949
matter I'm not gonna take that [ __ ] it's

3616.609 --> 3624.65
ridiculous I'm not gonna take anything

3620.949 --> 3627.789
nobody's gonna make me swallow or inject

3624.65 --> 3631.4
anything ever

3627.789 --> 3634.429
and if they try I'm gonna officially

3631.4 --> 3636.14
declare that before they go ahead that

3634.429 --> 3639.309
they are assaulting me and that I will

3636.14 --> 3639.3089999999997
respond likewise

3645.41 --> 3649.91
test why would I miss ridiculous

3656.75 --> 3661.79
yeah

3658.28 --> 3665.1800000000003
it will be equal in whatever we'll see

3661.79 --> 3665.18
you don't know

3665.48 --> 3670.2
everything is already combined the

3667.5 --> 3672.95
situation is already come why are you

3670.2 --> 3675.7799999999997
saying it will be it is

3672.95 --> 3679.23
there's not a virus that is actually

3675.78 --> 3681.48
really dangerous there is media hype to

3679.23 --> 3684.18
a great degree together with governments

3681.48 --> 3685.7
playing at this game keeping people

3684.18 --> 3689.7799999999997
spellbound

3685.7 --> 3692.0989999999997
while they progress control systems and

3689.78 --> 3695.48
overhaul the financial system that

3692.099 --> 3699.75
wasn't big trouble anyway so

3695.48 --> 3702.54
yeah combined it it's a it's a big

3699.75 --> 3705.54
overhaul it's kind of funny that way

3702.54 --> 3708.119
because yeah I say that viruses are like

3705.54 --> 3710.16
part of a metabolic overhaul system well

3708.119 --> 3712.65
guess what it seems like the Western

3710.16 --> 3717.0789999999997
world and much of the world is going

3712.65 --> 3721.9500000000003
into an overhaul right now

3717.079 --> 3723.329
in a transition in a pupil stage are

3721.95 --> 3726.359
they're just gonna rearrange things you

3723.329 --> 3726.6400000000003
could call it a reset but it is more

3726.359 --> 3729.75
like a

3726.64 --> 3729.75
[Music]

3729.799 --> 3735.5099999999998
reorganization

3731.54 --> 3738.329
effectively an organized reorganization

3735.51 --> 3740.88
transition period after which when it's

3738.329 --> 3744.69
over when they stop it thinks will

3740.88 --> 3746.4
suddenly unfold new things new moves and

3744.69 --> 3749.43
suddenly like the game is completely

3746.4 --> 3751.65
different and people will then gradually

3749.43 --> 3753.8089999999997
figure out like how things have actually

3751.65 --> 3755.64
changed because that's not directly

3753.809 --> 3757.049
apparent that just can move czar just

3755.64 --> 3759.299
gonna be made the new groups are just

3757.049 --> 3762.2599999999998
gonna do things and it's like wait what

3759.299 --> 3765.89
what is this country again like

3762.26 --> 3769.079
like things seem different

3765.89 --> 3771.299
like the rules work different now it

3769.079 --> 3774.03
doesn't make any sense you know because

3771.299 --> 3775.619
it's still constitutional but just like

3774.03 --> 3776.94
it's working different they're doing

3775.619 --> 3779.67
things differently now there's why is

3776.94 --> 3782.18
these checkpoints here for whatever you

3779.67 --> 3784.849
know that kind of thing so then you 911

3782.18 --> 3787.8489999999997
knows

3784.849 --> 3787.849
the

3787.96 --> 3790.96
yeah

3791.26 --> 3798.92
sort of not really though you know 9/11

3794.93 --> 3804.2799999999997
was just a trigger to start an attack to

3798.92 --> 3804.28
basically start to get the USA involved

3805.33 --> 3811.43
in the yeah in the Middle East more

3809.48 --> 3814.18
there was already preliminaries in it

3811.43 --> 3817.22
but just just get a bigger long term

3814.18 --> 3820.8399999999997
project going that with that that's what

3817.22 --> 3825.5899999999997
the 9/11 was really about blatantly

3820.84 --> 3830.09
this is more financial base that was the

3825.59 --> 3831.77
2008 crisis it yeah everyday postponed

3830.09 --> 3834.4700000000003
it pretty much he didn't really work out

3831.77 --> 3837.38
everything's gone worse now and this is

3834.47 --> 3839.3799999999997
just the next moment it's 12 years later

3837.38 --> 3841.69
and

3839.38 --> 3845.03
yeah

3841.69 --> 3847.46
it's got to change now and there's been

3845.03 --> 3850.0
new development since all that you know

3847.46 --> 3854.68
cryptocurrencies now here and

3850.0 --> 3857.78
just technology has developed

3854.68 --> 3859.99
mistakes are becoming obvious concerning

3857.78 --> 3862.3700000000003
environmental

3859.99 --> 3863.77
solutions that turn out not to be that

3862.37 --> 3867.68
greatest solution

3863.77 --> 3869.57
lessons now must be learned and then new

3867.68 --> 3874.3399999999997
ways phone and I bet they are because

3869.57 --> 3876.44
they have to like industry countries the

3874.34 --> 3879.98
way things will happen it has to adapt

3876.44 --> 3883.54
it has to no choice well blurb or

3879.98 --> 3883.54
they'll be blood in streets

3884.2 --> 3888.47
in the ways there are already are so it

3886.85 --> 3890.33
it has to be solved the pressures

3888.47 --> 3892.16
becoming too much for things to keep on

3890.33 --> 3894.0499999999997
going the way does so this was bound to

3892.16 --> 3897.1099999999997
happen and this is the way they're doing

3894.05 --> 3900.98
it it's the the virus scenario it's the

3897.11 --> 3902.29
movie Contagion as a playbook and while

3900.98 --> 3905.18
that happens

3902.29 --> 3906.71
things are being rearranged financial

3905.18 --> 3909.68
system is getting an overhaul markets

3906.71 --> 3912.53
are being splattered in order to wipe

3909.68 --> 3914.39
away to false promises to suggest a new

3912.53 --> 3915.92
clean start coming for which a lot of

3914.39 --> 3917.4
people will be waiting in the starting

3915.92 --> 3919.56
blocks to go

3917.4 --> 3921.12
and then in that all that time the game

3919.56 --> 3923.7599999999998
is going to be rearranged in order

3921.12 --> 3926.9
basically to set the path for how people

3923.76 --> 3928.8
are going to rebuild restart see and

3926.9 --> 3931.38
that's what they're doing in the

3928.8 --> 3933.9300000000003
background and then main in the meantime

3931.38 --> 3936.57
it's a social experiment like how well

3933.93 --> 3938.49
can we make people do certain things

3936.57 --> 3942.0800000000004
that are against their interest really

3938.49 --> 3946.47
because of fear using the virus story

3942.08 --> 3948.92
and that'll smoothen out give less

3946.47 --> 3950.5099999999998
friction to if they want to slightly

3948.92 --> 3953.58
militarize

3950.51 --> 3956.6400000000003
things a little bit more in countries to

3953.58 --> 3959.58
want to have more help having the heavy

3956.64 --> 3962.79
weapons police officers and all that

3959.58 --> 3964.74
that'll get easier because of it because

3962.79 --> 3967.71
people already fear about and they're

3964.74 --> 3969.4199999999996
like yeah but they need a very sure just

3967.71 --> 3970.86
to protect us against the corroding

3969.42 --> 3973.46
people that are any responsibly

3970.86 --> 3979.7400000000002
spreading it that kind of nonsense

3973.46 --> 3983.39
so yeah every complex system dammit I

3979.74 --> 3983.39
talked about it again

3988.75 --> 4001.359
[Music]

3997.299 --> 4005.589
not an Orwellian society will die very

4001.359 --> 4006.839
quickly it's not gonna work at all very

4005.589 --> 4009.759
quickly

4006.839 --> 4012.91
people that are trapped in it will be so

4009.759 --> 4016.9
demoralized that they'll just die very

4012.91 --> 4019.479
quickly it's no way Orwellian situation

4016.9 --> 4022.15
can survive no I think Orwell has just

4019.479 --> 4024.91
found its way through into Western

4022.15 --> 4027.19
society as a defense mechanism the

4024.91 --> 4030.069
double thing it's a way out when you

4027.19 --> 4032.109
there's no other way out so people can

4030.069 --> 4035.4
keep on going despite nothing making

4032.109 --> 4038.5789999999997
sense anymore I don't think it is the

4035.4 --> 4042.599
literal structure

4038.579 --> 4046.8900000000003
so maybe it is more like a

4042.599 --> 4048.9990000000003
soft 90-84 it is a cultural 90-84

4046.89 --> 4051.729
introduced through media through

4048.999 --> 4052.6499999999996
corporate struck or Peretz suggestions

4051.729 --> 4056.769
and

4052.65 --> 4059.38
through message boards think tanks same

4056.769 --> 4061.66
thing tanks that also yeah helped out

4059.38 --> 4063.069
the Bilderberg Group and all that it's

4061.66 --> 4066.19
yeah it's the same group that do that

4063.069 --> 4067.44
and that yeah so but it's gonna be kind

4066.19 --> 4069.759
of soft because

4067.44 --> 4072.759
legally it couldn't work and there's

4069.759 --> 4076.089
just just can't really happen not

4072.759 --> 4078.839
literally like that it just can't you it

4076.089 --> 4078.839
doesn't really work

4078.93 --> 4083.14
but they can apply it in the soft

4081.369 --> 4086.469
version and that's already been done

4083.14 --> 4090.39
pretty much that's been introduced

4086.469 --> 4093.459
already for a long time to push the

4090.39 --> 4095.5589999999997
Contra logic the counter logic to push

4093.459 --> 4100.469
the the reversed world thinking onto

4095.559 --> 4103.929
society that's a cultural revolution

4100.469 --> 4106.049
revolution against God pretty much it's

4103.929 --> 4109.75
a cultural revolution but it's not a

4106.049 --> 4111.79
government system really and everything

4109.75 --> 4113.08
that's gotten them power is because of

4111.79 --> 4115.109
social control it's because of the

4113.08 --> 4118.96
people that voluntary

4115.109 --> 4120.7300000000005
manipulate others to enforce that way of

4118.96 --> 4123.27
thinking and all that that's how it

4120.73 --> 4127.49
progressed not because of legal issues

4123.27 --> 4128.950000000001
it's because of the culture the

4127.49 --> 4132.139999999999
their

4128.95 --> 4136.58
subculture religion religious attitude

4132.14 --> 4140.26
about it so it's a social or an

4136.58 --> 4142.43
anti-social revolution not a

4140.26 --> 4144.47
government system like in the book

4142.43 --> 4146.41
because that that can't work it would

4144.47 --> 4149.570000000001
die out very quickly

4146.41 --> 4152.18
you know it can't work the elite know

4149.57 --> 4155.799999999999
that but it is still plenty of its the

4152.18 --> 4157.75
imagery is symbolic the fair is

4155.8 --> 4160.91
clear as

4157.75 --> 4163.25
a cultural phenomena it is seems to be

4160.91 --> 4166.43
effective and that's why they keep using

4163.25 --> 4168.52
it and basically allowing for people to

4166.43 --> 4171.7300000000005
do that to normalize it

4168.52 --> 4174.77
right so they polluted it

4171.73 --> 4176.41
the cultural well has been polluted with

4174.77 --> 4178.09
the 90-84

4176.41 --> 4181.67
style

4178.09 --> 4184.7300000000005
that doesn't mean that that will be the

4181.67 --> 4187.12
literal government like there's no way

4184.73 --> 4189.919999999999
no way can't survive

4187.12 --> 4192.61
can't survive without hope it's

4189.92 --> 4192.61
impossible

4193.42 --> 4198.49
so anyway that that's my thoughts on

4196.46 --> 4198.49
that

4234.099 --> 4239.38
that's a man like me that's completely

4236.8 --> 4241.3
wrong a lot of you said a lot of people

4239.38 --> 4244.42
can defend mind control when they don't

4241.3 --> 4247.869000000001
know it's happening now that's exactly

4244.42 --> 4250.349
what they do they do defend mind control

4247.869 --> 4255.329
because they don't know it's happening

4250.349 --> 4259.78
that's the point see that's

4255.329 --> 4261.79
that's what powers do to they don't know

4259.78 --> 4263.829
it's mind control so they defend it

4261.79 --> 4265.659
because they don't know it's happening

4263.829 --> 4267.369
they don't know it's mind control they

4265.659 --> 4269.92
they can't let it through that's the

4267.369 --> 4272.25
point so it's exactly the other way

4269.92 --> 4272.25
around

4272.73 --> 4278.98
if you don't understand it then you

4275.26 --> 4280.4800000000005
might defend it if you understand it and

4278.98 --> 4283.989
you just know it's wrong you're not

4280.48 --> 4287.459999999999
gonna defend it unless you're a grappler

4283.989 --> 4292.379999999999
and you want to exploit something see

4287.46 --> 4292.38
it's it's so pretty basic really

4301.76 --> 4305.08
oh

4302.48 --> 4308.8099999999995
[Music]

4305.08 --> 4310.78
yeah yeah you're hearing the ahem yeah

4308.81 --> 4313.46
we've got a Hannah over there that's

4310.78 --> 4317.87
especially since the spring time broke

4313.46 --> 4320.44
that hand is just is just shouting its

4317.87 --> 4323.599999999999
lungs out it's hilarious you

4320.44 --> 4326.12
can really feel its young spirit and

4323.6 --> 4329.860000000001
appreciate it let me see if I can catch

4326.12 --> 4329.86
some of that Mike

4354.8 --> 4358.09
I can hear the chicken

4387.459 --> 4391.938999999999
see

4389.779 --> 4395.439
so it's funny how that works out you

4391.939 --> 4399.259
know it's like okay church is closed but

4395.439 --> 4400.839
yeah so many people who are just having

4399.259 --> 4403.609
walks and

4400.839 --> 4405.289
having their kids play outside and

4403.609 --> 4408.619000000001
they're all having great fun you know

4405.289 --> 4411.7699999999995
kids love this like this this type of

4408.619 --> 4414.938999999999
Sun that really tends to inspire them

4411.77 --> 4414.939
[Music]

4420.34 --> 4423.399
[Music]

4429.55 --> 4433.77
[Music]

4437.21 --> 4443.9800000000005
[Music]

4441.009 --> 4450.17
don't cooperate

4443.98 --> 4450.169999999999
[Music]

4456.759 --> 4462.849
yeah it was Aldous Huxley wasn't it hm

4466.579 --> 4472.03
or what wait that could be somebody else

4470.02 --> 4475.3
uh

4472.03 --> 4475.3
was his name again

4481.659 --> 4488.199
yeah wait how old is Huxley was to the

4485.0 --> 4488.199
writer of drifting world

4490.179 --> 4493.659
what was his name again

4494.17 --> 4497.9800000000005
right Eric Blair

4504.06 --> 4510.110000000001
yeah you know

4506.39 --> 4512.0
when you really come compare the the

4510.11 --> 4516.03
1984 and

4512.0 --> 4518.37
and the brave new world books and those

4516.03 --> 4520.3099999999995
are books that I both read in school and

4518.37 --> 4523.59
studied too great I took it very

4520.31 --> 4525.950000000001
seriously did very serious presentations

4523.59 --> 4528.0
to watch my teachers

4525.95 --> 4529.53
which were one-on-one and they were

4528.0 --> 4531.17
extremely impressed that's why I got a

4529.53 --> 4535.46
pretty high grade

4531.17 --> 4538.13
on my English but

4535.46 --> 4541.08
I'm pretty certain that

4538.13 --> 4544.41
the world in the way it's becoming is

4541.08 --> 4547.98
much closer to brave new world although

4544.41 --> 4550.32
that went very very far it's like that's

4547.98 --> 4553.669999999999
like on the way outer end if this all

4550.32 --> 4557.4
persists you know it's much closer to a

4553.67 --> 4561.35
realistic world setup than 1984 which is

4557.4 --> 4561.349999999999
much more like a cultural thing

4562.43 --> 4568.860000000001
in a way

4565.19 --> 4571.469999999999
so even back then I said like yeah 1984

4568.86 --> 4573.389999999999
is just too much there's no way but

4571.47 --> 4575.0
brave new world yeah that could kind of

4573.39 --> 4577.85
work

4575.0 --> 4580.41
didn't realize the the

4577.85 --> 4581.72
implications back then because I was

4580.41 --> 4584.34
kind of atheist

4581.72 --> 4587.54
but I already then when I read is like

4584.34 --> 4590.66
yeah makes much more sense because

4587.54 --> 4593.6
they're trying to

4590.66 --> 4596.84
harness

4593.6 --> 4600.3
like arrange a system that'll

4596.84 --> 4602.34
provide at least certain forms of

4600.3 --> 4604.5
happiness and all that in order to keep

4602.34 --> 4606.87
things going to keep so it's much more

4604.5 --> 4610.5
it's like a really detailed engineered

4606.87 --> 4614.42
society it's really unnatural though but

4610.5 --> 4617.76
at least it seemed to be designed to

4614.42 --> 4620.58
to account for human needs up to a

4617.76 --> 4623.7300000000005
certain degree at least while 1984 was

4620.58 --> 4626.64
just pure pure panic pure fear and the

4623.73 --> 4629.9
despair so that could never persist that

4626.64 --> 4629.900000000001
was my conclusion back then

4630.01 --> 4636.780000000001
and it does seem like the the brave new

4633.82 --> 4639.57
world is much closer to what it's

4636.78 --> 4643.5
gradually slowly moving towards

4639.57 --> 4643.5
then in 1984

4645.35 --> 4650.31
[Music]

4650.44 --> 4657.94
man although I'm thinking also

4654.42 --> 4661.03
you know it's still like conspiracies

4657.94 --> 4662.889999999999
conspiracy theories that who the control

4661.03 --> 4664.63
or the ultimate rulers that hate all

4662.89 --> 4666.4890000000005
humanity want to wipe it all out the

4664.63 --> 4668.71
mega eugenicist they will replace us

4666.489 --> 4670.509999999999
with robots all that right well that's a

4668.71 --> 4672.55
really nice fancy that in reality never

4670.51 --> 4675.04
really works but I'm kind of surprised

4672.55 --> 4677.610000000001
that hasn't even been attempted to

4675.04 --> 4681.75
basically do a a

4677.61 --> 4683.61
cross reading a cross over between

4681.75 --> 4687.13
1984 and

4683.61 --> 4689.349999999999
Terminator The Terminator series not

4687.13 --> 4691.35
necessarily with a time element but just

4689.35 --> 4696.34
with a robot

4691.35 --> 4699.160000000001
hostile takeover in a way because that

4696.34 --> 4702.93
for the 1984 system that would literally

4699.16 --> 4706.9
be the only way out

4702.93 --> 4709.87
that would have seeming progress to the

4706.9 --> 4711.429999999999
controller elite in such a world well if

4709.87 --> 4713.469
it just continued the way it was yeah

4711.43 --> 4716.38
everything would die it's just everybody

4713.469 --> 4717.449
so demoralize just know everybody's just

4716.38 --> 4721.03
gonna

4717.449 --> 4723.04
it's nothing left eventually so there's

4721.03 --> 4724.5
no use no use for controllers to even

4723.04 --> 4728.17
have that

4724.5 --> 4729.18
so anyway the social engineering which

4728.17 --> 4730.4400000000005
it

4729.18 --> 4732.91
[Music]

4730.44 --> 4734.07
but it would be maybe interesting like

4732.91 --> 4736.449
as a

4734.07 --> 4738.219
series or a movie maybe there's already

4736.449 --> 4740.849999999999
stuff like that out there and I had just

4738.219 --> 4740.85
haven't even noticed

4743.55 --> 4747.88
in a way I shouldn't really even think

4746.35 --> 4749.6990000000005
about it too much there's already so

4747.88 --> 4752.92
much science fiction

4749.699 --> 4755.23
fear-based series and movies out there

4752.92 --> 4757.5
you know don't need to pile up on that

4755.23 --> 4757.5
anymore

4766.209 --> 4770.469
oh

4767.849 --> 4772.8
yeah the time machine was an interesting

4770.469 --> 4772.8
movie

4774.3 --> 4780.909000000001
or the book was more interesting

4777.849 --> 4782.999
actually but the original movie yeah I

4780.909 --> 4784.92
thought it was also pretty interesting

4782.999 --> 4787.78
and

4784.92 --> 4790.499
as it's a concept it is interesting it

4787.78 --> 4790.499
is yeah

4793.409 --> 4797.159
conceptual science fiction

4805.32 --> 4808.438999999999
[Music]

4823.949 --> 4826.518999999999
what

4833.2 --> 4837.25
please what okay

4837.49 --> 4841.12
don't know what that means

4851.8 --> 4857.25
in the island yes that's correct

4854.65 --> 4857.25
actually net

4869.309 --> 4877.829000000001
all right yeah ATM well makes sense you

4872.909 --> 4880.409
know the 1900s especially that remember

4877.829 --> 4883.889
it's often forgotten but remembered like

4880.409 --> 4887.36
the the World Fair and all that was in

4883.889 --> 4895.07
Chicago I think that was all

4887.36 --> 4899.42
like 1900 up until 1920 well futurism

4895.07 --> 4902.46
was a thing then that's really when that

4899.42 --> 4904.38
roamed its head so yeah all of these

4902.46 --> 4905.88
circles they would be talking a lot

4904.38 --> 4907.92
about like what is the future gonna

4905.88 --> 4910.139
bring where is it gonna go and figure it

4907.92 --> 4912.119
out like an industrialists who are all

4910.139 --> 4913.829
interestingly watching like what are

4912.119 --> 4915.808999999999
they gonna come up with what's what

4913.829 --> 4918.65
seems to be a good thing to try out you

4915.809 --> 4921.929
know it was a

4918.65 --> 4924.65
revolutionary time in many ways but it

4921.929 --> 4928.619
all came under the guise of futurism

4924.65 --> 4930.239
that's where a lot of the ideas even of

4928.619 --> 4931.5199999999995
the globe in outer space

4930.239 --> 4935.73
and

4931.52 --> 4938.27
satellites sees futurism that's

4935.73 --> 4940.589999999999
typically of that age and

4938.27 --> 4943.829000000001
so yeah there were a lot of books

4940.59 --> 4945.869000000001
written that's sort of at the same type

4943.829 --> 4950.659
of aim like let's think about the future

4945.869 --> 4954.57
as it's going it's in a way it was a

4950.659 --> 4957.42
it was kind of the birth of science

4954.57 --> 4960.659
fiction at it just thinking a lot of

4957.42 --> 4963.09
ahead and just looking at wow how

4960.659 --> 4966.388999999999
industries have already changed so much

4963.09 --> 4968.400000000001
well let's just imagine that there's one

4966.389 --> 4970.9490000000005
or two or three more of those events

4968.4 --> 4973.469
what would the super change future be

4970.949 --> 4976.829
like so yeah that's kind of the birth of

4973.469 --> 4979.789
science fiction was in that time and if

4976.829 --> 4982.789
in the future ISM

4979.789 --> 4982.789
time

4982.79 --> 4988.1
yeah great age of literature because

4985.2 --> 4990.66
they were all writing about it

4988.1 --> 4993.02
it's like everybody realized like wow

4990.66 --> 4996.63
the world's changing very fast

4993.02 --> 4999.120000000001
that means that Wow could become

4996.63 --> 5001.97
anything let's try to think of what it

4999.12 --> 5006.37
could become you know and everybody has

5001.97 --> 5006.37
their ideas and write about it

5010.21 --> 5014.41
yeah exactly one word

5029.079 --> 5033.849
see how interesting it is when you just

5031.51 --> 5036.639
take a look at all what was happening

5033.849 --> 5039.88
what people were typically preoccupied

5036.639 --> 5043.32
with what type of idea revolutions there

5039.88 --> 5046.3
was and then all fit it together and how

5043.32 --> 5050.829
government and society and the moon

5046.3 --> 5054.01
landings and the media control how that

5050.829 --> 5056.558999999999
all kind of unfolded step by step and

5054.01 --> 5060.52
back in the day a hundred years ago and

5056.559 --> 5062.59
more that people already in a degree saw

5060.52 --> 5064.4490000000005
some of these things coming back then

5062.59 --> 5066.969
isn't that just fascinating that just

5064.449 --> 5070.058999999999
saw it coming they figured it out back

5066.969 --> 5071.679
then in a to a great degree now they

5070.059 --> 5073.8
couldn't figure out every detail of

5071.679 --> 5077.17
course but a lot of the things that

5073.8 --> 5079.619000000001
they imagined sort of seemed to be

5077.17 --> 5081.75
happening one way or the other

5079.619 --> 5084.5199999999995
because

5081.75 --> 5086.409
people can do that people can get it

5084.52 --> 5091.329000000001
right when they think about the future

5086.409 --> 5094.23
and I hope well I try to do that in my

5091.329 --> 5098.549999999999
own way in him in a way I feel like a

5094.23 --> 5098.549999999999
futurism revivalism I

5098.699 --> 5103.869
believe in the future I believe in the

5101.679 --> 5106.84
future without the freaking globe in

5103.869 --> 5108.21
outer space to be necessary to satiate

5106.84 --> 5110.26
our our

5108.21 --> 5111.94
fantastical dreams I don't think that's

5110.26 --> 5116.04
necessary but I think that it has a

5111.94 --> 5117.96
place still as a as a science fiction

5116.04 --> 5121.739
subculture maybe

5117.96 --> 5125.29
in order to let some of it survive

5121.739 --> 5128.138999999999
but in a more controlled version not let

5125.29 --> 5130.349
it mind-control everyone to get to it

5128.139 --> 5132.46
such a degree and

5130.349 --> 5134.409000000001
figure out what we can do because

5132.46 --> 5137.409
there's so much new technology it's

5134.409 --> 5141.78
becoming so extreme and while we mostly

5137.409 --> 5144.759999999999
get distracted by military stuff like a

5141.78 --> 5147.699
weapon or something you know people are

5144.76 --> 5151.0
just tempted have the tendency to stare

5147.699 --> 5153.428999999999
blind at that and not realize just the

5151.0 --> 5155.559
grassroot revolutions that are becoming

5153.429 --> 5157.719
possible with the new technologies the

5155.559 --> 5159.2390000000005
printer technology I learned the 3d

5157.719 --> 5160.909
print is just becoming

5159.239 --> 5163.61
astounding

5160.909 --> 5165.339999999999
and people have 3d printers that

5163.61 --> 5168.018999999999
literally now

5165.34 --> 5169.76
they have trouble figuring out what the

5168.019 --> 5172.070000000001
hell to even do with it because it can

5169.76 --> 5174.889
do anything that kind of situation is

5172.07 --> 5177.669
arising so it's so like wow where

5174.889 --> 5181.6990000000005
there's a shortage of ideas

5177.669 --> 5183.979
it's it's really a shortage of ideas

5181.699 --> 5186.169
people there's actually a shortage of

5183.979 --> 5188.979
ideas in the face of the technology that

5186.169 --> 5192.709
is arriving that's kind of a sign

5188.979 --> 5193.929
to sign very similar to a hundred years

5192.709 --> 5197.119
ago

5193.929 --> 5198.4890000000005
it's time to think of what to do with

5197.119 --> 5201.889
all this

5198.489 --> 5204.829
it's a futurism revival we need to

5201.889 --> 5208.389
really figure out how to deal with all

5204.829 --> 5213.079
this technology in a wise way and

5208.389 --> 5215.059
envision a real future with it and how

5213.079 --> 5216.949
it will develop how our problems will

5215.059 --> 5219.559
some problems will also get worse

5216.949 --> 5221.719
there's still a lot of problems cultural

5219.559 --> 5224.389
wise and just universally that people

5221.719 --> 5226.159
have in this society that are probably

5224.389 --> 5228.919
going to get worse and we're gonna have

5226.159 --> 5230.989
to figure that one out too so it's time

5228.919 --> 5234.969
to really figure out where we're going

5230.989 --> 5234.968999999999
and what would be

5235.209 --> 5243.919
possible good and also yeah but maybe an

5241.309 --> 5246.159000000001
avoidable bad outcomes but at least

5243.919 --> 5248.469
think about it figure it out and

5246.159 --> 5252.888999999999
get a new

5248.469 --> 5255.409
use this momentum of the the singularity

5252.889 --> 5259.039
of the consciousness within the internet

5255.409 --> 5264.199
use it to start figuring it out and get

5259.039 --> 5265.869
a a second wave of futurism going based

5264.199 --> 5269.619
on sensibility

5265.869 --> 5269.619
and real data

5270.01 --> 5273.34
see how it kind of comes together like

5272.6 --> 5277.31
that

5273.34 --> 5279.02
we have no choice we have to do this if

5277.31 --> 5280.67
we don't it's all going to crash and

5279.02 --> 5283.540000000001
burn I think that's what I think this

5280.67 --> 5283.54
way I do what I do

5285.92 --> 5289.619
[Music]

5294.419 --> 5300.719
that's right Robin Stanley

5297.499 --> 5302.969
like technology is not just to make

5300.719 --> 5305.969
things more convenient for people to

5302.969 --> 5307.889
make them more lazy to allow them more

5305.969 --> 5310.26
room for their appetites that's not what

5307.889 --> 5313.59
technology is about that's only from the

5310.26 --> 5315.539000000001
grappler perspective you know then

5313.59 --> 5317.249
technology becomes a control tool no

5315.539 --> 5319.34
that's not what we should be doing what

5317.249 --> 5322.669
we should be doing is

5319.34 --> 5326.9890000000005
all these new opportunities use them

5322.669 --> 5329.999
to fix real problems

5326.989 --> 5331.919
and now there's been a lot of real

5329.999 --> 5334.978999999999
problems that have been ignored because

5331.919 --> 5336.959
there was no solution now we must figure

5334.979 --> 5338.899
out all these problems that have been

5336.959 --> 5341.28
overlooked and ignored and

5338.899 --> 5343.229
figure out if we now with everything

5341.28 --> 5345.869
that is there can find a sensible

5343.229 --> 5347.719
solution technologies become cheaper is

5345.869 --> 5350.549999999999
more precise more

5347.719 --> 5354.619
isolated less dependent on widespread

5350.55 --> 5358.439
productions and specific type of a heavy

5354.619 --> 5361.589999999999
heavy setups so can we use this to

5358.439 --> 5363.7390000000005
finally fix all those long-term problems

5361.59 --> 5366.4490000000005
that in some regions probably have just

5363.739 --> 5369.058999999999
lingered for for hundreds of years

5366.449 --> 5370.888999999999
because just nobody really knew what to

5369.059 --> 5373.139
do whether they just ignored it it's

5370.889 --> 5376.099
everywhere third world countries are

5373.139 --> 5380.51
full of this [ __ ] so

5376.099 --> 5380.51
yeah let's do it

5382.379 --> 5388.409
I'm now getting sick technology is not

5385.289 --> 5390.079
gonna be our downfall our appetites are

5388.409 --> 5394.098999999999
going to be our downfall

5390.079 --> 5397.619
not the technology technology

5394.099 --> 5401.01
doesn't do anything it's only what the

5397.619 --> 5404.28
people insert into the technology to do

5401.01 --> 5406.6990000000005
things that is what ruins things not

5404.28 --> 5406.699
technology

5406.879 --> 5412.019
although yeah there can be technologies

5409.679 --> 5414.419
out there that are just never going to

5412.019 --> 5417.149
be very good that are never going to

5414.419 --> 5419.76
benefit that are pretty much designed

5417.149 --> 5422.909000000001
just to control or they need to avoid

5419.76 --> 5424.7
that I need to clear that up but it

5422.909 --> 5428.12
doesn't mean all technology

5424.7 --> 5428.12
[Music]

5433.38 --> 5438.56
Yeah right by the way yeah thank you

5435.69 --> 5441.45
mind worked I did get your super jet

5438.56 --> 5445.080000000001
ten Australian dollars thank you my

5441.45 --> 5447.33
aunty works for government and they had

5445.08 --> 5450.84
a meeting about electric cars and the

5447.33 --> 5454.92
presenter showed our main city in 1920s

5450.84 --> 5457.860000000001
and two years ahead and it shows from

5454.92 --> 5460.31
going from a horse and cart to all cars

5457.86 --> 5463.3099999999995
in two years

5460.31 --> 5463.31
yeah

5463.85 --> 5473.570000000001
right well the Federal Reserve happens

5468.29 --> 5479.45
the oil got its way the petrodollar

5473.57 --> 5479.45
so yeah cars big transition

5480.05 --> 5483.320000000001
that's right

5483.95 --> 5489.46
[Music]

5486.999 --> 5492.159
yeah although your electric cars you

5489.46 --> 5495.34
know the electric cars are a dead end

5492.159 --> 5498.179
I'm certain of it now it's a complete

5495.34 --> 5498.179
dead end

5498.21 --> 5504.119
not meaning that all battery based

5502.179 --> 5507.039
electric

5504.119 --> 5509.098999999999
technology should be ignored and not

5507.039 --> 5510.63
used anymore but as a

5509.099 --> 5515.099
mass

5510.63 --> 5517.979
transit system as a mass transportation

5515.099 --> 5520.659000000001
cornerstone technology is not functional

5517.979 --> 5523.4400000000005
it's not good enough it rains too much

5520.659 --> 5526.629999999999
electricity that's not gonna grow less

5523.44 --> 5528.369
it's already way too much really so it

5526.63 --> 5531.55
drains too much electricity is actually

5528.369 --> 5534.098999999999
less cost efficient and there's it's

5531.55 --> 5536.53
expensive it's really expensive these

5534.099 --> 5538.92
batteries it's not easy to get that and

5536.53 --> 5541.989
eventually there's gonna be a cap

5538.92 --> 5545.32
it's technically impossible to have

5541.989 --> 5546.36
every household in the world have a tech

5545.32 --> 5549.299999999999
have a

5546.36 --> 5552.329
electric battery based car it's

5549.3 --> 5555.309
absolutely a hundred percent impossible

5552.329 --> 5557.11
on the other hand every household in the

5555.309 --> 5559.4490000000005
world could technically have a gasoline

5557.11 --> 5563.71
based car that is actually kind of

5559.449 --> 5565.719
doable yeah and not without issues but

5563.71 --> 5568.51
that is actually just a possibility

5565.719 --> 5570.999
there's enough steel to get all the cars

5568.51 --> 5573.969
there is definitely enough fuel to do

5570.999 --> 5576.63
that and hey in all that time in the

5573.969 --> 5576.63
hundred years

5576.9 --> 5582.638999999999
engines fuel based engines and diesel

5579.55 --> 5585.88
engines especially have become so much

5582.639 --> 5587.38
more efficient they literally become

5585.88 --> 5588.42
more and more more more more more

5587.38 --> 5590.769
efficient

5588.42 --> 5592.96
that's not going to happen with electric

5590.769 --> 5594.51
cars as much and besides they're simply

5592.96 --> 5597.96
not enough on the

5594.51 --> 5599.55
short-run earth can't work

5597.96 --> 5603.01
so

5599.55 --> 5606.610000000001
hydrogen cars could potentially work but

5603.01 --> 5609.159000000001
it is a big transition as well

5606.61 --> 5611.739
yeah and there's been tests in the

5609.159 --> 5614.619
Netherlands concerning it they tried it

5611.739 --> 5619.0199999999995
in buses but they stored the hydrogen in

5614.619 --> 5621.849999999999
tanks and then yeah that's not a

5619.02 --> 5625.179
in my opinion a very effective system

5621.85 --> 5627.67
yeah yeah because you if you're gonna

5625.179 --> 5629.7390000000005
carry around storage tanks filled with

5627.67 --> 5631.8
hydrogen everywhere that is potentially

5629.739 --> 5634.888999999999
a hazard I

5631.8 --> 5640.360000000001
think hydrogen yeah

5634.889 --> 5643.29
but if you bypass storage like that and

5640.36 --> 5646.36
just have water storage and then a

5643.29 --> 5649.929
small efficient system that literally

5646.36 --> 5652.719
creates hydrogen and oxygen but

5649.929 --> 5655.0
especially hydrogen from the water on

5652.719 --> 5658.179
the spot and then directly injects it

5655.0 --> 5660.25
into the motor as it is running then

5658.179 --> 5664.51
there is no storage of a dangerous gas

5660.25 --> 5666.46
and it'll be very much more efficient

5664.51 --> 5668.92
like that and then you could literally

5666.46 --> 5672.36
just have all cars run on water so it is

5668.92 --> 5675.36
a technical possibility

5672.36 --> 5675.36
however

5677.52 --> 5684.25
fuel gasoline based systems can still be

5682.18 --> 5686.92
very efficient and I think that

5684.25 --> 5689.35
eventually even though you could use

5686.92 --> 5690.24
water the amount of water that you would

5689.35 --> 5692.5
need

5690.24 --> 5695.26
would be more than the amount of

5692.5 --> 5700.29
gasoline fuel that you would need in the

5695.26 --> 5704.02
updated gasoline engines and diesel so

5700.29 --> 5706.72
yeah it's not over yet but to me

5704.02 --> 5711.06
electric based pure electric cars are

5706.72 --> 5716.04
just a novelty it's it's it's wasteful

5711.06 --> 5719.71
the costs more energy

5716.04 --> 5721.48
it just costs more this is not good it's

5719.71 --> 5723.34
not a good thing to standardize it's not

5721.48 --> 5727.329
gonna happen

5723.34 --> 5727.329
[Music]

5730.3 --> 5733.669
[Music]

5738.04 --> 5742.35
yeah that's really nice that's nice to

5740.68 --> 5745.42
interrupt ow

5742.35 --> 5748.620000000001
well maybe you'll have a really good car

5745.42 --> 5748.62
electric car I don't know

5749.13 --> 5754.66
the electric car should be able to

5751.45 --> 5756.13
charge itself really now that will be

5754.66 --> 5759.18
interesting but I don't think that could

5756.13 --> 5763.93
be very efficient

5759.18 --> 5767.26
it's an interesting idea I did you know

5763.93 --> 5769.450000000001
it's especially with a car it's just not

5767.26 --> 5771.280000000001
gonna work if you want it super

5769.45 --> 5773.49
efficient then it's gonna have to be

5771.28 --> 5775.78
something smaller

5773.49 --> 5779.07
it's something that has less weight it's

5775.78 --> 5782.2
just not gonna work it's not gonna work

5779.07 --> 5786.48
you want gasoline cars it's much more

5782.2 --> 5789.55
efficient and you can have bigger

5786.48 --> 5791.799999999999
like that without being extra dangerous

5789.55 --> 5794.02
you don't have to have like these used

5791.8 --> 5794.88
huge batteries that could be extremely

5794.02 --> 5798.46
hazardous

5794.88 --> 5801.25
so yeah okay look if you enjoy your

5798.46 --> 5804.63
electric car Jorn up now that's all just

5801.25 --> 5807.75
dandy that's all fine okay good for you

5804.63 --> 5810.91
but it's not a

5807.75 --> 5814.06
universal solution to standardize that

5810.91 --> 5817.2
for the world it's not never gonna be

5814.06 --> 5819.43
it's not it's not a good thing

5817.2 --> 5823.4
but yeah I'm not saying that you should

5819.43 --> 5834.88
forbid it it's just not a good solution

5823.4 --> 5834.879999999999
[Music]

5836.51 --> 5841.150000000001
right

5838.75 --> 5843.94
well look Robin Stanley it comes down to

5841.15 --> 5846.3099999999995
this if everybody had electric cars in a

5843.94 --> 5849.21
bigger city then that city would have to

5846.31 --> 5854.05
have one freaking giant power plant

5849.21 --> 5856.56
to literally just feed on to all those

5854.05 --> 5859.6900000000005
cars they would have to have like a

5856.56 --> 5862.9800000000005
large nuclear reactor just for one city

5859.69 --> 5862.98
it's crazy

5866.66 --> 5869.97
[Music]

5870.219 --> 5876.19
now maybe in Norway this kind of works

5872.89 --> 5880.030000000001
out but I'm pretty sure that in Norway

5876.19 --> 5881.37
not everyone has electric cars they'll

5880.03 --> 5884.37
be crazy

5881.37 --> 5884.37
nope

5884.969 --> 5892.7390000000005
okay well geomos thermal how are you how

5889.03 --> 5897.009999999999
much energy is going through all that

5892.739 --> 5899.62
how much energy do electric cars use on

5897.01 --> 5902.01
daily basis their Journal though what

5899.62 --> 5904.69
the percentage of the total energy

5902.01 --> 5908.41
spending in the country

5904.69 --> 5908.41
[Music]

5913.149 --> 5920.320000000001
if you charge at night it is okay well

5916.709 --> 5922.449
really it is is it because people do

5920.32 --> 5925.469
that they already do that but it's still

5922.449 --> 5927.148999999999
giving problems

5925.469 --> 5929.889
because

5927.149 --> 5932.349
if everybody's going to charge at night

5929.889 --> 5936.249
that means that just the power plan will

5932.349 --> 5938.82
have to run full steam just to feed all

5936.249 --> 5942.898999999999
those cars at night

5938.82 --> 5942.898999999999
so is that all right is

5942.929 --> 5948.82
that okay if if power plants all run

5946.179 --> 5951.43
double shifts because of electric cars

5948.82 --> 5958.099999999999
and it's also dandy

5951.43 --> 5958.1
[Music]

5959.159 --> 5965.58
alright sure you're enough though well

5962.429 --> 5969.9800000000005
look if you got if you got the precious

5965.58 --> 5969.98
minerals and if you got the that's it

5970.25 --> 5977.07
the trace the trace metals that you need

5974.489 --> 5979.83
for all that fine you go with that

5977.07 --> 5983.04
you're an opto for me I don't think so

5979.83 --> 5984.87
it's really nice if Norway is all Norway

5983.04 --> 5987.69
and you got all electric cars that's

5984.87 --> 5989.79
good for you yeah as far as I'm

5987.69 --> 5992.759999999999
concerned all of Norway can all have

5989.79 --> 5995.489
electric cars that's so really nice you

5992.76 --> 5999.09
go ahead you all just have electric cars

5995.489 --> 6000.53
go at I don't care I don't care it's not

5999.09 --> 6003.82
gonna happen with the entire world

6000.53 --> 6003.82
though that would be madness

6010.53 --> 6016.679999999999
Wow well that's [ __ ] join up though

6014.1 --> 6020.030000000001
power gets wasted because no one uses it

6016.68 --> 6023.88
so it's not stored then

6020.03 --> 6027.33
I'm pretty sure that power generators

6023.88 --> 6030.29
sexually store electric energy like in

6027.33 --> 6033.0
those giant motion machines and

6030.29 --> 6037.97
they're supposedly kind of efficient

6033.0 --> 6039.87
[Music]

6037.97 --> 6040.280000000001
so I don't know where you're getting

6039.87 --> 6050.479
that

6040.28 --> 6050.478999999999
[Music]

6052.79 --> 6057.2
Oh will it join up though with solar

6055.4 --> 6059.29
power it will work like a charm in

6057.2 --> 6062.87
Africa really

6059.29 --> 6066.85
well maybe in the desert regions they

6062.87 --> 6070.67
already got a lot of those but in Africa

6066.85 --> 6073.610000000001
really you know that solar panels do

6070.67 --> 6075.8
especially a lot of them have a pretty

6073.61 --> 6078.009999999999
negative influence on the surroundings

6075.8 --> 6080.09
right

6078.01 --> 6082.84
when they're like constantly being

6080.09 --> 6086.32
blasting and all that I

6082.84 --> 6086.32
don't know man

6088.82 --> 6093.95
you know solar power it is

6091.42 --> 6097.09
there are some developments in it as

6093.95 --> 6100.78
well but it's just not as great

6097.09 --> 6104.06
as everybody hoped it would be

6100.78 --> 6106.389999999999
yeah wind power is much worse by the way

6104.06 --> 6108.04
that is just terrible

6106.39 --> 6111.26
windmills

6108.04 --> 6114.22
those big ones that those are really bad

6111.26 --> 6117.2
that was the worst worst idea ever

6114.22 --> 6122.8
scarring landscape and just distorting

6117.2 --> 6122.8
things and leaving a lot of just junk

6123.5 --> 6136.469
[Music]

6133.739 --> 6139.7
does it though join opt out cuz solar

6136.469 --> 6145.219
has been out there for over 20 years

6139.7 --> 6149.16
as some of it is somewhat better but

6145.219 --> 6150.9890000000005
we also forget that the original was

6149.16 --> 6152.88
kind of freaking expensive and all that

6150.989 --> 6154.5
so a lot of people through a lot of

6152.88 --> 6156.57
money at it yeah that's nice and it's

6154.5 --> 6162.05
slightly better of 30 years okay and

6156.57 --> 6165.66
it's likely better now but is it worth

6162.05 --> 6168.89
just the the new amount of investment

6165.66 --> 6171.92
for the result that it is brought really

6168.89 --> 6175.320000000001
is it

6171.92 --> 6178.61
I'm not seeing like a market boom in

6175.32 --> 6183.139999999999
solar panel development really anymore

6178.61 --> 6183.139999999999
if you know what I mean it's still there

6184.73 --> 6189.0
yeah now well

6186.92 --> 6190.82
Jordan Abdallah you think it's it's

6189.0 --> 6195.12
worth

6190.82 --> 6197.25
50 more years of developing people

6195.12 --> 6199.98
throwing huge amounts of money against

6197.25 --> 6203.42
it until it finally becomes so somewhat

6199.98 --> 6207.0
efficient to do that I don't know and I

6203.42 --> 6211.4
don't think that's a wise course at all

6207.0 --> 6211.4
I think there's better ways to do it

6217.869 --> 6224.469
you know just just compare it either you

6221.829 --> 6229.209
have a whole giant field of solar panels

6224.469 --> 6235.629
or you have a a house with a pretty big

6229.209 --> 6238.869
engine in it and a huge drum of fuel and

6235.629 --> 6239.789
that would produce the same amount of

6238.869 --> 6242.848999999999
electricity

6239.789 --> 6247.409
day and night and

6242.849 --> 6250.269
could run for I don't know years and

6247.409 --> 6254.379
it would be much less expensive and

6250.269 --> 6257.01
especially leave so much less junk it's

6254.379 --> 6261.36
not gonna pollute the entire region

6257.01 --> 6264.579000000001
visually so no I think that

6261.36 --> 6267.268999999999
engine technology as a source of

6264.579 --> 6271.349
electrical power generation is

6267.269 --> 6271.349
much more viable oh

6272.28 --> 6277.228999999999
do they know do they give out more

6275.649 --> 6280.229
pollution

6277.229 --> 6280.229
really

6280.949 --> 6288.07
so an engine running and can filter that

6284.32 --> 6290.739
air out so practically there's only co2

6288.07 --> 6294.239
and water coming out of it you know

6290.739 --> 6297.039
that's it and that's

6294.239 --> 6298.598999999999
saving all that space not having a giant

6297.039 --> 6301.739
filled with all these reflectors and

6298.599 --> 6305.26
everything distorting things and I

6301.739 --> 6309.159
don't think so man I don't think so I

6305.26 --> 6311.110000000001
think that just a house with a with a

6309.159 --> 6313.808999999999
power generating a big engineering in

6311.11 --> 6315.429999999999
the fuel drum large enough I think

6313.809 --> 6325.589
that's a lot more efficient

6315.43 --> 6325.589
[Music]

6326.51 --> 6335.530000000001
yeah well Jordan opt-out hello there's a

6331.13 --> 6338.650000000001
lot of it there's a lot of oil

6335.53 --> 6342.04
what's the problem

6338.65 --> 6342.04
what's the problem

6354.34 --> 6360.13
unless you want to go with the

6357.24 --> 6362.53
leftist environment environmentalist

6360.13 --> 6365.47
alarmist conspiracy theory that the oil

6362.53 --> 6367.95
is running out which we know absolutely

6365.47 --> 6370.96
is not happening oh

6367.95 --> 6373.62
it is killing you slowly how how is it

6370.96 --> 6373.62
killing you slowly

6377.88 --> 6383.25
tell me Journal though how is it killing

6380.92 --> 6383.25
you slowly

6389.59 --> 6392.749
[Music]

6398.77 --> 6405.56
all right there we go the greenhouse

6402.349 --> 6407.96
effect oh my god Jordan should be

6405.56 --> 6409.570000000001
ashamed of yourself I'm serious man this

6407.96 --> 6412.72
is just

6409.57 --> 6412.719999999999
[Music]

6414.04 --> 6424.36
like I literally just lost all respect

6418.219 --> 6424.36
for you all of it that's so it's just

6430.36 --> 6433.36
unbelievable

6437.9 --> 6441.049999999999
[Music]

6441.67 --> 6447.25
yeah it is my right and I am right

6444.55 --> 6449.9800000000005
because it's absolutely [ __ ] the

6447.25 --> 6453.85
greenhouse effect what what greenhouse

6449.98 --> 6456.33
effect what is a greenhouse effect why

6453.85 --> 6458.860000000001
is it called a greenhouse effect

6456.33 --> 6460.99
ever thought of it turned up though why

6458.86 --> 6463.32
is it called a greenhouse effect could

6460.99 --> 6467.53
it because

6463.32 --> 6472.5
you have a house it's closed off its own

6467.53 --> 6477.639999999999
little air thing and there's green in it

6472.5 --> 6481.03
plants it's a greenhouse and you know a

6477.64 --> 6484.530000000001
lot of these growers they inject co2 in

6481.03 --> 6488.139999999999
their greenhouses why do they do that

6484.53 --> 6490.86
hmm maybe because the plants grow better

6488.14 --> 6490.860000000001
uh

6492.24 --> 6498.28
what you think's is gonna happen if we

6495.84 --> 6501.79
pull out more co2 what do you think is

6498.28 --> 6504.63
gonna happen oh no it's good as do she

6501.79 --> 6507.55
Mary she's gonna melt in

6504.63 --> 6512.7
the hockey stick graph said in Houston

6507.55 --> 6516.04
toughest or just more plants growing

6512.7 --> 6519.34
you know just gonna grow faster because

6516.04 --> 6520.89
they they got more airs like ah yes

6519.34 --> 6523.89
finally

6520.89 --> 6523.89
mmm

6540.53 --> 6547.2699999999995
it's it it just think the greenhouse

6544.01 --> 6550.85
effect is so ridiculously outdated it's

6547.27 --> 6554.120000000001
unbelievable and it's all based on this

6550.85 --> 6556.58
[ __ ] idea that the planet's

6554.12 --> 6560.5
atmosphere could go out of whack and

6556.58 --> 6563.66
something could change and they will die

6560.5 --> 6568.15
[ __ ] heliocentric based fear porn

6563.66 --> 6570.13
nonsense of the environmental variety

6568.15 --> 6574.03
that's what it is

6570.13 --> 6576.83
absolute [ __ ] so dumb

6574.03 --> 6580.37
so dumb I can't believe that originally

6576.83 --> 6582.68
like until my teens I kind of believed

6580.37 --> 6584.39
it I feel so stupid that I even believed

6582.68 --> 6586.27
it up until I like was ten or something

6584.39 --> 6588.59
I can believe that I fell for that

6586.27 --> 6590.650000000001
doesn't matter that I was ten it's just

6588.59 --> 6592.6
so dumb I should have seen that

6590.65 --> 6596.36
immediately

6592.6 --> 6598.0
yeah you know people were very worried

6596.36 --> 6601.33
about it

6598.0 --> 6601.33
because they're dumb

6604.36 --> 6611.23
anyway I think I'm gonna round out to

6606.68 --> 6611.2300000000005
show Wow going for almost two hours

6614.02 --> 6620.0
somebody's having a party

6617.35 --> 6623.56
having a little concert with some dutch

6620.0 --> 6626.83
slag or music or something

6623.56 --> 6626.830000000001

6642.719 --> 6646.7300000000005
yeah anyway

6651.36 --> 6654.259999999999
just

6657.349 --> 6664.4890000000005
yes all you're welcome you know it's

6660.73 --> 6668.659
look I don't think you're a bad guy

6664.489 --> 6670.879999999999
you're just typical European level

6668.659 --> 6672.409
indoctrinated and in the north they all

6670.88 --> 6674.78
seem to have it one way or the other the

6672.409 --> 6678.25
sweeties are much worse so okay you're

6674.78 --> 6683.23
still better than the sweets it's okay

6678.25 --> 6686.989
but yeah to say

6683.23 --> 6688.449
global warming or green out yeah look

6686.989 --> 6692.0
the greenhouse effect

6688.449 --> 6693.829
warming climate change manmade time and

6692.0 --> 6696.59
that's what it's that's what it is it's

6693.829 --> 6699.369
so outdated you can't believe you're

6696.59 --> 6704.8
still holding on to that I

6699.369 --> 6704.799999999999
know you do I'm very well aware of the

6704.92 --> 6709.46
the feelings of national competition

6707.9 --> 6712.48
with your neighbors and very well of

6709.46 --> 6712.4800000000005
that and well aware of it

6720.85 --> 6726.39
and they have been pretty much going

6722.92 --> 6730.29
overboard with the whole naivety so

6726.39 --> 6730.29
you're still not as bad as that

6739.07 --> 6742.549999999999
[Music]

6746.129 --> 6751.599
anakata yeah I

6748.919 --> 6754.239
don't even know when the word was really

6751.599 --> 6756.419
introduced when they still brought that

6754.239 --> 6759.009999999999
in as a word I

6756.419 --> 6760.769
could make a really stupid joke about it

6759.01 --> 6764.679
though

6760.769 --> 6767.26
because maybe a racist originally meant

6764.679 --> 6769.979
people who just really didn't like horse

6767.26 --> 6769.979
racing and

6770.639 --> 6776.019
then when car racing came around they

6773.649 --> 6779.349
really didn't like that so they were

6776.019 --> 6781.649
declared racist sorry it's just dumb

6779.349 --> 6781.649
joke

6791.0 --> 6804.15
