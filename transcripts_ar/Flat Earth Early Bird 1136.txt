yeah the weather today is

103.079 --> 106.52
a bit of a gray day

107.479 --> 111.92
jackdaws are having a bit of a spree

109.619 --> 111.92
there

112.979 --> 119.82
with some bread I dropped there earlier

115.439 --> 122.219
then seagull started to swarm the place

119.82 --> 125.15899999999999
and it freaking hates seagulls

122.219 --> 127.5
just a bunch of looters

125.159 --> 129.42000000000002
so I just took most of the bread away so

127.5 --> 131.34
the seagulls would piss off and now

129.42 --> 134.57999999999998
they're just

131.34 --> 138.02
picking the crumbs and I'll drop the

134.58 --> 138.02
rest of the bread the bread later

141.239 --> 143.78
all right

147.9 --> 150.66
hello

149.45 --> 152.879
[Music]

150.66 --> 154.85999999999999
Kevlar first in chat Bill Nye the

152.879 --> 158.64
science deniers Jeff gas had Mike

154.86 --> 164.94000000000003
zidunich good to see you

158.64 --> 164.94
it is Tuesday the 25th of January 2022.

166.56 --> 173.81900000000002
a bit late because yeah I needed my

170.94 --> 177.54
sleep this night apparently since I

173.819 --> 178.61999999999998
woke up exactly when the show should be

177.54 --> 181.319
starting

178.62 --> 183.239
so that's it needed some extra time to

181.319 --> 185.89999999999998
wake up and all that

183.239 --> 185.9
ah

186.18 --> 192.06
might have something to do with like

189.0 --> 194.819
having to have

192.06 --> 197.7
with having to lift a washing machine

194.819 --> 199.14
like off threes flights of stairs

197.7 --> 201.17999999999998
yesterday

199.14 --> 204.44
and then

201.18 --> 204.44
all right hold on

211.2 --> 213.85999999999999
ah

215.159 --> 220.67999999999998
because yeah it was getting fixed but I

217.739 --> 224.09900000000002
had to help carry it down

220.68 --> 227.519
and the guy from the shop was all very

224.099 --> 231.11999999999998
enthusiastic I think he probably is like

227.519 --> 233.459
also a kids sports trainer or something

231.12 --> 235.37900000000002
because he was constantly talking to me

233.459 --> 236.58
like I was really young like oh you

235.379 --> 239.39999999999998
could do it you have all the strength

236.58 --> 242.09900000000002
inside he was very spirited I really

239.4 --> 243.959
liked it but it was a bit out of place

242.099 --> 247.56
because like I didn't even say anything

243.959 --> 251.519
but like a little do you realize I'm

247.56 --> 255.12
probably even older than you maybe not

251.519 --> 257.459
maybe he was like somewhere in his 40s

255.12 --> 260.34000000000003
but yeah so am I but I don't think he he

257.459 --> 262.919
realized that from me it was just really

260.34 --> 266.17999999999995
heavy and I didn't want to like get go

262.919 --> 266.18
through my back and all that

266.82 --> 272.18
but anyway yeah it worked out it's in

269.4 --> 272.17999999999995
the shop right now

276.24 --> 282.0
I hope I'm gonna get all this money back

279.84 --> 283.02
because I'm basically having to pay for

282.0 --> 286.56
it all

283.02 --> 288.71999999999997
and then supposedly

286.56 --> 290.58
I should be getting the money back from

288.72 --> 292.56
my roommates

290.58 --> 294.71999999999997
which basically said they would split it

292.56 --> 296.639
up but yeah I hope that actually works

294.72 --> 299.0
out otherwise I'm gonna be very broke

296.639 --> 299.0
this

299.52 --> 303.35999999999996
right anyway

301.62 --> 306.5
low backs

303.36 --> 306.5
good to see you

307.919 --> 312.419
right but yeah from all that lifting I

310.02 --> 315.59999999999997
got a bit of a muscle ache because yeah

312.419 --> 317.94
it's a freaking washing machine

315.6 --> 319.74
no elevator I had to carry it down three

317.94 --> 322.86
flights of stairs

319.74 --> 325.40000000000003
and I'm not really used to heavy lifting

322.86 --> 325.40000000000003
a lot of things

325.68 --> 330.24
I mean the only thing I regularly lift

328.32 --> 331.8
that's kind of heavy could be considered

330.24 --> 334.5
is

331.8 --> 337.199
my water tank

334.5 --> 339.06
like the Berkey water tank filled up

337.199 --> 341.88
with water and then I have to lift it

339.06 --> 343.5
from the sink to the yeah to where it's

341.88 --> 345.18
supposed to be

343.5 --> 347.46
I do that

345.18 --> 350.039
at least once a week

347.46 --> 353.28
a little over

350.039 --> 355.919
like every four or five days

353.28 --> 358.55999999999995
and that's kind of heavy lifting so I'm

355.919 --> 360.24
not like completely washed out

358.56 --> 363.12
but yeah I'm not

360.24 --> 364.38
doing any typical heavy lifting work so

363.12 --> 368.6
yeah

364.38 --> 368.6
my muscles are a bit sore right now but

368.819 --> 371.53900000000004
I'm doing okay

376.44 --> 382.039
and most people don't know how to lift

378.24 --> 382.039
things yeah well I do

383.16 --> 388.16
how's the landlord and roommate

384.84 --> 388.15999999999997
situation these days good

388.62 --> 391.639
it's overall good

396.72 --> 402.18
landlord hasn't given us any

399.3 --> 404.88
real issues and

402.18 --> 406.62
and yeah I think like the the there's a

404.88 --> 408.36
good balance between me and my roommates

406.62 --> 410.639
right now

408.36 --> 412.319
and yeah the tension had been kinda

410.639 --> 417.3
running up because of the washing

412.319 --> 420.599
machine was broken for like a month

417.3 --> 423.3
and yeah that one roommate guy is like

420.599 --> 425.58
he really uses that washing machine he's

423.3 --> 427.86
like constantly washing

425.58 --> 431.0
been Overkill in my opinion but yeah

427.86 --> 431.0
that's how it works

432.0 --> 437.419
but yeah he's very happy it's getting

433.979 --> 437.419
repaired too so

437.759 --> 442.52000000000004
I everything else is pretty much fine

443.16 --> 448.639
it's mostly my financial situation

445.199 --> 448.639
that's the trouble these days

449.22 --> 451.22
um

457.919 --> 460.28
right

461.099 --> 464.9
anyway I'm here now

470.78 --> 476.35999999999996
Arwen is becoming a member the member of

474.12 --> 476.36
what

488.759 --> 492.44
what are you talking about Max

504.24 --> 508.919
by the way has anybody noticed there's a

506.34 --> 511.75899999999996
weird scrolling bug

508.919 --> 511.75899999999996
recently

512.039 --> 517.56
it's like a scroll lock as soon as you

514.32 --> 519.719
scroll the chat completely down it gets

517.56 --> 522.0799999999999
stuck and you can't use like scroll

519.719 --> 522.08
wheel

525.12 --> 529.2
to go up anymore you have to manually

527.82 --> 531.36
push

529.2 --> 535.339
the sidebar up

531.36 --> 535.339
because it wants to stick down there

538.8 --> 543.26
it's just a minor nuisance though

545.88 --> 552.18
well would be great if you could just

548.04 --> 555.24
scroll back up and down again

552.18 --> 558.7199999999999
if you have a scroll wheel cause cause

555.24 --> 561.8
moist Club that's yeah hello I have no

558.72 --> 561.8000000000001
idea what you're talking about

580.2 --> 585.9590000000001
Mac huh

582.6 --> 588.6800000000001
it could be maybe it's a PC or like a

585.959 --> 588.68
Windows thing

589.019 --> 592.74
or maybe it's Firefox but that that

591.06 --> 597.3199999999999
wouldn't make any sense because it's

592.74 --> 597.32
like a reasoned a recent effect

600.12 --> 606.019
right

601.5 --> 606.019
YouTube interfaces change all the time

610.32 --> 613.0400000000001
anyway

613.26 --> 619.079
it's not really that important

615.6 --> 623.48
it was just something that I noticed

619.079 --> 623.4799999999999

yeah well I don't give a [ __ ]

1236.419 --> 1241.22
although what did they even mean with

1238.4 --> 1242.6000000000001
that debating the nature of reality

1241.22 --> 1244.64
right

1242.6 --> 1247.6999999999998
I mean if you're going to debate the

1244.64 --> 1250.2800000000002
nature of reality in ways

1247.7 --> 1252.26
that's like outside of Simply

1250.28 --> 1254.84
establishing what is real and what is

1252.26 --> 1258.2
not and then conceptualizing and

1254.84 --> 1260.4189999999999
philosophizing I'd say yes that is kind

1258.2 --> 1261.98
of pointless

1260.419 --> 1264.14
because

1261.98 --> 1266.299
you're just wandering away in

1264.14 --> 1269.24
conceptions

1266.299 --> 1272.48
that aren't really even focused on

1269.24 --> 1275.14
reality so that's not very helpful

1272.48 --> 1275.14
but

1275.419 --> 1280.94
simply figuring out what is real and the

1278.539 --> 1283.64
details of it and comparing ideas

1280.94 --> 1285.6200000000001
comparing it with everything to

1283.64 --> 1287.96
establish how things really work I don't

1285.62 --> 1289.8799999999999
think that is an ineffectual campaign at

1287.96 --> 1291.799
all

1289.88 --> 1295.1000000000001
I think that's actually provably

1291.799 --> 1296.96
training our senses

1295.1 --> 1299.84
and her grip

1296.96 --> 1302.299
and even the car are confident so

1299.84 --> 1303.74
yeah I don't agree I don't agree with

1302.299 --> 1306.559
Zen Buddhists

1303.74 --> 1309.52
I don't agree with Buddhists in that

1306.559 --> 1309.52
sense even

1315.26 --> 1319.64
Bex

1317.0 --> 1321.98
I'm gonna time you out backs you're

1319.64 --> 1326.14
gonna step away

1321.98 --> 1326.14
and you're gonna get some rest right now

1354.38 --> 1356.919
available

1359.059 --> 1361.78
hmm

1363.28 --> 1368.98
spiritual organic

1365.9 --> 1368.98
and mechanical

1369.2 --> 1373.48
yeah well wrath it's all of that

1374.059 --> 1377.74
right it's all a matter of approach

1400.159 --> 1403.7600000000002
I mean

1401.539 --> 1406.24
yeah what's it like

1403.76 --> 1406.24
spirit

1406.82 --> 1412.34
life

1409.039 --> 1413.96
and mechanisms

1412.34 --> 1417.74
right

1413.96 --> 1421.3400000000001
so Nuts and Bolts hardware

1417.74 --> 1422.84
yeah that's the mechanical situation of

1421.34 --> 1425.84
this realm

1422.84 --> 1428.4189999999999
then there's the organisms

1425.84 --> 1432.08
that are specifically

1428.419 --> 1435.26
a connection between the spiritual and

1432.08 --> 1439.1
the physical substance

1435.26 --> 1442.12
right matter infused with spirit

1439.1 --> 1445.039
that's predominant it's like the center

1442.12 --> 1447.62
situation of the entire spiritual

1445.039 --> 1450.919
Paradigm it's the interface

1447.62 --> 1453.9189999999999
and then there is the purely spiritual

1450.919 --> 1457.7
because the spirit even in organisms can

1453.919 --> 1459.6200000000001
also exist separately

1457.7 --> 1460.94
and there are exclusively spiritual

1459.62 --> 1463.9599999999998
entities

1460.94 --> 1463.96
on the other side

1465.08 --> 1469.84
that do not have an organic bunny of

1467.48 --> 1469.84
Their Own

1470.779 --> 1475.84
so and that's all yeah so good to

1473.48 --> 1475.84
realize

1479.36 --> 1484.6399999999999
yeah Matthew I agree but he was just not

1482.179 --> 1486.799
stopping so I timed him out I really

1484.64 --> 1489.7990000000002
hope he takes my advice and just

1486.799 --> 1492.08
lays down and

1489.799 --> 1495.58
gets his bearings back because he was

1492.08 --> 1495.58
just rambling nonsense

1495.74 --> 1498.74
foreign

1503.57 --> 1506.6599999999999
[Music]

1520.82 --> 1523.82
no

1523.88 --> 1528.3200000000002
I think Bex is just really frustrated I

1526.52 --> 1530.12
think he probably had some really bad

1528.32 --> 1532.82
news

1530.12 --> 1535.58
and he can't communicate it properly

1532.82 --> 1537.5
he's still flustered

1535.58 --> 1541.12
so he just needs to get his bearings

1537.5 --> 1541.12
back calm down

1543.02 --> 1546.76
and take a power nap or something

1547.34 --> 1551.6589999999999
because just being flustered and unable

1549.559 --> 1554.44
to communicate your situation doesn't

1551.659 --> 1554.44
help anybody

1575.39 --> 1579.0790000000002
[Music]

1582.85 --> 1589.2199999999998
[Music]

1586.64 --> 1592.64
data I saw Owen Benjamins where they go

1589.22 --> 1594.74
stream yeah the X dude I've already been

1592.64 --> 1597.26
referencing it

1594.74 --> 1599.419
on multiple occasions

1597.26 --> 1601.84
but yeah it was really intense and

1599.419 --> 1601.8400000000001
really good

1602.72 --> 1608.539
and really helpful

1605.36 --> 1610.76
the wetigo is a really good model as an

1608.539 --> 1614.779
alternative for saying yeah you're

1610.76 --> 1619.94
possessed by your demons because demons

1614.779 --> 1621.799
quite a load added to them that has a

1619.94 --> 1625.3400000000001
big cultural response and a lot of

1621.799 --> 1627.32
people it makes them scared or

1625.34 --> 1630.9399999999998
or they start to reference other things

1627.32 --> 1630.9399999999998
that don't really directly relate

1631.7 --> 1638.02
and yeah oh Benjamin also pointed out

1634.1 --> 1638.02
that the wetigo doesn't do that

1642.26 --> 1646.7
that doesn't mean that I'm gonna use it

1644.179 --> 1649.159
but I think it's appropriate I will

1646.7 --> 1651.5
reference it as a concept because it's a

1649.159 --> 1653.919
pretty good concept to explain how this

1651.5 --> 1653.919
works

1658.1 --> 1660.279
foreign

1688.659 --> 1694.1000000000001
right because that's the whole point

1691.279 --> 1697.1
that's why I do it too right

1694.1 --> 1699.9189999999999
in a way Owen Benjamin inspired me to do

1697.1 --> 1701.779
that like two years ago when I first

1699.919 --> 1704.659
started seeing him

1701.779 --> 1706.64
because I was like I've been bothered by

1704.659 --> 1708.6200000000001
trolls for a very long time and they

1706.64 --> 1711.2
would try to get under my skin and my

1708.62 --> 1715.299
original approach was just let

1711.2 --> 1715.299
them do whatever that is

1715.46 --> 1720.559
let them try to get close to me

1718.52 --> 1723.34
and then show that I am basically

1720.559 --> 1723.34
immutable

1723.86 --> 1728.9599999999998
and not manipulatable

1726.44 --> 1731.179
well

1728.96 --> 1734.48
that was effective

1731.179 --> 1735.679
for a time but then they just got all

1734.48 --> 1737.779
worse

1735.679 --> 1740.26
and own Benjamin

1737.779 --> 1744.02
kind of showed me how to make a game

1740.26 --> 1745.76
about it that's actually entertaining

1744.02 --> 1748.52
right

1745.76 --> 1752.6
it's not just oh troll they're so

1748.52 --> 1756.26
bothersome oh I'm gonna be oh

1752.6 --> 1759.1399999999999
bothered by it no you can just turn

1756.26 --> 1761.24
dealing with trolls into amusement and

1759.14 --> 1764.44
he showed that how to do that and I'm

1761.24 --> 1764.44
very grateful for that

1767.96 --> 1773.779
and yes it's all wetting like that's

1771.14 --> 1776.5
what the trolls do they are more wet to

1773.779 --> 1776.5
go than person

1776.74 --> 1781.7
they're so

1779.24 --> 1784.299
being dragged around by the way down by

1781.7 --> 1784.299
their wedding go

1787.64 --> 1791.3600000000001
and that makes them also extremely

1789.62 --> 1794.36
predictable

1791.36 --> 1799.6999999999998
I'm the ultimate troll Slayer

1794.36 --> 1799.6999999999998
that sounds really gamma but

1799.82 --> 1805.34
yeah if they just happen to wonder

1802.82 --> 1809.1399999999999
in and think they can do their thing

1805.34 --> 1809.1399999999999
yeah I will slay them absolutely

1833.24 --> 1835.419
foreign

1837.62 --> 1843.7399999999998
so but yeah in overall I deal a lot with

1841.039 --> 1846.039
where to goes through other people a lot

1843.74 --> 1846.039
of them

1846.74 --> 1852.559
because that's what happens when you

1849.32 --> 1853.82
start to open doors that people can't

1852.559 --> 1856.1
handle

1853.82 --> 1858.74
the way to go is Derek to kind of keep

1856.1 --> 1864.2199999999998
them on the level they were

1858.74 --> 1864.22
to protect them from getting swept away

1865.88 --> 1871.7600000000002
and losing grounding losing the

1869.539 --> 1872.96
orientation of knowing where and what

1871.76 --> 1877.1
you are

1872.96 --> 1879.8600000000001
where to go is there to in a way

1877.1 --> 1881.899
keep you in the same place which is

1879.86 --> 1883.6399999999999
technically not even a bad thing it

1881.899 --> 1887.84
becomes a bad thing

1883.64 --> 1890.48
when you don't let it just keep you the

1887.84 --> 1893.0
way you are so that you can orientate

1890.48 --> 1895.3990000000001
but that it puts you in a cage and

1893.0 --> 1897.14
starts to dictate you on where you

1895.399 --> 1899.32
should go next that's when you got a

1897.14 --> 1899.3200000000002
problem

1905.6 --> 1912.399
and that's what the trolls are

1907.82 --> 1912.399
they let their wetigo dictate them

1912.44 --> 1917.5
they're defined by their way to go

1914.779 --> 1917.5
responses

1942.44 --> 1948.38
that's that's good DX I'm glad you

1945.32 --> 1951.86
realize that because it is

1948.38 --> 1955.5800000000002
right even when I go rage win

1951.86 --> 1959.799
it is wetigo but I do kind of like try

1955.58 --> 1959.799
to tame that Beast as it goes

1961.279 --> 1966.44
like I'm not letting wetty go fully

1963.44 --> 1971.2
destroy things I basically give it a pen

1966.44 --> 1971.2
a specific a specific place

1971.74 --> 1976.46
boundaries in which it can Roam and be

1974.96 --> 1979.3990000000001
wild like

1976.46 --> 1981.919
that's what I do with it

1979.399 --> 1984.9799999999998
Let It Go but I do give it like

1981.919 --> 1986.6000000000001
parameters as like this is you don't go

1984.98 --> 1988.64
there and you don't go there and you

1986.6 --> 1991.039
don't go there but yeah there's all

1988.64 --> 1993.5800000000002
these places that nobody dares to go you

1991.039 --> 1993.58
can go there

2013.98 --> 2019.6200000000001
yeah that's true Matthew Hall yeah that

2016.779 --> 2019.62
has happened before

2030.039 --> 2032.519
foreign

2058.72 --> 2065.7599999999998
think I just have dirt deficiency

2062.379 --> 2065.7599999999998
what makes you say that

2066.52 --> 2072.159
are you having like

2068.26 --> 2074.079
intestinal or stomach issues

2072.159 --> 2076.54
that don't seem to go away or you're

2074.079 --> 2079.54
handling tension not well reflecting it

2076.54 --> 2081.399
on those organs

2079.54 --> 2084.099
then I'd say you might have dirt

2081.399 --> 2086.2599999999998
deficiency because that's

2084.099 --> 2088.659
what was my case

2086.26 --> 2089.679
until I was reminded like wait I Got

2088.659 --> 2093.119
Dirt

2089.679 --> 2093.119
that actually works

2106.599 --> 2110.98
oh and also

2108.64 --> 2112.839
another reason why I want to call it

2110.98 --> 2115.3
dirt

2112.839 --> 2118.0
is it's also kind of a reference to

2115.3 --> 2121.0
Water World remember because in Water

2118.0 --> 2122.079
World dirt is the most precious resource

2121.0 --> 2124.26
they have

2122.079 --> 2124.26
foreign

2125.68 --> 2132.1189999999997
so I'm like a water world nobility I eat

2129.76 --> 2132.119
dirt

2132.16 --> 2137.94
that's crazy why would you eat dirt it's

2135.099 --> 2137.94
way too precious

2150.76 --> 2158.1600000000003
just a call back yeah but you know that

2154.8 --> 2162.3590000000004
superficial jokes always lead to

2158.16 --> 2162.359
elaborate detailed answers

2162.46 --> 2167.32
like as if it weren't just a superficial

2165.339 --> 2170.2799999999997
joke

2167.32 --> 2170.28
that's what I do

2174.099 --> 2179.32
it's like

2175.66 --> 2181.48
I'm oracling a basic remark for bigger

2179.32 --> 2183.76
meanings that the person as they

2181.48 --> 2186.46
inserted it didn't even realize that it

2183.76 --> 2189.96
could be in there

2186.46 --> 2189.96
that's what I like to do

2196.09 --> 2199.179
[Music]

2213.16 --> 2217.56
which you can see dirt to make eggshells

2215.38 --> 2217.56
yeah

2220.18 --> 2226.2599999999998
well I think technically you could eat

2223.06 --> 2226.2599999999998
egg shells but

2227.02 --> 2232.24
I don't know about that though

2229.9 --> 2235.0
but I mean they are at least very rich

2232.24 --> 2236.859
in calcium and minerals and

2235.0 --> 2239.26
you can also just put them in the

2236.859 --> 2240.7
compost or grind them up and put them on

2239.26 --> 2244.1800000000003
the ground I think that's pretty good

2240.7 --> 2245.68
for the for the

2244.18 --> 2248.5789999999997
for the ground if you're going to grow

2245.68 --> 2248.5789999999997
crops on it

2261.099 --> 2263.339
foreign

2271.14 --> 2275.6189999999997
ends up eating us all I like that that's

2274.3 --> 2278.04
great

2275.619 --> 2278.04
right

2279.43 --> 2292.56
[Music]

2295.79 --> 2298.989
[Music]

2305.26 --> 2307.26
um

2312.7 --> 2316.8999999999996
yeah Matthew well that's exactly what it

2315.04 --> 2319.3
feels like like it's balancing the

2316.9 --> 2322.98
acidity levels for some reason

2319.3 --> 2322.98
it and it works so well

2323.56 --> 2327.66
it works better than Tums

2330.64 --> 2334.66
it's just dirt

2332.38 --> 2338.44
it's like oh if the pharmaceutically

2334.66 --> 2341.44
make no it's just dirt

2338.44 --> 2344.619
just scooping the ground

2341.44 --> 2348.94
grind it up to a fine dust

2344.619 --> 2350.859
and that's the product no laboratory or

2348.94 --> 2353.38
anything or

2350.859 --> 2356.859
chemical station or anything like that

2353.38 --> 2360.2200000000003
required it's just dirt yeah we don't

2356.859 --> 2363.42
need all that [ __ ]

2360.22 --> 2363.4199999999996
just need dirt

2383.32 --> 2385.92
hmm

2396.76 --> 2401.28
yeah now colloidal silver is pretty cool

2402.76 --> 2408.78
I mean my ex used to have like a device

2406.0 --> 2408.78
to make it

2408.819 --> 2414.22
pretty

2410.619 --> 2417.06
I'm like kind of sad that I didn't

2414.22 --> 2417.06
take that

2421.42 --> 2426.7000000000003
because I do actually use Gloria silver

2423.88 --> 2428.56
or I used to use it a lot no I don't use

2426.7 --> 2432.22
it as much

2428.56 --> 2434.56
I still have some but I kind of like my

2432.22 --> 2437.56
entire View

2434.56 --> 2440.7999999999997
has shifted around right included silver

2437.56 --> 2443.5
was like ideal

2440.8 --> 2445.6600000000003
in the face of the idea that there is

2443.5 --> 2448.24
like these infectious things and all

2445.66 --> 2449.0789999999997
that those like antibacterial blah blah

2448.24 --> 2452.2
blah

2449.079 --> 2454.42
and now yeah since that time which is

2452.2 --> 2456.2799999999997
like roughly 10 years ago

2454.42 --> 2458.5
since that time I've kind of discovered

2456.28 --> 2460.5400000000004
other things like Germany medicine that

2458.5 --> 2463.0
give a whole new light on the situation

2460.54 --> 2463.9
and now it doesn't seem as urgent

2463.0 --> 2467.819
anymore

2463.9 --> 2467.819
but it's still very effective

2468.64 --> 2471.9
and overall good

2476.859 --> 2483.7
like colloidal silver for like burning

2480.099 --> 2486.28
wounds or something works great

2483.7 --> 2488.2
I get burnt quickly pour some colloidal

2486.28 --> 2490.6600000000003
silver on there take it like a Band-Aid

2488.2 --> 2493.7799999999997
or whatever douse it in colloidal silver

2490.66 --> 2496.0789999999997
put it on there it works it works really

2493.78 --> 2496.079
well

2503.619 --> 2508.6800000000003
not that I need to because I rarely get

2506.26 --> 2508.6800000000003
burned

2553.599 --> 2559.54
Jordan Luca no sorry

2556.78 --> 2560.8
I'm not very well aware of like the

2559.54 --> 2564.24
Dutch

2560.8 --> 2564.2400000000002
social media

2565.9 --> 2570.339
like what's going on out here

2568.48 --> 2573.04
I know there's a lot of Dutch people

2570.339 --> 2575.7
doing all kinds of things I don't really

2573.04 --> 2575.7
follow them

2584.3 --> 2587.4790000000003
[Music]

2592.44 --> 2597.2200000000003
you mean German new medicine not new

2595.359 --> 2600.46
German medicine

2597.22 --> 2602.4399999999996
German new medicine gnm

2600.46 --> 2603.64
right he had somebody on talking about

2602.44 --> 2605.5
that

2603.64 --> 2608.44
red voters

2605.5 --> 2611.56
people out there

2608.44 --> 2615.3
that do actually practice it

2611.56 --> 2615.2999999999997
that are also on media

2618.76 --> 2622.0200000000004
I've bumped into it before

2622.06 --> 2627.7599999999998
I think it's one point uh oh Benjamin

2625.359 --> 2629.0789999999997
was on with somebody

2627.76 --> 2631.1800000000003
like

2629.079 --> 2632.5
two other guys

2631.18 --> 2635.7999999999997
three

2632.5 --> 2638.44
in like a like a combined stream

2635.8 --> 2641.5600000000004
and there was they were German new

2638.44 --> 2644.2000000000003
medicine as well and talking about it

2641.56 --> 2648.24
that's from some time ago so they

2644.2 --> 2648.24
there's people out there like that

2667.54 --> 2672.72
okay Jeff gas said check it out what is

2670.54 --> 2672.72
that

2673.18 --> 2676.68
moon is flat

2679.78 --> 2682.8590000000004
what the

2687.099 --> 2690.839
what the hell is that

2696.94 --> 2700.26
what the hell

2707.319 --> 2712.14
that's

2708.64 --> 2712.14
it looks like it's

2712.18 --> 2718.5
rolling up like a scroll

2715.48 --> 2718.5
that's crazy

2727.24 --> 2732.64
like from the ISS that make that's kind

2730.06 --> 2735.18
of ridiculous though but

2732.64 --> 2735.18
weird

2771.339 --> 2778.9
yeah DX yeah Alpha Vedic kind of ring

2775.359 --> 2782.5
some Bells but look guys

2778.9 --> 2785.44
I've never been good in remembering the

2782.5 --> 2787.24
names of a whole bunch of people in the

2785.44 --> 2789.4
real world in the physical world

2787.24 --> 2791.56
face-to-face world right

2789.4 --> 2794.26
I'm not good at it either when it comes

2791.56 --> 2799.0
to oh do you know these

2794.26 --> 2801.6400000000003
10 000 different people online

2799.0 --> 2803.56
they're all kind of good and they're all

2801.64 --> 2807.22
doing their own thing separately do you

2803.56 --> 2810.099
know every single one of them no no I

2807.22 --> 2812.3799999999997
don't I can barely keep track of what's

2810.099 --> 2814.2400000000002
directly surrounding me I can barely

2812.38 --> 2816.4
keep track of the people that know me

2814.24 --> 2819.2999999999997
okay

2816.4 --> 2819.3
hahaha

2819.4 --> 2823.359
I

2821.2 --> 2826.8999999999996
if you're gonna ask me oh do you know

2823.359 --> 2830.04
this then that there's like a 98 chance

2826.9 --> 2830.04
the answer is no

2830.319 --> 2833.4
not always though

2843.579 --> 2850.6800000000003
yeah yeah that that video that Jeff gas

2846.339 --> 2850.68
had found was really weird

2855.46 --> 2859.619
I think I'm gonna post that

2861.76 --> 2866.28
in Skype it's pretty interesting

2881.02 --> 2886.44
but yeah again it's kind of like

2883.359 --> 2890.5
polluted because they said

2886.44 --> 2892.18
films natural satellite from ISS so

2890.5 --> 2894.4
they're immediately saying this is

2892.18 --> 2897.8799999999997
filmed from the ISS

2894.4 --> 2901.2400000000002
which technically makes it

2897.88 --> 2903.4
impossible because there is no ISS

2901.24 --> 2905.7999999999997
flying in the sky

2903.4 --> 2910.059
in order to film anything but whatever

2905.8 --> 2911.38
they use to trick all the footage in ISS

2910.059 --> 2914.92
projects

2911.38 --> 2916.6600000000003
well it might have actually caught

2914.92 --> 2921.599
this

2916.66 --> 2921.5989999999997
kind of like astronomical sighting

2922.54 --> 2927.22
so this might be actual footage based on

2925.599 --> 2930.099
a real observation

2927.22 --> 2932.7999999999997
but it's not from the ISS obviously

2930.099 --> 2937.7200000000003
because there is no ISS flying in the

2932.8 --> 2940.9
sky and that's a fact nobody ever

2937.72 --> 2943.18
can undo that fact that it isn't flying

2940.9 --> 2945.339
there because it can't and can it will

2943.18 --> 2947.7999999999997
never be able to

2945.339 --> 2951.22
and even if it could technically do that

2947.8 --> 2955.1400000000003
in some way it would never be worth it

2951.22 --> 2955.14
never ever be worth it

2960.7 --> 2964.66
because yeah

2962.68 --> 2966.8799999999997
why would you need to do that you're not

2964.66 --> 2969.22
going anywhere why would you need to be

2966.88 --> 2971.02
really high up there you're not going

2969.22 --> 2973.72
anywhere there's no other planets

2971.02 --> 2976.72
there's no other places can go further

2973.72 --> 2981.48
up and then reach another place that

2976.72 --> 2981.48
doesn't exist it never did never will

2987.9 --> 2991.159
[Music]

2993.94 --> 2999.78
Fe kitchen why why why would you want

2997.54 --> 2999.7799999999997

3000.9 --> 3003.619

3045.42 --> 3050.64
computer fixing

3048.0 --> 3053.16
and now the washing machine so I could

3050.64 --> 3055.5
definitely use it and yeah unfortunately

3053.16 --> 3058.7
on top of the regular support I need

3055.5 --> 3058.7
just to stay afloat

3059.94 --> 3064.619
so please do support me through the

3063.0 --> 3067.339
PayPal that would be really helpful

3064.619 --> 3067.339

3101.7 --> 3106.04
PayPal me Dash Arwin

3106.8 --> 3109.819
that works

3110.49 --> 3115.0789999999997
[Music]

3112.44 --> 3118.4
at least it used to work

3115.079 --> 3118.4
I think it still works

3146.579 --> 3151.38
I'm gonna get in a few months oh really

3149.099 --> 3154.38
you got your wife pregnant awesome

3151.38 --> 3154.38
congratulations

3156.78 --> 3162.42
but yeah maybe you shouldn't try to

3159.66 --> 3163.98
think like what kind of shows you want

3162.42 --> 3166.859
to show you're a really young kid maybe

3163.98 --> 3169.94
you just want to start out not showing

3166.859 --> 3169.94
them any screens

3170.579 --> 3177.92
and actually letting them focus more on

3173.16 --> 3177.92
face-to-face communication for a while

3178.2 --> 3183.24
right there they'll get to watching

3180.839 --> 3186.119
screens eventually

3183.24 --> 3189.6189999999997
so you might actually want to try to lay

3186.119 --> 3189.619
that off for as long as you can

3203.72 --> 3206.85
[Music]

3207.599 --> 3213.119
hey that flat fellow by the way

3210.78 --> 3215.8390000000004
yeah you said that earlier right right

3213.119 --> 3215.839
uh

3218.7 --> 3222.4399999999996
think of the letters kid show

3222.9 --> 3226.26
oh really

3224.28 --> 3228.3590000000004
I didn't even see that comment earlier

3226.26 --> 3232.28
sorry

3228.359 --> 3232.2799999999997
that our kitchen I haven't seen it

3234.85 --> 3237.909
[Music]

3324.059 --> 3326.8390000000004
all right

3332.4 --> 3339.799
yeah that was the

3335.099 --> 3339.799
those were the washing machine repairman

3390.359 --> 3394.859
yeah I guess that they're they're done

3392.52 --> 3396.839
pretty quickly

3394.859 --> 3401.88
although I

3396.839 --> 3404.46
I think I got like they were suggesting

3401.88 --> 3406.5
that there was an extra cost I'm really

3404.46 --> 3410.28
not happy about that if that's actually

3406.5 --> 3412.859
the case because I can't just like

3410.28 --> 3413.76
pump out another 300 Euros out of

3412.859 --> 3416.04
nowhere

3413.76 --> 3418.559
that's literally impossible

3416.04 --> 3421.16
that wasn't the deal

3418.559 --> 3421.1600000000003
so

3425.4 --> 3430.52
I hope this is not gonna turn into a

3427.5 --> 3430.52
disaster after all

3430.74 --> 3437.24
uh anyway I could definitely use the

3433.44 --> 3437.2400000000002
PayPal support now more than ever

3462.18 --> 3468.44
did they replace the lid switch I

3465.839 --> 3468.44
know

3496.26 --> 3501.7990000000004
but yeah guys like this is problematic

3502.26 --> 3510.7400000000002
I think so I really kind of need hey

3505.619 --> 3510.7400000000002
welcome back backs how much do I need

3519.319 --> 3522.619
in total

3533.04 --> 3543.38
right yeah uh in total dude

3537.96 --> 3543.38
I can't say it's like 200 Euros

3555.0 --> 3561.0
but yeah the issue is this is gonna like

3558.24 --> 3564.319
not sit well with my roommates

3561.0 --> 3564.319
that's the bigger problem

3574.079 --> 3579.059
all right but anyway yeah guys if

3576.9 --> 3582.059
anybody can

3579.059 --> 3585.619
actually helped me out that would be

3582.059 --> 3585.619
that would kind of fix everything

3592.2 --> 3597.299
why he's not landlord not fake because

3594.42 --> 3600.26
then the rent would go up

3597.299 --> 3600.2599999999998
it's not his

3624.78 --> 3631.46
man they were quick by the way because

3627.059 --> 3631.46
that was like really quick

3639.0 --> 3643.859
I'm gonna hook you up tomorrow and get

3640.799 --> 3647.18
that would be awesome flutter Sage I

3643.859 --> 3647.18

because yeah if I don't get some

3650.94 --> 3655.7400000000002

I hope it's worth it and

3768.48 --> 3771.14

what

3941.28 --> 3947.1600000000003
I am po

3944.099 --> 3949.94
but not forever what does that mean

3947.16 --> 3949.94
Adam Price

3969.18 --> 3974.0989999999997
oh you're poor

3971.4 --> 3976.6800000000003
right

3974.099 --> 3977.94
yeah well if you can help out that's

3976.68 --> 3979.5589999999997
okay

3977.94 --> 3982.819
right

3979.559 --> 3982.8190000000004
it's only if you can

3986.7 --> 3991.68
thank you very much guns

3989.4 --> 3994.4
it's slang for poor okay I didn't

3991.68 --> 3994.3999999999996
realize that

4000.4 --> 4004.1800000000003
all right so

4009.68 --> 4013.359
what else to talk about

4022.22 --> 4027.98
we got a little less than 20 minutes

4025.4 --> 4031.039
and I'm probably gonna be spending half

4027.98 --> 4034.359
the Flat Earth debates like dealing with

4031.039 --> 4034.3590000000004
the washing machine again

4043.579 --> 4046.119
all right

4072.13 --> 4075.2090000000003
[Music]

4081.98 --> 4087.28
yeah by the way my subscribers keep on

4084.319 --> 4087.2799999999997
swinging it's weird

4090.559 --> 4098.0
it's like going up and down between 21

4093.68 --> 4101.259
20 and 21 30.

4098.0 --> 4101.259
don't know what's going on

4113.42 --> 4118.64
oh God if I heard of that dude

4123.799 --> 4129.04
I wish I hadn't

4125.659 --> 4129.04
it's really gross

4151.819 --> 4154.959000000001
[Music]

4186.319 --> 4192.219
sent another 10 what again

4189.04 --> 4192.219
thank you

4195.02 --> 4197.860000000001
wow

4212.38 --> 4216.58
don't worry about the Caps dude

4222.56 --> 4229.04
just so odd video

4225.679 --> 4232.159
on nearly oh God

4229.04 --> 4234.38
oh odd video right yeah well don't watch

4232.159 --> 4238.599999999999
that then

4234.38 --> 4241.52
so I'll just gross obsession with like

4238.6 --> 4243.56
demonic Arts

4241.52 --> 4246.14
like things that nobody should know

4243.56 --> 4247.76
about yeah yeah that's why you shouldn't

4246.14 --> 4249.4400000000005
dwell there because then you get

4247.76 --> 4252.9800000000005
obsessed with that and every word that

4249.44 --> 4255.259999999999
comes out of you is it a gross atrocity

4252.98 --> 4257.12
that nobody you're talking to actually

4255.26 --> 4260.0
deserves the hair

4257.12 --> 4262.5199999999995
that's what happens

4260.0 --> 4263.6
that's why I just never talk about it

4262.52 --> 4265.64
ever

4263.6 --> 4268.9400000000005
because

4265.64 --> 4270.7390000000005
I want that to be erased and that

4268.94 --> 4273.62
includes from the minds and you don't

4270.739 --> 4275.9
erase it from happening by letting

4273.62 --> 4279.4
everybody know it exists

4275.9 --> 4279.4
that's not how that works

4294.5 --> 4300.76
thermal acoustic engine

4298.1 --> 4300.76
huh

4303.32 --> 4307.96
wait what

4304.82 --> 4307.96
how does that work

4337.28 --> 4340.699
huh

4339.739 --> 4342.86
okay

4340.699 --> 4346.599999999999
oh that's not his video by the way

4342.86 --> 4346.599999999999
that's just in his playlist

4348.02 --> 4350.92
interesting

4362.48 --> 4365.0199999999995
weird

4368.36 --> 4371.679
thermal acoustics

4372.38 --> 4376.88
okay well that looks at least

4374.42 --> 4379.78
interesting to look into at some point

4376.88 --> 4379.78
huh

4412.159 --> 4416.42
yeah Adam Price yeah yeah I yeah that

4415.1 --> 4418.46
was a good moment

4416.42 --> 4423.219
yeah

4418.46 --> 4423.219
yeah the anti-flat Earth are trying to

4424.28 --> 4428.62
play us

4425.719 --> 4428.62
it's ridiculous

4447.44 --> 4452.5599999999995
climatics as a former future entity

4450.02 --> 4452.56
production

4460.94 --> 4464.44
I didn't know about that

4465.38 --> 4469.84
but who knows what's possible out there

4472.219 --> 4477.02
I'm not really like a super engineer

4474.92 --> 4479.84
that's always trying to figure out new

4477.02 --> 4482.3
ways to do that but pretty sure that the

4479.84 --> 4485.3
possibilities are vast

4482.3 --> 4485.3
overall

4545.78 --> 4550.159
oh yeah

4547.34 --> 4554.38
I gotta mention that

4550.159 --> 4554.379999999999
Michael Khan had a hilarious video

4562.88 --> 4568.219
of going out for groceries what's that

4565.82 --> 4569.9
like what that's like in this day's day

4568.219 --> 4572.3
and age

4569.9 --> 4575.54
I'll link you up to that

4572.3 --> 4579.219
it's a silly video but

4575.54 --> 4579.219
thought it was very entertaining

4581.3 --> 4583.3
um

4625.34 --> 4629.06
right but I think I'm gonna round out

4627.32 --> 4631.599999999999
the show

4629.06 --> 4634.219
I'm not super

4631.6 --> 4636.1990000000005
inspired right now although I think it's

4634.219 --> 4639.92
still

4636.199 --> 4642.0199999999995
decent conversations here and there

4639.92 --> 4644.84
I'm just really distracted by the whole

4642.02 --> 4646.88
washing machine situation

4644.84 --> 4650.179
I'm gonna have to lift that thing again

4646.88 --> 4653.4800000000005
I think I hope not really I hope this

4650.179 --> 4656.02
time they're gonna actually do it

4653.48 --> 4656.0199999999995
huh

4661.34 --> 4669.52
and watch the third phase of the moon of

4665.9 --> 4669.5199999999995
moon occasionally okay

4673.52 --> 4677.2390000000005
and stated aliens are in fact extra

4675.5 --> 4680.38
Dimension not physically yeah the world

4677.239 --> 4680.379999999999
has been saying that for years

4681.62 --> 4684.4
because it is

4688.04 --> 4695.199
they're basically Spirit entities not

4691.58 --> 4695.199
actual physical beings

4710.06 --> 4715.280000000001
but yeah interesting to hear more people

4712.46 --> 4717.44
talk about that

4715.28 --> 4721.099999999999
it's kind of been spreading for a while

4717.44 --> 4724.48
now that conception and Alex Jones also

4721.1 --> 4724.4800000000005
have been like harping on it

4725.6 --> 4729.280000000001
for a couple of years already

4730.28 --> 4732.5199999999995
foreign

4768.92 --> 4773.36
evil spirits trapped in biomech suits

4772.159 --> 4776.92
that's

4773.36 --> 4776.92
it's a bit far-fetched

4779.9 --> 4785.36
but maybe

4782.42 --> 4788.679
but yeah who's made that right who's

4785.36 --> 4788.679
been making those suits then

4794.54 --> 4800.3
like they cannot make them they cannot

4797.96 --> 4802.88
make it themselves somebody

4800.3 --> 4806.4800000000005
in the physical world would have had to

4802.88 --> 4809.62
made those suits

4806.48 --> 4809.62
well who did that

4842.48 --> 4846.678999999999
just thinking of a possibility right

4845.06 --> 4849.04
well you're not the first one to think

4846.679 --> 4849.04
of that

4852.32 --> 4855.58
but yeah

4856.4 --> 4861.94
they cannot just Spirits can't just make

4859.58 --> 4861.94
things

4862.699 --> 4867.82
something else has to make it for them

4864.86 --> 4867.82
in the physical world

4882.02 --> 4888.26
right anyway I'm gonna run out so thanks

4885.679 --> 4889.639
everybody for coming I hope you like

4888.26 --> 4891.4400000000005
this show

4889.639 --> 4894.62
thought it was okay

4891.44 --> 4898.638999999999
a bit slow Maybe

4894.62 --> 4899.84
but uh yeah I'll get back to speed soon
