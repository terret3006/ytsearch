another day

93.68 --> 97.36000000000001
kind of a gray day again it's

98.0 --> 102.799
been very similar weather for the last

100.24 --> 104.399
uh half week

102.799 --> 106.96000000000001
kind of boring

104.399 --> 106.96000000000001
clouded

110.479 --> 116.64
no wind does seem to be a lot of moist

112.96 --> 116.64
in the air right now over here but

117.6 --> 122.96
yeah

119.119 --> 122.96
it's not very sunny sunday

124.88 --> 128.04
all right

134.72 --> 137.2
so

137.28 --> 144.52
yeah

138.48 --> 144.51999999999998
it is sunday the 23rd of january 2022

148.48 --> 152.39999999999998
let's see what i'm gonna talk about

150.16 --> 153.92
today

152.4 --> 157.84
i'm not as

153.92 --> 157.83999999999997
hyped up as i was yesterday

158.08 --> 162.0
i did go to bed pretty early and

163.2 --> 167.2
yeah

164.959 --> 168.959
eat more dirt i'm gonna eat some more

167.2 --> 172.07999999999998
dirt right after this right because

168.959 --> 175.92000000000002
maybe it'll do something good

172.08 --> 175.92000000000002
it hasn't done any bad so far

176.48 --> 181.92
it's almost like a little bit of dirt

178.48 --> 181.92
with air fixes everything

182.72 --> 185.8
all right

185.84 --> 190.239
maybe that's also why

188.08 --> 192.87900000000002
some really fanatic organic eating

190.239 --> 195.04
people they don't want their vegetables

192.879 --> 198.879
washed

195.04 --> 200.159
they like the dirt nah probably not but

198.879 --> 201.599
it's

200.159 --> 203.92
a thought

201.599 --> 203.92
right

204.08 --> 209.20000000000002
but yeah also

205.92 --> 213.11999999999998
i had a like a really

209.2 --> 216.0
just an unpleasant dream this night

213.12 --> 218.64000000000001
wouldn't say a nightmare but

216.0 --> 220.799
because there was not no real death or

218.64 --> 224.159
anything involved

220.799 --> 226.4
but it was certainly scary

224.159 --> 230.48
and that did give me like just a very

226.4 --> 230.48000000000002
unpleasant feeling when i woke up

231.12 --> 236.959
it's a weird dream

234.08 --> 236.959
basically dreamt

237.84 --> 241.28
like

238.959 --> 242.879
me and some other people

241.28 --> 244.799
friends

242.879 --> 248.07999999999998
colleagues or something

244.799 --> 250.31900000000002
or in a very big building

248.08 --> 253.20000000000002
and then basically

250.319 --> 255.2
well what was kind of identified as a

253.2 --> 256.959
foreign army

255.2 --> 259.199
just kind of

256.959 --> 261.199
started attacking

259.199 --> 263.36
i think it was probably like

261.199 --> 266.08000000000004
supposed to represent the russians or

263.36 --> 267.36
the chinese or something i couldn't even

266.08 --> 269.44
like

267.36 --> 271.84000000000003
i didn't even like spot

269.44 --> 274.0
soldier faces to really make out the

271.84 --> 276.23999999999995
difference it seems more like it was

274.0 --> 277.36
like an entire straw man thing it wasn't

276.24 --> 279.84000000000003
like a

277.36 --> 282.24
ominous warning it was more like

279.84 --> 285.35999999999996
a symbol

282.24 --> 287.6
and yeah nobody was getting killed

285.36 --> 287.6
but

287.919 --> 292.35999999999996
it seemed like

290.72 --> 294.47900000000004
there was no

292.36 --> 296.72
counter-military force or something

294.479 --> 300.56
doing anything to stop it

296.72 --> 303.12
and they yeah they came in with tanks

300.56 --> 304.56
and soldiers but it was mostly tanks and

303.12 --> 306.72
soldiers

304.56 --> 309.199
really big freaking tanks too

306.72 --> 312.32000000000005
that would just start

309.199 --> 314.0
like leveling the building as people

312.32 --> 316.479
were still in it

314.0 --> 318.96
and didn't really crash down on anybody

316.479 --> 320.88
it was almost like

318.96 --> 324.08
gi joe

320.88 --> 326.639
a team style in that literally nobody

324.08 --> 329.12
got killed and and i paid it i don't

326.639 --> 331.44
know why i do that in my dream it's like

329.12 --> 333.36
analyzing a movie i paid attention

331.44 --> 336.08
nobody got killed

333.36 --> 337.759
but they were all like

336.08 --> 341.12
getting corralled

337.759 --> 343.28000000000003
and just pushed to like the inner part

341.12 --> 344.88
or the inner garden of the people and

343.28 --> 347.039
then eventually that's where the dream

344.88 --> 350.15999999999997
also ended when i arrived there

347.039 --> 351.52
there was like really surreal

350.16 --> 354.8
there were

351.52 --> 356.31899999999996
police officers fully dressed up really

354.8 --> 357.6
tidy

356.319 --> 359.44
and they were just

357.6 --> 362.08000000000004
standing there

359.44 --> 364.0
and they i could see their faces and

362.08 --> 366.15999999999997
they all like didn't really know what to

364.0 --> 368.56
do they were really nervous just like

366.16 --> 369.44
standing by

368.56 --> 372.639
because

369.44 --> 375.039
they were not like

372.639 --> 376.08
instructed to do anything apparently nor

375.039 --> 378.24
were they

376.08 --> 380.96
did they have any plans for this

378.24 --> 385.36
scenario that was unfolding

380.96 --> 385.35999999999996
so it was kind of an airy experience

388.16 --> 391.03900000000004
and

389.199 --> 393.039
to metaphorically describe it really

391.039 --> 395.84
felt like we were being corralled like

393.039 --> 395.84
animals

396.24 --> 398.16
with

397.28 --> 400.63899999999995
well

398.16 --> 402.40000000000003
nobody was getting killed

400.639 --> 405.039
so it wasn't like oh no we're going to

402.4 --> 406.08
get exterminated it wasn't that type of

405.039 --> 407.919
dream

406.08 --> 409.919
nobody was getting killed but we were

407.919 --> 412.4
getting like forced

409.919 --> 414.56
to move

412.4 --> 416.79999999999995
and they literally just trashed the

414.56 --> 417.52
building which was a really big building

416.8 --> 420.52000000000004
like

417.52 --> 420.52
multi-compartment

420.84 --> 425.11999999999995
high

422.479 --> 427.039
high room buildings

425.12 --> 429.599
and some smaller room build it was a

427.039 --> 431.599
pretty big complex not like a

429.599 --> 433.44
high rise or anything

431.599 --> 434.639
but a pretty big complex and it was just

433.44 --> 436.96
getting

434.639 --> 439.759
trashed

436.96 --> 442.0
like literally they just drove

439.759 --> 443.759
right through the walls and even like

442.0 --> 445.919
the the pillars

443.759 --> 448.40000000000003
the buildings and just made it made

445.919 --> 450.79999999999995
parts of it come down and all that

448.4 --> 453.84
didn't overrun anybody though

450.8 --> 456.16
that i could see like the

453.84 --> 458.0
the technical like if there was a real

456.16 --> 459.84000000000003
situation that's very likely to have

458.0 --> 462.24
happened when you just crash in a wall

459.84 --> 463.44
with a tank yeah you do actually get

462.24 --> 466.0
people killed

463.44 --> 467.919
but i could not see i did not see a one

466.0 --> 469.919
spatter of blood in it

467.919 --> 471.44
weird dream

469.919 --> 473.039
ominous

471.44 --> 475.199
but not

473.039 --> 476.31899999999996
like terrifying

475.199 --> 479.599
weird

476.319 --> 480.96000000000004
anyway hello road man proof

479.599 --> 483.28
agm

480.96 --> 483.28
bex

483.759 --> 487.52000000000004
tanks are just toys air power

487.68 --> 490.24
yeah

488.56 --> 493.199
well aj i'm not

490.24 --> 494.16
saying that this was like a realistic

493.199 --> 496.40000000000003
dream

494.16 --> 498.47900000000004
right there were obvious

496.4 --> 501.28
traits missing like if something is a

498.479 --> 503.84
lucid dream

501.28 --> 505.11999999999995
you can actually see every detail you

503.84 --> 507.039
can see

505.12 --> 510.0
the faces you can

507.039 --> 512.08
figure out where are these people from

510.0 --> 513.279
all that

512.08 --> 515.039
right

513.279 --> 518.32
so it was more like a symbolic

515.039 --> 518.3199999999999
representation i think

518.399 --> 522.479
i still saw a lot of details for just

520.88 --> 524.0
from the building

522.479 --> 525.279
and like

524.0 --> 527.04
before

525.279 --> 529.2
they eventually started crashing down

527.04 --> 530.7199999999999
the building i had been like all over

529.2 --> 535.08
the building

530.72 --> 535.08
i was actually kind of like

536.16 --> 540.24
guiding some girl

537.839 --> 542.32
which kind of resembled like it was my

540.24 --> 544.32
ex-girlfriend but it wasn't

542.32 --> 546.48
didn't feel like that

544.32 --> 548.8000000000001
was almost like a simulacrum of her or

546.48 --> 550.64
something it wasn't really her and it

548.8 --> 552.16
was showing her around the building

550.64 --> 554.399
going all over the place going up

552.16 --> 556.8
staircases and

554.399 --> 557.839
and then eventually

556.8 --> 559.76
like

557.839 --> 562.0
the military that

559.76 --> 564.88
invading military and the tanks were

562.0 --> 566.64
already visible outside of the building

564.88 --> 569.36
surrounding it

566.64 --> 572.3199999999999
and also helicopters and all that

569.36 --> 572.32
dropping troops

574.72 --> 578.08
and the first day kind of surrounded

576.48 --> 579.839
everybody got a little nervous and then

578.08 --> 582.24
they just started driving through the

579.839 --> 582.24
walls

582.72 --> 585.9200000000001
i don't even know what they were doing

584.16 --> 588.8
there if they were like looking for some

585.92 --> 591.5999999999999
specific individual or

588.8 --> 595.4399999999999
it it was really surreal it wasn't like

591.6 --> 595.44
a lucid dream thank god

595.68 --> 600.279
right hey jeff gas head

605.04 --> 610.24
right so that got me a bit spooked in

607.839 --> 613.12
the morning don't feel like yesterday it

610.24 --> 615.36
was just so much energy it felt really

613.12 --> 618.079
strong

615.36 --> 621.6800000000001
i had a good show yesterday

618.079 --> 621.68
longest one this month

624.88 --> 629.279
all right

626.8 --> 632.279
so yeah that dream happened

629.279 --> 632.279
weird

634.56 --> 636.88
uh

643.04 --> 648.88
where's this

645.519 --> 652.72
yeah i i bumped into one video

648.88 --> 652.72
let me try to find it back where is it

652.8 --> 656.959
a re-upload

654.56 --> 660.64
channel called paul cook

656.959 --> 662.56
uploaded it from michelle gibson

660.64 --> 664.48
and that

662.56 --> 666.7199999999999
i think it's a concept that has been

664.48 --> 669.12
around already there for a while but

666.72 --> 672.399
this video was like

669.12 --> 672.399
shockingly detailed

672.959 --> 677.76
and

674.399 --> 681.04
it's almost like well it had like the

677.76 --> 684.56
kind of break open feel of no trees on

681.04 --> 687.36
flat earth right no forest

684.56 --> 689.1199999999999
that story laying down like how things

687.36 --> 693.36
were different well this

689.12 --> 693.36
is called circuit board earth

693.92 --> 701.279
and it really does make you think

696.72 --> 703.9200000000001
because it's basically about how

701.279 --> 706.8
the earth might already been

703.92 --> 709.5999999999999
architecturally rearranged

706.8 --> 713.5999999999999
probably in the tartarian age

709.6 --> 715.12
to be a fully electrical society

713.6 --> 718.0790000000001
and that

715.12 --> 721.2
just watch the video and like

718.079 --> 724.7199999999999
i'm not saying like oh this is it guys

721.2 --> 726.399
but it's like there's enough there to

724.72 --> 729.2
really make you think

726.399 --> 729.2
like hmm

729.519 --> 734.8
like at least partially there is very

731.92 --> 737.8389999999999
likely to be something to this

734.8 --> 737.8389999999999
it's fascinating

739.44 --> 743.6800000000001
like certain patterns

741.92 --> 748.4799999999999
that can be found

743.68 --> 752.3199999999999
that do not seem to be really natural

748.48 --> 755.2
and for some re are probably man-made

752.32 --> 756.88
in the far past

755.2 --> 759.839
and everything has been kind of like

756.88 --> 762.88
been breaking down and removed all these

759.839 --> 765.7600000000001
yeah this video is full of

762.88 --> 767.36
basically showing examples of buildings

765.76 --> 770.24
massive buildings

767.36 --> 773.519
that were built and then like

770.24 --> 775.839
really really quickly demolished again

773.519 --> 779.36
for no logical reason

775.839 --> 781.839
just destroyed just like that

779.36 --> 781.839
crazy

781.92 --> 787.279
like there's even like this really

784.72 --> 790.9590000000001
super curious looking building in new

787.279 --> 792.24
york like a very small but super high

790.959 --> 796.16
building

792.24 --> 798.639
that only stood there for seven years

796.16 --> 800.48
before they demolished it like

798.639 --> 802.88
what

800.48 --> 802.88
why

803.04 --> 805.92
really bizarre

804.959 --> 808.2399999999999
like

805.92 --> 810.959
i knew some things had been like trashed

808.24 --> 814.399
and all that and the chicago

810.959 --> 817.04
fair thing and all that

814.399 --> 819.44
but this like is really like putting

817.04 --> 821.92
numbers to like buildings claims of when

819.44 --> 824.639
they were being erected and then they

821.92 --> 827.36
were demolished again like

824.639 --> 830.88
not even a century later just not even a

827.36 --> 832.5600000000001
decade later sometimes it's crazy

830.88 --> 834.88
like

832.56 --> 835.76
makes no logical sense unless they were

834.88 --> 839.519
well

835.76 --> 839.519
trying to disrupt the circuit

839.76 --> 845.6
the tartarians had built a circuit

842.959 --> 846.6389999999999
they had built a foundation a

845.6 --> 849.76
a

846.639 --> 851.92
a motherboard they'd build a motherboard

849.76 --> 855.199
out of earth that's a good comparison

851.92 --> 857.519
they built a motherboard out of earth

855.199 --> 860.24
using everything using its natural

857.519 --> 862.399
workings like utilizing the natural

860.24 --> 864.8
welling up of energy

862.399 --> 866.32
and optimizing it and enhancing it like

864.8 --> 869.68
a circuit board

866.32 --> 871.12
it's really mind-blowing

869.68 --> 873.4399999999999
and yeah

871.12 --> 875.199
elise came in

873.44 --> 877.2790000000001
and they trashed it they took it away

875.199 --> 878.16
they took the energy away

877.279 --> 880.959
because

878.16 --> 883.04
then the yeah the rubber barons

880.959 --> 885.5999999999999
took over they needed

883.04 --> 888.3199999999999
everybody to become dependent

885.6 --> 888.32
on their

888.72 --> 891.519
resources

890.399 --> 895.04
instead of

891.519 --> 895.04
utilizing this natural

895.199 --> 900.56
circuit energy

897.839 --> 901.6800000000001
i thought it was worthy

900.56 --> 904.2399999999999
at least

901.68 --> 906.6389999999999
considering at least watching once and

904.24 --> 909.6
thinking about it not saying this is all

906.639 --> 911.44
it guys but it is

909.6 --> 914.32
really fascinating

911.44 --> 916.1600000000001
and it's it's worth remembering

914.32 --> 917.6800000000001
like even if it's not literally that

916.16 --> 919.4399999999999
there is something about like the

917.68 --> 920.7199999999999
architectural

919.44 --> 922.32
layout

920.72 --> 924.32
it's almost you could compare it to like

922.32 --> 925.7600000000001
feng shui or something

924.32 --> 927.839
right

925.76 --> 930.48
the tartarians were arranging things in

927.839 --> 935.0400000000001
a way that they knew worked

930.48 --> 936.48
and then it was disrupted on purpose

935.04 --> 938.399
and that is

936.48 --> 940.8000000000001
whether you think it was literal circuit

938.399 --> 942.56
board earth or something

940.8 --> 944.959
that formula

942.56 --> 946.2399999999999
is very likely to be true one way or the

944.959 --> 948.2399999999999
other

946.24 --> 951.519
so yeah definitely worth watching that

948.24 --> 951.519
video check it out

952.399 --> 958.24
oh i give you the quick link by the way

956.16 --> 959.8389999999999
it's not like from the original channel

958.24 --> 962.88
although in the description box of the

959.839 --> 965.1990000000001
video a link to the original is there i

962.88 --> 967.92
also subscribe to her

965.199 --> 969.7589999999999
don't know what other content she has

967.92 --> 970.8
but i thought that this video was really

969.759 --> 974.8000000000001
amazing

970.8 --> 974.8
definitely worth watching at least once

978.399 --> 981.399
right

986.72 --> 991.36
i think i could actually pump high

988.24 --> 994.36
enough voltage through it

991.36 --> 994.36
ah

997.12 --> 1000.0
yeah

998.639 --> 1003.279
i don't know

1000.0 --> 1006.519
i'm not an electric technical engineer

1003.279 --> 1006.519
hey crockett

1018.56 --> 1022.3599999999999
let's get some dirt

1031.76 --> 1035.76
right but it also indicated that

1036.64 --> 1041.3600000000001
there was it just really seems like it

1040.4 --> 1043.199
guys

1041.36 --> 1044.8799999999999
it's already i've already had hints like

1043.199 --> 1046.88
even through like martin luther's

1044.88 --> 1050.24
presentations and all that

1046.88 --> 1050.24
it really seems like

1050.96 --> 1054.64
the 19th century

1054.72 --> 1059.84
was an electrical age they had actually

1061.039 --> 1066.72
electrical devices

1063.919 --> 1069.679
electrical

1066.72 --> 1069.679
well lines

1071.039 --> 1074.72
and electrical vehicles

1075.039 --> 1078.4
and

1075.84 --> 1081.1999999999998
like power generators like

1078.4 --> 1083.52
what do you call them

1081.2 --> 1085.76
you know

1083.52 --> 1086.8799999999999
uh big dynamos

1085.76 --> 1089.039
and all that

1086.88 --> 1092.64
that are typically used for charging

1089.039 --> 1094.24
power stations they existed like way

1092.64 --> 1098.0800000000002
back

1094.24 --> 1101.36
not like oh early 20th century no no

1098.08 --> 1101.36
19th century

1103.6 --> 1109.12
just fully

1105.679 --> 1110.48
el electro yeah electrical

1109.12 --> 1113.12
grids

1110.48 --> 1115.52
and they weren't like used for for like

1113.12 --> 1118.4799999999998
equipment that we have now and all that

1115.52 --> 1119.84
now they were mostly just used

1118.48 --> 1123.84
for

1119.84 --> 1126.24
yeah electro motor driven vehicles

1123.84 --> 1128.799
and such things and pumps

1126.24 --> 1130.88
right for big machines

1128.799 --> 1134.0
that's what they use the power for not

1130.88 --> 1136.72
for little devices for every individual

1134.0 --> 1140.08
like we do today

1136.72 --> 1141.3600000000001
but it was there and it was vast

1140.08 --> 1143.9189999999999
and efficient

1141.36 --> 1145.6789999999999
they had a lot of

1143.919 --> 1150.6000000000001
these circuits

1145.679 --> 1150.6000000000001
like multiple places in the world

1150.64 --> 1155.8400000000001
london underground was probably

1153.12 --> 1158.32
like an electric

1155.84 --> 1161.52
was yeah was an electric

1158.32 --> 1164.84
metro station system

1161.52 --> 1164.84
in the 1900s

1164.96 --> 1170.24
and then they just like oh no no it goes

1167.36 --> 1173.28
away and oh oh now we got

1170.24 --> 1175.52
now we got like uh

1173.28 --> 1175.52
yeah

1176.16 --> 1178.64
gas and

1177.6 --> 1181.28
fuel

1178.64 --> 1183.2
based trains and all that which is like

1181.28 --> 1185.76
totally inefficient for the entire

1183.2 --> 1188.0800000000002
design of it

1185.76 --> 1188.96
so yeah that the video really laid it

1188.08 --> 1192.24
out

1188.96 --> 1194.0
check it out

1192.24 --> 1195.76
it'll blow your mind

1194.0 --> 1198.32
if you haven't bumped into anything like

1195.76 --> 1198.32
that before

1200.72 --> 1205.24
right

1202.24 --> 1205.24
anyway

1217.84 --> 1221.12
right it's been watching some home

1219.44 --> 1224.159
benjamin

1221.12 --> 1224.1589999999999
very interesting

1227.679 --> 1231.919
like his friday show from the watico is

1230.48 --> 1233.3600000000001
very

1231.919 --> 1235.8400000000001
intense and

1233.36 --> 1235.84
revealing

1237.12 --> 1241.84
it's really all about the demon on the

1239.6 --> 1244.08
inside and that we all struggle with and

1241.84 --> 1248.0
you can never that struggle can never

1244.08 --> 1249.84
end if you think it ends it wins

1248.0 --> 1251.84
it really is the devil that tried to

1249.84 --> 1254.6399999999999
convince you it didn't exist and it's in

1251.84 --> 1256.08
every one of us pretty much

1254.64 --> 1259.2
and we can

1256.08 --> 1261.039
and we have to learn to deal with it one

1259.2 --> 1263.44
way or the other

1261.039 --> 1266.48
was a really good show

1263.44 --> 1269.76
and i pretty much am yeah in agreement

1266.48 --> 1269.76
with everything he said there

1269.84 --> 1273.039
right

1270.799 --> 1274.84
and other than that

1273.039 --> 1278.48
what

1274.84 --> 1280.559
else all right news is apparently going

1278.48 --> 1281.76
around that the entire

1280.559 --> 1285.039
sea

1281.76 --> 1286.8799999999999
maybe can i just say it again

1285.039 --> 1289.84
that the entire

1286.88 --> 1290.88
medical agenda that's been plaguing the

1289.84 --> 1293.36
world

1290.88 --> 1296.7990000000002
with its policies in the last two years

1293.36 --> 1299.6
is coming to an end for real this time

1296.799 --> 1301.2
on a on a big scale like not just

1299.6 --> 1303.28
sporadically

1301.2 --> 1306.159
getting a lot of signs from a lot of

1303.28 --> 1306.1589999999999
news sources

1306.64 --> 1312.24
and they're all saying it

1308.64 --> 1314.5590000000002
and or alex jones is already doing like

1312.24 --> 1316.24
his prediction thing he's saying like

1314.559 --> 1319.039
yeah that's only temporary they're gonna

1316.24 --> 1320.32
come back with something even worse

1319.039 --> 1322.0
they're going to give us some peace then

1320.32 --> 1323.52
we'll get used to the piece and then

1322.0 --> 1325.039
they're going to break in again and it

1323.52 --> 1327.28
makes perfect sense that's what they

1325.039 --> 1328.24
would do if they got something

1327.28 --> 1329.28
right

1328.24 --> 1331.1200000000001
or

1329.28 --> 1334.3999999999999
they're going to just create more ruckus

1331.12 --> 1335.9189999999999
in another way and yeah that could mean

1334.4 --> 1338.5590000000002
like basically

1335.919 --> 1340.7990000000002
creating a war with russia

1338.559 --> 1343.36
with which would be triggered by the us

1340.799 --> 1343.36
and europe

1343.44 --> 1348.88
right

1344.32 --> 1348.8799999999999
just nagging poking that bear endlessly

1353.919 --> 1359.96
but yeah it seems like maybe it's really

1356.64 --> 1359.96
done now

1363.84 --> 1368.6399999999999
maybe they finally got the hint this is

1365.679 --> 1371.2800000000002
not gonna work we're just gonna

1368.64 --> 1373.8400000000001
end up dragging you out of your houses

1371.28 --> 1375.52
and then ripping you apart they're bare

1373.84 --> 1377.1999999999998
hands if we need to

1375.52 --> 1378.799
that's how that's going to end if you

1377.2 --> 1382.159
keep pushing it and i think that they

1378.799 --> 1385.96
might have finally gotten the hint

1382.159 --> 1385.96
that that's not a bluff

1392.72 --> 1396.96
huh lol

1394.64 --> 1400.76
somebody's jealous how many shows do you

1396.96 --> 1400.76
have tiger lily

1404.4 --> 1407.679
right

1405.36 --> 1409.84
and how many people

1407.679 --> 1410.64
quote you

1409.84 --> 1413.52
ah

1410.64 --> 1414.48
how many people quote you on the scene

1413.52 --> 1418.4
right

1414.48 --> 1418.4
how many people even know who you are

1426.159 --> 1431.4
i mean you literally have zero

1428.4 --> 1431.4
subscribers

1433.76 --> 1438.08
and no content

1435.6 --> 1441.12
so what did you ever do

1438.08 --> 1444.12
right i'm very happy with my 2.12 k

1441.12 --> 1444.12
subscribers

1446.32 --> 1451.36
i don't need my room to be buzzing with

1449.6 --> 1452.8799999999999
a whole bunch of people that are just

1451.36 --> 1454.9599999999998
blabbering and not really paying

1452.88 --> 1456.72
attention anyway i like people that pay

1454.96 --> 1458.4
attention

1456.72 --> 1461.279
i kick

1458.4 --> 1463.679
people that just waste space i kick them

1461.279 --> 1466.64
out that's what i do i like my

1463.679 --> 1469.44
subscriber account being this low i mean

1466.64 --> 1472.3200000000002
i wouldn't mind if it would grow bigger

1469.44 --> 1474.96
if that gave me some kind of a benefit

1472.32 --> 1478.48
but my ultimate goal is to actually

1474.96 --> 1479.76
contribute on an intellectual level

1478.48 --> 1480.64
and then

1479.76 --> 1482.32
yeah

1480.64 --> 1485.2
if i did well

1482.32 --> 1487.279
my name will be referenced by people

1485.2 --> 1490.6000000000001
that matter

1487.279 --> 1490.6
and they do

1508.159 --> 1515.8400000000001
hey thank you thomas larson that's an

1510.4 --> 1515.8400000000001
interesting factoid there cool

1516.96 --> 1520.32
oh

1517.84 --> 1521.4399999999998
i should be a clown yeah but i'm not

1520.32 --> 1524.559
though

1521.44 --> 1526.48
i'm this is the way i look right

1524.559 --> 1528.48
i know you want to project all kinds of

1526.48 --> 1533.52
garbage on that

1528.48 --> 1537.3600000000001
but i'm sorry that i offend you so much

1533.52 --> 1538.24
except that i'm not actually sorry

1537.36 --> 1539.84
like

1538.24 --> 1540.96
just squirt for me [ __ ] that's

1539.84 --> 1544.6399999999999
basically

1540.96 --> 1546.24
my actual opinion about that right

1544.64 --> 1548.64
but

1546.24 --> 1550.96
like if you're gonna try the troll then

1548.64 --> 1553.44
at least

1550.96 --> 1554.72
know who you're trolling

1553.44 --> 1556.96
right

1554.72 --> 1560.96
that's the problem isn't it you troll

1556.96 --> 1560.96
because you don't know anything

1561.12 --> 1565.4399999999998
and to mask

1562.96 --> 1567.2
that ignorance that you know you have

1565.44 --> 1569.44
because you can't really escape it when

1567.2 --> 1571.919
you're that ignorant you just spend your

1569.44 --> 1575.679
time by trying to pull other people down

1571.919 --> 1575.679
to your ignorant level

1578.96 --> 1583.3600000000001
you apologize

1580.88 --> 1585.8400000000001
okay

1583.36 --> 1585.84
for what

1599.72 --> 1602.809
[Music]

1605.36 --> 1608.6399999999999
i'm just gonna eat some dirt

1608.88 --> 1614.5590000000002
it's the best thing god's ever made dirt

1613.36 --> 1617.6
would have thought that you could

1614.559 --> 1621.1589999999999
literally survive on dirt

1617.6 --> 1621.1589999999999
dirt and water

1626.559 --> 1631.84
don't just only eat dirt i wouldn't

1629.039 --> 1635.279
recommend that but yeah

1631.84 --> 1635.279
supplement your diet a little

1635.36 --> 1639.7199999999998
because dirt is good

1640.159 --> 1643.159
ugh

1654.72 --> 1657.679
hey tony whitcomb

1665.44 --> 1669.76
what completely

1667.279 --> 1670.72
tigerli

1669.76 --> 1671.679
uh

1670.72 --> 1675.799
okay

1671.679 --> 1675.799
hello guns have never owned

1688.799 --> 1692.48
right

1689.84 --> 1697.039
by the way i actually got an email from

1692.48 --> 1700.08
a company that they wanted to advertise

1697.039 --> 1700.08
that's like a first

1705.6 --> 1708.399
apparently some

1709.12 --> 1715.4399999999998
video software video editing software

1713.6 --> 1718.1589999999999
from what i think is like a czech

1715.44 --> 1721.039
company or something

1718.159 --> 1721.0390000000002
czech or russian

1722.24 --> 1726.159
i don't mind

1723.76 --> 1728.64
and there is reviews of it on youtube

1726.159 --> 1730.48
too so yeah my

1728.64 --> 1733.44
it might actually be a pretty decent

1730.48 --> 1735.76
project so yeah i said i've responded

1733.44 --> 1737.52
that yeah i'd like to know more about

1735.76 --> 1740.8799999999999
how that works

1737.52 --> 1742.8799999999999
what would you expect of me etc

1740.88 --> 1746.48
because it does seem interesting right

1742.88 --> 1746.48
if it's a good product

1746.799 --> 1750.84
and yeah it's kind of relevant

1749.76 --> 1753.919
you

1750.84 --> 1756.9599999999998
know good videos editing software that

1753.919 --> 1756.96
isn't expensive

1757.12 --> 1761.6789999999999
yeah and i don't know how much money i'd

1759.279 --> 1763.039
get out of it maybe very little but

1761.679 --> 1765.679
it's

1763.039 --> 1768.1589999999999
worth inquiring at least

1765.679 --> 1769.919
so yeah

1768.159 --> 1772.5590000000002
that happened as well it's very

1769.919 --> 1775.2
unexpected i've never had like a an

1772.559 --> 1777.44
advertisement request before like that

1775.2 --> 1779.679
well i did have it one time before about

1777.44 --> 1782.3200000000002
another product but that just seemed

1779.679 --> 1786.159
completely like the website was broken

1782.32 --> 1786.1589999999999
and all that like that's not gonna work

1787.36 --> 1792.8799999999999
but this seems to be just an established

1790.399 --> 1795.84
software company and

1792.88 --> 1795.8400000000001
product looked pretty good

1796.08 --> 1800.559
so i'll get back to you on that

1798.48 --> 1804.159
start name dropping and all that as soon

1800.559 --> 1804.1589999999999
as i know that it's going to be worth it

1805.52 --> 1809.72
hey professor phil bell

1814.24 --> 1817.039
hello bex

1819.52 --> 1825.76
right but i was also kind of surprised

1822.0 --> 1826.24
though that like really me

1825.76 --> 1827.36
arwin

1826.24 --> 1830.72
[Music]

1827.36 --> 1833.6
deserves an advertisement

1830.72 --> 1837.279
so i don't know like how does that even

1833.6 --> 1839.4399999999998
make sense you know i only have 2.12 k

1837.279 --> 1841.44
subscribers yet they approach me through

1839.44 --> 1846.24
email that they want to advertise could

1841.44 --> 1848.559
it be that my subscribers don't actually

1846.24 --> 1850.96
properly reflect

1848.559 --> 1853.76
the overall internet activity that

1850.96 --> 1857.2
passes through my channel

1853.76 --> 1857.2
do they have other numbers

1857.84 --> 1861.6789999999999
right

1859.2 --> 1863.1200000000001
because why would you just

1861.679 --> 1865.039
approach

1863.12 --> 1867.279
a channel that has a show called flat

1865.039 --> 1870.1589999999999
earth early bird

1867.279 --> 1874.559
with only yeah with less than 10 000

1870.159 --> 1874.5590000000002
subscribers why why would you email them

1875.6 --> 1881.519
it's weird

1877.6 --> 1881.519
but yeah we'll see what comes of that

1885.6 --> 1890.399
i mean i do have affinity

1888.08 --> 1892.8799999999999
with like software developers and

1890.399 --> 1894.8799999999999
programmers and all that so

1892.88 --> 1896.88
maybe they actually looked into the

1894.88 --> 1898.64
details and thought like yeah that

1896.88 --> 1900.0
attunes we don't care if they're flat

1898.64 --> 1902.5590000000002
earth

1900.0 --> 1902.559
i don't know

1903.2 --> 1909.3600000000001
would you advertise for pfizer never

1906.559 --> 1909.36
never ever

1909.84 --> 1913.9189999999999
yeah i don't want to get dragged down

1914.48 --> 1919.039
into that pit where it's going to end up

1916.64 --> 1923.44
because all these people are

1919.039 --> 1925.44
involved in war criminal activities

1923.44 --> 1926.48
and i don't want to be a part of that

1925.44 --> 1928.3200000000002
yeah

1926.48 --> 1931.279
i know you can get a lot of money but

1928.32 --> 1934.8799999999999
yeah i don't want to

1931.279 --> 1938.24
it's like yeah i'm in

1934.88 --> 1939.279
as a metaphor i'm in the advertisement

1938.24 --> 1941.519
business

1939.279 --> 1943.48
for the nazi party

1941.519 --> 1945.1200000000001
in

1943.48 --> 1946.799
1938

1945.12 --> 1949.84
right it's like oh yeah you could get a

1946.799 --> 1949.84
lot of money but

1949.919 --> 1955.3600000000001
yeah that's not gonna end well you know

1953.12 --> 1957.6
yeah i'm not gonna advertise for pfizer

1955.36 --> 1959.9189999999999
if you know what i mean

1957.6 --> 1961.6789999999999
it's not a good time

1959.919 --> 1965.919
and not that any time would be a good

1961.679 --> 1965.919
time because they're a foul evil company

1967.519 --> 1969.84
right

1970.32 --> 1974.519
but especially not now

1978.159 --> 1982.159
hello from the grave

1980.72 --> 1987.3600000000001
have dinkle

1982.159 --> 1987.3600000000001
every man has his price no no they don't

1988.08 --> 1991.08
no

1992.24 --> 2000.24
i mean any man could be pushed into a

1995.279 --> 2000.24
corner and fooled to take money

2000.48 --> 2004.6
and then they'll regret it

2006.559 --> 2011.6
but no

2008.08 --> 2015.6399999999999
there's no price for

2011.6 --> 2015.6399999999999
for doing the right thing

2023.6 --> 2027.9189999999999
or rather first from stepping away from

2025.519 --> 2029.6
the right thing the there's no money

2027.919 --> 2032.5590000000002
number that can

2029.6 --> 2036.8799999999999
like oh that's that's how much i need

2032.559 --> 2036.8799999999999
to give up my soul uh no

2037.44 --> 2040.679
no thanks

2061.36 --> 2066.879
[Music]

2064.0 --> 2070.76
cool is controlled by government how

2066.879 --> 2070.7599999999998

2070.94 --> 2074.01
[Music]

2074.079 --> 2078.52
yeah low backs

2075.52 --> 2078.52
thanks

2094.8 --> 2097.76
oh man

2096.0 --> 2101.48
that's amazing

2097.76 --> 2101.48
the dirt worked

2103.119 --> 2108.8
it wheels really good

2105.92 --> 2111.8
google is controlled by f now they're

2108.8 --> 2111.8
entangled

2112.16 --> 2116.7999999999997
they're like mercenaries so they're

2115.359 --> 2119.2
yeah groups

2116.8 --> 2121.52
as you say alphabet agencies that have

2119.2 --> 2124.48
like they're using google

2121.52 --> 2126.4
but google is like a mercenary

2124.48 --> 2129.119
it's not really controlled it's

2126.4 --> 2133.28
contracted

2129.119 --> 2133.28
they just have contracts

2133.599 --> 2138.079
and yes they are heavily influenced by

2136.4 --> 2142.2400000000002
government

2138.079 --> 2143.6800000000003
or rather by a certain political party

2142.24 --> 2147.9199999999996
in ways

2143.68 --> 2147.9199999999996
they associate unfortunately

2157.04 --> 2162.079
and they also play

2160.079 --> 2164.96
games with like the really high up

2162.079 --> 2164.96
players as well

2166.88 --> 2169.04
they do

2168.079 --> 2169.8390000000004
yeah

2169.04 --> 2172.64
they

2169.839 --> 2175.119
basically play secret service corporate

2172.64 --> 2178.0
secret service for

2175.119 --> 2179.76
like well what we colloquially would

2178.0 --> 2183.76
understand as the bilderberg group or

2179.76 --> 2186.079
devos like the really big

2183.76 --> 2188.88
players that are trying to play the

2186.079 --> 2188.88
population

2190.4 --> 2195.2000000000003
they do work for them as well not just

2192.96 --> 2197.68
local governments and all that

2195.2 --> 2201.3999999999996
or federal governments

2197.68 --> 2201.3999999999996
they do a lot of things

2220.0 --> 2224.72
i used to help my friend on an internet

2223.04 --> 2228.4
shop

2224.72 --> 2228.3999999999996
google lies about everything

2231.4 --> 2234.489
[Music]

2236.24 --> 2241.04
i

2238.24 --> 2244.4799999999996
i don't know how to interpret that

2241.04 --> 2244.48
i mean if they have some like

2245.839 --> 2252.7999999999997
public relations

2249.04 --> 2255.04
story yeah i bet it's all garbage

2252.8 --> 2257.119
like i wouldn't trust any public

2255.04 --> 2258.72
relations story from google if you know

2257.119 --> 2260.88
what i mean

2258.72 --> 2265.1189999999997
but i mean

2260.88 --> 2265.119
not everything about google is a lie

2265.44 --> 2269.04
and i think there's still some pretty

2266.88 --> 2271.359
good people working in there that really

2269.04 --> 2273.599
do care about the internet and about

2271.359 --> 2274.7999999999997
social media quality

2273.599 --> 2279.52
right

2274.8 --> 2281.599
it's not just psycho evils

2279.52 --> 2284.599
but at the top yeah they get pretty

2281.599 --> 2284.599
disturbing

2300.72 --> 2305.839
oh by the way thank you back for the

2358.96 --> 2363.04
but yeah the

2360.56 --> 2366.839
communist party that's in control is

2363.04 --> 2366.839
pretty damn evil

2370.88 --> 2376.48
they don't seem to have any moral limit

2374.64 --> 2378.24
or objections

2376.48 --> 2382.0
about anything

2378.24 --> 2383.7599999999998
and that's very very painful and

2382.0 --> 2387.44
sickening at times

2383.76 --> 2390.92
but yeah the the people no

2387.44 --> 2390.92
they're not evil

2404.96 --> 2408.96
their government is the same as ours

2409.04 --> 2412.24
i hope not nathan

2414.24 --> 2418.04
i really hope not

2425.68 --> 2431.359
hello to the welcome to the stream by

2427.599 --> 2431.3590000000004
the way and hello george sanford

2436.8 --> 2439.8390000000004
it's like still party

2446.0 --> 2452.839
hey guns in that room

2448.88 --> 2452.839
i will check my paypal

2453.52 --> 2457.04
yeah

2454.88 --> 2460.04
thank you very much that is super

2457.04 --> 2460.04
helpful

2468.8 --> 2472.5600000000004
thank you

2470.079 --> 2472.5600000000004
awesome

2474.079 --> 2477.6400000000003
that's gonna help

2480.8 --> 2483.8
oh

2499.92 --> 2506.359
the last two years have proved that all

2501.92 --> 2506.359
governments are puppets of what

2515.92 --> 2523.04
i mean if you'd say that all governments

2518.319 --> 2526.079
were puppeteers i'd say yeah but puppets

2523.04 --> 2528.319
that implies that somebody's puppeting

2526.079 --> 2528.319
them

2528.48 --> 2532.4
so

2529.44 --> 2534.319
who's doing that how does that even work

2532.4 --> 2536.48
i think they're just joining in the

2534.319 --> 2541.2
puppet theater and they're all playing

2536.48 --> 2541.2
that game the game the liberals started

2542.8 --> 2545.28
like this

2545.839 --> 2550.0
second world

2547.599 --> 2550.8
view

2550.0 --> 2553.28
and

2550.8 --> 2556.319
every big government is now kind of

2553.28 --> 2558.8
trying to do that in their own way

2556.319 --> 2560.96
but they're not all like puppeted by a

2558.8 --> 2563.52
singular force

2560.96 --> 2565.2
i don't feel that at all

2563.52 --> 2568.4
i mean their methods

2565.2 --> 2570.56
often end up very similar

2568.4 --> 2572.2400000000002
but

2570.56 --> 2574.319
i still think that underneath it though

2572.24 --> 2576.72
it's just driven by

2574.319 --> 2581.44
the people

2576.72 --> 2581.4399999999996
and well the mistakes they make

2582.24 --> 2589.56
as they attain the power

2585.28 --> 2589.5600000000004
and become corrupted by it

2594.8 --> 2598.96
okay arroyo's here what

2604.64 --> 2610.56
vanguard and blackrock are top shells

2607.2 --> 2610.56
fight well that's messed up

2610.8 --> 2615.2000000000003
dude

2612.88 --> 2616.6400000000003
like i'm seriously wondering if those

2615.2 --> 2620.16
groups

2616.64 --> 2622.16
are are gonna be like freaking cobra

2620.16 --> 2625.2799999999997
from gi joe because they're really

2622.16 --> 2625.2799999999997
pushing that [ __ ]

2626.4 --> 2630.4
right

2628.16 --> 2633.8799999999997
how much different are they even from

2630.4 --> 2633.88
cobra nowadays

2638.64 --> 2643.68
have ever watched like the old gi joe

2641.119 --> 2646.92
cartoons or the movie especially what

2643.68 --> 2646.9199999999996
they're like

2665.119 --> 2671.52
if you could live in any country in the

2667.839 --> 2671.52
world where you choose to live

2672.4 --> 2675.8
i don't know

2679.92 --> 2683.28
i

2681.2 --> 2686.0
i don't think i could make it

2683.28 --> 2688.7200000000003
a good decision on that just like that

2686.0 --> 2690.8
because i don't know the other countries

2688.72 --> 2692.0
like i could choose like places that

2690.8 --> 2694.079
i've known

2692.0 --> 2697.359
like for example i know a little bit

2694.079 --> 2699.119
about spain a little

2697.359 --> 2701.04
does that mean that

2699.119 --> 2704.079
that would be a great country for me to

2701.04 --> 2705.44
go and live i don't know i have no idea

2704.079 --> 2707.52
probably not i think that the

2705.44 --> 2710.64
netherlands overall it does kind of work

2707.52 --> 2710.64
out the best even though

2710.96 --> 2716.16
like i find a lot of like

2713.92 --> 2718.7200000000003
the psyche and the culture that is going

2716.16 --> 2721.04
around very problematic and off-putting

2718.72 --> 2723.9199999999996
but i've always felt that does that mean

2721.04 --> 2726.56
i don't belong here

2723.92 --> 2726.56
i don't know

2726.88 --> 2731.839
maybe i

2728.319 --> 2734.839
be i'd feel like that in every place

2731.839 --> 2734.839
right

2760.72 --> 2766.319
right and just just for the record

2764.4 --> 2767.839
just for the record maybe some of you

2766.319 --> 2770.0
remember

2767.839 --> 2770.0
but

2770.24 --> 2775.2
yeah

2771.599 --> 2777.599
i actually wanted to move to

2775.2 --> 2780.0
or had in my mind like yeah

2777.599 --> 2782.0
new zealand man new zealand that's like

2780.0 --> 2783.359
the the best place

2782.0 --> 2785.76
that's like even better than the

2783.359 --> 2786.7999999999997
netherlands and great well look what

2785.76 --> 2787.76
happened

2786.8 --> 2788.96
right

2787.76 --> 2791.28
so

2788.96 --> 2793.68
what moving somewhere you think you can

2791.28 --> 2793.6800000000003
escape

2794.72 --> 2801.2799999999997
i think it is all basically

2798.88 --> 2804.48
it now functions as nets i think that

2801.28 --> 2806.96
every great place that's like that was

2804.48 --> 2808.16
or still is really great they're all

2806.96 --> 2811.119
gonna get it

2808.16 --> 2813.04
like everything is gonna eventually be

2811.119 --> 2815.52
used like a net

2813.04 --> 2816.4
to trap people

2815.52 --> 2818.079
everything

2816.4 --> 2819.76
there will not be a place on earth where

2818.079 --> 2823.44
there isn't that i don't think there's

2819.76 --> 2823.44
anywhere you can escape to really

2827.839 --> 2832.48
what the

2829.2 --> 2835.48
uh yeah backs i'm sorry i don't speak

2832.48 --> 2835.48
nerdish

2851.119 --> 2854.119
so

2859.68 --> 2863.52
right so yeah stevie traveler i

2864.8 --> 2869.119
there's not somewhere i would know just

2867.119 --> 2871.6800000000003
immediately like oh yeah go live there i

2869.119 --> 2874.559
have no idea and every place is going to

2871.68 --> 2877.5989999999997
have its problems

2874.559 --> 2879.8390000000004
just the change of the scenery and the

2877.599 --> 2884.839
way i would have to adapt to everything

2879.839 --> 2884.839
would probably not make it worth it

2896.64 --> 2902.64
right unless my life changes around and

2900.319 --> 2904.88
who knows maybe like get a girlfriend

2902.64 --> 2906.8799999999997
and then they we make plans or something

2904.88 --> 2908.88
like this is the place we should go for

2906.88 --> 2911.359
this and that

2908.88 --> 2914.4
that would probably be a reason why i

2911.359 --> 2917.359
would move it worked last time

2914.4 --> 2919.359
with my ex right i basically moved in

2917.359 --> 2921.119
with my ex into a new house in the area

2919.359 --> 2924.96
i'd never been before

2921.119 --> 2927.76
with a girlfriend yeah i i would

2924.96 --> 2931.2
be much more inclined to move

2927.76 --> 2934.3190000000004
but on my own absolutely not i'm gonna

2931.2 --> 2934.319
stay right here

2939.52 --> 2942.88
ah

2940.4 --> 2944.559
dutch is actually the father of german i

2942.88 --> 2945.92
don't know about that guns have never

2944.559 --> 2949.119
owned

2945.92 --> 2949.119
i don't know about that

2952.079 --> 2955.119
but

2952.88 --> 2955.119
like

2955.68 --> 2961.52
the netherlands and germany are pretty

2958.96 --> 2961.52
recent

2961.76 --> 2966.079
things

2964.0 --> 2968.88
like and the

2966.079 --> 2971.76
assumption of a singular culture is also

2968.88 --> 2975.04
so it's not that old

2971.76 --> 2977.28
right only a few hundred years

2975.04 --> 2979.52
before that it was all

2977.28 --> 2980.96
more loose tribes and then yeah the

2979.52 --> 2982.559
netherlands is right there it's right

2980.96 --> 2984.64
next to

2982.559 --> 2987.119
it was like a river mount to germany

2984.64 --> 2987.1189999999997
pretty much

2987.52 --> 2990.72
it's right next to it

2994.0 --> 2999.359
but language-wise

2996.72 --> 3002.16
i don't know about that i don't know

2999.359 --> 3002.16
how that worked

3003.28 --> 3008.4
from what i learned in school now is of

3005.359 --> 3012.0789999999997
course the history lesson so that might

3008.4 --> 3014.2400000000002
not be that correct at all in retrospect

3012.079 --> 3016.7200000000003
what i learned like no the

3014.24 --> 3021.2
we had the dietz

3016.72 --> 3023.839
which is like the dutch german

3021.2 --> 3025.9199999999996
tribes groups before it became the

3023.839 --> 3028.88
netherlands and we spoke a language that

3025.92 --> 3031.2000000000003
was kind of a bland

3028.88 --> 3032.319
it was kind of german but

3031.2 --> 3034.5589999999997
different

3032.319 --> 3036.16
like heavily accented german like more

3034.559 --> 3037.76
of a

3036.16 --> 3040.48
bland

3037.76 --> 3042.48
that kind of became a little a little

3040.48 --> 3045.2
anglified

3042.48 --> 3047.599
and german mix sort of a thing

3045.2 --> 3049.5989999999997
i don't even know how it got to that

3047.599 --> 3052.0
right was i wasn't even

3049.599 --> 3053.28
told about that in history

3052.0 --> 3055.44
class but

3053.28 --> 3057.0400000000004
that's what it was supposed to be

3055.44 --> 3059.359
to say that

3057.04 --> 3061.2
the dutch created the german language

3059.359 --> 3066.5989999999997
i'd have no

3061.2 --> 3066.5989999999997
information to support that claim at all

3071.28 --> 3075.8390000000004
why are you asking me these questions

3072.88 --> 3075.839
steamy traveler

3077.28 --> 3082.599
why

3079.2 --> 3082.5989999999997
what's the point

3096.4 --> 3100.0
i mean i'm not going anywhere

3100.96 --> 3105.48
hey getting wisdom good to see you

3123.839 --> 3128.72
i'm thinking of moving in value might be

3125.839 --> 3130.7999999999997
well i'm the worst when it comes to that

3128.72 --> 3134.2
see me traveler

3130.8 --> 3134.2000000000003
i'm the worst

3160.24 --> 3164.0789999999997
all right but yeah steam if you want to

3162.16 --> 3165.68
move it all depends on the

3164.079 --> 3167.52
what you're gonna

3165.68 --> 3169.44
what your life's gonna be

3167.52 --> 3172.319
like what do you do as a work what do

3169.44 --> 3175.28
you need for that

3172.319 --> 3175.2799999999997
how dependent on

3175.44 --> 3181.52
trade and supermarkets are you etc like

3179.119 --> 3183.119
you have to size that up how independent

3181.52 --> 3185.359
can you be the more independent you can

3183.119 --> 3187.52
be the further away from civilization

3185.359 --> 3190.0789999999997
you can be which is better healthier

3187.52 --> 3190.079
usually

3190.48 --> 3195.119
but can you handle that

3192.48 --> 3197.52
or do you need to be

3195.119 --> 3199.52
still very connected

3197.52 --> 3200.559
if you still need to be very connected

3199.52 --> 3202.96
then

3200.559 --> 3205.119
i'd say like

3202.96 --> 3207.44
the edge of a city

3205.119 --> 3209.04
like where i'm at i i'm feeling pretty

3207.44 --> 3211.92
good here like i wouldn't want to live

3209.04 --> 3212.72
like in the inner city here

3211.92 --> 3214.559
but

3212.72 --> 3217.7999999999997
kind of on the edge of the city is a

3214.559 --> 3217.8
great place

3225.599 --> 3228.319
i don't know if that's gonna help you

3227.2 --> 3229.52
but

3228.319 --> 3232.24
yeah

3229.52 --> 3235.24
i i'm not really good with that sort of

3232.24 --> 3235.24
thing

3242.319 --> 3244.64
i mean

3246.0 --> 3251.04
i just don't like moving at all i find

3248.559 --> 3252.559
it kind of traumatic

3251.04 --> 3255.359
because i'm

3252.559 --> 3257.3590000000004
somebody that really

3255.359 --> 3261.2
sets roots in everything i don't want to

3257.359 --> 3264.839
lose anything i get how do you call it

3261.2 --> 3264.839
let me look it up

3265.48 --> 3268.61
[Applause]

3271.44 --> 3275.839
yeah i get attached that's the

3274.079 --> 3278.4
proper phrase i get attached to

3275.839 --> 3280.5589999999997
everything i get it attached to objects

3278.4 --> 3282.7200000000003
i get attached to the place

3280.559 --> 3285.44
i get attached to animals i get attached

3282.72 --> 3287.1189999999997
to every freaking thing it's like the

3285.44 --> 3289.68
big curse

3287.119 --> 3291.76
on my side is that i just can't let

3289.68 --> 3293.68
things go

3291.76 --> 3296.1600000000003
that's my personal

3293.68 --> 3298.64
spiritual problem so i'm not really good

3296.16 --> 3300.8799999999997
at asking for advice like oh where would

3298.64 --> 3302.4
you move like i don't want to move

3300.88 --> 3305.6400000000003
and that's my first response i don't

3302.4 --> 3305.64
want to move

3307.839 --> 3312.88
do most dutch renter owner hub i have no

3310.48 --> 3312.88
idea

3315.119 --> 3320.28
i have absolutely no idea steaming

3317.28 --> 3320.28
traveler

3323.04 --> 3327.04
i think there's all kinds of

3324.16 --> 3328.3999999999996
arrangements like that

3327.04 --> 3332.0
there's even like

3328.4 --> 3334.559
places where you basically

3332.0 --> 3338.4
have the bank buy it

3334.559 --> 3338.4
and then you rent it from the bank

3338.48 --> 3344.72
and

3340.559 --> 3346.7200000000003
yeah instead of just a typical

3344.72 --> 3348.3999999999996
mortgage

3346.72 --> 3350.319
and then you buy it right

3348.4 --> 3352.079
so there's all kinds of ways i don't

3350.319 --> 3355.079
know how the dutch people do that on

3352.079 --> 3355.079
average

3366.72 --> 3369.04
hmm

3369.44 --> 3373.76
okay yeah guns have never owned look

3371.839 --> 3377.44
if you want me to check out that video

3373.76 --> 3380.7200000000003
you're gonna have to post the link

3377.44 --> 3383.359
i'm not doing it like oh searching for a

3380.72 --> 3385.359
title in the youtube search engine and

3383.359 --> 3386.64
then expecting to get i don't do that

3385.359 --> 3388.48
anymore

3386.64 --> 3390.96
right you gotta either have if you wanna

3388.48 --> 3392.64
do that you got to have the channel

3390.96 --> 3394.559
right there

3392.64 --> 3397.2799999999997
it's better to just find the video and

3394.559 --> 3397.28
then post it

3397.76 --> 3402.6800000000003
and you have a wrench so there should be

3399.359 --> 3402.68
no problem

3405.359 --> 3408.359
so

3450.079 --> 3454.96
stay rooted to where you are no reason

3451.839 --> 3457.599
to move yeah that's my sentiment too

3454.96 --> 3459.76
because i like it here

3457.599 --> 3461.92
like the only thing i don't like about

3459.76 --> 3465.3590000000004
this place is that i don't have really a

3461.92 --> 3467.6800000000003
garden and i don't have more room

3465.359 --> 3471.119
that's like the only regret the rest of

3467.68 --> 3472.8799999999997
this place is epic is really what i like

3471.119 --> 3475.599
i like

3472.88 --> 3478.799
being on a relatively high spot

3475.599 --> 3480.96
but not like super high

3478.799 --> 3484.48
and surrounded by green and i have a

3480.96 --> 3486.2400000000002
whole roof basically

3484.48 --> 3488.319
as a roof garden

3486.24 --> 3491.9199999999996
and officially and i can just go there

3488.319 --> 3493.68
nobody's stopping me it's not illegal

3491.92 --> 3496.2400000000002
right

3493.68 --> 3499.24
so especially in the summer it's great

3496.24 --> 3499.24
here

3507.119 --> 3513.2000000000003
but yeah if i certainly had more money

3510.0 --> 3514.96
i had no idea how that would happen

3513.2 --> 3517.839
then i would consider

3514.96 --> 3517.839
getting

3518.079 --> 3520.4
yeah

3520.72 --> 3524.24
kind of like a

3521.92 --> 3527.28
house or something with a small garden

3524.24 --> 3530.0
somewhere in a good spot

3527.28 --> 3531.599
in in a similar region like this it

3530.0 --> 3533.52
would take quite a while to find

3531.599 --> 3534.6400000000003
something good though

3533.52 --> 3536.96
but

3534.64 --> 3536.96
yeah

3537.76 --> 3541.8390000000004
but yeah i don't have that so yeah

3540.319 --> 3546.24
why would i even think about that

3541.839 --> 3547.599
there's not i don't anticipate any large

3546.24 --> 3550.16
sum of money

3547.599 --> 3552.559
arriving anytime soon

3550.16 --> 3552.5589999999997

3622.319 --> 3629.72
no i wasn't timed out i was blocked

3625.359 --> 3629.72
not a singular message appeared

3629.92 --> 3633.599
i refreshed and all my texts that i had

3632.64 --> 3636.72
written

3633.599 --> 3639.04
in your show yesterday it was all gone

3636.72 --> 3643.16
so nobody timed me out it just didn't

3639.04 --> 3643.16
appear that means that i'm blocked

3644.64 --> 3648.24
or rather i'm banned

3646.559 --> 3651.2400000000002
banned from your

3648.24 --> 3651.24
chat

3682.4 --> 3685.4
right

3716.0 --> 3719.839
you don't know how to put the link in

3717.52 --> 3723.119
the chat

3719.839 --> 3723.119
it's just copy paste

3724.799 --> 3729.119
you just find the video

3726.4 --> 3732.079
get into the

3729.119 --> 3732.079
the url

3732.16 --> 3737.2799999999997
select it or copy it and then just

3736.319 --> 3739.0389999999998
yeah

3737.28 --> 3741.8390000000004
paste it

3739.039 --> 3741.8390000000004
in the chat

3742.24 --> 3746.4799999999996
might be i don't know how difficult is

3744.4 --> 3747.92
that is to do that on a mobile phone

3746.48 --> 3751.16
though

3747.92 --> 3751.16
no idea

3759.359 --> 3761.7599999999998
what

3763.599 --> 3767.119
you froze up

3765.28 --> 3769.6800000000003
okay

3767.119 --> 3773.7200000000003
no i was definitely not resting

3769.68 --> 3773.72
still i'm still alive

3782.4 --> 3786.2000000000003
turn on laptop okay

3827.68 --> 3832.799
oh yes yeah what steamy traveler said

3830.0 --> 3834.64
that could also work i don't know

3832.799 --> 3837.119
like i don't know about how that works

3834.64 --> 3838.799
with the mobile interface i've never had

3837.119 --> 3841.28
one

3838.799 --> 3845.359
in order to test how that works

3841.28 --> 3845.3590000000004
only ever interfaced through pc

3846.319 --> 3851.4
through just a desktop or a laptop

3871.68 --> 3876.799
let the fork

3873.599 --> 3881.119
just thought you should

3876.799 --> 3882.4
know that the dutch superior to german

3881.119 --> 3884.799
well

3882.4 --> 3886.1600000000003
yeah as a dutch person i would have to

3884.799 --> 3888.48
agree

3886.16 --> 3890.72
out of principle alone

3888.48 --> 3890.72
but

3891.119 --> 3898.0
yeah i'm not really gonna

3894.4 --> 3898.0
emphasize all that too much

3905.039 --> 3911.119
but i could at least say that well

3907.76 --> 3911.119
for uh however like

3911.599 --> 3918.4
pc infested and gay nonsense

3916.559 --> 3919.92
like at least we're not as bad as the

3918.4 --> 3920.839
germans

3919.92 --> 3923.44
in

3920.839 --> 3925.119
ways right that's

3923.44 --> 3927.44
that's about as

3925.119 --> 3930.0
good as it gets

3927.44 --> 3932.48
like they always seem to be worse

3930.0 --> 3934.48
more fanatical more mind control more

3932.48 --> 3937.28
doubling down on

3934.48 --> 3939.039
idiocy

3937.28 --> 3942.039
their numpties are worse than our

3939.039 --> 3942.039
numpties

3980.4 --> 3984.599
german irish okay

3992.559 --> 3995.559
hmm

4030.559 --> 4035.8390000000004
right so yeah

4032.559 --> 4035.8390000000004
still waiting on that link

4036.4 --> 4038.7200000000003
what

4041.839 --> 4046.0
yeah what do you guys want me to talk

4043.76 --> 4046.0
about

4046.64 --> 4051.1189999999997
oh the show has already been going for a

4049.119 --> 4053.599
while

4051.119 --> 4057.359
but i still want like at least another

4053.599 --> 4057.3590000000004
25 minutes out of the show

4057.52 --> 4062.359
but i don't really have any more

4059.359 --> 4062.359
subjects

4062.88 --> 4068.4
i yeah i brought some to the table but

4066.559 --> 4069.6800000000003
not a lot i don't really have a lot of

4068.4 --> 4072.2400000000002
depth

4069.68 --> 4073.9199999999996
for all of it

4072.24 --> 4074.8799999999997
but yeah there does seem to be kind of

4073.92 --> 4077.119
like a

4074.88 --> 4078.1600000000003
a change

4077.119 --> 4081.359
happening

4078.16 --> 4081.359
so yeah maybe

4082.319 --> 4088.0
maybe this is the response

4084.559 --> 4090.88
to my inquiry to the world like

4088.0 --> 4093.839
do you know any way we could

4090.88 --> 4096.96
like actually stop this peacefully

4093.839 --> 4100.4
because i really did not think we could

4096.96 --> 4102.4
but now apparently

4100.4 --> 4104.239
they're retreating

4102.4 --> 4105.599999999999
and that doesn't mean it's the end so

4104.239 --> 4109.3589999999995
maybe

4105.6 --> 4109.359
i'm still going to be proven right

4111.759 --> 4115.44
but at least it seems like

4116.239 --> 4120.3189999999995
the battle is one for now

4124.64 --> 4128.319
you're the boss whatever you want to

4126.239 --> 4130.639999999999
talk about

4128.319 --> 4132.319
now that's not how yeah that is how it

4130.64 --> 4134.88
works if i want to talk about something

4132.319 --> 4137.92
i'm going to talk about something but

4134.88 --> 4137.92
right now there's not

4138.239 --> 4142.2789999999995
really anything in particular

4152.56 --> 4159.2390000000005
whoa want me to give you

4154.56 --> 4159.2390000000005
investment advice now steamy traveler

4163.6 --> 4168.719
right but yeah silver sure silver is

4166.159 --> 4168.719
always good

4168.88 --> 4173.679
and you can use silver for practical

4171.759 --> 4177.12
applications as well

4173.679 --> 4177.12
if it's pure silver

4177.359 --> 4182.88
it's like even second hand

4179.839 --> 4184.0
silver any sort of silver is is good for

4182.88 --> 4188.279
something

4184.0 --> 4188.279
you can always do something with it

4190.88 --> 4194.719
although yeah gold is

4192.799 --> 4196.96
overall easier to store more

4194.719 --> 4200.84
concentrated value with less weight less

4196.96 --> 4200.84
space it takes up

4202.32 --> 4209.28
but silver is a very useful metal and

4205.84 --> 4211.84
it's kind of easy tradable too

4209.28 --> 4213.759999999999
so it's more practical for actual trade

4211.84 --> 4215.52
right gold coins and all that that's

4213.76 --> 4219.04
just like it's always going to be big

4215.52 --> 4221.360000000001
money so that's just business like for

4219.04 --> 4224.159
business deals that could work

4221.36 --> 4226.32
platinum or palladium

4224.159 --> 4226.32
i

4227.44 --> 4230.5599999999995
well not

4228.64 --> 4232.400000000001
really

4230.56 --> 4235.04
well you could

4232.4 --> 4235.04
i guess

4235.28 --> 4238.8
but those are more like industrial types

4237.6 --> 4239.76
of metals

4238.8 --> 4244.4400000000005
so

4239.76 --> 4244.4400000000005
i guess you could invest in that

4249.04 --> 4253.28
but yeah those are more like in the in

4250.96 --> 4256.4
the range of gold because they are much

4253.28 --> 4256.4
they're very valuable

4257.6 --> 4262.159000000001
but yeah you could go there as well sure

4259.679 --> 4262.159
why not

4265.199 --> 4269.919999999999
but yeah don't take any direct financial

4268.0 --> 4271.84
advice from me

4269.92 --> 4273.84
when it comes to that sort of investment

4271.84 --> 4276.159000000001
because i have no idea of the swings of

4273.84 --> 4278.08
the market i i'm not the person to tell

4276.159 --> 4279.5199999999995
you like oh you're gonna do this now

4278.08 --> 4282.96
because this is gonna happen because i

4279.52 --> 4284.8
have no idea

4282.96 --> 4286.96
when

4284.8 --> 4289.04
the pendulum even swings

4286.96 --> 4291.12
right

4289.04 --> 4294.12
with the value of those types of

4291.12 --> 4294.12
investments

4300.0 --> 4304.159
oh all right

4302.56 --> 4306.64
you couldn't find the link guns would

4304.159 --> 4310.599999999999
never own

4306.64 --> 4310.6
all right i'll see you

4368.08 --> 4371.159
all right

4371.199 --> 4376.879999999999
so anyway don't forget to check out

4374.56 --> 4379.679
the circuit board earth video

4376.88 --> 4381.28
from michelle gibson

4379.679 --> 4384.76
it's very good

4381.28 --> 4384.759999999999
very interesting

4385.679 --> 4392.32
and definitely worth pondering upon

4389.28 --> 4392.32
at least for a while

4393.92 --> 4398.28
because there might be a lot to it

4417.6 --> 4419.92
whoa

4424.48 --> 4428.239
whoa that's a lot of titanium the guns

4427.04 --> 4430.32
are number one

4428.239 --> 4435.639999999999
damn

4430.32 --> 4435.639999999999
can you send link again right

4442.88 --> 4447.2390000000005
yeah i will send the link hold on

4461.84 --> 4466.0
right this is

4463.199 --> 4467.839999999999
to her channel so

4466.0 --> 4470.239
yeah check it out definitely worth

4467.84 --> 4470.2390000000005
watching

4480.84 --> 4487.04
it it's 43 minutes

4485.04 --> 4490.08
so it's not super long

4487.04 --> 4493.88
but yeah very compact with info

4490.08 --> 4493.88
and great pictures

4504.48 --> 4507.48
hmm

4512.64 --> 4518.0
all right yeah see you later guns nero

4514.64 --> 4518.0
thanks for the paypal again

4521.6 --> 4526.64
what just asked youtube to rate this

4524.64 --> 4528.719
show and it gave me five stars and

4526.64 --> 4530.400000000001
marked informative what

4528.719 --> 4533.36
really

4530.4 --> 4533.36
how does that work

4534.48 --> 4538.5599999999995
oh you

4535.92 --> 4540.88
were asked

4538.56 --> 4541.92
i thought that youtube did that but yeah

4540.88 --> 4544.0
thanks

4541.92 --> 4545.84
thanks for that rating very thank you

4544.0 --> 4547.12
very much all people free people i

4545.84 --> 4550.8
appreciate that

4547.12 --> 4553.36
how does that even work how do you rate

4550.8 --> 4555.76
is that like a youtube plus thing or

4553.36 --> 4555.759999999999
something

4556.56 --> 4560.280000000001
or youtube premium

4590.64 --> 4597.88
come on let's have a conversation why is

4592.88 --> 4597.88
kyle we can have a conversation in chat

4625.12 --> 4629.92
it's yeah but i don't know who you are

4627.679 --> 4632.8
so i'm not just gonna invite some random

4629.92 --> 4636.0
person from my chat

4632.8 --> 4639.56
into a verbal conversation so that's not

4636.0 --> 4639.56
what i'm gonna do

4669.52 --> 4673.120000000001
that's interesting gaining wisdom

4673.44 --> 4677.759999999999
you think that the heart has a direct

4675.36 --> 4679.12
influence on basically spiritual

4677.76 --> 4683.12
perception

4679.12 --> 4683.12
there there might be something to that

4683.76 --> 4688.88
i mean it's it isn't

4685.92 --> 4691.52
designated a specific chakra or rather

4688.88 --> 4693.92
the central chakra

4691.52 --> 4696.080000000001
for no reason it's there for a reason

4693.92 --> 4697.84
it's a central chakra for a reason so

4696.08 --> 4700.08
yeah it's

4697.84 --> 4701.6
it i'm pretty damn sure it does have a

4700.08 --> 4703.679
lot of influence

4701.6 --> 4706.400000000001
even on perception and even like the

4703.679 --> 4709.4400000000005
frequency i think that the heart

4706.4 --> 4711.28
is the carrier of the frequency

4709.44 --> 4713.12
that you emit

4711.28 --> 4715.759999999999
i think that

4713.12 --> 4719.719
when i read people i basically read the

4715.76 --> 4719.719
frequency of their heart

4720.64 --> 4725.12
i think that's what my extra senses are

4722.88 --> 4725.12
doing

4725.6 --> 4730.0
right

4726.719 --> 4732.64
you combine the frequency output of the

4730.0 --> 4735.6
heart with expressions which would be a

4732.64 --> 4736.56
response like every physical aspect

4735.6 --> 4738.0
and

4736.56 --> 4741.76
demeanor and

4738.0 --> 4741.76
like your stance would be

4742.08 --> 4747.84
a response to

4744.88 --> 4750.56
that frequency like how do you compose

4747.84 --> 4752.56
yourself in response to what that feels

4750.56 --> 4755.84
like right

4752.56 --> 4755.84
that makes perfect sense to

4760.84 --> 4766.2390000000005
me oh my god it's that guy again isn't

4764.08 --> 4766.239
it

4766.4 --> 4771.12
no i never said

4768.159 --> 4772.799999999999
tides were caused by the sun yesterday

4771.12 --> 4776.599999999999
that's not what i was talking about

4772.8 --> 4776.6
yesterday ice kyle

4777.28 --> 4784.08
i said it was bound to the astrological

4781.199 --> 4787.04
cycle of the sun and not the moon that's

4784.08 --> 4790.04
what i said not that it is caused by

4787.04 --> 4790.04
either

4790.4 --> 4797.879999999999
right lights in the sky

4793.199 --> 4797.879999999999
don't physically cause things

4809.04 --> 4813.679
when i said the current model would

4810.88 --> 4816.2390000000005
cause a tsunami

4813.679 --> 4818.0
yeah well that's not me saying that

4816.239 --> 4819.919999999999
that's like neil degrasse tyson and

4818.0 --> 4821.92
that's a whole bunch of those globe spin

4819.92 --> 4824.32
doctors saying it

4821.92 --> 4826.32
just saying it like this is what this is

4824.32 --> 4828.239
what should happen

4826.32 --> 4831.199
but it doesn't they just don't talk

4828.239 --> 4833.36
about it they just show it like yeah

4831.199 --> 4835.199
this is how our model really is it

4833.36 --> 4836.88
doesn't work like that that's not the

4835.199 --> 4840.159
real world but

4836.88 --> 4842.4800000000005
just think about this right just

4840.159 --> 4844.159
consider this

4842.48 --> 4846.48
this is what it's supposed to be it's

4844.159 --> 4848.48
not it doesn't matter because this is

4846.48 --> 4851.199
what you need to know about how it's

4848.48 --> 4851.199
supposed to be

4853.12 --> 4857.44
lights in disguise stars and galaxies no

4856.639 --> 4862.56
no

4857.44 --> 4865.599999999999
no holographic only light phenomena

4862.56 --> 4865.6
not galaxies

4866.8 --> 4872.719
none of it is a physical thing none of

4868.96 --> 4876.08
it originates from a physical thing

4872.719 --> 4877.84
from a light or a lamp or a ball of fire

4876.08 --> 4880.32
or anything

4877.84 --> 4881.84
it's a holographic manifestation it's a

4880.32 --> 4883.759999999999
side effect

4881.84 --> 4885.52
of light

4883.76 --> 4888.08
arriving

4885.52 --> 4890.080000000001
yeah seriously man here we go again see

4888.08 --> 4891.199
oh every time the same

4890.08 --> 4894.0
yeah

4891.199 --> 4897.12
i mean how many years do i need to

4894.0 --> 4899.6
mention that every single day before

4897.12 --> 4902.08
people stop being surprised at me saying

4899.6 --> 4904.639
that i've been saying that for years for

4902.08 --> 4906.96
six years i've been saying that

4904.639 --> 4909.84
how can we see saturn because it too is

4906.96 --> 4911.199
a hologram it's all a hologram all of it

4909.84 --> 4913.6
is a hologram

4911.199 --> 4915.678999999999
it's all holographic light only there's

4913.6 --> 4917.4400000000005
no physical thing

4915.679 --> 4920.719
you can't approach it

4917.44 --> 4922.879999999999
and then see it change angular size

4920.719 --> 4925.28
because you're not approaching a

4922.88 --> 4928.2390000000005
physical thing in which case you would

4925.28 --> 4932.8
see an angular size increase you don't

4928.239 --> 4932.799999999999
it's holographic none of it is physical

4934.159 --> 4938.08
it's wrong oh yeah oh you have so much

4936.719 --> 4940.88
evidence

4938.08 --> 4942.239
so much evidence right let me guess

4940.88 --> 4943.4400000000005
satellites

4942.239 --> 4947.0
yeah

4943.44 --> 4948.638999999999
nice images from nasa

4947.0 --> 4951.28
emery

4948.639 --> 4953.12
got any more shady arguments

4951.28 --> 4956.32
non-proof

4953.12 --> 4959.32
for your physical claims of celestial

4956.32 --> 4959.32
lights

4961.28 --> 4966.639
oh is it not physical

4963.52 --> 4970.400000000001
because it doesn't have a physical body

4966.639 --> 4973.84
it's just a image of light

4970.4 --> 4973.839999999999
it's not physical

4977.6 --> 4982.1990000000005
what why did you delete that message

4993.6 --> 4999.84
why would an image of light show a

4995.52 --> 5003.84
planet to [ __ ] with you ice

4999.84 --> 5006.0
to [ __ ] with you that's why

5003.84 --> 5008.8
because you are going to be an

5006.0 --> 5010.8
indoctrinated [ __ ]

5008.8 --> 5014.56
that just thinks like oh but that looks

5010.8 --> 5016.88
like a ball or a thing or something

5014.56 --> 5018.56
i was told it was a ball i was

5016.88 --> 5020.96
represented

5018.56 --> 5024.159000000001
i mean i was presented with all this

5020.96 --> 5026.4800000000005
3d visual imagery that makes it even

5024.159 --> 5027.5199999999995
more convincing that that light there is

5026.48 --> 5031.199
a ball

5027.52 --> 5033.120000000001
so now it can only be a ball right

5031.199 --> 5035.04
yeah it is a great explanation because

5033.12 --> 5035.84
that's what it is you're being [ __ ]

5035.04 --> 5038.4
with

5035.84 --> 5040.159000000001
it's an image of light you don't know

5038.4 --> 5043.759999999999
what it is

5040.159 --> 5045.759999999999
i don't know why it is the way it is

5043.76 --> 5048.400000000001
but it's not a physical object in any

5045.76 --> 5050.8
location you can't approach it you can't

5048.4 --> 5054.08
have an experience a visual experience

5050.8 --> 5056.400000000001
where you have the angular size increase

5054.08 --> 5059.04
because you physically approach it there

5056.4 --> 5062.08
is no such evidence

5059.04 --> 5064.239
it's all images of light you're being

5062.08 --> 5067.12
you're being banned [ __ ] off

5064.239 --> 5071.12
[ __ ] you think you could have a a

5067.12 --> 5072.719
verbal conversation with me you [ __ ]

5071.12 --> 5076.92
[ __ ]

5072.719 --> 5076.92
get the [ __ ] outta here

5113.38 --> 5116.55
[Music]

5120.32 --> 5125.4
or baller gammas and their demands

5126.239 --> 5131.599999999999
what you really think i'm just gonna

5128.08 --> 5133.76
call you up on skype or something

5131.6 --> 5136.639
and then verbally

5133.76 --> 5139.4400000000005
have you squirt like a baller does

5136.639 --> 5140.8
saying that shitty type of [ __ ]

5139.44 --> 5142.0
verbally

5140.8 --> 5143.6
no

5142.0 --> 5145.76
i have better

5143.6 --> 5148.320000000001
things to do with my time like being

5145.76 --> 5150.0
completely silent and just waiting

5148.32 --> 5152.5599999999995
that's like a better way to spend my

5150.0 --> 5154.88
time than to entertain

5152.56 --> 5157.679
a dunce

5154.88 --> 5157.679
like yourself

5158.4 --> 5163.44
who doesn't even respond to actual

5161.04 --> 5165.84
arguments and inquiry and explanations

5163.44 --> 5168.5599999999995
and just say oh you're just delusional

5165.84 --> 5172.0
oh yeah that's great evidence that's

5168.56 --> 5174.2390000000005
such a great counter argument man

5172.0 --> 5177.56
i mean you have all this proof that you

5174.239 --> 5177.5599999999995
don't have

5190.4 --> 5193.44
yeah that's not gonna work no no you're

5192.4 --> 5196.32
not

5193.44 --> 5198.638999999999
going to write a single thing in my chat

5196.32 --> 5198.639
again

5198.88 --> 5203.28
i don't care how many socks you make i'm

5201.199 --> 5207.879999999999
gonna delete them all you're a [ __ ] and

5203.28 --> 5207.88
you need to get the [ __ ] out of my show

5226.719 --> 5233.28
i'm sick of this guys i mean how

5230.159 --> 5234.48
how concisely must i constantly throw

5233.28 --> 5237.44
out

5234.48 --> 5240.4
my argumentation for my positions

5237.44 --> 5241.44
like about the celestial light

5240.4 --> 5244.5599999999995
like

5241.44 --> 5247.36
i can't really get more concise i'm just

5244.56 --> 5249.04
like really condensing everything you

5247.36 --> 5251.36
need to know to even attempt to

5249.04 --> 5253.76
understand what i'm talking about

5251.36 --> 5255.5199999999995
in what i'm saying in my rebuttals very

5253.76 --> 5258.639
quickly

5255.52 --> 5262.639
and this is the response i get just a

5258.639 --> 5262.639
bunch of pouting [ __ ]

5262.96 --> 5266.679
it's pathetic

5273.679 --> 5277.159
yeah i can

5287.84 --> 5291.12
why don't you go and find an argument

5290.239 --> 5293.36
right

5291.12 --> 5294.719
as soon as you got an argument you can

5293.36 --> 5298.0
attempt to get

5294.719 --> 5300.8
a new sock account as you do

5298.0 --> 5302.08
and then present that instead of just

5300.8 --> 5304.0
spamming

5302.08 --> 5306.84
whining

5304.0 --> 5309.52
at home [ __ ]

5306.84 --> 5311.1990000000005
yeah but you get a point

5309.52 --> 5313.280000000001
get a [ __ ] point

5311.199 --> 5315.28
stop spamming

5313.28 --> 5318.599999999999
pouty nonsense

5315.28 --> 5318.599999999999
get a point

5328.96 --> 5333.36
they still believe in a spinning ball or

5330.88 --> 5337.159000000001
at the ad they do

5333.36 --> 5337.159
that's all they got left

5357.44 --> 5360.799999999999
all right anyway i'm gonna take two

5358.96 --> 5365.32
minute break and then

5360.8 --> 5365.320000000001
i'm probably gonna round out the show

5454.48 --> 5459.0
ah the trollers are gonna troll indeed

5465.199 --> 5468.48
publish my theories

5471.84 --> 5478.8
yeah i've thought about that before but

5475.76 --> 5481.12
i mean it's constantly

5478.8 --> 5483.6
being improved right in a way

5481.12 --> 5485.76
i don't mind having to continually

5483.6 --> 5489.120000000001
explain it

5485.76 --> 5490.719
it's just that when they then respond in

5489.12 --> 5492.88
that way

5490.719 --> 5493.92
is what pisses me off is that they're

5492.88 --> 5495.92
not like

5493.92 --> 5498.2390000000005
hmm i don't fully understand could you

5495.92 --> 5500.8
explain what you mean by this or have

5498.239 --> 5502.718999999999
just intricate detailed questions about

5500.8 --> 5504.88
what i'm saying

5502.719 --> 5507.679
that he didn't do that he was just like

5504.88 --> 5509.76
no you're just delusional that's that's

5507.679 --> 5512.96
what pisses me off

5509.76 --> 5515.4400000000005
not the explaining part actually

5512.96 --> 5517.76
it's just that the constantly explaining

5515.44 --> 5519.759999999999
and then having that as a response that

5517.76 --> 5521.360000000001
is what is pissing me off not actually

5519.76 --> 5523.360000000001
explaining it because

5521.36 --> 5524.96
the explaining is a constant work in

5523.36 --> 5527.92
development

5524.96 --> 5531.52
i'm always trying to do that over and

5527.92 --> 5534.0
over again because i'm i need to do that

5531.52 --> 5537.120000000001
in order to perfect it

5534.0 --> 5539.44
because my entire understanding of what

5537.12 --> 5542.4
i think that is

5539.44 --> 5545.12
is still under construction because i

5542.4 --> 5548.08
don't know what it is i just know

5545.12 --> 5548.96
that with all the traits the celestials

5548.08 --> 5551.199
have

5548.96 --> 5553.44
revealed so far they seem to be

5551.199 --> 5555.678999999999
holographic

5553.44 --> 5559.199
and there's not even like a solid word

5555.679 --> 5561.6
for that i have to basically go by

5559.199 --> 5563.5199999999995
the etymology of the word

5561.6 --> 5566.320000000001
and improvise

5563.52 --> 5568.080000000001
it as a description

5566.32 --> 5571.199
right so i'm constantly building

5568.08 --> 5574.239
describing explaining what how i'm

5571.199 --> 5576.4
describing it how i'm using the words

5574.239 --> 5577.839999999999
because i'm literally trying to define

5576.4 --> 5580.879999999999
something

5577.84 --> 5583.76
where before there was no

5580.88 --> 5588.719
no approach no way of analyzing it like

5583.76 --> 5591.52
that i'm creating a new perception

5588.719 --> 5593.76
i think is new

5591.52 --> 5596.88
because i've never seen any reference to

5593.76 --> 5599.92
that like that nothing like that never

5596.88 --> 5602.4800000000005
exactly like that

5599.92 --> 5606.96
like vague hints at best like yeah it's

5602.48 --> 5606.959999999999
not just a light somewhere hanging

5607.04 --> 5609.44
but

5607.84 --> 5611.1990000000005
never like yeah it's actually like a

5609.44 --> 5614.638999999999
hologram it's a thing that moves with

5611.199 --> 5616.638999999999
you except nobody nobody

5614.639 --> 5617.92
nobody

5616.639 --> 5619.92
so or

5617.92 --> 5622.0
nobody came up with that in human

5619.92 --> 5624.28
history

5622.0 --> 5626.88
up until this point or it was

5624.28 --> 5629.199
meticulously erased

5626.88 --> 5631.679
up until this point

5629.199 --> 5633.599999999999
so that nobody can bump into it i don't

5631.679 --> 5635.4400000000005
know

5633.6 --> 5638.320000000001
i don't know

5635.44 --> 5640.08
it's already pretty complex the grasp if

5638.32 --> 5642.48
it would have been deleted it's not

5640.08 --> 5643.76
surprising that nobody would bump into

5642.48 --> 5645.199
it

5643.76 --> 5647.6
in all these

5645.199 --> 5650.159
that yeah and all these

5647.6 --> 5650.159000000001
centuries

5650.48 --> 5653.36
because

5651.36 --> 5654.719
it's too difficult to

5653.36 --> 5658.96
grasp it and you're going to have

5654.719 --> 5661.36
everybody's psychology constantly

5658.96 --> 5664.08
disagreeing with you not getting it

5661.36 --> 5666.08
getting pissed off mocking you yeah who

5664.08 --> 5668.08
would want to do that right if you have

5666.08 --> 5669.12
no other references

5668.08 --> 5670.88
so

5669.12 --> 5672.719
it might have been figured out yeah it's

5670.88 --> 5674.96
holographic it's just like a hologram

5672.719 --> 5677.44
this exactly that works

5674.96 --> 5679.76
in ancient times and then they just edit

5677.44 --> 5682.5599999999995
it out and then literally everybody

5679.76 --> 5684.96
completely forgot about it

5682.56 --> 5686.96
because it's too difficult normally to

5684.96 --> 5688.32
even come up with that on your own

5686.96 --> 5690.0
volition

5688.32 --> 5691.92
i did though

5690.0 --> 5694.8
cause i'm like that

5691.92 --> 5698.119
i like to dig where nobody digs that's

5694.8 --> 5698.119000000001
what i do

5702.4 --> 5705.4
do

5716.239 --> 5718.718999999999
what

5717.119 --> 5720.96
what getting listen what are you talking

5718.719 --> 5720.96
about

5721.6 --> 5726.4400000000005
all right thanks kevlar see you later

5734.56 --> 5737.6
grabbling knowledge

5738.96 --> 5742.8
oh by the way that was hilarious owen

5741.04 --> 5745.92
benjamin yesterday

5742.8 --> 5745.92
he suggested that

5746.32 --> 5750.799999999999
tartaria was being maintained

5749.119 --> 5754.0
by

5750.8 --> 5757.1990000000005
by grabbling basically it was like

5754.0 --> 5759.119
put a dynamo into a grabbler's hand and

5757.199 --> 5761.36
then just tell him oh somebody took a

5759.119 --> 5761.36
loan

5761.84 --> 5766.4800000000005
and that then creates

5764.0 --> 5768.32
like electricity

5766.48 --> 5770.0
that is absorbed by the system so you

5768.32 --> 5772.0
just have to have like gravelers

5770.0 --> 5773.6
everywhere

5772.0 --> 5778.48
and then tell them

5773.6 --> 5778.4800000000005
stories about people getting loans and

5779.28 --> 5781.5199999999995
right

5782.08 --> 5787.639
that was freaking amazing joke thank you

5784.48 --> 5787.638999999999
for that

5819.76 --> 5823.76
where do you think the recent volcano

5821.92 --> 5824.96
photo yeah okay that's a pretty decent

5823.76 --> 5828.320000000001
question thank you for all these

5824.96 --> 5828.32
questions steamy traveler

5828.639 --> 5833.36
i think they were taken from a set loon

5830.96 --> 5835.6
i think that there are set loons up

5833.36 --> 5835.599999999999
there

5837.76 --> 5843.360000000001
and

5839.36 --> 5845.839999999999
that wore a drone like a special

5843.36 --> 5847.759999999999
spy plane drone type of thing could it

5845.84 --> 5849.6
could be two

5847.76 --> 5851.76
that was up there

5849.6 --> 5852.84
like that's just surveilling all the

5851.76 --> 5855.84
time

5852.84 --> 5858.4800000000005
yeah i think it's that it's not a

5855.84 --> 5858.4800000000005
satellite

5859.199 --> 5863.599999999999
but there's definitely eyes in the sky

5861.36 --> 5865.679
i'm pretty damn sure there are

5863.6 --> 5867.92
for a while now for decades it's been

5865.679 --> 5871.06
there

5867.92 --> 5871.06
[Music]

5891.44 --> 5894.44
hmm

5900.719 --> 5903.719
okay

5912.159 --> 5917.839999999999
just as google earth tells you taken

5914.239 --> 5917.839999999999
from airplanes what

5918.08 --> 5920.5599999999995
they do

5922.159 --> 5927.839999999999
right that makes sense that would be

5924.48 --> 5927.839999999999
properly honest of him

5928.56 --> 5933.360000000001
nasa lost it 50

5930.56 --> 5936.360000000001
do they oh free people free do they

5933.36 --> 5936.36
really

5940.0 --> 5945.119
yeah road man bro i i i gather that

5948.4 --> 5953.5599999999995
i'm not really interested in your video

5950.56 --> 5953.56
card

5962.61 --> 5965.799999999999
[Music]

5975.44 --> 5980.96
right jeff gassett yeah

5977.6 --> 5981.84
yeah the the solar powered

5980.96 --> 5984.32
just

5981.84 --> 5987.4400000000005
floaty drones and they can hang up there

5984.32 --> 5987.44
very long yeah yeah

5988.04 --> 5991.22
[Music]

5992.719 --> 5997.28
yeah all people free i know they're they

5994.88 --> 5999.6
have all that helium but that doesn't

5997.28 --> 6002.4
automatically mean that they send up 50

5999.6 --> 6002.400000000001
balloons a day

6004.48 --> 6009.599999999999
i mean they might do at some point like

6007.36 --> 6012.159
oh yeah we're gonna do a new

6009.6 --> 6013.76
satellite project send and then they're

6012.159 --> 6014.5599999999995
just gonna pump out a whole bunch of

6013.76 --> 6016.4800000000005
them

6014.56 --> 6018.4800000000005
that doesn't mean they do that every day

6016.48 --> 6020.959999999999
that's insane

6018.48 --> 6022.638999999999
if they do that every day at some point

6020.96 --> 6024.32
you're literally not going to be able to

6022.639 --> 6026.159000000001
see the sky anymore because it's

6024.32 --> 6030.32
literally

6026.159 --> 6030.32
just a giant layer of balloons

6030.48 --> 6035.36
right 50 a day

6033.6 --> 6040.280000000001
for 60 years

6035.36 --> 6040.28
is a lot of balloons

6057.84 --> 6060.84
so

6071.36 --> 6078.0
the balloon sphere that's right

6074.88 --> 6079.92
that's what it would become

6078.0 --> 6081.76
wouldn't even be able to see any of the

6079.92 --> 6086.2390000000005
celestials anymore because it would just

6081.76 --> 6086.2390000000005
be a giant cover of balloons

6087.84 --> 6091.1990000000005
and then god like can you imagine a

6090.159 --> 6093.119
storm

6091.199 --> 6093.919999999999
happening

6093.119 --> 6095.44
like

6093.92 --> 6097.52
nah that would actually kind of be

6095.44 --> 6099.5199999999995
problematic i think that would if there

6097.52 --> 6103.360000000001
would literally be a balloon layer like

6099.52 --> 6106.84
that that would darken the entire earth

6103.36 --> 6106.839999999999
that's not good

6121.52 --> 6124.52
hmm

6137.76 --> 6141.4400000000005
two cetloons use helium yeah they use

6140.08 --> 6143.76
helium

6141.44 --> 6143.759999999999
yes

6144.56 --> 6148.84
i doubt they're gonna use hydrogen

6153.04 --> 6156.0
they might but yeah

6154.8 --> 6158.159000000001
why

6156.0 --> 6161.8
not helium i think that helium is

6158.159 --> 6161.799999999999
probably more reliable

6165.04 --> 6171.119
while like hydrogen is extremely

6168.0 --> 6174.0
reactive like helium not reactive

6171.119 --> 6176.4
hydrogen the most reactive gas pretty

6174.0 --> 6178.8
much in the world maybe bar oxygen

6176.4 --> 6178.799999999999
itself

6187.28 --> 6192.0
how high can they get i don't know

6189.119 --> 6195.28
exactly very high though way above

6192.0 --> 6196.719
normal weather fronts

6195.28 --> 6200.92
that's why it kind of works because they

6196.719 --> 6200.92
can't just keep hanging there

6209.84 --> 6216.2390000000005
don't give bill gates any ideas oh god

6212.96 --> 6216.2390000000005
he's already had his no

6216.4 --> 6221.799999999999
i don't think he has too much longer to

6218.48 --> 6221.799999999999
go though

6240.32 --> 6244.639
the sky is horizontal what

6245.199 --> 6251.239
what

6247.84 --> 6251.2390000000005
what do you mean

6282.719 --> 6285.719
hmm

6290.79 --> 6294.88
[Music]

6292.96 --> 6296.88
yeah by the way i watched a

6294.88 --> 6299.84
also pretty good

6296.88 --> 6299.84
gerund video

6300.8 --> 6307.52
this morning as nasa lost its way

6304.48 --> 6307.5199999999995
it was a pretty good one

6308.159 --> 6312.799999999999
jaren has a lot of great clips

6311.04 --> 6316.159
that he's made over the years and he's

6312.8 --> 6318.400000000001
now just like harvesting his work pretty

6316.159 --> 6318.4
cool

6320.719 --> 6325.679
but yeah if you haven't checked that out

6322.88 --> 6325.679
it's pretty good

6327.44 --> 6331.159
let me post it

6336.88 --> 6340.639
vacuum balloons what

6342.4 --> 6347.92
what do you mean vacuum balloons

6344.639 --> 6347.92
that doesn't make any sense

6352.48 --> 6358.119
that's like saying

6354.48 --> 6358.119
freezing fire

6371.679 --> 6376.32
buttons go higher and lower due to

6373.6 --> 6379.119000000001
temperature in a day and night

6376.32 --> 6379.119
yeah perhaps

6379.84 --> 6384.4400000000005
but that shouldn't matter too much

6395.119 --> 6398.119
uh

6409.33 --> 6412.439
[Music]

6420.88 --> 6424.04
all right

6433.28 --> 6436.28

yeah thanks i'm not your fluffer thank

6444.48 --> 6450.199
you very much stanley stud

6447.199 --> 6450.199
gross

6461.04 --> 6465.92
man hi too

6463.76 --> 6468.92
look at the last u.s air force

6465.92 --> 6468.92
experiment

6470.4 --> 6472.719
hmm

6477.199 --> 6480.0
wasn't there like

6480.8 --> 6485.84
a movie about that

6482.719 --> 6485.84
called the right stuff

6486.639 --> 6491.119
it was about

6488.08 --> 6492.96
like this extreme test pilots isn't that

6491.119 --> 6496.599999999999
what you that's about there's a movie of

6492.96 --> 6496.6
that right wrath

6504.639 --> 6507.639
so

6517.76 --> 6523.04
did you know proofs

6520.0 --> 6526.4
exist only in math and logic not in

6523.04 --> 6529.28
science oh my god

6526.4 --> 6532.48
we got one

6529.28 --> 6532.48
we got another smurf

6535.04 --> 6538.04
[ __ ]

6548.719 --> 6554.2390000000005
what the hell

6550.96 --> 6555.92
no stanley stud you're exactly wrong is

6554.239 --> 6558.159
exactly the opposite of everything

6555.92 --> 6560.4
you've said so far

6558.159 --> 6564.638999999999
you are wrong everything you said is

6560.4 --> 6569.08
exactly 180 degrees wrong

6564.639 --> 6569.08
you get zero f

6575.28 --> 6578.08
yeah

6576.08 --> 6580.4
it is the stupid comment of the day

6578.08 --> 6583.84
indeed george sanford

6580.4 --> 6586.08
did you know proofs exist only in math

6583.84 --> 6588.2390000000005
and logic not in science yeah that

6586.08 --> 6590.4
definitely

6588.239 --> 6594.239
that's definitely the winner of today's

6590.4 --> 6594.239
dumbest comment for sure

6594.48 --> 6599.119
now you're delusional

6596.639 --> 6601.599
in this case that's actually true that's

6599.119 --> 6603.598999999999
not an at-home you are delusional you

6601.599 --> 6605.599
live in a reversed world you turn

6603.599 --> 6609.4400000000005
everything around

6605.599 --> 6611.599
till it makes absolutely no more sense

6609.44 --> 6614.719
you don't have any backing for that

6611.599 --> 6618.56
statement again except for other people

6614.719 --> 6618.56
blabbering and lying to you

6619.599 --> 6624.400000000001
maybe try working in smurf you might

6621.92 --> 6626.4
understand yeah i know smurf

6624.4 --> 6629.36
i know everything you smurf is

6626.4 --> 6632.5599999999995
everything you can smurf

6629.36 --> 6633.5199999999995
proves everything but

6632.56 --> 6636.159000000001
you know

6633.52 --> 6637.119000000001
the smurf method doesn't prove anything

6636.159 --> 6640.08
right

6637.119 --> 6641.598999999999
it's all smurf it's okay you know it's

6640.08 --> 6642.639
just smurf

6641.599 --> 6645.4400000000005
i know

6642.639 --> 6645.4400000000005
you're a smurf

6646.56 --> 6650.96
you're definitely not somebody who

6648.48 --> 6652.4
understands what science is

6650.96 --> 6654.0
because you think anything can be

6652.4 --> 6657.36
science but it doesn't prove anything

6654.0 --> 6657.36
that makes you a smurf

6660.639 --> 6665.719
get the [ __ ] out of here

6662.719 --> 6665.719
scum

6678.35 --> 6681.509
[Music]

6684.48 --> 6689.04
right yeah but it was definitely worth

6686.719 --> 6691.44
reading that out just to have that on

6689.04 --> 6694.239
record on how incredibly stupid and

6691.44 --> 6697.119
insane

6694.239 --> 6697.119
these trolls are

6697.28 --> 6702.239
because yeah there's not going to be

6698.719 --> 6705.04
anything left like when they go

6702.239 --> 6707.919999999999
and say things like

6705.04 --> 6709.36
you be you just don't get upset when

6707.92 --> 6711.119
other people don't agree with your

6709.36 --> 6714.08
delusion yeah yeah except that

6711.119 --> 6717.679
everything that i say is backed

6714.08 --> 6722.32
and everything you're saying is made up

6717.679 --> 6724.2390000000005
180 degrees from truth provably so you

6722.32 --> 6725.119
can look it up everything you said is

6724.239 --> 6726.32
wrong

6725.119 --> 6730.799999999999
it's wrong

6726.32 --> 6731.92
you're an idiot provably an idiot

6730.8 --> 6733.28
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

6731.92 --> 6736.159
talking about you don't have any

6733.28 --> 6738.88
reference you can't quote that you can

6736.159 --> 6742.879999999999
only quote other people that knowing and

6738.88 --> 6742.88
provingly lie about it

6745.28 --> 6748.96
yeah the smurf thing is new yeah i take

6747.44 --> 6753.759999999999
full credit

6748.96 --> 6756.2390000000005
my what tico sack says that's mine

6753.76 --> 6757.599
that's mine you hear me owen but you can

6756.239 --> 6759.04
use it

6757.599 --> 6761.679
it's mine though

6759.04 --> 6763.199
i made it up

6761.679 --> 6765.76
yeah

6763.199 --> 6766.879999999999
science to the ballers is

6765.76 --> 6770.639
smurf

6766.88 --> 6772.2390000000005
that's what it is it's all smurf

6770.639 --> 6774.719
because

6772.239 --> 6776.959999999999
yeah you can smurf anything

6774.719 --> 6778.4
but the smurf method doesn't prove

6776.96 --> 6780.159
anything though

6778.4 --> 6782.799999999999
but it doesn't matter because everything

6780.159 --> 6786.239
is smurf you can smurf anything

6782.8 --> 6787.52
you can like oh look at this i'm this is

6786.239 --> 6790.718999999999
smurf see

6787.52 --> 6791.679
i'm smurfing this is smurf

6790.719 --> 6794.56
right

6791.679 --> 6797.76
throw it it drops that's smurf

6794.56 --> 6800.0
that's exactly what it is

6797.76 --> 6802.0
that's what they're doing

6800.0 --> 6805.0
smurf wins

6802.0 --> 6805.0
okay

6833.199 --> 6836.719
i'm smurf smacking

6837.199 --> 6841.119
i just want to make soup out of him

6844.96 --> 6851.44
right magic smurf

6846.84 --> 6851.4400000000005
brew because apparently i'm gargamel

6857.599 --> 6864.32
and in the context of that joke i do not

6860.0 --> 6864.32
mind being compared with gargamel

6864.48 --> 6870.159
because he is the ultimate nemesis of

6866.96 --> 6870.159
the smurfs after all

6873.36 --> 6877.839999999999
smurf winism

6875.36 --> 6877.839999999999
god

6879.76 --> 6884.52
it's getting a little overkill there

6896.639 --> 6899.84
how did smurfs procreate only once more

6899.04 --> 6902.56
fat

6899.84 --> 6905.76
well maybe

6902.56 --> 6908.159000000001
the smurfs just like people out here

6905.76 --> 6910.96
actually like maybe smurfette was

6908.159 --> 6913.36
actually the only male and they were all

6910.96 --> 6915.04
female

6913.36 --> 6919.0
right

6915.04 --> 6919.0
have you ever considered that

6920.96 --> 6924.719
maybe they had like

6922.639 --> 6927.28
i don't even want to go there but

6924.719 --> 6928.96
it would make more sense if like they

6927.28 --> 6929.92
could all basically

6928.96 --> 6932.0
just

6929.92 --> 6934.2390000000005
make little smurfs and all they needed

6932.0 --> 6936.96
was to get inspired by smurfette that's

6934.239 --> 6938.32
what she was always doing

6936.96 --> 6941.28
being there being beautiful and

6938.32 --> 6941.28
everything like ah

6945.199 --> 6948.239
i remember that episode where like

6946.96 --> 6950.159
everybody

6948.239 --> 6954.159
was falling in love with her because of

6950.159 --> 6954.159
something that was hilarious

6955.36 --> 6958.4
you just smurfed it

6958.56 --> 6964.400000000001
and giving this show two smurfs up oh

6961.04 --> 6967.599
god what have i done

6964.4 --> 6970.4
it's a smurf plague breaking out

6967.599 --> 6973.56
now everything is smurf god i knew this

6970.4 --> 6973.5599999999995
would happen

6981.84 --> 6986.56
right and that's why you shouldn't talk

6984.32 --> 6988.88
like smurfs talk because before you know

6986.56 --> 6990.56
it you're a smurf

6988.88 --> 6992.32
right

6990.56 --> 6994.159000000001
just like

6992.32 --> 6997.44
there's people that say science doesn't

6994.159 --> 6999.44
prove anything but everything is science

6997.44 --> 7002.159
everything you do is science and it

6999.44 --> 7004.159
doesn't prove anything though right if

7002.159 --> 7007.28
you start to think that that's okay that

7004.159 --> 7009.598999999999
that's that that's the real thing and

7007.28 --> 7011.599
you're gonna echo that and act on that

7009.599 --> 7014.2390000000005
and spread that

7011.599 --> 7016.400000000001
that insight you think you have

7014.239 --> 7019.199
you are just like a smurf you've become

7016.4 --> 7019.199
a smurf now

7019.36 --> 7022.5599999999995
you're one of them

7021.04 --> 7025.04
somebody that doesn't understand

7022.56 --> 7025.04
anything

7025.84 --> 7031.84
oh my god i've got another one

7028.639 --> 7031.84
got another smurf

7032.239 --> 7036.879999999999
yeah it's pretty basically wrong

7037.199 --> 7042.32
science is a method it proves the cause

7040.32 --> 7043.759999999999
of an effect

7042.32 --> 7046.719
which has to be

7043.76 --> 7048.719
a natural phenomenon

7046.719 --> 7051.28
naturally occurring phenomena not

7048.719 --> 7053.52
man-made and then the experimenter has

7051.28 --> 7056.96
to very manipulate it in order to

7053.52 --> 7060.96
establish it being the cause of the

7056.96 --> 7064.2390000000005
effect that's the scientific method

7060.96 --> 7066.639
the only thing science does is prove

7064.239 --> 7066.638999999999
things

7066.8 --> 7071.0
it's the only thing it does

7072.239 --> 7079.879999999999
and if you say anything else you're

7074.639 --> 7079.88
wrong you're an idiot or you're a liar

7097.119 --> 7101.839999999999
no that's that's ridiculous

7099.599 --> 7101.84
no

7102.159 --> 7107.04
because there could be variables that

7104.0 --> 7109.84
doesn't matter it doesn't matter if

7107.04 --> 7112.0
there's variables unaccounted for

7109.84 --> 7113.04
the whole point is

7112.0 --> 7116.639
is

7113.04 --> 7119.599
you take a variable and then you see if

7116.639 --> 7122.719
it causes the effect it doesn't matter

7119.599 --> 7124.32
there might be other influences it

7122.719 --> 7128.56
doesn't matter the only thing that

7124.32 --> 7131.5199999999995
matters is whether the thing

7128.56 --> 7133.4400000000005
the phenomenon that you very manipulate

7131.52 --> 7136.719
causes it that's the only thing that

7133.44 --> 7138.4
matters to science not that oh but there

7136.719 --> 7140.08
are a thousand other things that can

7138.4 --> 7141.92
influence yeah it's completely

7140.08 --> 7145.679
irrelevant because the only thing you're

7141.92 --> 7147.92
trying to do is prove the cause of the

7145.679 --> 7149.599
effect by varying

7147.92 --> 7152.56
and manipulating

7149.599 --> 7155.679
one variable to see if it

7152.56 --> 7158.080000000001
is the cause of the effect idiot

7155.679 --> 7160.32
happy to help you're not helping anybody

7158.08 --> 7164.239
you're being completely incorrect you're

7160.32 --> 7166.5599999999995
being a bald heart you're being a smurf

7164.239 --> 7170.08
we're not happy with your help you're an

7166.56 --> 7171.76
idiot and a zealot and you echo [ __ ]

7170.08 --> 7173.76
nonsense

7171.76 --> 7176.159000000001
that doesn't mean anything

7173.76 --> 7177.92
that's not even officially accepted it's

7176.159 --> 7179.199
all just a bunch of philosophical

7177.92 --> 7182.159
squirting

7179.199 --> 7184.879999999999
by heliocentrists and atheists that want

7182.159 --> 7186.96
people to be [ __ ]

7184.88 --> 7189.28
so they can be god and play god over

7186.96 --> 7190.88
them that's what you're echoing now

7189.28 --> 7192.4
you're a smurf you don't know what the

7190.88 --> 7194.96
[ __ ] you're talking about you don't

7192.4 --> 7197.04
understand what science is

7194.96 --> 7198.639
and you've programmed you've or allowed

7197.04 --> 7201.5199999999995
yourself to become programmed with

7198.639 --> 7204.96
exactly the opposite of everything that

7201.52 --> 7206.719
it is and why it was even created it was

7204.96 --> 7208.8
created

7206.719 --> 7211.76
to prevent the [ __ ]

7208.8 --> 7215.1990000000005
that you're doing with it from happening

7211.76 --> 7217.1990000000005
in order to give a solid physical anchor

7215.199 --> 7219.119
point for knowledge called the

7217.199 --> 7222.32
scientific method

7219.119 --> 7224.719
to prove causes of effects of naturally

7222.32 --> 7228.5599999999995
occurring phenomena and you don't know

7224.719 --> 7230.719
what the [ __ ] you're talking about

7228.56 --> 7230.719
so

7231.36 --> 7235.44
you're a theist well then you're a

7232.88 --> 7237.84
[ __ ]

7235.44 --> 7240.48
that's even more embarrassing then

7237.84 --> 7242.8
you don't know what you're saying

7240.48 --> 7244.879999999999
been in yeah you've been in smurf

7242.8 --> 7248.08
you've been a smurf for 30 years you've

7244.88 --> 7251.119
been misinformed misled

7248.08 --> 7253.04
indoctrinated into a philosophical

7251.119 --> 7256.08
delusion land

7253.04 --> 7257.36
for 30 years yeah i know you're wrong

7256.08 --> 7259.84
you're wrong

7257.36 --> 7261.92
i don't give a [ __ ] what you think you

7259.84 --> 7264.0
know and how long

7261.92 --> 7266.0
you've been doing that [ __ ] it's

7264.0 --> 7269.44
wrong you've been misinformed you've

7266.0 --> 7272.48
been lied to and you've accepted it and

7269.44 --> 7275.799999999999
now you're just chanting like a smurf

7272.48 --> 7275.799999999999
you're wrong

7283.52 --> 7288.159000000001
yeah good luck take care yeah i will

7287.119 --> 7289.679
yeah

7288.159 --> 7292.239
can't say the same for you because

7289.679 --> 7294.84
you're wrong and you will

7292.239 --> 7296.879999999999
officially be recognized as

7294.84 --> 7299.52
wrong yeah

7296.88 --> 7301.76
so you don't have to bluff your way in

7299.52 --> 7303.76
to some place saying oh i'm a scientist

7301.76 --> 7305.52
i've been doing this for so long

7303.76 --> 7307.4400000000005
yet i don't even understand what the

7305.52 --> 7308.96
scientific method is

7307.44 --> 7311.44
and i think that science doesn't prove

7308.96 --> 7313.119
anything yeah why don't you try that and

7311.44 --> 7315.04
at a physics

7313.119 --> 7317.36
university

7315.04 --> 7318.239
see what they're going to say about that

7317.36 --> 7321.44
yeah and

7318.239 --> 7324.4
record that yeah let's record their

7321.44 --> 7327.36
responses let them see go like

7324.4 --> 7329.598999999999
yeah that's been popularly said but it's

7327.36 --> 7331.28
actually not true because it isn't

7329.599 --> 7333.84
because you're wrong

7331.28 --> 7335.84
you're wrong robert digital you're

7333.84 --> 7338.32
incorrect

7335.84 --> 7342.08
and if that makes you incorrect for 30

7338.32 --> 7342.08
years that's pretty damn pathetic

7342.159 --> 7349.239
you're wrong for 30 years apparently

7345.599 --> 7349.2390000000005
that's really pathetic

7353.76 --> 7359.52
yeah evidence helps yeah as in

7356.56 --> 7361.679
historically recorded

7359.52 --> 7364.84
information about what the scientific

7361.679 --> 7368.4
method is who came up with it why it was

7364.84 --> 7370.639
created when it was created what is

7368.4 --> 7374.08
actually scientifically proven

7370.639 --> 7376.719
and then you get all these squirty

7374.08 --> 7378.88
philosophical spin doctor [ __ ]

7376.719 --> 7381.119
blabbering documents

7378.88 --> 7382.96
that's gonna explain no it's whatever

7381.119 --> 7385.92
the [ __ ] you want now science is

7382.96 --> 7387.84
liberated now we've liberated science

7385.92 --> 7390.0
yeah yeah liberated

7387.84 --> 7391.84
from actually being science and turning

7390.0 --> 7395.84
it into [ __ ]

7391.84 --> 7397.84
smurf cake it's all just smurf cake just

7395.84 --> 7399.76
a bunch of smurf berries making smurf

7397.84 --> 7401.4400000000005
cake it has nothing to do with science

7399.76 --> 7403.679
at all

7401.44 --> 7406.5599999999995
you don't know what science is

7403.679 --> 7408.96
you've been led to believe

7406.56 --> 7410.320000000001
that science can be anything it isn't

7408.96 --> 7412.8
you're wrong

7410.32 --> 7412.799999999999
it isn't

7414.56 --> 7419.4400000000005
that approach is cultural

7417.36 --> 7423.28
philosophical

7419.44 --> 7425.44
it's not science it's not physics you

7423.28 --> 7427.44
are wrong

7425.44 --> 7431.36
get over it

7427.44 --> 7431.36
or not then just [ __ ] off

7435.04 --> 7440.719
all right

7437.28 --> 7442.88

7447.599 --> 7451.28
not as much energy as i had yesterday i

7449.52 --> 7453.280000000001
don't know why

7451.28 --> 7455.5199999999995
