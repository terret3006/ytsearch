good morning

48.719 --> 52.719

chat and the membership system join

73.6 --> 79.36
button they'll be much appreciated

76.96 --> 81.6
right uh sorry for starting a little

79.36 --> 81.6
late

83.92 --> 89.43900000000001
the weather today is quite a contrast to

86.799 --> 89.43900000000001
yesterday

90.56 --> 95.52
dreary and raining it's constantly

93.28 --> 100.159
raining

95.52 --> 104.479
so yeah

100.159 --> 107.28
wet rainy day out there

104.479 --> 107.28
not too great

107.52 --> 110.0
oh well

111.52 --> 115.84
hey what's this

116.96 --> 120.32
whoa that was weird

121.439 --> 125.36
that was really weird the camera just

123.36 --> 128.959
went dark

125.36 --> 130.72
but it's back to normal anyway let's see

128.959 --> 134.2
who is in chat first

130.72 --> 143.84
m was first and donsky

134.2 --> 143.83999999999997
0150 151

149.68 --> 152.31900000000002
okay

152.72 --> 156.8
all right yeah i'd appreciate it if

154.56 --> 160.959
you'd stop posting

156.8 --> 162.8
troll videos if you keep it up i'm gonna

160.959 --> 164.239
just ban you because i know you've

162.8 --> 167.28
commented that

164.239 --> 168.72
it's not interesting it's old videos by

167.28 --> 170.4
the way i thought they were new but

168.72 --> 170.8
there's just they're over three years

170.4 --> 173.84
old

170.8 --> 173.84
so goody

175.36 --> 182.4
um right i got some coffee

178.56 --> 187.04
as you just saw green tea

182.4 --> 189.519
and breakfast buns

187.04 --> 193.28
also part of why it was a little late

189.519 --> 193.28
because i stepped over my routine

196.84 --> 201.519
okay

198.159 --> 201.519
well don't

203.76 --> 210.84
okay well donsky might not realize

207.599 --> 215.04
how this chat works

210.84 --> 218.48
right i basically just

215.04 --> 221.12
gave you the conditions

218.48 --> 221.92
that you don't have to mouth me over

221.12 --> 224.08
that

221.92 --> 226.95899999999997
because this is my show i do things the

224.08 --> 229.28
way i do them

226.959 --> 229.28
right

231.76 --> 234.879
anyway it's monday

238.84 --> 241.84
and

243.91 --> 250.56
[Music]

246.72 --> 253.92
a new week no chances and it's the 21st

250.56 --> 255.76
so we'll see what happens it doesn't

253.92 --> 258.079
look like anything special is gonna

255.76 --> 258.079
happen

259.919 --> 265.75899999999996
but except for maybe the the conjunction

263.44 --> 268.4
of the planets which are supposed to

265.759 --> 271.28000000000003
happen somewhere today i think

268.4 --> 271.67999999999995
if i the rumors i heard were correct did

271.28 --> 275.44
not

271.68 --> 275.44
go out to confirm any of it

280.84 --> 283.84
hmm

284.56 --> 297.84
right so where is everyone

306.64 --> 313.12
[Music]

309.28 --> 316.71999999999997
so maybe it's gonna start a little slow

313.12 --> 318.96
did not happen years ago

316.72 --> 318.96000000000004
what

320.0 --> 328.0
hey zack sterling

324.639 --> 330.08
flatter stuff seven day roll

328.0 --> 332.72
all right so you're you're just

330.08 --> 336.84
gathering all the information

332.72 --> 341.68
that's heavy welcome to the scene zack

336.84 --> 341.67999999999995
sterling a cameron kamikaze gilmore

350.56 --> 354.8
all right oh what are you looking for

354.96 --> 357.84
maybe i can help

358.8 --> 367.84000000000003
i'm here to answer questions

375.12 --> 380.639
i mean like are you on the fence do you

377.84 --> 383.35999999999996
have doubts or are you just

380.639 --> 383.36
where are you at

384.0 --> 390.24
you saw odd odd and eric dubay

387.919 --> 392.0
all right well that's certainly just a

390.24 --> 392.84000000000003
start that doesn't really explain

392.0 --> 395.84
everything

392.84 --> 401.039
because some of eric debase stuff

395.84 --> 404.31899999999996
is not perfect odd i don't even know

401.039 --> 407.36
been heard from him in a long time

404.319 --> 409.84000000000003
zero doubts okay so what is it you're

407.36 --> 409.84000000000003
researching

412.0 --> 419.52
oh god another troll

416.08 --> 420.4
why do i have 33 in my email because i

419.52 --> 422.96
chose to

420.4 --> 424.08
because i wanted to because i like the

422.96 --> 427.19899999999996
number 33

424.08 --> 427.199
it's a special number

435.68 --> 439.12
and as a side note i did it especially

438.8 --> 443.12
so

439.12 --> 445.199
squirters like you would start squirting

443.12 --> 446.88
so i don't have to deal with it later

445.199 --> 449.68
that you are squirters

446.88 --> 451.599
i'll just get a head start by just

449.68 --> 453.52
noticing that you are squirting over it

451.599 --> 456.0
and then i already know where i am at

453.52 --> 456.0
with you

462.84 --> 466.71999999999997
uh here we go again

468.4 --> 471.919
and george sanford by the way

473.039 --> 477.199
oh wait yeah you're already there just

476.08 --> 481.35999999999996
wanting to consume

477.199 --> 485.039
any flatter stuff consume flatter stuff

481.36 --> 487.599
how does that work oh

485.039 --> 490.31899999999996
okay if you want some real cosmogeny

487.599 --> 492.71999999999997
detail if you're really that open-minded

490.319 --> 494.47900000000004
i'd recommend if you can find the

492.72 --> 498.72
patience for it

494.479 --> 503.28
to watch some of my older videos

498.72 --> 503.28000000000003
as well because i've been

503.36 --> 509.599
discussing and sort of championing the

506.4 --> 512.7189999999999
rectangular looping model

509.599 --> 515.12
which is i guess popularly also referred

512.719 --> 517.839
to as the pacman model

515.12 --> 518.159
and it is kind of the start of a premise

517.839 --> 521.2790000000001
of

518.159 --> 523.519
possibilities that i have discussed as

521.279 --> 527.12
elaborately as i can

523.519 --> 531.76
for years even though most of it i

527.12 --> 534.48
feel false the death air death ears

531.76 --> 537.8389999999999
but maybe later it will be more

534.48 --> 537.839
appreciated and useful

538.16 --> 545.36
and yeah i basically discussed how a

541.36 --> 548.88
looping confined nature to the realm

545.36 --> 552.64
uh yeah reveals all kinds of

548.88 --> 553.279
unknowns and potential possibilities of

552.64 --> 555.68
what the

553.279 --> 558.0
actual layout of the realm is in the

555.68 --> 561.1999999999999
euclidean sense

558.0 --> 564.0
with looping borders

561.2 --> 566.24
sounds a bit weird but yeah it spent a

564.0 --> 569.519
lot of time explaining it

566.24 --> 572.0
how that basically can help us

569.519 --> 573.839
understand what this realm really is how

572.0 --> 577.839
it works

573.839 --> 577.839
and also i've

578.72 --> 584.48
discussed a lot about the psychological

581.04 --> 585.92
problems that people will typically face

584.48 --> 588.32
and one of them for example is

585.92 --> 591.1999999999999
physicality assumption bias it's like

588.32 --> 594.1600000000001
the main obstacle for most people that

591.2 --> 596.8000000000001
start to dig into flat earth is that

594.16 --> 598.959
we're all raised in a world where it is

596.8 --> 599.4399999999999
constantly said like it's all figured

598.959 --> 602.399
out

599.44 --> 603.2790000000001
and then we eventually we start to

602.399 --> 607.279
intuitive

603.279 --> 607.279
or emotionally rely on that

607.519 --> 614.079
and a lot of people then even

610.56 --> 614.079
think from that premise

615.44 --> 619.0400000000001
and use it as a defense mechanism to

617.68 --> 622.0
prevent themselves from

619.04 --> 624.3199999999999
ascending further and figuring it out

622.0 --> 626.56
because there is no necessity for it

624.32 --> 629.12
because it's all figured out see it's

626.56 --> 632.0
part of the conditioning and

629.12 --> 632.399
things that come from all these things

632.0 --> 634.88
is

632.399 --> 636.72
physicality assumption bias to basically

634.88 --> 639.12
see something and then immediately

636.72 --> 642.8000000000001
assume it's a physical object

639.12 --> 644.9590000000001
because you can identify physical traits

642.8 --> 646.7199999999999
or because you simply cannot imagine it

644.959 --> 648.56
to be anything else than a physical

646.72 --> 650.88
object because it reminds you of it

648.56 --> 652.399
or because it's been constantly told to

650.88 --> 655.68
you

652.399 --> 659.44
now first thing where this

655.68 --> 661.92
becomes apparent is when

659.44 --> 663.0400000000001
gazing at the heavens and the stars and

661.92 --> 666.24
the sun and the moon

663.04 --> 669.5999999999999
all these celestial lights or luminaries

666.24 --> 672.72
as the bible refers them to

669.6 --> 676.399
have been in heliocentrism

672.72 --> 679.6800000000001
been turned into physical objects

676.399 --> 680.0
and compared to the place we're standing

679.68 --> 683.4399999999999
in

680.0 --> 685.279
and on earth as one of those same type

683.44 --> 686.0790000000001
of physical objects and it's all around

685.279 --> 689.2
because

686.079 --> 690.2399999999999
one of the things about celestial lights

689.2 --> 693.6
is that they look

690.24 --> 695.839
round and when you see something and it

693.6 --> 698.64
looks round then it's very easy to just

695.839 --> 700.8800000000001
in your mind make that three-dimensional

698.64 --> 702.56
when the premise is given to you that

700.88 --> 704.24
they are the same objects as you're

702.56 --> 705.76
standing on and oh look it's round so it

704.24 --> 707.44
must be a sphere then

705.76 --> 709.2
so then we can assume we're standing on

707.44 --> 710.9590000000001
the sphere it's part of the process of

709.2 --> 714.399
the conditioning

710.959 --> 716.959
it's guiding the road

714.399 --> 718.399
of your train of thought through the

716.959 --> 722.0
model

718.399 --> 724.24
to close off or automatically

722.0 --> 727.2
make you close off condition you to

724.24 --> 730.399
close off possibilities

727.2 --> 732.9590000000001
and realizations because things follow

730.399 --> 735.04
this pattern in the conditioning

732.959 --> 738.6389999999999
through physicality assumption bias so

735.04 --> 738.639
that's also an important factor

742.839 --> 746.5600000000001
huh

744.56 --> 748.8
i guess we can't assume anything yeah

746.56 --> 750.16
but the bible model is not really a

748.8 --> 755.3599999999999
model

750.16 --> 755.36
it's not people that say it's a model

755.92 --> 760.639
they're they're just trying to close the

758.959 --> 763.8389999999999
gaps

760.639 --> 765.519
in their minds to make it into a model

763.839 --> 767.839
i don't think it's really a complete

765.519 --> 768.9590000000001
model there's just some hints at it but

767.839 --> 772.1600000000001
it's not

768.959 --> 774.079
it's not complete doesn't give you all

772.16 --> 777.4399999999999
the information you truly need

774.079 --> 779.5999999999999
to finalize to really close those gaps

777.44 --> 782.5600000000001
so people just start filling them in

779.6 --> 784.24
using physicality assumption bias and

782.56 --> 787.5999999999999
then they turned it into that

784.24 --> 790.5600000000001
disk with a dome over it

787.6 --> 792.32
when there's no conclusive proof that

790.56 --> 801.8389999999999
even the realms layout

792.32 --> 801.839
is like this despite all the maps

806.24 --> 810.8
200 proofs were debunked oh sure

811.44 --> 820.399
sure it's all debunked of course it is

817.04 --> 824.24
all right now it's not perfect there are

820.399 --> 824.24
some weird assumptions in there

824.56 --> 831.92
but yeah most of it is is good enough

828.48 --> 834.5600000000001
especially for an intro introduction

831.92 --> 836.3199999999999
right so i don't mind all the trolls all

834.56 --> 837.1199999999999
the baller trolls and they keep going

836.32 --> 838.8000000000001
around they

837.12 --> 840.5600000000001
all they do is just say no it's all

838.8 --> 842.399
debunked it's all about they never

840.56 --> 843.76
actually prove anything or give any

842.399 --> 847.519
arguments for their

843.76 --> 850.3199999999999
claims and they are very proficient

847.519 --> 851.44
in talking around a subject and not

850.32 --> 854.32
answering it

851.44 --> 855.519
and distracting you from that fact so

854.32 --> 857.6
that's something you're gonna have to

855.519 --> 859.68
deal with but you've probably already

857.6 --> 861.6
figured that out because they really get

859.68 --> 865.519
in your face right away

861.6 --> 868.9590000000001
when you appear they can feel a newbie

865.519 --> 868.9590000000001
just as we can feel it

869.199 --> 872.24
the flat earthers

872.8 --> 877.68
should read it before i talk all right

879.04 --> 882.24
who is mark sergeant oh mark sergeant is

881.6 --> 886.32
a

882.24 --> 889.199
kind of a youtuber

886.32 --> 890.5600000000001
who for many people on the internet

889.199 --> 893.5999999999999
spread it around

890.56 --> 896.959
so he was kind of in the same time as

893.6 --> 898.639
eric the bay one of the first ones to

896.959 --> 901.04
basically open the doors

898.639 --> 902.399
and just give a basic conception to the

901.04 --> 905.519
world

902.399 --> 908.399
about flat earth and

905.519 --> 910.16
i like mark sargent more than i like

908.399 --> 911.519
eric dubay because eric dubay was good

910.16 --> 914.7199999999999
but i just

911.519 --> 915.839
i think well i just thought he was a

914.72 --> 919.279
little bit annoying

915.839 --> 919.2790000000001
and thought he was not

919.68 --> 926.4799999999999
wise in his actions like he had a

923.199 --> 929.519
eric debe always has like a weird

926.48 --> 931.6
hostility and it's

929.519 --> 933.839
understandable because hey the world has

931.6 --> 936.9590000000001
fooled you blah blah blah all that right

933.839 --> 940.5600000000001
but how he approached it was

936.959 --> 941.68
what we've later kind of figured out

940.56 --> 944.959
psychologically

941.68 --> 946.56
he's a little bit of a savage now that's

944.959 --> 948.079
made that's a word you might have never

946.56 --> 951.68
heard before uh cervani

948.079 --> 951.68
is basically a person that gets

952.079 --> 959.68
like obsessed with the enemy

955.759 --> 961.36
and yeah typical traits are paranoia

959.68 --> 963.5999999999999
and that doesn't mean they're stupid or

961.36 --> 965.44
anything right it's just a natural

963.6 --> 967.6800000000001
position of the psyche

965.44 --> 969.36
people that get obsessed with the enemy

967.68 --> 970.8
and then they start to see everything as

969.36 --> 974.0
the enemy

970.8 --> 977.04
now eric dubay is not that bad

974.0 --> 980.48
but he is infamously

977.04 --> 982.56
surrounded by people that are really bad

980.48 --> 984.24
and that constantly just declared

982.56 --> 985.3599999999999
everybody's chills that was like the

984.24 --> 987.279
whole shtick

985.36 --> 989.12
with eric to bay in the first few years

987.279 --> 991.04
just calling everything and everybody

989.12 --> 992.8
shills

991.04 --> 995.04
saying that oh they're all the other

992.8 --> 998.8
flat earthers all controlled opposition

995.04 --> 1002.0
because they disagreed about some detail

998.8 --> 1003.7589999999999
and now i call that and some others to

1002.0 --> 1006.399
maybe or they'll at least understand

1003.759 --> 1009.6800000000001
what i mean call that savage

1006.399 --> 1012.16
doesn't make him a evil person

1009.68 --> 1014.16
or on the wrong side it's just like a

1012.16 --> 1016.56
psychological problem and a lot of flat

1014.16 --> 1019.36
earthers have that

1016.56 --> 1021.3599999999999
and also non-flat earthers for example

1019.36 --> 1025.28
mind of god here is a

1021.36 --> 1027.199
totally drowned safanye like he is

1025.28 --> 1028.799
he'll never get out so he's just a

1027.199 --> 1032.0790000000002
complete squirter now

1028.799 --> 1033.199
spends all his time just making negative

1032.079 --> 1036.48
videos about

1033.199 --> 1040.0790000000002
other people there's barely any point

1036.48 --> 1042.72
left to it that that's what happens

1040.079 --> 1044.24
sophonia syndrome could be very much

1042.72 --> 1047.439
compared to

1044.24 --> 1049.44
devil persecution syndrome that some

1047.439 --> 1051.6000000000001
christians are afflicted by they get

1049.44 --> 1052.0
obsessed with trying to find sin and

1051.6 --> 1054.08
they

1052.0 --> 1055.44
start nagging people over it even their

1054.08 --> 1058.48
own family

1055.44 --> 1061.3600000000001
right it's very similar to that effect

1058.48 --> 1061.3600000000001
that position

1061.44 --> 1067.28
but it's more about the internet it's

1065.44 --> 1067.919
also has to do with the difference

1067.28 --> 1071.039
between

1067.919 --> 1072.72
internet communication communicating

1071.039 --> 1074.0
over the internet and communicating

1072.72 --> 1075.919
face-to-face because there's a

1074.0 --> 1079.6
difference to that

1075.919 --> 1082.88
and savonia is typically an internet

1079.6 --> 1084.08
thing although yeah plenty of people do

1082.88 --> 1087.1200000000001
it face to face too

1084.08 --> 1087.12
and cause a ruckus

1088.15 --> 1091.279
[Music]

1092.72 --> 1095.84
what the

1096.0 --> 1100.16
wow trolls are strong today

1100.48 --> 1104.0
eric today is obviously a plan yeah see

1103.28 --> 1106.32
it's so

1104.0 --> 1107.36
funny when i talk about something and

1106.32 --> 1110.0
the people that i

1107.36 --> 1111.12
even give as an example instantly prove

1110.0 --> 1123.84
my point

1111.12 --> 1123.84
see what i'm talking about

1129.039 --> 1136.48
well a troll well zack sterling

1132.64 --> 1138.88
i guess you could call it a troll but

1136.48 --> 1140.48
people can be trolls from all kinds of

1138.88 --> 1144.0800000000002
vantage points

1140.48 --> 1146.88
you know a lot of trolls are just people

1144.08 --> 1147.6
that don't know how to deal with certain

1146.88 --> 1149.5200000000002
elements

1147.6 --> 1151.6
certain needs they have so they go

1149.52 --> 1153.039
anonymously they have a normal life

1151.6 --> 1155.6
and they keep it completely to

1153.039 --> 1157.679
themselves and then they on the internet

1155.6 --> 1159.36
just go and attack a certain group and

1157.679 --> 1161.2
just make fun of them like complete

1159.36 --> 1164.559
bullies or whatever

1161.2 --> 1166.799
as as best they can that's a troll

1164.559 --> 1169.2
this is different because these people

1166.799 --> 1173.12
are sometimes just not even anonymous

1169.2 --> 1175.1200000000001
they're just on camera doing that

1173.12 --> 1177.52
and then it's not it's not just like a

1175.12 --> 1177.52
troll

1177.76 --> 1181.44
it's more personal more serious it's not

1180.08 --> 1183.9189999999999
just secretly

1181.44 --> 1185.919
trying to get some needs off your chest

1183.919 --> 1189.2
and all that

1185.919 --> 1192.5590000000002
which is what most trolls are

1189.2 --> 1196.64
like a lot of people have or

1192.559 --> 1199.84
gain troll needs at times i i really

1196.64 --> 1201.44
i don't do that i've never been a

1199.84 --> 1202.6399999999999
proponent but i've always been very

1201.44 --> 1206.48
proud

1202.64 --> 1209.039
to represent myself as i do things

1206.48 --> 1210.32
but yeah when you get very stressed out

1209.039 --> 1213.36
and people are like

1210.32 --> 1215.28
attacking you or slandering you

1213.36 --> 1216.7199999999998
or there's a lot of infighting going on

1215.28 --> 1219.039
then some people

1216.72 --> 1220.0
have the need to basically make an

1219.039 --> 1224.799
anonymous account

1220.0 --> 1227.44
and then start trolling others so yeah

1224.799 --> 1227.44
it's different

1230.32 --> 1235.76
the moon landings were fake but now i

1232.96 --> 1238.0
have no doubt it's ridiculous yeah

1235.76 --> 1239.039
well the moon landings were always weird

1238.0 --> 1242.64
but

1239.039 --> 1243.52
before i was ready to face the truth

1242.64 --> 1247.039
about

1243.52 --> 1247.76
what the world is like i did love them

1247.039 --> 1250.24
anyway

1247.76 --> 1252.4
like when i was a young kid i really

1250.24 --> 1256.64
fell in love with the moon landing

1252.4 --> 1261.44
and with the idea of it a lot

1256.64 --> 1263.919
and the old video footage and like props

1261.44 --> 1265.2
and drawings and i was always drawing

1263.919 --> 1268.3200000000002
things in space

1265.2 --> 1269.28
so it's just like yeah it was fake but i

1268.32 --> 1271.6789999999999
was just

1269.28 --> 1273.36
so in love with the idea and the fantasy

1271.679 --> 1275.44
of it all from a primitive

1273.36 --> 1277.1999999999998
young perspective that it just didn't

1275.44 --> 1278.96
care

1277.2 --> 1281.28
and it's only when people started to

1278.96 --> 1284.72
point out the details to me

1281.28 --> 1285.28
way before flat earth like this is fake

1284.72 --> 1287.52
this is

1285.28 --> 1289.36
that it just it just hurt it's just like

1287.52 --> 1291.84
ow don't do that

1289.36 --> 1292.799
like i don't i don't want to be

1291.84 --> 1298.9599999999998
confronted

1292.799 --> 1298.96
with it that was weird back then

1300.4 --> 1305.919
and then much later i started to realize

1303.28 --> 1308.24
still before flat earth like wow

1305.919 --> 1309.919
they did probably fool us because this

1308.24 --> 1312.0
can't really work now that i'm

1309.919 --> 1314.5590000000002
actually a little bit more adult and

1312.0 --> 1316.32
thinking about this

1314.559 --> 1317.6
but i still believe in space and all

1316.32 --> 1320.72
that

1317.6 --> 1324.7199999999998
like i just couldn't

1320.72 --> 1326.48
it filled up so much in my mind

1324.72 --> 1328.48
science fiction and all that and just

1326.48 --> 1332.08
like the universe is like that right

1328.48 --> 1334.08
you just start to assume it it has to be

1332.08 --> 1336.0
and i thought like okay well maybe we'll

1334.08 --> 1337.6
just have to take over now so just

1336.0 --> 1339.6
replace them and do it right

1337.6 --> 1341.36
actually do it the right way not just

1339.6 --> 1343.52
try to fool everybody

1341.36 --> 1345.1999999999998
and that's really when i started to get

1343.52 --> 1348.559
a lot of energy gathered

1345.2 --> 1350.72
to really try and go for it like i

1348.559 --> 1352.6399999999999
literally went to people

1350.72 --> 1354.24
i said like i want to build a space

1352.64 --> 1356.72
program that's real

1354.24 --> 1357.76
and then for one of the first times like

1356.72 --> 1360.799
somebody just said

1357.76 --> 1363.919
flat earth

1360.799 --> 1367.36
it was very shocking

1363.919 --> 1370.159
and then yeah that kind of snapped me

1367.36 --> 1371.84
out of it and then i really started

1370.159 --> 1373.5200000000002
reapproaching flat earth because i've

1371.84 --> 1376.0
been confronted with that before but it

1373.52 --> 1378.8799999999999
was kind of scary

1376.0 --> 1380.64
people yeah back then it was like a

1378.88 --> 1383.1200000000001
scary thing

1380.64 --> 1383.1200000000001
in a way

1384.88 --> 1388.24
and then yeah mark sergeant and i

1386.64 --> 1391.76
snapped out of it

1388.24 --> 1393.76
basically yeah my old friend

1391.76 --> 1397.039
circle or what was left of it because i

1393.76 --> 1400.24
was already kind of distant for a while

1397.039 --> 1403.76
because i am kind of a reclusive person

1400.24 --> 1405.76
mostly they they basically

1403.76 --> 1407.44
yeah that completely broke off because

1405.76 --> 1409.36
they it weirdly not they had seen it

1407.44 --> 1412.159
coming i had been kind of predicting

1409.36 --> 1412.1589999999999
what would happen

1413.6 --> 1417.6789999999999
that i would kind of snap out of it but

1415.76 --> 1420.1589999999999
i did not know

1417.679 --> 1422.4
what that meant yet from that

1420.159 --> 1423.279
perspective of not being snapped out of

1422.4 --> 1425.8400000000001
it

1423.279 --> 1427.679
and so when they finally saw that i was

1425.84 --> 1431.76
just going over that threshold and not

1427.679 --> 1435.2
coming back they decided to just

1431.76 --> 1437.039
reject me i think they were never going

1435.2 --> 1440.24
to accept that

1437.039 --> 1443.2
so yeah then i just broke

1440.24 --> 1443.6
with that entire friend situation that

1443.2 --> 1446.48
i've

1443.6 --> 1446.48
been part of for

1446.64 --> 1450.3200000000002
15 years or more

1453.279 --> 1456.96
but it was already kind of teetering

1454.96 --> 1458.08
there were so many bad habits and all

1456.96 --> 1462.64
that

1458.08 --> 1465.1999999999998
ingrained in it and like unrepenting

1462.64 --> 1466.72
that it was it was already breaking

1465.2 --> 1469.52
apart

1466.72 --> 1472.64
because i'm a purist i always have been

1469.52 --> 1475.52
and i've done things that

1472.64 --> 1477.6000000000001
well not horrific things i think but

1475.52 --> 1480.0
things that are still just wrong i

1477.6 --> 1481.1999999999998
i wanted to test it back then it went

1480.0 --> 1482.96
through the gothic scene

1481.2 --> 1485.039
right you could constantly get

1482.96 --> 1489.44
confronted and pushed to basically go

1485.039 --> 1491.76
over edges and

1489.44 --> 1492.72
thank god that i didn't go too far with

1491.76 --> 1497.2
that

1492.72 --> 1497.2
but yeah anyway

1499.52 --> 1504.1589999999999
you a traveling man no no not at all

1506.24 --> 1509.36
god are you still squirting over those

1508.08 --> 1515.84
numbers

1509.36 --> 1515.84
it's just numbers dude

1518.799 --> 1522.1589999999999
bit that i panicked because of the size

1520.48 --> 1524.64
so everybody panics

1522.159 --> 1526.8400000000001
when they first snap out of its extern

1524.64 --> 1529.8400000000001
don't worry about it it happens to

1526.84 --> 1529.84
everyone

1534.3 --> 1537.54
[Music]

1537.919 --> 1543.1200000000001
crow triple seven yeah

1541.2 --> 1546.64
well crow's also been around for a long

1543.12 --> 1549.76
time it was weird because

1546.64 --> 1551.279
another yeah i've had some look this is

1549.76 --> 1553.44
just me this is not generally about

1551.279 --> 1555.44
flatters but i've had some really weird

1553.44 --> 1556.0
experiences in my life that i generally

1555.44 --> 1559.8400000000001
refer to

1556.0 --> 1564.32
as dark world experiences vision things

1559.84 --> 1568.08
and i saw eric dube video in 2012

1564.32 --> 1571.4399999999998
which should be impossible because he

1568.08 --> 1574.72
didn't have a youtube channel back then

1571.44 --> 1574.72
right very odd

1574.88 --> 1582.5590000000002
and at the same time i also

1578.88 --> 1585.8400000000001
back then was

1582.559 --> 1588.96
saw there was a moon ripple video from

1585.84 --> 1588.9599999999998
crow triple seven

1590.32 --> 1594.08
but i did not i don't think i saw these

1593.36 --> 1596.3999999999999
things like

1594.08 --> 1598.0
on the computer with the internet back

1596.4 --> 1599.76
then i wasn't even digging for

1598.0 --> 1601.2
that i saw it through a dark world

1599.76 --> 1603.76
vision

1601.2 --> 1606.0
it's very weird and i've had more of

1603.76 --> 1606.0
these

1606.159 --> 1613.8400000000001
but yeah those two

1609.919 --> 1613.8400000000001
i remember that distinctly

1614.64 --> 1618.64
from way before it's like i was being

1616.88 --> 1619.679
warned about that or something now what

1618.64 --> 1621.8400000000001
does that mean

1619.679 --> 1627.8400000000001
is that an ominous warning or is it just

1621.84 --> 1627.84
a four look i don't know

1646.08 --> 1651.52
uh no mind of god you are not getting on

1649.039 --> 1651.52
my show

1652.64 --> 1656.159
don't try to bury look just because i

1655.039 --> 1658.64
haven't banned you

1656.159 --> 1660.64
yet doesn't mean that i want you on my

1658.64 --> 1662.96
show thank you very much you made some

1660.64 --> 1664.3990000000001
really disgusting videos including

1662.96 --> 1666.48
slandering me

1664.399 --> 1668.559
you might want to remove all of those

1666.48 --> 1670.3990000000001
before you before

1668.559 --> 1683.44
approaching me that you actually want a

1670.399 --> 1685.84
conversation okay what the donsky

1683.44 --> 1685.8400000000001
dude

1690.88 --> 1699.279
really that's that's crazy

1695.76 --> 1701.919
i i can't say that i

1699.279 --> 1703.52
have witnessed that specifically but i

1701.919 --> 1705.44
remember eric dubay

1703.52 --> 1706.72
and some others getting pretty nutty in

1705.44 --> 1708.96
the beginning but they were just

1706.72 --> 1710.0
attention grabbing that's how i saw it

1708.96 --> 1712.48
they were just like

1710.0 --> 1714.48
oh i'm illuminati special let's grab

1712.48 --> 1718.24
that attention

1714.48 --> 1721.3600000000001
it was also going on in media a lot

1718.24 --> 1724.159
if you remember so

1721.36 --> 1725.279
it does that mean he is this or that i

1724.159 --> 1727.919
don't know

1725.279 --> 1728.559
i don't think so now eric dubay from

1727.919 --> 1730.7990000000002
what i've seen

1728.559 --> 1732.32
is definitely not perfect there are some

1730.799 --> 1735.76
weird things

1732.32 --> 1737.039
but yeah some yeah a lot of his works

1735.76 --> 1739.55
are pretty good

1737.039 --> 1741.2
good enough

1739.55 --> 1745.52
[Music]

1741.2 --> 1745.52
oh you had to unsub okay well

1745.919 --> 1753.279
if you had to you had to you know

1749.12 --> 1754.8799999999999
i'm still subbed to people even though

1753.279 --> 1756.64
yeah i'm not a hundred percent sure

1754.88 --> 1756.96
about them because they still want to

1756.64 --> 1759.279
keep

1756.96 --> 1759.279
track

1762.399 --> 1769.6
he's the bible that will

1766.72 --> 1769.6000000000001
okie dokie

1770.559 --> 1773.9189999999999
look i'm not worried in that sense you

1773.279 --> 1778.159
know

1773.919 --> 1781.5200000000002
because i literally see god

1778.159 --> 1782.3200000000002
from the christ perspective the real god

1781.52 --> 1785.6
if you will

1782.32 --> 1786.72
i see him as he is almighty so i'm not

1785.6 --> 1788.399
really worried about

1786.72 --> 1790.88
anybody that thinks that there's this

1788.399 --> 1793.9189999999999
special boy in some way

1790.88 --> 1795.3600000000001
try to secretly occultly do these things

1793.919 --> 1799.039
if they're going to have a cult

1795.36 --> 1799.039
following which typically happens

1799.12 --> 1804.7199999999998
that's not strong

1802.399 --> 1808.8799999999999
it's just like a goblin army you know

1804.72 --> 1811.919
it's not

1808.88 --> 1812.3990000000001
i'm not worried i'm not worried about

1811.919 --> 1814.7990000000002
that

1812.399 --> 1814.799
at all

1818.799 --> 1821.84
so if he is that then he will just

1820.96 --> 1825.279
collapse

1821.84 --> 1826.24
eventually as yeah people that go for

1825.279 --> 1829.44
that sort of thing

1826.24 --> 1830.799
always do they will turn into complete

1829.44 --> 1833.3600000000001
squirters and

1830.799 --> 1835.279
just the worst things promoting the

1833.36 --> 1837.84
worst things and then eventually they

1835.279 --> 1841.12
just break apart

1837.84 --> 1842.399
that's what happens so i'm not worried

1841.12 --> 1845.039
about it the design

1842.399 --> 1851.84
has taken it into account and i'm aware

1845.039 --> 1851.84
of that

1854.72 --> 1859.44
you want to know more about the bible

1856.48 --> 1860.88
okay well there's a lot to say about it

1859.44 --> 1864.159
but

1860.88 --> 1867.519
if you want to inquire

1864.159 --> 1868.24
a source that i consider wise and a lot

1867.519 --> 1870.159
of people are

1868.24 --> 1872.72
instantly in the chat just going to

1870.159 --> 1875.7600000000002
escort themselves to death

1872.72 --> 1879.039
right which is a good sign because that

1875.76 --> 1882.48
means there's light so i recommend you

1879.039 --> 1882.48
check out bible literalist

1885.2 --> 1889.44
bible literature i took advice also from

1888.08 --> 1893.12
bible literalist

1889.44 --> 1896.0800000000002
for example on like what bible

1893.12 --> 1896.9599999999998
should i get what would be good for for

1896.08 --> 1900.8799999999999
a newbie

1896.96 --> 1904.72
that is on my level because she

1900.88 --> 1907.6000000000001
is like a fanatic

1904.72 --> 1908.24
when it comes to the details and being

1907.6 --> 1911.36
aware of

1908.24 --> 1913.6
just all the studies she's very studied

1911.36 --> 1915.12
with the bible she does not have some

1913.6 --> 1919.1999999999998
violence syndrome she has

1915.12 --> 1922.799
she's not perfect but she is very wise

1919.2 --> 1926.0800000000002
and has grown and learned a lot

1922.799 --> 1929.279
in in the last few years and i

1926.08 --> 1929.6
really recommend that if you want to get

1929.279 --> 1932.64
be

1929.6 --> 1935.12
serious with the bible and

1932.64 --> 1936.3990000000001
realize that it is basically an eternal

1935.12 --> 1938.32
growing path

1936.399 --> 1940.4799999999998
then i definitely recommend you check

1938.32 --> 1942.08
out bible literally i just put the link

1940.48 --> 1945.039
in chat

1942.08 --> 1949.84
subscribe to her and check out some of

1945.039 --> 1949.84
her videos

1950.0 --> 1953.519
that doesn't mean oh you have to do

1951.919 --> 1955.1200000000001
everything she say or

1953.519 --> 1957.84
figure out that she's right about

1955.12 --> 1960.0
everything it's just a really

1957.84 --> 1961.039
good person to be around because she has

1960.0 --> 1965.76
a lot of

1961.039 --> 1968.32
detailed well thought out things

1965.76 --> 1970.08
she researched concerning the bible and

1968.32 --> 1971.6789999999999
things that are said about the bible

1970.08 --> 1973.279
it's just very interesting and i

1971.679 --> 1979.3600000000001
recommend you follow him

1973.279 --> 1979.36
her uh all right sex sterling

1979.76 --> 1991.84
33 what are you talking about

1996.32 --> 2005.84
all right

2009.279 --> 2013.43
right

2010.37 --> 2013.4299999999998
[Music]

2014.24 --> 2019.279
just one thing you should realize is

2015.919 --> 2023.519
external link concerning the bible is

2019.279 --> 2026.559
christianity and people

2023.519 --> 2027.76
have a lot of problems so there is many

2026.559 --> 2031.039
ways also to get

2027.76 --> 2032.0
lost in the bible basically how i define

2031.039 --> 2037.12
it get stuck on

2032.0 --> 2040.48
exotarix and lose this this spirit of it

2037.12 --> 2041.36
which to me is what the bible really is

2040.48 --> 2044.96
all about

2041.36 --> 2044.9599999999998
it's about jesus christ

2045.6 --> 2048.799
what he stands for

2049.599 --> 2055.9190000000003
the lessons he had to teach

2052.72 --> 2057.04
about the nature of reality and what's

2055.919 --> 2059.04
the best way

2057.04 --> 2060.48
to do things according to the design

2059.04 --> 2064.079
like how were we

2060.48 --> 2067.359
meant to become almost right

2064.079 --> 2069.599
that is what i take from it

2067.359 --> 2070.72
and the bible itself is a very complex

2069.599 --> 2073.599
book

2070.72 --> 2075.2799999999997
you with it's a multi-dimensional book

2073.599 --> 2076.7200000000003
it's incredible and you can find

2075.28 --> 2080.159
whatever you're looking for

2076.72 --> 2082.9599999999996
whether it is good or bad right

2080.159 --> 2084.0
and so a lot of people also dig into the

2082.96 --> 2087.919
bible and then

2084.0 --> 2088.24
just get weird things out of it and then

2087.919 --> 2090.48
they

2088.24 --> 2092.6389999999997
hang on to those things and make it

2090.48 --> 2094.399
their

2092.639 --> 2095.839
thing they do with the bible a lot of

2094.399 --> 2097.92
people out there do that

2095.839 --> 2099.839
and it's not always good because a lot

2097.92 --> 2104.64
of these people ignore

2099.839 --> 2107.359
key factors in what is very important

2104.64 --> 2107.839
about the spirit of christ the spirit

2107.359 --> 2117.839
what

2107.839 --> 2117.839
yeah the spirit of the esoterics

2127.92 --> 2131.839
what the [ __ ]

2138.56 --> 2141.7599999999998
help yourself my helping others that's

2140.32 --> 2145.3590000000004
one way to say it

2141.76 --> 2147.92
or you could just say help

2145.359 --> 2149.7599999999998
and when you help others you also help

2147.92 --> 2154.16
yourself

2149.76 --> 2157.2000000000003
and when you help yourself

2154.16 --> 2160.3199999999997
you also help others if

2157.2 --> 2160.3199999999997
if you intend to

2160.64 --> 2166.72
it's just help that's how i would say

2164.32 --> 2168.4
like because what you do what your

2166.72 --> 2171.68
methods

2168.4 --> 2172.079
will accompany the frequency like a

2171.68 --> 2174.72
certain

2172.079 --> 2175.28
type of energy that comes with those

2174.72 --> 2178.48
methods

2175.28 --> 2181.92
and those shape you

2178.48 --> 2187.359
those determine what you will want

2181.92 --> 2190.64
what starts to drive you

2187.359 --> 2193.2
and that's where christ's teachings

2190.64 --> 2193.2
comes in

2198.839 --> 2201.839
right

2204.64 --> 2209.5989999999997
are you addressing mind of god people in

2206.72 --> 2212.7999999999997
chat if you are going to address

2209.599 --> 2216.4
somebody else in chat please

2212.8 --> 2218.1600000000003
add their name in the sentence so i know

2216.4 --> 2220.64
you are addressing them otherwise

2218.16 --> 2222.56
there's going to be confusion

2220.64 --> 2223.68
and that confusion might at some point

2222.56 --> 2227.119
piss me off

2223.68 --> 2229.839
to no degree yeah or

2227.119 --> 2229.839
to no end so

2230.32 --> 2233.28
be careful with that

2235.04 --> 2241.119
right but yeah the deception that

2239.2 --> 2243.7599999999998
mine of god is talking about i don't

2241.119 --> 2246.079
call it that i call it the challenge

2243.76 --> 2246.88
it's the challenge of reality it's a

2246.079 --> 2251.04
challenge for

2246.88 --> 2253.599
our intellect when we awaken

2251.04 --> 2255.04
there's many challenges on every level

2253.599 --> 2257.6800000000003
because just oh you think

2255.04 --> 2258.72
flat earth is the ultimate thing really

2257.68 --> 2261.52
no it's

2258.72 --> 2263.52
it's the middle of the hourglass it's

2261.52 --> 2264.72
the middle it's the crossroads it's

2263.52 --> 2266.8
where

2264.72 --> 2268.0789999999997
it switches it's not the end by a long

2266.8 --> 2270.6400000000003
shot

2268.079 --> 2272.4
because that's only the beginning and

2270.64 --> 2275.2
i've been trying to

2272.4 --> 2276.64
deal with the complications that come

2275.2 --> 2278.96
after that point

2276.64 --> 2284.0789999999997
and physicality assumption bias is a big

2278.96 --> 2287.2
part of it

2284.079 --> 2291.92
and yeah the reification of

2287.2 --> 2291.9199999999996
literal models within the flat earth

2294.56 --> 2299.839
hey robin sandy

2303.68 --> 2308.0
okay mind of god i'm glad you enjoyed

2310.839 --> 2313.839
that

2324.839 --> 2327.839
ah

2329.92 --> 2338.16
on politics do votes count well

2334.16 --> 2341.2799999999997
not really but it is kind of

2338.16 --> 2345.5989999999997
like the voting system the apparent

2341.28 --> 2345.599
democracy it is kind of an important

2346.0 --> 2351.52
scam to continue to prevent

2349.68 --> 2353.68
people from getting restless because

2351.52 --> 2356.4
there needs to be an apparent

2353.68 --> 2357.7599999999998
freedom as it were because if it is

2356.4 --> 2359.6800000000003
overtly taken

2357.76 --> 2362.5600000000004
then people will become restless and

2359.68 --> 2362.56
less productive

2364.88 --> 2370.079
i think that was probably this type of

2366.88 --> 2370.079
answer you were looking for

2370.4 --> 2378.88
darwin is likely a trump supporter

2373.68 --> 2378.8799999999997
what not really

2380.079 --> 2387.52
but i yeah i am a fan

2384.24 --> 2389.9199999999996
and in in that i do echo a lot of owen

2387.52 --> 2392.24
benjamin sentiments

2389.92 --> 2395.2000000000003
because i think he is funny and he is

2392.24 --> 2397.5989999999997
very creative

2395.2 --> 2398.72
but he's absolutely not perfect and he

2397.599 --> 2401.839
is

2398.72 --> 2404.64
convoluted as can be

2401.839 --> 2408.0
but that's just what he is he's a

2404.64 --> 2411.52
businessman he's a networker and

2408.0 --> 2415.44
yeah with it comes certain principles

2411.52 --> 2416.64
and methods that are far from perfect

2415.44 --> 2419.839
but they serve

2416.64 --> 2425.839
the function of what he does

2419.839 --> 2425.839
and how he does it

2434.16 --> 2441.1189999999997
no that's not what i said mind of god

2437.839 --> 2444.24
owen benjamin talks about trump and i

2441.119 --> 2444.2400000000002
resonate with that

2444.48 --> 2448.8
trump is the businessman this is

2447.04 --> 2453.839
ridiculous

2448.8 --> 2453.8390000000004
come on

2469.839 --> 2473.7599999999998
jesus said he was not god i don't know

2478.079 --> 2481.76
you see the thing is whatever's gonna be

2480.24 --> 2483.7599999999998
said i don't

2481.76 --> 2485.28
really care in the end because i'm an

2483.76 --> 2488.48
asset terrorist

2485.28 --> 2490.1600000000003
i simply realize through my own

2488.48 --> 2493.119
ascension that

2490.16 --> 2494.16
what the importance is of christ of what

2493.119 --> 2498.6400000000003
is written about him of

2494.16 --> 2502.319
his lessons and then all the other

2498.64 --> 2505.5989999999997
stuff concerning who jesus christ is

2502.319 --> 2506.64
doesn't really matter anymore he himself

2505.599 --> 2509.839
said

2506.64 --> 2513.7599999999998
you can you

2509.839 --> 2517.2
should and you can also do what i am

2513.76 --> 2519.599
like that it's like

2517.2 --> 2519.5989999999997
hello

2520.88 --> 2526.2400000000002
all these esoteric details

2524.079 --> 2527.119
it's like whether it is legitimate or

2526.24 --> 2531.5989999999997
not

2527.119 --> 2536.1600000000003
it's not relevant to me

2531.599 --> 2540.319
because i just see it for what it is in

2536.16 --> 2540.319
an esoteric sense and that is what i

2548.839 --> 2551.839
follow

2562.839 --> 2565.839
so

2566.16 --> 2579.839
who cares

2580.24 --> 2586.6299999999997
where do i stand on freemasonry oh why

2583.04 --> 2589.52
don't you ask a simple question

2586.63 --> 2593.839
[Music]

2589.52 --> 2593.839
i don't know i'm really neutral

2594.24 --> 2601.52
i don't see freemasonry as a

2597.52 --> 2604.72
big threat but they do contribute

2601.52 --> 2609.119
to both good and bad things

2604.72 --> 2609.1189999999997
they are also part of conditioning

2610.48 --> 2612.96
they are

2613.52 --> 2618.96
not yeah they are occult a lot of it

2616.88 --> 2619.92
but yeah again at the top like with

2618.96 --> 2622.8
every freaking

2619.92 --> 2623.599
organization and religion out there it

2622.8 --> 2626.319
all

2623.599 --> 2628.56
gets completely grappled and dark and

2626.319 --> 2628.56
[ __ ]

2628.8 --> 2635.8390000000004
yeah freemasonry is not particularly

2630.96 --> 2635.839
unique at that

2647.92 --> 2652.64
yeah i know it's very cute evils of

2650.72 --> 2655.9199999999996
masons and evil of that

2652.64 --> 2656.7999999999997
but you see i'm trying to figure out how

2655.92 --> 2662.4
to do good

2656.8 --> 2664.88
instead of obsessing over evil because

2662.4 --> 2665.92
i want to not turn into a complete

2664.88 --> 2669.2000000000003
savage

2665.92 --> 2673.28
because it doesn't lead anywhere

2669.2 --> 2673.2799999999997
just makes you squirt all day over the

2674.839 --> 2680.24
darkness

2676.4 --> 2680.2400000000002
do i speak to rv truth no

2687.04 --> 2691.839
i think i might have seen a couple of

2688.4 --> 2691.839
videos of him at at some point

2699.76 --> 2708.96
hey yo yo heaven good to see you

2704.8 --> 2710.96
do i like his content well probably not

2708.96 --> 2713.68
because otherwise i would just i would

2710.96 --> 2716.0
still be subscribed

2713.68 --> 2717.2
but maybe it's good it's just that at

2716.0 --> 2719.359
some point

2717.2 --> 2722.56
there is just a lot of the same type of

2719.359 --> 2722.56
stuff that people make

2727.119 --> 2733.839
but i don't know this is all just

2729.839 --> 2733.839
preliminary sizing up

2738.0 --> 2743.599
because rv truth it yeah it rings a bell

2741.44 --> 2745.52
vaguely but

2743.599 --> 2747.839
i might be mistaking it for somebody

2745.52 --> 2751.599
else that is very similar like rt

2747.839 --> 2753.2799999999997
truth or vr truth or whatever

2751.599 --> 2754.96
because yeah there's a lot of youtube

2753.28 --> 2756.8
channels that typically do

2754.96 --> 2759.119
those sorts of videos there's like

2756.8 --> 2759.76
hundreds of thousands of them out there

2759.119 --> 2762.7200000000003
now

2759.76 --> 2763.599
and they are very similar you never got

2762.72 --> 2768.7999999999997
that link yes

2763.599 --> 2772.8
i gave from bible literally yes i did

2768.8 --> 2772.8

3160.319 --> 3162.96
complete

3164.839 --> 3167.839
self-destruction

3171.2 --> 3175.839
you can't even link to other youtube

3174.0 --> 3179.2
channels or videos

3185.76 --> 3192.2400000000002
who is in control of this

3189.04 --> 3194.96

him

3195.359 --> 3209.839

3218.48 --> 3224.319
own platform like

3219.68 --> 3224.319
why is this acceptable to anyone

3231.68 --> 3236.7999999999997

3234.079 --> 3238.96
hand it over to governments

3236.8 --> 3240.96
is that's what what they're doing

3238.96 --> 3242.559
they're just pushing it so bad they're

3240.96 --> 3245.68
just derailing everything like

3242.559 --> 3248.88
until they literally just start

3245.68 --> 3251.52
just putting noises and visual

3248.88 --> 3252.079
[ __ ] over videos just ruining it on

3251.52 --> 3253.7599999999998
purpose

3252.079 --> 3255.599
until people just demand their

3253.76 --> 3258.3190000000004
governments nationalize it is that's

3255.599 --> 3258.319
what's going on

3260.8 --> 3267.119
this is insane the people that are doing

3264.0 --> 3270.72
this should be taken

3267.119 --> 3273.839
care of quickly

3270.72 --> 3279.839
they're destroying things everything is

3273.839 --> 3279.839

3354.0 --> 3358.0

3355.119 --> 3363.839
downgrading the internet is a good thing

hmm

3594.0 --> 3598.24
hey that's your that's your mind you

3596.079 --> 3600.48
know if you per default think that

3598.24 --> 3602.64
people are drinking piss then maybe

3600.48 --> 3604.64
you should consider that you have a bit

3602.64 --> 3608.72
of a problem

3604.64 --> 3610.5589999999997
right because people don't do that

3608.72 --> 3612.48
if you're thinking that constantly

3610.559 --> 3613.8390000000004
there's something really weird going on

3612.48 --> 3628.64
in your head

3613.839 --> 3630.5589999999997
just saying

3628.64 --> 3632.72
yeah laugh it up you're the one saying

3630.559 --> 3632.7200000000003
it

[Music]

3640.0 --> 3644.24
oh no [ __ ] juice i haven't really

3643.2 --> 3648.319
addressed the

3644.24 --> 3648.319
the alignment i know it's here today

3649.44 --> 3653.28
so yeah ooh certain crossroads in the

3652.16 --> 3656.64
celestial

3653.28 --> 3659.599
dynamics it's cute has also been said oh

3656.64 --> 3662.72
this is the actual

3659.599 --> 3665.92
uh what is it again the

3662.72 --> 3669.04
what two that was associated with 2012

3665.92 --> 3670.0
the mayan calendar reset right and

3669.04 --> 3672.24
they're calling it the great

3670.0 --> 3675.92
reset so maybe that is really it maybe

3672.24 --> 3679.1189999999997
it's just the calendar reset

3675.92 --> 3679.599
that was originally said to be in 2012

3679.119 --> 3681.839
but

3679.599 --> 3683.76
some people have worked out that through

3681.839 --> 3686.319
gregorian calendar

3683.76 --> 3687.119
that it should actually be now but who

3686.319 --> 3689.599
knows man

3687.119 --> 3690.799
some i think sometimes people say this

3689.599 --> 3695.52
every year

3690.799 --> 3699.839
so i'm not sure it's not a crossbow

3695.52 --> 3699.839
[ __ ] sake

3701.68 --> 3715.68
god damn it

3712.559 --> 3716.559
right well maybe you should drink a lot

3715.68 --> 3719.5989999999997
less

3716.559 --> 3719.599

3756.319 --> 3758.72
minutes

3762.16 --> 3766.0789999999997
yeah my show is not a drinking show if

3829.44 --> 3832.88
and i don't want to i don't want it

3831.76 --> 3836.079
again

3832.88 --> 3839.44
i'm trying out something else

3836.079 --> 3840.079
but yeah the thing i miss most about not

3839.44 --> 3842.88
drinking

3840.079 --> 3843.92
about drinking weirdly enough is that it

3842.88 --> 3847.6800000000003
would kind of put

3843.92 --> 3850.48
my metabolism through like sort of a

3847.68 --> 3851.0389999999998
daily slight punishment it sounds weird

3850.48 --> 3852.96
right

3851.039 --> 3855.5200000000004
but what it did is basically make me

3852.96 --> 3858.16
less hungry it's very odd

3855.52 --> 3859.0389999999998
but it also had other side influences it

3858.16 --> 3862.3999999999996
would kind of

3859.039 --> 3866.0
downgrade my energy activity

3862.4 --> 3870.4
making me i guess need less food

3866.0 --> 3871.68
but also yeah make me less sharp

3870.4 --> 3874.4
and that's the thing i don't want to

3871.68 --> 3874.3999999999996
lose right now

3874.64 --> 3881.68
and i know i will lose it

3878.079 --> 3884.799
when i start drinking again

3881.68 --> 3886.24
even if just a little so i'm just

3884.799 --> 3895.839
keeping it the way it is and i'm

3886.24 --> 3895.839
perfectly fine with that

3906.72 --> 3909.839
t is proper

3916.64 --> 3918.96
move

3937.2 --> 3954.0
goody swamp troll just woke up

3950.4 --> 3957.6800000000003
hmm kratom

3954.0 --> 3961.52
heard of that i've never tried it i just

3957.68 --> 3963.44
well the first priority was to basically

3961.52 --> 3967.0389999999998
downgrade my drinking

3963.44 --> 3967.599
to get it to like instead of just

3967.039 --> 3970.7990000000004
wanting

3967.599 --> 3973.839
prolonged periods to be in the in the

3970.799 --> 3975.2
drinking state to just have a moment in

3973.839 --> 3979.52
the day

3975.2 --> 3982.799
and then say like okay for one two

3979.52 --> 3983.119
one two hours maybe three i will be like

3982.799 --> 3985.44
that

3983.119 --> 3986.6400000000003
and then spend my time what i typically

3985.44 --> 3989.28
wanna do

3986.64 --> 3989.2799999999997
in that state

3990.0 --> 3993.839
and i've been doing that for years now

3992.88 --> 3996.4
and really

3993.839 --> 3999.119
trying to never go over the limit that i

3996.4 --> 4002.64
set for myself which would be a liter

3999.119 --> 4004.7200000000003
of beer but yeah

4002.64 --> 4006.72
when i did go over that line at some

4004.72 --> 4007.4399999999996
point yeah it totally crashed on me and

4006.72 --> 4010.72
i got sick

4007.44 --> 4013.76
really sick for a week because it yeah

4010.72 --> 4018.0789999999997
probably triggered some other things

4013.76 --> 4020.4
and now that i'm out of it i just

4018.079 --> 4022.319
i kind of wanted to stop for a while

4020.4 --> 4022.64
because i felt like this is holding me

4022.319 --> 4025.119
down

4022.64 --> 4027.2
i don't like it now then i became sick

4025.119 --> 4030.2400000000002
and i completely cleared up

4027.2 --> 4033.4399999999996
very vividly it's like the sickness

4030.24 --> 4035.5989999999997
like was accompanied by like this

4033.44 --> 4037.52
transformation process like a clean up

4035.599 --> 4038.799
process because i didn't eat for a week

4037.52 --> 4042.24
very bizarre

4038.799 --> 4045.359
also didn't smoke for a week nothing

4042.24 --> 4046.319
barely ate barely drank like the first

4045.359 --> 4048.96
half

4046.319 --> 4049.839
but that cleared me up so much that it's

4048.96 --> 4051.52
just like wow

4049.839 --> 4053.52
i've suddenly got all these senses and

4051.52 --> 4056.48
all this rage back

4053.52 --> 4056.799
i'm not gonna drink i like this i want i

4056.48 --> 4060.64
i

4056.799 --> 4062.96
adapted my at my public attitude

4060.64 --> 4064.799
to that transformation partially just

4062.96 --> 4067.2
saying like okay

4064.799 --> 4069.599
i've tried to be tolerant no more no

4067.2 --> 4072.319
more tolerance

4069.599 --> 4073.44
like if i'm tolerant i i do it almost

4072.319 --> 4076.4
out of weakness

4073.44 --> 4077.2000000000003
now i switched it around the way to look

4076.4 --> 4079.039
at it

4077.2 --> 4080.64
i don't think tolerance is a virtue

4079.039 --> 4083.119
anymore

4080.64 --> 4086.4
it's sometimes a necessity i don't i

4083.119 --> 4088.559
think intolerance is actually a virtue

4086.4 --> 4090.96
so that's a big thing that happened as a

4088.559 --> 4096.319
consequences and yeah

4090.96 --> 4105.839
not drinking alcohol it it helps that

4096.319 --> 4105.839000000001
it does

4106.96 --> 4112.64
yeah yeah safe to say i don't squirt my

4111.6 --> 4114.88
hands with that

4112.64 --> 4116.96
alcohol garbage either i think it's

4114.88 --> 4117.6
utterly disgusting seeing people doing

4116.96 --> 4120.4800000000005
that

4117.6 --> 4122.400000000001
constantly it's just like oh my god do

4120.48 --> 4123.5199999999995
they do it every single time i can't

4122.4 --> 4126.639999999999
believe it

4123.52 --> 4133.839000000001
can't believe how terrible that is

4126.64 --> 4133.839
for their health it's really bad

4133.97 --> 4137.029
[Music]

4137.52 --> 4141.040000000001
and how do i know this well

4142.159 --> 4147.599999999999
back in the day via via there were

4145.44 --> 4149.199
plenty of people that i sort of knew or

4147.6 --> 4151.279
that i indirectly knew

4149.199 --> 4153.599999999999
that were constantly doing that they

4151.279 --> 4156.400000000001
were germaphobes and they would

4153.6 --> 4158.88
have alcohol thingies in their house and

4156.4 --> 4160.96
they would constantly do that

4158.88 --> 4163.279
well those people had really shitty

4160.96 --> 4163.279
health

4163.759 --> 4167.359
like it grew worse over time and just

4165.679 --> 4168.88
like oh why would that be

4167.359 --> 4174.4800000000005
is it because they're constantly

4168.88 --> 4176.719
exposing their microbiome to attacks

4174.48 --> 4178.639999999999
so they yeah can't build a proper

4176.719 --> 4179.359
defense against what's actually out

4178.64 --> 4181.759
there

4179.359 --> 4183.1990000000005
which is what you need your bacteria and

4181.759 --> 4186.48
all that for

4183.199 --> 4188.48
your biome and

4186.48 --> 4190.4
so i learned like that's not good for

4188.48 --> 4190.959999999999
you at all that's like one of the early

4190.4 --> 4192.799
stage

4190.96 --> 4195.28
things i learned when i started to eat

4192.799 --> 4202.64
organic i figured that one out

4195.28 --> 4204.48
and i had other people as examples

4202.64 --> 4208.4800000000005
and now everybody's doing this [ __ ] it's

4204.48 --> 4208.48
terrible it's not good for anything

4213.28 --> 4216.7
yeah the anxiety doesn't help either

4215.84 --> 4218.159000000001
absolutely

4216.7 --> 4220.96
[Music]

4218.159 --> 4220.96
it compounds

4223.199 --> 4227.839999999999
right hey go to work

4226.239 --> 4230.718999999999
oh it's really early for you so you're

4227.84 --> 4234.0
in the united states

4230.719 --> 4234.0
on the east coast

4236.48 --> 4245.839999999999
right anyway yeah have a good day hope

4239.28 --> 4245.84
to see you again

4249.44 --> 4259.839999999999
oh gosh look at this dittori making hand

4251.92 --> 4259.84
sanitizers goody

4261.94 --> 4266.0
[Music]

4270.84 --> 4273.84
so

4286.56 --> 4290.320000000001
around for medicinal purposes

4292.32 --> 4305.599999999999
i i don't know

4301.12 --> 4305.599999999999
i'd rather have colloidal silver around

4312.239 --> 4318.959999999999
look alco as a cleaning agent yes

4315.84 --> 4322.159000000001
it dissolves fats and oils and all that

4318.96 --> 4323.52
that's what it's kind of good for but

4322.159 --> 4326.839999999999
when it comes to like things like

4323.52 --> 4329.84
disinfectants no no no no i don't do

4326.84 --> 4329.84
that

4334.64 --> 4343.84
i'd rather have some colloidal silver

4345.44 --> 4350.159
you should try making colloidal silver

4348.08 --> 4353.28
why have

4350.159 --> 4353.759999999999
me and my ex used to do that like we

4353.28 --> 4357.84
bought

4353.76 --> 4361.4400000000005
or she for she bought this kit

4357.84 --> 4364.400000000001
at the time for sale via alex jones

4361.44 --> 4364.879999999999
situation that was still following back

4364.4 --> 4369.28
then

4364.88 --> 4373.6
very strongly it's like 2011.

4369.28 --> 4375.199
and yeah we made some of that

4373.6 --> 4376.88
a lot of it actually it was very

4375.199 --> 4379.36
interesting was a good system

4376.88 --> 4380.719
like this micro laboratory with

4379.36 --> 4385.12
electrolyze

4380.719 --> 4385.92
or yeah electrics and like this magnetic

4385.12 --> 4389.36
stirring

4385.92 --> 4391.4400000000005
pill was interesting and yeah

4389.36 --> 4393.599999999999
we made quite a lot of colloidal silver

4391.44 --> 4395.678999999999
and like even handed it out to people

4393.6 --> 4397.4400000000005
because we were like alternative health

4395.679 --> 4400.64
promoting it

4397.44 --> 4401.28
not officially but just like just giving

4400.64 --> 4412.2390000000005
it away

4401.28 --> 4416.159
because it was so dirt cheap to make

4412.239 --> 4416.159
but unfortunately i did not

4416.88 --> 4420.400000000001
she still has it i don't

4423.84 --> 4427.84
at the time it was quite an investment

4446.88 --> 4450.56
what really robin stanley

4452.84 --> 4455.84
that's

4462.88 --> 4469.84
that's a little weird

4485.84 --> 4491.4400000000005
huh what

4488.96 --> 4491.44
you mean

4492.08 --> 4498.08
dihydrogen oxide

4495.6 --> 4498.96
like from water vapor or i mean from

4498.08 --> 4501.44
water

4498.96 --> 4503.84
implodes not expo no no no no it does

4501.44 --> 4506.4
neither it detonates

4503.84 --> 4507.12
george sanford it doesn't implode or

4506.4 --> 4509.92
explode it

4507.12 --> 4511.12
detonates and then from the pressure

4509.92 --> 4514.0
wave

4511.12 --> 4518.08
of the detonation there is an implosion

4514.0 --> 4518.08
as a side effect it often happens with

4522.84 --> 4525.84
detonations

4546.48 --> 4556.4
torch sets okay

4552.32 --> 4558.639999999999
but no look if the gas is pre-mixed

4556.4 --> 4561.04
you can't use it like that that's

4558.64 --> 4563.52
impossible

4561.04 --> 4564.96
now what might be transpiring is that

4563.52 --> 4568.2390000000005
they're separated

4564.96 --> 4569.76
and then combined like literally an

4568.239 --> 4572.159
oxygen stream

4569.76 --> 4574.159000000001
opposing a hydrogen stream and that

4572.159 --> 4575.839999999999
together is ignited and then you get

4574.159 --> 4578.32
like a torch flame

4575.84 --> 4580.56
if you mix it up it's literally going to

4578.32 --> 4581.599999999999
detonate into the entire tanker and have

4580.56 --> 4585.360000000001
a giant

4581.6 --> 4589.280000000001
fragmentation explosion so no

4585.36 --> 4589.28
the gases are not mixed

4589.6 --> 4595.84
together in a tank that's absolute

4592.84 --> 4595.84
insanity

4602.8 --> 4606.88
now then it's not then you're wrong it's

4605.52 --> 4610.64
not hydrogen then

4606.88 --> 4613.28
it might be something else butane

4610.64 --> 4613.280000000001
or something

4614.08 --> 4619.76
there is no tank okay so then it is

4616.96 --> 4624.2390000000005
generated on the spot

4619.76 --> 4624.2390000000005
from water right

4624.8 --> 4628.64
right because if there is a buildup of

4626.88 --> 4633.28
both gases in a tanker

4628.64 --> 4636.64
that's like an extreme explosion hazard

4633.28 --> 4639.36
so if yeah i already said if it's

4636.64 --> 4651.84
if there's no build up then yeah that

4639.36 --> 4651.839999999999
can work

4659.199 --> 4666.08
wow pretty cool

4663.12 --> 4668.32
yeah i've i think that that same system

4666.08 --> 4672.08
should also be used

4668.32 --> 4675.84
in hydrogen engines

4672.08 --> 4676.8
and like not have tankers filled with

4675.84 --> 4679.12
hydrogen

4676.8 --> 4680.64
to then use as a fuel but to literally

4679.12 --> 4683.12
just have water

4680.64 --> 4684.56
then generate it on the spot don't let

4683.12 --> 4687.679
it build up and just

4684.56 --> 4690.8
inject it directly into the engine

4687.679 --> 4692.64
freshly made with this

4690.8 --> 4694.8
with the system and i've seen people

4692.64 --> 4695.76
that have built their cars like that in

4694.8 --> 4698.64
the past

4695.76 --> 4699.360000000001
on videos i think that's the best way to

4698.64 --> 4707.84
do it

4699.36 --> 4707.839999999999
it's very safe

4708.159 --> 4711.5199999999995
but there's already hydrogen engines out

4710.8 --> 4713.92
there

4711.52 --> 4715.040000000001
engines specifically designed to run on

4713.92 --> 4718.4
hydrogen

4715.04 --> 4721.199
those should be perfect you just need a

4718.4 --> 4722.0
a system to build to generate that

4721.199 --> 4725.44
hydrogen

4722.0 --> 4727.92
and oxygen from water on the spot

4725.44 --> 4729.678999999999
and quick enough and efficient enough so

4727.92 --> 4730.8
that doesn't cost a huge amount of

4729.679 --> 4732.2390000000005
electricity

4730.8 --> 4735.84
and then you can just have a

4732.239 --> 4735.839999999999
self-running system

4736.8 --> 4739.84
like a dynamo system on the running

4738.88 --> 4742.96
engine to

4739.84 --> 4745.679
provide the electricity to

4742.96 --> 4746.719
keep the the bubbler or whatever you're

4745.679 --> 4750.159
gonna call it

4746.719 --> 4752.159
going on high capacity and then

4750.159 --> 4755.36
yeah inject the fuel on the spot and all

4752.159 --> 4763.839999999999
you have to have basically is

4755.36 --> 4763.839999999999
just a water tank big enough

4769.84 --> 4773.76
right and basically all you need to do

4772.64 --> 4776.56
in an emergency

4773.76 --> 4778.4800000000005
is just cut off the electricity when you

4776.56 --> 4780.8
do that there is no more danger

4778.48 --> 4780.799999999999
at all

4784.719 --> 4789.84
because without the electricity there's

4786.48 --> 4793.3099999999995
no hydrogen going to build

4789.84 --> 4796.499
right it should be extremely safe

platinum plates platine platinum

4802.0 --> 4805.6
right but i know what you mean there's

4804.32 --> 4809.5199999999995
other ways though

4805.6 --> 4812.320000000001
[ __ ] juice it's i've

4809.52 --> 4815.040000000001
fia known some people not really no no

4812.32 --> 4817.04
i've never even met them in person but

4815.04 --> 4818.08
i was acquainted with people that are

4817.04 --> 4821.5199999999995
very much into

4818.08 --> 4825.12
that and a guy had

4821.52 --> 4828.719
in on an industrial level perfected

4825.12 --> 4830.8
hydrogen generators so that it like

4828.719 --> 4832.8
instead of using platinum and all that

4830.8 --> 4833.76
which would make such a device extremely

4832.8 --> 4836.88
expensive

4833.76 --> 4838.639
he managed to like cut it down by a

4836.88 --> 4842.0
hundred percent

4838.639 --> 4843.36
or like 99 of the cost he found another

4842.0 --> 4846.08
way to do it without

4843.36 --> 4847.839999999999
expensive materials i don't know the

4846.08 --> 4851.12
details because it's an industrial

4847.84 --> 4853.679
secret now he sold it apparently

4851.12 --> 4857.44
which means that it might be completely

4853.679 --> 4857.4400000000005
out of the loop now because of that

4859.28 --> 4866.0
but you don't need the expensive

4862.719 --> 4866.0
materials necessarily

4869.52 --> 4872.96
so it can be just very cheap on all

4872.4 --> 4875.04
fronts

4872.96 --> 4877.84
on all fronts it can be so cheap and

4875.04 --> 4882.0
effective that people could

4877.84 --> 4884.4800000000005
a little study up and a good garage

4882.0 --> 4885.76
and tool set could even make one

4884.48 --> 4888.638999999999
themselves

4885.76 --> 4890.719
eventually just make it yourself just

4888.639 --> 4892.719
like you might make engine parts or

4890.719 --> 4895.12
something for a car

4892.719 --> 4895.76
to try and fix it up or something right

4895.12 --> 4898.08
it could

4895.76 --> 4900.719
go to that level of technology that

4898.08 --> 4903.04
could be that easy

4900.719 --> 4905.199
if yeah it's not all going to be routed

4903.04 --> 4905.199
out

4906.32 --> 4909.5199999999995
by the industrialists

4909.92 --> 4913.6
stainless steel steel it's very

4912.88 --> 4917.84
expensive

4913.6 --> 4917.84
no it's not

carbon fiber tubing interesting

4942.08 --> 4948.159
right no rust there

4945.92 --> 4949.76
well there's always going to be problems

4948.159 --> 4950.96
though because when you're splitting up

4949.76 --> 4953.4400000000005
water

4950.96 --> 4955.36
especially if it's not perfectly

4953.44 --> 4958.799999999999
distilled water

4955.36 --> 4961.839999999999
there's going to be reactions

4958.8 --> 4961.84
with whatever's there

4962.639 --> 4966.2390000000005
you would always have to every now and

4964.88 --> 4973.52
then clean up

4966.239 --> 4976.638999999999
the bubbler clean it out or replace it

4973.52 --> 4977.679
it's going to be a more dirty part of

4976.639 --> 4980.08
the system

4977.679 --> 4982.159
of yeah because it will eventually

4980.08 --> 4987.84
always start to just

4982.159 --> 4987.839999999999
have sediment or whatever deterioration

4998.84 --> 5001.84
hey

5007.76 --> 5015.84
all right

5026.84 --> 5029.84
hmm

5030.88 --> 5044.96
okay interesting iron fe i

5042.239 --> 5045.919999999999
i've never been much of an engine or

5044.96 --> 5048.159
even a car

5045.92 --> 5049.52
tinkerer guy but it was always

5048.159 --> 5051.839999999999
interesting

5049.52 --> 5053.84
to kind of remotely learn how it sort of

5051.84 --> 5055.679
worked so i would be the guy that would

5053.84 --> 5058.88
always go to a garage

5055.679 --> 5061.76
and there was a problem but then

5058.88 --> 5062.96
i wanted to be there as they figured i

5061.76 --> 5064.96
was wrong

5062.96 --> 5066.4800000000005
so i was basically like looking like oh

5064.96 --> 5070.88
what is he doing

5066.48 --> 5072.718999999999
what is he checking but

5070.88 --> 5074.32
because i want to be able to basically

5072.719 --> 5076.32
if something is wrong at least

5074.32 --> 5078.239
quickly be able to figure out what is

5076.32 --> 5078.5599999999995
going on so that i wouldn't be like oh

5078.239 --> 5081.678999999999
no

5078.56 --> 5083.360000000001
panic i don't know what's wrong and i

5081.679 --> 5084.0
have to wait a very long time not

5083.36 --> 5086.239
knowing what to

5084.0 --> 5088.239
do that was really the reason why i just

5086.239 --> 5089.839999999999
like okay i want to have a preliminary

5088.239 --> 5092.959999999999
understanding of like

5089.84 --> 5094.719
how cars work very superficial don't

5092.96 --> 5097.199
have to know all the details

5094.719 --> 5099.84
so they could at least size up analyze

5097.199 --> 5099.839999999999
the situation

5100.719 --> 5104.159
so that yeah

5104.8 --> 5110.159000000001
could at least not panic and all that oh

5108.639 --> 5111.12
by the way thank you that flat fellow

5110.159 --> 5115.28
for the 99

5111.12 --> 5115.28
cent super chat donation appreciate it

5118.32 --> 5120.639
all right

okay be right back in a few minutes

5236.84 --> 5239.84
huh

5256.239 --> 5266.08
wow some of you guys seem to know a lot

5258.48 --> 5268.638999999999
about this

interesting

[Music]

5274.0 --> 5278.84
another effective weapon is a sling if

5276.32 --> 5293.92
you know how to use it

5278.84 --> 5294.96
absolutely it's kind of difficult though

5293.92 --> 5298.4800000000005
you have any cool

5294.96 --> 5302.4800000000005
footage from p900 yes i have

5298.48 --> 5305.12
i posted it a whole yeah a while back

5302.48 --> 5307.599999999999
it's in this in the playlist of moon

5305.12 --> 5310.08
gazing

5307.6 --> 5311.76
at my channel there's a separate

5310.08 --> 5314.0
playlist so you can check it out over

5311.76 --> 5314.0
there

5314.8 --> 5323.84
and i got a couple of good shots

5328.639 --> 5330.96
all right

5333.199 --> 5340.0
i had one really special shot when i was

5336.239 --> 5343.44
looking very close up at the moon

5340.0 --> 5344.8
with a good still shot filming and then

5343.44 --> 5347.759999999999
like an airplane

5344.8 --> 5351.360000000001
went straight straight in front of it

5347.76 --> 5354.719
well that was an incredible sight

5351.36 --> 5357.12
that was a very special very special

5354.719 --> 5357.12
footage

5360.239 --> 5364.4
because it was so incredibly close up so

5362.96 --> 5368.08
like the plane

5364.4 --> 5370.719
really took up it was like

5368.08 --> 5372.4
all already zoomed in on the plane that

5370.719 --> 5373.44
i didn't even expect would be there in

5372.4 --> 5379.04
the shot

5373.44 --> 5382.5599999999995
it's really special

5379.04 --> 5382.56
all right anyway

5388.56 --> 5396.8
seems like all the trolls have left

5393.12 --> 5396.8
through all this technology talk

5400.88 --> 5407.4400000000005
yeah i know yeah i'd link you to it

5405.12 --> 5408.239
but i don't think i can i can't even

5407.44 --> 5410.638999999999
link to

5408.239 --> 5412.159
other videos that are on my own channel

5410.639 --> 5414.719
i think

5412.159 --> 5416.96
although i haven't really checked it

5414.719 --> 5421.84
could

5416.96 --> 5421.84
i could check it see if that is the case

5425.28 --> 5429.759999999999
maybe it's just two other channels i

5427.36 --> 5429.759999999999
don't know

5429.92 --> 5432.32
let's see

5433.28 --> 5436.239
one gaze in

5436.639 --> 5439.12
what the

5443.44 --> 5449.839999999999
all right

5454.4 --> 5456.879999999999
let's see

5457.92 --> 5463.84
let's see if this works but just put in

5460.84 --> 5463.84
that

5471.04 --> 5473.44
what

5474.639 --> 5477.84
this is insane

5478.4 --> 5482.239
you can't even put freaking code

5480.239 --> 5486.638999999999
together

5482.239 --> 5491.839999999999
this is crazy it's so specific

5486.639 --> 5491.84
okay what if i just put a space

5492.719 --> 5497.84
yeah i put two spaces in there let's see

5494.719 --> 5497.84
if it does it now

5498.0 --> 5518.48
god so you have to take the spaces out

5503.6 --> 5520.8
if it's even going to show up

5518.48 --> 5520.799999999999
what

5526.08 --> 5529.28
this is insane

5529.76 --> 5535.52
yeah no [ __ ] it's crap but that's like

5532.719 --> 5535.52
what the [ __ ]

5537.04 --> 5540.719
like i put spaces in between it and even

5539.84 --> 5542.639
then it's

5540.719 --> 5546.639
it's blocking it out i've never seen

5542.639 --> 5560.08
anything like this

5546.639 --> 5561.92
like how are they even doing that

5560.08 --> 5563.6
well maybe i'll just have to show it

5561.92 --> 5566.8
then

5563.6 --> 5569.1990000000005
right youtube it's my own freaking

5566.8 --> 5569.1990000000005
channel

5570.32 --> 5575.84
jesus this is madness

5578.88 --> 5589.84
all right let's check it out

5593.84 --> 5602.96
good evening this is irwin

5598.8 --> 5607.4400000000005
look at that i thought

5602.96 --> 5611.36
that's finally a patch of clear sky

5607.44 --> 5611.36
blah blah blah let's check out the moon

5612.56 --> 5618.96
in a proper way instead of that silly

5616.159 --> 5631.04
webcam all of the time

5618.96 --> 5634.96
so let me just find the right moment

5631.04 --> 5634.96
all right okay it should be over here

5637.84 --> 5645.84
see how close up

5649.679 --> 5652.0
whoa

5653.28 --> 5660.639
right so that was the magic moment

5658.239 --> 5664.48
it's smaller than i remember it to be

5660.639 --> 5664.4800000000005
but yeah it's still pretty awesome

5668.4 --> 5677.04
so you have to dig that one out

5673.679 --> 5677.04
but it is in the playlist

5678.159 --> 5691.599999999999
on my channels

5686.48 --> 5691.599999999999
it's from october 8 2019

5695.28 --> 5701.679
yeah and it was indeed the

5698.56 --> 5705.119000000001
the first footage with the p900

5701.679 --> 5708.0
when i just got my tripod pretty crazy

5705.119 --> 5708.32
to catch something like this right it's

5708.0 --> 5711.36
like

5708.32 --> 5714.0
immediately getting the full benefit of

5711.36 --> 5729.839999999999
having that tripod

5714.0 --> 5729.84
pretty awesome

5739.119 --> 5744.159
put it on the chain wax what does that

5754.84 --> 5757.84
mean

5766.239 --> 5773.919999999999
okay i don't recognize that terminology

5770.0 --> 5773.92
but sure thanks

5775.36 --> 5779.759999999999
it's still just lucky though because i

5777.92 --> 5781.52
wasn't planning for that i was just

5779.76 --> 5784.56
looking at the moon and then that plane

5781.52 --> 5799.84
just happened to fly through i no idea

5784.56 --> 5799.84
was coming

5810.84 --> 5813.84
hmm

5828.32 --> 5834.639
right anyway got 10 more minutes

5831.52 --> 5838.080000000001
so anything else you guys

5834.639 --> 5839.92
girls want me to address

5838.08 --> 5842.0
because i have no more input really on

5839.92 --> 5843.679
the hydrogen engine situation i pretty

5842.0 --> 5844.96
much laid it down you guys are talking

5843.679 --> 5846.96
about it

5844.96 --> 5849.28
but mechanical details of things you

5846.96 --> 5850.88
apparently tested out that i have no

5849.28 --> 5853.119
idea about

5850.88 --> 5855.84
is there fed today yes there should be

5853.119 --> 5855.839999999999
it's already

5856.32 --> 5862.639
there's already an announcement for it

5860.32 --> 5865.44
and there's the google meet links in

5862.639 --> 5865.4400000000005
chat so

5866.84 --> 5869.84
yes

5879.119 --> 5887.599999999999
so yeah for that uh go to nathan

5882.639 --> 5887.6
oakley 1918 80 channel

5888.32 --> 5891.44
that's where it's going live

5894.8 --> 5898.719
just write out the name then

5903.92 --> 5908.08
no [ __ ] juice your link did not show

5906.639 --> 5912.32
because links no longer

5908.08 --> 5913.44
show at all any not even if you just cut

5912.32 --> 5915.199
out most of it

5913.44 --> 5916.96
except for the core essential and then

5915.199 --> 5919.678999999999
put spaces in between that

5916.96 --> 5920.159
even then it just doesn't show anymore

5919.679 --> 5922.4
so

5920.159 --> 5923.759999999999
youtube completely destroyed linking

5922.4 --> 5939.839999999999
function

5923.76 --> 5939.84
it's all gone

5956.08 --> 5959.92
i'm gonna try something out though

5961.199 --> 5964.239
because maybe i can like maybe this is

5963.44 --> 5981.839999999999
like a weird

5964.239 --> 5981.839999999999
thingy gonna try to

6001.119 --> 6006.799999999999
nope no no there's doesn't seem to be

6003.04 --> 6006.8
any kind of specific

6006.84 --> 6011.1990000000005
function

6008.08 --> 6011.199
even addressing it

6013.52 --> 6018.159000000001
it's just no more links it's just no

6015.28 --> 6020.159
longer allowed apparently

6018.159 --> 6023.839999999999
does there's nothing even addressing it

6020.159 --> 6023.839999999999
in the options

6027.119 --> 6037.839999999999
link to stop copyright issues no no that

6030.4 --> 6037.839999999999
doesn't make any sense

6053.92 --> 6057.28
so makes it harder to connect with

6056.32 --> 6060.96
like-minded

6057.28 --> 6064.32
how about any channel all channels it's

6060.96 --> 6068.4800000000005
just completely making this it's a

6064.32 --> 6073.92
severe downgrade to the social media

6068.48 --> 6076.239
functionality of youtube major downgrade

6073.92 --> 6079.84
they're turning it more like into just a

6076.239 --> 6079.839999999999
library book now

6080.0 --> 6084.08
you just have to be lucky that somebody

6082.239 --> 6084.799999999999
is just telling you where to go and

6084.08 --> 6086.5599999999995
helping you

6084.8 --> 6090.320000000001
find that channel now because you can't

6086.56 --> 6090.320000000001
just straightforward link to it anymore

6090.4 --> 6110.159
it's it's total lunacy

6107.84 --> 6113.6
no no george sanford yeah but the thing

6110.159 --> 6115.599999999999
is they have a monopoly position

6113.6 --> 6116.639
they very much do there's alternatives

6115.6 --> 6118.719
but none of them

6116.639 --> 6120.400000000001
are are even close to having the power

6118.719 --> 6123.36
and also

6120.4 --> 6123.36
look youtube

6124.239 --> 6130.4
it's not entirely a private endeavor

6128.0 --> 6132.239
it isn't it was even set up with

6130.4 --> 6136.32
government help

6132.239 --> 6139.28
so it's just wrong it's like

6136.32 --> 6139.28
i don't yeah

6139.76 --> 6142.8
they're supposedly part of a corporation

6141.92 --> 6145.6
but they have

6142.8 --> 6148.0
already like they have had subsidies and

6145.6 --> 6151.92
all that so it isn't technically really

6148.0 --> 6155.6
you see they should not be able to just

6151.92 --> 6157.6
fool around with it like it's their

6155.6 --> 6160.96
private home

6157.6 --> 6166.2390000000005
because public money did go into it

6160.96 --> 6168.159
into its conception into its buildup

6166.239 --> 6170.799999999999
not to mention that all the private

6168.159 --> 6173.36
effort of people doing things on youtube

6170.8 --> 6175.84
and making channels and all that

6173.36 --> 6177.839999999999
so it's just i don't see it it's like oh

6175.84 --> 6180.88
they can do whatever they want

6177.84 --> 6181.119000000001
look if it's your private endeavor like

6180.88 --> 6184.32
a

6181.119 --> 6186.799999999999
separate thing like for example d life

6184.32 --> 6189.28
d life was not set up by with any kind

6186.8 --> 6190.88
of government money or anything

6189.28 --> 6192.8
then i'd say yeah okay if they want to

6190.88 --> 6195.92
screw their platform yeah

6192.8 --> 6198.400000000001
they can do that youtube is way too

6195.92 --> 6198.4
massive

6199.679 --> 6207.84
and publicly invested into

6204.32 --> 6212.719
to to give them the same rules

6207.84 --> 6212.719
doesn't make sense doesn't make sense to

6216.84 --> 6219.84
me

6227.119 --> 6232.719
all right well i disagree with that a

6230.84 --> 6236.0
lot

6232.719 --> 6238.88
if governments make people

6236.0 --> 6239.6
through taxes pay for corporate

6238.88 --> 6242.88
endeavors

6239.6 --> 6243.76
then that makes it a public invested

6242.88 --> 6247.1990000000005
thing it's not

6243.76 --> 6249.679
a corporate private thing anymore

6247.199 --> 6251.839999999999
it's just a fact no matter what is said

6249.679 --> 6252.4
on contract or no matter if politicians

6251.84 --> 6255.6
are just

6252.4 --> 6257.92
giving it away just like that it doesn't

6255.6 --> 6257.92
matter

6258.96 --> 6265.04
doesn't matter to me like i think that

6262.8 --> 6266.08
if that was said to be done and

6265.04 --> 6269.199
contracts

6266.08 --> 6269.679
drawn up and signed by people in high

6269.199 --> 6272.799999999999
chamber

6269.679 --> 6275.679
chambers that does not make that

6272.8 --> 6277.92
actual in my opinion because it's just

6275.679 --> 6278.77
if it's publicly funded it's publicly

6277.92 --> 6280.4800000000005
funded

6278.77 --> 6283.119000000001
[Music]

6280.48 --> 6284.4
now unless they want to literally pay

6283.119 --> 6287.599999999999
all that tax money

6284.4 --> 6292.32
back and people receive it back

6287.6 --> 6294.88
yeah then sure now you're private

6292.32 --> 6296.48
that's cute then you can actually do

6294.88 --> 6299.76
whatever the [ __ ] you want but

6296.48 --> 6302.799999999999
until that time it's been invested in

6299.76 --> 6306.8
publicly with tax money and it just

6302.8 --> 6306.8
doesn't it shouldn't be like this

6307.199 --> 6309.678999999999
it's wrong

6311.84 --> 6316.0
anyway i am gonna round out the show so
