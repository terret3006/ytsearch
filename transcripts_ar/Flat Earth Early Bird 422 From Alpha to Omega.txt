228.769 --> 236.91
or well it wasn't that bad overall but I

232.2 --> 240.06
don't know I was getting some attitude

236.91 --> 244.44
here and there and then hello Fyodor

240.06 --> 248.25
Dostoevsky it was okay it was doable oh

244.44 --> 250.59

252.9 --> 265.62
flat earth debates panel day ah see yeah

260.519 --> 268.89
I was over at Iron Rail media and yeah

265.62 --> 272.84000000000003
oh the usual I was just hanging around

268.89 --> 277.82
and then suddenly for some reason

272.84 --> 281.36999999999995
started talking about I don't know

277.82 --> 283.34999999999997
last time I guess it was kind of in

281.37 --> 285.96
between tongue and cheek they didn't

283.35 --> 289.08000000000004
mention anyone's name but I'm pretty

285.96 --> 295.68
sure they were talking about me and they

289.08 --> 298.08
were like old attitude negativity why we

295.68 --> 302.73
don't need that here and I was like wait

298.08 --> 304.97999999999996
are you seriously calling me a troll so

302.73 --> 307.91900000000004
yeah I didn't proceed trolling I was

304.98 --> 312.48
just kind of outraged and just said like

307.919 --> 317.84
can I please just be able to express

312.48 --> 321.09000000000003
myself as I usually do I you know and

317.84 --> 323.19
then yeah I don't know

321.09 --> 327.33
it's some kind of really really bad joke

323.19 --> 329.58
that just didn't yeah what it hit a bad

327.33 --> 332.60999999999996
place for me

329.58 --> 335.09999999999997
what is it the what's his name dammit

332.61 --> 337.04
but yeah the channel owner he timed me

335.1 --> 339.24
out because he thought it was funny

337.04 --> 341.43
because I complained about it so much

339.24 --> 345.57
after they pretty much talked about me

341.43 --> 349.05
like that for ten minutes and I didn't

345.57 --> 350.25
even name Bob by name or yeah didn't

349.05 --> 355.53000000000003
even say anything

350.25 --> 357.3
mean John Savage right sorry about that

355.53 --> 362.46
yeah I forget his name every time I

357.3 --> 365.64
don't know why but yeah I didn't like

362.46 --> 370.32
that at all I was like why are you doing

365.64 --> 373.11
that and then yeah you know who Cammie

370.32 --> 375.57
was kind of clothing over it a little

373.11 --> 378.66
just a little but it's just you know I

375.57 --> 381.12
don't like that kind of [ __ ] I used the

378.66 --> 381.84000000000003
the last place I've really experienced

381.12 --> 384.27
that where I

381.84 --> 387.23999999999995
didn't expect it were on the other

384.27 --> 389.78999999999996
flatters channels like Antonio su Barret

387.24 --> 392.01
circles they do that [ __ ] all the time

389.79 --> 393.87
first they tied me out and then they

392.01 --> 396.36
started laughing at me and making jokes

393.87 --> 397.949
about me I'm really sick about that yeah

396.36 --> 400.35
and then yeah Nathan Oakley you

397.949 --> 404.16
complained you explained it to me over

400.35 --> 406.16900000000004
Skype I appreciate it you yeah you

404.16 --> 408.0
didn't realize the situation you'd had

406.169 --> 410.03999999999996
just popped in you saw me you thought it

408.0 --> 413.25
was funny to tide me out I get it it's

410.04 --> 416.58000000000004
like a bad timing thing I didn't know

413.25 --> 418.74
who it was when that happened I didn't

416.58 --> 421.05
think it was you you can't see it you

418.74 --> 423.24
know I can't see you can't see who you

421.05 --> 425.1
are time that only everybody else can

423.24 --> 428.79
see that it's a really it's really

425.1 --> 433.08000000000004
annoying actually that you can't see who

428.79 --> 436.97900000000004
timed you out in youtube I don't know

433.08 --> 439.08
why I don't like it you used to be able

436.979 --> 440.88
to see that when you got timed out so

439.08 --> 441.62
who did it but you don't see that

440.88 --> 445.74
anymore

441.62 --> 448.53000000000003
only people with wrenches see it I think

445.74 --> 450.99
I don't know anyway yeah after that I

448.53 --> 454.95
was kind of like yeah I'm sick of this

450.99 --> 458.36
and I also didn't like how Adam was

454.95 --> 460.889
basically just going along with it and

458.36 --> 461.40000000000003
basically calling me a troll I I don't

460.889 --> 463.74
get it

461.4 --> 466.5
and all this talking about negativity

463.74 --> 468.539
like oh I am so negative you all guys

466.5 --> 472.52
all know me about how incredibly

468.539 --> 475.83
negative I get you know it's like

472.52 --> 479.82
seriously even when I kind of troll I

475.83 --> 482.15999999999997
try to do it in a funny way and still be

479.82 --> 485.07
so yeah basically symbolic or

482.16 --> 488.61
descriptive but still funny and I never

485.07 --> 492.139
just call somebody I try to prevent

488.61 --> 495.03000000000003
using words like [ __ ] unless it's like

492.139 --> 499.38
some certain types of ballers that just

495.03 --> 502.95
are so gushingly dumb yeah then I will

499.38 --> 507.539
call them a [ __ ] but you know I don't

502.95 --> 509.58
I never call flat-earthers retards I

507.539 --> 511.919
don't know if I called Bob a [ __ ] I

509.58 --> 514.02
may have during the ever after show I

511.919 --> 515.43
might have called him a couple of times

514.02 --> 516.15
you know but I had a couple of drinks

515.43 --> 518.0989999999999
and we

516.15 --> 520.8299999999999
yeah and though like those two shows we

518.099 --> 523.8000000000001
were pretty much all getting on top of

520.83 --> 526.8000000000001
it and yeah I'm not proud to say I I

523.8 --> 529.8299999999999
kind of tend to get dragged into that

526.8 --> 531.75
big and in this case also because I had

529.83 --> 534.5600000000001
a lot of things that I was sitting on

531.75 --> 541.08
I've been sitting on for years

534.56 --> 543.39
yeah I hold things in you know when I

541.08 --> 545.94
don't think it's viable to go after a

543.39 --> 547.4399999999999
person for their bad behavior or

545.94 --> 549.2700000000001
whatever and I think that there's still

547.44 --> 551.9100000000001
something viable to whatever they're

549.27 --> 554.0699999999999
doing and a in a way I still think there

551.91 --> 556.4399999999999
is something viable to Bob what Bob is

554.07 --> 560.0100000000001
doing that's the whole issue it just

556.44 --> 563.99
can't handle it so now yeah iron rel

560.01 --> 567.0
media is just become Bob rel media

563.99 --> 569.04
because he put his foot in there and

567.0 --> 571.65
everything he put his foot in is part of

569.04 --> 574.86
his empire and in his empire you cannot

571.65 --> 577.14
criticize him or talk negative in any

574.86 --> 580.23
type of direction or you'll get [ __ ]

577.14 --> 583.17
from everyone from everyone that's all

580.23 --> 584.97
yeah Bob links all the Bob links we'll

583.17 --> 587.279
start timing you out and start boosting

584.97 --> 591.14
all your negative negative

587.279 --> 595.32
it's Savannah shed its Savannah a soft

591.14 --> 598.92
but it's very annoying I hate that [ __ ]

595.32 --> 601.62
and yeah if this is gonna be standard

598.92 --> 603.209
now if this is going to be standard at

601.62 --> 605.67
IRL media yeah I'm not going there

603.209 --> 609.39
anymore and I demonstrated fleece and

605.67 --> 610.92
subscribe you know I used to kind of

609.39 --> 613.77
like it to hang around and to just be

610.92 --> 615.12
able to talk just say goofy [ __ ] you

613.77 --> 618.029
know it was one of the chats that I

615.12 --> 619.5
could just say goofy [ __ ] it it was kind

618.029 --> 621.45
of funny hang around with the guys well

619.5 --> 621.9
now every time I'm there I can't do that

621.45 --> 624.36
anymore

621.9 --> 627.51
because I have to be careful not to

624.36 --> 629.13
upset the Bob Ling's you know or make

627.51 --> 631.14
sure the Bob Ling's are not in a bad

629.13 --> 634.77
mood because of something I said a week

631.14 --> 641.25
ago you know that sucks it's not funny

634.77 --> 644.36
it's not funny anymore so yeah I'm glad

641.25 --> 644.36
to get that off my chest

646.399 --> 669.689
yeah yeah ba blinks I like it

654.889 --> 672.989
Bob links Bob earthers you know okay

669.689 --> 675.299
yeah that's fine

672.989 --> 680.97
well I'm not unsubscribing from Adam you

675.299 --> 685.019
know I just really didn't like daddy

680.97 --> 686.97
when good got along to go he went along

685.019 --> 691.289
to go along I just didn't like that and

686.97 --> 695.669
I don't know I'm not really hurt I'm

691.289 --> 697.799
just disappointed but I yeah that's not

695.669 --> 702.2289999999999
the reason there why I answer I just

697.799 --> 702.2289999999999
unsubscribe because this yeah I don't

702.859 --> 710.369
it's now yeah Bob RL media and yeah that

708.149 --> 713.489
is an exaggeration it is like an Owen

710.369 --> 716.399
Benjamin a vacation I know it's like I

713.489 --> 720.539
put it a little bit over at the top you

716.399 --> 724.829
know it's not even that bad but it's

720.539 --> 727.649
just bad for me because I can't be free

724.829 --> 728.159
to say whatever I want to say there

727.649 --> 730.739
anymore

728.159 --> 735.659
as I used to and that is what I liked

730.739 --> 737.4290000000001
about that channel so yeah but sure I'll

735.659 --> 740.789
I'll talk with Adam you know if he wants

737.429 --> 745.4889999999999
to Skype me I'm open for that it's a

740.789 --> 745.489
Saturday show and I got plenty of time

745.609 --> 755.519
also don't forget I am gonna livestream

750.829 --> 759.8889999999999
the recording of Thursday so there's

755.519 --> 765.559
gonna be an after show after party as

759.889 --> 765.559
per the intro that Adam made for me so

774.41 --> 779.2099999999999
talk about the triangular loop ISM

777.29 --> 784.13
that's an interesting one

779.21 --> 787.82
you mean irregular looping flat earth or

784.13 --> 791.03
it's not rectangular but yeah we're

787.82 --> 793.25
spatial non-linearity makes well the

791.03 --> 796.9399999999999
presumed North to be a shorter distance

793.25 --> 800.65
than the South it's just a model though

796.94 --> 803.3900000000001
you know I I don't know what the exact

800.65 --> 806.75
spatial interconnection is of it all you

803.39 --> 809.54
know we first have to go by the actual

806.75 --> 813.35
equator what is the orientation of it

809.54 --> 816.01
and we can see we can get more precise

813.35 --> 816.01
from there on

822.82 --> 826.0490000000001
[Music]

831.11 --> 834.989
[Music]

845.56 --> 850.8
what kind of ridiculous question is that

847.839 --> 850.8000000000001
miss crazy yet

873.34 --> 880.64
hmm.well flyer spaceman

875.6 --> 885.2900000000001
you have a point well I wouldn't call it

880.64 --> 889.67
a cult though it's more like a kingdom a

885.29 --> 893.3299999999999
social media Kingdom and yeah Bob does

889.67 --> 900.41
has it and in a way own Benjamin has it

893.33 --> 904.19
as well but he also has it because it's

900.41 --> 906.29
just a huge pile of people and he's

904.19 --> 908.6300000000001
dealing with guy he's really trying to

906.29 --> 911.87
rout out gamma behavior and he does kind

908.63 --> 913.97
of accept contrary views it's just he's

911.87 --> 918.83
very meticulous on how you're gonna

913.97 --> 922.64
present it he's he's nitpicky about the

918.83 --> 925.7
details and he has like this very quick

922.64 --> 927.89
eye to spot things that he thinks all

925.7 --> 932.9300000000001
right yeah he is that's just the way he

927.89 --> 936.71
is but I find that a lot more tolerable

932.93 --> 940.04
and yeah because he does allow goofy

936.71 --> 943.46
[ __ ] II just I don't know I can still do

940.04 --> 946.4599999999999
a lot with what Big Bear but on Benjamin

943.46 --> 948.95
does and besides there's always a two

946.46 --> 950.5400000000001
minute delay on there on the chat anyway

948.95 --> 955.3100000000001
so I'm not gonna be able to say that

950.54 --> 957.3499999999999
much it just I don't know I like a lot

955.31 --> 960.5899999999999
more about what Owen Benjamin has to say

957.35 --> 962.66
in general I find his topics extremely

960.59 --> 968.36
interesting and very wide spreading and

962.66 --> 972.53
his insights are very sharp and his

968.36 --> 974.8100000000001
comedy I think it's very relieving and I

972.53 --> 978.9499999999999
get it and I really don't get why people

974.81 --> 981.29
get out so so upset about him supposedly

978.95 --> 985.5500000000001
being racist and all that nonsense and

981.29 --> 989.06
it's just they just don't get it you

985.55 --> 992.0799999999999
know there there's literally you have

989.06 --> 996.5
black people writing Owen Benjamin

992.08 --> 999.1700000000001
letters about how they are bike thieves

996.5 --> 1003.01
under control they get it because it is

999.17 --> 1004.8499999999999
a joke it is a joke to try to undo

1003.01 --> 1008.63
damage to the language

1004.85 --> 1012.2900000000001
and I get that and there's just a lot of

1008.63 --> 1018.08
people that done get that and very sorry

1012.29 --> 1021.38
for these people huh

1018.08 --> 1024.65
okay I was a that's interesting Jose

1021.38 --> 1026.63
says he did a Spanish speaking show

1024.65 --> 1037.01
yesterday on somebody else's channel

1026.63 --> 1039.38
cool you know go for it yeah on another

1037.01 --> 1041.8
note talking about being pissed off

1039.38 --> 1044.72
about people

1041.8 --> 1046.8799999999999
david weiss deep beside the rabbit hole

1044.72 --> 1049.46
posted the video and i'm not pissed at

1046.88 --> 1052.88
him then just to be clear but yeah he

1049.46 --> 1056.0900000000001
posted very short video from god Mike

1052.88 --> 1061.16
Adams just typical things that he does

1056.09 --> 1063.53
it's oh yes one minute 60 seconds just

1061.16 --> 1068.44
some of the globe [ __ ] that he says and

1063.53 --> 1073.1
he actually had the balls call the balls

1068.44 --> 1076.1000000000001
to try to peer pressure peep yeah flat

1073.1 --> 1079.79
earthers with like yeah do you realize

1076.1 --> 1082.55
we look at you or regular Pete you're we

1079.79 --> 1084.8799999999999
so regular P for everyone else typical

1082.55 --> 1090.71
baller everyone else looks at you just

1084.88 --> 1096.47
like we look at like transgender things

1090.71 --> 1100.31
it's like wow that was such a insult

1096.47 --> 1103.33
like if he yeah he should know better

1100.31 --> 1105.56
it's that was like a low blow and

1103.33 --> 1108.26
combining them with everything else I'm

1105.56 --> 1109.1
really sick of the guy like you know

1108.26 --> 1111.41
Mike Adams

1109.1 --> 1113.4199999999998
I appreciate the things that you've done

1111.41 --> 1116.66
in the past even though there you have a

1113.42 --> 1120.95
dubious past you know don't forget that

1116.66 --> 1122.5700000000002
he's an open admitted Scientologist okay

1120.95 --> 1128.18
yeah yes

1122.57 --> 1130.4299999999998
so I record as stuff he did before yeah

1128.18 --> 1133.19
he went into this format before he like

1130.43 --> 1135.29
got his laboratory and everything he was

1133.19 --> 1138.1100000000001
kind of open about that in the past so

1135.29 --> 1141.59
yeah that's one thing like the

1138.11 --> 1144.039
and yeah now with this shed it just

1141.59 --> 1148.73
seems like he's yeah he's doubling down

1144.039 --> 1151.7
on the religion for whatever reasons but

1148.73 --> 1154.159
doing this these low blows it just it's

1151.7 --> 1160.73
a bad character so at trade it's a bad

1154.159 --> 1162.38
sign but yeah you know Mike Adams used

1160.73 --> 1165.679
to like you but you could really go

1162.38 --> 1168.919
screw yourself at this point you know

1165.679 --> 1175.7
stop straw Manning us it's really

1168.919 --> 1177.6490000000001
aggravating so yeah my god and why

1175.7 --> 1179.269
didn't you actually go up against

1177.649 --> 1181.85
somebody real why don't you go up

1179.269 --> 1182.299
against Nathan Oakley why don't you go

1181.85 --> 1186.86
up

1182.299 --> 1189.019
I wouldn't recommend John but why don't

1186.86 --> 1191.12
you go up I would go up against Mike

1189.019 --> 1193.3700000000001
Adams you know especially because I do

1191.12 --> 1195.11
respect him and I hope that for what

1193.37 --> 1198.139
he's done in the past and I hope that he

1195.11 --> 1202.309
will kind of hold back the nastiness

1198.139 --> 1204.9189999999999
because of that or maybe he'd like to

1202.309 --> 1208.1299999999999
see what happens when you really kind of

1204.919 --> 1209.2990000000002
betray your fans because of your

1208.13 --> 1213.0800000000002
religious reasons

1209.299 --> 1214.8799999999999
hey mmm I don't know but I'm up for that

1213.08 --> 1219.37
why don't why doesn't he actually debate

1214.88 --> 1223.6390000000001
somebody real instead of some plucked

1219.37 --> 1226.85
hey yeah weirdo flat earthers that kind

1223.639 --> 1228.889
of thing like what Alex Jones does when

1226.85 --> 1231.019
I doesn't do that exactly you know a

1228.889 --> 1234.4399999999998
David Weiss was on Alex Jones of course

1231.019 --> 1237.73
but I don't know let's see a real debate

1234.44 --> 1241.3890000000001
with my two atoms concerning Flat Earth

1237.73 --> 1241.3890000000001
I'd like to see that

1241.4 --> 1245.98
and then yeah maybe I'll get some

1243.8 --> 1248.09
respect back for him but what he did

1245.98 --> 1254.51
recently that's just it was just

1248.09 --> 1257.33
disgusting you know so yeah do check out

1254.51 --> 1260.39
the video if advice post it so you know

1257.33 --> 1263.53
what I'm talking about I'm posting the

1260.39 --> 1263.5300000000002
link in chat right now

1264.79 --> 1273.1399999999999
yeah I know Dave Dave is great you know

1268.4 --> 1275.42
he's a bit of a disc that's not as far

1273.14 --> 1281.179
as I know that's not an official insult

1275.42 --> 1284.8400000000001
word but yeah he is a great guy he has

1281.179 --> 1287.7800000000002
critical thought he does realize it's

1284.84 --> 1292.6599999999999
not perfect but he's just going for that

1287.78 --> 1292.66
model as it were and yeah I get it

1304.09 --> 1310.3999999999999
well flatter spaceman Infowars

1307.52 --> 1314.93
yeah I still do check it out every now

1310.4 --> 1319.3100000000002
and then but it's just a lot of politics

1314.93 --> 1321.3700000000001
and baller stuff mostly and hey some of

1319.31 --> 1325.48
it I still kind of find it interesting

1321.37 --> 1328.25
but yeah it's not for everyone and

1325.48 --> 1332.09
there's you have plenty of times where I

1328.25 --> 1334.97
wear a I click on it and it just click

1332.09 --> 1339.85
away after like two minutes

1334.97 --> 1339.8500000000001
so to each their own

1341.17 --> 1347.66
but yeah I'm I'm getting a bit sick of

1344.27 --> 1354.5
the overall standard fare porn that that

1347.66 --> 1355.94
you get subjected to Alex Jones now it's

1354.5 --> 1365.35
dirty testers

1355.94 --> 1368.98
now then this curves aren't dirty

1365.35 --> 1368.98
flatter spaceman

1387.92 --> 1392.179
George Sanford asks I heard stores are

1390.62 --> 1394.76
disappearing is that true can anyone

1392.179 --> 1397.73
confirm this well I can't personally

1394.76 --> 1402.23
confirm it but I've heard similar things

1397.73 --> 1407.14
yes and even from my visions there was

1402.23 --> 1411.38
this thing like stars going away and

1407.14 --> 1414.2900000000002
yeah it was very surreal but I think

1411.38 --> 1416.39
that it's yeah there could be several

1414.29 --> 1419.42
things that would be causing that it

1416.39 --> 1421.3090000000002
could be because of just the mining

1419.42 --> 1423.38
going on if there is indeed a direct

1421.309 --> 1426.77
correlation with the matter in the earth

1423.38 --> 1430.0100000000002
which I have conceptualized pretty early

1426.77 --> 1432.3799999999999
on even that could be a reason that like

1430.01 --> 1435.85
specific crystalline locations have been

1432.38 --> 1439.0400000000002
harvested and so the correlating star

1435.85 --> 1442.25
apparition the light of that location

1439.04 --> 1444.6499999999999
that reflects itself in the sky it may

1442.25 --> 1449.57
disappear that could be a reason or it's

1444.65 --> 1452.21
just astrological it's just part of the

1449.57 --> 1455.6899999999998
of the whole astral or you have the

1452.21 --> 1458.21
whole star patterns and the eclipses and

1455.69 --> 1460.49
all that who knows maybe it has been

1458.21 --> 1468.41
even predicted certain stars will

1460.49 --> 1471.02
disappear I don't know it doesn't really

1468.41 --> 1473.75
mean anything to me you know I know that

1471.02 --> 1476.09
the heliocentric then lost a speck like

1473.75 --> 1479.54
oh it's just it went super know if I

1476.09 --> 1483.8899999999999
were imploded into a black hole or blah

1479.54 --> 1486.94
blah blah whatever so just story time to

1483.89 --> 1493.96
me it's just lights disappearing

1486.94 --> 1493.96
specifically specific starlight yeah

1496.75 --> 1506.45
yes theater Dostoevsky I completely

1499.429 --> 1507.92
agree although you know Fyodor

1506.45 --> 1509.75
Dostoevsky there is this thing to it

1507.92 --> 1513.3200000000002
like there's the pure supplement

1509.75 --> 1518.45
advertisements and then there is the the

1513.32 --> 1520.309
clips like few piece clips you usually

1518.45 --> 1523.57
recognize it when there's and because

1520.309 --> 1526.01
there's a standard using music

1523.57 --> 1528.2
specifically chosen going all throughout

1526.01 --> 1532.1
it well some of these pieces are are

1528.2 --> 1534.74
pretty ok but yeah it they're repeated a

1532.1 --> 1537.9399999999998
lot especially yeah throughout the day

1534.74 --> 1540.74
they tend to get repeated several times

1537.94 --> 1548.24
so yeah that gets annoying eventually

1540.74 --> 1550.309
but yeah hey Alex really refreshes a lot

1548.24 --> 1553.19
of his advertisement I've paid attention

1550.309 --> 1555.32
over the years and he's just put a lot

1553.19 --> 1557.63
of energy and work into his

1555.32 --> 1560.3
advertisement and he constantly changes

1557.63 --> 1562.46
that vert Isaac refreshes it into

1560.3 --> 1566.54
something slightly different or new or

1562.46 --> 1568.82
adds on some testimony or for whatever

1566.54 --> 1573.62
that's worth from people that call in

1568.82 --> 1577.1
and all that yet so yeah it's just part

1573.62 --> 1579.9499999999998
of his show he does spend a lot of time

1577.1 --> 1581.62
and energy and money probably because of

1579.95 --> 1584.6200000000001
it because of just the coverage on

1581.62 --> 1584.62
advertisement

1588.07 --> 1591.1899999999998
[Music]

1592.389 --> 1596.599
right

1593.949 --> 1599.449
yeah well theatre does stuff yeah I kind

1596.599 --> 1602.299
of agree when Alex like gets Unleashed

1599.449 --> 1606.5890000000002
and he's like really energetic yeah then

1602.299 --> 1609.1689999999999
it can be interesting especially if he

1606.589 --> 1612.32
doesn't immediately dive off into fear

1609.169 --> 1614.1190000000001
porn because yeah he too has his

1612.32 --> 1617.239
interesting moments and interesting

1614.119 --> 1620.599
insights and it's very curious about the

1617.239 --> 1625.339
other dimensions and all that stuff and

1620.599 --> 1629.359
hey I get it and there is some viability

1625.339 --> 1633.259
to it I just think that he's had similar

1629.359 --> 1635.629
type of visions in his own way is even

1633.259 --> 1637.549
yeah I explained that several times that

1635.629 --> 1641.329
is he was really young he would get that

1637.549 --> 1643.249
stuff and I had that as well so maybe

1641.329 --> 1647.739
he's had his own type of visions that

1643.249 --> 1647.739
he's reflecting upon with what he does I

1649.599 --> 1655.879
don't know or maybe if that part is a

1652.819 --> 1658.4289999999999
complete LARP and he's just harvesting

1655.879 --> 1660.799
that kind of data from people like me

1658.429 --> 1663.1390000000001
and then constructing his own story I

1660.799 --> 1668.509
don't know at this point you know he

1663.139 --> 1671.269
could be just acting parts of what he

1668.509 --> 1674.569
does because he thinks it's interesting

1671.269 --> 1677.509
you know he's been caught blatantly

1674.569 --> 1679.569
lying to everyone but ridiculous stuff

1677.509 --> 1682.849
before like the whole Sandy Hook thing

1679.569 --> 1686.69
yeah and even that's funny by the way

1682.849 --> 1689.119
because yesterday wasn't yesterday was

1686.69 --> 1691.159
the time before Nathan Stockman from

1689.119 --> 1694.759
lift a veil over a deal I've also talked

1691.159 --> 1698.509
about that brought that up it's just

1694.759 --> 1701.629
yeah after such a point you know it is

1698.509 --> 1704.569
anything goes like if Alex chooses to he

1701.629 --> 1708.4399999999998
can just you know there's no more reason

1704.569 --> 1710.899
to basically uphold be being absolutely

1708.44 --> 1712.789
truthful and he can put an act into it

1710.899 --> 1718.839
if he feels like it because he's already

1712.789 --> 1720.53
went so far over the edge of decency by

1718.839 --> 1723.44
blatantly lying

1720.53 --> 1725.06
you had that situation for whatever

1723.44 --> 1729.3200000000002
reason it's just it doesn't really

1725.06 --> 1732.62
matter what the reason was it he he

1729.32 --> 1737.03
never really properly responded to that

1732.62 --> 1741.2199999999998
afterwards and he's still being a Sandy

1737.03 --> 1741.22
Hook apologist it's ridiculous

1741.7 --> 1751.57
yeah Nathan and Toshi are cool I don't

1747.86 --> 1755.06
know I like Nathan just has this feel

1751.57 --> 1758.57
you know he's a sensitive guy I think

1755.06 --> 1761.1499999999999
and he just has great a great sense for

1758.57 --> 1763.6399999999999
finding good sources and then it shows

1761.15 --> 1766.5400000000002
on the show he gets really interesting

1763.64 --> 1766.5400000000002
things in there

1768.27 --> 1771.46
[Music]

1783.58 --> 1789.1999999999998
right yeah although you know there are

1787.28 --> 1791.24
some issues too with Nathan and I kind

1789.2 --> 1795.26
of criticized him about it yeah and he

1791.24 --> 1797.809
doesn't tie me up for it okay because he

1795.26 --> 1804.169
yeah this is the issue I think he's a

1797.809 --> 1806.12
bit of a bit of a liberal apologist you

1804.169 --> 1807.74
know in a way I am kind of almost a

1806.12 --> 1810.53
Labour apologist even though I get

1807.74 --> 1813.23
pretty rough on it sometimes especially

1810.53 --> 1817.73
the DNI's corners the dark corners of

1813.23 --> 1820.94
liberalism but yeah Nathan is a big

1817.73 --> 1823.54
apologist even for for gays and all that

1820.94 --> 1826.8500000000001
like in a guess he is in even in the

1823.54 --> 1829.309
then what is it the gender fluid scene

1826.85 --> 1830.78
and all that he was like up for that and

1829.309 --> 1833.75
probably has something to do with his

1830.78 --> 1836.78
wife which is Britt who is British this

1833.75 --> 1839.21
you know they are all into that every

1836.78 --> 1843.2
British person I know especially the

1839.21 --> 1846.16
Liberals and that's most of them and

1843.2 --> 1848.929
they know Liberal English people but

1846.16 --> 1850.97
yeah that's probably a bit of a reason

1848.929 --> 1855.98
why and I do find it kind of like come

1850.97 --> 1859.54
on don't that's just you know but other

1855.98 --> 1862.52
than that yeah he he's a sensible guy

1859.54 --> 1865.27
not Nathan Thompson no Nathan Stockman

1862.52 --> 1869.11
from lift the veil no Nathan Thompson is

1865.27 --> 1872.48
definitely not a liberal apologist I

1869.11 --> 1875.6899999999998
even could say that he's a bit too harsh

1872.48 --> 1880.94
in his own way but he's very astute very

1875.69 --> 1883.64
sharp so I don't know I think he Nathan

1880.94 --> 1886.19
in his own way is just really trying to

1883.64 --> 1890.3300000000002
crush it really trying to follow the

1886.19 --> 1893.99
logos very strictly but also pretty

1890.33 --> 1898.299
wisely for somebody that still has also

1893.99 --> 1901.96
so much sharp energy now yeah Nathan

1898.299 --> 1905.05
Nathan Thompson is an impressive guy a

1901.96 --> 1911.38
bit intimidating

1905.05 --> 1916.62
anyway but yeah there's a lot of good

1911.38 --> 1920.14
Nathan's that I know lots of Nathan's

1916.62 --> 1924.25
and I all find them kind of impressive

1920.14 --> 1927.5500000000002
oh and they're all flat earthers -

1924.25 --> 1931.02
although yeah again Nathan yesterday

1927.55 --> 1933.76
went even almost as far as to be coming

1931.02 --> 1938.53
yeah

1933.76 --> 1941.74
a flexible flat earther he said like oh

1938.53 --> 1944.71
maybe it is a ball but not the way they

1941.74 --> 1946.9
say and I don't know he attempted a a

1944.71 --> 1950.14
Jupiter earth approach like what Riley

1946.9 --> 1952.3000000000002
does sometimes and when I when I'm being

1950.14 --> 1955.72
held my toes to the fire I do it

1952.3 --> 1958.45
sometimes - like okay could be remote

1955.72 --> 1960.63
option but he tried to do that then it

1958.45 --> 1969.27
was like really Nathan you're gonna

1960.63 --> 1972.16
you're not gonna go back to the bar oh

1969.27 --> 1974.68
yeah also through Nathan Stockman

1972.16 --> 1979.3300000000002
through lifts a veil over addy life I

1974.68 --> 1982.66
also got to see some of max Egan's the

1979.33 --> 1986.86
videos concerning his supposed coming

1982.66 --> 1988.63
out about Flat Earth and everything I've

1986.86 --> 1992.35
heard yeah I haven't watched that video

1988.63 --> 1994.69
I don't know why but I hadn't watched it

1992.35 --> 1998.1399999999999
yet and Nathan's showed a big chunk of

1994.69 --> 2002.25
it and to be fair I was actually really

1998.14 --> 2007.5
impressed really impressed I didn't

2002.25 --> 2011.19
expect that like he says things in a

2007.5 --> 2015.21
very condensed complex way but they're

2011.19 --> 2020.5800000000002
surprisingly refined and I think I get a

2015.21 --> 2024.81
lot of what he's saying but it is it's

2020.58 --> 2027.72
complex and it's like in ethereal ground

2024.81 --> 2029.97
so I he's kind of open about it so but I

2027.72 --> 2034.44
can actually kind of find it find it

2029.97 --> 2037.26
kind of fascinating and just curious as

2034.44 --> 2038.279
to like I'm now kind of curious as to

2037.26 --> 2040.499
more of the

2038.279 --> 2043.59
that he talks about and how he does that

2040.499 --> 2048.299
so maybe I might turn out to be kind of

2043.59 --> 2051.3289999999997
a Mexican fan and I've also I also think

2048.299 --> 2053.52
that from what I've seen that maybe his

2051.329 --> 2056.01
coming out of Flat Earth it was

2053.52 --> 2057.599
interpreted as yeah when talked about

2056.01 --> 2060.7400000000002
earlier that it might be some kind of

2057.599 --> 2062.7000000000003
controlled opposition that he's like

2060.74 --> 2065.7299999999996
blaspheming Flat Earth to get some

2062.7 --> 2068.24
credit or something and then but after

2065.73 --> 2077.69
what I've seen I kind of doubt that I

2068.24 --> 2083.5789999999997
really do yeah I was impressed by Max

2077.69 --> 2087.48
big not look because I think I get what

2083.579 --> 2090.96
he's trying to say you know expressing

2087.48 --> 2094.44
really complex overarching theory

2090.96 --> 2096.48
theories or systems especially when

2094.44 --> 2099.51
ethereal things are involved are just

2096.48 --> 2102.799
hyper complex to explain it's extra

2099.51 --> 2105.15
difficult I find it difficult and

2102.799 --> 2107.309
explaining complex things I kind of

2105.15 --> 2110.309
consider that as one of my specialties

2107.309 --> 2115.2000000000003
and I even find that extremely complex

2110.309 --> 2118.8190000000004
to do they often need time to do it over

2115.2 --> 2121.95
and over again and refine it as I go so

2118.819 --> 2124.13
yeah but I think I get what he's talking

2121.95 --> 2126.1499999999996
about and even to the whole matrix

2124.13 --> 2128.849
conceptualization I think I get the

2126.15 --> 2132.7200000000003
angle of that I think I understand where

2128.849 --> 2135.6600000000003
it's coming from and I even understand

2132.72 --> 2139.0789999999997
and this is the big thing because it

2135.66 --> 2141.6299999999997
seemed like he was discouraging people

2139.079 --> 2144.15
from going into conspiracy theories in

2141.63 --> 2146.7000000000003
from informing themselves but I think

2144.15 --> 2149.819
that's a misinterpretation of the intent

2146.7 --> 2153.4199999999996
of it because it was specifically about

2149.819 --> 2156.079
the emotions it's about his idea of that

2153.42 --> 2160.589
the demons the version that he gets it

2156.079 --> 2163.7400000000002
the entities even my healer works with

2160.589 --> 2166.47
this so it is a lot of viability to that

2163.74 --> 2168.27
approach that he has I kind of agree

2166.47 --> 2169.27
with it even though we may use slightly

2168.27 --> 2172.38
different words

2169.27 --> 2176.59
but yeah the entity or entities prey on

2172.38 --> 2181.1800000000003
people and if you get shocked or hurt or

2176.59 --> 2183.25
triggered then they will try to use the

2181.18 --> 2186.49
letdown of the guard to slip in and

2183.25 --> 2188.8
become a part yeah slip in bad behavior

2186.49 --> 2190.72
practically become a part of you with

2188.8 --> 2193.9900000000002
that essence with the dark essence and

2190.72 --> 2196.2
then corrupt you and that is a danger

2193.99 --> 2198.97
that's a danger to anyone who awakens

2196.2 --> 2203.0499999999997
because the awakening the awakening to

2198.97 --> 2205.1499999999996
the truth has to results on people you

2203.05 --> 2207.28
have to sleepers and you have the awaken

2205.15 --> 2209.8
the awakened wake up they become more

2207.28 --> 2212.2900000000004
conscious they see more that the

2209.8 --> 2216.4
illusions are dispelled to them but the

2212.29 --> 2219.1
sleepers the sleepers can do that they

2216.4 --> 2222.1
are they choose not to for whatever

2219.1 --> 2224.47
reason and so they double down on the

2222.1 --> 2227.11
illusions and they become more blinded

2224.47 --> 2229.0
to the truth they get more defense

2227.11 --> 2232.63
mechanisms in place to guard themselves

2229.0 --> 2235.03
against the truth to protect the lies

2232.63 --> 2238.03
that they need to keep in place in order

2235.03 --> 2240.9700000000003
to keep themselves stable that's the

2238.03 --> 2242.38
effect that's the sleeper so that is

2240.97 --> 2245.35
kind of what he was pointing at

2242.38 --> 2248.08
I believe so it didn't literally mean

2245.35 --> 2252.31
like oh you should know buddy and just

2248.08 --> 2255.1
don't don't do anything no it's a bad

2252.31 --> 2259.09
way of explaining what I just explained

2255.1 --> 2261.0699999999997
like it's not without risks when you go

2259.09 --> 2264.04
into deep heavy stuff you'll be shocked

2261.07 --> 2266.4700000000003
hey I was shocked remember 82 that's

2264.04 --> 2268.27
because I just was shoved with that

2266.47 --> 2271.02
stuff in my face and I couldn't handle

2268.27 --> 2274.84
it well that was a moment where yeah

2271.02 --> 2277.24
entities did slip in and I called my

2274.84 --> 2279.55
healer and he thanked God helped me to

2277.24 --> 2284.109
get rid of it or I might have been like

2279.55 --> 2286.119
super upset for a very long period so

2284.109 --> 2288.04
there is something to it awakening to

2286.119 --> 2291.79
information can just overwhelm you and

2288.04 --> 2295.6
then entities slip in that's a risk so

2291.79 --> 2298.0299999999997
it's important to have discipline to

2295.6 --> 2299.77
grow skin and to be prepared that you're

2298.03 --> 2301.38
going to be confronted with things that

2299.77 --> 2303.42
you might not be able to handle

2301.38 --> 2307.529
you need to be mentally prepared for it

2303.42 --> 2311.849
yeah don't just yeah

2307.529 --> 2315.509
don't be if ya don't wander in without

2311.849 --> 2316.92
defenses into new grounds basically so

2315.509 --> 2322.44
that's how I saw that

2316.92 --> 2324.42
and as for ya his approach of like any

2322.44 --> 2327.2690000000002
everything only the matrix Theory

2324.42 --> 2330.15
everything only exists because we

2327.269 --> 2333.749
experiencing it well that is a quantum

2330.15 --> 2336.779
based theory and I it's purely

2333.749 --> 2338.999
conceptual I don't really think it's

2336.779 --> 2341.489
true because I I kind of believe that

2338.999 --> 2345.319
the earth still exists even if there is

2341.489 --> 2347.91
nobody to experience it it's just that

2345.319 --> 2350.4
there may be something to it in an

2347.91 --> 2356.19
interdimensional way that isn't this is

2350.4 --> 2358.4990000000003
not the only form of existence the only

2356.19 --> 2361.859
dimension we can exist in it's just the

2358.499 --> 2364.229
only physical dimension so I think this

2361.859 --> 2368.009
physical dimension still exists even if

2364.229 --> 2369.779
there's no consciousness no human

2368.009 --> 2372.059
consciousness at least or of any type of

2369.779 --> 2373.709
consciousness engaging with it and I

2372.059 --> 2375.989
don't know the conditions for the realm

2373.709 --> 2378.209
like maybe if all life was extinguished

2375.989 --> 2380.339
it would literally employ self-employed

2378.209 --> 2383.3089999999997
and destroyer so I don't know nobody

2380.339 --> 2388.5589999999997
knows nobody knows for sure let's not

2383.309 --> 2393.119
try to find out but I personally believe

2388.559 --> 2395.19
that yeah this idea that things manifest

2393.119 --> 2398.2690000000002
because we perceive them I think that's

2395.19 --> 2404.539
a quantum fantasy routed in

2398.269 --> 2407.029
misconception based on effects that are

2404.539 --> 2410.4
extrapolated from mathematical

2407.029 --> 2416.249
interpretations using presuppositions of

2410.4 --> 2419.5190000000002
an invisible unit called light for

2416.249 --> 2421.9199999999996
example that's really kind of the path

2419.519 --> 2424.229
that I think that originally really

2421.92 --> 2427.529
comes from that's why I'm working on

2424.229 --> 2429.5899999999997
that to get a lot of illusions out of

2427.529 --> 2431.92
the way

2429.59 --> 2434.1800000000003
[Music]

2431.92 --> 2436.489
because I think that the whole quantum

2434.18 --> 2442.22
situation is is a myth I don't think

2436.489 --> 2445.43
that is real quantum computing for

2442.22 --> 2447.3799999999997
example I think that's a myth they put

2445.43 --> 2462.859
on top of it to cover for actual

2447.38 --> 2465.259
technical developments that are real so

2462.859 --> 2466.94
yeah but that's just some of the things

2465.259 --> 2470.2690000000002
I heard him about and then was talked

2466.94 --> 2476.119
about over at Nathan or nathan Stallman

2470.269 --> 2478.069
lived to fail and I liked it I liked

2476.119 --> 2481.489
what I heard so maybe I'll start

2478.069 --> 2483.979
listening to max Egan every now and then

2481.489 --> 2486.559
I I don't

2483.979 --> 2489.859
I'm not subscribed to his channel yet if

2486.559 --> 2491.4790000000003
anybody here is then would be nice if

2489.859 --> 2493.4
you could forward me the links but

2491.479 --> 2502.3089999999997
otherwise I'm just gonna search it out

2493.4 --> 2504.559
on on YouTube search for his name he was

2502.309 --> 2508.0690000000004
tripping on acid well I don't know maybe

2504.559 --> 2510.5190000000002
maybe Max Egan is actually is like a

2508.069 --> 2513.92
regular psychotropic drug user that

2510.519 --> 2517.8999999999996
certainly would have side effects on

2513.92 --> 2521.2690000000002
your faculty control or at least on the

2517.9 --> 2523.279
expressions of them because in my

2521.269 --> 2526.549
opinion the more psychotropics you take

2523.279 --> 2528.38
the more difficult it becomes for your

2526.549 --> 2530.5389999999998
mind to step out of that higher

2528.38 --> 2533.1800000000003
oversight realm and actually be able to

2530.539 --> 2536.2290000000003
translate it so it's like your mind kind

2533.18 --> 2539.269
of migrates away from being earthed

2536.229 --> 2541.3089999999997
into the body and into the communication

2539.269 --> 2545.479
that's an issue it that's why I don't

2541.309 --> 2547.579
encourage psychotropics for real that's

2545.479 --> 2550.7
and that's why I don't take it because

2547.579 --> 2554.42
I'm already I have natural risks of

2550.7 --> 2556.759
typically doing that because I have that

2554.42 --> 2558.469
naturally and I've just I have this

2556.759 --> 2561.17
higher realm and I've been working my

2558.469 --> 2562.4
entire life on basically trying to

2561.17 --> 2569.06
bridge that

2562.4 --> 2571.55
I even basically had practically

2569.06 --> 2574.7599999999998
rearranged my entire skill set to be

2571.55 --> 2578.77
able to do that it cries a lot of energy

2574.76 --> 2595.9300000000003
though and yeah it's not without its

2578.77 --> 2595.93
without its sacrifices what is that Bank

2609.89 --> 2618.0499999999997
the crow house okay

2613.43 --> 2618.0499999999997
is that max Egan's Channel

2628.6 --> 2631.29
dank

2643.23 --> 2648.51
all right well peanuts Clark if you if

2645.93 --> 2654.45
you're still talking about Mexican yeah

2648.51 --> 2662.9700000000003
you may have a point there but I don't

2654.45 --> 2665.06
know I it's it's too hard to tell at

2662.97 --> 2669.2
this point I only have preliminaries

2665.06 --> 2669.2
about max Egan so far

2676.29 --> 2679.409
[Music]

2680.17 --> 2691.0
okay well thanks Jose but hey I hope you

2686.74 --> 2693.91
heard I hope you heard me basically

2691.0 --> 2698.98
laying a very elaborate groundwork as

2693.91 --> 2700.6299999999997
how to how I think what he said should

2698.98 --> 2705.94
be interpreted now you can call that

2700.63 --> 2707.71
definition but hey who knows maybe maybe

2705.94 --> 2709.69
someday I will be able to get in the

2707.71 --> 2711.82
conversation and maybe he will be like

2709.69 --> 2713.35
hmm yeah yeah that's exactly what I mean

2711.82 --> 2716.2000000000003
I don't know I think it could be right

2713.35 --> 2720.31
here but I don't know I don't know max

2716.2 --> 2725.64
Egon I just seen maybe 20 minutes video

2720.31 --> 2730.42
of him total now but I was kind of yeah

2725.64 --> 2735.97
happily surprised about the yeah the

2730.42 --> 2740.05
condensed energy of it the meaning what

2735.97 --> 2742.66
I saw in him but I don't know it's just

2740.05 --> 2745.7200000000003
preliminary but hey I'm always careful

2742.66 --> 2748.27
with with people with new people like

2745.72 --> 2750.52
for example yeah very early on people

2748.27 --> 2752.83
started to forward can wheeler to me all

2750.52 --> 2754.6
the time it was like oh so impressive he

2752.83 --> 2758.83
does all this good science and

2754.6 --> 2762.88
fascinating [ __ ] and I'm like okay so I

2758.83 --> 2765.16
took a look and every time I did it just

2762.88 --> 2767.5
annoyed me the [ __ ] out of me

2765.16 --> 2770.37
because the guy is a verbal spin doctor

2767.5 --> 2773.31
he likes to overwhelm people with

2770.37 --> 2776.68
superfluous unnecessary complexed

2773.31 --> 2779.95
verbals it's like superfluous very

2776.68 --> 2785.23
superfluous he is being a wizard and on

2779.95 --> 2790.27
top of that he just he puts out all

2785.23 --> 2794.86
kinds of concepts and expects everyone

2790.27 --> 2798.19
to accept that as proven so he just goes

2794.86 --> 2800.8
presupposition on presupposition and I

2798.19 --> 2805.33
haven't seen anything really proven by

2800.8 --> 2807.46
him he showed things but I don't know I

2805.33 --> 2811.81
don't even trust him I don't even trust

2807.46 --> 2813.55
him to be honest about what he's doing

2811.81 --> 2815.41
about what he says

2813.55 --> 2817.3900000000003
he does with his setups with his

2815.41 --> 2820.89
mekinese I don't know what he does I

2817.39 --> 2820.89
just don't trust it

2833.339 --> 2839.14
yeah and I he hasn't really

2837.219 --> 2841.659
scientifically convinced me about

2839.14 --> 2843.609
anything also and I'm talking about Ken

2841.659 --> 2843.9990000000003
wheeler I don't know I don't know if

2843.609 --> 2849.399
Mackey

2843.999 --> 2854.14
max Egan is the same I don't think so

2849.399 --> 2856.899
doesn't feel the same but yeah he's not

2854.14 --> 2858.399
a guy without issues and that's I don't

2856.899 --> 2861.899
know that's visual you could see that

2858.399 --> 2865.63
and you can extrapolate that from

2861.899 --> 2873.699
everything he talks about but doesn't

2865.63 --> 2877.509
mean that it's all just delusional it's

2873.699 --> 2879.369
it could just be that he does see and

2877.509 --> 2882.579
understand things but he's getting kind

2879.369 --> 2887.859
of lost in it yeah that happens to some

2882.579 --> 2889.779
people and typically in my experience it

2887.859 --> 2892.0589999999997
typically it does happen to people that

2889.779 --> 2896.619
regularly engage in psychotropics they

2892.059 --> 2899.259
get lost again to explain get stuck in

2896.619 --> 2902.2290000000003
that in that super world in that

2899.259 --> 2905.649
oversight in that vision and you have

2902.229 --> 2909.5789999999997
more trouble getting back to earth so

2905.649 --> 2913.899
you get lost in that that happens it's

2909.579 --> 2915.969
personal it also is addictive it is a

2913.899 --> 2919.359
form of escapism in the higher realm but

2915.969 --> 2923.399
it's not it's not very productive on the

2919.359 --> 2923.399
long run anyway

2927.89 --> 2931.14
[Music]

2937.98 --> 2946.91
oh yeah talking about all your oil rigs

2940.89 --> 2950.3689999999997

2965.55 --> 2972.9900000000002
specific photo was about or a buoy yeah

2968.67 --> 2974.67

2972.99 --> 2978.6299999999997

instructions then those specific

3300.29 --> 3305.54
instructions Trump the rules for the

3302.66 --> 3308.56
time being until the situation has

3305.54 --> 3308.56
blatantly passed

3313.26 --> 3320.46
yeah Fyodor Dostoevsky I know it's a

3315.75 --> 3322.58

3458.81 --> 3461.889
[Music]

3485.86 --> 3493.77
and

3487.47 --> 3498.839
okay well Cleary is yeah that's kind of

3493.77 --> 3502.2
ridiculous but yet such an outright

3498.839 --> 3504.359
insult yeah I don't know that could

3502.2 --> 3517.89
typically get you banned I don't know

3504.359 --> 3524.49
you don't know why is who say come on

3517.89 --> 3527.27
Jose you know what happens don't don't

3524.49 --> 3527.27
be like that man

3540.8 --> 3547.36
yeah Cleary while sleeping warrior can

3543.41 --> 3547.3599999999997
get pretty foul-mouthed at times as well

3561.73 --> 3567.56
right well rocky a life look I don't

3564.98 --> 3571.79
mind giving Jose some attention you know

3567.56 --> 3576.35
he gives me some room on this channel as

3571.79 --> 3580.07
well but I just wish that if he got here

3576.35 --> 3582.98
he would actually I don't know do

3580.07 --> 3586.25
something productive instead of just

3582.98 --> 3590.96
squabbling with other people you know

3586.25 --> 3592.28
maybe get into the subjects bring some

3590.96 --> 3594.41
arguments here and there I don't know

3592.28 --> 3598.1000000000004
but yeah whatever you wants man it's

3594.41 --> 3601.04
just I don't like it when he just is

3598.1 --> 3604.88
hunting for insults for people to insult

3601.04 --> 3606.8
him and then complains about it it's you

3604.88 --> 3609.109
know it's very annoying when people do

3606.8 --> 3611.9300000000003
that it's very gamma I don't appreciate

3609.109 --> 3613.5499999999997
anyone that does that even if they would

3611.93 --> 3616.609
normally like them I just don't

3613.55 --> 3622.1000000000004
appreciate that behavior anywhere that's

3616.609 --> 3625.2799999999997
all right

3622.1 --> 3627.35
all right artherton if you really find

3625.28 --> 3630.5600000000004
him that annoying you can just block him

3627.35 --> 3632.66
and then you don't see him anymore you

3630.56 --> 3635.33
know there are certain types of ballers

3632.66 --> 3638.24
that is just so vile and negative never

3635.33 --> 3641.33
said anything productive or pure trolls

3638.24 --> 3644.5699999999997
I blocked those it's not a lot of a lot

3641.33 --> 3647.359
of them but I needed to block those or

3644.57 --> 3653.2400000000002
they would literally just stroll spam

3647.359 --> 3656.06
any chat that I got into towards me so I

3653.24 --> 3661.4489999999996
just block them

3656.06 --> 3661.449
[Music]

3664.13 --> 3667.179
[Music]

3682.53 --> 3691.599
whoa really

3686.22 --> 3705.49
okay let's see if that's real I'm don't

3691.599 --> 3707.099
know you see that hmm I don't think so

3705.49 --> 3715.359
buddy

3707.099 --> 3717.94
all right okay your thoughts oh yeah

3715.359 --> 3723.8089999999997
well you may think I'm suck but you're a

3717.94 --> 3723.809
band so I have fun with that

3741.7 --> 3747.8599999999997
yeah by the way if anybody can actually

3744.67 --> 3752.7200000000003
donate anything to my paypal I would

3747.86 --> 3756.6200000000003
appreciate it so as I said yeah right

3752.72 --> 3760.0699999999997
now it's okay but can always use more

3756.62 --> 3762.44
because yeah I'm not out of the red

3760.07 --> 3767.36
standard so I can always use a little

3762.44 --> 3771.08
bit more and every little bit helps also

3767.36 --> 3773.9300000000003
I really am constraining myself from

3771.08 --> 3776.9
typically if I have a lot from just

3773.93 --> 3778.94
spending more than I should it that's

3776.9 --> 3781.1600000000003
been a overall problem throughout my

3778.94 --> 3783.41
life not terribly it's not like I would

3781.16 --> 3788.39
literally suddenly throw a lot of money

3783.41 --> 3790.7
overboard no never that much but it's

3788.39 --> 3794.18
very easy to just get a little bit more

3790.7 --> 3796.37
comfortable and that's financially

3794.18 --> 3800.21
dangerous but I'm become very

3796.37 --> 3804.0499999999997
disciplined in relation to say 10 years

3800.21 --> 3807.29
ago about that stuff very disciplined so

3804.05 --> 3808.88
every little bit does help you don't

3807.29 --> 3811.2799999999997
have to worry that if you give me too

3808.88 --> 3813.2000000000003
much I'm suddenly all guns all gonna

3811.28 --> 3814.1000000000004
throw it overboard or something no I'm

3813.2 --> 3820.04
not gonna do that

3814.1 --> 3822.4
don't worry about that Peter just offski

3820.04 --> 3822.4
stop

3825.31 --> 3832.57
right well how about Fyodor Dostoevsky

3828.94 --> 3836.05
how about you use their wrench for

3832.57 --> 3837.9100000000003
actual moderating against wobbly

3836.05 --> 3840.1000000000004
controls that's what they're really for

3837.91 --> 3844.12
for like example that guy that I just

3840.1 --> 3846.75
bent baggy hope that's what they're for

3844.12 --> 3850.69
for people that are not really

3846.75 --> 3852.88
individuals or people that just go way

3850.69 --> 3858.43
overboard and get super disgusting like

3852.88 --> 3863.4100000000003
for example PJ would you know but yeah

3858.43 --> 3868.56
that's it's pretty people have to go

3863.41 --> 3868.56
pretty far to to really be just banned

3891.78 --> 3904.44
I really think dank yeah maybe dank is a

3901.14 --> 3907.7
bit trollee no and that's okay man

3904.44 --> 3914.13
because dank supports me all the way and

3907.7 --> 3917.58
I really appreciate that yeah you could

3914.13 --> 3921.6600000000003
technically say that dank is also a part

3917.58 --> 3924.869
of the reason why I'm here and the same

3921.66 --> 3932.21
goes for karakia life because he's been

3924.869 --> 3936.78
a wider donator in the past and see

3932.21 --> 3939.14
amanda you big supporter big moral

3936.78 --> 3939.1400000000003
support

3944.93 --> 3951.68
yeah and then there's some other

3948.07 --> 3954.8
individuals that yeah are not so active

3951.68 --> 3956.6
in chat probably because this is not a

3954.8 --> 3958.46
good time slot but they watch my show

3956.6 --> 3963.2599999999998
afterwards and they do also give me a

3958.46 --> 3964.88
regular support like for example Julie

3963.26 --> 3967.9100000000003
Bennett who has been on one of the

3964.88 --> 3970.19
earliest early bird shows just to show

3967.91 --> 3972.3199999999997
her face she was she's one of my biggest

3970.19 --> 3975.59
patreon supporters and I'm really

3972.32 --> 3979.31
thankful for it so she also definitely

3975.59 --> 3984.79
deserves a shout out and let's see

3979.31 --> 3988.33
there's some others there too let me

3984.79 --> 3988.33
just double check that

3998.34 --> 4001.53
[Music]

4002.27 --> 4005.56
how do I see this

4011.72 --> 4018.14
oh yeah Arwen young sense

4015.77 --> 4023.39
yeah he's now I'll say regular

4018.14 --> 4030.14
contributor and yes go but Dracula in

4023.39 --> 4032.54
the past but I don't know maybe I'm not

4030.14 --> 4034.5499999999997
hardcore enough really for scuba Dracula

4032.54 --> 4039.8
scuba directly is such a field guy he's

4034.55 --> 4042.53
so forward and yeah I am more of a

4039.8 --> 4044.21
talker speculator so maybe he thinks I

4042.53 --> 4046.9700000000003
don't really deserve it that much and I

4044.21 --> 4051.98
get it you know I am not really so much

4046.97 --> 4056.8689999999997
a a big flat smacker guy that constantly

4051.98 --> 4059.0
that's not really my thing I know so but

4056.869 --> 4061.19
yeah I still thank him for supporting me

4059.0 --> 4064.13
and I and I think he's a great guy like

4061.19 --> 4068.75
in person he's a he's an awesome guy he

4064.13 --> 4070.2200000000003
really is awesome that's great energy so

4068.75 --> 4071.81
yeah if you don't know about scuba

4070.22 --> 4076.6699999999996
Dracula then do check him out he has a

4071.81 --> 4080.0299999999997
channel it's called scuba Dracula and he

4076.67 --> 4081.7400000000002
does a lot of activism like on his own

4080.03 --> 4087.349
he just goes out flat smacking it's

4081.74 --> 4091.75
pretty incredible and yeah I met him at

4087.349 --> 4091.75
the Amsterdam conference last year

4096.5 --> 4103.819
okay I was a sorry but now we yeah sorry

4100.73 --> 4110.3189999999995
that that definitely deserves the time

4103.819 --> 4110.319
on you asked for it

4117.88 --> 4119.909000000001
Oh

4122.45 --> 4131.84
it's a genuine question really nah you

4129.38 --> 4134.68
don't even know the mental disability

4131.84 --> 4137.51
that you're claiming flat-earthers have

4134.68 --> 4140.6900000000005
you couldn't even name it it's just a

4137.51 --> 4143.42
word you hurt because you are a [ __ ]

4140.69 --> 4145.28
very very triggered baller that's

4143.42 --> 4148.88
probably very good at technical

4145.28 --> 4151.25
computing like a little gamma in control

4148.88 --> 4155.150000000001
of his computer realm so you can make

4151.25 --> 4158.6
socks and just say very dumb things to

4155.15 --> 4160.67
try and insult us but when tested you

4158.6 --> 4162.950000000001
don't know [ __ ] I'm pretty sure of it

4160.67 --> 4166.88
because this is the same guys as the

4162.95 --> 4171.5
other one just a total gamma [ __ ] that

4166.88 --> 4173.21
just projects his straw and [ __ ] on flat

4171.5 --> 4177.94
earthers and he doesn't he doesn't even

4173.21 --> 4177.94
know any in-depth argument I'll betcha

4207.84 --> 4229.14
anymore socks I know it's you know it's

4222.09 --> 4237.3
one individual it's one person it's one

4229.14 --> 4242.01
person many socks it's very simple see

4237.3 --> 4245.070000000001
su the second I hit his previous account

4242.01 --> 4247.05
it took him not even 30 seconds to to

4245.07 --> 4251.37
activate the other account because he

4247.05 --> 4252.84
this is a real no life troll guy has no

4251.37 --> 4254.5199999999995
arguments he's a little good at the

4252.84 --> 4255.57
technicals he's good at rolling but he

4254.52 --> 4259.5
has no life

4255.57 --> 4261.45
he has no claims though or while he has

4259.5 --> 4262.7
a lot of clay he has no evidence for

4261.45 --> 4264.8099999999995
anything he doesn't even know the

4262.7 --> 4267.54
accusations he that can't even fill in

4264.81 --> 4269.4800000000005
actual content as to accusations it's

4267.54 --> 4274.25
just gonna blatantly assert his

4269.48 --> 4276.9
projection based [ __ ] on us on me

4274.25 --> 4281.63
thinks that that's some kind of wit now

4276.9 --> 4281.629999999999
it's it's a ban it's definitely bad

4301.15 --> 4309.599999999999
oh there we have them again

4315.92 --> 4320.36
it's so funny that you mention it

4317.69 --> 4324.11
because I just happen to have a shower

4320.36 --> 4326.659
this morning and yeah there is a lid

4324.11 --> 4330.29
there is a little grease in my head it's

4326.659 --> 4332.929
called coconut fat fat I put it in there

4330.29 --> 4336.26
because well it's cold and if I don't my

4332.929 --> 4339.11
hair gets fluffy as [ __ ] and hey getting

4336.26 --> 4345.56
some coconut oil in there is actually

4339.11 --> 4347.69
good on the long run so yeah so all

4345.56 --> 4350.1990000000005
these attempts at insults are just so

4347.69 --> 4350.199
silly

4361.67 --> 4368.54
I'm not even defending myself I'm just

4365.96 --> 4372.79
dispelling the nonsense assertion any

4368.54 --> 4376.04
kind of Gama approach that other gammas

4372.79 --> 4380.3
potentially could latch on to for some

4376.04 --> 4382.78
kind of quick apparent victory and I'm

4380.3 --> 4385.610000000001
just dispelling it instantly you know

4382.78 --> 4388.91
answering the question that one thing

4385.61 --> 4393.86
ballers can never do you know that thing

4388.91 --> 4395.99
I do that I prove that I can actually

4393.86 --> 4402.259999999999
answer questions and I'm not intimidated

4395.99 --> 4405.83
by any suggestions just showing that

4402.26 --> 4407.66
like you can't do anything not really

4405.83 --> 4410.8099999999995
you're not changing my mind

4407.66 --> 4414.32
you're not even changing my mood in a

4410.81 --> 4419.75
way you're actually giving me an excuse

4414.32 --> 4424.67
to just lash out a little and keep my

4419.75 --> 4427.72
composure at the same time so I can use

4424.67 --> 4430.34
the trolls to show off a bit

4427.72 --> 4432.740000000001
isn't that just funny you know they

4430.34 --> 4434.99
think that they're accomplishing all

4432.74 --> 4437.62
this nonsense there's some kind of

4434.99 --> 4443.179999999999
secret kings or this victory

4437.62 --> 4446.15
self-perceived victory but yeah they're

4443.18 --> 4448.34
actually helping me by strengthening my

4446.15 --> 4453.129999999999
resolve and character and giving me

4448.34 --> 4453.13
opportunity to demonstrate my resolve

4459.24 --> 4468.61
so thank you trolls thank you for being

4463.78 --> 4473.7699999999995
you and it's a bit tragic though but

4468.61 --> 4479.62
yeah it is what it is they do what they

4473.77 --> 4481.96
do and who knows I don't know about most

4479.62 --> 4483.76
cameras I don't know if gamma SAR gammas

4481.96 --> 4486.94
forever I think it is pretty much a

4483.76 --> 4489.85
cursed state of being where you just

4486.94 --> 4491.29
broken and filled up with demons but

4489.85 --> 4495.160000000001
that doesn't mean that it'll be like

4491.29 --> 4501.72
that forever up to a certain degrees I

4495.16 --> 4501.72
had similar type of behavioral effects

4504.06 --> 4509.320000000001
in the past and I've worked very hard to

4507.43 --> 4512.9800000000005
try to overcome them and I think I've

4509.32 --> 4516.099999999999
pretty much succeeded I'm not quite out

4512.98 --> 4518.5
of the woods yet not entirely there's

4516.1 --> 4520.93
still big challenges that could be

4518.5 --> 4527.71
considered somewhat gamma but I do my

4520.93 --> 4530.71
freakin best and I'm serious hmm yeah

4527.71 --> 4532.63
see so I can even say like I called this

4530.71 --> 4534.58
guy gamma and I'm even just gonna say

4532.63 --> 4540.79
yeah like I'm not perfect either you

4534.58 --> 4545.2
know I had gamma traits and I indulged

4540.79 --> 4548.11
them bad behavior at times being very

4545.2 --> 4553.15
blunt roles being unnecessarily vile I

4548.11 --> 4558.66
did that but that's in the past I don't

4553.15 --> 4558.66
do that anymore i denounce that behavior

4559.17 --> 4563.22
and i designated gamma

4565.74 --> 4573.34
no no no don't worry good servant I'm

4568.39 --> 4578.22
just talking in general oh really

4573.34 --> 4581.14
I think I'm alpha do you think I'm alpha

4578.22 --> 4585.43
does my standing up make you feel like

4581.14 --> 4588.96
I'm alpha buggery boomer next role

4585.43 --> 4591.31
account took you some time this time I

4588.96 --> 4593.05
might not actually ban you right away

4591.31 --> 4595.450000000001
because this is just funny

4593.05 --> 4598.27
you think I'm alpha are you that

4595.45 --> 4602.71
impressed that's pretty cool I don't

4598.27 --> 4608.110000000001
think I'm alpha I don't know what I am I

4602.71 --> 4610.9
think I'm probably more beta or Sigma

4608.11 --> 4613.509999999999
but maybe not I don't know I've never

4610.9 --> 4615.7
thought I was an alpha if you I'm too

4613.51 --> 4619.06
weak to be an alpha but I don't know

4615.7 --> 4623.32
maybe that is part of being an alpha

4619.06 --> 4630.43
being very serious I don't know I don't

4623.32 --> 4633.34
think I'm an alpha no beta is a beta is

4630.43 --> 4636.55
not bad that's kind of a Alex Jones myth

4633.34 --> 4638.26
yeah it's Alex Jones thing he started

4636.55 --> 4640.09
the whole beta oh you gotta be alpha

4638.26 --> 4642.400000000001
well that's ridiculous in a world where

4640.09 --> 4648.64
everybody's alpha is not gonna survive

4642.4 --> 4651.19
this betas are the second in command you

4648.64 --> 4654.160000000001
could say they they have talents to

4651.19 --> 4656.65
fulfill that role to be a second up to

4654.16 --> 4658.42
be a great supporter well isn't that

4656.65 --> 4660.16
what I try to do it that's what I try to

4658.42 --> 4662.59
do with the debates and with everyone I

4660.16 --> 4667.2699999999995
always try to assist I it but still

4662.59 --> 4671.4400000000005
impress you know I do also claim some

4667.27 --> 4674.89
credit I don't know but I never thought

4671.44 --> 4678.79
it was alpha but who knows I don't know

4674.89 --> 4680.35
maybe I'm gradually becoming an alpha I

4678.79 --> 4681.88
don't freaking know you know at this

4680.35 --> 4684.7300000000005
point I don't feel I'm very alpha I

4681.88 --> 4688.81
don't even have a job I didn't I'm yeah

4684.73 --> 4690.849999999999
I have some credit here in the flattered

4688.81 --> 4693.490000000001
scene I have developed theories I've

4690.85 --> 4696.070000000001
been early with things yeah I am

4693.49 --> 4696.969
impressed even by what I put out on my

4696.07 --> 4699.759999999999
own way even though

4696.969 --> 4704.889
kind of disappointed in other fields but

4699.76 --> 4712.570000000001
oh hello Karen B you got your own

4704.889 --> 4716.499
stalkers now what are my followers well

4712.57 --> 4721.57
I don't know every individual has their

4716.499 --> 4726.28
own reason to watch this I think many of

4721.57 --> 4728.169
you are betas very good at it and I

4726.28 --> 4733.57
think that many of you are also deltas

4728.169 --> 4738.07
and in a way I sometimes feel I'm a bit

4733.57 --> 4744.518999999999
of a delta as well Delta are just very

4738.07 --> 4748.599
like purest helpers they can be very

4744.519 --> 4751.959
selfless that's I don't know Delta is

4748.599 --> 4754.51
just another type so I don't know maybe

4751.959 --> 4761.229
I'm a delta but sometimes I think yeah

4754.51 --> 4769.3
I'm probably beta but who knows I don't

4761.229 --> 4772.179
know I'd have to consult an expert and

4769.3 --> 4776.139
those terminologies like what do you

4772.179 --> 4777.55
think I am I don't know but I don't

4776.139 --> 4779.559
really feel like I'm an elf at this

4777.55 --> 4782.55
point I could maybe I can become that I

4779.559 --> 4785.400000000001
don't know I don't know how that works I

4782.55 --> 4790.269
don't know if you can really transit

4785.4 --> 4792.429
from the type it does tie into typical

4790.269 --> 4794.8
character traits and social positioning

4792.429 --> 4797.229
and people tend to not really change

4794.8 --> 4800.7390000000005
with that although I have kind of

4797.229 --> 4802.959
changed over my life so it used to be a

4800.739 --> 4805.119
lot worse so maybe I will

4802.959 --> 4810.34
I don't know what I am I'm our win

4805.119 --> 4814.32
that's what I am and even in the past I

4810.34 --> 4818.349
described myself like yeah well you know

4814.32 --> 4820.749
compared to regular people I feel like

4818.349 --> 4825.129
I'm three individuals all crammed into

4820.749 --> 4832.989
one it's just so much

4825.129 --> 4836.999
I feel very present very compacted

4832.989 --> 4840.119
individual and maybe that's more Sigma I

4836.999 --> 4840.119
don't know

4844.7 --> 4847.75
[Music]

4856.31 --> 4869.990000000001
yeah whoo whoa who are only already one

4865.14 --> 4869.990000000001
hour 20 minutes in that time is flown

4884.21 --> 4888.929
okay Amanda young

4886.05 --> 4891.78
I get it I do think it's kind of funny

4888.929 --> 4894.3
though what burglary boomer said if you

4891.78 --> 4897.539
beg for more money you were certainly

4894.3 --> 4899.519
fee Adelphi within 15 to 20 years come

4897.539 --> 4907.978999999999
on that is so silly it's kind of funny

4899.519 --> 4911.179
oh you did

4907.979 --> 4912.389
let's clear we give me some soup oh

4911.179 --> 4914.729

was just into the zone right yeah so

4949.409 --> 4955.71
peanuts Clark yeah isn't that typical

4952.099 --> 4958.650000000001
time does go fast when when we're having

4955.71 --> 4962.789
fun and despite this troll guy trying to

4958.65 --> 4965.728999999999
do is his stuff you know apparently

4962.789 --> 4968.4
still having fun just saying again Thank

4965.729 --> 4970.979
You troll for trying to get under my

4968.4 --> 4973.409
skin it's not really working but yeah

4970.979 --> 4978.5
you are a good temporary source of

4973.409 --> 4981.619
amusement so keep it coming

4978.5 --> 4981.619
[Music]

4988.309 --> 4990.9400000000005
yeah

4995.12 --> 5006.17
you know what Ryan I'm gonna give you a

4999.96 --> 5010.31
wrench don't abuse it though

5006.17 --> 5013.57
but yeah you see to be I haven't I've

5010.31 --> 5013.570000000001
seen you around for a while now

5021.489 --> 5025.94
yeah okay that was that was a good call

5024.14 --> 5036.410000000001
can be that's just that's not even

5025.94 --> 5037.099999999999
creative Larry Stephens an Omega or an

5036.41 --> 5042.05
Omega

5037.1 --> 5046.39
what is that an Omega Sigma this I don't

5042.05 --> 5046.39
even know about the Omega what is that

5048.13 --> 5056.87
am i Mark Tyler Moore could you

5053.42 --> 5062.08
elaborate on that what is it what is an

5056.87 --> 5062.08
Omega I can't recall it

5088.05 --> 5095.110000000001
right yeah but Cleary the Omega I know

5092.32 --> 5099.969
it's the alphanumeric it's the last one

5095.11 --> 5102.639
supposedly Omega said right but I don't

5099.969 --> 5105.88
know much about omegas I haven't heard

5102.639 --> 5114.34
too much elaborate talk from Owen

5105.88 --> 5119.559
Benjamin about it I think he finds

5114.34 --> 5123.719
omegas hard to define long wall variety

5119.559 --> 5131.349
of alpha really is that it is that

5123.719 --> 5135.94
correct because maybe I don't know maybe

5131.349 --> 5141.309
I am then you know my guys it does you

5135.94 --> 5143.11
know I could yeah okay okay I'd go with

5141.309 --> 5151.659000000001
that I guess if that is what that means

5143.11 --> 5154.9
then because yeah in a way like the real

5151.659 --> 5156.879999999999
alphas are really also just for the

5154.9 --> 5159.699
wider public and I don't think I ever

5156.88 --> 5162.519
will be so maybe that that makes more

5159.699 --> 5166.69
sense that I'm more getting away from

5162.519 --> 5168.400000000001
gamma and going to Omega hmm interesting

5166.69 --> 5171.299999999999
thank you thank you

5168.4 --> 5171.299999999999
that's very

5177.98 --> 5185.009999999999
but yes in a way I it makes sense

5181.37 --> 5191.01
because I do feel like an outsider I

5185.01 --> 5192.780000000001
don't hurt a lot of people don't go

5191.01 --> 5197.76
along to get along to get a wider thing

5192.78 --> 5200.28
that's more alpha and but I do still

5197.76 --> 5203.04
assert dominance I'm really still trying

5200.28 --> 5206.82
to put myself down and be persistent and

5203.04 --> 5209.04
be good and walk the path and keep on

5206.82 --> 5211.2
developing being extremely honest and

5209.04 --> 5212.76
open I don't know maybe well maybe the

5211.2 --> 5216.599999999999
extremely honest and open is not

5212.76 --> 5219.4800000000005
typically omeg I don't know so yeah I'm

5216.6 --> 5225.450000000001
are wind mostly it is a personal choice

5219.48 --> 5229.7699999999995
but maybe yeah maybe that makes sense

5225.45 --> 5232.98
maybe I am an America I don't know it

5229.77 --> 5236.1900000000005
could be I wouldn't mind being declared

5232.98 --> 5239.54
in Omega I am NOT the Alpha and the

5236.19 --> 5239.54
Omega that is blasphemy

5247.42 --> 5252.67
[Music]

5257.67 --> 5265.65
all right well thank you Mary Tyler

5260.26 --> 5265.650000000001
Moore for the party info

5280.809 --> 5287.71
but anyway look it doesn't really matter

5285.099 --> 5291.46
what would be the best I just want to be

5287.71 --> 5294.28
sized up properly really that's really

5291.46 --> 5297.7300000000005
what I want so I'm not trying to claim

5294.28 --> 5300.789
some kind of character status through

5297.73 --> 5303.25
this you know hey I could turn out to be

5300.789 --> 5305.759999999999
a delta I don't know I don't know I'd

5303.25 --> 5308.8
need to ask some people that really are

5305.76 --> 5311.8
very sharp and on the details with this

5308.8 --> 5317.070000000001
kind of sizing up of character so I'm

5311.8 --> 5317.070000000001
not sure but hey Omega sounds good to me

5340.099 --> 5345.619000000001
hmmm interesting more colored tralfaz

5343.639 --> 5349.369
have no need to push their chest out and

5345.619 --> 5350.38
act off right so they fall naturally in

5349.369 --> 5353.48
control

5350.38 --> 5357.7390000000005
yeah well that's certainly something

5353.48 --> 5362.419999999999
that I well you could say hunger for in

5357.739 --> 5365.959999999999
a way for that natural momentum and I've

5362.42 --> 5373.9400000000005
had most some moments in the past and

5365.96 --> 5378.349
far past but I don't know it's it's only

5373.94 --> 5380.48
been real just moments and even after

5378.349 --> 5383.900000000001
what it's it's kind of addictive when

5380.48 --> 5385.19
that happens it was for me and yeah when

5383.9 --> 5390.409
you get obsessed with it then you lose

5385.19 --> 5393.678999999999
it I don't know but maybe I can get some

5390.409 --> 5395.9
of that back I want to and I also want

5393.679 --> 5399.889
to be very careful that if I succeed

5395.9 --> 5405.199
that I'll not drop the ball of energy as

5399.889 --> 5411.849
where I persisted no maybe you just need

5405.199 --> 5411.848999999999
to get banned because this is my job

5413.73 --> 5426.049999999999
and hey I got I got some funds now so

5418.79 --> 5426.05
crisis availed at least for now

5449.769 --> 5455.320000000001
all right Mary Tyler Moore thanks for

5452.679 --> 5457.179
for coming by you're always welcome in

5455.32 --> 5466.48
my chat you sound like a very nice woman

5457.179 --> 5469.389
and yeah I definitely understand why

5466.48 --> 5474.598999999999
some people would typically avoid these

5469.389 --> 5474.599
chats it gets very rowdy sometimes it's

5478.079 --> 5482.79
I try to keep it under control but it's

5480.84 --> 5484.53
sometimes it when it just happens it

5482.79 --> 5486.659
happens and they can do very little to

5484.53 --> 5491.78
stop the the back and forth and the

5486.659 --> 5491.78
rowdiness try though

5507.38 --> 5514.900000000001
hmm oh it just got a little less toxic

5512.51 --> 5514.900000000001
in here

5525.269 --> 5529.909000000001
please take your toxicity somewhere else

5546.44 --> 5549.7699999999995
[Music]

5552.44 --> 5557.849999999999
isn't it funny though how easy it is to

5555.719 --> 5559.92
spot them I don't know if you guys are

5557.85 --> 5564.0
having difficulty to spot it out but I

5559.92 --> 5567.21
just see this instantly and it's so

5564.0 --> 5569.16
funny because you can very much read in

5567.21 --> 5572.01
what they're trying and it's just so

5569.16 --> 5574.199
desperate any angle anything any kind of

5572.01 --> 5576.42
entrance they're just so desperate to

5574.199 --> 5579.66
get in somehow get it under the skin in

5576.42 --> 5583.68
some way any way any way they can think

5579.66 --> 5586.01
of it's not working why don't you go do

5583.68 --> 5589.35
something more productive with your life

5586.01 --> 5591.570000000001
instead of getting under trying and not

5589.35 --> 5595.320000000001
succeeding in getting under the skin of

5591.57 --> 5598.349999999999
some youtuber guy that apparently you

5595.32 --> 5599.099999999999
don't like very much because it's not

5598.35 --> 5600.9890000000005
working

5599.1 --> 5603.360000000001
you're not deterring me from continuing

5600.989 --> 5603.98
you're actually helping me out with this

5603.36 --> 5606.87
nonsense

5603.98 --> 5609.78
by giving me something to talk about and

5606.87 --> 5617.64
show that I am very confident and what I

5609.78 --> 5620.639999999999
do haha I like that Ryan

5617.64 --> 5623.820000000001
artherton yes it is how it feels to me

5620.64 --> 5626.900000000001
it's the scope I can do that with people

5623.82 --> 5629.639999999999
it is it seems like it's a an ability

5626.9 --> 5631.889999999999
that's routed into a theory on this and

5629.64 --> 5635.01
I can do it and I have been doing that

5631.89 --> 5637.05
for a very long time and you know how it

5635.01 --> 5639.6900000000005
goes I'm just sitting there then

5637.05 --> 5642.360000000001
suddenly it's like it's very similar to

5639.69 --> 5645.389999999999
like people getting triggered but it's

5642.36 --> 5647.82
not really just subtly the energy output

5645.39 --> 5650.13
from me palpably from people that can

5647.82 --> 5652.469
hear me or see be in chat the way I type

5650.13 --> 5653.37
I know people can feel this certainly

5652.469 --> 5656.79
yeah

5653.37 --> 5659.43
I just out my energy intensity becomes

5656.79 --> 5662.01
like three times and then so they just

5659.43 --> 5666.14
back back back back back back back back

5662.01 --> 5667.320000000001
super condensed super to the point

5666.14 --> 5670.650000000001
criticism

5667.32 --> 5672.8099999999995
detail put in hilarious funny and

5670.65 --> 5675.409
potentially mean anyway and that's what

5672.81 --> 5678.96
I do that's what I can do

5675.409 --> 5682.71
and it does feel a bit like magic when I

5678.96 --> 5684.9
do it and I can't do it constantly it

5682.71 --> 5688.199
does take up some energy but it tends to

5684.9 --> 5690.388999999999
be very effective and leave an imprint

5688.199 --> 5693.54
when I do it so it is an energy

5690.389 --> 5696.139
efficiency thing also for me to function

5693.54 --> 5696.139
like this

5704.67 --> 5717.55
okay what Jane perfu I watch your show

5715.0 --> 5721.89
and play chess for twice the inlet

5717.55 --> 5729.88
intellectual stimulation really that's

5721.89 --> 5732.400000000001
well I'm honored oh and by the way I'm

5729.88 --> 5735.42
not really a great chess player I'm an

5732.4 --> 5740.19
intuitive chess player and I kind of

5735.42 --> 5742.9
refuse to learn the broader tactics I I

5740.19 --> 5747.28
specifically like it's a personal liking

5742.9 --> 5748.8099999999995
the purely let my because it's a game

5747.28 --> 5751.24
anyway it's not really gonna matter you

5748.81 --> 5753.370000000001
know to not memorize [ __ ] become

5751.24 --> 5756.599999999999
mechanical but to let my intuition

5753.37 --> 5758.5599999999995
figure things out like a an on the spot

5756.6 --> 5760.84
improvisation every single time and I do

5758.56 --> 5765.1
remember the rules of the chess pieces

5760.84 --> 5767.83
and all that and I have seen how typical

5765.1 --> 5770.200000000001
situations can end up and then I kind of

5767.83 --> 5772.96
my intuition extrapolate from that and

5770.2 --> 5776.38
that's how I play chess it's super

5772.96 --> 5778.96
intuitive but I'm not super good at it

5776.38 --> 5781.0
though I haven't really played enough

5778.96 --> 5787.75
chess in my life to be extremely good at

5781.0 --> 5794.4
it but I can and I can't get into it it

5787.75 --> 5794.4
seems important to me or worth my time

5804.9 --> 5812.91
but yeah just really only works with two

5808.59 --> 5818.3
players chess against the computers not

5812.91 --> 5822.54
thing for me like for games like that I

5818.3 --> 5827.49
really need physical people to be in

5822.54 --> 5830.34
front of me somewhere because I size up

5827.49 --> 5833.25
their essence to let my intuition tell

5830.34 --> 5835.89
me where their intuition is taking them

5833.25 --> 5837.72
and what their approach is I'm almost

5835.89 --> 5840.06
more interested into the in the

5837.72 --> 5844.5
psychology of the very complex process

5840.06 --> 5854.7300000000005
behind chess decision-making rather than

5844.5 --> 5859.95
the actual chess game and I used to do

5854.73 --> 5862.349999999999
that with like like more mechanical

5859.95 --> 5864.48
computer games like in the direction of

5862.35 --> 5867.0
racing games where you literally have to

5864.48 --> 5869.37
do something reflex based and if you're

5867.0 --> 5871.95
there next to somebody I could really

5869.37 --> 5873.96
use that every diet in any way I could

5871.95 --> 5875.55
also use it to annoy them to get them

5873.96 --> 5878.52
off balance it's not very nice thing to

5875.55 --> 5882.03
do we can do all kinds of things just

5878.52 --> 5887.9400000000005
with the physical presence of somebody

5882.03 --> 5892.04
else engaging in the same process and I

5887.94 --> 5897.2
don't know maybe that's a beta thing

5892.04 --> 5903.69
like I can be a really good assistant

5897.2 --> 5906.9
like really good and like I have

5903.69 --> 5909.2699999999995
assisted people in things that I have

5906.9 --> 5912.87
never even known about and I would just

5909.27 --> 5915.6900000000005
figure out a lot and I would yeah my

5912.87 --> 5919.05
intuition would even already figure

5915.69 --> 5921.299999999999
things out for me without yeah the guy

5919.05 --> 5922.860000000001
the expert having to tell me and I would

5921.3 --> 5929.31
just figure it out I love it

5922.86 --> 5932.239
I'm a great assistant I think but yeah

5929.31 --> 5935.150000000001
you have to want it

5932.239 --> 5937.009999999999
because not everybody wants good advice

5935.15 --> 5938.57
all the time because some people just

5937.01 --> 5942.77
want to figure it out themselves and

5938.57 --> 5944.42
they want the credit also and yeah you

5942.77 --> 5945.080000000001
do learn the most by doing things

5944.42 --> 5947.27
yourself

5945.08 --> 5952.07
so always getting assistance actually

5947.27 --> 5956.18
can detract you don't forget that

5952.07 --> 5958.46
constantly but it can also help you yeah

5956.18 --> 5961.01
basically overcome certain obstacles

5958.46 --> 5962.9
pretty early on if you can catch on to

5961.01 --> 5965.81
the level of the person explaining

5962.9 --> 5967.46
things to you but yeah not always that

5965.81 --> 5972.650000000001
you know I'm not gonna out expert an

5967.46 --> 5974.81
expert when it comes to technical things

5972.65 --> 5977.239
that doesn't happen very often because

5974.81 --> 5979.370000000001
most technical jobs are just knowing a

5977.239 --> 5983.259999999999
lot of things a lot of tricks and

5979.37 --> 5985.489
intricate things and connecting them all

5983.26 --> 5986.9890000000005
yeah and if you don't know about all

5985.489 --> 5988.839999999999
those things it's you're never gonna

5986.989 --> 5991.58
even with intuition you're never gonna

5988.84 --> 5995.66
get it all right because your your

5991.58 --> 5999.2
knowledge is incomplete but anyway it's

5995.66 --> 6003.67
getting bit meta but I always like

5999.2 --> 6006.849999999999
assisting it's like even if somebody had

6003.67 --> 6010.3
a job they had to do or a window cleaner

6006.85 --> 6012.219
or anything I am always fascinated with

6010.3 --> 6013.21
like how are they doing it how are they

6012.219 --> 6015.37
being efficient

6013.21 --> 6017.05
what are they dealing with do they have

6015.37 --> 6019.239
emotional things they're dealing with

6017.05 --> 6020.68
while they're doing their job how well

6019.239 --> 6026.739
is it working for them I don't know it's

6020.68 --> 6028.780000000001
just and I like when somebody for

6026.739 --> 6030.879999999999
example an electrician is somewhere I'd

6028.78 --> 6032.8
like to assist them also to figure out

6030.88 --> 6034.45
what they're doing so that I might pick

6032.8 --> 6037.87
up something from it and could

6034.45 --> 6039.73
potentially if really no other way there

6037.87 --> 6043.3
was no other way that I could do

6039.73 --> 6046.9
something like that myself yeah I guess

6043.3 --> 6049.95
it's called the game of life you know a

6046.9 --> 6049.95
lot of people do that

6054.77 --> 6059.1900000000005
and for me one of the best ways to learn

6057.51 --> 6062.0
is from other people is the full

6059.19 --> 6067.41
spectrum is the personal full spectrum

6062.0 --> 6071.18
because everything else helps you like

6067.41 --> 6071.18
silence okay let me help you with that

6098.069 --> 6111.049
I think he's tiring out he's getting

6104.969 --> 6111.049
slower and slower with with his sucks

6126.35 --> 6132.02
although oh he might have actually asked

6129.53 --> 6136.04
a halfway-decent question which he

6132.02 --> 6138.26
thinks cannot be answered my back had

6136.04 --> 6140.24
spent like the last fifty minutes of the

6138.26 --> 6141.92
show just answering that before I start

6140.24 --> 6143.54
sending in new trolls to do the same

6141.92 --> 6145.67
thing because he might think he's

6143.54 --> 6148.13
actually onto something which are not

6145.67 --> 6151.63
because we've had these trolls asking

6148.13 --> 6155.54
exactly this question for five years and

6151.63 --> 6158.21
have been able to answer it every single

6155.54 --> 6160.64
time elaborately and more elaborately

6158.21 --> 6163.19
over the years even so let me just

6160.64 --> 6166.01
answer the question why would they lie

6163.19 --> 6166.929999999999
about the shape of the earth why would

6166.01 --> 6171.17
they do that

6166.93 --> 6173.3
hi can anybody else give me some input

6171.17 --> 6176.39
on why why would they lie about the

6173.3 --> 6178.85
shape of the earth could it perhaps have

6176.39 --> 6184.64
something to do with if you control

6178.85 --> 6187.52
information you control the people if

6184.64 --> 6190.25
what they believe is the story you tell

6187.52 --> 6193.370000000001
them well you know what is real and can

6190.25 --> 6200.0
use that against them because they don't

6193.37 --> 6202.58
know it perhaps and maybe one of those

6200.0 --> 6205.49
things is making huge amount of money

6202.58 --> 6208.28
because people just stuck in the

6205.49 --> 6210.32
specific narrated lie and all the

6208.28 --> 6214.37
mechanics that are put on top of that

6210.32 --> 6216.679999999999
are very desperate that somehow try and

6214.37 --> 6218.18
keep up holding that light to themselves

6216.68 --> 6220.79
because they love it they love the

6218.18 --> 6224.450000000001
fantasy of it all that's injected with

6220.79 --> 6227.03
that that's part of it it's a dream so

6224.45 --> 6230.78
yeah then there can be a lot of people

6227.03 --> 6235.88
if they want help fool them with story

6230.78 --> 6238.16
time and maybe visuals and yeah like oh

6235.88 --> 6240.35
we're going to space and then yeah guess

6238.16 --> 6242.95
what happens huge amount of money is

6240.35 --> 6246.530000000001
smack down because those people are very

6242.95 --> 6252.73
desperate to somehow reinforce all that

6246.53 --> 6255.74
lovely illusion and it's very tough

6252.73 --> 6258.2
apparently because yeah people that do

6255.74 --> 6259.87
that do the real thing the Space Age

6258.2 --> 6262.15
then you require a lot of money

6259.87 --> 6264.25
hey if you believe that that's so real

6262.15 --> 6267.4
then yeah you would go with that it will

6264.25 --> 6269.8
cost a lot of money so if you really

6267.4 --> 6272.44
love it you'll donate to that and that's

6269.8 --> 6274.150000000001
how it works so that's why they lie

6272.44 --> 6277.78
about the shape of the earth to give you

6274.15 --> 6280.21
a lie about it that can get them a lot

6277.78 --> 6282.82
of money and people are willing to pay

6280.21 --> 6286.4800000000005
that because they believe the story is

6282.82 --> 6288.4
real and want more but because they

6286.48 --> 6290.62
believe it is real they don't realize

6288.4 --> 6292.2699999999995
it's just a story that can basically be

6290.62 --> 6295.18
generated for free and maybe some easy

6292.27 --> 6297.280000000001
visuals or whatever now they believe

6295.18 --> 6299.92
it's real so they will put down a lot of

6297.28 --> 6303.849999999999
money because they think its development

6299.92 --> 6307.42
its progress they don't they can't get

6303.85 --> 6314.5
there so that's the reason it's very

6307.42 --> 6318.07
summarized our satellite building job

6314.5 --> 6321.97
programs all all part of becoming part

6318.07 --> 6324.04
of the dream that amazing story that

6321.97 --> 6325.860000000001
it's all just fantastical and we're

6324.04 --> 6330.55
going to space and we're gonna all be

6325.86 --> 6332.83
teleporters and sci-fi stuff people want

6330.55 --> 6338.41
that people want to sci-fi people want

6332.83 --> 6341.35
e-o getting over poverty and war which

6338.41 --> 6345.25
is typically a part of the science

6341.35 --> 6348.43
fiction set up like the the supposed

6345.25 --> 6350.38
antecedent in order for us to escape the

6348.43 --> 6353.47
planet is to have a one-world government

6350.38 --> 6357.79
so we can properly represent ourselves

6353.47 --> 6361.09
towards the entire universe yeah so

6357.79 --> 6365.56
people will want that they want that

6361.09 --> 6368.860000000001
fantasy of that we're all all past all

6365.56 --> 6371.02
that human problematics prowl past that

6368.86 --> 6375.91
now we can get past that just donate

6371.02 --> 6381.13
your time or your money or your heart to

6375.91 --> 6384.7
the dream and help the people that help

6381.13 --> 6389.71
you with that make huge record amounts

6384.7 --> 6391.57
of money and a bit of income and comfort

6389.71 --> 6394.7
on top of that

6391.57 --> 6395.45
so yeah that's that that answers that

6394.7 --> 6398.74
question

6395.45 --> 6398.74
and it only took me five minutes

6415.69 --> 6426.009999999999
dick I would have been a great Royal

6421.06 --> 6427.780000000001
Marine what what is that you think I

6426.01 --> 6438.780000000001
would be great in the military are you

6427.78 --> 6438.78
serious I don't know

6444.079 --> 6449.63
well at some point I could there was

6447.139 --> 6451.01
there's like a voluntary draft or there

6449.63 --> 6452.869
used to be at least I don't know if it's

6451.01 --> 6454.969
still there in the Netherlands and I

6452.869 --> 6457.82
actually did thought like maybe I should

6454.969 --> 6461.29
do it but I was too scared it's a

6457.82 --> 6468.009999999999
new--it's war is always wrong i heavily

6461.29 --> 6468.01
oversimplified it when I was 18 but I

6468.52 --> 6475.969
don't know military doesn't seem like a

6472.07 --> 6480.079
great place to me too many too many

6475.969 --> 6480.71
rules too little room are we giving the

6480.079 --> 6483.5
orders

6480.71 --> 6487.79
really you think that giving orders in

6483.5 --> 6490.07
military is so great well I don't know I

6487.79 --> 6492.53
don't know if I would for example want

6490.07 --> 6494.619
to be an order giver and potentially at

6492.53 --> 6497.599
some point be responsible to sending

6494.619 --> 6500.2699999999995
loads of people and it might have gotten

6497.599 --> 6502.13
to know and actually found good and nice

6500.27 --> 6504.02
people to send them to their deaths for

6502.13 --> 6507.5
example you think that's something

6504.02 --> 6511.2390000000005
that's that's cool I think the military

6507.5 --> 6511.239
is cool I don't know

6517.6 --> 6524.6900000000005
you know in a way I have a defensive

6521.99 --> 6526.4
feel like in a sense that I want to

6524.69 --> 6529.0
protect my environment I want to protect

6526.4 --> 6532.04
the innocent and other people I want to

6529.0 --> 6535.94
fight the corruptness and sprint spread

6532.04 --> 6539.2699999999995
the light fight the corruption spread

6535.94 --> 6542.54
the light and hey if there was some kind

6539.27 --> 6547.67
of military situation going on and it

6542.54 --> 6549.92
was getting like it was essential like

6547.67 --> 6553.1
for our everyone survival then yeah I

6549.92 --> 6555.4400000000005
might actually not hide in a corner and

6553.1 --> 6557.450000000001
actually forward myself like okay yeah I

6555.44 --> 6560.259999999999
might get killed but I got to do

6557.45 --> 6563.24
something I got to help out

6560.26 --> 6565.97
yeah if it gets that bad yeah I I

6563.24 --> 6568.8099999999995
probably would I would just feel so

6565.97 --> 6575.96
incredibly misery miserable if I didn't

6568.81 --> 6578.84
you know but in this world right now is

6575.96 --> 6581.3
the way things work with all the all the

6578.84 --> 6583.610000000001
the systems in place and all the the

6581.3 --> 6590.570000000001
political decision-making and just these

6583.61 --> 6592.79
bad setups I don't really think that

6590.57 --> 6596.17
being a military would be all that great

6592.79 --> 6596.17
you know and

6599.82 --> 6605.3099999999995
I just can't imagine you're being part

6602.34 --> 6607.95
of military and then suddenly you just

6605.31 --> 6610.68
noticed that politics is literally

6607.95 --> 6614.5199999999995
forwarding like [ __ ] very bleep

6610.68 --> 6617.04
conspiracy lying nonsense and then use

6614.52 --> 6620.31
that as a foundation for years to come

6617.04 --> 6623.37
to send out military to certain

6620.31 --> 6626.490000000001
locations like your this happened that

6623.37 --> 6629.49
is the enemy so we must fight them even

6626.49 --> 6631.95
though it was a lie well that sucks if

6629.49 --> 6634.23
you're suddenly potentially a a dupe

6631.95 --> 6639.48
part of a dubious force that's driven by

6634.23 --> 6643.3099999999995
lies I die I wouldn't want to be that

6639.48 --> 6643.3099999999995
person that's soldier

6652.17 --> 6656.76
oh so weather just switch you're on big

6655.83 --> 6662.24
time look at that

6656.76 --> 6668.31
the cloud there's some rain as well man

6662.24 --> 6670.92
just got cloudy in here what the

6668.31 --> 6674.43
beautiful weather was nice while it

6670.92 --> 6678.39
lasted maybe end of it they still season

6674.43 --> 6682.02
blue over there just a big cloud coming

6678.39 --> 6684.2300000000005
over I noticed by the the light dropping

6682.02 --> 6684.2300000000005
away

6708.17 --> 6711.17
yeah

6719.63 --> 6726.2300000000005
Oh michael roark patriots and turns into

6722.36 --> 6728.589999999999
terrorism when a hostile force has taken

6726.23 --> 6728.589999999999
over the country

6740.449 --> 6746.678999999999
or rather not when didn't because it it

6743.84 --> 6750.05
would be the revealing of that aspect

6746.679 --> 6754.0
that there is a hostile force basically

6750.05 --> 6754.0
having taken over that would go there

6762.139 --> 6770.4800000000005
what the hell what are you talking about

6765.619 --> 6773.78
Janne curfew the flat earth war be just

6770.48 --> 6777.83
around the corner what what flare the

6773.78 --> 6780.44
war you mean the the bickering online

6777.83 --> 6784.1
well that's Wars been raging for five

6780.44 --> 6787.129999999999
years now but I don't I don't see any

6784.1 --> 6790.219
physical battle you know most of these

6787.13 --> 6793.67
gammas most of the opponents we face are

6790.219 --> 6795.53
all a bunch of gammas do you think

6793.67 --> 6802.1900000000005
they'd go into a physical fight no

6795.53 --> 6804.08
they're all [ __ ] cowards it's bit of

6802.19 --> 6809.509999999999
an overgeneralization but that's pretty

6804.08 --> 6811.159
much the gist of it pretty sure you know

6809.51 --> 6814.070000000001
and hey there may still be some like

6811.159 --> 6815.78
military guys out there that don't like

6814.07 --> 6817.429
it that don't like flat earth that's

6815.78 --> 6820.73
because they really love the space

6817.429 --> 6823.4890000000005
stories and they may be competent but

6820.73 --> 6826.699
yeah if they're soldiers do you think

6823.489 --> 6828.428999999999
they're gonna abuse their their training

6826.699 --> 6833.65
and their abilities to basically

6828.429 --> 6837.409
terrorist assault a group of people with

6833.65 --> 6842.619
with different convictions I don't think

6837.409 --> 6842.619
so that would be completely insane I

6843.04 --> 6849.32
don't think there's ever going to be any

6845.3 --> 6851.6900000000005
actual physical conflict like that on a

6849.32 --> 6853.699
wider scale you know maybe the hustles

6851.69 --> 6856.879999999999
or brawls or whatever it was between

6853.699 --> 6860.509999999999
individuals but that's probably gonna be

6856.88 --> 6863.84
more personal oriented you know some

6860.51 --> 6866.63
people can get into fight entanglements

6863.84 --> 6868.25
over this stuff like a certain baller

6866.63 --> 6870.79
I'm not pointing at any specific

6868.25 --> 6873.92
individuals it's just a general set up

6870.79 --> 6875.84
so certain type of baller gets really

6873.92 --> 6877.55
pissed off at a flat earther that flat

6875.84 --> 6880.369000000001
earther gets really pissed off at the

6877.55 --> 6882.139
baller they constantly bicker they over

6880.369 --> 6885.44
the year start to develop a real hatred

6882.139 --> 6888.619
for one another well yeah then some

6885.44 --> 6890.0
point if they meet or like one guy

6888.619 --> 6891.71
thinks oh I'm gonna face him now

6890.0 --> 6893.599
whatever gonna make a stand of it yeah

6891.71 --> 6895.519
they might actually

6893.599 --> 6897.649
get into a physical brawl at some point

6895.519 --> 6900.649
but that's gonna be personal it's not

6897.649 --> 6904.309
gonna be because of Flat Earth Club it's

6900.649 --> 6906.709000000001
gonna be because they developed a

6904.309 --> 6909.429
personal beef with one another so that's

6906.709 --> 6909.429
my view on that

6923.09 --> 6929.57
really well you just show me which

6927.17 --> 6932.18
profits have been killed okay hey if

6929.57 --> 6934.009999999999
people are suddenly getting killed yeah

6932.18 --> 6935.84
that's gonna have an impact and then

6934.01 --> 6938.8
we're gonna have to resize up the whole

6935.84 --> 6944.24
situation but I don't see anybody

6938.8 --> 6946.76
getting killed do you know anyone I

6944.24 --> 6951.92
don't they may be people that died of

6946.76 --> 6955.13
disease or whatever or you know who

6951.92 --> 6957.74
knows somebody may actually just go like

6955.13 --> 6960.77
crash and suicide or whatever that could

6957.74 --> 6961.73
happen I don't know I'm not me by the

6960.77 --> 6965.4800000000005
way never

6961.73 --> 6967.91
I'd be tortured to death before I would

6965.48 --> 6968.5599999999995
consider suicide it's just never gonna

6967.91 --> 6973.91
happen

6968.56 --> 6975.59
but yeah who knows you know it is very

6973.91 --> 6977.18
stressful some people may roll into it

6975.59 --> 6978.77
and they just turn out that they can't

6977.18 --> 6981.17
handle it and then they explode it could

6978.77 --> 6985.43
happen but it hasn't really happened so

6981.17 --> 6988.76
far so I don't see it I just don't see

6985.43 --> 6990.89
this physical war I think it is I think

6988.76 --> 6993.38
it is fair for addiction guys I think

6990.89 --> 6995.93
you're literally trying to recreate the

6993.38 --> 6998.6900000000005
fear porn that you're you have been used

6995.93 --> 7000.76
to and you're just recreating it because

6998.69 --> 7002.589999999999
you kind of need that fear to keep you

7000.76 --> 7004.29
going to keep you fascinated I don't

7002.59 --> 7008.32
think it's real

7004.29 --> 7011.55
I'm not saying yeah true I think it's a

7008.32 --> 7011.549999999999
mistake really

7020.289 --> 7026.289
yeah but people create their own fear

7023.559 --> 7029.53
porn once you get fear porn addiction

7026.289 --> 7031.509999999999
and almost everybody to some degrees has

7029.53 --> 7033.19
it because you've really Taoist in it

7031.51 --> 7037.389
everywhere it's the new way of thinking

7033.19 --> 7039.308999999999
almost just injected in everything so if

7037.389 --> 7042.42
you're used to it that means you're also

7039.309 --> 7044.829000000001
become like physiologically dependent on

7042.42 --> 7049.599
what it does to you

7044.829 --> 7051.579
and if you then realize mentally like oh

7049.599 --> 7053.769
wait that's all known since the

7051.579 --> 7058.299999999999
meteorite shares own onset climate

7053.769 --> 7063.159000000001
changes all nonsense you know that stuff

7058.3 --> 7064.2300000000005
is [ __ ] alien invasion [ __ ] but yes

7063.159 --> 7066.19
you're still gonna have the

7064.23 --> 7067.718999999999
physiological side effects so what

7066.19 --> 7071.018999999999
people then tend to do and this is a

7067.719 --> 7074.59
mechanism of the mind okay this is when

7071.019 --> 7078.659000000001
the mind becomes utilized by your ego by

7074.59 --> 7082.78
your hunger by your lust instead of

7078.659 --> 7087.73
instead of letting it go as it were

7082.78 --> 7091.0
people then create their own new fear

7087.73 --> 7094.089999999999
porn in something they're doing to

7091.0 --> 7096.219
create some kind of heavy outcome
