yesterday from the package

196.459 --> 202.31900000000002
uh I ended up eating it all

and that was a bit weird because I'm not

202.319 --> 206.879
used to Chocolate anymore I mean I

204.0 --> 209.099
didn't get sick from it but

206.879 --> 211.62

240.959 --> 244.44

242.459 --> 249.48
chocolate it felt kind of healthy it had

244.44 --> 251.76
like raw pieces in it as well so yeah

249.48 --> 254.64
it was a good sort of chocolate but I'm

385.319 --> 392.78000000000003

393.89 --> 396.95
[Music]

399.72 --> 402.68
right anyway

403.319 --> 406.88
what have you guys been up to

416.039 --> 421.58
I've been kind of gaming yesterday night

419.1 --> 421.58000000000004
I think

442.02 --> 448.02
I remember watching Jim Bob

445.62 --> 451.52
oh yeah caught up on some Ro and

448.02 --> 451.52
Benjamin also I think yeah

454.5 --> 460.38
because yeah Owen had this hilarious

458.4 --> 463.31899999999996
rant

460.38 --> 464.94
a roasting of Jim Bob I don't know if

463.319 --> 468.08000000000004
anybody's checked that out but that was

464.94 --> 468.08
freaking hilarious

470.759 --> 475.819
because Jim Bob made a really rude joke

476.3 --> 482.34000000000003
who let the dogs out and oh Benjamin

479.58 --> 485.21999999999997
thought that deserved a proper roasting

482.34 --> 486.96
response and it was amazing so like 23

485.22 --> 489.68
minutes

486.96 --> 489.68
pretty cool

492.599 --> 495.44

Patricia stair documentary

523.2 --> 528.3000000000001

526.38 --> 530.6

528.3 --> 530.5999999999999
yesterday

531.48 --> 536.82
not sure it was him but yeah that was

534.54 --> 538.52

[Music]

542.04 --> 546.18
thank you

543.48 --> 547.04

571.03 --> 576.92
[Music]

573.74 --> 576.92
for what

581.18 --> 586.019
like in relation to what situation that

584.519 --> 588.98
he was talking about

586.019 --> 588.98
that's interesting

590.17 --> 595.78
[Music]

603.03 --> 613.04
[Music]

610.92 --> 616.019

663.45 --> 668.269
[Music]

674.22 --> 677.22
okay

677.519 --> 685.44
okay if you can see that

681.12 --> 687.779
that's that's very typical though

685.44 --> 688.86
so he was praising him but he tried to

687.779 --> 692.7
get him on

688.86 --> 694.92
he that that's what yeah

692.7 --> 698.1600000000001
I mean that could just swing around to

694.92 --> 700.86
the other side very easily depending on

698.16 --> 703.3199999999999
whatever happened so

700.86 --> 706.57
okay that that does sound typical

703.32 --> 706.57
[Music]

710.76 --> 713.24
no

715.019 --> 720.36
like was it just him

demonstration

836.94 --> 842.7790000000001
like are against the war which is

839.399 --> 842.779
extremely sensible of course

845.519 --> 852.32
but uh yeah that's happening apparently

849.0 --> 852.32
somewhere in November

873.18 --> 876.019
foreign

878.91 --> 897.42
[Music]

940.56 --> 946.4399999999999
that he isn't commenting in my chat

because his YouTube account was banned

946.44 --> 960.139
[Music]

956.519 --> 960.139

961.08 --> 972.32
[Music]

969.72 --> 972.32
foreign

993.48 --> 998.24
but also I chose not to title it

998.519 --> 1002.199

1029.6 --> 1036.52

1073.06 --> 1076.1799999999998
[Music]

1079.24 --> 1084.22
not sure if it's raining right now but

1084.679 --> 1088.539
it's very wet to say at least

1095.24 --> 1097.78
ah

1098.299 --> 1100.48
thank you

1106.81 --> 1114.5
[Music]

1112.52 --> 1117.22
I think I was doing a lot of dream

1114.5 --> 1117.22
walking yesterday

1117.44 --> 1121.1000000000001
because there was just there was so much

1119.419 --> 1124.2800000000002
energy because of all that bright sun

1121.1 --> 1127.539
which really persisted

1124.28 --> 1127.539
until sundown

1127.76 --> 1133.64
and I really enjoyed that a lot it felt

1131.419 --> 1137.38
great

1133.64 --> 1140.0
and the evening I was just dream walking

1137.38 --> 1143.0590000000002
like fractal thinking thinking about

1140.0 --> 1145.64
like mortality and

1143.059 --> 1148.52
what actually happens

1145.64 --> 1151.46
afterward like in a mechanism right

1148.52 --> 1153.44
based on things that I'd seen also

1151.46 --> 1156.1000000000001
through visions and just like

1153.44 --> 1156.1000000000001
and then

1157.52 --> 1163.16
actually using that as a blueprint to

1161.299 --> 1166.16
cross-reference everything that's

1163.16 --> 1168.74
happening as in every old people's lives

1166.16 --> 1169.8200000000002
and like all people live and then they

1168.74 --> 1172.76
die

1169.82 --> 1174.74
and then going by the premise that there

1172.76 --> 1177.2
is something happening in the

1174.74 --> 1181.4
continuation

1177.2 --> 1183.559
that might actually be a trickle

1181.4 --> 1187.3400000000001
to the whole thing working and just

1183.559 --> 1188.66
puzzling with that I guess it's kind of

1187.34 --> 1191.84
just

1188.66 --> 1195.26
a bit science fictiony

1191.84 --> 1197.48
and still all very fluid I'm just trying

1195.26 --> 1200.419
to figure out a complete oversight of

1197.48 --> 1203.14
what is going on for real including

1200.419 --> 1203.14
afterlife

1204.38 --> 1208.179
because if that is there

1208.22 --> 1213.32
then it is also intricately linked to

1210.86 --> 1217.52
the design right it's it's kind of

1213.32 --> 1221.559
approaching it from the same angle as

1217.52 --> 1225.5
all our dreams are derived from physical

1221.559 --> 1229.82
interaction based experiences

1225.5 --> 1231.559
like everything we see hair smell

1229.82 --> 1235.1599999999999
touch

1231.559 --> 1238.76
and even emotionally experience

1235.16 --> 1241.28
was all originally triggered

1238.76 --> 1243.26
through yeah through the world yeah

1241.28 --> 1246.559
through our bodies

1243.26 --> 1250.46
enabling that and giving us that

1246.559 --> 1253.7
experience to then have that reflected

1250.46 --> 1256.4
in our dreams and yeah included so

1253.7 --> 1259.66
that's a lot of what have been kind of

1256.4 --> 1259.66
dreaming about and

1260.9 --> 1266.299
and that is like distracting enough like

1263.84 --> 1268.0
not to be very actively watching or

1266.299 --> 1271.36
pursuing

1268.0 --> 1271.36
interesting videos

1339.039 --> 1343.9
why devil why devil yeah I love that

1344.9 --> 1350.3600000000001
if I have to be honest that even when I

1347.48 --> 1354.5
call myself white devil it is a little

1350.36 --> 1357.3799999999999
bit more menacing but it is also

1354.5 --> 1361.299
doubling as a joke that I have actually

1357.38 --> 1361.2990000000002
slightly inspired on that

1361.7 --> 1366.32
on the second aceven to remove you when

1363.919 --> 1369.22
you did that because it was really

1366.32 --> 1369.22
freaking funny

1369.74 --> 1374.08
because he was just really into it

1374.82 --> 1378.74
[Music]

1376.52 --> 1382.94
yeah Ace Ventura has been very inspiring

1378.74 --> 1385.64
figure with his Mania to me to show that

1382.94 --> 1387.919
you can actually do something

1385.64 --> 1391.039
with that

1387.919 --> 1393.2
that's not just being crazy that you can

1391.039 --> 1394.46
actually tame that and build something

1393.2 --> 1399.3400000000001
with it

1394.46 --> 1399.3400000000001
so yeah very inspiring example to me

1414.14 --> 1416.919
uh

1418.4 --> 1427.249
foreign

1421.27 --> 1427.249
[Music]

1431.38 --> 1434.669
[Music]

1437.24 --> 1440.08
amazing

1444.86 --> 1449.299
I don't know yeah I hope he's still

1447.98 --> 1453.44
holding on

1449.299 --> 1457.039
to that to that power and not just

1453.44 --> 1458.67
slipping into Marxism

1457.039 --> 1463.999
anyway

1458.67 --> 1463.999
[Music]

1469.3 --> 1472.599
[Music]

1474.92 --> 1478.13
[Music]

1483.799 --> 1486.799
foreign

1497.72 --> 1504.269
think of yeah I'm gonna try to

1501.16 --> 1504.269
[Music]

1505.159 --> 1509.7800000000002
figure out a little formula of how you

1507.799 --> 1512.36
could see what might be going on like

1509.78 --> 1516.34
even Beyond Death

1512.36 --> 1516.34
so what if people simply

1519.02 --> 1528.08
sink into their favorite potential

1524.0 --> 1531.7
like the thing like we chase the things

1528.08 --> 1531.6999999999998
that we like in life

1532.059 --> 1540.5
even make sacrifices to get there or

1535.4 --> 1542.96
endure things to go through with it Etc

1540.5 --> 1547.4
and this is all potential and

1542.96 --> 1549.74
can't always like fulfill potential

1547.4 --> 1551.96
and even if you fulfill potential then

1549.74 --> 1553.039
that might even kind of like break it

1551.96 --> 1555.74
off

1553.039 --> 1558.2
from your interest

1555.74 --> 1561.14
but it's very logical to me that after

1558.2 --> 1563.24
death you would well no longer be able

1561.14 --> 1566.419
to manifest potential

1563.24 --> 1568.88
but you could perhaps dwell among it

1566.419 --> 1570.0800000000002
which would probably be experienced like

1568.88 --> 1571.5200000000002
a heaven

1570.08 --> 1575.72
and then

1571.52 --> 1578.24
that would also mean that all potential

1575.72 --> 1581.659
of the living

1578.24 --> 1583.76
is basically like if you seek out a

1581.659 --> 1586.279
frequency you're gonna

1583.76 --> 1588.559
bump into the

1586.279 --> 1589.94
dormant

1588.559 --> 1594.22
spirit

1589.94 --> 1594.22
of The Talented of that frequency

1596.24 --> 1601.82
wouldn't that be interesting

1599.36 --> 1604.34
and then you'd also well get all these

1601.82 --> 1606.3799999999999
synchronicities so it's like

1604.34 --> 1608.48
I'm seeing it as like you're a living

1606.38 --> 1610.94
person you're in a moment of inspiration

1608.48 --> 1613.279
and then suddenly all these people that

1610.94 --> 1614.9
touched upon the similar inspiration are

1613.279 --> 1617.0
looking over your shoulder from the

1614.9 --> 1619.8200000000002
other realm you probably won't notice it

1617.0 --> 1621.38
you might feel something or strength

1619.82 --> 1623.36
boosting up

1621.38 --> 1625.94
they're looking with you

1623.36 --> 1628.1589999999999
and then you figure out an idea or

1625.94 --> 1630.5
system and then you go research and then

1628.159 --> 1632.779
you find well there are several people

1630.5 --> 1635.6
that have also

1632.779 --> 1637.64
had this insight and they wrote about it

1635.6 --> 1640.52
and that literally might be people from

1637.64 --> 1642.6200000000001
the past that are in this time looking

1640.52 --> 1644.84
over your shoulder from the other side

1642.62 --> 1646.1
because you go there

1644.84 --> 1649.52
so that

1646.1 --> 1651.86
when you dig into somebody's research

1649.52 --> 1654.3799999999999
that was close to their heart it's

1651.86 --> 1656.84
likely that they're in heaven

1654.38 --> 1658.7
still touching that and that you touch

1656.84 --> 1662.24
their spirit

1658.7 --> 1665.3600000000001
from the afterlife by touching

1662.24 --> 1668.72
the well the part of the akashic library

1665.36 --> 1672.08
that they also attached that was

1668.72 --> 1674.3600000000001
that they that they manifested into the

1672.08 --> 1676.039
physical world and thereby intricately

1674.36 --> 1678.82
became linked

1676.039 --> 1681.62
being extremely

1678.82 --> 1684.8799999999999
esoteric here I hope people are

1681.62 --> 1684.8799999999999
understanding what I'm saying

1685.1 --> 1690.74
kind of improvising but this is the type

1688.039 --> 1692.45
of fractal pattern that

1690.74 --> 1695.299
I do

1692.45 --> 1698.0
[Music]

1695.299 --> 1699.86
yeah you're doing things there's another

1698.0 --> 1702.32
layer on top of it that you probably

1699.86 --> 1704.36
wouldn't have thought about and there's

1702.32 --> 1706.7
a layer on top of that that you also

1704.36 --> 1709.4599999999998
haven't thought about and this is An

1706.7 --> 1711.44
Occurrence that happens at all times

1709.46 --> 1714.559
so I'm always seeing this sort of thing

1711.44 --> 1716.3600000000001
there's things happen we understand it

1714.559 --> 1717.799
but then we Overlook how there's things

1716.36 --> 1719.8999999999999
on top of that

1717.799 --> 1721.22
you might never figure that out you

1719.9 --> 1723.0800000000002
might never have an interest to figure

1721.22 --> 1725.419
that out

1723.08 --> 1727.82
but it's there

1725.419 --> 1729.44
so it also connects into the Eternal

1727.82 --> 1731.24
wisdom

1729.44 --> 1735.02
a wise man knows they know nothing

1731.24 --> 1737.5
because there's always more

1735.02 --> 1737.5
right

1738.6 --> 1741.81
[Music]

1742.72 --> 1746.98
oh [ __ ] did you see that

1749.539 --> 1752.26
what happened

1755.539 --> 1758.74
yeah good luck with that

1763.279 --> 1775.529
hmm

1764.09 --> 1775.529
[Music]

1777.44 --> 1782.559
yeah good luck we just seen it and we'll

1779.96 --> 1782.559
see you tomorrow

1782.83 --> 1788.8899999999999
[Music]

1792.919 --> 1795.3990000000001
right

1795.559 --> 1802.24
but yeah what I'm basically doing is

1799.22 --> 1804.98
kind of like trying to back engineer

1802.24 --> 1808.36
influences of the spirit Realm

1804.98 --> 1810.919
from a mechanical perspective in which

1808.36 --> 1815.62
[Music]

1810.919 --> 1815.6200000000001
human life and death is a part

1819.57 --> 1822.77
[Music]

1824.6 --> 1828.9189999999999
right and from that perspective you

1826.88 --> 1832.3990000000001
could also kind of like try to figure

1828.919 --> 1834.679
out what is it like for these spirits

1832.399 --> 1838.82
that are dead

1834.679 --> 1841.3990000000001
to basically be in there in their little

1838.82 --> 1843.74
heaven and maybe some of them still kind

1841.399 --> 1845.9599999999998
of reach out to the world of the living

1843.74 --> 1848.48
maybe some of them are like looking like

1845.96 --> 1851.779
oh are there is this person gonna build

1848.48 --> 1854.8990000000001
up the momentum to reach out with their

1851.779 --> 1857.179
talent to get to my frequency

1854.899 --> 1859.1
are they like rooting for the youngsters

1857.179 --> 1861.3200000000002
like oh is he gonna get it is he gonna

1859.1 --> 1863.62
get it from the other side this could be

1861.32 --> 1863.62
a thing

1864.159 --> 1869.779
it might be something that's literally

1866.48 --> 1872.19
constantly happening just not really in

1869.779 --> 1877.809
our awareness

1872.19 --> 1877.809
[Music]

1878.72 --> 1881.72
right

1881.899 --> 1886.34
I'd imagine at least that

1884.44 --> 1891.14
[Music]

1886.34 --> 1893.36
people that have become parents

1891.14 --> 1895.76
and grandparents perhaps and then they

1893.36 --> 1898.52
eventually die that they will have that

1895.76 --> 1900.08
connection uniquely to their family line

1898.52 --> 1902.72
also

1900.08 --> 1903.86
they should always be rooting for their

1902.72 --> 1906.98
family

1903.86 --> 1909.559
to get through things successfully to

1906.98 --> 1912.02
not become a dead end

1909.559 --> 1915.799
so that should be a very big like that's

1912.02 --> 1916.76
beside the love for skill or Talent is

1915.799 --> 1919.7
just

1916.76 --> 1922.46
the the family Connection in that sense

1919.7 --> 1926.1200000000001
there should probably be ancestors that

1922.46 --> 1928.22
are literally just writing

1926.12 --> 1931.34
with the survivors basically of the

1928.22 --> 1933.76
family like rooting for them to get

1931.34 --> 1933.76
through it

1934.7 --> 1938.32
I think about these things

1942.51 --> 1951.32
[Music]

1947.919 --> 1954.0800000000002
what manifesting somewhere

1951.32 --> 1957.26
maybe the letter Sage

1954.08 --> 1960.9399999999998
probably I mean they could probably get

1957.26 --> 1960.94
an energy body temporarily

1963.62 --> 1968.9799999999998
but is that really worth it

1966.2 --> 1972.0800000000002
I mean if there is massive excess energy

1968.98 --> 1975.38
naturally because of some God's decree

1972.08 --> 1975.75
or something some thing then sure why

1975.38 --> 1977.1200000000001
not

1975.75 --> 1980.84
[Music]

1977.12 --> 1984.26
like we should not strive from within

1980.84 --> 1987.3799999999999
Humanity to achieve such a thing

1984.26 --> 1989.559
should just leave it to Nature to God's

1987.38 --> 1989.5590000000002

2098.74 --> 2102.7
a phone on the other side unless that

2100.66 --> 2105.58
phone is literally like in your living

2102.7 --> 2108.3999999999996

talked about it in extreme detail

2666.46 --> 2670.359
spread out over years

I don't have any proof for that either

2670.359 --> 2677.16
but I know it happened and

2672.819 --> 2677.16
very consistent in the explanation

2677.38 --> 2682.54
and yeah slow my moon Buggy's story does

2681.64 --> 2684.339
not

2682.54 --> 2686.8

2696.4 --> 2699.1800000000003

2705.16 --> 2710.5
especially like if they are like in the

2708.4 --> 2712.48

2710.5 --> 2714.4

2712.48 --> 2717.599

but you know as a general question any

2744.4 --> 2749.26
proof that's ridiculous

2747.339 --> 2751.619
I mean what do you expect that we're

2749.26 --> 2751.619
just gonna

2751.78 --> 2757.48
like how the hell do you prove that

2755.5 --> 2759.52
that's like saying like how could it

2757.48 --> 2761.98
have not been faked yeah it could

2759.52 --> 2765.46
absolutely these takes can be faked and

2761.98 --> 2768.76
somebody can even be lying about

2765.46 --> 2771.579
seeing such things technically like you

2768.76 --> 2774.4
can't exclude that right that's why this

2771.579 --> 2776.619
has nothing to do with science Natural

2776.619 --> 2779.46

3192.059 --> 3198.96
yeah 21 28

3196.079 --> 3201.42
pretty much my entire 20s I was like

3198.96 --> 3203.579
that constantly because I was always

3201.42 --> 3206.2200000000003
thinking about like highly Spirit

3203.579 --> 3209.28
mechanical things from my learning

3206.22 --> 3211.98
vantage point of that time

3209.28 --> 3215.2400000000002
so it was always like people like oh oh

3211.98 --> 3219.2400000000002
how are you and I'm like

3215.24 --> 3221.2799999999997
how about this magic thing

3219.24 --> 3224.7599999999998
it was always like waiting for the

3221.28 --> 3229.1600000000003
opportunity to just drop some extreme

3224.76 --> 3229.1600000000003
thing on people and blow their minds

3233.64 --> 3238.4
so typical so I totally get that

3240.42 --> 3244.7000000000003
now I just don't really bother anymore

3252.48 --> 3257.099
I I think it's because of the empathy

3254.64 --> 3258.5989999999997
also my empathy skill that I haven't cut

3257.099 --> 3261.48
off

3258.599 --> 3264.2400000000002
it's just that I perceive so many things

3261.48 --> 3267.119
now and influences it's like there's

3264.24 --> 3268.9799999999996
another spiritual Highway parallel to

3267.119 --> 3271.44
everything

3268.98 --> 3275.3
and it's almost getting distracting to

3271.44 --> 3275.3
me to even focus on it

3276.96 --> 3282.839
so it's almost like yeah stop bringing

3280.68 --> 3286.02
up the ghosts they're distracting enough

3282.839 --> 3289.15
already as they are right that's kind of

3294.119 --> 3299.339

3299.339 --> 3304.5589999999997
they're like oh yeah we're finally

3301.38 --> 3309.2000000000003

really into spooky and

3381.54 --> 3387.7799999999997
and ghosts and spirits

3384.66 --> 3390.66

3387.78 --> 3393.059
they would be like yeah weird like we

3390.66 --> 3395.5789999999997
don't talk about that

the the British pound

5073.3 --> 5079.659000000001
is it like a stable balance between

like is it really a separate system or

5079.659 --> 5083.86
are they like basically brothers that
