116.399 --> 124.22
need to get some support I mean this has

119.64 --> 124.22
been the driest week like in a year

125.159 --> 132.56
and like I

128.039 --> 136.379
am going to be completely out of money

132.56 --> 138.959
and without any maneuvering room to like

136.379 --> 141.5
borrow any so I really need to support

138.959 --> 141.5
right now

141.9 --> 144.5
please

145.02 --> 151.62
please help your local Arwen anyway I

148.92 --> 155.35999999999999
got the new webcam in so

151.62 --> 155.36
this is like the first test

155.94 --> 159.68
looks a lot better doesn't it

163.2 --> 167.89999999999998
because it is basically the old model

168.78 --> 174.019
I would really like to get some feedback

171.3 --> 174.019
on this

175.68 --> 180.06
anyway the weather outside is

178.739 --> 182.16
well the same thing as yesterday

180.06 --> 184.8
happened it was a beautiful Clear Blue

182.16 --> 186.239
Sky and then they trailed the crap out

184.8 --> 189.42000000000002
of it

186.239 --> 191.70000000000002
and now it's kind of hazy

189.42 --> 194.89999999999998
there's wind there's hasn't been any

191.7 --> 194.89999999999998
rain so it's kind of dry

197.34 --> 203.22
but yeah with all that Haze covering the

200.04 --> 206.34
sun now it's it's cooling off

203.22 --> 207.72
so not exactly happy about that it was

206.34 --> 210.98
kind of pleasant to have that bright

207.72 --> 210.98
sunlight early though

211.04 --> 215.94
yeah the wire on this thing is kind of

214.44 --> 220.4
short by the way

215.94 --> 220.4
but it's still manageable

226.86 --> 229.15900000000002
anyway

230.819 --> 233.659
where's everybody

243.48 --> 246.319
right

253.379 --> 258.139
let's just spread the links

270.139 --> 275.16
right share the show

273.3 --> 279.0
would be great

275.16 --> 281.16
people came and came over and visited

279.0 --> 283.139
I mean yeah in the United States is

281.16 --> 285.36
going to be very early of course but I

283.139 --> 287.94
mean there's still plenty of people in

285.36 --> 290.82
England right I mean

287.94 --> 293.66
lots of people go visiting during the

290.82 --> 293.65999999999997
Flat Earth debates

295.4 --> 300.67999999999995
right anyway it is

301.259 --> 306.66
Saturday the 7th of January 2023

312.18 --> 316.919
right and I've been very very active

314.88 --> 319.74
yesterday I thought it was gonna kind of

316.919 --> 321.9
have a bit of a burnout but it's turned

319.74 --> 324.539
out not to be get that bad

321.9 --> 328.15999999999997
but I've been so active yesterday

324.539 --> 328.15999999999997
got him flat sides

328.979 --> 334.139
and went full Baldwin

331.68 --> 334.979
but yeah I've been listening back to

334.139 --> 337.5
that

334.979 --> 338.9
it was a lot of fun to do but I mean

337.5 --> 342.419
like

338.9 --> 344.94
flatsoids sound concerning everybody on

342.419 --> 347.28
Discord was really muffled

344.94 --> 348.96
and yeah you couldn't really make out

347.28 --> 351.29999999999995
exactly what it was saying at times

348.96 --> 353.82
which is kind of a shame

351.3 --> 355.5
but yeah there was this baller guy that

353.82 --> 359.15999999999997
got in there

355.5 --> 361.8
and he was making a mess of things

359.16 --> 363.72
and so I kind of stepped in as ball and

361.8 --> 366.36
then basically tried to re-educate him

363.72 --> 369.36
like hey stop making the ball look bad

366.36 --> 373.1
you're getting it wrong continually

369.36 --> 373.1
like this is not the way to do it

373.74 --> 378.72
and with actual

375.66 --> 380.94
real advice I mean I didn't even try to

378.72 --> 382.56
entrap him

380.94 --> 384.6
you don't need to

382.56 --> 386.28000000000003
I mean once you really get it you

384.6 --> 389.46000000000004
realize you don't really need to because

386.28 --> 391.75899999999996
it you there he leaves you can't get out

389.46 --> 391.75899999999996
of it

391.979 --> 395.639
the only thing you can do is keep

394.259 --> 398.6
digging

395.639 --> 398.6
the right way

399.78 --> 405.19899999999996
anyway hope somebody's gonna show up in

402.479 --> 405.199
my chat soon

415.74 --> 418.52
hello hello

426.0 --> 430.259
right LSG

427.979 --> 432.71999999999997
was there too

430.259 --> 436.07
by the way that was fun I had a good

432.72 --> 439.38000000000005
conversation with him over Skype earlier

436.07 --> 442.639
[Music]

439.38 --> 447.36
in a bit of a he's like in the winter

442.639 --> 450.199
situation so it's kind of tough on him

447.36 --> 450.199
but uh

451.02 --> 454.5
yeah I mean it's been tough on a lot of

453.12 --> 457.38
people it's been kind of tough on me

454.5 --> 459.539
this last week me like not having great

457.38 --> 462.08
moods and well the support kind of

459.539 --> 462.08
drying up

462.419 --> 467.88
I mean that really does contribute I

464.88 --> 469.5
mean I'm doing my best I can do like I

467.88 --> 473.34
can do this I can do the show every day

469.5 --> 477.24
but like if there's money worries I'm

473.34 --> 479.46
gonna like start to feel resentment

477.24 --> 481.88
which is very disruptive to my

479.46 --> 481.88
performance

482.58 --> 487.25899999999996
right it

484.44 --> 490.199
clicks my attitude

487.259 --> 492.41900000000004
and what I do by accident I don't mean

490.199 --> 495.599
to do that but it's what happens when I

492.419 --> 498.419
just am worried about money too much

495.599 --> 500.699
anyway hello Susanna blocker first in

498.419 --> 502.919
chat thanks for for popping by happy New

500.699 --> 504.78000000000003
Year you're sorry no you don't have to

502.919 --> 507.34999999999997
be sorry

504.78 --> 510.55899999999997
I think you're pretty new

507.35 --> 510.559
[Music]

512.339 --> 514.82
right

518.279 --> 523.37
I'm just a little worried here because

520.32 --> 526.57
well I don't like starving

523.37 --> 526.57
[Music]

530.399 --> 535.14
you know food for like to get through to

533.04 --> 539.04
Monday probably

535.14 --> 542.6999999999999
but after that it's gonna be out it's

539.04 --> 544.62
going to be completely gone pretty much

542.7 --> 546.72
and send you some of that right

544.62 --> 548.7
you don't have PayPal oh that's gonna

546.72 --> 550.14
that's difficult then thank you by the

548.7 --> 552.44
way for offering I really appreciate

550.14 --> 552.4399999999999
that

552.779 --> 557.0
it doesn't have to be regular

557.16 --> 561.959
I mean

558.6 --> 564.5400000000001
I really just need whatever I can get

561.959 --> 566.2199999999999
and I can be little bits

564.54 --> 568.86
from people

566.22 --> 571.5
or like big bulks all of a sudden

568.86 --> 574.32
somebody got lucky or made a good move

571.5 --> 578.16
in business you know

574.32 --> 580.62
I'm just trying to stay afloat and it's

578.16 --> 583.5799999999999
not exactly easy my country is under

580.62 --> 583.58
siege

585.18 --> 588.779
big time

586.44 --> 593.2790000000001
and costs are going up

588.779 --> 596.64
while my income is not really going up

593.279 --> 599.22
except well what through it's not income

596.64 --> 601.5
it's donations I'm surviving on

599.22 --> 604.44
donations literally

601.5 --> 608.58
like if I wouldn't do this and

604.44 --> 609.9590000000001
yeah basically move out of the loop here

608.58 --> 613.5600000000001
on YouTube

609.959 --> 615.66
I would actually starve because then I

613.56 --> 619.3389999999999
really wouldn't have enough

615.66 --> 619.3389999999999
not even for basic food

620.399 --> 626.76
and there's people out there

623.16 --> 629.9399999999999
in my situation without like oh my

626.76 --> 632.459
intellect and verbal talent and all that

629.94 --> 634.44
like they they they're not really

632.459 --> 636.3
capable of doing this

634.44 --> 638.1
I have to figure it out some other way

636.3 --> 639.959
and

638.1 --> 642.0
I mean I really feel for them there is

639.959 --> 643.0799999999999
there are Dutch people starving right

642.0 --> 645.839
now

643.08 --> 647.399
I mean it's not like a majority but it's

645.839 --> 649.86
still like that's

647.399 --> 652.56
very untouched

649.86 --> 653.64
to happen and people are really pissed

652.56 --> 655.92
off

653.64 --> 657.72
about it not just those that don't have

655.92 --> 660.12
anything to eat

657.72 --> 662.7
right when you're really hungry you can

660.12 --> 665.64
get pissed off you just fatigued you're

662.7 --> 666.48
just trying to stay alive somehow

665.64 --> 669.18
foreign

666.48 --> 672.8000000000001
anyway

669.18 --> 672.8
hey LSG good to see you man

674.94 --> 678.7790000000001
um

676.26 --> 681.4399999999999
sucks well don't worry man don't worry

678.779 --> 681.4399999999999
girl

681.66 --> 684.14
look

684.24 --> 689.16
I only take

687.48 --> 692.24
from those

689.16 --> 692.24
that can miss it

695.82 --> 702.5400000000001
if you just can't you can't

698.94 --> 705.74
and yeah that makes me very sad but

702.54 --> 705.74
that's just the way it is

707.94 --> 711.72
I'm really hoping for just more Outreach

710.279 --> 714.12
I've been

711.72 --> 717.24
putting myself

714.12 --> 719.339
on display everywhere

717.24 --> 722.339
I mean I when I go somewhere and I get

719.339 --> 724.5
in chat I do really perform and and

722.339 --> 727.1400000000001
people do take notice I mean like Jim

724.5 --> 729.06
Bob definitely takes notice highlights

727.14 --> 731.16
my comments regularly and hey yeah I

729.06 --> 732.4799999999999
make

731.16 --> 735.24
fun

732.48 --> 738.24
and sometimes really smart relevant

735.24 --> 741.3
comments I do my best to do that I mean

738.24 --> 743.88
that's like a job an unpaid job it's

741.3 --> 746.2199999999999
like a thing that I can do

743.88 --> 749.04
and I do that

746.22 --> 751.74
and I'm hoping to get some eyes and like

749.04 --> 753.899
hey people that are interested

751.74 --> 755.279
because this guy can really say smart

753.899 --> 757.98
things

755.279 --> 760.8
and that way drawing other people but

757.98 --> 764.12
maybe it's the time slot

760.8 --> 764.12
I don't know what it is

767.22 --> 771.0
it's probably the time slot and the time

769.92 --> 774.36
of year

771.0 --> 777.86
the winter period

774.36 --> 777.86
I am ma'am

779.279 --> 783.7
all right

780.49 --> 783.7
[Music]

784.32 --> 787.74
your mother

785.579 --> 789.8599999999999
you have family okay well that helps I

787.74 --> 789.86
mean

790.38 --> 795.42
as Owen Benjamin says

792.66 --> 798.6
in the category where you actually does

795.42 --> 801.12
have wisdom unlike physics

798.6 --> 804.62
yeah family as well

801.12 --> 804.62
he's so right about that

805.32 --> 810.36
unfortunately I'm poorer like that

808.26 --> 812.76
although I mean I have a good relation

810.36 --> 815.339
with my dad and I feel so lucky that I

812.76 --> 822.079
do and it's so helpful and

815.339 --> 822.0790000000001
I really do my best to be a a worthy son

824.88 --> 831.56
even though I am kind of a hermit and

829.56 --> 834.779
intense

831.56 --> 836.9399999999999
personality which is burdensome on my

834.779 --> 838.92
dad and so I really try to protect him

836.94 --> 841.98
from that I mean he's getting older

838.92 --> 843.779
and he has the wisdom of knowing what's

841.98 --> 846.36
going on with me but it's still burden

843.779 --> 848.88
it can't just like

846.36 --> 851.16
throw my full force or rage win or

848.88 --> 853.32
something and that's like I take care of

851.16 --> 856.279
my dad like that

853.32 --> 856.279
very careful

857.639 --> 860.1800000000001
anyway

865.079 --> 870.779
right he's doing fine by the way I mean

869.16 --> 872.279
he's doing pretty I think he's doing

870.779 --> 876.26
better than me

872.279 --> 876.26
but that's I mean he deserves it

877.139 --> 881.48
he does

878.519 --> 881.48
yeah he's uh

883.199 --> 889.199
he's always keeping himself busy

886.44 --> 893.399
with productive things

889.199 --> 894.54
very commendable for a man of that age

893.399 --> 896.18
all right

894.54 --> 898.02
anyway

896.18 --> 900.12
I said oh

898.02 --> 902.899
[Music]

900.12 --> 902.899
it's in Canada

903.24 --> 909.0600000000001
okay in this is that like a

907.139 --> 912.779
I don't mean to butt in or anything but

909.06 --> 916.079
you did bring it up though Susanna

912.779 --> 918.72
but is that like a

916.079 --> 920.8199999999999
like a real break and he's like he can't

918.72 --> 923.88
get out of it or is that a reoccurring

920.82 --> 926.279
thing for some people it is like you get

923.88 --> 928.139
the winter tick and you go a little bit

926.279 --> 931.32
weird or something right it happens to a

928.139 --> 933.42
lot of it it kind of happened to me it's

931.32 --> 935.4590000000001
just that I have all these skills and in

933.42 --> 937.38
my own psychologist so I know really

935.459 --> 939.899
kind of how to deal with it without

937.38 --> 941.519
actually losing it

939.899 --> 944.82
which is what happens to a lot of people

941.519 --> 946.5600000000001
and then winter moves on and spring

944.82 --> 948.1800000000001
comes back and they kind of like get

946.56 --> 951.18
their senses back that happens to some

948.18 --> 953.5999999999999
people is that the case or is it much

951.18 --> 958.579
more serious

953.6 --> 958.5790000000001
hey turret 306 good to see you man

961.66 --> 967.88
[Music]

964.139 --> 967.88
hey steamy traveler good to see you

968.1 --> 972.9590000000001
I should stop being so late on my own

970.74 --> 975.5
shows because a lot of people now kind

972.959 --> 978.4799999999999
of arrive

975.5 --> 980.579
later so then I start early and

978.48 --> 983.0
everybody's late it's it's my own fault

980.579 --> 983.0
I bet

983.16 --> 987.42
it's just the anticipation I mean nobody

985.26 --> 989.639
wants to wait 15 minutes for a stream to

987.42 --> 992.42
start new camera yes

989.639 --> 992.42
you noticed

993.959 --> 1000.199
yeah this is the new one

996.72 --> 1003.62
which is almost identical looking to the

1000.199 --> 1008.3199999999999
old one slightly minor differences but

1003.62 --> 1008.32
it's literally the same physical model

1008.839 --> 1014.24
and it seems the same let me show you

1011.54 --> 1016.04
now that more people are looking

1014.24 --> 1020.839
okay

1016.04 --> 1023.48
the chord is a bit short but I mean the

1020.839 --> 1025.76
the dynamic of it right this is exactly

1023.48 --> 1028.16
like the other camera would

1025.76 --> 1029.839
maybe even a little better I don't know

1028.16 --> 1033.16
I would have to test it when it's like

1029.839 --> 1037.579
really bright and sunny

1033.16 --> 1040.4
but it's doing pretty good

1037.579 --> 1042.86
it's like better than the other one that

1040.4 --> 1046.66
does weird contrasting things

1042.86 --> 1046.6599999999999
this one doesn't seem to be doing that

1060.98 --> 1067.22
too much Shadow yeah but it's also kind

1063.62 --> 1070.2199999999998
of it's not very bright

1067.22 --> 1072.94
that died in that car oh Jesus

1070.22 --> 1072.94
okay

1074.62 --> 1080.02
too much do you see pills what

1080.6 --> 1083.3799999999999
pills

1091.34 --> 1097.1789999999999
I don't get it what the hell is a THC

1094.1 --> 1097.1789999999999
but I never heard of that

1099.98 --> 1102.82
oils

1103.1 --> 1105.6399999999999
foreign

1108.039 --> 1116.539
well any psychotic like effect that you

1113.48 --> 1119.179
might experience when you have super

1116.539 --> 1121.039
high dosages of THC which is very

1119.179 --> 1124.039
unpleasant by the way

1121.039 --> 1126.74
usually considered a bad trip

1124.039 --> 1131.799
right and CBD is absolutely doesn't

1126.74 --> 1131.799
affect you psychologically but THC does

1132.02 --> 1138.44
right but that is only temporary that

1135.74 --> 1140.799
really can only be temporary like THC

1138.44 --> 1140.799
can't

1140.98 --> 1147.679
unless you're like really super

1144.039 --> 1150.2
sensitive already to uh

1147.679 --> 1152.6000000000001
to yeah schizophrenia I mean although

1150.2 --> 1156.2
that's except yeah if you have schizoid

1152.6 --> 1161.24
traits and I have slight schizoid traits

1156.2 --> 1164.299
and yeah that's just the fact sorry

1161.24 --> 1167.1200000000001
I got it very much under control though

1164.299 --> 1169.8799999999999
right but if you have that

1167.12 --> 1172.34
and you have it more and then you do

1169.88 --> 1174.38
that yeah but that's simply called

1172.34 --> 1178.3999999999999
triggering it then

1174.38 --> 1182.0
right and I've had worse things like if

1178.4 --> 1183.98
you're even slight schizoid and you risk

1182.0 --> 1186.52
touching

1183.98 --> 1190.22
Ayahuasca for example which is much more

1186.52 --> 1194.059
extreme hallucinatory drug

1190.22 --> 1195.799
then things can get really bad

1194.059 --> 1198.26
it's very dangerous

1195.799 --> 1199.82
you that's something you can really lose

1198.26 --> 1202.34
your mind from and never get it back

1199.82 --> 1205.48
well you might get it back but it might

1202.34 --> 1205.48
take like decades

1205.64 --> 1210.2
or you have to have like a really good

1208.22 --> 1213.58
spirit healer

1210.2 --> 1216.799
it's super complicated anyway I still

1213.58 --> 1219.1399999999999
basically deal with sort of scars from

1216.799 --> 1220.76
things that happened 20 years ago like

1219.14 --> 1223.3400000000001
that

1220.76 --> 1225.919
brought me a lot of interesting bizarre

1223.34 --> 1227.4189999999999
memories as well that are kind of

1225.919 --> 1230.1200000000001
fascinating

1227.419 --> 1233.9
I got a story to tell because of it but

1230.12 --> 1235.8799999999999
it has left scars on me right

1233.9 --> 1239.0
yeah

1235.88 --> 1241.5200000000002
but yeah I've never heard

1239.0 --> 1244.82
voices is hearing right

1241.52 --> 1246.62
yeah but you don't just get voices from

1244.82 --> 1251.6
THC

1246.62 --> 1254.2399999999998
but all THC really does is amplify your

1251.6 --> 1255.74
sensories in all directions including

1254.24 --> 1257.66
inward

1255.74 --> 1261.02
so if you have a tendency for voices

1257.66 --> 1264.74
then they might pop up

1261.02 --> 1268.0
if you use lots of THC high dosage but

1264.74 --> 1268.0
you're not used to it especially

1268.16 --> 1273.98
and you haven't heard it before

1270.5 --> 1276.82
that does happen to those that have that

1273.98 --> 1276.82
potential

1277.58 --> 1281.86
right so you got to be careful I mean

1282.679 --> 1286.46
there are some people out there that are

1284.6 --> 1289.52
like way too sensitive and they just

1286.46 --> 1292.299
should really stay clear of of every

1289.52 --> 1295.6
drug including Pharmaceuticals because

1292.299 --> 1299.72
like official

1295.6 --> 1303.32
Pharmaceuticals are often even worse

1299.72 --> 1306.5
especially like antidepressant types

1303.32 --> 1310.539
ssris those are like

1306.5 --> 1310.539
yeah anyway that's another story

1314.48 --> 1319.1
right because that's how you get over

1316.58 --> 1323.98
that I mean THC

1319.1 --> 1323.98
too much you just sleep it off

1329.96 --> 1334.22
well yeah

1332.36 --> 1336.9189999999999
you'll probably have a lot of intense

1334.22 --> 1339.14
dreams that are very challenging in that

1336.919 --> 1342.44
period

1339.14 --> 1344.2990000000002
or absolutely no dreams and then that is

1342.44 --> 1348.64
challenging about it because

1344.299 --> 1348.6399999999999
it's probably used to them anyway

1352.84 --> 1358.6399999999999
yeah no but I look

1356.059 --> 1361.039
I've been a cannabis user

1358.64 --> 1362.9
more than half my life

1361.039 --> 1365.6589999999999
and

1362.9 --> 1367.039
well as I said I've slides schizoid

1365.659 --> 1369.8600000000001
traits

1367.039 --> 1370.7
and so there have been worries towards

1369.86 --> 1374.0
me

1370.7 --> 1376.159
about that and like I had I just learned

1374.0 --> 1379.84
about all that I learned a lot about it

1376.159 --> 1379.8400000000001
about what can happen and

1380.96 --> 1385.8400000000001
or was are some schizo traits

1388.64 --> 1392.5
how do you suppress control them

1398.48 --> 1405.52
it's really complicated it's all about

1402.62 --> 1409.039
like your drive and your perception

1405.52 --> 1411.3799999999999
you can't just

1409.039 --> 1414.74
like oh you just do this that and that

1411.38 --> 1417.2
right no no no no it's like with artists

1414.74 --> 1418.28
like everybody has it's their own little

1417.2 --> 1421.5800000000002
puzzle

1418.28 --> 1424.3999999999999
and they typically get stuck in a

1421.58 --> 1427.52
certain mode right and schizos have that

1424.4 --> 1431.48
too but in another field

1427.52 --> 1432.98
more in the internal world and schizos

1431.48 --> 1436.28
are often

1432.98 --> 1438.32
have lucid dreams and they have a

1436.28 --> 1440.36
tendency typically and that's how skin

1438.32 --> 1442.34
cells are often recognized that they get

1440.36 --> 1445.1789999999999
really distracted by their dreams or

1442.34 --> 1445.1789999999999
obsessed with them

1451.039 --> 1456.919
right anyway

1454.4 --> 1460.88
hey guns on their own good to see you

1456.919 --> 1463.48
apologize about the donation yeah

1460.88 --> 1467.9
oh [ __ ]

1463.48 --> 1473.299
all right guns damn it I'm not it's okay

1467.9 --> 1473.299
man you're not the only one I mean ah

1483.799 --> 1489.559
right yeah Susanna blacker I think based

1487.22 --> 1492.5
on that information you gave me which

1489.559 --> 1494.36
already starts to fill in some of the

1492.5 --> 1496.159
spiritual matter that are concerning his

1494.36 --> 1498.5
schizoid state

1496.159 --> 1501.14
right because it's all based on the

1498.5 --> 1502.46
actual empirical information that's how

1501.14 --> 1504.74
you really know how to deal with that's

1502.46 --> 1507.02
how I figure it out it you I can't

1504.74 --> 1508.76
communicate I could just do it

1507.02 --> 1512.299
but

1508.76 --> 1514.8799999999999
yeah when somebody's really hyper

1512.299 --> 1518.48
especially if there's kids so I they

1514.88 --> 1521.3600000000001
should not be like

1518.48 --> 1523.159
getting into cannabis because why you

1521.36 --> 1525.62
overdo it

1523.159 --> 1526.7
it's like Mania Mania is like very

1525.62 --> 1529.4599999999998
dangerous

1526.7 --> 1533.6200000000001
because it makes you do things and like

1529.46 --> 1533.6200000000001
over estimate your own capacities

1533.72 --> 1537.919
right

1534.98 --> 1541.159
and most bad trips because I have had

1537.919 --> 1543.44
them on cannabis that I've had was when

1541.159 --> 1545.779
I was manic I was like yeah so an

1543.44 --> 1547.4
enthusiastic oh man I'm gonna like I'm

1545.779 --> 1549.14
gonna down this joint and then I smoke

1547.4 --> 1552.26
it too quickly and then afterwards like

1549.14 --> 1555.5
oh Jesus what the [ __ ] did I do

1552.26 --> 1558.08
because of that enthusiasm

1555.5 --> 1561.14
it's very difficult to tackle with that

1558.08 --> 1563.539
Essences yeah yourself because it's so

1561.14 --> 1565.94
it's very seducing it's like a

1563.539 --> 1567.74
luciferian effect it's just calling you

1565.94 --> 1570.0800000000002
it's hard to you've got to give in

1567.74 --> 1571.88
because it feels so great

1570.08 --> 1573.9189999999999
you know there's an outsider it's very

1571.88 --> 1575.779
difficult to stop somebody when they're

1573.919 --> 1577.8200000000002
in that mood because they can suddenly

1575.779 --> 1579.559
turn hostile because they're really

1577.82 --> 1582.02
angry you're trying to snap them out of

1579.559 --> 1585.6399999999999
that dream because it's so pleasant

1582.02 --> 1585.6399999999999
it's very difficult to deal with

1587.84 --> 1591.76
the best thing is to try to

1593.179 --> 1598.46
educate them about how that works that

1596.419 --> 1601.5800000000002
cycle that interaction cycle their own

1598.46 --> 1604.159
awareness before they get to that stage

1601.58 --> 1607.58
right because usually it's like same

1604.159 --> 1609.3200000000002
asthmatic depression cycle manic then

1607.58 --> 1611.299
you crash something goes wrong because

1609.32 --> 1612.5
of it and then you're depressed and then

1611.299 --> 1613.94
you don't want to know about it anymore

1612.5 --> 1616.22
you just want to forget everything so

1613.94 --> 1619.22
you're not going to learn about it but

1616.22 --> 1620.96
then gradually forget about it get back

1619.22 --> 1624.2
to normal

1620.96 --> 1626.96
then start to get call out again go

1624.2 --> 1629.179
towards the Mania side that like right

1626.96 --> 1630.98
in the middle is when you start start

1629.179 --> 1634.1000000000001
where you need to approach say hey

1630.98 --> 1636.98
remember the last time now that you're

1634.1 --> 1641.5
like kind of more awoke and not super

1636.98 --> 1641.5
distracted or depressed right

1641.72 --> 1646.46
realize realize what you're going

1644.299 --> 1649.34
through and what will happen

1646.46 --> 1651.02
account for it prepare for it in your

1649.34 --> 1653.6589999999999
mind

1651.02 --> 1656.6589999999999
know how you work

1653.659 --> 1659.72
know what your feelings do with you be

1656.659 --> 1662.5390000000002
aware of it and then you can

1659.72 --> 1665.84
start to attempt to take responsibility

1662.539 --> 1666.98
and some grip on it and help Safeguard

1665.84 --> 1671.26
yourself

1666.98 --> 1671.26
making you less of a burden on others

1676.12 --> 1681.559
right and say it as neutral as possible

1678.5 --> 1683.72
no load no emotion it's like it's

1681.559 --> 1685.3999999999999
instruction it's like spiritual

1683.72 --> 1687.679
instruction

1685.4 --> 1692.0590000000002
all emotions are just gonna pull him

1687.679 --> 1694.75
back into the behavioral cycle itself

1692.059 --> 1702.6299999999999
anyway I hope that helps

1694.75 --> 1702.63
[Music]

1707.059 --> 1710.02
oh Jesus

1717.799 --> 1722.2
okay so then that really sucks

1724.4 --> 1730.419
right but hey if he Masters his mistake

1731.36 --> 1734.7199999999998
then he could technically get it all

1734.0 --> 1737.6
back

1734.72 --> 1739.22
right as long as he doesn't go moping as

1737.6 --> 1741.9399999999998
long as he doesn't give in to the

1739.22 --> 1741.94
Earthly feelings

1745.039 --> 1752.14
he needs to

1746.779 --> 1752.14
Master the mistake that caused it

1754.76 --> 1759.86
and I think the instructions that I just

1757.22 --> 1762.26
kind of forbade him gave you on what to

1759.86 --> 1765.02
do will be very helpful but you gotta

1762.26 --> 1766.1
have the exact right timing in the

1765.02 --> 1768.559
communication

1766.1 --> 1770.12
because again if you get go too soon and

1768.559 --> 1771.6789999999999
he's still depressed about when it went

1770.12 --> 1774.6789999999999
wrong he's not going to listen probably

1771.679 --> 1777.3200000000002
and if he's already up on the Up Cycle

1774.679 --> 1778.8200000000002
going towards that in the Mania he's not

1777.32 --> 1780.98
gonna listen either because he's already

1778.82 --> 1782.36
bound right you got to find the right

1780.98 --> 1784.94
timing

1782.36 --> 1786.3799999999999
you got to feel it out very carefully

1784.94 --> 1789.3200000000002
anyway

1786.38 --> 1791.5600000000002
come to a Holland

1789.32 --> 1794.78
okay

1791.56 --> 1794.78
[Music]

1811.36 --> 1814.36
foreign

1815.74 --> 1822.559
becoming the master of your mistake

1818.059 --> 1825.559
requires you to avoid escapism and

1822.559 --> 1827.36
embrace confrontation pretty much at all

1825.559 --> 1831.9189999999999
cost it's very

1827.36 --> 1834.559
very strenuous it's a real Challenge and

1831.919 --> 1838.3990000000001
when I go through such things it is like

1834.559 --> 1841.76
a military discipline that I imagine it

1838.399 --> 1845.62
for myself to be to keep myself straight

1841.76 --> 1845.62
because it is really

1846.38 --> 1851.2990000000002
like there's almost literally gonna be

1848.899 --> 1854.4799999999998
like Devils talking into you trying to

1851.299 --> 1856.58
talk you out of doing it

1854.48 --> 1858.679
sometimes through people sometimes

1856.58 --> 1861.32
through dreams like you get seduced from

1858.679 --> 1865.0590000000002
all sides to give it up when you really

1861.32 --> 1865.059
try to overcome that mistake

1866.659 --> 1870.88
when you're csoi so

1871.159 --> 1875.3600000000001
that's what happens

1872.96 --> 1878.539
it's kind of challenging

1875.36 --> 1879.74
so you gotta do it otherwise it rules

1878.539 --> 1880.85
you

1879.74 --> 1883.7
anyway

1880.85 --> 1887.779
[Music]

1883.7 --> 1891.26
and you can't force a guy like that to

1887.779 --> 1895.039
do the iron discipline they have to

1891.26 --> 1899.08
buy themselves internally realize it and

1895.039 --> 1901.82
then decide it like a life decision

1899.08 --> 1904.82
you can't force that on somebody ever it

1901.82 --> 1906.86
never works they have to to do that

1904.82 --> 1909.799
they have to

1906.86 --> 1913.12
like separated from the world decide

1909.799 --> 1913.12
that from there for themselves

1913.22 --> 1918.58
anyway

1915.44 --> 1918.5800000000002
I hope it all works out

1923.2 --> 1929.0
I mean if it's just cannabis

1926.899 --> 1931.76
that's like

1929.0 --> 1933.86
this yeah the sparking effect for that

1931.76 --> 1937.899
situation to happen

1933.86 --> 1937.899
then still very doable

1938.12 --> 1941.12
foreign

1944.26 --> 1949.1589999999999
schizoids that get involved with hard

1946.88 --> 1952.46
drugs and such like there's nothing you

1949.159 --> 1955.0390000000002
can do after that in my personal

1952.46 --> 1957.76
experience

1955.039 --> 1957.76

I'm glad I could help out with some

1982.399 --> 1984.76
advice

1986.299 --> 1989.74
thanks for trusting me

1991.52 --> 1996.679
hey LSG

1994.519 --> 1998.6
nice advice thanks

1996.679 --> 2001.0
thanks man

1998.6 --> 2003.76
I mean yeah

2001.0 --> 2006.399
if anybody else listening has a similar

2003.76 --> 2009.8799999999999
situation with a loved one it will

2006.399 --> 2011.799
probably apply I did I did lay it out in

2009.88 --> 2016.38
a very fractal way that it really does

2011.799 --> 2016.3799999999999
apply to like most people

2017.26 --> 2023.08
right to me it's really all about like

2019.6 --> 2027.279
gauges like it's this like a soundboard

2023.08 --> 2029.74
slider it's like oh where like what the

2027.279 --> 2033.039
percentage like I don't even say like oh

2029.74 --> 2035.32
is it this is it on this point of the

2033.039 --> 2037.96
slider exactly with the person oh let me

2035.32 --> 2040.6589999999999
give you this exact

2037.96 --> 2042.7
image based purely on it being like that

2040.659 --> 2044.919
no no I just say oh where is he on the

2042.7 --> 2046.779
slider okay if it's low it's like this

2044.919 --> 2049.179
it's middle it's like this it's higher

2046.779 --> 2052.06
like this and I do that I try to do that

2049.179 --> 2053.5
with like every Factor

2052.06 --> 2056.2
so that

2053.5 --> 2059.379
it it stays extremely Dynamic and can be

2056.2 --> 2061.5989999999997
adapted to pretty much any individual

2059.379 --> 2065.6
anyway

2061.599 --> 2071.389
for example good keep it that way

2065.6 --> 2071.389
[Music]

2073.62 --> 2076.699
[Music]

2076.8 --> 2080.159
oh no

2080.32 --> 2084.3
oh that's not true

2087.05 --> 2092.02
[Music]

2088.599 --> 2094.4190000000003
I mean yeah if he went really flipping

2092.02 --> 2098.68
and all that like out of his mind like

2094.419 --> 2102.96
really bad like epileptic level zygotic

2098.68 --> 2105.16
right yeah then maybe that

2102.96 --> 2107.26
antipsychotics might do something I

2105.16 --> 2109.72
don't know I've never been that bad

2107.26 --> 2112.78
thank God

2109.72 --> 2114.2799999999997
but like needs to get off that as soon

2112.78 --> 2117.6400000000003
as possible that stuff is actually

2114.28 --> 2119.2000000000003
really bad for your for your brain

2117.64 --> 2122.5
like

2119.2 --> 2125.22
it doesn't actually help the schizoid

2122.5 --> 2125.22
State at all

2136.66 --> 2139.44
Jesus

2140.82 --> 2147.579
yeah wow that's that's

2144.76 --> 2149.5600000000004
a bit of a euphemism there mental issue

2147.579 --> 2151.78
yeah you know if he's

2149.56 --> 2155.32
if you like

2151.78 --> 2158.02
get to the state where you are like

2155.32 --> 2160.7200000000003
full psychotic and like

2158.02 --> 2162.88
yeah then there's meds you might need or

2160.72 --> 2164.3199999999997
or you or you start acting like a

2162.88 --> 2168.46
psychotic killer

2164.32 --> 2171.099
yeah but that's that is like really

2168.46 --> 2173.8
deep like that

2171.099 --> 2177.52
probably some very serious trauma that

2173.8 --> 2180.3590000000004
late at the at the ground of that

2177.52 --> 2180.359
I don't know

2184.359 --> 2187.359
foreign

2192.099 --> 2196.42
well Susanna Becker look if you just

2194.14 --> 2198.22
rolled into a standard thing

2196.42 --> 2201.4
then look

2198.22 --> 2204.8799999999997
I got antipsychotics shoved in my face

2201.4 --> 2208.06
too it's just that I've never actually

2204.88 --> 2211.119
done anything that would provably hurt

2208.06 --> 2212.92
myself or others and that's why they

2211.119 --> 2215.38
were always oh we recommend you do it's

2212.92 --> 2216.94
like no you I didn't say it like this

2215.38 --> 2218.46
didn't give them lip but like you don't

2216.94 --> 2220.78
know what the [ __ ] you're talking about

2218.46 --> 2222.7
literally like and the individual

2220.78 --> 2224.98
recommending it is like do you know what

2222.7 --> 2227.0789999999997
this does

2224.98 --> 2230.38
and test them on like what they

2227.079 --> 2232.9
understand about it and they very rarely

2230.38 --> 2233.98
understood anything about it about the

2232.9 --> 2235.78
Pharmaceuticals that they're just

2233.98 --> 2237.66
following these stupid procedures they

2235.78 --> 2240.94
don't know what they're doing

2237.66 --> 2244.2
when they recommend that [ __ ]

2240.94 --> 2244.2000000000003
they don't know what it does

2248.5 --> 2254.02
I mean psych some psychiatrist might

2251.26 --> 2257.92
like actual psychiatrist because they

2254.02 --> 2261.72
have to have like the Pharma knowledge

2257.92 --> 2261.7200000000003
but yeah

2261.94 --> 2267.099
they always standard shove that in your

2265.24 --> 2268.5989999999997
face and if you just say yes yeah then

2267.099 --> 2270.46
you're in it right

2268.599 --> 2274.3590000000004
they say Oh They'll know it's what's

2270.46 --> 2275.38
best for me yeah then that's gonna

2274.359 --> 2278.38
happen

2275.38 --> 2281.339
I always avoided it at all costs

2278.38 --> 2284.38
even when I felt really bad I have been

2281.339 --> 2287.32
seduced in mind like maybe I should do

2284.38 --> 2289.119
it I'm so [ __ ] up but I never gave

2287.32 --> 2291.52
into it

2289.119 --> 2293.02
I'm just like nope I'm just gonna sit

2291.52 --> 2295.96
through this

2293.02 --> 2297.7599999999998
that's how through that method and

2295.96 --> 2300.579
that's during my teens that's how I

2297.76 --> 2302.619
learned about the Cycles because I had

2300.579 --> 2305.8
to I had to figure out how am I gonna

2302.619 --> 2308.7400000000002
survive this terrible State of Mind

2305.8 --> 2309.88
well you start by compartmentalizing

2308.74 --> 2311.56
what's happening and use

2309.88 --> 2313.7200000000003
compartmentalize your feelings and you

2311.56 --> 2315.7599999999998
realize my feelings

2313.72 --> 2318.8799999999997
it works in a very specific way and it

2315.76 --> 2321.46
happens like this right now

2318.88 --> 2323.619
and it colors the way I see the world

2321.46 --> 2325.78
and the outlook on the future

2323.619 --> 2328.119
but it's unreasonable and you can

2325.78 --> 2330.579
literally with us with the person in

2328.119 --> 2332.92
that state can literally reason that out

2330.579 --> 2334.8390000000004
and then you'll remind them of why no

2332.92 --> 2336.7000000000003
but no it's actually really good you're

2334.839 --> 2340.54
just not right now

2336.7 --> 2342.04
not capable to receive the power of the

2340.54 --> 2344.14
good moments

2342.04 --> 2347.619
right and that way I compartmentalized

2344.14 --> 2350.92
it and then realized like oh no I'm just

2347.619 --> 2355.119
feeling I'm in a bad state right now

2350.92 --> 2358.839
but I know from experience from paying

2355.119 --> 2362.02
attention keeping track of my state of

2358.839 --> 2363.64
mind and how I feel the messages my

2362.02 --> 2365.98
feelings give me

2363.64 --> 2368.44
because of that I know like oh that's a

2365.98 --> 2370.54
face and the last this long and then oh

2368.44 --> 2371.92
it starts the phase starts it's the

2370.54 --> 2373.3
terrible moment of starting there's

2371.92 --> 2375.16
nothing you can do about you can't

2373.3 --> 2376.3590000000004
struggle you can't try to pretend like

2375.16 --> 2377.74
it doesn't exist because it's gonna

2376.359 --> 2381.7
happen

2377.74 --> 2384.2799999999997
and then you plan for it

2381.7 --> 2386.3799999999997
while you still have control right

2384.28 --> 2389.8
because if you don't you don't plan it

2386.38 --> 2392.5
out then you fall into the deep and then

2389.8 --> 2394.0600000000004
you lose it and then you're like ah help

2392.5 --> 2395.5
me and then you just start nagging

2394.06 --> 2398.7
people help me help me or something

2395.5 --> 2401.74
right that used to happen to me

2398.7 --> 2404.7999999999997
part partially in bad times I don't do

2401.74 --> 2405.8799999999997
that anymore now I'm like oh it's this I

2404.8 --> 2409.54
wait

2405.88 --> 2412.48
this amount of time should like I'm

2409.54 --> 2415.119
literally my own doctor stuttering my

2412.48 --> 2416.98
cycle from a third perspective because

2415.119 --> 2419.44
for some reason even when I feel

2416.98 --> 2422.56
absolutely terrible I still have a lot

2419.44 --> 2424.9
of like good oversight based faculties

2422.56 --> 2427.54
available to me

2424.9 --> 2429.76
right

2427.54 --> 2432.339
my disturbances

2429.76 --> 2435.76
happen in My Cycles

2432.339 --> 2437.7999999999997
mostly with feelings and Impressions not

2435.76 --> 2439.3
with my intellect

2437.8 --> 2442.3590000000004
only thing I really can keep my

2439.3 --> 2447.2200000000003
intellect down is just pure fatigue if I

2442.359 --> 2449.98
haven't slept well if I'm like really

2447.22 --> 2452.5
like really upset about something and I

2449.98 --> 2454.42
can't do anything about it and then that

2452.5 --> 2455.859
that just distracts me and then I can't

2454.42 --> 2458.56
focus

2455.859 --> 2460.42
that sort of thing but overall like even

2458.56 --> 2462.16
if I feel bad I still have a lot of

2460.42 --> 2465.82
high-level faculties available and I've

2462.16 --> 2468.0989999999997
just learned to use that ability

2465.82 --> 2470.56
to manage myself become my own

2468.099 --> 2473.5
psychologist my own caretaker even in

2470.56 --> 2476.2599999999998
the bad times so that I don't become

2473.5 --> 2478.3
dependent on outside

2476.26 --> 2480.28
influence to guide me through those

2478.3 --> 2482.88
moments

2480.28 --> 2482.88
anyway

2484.0 --> 2487.78
sleep of course sleep is extremely

2485.92 --> 2491.2000000000003
important

2487.78 --> 2495.4
but yeah if you are super Restless

2491.2 --> 2497.9199999999996
then that's a real difficult thing to

2495.4 --> 2500.02
basically just do

2497.92 --> 2504.119
right anyway

2573.46 --> 2578.2
a bad moment and you're super restless

2575.44 --> 2579.16
and all that the best thing to do is

2578.2 --> 2583.839
just

2579.16 --> 2586.42
find a pleasant distraction not a

2583.839 --> 2589.48
thrilling distraction

2586.42 --> 2591.94
because all Thrills will make situations

2589.48 --> 2594.48
worse so it's like

2591.94 --> 2594.48
just

2594.52 --> 2601.2599999999998
like Pleasant easy

2598.0 --> 2601.26
move such things right

2603.04 --> 2607.7799999999997
that's a good way to get through it

2605.68 --> 2610.06
but you got to pay attention like not to

2607.78 --> 2611.7400000000002
just forget like oh yeah I am actually

2610.06 --> 2614.2
in a bad spot because you'd want to

2611.74 --> 2616.18
forget naturally it's like oh yes you

2614.2 --> 2617.9199999999996
just want to remember what it's like to

2616.18 --> 2619.48
feel better again but it doesn't mean

2617.92 --> 2622.7200000000003
you are actually

a wisdom Factor Susanna

2660.819 --> 2666.119
right your H is actually kind of

2663.88 --> 2669.76
important in sizing up who somebody is

2666.119 --> 2671.92
based on their energy output because it

2669.76 --> 2673.9
could be that you're very energetic in

you're just really energetic so we're

2835.78 --> 2840.48
I think I'm triggering a whole bunch of

2837.76 --> 2840.48
people there

2841.359 --> 2846.0
I'm kind of just like throwing beef

2843.28 --> 2846.0
jerky around

2846.16 --> 2849.06
metaphorically

2850.06 --> 2855.88
but he said that he would contact me and

2852.76 --> 2858.099
like wanted to do a show together like

2855.88 --> 2860.1400000000003
an elaborate conversation but he then

2858.099 --> 2862.78
didn't contact me I haven't actually

2860.14 --> 2866.02
received any email from him

2862.78 --> 2868.96
and I literally gave the address to him

2866.02 --> 2871.48
and you can find it in every video

2868.96 --> 2873.76
that I make in the description box

2871.48 --> 2875.7
literally without even expanding the

2873.76 --> 2879.599

2875.7 --> 2879.5989999999997
r133 gmail.com

2880.319 --> 2887.579
but maybe he uh

2883.72 --> 2887.5789999999997
changed his mind or something

2897.76 --> 2901.44
got 16 watching

3051.359 --> 3057.54
just immediately pulls me out of like

3055.619 --> 3059.4

a short run

3059.4 --> 3062.48

3110.9 --> 3115.44
I was thinking

3113.16 --> 3117.48
it's not for right now maybe more like

3115.44 --> 3119.28
the summer or Springtime if you're still

3117.48 --> 3122.059
up for it by then

3119.28 --> 3126.9
but how about we do like a really weird

3122.059 --> 3129.5400000000004
skit Together live sometime

3126.9 --> 3132.2400000000002
or get you on the panel with me

3129.54 --> 3135.9
and I do a ball win

3132.24 --> 3138.72
and you do a flat kumu

3135.9 --> 3142.079
you do a flat earther but you do a

3138.72 --> 3144.4199999999996
really serious like I do Bowen

3142.079 --> 3145.92
I want to try that out see what happens

3144.42 --> 3149.96
[Music]

3145.92 --> 3149.96
see if you'll be able to manage

3152.76 --> 3158.7000000000003
right because I'll still be looking at

3155.7 --> 3160.3999999999996
you if you're being a flat earther

3158.7 --> 3165.18
correctly

3160.4 --> 3166.14
and yeah you can judge my bow in if I

3165.18 --> 3170.66
don't

3166.14 --> 3170.66
get too liberal with it

3171.3 --> 3176.1600000000003
to try that out cool not right now

3173.46 --> 3178.76
though because I'm just not it will take

3176.16 --> 3178.7599999999998
a lot of energy

3183.72 --> 3187.98
right so looking forward to trying that

3185.64 --> 3190.92
out sometime

3187.98 --> 3191.7
I'm sure we'll it'll stick to mine I

3190.92 --> 3193.92
mean

3191.7 --> 3196.98
this is a pretty interesting and you I

3193.92 --> 3199.2000000000003
know you can do it you've been the best

3196.98 --> 3202.2
person to actually

3199.2 --> 3206.339
not straw man flat earthers as a baller

3202.2 --> 3209.46
have you guys noticed that akumu

3206.339 --> 3212.4
like he gets messy with technical

3209.46 --> 3213.7200000000003
sometimes right a bit liberal as a

3212.4 --> 3217.619
baller but

3213.72 --> 3219.4199999999996
I mean he doesn't like really always at

3217.619 --> 3221.579
home straw man the [ __ ] out of a pun

3219.42 --> 3223.5
unless you Corner him like Nathan has

3221.579 --> 3225.42
done in the past

3223.5 --> 3227.76
and get really pushy and then he does

3225.42 --> 3229.98
that but he doesn't normally do that

3227.76 --> 3232.7400000000002
he's

3229.98 --> 3234.0
very civil for a baller so if you can do

3232.74 --> 3236.339
that

3234.0 --> 3239.64
then you could probably

3236.339 --> 3241.859
try to emulate a flat earther on a very

3239.64 --> 3243.5989999999997
serious suspense of disbelief level it

3241.859 --> 3245.64
would be acting right

3243.599 --> 3249.2000000000003
character acting

3245.64 --> 3249.2
and I bet you have it in you

3249.42 --> 3251.839
anyway

3255.72 --> 3261.2
this in no Susanna backer that's just

3258.78 --> 3261.2000000000003
his name

3262.319 --> 3267.0589999999997
I don't know he has for some reason he

3264.72 --> 3270.98
chooses like terrible names

3267.059 --> 3270.98
but he's actually kind of a nice guy

3271.5 --> 3275.2
I've known him he's been around for

3273.54 --> 3278.8
years

3275.2 --> 3278.7999999999997
[Music]

3283.079 --> 3288.599
yeah don't don't worry about viruses we

3285.839 --> 3290.819
don't really talk about viruses here

3288.599 --> 3294.1800000000003
because well

3290.819 --> 3298.02
I don't see the point in it it'll just

3294.18 --> 3302.16
draw in legal risk with YouTube and [ __ ]

3298.02 --> 3304.5
right and yeah I don't really believe

3302.16 --> 3305.8799999999997
that viruses are real

3304.5 --> 3308.099
I think they're a science fiction

3305.88 --> 3309.359
construct

3308.099 --> 3311.1600000000003
literally

3309.359 --> 3313.7999999999997
don't think there is any actual

3311.16 --> 3318.24
scientific evidence of the existence of

3313.8 --> 3319.7400000000002
the viral particle and the model that is

3318.24 --> 3323.04
derived

3319.74 --> 3326.04
and used based on that model I don't

3323.04 --> 3328.2
think there's any actual viable evidence

3326.04 --> 3329.359
and I have Alternatives I have

3328.2 --> 3332.339
alternative

3329.359 --> 3335.2799999999997
structural solutions to that

3332.339 --> 3336.42
mostly terrain Theory and German new

3335.28 --> 3339.0
medicine

3336.42 --> 3342.1800000000003
which are very elaborate and completely

3339.0 --> 3344.28
overlooked I mean literally almost

3342.18 --> 3346.44
nobody knows about that

3344.28 --> 3347.8190000000004
although terrain theory has been kind of

3346.44 --> 3349.68
spreading around that's become more

3347.819 --> 3353.16
familiar but Germany medicine is super

3349.68 --> 3355.2
obscure it it almost single-handedly its

3353.16 --> 3357.7799999999997
system just negates the entire medical

3355.2 --> 3360.7799999999997
establishment

3357.78 --> 3365.76
really

3360.78 --> 3368.8390000000004
and it works it worked really well I've

3365.76 --> 3368.8390000000004
I've been using it

3370.319 --> 3374.18
anyway

3371.579 --> 3374.1800000000003
so

3375.9 --> 3381.3
but I'm not afraid of I'm Not Afraid no

3378.78 --> 3383.1600000000003
viruses

3381.3 --> 3384.44
I'm more afraid of ghosts than animal

3383.16 --> 3388.3799999999997
viruses

3384.44 --> 3391.68
and yeah I'm not really afraid of ghosts

3388.38 --> 3394.04
but at least I know that they do kind of

3391.68 --> 3394.04
exist

3394.84 --> 3399.6600000000003
[Music]

3397.02 --> 3403.04
right there's more proof for that than

3399.66 --> 3403.04
there is of actual viruses

3403.8 --> 3406.3390000000004
anyway

3408.11 --> 3411.329
[Music]

3414.66 --> 3417.2
all right

3423.2 --> 3429.0589999999997
oh yeah

3426.3 --> 3431.96
my nails are getting all trashed

3429.059 --> 3431.96
I'll be right back

3449.76 --> 3451.88
okay

3455.96 --> 3459.98
what about Bigfoot

3460.68 --> 3465.319
I think Bigfoot could exist

3470.88 --> 3478.28
but it is a weird thing though

3474.72 --> 3481.14
I mean with all the data available

3478.28 --> 3484.02
including whatever people made up right

3481.14 --> 3486.1189999999997
and they're kooky little stories

3484.02 --> 3489.9
I'd say that

3486.119 --> 3491.6400000000003
if there's such a thing as Bigfoot

3489.9 --> 3494.76
then

3491.64 --> 3497.66
they are basically well they they don't

3494.76 --> 3497.6600000000003
leave bodies

3498.839 --> 3505.619
and I've speculated let's keep walkers

3502.8 --> 3506.96
I've speculated that big food might be

3505.619 --> 3510.54
uh

3506.96 --> 3512.64
partially extra dimensional creature

3510.54 --> 3515.16
which is a very weird thing to say very

3512.64 --> 3517.92
science fiction I understand that

3515.16 --> 3520.98
but I've had weird

3517.92 --> 3523.799
parts of my vision that involved like

3520.98 --> 3528.599
the Sasquatch people

3523.799 --> 3528.599
but yeah people that's right tribes

3530.46 --> 3535.14
it was very weird because I'm not I

3532.5 --> 3537.42
wasn't really into it at all

3535.14 --> 3540.66
but apparently there was this they were

3537.42 --> 3543.7200000000003
they were there and they were like

3540.66 --> 3545.3999999999996
they can like phase out

3543.72 --> 3549.14
they're like

3545.4 --> 3549.14
the yeah plane shifters

3549.299 --> 3553.14
they can just fully physically manifest

3551.64 --> 3555.7799999999997
or they can like

3553.14 --> 3558.0589999999997
phase out

3555.78 --> 3560.2400000000002
and then physically there's no trace of

3558.059 --> 3560.2400000000002
them

3561.48 --> 3565.38
that's what I kind of ended up believing

3564.24 --> 3567.66
about it

3565.38 --> 3570.119
through vision and stories

3567.66 --> 3572.64
but yeah I mean you're not really going

3570.119 --> 3575.52
to find any physical evidence for that

3572.64 --> 3578.46
right unless you're like well

3575.52 --> 3582.059
do terrible things like I'm not even

3578.46 --> 3584.94
gonna roll out like potential ideas on

3582.059 --> 3588.0
like what what you could do to prove it

3584.94 --> 3589.38
is just like no just piss off leave him

3588.0 --> 3592.68
alone

3589.38 --> 3593.88
there's a good reason that they're not

3592.68 --> 3595.48
just

3593.88 --> 3596.76
coming out

3595.48 --> 3600.839
[Music]

3596.76 --> 3602.4
of the cloaks State and just becoming

3600.839 --> 3604.0789999999997
officially

3602.4 --> 3606.359
there

3604.079 --> 3609.299
right I mean

3606.359 --> 3611.2799999999997
they probably don't want to like a gin

3609.299 --> 3616.339
interesting

3611.28 --> 3616.3390000000004
but ajin is an incorporeal being

3618.78 --> 3624.78
like that is like a ghost a spirit a

3622.68 --> 3628.7599999999998
Sasquatch would actually be a physical

3624.78 --> 3628.76
being that can phase up

3628.98 --> 3634.5
like go to the to the Dark World to the

3632.52 --> 3636.44
other to the spirit Dimension like they

3634.5 --> 3638.28
can like dematerialize and

3636.44 --> 3640.859
re-materialize I don't know something

3638.28 --> 3643.8590000000004
like that it's weird

3640.859 --> 3646.98
but that's why they ended up kind of

3643.859 --> 3649.98
like thinking about it not saying like

3646.98 --> 3652.319
oh this is absolutely real must be there

3649.98 --> 3656.339
no I'm not like that

3652.319 --> 3659.18
but I'm not like throwing it in the bin

3656.339 --> 3659.18
just like that

3659.4 --> 3665.2200000000003
think there is a decent

3661.92 --> 3667.44
chance that something like this exists

3665.22 --> 3670.16
I mean the world is actually quite The

3667.44 --> 3670.16
Surreal place

3670.2 --> 3675.299
it's human indoctrination meant to

3673.619 --> 3679.02
protect children

3675.299 --> 3681.0
right to tell us that all that crazy

3679.02 --> 3683.64
things don't exist like that

3681.0 --> 3685.859
right just like oh evil oh it's only

3683.64 --> 3689.64
evil in movies that people don't do that

3685.859 --> 3692.2799999999997
right that's just one layer or what if

3689.64 --> 3694.46
there's like really bizarre things out

3692.28 --> 3694.46
there

3694.859 --> 3703.46
that make Humanity look worse

3698.52 --> 3703.46
than it thinks of itself as right

3706.799 --> 3709.7599999999998
like that anyway

3708.05 --> 3712.7400000000002
[Music]

3709.76 --> 3715.3390000000004
Chinese ghost chances

God

3716.18 --> 3719.66
cloaking fur

3727.079 --> 3729.98
I don't know

3737.16 --> 3742.8799999999997
what if I told you they kind of just

3739.68 --> 3742.8799999999997
look like humans really

3743.04 --> 3746.839
but maybe they can like

3747.059 --> 3753.0
let their hair grow

3749.64 --> 3755.339
because there might be nudists naturally

3753.0 --> 3758.16
like they don't they're like

3755.339 --> 3760.7599999999998
so yeah a bit of hair helps I mean they

3758.16 --> 3764.5789999999997
do apparently

3760.76 --> 3766.7990000000004
materialize in the Wilds

3764.579 --> 3768.8390000000004
so having a bit of hair would be kind of

3766.799 --> 3771.42
convenient but I think that they are

3768.839 --> 3774.5
effectively human

3771.42 --> 3774.5
they're just like

3775.22 --> 3779.839
another sword I don't know

3783.619 --> 3788.7000000000003
at least even according to the claim

3786.0 --> 3792.42
they are humanoid right they they walk

3788.7 --> 3794.339
on two legs have two arms

3792.42 --> 3797.78
and a head

3794.339 --> 3797.7799999999997
of the typical physiology

3799.319 --> 3803.179
anyway

3800.0 --> 3803.179
[Music]

3804.9 --> 3810.319
that's how did we get to this

3807.54 --> 3810.319
just weird

3821.94 --> 3825.98
oh yeah at least she brought up

3829.559 --> 3834.059
could they be descendants of the giant

3832.2 --> 3836.04
race of ancient men

3834.059 --> 3838.619
well have you ever considered that

3836.04 --> 3842.579
everything is

3838.619 --> 3844.26
I've come to like study a new virtual

3842.579 --> 3846.9
model in my mind

3844.26 --> 3848.7000000000003
of how it actually how we're all

3846.9 --> 3851.1600000000003
descendants of God

3848.7 --> 3852.56
and like it just went into different

3851.16 --> 3855.77
directions

3852.56 --> 3855.77
[Music]

3857.94 --> 3861.26
that there's just

3861.42 --> 3866.16
you could think of it as like God the

3864.0 --> 3869.16
Alpha and the Omega outside of time and

3866.16 --> 3871.68
space not the space time

3869.16 --> 3874.74
creating the Elohim the the physical

3871.68 --> 3876.359
manifest like energy they will probably

3874.74 --> 3878.52
Pure Energy

3876.359 --> 3881.0989999999997
and then in their Pure Energy State the

3878.52 --> 3884.4
Elohim designed men

3881.099 --> 3887.4
humans and animals and and all the life

3884.4 --> 3889.559
forms from clay and then the humans kind

3887.4 --> 3892.02
of were the next layer but they were not

3889.559 --> 3893.0400000000004
humans like we were humans like we are

3892.02 --> 3896.339
now

3893.04 --> 3897.7799999999997
and they probably had their well they

3896.339 --> 3900.54
did have Offspring I mean that's even

3897.78 --> 3903.7200000000003
part of the biblical story

3900.54 --> 3907.319
they were basically the sons of God and

3903.72 --> 3910.14
they just it's like every new generation

3907.319 --> 3913.52
after God just makes the Next Generation

3910.14 --> 3913.52
and it's like changes

3914.46 --> 3920.88
so we were all

3916.44 --> 3922.859
descendant from much larger humanoids

3920.88 --> 3926.76
which descended

3922.859 --> 3929.0
from who knows yeah energy beings I

3926.76 --> 3929.0
don't know

3933.119 --> 3938.819
right and I mean in science fiction

3936.0 --> 3942.599
it's very popular to go with the

3938.819 --> 3945.299
evolution story and say like oh yeah no

3942.599 --> 3948.299
we we evolve we evolve spiritually we

3945.299 --> 3950.7599999999998
become smarter and then eventually we

3948.299 --> 3952.859
can Ascend above our Corporal State and

3950.76 --> 3955.26
become energy beings and like that's by

3952.859 --> 3958.5
the way also the philosophy in Babylon

3955.26 --> 3959.7000000000003
5. which I do appreciate that idea I

3958.5 --> 3963.0
mean they took it

3959.7 --> 3966.0
in a good way but I think that it's

3963.0 --> 3968.42
actually the exact reverse of the

3966.0 --> 3968.42
reality

3968.819 --> 3973.98
which is a bit a pessimist Outlook in a

3972.9 --> 3976.5
way

3973.98 --> 3978.18
but I mean we can all deal with it we

3976.5 --> 3979.98
have right

3978.18 --> 3982.799
but I think that it actually started

3979.98 --> 3985.38
with just this magnificent energy beings

3982.799 --> 3987.5389999999998
the Elohim that were created by God the

3985.38 --> 3992.4
the non-being

3987.539 --> 3994.7400000000002
the the one that manifested everything

3992.4 --> 3997.2200000000003
and then the Elohim created

3994.74 --> 4001.5789999999997
Proto man

3997.22 --> 4004.16
giant atom gigantic atom maybe just as

4001.579 --> 4005.3590000000004
big as the entire realm who knows I

4004.16 --> 4008.359
don't know

4005.359 --> 4009.92
who then spawned off other

4008.359 --> 4011.9
men

4009.92 --> 4015.799
and they

4011.9 --> 4018.28
over time like just adapted in different

4015.799 --> 4018.28
ways

4019.76 --> 4024.619
and became smaller

4021.799 --> 4026.9
over like the course of generations like

4024.619 --> 4030.44
keep just gradually growing small and

4026.9 --> 4033.619
then can like a last elastic back a bit

4030.44 --> 4035.599
but never really more than a bump it

4033.619 --> 4038.1800000000003
always goes smaller everybody's just

4035.599 --> 4041.539
growing smaller

4038.18 --> 4044.0
with only bumps to push back a little

4041.539 --> 4045.44
but it never as it never like oh now

4044.0 --> 4046.64
it's going the other way everybody's

4045.44 --> 4050.2400000000002
just getting bigger and bigger and

4046.64 --> 4053.1189999999997
bigger no where's that happening no

4050.24 --> 4055.7
most people that are really large right

4053.119 --> 4059.7400000000002
now have gigantism which is like a

4055.7 --> 4059.74
physical condition that is not viable

4060.2 --> 4062.68
right

4063.2 --> 4069.3999999999996
you don't

4065.2 --> 4069.3999999999996
evolve into bigger

4069.44 --> 4074.599
foreign

4071.44 --> 4077.7200000000003
empirical conclusion

4074.599 --> 4079.3590000000004
so why would we expect

4077.72 --> 4081.9199999999996
it yeah

4079.359 --> 4083.5389999999998
just logical inferences might oh we're

4081.92 --> 4086.2400000000002
getting smaller oh well that means it

4083.539 --> 4089.059
all goes back to

4086.24 --> 4091.5389999999998
the proto-human Giant

4089.059 --> 4091.539
Adam

4092.42 --> 4097.6990000000005
who was created by the

4095.119 --> 4101.12
the first ones the Elohim who were

4097.699 --> 4106.299
manifested by the Almighty

4101.12 --> 4106.299
right I mean it's just a logical system

4108.08 --> 4113.299
definitely I'm not talking about an

4109.88 --> 4116.08
Elohim not the Nephilim

4113.299 --> 4116.08
that's different

4135.14 --> 4137.38
foreign

4146.18 --> 4149.319
[Music]

4163.1 --> 4166.1
okay

4166.88 --> 4171.52
yeah it's not a very good I mean

4174.319 --> 4178.359
is not suitable for schizoids

4180.5 --> 4185.6
it was interesting though I have seen it

4182.9 --> 4188.48
it was kind of interesting but

4185.6 --> 4190.160000000001
I mean it wasn't like great

4188.48 --> 4193.839
it was interesting

4190.16 --> 4193.839
anyway hey Gary Lee benga

4200.12 --> 4205.28
metabolous I don't know doesn't I'm not

4202.28 --> 4207.8
even I'm just going by

4205.28 --> 4209.48
what I see happening even within my

4207.8 --> 4212.719
Lifetime on average

4209.48 --> 4214.36
people small people

4212.719 --> 4217.76
but

4214.36 --> 4221.0
nobody's like having historical records

4217.76 --> 4223.58
of like oh yeah we used to be these tiny

4221.0 --> 4228.1
people but look every generation we just

4223.58 --> 4228.1
become bigger and bigger oh no no

4229.34 --> 4234.5
that's only happened like over the

4231.56 --> 4236.620000000001
course of maybe two generations in

4234.5 --> 4238.88
certain like

4236.62 --> 4240.62
prosperous times

4238.88 --> 4242.659000000001
and suddenly like the food quality

4240.62 --> 4245.12
becomes a lot better or

4242.659 --> 4247.339999999999
just like

4245.12 --> 4249.199
yeah then certainly you have a bit of an

4247.34 --> 4252.56
elastic effect and then you get the up

4249.199 --> 4254.599999999999
bump but it doesn't it's not a it's not

4252.56 --> 4256.64
a hill it doesn't go all the way back to

4254.6 --> 4258.4400000000005
the top as it used to be that doesn't

4256.64 --> 4261.56
happen

4258.44 --> 4264.159
it's just there's no evidence for this

4261.56 --> 4264.159000000001
at all

4266.659 --> 4273.799999999999
John didn't walk this lens right and

4269.84 --> 4276.32
those giants were the men of old

4273.8 --> 4279.02
that's how I kind of see it

4276.32 --> 4283.84
right there are models of an older age

4279.02 --> 4283.84
and they will have compatibility issues

4284.48 --> 4289.879999999999
I mean this world is technically

4286.94 --> 4293.178999999999
becoming more hostile

4289.88 --> 4295.900000000001
it seems like naturally the these

4293.179 --> 4295.9
conditions

4296.719 --> 4302.86
but yeah not like in a global warming

4299.96 --> 4306.7390000000005
way or anything it's just that

4302.86 --> 4307.699
probably used to be a lot more oxygen in

4306.739 --> 4310.159
the air

4307.699 --> 4313.099999999999
and bigger trees everything was bigger

4310.159 --> 4314.12
so there was more so it was easier to be

4313.1 --> 4318.08
big

4314.12 --> 4321.0199999999995
and over time it's just been cut down

4318.08 --> 4324.14
and then smaller and then suddenly the

4321.02 --> 4328.84
conditions to be big becomes harder

4324.14 --> 4328.84
this is a cyclical situation

4334.22 --> 4337.359
[Music]

4347.9 --> 4350.08
thank you

4362.16 --> 4365.29
[Music]

4367.9 --> 4371.129999999999
[Music]

4387.62 --> 4393.199
box would be huge that's scary though no

4390.739 --> 4396.44
that's not

4393.199 --> 4400.0599999999995
why is a huge Buck any scarier than a

4396.44 --> 4400.0599999999995
relatively big wild animal

4400.52 --> 4408.400000000001
I mean yeah they're completely different

4402.62 --> 4408.4
format but bugs have senses too

4416.42 --> 4420.1
some bugs more than others

4423.14 --> 4427.280000000001
I mean there's some people that

4425.179 --> 4430.1
literally keep certain types of beetles

4427.28 --> 4432.86
as pets because you can because they're

4430.1 --> 4436.04
actually kind of smart it's really weird

4432.86 --> 4439.299999999999
right not all bugs are just like

4436.04 --> 4439.3
idiotic and trash

4439.699 --> 4444.199
they're they're

4441.32 --> 4446.719
designed by God just the same and so

4444.199 --> 4451.219
they have that original potential which

4446.719 --> 4454.04
is way beyond our understanding

4451.219 --> 4455.44
and I think every creature has that

4454.04 --> 4457.58
potential

4455.44 --> 4460.639999999999
[Music]

4457.58 --> 4462.98
it's like don't downplay what it is

4460.64 --> 4465.5
because that's like downplaying God's

4462.98 --> 4467.36
design capability it's like oh oh you

4465.5 --> 4469.699
think that that is just stupid there's

4467.36 --> 4471.5599999999995
just this no maybe you just think that

4469.699 --> 4473.07
from your perspective because you want

4471.56 --> 4474.320000000001
to feel so much better

4473.07 --> 4477.5
[Music]

4474.32 --> 4478.83
that's probably what that is

4477.5 --> 4483.14
anyway

4478.83 --> 4483.14
[Music]

4485.179 --> 4488.179
foreign

4490.49 --> 4494.659
[Music]

4492.159 --> 4495.739
who knows hello by the way good to see

4494.659 --> 4499.0
you

4495.739 --> 4499.0
I mean I'm

4499.159 --> 4505.82
I mean I could imagine how there could

4502.34 --> 4507.92
be giants still but they would have to

4505.82 --> 4510.32
be

4507.92 --> 4512.6
well in a way technologically advanced

4510.32 --> 4514.699
as well in order to just be able to

4512.6 --> 4516.860000000001
sustain themselves

4514.699 --> 4519.678999999999
like maybe they have like a higher

4516.86 --> 4521.48
pressurized environment Subterranean or

4519.679 --> 4524.42
something

4521.48 --> 4527.839999999999
that would make it more viable for them

4524.42 --> 4530.02
to survive there right something like

4527.84 --> 4530.02
that

4530.84 --> 4537.219
because out in the open is not going to

4533.06 --> 4537.219
be very pleasant to them I I believe

4539.54 --> 4544.1
it's like oh this is like oh it's just

4541.52 --> 4546.02
thin Atmos it's like for them

4544.1 --> 4548.2390000000005
I could imagine if they're really giants

4546.02 --> 4551.120000000001
like 20 meters and such and they're

4548.239 --> 4554.48
still out there that getting out to the

4551.12 --> 4557.0599999999995
surface might be experienced just like a

4554.48 --> 4559.339999999999
human getting up a really really high

4557.06 --> 4563.2390000000005
mountain like it's like

4559.34 --> 4566.7390000000005
ah this is not good right like that I

4563.239 --> 4566.739
think it would be to them like that

4568.28 --> 4573.0199999999995
it's like the air is too thin

4570.56 --> 4576.159000000001
it's not healthy

4573.02 --> 4576.159000000001
that's what I think

4579.739 --> 4585.62
right maybe they'll eventually like come

4582.38 --> 4587.36
out in gigantic pressurized suits could

4585.62 --> 4590.84
you imagine that

4587.36 --> 4593.719
20 meter tall humanoids in like sci-fi

4590.84 --> 4596.0
looking spacesuits not astronaut suit

4593.719 --> 4599.179
but it's like pressurized suits well

4596.0 --> 4602.42
they have like helmets and like

4599.179 --> 4605.26
like gigantic 20 meter tall Darth Vaders

4602.42 --> 4605.26
sort of

4607.52 --> 4614.3
they might come and show up one day guys

4610.46 --> 4616.52
if these circumstances are right

4614.3 --> 4619.54
right

4616.52 --> 4619.540000000001
never really know

4620.12 --> 4625.5199999999995
I mean if they did show up like that

4622.34 --> 4626.900000000001
they'll probably be classified as Alien

4625.52 --> 4629.5
Invaders

4626.9 --> 4629.5
right

4633.739 --> 4640.5199999999995
unless this just this government devil

4638.54 --> 4642.98
spirit

4640.52 --> 4645.5
is extinguished somehow

4642.98 --> 4648.199
I mean maybe if we like defeat this

4645.5 --> 4651.86
Spirit of Satan in this case that is

4648.199 --> 4654.259999999999
ruling this world with its lies and its

4651.86 --> 4657.259999999999
manipulations if that is defeated then

4654.26 --> 4659.719
literally all kinds of beings might just

4657.26 --> 4661.219
suddenly come out of the Shadows but

4659.719 --> 4664.159
that's only going to work when it's

4661.219 --> 4666.32
actually defeated and not just oh we won

4664.159 --> 4669.739
this time oh they have to retreat them

4666.32 --> 4673.88
now they have to like be defeated

4669.739 --> 4676.699
like really snuffed out roots dug out

4673.88 --> 4680.12
until it's all gone and then suddenly

4676.699 --> 4683.178999999999
like oh big feat Society might certainly

4680.12 --> 4686.48
show up oh there's the Giants from

4683.179 --> 4689.3
from the North Pole in their pressurized

4686.48 --> 4693.0199999999995
suits they come and show dude the blue

4689.3 --> 4695.06
people might just show up come walking

4693.02 --> 4696.92
out of the ocean in their submarine

4695.06 --> 4699.56
craft all of a sudden from Antarctica

4696.92 --> 4702.08
who knows man what would happen

4699.56 --> 4703.76
but in this environment the way things

4702.08 --> 4705.159
are with the government the way they

4703.76 --> 4707.06
operate

4705.159 --> 4708.86
psychologically attacking everything

4707.06 --> 4711.56
there's no way they could make an

4708.86 --> 4714.5
appearance without becoming

4711.56 --> 4718.580000000001
like the stamp the arch enemy of

4714.5 --> 4720.26
humanity for not being regular

4718.58 --> 4723.14
humans

4720.26 --> 4724.76
right

4723.14 --> 4727.64
I mean

4724.76 --> 4731.02
what else would they do but declare them

4727.64 --> 4731.02
Alien Invaders or something

4731.42 --> 4733.84
anyway

4737.3 --> 4742.58
not making any clue yeah there's stories

4739.88 --> 4744.82
and I I like the idea too so I have a

4742.58 --> 4744.82
personal

4746.06 --> 4749.96
want it's like I would like that to be

4748.88 --> 4752.3
the case

4749.96 --> 4755.9800000000005
might not be they might all be extinct

4752.3 --> 4755.9800000000005
and that would make me really sad

4761.239 --> 4766.4
but I hope they aren't I hope there's

4763.52 --> 4768.080000000001
still a lot of bizarre creatures that

4766.4 --> 4770.659
are just not compatible with today's

4768.08 --> 4773.239
society

4770.659 --> 4775.839999999999
that have survived on their own and

4773.239 --> 4779.0599999999995
hopefully even thriving to the degree

4775.84 --> 4781.76
that they just like okay let's just let

4779.06 --> 4784.34
this human world faster

4781.76 --> 4787.52
it's heading to a head right it's

4784.34 --> 4788.900000000001
getting to a peak Caligula stage is

4787.52 --> 4791.96
arriving

4788.9 --> 4793.5199999999995
and then it should end just like as

4791.96 --> 4795.38
always has and then maybe they could

4793.52 --> 4797.179
come back out of the Shadows it's like

4795.38 --> 4800.42
another Age of Wonders it's like what

4797.179 --> 4802.04
all these things existed yeah we

4800.42 --> 4804.62
couldn't come out of the Shadows because

4802.04 --> 4807.199
the empire was there it was going to

4804.62 --> 4809.239
destroy us we're just trying to survive

4807.199 --> 4811.839999999999
as a species here

4809.239 --> 4811.839999999999
right

4813.08 --> 4818.239
who knows what can happen

4815.78 --> 4823.36
really looking forward to that I hope I

4818.239 --> 4823.36
lived to see such period of time

4828.219 --> 4833.02
it would be absolutely Epic

4833.06 --> 4839.179
to like

4835.46 --> 4842.179
shake the finger of a giant

4839.179 --> 4843.92
with my hand that would be so epic if I

4842.179 --> 4845.12
would have that moment in my life

4843.92 --> 4847.34
somewhere

4845.12 --> 4849.699
and it was physically real

4847.34 --> 4851.659000000001
not just the vision

4849.699 --> 4853.4
anyway I'm going to take a two minute

4851.659 --> 4856.0599999999995
break be right back hope you're all

4853.4 --> 4856.0599999999995
enjoying the show

4892.1 --> 4894.76
foreign

4922.76 --> 4925.42
foreign

4952.159 --> 4955.159
foreign

4967.12 --> 4970.94
be able to swim

4969.739 --> 4973.419999999999
yeah

4970.94 --> 4973.419999999999
of course

4983.6 --> 4989.2390000000005
I mean

4986.179 --> 4992.719
easy I mean a whale

4989.239 --> 4995.239
you know a whale can very easily swim

4992.719 --> 4999.02
around it's massive

4995.239 --> 5000.339999999999
like it has more trouble not being in

4999.02 --> 5002.4400000000005
the water

5000.34 --> 5004.900000000001
because of the crushing of its own

5002.44 --> 5006.04
weight right Giant's gonna have the same

5004.9 --> 5008.799999999999
issue

5006.04 --> 5011.88
they're gonna get around a lot easier

5008.8 --> 5011.88
swimming actually

5012.58 --> 5018.5199999999995
right I mean it's even for humans I mean

5016.14 --> 5020.9800000000005
therapeutical bathing

5018.52 --> 5023.56
you go sit in really salty water and

5020.98 --> 5027.82
just let yourself float because you

5023.56 --> 5029.7390000000005
become less impacted by your own weight

5027.82 --> 5032.259999999999
right relative density surrounding

5029.739 --> 5034.5599999999995
yourself with a more dense medium

5032.26 --> 5037.92
so there's less this equilibrium Force

5034.56 --> 5037.92
pushing on you

5037.96 --> 5042.34
that's gonna work the same for Giants in

5040.78 --> 5044.199
the ocean

5042.34 --> 5046.3
it's going to be easier I mean they're

5044.199 --> 5051.12
still gonna like

5046.3 --> 5051.12
yeah you anyway you get it

5056.739 --> 5060.28
joints yeah no you're thinking of Titan

5059.44 --> 5062.98
size

5060.28 --> 5065.739
when I talk about Giants in general I'm

5062.98 --> 5069.78
in my mind it's like 20 meters

5065.739 --> 5069.78
which is already freaking huge okay

5070.9 --> 5078.46
anything like below that

5074.38 --> 5081.9400000000005
like anything like up to three meters

5078.46 --> 5084.1
is more like a half Giant

5081.94 --> 5087.5199999999995
in between

5084.1 --> 5090.6990000000005
like after the

5087.52 --> 5094.860000000001
original Giants from Atlantis started

5090.699 --> 5094.86
mixing with humans to survive

5095.739 --> 5099.12
after the cataclysm

5106.239 --> 5109.178999999999
all right you're probably thinking of

5107.8 --> 5110.64
Titans

5109.179 --> 5115.5
like

5110.64 --> 5115.5
Godzilla sized Giants

5122.56 --> 5128.14
and they may might have existed too

5124.659 --> 5129.699
before that time I mean Adam was

5128.14 --> 5133.4800000000005
probably like

5129.699 --> 5136.199
the original Titan gigantic Beyond

5133.48 --> 5136.199
imagination

5136.42 --> 5143.76
that's what I think at least

5138.219 --> 5143.76
but according to the logical inference

5145.84 --> 5150.04
right but in that time the entire

5148.48 --> 5151.659
environment must have been very

5150.04 --> 5153.5199999999995
different I mean

5151.659 --> 5156.339999999999
there's a good chance that Adam just

5153.52 --> 5160.2390000000005
literally started out in this realm and

5156.34 --> 5163.4800000000005
the realm was eaten and to scale of how

5160.239 --> 5165.5199999999995
how large he was

5163.48 --> 5167.44
the whole place was probably a lot

5165.52 --> 5170.8
smaller

5167.44 --> 5173.08
from his perspective like because he's

5170.8 --> 5176.679
so large

5173.08 --> 5179.26
a much smaller like a bubble some or

5176.679 --> 5182.4400000000005
whatever however a box looping I don't

5179.26 --> 5183.9400000000005
know right it would have been huge and

5182.44 --> 5186.339999999999
like in a big garden with just

5183.94 --> 5188.86
everything huge huge trees huge animals

5186.34 --> 5190.659000000001
but not a lot of room

5188.86 --> 5194.62
and then

5190.659 --> 5197.94
things are changed and symbolized as

5194.62 --> 5197.94
being thrown out of paradise

5198.34 --> 5202.1990000000005
and probably scaled down

5203.32 --> 5207.82
like

5204.76 --> 5209.7390000000005
he was thrown out of that place started

5207.82 --> 5212.139
to procreate his kids would have been

5209.739 --> 5213.879999999999
all like half his size

5212.139 --> 5217.84
and their kids would have been half

5213.88 --> 5221.58
their sizes Etc right real they would

5217.84 --> 5221.58
still live like insanely long

5222.159 --> 5229.199
when every new generation just smaller

5225.34 --> 5229.1990000000005
and slightly shorter lived

5232.679 --> 5240.52
yeah no [ __ ] Google virus grows

5237.239 --> 5242.5599999999995
that was freaking nightmarish

5240.52 --> 5245.6990000000005
but those are not Giants those are like

5242.56 --> 5249.34
weird flesh constructs

5245.699 --> 5251.5
it's really [ __ ] up more like humanoid

5249.34 --> 5256.08
amoebas

5251.5 --> 5256.08
let's freaking Attack on Titan Giants

5260.15 --> 5263.92
[Music]

5268.26 --> 5277.0
I heard that Godzilla Godzilla

5272.62 --> 5279.58
you're talking Godzilla I said Godzilla

5277.0 --> 5283.38
not Godzilla I think Godzilla is just

5279.58 --> 5283.38
regular size really

5283.84 --> 5290.400000000001
foreign

5286.139 --> 5290.400000000001
seven feet two inches not bad

5291.72 --> 5294.859
[Music]

5297.219 --> 5302.52

5300.04 --> 5302.5199999999995
Grappler

5306.1 --> 5311.46
well that explains a few things

5308.62 --> 5311.46
Godzilla

5315.28 --> 5321.82
I'm joking but it actually does

5318.82 --> 5321.82
foreign

5325.13 --> 5328.31
[Music]

5330.46 --> 5338.219
do you think there ever was a race of

5333.58 --> 5338.219
very very tiny people yeah we're in

5343.6 --> 5347.88
I think we're the very very tiny people

5352.0 --> 5357.9
regular humans

5354.219 --> 5357.9
I think we're the tiny people

5358.42 --> 5365.86
but since we don't see huge humanoids

5362.679 --> 5367.659
around us we think of us as being pretty

5365.86 --> 5370.0599999999995
large

5367.659 --> 5372.4
and humans have hunted down a lot of big

5370.06 --> 5374.26
creatures

5372.4 --> 5376.839999999999
right I mean just look at what we do

5374.26 --> 5379.179
with the freaking dogs

5376.84 --> 5382.96
turning them into these weird little

5379.179 --> 5386.4400000000005
freaks why because then we seem so big

5382.96 --> 5390.699
we're so big look at the little doggy we

5386.44 --> 5393.339999999999
so big ooh we're so big

5390.699 --> 5395.5599999999995
I mean that's the reason why we're just

5393.34 --> 5398.639
mutating these dogs into like these

5395.56 --> 5398.639
little guppies

5399.34 --> 5403.6
so that you feel big

5402.28 --> 5406.96
yeah

5403.6 --> 5409.120000000001
we're not big we're actually very tiny

5406.96 --> 5410.9800000000005
we're probably the tiniest humanoid

5409.12 --> 5414.34
species that has

5410.98 --> 5416.699
been thus far I mean it's probably not

5414.34 --> 5416.6990000000005
the end

5417.78 --> 5422.49
it's still gonna get smaller over like

5420.46 --> 5425.6
the next hundred years

5422.49 --> 5425.599999999999
[Music]

5426.78 --> 5433.239
especially with all this weird medical

5429.84 --> 5435.84
experimentation then we know very very

5433.239 --> 5435.839999999999
little about

5436.36 --> 5438.9
anyway

5446.26 --> 5451.6
five foot eleven

5448.96 --> 5454.2390000000005
all right oh you're a little taller than

5451.6 --> 5458.320000000001
me damn it

5454.239 --> 5461.4
still explains a few things though

5458.32 --> 5461.4
no it doesn't really

5462.58 --> 5469.38
I hate freaking feeding stuff I always

5466.0 --> 5469.38
get it wrong it makes no sense

5475.0 --> 5480.659
no I'm so I think translated I'm like

5477.88 --> 5480.659000000001
five foot seven

5485.62 --> 5491.159
but I am Asian genetically challenged

5488.739 --> 5491.159
like that

5492.04 --> 5495.9
even though it's a very tiny part

5501.1 --> 5506.26
although that's not entirely fair I mean

5504.1 --> 5509.4400000000005
like even my grandmother and my mother

5506.26 --> 5513.6990000000005
who had absolutely no Asian genetics

5509.44 --> 5517.199
whatsoever they were also tiny damn it

5513.699 --> 5517.199
it will probably Grabbers

21.5 Romans

5568.98 --> 5574.9
it's okay

5571.42 --> 5577.84
it's not really proper talk for this

5574.9 --> 5580.299999999999
show Tony Whitcomb

5577.84 --> 5583.659000000001
but I get it that's funny

5580.3 --> 5583.659000000001
no no

5583.719 --> 5589.659
I'm kind of not doing that anymore

5586.84 --> 5592.6
because the last few times that I have I

5589.659 --> 5594.5199999999995
would like get sick from it

5592.6 --> 5596.7390000000005
because of the tension or something it's

5594.52 --> 5601.0
like I'm not

5596.739 --> 5604.44
taking food very well in the morning

5601.0 --> 5604.44
thus far this winter

5605.86 --> 5610.0599999999995
so the first thing I actually eat are

5608.199 --> 5611.379999999999
well supplements which is not really

5610.06 --> 5613.2390000000005
food

5611.38 --> 5615.1
and then

5613.239 --> 5617.62
lunch

5615.1 --> 5620.56
my lunch is basically my breakfast and I

5617.62 --> 5622.48
get it after the show

5620.56 --> 5624.1
it's better to be a little hungry during

5622.48 --> 5627.339999999999
the show

5624.1 --> 5630.84
that's what I've noticed

5627.34 --> 5630.84
it helps to focus

5635.32 --> 5640.799999999999
right and besides they don't have money

5637.239 --> 5640.799999999999
for Illuminati croissants

5641.98 --> 5647.08
I just like it is a luxury item

5645.94 --> 5650.5599999999995
in fact

5647.08 --> 5654.0
that's like a food snack thing it does

5650.56 --> 5656.26
when I take it it is part of the diet

5654.0 --> 5659.44
but I don't have money for that [ __ ]

5656.26 --> 5663.52
right now I'm just trying to get about

5659.44 --> 5666.12
and like get basic staple food and make

5663.52 --> 5666.120000000001
sure that

5667.84 --> 5671.1
I don't run out

5767.62 --> 5771.729
[Music]

5775.239 --> 5781.0
it's more seasoned for like

5778.719 --> 5783.28
kale

5781.0 --> 5784.78
and Blood Washed

5837.52 --> 5841.659000000001
though

5839.38 --> 5843.6990000000005
but it's because like I don't eat bacon

5841.659 --> 5847.599999999999
anymore and don't put on the IP without

5843.699 --> 5851.099999999999
bacon is kind of like ill I don't like

5847.6 --> 5851.1
it anymore without bacon

5854.199 --> 5857.159
I was anxious

5865.12 --> 5869.46
okay now I'm making myself really hungry

5876.06 --> 5883.620000000001
stewed steak crazy chips fried egg wow

5880.6 --> 5883.620000000001

5912.04 --> 5916.86
bacon bio

5914.199 --> 5916.86
no

5917.32 --> 5923.139
I don't want meat replacement let's

5920.44 --> 5925.599999999999
completely gross

5923.139 --> 5927.9400000000005
I just don't eat

5925.6 --> 5930.400000000001
like Pig anymore

5927.94 --> 5933.4
for a long time

5930.4 --> 5933.4
2006.

5949.719 --> 5954.78
no akumo virus

5951.88 --> 5958.32
no that would be an absolutely

5954.78 --> 5958.32
ridiculous notion

5958.54 --> 5962.26
because they were a good source of food

5960.58 --> 5964.84
like

5962.26 --> 5967.179
you obviously know absolutely nothing

5964.84 --> 5971.679
about meat

5967.179 --> 5974.26
because the main problem even with meat

5971.679 --> 5975.82
is that if you just like kill a large

5974.26 --> 5977.08
animal

5975.82 --> 5979.239
what are you gonna do with that

5977.08 --> 5981.34
especially in ancient times when there

5979.239 --> 5984.218999999999
weren't any refrigerators what you're

5981.34 --> 5987.34
gonna drag that corpse all the way

5984.219 --> 5989.38
to like high on top of a mountain where

5987.34 --> 5990.639
it's cold enough or something like

5989.38 --> 5993.76
I mean

5990.639 --> 5995.4400000000005
a giant what you're gonna Slaughter it

5993.76 --> 5998.8
while it's still alive and take it bit

5995.44 --> 6001.0199999999995
by bit that is super brutal

5998.8 --> 6003.659000000001
otherwise it's like oh kill the giant

6001.02 --> 6005.46
then what cut him up and how are you

6003.659 --> 6009.299999999999
gonna prevent like

6005.46 --> 6012.26
most of that meat from just rotting away

6009.3 --> 6012.26
it's ridiculous

6015.719 --> 6020.54
no

6017.46 --> 6020.54
just know

6021.42 --> 6027.02
the opposite however is much more likely

6023.82 --> 6030.179
and even described in in biblical text

6027.02 --> 6033.96
even though Norm Canon whatever

6030.179 --> 6037.4400000000005
Nicene Council can bite it right

6033.96 --> 6040.7390000000005
like yeah the Giants they lost it and

6037.44 --> 6043.219
then they just started eating people

6040.739 --> 6043.218999999999
right

6045.13 --> 6050.28
[Music]

6047.719 --> 6053.12
the other way around is absolutely

6050.28 --> 6053.12
preposterous

6055.38 --> 6060.26
the thoughts are and you're a creep a

6057.6 --> 6063.499000000001
gumo virus you're being really creepy

6068.6 --> 6073.1990000000005
lots of salt

6071.28 --> 6075.92
dude where the hell are you gonna get

6073.199 --> 6075.919999999999
all that salt

6081.12 --> 6086.04
I mean

6082.5 --> 6089.04
maybe near Israel or something maybe you

6086.04 --> 6091.44
could use the Dead Sea as like a

6089.04 --> 6093.54
a salting pool you just like drag the

6091.44 --> 6094.919999999999
Giant in there and just like let the

6093.54 --> 6097.38
salt just

6094.92 --> 6100.26
solve it up and then

6097.38 --> 6102.02
every now and then like drag a piece out

6100.26 --> 6106.1
but I

6102.02 --> 6106.1
no just no

6106.199 --> 6108.919999999999
I mean

6109.139 --> 6113.119
it no it is

6119.1 --> 6122.42
into salt lines

6126.719 --> 6132.42
it's messed up I don't think

6129.54 --> 6134.46
I don't yeah no I mean I don't think

6132.42 --> 6138.06
even the Phoenicians would go that far

6134.46 --> 6141.06
although yeah I mean to assign some kind

6138.06 --> 6143.219
of moral limit to where they would go is

6141.06 --> 6146.52
kind of futile overall

6143.219 --> 6150.199
but I mean ridiculous akumu virus is

6146.52 --> 6150.1990000000005
just ridiculous stop it

6154.02 --> 6160.88
yeah I'm not loving it I think it's

6155.94 --> 6160.879999999999
gross and dark and unnecessary

6161.159 --> 6163.699
foreign

6173.76 --> 6176.76
Casey

6188.1 --> 6193.5
client base is kind of pushed

6190.44 --> 6195.78
or they want it Susanna but it's [ __ ]

6193.5 --> 6198.08
gross and it's not good for you A lot of

6195.78 --> 6198.08
the time

6207.1 --> 6210.35
[Music]

6226.5 --> 6230.58
yeah

6227.76 --> 6234.42
now the issue is like

6230.58 --> 6238.0199999999995
you can do so much with meat and an

6234.42 --> 6239.58
animal like not just the meat everything

6238.02 --> 6242.360000000001
bones

6239.58 --> 6242.36
organs

6242.4 --> 6248.839999999999
like

6243.84 --> 6248.84
everything can be used for something

6254.46 --> 6259.08
you can do much more with just one

6256.739 --> 6261.119
animal if you have a proper industry to

6259.08 --> 6264.0
back it all up

6261.119 --> 6266.28
to use it in different ways then you

6264.0 --> 6270.32
could even like achieve trying to

6266.28 --> 6270.32
replace all those functions with plants

6273.06 --> 6277.320000000001
I mean you're not gonna make a

6275.1 --> 6279.9800000000005
plant-based leather replacement there's

6277.32 --> 6279.98
just no

6288.42 --> 6292.76
or like collagen

6290.639 --> 6294.96
I mean right

6292.76 --> 6297.360000000001
non-animal collagen

6294.96 --> 6299.219
okay

6297.36 --> 6300.41
are you curious to see how you're gonna

6299.219 --> 6303.62
tackle that

6300.41 --> 6303.62
[Music]

6307.94 --> 6314.438999999999
[Music]

6316.739 --> 6322.199
okay yeah good luck with that tour Casey

6319.199 --> 6322.199
interesting

6330.76 --> 6334.339
[Music]

6336.06 --> 6341.820000000001
to receive made leather from a seaweed's

6339.84 --> 6345.54
web

6341.82 --> 6349.259999999999
what how the hell does that work

6345.54 --> 6351.84
I mean that no

6349.26 --> 6354.2390000000005
what

6351.84 --> 6356.96
how is that leather

6354.239 --> 6356.959999999999
weird

6369.06 --> 6374.179
I mean there's some

6370.86 --> 6378.42
tough fibers among seaweeds probably

6374.179 --> 6381.679
right but that's still cloth I mean it's

6378.42 --> 6381.679
not gonna be like leather

6393.659 --> 6397.04
and you misunderstood

6398.04 --> 6406.44
okay but I don't really get it

6401.88 --> 6408.54
leather from seaweed that I mean

6406.44 --> 6411.419999999999
I take it you didn't mean they use

6408.54 --> 6412.5
seaweed as a component in making leather

6411.42 --> 6415.26
Maybe

6412.5 --> 6417.5
but like otherwise it just makes no

6415.26 --> 6417.5
sense

6417.659 --> 6420.98
coloring all right right

6421.02 --> 6424.619000000001
yeah that makes more sense I mean

6422.46 --> 6428.159
there's all kinds of in tanning is a

6424.619 --> 6431.839999999999
very bizarre interesting profession

6428.159 --> 6431.839999999999
it's all kinds of things they do with it

6442.17 --> 6448.219

6443.52 --> 6448.219
Jesus let's see that's dark

6449.219 --> 6451.46
foreign

6459.139 --> 6463.26
of course plants are involved Susanna

6462.179 --> 6465.119
come on

6463.26 --> 6467.46
no there are plants involved I never

6465.119 --> 6469.259999999999
said that oh you you don't need plants

6467.46 --> 6473.1
anymore

6469.26 --> 6475.92
yeah it's like a fanatical

6473.1 --> 6478.26
meat eater it's like no we can't use

6475.92 --> 6482.219
plant-based products anywhere only

6478.26 --> 6485.46
animals it's like what that's gonna be

6482.219 --> 6489.38
even tougher I mean you're gonna need

6485.46 --> 6489.38
plants for processing

6489.6 --> 6493.6990000000005
like animal based things

6504.32 --> 6510.599999999999
okay all the food talk you're making it

6507.179 --> 6512.88
kind of tough on me Thor Casey

6510.6 --> 6516.679
although yeah at least G's message is

6512.88 --> 6516.679
definitely compensates for that

6517.01 --> 6520.079000000001
[Music]

6528.6 --> 6531.6
foreign

6550.32 --> 6554.48
right so I'm gonna round out the show

6552.239 --> 6554.48
soon

6555.42 --> 6564.38
and I'd still like to ask for PayPal

6558.44 --> 6564.379999999999
support I got a little from uh

6570.6 --> 6576.54
price of Adam earlier I could really use

6573.48 --> 6580.0199999999995
some more if anybody could

6576.54 --> 6582.54
so please please still yeah donate some

6580.02 --> 6584.9400000000005
to my PayPal if you're watching now and

6582.54 --> 6587.34
you weren't there at that earlier

6584.94 --> 6588.9
section of the show I hope it's been a

6587.34 --> 6591.119000000001
very entertaining show I certainly

6588.9 --> 6592.5599999999995
enjoyed myself

6591.119 --> 6595.08
and

6592.56 --> 6598.820000000001
once the chat got going it it was

6595.08 --> 6598.82
interesting all over the place

6601.02 --> 6606.619000000001
it's interesting just talking about the

6603.78 --> 6606.619
Giants and

6608.159 --> 6612.92
where did we come from how does that

6610.56 --> 6612.92
work

6613.98 --> 6620.339999999999
logical inference versus story structure

6618.3 --> 6623.9400000000005
that has been handed down through

6620.34 --> 6627.679
tradition right that is a lot of what we

6623.94 --> 6627.678999999999
were actually talking about here today

6632.1 --> 6635.1
okay

6638.28 --> 6640.94
huh

6659.159 --> 6664.32
right so anyway please donate to my

6661.8 --> 6667.04
PayPal I thought it was kind of worth it

6664.32 --> 6669.54
been doing a lot of Performing recently

6667.04 --> 6671.94
like now

6669.54 --> 6674.4
doing my ball win thing on flat side I'm

6671.94 --> 6677.879999999999
probably gonna do that a lot more flat

6674.4 --> 6680.46
sword seems very receptive to it not

6677.88 --> 6683.159000000001
getting super triggered over it I see

6680.46 --> 6684.78
him literally laugh

6683.159 --> 6688.199
when I do that

6684.78 --> 6690.84
on camera through YouTube so yeah

6688.199 --> 6693.54
I'm going to do that more often probably

6690.84 --> 6696.0
and spice up the place a bit

6693.54 --> 6697.92
so yeah that's just another thing that

6696.0 --> 6701.48
I'm doing right now

6697.92 --> 6701.4800000000005
with my online presence

and I hope you're all enjoying it and

and all that but still I mean the advice
