2.389 --> 9.059
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

5.82 --> 15.809000000000001
early-bird number 27 I'm your host

9.059 --> 16.769
Arwen yes it's much colder than

15.809 --> 21.439999999999998
yesterday

16.769 --> 23.939
I have no guests yet though

21.44 --> 29.310000000000002
shirtless flat earther said he had

23.939 --> 31.698999999999998
interested come on and yeah he doesn't

29.31 --> 35.789
use Skype so that's gonna be difficult

31.699 --> 38.519000000000005
never had much success actually adding

35.789 --> 43.739000000000004
people through Google hangout so far

38.519 --> 45.899
because yeah you type in any name but it

43.739 --> 48.449
just doesn't find them for some reason I

45.899 --> 50.459
don't know really how that works not

48.449 --> 53.789
really I don't understand that the group

50.459 --> 58.289
will hangouts social networking system

53.789 --> 60.959
at all it's very confusing that's why I

58.289 --> 66.02
just use Skype it's much more

60.959 --> 71.34
straightforward also considering maybe

66.02 --> 73.74
getting what's app that's that yeah I

71.34 --> 76.71000000000001
talked about that earlier that that that

73.74 --> 80.69999999999999
thing is actually what people use in the

76.71 --> 88.13
Netherlands what's app a lot everyone I

80.7 --> 90.99000000000001
meet here uses it and it's apparently a

88.13 --> 94.259
derivative from Skype itself it's from

90.99 --> 95.81
the same makers same group so yeah it

94.259 --> 99.749
might be a good alternative

95.81 --> 105.95
communication platform so I might try it

99.749 --> 113.06899999999999
out and very easy to get that apparently

105.95 --> 122.369
so anyway is everyone doing it's low

113.069 --> 126.659
activity chat Thorson Nicholas sure just

122.369 --> 133.53
let earth of course Nathan pop by flat

126.659 --> 135.769
ball I'll be Shane hammock good morning

133.53 --> 135.769
everyone

136.31 --> 145.01
it's cold though it's not terribly cold

143.82 --> 148.04999999999998
but yes

145.01 --> 150.92
yesterday was a miracle day it's really

148.05 --> 153.69
nice now yeah

150.92 --> 167.1
raining again as well here and there of

153.69 --> 171.95
course Wednesday we really need to

167.1 --> 171.95
gather my thoughts at all over the place

178.25 --> 187.68
what did happen yesterday again worth

182.73 --> 191.25
the same I think although I think maybe

187.68 --> 194.239
if you heard the the after show from

191.25 --> 205.29
Nathan I got pretty pissed off with

194.239 --> 208.08
unbearable Laurie guy but yeah he is he

205.29 --> 212.07
is exactly like one of the worst chat

208.08 --> 216.06
trolls but he actually enacted with his

212.07 --> 221.43
voice and he is very persistent it is

216.06 --> 227.58
just totally useless very in very

221.43 --> 230.73000000000002
annoying person the and Allenby also has

227.58 --> 233.37
this annoying sights but at least you

230.73 --> 237.56
can actually have a normal conversation

233.37 --> 237.56
with it at at times

259.23 --> 261.95000000000005
yeah

262.85 --> 268.58000000000004
well I guess what I've been thinking

265.58 --> 274.41999999999996
about the last times the last few days

268.58 --> 278.18
the most is just I guess especially

274.42 --> 281.57
Martin it gives work and just thinking

278.18 --> 286.21
about it like yeah you're digging that

281.57 --> 289.48
stuff up how far are you gonna go like

286.21 --> 292.34
what you could potentially discover and

289.48 --> 298.07
our far you're willing to go do you

292.34 --> 300.46999999999997
realize what you are and what you could

298.07 --> 302.63
be unveiling there I think you already

300.47 --> 305.11
get the feel for it with the fashions

302.63 --> 309.89
and everything but that stuff could be

305.11 --> 313.37
more dangerous than we know in the sense

309.89 --> 315.96999999999997
that there is a great group of people

313.37 --> 319.97
out there that do know what it does and

315.97 --> 325.99
that's why it's not really allowed to be

319.97 --> 328.46000000000004
known so I guess that just the

325.99 --> 332.33
historical references to the thing is

328.46 --> 335.78
very fascinating but should be very

332.33 --> 339.31
careful with deepening the knowledge in

335.78 --> 345.5
this stuff in public that that's just my

339.31 --> 348.38
my personal opinion based on my

345.5 --> 354.02
oversight so Martin Lathika I hope

348.38 --> 356.45
you're hearing me I don't know what you

354.02 --> 358.66999999999996
want to do it if you just want to if you

356.45 --> 359.96
just have this amazing material want to

358.67 --> 362.59000000000003
share that's what you've been doing so

359.96 --> 368.57
far and yeah it is it has been awesome

362.59 --> 372.60999999999996
but we all need to consider like what

368.57 --> 375.739
we're touching upon really and

372.61 --> 375.73900000000003
[Music]

377.46 --> 383.48999999999995
before we start repeating the history

381.21 --> 388.84999999999997
that we're uncovering maybe we should

383.49 --> 394.59000000000003
learn from it before we start doing that

388.85 --> 402.06
see what I mean because yeah if things

394.59 --> 403.97999999999996
have been removed it's such a

402.06 --> 406.11
double-edged sword with knowledge with

403.98 --> 409.23
like especially like powerful knowledge

406.11 --> 416.64
is yeah if you remove it you take it

409.23 --> 419.90000000000003
away that's evil but and of course yeah

416.64 --> 423.18
they're the reasons why it will

419.9 --> 425.48999999999995
destabilize the control base of the

423.18 --> 430.62
controllers that's just a very illogical

425.49 --> 434.63
sum game how that works but yeah when it

430.62 --> 437.46
comes to really heavy stuff

434.63 --> 441.18
sometimes things are hidden not just

437.46 --> 443.43
because of power like oh it's dangerous

441.18 --> 445.2
to our power base but because it's just

443.43 --> 448.53000000000003
dangerous in general it might be

445.2 --> 452.96999999999997
dangerous to humanity that kind of thing

448.53 --> 456.71
that also yeah so we gotta be careful we

452.97 --> 465.81
gotta be ethical and approach always and

456.71 --> 470.03999999999996
not just for socially but also see also

465.81 --> 473.07
technically with with the knowledge that

470.04 --> 476.85
we didn't with that that's obvious okay

473.07 --> 482.15999999999997
that's I put it out there because yeah I

476.85 --> 484.68
have ideas like realizations that I

482.16 --> 487.8
think are probably true that I just

484.68 --> 492.3
think like yeah maybe it's better if I

487.8 --> 496.31
don't share this idea because the wrong

492.3 --> 498.51
people might get the right idea you know

496.31 --> 501.48
especially if it's just gonna be out

498.51 --> 507.05
there for anyone to see anyone might

501.48 --> 507.05
catch on and get the wrong idea and

511.74 --> 522.28
yeah that's that's the power of real

516.55 --> 525.7199999999999
knowledge of real science never any real

522.28 --> 529.51
knowledge on which which you can use to

525.72 --> 533.14
yeah apply science to get to engineer

529.51 --> 536.22
new things a new concept like yeah you

533.14 --> 539.29
always see what is most at the forefront

536.22 --> 541.99
but you also gotta realize like yeah

539.29 --> 546.01
when you deepen this knowledge what are

541.99 --> 551.83
you gonna likely find and you got to

546.01 --> 558.67
think ahead so yeah be careful with what

551.83 --> 563.5
we engage with and it's very exciting

558.67 --> 567.04
let's just say it like that but it's but

563.5 --> 571.11
yeah it could be it also makes me

567.04 --> 572.3199999999999
nervous just let's say it like that like

571.11 --> 576.67
anyway

572.32 --> 580.5300000000001
I'm I'm drawn wandering off in meta talk

576.67 --> 584.05
now so but anyway yeah and did you cook

580.53 --> 592.36
alternative history the technologies

584.05 --> 594.4
they had and what would be the

592.36 --> 600.85
consequences of rediscovering these

594.4 --> 604.66
technologies and I'm not just talking

600.85 --> 607.78
about ok the elite are now gonna apply

604.66 --> 611.0799999999999
this like they say oh you can do this

607.78 --> 612.88
with it see but yeah they're not gonna

611.08 --> 613.6600000000001
tell you what else they discovered you

612.88 --> 615.88
can do with it

613.66 --> 617.1999999999999
especially the things that are extremely

615.88 --> 619.78
dangerous and they want to keep to

617.2 --> 624.0400000000001
themselves use some kind of secret

619.78 --> 626.17
backup panic plan or whatever that's how

624.04 --> 629.77
we know they always do it but yeah it

626.17 --> 631.9799999999999
we're gonna be just individuals out here

629.77 --> 635.8
in the world discovering it on our own

631.98 --> 638.65
that's not really a control set up like

635.8 --> 640.0
that because every individual is

638.65 --> 642.6999999999999
basically gonna do with that knowledge

640.0 --> 648.76
is as they see fit whether they be

642.7 --> 656.8900000000001
responsible in nature or not so yeah

648.76 --> 665.46
again we gotta be careful hello Jose

656.89 --> 665.46
welcome chat air whooshing yeah

667.86 --> 674.77
but since Martin has already been

672.3 --> 676.75
putting the concept out there I might

674.77 --> 679.77
talk about an idea that I had like

676.75 --> 682.78
beforehand even and that is that yeah

679.77 --> 686.98
maybe the fascist has something to do

682.78 --> 690.5799999999999
with with what we know as nuclear

686.98 --> 693.28
explosion technology because hey if

690.58 --> 695.37
nuclear technology is very dangerous and

693.28 --> 700.51
supposedly is big boom

695.37 --> 703.84
poison super dangerous yeah electrical

700.51 --> 707.53
failures all that type of phenomena then

703.84 --> 711.48
yeah you wouldn't want to you want a

707.53 --> 714.1899999999999
good cover would be fake technical specs

711.48 --> 719.02
so people that might bump into these

714.19 --> 722.71
might try it out and just fail instead

719.02 --> 725.14
of actually telling what's going on what

722.71 --> 729.12
the real effect is and maybe who knows

725.14 --> 732.85
maybe the flesh is mechanism that

729.12 --> 736.87
pattern system is part of the actual

732.85 --> 740.0500000000001
mega explosion thingy device that we are

736.87 --> 742.6
being taught are nuclear bombs that use

740.05 --> 746.67
nuclear fission blah blah blah but yeah

742.6 --> 751.32
maybe the fascist is involved and thus

746.67 --> 757.63
should we proceed figuring out how maybe

751.32 --> 760.1800000000001
not you know no I think it's better that

757.63 --> 764.08
people don't figure out how to actually

760.18 --> 770.77
do that because we don't want especially

764.08 --> 773.74
in this age of total idiocy and neurotic

770.77 --> 778.5699999999999
extremism we don't want people getting

773.74 --> 781.44
these crazy ideas and that sounds

778.57 --> 786.07
superficial I guess but it's just yeah

781.44 --> 789.2700000000001
anyway enough about it hey Adam II can

786.07 --> 789.2700000000001
see it yet

794.839 --> 801.7090000000001
so if anybody wants to join me out here

798.389 --> 801.7090000000001
that would be nice

824.75 --> 835.46
good morning chocolate saying so it's a

831.9 --> 835.4599999999999
friends and chap get to see you all

836.9 --> 850.31
waking up for the debates to come my

845.85 --> 850.3100000000001
show really isn't the same is it cuz

854.37 --> 861.63
I'm just nothing I'm just not Nathan and

857.37 --> 866.94
Riley then they really hold that

861.63 --> 870.6
standard and I get it it's very good

866.94 --> 873.72
technical aspect of it again just like

870.6 --> 876.0600000000001
when you delve into presuppositions you

873.72 --> 878.58
can still point the flaws at the flaws

876.06 --> 880.0799999999999
that's what I like to do because I don't

878.58 --> 882.3000000000001
mind begging the question it's just

880.08 --> 883.1600000000001
science fiction to me anyway and I know

882.3 --> 885.5
it well

883.16 --> 888.3
it's getting better my knowledge

885.5 --> 890.279
although yeah not the math but I just

888.3 --> 893.9399999999999
not interested but I know it's there I

890.279 --> 897.779
know the pattern of it like visually

893.94 --> 901.2600000000001
roughly you know how it all the math may

897.779 --> 903.06
be works because it's never been my best

901.26 --> 909.38
talent but I do get the feel for

903.06 --> 918.2299999999999
structure that's what I am good at so I

909.38 --> 920.85
do figure out what's going on and yeah

918.23 --> 923.04
I'm just very interested in the

920.85 --> 926.12
structure of things and if you're going

923.04 --> 928.77
to be how do you say super hardcore

926.12 --> 932.2090000000001
scientific but everything yeah then

928.77 --> 935.3
there's not it's over it very quickly

932.209 --> 943.4699999999999
there's not a lot to talk about that and

935.3 --> 946.4399999999999
I think it it is interesting how ways of

943.47 --> 948.57
thinking and certain reasoning

946.44 --> 952.6500000000001
constructs have come into being where

948.57 --> 956.8100000000001
they're coming from what of them are

952.65 --> 960.8299999999999
naturally born and what of them are

956.81 --> 963.4799999999999
basically pushed by political necessity

960.83 --> 965.64
it's good to differentiate what is a

963.48 --> 968.76
naturally strong thought and what is

965.64 --> 971.3389999999999
really like okay they know that they're

968.76 --> 975.15
not being ethical anymore but they are

971.339 --> 977.0400000000001
like in fear like in panic mode so

975.15 --> 979.68
they're being political about everything

977.04 --> 982.9499999999999
and they will lie whatever it takes to

979.68 --> 986.01
just get over that panic basically that

982.95 --> 988.1
they can even admit they have so they

986.01 --> 990.5699999999999
have to be political about everything

988.1 --> 992.49
and there's a big difference and of

990.57 --> 996.1800000000001
course people know that especially when

992.49 --> 997.5
you just talking about with them you'll

996.18 --> 1008.0899999999999
figure it out quickly

997.5 --> 1012.97
they're politicized or not but I think

1008.09 --> 1016.58
it is just very interesting how a

1012.97 --> 1019.5500000000001
construct like the construct of the the

1016.58 --> 1024.92
the heliocentric model how such a

1019.55 --> 1029.57
construct sticks on people and what

1024.92 --> 1030.8600000000001
motivates them to hold on to it where

1029.57 --> 1032.48
that's coming from where's that

1030.86 --> 1036.4099999999999
motivation coming from where is it

1032.48 --> 1038.63
routed in what period because ya can

1036.41 --> 1041.6000000000001
most of it will as especially in the

1038.63 --> 1044.709
beginning they haven't really delved

1041.6 --> 1044.7089999999998
into it when they happen

1044.8 --> 1049.539
[Music]

1055.24 --> 1057.3
you

1080.08 --> 1085.1789999999999
right that was flat earther skyping me

1086.38 --> 1094.3700000000001
he's gonna join the show I guess after

1091.28 --> 1106.16
all and I still figuring out how it

1094.37 --> 1107.7199999999998
works so there you go so you know he's

1106.16 --> 1110.75
probably never done it before

1107.72 --> 1112.82
no wait he probably has done I'm figure

1110.75 --> 1121.94
it out soon enough anyway we're gonna

1112.82 --> 1123.77
get a new guest yeah yeah I got the

1121.94 --> 1126.2
Skype call that's why there was no so I

1123.77 --> 1128.44
turned off the mute I I turned it to

1126.2 --> 1128.44
mute

1140.52 --> 1143.96
[Music]

1151.5 --> 1154.34
weird

1176.25 --> 1179.21
I don't get it

1182.49 --> 1187.409
I'm trying to figure out here what's

1184.379 --> 1193.549
going on Jeff they're talking about a -

1187.409 --> 1193.5490000000002
what what - I'll get it

1203.56 --> 1214.75
oh you mean this rag yeah I I want a new

1210.73 --> 1223.3
one definitely I need a new one

1214.75 --> 1223.93
I do wash it but I definitely need a new

1223.3 --> 1235.36
one

1223.93 --> 1239.52
oh there this thing yeah you're all in

1235.36 --> 1246.6699999999998
very truly moods apparently well look I

1239.52 --> 1251.3799999999999
don't really know you know I'm pretty

1246.67 --> 1255.79
neutral about my mustache booty and I've

1251.38 --> 1259.39
had positive responses as well as people

1255.79 --> 1264.04
that thought it was a little bit odd but

1259.39 --> 1266.38
yeah it's it's 50/50 but I've had some

1264.04 --> 1274.24
really positive responses from certain

1266.38 --> 1279.25
ladies uh I don't know I kind of like it

1274.24 --> 1282.49
and yeah as I said before it's nice and

1279.25 --> 1287.62
warm when I'm on my bike it's really

1282.49 --> 1289.6
cold so yeah I'm gonna keep it and as I

1287.62 --> 1293.83
said before maybe like in the springtime

1289.6 --> 1297.07
I might take it off again but I'm just

1293.83 --> 1299.02
gonna see where it goes and if it gets

1297.07 --> 1302.26
any better because yeah

1299.02 --> 1306.15
I'm not freaking blind I know it's not

1302.26 --> 1310.17
like the best mustache in the world

1306.15 --> 1315.01
because as I've been saying all my life

1310.17 --> 1317.5
like I'm a half-elf let's just say it

1315.01 --> 1319.99
like that so facial hair and me don't

1317.5 --> 1323.95
really work out that great and I'm

1319.99 --> 1325.96
pretty surprised I like if you ask me 15

1323.95 --> 1328.99
years ago I thought no I'm never gonna

1325.96 --> 1330.3400000000001
get a mus that's just not possible and

1328.99 --> 1332.6200000000001
yeah there you go

1330.34 --> 1335.08
I have mustache so I'm kind of surprised

1332.62 --> 1336.6799999999998
that I can even grow something that can

1335.08 --> 1339.6899999999998
resemble a mustache

1336.68 --> 1343.92
yeah a beard that's absolutely never

1339.69 --> 1349.22
gonna happen because no just nut can't

1343.92 --> 1352.41
work I sort of tried it no it's stupid

1349.22 --> 1354.3
it's never gonna be a beard this is just

1352.41 --> 1357.39
never going to be covered with beard

1354.3 --> 1369.96
Harris it just doesn't work like no

1357.39 --> 1374.1000000000001
matter what I try I don't know but

1369.96 --> 1381.5900000000001
anyway enough about me and my facial

1374.1 --> 1381.59
features yeah

1388.35 --> 1392.869
yeah

1389.81 --> 1392.869
[Music]

1403.17 --> 1409.3500000000001
yeah I don't know it's just facial hair

1406.92 --> 1411.6000000000001
and everything that's just very

1409.35 --> 1415.32
different for people who have long hair

1411.6 --> 1423.6599999999999
like I do and not a lot of men have long

1415.32 --> 1426.809
hair these days and yeah sometimes they

1423.66 --> 1428.64
do and then yeah a mustache impaired can

1426.809 --> 1431.37
look really charming or you can look

1428.64 --> 1435.96
like Jesus or whatever depending on how

1431.37 --> 1438.51
you treat it and I guess for me

1435.96 --> 1441.1200000000001
yeah with since moustaches as good as

1438.51 --> 1449.61
it's gonna be with me it's going more

1441.12 --> 1454.3799999999999
for almost say bit of a Mediterranean

1449.61 --> 1464.9099999999999
look rather but half I don't know I

1454.38 --> 1472.13
don't know what I am just know that I

1464.91 --> 1475.3200000000002
wear black almost always 99% of the time

1472.13 --> 1480.0900000000001
that's when I go to church and doing a

1475.32 --> 1482.6399999999999
lot of that recently because technically

1480.09 --> 1488.6689999999999
it's not really necessary anyway since

1482.64 --> 1491.66
the body is the temple so a we're sure

1488.669 --> 1491.66
darkness that earther

1505.349 --> 1515.289
hmmm maybe he's having browser troubles

1512.219 --> 1517.299
or he's on the mobile phone and that's

1515.289 --> 1527.259
going to be very difficult either way

1517.299 --> 1530.679
yeah well you guys are in a Charlie mood

1527.259 --> 1533.999
I guess are you talking about these

1530.679 --> 1538.799
subjects kind of strengthens that sense

1533.999 --> 1538.799
broad it's my own fault

1560.77 --> 1567.97

lumberjack there you go yeah yeah I

1616.39 --> 1622.0900000000001

where there is slightly less hair and

1666.76 --> 1674.5
it's just it's just like that I can't

raggedy caveman serious

1742.08 --> 1751.33
so asymmetrical it's really annoying

1746.34 --> 1753.9399999999998

2147.759 --> 2156.969
check the Calico ah right thanks yeah

2154.9 --> 2159.67
okay I hadn't know I'd never heard that

2156.969 --> 2170.199
word before literally it's probably not

2159.67 --> 2173.289
the same in Dutch yeah it's usually very

2170.199 --> 2176.89
raggedy-looking cats nothing hard but

2173.289 --> 2179.289
just like stitched patches of color yeah

2176.89 --> 2180.779
usually white black and ginger yeah

2179.289 --> 2185.5890000000004
exactly

2180.779 --> 2188.709
combination yeah I had a cat in in the

2185.589 --> 2190.599
family yeah my last cat was like third

2188.709 --> 2195.64
generation of that and that cat was like

2190.599 --> 2198.039
a wild drifting cat and it was already a

2195.64 --> 2201.8489999999997
crossover between one of those types of

2198.039 --> 2204.7490000000003
cats and typical siper

2201.849 --> 2208.7490000000003
which is the most common cat around and

2204.749 --> 2212.319
also had a bit of Siam ease in it so it

2208.749 --> 2215.769
was like a total mix but had all of

2212.319 --> 2219.3089999999997
those typical look elements to it so

2215.769 --> 2223.089
even the patch thing would be like a sub

2219.309 --> 2224.8590000000004
texture in the entire standard setting

2223.089 --> 2229.0589999999997
it was amazing

2224.859 --> 2230.619
look at that can they find a picture so

2229.059 --> 2235.779
it had all of it combined very

2230.619 --> 2241.599
interesting very smart cat very

2235.779 --> 2243.279
charismatic I was able to care to take a

2241.599 --> 2246.069
few pictures of the moon today when I

2243.279 --> 2248.47
got here with the p900 hey I could just

2246.069 --> 2251.23
see their little bit smile very themed

2248.47 --> 2252.549
sleeper around in one side I don't know

2251.23 --> 2254.68
if tomorrow is gonna be a battle

2252.549 --> 2256.66
that's about to be New Moon right sure

2254.68 --> 2260.769
yeah very soon I don't know if tomorrow

2256.66 --> 2263.8289999999997
or the day after I could hit the earth

2260.769 --> 2266.2299999999996
sign and it was before the sunrise the

2263.829 --> 2268.9
moon close in the horizon but I could

2266.23 --> 2269.92
just see the sliver around grab my

2268.9 --> 2275.739
opinion hundred it took a few pictures

2269.92 --> 2278.349
of it quit nice yeah hey if you got

2275.739 --> 2282.779
something to present you can do some

2278.349 --> 2286.299
preview here and get people like a a

2282.779 --> 2292.059
pre-course before the main lunch at

2286.299 --> 2294.249
Nathan's sneak peek are you gonna keep

2292.059 --> 2296.2000000000003
it to yourself yeah yeah no no yeah let

2294.249 --> 2297.8799999999997
me I'm putting there is the car of the

2296.2 --> 2299.95
camera so I can plug it in my phone and

2297.88 --> 2305.039
I can I'll share it in Skype who wanted

2299.95 --> 2310.259
to pick this and you can share it Thanks

2305.039 --> 2310.259
what what what are you doing these days

2310.95 --> 2327.549
getting my visa for China it's a tough

2326.14 --> 2329.529
decision you know they're just so

2327.549 --> 2332.65
extreme opposites where I live now and

2329.529 --> 2334.599
then back in Shanghai that whole thing

2332.65 --> 2336.4
okay to make a list of you know the

2334.599 --> 2339.15
positive they're completely different

2336.4 --> 2342.779
yeah it's gonna be a radical shift

2339.15 --> 2345.4300000000003
either way all right and there's there's

2342.779 --> 2347.94
equally terrible and good things for

2345.43 --> 2351.0389999999998
choices you know it's like big city or

2347.94 --> 2354.46
rural well kind of you know suburban

2351.039 --> 2357.07
area you know u.s. or China it's just

2354.46 --> 2359.32
it's kind of a contrast

2357.07 --> 2364.15
I don't know whoever's been to Asia I

2359.32 --> 2366.28
mean Asia is just culturally pretty much

2364.15 --> 2368.77
the exact opposite of the way I mean it

2366.28 --> 2370.09
is it's seiken if you're American you go

2368.77 --> 2372.13
live in Europe like yeah there's

2370.09 --> 2377.29
cultural differences but not really that

2372.13 --> 2381.52
much you know South America Europe the

2377.29 --> 2384.61
Americas it's mmm it is what it is well

2381.52 --> 2386.59
every every regional cultural region has

2384.61 --> 2391.0
their own typical folk habits their

2386.59 --> 2394.03
social type of habits and I think that

2391.0 --> 2396.91
like countries like South America and

2394.03 --> 2402.4
America and Africa have taken on many

2396.91 --> 2405.2799999999997
Western customs but Asia also have some

2402.4 --> 2407.62
but they're all their customs are so

2405.28 --> 2410.92
radically come from different roots from

2407.62 --> 2413.22
old roots so it's just completely

2410.92 --> 2415.66
different and opposite in many ways

2413.22 --> 2420.37
opposite choices in how to socially

2415.66 --> 2422.83
conduct and that is also makes it harder

2420.37 --> 2424.7799999999997
for them to actually switch because it's

2422.83 --> 2427.63
such a big switch and it's going to be

2424.78 --> 2430.6000000000004
an insult to their ancient culture in

2427.63 --> 2432.58
some ways socially so I get it I get why

2430.6 --> 2434.89
they are so different and why they want

2432.58 --> 2437.77
to stay that way because it's the

2434.89 --> 2439.33
biggest the hardest thing is just the

2437.77 --> 2443.5
writing you know like at least you know

2439.33 --> 2446.74
if you're in America it's a different

2443.5 --> 2449.26
way of thinking about language yeah like

2446.74 --> 2451.33
you just can't read any site it's just I

2449.26 --> 2453.55
mean I can I can read a map and I can

2451.33 --> 2455.5299999999997
you know I can't read a newspaper or

2453.55 --> 2457.57
anything like that I can i can read

2455.53 --> 2459.9
street signs like park police station

2457.57 --> 2461.0800000000004
all that you know hospital subway

2459.9 --> 2464.02
airport

2461.08 --> 2466.18
all right well eventually that's by the

2464.02 --> 2470.8
way with almost all languages when you

2466.18 --> 2473.02
learn them once you get some of it it's

2470.8 --> 2476.2000000000003
just a matter of time getting used to it

2473.02 --> 2479.79
and you'll get more stamina to actually

2476.2 --> 2482.83
read through heavier more complex stuff

2479.79 --> 2486.13
it's just a matter of training you need

2482.83 --> 2487.83
a chocolate oh that's right chocolate

2486.13 --> 2489.44
chocolate but did you look at the

2487.83 --> 2497.39
submarine thing

2489.44 --> 2501.7400000000002
last night we got on the fake submarine

2497.39 --> 2507.97
CGI submarines last night Jose said

2501.74 --> 2513.74
posted some moon Wow it's kind of great

2507.97 --> 2519.7999999999997
I'll present it anyway let's see how

2513.74 --> 2522.2599999999998
they got this Oh looks like a hazy sky

2519.8 --> 2527.42
it's just crazy yeah it's like a weird

2522.26 --> 2530.3
color gray hey Erick my bad yo I heard

2527.42 --> 2535.27
you I'm not it I I didn't look into that

2530.3 --> 2535.27
yet I passed out after that was it

2537.19 --> 2542.599
yeah it looks weird add that the grey

2539.99 --> 2543.29
sky that was the caller before they

2542.599 --> 2546.26
sunrise

2543.29 --> 2547.94
it wasn't blue yet he wasn't really dark

2546.26 --> 2557.6600000000003
but he wasn't blue he was just that

2547.94 --> 2563.81
color that's cloudy but weird that you

2557.66 --> 2575.27
could still see the moon that and I

2563.81 --> 2576.19
where I go yeah I want to go nice thank

2575.27 --> 2582.56
you for sharing that

2576.19 --> 2585.859
yeah it's again like such a small little

2582.56 --> 2587.69
fragment of the moon there yeah I know I

2585.859 --> 2593.24
don't even know if tomorrow I gonna be

2587.69 --> 2595.79
able to see it I will try to wait really

2593.24 --> 2598.3999999999996
early before the sunrise and try to spot

2595.79 --> 2600.44
it again like I did today I'm just

2598.4 --> 2602.75
wondering like if they're what yeah if

2600.44 --> 2606.26
you go to the heliocentric model again

2602.75 --> 2608.74
sorry for doing that like if you shed

2606.26 --> 2612.079
light on a ball from the presumed

2608.74 --> 2615.43
astronomical distances no would it

2612.079 --> 2625.54
actually look like that

2615.43 --> 2627.5789999999997
just a snippet of light on one side I it

2625.54 --> 2631.329
just doesn't feel like natural lighting

2627.579 --> 2633.579
of an object to me it does not

2631.329 --> 2637.9900000000002
they say the ball is they say like grab

2633.579 --> 2640.63
a ball like a tennis ball and just a

2637.99 --> 2642.339
race it when you're looking at the moon

2640.63 --> 2644.29
and then you're looking at the Sun in

2642.339 --> 2647.319
this in the same in the sky at the same

2644.29 --> 2649.96
time raise the ball and the Sun will

2647.319 --> 2651.52
illuminate the the tennis ball and then

2649.96 --> 2653.2
you can hardly look nature in the tennis

2651.52 --> 2656.65
ball and the moon is gonna be exactly

2653.2 --> 2658.0
the same I don't know I don't know I

2656.65 --> 2662.65
haven't done it but I don't think he's

2658.0 --> 2665.829
gonna work that the thing is just look

2662.65 --> 2668.98
at the sharpness of the sickle well on

2665.829 --> 2673.9900000000002
the inside that is supposedly shadow of

2668.98 --> 2676.63
the surface from the cast light while

2673.99 --> 2679.4799999999996
just slightly before that you can still

2676.63 --> 2681.609
see it so that would technically with a

2679.48 --> 2686.829
round object always mean that the light

2681.609 --> 2690.0099999999998
must be pretty much behind it otherwise

2686.829 --> 2692.2000000000003
there would be more surface of the ball

2690.01 --> 2695.0200000000004
lit up so it just doesn't make any

2692.2 --> 2698.6499999999996
freakin sense it does not guy you should

2695.02 --> 2700.569
be more illumination yeah but this

2698.65 --> 2704.44
suggests that the light is from behind

2700.569 --> 2706.5099999999998
like almost Eclipse so there should be

2704.44 --> 2710.309
more light surrounding it just like

2706.51 --> 2713.559
during a Sun Eclipse basically see

2710.309 --> 2718.21
doesn't it almost look like Sun getting

2713.559 --> 2720.9100000000003
eclipsed but it's the moon so the light

2718.21 --> 2723.28
should be behind it the sunlight

2720.91 --> 2732.069
supposedly this but it's not it's not

2723.28 --> 2737.9500000000003
even that is what it looks like supposed

2732.069 --> 2739.9
to be eclipsed looks like an eclipse it

2737.95 --> 2743.8799999999997
doesn't look like something that's being

2739.9 --> 2746.13
lit from the side at all

2743.88 --> 2749.31
when the shadow is that close to the

2746.13 --> 2752.2200000000003
actual edge the circle of the visual

2749.31 --> 2754.0499999999997
ball then that can only mean that the

2752.22 --> 2756.6899999999996
light must be coming almost directly

2754.05 --> 2760.59
from behind in some way the angle must

2756.69 --> 2763.86
be very near to yeah to straight behind

2760.59 --> 2765.3
it can't be all like 90 degrees away

2763.86 --> 2767.88
from that's just not probably you could

2765.3 --> 2770.04
never see something like this when the

2767.88 --> 2771.6600000000003
light shine on the balls when the light

2770.04 --> 2782.73
shines on the ball from that angle it's

2771.66 --> 2786.7799999999997
just not visually possible so weird yeah

2782.73 --> 2791.4900000000002
thanks anyway for sharing we got 10 more

2786.78 --> 2795.3
minutes for the show so anything's oh

2791.49 --> 2798.45
yeah I thought it was kind of funny yes

2795.3 --> 2800.67
I was I was given permission by Adam

2798.45 --> 2806.8999999999996
Eaton to tell you until I get a wrench

2800.67 --> 2826.89
so why what do you want to do with it

2806.9 --> 2830.4300000000003
just being a pain now I mostly give I've

2826.89 --> 2832.77
decided to branch people who just don't

2830.43 --> 2835.8599999999997
use them for moderating mostly and they

2832.77 --> 2840.75
don't very glad of it but these are the

2835.86 --> 2843.2400000000002
people that will have resources so I

2840.75 --> 2846.9
want them to be able to put out a direct

2843.24 --> 2849.1499999999996
link if it comes up that's why I

2846.9 --> 2850.89
basically give them wrenches that's good

2849.15 --> 2853.32
that's good yeah I'm really not

2850.89 --> 2857.8799999999997
interested in the rest because if I get

2853.32 --> 2859.23
yeah be jumping in the panel so I'm warm

2857.88 --> 2862.2200000000003
I will not be playing at interests

2859.23 --> 2865.47
addition to this app in angular if I get

2862.22 --> 2868.2
exactly it would be the show anyway yeah

2865.47 --> 2870.0899999999997
I don't really see in the chat like that

2868.2 --> 2873.12
if I'm on here because usually I'm at

2870.09 --> 2876.26
work anyway so I'll say hi maybe but

2873.12 --> 2876.2599999999998
that's about it

2877.5 --> 2882.339
all are welcome but they are amigo he's

2880.81 --> 2882.93
a good guy yeah he is good with the

2882.339 --> 2887.44
range

2882.93 --> 2889.54
yeah but he's had a me can I see what is

2887.44 --> 2894.099
one of his crammed qualities is that he

2889.54 --> 2896.14
has such a sense of responsibility like

2894.099 --> 2898.57
I haven't found anyone else out there

2896.14 --> 2900.94
that matches that level they may they

2898.57 --> 2903.849
probably are out there maybe even better

2900.94 --> 2906.7000000000003
but from people that I've met so far on

2903.849 --> 2909.339
the scene he just has this amazing sense

2906.7 --> 2911.68
of responsibility and he may like still

2909.339 --> 2916.2999999999997
has these impulses to be like a little

2911.68 --> 2918.52
kid but he's serious enough to control

2916.3 --> 2921.6400000000003
that Joe yeah Adam Eakins a great guy

2918.52 --> 2925.27
with great shows and a lot of knowledge

2921.64 --> 2929.44
that goes pretty deep and yeah always

2925.27 --> 2937.57
good to have his feedback on on findings

2929.44 --> 2941.619
always making yep every Friday I think

2937.57 --> 2947.4100000000003
on the iron rail media show in the

2941.619 --> 2952.8900000000003
evening Adam be donning see don't insist

2947.41 --> 2955.89
Adam be you will not get arranged right

2952.89 --> 2955.89
no

2956.24 --> 2963.7999999999997
unless chocolate shop chocolate they he

2959.9 --> 2968.9300000000003
Allenby deserves rich I don't good yeah

2963.8 --> 2976.4900000000002
okay don't think he'll go that far in

2968.93 --> 2980.2999999999997
stolen yeah so yeah let me get I mean it

2976.49 --> 2982.1299999999997
I jump in the red panel and the only

2980.3 --> 2984.4700000000003
person that knew who I was because of

2982.13 --> 2986.5
some kind of a shot interaction

2984.47 --> 2989.569
sometimes and comments is showing awful

2986.5 --> 2992.93
so sure hope for actually jump after I

2989.569 --> 2994.52
was in the panel so I talked to red

2992.93 --> 2998.0299999999997
rhetorics and there was a couple more

2994.52 --> 3000.43
guys on there their circle you know and

2998.03 --> 3002.9500000000003
it was a very productive respectful

3000.43 --> 3004.6299999999997
conversation everybody in the shot was

3002.95 --> 3009.49
happy I was happy they were happy that

3004.63 --> 3012.28
it was a discussion you know very very

3009.49 --> 3014.5
normal and no yelling or no screaming he

3012.28 --> 3016.1800000000003
humming what I didn't have anything to

3014.5 --> 3018.609
present pretty much I say I'm jumping

3016.18 --> 3020.68
him because I will not refuse an offer

3018.609 --> 3022.7799999999997
you invited a flat earther I don't got

3020.68 --> 3025.1499999999996
too much to offer but I'm here you know

3022.78 --> 3027.369
let's chat for a bit or whatever they

3025.15 --> 3029.559
ask me ask questions I answer them he

3027.369 --> 3031.69
presented the observation from Tampa Bay

3029.559 --> 3033.7900000000004
to see what I think about it we said

3031.69 --> 3039.04
about it for a little bit he brought the

3033.79 --> 3041.079
ISS and the trigonometry and tell him

3039.04 --> 3043.0299999999997
the ISS is real so he should be in space

3041.079 --> 3045.1600000000003
and satellites we talked about it a

3043.03 --> 3047.8590000000004
little bit and we talked about the

3045.16 --> 3049.8999999999996
upcoming pontchartrain observation which

3047.859 --> 3052.9
he's going to be there in January also

3049.9 --> 3054.9700000000003
read and soundly and I told him yeah

3052.9 --> 3058.089
I'll be there and they were happy for

3054.97 --> 3059.68
that and when I was ready to live then

3058.089 --> 3062.5
another flat earther jump in I don't

3059.68 --> 3065.3799999999997
remember his name but he was a very brag

3062.5 --> 3067.299
he was bragging and yelling uh no no you

3065.38 --> 3069.579
got this wrong and this is the optics

3067.299 --> 3070.869
and he became a teacher I interrupted

3069.579 --> 3072.4300000000003
like yeah give me ten seconds let me

3070.869 --> 3074.23
speak him and get out of here

3072.43 --> 3076.45
thank you for having me I gotta get out

3074.23 --> 3079.0
of here and everybody in shot was happy

3076.45 --> 3080.859
like you gotta follow host an example

3079.0 --> 3082.54
bro you know from really polite and

3080.859 --> 3085.5099999999998
really nice conversation to a chick show

3082.54 --> 3087.25
and she was a yelling and it was crazy

3085.51 --> 3089.65
after that but it was cool for the first

3087.25 --> 3090.37
experience I didn't make any claims I

3089.65 --> 3092.6800000000003
could

3090.37 --> 3095.3199999999997
I learned that I'm not really better I

3092.68 --> 3098.02
say I'll jump in the planets and I talk

3095.32 --> 3099.9100000000003
and shout for a little bit so it was

3098.02 --> 3102.19
cool you know I'll tell everybody to do

3099.91 --> 3105.19
it you know jump in different panels and

3102.19 --> 3106.69
speak up I do it but I don't use this

3105.19 --> 3111.04
course it's just a fact

3106.69 --> 3113.91
and I will not be convinced to do it

3111.04 --> 3117.52
anyway yeah all the means of discourse

3113.91 --> 3119.2
take it sky yeah it was it was a hangout

3117.52 --> 3121.99
live but they think that through this

3119.2 --> 3123.9399999999996
core that's the whole thing yeah I'm not

3121.99 --> 3128.02
gonna do it so if if they won't mean hey

3123.94 --> 3132.07
I will be there I will uphold my level

3128.02 --> 3135.45
of of conversation and reasoning and I

3132.07 --> 3138.1000000000004
will take the heat cause I'm used to it

3135.45 --> 3140.2
but yeah not through discourse it's not

3138.1 --> 3142.36
gonna happen so you gotta get me in some

3140.2 --> 3144.8199999999997
other way I'll do it I think it's pretty

3142.36 --> 3147.78
amusing I've been like after you left I

3144.82 --> 3150.55
I took a look was still life and I just

3147.78 --> 3153.55
went into chat and did my thing there

3150.55 --> 3156.34
and people were like all questioning me

3153.55 --> 3159.28
to death yeah and check the funny thing

3156.34 --> 3161.32
is it's much easier to just really

3159.28 --> 3163.6800000000003
answer them with really good answers

3161.32 --> 3166.48
every circle a time so they'll just be

3163.68 --> 3170.02
overwhelmed with answer information and

3166.48 --> 3171.82
they yeah they can worm around it but

3170.02 --> 3174.31
that information still gonna be there

3171.82 --> 3176.56
for people to it and they have to really

3174.31 --> 3178.12
get there in their shopping with you

3176.56 --> 3180.85
interacting with you questions and

3178.12 --> 3182.5
answers they have to read you answer if

3180.85 --> 3184.15
they were in the talk in a speaking

3182.5 --> 3185.71
conversation they might just block their

3184.15 --> 3188.14
ears so they may be talking over each

3185.71 --> 3190.06
other they will not listen to you now

3188.14 --> 3192.1
reading they have to swallow it so

3190.06 --> 3195.25
whatever society they pay the toolkit

3192.1 --> 3196.93
yeah ask it exactly it's how I started

3195.25 --> 3200.23
out before I get my own

3196.93 --> 3204.8799999999997
speaking hangouts it's like that and I

3200.23 --> 3208.96
still do it but yeah not on my own

3204.88 --> 3211.09
hangouts because yeah I can't talk focus

3208.96 --> 3213.37
on what I'm talking about and typing at

3211.09 --> 3216.88
the same time that just does not work at

3213.37 --> 3218.6099999999997
all not even 10% no it's just I have to

3216.88 --> 3223.06
do one or the other

3218.61 --> 3226.1200000000003
because it picks up all my attention

3223.06 --> 3227.92
