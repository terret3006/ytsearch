matter although you should be in the in

166.54 --> 171.16
the autumn season I think

177.77 --> 183.84900000000002
[Music]

180.37 --> 183.84900000000002
hello Brandon

184.49 --> 187.21
so

187.51 --> 198.14
I'm just like a relaxed time I been

192.29 --> 200.98999999999998
working on more D&D and then of course

198.14 --> 205.82
oh yeah watch the part of Martin latias

200.99 --> 207.32000000000002
hangout interesting stuff again but I

205.82 --> 212.66
broke off eventually

207.32 --> 215.06
watch some Infowars as well it's almost

212.66 --> 220.9
like a puzzle sometimes oh yeah oh and

215.06 --> 224.87
Benjamin of course yeah he did a stream

220.9 --> 226.91
last night I think I missed that but I

224.87 --> 230.989
did see Easter piano no way that's two

226.91 --> 233.269
days ago right okay and I've been

230.989 --> 238.76
watching a new Netflix series a new old

233.269 --> 242.78
Netflix series okay

238.76 --> 245.32999999999998
stranger things I've heard a lot about

242.78 --> 248.32
it and like a lot of like whoa it's so

245.33 --> 252.32000000000002
look at this it's exactly like

248.32 --> 254.09
conspiracy theory this and that I heard

252.32 --> 256.19
a lot of comments about it but never

254.09 --> 266.33
actually saw it so I actually went and

256.19 --> 271.39
watched it what episode Netflix is not

266.33 --> 275.0
being very confused or during all this

271.39 --> 276.32
of a series that I'm watching right

275.0 --> 278.99
stranger things

276.32 --> 281.09
oh yeah I'm at episode halfway episode

278.99 --> 288.04
five and then I really wants to go to

281.09 --> 288.03999999999996
bed and I don't know

292.96 --> 300.90999999999997
yeah it's some interesting concepts but

297.789 --> 305.74
it also kind of drags on and it's a lot

300.91 --> 309.55
about kid in teenage life and only a

305.74 --> 311.56
hint of some really freaky [ __ ]

309.55 --> 316.99
and up until her I don't know it's a

311.56 --> 323.44
weird combination almost Stephen King

316.99 --> 326.31
like and yeah there's also some also has

323.44 --> 331.81
some tedious parts in my opinion but I

326.31 --> 334.09
was interesting and the age categories

331.81 --> 338.229
and the behaviors and all that was

334.09 --> 340.98999999999995
displayed pretty pretty naturally in my

338.229 --> 343.3
opinion at least and also of course the

340.99 --> 344.77
funny thing was dungeon dragons started

343.3 --> 349.33
out right with there so I thought okay

344.77 --> 351.50899999999996
this can't get go wrong really like they

349.33 --> 354.60999999999996
can't really screw it up anymore

351.509 --> 358.18
although they all eventually went all

354.61 --> 359.65000000000003
Dungeons and Dragons the language on the

358.18 --> 364.53000000000003
things actually happening in the real

359.65 --> 364.53
world and that that is kind of annoying

365.4 --> 374.169
what well it is what it is

370.68 --> 376.96
Emma Corrigan and the funny thing is the

374.169 --> 380.349
demography in D&D yeah that is actually

376.96 --> 382.29999999999995
based on biblical things a lot of D&D

380.349 --> 387.33
monsters and figures are based on

382.3 --> 391.15000000000003
mythology and pretty serious works so

387.33 --> 393.669
yeah is what it is but I thought the

391.15 --> 396.44899999999996
concept of like the whole angle the

393.669 --> 399.49
mystery to the extra-dimensional parts

396.449 --> 404.05
they hint very little at it it's it's

399.49 --> 408.419
kind of exciting but it takes a take

404.05 --> 411.039
some time to get through it so it's okay

408.419 --> 412.599
maybe it'll get a lot more exciting at

411.039 --> 415.33
some point I don't know I'm only at the

412.599 --> 417.75
fifth episode and there are several

415.33 --> 417.75
seasons

421.24 --> 427.43
right so that's what I've been doing

423.74 --> 430.81
yesterday night and the Indies stuff of

427.43 --> 434.509
course planning out things that I can do

430.81 --> 436.49
thinking of magical items they can find

434.509 --> 440.06
in specific type of locations in weird

436.49 --> 442.49
places because in my DD world there is a

440.06 --> 444.499
and the players already know about this

442.49 --> 450.409
they already interacted in the bard

444.499 --> 453.71000000000004
figured it out that there seems to be in

450.409 --> 459.129
my D in the world there are doors spread

453.71 --> 461.35999999999996
like physical stone doors that are yeah

459.129 --> 464.90000000000003
artifacts and they are spread around all

461.36 --> 468.139
over the realm um in the new world where

464.9 --> 470.75
the adventurers are fooling around and

468.139 --> 473.90000000000003
these doors are actually gateways but

470.75 --> 477.919
you have to have special artifacts like

473.9 --> 481.159
giant pearls sort of magical globes yeh

477.919 --> 483.19899999999996
globe so my players got so enthusiastic

481.159 --> 485.509
about the globes and I was kind of the

483.199 --> 490.49
trick and it worked but embarrassingly

485.509 --> 493.219
strong but yeah those are keys and then

490.49 --> 500.839
you can enter what is almost like a

493.219 --> 504.699
puzzle like constructed plane in the

500.839 --> 504.699
astral plane which is the

507.3 --> 513.76
it is like an energy plane that connects

510.49 --> 516.25
everything it's the the energy glue that

513.76 --> 518.89
keeps all the the extra dimensional

516.25 --> 520.66
planes together in D&D and it's an

518.89 --> 523.63
interesting concept haven't found any

520.66 --> 525.37
direct relations maybe you could call it

523.63 --> 528.16
the plane of information the thing is

525.37 --> 530.14
that plane is very malleable if you have

528.16 --> 532.9599999999999
if you're strong enough and know how to

530.14 --> 536.56
do it you can basically create things

532.96 --> 538.45
virtually and then it becomes real in

536.56 --> 540.4599999999999
that plane if you have the abilities

538.45 --> 543.9100000000001
there's creatures dwelling that realm

540.46 --> 551.22
and when I say that realm it is

543.91 --> 555.79
basically one giant gravity less

551.22 --> 560.35
floating realm it's almost like the the

555.79 --> 562.42
white space in the matrix except yeah

560.35 --> 567.22
you don't naturally have something to

562.42 --> 570.28
stand upon unless you less you focus on

567.22 --> 572.98
that it's the astral plane is very weird

570.28 --> 576.37
you don't hang around there usually but

572.98 --> 578.86
anyway this through the gateways there

576.37 --> 583.21
is like puzzle realms with surreal

578.86 --> 585.01
elements to it like tunnels and on the

583.21 --> 587.23
outside of the tunnels and sometimes you

585.01 --> 589.6
can get on the outside there is the open

587.23 --> 592.48
astral realm and you can get lost in

589.6 --> 596.89
there it almost happened one time it's

592.48 --> 598.6
very exciting but yeah they have very

596.89 --> 601.6
little interaction because I took away

598.6 --> 603.7
their key because it was getting very

601.6 --> 605.44
difficult to make all these puzzle

603.7 --> 608.38
realms you have to really twist your

605.44 --> 610.59
mind into designing these things you

608.38 --> 614.8
have to think extra dimensionally it's

610.59 --> 617.95
in the way I design these types of

614.8 --> 620.3499999999999
puzzle realm settings where directions

617.95 --> 621.74
can basically change with switches and

620.35 --> 625.4
[ __ ] and

621.74 --> 627.6800000000001
yeah it's a puzzle realm but there are

625.4 --> 630.3199999999999
very special items that can be found

627.68 --> 635.54
there that would like lost items items

630.32 --> 637.82
that have been destroyed lost and

635.54 --> 642.26
destroyed or just never found again they

637.82 --> 645.35
can suddenly just manifest in specific

642.26 --> 647.66
locations within this puzzle realm they

645.35 --> 649.4
ended up in the astral realm or things

647.66 --> 651.26
that are in bags of holding in those

649.4 --> 653.27
bags of holding our extra dimensional

651.26 --> 656.36
spaces and if the bag is destroyed then

653.27 --> 664.03
they're also lost in the astral realm so

656.36 --> 666.8000000000001
I don't know it yeah it's very very

664.03 --> 671.2099999999999
mentally flexible to work with this

666.8 --> 673.2199999999999
there's a well-defined system how the

671.21 --> 676.37
extra dimensions work and it's

673.22 --> 678.4100000000001
interesting to work with and from my own

676.37 --> 681.92
a dark world experiences which are

678.41 --> 689.4699999999999
definitely separate didn't happen during

681.92 --> 692.75
the indie or anything ever but yeah

689.47 --> 695.9
going from normal world experiences and

692.75 --> 699.14
I think in retrospect mostly during

695.9 --> 700.73
Dreamtime so when I go to sleep it's

699.14 --> 705.65
like playing shift and you literally

700.73 --> 710.0
just wake up standing usually in in the

705.65 --> 714.05
other realm in that form so it really

710.0 --> 719.08
appealed to me many of the how things

714.05 --> 721.52
transfer in D&D feel very natural to me

719.08 --> 724.63
not all of it there's a lot and

721.52 --> 727.85
especially like power exaggeration a lot

724.63 --> 731.26
but just the technicalities seem very

727.85 --> 735.44
natural and I try to work with that and

731.26 --> 738.64
create a better balance set the

735.44 --> 738.6400000000001
parameters a little bit better

739.6 --> 743.71
so anyway didi

749.49 --> 756.46
what an crazy question our rather to

753.54 --> 760.39
entangled crate yeah two entangled

756.46 --> 763.6
questions why would I say and Australia

760.39 --> 766.17
is not real pretty sure there is a big

763.6 --> 766.1700000000001
landmass

771.69 --> 776.82
wait are you conspiracy suggesting that

775.08 --> 780.6600000000001
the British government government blew

776.82 --> 783.1400000000001
up Australia or something that's it's

780.66 --> 783.14
[ __ ]

791.63 --> 794.899
all right

796.52 --> 800.92
I'm pretty sure Australia's still there

808.73 --> 820.4300000000001
all right so let's get back right anyway

817.37 --> 825.11
yeah extra-dimensional I basically

820.43 --> 828.9399999999999
explained some factors about how to

825.11 --> 833.9
think of interacting with extra planer

828.94 --> 839.2900000000001
experiences and I think some people

833.9 --> 842.99
might be able to relate to drug-induced

839.29 --> 846.29
Lucena Tori experiences not when seeing

842.99 --> 848.9300000000001
things overlaying normal sight or warped

846.29 --> 851.75
sight which is a common drug

848.93 --> 856.0999999999999
hallucination described how that works

851.75 --> 859.75
it's recognizable it's just a a sense

856.1 --> 865.28
influencer a direct sense warper and

859.75 --> 868.67
there is the zoning out and going into

865.28 --> 871.0699999999999
another experience like a dream but it's

868.67 --> 875.2299999999999
very real or you don't realize it's not

871.07 --> 882.19
real and yeah extra-dimensional

875.23 --> 887.27
experiences can be very much like that

882.19 --> 891.8900000000001
but the thing is you do you can or at

887.27 --> 894.49
least I could have interactions and not

891.89 --> 898.34
for knowledge and things about yeah it's

894.49 --> 901.22
it it was just simply to be more than a

898.34 --> 904.46
dream there was so much more involved

901.22 --> 909.5500000000001
than there were it's like you could talk

904.46 --> 909.5500000000001
to echos of people it's so weird

910.1 --> 914.71
and somehow they would know about it

915.25 --> 923.11
even though physically you'd never talk

918.95 --> 923.11
yeah that's just one of the elements

924.73 --> 927.73
anyway

936.35 --> 942.11
yeah Australia not being real was

938.75 --> 945.77
literally some random person trying to

942.11 --> 948.26
make a funny joke and everybody jumped

945.77 --> 951.64
on it because of the ridiculing level

948.26 --> 956.83
factor on a global scale

951.64 --> 959.87
look the globus and the mainstream globe

956.83 --> 962.3000000000001
trusters it's not even believers with

959.87 --> 963.92
it's just the trusters the believers we

962.3 --> 966.56
get them in the debates those are the

963.92 --> 971.24
real believers they're fanatics what the

966.56 --> 975.8
trusters they're not really looking to

971.24 --> 983.39
know for sure and ridiculing Flat Earth

975.8 --> 986.93
is it's a ritual it's something you it's

983.39 --> 988.91
like shaming they did it even in

986.93 --> 991.0699999999999
medieval times as well describe they put

988.91 --> 993.53
people in shackles and then it was just

991.07 --> 995.63
okay you can throw Rotten Tomatoes at

993.53 --> 997.55
them or whatever if you like for a

995.63 --> 1000.97
certain period of time that was a form

997.55 --> 1003.6099999999999
of punishment and with this it's kind of

1000.97 --> 1005.53
the same thing it's just handed out like

1003.61 --> 1010.66
oh look we got something more so you can

1005.53 --> 1013.3
make fun of flat earthers and of course

1010.66 --> 1017.68
they don't say yeah actually look into

1013.3 --> 1019.9599999999999
what they're saying so it snatch it is a

1017.68 --> 1021.6099999999999
ritual handed to people that don't

1019.96 --> 1026.74
really want to know about it and they

1021.61 --> 1029.29
hand you rocks or clubs or Rotten

1026.74 --> 1031.72
Tomatoes to throw at the flat earthers

1029.29 --> 1034.6
so you can blow off some steam

1031.72 --> 1036.939
or whatever have a little laugh and then

1034.6 --> 1039.48
move on without looking into it that's

1036.939 --> 1039.48
the trick

1040.44 --> 1045.92
and Australia's fake was perfectly in

1043.56 --> 1050.31
line with that yeah

1045.92 --> 1053.25
that system of doing things so the media

1050.31 --> 1056.49
naturally grabbed ahold of it because

1053.25 --> 1058.95
they take whatever they can to make fun

1056.49 --> 1061.58
of Flat Earth because jokes do get old

1058.95 --> 1065.46
eventually so they're desperate for new

1061.58 --> 1067.4399999999998
new things that are Mimi and funny and

1065.46 --> 1072.89
still don't make you look into Flat

1067.44 --> 1076.17
Earth so the more ludicrous hilarious

1072.89 --> 1077.7900000000002
ridiculous the better its they're gonna

1076.17 --> 1081.66
amp that up they're gonna make more and

1077.79 --> 1084.6599999999999
more into the absurd istic they will go

1081.66 --> 1086.8500000000001
into the absurd and kind of like where's

1084.66 --> 1089.67
the edge in the pancake earth in space

1086.85 --> 1091.08
it is already a sort of absurd istic

1089.67 --> 1093.99
they're already aiming for that but they

1091.08 --> 1097.9099999999999
can make that one much worse especially

1093.99 --> 1101.3700000000001
through comedy if there's some really

1097.91 --> 1104.0600000000002
dedicated talented people that are gonna

1101.37 --> 1107.37
jump onto that if they dare to do that

1104.06 --> 1114.77
we'll see if that happens so far not so

1107.37 --> 1114.77
much no people are staying clear

1117.19 --> 1120.42
the powerful ones

1145.03 --> 1149.59
the flights are fake well have you

1147.19 --> 1151.74
confirmed them to be real beer can girth

1149.59 --> 1154.99
have you been on one of those flights

1151.74 --> 1158.409
not ordered a ticket or whatever and

1154.99 --> 1161.77
then got rerouted but literally on that

1158.409 --> 1165.429
flight going that specific path if you

1161.77 --> 1167.1399999999999
ever done it yourself you know before

1165.429 --> 1171.549
you claim that it's ridiculous that

1167.14 --> 1177.8700000000001
people call it fake you know you should

1171.549 --> 1177.87
be curious is is there something to it

1180.42 --> 1186.5700000000002
and look for me I'm for me it really

1183.24 --> 1190.6200000000001
doesn't matter it really really doesn't

1186.57 --> 1193.77
even matter because yeah I considered

1190.62 --> 1196.53
the rectangular looping model and the

1193.77 --> 1202.68
distances should not even need to be

1196.53 --> 1208.02
greater or or they might be all depends

1202.68 --> 1213.8400000000001
on the this special linearity the layout

1208.02 --> 1217.65
of the realm so maybe at the southern

1213.84 --> 1220.4599999999998
part it is much wider than at the

1217.65 --> 1220.46
northern part

1225.0 --> 1230.1
thing is that I don't propose that it

1227.67 --> 1232.23
has any geometrical consequences of a

1230.1 --> 1235.7099999999998
literal shape it's all still going to be

1232.23 --> 1240.09
flat it's just the looping factor you

1235.71 --> 1244.3400000000001
know yes the rectangular looping model

1240.09 --> 1244.34
and rectangular is an oversimplification

1261.38 --> 1270.65
what well beer can girth I'm not gonna

1264.679 --> 1273.3700000000001
bet money that I don't have and I don't

1270.65 --> 1279.38
bet with globe or especially ones that I

1273.37 --> 1281.9899999999998
don't even know who they are because so

1279.38 --> 1284.47
far I have not heard of a single global

1281.99 --> 1291.22
that is actually paid up to a bet ever

1284.47 --> 1291.22
ever in the last five years so new

1308.42 --> 1313.25
what hell are you talking about

1315.68 --> 1323.5800000000002
flights Bend South before going north

1320.48 --> 1335.49
what flights what are you talking about

1323.58 --> 1337.6699999999998
this is getting really annoying all

1335.49 --> 1340.14
right I'm not gonna bet anything and

1337.67 --> 1343.38
you're making all kinds of claims and

1340.14 --> 1345.41
you're spamming my chat at this point so

1343.38 --> 1348.48
please answer

1345.41 --> 1350.6100000000001
what flights banned south I've never

1348.48 --> 1358.35
heard of that never seen any flight

1350.61 --> 1359.4599999999998
chart that bends south I have no idea

1358.35 --> 1362.12
what you're talking about

1359.46 --> 1362.1200000000001
never heard of that

1369.17 --> 1374.66
are you suggesting that there is one

1371.45 --> 1378.05
flight from Sydney to Santiago that

1374.66 --> 1381.27
actually goes through the Antarctic

1378.05 --> 1381.27
[Music]

1387.98 --> 1390.76
all right

1400.62 --> 1409.799
all right well look though flight right

1405.84 --> 1414.539
okay now stop spamming okay stop

1409.799 --> 1416.8799999999999
spamming please I'm not a flight chart

1414.539 --> 1421.98
expert I've heard a lot of things about

1416.88 --> 1424.5
it it seems to be an earlier disk disk

1421.98 --> 1428.63
er argument to get into that and I think

1424.5 --> 1431.46
it's very interesting because with my

1428.63 --> 1434.1000000000001
model conceptualization of what the

1431.46 --> 1437.779
earth realm should be like I need to

1434.1 --> 1443.58
know certain types of data as well

1437.779 --> 1448.86
and but there seems to just be a lot of

1443.58 --> 1452.279
fooling around with with the flight

1448.86 --> 1457.049
industry basically they are doing stuff

1452.279 --> 1460.919
with this there they're hiding stuff

1457.049 --> 1463.799
it's very simple they're trying to react

1460.919 --> 1464.1000000000001
a flat earth they shouldn't have to do

1463.799 --> 1467.73
that

1464.1 --> 1471.4189999999999
why why are they responding where these

1467.73 --> 1474.71
weird new flights popping up for example

1471.419 --> 1478.95
that we're not there it's all very odd

1474.71 --> 1485.73
but I don't care really for me the world

1478.95 --> 1490.159
is rectangular looping and I'm much more

1485.73 --> 1490.159
interested in

1490.409 --> 1500.5890000000002
lateral motion like equate equatorial

1496.839 --> 1503.619
flights do they go in big circles or do

1500.589 --> 1509.139
they go in a straight line or a flight

1503.619 --> 1511.9589999999998
past the coast of Antarctica is it going

1509.139 --> 1516.819
in a circle or is it going in an

1511.959 --> 1519.0990000000002
extremely wide circle a concave circle

1516.819 --> 1522.449
basically or is it in a straight line

1519.099 --> 1527.6789999999999
that is what I'm mostly interested in

1522.449 --> 1530.8890000000001
and the rests discussions disk versus

1527.679 --> 1532.8990000000001
globe idea then basically emphasize what

1530.889 --> 1536.769
the southern hemisphere is very much

1532.899 --> 1538.6589999999999
bigger much more distance and the globe

1536.769 --> 1540.369
were suggesting oh no Antarctica is a

1538.659 --> 1543.6090000000002
pretty small island and you can go there

1540.369 --> 1545.6789999999999
as a coordinate and that's the

1543.609 --> 1549.1889999999999
discussion well I don't really have a

1545.679 --> 1551.739
status taken either I'm just interested

1549.189 --> 1553.929
in the data so I am interested in

1551.739 --> 1556.989
progression and figuring this out that

1553.929 --> 1560.739
is why I ask people have you done this

1556.989 --> 1563.489
what is your data because that is what

1560.739 --> 1563.489
I'm interested in

1584.539 --> 1589.959
right okay Charlie sure

1591.67 --> 1597.6100000000001
I've also known somebody or I didn't

1594.13 --> 1600.8500000000001
still know him Robert shortman my very

1597.61 --> 1603.549
first hangout and maybe my second one so

1600.85 --> 1605.53
at least my first one was with him very

1603.549 --> 1610.77
first hangout I did with this YouTube

1605.53 --> 1615.52
channel and he's been a what is it

1610.77 --> 1623.8899999999999
plumber maintenance engineer in the

1615.52 --> 1628.3899999999999
Antarctic for several months and I don't

1623.89 --> 1630.97
think he mentioned that there was like

1628.39 --> 1634.0300000000002
how it suggests in the polar regions a

1630.97 --> 1636.24
constant Sun present he's never seen

1634.03 --> 1636.24
that

1640.56 --> 1647.1599999999999
besides all those type of things are all

1643.92 --> 1650.6000000000001
based on ooh which of the art which of

1647.16 --> 1653.88
the physicality assumption bias based

1650.6 --> 1655.9199999999998
presuppositions about the Sun are we

1653.88 --> 1658.98
gonna stick to are we gonna stick to a

1655.92 --> 1662.43
disc in it floating what was it 3,000

1658.98 --> 1664.26
miles above the disc and like the moon

1662.43 --> 1669.23
or are we going to presume its mere

1664.26 --> 1672.51
billions are very far away and very big

1669.23 --> 1676.89
it's all physicality assumption by so

1672.51 --> 1679.23
based on the assumption that they are a

1676.89 --> 1685.2
physical object with a specific distance

1679.23 --> 1690.33
to me it's all holographic and just the

1685.2 --> 1693.96
setting relayed relating to the location

1690.33 --> 1696.6
on the grid and however that works and I

1693.96 --> 1699.42
don't know exactly how it work I suspect

1696.6 --> 1700.6499999999999
that maybe beyond the Sun will act

1699.42 --> 1703.97
extremely weird

1700.65 --> 1708.27
I've been speculated that for example

1703.97 --> 1710.34
say you go further north beyond well

1708.27 --> 1712.08
what the discuses think is the center

1710.34 --> 1713.85
and I don't think it is a sin to say you

1712.08 --> 1719.07
go beyond well maybe the Sun eventually

1713.85 --> 1721.02
even like mirrors itself makes like a

1719.07 --> 1723.78
short circle and then immediately pops

1721.02 --> 1725.79
up as soon as it disappears right back

1723.78 --> 1728.61
on the start of the circle that kind of

1725.79 --> 1730.71
weird phenomena you know when it's

1728.61 --> 1735.1799999999998
holographic and it's based on some kind

1730.71 --> 1737.96
of fractal system you don't all kinds of

1735.18 --> 1737.96
things can happen

1739.82 --> 1746.45
and I have seen videos of the Sun acting

1742.94 --> 1749.029
very weird blinking Sun other stuff

1746.45 --> 1754.479
weird shapes but especially like the

1749.029 --> 1761.179
blinking was very fascinating to see so

1754.479 --> 1764.6190000000001
yeah it's a magical earth realm and we

1761.179 --> 1764.6190000000001
don't understand how it works

1767.259 --> 1770.769
theorize about it

1803.54 --> 1806.54
right

1808.79 --> 1828.84
laughs anyway I'm gonna have myself a

1813.05 --> 1830.62
regular call so it's like Cheers

1828.84 --> 1834.3799999999999
[Music]

1830.62 --> 1838.29
SM - yeah it's really nice that the Sun

1834.38 --> 1839.65
has now just move them out of the room

1838.29 --> 1842.8999999999999
[Music]

1839.65 --> 1846.41
that's so much more bearable because

1842.9 --> 1849.1000000000001
it's really hot outside especially where

1846.41 --> 1849.1000000000001
the Sun shines

1850.47 --> 1855.54
[Music]

1858.0 --> 1861.079
[Music]

1870.94 --> 1874.1190000000001
[Music]

1902.2 --> 1907.41
a very funny Arisa 106

1909.179 --> 1913.469
I don't think the Sun is made of

1911.46 --> 1918.859
anything I don't think it's a thing and

1913.469 --> 1918.8590000000002
I think it's an apparition that we see

1922.14 --> 1930.0
at the epicenter of where the daylight

1925.46 --> 1933.26
is coming from in relation to your exact

1930.0 --> 1933.26
position on the earth

1949.94 --> 1955.19
[Music]

1952.19 --> 1955.19
yeah

1959.7 --> 1962.809
[Music]

1997.029 --> 2004.339
okay team sure it's very weird

2011.84 --> 2018.9599999999998
steal now it's not as crispy as I

2017.67 --> 2021.44
thought it would be but it's still

2018.96 --> 2021.44
really nice

2022.63 --> 2025.8190000000002
[Music]

2040.18 --> 2043.309
[Music]

2059.51 --> 2065.96
this is such incredible beach weather

2063.04 --> 2073.669
today oh my god the beaches must be just

2065.96 --> 2076.07
completely packed like like a horde of

2073.669 --> 2078.31
seals peopled all just sitting there on

2076.07 --> 2078.31
the beach

2097.089 --> 2105.98
haha voyage now I'm not a beach person

2100.7 --> 2107.5099999999998
at all unless it's not that warm because

2105.98 --> 2110.119
then it's not so stuffed at the beach

2107.51 --> 2118.0890000000004
and can be just nice to walk on the

2110.119 --> 2118.089
beach and who knows what you can find

2118.8 --> 2121.9590000000003
[Music]

2130.06 --> 2132.81
hmm

2137.39 --> 2140.46
[Music]

2142.64 --> 2150.9
one of the most amazing Beach

2144.93 --> 2154.0789999999997
experiences that I've had and I think

2150.9 --> 2156.39
I'd did it twice maybe even three times

2154.079 --> 2161.6600000000003
I'm not sure a lot of stuff was going on

2156.39 --> 2164.609
distracting me back then but was doing

2161.66 --> 2172.499
horseback riding at the beach now that

2164.609 --> 2176.18
is an experience oh my god during early

2172.499 --> 2176.18
spring time holy [ __ ]

2182.21 --> 2195.079
I think I was 12 when I first did that

2189.13 --> 2198.1400000000003
maybe 14 but I think 12 she says like

2195.079 --> 2202.549
those horses just went totally nuts they

2198.14 --> 2204.6189999999997
went speed galloping just that you

2202.549 --> 2208.46
couldn't stop them they just were gonna

2204.619 --> 2210.77
run maniacally steadily though they

2208.46 --> 2215.41
weren't just going berserk or anything

2210.77 --> 2219.02
but they were just so hungry to run and

2215.41 --> 2223.279
yeah a horse that is very enthusiastic

2219.02 --> 2226.309
is very strong so was quite impressive

2223.279 --> 2227.869
when I did that the first time nothing

2226.309 --> 2233.27
went wrong it was just awesome

2227.869 --> 2234.98
inspiring and scary but I remember doing

2233.27 --> 2238.22
it a second time and I was a lot older I

2234.98 --> 2240.17
think sixteen or seventeen and I could

2238.22 --> 2243.2
well handle the horses and I had much

2240.17 --> 2246.02
much more psionic strength much more

2243.2 --> 2248.9199999999996
confidence to actually temper the will

2246.02 --> 2252.609
of the horse and feel impulses coming

2248.92 --> 2255.559
it's a lot of psionic processes really

2252.609 --> 2262.3289999999997
when you deal with horses and animals in

2255.559 --> 2262.329
general but I got a lot better at it so

2270.4 --> 2273.7200000000003
that's right four in each

2274.38 --> 2278.94
but I wasn't doing it alone it was like

2276.42 --> 2282.84
in a big group and there were a couple

2278.94 --> 2286.08
team leaders and people that would be

2282.84 --> 2291.21
capable of dealing with with that

2286.08 --> 2294.7799999999997
potential accidents so they were well

2291.21 --> 2297.51
prepared and insured and everything it

2294.78 --> 2300.44
was very cool and the second time we

2297.51 --> 2300.44
could definitely handle it

2309.56 --> 2316.5
yeah I'm very lucky to have had the

2314.46 --> 2319.53
opportunity to do horseback riding

2316.5 --> 2323.119
thanks to the yeah the finances of my

2319.53 --> 2325.05
parents they were it's very expensive

2323.119 --> 2327.4500000000003
thinking the Netherlands probably even

2325.05 --> 2332.76
more than other places like the United

2327.45 --> 2335.43
States or I'm not sure I was very lucky

2332.76 --> 2338.0
to have been able to do that it was very

2335.43 --> 2338.0
good for me

2343.21 --> 2351.71
ha bilgey well technically it is

2349.37 --> 2353.21
possible but it would require a lot of

2351.71 --> 2360.59
training because a bow is hot about

2353.21 --> 2362.27
holding steady and it's there are

2360.59 --> 2365.06
several ways you could approach it you

2362.27 --> 2368.06
could just sit in the cell and try to

2365.06 --> 2370.25
find a steady pace for your horse so

2368.06 --> 2375.08
that it doesn't rock too much back and

2370.25 --> 2380.51
forth if you can prove yeah so it has to

2375.08 --> 2383.0299999999997
be either a very smooth gallop anyway

2380.51 --> 2385.1600000000003
that and then you could probably balance

2383.03 --> 2387.02
it out if you get used to the specifics

2385.16 --> 2388.67
so you definitely have to train it

2387.02 --> 2393.44
otherwise you're just gonna lose balance

2388.67 --> 2396.6800000000003
as you try it or you'd have to do it

2393.44 --> 2399.29
standing like a half standing and let

2396.68 --> 2401.0
your knees be the spring and then you

2399.29 --> 2403.49
could potentially do it much quicker but

2401.0 --> 2409.94
very risky because if you lose balance

2403.49 --> 2411.25
once yeah you absolutely fall off your

2409.94 --> 2414.35
horse

2411.25 --> 2416.06
so you'd be have to be very good at

2414.35 --> 2418.85
balancing and they have to train that

2416.06 --> 2423.7999999999997
trick I've trained it some like I tried

2418.85 --> 2427.5499999999997
all kinds of things I did jumping

2423.8 --> 2431.2400000000002
contests and everything I had yeah I've

2427.55 --> 2433.55
had my fair share horseback riding and

2431.24 --> 2436.91
developed real skills and understanding

2433.55 --> 2439.6400000000003
and even though some basic maintenance

2436.91 --> 2442.31
and all that I always thought it was a

2439.64 --> 2447.8599999999997
very important skill to have that was

2442.31 --> 2452.02
going to be kind of rare and also made

2447.86 --> 2452.02
me feel kind of noble ish I guess

2454.01 --> 2460.7900000000004
but really I don't know I think it's

2457.23 --> 2460.79
really cool to be able to do that

2480.4 --> 2488.719
well the thing is Aries 106 look I also

2486.469 --> 2491.119
kind of wanted to become an actor as

2488.719 --> 2494.42
well and if you can do a real

2491.119 --> 2499.789
horseback-riding yeah that's you can put

2494.42 --> 2506.14
that on your resume as an actor you know

2499.789 --> 2506.1400000000003
I could have been the Legolas

2523.39 --> 2533.68
mmm although yeah that one trick I think

2529.97 --> 2535.6099999999997
the actual actor did that not 100% sure

2533.68 --> 2539.93
the amazing

2535.61 --> 2545.6200000000003
slow shot trick where he basically or

2539.93 --> 2551.39
Legolas grabs the main or the saddle of

2545.62 --> 2554.87
the horse of Aragorn as they're like

2551.39 --> 2557.8399999999997
galloping towards him past him of course

2554.87 --> 2560.83
and jumps on that I could not do that

2557.84 --> 2564.82
without some very serious stunt training

2560.83 --> 2567.0499999999997
that was just freakin amazing

2564.82 --> 2570.1600000000003
especially because I know that was real

2567.05 --> 2570.1600000000003
that was not CGI

2580.79 --> 2593.54
and fellowship off the aberration law

2584.9 --> 2597.51
mmm thanks proficient pirate yeah slick

2593.54 --> 2606.41
slick is slipping down the drain if you

2597.51 --> 2606.4100000000003
ask me the man who has no point

2607.73 --> 2614.25
he has statements but you can't ask

2610.62 --> 2616.49
anything about them or even what it

2614.25 --> 2616.49
means

2624.69 --> 2628.9500000000003
link you want to link Chris yeah I

2627.42 --> 2630.14
haven't put out the link I completely

2628.95 --> 2635.37

2630.14 --> 2638.25
mmm I'll put up the link for a short

2635.37 --> 2640.0499999999997
while we have 15 minutes more about and

2638.25 --> 2643.19
I completely forgot to put it in Skype

[Applause]

2658.42 --> 2661.0190000000002

2664.17 --> 2670.16
not to quicken it up I'll just throw it

2666.72 --> 2670.16
out in the chat

2691.45 --> 2701.2999999999997
hello yeah I thought I was especially

2698.09 --> 2705.08
funny yesterday when slick literally

2701.3 --> 2709.9300000000003
accusing Paul of playing with the

2705.08 --> 2714.2599999999998
meaning of words to try and trick him

2709.93 --> 2714.68
and he called Paul a pohole a snake over

2714.26 --> 2717.7700000000004
it

2714.68 --> 2720.0499999999997
and they're not even a minute later he

2717.77 --> 2723.95
was talking and I caught him doing it

2720.05 --> 2727.5800000000004
exactly the same thing making him the

2723.95 --> 2733.79
snake and the guy is just unaccountable

2727.58 --> 2736.73
he is literally a rogue agent that is

2733.79 --> 2740.21
acting very hostile and secretive and

2736.73 --> 2743.42
it's basically just is a troll with an

2740.21 --> 2747.23
agenda and I think he's a very creepy

2743.42 --> 2750.8
person don't like him at all and he's

2747.23 --> 2752.3
very threatening like that's not that's

2750.8 --> 2754.73
not like dominating that's like

2752.3 --> 2758.42
seriously like yeah I will end up

2754.73 --> 2760.7
killing you kind of threatening like

2758.42 --> 2766.73
some gangster threatening that's the

2760.7 --> 2771.0499999999997
feel that I get it from it the guys he's

2766.73 --> 2776.4
more crazy than P Mars can get snake

2771.05 --> 2779.309
james janese it's right

2776.4 --> 2781.549
you hear me oh yeah I can hear you Chris

2779.309 --> 2786.8390000000004
hello hello

2781.549 --> 2791.9
well snake James Johnson's is a a mouse

2786.839 --> 2795.359
in snakes clothing it's calm snake James

2791.9 --> 2799.859
yeah well slick James I don't know if

2795.359 --> 2801.569
you know in American slang swig that

2799.859 --> 2803.969
means you're kind of conniving it means

2801.569 --> 2805.769
you kind of kind of slimy to begin with

2803.969 --> 2808.17
he's man that guy's slick you know like

2805.769 --> 2810.359
it doesn't mean he's a cool guy it kind

2808.17 --> 2813.089
of means like yeah he kind of goes

2810.359 --> 2815.64
around the system he's kind of slippery

2813.089 --> 2818.3089999999997
he's kind of slippery yeah exactly slick

2815.64 --> 2820.3799999999997
James what's up man slick James here you

2818.309 --> 2821.969
know like that's kind of that name so he

2820.38 --> 2826.17
gave himself that name to begin with so

2821.969 --> 2829.529
he's already putting that out there it's

2826.17 --> 2832.589
just an image he wants to he's look the

2829.529 --> 2834.39
guy's extremely manipulative he tries to

2832.589 --> 2838.17
put out an image and things he's saying

2834.39 --> 2840.259
a feel for things but you can ask him

2838.17 --> 2843.259
any questions so he's just literally

2840.259 --> 2845.93
throwing out images and atmospheres

2843.259 --> 2850.2
without actually making a real point

2845.93 --> 2853.3799999999997
right if you dare to inquire after

2850.2 --> 2855.93
something he says or even ask him to

2853.38 --> 2857.279
code it and then it was he I have a hard

2855.93 --> 2858.8689999999997
time keeping track this shows these

2857.279 --> 2860.88
dates but yesterday or two days ago he

2858.869 --> 2862.789
was having a conversation with someone

2860.88 --> 2868.2000000000003
10th man or Paul and he was like

2862.789 --> 2870.8390000000004
screaming and yelling at him and I just

2868.2 --> 2875.839
was full and blew my mind he's a mental

2870.839 --> 2878.549
patient I'm like look I I actually

2875.839 --> 2881.999
appreciate some of the things that he

2878.549 --> 2884.91
says as far as being like kind of super

2881.999 --> 2887.1899999999996
intellectual about it the problem is he

2884.91 --> 2888.479
it's not a he doesn't have it worked out

2887.19 --> 2890.7000000000003
perfect yet you know he doesn't have a

2888.479 --> 2892.41
perfect system so when he says I don't

2890.7 --> 2895.5589999999997
have any believes well that means you

2892.41 --> 2897.089
believe you don't have any believe you

2895.559 --> 2899.309
know when he when he makes a claim and

2897.089 --> 2902.19
then he says I didn't make a claim well

2899.309 --> 2904.8590000000004
no you did like for example was it two

2902.19 --> 2908.009
days ago or so yesterday he and Paul

2904.859 --> 2910.2
were talking about Jesus and and slicked

2908.009 --> 2913.11
said something about or

2910.2 --> 2915.3599999999997
and Jesus having the same story or kind

2913.11 --> 2917.61
of coming to prove that the man existed

2915.36 --> 2919.71
and then we went into yeah we do have

2917.61 --> 2922.05
proof no but that's not a scientific

2919.71 --> 2926.27
method yeah its historical proof

2922.05 --> 2926.27
so Nathan actually had to explain that

2927.71 --> 2932.4900000000002
pretty much had the same story that's

2929.88 --> 2934.77
what he heard and then Paul goes what's

2932.49 --> 2937.7599999999998
your source and then slit goes I didn't

2934.77 --> 2940.65
make a claim what are you talking about

2937.76 --> 2942.21
it's like yeah you did making a

2940.65 --> 2948.54
statement is making a claim whether you

2942.21 --> 2951.38
like it or not if I said if I said Alex

2948.54 --> 2953.94
Jones and Bill Hicks the same person

2951.38 --> 2955.77
right if I made an outrageous claim and

2953.94 --> 2956.7000000000003
even if I just said it and I don't have

2955.77 --> 2958.44
to believe that you said well what's

2956.7 --> 2959.97
your evidence and I said well I don't

2958.44 --> 2962.69
have to tell you my like that's what I

2959.97 --> 2965.91
heard well okay you know made a claim

2962.69 --> 2968.91
look I don't even necessarily believe it

2965.91 --> 2973.08
but I've seen comparisons of dental

2968.91 --> 2975.12
records from pictures compared that the

2973.08 --> 2980.46
dentals up and they had their teeth

2975.12 --> 2984.15
exposed open yeah it is but probably the

2980.46 --> 2988.44
same guy some minor adjustments but but

2984.15 --> 2993.3
it can very well be it I don't care I

2988.44 --> 2995.13
don't care I mean if he was a guy if he

2993.3 --> 2998.04
used to be a goblin you know even though

2995.13 --> 3000.76
if Alex Jones was born a goblin I still

2998.04 --> 3004.94
think he's awesome

3000.76 --> 3007.61
those guys were out like you're gonna

3004.94 --> 3010.85
find a radio a televised radio broadcast

3007.61 --> 3012.53
about Jones in 1998 three or four and

3010.85 --> 3014.5099999999998
you can find you know bill hooks you

3012.53 --> 3016.76
know in 1993 or for whenever he died

3014.51 --> 3019.13
around that in those years but you know

3016.76 --> 3021.0800000000004
they were basically at Alex Jones

3019.13 --> 3023.5
started right about the end of Bill

3021.08 --> 3023.5
Hicks wife

3025.67 --> 3028.9500000000003
but that was funny to me I was just

3027.93 --> 3032.49
using as an example

3028.95 --> 3034.2
addition I said that but my point is

3032.49 --> 3035.5499999999997
when you talk like that when you talk

3034.2 --> 3036.8999999999996
like you don't have bullies when you say

3035.55 --> 3038.34
you don't make claims when you do like

3036.9 --> 3039.75
people are gonna catch you on it and

3038.34 --> 3041.88
they're gonna question you and the

3039.75 --> 3043.77
problem is he's getting mad as you point

3041.88 --> 3045.3900000000003
out that people are questioning him

3043.77 --> 3046.2599999999998
because they don't understand what the

3045.39 --> 3048.5699999999997
hell he's talking about

3046.26 --> 3051.2400000000002
he doesn't care if we don't understand

3048.57 --> 3055.59
what he's talking literally does it it

3051.24 --> 3058.2
does yeah I'm just wrong that's a

3055.59 --> 3060.7400000000002
politically correct way to say I'm

3058.2 --> 3069.3599999999997
trolling you go [ __ ] yourself

3060.74 --> 3071.3999999999996
that's literally what that is in you

3069.36 --> 3072.7200000000003
know it's like it's like it would be

3071.4 --> 3074.369
like if I went to New York City and

3072.72 --> 3075.6899999999996
stood naked in Times Square and then I

3074.369 --> 3077.9100000000003
said why are you looking at me

3075.69 --> 3078.869
you know what am I doing wrong look what

3077.91 --> 3083.3689999999997
are you looking at me for you're the

3078.869 --> 3085.05
ones that have clothes on right it's

3083.369 --> 3087.78
like everyone else is conforming to the

3085.05 --> 3089.3100000000004
way people talk and debate except him

3087.78 --> 3091.8300000000004
yet he's the one that's getting mad

3089.31 --> 3094.71
about it yeah and then he suddenly

3091.83 --> 3096.69
starts to talk about that was so weird a

3094.71 --> 3099.45
prophet and he said some some weird

3096.69 --> 3102.69
mystery thing about a prophet and I was

3099.45 --> 3106.08
he was I was gonna interrogate him about

3102.69 --> 3108.78
it but he's just he just wants to hear

3106.08 --> 3111.5099999999998
himself say more yeah you don't get it

3108.78 --> 3116.03
I'm not going to explain it in a very

3111.51 --> 3118.92
long-winded way the guy is literally

3116.03 --> 3120.75
flailing everyone now what you gonna do

3118.92 --> 3124.83
is if he goes on Nathan's today's and

3120.75 --> 3127.65
say Orr was also was about this and then

3124.83 --> 3130.98
he got it all wrong in the last 15

3127.65 --> 3133.17
minutes yeah and that's the big really

3130.98 --> 3134.85
think he's gonna watch that all that he

3133.17 --> 3138.06
keeps I don't know he keeps making it

3134.85 --> 3139.859
about himself when it's like well we're

3138.06 --> 3141.15
just we're just having a conversation if

3139.859 --> 3142.59
you don't want to be if you want to make

3141.15 --> 3143.9700000000003
statements and claims and not back it up

3142.59 --> 3146.369
and not be a part of the conversation

3143.97 --> 3149.0699999999997
and he needs to not keep going to

3146.369 --> 3151.56
Nathan's he wasn't he doesn't want to

3149.07 --> 3152.8500000000004
define anything I define what our

3151.56 --> 3156.59
concepts like

3152.85 --> 3159.85
theories purely possibilities based on

3156.59 --> 3163.07
on what I know and what I think is

3159.85 --> 3165.56
empirically provable all that I make I

3163.07 --> 3170.05
distinguish between scientific fact and

3165.56 --> 3173.72
empirical deductions and theory and

3170.05 --> 3176.03
that's just defining it and he he

3173.72 --> 3181.2099999999996
doesn't even want to do that he's just

3176.03 --> 3184.63
no it's just my experience I don't care

3181.21 --> 3187.7
I'm gonna do whatever the [ __ ] I want

3184.63 --> 3191.8
when I want it I will do what I want

3187.7 --> 3195.1299999999997
he's literally a troll that knows how to

3191.8 --> 3198.11
fool everyone with his the way he talks

3195.13 --> 3201.92
he's trying to he's trying to hypnotize

3198.11 --> 3204.9500000000003
people with the way he talks yeah like I

3201.92 --> 3206.69
said I used to go and read in like the

3204.95 --> 3209.6299999999997
YouTube comments affection an eighth of

3206.69 --> 3211.73
fodder debate videos and he would be in

3209.63 --> 3213.9500000000003
there like dissing the show and dissing

3211.73 --> 3215.3
Nathan and he need to do this different

3213.95 --> 3216.98
and that different and this guest suck

3215.3 --> 3218.42
and then I guess so whatever he's I

3216.98 --> 3220.4900000000002
don't remember the exact but it wasn't

3218.42 --> 3222.89
positive no it wasn't like hey good show

3220.49 --> 3224.6
or hey keep it up he was he was dogging

3222.89 --> 3229.0699999999997
the show and now I'm like well now

3224.6 --> 3230.6
you're on the show mm-hmm do you a

3229.07 --> 3232.5800000000004
question or makes it makes a statement

3230.6 --> 3233.8399999999997
about you and I just don't get it like

3232.58 --> 3235.0699999999997
if you were dogging the show and you

3233.84 --> 3240.86
don't like talking to people why are you

3235.07 --> 3246.8300000000004
on the show to waste everyone's time and

3240.86 --> 3248.0
break conversations yeah I guess see

3246.83 --> 3249.71
it's all yeah you're right I don't know

3248.0 --> 3251.45
it's kind of obvious it's like people

3249.71 --> 3253.19
like Zinder who come on and talk for 45

3251.45 --> 3254.06
minutes about the same thing you never

3253.19 --> 3256.16
give an inch

3254.06 --> 3258.2
look they're they're obviously on there

3256.16 --> 3260.24
to troll like that there's no doubt this

3258.2 --> 3263.0
is a little far-fetched I usually don't

3260.24 --> 3265.58
go as far as this but I wouldn't be

3263.0 --> 3269.3
surprised one bit the way he deflects

3265.58 --> 3272.99
any inquiry about himself he's so he is

3269.3 --> 3275.78
secret agent level private okay in the

3272.99 --> 3277.9399999999996
open and I wouldn't be surprised if he

3275.78 --> 3280.1000000000004
was actually a guy that actually gets

3277.94 --> 3281.9790000000003
paid by the government just to disrupt

3280.1 --> 3285.499
Flat Earth

3281.979 --> 3289.009
yeah I know that's not very in our win

3285.499 --> 3291.499
Ian of me but I'm not saying he is but I

3289.009 --> 3294.65
say it could be because he doesn't talk

3291.499 --> 3297.3489999999997
about anything we know nothing except

3294.65 --> 3300.079
that he wears this freaking garb on his

3297.349 --> 3301.579
head apparently and he's black right

3300.079 --> 3304.039
well that's it you're making it's a

3301.579 --> 3305.4190000000003
deduction based on I've seen it in an

3304.039 --> 3308.6890000000003
inside of his room though that's pretty

3305.419 --> 3315.499
luxurious furniture so this guy's not a

3308.689 --> 3320.1789999999996
poor guy apparently so so he might be a

3315.499 --> 3325.819
government project maybe is maybe he's

3320.179 --> 3327.5190000000002
not certainly fits the fits the actions

3325.819 --> 3330.549
fits the profile

3327.519 --> 3332.779
yeah all right hey I just got home from

3330.549 --> 3334.069
dropping my kids off I'm gonna head in

3332.779 --> 3336.589
and try and maybe try and get on the

3334.069 --> 3344.179
debate here in a minute all right

3336.589 --> 3346.3289999999997
all right thanks for popping by all

3344.179 --> 3346.329
right

3349.25 --> 3364.17
yeah anyway enough we'll see where it

3357.0 --> 3366.03
goes how crazy he'll get and yeah I'm

3364.17 --> 3370.859
not under estimating him though

3366.03 --> 3374.5800000000004
not look the quality of a skill is poor

3370.859 --> 3377.67
at best and psychological skills are

3374.58 --> 3379.77
average at best like he sucks

3377.67 --> 3382.76
I think he's literally a waste of time

3379.77 --> 3387.29
since the start just can't stand the guy

3382.76 --> 3390.03
but doesn't mean that he can't be very

3387.29 --> 3391.98
involved somehow and he might go he

3390.03 --> 3395.5800000000004
might go to extremes he already does

3391.98 --> 3400.59
that with the way he threatens people so

3395.58 --> 3403.3489999999997
don't ya don't think oh it's all just a

3400.59 --> 3407.42
barking dog we don't know this guy at

3403.349 --> 3410.4
all literally know nothing about him

3407.42 --> 3412.6800000000003
we've seen a shot of him sitting in a

3410.4 --> 3414.81
chair moving that's the only thing I

3412.68 --> 3419.1499999999996
really saw of him and we see that icon

3414.81 --> 3419.15
and he uses that's it

3420.99 --> 3427.7
so anyway I'm gonna round out the show

3423.18 --> 3431.339
