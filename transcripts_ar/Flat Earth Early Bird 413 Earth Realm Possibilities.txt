31.59 --> 33.65
you

37.69 --> 45.019999999999996
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.69 --> 46.76
early-bird number 413 I'm your host

45.02 --> 48.620000000000005
Arwen and before start to show please

58.879 --> 62.989
do support me through the paypal patreon

61.159 --> 65.78
my GoFundMe and the super chats that

62.989 --> 72.11
will be much appreciated and needed

65.78 --> 75.2
so today the weather is just I don't

72.11 --> 77.0
know it's kind of Sims yesterday but

75.2 --> 82.16
it's a bit rainy here and there it's

77.0 --> 85.22
just couple of drops yeah oh yeah

82.16 --> 91.67
weirdly enough I have taken notice know

85.22 --> 96.95
that I don't know where George is it's

91.67 --> 104.54
odd the special crow I haven't seen him

96.95 --> 109.81
in in over two weeks and I do see did

104.54 --> 113.93
well the familiar two crows over there

109.81 --> 118.07000000000001
but I don't know where George is so I

113.93 --> 119.41000000000001
hope he's alright didn't get like a

118.07 --> 121.21
heart attack from

119.41 --> 124.1
[Music]

121.21 --> 126.11
whatever it's odd but yeah I just

124.1 --> 130.28
realized that that I haven't seen him in

126.11 --> 133.22
a pretty long time you might have also

130.28 --> 136.52
just the fireworks might have caused him

133.22 --> 137.51
to scatter to another region and then

136.52 --> 140.03
when it stopped

137.51 --> 141.62
he just settled there and basically

140.03 --> 142.97
claimed a new territory I don't know

141.62 --> 145.06900000000002
maybe that's the case I don't know

142.97 --> 151.55
what's going on I haven't seen him

145.069 --> 155.11999999999998
so yeah let's use in chat Michael

151.55 --> 162.65
O'Rourke was first they lie Ohio 8:00

155.12 --> 165.37
a.m. and a young Terry Davies Peter

162.65 --> 165.37
Harrington

167.59 --> 177.489
good servant over Mukul mark colored

171.94 --> 180.27
flatter spaceman you go plain an anchor

177.489 --> 180.27
good to see you

187.9 --> 191.159
giulio Papen

191.61 --> 194.84
Sandra woods

201.16 --> 208.81
when I'm on rockin Dell West Watson

203.77 --> 210.88000000000002
charts and ferd bendy water I kill the

208.81 --> 211.65
hope unicorns Larry yeah good to see you

210.88 --> 214.48
all

211.65 --> 216.67000000000002
it's a good crowd yeah sorry for being

214.48 --> 220.66
late by the way I was just getting

216.67 --> 224.92
really distracted watching this guy on D

220.66 --> 227.23
life called the ugly Jew and he

224.92 --> 229.80999999999997
apparently had yeah he was streaming

227.23 --> 232.01999999999998
even though he's American so he was for

229.81 --> 234.64000000000001
some reason could to sleep and it's just

232.02 --> 237.37
flicking through silly videos and

234.64 --> 240.13
everything had a bit of a back-and-forth

237.37 --> 243.79
I kind of asked him to come on the show

240.13 --> 246.28
but he well I had told him like yeah

243.79 --> 247.87
contact me on skype ad this is my

246.28 --> 249.85
address but I haven't heard anything

247.87 --> 252.52
from him so he's probably in it just not

249.85 --> 254.71
gonna do it he probably needs to just go

252.52 --> 260.08
to bed anyway yeah that's the ugly -

254.71 --> 262.41
pretty friendly guy over at D life still

260.08 --> 262.40999999999997
going

264.51 --> 270.62
[Music]

274.05 --> 281.71000000000004
so yeah interesting things happened

278.65 --> 286.53999999999996
yesterday been following the news and

281.71 --> 289.78
you had the Iran situation and it's

286.54 --> 291.22
interesting because I don't know because

289.78 --> 296.91999999999996
of the messages that were put out

291.22 --> 299.26000000000005
especially from Trump apparently all the

296.92 --> 301.24
parties like had to do something it

299.26 --> 304.99
that's what it seems to me they all had

301.24 --> 308.14
to do so it seems very similar to the to

304.99 --> 311.23
the time what Trump sent all these

308.14 --> 315.31
missiles into that Syrian air base in

311.23 --> 318.61
response to that media hoax of of

315.31 --> 321.85
Syrians supposedly being chemical

318.61 --> 324.43
attacked by Assad which turned out to

321.85 --> 326.86
become just complete nonsense but he was

324.43 --> 328.87
shocked by I believe it or something or

326.86 --> 331.84000000000003
it had to be responded to and he did

328.87 --> 334.39
that nobody really got killed and it

331.84 --> 336.31
seems like well I think that this

334.39 --> 340.75
Suleiman definitely did get killed I

336.31 --> 344.32
don't know exactly how well they say how

340.75 --> 347.41
but sure sure whatever but seems like

344.32 --> 350.62
Iran in general and the rest of the

347.41 --> 353.29
world don't want to get want this

350.62 --> 355.72
situation to get out of hand so it seems

353.29 --> 357.37
like Iran kind of did that a similar

355.72 --> 359.41
type of thing that just did a mock

357.37 --> 363.87
attack release and a bunch of missiles

359.41 --> 367.69
not really hurt anyone for real and

363.87 --> 372.07
Amerika Amerika trump as a

367.69 --> 375.19
representative took it and

372.07 --> 378.43
and emphasize the escalation and peace

375.19 --> 381.0
it seemed kind of like yeah bit to face

378.43 --> 383.47
to put that on top of that but at least

381.0 --> 386.02
things have come down and apparently

383.47 --> 396.07000000000005
even the markets have restored and all

386.02 --> 399.90999999999997
that so yeah my original worries seem to

396.07 --> 403.18
have been halted at least for now I

399.91 --> 407.59000000000003
don't think it's over still stuff going

403.18 --> 411.43
on they're still having this apparent

407.59 --> 420.07
opposition at least so the game

411.43 --> 422.43
continues you could say right over McCoy

420.07 --> 422.43
agree

435.849 --> 442.579
yeah level an a koala

439.43 --> 442.579
[Music]

449.11 --> 455.71000000000004
yeah flatter spaceman you know why you

452.289 --> 460.419
know what why not a rectangular earth

455.71 --> 464.159
map as my logo sort of it used to be the

460.419 --> 469.44
original background for the show as well

464.159 --> 475.27
what model do I think your flat earth is

469.44 --> 476.759
well yeah I am kind of setting my hopes

475.27 --> 478.659
you could say because it's all

476.759 --> 480.40000000000003
presuppositional there are certain

478.659 --> 482.889
things that need to be figured out in

480.4 --> 486.159
order to establish the earth realm

482.889 --> 489.759
layout namely the geometrical

486.159 --> 492.34
orientation of the equator line is it a

489.759 --> 496.24
straight line geometrically or is it a

492.34 --> 499.38899999999995
circle or is it in a incomplete circle

496.24 --> 503.639
an arc that will reveal a lot about the

499.389 --> 503.639
nature and the layout of the realm and

505.379 --> 510.94
from just preliminary signs and

508.349 --> 514.02
evidences forwarded and all that and

510.94 --> 517.029
also the lack thereof lack of actual

514.02 --> 520.959
direct proof of the equator being a

517.029 --> 523.75
circle that gives me some hope you could

520.959 --> 526.5999999999999
say that there is there may be something

523.75 --> 528.459
to the potential looping aspect of the

526.6 --> 531.13
realm which would be extremely

528.459 --> 533.29
interesting make the realm to me at

531.13 --> 537.75
least a much more interesting place than

533.29 --> 540.8199999999999
just this this disk in a cup

537.75 --> 540.82
[Music]

541.94 --> 550.8800000000001
now in retrospect it may simply turn out

546.5 --> 552.98
that my suspicions are wrong or that why

550.88 --> 555.38
things haven't been forwarded is due to

552.98 --> 556.25
some other reason and it may turn out to

555.38 --> 560.36
be a disk

556.25 --> 562.19
I've never excluded that but yet that

560.36 --> 564.26
doesn't mean though that the Sun and the

562.19 --> 569.72
moon are physical objects circling over

564.26 --> 570.79
that the in a literal sense but I don't

569.72 --> 574.82
think that's ever going to be truly

570.79 --> 579.8199999999999
established but yeah the rectangular

574.82 --> 582.8900000000001
looping concept remains open for now and

579.82 --> 584.9000000000001
hey I don't know if we'll ever get to

582.89 --> 587.83
the point where where these things are

584.9 --> 590.09
figured out and then hey all my

587.83 --> 596.6500000000001
conceptualization and all that may have

590.09 --> 599.27
been completely for nothing could be

596.65 --> 602.75
could just simply turn out to be that

599.27 --> 605.12
freakin disk but at this point it's not

602.75 --> 608.03
really proven as far as I'm concerned

605.12 --> 611.9
they're still presuppositions to be

608.03 --> 615.65
marked out of the way in order to truly

611.9 --> 617.3299999999999
establish the geometrical orientation of

615.65 --> 620.48
the landmasses within the realm and

617.33 --> 624.6500000000001
therefore the nature of the confines of

620.48 --> 631.82
the realm I hope that answers the

624.65 --> 634.52
question yeah I definitely exclude the

631.82 --> 636.95
the known earth confined the known earth

634.52 --> 641.27
realms from being the sphere as it is

636.95 --> 643.25
being said it is definitely big jungus

641.27 --> 645.89
because there is no curvature that

643.25 --> 650.87
correlates there's too many machinations

645.89 --> 655.97
to cover-up for this already and it's

650.87 --> 658.49
just not that sphere but a in the very

655.97 --> 661.9100000000001
very very remote possibilities I've even

658.49 --> 666.35
said look whatever the earth realm and

661.91 --> 670.64
what may lie beyond the are known my

666.35 --> 672.95
what may lay beyond what we know could

670.64 --> 674.56
in some way geometrically turn out to be

672.95 --> 679.779
a giant sphere the

674.56 --> 682.029
the presupposed jupiter-sized earth that

679.779 --> 684.61
would be as good as flat just maybe

682.029 --> 686.889
slightly curved but how do you

684.61 --> 688.689
eventually establish it again is it even

686.889 --> 692.0790000000001
technically possible to get away from

688.689 --> 694.779
the surface enough in order to ever get

692.079 --> 698.079
a clear singular picture or photograph

694.779 --> 699.91
of it may simply never lie within the

698.079 --> 703.66
realm of possibilities to physically

699.91 --> 708.55
prove that but hey a geometrical layout

703.66 --> 714.0889999999999
of the realm gives us some clarity at

708.55 --> 716.769
least but I don't think it is like the

714.089 --> 720.72
yeah the jupiter-sized earth which would

716.769 --> 725.05
correlate more with the concept of yeah

720.72 --> 727.839
ponds within the ice skate because that

725.05 --> 732.7589999999999
could be a possibility for how do you

727.839 --> 735.999
put your sized earth would be yeah how

732.759 --> 738.309
it would be it's one option or it may

735.999 --> 742.3000000000001
simply be this one ice ring and then

738.309 --> 745.42
just a huge amount of ocean and land

742.3 --> 746.949
masses within them or just a lot of land

745.42 --> 750.269
masses and a bunch of rivers I don't

746.949 --> 753.689
know what's out there no idea all these

750.269 --> 756.279
potential options I just don't know but

753.689 --> 759.16
yeah it could also be that the

756.279 --> 762.129
orientation turns out to be looping east

759.16 --> 764.379
the west and that well the the main

762.129 --> 769.2090000000001
preponderance of discoveries would be

764.379 --> 772.629
north and south of the anti crater the

769.209 --> 776.5189999999999
apparent antiquated points the exact

772.629 --> 776.519
opposite of the equator

778.07 --> 783.11
and yeah who knows what's out there and

780.05 --> 786.5
I've already showed even pictures

783.11 --> 790.07
through some sketches on what that could

786.5 --> 796.009
be like maybe I could dig some of that

790.07 --> 800.4100000000001
up to show it like I need to like really

796.009 --> 803.3290000000001
apply more pictures I don't do it enough

800.41 --> 805.9399999999999
it's also grown out of a habit to just

803.329 --> 809.4799999999999
make sure that I don't have to think

805.94 --> 811.7900000000001
about or worry about whether I can use

809.48 --> 813.73
certain materials and get like some kind

811.79 --> 817.579
of strike for it

813.73 --> 819.29
that's why I never use music for though

817.579 --> 823.8499999999999
there's a lot of music that I would like

819.29 --> 826.759
to use and that's why I don't easily use

823.85 --> 829.88
videos or pictures especially if they're

826.759 --> 835.5790000000001
made by other people but yeah I did make

829.88 --> 839.99
some myself so let's see if I can share

835.579 --> 845.0
some of that for a moment turn into flat

839.99 --> 850.24
earth models alright let's see yeah okay

845.0 --> 850.24
let's see if I can how do I do that

854.47 --> 861.25
okay yeah I could put it in Skype and

857.079 --> 864.8789999999999
then click it I hope that works no yeah

861.25 --> 868.23
this is a bit of a problem because how

864.879 --> 868.23
do I get that in there

876.79 --> 879.54
browser

886.27 --> 893.35
no no that's sorry this could take a

890.2 --> 899.6500000000001
while I need ya this is one of those

893.35 --> 903.51
that what that I really I need to just

899.65 --> 905.92
update my skills also even using OBS and

903.51 --> 911.14
something yeah I kind of lay welcome

905.92 --> 913.9599999999999
last night concerning that that it's my

911.14 --> 916.66
overall passive attitude and just trying

913.96 --> 921.64
to keep in that mental zone is really

916.66 --> 924.31
getting in the way of me just upgrading

921.64 --> 927.55
things basic things and I should do that

924.31 --> 930.0699999999999
you know I need to figure out the

927.55 --> 934.27
details get better at it just I need to

930.07 --> 937.24
kind of like if I'm not gonna get some

934.27 --> 939.5799999999999
like nine-to-five job or something then

937.24 --> 941.74
at least I should just force myself to

939.58 --> 945.4300000000001
realize like yeah okay this is your job

941.74 --> 947.41
right so then work even though it's not

945.43 --> 950.9499999999999
fun some things maybe not fun you need

947.41 --> 957.18
to work at it I I'm gonna kind of try to

950.95 --> 961.9300000000001
push myself to actually do more work

957.18 --> 966.9599999999999
concerning online stuff anyway still

961.93 --> 971.31
trying to figure out here how I can get

966.96 --> 971.3100000000001
this picture in here

974.119 --> 983.3090000000001
mediasource but that work image just

979.709 --> 987.559
image image an image now that's going to

983.309 --> 987.559
be very specific damn it

994.25 --> 1001.27
okay I guess I could try just using my

999.32 --> 1005.97
browser and then modifying the target

1001.27 --> 1009.37
hopefully that'll work let's see yeah

1005.97 --> 1016.9
switch yeah right ah this is how I

1009.37 --> 1023.17
should do that good finally Oh what yeah

1016.9 --> 1026.599
that's to be visible of course oh I have

1023.17 --> 1029.969
no idea why it's so ridiculously small

1026.599 --> 1029.9689999999998
[Music]

1036.95 --> 1045.3500000000001
all right yeah that's more like it

1048.62 --> 1057.61
nope that's not like it keep messing up

1054.559 --> 1064.01
the keys is so annoying

1057.61 --> 1066.4089999999999
to remember which one does which because

1064.01 --> 1068.08
I don't want to stretch things out of

1066.409 --> 1070.25
proportion

1068.08 --> 1072.52
alright I think this is gonna be it

1070.25 --> 1076.909
right sorry it took so long anyway this

1072.52 --> 1082.1
picture it's not the best most you know

1076.909 --> 1086.45
that's see I should even just just

1082.1 --> 1088.9089999999999
Photoshop this out like as this is a

1086.45 --> 1090.38
sketch I should kind of like paint over

1088.909 --> 1093.23
it I don't know how I'm gonna do it yet

1090.38 --> 1096.44
but I should just to get it more clear

1093.23 --> 1098.779
to get a better quality technically

1096.44 --> 1101.179
there is so much that I could do I just

1098.779 --> 1103.76
need to push myself to actually do it

1101.179 --> 1107.0800000000002
and get out of the mental realm for a

1103.76 --> 1109.64
second and do some fit more physical

1107.08 --> 1112.07
interaction this is a bit of a problem

1109.64 --> 1115.029
for me personally I hope there's not a

1112.07 --> 1122.049
lot of other people that have it

1115.029 --> 1126.14
tenaciously as I do anyway

1122.049 --> 1138.3799999999999
this is the cut this is a side a side

1126.14 --> 1143.1490000000001
view or a east and downward view from at

1138.38 --> 1145.6100000000001
the equator and looking at one as as the

1143.149 --> 1147.77
rectangular looping earth as it is the

1145.61 --> 1151.9699999999998
one unit but technically it is going to

1147.77 --> 1154.82
be looping so the visual if yeah if

1151.97 --> 1156.559
you're gonna go by that the visuals are

1154.82 --> 1158.809
possibly so clear that you could

1156.559 --> 1160.399
actually see this exactly like this so

1158.809 --> 1163.549
it's going to take away a lot of the

1160.399 --> 1165.559
actual visual effects it is a model it

1163.549 --> 1168.23
is technically looking through like a

1165.559 --> 1170.1789999999999
vacuum and no obstruction no problems

1168.23 --> 1171.47
whatsoever and it has to be kind of laid

1170.179 --> 1173.8700000000001
up otherwise you're not going to see

1171.47 --> 1178.059
anything but this is going to just loop

1173.87 --> 1181.1
on the same amount the same land is

1178.059 --> 1182.1789999999999
further into the distance as well that

1181.1 --> 1189.259
same land is

1182.179 --> 1192.8200000000002
they're also and technically we would be

1189.259 --> 1196.97
looking in this this kind of model view

1192.82 --> 1199.1899999999998
from over the actual equator over that

1196.97 --> 1203.84
same land you're looking upon into the

1199.19 --> 1206.98
distance that's kind of how the looping

1203.84 --> 1211.1
realm would work but yeah in the reality

1206.98 --> 1214.549
if we feel in that model all with all

1211.1 --> 1216.769
the actual effects of nature and optics

1214.549 --> 1218.6
yeah of course you could never see it

1216.769 --> 1222.019
like that technically you could never go

1218.6 --> 1225.889
up high enough to see it like this not

1222.019 --> 1228.59
even like this but eh yeah I got to kind

1225.889 --> 1231.2589999999998
of be able to display that's a real

1228.59 --> 1234.139
effect of the looping realm in some way

1231.259 --> 1236.69
so this is how I do it and anyway if you

1234.139 --> 1238.82
look to the left that is what should

1236.69 --> 1241.999
what could be beyond the north and I

1238.82 --> 1247.759
even put in the for land masses with the

1241.999 --> 1251.99
rivers that in the in the what is it the

1247.759 --> 1256.34
old map the old polar sent said sir

1251.99 --> 1258.35
click man I'm losing my words here the

1256.34 --> 1260.149
disk map concerning the North Pole with

1258.35 --> 1264.86
the with the island and the four rivers

1260.149 --> 1266.9289999999999
well in a looping rectangular set up the

1264.86 --> 1269.869
projection would be simply for land

1266.929 --> 1273.769
masses with rivers towards the North

1269.869 --> 1276.08
land inwards and there is then a ocean

1273.769 --> 1277.909
beyond that that is what I think is the

1276.08 --> 1280.61
most likely we could find it don't know

1277.909 --> 1282.6190000000001
if we ever will but that could be there

1280.61 --> 1285.83
and to the south well anything could be

1282.619 --> 1290.1789999999999
there beyond the ice could be an ocean

1285.83 --> 1294.289
and then maybe a giant land there and

1290.179 --> 1297.289
while just this idea of huge land with

1294.289 --> 1298.879
big rivers and that there's more land

1297.289 --> 1300.59
than ocean that could be there I don't

1298.879 --> 1302.029
know what's there I don't know if

1300.59 --> 1304.999
there's anything there but in a

1302.029 --> 1309.35
rectangular looping world if the realm

1304.999 --> 1311.359
really is like that yeah there could be

1309.35 --> 1313.8999999999999
anything there could be land or there

1311.359 --> 1317.62
could be indeed a barrier of some

1313.9 --> 1319.45
at some point or maybe there's land and

1317.62 --> 1321.6
then a barrier beyond that I don't know

1319.45 --> 1325.3
I don't know how long

1321.6 --> 1331.29
north and south the realm would stretch

1325.3 --> 1331.29
if the earth was a looping realm

1335.11 --> 1344.1399999999999
all right let's see if I can show a more

1338.88 --> 1350.2
interesting right yeah let's get to the

1344.14 --> 1353.289
very first picture which flew that this

1350.2 --> 1360.88
is just another visual way to represent

1353.289 --> 1365.169
that I wasn't yet sure I but this is the

1360.88 --> 1368.6200000000001
update from the first very hangout that

1365.169 --> 1371.76
I ever did on YouTube what is it now

1368.62 --> 1371.76
three four years ago

1374.73 --> 1381.57
yeah the rectangular squared potential

1379.29 --> 1384.87
ring earth because hey if it is looping

1381.57 --> 1386.4289999999999
in north to south then maybe it connects

1384.87 --> 1388.26
at some point there isn't a berry to

1386.429 --> 1389.64
separate it could be looping like that

1388.26 --> 1392.549
as well and then yeah if you can

1389.64 --> 1401.99
visualize it inter connecting then you

1392.549 --> 1405.0
can go to the what is it yeah the ring

1401.99 --> 1407.1
and I was even then back there like oh

1405.0 --> 1410.91
that good explain gravity gravity

1407.1 --> 1412.3799999999999
gravity anyway is there and oh yeah and

1410.91 --> 1420.69
at the bottom of the picture of course

1412.38 --> 1423.5400000000002
the flat globe and then way over to the

1420.69 --> 1426.15
right to seven heavens and hells earth

1423.54 --> 1428.9099999999999
would be well if there are just multiple

1426.15 --> 1432.2
layer separating the realms above and

1428.91 --> 1432.2
below don't know yet

1436.31 --> 1442.6399999999999
so yeah that's something that I did

1440.23 --> 1447.85
let's see oh yeah

1442.64 --> 1447.8500000000001
so more visuals this is good stuff

1450.29 --> 1460.42
this is the original drug yeah this

1455.29 --> 1463.25
isn't this is a south to north view of

1460.42 --> 1469.63
that same of the side thing that I

1463.25 --> 1469.63
showed earlier I hope it's clear enough

1471.22 --> 1474.45
what could be

1477.34 --> 1485.86
all right see where was it it's the next

1483.76 --> 1488.71
is the rectangular looping one again

1485.86 --> 1492.2199999999998
okay ha perspective figuring out the

1488.71 --> 1495.22
optical slant good stuff oh yeah this is

1492.22 --> 1497.71
the original from the other one of

1495.22 --> 1504.28
course we got this real representation

1497.71 --> 1506.74
with space city above it floating yeah

1504.28 --> 1508.33
but this looks all very surreal the way

1506.74 --> 1510.43
I represent it it's kind of the same

1508.33 --> 1512.9499999999998
thing it's this is more the irregular

1510.43 --> 1515.05
looping earth with if you look very

1512.95 --> 1519.04
carefully if sort of Europe and Africa

1515.05 --> 1520.84
there and Russia over to the to the

1519.04 --> 1525.07
right and America to the left

1520.84 --> 1526.84
that's the looping earth realm we know

1525.07 --> 1528.52
and they would and then the loop would

1526.84 --> 1531.28
be irregular so it would get tighter

1528.52 --> 1534.16
towards the poles and then expand again

1531.28 --> 1536.8
when you go beyond the ant equator point

1534.16 --> 1539.38
whatever lies beyond there is still an

1536.8 --> 1541.36
unknown but this would all be within the

1539.38 --> 1544.63
globe of the heavens that's what really

1541.36 --> 1546.4599999999998
the the saucer and the and the bowl is

1544.63 --> 1549.72
representing it is the globe of the

1546.46 --> 1553.15
heavens it would always be stationary in

1549.72 --> 1555.91
relation to the observer like there may

1553.15 --> 1559.0300000000002
be rotation changes but yeah that is how

1555.91 --> 1561.72
I originally try to draw that it's also

1559.03 --> 1564.3999999999999
complicated you know how do you draw

1561.72 --> 1566.02
things that only have angular relations

1564.4 --> 1567.67
and there are not in literal positions

1566.02 --> 1571.41
how do you even represent that well that

1567.67 --> 1574.99
was a big challenge for me anyway here

1571.41 --> 1577.41
we got another rectangular looping

1574.99 --> 1579.7
concept but this time with East and West

1577.41 --> 1582.5500000000002
geometrically connected even though it

1579.7 --> 1588.78
is all flat so it's like a tunnel view

1582.55 --> 1588.78
this with a little Sun any moon

1591.1 --> 1594.85
it's interesting right

1595.71 --> 1599.669
so then for the final the eat Drasil

1598.5 --> 1606.08
earth

1599.669 --> 1606.0800000000002
it's another surreal way to represent

1607.52 --> 1615.059
how the realm layouts could be but still

1611.46 --> 1617.3400000000001
trying to interconnect it as literal as

1615.059 --> 1620.1299999999999
possible even though it's all flat every

1617.34 --> 1622.5
surface of this thing is flat anyways if

1620.13 --> 1626.94
throw back at the concept of an egg

1622.5 --> 1630.899
trestle earth kind of like the the tree

1626.94 --> 1635.52
picture so anyway yeah this is just some

1630.899 --> 1639.6
old stuff sliding shows it's good to go

1635.52 --> 1641.58
through that again you know I do have

1639.6 --> 1647.789
these images and should use them more

1641.58 --> 1654.899
often but yeah it technically is old

1647.789 --> 1657.14
stuff it's been on my youtube for years

1654.899 --> 1657.1399999999999
now

1657.25 --> 1663.259
[Music]

1678.14 --> 1681.13
I'm good

1685.52 --> 1694.22
No now you don't have a perfect solution

1689.66 --> 1697.52
big chunga's you don't even have an open

1694.22 --> 1700.67
mind really you're just trying to force

1697.52 --> 1701.69
people to go along and nitpicking or

1700.67 --> 1704.15
whatever you like

1701.69 --> 1708.38
in order to sow doubt about everything

1704.15 --> 1712.01
except for your globe model that's what

1708.38 --> 1714.8500000000001
you're doing what you have been doing

1712.01 --> 1714.85
for a week now

1729.259 --> 1734.49
image the earth well we don't need any

1732.029 --> 1736.23
earth imaging you know we need some

1734.49 --> 1739.379
photographs if you want to establish

1736.23 --> 1741.539
some actual empirical data concerning a

1739.379 --> 1748.83
shape then a photograph would suffice

1741.539 --> 1751.799
not an image I know that conveniently

1748.83 --> 1754.4089999999999
were from the priesthood top-down it's

1751.799 --> 1758.279
being normalized to just use the word

1754.409 --> 1762.6290000000001
imaging guess why they did that

1758.279 --> 1765.889
guess why did the cultural change of

1762.629 --> 1769.23
words guess why that is mm-hmm because

1765.889 --> 1771.6589999999999
photographs it's more difficult they

1769.23 --> 1773.309
can't just put a photograph anywhere so

1771.659 --> 1776.519
they just don't want people to know the

1773.309 --> 1782.19
difference they just want people to use

1776.519 --> 1785.69
the word image and overlook what they're

1782.19 --> 1785.69
actually supposed to be looking at

1786.139 --> 1791.57
yeah Oh photographs are images but not

1789.09 --> 1797.58
all images are photographs tiny wubble

1791.57 --> 1800.1789999999999
that's the problem because an image can

1797.58 --> 1800.1789999999999
be anything

1801.78 --> 1804.859
[Music]

1804.92 --> 1809.65
I just did that Andrea Adil

1821.64 --> 1831.0
it's reality it's being literal it is

1825.33 --> 1833.49
like it's in the same category as now

1831.0 --> 1840.059
pointing at people that try to claim

1833.49 --> 1844.35
that a fallacy should be able to be

1840.059 --> 1847.62
applied because the outcome of the

1844.35 --> 1851.07
fallacy could be found in reality and

1847.62 --> 1853.9799999999998
that that somehow justifies the fallacy

1851.07 --> 1857.87
it's in that same category no it matters

1853.98 --> 1860.88
it matters whether you say image or

1857.87 --> 1863.1299999999999
photograph it truly does matter it's

1860.88 --> 1867.89
technical its literal it has its roots

1863.13 --> 1871.169
you can't really mistake it so much so

1867.89 --> 1873.2990000000002
yeah the only alternative to get that

1871.169 --> 1877.95
out of the way is to get that word out

1873.299 --> 1881.52
the way to rub it out in popular culture

1877.95 --> 1883.89
and I do a lot of inserting of popular

1881.52 --> 1886.26
culture it's really their primary

1883.89 --> 1889.6200000000001
function to change how people talk and

1886.26 --> 1892.74
think and they do it more in subtle

1889.62 --> 1900.54
things than even in their story output

1892.74 --> 1902.549
the actual content of their story well

1900.54 --> 1906.09
big chunga's hey why don't you try it

1902.549 --> 1908.549
I'm sure it's been tried but yeah I

1906.09 --> 1912.3899999999999
think that is it's widely understood

1908.549 --> 1917.6689999999999
that the greatest problem is they can't

1912.39 --> 1920.5400000000002
get enough distance they can't do it all

1917.669 --> 1924.96
the real source material for actual

1920.54 --> 1927.0
supposed pictures of the globe they had

1924.96 --> 1929.03
to be photoshopped because the source

1927.0 --> 1931.919
material could not get enough distance

1929.03 --> 1935.54
the original picture takings the

1931.919 --> 1938.73
photograph takings the the actual visual

1935.54 --> 1944.1
input source could not take enough

1938.73 --> 1949.23
distance and that's why it had to be

1944.1 --> 1951.809
Photoshop so why aren't they then using

1949.23 --> 1953.49
something that could actually just take

1951.809 --> 1955.62
that picture why did it have to get in

1953.49 --> 1959.029
Photoshop or because it has to be

1955.62 --> 1962.9399999999998
make it like that well what do you think

1959.029 --> 1964.74
could it be because they couldn't get it

1962.94 --> 1966.99
wouldn't it be a lot easier to just

1964.74 --> 1970.279
really get that distance and just take

1966.99 --> 1973.11
that picture then constantly having to

1970.279 --> 1976.59
have teams of people out there having

1973.11 --> 1979.86
jobs just to edit it to make it look

1976.59 --> 1984.539
like that why wouldn't they just just

1979.86 --> 1987.059
use a couple of million whatever just do

1984.539 --> 1990.539
that one single launch specifically to

1987.059 --> 1992.19
photograph the earth to get it real well

1990.539 --> 1993.179
they're probably not doing that even

1992.19 --> 1995.419
though they could even though they're

1993.179 --> 1997.919
sending out satellites constantly

1995.419 --> 2000.8300000000002
supposedly right through rockets as they

1997.919 --> 2002.659
claim well if they can send out all

2000.83 --> 2005.24
these satellites what's the problem with

2002.659 --> 2007.8200000000002
just getting that one freakin picture it

2005.24 --> 2010.48
makes no sense when you really start to

2007.82 --> 2010.48
think about it

2012.54 --> 2015.72
[Music]

2018.39 --> 2021.529
[Music]

2025.61 --> 2032.33
oh really why don't you present it

2027.82 --> 2038.62
presented big chunks or do you mean the

2032.33 --> 2038.62
the one officially claimed photograph

2040.33 --> 2043.6299999999999
from NASA

2052.48 --> 2061.48
why wouldn't I be able to trust my p900

2055.54 --> 2063.549
then tiny Womble based on what because I

2061.48 --> 2065.559
can't send it out into outer space to

2063.549 --> 2067.69
take that singular picture of Earth is

2065.559 --> 2070.1090000000004
that the reason why I can't trust my

2067.69 --> 2070.109
p900

2077.23 --> 2086.23
that that doesn't really matter in a

2081.579 --> 2090.159
sense I'm trusting it's not specifically

2086.23 --> 2095.53
designed to distort things I don't think

2090.159 --> 2097.42
there's machinations in my p900 because

2095.53 --> 2102.7900000000004
yeah I can actually test it you know

2097.42 --> 2106.839
film do it on the spot the issue is that

2102.79 --> 2110.849
however if I would claim to have taken

2106.839 --> 2113.89
some pictures that are just completely

2110.849 --> 2117.6400000000003
seemingly impossible that nobody's ever

2113.89 --> 2119.339
seen and then say yeah I I took that

2117.64 --> 2124.0
with my p900

2119.339 --> 2127.7799999999997
you know and I can't replicate it I can

2124.0 --> 2131.68
even yeah it was so unique oh well yeah

2127.78 --> 2135.6400000000003
then there is doubt but hey as for my

2131.68 --> 2137.9199999999996
own doubt I can use the P 900 I can just

2135.64 --> 2141.67
look at what it represents at what it

2137.92 --> 2144.9
does what it shows interactively so I

2141.67 --> 2148.78
have no reason to doubt my own camera

2144.9 --> 2152.319
makes no sense you could doubt it if you

2148.78 --> 2154.7200000000003
like and try to figure out whether what

2152.319 --> 2157.119
I did or with it or is fake or is not

2154.72 --> 2159.1899999999996
fake but compromise you it's not because

2157.119 --> 2160.3900000000003
I don't spend my time faking things I

2159.19 --> 2163.75
think it's a waste of time

2160.39 --> 2166.75
it's enough of that I round already but

2163.75 --> 2169.53
I don't really see your argument here

2166.75 --> 2169.53
big jungus

2186.77 --> 2192.02
right yet I have been wondering though

2190.22 --> 2195.98
you know about the whole settling

2192.02 --> 2198.23
situation we know they're being used

2195.98 --> 2201.11
there's even recordings of it there's

2198.23 --> 2204.8
even they've come in the news pretty

2201.11 --> 2208.78
sure Google uses them for their projects

2204.8 --> 2215.48
but I'm surprised with how little

2208.78 --> 2218.2900000000004
they've been spotted like if they're

2215.48 --> 2220.91
even literally out there somewhere why

2218.29 --> 2223.369
aren't we picking them up where are

2220.91 --> 2227.21
these balloons exactly what are they too

2223.369 --> 2230.27
high so we could literally never catch

2227.21 --> 2232.07
that with our cameras are they just too

2230.27 --> 2234.35
far away or is their angular size too

2232.07 --> 2240.369
small for us to be able to see it even

2234.35 --> 2243.3199999999997
with p900 or whatever I don't know but

2240.369 --> 2246.8900000000003
yeah we've never seen like actual

2243.32 --> 2250.28
orbiting satellites that's that's I'm

2246.89 --> 2251.96
pretty sure about that convinced about

2250.28 --> 2254.27
that I haven't seen anything to the

2251.96 --> 2259.01
contrary made a whole show about it

2254.27 --> 2261.619
pretty much but hey we know these

2259.01 --> 2265.34
balloons are being used we've seen it

2261.619 --> 2269.09
pretty much demonstrate but where are

2265.34 --> 2271.4900000000002
they hanging are they why don't we see

2269.09 --> 2273.3500000000004
them more often why don't we see just

2271.49 --> 2276.5499999999997
yeah big balloons with kind of like a

2273.35 --> 2279.7999999999997
satellite hanging hanging underneath it

2276.55 --> 2281.9500000000003
I'm surprised about that that we don't

2279.8 --> 2285.02
see that more often or are they just

2281.95 --> 2286.6699999999996
literally out of visual range is that

2285.02 --> 2288.35
just a physical consequence that

2286.67 --> 2290.77
everybody's overlooking because of all

2288.35 --> 2296.06
the imagining of being able to see

2290.77 --> 2298.69
planets and giant stars at astronomical

2296.06 --> 2301.4
distances because we assume that we can

2298.69 --> 2303.77
but maybe things at at some point are

2301.4 --> 2308.0
just simply impossible to see no matter

2303.77 --> 2309.5
what and who knows maybe if you go up

2308.0 --> 2311.48
high enough I've even suggested that

2309.5 --> 2313.609
it's earlier that at some point sunlight

2311.48 --> 2317.18
just doesn't hit you anymore not in the

2313.609 --> 2319.0699999999997
same way I don't know how it works

2317.18 --> 2320.43
concerning it but I'm surprised we

2319.07 --> 2324.4
haven't seen more

2320.43 --> 2330.2999999999997
from the ground balloon satellite

2324.4 --> 2330.3
pictures so I wonder about that

2339.57 --> 2347.5800000000004
it's no stop inserting announces moon

2343.74 --> 2350.0
balloon flat glove Earth Society don't

2347.58 --> 2350.0
like it

2353.62 --> 2356.73
it's not funny

2380.48 --> 2384.52
what that makes no sense

2400.5 --> 2407.21
no it's a peppy

2403.34 --> 2411.17
the things don't orbit around the Earth

2407.21 --> 2414.71
there is no orbits there is no orbit

2411.17 --> 2418.48
simple as that the lights however all

2414.71 --> 2423.2
the heavenly lights they circle around

2418.48 --> 2425.9
the observer at some kind of set

2423.2 --> 2428.96
apparent distance relation to the

2425.9 --> 2431.54
observer and the only thing that changes

2428.96 --> 2434.11
about that is the angular relation in

2431.54 --> 2435.98
relation to the observer when they move

2434.11 --> 2439.82
that's what we see

2435.98 --> 2442.69
there's no orbits going on because

2439.82 --> 2442.69
they're just lights

2449.47 --> 2452.6299999999997
[Music]

2454.91 --> 2461.94
yeah I do understand the concept of your

2458.64 --> 2463.65
presupposed disc nonsense gleam I'm just

2461.94 --> 2468.75
not going with that because you have no

2463.65 --> 2475.83
proof that anything physical orbits you

2468.75 --> 2480.57
have none and you don't have proof of an

2475.83 --> 2483.0299999999997
actual specific location of a Sun object

2480.57 --> 2485.04
or a moon object you just have the

2483.03 --> 2487.1400000000003
angular relations that hey if you

2485.04 --> 2490.8
presuppose this seemed to kind of

2487.14 --> 2493.62
angular ly work out kind of like the

2490.8 --> 2497.03
globe but different on flat but it's

2493.62 --> 2501.2
just a bunch of light play and

2497.03 --> 2501.2000000000003
presuppositions it's always was

2525.26 --> 2528.829
[Music]

2532.7 --> 2538.56
now there is no moving earth and there

2535.83 --> 2541.94
is no moving objects there is no orbit

2538.56 --> 2544.92
doesn't exist you have no proof of it

2541.94 --> 2547.44
balloons may float at a set distance

2544.92 --> 2550.01
they may drift in some kind of wind

2547.44 --> 2555.81
stream that might be there I don't know

2550.01 --> 2558.32
there's no orbits a concept of orbits is

2555.81 --> 2558.32
fictional

2571.18 --> 2573.8089999999997
yeah

2579.82 --> 2586.6600000000003
and it does matter it matters a lot

2582.49 --> 2590.8599999999997
whether you presume presuppose these are

2586.66 --> 2593.3399999999997
objects physical things that emanate all

2590.86 --> 2595.96
this energy or that they are just

2593.34 --> 2599.7400000000002
apparent light manifestations that

2595.96 --> 2602.28
correlate with the observation and with

2599.74 --> 2607.99
the observer that observers see those

2602.28 --> 2613.57
discs as a light based phenomena at the

2607.99 --> 2616.1499999999996
epicenter of the light direction and it

2613.57 --> 2619.0
matters because orbits specifically is

2616.15 --> 2625.42
desi is a designated concept for

2619.0 --> 2628.66
physical objects based on ball based

2625.42 --> 2630.4
gravity and perpetually falling around

2628.66 --> 2632.5299999999997
that remember that one that is what

2630.4 --> 2636.37
orbits is so you can't really apply the

2632.53 --> 2640.6600000000003
word to numb the physical entities to

2636.37 --> 2644.67
unproven two entities where you cannot

2640.66 --> 2644.67
prove the physicality of it so

2647.25 --> 2651.45
now entertain whatever you like

2667.54 --> 2673.39
no tiny one boy I don't know where you

2669.7 --> 2677.14
draw that conclusion from because the

2673.39 --> 2681.46
daylight is still having a certain angle

2677.14 --> 2685.0899999999997
and it is very mysterious because even

2681.46 --> 2687.91
where the visuals end pretty much or you

2685.09 --> 2691.03
can't see further the daylight direction

2687.91 --> 2693.64
seems to kind of ignore it and if

2691.03 --> 2695.5600000000004
there's not enough things in the way

2693.64 --> 2697.6
there will still be coming like from

2695.56 --> 2700.6
that direction which is really

2697.6 --> 2703.15
mysterious just goes to show that the

2700.6 --> 2705.97
incredible mysterious nature of the

2703.15 --> 2709.15
daylight the holographic nature of it

2705.97 --> 2712.27
and it does give you some incredible

2709.15 --> 2713.4100000000003
impossible seemingly impossible views if

2712.27 --> 2717.34
you're going to take everything

2713.41 --> 2721.5099999999998
physically literal some spectacular

2717.34 --> 2723.19
views unique views that are absolutely

2721.51 --> 2725.1400000000003
unique to the observer because if

2723.19 --> 2726.61
another observer is standing at the

2725.14 --> 2728.5
totally different location it is not

2726.61 --> 2731.6800000000003
gonna look the same the light is not

2728.5 --> 2734.17
gonna hit the same things it's not the

2731.68 --> 2737.58
same because everyone's view is

2734.17 --> 2737.58
completely unique

2740.34 --> 2745.6400000000003
[Music]

2742.72 --> 2747.74
you know one person will see crepuscular

2745.64 --> 2749.66
rays coming through a certain group of

2747.74 --> 2753.02
clouds and then another person will be

2749.66 --> 2755.21
standing ten miles away looking at those

2753.02 --> 2757.19
same clouds confirmed the Same Same

2755.21 --> 2759.17
cloud bank and there will be no

2757.19 --> 2762.53
crepuscular rays coming through them

2759.17 --> 2766.58
hitting things because everyone's view

2762.53 --> 2770.15
is absolutely unique and as the daylight

2766.58 --> 2774.3199999999997
and the Sun our holographic in nature

2770.15 --> 2776.35
very personal based to the observer any

2774.32 --> 2779.6000000000004
side effect like a rainbow or

2776.35 --> 2781.61
crepuscular rays which is kind of sort

2779.6 --> 2784.97
of the same thing relating to the Sun

2781.61 --> 2787.58
also holographic they will not be

2784.97 --> 2790.43
visible in the same manner to another

2787.58 --> 2792.35
observer revealing the holographic

2790.43 --> 2794.7999999999997
nature of the globe of the heavens in

2792.35 --> 2794.7999999999997
the daylight

2811.109 --> 2818.369
Anna [ __ ] yeah but have you ever seen

2814.619 --> 2822.329
crepuscular rays tiny bumble I have I

2818.369 --> 2825.829
just like stood in fields where you

2822.329 --> 2829.259
would see those rays literally hit

2825.829 --> 2830.099
ground in front of you you can trace

2829.259 --> 2835.0190000000002
them back

2830.099 --> 2838.289
visually well other people at a distance

2835.019 --> 2841.859
they would not see that because to them

2838.289 --> 2844.9100000000003
the Sun source the alade light source is

2841.859 --> 2850.2
an add an other apparent angular

2844.91 --> 2854.339
location to them so that same set up

2850.2 --> 2857.9399999999996
it's very low apparent location specific

2854.339 --> 2859.499
wherever the apparent Sun is if there's

2857.94 --> 2862.829
clouds in front of them then the

2859.499 --> 2865.6189999999997
crepuscular rays may manifest to that

2862.829 --> 2867.3900000000003
observer but the Sun may be at an

2865.619 --> 2869.279
entirely different spot to another

2867.39 --> 2870.779
observer and then when they look at the

2869.279 --> 2872.88
same cloud bats there's just nothing

2870.779 --> 2876.449
coming through that they don't see that

2872.88 --> 2879.2690000000002
light hitting in front of that person as

2876.449 --> 2881.599
that person sees because it's all

2879.269 --> 2881.5989999999997
agraphia

2890.33 --> 2895.61
[Music]

2892.79 --> 2900.14
hmm yeah you think about that for a

2895.61 --> 2902.4700000000003
while I think I made my point pretty

2900.14 --> 2902.47
clear

2908.43 --> 2916.77
[Music]

2911.25 --> 2920.22
oh really is that what I say is that how

2916.77 --> 2923.07
it works tiny Womble so solar panels

2920.22 --> 2927.5989999999997
can't work if the light is holographic

2923.07 --> 2929.4900000000002
well no because no matter the original

2927.599 --> 2931.8
source of the light and how that really

2929.49 --> 2933.81
works out there's always light spread

2931.8 --> 2935.79
everywhere that's why you can see during

2933.81 --> 2938.04
the day because light is bouncing off

2935.79 --> 2939.599
everything it's splitting up

2938.04 --> 2944.04
indefinitely until everything is

2939.599 --> 2948.54
absorbed by your eye so there's always

2944.04 --> 2950.04
plenty of light to be absorbed no matter

2948.54 --> 2953.2799999999997
really where it's coming from

2950.04 --> 2956.67
specifically by solar panels even if

2953.28 --> 2963.96
it's not being directly hit by the Sun

2956.67 --> 2967.04
and obstructed Li and yeah the results

2963.96 --> 2967.04
always average out

2981.65 --> 2989.14
yeah that's correct that's what I said

2985.779 --> 2992.72
but that's only to the observer look

2989.14 --> 2996.0389999999998
whatever is Tran actually transpiring us

2992.72 --> 2999.769
to physical interaction right the actual

2996.039 --> 3007.2690000000002
proven physical interaction takes place

2999.769 --> 3010.5089999999996
at the location of the observer so that

3007.269 --> 3012.999
is what's really happening but somebody

3010.509 --> 3015.039
else a way different location may look

3012.999 --> 3018.089
upon that and just not see the same

3015.039 --> 3020.559
thing as the observer at that location

3018.089 --> 3023.5589999999997
but what actually will probably

3020.559 --> 3026.4700000000003
transpire is what is at that location

3023.559 --> 3029.529
the visuals that are visible from there

3026.47 --> 3031.5389999999998
will probably have the most effect not

3029.529 --> 3035.89
so much what somebody else sees at a

3031.539 --> 3040.2990000000004
great distance on that location so it's

3035.89 --> 3043.779
yeah the you could almost call it like a

3040.299 --> 3045.849
mirage in effect a holographic Mirage in

3043.779 --> 3047.89
effect that just makes things look

3045.849 --> 3049.48
different when you look upon them at a

3047.89 --> 3051.22
very fast distance even though there's

3049.48 --> 3054.16
no more horizon mirages in or whatever

3051.22 --> 3056.3799999999997
go and you could look at top-down from a

3054.16 --> 3058.1189999999997
mountain or something have it clearly in

3056.38 --> 3066.67
view and you will just see different

3058.119 --> 3069.19
things different type of Sun but in that

3066.67 --> 3071.589
location where you're looking upon what

3069.19 --> 3073.839
they see and how they are like if

3071.589 --> 3076.39
they're actually being hit by the Sun as

3073.839 --> 3078.16
it and feel the heating up yeah even

3076.39 --> 3080.65
though the observer on that mountain far

3078.16 --> 3082.989
away is not seeing that stay light

3080.65 --> 3085.1800000000003
hitting them I pretty sure that the

3082.989 --> 3086.829
person there will still experience

3085.18 --> 3089.14
getting heating up even though the

3086.829 --> 3092.259
observer way far away doesn't see that

3089.14 --> 3094.8089999999997
see are you trying to are you trying to

3092.259 --> 3102.5190000000002
understand are you getting this concept

3094.809 --> 3105.9700000000003
so nonsense Wow maybe you just need a

3102.519 --> 3107.6499999999996
timeout to think about what I said maybe

3105.97 --> 3110.1099999999997
watch it back

3107.65 --> 3112.33
because I'm it's not nonsense you're

3110.11 --> 3117.04
just not getting it I'm basing all of

3112.33 --> 3119.83
this actual data things that people have

3117.04 --> 3122.94
