starting at one o'clock

93.439 --> 101.27999999999999
not two o'clock i just realized that

96.479 --> 104.88
but yeah i didn't do a show yesterday

101.28 --> 108.07900000000001
so i thought i'll just do the a two hour

104.88 --> 111.67999999999999
show instead for today

108.079 --> 115.19999999999999
right the weather is unfortunately not

111.68 --> 118.799
all that it's really moist

115.2 --> 122.399
and cold outside no not

118.799 --> 124.88000000000001
there's not much wind though

122.399 --> 124.88
i don't know

126.88 --> 133.12
right so it's my birthday today

134.48 --> 140.64
my 40th year is over

137.52 --> 140.64000000000001
i survived it

141.28 --> 143.68
whoo-hoo

144.8 --> 151.44
right hello territ306 in chat

148.08 --> 154.87900000000002
hello you're the first

151.44 --> 158.879
good to see you now this might be a

154.879 --> 161.2
quiet first hour because yeah people

158.879 --> 162.879
expect me to go live 2 p.m amsterdam

161.2 --> 170.07999999999998
time instead of 1

162.879 --> 174.64
in the weekend but i'm starting early

170.08 --> 177.20000000000002
yeah i hope i don't regret that

174.64 --> 178.319
i don't know i i will see how long i'm

177.2 --> 181.44
gonna

178.319 --> 182.72
do the show i might start i might stop a

181.44 --> 186.159
little earlier uh

182.72 --> 189.68
yeah a little earlier than

186.159 --> 194.0
three o'clock right

189.68 --> 194.0
but yeah yesterday

194.8 --> 199.59900000000002
no flat earth early bird show i

197.93 --> 202.64000000000001
[Music]

199.599 --> 206.72
i overslept for starters but i also just

202.64 --> 209.599
felt really shitty yesterday

206.72 --> 213.28
and i think i explained some of that on

209.599 --> 216.319
the flat earth debate after show or

213.28 --> 218.64000000000001
pre-show if you will because i did

216.319 --> 220.39999999999998
choose to just not do a show i thought i

218.64 --> 223.67999999999998
was gonna do a show for just one hour

220.4 --> 226.64000000000001
but that didn't really work out

223.68 --> 228.15900000000002
so instead i just jumped on nathan's

226.64 --> 232.39999999999998
panel a little early

228.159 --> 232.39999999999998
like right when he started up

233.36 --> 241.43900000000002
did i finish the game i bought

237.12 --> 243.76
well for what was available pretty much

241.439 --> 246.4
yes terra 306

243.76 --> 247.12
but i did restart it again to basically

246.4 --> 248.799
try now

247.12 --> 251.20000000000002
playing it again now with some

248.799 --> 252.87900000000002
foreknowledge of what it's like how it

251.2 --> 256.079
works

252.879 --> 257.44
so and the second go is definitely going

256.079 --> 261.359
a lot better

257.44 --> 261.359
it's it's a lot smoother now

263.199 --> 269.84000000000003
so i'm kind of like playing it over

266.84 --> 269.84
again

272.8 --> 275.12
right

277.759 --> 282.0
also i missed out on a couple of weird

279.919 --> 284.71999999999997
elements in the fierce in the first run

282.0 --> 284.72
i did so

285.12 --> 289.36
just figuring out

287.58 --> 293.28
[Music]

289.36 --> 296.16
how yeah how to do things and concerning

293.28 --> 297.84
cut scene changes it's like okay you do

296.16 --> 300.56
a certain type of thing

297.84 --> 302.79999999999995
then the landscape rearranges but with

300.56 --> 304.8
that also kind of like it's the next

302.8 --> 307.919
chapter of the story so certain types of

304.8 --> 310.08
characters that may be in locations

307.919 --> 312.0
if you miss out on them they may just

310.08 --> 314.24
disappear this is typical this

312.0 --> 315.6
is this is a logical problem that was

314.24 --> 318.72
even there

315.6 --> 320.47900000000004
it's a storyboard thing

318.72 --> 322.84000000000003
that was also there in the in the

320.479 --> 325.12
earlier baldur's gate

322.84 --> 328.0
games and it's still here but

325.12 --> 329.84000000000003
yeah it it worked out fine i think it's

328.0 --> 338.08
actually kind of a decent game

329.84 --> 341.52
it's a little small though

338.08 --> 344.0
compared to baldur's gate one and two

341.52 --> 346.32
so far so that should definitely they

344.0 --> 348.88
must expand

346.32 --> 350.96
they they also say they will it's like

348.88 --> 352.88
okay go to the next area uh yeah you

350.96 --> 356.0
can't go there

352.88 --> 356.479
because they haven't finished it yet i

356.0 --> 359.6
think

356.479 --> 359.59999999999997
i don't know exactly

361.44 --> 367.84
polish gate 3 would i recommend it

373.759 --> 378.88
i guess i would i'm not totally blown

377.52 --> 381.919
away by it

378.88 --> 382.479
there is some real there is like issues

381.919 --> 385.52
with it

382.479 --> 388.0
also designers issues like

385.52 --> 389.75899999999996
just trouble with working out the cgi

388.0 --> 393.44
and all that

389.759 --> 396.24
because they are obviously trying newer

393.44 --> 397.68
newer engines and all that

396.24 --> 399.68
[Music]

397.68 --> 402.24
but yeah i think it's a pretty decent

399.68 --> 405.6
game and i i really do

402.24 --> 409.12
like yeah the more

405.6 --> 411.44
physical things they put in it it's

409.12 --> 414.16
interesting

411.44 --> 416.0
it's a very interesting attempt to

414.16 --> 418.24
become more dynamic with the

416.0 --> 420.56
surroundings something which was utterly

418.24 --> 423.44
lacking in the baldur's gate

420.56 --> 424.96
one and two series because it was just a

423.44 --> 428.08
2d picture

424.96 --> 432.479
with autographic view

428.08 --> 432.479
or yeah autographic view like the

432.88 --> 436.479
like you're looking at it like this like

435.759 --> 439.91900000000004
the

436.479 --> 440.479
top down angular view but you can change

439.919 --> 443.599
that

440.479 --> 445.12
but that's fine i i never had a problem

443.599 --> 446.56
with that it actually makes things a

445.12 --> 449.68
little easier

446.56 --> 451.599
to remember and to orientate

449.68 --> 453.28000000000003
where you are with the characters right

451.599 --> 454.88
because there is trouble with that in

453.28 --> 456.88
this game

454.88 --> 458.24
that's probably not the only one that

456.88 --> 461.199
happened this is typical when you

458.24 --> 461.199
embrace 3d

461.68 --> 465.28000000000003
if you want graphics playwright that

463.759 --> 468.47900000000004
redemption well that's

465.28 --> 471.44
i don't think you can get that on the pc

468.479 --> 474.0
and i'm not particularly interested in

471.44 --> 474.0
graphics

474.479 --> 482.31899999999996
i'm much more interested in game play

477.599 --> 482.319
and interface fluidity

482.72 --> 488.56
you know i i used to want to become a

486.479 --> 490.87899999999996
game designer once and i've

488.56 --> 492.0
already decided very early on is that

490.879 --> 495.52000000000004
anything that i'm going to be

492.0 --> 496.16
part of it has to be fluid like fluid

495.52 --> 499.039
first

496.16 --> 502.40000000000003
then first it has to be fluided then

499.039 --> 502.4
interesting in that order

504.639 --> 507.84000000000003
right anyway

510.479 --> 516.479
but yes i've heard that redemption

512.959 --> 516.4789999999999
series is very popular

517.2 --> 521.839
has been for a while

524.32 --> 529.12
right but yeah as as for the graphics in

527.2 --> 532.0
baldur's gate 3 i had to

529.12 --> 533.44
put everything on the minimal graphicals

532.0 --> 537.04
graphic settings

533.44 --> 540.399
because if i did anything else then

537.04 --> 543.04
yeah everything just goes to crap

540.399 --> 544.8
i don't know whether it's my computer

543.04 --> 547.5999999999999
being too old

544.8 --> 549.92
not quick enough to do it all or whether

547.6 --> 554.9590000000001
it's just the engine that's not really

549.92 --> 554.959
as functional as you as it should be but

555.44 --> 559.6
yeah when i first played it with bigger

557.68 --> 562.399
graphic settings

559.6 --> 564.16
like the cutscenes just would sometimes

562.399 --> 567.279
just completely stall for like

564.16 --> 570.56
several minutes for one frame and all

567.279 --> 572.72
that all that nonsense and breakdown

570.56 --> 573.68
but on minimum graphics everything is

572.72 --> 576.72
absolutely

573.68 --> 581.279
fluid enough there's no more breakdowns

576.72 --> 581.279
cut scenes and all that right

585.6 --> 595.519
what hello sleeping warrior task

590.48 --> 595.519
manager to find yeah yeah

599.68 --> 605.519
i could do that but

603.519 --> 608.0
yeah there's not really much i can do

605.519 --> 610.399
about it anyway

608.0 --> 611.6
i just put down the graphics to minimum

610.399 --> 613.44
settings for the game

611.6 --> 615.279
and then everything works fine and yeah

613.44 --> 618.9590000000001
it might not be the most beautiful it's

615.279 --> 622.32
it looks kind of like oblivion

618.959 --> 627.3599999999999
levels from that time

622.32 --> 627.36
it's like 2012 graphics

628.079 --> 633.92
so it's it's yeah it's pretty good

631.44 --> 636.5600000000001
but like yeah you can definitely there's

633.92 --> 640.24
no suspense of disbelief about it

636.56 --> 647.8389999999999
it's definitely a cgi like that

640.24 --> 647.839
right and i'm fine with that

651.839 --> 661.839
okay hello apt-man is back

663.68 --> 667.1999999999999
right yeah good good point sleeping

665.839 --> 669.9200000000001
warrior

667.2 --> 671.12
well i'm not going to update my computer

669.92 --> 674.7199999999999
it's as simple as that

671.12 --> 677.2
i don't think i really can anymore

674.72 --> 678.399
like the the frame for it it's just too

677.2 --> 680.0
old

678.399 --> 683.12
then i would have to scour for

680.0 --> 686.56
secondhand parts to try and update it

683.12 --> 688.64
right so i am absolutely fine this

686.56 --> 690.8
computer look this computer

688.64 --> 692.0
the way it is built the way i put it

690.8 --> 696.0
together build it

692.0 --> 701.519
based on recommendation of wide research

696.0 --> 705.04
thanks to uh to tweakers.net

701.519 --> 705.92
right it's worked so well i'm not gonna

705.04 --> 708.399
freaking

705.92 --> 709.8389999999999
add a part on just because some new game

708.399 --> 711.839
requires something more

709.839 --> 712.8800000000001
right because i'm gonna then probably

711.839 --> 716.0
break

712.88 --> 720.48
the integrity of the system because

716.0 --> 720.48
it's worked so incredibly well

721.519 --> 727.04
it's like no breakdowns like

724.72 --> 731.279
like when a computer functions that well

727.04 --> 733.5999999999999
you want to keep it as it is

731.279 --> 733.6
right

735.2 --> 738.48
like technically i think it would be

737.519 --> 740.5600000000001
wiser if i

738.48 --> 742.24
need i said i think i'd need to update a

740.56 --> 746.2399999999999
computer it's better to

742.24 --> 750.399
just leave this one and then get a

746.24 --> 754.0790000000001
build entirely new computer from scratch

750.399 --> 756.16
in from the similar in a similar way

754.079 --> 759.279
based on similar advice from tweakers

756.16 --> 761.519
right then when i do that

759.279 --> 764.24
then i got an updated computer and a

761.519 --> 767.279
very functional old computer

764.24 --> 769.44
that i can still use

767.279 --> 770.56
and then if the new computer breaks down

769.44 --> 773.0400000000001
or whatever or it

770.56 --> 774.88
all turns to crap then i still have a

773.04 --> 778.26
completely

774.88 --> 781.37
functioning old computer see

778.26 --> 781.37
[Music]

783.44 --> 788.32
8 gig ram no no no i got much more than

786.32 --> 792.1600000000001
that

788.32 --> 792.1600000000001
no it's not gonna be memory issues

798.0 --> 803.68
right but besides sleeping warrior the

801.12 --> 807.2
game i'm playing is still kind of

803.68 --> 809.5999999999999
admittedly in testing phase

807.2 --> 811.2
and so it's much more likely it's not my

809.6 --> 813.36
computer it's just

811.2 --> 816.399
the graphics engine is not been

813.36 --> 816.399
fine-tuned enough

819.6 --> 829.839
what p

822.639 --> 829.839
c benchmark

833.68 --> 836.2399999999999
okay

839.36 --> 845.12
they will show you how does that work

848.24 --> 852.16
is it like a youtube series or something

850.56 --> 854.0
they will show you what like how does

852.16 --> 857.8389999999999
that work

854.0 --> 857.839
so the company

861.6 --> 864.48
i'll take it out

868.01 --> 872.399
[Music]

869.199 --> 872.399
okay it's a tool

883.44 --> 885.839
okay

887.36 --> 891.76
a website right well i googled the name

890.24 --> 894.8
and

891.76 --> 899.12
nothing specific popped up several

894.8 --> 913.8389999999999
user benchmark pc game benchmark

899.12 --> 913.839
that's it

915.68 --> 918.079
hmm

919.839 --> 927.44
okay that is kind of interesting

924.32 --> 930.48
maybe i'll check it out later right but

927.44 --> 930.9590000000001
again i don't really have a problem with

930.48 --> 934.0
it

930.959 --> 936.16
you get it i don't care the graphics

934.0 --> 939.6
can't run on maximum settings

936.16 --> 941.279
i don't care it's fine i don't really

939.6 --> 943.6
care about graphics

941.279 --> 945.36
i abandoned the care for that a long

943.6 --> 947.0400000000001
time ago

945.36 --> 948.5600000000001
when it turns out that games that are

947.04 --> 951.5999999999999
more focused on graphics

948.56 --> 953.5189999999999
tend to get boring really quickly

951.6 --> 955.279
compared to games that are not so much

953.519 --> 958.72
focused on graphics and much more on

955.279 --> 958.72
gameplay and interface

958.8 --> 969.8389999999999
and strategy and all that

962.399 --> 969.839
all right

972.56 --> 979.7589999999999
pc game benchmark okay yeah i'm gonna

976.399 --> 983.839
bookmark it and put it in between

979.759 --> 983.839
some other stuff

996.48 --> 1004.24
right unfortunate reality yeah

999.6 --> 1004.24
me neither total

1009.36 --> 1014.16
all right frames per second yeah exactly

1012.079 --> 1016.2399999999999
it has to be fluid

1014.16 --> 1017.36
and with strategical games that's

1016.24 --> 1019.6
essential if

1017.36 --> 1021.04
if there's like none if there's

1019.6 --> 1023.839
irregular fluid

1021.04 --> 1026.8799999999999
fluidity in strategic games it's

1023.839 --> 1026.88
completely ruined

1027.36 --> 1032.6399999999999
yeah which makes like all the older

1029.52 --> 1036.559
games really great it's almost like

1032.64 --> 1038.16
a lot of games actually age better

1036.559 --> 1039.6789999999999
it's like better when they're old

1038.16 --> 1042.16
because computers

1039.679 --> 1044.16
generally can't can handle them

1042.16 --> 1046.64
perfectly and then they just work

1044.16 --> 1046.64
optimal

1047.919 --> 1055.1200000000001
what what are you talking about

1051.6 --> 1055.12
is philip what

1062.24 --> 1065.76
anyway i don't know why i'm talking

1064.08 --> 1066.96
about computers right now it's my

1065.76 --> 1070.08
birthday

1066.96 --> 1070.08
i'm not a computer

1070.16 --> 1081.8400000000001
at least i think i'm not

1092.84 --> 1098.609
forty-one

1095.51 --> 1098.609
[Music]

1100.96 --> 1107.2
yeah yesterday uh the flat earth debate

1103.44 --> 1110.4
again i was still very active on there

1107.2 --> 1110.4
there there

1112.4 --> 1116.5590000000002
and that been watching lots of south

1114.799 --> 1120.4
park

1116.559 --> 1122.24
playing the game and oh yeah patricia

1120.4 --> 1125.039
steer went live and watched that yeah i

1122.24 --> 1128.48
did have a very late night

1125.039 --> 1131.76
i stayed up till 5.

1128.48 --> 1135.84
it was kind of similar feelings as i

1131.76 --> 1139.039
experienced yesterday except this time

1135.84 --> 1140.72
no problems i don't know what it is man

1139.039 --> 1142.559
if there's just something in the air or

1140.72 --> 1146.0
something

1142.559 --> 1149.28
like an energy i do have more

1146.0 --> 1151.36
issues with sound resonation

1149.28 --> 1153.44
side effects in the last few days where

1151.36 --> 1154.8799999999999
just when i try to sleep it's just like

1153.44 --> 1156.4
almost like i feel like i'm being

1154.88 --> 1160.0
attacked

1156.4 --> 1165.8400000000001
with a sonic weapon that's just

1160.0 --> 1165.84
giving tones in certain places just

1166.32 --> 1169.52
to get to my nerves or something i don't

1168.72 --> 1173.2
know what it is

1169.52 --> 1173.2
and other times i don't hear it

1173.28 --> 1178.48
or hear it's rather feel it's not even

1175.6 --> 1182.0
that i hear it it's just that

1178.48 --> 1186.4
i can almost like virtually just

1182.0 --> 1188.0
see where the sound is

1186.4 --> 1190.96
because it seems to just be like

1188.0 --> 1193.039
resonance based

1190.96 --> 1194.559
almost like it's being summoned right in

1193.039 --> 1197.44
the spot where i'm sleeping

1194.559 --> 1197.44
very annoying

1204.24 --> 1210.159
yeah i don't have a car

1207.52 --> 1213.52
i don't have a woman and i don't know a

1210.159 --> 1216.3200000000002
place i would go out for dinner

1213.52 --> 1217.2
if anything i might pick up a woman if

1216.32 --> 1220.32
i'd have a car

1217.2 --> 1223.76
and then make dinner for her organic

1220.32 --> 1225.9189999999999
arwen style let's see how she likes that

1223.76 --> 1229.12
right it's not like it's never been on

1225.919 --> 1229.1200000000001
my mind before but

1229.76 --> 1235.84
yeah not right now

1237.36 --> 1241.84
like i i wouldn't even want to yeah face

1240.799 --> 1244.0
a woman

1241.84 --> 1249.84
with these with yeah the quality of the

1244.0 --> 1249.84
clothes i'm wearing right now

1259.36 --> 1263.84
all right but who knows who knows where

1262.24 --> 1266.96
it's gonna go this year

1263.84 --> 1270.72
especially in the next week

1266.96 --> 1272.559
two weeks i don't know

1270.72 --> 1276.56
still waiting if something big is gonna

1272.559 --> 1280.359
happen in the crypto situation

1276.56 --> 1280.359
[Music]

1281.919 --> 1287.2800000000002
on my end that is

1285.039 --> 1288.48
i don't think it like what was predicted

1287.28 --> 1291.12
is very

1288.48 --> 1291.76
is anchored to some kind of specific

1291.12 --> 1294.08
event

1291.76 --> 1295.28
that would require to happen in order

1294.08 --> 1298.799
for that to happen

1295.28 --> 1301.52
i think it's like already set

1298.799 --> 1302.72
separate like it's going like how it was

1301.52 --> 1305.36
taught me is that it's

1302.72 --> 1307.52
literally just going to happen not

1305.36 --> 1310.799
really dependent on anything else it's

1307.52 --> 1312.96
just in the works it was arranged

1310.799 --> 1312.96
so

1318.48 --> 1322.24
it's kind of weird thinking about it

1321.44 --> 1325.76
because

1322.24 --> 1327.84
i was in ways like very demoralized

1325.76 --> 1329.6
and i said no i'm not gonna hope because

1327.84 --> 1332.48
it's just a waste of time and there's so

1329.6 --> 1336.8799999999999
many false hope so many instabilities

1332.48 --> 1336.88
you can't rely on hope but now

1337.76 --> 1342.0
even with that attitude it's still like

1340.24 --> 1344.08
really like yeah but it might

1342.0 --> 1346.4
really just be around the corner and

1344.08 --> 1349.12
this time it's not just some fantasy to

1346.4 --> 1352.159
keep yourself going or anything

1349.12 --> 1356.1589999999999
like it might actually just happen

1352.159 --> 1356.159
so i'm really looking forward to that

1357.039 --> 1363.84
you're late here we go again yes i know

1360.32 --> 1364.3999999999999
no you're not late i'm early i decided

1363.84 --> 1367.84
to

1364.4 --> 1369.8400000000001
start at the weekday times

1367.84 --> 1372.72
on this saturday because i didn't have a

1369.84 --> 1374.72
live show yesterday

1372.72 --> 1377.44
i didn't really tell anyone i just

1374.72 --> 1380.88
thought now i'm just gonna go live

1377.44 --> 1384.799
but hello welcome to the show and hello

1380.88 --> 1384.7990000000002
chris la jambe

1387.6 --> 1393.48
uh watching patricia yeah yeah me too

1390.36 --> 1393.4799999999998
[Music]

1400.559 --> 1408.1589999999999
yeah she really is an amazing woman

1403.76 --> 1411.679
isn't she and it's really it's kind of

1408.159 --> 1411.679
i don't know what to think about it

1412.08 --> 1415.36
it's not negative but she would be like

1414.88 --> 1418.24
oh

1415.36 --> 1419.12
look at my figure like yeah i'm not

1418.24 --> 1422.799
perfect

1419.12 --> 1427.12
like excuse me yes you are

1422.799 --> 1427.12
when it comes to that figure damn woman

1429.44 --> 1431.8400000000001
uh

1432.799 --> 1438.24
right but that's not all that's that's

1435.76 --> 1440.64
not all that is there

1438.24 --> 1441.36
that's there to her i don't know how to

1440.64 --> 1443.76
say this

1441.36 --> 1445.36
right but yeah that was she had a show

1443.76 --> 1448.64
yesterday it was really great

1445.36 --> 1451.279
lots of people in chat that i know

1448.64 --> 1452.159
it's like the entire flatter scene or

1451.279 --> 1455.039
seemingly

1452.159 --> 1455.0390000000002
big part of it just

1457.279 --> 1460.559
we really do appreciate patricia doing

1459.6 --> 1465.4399999999998
her thing and then

1460.559 --> 1465.44
are drawn to the chat all together

1469.36 --> 1473.12
do i really live next door to nathan

1472.159 --> 1476.64
oakley

1473.12 --> 1476.6399999999999
well on the internet i do

1476.72 --> 1480.24
on the internet he's my neighbor

1482.799 --> 1487.84
but yeah depending on yeah what you

1485.76 --> 1491.76
consider next door i think that

1487.84 --> 1494.6399999999999
by australian standards nathan is pretty

1491.76 --> 1494.64
much next door

1498.24 --> 1503.279
it's it's just a few hundred miles away

1500.72 --> 1503.279
that's all

1508.96 --> 1512.96
do i think carl sagan wants why would

1511.679 --> 1516.0800000000002
you say that

1512.96 --> 1519.279
why the hell would you think that carl

1516.08 --> 1519.279
sagan is a truther

1523.12 --> 1529.84
what has he ever said that made him a

1526.84 --> 1529.84
truther

1537.2 --> 1543.8400000000001
yeah dmk 2020 i live in the netherlands

1540.799 --> 1543.84
this is public knowledge

1571.52 --> 1576.4
well look territ

1574.559 --> 1578.6399999999999
well he was a liar and he knew he liked

1576.4 --> 1584.96
then why would you ask me do you think

1578.64 --> 1588.5590000000002
carl sagan was a truther

1584.96 --> 1590.88
either you misformulated it or yeah

1588.559 --> 1594.08
the way you formulate it's like you

1590.88 --> 1594.0800000000002
tried to set me up

1594.32 --> 1599.76
because he's not a truther why would you

1597.279 --> 1604.159
think that i would

1599.76 --> 1604.1589999999999
think he might be a truther i never said

1610.84 --> 1617.6
that

1612.559 --> 1617.6
where is dmk 2020 please just

1618.4 --> 1622.4
take care of your sentence structure

1623.84 --> 1627.84
and he's in england

1638.96 --> 1645.76
i mean he must also have right so

1642.399 --> 1649.84
curiosity equals truther no

1645.76 --> 1651.84
no it's not just because truthers need

1649.84 --> 1653.52
curiosity to get anywhere doesn't mean

1651.84 --> 1656.32
that just because you have curiosity

1653.52 --> 1656.32
you're a truther

1658.399 --> 1661.6
no he was a wizard

1665.679 --> 1669.1200000000001
and of course he was curious about

1667.36 --> 1673.279
reality

1669.12 --> 1673.279
you would have to be otherwise you can't

1673.679 --> 1679.919
fabricate wizardry that well

1677.12 --> 1681.1999999999998
you can't do it without curiosity for

1679.919 --> 1684.88
actual reality is

1681.2 --> 1684.88
that it's not gonna work out

1686.159 --> 1692.159
because yeah lies

1690.0 --> 1693.679
the best lies are the ones that reflect

1692.159 --> 1696.3200000000002
the most truth

1693.679 --> 1696.88
so that are in some way based on real

1696.32 --> 1698.6399999999999
things

1696.88 --> 1700.5590000000002
if you don't have any curiosity you

1698.64 --> 1702.48
won't find out what those real things

1700.559 --> 1704.0
are in order to create effective

1702.48 --> 1711.84
wizardry

1704.0 --> 1711.84
right takes one to know one yeah

1718.04 --> 1721.18
[Music]

1729.039 --> 1734.32
i love tara 306 i'm sure he was told

1731.919 --> 1734.3200000000002
things

1734.559 --> 1736.799
look

1737.84 --> 1744.559
i've been told things guess what

1741.12 --> 1747.76
i didn't freaking believe them or i did

1744.559 --> 1750.96
it messed me up then i forgot about it

1747.76 --> 1752.559
right a lot of people get told a lot of

1750.96 --> 1755.039
things does that mean that

1752.559 --> 1755.9189999999999
those things are absolute truth or are

1755.039 --> 1758.559
they just

1755.919 --> 1760.64
enough truth in order to push pull

1758.559 --> 1763.12
people over a threshold

1760.64 --> 1765.279
and then some lies in certain on top of

1763.12 --> 1768.1589999999999
that to control them in their moment of

1765.279 --> 1771.12
realization yeah yeah yeah this next

1768.159 --> 1771.1200000000001
level wizardry

1771.76 --> 1774.08
right

1778.24 --> 1781.279
but seriously a guy like that how could

1780.0 --> 1784.559
he possibly not

1781.279 --> 1784.559
have been told things

1792.24 --> 1809.84
nd gt i don't know who that is

1815.2 --> 1819.279
do i think he follows flat earth on

1817.039 --> 1822.48
youtube absolutely not

1819.279 --> 1826.399
i don't think so

1822.48 --> 1829.52
well absolutely not enough he might have

1826.399 --> 1833.52
taken a look here occasionally

1829.52 --> 1835.9189999999999
but i think look neil degrasse

1833.52 --> 1838.32
look i'm using my empathy skills in

1835.919 --> 1841.2
general right and neela grass

1838.32 --> 1843.36
i don't think he even cares that much

1841.2 --> 1844.64
about cosmogeny and mechanics and

1843.36 --> 1847.9189999999999
physics

1844.64 --> 1851.3600000000001
i think he that part is really

1847.919 --> 1854.0800000000002
handed out to him partially maybe he

1851.36 --> 1855.1999999999998
has people which he discusses because

1854.08 --> 1858.8799999999999
he's much more

1855.2 --> 1862.799
interested in being convincing

1858.88 --> 1865.2
and that part of the wizardry much more

1862.799 --> 1865.9189999999999
in the social interactions that's where

1865.2 --> 1868.72
his

1865.919 --> 1870.7990000000002
power lies i don't think he even cares

1868.72 --> 1873.279
that much

1870.799 --> 1874.72
he's much more interested in how to get

1873.279 --> 1878.88
people interested

1874.72 --> 1881.519
rather than the the mechanics

1878.88 --> 1882.3990000000001
have you ever noticed that he's always

1881.519 --> 1884.72
better at

1882.399 --> 1886.08
being kind of interesting to watch in

1884.72 --> 1888.96
some way than he has been

1886.08 --> 1891.36
good at explaining mechanics right

1888.96 --> 1893.3600000000001
that's very telling

1891.36 --> 1896.399
tells you something about the individual

1893.36 --> 1896.399
where their strengths are

1898.799 --> 1902.08
he tweets and makes fun of effie yeah

1900.48 --> 1905.2
well who doesn't

1902.08 --> 1909.039
that's yeah especially people that are

1905.2 --> 1909.039
not informed make fun of flat earth

1911.8 --> 1916.399
[Music]

1914.08 --> 1918.6399999999999
because if you are informed about flat

1916.399 --> 1922.1589999999999
earth then you still stick to that ball

1918.64 --> 1925.919
for whatever reason by choice

1922.159 --> 1928.5590000000002
then you know how messed up it is

1925.919 --> 1930.48
in the sense that you have no real

1928.559 --> 1932.48
defense against flat earth so the more

1930.48 --> 1934.64
you learn about flat earth

1932.48 --> 1938.08
the less you're gonna talk about it if

1934.64 --> 1938.0800000000002
you're still on the ball side

1940.399 --> 1944.2399999999998
unless you're in an absolute trench

1942.48 --> 1949.84
zealot and then you can

1944.24 --> 1949.84
stop yourself right

1953.76 --> 1958.48
but you can literally pick them out

1958.88 --> 1962.48
it's the ones that really don't know

1961.36 --> 1965.6789999999999
about flat earth

1962.48 --> 1965.679
that make fun of it

1966.559 --> 1970.96
that make fun of the straw man

1968.679 --> 1971.3600000000001
interpretations of our model and all

1970.96 --> 1974.559
that

1971.36 --> 1977.76
remember and they do that

1974.559 --> 1979.44
because they don't know what flat earth

1977.76 --> 1980.64
is really about what actually is

1979.44 --> 1982.96
happening in there

1980.64 --> 1983.919
what is being discussed because if they

1982.96 --> 1986.96
would

1983.919 --> 1988.64
they would just shut up about it leave

1986.96 --> 1990.799
it be

1988.64 --> 1993.6000000000001
because it's freaking dangerous for the

1990.799 --> 2005.84
belief system

1993.6 --> 2005.84
right think about it

2025.08 --> 2028.1899999999998
[Music]

2039.039 --> 2041.36
right

2042.24 --> 2046.24
but yeah knew the grass got himself into

2044.399 --> 2048.24
a real pickle by basically

2046.24 --> 2051.599
defending coriola's effect the way he

2048.24 --> 2061.839
did with the ball and all that

2051.599 --> 2061.839
that ball is gonna weigh heavily on him

2066.8 --> 2070.32
because most things that he's claimed

2069.04 --> 2073.52
haven't even been that

2070.32 --> 2075.76
off but yet the ball deviating because

2073.52 --> 2078.8
of the coriolis spin of the earth right

2075.76 --> 2081.2000000000003
that that is just that was one of the

2078.8 --> 2081.2000000000003
worst

2082.0 --> 2089.839
suffering from coriolis fires maybe

2100.839 --> 2103.839
um

2107.04 --> 2113.44
nothing rivers on titan what

2110.32 --> 2115.6800000000003
yeah but look if if the earth were a

2113.44 --> 2117.599
ball in outer space and the gas pressure

2115.68 --> 2122.24
could stick to the ball

2117.599 --> 2125.6800000000003
in the face of the outer space vacuum

2122.24 --> 2125.68
then why couldn't

2125.92 --> 2131.839
titan have rivers of methane there it

2129.68 --> 2131.839
see

2136.24 --> 2145.839
you gotta talk about something right

2146.88 --> 2153.839
especially like the what is it

2150.72 --> 2155.68
all the diamonds the fly was it saturn's

2153.839 --> 2156.64
diamonds or whatever was the jupiter

2155.68 --> 2158.8799999999997
diamonds

2156.64 --> 2160.7999999999997
like yeah that's a good subject of

2158.88 --> 2164.2400000000002
virtual things to talk about

2160.8 --> 2166.0
so that people start imagining it right

2164.24 --> 2168.3999999999996
that's that's what it's all about it's

2166.0 --> 2169.119
all about just handing you pictures so

2168.4 --> 2173.839
you can

2169.119 --> 2173.839
imagine that virtual realm

2186.0 --> 2189.44
at the same time he would know how silly

2188.079 --> 2192.1600000000003
it is would he

2189.44 --> 2193.44
would he look territ why don't you think

2192.16 --> 2196.7999999999997
about it

2193.44 --> 2199.76
like i do freaking baller defense

2196.8 --> 2202.32
emulations on the flat earth debate

2199.76 --> 2202.32
sometimes

2202.48 --> 2206.72
you don't feel silly when you do it

2207.839 --> 2214.0789999999997
you just do it and just let

2210.96 --> 2217.28
the image take [ __ ]

2214.079 --> 2217.28
doesn't feel silly

2218.72 --> 2223.1189999999997
it's only after you get completely

2220.72 --> 2225.2
honest about the situation and lets

2223.119 --> 2227.28
things sink in that are kind of personal

2225.2 --> 2230.0789999999997
and you don't want

2227.28 --> 2232.48
to realize them that's when you feel

2230.079 --> 2232.48
silly

2234.96 --> 2242.0
he loves to lie no you are literally

2237.839 --> 2246.24
where are you getting this from

2242.0 --> 2246.24
how do you know he even knows he's lying

2247.66 --> 2251.1189999999997
[Music]

2249.04 --> 2253.119
i'm sure he's like kind of playing

2251.119 --> 2257.839
around

2253.119 --> 2257.839
with some things a little

2278.8 --> 2284.2400000000002
well tara 306 yeah neil degrasse tyson

2282.16 --> 2284.96
doesn't know the earth is flat well yeah

2284.24 --> 2287.68
maybe

2284.96 --> 2290.0
he doesn't allow himself to go there

2287.68 --> 2294.48
maybe he has taken on

2290.0 --> 2294.48
like trencher mechanics like that

2294.88 --> 2298.8
because i'm pretty sure that among the

2296.88 --> 2300.4
higher circles the ones that really put

2298.8 --> 2303.599
out the stories they do

2300.4 --> 2305.44
tell each other like just never never

2303.599 --> 2307.6800000000003
look into it

2305.44 --> 2309.28
or or maybe they don't even have to say

2307.68 --> 2313.839
it it's like

2309.28 --> 2313.8390000000004
you just copy that from the others

2319.04 --> 2322.56
and who knows what neil degrasse tyson

2321.119 --> 2326.8
really knows maybe he

2322.56 --> 2329.92
is like like underneath it all he

2326.8 --> 2332.32
like doesn't know what it really is

2329.92 --> 2334.16
hasn't even gone to that part yet

2332.32 --> 2341.839
because he's just been too busy

2334.16 --> 2341.839
following the program has been ordered

2352.839 --> 2355.839
so

2357.52 --> 2361.2
yeah yeah whatever

2362.96 --> 2366.8
yeah you're you're putting words in his

2366.839 --> 2369.839
mouth

2370.83 --> 2374.02
[Music]

2376.4 --> 2380.1600000000003
yeah moth eyes sure

2380.56 --> 2385.359
sure has been told the earth might be

2382.64 --> 2397.839
flat did he believe it however

2385.359 --> 2397.839
what did that do to him

2400.64 --> 2404.7999999999997
oh he said that well did what did he

2403.28 --> 2407.2000000000003
mean with it

2404.8 --> 2409.04
did he make it very convenient for every

2407.2 --> 2410.3999999999996
flat earther to believe that he meant no

2409.04 --> 2414.0
no the earth is

2410.4 --> 2417.76
flat as in not the ball or was he

2414.0 --> 2420.0
actually saying no no it is flat

2417.76 --> 2421.599
it's it's like it's it's pretty damn

2420.0 --> 2423.92
flat it's still a ball though

2421.599 --> 2425.839
you know all those types of things it's

2423.92 --> 2427.6800000000003
just like oh at best we've disproven the

2425.839 --> 2430.16
radius yeah that is freaking hilarious

2427.68 --> 2433.7599999999998
to hear from a flat earth perspective

2430.16 --> 2436.72
to them it doesn't have the same weight

2433.76 --> 2437.92
it doesn't mean the same thing to them

2436.72 --> 2441.4399999999996
it's just like no it's just

2437.92 --> 2445.44
a calculation error at best

2441.44 --> 2448.2400000000002
right you got to step

2445.44 --> 2449.2000000000003
out of the flat earth perspective to

2448.24 --> 2453.68
understand

2449.2 --> 2457.1189999999997
what it's like to them

2453.68 --> 2459.7599999999998
don't don't obsess over being

2457.119 --> 2460.6400000000003
right and on the right side it doesn't

2459.76 --> 2463.6800000000003
help you

2460.64 --> 2466.0789999999997
it just makes you polarized

2463.68 --> 2468.3999999999996
and incapable of understanding the

2466.079 --> 2470.7200000000003
mindset of the other side that is not

2468.4 --> 2470.7200000000003
right

2476.4 --> 2485.76
i said it as a joke okay

2481.76 --> 2488.079
if you say so who knows man maybe he

2485.76 --> 2490.8
by now has converted to flat earth but

2488.079 --> 2494.6400000000003
he's just stuck to the job

2490.8 --> 2497.52
who knows maybe he just thinks that

2494.64 --> 2499.44
making flatter jokes is very popular

2497.52 --> 2501.28
apparently we'll give him some cred i

2499.44 --> 2504.2400000000002
don't know

2501.28 --> 2505.2000000000003
i would have to interview him and then

2504.24 --> 2508.319
yeah get a

2505.2 --> 2510.64
honest opinion from his side

2508.319 --> 2511.839
which is not guaranteed of course yeah

2510.64 --> 2514.96
that stuff is flat

2511.839 --> 2517.359
but that's talking about how it looks

2514.96 --> 2517.359
again

2521.92 --> 2527.52
these are all these little trinkets that

2525.28 --> 2529.3590000000004
i don't know flat earthers that are just

2527.52 --> 2530.72
saying like no the earth is flat we know

2529.359 --> 2533.2799999999997
what's going on

2530.72 --> 2534.0
and then flat earthers like to put those

2533.28 --> 2536.48
moments

2534.0 --> 2538.319
like gems on their armor and think oh

2536.48 --> 2540.88
look look at all the

2538.319 --> 2543.119
globers actually telling us in their

2540.88 --> 2545.359
moments of honesty the earth is flat

2543.119 --> 2546.48
yeah yeah it that's not what it means to

2545.359 --> 2550.72
them

2546.48 --> 2554.56
that's what you see in it understand

2550.72 --> 2554.56
it's not what it is to them

2555.52 --> 2559.68
and actually doing that makes us in

2558.64 --> 2562.56
their eyes

2559.68 --> 2563.68
look kind of weird because they know

2562.56 --> 2566.64
what they meant

2563.68 --> 2569.1189999999997
by saying that and then they're watching

2566.64 --> 2571.5989999999997
how we are squirting over them

2569.119 --> 2573.359
sort of saying something that we

2571.599 --> 2574.88
interpret as that they're saying the

2573.359 --> 2576.56
earth is flat right

2574.88 --> 2578.4
that's what's happening that's what's

2576.56 --> 2581.68
happening in reality

2578.4 --> 2586.1600000000003
all right yeah just because you won the

2581.68 --> 2589.1189999999997
argument doesn't mean it's over

2586.16 --> 2591.2
doesn't mean like oh oh i've won well

2589.119 --> 2594.4
i'm just gonna sit on this

2591.2 --> 2596.8799999999997
win and do absolutely nothing get

2594.4 --> 2599.28
maximum polarized no longer try to

2596.88 --> 2602.079
figure out what's actually happening

2599.28 --> 2605.0400000000004
and how things are changing and what the

2602.079 --> 2608.8
other one's thinking because i won

2605.04 --> 2611.92
yeah that's bad

2608.8 --> 2615.28
that's bad to do that

2611.92 --> 2615.28
you got to keep developing

2615.44 --> 2621.839
just because we won the argument doesn't

2617.359 --> 2621.839
mean the war is over or even the fight

2622.8 --> 2625.92
because arguments

2626.48 --> 2634.4
they don't have as much weight in this

2630.079 --> 2637.52
expanding system that relies on lies

2634.4 --> 2637.52
and spin doctoring

2647.68 --> 2651.359
right and hey it doesn't mean that we

2650.4 --> 2654.319
can't just make

2651.359 --> 2656.0
fun of saying of yeah neil the rest i

2654.319 --> 2658.88
say that stuff is flat

2656.0 --> 2659.92
smacking that ball and then interpreting

2658.88 --> 2662.7200000000003
how we like it

2659.92 --> 2663.359
right yeah that's that's fine just don't

2662.72 --> 2666.0
think it's

2663.359 --> 2668.4
actually literally like that if you do

2666.0 --> 2669.28
that and you go to outsider saying it

2668.4 --> 2674.2400000000002
like that

2669.28 --> 2674.2400000000002
that makes you look like an idiot

2674.72 --> 2681.2799999999997
and you might be right about your

2678.48 --> 2683.04
baseline assumption of what the world is

2681.28 --> 2684.1600000000003
that doesn't prevent you from making you

2683.04 --> 2687.44
look like an idiot

2684.16 --> 2689.2
outside of even the conditioning about

2687.44 --> 2690.16
if they know you're a flat earther that

2689.2 --> 2693.2
they're going to think of

2690.16 --> 2693.5989999999997
you like that anyway yeah outside of

2693.2 --> 2696.96
that

2693.599 --> 2699.52
it makes you look like an idiot just

2696.96 --> 2700.96
realize that yeah just because you're on

2699.52 --> 2705.839
a winning site

2700.96 --> 2705.839
doesn't mean you can't fail

2711.29 --> 2714.44
[Music]

2719.62 --> 2722.77
[Music]

2741.28 --> 2745.119
why do you keep asking these questions

2743.359 --> 2747.68
terret

2745.119 --> 2749.6800000000003
what you're you're gonna just name list

2747.68 --> 2751.839
of every freaking person in the world do

2749.68 --> 2754.96
they know the earth is flat dude

2751.839 --> 2758.0789999999997
no i don't think anything i don't think

2754.96 --> 2760.319
any of them know

2758.079 --> 2762.2400000000002
i think they all heard it probably they

2760.319 --> 2764.24
all heard they were all told by

2762.24 --> 2766.24
somebody the earth is flat did they

2764.24 --> 2767.839
believe it or did they think hey we're

2766.24 --> 2770.24
being psychologically attacked

2767.839 --> 2771.52
by somebody that's trying to fool us and

2770.24 --> 2774.7999999999997
then they ignore it

2771.52 --> 2775.7599999999998
yeah why don't you freaking think about

2774.8 --> 2781.28
that

2775.76 --> 2781.28
tear it think about it

2782.079 --> 2787.44
every individual has their own response

2785.92 --> 2790.079
to information

2787.44 --> 2790.56
just because you now know the earth is

2790.079 --> 2792.319
flat

2790.56 --> 2794.96
doesn't mean that if somebody's told the

2792.319 --> 2798.48
earth is flat on the inside

2794.96 --> 2798.48
that they're just going to believe it

2800.56 --> 2805.359
and i am a living example of that i

2803.52 --> 2806.56
think i'm pretty smart yeah well i've

2805.359 --> 2809.92
told it was flat

2806.56 --> 2812.56
several times and i literally

2809.92 --> 2814.319
didn't believe it i got into it first

2812.56 --> 2816.4
through suspense of disbelief

2814.319 --> 2817.599
and then stepped away because i didn't

2816.4 --> 2819.6800000000003
believe it you know why

2817.599 --> 2821.2000000000003
because i didn't want to believe it i

2819.68 --> 2824.16
was afraid of it

2821.2 --> 2825.9199999999996
i was afraid it was mind control out to

2824.16 --> 2828.72
destroy me

2825.92 --> 2830.4
yeah to isolate me from the comfort of

2828.72 --> 2830.9599999999996
society that's what i thought it was

2830.4 --> 2833.2000000000003
that's why

2830.96 --> 2834.96
even though i was fully explained and

2833.2 --> 2838.3999999999996
could emulate

2834.96 --> 2842.4
the mechanics i still didn't

2838.4 --> 2845.52
believe it yeah

2842.4 --> 2848.7200000000003
you think i'm the only one

2845.52 --> 2850.72
why don't you think about it

2848.72 --> 2853.359
no i'm not chill i'm trying to get

2850.72 --> 2853.359
through to you

2856.72 --> 2862.0
trying to get this habit out of the way

2858.96 --> 2862.0
you think about it

2863.44 --> 2866.16
do you know

2867.119 --> 2870.6400000000003
why would i know i've never met any of

2868.8 --> 2874.4
these people

2870.64 --> 2876.72
well i have to go by is what i see and

2874.4 --> 2880.2400000000002
hear of them and my analysis and my

2876.72 --> 2882.24
reflections on my own experiences

2880.24 --> 2884.0789999999997
and i know that there's a whole swath of

2882.24 --> 2887.68
people out there even with power

2884.079 --> 2890.96
and information they'll literally ignore

2887.68 --> 2892.5589999999997
filter out complete parts of information

2890.96 --> 2894.16
because they're afraid of it

2892.559 --> 2896.4
because they are afraid they're being

2894.16 --> 2897.2
fooled or being psychologically attacked

2896.4 --> 2901.839
with it

2897.2 --> 2901.839
so they just filter it out

2914.48 --> 2929.839
and in that sense i'm probably being

2916.64 --> 2929.839
filtered out in many ways

2932.559 --> 2936.1600000000003
and hey maybe have you ever considered

2935.04 --> 2940.16
that maybe

2936.16 --> 2944.3999999999996
the truth is a psyop

2940.16 --> 2947.52
because you can't handle the truth

2944.4 --> 2949.04
huh huh

2947.52 --> 2950.8
what do you think that means you can't

2949.04 --> 2954.88
handle the truth in

2950.8 --> 2958.0
how many ways is that true

2954.88 --> 2959.76
think about it every person is an

2958.0 --> 2963.119
individual

2959.76 --> 2965.119
with a growing cycle in ignorance

2963.119 --> 2966.2400000000002
getting informed learning how to deal

2965.119 --> 2969.839
with things

2966.24 --> 2974.0789999999997
how will they respond to the information

2969.839 --> 2977.119
yeah just because you figured it out

2974.079 --> 2979.8390000000004
got over that obstacle and now know

2977.119 --> 2981.44
what ills the world like that doesn't

2979.839 --> 2983.2
mean that everybody else just going to

2981.44 --> 2987.28
do it the same way

2983.2 --> 2987.2799999999997
doesn't work like that at all

2987.29 --> 2990.389
[Applause]

2994.88 --> 2998.1600000000003
and the ball our trenches are the living

2996.64 --> 3000.7999999999997
proof of that by the way

2998.16 --> 3002.48
because they will be confronted by it

3000.8 --> 3005.3590000000004
every single day

3002.48 --> 3007.119
and ignore it every single day and learn

3005.359 --> 3010.16
the arguments by heart

3007.119 --> 3012.0
without knowing them they will know

3010.16 --> 3014.5589999999997
exactly what we say just to

3012.0 --> 3016.559
recognize on what to avoid they will

3014.559 --> 3017.119
know it by heart they will know every

3016.559 --> 3020.7200000000003
step

3017.119 --> 3024.2400000000002
of what we do by heart without

3020.72 --> 3025.359
actually pairing at the information

3024.24 --> 3028.64
itself

3025.359 --> 3031.04
yeah that's how far it goes with them

3028.64 --> 3034.96
because they're really good at ignorance

3031.04 --> 3038.96
they've weaponized their ignorance

3034.96 --> 3042.96
right but the general people

3038.96 --> 3044.96
they also have these mechanics

3042.96 --> 3047.04
not necessarily weaponized ignorance but

3044.96 --> 3050.559
they will definitely use it you

3047.04 --> 3052.4
have to or this will this world out

3050.559 --> 3055.2000000000003
there the people

3052.4 --> 3055.76
corporations the media it will kill you

3055.2 --> 3058.16
it will

3055.76 --> 3069.8390000000004
kill you if you don't and people learn

3058.16 --> 3069.839
that very young

3070.48 --> 3073.65
[Music]

3080.839 --> 3083.839
so

3091.76 --> 3094.48
well really

3095.76 --> 3100.7200000000003
i wow moth eyes okay most people are

3099.28 --> 3102.0
jacked letters unless their favorite

3100.72 --> 3105.52
celebrities tell them

3102.0 --> 3105.52
might be could be

3106.4 --> 3110.1600000000003
in general there's a whole a whole bunch

3109.68 --> 3112.0789999999997
of people

3110.16 --> 3115.04
out there especially the kind of

3112.079 --> 3118.48
naturally good willing ones

3115.04 --> 3121.04
that wouldn't do anything for themselves

3118.48 --> 3124.8
but if somebody they like told them then

3121.04 --> 3128.0
they would do anything in ways

3124.8 --> 3131.28
i have that too i do

3128.0 --> 3136.24
i'd much more of motivated to do things

3131.28 --> 3136.2400000000002
for other people in the moment that is

3136.48 --> 3143.92
to help out to be very functional

3140.16 --> 3147.2799999999997
and energetic in helping out

3143.92 --> 3153.6800000000003
then i'm in general about just doing my

3147.28 --> 3156.1600000000003
own things

3153.68 --> 3156.16
but yet

3156.88 --> 3162.4
that's just a way of how do i do things

3160.0 --> 3164.72
it's not that i go out and try to find

3162.4 --> 3167.92
people to help all of the time but if

3164.72 --> 3171.359
the opportunity is there and it is

3167.92 --> 3173.839
suitable and like wanted

3171.359 --> 3175.2
then i will help i'm like available for

3173.839 --> 3177.2799999999997
that people know that and they

3175.2 --> 3181.839
yeah i'm surprised that people don't ask

3177.28 --> 3181.8390000000004
me more

3192.839 --> 3195.839
um

3213.92 --> 3223.839
do astronauts know the earth is flat

3217.599 --> 3223.839
no not necessarily

3224.319 --> 3236.319
i don't know how they do it with the

3226.64 --> 3240.4
astronauts tear at 306.

3236.319 --> 3240.88
i think that what it comes down to is

3240.4 --> 3243.6800000000003
that

3240.88 --> 3246.96
the astronauts simply are tasked with

3243.68 --> 3249.52
fooling everybody that it's possible

3246.96 --> 3250.16
well they might at the same time be

3249.52 --> 3252.88
promised

3250.16 --> 3255.04
like yeah one day we will figure out how

3252.88 --> 3257.599
to actually do it we just can't do it we

3255.04 --> 3259.68
have to bluff to everyone that we can

3257.599 --> 3261.599
and that might get a whole bunch of them

3259.68 --> 3263.2799999999997
going

3261.599 --> 3264.7200000000003
right motivate them from a good

3263.28 --> 3265.52
perspective or even though it's gonna

3264.72 --> 3268.3999999999996
mess them up

3265.52 --> 3268.4
just fooling it

3268.559 --> 3272.4
but yeah then at the same time there

3270.24 --> 3274.72
might be also people in there that will

3272.4 --> 3279.839
definitely be like yeah there's no way

3274.72 --> 3279.839
because they do know the earth is flat

3281.2 --> 3285.1189999999997
but they're keeping it to themselves so

3286.079 --> 3290.319
even as an astronaut it's possible that

3288.96 --> 3293.599
they still believe

3290.319 --> 3295.839
it's possible they just never got to it

3293.599 --> 3297.6800000000003
because of technical reasons because the

3295.839 --> 3298.88
technology isn't that far despite what

3297.68 --> 3301.44
everybody thinks and there are

3298.88 --> 3303.76
unexpected obstacles

3301.44 --> 3304.88
it's this barrier to overcome might even

3303.76 --> 3309.28
be told it to

3304.88 --> 3309.28
to them like that so

3316.319 --> 3321.839
chris hadfield i don't know

3325.28 --> 3329.119
but why why does it matter why do you

3328.72 --> 3335.839
care

3329.119 --> 3335.839
why are you even thinking about it

3353.599 --> 3377.839
all right anyway

3362.72 --> 3377.839
be back two minutes

3416.839 --> 3419.839
so

3458.839 --> 3461.839
hmm

3486.16 --> 3489.839
okay mouth eyes if you say so

3490.319 --> 3494.64
i don't know man maybe elon musk is

3492.319 --> 3497.68
putting sad loons in our bed

3494.64 --> 3499.839
or maybe he's just using

3497.68 --> 3503.839
special type of drones or something i

3499.839 --> 3503.839
don't know what he's doing

3518.799 --> 3525.119
all right did i enjoy my birthday it is

3523.28 --> 3528.559
my birthday right now

3525.119 --> 3528.559
here we go again today

3529.76 --> 3537.119
the 6th of february

3533.119 --> 3537.119
is my birthday that's today

3537.599 --> 3541.2000000000003
am i enjoying it so far

3541.599 --> 3546.0
i haven't been awake for that long oh

3543.92 --> 3549.599
yeah also my landlord came by

3546.0 --> 3551.839
to and some potential new roommates

3549.599 --> 3554.799
that are gonna take the old room from

3551.839 --> 3557.2
the other one that's leaving

3554.799 --> 3558.0
they looked like pretty cool guys so

3557.2 --> 3560.319
yeah that would be

3558.0 --> 3560.319
cool

3561.359 --> 3565.5989999999997
didn't get to see their full faces

3563.119 --> 3569.119
though because they were masked up

3565.599 --> 3569.119
but yeah

3570.079 --> 3573.8390000000004
was still cool

3574.799 --> 3579.68
ah thank you mellow fellow much

3576.88 --> 3579.6800000000003
appreciate that

3582.319 --> 3587.52
any happier returns you thought it was

3585.28 --> 3590.2400000000002
yesterday no

3587.52 --> 3591.92
no yesterday i just wasn't feeling too

3590.24 --> 3593.4399999999996
great

3591.92 --> 3595.359
like i had a pretty rough night

3593.44 --> 3597.839
yesterday or uh not

3595.359 --> 3601.44
this night the night before from

3597.839 --> 3603.92
thursday to friday

3601.44 --> 3607.68
it's just plagued by freaking

3603.92 --> 3607.6800000000003
nightmarish things and all that

3608.24 --> 3616.72
i blame alex jones but yeah

3614.16 --> 3620.319
there was an interesting interview from

3616.72 --> 3620.319
with steve pachanik though

3621.119 --> 3625.119
that was right after now alex got me all

3624.16 --> 3627.2
riled up in

3625.119 --> 3628.319
anticipation of that and then he threw

3627.2 --> 3631.7599999999998
out like

3628.319 --> 3634.5589999999997
terrible vampiric

3631.76 --> 3635.5200000000004
[ __ ] descriptions that just don't want

3634.559 --> 3637.119
to know

3635.52 --> 3639.7599999999998
right before that and that kind of

3637.119 --> 3639.76
haunted me

3640.0 --> 3644.799
slightly and then well not really too

3643.359 --> 3647.2
much but then in the night

3644.799 --> 3648.64
like it started echoing back and kept me

3647.2 --> 3652.72
up

3648.64 --> 3654.24
made me feel uncomfortable so that's why

3652.72 --> 3656.16
yeah i didn't have a show yesterday

3654.24 --> 3659.2799999999997
because i got just up way

3656.16 --> 3663.52
too late like past one o'clock like past

3659.28 --> 3667.3590000000004
two i think it was almost two o'clock

3663.52 --> 3667.359
when i got up so i just thought nope

3669.2 --> 3673.4399999999996
it was mentioned in chat on patricia

3671.359 --> 3676.96
yeah but that was after 12 o'clock

3673.44 --> 3681.119
here we go again i even said that

3676.96 --> 3681.119
in that chat right when i said it

3681.599 --> 3688.7200000000003
because patricia went live like a 1

3685.119 --> 3691.92
30 amsterdam time

3688.72 --> 3698.5
after midnight so yeah then

3691.92 --> 3701.619
it was already the sixth

3698.5 --> 3701.619
[Music]

3706.85 --> 3710.4
[Music]

3711.839 --> 3716.4
if you're convinced any of my neighbor

3713.599 --> 3716.4
the earth is flat

3718.24 --> 3720.3999999999996
no

3722.48 --> 3728.88
but i think that most a lot of people do

3726.0 --> 3728.88
know i am

3729.599 --> 3735.3590000000004
i am like really alternative i am an

3732.88 --> 3741.119
outsider type of person

3735.359 --> 3743.359
and i never wear a mask

3741.119 --> 3746.1600000000003
like the only places where i wear a mask

3743.359 --> 3748.88
is when i absolutely have to

3746.16 --> 3749.2
and then i keep it very short i try not

3748.88 --> 3752.839
to

3749.2 --> 3754.319
never wear a mask longer than two

3752.839 --> 3757.2799999999997
minutes

3754.319 --> 3759.44
but yeah in my favorite organic

3757.28 --> 3760.799
supermarket i don't wear a mask and i'm

3759.44 --> 3763.68
very happy about

3760.799 --> 3765.68
just being left alone and even being

3763.68 --> 3767.2799999999997
appreciated for not wearing a mask so i

3765.68 --> 3769.0389999999998
can smile at people

3767.28 --> 3770.88
and then they can feel like oh yeah

3769.039 --> 3773.599
social contact again instead of just

3770.88 --> 3775.76
everybody freaking messed up

3773.599 --> 3778.7200000000003
right barely able to hear each other

3775.76 --> 3778.7200000000003
through their muffling

3779.359 --> 3784.48
huh birthday present for me what is it

3782.16 --> 3784.48
dank

3786.0 --> 3797.839

3811.359 --> 3818.5589999999997
oh i thought

3815.599 --> 3820.319
yeah yeah i i just checked paypal i i i

3818.559 --> 3820.7200000000003
was presuming you were talking about

3820.319 --> 3824.0
that

3820.72 --> 3825.52
indirectly thank you so much dank thank

3824.0 --> 3828.64

3825.52 --> 3829.52
birthday present that's awesome thank

3828.64 --> 3832.96
you very much

3829.52 --> 3835.7599999999998
very helpful because i'm still like

3832.96 --> 3836.64
on the edge of broke just kind of normal

3835.76 --> 3839.8390000000004
for this

3836.64 --> 3839.839
time of the month

3840.079 --> 3845.039
hopefully that'll change though in the

3842.96 --> 3847.76
not too distant future

3845.039 --> 3850.7200000000003
thank you so much for your support i

3847.76 --> 3852.6400000000003
really appreciate that

3850.72 --> 3855.68
because it does help my mood you know it

3852.64 --> 3859.44
like in it's been kind of like

3855.68 --> 3859.839
dried up a little it's not that bad

3859.44 --> 3862.559
though

3859.839 --> 3864.88
even you know compared to like a year

3862.559 --> 3866.799
ago

3864.88 --> 3868.1600000000003
but yeah it's not surprising you know

3866.799 --> 3870.88
it's like

3868.16 --> 3872.0789999999997
at some point when i get less donations

3870.88 --> 3875.44
and all that

3872.079 --> 3876.4
i go like yeah i don't blame you you

3875.44 --> 3878.7200000000003
know

3876.4 --> 3879.52
because yeah everybody's getting clammed

3878.72 --> 3881.7599999999998
down on

3879.52 --> 3883.52
and got to be more careful with how you

3881.76 --> 3885.76
spent your money because

3883.52 --> 3887.839
yeah the the channels are tightening

3885.76 --> 3890.1600000000003
down and all that

3887.839 --> 3892.4
and at the same time i have to get by as

3890.16 --> 3892.3999999999996
well

3893.76 --> 3897.92
and that's just very frust like and it

3895.92 --> 3900.079
piles up and i feel like i

3897.92 --> 3901.039
i i can't even complain to you guys

3900.079 --> 3902.7200000000003
about it

3901.039 --> 3905.76
because you are doing the best you can

3902.72 --> 3905.7599999999998
and i know you are

3906.0 --> 3911.2
and then yeah we all just get a little

3908.88 --> 3911.2000000000003
tense

3912.48 --> 3915.92
and with me yeah i got a little

3914.319 --> 3917.7599999999998
demoralized about it in

3915.92 --> 3921.44
in general because i knew like as soon

3917.76 --> 3921.44
as that [ __ ] started to happen

3921.76 --> 3927.3590000000004
with biden officially well

3925.119 --> 3929.76
supposedly taking the white house and do

3927.359 --> 3933.359
it yeah everything unrolling as it is

3929.76 --> 3935.2000000000003
that it was going to be a pressure on

3933.359 --> 3938.319
everybody

3935.2 --> 3938.319
i really felt that

3939.2 --> 3942.96
i also sent a smoke it oh thank you very

3941.599 --> 3944.48
much i'll check it out

3942.96 --> 3946.2400000000002
and by the way thank you moth ice for

3944.48 --> 3948.319
the two pound super generation get

3946.24 --> 3951.5989999999997
yourself some flat bread

3948.319 --> 3954.079
i got flat bread all right thank you

3951.599 --> 3954.079
very much

3954.24 --> 3959.52
oh by the way i also got in my patreon

3957.599 --> 3963.119
money

3959.52 --> 3964.079
a few days ago so thanks all my patreon

3963.119 --> 3967.359
supporters

3964.079 --> 3970.2400000000002
yeah i don't talk about them

3967.359 --> 3972.96
a lot but they have been with me for for

3970.24 --> 3972.9599999999996
a long time

3974.64 --> 3978.0
yeah thank you here we go again thank

3977.359 --> 3980.799
you very much

3978.0 --> 3980.799
for the donation

3983.76 --> 3992.7990000000004
uh but yeah my patreon supporters

3987.68 --> 3995.9199999999996
seeking star wars i think

3992.799 --> 3998.0
gaining wisdom brand am i

3995.92 --> 4000.559
i will never you're like my brand m is

3998.0 --> 4003.599
like my first patreon supporter

4000.559 --> 4007.8390000000004
if i remember correctly

4003.599 --> 4007.839
let's just go through that for a second

4025.52 --> 4032.319
yeah oh oh wait no seeking star order

4029.2 --> 4033.7599999999998
not you no samson it's samson gaining

4032.319 --> 4036.079
wisdom and brand

4033.76 --> 4038.2400000000002
brenda i think she can tell what i might

4036.079 --> 4040.4
have earlier but yeah samson is a

4038.24 --> 4042.0789999999997
patreon supporter like even twenty

4040.4 --> 4045.359
dollars a month

4042.079 --> 4046.88
man thank you so much all of that

4045.359 --> 4049.839
support

4046.88 --> 4049.839
is helping a lot

4053.92 --> 4059.119
guns robert guns robert

4060.839 --> 4067.2
what's yeah we got guns of nephron

4063.76 --> 4069.6800000000003
now robert he supported yeah

4067.2 --> 4071.1189999999997
he's been well one of my main supporters

4069.68 --> 4073.2799999999997
i could say like

4071.119 --> 4076.079
this is one of the bigger financiers

4073.28 --> 4078.48
kind of like dank

4076.079 --> 4080.1600000000003
yeah he has helped me regularly but i

4078.48 --> 4082.559
think he's in a bit of a tight spot

4080.16 --> 4085.2
right now he said that he would be

4082.559 --> 4086.0
helping me out like later next week

4085.2 --> 4089.5989999999997
somewhere

4086.0 --> 4091.28
so it's okay i'll survive but yeah he is

4089.599 --> 4092.6400000000003
a regular supporter and i really

4091.28 --> 4095.76
appreciate

4092.64 --> 4098.88
his support and also his input

4095.76 --> 4105.839
very spirited guy

4098.88 --> 4105.839
some good comments

4118.96 --> 4124.88
okay i love flat earth you don't really

4122.48 --> 4133.04
sound like you do

4124.88 --> 4147.839
sound a bit like a baller

4133.04 --> 4147.839
but that's fine

4154.0 --> 4161.839
imposter yeah yeah i get a lot of those

4166.56 --> 4171.6
yeah yeah we do see way too far

4173.279 --> 4180.2390000000005
we see we see too far for the

4177.04 --> 4182.48
geometry you shouldn't be able to see

4180.239 --> 4185.3589999999995
that forever

4182.48 --> 4186.879999999999
because of the spherical geometry yet we

4185.359 --> 4189.52
do

4186.88 --> 4190.0
and that's the black swan argument

4189.52 --> 4193.6
because

4190.0 --> 4194.239
you can't justify those low observation

4193.6 --> 4197.52
height

4194.239 --> 4199.44
super far distant sights you can't

4197.52 --> 4202.080000000001
justify that

4199.44 --> 4204.08
with the sphere geometry you can't it's

4202.08 --> 4206.0
impossible

4204.08 --> 4208.88
like there's this fictional science

4206.0 --> 4210.159
fictional explanation about terrestrial

4208.88 --> 4213.36
refraction

4210.159 --> 4215.36
but that's not based in actual optics

4213.36 --> 4217.759999999999
though it's never been demonstrated that

4215.36 --> 4221.36
that's actually a thing

4217.76 --> 4223.76
also it contradicts the things that have

4221.36 --> 4226.239
been established within optics

4223.76 --> 4227.76
about for example miraging type

4226.239 --> 4230.239
displacements

4227.76 --> 4231.1990000000005
which always happen in relation to the

4230.239 --> 4234.159
horizon

4231.199 --> 4236.5599999999995
the horizon itself that apparent

4234.159 --> 4239.12
position where the sky meets the ground

4236.56 --> 4240.0
right that apparent location will be

4239.12 --> 4243.36
determined

4240.0 --> 4246.4
it will also be dependent on

4243.36 --> 4248.159
yeah how far you can see how blurred up

4246.4 --> 4250.719
the sky is

4248.159 --> 4252.32
how much moist is in the air for example

4250.719 --> 4255.679
while the horizon

4252.32 --> 4256.4
that visual place where the sky appears

4255.679 --> 4260.32
to meet

4256.4 --> 4265.839999999999
the ground cannot be displaced

4260.32 --> 4269.84
in any way because of miraging effects

4265.84 --> 4273.1990000000005
very specific yeah that fundamentally

4269.84 --> 4275.4400000000005
undoes the very notion of terrestrial

4273.199 --> 4276.879999999999
refraction

4275.44 --> 4279.12
and then on top of that of course

4276.88 --> 4282.159000000001
terrestrial refraction being used as a

4279.12 --> 4284.96
last ditch resort to prove the radius

4282.159 --> 4288.08
actually assumes mathematically the

4284.96 --> 4290.64
radius within the very formula

4288.08 --> 4292.88
right so that makes it a paradox on a

4290.64 --> 4295.04
mathematical basis

4292.88 --> 4296.88
as well so there is no real

4295.04 --> 4300.0
justification

4296.88 --> 4303.52
for these low observation height

4300.0 --> 4305.76
very distant sights on a sphere

4303.52 --> 4306.64
it's physically impossible and nothing

4305.76 --> 4310.0
could make

4306.64 --> 4312.64
it possible if the earth were sphere

4310.0 --> 4314.0
yet we do see them therefore we can only

4312.64 --> 4317.12
conclude the earth cannot

4314.0 --> 4320.4
be a sphere of the

4317.12 --> 4323.76
yeah of the mentioned dimensions

4320.4 --> 4329.839999999999
it's geometrically mathematically

4323.76 --> 4329.84
and optically impossible

4331.19 --> 4334.32
[Music]

4346.0 --> 4349.13
[Music]

4350.4 --> 4357.839999999999
keyword impossible yeah yeah

4368.2 --> 4371.33
[Music]

4380.6 --> 4383.659000000001
[Music]

4386.92 --> 4390.069
[Music]

4393.199 --> 4399.04
rarely at the distance what

4397.04 --> 4400.08
what are you saying mellow fellow i have

4399.04 --> 4402.96
no idea where you're

4400.08 --> 4402.96
getting that from

4410.719 --> 4414.8
who said that oh wait i love letters

4413.52 --> 4418.159000000001
that

4414.8 --> 4421.52
the observed horizon is rarely

4418.159 --> 4426.5599999999995
at the distance of the geomet

4421.52 --> 4429.4400000000005
yeah but the thing is that's very funny

4426.56 --> 4429.4400000000005
because it might

4433.199 --> 4435.44
like

4438.719 --> 4447.76
it can't be anywhere else it has to be

4443.92 --> 4450.08
at the geometry it the horizon has to be

4447.76 --> 4454.56
the geometric horizon if the earth was

4450.08 --> 4457.76
geometrically a ball

4454.56 --> 4459.120000000001
so how can the horizon ever not be

4457.76 --> 4461.12
at the place where it has to be

4459.12 --> 4465.599999999999
according to the geometry

4461.12 --> 4465.599999999999
unless that geometry is not real

4467.04 --> 4483.84
yeah yeah mellow fellow sorry i was a

4468.64 --> 4483.84
little late catching up on that

4507.28 --> 4510.4
oh by the way for those that don't know

4509.12 --> 4515.36
yet

4510.4 --> 4518.08
i got a i started up a discord server

4515.36 --> 4518.08
of my own

4522.96 --> 4530.4
and i hope to to maybe at some point

4526.4 --> 4530.4
get some people in the panel there

4532.32 --> 4535.679
and yeah get on the show

4536.48 --> 4539.599999999999
or i don't know maybe if you typically

4538.64 --> 4542.96
like discord

4539.6 --> 4542.96
you can hang around in there

4544.239 --> 4550.799999999999
you know if you don't want like a

4547.76 --> 4552.0
24 7 discord happening or you don't want

4550.8 --> 4555.04
to sit in between

4552.0 --> 4555.679
ballers while the flat earth debate is

4555.04 --> 4558.32
not live

4555.679 --> 4559.04
on the debate the flat earth debate

4558.32 --> 4562.32
science

4559.04 --> 4563.679
versus pseudoscience server compati

4562.32 --> 4566.88
server

4563.679 --> 4572.0
so yeah that's why i made it i

4566.88 --> 4572.0
meant to do a server a very long time

4573.84 --> 4576.64
and now i did it

4577.199 --> 4580.96
and it yeah didn't even turn out to be

4578.88 --> 4586.0
that hard but it there will be more

4580.96 --> 4586.0
work concerning it

4587.76 --> 4592.2390000000005
but yeah if you're interested in my

4589.52 --> 4596.64
discord server then

4592.239 --> 4600.879999999999
get over there i'll send

4596.64 --> 4603.1990000000005
a link to that server in the chat

4600.88 --> 4604.32
come and visit sometime maybe hang

4603.199 --> 4606.32
around

4604.32 --> 4607.599999999999
and i don't know once things get going i

4606.32 --> 4611.199
might actually

4607.6 --> 4613.92
use it yeah as a kind of a panel

4611.199 --> 4613.919999999999
situation

4614.4 --> 4619.599999999999
so yeah get in my discord server become

4617.36 --> 4621.679
a part of that

4619.6 --> 4623.76
and eventually i'm also going to kind of

4621.679 --> 4624.96
need moderators and stuff and that might

4623.76 --> 4628.96
become this whole

4624.96 --> 4632.56
hassle and all that probably

4628.96 --> 4635.4
but i have no choice if i want a surfer

4632.56 --> 4638.400000000001
that is completely

4635.4 --> 4638.4
uncompromised

4638.56 --> 4643.120000000001
has no influence compromise

4641.239 --> 4646.239
compromisations and all that

4643.12 --> 4649.28
which is going on out there

4646.239 --> 4652.48
then i have to do it myself so

4649.28 --> 4652.48
i'm doing it myself

4652.56 --> 4665.84
and who knows where it'll go

4668.88 --> 4675.04
no i don't have skates i don't have ice

4672.0 --> 4675.04
skates for in each

4678.88 --> 4683.92
i don't think i love flat earth really

4681.92 --> 4685.6
loves flat earth i think he's a baller

4683.92 --> 4688.88
that's just

4685.6 --> 4690.8
trying to tag himself with some virtual

4688.88 --> 4691.1990000000005
signal name in the hopes that he won't

4690.8 --> 4694.88
get

4691.199 --> 4698.08
banned as he starts to gradually

4694.88 --> 4702.0
annoy and verbally

4698.08 --> 4702.0
piss off people in my chat

4703.04 --> 4707.84
hey agm

4720.0 --> 4722.32
what

4723.12 --> 4727.04
geometric horizons are pretty irrelevant

4726.719 --> 4730.64
to

4727.04 --> 4734.56
observation no

4730.64 --> 4734.96
no they're not what kind of remark is

4734.56 --> 4738.080000000001
that

4734.96 --> 4738.96
what the hell no the geometry means

4738.08 --> 4740.64
everything

4738.96 --> 4742.96
if you think the earth is a ball then

4740.64 --> 4745.6
that geometry is going to be

4742.96 --> 4747.84
involved in every sighting because

4745.6 --> 4750.56
you're standing on it

4747.84 --> 4751.92
get it if you really think you're

4750.56 --> 4754.96
standing on the ball well it's gonna

4751.92 --> 4758.4800000000005
have some geometrical consequences

4754.96 --> 4760.56
it's not rarely involved in sights

4758.48 --> 4763.04
no there's a certain geometry that's

4760.56 --> 4764.8
going to obstruct things you see into

4763.04 --> 4766.8
the distance it's always going to be

4764.8 --> 4777.84
relevant

4766.8 --> 4777.84
always if the earth was actually a ball

4782.48 --> 4787.04
oh oh you mean terrestro refraction i

4786.0 --> 4789.84
love flat earth

4787.04 --> 4790.96
you mean that the terrestrial fraction i

4789.84 --> 4794.159000000001
literally just

4790.96 --> 4795.76
does this guy have me on mute

4794.159 --> 4797.839999999999
because he's if he's not going to

4795.76 --> 4800.400000000001
actually respond to me as i address him

4797.84 --> 4803.4400000000005
then i'm just going to kick him

4800.4 --> 4807.28
yeah if you're in my chat and you don't

4803.44 --> 4811.28
listen to the host i am going to

4807.28 --> 4814.239
kick you as a disruptive troll

4811.28 --> 4814.88
do you hear me i love flat earth you

4814.239 --> 4819.839999999999
hear me

4814.88 --> 4819.84
are you going to respond to me right now

4820.159 --> 4827.12
i give you five seconds to respond to me

4823.199 --> 4831.199
i love flat earth five

4827.12 --> 4833.84
four three two

4831.199 --> 4833.839999999999
one

4842.32 --> 4848.0
maybe a slow typer ah i thought so yeah

4845.84 --> 4861.84
get the [ __ ] out

4848.0 --> 4861.84
piece of [ __ ] troll

4863.93 --> 4867.009
[Music]

4867.04 --> 4872.8
somebody tell him if you're in my chat

4870.56 --> 4874.159000000001
you're going to listen to the show host

4872.8 --> 4875.6
if you don't respond when he's

4874.159 --> 4878.799999999999
addressing you in chat

4875.6 --> 4878.8
you will be banned

4880.239 --> 4885.5199999999995
i might actually update the rules

4883.52 --> 4887.360000000001
that may be a good one the live chat

4885.52 --> 4890.2390000000005
rules yeah

4887.36 --> 4891.679
i should say that the host addresses you

4890.239 --> 4895.04
and you don't respond

4891.679 --> 4896.56
after a couple of times i just kick you

4895.04 --> 4898.719
because that means you're probably on

4896.56 --> 4901.84
mute you muted me

4898.719 --> 4903.679
and you're just nagging at my chat

4901.84 --> 4906.08
that's not acceptable

4903.679 --> 4907.679
if you're gonna watch my show you're

4906.08 --> 4908.639
gonna be part of the chat then you're

4907.679 --> 4912.8
going to have to

4908.639 --> 4914.84
indulge my whiny voice if you think it's

4912.8 --> 4917.84
whiny or maybe you think it's kind of

4914.84 --> 4917.84
soothing

4918.4 --> 4924.08
exotic slightly dutch accent

4921.92 --> 4926.56
whatever right you're gonna have to

4924.08 --> 4929.679
indulge that

4926.56 --> 4931.92
because if you don't i'm gonna kick you

4929.679 --> 4933.6
you're not gonna be in my chat and not

4931.92 --> 4935.52
listen to my show

4933.6 --> 4945.84
and what i have to say especially when i

4935.52 --> 4945.84
start addressing you

4946.4 --> 4952.159
yeah agm but like for

4950.239 --> 4955.199
for americans well everything other than

4952.159 --> 4959.159
the usa is exotic so

4955.199 --> 4962.96
in that sense it's a weird european

4959.159 --> 4973.839999999999
amsterdam dutch folk

4962.96 --> 4973.84
with their strange language

4976.8 --> 4980.88
yeah i try to do my best to get my

4978.719 --> 4983.44
accent out as much as i can

4980.88 --> 4985.52
because i don't appre i hate people with

4983.44 --> 4986.08
a dutch accent that speak english with

4985.52 --> 4988.159000000001
like this

4986.08 --> 4990.8
really audible dutch accent i can't

4988.159 --> 4990.799999999999
stand it

4995.44 --> 5001.839999999999
hey steamy traveler good to see you

5008.56 --> 5013.280000000001
yeah sorry for cutting that guy short i

5011.28 --> 5015.44
know you guys were engaging in debating

5013.28 --> 5018.88
him but

5015.44 --> 5022.0
yeah it's not gonna work like

5018.88 --> 5024.159000000001
i don't mind ballers getting in my chat

5022.0 --> 5025.12
doing that and all that right i don't

5024.159 --> 5027.839999999999
mind it

5025.12 --> 5029.44
i yeah i've been open about that like

5027.84 --> 5032.4800000000005
you can do that

5029.44 --> 5037.759999999999
but you can't do it and then

5032.48 --> 5037.759999999999
ignore me that's something i don't allow

5038.56 --> 5045.4400000000005
right this chat is not a free for all

5042.0 --> 5046.88
chat you can do whatever you like

5045.44 --> 5049.44
now if you're going to be there you're

5046.88 --> 5052.159000000001
going to have to have certain types of

5049.44 --> 5052.96
responses because i interact with my

5052.159 --> 5056.5599999999995
chat

5052.96 --> 5060.32
there's rules

5056.56 --> 5060.719
right but yeah the guy was hilarious

5060.32 --> 5063.84
though

5060.719 --> 5066.719
suggesting that now you rarely see the

5063.84 --> 5069.360000000001
geometric right

5066.719 --> 5071.28
because of refraction which you

5069.36 --> 5071.599999999999
obviously didn't understand what it is

5071.28 --> 5076.0
and

5071.6 --> 5079.52
probably mixed up actual refraction with

5076.0 --> 5083.6
terrestrial refraction which is a

5079.52 --> 5087.92
paradox based on optics

5083.6 --> 5087.92
that can't happen never happen like that

5088.719 --> 5092.4800000000005
but it is still funny when they say it

5096.84 --> 5102.84
though

5099.719 --> 5107.04
liverpool pudlian

5102.84 --> 5107.04
liverpodlian what

5108.56 --> 5112.4800000000005
you mean liverpoolian what does it

5111.84 --> 5127.84
really

5112.48 --> 5127.839999999999
pronounce pudlian what

5130.239 --> 5135.678999999999
you sound like a villain it's mothers

5133.44 --> 5135.678999999999
what

5138.84 --> 5141.84
really

5158.4 --> 5163.199
right so it it's a liver pool but if

5161.84 --> 5165.58
you're from there

5163.199 --> 5167.759999999999
then it's a liver puddle

5165.58 --> 5182.159
[Music]

5167.76 --> 5184.8
that's kind of funny

5182.159 --> 5185.679
pool is a puddle well a puddle is kind

5184.8 --> 5189.679
of a small

5185.679 --> 5194.84
pool right or maybe that's just

5189.679 --> 5197.84
how i think about it is it perfectly

5194.84 --> 5197.84
synonymous

5208.88 --> 5213.4400000000005
besides dutch in english what language

5211.04 --> 5217.6
are you proficient in none

5213.44 --> 5220.879999999999
i'm not really not really proficient in

5217.6 --> 5220.88
other languages but i

5220.96 --> 5227.12
can make out a little with certain

5224.639 --> 5229.76
languages like with german

5227.12 --> 5229.76
spanish

5230.88 --> 5237.36
i get it a little and

5234.159 --> 5239.199
i have become kind of decent in even

5237.36 --> 5242.5599999999995
trying to triangulate

5239.199 --> 5244.4
roughly where somebody would be from

5242.56 --> 5247.280000000001
based on the the way they talk and the

5244.4 --> 5250.4
way they sound their accent

5247.28 --> 5251.599999999999
so i am kind of like i got a feel for it

5250.4 --> 5254.4
but i don't

5251.6 --> 5256.159000000001
i don't know the actual language in

5254.4 --> 5259.679
itself

5256.159 --> 5267.839999999999
but i recognize tones and

5259.679 --> 5267.84
and all that

5270.239 --> 5273.839999999999
so yeah that's pretty much the order of

5271.84 --> 5277.679
it

5273.84 --> 5280.639
like i'm almost proficient in spanish

5277.679 --> 5282.159
and german you could say almost but not

5280.639 --> 5285.28
really

5282.159 --> 5287.679
and the rest is just rough guessing

5285.28 --> 5288.8
but i i won't be able to really make out

5287.679 --> 5295.84
what you're saying

5288.8 --> 5295.84
in other languages

5315.52 --> 5323.84
what what is that

5324.639 --> 5327.92
what check out latest video you mention

5327.28 --> 5337.84
me what

5327.92 --> 5337.84
pseudo-reality you have a channel

5348.84 --> 5353.4400000000005
hmm

5351.199 --> 5353.44
uh

5354.239 --> 5358.239
all right oh

5358.639 --> 5367.679
strictly for flat earth markers

5362.0 --> 5367.679
is that the video you mention me really

5368.4 --> 5374.879999999999
huh okay i don't know

5371.92 --> 5379.84
what it's going to be about though but

5374.88 --> 5379.84
i'll link that video i guess

5389.76 --> 5394.08
have ever considered becoming an english

5392.48 --> 5396.638999999999
language instructor over in the

5394.08 --> 5396.639
netherlands

5397.52 --> 5402.159000000001
i'd be willing to help people to a

5399.679 --> 5406.32
certain degree

5402.159 --> 5409.679
but professionally

5406.32 --> 5412.0
i have considered it it's just that

5409.679 --> 5414.88
right now i have a lot of trouble

5412.0 --> 5418.159
interfacing with a lot of people

5414.88 --> 5418.88
because if i was gonna teach people

5418.159 --> 5420.96
things

5418.88 --> 5423.28
like a language i would have to do it on

5420.96 --> 5427.04
my own terms

5423.28 --> 5428.5599999999995
because otherwise it i just not really

5427.04 --> 5430.719
hand them

5428.56 --> 5432.84
the right things i just follow some

5430.719 --> 5435.84
program

5432.84 --> 5435.84
right

5437.04 --> 5451.679
hey nathan oakley good to see you

5449.199 --> 5452.5599999999995
all right but technically anybody who

5451.679 --> 5455.679
would be

5452.56 --> 5457.360000000001
my friend in the netherlands

5455.679 --> 5459.12
that i could kind of build on say for

5457.36 --> 5461.679
example guys like roger

5459.12 --> 5463.5199999999995
now roger is pretty pretty decent in

5461.679 --> 5465.52
english he's pretty good at it

5463.52 --> 5468.0
if he would ever had trouble finding a

5465.52 --> 5471.4400000000005
word i would immediately help him out

5468.0 --> 5473.44
hey sometimes i even help english people

5471.44 --> 5474.239
out finding the right words how about

5473.44 --> 5477.759999999999
that

5474.239 --> 5480.5599999999995
right now that's a real kick

5477.76 --> 5482.56
to me i don't mean to humiliate anybody

5480.56 --> 5485.92
but it's a real kick to me

5482.56 --> 5486.56
when that happens and hey sometimes i'm

5485.92 --> 5489.1990000000005
complete

5486.56 --> 5490.159000000001
at a loss for word so it goes with ups

5489.199 --> 5491.919999999999
and downs some

5490.159 --> 5493.599999999999
sometimes i know how to pick out all

5491.92 --> 5497.36
kinds of words and the other times

5493.6 --> 5500.4800000000005
i have trouble finding even regular

5497.36 --> 5500.48
words i don't know why

5501.52 --> 5505.84
it happens

5513.04 --> 5518.4
no lucas holmes it's about calling

5516.84 --> 5521.76
yourself

5518.4 --> 5523.36
i love flat earth then arguing for the

5521.76 --> 5526.88
globe

5523.36 --> 5529.04
and not listening to the show host

5526.88 --> 5530.400000000001
that's the issue it's not about an echo

5529.04 --> 5533.6
chamber it's about

5530.4 --> 5536.5599999999995
just having a little respect and not

5533.6 --> 5537.679
trying to be manipulative no if you're

5536.56 --> 5540.400000000001
just a baller

5537.679 --> 5542.4
you can be a baller in my chat i have

5540.4 --> 5545.679
ballers in my chat

5542.4 --> 5547.28
tiny womble for example i hope he's not

5545.679 --> 5548.88
he's gonna reconsider taking that

5547.28 --> 5552.0
freaking vaccine

5548.88 --> 5552.0
in may as he said

5552.4 --> 5558.879999999999
don't do it but i have ballers in my

5556.56 --> 5558.88
chat

5559.199 --> 5562.96
and they can be respectful they

5560.88 --> 5566.88
understand how to do things

5562.96 --> 5570.4800000000005
here and they also

5566.88 --> 5574.88
reap the benefits from the better

5570.48 --> 5578.638999999999
atmosphere from that respect

5574.88 --> 5578.96
from one to another roger is a baller

5578.639 --> 5589.84
too

5578.96 --> 5589.84
what no no he's not

5589.92 --> 5595.1990000000005
no i'm pretty damn sure he's not like

5592.48 --> 5595.199
we've talked

5595.6 --> 5602.96
ah it's a joke thanks thanks it's not

5598.32 --> 5606.159
confusing at all

5602.96 --> 5609.04
don't please don't just do straight out

5606.159 --> 5609.04
fake outs it's

5614.84 --> 5619.679
right

5617.12 --> 5620.48
baller means person who understands

5619.679 --> 5623.92
reality

5620.48 --> 5627.36
what what

5623.92 --> 5627.36
no no it doesn't

5628.56 --> 5635.120000000001
baller means somebody who believes

5631.679 --> 5638.2390000000005
in models right

5635.12 --> 5640.0
over empirical physical evidence in the

5638.239 --> 5643.36
real world

5640.0 --> 5646.96
who's very willing to overlook natural

5643.36 --> 5650.5599999999995
consequences within geometry

5646.96 --> 5652.32
within science within all kinds of

5650.56 --> 5655.84
things to make

5652.32 --> 5658.4
these virtual ball mechanics work

5655.84 --> 5661.28
even with pieces that are missing so the

5658.4 --> 5664.638999999999
model is now functioning at this moment

5661.28 --> 5667.36
utilizing gravity even though nobody

5664.639 --> 5668.56
actually has any evidence for gravity or

5667.36 --> 5672.4
really can

5668.56 --> 5672.8
define what it is they can only describe

5672.4 --> 5675.759999999999
it

5672.8 --> 5677.76
or give a metaphorical description of

5675.76 --> 5679.52
what it's supposed to do nobody actually

5677.76 --> 5681.4400000000005
knows what it does in physics

5679.52 --> 5683.360000000001
it doesn't do anything in physics

5681.44 --> 5686.96
actually because there's no

5683.36 --> 5689.5199999999995
proof what it is right but get the

5686.96 --> 5691.44
entire ball models resting on it

5689.52 --> 5692.719
right so that's also a part of it it's

5691.44 --> 5695.839999999999
just very

5692.719 --> 5699.04
easy laid back of going around

5695.84 --> 5702.159000000001
with facts and data and just be very

5699.04 --> 5705.92
creative put it all together into this

5702.159 --> 5708.879999999999
paper mache ball earth

5705.92 --> 5710.56
in a presumed endless outer space vacuum

5708.88 --> 5712.4800000000005
with a bunch of other balls

5710.56 --> 5714.159000000001
spinning around it or it's spinning

5712.48 --> 5716.4
underneath it

5714.159 --> 5716.4
right

5718.0 --> 5721.679
but it's a mess the entire setup is a

5720.96 --> 5725.52
giant

5721.679 --> 5729.1990000000005
giant mess with big calculatory

5725.52 --> 5731.280000000001
gaps confessed confessedly so

5729.199 --> 5733.44
right remember rump is coming on the

5731.28 --> 5734.96
flat earth debate saying how the orbit

5733.44 --> 5738.5599999999995
of mercury

5734.96 --> 5741.04
cannot be explained cannot be

5738.56 --> 5742.0
calculated through the newtonian

5741.04 --> 5744.8
mechanics even though

5742.0 --> 5746.48
the other parts of the of the solar

5744.8 --> 5750.159000000001
system could

5746.48 --> 5752.239
right so yeah just you can calculate it

5750.159 --> 5754.0
so what then apply a completely

5752.239 --> 5756.638999999999
different math

5754.0 --> 5758.0
that takes place in not in the physical

5756.639 --> 5761.28
reality

5758.0 --> 5764.08
to then given like oh but this

5761.28 --> 5766.159
can fix it even though that that form of

5764.08 --> 5768.639
geometry has nothing to do with physical

5766.159 --> 5772.5599999999995
reality cannot be proven to be real

5768.639 --> 5776.08
right that sort of thing just very

5772.56 --> 5778.88
willingness to be flexible with reality

5776.08 --> 5785.84
in order to prove

5778.88 --> 5785.84
your spinning ball in outer space

5796.84 --> 5799.84
uh

5805.679 --> 5812.119
spherical oh a sphere it's all spheres

5808.88 --> 5814.159000000001
around another sphere right it doesn't

5812.119 --> 5816.48
super far distance

5814.159 --> 5817.5199999999995
and unaffected by the infrasquare law of

5816.48 --> 5820.799999999999
light

5817.52 --> 5822.400000000001
right exponential monk huh huh

5820.8 --> 5823.92
oh you didn't think about that oh it

5822.4 --> 5826.879999999999
doesn't really work out or you got some

5823.92 --> 5831.119
stupid justification

5826.88 --> 5833.92
okay oh nathan made a comment

5831.119 --> 5835.839999999999
on the video i linked okay i haven't

5833.92 --> 5837.6
watched the video myself yet i just put

5835.84 --> 5841.84
it out there

5837.6 --> 5841.84
for people to check out

5854.48 --> 5869.839999999999
oh god oh pseudo reality you a baller

5871.92 --> 5874.159
what

5879.52 --> 5884.96
like trouble making out what this what's

5882.56 --> 5884.96
happening

5885.44 --> 5891.599999999999
yeah which video the video strictly for

5888.08 --> 5894.4
flat earth mockers from pseudo reality

5891.6 --> 5895.6
nathan commented in there apparently a

5894.4 --> 5898.08
couple of times

5895.6 --> 5898.08
i see

5902.8 --> 5906.8
i haven't watched the video i don't know

5904.159 --> 5909.04
what it was about i was assuming

5906.8 --> 5911.4400000000005
it was something positive i don't know

5909.04 --> 5913.679
if it is i don't know pseudo reality too

5911.44 --> 5915.919999999999
well

5913.679 --> 5918.32
can you read my comments yes sure i will

5915.92 --> 5918.32
nathan

5922.719 --> 5928.88
all right yeah what you said

5926.8 --> 5931.4400000000005
three minutes ago did the horizon become

5928.88 --> 5933.119
a physical geometric sphere edge again

5931.44 --> 5936.0
when i wasn't looking

5933.119 --> 5938.08
meanwhile you no longer have a physical

5936.0 --> 5940.0
geometric sphere edge for horizon as

5938.08 --> 5941.04
required by a geometric globe earth

5940.0 --> 5944.159
model

5941.04 --> 5944.159
whispers black swan

5944.4 --> 5948.638999999999
and the other comment was did you make

5946.32 --> 5952.0
the horizon sphere edge to block stuff

5948.639 --> 5955.52
like in the maths you idiots used

5952.0 --> 5955.52
prior to blacks one

5956.96 --> 5960.639
you're commenting on all of it aren't

5958.639 --> 5964.08
you

5960.639 --> 5968.719
more blacks one yeah i think

5964.08 --> 5968.719
the main message is black swan isn't it

5978.84 --> 5981.84
nathan

5994.4 --> 5999.92
hmm attended to

5998.0 --> 6001.92
once i got 100 members the show is

5999.92 --> 6009.84
public so you can join if you want

6001.92 --> 6009.84
to say something chatters members only

6013.84 --> 6019.1990000000005
huh okay cool yeah nathan by the way i

6017.28 --> 6021.36
don't know if you've noticed but i have

6019.199 --> 6022.0
a discord server now and i want to make

6021.36 --> 6024.32
it available

6022.0 --> 6025.44
for you too i will give you moderator

6024.32 --> 6029.119
status there

6025.44 --> 6031.678999999999
if you like unless like all the ballers

6029.119 --> 6036.719
will all start to cry out and like

6031.679 --> 6039.04
be oh my god it's

6036.719 --> 6040.56
it's it's the new holocaust if nathan

6039.04 --> 6042.719
gets a wrench in my

6040.56 --> 6044.4800000000005
yeah then it's like oh my god it's so

6042.719 --> 6045.84
bad i don't know they might start

6044.48 --> 6049.5199999999995
whining like that i don't know

6045.84 --> 6051.84
i really don't care in the end i'm all

6049.52 --> 6051.84
okay

6052.0 --> 6055.6
with those things that you imagine that

6054.8 --> 6058.8
it means

6055.6 --> 6058.8
i'm all okay with that

6061.04 --> 6066.8
i'm all okay with complaining pants

6063.6 --> 6068.88
making up stupid dramatic [ __ ]

6066.8 --> 6070.400000000001
with that stupid dramatic [ __ ] happening

6068.88 --> 6073.84
to them just as they

6070.4 --> 6077.679
conjured it up i'm all okay with that

6073.84 --> 6081.360000000001
right anyway i'll link the

6077.679 --> 6085.6
discord server

6081.36 --> 6085.599999999999
to the chat again for you nathan

6086.48 --> 6090.0
i don't know how active it's going to be

6088.159 --> 6091.28
so it's basically a hang around space

6090.0 --> 6094.719
but if you want to

6091.28 --> 6094.719
use it to hang around

6095.6 --> 6101.119000000001
yes it is really my birthday today

6097.44 --> 6101.119
steamy traveler yes it is

6102.8 --> 6107.84
the door keeps opening looks like

6109.119 --> 6121.839999999999
it's kind of cold outside anyway i'll be

6111.6 --> 6121.84
back in two minutes again

6211.28 --> 6216.32
yeah thanks steamy traveler thanks for

6213.36 --> 6216.32
the happy birthday

6217.199 --> 6221.36
i don't feel a year older

6226.32 --> 6228.719
what

6230.32 --> 6234.719
the [ __ ] is that about dank

6242.8 --> 6261.84
it's a lot to think about

6247.44 --> 6261.839999999999
really is it

6264.96 --> 6270.2390000000005
no ethically speaking no and that name

6268.4 --> 6271.5199999999995
is [ __ ] i'm gonna ban you again

6270.239 --> 6274.638999999999
anyway

6271.52 --> 6277.84
but i think

6274.639 --> 6279.4400000000005
i think it's like the same guy i i don't

6277.84 --> 6280.56
know maybe i'm not going to ban you i

6279.44 --> 6283.678999999999
don't care but it's just like

6280.56 --> 6287.04
really dumb to say it's really

6283.679 --> 6291.1990000000005
really dumb to say that

6287.04 --> 6291.199
it's unbelievably stupid

6291.84 --> 6298.2390000000005
this this and then actually starts

6295.199 --> 6298.239
harping on about it

6300.84 --> 6303.84
afterwards

6303.92 --> 6309.1990000000005
this is so dumb why

6307.04 --> 6311.36
why is it stupid can somebody tell

6309.199 --> 6312.32
ethically speaking why it is so

6311.36 --> 6316.159
unbelievably

6312.32 --> 6319.759999999999
stupid to say that

6316.159 --> 6323.28
is up with why cognitive dissonance

6319.76 --> 6327.04
right why would we

6323.28 --> 6331.84
accept evidence for something that is

6327.04 --> 6334.719
physically demonstratively impossible

6331.84 --> 6336.2390000000005
outer space cannot be a vacuum it cannot

6334.719 --> 6339.52
be

6336.239 --> 6342.5599999999995
right so how could you

6339.52 --> 6345.92
go there and take that picture and then

6342.56 --> 6349.280000000001
it would be actually as it looks

6345.92 --> 6352.2390000000005
it's impossible right

6349.28 --> 6352.639
but pick yourself a black swan yeah yeah

6352.239 --> 6355.36
yeah

6352.639 --> 6355.84
that is possible you know why because

6355.36 --> 6359.679
it's

6355.84 --> 6362.96
on earth and anybody can do it

6359.679 --> 6363.679
there's nothing about it that requires

6362.96 --> 6366.4
it to be

6363.679 --> 6367.52
dismissed entirely because it's a

6366.4 --> 6370.638999999999
potentially

6367.52 --> 6372.360000000001
normal out there in the real physical

6370.639 --> 6376.0
and natural world

6372.36 --> 6379.36
situation yeah has nothing to do with

6376.0 --> 6379.36
cognitive dissonance

6379.6 --> 6382.8
but yeah of course you didn't understand

6381.44 --> 6385.04
that because you're

6382.8 --> 6386.4800000000005
you're a religious zealot and you

6385.04 --> 6389.6
specialize

6386.48 --> 6390.638999999999
in strategically misunderstanding

6389.6 --> 6396.0
arguments

6390.639 --> 6396.0
i know you are i know that's what you do

6396.88 --> 6403.679
and yeah when you when you grow old

6401.28 --> 6404.88
those ballers when they grow old if they

6403.679 --> 6407.52
grow old

6404.88 --> 6409.04
they are going to be psychologically so

6407.52 --> 6411.6
messed up

6409.04 --> 6412.84
you thought that some grand people

6411.6 --> 6415.84
grandpa

6412.84 --> 6418.96
grandma could be kind of nutty

6415.84 --> 6421.8
these people are freaking insane

6418.96 --> 6423.36
the way they are strategically

6421.8 --> 6426.400000000001
misunderstanding things

6423.36 --> 6431.159
yeah strategic misunderstanding

6426.4 --> 6443.36
just just listen to the word strategic

6431.159 --> 6445.199
misunderstanding yeah

6443.36 --> 6447.5199999999995
we're becoming psychologically more

6445.199 --> 6450.239
messed up no no that's projection

6447.52 --> 6450.639
that's absolute projection because i

6450.239 --> 6454.0
just

6450.639 --> 6455.1990000000005
addressed your stupid stupid little

6454.0 --> 6457.679
claim

6455.199 --> 6459.5199999999995
after reposting it after you whining

6457.679 --> 6462.159
about me addressing it because you

6459.52 --> 6463.400000000001
actually believed it you know why

6462.159 --> 6466.48
because you had a

6463.4 --> 6468.48
strategical misunderstanding about it

6466.48 --> 6471.119
because that's what you submit you have

6468.48 --> 6474.5599999999995
to do that to survive

6471.119 --> 6476.96
the absolute [ __ ] nonsense

6474.56 --> 6480.56
that you make yourself believe you have

6476.96 --> 6483.04
to misunderstand it strategically i know

6480.56 --> 6484.56
i know you survive on strategical

6483.04 --> 6487.04
misunderstanding

6484.56 --> 6487.04
i know

6488.48 --> 6499.839999999999
and now i've attacked title for the show

6506.22 --> 6509.279
[Music]

6517.11 --> 6520.7
[Music]

6538.88 --> 6544.4800000000005
i keep squirting buddy you're lost

6542.0 --> 6546.0
you've lost you have no arguments you

6544.48 --> 6547.839999999999
don't understand the black swan you

6546.0 --> 6549.28
don't even understand the very argument

6547.84 --> 6550.639
you don't understand the natural

6549.28 --> 6552.719
consequences of

6550.639 --> 6554.0
geometry so you don't understand

6552.719 --> 6557.199
geometry you don't

6554.0 --> 6559.52
understand optics because you imagine

6557.199 --> 6561.199
that things can be visible even though

6559.52 --> 6563.92
they're physically

6561.199 --> 6566.48
behind something right that's what

6563.92 --> 6569.1990000000005
terrestrial refraction suggests

6566.48 --> 6570.32
right so yeah strategical

6569.199 --> 6572.5599999999995
misunderstanding

6570.32 --> 6575.199
all over the place you misunderstand

6572.56 --> 6578.159000000001
optics you misunderstand geometry

6575.199 --> 6580.0
you misunderstand argumentation you

6578.159 --> 6583.04
misunderstand science

6580.0 --> 6584.599
it's all a giant collection of

6583.04 --> 6587.679
strategical

6584.599 --> 6591.04
misunderstanding that's what you do

6587.679 --> 6591.599
yes it is really my birthday crying out

6591.04 --> 6595.119
loud

6591.599 --> 6595.119000000001
how many times i have to say it

6595.36 --> 6598.0
but yes

6600.239 --> 6606.879999999999
gaslighting oh am i getting close to

6603.76 --> 6609.360000000001
close to heart you feel

6606.88 --> 6610.159000000001
you feel like i'm actually gaslighting

6609.36 --> 6612.159
you

6610.159 --> 6613.36
that means i'm really getting somewhere

6612.159 --> 6616.08
right because

6613.36 --> 6619.199
yeah that's what you would feel when i'm

6616.08 --> 6621.76
getting close to reality

6619.199 --> 6622.32
it's not gaslighting it's actually true

6621.76 --> 6625.4400000000005
you're

6622.32 --> 6626.48
actually misunderstanding strategically

6625.44 --> 6629.839999999999
all these

6626.48 --> 6631.199
things that are established you're

6629.84 --> 6635.360000000001
misunderstanding them

6631.199 --> 6637.678999999999
on purpose because when we explain it

6635.36 --> 6638.639
you ignore it you don't listen to it

6637.679 --> 6641.76
even though it

6638.639 --> 6645.52
goes on a daily basis for

6641.76 --> 6648.159000000001
years years and you still don't hear it

6645.52 --> 6648.719
years you don't know how to let it sink

6648.159 --> 6650.96
in

6648.719 --> 6652.8
right that's called strategic

6650.96 --> 6654.639
misunderstanding

6652.8 --> 6656.719
you don't understand you can't hear it

6654.639 --> 6660.88
you don't remember it

6656.719 --> 6664.84
on purpose on purpose not by your

6660.88 --> 6668.32
willing choice but by your subconscious

6664.84 --> 6669.599
drive because it has to fight for your

6668.32 --> 6673.28
belief

6669.599 --> 6676.88
your subconscious so it helps you

6673.28 --> 6679.28
prevent the facts

6676.88 --> 6681.84
from sinking in and that's what you're

6679.28 --> 6681.84
suffering from

6689.599 --> 6694.400000000001
yes unicorn laser eyes it is my birthday

6693.04 --> 6697.679
today

6694.4 --> 6702.32
february the 6th every year

6697.679 --> 6702.32
that's right can you stop asking now

6706.719 --> 6711.04
a single pic no no no no there's not a

6709.119 --> 6713.5199999999995
single pick ethically speaking

6711.04 --> 6716.239
black swan is all over the place there

6713.52 --> 6719.4400000000005
are black swan observations

6716.239 --> 6723.04
all around us all kinds of sites

6719.44 --> 6724.0
very far sites very low observation

6723.04 --> 6727.44
heights

6724.0 --> 6730.08
that make the geometry of the ball earth

6727.44 --> 6731.199
impossible because the natural

6730.08 --> 6735.5199999999995
consequences

6731.199 --> 6739.119
are not happening in those pictures

6735.52 --> 6742.639
so it's geometrically disproved

6739.119 --> 6744.48
it's disproven the globe yeah it's not a

6742.639 --> 6747.4400000000005
single picture just because we

6744.48 --> 6748.959999999999
use that picture a lot every time the

6747.44 --> 6750.799999999999
black swan is brought up doesn't mean

6748.96 --> 6754.719
it's the only picture

6750.8 --> 6758.320000000001
it's full of those pictures

6754.719 --> 6761.44
lots of pictures pictures like a deck

6758.32 --> 6762.799999999999
like five years ago and pictures 100

6761.44 --> 6766.799999999999
years ago

6762.8 --> 6770.719
too many pictures proof the earth is not

6766.8 --> 6774.159000000001
a geometric sphere as proclaimed

6770.719 --> 6778.159
because then you could never ever

6774.159 --> 6781.598999999999
see that far and there is no optics

6778.159 --> 6786.159
mechanic that can make

6781.599 --> 6790.0
you see that far on a sphere

6786.159 --> 6793.04
there is no such mechanic

6790.0 --> 6795.52
in optics that doesn't exist

6793.04 --> 6797.599
because any conjured mechanic like

6795.52 --> 6800.639
terrestrial refraction

6797.599 --> 6804.0
suggests falsely that the

6800.639 --> 6807.04
actual horizon itself

6804.0 --> 6809.52
the place where the sky meets the ground

6807.04 --> 6810.4
apparently it appears to meet there

6809.52 --> 6813.280000000001
right

6810.4 --> 6815.04
it there is no optics effect that can

6813.28 --> 6817.759999999999
displace the horizon

6815.04 --> 6818.96
in relation to the horizon to where

6817.76 --> 6822.56
that's supposed to be

6818.96 --> 6825.599
happening that doesn't exist

6822.56 --> 6828.400000000001
you understand there is no

6825.599 --> 6829.679
optics effect that can displace the

6828.4 --> 6834.0
horizon

6829.679 --> 6837.76
in relation to the horizon

6834.0 --> 6843.28
can only displace objects

6837.76 --> 6843.280000000001
visuals in relation to the horizon

6846.32 --> 6851.5199999999995

6946.48 --> 6950.32
actually provide the real evidence for

6948.719 --> 6953.04
that

6961.04 --> 6965.76
into it revealing that they're wrong if

in the world proven established science

7005.119 --> 7009.839999999999
and mechanics

7006.239 --> 7013.04
that are real empirical

7009.84 --> 7013.76
for centuries right based on that

your ball illusions
