well at least it's not raining

92.4 --> 97.04
it's a big kind of a big gray soup up

94.799 --> 97.04
there

97.439 --> 103.6
some distinct clouds still hang around

101.28 --> 103.6
but

105.04 --> 109.759
yeah

106.88 --> 112.24
not so much wind

109.759 --> 114.399
clouds are not rushing by up there

112.24 --> 118.56
unlike yesterday

114.399 --> 118.56
and it's just not storming entirely

119.6 --> 123.91999999999999
right in contrast to yesterday

124.32 --> 128.759
when it was storming and raining pretty

126.88 --> 131.92
much the entire day

128.759 --> 134.95899999999997
[Music]

131.92 --> 137.76
pretty heavily even like after

134.959 --> 143.16
the early bird show ended it

137.76 --> 143.16
like really started to hit off out there

143.44 --> 147.599
so but then later

145.44 --> 150.8
pretty much early in the night it it

147.599 --> 152.0
kind of stopped blowing out there and

150.8 --> 153.59900000000002
calmed down

152.0 --> 157.4
so

153.599 --> 157.39999999999998
did have a good sleep

159.76 --> 164.16
anyway

160.72 --> 166.72
hello youtube first in chat crockett

164.16 --> 168.56
good to see you

166.72 --> 171.04

171.04 --> 174.04
2022.

175.519 --> 179.04

right

192.72 --> 196.68
so how are you guys doing

202.64 --> 206.39999999999998
yeah the flat earth debate yesterday was

204.4 --> 208.64000000000001
all the talk about

206.4 --> 210.31900000000002
david weiss

208.64 --> 213.79899999999998
on the

210.319 --> 213.79899999999998
on that show

214.48 --> 220.07999999999998
with the other dave guy

218.4 --> 222.56
i forgot his name professor dave

220.08 --> 222.56
whatever

223.519 --> 228.56
but yeah i couldn't really add much to

225.36 --> 228.56
it because i haven't watched it

229.28 --> 232.56
right so i didn't really get too much

231.04 --> 234.959
involved yesterday at the flat earth

232.56 --> 234.959
debates

236.239 --> 241.439
it was kind of nice just

238.08 --> 243.84
calming down after all that

241.439 --> 246.879
yesterday's spider fled earth early bird

243.84 --> 246.879
was pretty intense

250.239 --> 255.519
dave was at homing quite a bit yeah

254.08 --> 258.79900000000004
so i heard

255.519 --> 258.799
it's to be expected

265.33 --> 268.8
[Music]

266.84 --> 272.44
yeah

268.8 --> 272.44
hey bortis boy

285.36 --> 291.84000000000003

287.36 --> 294.84000000000003
i didn't know you had bike ride videos

291.84 --> 294.84
hmm

306.72 --> 310.03900000000004

317.199 --> 321.479
yeah i might check it out

324.24 --> 327.24
huh

334.26 --> 337.399
[Music]

338.4 --> 345.41999999999996
you do secret streams okay youtube

342.37 --> 345.42
[Music]

348.16 --> 351.84000000000003
but it all depends though you know when

350.08 --> 353.75899999999996
you're gonna premiere them if you're

351.84 --> 355.52
gonna premiere them like right during

353.759 --> 358.47900000000004
the flat earth debate yeah then nobody's

355.52 --> 358.479
gonna pick up on it

360.24 --> 364.28000000000003
so i don't know when it's premiering

372.72 --> 375.72
um

391.84 --> 395.84
right

393.28 --> 399.35999999999996
man yesterday

395.84 --> 401.039
uh like made by jimbo

399.36 --> 403.36
another live stream

401.039 --> 405.199
really good as usual

403.36 --> 406.72
i had this guy on and i've seen him

405.199 --> 408.479
before on there

406.72 --> 410.72
the bear got an

408.479 --> 413.599
astrology bear

410.72 --> 416.40000000000003
but that guy like is really into

413.599 --> 416.4
esoterics

416.56 --> 422.96
and man they just really keep rolling

419.68 --> 425.28000000000003
that conversation man it's pretty heavy

422.96 --> 425.28
[ __ ]

428.4 --> 431.88
hey land linux

449.039 --> 453.199
right but yeah it was interesting stream

453.599 --> 458.389
jim bob

455.35 --> 458.389
[Music]

462.639 --> 465.639
see

467.039 --> 469.68
what else

471.84 --> 479.0
oh yeah yeah i just watched this

474.24 --> 479.0
video jaren upload about buzz aldrin

480.08 --> 483.35999999999996
that was pretty funny

481.599 --> 486.599
like not like the first time i've seen

483.36 --> 486.599
that but

502.639 --> 505.039
oh yeah

505.759 --> 511.199
tony sleeping warrior

508.879 --> 514.8000000000001
video where basically just going through

511.199 --> 518.24
a chat with professor phil bell

514.8 --> 520.64
but he put like this exotic war music in

518.24 --> 522.9590000000001
the background and made it all exciting

520.64 --> 524.88
even though it's just another

522.959 --> 527.76
chat back and forth

524.88 --> 527.76
but it was funny

528.88 --> 531.6
just

529.76 --> 535.56
typical conversation

531.6 --> 535.5600000000001
with anti-flat earthers

540.959 --> 545.5999999999999
yeah other than that

543.839 --> 549.839
i haven't really been

545.6 --> 549.839
watching too too much

565.12 --> 568.12
hmm

588.24 --> 592.8
yeah

589.12 --> 592.8
three or six yeah he does

593.76 --> 597.88
but i come on what do you expect

614.56 --> 619.92
yeah yeah today's show is going to be a

616.72 --> 622.0
calm one i hope not boring but

619.92 --> 623.8389999999999
like yesterday was so incredibly

622.0 --> 626.0
restless

623.839 --> 630.9200000000001
i already felt it coming like before

626.0 --> 630.92
that i already said like oh restless

632.24 --> 639.519
and it literally helped

634.64 --> 639.519
like afterward i was very relaxed

639.839 --> 644.48
because i got that [ __ ] out because

641.519 --> 645.76
that's like stuff that just keeps

644.48 --> 647.6
like

645.76 --> 650.3199999999999
seeping in

647.6 --> 653.36
and then just slowly getting fuller and

650.32 --> 656.0
fuller over time as i'm exposed to media

653.36 --> 656.0
in general

657.12 --> 663.36
and then that comes out

660.48 --> 666.0
i just hope that it

663.36 --> 667.92
can find some purpose out there

666.0 --> 671.44
in some way that somebody gets the

667.92 --> 671.4399999999999
message one way or the other

671.839 --> 676.48
because it does frustrate me to no end

678.16 --> 682.36
like situation in america

688.959 --> 692.56
right also just kind of disturbing

691.519 --> 695.2
things

692.56 --> 697.8389999999999
now coming out in china again like what

695.2 --> 700.32
they're doing in shanghai they're

697.839 --> 705.36
just doing some new lockdown and they're

700.32 --> 706.8000000000001
so brutal it's crazy

705.36 --> 710.639
like literally

706.8 --> 712.639
people in hazmat suits beating up

710.639 --> 716.76
people on the street

712.639 --> 716.76
like what the [ __ ] man

717.6 --> 720.16
so yeah

720.48 --> 725.279
it's like any credit in i might have

723.12 --> 728.16
given in some sort of a

725.279 --> 731.2
demons demonstrated way

728.16 --> 733.68
to china in the past in the past month

731.2 --> 733.6800000000001
or so

740.16 --> 744.399
like i don't even understand why they do

742.32 --> 747.6
that at this point like why would that

744.399 --> 747.6
even be necessary

754.8 --> 758.639
anyone can take

756.639 --> 762.32
bob seriously after the netflix

758.639 --> 762.32
documentary is beyond me

763.92 --> 766.3199999999999
really

767.44 --> 773.74
but if you just only watched

771.279 --> 776.88
beyonce beyond the curve right

773.74 --> 779.36
[Music]

776.88 --> 781.8389999999999
do you even get to see enough of him to

779.36 --> 784.8000000000001
really make it a proper judgment about

781.839 --> 786.72
his character and ability

784.8 --> 790.0
let

786.72 --> 792.0790000000001
i mean i think just watching his conduct

790.0 --> 793.279
here on youtube and all that and in

792.079 --> 796.399
chats

793.279 --> 796.399
is much more

796.88 --> 802.24
yeah much more

799.36 --> 804.88
upfront about like

802.24 --> 804.88
who he is

806.079 --> 810.959
right okay yeah if you watch globe yeah

808.16 --> 813.6
but then you're already then you know

810.959 --> 815.76
the guy already right if you just watch

813.6 --> 817.839
that one documentary

815.76 --> 819.76
and that's all you get to see of him i

817.839 --> 821.1990000000001
wouldn't really be able to tell anything

819.76 --> 824.639
about him

821.199 --> 827.279
except like he's just a guy

824.639 --> 829.199
and then apparently he gets confused

827.279 --> 831.8389999999999
about

829.199 --> 834.639
a gyroscope rotating and then it

831.839 --> 837.6800000000001
basically that's the end of his part

834.639 --> 840.16
they just cut it off there

837.68 --> 840.16
that's it

840.24 --> 845.519
if i remember correctly it has been

842.16 --> 845.519
years since i've seen that

846.32 --> 850.5600000000001
but i think just watching globe busters

853.68 --> 857.079
i think that

858.32 --> 862.0
would make it much more obvious

864.32 --> 869.32
just the way he talks in the presence of

866.32 --> 869.32
others

873.76 --> 878.079
yeah anti effie is constantly whining

876.16 --> 881.04
about it which is like the dumbest thing

878.079 --> 881.04
you could ever do

882.16 --> 885.8389999999999
like

883.199 --> 885.8389999999999
uh

887.6 --> 894.5600000000001
it's just being a gamma towards fed

892.24 --> 897.36
that's actually this is really pathetic

894.56 --> 901.68
it actually only serves to

897.36 --> 901.6800000000001
like boost our ratings it really does

908.32 --> 912.82
and intentionally gets into trouble many

910.32 --> 915.889
times yeah yeah

912.82 --> 915.889
[Music]

940.72 --> 945.759
fvd should have a bigger audience than

942.8 --> 948.959
glow busters but i think we do

945.759 --> 948.9590000000001
i i really think we do

950.0 --> 954.72
i mean globe busters

952.56 --> 956.6389999999999
has fans

954.72 --> 958.8000000000001
not gonna just stick there right but

956.639 --> 960.72
they're more like just hanging around

958.8 --> 964.0
fans

960.72 --> 968.36
i mean do any of these people

964.0 --> 968.36
even interact with globers

969.839 --> 974.5600000000001
just going by some vague memories of

972.0 --> 974.56
doing that

975.12 --> 978.8
i mean

976.0 --> 981.44
the entire globe busters

978.8 --> 984.959
panel and everything that's detected

981.44 --> 989.2790000000001
none of them are like really proficient

984.959 --> 989.279
at dealing with globes except for gerund

992.959 --> 998.959
right and the rest

995.04 --> 998.959
they have their experiences but

1002.079 --> 1005.279
like

1002.88 --> 1009.279
i've never really heard any accurate

1005.279 --> 1010.8
detailed psychological analysis

1009.279 --> 1013.92
i mean it

1010.8 --> 1017.68
they bring in psychology a little

1013.92 --> 1017.68
but it's not very well developed

1019.759 --> 1025.039
so yeah from what i've seen in the chats

1022.959 --> 1026.72
also just glowbuster just has a lot of

1025.039 --> 1028.799
people that just hang around they're

1026.72 --> 1031.1200000000001
just like oh this is our group this is

1028.799 --> 1032.079
our place

1031.12 --> 1033.839
right

1032.079 --> 1037.6
at fed

1033.839 --> 1040.3999999999999
it's a very different type of landscape

1037.6 --> 1040.3999999999999
very different

1040.88 --> 1045.6000000000001
well first off we let

1043.039 --> 1047.679
opponents in the chat right

1045.6 --> 1049.4399999999998
that doesn't happen in globe busters at

1047.679 --> 1051.8400000000001
all

1049.44 --> 1055.919
they ban anybody they ban people if you

1051.84 --> 1058.32
just said yeah if you look at them wrong

1055.919 --> 1060.4
if you look at bob wrong this is very

1058.32 --> 1062.96
different place

1060.4 --> 1066.799
and a lot more people

1062.96 --> 1068.0
just kind of come by fed

1066.799 --> 1070.72
and then

1068.0 --> 1074.88
after a while they kind of learned it

1070.72 --> 1074.88
and then they go do something else

1076.08 --> 1080.799
right more people come and go at fvd

1078.96 --> 1083.8400000000001
over the years

1080.799 --> 1085.36
but the funny thing is like

1083.84 --> 1087.28
there's a lot of people out there that

1085.36 --> 1089.52
have been with fed

1087.28 --> 1092.6399999999999
like hanging around even years ago and

1089.52 --> 1095.6399999999999
they still remember it

1092.64 --> 1095.64
right

1095.679 --> 1101.52
they're not just stuck to the arguments

1099.039 --> 1103.36
of the time and then hang on to that

1101.52 --> 1106.36
because that's not what we do constantly

1103.36 --> 1106.36
develop

1109.679 --> 1115.3200000000002
yeah that's right linux it is a bit of

1111.84 --> 1115.32
an echo chamber

1136.24 --> 1141.28
rightist version of wokeness

1146.88 --> 1152.4
i don't that's weird rightist whoa

1150.72 --> 1154.88
trying to figure out what your me what

1152.4 --> 1154.88
you mean

1157.84 --> 1162.3999999999999
is it you just mean the anti left

1162.84 --> 1169.12
right which are gammas anti-left people

1166.72 --> 1170.799
are just obsessed with leftists that's

1169.12 --> 1173.9189999999999
all they think about is they just want

1170.799 --> 1176.9189999999999
to make fun of them they seek them out

1173.919 --> 1176.919
too

1180.88 --> 1185.6000000000001
but they're not really

1183.12 --> 1186.7199999999998
right wing

1185.6 --> 1189.4399999999998
right

1186.72 --> 1191.1200000000001
no right wing

1189.44 --> 1193.679
they might think themselves right wing

1191.12 --> 1196.559
but no right winger that's actually

1193.679 --> 1196.5590000000002
really serious

1196.96 --> 1202.039
would like get caught in that kind of

1199.039 --> 1202.039
behavior

1208.32 --> 1212.48
all right so it's like like anti-flat

1210.64 --> 1215.919
earthers

1212.48 --> 1217.84
are specifically anti-flat earth

1215.919 --> 1219.44
not globus

1217.84 --> 1221.1999999999998
right so

1219.44 --> 1224.159
you could make that same distinction

1221.2 --> 1226.72
like anti-woke are people that are just

1224.159 --> 1228.96
anti-woke but they don't really have an

1226.72 --> 1230.88
alternative so they still get dragged

1228.96 --> 1232.96
towards that frequency

1230.88 --> 1236.3200000000002
and they effectively become like woke

1232.96 --> 1239.2
but exactly the opposite

1236.32 --> 1240.72
so more like anti-woke it's just

1239.2 --> 1243.8400000000001
safany's

1240.72 --> 1243.84
obsessed with woke

1245.44 --> 1248.919
against it

1261.12 --> 1266.3999999999999
right and i i have like utter disdain

1264.32 --> 1267.36
for woke

1266.4 --> 1269.8400000000001
but

1267.36 --> 1272.1589999999999
i like i don't obsess over i don't go

1269.84 --> 1273.9189999999999
out of my way

1272.159 --> 1276.96
i think they're actually just kind of

1273.919 --> 1278.48
pathetic the only problem is is that

1276.96 --> 1281.679
patheticness

1278.48 --> 1282.96
in this age is seductive

1281.679 --> 1285.6000000000001
like

1282.96 --> 1287.919
ignorance being bliss

1285.6 --> 1289.6789999999999
is almost like a market strategy now

1287.919 --> 1292.48
right and that's the problem with woke

1289.679 --> 1295.039
is that so many people are just

1292.48 --> 1298.96
caught up in it and then they become

1295.039 --> 1298.96
dumb and then that's useless

1301.84 --> 1304.3999999999999
but

1303.6 --> 1308.32
yeah

1304.4 --> 1308.3200000000002
it's just mental illness really

1311.12 --> 1317.9189999999999
like thinking that you can just bypass

1315.28 --> 1319.76
the normal spiritual mechanics in a way

1317.919 --> 1322.0800000000002
that's really what it what it tries to

1319.76 --> 1325.6
do it's just like no we're

1322.08 --> 1329.3999999999999
going to make our own moral rules

1325.6 --> 1329.3999999999999
which is insane

1333.039 --> 1337.76
like completely bypassing the

1335.12 --> 1337.76
foundations

1339.12 --> 1342.12
right

1351.679 --> 1355.679
right yeah yeah we were thinking the

1353.44 --> 1358.24
same thing matthew like

1355.679 --> 1363.1200000000001
we're basically trying to conjure up a

1358.24 --> 1363.1200000000001
new word for that right it's not easy

1363.28 --> 1367.2
right first the need arrives and then

1365.44 --> 1369.039
you're like yeah you know what it is and

1367.2 --> 1372.0
then you're trying to figure out which

1369.039 --> 1374.559
words would express it the best

1372.0 --> 1376.48
with contextual history and reflections

1374.559 --> 1378.1589999999999
to how we talked how other things have

1376.48 --> 1380.88
been named right

1378.159 --> 1382.96
so that's why i thought yeah

1380.88 --> 1385.5200000000002
just call it anti-woke just like

1382.96 --> 1387.28
anti-flat earthers

1385.52 --> 1390.0
people that get obsessed with the

1387.28 --> 1392.0
opponent but thereby lose track of any

1390.0 --> 1395.039
original ground and they basically

1392.0 --> 1397.84
partially become the opponent

1395.039 --> 1400.24
through their obsession

1397.84 --> 1403.24
and it all falls kind of under savanya's

1400.24 --> 1403.24
syndrome

1404.0 --> 1408.0
they're all very gamma in nature

1410.96 --> 1413.2
right

1415.44 --> 1420.799
but yeah i don't really mind like

1417.76 --> 1422.96
anti-woke people too much right

1420.799 --> 1425.279
i like i can go a lot get along with

1422.96 --> 1427.44
them very easily like i have no problem

1425.279 --> 1429.44
making fun of that at all

1427.44 --> 1431.679
i actually kind of enjoy it making fun

1429.44 --> 1434.88
of woke

1431.679 --> 1437.44
like i it's more fun to make fun of them

1434.88 --> 1439.919
than to just be pissed off at it and

1437.44 --> 1443.3600000000001
it's existence

1439.919 --> 1445.76
it's just that yeah if you're anti-woke

1443.36 --> 1448.3999999999999
that doesn't automatically make you some

1445.76 --> 1450.24
kind of a genius right

1448.4 --> 1452.3200000000002
and that's the problem a lot of people

1450.24 --> 1456.72
do kind of think like oh

1452.32 --> 1457.6
i'm on the right side so i'm the best

1456.72 --> 1459.84
uh

1457.6 --> 1459.84
no

1460.4 --> 1465.52
you have to keep developing you have to

1462.08 --> 1467.6789999999999
overcome the spell and then let it fade

1465.52 --> 1469.9189999999999
and then move beyond it so you can

1467.679 --> 1471.76
literally just

1469.919 --> 1473.8400000000001
see it and analyze it at a distance

1471.76 --> 1475.76
without it touching you that's the place

1473.84 --> 1478.08
you want to attain

1475.76 --> 1480.4
and yeah by being anti-woke and

1478.08 --> 1482.32
constantly seeking it out and constantly

1480.4 --> 1484.72
complaining about it

1482.32 --> 1487.36
or trying to poke fun at them

1484.72 --> 1489.279
you're not doing that

1487.36 --> 1491.84
you're actually migrating towards the

1489.279 --> 1491.84
frequency

1492.159 --> 1497.919
to deal with it right

1494.559 --> 1500.559
but then it just will become about ego

1497.919 --> 1503.1200000000001
more it always does

1500.559 --> 1506.96
part of the sephora syndrome right

1503.12 --> 1506.9599999999998
always victim to their own egos

1510.4 --> 1515.52
okay yeah youtube is really cool could

1512.64 --> 1517.8400000000001
you stop talking about like camera

1515.52 --> 1517.84
things

1521.12 --> 1526.559
we don't need like yeah a technical

1524.08 --> 1529.039
manual on how you convert your videos in

1526.559 --> 1533.6399999999999
my chat thanks

1529.039 --> 1533.64
yeah we'll see when you get it done

1549.679 --> 1552.159
yeah yeah

1554.799 --> 1561.12
right

1555.679 --> 1561.1200000000001
yeah matthew it's a very old story right

1562.64 --> 1566.48
like

1563.76 --> 1567.6
think about it like even for example

1566.48 --> 1569.279
story

1567.6 --> 1572.32
the video game

1569.279 --> 1575.039
diablo is just that it's like the that

1572.32 --> 1577.52
entire video game saga is all about that

1575.039 --> 1580.08
it's like uh they have a champion they

1577.52 --> 1582.6399999999999
go after the great monster

1580.08 --> 1585.12
then their experience traumatized them

1582.64 --> 1587.8400000000001
they become possessed and then they

1585.12 --> 1590.0
become the new incarnation

1587.84 --> 1593.039
of diablo

1590.0 --> 1595.36
that's how that story works well that's

1593.039 --> 1596.48
kind of based on things that

1595.36 --> 1599.4399999999998
yeah

1596.48 --> 1602.159
unreal spirit mechanics

1599.44 --> 1603.919
so it's a huge danger

1602.159 --> 1606.159
if you become obsessed with the enemy

1603.919 --> 1608.4
you might figure out their strategy

1606.159 --> 1609.5200000000002
but their strategy

1608.4 --> 1613.6000000000001
is

1609.52 --> 1615.2
the evil and if you learn about its

1613.6 --> 1618.08
function

1615.2 --> 1620.64
you're effectively eating from the from

1618.08 --> 1622.799
the apple from the tree of knowledge of

1620.64 --> 1624.3200000000002
good and evil you see

1622.799 --> 1627.9189999999999
to know

1624.32 --> 1630.799
their strategy will tempt you

1627.919 --> 1633.039
to at some point use it and if even if

1630.799 --> 1637.279
you consciously don't want to

1633.039 --> 1639.36
your ego might try it out

1637.279 --> 1640.799
because you can't always have your ego

1639.36 --> 1643.52
under control

1640.799 --> 1645.76
it's very dangerous

1643.52 --> 1645.76
right

1652.0 --> 1657.12
and that's also why

1654.559 --> 1659.6789999999999
if you think somebody or an opponent is

1657.12 --> 1660.7199999999998
using a terrible strategy and you hate

1659.679 --> 1664.159
it

1660.72 --> 1665.3600000000001
never take that strategy as your own

1664.159 --> 1668.0800000000002
just to

1665.36 --> 1668.8799999999999
counter the balance

1668.08 --> 1672.48
and

1668.88 --> 1675.0390000000002
nobody would naturally want to do that

1672.48 --> 1678.08
right unless you really don't care and

1675.039 --> 1680.48
you just want to win no matter what

1678.08 --> 1683.84
then you copy whatever whatever dirty

1680.48 --> 1683.84
tactic is out there

1684.399 --> 1686.9599999999998
right but then you're effectively

1685.84 --> 1689.84
already possessed because you're

1686.96 --> 1693.96
obsessed with winning

1689.84 --> 1693.9599999999998
which is kind of demonic

1706.559 --> 1709.559
hmm

1728.64 --> 1732.039
it's disgusting

1754.48 --> 1757.48
right

1776.48 --> 1780.48
man steamy traveler really isn't coming

1778.64 --> 1783.039
back

1780.48 --> 1783.039
it seems

1787.279 --> 1792.88
but i think i i just kind of got on his

1790.08 --> 1795.6789999999999
nerves over time

1792.88 --> 1799.8400000000001
he was always really good at like

1795.679 --> 1803.76
asking good questions breaking eyes but

1799.84 --> 1806.9599999999998
it just seemed more and more impatient

1803.76 --> 1811.44
as time was passing

1806.96 --> 1811.44
and then eventually he got on my nerves

1811.919 --> 1815.44
just with his impatience

1816.24 --> 1822.72
yeah but i do kind of miss him

1818.799 --> 1825.039
because he always had good questions

1822.72 --> 1826.559
right but yeah people come and go

1825.039 --> 1828.96
there's nothing really that can be done

1826.559 --> 1828.96
about it

1829.36 --> 1835.4399999999998
and maybe

1831.44 --> 1837.679
maybe like dealing with me as a person

1835.44 --> 1840.159
does kind of come with an exploration

1837.679 --> 1844.0800000000002
date maybe most people just

1840.159 --> 1845.919
after a while they just get sick of me

1844.08 --> 1848.96
i get it

1845.919 --> 1851.5200000000002
i get sick of me too

1848.96 --> 1853.679
especially when i'm like really intense

1851.52 --> 1856.399
now of course in general you kind of

1853.679 --> 1859.919
come to expect that of me but what if in

1856.399 --> 1862.08
that moment you really couldn't like it

1859.919 --> 1865.279
really hit the wrong spot or something

1862.08 --> 1868.32
yeah i'd get sick of me too

1865.279 --> 1868.32
i totally get that

1874.64 --> 1881.8400000000001
right it doesn't mean however that i

1877.44 --> 1885.2
really have the ability to change that

1881.84 --> 1888.0
like i'm just trying to

1885.2 --> 1890.559
remain stable

1888.0 --> 1893.36
yeah and after yesterday

1890.559 --> 1896.1589999999999
yeah that sounds kind of funny maybe

1893.36 --> 1898.32
oh really you call that stable

1896.159 --> 1901.3600000000001
yeah it was

1898.32 --> 1904.84
because it was controlled

1901.36 --> 1907.6789999999999
it wasn't imploding inwards

1904.84 --> 1909.6
right which is also something that can

1907.679 --> 1911.8400000000001
happen with that same type of energy it

1909.6 --> 1915.039
can implode inwards and then it like

1911.84 --> 1917.76
starts that energy literally attacks

1915.039 --> 1917.76
your organs

1917.84 --> 1920.84
like

1921.84 --> 1926.399
yeah

1924.08 --> 1928.8799999999999
i'm not even gonna like

1926.399 --> 1931.12
test that sort of thing

1928.88 --> 1932.3200000000002
but i know from the past when i was much

1931.12 --> 1934.7199999999998
younger

1932.32 --> 1936.96
and i also had these kind of explosive

1934.72 --> 1939.039
moments

1936.96 --> 1940.72
especially when i was high consciousness

1939.039 --> 1943.12
right it always happens when my

1940.72 --> 1944.96
consciousness goes high

1943.12 --> 1947.84
and then start to like put down the

1944.96 --> 1950.64
spirit mechanics like i did on sunday

1947.84 --> 1953.6789999999999
well when i'm higher consciousness

1950.64 --> 1956.159
i also basically

1953.679 --> 1960.159
without even realizing it at first pick

1956.159 --> 1962.88
up more detail of the darkness and evil

1960.159 --> 1965.8400000000001
and so it's almost inevitably going to

1962.88 --> 1968.96
be followed up by a rage

1965.84 --> 1968.9599999999998
to burn that off

1969.679 --> 1973.919
it's like

1972.0 --> 1975.679
like the high p consciousness moment

1973.919 --> 1979.679
like sunday

1975.679 --> 1981.76
would be like a concentrated oxygen blue

1979.679 --> 1984.24
flame right super

1981.76 --> 1987.6
focused super hot

1984.24 --> 1990.88
can melt any type of metal

1987.6 --> 1993.1999999999998
but there's a byproduct

1990.88 --> 1994.7990000000002
by product is kind of like the other

1993.2 --> 1996.96
stuff

1994.799 --> 2000.24
that doesn't really burn optimally and

1996.96 --> 2001.919
it's gonna then build up

2000.24 --> 2003.76
and i need to like burn that off too

2001.919 --> 2006.7990000000002
like dead wood

2003.76 --> 2009.2
and that's rage win

2006.799 --> 2011.84
really when i become rage win in a way

2009.2 --> 2013.6000000000001
you could see that as me burning off

2011.84 --> 2017.399
that wood

2013.6 --> 2017.399
spiritual spiritually

2018.64 --> 2024.3200000000002
and you could even derive that from the

2021.919 --> 2027.88
themes that i typically talk about when

2024.32 --> 2027.8799999999999
i am like that

2041.97 --> 2047.48
[Music]

2044.48 --> 2047.48
hmm

2072.48 --> 2075.48
hmm

2078.159 --> 2086.599
oh i yeah i bumped into a

2081.76 --> 2086.599
little meme picture that i want to share

2088.0 --> 2094.159
i never ignored you youth

2091.76 --> 2094.159
dude

2101.119 --> 2106.88
whoa yout's breaking open again

2104.72 --> 2108.7999999999997
right anyway i wanted to show something

2106.88 --> 2111.599
that's not really related but just the

2108.8 --> 2115.6400000000003
cartoon of it

2111.599 --> 2115.6400000000003
really stood out to me

2118.4 --> 2121.44
some meme thing

2125.119 --> 2129.1600000000003
you might have seen it somewhere

2131.2 --> 2136.1189999999997
can you read that

2132.72 --> 2136.1189999999997
i hope so

2156.96 --> 2161.92
right but this is my kind of humor

2160.24 --> 2164.16
and there's probably something to it as

2161.92 --> 2165.92
well

2164.16 --> 2168.92
so i just wanted to share that for a

2165.92 --> 2168.92
moment

2185.119 --> 2189.359
i'll just link you up straight to the

2186.88 --> 2189.359
picture

2191.44 --> 2198.119
is that the dude from the goonies yeah

2193.44 --> 2198.119
kind of is yeah that's right

2202.48 --> 2206.4
you feel like the guy on the left like

2204.8 --> 2208.1600000000003
most days

2206.4 --> 2210.079
oh [ __ ]

2208.16 --> 2214.68
that's not good

2210.079 --> 2214.6800000000003
i feel like the guy on the right though

2214.72 --> 2221.16
i mean i even have a weird cloak to

2217.52 --> 2221.16
accompany that

2225.64 --> 2228.75
[Music]

2248.48 --> 2251.44
what

2249.44 --> 2253.92
do you two do what the hell are you

2251.44 --> 2258.32
talking about man

2253.92 --> 2258.32
you seem to be going off on a tangent

2262.48 --> 2267.44
you always make about

2265.119 --> 2269.04
the point you make about vocals pendulum

2267.44 --> 2273.2000000000003
having weight and being affected by

2269.04 --> 2277.16
magnetism pure crits it crickets on fh

2273.2 --> 2277.16
i've talked about it

2285.2 --> 2291.2
i think that the entire

2287.359 --> 2292.4
focal pendulum is just a scam

2291.2 --> 2295.2799999999997
i mean

2292.4 --> 2296.96
pendulums don't just start

2295.28 --> 2299.52
swinging

2296.96 --> 2300.64
out of themselves by themselves right

2299.52 --> 2301.7599999999998
which

2300.64 --> 2304.16
yeah

2301.76 --> 2306.2400000000002
why don't you try like a pendulum while

2304.16 --> 2308.96
on the roundabout

2306.24 --> 2311.359
it's not gonna hang down straight

2308.96 --> 2314.88
it won't

2311.359 --> 2316.7999999999997
there's gonna be weird deviations in any

2314.88 --> 2318.4
swing of a pendulum if you do it on a

2316.8 --> 2321.6800000000003
roundabout

2318.4 --> 2321.6800000000003
right i've talked about that

2322.56 --> 2326.2799999999997
this like

2330.48 --> 2335.839
stuff that makes the globe outrageous

2332.8 --> 2338.8390000000004
that never get talked about

2335.839 --> 2341.68
dude where the hell have you

2338.839 --> 2343.119
been i mean like

2341.68 --> 2347.1189999999997
the first

2343.119 --> 2349.6800000000003
three years of fed were just that

2347.119 --> 2352.6400000000003
and i was a big part of it right i love

2349.68 --> 2355.2799999999997
to basically get to any point about the

2352.64 --> 2359.839
globe cosmology or the machinations and

2355.28 --> 2359.8390000000004
then roll out a whole plethora

2359.92 --> 2365.2000000000003
of errors

2362.24 --> 2367.5989999999997
and just things

2365.2 --> 2371.3199999999997
that don't work about it like so where

2367.599 --> 2371.32
have you been youtube

2382.56 --> 2386.96
yeah

2383.52 --> 2391.32
that might not be a uh

2386.96 --> 2391.32
a bad question there borders boy

2405.28 --> 2409.6800000000003
oh it never gets talked about this never

2407.359 --> 2412.56
gets talked about that

2409.68 --> 2415.839
what you we constantly have to just

2412.56 --> 2418.0789999999997
engage in presupposing their model just

2415.839 --> 2420.48
to prove it wrong

2418.079 --> 2422.7200000000003
why why would we do that youtube all

2420.48 --> 2425.68
you're going to do is reinforce the

2422.72 --> 2428.56
outdated mechanism it's just

2425.68 --> 2431.839
listeners all they'll be doing is just

2428.56 --> 2434.0789999999997
get the old toy out of the closet again

2431.839 --> 2435.92
and then play make them play with it in

2434.079 --> 2438.96
their mind and then like oh it's also

2435.92 --> 2440.96
wrong guess what they're gonna be

2438.96 --> 2443.44
playing with it again

2440.96 --> 2445.92
right that's part of it

2443.44 --> 2448.319
it's part of why it's pointless

2445.92 --> 2449.04
to just

2448.319 --> 2451.599
go

2449.04 --> 2453.7599999999998
to any globe argument all of the time

2451.599 --> 2456.1600000000003
and point out how it's wrong

2453.76 --> 2457.8390000000004
i mean i like to do that i think it's

2456.16 --> 2460.72
fun i think it's entertaining i think

2457.839 --> 2464.96
it's actually like a game

2460.72 --> 2467.839
because yeah the globe cosmology

2464.96 --> 2469.359
is like one of the most fallacious

2467.839 --> 2471.68
things

2469.359 --> 2473.92
humanity has ever conceived

2471.68 --> 2475.839
right so it's very hard not to do it

2473.92 --> 2478.88
once you see that

2475.839 --> 2481.119
but it doesn't help other people it just

2478.88 --> 2482.6400000000003
makes them go through the same things

2481.119 --> 2484.6400000000003
over and over again making them

2482.64 --> 2485.52
presuppose

2484.64 --> 2487.7599999999998
then

2485.52 --> 2492.319
when their conscious

2487.76 --> 2495.0400000000004
moment memories of that fade away

2492.319 --> 2496.16
after a whole bunch of time they'll just

2495.04 --> 2498.72
remember

2496.16 --> 2500.7999999999997
oh yeah the mechanism

2498.72 --> 2502.7999999999997
they won't remember how it's all

2500.8 --> 2505.8390000000004
fallacious they'll just remember that

2502.8 --> 2509.8390000000004
there is that

2505.839 --> 2509.839
that's how that effectively works

2511.28 --> 2514.6400000000003
if you make somebody constantly

2512.96 --> 2517.2
presuppose

2514.64 --> 2519.04
then in the future there's a chance that

2517.2 --> 2521.5989999999997
they'll forget

2519.04 --> 2526.04
it's a presupposition and instead

2521.599 --> 2526.04
remember everything about it

2537.119 --> 2542.2400000000002
what talking about what's wrong about

2539.68 --> 2543.9199999999996
the club model isn't presupposing that

2542.24 --> 2546.0789999999997
model

2543.92 --> 2549.28
well

2546.079 --> 2553.3590000000004
yeah it kind of is

2549.28 --> 2556.0
youtube it is because you can only even

2553.359 --> 2557.68
entertain their globe model

2556.0 --> 2560.56
by laying down a whole bunch of

2557.68 --> 2560.56
presuppositions

2560.72 --> 2566.56
so you're incorrect

2562.8 --> 2566.5600000000004
it is presupposing

2567.28 --> 2573.92
and it has psychological effects side

2570.16 --> 2573.92
effects on the long run

2574.16 --> 2577.16
right

2586.48 --> 2592.599
yeah exposed to globe model as nonsense

2588.72 --> 2592.5989999999997
that it is cool

2593.2 --> 2598.319
but

2594.88 --> 2601.2000000000003
in people's memories they still need

2598.319 --> 2603.04
a viable alternative right

2601.2 --> 2604.96
so

2603.04 --> 2606.96
if we just constantly focus on how the

2604.96 --> 2610.2400000000002
globe is wrong

2606.96 --> 2612.48
then you're not going to replace it

2610.24 --> 2613.52
it's just going to be a tag on the

2612.48 --> 2616.16
memory

2613.52 --> 2619.48
of like oh yeah that guy always thinks

2616.16 --> 2619.48
it's wrong

2620.16 --> 2623.68
but you're just gonna remember the model

2622.319 --> 2625.119
anyway

2623.68 --> 2627.359
right

2625.119 --> 2630.0
so is that what we're gonna do now we're

2627.359 --> 2632.0789999999997
gonna teach the future generations

2630.0 --> 2633.359
the globe model on how everything is

2632.079 --> 2636.6400000000003
wrong about it

2633.359 --> 2639.0789999999997
so that like in three four generations

2636.64 --> 2642.0
our children will be able to just make

2639.079 --> 2646.2400000000002
presentations on the run explaining

2642.0 --> 2646.24
exactly how the globe model is wrong

2647.359 --> 2653.04
yeah

2648.72 --> 2653.04
you you think that's gonna help anything

2653.599 --> 2657.839
no it's just another way of making us

2656.56 --> 2661.319
remember

2657.839 --> 2661.319
the globe model

2665.359 --> 2669.44
need for replacement is their problem

2667.52 --> 2671.52
for the it's a problem for those that

2669.44 --> 2674.0
want to believe

2671.52 --> 2676.4
in a model yeah

2674.0 --> 2679.92
but the problem is also is that just

2676.4 --> 2679.92
generally people out there

2680.0 --> 2686.079
that don't have supreme enthusiasm for

2683.44 --> 2688.079
all this and the mechanical faculties to

2686.079 --> 2691.04
get it quickly

2688.079 --> 2694.7200000000003
they're just gonna be facing the globe

2691.04 --> 2694.72
model all the time

2695.09 --> 2698.26
[Music]

2712.72 --> 2717.2
remembering why it's wrong

2715.28 --> 2719.28
why is that a bad thing because it takes

2717.2 --> 2723.9199999999996
up a lot of space

2719.28 --> 2727.6800000000003
it's basically learning a toy by heart

2723.92 --> 2730.48
like you learn everything about that toy

2727.68 --> 2731.2799999999997
it's still just a toy why would you want

2730.48 --> 2734.079
to

2731.28 --> 2737.3590000000004
spend faculties

2734.079 --> 2738.5600000000004
on just knowing the toy

2737.359 --> 2742.0789999999997
i mean

2738.56 --> 2744.56
i'm not against it i'm like yeah leave

2742.079 --> 2747.76
the globe model out there don't ban it

2744.56 --> 2749.119
don't destroy everything about it

2747.76 --> 2751.5200000000004
just

2749.119 --> 2753.76
leave it there as a puzzle as a mystery

2751.52 --> 2755.44
for those that are interested

2753.76 --> 2756.48
and that want to figure it out don't

2755.44 --> 2759.44
force

2756.48 --> 2761.839
that on people don't make it a new

2759.44 --> 2761.839
tradition

2762.16 --> 2766.48
to be like oh we got to remember

2764.4 --> 2769.44
everything why the globe is wrong what a

2766.48 --> 2769.44
waste of time

2769.52 --> 2773.28
i mean you could teach your kid

2771.76 --> 2775.76
a craft

2773.28 --> 2777.76
instead a practical craft you could

2775.76 --> 2779.28
teach them to be a plumber or a

2777.76 --> 2780.88
carpenter

2779.28 --> 2783.88
or a farmer

2780.88 --> 2783.88
something

2792.0 --> 2798.359
just let the globe model be there for

2794.48 --> 2798.359
those that are curious

2806.16 --> 2809.16
so

2820.079 --> 2825.2000000000003
what's up with these stupid random

2822.56 --> 2829.119
comments [ __ ] off

2825.2 --> 2832.24
i don't need your random comments bots

2829.119 --> 2832.2400000000002
get the [ __ ] out

2832.8 --> 2838.0
if you're gonna say something make

2835.04 --> 2841.52
[ __ ] sense

2838.0 --> 2843.599
like use words that are like you like if

2841.52 --> 2846.0
you're gonna be some stupid copy paste

2843.599 --> 2848.2400000000002
but then at least

2846.0 --> 2851.04
be involved in what we're doing here

2848.24 --> 2855.3999999999996
don't just stupid random comments about

2851.04 --> 2855.4
nothing [ __ ] off trolls

2866.18 --> 2869.31
[Music]

2879.04 --> 2883.2
yeah yeah youtube cool that's really

2881.119 --> 2884.6400000000003
cool

2883.2 --> 2886.5589999999997
yeah

2884.64 --> 2889.92
yeah we remember everything else that's

2886.559 --> 2892.8
wrong too yeah oh wash our hands

2889.92 --> 2894.7200000000003
yeah how's that working out yeah

2892.8 --> 2895.6800000000003
need some more alcohol squirt on your

2894.72 --> 2897.5989999999997
hands

2895.68 --> 2900.64
uh oh oh yeah yeah that's actually

2897.599 --> 2902.4
unhealthy yeah it's unhealthy

2900.64 --> 2904.7999999999997
if you wash your hands too much it's

2902.4 --> 2906.0
actually bad did you learn that on top

2904.8 --> 2910.76
of that

2906.0 --> 2910.76
no but that's where people go

2915.28 --> 2920.0
they're just going to do something with

2918.0 --> 2922.4
it

2920.0 --> 2923.44
effectively negating the original

2922.4 --> 2926.1600000000003
message

2923.44 --> 2927.839
it's what people do when you make them

2926.16 --> 2930.3999999999996
learn something that they don't

2927.839 --> 2933.44
understand they're gonna get creative

2930.4 --> 2935.839
with it and take it out of context is

2933.44 --> 2939.92
what people do youtube

2935.839 --> 2942.0789999999997
don't you understand it's human nature

2939.92 --> 2945.119
they're gonna do something with it other

2942.079 --> 2947.119
than what it was intended for

2945.119 --> 2949.76
if you're just gonna teach everybody how

2947.119 --> 2952.079
the globe model is is wrong

2949.76 --> 2955.079
you're gonna have that be a thing in

2952.079 --> 2955.079
schools

2967.35 --> 2970.48
[Music]

2971.52 --> 2974.96
oh yeah great

2975.76 --> 2979.28
i'm not saying narrative wash your hands

2978.079 --> 2981.599
but there's

2979.28 --> 2982.8390000000004
like just because it's a thing doesn't

2981.599 --> 2986.4
mean

2982.839 --> 2988.48
that it can't go wrong there's people

2986.4 --> 2989.44
now that are germaphobes and that are

2988.48 --> 2992.16
like

2989.44 --> 2994.96
have to wash their hands all the time

2992.16 --> 2998.48
it's not actually healthy for them

2994.96 --> 3001.52
right that's why i mentioned that

2998.48 --> 3003.839
it can go wrong

3001.52 --> 3005.2
you can't contain it like that you

3003.839 --> 3009.119
cannot

3005.2 --> 3012.3999999999996
prevent globals and anti-flat earthers

3009.119 --> 3014.2400000000002
from coming into existence and just as

3012.4 --> 3017.119
you cannot prevent

3014.24 --> 3020.16
people from coming into existence that

3017.119 --> 3021.599
decide to be hardcore satanist you

3020.16 --> 3022.3999999999996
cannot

3021.599 --> 3023.3590000000004
do

3022.4 --> 3024.839
that

3023.359 --> 3027.7999999999997
it's

3024.839 --> 3029.7599999999998
impossible youtube

3027.8 --> 3033.44
impossible

3029.76 --> 3035.119
you cannot force the choice

3033.44 --> 3036.7200000000003
structures

3035.119 --> 3037.92
of people

3036.72 --> 3040.3999999999996
you can't

3037.92 --> 3042.16
not even [ __ ] ai can do that and

3040.4 --> 3044.48
they're trying they're tired trying with

3042.16 --> 3047.2799999999997
all their might all they can do is just

3044.48 --> 3049.92
make you exposed to that which they hope

3047.28 --> 3052.1600000000003
you'll stay dwelling upon

3049.92 --> 3053.44
and then demoralize you so you don't

3052.16 --> 3055.359
look beyond

3053.44 --> 3057.2000000000003
that's what they do it's the best they

3055.359 --> 3061.24
could have achieved in that direction

3057.2 --> 3061.24
and it's a horror show

3071.44 --> 3075.599
imagine if you never watch your hands

3073.839 --> 3077.839
which is how do you know that's what

3075.599 --> 3080.319
people used to do how do you know

3077.839 --> 3080.319
youtube

3080.8 --> 3084.8
i mean if there was just never water

3083.28 --> 3086.88
available

3084.8 --> 3088.319
then sure but if there is water

3086.88 --> 3091.599
available

3088.319 --> 3093.52
people kind of intuitively want to wash

3091.599 --> 3095.28
their hands especially when it's like

3093.52 --> 3097.839
really disgusting

3095.28 --> 3097.8390000000004
you know

3100.079 --> 3104.6400000000003
like

3100.96 --> 3107.119
even animals do that

3104.64 --> 3110.16
youtube you realize that

3107.119 --> 3113.1600000000003
animals seek out water to wash

3110.16 --> 3113.16
themselves

3135.76 --> 3141.119
yeah borders boy yeah it's disgusting

3138.64 --> 3143.68
and like i smell all the chemicals like

3141.119 --> 3146.8
i smell i don't even smell the parf the

3143.68 --> 3149.44
perfume i just smell the chemicals

3146.8 --> 3152.48
so sometimes like some people and like

3149.44 --> 3155.119
their living spaces are like god this is

3152.48 --> 3156.72
like a chemical refinery and it just

3155.119 --> 3159.599
like

3156.72 --> 3159.5989999999997
get get away

3161.52 --> 3166.64
why do they do it because it probably

3163.92 --> 3169.28
intoxicates them in a weird way and they

3166.64 --> 3170.24
lose their sense of smell

3169.28 --> 3172.0
right

3170.24 --> 3174.4799999999996
if you're gonna use all that chemical

3172.0 --> 3177.599
stinky [ __ ] what's gonna happen is you

3174.48 --> 3180.72
literally lose your sense of smell over

3177.599 --> 3182.559
time you don't smell it anymore

3180.72 --> 3185.2
why is that that's a protective

3182.559 --> 3186.6400000000003
mechanism

3185.2 --> 3188.72
it's like oh you're in a toxic

3186.64 --> 3190.72
environment you're not able to get away

3188.72 --> 3192.7999999999997
because you would have that's your

3190.72 --> 3194.319
bodily intuition telling you that so

3192.8 --> 3195.8390000000004
then it's gonna okay then we're just

3194.319 --> 3197.92
gonna turn it down so it doesn't bother

3195.839 --> 3202.16
you so much

3197.92 --> 3202.16
that's how people get used to stink too

3202.8 --> 3206.319
including this stink and a chemical

3205.119 --> 3209.839
waste

3206.319 --> 3209.839
that's in their perfumes

3211.52 --> 3216.92
and in their disgusting mcdonald's food

3260.96 --> 3266.2400000000002
thank you for that background

3262.319 --> 3266.24
information seeing star wars yeah yeah

3266.4 --> 3270.319
that's funny that

3268.0 --> 3270.319
yeah

3272.8 --> 3277.3590000000004
this is exactly what it's like

3275.28 --> 3278.4
it just blocks it you just don't smell

3277.359 --> 3280.319
it anymore

3278.4 --> 3284.1600000000003
and if you've been exposed to that long

3280.319 --> 3286.5589999999997
enough like every you get like freaky

3284.16 --> 3288.96
smell and taste rotations too it just

3286.559 --> 3291.3590000000004
[ __ ] up the entire system

3288.96 --> 3294.559
your sensor is terrible

3291.359 --> 3297.52
like i hate perfumes

3294.559 --> 3299.8390000000004
like if it's not directly coming from

3297.52 --> 3304.44
like a plant extract or anything i don't

3299.839 --> 3304.44
want to have anything to do with it

3306.64 --> 3311.2
not that i like the smell of every

3308.319 --> 3313.2799999999997
single plant out there but at least it's

3311.2 --> 3318.5989999999997
better than like

3313.28 --> 3318.599
chemical chemically weaponized smells

3334.0 --> 3338.319
babies crying also yeah yeah

3336.48 --> 3340.72
i've noticed that and i don't even have

3338.319 --> 3340.72
a kid

3340.799 --> 3343.92
but

3341.599 --> 3346.1600000000003
the way babies cry they do kind of send

3343.92 --> 3347.359
out an impulse exactly as to what's

3346.16 --> 3349.5989999999997
wrong

3347.359 --> 3351.68
and some mothers are just perfect they

3349.599 --> 3355.6800000000003
can hear it they can hear exactly what

3351.68 --> 3355.68
their baby is crying about it's amazing

3360.839 --> 3365.68
75 balls of perfume jesus

3363.92 --> 3369.4
what are you gonna do with all that

3365.68 --> 3369.3999999999996
seeking star water

3380.48 --> 3384.559
yeah it's amazing juice i've

3382.799 --> 3386.319
unfortunately have never been privy to

3384.559 --> 3390.4
that experience

3386.319 --> 3394.0
but i have kind of tapped into that

3390.4 --> 3394.0
with other kids and babies

3396.4 --> 3399.6800000000003
like i

3397.44 --> 3402.799
i got weird things where i get really

3399.68 --> 3406.96
impatient when i hear a kid or baby

3402.799 --> 3409.7599999999998
crying and then i can literally feel

3406.96 --> 3411.92
for example that the mother is dissonant

3409.76 --> 3413.76
with it and can't respond properly and

3411.92 --> 3417.2000000000003
then the kid keeps crying i can feel

3413.76 --> 3420.079
that and i get really like

3417.2 --> 3422.24
yeah i i what i want to do intuitively

3420.079 --> 3424.0
i'm never going to do that is like walk

3422.24 --> 3427.359
up to that mother and like slap them in

3424.0 --> 3429.359
the face like hello hello

3427.359 --> 3430.799
wake the [ __ ] up

3429.359 --> 3434.5589999999997
connect

3430.799 --> 3434.559
you're not connecting to your kid

3434.88 --> 3441.119
could you imagine the person actually

3436.88 --> 3441.119
doing that no that would be crazy but

3442.4 --> 3448.4
i have that sometimes like

3445.44 --> 3450.64
why aren't you just connecting

3448.4 --> 3451.76
you don't like you shouldn't have to do

3450.64 --> 3454.24
that

3451.76 --> 3456.4
you you shouldn't have to have that

3454.24 --> 3458.8799999999997
problem ever with your kid

3456.4 --> 3460.799
if you just connect

3458.88 --> 3462.7200000000003
just connect that spiritual element

3460.799 --> 3464.559
where you interface

3462.72 --> 3466.3999999999996
you don't get cut off right if you're

3464.559 --> 3468.3190000000004
actually depressed by the way especially

3466.4 --> 3470.48
as a mother that's very problematic

3468.319 --> 3474.52
because depression typically does make

3470.48 --> 3474.52
you retreat and cut off

3487.68 --> 3492.8799999999997
hmm

3489.119 --> 3495.76
okay that's weird flatter sage

3492.88 --> 3498.48
yeah i can't imagine it either

3495.76 --> 3501.88
i have a very strong but all my senses

3498.48 --> 3501.88
are very strong

3502.16 --> 3509.1189999999997
my hearing is my sight's very accurate

3505.76 --> 3509.119
my sense of smell is great

3509.599 --> 3514.48
although it can be a huge bother right

3512.72 --> 3515.7599999999998
because there's plenty of situations

3514.48 --> 3518.16
where it's like oh yeah we're gonna go

3515.76 --> 3521.2000000000003
with this group

3518.16 --> 3523.52
and everybody's like yay and i'm like oh

3521.2 --> 3526.319
god what the [ __ ] dude

3523.52 --> 3526.319
you stink

3527.2 --> 3534.5589999999997
so having a very strong

3530.24 --> 3534.5589999999997
smell sensor isn't always a great thing

3534.64 --> 3538.8799999999997
yeah or a convenient thing it is a great

3536.96 --> 3541.88
thing it's probably better but it's not

3538.88 --> 3541.88
convenient

3554.24 --> 3556.9599999999996
like oh

3557.44 --> 3562.2400000000002
like the smell of pigs for example like

3559.68 --> 3565.04
in pig farm with pig poo

3562.24 --> 3566.8799999999997
god like when i was a kid i had some

3565.04 --> 3567.839
like where i went to a farm to work and

3566.88 --> 3570.2400000000002
stuff

3567.839 --> 3572.4
learned a bit about that actually very

3570.24 --> 3574.64
therapeutical

3572.4 --> 3576.88
i also went to like a pig farmer once

3574.64 --> 3580.0
and it just

3576.88 --> 3581.599
i could spend like 30 seconds inside of

3580.0 --> 3586.44
that actual building and then i

3581.599 --> 3586.44
literally ran out and almost vomited

3586.88 --> 3593.2000000000003
like that concentrated pig [ __ ] smell is

3590.4 --> 3598.119
so terrible

3593.2 --> 3598.1189999999997
it's like a nightmare to me

3602.72 --> 3607.68
and it's even weirder because

3604.799 --> 3610.4
when i like watch a movie in which there

3607.68 --> 3613.2799999999997
is that like for example

3610.4 --> 3615.6800000000003
mad max thunderdome where they basically

3613.28 --> 3617.76
build a methane plant out of it how to

3615.68 --> 3619.839
pick [ __ ]

3617.76 --> 3621.6800000000003
when i watch that

3619.839 --> 3624.319
i like watch

3621.68 --> 3625.68
like almost trying to take a distance

3624.319 --> 3628.319
from the screen

3625.68 --> 3629.52
because of the memory smell association

3628.319 --> 3630.72
i'm like

3629.52 --> 3632.48
dude

3630.72 --> 3634.64
if you've never smelled that you'll be

3632.48 --> 3639.359
like oh yeah sure oh it'll stink like

3634.64 --> 3642.96
poo no no no no no no pig [ __ ] is that's

3639.359 --> 3643.92
not just like poo it that stuff is

3642.96 --> 3646.64
so

3643.92 --> 3646.64
disgusting

3648.559 --> 3653.52
right i mean i can't even imagine being

3651.359 --> 3655.52
like a pig farmer unless you literally

3653.52 --> 3657.52
have no sense of smell then it's like a

3655.52 --> 3660.4
super advantage because then you're

3657.52 --> 3663.4
impervious to that disgusting

3660.4 --> 3663.4
odor

3688.0 --> 3690.48
hey what

3693.76 --> 3697.559
really boris boy

3702.0 --> 3705.44
what how old is she

3707.119 --> 3710.839
too young oh

3716.48 --> 3719.76
well

3717.28 --> 3723.039
yeah i i don't know what that means like

3719.76 --> 3723.039
in her twenties or something

3725.599 --> 3727.839
right

3734.17 --> 3741.0
[Music]

3736.319 --> 3741.0
borders boy or borders old man

3744.17 --> 3748.96
[Music]

3746.88 --> 3750.48
well i don't think i'm too old for that

3748.96 --> 3753.359
at all

3750.48 --> 3756.319
right especially if they really want to

3753.359 --> 3759.359
want to be a housewife

3756.319 --> 3759.359
that's pretty amazing

3760.88 --> 3764.079
too volatile for me

3764.799 --> 3769.52
yeah well i can deal with volatile if

3767.599 --> 3772.6400000000003
you know what i mean

3769.52 --> 3774.48
i can actually like

3772.64 --> 3778.2
yeah

3774.48 --> 3778.2
i can deal with that

3782.96 --> 3785.76
right it's

3784.24 --> 3788.72
with young

3785.76 --> 3791.599
women the main problem is always that

3788.72 --> 3794.0789999999997
they just oh i want to be free or later

3791.599 --> 3795.76
i would have kids later

3794.079 --> 3798.4
and then they don't

3795.76 --> 3801.76
that's my problem

3798.4 --> 3803.76
not that they're crazy or like freaky

3801.76 --> 3807.8390000000004
women logic

3803.76 --> 3810.7200000000003
that just like numbs me sometimes

3807.839 --> 3813.0389999999998
no it's that they just they they just

3810.72 --> 3815.5989999999997
don't want to have kids and they can't

3813.039 --> 3817.44
be talked into it

3815.599 --> 3820.88
that's been my problem

3817.44 --> 3824.16
in in multiple occasions

3820.88 --> 3826.2400000000002
was with my ex

3824.16 --> 3828.96
and like

3826.24 --> 3831.0389999999998
my my third girlfriend too which was

3828.96 --> 3835.359
like which i consider to be like my

3831.039 --> 3835.3590000000004
first real love was the same issue

3835.839 --> 3839.0389999999998
although

3836.799 --> 3840.24
yeah then she did get kids later on with

3839.039 --> 3842.2400000000002
another guy

3840.24 --> 3844.3999999999996
which was like kind of a

3842.24 --> 3845.359
kick in the in the gut

3844.4 --> 3848.1600000000003
to me

3845.359 --> 3849.92
to find that out

3848.16 --> 3852.64
apparently i wasn't worthy but then

3849.92 --> 3854.799
again in that time frame yeah i really

3852.64 --> 3857.0389999999998
was kind of like

3854.799 --> 3857.0389999999998
not

3858.24 --> 3861.9599999999996
not super cool

3875.359 --> 3879.64
yes exactly where this boy

3883.839 --> 3889.599

[Music]

3921.839 --> 3923.92
you

3942.64 --> 3945.64
hmm

3951.28 --> 3954.7200000000003
how many women have regrets

3956.799 --> 3960.839
i don't know borders boy

3985.119 --> 3987.92
it's just that

3989.359 --> 3994.0789999999997
any woman that in my lifetime when they

3991.76 --> 3997.119
could have had kids

3994.079 --> 3999.92
were like no no i hate it

3997.119 --> 4002.4
if they come to me back later like oh i

3999.92 --> 4005.28
wish i would have done it i'm like

4002.4 --> 4008.319
go [ __ ] yourself

4005.28 --> 4008.3190000000004

4083.039 --> 4089.039
that is just pure evil

4085.68 --> 4091.0389999999998

4091.039 --> 4096.719
she never had any kids

4093.92 --> 4099.12

star wars

4215.52 --> 4217.84
oh

4233.76 --> 4238.719

4236.4 --> 4240.639999999999
we're not saying it's easy

4238.719 --> 4241.84
bearing children

4240.64 --> 4243.6
as men

4241.84 --> 4245.28
don't worry about it

4243.6 --> 4248.320000000001
we're mostly talk we're starting out

4245.28 --> 4250.5599999999995
with oh women that get regret later not

4248.32 --> 4252.719
doing it

4250.56 --> 4255.280000000001
no sympathy whatsoever

4252.719 --> 4257.36
you were seduced

4255.28 --> 4259.5199999999995
you thought it was okay

4257.36 --> 4262.0
and now you're screwed

4259.52 --> 4264.2390000000005
and i have no sympathy it has nothing to

4262.0 --> 4269.08
do with

4264.239 --> 4269.08
bearing children the ability to

4272.64 --> 4275.64
um

4299.6 --> 4302.6
hmm

4310.59 --> 4313.749
[Music]

4326.4 --> 4329.36
okay

4327.44 --> 4331.759999999999
well seeking star wars in that case

4329.36 --> 4334.639999999999
there's nothing that

4331.76 --> 4338.6
i guess you could have done about it

4334.64 --> 4338.6
i'm not blaming you

4346.88 --> 4356.04
look if by some happenstance you can't

4350.56 --> 4356.04
yeah i'm sorry sorry to hear that

4356.32 --> 4363.54
right it's not your fault

4359.76 --> 4364.8
but if you could have and you were like

4363.54 --> 4368.239
[Music]

4364.8 --> 4370.8
and then later in life you do yeah then

4368.239 --> 4372.799999999999
then i have no sympathy

4370.8 --> 4376.12
but sounds like that's not the case with

4372.8 --> 4376.12
you so

4401.6 --> 4405.679
yeah and i agree with that too geo

4403.199 --> 4407.919999999999
shifter i mean i don't think that women

4405.679 --> 4410.159
should not work at all

4407.92 --> 4412.4800000000005
but they should never be like put into

4410.159 --> 4414.96
like full-time labor

4412.48 --> 4414.959999999999
like that

4416.48 --> 4418.799999999999
right

4419.92 --> 4424.4
because hey work can be therapeutical

4422.4 --> 4427.12
for a woman too

4424.4 --> 4428.879999999999
it can be right but they shouldn't be

4427.12 --> 4432.0
like pushed in like

4428.88 --> 4434.719
eight hours a day in that cubicle

4432.0 --> 4437.12
no that's bad

4434.719 --> 4439.679
it's bad for men

4437.12 --> 4441.199
even it's worse for women

4439.679 --> 4443.6
it is

4441.199 --> 4445.839999999999
it literally will like screw with their

4443.6 --> 4448.84
internal wiring

4445.84 --> 4448.84
terrible

4459.6 --> 4462.6
so

4469.679 --> 4472.719
right

4470.56 --> 4474.8
yeah and besides if you have a more

4472.719 --> 4477.76
traditional homesteading

4474.8 --> 4479.679
setup with your kids and your wife

4477.76 --> 4483.84
then there should like

4479.679 --> 4483.84
there will always be plenty to do right

4484.0 --> 4488.159
i mean in a busy household

4489.04 --> 4493.48
there's always more to do

4509.6 --> 4513.56
right

4510.56 --> 4513.56
anyway

4530.38 --> 4533.51
[Music]

4550.84 --> 4556.719
right yeah borders boy it's it's a

4553.84 --> 4559.04
pretty precurious situation now that all

4556.719 --> 4561.84
happened

4559.04 --> 4564.719
also like it's almost like a straw man

4561.84 --> 4567.360000000001
situation right feminism after that's

4564.719 --> 4571.28
after that moment why

4567.36 --> 4571.28
well because basically

4572.08 --> 4579.96
the laws that are based on the normal

4574.48 --> 4579.959999999999
functioning of society were being abused

4580.0 --> 4584.159
they were being abused by the

4581.28 --> 4584.159
corporations

4584.48 --> 4589.5199999999995
like oh oh they don't cost as much oh

4587.199 --> 4591.759999999999
okay

4589.52 --> 4593.76
we're not gonna pay you as much

4591.76 --> 4596.0
right we're just like oh yeah it's a

4593.76 --> 4599.04
sort of an emergency situation but we're

4596.0 --> 4601.6
still not gonna like compensate

4599.04 --> 4603.6
and yeah if feminists

4601.6 --> 4605.679
don't like yeah women don't like to be

4603.6 --> 4606.719
exploited right

4605.679 --> 4609.04
like that

4606.719 --> 4610.96
so it was probably then that situation

4609.04 --> 4613.36
that just pushed them to like one

4610.96 --> 4616.0
equality not realizing that the entire

4613.36 --> 4621.0
setup was really meant

4616.0 --> 4621.0
for an entirely different scenario

4623.44 --> 4630.159
so yeah like the feminism arriving is

4626.64 --> 4630.159000000001
almost like a straw man

4634.08 --> 4639.36
like what should have happened instead

4636.4 --> 4640.159
is that the corporations should just be

4639.36 --> 4642.96
like

4640.159 --> 4644.799999999999
yeah that's cute but this is a special

4642.96 --> 4646.719
war situation

4644.8 --> 4648.2390000000005
so you are going to pay them out the

4646.719 --> 4652.159
same as if you

4648.239 --> 4652.159
men or like almost as much

4652.88 --> 4657.679
more

4654.88 --> 4657.679
to get it right

4660.88 --> 4665.12
and then leave it to that and return

4662.48 --> 4667.28
back to normal when the war is over but

4665.12 --> 4669.84
no

4667.28 --> 4674.36
what they did instead is basically make

4669.84 --> 4674.360000000001
the war continue on forever

weird

4891.6 --> 4896.0
right yeah geochef look the universal

4894.159 --> 4897.44
problem

4896.0 --> 4899.679
is not that

4897.44 --> 4901.28
women aren't treated equal now the

4899.679 --> 4905.6
problem is

4901.28 --> 4909.599999999999
is that wage slavery is becoming more

4905.6 --> 4911.76
and more overtly slavery you see

4909.6 --> 4912.96
in this age

4911.76 --> 4914.2390000000005

what you get out of that now for in

trade for what you really have to do for

4927.28 --> 4931.12
it

4928.96 --> 4932.96
is more

4931.12 --> 4936.4
slavery

4932.96 --> 4938.04
is more slavish more enslaved

4936.4 --> 4941.599999999999
than actual

4938.04 --> 4944.639
plantation slaves were

4941.6 --> 4946.8
in the 18th century

4944.639 --> 4949.04
they had more

4946.8 --> 4951.28
they got out of that

4949.04 --> 4955.199
yeah you see

4951.28 --> 4958.159
those slaves were actually guaranteed

4955.199 --> 4959.12
to attain their freedom if they worked

4958.159 --> 4961.599999999999
hard

4959.12 --> 4965.36
and followed the rules

4961.6 --> 4966.400000000001

4965.36 --> 4968.5599999999995
owner

4966.4 --> 4970.839999999999

4970.84 --> 4975.28
constitutional rights as a citizen that

4973.52 --> 4979.4400000000005
they would get yeah

4975.28 --> 4982.08
yeah how is that wage slave in the 21st

5124.239 --> 5127.678999999999
we're already calling them slave jobs

5126.719 --> 5130.08
right

5127.679 --> 5132.32
because that's like a recognition like

5130.08 --> 5135.12
wait yeah when you strip away the mind

5132.32 --> 5137.28
control it is a slave job but guess what

5135.12 --> 5139.5199999999995
it's a worse

5137.28 --> 5141.199
slave job

5139.52 --> 5145.84
than actual

5141.199 --> 5147.28
slavery in america in the 18th century

5145.84 --> 5150.0
yeah

5147.28 --> 5153.0
and that's a [ __ ] stone cold hard

5150.0 --> 5153.0
fact

5153.82 --> 5159.5
[Music]

5156.08 --> 5163.42
you've visited those places yeah right

5159.5 --> 5163.42
[Music]

5163.6 --> 5169.84
that's just silly yeah it's true though

5166.239 --> 5172.959999999999
and you've been propagandized

5169.84 --> 5174.400000000001
you've been absolutely propagandized the

5172.96 --> 5176.32
[ __ ] out of

5174.4 --> 5178.4
and hey what do you want you live in a

5176.32 --> 5181.36
communist world

5178.4 --> 5183.759999999999
whose one of their primary strategy is

5181.36 --> 5185.839999999999
to create victimhood consciousness in

5183.76 --> 5189.679
black population

5185.84 --> 5192.08
using over emphasizing and even just

5189.679 --> 5195.4800000000005
making up [ __ ]

5192.08 --> 5195.48
about slavery

5202.56 --> 5207.52
no you have no idea what you're talking

5204.239 --> 5210.5199999999995
about and get the [ __ ] out of here

5207.52 --> 5210.52
ass

5210.88 --> 5215.88
[ __ ] off

5212.88 --> 5215.88
numpty

5225.51 --> 5228.589
[Music]

5239.28 --> 5243.44
yeah that's right borders boy

5241.52 --> 5245.120000000001
work for a few years and you got land

5243.44 --> 5247.12
and citizenship

5245.12 --> 5250.88
and that actually

5247.12 --> 5250.88
meant something back then

5253.199 --> 5258.0
that would actually represent something

5258.239 --> 5264.959999999999
yeah you could literally become a

5261.44 --> 5267.36
wealthy person out of that

5264.96 --> 5269.6
as an ex-slave

5267.36 --> 5271.92
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

5269.6 --> 5273.1990000000005
talking about a man like me

5271.92 --> 5276.159
like how

5273.199 --> 5279.44
how can you become a prominent rich

5276.159 --> 5281.199
person from doing a [ __ ] slave job

5279.44 --> 5283.44
there's people that are doing that for

5281.199 --> 5286.08
like 20 years and if they don't commit

5283.44 --> 5288.159
suicide from total burnout

5286.08 --> 5289.44
they're definitely not going to end up

5288.159 --> 5291.92
rich

5289.44 --> 5295.678999999999
right the only people that do kind of

5291.92 --> 5298.56
end up rich like that are like in

5295.679 --> 5300.32
specialist sales

5298.56 --> 5302.719
it's very niche and

5300.32 --> 5305.28
like you have to have very specific

5302.719 --> 5305.28
talents

5305.84 --> 5310.32
right

5307.28 --> 5313.28
regular slave jobs are not like that

5310.32 --> 5317.679
you don't get

5313.28 --> 5317.679
upgraded at the end of the ride

5318.32 --> 5322.4
it's all been stripped away all those

5320.159 --> 5324.5599999999995
advantage of the growth possibility has

5322.4 --> 5326.879999999999
been stripped away

5324.56 --> 5328.639
because the people that designed the

5326.88 --> 5330.56
structures

5328.639 --> 5332.159000000001
for all this

5330.56 --> 5333.120000000001
want to

5332.159 --> 5336.839999999999
kill

5333.12 --> 5336.84
you all

5337.36 --> 5340.159
you understand

5340.88 --> 5347.92
people that had slaves in america in the

5343.76 --> 5351.04
18th century did not want to kill them

5347.92 --> 5354.2390000000005
all they actually just wanted good

5351.04 --> 5356.88
reliable workers and then

5354.239 --> 5359.759999999999
give something in return an opportunity

5356.88 --> 5362.639
an equal opportunity citizenship

5359.76 --> 5362.639
right land

5363.6 --> 5368.159000000001
that's the difference

5365.6 --> 5369.679
they wouldn't just like have slaves and

5368.159 --> 5371.599999999999
then like okay

5369.679 --> 5374.2390000000005
well you're old now so you're going to

5371.6 --> 5374.96
the shack over there and then shoot them

5374.239 --> 5377.44
no

5374.96 --> 5379.76
they would set them free they did not

5377.44 --> 5380.96
want to kill everybody that's the

5379.76 --> 5383.360000000001
difference

5380.96 --> 5386.4
the people now in control mega

5383.36 --> 5390.0
corporations that design this [ __ ] for

5386.4 --> 5394.679
you to work in want to kill you all

5390.0 --> 5394.679
don't you get it that's the difference

5406.4 --> 5410.48
and you're very lucky in this age if you

5408.88 --> 5411.679
even find

5410.48 --> 5414.32
anybody

5411.679 --> 5416.08
that even wants to be like

5414.32 --> 5417.759999999999
the old ways

5416.08 --> 5419.679
that actually want good for their

5417.76 --> 5422.400000000001
workers

5419.679 --> 5425.36
you have to go look now because those

5422.4 --> 5429.28
people usually get routed out by mega

5425.36 --> 5429.28
corporations through schemes

5430.239 --> 5434.44
and just financial sabotage

5438.48 --> 5443.599999999999
so you're just going to end up with

5440.4 --> 5447.599999999999
these eugenicist mega corporation madman

5443.6 --> 5450.4800000000005
that design things for you to do

5447.6 --> 5451.360000000001
in order to kill yourself

5450.48 --> 5453.839999999999
yeah

5451.36 --> 5456.639
that's the difference

5453.84 --> 5459.04
i'd rather be back in the 18th century

5456.639 --> 5462.56
as a good old slave because then at

5459.04 --> 5466.159
least i could dream of a future

5462.56 --> 5468.56
and actually it might just come true it

5466.159 --> 5471.12
was very likely to come true it would be

5468.56 --> 5474.2390000000005
outrageous if it weren't

5471.12 --> 5477.92
right and a reputation was everything

5474.239 --> 5480.239
back then so if you lied

5477.92 --> 5484.56
or you were like a murderer of slaves

5480.239 --> 5486.959999999999
that was not looked upon greatly

5484.56 --> 5489.6
you would get into trouble you would not

5486.96 --> 5493.04
get special positions right because it

5489.6 --> 5496.2390000000005
wasn't all corrupted to [ __ ] yet

5493.04 --> 5499.76
now evil is like floats to the top like

5496.239 --> 5503.239
a turd in a sewage plant

5499.76 --> 5503.2390000000005
that's the difference

5505.28 --> 5508.28
okay

5526.03 --> 5529.2699999999995
[Music]

5553.28 --> 5556.639999999999
[Music]

5585.76 --> 5591.92
sounds like i had a nice yeah i do

5589.12 --> 5596.76
my keyboard is very clicky it's like

5591.92 --> 5596.76
this keyboard's over 30 years old

5597.31 --> 5600.359
[Music]

5608.2 --> 5611.3099999999995
[Music]

5614.8 --> 5617.8
um

5638.65 --> 5641.87
[Music]

5676.639 --> 5679.639
huh

5704.159 --> 5708.159
yeah well borders boy

5706.159 --> 5710.879999999999
that's only in their system you see we

5708.159 --> 5710.879999999999
still have

5711.84 --> 5717.76
the rights that we can conquer for

5714.08 --> 5720.0
ourselves we have natural rights

5717.76 --> 5724.0
that nobody can tell us what we have and

5720.0 --> 5724.0
we haven't if we don't let them

5726.639 --> 5732.56
right so for the example i claim the

5730.4 --> 5735.28
right to self-defense

5732.56 --> 5737.76
i just claim it like i don't give a [ __ ]

5735.28 --> 5740.8
what anybody tells me about it

5737.76 --> 5742.639
i will defend myself with lethal force

5740.8 --> 5745.1990000000005
if necessary

5742.639 --> 5747.6
if the situation calls for it and i

5745.199 --> 5750.4
don't give a [ __ ]

5747.6 --> 5752.56
what anybody or anything is gonna do

5750.4 --> 5754.638999999999
about it or say about that

5752.56 --> 5756.719
because i claim

5754.639 --> 5760.4800000000005
the right

5756.719 --> 5761.92
you can't get right you can only claim

5760.48 --> 5763.759999999999
them

5761.92 --> 5764.96
once you realize that then you'll

5763.76 --> 5769.6
realize

5764.96 --> 5772.159
it doesn't even matter what the norm is

5769.6 --> 5775.56
you just have to claim it and that's

5772.159 --> 5775.5599999999995
what it is

5786.08 --> 5790.08
yeah with lethal force that's right

5795.28 --> 5801.119
i mean test me by all means

5798.88 --> 5804.719
why don't you try something else and and

5801.119 --> 5806.159
i'll see you i'll show you

5804.719 --> 5809.679
that yeah

5806.159 --> 5813.159
i can i can absolutely be lethal

5809.679 --> 5813.159
if it's necessary

5816.159 --> 5821.44
thing is though

5817.76 --> 5821.4400000000005
it's usually not necessary

5821.76 --> 5824.8
but

5822.719 --> 5826.4
if you're going to become obsessed by

5824.8 --> 5828.159000000001
getting out of the way

5826.4 --> 5830.799999999999
of it

5828.159 --> 5835.759999999999
not being lethal then

5830.8 --> 5835.76
you'll be driven more towards it

5839.44 --> 5844.08
because people will start to count on

5841.92 --> 5847.08
your avoidance of it

5844.08 --> 5847.08
huh

5860.639 --> 5864.96
ah there's some real triggered pieces of

5862.719 --> 5867.28
[ __ ] out there

5864.96 --> 5870.0
i don't like what i have to say

5867.28 --> 5872.5599999999995
we're gonna go back

5870.0 --> 5874.32
we're gonna go back i'm gonna take away

5872.56 --> 5878.159000000001
feminism

5874.32 --> 5881.84
take away all this [ __ ] reintroduce

5878.159 --> 5886.5599999999995
slavery the old-fashioned way right it's

5881.84 --> 5886.56
basically based on volunteerism right

5886.88 --> 5890.56
but a slave system could be a very good

5889.28 --> 5893.759999999999
thing

5890.56 --> 5896.159000000001
it would probably help us restore

5893.76 --> 5898.719
the massive amounts of psychological

5896.159 --> 5901.199
damage that have been has been inflicted

5898.719 --> 5905.04
upon us

5901.199 --> 5908.638999999999
it would help restore the natural order

5905.04 --> 5909.5199999999995
if we reintroduce slavery

5908.639 --> 5911.92
yeah

5909.52 --> 5914.2390000000005
i said it

5911.92 --> 5916.0
that's right

5914.239 --> 5917.678999999999
yeah i'm not even the first to say that

5916.0 --> 5918.96
it's like owen benjamin's been joking

5917.679 --> 5922.4
about this

5918.96 --> 5924.2390000000005
he's right i know it is the craziest

5922.4 --> 5926.799999999999
thing you could ever think of right in

5924.239 --> 5930.08
the face of everything but guess what

5926.8 --> 5933.92
yeah that oh so crazy it's all

5930.08 --> 5935.5199999999995
gaslighting it always was everything

5933.92 --> 5937.52
they threw at us

5935.52 --> 5940.400000000001
everything the beast has thrown at us

5937.52 --> 5941.320000000001
has all been gaslighting that's why we

5940.4 --> 5945.679
should do

5941.32 --> 5949.5199999999995
exactly the opposite of every freaking

5945.679 --> 5951.52
detail every single little detail into

5949.52 --> 5953.679
the minute

5951.52 --> 5957.52
everything they've ever thrown at us we

5953.679 --> 5960.8
should do exactly the opposite in every

5957.52 --> 5960.8
conceivable way

5961.6 --> 5967.4400000000005
and that is how we can

5963.679 --> 5970.08
absolutely destroy them

5967.44 --> 5973.04
destroy the beast because everything

5970.08 --> 5975.84
they told us was a lie no exception not

5973.04 --> 5978.96
even a minute one

5975.84 --> 5981.84
every detail they told us was wrong

5978.96 --> 5981.84
everything

5991.44 --> 5996.32
indentured servitude not slavery no no

5994.48 --> 5997.678999999999
that's just going to move the problem to

5996.32 --> 6000.639
financial

5997.679 --> 6003.4400000000005
slavery which is what that is no no but

6000.639 --> 6004.2390000000005
slavery can be

6003.44 --> 6007.638999999999
just

6004.239 --> 6007.638999999999
honor based

6008.56 --> 6012.2390000000005
like hey you're you're a [ __ ]

6010.639 --> 6015.76
criminal

6012.239 --> 6018.0
you can now choose to hang

6015.76 --> 6018.0
or

6018.08 --> 6023.199
maybe this guy over here will have mercy

6021.119 --> 6025.28
on you and you can be his slave for a

6023.199 --> 6027.199
while and he will judge you

6025.28 --> 6029.599999999999
on your performance and your personal

6027.199 --> 6029.599999999999
growth

6029.84 --> 6034.08
i don't know

6030.88 --> 6036.32
slavery not indentured servitude

6034.08 --> 6038.4
indentured servitude is the nightmare we

6036.32 --> 6040.88
are already at

6038.4 --> 6043.36
we are effectively indentured servants

6040.88 --> 6045.92
now in this beast system

6043.36 --> 6048.799999999999
where you never get enough never get

6045.92 --> 6051.6
enough to get what you really need

6048.8 --> 6053.76
yet you are manipulated to no end and

6051.6 --> 6055.92
you're forced you're forced to do it or

6053.76 --> 6058.400000000001
you'll lose everything

6055.92 --> 6062.159
yeah that's indentured servitude we're

6058.4 --> 6063.199
now in indentured servitude i say take

6062.159 --> 6065.92
it out

6063.199 --> 6069.678999999999
away with indentured servitude and

6065.92 --> 6073.1990000000005
reintroduce slavery

6069.679 --> 6077.0
that's right i'm saying it and i mean it

6073.199 --> 6077.0
you think about it

6082.0 --> 6086.0
who determines who the masters are in

6083.84 --> 6089.119000000001
the slaves i already told you that a man

6086.0 --> 6090.239
like me but you must be too triggered

6089.119 --> 6093.04
to

6090.239 --> 6095.199
put that [ __ ] out of your ears

6093.04 --> 6099.96
i already told you that

6095.199 --> 6099.96
but you didn't pay attention now did you

6107.199 --> 6111.5199999999995
for this to work someone needs to own a

6108.719 --> 6113.76
plantation who would that be well

6111.52 --> 6114.719
who wants to start a plantation

6113.76 --> 6116.719
right

6114.719 --> 6120.36
who's going to be a good master who's

6116.719 --> 6120.36
going to be a good masa

6122.08 --> 6125.92
and yeah

6123.6 --> 6130.159000000001
somebody can just say can i be your

6125.92 --> 6132.2390000000005
slave or as i said before

6130.159 --> 6135.28
right it's like uh help i don't know how

6132.239 --> 6137.199
to take care of myself i i need food can

6135.28 --> 6139.92
i

6137.199 --> 6141.839999999999
like work live here effectively being

6139.92 --> 6146.679
your slave and then there should be

6141.84 --> 6146.679
rules guiding that right

6148.0 --> 6151.28
okay so you can have that or you can

6149.92 --> 6153.6
have

6151.28 --> 6155.28
yeah a situation where somebody's like a

6153.6 --> 6157.280000000001
criminal

6155.28 --> 6159.599999999999
and then they

6157.28 --> 6161.599999999999
get an option like somebody can

6159.6 --> 6163.280000000001
basically take pity on them and then

6161.6 --> 6165.280000000001
accept them as their slave which would

6163.28 --> 6166.32
be conditional

6165.28 --> 6168.0
right

6166.32 --> 6170.799999999999
they would yeah

6168.0 --> 6172.48
instead of just dumping them in a jail

6170.8 --> 6173.679
where they will learn how to be

6172.48 --> 6175.599999999999
criminals

6173.679 --> 6178.32
they can be put

6175.6 --> 6180.4800000000005
to labor as slaves

6178.32 --> 6184.199
and actually learn something good and

6180.48 --> 6184.199
doing something productive

6196.56 --> 6201.52
that's right you shifter

6199.36 --> 6203.599999999999
let them squirt

6201.52 --> 6206.8
i'm just gonna do it i'm just gonna say

6203.6 --> 6208.8
it bring back slavery bing back slavery

6206.8 --> 6212.0
bring black

6208.8 --> 6214.0
no not black bring back slavery it's not

6212.0 --> 6217.679
neces it's not a racial thing right it's

6214.0 --> 6218.8
not like oh black slaves no no

6217.679 --> 6222.4800000000005
they're very

6218.8 --> 6222.4800000000005
unlikely to actually do that

6222.639 --> 6227.119
because like you don't want a black

6224.8 --> 6227.119000000001
slave

6228.08 --> 6233.199
and if you want to know why then follow

6230.639 --> 6235.52
owen benjamin and he'll tell you exactly

6233.199 --> 6237.839999999999
why you don't want black slaves

6235.52 --> 6237.84
right

6244.8 --> 6249.1990000000005
indentured conditional slave reasons

6249.679 --> 6254.2390000000005
right well i never said there should be

6252.0 --> 6256.08
unconditional it's not like oh you're

6254.239 --> 6258.48
not a human being anymore and we can

6256.08 --> 6260.239
just do whatever we want to you torture

6258.48 --> 6263.599999999999
that's not the type of slavery i'm

6260.239 --> 6265.759999999999
talking about not talking about just

6263.6 --> 6268.0
straight out barbarism that's completely

6265.76 --> 6270.4800000000005
useless it's just dehumanizing it

6268.0 --> 6273.04
invokes demons in people

6270.48 --> 6274.718999999999
that abuse the power of it no that's not

6273.04 --> 6275.84
the slavery i'm talking i'm talking

6274.719 --> 6278.2390000000005
about

6275.84 --> 6281.6
working slavery

6278.239 --> 6285.839999999999
the old american way

6281.6 --> 6285.84
