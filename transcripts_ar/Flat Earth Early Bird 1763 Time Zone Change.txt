Japanese

[Music]

208.68 --> 211.68
Japanese

219.36 --> 225.0

222.2 --> 228.11999999999998

225.0 --> 232.08
probably the same as

228.12 --> 232.08
yesterday 15Â°

233.64 --> 236.64
C

238.159 --> 243.439
right looks like it's it's going to be

240.439 --> 243.439
this type of weather all

244.76 --> 249.04
week hey LSG good to see

252.159 --> 262.959
you Dr utar good to see you yeah

258.479 --> 262.959
so the time uh

264.32 --> 271.8
changed so I don't know who all reset

268.16 --> 275.0
the times out there but over here we got

271.8 --> 278.44
set the the

275.0 --> 278.44
uh our

280.12 --> 285.039
[Music]

282.479 --> 289.28
back getting a lot of buffering yeah I

285.039 --> 289.28
had that a bit but I don't know just

292.07 --> 297.74
[Music]

298.56 --> 301.56
refresh

303.96 --> 308.08
all right anyway I feel well rested and

305.919 --> 310.79999999999995
I'm actually kind of happy

308.08 --> 313.4
about the time shift because that means

310.8 --> 313.40000000000003
that I can

313.6 --> 317.72
just well not worry about oversleeping

316.759 --> 320.84000000000003
so

317.72 --> 325.28000000000003
much so it's almost like my oversleeping

320.84 --> 328.28
just arrived as an anticipation of the

325.28 --> 328.28
the time change or

328.479 --> 336.71999999999997
something I don't know how that

331.319 --> 340.6
works but anyway yeah the uh time zone

336.72 --> 340.6
changed an hour

351.28 --> 355.55999999999995
again I'm a bit weirded out though isn't

354.6 --> 358.47900000000004
that

355.56 --> 361.319
usually the United States that does that

358.479 --> 366.199
first

361.319 --> 366.199
or did I just completely miss all of

366.44 --> 371.039
that cuz in my memory it's like always

368.8 --> 375.16
like the United

371.039 --> 375.15999999999997
States has the time shift

375.68 --> 380.12
first for like a week or maybe two weeks

378.56 --> 384.0
or something and

380.12 --> 384.0
then Europe changes

388.4 --> 393.19899999999996
too

390.479 --> 395.56
so did I miss time zone shift in the

393.199 --> 398.91900000000004
United States did I

395.56 --> 398.919
just miss

400.89 --> 408.0
[Music]

403.56 --> 408.0
that yeah one week difference

418.4 --> 423.96
okay

420.96 --> 423.96
right anyway that's

426.91 --> 434.12
[Music]

429.16 --> 434.12
happening all right anyway hello borders

437.639 --> 447.16
boy Dr utar already sent hello

443.36 --> 448.84000000000003
right oh man I was just watching

447.16 --> 450.59900000000005
finishing watching that's why I'm a

448.84 --> 452.599
little late

450.599 --> 455.039
I could have started right on time but I

452.599 --> 458.71999999999997
was watching mind and Vil's

455.039 --> 460.44
videos video he reviewed some movie he

458.72 --> 464.8
found from

460.44 --> 464.8
2014 it's like what the

467.08 --> 471.28
hell like a a Cabbage

472.0 --> 476.639
Patch

473.639 --> 480.039
factory movie it would and freaky it's

476.639 --> 484.68
kind of like crazy surreal

480.039 --> 487.12
almost horror but not overt the really

484.68 --> 487.12
bizarre

487.319 --> 492.44
movie that just slipped by

496.56 --> 502.159
apparently right I haven't actually

498.56 --> 505.64
watched the movie I mean I might look it

502.159 --> 507.96
up but it it just looks really weird and

505.64 --> 512.159
[Music]

507.96 --> 513.919
freaky Maybe a pretty maybe it would be

512.159 --> 517.56
a decent Halloween

513.919 --> 517.56
movie because it's so

519.2 --> 522.5600000000001
freaky I don't

528.04 --> 534.76
know we shift first and then you what

531.8 --> 537.76
are you saying that it switches

534.76 --> 537.76
around

538.04 --> 542.16
akumu I I've never heard of that

544.64 --> 549.92
one is that really is does that really

547.48 --> 552.5600000000001
happen can anybody here in the chat

549.92 --> 552.56
confirm

562.88 --> 568.12
that remember that being yeah I know

565.519 --> 571.12
there well there is that time difference

568.12 --> 571.12
thing

572.0 --> 576.079
but wasn't it with like Nathan CH that

574.68 --> 578.68
it's like

576.079 --> 580.16
late it starts an hour later for the

578.68 --> 583.64
United States because United States

580.16 --> 585.8389999999999
switch an hour back a week

583.64 --> 588.1999999999999
earlier that's how I remember it

585.839 --> 590.9590000000001
happening that's how I usually notice

588.2 --> 594.0
like hey it's all off time in the united

590.959 --> 597.3599999999999
like Info Wars is off in its timing

594.0 --> 602.04
because they switched an

597.36 --> 602.04
hour but I haven't noticed that at

605.519 --> 611.279
all may it's just not been watching very

613.9 --> 617.039
[Music]

619.8 --> 623.88
carefully not time she

628.04 --> 631.04
yet

648.16 --> 654.12
well yeah anyway maybe is maybe it does

651.519 --> 654.12
go back and

658.04 --> 661.04
forth

661.279 --> 664.92
and I just haven't paid that much

663.12 --> 670.16
attention I don't

664.92 --> 670.16
know whatever it is it's happening right

675.57 --> 679.5390000000001
[Music]
