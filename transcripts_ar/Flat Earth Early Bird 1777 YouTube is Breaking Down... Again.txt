[Music]

195.12 --> 202.31900000000002
well let me check because YouTube seems

198.48 --> 202.319
to be breaking down all over the

202.36 --> 206.4
place a Jesus still

208.68 --> 211.68
buffering

214.01 --> 224.789

short because well everybody that was

249.0 --> 256.4

256.4 --> 261.84

264.96 --> 269.96999999999997
[Music]

268.6 --> 277.309
you

269.97 --> 277.309
[Music]

278.16 --> 285.759
21 hours ago yeah YouTube is just having

282.68 --> 285.759
another breakdown

294.1 --> 297.28900000000004
[Music]

298.56 --> 301.56
again

312.6 --> 318.0
right okay so at least it's not just

315.44 --> 320.52
continual on everybody yesterday it it

318.0 --> 322.68
really did sound like just everybody

320.52 --> 325.28
couldn't watch my stream it was just

322.68 --> 325.28000000000003
like what the

328.479 --> 333.4
hell

331.24 --> 337.88
no issues with low

333.4 --> 341.59999999999997
fruit keyboard noise yeah whatever okay

337.88 --> 343.88
well yeah let's hope Richard G gets the

341.6 --> 345.84000000000003
stream working on his end but apparently

343.88 --> 349.15999999999997
there's been this whole Crackdown going

345.84 --> 353.35999999999996
around about ad

349.16 --> 356.759
blocks cuz YouTube has done some weird

353.36 --> 359.16
[ __ ] since they changed the ads which is

356.759 --> 361.47900000000004
a few days ago and it's not just us it's

359.16 --> 364.03900000000004
all all over YouTube there's all these

361.479 --> 366.52
like real professional videos now even

364.039 --> 366.52
addressing

366.599 --> 371.039
it so YouTube's like

371.479 --> 377.12
basically cracked down on ad blockers

375.039 --> 380.639
even though they're technically not even

377.12 --> 383.52
allowed to do that weirdly enough

380.639 --> 384.919
legally it's very complicated it's

383.52 --> 386.919
internet

384.919 --> 389.56
complications internet legal

386.919 --> 392.19899999999996
complications basically about what you

389.56 --> 394.44
can do what you can't do privacy

392.199 --> 396.479
versus not

394.44 --> 399.039
privacy

396.479 --> 402.12
but in doing so they've they've

399.039 --> 404.8
literally like ruined a whole bunch of

402.12 --> 404.8
yeah YouTube

405.16 --> 410.28000000000003
users it's like old systems that

407.639 --> 414.0
suddenly don't work where you just have

410.28 --> 415.35999999999996
YouTube as a standard program in a in

414.0 --> 419.0
like a media

415.36 --> 421.28000000000003
machine it's really messing up like a

419.0 --> 424.759
lot of things out there right now so

421.28 --> 427.11999999999995
it's not just us buffering again ah crap

424.759 --> 427.12
hello

445.479 --> 452.24
drer you know this whole blocking thing

448.96 --> 454.71999999999997
people specific people stalling I mean

452.24 --> 457.96000000000004
that would be kind of nice sound weirdly

454.72 --> 460.56
enough if it were actual trolls like

457.96 --> 460.56
provable

462.12 --> 467.199
trolls that were just harassing people

464.84 --> 470.4
like yeah block those

467.199 --> 473.40000000000003
streams to those to those people that

470.4 --> 474.79999999999995
harass those streams that's not even a

473.4 --> 477.4
bad idea to

474.8 --> 481.319
do like because then they'll stop

477.4 --> 481.31899999999996
nagging right

482.159 --> 487.68
if like if you're going to do something

484.039 --> 489.96
weird like that you

487.68 --> 493.24
could I mean they're they're already

489.96 --> 496.0
using all these weird back door tricks

493.24 --> 498.199
and all that all over the place for for

496.0 --> 498.199
a

503.319 --> 508.24
decade you have one gigabyte down yeah

506.039 --> 511.24
love

508.24 --> 512.88
fruit

511.24 --> 515.8
but it it's not about internet

512.88 --> 515.8
connection it's not

523.2 --> 530.839
that moveed timeline to

527.08 --> 533.64
current what

530.839 --> 538.2
okay that's a good thing I

533.64 --> 539.8389999999999
guess all right so yeah YouTube's acting

538.2 --> 541.839
weird

539.839 --> 544.36
they roll out like a new thing and it's

541.839 --> 547.32
screwed up everything

544.36 --> 551.0790000000001
again so that's the most likely the

547.32 --> 554.6400000000001
cause of of this weird stalling with

551.079 --> 554.64
people including

556.88 --> 562.079
yesterday

559.519 --> 565.44
yeah what teret says here in the chat

562.079 --> 568.4799999999999
yeah that is true it's really weird like

565.44 --> 571.12
even afterward specific people can't

568.48 --> 571.12
watch theam

572.76 --> 577.64
I wonder if it would do that if I would

574.92 --> 580.16
like download it and

577.64 --> 583.88
reuploaded if it would do it

580.16 --> 583.88
again it's really

592.36 --> 595.61
[Music]

598.12 --> 601.12

869.44 --> 873.8800000000001
it kind of gave me the Feeling Again of

871.839 --> 876.0
like the time that I got on with

873.88 --> 878.8
Patricia steer in a

876.0 --> 880.72
way she was also just a great

878.8 --> 884.12
interviewer and like would pull things

880.72 --> 886.8000000000001
out of you and you guys kind of did that

884.12 --> 888.759
too and like I have a lot to share like

886.8 --> 891.399
I could have done that technically like

888.759 --> 893.72
for like two more

891.399 --> 897.68
hours you didn't have the time for it

893.72 --> 900.6800000000001
but I mean like I can really keep doing

897.68 --> 900.68
that

901.16 --> 906.279
there's so much and like once you like

904.279 --> 908.0
really get me going with that if you if

906.279 --> 910.24
you can handle it if you don't get

908.0 --> 914.32
exhausted by it then eventually I even

910.24 --> 917.759
start to see like unexpected

914.32 --> 921.399
insights even on top of it all if you

917.759 --> 924.639
just let me keep going long

921.399 --> 925.78

940.199 --> 946.68
win and all that with somebody else

944.079 --> 948.7589999999999

really complicated shamanic event really

1013.399 --> 1020.72
and like I just start referencing it in

1017.519 --> 1025.0
the middle of things at times but I mean

1020.72 --> 1027.24
like nobody I know really it asks me

1025.0 --> 1027.24

like refresh and reload and all that and

it is working eventually so that's

1150.72 --> 1155.64

1153.32 --> 1156.96
that like oh did YouTube just like oh

1155.64 --> 1160.039
we're

1156.96 --> 1162.52
just instead of just Shadow Banning the

1160.039 --> 1166.24
channel from the algorithm so you can

1162.52 --> 1169.72
find them like just Shadow ban the

1166.24 --> 1172.159
followers like the follow can't follow

1169.72 --> 1173.64
anymore like I really thought they were

1172.159 --> 1176.3600000000001
going to do

1173.64 --> 1178.0800000000002
that maybe it is maybe it is like

1176.36 --> 1180.84
temporary I don't know what the hell is

1178.08 --> 1184.48

1397.679 --> 1403.279
it's not the first time weird weird [ __ ]

1400.12 --> 1403.279

yeah I don't know exactly like how it's

1519.12 --> 1524.9189999999999
happening I think it is due to the

1521.96 --> 1527.76
update from YouTube concerning the ad

1524.919 --> 1529.76
lockers things have gone astray since

1527.76 --> 1532.559

is

1731.519 --> 1734.519
lying

1736.399 --> 1739.399
what

1743.44 --> 1746.799
interfere oh

1750.6 --> 1757.799
okay thanks to that low

1754.08 --> 1757.799
fruit Al

1764.679 --> 1773.0
uh the day isn't when RV calls himself a

1769.519 --> 1776.6
sh game I don't get it

1773.0 --> 1779.82
terret I mean RV is just

1776.6 --> 1779.82
[Music]

1783.679 --> 1789.0800000000002
RV like if he's a shield for who is he a

shield

1791.039 --> 1796.32
then I don't get

1793.12 --> 1799.32
it who's he Shilling

1836.44 --> 1840.0
right anyway yeah hopefully there will

1838.44 --> 1842.64
be an fed

1840.0 --> 1844.96
today because Nathan is still having

1842.64 --> 1846.7990000000002
pretty severe comp computer issues that

1844.96 --> 1848.48
as you might have picked up on with this

1846.799 --> 1852.1589999999999
last

1848.48 --> 1854.3600000000001
stream he hasn't exactly uh

1852.159 --> 1859.24
completed the

1854.36 --> 1859.24
uh the fund run that he needed

1859.32 --> 1865.279
which is kind of unfortunate he's like

1861.519 --> 1865.279
he's almost there but not

1865.84 --> 1870.6
there so but he's yeah he said basically

1869.24 --> 1874.65
he was still going to have a stream but

1870.6 --> 1876.519
it might be buggy too it might

1874.65 --> 1881.6390000000001
[Music]

1876.519 --> 1883.28
break who's Nathan are you kidding me Dr

1881.639 --> 1886.1589999999999
utar yeah you

1883.28 --> 1889.1589999999999
[Music]

1886.159 --> 1889.159
are

1892.84 --> 1901.4589999999998
an ad yes Jason McCormack adds are

1897.68 --> 1901.459
[Music]

1902.48 --> 1909.84
on I for told that this day would come

1905.679 --> 1911.799
because what RV think that Nathan is RV

1909.84 --> 1914.559
thinks that everybody's lying and

1911.799 --> 1914.559
scamming

1914.84 --> 1920.9599999999998
like he doesn't have that

1918.6 --> 1924.1589999999999
he's just like that dude dude he's

1920.96 --> 1927.799
called me like all kinds of things he

1924.159 --> 1930.6390000000001
calls PE like he's he's like Ary is kind

1927.799 --> 1931.76
of jittery so he's like he gets nervous

1930.639 --> 1935.0
and then he's

1931.76 --> 1938.0
like this and that it just that's what

1935.0 --> 1940.039
happens he is like a conspiracy he

1938.0 --> 1942.2
almost is kind of like a stereotype

1940.039 --> 1944.399
conspiracy theorist from the movies that

1942.2 --> 1948.3990000000001
if you T put tension on them then

1944.399 --> 1951.1999999999998
suddenly they see all these things

1948.399 --> 1952.799
that are arguably not really there it's

1951.2 --> 1955.799
just

1952.799 --> 1957.72
paranoia so that's what I think with RV

1955.799 --> 1959.32
I I don't really take it that serious

1957.72 --> 1962.1200000000001
like I

1959.32 --> 1964.6789999999999
do I'll hear him out about things but I

1962.12 --> 1966.9189999999999
mean said plenty of things where I'm

1964.679 --> 1969.919
like dude this is just completely

1966.919 --> 1972.519
pointless what you're doing right now so

1969.919 --> 1974.0
it's like I'm not like his biggest fan

1972.519 --> 1979.039
or anything I

1974.0 --> 1979.039
mean I kind of keep track of him a bit

1980.08 --> 1985.84
and I mean I'd rather to be fair I'd

1982.279 --> 1988.96
rather listen to like an RV stream than

1985.84 --> 1991.9599999999998
to like Bev stream or

1988.96 --> 1991.96
something

1992.159 --> 1998.8400000000001
right so when he does things it it it is

1996.2 --> 2001.679
often entertaining and

1998.84 --> 2004.76
informative but I mean RV gets paranoid

2001.679 --> 2004.76
about people very

2005.96 --> 2010.6000000000001
easily he's kind of overly

2011.159 --> 2016.0800000000002
suspicious you've always suspected RV

2016.32 --> 2022.2
yeah but I

2019.559 --> 2025.76
mean he's not doing it because he's like

2022.2 --> 2029.24
a projecting shill or

2025.76 --> 2031.6
anything it's just the way he is it's

2029.24 --> 2034.159
just like with me when you bring up

2031.6 --> 2036.24
really dark [ __ ] subjects that are

2034.159 --> 2038.0
like and then get really Rowdy and angry

2036.24 --> 2042.2
about yeah guess what's going to happen

2038.0 --> 2045.76
I go rage win yeah does that mean that I

2042.2 --> 2048.44
am just universally a freaking Psy

2045.76 --> 2050.96
Psychopathic Maniac or something or does

2048.44 --> 2053.7200000000003
it just mean hey that's the way I

2050.96 --> 2058.28
work that's what happens when you do

2053.72 --> 2060.839
that you know and RV gets like

2058.28 --> 2064.119
suspicious about people to a paranoid

2060.839 --> 2067.399
level it's just what

2064.119 --> 2068.3990000000003
happens it occupies him it

2067.399 --> 2071.7999999999997
gets him

2068.399 --> 2074.56
moving but he also lets things go it's

2071.8 --> 2077.8790000000004
not like oh once he has a suspicion of

2074.56 --> 2079.96
somebody being a shill or something then

2077.879 --> 2081.839
he's never letting it go no that just

2079.96 --> 2085.7200000000003
means he'll actually like try to

2081.839 --> 2085.72
carefully investigate and see if it's

2088.399 --> 2093.56
true it's just when it starts he just

2091.04 --> 2096.2
throws everything at like I have this

2093.56 --> 2100.0
suspicion oh there's a dark conspiracy

2096.2 --> 2102.9199999999996
happening basically like that it's just

2100.0 --> 2105.56
just the way you do

2102.92 --> 2109.96
that and yeah the way I'm saying it is

2105.56 --> 2110.88
not is like exaggerated I mean he's not

2109.96 --> 2114.359
that

2110.88 --> 2117.2000000000003
dumb he not like a cartoon or

2114.359 --> 2120.119
anything so I mean I'm not taking it too

2117.2 --> 2123.1189999999997
serious like and like who cares man like

2120.119 --> 2125.8
if RV thinks that Nathan this like I

2123.119 --> 2128.8
like I don't give a [ __ ]

2125.8 --> 2128.8
dude

2130.96 --> 2136.2
I'm pretty damn sure that like I get to

2133.119 --> 2138.48
see Nathan's face plenty of times I'm

2136.2 --> 2141.7599999999998
pretty sure that he is quite miserable

2138.48 --> 2144.76
about his computer actually being

2141.76 --> 2144.76
broken

2145.359 --> 2150.48
okay and I can tell the difference like

2148.32 --> 2152.76
in the beginning with this computer

2150.48 --> 2155.8
stuff in the tinkering he was really

2152.76 --> 2159.92
confident about it you could tell by his

2155.8 --> 2162.0
face now he's not he's lost that

2159.92 --> 2164.8
confidence he he's not confident but

2162.0 --> 2168.04
he's actually quite miserable about it

2164.8 --> 2171.92
so you miss rage win lately why Dr

2168.04 --> 2175.44
utgard two days ago had a big rage

2171.92 --> 2178.4
win Don't Go full berserk but I went

2175.44 --> 2182.119
Vengeance it's two days

2178.4 --> 2182.119
ago what are you talking

2185.72 --> 2188.72
about

2194.359 --> 2198.0789999999997
right the environmentalism how

2196.28 --> 2202.44
environmentalism was switched for

2198.079 --> 2202.44
Marxist satanic anti-life cult

2203.0 --> 2207.599
cultism I went freaking rage win on that

2205.92 --> 2211.0
stream did you miss

2207.599 --> 2214.7200000000003
that did miss that show due to buffering

2211.0 --> 2219.76
really damn that

2214.72 --> 2222.24
sucks well you could watch it back

2219.76 --> 2224.8
technically I mean I went pretty hard on

2222.24 --> 2224.7999999999997
that show

2227.599 --> 2232.2400000000002
man hard enough to like get a comment

2230.52 --> 2235.079
that seemed kind of genuine of somebody

2232.24 --> 2237.7999999999997
that was like off put by

2235.079 --> 2240.3590000000004
it I thought it was just a gamma troll

2237.8 --> 2242.1600000000003
first but it seemed like no that's

2240.359 --> 2245.5989999999997
probably somebody that just really

2242.16 --> 2247.72
didn't expect to bump into

2245.599 --> 2249.6400000000003
that

2247.72 --> 2252.72
they don't realize that that is kind of

2249.64 --> 2255.96
a part of what I

2252.72 --> 2255.9599999999996
do at

2264.04 --> 2271.2799999999997
times yes low fruit I know

2267.76 --> 2275.2400000000002
that but he's not even been playing the

2271.28 --> 2278.079
games low fruit he turns the game

2275.24 --> 2280.64
on basically basically in the in game

2278.079 --> 2284.8
commits suicide and then just follows

2280.64 --> 2287.5989999999997
other players around because that is

2284.8 --> 2289.6800000000003
just like for rendering wise it's the

2287.599 --> 2292.119
same amount of work for the

2289.68 --> 2295.3999999999996
computer so it's not actually like

2292.119 --> 2297.6800000000003
playing games when he's doing that okay

2295.4 --> 2301.4
he's not the one playing the games he's

2297.68 --> 2302.9199999999996
just following camera following other

2301.4 --> 2305.52
players around that's what you're

2302.92 --> 2308.52
actually looking

2305.52 --> 2308.52
at

2311.319 --> 2315.44
and with Minecraft it's his daughter

2313.16 --> 2315.44
that's

2320.119 --> 2324.8
playing right but I mean he's do he's

2322.56 --> 2327.56
been doing that all the it's just had

2324.8 --> 2330.5600000000004
this attitude of like maximizing all of

2327.56 --> 2330.56
it maximize

2330.599 --> 2336.839
testing even though the computer's not

2333.68 --> 2338.7599999999998
ideal as a setup for that because it's

2336.839 --> 2342.359
been

2338.76 --> 2344.5200000000004
assembled without super super careful

2342.359 --> 2347.4
pre-research of like should you be

2344.52 --> 2350.839
putting all these parts together right

2347.4 --> 2352.96
and that's the problem that Nathan just

2350.839 --> 2356.0789999999997
completely

2352.96 --> 2359.48
overlooked that it was going to keep

2356.079 --> 2362.079
going wrong because of that and and but

2359.48 --> 2365.079
he's got it like in the Stream we had on

2362.079 --> 2367.4
Saturday before ball busters e bagging

2365.079 --> 2370.0
stream I was there with him we talked

2367.4 --> 2371.7200000000003
about it and he got it now like he does

2370.0 --> 2373.56
actually understand what I was talking

2371.72 --> 2375.839
about I've been trying to warn him about

2373.56 --> 2378.04
that at the beginning but he wouldn't

2375.839 --> 2383.24
listen he was just like no I'm going to

2378.04 --> 2383.24
do this like oh okay oh all

2384.2 --> 2391.68
right we'll talk to you later about that

2387.88 --> 2391.6800000000003
and I have now it was

2394.839 --> 2401.04
Saturday BS people stream with yeah no

2398.44 --> 2402.7200000000003
low fruit Nathan has a much more

2401.04 --> 2406.16
professional

2402.72 --> 2410.3999999999996
setup I have a pretty primitive setup as

2406.16 --> 2413.5989999999997
in my sound quality is crap well it's

2410.4 --> 2417.8
doable right but it's crap and Nathan

2413.599 --> 2420.96
has like super high-end sound

2417.8 --> 2423.52
quality with a lot of work to make it

2420.96 --> 2427.359
like that and a lot of managing within

2423.52 --> 2430.7599999999998
the channels to do that his computer

2427.359 --> 2434.2799999999997
just his setup requires more

2430.76 --> 2436.2000000000003
strain like I what he's doing how he's

2434.28 --> 2437.3590000000004
doing it with this setup you can't do

2436.2 --> 2440.5989999999997
that with this

2437.359 --> 2444.119
computer okay you can't do that but what

2440.599 --> 2444.119
you can do with this computer

2444.4 --> 2451.839
is like do the OBS have a YouTube open

2449.28 --> 2454.5600000000004
maybe do a caller whatever even have a

2451.839 --> 2455.319
game playing in the background and

2454.56 --> 2457.44
that's

2455.319 --> 2459.56
it

2457.44 --> 2463.96
on a on a very small

2459.56 --> 2467.64
screen no overclocking

2463.96 --> 2470.68
nothing and yeah that

2467.64 --> 2475.2799999999997
works but I mean Nathan is running more

2470.68 --> 2475.2799999999997
heavy equipment as in heavier

2477.56 --> 2482.72
software and my computer has like been

2480.92 --> 2485.2400000000002
pretty carefully

2482.72 --> 2487.56
assembled it's like an it was based on

2485.24 --> 2490.4799999999996
an old very tested system and even like

2487.56 --> 2493.359
the motherboard replacement is a very

2490.48 --> 2495.079
good type it it worked out really well

2493.359 --> 2497.2
oh it worked out really well which is a

2495.079 --> 2499.6800000000003
miracle to me

2497.2 --> 2501.8799999999997
because I didn't expect it just the

2499.68 --> 2504.04
computer to basically like have a body

2501.88 --> 2507.8
transplant and

2504.04 --> 2507.8
then like continue

2508.88 --> 2518.2400000000002
working oh damn it I'm having stalling

2513.0 --> 2518.24
now was it one time hm

2521.16 --> 2527.7999999999997
so in a way I've been lucky and I've

2524.44 --> 2531.96
been very careful very

2527.8 --> 2535.88
modest Nathan just went for it

2531.96 --> 2538.0
overestimated or underestimated like the

2535.88 --> 2540.52
complications that

2538.0 --> 2542.24
happen that you don't get to see when

2540.52 --> 2545.28
you're still doing the

2542.24 --> 2547.839
tinkering right it's just tinkering is

2545.28 --> 2550.3590000000004
not straightforward and I learned this

2547.839 --> 2553.04
like a decade ago from a

2550.359 --> 2556.2799999999997
guy that is like a professional

2553.04 --> 2559.599
programmer or like systems the jezuit

2556.28 --> 2561.3190000000004
guy yeah he's like programmer and he's

2559.599 --> 2564.319
told me that like yeah tinkering

2561.319 --> 2566.48
tinkering oh that's cute he's seen

2564.319 --> 2568.04
plenty of people break their computers

2566.48 --> 2571.4
because of

2568.04 --> 2574.68
tinkering and that's they got it from

2571.4 --> 2577.44
him I've never done that it's thanks to

2574.68 --> 2579.7599999999998
him I'm like yeah

2577.44 --> 2582.04
that sounds perfect thank you for the

2579.76 --> 2583.96
good advice I'm never doing that and I

2582.04 --> 2587.02
haven't done it ever since and I've

2583.96 --> 2588.7200000000003
never had my computers

2587.02 --> 2591.48
[Music]

2588.72 --> 2593.16
breaking except for yeah just being worn

2591.48 --> 2596.16
from old

2593.16 --> 2596.16
age

2597.359 --> 2601.5989999999997
so F Mega amounts of money yeah well

2600.0 --> 2603.76
that's what you get when you go for

2601.599 --> 2605.76
super highend if you go for the big

2603.76 --> 2606.76
stuff it's more expensive if you pick

2605.76 --> 2611.4
for

2606.76 --> 2614.96
like oh I want the most developed

2611.4 --> 2617.52
cards that are like almost

2614.96 --> 2620.92
outdated but they've like picked in

2617.52 --> 2622.52
their updating like they've been managed

2620.92 --> 2625.88
so that like all the bugs have been

2622.52 --> 2627.599
smooth out but it's like old because

2625.88 --> 2630.52
there's all this newer stuff oh it's

2627.599 --> 2631.76
more faster yeah and I'm like oh give me

2630.52 --> 2635.079
like your

2631.76 --> 2637.3590000000004
oldest least overclocked piece of

2635.079 --> 2640.2000000000003
hardware and that's usually the one I

2637.359 --> 2642.7999999999997
pick that's how I pick my graphics card

2640.2 --> 2646.1189999999997
this graphics card doesn't have a fan on

2642.8 --> 2649.28
it yeah but it's

2646.119 --> 2652.4
fantastic it's

2649.28 --> 2655.119
fantastic this thing is 10 years old and

2652.4 --> 2659.2400000000002
it doesn't it doesn't

2655.119 --> 2662.359
break it doesn't even have a fan on it

2659.24 --> 2665.0
on the graphics card okay guys that's

2662.359 --> 2666.72
how I picked my

2665.0 --> 2668.599
Hardware

2666.72 --> 2671.5589999999997
can you believe it that that Graphics

2668.599 --> 2671.559
card's 10 years

2682.72 --> 2689.24
old his old system was B better yeah

2686.119 --> 2691.76
well to be fair he should probably if he

2689.24 --> 2694.0
could somehow get his old system back

2691.76 --> 2696.88
back but I mean Nathan is like really

2694.0 --> 2698.88
aiming at this point for a complete re

2696.88 --> 2700.88
Arrangement where he's going to do what

2698.88 --> 2703.839
I tried to advise him like half a year

2700.88 --> 2706.2000000000003
ago like water cooled computer no no no

2703.839 --> 2708.359
I have this fanless oh I'm putting this

2706.2 --> 2712.359
fan in in these I need my fans in the

2708.359 --> 2712.359
fanless system like water

2712.68 --> 2719.52
cooling well M he's actually going to

2715.319 --> 2722.079
freaking do it now the next step is like

2719.52 --> 2724.44
replace the entire casing and get a

2722.079 --> 2726.52
proper water cool system which like

2724.44 --> 2730.04
that's exactly what you need when you

2726.52 --> 2733.44
have a super high-end system that's like

2730.04 --> 2736.64
really heavy a heavy computer yeah you

2733.44 --> 2739.079
need that then so he's he's finally

2736.64 --> 2742.92
switched his mind to that and if he'd

2739.079 --> 2742.92
only done that like half a year

2753.44 --> 2757.88
ago okay George Sanford

2769.68 --> 2775.8799999999997
maybe it's not going liquid cold still

2773.839 --> 2777.88
no but that because that's a giant

2775.88 --> 2780.96
investment low

2777.88 --> 2782.96
fruit you can like he's just got to try

2780.96 --> 2784.8
he's trying to keep his stuff working as

2782.96 --> 2787.8
it is

2784.8 --> 2787.8
now

2788.76 --> 2797.4390000000003
[Music]

2804.31 --> 2811.869
[Music]

2817.559 --> 2823.1600000000003
all right but yeah hopefully it'll just

2820.72 --> 2824.7999999999997
stay stable for a while and eventually

2823.16 --> 2827.0789999999997
it's probably going to have to go to

2824.8 --> 2827.079
water

2827.599 --> 2835.28
cooler water water cooled computer

2831.68 --> 2838.0
system okay let's see let's see how the

2835.28 --> 2838.0
freaking ads

2841.8 --> 2847.7200000000003
are

2844.72 --> 2847.72
uh

2849.28 --> 2851.599
where is

2869.72 --> 2874.16
it

2871.48 --> 2877.16
yeah every yeah it's set to every 30

2874.16 --> 2880.48
minutes uh

2877.16 --> 2884.04
Jason that's just how the ads are

2880.48 --> 2889.359
set if I let YouTube do it then like you

2884.04 --> 2889.359
get the really [ __ ] long ads too

2896.839 --> 2900.92
so okay Jason yeah see you

2902.68 --> 2908.1189999999997
later I is suffering because of lack of

2905.4 --> 2912.559
con consistency not just

2908.119 --> 2914.559
that Templar KN baits it's also that

2912.559 --> 2917.2000000000003
it's the season and there's a lot of

2914.559 --> 2920.599
people that like a lot of panelists are

2917.2 --> 2922.319
just like they're suddenly like finding

2920.599 --> 2925.3590000000004
themselves in spots where they just

2922.319 --> 2929.7599999999998
can't do the show anymore it's like all

2925.359 --> 2929.7599999999998
simultaneous as well

2934.599 --> 2937.599
weird

2940.68 --> 2946.9199999999996
yeah low fruit that's cool but you see

2943.4 --> 2949.599
plumbers is actually a profession that

2946.92 --> 2952.839
where you really always have work always

2949.599 --> 2955.2400000000002
have income yeah professional streamer

2952.839 --> 2957.5589999999997
you got to be kidding me if you're a

2955.24 --> 2960.64
professional streamer of any kind you're

2957.559 --> 2964.3590000000004
going to be dependent on

2960.64 --> 2967.04
donations cuz the entire thing and like

2964.359 --> 2969.0789999999997
YouTube and Google and they all just

2967.04 --> 2972.079
[ __ ] you

2969.079 --> 2975.88
up they all just [ __ ] [ __ ] you up

2972.079 --> 2978.7200000000003
with political nagging and Strikes and

2975.88 --> 2978.7200000000003
crap and

2979.839 --> 2985.359
like it's not fair to compare it to

2982.44 --> 2987.64
Plumbing okay low fruit that's really

2985.359 --> 2987.64
not

2994.52 --> 2997.52
fair

3000.54 --> 3004.02
[Music]

3014.71 --> 3019.76
[Music]

3021.359 --> 3023.88
all right

3024.44 --> 3031.44
anyway hopefully he'll just work out

3027.96 --> 3035.2400000000002
and keep the support coming and all

3031.44 --> 3038.16
that and yeah Nathan's computer I mean

3035.24 --> 3040.319
at least I out of all of it I think that

3038.16 --> 3043.1189999999997
at least he's just learning

3040.319 --> 3046.24
lessons he is a very smart guy and he

3043.119 --> 3048.839
kind of like rolled into

3046.24 --> 3051.2799999999997
this I'm just kind of sad he didn't

3048.839 --> 3054.2799999999997
actually listen to me at the beginning

3051.28 --> 3056.6800000000003
because I was not messing with him I was

3054.28 --> 3059.1600000000003
just like no

3056.68 --> 3060.9199999999996
tinkering remember that remember me in

3059.16 --> 3065.04
the beginning like this is not going to

3060.92 --> 3065.04
go well this is not

3066.48 --> 3069.88
dude but

3070.76 --> 3077.96
yeah at least he's got that now at least

3074.04 --> 3080.72
he he understands like yeah

3077.96 --> 3082.2400000000002
tinkering tinkering is like gambling you

3080.72 --> 3084.64
think you're just going to get that big

3082.24 --> 3087.64
score and then you never get the big

3084.64 --> 3087.64
score and are

3102.72 --> 3108.319
poor but I mean yeah he can get his

3105.28 --> 3111.44
computer to work at least and we'll see

3108.319 --> 3113.92
where it all goes hopefully he will

3111.44 --> 3116.799
event like he's going to drop the

3113.92 --> 3118.799
[ __ ] tinkering

3116.799 --> 3122.16
well like set it to how it's supposed to

3118.799 --> 3123.799
be and then like stop [ __ ] around

3122.16 --> 3126.5589999999997
with

3123.799 --> 3128.319
it and do what needs to be done so he's

3126.559 --> 3130.96
probably going to have to get that water

3128.319 --> 3130.96
cooler in

3131.2 --> 3134.2
there

3135.839 --> 3141.839
eventually not watching fed this channel

3138.68 --> 3141.839
rules oh okay Dr

3144.28 --> 3148.88
utar

3147.16 --> 3150.3999999999996
thank you for

3148.88 --> 3153.28
[Music]

3150.4 --> 3156.48
that I hope that expresses itself in

3153.28 --> 3156.48
actual financial support

3157.359 --> 3163.2
too but uh yeah I appreciate that

3160.52 --> 3165.359
although look I wouldn't really know

3163.2 --> 3167.7599999999998
what to do if there wasn't any if there

3165.359 --> 3167.7599999999998
wasn't

3169.92 --> 3177.2400000000002
fed like I can't do on my show what I

3173.44 --> 3177.2400000000002
can do on fed you see

3185.64 --> 3191.0
and I've learned so much there and I

3188.16 --> 3193.5989999999997
still do it's like fed to me is like

3191.0 --> 3195.88
going the school or going to the

3193.599 --> 3198.079
university it feels almost like I'm a

3195.88 --> 3200.6400000000003
teacher there I'm like yeah I'm going to

3198.079 --> 3203.799
the university again it's like yeah the

3200.64 --> 3205.72
rest of the teachers and students and

3203.799 --> 3207.7599999999998
numpties and

3205.72 --> 3210.4399999999996
it's like the best university ever you

3207.76 --> 3212.559
can literally just yell at idiots and

3210.44 --> 3214.76
call them numpty [ __ ] and that's

3212.559 --> 3217.079
like expected of you as a teacher I mean

3214.76 --> 3217.079
it's

3220.92 --> 3227.88
[Music]

3223.799 --> 3233.839
awesome right and I think I do my

3227.88 --> 3233.839
best as a teacher in in fed

3234.16 --> 3239.0
University never liked school I liked

3244.88 --> 3248.44
school I did like

3249.28 --> 3253.9
[Music]

3257.4 --> 3263.96
School same show basically everyday fed

3261.76 --> 3267.28
well hey people say that about my stuff

3263.96 --> 3270.599
too I mean it's literally just hey

3267.28 --> 3272.44
there's this guy Arwin with a bow in the

3270.599 --> 3275.52
background and people keep asking is

3272.44 --> 3279.48
that a crossbow remember that one

3275.52 --> 3281.599
right and it's just me in this Stone Arc

3279.48 --> 3284.839
with the background going day and night

3281.599 --> 3287.44
in the chat and it's like that every

3284.839 --> 3290.0
single time I think that a lot of people

3287.44 --> 3291.119
actually feel that way about my show and

3290.0 --> 3294.76
not

3291.119 --> 3297.92
fed cuz in fed there's at least like

3294.76 --> 3300.88
random people getting on there and new

3297.92 --> 3304.0
newcomers like sharing their stories and

3300.88 --> 3307.0
and new Ballers getting into a

3304.0 --> 3307.0
hassle

3309.48 --> 3314.079
so it's just the one thing that is

3312.359 --> 3316.48
definitely always the same is it's

3314.079 --> 3318.2400000000002
always just flat earth flat earth flat

3316.48 --> 3322.839
earth flat Earth arguments you're going

3318.24 --> 3325.72
to need a flat Earth for that right yeah

3322.839 --> 3329.5589999999997
that part is definitely kind of

3325.72 --> 3329.5589999999997
repetitive but yeah that's

3332.039 --> 3339.559
dude it's flat Earth debate

3336.28 --> 3341.799
like I think it's admirable that it is

3339.559 --> 3343.48
holding on to actually being about Flat

3341.799 --> 3346.0
Earth even though that yeah makes it a

3343.48 --> 3349.4
little monotonous in a

3346.0 --> 3351.599
way but I mean it's very functional I'm

3349.4 --> 3353.2400000000002

on or something was it a baller I think

3404.2 --> 3410.3999999999996

don't get Ballers anti flat earthers

3410.4 --> 3417.96
rolling in the Discord as much as we

3413.079 --> 3421.079

3417.96 --> 3423.7200000000003
couple of years ago like we we could

3421.079 --> 3426.88
barely hold the anti flat earthers out

3423.72 --> 3430.0789999999997
of the chat out of the

3426.88 --> 3433.039
Discord but they've all just kind of

3430.079 --> 3434.76
like they've all digested and like

3433.039 --> 3436.6400000000003
withered they're all weakened so they

3434.76 --> 3439.119
just don't really come back because they

3436.64 --> 3441.4
know like there's no chance in hell that

3439.119 --> 3443.799
they can win any argument in there there

3441.4 --> 3445.4
just no chance so they don't really come

stream you can watch

3519.24 --> 3524.24
that gold spring screen yeah yeah that's

3532.72 --> 3538.68
there so yeah I do

3536.079 --> 3540.079
like I don't just want to be alone on

3538.68 --> 3543.0389999999998
the internet

3540.079 --> 3544.599
right but I got to find the right people

3543.039 --> 3546.28
and I'm not just going to like oh I'm

3544.599 --> 3548.4
going to go around the corner and bump

3546.28 --> 3551.8390000000004
into somebody random like hey somebody

3548.4 --> 3554.839

mark sergeant of this corner of the

3569.839 --> 3573.68
internet or something because everybody

3572.48 --> 3576.28
knows Mark

3573.68 --> 3579.799
sarden right and I feel like everybody

3576.28 --> 3579.799
knows me too when I go

3581.44 --> 3586.28
around so I could just do a little bit

3583.88 --> 3586.28
more of

3590.559 --> 3596.88
that right and spread some good stuff

3593.839 --> 3599.24

I mean CC Chris is like one of those

3809.44 --> 3815.559
he's like the neighbor

3812.76 --> 3818.6400000000003

3818.64 --> 3823.16
of

3820.16 --> 3823.16

right I mean you could just see it

3826.24 --> 3831.16
happen that somebody like oh I'm so

3838.079 --> 3841.079

right cuz I don't know CC Chris is like

3853.119 --> 3857.44
one of those guys that can

3855.16 --> 3860.5589999999997
metaphorically not

3857.44 --> 3862.559
literally it's just like like a dog that

3860.559 --> 3865.6800000000003
can be entertained by running after its

3862.559 --> 3867.039
own tail and be perfectly okay with that

3865.68 --> 3870.64
and not feel

3867.039 --> 3873.279
stupid just like yay and Chris is like

3870.64 --> 3877.799
yeah you can just always just

3873.279 --> 3878.76
find funny things and enjoyable things

3877.799 --> 3881.96
little

3878.76 --> 3883.96
things he's like a Simpsons neighbor H

3881.96 --> 3887.079
that's funny that's a good

3883.96 --> 3890.88
one yeah he would make a great Simpsons

3887.079 --> 3893.48
neighbor character

3890.88 --> 3897.88
actually I would laugh my ass off if I

3893.48 --> 3900.88
noticed like a CC Chris neighbor in in

3897.88 --> 3900.88
Simpsons all of a

3902.72 --> 3907.799
sudden your dog is doing that right now

3905.4 --> 3912.2400000000002
oh okay

3907.799 --> 3912.24
clutch his hair is ready for yeah

3914.32 --> 3922.3590000000004
[Music]

3920.039 --> 3924.2000000000003
exactly and I mean he would be like a

3922.359 --> 3925.88
character that could always like in the

3924.2 --> 3929.359
background be saying like what look at

3925.88 --> 3933.44
that balloon what is that a sad aloon

3929.359 --> 3935.68
like he'd be that guy

3933.44 --> 3939.2000000000003
right like he's just yelling in the

3935.68 --> 3939.2
background nobody's listening to

3941.16 --> 3946.7599999999998
him thought you got to be kidding me are

3943.88 --> 3950.559
nobody's picking up on

3946.76 --> 3950.559
this just hear him in the

3953.079 --> 3956.079
background

3963.24 --> 3968.2
if you have CCE as a neighbor you know

3965.76 --> 3971.4
you have been locked up

3968.2 --> 3974.0789999999997
what okay this getting a bit

3971.4 --> 3975.52
dark so you're saying like he would be

3974.079 --> 3979.279
like

3975.52 --> 3983.0
the the dystopic future

3979.279 --> 3985.72
neighbor remember that that super dark

3983.0 --> 3987.2
clip

3985.72 --> 3990.2
this is getting really weird but

3987.2 --> 3991.839
remember like this that weird video 3D

3990.2 --> 3995.48
animated video of the guy that's

3991.839 --> 3997.72
basically going to like a isolation

3995.48 --> 4001.039
house with

3997.72 --> 4003.24
like social credit RAC and you get

4001.039 --> 4005.7200000000003
nothing but you get a free suicide and

4003.24 --> 4008.5589999999997
then they see a neighbor oh takes this

4005.72 --> 4011.68
special medicine and then they get

4008.559 --> 4014.6400000000003
lifted off by a robot well he would be a

4011.68 --> 4017.5589999999997
neighbor in that and he would still be

4014.64 --> 4018.92
scary like still like yeah no we can't

4017.559 --> 4021.52
give

4018.92 --> 4022.48
up and just let's talk about Flat Earth

4021.52 --> 4024.68
or

4022.48 --> 4026.599
something it's kind of dark to think

4024.68 --> 4029.52
about but I

4026.599 --> 4032.319
mean that would be kind of

4029.52 --> 4035.72
weird find yourself in a

4032.319 --> 4039.079
dystopic eat Z bug's future house with

4035.72 --> 4040.52
robots guarding you all the time but you

4039.079 --> 4043.2400000000002
can't see your neighbors and then it's

4040.52 --> 4045.0
like hey it's Chris it's there hey

4043.24 --> 4049.4399999999996
neighbor

4045.0 --> 4052.72

4061.359 --> 4067.92

4063.559 --> 4067.92

4069.359 --> 4074.88
combination yeah and by the way CC Chris

4441.32 --> 4446.48
it's kind of weird you know looking

4443.28 --> 4451.4
through the block list it's almost like

4446.48 --> 4454.0
I'm just looking at souls in hell like

4451.4 --> 4455.679
are you supposed to be there or are you

4454.0 --> 4458.56
not supposed to be

4455.679 --> 4461.4
there right so I'm like bumping into zap

4458.56 --> 4465.76
tapy a lot now it's like nope no you

4461.4 --> 4465.759999999999
just you just burn there for a

4472.08 --> 4477.6
while but AGM like what the hell is he

4475.12 --> 4477.599999999999
doing in

4478.88 --> 4482.88
there might have just overlooked him

4481.08 --> 4485.96
early I don't think that like people are

4482.88 --> 4488.679
getting like Shadow blocked

4485.96 --> 4490.96
anymore I think the the great unbanning

4488.679 --> 4494.36
really did do it it might have been all

4490.96 --> 4496.76
oz in the end

4494.36 --> 4498.719
but I mean I literally at this point

4496.76 --> 4502.52
suspect others of you too which I'm just

4498.719 --> 4502.52
not going to get into at

4506.52 --> 4511.52
all I'm just going to keep things the

4509.36 --> 4513.599999999999
way they are right now because I think

4511.52 --> 4516.0
it's a pretty good setup except for the

4513.6 --> 4518.84
freaking stalling and all that but I

4516.0 --> 4521.239
mean it's probably not related that

4518.84 --> 4521.2390000000005
would be

4522.199 --> 4527.96
weird

4524.159 --> 4527.96
right so yeah seems to be

4534.59 --> 4541.1900000000005
[Music]

4549.56 --> 4556.120000000001
clean was O doing

4552.199 --> 4559.36
that well he was an infiltrator and he

4556.12 --> 4561.32
was obviously abusing his

4559.36 --> 4563.28
wrench Dr

4561.32 --> 4568.799999999999
[Music]

4563.28 --> 4568.8
utr ever played 4 out 4

4570.96 --> 4578.84
no uh that sounds like it's a 3D shooter

4575.36 --> 4578.839999999999
type thing I'm not playing

4582.12 --> 4585.599999999999
those

4583.76 --> 4588.6
I've heard good things about it though

4585.6 --> 4590.400000000001
that name that franchise but I'm like I

4588.6 --> 4592.679
can't play that it's like yeah it's the

4590.4 --> 4595.28
best that it makes me sick though but I

4592.679 --> 4598.12
mean I I've heard great things about it

4595.28 --> 4602.719
you know I just can't I don't play

4598.12 --> 4602.719
3D shooter type games anymore I just

4605.56 --> 4610.76
don't it's decis yeah but I like I could

4608.6 --> 4612.52
try to play it I would just end up

4610.76 --> 4613.76
getting sick again I just don't want to

4612.52 --> 4615.56
do that

4613.76 --> 4618.08
you

4615.56 --> 4620.0
know I mean I I even have that same

4618.08 --> 4622.0
issue if I'm going to watch somebody

4620.0 --> 4624.199
else play it I mean if I even have it

4622.0 --> 4626.44
when I watch somebody else play it like

4624.199 --> 4628.96
there's no point there's no point in

4626.44 --> 4628.96
trying

4634.96 --> 4641.08
really I just can't do that it's not in

4637.96 --> 4644.28
me like I can play strategy games like

4641.08 --> 4646.76
top down View and and even third person

4644.28 --> 4649.159
games where it's not really like oh

4646.76 --> 4651.12
reflex no when it's just like oh you're

4649.159 --> 4655.04
walking around with a character and

4651.12 --> 4657.04
clicking on somebody like oh that's fine

4655.04 --> 4659.88
because the camera is not like you don't

4657.04 --> 4663.199
have to like reflex move around if you

4659.88 --> 4665.0
have to reflex move around in the 3D

4663.199 --> 4667.5599999999995
that makes me

4665.0 --> 4669.92
sick does not make me sick in the real

4667.56 --> 4673.280000000001
world though but it does when I have to

4669.92 --> 4675.2390000000005
like adapt that instinct to the 3dp iion

4673.28 --> 4677.44
of disbelief it literally starts making

4675.239 --> 4677.44
me

4680.239 --> 4686.599999999999
ill can't play it for the same reason ah

4683.639 --> 4689.2390000000005
yeah exactly yeah and the Oculus makes

4686.6 --> 4689.2390000000005
it even

4689.8 --> 4696.76
worse I mean it's such a waste that that

4694.08 --> 4699.32
even that it is like that because it's

4696.76 --> 4701.719
like I wish I would have been like yeah

4699.32 --> 4705.199
I'm the

4701.719 --> 4708.04
Cyberman like oh techno music oh I'm in

4705.199 --> 4710.129999999999
the 3D I can't do it I I literally

4708.04 --> 4712.199
become

4710.13 --> 4716.4800000000005
[Music]

4712.199 --> 4719.159
sick man I when I was like a teen I was

4716.48 --> 4721.718999999999
dreaming of like virt I was dreaming of

4719.159 --> 4725.44
like the lawnmower man thing right

4721.719 --> 4726.52
remember that silly movie Stephen King

4725.44 --> 4729.5199999999995
movie

4726.52 --> 4733.1990000000005
actually it's like oh

4729.52 --> 4735.96
floating flying what and [ __ ] yeah of

4733.199 --> 4737.919999999999
course and [ __ ] we're nerds what you

4735.96 --> 4741.719
think that's strange or something like

4737.92 --> 4743.88
welcome to the future but I mean yeah I

4741.719 --> 4745.8
thought like oh man that's so awesome oh

4743.88 --> 4749.32
that's a future and then it's like yeah

4745.8 --> 4751.320000000001
3D makes you sick

4749.32 --> 4753.96
oh

4751.32 --> 4757.239
okay and it's not like oh it's because

4753.96 --> 4759.84
you got old Arwin no I got sick from

4757.239 --> 4764.0
that at a very young age it's just

4759.84 --> 4765.04
that like excess amounts of sugar and

4764.0 --> 4768.639
like

4765.04 --> 4772.84
fanatical like inflamed Obsession and

4768.639 --> 4775.28
like yeah kind of like pushed the sick

4772.84 --> 4778.1990000000005
away it's just that the enthusiasm just

4775.28 --> 4781.28
kind of like didn't make me notice that

4778.199 --> 4783.678999999999
I got sick from 3D when I was younger I

4781.28 --> 4786.719
was just so OD by it so impressed so

4783.679 --> 4789.88
enthusi that I just couldn't

4786.719 --> 4791.84
but when I just like got past my teens I

4789.88 --> 4795.04
just started to notice

4791.84 --> 4797.360000000001
like huh I feel kind of queasy why is

4795.04 --> 4800.84
that that's weird cuz I'm not eating

4797.36 --> 4803.679
dirty chips or something like what is

4800.84 --> 4805.4800000000005
this like when I and then like

4803.679 --> 4808.92
eventually when I started playing like

4805.48 --> 4813.28
half lifee 2 that's when it really hit

4808.92 --> 4816.8
me that is like then because it was such

4813.28 --> 4820.44
realistic 3D it was scary realistic

4816.8 --> 4823.08
looking 3D and it was a scary dystopic

4820.44 --> 4825.5199999999995
game too when I was playing it was like

4823.08 --> 4827.5199999999995
so real and then eventually I like after

4825.52 --> 4832.120000000001
half an hour I just know it's

4827.52 --> 4835.4800000000005
like and I had to run to the toilet and

4832.12 --> 4837.199
like throw up nothing comes out it's

4835.48 --> 4840.638999999999
like

4837.199 --> 4844.638999999999
ah like whoa this is really wrong like a

4840.639 --> 4848.32
super bad strain on your body is

4844.639 --> 4850.639
like like yeah just then I was like yeah

4848.32 --> 4852.4
[ __ ] that game I threw it off my

4850.639 --> 4854.76
computer never touched it again it's

4852.4 --> 4856.759999999999
like I'm never doing that again I'm just

4854.76 --> 4861.8
going to play

4856.76 --> 4864.56
3D strategy type games and no more first

4861.8 --> 4867.0
person the only first person game I ever

4864.56 --> 4869.92
played after that was

4867.0 --> 4872.88
Skyrim because Skyrim is just so

4869.92 --> 4876.04
freaking beautiful that I kind of and

4872.88 --> 4879.08
there's no time limit or anything

4876.04 --> 4881.199
so I just used it to like okay play a

4879.08 --> 4883.199
bit and then just like stand still and

4881.199 --> 4885.28
just look at the landscape for a bit

4883.199 --> 4886.36
just like oh wow look at look at that

4885.28 --> 4890.28
wow what's

4886.36 --> 4893.44
that so it's not like reflex oh it's a

4890.28 --> 4896.88
monster at every corner like and then I

4893.44 --> 4896.879999999999
wouldn't really get sick from

4897.56 --> 4903.88
it if it just didn't jerk around

4900.56 --> 4906.159000000001
paranoid all the time in the 3D and then

4903.88 --> 4909.0
I wouldn't get sick so a Skyrim I could

4906.159 --> 4911.638999999999
play but that's like the last first

4909.0 --> 4914.639
person 3D game that I

4911.639 --> 4914.639
played

4922.76 --> 4929.360000000001
yeah I did actually try like the VR

4925.8 --> 4930.6
headset friend headed from what you said

4929.36 --> 4934.32
uh the

4930.6 --> 4936.88
Oculus the resolution on that thing was

4934.32 --> 4939.32
horrendous but that was the worst

4936.88 --> 4942.84
problem was that there was a motion

4939.32 --> 4945.44
delay I mean it literally make you feel

4942.84 --> 4947.08
like you had a massive hangover like

4945.44 --> 4949.48
really

4947.08 --> 4951.0
[ __ ] couldn't have that thing on

4949.48 --> 4953.48
longer than 2

4951.0 --> 4957.44
minutes without getting

4953.48 --> 4960.36
sick cuz it's like you

4957.44 --> 4962.759999999999
move like [ __ ] you what the hell is this

4960.36 --> 4964.199
delay you're moving it's supposed to

4962.76 --> 4965.77
immediately

4964.199 --> 4971.5289999999995
move the

4965.77 --> 4971.529
[Music]

4971.56 --> 4974.56
hell

4976.84 --> 4984.32
yeah the dragons in Skyrim

4979.239 --> 4984.32
yeah it's awesome game it was very

4989.199 --> 4994.96
impressive it's also technically like

4991.639 --> 5000.2390000000005
the last game I actually

4994.96 --> 5000.2390000000005
bought on this I still have

5000.679 --> 5006.88
it no that's not true I did buy Diablo 3

5004.4 --> 5006.879999999999
that came

5010.19 --> 5016.32
[Music]

5013.32 --> 5019.92
after right but it was a good game very

5016.32 --> 5019.92
beautiful very very

5021.32 --> 5027.04
[Music]

5024.679 --> 5029.32
beautiful and it was a piece of art

5027.04 --> 5032.08
because it was like more beautiful than

5029.32 --> 5034.599999999999
it should be logically capable of being

5032.08 --> 5038.4
and that's always amazing when that

5034.6 --> 5038.400000000001
happens when they just

5039.08 --> 5044.08
like you could say probably that Skyrim

5041.639 --> 5046.719
inways is better 3D than even some

5044.08 --> 5051.639
Modern games have

5046.719 --> 5055.4800000000005
because it did its best to really look

5051.639 --> 5058.88
real with little so it's like really

5055.48 --> 5062.759999999999
effective Stage Theater theater stage

5058.88 --> 5064.719
working it was it was like super B basic

5062.76 --> 5067.88
props actually when you think about

5064.719 --> 5070.4
actually study Skyrim but it worked so

5067.88 --> 5074.400000000001
well because it had just been arranged

5070.4 --> 5078.12
together so carefully

5074.4 --> 5080.28
perfect right if you look up close it's

5078.12 --> 5083.36
like wow it's actually kind of simple

5080.28 --> 5086.639
they they just did a fantastic job with

5083.36 --> 5089.5199999999995
relatively simple measures and that's

5086.639 --> 5092.0
that's like real good

5089.52 --> 5093.400000000001
programming so it was a very impressive

5092.0 --> 5097.239
game

5093.4 --> 5099.48
and properly got Fame for it it properly

5097.239 --> 5100.32
got Fame it was a very famous game when

5099.48 --> 5104.32
it came

5100.32 --> 5104.32
out and it deserved that

5111.36 --> 5117.28
absolutely right and hey I played it on

5114.639 --> 5119.56
my then brand new computer that I had

5117.28 --> 5119.5599999999995
just

5120.04 --> 5123.84
assembled and it's basically still the

5122.4 --> 5125.32
same computer the only thing that's

5123.84 --> 5127.96
changed is it it has a different

5125.32 --> 5130.599999999999
motherboard it's the same graphics card

5127.96 --> 5132.719
that I bought back then you could even

5130.6 --> 5133.88
argue I kind of bought the new computer

5132.719 --> 5138.4
for

5133.88 --> 5140.92
Skyrim the old one was getting old like

5138.4 --> 5143.5599999999995
like not playing the newer games anymore

5140.92 --> 5145.639
and even which are already old now but

5143.56 --> 5148.360000000001
like only playing like really old stuff

5145.639 --> 5150.88
and it's like I need I need to upgrade

5148.36 --> 5152.599999999999
and I did it then and it's like great

5150.88 --> 5154.2390000000005
great decision at like one of of the

5152.6 --> 5157.84
best

5154.239 --> 5161.239
assembles like the assemble from 2010

5157.84 --> 5165.6
from tweakers.net for gaming computer

5161.239 --> 5168.32
and it was like the best ever I mean

5165.6 --> 5171.2390000000005
they those guys really know what they're

5168.32 --> 5174.119
doing like I'm not going to like ever

5171.239 --> 5176.919999999999
even try to get a computer if it's not

5174.119 --> 5179.839999999999
like an recommended setup from Tweakers

5176.92 --> 5179.84
I'm just not going to do

5181.199 --> 5184.199
it

5188.0 --> 5193.6
all right

5190.6 --> 5193.6
anyhow

5203.04 --> 5209.639
H okay so I think that Nathan said the

5207.56 --> 5213.360000000001
the show that we did

5209.639 --> 5216.56
Saturday that I on that by the way

5213.36 --> 5219.719
me Nathan and qwi had a sort of like a

5216.56 --> 5221.679
GPU won as they call it Saturday I think

5219.719 --> 5225.8
that he's premiering

5221.679 --> 5228.4400000000005
that in 8 minutes from now instead of

5225.8 --> 5228.4400000000005
doing a live

5230.83 --> 5238.35
[Music]

5239.4 --> 5246.32
stream don't buy A40 90 I have no idea

5244.0 --> 5246.32
what that

5248.36 --> 5253.679
is wow look at all this light all

5250.84 --> 5256.8
suddenly coming in just

5253.679 --> 5259.4400000000005
what look at how that changed remember

5256.8 --> 5263.08
at the start the

5259.44 --> 5267.5599999999995
show one and a half hours

5263.08 --> 5267.5599999999995
ago now looks completely different

5268.28 --> 5273.08
now this sky looks really

5271.119 --> 5276.0
blue up

5273.08 --> 5278.28
there look at how fast it's moving see

5276.0 --> 5279.48
you can literally see the cloud moving

5278.28 --> 5282.32
into

5279.48 --> 5287.32
frame

5282.32 --> 5287.32
wow wind is blowing pretty hard up

5289.44 --> 5293.638999999999
there RTX video

5294.159 --> 5298.839999999999
card I don't even know that sort of

5301.04 --> 5304.04
stuff

5310.639 --> 5316.04
right but the point is I'm not buying

5312.84 --> 5318.88
anything anytime soon I'd love to buy a

5316.04 --> 5322.04
whole new computer guys if you're if

5318.88 --> 5324.28
you're okay with that and then when I am

5322.04 --> 5326.119
going to assemble that new computer if I

5324.28 --> 5328.8
ever get that far I mean it's going to

5326.119 --> 5330.239
cost altogether it really will it's not

5328.8 --> 5332.0
going to be I'm not going to just settle

5330.239 --> 5334.599999999999
for a freaking cheap computer if I'm

5332.0 --> 5336.0
going to do that again this was not a

5334.6 --> 5339.04
freaking cheap

5336.0 --> 5342.48
computer when I got

5339.04 --> 5345.32
it and it didn't have the latest of the

5342.48 --> 5348.36
latest it's just like not a cheap ass

5345.32 --> 5351.08
computer assemble that's

5348.36 --> 5353.599999999999
all right but when I get a new one if I

5351.08 --> 5356.8
ever get to that point I will not Tinker

5353.6 --> 5359.92
with it it will work and it will keep

5356.8 --> 5359.92
working for a

5360.92 --> 5363.92
decade

5375.56 --> 5381.719
new games in 4k oh 4K oh it's so

5379.44 --> 5385.599999999999
important quickly burn out your

5381.719 --> 5385.6
electronics we need a higher

5387.97 --> 5393.92
[Music]

5390.92 --> 5393.92
resolution

5411.199 --> 5415.5199999999995
all right anyway my graphics card is

5413.239 --> 5415.5199999999995
just

5416.32 --> 5424.92
fine and it probably can higher handle

5419.52 --> 5424.92
higher resolution although maybe that is

5425.6 --> 5428.6
it

5430.56 --> 5437.320000000001
no I'm not sure if my video card could

5434.32 --> 5439.119
actually handle Beyond

5437.32 --> 5442.159
10

5439.119 --> 5444.96
ADP maybe that is the reason why the

5442.159 --> 5448.96
monitor didn't

5444.96 --> 5448.96
work I never thought about

5450.84 --> 5453.84
that

5454.679 --> 5459.76
no but no no it should be I mean

5461.199 --> 5466.879999999999
no is weird though kind of freaked out

5464.36 --> 5466.88
by that right

5469.71 --> 5473.72
[Music]

5480.76 --> 5483.76
now

5488.4 --> 5492.92
the monitor will still work with it PE

5490.96 --> 5495.96
card okay

5492.92 --> 5498.639
right yeah I yeah because the monitor

5495.96 --> 5500.84
when I checked it it was just a bunch of

5498.639 --> 5501.6
black with a bunch of like white lines

5500.84 --> 5505.360000000001
on

5501.6 --> 5508.2390000000005
it like it's like really messed up which

5505.36 --> 5509.799999999999
usually means that like the actual

5508.239 --> 5513.199
distributor

5509.8 --> 5516.04
system like the internal Hardware of the

5513.199 --> 5519.678999999999
monitor to like distribute the image

5516.04 --> 5523.119
like it's [ __ ] that's what it looked

5519.679 --> 5523.84
like so it probably wasn't because of

5523.119 --> 5527.92
the

5523.84 --> 5527.92
card sounds damage

5532.88 --> 5538.88
yeah and it wasn't like oh it's frozen

5536.08 --> 5541.84
or whatever no it it things did actually

5538.88 --> 5543.719
happen in those weird lines so I did

5541.84 --> 5546.4400000000005
started up and I would see there was a

5543.719 --> 5548.719
shift so it was actually supposed to be

5546.44 --> 5551.759999999999
a representation of what was happening

5548.719 --> 5554.52
so it sounds like the what I would call

5551.76 --> 5556.79
the image distributor on the screen is

5554.52 --> 5558.2390000000005
completely broken that's what it looked

5556.79 --> 5560.96
[Music]

5558.239 --> 5562.799999999999
like mine's on screen broken yeah it's

5560.96 --> 5566.199
very typical by the

5562.8 --> 5568.400000000001
way and usually when a monitor shows

5566.199 --> 5570.638999999999
that kind of thing like a bunch of weird

5568.4 --> 5573.599999999999
lines and it looks

5570.639 --> 5575.159000000001
broken that's usually when your monitor

5573.6 --> 5577.76
is like permanently

5575.159 --> 5579.4
[ __ ] from what I've seen out there in

5577.76 --> 5583.320000000001
my life with

5579.4 --> 5585.4
monitors with LCD type monitors once you

5583.32 --> 5589.08
see like lines that cross the screen

5585.4 --> 5589.08
it's it's it's genuinely

5591.58 --> 5594.7789999999995
[Music]

5600.56 --> 5603.56
[ __ ]

5606.0 --> 5610.88
right anyway hopefully at some point I

5608.8 --> 5613.1990000000005
will be able to get a new monitor that

5610.88 --> 5615.1990000000005
would be kind of cool but for now I'll

5613.199 --> 5616.36
settle for just getting enough support

5615.199 --> 5618.879999999999
to

5616.36 --> 5621.96
eat I mean

5618.88 --> 5625.6
food starting to look more and more

5621.96 --> 5625.6
luxurious as time

5627.84 --> 5633.84
passes fine here in the PC in 4k okay

5631.88 --> 5636.76
good for

5633.84 --> 5641.76
you oh hopefully like everybody's

5636.76 --> 5641.76
stalling problems have ended with this

5643.32 --> 5648.239
stream and uh yeah it it is kind of like

5646.48 --> 5650.5199999999995
a maintenance stream we've mostly been

5648.239 --> 5653.959999999999
talking about issues breaking computers

5650.52 --> 5656.320000000001
and all that and YouTube giving issues

5653.96 --> 5658.04
because yeah when it gives massive

5656.32 --> 5660.759999999999
issues and half the people can't even

5658.04 --> 5663.199
watch the stream live yeah then then

5660.76 --> 5666.119000000001
it's going to be talked about that's

5663.199 --> 5666.119
what happens

5666.239 --> 5670.799999999999
