[Music]

69.28 --> 73.43900000000001
good

70.72 --> 75.6
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

73.439 --> 77.91999999999999
number 995

75.6 --> 80.0
i'm your host irwin and before we start

77.92 --> 82.56
the show please don't forget to share it

80.0 --> 84.64
on any platform you deem fit and if you

82.56 --> 86.72
haven't already subscribe to my channel

84.64 --> 89.04
hit the bell notification so you know

86.72 --> 91.2
when i'm going live which is normally 1

89.04 --> 93.28
pm amsterdam time in the weekdays and 2

91.2 --> 95.68
pm amsterdam time in the weekend and

93.28 --> 98.0
please also do support me through the

95.68 --> 100.32000000000001
paypal patreon crypto wallet super chat

98.0 --> 103.92
and the membership system join button

100.32 --> 103.91999999999999
that would be much appreciated

104.24 --> 107.92
so

105.119 --> 110.88
well weather

107.92 --> 110.88
turned around again

111.119 --> 116.32
now it's really sunny

113.52 --> 116.32
and windy

118.96 --> 125.19999999999999
still a bunch of clouds all over the

121.6 --> 127.67999999999999
place but yeah plenty of

125.2 --> 129.2
blue spots in between i do see some

127.68 --> 132.399
trail remnants

129.2 --> 132.399
out there up there

135.76 --> 139.84
but yeah

136.8 --> 143.84
nice and sunny

139.84 --> 143.84
so it did warm up a little again

144.0 --> 148.08
promises to be a very nice weekend

153.44 --> 157.35999999999999
right

154.879 --> 160.16
hello aries curse of man first in chat

157.36 --> 160.16000000000003
snowbirds

160.239 --> 165.12
huh

161.2 --> 167.11999999999998
well i did it i'm finally past the 2000

165.12 --> 168.959
subscribers

167.12 --> 171.20000000000002
at 2005

168.959 --> 173.44
so that certainly happened i think it

171.2 --> 175.92
might have something to do with

173.44 --> 178.72
little the debate going on over at

175.92 --> 183.11999999999998
mitchell from australia

178.72 --> 185.04
i was lucky enough to catch that live

183.12 --> 186.48000000000002
i had no idea it was going to be at this

185.04 --> 187.599
time slot but

186.48 --> 190.0
yeah

187.599 --> 191.51899999999998
i was there

190.0 --> 194.0
in chat

191.519 --> 196.0
sleeping warrior was also there dell was

194.0 --> 196.84
there and it was

196.0 --> 199.12
it was

196.84 --> 202.72
invigorating and

199.12 --> 202.72
well same old same old

203.28 --> 206.239
so

204.159 --> 209.04
yeah

206.239 --> 209.84
basically uh bob and groot tim's for all

209.04 --> 212.79899999999998
were

209.84 --> 214.959
kind to kind of initiating

212.799 --> 218.15900000000002
or attempting to initiate

214.959 --> 220.48
mitchell into the uh

218.159 --> 223.04
incoherent dielectric

220.48 --> 226.07999999999998
conception

223.04 --> 227.519
and well me

226.08 --> 230.0
and tony

227.519 --> 232.08
do what we always do we confront them

230.0 --> 234.159
with arguments

232.08 --> 236.48000000000002
that they don't address like the title

234.159 --> 239.48
of my show

236.48 --> 239.48
right

240.159 --> 247.04
because it's basically the same little

242.959 --> 250.959
things they forward as supposed proof

247.04 --> 250.959
but they never address

251.519 --> 257.28000000000003
any of the rebuttals ever and that's

254.08 --> 259.91900000000004
been years now years

257.28 --> 260.95899999999995
not a single at wrestle not a single

259.919 --> 263.919
time

260.959 --> 267.12
they literally white noise it out

263.919 --> 269.68
every single time

267.12 --> 272.72
right i don't even get like

269.68 --> 275.28000000000003
or something no no response white noise

272.72 --> 278.0
nothing no response it doesn't exist the

275.28 --> 279.52
question doesn't exist

278.0 --> 282.16
so yeah

279.52 --> 283.03999999999996
and pretty much been saying that what is

282.16 --> 286.47900000000004
it

283.04 --> 286.47900000000004
10 times in that chat

287.12 --> 292.24
thank you mitchell for well for handing

289.759 --> 294.0
me the wrench

292.24 --> 295.919
because

294.0 --> 297.52
i think i probably triggered a whole

295.919 --> 299.919
bunch of people

297.52 --> 302.0
by doing that and yeah the wrench does

299.919 --> 305.44
guarantee my free speech in your chat

302.0 --> 305.44
and i really appreciate that

305.52 --> 309.35999999999996
also i'd like to take note that as soon

307.36 --> 312.16
as

309.36 --> 315.91900000000004
bob noticed my presence in chat the

312.16 --> 319.6
first thing he did was start to complain

315.919 --> 321.68
about how we accused him of things and

319.6 --> 323.68
at homes and

321.68 --> 325.6
instead of of course addressing any

323.68 --> 328.32
rebuttals and arguments because that's

325.6 --> 330.96000000000004
what he always does and that's all fine

328.32 --> 332.88
you know it's not really a problem

330.96 --> 335.59999999999997
to me

332.88 --> 337.12
but it yeah can be very

335.6 --> 339.6
confusing

337.12 --> 341.759
if you haven't been around

339.6 --> 344.08000000000004
and paying attention on a daily basis

341.759 --> 347.91900000000004
for like four years

344.08 --> 350.08
on what's going on on the youtube scene

347.919 --> 352.08
anyway i hope kind of you're gonna visit

350.08 --> 353.59999999999997
my chat but i'm not sure you might just

352.08 --> 357.35999999999996
want to go to bed

353.6 --> 357.36
it is in australia after all

359.84 --> 363.59999999999997
all right so yeah mitchell from

361.28 --> 365.35999999999996
australia check him out i really

363.6 --> 368.72
appreciate his channel he's been doing a

365.36 --> 368.72
lot of interesting streams

369.12 --> 372.4
educational streams

373.12 --> 378.199
and yeah debates as well

380.319 --> 386.319
so yeah check out his channel and the

382.88 --> 390.4
video that just happened

386.319 --> 390.40000000000003
they just finished like half an hour ago

391.68 --> 394.40000000000003
but yeah you can check it out for

393.12 --> 398.319
yourself

394.4 --> 398.31899999999996
make sure to keep track of the chat

405.36 --> 409.36
hey don geos adventures yeah i saw you

408.4 --> 410.63899999999995
there

409.36 --> 414.0
in that chat

410.639 --> 414.0
good to have you over here

415.039 --> 420.68
michael khan too

417.36 --> 420.68
moon shadow

422.56 --> 427.36
anyway yeah i i just wanted to address

425.759 --> 430.96000000000004
this and see

427.36 --> 432.24
if if people have anything to say about

430.96 --> 435.12
it

432.24 --> 437.68
particularly you dungeo since you were

435.12 --> 439.52
there

437.68 --> 441.199
anybody else that was there i kind of

439.52 --> 444.31899999999996
hope mitchell would come on but yeah

441.199 --> 447.199
it's very late so he probably just

444.319 --> 448.96000000000004
needs to like either get dinner or just

447.199 --> 451.039
go to bed or something

448.96 --> 453.599
anyway

451.039 --> 456.08
if yeah

453.599 --> 459.84
if people are not super interested in

456.08 --> 461.44
this subject specifically then i'll just

459.84 --> 464.08
start talking about something else

461.44 --> 468.479
because this is my show

464.08 --> 468.479
i can talk about whatever i want

470.879 --> 476.199
not bound by any contract or narrative

480.879 --> 486.40000000000003
where's the cable in reality

483.039 --> 488.31899999999996
well look every example they give like

486.4 --> 490.0
even in nature look at the spider

488.319 --> 491.759
weaving his little thread and then he

490.0 --> 493.36
uses it to

491.759 --> 494.72
basically

493.36 --> 497.36
lighten

494.72 --> 499.199
his density and then fly off can be

497.36 --> 501.759
carried off by the wind right still

499.199 --> 503.84000000000003
requires some air pressure differential

501.759 --> 506.8
to be able to do anything with it but

503.84 --> 507.67999999999995
yeah what does he use that's he just

506.8 --> 509.039
like

507.68 --> 512.88
oh

509.039 --> 516.959
magical telekinesis no no a line

512.88 --> 518.399
a line oh look at the balloons

516.959 --> 520.7189999999999
the balloons the

518.399 --> 522.8
the supposed demonstration and it's all

520.719 --> 524.9590000000001
fine it's still interesting i'm not

522.8 --> 528.0799999999999
trying to downplay how interesting

524.959 --> 530.56
physical reality is i'm just

528.08 --> 530.5600000000001
trying to

531.44 --> 533.12
help

532.399 --> 535.2
get

533.12 --> 538.16
mistakes out of the way

535.2 --> 539.6800000000001
right so yeah the balloons oh look at

538.16 --> 541.36
the balloons they're floating in a

539.68 --> 544.4799999999999
certain thing then we introduce an

541.36 --> 546.64
electrostatic charge and suddenly it

544.48 --> 548.9590000000001
goes down and it goes up and it goes

546.64 --> 550.56
down isn't that interesting yeah how did

548.959 --> 551.4399999999999
you do that

550.56 --> 555.76
oh

551.44 --> 556.6400000000001
with a line with a line yeah i know i

555.76 --> 558.8
know

556.64 --> 560.88
you know why that is

558.8 --> 563.519
you know why there's a line

560.88 --> 565.12
because electrostatics electrostatic

563.519 --> 566.08
forces

565.12 --> 567.519
are

566.08 --> 569.839
very

567.519 --> 574.08
very short range

569.839 --> 577.12
oh and also palpable and measurable

574.08 --> 580.1600000000001
you can literally just like oh closer to

577.12 --> 581.6
the electrostatics close farther away

580.16 --> 584.7199999999999
right

581.6 --> 584.72
unlike with

585.519 --> 589.68
any

587.04 --> 591.04
displacement effect out there in the

589.68 --> 593.1999999999999
realm

591.04 --> 596.56
where the charge

593.2 --> 597.44
does not influence any displacement at

596.56 --> 600.0799999999999
all

597.44 --> 602.1600000000001
in mid-air

600.08 --> 604.24
right not saying that there cannot be

602.16 --> 607.6
any charge in any sort of way i mean

604.24 --> 611.6
like when lightning hits it is basically

607.6 --> 611.6
making the connection through the air

611.76 --> 617.279
but that's really heavy charge really

614.72 --> 619.12
measurable and it doesn't last very long

617.279 --> 620.959
right it requires

619.12 --> 622.16
tension build up

620.959 --> 624.8
and then

622.16 --> 627.8389999999999
if it's high enough then suddenly in a

624.8 --> 629.92
few moments it can discharge through the

627.839 --> 633.36
air by basically transforming the air

629.92 --> 634.7199999999999
into plasma to guide the electric

633.36 --> 636.72
connection right

634.72 --> 640.0790000000001
it's safe to say that that is not

636.72 --> 642.1600000000001
constantly happening at all time

640.079 --> 644.079
without being measurable

642.16 --> 647.64
everywhere right

644.079 --> 647.64
so yeah

648.16 --> 652.56
relative density

650.24 --> 653.76
is it it's it

652.56 --> 657.4399999999999
that is it

653.76 --> 660.88
it's the only thing that actually does

657.44 --> 662.8000000000001
the passive displacement vertically

660.88 --> 665.76
in this realm

662.8 --> 667.4399999999999
and that's it right other things might

665.76 --> 668.72
influence

667.44 --> 670.8800000000001
locally

668.72 --> 672.399
right

670.88 --> 675.04
but

672.399 --> 677.92
you cannot undo that relative density

675.04 --> 680.48
basically covers all passive vertical

677.92 --> 683.04
displacement all of it

680.48 --> 685.36
it covers all of it passive

683.04 --> 687.04
right passive not

685.36 --> 688.64
propelled

687.04 --> 692.56
not pushed

688.64 --> 695.519
by anything physical no just

692.56 --> 697.279
passive passive vertical displacement is

695.519 --> 698.9590000000001
all caused by relative density nothing

697.279 --> 701.04
undoes that

698.959 --> 702.959
not even

701.04 --> 704.64
diving down

702.959 --> 707.68
with a plane

704.64 --> 709.04
a sealed plane with its own internal

707.68 --> 711.4399999999999
container

709.04 --> 713.5999999999999
and things there in there

711.44 --> 715.6800000000001
seemingly free-floating right but it's

713.6 --> 718.88
not free-floating because the entire

715.68 --> 722.2399999999999
plane is actually in

718.88 --> 725.519
in the occupation of moving downwards

722.24 --> 728.0790000000001
which is what dense materials would do

725.519 --> 729.519
while the less dense materials

728.079 --> 732.3199999999999
basically

729.519 --> 734.8
have nowhere to go it's all sealed

732.32 --> 736.88
so it just goes into this array it

734.8 --> 739.279
doesn't

736.88 --> 742.639
find an equilibrium because it's all in

739.279 --> 746.8
the middle of moving and it can't find

742.639 --> 749.76
that rest it cannot find the equilibrium

746.8 --> 751.279
because it's all in motion

749.76 --> 755.12
right

751.279 --> 756.399
but that never happens with materials

755.12 --> 758.16
that are

756.399 --> 759.68
is stationary

758.16 --> 762.959
you don't that sort of thing only

759.68 --> 764.56
happens when you go in in a diving plane

762.959 --> 766.959
and then the whole thing is in motion

764.56 --> 770.079
but yeah if you're in the plane it just

766.959 --> 772.079
seems like oh but in relation to me

770.079 --> 774.959
it's not diving i could think of it as

772.079 --> 777.92
not diving but it is all diving though

774.959 --> 779.76
in reality in euclidean space

777.92 --> 783.36
the thing and everything in it in

779.76 --> 785.76
relation to the medium outside it is all

783.36 --> 788.24
going down so it is in the middle of

785.76 --> 791.04
displacing and when that happens

788.24 --> 794.0
yeah relative density

791.04 --> 795.92
this equilibrium acts weird because it

794.0 --> 797.68
basically can't find an equilibrium

795.92 --> 803.1999999999999
because it's all in the middle of moving

797.68 --> 803.1999999999999
and it will not find the equilibrium

809.12 --> 814.5600000000001
what you can't seem to find my paypal

812.959 --> 816.4799999999999
well

814.56 --> 818.4799999999999
that makes no sense

816.48 --> 822.72
tony whitcomb

818.48 --> 822.72
giulio pabin used it yesterday

823.839 --> 827.9200000000001
and you don't really need to find it

825.76 --> 830.92
using google the link is right here in

827.92 --> 830.92
chat

843.44 --> 846.639
that's working just fine

847.76 --> 851.6
hey

848.639 --> 854.6
julio peppin good to see you also amanda

851.6 --> 854.6
young

862.959 --> 867.92
oh my god not this guy again get the

865.279 --> 871.4399999999999
[ __ ] out here

867.92 --> 874.16
you magnet obsessed weirdo

871.44 --> 874.1600000000001
go away

878.399 --> 883.92
yeah it is there is the cursor man

881.519 --> 886.92
it's like he's not even trying to mask

917.12 --> 921.36
right

919.199 --> 923.76
so anyway uh

921.36 --> 925.279
yeah any comments on anything i've said

923.76 --> 929.12
any any

925.279 --> 931.36
exceptions you think exist

929.12 --> 933.279
to prove that

931.36 --> 936.24
bob

933.279 --> 938.959
and his following have a any sort of

936.24 --> 942.5600000000001
case in the face of my rebuttals i would

938.959 --> 942.56
be interested to hear about it

943.36 --> 945.6
right

950.88 --> 956.639
i mean have you thought of something

953.36 --> 960.16
have you heard what my rebuttals

956.639 --> 962.9590000000001
about this case about

960.16 --> 964.7199999999999
how electrostatics cannot be any factor

962.959 --> 966.6389999999999
in the passive

964.72 --> 968.8000000000001
displacement vertical displacement in

966.639 --> 971.519
the realm because it doesn't have the

968.8 --> 973.7589999999999
range without a landline

971.519 --> 977.199
you have any rebuttal to that i would be

973.759 --> 977.1990000000001
interested to hear about it

977.32 --> 983.6800000000001
diamagnetism paramagnetism well yeah

980.32 --> 986.5600000000001
that's still magnetism though right

983.68 --> 989.199
electrostatics are not magnetism

986.56 --> 989.199
it's different

991.68 --> 997.3599999999999
also yeah magnetism is measurable and

994.56 --> 999.5189999999999
literally decreases in strength over

997.36 --> 1004.0
distance measurably you can literally

999.519 --> 1006.399
model map it out the strength of it

1004.0 --> 1010.16
could potentially

1006.399 --> 1013.04
yeah sense it and then live virtually

1010.16 --> 1015.04
display the magnetic pattern and you

1013.04 --> 1017.8389999999999
could probably do the same to

1015.04 --> 1020.48
electrostatics maybe i'm not saying it's

1017.839 --> 1020.48
a guarantee

1020.959 --> 1027.839
it all has a range limit and the more

1024.4 --> 1030.0790000000002
range you want it to have the more

1027.839 --> 1032.1599999999999
measurable power

1030.079 --> 1033.839
you need to introduce

1032.16 --> 1037.6000000000001
every single time

1033.839 --> 1039.9189999999999
right it's extremely measurable

1037.6 --> 1042.0
relative density

1039.919 --> 1044.48
there's nothing to measure about it it

1042.0 --> 1045.52
is a passive displacement it just

1044.48 --> 1047.76
happens

1045.52 --> 1050.48
doesn't matter what the electrostatics

1047.76 --> 1052.8799999999999
or the power energy level in the air of

1050.48 --> 1056.88
some sort is it's going to do what it

1052.88 --> 1058.88
does every single time now of course

1056.88 --> 1060.4
can be influenced right you can

1058.88 --> 1062.16
introduce other forces you could

1060.4 --> 1064.799
probably like

1062.16 --> 1067.679
make it fall fast make something fall

1064.799 --> 1069.76
faster or fall slower

1067.679 --> 1072.24
but that doesn't take away that the

1069.76 --> 1073.6
relative density this equilibrium

1072.24 --> 1076.32
displacement

1073.6 --> 1077.4399999999998
is always there passively

1076.32 --> 1080.559
happening

1077.44 --> 1083.76
without any external electric form of

1080.559 --> 1084.6399999999999
energy to support it to create it at any

1083.76 --> 1087.919
height

1084.64 --> 1090.24
without objects connecting anything

1087.919 --> 1093.24
it just does what it does

1090.24 --> 1093.24
right

1107.039 --> 1110.96
just live again

1109.28 --> 1113.84
on the streets of london during the

protest i see

1113.919 --> 1117.6000000000001
she's really onto that these days

1119.28 --> 1123.16
anyway uh

1131.6 --> 1134.6
right

1145.12 --> 1148.0
it just does

1148.4 --> 1151.44
right

1149.28 --> 1152.799
well if it does something every single

1151.44 --> 1155.1200000000001
time

1152.799 --> 1158.72
and you can identify a naturally

1155.12 --> 1160.559
occurring phenomenon and influence it

1158.72 --> 1161.76
its effect

1160.559 --> 1165.36
then you have something that's

1161.76 --> 1167.76
scientifically proven now as to

1165.36 --> 1170.9599999999998
why does it do that

1167.76 --> 1174.559
that's inconsequential in the face of

1170.96 --> 1177.72
the scientific proof of its existence

1174.559 --> 1177.72
you see

1179.84 --> 1184.24
hey mitchell

1181.52 --> 1184.24
good to see you

1185.76 --> 1191.52
uh i hope you were listening in the last

1188.16 --> 1193.039
20 minutes because i pretty much covered

1191.52 --> 1194.799
a lot of things that happened during

1193.039 --> 1198.2
your show it was a really good show i

1194.799 --> 1198.2
linked it through

1207.84 --> 1210.6399999999999
and thanks for the wrenches by the way

1209.52 --> 1212.4
also

1210.64 --> 1215.44
to sleeping warrior

1212.4 --> 1217.52
that is definitely necessary if you're

1215.44 --> 1221.039
in a hangout where bob

1217.52 --> 1226.0
yeah does things

1221.039 --> 1228.08
because if you go against his arguments

1226.0 --> 1230.72
first he's gonna add home

1228.08 --> 1232.72
then he's gonna be very complaining oh

1230.72 --> 1235.039
i'm such a victim and then he will

1232.72 --> 1237.3600000000001
literally just remove you from the map

1235.039 --> 1239.679
if he can it's happened every single

1237.36 --> 1242.08
time every channel he has influence i'm

1239.679 --> 1245.44
banned every channel

1242.08 --> 1246.96
every channel where he is in chat i am

1245.44 --> 1249.8400000000001
banned

1246.96 --> 1249.8400000000001
all of them

yes you will need the wrenches indeed

glad you were aware of that

1279.84 --> 1286.08
youtube video there's live chat rules

1282.559 --> 1288.1589999999999
read them carefully if you think

1286.08 --> 1290.3999999999999
it's going to be too much of a hassle

1288.159 --> 1292.48
like if you have if you're like band

1290.4 --> 1293.76
trigger happy or [ __ ]

1292.48 --> 1295.2
then

1293.76 --> 1299.0

1356.559 --> 1361.3999999999999

all right so uh

1376.559 --> 1381.039
yeah

1378.32 --> 1383.12
is there anything else about the

1381.039 --> 1385.52
subject at hand you would like me to

1383.12 --> 1385.52
address

1387.12 --> 1390.1589999999999
because i've been paying attention to

1388.799 --> 1393.6
this right

1390.159 --> 1393.6000000000001
this is like part of my

1394.4 --> 1397.679
well

1395.28 --> 1400.48
this is my physics department right me

1397.679 --> 1403.2800000000002
and tony went at it it's like historical

1400.48 --> 1405.6
like that that's a bit overblown

1403.28 --> 1407.44
we went at one another

1405.6 --> 1410.7199999999998
when i still believed there had to be

1407.44 --> 1412.96
some kind of a gravity field i still

1410.72 --> 1415.2
held on to the conception

1412.96 --> 1417.52
i had my own version of it it's still

1415.2 --> 1418.799
out there the videos are still there

1417.52 --> 1422.4
and

1418.799 --> 1424.08
tony sleeping warrior was really

1422.4 --> 1425.919
figuring out the relative density and

1424.08 --> 1427.1999999999998
was doing his egg experiment and all

1425.919 --> 1429.919
that

1427.2 --> 1431.919
and we were at one another like almost

1429.919 --> 1433.44
at each other's throat very passionate

1431.919 --> 1434.72
and it all happened on the flat earth

1433.44 --> 1437.52
debates

1434.72 --> 1439.52
we all got so trained by this

1437.52 --> 1441.76
it's just that

1439.52 --> 1442.8799999999999
shit's not gonna slip past us we've had

1441.76 --> 1445.84
like three

1442.88 --> 1447.7600000000002
years training

1445.84 --> 1450.3999999999999
and i mean like really

1447.76 --> 1452.32
that's beyond university intensity

1450.4 --> 1455.3600000000001
training where you're just constantly

1452.32 --> 1459.4399999999998
debating like verbally testing right not

1455.36 --> 1463.12
just reading the books no actually

1459.44 --> 1465.3600000000001
debate testing it constantly

1463.12 --> 1470.84
and eventually [ __ ] just won't slip by

1465.36 --> 1470.84
you you will just see any any deviations

1474.4 --> 1480.5590000000002
and i'm really glad tony and me are on

1476.64 --> 1480.5590000000002
the same side now because god

1483.12 --> 1487.36
the guy is really a bulldog

1485.679 --> 1489.3600000000001
right

1487.36 --> 1491.12
once he got you

1489.36 --> 1494.3999999999999
there he just doesn't

1491.12 --> 1497.36
he's not gonna let it go

1494.4 --> 1500.3600000000001
you have to saw your leg off

1497.36 --> 1500.36
uh

1500.799 --> 1503.2
anyway

1504.799 --> 1508.96
yes mitchell yeah i knew you'd

1506.559 --> 1511.12
appreciate that

1508.96 --> 1513.52
i know you are literally now in the

1511.12 --> 1515.76
exploration phase of these arguments i

1513.52 --> 1517.44
know that you've been basically honestly

1515.76 --> 1520.0
saying that

1517.44 --> 1523.2
and so when i saw you were still alive i

1520.0 --> 1524.88
immediately drug tony in there because

1523.2 --> 1526.48
he was barely awake he didn't know you

1524.88 --> 1529.6000000000001
were live streaming so i said like dude

1526.48 --> 1530.72
you you have to be here right now

1529.6 --> 1534.7199999999998
this is

1530.72 --> 1534.72
this is gravity at stake here

1535.279 --> 1539.44
so i was very glad he was in there and

1536.88 --> 1542.159
dell from beyond the imaginary curve was

1539.44 --> 1543.8400000000001
also in there that was pretty cool it

1542.159 --> 1545.7600000000002
was a pretty cool chat

1543.84 --> 1547.76
and yeah

1545.76 --> 1549.36
interesting show

1547.76 --> 1554.039
i think that you

1549.36 --> 1554.039
held your ground pretty well

1557.279 --> 1562.799
oh really mitchell oh okay i didn't know

1559.84 --> 1562.799
you felt like that

1563.12 --> 1567.76
i guess you were trying to stay very

1565.279 --> 1571.84
modest i had no idea mitchell like where

1567.76 --> 1571.84
are you really at in the argument

1582.159 --> 1587.2
i i was particularly interested in the

1585.36 --> 1589.4399999999998
one moment

1587.2 --> 1592.159
where both bob and

1589.44 --> 1594.72
tim he's called tim right yeah

1592.159 --> 1596.88
both argued like no no no like relative

1594.72 --> 1599.3600000000001
density it's not it it's not the

1596.88 --> 1601.679
complete thing right there has to be

1599.36 --> 1603.4399999999998
something else blah blah blah and then

1601.679 --> 1606.3200000000002
like within two minutes they said yeah

1603.44 --> 1609.279
yeah it is all relative density

1606.32 --> 1611.6
now it does work

1609.279 --> 1614.64
what

1611.6 --> 1618.0
do you even know

1614.64 --> 1619.8400000000001
what you just did you guys did you

1618.0 --> 1622.08
it's like

1619.84 --> 1625.799
it's creepily

1622.08 --> 1625.799
eerily familiar

1626.88 --> 1629.7600000000002
if you know what i mean

1631.12 --> 1634.7199999999998
hey nathan oakley good to see you

1638.0 --> 1641.84
i could use you in idaho

1642.24 --> 1644.64
dude

1646.32 --> 1650.559
well banjo

1648.32 --> 1652.8799999999999
the thought banjo bear the thought has

1650.559 --> 1655.84
actually crossed my mind

1652.88 --> 1655.8400000000001
however

1659.84 --> 1663.039
things would have to pretty much

1661.679 --> 1665.8400000000001
radically

1663.039 --> 1668.96
alter in many ways for me to actually

1665.84 --> 1671.039
get to such a point where i'm at right

1668.96 --> 1673.3600000000001
now

1671.039 --> 1673.36
right

1674.64 --> 1679.3600000000001
i'm yeah you're not going to be able to

1676.32 --> 1681.84
go there for free right not even

1679.36 --> 1685.52
if i just like work the [ __ ] out of

1681.84 --> 1685.52
myself to get by

1686.24 --> 1690.48
which i don't have a lot of training in

1688.0 --> 1692.799
i have a lot of training in mind mind

1690.48 --> 1695.6
stuff

1692.799 --> 1696.96
and trying to stay healthy

1695.6 --> 1699.76
right

1696.96 --> 1699.76
that's about it

1700.32 --> 1705.6789999999999
i like working

1703.279 --> 1708.08
i have not had a

1705.679 --> 1710.799
farmer's life though

1708.08 --> 1712.6399999999999
as in like constantly

1710.799 --> 1714.48
hard labor

1712.64 --> 1716.7990000000002
i don't know if i do well

1714.48 --> 1719.2
if i would want to maneuver myself to

1716.799 --> 1722.559
that point i'd had to build it up and i

1719.2 --> 1725.2
would have to need

1722.559 --> 1728.8799999999999
the health resources and finances

1725.2 --> 1728.88
and the confidence a wife

1729.039 --> 1733.96
to actually get there i think

1740.72 --> 1744.559
yeah that's a good tip godzilla yet but

1743.279 --> 1747.279
i think that

1744.559 --> 1748.559
mitchell is very well aware of that

1747.279 --> 1749.679
he was

1748.559 --> 1751.44
if

1749.679 --> 1754.3990000000001
well if the things he's saying in chat

1751.44 --> 1756.48
right now are his standpoints

1754.399 --> 1759.1999999999998
then i must conclude that he's been

1756.48 --> 1762.2
extremely

1759.2 --> 1762.2
whole

1768.399 --> 1772.799
i hear you what things always work

1770.64 --> 1777.24
themselves out there okay

1772.799 --> 1777.24
i'll keep that in mind banjo bear

1800.559 --> 1804.6789999999999
dropping frames what

1821.279 --> 1827.12
yeah that it was hilarious mitchell

1824.48 --> 1828.96
that part about the gas where where does

1827.12 --> 1831.279
it go to

1828.96 --> 1835.1200000000001
they just couldn't seem to figure out

1831.279 --> 1838.64
that it goes in all directions right

1835.12 --> 1841.6
kind of uniformly but hey if it is less

1838.64 --> 1843.5200000000002
dense than the current amalgamations of

1841.6 --> 1846.08
gas that surround it

1843.52 --> 1846.96
then it will have a tendency to spread

1846.08 --> 1849.36
out

1846.96 --> 1850.88
a little bit more upward but it's still

1849.36 --> 1854.24
going to spread out in all directions

1850.88 --> 1856.72
including downward and the same goes for

1854.24 --> 1859.36
denser gas it will do the same it will

1856.72 --> 1861.3600000000001
spread in all directions but it will

1859.36 --> 1864.0
typically favor

1861.36 --> 1866.08
slightly downward

1864.0 --> 1868.32
at first right because eventually

1866.08 --> 1871.36
entropy just takes it all over and it

1868.32 --> 1874.559
all just becomes a blend

1871.36 --> 1877.799
in homogeneous mass

1874.559 --> 1877.799
of gas

1888.72 --> 1892.72
what are you talking about and it's an

1890.159 --> 1897.159
18 month setback

1892.72 --> 1897.159
what are you talking about

1910.559 --> 1912.799
hmm

1913.039 --> 1917.36
okay that's an interesting notion

1914.72 --> 1917.3600000000001
getting wisdom

1919.679 --> 1924.48
right well entropy had to start at some

1921.919 --> 1924.48
point right

1924.799 --> 1927.76
so as soon as

1927.84 --> 1932.559
like

1929.2 --> 1935.76
change was introduced

1932.559 --> 1940.24
that must have been the start of entropy

1935.76 --> 1940.24
as soon as things started changing

1942.559 --> 1949.039
and maybe yeah maybe that was let there

1945.2 --> 1949.919
be light or maybe it was the first word

1949.039 --> 1952.399
or

1949.919 --> 1953.3600000000001
was the first word let there be light i

1952.399 --> 1955.84
don't think

1953.36 --> 1959.8799999999999
it was later right

1955.84 --> 1959.8799999999999
i might be mixing it up

1975.36 --> 1978.559
okay nothing

1983.919 --> 1988.88
anyone else get a load of dropped frames

1985.84 --> 1991.6
yes nathan now my streams

1988.88 --> 1994.88
get delays a lot it's really annoying

1991.6 --> 1996.6399999999999
sometimes it just won't play and i can

1994.88 --> 1998.159
literally see

1996.64 --> 2000.64
the red bar

1998.159 --> 2003.279
just going backwards showing all this

2000.64 --> 2006.159
grey just it just refuses to play you

2003.279 --> 2008.96
have to i have to then personally

2006.159 --> 2011.519
scroll that bar back forward to stay at

2008.96 --> 2014.0
where i'm at during the stream it's very

2011.519 --> 2014.0
annoying

2014.48 --> 2018.3600000000001
i don't know why that happens

2029.6 --> 2033.1999999999998
you can do without your own side being

2031.6 --> 2036.24
poisoned against you when you're just

2033.2 --> 2039.2
starting out on youtube yes that's true

2036.24 --> 2039.2
on the other hand

2040.96 --> 2046.32
when the only ones that do start out are

2044.08 --> 2047.4399999999998
too afraid to confront anything and

2046.32 --> 2049.359
anyone

2047.44 --> 2051.119
then there will be no progress made

2049.359 --> 2052.24
there will just be a lot of weeds

2051.119 --> 2053.52
everywhere

2052.24 --> 2055.52
right

2053.52 --> 2058.839
there's not gonna come any trees out of

2055.52 --> 2058.839
that so

2060.72 --> 2065.359
but yeah if you're going to go

2062.72 --> 2067.359
head-on in a confrontation and then get

2065.359 --> 2069.359
scared afterward

2067.359 --> 2071.7599999999998
then you got a problem but if you're

2069.359 --> 2075.839
ready for a fight

2071.76 --> 2075.8390000000004
it might just work to your advantage

2086.24 --> 2091.52
oh cleary

2088.56 --> 2091.52
yeah she does that

2094.0 --> 2099.119
i think she unblocked me though without

2096.639 --> 2101.44
even saying just at one point suddenly

2099.119 --> 2103.839
she could read my messages

2101.44 --> 2106.96
but yeah i don't really care

2103.839 --> 2106.96
i i'm done with that

2109.52 --> 2114.32
i don't feel she can provide me with any

2111.76 --> 2117.8390000000004
more information that's gonna be of any

2114.32 --> 2117.839
use to me

2129.44 --> 2134.2000000000003
oh my god

2131.2 --> 2134.2
what

2153.839 --> 2159.2
you have to be respectful

2156.48 --> 2160.4
you mean you have to just

2159.2 --> 2163.52
shut up

2160.4 --> 2167.32
and suck up yeah i know nathan

2163.52 --> 2167.32
it's not worth it

2177.04 --> 2181.839
all right and hey everybody knows where

2179.28 --> 2181.8390000000004
i stand

2184.64 --> 2194.16
if you have easily triggered trinitarian

2190.079 --> 2195.2000000000003
priesthood spell conditioning

2194.16 --> 2197.2799999999997
then

2195.2 --> 2201.5989999999997
yeah you're gonna have a problem with me

2197.28 --> 2203.2000000000003
because i will never stop that yeah

2201.599 --> 2207.28
to me

2203.2 --> 2209.9199999999996
it's just like addressing oh look

2207.28 --> 2213.119
show me electrostatic displacement over

2209.92 --> 2214.4
a distance without a landline yeah

2213.119 --> 2215.2000000000003
so show me

2214.4 --> 2218.32
how

2215.2 --> 2219.9199999999996
the trinity makes logical sense with

2218.32 --> 2221.3590000000004
everything else

2219.92 --> 2224.2400000000002
that was

2221.359 --> 2226.48
said in the bible and jesus what jesus

2224.24 --> 2229.4399999999996
himself said and how he acted what he

2226.48 --> 2231.44
did tell me how that makes it any

2229.44 --> 2234.32
literal sense yeah it doesn't right

2231.44 --> 2236.56
because to me it's just another argument

2234.32 --> 2239.76
that requires addressing

2236.56 --> 2240.96
i know what i'm talking about and i will

2239.76 --> 2244.1600000000003
never

2240.96 --> 2244.16
let go

2244.8 --> 2249.76
and there's people out there that just

2246.88 --> 2251.44
cannot handle that they gotta squirt and

2249.76 --> 2254.48
they'll scream to me

2251.44 --> 2256.48
you're you're a demon you're a devil for

2254.48 --> 2257.359
thinking this you're gonna go to eternal

2256.48 --> 2259.359
hell

2257.359 --> 2260.88
they will do that and if they don't say

2259.359 --> 2263.04
it out loud they'll think it because

2260.88 --> 2264.7200000000003
that's what the conditioning does

2263.04 --> 2267.2
right

2264.72 --> 2272.16
chant this chant

2267.2 --> 2273.1189999999997
or you go to hell yeah that's not

2272.16 --> 2275.7599999999998
jesus

2273.119 --> 2278.079
definitely did not advise to act like

2275.76 --> 2278.079
that

2308.48 --> 2311.599
oh cleary

2310.0 --> 2313.92
maybe you should be a little bit more

2311.599 --> 2316.0
subtle and not say like oh you can never

2313.92 --> 2317.839
why don't you just ask her

2316.0 --> 2320.0
hey

2317.839 --> 2322.4
could you be wrong about this have you

2320.0 --> 2324.72
ever considered you might be wrong about

2322.4 --> 2324.7200000000003
this

2325.2 --> 2329.359
what did you think about that

2330.079 --> 2333.28
right

2331.28 --> 2335.6800000000003
if you're just gonna say it like that

2333.28 --> 2338.2400000000002
yeah that's very easy to see as an

2335.68 --> 2340.64
offense for the easily triggerable if

2338.24 --> 2342.0
you just ask

2340.64 --> 2345.68
it

2342.0 --> 2348.8
then you you actually open up the door

2345.68 --> 2348.7999999999997
for somebody to

2348.88 --> 2354.8
reconsider the choice

2351.28 --> 2356.5600000000004
they made you see

2354.8 --> 2359.2000000000003
that's how this works that's how this

2356.56 --> 2359.2
realm works

2359.76 --> 2364.32
this is

2361.359 --> 2367.64
okay nathan

2364.32 --> 2367.6400000000003
hill megatron

2376.32 --> 2380.6400000000003
oh well godzilla i'm with you with that

2378.24 --> 2383.839
look i'm not saying that paula is not

2380.64 --> 2383.839
very well studied

2384.16 --> 2391.2799999999997
i'm not claiming to match her oversight

2387.92 --> 2393.839
on the content of the bible

2391.28 --> 2393.8390000000004
i'm just

2394.079 --> 2400.5600000000004
fairly certain that she is

2397.119 --> 2402.0
trained to overlook certain ways of

2400.56 --> 2403.44
approach

2402.0 --> 2406.8
through

2403.44 --> 2408.96
distinct priestly conditioning that come

2406.8 --> 2411.2000000000003
typically with

2408.96 --> 2413.28
extreme study of it

2411.2 --> 2415.1189999999997
and the people the other people that

2413.28 --> 2418.0
also do it

2415.119 --> 2420.4
everybody conditions each other

2418.0 --> 2420.4
you see

2420.88 --> 2425.04
because it's not just study the bible

2422.96 --> 2429.28
study about no it studied the bible and

2425.04 --> 2431.92
come to these conclusions about it also

2429.28 --> 2434.1600000000003
condition it in you you must believe

2431.92 --> 2436.48
this that's all part of it yeah yeah

2434.16 --> 2438.72
tony whitcomb sorry thank you i will

2436.48 --> 2442.599
check my paypal it's just a little

2438.72 --> 2442.5989999999997
preoccupied here

2454.24 --> 2457.7599999999998
whoa

2456.4 --> 2459.6800000000003
dude

2457.76 --> 2461.76
thank you so much

2459.68 --> 2464.16
i really appreciate that tony whitcomb

2461.76 --> 2468.96
that is awesome

2464.16 --> 2468.96
oh that's definitely very very helpful

2472.24 --> 2478.359
thank you

2473.839 --> 2478.359
for the support you're awesome

2499.44 --> 2502.4
yeah mitchell

2502.8 --> 2507.52
be wary though if you're really going to

2505.119 --> 2509.839
be like part of it part of the team

2507.52 --> 2509.839
there

2511.599 --> 2516.56
you're not gonna get a chance to

2513.52 --> 2519.599
basically address the real issues

2516.56 --> 2522.319
because they will literally

2519.599 --> 2525.2000000000003
act disappointed and then hand wave

2522.319 --> 2527.839
dismiss it and quickly move on to

2525.2 --> 2529.9199999999996
another little proof see about it

2527.839 --> 2532.7999999999997
that's what they do so

2529.92 --> 2535.28
if you really think you can get in their

2532.8 --> 2536.4
team and publicly

2535.28 --> 2538.6400000000003
disprove

2536.4 --> 2541.6800000000003
their notions that's not gonna work

2538.64 --> 2544.96
others have tried very trained people

2541.68 --> 2546.96
have tried right you can try

2544.96 --> 2549.599
i'm just saying

2546.96 --> 2551.599
how it's gonna roll out because that's

2549.599 --> 2555.28
what happens every single time trust me

2551.599 --> 2555.28
about this i've paid attention

2557.68 --> 2562.64
anthony and bob in one

2560.8 --> 2565.6800000000003
no way

2562.64 --> 2570.16
no way keep dreaming mitchell keep

2565.68 --> 2570.16
dreaming that's never gonna happen

2570.64 --> 2573.839
wow

2572.079 --> 2576.5600000000004
like heaven and earth would literally

2573.839 --> 2577.68
have to be moved to get to that point

2576.56 --> 2580.48
man

2577.68 --> 2580.48
there's no way

2586.56 --> 2591.359
because you know yeah but i don't think

2588.64 --> 2594.4
you know the extent of how impossible

2591.359 --> 2594.4
that is really

2595.68 --> 2601.3999999999996
but hey

2597.44 --> 2601.4
one can dream right

2616.319 --> 2622.079
now you're gonna have to settle for

2618.56 --> 2624.4
having tony in chat and bob on

2622.079 --> 2626.1600000000003
on speaker right

2624.4 --> 2629.599
that's the only way they're ever going

2626.16 --> 2630.64
to be like in sort of the same place

2629.599 --> 2632.96
because

2630.64 --> 2635.839
these guys really get on each other's

2632.96 --> 2635.839
nerves

2636.079 --> 2638.319
right

2638.56 --> 2643.7599999999998
and they're both kind of compulsive in

2640.88 --> 2646.56
like a weird similar pattern it's just

2643.76 --> 2647.5200000000004
gonna explode very quickly

2646.56 --> 2649.7599999999998
and

2647.52 --> 2652.0
not explode as in loud and super

2649.76 --> 2654.1600000000003
triggered but they're just gonna

2652.0 --> 2656.319
start nagging each other and then

2654.16 --> 2658.56
eventually like get spellbound get

2656.319 --> 2660.88
locked in you're not even gonna get in

2658.56 --> 2662.64
between there like that's gonna happen

2660.88 --> 2663.92
if they would ever choose to do that but

2662.64 --> 2666.7999999999997
they're not gonna choose to do that

2663.92 --> 2667.76
because they don't want that to happen

2666.8 --> 2669.92
well

2667.76 --> 2671.8390000000004
maybe tony would actually want that to

2669.92 --> 2673.76
happen i'm pretty sure bob doesn't want

2671.839 --> 2676.56
that to happen

2673.76 --> 2678.7200000000003
god now i'm just thinking maybe

2676.56 --> 2681.52
maybe it could just

2678.72 --> 2681.52
sadly happen

2682.48 --> 2687.76
maybe i'm wrong about it but like

2685.92 --> 2690.0
i doubt there's going to be like an

2687.76 --> 2691.2000000000003
agreeable conversation coming out of

2690.0 --> 2693.28
that

2691.2 --> 2695.04
like that's never gonna happen

2693.28 --> 2699.119
but they might find the courage to

2695.04 --> 2699.119
actually face each other at some point

2701.359 --> 2705.56
and with them i mean bob

2723.839 --> 2728.56
ah good pun there cleary

2726.72 --> 2731.1189999999997
you don't understand the gravity of the

2728.56 --> 2734.24
situation

2731.119 --> 2734.2400000000002
oh that's hilarious

2742.0 --> 2745.96
tony phil june okay

2756.72 --> 2761.04
get caught in the cross i don't exactly

2759.2 --> 2763.1189999999997
know what you mean by that nathan i

2761.04 --> 2765.44
think the worst thing that can happen is

2763.119 --> 2768.1600000000003
that bob is just going to

2765.44 --> 2770.88
put mitchell on the no-no list like

2768.16 --> 2773.359
every everybody else

2770.88 --> 2775.76
he's just gonna like oh oh you had all

2773.359 --> 2779.68
this connection opportunity now i'm

2775.76 --> 2783.3590000000004
gonna use that peer pressure of mine

2779.68 --> 2785.9199999999996
to basically excommunicate you because

2783.359 --> 2787.5989999999997
you dared question

2785.92 --> 2789.6800000000003
the dogma

2787.599 --> 2790.88
my dogma right

2789.68 --> 2793.2799999999997
that's what he's going to do it's what

2790.88 --> 2794.8
he did to me it's what he did to adam

2793.28 --> 2798.4
it's what he did to

2794.8 --> 2798.4
a whole bunch of people

2800.839 --> 2804.56
brian all of them

2812.88 --> 2817.6400000000003
so but hey it's your choice man

2818.23 --> 2821.349
[Music]

2824.8 --> 2831.8390000000004
10 space bucks say it will never happen

2829.359 --> 2831.839
okay

2836.079 --> 2840.48
as long as it's not stolen space box

2841.04 --> 2848.2799999999997
i'm not gonna lie to the

2843.2 --> 2848.2799999999997
space police force for you clearly

2859.04 --> 2864.96
do i hear hundred arwenian rupiah

2862.64 --> 2864.96
dude

2866.4 --> 2875.839
you know one armenian rupee is like

2870.4 --> 2875.839
is measured in kilograms of gold right

2878.0 --> 2882.28
like that's the value of it

2895.44 --> 2901.839
right and that's why it's like

2898.559 --> 2901.8390000000004
there is no inflation

2903.76 --> 2908.2400000000002
it's only gonna be worth more it's very

2906.319 --> 2911.04
simple

2908.24 --> 2914.359
one armenian unit one kilogram of gold

2911.04 --> 2914.359
that's it

2919.76 --> 2925.0
the only currency still on gold standard

2921.76 --> 2925.0
yeah yeah

2951.359 --> 2959.2
i have we have to

2954.0 --> 2959.2
have a bet to make on tony and bob

2960.88 --> 2966.839
but i really need it

2963.44 --> 2966.839
damn it

2978.559 --> 2983.599
i mean you can't just put money in the

2981.599 --> 2985.6800000000003
street performers hat

2983.599 --> 2987.3590000000004
and then grab it out of the head again

2985.68 --> 2991.3999999999996
that's like

2987.359 --> 2991.4
asking for trouble man

2999.76 --> 3004.48
spacebox don't incur inflation in a

3002.72 --> 3005.839
vacuum

3004.48 --> 3008.96
lull

3005.839 --> 3010.319
but spacebox it's it's still only fiat

3008.96 --> 3012.8
currency though

3010.319 --> 3014.8
so it's worth whatever the people think

3012.8 --> 3018.88
it's worth it doesn't actually have

3014.8 --> 3018.88
inherent value there's no backing of it

3020.8 --> 3025.599
like space is the only backing it has

3023.52 --> 3026.4
the only backing it has is that there

3025.599 --> 3029.44
can

3026.4 --> 3032.079
be an infinity of it

3029.44 --> 3035.359
because space is infinitely big that's

3032.079 --> 3039.1600000000003
the only trait about it

3035.359 --> 3039.16
it'll never run out

3040.64 --> 3045.44
i guess that kind of makes it the u.s

3042.64 --> 3045.44
dollar doesn't it

3049.599 --> 3052.92
thanks tony

3055.52 --> 3058.52
uh

3059.23 --> 3062.42
[Music]

3075.04 --> 3080.44
oh

3076.319 --> 3080.44
pj krishank are you

3083.52 --> 3086.079
too well

3089.599 --> 3092.7200000000003
all right

3090.72 --> 3095.72
yeah take it easy dude get some good

3092.72 --> 3095.72
rest

3103.92 --> 3107.839
i had a pretty late

3105.44 --> 3108.88
night myself last night

3107.839 --> 3111.2
as in

3108.88 --> 3113.52
kind of insanely late now that i think

3111.2 --> 3114.7999999999997
about it it's like six o'clock or

3113.52 --> 3115.839
something i

3114.8 --> 3117.8390000000004
i was

3115.839 --> 3120.319
oh i remember why

3117.839 --> 3122.64
because i was in a live stream that i've

3120.319 --> 3125.7599999999998
never been before

3122.64 --> 3128.7999999999997
what's this what's it again

3125.76 --> 3131.76
yeah the the felon show

3128.8 --> 3134.079
with king dave

3131.76 --> 3135.3590000000004
uh he's like a mud flutter

3134.079 --> 3136.88
and he did a

3135.359 --> 3139.5989999999997
live show

3136.88 --> 3141.76
kind of similar setup as to what martin

3139.599 --> 3143.44
luther does in many ways even the

3141.76 --> 3145.5200000000004
methods

3143.44 --> 3148.079
and that lasted like three hours and it

3145.52 --> 3150.0
was a really spiritual

3148.079 --> 3153.1600000000003
chat and all that and it was in there

3150.0 --> 3153.16
and just

3154.8 --> 3161.2400000000002
it was very intense but interesting so i

3157.359 --> 3161.24
had a late night myself

3171.92 --> 3174.92
hmm

3203.359 --> 3206.88
can i do a special shout out to the

3205.68 --> 3209.2799999999997
debate

3206.88 --> 3212.2400000000002
yeah of course

3209.28 --> 3212.2400000000002
nathan of course

3214.88 --> 3218.559
yeah the flat earth debates of course

3216.88 --> 3220.559
it's saturday and it's going to be the

3218.559 --> 3221.76
flat earth debates from last

3220.559 --> 3222.8
thursday

3221.76 --> 3225.92
which was

3222.8 --> 3225.92
super long

3227.04 --> 3229.359
uh

3230.4 --> 3237.64
like who with who was it right it was

3233.2 --> 3237.64
with the baller right i don't remember

3240.24 --> 3244.9599999999996
anyway it was a pretty good show it was

3242.079 --> 3248.7200000000003
extremely long like past six so it

3244.96 --> 3248.7200000000003
lasted a total of four hours

3248.96 --> 3253.92
postal

3251.2 --> 3253.9199999999996
right right

3255.119 --> 3259.92
yeah that guy god anyway yeah it's gonna

3258.319 --> 3262.839
be an interesting show i'll be watching

3259.92 --> 3267.92
the premiere definitely

3262.839 --> 3269.119
nathan yeah you you may proceed to post

3267.92 --> 3272.2400000000002
a link

3269.119 --> 3273.44
of it in my chat

3272.24 --> 3275.7599999999998
please

3273.44 --> 3275.76
yes

3276.319 --> 3279.5589999999997
thank you

3283.52 --> 3289.92
going postal right oh god yeah he was at

3286.88 --> 3289.92
it very much so

3290.64 --> 3296.24
all right it was very good show very

3292.88 --> 3299.44
intense and so was a friday show that's

3296.24 --> 3299.4399999999996
going to premiere tomorrow

3300.16 --> 3303.52
but this one was the longest was the

3302.16 --> 3307.04
longest

3303.52 --> 3309.52
show after show we've had in a long time

3307.04 --> 3312.48
it's even longer than the the ones

3309.52 --> 3313.52
from last week which were also quite

3312.48 --> 3315.119
long

3313.52 --> 3318.16
anyway

3315.119 --> 3318.1600000000003
yeah show's almost

3318.839 --> 3322.799
over it was interesting

3323.04 --> 3327.72
very active chat today i like that

3344.4 --> 3349.28
you've seen it after 10 pm

3346.799 --> 3351.7599999999998
oh you mean the members only stream tony

3349.28 --> 3351.76
whitcomb

3353.92 --> 3357.6800000000003
right well technically i'm not a member

3360.16 --> 3363.7599999999998
although

3361.359 --> 3366.16
i'm not sure if i if with a wrench you

3363.76 --> 3369.28
can still watch the members only shows

3366.16 --> 3369.2799999999997
nathan do you know

3371.52 --> 3374.319
because i might just be seeing it right

3373.44 --> 3377.04
i

3374.319 --> 3377.839
went a premiere from nathan's comes on i

3377.04 --> 3380.24
just

3377.839 --> 3382.5589999999997
check it out if unless i'm preoccupied

3380.24 --> 3385.52
with something else i'm not always even

3382.559 --> 3387.92
sure like when

3385.52 --> 3390.559
from what day that show is like if it's

3387.92 --> 3392.64
the the show from the same day or day

3390.559 --> 3394.799
before

3392.64 --> 3398.72
i'm not always that sure nathan has a

3394.799 --> 3402.92
lot of freaking premieres man a lot

3398.72 --> 3402.9199999999996
it's hard to keep track of

3407.28 --> 3410.799
no freebies that's fine

3415.599 --> 3421.2000000000003
it's all right because i can be there

3418.24 --> 3422.8799999999997
live when it is being recorded so

3421.2 --> 3425.5989999999997
you know

3422.88 --> 3425.599
no worries

3428.96 --> 3432.7200000000003
yeah globers definitely don't like this

3431.28 --> 3436.2400000000002
accident mitchell

3432.72 --> 3436.24
they really really don't

3436.64 --> 3443.2
oh and though i am curious like

3440.559 --> 3446.88
i think i asked that silly question on

3443.2 --> 3448.8799999999997
like yesterday's after show as well

3446.88 --> 3451.119
didn't really get a response because

3448.88 --> 3453.76
people are just like still enjoying the

3451.119 --> 3456.1600000000003
victory a little too much i think

3453.76 --> 3458.079
well not too much enough enough to

3456.16 --> 3460.8799999999997
distract them away from

3458.079 --> 3462.799
seriously considering like if the earth

3460.88 --> 3464.48
was a glow i know that's always a stupid

3462.799 --> 3467.52
question right if the earth was a glow

3464.48 --> 3470.48
but what if it was

3467.52 --> 3472.48
how would you use celestial navigation

3470.48 --> 3477.119
like how would you you how would a

3472.48 --> 3477.119
sextant have to be designed in order to

3477.2 --> 3481.5989999999997
well work

3479.44 --> 3483.92
in any sort of way

3481.599 --> 3486.559
like it might work different it might be

3483.92 --> 3489.359
less accurate but how would it actually

3486.559 --> 3491.44
work how would you have to design it

3489.359 --> 3494.5589999999997
if the earth was actually a globe now

3491.44 --> 3494.559
that's an interesting

3495.04 --> 3499.92
concept to think about right

3498.4 --> 3503.76
because this is just

3499.92 --> 3506.0
world design dynamics

3503.76 --> 3507.5200000000004
if everything was like this how would it

3506.0 --> 3509.52
naturally develop how would the

3507.52 --> 3511.2
mechanics work

3509.52 --> 3513.52
right

3511.2 --> 3514.48
it's like a reconstruction process on

3513.52 --> 3518.24
the

3514.48 --> 3520.48
on the yeah on a planar scale

3518.24 --> 3522.64
i like to consider those things a lot

3520.48 --> 3523.839
i'm a cosmogenist i like

3522.64 --> 3525.68
doing that

3523.839 --> 3527.359
and i'm just thinking about yeah bendy

3525.68 --> 3528.64
sexton would it be

3527.359 --> 3531.7599999999998
would it be a

3528.64 --> 3533.92
more than 90 degrees sexting would it

3531.76 --> 3536.7200000000003
how would that work

3533.92 --> 3538.96
i'm just curious like would it somehow

3536.72 --> 3541.52
be possible i know that the section how

3538.96 --> 3542.96
it is designed right now definitely

3541.52 --> 3545.2
wouldn't work on the globe that's

3542.96 --> 3548.079
blatantly obvious right

3545.2 --> 3549.359
it's meant for a flat plane in every way

3548.079 --> 3551.92
but if

3549.359 --> 3554.16
the earth actually was a globe with the

3551.92 --> 3556.64
geometric horizon with

3554.16 --> 3558.48
the fall with the stars actually having

3556.64 --> 3560.319
a supposed euclidean position in the

3558.48 --> 3562.799
distance and that's

3560.319 --> 3563.92
why when you move over the earth

3562.799 --> 3566.559
they

3563.92 --> 3567.76
you basically rotate underneath it all

3566.559 --> 3572.4
how

3567.76 --> 3574.96
could a sort of sextant work for

3572.4 --> 3577.52
navigation if the earth was a globe i

3574.96 --> 3579.599
just find that an interesting thing to

3577.52 --> 3581.599
think about and i don't know i don't

3579.599 --> 3583.839
know what it exactly would be like i'm

3581.599 --> 3585.119
just wondering those that have really

3583.839 --> 3587.92
dug into

3585.119 --> 3590.079
the mechanics of how sextant work

3587.92 --> 3591.04
could they figure that out

3590.079 --> 3593.04
could

3591.04 --> 3595.119
could they like

3593.04 --> 3597.2799999999997
make a comparison like here's a section

3595.119 --> 3598.48
in the real flat world right this is how

3597.28 --> 3601.119
it works

3598.48 --> 3602.96
this is how it would work on the globe

3601.119 --> 3604.96
it would have to be like this and then

3602.96 --> 3607.76
you have this dilemma and this rich

3604.96 --> 3610.0
problem etc etc i'd just be very curious

3607.76 --> 3615.0400000000004
what would a globe

3610.0 --> 3617.599
cosmology sextant be like just a

3615.04 --> 3620.5589999999997
consideration that's all

3617.599 --> 3622.7200000000003
anyway i'm not expecting anybody to to

3620.559 --> 3625.76
latch onto this it's just one of those

3622.72 --> 3626.48
arwenian little curiosities of mine

3625.76 --> 3629.2000000000003
so

3626.48 --> 3632.0
anyway i'm rounding out thanks everyone

3629.2 --> 3634.24
for coming i hope you appreciate it and

3632.0 --> 3636.319
like this show if you did then please
