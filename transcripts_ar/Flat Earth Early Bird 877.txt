83.04 --> 93.43900000000001
so whether today is

87.68 --> 93.43900000000001
beautiful warm a bit more cloudy

95.119 --> 102.159
a lot more hazy especially

98.56 --> 105.36
it was kind of like almost completely

102.159 --> 107.119
hazy in the morning but it's clearing up

105.36 --> 111.2
somewhat

107.119 --> 114.0
still some but yeah it's not really

111.2 --> 117.28
perfectly blue

114.0 --> 117.28
still very nice day

118.0 --> 121.28
nice and warm outside

125.2 --> 129.84
all right

131.28 --> 133.599
so

134.959 --> 139.84
it's april the 28th

140.84 --> 143.84
2021

154.84 --> 157.84
wednesday

165.92 --> 169.28
and i'm doing okay

169.44 --> 175.28
i got up a little earlier to deal with

172.56 --> 175.28
some things

178.239 --> 184.0
and things are looking good

181.68 --> 185.519
although it seems like the the rush i

184.0 --> 188.64
got yesterday

185.519 --> 188.64000000000001
is also kind of done

189.76 --> 192.159
all right

193.68 --> 196.959
so i maybe have a couple of silent

196.08 --> 200.08
pauses

196.959 --> 202.56
this show is what i think although yeah

200.08 --> 204.4
yesterday the chat was all buzzing so

202.56 --> 205.84
maybe it'll get going like that as well

204.4 --> 208.31900000000002
today

205.84 --> 208.31900000000002
let's see

211.2 --> 215.28
all right but yesterday was it was an

213.599 --> 218.64
interesting day

215.28 --> 220.64000000000001
hey steamy traveler first in chat

218.64 --> 221.92
it's been a while hope i'm okay yeah i'm

220.64 --> 224.48
doing good

221.92 --> 224.48
i'm okay

230.64 --> 236.07999999999998
but anyway yesterday was apparently

233.439 --> 236.07999999999998
king's day

236.159 --> 243.519
and that revealed itself by just

240.0 --> 247.04
a lot of people being outside

243.519 --> 250.799
and just all over the city just in the

247.04 --> 254.239
in the park by the side of the road even

250.799 --> 254.72
like on the pavement with tables and

254.239 --> 257.759
stuff

254.72 --> 258.239
and so it was like an outside cafe

257.759 --> 261.28000000000003
almost

258.239 --> 262.07899999999995
everywhere it was really interesting to

261.28 --> 264.63899999999995
see

262.079 --> 267.12
nobody was wearing masks really barely

264.639 --> 267.12
anybody

267.52 --> 274.639
and it was a good atmosphere the

271.04 --> 276.96000000000004
yeah i got like the impression like

274.639 --> 278.8
people were remembering again what it is

276.96 --> 282.88
to just be

278.8 --> 285.28000000000003
doing such things normally

282.88 --> 286.96
almost like a flashback to how it used

285.28 --> 292.0
to be

286.96 --> 293.44
but yeah it was i was enjoying it

292.0 --> 296.56
it's really getting into any

293.44 --> 298.71999999999997
conversation with anybody but just

296.56 --> 299.919
going out for groceries and just looking

298.72 --> 304.16
around

299.919 --> 307.84
it was nice and the weather was great

304.16 --> 312.56
right hey dean wright

307.84 --> 312.56
slobo moon buggy good to see you

313.28 --> 315.52
ah

316.56 --> 319.52
i'm detecting

320.4 --> 326.79999999999995
i completely forgot to make notes

323.68 --> 329.759
scribble something together quickly i do

326.8 --> 329.759
roughly remember

332.96 --> 342.63899999999995
flat earth debate was i was good enough

338.4 --> 346.15999999999997
uh yeah more it's it's really still

342.639 --> 346.16
going on about the whole

346.72 --> 352.40000000000003
ranty and cats and everybody's latching

350.72 --> 354.0
on to that and so over the flat earth

352.4 --> 357.59999999999997
debate it's just

354.0 --> 357.6
technical necessity i guess

357.919 --> 361.12
to latch on to that

365.52 --> 370.24
and yeah having a good conversation

367.44 --> 370.24
afterward too

370.88 --> 377.44
right also yeah tea time with gary terry

374.639 --> 377.44
own benjamin

378.84 --> 395.84
awesome as usual

405.28 --> 408.96
yeah i had a couple of confronting

407.6 --> 411.52000000000004
moments

408.96 --> 413.52
though and i hey that had that's i think

411.52 --> 415.52
it's supposed to happen

413.52 --> 416.71999999999997
home benjamin gets very confronting it's

415.52 --> 420.31899999999996
just like

416.72 --> 421.44000000000005
i'm used to it but sometimes it's like

420.319 --> 423.84000000000003
he

421.44 --> 424.88
follows a certain rhythm and then it's

423.84 --> 429.52
like almost

424.88 --> 432.639
the synchronicity gets kind of creepy

429.52 --> 434.08
because he literally says things exactly

432.639 --> 437.12
in the moment

434.08 --> 439.919
he basi thinks like

437.12 --> 440.96
like stop drinking like literally as i'm

439.919 --> 443.68
taking a sip

440.96 --> 444.15999999999997
right that sort of thing that and then

443.68 --> 447.36
just

444.16 --> 451.84000000000003
okay and then something else and then

447.36 --> 451.84000000000003
something and that can be kind of weird

453.199 --> 460.639
but it's also because for some reason

456.88 --> 464.319
that just really hits

460.639 --> 467.68
like i can't keep

464.319 --> 468.16
i'm stumbling a bit i don't know i had

467.68 --> 471.599
some

468.16 --> 475.36
weird sights saw some

471.599 --> 477.52
yeah people out there

475.36 --> 479.44
that kind of reminded like they had

477.52 --> 481.52
certain type of hours

479.44 --> 483.44
over them and that just really reminded

481.52 --> 486.79999999999995
me of back in the day

483.44 --> 488.639
with some other people and that really

486.8 --> 490.879
distracted me

488.639 --> 493.28000000000003
and i'm still kind of halfway distracted

490.879 --> 494.24
from that like remembering something

493.28 --> 496.78999999999996
that

494.24 --> 499.44
you kind of forget

496.79 --> 502.40000000000003
[Music]

499.44 --> 504.16
start puzzling over people and why why

502.4 --> 507.28
are they like this

504.16 --> 511.84000000000003
what does that really mean etc etc

507.28 --> 514.4789999999999
but hey sleeping warrior

511.84 --> 514.4789999999999
good morning

515.519 --> 519.919
so yeah that got me a bit flustered and

518.399 --> 522.159
i don't know if i'm going to be super

519.919 --> 524.399
focused today

522.159 --> 526.959
i'll try to do my best i'll probably get

524.399 --> 526.959
into it

533.44 --> 535.839
oh

548.0 --> 555.2
so what are you up to what's the

551.04 --> 555.1999999999999
your earliest memory you have of it as a

560.839 --> 567.44
child

563.44 --> 570.5600000000001
it it's environmental

567.44 --> 573.9200000000001
it's like places

570.56 --> 575.04
places i'm in are the first memories i

573.92 --> 576.959
have

575.04 --> 579.76
and i think i even have them from when

576.959 --> 582.4799999999999
it was like three

579.76 --> 583.68
but not people like not things i was

582.48 --> 587.9200000000001
doing it's just

583.68 --> 590.8
the place like i remember from like

587.92 --> 591.92
the first house where i was practically

590.8 --> 597.04
being born where i

591.92 --> 600.88
yeah where i arrived even though

597.04 --> 602.64
my parents left there when i was four

600.88 --> 604.079
and that's like really weird and every

602.64 --> 607.1999999999999
time there's

604.079 --> 609.92
a couple of pictures from there

607.2 --> 613.12
every time i see them it's like really

609.92 --> 617.12
jarring because it touches upon like

613.12 --> 620.5600000000001
well memories that are like

617.12 --> 621.6
people not inclusive with people it's

620.56 --> 625.279
just like

621.6 --> 629.279
the building for some reason

625.279 --> 633.04
from the inside and what it felt like

629.279 --> 634.88
like the energy and it is yeah so that

633.04 --> 637.1999999999999
that is pretty much the earliest memory

634.88 --> 637.2
i have

638.959 --> 642.3199999999999
oh hello one big pond

643.92 --> 650.4799999999999
and other than that

647.12 --> 652.5600000000001
very first memory well the the most

650.48 --> 653.12
elaborate memory is from when i was five

652.56 --> 655.5189999999999
and it's

653.12 --> 657.519
the the first really elaborate flying

655.519 --> 659.36
dream and it was so impressed by that it

657.519 --> 662.48
was all fulfilled and even talking about

659.36 --> 662.48
it to my parents and

663.68 --> 669.1999999999999
trying to they were trying to write down

666.72 --> 671.6
the story of it even but it it became

669.2 --> 673.6
completely messy and eventually made

671.6 --> 675.12
like because the dream had ended but i

673.6 --> 675.519
didn't want to stop and then i started

675.12 --> 677.92
to

675.519 --> 678.8
talk silly stuff with candy fantasy and

677.92 --> 681.8389999999999
all that

678.8 --> 684.88
yeah so but

681.839 --> 686.8800000000001
yeah that first part the real dream i

684.88 --> 688.88
will never forget that and that was when

686.88 --> 692.16
i was five i think

688.88 --> 693.6
and another memory is but it's because

692.16 --> 698.64
it's been emphasized

693.6 --> 698.64
so important early on was

698.72 --> 703.839
like philosophical statement

704.0 --> 708.24
god doesn't exist but he's there like

706.64 --> 711.68
wait i remember

708.24 --> 714.16
when i said that that was also when i

711.68 --> 714.16
was five

715.6 --> 721.76
right so but other than that

718.959 --> 724.6389999999999
just fragments fragments of like one

721.76 --> 727.279
time when i wanted to have a party

724.639 --> 728.399
birthday party but the atmosphere was

727.279 --> 730.88
not good

728.399 --> 732.56
and then it was like really crippled by

730.88 --> 736.24
that like i didn't understand

732.56 --> 744.959
like why is this not what i expected it

736.24 --> 747.279
that's a memory but uh

744.959 --> 749.3599999999999
i have more dream memories more dark

747.279 --> 752.0
world related dream memories from when i

749.36 --> 756.399
was really young than i do

752.0 --> 759.2
of actual 3d timeline based

756.399 --> 759.2
things that happen

761.04 --> 765.76
because the dreams also were very strong

763.36 --> 769.04
in between that

765.76 --> 773.8389999999999
but it didn't talk about any of that

769.04 --> 773.8389999999999
it's like

774.0 --> 781.33
right it's confusing anyway

778.25 --> 781.33
[Music]

784.32 --> 789.44
i have a childhood memory of being

785.839 --> 791.6800000000001
washed in laundry sink

789.44 --> 791.6800000000001
hmm

793.6 --> 801.839
that's funny

803.2 --> 808.72
it could be that i have a vague memory

805.6 --> 808.72
of such things too

809.279 --> 815.8389999999999
but that's just very fragmented

818.8 --> 826.16
it also because i don't know i've seen

822.88 --> 829.8389999999999
pictures of myself as a baby

826.16 --> 833.12
even when i was very young so it's tough

829.839 --> 834.9590000000001
to sometimes like unravel whether i was

833.12 --> 837.519
imagining what it was like and already

834.959 --> 843.76
being very good at that

837.519 --> 847.519
or if it was an actual in body memory

843.76 --> 850.8
because i have plenty of like

847.519 --> 850.8
i guess projections

851.199 --> 857.519
things that i've considered like putting

854.0 --> 861.12
actively putting together reconstructing

857.519 --> 864.16
what has happened and like how that

861.12 --> 867.839
fits in your head but like real

864.16 --> 867.8389999999999
live recording memories

869.36 --> 873.76
nah very little

874.079 --> 877.92
although i think that potentially i

876.0 --> 881.279
could really dig back there

877.92 --> 882.399
and just keep reconstructing it

881.279 --> 887.76
naturally

882.399 --> 887.76
but i don't know why do you ask

894.48 --> 902.24
if i ever moved anything with my mind no

899.44 --> 902.24
people maybe

905.519 --> 913.839
i might have moved other minds but have

907.6 --> 913.839
not moved physical things

924.24 --> 928.32
hey dutch sailor good to see you

928.959 --> 941.8389999999999
about rodriguez also huh

952.72 --> 955.839
nathan r

966.839 --> 972.48
hmm yeah slow mo moon buggy

969.839 --> 973.36
in dreams you have to concentrate to fly

972.48 --> 975.759
yeah i totally

973.36 --> 978.0
understand that's with me too it's

975.759 --> 983.839
something you have to activate

978.0 --> 983.839
like a push

985.759 --> 992.24
with me it's tied in with like

988.88 --> 997.8389999999999
bracing yourself in a very specific way

992.24 --> 997.839
that works

1001.6 --> 1006.16
like whatever is in my dreams supposed

1004.72 --> 1008.0790000000001
to be

1006.16 --> 1011.8389999999999
causing the floating i think it's

1008.079 --> 1011.8389999999999
emanating from my hands and feet

1020.399 --> 1025.6
do i think someone paid ranty off to be

1022.959 --> 1029.28
a baller again

1025.6 --> 1032.1599999999999
well not literally

1029.28 --> 1032.72
but yeah surely he has had plenty of

1032.16 --> 1036.16
offers

1032.72 --> 1039.28
from individuals like way back i

1036.16 --> 1041.3600000000001
i got all those kinds of offers a lot

1039.28 --> 1044.0
too or well not even offers it's just

1041.36 --> 1045.9189999999999
indirect people say oh you just got to

1044.0 --> 1046.4
get out of this flat earth and so you

1045.919 --> 1051.039
can make

1046.4 --> 1051.039
money again who knows

1051.12 --> 1055.12
right ranty has some connections that

1054.24 --> 1058.4
he's kind of

1055.12 --> 1060.9599999999998
bumped into and connected to so

1058.4 --> 1060.96
i don't know

1063.44 --> 1067.28
i think it's more likely that this is

1065.36 --> 1070.1599999999999
just another personal

1067.28 --> 1081.84
project of his something he wants to

1070.16 --> 1081.8400000000001
wants to try out

1082.48 --> 1086.96
maybe i think he's trolling blur first

1084.64 --> 1086.96
yes

1087.12 --> 1108.0
oh he's he's playing them

1095.44 --> 1109.919
like obviously

1108.0 --> 1113.28
but then again maybe he's playing

1109.919 --> 1113.2800000000002
himself in it as well

1114.24 --> 1118.48
maybe he's going into full undercover

1116.72 --> 1120.559
like even to himself

1118.48 --> 1122.16
i don't know what i don't know exactly

1120.559 --> 1125.9189999999999
what he's doing

1122.16 --> 1125.919
don't really care that much

1128.0 --> 1131.2
maybe just to get back at nathan and

1130.16 --> 1134.559
riley

1131.2 --> 1137.8400000000001
how how is that working

1134.559 --> 1137.84
david blackson

1140.72 --> 1144.0
oh hello by the way samson good to see

1142.559 --> 1151.84
you

1144.0 --> 1151.84
clutch bear

1162.84 --> 1165.84
so

1176.84 --> 1179.84
hmm

1184.4 --> 1188.64
who is that is that a person

1188.88 --> 1194.5590000000002
you know in the real world

1195.2 --> 1198.96
started talking about the north that's

1197.12 --> 1202.0
just hilarious

1198.96 --> 1205.44
let me guess he he said but

1202.0 --> 1209.44
if the north star is in the middle

1205.44 --> 1211.919
then why can't you see it everywhere

1209.44 --> 1213.2
i'll bet she said he tried suggesting

1211.919 --> 1216.7990000000002
that right

1213.2 --> 1216.799
oh it's just a troll okay

1219.28 --> 1223.52
he was spamming on one of my videos oh

1221.36 --> 1224.4799999999998
god you actually look at the comment

1223.52 --> 1226.4
sections

1224.48 --> 1229.84
like the trolls are really getting in

1226.4 --> 1232.4
there again i don't know why

1229.84 --> 1234.0
every time i take a look i end up just

1232.4 --> 1238.159
throwing a whole bunch of

1234.0 --> 1238.159
in a way because it's just pure at home

1243.31 --> 1246.54
[Music]

1246.84 --> 1249.84
garbage

1250.98 --> 1258.96
[Music]

1253.6 --> 1263.84
you do wake up as much as i can

1258.96 --> 1267.1200000000001
well you mean wake up yourself

1263.84 --> 1268.08
because that's probably the most

1267.12 --> 1271.76
important thing

1268.08 --> 1274.559
right it's like

1271.76 --> 1276.1589999999999
hey if you figure out the earth is flat

1274.559 --> 1277.84
that's only the beginning

1276.159 --> 1280.24
because then you got to unravel

1277.84 --> 1282.3999999999999
everything else as well

1280.24 --> 1283.84
right it's important that you understand

1282.4 --> 1286.64
how things work

1283.84 --> 1288.559
what is true and what is not and what to

1286.64 --> 1292.48
actually pay attention to

1288.559 --> 1295.9189999999999
within all of it and only then

1292.48 --> 1298.96
can you test others to see if

1295.919 --> 1300.96
if they can approach you to the same

1298.96 --> 1303.6000000000001
level

1300.96 --> 1305.52
and that's difficult i talked to oh yeah

1303.6 --> 1308.32
i almost forgot yeah i went on 24 7

1305.52 --> 1308.32
discord a little

1311.84 --> 1318.0
i talked about that because someone

1314.88 --> 1319.8400000000001
that wasn't just weird this guy was

1318.0 --> 1321.76
just saying like oh the bible's the

1319.84 --> 1324.0
solution to everything then he basically

1321.76 --> 1326.32
used some quote

1324.0 --> 1327.6
and made a statement about that that

1326.32 --> 1330.8799999999999
didn't match

1327.6 --> 1332.8799999999999
this yeah this his statement didn't

1330.88 --> 1333.7600000000002
match the quote in my opinion and then i

1332.88 --> 1336.4
asked

1333.76 --> 1337.919
basically let's explore this quote from

1336.4 --> 1341.039
the bible

1337.919 --> 1343.919
and then he went away apparently he was

1341.039 --> 1347.6
afraid to do that

1343.919 --> 1351.2
that was weird but i was basically just

1347.6 --> 1354.32
inputting info on how i regard

1351.2 --> 1357.28
people should test others

1354.32 --> 1358.799
carefully to see how much of the reality

1357.28 --> 1362.3999999999999
they can handle and that

1358.799 --> 1366.1589999999999
probably with every subject right first

1362.4 --> 1366.159
you just test people's interests

1366.24 --> 1372.72
then you test their skill depth

1369.6 --> 1375.84
on the subjects that they focus on and

1372.72 --> 1379.3600000000001
then you

1375.84 --> 1381.76
see like how much subjects might

1379.36 --> 1383.84
trigger or scare them without making it

1381.76 --> 1387.76
the subject yet

1383.84 --> 1392.24
letting it slip past right in it

1387.76 --> 1394.0
summary of things you put something that

1392.24 --> 1395.679
that's how we do it like in the summary

1394.0 --> 1398.4
of conspiracy

1395.679 --> 1399.52
ideas that are typical that's where i

1398.4 --> 1402.799
might choose to

1399.52 --> 1404.32
throw the flat earth in there right and

1402.799 --> 1408.32
if you throw it in a list

1404.32 --> 1411.84
then people can like if it's too hot to

1408.32 --> 1411.84
handle they'll just ignore it

1412.4 --> 1417.2800000000002
or they might get triggered but if it's

1415.6 --> 1419.52
in a list then you can just throw it to

1417.28 --> 1422.08
the side you can choose to address it

1419.52 --> 1424.48
however you like based on their response

1422.08 --> 1424.48
anyway

1427.6 --> 1431.84
you have to wake up yourself every day

1434.55 --> 1437.8
[Music]

1447.52 --> 1453.84
just because he was the one

1450.72 --> 1458.24
that basically started nathan's show

1453.84 --> 1460.6399999999999
oh really

1458.24 --> 1461.679
are you talking what you're talking

1460.64 --> 1463.76
about ranty

1461.679 --> 1466.0
you're saying that ranty made nathan's

1463.76 --> 1466.0
show

1470.84 --> 1473.84
wow

1475.52 --> 1479.12
but what about nathan

1479.2 --> 1482.88
i think that he's the one that actually

1481.84 --> 1485.279
did the show

1482.88 --> 1487.2
now ranty has done a lot of

1485.279 --> 1490.48
presentations

1487.2 --> 1492.72
especially when he first came on

1490.48 --> 1495.2
he brought a lot of inter yeah he really

1492.72 --> 1497.84
kind of brought the p900 and

1495.2 --> 1499.52
that sort of thing early on on the scene

1497.84 --> 1501.52
a couple of others too and he was just

1499.52 --> 1505.2
very successful with it first and then

1501.52 --> 1505.2
tony also joined in and

1506.24 --> 1509.039
another people

1512.84 --> 1518.1589999999999
but

1514.88 --> 1521.279
that doesn't make ranty the one

1518.159 --> 1522.48
that started nathan's show nathan was

1521.279 --> 1524.88
doing

1522.48 --> 1526.24
a lot of shows way before the flat earth

1524.88 --> 1529.0390000000002
debates

1526.24 --> 1530.96
so that's it's kind of a silly thing to

1529.039 --> 1536.08
say

1530.96 --> 1536.08
also weirdo narcissist how does that

1540.84 --> 1543.84
work

1553.44 --> 1558.24
grantee actually set up all the youtube

1556.0 --> 1571.84
stuff in the beginning

1558.24 --> 1571.84
what do you mean

1584.64 --> 1591.8400000000001
oh dan didn't know how oh well

1587.84 --> 1593.9189999999999
no that's that makes him the bad man

1591.84 --> 1596.08
okay yeah randy might have helped him

1593.919 --> 1598.48
out with the youtube

1596.08 --> 1601.36
the the google hangouts and all that in

1598.48 --> 1604.64
the beginning it was quite a chaos right

1601.36 --> 1607.76
so that means it's

1604.64 --> 1611.2
ranty show really does it

1607.76 --> 1613.84
is it because

1611.2 --> 1615.039
that idea and i i don't know who you are

1613.84 --> 1618.32
david blackson

1615.039 --> 1622.4
for all i know you could be a ranty sock

1618.32 --> 1622.3999999999999
sounds kind of narcissistic

1622.799 --> 1627.44
to claim that just because ranty helped

1626.08 --> 1631.4399999999998
nathan in the beginning

1627.44 --> 1634.88
set up some technicals for a while

1631.44 --> 1637.8400000000001
that nathan has all of his success

1634.88 --> 1638.24
thanks to ranty that that seems kind of

1637.84 --> 1642.32
like

1638.24 --> 1642.32
egotistical and narcissistic to me

1644.0 --> 1647.679
to say that i i don't know what what

1646.88 --> 1655.8400000000001
else

1647.679 --> 1655.8400000000001
the rest in chat thinks about that

1658.559 --> 1661.76
oh she was supposed to be flattered but

1660.799 --> 1666.6399999999999
turned into

1661.76 --> 1669.84
one in one of irwin's hangouts

1666.64 --> 1670.64
all right was it because of his wife

1669.84 --> 1674.6399999999999
really i

1670.64 --> 1675.919
i don't remember i just know i was

1674.64 --> 1683.8400000000001
really disgusted

1675.919 --> 1683.8400000000001
by jose when that happened

1683.919 --> 1687.919
i'm dallas david okay you're not a ranty

1686.72 --> 1691.44
sock okay

1687.919 --> 1694.64
that's fine but yeah

1691.44 --> 1698.64
sure ranty has a lot of grudges

1694.64 --> 1698.64
as a grudge towards me

1699.12 --> 1705.1999999999998
at plenty of people out there

1705.679 --> 1725.8400000000001
that's typically what yeah

1709.039 --> 1725.84
people like that have

1736.84 --> 1739.84
so

1745.2 --> 1748.799
people could stand for truth every

1747.12 --> 1752.6399999999999
single day of their lives

1748.799 --> 1756.0
what well just live

1752.64 --> 1760.7990000000002
the truth live through it

1756.0 --> 1762.72
right unfortunately there will always be

1760.799 --> 1764.799
people that are not going to accept the

1762.72 --> 1766.32
truth out there as well

1764.799 --> 1768.559
and they're gonna say that you're the

1766.32 --> 1768.559
one

1769.36 --> 1772.7199999999998
that doesn't accept their truth even

1771.679 --> 1774.88
though when you test

1772.72 --> 1781.84
their truth it's not much of a truth

1774.88 --> 1781.8400000000001
it's just dogma

1783.279 --> 1789.2
right and whatever you're gonna conclude

1787.2 --> 1793.279
about

1789.2 --> 1795.3600000000001
what their stance is as soon as you

1793.279 --> 1797.2
share that it will immediately be

1795.36 --> 1798.24
projected back on you and that's what

1797.2 --> 1800.32
they'll say about you

1798.24 --> 1802.48
that's yeah that's what happens it's

1800.32 --> 1809.84
what the devil does

1802.48 --> 1809.84
the reversed world

1816.48 --> 1823.84
anyway where's everybody going

1831.44 --> 1837.8400000000001
hey james maze good to see you

1840.08 --> 1844.8799999999999
okay slow mo moon buggy i missed this

1842.799 --> 1846.6399999999999
earlier i have a theory that gets people

1844.88 --> 1850.3200000000002
upset when i mention it

1846.64 --> 1853.039
what theory is that hey samson

1850.32 --> 1853.039
listening okay

1859.2 --> 1862.559
what do you think sent ranty over the

1861.279 --> 1866.96
edge to stick

1862.559 --> 1866.96
it too flat earth with such bogus photos

1871.76 --> 1874.08
well

1875.039 --> 1880.32
ranty just has this kind of bad social

1878.32 --> 1881.6
habit that he likes to play with

1880.32 --> 1884.1589999999999
people's

1881.6 --> 1885.279
feelings and minds likes to play them as

1884.159 --> 1888.3990000000001
you call it

1885.279 --> 1892.08
and i think that he just saw too much

1888.399 --> 1894.9599999999998
potential on the baller side but because

1892.08 --> 1897.84
he was a flat earther they would never

1894.96 --> 1897.8400000000001
listen to him

1898.399 --> 1901.6
right now we're always trying to get him

1899.84 --> 1903.76
on their side so i think that

1901.6 --> 1906.48
he might just like the ballers more

1903.76 --> 1908.24
because they're more easily influenced

1906.48 --> 1911.76
and they're more impressed and more

1908.24 --> 1915.039
worshippy alike

1911.76 --> 1915.039
i think that may be it

1916.159 --> 1924.3200000000002
he wants to be more than just

1921.279 --> 1927.76
what he is a guy

1924.32 --> 1931.039
he likes the attention he likes to be

1927.76 --> 1934.37
put on a pedestal and people

1931.039 --> 1936.559
talking in awe about him

1934.37 --> 1939.6789999999999
[Music]

1936.559 --> 1941.36
and defending him and attacking for him

1939.679 --> 1948.3990000000001
in other chats and all that he likes

1941.36 --> 1950.399
that stuff

1948.399 --> 1962.799
i think grant is unequivocal argument

1950.399 --> 1965.1999999999998
and used it to see how global

1962.799 --> 1966.0
okay that's that's kind of a strange

1965.2 --> 1967.6000000000001
theory there

1966.0 --> 1969.519
sleeping warrior oh by the way thank you

1967.6 --> 1977.84
james mays for the 20

1969.519 --> 1977.84
super chat donation that's very nice

1979.12 --> 1995.039
james mason also in chat

1991.76 --> 1997.12
right yeah the jumping ship effect it's

1995.039 --> 2000.48
weird to me man like maybe there is

1997.12 --> 2000.4799999999998
something like that going on

2000.799 --> 2008.0
like to encourage the ballers

2004.72 --> 2010.64
they just try to find flat earthers

2008.0 --> 2012.399
to convert for some reason and they have

2010.64 --> 2015.519
to have like somebody

2012.399 --> 2015.5189999999998
that's doing that

2016.88 --> 2022.5590000000002
in order to retain

2019.919 --> 2024.0800000000002
that idea that c flat earth is failing

2022.559 --> 2027.279
and

2024.08 --> 2027.279
like a political stun

2028.24 --> 2034.3990000000001
but yeah

2031.44 --> 2036.72
if you're going to be part of that like

2034.399 --> 2036.7199999999998
that's

2036.799 --> 2039.9189999999999
yeah that's really just burning bridges

2038.88 --> 2041.44
in way if you're

2039.919 --> 2043.3600000000001
actually going to be a flat earther

2041.44 --> 2044.64
that's part of that everybody that's

2043.36 --> 2049.2
done that

2044.64 --> 2049.2000000000003
has had issues because of it

2050.0 --> 2057.599
just you could see it they all change

2054.639 --> 2057.599
not for the better

2058.079 --> 2061.8390000000004
ship jumper

2066.159 --> 2075.839
someone paid him off well yeah

2069.76 --> 2075.8390000000004
could be

2077.119 --> 2082.7200000000003
maybe somebody did just had him a big

2080.24 --> 2084.56
a yeah a big amount of money to say like

2082.72 --> 2088.56
okay you gotta do this now

2084.56 --> 2090.32
and then you'll baby has dead sirs i

2088.56 --> 2092.0
don't know about ranty's financial

2090.32 --> 2103.839
situation i don't know what he

2092.0 --> 2103.839
does out there

2111.68 --> 2120.56
a planted ship jumper

2116.88 --> 2120.56
right well he might just be

2120.72 --> 2124.72
doing that and he might at some point

2123.44 --> 2126.64
decide to say

2124.72 --> 2128.3199999999997
to basically come out with it and say

2126.64 --> 2132.3199999999997
like yeah

2128.32 --> 2135.839
i literally did do it for money

2132.32 --> 2135.839
and i fulfilled you

2136.56 --> 2141.359
could be i don't know what he's gonna do

2138.72 --> 2141.359
man this

2141.68 --> 2145.839
is it really important

2149.44 --> 2154.079
private hernia operations what

2156.079 --> 2159.8390000000004
did he have that

2178.079 --> 2187.8390000000004
the man has compromising picture really

2181.359 --> 2187.839
like what

2222.8 --> 2228.48
who is going to pay rentie well who

2225.359 --> 2232.24
knows maybe

2228.48 --> 2235.839
uh ruhif or something

2232.24 --> 2239.04
i think he's done that before so

2235.839 --> 2243.839
could be could be that ruiff

2239.04 --> 2247.839
just handed him some money or whatever

2243.839 --> 2251.68
like okay you help us out with this

2247.839 --> 2253.52
who knows dangle the pint in front

2251.68 --> 2257.839
now i think it takes a little more than

2253.52 --> 2257.839
just a pint

2266.48 --> 2271.04
every flat earther knows he's full of

2269.2 --> 2274.8799999999997
crap really

2271.04 --> 2276.72
why play this game well because

2274.88 --> 2285.839
it's not for the flat earthers i think

2276.72 --> 2285.839
it really is to play the ballers

2305.359 --> 2316.72
their first two right

2313.599 --> 2316.7200000000003
yeah tiny momo

2318.079 --> 2323.119
no because it makes no sense because

2321.28 --> 2325.119
you know tiny boy you probably just

2323.119 --> 2326.96
don't understand you can't make yourself

2325.119 --> 2332.0
understand

2326.96 --> 2332.0
randy's already argued arguments

2332.48 --> 2338.8
that he's repeated

2335.599 --> 2343.2000000000003
that basically already undo everything

2338.8 --> 2345.3590000000004
he's said recently so he's already

2343.2 --> 2346.64
undone his own the arguments that he's

2345.359 --> 2350.48
making

2346.64 --> 2352.72
right that makes no sense

2350.48 --> 2355.28
it's not like oh he doesn't understand

2352.72 --> 2358.0
he's making a mistake no he's already

2355.28 --> 2369.8390000000004
refuted these things

2358.0 --> 2369.839
that he's literally doing

2375.28 --> 2379.599
what do i think about randy's picture

2377.2 --> 2381.839
well it's not really randy's picture

2379.599 --> 2382.88
somebody else's but yeah it's a black

2381.839 --> 2397.839
swan it's

2382.88 --> 2397.839
very flat very very flat

2408.839 --> 2411.839
hmm

2414.64 --> 2425.839
hello rob h what kevin gardner print i

2418.0 --> 2425.839
don't know what that is

2436.839 --> 2439.839
hmm

2461.22 --> 2464.35
[Music]

2464.839 --> 2467.839
hmm

2468.47 --> 2471.83
[Music]

2482.16 --> 2495.839
yes indeed sleeping warrior i agree

2485.599 --> 2495.839
it's it's remarkable

2504.88 --> 2509.359
right well david blackson there you go

2506.88 --> 2511.52
now you have a motive see

2509.359 --> 2513.2
that's exactly what randy wanted

2511.52 --> 2515.28
probably

2513.2 --> 2516.64
because hey if they're in love with him

2515.28 --> 2519.599
as you say it then

2516.64 --> 2523.359
they're very playable they're yeah you

2519.599 --> 2525.76
can basically

2523.359 --> 2527.839
make them do all kinds of things with

2525.76 --> 2537.8390000000004
much less effort

2527.839 --> 2537.839
right so that supports my theory

2547.04 --> 2550.079
there's very limited information

2549.28 --> 2555.119
regarding

2550.079 --> 2555.119
focalt the pendulum guy

2562.839 --> 2565.839
what

2567.76 --> 2571.8390000000004
link to the black bull picture okay

2572.079 --> 2574.48
all right

2575.119 --> 2593.839
i'll try to find it to present it

2579.2 --> 2593.839
should be somewhere on on skype

2618.839 --> 2635.839
what

2620.96 --> 2635.839
where is it

2648.56 --> 2651.2
this the one

2659.28 --> 2663.8390000000004
yeah it's still a cut out

2663.92 --> 2668.48
can you explain why the mountains are

2665.839 --> 2670.7999999999997
lower than the tower perspective

2668.48 --> 2677.839
they're smaller have a smaller angular

2670.8 --> 2677.8390000000004
size because they're much further away

2688.839 --> 2691.839
what

2697.28 --> 2705.8390000000004
what are you rob h what

2711.52 --> 2719.839
what prince i don't know what you're

2713.599 --> 2719.839
talking about rabbits

2720.64 --> 2726.16
this should still be higher well

2724.0 --> 2726.16
no

2729.28 --> 2736.1600000000003
right also why why would that be

2733.04 --> 2739.2
well because the island is it

2736.16 --> 2741.2
it's like an island or like a sub-island

2739.2 --> 2744.48
when you call that

2741.2 --> 2747.1189999999997
it's surrounded by water water

2744.48 --> 2748.4
will dissolve in the air so that's

2747.119 --> 2753.04
typically going to

2748.4 --> 2753.04
have like different conditions

2753.44 --> 2758.2400000000002
yet there's more than just the angular

2756.96 --> 2760.88
size

2758.24 --> 2762.8799999999997
right if that's already taken into

2760.88 --> 2763.2000000000003
account there can be weather effects

2762.88 --> 2766.1600000000003
like

2763.2 --> 2768.24
moist in the air so i think i heard

2766.16 --> 2771.1189999999997
somebody argue about this

2768.24 --> 2771.4399999999996
i think it was sleeping word that some

2771.119 --> 2775.6800000000003
of

2771.44 --> 2777.839
blackpool might be slightly stretched up

2775.68 --> 2781.5989999999997
because of refraction effect the moist

2777.839 --> 2781.599
in the air and the mountains are not

2783.44 --> 2790.56
right because oh they should be smaller

2786.88 --> 2795.04
or you base

2790.56 --> 2798.24
how big they are on how big you see

2795.04 --> 2802.4
what is it blackpool

2798.24 --> 2804.72
and then notice like hey it's supposedly

2802.4 --> 2807.76
bigger

2804.72 --> 2807.7599999999998
than the mountains

2808.16 --> 2812.3999999999996
is that because the mountains are not

2810.0 --> 2815.359
big enough or is it because

2812.4 --> 2818.56
yeah your cross-reference blackpool is

2815.359 --> 2818.56
slightly stretched up

2819.92 --> 2831.839
because of a refraction effect

2823.52 --> 2831.839
or towering or what is it called

2833.119 --> 2844.319
angular resolution no

2836.8 --> 2849.52
no that's only why the bottom disappears

2844.319 --> 2849.52
should be higher no no they shouldn't

2854.319 --> 2859.04
one can argue that blackpool should be

2856.96 --> 2873.839
lower

2859.04 --> 2873.839
mountains should not be higher

2893.24 --> 2896.54
[Music]

2900.0 --> 2905.359
right so since we're talking about this

2903.2 --> 2907.68
tony would you like me to call you in on

2905.359 --> 2907.68
skype

2909.04 --> 2913.52
because i am not too much into the

2912.0 --> 2915.839
details of this thing

2913.52 --> 2915.839
right

2918.96 --> 2923.359
like even last time with the isle of man

2921.92 --> 2925.28
situation

2923.359 --> 2927.44
while you guys were all like oh the

2925.28 --> 2928.48
calculations of this and that and all

2927.44 --> 2931.599
this

2928.48 --> 2933.52
oh it should not be like that and i was

2931.599 --> 2934.079
more focusing on just trying to figure

2933.52 --> 2937.359
out like

2934.079 --> 2938.88
how does site work how what am i

2937.359 --> 2942.0789999999997
actually seeing how

2938.88 --> 2944.2400000000002
am i mentally interpreting this

2942.079 --> 2945.28
and like how does this work so during

2944.24 --> 2949.2799999999997
that whole period

2945.28 --> 2952.079
i had devised the optical slant

2949.28 --> 2953.8390000000004
remember that that came out of the isle

2952.079 --> 2955.92
of man for me

2953.839 --> 2957.92
well everybody was all trying to use the

2955.92 --> 2960.88
curvature calculator and all that

2957.92 --> 2961.76
figure it out and eventually autographic

2960.88 --> 2964.88
view

2961.76 --> 2967.8390000000004
was discovered that they're secretly

2964.88 --> 2971.2000000000003
applying an excluding perspective

2967.839 --> 2971.7599999999998
i in that time was trying to just figure

2971.2 --> 2974.7999999999997
out like

2971.76 --> 2975.5200000000004
how does seeing things actually work how

2974.8 --> 2979.119
do you

2975.52 --> 2984.16
interpret what you see

2979.119 --> 2989.6800000000003
and i came up with the optical slants

2984.16 --> 2989.68
right i certainly present that i made it

2996.839 --> 3002.24
myself

2998.4 --> 3004.319
ah just gonna slam it over the

3002.24 --> 3006.0
over the ark so it's gonna look garbage

3004.319 --> 3013.839
but yeah

3006.0 --> 3013.839
here it is

3017.359 --> 3022.4
that's basically what i got out of it

3020.0 --> 3026.24
and this is before

3022.4 --> 3028.1600000000003
like more detailed optics experts also

3026.24 --> 3032.16
came on the scene

3028.16 --> 3032.16
like life is short

3038.319 --> 3044.5589999999997
right so to quickly go through it

3041.599 --> 3044.559
optical slant

3044.64 --> 3049.2799999999997
caused by the fraction end of sight

3046.8 --> 3052.88
caused by refraction the blurring up the

3049.28 --> 3055.76
blurring up is eventually always

3052.88 --> 3057.2000000000003
what causes you to not see further

3055.76 --> 3060.2400000000002
besides

3057.2 --> 3062.3999999999996
angular size due to distance right

3060.24 --> 3064.24
because eventually angular resolution

3062.4 --> 3068.0
limit will also make

3064.24 --> 3071.52
objects just too small

3068.0 --> 3071.52
like get a [ __ ] life dude

3074.559 --> 3083.8390000000004
get a [ __ ] life dude

3084.72 --> 3087.1189999999997
right

3088.079 --> 3093.2000000000003
angular size will also prevent you from

3091.2 --> 3094.8799999999997
seeing objects because you simply don't

3093.2 --> 3096.0
have the resolution to pick it up and

3094.88 --> 3099.2000000000003
then one could argue

3096.0 --> 3101.52
you could take giant telescope

3099.2 --> 3103.1189999999997
aim it at the horizon and then that

3101.52 --> 3106.48
specific problem would be

3103.119 --> 3108.48
resolved but then inevitably

3106.48 --> 3110.16
there would still be an end of sight

3108.48 --> 3112.96
because by refraction the

3110.16 --> 3114.96
ponder the preponderance of all the

3112.96 --> 3117.68
gases

3114.96 --> 3118.079
you're looking through and the moist in

3117.68 --> 3120.7999999999997
there

3118.079 --> 3123.04
and even if it's dry there will still

3120.8 --> 3126.1600000000003
technically be a limit to that

3123.04 --> 3129.2
eventually just the sheer amount of air

3126.16 --> 3132.319
over incredible distances will always

3129.2 --> 3135.839
result in a blur up blur up of

3132.319 --> 3138.24
everything that's what i discovered but

3135.839 --> 3139.599
then the optical slant was also revealed

3138.24 --> 3143.2
things start to

3139.599 --> 3144.88
seemingly obstruct but rather it's

3143.2 --> 3147.9199999999996
conceal

3144.88 --> 3149.359
things behind them due to the angular

3147.92 --> 3151.76
resolution limit that's

3149.359 --> 3154.319
what generally is now tied in with that

3151.76 --> 3157.76
angular resolution limit

3154.319 --> 3159.92
and this is happens inherent to optics

3157.76 --> 3162.079
and can be demonstrated with proved

3159.92 --> 3165.04
measured flat surfaces

3162.079 --> 3166.8
if the observation height is low enough

3165.04 --> 3170.64
to the surface

3166.8 --> 3171.6800000000003
then yeah at some point the optical

3170.64 --> 3176.5589999999997
slant effect

3171.68 --> 3179.04
will happen and it will cause yeah

3176.559 --> 3180.0
an optical slant to appear and things

3179.04 --> 3183.04
behind that will

3180.0 --> 3185.68
be partially obscured

3183.04 --> 3186.48
even though literally it's perfectly

3185.68 --> 3188.5589999999997
flat

3186.48 --> 3189.92
right i call that the optical slant

3188.559 --> 3191.76
effect and hey the higher the

3189.92 --> 3195.839
observation height the further away the

3191.76 --> 3195.8390000000004
optical slant effect starts

3198.24 --> 3203.68
right and after that point also is when

3200.8 --> 3205.44
the typical miraging can happen

3203.68 --> 3206.72
because before the optical slant there

3205.44 --> 3209.2000000000003
is no miraging

3206.72 --> 3210.319
it's never close by it's always far away

3209.2 --> 3212.319
beyond that point

3210.319 --> 3214.24
where things can get concealed and

3212.319 --> 3216.48
warped

3214.24 --> 3217.68
right so this is what came out of it you

3216.48 --> 3219.52
have to feel the view

3217.68 --> 3221.7599999999998
up until the optical slant point and

3219.52 --> 3223.52
after that is the miraging zoid until

3221.76 --> 3226.48
the end of sight

3223.52 --> 3228.4
with blur up and this is the diagram

3226.48 --> 3231.359
that came out of that

3228.4 --> 3233.359
out of like a year of just looking at

3231.359 --> 3237.839
things and

3233.359 --> 3237.839
yeah i'm kind of proud of that

3271.96 --> 3279.28
trigonometry allows for perspective

3276.839 --> 3282.24
really

3279.28 --> 3282.2400000000002
that's hilarious

3286.72 --> 3290.16
yeah you know but technically you're

3289.2 --> 3292.799
correct

3290.16 --> 3294.0789999999997
when either of the following is

3292.799 --> 3297.7599999999998
confirmed

3294.079 --> 3301.76
and that is either the literal size

3297.76 --> 3307.2000000000003
or the literal exact distance

3301.76 --> 3309.599
and then you can apply trigonometry

3307.2 --> 3311.4399999999996
but yeah guess what celestial bodies up

3309.599 --> 3314.079
there and all that

3311.44 --> 3316.16
you can't have either you don't have a

3314.079 --> 3317.04
exact confirmed distance and you don't

3316.16 --> 3319.359
have an exact

3317.04 --> 3321.839
confirmed size like actual size not

3319.359 --> 3324.96
angular size

3321.839 --> 3326.24
right this is the mistake with celestial

3324.96 --> 3335.839
trigonometry

3326.24 --> 3335.839
presupposing the ball earth

3336.0 --> 3341.2
but yeah when it comes to trigonometry

3338.0 --> 3341.2
in the real world

3341.359 --> 3345.359
yeah that can work if you have an exact

3344.24 --> 3348.799
size

3345.359 --> 3351.839
or an exact distance you can

3348.799 --> 3355.68
try use trigonometry to

3351.839 --> 3359.2
figure it out but yeah they're still

3355.68 --> 3362.16
optics effects refraction

3359.2 --> 3363.7599999999998
moist conditions that still applies

3362.16 --> 3365.92
especially when you're trying to

3363.76 --> 3368.4
triangulate

3365.92 --> 3370.799
something that's really far away that

3368.4 --> 3372.319
basically beyond the optical slant point

3370.799 --> 3373.839
into the miraging zone

3372.319 --> 3376.24
then you have to account for that and

3373.839 --> 3381.2
that makes things very difficult

3376.24 --> 3381.2
to get an exact right

3385.2 --> 3391.839
triangulation only really works well

3388.079 --> 3391.8390000000004
within the standard field of view

3393.52 --> 3405.839
because then it's not subjected by any

3395.359 --> 3405.839
weird refraction

3406.16 --> 3409.1189999999997
hey chaminator

3416.839 --> 3419.839
ah

3425.76 --> 3428.96
wow pseudo-reality you're still thinking

3428.4 --> 3432.079
bob

3428.96 --> 3447.839
that's just sad

3432.079 --> 3447.8390000000004
that's just sad dude

3455.76 --> 3464.0
but don't be sad because on a flat earth

3461.359 --> 3466.72
you can still imagine the globe there

3464.0 --> 3469.52
was always a possibility right

3466.72 --> 3470.24
you get the choice the creator gives you

3469.52 --> 3473.839
choice

3470.24 --> 3475.2799999999997
choice to accept reality the truth god

3473.839 --> 3478.96
or to reject it

3475.28 --> 3480.799
and wander off into your own primitive

3478.96 --> 3488.16
constructions or whatever

3480.799 --> 3490.319
constructions were handed to you

3488.16 --> 3492.16
right nobody's going to take away your

3490.319 --> 3494.48
globe belief if that's what you want to

3492.16 --> 3494.48
believe

3496.0 --> 3500.96
but at the same time nobody's going to

3498.48 --> 3504.0
take away flat earth

3500.96 --> 3505.76
like even if it would get back for some

3504.0 --> 3507.599
reason to a point where you can't even

3505.76 --> 3510.96
talk about it anymore

3507.599 --> 3512.559
it's still flat it's just that

3510.96 --> 3514.4
you would have reached a point where you

3512.559 --> 3515.28
certainly can't even speak about it

3514.4 --> 3518.559
anymore

3515.28 --> 3521.6800000000003
which would be a bad sign right but it's

3518.559 --> 3521.6800000000003
still gonna be flat

3522.799 --> 3528.64
right this is not like political opinion

3526.319 --> 3528.64
war

3529.28 --> 3534.079
flat earth is not an opinion the globe

3531.839 --> 3536.799
is not an opinion

3534.079 --> 3537.92
flat earth is truth the globe is a

3536.799 --> 3541.44
machination

3537.92 --> 3543.839
it can be proven to be imagination

3541.44 --> 3545.839
from every angle it's pretty unique that

3543.839 --> 3547.7599999999998
way and if you can't accept that then

3545.839 --> 3550.64
you literally have no

3547.76 --> 3552.559
grip on reality and what actually

3550.64 --> 3555.5989999999997
consists

3552.559 --> 3559.2000000000003
of reality like what it consists of like

3555.599 --> 3561.44
how you actually recognize it

3559.2 --> 3561.4399999999996
so

3562.96 --> 3566.799
you can chant all day long like some

3566.24 --> 3570.16
kind of

3566.799 --> 3573.839
yeah political group it's not gonna make

3570.16 --> 3573.839
it true

3581.85 --> 3585.159
[Music]

3587.44 --> 3589.839
wow

3590.799 --> 3593.92
yeah i do actually have a full head of

3593.359 --> 3596.0789999999997
hair

3593.92 --> 3597.599
that's right see see that that's all

3596.079 --> 3600.799
mine

3597.599 --> 3604.6400000000003
this is my hair yeah it's real it's

3600.799 --> 3607.52
real hair so real i know

3604.64 --> 3608.96
frustrating isn't it yeah and it's not

3607.52 --> 3612.0
absolutely

3608.96 --> 3615.52
perfect but

3612.0 --> 3619.28
i'm 41 years old

3615.52 --> 3623.28
right i'm not bald

3619.28 --> 3626.6400000000003
never gonna be bald maybe when i'm

3623.28 --> 3627.3590000000004
like 70 at some point for some reason or

3626.64 --> 3631.04
something

3627.359 --> 3633.2799999999997
right because my dad has had great hair

3631.04 --> 3636.72
to a different style

3633.28 --> 3638.96
and he still kind of lost a bit of it

3636.72 --> 3642.48
but he still has it though

3638.96 --> 3645.52
and he is like almost 70.

3642.48 --> 3649.599
right so i'm doing all right i'm not

3645.52 --> 3649.599
even insecure about my hair anymore

3650.4 --> 3657.2000000000003
like really so keep chanting that

3654.16 --> 3660.24
you know it's not gonna help

3657.2 --> 3664.16
i've had this hair

3660.24 --> 3668.8799999999997
since i was 12 right

3664.16 --> 3671.839
that's 29 years of having long hair

3668.88 --> 3671.839
just like this

3673.28 --> 3676.88
right and it's decent it's never really

3675.52 --> 3680.16
gotten longer

3676.88 --> 3685.839
longer than this right but

3680.16 --> 3685.839
still yeah that's not bad

3686.799 --> 3699.839
it's real though it's all real

3704.4 --> 3707.52
it's weird when guys care about what

3706.319 --> 3709.119
other guy's hair

3707.52 --> 3713.839
looks like yeah that's right because

3709.119 --> 3713.839
they're gay

3736.96 --> 3742.079
yes clutch bear because what

3745.68 --> 3749.44
i just think it's funny because other

3748.96 --> 3751.599
people

3749.44 --> 3753.359
like even in the real world people have

3751.599 --> 3755.2000000000003
kind of tried to do that to me but

3753.359 --> 3756.0789999999997
sometimes i think that there's just

3755.2 --> 3759.2799999999997
people out there

3756.079 --> 3760.96
that like bald men like it when

3759.28 --> 3763.2000000000003
guys shave their head completely just

3760.96 --> 3765.52
they get off on it or something

3763.2 --> 3767.7599999999998
so they might just be projecting right

3765.52 --> 3771.28
just like gays can be projecting

3767.76 --> 3773.2000000000003
like no you are gay like no i'm not

3771.28 --> 3774.6400000000003
and they're like no you're balding you

3773.2 --> 3777.839
have to do it and i'm like

3774.64 --> 3777.839
no no i'm not

3778.319 --> 3783.839
something like that

3785.44 --> 3789.76
i don't know what that is i guess some

3788.16 --> 3793.839
people just like it bald

3789.76 --> 3798.88
i don't i like hair

3793.839 --> 3798.88
although right that's enough info

3800.559 --> 3811.119
like you don't have to have a hair

3802.24 --> 3825.5989999999997
everywhere if you know what i mean

3811.119 --> 3828.7200000000003
dude got nothing better

3825.599 --> 3829.28
talk about ranty and the future of flat

3828.72 --> 3830.5589999999997
earth

3829.28 --> 3832.96
what does that have to do with one

3830.559 --> 3832.96
another

3833.359 --> 3836.799
so what do you mean the future of flat

3835.2 --> 3839.2
earth as in

3836.799 --> 3841.44
the flat earth realization in the world

3839.2 --> 3841.4399999999996
or

3841.68 --> 3847.839
the knowledge that is gathered by flat

3844.799 --> 3850.839
earthers or do you mean the popularity

3847.839 --> 3852.0
of talking and debating flat earth

3850.839 --> 3854.5589999999997
online

3852.0 --> 3855.68
or how much of it will be accepted by

3854.559 --> 3859.119
the general public

3855.68 --> 3861.359
right yeah so what exactly

3859.119 --> 3862.6400000000003
the future of flat earth right these are

3861.359 --> 3867.2799999999997
all different

3862.64 --> 3869.839
parts that separately

3867.28 --> 3869.8390000000004
do things

3870.72 --> 3875.1189999999997
or change our influence rather

3876.079 --> 3883.039
i think we need to cycle why no

3879.52 --> 3886.559
dude just no i've already said

3883.039 --> 3887.6800000000003
plenty about granty and i don't really

3886.559 --> 3890.4
care to

3887.68 --> 3892.799
i'm not gonna be like oh i am i'm going

3890.4 --> 3896.319
to profile him and just say that every

3892.799 --> 3896.64
no i'm not going to do that i've already

3896.319 --> 3899.2
said

3896.64 --> 3901.52
plenty about him describes his character

3899.2 --> 3905.359
traits how he's doing

3901.52 --> 3905.359
how he does things what he likes

3906.839 --> 3909.839
no

3936.96 --> 3943.92
right clutch bear yeah i get that

3940.16 --> 3943.92
and i kind of feel the same

3945.839 --> 3950.5589999999997
it's just that he's had a history with

3948.559 --> 3951.92
the flat earth debate specifically and

3950.559 --> 3955.6800000000003
with me

3951.92 --> 3957.6800000000003
so people like to bring it up and

3955.68 --> 3959.44
yeah i don't really like talking about

3957.68 --> 3965.839
him

3959.44 --> 3965.839
i don't think he's interesting

3977.76 --> 3993.8390000000004
thanks man for what you have done what

3980.4 --> 3993.839
do you mean david blackson

3999.44 --> 4006.4
you have mail what

4002.799 --> 4009.839
send me an email

4006.4 --> 4013.76
oh you did blackpool

4009.839 --> 4013.7599999999998
oh cool thanks man

4015.28 --> 4018.88
yeah you sent me the picture that's

4016.88 --> 4035.839
awesome

4018.88 --> 4035.839
right i'll present that actually

4040.88 --> 4046.319
what the right anyway

4044.079 --> 4047.599
this is it this is the picture in

4046.319 --> 4050.24
question

4047.599 --> 4052.88
and ranty did not take this picture just

4050.24 --> 4052.8799999999997
to be clear

4061.599 --> 4065.2000000000003
thank you for sending me that rob h

4065.52 --> 4070.4
i almost forgot about it but yeah i

4067.359 --> 4077.839
couldn't find it on the

4070.4 --> 4077.839
in my preliminary search thanks

4082.16 --> 4086.0
yeah thanks sampson i appreciate that

4084.4 --> 4089.2000000000003
and i agree

4086.0 --> 4092.0
like just a bunch of people trolls

4089.2 --> 4094.48
just saying literally dying is just lame

4092.0 --> 4096.319
just get out

4094.48 --> 4097.839
i don't even really like it when people

4096.319 --> 4101.4400000000005
do that about the globe

4097.839 --> 4105.839
in my chat because it's like yeah

4101.44 --> 4105.839
kind of a waste of time

4108.0 --> 4112.64
dude you do a good job for flat earth

4110.48 --> 4115.599999999999
everyone knows rent is sticking

4112.64 --> 4119.359
it to the floor thank you dave blackson

4115.6 --> 4122.64
i appreciate that

4119.359 --> 4126.4800000000005
i i do my best i know i'm not the most

4122.64 --> 4131.1990000000005
glorious representative

4126.48 --> 4134.159
right i'm a bit of a weirdo

4131.199 --> 4134.159
in my own right

4135.04 --> 4138.88
but i'd like to think that i got the

4137.6 --> 4146.08
technicals

4138.88 --> 4149.4400000000005
down really well

4146.08 --> 4152.159
i've still like have yeah i really

4149.44 --> 4152.879999999999
i reached for the top that's what i

4152.159 --> 4156.799
could see

4152.88 --> 4159.759
and just reach like okay i'm gonna

4156.799 --> 4160.56
grab something that i'm ver it's very

4159.759 --> 4162.64
likely that

4160.56 --> 4164.2390000000005
the vast majority of people will just

4162.64 --> 4164.719
not even understand what i'm talking

4164.239 --> 4168.48
about

4164.719 --> 4172.0
and just keep doing that to really push

4168.48 --> 4175.199
the deeper insight and the the deeper

4172.0 --> 4177.44
unraveling of the

4175.199 --> 4179.759
the psychological mechanisms that are

4177.44 --> 4181.2789999999995
keeping the globe and globe thinking in

4179.759 --> 4184.799
place

4181.279 --> 4187.120000000001
to really push that and then

4184.799 --> 4188.719
i i tried to do that even very early on

4187.12 --> 4192.5599999999995
and then eventually

4188.719 --> 4195.12
nathan oakley at like kiwi on and

4192.56 --> 4197.120000000001
really this academic culture and the

4195.12 --> 4200.0
psychology came out more

4197.12 --> 4202.64
doing the same thing but from that angle

4200.0 --> 4206.4
and combining all of it

4202.64 --> 4209.1990000000005
yeah i'm pretty satisfied with

4206.4 --> 4209.92
the what you could say the discoveries

4209.199 --> 4214.0
that i've

4209.92 --> 4216.4800000000005
made things that i've pointed out

4214.0 --> 4220.0
that if if everything is all right help

4216.48 --> 4223.919999999999
the the general understanding of people

4220.0 --> 4226.0
when they try to think about the world

4223.92 --> 4226.96
and i'm proud of that one of the few

4226.0 --> 4232.08
things that i'm like

4226.96 --> 4232.08
actually really proud of like

4233.84 --> 4239.1990000000005
one could argue like that's the thing

4235.84 --> 4241.76
that's that might save me

4239.199 --> 4242.4
in the face of god because i think that

4241.76 --> 4245.280000000001
i just

4242.4 --> 4246.719
don't do very well on a whole lot of

4245.28 --> 4249.28
other things

4246.719 --> 4250.56
right i'm very dissatisfied about myself

4249.28 --> 4254.4
in ways

4250.56 --> 4254.400000000001
i just try to get by it's just

4256.239 --> 4260.4
don't always have a great opinion about

4258.0 --> 4260.4
myself

4260.88 --> 4266.2390000000005
and i'm very passive and that's a

4263.84 --> 4266.2390000000005
problem

4269.52 --> 4272.719
i just really like peace and quiet i

4272.239 --> 4287.839999999999
just

4272.719 --> 4287.84
really really like it

4290.239 --> 4295.678999999999
your moderators are great yeah they

4292.159 --> 4295.679
they're great they're fine

4295.84 --> 4300.159000000001
that's kind of cool because there are

4297.84 --> 4302.64
just a bunch of other trolls in here now

4300.159 --> 4302.639999999999
as well

4303.36 --> 4308.96
pat v do i think

4306.48 --> 4310.32
flat earth will be fully accepted by a

4308.96 --> 4312.56
mainstream

4310.32 --> 4314.239
as a mainstream fact as replacement of

4312.56 --> 4318.320000000001
the ball

4314.239 --> 4318.32
nope never

4320.88 --> 4329.84
no i don't think they can do it

4331.679 --> 4338.4800000000005
i think that even right it's

4336.239 --> 4339.28
it just doesn't work the same it doesn't

4338.48 --> 4341.599999999999
have the

4339.28 --> 4343.759999999999
effect i think because the ball also

4341.6 --> 4347.4400000000005
just binds

4343.76 --> 4349.84
people it's been part of media

4347.44 --> 4350.799999999999
of the radio started with the ball

4349.84 --> 4354.08
television

4350.8 --> 4357.28
ball it's

4354.08 --> 4361.92
it somehow binds

4357.28 --> 4364.8
a wider public in a way it's just

4361.92 --> 4365.28
they can't just replace that also what

4364.8 --> 4370.56
if

4365.28 --> 4371.84
the flat earth can't be used what if you

4370.56 --> 4374.88
can't actually show

4371.84 --> 4377.6
model of the flat earth right it just

4374.88 --> 4377.6
doesn't work

4378.32 --> 4385.12
for the intended effect of what it was

4382.56 --> 4386.400000000001
it's like the ball is like a binding

4385.12 --> 4389.199
spell to basically

4386.4 --> 4390.239
tie in the beliefs a whole bunch of

4389.199 --> 4392.879999999999
people

4390.239 --> 4395.199
it re it really is kind of that idea it

4392.88 --> 4395.1990000000005
yeah

4396.08 --> 4402.96
but it could be that it might be

4399.32 --> 4405.28
depopularized or kind of like cut out

4402.96 --> 4406.159
no more ball but they wouldn't then just

4405.28 --> 4408.32
say oh

4406.159 --> 4410.159
flat earth they would show the flat

4408.32 --> 4412.239
earth on the news or something right now

4410.159 --> 4414.719
i don't see that happening but they

4412.239 --> 4417.839999999999
might phase out the ball

4414.719 --> 4420.0
slightly or completely depending on

4417.84 --> 4421.1990000000005
like yeah i think if the ball is never

4420.0 --> 4426.239
gonna really go away

4421.199 --> 4428.08
through science fiction

4426.239 --> 4430.959999999999
that's like outlawed or something but

4428.08 --> 4430.96
that was crazy

4449.6 --> 4453.679
do you think someday everyone will

4451.6 --> 4456.320000000001
believe the baller story hot that's

4453.679 --> 4456.32
hilarious

4458.4 --> 4460.5599999999995
no

4465.6 --> 4470.320000000001
the only way that can be accomplished is

4468.08 --> 4473.199
if everybody gets

4470.32 --> 4474.799999999999
basically manipulated or coerced towards

4473.199 --> 4475.599999999999
the state of mind where they will

4474.8 --> 4478.88
literally

4475.6 --> 4480.88
believe anything you tell them

4478.88 --> 4497.6
and then they don't really believe they

4480.88 --> 4499.76
just support without understanding

4497.6 --> 4501.52
yeah samson i know it's it's kind of

4499.76 --> 4505.92
silly right

4501.52 --> 4505.92
it's just clinging on to things like oh

4506.159 --> 4510.639999999999
it is kind of a sign of desperation when

4508.48 --> 4514.639999999999
just a photograph can be

4510.64 --> 4517.92
put on such a pedestal as a proof

4514.64 --> 4525.84
when it's so easy to disprove

4517.92 --> 4525.84
to be proof of a ball

4543.92 --> 4547.28
do you ever see a refraction that goes

4546.48 --> 4553.839999999999
higher than

4547.28 --> 4553.84
flat what what does that mean iron 26

4564.32 --> 4567.679
has anyone debunked the blackpool photo

4566.56 --> 4570.8
yeah

4567.679 --> 4573.1990000000005
yeah watch the flat earth debates

4570.8 --> 4573.84
been talking about it for a week it's a

4573.199 --> 4576.719
it's a

4573.84 --> 4578.8
definite black swan like nathan even

4576.719 --> 4580.159
said this is a better black swan than

4578.8 --> 4584.400000000001
the original

4580.159 --> 4584.4
oil rig black swan photograph

4586.8 --> 4589.76
so yeah

4590.48 --> 4598.639999999999
all we had to do was find the original

4594.64 --> 4601.6
that conspiracy cats and ruhif

4598.64 --> 4602.719
and ranty had cropped into their

4601.6 --> 4604.96
supposed proof

4602.719 --> 4606.159
just find the original the confirmed

4604.96 --> 4608.56
original

4606.159 --> 4611.199
and that turns out to be a very dramatic

4608.56 --> 4611.1990000000005
black swan

4613.92 --> 4618.8
do i see any future for the fe as an

4616.88 --> 4620.88
established fact

4618.8 --> 4622.8
well it is an established stack that

4620.88 --> 4623.28
doesn't mean it's going to be admitted

4622.8 --> 4626.96
though

4623.28 --> 4626.96
right that's the point

4630.0 --> 4639.04
i don't think like government

4634.159 --> 4639.04
would ever really admit it like

4640.0 --> 4651.04
or mainstream media whatever you're

4642.96 --> 4654.8
gonna call it

4651.04 --> 4654.8
i think at best they would

4654.88 --> 4660.0
support the descent of the ball

4657.92 --> 4662.0
right they might go that right and just

4660.0 --> 4665.52
be like oh

4662.0 --> 4668.239
this is special

4665.52 --> 4670.320000000001
like flat earthers are interesting and

4668.239 --> 4672.639999999999
are artistic or something and

4670.32 --> 4674.5599999999995
look they yeah they doubt the ball and

4672.64 --> 4675.92
of course it's a ball but look they have

4674.56 --> 4679.360000000001
a very interesting art

4675.92 --> 4680.56
like that is probably the best you'll

4679.36 --> 4684.4
get out of it

4680.56 --> 4688.2390000000005
they will never just like declassify it

4684.4 --> 4691.5199999999995
they will never admit for real

4688.239 --> 4695.12
but they might entertain people

4691.52 --> 4695.120000000001
that go against the ball

4696.56 --> 4700.320000000001
right and we're already kind of seeing

4698.56 --> 4703.76
this whenever it's

4700.32 --> 4705.599999999999
sort of like brought to the attention

4703.76 --> 4707.6
unless they just straight out try to

4705.6 --> 4711.1990000000005
slam their flat earthers

4707.6 --> 4711.76
and purely ridicule them but when they

4711.199 --> 4716.4
don't

4711.76 --> 4716.400000000001
it's more like oh artistic this is

4718.84 --> 4721.84
interesting

4732.88 --> 4738.8
i believe science saves lives in

4735.92 --> 4738.8
hospitals

4738.96 --> 4742.8
signs i turn on my gps and my phone well

4742.159 --> 4744.639999999999
you don't

4742.8 --> 4749.679
obviously don't really understand

4744.64 --> 4754.96
exactly what science is

4749.679 --> 4754.96
but because from what

4759.36 --> 4765.199
gps is technology so it's your phone

4762.48 --> 4765.839999999999
and yeah science might save people's

4765.199 --> 4768.799999999999
lives

4765.84 --> 4769.360000000001
in hospitals but what's really going to

4768.8 --> 4772.8
do it

4769.36 --> 4776.799999999999
is just the skill experience and

4772.8 --> 4778.8
intuition of the medical personnel

4776.8 --> 4791.84
that they know the right thing to do in

4778.8 --> 4791.84
the right moment

4793.12 --> 4797.599999999999
that cannot be all purely attributed to

4796.159 --> 4800.639999999999
science really right

4797.6 --> 4802.64
science can prove things

4800.64 --> 4804.159000000001
that certain mechanics are real and all

4802.64 --> 4806.56
that but

4804.159 --> 4807.759999999999
through experimentation repeated and all

4806.56 --> 4811.84
that

4807.76 --> 4815.4400000000005
but science doesn't help a doctor

4811.84 --> 4818.8
to basically determine

4815.44 --> 4821.36
some complex thing that's

4818.8 --> 4822.2390000000005
like they still have to pick right it's

4821.36 --> 4825.759999999999
like oh you have

4822.239 --> 4826.718999999999
a thousand science options it could be

4825.76 --> 4828.159000000001
any of them

4826.719 --> 4829.92
right you think the doctor is going to

4828.159 --> 4831.839999999999
waste all their time just

4829.92 --> 4833.4400000000005
figuring it out based on all the science

4831.84 --> 4835.92
no they're going to

4833.44 --> 4839.36
try to zoom in and just personally

4835.92 --> 4839.36
figure out like what is this

4840.0 --> 4844.84
it's going to be more intuition-based

4842.4 --> 4861.839999999999
and cross-referencing

4844.84 --> 4861.84
experience and of course things taught

4872.84 --> 4875.84
okay

4886.84 --> 4890.8
so

4888.639 --> 4892.96
we always hear um it's a good one

4890.8 --> 4895.12
scrolling back a little iron 26

4892.96 --> 4897.199
we always hear the globe refraction as a

4895.12 --> 4900.5599999999995
reason it looks flat

4897.199 --> 4904.879999999999
that was the case we would see refracted

4900.56 --> 4909.1990000000005
higher more than flat concave

4904.88 --> 4909.1990000000005
well that

4910.0 --> 4915.92
no because their refraction

4913.12 --> 4916.719
is very specific it's like an inward

4915.92 --> 4919.36
spiral it

4916.719 --> 4921.52
it's not just the aggravation making it

4919.36 --> 4924.5599999999995
possible

4921.52 --> 4926.4800000000005
now it's but like

4924.56 --> 4928.400000000001
their globe refraction terrestrial

4926.48 --> 4932.08
fraction is paradoxical

4928.4 --> 4932.08
it cannot even be emulated

4933.679 --> 4938.2390000000005
can only be created as an afterward

4937.44 --> 4940.4
excuse

4938.239 --> 4943.44
when you take the flat observation then

4940.4 --> 4945.759999999999
figure out how must it be on the ball

4943.44 --> 4948.0
then what's the deviation and then back

4945.76 --> 4951.12
engineer

4948.0 --> 4952.88
what would sort of make it look flat

4951.12 --> 4954.159
when it was a ball that's terrestrial

4952.88 --> 4958.56
refraction but they can't

4954.159 --> 4961.759999999999
actually apply it they can't just take

4958.56 --> 4964.159000000001
ball emulations and actually

4961.76 --> 4965.04
within the ray tracing process make it

4964.159 --> 4967.759999999999
look flat

4965.04 --> 4968.4
nobody's ever done that it never really

4967.76 --> 4972.320000000001
works

4968.4 --> 4976.32
it always becomes a mess so it's

4972.32 --> 4976.32
it's purely science fiction terrestrial

4984.84 --> 4987.84
refraction

4989.92 --> 4994.4800000000005
but what it does it doesn't it wouldn't

4992.239 --> 4998.48
like concavize

4994.48 --> 4998.48
things because

4999.76 --> 5003.1990000000005
it's supposed to be on a ball

5003.76 --> 5008.719
terrestrial refraction has never been

5006.159 --> 5010.799999999999
seen to be so dramatic

5008.719 --> 5011.92
that it would result in a concave

5010.8 --> 5014.639
observation it

5011.92 --> 5016.4800000000005
it's not even in the science fiction

5014.639 --> 5018.32
concept of it it's not supposed to work

5016.48 --> 5022.0
like that

5018.32 --> 5023.84
it's only like the a singular

5022.0 --> 5026.96
directional

5023.84 --> 5028.400000000001
angle or bending it's only in that

5026.96 --> 5030.719
direction

5028.4 --> 5033.679
right visually it's only with the curve

5030.719 --> 5035.6
it's never the other way around

5033.679 --> 5039.52
at best it can just be made to look

5035.6 --> 5039.52
perfectly flat it can't be made to look

5040.84 --> 5043.84
concave

5050.32 --> 5057.84
it's a b let me get that b

5054.84 --> 5057.84
out

5068.84 --> 5071.84
um

5083.199 --> 5113.839999999999
it's making a lot of noise

5099.84 --> 5113.84
got him

5115.28 --> 5119.599999999999
ah don't pilots fly by keeping the line

5117.84 --> 5121.6
on the horizon bar

5119.6 --> 5123.280000000001
well yeah they use a gyroscope and they

5121.6 --> 5125.52
just make sure that the gyroscope

5123.28 --> 5127.12
doesn't tilt

5125.52 --> 5128.320000000001
because that mean that the plane would

5127.12 --> 5131.12
actually be tilting because the

5128.32 --> 5135.679
gyroscope is perfectly

5131.12 --> 5135.679
rigid in its orientation

5137.52 --> 5141.84
so yes

5149.52 --> 5155.84
oh what's that

5167.679 --> 5173.92
oh right yeah yeah

5171.04 --> 5173.92
i remember that

5180.48 --> 5184.718999999999
somebody made a new video but it's

5182.239 --> 5184.718999999999
pretty cool

5185.36 --> 5188.799999999999
that's a good one i'll actually post

5186.88 --> 5197.84
that in the skype

5188.8 --> 5197.84
chat too for reference

5203.199 --> 5206.638999999999
but i remember that yes there's plenty

5205.28 --> 5208.96
of documents out there

5206.639 --> 5210.0
also we treated that on the flat earth

5208.96 --> 5212.96
debate it all came

5210.0 --> 5214.88
by that indeed in many official

5212.96 --> 5217.44
documents

5214.88 --> 5218.4800000000005
from nasa from the government they it

5217.44 --> 5221.839999999999
just proves

5218.48 --> 5227.5199999999995
the technicals of it that they all

5221.84 --> 5227.52
use yeah flat a flat earth

5228.96 --> 5231.84
in their modeling

5234.159 --> 5237.759999999999
now thank you for sharing samson it's a

5236.32 --> 5240.0
good video i think

5237.76 --> 5243.679
or at least it's it's probably a good

5240.0 --> 5243.679
video i haven't actually watched this

5250.84 --> 5253.84
one

5256.32 --> 5261.04
visual frame of reference is what pilots

5258.719 --> 5261.04
call

5261.6 --> 5267.84
using the level okay

5274.08 --> 5282.159
it's all about true vertical

5278.08 --> 5282.159
and horizontal follows

5282.56 --> 5285.679
uh what

5286.56 --> 5288.88
no

5290.719 --> 5296.4
well you could do that

5294.8 --> 5298.719
but you could also do it the other way

5296.4 --> 5298.719
around

5298.8 --> 5305.6
find the average horizontal and then

5301.92 --> 5305.6
you can establish a vertical

5306.32 --> 5309.92
or you establish the vertical and then

5308.719 --> 5322.639
orientate

5309.92 --> 5325.6
the horizontal around it like yeah but

5322.639 --> 5329.36
use basically using a

5325.6 --> 5337.84
a pendulum or a plumb bob

5329.36 --> 5337.839999999999
that's what they call it i think

5364.239 --> 5369.678999999999
oh god the ballers are always the same

5369.92 --> 5376.4800000000005
they always just try to sneak

5373.36 --> 5376.96
in the use of a word in the mechanics

5376.48 --> 5379.599999999999
and then

5376.96 --> 5380.4800000000005
use that as evidence because the lingo

5379.6 --> 5383.84
of the

5380.48 --> 5387.199
baller mechanics are used

5383.84 --> 5389.12
that means it must be real i've seen so

5387.199 --> 5392.159
many ballers make these arguments

5389.12 --> 5407.84
in chats

5392.159 --> 5407.839999999999
even rumpus likes to do that sometimes

5409.679 --> 5423.76
ignores the reduction in gravity

5421.76 --> 5425.84
yeah well there is no gravity doesn't

5423.76 --> 5427.280000000001
actually exist it's a concept you can

5425.84 --> 5429.52
calculate it

5427.28 --> 5430.96
can be very convenient as long as you

5429.52 --> 5434.159000000001
don't really account for

5430.96 --> 5436.08
gases right that's why in architecture

5434.159 --> 5439.12
there is

5436.08 --> 5440.719
they use gravity very easy to balance

5439.12 --> 5444.0
out the the weight

5440.719 --> 5445.6
of the building that can with the

5444.0 --> 5447.199
yeah that it has enough structural

5445.6 --> 5449.04
integrity to basically

5447.199 --> 5451.599999999999
stay the way it is and not create

5449.04 --> 5453.679
unforeseen forces

5451.6 --> 5455.04
and then there's the pressure dynamics

5453.679 --> 5457.36
which they add on

5455.04 --> 5458.08
separately because gravity doesn't

5457.36 --> 5463.839999999999
actually

5458.08 --> 5463.84
take just gas dynamics into account

5465.76 --> 5469.84
that's why they also invented buoyancy

5467.76 --> 5471.6
to just give the other side because

5469.84 --> 5473.76
gravity actually doesn't really deal

5471.6 --> 5476.56
with it

5473.76 --> 5478.56
mechanically right but because of this

5476.56 --> 5480.120000000001
you can just unify all of it

5478.56 --> 5482.8
in something that's actually

5480.12 --> 5484.96
demonstratable through scientific method

5482.8 --> 5488.159000000001
and that's relative density

5484.96 --> 5492.639
it accounts for all material

5488.159 --> 5492.638999999999
what it does based on its density

5495.76 --> 5505.84
and the density that surrounds it

5509.92 --> 5514.4800000000005
reduction in gravity on there well

5512.32 --> 5517.679
seeking star wars yeah yeah that's

5514.48 --> 5521.199
part of the trick saying that but

5517.679 --> 5525.12
look technically if you just realize

5521.199 --> 5528.96
that gravity is actually like a

5525.12 --> 5531.28
machination it's really relative density

5528.96 --> 5533.32
then you can figure out that there's

5531.28 --> 5537.44
actually

5533.32 --> 5540.48
alterations of forces

5537.44 --> 5542.32
based on the height purely due to the

5540.48 --> 5546.0
surrounding medium right

5542.32 --> 5549.759999999999
so relatively high dense

5546.0 --> 5552.96
objects will probably fall faster

5549.76 --> 5554.96
at first when they're really high up

5552.96 --> 5556.08
because everything over there is much

5554.96 --> 5559.84
less dense

5556.08 --> 5561.04
so the offset of the density of the

5559.84 --> 5565.52
object is going to be

5561.04 --> 5567.76
more so it will accelerate even harder

5565.52 --> 5570.0
through it to reach its equilibrium

5567.76 --> 5571.84
which is going to be down there

5570.0 --> 5573.52
right and then as it approaches the

5571.84 --> 5575.92
lower regions

5573.52 --> 5577.92
air friction sets in slows it down

5575.92 --> 5581.1990000000005
probably

5577.92 --> 5583.6
and it is also surrounded by a denser

5581.199 --> 5585.919999999999
medium at that point

5583.6 --> 5587.4400000000005
so yeah there is sort of a change but

5585.92 --> 5589.6
actually

5587.44 --> 5591.36
if you just realize relative density is

5589.6 --> 5592.88
actually that gravity is actually

5591.36 --> 5593.599999999999
relative density then you could even

5592.88 --> 5596.96
argue

5593.6 --> 5600.2390000000005
gravity is higher

5596.96 --> 5603.36
the further you go up but this is that's

5600.239 --> 5605.36
but not literally though

5603.36 --> 5606.719
because gravity isn't literal but

5605.36 --> 5609.12
technically the

5606.719 --> 5609.76
what is associated with gravity is

5609.12 --> 5612.48
actually

5609.76 --> 5614.2390000000005
higher the higher up you go because

5612.48 --> 5615.28
you're always going to be surrounded by

5614.239 --> 5618.799999999999
a medium that's

5615.28 --> 5618.8
less dense as down there

5623.84 --> 5627.1990000000005
unless of course yeah you have

5625.679 --> 5629.52
sufficient

5627.199 --> 5632.32
helium balloon or whatever to offset

5629.52 --> 5632.320000000001
that density

5632.639 --> 5638.400000000001
but i bet that if you are really high up

5636.159 --> 5639.44
that you will literally in your body

5638.4 --> 5642.239
experience

5639.44 --> 5642.719
more pull downward you will probably

5642.239 --> 5646.799999999999
feel

5642.719 --> 5651.52
more pull on you downward because

5646.8 --> 5651.52
all the air around you is thinner

5652.239 --> 5656.799999999999
has anybody ever like probably also with

5654.96 --> 5660.639
mountain climbing and when you go up

5656.8 --> 5662.639
really high you'll probably feel heavier

5660.639 --> 5665.52
not lighter heavier because you're

5662.639 --> 5668.56
surrounded by air that's less dense

5665.52 --> 5671.360000000001
so the offset that this equilibrium will

5668.56 --> 5673.6
be even higher

5671.36 --> 5676.5599999999995
right just as why you experience sort of

5673.6 --> 5680.2390000000005
weightlessness when you float in water

5676.56 --> 5680.8
because there this equilibrium is not as

5680.239 --> 5684.839999999999
high

5680.8 --> 5691.4400000000005
so you feel more neutral you feel floaty

5684.84 --> 5691.4400000000005
right another refracted suicide what

5695.04 --> 5700.08
globe earth sniper yeah it's a good one

5697.52 --> 5704.639
oh god and yesterday also with

5700.08 --> 5704.639
the corki pope god

5705.52 --> 5711.76
it was only a matter of time though

5708.719 --> 5712.32
before that was gonna happen like as

5711.76 --> 5715.360000000001
soon as

5712.32 --> 5718.799999999999
you got like

5715.36 --> 5722.639
down syndrome president like you knew

5718.8 --> 5722.639
there was at some point gonna be a pope

5723.6 --> 5730.2390000000005
of that i just felt that

5726.96 --> 5733.36
but it's so funny yeah it's good stuff

5730.239 --> 5737.28
a flatter sniper

5733.36 --> 5739.5199999999995
i really do like how owen benjamin

5737.28 --> 5741.5199999999995
actively keeps talking about flat earth

5739.52 --> 5744.400000000001
periodically

5741.52 --> 5746.4800000000005
like that i really appreciated that he

5744.4 --> 5747.36
didn't just do it to kind of like grab

5746.48 --> 5750.48
the attention

5747.36 --> 5757.839999999999
and then no longer talks about it like

5750.48 --> 5757.839999999999
he actually really does that's cool man

5782.239 --> 5786.919999999999
to remove the gravity loss at higher

5785.199 --> 5791.199
altitudes

5786.92 --> 5796.08
centripetal factor must be eliminated

5791.199 --> 5800.0
what this is all purely conceptual

5796.08 --> 5803.679
path five pet v come on

5800.0 --> 5805.6
this there is no gravity loss over

5803.679 --> 5808.08
height and there is no centripetal

5805.6 --> 5808.08
factor

5808.159 --> 5813.44
that makes no sense especially in

5810.8 --> 5816.96
another space

5813.44 --> 5816.96
this is all conceptual

5817.76 --> 5822.0
like the relative density this

5819.92 --> 5825.36
equilibrium forces

5822.0 --> 5828.719
are pretty uniform pretty consistent

5825.36 --> 5830.48
there is no variation within space of it

5828.719 --> 5832.4
you know it's just what's the

5830.48 --> 5833.5199999999995
differential between the object and the

5832.4 --> 5837.36
medium

5833.52 --> 5839.52
it doesn't matter where it is

5837.36 --> 5841.44
doesn't matter it's just the

5839.52 --> 5844.56
differential between the object

5841.44 --> 5847.36
and the medium what is it that's this

5844.56 --> 5848.56
and that force that force formula

5847.36 --> 5851.36
that'll roll out of that

5848.56 --> 5854.080000000001
is consistent it is it is always

5851.36 --> 5855.44
consistent there is no alteration in

5854.08 --> 5858.159
whatever you presume

5855.44 --> 5860.4
actually causes this effect of relative

5858.159 --> 5860.719
density which some people like to argue

5860.4 --> 5863.36
is

5860.719 --> 5865.199
actually gravity that causes it for some

5863.36 --> 5869.679
bizarre reason

5865.199 --> 5872.159
right there is no alteration in it

5869.679 --> 5873.36
forces alter when the differential

5872.159 --> 5876.0
between the object

5873.36 --> 5876.799999999999
and the medium changes when it becomes

5876.0 --> 5879.84
different

5876.8 --> 5883.119000000001
when it's a higher in between

5879.84 --> 5885.52
it it's more off then the force will

5883.119 --> 5888.799999999999
become bigger as it becomes

5885.52 --> 5892.0
closer than less force and if it's

5888.8 --> 5892.719
almost equal yeah it might just slowly

5892.0 --> 5894.56
drift

5892.719 --> 5896.56
that's how it works and it doesn't

5894.56 --> 5898.56
matter where it is the only thing that

5896.56 --> 5900.96
matters is the differential between the

5898.56 --> 5904.320000000001
object and the medium

5900.96 --> 5911.84
it's the only thing that actually causes

5904.32 --> 5911.84
the displacement

5915.6 --> 5919.1990000000005
yeah slow mo moon buggy i know

5919.52 --> 5923.76
if you go to my page i haven't in my

5922.639 --> 5927.84
favorites

5923.76 --> 5929.6
gary terry tea time with gary and terry

5927.84 --> 5931.4400000000005
also has some kind of other backup

5929.6 --> 5935.360000000001
channel

5931.44 --> 5937.919999999999
which uploads clips also worth checking

5935.36 --> 5940.159
out also put in my favorite list

5937.92 --> 5943.1990000000005
healthier alone

5940.159 --> 5946.0
is really choosing these names

5943.199 --> 5946.0
it's hilarious

5951.04 --> 5967.84
so check out that also

5984.32 --> 5987.679
how do you measure things in the sky

5986.159 --> 5988.879999999999
well what are you gonna measure about

5987.679 --> 5994.29
them

5988.88 --> 5997.56
super straight arthur

5994.29 --> 5997.56
[Music]

6002.52 --> 6008.530000000001
[Music]

6027.04 --> 6031.119
plum bob's proof flat earth

6032.96 --> 6051.84
well they definitely help

6036.0 --> 6051.84
to establish it yeah

6069.76 --> 6073.6
right james mason need the right tool

6072.159 --> 6075.759999999999
for the right job

6073.6 --> 6077.04
well the thing is though the ballers do

6075.76 --> 6080.719
use the right tools

6077.04 --> 6084.88
they just do a little extra on top of it

6080.719 --> 6087.36
this ferrous sphericize

6084.88 --> 6088.719
the the normal things right it's what

6087.36 --> 6090.5599999999995
they always do it's like

6088.719 --> 6095.04
they do the normal things and then they

6090.56 --> 6095.04
add the baller machination on top of it

6095.36 --> 6098.4
and then say that's how you're supposed

6096.88 --> 6100.32
to do it

6098.4 --> 6107.839999999999
and that's how they do all these things

6100.32 --> 6107.84
everything out there

6118.84 --> 6121.84
uh

6128.08 --> 6135.84
their monkey senses weapons

6146.84 --> 6149.84
uh

6151.44 --> 6154.48
is that black swan background noise no

6153.92 --> 6163.84
that's

6154.48 --> 6163.839999999999
that's a rooster

6178.56 --> 6182.56
well i've never really seen the animal a

6181.36 --> 6185.36
black swan

6182.56 --> 6185.76
out here before there's white swans

6185.36 --> 6190.719
though

6185.76 --> 6195.360000000001
there's a lot more gooses and ducks and

6190.719 --> 6195.36
other types of water birds but yeah

6197.36 --> 6201.199
actual black swans i've never seen them

6199.44 --> 6204.0
here in this region

6201.199 --> 6204.719
in netherlands and in general maybe like

6204.0 --> 6208.56
at a

6204.719 --> 6212.56
petting zoo or something or probably not

6208.56 --> 6212.56
they don't really have them it's always

6216.84 --> 6219.84
gooses

6225.28 --> 6233.84
hmm is that so they were originally in

6229.679 --> 6233.84
australia okay could be

6236.88 --> 6240.08
is the earth contained

6244.08 --> 6248.639
there has to be a containment a finite

6247.28 --> 6250.96
volume

6248.639 --> 6254.08
that con that is contained how it is

6250.96 --> 6254.08
contained i don't know

6259.6 --> 6275.84
all right be back in two minutes

6328.84 --> 6331.84
um

6356.84 --> 6362.08
uh-huh

6358.4 --> 6365.199
no tiny well he's a

6362.08 --> 6368.08
house decorator so he did work on houses

6365.199 --> 6370.638999999999
but i don't know if he still does that

6368.08 --> 6373.84
tiny wumble

6370.639 --> 6373.84
that's what i remember

6381.84 --> 6387.84
do the oceans have a bottom i certainly

6384.4 --> 6387.839999999999
hope so

6389.84 --> 6392.2390000000005
all right

6394.0 --> 6400.32
by the way i had just happened had a

6397.28 --> 6402.719
small thought about that yesterday

6400.32 --> 6404.799999999999
i'm thinking like how do we truly figure

6402.719 --> 6406.4800000000005
out

6404.8 --> 6408.2390000000005
how the earth's surface is

6406.48 --> 6411.36
interconnected for real

6408.239 --> 6413.36
like how do we truly establish this

6411.36 --> 6415.839999999999
and the only way that i could think of

6413.36 --> 6415.839999999999
is

6416.08 --> 6423.84
by truly grid measuring

6420.8 --> 6426.88
everything especially the oceanic bottom

6423.84 --> 6429.76
like the land masses is one thing right

6426.88 --> 6432.400000000001
but if you map out the oceanic bottom in

6429.76 --> 6435.679
a perfect grid system

6432.4 --> 6438.799999999999
perfect euclidean grid system

6435.679 --> 6442.56
then you don't even need you just have

6438.8 --> 6443.76
everything but the land if you could

6442.56 --> 6448.719
grid it out

6443.76 --> 6448.719
i don't know with buoys temporarily

6450.8 --> 6454.639
then you could yeah establish like what

6453.679 --> 6458.159
is this

6454.639 --> 6459.52
how is this truly connected euclidean

6458.159 --> 6461.44
wise

6459.52 --> 6464.320000000001
how does this truly connect and it could

6461.44 --> 6466.96
reveal really weird things

6464.32 --> 6468.08
i've even imagined like what if it is

6466.96 --> 6470.639
like a weird

6468.08 --> 6472.4
looping situation in a way but it's like

6470.639 --> 6474.88
irregular looping

6472.4 --> 6477.04
that it doesn't actually just perfectly

6474.88 --> 6479.119
cookie cutter connects

6477.04 --> 6480.239
gets weird what would happen well what

6479.119 --> 6483.679
would happen is

6480.239 --> 6486.718999999999
you you let these i guess submarines

6483.679 --> 6487.52
go out create the grid over the bottom

6486.719 --> 6489.92
you get this

6487.52 --> 6491.1990000000005
square system and then at some point

6489.92 --> 6494.88
they meet

6491.199 --> 6497.28
and the grid just dislocates

6494.88 --> 6498.0
like okay this was perfectly straight

6497.28 --> 6500.4
line

6498.0 --> 6503.52
on the other side it enters like that

6500.4 --> 6506.719
and then you get like whoa

6503.52 --> 6510.4800000000005
the grid does not fit

6506.719 --> 6513.52
even though it's all there right

6510.48 --> 6516.239
but that way you with a grid

6513.52 --> 6517.4400000000005
with a grid system of the oceanic bottom

6516.239 --> 6521.678999999999
you could

6517.44 --> 6526.4
potentially truly try to figure out

6521.679 --> 6527.4400000000005
what the realm really is like how it

6526.4 --> 6530.879999999999
actually interconnects

6527.44 --> 6533.4
if there is special looping going on

6530.88 --> 6536.32
and if there are strange spatial

6533.4 --> 6539.759999999999
irregularities happening

6536.32 --> 6540.32
like the grid measuring of the oceanic

6539.76 --> 6543.04
bottom

6540.32 --> 6544.0
would absolutely reveal all of that it

6543.04 --> 6547.36
would have to

6544.0 --> 6550.96
if it was all done honestly

6547.36 --> 6553.92
right so

6550.96 --> 6555.52
in that sense it would almost be kind of

6553.92 --> 6558.719
like the

6555.52 --> 6559.679
google street view right going after the

6558.719 --> 6561.52
street

6559.679 --> 6563.4400000000005
and measure like literally taking

6561.52 --> 6566.400000000001
footage

6563.44 --> 6568.159
well it would be sort of like that but

6566.4 --> 6570.32
with the ocean bottom

6568.159 --> 6571.28
gridding it out going everywhere going

6570.32 --> 6576.08
in like

6571.28 --> 6580.719
perfect straight lines and then every

6576.08 --> 6584.719
thus far take a scan

6580.719 --> 6587.199
and like maybe drop a buoy

6584.719 --> 6589.28
maybe not maybe just determine a grid

6587.199 --> 6594.96
point within the taken image

6589.28 --> 6594.96
within the scan and then grid it out

6595.119 --> 6601.199
and that way yeah however it is all

6597.679 --> 6604.32
orientated it would reveal itself

6601.199 --> 6607.678999999999
you would get just a big

6604.32 --> 6608.799999999999
set of puzzle pieces grids that you can

6607.679 --> 6611.52
then put together

6608.8 --> 6612.4800000000005
and then end up however you could

6611.52 --> 6615.76
literally just

6612.48 --> 6616.5599999999995
have it established like how does this

6615.76 --> 6619.360000000001
interconnect

6616.56 --> 6620.400000000001
and does it actually fit does every

6619.36 --> 6623.759999999999
square fit

6620.4 --> 6627.44
another square or is it going to end up

6623.76 --> 6630.159000000001
just weirdly connecting

6627.44 --> 6630.159
on sides

6631.04 --> 6634.56
doing well on the doubtful yeah i don't

6632.88 --> 6639.04
know what it is tiny womble

6634.56 --> 6642.26
just they're squirting

6639.04 --> 6642.26
[Music]

6651.36 --> 6654.639
right but if you want to counteract that

6654.0 --> 6658.159
guys

6654.639 --> 6662.0
gals then yeah rogens it up

6658.159 --> 6663.839999999999
right doesn't matter if they if they

6662.0 --> 6664.719
want to play a game again and see oh

6663.84 --> 6667.4400000000005
let's get him

6664.719 --> 6668.32
on minus hundred or minus a thousand

6667.44 --> 6672.239
just to

6668.32 --> 6674.88
show how i'm they trust just

6672.239 --> 6676.638999999999
a mass attempt a gaslighting thing to

6674.88 --> 6678.639
make me feel shitty about myself

6676.639 --> 6680.8
well good luck with that right just

6678.639 --> 6683.84
because i on average don't really have

6680.8 --> 6685.119000000001
a great feelings toward myself doesn't

6683.84 --> 6687.84
mean

6685.119 --> 6689.679
that that i'm gonna allow you to do the

6687.84 --> 6693.92
same thing and be fooled by that

6689.679 --> 6694.719
yeah that that's part of the point of it

6693.92 --> 6696.719
right

6694.719 --> 6698.639
part of why i developed those feelings

6696.719 --> 6702.08
towards myself is because i

6698.639 --> 6706.96
was very easily full in the past

6702.08 --> 6709.199
and gonna be fooled again right

6706.96 --> 6710.2390000000005
good luck with that so it doesn't really

6709.199 --> 6713.919999999999
help

6710.239 --> 6715.759999999999
and if i just get support that does help

6713.92 --> 6719.119
right and there's nothing trolls can do

6715.76 --> 6722.4800000000005
about it so if you help me

6719.119 --> 6724.4
through verbal support

6722.48 --> 6726.0
through learning through actually just

6724.4 --> 6729.04
participating

6726.0 --> 6731.92
learning sharing information

6729.04 --> 6734.159
trying to do the right thing trying to

6731.92 --> 6735.1990000000005
be pure uphold the right spirit do the

6734.159 --> 6738.239
right thing

6735.199 --> 6741.598999999999
and hopefully also support me through

6738.239 --> 6743.759999999999
paypal especially then yeah

6741.599 --> 6747.119000000001
it's nothing all the downvotes in the

6743.76 --> 6751.84
world are not gonna matter anything

6747.119 --> 6751.839999999999
it really doesn't matter

6754.88 --> 6758.96
all right and i'm gonna round out the

6756.719 --> 6765.84
show anyway

6758.96 --> 6765.84
wow all the sucks are coming out

6768.56 --> 6772.719
down votes actually still whatever man

6774.639 --> 6779.84
that's that's all fine dude

6782.88 --> 6785.37
a lot of people that get that treatment

6785.119 --> 6786.719
they

6785.37 --> 6789.04
[Music]

6786.719 --> 6791.44
they turn off the visuals for it they

6789.04 --> 6793.76
say oh you can't see anymore if it's up

6791.44 --> 6796.32
or down

6793.76 --> 6798.400000000001
and turn it off i don't because i'd like

6796.32 --> 6801.119
to show

6798.4 --> 6801.679
how messed up people really are out

6801.119 --> 6805.44
there

6801.679 --> 6809.679
like i like to show the ugly

6805.44 --> 6813.199
of the world to the world also

6809.679 --> 6815.4400000000005
because i suffer under it indirectly

6813.199 --> 6817.04
not because of what they do it's just

6815.44 --> 6820.08
that these people are

6817.04 --> 6822.239
out there and there seems very

6820.08 --> 6825.199
little we can do about it except just

6822.239 --> 6825.199
grow out of it

6825.92 --> 6831.679
and i'd like to basically show that too

6829.44 --> 6835.839999999999
i like to be raw even with the world

6831.679 --> 6835.84
that surrounds me

6837.52 --> 6840.8
right i like to keep it real i like to

6839.679 --> 6844.159
deal with

6840.8 --> 6847.4400000000005
reality as if it were reality and not

6844.159 --> 6851.5199999999995
some soap opera shitty thing

6847.44 --> 6855.119
that people can latch onto

6851.52 --> 6855.119000000001
i like to keep it real

6855.599 --> 6859.360000000001
and i also do this for myself

6860.08 --> 6863.84
because i need to keep it real

6865.199 --> 6869.678999999999
get away from the flatter then you'll be

6867.119 --> 6873.199
happier no

6869.679 --> 6876.8
no no i won't i'd be

6873.199 --> 6879.919999999999
absolutely isolated and just

6876.8 --> 6881.76
not able to talk about good ideas with

6879.92 --> 6883.119
people because they wouldn't listen to

6881.76 --> 6885.52
me

6883.119 --> 6887.679
like flat earth's not gonna go away like

6885.52 --> 6890.4800000000005
i've i'm already cosmogenist

6887.679 --> 6891.36
i've already got these ideas in my head

6890.48 --> 6894.5599999999995
so much

6891.36 --> 6896.0
that i even refuse i seem to refuse to

6894.56 --> 6898.4800000000005
even write a book about it

6896.0 --> 6899.28
even though people have asked me to do

6898.48 --> 6903.119
that i just

6899.28 --> 6906.239
no no it's here it's gonna stay there

6903.119 --> 6906.239
it's not gonna go away

6911.28 --> 6916.0
right flatter's not gonna go away i i

6913.36 --> 6919.28
tried i tried several times

6916.0 --> 6921.76
i got woken up then

6919.28 --> 6924.8
fell back to sleep woken up again fell

6921.76 --> 6928.0
back to sleep every time due to

6924.8 --> 6929.4400000000005
i couldn't handle it i was too shocked

6928.0 --> 6933.44
about it

6929.44 --> 6934.48
i did not like lost confidence in the

6933.44 --> 6936.5599999999995
world become

6934.48 --> 6939.199
completely demoralized and then forget

6936.56 --> 6941.84
about it start over again yeah

6939.199 --> 6943.28
well i've been confronted so many times

6941.84 --> 6947.52
at some point

6943.28 --> 6950.08
you just

6947.52 --> 6952.8
you just don't let it go to sleep and

6950.08 --> 6956.4
you can't let it go to sleep anymore

6952.8 --> 6957.76
okay i can't get it out i'm i'm a flat

6956.4 --> 6960.08
earther

6957.76 --> 6962.56
i'm always going to be a flat earther

6960.08 --> 6966.4
forever

6962.56 --> 6969.119000000001
right does it mean that i cannot enjoy

6966.4 --> 6971.679
some of the entertainment and especially

6969.119 --> 6973.839999999999
the mechanical entertainment and the

6971.679 --> 6975.599
fantasy that comes with the ball

6973.84 --> 6978.0
cosmology and everything that comes with

6975.599 --> 6981.04
it yeah that can be very entertaining

6978.0 --> 6984.88
and i can definitely have

6981.04 --> 6984.88
that and deal with that

6985.04 --> 6990.08
but i'm always i'm going to see it from

6988.159 --> 6993.04
a flat earth perspective i'm never going

6990.08 --> 6995.5199999999995
to be fooled again that flat earth

6993.04 --> 6996.48
is bad and wrong and that the ball is

6995.52 --> 7000.96
real

6996.48 --> 7003.919999999999
never ever again into all eternity

7000.96 --> 7004.32
ever again never it's never going to

7003.92 --> 7007.599
happen

7004.32 --> 7008.4
ever again no matter what even if it

7007.599 --> 7013.119000000001
kills me

7008.4 --> 7016.159
i don't care literally i will die

7013.119 --> 7018.88
i would die before

7016.159 --> 7019.28
that happens and i can't even say before

7018.88 --> 7021.1990000000005
that

7019.28 --> 7022.5599999999995
because even beyond death it's never

7021.199 --> 7026.0
gonna happen i will

7022.56 --> 7028.0
never switch again ever

7026.0 --> 7029.84
it's never gonna ever happen again under

7028.0 --> 7031.36
any circumstances no matter how

7029.84 --> 7034.4800000000005
torturous

7031.36 --> 7036.799999999999
it's never gonna happen so yeah keep

7034.48 --> 7038.879999999999
just keep squirting for me keep virtue

7036.8 --> 7042.159000000001
signaling your ball it's not gonna help

7038.88 --> 7042.96
anything it's only gonna help contribute

7042.159 --> 7046.159
to

7042.96 --> 7048.639
showing the world as it is how people

7046.159 --> 7049.36
really are what they actually do with

7048.639 --> 7051.52
their lives

7049.36 --> 7052.48
including myself but also some of these

7051.52 --> 7057.119000000001
trolls in chat

7052.48 --> 7061.759999999999
just that's people

7057.119 --> 7073.839999999999
right that's actually people doing that

7061.76 --> 7073.84
that's their lives now

7079.44 --> 7090.32
all right tiny wumbo i appreciate that

7087.199 --> 7092.5599999999995
yes and indeed you're you've definitely

7090.32 --> 7094.639
got a lid on the at homes and i

7092.56 --> 7095.76
truly appreciate you for that even

7094.639 --> 7098.4800000000005
though you can be

7095.76 --> 7099.52
a bit of a baller but yeah that's what

7098.48 --> 7102.638999999999
happens

7099.52 --> 7102.639
when you believe in the ball

7105.76 --> 7112.400000000001
right no samson you didn't

7110.56 --> 7114.320000000001
i would absolutely object if i saw

7112.4 --> 7116.799999999999
somebody time

7114.32 --> 7118.32
time knee womble out i know like what's

7116.8 --> 7120.719
this

7118.32 --> 7122.48
but anyway i will round out the show now

7120.719 --> 7124.8
so thanks everyone for coming

7122.48 --> 7126.4
i hope you liked the show i thought it

7124.8 --> 7129.119000000001
was decent enough

7126.4 --> 7130.719
it definitely ended more energetic than

7129.119 --> 7133.759999999999
it started

7130.719 --> 7135.84
got a bit of a jaw egg by the way but

7133.76 --> 7137.04
it's not really bad it's literally

7135.84 --> 7139.1990000000005
psychosomatic again

7137.04 --> 7140.56
it's this time on the right this

7139.199 --> 7143.199
whatever it's not

7140.56 --> 7145.599
terrible not as bad that it keep me

7143.199 --> 7145.598999999999
awake

7146.639 --> 7153.52
it'll probably be over again in the

7150.0 --> 7154.48
in a day or two anyway if you like this
