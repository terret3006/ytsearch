38.629 --> 46.82899999999999
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.809 --> 48.449
early-bird number 263 I'm your host

46.829 --> 50.339
Arwen and before we start the show

48.449 --> 52.86
please don't forget to share it on any

50.339 --> 54.21
platform you deem fit and also if you

52.86 --> 56.01
haven't already subscribed to my channel

54.21 --> 57.899
and hit the bell notification so you

56.01 --> 59.519
know when I'm going live which is

57.899 --> 62.28
normally 2 p.m.

59.519 --> 64.08
Amsterdam time every day please also

62.28 --> 67.05
don't forget to support my show through

64.08 --> 69.41
the Super chats PayPal my patreon and my

67.05 --> 73.49
GoFundMe much obliged

69.41 --> 78.06
so yeah corrected that volume issue

73.49 --> 82.78899999999999
Midway while I was going so today again

78.06 --> 88.08
well it's not been that rainy really but

82.789 --> 91.44
still just as clouded it's nice it's a

88.08 --> 94.759
bit moist no it's nice and fresh

91.44 --> 100.95
actually had a bit of a workout earlier

94.759 --> 104.64
it was good that helps against the

100.95 --> 109.409
nausea apparently so

104.64 --> 111.45
I guess that the that impulse which

109.409 --> 114.659
seems to be very physical in nature

111.45 --> 116.52000000000001
which is causing my nausea I even tested

114.659 --> 120.17
it with the gamers oh yeah by the way I

116.52 --> 125.31
had a amazing game yesterday

120.17 --> 129.36
it was so good was a real climax for our

125.31 --> 133.44
situation that that was created like

129.36 --> 137.31
three years ago it was cool I'll tell

133.44 --> 141.209
you all about it but first yeah I think

137.31 --> 144.6
that like I said before it seems like I

141.209 --> 146.76
get this nausea trouble of my spirit

144.6 --> 150.019
keeping anchored in my body and it seems

146.76 --> 154.44
to be related to falling in love

150.019 --> 155.85
hormones and that kind of situation so

154.44 --> 158.67
it might have been accidentally

155.85 --> 163.68
triggered without my conscious consent

158.67 --> 165.85
basically and also that's why weirdly

163.68 --> 168.16
enough alcohol makes it go away while

165.85 --> 171.73
every other form of nausea that I'm used

168.16 --> 176.47
to including tension it actually

171.73 --> 178.89999999999998
aggravates it so but I'm basically

176.47 --> 180.07
approaching this like a psychology right

178.9 --> 186.37
now I'm just saying yeah it's just

180.07 --> 188.79999999999998
symptoms I have to work with it but

186.37 --> 191.89000000000001
that's just fine there's actually

188.8 --> 195.55
advantages to it it's weird being in

191.89 --> 197.64999999999998
love or if you really dedicate it like

195.55 --> 199.96
you go for it like somebody yeah that's

197.65 --> 206.46
the full swing but even if it just gets

199.96 --> 208.9
triggered it does bring some interesting

206.46 --> 212.02
interactions that come out of it

208.9 --> 218.23000000000002
so anyway hmm

212.02 --> 223.38
I got Tamera coffee again tea and a

218.23 --> 229.98999999999998
banana the one from yesterday actually

223.38 --> 232.78

229.99 --> 237.69
I see the miss Kang their AGM Ragnar

232.78 --> 247.99

bacon yeah hello good to see you all ah

255.57 --> 262.32
okay that's good to hear I am your

257.92 --> 262.32
morning commute show can kappa

271.63 --> 280.71999999999997
right the game yesterday it was good it

278.92 --> 283.3
was pretty much a stage play and

280.72 --> 287.32000000000005
everybody felt it coming it was

283.3 --> 291.27000000000004
something I had planned and moved groups

287.32 --> 295.39
for into position for this to

291.27 --> 299.46999999999997
accidentally unfold by mere chance of

295.39 --> 304.65999999999997
fate which was in this case also

299.47 --> 307.36
prophesized so it was very interesting

304.66 --> 310.15000000000003
to to see the culmination of it and

307.36 --> 314.19
basically came down to the one of the

310.15 --> 318.64
players the the shabby guy the half elf

314.19 --> 320.32
half-orc had a cursed sword that was

318.64 --> 325.78
made by his father and that he had a

320.32 --> 328.09
very yea strong Sion connection with is

325.78 --> 330.90999999999997
very powerful but it does make ya

328.09 --> 335.97999999999996
emphasize the hatred of his elven side

330.91 --> 337.54
and those other elves and yeah the party

335.98 --> 339.52000000000004
has just been working with it kind of

337.54 --> 341.74
like ignoring it and because the guy

339.52 --> 344.02
doesn't have a load of confidence so

341.74 --> 346.35
it's very easily dissuaded from doing

344.02 --> 349.09
things so that's how it kind of worked

346.35 --> 352.63
the year they really just abused the

349.09 --> 358.21
curse really but now because that curse

352.63 --> 361.12
of his father who is basically become

358.21 --> 363.48999999999995
merged with the sword like his spirit on

361.12 --> 367.33
the other side is tied in with that

363.49 --> 370.35
sword immortal is bound by it it's it's

367.33 --> 373.65999999999997
very I used the the feel of the Saronic

370.35 --> 376.6
the Sauron the Lord of the Rings type

373.66 --> 378.94
setup but it's not a world and golfing

376.6 --> 383.86
thing it's really a personal grudge that

378.94 --> 389.41
that caused it because coral is his

383.86 --> 393.25
father a very strong powerful orc not a

389.41 --> 395.17
tribe leader but just a village defender

393.25 --> 399.28
an orc that had an amazing amount of

395.17 --> 402.52000000000004
logos for an orc you could say was in

399.28 --> 405.21999999999997
love with an elf and that elf they'd

402.52 --> 407.83
basically now recently

405.22 --> 410.38000000000005
not only just in the conversation at as

407.83 --> 416.08
it happened so it was a late revelation

410.38 --> 418.99
that the Archdruid which has become the

416.08 --> 423.55
curse bound rival of the father of

418.99 --> 426.01
Corrales was in love with his wife which

423.55 --> 427.84000000000003
was an elf and founded an abomination so

426.01 --> 435.55
there was a whole road a racist thing

427.84 --> 439.17999999999995
elf versus orc and yeah basically sought

435.55 --> 442.24
out did to take destroy the abomination

439.18 --> 444.52
as an egg setting an example for the

442.24 --> 446.77
rest of the elf which is quite a bit of

444.52 --> 448.87
a dark act but yes the orcs and the

446.77 --> 450.43
elves have always been at war and even

448.87 --> 452.8
though he the guy is annexed so it's

450.43 --> 457.3
like the tragic exception it's kind of

452.8 --> 462.94
liberal in a way but yeah that kind of

457.3 --> 466.21000000000004
story set up and well they met because

462.94 --> 468.46
of the war between the Dark Elves which

466.21 --> 471.15999999999997
are a secret allies the underground

468.46 --> 472.84
allies of the topside elves the elana

471.16 --> 476.74
door elves of which the Arch Druid is

472.84 --> 479.56
the leader because those basically were

476.74 --> 480.82
triggered to go at at full war with the

479.56 --> 482.38
dwarfs we for which they have been

480.82 --> 487.62
preparing for a long time

482.38 --> 487.62
and now that the dwarfs have violated a

488.31 --> 492.4
non-intervention agreement pretty

490.18 --> 495.28000000000003
unspoken on intervention agreement with

492.4 --> 498.34
the by trading with the orcs the elves

495.28 --> 502.80999999999995
have unleashed yeah the dark elves the

498.34 --> 505.17999999999995
other side and the arch to it which was

502.81 --> 507.52
seeking an ally an alliance with the

505.18 --> 510.96
humans the and the King that had just

507.52 --> 515.02
arrived there to consecrate the city and

510.96 --> 516.81
yeah inaugurate the village to a city

515.02 --> 521.14
you came there in a hurry

516.81 --> 523.4789999999999
so basically warning him like yeah all

521.14 --> 525.88
hell is about to break loose but don't

523.479 --> 528.07
fight the elves they're not going to

525.88 --> 530.62
attack you but you're gonna have to

528.07 --> 532.5100000000001
basically choose our side because

530.62 --> 533.7090000000001
they're going to be at war and you're

532.51 --> 535.36
going to be sucked up in it and you

533.709 --> 538.03
can't handle it with the meager force

535.36 --> 538.8100000000001
you have here so side with us form an

538.03 --> 542.3199999999999
alliance but

538.81 --> 545.7399999999999
then corylus he was there he was right

542.32 --> 550.12
next to it and that felt like a total

545.74 --> 552.39
betrayal to him it was all kinds of

550.12 --> 555.61
wrong and the rest didn't like it either

552.39 --> 557.59
but yeah King was there and they

555.61 --> 559.66
couldn't just do anything but corylus

557.59 --> 564.07
been caught cursed bound by his sort

559.66 --> 567.91
that for a weird for a weird reason it's

564.07 --> 570.88
like the the one ring reason it just did

567.91 --> 573.13
nobody noticed it was there it's

570.88 --> 576.13
powerful but nobody really noticed they

573.13 --> 579.34
just it eluded them literally in-game I

576.13 --> 581.47
rolled spot checks for the big

579.34 --> 583.21
characters which pretty good if they

581.47 --> 585.64
notice and it just rolled really low so

583.21 --> 588.1600000000001
they literally buy the dices accident

585.64 --> 591.43
just didn't notice it's it's kind of

588.16 --> 596.85
interesting how how the dice can do all

591.43 --> 600.31
these weird things do the story and well

596.85 --> 603.4300000000001
he just charged at him just like yeah

600.31 --> 604.9599999999999
I'm or well wanted to charge no wait I

603.43 --> 606.31
got it wrong he wanted to church the

604.96 --> 608.44
other stopped him the bard

606.31 --> 612.16
the halfling bard which is like a super

608.44 --> 614.85
silver tongue smooth them out made him

612.16 --> 619.0
passive about it but then the Arch Druid

614.85 --> 621.97
recognized the sword and then was

619.0 --> 623.17
shocked and got into an arrogance fit

621.97 --> 627.01
like oh my god

623.17 --> 630.4799999999999
you're that son you look pathetic you

627.01 --> 632.83
look ugly and he was just in a total

630.48 --> 634.66
yeah how do you say he has a lot of

632.83 --> 637.45
power but and he knew about the curse

634.66 --> 639.88
but he was disappointed at CS finally

637.45 --> 645.0400000000001
meeting his arch nemesis like oh my god

639.88 --> 648.1899999999999
it's you that is so pathetic and yeah

645.04 --> 650.26
then the sparks literally started flying

648.19 --> 653.6500000000001
and like the curse was suddenly

650.26 --> 656.29
unleashed and they got bound by a an

653.65 --> 657.75
arcane energy field I was Unleashed

656.29 --> 661.75
because of the curse that would

657.75 --> 665.41
gradually cocoon them in like a like a

661.75 --> 667.18
plasma field or sparks yeah literally in

665.41 --> 670.9
my imagination something very magical

667.18 --> 672.6099999999999
like if maybe it could be compared to

670.9 --> 676.48
for example the final

672.61 --> 679.0600000000001
merger thing from Star Trek 1 the first

676.48 --> 681.5790000000001
movie where VG merged with the with the

679.06 --> 684.43
guy that kind of it's like a real

681.579 --> 688.2399999999999
serious [ __ ] thing happens and also

684.43 --> 690.399
earthquake start up and so yeah Corrales

688.24 --> 695.17
transforms into his dad which happens

690.399 --> 697.36
when he draws elf blood with his sword

695.17 --> 700.209
he literally transforms into a giant

697.36 --> 705.19
berserk king or his father that they

700.209 --> 707.3499999999999
switch and they go at it and the Arch

705.19 --> 709.57
Druid turns into a very large green

707.35 --> 712.72
dragon and it's literally a titanic

709.57 --> 714.97
battle in a set energy bubble and the

712.72 --> 717.13
players are like trying to help out but

714.97 --> 719.529
they can get through with their magical

717.13 --> 722.079
spells and it's like oh [ __ ] what do we

719.529 --> 724.36
do the king is escaping his advisor

722.079 --> 727.209
immediately recognized what was going on

724.36 --> 730.269
and just said no we got to go right away

727.209 --> 733.56
security basically because he knows okay

730.269 --> 736.149
the place is probably gonna explode and

733.56 --> 738.91
that is where the session ended and now

736.149 --> 740.89
I gave my player coriolis the the option

738.91 --> 743.3199999999999
okay what are you going to do he this

740.89 --> 747.699
curse could potentially literally end

743.32 --> 750.6700000000001
his life and bring him to the orcish

747.699 --> 753.64
Walhalla to which the curse will send

750.67 --> 757.17
him and it will be over or he could

753.64 --> 759.699
literally cower down at the last minute

757.17 --> 763.54
which would be typical for his sweet

759.699 --> 767.1899999999999
Weasley character in the face of the orc

763.54 --> 770.3499999999999
elders and literally be ejected like

767.19 --> 773.1400000000001
okay you don't want the honor of being

770.35 --> 776.8290000000001
in Walhalla or Kahala well don't piss

773.14 --> 778.66
off be a ejected like that and released

776.829 --> 782.5
from the curse of his father that way

778.66 --> 783.9399999999999
and so I'm gave him the option okay you

782.5 --> 786.91
decide what you want you want a new

783.94 --> 789.519
character or do you want to continue on

786.91 --> 793.329
and find a new a character change with

789.519 --> 796.24
this guy so it was a great session sorry

793.329 --> 800.29
this took so long to explain it if it

796.24 --> 803.61
was a real energy fountain for me to do

800.29 --> 803.61
that the players enjoyed it too

804.25 --> 810.76
it was epic quite literally to level

808.25 --> 813.59
twenty characters going at it with a

810.76 --> 818.33
lifetime curse somebody being unleashed

813.59 --> 820.25
and the place is gonna blow up seriously

818.33 --> 823.5200000000001
I'm not I didn't even tell the players

820.25 --> 825.5
yet but after they die like big

823.52 --> 827.5699999999999
earthquakes and the dam is gonna rupture

825.5 --> 829.81
the entire city is gonna be flooded and

827.57 --> 833.0600000000001
then the dwarfs are gonna be cut off and

829.81 --> 834.89
it's gonna be a giant disaster all over

833.06 --> 840.8599999999999
the dwarf and Empire which are gonna

834.89 --> 842.15
then be attacked and yeah I'm leaving it

840.86 --> 843.65
up to the place what they're gonna do if

842.15 --> 849.11
they're gonna scramble or feed they're

843.65 --> 852.37
gonna split apart but it's the end of

849.11 --> 857.1800000000001
that era after that everything changes

852.37 --> 860.21
and the orcs the real orc

857.18 --> 863.12
yeah the first big orc war where they go

860.21 --> 865.6700000000001
through the elephant forest and Leonard

863.12 --> 868.04
or will inevitably because the Arch

865.67 --> 869.93
Druid is now destroyed the elves are

868.04 --> 872.39
gonna panic as soon as they find out and

869.93 --> 874.4599999999999
that just literally gonna retreat to

872.39 --> 876.22
their giant wall and weaponize it so

874.46 --> 878.9300000000001
nothing could ever get through it and

876.22 --> 881.51
that means that the orcs are then gonna

878.93 --> 885.88
march through because secretly as nobody

881.51 --> 889.55
literally knows the giant orc general

885.88 --> 892.61
wants to actually get to the sea and

889.55 --> 896.12
then attack the humans because in the

892.61 --> 899.75
far far past has been passed down story

896.12 --> 901.76
by story the humans once enslaved the

899.75 --> 903.86
orcs there and they're still orc slaves

901.76 --> 907.79
still and the human Empire did not a lot

903.86 --> 910.0
and they want to basically conquer the

907.79 --> 916.52
world so that's gonna be a new big play

910.0 --> 919.25
going out and man no PJ I never read The

916.52 --> 922.81
Silmarillion I have heard of it and it

919.25 --> 925.91
was I've seen parts of it but it almost

922.81 --> 930.3699999999999
nauseated me how overkill everything was

925.91 --> 935.639
it's so over the top that it's like

930.37 --> 935.639
it's it's almost too much

941.81 --> 948.56
I definitely do not try to reach that

944.06 --> 951.38
level because when you go that type of

948.56 --> 953.6899999999999
epic and it can technically be done in

951.38 --> 958.09
the D&D world if you invite the deities

953.69 --> 962.6300000000001
you'll get things from level 30 to level

958.09 --> 965.6
70 or a hundred and then everything is

962.63 --> 968.39
just totally fluid because a character

965.6 --> 971.36
like that could literally just mold the

968.39 --> 975.86
freaking plane matter with their mind

971.36 --> 980.9300000000001
it's just not a healthy thing for a game

975.86 --> 983.12
world but if that can be things done

980.93 --> 984.89
with it especially if you approach the

983.12 --> 990.26
deities situation if you're going to

984.89 --> 993.47
involve them do it by contracts make a

990.26 --> 997.16
contract system the the gods must have

993.47 --> 998.9300000000001
laws and must have bets and arguments

997.16 --> 1003.36
that is how it works it's basically the

998.93 --> 1006.25
how the Greeks portrayed their

1003.36 --> 1008.62
mythological Pantheon as well it's the

1006.25 --> 1015.31
only way you can really get that kind of

1008.62 --> 1017.77
thing evolved and by the way the gods in

1015.31 --> 1021.0889999999999
this sense are not the Creator it's not

1017.77 --> 1024.43
the thing that is the entire they are

1021.089 --> 1027.55
just figures that because yeah they are

1024.43 --> 1029.65
pretty much satanic kings you could

1027.55 --> 1032.62
almost say or not snatches necessarily

1029.65 --> 1035.52
said they become like Nephilim they

1032.62 --> 1038.26
become just wielders of the realm and

1035.52 --> 1043.03
they sit on that throne there is like a

1038.26 --> 1047.47
throne of control for every realm except

1043.03 --> 1050.8899999999999
the Material Plane strangely enough the

1047.47 --> 1055.26
dad look into the Indy cosmology it is

1050.89 --> 1059.26
pretty elaborate and surreal and

1055.26 --> 1062.23
fascinating how they devise that and

1059.26 --> 1064.54
also very fascinating is that even as I

1062.23 --> 1068.77
hear for example my healer explained

1064.54 --> 1071.11
certain frequency things to me and now I

1068.77 --> 1073.41
can't help but notice but he does

1071.11 --> 1075.6599999999999
constantly bring in the concept of

1073.41 --> 1079.41
planets and I can literally feel that

1075.66 --> 1083.76
he's visualizing them as planets but it

1079.41 --> 1086.6100000000001
I think it's not in a physical outer

1083.76 --> 1088.56
space realm when he fantasizes that it's

1086.61 --> 1091.4399999999998
it's a weird experience to see it I

1088.56 --> 1093.1799999999998
basically try to ignore it because he's

1091.44 --> 1095.19
working with things that do work and

1093.18 --> 1097.3400000000001
however he projects them that's his

1095.19 --> 1102.21
that's his prerogative that's his choice

1097.34 --> 1106.1699999999998
it works for him but I know I'm losing

1102.21 --> 1113.19
track wait no yes I am just noticing

1106.17 --> 1115.47
that when my healer explains origins of

1113.19 --> 1120.0900000000001
certain entities for example how that

1115.47 --> 1124.98
works it just reminds me a lot in big

1120.09 --> 1127.9199999999998
cosmology it is so weird to recognize

1124.98 --> 1129.99
that I don't mention it and I'm not even

1127.92 --> 1134.1200000000001
going to get overly enthusiastic about

1129.99 --> 1134.1200000000001
it but it is fascinating to see that

1134.33 --> 1141.06
what he naturally wields with when he's

1137.79 --> 1146.1599999999999
doing the ethereal things just seems to

1141.06 --> 1148.62
match the pattern so much it is really

1146.16 --> 1150.93
really fascinating how so many of these

1148.62 --> 1154.4399999999998
things are just pre constructed and

1150.93 --> 1159.39
there's evidence that many occultists

1154.44 --> 1161.7
just work with these things and have

1159.39 --> 1163.98
done so secretly and have placed

1161.7 --> 1167.9
information about them in plain sight

1163.98 --> 1173.79
that normal people just can't recognize

1167.9 --> 1177.5900000000001
now that's real occultism when it's not

1173.79 --> 1177.59
with numbers I'll tell you that

1184.69 --> 1191.99
so ya got really off-track here

1187.61 --> 1194.24
D&D and into comparing the D&D cosmology

1191.99 --> 1198.86
with how my Heat are sometimes

1194.24 --> 1205.519
approaches ethereal things but yeah it

1198.86 --> 1207.049
is all very similar a lot of it not

1205.519 --> 1208.8990000000001
everything there are definitely things

1207.049 --> 1215.84
out of place

1208.899 --> 1219.0189999999998
also in D&D I mean it is definitely not

1215.84 --> 1221.9599999999998
a an absolute like a pure thing

1219.019 --> 1226.029
absolutely not it's just an amalgamation

1221.96 --> 1228.919
of so many things and ideas and ethereal

1226.029 --> 1231.35
experiences pretty sure that many of

1228.919 --> 1235.5800000000002
these people had freaking hallucinogens

1231.35 --> 1237.32
and have probably done absolute wide

1235.58 --> 1240.049
studies of all mythologies from

1237.32 --> 1242.83
everywhere because you can find

1240.049 --> 1248.289
mythology elements from literally

1242.83 --> 1248.289
everywhere in the world Japanese Chinese

1251.289 --> 1262.309
you have more Slavic type things

1256.1 --> 1266.2099999999998
the Irish elements NATO or an F Africa

1262.309 --> 1268.369
it's just things designs are plucked

1266.21 --> 1273.95
from everywhere and then sometimes

1268.369 --> 1277.399
combined just mixed in a little it but

1273.95 --> 1280.429
they built from every almost every

1277.399 --> 1284.149
conceivable myth that is kind of

1280.429 --> 1286.009
historical and they have their own weird

1284.149 --> 1289.5089999999998
little unique creations that are

1286.009 --> 1289.509
trademarks and everything

1304.57 --> 1318.799
that's fair schema that is that is

1309.379 --> 1323.629
uncanny Mason be the lack of pair like

1318.799 --> 1326.179
Oh God you you got to go through like

1323.629 --> 1328.4289999999999
every time I hear that freaking parallax

1326.179 --> 1331.219
thing I think I have got it at certain

1328.429 --> 1331.8490000000002
types but I keep forgetting what that's

1331.219 --> 1337.549
about

1331.849 --> 1340.029
it's annoying and they just google the

1337.549 --> 1340.029
damn word

1359.0 --> 1361.809
okay

1362.72 --> 1367.96
right so different angle look

1372.72 --> 1376.38
I'm not getting in

1390.75 --> 1406.96
all right well Zep tepi there are some

1402.15 --> 1410.68
creatures that have resemblances for

1406.96 --> 1412.96
example to typical Hindu gods all not

1410.68 --> 1418.0900000000001
that much but there yeah there's just

1412.96 --> 1424.54
all kinds of things in D&D related to

1418.09 --> 1426.85
everything I don't see yeah although the

1424.54 --> 1432.6399999999999
look the elephants and the giant turtle

1426.85 --> 1434.23
is an obvious philosophical approach you

1432.64 --> 1437.3500000000001
do realize that there has been no

1434.23 --> 1440.22
witness or evidence even proclaimed for

1437.35 --> 1440.2199999999998
this right

1440.49 --> 1445.54
nobody's ever confirmed that and that

1443.59 --> 1448.78
used to be a big thing in the old Hindu

1445.54 --> 1450.52
times they had a lot of scientists they

1448.78 --> 1455.7
freaking figure out the charts of the

1450.52 --> 1455.7
heavens how that worked back then

1458.02 --> 1464.08
so I don't think anybody they never

1460.57 --> 1466.6899999999998
figured that out so they just made that

1464.08 --> 1472.6299999999999
story as an answer so people stop asking

1466.69 --> 1476.65
and I think that they that they're

1472.63 --> 1479.429
probably pretty open about it that that

1476.65 --> 1479.429
is the case

1488.999 --> 1495.74
all right

1490.88 --> 1499.5200000000002
yeah but look the turtle and the

1495.74 --> 1503.44
elephants have nothing to do with the

1499.52 --> 1507.11
nature of our realm it is just an answer

1503.44 --> 1510.38
to something they never managed to

1507.11 --> 1513.4699999999998
figure out so it is an answer to fill in

1510.38 --> 1516.1100000000001
the blank for people to stop asking has

1513.47 --> 1523.93
nothing to do with the earth not being a

1516.11 --> 1523.9299999999998
ball though did it's just the way it is

1524.65 --> 1530.8700000000001
no I think ballers bring it bring forth

1528.35 --> 1533.27
the whole elephant and turtle situation

1530.87 --> 1537.34
a lot more than flat-earthers do in

1533.27 --> 1537.34
their actual arguments so

1542.21 --> 1551.9
right yeah Hannah bear D and D stands

1545.79 --> 1551.8999999999999
for Dungeons and Dragons ooh yeah it's

1552.679 --> 1558.9
two things well you have to see where it

1556.679 --> 1561.24
originates from what the original game

1558.9 --> 1564.66
was it's very old so I'll game from the

1561.24 --> 1567.179
freakin 60s okay man Christians were so

1564.66 --> 1569.25
paranoid about it like that but yeah

1567.179 --> 1572.2800000000002
there were some pretty creepy things

1569.25 --> 1575.07
like there were adventures with demons

1572.28 --> 1577.71
that did almost spells that have Airy

1575.07 --> 1579.6899999999998
similarity to real occult rituals and

1577.71 --> 1584.64
all that [ __ ] so there is something to

1579.69 --> 1588.66
that but not somebody they I think they

1584.64 --> 1590.67
mostly just took that out and made it

1588.66 --> 1593.8400000000001
into a more pure fantasy realm not

1590.67 --> 1597.929
getting the real occult involved as much

1593.84 --> 1599.85
but yeah it stands for the ancient

1597.929 --> 1602.01
dragons because that was kind of the

1599.85 --> 1604.9199999999998
original setup it is you have players

1602.01 --> 1607.92
you have just a bunch of squares tunnels

1604.92 --> 1610.8000000000002
with rooms you move through them you

1607.92 --> 1612.66
move to the final boss or the where the

1610.8 --> 1614.46
treasure is and there's a dragon there

1612.66 --> 1617.8200000000002
that's usually the like the biggest

1614.46 --> 1620.52
baddest enemy there was so Dungeons and

1617.82 --> 1627.74
Dragons and that's how they made that

1620.52 --> 1627.74
name they made it very direct

1629.38 --> 1644.7700000000002
right 1974 right but yeah you can get

1642.58 --> 1648.1599999999999
all paranoid about the old dungeons of

1644.77 --> 1650.32
course because yeah look dungeons and oh

1648.16 --> 1653.14
look at the Dragons its you can

1650.32 --> 1656.59
conspiracies the [ __ ] out of those names

1653.14 --> 1660.7
concerning this age oh let me tell you I

1656.59 --> 1663.85
made my own kind of like an update an

1660.7 --> 1668.559
enhancement or in an evolution an

1663.85 --> 1672.1
adaptation I try to refine elements of

1668.559 --> 1675.01
D&D add some to create a more balanced

1672.1 --> 1676.6
system for my world and I used that

1675.01 --> 1682.33
system you know what I called it I

1676.6 --> 1690.51
called it trolls and tyrants I figured

1682.33 --> 1694.09
out that name in 2009 I think yeah so

1690.51 --> 1696.97
yeah I thought it was kind of

1694.09 --> 1701.289
appropriate since those two things seem

1696.97 --> 1703.659
to be the most prevalent things in

1701.289 --> 1706.539
people's hearts and minds is age this

1703.659 --> 1709.179
age you know everybody's obsessed by the

1706.539 --> 1712.87
tyrants and everybody's getting mauled

1709.179 --> 1715.3300000000002
by the trolls everywhere so trolls and

1712.87 --> 1720.1
tyrants that's what I named it it's

1715.33 --> 1722.1689999999999
still kind of the same game now just

1720.1 --> 1724.3799999999999
more technically refined in my humble

1722.169 --> 1724.38
opinion

1731.09 --> 1735.33
[Music]

1732.529 --> 1737.659
yeah and it's pretty explosive I can

1735.33 --> 1737.6589999999999
tell you

1752.55 --> 1772.21
so yeah that's that's my weapon I made

1756.46 --> 1777.1000000000001
that no wait not oh yeah in correct the

1772.21 --> 1779.14
actual website was made in 2014 but the

1777.1 --> 1787.81
works for it I was working on it since

1779.14 --> 1789.7
2008 pretty much anyway it's it's really

1787.81 --> 1792.9099999999999
not all that interesting if you're not

1789.7 --> 1795.82
into D&D because mostly it's just a

1792.91 --> 1798.01
database of all the technical rules so

1795.82 --> 1801.4299999999998
it's all technical there's not a lot of

1798.01 --> 1805.18
story in it although there are some but

1801.43 --> 1807.6100000000001
yeah anyway that yeah I kind of wanted

1805.18 --> 1809.89
to be a game designer you know really

1807.61 --> 1812.86
seriously I have for a long time I just

1809.89 --> 1816.5500000000002
never got to be a good programmer

1812.86 --> 1818.9199999999998
I have many unfinished projects or

1816.55 --> 1820.93
rather kind of finished in there

1818.92 --> 1824.29
blueprint but I just never got a

1820.93 --> 1827.8600000000001
programmer to basically help me out

1824.29 --> 1830.82
voluntarily I never had money we did to

1827.86 --> 1830.82
do anything like that

1838.21 --> 1841.78
but I even have ideas for computer games

1841.07 --> 1846.95
right now

1841.78 --> 1850.76
with the need like very basic concepts

1846.95 --> 1853.3400000000001
that would yield a a like a new platform

1850.76 --> 1856.8799999999999
for this age that's very dynamic and

1853.34 --> 1859.34
just for which it would be very easy to

1856.88 --> 1863.3300000000002
even provide an editor so you can make

1859.34 --> 1867.6399999999999
your own game levels really easily and

1863.33 --> 1871.25
just it would be like a digital Legos

1867.64 --> 1875.74
with D&D and that's kind of what I had

1871.25 --> 1875.74
in mind for a long time

1888.88 --> 1895.8100000000002
no PJ I'm not gonna let you waste my

1892.63 --> 1902.41
time anymore with just you red herring

1895.81 --> 1905.4099999999999
everything you go and freakin look for

1902.41 --> 1908.97
your your darkest clues and all that

1905.41 --> 1908.97
okay I know your story

1916.45 --> 1919.6200000000001
make my own music

1926.22 --> 1932.97
I don't know I think I'm too much of a

1929.1 --> 1937.34
I'm too much of a critic to do that I

1932.97 --> 1941.1000000000001
think to the proper music maker you'd

1937.34 --> 1946.549
you just would be making that like a

1941.1 --> 1946.549
game and then you'd become really good

1951.22 --> 1959.29
wait did Amanda young did you get my

1954.55 --> 1964.1499999999999
super chat message where I didn't see it

1959.29 --> 1965.77
oh wait oh oh my god I completely missed

1964.15 --> 1970.0500000000002
that sorry Amanda young right

1965.77 --> 1973.15
ah say it I was too busy talking I think

1970.05 --> 1974.74
but anyway thank you for the $5 super

1973.15 --> 1978.5800000000002
chat donation if you're falling in love

1974.74 --> 1982.45
go for it all right now god no thank you

1978.58 --> 1988.9499999999998
for the advice but no no I'm not in a

1982.45 --> 1991.78
hurry you know been there done that I

1988.95 --> 1996.8400000000001
think I'm gonna be a little bit more

1991.78 --> 1996.84
careful now I'm not 20 anymore

2022.12 --> 2025.84
what do you mean hm

2042.22 --> 2047.17
yeah I was kind of wondering the same

2045.76 --> 2053.83
thing yesterday dak

2047.17 --> 2060.16
where is leb we haven't seen him in a

2053.83 --> 2062.89
while maybe he's just found a new thing

2060.16 --> 2067.27
to dig into and it just doesn't have any

2062.89 --> 2070.15
time anymore for this maybe got a like a

2067.27 --> 2073.3
really cool new job maybe a job offer or

2070.15 --> 2078.61
something or maybe he fell in love with

2073.3 --> 2080.86
the new girl you know I don't know but

2078.61 --> 2083.429
I'm curious too about where leb is

2080.86 --> 2083.429
hanging around

2103.96 --> 2109.26
oh god no thanks for that nice and be

2107.7 --> 2115.5989999999997
well

2109.26 --> 2119.17
look it's been building for a while and

2115.599 --> 2122.4100000000003
it was look I've had trouble with Randy

2119.17 --> 2125.4700000000003
kind of before but because hey we were

2122.41 --> 2127.48
of the Flat Earth debate team always

2125.47 --> 2130.48
kind of like tolerated them as they

2127.48 --> 2136.079
tolerated some of my more quirky sides

2130.48 --> 2139.9900000000002
as well so but ever since that time

2136.079 --> 2142.0890000000004
where I kind of got sick of qyz behavior

2139.99 --> 2145.4199999999996
and he got sick of it and he stepped

2142.089 --> 2147.69
away it seems and he started to do his

2145.42 --> 2152.16
own show and almost interesting concept

2147.69 --> 2154.69
but he's just changed somehow

2152.16 --> 2157.359
since that moment and started to behave

2154.69 --> 2160.2400000000002
differently and act differently and I

2157.359 --> 2163.7999999999997
don't like it I didn't I don't like it

2160.24 --> 2167.9199999999996
what he's doing it feels disingenuous

2163.8 --> 2176.819
was doing it's I don't know what he's

2167.92 --> 2179.65
doing but it it doesn't feel good and

2176.819 --> 2182.89
I'm I've been trying to deal with that

2179.65 --> 2188.02
and and approach it somehow address it

2182.89 --> 2191.5589999999997
without blowing everything up but then

2188.02 --> 2193.54
in that situation with super schema

2191.559 --> 2194.9500000000003
where I'm clearly taking a stand and

2193.54 --> 2197.43
bringing forth

2194.95 --> 2202.6189999999997
Becky being very clear about my stand

2197.43 --> 2206.14
standpoint and Randi is then joining in

2202.619 --> 2212.77
whispers chemo to literally Gaslight me

2206.14 --> 2218.799
about things and I find that extremely

2212.77 --> 2223.23
offensive that's it's on the same level

2218.799 --> 2226.48
as what Jose did when he flip-flop

2223.23 --> 2229.53
except I don't know this is kind of

2226.48 --> 2229.53
worse in a way

2232.65 --> 2240.4900000000002
because Jose at least has since been

2236.38 --> 2242.559
trying to be really nice to me and he's

2240.49 --> 2244.99
he's kind of aware of what he's doing

2242.559 --> 2247.7200000000003
and just going with that choice kind of

2244.99 --> 2250.6299999999997
honestly still trying to be as honest as

2247.72 --> 2254.3089999999997
he can and I don't know if Randi even

2250.63 --> 2254.309
realizes what where he's gone

2269.31 --> 2286.27
okay dart sloth of all is that so mason

2275.5 --> 2289.18
bee seems kind of a accusation can you

2286.27 --> 2292.66
confirm that mason bee what Lord

2289.18 --> 2295.0499999999997
stuffable is saying or is he talking out

2292.66 --> 2295.0499999999997
of his ass

2309.79 --> 2319.7799999999997
right but comedic value aside is it true

2314.41 --> 2322.48
or is it not true I think I'm gonna put

2319.78 --> 2329.4700000000003
you on the spot here with that so you're

2322.48 --> 2334.5
just gonna have to say yes or no I'm

2329.47 --> 2334.5
sure he's trolling it's not true okay

2338.04 --> 2341.2799999999997
all right

2357.95 --> 2366.68
so anyway I hope that cleared up some

2361.67 --> 2369.7000000000003
issues for for that why why I stepped

2366.68 --> 2369.7
away from Randy

2382.6 --> 2390.2799999999997
all right and you may remember from

2385.42 --> 2393.16
yesterday if you seen it that he in a

2390.28 --> 2394.78
very similar fashion to what right to

2393.16 --> 2396.73
hand tries to do and what he's been

2394.78 --> 2399.25
trying to do why he's quit by the way

2396.73 --> 2401.35
quit messaging me I think he got tired

2399.25 --> 2406.75
from Inori figured out that was kind of

2401.35 --> 2409.0899999999997
dumb to do that but yeah right hand

2406.75 --> 2411.7
really attack me personally tried to

2409.09 --> 2414.79
Gaslight me try to make me feel very bad

2411.7 --> 2417.0099999999998
about myself full-on personal attack

2414.79 --> 2423.0099999999998
total savanna a shameless Savannah

2417.01 --> 2429.4500000000003
action and ran T in my jet was doing the

2423.01 --> 2431.13
same thing like an old [ __ ] like an old

2429.45 --> 2434.52
pissed-off

2431.13 --> 2434.52
manipulative woman

2441.59 --> 2446.8700000000003
[Music]

2443.3 --> 2449.6400000000003
and that's a Vanya and that's just so

2446.87 --> 2452.64
incredibly embarrassing like if I catch

2449.64 --> 2456.08
myself acting like that I'd be nauseated

2452.64 --> 2459.12
afterwards and as quickly as possible

2456.08 --> 2460.77
correct my behavior in public like oh my

2459.12 --> 2464.0
god I can't believe I actually did

2460.77 --> 2469.74
something like that that is really sad

2464.0 --> 2472.86
although I do sometimes get pretty you

2469.74 --> 2475.02
say direct and hostile you could say

2472.86 --> 2478.1400000000003
potentially hostile with other people

2475.02 --> 2480.35
when they get nasty with me that happens

2478.14 --> 2483.8599999999997
but everything has a time in a place and

2480.35 --> 2487.5899999999997
I don't think I warranted that kind of

2483.86 --> 2490.6200000000003
action because I'm not trying to

2487.59 --> 2493.8
personally attack ranty I constantly say

2490.62 --> 2498.33
look I respect his work he's a working

2493.8 --> 2503.0
man takes that very seriously and he has

2498.33 --> 2506.04
done a lot for flat earth in general but

2503.0 --> 2513.63
the integrity part the choices that he

2506.04 --> 2518.07
makes just because there's a good side I

2513.63 --> 2522.81
can't ignore when the rest is breaking

2518.07 --> 2523.67
down in my view when he's making a

2522.81 --> 2526.14
mistake

2523.67 --> 2528.75
that's probably the best way to say it

2526.14 --> 2532.0499999999997
it feels like a friend of mine is making

2528.75 --> 2535.5
a mistake and when I try to point at it

2532.05 --> 2537.48
it gets hostile and it feels like he's

2535.5 --> 2539.4
no longer there and he that I recognized

2537.48 --> 2544.11
I don't recognize him anymore when he's

2539.4 --> 2546.9300000000003
like this so he's turned sivan yay cuz

2544.11 --> 2549.15
that's all he's like my Empire I want to

2546.93 --> 2551.69
build my thing and compare it to others

2549.15 --> 2556.65
so I've groans rant he's grown so much

2551.69 --> 2560.01
he's so much better because I are win

2556.65 --> 2563.79
him lazy and if I just got a job then

2560.01 --> 2568.26
you will be much bigger Oh like totally

2563.79 --> 2571.82
trying to derail what I'm doing here in

2568.26 --> 2571.82
a personal attack

2572.42 --> 2578.4900000000002
while he knows that I do have yeah

2575.99 --> 2582.9199999999996
insecurities considered that because I'm

2578.49 --> 2590.0099999999998
pub and public about that I have issues

2582.92 --> 2592.28
so to just then attack that like that

2590.01 --> 2592.28
that's

2604.18 --> 2607.89
yeah

2605.97 --> 2609.81
there's a lot of comparisons I could

2607.89 --> 2614.7
make but I'm not really going to do it I

2609.81 --> 2617.73
think it's self-explanatory right and I

2614.7 --> 2619.5
do put my cards on the table with all

2617.73 --> 2623.16
the consequences that come with them

2619.5 --> 2625.79
also because if you put all the cards on

2623.16 --> 2629.31
the table you

2625.79 --> 2632.7799999999997
there is no tricking anymore and the

2629.31 --> 2632.7799999999997
plan is much more difficult

2641.49 --> 2647.97
and there is basically also and I really

2646.08 --> 2652.7599999999998
have realized that for a long time there

2647.97 --> 2657.8689999999997
is nothing preventing anyone from

2652.76 --> 2661.05
stealing my ideas and and claiming them

2657.869 --> 2665.52
as their own and just say no I invented

2661.05 --> 2668.1600000000003
this and and then you score a lot of

2665.52 --> 2671.339
Fame and maybe even money with that and

2668.16 --> 2674.75
that's a consequence of everything and

2671.339 --> 2678.2599999999998
if I had wanted to prevent then that all

2674.75 --> 2681.42
then I could have never done any of this

2678.26 --> 2685.0200000000004
then it would have all built it secretly

2681.42 --> 2687.9
and just say les crew everyone I am

2685.02 --> 2691.47
gonna absolutely leave my mark there and

2687.9 --> 2694.17
nothing is gonna stop me from it being

2691.47 --> 2696.18
me leaving that marker over there the

2694.17 --> 2699.15
only thing only mark I'm really leaving

2696.18 --> 2701.609
right now is just being on record

2699.15 --> 2704.099
putting it out there and leaving it to

2701.609 --> 2706.47
the people to decide did Arwen indeed

2704.099 --> 2708.21
come up with that first or at least did

2706.47 --> 2710.7
he come up with it naturally and maybe

2708.21 --> 2714.29
somebody else at some point also thought

2710.7 --> 2717.18
the idea and maybe left it who knows

2714.29 --> 2722.0099999999998
that's it that's the most I can get out

2717.18 --> 2724.02
of this all right but still look a lot

2722.01 --> 2725.7900000000004
of ideas that have been formed that I've

2724.02 --> 2728.55
been created here over the last few

2725.79 --> 2733.41
years there are potential projects that

2728.55 --> 2738.03
could be addressed and built finances

2733.41 --> 2740.67
for at some point so I have potential

2738.03 --> 2743.369
plans in the future I don't know how far

2740.67 --> 2747.81
it will reach technically but for enough

2743.369 --> 2751.9100000000003
for the next 80 years probably so much

2747.81 --> 2757.88
to do so many things I could do by then

2751.91 --> 2757.8799999999997
good things things that I think are good

2759.299 --> 2769.029
and if I was wrong then God will

2762.549 --> 2771.7889999999998
absolutely slap in my face but I'll see

2769.029 --> 2774.0
ya if that happens when ya as you as I

2771.789 --> 2774.0
go

2790.57 --> 2799.36
what what kind of remark is that when

2796.93 --> 2800.47
Benjamin is a flat earth Pretender

2799.36 --> 2807.1
clown-like

2800.47 --> 2811.2999999999997
re what what does that even mean the guy

2807.1 --> 2815.92
is a comedian and he's freakin smart and

2811.3 --> 2818.0800000000004
he knows a lot so I don't see him really

2815.92 --> 2820.84
being a pretender clown he's pretty open

2818.08 --> 2823.99
about how far he goes with the

2820.84 --> 2827.25
information he avoids certain things

2823.99 --> 2830.1699999999996
because it annoys the [ __ ] out of him as

2827.25 --> 2834.04
do I although at some point I just

2830.17 --> 2837.19
sometimes manage to just suddenly switch

2834.04 --> 2845.59
and be able to assimilate it luckily

2837.19 --> 2849.75
enough for me what keeper for Hollywood

2845.59 --> 2849.75
are you sick are you out of your mind

2850.59 --> 2858.4900000000002
how is he a gatekeeper for Hollywood how

2855.13 --> 2861.13
you put down the theory this is just so

2858.49 --> 2865.66
ridiculous how does that work do you

2861.13 --> 2869.34
even know what gatekeeping is again

2865.66 --> 2872.89
again with these insane accusations and

2869.34 --> 2875.32
no explanation is it time to ban some

2872.89 --> 2882.27
people again or are you actually going

2875.32 --> 2882.27
to put something forth that proves it

2885.01 --> 2906.23
band dad then but that's just a freaking

2904.13 --> 2908.53
troll I shouldn't even get upset about

2906.23 --> 2908.53
this

2924.76 --> 2933.2200000000003
I'm a really loose lovable so what if

2928.03 --> 2936.52
you think that what's the reason what is

2933.22 --> 2941.89
it about him or what he did or said that

2936.52 --> 2944.2599999999998
actually leads to that conclusion oh so

2941.89 --> 2949.2999999999997
it's just a vague feeling like I don't

2944.26 --> 2949.869
learn KITT can you pinpoint it down any

2949.3 --> 2952.8900000000003
further

2949.869 --> 2955.329
you know usually it's a couple of things

2952.89 --> 2958.99
that'll lead to that kind of feeling

2955.329 --> 2962.98
hanging around so have you tried zooming

2958.99 --> 2964.9599999999996
in on the source of that feeling then

2962.98 --> 2974.25
you may actually figure out what's going

2964.96 --> 2974.25
on don't even watch ten minutes oh okay

2975.05 --> 2978.1890000000003
[Music]

2987.5 --> 2990.849
what is going on

3014.48 --> 3017.44
okay

3020.16 --> 3027.7799999999997
all right so look how on Benjamin has

3024.96 --> 3033.14
been pretty open and honest that he did

3027.78 --> 3036.75
start in Hollywood okay and he's been

3033.14 --> 3038.7
extremely elaborately detailed about

3036.75 --> 3042.12
what that was like

3038.7 --> 3046.04
or he was faced with what he figured out

3042.12 --> 3050.18
about how things work and I've heard

3046.04 --> 3053.82
nobody else explain anything concerning

3050.18 --> 3060.4199999999996
Hollywood as elaborately as Owen

3053.82 --> 3063.4500000000003
Benjamin has okay the guy is just

3060.42 --> 3067.98
literally strategically just throwing

3063.45 --> 3073.14
out detailed data like no one else

3067.98 --> 3076.2
oh there may be some people that go

3073.14 --> 3078.42
after specific individuals and FA is it

3076.2 --> 3081.54
the testimony about something but Owen

3078.42 --> 3085.53
Benjamin is just going at it all day

3081.54 --> 3086.52
long I I just don't get it how is that a

3085.53 --> 3089.84
gatekeeper

3086.52 --> 3093.21
why is he how is he hiding he is

3089.84 --> 3098.54
exposing [ __ ] like no one else out there

3093.21 --> 3098.54
and and you think that's fake

3112.869 --> 3118.089
all right

3114.91 --> 3124.359
well Alex Jones has a lot of issues very

3118.089 --> 3126.94
obviously so is even if you just take a

3124.359 --> 3128.859
superficial look at the setup of what

3126.94 --> 3134.94
the Alex Jones Show and all that has

3128.859 --> 3137.38
become it's one giant almost weaponized

3134.94 --> 3144.2200000000003
advertisement for products that are

3137.38 --> 3149.38
actually good but it's just so it oozes

3144.22 --> 3156.009
greed it's it's overkill over

3149.38 --> 3158.7690000000002
stimulation and yeah there is that's

3156.009 --> 3161.14
that's a definite it's like a sin in

3158.769 --> 3163.359
plain sight and the of course is gonna

3161.14 --> 3166.24
spin around that forever and no look

3163.359 --> 3170.259
here's why there's why but there's

3166.24 --> 3174.1899999999996
obvious political agenda shoes and back

3170.259 --> 3176.65
and forth with that like I don't know I

3174.19 --> 3179.41
I oppose it no I'm actually for that

3176.65 --> 3182.98
there's all kinds of issues with the

3179.41 --> 3184.5989999999997
entire thing has been going for a while

3182.98 --> 3186.15
it's and I don't think it's getting any

3184.599 --> 3190.569
better

3186.15 --> 3192.67
it is what it is and if you blindly

3190.569 --> 3195.88
believe Alex Jones with everything yeah

3192.67 --> 3200.289
then you are literally a fool but there

3195.88 --> 3209.25
is still a lot of very information and

3200.289 --> 3209.25
interesting things there sometimes

3212.94 --> 3220.0
okay good if you're comparing now

3216.28 --> 3222.28
nowadays I don't watch it fully like I

3220.0 --> 3224.05
for example did 10 years ago when I

3222.28 --> 3226.69
would literally watch the whole thing

3224.05 --> 3228.7000000000003
every day because it was really good now

3226.69 --> 3231.16
I just watch on occasion I sometimes

3228.7 --> 3233.6499999999996
keep track and then when it is not

3231.16 --> 3238.2999999999997
getting it when it's like over focusing

3233.65 --> 3241.56
on um leftist politician for example and

3238.3 --> 3245.38
of course that's all relevant to that

3241.56 --> 3249.7
that category that's what they've dug

3245.38 --> 3252.7000000000003
into to doing but I personally have very

3249.7 --> 3255.96
little interest and it it's so overkill

3252.7 --> 3259.2999999999997
everything is so overdone from all sides

3255.96 --> 3265.39
it does really feel like a theater piece

3259.3 --> 3274.26
and it's even meta because it's it's

3265.39 --> 3274.2599999999998
become crazy it's a mess

3290.39 --> 3296.3599999999997
wait what are you talking about peanuts

3292.7 --> 3300.46
clerk hold judgment until after the

3296.36 --> 3307.28
conference what the Amsterdam conference

3300.46 --> 3311.8
whoo [ __ ] what what why can't I just be

3307.28 --> 3311.8
give my honest opinion about people

3339.94 --> 3350.65
well 60 watchin nice oh yeah oh wait oh

3352.45 --> 3359.48
right right peanuts Clark okay sure

3355.76 --> 3361.3900000000003
yeah there seems to be a tendency of

3359.48 --> 3369.8
being overly skeptical

3361.39 --> 3372.41
maybe a little here and there but for

3369.8 --> 3376.0600000000004
example look Owen Benjamin I've been now

3372.41 --> 3379.16
following Owen Benjamin for months and

3376.06 --> 3382.52
he's like my new guy I really like his

3379.16 --> 3385.73
show I catch it every time I can and it

3382.52 --> 3390.68
is usually totally amusing especially

3385.73 --> 3394.07
the last few weeks been awesome so I

3390.68 --> 3397.5499999999997
just like him right now but if some yeah

3394.07 --> 3399.5
I talked about it and then maybe for

3397.55 --> 3401.75
others for some of you you've decided

3399.5 --> 3406.85
like maybe I should look into it

3401.75 --> 3410.51
and then you do you get the high energy

3406.85 --> 3412.91
all that stuff and yeah weird some weird

3410.51 --> 3416.3900000000003
sensations because the guy is

3412.91 --> 3419.33
technically doing stand-up him partially

3416.39 --> 3421.5499999999997
improvised partially prepared that is

3419.33 --> 3424.5499999999997
what he does during the live stream it's

3421.55 --> 3428.1200000000003
not the way I do things it's not the

3424.55 --> 3430.6400000000003
same it's more professional for what he

3428.12 --> 3435.95
is he is a stand-up comedian and he's

3430.64 --> 3437.75
very serious with his craft and then if

3435.95 --> 3439.97
you're a newcomer yet you that may feel

3437.75 --> 3444.2
a little off if you have to understand

3439.97 --> 3447.1099999999997
that I've been watching and figuring out

3444.2 --> 3449.39
for a long time and I figured I had my

3447.11 --> 3452.54
suspicions at first as well like the

3449.39 --> 3454.3399999999997
gist is really like what is he doing is

3452.54 --> 3457.19
that really good is does he know what

3454.34 --> 3461.21
he's doing and well over time I figured

3457.19 --> 3463.2200000000003
out yes he is very aware of what he does

3461.21 --> 3467.21
and he also corrects himself he

3463.22 --> 3472.02
sometimes overshoots things and then he

3467.21 --> 3476.57
corrects it very very very well

3472.02 --> 3479.57
I have nothing but respect for the guy

3476.57 --> 3479.57
really

3483.5 --> 3488.92
although he's not perfect like nobody is

3490.21 --> 3496.67
he has his own typical personal

3493.7 --> 3500.81
character issues and is how he interacts

3496.67 --> 3503.8
with things like everybody has that in

3500.81 --> 3503.7999999999997
one way or the other

3509.02 --> 3514.91
okay yeah he has to he plays piano as

3512.81 --> 3517.09
well yeah he's very creative with all

3514.91 --> 3517.0899999999997
that

3525.09 --> 3538.1400000000003
now Roger MC the Amsterdam conference is

3528.0 --> 3541.82
not canceled Saturday's on there is no

3538.14 --> 3541.8199999999997
cancellation of Saturday

3550.38 --> 3552.4100000000003
Oh

3556.93 --> 3560.1
only I

3564.34 --> 3566.88
that

3571.02 --> 3573.86
sheesh

3574.47 --> 3584.049
okay yeah I did I did blog Julie

3580.809 --> 3588.88
Armstrong didn't I I thought was just

3584.049 --> 3591.0389999999998
going too far well she sent me a PayPal

3588.88 --> 3599.23
donation of 10 cents in a really angry

3591.039 --> 3602.3190000000004
message but then again Dan Kinser also

3599.23 --> 3605.589
sent me PayPal donation so thank you dan

3602.319 --> 3611.339
kinder I just found out thank you very

3605.589 --> 3614.109
much 20 euros Wow

3611.339 --> 3616.15
when that happened the second yesterday

3614.109 --> 3617.5589999999997
so what's probably while it was gaming

3616.15 --> 3623.44
thank you so much thank you sir thank

3617.559 --> 3625.42
you again for your support as for Julie

3623.44 --> 3627.099
Armstrong I don't know I'll probably

3625.42 --> 3631.569
unblock her at some point but I just

3627.099 --> 3634.079
think it was just she was just going too

3631.569 --> 3634.079
far in my opinion

3668.8 --> 3673.77
yeah anyway yeah that's great

3674.1 --> 3680.52
unexpected I was just checking my email

3676.96 --> 3685.36
and then I saw it so happy - happy news

3680.52 --> 3687.42
um let's see what are you guys talking

3685.36 --> 3687.42
about

3691.78 --> 3693.8100000000004
ah

3694.57 --> 3709.02
okay it's that video let me check it out

3698.02 --> 3709.02
ah from Flat Earth [ __ ]

3717.19 --> 3720.27
oh when was that

3723.54 --> 3731.52
well what's that I oh my god I actually

3727.95 --> 3733.91
remember that I didn't know that was

3731.52 --> 3738.3
flatter Fokker that's really cool

3733.91 --> 3741.8399999999997
because I think I saw this this piece of

3738.3 --> 3743.73
stand-up on Owen Benjamin and I think

3741.84 --> 3746.01
there was something said with flat earth

3743.73 --> 3748.55
was that flat earth folk or that is

3746.01 --> 3748.55
really cool

3768.6 --> 3776.69
yeah it's Saturday by the way so I'm not

3771.15 --> 3781.25
in a hurry to end the show any time soon

3776.69 --> 3781.25
would be nice to have a guest on maybe

3793.28 --> 3797.369
[Applause]

3808.77 --> 3817.22
four more hours and I'm not gonna do it

3814.83 --> 3817.22
that long

3823.789 --> 3826.449
No

3830.25 --> 3837.91
especially if it's just me talking I

3832.68 --> 3841.0299999999997
look I'm still I just spent a lot of

3837.91 --> 3844.62
energy yesterday evening and talked and

3841.03 --> 3847.9900000000002
was thinking very actively role playing

3844.62 --> 3852.94
important characters and improvising I

3847.99 --> 3855.87
had to make it feel real so I just a lot

3852.94 --> 3858.64
of energy and you're still getting the

3855.87 --> 3859.48
aftershocks it's like when you put in so

3858.64 --> 3863.6099999999997
much energy

3859.48 --> 3867.52
that's just more becomes tenable becomes

3863.61 --> 3870.9700000000003
it restarts to reach your grasp and now

3867.52 --> 3874.3
I'm just as it is slowly dying down I'm

3870.97 --> 3877.12
still enjoying the details as it were

3874.3 --> 3878.5600000000004
but I needed a bit of a rest after that

3877.12 --> 3881.2799999999997
because I put in a lot of energy

3878.56 --> 3881.2799999999997
yesterday

3893.92 --> 3897.51
at least twice a day

3908.73 --> 3913.259
yeah get some more tea

3919.17 --> 3927.29
[Music]

3935.329 --> 3943.159
morning and evening hmm well the the

3940.249 --> 3952.1299999999997
idea was originally suggested the night

3943.159 --> 3955.609
owl but I'm just in a very different

3952.13 --> 3957.7090000000003
state of mind during the evening and

3955.609 --> 3962.689
especially now that I have a very early

3957.709 --> 3966.1989999999996
rhythm in the evening I'm just I am

3962.689 --> 3967.8799999999997
barely I get kind of tired and they

3966.199 --> 3970.2690000000002
don't pay a lot of attention so I

3967.88 --> 3974.989
wouldn't do any good

3970.269 --> 3978.229
it's also why most of the time at when

3974.989 --> 3980.689
I'm at the debates after a while like

3978.229 --> 3983.509
after the second show has ended I

3980.689 --> 3987.3089999999997
usually just drop because I just get

3983.509 --> 3987.309
knackered I get tired out

3995.24 --> 4004.77
I wonder if there's any ball busters

3997.52 --> 4004.77
this evening did it does anybody know oh

4006.99 --> 4013.2999999999997
by the way talking about Nathan's

4010.45 --> 4020.7599999999998
channel there was a premiere yesterday

4013.3 --> 4024.88
of a a religious debate about again

4020.76 --> 4030.5200000000004
right about Christianity and veganism

4024.88 --> 4032.9500000000003
and I must say that was really

4030.52 --> 4038.44
fascinating debate they listened to it

4032.95 --> 4044.3489999999997
was really good very detailed and pretty

4038.44 --> 4046.27
heavy they went at it it was good so if

4044.349 --> 4051.1600000000003
you haven't seen that go to Nathan

4046.27 --> 4053.109
Oakley's channel and watch the you know

4051.16 --> 4060.93
what I'll just put the link out in chat

4053.109 --> 4060.93
it was it was good let's see

4068.52 --> 4078.18
yeah flatters debate veganism in the

4070.92 --> 4080.4300000000003
Bible so putting it out here as soon as

4078.18 --> 4083.58
my show ends and there's nothing else to

4080.43 --> 4088.64
do go watch it is it was really good

4083.58 --> 4091.29
definitely worth watching if you are

4088.64 --> 4097.88
interested in Christianity and in the

4091.29 --> 4097.88
concept the concept of the laws from God

4104.19 --> 4109.23
yeah Paula made some really good

4106.47 --> 4114.3
arguments it's just it's really good to

4109.23 --> 4117.929999999999
see her when she's in her element she's

4114.3 --> 4120.12
put so much energy into into that Bible

4117.93 --> 4121.91
into understanding it and the seeing the

4120.12 --> 4126.14
connections is it's quite impressive

4121.91 --> 4126.139999999999
when she really gets going at it

4127.01 --> 4135.05
character flaws aside but yeah deep she

4130.95 --> 4138.8099999999995
what she does she does very well hmm

4135.05 --> 4143.070000000001
anyway I think I'm gonna round out the

4138.81 --> 4154.14
show anyway a grantee show is like a

4143.07 --> 4158.37
non-sequitur show nothing new I don't

4154.14 --> 4162.87
know I don't I don't like to compare it

4158.37 --> 4164.67
to that it seems to be rented is a lot

4162.87 --> 4167.43
more open-minded about it it just seems

4164.67 --> 4171.51
to be weirdly siding with groups that I

4167.43 --> 4174.68
wouldn't I wouldn't call it a non

4171.51 --> 4174.68
sequitur to show what he does

4181.96 --> 4186.779
it's another fight show tonight okay

4184.179 --> 4186.779
could be

4189.689 --> 4196.9490000000005
now miss Mason be I'm not a vegan I am a

4193.939 --> 4200.969
partial vegetarian though I do take fish

4196.949 --> 4204.239
oil and I have I would still take bone

4200.969 --> 4206.729
broth from chicken but I'd I'm not doing

4204.239 --> 4215.428999999999
that currently but I I do allow that I

4206.729 --> 4217.7390000000005
just don't eat meat and why I originally

4215.429 --> 4220.619
decided to do that is really for

4217.739 --> 4226.919
metabolic reasons it just seems to work

4220.619 --> 4229.429
better that way I've over my life I've

4226.919 --> 4233.929
just started to grow weary of meat and

4229.429 --> 4237.32
ever since I stopped certain annoying

4233.929 --> 4240.84
skin problems for example have all

4237.32 --> 4246.259999999999
greatly diminished since then compared

4240.84 --> 4248.999
to well the big period before that so

4246.26 --> 4253.9490000000005
and I'm not really missing it at all but

4248.999 --> 4256.32
I still take fish oil maybe that could

4253.949 --> 4258.959
be replaced but I'm not anxious to do

4256.32 --> 4264.09
that anytime soon because it just feels

4258.959 --> 4269.909
really good for me and I am still open

4264.09 --> 4276.059
to animal products I just don't eat meat

4269.909 --> 4278.549999999999
in my diet no not the flesh just no but

4276.059 --> 4282.769
I do still use butter I do still use

4278.55 --> 4286.01
cheese I eat eggs it's just not - meat

4282.769 --> 4286.01
that's it

4287.619 --> 4295.308999999999
and to be fair man during that like a

4293.03 --> 4297.88
week back during when the heat wave was

4295.309 --> 4300.679
there oh yeah people especially when it

4297.88 --> 4303.86
when a good breeze was there and wasn't

4300.679 --> 4307.909
so extremely hot people would go

4303.86 --> 4310.61
barbecue and there would be I would be

4307.909 --> 4315.348999999999
smelling meat everywhere and to be fair

4310.61 --> 4318.949
yes it does make me hungry when I smell

4315.349 --> 4322.039
it but at the same time my stomach is

4318.949 --> 4327.768999999999
saying that's really nice but you've

4322.039 --> 4331.909
already had enough of that so I don't

4327.769 --> 4335.4400000000005
know what but the last time I tried to

4331.909 --> 4340.638999999999
actively eat meat was during Christmas

4335.44 --> 4342.379999999999
and no way it was not even last

4340.639 --> 4346.519
Christmas it was the Christmas before

4342.38 --> 4348.349
that and not mistaken no no it was last

4346.519 --> 4352.369000000001
Christmas right right let's not get it

4348.349 --> 4354.53
wrong and try to eat it and basically

4352.369 --> 4358.389
saying like yeah it's okay to eat meat

4354.53 --> 4363.05
now to my body and my body was like okay

4358.389 --> 4365.150000000001
took basically one swallow of it after

4363.05 --> 4367.099
chewing it really well and I did like

4365.15 --> 4369.11
the sensation of it but then after I

4367.099 --> 4375.469
swallowed it it there was just a block

4369.11 --> 4378.38
it was like just no you had enough like

4375.469 --> 4380.719
that but still there was still a lot

4378.38 --> 4382.9400000000005
there and just couldn't eat it anymore I

4380.719 --> 4386.69
don't know why but it was an intuitive

4382.94 --> 4390.86
block like that was great just don't do

4386.69 --> 4392.449
it I really thought that I was just

4390.86 --> 4397.449
gonna eat the entire thing but I just

4392.449 --> 4401.329
couldn't do it didn't work weird but

4397.449 --> 4405.46
okay it is what it is and I'm fine with

4401.329 --> 4405.46
my current diet very happy about it

4413.0 --> 4417.0
[Applause]

4415.039 --> 4420.2699999999995
huh

4417.0 --> 4424.83
right David Blackson well so do I don't

4420.27 --> 4428.370000000001
I I take questions from the the chat all

4424.83 --> 4431.0599999999995
the time and I get panel members from my

4428.37 --> 4431.0599999999995
chat as well

4443.15 --> 4450.98
all right well musicians for truth

4446.86 --> 4454.79
before I became vegetarian I really

4450.98 --> 4459.5599999999995
really loved organic steak like really

4454.79 --> 4464.9
good quality healthy steak and that was

4459.56 --> 4470.120000000001
just a feast for my senses and I haven't

4464.9 --> 4472.219999999999
actually tried to eat that again but I

4470.12 --> 4475.16
don't know if I'd have the same

4472.22 --> 4479.54
responses with the chicken if my body

4475.16 --> 4482.33
would say like new or that I could

4479.54 --> 4487.61
actually I don't know I don't see any

4482.33 --> 4492.11
need to try it cooked steak why would

4487.61 --> 4499.969999999999
you cook a steak if the you know gotta

4492.11 --> 4505.13
burn it got a singe it anyway yeah let's

4499.97 --> 4509.12
talk about but I look even if I'd remain

4505.13 --> 4512.66
vegetarian I can cook meat or I can make

4509.12 --> 4514.94
good meat if I if I had a guest and they

4512.66 --> 4515.96
eat meat or I wanted to give them

4514.94 --> 4517.849999999999
something special

4515.96 --> 4521.14
I might actually make steak for somebody

4517.85 --> 4523.070000000001
else or for lady friend or something

4521.14 --> 4525.59
even though I'm not gonna eat it myself

4523.07 --> 4531.88
and I can't damn well make a steak trust

4525.59 --> 4531.88
me I had a lot of practice

4545.329 --> 4549.259999999999
mm-hm right yeah there's all kinds of

4547.849 --> 4555.139
way you can do it you can have it almost

4549.26 --> 4557.63
wrong on the inside or you could not

4555.139 --> 4559.6990000000005
have it wrong on the inside but it

4557.63 --> 4561.679
really depends on all the juices and

4559.699 --> 4565.9
everything how you treat it and how you

4561.679 --> 4569.51
heat it it it's a more complicated

4565.9 --> 4573.17
process to do it right then you see then

4569.51 --> 4575.389
I would naturally expect it at first if

4573.17 --> 4577.61
you do it the right way then it doesn't

4575.389 --> 4580.099
have to be read I don't like I never

4577.61 --> 4585.32
liked read made ever never always wanted

4580.099 --> 4589.309
to be properly done but you can get it

4585.32 --> 4593.299999999999
really juicy still and not all chewy if

4589.309 --> 4596.4800000000005
you do it right yeah so let me stop

4593.3 --> 4599.869000000001
talking about preparing a well a well

4596.48 --> 4603.619
made steak that's I'm even getting

4599.869 --> 4606.098999999999
hungry but not for steak though more for

4603.619 --> 4606.098999999999
big eggs

4618.22 --> 4621.22
moose

4622.639 --> 4633.56
I've never tried it I tried reindeer

4628.04 --> 4637.13
once and it was a very weird sensation

4633.56 --> 4639.320000000001
to me but there was just something early

4637.13 --> 4641.33
in that taste that I really didn't like

4639.32 --> 4644.38
just like with sheep or the very

4641.33 --> 4652.82
different taste that I really don't like

4644.38 --> 4655.55
just sheep yak don't like it and wild

4652.82 --> 4657.17
meats even wild boar well I don't I've

4655.55 --> 4660.35
not eaten Pig ever

4657.17 --> 4662.78
I just stopped eating that because there

4660.35 --> 4664.400000000001
were signs of allergy of it in my family

4662.78 --> 4667.13
for my brother side you've responded

4664.4 --> 4669.409
very heavily to it I liked it at first

4667.13 --> 4671.81
but it just didn't feel healthy it's one

4669.409 --> 4679.549999999999
of the first things I quit with I quit

4671.81 --> 4682.7300000000005
eating pork after it all forms after why

4679.55 --> 4690.85
I was I think 20 I just didn't want to

4682.73 --> 4695.119
eat it anymore and I thought hey it's

4690.85 --> 4697.429
kind of convenient too because that way

4695.119 --> 4700.339999999999
I did yeah I'm not annoying any Muslims

4697.429 --> 4705.53
or Jews that was also in in the back of

4700.34 --> 4709.52
my mind at the time for whatever but I

4705.53 --> 4713.63
just I just thought it was sensible to

4709.52 --> 4717.38
not do that to not eat it and besides

4713.63 --> 4722.63
pigs are really smart they're they're

4717.38 --> 4725.33
pigs in my humble opinion are among the

4722.63 --> 4728.36
more intelligent and more conscious very

4725.33 --> 4732.26
conscious and socially conscious land

4728.36 --> 4735.04
dwelling creatures out there maybe even

4732.26 --> 4737.5
in sort of on equal footing to elephants

4735.04 --> 4739.659
pigs are really smart and they are

4737.5 --> 4743.6
strategical they're they're pretty

4739.659 --> 4746.42
hygienic even naturally like they always

4743.6 --> 4748.369000000001
poop in one corner and everything and

4746.42 --> 4751.13
I'd just do that they don't make a mess

4748.369 --> 4753.499
they make a mess if you if you get them

4751.13 --> 4756.889
some mud but yeah that's

4753.499 --> 4758.84
yeah give a pig mud and there is gonna

4756.889 --> 4760.599
be a mess but that's natural and it's

4758.84 --> 4766.9890000000005
actually very healthy for the pig

4760.599 --> 4766.9890000000005
but other than mud no pigs are very tidy

4768.489 --> 4776.36
and there's people also that have pigs

4773.749 --> 4788.03
as pets because you can have a social

4776.36 --> 4791.929
bond with a pig yeah Oh PJ well I've

4788.03 --> 4795.13
once theorized long long ago when I was

4791.929 --> 4798.349
more fluid in my concepts that perhaps

4795.13 --> 4801.05
the pig as we know it may be some

4798.349 --> 4805.159000000001
original crossbreed between humans and

4801.05 --> 4813.13
wild boars in order for them to be able

4805.159 --> 4818.558999999999
to provide organ harvesting capability

4813.13 --> 4822.11
kind of yeah what has been what medical

4818.559 --> 4825.17
medical things have tried even since the

4822.11 --> 4828.61
90s and I think that maybe already pigs

4825.17 --> 4832.1900000000005
were from the Atlantean age the original

4828.61 --> 4836.839999999999
design for living organ breeding

4832.19 --> 4839.36
creatures that that was one of my ideas

4836.84 --> 4843.349
could be that that is what did that type

4839.36 --> 4847.219
of pig is though I've also heard but I

4843.349 --> 4849.7390000000005
can absolutely say that you have had a

4847.219 --> 4851.479
full spectrum confirmation of this also

4849.739 --> 4855.079
heard that if you just leave wild pigs

4851.479 --> 4857.829000000001
to breed on their own that eventually

4855.079 --> 4862.13
they'd kind of revert back to the old

4857.829 --> 4864.139
boar form that they adapt back I don't

4862.13 --> 4871.3
know if that is absolutely true but

4864.139 --> 4874.519
that's what I've heard so I'm not sure

4871.3 --> 4880.76
but yeah big pigs especially when

4874.519 --> 4883.91
they're adult they have or unusually big

4880.76 --> 4888.17
bellies they are like living

4883.91 --> 4891.86
tanks tanks for organs so their design

4888.17 --> 4895.12
just seems to be unusually adapted to

4891.86 --> 4897.92
function as an organ carrying device

4895.12 --> 4907.5199999999995
that that's just how they seem to me

4897.92 --> 4910.01
when they're really big but yeah it's

4907.52 --> 4911.84
it's just a concept I'm not claiming

4910.01 --> 4915.89
that that there is that that is

4911.84 --> 4917.75
definitely true I would know any genetic

4915.89 --> 4920.740000000001
relations that could even point that out

4917.75 --> 4926.06
or may it just may turn out to just

4920.74 --> 4928.94
absolutely not be true and and the way

4926.06 --> 4931.67
they are is just an incidental or maybe

4928.94 --> 4934.19
they have been bred specifically to just

4931.67 --> 4936.25
have more meat around that waist maybe

4934.19 --> 4941.179999999999
that's the reason why they've been

4936.25 --> 4953.44
turning out like they are what I read

4941.18 --> 4953.4400000000005
like that I don't know hey Jay dreamers

4960.52 --> 4966.31
plus my apocalypse really how has that

4963.43 --> 4977.1
gonna happen and then pigs will fly

4966.31 --> 4979.39
right well if there'd be a super heavy

4977.1 --> 4982.09
depolarization or switch around of the

4979.39 --> 4985.030000000001
elective resumed electrostatic field

4982.09 --> 4987.610000000001
that is pre supposedly causing the

4985.03 --> 4989.889999999999
presuppose of gravity then yeah sure

4987.61 --> 4992.17
things may definitely go flying around

4989.89 --> 4993.55
including pigs but I think that pretty

4992.17 --> 4996.76
much everything would be flying around

4993.55 --> 5000.87
if that were the case on the other hands

4996.76 --> 5002.7
on the other hand there may just be a

5000.87 --> 5009.47
couple of silly elites that are gonna

5002.7 --> 5013.86
try to poke everyone by creating setups

5009.47 --> 5020.37
by which they can somatically levitate

5013.86 --> 5029.219999999999
pigs they can do it to frogs so why not

5020.37 --> 5033.18
do it to pigs then you got your flying

5029.22 --> 5035.93
pigs right there the technology to do it

5033.18 --> 5035.93
is already here

5069.04 --> 5079.21
hmm pigs eat people all right I guess

5074.8 --> 5081.89
yeah they can they can eat anything

5079.21 --> 5085.699
they're natural garbage disposal

5081.89 --> 5089.92
creatures that's also probably hell that

5085.699 --> 5089.919999999999
has probably also been a function

5097.07 --> 5103.79
are they immune to snake venom really

5100.43 --> 5110.570000000001
I've never heard of that that's funny

5103.79 --> 5110.57
if it's true right

5112.989 --> 5119.8099999999995
geoffery bill I doubt it I don't think

5117.29 --> 5120.5
that chimpanzees eat meat from big

5119.81 --> 5124.31
creatures

5120.5 --> 5128.75
I think chimpanzees would eat things

5124.31 --> 5132.4400000000005
like small creatures or insects that but

5128.75 --> 5137.38
I don't think they don't tear apart big

5132.44 --> 5137.379999999999
animal corpses they don't they're not

5138.19 --> 5145.2699999999995
like they don't eat dead meat as far as

5141.71 --> 5145.27
I know not chimpanzees

5166.42 --> 5170.68
no peach a No

5179.699 --> 5187.049999999999
now that's absolutely not what evolution

5182.429 --> 5190.89
means but yes there is a giant genetic

5187.05 --> 5195.21
pool a design from which life has been

5190.89 --> 5199.110000000001
built that we think we'd get up to a

5195.21 --> 5200.82
certain level but as we presume certain

5199.11 --> 5202.5
things we then proceed to figure out

5200.82 --> 5205.62
that it wasn't much like that and is

5202.5 --> 5210.21
different and we figure out we're at the

5205.62 --> 5214.7699999999995
precipice with vast unimaginably vast

5210.21 --> 5217.11
region of complexities and there may

5214.77 --> 5222.51
just even be more that we can't even see

5217.11 --> 5229.29
yet at this stage about it that we find

5222.51 --> 5233.34
out afterwards and it has nothing to do

5229.29 --> 5235.05
with evolution that the genetic function

5233.34 --> 5238.110000000001
and how it seems to be working what we

5235.05 --> 5240.84
figure out about it proves more and more

5238.11 --> 5244.11
and more naturally scientifically that

5240.84 --> 5246.2300000000005
evolution is absolute [ __ ] that it

5244.11 --> 5250.86
doesn't work like that at all

5246.23 --> 5253.589999999999
that things can adapt but that entropy

5250.86 --> 5257.04
is also a part that genetic integrity

5253.59 --> 5260.03
and functionality degrades over time it

5257.04 --> 5260.03
doesn't improve

5276.629 --> 5283.369
right adaptation is not a change of

5278.999 --> 5287.699
kinds because what defines adaptation is

5283.369 --> 5292.289
that it can also be adapted back it's a

5287.699 --> 5297.8589999999995
switch within one system it's the same

5292.289 --> 5297.8589999999995
thing it's just in another mode

5313.1 --> 5317.35
what kind of thing is that to say Cleary

5319.679 --> 5323.87
it sad to hear your sisters on crack

5352.729 --> 5356.8
Dredd where's Dredd

5375.9 --> 5384.25
right yeah chants go all over the place

5379.42 --> 5388.719
kind of hard to tie into that nah Oh

5384.25 --> 5394.77
going for 1/2 hours oh you are

5388.719 --> 5394.77
oh I didn't know that

5399.53 --> 5402.49
come on

5420.22 --> 5426.7
all right ah you got dreadlocks I see

5424.42 --> 5430.66
now you're not the other dread I thought

5426.7 --> 5435.07
you were the other dread guy who used to

5430.66 --> 5437.58
run Flat Earth hangouts as well but you

5435.07 --> 5437.58
are not him

5451.02 --> 5459.81
right yep indeed Jeffrey bill but yeah I

5455.76 --> 5462.81
was really impressed by that debate that

5459.81 --> 5465.990000000001
premier so I also brought it up and yeah

5462.81 --> 5469.22
good subject to talk gotta go be right

5465.99 --> 5469.219999999999
back in two minutes

5563.5 --> 5566.5
back

5572.67 --> 5575.909
[Music]

5592.3 --> 5602.89
ah J dreamers that's from the Monty

5594.88 --> 5609.37
Python I recognized that anytime and the

5602.89 --> 5615.25
second one is from a song Hey

5609.37 --> 5616.8
call it I've watched that [ __ ] so many

5615.25 --> 5619.8
times

5616.8 --> 5619.8
unbelievable

5630.22 --> 5636.320000000001
and then he starts to first it's just a

5634.46 --> 5638.72
proud song about how he's a lumberjack

5636.32 --> 5642.5599999999995
and how he's oh really cool and then he

5638.72 --> 5644.18
starts to change his tune and start

5642.56 --> 5648.17
about how he actually likes to wear

5644.18 --> 5653.0
women's clothing like his old papa and

5648.17 --> 5656.08
yeah that's the that's the whole joke it

5653.0 --> 5656.08
was really funny at the time

5665.719 --> 5672.68
right yeah that's true yeah that's true

5668.75 --> 5677.87
GA teaming them and how much time has

5672.68 --> 5687.38
passed since then yeah we were the first

5677.87 --> 5689.33
I was the first to interview you and I

5687.38 --> 5692.62
think you were like my second video the

5689.33 --> 5698.15
first one was with Martin Martin lidka

5692.62 --> 5703.21
no wait it was the third one wasn't

5698.15 --> 5703.21
second let me check my history

5714.4 --> 5719.04
all right let's see how can i order

5723.349 --> 5734.429
yeah yeah you word the second one that's

5729.869 --> 5738.0
right the first one was where are we

5734.429 --> 5740.7300000000005
where I put out all my all my concepts

5738.0 --> 5748.619
for how the world could be that one was

5740.73 --> 5752.669999999999
really good though we were still

5748.619 --> 5755.839999999999
experimental with all the thought of the

5752.67 --> 5755.84
platforms and everything

5774.64 --> 5782.6
can it play a bit of the interview I

5780.4 --> 5788.2699999999995
don't know I think that would be really

5782.6 --> 5797.27
awkward I think I could well if I do

5788.27 --> 5799.820000000001
that I should watch it back myself but

5797.27 --> 5804.76
we were still like at least I remember

5799.82 --> 5804.759999999999
myself being really insecure still and

5804.79 --> 5811.88
it's nothing like like now we're so yeah

5808.84 --> 5814.58
J dreamers as well but myself especially

5811.88 --> 5816.97
I think were just so used to now just

5814.58 --> 5819.95
public talking and explaining things and

5816.97 --> 5822.62
having a debate about things or

5819.95 --> 5825.7699999999995
expressing opinions I'm really used to

5822.62 --> 5830.42
it by now back then I was just so

5825.77 --> 5834.59
nervous about things and would rather

5830.42 --> 5835.57
become blocked rather than finding a way

5834.59 --> 5840.14
out

5835.57 --> 5844.13
what was really cool and also I think

5840.14 --> 5846.83
yeah a dream is was the first one I in

5844.13 --> 5849.2
public basically told like hey I

5846.83 --> 5852.1
remember you from my visions very

5849.2 --> 5857.96
clearly and I still do it's so funny I

5852.1 --> 5860.42
remember him like eating that in that

5857.96 --> 5862.85
giant fishing trip going from thing to

5860.42 --> 5867.85
thing and I remember just watching him

5862.85 --> 5867.85
on the screen doing his thing

5880.129 --> 5890.8
why it's on record on my second or my

5885.889 --> 5890.8
second hangout it's there it's just that

5894.039 --> 5901.969
look to me my visions are just too

5897.469 --> 5909.889
fascinating not to talk about that's

5901.969 --> 5912.499
just me hey Luna ie now today's topic

5909.889 --> 5915.559
it's everything and nothing it's all

5912.499 --> 5918.679
over the place currently having Jay

5915.559 --> 5921.01
dreamers in chat so it's nice to have

5918.679 --> 5921.01
him around

5963.59 --> 5970.71
sorry dank no that's just me I'm just

5967.19 --> 5974.4
staring at the chat motionless it's not

5970.71 --> 5976.429
actually a buffering thing sorry about

5974.4 --> 5976.429
that

5980.269 --> 5986.400000000001
yeah peanuts Clark no no I will not

5983.909 --> 5989.339999999999
apologize for somebody behaving like a

5986.4 --> 5992.369
total [ __ ] for no damn reason other

5989.34 --> 5995.719
than their own political gain I'm not

5992.369 --> 5995.719
gonna apologize for that at all

6004.39 --> 6010.42
you know originally I kind of intended

6006.91 --> 6013.72
to do that but then he came in my chat

6010.42 --> 6016.72
and said really disgusting personal

6013.72 --> 6020.02
attack things and that's just too far

6016.72 --> 6022.09
and when you cross that line when you

6020.02 --> 6028.0
know you're doing it and you're doing it

6022.09 --> 6031.39
that's just one step too far and I'm

6028.0 --> 6034.26
done with it no apology it's it's not

6031.39 --> 6038.740000000001
about being the bigger man it's about

6034.26 --> 6042.64
defending myself and not letting

6038.74 --> 6045.13
nostalgia take me down a path that I

6042.64 --> 6047.1900000000005
shouldn't be going it's as simple as

6045.13 --> 6047.1900000000005
that

6049.53 --> 6056.7699999999995
Jai dreamers look I don't know about the

6053.11 --> 6059.5
Elven race like that I have my own

6056.77 --> 6062.14
associations with the concept but I

6059.5 --> 6064.03
think that I don't know if there's any

6062.14 --> 6069.1900000000005
pure elf still out there they may be

6064.03 --> 6073.63
beyond any potential beyond the known

6069.19 --> 6076.36
realm that we know maybe but I think

6073.63 --> 6078.37
that any elves that are still on this

6076.36 --> 6081.03
continent they've all been mixed in and

6078.37 --> 6083.95
who knows maybe I do have this weird

6081.03 --> 6086.17
genetic trait that could be associated

6083.95 --> 6091.57
with that somewhere hidden within the

6086.17 --> 6096.61
mishmash of Asian and European genetics

6091.57 --> 6099.759999999999
I don't know but I will they return well

6096.61 --> 6102.94
you got it first ensure that there is

6099.76 --> 6105.820000000001
any place outside our known realm first

6102.94 --> 6110.469999999999
in order for something to return from

6105.82 --> 6112.69
there so who knows look what could

6110.47 --> 6117.43
potentially be out there it could be so

6112.69 --> 6120.82
vast that it'll just choke you if it was

6117.43 --> 6123.6
all laid out what was out there like it

6120.82 --> 6128.7699999999995
could be the message like all right so

6123.6 --> 6132.01
remember that the the space cosmology

6128.77 --> 6135.040000000001
story about the giant Federation of

6132.01 --> 6137.429
Planets bla bla bla and all we're just

6135.04 --> 6140.19
one little guy getting and

6137.429 --> 6142.7390000000005
into the vast system well maybe it's

6140.19 --> 6146.28
actually like that except it's not

6142.739 --> 6149.03
freakin planets it's just a giant strip

6146.28 --> 6152.55
of different realms and we may be among

6149.03 --> 6155.58
hundreds who knows how many realms and

6152.55 --> 6157.88
they do have contact and an alliance and

6155.58 --> 6160.65
we're just that little link in there

6157.88 --> 6163.29
that is being kept separate and being

6160.65 --> 6167.9
subjected to the globe concept to

6163.29 --> 6174.42
isolate us who knows the options are

6167.9 --> 6177.0599999999995
vast until we actually come bump into

6174.42 --> 6180.2390000000005
the edge of that dome where it is

6177.06 --> 6182.46
supposedly would be bordering the earth

6180.239 --> 6186.78
where it would be resting on the earth

6182.46 --> 6189.75
and until we don't bump into that

6186.78 --> 6196.44
suppose a dome it could technically go

6189.75 --> 6199.02
on incredible stretches and maybe

6196.44 --> 6199.678999999999
eventually end up looping back where we

6199.02 --> 6202.59
started

6199.679 --> 6204.51
in the north-south directions I don't

6202.59 --> 6207.659000000001
know all kinds of things could be

6204.51 --> 6211.52
possible until we don't bump into the

6207.659 --> 6216.199
dome and have a parameter for our realm

6211.52 --> 6216.1990000000005
for which we cannot go further beyond

6229.75 --> 6238.07
jealousy

6232.65 --> 6245.7
well look the way I just presented it

6238.07 --> 6248.849999999999
isn't that what what the the reversed

6245.7 --> 6252.9
reality people the programmers have been

6248.85 --> 6257.3
doing with every conceivable thing just

6252.9 --> 6260.25
invent fantastical scenarios with setups

6257.3 --> 6263.66
that could potentially be grounded in

6260.25 --> 6268.17
real things out there but it's just

6263.66 --> 6270.15
presented imagine to be huge distances

6268.17 --> 6275.16
on other planets that are physically

6270.15 --> 6278.429999999999
separated just as the cultural idea to

6275.16 --> 6279.93
imprison us and they could be out there

6278.43 --> 6282.51
there could be other realms out there

6279.93 --> 6284.34
that are very advanced very conscious or

6282.51 --> 6286.4400000000005
could have their own personal issues

6284.34 --> 6288.53
maybe there's like this realm where

6286.44 --> 6292.2
everybody's a freaking genius but

6288.53 --> 6294.87
they're all so artistic that they that

6292.2 --> 6298.8
they're having very big difficulties

6294.87 --> 6300.69
with maintaining their logos for example

6298.8 --> 6303.33
who knows science fictional

6300.69 --> 6306.719999999999
possibilities it's like the whole idea

6303.33 --> 6309.71
of Star Trek going from planet to planet

6306.72 --> 6314.22
new races new that well that could

6309.71 --> 6316.68
literally have happened except trance

6314.22 --> 6318.27
ramyon just go from one realm to another

6316.68 --> 6320.9400000000005
you meet these people they're totally

6318.27 --> 6323.700000000001
different the f culture issues okay deal

6320.94 --> 6325.98
with them move on next realm that could

6323.7 --> 6331.07
be their like they could have already

6325.98 --> 6331.07
done that who knows

6334.82 --> 6338.96
yeah just bringing our possibilities

6344.06 --> 6350.150000000001
there now nothing can do that

6361.199 --> 6370.23
no I don't believe in a physical reset

6363.69 --> 6373.099999999999
there is no more physical reset not as

6370.23 --> 6373.099999999999
long as we're here

6381.11 --> 6387.558999999999
I think there probably be weird societal

6384.26 --> 6394.570000000001
mind resets maybe rearrangement of

6387.559 --> 6398.27
society that type of reset but no total

6394.57 --> 6402.079
apocalyptic overhaul yes not for a long

6398.27 --> 6404.360000000001
time to come if ever but let's just

6402.079 --> 6408.92
assume it will then it's gonna take a

6404.36 --> 6413.36
long time and I think when the time

6408.92 --> 6416.719
comes it's not a matter of oh god is it

6413.36 --> 6421.009999999999
coming is it coming no everyone will

6416.719 --> 6423.469
know it will arrive the true and I mean

6421.01 --> 6426.26
not any Jesus return or whatever but

6423.469 --> 6430.61
like the the finally everybody will know

6426.26 --> 6432.889
it's so clearly that it is you couldn't

6430.61 --> 6435.409
even doubt it anymore

6432.889 --> 6437.809
that it would be the case so when the

6435.409 --> 6440.348999999999
absolute end of the physical realm comes

6437.809 --> 6443.4800000000005
everybody will know it there will be

6440.349 --> 6448.01
absolutely no doubt no matter how stupid

6443.48 --> 6449.98
or delusional you are so and that time

6448.01 --> 6453.13
is definitely not here

6449.98 --> 6453.129999999999
definitely not

6461.299 --> 6465.839
well that's up to you

6463.829 --> 6470.629
you don't even know what the rules are

6465.839 --> 6470.629
for the reset

6473.81 --> 6480.820000000001
you don't even know exactly what it is I

6476.42 --> 6485.06
have my ideas about it because I've had

6480.82 --> 6487.549999999999
weird dark world experiences with that

6485.06 --> 6489.860000000001
concept and suggestions and I've even

6487.55 --> 6496.72
said I have a weird feeling like they

6489.86 --> 6501.28
did that in 2012 and have weird

6496.72 --> 6507.2300000000005
correlating vision memories with that

6501.28 --> 6511.88
but I don't know if that's gonna happen

6507.23 --> 6515.0
anytime soon and also who will be doing

6511.88 --> 6518.38
it can they do it I don't think that

6515.0 --> 6521.27
resets are just like cheat codes where

6518.38 --> 6521.99
opponents are just removed it doesn't

6521.27 --> 6525.56
work like that

6521.99 --> 6531.11
it's more complicated more spiritually

6525.56 --> 6534.620000000001
oriented you can't just erase all your

6531.11 --> 6538.07
enemies and just think there is no

6534.62 --> 6540.2
consequences no because that would lead

6538.07 --> 6543.62
to the very quick absolute destruction

6540.2 --> 6546.32
of all life that can't where it cannot

6543.62 --> 6548.51
work like that that just can't

6546.32 --> 6552.74
I don't think resets worked like that I

6548.51 --> 6557.360000000001
think there is like maneuvering that

6552.74 --> 6559.67
maybe people's life experience what

6557.36 --> 6561.7699999999995
drives them could potentially be altered

6559.67 --> 6566.09
for example like people's spirits are

6561.77 --> 6573.56
just switched into another direction

6566.09 --> 6577.31
that could potentially happen but there

6573.56 --> 6579.080000000001
is no oh.look knew this issues going on

6577.31 --> 6582.77
and it's not going anywhere in an OP

6579.08 --> 6585.53
reset yeah we're just gonna erase that

6582.77 --> 6589.280000000001
entire side and every reflection it had

6585.53 --> 6595.73
on it really really a thing that can

6589.28 --> 6598.389999999999
work no way that can work no way not

6595.73 --> 6602.12
without just devastating and especially

6598.39 --> 6606.320000000001
revealing consequences and I don't think

6602.12 --> 6607.5689999999995
they can afford a giant revelation of

6606.32 --> 6610.808999999999
all their control

6607.569 --> 6617.569
for something as short-sighted as

6610.809 --> 6620.169
erasing your opponents no no that's not

6617.569 --> 6620.169000000001
how it's going to work

6628.58 --> 6632.44
there is no time reversal

6642.06 --> 6647.370000000001
time is basically only the stick by

6644.55 --> 6658.05
which we can measure entropy within the

6647.37 --> 6662.55
material realm right that sounds really

6658.05 --> 6665.49
weird day dreamers look I have I'm

6662.55 --> 6668.52
pretty damn sure there is a lot of

6665.49 --> 6672.45
entities out there in the dark world on

6668.52 --> 6675.42
in the spiritual realm there's going to

6672.45 --> 6677.76
be vast amounts of weird fantastical

6675.42 --> 6680.55
things that you can bump into there

6677.76 --> 6683.25
however their nature is not going to be

6680.55 --> 6687.14
very diverse when it really comes down

6683.25 --> 6690.3
to it that's also one of my conclusions

6687.14 --> 6693.51
so whatever appearance these entities on

6690.3 --> 6695.1
the other side may have you shouldn't be

6693.51 --> 6698.34
looking at appearances you should be

6695.1 --> 6702.6
looking at the essence at the frequency

6698.34 --> 6704.85
that'll tell you a lot more about how

6702.6 --> 6709.52
you should be interacting with these

6704.85 --> 6713.06
things but everybody will find that out

6709.52 --> 6713.06
one way or the other

6736.8 --> 6743.88
yeah that that's a funny statement there

6741.24 --> 6755.04
Cleary to the bankers we are all our

6743.88 --> 6757.55
winged Benjamins I don't know I don't

6755.04 --> 6757.55
think so

6772.53 --> 6780.63
ah guys sorry I'm getting really really

6775.47 --> 6782.76
hungry here I want my baked eggs so and

6780.63 --> 6784.62
I've almost been going for two hours

6782.76 --> 6786.84
it's been really interesting though it's

6784.62 --> 6789.17
almost a shame especially having J

6786.84 --> 6794.63
dreamers in my Chad who always brings in

6789.17 --> 6798.51
interesting ideas every time he visits

6794.63 --> 6800.49
tends to stir up conversation but I've

6798.51 --> 6803.25
really got to eat something so I am

6800.49 --> 6803.7
gonna round out the show sorry about

6803.25 --> 6806.52
that

6803.7 --> 6809.79
well you got two hours at least so

6806.52 --> 6813.570000000001
thanks everyone for coming and for being

6809.79 --> 6818.87
in chat and just having these elaborate

6813.57 --> 6824.88
conversations about possibilities and

6818.87 --> 6826.83
hmm sorry I don't know if there's gonna

6824.88 --> 6828.78
be a ball busters tonight I will check

6826.83 --> 6830.82
it out if there is and we'll just see

6828.78 --> 6833.94
maybe I'll hang around with Jose's or

6830.82 --> 6835.86
something I don't know I did get on the

6833.94 --> 6838.169999999999
hose days by the way yesterday I think

6835.86 --> 6840.719999999999
if I remember correctly yeah I did

6838.17 --> 6842.91
right before we went to work right

6840.72 --> 6844.860000000001
before my game that was kind of

6842.91 --> 6847.8
interesting I think I did really well

6844.86 --> 6849.389999999999
there so maybe you could check that out

6847.8 --> 6852.03
if you haven't already Jose's from

6849.39 --> 6857.04
yesterday I was on it I think for over

6852.03 --> 6859.349999999999
an hour I was actually active so anyway

6857.04 --> 6860.28
again thanks for coming I will be back

6859.35 --> 6864.21
tomorrow with Flat Earth

6860.28 --> 6865.83
early-bird number 264 oh yeah also by

6864.21 --> 6868.53
the way thanks again for all the super
