99.2 --> 101.84
again

102.079 --> 106.079
just a bit rainy here and there yeah

104.079 --> 107.759
yeah at some point i thought it was

106.079 --> 110.32
gonna snow

107.759 --> 112.479
but then it was just rain coming down so

110.32 --> 114.079
it almost seemed like it was snow but it

112.479 --> 116.56
melted before it hit the ground

114.079 --> 119.439
or something just the way of the

116.56 --> 119.43900000000001
structure of it

119.52 --> 124.56
was like this weird shower of little

122.56 --> 128.31900000000002
droplets

124.56 --> 130.64000000000001
so but no more snow it's not that cold

128.319 --> 130.64
even

135.599 --> 140.48
well at least not compared to two days

138.16 --> 140.48
ago

141.36 --> 144.959
and yeah clouds

146.64 --> 150.55999999999997
going past pretty fast up there

155.599 --> 157.84
all right

167.28 --> 173.68
all right so ah

170.319 --> 174.879
monday morning eh nobody in chat just

173.68 --> 177.68
yet

174.879 --> 179.92
oh well i'll just keep going by myself

177.68 --> 179.92000000000002
then

180.08 --> 185.84
we'll see who comes in

196.84 --> 200.4
right

198.0 --> 201.44
things that happened yesterday robin

200.4 --> 204.159
stanley's first

201.44 --> 204.159
good to see you

204.959 --> 209.92000000000002
yeah i went a bit on netflix yesterday

207.2 --> 214.879
just diving for a movie

209.92 --> 217.11999999999998
found this just yeah kind of random pick

214.879 --> 218.0
but it was turned out to be kind of

217.12 --> 222.08
funny

218.0 --> 225.2
or funny amusing

222.08 --> 226.64000000000001
australian movie i think or at least all

225.2 --> 229.76
the actors were

226.64 --> 234.07999999999998
so i take it it's australian some

229.76 --> 234.07999999999998
actors seem familiar so from

234.319 --> 239.04
from the other that series i watched a

236.879 --> 242.72
while back

239.04 --> 244.56
uh it's a glitch right

242.72 --> 246.64
so i i recognize some of the actors so

244.56 --> 250.0
it's an australian crew a movie called

246.64 --> 252.55999999999997
go-karts was all about cards it was a

250.0 --> 255.68
racing movie but with cards

252.56 --> 257.12
and it yeah it's fun it was fun to watch

255.68 --> 259.44
it was interesting

257.12 --> 261.04
it yeah it wasn't super spectacular but

259.44 --> 261.6
it was a pretty good movie and they had

261.04 --> 265.84000000000003
some

261.6 --> 266.72
really good show don't tell moments in

265.84 --> 268.63899999999995
there

266.72 --> 270.639
like that that even kind of got to me

268.639 --> 272.479
emotionally so

270.639 --> 275.68
it i thought it was a pretty good movie

272.479 --> 275.68
overall and amusing

276.72 --> 287.199
so yeah watch go-karts on netflix

282.72 --> 291.91900000000004
and if you like carts or just racing

287.199 --> 291.91900000000004
it's probably amusing to you as a movie

293.84 --> 300.0
and yeah some movie silliness

297.44 --> 301.44
in there like if you're really technical

300.0 --> 303.84
you'll probably look at it and just

301.44 --> 306.56
think oh yeah sure in a movie right

303.84 --> 307.52
you can do that in the real world

306.56 --> 309.44
slightly less

307.52 --> 311.44
so i didn't notice some of that it was

309.44 --> 312.08
kind of dramatized to make it more into

311.44 --> 314.56
a movie

312.08 --> 316.0
but it was just i thought it was very

314.56 --> 319.199
amusing anyway

316.0 --> 322.0
little rob h ski

319.199 --> 323.84000000000003
and dinner catch up with a friend nice

322.0 --> 327.36
and normal

323.84 --> 331.44
alright that sounds

327.36 --> 332.08000000000004
cool was that what you were doing

331.44 --> 339.52
yesterday

332.08 --> 341.12
robin stanley

339.52 --> 343.52
or is that what you're planning to do

341.12 --> 343.52
today

343.68 --> 348.8
all right that's what you did yesterday

345.28 --> 352.4
not nice skiing

348.8 --> 355.62
yeah got green tea

352.4 --> 355.62
[Music]

357.039 --> 361.919
yeah there were still by the way as i

359.12 --> 365.759
went for groceries yesterday we're still

361.919 --> 368.4
remnants of snowman snowmen

365.759 --> 369.6
everywhere so it's still just slightly

368.4 --> 372.88
melting

369.6 --> 376.96000000000004
balls of of snow

372.88 --> 378.96
so yeah a lot of people went at it

376.96 --> 380.31899999999996
and yeah there was really a lot of snow

378.96 --> 383.12
when it hit

380.319 --> 383.84000000000003
and yeah so it spotted i think at least

383.12 --> 386.88
three

383.84 --> 390.08
maybe four snowmen that

386.88 --> 391.44
yeah of which the last remnants were

390.08 --> 395.68
also melting because

391.44 --> 399.039
yesterday it did melt away pretty quick

395.68 --> 399.039
or yesterday morning

401.84 --> 406.08
and yeah i totally get it because the

403.44 --> 409.84
temperature is warmer like

406.08 --> 411.919
it's still not warm but just

409.84 --> 414.56
completely different because i haven't

411.919 --> 418.24
been really

414.56 --> 420.24
complaining yesterday by how cold it is

418.24 --> 421.36
every time i open the door and i really

420.24 --> 423.36
did feel like that

421.36 --> 425.36
like the week before because it was so

423.36 --> 428.40000000000003
much colder

425.36 --> 432.08000000000004
and now it's it's more mild and i'm

428.4 --> 437.67999999999995
yeah i'm glad of it even though the snow

432.08 --> 440.0
was very beautiful

437.68 --> 440.0
right

445.44 --> 450.479
so yesterday's debates uh i mean

448.72 --> 453.52000000000004
the flat earth early bird show yesterday

450.479 --> 456.15999999999997
was it was really fun

453.52 --> 458.0
seeing nathan and i said blue marble

456.16 --> 462.639
signs go at it

458.0 --> 464.56
in chat like i was amused by that

462.639 --> 467.039
and it's good to be able to verbally

464.56 --> 469.599
address things and then

467.039 --> 470.71999999999997
it's always funny when you notice that

469.599 --> 472.96
people in chat

470.72 --> 475.03900000000004
especially the the baller trolls that

472.96 --> 478.479
they just don't listen

475.039 --> 480.31899999999996
they they don't they just focus on the

478.479 --> 482.15999999999997
chat they don't even listen to what is

480.319 --> 485.03900000000004
being talked about

482.16 --> 488.24
when they do that does anybody else

485.039 --> 488.24
notice that specifically

488.56 --> 492.0
it's not even when for example on the

490.72 --> 495.12
debates somebody

492.0 --> 496.72
gets in a baller and then at some point

495.12 --> 498.24
starts rumpusing and they keep on

496.72 --> 501.12
rambling and they don't listen

498.24 --> 501.44
like nathan tests this but even when

501.12 --> 507.84000000000003
they're

501.44 --> 510.4
in chat they put it on mute

507.84 --> 511.11999999999995
they're in a way so activated or

510.4 --> 513.5989999999999
triggered

511.12 --> 514.9590000000001
by whatever is being said countering

513.599 --> 518.24
whatever they're doing

514.959 --> 520.8
that they're just putting on

518.24 --> 521.919
death they put themselves on death and

520.8 --> 526.56
they just

521.919 --> 526.56
output their trick

527.519 --> 532.24
like i wonder sometimes if they do it

530.08 --> 534.88
just

532.24 --> 535.519
as a last ditch effort and they just put

534.88 --> 537.519
their self

535.519 --> 539.44
themselves on deaf and to just be able

537.519 --> 540.88
to focus to do that to get it out of

539.44 --> 543.839
their system

540.88 --> 544.88
and then on to some virtual victory or

543.839 --> 549.839
move on

544.88 --> 552.32
because they always just want to move on

549.839 --> 553.6
ballers have in their own way become

552.32 --> 557.2
like intellectual

553.6 --> 562.72
nomads they keep moving

557.2 --> 567.0400000000001
they never stand still

562.72 --> 567.0400000000001
what yaddo okay

567.44 --> 577.839
you're going to antarctica all right

571.36 --> 577.839
what are you gonna do there

579.279 --> 584.16
or is this just some more random

581.839 --> 586.48
[ __ ] remark from people in chat

584.16 --> 586.48
board

589.12 --> 592.88
because i'm seeing more of that too

598.08 --> 605.839
intellectual nomads yeah

607.92 --> 619.8389999999999
yeah it's a pretty good description

609.92 --> 619.8389999999999
isn't it

623.21 --> 626.389
[Music]

630.28 --> 636.9499999999999
[Music]

637.36 --> 640.88
yeah it's funny how these words

638.88 --> 644.32
sometimes just come to me they

640.88 --> 646.8
literally just appear out of nowhere

644.32 --> 648.72
in my mind it's like oh yeah this and

646.8 --> 649.1999999999999
that oh you put it together it's that

648.72 --> 653.0400000000001
easy

649.2 --> 658.1600000000001
it's just it just appears in front of me

653.04 --> 661.8389999999999
so yeah it's pretty good title even

658.16 --> 661.8389999999999
for the hangout why not

664.56 --> 670.0
standing on shifting sands

667.76 --> 673.2
yeah now you're even making it into a

670.0 --> 676.079
bit of arab nomad

673.2 --> 677.839
because they typically you know in sans

676.079 --> 678.399
it's funny how that's coming together

677.839 --> 680.6400000000001
like that

678.399 --> 683.2
but yeah intellectual nomads ballers a

680.64 --> 685.8389999999999
lot of them

683.2 --> 688.399
that keep hanging on they become

685.839 --> 692.32
intellectual nomads and they just

688.399 --> 694.16
keep moving on they they try to never

692.32 --> 696.24
stand still in an argument

694.16 --> 698.3199999999999
because as soon as they do they just

696.24 --> 701.6800000000001
sink in deep and then they get caught

698.32 --> 704.0
and then it's over or at least

701.68 --> 704.88
morally or their train of thought is

704.0 --> 706.959
over it doesn't

704.88 --> 708.72
then it stops because it just turns out

706.959 --> 711.1999999999999
it's all

708.72 --> 712.0790000000001
it's all nonsense it's you're just

711.2 --> 714.8000000000001
playing a game

712.079 --> 716.56
it doesn't actually lead to anywhere so

714.8 --> 718.959
if they just keep on moving like

716.56 --> 721.76
intellectual nomads

718.959 --> 723.5999999999999
then they at least then they're

721.76 --> 726.48
traveling and then they have the feeling

723.6 --> 731.839
that they're gonna end up somewhere

726.48 --> 731.839
in relation to what they're doing

732.079 --> 736.3199999999999
so it's all about chasing the sensation

735.279 --> 745.8389999999999
the

736.32 --> 749.2
the dream chasing a dream

745.839 --> 749.2
or a mirage indeed

756.32 --> 773.839
hey that's dutch sailor

760.959 --> 773.8389999999999
welcome to chat

778.29 --> 781.38
[Music]

784.48 --> 790.399
right so that's pretty funny i just came

787.92 --> 790.399
up with that

796.24 --> 803.12
yeah i've also noticed that i should

799.36 --> 803.12
definitely start to make more notes

805.44 --> 809.6
even just interesting keywords so even

807.92 --> 810.7199999999999
though i'm naming the hangout like this

809.6 --> 812.48
i'm writing it down

810.72 --> 813.839
so that i have something when i look

812.48 --> 817.04
onto it

813.839 --> 817.0400000000001
something to remind me

817.839 --> 821.519
should be doing that you'll be using

821.12 --> 824.639
that

821.519 --> 824.639
robin stanley cool

826.48 --> 830.16
yeah we'll see how well it uh

830.639 --> 837.7
it hits this spot out there

834.46 --> 837.7
[Music]

838.0 --> 842.0
but it is a pretty concise and good

840.16 --> 844.8
description it doesn't even have

842.0 --> 845.44
any negative connotations or anything is

844.8 --> 848.74
that

845.44 --> 850.0790000000001
connotation is that the right word

848.74 --> 857.839
[Music]

850.079 --> 857.8389999999999
let me figure that out

862.079 --> 866.7199999999999
right yeah i actually damn i use words

865.36 --> 868.5600000000001
sometimes and then

866.72 --> 869.9200000000001
afterward i'm like is did i use that

868.56 --> 872.16
correctly but yeah

869.92 --> 873.199
apparently my subconscious arranged it

872.16 --> 875.76
properly

873.199 --> 878.16
recognized the word cross-referenced it

875.76 --> 879.199
on an ethereal level properly enough to

878.16 --> 881.199
put it

879.199 --> 883.12
exactly in this right place even though

881.199 --> 887.5999999999999
consciously

883.12 --> 887.6
i have to catch up with it weird

888.32 --> 894.0
it's like my subconscious knows a lot

891.279 --> 895.76
more about language than i do

894.0 --> 899.839
that sounds really silly when you say it

895.76 --> 899.8389999999999
like that but it is what it is

921.04 --> 927.5999999999999
well then language confidence well it's

924.24 --> 931.12
also just

927.6 --> 934.5600000000001
my subconscious just does it

931.12 --> 938.32
and i forget sometimes or well

934.56 --> 941.5999999999999
yeah my consciousness

938.32 --> 945.36
doesn't have to have that wider view

941.6 --> 948.88
on it really but my subconscious

945.36 --> 952.0790000000001
knows so many ways of saying things has

948.88 --> 955.759
listened very carefully to when people

952.079 --> 960.56
use words carefully and just by

955.759 --> 963.279
intuition recognizes like the moment

960.56 --> 965.68
like the essence of things and how to

963.279 --> 968.079
then fit a word in there

965.68 --> 969.92
recognize that process in other people

968.079 --> 973.92
as they speak

969.92 --> 976.959
and figure it out assimilate that

973.92 --> 980.3199999999999
assimilate just the usage of words

976.959 --> 982.4799999999999
when is the right moment for what word

980.32 --> 983.759
and it it goes way beyond my

982.48 --> 986.8000000000001
consciousness

983.759 --> 988.639
keeping track of things way

986.8 --> 989.8389999999999
and it has even in the past and in the

988.639 --> 992.24
past i was so so

989.839 --> 994.0790000000001
surprised because i didn't even know how

992.24 --> 996.24
to look

994.079 --> 1000.0
my consciousness could not even see that

996.24 --> 1000.0
far in order to recognize that

1000.24 --> 1004.24
this is just some subconscious process

1002.639 --> 1007.36
that's happening

1004.24 --> 1008.24
now i can see it because i spent so much

1007.36 --> 1010.5600000000001
of my life

1008.24 --> 1012.399
basically looking at that sort of thing

1010.56 --> 1014.079
and figuring out the mechanics of the

1012.399 --> 1016.16
spirit and

1014.079 --> 1018.56
like where is something coming from in a

1016.16 --> 1018.56
person

1019.44 --> 1025.839
all right but it it helps a lot though

1027.199 --> 1031.199
knowing i have that that ability

1030.319 --> 1033.9189999999999
available

1031.199 --> 1034.559
and that i probably have it in ways

1033.919 --> 1037.76
better than

1034.559 --> 1039.839
other people it does

1037.76 --> 1041.36
inspire a little confidence it does make

1039.839 --> 1043.6
me like yeah well at least i'm

1041.36 --> 1045.039
i'm pretty good at english you know

1043.6 --> 1046.7199999999998
thank god

1045.039 --> 1050.72
thank god i have something that i'm

1046.72 --> 1050.72
actually proud of and good at

1050.84 --> 1056.8799999999999
uh because

1054.559 --> 1060.6399999999999
i usually tend to look at my own life

1056.88 --> 1062.88
with a lot of dissatisfaction

1060.64 --> 1062.88
like

1064.32 --> 1068.24
looking back on it in ways and i know

1066.64 --> 1070.4
there's like good moments and

1068.24 --> 1071.919
there's in the moment a lot of good and

1070.4 --> 1074.0800000000002
i do my best and

1071.919 --> 1076.24
yeah i get that there's always something

1074.08 --> 1077.76
good

1076.24 --> 1080.88
thank god because that's what they

1077.76 --> 1082.64
usually hang on to but still

1080.88 --> 1086.16
man in the face of everything i've

1082.64 --> 1086.16
learned i feel like i'm just

1087.039 --> 1090.48
under utilizing myself and then i

1089.6 --> 1094.24
reflect that

1090.48 --> 1097.44
back on experiences where i did try to

1094.24 --> 1100.32
reach and then why that failed and then

1097.44 --> 1100.3200000000002
i realized that

1101.039 --> 1107.2
i just demand more from myself

1104.88 --> 1108.64
than i can realistically handle and it

1107.2 --> 1111.28
it would be good if i

1108.64 --> 1113.3600000000001
found a more sensible way of viewing

1111.28 --> 1115.44
myself

1113.36 --> 1117.6789999999999
that i could latch onto and anchor

1115.44 --> 1121.1200000000001
myself in so that i would

1117.679 --> 1121.52
be able to engage smoother without so

1121.12 --> 1125.12
much

1121.52 --> 1127.039
nerves just do things that i should be

1125.12 --> 1130.08
doing

1127.039 --> 1132.16
like i need to i really need to just

1130.08 --> 1133.76
figure out how to get some kind of face

1132.16 --> 1136.96
to face social life back i

1133.76 --> 1137.44
really need it back i really need it

1136.96 --> 1139.52
back

1137.44 --> 1142.64
and i'm kind of starting to feel some

1139.52 --> 1145.76
desperation there it sounds bizarre

1142.64 --> 1147.44
but if that doesn't even directly have

1145.76 --> 1148.08
to do with flat earth by the way so

1147.44 --> 1150.16
don't

1148.08 --> 1151.9189999999999
yeah i know ballers are gonna love that

1150.16 --> 1153.3600000000001
sort of [ __ ] when they hear a flat earth

1151.919 --> 1156.64
or say something like that

1153.36 --> 1158.9599999999998
it's not about that it's about me

1156.64 --> 1159.679
yeah it's not just because i was dumb

1158.96 --> 1162.16
enough to

1159.679 --> 1162.72
latch onto flat earth no it was always

1162.16 --> 1166.0800000000002
like this

1162.72 --> 1167.76
i'm always been like a nat like a social

1166.08 --> 1171.36
isolationist

1167.76 --> 1175.039
by by tendency and habit

1171.36 --> 1177.76
and that is the problem

1175.039 --> 1179.52
because yeah i don't need to talk about

1177.76 --> 1181.28
flat earth all the time that's not the

1179.52 --> 1185.76
thing that is making it difficult

1181.28 --> 1185.76
the thing is making it difficult is me

1185.919 --> 1191.44
and not just concerning what people

1189.039 --> 1194.32
think about what the world is and what

1191.44 --> 1197.44
is important but just

1194.32 --> 1199.4399999999998
i see too many mistakes and i've used to

1197.44 --> 1201.44
be bothered by that in the past and then

1199.44 --> 1203.039
thought oh i'm here to correct this

1201.44 --> 1205.039
and then figured out that people just

1203.039 --> 1207.84
thought it was very annoying when you

1205.039 --> 1210.1589999999999
point them at their own flaws even in an

1207.84 --> 1212.32
attempt to help them

1210.159 --> 1213.44
yeah that didn't make me popular so that

1212.32 --> 1218.84
didn't work

1213.44 --> 1222.48
and now i would have to engage and just

1218.84 --> 1224.9599999999998
spectate how people are screwed up

1222.48 --> 1227.2
fooling themselves in very stupid ways

1224.96 --> 1229.919
and then demand that you don't

1227.2 --> 1229.919
tell them

1230.72 --> 1234.96
and they don't even know it it's just

1232.4 --> 1235.76
that everybody conducts themselves in

1234.96 --> 1239.2
that way or

1235.76 --> 1240.0
a lot not all the time it's like a

1239.2 --> 1244.799
moment

1240.0 --> 1248.559
and a time to get introspective maybe

1244.799 --> 1250.6399999999999
for some people i hope for them i do see

1248.559 --> 1252.72
people have some introspective

1250.64 --> 1255.3600000000001
conversations sometimes

1252.72 --> 1258.64
but it's rare i do it all the time like

1255.36 --> 1260.84
literally all the time

1258.64 --> 1263.679
hello roger by the way good to see you

1260.84 --> 1267.1999999999998
again

1263.679 --> 1270.72
but yeah the majority of people

1267.2 --> 1273.2
just they just

1270.72 --> 1277.2
let it all manifest as it is and just

1273.2 --> 1279.52
try to hop around with what they have

1277.2 --> 1279.52
and

1285.76 --> 1291.84
i think that people have arranged their

1288.48 --> 1296.48
social behavior in ways that just

1291.84 --> 1296.48
are in relation to how other people have

1297.2 --> 1302.32
how other people conduct themselves and

1300.32 --> 1302.8799999999999
that's how they form themselves but it

1302.32 --> 1306.96
is

1302.88 --> 1306.96
has become i think

1307.44 --> 1310.799
just very erratic

1311.039 --> 1314.32
like there's this thing happened where

1313.76 --> 1316.24
because

1314.32 --> 1318.48
so many people go in all kinds of

1316.24 --> 1319.28
directions with what they do and try to

1318.48 --> 1322.64
normalize

1319.28 --> 1325.76
everything that has become much more

1322.64 --> 1327.2
a wild ranger pick and people pick up

1325.76 --> 1330.4
traits

1327.2 --> 1332.72
that just make it to me

1330.4 --> 1334.48
from the old days i don't know if that

1332.72 --> 1337.76
even means anything

1334.48 --> 1339.52
it probably was bad back then as well i

1337.76 --> 1341.84
had so much trouble with people when i

1339.52 --> 1345.36
was younger so much and they

1341.84 --> 1348.8799999999999
like bad attitudes and bad responses

1345.36 --> 1350.8799999999999
all over the place i like every time

1348.88 --> 1354.0800000000002
i would meet somebody that actually

1350.88 --> 1357.679
pointed me at bad behavior

1354.08 --> 1357.6789999999999
a lot of them just couldn't even

1357.76 --> 1361.36
carry the proper authority to point it

1359.919 --> 1363.2
out to me

1361.36 --> 1366.1589999999999
like they didn't have the confidence to

1363.2 --> 1369.8400000000001
actually tell me

1366.159 --> 1372.159
like how how i was being stubborn and

1369.84 --> 1375.84
foolish

1372.159 --> 1376.5590000000002
so i didn't care way back now i'm

1375.84 --> 1379.84
talking about

1376.559 --> 1382.32
it like stupid teenage days

1379.84 --> 1382.32
mostly

1386.84 --> 1392.08
huh

1389.52 --> 1393.6
but anyway it's a challenge but i have

1392.08 --> 1396.48
to do it i have to

1393.6 --> 1397.039
learn how to deal with it my dad can do

1396.48 --> 1398.559
it

1397.039 --> 1400.559
and i feel like okay my dad's a

1398.559 --> 1402.32
completely different person in many ways

1400.559 --> 1404.6399999999999
how he conducts himself how he's learned

1402.32 --> 1406.72
to conduct himself he has different

1404.64 --> 1407.679
peak talents that are in a very

1406.72 --> 1410.72
different spot

1407.679 --> 1414.72
as i have mine but i feel like i

1410.72 --> 1414.72
need to be able to do that somehow

1415.28 --> 1418.3999999999999
and then i'm just going to be more

1416.72 --> 1421.279
clunky i guess more

1418.4 --> 1423.1200000000001
foolish more feeling like an idiot i

1421.279 --> 1423.76
guess that's just the way it's going to

1423.12 --> 1426.9599999999998
have to be

1423.76 --> 1427.36
i have no other choice because i can't

1426.96 --> 1430.559
just

1427.36 --> 1433.76
keep continuing

1430.559 --> 1433.76
isolating myself

1434.32 --> 1438.48
like this it's unhealthy

1439.76 --> 1442.96
and i don't want to fill it up with like

1442.32 --> 1445.4399999999998
oh

1442.96 --> 1446.4
i need help with it so i'm going to seek

1445.44 --> 1449.1200000000001
out specific

1446.4 --> 1452.96
help to not be lonely or something then

1449.12 --> 1452.9599999999998
then it really becomes a problem

1453.52 --> 1458.24
i can't just start branding it as some

1455.52 --> 1461.36
kind of like disorder

1458.24 --> 1462.159
because it's not a disorder well maybe

1461.36 --> 1465.1999999999998
it is it's

1462.159 --> 1467.0390000000002
it's it is disorder it's just not a

1465.2 --> 1469.279
psychological disorder it's like the

1467.039 --> 1471.36
natural consequence of the entire

1469.279 --> 1474.48
manifestation of who i am and

1471.36 --> 1476.32
in their relation to the world it was

1474.48 --> 1478.64
always going to be like that

1476.32 --> 1480.32
you can't alter that it's part of just

1478.64 --> 1483.6000000000001
the

1480.32 --> 1486.799
character signature my manifestation of

1483.6 --> 1486.799
my arrival in this world

1488.799 --> 1492.1589999999999
and yeah that difference also is kind of

1491.44 --> 1495.2
feeding me

1492.159 --> 1496.24
in making me feel like okay yes am i

1495.2 --> 1499.6000000000001
really human

1496.24 --> 1501.919
when everybody is acting so differently

1499.6 --> 1504.9599999999998
in many ways and nobody seems to care in

1501.919 --> 1504.96
so many ways and

1508.64 --> 1516.64
feel so far removed from how i do things

1512.96 --> 1517.6000000000001
relation to other people and then other

1516.64 --> 1520.24
people might see

1517.6 --> 1520.6399999999999
those traits of minors like oh that

1520.24 --> 1523.36
means

1520.64 --> 1524.3200000000002
i am i guess slightly autistic or

1523.36 --> 1527.1999999999998
something

1524.32 --> 1528.96
so you get all these like reasons why i

1527.2 --> 1531.1200000000001
am so different that's what people just

1528.96 --> 1535.3600000000001
start to try to figure out

1531.12 --> 1538.8799999999999
i think and i tried that too

1535.36 --> 1542.08
but i don't know do i really

1538.88 --> 1545.5200000000002
fit anywhere on these prefabricated

1542.08 --> 1548.72
interpretations i would

1545.52 --> 1551.84
actually like to hear some some of your

1548.72 --> 1554.0
attempts or judgments of like what are

1551.84 --> 1554.0
the

1554.24 --> 1560.96
the the typical traits that make me

1557.52 --> 1564.559
me for you see

1560.96 --> 1566.48
like what about me makes me specifically

1564.559 --> 1569.9189999999999
arwen and not just

1566.48 --> 1570.48
like the rest i would like to know i'm

1569.919 --> 1573.6000000000001
asking

1570.48 --> 1576.32
i'm asking right now and hey even

1573.6 --> 1578.9599999999998
even some trolls may have some input if

1576.32 --> 1578.96
they insist

1579.2 --> 1583.039
you know how i respond to everything and

1581.76 --> 1586.559
just because somebody

1583.039 --> 1587.36
intends something that reflects upon

1586.559 --> 1591.44
their ego

1587.36 --> 1593.9189999999999
more than on some honest judgment

1591.44 --> 1596.159
i will still get the essence of it

1593.919 --> 1598.5590000000002
because it all starts with

1596.159 --> 1599.7600000000002
one spirit responding to another spirit

1598.559 --> 1603.6
and however it

1599.76 --> 1605.919
then manifests its response the original

1603.6 --> 1607.4399999999998
engagement is there i can still make it

1605.919 --> 1609.5200000000002
out

1607.44 --> 1612.0800000000002
it's like it doesn't matter like that if

1609.52 --> 1613.9189999999999
you attack me in your communication

1612.08 --> 1616.559
or if you're just being nice in your

1613.919 --> 1618.5590000000002
communication i can feel the original

1616.559 --> 1626.45
spark that set it out

1618.559 --> 1628.24
and i'm reading it

1626.45 --> 1633.2
[Music]

1628.24 --> 1636.96
you never made any friend no now i have

1633.2 --> 1637.919
from the netherlands well i in a way i

1636.96 --> 1639.919
have

1637.919 --> 1642.0
but it's not the same it's more like

1639.919 --> 1644.0800000000002
friendly acquaintances and

1642.0 --> 1645.36
yeah people that you can kind of like

1644.08 --> 1650.32
trust

1645.36 --> 1653.12
for the future it's it's just that

1650.32 --> 1655.279
oh for for example i kill the hope i've

1653.12 --> 1656.2399999999998
met him a couple of times he's a really

1655.279 --> 1660.32
awesome guy

1656.24 --> 1664.0
really awesome and

1660.32 --> 1665.6
like he has great skills he has some

1664.0 --> 1669.52
really good wisdom

1665.6 --> 1672.32
and just a lot of love that's very

1669.52 --> 1672.32
very strong

1673.2 --> 1676.24
i appreciate that

1677.679 --> 1683.3600000000001
also made me realize like i do have

1680.799 --> 1686.559
strong love it's like when it happens it

1683.36 --> 1688.9599999999998
happens strong i don't hold back

1686.559 --> 1690.48
and he has that too a little so i have

1688.96 --> 1693.279
met some really cool

1690.48 --> 1697.679
dutch people and hey uh roger is pretty

1693.279 --> 1700.799
cool now i haven't met him face to face

1697.679 --> 1702.64
but yeah

1700.799 --> 1704.72
so that's really the issue it's like

1702.64 --> 1706.24
face to face is there anything left for

1704.72 --> 1710.08
me doing face to face or

1706.24 --> 1712.72
have i actually accidentally become

1710.08 --> 1714.799
one of these puppets out there that

1712.72 --> 1716.0
constantly walk around all day looking

1714.799 --> 1718.32
in their screen except

1716.0 --> 1720.24
i don't have a mobile looking in my

1718.32 --> 1721.6
stream i just sit behind my freaking

1720.24 --> 1725.84
computer all day long

1721.6 --> 1725.84
am i really that different

1726.159 --> 1729.279
or have i actually fallen in the trap

1728.799 --> 1731.36
that i

1729.279 --> 1733.6
saw coming even tried to warn some

1731.36 --> 1739.84
people about in the early stages but i'm

1733.6 --> 1739.84
actually right there in the trap

1751.919 --> 1757.44
can you you can say you are norm

1755.12 --> 1757.4399999999998
am i

1764.08 --> 1769.6789999999999
now what is normal even like that

1767.52 --> 1770.72
that description is just like how i feel

1769.679 --> 1774.0800000000002
about it like

1770.72 --> 1776.1200000000001
i don't feel normal

1774.08 --> 1777.6789999999999
but then yeah philosophically and

1776.12 --> 1781.039
cross-referencing

1777.679 --> 1782.72
who is what is normal you know you can

1781.039 --> 1784.799
approach normal and all kinds of things

1782.72 --> 1786.64
like what is normal in an esoteric sense

1784.799 --> 1791.279
to a spirit to a person

1786.64 --> 1794.5590000000002
well normal can be boring normal can be

1791.279 --> 1798.72
morally correct

1794.559 --> 1800.8799999999999
normal can be being super efficient and

1798.72 --> 1803.2
going with the times

1800.88 --> 1804.5590000000002
see normal can be all these different

1803.2 --> 1807.279
things to people

1804.559 --> 1808.24
it's where do they lay their focus and

1807.279 --> 1811.36
that also

1808.24 --> 1814.3990000000001
makes their normal

1811.36 --> 1815.12
so in a way what a person thinks and

1814.399 --> 1819.6
focuses

1815.12 --> 1821.4399999999998
on is normal is the normality that they

1819.6 --> 1824.7199999999998
kind of take on

1821.44 --> 1824.72
isn't that just interesting

1828.159 --> 1834.96
i am not mental well i am not

1831.919 --> 1834.96
out of control

1835.6 --> 1845.1999999999998
like on the short run i can

1839.279 --> 1848.96
manage myself it's just that i

1845.2 --> 1851.8400000000001
have a lot of trouble engaging

1848.96 --> 1851.8400000000001
out there

1853.84 --> 1860.08
like as soon as i try something new i

1856.96 --> 1862.32
feel completely lost

1860.08 --> 1864.8799999999999
i feel almost again like a very little

1862.32 --> 1865.279
kid just like oh god the world out there

1864.88 --> 1867.44
ah

1865.279 --> 1870.72
i don't know what's gonna happen it

1867.44 --> 1870.72
makes me really nervous

1871.519 --> 1877.039
i've always had that and i've hated

1875.2 --> 1878.88
that it was always that strong like

1877.039 --> 1880.72
other people are like oh yeah something

1878.88 --> 1881.279
new let's try something fresh and then

1880.72 --> 1884.88
they're

1881.279 --> 1885.279
relieved right oh me trying something

1884.88 --> 1888.7990000000002
new

1885.279 --> 1891.919
something fresh is like ah i hate it

1888.799 --> 1892.72
yeah yeah that's is that normal i feel

1891.919 --> 1895.76
like ah

1892.72 --> 1898.48
i hate it i can't wait until this fresh

1895.76 --> 1901.36
feeling finally is over and i can

1898.48 --> 1907.84
finally get back to peace and just

1901.36 --> 1907.84
integrate with this new thing

1908.799 --> 1912.32
does that make any sense to you when i

1911.2 --> 1921.8400000000001
say it like that

1912.32 --> 1921.84
or do you recognize it

1927.519 --> 1931.039
oh robin's i'm sure of it

1932.24 --> 1936.559
the way you do things i i think i would

1934.96 --> 1939.8400000000001
be very comfortable

1936.559 --> 1943.039
being at such events and in a way i have

1939.84 --> 1949.6
i have associated myself with arts

1943.039 --> 1953.2
i went to quite a few museums i just

1949.6 --> 1953.1999999999998
during that time i was just

1954.48 --> 1960.159
been preoccupied a lot with like

1956.919 --> 1962.3990000000001
dissatisfaction towards myself

1960.159 --> 1964.0
it's like you have to do something like

1962.399 --> 1964.559
every time i saw something good it's

1964.0 --> 1967.2
like

1964.559 --> 1969.12
you didn't do that you're a loser you're

1967.2 --> 1970.799
stupid why can't you just build

1969.12 --> 1972.6399999999999
something big

1970.799 --> 1974.8799999999999
why can't you just finish something it's

1972.64 --> 1977.679
always like this whiny

1974.88 --> 1980.48
stupid bad mother that's just there like

1977.679 --> 1982.799
why can't you do that why could you do

1980.48 --> 1983.6
and that's been nagging on me for a long

1982.799 --> 1985.679
time

1983.6 --> 1987.84
back in the day that that would be

1985.679 --> 1989.44
roughly around 20 years ago that was

1987.84 --> 1992.399
there

1989.44 --> 1993.2
it made me less able to enjoy things and

1992.399 --> 1996.559
also less

1993.2 --> 2000.559
able to consciously study things

1996.559 --> 2002.96
a subconscious i think i still

2000.559 --> 2005.76
got plenty to reflect upon that has

2002.96 --> 2008.32
helped me grow

2005.76 --> 2010.1589999999999
my skill especially from my subconscious

2008.32 --> 2013.36
perspective so it seems like my

2010.159 --> 2015.519
subconscious is a lot more responsible

2013.36 --> 2019.84
and effective and talented than my

2015.519 --> 2019.84
actual conscious

2020.0 --> 2023.919
i feel really weird saying that

2026.559 --> 2033.42
it's very odd when you consciously

2029.279 --> 2036.609
realize something like that

2033.42 --> 2036.6090000000002
[Music]

2051.599 --> 2061.839
all right

2062.24 --> 2065.1189999999997
but yeah art

2065.28 --> 2069.44
art is interesting can't yeah it can be

2067.44 --> 2071.679
very interesting can also be extremely

2069.44 --> 2073.919
intense so it also depends on like

2071.679 --> 2074.8
what mood i would there would be certain

2073.919 --> 2076.96
moods where i would

2074.8 --> 2079.52
absolutely not want to be at art

2076.96 --> 2079.52
galleries

2082.0 --> 2087.28
but if i'm kind of at ease absolutely

2085.04 --> 2089.2
would be very interesting but i think

2087.28 --> 2091.119
that just going to one of those shows of

2089.2 --> 2094.48
yours would be interesting for me just

2091.119 --> 2094.48
to meet you face to face

2095.28 --> 2102.0
and just behold you

2098.64 --> 2117.839
doing what you do from

2102.0 --> 2117.839
more close-ups

2128.839 --> 2134.82
hmm it's great

2131.64 --> 2134.8199999999997
[Music]

2136.4 --> 2145.839
yeah you are awesome robert stanley

2173.04 --> 2178.0
it's yeah now thinking about it it's

2175.28 --> 2178.0
funny because

2178.32 --> 2181.839
like in a way i do understand what

2180.24 --> 2185.2799999999997
you're doing

2181.839 --> 2189.2799999999997
but i understand it through you

2185.28 --> 2192.079
like i understand it like how it works

2189.28 --> 2194.1600000000003
once you engaged it with the grip that

2192.079 --> 2197.44
you got

2194.16 --> 2197.44
now for myself

2197.92 --> 2201.44
i would think that if i would attempt to

2200.0 --> 2203.76
do it things

2201.44 --> 2207.04
that you do i would probably get into a

2203.76 --> 2207.0400000000004
lot of ego conflict

2210.8 --> 2214.4
but yeah you're a very different person

2212.72 --> 2218.24
people do typically

2214.4 --> 2218.2400000000002
confide in you i

2218.32 --> 2224.48
i think i am too judgmental

2221.359 --> 2227.5989999999997
and like it's it's like

2224.48 --> 2228.079
that's my thing like it's in my spirit i

2227.599 --> 2232.6400000000003
i

2228.079 --> 2235.76
never like completely threw it out

2232.64 --> 2235.7599999999998
but like

2236.24 --> 2240.3999999999996
do you know still understand what i mean

2238.0 --> 2240.4
robin

2241.52 --> 2246.56
so yeah you're uniquely suited for that

2244.32 --> 2256.96
sort of thing and in a way my stepmother

2246.56 --> 2260.32
is like that as well

2256.96 --> 2271.839
and i don't know maybe maybe someday

2260.32 --> 2271.839
i will figure out how to do that

2274.64 --> 2281.52
i i think sometimes also is that just

2279.2 --> 2282.3199999999997
the things that i'm doing the way that

2281.52 --> 2284.8
i'm

2282.32 --> 2287.28
studying and trying to figure out things

2284.8 --> 2289.6800000000003
spiritually

2287.28 --> 2291.119
it might be that my ego is just very

2289.68 --> 2293.52
frustrated too

2291.119 --> 2293.52
because

2295.28 --> 2301.3590000000004
like it likes a ruckus it likes

2298.72 --> 2304.0
trolling it likes all these bad things

2301.359 --> 2307.04
and i'm trying to deprive it

2304.0 --> 2310.64
so i feel like if i go

2307.04 --> 2314.88
out there then it might just pop up

2310.64 --> 2314.8799999999997
and just start causing a ruckus

2315.68 --> 2320.24
because it's been deprived for so long

2318.4 --> 2323.76
but

2320.24 --> 2326.0789999999997
i don't know it's not really manifesting

2323.76 --> 2326.48
like that so far because i've been just

2326.079 --> 2329.52
too

2326.48 --> 2331.359
distant people out there and yeah my

2329.52 --> 2333.68
problem right now is like that first

2331.359 --> 2335.2799999999997
threshold it's like okay if i connect if

2333.68 --> 2338.48
i truly do it

2335.28 --> 2340.48
because it is really basic once i do it

2338.48 --> 2343.359
it's done

2340.48 --> 2344.72
i'll probably put myself down quite

2343.359 --> 2347.04
eloquently

2344.72 --> 2348.8799999999997
and then afterward look at like oh damn

2347.04 --> 2351.119
i did much better than i even expected

2348.88 --> 2353.2000000000003
but i couldn't see it as i was doing it

2351.119 --> 2356.56
right i've already done these types of

2353.2 --> 2356.56
experiments for myself

2356.64 --> 2360.16
it's just that i am very nervous in

2359.359 --> 2363.2
actually

2360.16 --> 2365.44
tying in on a deeper level

2363.2 --> 2366.48
with people or doing that by accident

2365.44 --> 2370.16
like can i

2366.48 --> 2372.8
prevent myself from immediately

2370.16 --> 2374.56
laying a deep root because i've been

2372.8 --> 2376.48
deprived for so long can i prevent

2374.56 --> 2379.2799999999997
myself from doing that can i keep it

2376.48 --> 2379.28
superficial

2381.04 --> 2388.0
because i'm almost like ready to just

2383.359 --> 2388.0
dive on to somebody and just be like ah

2392.16 --> 2395.2
like find some beautiful girl and just

2394.56 --> 2398.48
throw out

2395.2 --> 2401.9199999999996
everything but that's not

2398.48 --> 2406.88
probably what people are looking for

2401.92 --> 2406.88
or right or the one that i would want

2408.0 --> 2412.88
it's weird i'm getting a little bit

2410.319 --> 2412.88
blurry now

2416.96 --> 2421.28
you've taken many risks yeah but you're

2419.119 --> 2423.119
pretty good at it

2421.28 --> 2424.88
you've made it your thing i've even had

2423.119 --> 2428.0
periods where once i get

2424.88 --> 2428.0
going like that right

2429.04 --> 2434.96
in that sense i because i have

2432.079 --> 2437.44
engaged okay it's not like oh my god i'm

2434.96 --> 2441.92
almost 41 years old and i've literally

2437.44 --> 2445.359
never had a social life no no i have

2441.92 --> 2448.319
never been a great star at it but i have

2445.359 --> 2449.44
i have engaged in people and like hey

2448.319 --> 2453.2799999999997
what is it

2449.44 --> 2456.4
15 years ago i was very active

2453.28 --> 2459.2000000000003
engaging like really

2456.4 --> 2461.119
like i would step up to anything that

2459.2 --> 2462.319
was interesting in some way it was like

2461.119 --> 2464.88
take it all

2462.319 --> 2467.04
like no matter how crazy these people

2464.88 --> 2469.599
are i will

2467.04 --> 2471.44
figure out what they are how they can be

2469.599 --> 2475.2000000000003
themselves and what that means to them

2471.44 --> 2478.56
what do they see what do they don't see

2475.2 --> 2481.2
it's like very eager to figure things

2478.56 --> 2483.2799999999997
out but

2481.2 --> 2485.2
i've come to a conclusion from that

2483.28 --> 2487.6800000000003
entire thing and that is that yeah

2485.2 --> 2490.24
everybody's just [ __ ] up

2487.68 --> 2490.24
and good

2491.04 --> 2495.7599999999998
but i'm struggling now with the remnants

2493.599 --> 2496.48
of it and that is like okay i figured so

2495.76 --> 2498.0
much out

2496.48 --> 2500.0
and now i have to deal with people out

2498.0 --> 2503.2
there that have not

2500.0 --> 2506.0
and they all have egos and they

2503.2 --> 2508.0
will not be pulled upwards unless they

2506.0 --> 2510.24
feel that calling and there is

2508.0 --> 2512.16
no way to control that it's like either

2510.24 --> 2514.0789999999997
they get the calling or they don't and

2512.16 --> 2517.52
there's nothing i can do about it

2514.079 --> 2519.52
and if i hook up with somebody

2517.52 --> 2520.72
can just be that they just don't get the

2519.52 --> 2523.839
calling and then i

2520.72 --> 2523.839
would then what

2524.48 --> 2529.359
then i walk away maybe i feel stupid

2535.119 --> 2551.839
i don't know i'm theorizing the [ __ ] out

2538.48 --> 2551.839
of this

2563.04 --> 2567.119
finding it trusting fellow travelers

2566.0 --> 2570.4
right

2567.119 --> 2572.7200000000003
and there's also traveler fragments

2570.4 --> 2572.7200000000003
you know

2577.44 --> 2580.7200000000003
like i see it sometimes in just people

2580.16 --> 2583.68
that get

2580.72 --> 2584.56
in them that i've seen for quite a while

2583.68 --> 2588.24
and they just

2584.56 --> 2590.839
the spirit has caught them

2588.24 --> 2592.64
and i wonder like how long is that gonna

2590.839 --> 2594.4
hold

2592.64 --> 2595.68
are they gonna go back in a fallback

2594.4 --> 2598.48
position again or

2595.68 --> 2599.52
is this time is it gonna stick and is

2598.48 --> 2607.839
that gonna make

2599.52 --> 2607.839
them change their life

2626.079 --> 2634.5600000000004
all right anyway sort of a lot of

2630.96 --> 2636.64
reflecting going on and well the way

2634.56 --> 2639.92
that i'm expressing you know i'm a lot

2636.64 --> 2643.2
more satisfied about that

2639.92 --> 2648.64
this is not a proper sentence i'm okay

2643.2 --> 2648.96
with doing this because when i'm still

2648.64 --> 2651.2799999999997
like

2648.96 --> 2653.359
thinking about this stuff and pondering

2651.28 --> 2655.52
and just feeling about it

2653.359 --> 2657.68
it's a lot more negative in my head than

2655.52 --> 2660.8
as i'm unrolling it

2657.68 --> 2662.7999999999997
on the show thank god for that

2660.8 --> 2664.1600000000003
because i'm i don't want to pile all

2662.8 --> 2668.1600000000003
that negative [ __ ]

2664.16 --> 2671.2799999999997
just without anything

2668.16 --> 2673.04
but now that i'm talking about it now i

2671.28 --> 2673.599
can find something constructive in it

2673.04 --> 2677.839
and

2673.599 --> 2677.839
yeah it's okay

2679.28 --> 2682.4
but a lot of the times when i'm not live

2681.599 --> 2684.48
on the show

2682.4 --> 2691.839
these things hang around in my head and

2684.48 --> 2691.839
it becomes very grim

2695.52 --> 2704.24
this is not extreme grim to me grim

2697.839 --> 2706.16
enough that it's just not pleasant

2704.24 --> 2707.839
but yeah as i'm discussing it and

2706.16 --> 2710.0789999999997
reflecting on other people

2707.839 --> 2719.839
it's always better with other people

2710.079 --> 2719.8390000000004
than it is alone like that

2723.04 --> 2733.839
all right

2758.839 --> 2761.839
so

2769.119 --> 2772.4
or am i needed and proceeding with oh

2771.839 --> 2774.72
that's a

2772.4 --> 2778.079
oh that's that's a really good way of

2774.72 --> 2778.0789999999997
putting that robin stanley

2779.119 --> 2794.0
where am i needed

2789.2 --> 2796.56
right well you know what

2794.0 --> 2796.56
in a way

2797.04 --> 2803.2799999999997
i have that sense too and it's it's part

2800.4 --> 2805.2000000000003
why i am really tenaciously also hanging

2803.28 --> 2808.88
onto this show

2805.2 --> 2810.8799999999997
because sometimes i really do wish like

2808.88 --> 2814.319
i could just

2810.88 --> 2816.7200000000003
like throw it all out and

2814.319 --> 2817.7599999999998
and but not forever even it's just like

2816.72 --> 2820.16
i really

2817.76 --> 2822.079
stop it and just go do something else

2820.16 --> 2826.16
but i feel like

2822.079 --> 2828.7200000000003
i've i've dug in my roots here

2826.16 --> 2830.16
in this community even in youtube in in

2828.72 --> 2833.7599999999998
a crazy fashion

2830.16 --> 2837.52
one could say but maybe

2833.76 --> 2838.8
yeah for me because i just throw myself

2837.52 --> 2842.64
out there so

2838.8 --> 2845.76
so honestly and openly and broad

2842.64 --> 2848.5589999999997
very broad every freaking day right

2845.76 --> 2850.6400000000003
and i never just like okay i'm going to

2848.559 --> 2852.559
retract being personal now

2850.64 --> 2854.7999999999997
and just get more standardized

2852.559 --> 2856.559
information

2854.8 --> 2859.3590000000004
and then just leave it for a special

2856.559 --> 2862.8
moment no i'm always

2859.359 --> 2863.68
myself like this and dealing with issues

2862.8 --> 2865.76
and then just

2863.68 --> 2867.44
sharing it as a friend would with a

2865.76 --> 2872.2400000000002
smart friend

2867.44 --> 2875.2000000000003
right here in the open every every time

2872.24 --> 2877.52
because in a way i wish it was more

2875.2 --> 2878.0
normal i think there's more necessity of

2877.52 --> 2880.4
people

2878.0 --> 2881.68
reflecting upon these things because the

2880.4 --> 2886.88
world has become

2881.68 --> 2888.96
complicated and polarized and

2886.88 --> 2891.28
there's more need for the deeper

2888.96 --> 2894.0
introspective reflection but also

2891.28 --> 2894.3190000000004
to have guidance doing it because people

2894.0 --> 2898.079
yo

2894.319 --> 2899.839
so many times just end up in spirals

2898.079 --> 2901.3590000000004
and it doesn't go anywhere it just makes

2899.839 --> 2904.319
them feel shitty and then they have to

2901.359 --> 2904.319
step down again

2904.88 --> 2911.44
when every complexity

2908.0 --> 2912.24
can be analyzed and utilized and

2911.44 --> 2914.2400000000002
transformed

2912.24 --> 2916.7999999999997
every single thing and that's kind of

2914.24 --> 2919.2799999999997
become my specialization by accident as

2916.8 --> 2921.52
a side effect

2919.28 --> 2923.599
from being what i am it's just like i

2921.52 --> 2925.92
could do that okay it's more productive

2923.599 --> 2928.96
than just wallowing

2925.92 --> 2932.079
in nonsense and bad feelings

2928.96 --> 2935.28
so yeah i started doing that

2932.079 --> 2938.2400000000002
this is on a very

2935.28 --> 2939.92
serious level like even as i was young i

2938.24 --> 2941.5989999999997
really took it as like i am going to

2939.92 --> 2945.359
specialize in this beyond

2941.599 --> 2945.3590000000004
people's wildest imagination

2946.72 --> 2951.2799999999997
like figure out the complex esoteric

2949.52 --> 2952.88
mechanics and it didn't even have any

2951.28 --> 2954.1600000000003
words for it back then i didn't even

2952.88 --> 2956.48
know how to express

2954.16 --> 2958.72
that just intuition just like no

2956.48 --> 2959.68
figuring out complexities and with the

2958.72 --> 2961.5989999999997
ego

2959.68 --> 2963.9199999999996
and what do you want and what is real

2961.599 --> 2966.0
and morality and the natural physical

2963.92 --> 2969.599
consequences in the design

2966.0 --> 2972.8
and like be

2969.599 --> 2973.92
so precise and so consistent and

2972.8 --> 2976.559
developing

2973.92 --> 2978.079
with it that's going to blow people's

2976.559 --> 2980.1600000000003
minds

2978.079 --> 2981.76
and it probably would i even knew back

2980.16 --> 2984.7999999999997
then it's like this is going to take a

2981.76 --> 2987.2000000000003
very long time before one people start

2984.8 --> 2988.559
recognizing me for anything other than

2987.2 --> 2991.2799999999997
just a weirdo

2988.559 --> 2992.48
that they don't understand and then

2991.28 --> 2996.4
before they can

2992.48 --> 2999.119
actually see that takes even longer

2996.4 --> 3001.359
before they can actually see that there

2999.119 --> 3004.88
is consistency and that i'm actually

3001.359 --> 3007.04
trying to attempt to figure out

3004.88 --> 3009.119
a growing issue in the world and that is

3007.04 --> 3010.8
that the world is becoming more complex

3009.119 --> 3013.92
more psychologically

3010.8 --> 3014.88
invasive and manipulative how do you

3013.92 --> 3018.7200000000003
deal with that

3014.88 --> 3020.559
most people have just focused on

3018.72 --> 3023.2
how do you build your life up what's the

3020.559 --> 3025.599
next action

3023.2 --> 3027.359
they don't have fractal thinking which

3025.599 --> 3027.76
is kind of like what that is what i'm

3027.359 --> 3030.0789999999997
doing

3027.76 --> 3031.92
it's like constantly fractal approach

3030.079 --> 3033.599
fractal thinking always looking at the

3031.92 --> 3035.6800000000003
consequences beyond

3033.599 --> 3038.079
that would naturally arrive and have a

3035.68 --> 3039.5989999999997
consistent pattern for it

3038.079 --> 3042.7200000000003
at least in your mind whether you're

3039.599 --> 3045.52
able to communicate that

3042.72 --> 3047.5989999999997
properly is a whole other challenge but

3045.52 --> 3048.96
just getting it right in your mind is

3047.599 --> 3055.839
already a challenge

3048.96 --> 3055.839
in this age

3057.839 --> 3062.64
and i knew that i knew that it was going

3061.359 --> 3066.839
to be a challenge i knew

3062.64 --> 3070.24
way back way back like say 30 years ago

3066.839 --> 3073.44
roughly started to well no

3070.24 --> 3076.3999999999996
25 years ago it started it

3073.44 --> 3077.599
glare out onto me from the outside

3076.4 --> 3080.079
worlds like

3077.599 --> 3082.079
if you're just going to pick something

3080.079 --> 3086.079
pick the next thing to do

3082.079 --> 3088.96
and just not focus except on just

3086.079 --> 3091.44
the next step to do you're gonna end up

3088.96 --> 3093.359
in a ditch

3091.44 --> 3095.52
one that you can't get out of because

3093.359 --> 3098.0789999999997
you didn't develop the skills to

3095.52 --> 3100.16
prevent yourself from eventually ending

3098.079 --> 3102.559
up in that ditch because you were just

3100.16 --> 3106.24
focusing on the next

3102.559 --> 3110.7200000000003
task and being efficient at it

3106.24 --> 3111.359
i felt that like very viscerally felt

3110.72 --> 3114.3999999999996
that

3111.359 --> 3116.7999999999997
like as a as like a entire

3114.4 --> 3119.04
as an energy structure that was just

3116.8 --> 3119.599
there presenting itself like if you do

3119.04 --> 3121.44
this

3119.599 --> 3122.96
this is what's gonna happen if you do

3121.44 --> 3124.2400000000002
this this is what's gonna happen yes

3122.96 --> 3126.48
everybody's doing that

3124.24 --> 3129.9199999999996
everybody is choosing that that thing

3126.48 --> 3131.68
that i see that is going to happen

3129.92 --> 3133.119
you can't do that you want to do that

3131.68 --> 3135.44
because i

3133.119 --> 3137.76
if especially back then want to not

3135.44 --> 3138.0
stand out too much it's uncomfortable i

3137.76 --> 3140.88
want

3138.0 --> 3142.16
to be just like the rest i also want to

3140.88 --> 3145.2000000000003
appeal to

3142.16 --> 3147.2799999999997
group i want to be able to be so much

3145.2 --> 3147.839
like everybody that i can stand up and

3147.28 --> 3150.559
speak

3147.839 --> 3153.839
for the group and kind of bring in a

3150.559 --> 3156.1600000000003
little of myself

3153.839 --> 3158.4
like that that's all the things that i

3156.16 --> 3162.24
wanted all the way back then

3158.4 --> 3164.96
but i knew from just that imagery

3162.24 --> 3166.72
esoterically presenting itself like if

3164.96 --> 3167.119
you're just going to be like everybody

3166.72 --> 3169.839
else

3167.119 --> 3173.359
you are going to end up in a ditch and

3169.839 --> 3176.64
you will feel very stupid

3173.359 --> 3180.72
for it or fatalistic and like

3176.64 --> 3182.24
degrade your own capabilities

3180.72 --> 3185.2799999999997
by saying now i couldn't have done

3182.24 --> 3185.2799999999997
anything to prevent it

3186.8 --> 3192.6400000000003
it just yeah i was very confronted with

3190.559 --> 3196.7200000000003
that on the spiritual level like

3192.64 --> 3196.72
it's just it came in my dreams

3197.28 --> 3200.079
constantly

3200.48 --> 3207.2
so it's like around that age it felt to

3204.48 --> 3210.8
me like society was seducing me

3207.2 --> 3214.0789999999997
to basically become part of

3210.8 --> 3218.8
that failure

3214.079 --> 3223.8390000000004
that degrading way of doing this it sees

3218.8 --> 3223.8390000000004
and that sounds so

3224.079 --> 3227.119
bad in a way it's like

3233.04 --> 3239.7599999999998
like what society kind of makes you into

3236.48 --> 3242.16
is what is generally regarded as normal

3239.76 --> 3243.92
but it is actually not normal it is

3242.16 --> 3251.839
degrading

3243.92 --> 3251.839
but people can and do adapt to it anyway

3262.8 --> 3267.28
and to me it just seemed like it was a

3264.88 --> 3271.119
giant satanic seduction

3267.28 --> 3274.0
really that's what i was confronted with

3271.119 --> 3274.4
in my teens like you want to be part of

3274.0 --> 3276.839
this

3274.4 --> 3279.839
you got to lay down everything

3276.839 --> 3279.839
everything

3280.48 --> 3284.72
and and then even yeah things got even

3284.079 --> 3288.7200000000003
worse

3284.72 --> 3291.04
out there it's like oh now suddenly

3288.72 --> 3293.68
when you're white you're bad well i

3291.04 --> 3295.68
always associated myself with white

3293.68 --> 3299.7599999999998
even though i'm not perfectly white

3295.68 --> 3303.52
because i have relatively pale skin

3299.76 --> 3305.6800000000003
right so it was getting even worse it's

3303.52 --> 3308.88
like the idea is like okay just

3305.68 --> 3312.48
integrate adapt is going to mean

3308.88 --> 3315.599
absolute doom and then eventually

3312.48 --> 3317.52
yeah i sort of bumped into alex jones

3315.599 --> 3320.0
after half or having already stepped

3317.52 --> 3323.119
away and that emphasized it even more

3320.0 --> 3326.16
but because in a way it is true

3323.119 --> 3328.88
and at the same time like there's this

3326.16 --> 3330.319
constant conflict now going on as to

3328.88 --> 3334.079
like yeah but there is no

3330.319 --> 3337.2799999999997
real alternative

3334.079 --> 3339.599
still in the middle of society i still

3337.28 --> 3342.1600000000003
go out for grocery shopping i still

3339.599 --> 3344.559
live in a rented house i have live on

3342.16 --> 3346.72
social welfare so i am in society but i

3344.559 --> 3349.76
try not to be

3346.72 --> 3355.04
but kind of failing at it

3349.76 --> 3355.0400000000004
from that specific perspective

3355.52 --> 3362.799
but at least i'm not completely tied up

3358.559 --> 3365.52
in in situations that are slowly

3362.799 --> 3366.319
ringing like squeezing the life out of

3365.52 --> 3368.96
me or

3366.319 --> 3371.92
rapidly squeezing the life out of me i

3368.96 --> 3375.119
still have a lot of my spirit that i've

3371.92 --> 3377.839
maintained because of this choice i

3375.119 --> 3377.839
guess

3385.28 --> 3391.92
and i've been able to now yeah do this

3388.88 --> 3396.079
unique thing this cosmogeny thing this

3391.92 --> 3400.319
flat earth and really

3396.079 --> 3400.319
make it into sort of a profession

3400.799 --> 3404.319
right and so to bring it all back to

3402.96 --> 3407.359
where this started out

3404.319 --> 3411.599
like i'm not just go i can't just step

3407.359 --> 3411.5989999999997
away from this but in a way

3412.559 --> 3416.6400000000003
sometimes i will wish i just had more

3414.72 --> 3417.4399999999996
room but i have to realize that even

3416.64 --> 3419.2
though

3417.44 --> 3420.96
yeah this is all through the internet

3419.2 --> 3425.4399999999996
and most people

3420.96 --> 3425.44
that are my friends here that i do know

3427.92 --> 3430.079
like

3431.52 --> 3434.88
i have a responsibility here because

3434.24 --> 3437.9199999999996
that's

3434.88 --> 3439.76
the choice that i made and if i step

3437.92 --> 3441.599
away from it it's going to be a great

3439.76 --> 3442.3190000000004
loss it's probably going to ruin a lot

3441.599 --> 3444.7200000000003
of things

3442.319 --> 3446.16
like a lot of balance that i got so this

3444.72 --> 3447.9199999999996
is just the way it works

3446.16 --> 3450.24
so i'm gonna have to do it and gonna

3447.92 --> 3452.799
have to sit through it

3450.24 --> 3455.68
and figure out every single day as to

3452.799 --> 3460.0
what am i talking about

3455.68 --> 3465.04
and hey at least i'm not talking about

3460.0 --> 3467.92
standard nonsense right it's like

3465.04 --> 3470.4
constant introspective refract of

3467.92 --> 3472.88
reflection it's almost like a

3470.4 --> 3475.04
a spiral in its own way what i talk

3472.88 --> 3478.4
about most of the time but at least

3475.04 --> 3480.0
it's not standardized stuff like almost

3478.4 --> 3482.319
everything else out there

3480.0 --> 3482.319
right

3484.64 --> 3488.0
i think that at least what i do does

3487.04 --> 3491.7599999999998
kind of

3488.0 --> 3493.28
tintellate does make you see hopefully a

3491.76 --> 3496.2400000000002
little sharper

3493.28 --> 3498.4
in an esoteric sense i hope i hope it

3496.24 --> 3500.8799999999997
really does

3498.4 --> 3503.839
because if it doesn't then then i am

3500.88 --> 3503.839
completely useless

3509.44 --> 3514.799
because that's really what i'm trying to

3511.119 --> 3517.04
do i'm at the way that i dig through

3514.799 --> 3519.68
for myself psychologically and figuring

3517.04 --> 3523.2
it out esoterically and just

3519.68 --> 3524.0
everything spirit i'm trying to put that

3523.2 --> 3527.359
down

3524.0 --> 3530.24
so that others can get a better

3527.359 --> 3533.359
grip on the complexities of this world

3530.24 --> 3537.359
and what it means to be a human being

3533.359 --> 3545.839
and a unique spirit to deal with the ego

3537.359 --> 3545.839
and all that

3550.16 --> 3553.839
so many people out there that

3554.64 --> 3558.48
should be doing exactly what i'm doing

3556.96 --> 3560.88
right now

3558.48 --> 3562.96
except not not necessarily even like on

3560.88 --> 3565.599
the internet or anything but just

3562.96 --> 3567.599
this process and doing it well and not

3565.599 --> 3569.599
getting stuck up by the ego and then

3567.599 --> 3571.52
thinking it's okay to do that

3569.599 --> 3573.839
because not everybody's watching it's

3571.52 --> 3576.16
just a person

3573.839 --> 3577.7599999999998
so it's okay to just let your ego latch

3576.16 --> 3580.5589999999997
onto something and then just

3577.76 --> 3582.079
start squirting over that right because

3580.559 --> 3585.44
a lot of people that

3582.079 --> 3589.28
need to really

3585.44 --> 3592.88
sharpen their inside and their esoterics

3589.28 --> 3596.079
get caught up on ego things

3592.88 --> 3601.119
it's like level one

3596.079 --> 3603.92
pit trap and almost every one

3601.119 --> 3606.4
no matter how smart you are falls into

3603.92 --> 3609.92
that pit trap

3606.4 --> 3612.4
almost everyone does it and

3609.92 --> 3615.839
almost everyone has it as a continuing

3612.4 --> 3615.839
theme throughout their life

3621.599 --> 3629.52
and in a way for example being triggered

3625.839 --> 3631.52
by trolls like having them touch you

3629.52 --> 3632.559
and then making you respect that is

3631.52 --> 3642.48
already that is

3632.559 --> 3646.559
also that pitfall but it's everywhere

3642.48 --> 3649.119
anyway i'm losing cohesion

3646.559 --> 3649.6800000000003
in my train of thinking like the spiral

3649.119 --> 3652.079
has been

3649.68 --> 3654.839
spiraling on and at some point it starts

3652.079 --> 3657.8390000000004
to lose cohesion and i just have to drop

3654.839 --> 3657.839
it

3663.359 --> 3667.2
even the anger you have put out is

3666.079 --> 3671.04
within borders

3667.2 --> 3673.2799999999997
i can understand it right

3671.04 --> 3676.88
well i would have to like you can't let

3673.28 --> 3676.88
your anger have no limits

3677.44 --> 3681.119
and to be fair the anger that i've put

3679.92 --> 3684.16
out

3681.119 --> 3687.28
i do think i went too far

3684.16 --> 3687.839
right now compared to a lot of other

3687.28 --> 3689.8390000000004
people

3687.839 --> 3692.64
when they do it yeah i didn't went too

3689.839 --> 3695.04
far i didn't turn into a complete maniac

3692.64 --> 3697.2799999999997
like an actual like in this moment

3695.04 --> 3698.48
complete goblin expression or whatever

3697.28 --> 3701.0400000000004
right

3698.48 --> 3702.319
didn't turn into a really dirty little

3701.04 --> 3704.319
demon

3702.319 --> 3706.48
that didn't realize they turned into a

3704.319 --> 3709.04
dirty little demon i don't go there

3706.48 --> 3709.88
i have in the past though it makes me

3709.04 --> 3713.839
feel

3709.88 --> 3713.839
very very ugly

3714.079 --> 3720.1600000000003
so yeah but i have

3717.68 --> 3721.5989999999997
said things where i just feel really

3720.16 --> 3724.48
stupid for saying it

3721.599 --> 3724.48
in my anger

3724.799 --> 3730.0
like when i start to say like oh when in

3728.079 --> 3731.6800000000003
the heat of the moment i really like

3730.0 --> 3734.079
push it and just say like i

3731.68 --> 3735.0389999999998
kill everyone or something you know that

3734.079 --> 3738.8390000000004
makes me feel

3735.039 --> 3742.3190000000004
really ashamed of myself that

3738.839 --> 3744.4
that it's sort of like a berserker thing

3742.319 --> 3747.52
that happens

3744.4 --> 3750.64
it's just stupid

3747.52 --> 3751.599
i got seduced by an imagery and a

3750.64 --> 3756.319
release

3751.599 --> 3761.28
that makes no damn sense for the moment

3756.319 --> 3763.52
and probably ever maybe in

3761.28 --> 3764.48
the far future or whatever some

3763.52 --> 3768.0
offspring

3764.48 --> 3770.319
somewhere will need that

3768.0 --> 3772.88
but right now it's just stupid it makes

3770.319 --> 3774.799
no sense it's very counterproductive and

3772.88 --> 3776.7200000000003
even though yeah it's reasonable

3774.799 --> 3777.28
compared to a lot of what else was out

3776.72 --> 3779.359
there

3777.28 --> 3780.3190000000004
it still makes me feel stupid when that

3779.359 --> 3783.2799999999997
happens

3780.319 --> 3783.68
now i'm not proud of it even though it

3783.28 --> 3786.6400000000003
is

3783.68 --> 3788.0789999999997
real you know and yeah that's another

3786.64 --> 3791.2
way of judging it's like oh at least

3788.079 --> 3794.2400000000002
it's real yeah i know it's real

3791.2 --> 3797.5989999999997
but that's it being real

3794.24 --> 3801.2
is not the only important thing to me

3797.599 --> 3803.92
at least right

3801.2 --> 3805.2799999999997
hey later roger thanks for popping by

3803.92 --> 3807.92
hope you

3805.28 --> 3807.92
enjoyed it

3808.72 --> 3811.839
this first hour

3816.96 --> 3825.839
my detractors fell away what

3820.799 --> 3825.839
couldn't take the joy

3836.839 --> 3839.839
huh

3847.44 --> 3849.76
right

3850.96 --> 3856.16
anyway enough with the introspective

3853.92 --> 3856.16
stuff

3861.28 --> 3866.2400000000002
but yeah i do struggle a lot inside

3865.2 --> 3870.48
myself with

3866.24 --> 3875.359
like am i doing good enough is this

3870.48 --> 3877.52
is this useful and then all right

3875.359 --> 3878.96
is it good enough it's like is the

3877.52 --> 3881.599
decision is the actions

3878.96 --> 3884.16
are is it good enough is there such a

3881.599 --> 3886.319
thing as good enough

3884.16 --> 3895.839
i'm supposed to imagine what god looks

3886.319 --> 3895.839
like well i don't

3898.0 --> 3903.039
i when it comes to god the actual

3900.799 --> 3907.359
creator the designer i

3903.039 --> 3911.28
id personify as much as i can

3907.359 --> 3911.2799999999997
because i think personification is an

3920.839 --> 3925.92
error

3922.799 --> 3928.64
what does it mean when you see see the

3925.92 --> 3928.64
face of god

3928.96 --> 3931.52
oh seek

3934.4 --> 3939.039
ah that's a complicated one gaining

3937.28 --> 3943.6800000000003
wisdom

3939.039 --> 3946.96
i think it is probably a metaphor and it

3943.68 --> 3948.799
basically expresses when you seek the

3946.96 --> 3953.2
face of god

3948.799 --> 3953.2
you want to realize

3953.28 --> 3960.1600000000003
reality and god

3956.96 --> 3961.28
and the designer as part of it so to see

3960.16 --> 3964.64
the face of god

3961.28 --> 3967.28
is to more

3964.64 --> 3968.799
rather recognize the face of god because

3967.28 --> 3972.6400000000003
the face of god is there

3968.799 --> 3976.48
it's in everything all things are

3972.64 --> 3979.52
of god like

3976.48 --> 3982.96
have been designed by uh

3979.52 --> 3983.839
and yeah throughout time roll out

3982.96 --> 3987.2
because of

3983.839 --> 3990.0
so seeing that but

3987.2 --> 3990.72
actually seeing and not just printing in

3990.0 --> 3993.119
on it like

3990.72 --> 3994.16
it's not just like oh something created

3993.119 --> 3996.079
that so

3994.16 --> 3998.24
now i'm going to imagine literally a

3996.079 --> 3999.52
face on everything like there's a face

3998.24 --> 4002.9599999999996
on every molecule

3999.52 --> 4006.64
of god or something no but it is

4002.96 --> 4010.96
just the realization

4006.64 --> 4010.96
seeking the face of god to me is seeing

4012.0 --> 4019.44
how it all is

4015.44 --> 4022.64
or further seeing more

4019.44 --> 4024.2400000000002
so stepping away from distractions

4022.64 --> 4026.96
like things you want to do things you

4024.24 --> 4028.16
have to do the way you need to look at

4026.96 --> 4032.4
things to get around

4028.16 --> 4036.5589999999997
right and just actually look at it all

4032.4 --> 4040.4
and realize where

4036.559 --> 4044.0
it all comes from in a way what it

4040.4 --> 4046.2400000000002
all would have to mean and why

4044.0 --> 4048.079
and all the bigger things and then just

4046.24 --> 4049.7599999999998
a giant overarching structure

4048.079 --> 4063.8390000000004
and that is the face of god it's the

4049.76 --> 4063.8390000000004
pattern it's all things

4065.359 --> 4070.16
right okay well it when it comes to

4068.319 --> 4073.0389999999998
other people

4070.16 --> 4074.799
i don't seek the face of god in people

4073.039 --> 4076.079
because people have their own face they

4074.799 --> 4077.2
have their own spirit and they have

4076.079 --> 4081.52
their ego

4077.2 --> 4084.799
so it's always like okay what

4081.52 --> 4088.72
is their ego pulling them towards

4084.799 --> 4092.559
and what is there this

4088.72 --> 4094.319
escape from that through

4092.559 --> 4096.2390000000005
through their talents through their

4094.319 --> 4100.0
blessings through their

4096.239 --> 4100.0
spiritual origin

4102.719 --> 4109.44
and then you just try to stimulate the

4105.359 --> 4109.4400000000005
right side and discourage the other

4113.92 --> 4121.679
but i try not to seek or project

4117.52 --> 4121.679
god onto another

4122.48 --> 4125.759
or even onto myself

4126.239 --> 4130.159
it's like every time it's like no trying

4129.04 --> 4134.0
to take away

4130.159 --> 4137.04
from that which is all and then

4134.0 --> 4139.279
degrading it by making it specific even

4137.04 --> 4143.12
just with your attention

4139.279 --> 4143.120000000001
and i just like no no

4144.159 --> 4150.96
it's all things equally

4147.52 --> 4153.1990000000005
and oh suddenly things

4150.96 --> 4154.0
seem to not make any more sense to you

4153.199 --> 4156.159
because of that

4154.0 --> 4158.88
you know but this and that yeah yeah

4156.159 --> 4163.759
that's your problem

4158.88 --> 4168.2390000000005
this is literally your ego that's

4163.759 --> 4168.239
use the your own interpretation

4168.96 --> 4172.0
their own puzzle of approach and then in

4171.199 --> 4176.3189999999995
that puzzle

4172.0 --> 4179.839
crashes so that's your

4176.319 --> 4189.759
inability to understand why

4179.839 --> 4191.92
why all things

4189.759 --> 4193.759
it's like the only problems we have are

4191.92 --> 4197.92
the ones that we conjure up

4193.759 --> 4203.84
ourselves in our own distractions

4197.92 --> 4203.84
and our own attempt to just get by

4214.84 --> 4217.84
hmm

4218.4 --> 4230.639999999999
but i always do seek out the special

4221.6 --> 4232.64
traits and the good tendencies in people

4230.64 --> 4234.56
but it has been confusing though because

4232.64 --> 4236.0
i've also noticed that there is another

4234.56 --> 4237.92
effect going

4236.0 --> 4239.84
that's the other way around where people

4237.92 --> 4243.1990000000005
actually if you just

4239.84 --> 4246.2390000000005
like if in private

4243.199 --> 4247.28
when they don't know you you show that

4246.239 --> 4250.799999999999
you have

4247.28 --> 4254.639999999999
really stupid sides or bad traits

4250.8 --> 4254.64
then they're like relieved

4255.28 --> 4259.04
because yeah you're just a human like

4258.239 --> 4262.5599999999995
that see

4259.04 --> 4264.159
you're oh it's not not so super special

4262.56 --> 4265.92
after it's just a human so you don't

4264.159 --> 4268.799999999999
have to have

4265.92 --> 4269.1990000000005
all this anticipation and tension over

4268.8 --> 4273.04
it

4269.199 --> 4275.199
i've noticed that as well out there

4273.04 --> 4276.08
and i've actively tried to step away

4275.199 --> 4277.919999999999
from that

4276.08 --> 4279.199
i do still recognize like yeah yeah

4277.92 --> 4282.96
still human being still

4279.199 --> 4285.678999999999
all the stupidity the flaws and all that

4282.96 --> 4286.0
but i am a perfectionist i'm not doing

4285.679 --> 4290.08
it like

4286.0 --> 4293.6
that i'm not going to show like

4290.08 --> 4301.84
diffuse tension by sinning

4293.6 --> 4301.84
even if just in a minor way

4312.32 --> 4317.44
all right anyway hey good to see you in

4314.159 --> 4317.44
chat by the way gaining wisdom

4325.28 --> 4329.84
oh i'm getting hungry

4339.82 --> 4343.0
[Music]

4374.0 --> 4378.96
right oh and by the way what i just

4376.32 --> 4378.96
referenced to

4382.84 --> 4385.84
like

4387.199 --> 4389.44
like

4390.8 --> 4395.12
how do you even call that it's like

4393.44 --> 4397.839999999999
virtue signaling with

4395.12 --> 4400.8
minor sins just to show that you're just

4397.84 --> 4400.8
a pathetic human

4403.6 --> 4406.96
even in minor ways just to show you got

4406.32 --> 4409.759999999999
flaws

4406.96 --> 4411.76
and then using that to diffuse tension

4409.76 --> 4414.4800000000005
in somebody else that is

4411.76 --> 4415.679
i guess nervous about themselves it's

4414.48 --> 4417.919999999999
that is effectively

4415.679 --> 4419.28
lowering yourself to somebody else and

4417.92 --> 4422.159
that can help

4419.28 --> 4424.719
them to feel more at ease right i used

4422.159 --> 4427.199
to do that sort of [ __ ]

4424.719 --> 4428.96
when i was a teen and even beyond that

4427.199 --> 4431.678999999999
unfortunately

4428.96 --> 4431.679
because i thought

4434.32 --> 4440.0
like despite my non-engagement policies

4437.52 --> 4442.719
in many ways that i'd still have to

4440.0 --> 4444.48
have do that right still get around like

4442.719 --> 4446.719
that

4444.48 --> 4447.5199999999995
and i'm really talking about really

4446.719 --> 4451.44
minor stuff

4447.52 --> 4455.040000000001
because i've always been very tidy

4451.44 --> 4456.639999999999
moral wise like

4455.04 --> 4458.32
even throughout the gothic scene can you

4456.64 --> 4460.159000000001
imagine how annoying

4458.32 --> 4462.4
they actually thought i was a lot of

4460.159 --> 4462.4
them

4464.8 --> 4469.84
because i would just never let anything

4466.88 --> 4469.84
slip like

4473.76 --> 4476.88
and that's where i ended up eventually

4475.44 --> 4479.678999999999
it's like no

4476.88 --> 4479.679
it's not about

4480.84 --> 4487.360000000001
diffusing tension

4484.32 --> 4489.04
by showing you're just a stupid human

4487.36 --> 4492.96
being just like everybody else

4489.04 --> 4495.679
no eventually it becomes no no no that's

4492.96 --> 4496.0
normal like that should be done like you

4495.679 --> 4499.6
wipe

4496.0 --> 4502.8
your nose like literally

4499.6 --> 4506.08
they want you to actually normalize it

4502.8 --> 4507.04
to normalize sin to make it no big an

4506.08 --> 4509.5199999999995
issue

4507.04 --> 4511.92
and to basically dislocate your spirit

4509.52 --> 4513.6
from the actual consequences of what it

4511.92 --> 4515.84
is you're doing even though it might be

4513.6 --> 4520.159000000001
a minor thing

4515.84 --> 4522.88
but no it's actually

4520.159 --> 4524.719
they want that spirit to be disconnected

4522.88 --> 4526.52
from

4524.719 --> 4528.2390000000005
con in its conscious from

4526.52 --> 4531.679
[Music]

4528.239 --> 4534.879999999999
that it is a sin so it's not even about

4531.679 --> 4538.2390000000005
sinning it's about not

4534.88 --> 4541.679
like disclaiming it is

4538.239 --> 4544.239
a sin you understand that's what it's

4541.679 --> 4547.92
really about

4544.239 --> 4550.4
with satanists the real dark ones

4547.92 --> 4552.08
it's not about that you sin it's about

4550.4 --> 4556.159
that you

4552.08 --> 4558.5599999999995
no longer recognize it is a sin

4556.159 --> 4559.199
that it has a spiritual consequence that

4558.56 --> 4566.8
it does

4559.199 --> 4569.839999999999
things to you the design logos

4566.8 --> 4572.08
and yeah that obviously leads into

4569.84 --> 4574.32
demonic territory everybody that does

4572.08 --> 4574.32
that

4574.48 --> 4580.718999999999
loses part of their humanity

4577.92 --> 4581.76
for as long as they hold on to that and

4580.719 --> 4585.679
yeah there's

4581.76 --> 4589.92
a whole range of people that seem to be

4585.679 --> 4589.92
very willing to hold on to that forever

4592.159 --> 4595.839999999999
and they turn completely demonic

4599.679 --> 4603.84
right well robin stanley in a way i was

4602.08 --> 4606.96
really like a stick in the mod

4603.84 --> 4609.52
among a group of rebels i got in there

4606.96 --> 4611.28
because i thought i was a rebel

4609.52 --> 4613.6
then i just noticed there's all these a

4611.28 --> 4616.639999999999
lot of them were just like

4613.6 --> 4618.8
they they go too far so i try to be

4616.64 --> 4620.84
like no no let's not go too far let's

4618.8 --> 4623.84
stay

4620.84 --> 4623.84
responsible

4626.159 --> 4631.92
eventually the people recognized this

4629.52 --> 4633.1990000000005
from me and then kind of stayed away

4631.92 --> 4635.04
from me

4633.199 --> 4638.239
that would typically go too far i

4635.04 --> 4638.239
thought that was normal

4640.4 --> 4646.0
but yeah that was like

4643.84 --> 4647.92
after already roll into the scene

4646.0 --> 4649.92
thought like oh this is my new place

4647.92 --> 4653.84
this is my new group but then i realized

4649.92 --> 4653.84
like what is actually going on there

4656.64 --> 4659.84
in many ways it's like a sliding skill

4658.88 --> 4662.88
and a lot of people

4659.84 --> 4665.84
don't slide down but a whole bunch of

4662.88 --> 4665.84
people do

4667.679 --> 4672.159
and it's like once it's like this weird

4670.4 --> 4674.5599999999995
expectancy that once you

4672.159 --> 4676.48
decide that certain things are no longer

4674.56 --> 4681.120000000001
a sin

4676.48 --> 4683.28
then those people find it offensive

4681.12 --> 4686.159
when you point out to them it's a sin

4683.28 --> 4689.759999999999
it's like pointing out their lie

4686.159 --> 4693.839999999999
to them and they can get

4689.76 --> 4693.84
really pissed off for it

4702.32 --> 4706.799999999999
but yeah it's a demonic sliding scale

4704.88 --> 4711.52
it's effectively what it is

4706.8 --> 4715.1990000000005
and yeah it was not the place for me

4711.52 --> 4716.64
it was not it didn't didn't feel right i

4715.199 --> 4720.799999999999
didn't want to

4716.64 --> 4723.679
see people do that constantly

4720.8 --> 4723.679
so i got out

4728.719 --> 4733.52
the square bohemian art girl robin

4732.08 --> 4735.84
stanley

4733.52 --> 4735.84
oh

4736.88 --> 4739.76
i love that

4746.56 --> 4753.4400000000005
i'm such a square or maybe

4750.32 --> 4756.5599999999995
rectangle rectan i'm i'm

4753.44 --> 4760.32
i'm rectangular and i'm loopy

4756.56 --> 4761.4400000000005
so yeah i guess it was only natural that

4760.32 --> 4776.4
i would end up

4761.44 --> 4790.32
doing what i do

4776.4 --> 4793.599999999999
a that flat fellow one

4790.32 --> 4794.5599999999995
right but anyway robin stanley look i

4793.6 --> 4797.04
wasn't even like

4794.56 --> 4798.96
really completely goth never really was

4797.04 --> 4801.36
well in a way i did

4798.96 --> 4802.88
but i would always be like i came from

4801.36 --> 4806.88
hippies

4802.88 --> 4810.32
before that like before the goth

4806.88 --> 4813.12
i weared like a lot of colors

4810.32 --> 4813.12
a lot of it

4813.76 --> 4819.04
and then i kind of started mixing it in

4816.0 --> 4821.679
started to get all gothy and [ __ ]

4819.04 --> 4823.04
get spikies on in retrospect yeah that's

4821.679 --> 4825.36
kind of gay

4823.04 --> 4827.5199999999995
but i didn't feel it as gay like

4825.36 --> 4828.5599999999995
literally like that did not enter my

4827.52 --> 4832.639
mind and i was

4828.56 --> 4834.0
absolutely not gay never have been

4832.639 --> 4836.4800000000005
and that's weird to realize in

4834.0 --> 4838.639
retrospect but hey even like

4836.48 --> 4839.839999999999
if you would think it was gay it didn't

4838.639 --> 4841.92
look gay on me

4839.84 --> 4843.52
like if there was something off that i

4841.92 --> 4846.0
would recognize as gay now

4843.52 --> 4847.280000000001
yeah gay is getting very esoteric at

4846.0 --> 4849.04
this point it's no longer just

4847.28 --> 4851.84
homosexuality or whatever

4849.04 --> 4854.32
just the way it looks i was always very

4851.84 --> 4856.88
conscious of the way i looked

4854.32 --> 4858.799999999999
and made sure it didn't look gay and

4856.88 --> 4860.639
sometimes i failed at it

4858.8 --> 4862.719
because i didn't really know how to fix

4860.639 --> 4867.04
it whatever or whatever

4862.719 --> 4867.04
image i was going to do but whatever

4867.52 --> 4871.040000000001
but i i came from the hippie scene or

4870.32 --> 4875.44
there's nothing

4871.04 --> 4878.159
not even a scene no what scene no scene

4875.44 --> 4880.0
my parents especially my mother was kind

4878.159 --> 4883.44
of hippie-ish

4880.0 --> 4885.36
so it came really from that and i just

4883.44 --> 4886.799999999999
felt like yeah now i'm one of the family

4885.36 --> 4890.32
but then eventually i

4886.8 --> 4893.6
turned into like a dark hippie it's

4890.32 --> 4895.5199999999995
so stupid calling it that but

4893.6 --> 4897.92
blended it into the goth and then

4895.52 --> 4900.320000000001
eventually the hippie i realized like

4897.92 --> 4900.32
what it

4901.52 --> 4904.400000000001
yeah what it is

4905.679 --> 4911.36
and then looking what it's basically

4907.84 --> 4911.360000000001
done to my mother in a way too

4911.44 --> 4917.36
and then i kind of like dropped that out

4914.639 --> 4921.04
of it

4917.36 --> 4922.5599999999995
then i eventually yeah also dropped the

4921.04 --> 4925.92
spikes and everything and now

4922.56 --> 4928.8
then i ended up just full black

4925.92 --> 4928.8
started wearing

4929.199 --> 4936.159
just the jewelry that i made

4932.4 --> 4936.159
and that's where i am now

4936.239 --> 4946.32
but i have happiness in me

4944.239 --> 4959.839999999999
i've heard a lot of those types of music

4946.32 --> 4959.84
also through my parents of course

4963.12 --> 4973.84
but yeah

4980.96 --> 4990.4
tidy goth right

4986.4 --> 4992.96
moral wise i was very careful

4990.4 --> 4994.719
well not even super careful i didn't

4992.96 --> 4996.88
have a lot of

4994.719 --> 4997.84
i didn't have like a bible to reflect

4996.88 --> 5001.4400000000005
upon i just

4997.84 --> 5003.84
went by my intuition

5001.44 --> 5004.879999999999
also being like okay people have to make

5003.84 --> 5006.88
their mistakes

5004.88 --> 5008.32
i did kind of know that it's like i

5006.88 --> 5010.2390000000005
didn't just i just didn't really

5008.32 --> 5013.5199999999995
understand why i didn't understand the

5010.239 --> 5015.759999999999
existential consequences of it really

5013.52 --> 5016.56
like i knew it i just didn't know what

5015.76 --> 5020.56
it meant

5016.56 --> 5024.4800000000005
what it meant i was not sure about that

5020.56 --> 5026.8
but i've always had like just basic

5024.48 --> 5028.0
spirit of like no no no you spit you

5026.8 --> 5032.159000000001
stand up for the

5028.0 --> 5034.08
oppressed you help people that are in

5032.159 --> 5038.719
trouble

5034.08 --> 5041.12
and if somebody goes too far

5038.719 --> 5042.0
gets carried away you try to stop them

5041.12 --> 5045.92
before damage

5042.0 --> 5047.84
happens oh super basic super basic

5045.92 --> 5050.4800000000005
if i wouldn't have had that i would i

5047.84 --> 5052.8
don't know where it could have ended up

5050.48 --> 5055.04
i could have potentially just ended up

5052.8 --> 5060.159000000001
in sick

5055.04 --> 5060.159
really sick circles glad that i didn't

5069.04 --> 5072.32
anybody's still out there

5083.199 --> 5103.839999999999
right butterfly

5099.6 --> 5106.639
right one thing that i've noticed about

5103.84 --> 5108.32
like styles too like looking back at

5106.639 --> 5110.8
photographs from my teens

5108.32 --> 5112.88
when i was still wearing hippie clothing

5110.8 --> 5115.76
and all that

5112.88 --> 5115.76
the problem was

5116.159 --> 5119.5199999999995
and i didn't even realize that it's

5118.56 --> 5122.8
really weird

5119.52 --> 5126.400000000001
realizing these things but in ways i

5122.8 --> 5128.8
looked like a victim and he didn't even

5126.4 --> 5128.799999999999
know it

5129.199 --> 5133.678999999999
but there's just this thing like

5131.6 --> 5136.8
radiating off me like this

5133.679 --> 5137.36
innocence that was not controlled that

5136.8 --> 5140.56
wasn't

5137.36 --> 5142.88
realized and protected properly that i

5140.56 --> 5142.88
had

5145.36 --> 5149.04
and that also and that is part of the

5147.52 --> 5152.719
reason i think that

5149.04 --> 5155.92
yeah some people

5152.719 --> 5157.84
did like really

5155.92 --> 5162.0
how do you call that headed out for me

5157.84 --> 5165.1990000000005
just they they wanted to pick on me

5162.0 --> 5168.239
because i was radiating this unprotected

5165.199 --> 5171.5199999999995
unrealized innocence

5168.239 --> 5175.28
that it was a naivety that was just

5171.52 --> 5178.320000000001
radiating off me in ways like

5175.28 --> 5180.159
especially like in in the mid teens like

5178.32 --> 5183.199
when i was 17

5180.159 --> 5185.839999999999
radiated off me like crazy like i was

5183.199 --> 5188.879999999999
not able to deal with reality that just

5185.84 --> 5192.400000000001
radiated off me like nothing else

5188.88 --> 5192.400000000001
it was really bothering me

5194.0 --> 5198.88
and even like older photographs just

5197.12 --> 5200.8
show that to me i don't even know if

5198.88 --> 5205.12
other people can see it in it

5200.8 --> 5207.76
because i was also hiding it

5205.12 --> 5209.04
i can just see straight through it it's

5207.76 --> 5211.679
just like this

5209.04 --> 5213.84
thick layer of essence is on there for

5211.679 --> 5213.84
me

5213.92 --> 5217.12
anyway yeah i'm not gonna i'm not gonna

5216.48 --> 5219.759999999999
flick through

5217.12 --> 5222.08
all the photographs most of them aren't

5219.76 --> 5225.52
even digital anyway

5222.08 --> 5228.08
don't think i have that many

5225.52 --> 5229.52
well i do have a lot of my photographs

5228.08 --> 5232.32
from my youth but there are

5229.52 --> 5235.040000000001
all literally photographs in the box in

5232.32 --> 5235.04
my storage

5236.96 --> 5240.0
because digitized photos really only

5239.6 --> 5243.400000000001
came

5240.0 --> 5246.48
after is it

5243.4 --> 5248.719
2005 i first started to

5246.48 --> 5249.678999999999
2006 is when i first started to really

5248.719 --> 5251.28
do that

5249.679 --> 5252.8
and then it became easy to put your

5251.28 --> 5254.719
photographs on the computer

5252.8 --> 5256.400000000001
it probably was for some time but that's

5254.719 --> 5260.56
when i started to figure out

5256.4 --> 5267.839999999999
how to do that it was very late

5260.56 --> 5267.84
with technology

5270.639 --> 5281.84
hmm oh that is funny robin stanley

5274.48 --> 5281.839999999999
that's interesting

5283.04 --> 5289.199
i don't think anybody in my family has

5286.639 --> 5292.56
really dressed like this

5289.199 --> 5295.04
if they did then funnily enough

5292.56 --> 5297.04
it would be my grandfather that i've

5295.04 --> 5299.28
never personally met

5297.04 --> 5303.04
who was a freemason i think that he

5299.28 --> 5305.36
might always be wearing black

5303.04 --> 5309.84
this entire life but i'm not sure i've

5305.36 --> 5309.839999999999
never even seen photographs of him

5311.76 --> 5317.76
i might be completely wrong there i

5314.639 --> 5320.159000000001
don't know why i'm saying that even

5317.76 --> 5320.159000000001
i just

5321.52 --> 5324.719
maybe this is the first

5326.719 --> 5330.4800000000005
but in a way when i did kind of like

5329.12 --> 5333.5199999999995
wear colorful

5330.48 --> 5335.839999999999
more hippie clothing like things i

5333.52 --> 5337.120000000001
i looked a lot like my dad because my

5335.84 --> 5340.400000000001
dad's done that too

5337.12 --> 5340.4
and had the same

5340.8 --> 5347.76
naivety by the way radiating from him

5344.639 --> 5349.679
but he had a lot better defenses

5347.76 --> 5351.52
for society out there because he's been

5349.679 --> 5354.2390000000005
more socially communic

5351.52 --> 5355.120000000001
communicative than me and of course he's

5354.239 --> 5358.08
older than me

5355.12 --> 5358.08
longer experience

5359.92 --> 5367.84
but he's also had his colorful periods

5365.76 --> 5370.0
although as you think he typically

5367.84 --> 5371.76
favored different types of color schemes

5370.0 --> 5374.96
than i did

5371.76 --> 5378.08
i was more about blue and purple

5374.96 --> 5378.96
and he's always been more about most of

5378.08 --> 5382.0
the yeah about

5378.96 --> 5386.96
orange a wetness

5382.0 --> 5389.12
orange yellow oh yellow orange and green

5386.96 --> 5393.84
it's very weird how contrasting that is

5389.12 --> 5393.84
in ways

5396.239 --> 5407.759999999999
but he's he's not so colorful anymore

5399.6 --> 5420.96
he's more average modest

5407.76 --> 5423.12
nothing too spectacular

5420.96 --> 5424.08
oh that's very cool that you even have

5423.12 --> 5435.84
those photographs

5424.08 --> 5435.84
robin stanley that's nice

5475.12 --> 5483.28
what pack a bag of clothes to change

5478.48 --> 5483.28
really so like she had

5483.679 --> 5491.84
she had to kind of hide it from her from

5486.639 --> 5491.84
her parents or something

5502.84 --> 5505.84
huh

5510.8 --> 5513.1990000000005
right

5514.32 --> 5519.84
well my family was definitely not

5516.84 --> 5519.84
conservative

5525.199 --> 5529.839999999999
it's very very liberal

5530.719 --> 5536.2390000000005
and they let me do whatever i liked

5534.0 --> 5538.719
which was kind of unnerving because

5536.239 --> 5541.678999999999
sometimes i tried to challenge them

5538.719 --> 5543.199
it's like i would try to make them

5541.679 --> 5544.96
correct me because but

5543.199 --> 5546.5599999999995
because they were so liberal they

5544.96 --> 5549.92
thought that they needed to

5546.56 --> 5551.04
tolerate it that's some bad chemistry

5549.92 --> 5554.0
happening there

5551.04 --> 5554.0
i can tell you that

5554.4 --> 5557.92
you know because kids do that sometimes

5556.719 --> 5560.639
they try to force

5557.92 --> 5562.159
their parents's hands because they feel

5560.639 --> 5563.679
they have no more control

5562.159 --> 5565.759999999999
and they let something get out of

5563.679 --> 5567.76
control so that the parent steps in and

5565.76 --> 5570.159000000001
basically addresses what's going on it's

5567.76 --> 5572.639
like a cry for help when your parent

5570.159 --> 5574.638999999999
then just misinterprets that

5572.639 --> 5576.08
as like a sort of virtual signal

5574.639 --> 5578.639
situation

5576.08 --> 5579.84
then they don't correct you when they

5578.639 --> 5582.719
absolutely should

5579.84 --> 5584.8
and then you just get flustered or

5582.719 --> 5588.4
something is normalized to you

5584.8 --> 5589.12
that should not be right this is the

5588.4 --> 5591.28
typical

5589.12 --> 5593.04
problems with a lot of liberal families

5591.28 --> 5595.92
i think

5593.04 --> 5595.92
maybe i'm wrong

5596.32 --> 5603.84
it was a problem with me

5603.92 --> 5607.679
i don't know what it's like really to be

5606.0 --> 5609.84
in a conservative family because i've

5607.679 --> 5613.76
never had that experience

5609.84 --> 5615.84
not even close i was kind of frightened

5613.76 --> 5619.360000000001
of it

5615.84 --> 5621.6
other people that had that sort of life

5619.36 --> 5623.36
and then eventually i became jealous of

5621.6 --> 5625.1990000000005
it because man

5623.36 --> 5631.839999999999
all that discipline would have been so

5625.199 --> 5631.839999999999
much healthier for me

5668.8 --> 5687.84
huh okay that's that's

5672.159 --> 5687.839999999999
pretty cool robin

5691.81 --> 5695.579000000001
[Music]

5713.6 --> 5717.52
yes yeah here we go oh yeah you hit the

5716.639 --> 5720.0
nail on the

5717.52 --> 5721.1990000000005
or you hit the yeah nail on the head

5720.0 --> 5724.88
there

5721.199 --> 5726.96
discipline is great except if your

5724.88 --> 5729.28
parents are hypocrites

5726.96 --> 5730.2390000000005
that is terrible then it really burns

5729.28 --> 5733.36
you up

5730.239 --> 5736.4
i know what that's like well i know with

5733.36 --> 5737.5199999999995
in an indirect sense i think that my

5736.4 --> 5740.96
parents

5737.52 --> 5743.84
definitely did their utmost best to not

5740.96 --> 5743.84
be hypocrites

5744.239 --> 5748.638999999999
but sometimes they just didn't have a

5746.4 --> 5752.0
full grip on situations they didn't know

5748.639 --> 5752.0
really what they were dealing with

5755.119 --> 5758.799999999999
but that's a very good point discipline

5757.199 --> 5761.5199999999995
is great but

5758.8 --> 5763.52
like it has to start with the one that's

5761.52 --> 5765.4400000000005
upholding the discipline they have to

5763.52 --> 5767.280000000001
have that discipline for themselves too

5765.44 --> 5770.799999999999
because if they're hypocrites

5767.28 --> 5775.04
it's it's very yeah it

5770.8 --> 5778.400000000001
creates anguish in the one that they're

5775.04 --> 5781.5199999999995
disciplining or that they're

5778.4 --> 5784.239
helping to uphold discipline with

5781.52 --> 5784.96
they start to notice that yeah that when

5784.239 --> 5788.5599999999995
your parents

5784.96 --> 5788.56
are hypocrites that's terrible

5789.52 --> 5794.0
especially if they then deny it and all

5796.84 --> 5799.84
that

5832.719 --> 5837.76
you grew up that way huh

5836.07 --> 5841.84
[Music]

5837.76 --> 5841.84
that kinda sucks

5870.76 --> 5873.959
[Music]

5880.84 --> 5883.84
so

5884.0 --> 5889.119
sorry moving on now don't worry about it

5886.0 --> 5889.119
like i'm kind of like

5890.0 --> 5893.36
been rambling on a lot and so now i'm

5892.48 --> 5897.839999999999
kind of like

5893.36 --> 5897.839999999999
in a calm period yeah

5901.92 --> 5906.4800000000005
at some point out you kind of turn out

5908.48 --> 5925.839999999999
i'm not getting out of these words never

5910.48 --> 5925.839999999999
mind i'll be back in two minutes

5992.84 --> 5995.84
so

6006.84 --> 6009.84
you

6019.04 --> 6024.8
all right i'll see you later again

6022.08 --> 6024.8
here we go again

6033.04 --> 6051.84
enjoy the walk sounds nice

6059.92 --> 6067.92
right so i got 20 more minutes to go

6065.36 --> 6068.4
i'm up for pretty much anything i've

6067.92 --> 6071.04
maybe

6068.4 --> 6072.08
done with the introspective stuff it's

6071.04 --> 6076.08
been good

6072.08 --> 6077.84
i think i'll have to listen back to that

6076.08 --> 6079.28
to figure out whether that was good or

6077.84 --> 6082.32
just a lot of

6079.28 --> 6085.36
loose esoteric sketches

6082.32 --> 6088.48
i hope people got it

6085.36 --> 6091.599999999999
sometimes i really don't know whether

6088.48 --> 6094.159
what i'm saying if it actually makes

6091.6 --> 6095.4400000000005
sense to the same level that i think it

6094.159 --> 6098.879999999999
makes sense

6095.44 --> 6100.239
you know i'm not entirely sure every

6098.88 --> 6102.2390000000005
time

6100.239 --> 6104.239
because i do typically like in fractal

6102.239 --> 6106.48
fashion just try to figure things out

6104.239 --> 6109.44
and then i'm wondering like okay

6106.48 --> 6109.759999999999
i understood exactly what i was doing

6109.44 --> 6111.839999999999
but

6109.76 --> 6112.96
did other people understand that in the

6111.84 --> 6121.76
same way i'm not

6112.96 --> 6125.04
a hundred percent sure

6121.76 --> 6125.04
but i hope so at least

6131.28 --> 6135.84
weather is crap but you need the

6132.56 --> 6135.84
exercise oh well

6137.07 --> 6140.16
[Music]

6143.44 --> 6148.879999999999
oh man i hate exercise like that

6146.719 --> 6151.199
like the only reason i would ever

6148.88 --> 6154.8
exercise

6151.199 --> 6158.719
is because my girlfriend was exercising

6154.8 --> 6158.719
and then i would enjoy it probably

6160.719 --> 6166.56
but just me on my own i i don't know

6163.92 --> 6166.56
what it is

6167.6 --> 6170.719
it just feels weird

6173.679 --> 6177.84
and it always has like even when i was

6175.679 --> 6178.96
younger and a lot sleener and everything

6177.84 --> 6181.28
i would just be

6178.96 --> 6183.92
self-conscious in a not so good way i

6181.28 --> 6183.92
don't know why

6189.199 --> 6194.08
like when i'm like talking about jogging

6191.44 --> 6194.08
or something

6194.56 --> 6199.04
i always felt uncomfortable just being

6196.88 --> 6201.1990000000005
visible doing something like that on my

6199.04 --> 6201.199
own

6201.76 --> 6206.0
but yeah having a friend to do it with

6204.08 --> 6206.48
if you're actually like on a mission

6206.0 --> 6209.199
with it

6206.48 --> 6210.718999999999
like if you it can really grab you then

6209.199 --> 6213.599999999999
yeah that would be pretty cool but doing

6210.719 --> 6213.6
it on my own i

6214.48 --> 6219.839999999999
not my thing at all

6222.32 --> 6228.159
oh ice ice rinks what's a rink

6228.4 --> 6236.0
like a ramp or something for ice skating

6233.36 --> 6236.0
that's cool

6238.0 --> 6241.04
indoor right right

6241.44 --> 6247.839999999999
hey guns have never run rmp good to see

6244.84 --> 6247.84
you

6256.22 --> 6259.409000000001
[Music]

6260.56 --> 6265.1990000000005
oh did i already say hello to a man like

6262.88 --> 6266.96
me i think

6265.199 --> 6268.239
you just kind of slipped in there like

6266.96 --> 6274.96
you're always there

6268.239 --> 6277.199
hello to you

6274.96 --> 6278.32
how am i doing today guns of nephron

6277.199 --> 6280.638999999999
well

6278.32 --> 6284.08
i'm doing okay like the whole show has

6280.639 --> 6284.08
been very introspective

6284.4 --> 6289.759999999999
and reflecting upon my issues with

6287.199 --> 6294.159
social communication out there and just

6289.76 --> 6298.0
what do does my mind get caught up into

6294.159 --> 6298.0
the processes all the processes

6298.08 --> 6302.159
i've been very much focused on that this

6300.159 --> 6304.4
show it seems

6302.159 --> 6306.159
oh by the way the title doesn't have

6304.4 --> 6308.08
anything to directly do with that

6306.159 --> 6311.199
it's rather a reference the titles are

6308.08 --> 6311.199
reference to ballers

6311.28 --> 6314.639
we discussed i just came up with the

6313.199 --> 6317.599999999999
words like yeah they're intellectual

6314.639 --> 6319.6
nomads they

6317.6 --> 6322.159000000001
they keep on making arguments but as

6319.6 --> 6323.76
soon as it's

6322.159 --> 6325.199
when it's being countered they just

6323.76 --> 6327.280000000001
quickly move on

6325.199 --> 6329.28
to another argument so add it they're

6327.28 --> 6332.4
like intellectual nomads they

6329.28 --> 6334.48
they don't have any home base

6332.4 --> 6336.48
so you can keep driving them away but

6334.48 --> 6338.5599999999995
they'll always just move on to another

6336.48 --> 6342.08
ground

6338.56 --> 6342.080000000001
so intellectual nomads

6342.96 --> 6348.2390000000005
for the yeah just to clarify that

6346.159 --> 6350.0
but that's that's that was like five

6348.239 --> 6352.08
minutes at the beginning of the show

6350.0 --> 6353.119
so barely talked about that but it is

6352.08 --> 6359.84
the title

6353.119 --> 6359.839999999999
because i thought it was pretty good

6362.48 --> 6373.839999999999
hey how do you fight me

6390.08 --> 6393.5199999999995
all right yeah thank you for the comment

6392.32 --> 6396.239
that's

6393.52 --> 6396.2390000000005
that's a good one

6396.8 --> 6401.679
feeling trapped in a box helpless i've

6399.679 --> 6406.4
had problems with that in the past

6401.679 --> 6406.4
complacency gone unnoticed is very evil

6406.8 --> 6409.84
that's i don't know what that has to do

6409.119 --> 6413.119
with it

6409.84 --> 6416.400000000001
directly but it is a good point

6413.119 --> 6419.759999999999
uh also i found that we

6416.4 --> 6422.4
often will construct this cement wall

6419.76 --> 6424.96
right in front of you or in front of

6422.4 --> 6424.96
your face

6425.119 --> 6430.159
but the truth of the matter is that the

6426.8 --> 6430.159000000001
wall is often made of paper

6432.719 --> 6436.96
right well you can you can get through

6436.08 --> 6438.719
it once

6436.96 --> 6441.119
i that's why i rather see it as a

6438.719 --> 6443.199
threshold it's just a

6441.119 --> 6446.08
yeah a threshold you have to get over

6443.199 --> 6457.839999999999
but it can be like a wall

6446.08 --> 6457.84
if it feels like a wall

6460.88 --> 6464.08
earlier you mentioned you felt trapped

6462.639 --> 6465.76
and wanted to get out

6464.08 --> 6470.5599999999995
well that's the sensation that's the

6465.76 --> 6473.76
feeling it's like his dissatisfaction

6470.56 --> 6475.4400000000005
almost claustrophobia but it just has

6473.76 --> 6476.2390000000005
its moments and it's more like a

6475.44 --> 6479.28
background

6476.239 --> 6479.28
whining feeling

6479.6 --> 6484.4800000000005
but that's why i reflected so much on

6482.84 --> 6487.1990000000005
just

6484.48 --> 6487.199
what it's like

6488.639 --> 6491.76
and also just the consequences of

6490.88 --> 6496.84
getting to know

6491.76 --> 6498.96
people and my universal problem with

6496.84 --> 6502.639
people like

6498.96 --> 6502.639
they don't feel like me

6503.52 --> 6509.040000000001
and i'm seeking to bond specifically so

6507.119 --> 6512.799999999999
that it's just kind of like it

6509.04 --> 6516.0
it's a natural it's not even like fear

6512.8 --> 6518.4800000000005
it's just that i figure out i i don't

6516.0 --> 6520.639
really want to i'll probably be sorry

6518.48 --> 6522.5599999999995
that's really the sensation that arrives

6520.639 --> 6525.28
for me

6522.56 --> 6526.2390000000005
it's not that i'm afraid to it's just

6525.28 --> 6529.599999999999
that i don't

6526.239 --> 6530.159
realize i don't want to like a lot of

6529.6 --> 6535.1990000000005
people

6530.159 --> 6537.28
when yeah it sounds kind of pessimistic

6535.199 --> 6539.5199999999995
like it's better having that little

6537.28 --> 6541.36
distance because

6539.52 --> 6543.4400000000005
there will be more spirit to keep it

6541.36 --> 6544.0
going when you really get to know

6543.44 --> 6545.919999999999
somebody

6544.0 --> 6549.36
a lot of that breaks down and then you

6545.92 --> 6549.36
can't unsee it again

6550.719 --> 6555.36
and it's much tougher to deal with it

6553.04 --> 6558.4
afterward

6555.36 --> 6560.88
i think for me especially for other

6558.4 --> 6563.92
people towards me this is a big

6560.88 --> 6564.32
thing it's like i get the feeling a lot

6563.92 --> 6569.84
that

6564.32 --> 6569.84
once people really get to know me

6570.239 --> 6577.36
they're probably gonna be sorry

6574.159 --> 6583.839999999999
because not because of the good traits

6577.36 --> 6583.839999999999
but because of the bad traits

6588.4 --> 6592.32
um what are we talking about here guns

6590.32 --> 6595.759999999999
in their own rmp

6592.32 --> 6598.799999999999
but right but anyway

6595.76 --> 6602.08
to round that one conversation it's

6598.8 --> 6604.0
it's not up to me it's just i

6602.08 --> 6606.639
weigh heavily on the bad trades other

6604.0 --> 6608.239
people might size it up very differently

6606.639 --> 6610.96
or they might even

6608.239 --> 6612.159
know a very good way to deal with it who

6610.96 --> 6614.4
knows they've

6612.159 --> 6616.0
grown up with somebody that had a

6614.4 --> 6619.04
similar trait and they know

6616.0 --> 6621.199
exactly what to do so it might turn out

6619.04 --> 6624.4
completely the other way around

6621.199 --> 6627.119
you see and that's why

6624.4 --> 6628.5599999999995
i know all this it's just that the image

6627.119 --> 6630.639
is still there

6628.56 --> 6632.88
that's my perspective and then there is

6630.639 --> 6634.719
the potential of what it could really be

6632.88 --> 6637.36
out there

6634.719 --> 6638.0
so that's like this quantum situation

6637.36 --> 6643.04
you don't really

6638.0 --> 6643.04
know what's gonna happen and i

6650.0 --> 6658.239
the best way for me

6653.76 --> 6658.2390000000005
to actually engage is to not care

6659.04 --> 6662.639
the problem though is that if i don't

6661.599 --> 6664.8
care

6662.639 --> 6666.400000000001
it's very specific type of care the

6664.8 --> 6669.4400000000005
nervous scare they care for

6666.4 --> 6672.638999999999
what will enroll of it if i care less

6669.44 --> 6674.719
then unfortunately my ego will also tend

6672.639 --> 6679.52
to latch on more

6674.719 --> 6679.52
and actually then yeah

6679.76 --> 6683.92
make the connections that i make

6684.32 --> 6691.759999999999
less valuable or distract me from it

6687.76 --> 6691.76
it's difficult like that

6693.119 --> 6700.32
but the best way the best moments when i

6696.08 --> 6700.32
get to know people is when i don't care

6700.48 --> 6707.759999999999
it's like no i don't care

6704.4 --> 6711.04
and just be me be almost blank

6707.76 --> 6713.679
and people will love it

6711.04 --> 6714.159
it happens every time when i don't care

6713.679 --> 6717.679
people

6714.159 --> 6723.36
love me this is

6717.679 --> 6725.1990000000005
how [ __ ] ironic is that

6723.36 --> 6727.44
i don't know why maybe because they can

6725.199 --> 6728.08
then project something onto me or they

6727.44 --> 6732.08
can just

6728.08 --> 6735.44
look over how amazing i am and whatever

6732.08 --> 6738.4
but that's why

6735.44 --> 6739.759999999999
that's why i said that thing about the

6738.4 --> 6751.839999999999
cremation okay i

6739.76 --> 6751.84
keep on bringing that one back

6754.88 --> 6758.56
right so because when you care about

6757.52 --> 6761.280000000001
something really

6758.56 --> 6762.320000000001
actively then if somebody else also

6761.28 --> 6765.36
cares about that

6762.32 --> 6766.08
then they feel united with you but when

6765.36 --> 6769.199
they don't

6766.08 --> 6771.92
know you and they don't care about that

6769.199 --> 6774.719
thing you care about

6771.92 --> 6775.52
it's just annoying and in the way so

6774.719 --> 6779.199
that's why

6775.52 --> 6781.52
if i don't care is ideal

6779.199 --> 6783.759999999999
for me to meet new people see how that

6781.52 --> 6786.96
works out mechanically

6783.76 --> 6790.320000000001
if i don't care then people can just

6786.96 --> 6793.04
roll in and get to know me and not

6790.32 --> 6793.759999999999
bump off something very specific that

6793.04 --> 6797.28
they're very

6793.76 --> 6800.96
unlikely to also have a passion about

6797.28 --> 6804.88
see and that's why i don't

6800.96 --> 6806.0
want to care my problem is not that i

6804.88 --> 6809.04
don't care and my problem

6806.0 --> 6809.599
is is that i can't let go of it a lot of

6809.04 --> 6813.04
the time

6809.599 --> 6814.0
i keep stuck to it in a way it's a form

6813.04 --> 6818.08
of savonia

6814.0 --> 6822.08
syndrome latching onto the

6818.08 --> 6825.199
onto the jewel too much onto the

6822.08 --> 6828.239
instead of just being just being just

6825.199 --> 6831.839999999999
being random and blank

6828.239 --> 6831.839999999999
and not be so specific

6832.84 --> 6835.84
right

6837.84 --> 6843.28
oh good mornings going because sometimes

6840.48 --> 6849.839999999999
i don't have a motivation to get moving

6843.28 --> 6849.84
old bones don't work too well hmm

6850.239 --> 6855.199
okay you found me an fed well i'm really

6853.679 --> 6858.4800000000005
glad you enjoyed i

6855.199 --> 6861.44
it sounds pretty cool that i have that

6858.48 --> 6863.28
that i do motivate you like that i i'm

6861.44 --> 6866.48
very honored

6863.28 --> 6866.96
or honored i'm happy about that that's

6866.48 --> 6870.638999999999
great

6866.96 --> 6873.199
i'm glad i motivate you can be tough

6870.639 --> 6873.1990000000005
sometimes

6873.92 --> 6877.1990000000005
thank you very much for that because

6875.28 --> 6879.28
i've never run rmp i really appreciate

6877.199 --> 6879.28
it

6884.48 --> 6890.159
and sometimes i i too need other people

6887.599 --> 6891.76
to basically drag me out of out of the

6890.159 --> 6894.08
mud a little

6891.76 --> 6895.4400000000005
like the guys i've read fed flat earth

6894.08 --> 6898.719
debate do that

6895.44 --> 6900.799999999999
regularly when i feel kind of like

6898.719 --> 6903.199
like intellectually i feel like i've

6900.8 --> 6906.56
have a melting molten brain

6903.199 --> 6908.799999999999
you know and then they just bring up the

6906.56 --> 6910.56
quality and then it just like wakes me

6908.8 --> 6913.92
up

6910.56 --> 6913.92
i really appreciate that

6914.719 --> 6918.4800000000005
so i'm glad i have the same influence on

6916.88 --> 6921.04

6918.48 --> 6921.04

6922.4 --> 6926.4
