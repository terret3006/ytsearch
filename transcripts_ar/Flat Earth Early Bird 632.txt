94.479 --> 98.88
different although it's still

97.04 --> 101.68
it's still warm enough but it's been

98.88 --> 106.399
like cloudy it's very moist

101.68 --> 110.399
and it's been raining most of the night

106.399 --> 110.399
so i actually put my uh

111.28 --> 115.68
like i got

116.44 --> 122.15899999999999
[Music]

118.88 --> 124.64
basically put

122.159 --> 127.60000000000001
put my bed back into the sheets because

124.64 --> 130.8
yeah it was kind of fresh

127.6 --> 134.07999999999998
uh i also went late

130.8 --> 135.04000000000002
went to bed late so cut up like an 11

134.08 --> 136.959
o'clock

135.04 --> 138.48
i guess it's because of the lack of heat

136.959 --> 141.76
that it just slept

138.48 --> 144.0
really nicely in the morning

141.76 --> 145.04
but it also made it pretty late it got

144.0 --> 148.239
like a whole

145.04 --> 152.319
thing full of notes it's

148.239 --> 152.31900000000002
very very active yesterday

154.84 --> 159.36
so

156.4 --> 159.68
that let's go through chat and yeah i

159.36 --> 162.64000000000001
just

159.68 --> 166.0
this is all i got today the lemonade i

162.64 --> 166.0
didn't take too much yesterday

168.84 --> 172.16
ah

170.5 --> 175.76
[Music]

172.16 --> 179.84
oh man also i

175.76 --> 180.879
today i cut my pants those annoying

179.84 --> 184.08
annoying

180.879 --> 185.84
shorts so so the half shorts i cut them

184.08 --> 187.92000000000002
down

185.84 --> 189.20000000000002
and i should have just instantly done

187.92 --> 191.11999999999998
that because now

189.2 --> 193.11999999999998
it suddenly has become pants that are

191.12 --> 193.68
just wearable and not annoying the [ __ ]

193.12 --> 197.12
out of me

193.68 --> 201.12
so yeah i still still

197.12 --> 205.92000000000002
should go to the clothes repair

201.12 --> 205.92000000000002
shop to kind of like turn that properly

207.76 --> 213.35999999999999
i need to fold it because it's going to

210.239 --> 217.28
unravel over time but at least now

213.36 --> 217.28
these things are just proper shorts

218.239 --> 223.519
because before they were always just

220.64 --> 225.51899999999998
like pulling on my knees and literally

223.519 --> 226.959
because of the way the fabric is and

225.519 --> 229.12
because it's pretty tight

226.959 --> 230.159
it just kept pulling the freaking pants

229.12 --> 233.28
off my ass

230.159 --> 235.84
so annoying [ __ ] literally

233.28 --> 237.36
cursing at these pants but so i just put

235.84 --> 240.799
the scissors in them and just

237.36 --> 242.64000000000001
cut it off and immediately it's so much

240.799 --> 246.0
better

242.64 --> 248.64
so anyway let's go through chat

246.0 --> 250.159
uh good servant was first matthew

248.64 --> 254.23899999999998
mitchells michael o'rourke

250.159 --> 257.28
glashaw tom parker dank

254.239 --> 259.519
yeah good to see you all hope soon more

257.28 --> 261.919
will follow

259.519 --> 262.88
uh so yeah yesterday after the flat

261.919 --> 265.28
earth debate

262.88 --> 266.8
uh i mean after the flat earth early

265.28 --> 269.59999999999997
bird

266.8 --> 271.52000000000004
which was a pretty decent show i thought

269.6 --> 276.08000000000004
thoughts on millie weaver yeah yeah

271.52 --> 276.08
sure i'll get there uh

277.84 --> 282.479
anyway i write pretty much shortly after

280.16 --> 288.47900000000004
the flat earth early bird i went on to

282.479 --> 291.68
24 7 flatter discord a good conversation

288.479 --> 294.4
uh yeah about about all kinds of things

291.68 --> 295.52
there was a new flat earth guy in there

294.4 --> 298.88
just had a

295.52 --> 300.88
nice long talk was crowded and we talked

298.88 --> 302.71999999999997
about gravity for a bit

300.88 --> 304.4
yeah and then i gave a nice metaphor

302.72 --> 305.36
that i made a note of i thought it was

304.4 --> 309.039
kind of funny

305.36 --> 312.40000000000003
like gravity within the

309.039 --> 316.88
the heliocentric religion is like

312.4 --> 320.71999999999997
is like glue that never dries

316.88 --> 322.88
because they stick it as a foundation in

320.72 --> 324.32000000000005
almost anything but it's like glue that

322.88 --> 327.84
never dries because

324.32 --> 331.12
it sort of sticks but it never

327.84 --> 333.67999999999995
it never really yeah

331.12 --> 334.56
dries up it never solidifies so it's

333.68 --> 337.36
like it just

334.56 --> 340.479
seems like it's gluing things together

337.36 --> 344.0
but in reality with just the

340.479 --> 347.59999999999997
with just time it'll fall apart

344.0 --> 347.6
or if you just pull on it

351.44 --> 355.36
yeah then after that i went to big bear

354.32 --> 359.199
who was live again

355.36 --> 361.6
it was hilarious oh that video

359.199 --> 364.0
from little torch did anyone see that

361.6 --> 367.36
holy [ __ ]

364.0 --> 369.68
that was so amazing i gotta find it i

367.36 --> 372.24
gotta find it little torch i gotta

369.68 --> 373.039
i didn't like look it up on youtube

372.24 --> 374.8
where it was

373.039 --> 377.759
he just played it like three or four

374.8 --> 380.24
times but god that was so awesome

377.759 --> 382.639
also big bear had a lot to say about the

380.24 --> 384.0
whole mega corporation situations and

382.639 --> 386.88
how they all

384.0 --> 388.56
have like virtue signaled with the

386.88 --> 392.56
rainbow

388.56 --> 395.88
situation which is basically like lgbtp

392.56 --> 398.639
and all that crap marxist

395.88 --> 400.639
anti-cultural movement and then i

398.639 --> 403.759
concluded like yeah rainbow you know

400.639 --> 404.56
rainbows why do they use rainbows you

403.759 --> 406.639
know

404.56 --> 408.639
and then i this thought entered me and

406.639 --> 412.72
it's so simple

408.639 --> 416.0
and it's so revealing rainbows

412.72 --> 416.0
are broken light

418.0 --> 422.319
how do you get a rainbow with a prism

420.24 --> 425.68
what does prism do it

422.319 --> 425.68
breaks light

426.96 --> 431.52
you know there's another there's

429.759 --> 435.28000000000003
metaphorical implications

431.52 --> 439.44
to light suddenly the rainbow as

435.28 --> 441.44
a it's like a symbol

439.44 --> 443.759
makes a lot more sense that way wouldn't

441.44 --> 443.759
you say

444.56 --> 452.08
it's not just oh all the colors

447.68 --> 456.24
sorrow one of many colors no no

452.08 --> 456.24
it's broken light

456.639 --> 460.0
so it is just like white light it's

459.52 --> 465.35999999999996
light

460.0 --> 467.599
except it's broken

465.36 --> 467.599
right

468.879 --> 472.319
so simple it just i just plucked it just

472.0 --> 476.16
like

472.319 --> 478.24
wait rainbows prisms

476.16 --> 480.92
what is that what is that process yeah

478.24 --> 483.44
it's the breaking apart of light

480.92 --> 487.44
[Music]

483.44 --> 490.84
so yeah suddenly this rainbow symbolism

487.44 --> 493.84
makes a lot more sense would you say

490.84 --> 493.84
um

495.84 --> 500.79999999999995
right so uh anyway uh

501.919 --> 508.56
got so busy yeah i had a nice long uh

506.0 --> 510.639
wait was it long i'm not sure i had a

508.56 --> 513.36
conversation with rust ahead

510.639 --> 516.64
over skype he updated me some and yeah

513.36 --> 516.64
he's getting bothered by

517.76 --> 521.8389999999999
my other situations over there it's like

520.399 --> 524.72
yeah

521.839 --> 526.5600000000001
he basically put out that the government

524.72 --> 531.44
there had been trying to pull

526.56 --> 531.4399999999999
like false flags even like arsony

531.839 --> 538.8800000000001
and they got caught like firemen

535.76 --> 543.12
me started fires and they were caught

538.88 --> 546.399
on camera and identified as firemen

543.12 --> 547.279
and then they yeah they they just

546.399 --> 549.839
ignored that

547.279 --> 551.519
it's a pretty wild situation at this

549.839 --> 553.839
town

551.519 --> 555.839
yeah california's going crazy especially

553.839 --> 559.839
in his town the rest of heads down

555.839 --> 562.08
so right well then

559.839 --> 563.36
of course yeah thunderstorm while rasta

562.08 --> 566.08
was calling there was

563.36 --> 568.0
such a massive massive thunderstorm that

566.08 --> 571.839
the thunder

568.0 --> 575.12
it just kept on rolling and rolling

571.839 --> 575.6
i think for at least half an hour

575.12 --> 578.64
straight

575.6 --> 580.9590000000001
there was no second within half an hour

578.64 --> 583.6
when there was no thunder rolling was

580.959 --> 584.959
that heavy

583.6 --> 586.8000000000001
although it seemed like most of the

584.959 --> 587.1999999999999
lightning strikes kind of stayed up

586.8 --> 588.959
there

587.2 --> 591.839
really high didn't see a lot of

588.959 --> 591.8389999999999
touchdowns

597.519 --> 602.839
god's rainbow

600.56 --> 605.8389999999999
no no you didn't listen to what i just

602.839 --> 605.839
said

606.0 --> 613.44
rainbow is broken light

609.519 --> 613.44
it's a hint did you

615.6 --> 623.519
there was never a rainbow flag

619.36 --> 627.04
before the the this whole thing

623.519 --> 628.33
you know historically didn't exist

627.04 --> 630.959
so

628.33 --> 634.8000000000001
[Music]

630.959 --> 637.4399999999999
right also i visited bible literalists

634.8 --> 638.7199999999999
hangout which was really late but it was

637.44 --> 641.6800000000001
good to be there and

638.72 --> 643.0400000000001
back and forth she went on about

641.68 --> 647.8389999999999
calvinists

643.04 --> 649.8389999999999
and about yeah the philosophizing

647.839 --> 651.2790000000001
and reference of biblical references and

649.839 --> 655.0400000000001
decisions

651.279 --> 657.4399999999999
through calvinists concerning the

655.04 --> 658.24
the the choice the free will how that

657.44 --> 661.44
works out

658.24 --> 662.8
very very detailed hangout about that i

661.44 --> 664.0790000000001
really appreciate it was very

662.8 --> 668.56
enlightening

664.079 --> 668.56
so bible literalist yeah

668.64 --> 671.68
she's just created that kind of stuff

670.399 --> 675.279
she's such an

671.68 --> 676.0
elaborately researched yeah bible

675.279 --> 679.12
literally

676.0 --> 681.6
annexed a terrorist at it but she does

679.12 --> 683.36
yeah she really abides by the spirit

681.6 --> 686.839
despite that focus and i

683.36 --> 689.839
really appreciate her input every time

686.839 --> 689.839
uh

689.92 --> 695.8389999999999
yeah also watch alex jones really late

693.36 --> 698.9590000000001
the late show which is for me starts

695.839 --> 698.9590000000001
after 11 p.m

699.04 --> 704.7199999999999
and yeah more report about about the

701.839 --> 707.6800000000001
millie weaver situation indeed like dank

704.72 --> 708.0
you said and he really put it out there

707.68 --> 712.0
like

708.0 --> 715.04
apparently he didn't even stream

712.0 --> 716.8
the movie shadowgate he i thought he

715.04 --> 720.0
might have but he didn't even said like

716.8 --> 721.04
i didn't and it seemed like this whole

720.0 --> 723.44
situation

721.04 --> 725.12
happened kind of unexpectedly like

723.44 --> 728.0
millie weaver got

725.12 --> 729.44
arrested for what seems to be like a

728.0 --> 733.2
really overblown

729.44 --> 735.519
family situation like she got in a fight

733.2 --> 736.0790000000001
with her mother or something and broke a

735.519 --> 738.9590000000001
phone

736.079 --> 740.399
and then mother reported that and then

738.959 --> 744.0
suddenly

740.399 --> 746.32
it was turned from stealing to a robbery

744.0 --> 748.0
and all kinds of crazy things are going

746.32 --> 750.8000000000001
on

748.0 --> 752.959
and i don't know if i don't know what

750.8 --> 754.639
this is i think this is

752.959 --> 756.88
something that's just a little thingy

754.639 --> 760.32
that was real

756.88 --> 761.92
and then like the deep staters the cia

760.32 --> 763.839
workers for the deep state or whatever

761.92 --> 765.12
the fbi i don't know how that exactly

763.839 --> 767.9200000000001
works but that

765.12 --> 770.16
people with that that mindset and those

767.92 --> 773.279
priorities they basically

770.16 --> 775.12
probably tricked her mother or something

773.279 --> 776.639
i don't know maybe even blackmail there

775.12 --> 780.32
i don't know how that works

776.639 --> 781.36
or what happened exactly in order to

780.32 --> 784.0
basically

781.36 --> 787.76
take that thing and just weaponize it to

784.0 --> 789.68
the maximum

787.76 --> 791.4399999999999
it's a really odd situation i don't

789.68 --> 794.4799999999999
think it is

791.44 --> 797.519
like a stunt although

794.48 --> 800.0790000000001
yeah effectively it is yeah

797.519 --> 804.0
even for me you know i i knew about

800.079 --> 806.8
shadowgate i heard some things about it

804.0 --> 808.639
but i just thought like oh yeah another

806.8 --> 810.4799999999999
one of those movies you know and

808.639 --> 813.36
so it's probably going to be pretty

810.48 --> 816.8000000000001
decent a lot of those things

813.36 --> 819.76
through infowars are pretty decent

816.8 --> 822.0
yeah a bit dry very specific to yeah

819.76 --> 824.16
politics often and

822.0 --> 826.88
and then this situation happened and

824.16 --> 830.48
that really caught my attention

826.88 --> 834.0
so i don't think she

830.48 --> 836.399
organized it on her own

834.0 --> 838.959
to be a stunt but it has become

836.399 --> 841.839
effectively a stunt

838.959 --> 844.8
nonetheless because i think she got a

841.839 --> 847.6800000000001
lot of attention because of this

844.8 --> 848.3199999999999
and shadowgate which she pretty much

847.68 --> 852.0
released

848.32 --> 852.0
right after that when that happened

852.24 --> 855.92
like her mother was on the infowars shed

854.24 --> 859.12
she didn't he hadn't even mirrored the

855.92 --> 863.279
movie yet on her own site

859.12 --> 863.279
anyway that those are my thoughts about

868.839 --> 872.24
it

870.0 --> 875.6
yeah it did remind me a lot about the

872.24 --> 875.6
roger stone situation

875.76 --> 880.079
which yeah was kind of similar very

877.92 --> 882.8
overblown very harsh

880.079 --> 885.68
judgments and all that crazy out of

882.8 --> 887.68
whack situation

885.68 --> 890.16
oh yeah and alex also said that he was

887.68 --> 893.3599999999999
kind of reluctant to

890.16 --> 895.199
even present the movie because somebody

893.36 --> 898.8000000000001
in there apparently said that

895.199 --> 900.639
roger stone was at

898.8 --> 903.04
basically the head of the deep state or

900.639 --> 903.04
something

904.079 --> 909.519
not literally like that but something

907.04 --> 911.199
often weird and that's why he had some

909.519 --> 912.0
doubts about the whole situation anyway

911.199 --> 914.399
yeah yesterday

912.0 --> 916.72
was quite elite the sunday show he

914.399 --> 918.639
talked about that very elaborately and

916.72 --> 922.32
it was interesting that's why i

918.639 --> 922.32
basically listened to the whole thing

922.8 --> 930.0
from 11 to 1 o'clock

927.77 --> 932.3199999999999
[Music]

930.0 --> 934.72
what did i do after that i don't

932.32 --> 934.72
remember

935.92 --> 942.959
what's that oh yeah i went on 24 7

940.72 --> 946.0
discord a second time

942.959 --> 951.279
yeah till pretty late so

946.0 --> 951.279
i've been busy busy all day yesterday

951.839 --> 958.0790000000001
and overall yeah those two extra hours

955.36 --> 961.519
on 24 7 discord they were very good

958.079 --> 961.519
i don't know if anybody caught that

967.36 --> 972.88
anyway uh today i didn't do didn't watch

970.16 --> 972.88
anything really

972.959 --> 978.0
just got up played my game did some

975.759 --> 982.16
groceries oh yeah rasta called again

978.0 --> 983.759
to give me another update not too long

982.16 --> 986.079
because then i went for groceries then i

983.759 --> 989.1990000000001
got back

986.079 --> 994.4799999999999
uh cut my pants

989.199 --> 994.4799999999999
short had some lunch

995.199 --> 999.3599999999999
another illuminati warmed up illuminati

997.759 --> 1002.0
crystal

999.36 --> 1003.36
and then i started the show after having

1002.0 --> 1010.72
it smoke

1003.36 --> 1015.6800000000001
so yeah there we are

1010.72 --> 1015.6800000000001
a george sanford

1016.639 --> 1019.6
nice white shirt

1023.279 --> 1026.319
purple rockstar

1028.319 --> 1033.28
getting all active matthew mitchell

1036.839 --> 1039.839
uh

1039.919 --> 1042.88
so yeah we got another half hour and

1041.6 --> 1043.52
then the flight of debates are going to

1042.88 --> 1045.2800000000002
stop a

1043.52 --> 1047.9189999999999
startup i'm going to join that so

1045.28 --> 1047.9189999999999
anything else

1048.079 --> 1054.559
guys wanted to discuss

1051.6 --> 1055.12
besides food let's not do that yesterday

1054.559 --> 1067.84
was

1055.12 --> 1067.84
pretty much big chunk of food episode

1073.78 --> 1077.22
[Music]

1078.4 --> 1086.5590000000002
oh yeah i remember yeah

1082.32 --> 1089.6789999999999
chocolate posted this video

1086.559 --> 1091.84
he found on facebook of this

1089.679 --> 1092.96
what is it that the head spokesperson of

1091.84 --> 1096.72
nasa currently

1092.96 --> 1099.679
it's this woman in that video man

1096.72 --> 1099.679
holy [ __ ]

1104.08 --> 1108.0
i kind of want to i want to play a part

1106.16 --> 1110.96
of it i should be able to do that i

1108.0 --> 1115.2
think without getting a copyright strike

1110.96 --> 1115.2
just part of it it's pretty amazing

1116.69 --> 1119.789
[Music]

1120.4 --> 1126.64
hold on

1123.6 --> 1126.6399999999999
where did i put that

1132.16 --> 1138.72
oh wait yeah chocolate

1135.28 --> 1138.72
reposted it i think

1141.44 --> 1151.8400000000001
ah there you go

1191.2 --> 1193.8400000000001
oh

1208.48 --> 1211.679
you know come along and see what we're

1209.84 --> 1213.12
learning and see how it changes your

1211.679 --> 1215.52
life

1213.12 --> 1217.039
and i mean that your life will be

1215.52 --> 1217.6
changed when you learn the things that

1217.039 --> 1221.84
we know

1217.6 --> 1221.84
for the better

1222.08 --> 1226.08
it's not okay to think that the earth is

1224.559 --> 1228.76
flat apparently this is something that

1226.08 --> 1232.08
we're debating i have no idea why

1228.76 --> 1233.6
[Music]

1232.08 --> 1235.1999999999998
you know i'm one of these people that

1233.6 --> 1236.8799999999999
doesn't like to identify as a specific

1235.2 --> 1239.679
specific gender even you know i mean i

1236.88 --> 1241.679
can deal with human

1239.679 --> 1243.679
i'm i'm one of these people that doesn't

1241.679 --> 1246.4
like to identify as a specific

1243.679 --> 1247.2
specific gender you know i mean i can

1246.4 --> 1249.8400000000001
deal with

1247.2 --> 1249.8400000000001
human

1251.36 --> 1254.3999999999999
and so you have this one tiny little

1253.52 --> 1255.76
chance

1254.4 --> 1257.679
to have the universe look through your

1255.76 --> 1259.2
eyes and

1257.679 --> 1261.039
and what are you going to do with that

1259.2 --> 1263.8400000000001
chance and what i do i

1261.039 --> 1266.95
i i connect to people too hard i have

1263.84 --> 1269.6
sex with all the wrong people

1266.95 --> 1271.8400000000001
[Music]

1269.6 --> 1273.039
ignorant slot it's not okay to say that

1271.84 --> 1275.9189999999999
the earth is flat

1273.039 --> 1277.12
keep getting this question there's no

1275.919 --> 1278.72
such thing as as

1277.12 --> 1280.8799999999999
life really that we're we're very

1278.72 --> 1282.4
complicated rocks

1280.88 --> 1284.7990000000002
we're a chemical reaction that got

1282.4 --> 1288.0800000000002
complex enough to become conscious

1284.799 --> 1288.48
there's no such thing as as life really

1288.08 --> 1292.24
that

1288.48 --> 1294.4
we're very complicated rocks

1292.24 --> 1296.0
we're a chemical reaction that got

1294.4 --> 1299.039
complex enough to become

1296.0 --> 1300.559
conscious so i am saying actually that

1299.039 --> 1304.8799999999999
there are probably tiny little black

1300.559 --> 1307.44
holes forming all around us

1304.88 --> 1309.8400000000001
oh i've heard that one before but so the

1307.44 --> 1311.2
idea that we were all just hydrogen 13

1309.84 --> 1313.76
billion years ago

1311.2 --> 1314.48
we can take a picture of that that's not

1313.76 --> 1317.36
a theory

1314.48 --> 1318.32
right we can take a picture of that

1317.36 --> 1322.1589999999999
that's

1318.32 --> 1323.28
not a theory i often run into scientists

1322.159 --> 1325.49
that really resist

1323.28 --> 1328.0
science communicators like me

1325.49 --> 1330.88
[Music]

1328.0 --> 1332.48
my main job now is communicating science

1330.88 --> 1333.5200000000002
but i can't read a scientific paper to

1332.48 --> 1334.88
save my life

1333.52 --> 1337.84
there's no such real thing as a

1334.88 --> 1337.8400000000001
scientific method

1338.799 --> 1341.84
yeah there is the last thing you will

1340.48 --> 1344.4
see is the very

1341.84 --> 1346.08
top of the mast of that boat and that's

1344.4 --> 1347.2
because the boat is actually going over

1346.08 --> 1348.75
the horizon

1347.2 --> 1352.64
that's curved

1348.75 --> 1354.48
[Music]

1352.64 --> 1358.159
it's not okay to say that the earth is

1354.48 --> 1358.159
flat keep getting this question

1358.799 --> 1361.84
i mean today i'm going to be talking

1360.08 --> 1363.4399999999998
about how every single one of your atoms

1361.84 --> 1365.28
was forged inside a star

1363.44 --> 1367.52
that had to die and that's literally

1365.28 --> 1367.52
true

1369.28 --> 1373.2
but you have light years contained

1371.44 --> 1374.72
inside of you except for your hydrogen

1373.2 --> 1376.77
which came from the big bang which is

1374.72 --> 1378.559
that that doesn't suck look at the guy

1376.77 --> 1382.799
[Music]

1378.559 --> 1385.36
where you have light years contained

1382.799 --> 1387.36
except for your hydrogen which came from

1385.36 --> 1388.8799999999999
the big bang

1387.36 --> 1392.1589999999999
i have never felt comfortable

1388.88 --> 1392.159
professionally or personally

1394.24 --> 1397.76
space is very hot the gas right around

1396.559 --> 1402.24
the earth is actually millions of

1397.76 --> 1404.24
degrees hot that's actually true this is

1402.24 --> 1407.2
a real picture from hubble

1404.24 --> 1409.44
you and i have the same chemistry as one

1407.2 --> 1412.0
of these dust clouds compressed together

1409.44 --> 1417.3600000000001
that's what we are you know we are from

1412.0 --> 1420.0
one of these collapsing clouds of dust

1417.36 --> 1421.76
on any given date at different cities

1420.0 --> 1423.12
and different places around the world

1421.76 --> 1424.8799999999999
the sun is at different angles in the

1423.12 --> 1427.3
sky that wouldn't happen

1424.88 --> 1429.44
if the earth wasn't round

1427.3 --> 1431.279
[Music]

1429.44 --> 1433.2
it's not okay to say that the earth is

1431.279 --> 1434.88
flat

1433.2 --> 1437.919
well let's have more people that are not

1434.88 --> 1439.7600000000002
just older white men in science

1437.919 --> 1441.039
so that's one of my big passions is

1439.76 --> 1443.44
getting people to

1441.039 --> 1446.32
to shake loose science from our cultural

1443.44 --> 1446.3200000000002
definitions of it

1446.559 --> 1453.36
my main job now is communicating science

1449.919 --> 1459.8400000000001
you literally can touch the stars just

1453.36 --> 1459.84
just by doing it

1461.36 --> 1465.12
heaven is not a place heaven is not a

1464.159 --> 1468.0800000000002
place

1465.12 --> 1469.6
this is something that we know [ __ ]

1469.6 --> 1477.6789999999999
to me science is going to die

gentlemen we proudly add the name dr

1477.679 --> 1484.3200000000002
michelle to our space camp

1480.96 --> 1486.4
hall of fame i fall in love with

1484.32 --> 1488.24
everybody all the time

1486.4 --> 1489.8400000000001
that's what being a scientist is to me

1488.24 --> 1491.36
thank you

1489.84 --> 1493.52
it looks like the type of disorder

1491.36 --> 1494.32
that's rarely ever seen anymore except

1493.52 --> 1496.559
in

1494.32 --> 1498.32
primitive cultures so i don't really

1496.559 --> 1500.24
know what's going on right now with this

1498.32 --> 1502.72
earthis flat thing

1500.24 --> 1504.4
and it's not okay to think that the

1502.72 --> 1506.559
earth is flat

1504.4 --> 1508.64
if you want to think the world is flat

1506.559 --> 1511.12
go right ahead

1508.64 --> 1512.3200000000002
and it's not okay to think that the

1511.12 --> 1515.1999999999998
earth is flat

1512.32 --> 1517.2
go right ahead that's a hard thing for

1515.2 --> 1519.44
me to even start talking about because

1517.2 --> 1520.32
there are so many proofs that the earth

1519.44 --> 1522.799
is round

1520.32 --> 1523.76
it's difficult to know where to start go

1522.799 --> 1526.4
right ahead

1523.76 --> 1527.039
is to think about you can and should

1526.4 --> 1529.1200000000001
think

1527.039 --> 1530.96
now another way that you can tell that

1529.12 --> 1533.52
we're on a sphere

1530.96 --> 1535.76
is to think about you can and should

1533.52 --> 1535.76
think

1536.0 --> 1539.6
whatever you want how there's something

1538.4 --> 1541.76
called the tropics

1539.6 --> 1543.6789999999999
on the earth and the tropics are the

1541.76 --> 1545.44
places near the equator of the earth

1543.679 --> 1548.159
where sometimes the sun is overhead in

1545.44 --> 1549.6000000000001
the sky and this was actually something

1548.159 --> 1551.919
that the greeks used

1549.6 --> 1554.0
not only to prove that the earth was

1551.919 --> 1555.679
round about 2000 years ago

1554.0 --> 1557.2
but they actually measured the

1555.679 --> 1559.52
circumference of the earth

1557.2 --> 1560.88
accurate within just a couple percent

1559.52 --> 1563.36
two thousand years ago

1560.88 --> 1564.64
we've known that the earth was round

1563.36 --> 1567.6789999999999
that the earth was around

1564.64 --> 1569.2
about two thousand years ago two

1567.679 --> 1571.279
thousand years ago we've known that the

1569.2 --> 1573.1200000000001
earth was round

1571.279 --> 1575.36
that the earth was round about two

1573.12 --> 1578.6399999999999
thousand years ago

1575.36 --> 1582.08
two thousand years ago

1578.64 --> 1582.0800000000002
we've known that the earth was round

1582.48 --> 1588.08
two 000 years ago

1585.679 --> 1590.24
and he rationed that that change in

1588.08 --> 1592.48
angle from one city to another

1590.24 --> 1593.679
was probably indicative of us being on a

1592.48 --> 1595.919
curved surface

1593.679 --> 1597.52
you see this curvature of earth's

1595.919 --> 1599.679
surface and he's like wow

1597.52 --> 1601.44
he's in space look at that and you could

1599.679 --> 1602.96
make all kinds of measurements even

1601.44 --> 1604.48
between those two cities

1602.96 --> 1605.919
and see that the angles were different

1604.48 --> 1606.72
the sun was in a different place in the

1605.919 --> 1608.5590000000002
sky

1606.72 --> 1610.32
using this he actually measured the

1608.559 --> 1611.12
circumference of the earth and he got it

1610.32 --> 1614.1589999999999
right

1611.12 --> 1615.6
thousand years ago no he's not that the

1614.159 --> 1618.48
earth was round about

1615.6 --> 1619.039
two thousand years ago but he got it

1618.48 --> 1622.24
right

1619.039 --> 1624.24
two thousand years ago two

1622.24 --> 1625.679
thousand years ago not a chance it's all

1624.24 --> 1628.0
out go right ahead

1625.679 --> 1628.72
and aristotle's noticed that there was a

1628.0 --> 1632.32
town called

1628.72 --> 1634.4
cyan and on a certain date the sun

1632.32 --> 1635.4399999999998
would actually shine straight down to

1634.4 --> 1637.44
the bottom of a well

1635.44 --> 1639.6000000000001
two thousand years ago that meant the

1637.44 --> 1641.919
sun was directly overhead you could look

1639.6 --> 1642.8799999999999
down a well and see the sun shining back

1641.919 --> 1645.8400000000001
at you

1642.88 --> 1647.279
and on the very same date farther away

1645.84 --> 1649.76
in the city of alexandria

1647.279 --> 1651.76
that didn't happen that didn't happen

1649.76 --> 1652.84
the sun was not directly overhead it was

1651.76 --> 1655.679
a slight

1652.84 --> 1657.279
angle that meant the sun was directly

1655.679 --> 1659.44
overhead

1657.279 --> 1660.559
the sun was not directly overhead with a

1659.44 --> 1662.72
slight angle

1660.559 --> 1664.799
in fact as i was talking to the folks

1662.72 --> 1669.039
from sempra they were explaining that

1664.799 --> 1671.76
this location is almost optimal for

1669.039 --> 1672.48
solar power generation not only because

1671.76 --> 1674.64
it's flat

1672.48 --> 1675.76
transmission lines we're already here

1674.64 --> 1678.3990000000001
the sun

1675.76 --> 1680.96
is traveling and it's there's no haze

1678.399 --> 1683.279
and it's absolutely clear and so

1680.96 --> 1685.6000000000001
this is an extraordinary opportunity for

1683.279 --> 1687.2
the community

1685.6 --> 1688.6399999999999
if some of these folks were around when

1687.2 --> 1690.64
columbus set sail

1688.64 --> 1692.5590000000002
that didn't happen yeah these guys were

1690.64 --> 1695.919
around when columbus set sail

1692.559 --> 1697.84
that didn't happen they were they must

1695.919 --> 1699.6000000000001
have been founding members of the flat

1697.84 --> 1701.039
earth society that didn't happen

1699.6 --> 1703.36
they'd be charter members of the flat

1701.039 --> 1706.48
earth society that didn't happen

1703.36 --> 1708.7199999999998

1706.48 --> 1710.0
it has no atmosphere it has nothing it

is the absence of

1714.0 --> 1718.88
space is completely empty everybody

1717.2 --> 1722.32
knows the earth is a sphere

1718.88 --> 1724.96
right space is completely

1722.32 --> 1726.799
empty everybody knows that seeing the

1724.96 --> 1730.24
pictures

1726.799 --> 1733.679
space or a geoid very close to a sphere

1730.24 --> 1733.679
is completely empty

1735.679 --> 1739.8400000000001
completely empty

1740.08 --> 1743.36
completely empty

1744.64 --> 1749.1200000000001
that is the emptiness that is an

1746.799 --> 1752.57
emptiness that you can't

1749.12 --> 1755.6799999999998

1860.72 --> 1863.919
when

1861.6 --> 1864.7199999999998
it was being talked about then because i

mars with the telescope the sun the moon

made somebody who was who was more

they're like you're right

future

1967.6 --> 1971.6789999999999
i didn't come here to tell you how this

to tell you how it's going to begin

1975.519 --> 1979.6
all right so

1980.0 --> 1983.44
yeah good stuff i hope i'm not gonna get

1982.48 --> 1987.76
a strike

1983.44 --> 1991.519
from that or something probably not

1987.76 --> 1992.799
not from the music anyway but yeah such

1991.519 --> 1997.279
a great video i

1992.799 --> 1997.279
think it's so hilarious that woman

1997.44 --> 2005.8400000000001
just can't believe it they actually left

2000.799 --> 2005.84

2017.279 --> 2020.159

direct permission from the original

2024.88 --> 2029.7600000000002
video maker so

2026.96 --> 2029.76
but yeah

2030.08 --> 2033.84
i think it'll be all right

2037.84 --> 2045.6789999999999
now i think at worst i'll just get a uh

2042.519 --> 2049.119
monetization uh re

2045.679 --> 2061.839
uh rerouting just like when i i did the

2049.119 --> 2061.839
last lord of the rings video clip

2073.44 --> 2079.919
right anyway uh yeah i post the link

2077.2 --> 2082.399
again it's funny spread it around

2079.919 --> 2082.399
and uh

2083.599 --> 2089.839
yeah that's that's really a nasa

2086.839 --> 2089.839
spokesperson

2089.84 --> 2093.099
[Music]

2093.119 --> 2097.52
i'm pretty sure they picked her just

2095.28 --> 2100.0
because of that

2097.52 --> 2102.0
they probably picked her because she was

2100.0 --> 2105.599
such a blabbler

2102.0 --> 2107.76
and they wanted that i don't know maybe

2105.599 --> 2109.6800000000003
because they wanted to appeal to more

2107.76 --> 2110.5600000000004
average type of people that'll go for

2109.68 --> 2117.5989999999997
that

2110.56 --> 2121.04
and make them feel comfortable

2117.599 --> 2123.3590000000004
fair use yeah sure

2121.04 --> 2125.2
i know the copyrights usually come in

2123.359 --> 2128.24
with

2125.2 --> 2130.3199999999997
uh with like studio

2128.24 --> 2131.839
video material like from series or

2130.32 --> 2135.52
movies or with

2131.839 --> 2138.7999999999997
very identifiable music

2135.52 --> 2141.92
from music groups or from

2138.8 --> 2144.1600000000003
copyrighted movie music

2141.92 --> 2145.52
you know and this music was just pretty

2144.16 --> 2148.96
generic

2145.52 --> 2149.28
and the video it was all nasa video so i

2148.96 --> 2152.64
guess

2149.28 --> 2152.6400000000003
fair use would just work

2152.8 --> 2156.079
but hey it was somebody else's video so

2154.8 --> 2158.48
i don't know

2156.079 --> 2159.2000000000003
anyway shout out to that guy whoever he

2158.48 --> 2162.2400000000002
is

2159.2 --> 2165.9199999999996
just it just said flat earth that's all

2162.24 --> 2173.839
so oh yeah and the video was around for

2165.92 --> 2173.839
already a year

2202.16 --> 2215.839
right so anyway 10 more minutes roughly

2217.76 --> 2220.96
any questions or

2221.68 --> 2225.44
or yeah things you'd like to inform me

2224.72 --> 2229.839
about

2225.44 --> 2229.839
you think my i might be interested in

2254.839 --> 2257.839
hmm

2268.839 --> 2271.839
one

2286.4 --> 2289.839

2324.839 --> 2327.839
see

2341.44 --> 2345.359
yeah matthew mitchell i

2345.44 --> 2349.2400000000002
i put the link in chat twice already

2347.68 --> 2350.56
it's the facebook link

2349.24 --> 2352.24
[Music]

2350.56 --> 2355.839
and you don't need to be logged in on

2352.24 --> 2355.839
facebook to see it so

2361.599 --> 2366.48
if you had a facebook account you could

2363.359 --> 2366.48
probably download it

2366.96 --> 2371.03
and then maybe upload it on youtube

2369.04 --> 2374.229

uh

2377.44 --> 2382.0
yeah amanda young hello you're late

2380.0 --> 2397.839
you're very busy it seems

2382.0 --> 2397.839
that's okay

2404.0 --> 2408.48
hey yeah julio pepin thank you for the

2406.88 --> 2412.1600000000003
five dollar super chat donation

2408.48 --> 2412.16
super chat is indeed working

2415.839 --> 2421.92
i hope paypal is working too

2419.599 --> 2423.52
now it is paypal hasn't given me any

2421.92 --> 2427.28
real trouble

2423.52 --> 2427.28
since i first started using it

2428.96 --> 2435.76
but yeah they are not they're not like

2432.319 --> 2438.88
superhero bankers either these people

2435.76 --> 2442.5600000000004
are yeah also

2438.88 --> 2444.96
into our onto the whole rainbow flag

2442.56 --> 2446.48
corporation situation as well

2444.96 --> 2449.44
so i have to take that into

2446.48 --> 2451.68
consideration you know i like paypal so

2449.44 --> 2452.88
far they haven't gotten in my way in any

2451.68 --> 2455.359
way

2452.88 --> 2456.1600000000003
but i do realize that at some point i

2455.359 --> 2461.119
might

2456.16 --> 2466.16
truly have to try and get another source

2461.119 --> 2468.1600000000003
for my financial internet exchanges

2466.16 --> 2469.52
i don't know of anything yet that would

2468.16 --> 2473.2
match and hey for now

2469.52 --> 2475.359
they're not really giving me any trouble

2473.2 --> 2475.359
so

2478.4 --> 2482.1600000000003
yeah elon musk i know

2491.68 --> 2494.72
yeah you know in a way i think that

2493.359 --> 2497.92
maybe just like

2494.72 --> 2501.2799999999997
facebook and like uh

2497.92 --> 2504.16
youtube that paypal may have also been

2501.28 --> 2504.1600000000003
kind of like a

2504.8 --> 2511.44
what is it secret service based project

2508.48 --> 2512.96
except in this case for banking for

2511.44 --> 2514.8
online banking

2512.96 --> 2518.56
that it might have been one of the

2514.8 --> 2518.5600000000004
original startup projects

2520.0 --> 2525.76
because it's probably also being used

2523.119 --> 2527.119
to kind of keep track of money transfers

2525.76 --> 2530.5600000000004
so they're not gonna

2527.119 --> 2532.319
try to suck you dry with it but because

2530.56 --> 2535.2799999999997
it is so open

2532.319 --> 2537.68
there more people will just use it

2535.28 --> 2539.2000000000003
spontaneously without consideration or

2537.68 --> 2541.68
maybe it will cost me too much or

2539.2 --> 2545.9199999999996
something and that will give it

2541.68 --> 2545.9199999999996
very clean metadata

2546.56 --> 2552.64
see so i think it's one of those

2550.16 --> 2564.44
just like facebook and just kind of just

2552.64 --> 2568.2799999999997
like youtube as well

2564.44 --> 2568.28
[Music]

2572.68 --> 2579.839

[Music]

2602.16 --> 2608.0789999999997
puppy dog yeah

2606.079 --> 2609.76
well the amount of people over here in

2608.079 --> 2613.52
the netherlands with dogs i think

2609.76 --> 2617.0400000000004
has increased also a lot you know

2613.52 --> 2619.68
because i don't think that

2617.04 --> 2620.72
like men and women connect as easy as

2619.68 --> 2624.319
they used to

2620.72 --> 2626.24
like say 20 years ago or before that

2624.319 --> 2629.04
and there's a lot of lonely people out

2626.24 --> 2632.64
there that get dogs

2629.04 --> 2633.599
like really a lot especially little

2632.64 --> 2635.68
older like

2633.599 --> 2638.1600000000003
the younger ones still kind of like hang

2635.68 --> 2640.48
around with their

2638.16 --> 2644.3999999999996
[Music]

2640.48 --> 2646.4
their little groups ugh

2644.4 --> 2647.44
don't yeah i want to get into that but a

2646.4 --> 2650.4
lot of people

2647.44 --> 2651.839
that are older that don't really fit in

2650.4 --> 2655.52
like that anymore

2651.839 --> 2657.2
they all get dogs most of them

2655.52 --> 2659.52
so you'll see a lot of people with dogs

2657.2 --> 2662.319
out there and hey it's good you know

2659.52 --> 2663.44
they are good companions and through

2662.319 --> 2665.04
getting dogs

2663.44 --> 2668.079
you get to know other people that are

2665.04 --> 2671.04
getting dogs so

2668.079 --> 2673.8390000000004
it yeah it does them a lot of good like

2671.04 --> 2676.72
sometimes i even think like oh

2673.839 --> 2679.68
having a dog would definitely give me

2676.72 --> 2681.68
opportunity to get to know other people

2679.68 --> 2684.24
problem is is that yeah i don't want to

2681.68 --> 2684.24
have a dog

2686.24 --> 2691.839
because i'm more of a cat person

2696.4 --> 2700.7200000000003
maybe i'd get a dog if i'd had a

2698.72 --> 2704.0
girlfriend

2700.72 --> 2706.48
like as a tryout to like because

2704.0 --> 2707.04
yeah it's like half a kid you always

2706.48 --> 2708.96
have to be

2707.04 --> 2710.64
you can't leave them and all that to

2708.96 --> 2719.839
kind of try it out

2710.64 --> 2719.839
i don't know we'll see

2724.4 --> 2729.52
oh dear okay i just watch out thanks for

2727.599 --> 2732.4
popping by

2729.52 --> 2734.319
yeah don't eat that cream cake all at

2732.4 --> 2737.44
once

2734.319 --> 2737.44
but do enjoy

2738.56 --> 2746.72
get a snake no thank you no

2742.079 --> 2748.5600000000004
no i don't like just

2746.72 --> 2752.72
knowing that a creature that i like is

2748.56 --> 2754.56
constantly just eating mice and [ __ ]

2752.72 --> 2757.839
i know somebody that does have snakes

2754.56 --> 2762.16
though one of my d d players

2757.839 --> 2762.16
the one that works in a dinosaur museum

2765.04 --> 2767.92
and you know

2768.079 --> 2772.319
no but snakes are kind of cute really if

2771.04 --> 2775.04
they're really

2772.319 --> 2776.0
from birth tamed then they're actually

2775.04 --> 2779.599
nice they don't

2776.0 --> 2781.599
yeah i don't know although what i find

2779.599 --> 2783.04
weird about most snakes is that their

2781.599 --> 2788.2400000000002
skin kind of feels

2783.04 --> 2790.48
weird and rubbery it's so odd

2788.24 --> 2792.56
so i guess if you yeah the touch of a

2790.48 --> 2794.8
snake might feel a little creepy i get

2792.56 --> 2794.7999999999997
that

2795.76 --> 2802.0
but they're i don't know tame snakes are

2798.8 --> 2804.079
really kind of gentle

2802.0 --> 2806.079
don't have like any lashing out

2804.079 --> 2809.52
instincts or anything

2806.079 --> 2812.6400000000003
that wild snakes have so

2809.52 --> 2816.079
oh hundreds of snakes damn

2812.64 --> 2818.16
right well anyway i'm not really a snake

2816.079 --> 2821.44
person you know

2818.16 --> 2824.56
in general i prefer animals that can

2821.44 --> 2826.56
kind of that are half in the wild that's

2824.56 --> 2828.319
why i like the birds out here so much

2826.56 --> 2830.72
because they know me they know

2828.319 --> 2832.24
what i do that i provide water on a

2830.72 --> 2834.48
regular basis

2832.24 --> 2836.56
they sort of improvise communicating

2834.48 --> 2838.64
with me they analyze me so

2836.56 --> 2842.5589999999997
yeah they are in contact with me but

2838.64 --> 2842.5589999999997
there's completely self-reliant

2843.28 --> 2847.2000000000003
so and the same goes with cats in

2845.599 --> 2848.48
general you know yeah you should feed

2847.2 --> 2850.72
the carriage but yeah if you

2848.48 --> 2853.2
if you don't feed them at least let them

2850.72 --> 2853.2
outside

2853.28 --> 2855.76
but yeah

2856.4 --> 2859.839
i would always feed a cat

2860.48 --> 2863.52
but they can take care of themselves and

2862.64 --> 2866.72
they're very good

2863.52 --> 2869.04
beggars as well

2866.72 --> 2872.16
so and if they're too good at it they'll

2869.04 --> 2873.68
probably get really really fat because

2872.16 --> 2874.72
there's just plenty of people out there

2873.68 --> 2876.96
that'll be like oh

2874.72 --> 2878.48
so cute kitty and they wanted the kitty

2876.96 --> 2880.2400000000002
to come off them so they gave them a

2878.48 --> 2882.079
little snack and yeah then the kitty

2880.24 --> 2884.839
comes every day

2882.079 --> 2887.599
and then he does like five people like

2884.839 --> 2890.7999999999997
that

2887.599 --> 2894.8
anyway i'm gonna round out the show

2890.8 --> 2894.8
oh your dog is really sick that sucks

2899.839 --> 2904.88
all right i hope he pulls through that

2905.76 --> 2910.559
hmm yeah good luck with the with the
