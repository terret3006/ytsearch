79.119 --> 82.4

and was kind of hard to get out it's

82.4 --> 86.24000000000001
like ah

84.159 --> 88.64
that was nice so i started out a bit

uh good

92.24 --> 94.55999999999999

i don't remember how late it was there's

98.56 --> 104.56
plenty of stuff going

100.0 --> 106.479
on right so let's go through the list

104.56 --> 109.52
quickly

106.479 --> 113.119
well as quick as i can readdress

109.52 --> 114.88
things later on when more people get in

113.119 --> 118.719
hello there here we go again

114.88 --> 122.32
is first so yeah yesterday

118.719 --> 123.759
yesterday john d energy videos first

122.32 --> 126.479
thing i watched in the flat

123.759 --> 128.16
flat earth early bird show apparently

126.479 --> 129.759
there's another video i haven't gotten

128.16 --> 131.44
to watching it but there's already a

129.759 --> 136.55999999999997
second part uploaded

131.44 --> 136.56
i should watch that somewhere this day

138.64 --> 145.51999999999998
later on open benjamin went live and was

142.879 --> 147.51999999999998
really funny again oh yeah it's always

145.52 --> 151.04000000000002
funny it's always amusing

147.52 --> 156.16000000000003
apparently a new piece on joe rogan

151.04 --> 159.35999999999999
it just keeps on spiraling downwards

156.16 --> 162.319
into the butthole this is

159.36 --> 162.31900000000002
and yeah it's just

163.28 --> 166.8
what you put together it's just like

165.2 --> 169.92
yeah

166.8 --> 170.31900000000002
what do you expect you know it's almost

169.92 --> 173.28
like

170.319 --> 174.64
he's a like joe is aiming for that [ __ ]

173.28 --> 176.72
on purpose

174.64 --> 178.95899999999997
it that's so weird about it and

176.72 --> 183.519
sometimes i think that

178.959 --> 184.0
this thing like how they supposedly get

183.519 --> 188.959
to the

184.0 --> 192.319
top by starting to adapt these specific

188.959 --> 193.44
things like being gay or not having

192.319 --> 196.72
children or being

193.44 --> 200.64
eugenicist or being irresponsible or

196.72 --> 202.64
just anything that's off logos

200.64 --> 203.76
and then i think sometimes that people

202.64 --> 206.72
that actually do that

203.76 --> 206.72
that they want

207.28 --> 213.76
to be basically

210.879 --> 215.12
put in pits and made fun of i almost

213.76 --> 217.76
think that they do

215.12 --> 218.959
at that point it's really weird how that

217.76 --> 221.12
works

218.959 --> 222.72
because they just make it too easy to do

221.12 --> 224.959
that

222.72 --> 227.28
so i wonder if there's this weird secret

224.959 --> 229.28
little alchemy that's also going on

227.28 --> 231.84
like that and it's like you can't really

229.28 --> 231.84
escape it

234.48 --> 237.67999999999998
yeah it's weird how that works so i

236.64 --> 241.27999999999997
think sometimes that

237.68 --> 241.68
that joe in his own dark little twisted

241.28 --> 244.959
way

241.68 --> 245.59900000000002
is playing everybody specifically to do

244.959 --> 248.64000000000001
that

245.599 --> 251.04
it's almost like the what used to be

248.64 --> 253.35999999999999
the alex jones tactic of just getting in

251.04 --> 257.44
your face and over the top

253.36 --> 259.35900000000004
because then he would become a hot item

257.44 --> 261.519
in response and that would bring a lot

259.359 --> 264.56
of attention

261.519 --> 268.479
and joe's doing that in his own

264.56 --> 271.36
yeah little way as it were

268.479 --> 273.52
and yeah didn't even address that just

271.36 --> 275.759
but it's that that feeling i get every

273.52 --> 275.75899999999996
time

276.96 --> 281.52
and hey i i literally call for

279.8 --> 284.72
roguenzing up

281.52 --> 286.88
and all that so the way that i'm

284.72 --> 288.0
sort of contributing to it as well it's

286.88 --> 290.08
just a weird

288.0 --> 291.44
sensation i get about it i wonder

290.08 --> 293.35999999999996
sometimes like

291.44 --> 295.04
maybe i should just completely ignore it

293.36 --> 299.04
instead

295.04 --> 299.04
like i don't watch his shows anyway

300.4 --> 304.32
like at all it's just i'm not interested

302.56 --> 306.29
anymore it's just annoying

304.32 --> 309.339
to me

306.29 --> 309.339
[Music]

309.36 --> 312.88
like when's the last time you heard him

311.759 --> 315.36
bring something

312.88 --> 317.6
really new to the table that wasn't just

315.36 --> 317.6
some

318.08 --> 321.28
some science fiction reified or

320.0 --> 322.88
something you know

321.28 --> 325.19899999999996
i don't know i don't know how many of

322.88 --> 326.96
you actually watch his shows sometimes

325.199 --> 329.6
so

326.96 --> 332.15999999999997
anyway yeah i went on later on the 24 7

329.6 --> 332.16
discord

332.24 --> 339.44
again it was pretty fun although

335.68 --> 341.919
i think that pillbox that guy

339.44 --> 344.32
he really doesn't like me because i was

341.919 --> 346.96
just trying to get in there but

344.32 --> 348.32
i kind of yeah what i do you know i

346.96 --> 349.75899999999996
start really talking

348.32 --> 352.15999999999997
but there were some people in there that

349.759 --> 354.24
i just i feel connected to them eat very

352.16 --> 354.88000000000005
easily so the conversation just rolls

354.24 --> 358.319
out

354.88 --> 360.15999999999997
he didn't like that at all

358.319 --> 361.6
not that he addressed it but he would

360.16 --> 363.91900000000004
just start

361.6 --> 366.40000000000003
groping halfway over what i was saying

363.919 --> 368.0
and then starting a new subject

366.4 --> 370.71999999999997
did that like three times so it was kind

368.0 --> 373.44
of annoying eventually he left though

370.72 --> 374.96000000000004
but i know i just it's not the first

373.44 --> 378.319
time

374.96 --> 378.88
it's okay as i said before some people

378.319 --> 382.40000000000003
just

378.88 --> 383.68
can't stand me they just don't want me

382.4 --> 388.88
to be there

383.68 --> 388.88
in their presence even if it's virtually

390.0 --> 393.84
right and much later even lift the veil

392.4 --> 397.35999999999996
went live again

393.84 --> 397.35999999999996
sort of halfway paid attention

397.44 --> 400.8
because sometimes he like brings kind of

399.759 --> 405.12
fresh details

400.8 --> 405.12
off the streets and all that it can be

406.84 --> 409.84
interesting

412.479 --> 415.84
right yeah that's pretty much it oh

415.36 --> 419.599
benji

415.84 --> 423.84
yeah nana with that sleeping warrior

419.599 --> 423.84
trying out somebody else's unicycle

425.52 --> 429.28
that video that was kind of funny

433.919 --> 437.84
yeah that's pretty much it

438.639 --> 442.56
so sunday 13th

448.4 --> 451.84
all right

453.12 --> 456.639
so who else is here

462.84 --> 468.08
right yeah i noticed by the way

466.0 --> 470.8
that also since yesterday i started

468.08 --> 474.31899999999996
really noticing i'm slowing down again

470.8 --> 474.319
so i've been over my peak

475.12 --> 478.879
in just like i'm doing good you know i'm

478.319 --> 481.36
much

478.879 --> 482.47900000000004
better because when i get all hot and

481.36 --> 484.16
[ __ ]

482.479 --> 485.599
it comes also with kind of an

484.16 --> 489.12
instability

485.599 --> 490.87899999999996
it's kind of an uneasiness

489.12 --> 493.12
and that uneasiness is going away and

490.879 --> 493.84000000000003
that also results in that i get a little

493.12 --> 497.759
bit

493.84 --> 501.919
slower take it easy

497.759 --> 504.319
more i hope you guys don't mind but yeah

501.919 --> 506.479
those that follow me regularly like or

504.319 --> 508.639
for over a year they know i work like

506.479 --> 512.88
this

508.639 --> 514.5600000000001
ah all right ah

512.88 --> 517.519
i thought you would here we go again

514.56 --> 520.4789999999999
yeah yeah we talked about that over chat

517.519 --> 521.519
two days ago yeah it is a really good

520.479 --> 524.5600000000001
series

521.519 --> 526.64
i'm glad you're enjoying it like that

524.56 --> 527.8389999999999
first season can be a bit of a chore to

526.64 --> 530.959
get through some

527.839 --> 532.8800000000001
really stupid woody moments

530.959 --> 534.2399999999999
when it just really breaks the suspense

532.88 --> 536.72
of disbelief but

534.24 --> 537.279
beyond that like the story really starts

536.72 --> 539.2
building

537.279 --> 541.04
and the characters really start to get

539.2 --> 545.9200000000001
serious

541.04 --> 545.92
and it's yeah good memories from that

546.88 --> 551.279
so yeah seeing that for the first time

548.64 --> 553.12
must be quite a thrill

551.279 --> 554.8
that now that's real science fiction

553.12 --> 558.0
isn't it

554.8 --> 559.5999999999999
i've always had like babylon 5 on the

558.0 --> 561.519
highest standard

559.6 --> 563.6800000000001
the highest pedestal of science fiction

561.519 --> 564.88
like yeah that's really what makes

563.68 --> 567.5999999999999
science fiction great

564.88 --> 567.92
it's pretty much what happens in there

567.6 --> 571.279
and

567.92 --> 573.8389999999999
on the level that they do it you know

571.279 --> 575.68
so many science fiction things obsess

573.839 --> 578.5600000000001
over a single thing and then completely

575.68 --> 582.0799999999999
overdo it no no babylon 5 is like

578.56 --> 585.4399999999999
it really keeps that level

582.08 --> 588.08
that makes it seemingly real and it's

585.44 --> 588.08
like very

588.48 --> 595.76
very good at it and it stays like that

591.92 --> 595.76
that's amazing like all throughout it

595.839 --> 598.9590000000001
like at the end you just you watch the

598.32 --> 600.8000000000001
characters

598.959 --> 602.8
and you literally feel like how

600.8 --> 605.8389999999999
compacted they are with their history

602.8 --> 606.8
it's pretty incredible it's i've never

605.839 --> 609.0400000000001
seen it

606.8 --> 610.8
achieved to that level in any kind of

609.04 --> 613.12
science fiction series

610.8 --> 614.64
like not even star trek when they got

613.12 --> 619.839
all over and all that it

614.64 --> 619.8389999999999
just not like this

631.44 --> 639.519
right hey hello terminoid

635.12 --> 639.519
brand m cameron gilmore good to see you

640.399 --> 646.72
third and fourth season best

643.6 --> 647.36
yeah yeah i'd agree that's really that's

646.72 --> 649.839
like

647.36 --> 651.12
in the middle when the acceleration

649.839 --> 655.44
development is

651.12 --> 655.44
the highest level yes i agree

656.72 --> 661.839
every second episode though um

666.24 --> 668.48
right

671.44 --> 676.0
yeah and the movies like some of them

674.399 --> 679.76
are like

676.0 --> 682.32
like just really extended series

679.76 --> 684.0
basically but some of the movies are

682.32 --> 686.88
just amazing

684.0 --> 687.44
like really like almost like an entire

686.88 --> 691.92
season

687.44 --> 691.9200000000001
in one big movie it's quite incredible

693.12 --> 696.079
invisible man

696.72 --> 700.8000000000001
jacob was yeah yeah yeah he is like a

699.04 --> 705.8389999999999
sight

700.8 --> 709.12
the psycho oh what a character

705.839 --> 711.36
that's that's like a really awesome spy

709.12 --> 715.04
character

711.36 --> 718.0790000000001
psycho yes corpse

715.04 --> 721.68
i thought that psycho was really like

718.079 --> 723.04
dude that appealed the [ __ ] out of me if

721.68 --> 726.16
you know what i mean

723.04 --> 730.74
because the way that they do that is

726.16 --> 734.169
very real this is it's just exaggerated

730.74 --> 734.169
[Music]

735.76 --> 740.639
right anyway yeah your mind's going to

739.76 --> 745.8389999999999
be blown

740.639 --> 745.839
a whole lot of times

753.76 --> 757.92
makes me want to download it again and

756.0 --> 759.68
watch it again it's a really good series

757.92 --> 763.76
and i know

759.68 --> 765.76
it'll be good do have the hard disk room

763.76 --> 768.0
yeah i might actually download it myself

765.76 --> 768.0
again

770.32 --> 773.839
all right

782.16 --> 786.65
[Music]

788.88 --> 795.92
right so anyway yeah

792.72 --> 796.5600000000001
i remember fondly yesterday how somebody

795.92 --> 799.68
asked me

796.56 --> 803.1199999999999
to explain the rectangular looping

799.68 --> 804.8
and then i put down some good stuff

803.12 --> 807.279
it's good to do that again it's really

804.8 --> 811.4399999999999
rare isn't it these days

807.279 --> 814.0
like i barely even i just

811.44 --> 814.72
i caught like the last few years i kind

814.0 --> 816.32
of like just

814.72 --> 818.5600000000001
brought it forth like but this is an

816.32 --> 820.399
option and then but then everybody would

818.56 --> 821.199
kind of turn against me and i'd be like

820.399 --> 825.279
yes

821.199 --> 827.5999999999999
i am defending this but now

825.279 --> 830.079
like those people know that they kind of

827.6 --> 834.48
forget about it maybe

830.079 --> 836.56
and then i'll just quickly sneak it in

834.48 --> 837.839
and try not to expand upon it too much

836.56 --> 840.56
because then people will start

837.839 --> 843.519
complaining

840.56 --> 844.3199999999999
unless it's specifically asked but i

843.519 --> 846.88
don't know why

844.32 --> 849.839
why everybody's also stuck up over the

846.88 --> 851.6
potential of a looping space

849.839 --> 855.0400000000001
i don't know why they get so stuck up

851.6 --> 858.24
over this i really don't like why

855.04 --> 860.16
like would it matter like if it turns

858.24 --> 862.399
out to be reality

860.16 --> 863.92
oh you don't think it's possible yeah

862.399 --> 865.839
but what if it is possible it's not

863.92 --> 867.8389999999999
going to matter because the world is

865.839 --> 870.639
still the world

867.839 --> 873.519
as you experience it so if it turns out

870.639 --> 876.88
to be that would it really matter

873.519 --> 881.519
for your life no no it wouldn't

876.88 --> 883.199
it just gives you a new perspective

881.519 --> 885.44
on what might be possible a new

883.199 --> 887.68
direction of theorizing even

885.44 --> 887.6800000000001
see

889.279 --> 893.4399999999999
maybe because it's a reification how

891.199 --> 893.4399999999999
what

896.32 --> 904.1600000000001
hey mr salim are you addressing me

900.72 --> 906.24
how is it a reification fallacy

904.16 --> 908.48
the concept as as explained i'm not

906.24 --> 910.5600000000001
trying to reify it into signs because it

908.48 --> 914.399
falls under cosmogeny

910.56 --> 914.399
and you can't very manipulate it

915.839 --> 922.0
at least i haven't thought of a way

918.88 --> 925.12
like because

922.0 --> 929.12
the yeah because it deals with

925.12 --> 929.12
like with space

929.279 --> 932.88
things that like not phenomenon like

931.759 --> 936.72
that it's just like

932.88 --> 938.88
a cosmogeny phenomenon like oh

936.72 --> 940.399
the loop from this length to that length

938.88 --> 941.279
and at that point it's from this length

940.399 --> 943.839
to that length

941.279 --> 946.079
it's like yeah it doesn't fall under the

943.839 --> 949.12
scientific method parameter so

946.079 --> 949.12
i never claimed that

951.759 --> 955.759
right yeah cameron gilmore yeah isn't

954.079 --> 958.2399999999999
that just ironic oh

955.759 --> 959.759
because it reminds them of something the

958.24 --> 962.8
helios interest

959.759 --> 963.92
basically stole from reality but helios

962.8 --> 966.639
test enters steal

963.92 --> 968.959
everything from reality and then adapt

966.639 --> 970.48
it to some other order

968.959 --> 973.279
in their science fiction realm they do

970.48 --> 973.279
this all the time

973.36 --> 976.399
so oh because heliocentrism has

975.839 --> 979.2790000000001
something

976.399 --> 982.959
that sounds like it in it so that means

979.279 --> 985.279
it's stupid

982.959 --> 986.56
i guess that with the experience of

985.279 --> 990.079
gravity

986.56 --> 990.88
that's also happening but yeah it's very

990.079 --> 994.88
easy

990.88 --> 998.48
to just disprove gravity

994.88 --> 1000.639
because it is like yeah claimed to be

998.48 --> 1004.0
science and definitely is not

1000.639 --> 1010.0790000000001
you know but when it comes to cosmogeny

1004.0 --> 1012.399
it's different it's a different level

1010.079 --> 1013.5999999999999
so i'm not trying to reify it i'm just

1012.399 --> 1015.759
saying wait

1013.6 --> 1019.36
it might be a possibility that this may

1015.759 --> 1022.5600000000001
be the outcome of certain tests

1019.36 --> 1023.12
how do you conceive of how things could

1022.56 --> 1027.28
be

1023.12 --> 1031.12
in the face of such potential results

1027.28 --> 1031.12
that's what i do i'm a theorist

1031.839 --> 1042.1599999999999
or colloquial theorist if you will

1039.76 --> 1043.22
i try to conceive of things through

1042.16 --> 1046.39
logic

1043.22 --> 1046.39
[Music]

1051.039 --> 1055.039
proposing a model without

1052.96 --> 1058.4
experimentation

1055.039 --> 1060.96
no but every time i propose something

1058.4 --> 1060.96
a test

1062.08 --> 1067.1999999999998
that is experimentation it's not

1064.24 --> 1069.84
scientific experimentation again because

1067.2 --> 1070.72
whatever is discussed being figured out

1069.84 --> 1072.8799999999999
doesn't fall

1070.72 --> 1074.799
under the parameters of scientific

1072.88 --> 1078.4
experimentation of

1074.799 --> 1079.9189999999999
hypotheses it doesn't abide by science i

1078.4 --> 1082.48
can't do anything about does that mean

1079.919 --> 1086.3200000000002
that we just should not do anything

1082.48 --> 1089.919
you know like that makes no sense

1086.32 --> 1092.32
i want to figure out how this works

1089.919 --> 1095.039
so just because i can't use science does

1092.32 --> 1098.08
it mean that i can't

1095.039 --> 1098.96
figure it out that doesn't seem very

1098.08 --> 1101.76
fair

1098.96 --> 1109.8400000000001
like why would i have to be restricted

1101.76 --> 1109.84
like that

1111.12 --> 1115.3799999999999
right okay

1112.25 --> 1115.38
[Music]

1117.6 --> 1121.12
but yeah everything is a time and a

1119.12 --> 1122.8799999999999
place and i think that when people start

1121.12 --> 1124.8799999999999
to think about who

1122.88 --> 1127.2800000000002
when when they basically start saying we

1124.88 --> 1130.4
want to explore beyond the antarctic

1127.28 --> 1132.799
right well then you're dealing

1130.4 --> 1135.3600000000001
then you're basically engaging in i want

1132.799 --> 1137.12
to try to figure out what this realm is

1135.36 --> 1139.039
or if you're gonna engage in that it's

1137.12 --> 1142.559
not scientific it isn't

1139.039 --> 1145.84
it is not in any way scientific so then

1142.559 --> 1150.32
i feel that i have the right

1145.84 --> 1152.6399999999999
to bring up the what-if situations

1150.32 --> 1154.0
like okay so what if there's an entire

1152.64 --> 1157.2
realm there

1154.0 --> 1158.96
what if that realm has the same equator

1157.2 --> 1161.44
length the same setup

1158.96 --> 1163.039
as this realm and it goes in a circle

1161.44 --> 1164.559
let's just say it goes in a circle and

1163.039 --> 1166.559
then it's like yeah it goes around

1164.559 --> 1167.76
it's very big of course because it goes

1166.559 --> 1170.8799999999999
around

1167.76 --> 1171.28
our known rome and the disk right oh but

1170.88 --> 1175.0390000000002
with

1171.28 --> 1177.12
if the equator length is not the same

1175.039 --> 1179.039
or is it's not like what is it should it

1177.12 --> 1182.08
be like three times

1179.039 --> 1182.559
as big or something no it's the same

1182.08 --> 1185.039
length

1182.559 --> 1185.6
but it goes around in a circle how can

1185.039 --> 1188.8799999999999
that be

1185.6 --> 1189.52
huh maybe space is not entirely linear

1188.88 --> 1191.3600000000001
it may

1189.52 --> 1193.28
yeah that's what you get and then

1191.36 --> 1194.0
everybody can get all warped and oh it's

1193.28 --> 1196.32
all

1194.0 --> 1198.08
warped over the place and oh my god i

1196.32 --> 1201.12
can't think about it yeah that's where

1198.08 --> 1201.52
freaking i come in that's what i'm for

1201.12 --> 1204.9599999999998
here

1201.52 --> 1208.32
i'm your planar explorer

1204.96 --> 1211.2
this i can make sense of it

1208.32 --> 1213.28
please just stop spiraling about that

1211.2 --> 1216.0
[ __ ] when you face it

1213.28 --> 1217.52
and start engaging in constructive

1216.0 --> 1221.84
thinking

1217.52 --> 1221.84
this is

1225.02 --> 1228.21
[Music]

1231.76 --> 1238.96
right and i've devised many conceptions

1235.679 --> 1238.96
concerning cosmogeny

1240.24 --> 1246.32
and i could do more it's just it gets a

1243.679 --> 1248.0800000000002
little freaky to myself especially if i

1246.32 --> 1249.36
feel like i'm just talking to people

1248.08 --> 1251.84
that don't really get it

1249.36 --> 1253.6399999999999
when i'm starting to talk about yeah

1251.84 --> 1257.6789999999999
what about

1253.64 --> 1258.3200000000002
irregular loops oh yeah what if it's

1257.679 --> 1261.44
like

1258.32 --> 1264.8799999999999
you're shaped like

1261.44 --> 1269.52
and looping in an irregular directive

1264.88 --> 1271.679
it could be really freaky for all i know

1269.52 --> 1272.559
doesn't make a lot of sense intuitively

1271.679 --> 1276.3200000000002
that it would be

1272.559 --> 1280.32
that warped but what if you know

1276.32 --> 1283.12
it's like i'm just not willing to say

1280.32 --> 1284.6399999999999
this is as far as i go if god presents

1283.12 --> 1286.6399999999999
something that is

1284.64 --> 1288.72
doesn't abide by these standards then

1286.64 --> 1292.7990000000002
i'll just go nuts

1288.72 --> 1295.44
yeah no no i am willing to face

1292.799 --> 1297.6
whatever surreal challenge reality poses

1295.44 --> 1301.52
to be

1297.6 --> 1302.6399999999999
i will go any length in trying to figure

1301.52 --> 1305.24
it out

1302.64 --> 1306.5590000000002
and i thought early on yeah spatial

1305.24 --> 1308.559
non-linearity

1306.559 --> 1310.6399999999999
if present in any form is going to be

1308.559 --> 1313.52
confusing as hell

1310.64 --> 1315.8400000000001
so i am going to try to make this my

1313.52 --> 1318.08
special mastery

1315.84 --> 1318.8799999999999
even if it turns out to completely not

1318.08 --> 1321.9189999999999
exist

1318.88 --> 1325.3600000000001
as a conception i'm figuring this out

1321.919 --> 1326.7990000000002
did that very very early on nobody

1325.36 --> 1328.4799999999998
really liked it

1326.799 --> 1331.36
or they thought oh that sounds science

1328.48 --> 1334.72
fictiony he made it up

1331.36 --> 1336.52
that's a very serious concept

1334.72 --> 1338.88
and it has nothing to do with

1336.52 --> 1340.96
einsteinian space-time bending

1338.88 --> 1342.3200000000002
at all just for the record it's

1340.96 --> 1345.1200000000001
completely different

1342.32 --> 1345.76
it's as different as the concept of an

1345.12 --> 1349.039
electric

1345.76 --> 1352.32
ether that fills the air with electrics

1349.039 --> 1355.52
potentially feeding the celestial lights

1352.32 --> 1358.559
and maybe even life itself or

1355.52 --> 1360.8799999999999
being the energy flow that creates the

1358.559 --> 1361.44
magnetic fields naturally on the earth's

1360.88 --> 1364.88
surface

1361.44 --> 1366.88
and all that and the light ether

1364.88 --> 1368.3200000000002
the medium for light to move in blah

1366.88 --> 1372.72
blah blah that

1368.32 --> 1375.6789999999999
it's about as similar as those two

1372.72 --> 1376.799
just for the record hey tin tony

1375.679 --> 1379.44
whitcomb

1376.799 --> 1382.0
good to see you good conversation

1379.44 --> 1382.0
yesterday

1384.08 --> 1389.84
in chat over at the flat earth debate

1386.84 --> 1389.84
premiere

1392.24 --> 1396.08
what does sleeping warrior have against

1394.0 --> 1403.84
wits it i don't know

1396.08 --> 1403.84
does he have anything against wits it

1409.52 --> 1414.0
i don't i don't think so i don't think

1411.6 --> 1414.3999999999999
tony has anything specifically against

1414.0 --> 1417.76
him

1414.4 --> 1420.96
i think he's just kind of

1417.76 --> 1421.6
maybe a little nervous defending the

1420.96 --> 1424.72
relative

1421.6 --> 1425.84
like the integrity of the relative

1424.72 --> 1428.96
density

1425.84 --> 1433.6
and because which it kind of also

1428.96 --> 1436.72
has been moving back and forth

1433.6 --> 1438.799
with his circles in

1436.72 --> 1440.559
acknowledging its full potential and

1438.799 --> 1442.08
then still trying to warm in other

1440.559 --> 1445.039
potential things

1442.08 --> 1446.48
i think that it makes tony nervous we've

1445.039 --> 1447.52
all addressed it at the flat earth

1446.48 --> 1450.72
debates

1447.52 --> 1454.4
but then again wits it also came on and

1450.72 --> 1458.0
showed that he definitely did understand

1454.4 --> 1461.279
so i don't know if tony's like

1458.0 --> 1464.88
sleeping warrior if he's

1461.279 --> 1466.559
being like overly suspicious or

1464.88 --> 1468.48
something i don't know

1466.559 --> 1471.2
i think that wits it gets it is a pretty

1468.48 --> 1471.2
interesting guy

1471.679 --> 1478.0
and he is very sharp

1474.88 --> 1480.88
like he doesn't screw around really like

1478.0 --> 1481.44
he likes to do it in his communication

1480.88 --> 1484.0
like

1481.44 --> 1485.76
try to be playful but i think that in

1484.0 --> 1487.6
his mind he doesn't really screw around

1485.76 --> 1489.76
a lot he might get distracted

1487.6 --> 1492.0
but he's very serious and i appreciate

1489.76 --> 1492.0
that

1493.919 --> 1498.0
water levitation with acoustics yeah yes

1496.0 --> 1500.799
i'm addicts sure i've seen that

1498.0 --> 1502.08
seen a lot of cymatics things you can

1500.799 --> 1504.6399999999999
also just lift

1502.08 --> 1504.6399999999999
objects

1511.2 --> 1515.8400000000001
all right

1518.48 --> 1524.48
domes on domes what is

1521.919 --> 1526.72
irregular loops what the what does that

1524.48 --> 1526.72
mean

1526.96 --> 1532.799
what dome do you speak of look

1530.159 --> 1533.2
if there is a loop in any fashion in the

1532.799 --> 1536.6399999999999
realm

1533.2 --> 1539.679
then the conception of the dome suddenly

1536.64 --> 1543.279
no longer really becomes a necessity

1539.679 --> 1546.159
because the dome is conceived

1543.279 --> 1546.88
to have to be there in order to

1546.159 --> 1550.88
basically

1546.88 --> 1551.44
form the container to contain the gas

1550.88 --> 1553.6000000000001
pressure

1551.44 --> 1554.559
a limited amount of space right that's

1553.6 --> 1557.36
really what the dome

1554.559 --> 1558.24
is being reified for because it has to

1557.36 --> 1560.9599999999998
be there

1558.24 --> 1561.84
if space is entirely linear and there's

1560.96 --> 1566.08
no loop

1561.84 --> 1568.559
if there is a loop you don't really need

1566.08 --> 1570.559
walls on the side at least of the

1568.559 --> 1572.559
container because the loop itself the

1570.559 --> 1575.76
limited amount of space

1572.559 --> 1576.24
simply allows the gas pressure to push

1575.76 --> 1579.12
against

1576.24 --> 1581.279
itself laterally and then there's going

1579.12 --> 1583.1999999999998
to still have to be a top somewhere

1581.279 --> 1584.4
because otherwise if there is unlimited

1583.2 --> 1586.24
space above

1584.4 --> 1587.76
then yeah you got the same problem in a

1586.24 --> 1590.24
fashion

1587.76 --> 1590.24
sort of

1590.96 --> 1596.559
like there can't be unlimited space

1594.08 --> 1597.6
vertically it's just an impossible so

1596.559 --> 1600.8799999999999
there should be then

1597.6 --> 1604.48
some kind of flat top or just a

1600.88 --> 1606.48
other thing that limits the space maybe

1604.48 --> 1607.919
just the end of space like at some point

1606.48 --> 1609.919
it's just

1607.919 --> 1611.76
like yeah not because there is a

1609.919 --> 1614.0800000000002
physical barrier obstructing you but

1611.76 --> 1617.2
because there's no more space

1614.08 --> 1620.32
to move into for anything physical

1617.2 --> 1623.6000000000001
so it will appear to

1620.32 --> 1626.3999999999999
one trying to go into that

1623.6 --> 1628.1589999999999
as if it is perfectly solid something

1626.4 --> 1630.3200000000002
like that

1628.159 --> 1633.0390000000002
yeah those are parts of my conceptions

1630.32 --> 1635.279
of what it could be like

1633.039 --> 1636.24
or maybe it's the freaking bottom of the

1635.279 --> 1639.2
realm

1636.24 --> 1640.32
that's looping in on us vertically

1639.2 --> 1643.039
something like that

1640.32 --> 1645.84
that could explain where meteors drop

1643.039 --> 1645.84
from and all that

1646.08 --> 1652.48
but yeah an actual physical dome

1650.159 --> 1653.5200000000002
which is in the bible never addressed

1652.48 --> 1656.559
exactly like that

1653.52 --> 1660.6399999999999
just wildly speculated upon it's not

1656.559 --> 1660.6399999999999
really necessary in a looping realm

1661.44 --> 1665.039
i've always found that to be very

1663.679 --> 1667.1200000000001
fascinating

1665.039 --> 1668.399
that i figured out like yeah it's not

1667.12 --> 1671.6
really necessary

1668.399 --> 1674.399
nobody liked it and nobody likes

1671.6 --> 1676.24
when they yeah when their physical dome

1674.399 --> 1678.8799999999999
that makes it easy to conceive

1676.24 --> 1679.52
of the situation nobody likes it when i

1678.88 --> 1683.8400000000001
take it

1679.52 --> 1683.84
away from them it seems

1686.24 --> 1691.919
does it require two mediums in order for

1689.44 --> 1695.44
refraction

1691.919 --> 1697.6000000000001
to the what i

1695.44 --> 1700.72
i don't know what that means when you

1697.6 --> 1700.7199999999998
say two mediums

1709.76 --> 1713.039
there's there's really only one medium

1711.84 --> 1717.279
for light

1713.039 --> 1722.96
and that's material

1717.279 --> 1722.96
transparent or less transparent

1723.36 --> 1739.53
so i don't really understand what you

1725.44 --> 1744.23
mean master celine

1739.53 --> 1744.23
[Music]

1751.6 --> 1759.84
refraction to take place right uh

1756.159 --> 1763.8400000000001
well it's just that refraction

1759.84 --> 1766.9599999999998
indexing is like the most

1763.84 --> 1768.24
prominent light path alteration effect

1766.96 --> 1771.2
and that requires

1768.24 --> 1772.3990000000001
a radical alteration in medium through

1771.2 --> 1775.76
which the light passes

1772.399 --> 1777.52
yes that's like that's why i

1775.76 --> 1779.039
specify that not just as general

1777.52 --> 1783.679
refraction effects

1779.039 --> 1786.8799999999999
out there in nature

1783.679 --> 1788.3200000000002
call that refraction indexing that i

1786.88 --> 1790.3990000000001
don't know that's the first time that i

1788.32 --> 1793.6
came across it is through

1790.399 --> 1794.08
uh 3d ray tracing programs very early

1793.6 --> 1798.559
ones

1794.08 --> 1802.96
imagine 3d took ages to render anything

1798.559 --> 1804.96
but like materials textures had specific

1802.96 --> 1806.88
properties and one of them was the

1804.96 --> 1808.08
refraction index and it was very

1806.88 --> 1811.0390000000002
fascinating because you could

1808.08 --> 1812.559
literally just alter it and then ins

1811.039 --> 1816.32
yeah

1812.559 --> 1818.32
see the difference i studied

1816.32 --> 1820.1589999999999
virtual refraction index it was

1818.32 --> 1823.12
extremely fascinating because i was like

1820.159 --> 1824.96
trying to build the right gem like i i

1823.12 --> 1826.32
didn't know the refraction index but it

1824.96 --> 1829.76
was just trying to

1826.32 --> 1832.96
do it on visual like

1829.76 --> 1833.919
does this look like an like it could be

1832.96 --> 1835.76
a real gem

1833.919 --> 1837.039
why why is this is this higher

1835.76 --> 1840.08
refraction index lower

1837.039 --> 1840.72
it's just always fooling around with

1840.08 --> 1842.24
that

1840.72 --> 1844.08
but that's when i really learned it's

1842.24 --> 1847.44
all about

1844.08 --> 1848.32
light going usually through air and then

1847.44 --> 1851.919
hitting

1848.32 --> 1853.76
a solid surface and then yeah

1851.919 --> 1855.1200000000001
depends on how thick that solid surface

1853.76 --> 1855.84
is there's going to already be a

1855.12 --> 1857.6789999999999
refraction

1855.84 --> 1859.6789999999999
index based alteration of the path of

1857.679 --> 1860.0800000000002
light and then when it exits it it kind

1859.679 --> 1864.72
of

1860.08 --> 1867.519
evens out bends back

1864.72 --> 1868.24
it's very interesting how that works and

1867.519 --> 1870.72
then if there's

1868.24 --> 1873.44
water behind there then it alters also

1870.72 --> 1876.64
because it's also very

1873.44 --> 1880.0800000000002
higher refraction index

1876.64 --> 1881.76
than air so that's kind of my first

1880.08 --> 1883.039
confrontation with the concept of

1881.76 --> 1885.44
refraction of light

1883.039 --> 1887.919
that's before i understood mirages and

1885.44 --> 1887.919
all that

1888.32 --> 1892.72
because mirages are just difficult to

1890.84 --> 1896.1589999999999
compare there's no

1892.72 --> 1897.1200000000001
dramatic refraction index alteration

1896.159 --> 1900.0
going on

1897.12 --> 1902.32
it's like gradual within the same medium

1900.0 --> 1906.24
there's like a

1902.32 --> 1909.76
i got it

1906.24 --> 1910.88
in homogeneous refraction alteration or

1909.76 --> 1914.48
just

1910.88 --> 1917.6000000000001
like a refraction index gradient

1914.48 --> 1918.88
alteration which is completely a counter

1917.6 --> 1921.76
opposite of just hard

1918.88 --> 1923.0390000000002
edge refraction index light path

1921.76 --> 1926.1589999999999
alteration

1923.039 --> 1928.48
it's completely different much

1926.159 --> 1929.679
less dramatic but that's why then it

1928.48 --> 1932.96
comes back into

1929.679 --> 1937.5500000000002
play over fast distances

1932.96 --> 1940.7
it's so weird it's so different

1937.55 --> 1940.7
[Music]

1944.08 --> 1950.799
ah did i

1947.12 --> 1953.039
cool i'm really going by

1950.799 --> 1954.6399999999999
how i learned it all so you gotta

1953.039 --> 1955.76
understand like i learned about the

1954.64 --> 1958.3200000000002
refraction index

1955.76 --> 1960.84
i knew that as i came to the table

1958.32 --> 1964.08
because it was part of my own

1960.84 --> 1965.039
interest like i like it was interested

1964.08 --> 1966.96
and like i just

1965.039 --> 1969.12
was very aware like yeah different gems

1966.96 --> 1969.8400000000001
have different refraction index it bends

1969.12 --> 1972.9599999999998
the

1969.84 --> 1974.08
light path then when you shine on the

1972.96 --> 1977.279
exact same gem

1974.08 --> 1978.6399999999999
cut you have two different types of gems

1977.279 --> 1981.84
like one diamond

1978.64 --> 1983.519
and one other transparent one and if you

1981.84 --> 1984.6399999999999
shine the same light on them from the

1983.519 --> 1988.3990000000001
same angle

1984.64 --> 1990.5590000000002
the amount of the pattern the glimmers

1988.399 --> 1992.32
that come out of it they're different

1990.559 --> 1994.48
because they have a different refraction

1992.32 --> 1995.4399999999998
index even though the gem is exactly the

1994.48 --> 1997.76
same

1995.44 --> 1999.919
shape exactly the same it's really

1997.76 --> 2002.08
interesting how that works

1999.919 --> 2003.6000000000001
i just was very well aware of that as i

2002.08 --> 2005.12
came to the table with the flat earth

2003.6 --> 2006.559
debates and all that

2005.12 --> 2008.32
and then when i was confronted like

2006.559 --> 2009.279
refraction like what terrestrial

2008.32 --> 2013.36
refraction what

2009.279 --> 2014.799
uh i just did not understand that at all

2013.36 --> 2016.559
and then i gradually learned a little

2014.799 --> 2018.6399999999999
bit more

2016.559 --> 2019.84
and then qe came into the picture really

2018.64 --> 2022.7990000000002
started laying down the

2019.84 --> 2024.6399999999999
the miraging and all that and then i

2022.799 --> 2026.799
just started like wait that

2024.64 --> 2029.2
that's different that's not the same

2026.799 --> 2031.12
setup but it is refraction is it really

2029.2 --> 2032.0800000000002
the same thing is it exactly the same

2031.12 --> 2035.36
effect

2032.08 --> 2035.36
why is it so different

2036.48 --> 2041.2
and now i get it i think i think i get

2039.039 --> 2041.2
it

2042.159 --> 2048.96
although i don't know

2045.279 --> 2052.079
i guess i would have to consult like a

2048.96 --> 2057.76
studied optics physic

2052.079 --> 2057.76
physics doctor or something

2058.72 --> 2062.3199999999997
and then maybe yeah they could confirm

2060.96 --> 2065.52
it now of course if they

2062.32 --> 2070.32
have globe indoctrination [ __ ]

2065.52 --> 2070.32
then that's not going to be very helpful

2070.96 --> 2075.599
but if they're willing to just be purely

2073.119 --> 2078.0
technical and honest

2075.599 --> 2079.44
then it would be interesting to hear if

2078.0 --> 2083.44
i got it right with this

2079.44 --> 2085.28
it's the best i got at the moment

2083.44 --> 2086.56
my honest understanding the one that'll

2085.28 --> 2089.52
stick

2086.56 --> 2091.359
because if i just quickly read up on

2089.52 --> 2093.2
technicals and then memorize it i'll

2091.359 --> 2096.3199999999997
probably forget it because

2093.2 --> 2097.839
i just want to understand it not really

2096.32 --> 2100.1600000000003
know the details as much

2097.839 --> 2101.599
i'm much more of an as a terrorist that

2100.16 --> 2105.7599999999998
way because that

2101.599 --> 2107.76
once i really get it then it that

2105.76 --> 2109.92
that insight becomes intuitive and it

2107.76 --> 2117.8390000000004
lasts forever

2109.92 --> 2117.839
or i would like to think it would

2121.05 --> 2124.179
[Music]

2127.37 --> 2131.839
[Music]

2128.839 --> 2131.839
fireworks

2137.04 --> 2142.0
all right yeah tony whitcomb well look

2139.52 --> 2142.0
huey

2142.48 --> 2151.2
qe is good he's consistent

2147.599 --> 2153.52
but when it comes to like verbal

2151.2 --> 2156.56
perfection

2153.52 --> 2156.56
he seems to be

2156.64 --> 2159.839
i don't know

2160.0 --> 2167.44
it's typical teacher by the way

2163.44 --> 2169.839
it's like he gets sloppy

2167.44 --> 2171.2000000000003
but like if you point at it then yeah

2169.839 --> 2173.68
it's basically

2171.2 --> 2175.359
annoying to him because we kind of know

2173.68 --> 2177.2799999999997
what he means

2175.359 --> 2179.44
because he's elaborate explain his

2177.28 --> 2181.8390000000004
methodology how he does that

2179.44 --> 2182.8
but then when he's like just going then

2181.839 --> 2184.32
sometimes

2182.8 --> 2187.599
he gets a little flustered and he gets

2184.32 --> 2189.28
it wrong it just says something uses the

2187.599 --> 2192.4
wrong word or whatever

2189.28 --> 2194.1600000000003
whatever he's not much of a verbal

2192.4 --> 2197.28
perfectionist

2194.16 --> 2201.839
but his understanding is very

2197.28 --> 2201.8390000000004
very consistent

2204.72 --> 2208.3999999999996
damn kids and their fireworks

2212.839 --> 2217.44
uh

2215.2 --> 2217.4399999999996
right

2221.119 --> 2227.6800000000003
but also a funny thing is you know all

2224.24 --> 2230.16
this drilling with the scientific method

2227.68 --> 2230.7999999999997
has also revealed some interesting

2230.16 --> 2234.7999999999997
things

2230.8 --> 2237.8390000000004
in general to me about how people

2234.8 --> 2237.8390000000004
deal with knowledge

2239.119 --> 2243.119
and that is that people really by

2242.079 --> 2246.5600000000004
accident

2243.119 --> 2250.0
just to be able to remember things

2246.56 --> 2252.88
reify very small details just because of

2250.0 --> 2252.88
the correlation

2253.359 --> 2258.0
and they don't like it's not up front

2256.0 --> 2258.96
it's just like the little glue that

2258.0 --> 2261.119
fills

2258.96 --> 2264.96
that glues the crystal together as it

2261.119 --> 2268.079
were the crystal of the understanding

2264.96 --> 2268.64
but it's fine it happens because there's

2268.079 --> 2272.4
like this

2268.64 --> 2272.4
interesting thing for example with

2273.44 --> 2280.0
a thing hold on

2277.92 --> 2282.4
like with the double slit and the

2280.0 --> 2286.16
knowing which path experiments

2282.4 --> 2286.8
like i have my ideas my conceptions

2286.16 --> 2290.3999999999996
about light

2286.8 --> 2292.48
right like it might not be the particle

2290.4 --> 2293.44
in the classical sense as it is made out

2292.48 --> 2294.96
to be

2293.44 --> 2296.96
i've explained why i'm not going to go

2294.96 --> 2299.359
through that all again

2296.96 --> 2300.2400000000002
gili really doesn't like that and i

2299.359 --> 2303.119
wonder sometimes

2300.24 --> 2305.359
why doesn't really address it too much

2303.119 --> 2308.119
maybe because he thinks that

2305.359 --> 2310.4
that other form of conception

2308.119 --> 2313.6800000000003
invalidates

2310.4 --> 2315.599
or suggest to invalidate like the

2313.68 --> 2316.7999999999997
experiments like the double slit and the

2315.599 --> 2319.92
knowing which path

2316.8 --> 2323.2000000000003
right like because he's

2319.92 --> 2325.76
used to people that do that try to do

2323.2 --> 2328.56
that well guess what

2325.76 --> 2329.92
i think that if those experiments really

2328.56 --> 2332.24
are real

2329.92 --> 2333.04
and i haven't seen any direct evidence

2332.24 --> 2337.04
that they're not

2333.04 --> 2340.32
just a bunch of blabbering by skeptics

2337.04 --> 2342.96
then that doesn't mean that i believe

2340.32 --> 2345.28
just because light is not that specific

2342.96 --> 2346.96
traditional idea of the particle

2345.28 --> 2348.4
that those experiments are invalid

2346.96 --> 2349.76
because if they're done

2348.4 --> 2351.44
and if they're repeatable if that

2349.76 --> 2354.4
happens then that happens

2351.44 --> 2356.96
it just might not be because of the

2354.4 --> 2356.96
reasons

2357.2 --> 2363.9199999999996
that the model of understanding

2360.96 --> 2364.64
through quantum mechanics presents on

2363.92 --> 2367.599
top of

2364.64 --> 2369.2
the raw experimental data you see

2367.599 --> 2370.7200000000003
because an experiment is just an

2369.2 --> 2371.4399999999996
experiment and the outcome is the

2370.72 --> 2374.48
outcome

2371.44 --> 2376.2400000000002
the raw data is what it is it's all

2374.48 --> 2377.44
about the conclusions and how the

2376.24 --> 2379.359
conclusions

2377.44 --> 2380.8
tie in with one another to present a

2379.359 --> 2384.3199999999997
consistent model

2380.8 --> 2386.7200000000003
of understanding you see and that is the

2384.32 --> 2389.119
glue that sometimes can lead to

2386.72 --> 2391.4399999999996
accidental reification

2389.119 --> 2393.92
to locking it into a certain type of way

2391.44 --> 2393.92
of thinking

2394.079 --> 2398.8
and that's where i'm like very carefully

2396.64 --> 2399.92
just trying to figure out like this is

2398.8 --> 2403.28
really

2399.92 --> 2406.0
it some heavy [ __ ]

2403.28 --> 2406.8
going down there and people have a lot

2406.0 --> 2410.72
of trouble

2406.8 --> 2413.52
dealing with it so they latch on to that

2410.72 --> 2415.4399999999996
glue that just makes it into it at least

2413.52 --> 2417.7599999999998
sort of consistent thing

2415.44 --> 2419.2000000000003
they latch onto that and they don't like

2417.76 --> 2422.1600000000003
when people just start to

2419.2 --> 2425.839
find tinker with the ideas of it and

2422.16 --> 2425.839
that is typically what i do

2426.88 --> 2433.28
so yeah i'm not denying the double slit

2430.64 --> 2436.839
experiment or the knowing which path

2433.28 --> 2439.8390000000004
any of that if that is

2436.839 --> 2442.24
actual data

2439.839 --> 2442.96
from the experiments then that data is

2442.24 --> 2446.319
the data

2442.96 --> 2448.16
it is what it is it what happens happens

2446.319 --> 2449.92
now the interpretation of how that

2448.16 --> 2451.2799999999997
happens

2449.92 --> 2453.359
that is where there might be some

2451.28 --> 2455.52
maneuvering room into

2453.359 --> 2457.2
yeah figuring out what is actually

2455.52 --> 2458.72
transpiring based on which

2457.2 --> 2462.0
understandings

2458.72 --> 2464.0789999999997
for example what light really is

2462.0 --> 2466.4
right and that's also probably where a

2464.079 --> 2468.5600000000004
lot of aberrant

2466.4 --> 2470.96
conceptions might leak in where suddenly

2468.56 --> 2472.64
it becomes really freaking easy too

2470.96 --> 2475.2
amazing that light is

2472.64 --> 2476.48
really freaking easy to imagine that

2475.2 --> 2479.2
light might be a wave

2476.48 --> 2480.88
because of the easiness of the modeling

2479.2 --> 2483.7599999999998
all that and that's

2480.88 --> 2484.48
one of the issues that kiwi's probably

2483.76 --> 2486.4
been just

2484.48 --> 2487.76
really snowed to death with and it's

2486.4 --> 2491.119
just

2487.76 --> 2493.92
it's yeah annoying

2491.119 --> 2495.2000000000003
that aberrations are always so

2493.92 --> 2496.96
persistent

2495.2 --> 2499.2
just like with gravity look at how

2496.96 --> 2500.4
easily it's dispelled what gravity even

2499.2 --> 2504.24
is

2500.4 --> 2507.2000000000003
yet it persists it just keeps persisting

2504.24 --> 2509.04
right people keep on trying to reify it

2507.2 --> 2511.1189999999997
anyway

2509.04 --> 2512.72
and find all kinds of ways to try and do

2511.119 --> 2515.2000000000003
it

2512.72 --> 2515.7599999999998
and i think that the same issue also is

2515.2 --> 2517.5989999999997
there with

2515.76 --> 2519.6800000000003
light being a wave i think it is the

2517.599 --> 2522.7200000000003
same level of aberration

2519.68 --> 2524.3999999999996
as i said it's is an aberration it's

2522.72 --> 2525.359
just a revocation fallacy right

2524.4 --> 2528.319
technically but

2525.359 --> 2528.319
as if as a

2528.48 --> 2535.68
consciousness phenomenon not science

2532.96 --> 2536.079
it's an aberration psychologically you

2535.68 --> 2538.96
could say

2536.079 --> 2541.119
it's an aberration aberration of

2538.96 --> 2543.839
information of ideas

2541.119 --> 2543.839
and i think that

2545.119 --> 2551.92
the light medium ether

2548.4 --> 2553.04
is also exactly in that category an

2551.92 --> 2556.079
aberration

2553.04 --> 2559.2799999999997
highly suggestive makes things easy

2556.079 --> 2560.1600000000003
but it's not actually real and then it

2559.28 --> 2561.599
mucks up

2560.16 --> 2564.0
the understanding the deeper

2561.599 --> 2568.4
understanding of the details

2564.0 --> 2572.0
because of the reification process

2568.4 --> 2574.8
right i know this might be very

2572.0 --> 2576.8
complicated to some people

2574.8 --> 2578.6400000000003
it is already kind of complicated to me

2576.8 --> 2592.88
as i'm talking about it

2578.64 --> 2595.2
might be worth re-watching that

2592.88 --> 2597.44
well mas are saline because i don't

2595.2 --> 2598.3999999999996
think light is a particle i think that

2597.44 --> 2600.319
light

2598.4 --> 2601.839
like the idea of a particle means like

2600.319 --> 2605.44
there is it's

2601.839 --> 2608.7999999999997
divisible up to a certain point and then

2605.44 --> 2609.68
if div yeah split up further it ceases

2608.8 --> 2611.8390000000004
to be

2609.68 --> 2613.44
sort of idea of you can't split it up

2611.839 --> 2616.7999999999997
you you get atomic

2613.44 --> 2619.04
on it that's the idea of the particle

2616.8 --> 2620.0
right but i think that it's not really

2619.04 --> 2623.2799999999997
that i

2620.0 --> 2626.4
think it's infinitely divisible

2623.28 --> 2628.0
it's just that we're always dependent on

2626.4 --> 2631.52
material in order to

2628.0 --> 2634.88
register it and material

2631.52 --> 2638.16
atomics well those do

2634.88 --> 2641.2000000000003
kind of seem to have

2638.16 --> 2642.319
it yeah a finite divisible nature at

2641.2 --> 2645.68
some point there is just

2642.319 --> 2650.24
an atom really has this apparent size

2645.68 --> 2652.64
and so if light is infinitely divisible

2650.24 --> 2654.72
yeah it could simply be that just not

2652.64 --> 2657.5989999999997
enough light will simply not

2654.72 --> 2658.72
cause the reaction for the specific atom

2657.599 --> 2660.88
to

2658.72 --> 2662.0
basically get to the critical mass and

2660.88 --> 2665.04
give

2662.0 --> 2667.52
a sign to the

2665.04 --> 2668.56
observer or the experimenter in order to

2667.52 --> 2671.04
register

2668.56 --> 2673.04
it's there even though there is light

2671.04 --> 2675.599
being transmitted and absorbed it's just

2673.04 --> 2679.7599999999998
not enough to cause the reaction

2675.599 --> 2679.76
right that's my conception of it

2680.24 --> 2684.0
doesn't change what it does because

2683.28 --> 2686.8
light still

2684.0 --> 2688.839
does what it does there's still the the

2686.8 --> 2691.8390000000004
diffraction

2688.839 --> 2694.0789999999997
cascade the split off

2691.839 --> 2696.319
when you shine it through slits it's

2694.079 --> 2699.28
pretty amazing how that works

2696.319 --> 2699.7599999999998
and i would suggest it suggested every

2699.28 --> 2702.0
time

2699.76 --> 2702.96
the experiments were done the data is

2702.0 --> 2705.28
there right

2702.96 --> 2706.88
oh but materials and other things

2705.28 --> 2710.8
electrons

2706.88 --> 2711.599
yeah they also do that they split up

2710.8 --> 2714.48
right right

2711.599 --> 2716.96
well no no they don't not like that they

2714.48 --> 2719.92
split up into a maximum of three

2716.96 --> 2721.76
beams and i've never seen anything

2719.92 --> 2724.16
beyond that

2721.76 --> 2725.6800000000003
right well light doesn't seem to have

2724.16 --> 2728.64
that three beam limit

2725.68 --> 2730.7999999999997
at all goes all over the place now i've

2728.64 --> 2733.44
called that difference

2730.8 --> 2735.599
i basically ascribe a phenomenon to it

2733.44 --> 2738.56
although i don't really know how to

2735.599 --> 2739.3590000000004
use it experimentally i call that

2738.56 --> 2742.0
diffraction

2739.359 --> 2743.839
cascade because it's not just regular

2742.0 --> 2746.4
diffraction it splits up

2743.839 --> 2747.92
into a few no it's a cascade it's all

2746.4 --> 2751.65
over the place

2747.92 --> 2754.829
like an explosion of split ups

2751.65 --> 2754.829
[Music]

2757.68 --> 2762.72
but i have not really studied it beyond

2761.04 --> 2766.319
that

2762.72 --> 2771.9199999999996
so is a particle physical

2766.319 --> 2771.92
what well it should be

2772.56 --> 2776.24
it depends no wait no it's not necessary

2775.28 --> 2778.8
like uh

2776.24 --> 2778.7999999999997
an atom

2779.359 --> 2784.24
or a molecule it's physical but

2785.359 --> 2791.5989999999997
an electron right

2788.4 --> 2794.7200000000003
i don't think it's just energy it's not

2791.599 --> 2795.28
it doesn't have any mass to it and

2794.72 --> 2796.9599999999996
neither

2795.28 --> 2799.76
does light i think that it's kind of

2796.96 --> 2803.44
suggested that it's supposed to do that

2799.76 --> 2806.5600000000004
i don't think so doesn't make any

2803.44 --> 2806.56
logical sense to me

2812.4 --> 2817.839
all right

2818.24 --> 2821.4399999999996
now some of these things might like

2820.24 --> 2824.7999999999997
alter the

2821.44 --> 2826.7200000000003
weight the effective weight of things

2824.8 --> 2828.8390000000004
that doesn't mean that they're adding or

2826.72 --> 2831.5989999999997
subtracting

2828.839 --> 2834.56
subtracting weight

2831.599 --> 2835.92
because they in themselves as separate

2834.56 --> 2838.56
things separate entities

2835.92 --> 2839.28
have weight like that you know i think

2838.56 --> 2842.72
that's where

2839.28 --> 2845.8390000000004
also a reification happen to

2842.72 --> 2849.7599999999998
reinforce the i the particlization of

2845.839 --> 2853.2
everything turning it all into

2849.76 --> 2856.48
atom like things give them a weight and

2853.2 --> 2858.0789999999997
say they have it in a finite divisible

2856.48 --> 2860.4
nature and suddenly you got

2858.079 --> 2862.319
a virtual particle that fits in the

2860.4 --> 2863.119
modicle of making everything into tiny

2862.319 --> 2867.68
balls

2863.119 --> 2873.839
see particlization

2867.68 --> 2873.839
of the universe

2874.95 --> 2880.3999999999996
[Music]

2877.76 --> 2883.119
with refraction over a long distance of

2880.4 --> 2883.119
body of water

2883.2 --> 2886.72
still easy as when you view through

2886.16 --> 2889.7599999999998
water

2886.72 --> 2891.04
it goes black due to density that you're

2889.76 --> 2894.079
looking through

2891.04 --> 2894.079
hope you understand

2898.839 --> 2904.0789999999997
no but look

2901.68 --> 2906.7999999999997
big bodies of water are not perfectly

2904.079 --> 2906.8
transparent

2906.96 --> 2911.44
it's way like water is way less

2909.28 --> 2913.52
transparent

2911.44 --> 2915.04
than air that's why you can see so

2913.52 --> 2919.2
freaking far in air well

2915.04 --> 2921.04
when you put on a diving goggles

2919.2 --> 2922.48
and you go in the water yeah you can see

2921.04 --> 2925.599
some distance but not

2922.48 --> 2929.119
as far by a long shot because

2925.599 --> 2930.8
yeah light is somewhat transparent

2929.119 --> 2932.2400000000002
but when you have a lot of it then it

2930.8 --> 2937.28
just absorbs the light

2932.24 --> 2939.04
too so that greatly limits the sight

2937.28 --> 2943.0400000000004
that's why it seems that when you look

2939.04 --> 2946.079
on a big body of water it's just dark

2943.04 --> 2948.48
further you go away from the coast and

2946.079 --> 2949.44
the ocean becomes deeper the more that

2948.48 --> 2952.0
happens it just

2949.44 --> 2953.04
becomes darker because yeah the light is

2952.0 --> 2955.2
not reaching this

2953.04 --> 2956.48
the the bottom anymore in order to

2955.2 --> 2961.68
reflect back

2956.48 --> 2961.68
for you to see that somewhat lighting up

2967.599 --> 2971.839
all right mother salim no more questions

2969.599 --> 2971.839
okay

2972.24 --> 2985.839
it's good questions i really like that

2988.16 --> 2992.8799999999997
right i hope i explained that

2993.119 --> 2998.0
well enough for you to understand tony

2996.839 --> 3001.2799999999997
whitcomb

2998.0 --> 3004.96
about like like why you see

3001.28 --> 3007.599
why the oceans seem darker

3004.96 --> 3010.64
than just a an aquarium full of water

3007.599 --> 3010.6400000000003
through which you can look

3010.839 --> 3013.839
easily

3017.68 --> 3020.96
light isn't infinite

3025.119 --> 3029.2000000000003
i don't know isn't it

3031.119 --> 3034.4
i don't know mazar slim like what does

3033.68 --> 3037.2799999999997
that mean

3034.4 --> 3038.319
i think that light could technically

3037.28 --> 3040.8
potentially

3038.319 --> 3043.44
reach forever if there was just the

3040.8 --> 3045.52
perfect vacuum through which it would go

3043.44 --> 3046.7200000000003
because there would be nothing to absorb

3045.52 --> 3048.8
it

3046.72 --> 3050.16
no matter the distance and then it would

3048.8 --> 3053.04
be

3050.16 --> 3054.319
just traveling however long that vacuum

3053.04 --> 3058.079
would be but that's of course

3054.319 --> 3060.5589999999997
extremely hypothetical or

3058.079 --> 3061.44
almost yeah impossible to truly

3060.559 --> 3063.6800000000003
demonstrate

3061.44 --> 3066.839
because you're not gonna have a vacuum

3063.68 --> 3068.48
chamber that is forever length that's

3066.839 --> 3072.0
ridiculous

3068.48 --> 3073.839
but yeah everything all matter including

3072.0 --> 3076.839
gas

3073.839 --> 3078.16
or even not so much gas like

3076.839 --> 3081.52
depressurized

3078.16 --> 3084.319
situation it does absorb light

3081.52 --> 3084.319
over distance

3090.24 --> 3095.5989999999997
right mother slim it would depend on the

3092.4 --> 3099.6800000000003
medium it's traveling through

3095.599 --> 3099.6800000000003
what any medium any matter

3100.0 --> 3106.4
even transparent will absorb

3103.2 --> 3106.8799999999997
yeah microscopic microscope i don't know

3106.4 --> 3110.079
how much

3106.88 --> 3110.6400000000003
will absorb some of the light even if

3110.079 --> 3115.28
just

3110.64 --> 3118.5589999999997
microscopic amounts like way below

3115.28 --> 3120.7200000000003
the yeah

3118.559 --> 3122.48
of the yeah that's that's where the the

3120.72 --> 3126.0789999999997
particle idea of light

3122.48 --> 3129.28
the finite sized energy amount

3126.079 --> 3132.0
again beget becomes like illogical

3129.28 --> 3133.8390000000004
because if a medium is transparent

3132.0 --> 3135.599
enough

3133.839 --> 3137.52
that almost no light will be absorbed

3135.599 --> 3139.599
there still will be just this amount of

3137.52 --> 3141.599
light absorbed but how does it absorb it

3139.599 --> 3145.119
then if

3141.599 --> 3147.839
the matter like will not absorb

3145.119 --> 3149.44
enough for a single light particle to

3147.839 --> 3151.68
basically be absorbed see that

3149.44 --> 3152.559
again that makes no sense the finite

3151.68 --> 3156.319
size

3152.559 --> 3157.52
of light for interaction for it to be

3156.319 --> 3161.52
this particle it just

3157.52 --> 3161.52
doesn't make mechanical sense

3161.76 --> 3165.0400000000004
now if it's infinitely divisible then

3164.559 --> 3168.96
yes

3165.04 --> 3172.48
any amount of transparency even

3168.96 --> 3175.52
very very high will just

3172.48 --> 3178.16
result into microscopic amounts of

3175.52 --> 3179.359
light being absorbed by it very

3178.16 --> 3183.1189999999997
gradually over

3179.359 --> 3184.64
fast fast distances see and then it

3183.119 --> 3187.599
works out perfectly

3184.64 --> 3187.5989999999997
perfectly

3192.839 --> 3197.139
mechanically

3194.03 --> 3197.139
[Music]

3199.49 --> 3203.68
[Music]

3206.839 --> 3210.72
so

3209.119 --> 3212.96
i don't know if you're getting the same

3210.72 --> 3223.839
sense of that

3212.96 --> 3223.839
to me it's just it fixes so much

3261.68 --> 3265.839
that's already two o'clock

3266.8 --> 3272.1600000000003
oh i got some buns i almost forgot

3269.839 --> 3274.7999999999997
i forgot them for an hour damn this

3272.16 --> 3274.7999999999997
should be cool

3276.839 --> 3279.839
probably

3312.079 --> 3316.7200000000003
oh well cold is better than nothing

3316.88 --> 3321.839
through a vacuum

3321.84 --> 3335.839
[Music]

3325.76 --> 3335.8390000000004
hey voynich

3346.839 --> 3349.839
so

3367.76 --> 3379.2000000000003
so anymore for any more

3376.05 --> 3381.8390000000004
[Music]

3379.2 --> 3384.8799999999997
i like the level of the question so far

3381.839 --> 3388.0
it doesn't have to be to that level

3384.88 --> 3392.2400000000002
if you don't want to maybe you've

3388.0 --> 3397.76
already got enough hyper focused

3392.24 --> 3397.7599999999998
stuff now to think about anything else

3398.48 --> 3405.839
anything i should know about

3408.16 --> 3412.16
question about aliens okay

3413.28 --> 3419.8390000000004
where did i miss it

3420.079 --> 3423.599
all right yeah yeah i see it now in the

3422.88 --> 3425.92
west here

3423.599 --> 3428.4
the media which i don't believe ever is

3425.92 --> 3432.7200000000003
focusing hard on speech aliens

3428.4 --> 3435.599
my question to you is is the netherlands

3432.72 --> 3438.16
news pushing space alien stuff i don't

3435.599 --> 3438.1600000000003
think so

3438.559 --> 3441.599
i've not seen it

3443.04 --> 3449.2
but then again i rarely watch

3446.559 --> 3452.0
mainstream news in the netherlands like

3449.2 --> 3452.0
very rarely

3456.48 --> 3458.72
oh

3460.4 --> 3465.52
gravy based biofuel yeah it's

3465.68 --> 3472.0789999999997
it's just more play on words with gravy

3468.96 --> 3474.96
and gravy is like what

3472.079 --> 3475.44
oh yeah owen benjamin when he's like on

3474.96 --> 3477.76
a roll

3475.44 --> 3480.64
when it's really funny or really intense

3477.76 --> 3483.92
or interdimensional thinking again

3480.64 --> 3488.319
which i do regularly by myself

3483.92 --> 3490.64
also then they call that gravy

3488.319 --> 3493.599
so i was just thinking like yeah gravy

3490.64 --> 3493.5989999999997
based biofuel

3494.48 --> 3497.839
you understand gravy good

3498.4 --> 3502.1600000000003
well the thing is like cooking fats and

3501.599 --> 3506.0
oil

3502.16 --> 3510.799
can literally be made into biofuel

3506.0 --> 3510.799
so i was thinking gravy-based biofuels

3512.64 --> 3518.16
right because biofuel yeah it's like a

3516.16 --> 3521.5989999999997
play on words

3518.16 --> 3526.0789999999997
you have the literal industrial

3521.599 --> 3529.2000000000003
like things your car can run on

3526.079 --> 3531.6800000000003
diesel biofuel diesel

3529.2 --> 3532.64
but you could also say bio fuel is like

3531.68 --> 3535.68
the thing that

3532.64 --> 3536.0
you need to keep your morale up and keep

3535.68 --> 3545.839
you

3536.0 --> 3545.839
active biofuel see

3553.92 --> 3556.7200000000003
ellipsoid

3557.76 --> 3560.3190000000004
okay

3562.079 --> 3573.8390000000004
i know flat side

3583.119 --> 3601.839
predictive text okay

3586.96 --> 3601.839
i don't know what that means but

3612.839 --> 3615.839
so

3626.839 --> 3629.839
hmm

3632.559 --> 3635.6800000000003
synthetic oil

3636.72 --> 3641.1189999999997
how is that you mean like substances go

3639.599 --> 3646.1600000000003
through a refinery and then

3641.119 --> 3646.1600000000003
oil comes out or is it just fermented

3654.72 --> 3660.24
because look abiotic oil which is like

3658.559 --> 3662.799
oil well oil

3660.24 --> 3664.0789999999997
it is basically a natural process it's

3662.799 --> 3668.4
bacteria

3664.079 --> 3672.96
very specific weird deep earth bacteria

3668.4 --> 3676.48
under high pressure consume the rock

3672.96 --> 3678.799
and turn it into abiotic oil so yeah

3676.48 --> 3683.599
that can absolutely be emulated

3678.799 --> 3685.839
and industrialized by humans of course

3683.599 --> 3685.839
why not

3687.19 --> 3692.16
[Music]

3690.0 --> 3698.14
don't know if they should though there's

3692.16 --> 3701.2999999999997
already plenty of that stuff around

3698.14 --> 3701.2999999999997
[Music]

3709.839 --> 3713.2
how they make it but it's the same stuff

3711.599 --> 3715.119
as we drill for well then

3713.2 --> 3716.5589999999997
then they that's already happening then

3715.119 --> 3717.52
then they literally just took the

3716.559 --> 3721.039
bacteria

3717.52 --> 3723.119
put it into a giant pressure can factory

3721.039 --> 3725.039
in which they pour the right materials

3723.119 --> 3726.559
that are ideal for those bacteria to

3725.039 --> 3728.6400000000003
consume under that high pressure and

3726.559 --> 3741.2000000000003
then they create oil

3728.64 --> 3744.5589999999997
so they've just industrialized it then

3741.2 --> 3747.5989999999997
all they'd need is a

3744.559 --> 3750.0
living specimen of that bacteria and

3747.599 --> 3754.4
then cultivate it

3750.0 --> 3758.16
and then yeah insert that into the

3754.4 --> 3769.839
pressurized oil breeding plant yeah

3758.16 --> 3769.839
makes perfect sense

3775.06 --> 3782.04
[Music]

3794.839 --> 3797.839
one

3799.44 --> 3803.52
humans will be the batteries of the

3801.119 --> 3806.2400000000002
future just like in the matrix

3803.52 --> 3806.24
yeah no

3806.96 --> 3811.2
yes and no electricity absolutely

3810.24 --> 3814.24
ridiculous

3811.2 --> 3817.9199999999996
we are receivers of electricity

3814.24 --> 3817.9199999999996
now when it comes to actually

3818.799 --> 3826.0
survival creativity

3822.0 --> 3830.24
development yes without humans

3826.0 --> 3833.92
nothing else is going to be

3830.24 --> 3837.1189999999997
surviving out there at this point

3833.92 --> 3840.079
computers can't survive without humans

3837.119 --> 3840.88
so they can try to contain them but they

3840.079 --> 3844.48
will always

3840.88 --> 3846.2400000000002
need them always the idea this fantasy

3844.48 --> 3849.2
that computers can be completely

3846.24 --> 3853.839
self-maintaining sustaining

3849.2 --> 3853.839
is highly flawed illogical

3855.2 --> 3858.319
because computers

3859.92 --> 3865.76
can't really repair themselves

3863.92 --> 3868.96
and when things go like computers aren't

3865.76 --> 3874.079
typically good at predicting

3868.96 --> 3876.2400000000002
when what will break about themselves

3874.079 --> 3878.0
and once that happens a human needs to

3876.24 --> 3881.839
intervene

3878.0 --> 3881.839
figure it out and fix it

3883.119 --> 3889.6800000000003
yeah it just doesn't work

3886.559 --> 3892.8390000000004
computers no matter how brilliant

3889.68 --> 3895.839
and quick they are we'll always need

3892.839 --> 3895.839
humans

3902.96 --> 3909.839
who outputs a lot of energy that's

3906.839 --> 3909.839
ridiculous

3919.599 --> 3924.319
uh that's the cause of lightning

3925.68 --> 3937.839
isn't it basically friction

3939.76 --> 3942.0
right

3945.359 --> 3949.119
right negative and positive charge due

3947.359 --> 3953.359
to friction

open your mind uh yeah

3955.119 --> 3960.2400000000002
yeah i'm not gonna open my mind to

3956.96 --> 3960.2400000000002

turn it into a metaphor and say the the

3988.96 --> 3992.4
need

3989.359 --> 3995.359
are the batteries yeah

you were trying to do

4032.839 --> 4035.839

4056.079 --> 4060.96
now tony whitcomb has absolutely nothing

4059.119 --> 4065.6800000000003
to do with ai

4060.96 --> 4068.16
not so it's simply

4065.68 --> 4068.16
modeling

4069.599 --> 4075.599
humans with high technological insight

4073.359 --> 4077.7599999999998
just figured out the structure of it the

4075.599 --> 4079.52
pathway

4077.76 --> 4081.8390000000004
they got fractal line inside and they

4079.52 --> 4084.48
used it to

4081.839 --> 4086.24
improve the technology to just

4084.48 --> 4086.799
unbelievable levels and they could have

4086.24 --> 4089.4399999999996
jumped

4086.799 --> 4091.0389999999998
almost right away to the end they just

4089.44 --> 4093.2000000000003
didn't do that they

4091.039 --> 4096.64
went for a gradual development in order

4093.2 --> 4096.639999999999
for people to adapt

4098.159 --> 4102.0
because they could have had just

4099.52 --> 4103.120000000001
mind-blowing computer technology even in

4102.0 --> 4106.08
the 90s just

4103.12 --> 4107.3589999999995
mind-blowing powerful like way beyond

4106.08 --> 4110.4
what we got

4107.359 --> 4110.400000000001
they didn't do that

4111.679 --> 4117.679
right it's just that technology

4114.96 --> 4119.12
is usually not graduating growth at some

4117.679 --> 4122.159
point

4119.12 --> 4125.92
somebody finds just this

4122.159 --> 4128.639999999999
this vat of power opens it up and then

4125.92 --> 4130.56
radically everything changes one way or

4128.64 --> 4132.88
the other and depending on how much is

4130.56 --> 4135.279
unleashed on the world

4132.88 --> 4137.04
egos will grow out of control fears and

4135.279 --> 4140.88
[ __ ] and then wars

4137.04 --> 4140.88
if it's too much all at the same time

4143.12 --> 4147.12
because yeah that's what happens when

4144.719 --> 4150.08
just power is unleashed

4147.12 --> 4151.44
upon the consciousness of people you

4150.08 --> 4152.64
know things are figured out and

4151.44 --> 4156.0
technologies

4152.64 --> 4158.88
become possible and then when yeah when

4156.0 --> 4161.56
the rulers allow that to happen

4158.88 --> 4164.609
it just changes everything

4170.0 --> 4177.279
well pandora's box

maybe i don't know if that's the best

4177.279 --> 4180.0
example

4178.08 --> 4182.88
because these things just happen is it a

4180.0 --> 4185.92
pandora's box

4182.88 --> 4187.04
well any power you unleash is going to

4185.92 --> 4189.679
have

4187.04 --> 4190.88
good alterations things that can be

4189.679 --> 4194.159
learned from

4190.88 --> 4198.32
and bad alterations more addictions

4194.159 --> 4201.92
more yeah more applications to escape

4198.32 --> 4204.0
from reality both it's always the same

4201.92 --> 4206.2390000000005
so to call it a pandora's box like it's

4204.0 --> 4207.92
just doom only i don't i don't agree

it's just power it's just new

4212.4 --> 4217.839999999999
possibilities for good and for bad

4226.88 --> 4234.32
that's a cause of energy

4230.159 --> 4234.32
i don't know god

4238.32 --> 4242.32
i don't know with what i've seen from

4242.4 --> 4247.199
john these videos recently his new

4245.199 --> 4249.5199999999995
series i'd say that energy is

4247.199 --> 4251.12
is a reification it's actually just a

4249.52 --> 4259.84
concept

4251.12 --> 4259.84
to tie in a easier understanding

4260.08 --> 4263.199
of well of energy

4264.0 --> 4268.96
yeah of several mechanical

4269.12 --> 4275.76
transmuting or physical nature altering

4273.12 --> 4277.92
processes

4275.76 --> 4279.360000000001
that do kind of translate into one

4277.92 --> 4282.4
another but

4279.36 --> 4285.44
yeah what is the energy

4282.4 --> 4286.639999999999
right yeah so that's it's new to me i

4285.44 --> 4288.32
just

4286.64 --> 4291.679
still need to think about that can't

4288.32 --> 4291.679
really elaborate too much

4292.4 --> 4298.48
country comes in a lot of forms right

4295.44 --> 4301.599999999999
what is it really

4298.48 --> 4305.04
or is it just calculably

4301.6 --> 4308.2390000000005
the same but is it really the same

4305.04 --> 4311.199
yeah how do you prove that that's where

4308.239 --> 4313.12
john d's new video series is basically

4311.199 --> 4316.0
stepping in

4313.12 --> 4318.62
and trying something and yeah i'm i'm

4316.0 --> 4321.779
gonna keep track of it it's interesting

4318.62 --> 4321.7789999999995
[Music]

4325.44 --> 4329.839999999999
hey robin sammy good morning

4340.84 --> 4343.84
what

4350.8 --> 4355.28
a link to this john d i'm speaking as

4352.96 --> 4355.28
sure

4355.44 --> 4357.839999999999
hold on

4370.32 --> 4375.599999999999
right okay hey

4376.08 --> 4379.12
go to part one

4380.88 --> 4384.32
well i haven't even finished at all i

4382.88 --> 4386.88
think

4384.32 --> 4386.88
no i did

4387.679 --> 4399.84
okay so this is part one there's already

4390.08 --> 4399.84
a part two out

4403.37 --> 4406.949
[Music]

4409.24 --> 4415.199
[Music]

4411.199 --> 4427.839999999999
hmm part 2 is good i haven't seen it yet

4415.199 --> 4427.839999999999
so i don't know

4457.79 --> 4464.039
[Music]

4469.16 --> 4472.3

4480.239 --> 4484.32
what came for supernatural physical

4494.84 --> 4497.84
supernatural

4508.84 --> 4511.84

4522.84 --> 4525.84
hmm

4531.24 --> 4534.3099999999995

4536.84 --> 4539.84

4550.52 --> 4555.280000000001
thank

4552.91 --> 4558.0
[Music]

4555.28 --> 4567.84
sorry for me just eating here i just

4558.0 --> 4567.84
needed a chow or something

4573.52 --> 4581.84
[Music]

4575.76 --> 4581.84
oh more of these uh

4583.28 --> 4588.88
it kind of define depends on how you

4585.76 --> 4588.88
define the mind

4589.44 --> 4595.839999999999
but if that includes spirit then i'd say

4592.88 --> 4595.84
mind

4600.48 --> 4609.839999999999
uh jason mccormack really

4612.8 --> 4616.64
i think my address is kind of public

4618.159 --> 4623.839999999999
isn't it

4628.239 --> 4633.199
with the ice crystals it is kind of

4630.64 --> 4636.96
proven that

4633.199 --> 4640.08
well it's considered pseudoscience right

4636.96 --> 4643.44
although yeah i don't know man but dr

4640.08 --> 4648.08
emoto figured out

4643.44 --> 4648.08
that certain intentions and music even

4648.159 --> 4653.28
subjected to water and then the water

4651.6 --> 4656.56
yeah letting the water freeze would

4653.28 --> 4658.88
result in different type of ice crystals

4656.56 --> 4660.8
very distinct patterns that would come

4658.88 --> 4663.12
out of it like chaotic patterns in

4660.8 --> 4667.04
aggressive and

4663.12 --> 4667.92
angry vibrations and intentions and

4667.04 --> 4672.48
words even

4667.92 --> 4675.679
and the opposite with like peace and

4672.48 --> 4678.5599999999995
like happy things

4675.679 --> 4681.12
would become very very symmetrical

4678.56 --> 4681.120000000001
patterns

4681.52 --> 4688.320000000001
so maybe there is a standard

4685.12 --> 4690.64
intention or energy going around just

4688.32 --> 4691.599999999999
there at all times a very subtle thing

4690.64 --> 4695.1990000000005
this is

4691.6 --> 4700.719
speculation that would basically allow

4695.199 --> 4703.759999999999
ice crystals to form exactly as they do

4700.719 --> 4707.28
like that's the standard intention or

4703.76 --> 4710.320000000001
something but yeah this is kind of

4707.28 --> 4713.5199999999995
wild speculation of course based on

4710.32 --> 4713.5199999999995
dr emoto's work

4713.76 --> 4717.52
maybe there's like this baseline godly

4716.56 --> 4720.0
intention

4717.52 --> 4721.6
like because of god's attention on the

4720.0 --> 4724.32
world

4721.6 --> 4725.92
that that causes ice crystal per default

4724.32 --> 4730.32
to crystallize as they do

4725.92 --> 4732.8
naturally unless there is something else

4730.32 --> 4734.4
causing another intention specifically

4732.8 --> 4749.84
by humans see

4734.4 --> 4749.839999999999
it's just a train of thought

4752.0 --> 4758.0
what sucker punch i don't care

4755.6 --> 4760.88
people can know where i live i've i've

4758.0 --> 4763.92
given out my address and everything

4760.88 --> 4777.41
everybody knows where i am okay it's not

4763.92 --> 4780.58
a secret

4777.41 --> 4780.58
[Music]

4788.84 --> 4791.84
so

4802.84 --> 4805.84
so

4811.36 --> 4818.0
well de la fila elfinor

4814.96 --> 4821.76
yeah i understand that the

4818.0 --> 4821.76
frequencies in the 5g but

4824.239 --> 4830.638999999999
look most people already have effective

4827.44 --> 4833.919999999999
5g like in their living rooms

4830.639 --> 4837.52
a lot of routers wi-fi like

4833.92 --> 4840.2390000000005
wi-fi technology it's almost

4837.52 --> 4840.96
exactly like 5g it's the same type of

4840.239 --> 4844.839999999999
signal

4840.96 --> 4848.88
frequency and all that so

4844.84 --> 4850.8
yeah if you've been living with that

4848.88 --> 4853.1990000000005
and you're perfectly fine you don't have

4850.8 --> 4854.320000000001
regular anxiety or sleepless nights

4853.199 --> 4858.719
because of that

4854.32 --> 4858.719
then i wouldn't worry too much about 5g

4858.84 --> 4861.84
myself

4862.96 --> 4867.28
it does have an influence it will

4865.04 --> 4870.8
probably have a long-term

4867.28 --> 4872.32
slow deterioration effect but i don't

4870.8 --> 4876.0
think it's all that acute

4872.32 --> 4879.92
now technologically it could be

4876.0 --> 4883.199
if the device that does this is

4879.92 --> 4885.679
suddenly weaponized or like

4883.199 --> 4886.719
hacked in and then made to have extreme

4885.679 --> 4888.719
output

4886.719 --> 4891.199
in a specific way yeah it can be used as

4888.719 --> 4894.2390000000005
a weapon it always had been

4891.199 --> 4898.08
does it mean it is right that's

4894.239 --> 4901.12
the difficult part can it be yeah is it

4898.08 --> 4903.199
i don't think so there's not like

4901.12 --> 4904.8
just people suddenly dropping dead

4903.199 --> 4907.12
everywhere

4904.8 --> 4907.92
like that just like that could still be

4907.12 --> 4910.88
i don't know

4907.92 --> 4911.679
yeah oh could be would be is it we don't

4910.88 --> 4913.28
know

4911.679 --> 4916.08
are we gonna assume it then it's gonna

4913.28 --> 4919.12
make your life incredibly miserable

4916.08 --> 4921.36
so it's kind of up to you to

4919.12 --> 4924.96
see how to deal with it i've been trying

4921.36 --> 4927.839999999999
to stay away from wireless

4924.96 --> 4927.84
yeah for over

4928.239 --> 4934.32
for over 12 years because it had been

4931.679 --> 4934.32
bothering me

4934.639 --> 4939.36
like when i was in a room where there's

4937.36 --> 4941.839999999999
just wireless [ __ ] everywhere eventually

4939.36 --> 4945.199
i would start to feel like i was choking

4941.84 --> 4947.84
like i can't get any air and then

4945.199 --> 4949.04
i'm at the open window breathing fresh

4947.84 --> 4950.639
air and it's still not

4949.04 --> 4952.8
i'm not getting any fresh air what is

4950.639 --> 4954.2390000000005
this i would really have to walk away

4952.8 --> 4958.320000000001
from there

4954.239 --> 4958.799999999999
over a distance to the balcony somewhere

4958.32 --> 4962.0
else

4958.8 --> 4965.679
in order to get actual relief

4962.0 --> 4968.4
that that was my experience with that

4965.679 --> 4970.0
you can call that nonsense or whatever i

4968.4 --> 4972.96
don't give a flying

4970.0 --> 4975.44
[ __ ] if you don't like that i've

4972.96 --> 4979.28
experienced that

4975.44 --> 4981.36
and i don't give a [ __ ] it just happens

4979.28 --> 4983.36
don't have to think about oh i'm walking

4981.36 --> 4985.599999999999
into a room with the wireless

4983.36 --> 4988.4
no i just start to notice like i feel

4985.6 --> 4989.84
like i can't breathe properly

4988.4 --> 4992.32
and then i just look around like how

4989.84 --> 4995.679
many freaking wireless [ __ ] is here

4992.32 --> 4998.0
yeah yeah that happens to me

4995.679 --> 4999.12
i don't give a flying [ __ ] if you

4998.0 --> 5001.28
believe

4999.12 --> 5003.28
that it's imagined or not at whatever

5001.28 --> 5005.599999999999
[ __ ] conclusion you're gonna draw

5003.28 --> 5007.28
you wanna drown yourself in freaking

5005.6 --> 5010.639
wi-fi all day long

5007.28 --> 5015.84
you go ahead go ahead

5010.639 --> 5015.84
just keep the [ __ ] away from me

5023.13 --> 5026.3
[Music]

5030.4 --> 5033.599999999999
bees are death you know what i don't

5032.32 --> 5036.32
know

5033.6 --> 5036.320000000001
where's the proof

5039.199 --> 5044.96
i know that the the overall street like

5042.32 --> 5048.719
it does give stress it disorients

5044.96 --> 5048.719
doesn't mean they all instantly die

5049.04 --> 5053.35
it's really the combination of pesticide

5052.32 --> 5055.28
use

5053.35 --> 5058.320000000001
[Music]

5055.28 --> 5060.4
and that includes gmo stuff and

5058.32 --> 5062.48
wireless in general but that's not

5060.4 --> 5067.12
necessarily even the 5g tower

5062.48 --> 5070.159
like 4g reaches further

5067.12 --> 5073.12
that also has problematic effects right

5070.159 --> 5075.5199999999995
5gs don't have that much reach that's

5073.12 --> 5078.5599999999995
the thing about 5g it's

5075.52 --> 5079.360000000001
short range that's how the technology

5078.56 --> 5085.84
works

5079.36 --> 5085.839999999999
it's different

5092.08 --> 5100.48
why are you bringing that up turret 306

5095.36 --> 5100.48
come on what kind of it's come on dude

5105.84 --> 5110.84
why would you even put freaking question

5107.84 --> 5114.719
marks behind it that's just like

5110.84 --> 5117.28
what you think there's anybody in the

5114.719 --> 5119.52
freaking world

5117.28 --> 5121.28
that still honestly believe that there

5119.52 --> 5121.84
is some kind of potential good coming

5121.28 --> 5127.12
out of that

5121.84 --> 5130.400000000001
at all besides the just almost suicidal

5127.12 --> 5141.84
doubling down crazy people kind of a

5130.4 --> 5141.839999999999
question is that

5152.84 --> 5155.84
ugh

5162.88 --> 5169.84
okay mother slim

5170.0 --> 5177.6
grand why am i so grand

5174.159 --> 5178.719
i basically identify as a wizard and

5177.6 --> 5182.96
that's not a

5178.719 --> 5186.08
gender thing right that's a class

5182.96 --> 5190.639
that's my that's my class it's

5186.08 --> 5197.04
d and d right what i do

5190.639 --> 5198.639
a grand wizard come on

5197.04 --> 5211.76
i don't know maybe in 30 years or

5198.639 --> 5214.4800000000005
something if i'm still around

5211.76 --> 5214.96
yes exactly robin stanley now that's a

5214.48 --> 5217.599999999999
good one

5214.96 --> 5218.8
safe and effective yeah it's going to be

5217.6 --> 5220.639
safe

5218.8 --> 5223.360000000001
for people that don't take the vaccine

5220.639 --> 5224.8
because the symptoms will only happen to

5223.36 --> 5228.0
the people that take it

5224.8 --> 5229.04
they might die and in that sense it's

5228.0 --> 5231.36
effective

5229.04 --> 5234.0
because that's exactly the effect that

5231.36 --> 5236.159
the makers of the vaccines intended

5234.0 --> 5238.719
to not actually spread an auto control

5236.159 --> 5242.08
disease but just to

5238.719 --> 5245.44
basically damage or euthanize dupes

5242.08 --> 5252.4
so yeah safe and effective indeed

5245.44 --> 5254.96
this is ooh aroma sunstone that's

5252.4 --> 5257.679
you do realize that merlin identifies

5254.96 --> 5260.96
himself as a necromancer right

5257.679 --> 5264.84
this is i don't know if you caught

5260.96 --> 5266.3
if you picked up on that little detail

5264.84 --> 5269.409000000001
uh

5266.3 --> 5269.409000000001
[Music]

5277.84 --> 5281.52
oh right yeah you said that i didn't see

5280.48 --> 5284.638999999999
that yet

5281.52 --> 5284.639
i ran sunstone

5286.08 --> 5290.0
right but look a necromancer is

5288.239 --> 5292.5599999999995
basically somebody

5290.0 --> 5294.32
i you know what does it mean what does

5292.56 --> 5296.159000000001
it mean literally

5294.32 --> 5298.88
well it might mean that he simply

5296.159 --> 5301.28
dabbles in matters of life and death

5298.88 --> 5302.32
have you ever considered that because he

5301.28 --> 5305.679
does do that

5302.32 --> 5307.679
like he does do radical even dangerous

5305.679 --> 5310.719
actions

5307.679 --> 5312.88
to shape the future

5310.719 --> 5315.92
that's what he's doing there that's what

5312.88 --> 5315.92
he did with arthur

5317.199 --> 5323.839999999999
took him away from his dad who was

5319.44 --> 5323.839999999999
radically out of control

5324.48 --> 5330.718999999999
to secure a future king and yeah you

5328.32 --> 5332.239
could consider that necromancy because

5330.719 --> 5335.679
he was literally just

5332.239 --> 5338.0
changing lives and yeah

5335.679 --> 5339.679
the dad died soon after because he

5338.0 --> 5342.239
couldn't handle that

5339.679 --> 5344.4
that thing that he basically decided

5342.239 --> 5348.239
upon

5344.4 --> 5350.799999999999
using the agreements and all that right

5348.239 --> 5352.239
is that necromancy is that what he meant

5350.8 --> 5354.88
with necromancy

5352.239 --> 5357.5199999999995
because later remember in the movie when

5354.88 --> 5360.159000000001
morgana

5357.52 --> 5362.2390000000005
like tried to grab the power as it were

5360.159 --> 5366.159
before that you said like yeah you're

5362.239 --> 5369.28
dealing with newts and

5366.159 --> 5372.5599999999995
lizards like look at what you're doing

5369.28 --> 5375.759999999999
so that's like why you know

5372.56 --> 5379.84
is necromancy what you think it is in

5375.76 --> 5379.84
the way that he used the word

5381.36 --> 5384.32
it's complicated

5384.48 --> 5389.678999999999
right and besides some

5387.52 --> 5391.76
little weird little detail in in the

5389.679 --> 5393.36
dungeons and dragons universe at least

5391.76 --> 5394.639
so it doesn't necessarily have to be in

5393.36 --> 5397.92
the same

5394.639 --> 5402.719
tradition as what the movie taps into

5397.92 --> 5406.159
necromancy is also healing magic

5402.719 --> 5407.36
can take life and can give life and it's

5406.159 --> 5409.5199999999995
not necessarily like

5407.36 --> 5410.88
oh you give life that always means that

5409.52 --> 5414.88
that also takes away

5410.88 --> 5414.88
life right not like that

5416.239 --> 5421.839999999999
so yeah i don't know so many ways to

5419.28 --> 5421.84
look at it

5421.92 --> 5429.84
yeah right morgana in the movie

5426.08 --> 5433.12
had no objections to just defile

5429.84 --> 5434.0
everything for pure power for pure petty

5433.12 --> 5437.84
temporary power

5434.0 --> 5437.84
that became very obvious

5438.56 --> 5444.88
well merlin was did actually have

5441.84 --> 5448.400000000001
feelings he was not a psychopath

5444.88 --> 5450.88
he had underwent punishment

5448.4 --> 5451.679
as he called it like the punishment from

5450.88 --> 5454.88
the dragon

5451.679 --> 5458.2390000000005
for his actions it's his consciousness

5454.88 --> 5463.84
this is how god works so that was

5458.239 --> 5463.839999999999
extremely interesting to me in the movie

5469.36 --> 5473.28
all right see you later jason ah hashtag

5472.239 --> 5477.839999999999
mifa

5473.28 --> 5477.84
all right cool

5478.32 --> 5505.84
nice stallion 8012 yeah i'm doing great

5491.36 --> 5505.839999999999
i got 15 more minutes at least

5506.8 --> 5509.360000000001
oh god

5510.159 --> 5515.04
there's so many kids out there like

5512.96 --> 5517.44
screwing around with fireworks and like

5515.04 --> 5519.36
like as soon as like that second half of

5517.44 --> 5521.5199999999995
december starts

5519.36 --> 5523.44
it's like almost constantly and then

5521.52 --> 5526.88
like the last week it's gonna go

5523.44 --> 5529.599999999999
nuts like people are just gonna fire off

5526.88 --> 5533.1990000000005
heavy fireworks like every hour

5529.6 --> 5534.719
maybe hopefully not at night it happens

5533.199 --> 5536.5599999999995
in the middle of the night they do it

5534.719 --> 5539.92
sometimes in the middle of the week it's

5536.56 --> 5542.639
people it's weird it's it's

5539.92 --> 5542.639
the netherlands

5544.159 --> 5549.839999999999
but then yeah the last the last two days

5547.52 --> 5553.1990000000005
it's just gonna be

5549.84 --> 5553.1990000000005
absolute war zone

5554.88 --> 5562.2390000000005
but luckily usually after that like

5558.84 --> 5565.76
when the first of january

5562.239 --> 5569.04
when it's light again then it kind of

5565.76 --> 5572.159000000001
dies down and then after like

5569.04 --> 5573.679
two or three days it does eventually

5572.159 --> 5575.839999999999
just stop

5573.679 --> 5578.4
they don't keep on doing that [ __ ] for

5575.84 --> 5589.84
like another week or something at least

5578.4 --> 5589.839999999999
does just stop after a while

5593.36 --> 5598.5599999999995
hmm okay robin stanley

5596.719 --> 5600.4
i may be picking up on some weird

5598.56 --> 5604.88
frequencies there

5600.4 --> 5604.879999999999
i grew up with asbestos lead everywhere

5606.8 --> 5617.84
that's not good

5628.84 --> 5631.84
wait

5634.48 --> 5645.839999999999
be right back

5670.84 --> 5673.84
so

5698.84 --> 5701.84
so

5740.08 --> 5743.84
and i'm back

5753.84 --> 5770.719
that was weird

5757.84 --> 5785.84
just smells like ionized air

5770.719 --> 5785.84
huh that's so weird

5787.679 --> 5799.84
done what i can to detoxify so far

5790.88 --> 5799.84
from free ramifications uh

5810.84 --> 5813.84
so

5818.719 --> 5827.84
you think that is air you're breathing

5821.76 --> 5827.84
that's funny

5838.84 --> 5841.84
hmm

5844.08 --> 5855.84
sunshine and fireworks out and about

5847.199 --> 5855.839999999999
it's just kids

5859.36 --> 5861.679
ah

5863.92 --> 5869.84
so odd i can just smell this

5872.159 --> 5876.799999999999
because like my air system which yeah i

5875.84 --> 5879.360000000001
still don't

5876.8 --> 5879.360000000001
really have

5879.84 --> 5885.92
although i'm surviving without it

5883.28 --> 5888.8
yeah it used to do that and i kind of

5885.92 --> 5897.84
missed the smell sometimes

5888.8 --> 5897.84
it was really nice

5907.04 --> 5912.48
right so anything else guys and gals

5910.4 --> 5915.679
want to talk about

5912.48 --> 5915.678999999999
i've got 10 more minutes

5920.48 --> 5929.36
let's mess that sugar chat

5925.04 --> 5932.96
where's tony did tony block me

5929.36 --> 5935.119
still hasn't clicked still hasn't read

5932.96 --> 5935.119
up

5935.44 --> 5939.36
man i may have really pissed him off i

5937.84 --> 5943.360000000001
don't know

5939.36 --> 5943.36
or maybe he's just in a weird mood again

5945.6 --> 5950.08
all right smash that super chat well not

5948.4 --> 5953.839999999999
necessarily even the super chat

5950.08 --> 5953.84
the paypal preferably

5954.639 --> 5961.1990000000005
i had to basically get some emergency

5958.96 --> 5966.32
funds yesterday

5961.199 --> 5969.199
because i ran out unfortunately but

5966.32 --> 5971.5199999999995
yeah i got still got enough food for a

5969.199 --> 5971.5199999999995
while

5992.84 --> 5995.84
this

6006.48 --> 6010.4
the psychopaths are the true enemy

6011.199 --> 6018.7699999999995
maybe it's difficult

6015.52 --> 6018.77
[Music]

6019.52 --> 6026.56
because the psychopaths make

6022.56 --> 6028.719
yourself the true enemy you know

6026.56 --> 6028.719
like

6030.719 --> 6034.56
they're just kind of like it's a matter

6032.639 --> 6036.639
of perspective they always just test you

6034.56 --> 6041.76
because they're only

6036.639 --> 6041.76
interested in power so they test power

6041.84 --> 6049.6
and now if you can't deal with it then

6045.199 --> 6053.678999999999
they make you your own enemy

6049.6 --> 6053.679
and it's yeah it's very systematic

6057.84 --> 6065.84
so are they the true enemy or is the

6059.76 --> 6065.84
true enemy yourself

6071.6 --> 6075.04
not trying to defend psychopaths of

6073.679 --> 6078.32
course and yeah if they

6075.04 --> 6080.8
go overboard and start doing horrific

6078.32 --> 6084.48
things then that's different

6080.8 --> 6088.4800000000005
but yeah a lot of psychopaths

6084.48 --> 6091.44
are very much in control

6088.48 --> 6093.04
they kind of like know how to ride the

6091.44 --> 6096.719
law

6093.04 --> 6098.48
and stay legal and then

6096.719 --> 6100.4
you just start to really hate them

6098.48 --> 6101.759999999999
because yeah they're obviously kind of

6100.4 --> 6104.48
disgusting people not

6101.76 --> 6106.2390000000005
really like lying about a lot of things

6104.48 --> 6108.638999999999
causing nasty things

6106.239 --> 6109.44
whereas the people that are fooled by it

6108.639 --> 6111.52
that just

6109.44 --> 6112.96
do the damage to themselves because of

6111.52 --> 6114.719
it

6112.96 --> 6117.119
you know that that's what we know as the

6114.719 --> 6119.52
grabblers

6117.119 --> 6121.839999999999
they just use our own stupidity against

6119.52 --> 6121.84
us

6127.04 --> 6130.88
support what you like and lock up your

6128.639 --> 6135.84
bike

6130.88 --> 6135.84
yeah i'm dutch i got bike locks

6136.15 --> 6139.62
[Music]

6141.04 --> 6145.44
what are the fireworks a part of there

6143.52 --> 6147.360000000001
it's just the new year celebration like

6145.44 --> 6151.44
everybody can buy fireworks

6147.36 --> 6153.199
for that and it's kind of tradition that

6151.44 --> 6155.919999999999
new year's evening everybody just starts

6153.199 --> 6159.759999999999
lighting it off

6155.92 --> 6161.84
just goes nuts it's not like

6159.76 --> 6163.360000000001
the government does it and then

6161.84 --> 6165.6
everybody can watch you know everybody

6163.36 --> 6168.32
just buys their own stuff

6165.6 --> 6169.119000000001
like specific firework shops open all

6168.32 --> 6170.5599999999995
over the place

6169.119 --> 6172.719
everywhere and everybody can buy

6170.56 --> 6174.4800000000005
fireworks like in the last two or three

6172.719 --> 6177.84
days

6174.48 --> 6177.839999999999
before the new year

6184.4 --> 6190.719
kids just like to blow [ __ ] up they like

6187.76 --> 6194.4800000000005
to but if they get really vandalist

6190.719 --> 6194.4800000000005
then the police will come after them

6197.28 --> 6202.0
it well it depends on the region i

6200.0 --> 6205.84
haven't seen too much

6202.0 --> 6205.84
vandalism over here

6206.4 --> 6211.679
like there was a regular just some

6209.76 --> 6214.56
guys or something we're always smashing

6211.679 --> 6216.159
like bus stop windows very annoying

6214.56 --> 6218.0
but i haven't seen that for a while so i

6216.159 --> 6220.5599999999995
think that was just a couple of kids or

6218.0 --> 6223.92
something and they got really caught

6220.56 --> 6223.92
maybe they were just criminals

6224.56 --> 6227.84
because i haven't seen that in a while

6229.76 --> 6233.52
but yeah there's always a couple of

6231.6 --> 6235.4400000000005
trash cans that just get it

6233.52 --> 6237.679
you know they get completely blown up by

6235.44 --> 6237.678999999999
some

6238.32 --> 6243.44
happens every single time but not

6241.76 --> 6246.4800000000005
every single one of them at least they

6243.44 --> 6248.159
don't blow up everything it's just like

6246.48 --> 6261.839999999999
there's always some trash can that's

6248.159 --> 6261.839999999999
gonna get it

6271.52 --> 6275.52
okay this is just [ __ ] i don't know

6273.6 --> 6277.4400000000005
who the [ __ ] you are but stop

6275.52 --> 6289.84
blabbering your nonsense in my chat

6277.44 --> 6289.839999999999
thank you very much

6300.84 --> 6305.360000000001
ah yes a reminiscent stone

6305.76 --> 6311.04
i know isn't that weird i've been saying

6309.28 --> 6314.84
that for a while the actual

6311.04 --> 6318.159
end of the world might be

6314.84 --> 6320.719
in uh eight days

6318.159 --> 6320.719
that's right

6321.28 --> 6326.48
so what's going to happen what is going

6323.76 --> 6331.84
to happen is it all going to blow up

6326.48 --> 6331.839999999999
or is it just cluck sky clock resets

6332.56 --> 6336.320000000001
and who knows what's gonna happen maybe

6334.48 --> 6338.718999999999
it's like okay

6336.32 --> 6341.44
elites take it as a starting signal like

6338.719 --> 6343.04
okay now everybody's gonna declare war

6341.44 --> 6344.638999999999
like all of a sudden everybody gets

6343.04 --> 6347.36
together okay yeah we're signing this

6344.639 --> 6348.4800000000005
war petition now like congress

6370.8 --> 6375.360000000001
nervous too

6373.04 --> 6377.28

6375.36 --> 6380.239
like the veil opens up and they're just

6377.28 --> 6382.48
gonna like declassify everything

6380.239 --> 6383.36
like everything on an interdimensional

6382.48 --> 6386.0
level like

6383.36 --> 6387.759999999999

witness this through your dream

6398.08 --> 6403.76
that could happen i'm kind of expecting

6401.84 --> 6407.119000000001
that to at least happen to me

6403.76 --> 6407.92
because i seem to be in that sort of

6407.119 --> 6410.4

my entire life having that kind of

6410.4 --> 6412.719

6552.84 --> 6556.96
so

6555.28 --> 6558.32
but it could be guys it could be that

6556.96 --> 6561.76
like in

6558.32 --> 6564.159
in eight days like the peace

6561.76 --> 6565.52
like despite all the media rumbling and

6564.159 --> 6566.159
all that you know because media has gone

6565.52 --> 6568.320000000001
pretty

6566.159 --> 6570.5599999999995
crazy but it could be that just this

6568.32 --> 6572.32
piece we've all

6570.56 --> 6574.0
sort of grew up in despite all the

6572.32 --> 6577.04
ruckus is just suddenly

6574.0 --> 6577.52
like just like that over like really

6577.04 --> 6579.76
over

6577.52 --> 6581.4400000000005
like suddenly it's war everywhere it

6579.76 --> 6583.84
could just happen just like that i don't

6581.44 --> 6583.839999999999
know

6586.88 --> 6590.08
just from one day to the next and

6588.56 --> 6593.1990000000005
suddenly it's like yeah

6590.08 --> 6596.239
everybody's at war and every like

6593.199 --> 6597.119
everything's just being forced and

6596.239 --> 6599.44
suddenly like

6597.119 --> 6601.28
no more tolerance whatsoever for any

6599.44 --> 6603.119
kind of protesting and people are just

6601.28 --> 6605.5199999999995
getting forcefully crafted

6603.119 --> 6607.199
i don't know how crazy it would get if

6605.52 --> 6611.84
something like that would happen i hope

6607.199 --> 6611.839999999999
it doesn't happen i really do

6616.56 --> 6621.1990000000005
i hope it's just another day just

6619.199 --> 6624.08
another day of blabbering and lying

6621.199 --> 6627.678999999999
politicians like always

6624.08 --> 6631.36
and not suddenly like everybody's at war

6627.679 --> 6631.36
with other countries and stuff and

6635.36 --> 6643.36
right so let's just

6638.48 --> 6645.5199999999995
pray everything continues as it does and

6643.36 --> 6647.92
[ __ ] is not massively gonna hit the fan

6645.52 --> 6650.84
all of a sudden

6647.92 --> 6654.56
and things will just gradually progress

6650.84 --> 6658.400000000001
to a conclusion

6654.56 --> 6660.400000000001
