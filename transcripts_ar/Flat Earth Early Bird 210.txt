65.81 --> 71.56
Amsterdam time so today the weather is

70.31 --> 77.3
[Music]

71.56 --> 79.61
excellent it's beautiful I'm just gonna

77.3 --> 82.22
say that I've not really seen any

79.61 --> 84.89
chemtrails I didn't even see planes

82.22 --> 89.69
flying over leaving contrails

84.89 --> 91.399
no chemtrails I think I don't know but

89.69 --> 94.61
yeah a couple of clouds here and there

91.399 --> 100.19
it's really warm it's still windy but

94.61 --> 103.869
not yeah so not so violently like during

100.19 --> 105.979
the storms great weather nice and warm

103.869 --> 110.269
so how are you all doing

105.979 --> 114.44
I got tumeric coffee with me

110.269 --> 119.66000000000001
the old fashioned recipe powder although

114.44 --> 121.929
I put a left over piece of the root in

119.66 --> 121.929
it

123.52 --> 129.26999999999998
because yet it felt like wrong just

126.34 --> 133.06
throwing that away so see what that does

129.27 --> 135.79000000000002
maybe it'd be fun to have like put small

133.06 --> 140.44
slices into it just for that freshy

135.79 --> 144.29999999999998
taste anyway yeah I also got an apple

140.44 --> 148.45
yeah smaller than the previous ones and

144.3 --> 152.59
still got sandwich I completely bypass

148.45 --> 154.209
breakfast so I'm gonna be eating more

152.59 --> 159.70000000000002
and T of course

154.209 --> 162.7
so yeah I'm so stacked up here and yeah

159.7 --> 165.97
to start off with again I do this so

162.7 --> 169.209
often apparently I end up the show and

165.97 --> 170.95
just follow this routine and yesterday I

169.209 --> 174.43
said yeah I'm gonna join the debates

170.95 --> 177.51899999999998
right after this one hour mark perfectly

174.43 --> 182.11
and then of course it's Sunday and I'm

177.519 --> 184.54
like ah it's just weird

182.11 --> 188.29000000000002
because I thought it was Monday for some

184.54 --> 196.739
reason I don't know why but yeah today

188.29 --> 196.739
is Monday Monday the 10th of June 2019

197.04 --> 203.22
yeah getting halfway of the year already

205.56 --> 208.98
time flies

211.04 --> 217.79899999999998
but yeah I have something to look

213.599 --> 222.12
forward to of course the conference in

217.799 --> 225.15
Amsterdam in September yeah I already

222.12 --> 229.59
have two tickets oh yeah I'm curious as

225.15 --> 233.06900000000002
to what it'll be like what real-life

229.59 --> 239.4
responses of people will be versus

233.069 --> 245.73
online interaction because it can be

239.4 --> 249.26
kind of different and yeah just very

245.73 --> 252.69
curious to meet all these people and as

249.26 --> 255.29899999999998
kind of like pretty much sure I'm gonna

252.69 --> 258.03
meet Dan Winfield and I've known him for

255.299 --> 260.88
quite a long time and a lot of private

258.03 --> 261.9
conversations over Skype and such he's a

260.88 --> 266.25
really nice guy

261.9 --> 268.34999999999997
but gets a bit wacky sometimes bit

266.25 --> 272.61
reckless but he doesn't mean any harm

268.35 --> 274.47
it's just he's just Dan Winfield but

272.61 --> 278.49
I'll meet up with him and probably hang

274.47 --> 281.389
out hang with him afterwards so yeah

278.49 --> 281.389
looking forward to that

291.569 --> 299.72900000000004
yeah watched Owen Benjamin again it was

294.09 --> 302.58
really good and it was kind of funny

299.729 --> 304.58
because he basically also when made it

302.58 --> 313.56
more obvious that he indeed was

304.58 --> 321.33
unusually unusually irritable so yeah it

313.56 --> 325.199
was just great and the original shout

321.33 --> 326.75899999999996
out I think it wasn't meant negative but

325.199 --> 328.74
might have slipped through with that

326.759 --> 330.389
because he was just I don't know why

328.74 --> 336.21000000000004
he's there yeah educated it didn't

330.389 --> 339.569
really maybe it's because he misses beer

336.21 --> 341.43
or like alcohol or something or I don't

339.569 --> 346.68
know what it is I don't even want to

341.43 --> 349.169
bring it up to make it tough on him no

346.68 --> 352.28000000000003
but if I would speculate I'd say that

349.169 --> 355.19899999999996
he'd been taking alcohol free beer and

352.28 --> 357.23999999999995
maybe that kind of got him hyped up and

355.199 --> 360.599
then he really wanted the real thing

357.24 --> 365.13
because I don't know he hasn't said just

360.599 --> 369.81
purely speculating here but yeah he was

365.13 --> 372.539
irritable still very funny and serious

369.81 --> 375.87
good stuff it's too much to even yeah

372.539 --> 380.93
and we hang out by itself just going

375.87 --> 380.93
over everything he said he says a lot

386.449 --> 395.18
ah zoom yeah Ralph theta says zoom truth

391.789 --> 397.18899999999996
calm I checked it out yet I've heard of

395.18 --> 398.41
it like one time before I haven't

397.189 --> 401.97
checked it out yet

398.41 --> 401.97
[Music]

410.999 --> 419.149
oh yeah yeah I did click on it I haven't

414.419 --> 419.149
made anything for it yet

423.54 --> 426.41
hmm

426.43 --> 434.889
also I don't know I don't know I'd have

431.68 --> 439.26
to learn a little bit more about it do I

434.889 --> 439.26
really want to be traceable like that I

440.01 --> 450.88
don't know or it's probably just the

446.31 --> 455.26
like a map of addresses right and then

450.88 --> 455.68
with flags over the world map yeah why

455.26 --> 457.81
not

455.68 --> 460.51
my address is pretty much public anyway

457.81 --> 470.38
yeah I think oh I'll check that out

460.51 --> 472.8
after this right so yeah things are

470.38 --> 475.8
growing fast it's not a good reason

472.8 --> 479.38
enough for me to just join something but

475.8 --> 483.3
sure by the way let's go through chat

479.38 --> 486.699
for a moment ATM is in here Daniel

483.3 --> 489.28000000000003
talking earlier righteous force James

486.699 --> 493.45
Mason a McKenzie drunken bullet for one

489.28 --> 497.73999999999995
one earth circus Runa Thorsen pumpkin

493.45 --> 501.28
puffs Johnson Steve DMT matrix long time

497.74 --> 506.82
no see well theta peanuts clerk right

501.28 --> 506.82
yeah Steve good to see you all

511.05 --> 515.409
glass jaw

512.36 --> 515.409
[Music]

521.3 --> 528.68
what did i do yesterday oh god yeah

524.71 --> 531.83
watching more angry video game nerd it's

528.68 --> 535.76
kind of weird though because it has so

531.83 --> 541.22
much like an inhibited dark influences

535.76 --> 543.08
it's kind of childish but you can't look

541.22 --> 545.9300000000001
at that [ __ ] for too long at the same

543.08 --> 551.99
time just figure that out but it's

545.93 --> 554.2099999999999
really funny I really like get the

551.99 --> 557.27
angles to it I used to rage over video

554.21 --> 560.0500000000001
games a lot as well or I would just

557.27 --> 562.73
completely shut it in and just

560.05 --> 564.65
oversimplify myself until I would just

562.73 --> 567.0500000000001
make it no matter what and not have

564.65 --> 569.87
emotions over it just to get it done

567.05 --> 571.3299999999999
I was very fanatical with games when I

569.87 --> 574.36
was much younger

571.33 --> 577.13
so he kind of reminds me about that

574.36 --> 580.69
although I don't do that [ __ ] anymore

577.13 --> 582.41
like that I don't even have the patience

580.69 --> 586.25
but yeah

582.41 --> 588.64
it's funny and it's very retro and yeah

586.25 --> 591.59
that way you also sometimes get to she

588.64 --> 594.35
get to learn about unexpectedly good

591.59 --> 597.14
games do make me kind of curious like

594.35 --> 599.0600000000001
mmm how would that be on emulator or

597.14 --> 600.9499999999999
something because there's a lot of those

599.06 --> 603.41
out there all I'm really missing is a

600.95 --> 605.21
proper controller interface but that

603.41 --> 606.77
those probably exists but will cost

605.21 --> 611.74
money so I'm not going to really get

606.77 --> 611.74
into that but still

613.06 --> 617.8199999999999
I do like old games

625.069 --> 631.7299999999999
right so any flatter stuff could be

629.009 --> 631.73
talking about

642.22 --> 648.6700000000001
I didn't watch josé's or anything

645.66 --> 650.5889999999999
alright yeah back to old Benjamin for a

648.67 --> 653.5889999999999
moment he did actually at some point

650.589 --> 655.2090000000001
just out of nowhere he kind of went

653.589 --> 659.649
beyond the moon landing and just said

655.209 --> 662.1289999999999
that space is fake like I don't think

659.649 --> 665.8
he's ever said it like that before

662.129 --> 668.9490000000001
like he went all in with that out of

665.8 --> 673.5889999999999
nowhere out of the blue so I wonder if

668.949 --> 673.5889999999999
he's how far he's gonna go

678.16 --> 685.75
Flat Earth has gone quiet nothing new

680.77 --> 688.78
really uh let's see I don't think so

685.75 --> 691.36
like right before the show started like

688.78 --> 694.66
all morning there's big videos even it

691.36 --> 700.1800000000001
wasn't interesting do all hang out

694.66 --> 705.87
between Horry and his name again Flat

700.18 --> 705.87
Earth Fokker that was kind of good

709.54 --> 714.81
Hori still going but yeah he's gaming I

716.13 --> 724.9
yeah yeah it it that stuff really

722.08 --> 728.73
doesn't interest me at all like if it

724.9 --> 732.18
were really games that I'd like maybe

728.73 --> 734.6800000000001
but yeah I don't you know almost all

732.18 --> 737.29
first-person related games I don't like

734.68 --> 742.2399999999999
him anymore and they nauseate me as well

737.29 --> 745.78
so not gonna be watching that but yeah

742.24 --> 748.32
he keeps on going hurry also stills flat

745.78 --> 748.3199999999999
smacking

759.92 --> 771.709
I was there anything interesting

762.589 --> 774.7090000000001
noteworthy on ball-busters afford change

771.709 --> 778.31
it did actually get to watch Alex Jones

774.709 --> 782.1099999999999
and Sunday it starts unusually late and

778.31 --> 784.579
I tend to kind of like overlook it this

782.11 --> 786.529
time I didn't watch it like it was kind

784.579 --> 790.55
of interesting again but yet

786.529 --> 794.57
Oh God by the way something that I have

790.55 --> 798.1099999999999
to really talk about in that regard ties

794.57 --> 801.9100000000001
things into it's like oh god some of you

798.11 --> 804.8000000000001
may have actually just checked out like

801.91 --> 807.98
Infowars live stream which is pretty

804.8 --> 810.3199999999999
much their own surfer on their own

807.98 --> 812.38
website because they're completely ban

810.32 --> 818.269
of YouTube and everything you can't even

812.38 --> 820.79
like restream it but god yes like this

818.269 --> 824.029
commercial now for his t-shirt his new

820.79 --> 828.92
t-shirt is NASA t-shirt modified with

824.029 --> 832.55
space force and I guess yeah it is kind

828.92 --> 834.86
of like okay really ultra doubling down

832.55 --> 838.25
on the globe of course Alex Jones would

834.86 --> 843.5600000000001
do that but then he made this

838.25 --> 848.39
advertisement with this sorry but that

843.56 --> 853.2399999999999
is just a such gay little song it's it's

848.39 --> 860.48
cringe-worthy and I don't understand

853.24 --> 863.899
like what is he doing just so like

860.48 --> 867.47
really like are you trying to sell space

863.899 --> 874.329
to gay people are you trying to I don't

867.47 --> 874.3290000000001
know what he's do it was so freaky like

875.15 --> 879.86
yeah then like that the advertisement

877.49 --> 884.42
just it's like oh god what are you doing

879.86 --> 887.33
Alex and that's pretty much it

884.42 --> 890.18
like a lot of his other advertisements

887.33 --> 891.86
are like small pieces that tend to keep

890.18 --> 893.7399999999999
on repeating over and over again every

891.86 --> 896.6
now and then but they are pretty good I

893.74 --> 899.3
really like yet he used to do that

896.6 --> 900.86
earlier and then then just hammer in

899.3 --> 903.26
certain points that was annoying he's

900.86 --> 906.89
making like more Story pieces now like

903.26 --> 909.23
that like using advertisement the

906.89 --> 914.6899999999999
advertisement format as story pieces and

909.23 --> 916.37
he does it kind of eloquently so that is

914.69 --> 919.0100000000001
also one of the thing that I'm

916.37 --> 924.95
interested in because he just really is

919.01 --> 927.71
like ambitious with the media platform

924.95 --> 930.0200000000001
itself an advertisement and he's almost

927.71 --> 931.73
like restless with it and constantly

930.02 --> 933.8299999999999
trying to change things around trying

931.73 --> 937.3100000000001
new things out pushing the boundaries

933.83 --> 940.4000000000001
and it's not something that I would

937.31 --> 945.2299999999999
naturally do like that but it's really

940.4 --> 949.31
interesting for me that aspect about it

945.23 --> 951.35
also and yeah just you know what I've

949.31 --> 953.709
been watching him for 20 years you get

951.35 --> 957.98
some endurance for it all and for the

953.709 --> 959.7199999999999
intensity level and everything and I

957.98 --> 962.1800000000001
don't know that's kind of similar as to

959.72 --> 963.5600000000001
flatter debates like yeah if you want to

962.18 --> 965.3299999999999
watch the Flat Earth debate debate

963.56 --> 968.42
you're gonna have to sell sit through

965.33 --> 973.6700000000001
some serious cursing and yelling at

968.42 --> 976.7299999999999
times when people get really crazy and

973.67 --> 978.29
stupid and if you can't handle that yeah

976.73 --> 980.24
you're just gonna be your friend and oh

978.29 --> 981.4699999999999
this is terrible how can you treat your

980.24 --> 983.779
guests like that and you're gonna go

981.47 --> 985.22
away not like it and try to poop all

983.779 --> 987.709
over it from a distance

985.22 --> 990.47
right or you could just sit through it

987.709 --> 994.0999999999999
and just learn that that's part of it

990.47 --> 997.339
grow some skin and then just see what's

994.1 --> 998.6800000000001
going on in there and why is it actually

997.339 --> 1003.9590000000001
happening like that

998.68 --> 1003.959
and it yeah it's kind of the same

1004.47 --> 1013.4490000000001
and in a way it's kind of with me as

1006.999 --> 1018.519
well like yeah people I'd have just me

1013.449 --> 1021.04
talking a lot and being kind of yeah

1018.519 --> 1023.919
sometimes very hyper and interruptive

1021.04 --> 1027.779
with other people that's annoying but

1023.919 --> 1029.949
yeah if you're just too annoyed by that

1027.779 --> 1031.779
then you're just gonna be bumping into

1029.949 --> 1033.72
that and not looking beyond what I'm

1031.779 --> 1038.549
actually trying to accomplish and

1033.72 --> 1042.039
certain level of energy concentration

1038.549 --> 1045.37
certain frequency I'm trying to hit keep

1042.039 --> 1048.76
up there basically literally trying to

1045.37 --> 1050.9189999999999
hold the bar up over my head for

1048.76 --> 1052.87
everyone in a way it's it's hard to

1050.919 --> 1055.3600000000001
describe but I try to do that and yeah

1052.87 --> 1057.899
the people that do bypass like oh god

1055.36 --> 1060.07
yeah the guy is kind of hyperactive I'm

1057.899 --> 1065.83
really great that some people can do

1060.07 --> 1069.639
that they will see that so yeah and at

1065.83 --> 1073.72
the same time look people that are like

1069.639 --> 1076.57
the way I am when I meet them other

1073.72 --> 1079.779
people that are kind of similar it's

1076.57 --> 1082.24
really tough for me to basically not get

1079.779 --> 1088.48
agitated over them so I totally get it

1082.24 --> 1091.659
it's the problem is the same source of

1088.48 --> 1095.98
energy that kind of like drives the more

1091.659 --> 1098.7990000000002
annoying parts also drives like the big

1095.98 --> 1100.929
focus the big look so it's really just

1098.799 --> 1103.21
wielding with it and just timing it all

1100.929 --> 1106.029
right and that's just it's a learning

1103.21 --> 1108.97
process all of the time and I hope now

1106.029 --> 1112.57
that after I've been active on YouTube

1108.97 --> 1115.529
for what is it three four years that if

1112.57 --> 1120.36
you compare the earlier things with now

1115.529 --> 1120.36
I'm much more fluid now hopefully

1122.48 --> 1128.48
yeah I don't lash out in bad dissonant

1127.37 --> 1137.81
ways anymore

1128.48 --> 1139.6100000000001
hopefully at least not on camera I I try

1137.81 --> 1142.46
not to ramble on for too long

1139.61 --> 1145.8799999999999
well while at first I would take any

1142.46 --> 1147.92
opportunity to do that but then suddenly

1145.88 --> 1150.2
after a while I would know just like oh

1147.92 --> 1151.91
I'm rambling and then get really shocked

1150.2 --> 1156.56
by it and then just shut her off it's

1151.91 --> 1160.43
like the natural responses to the social

1156.56 --> 1162.6799999999998
interaction were like too much the

1160.43 --> 1165.95
impulses that normally make you switch

1162.68 --> 1169.13
like midway in your energy output or

1165.95 --> 1172.04
intake it was too heavy and it shocked

1169.13 --> 1173.96
me that because it's yeah because of the

1172.04 --> 1175.82
sensitivity I think and I learned to

1173.96 --> 1180.23
deal with that all over my life

1175.82 --> 1182.27
and especially now it's like I already

1180.23 --> 1184.1
learned to deal with it to some level

1182.27 --> 1187.55
and I'm like trying to push that

1184.1 --> 1189.9499999999998
boundary to get it even better basically

1187.55 --> 1192.8
not be shocked by anything from myself

1189.95 --> 1196.31
at least and eventually hopefully not by

1192.8 --> 1199.04
anyone else out there just so that I

1196.31 --> 1203.2
really energetically know how to deal

1199.04 --> 1207.29
with everything just in this on the spot

1203.2 --> 1209.57
to perfect the improvisation element of

1207.29 --> 1214.82
it yeah

1209.57 --> 1218.74
and in that way I can overall yeah be

1214.82 --> 1224.51
more secured by my ability to interact

1218.74 --> 1226.55
not get stuck not get frozen and you

1224.51 --> 1231.02
sorry maybe this is getting a little bit

1226.55 --> 1235.3
vague for you guys yeah right yeah I'm

1231.02 --> 1238.49
I'm talking about just

1235.3 --> 1239.51
to oversimplify it is kind of similar to

1238.49 --> 1241.46
stage fright

1239.51 --> 1244.31
some people have it a lot and some

1241.46 --> 1247.43
people are naturals they don't have they

1244.31 --> 1252.32
barely have it at all or they kind of

1247.43 --> 1256.3700000000001
learn to deal with it really young it it

1252.32 --> 1258.77
yeah just came in early on and they've

1256.37 --> 1260.7199999999998
fulfilled a role very easily with that

1258.77 --> 1264.77
happens with some people with others it

1260.72 --> 1267.77
doesn't all depends on yeah how you are

1264.77 --> 1271.0
the combined elements of your character

1267.77 --> 1271.0
and talents

1282.809 --> 1287.73
vagueness builds character

1286.31 --> 1290.73
[Music]

1287.73 --> 1290.73
breezy

1295.16 --> 1298.42
I don't think so

1302.93 --> 1308.5700000000002
I think vagueness is mostly a defense

1305.57 --> 1313.12
mechanism right okay yeah I didn't get

1308.57 --> 1313.12
the joke difficult

1320.33 --> 1332.6699999999998
right so let's get back to some kind of

1323.43 --> 1339.059
subject what's going on is there some

1332.67 --> 1343.8600000000001
news stuff right yeah market rate war

1339.059 --> 1347.78
stuff seems to be heating up slightly or

1343.86 --> 1347.78
it's just like migrating its focus

1353.93 --> 1361.04
I think I am getting this feeling that

1356.72 --> 1363.64
this entire summer is gonna be pretty

1361.04 --> 1367.55
broody in a way like there's gonna be

1363.64 --> 1374.5
uncertainties from a lot of angles like

1367.55 --> 1374.5
a lot of friction but no clear direction

1375.61 --> 1381.9199999999998
like everybody is basically beefing up

1378.56 --> 1384.4099999999999
and then starting to brag against one

1381.92 --> 1387.26
another and starting to like trying to

1384.41 --> 1389.3000000000002
claim alpha state or some myths I think

1387.26 --> 1396.98
it's gonna be a lot like that and during

1389.3 --> 1399.8899999999999
this summer I don't think there's gonna

1396.98 --> 1404.48
be like any type a new war thing going

1399.89 --> 1409.88
on though if that's gonna happen it's

1404.48 --> 1411.92
going to be probably yeah closer to two

1409.88 --> 1418.16
October or something or September maybe

1411.92 --> 1423.1100000000001
again I hope not but certainly something

1418.16 --> 1426.92
seems to be a lot of yeah chest bumping

1423.11 --> 1429.28
and [ __ ] going on geopolitically let's

1426.92 --> 1429.28
see

1440.67 --> 1446.3700000000001
it is kind of interesting though even

1443.34 --> 1449.6699999999998
through I guess a third party through in

1446.37 --> 1453.6
force trying to look at what's going on

1449.67 --> 1455.3400000000001
in Europe and it it's kind of

1453.6 --> 1462.3899999999999
embarrassing like I should have my own

1455.34 --> 1465.75
Dutch sources but I don't know I'm just

1462.39 --> 1467.91
not used to doing getting my information

1465.75 --> 1469.89
in Dutch I don't know what this is in in

1467.91 --> 1474.8400000000001
the whole way Dutch people tend to talk

1469.89 --> 1475.41
is such a different wavelength I don't

1474.84 --> 1479.82
know what it is

1475.41 --> 1481.5600000000002
but I feel that yeah that like Jenna

1479.82 --> 1484.6699999999998
says it like Europe is almost like

1481.56 --> 1488.87
revolting against the elites against the

1484.67 --> 1494.19
this self-proclaimed European Union

1488.87 --> 1498.51
bureaucrats an elected government that

1494.19 --> 1500.3400000000001
seems to be kind of happening and that

1498.51 --> 1502.8
really seems to be movement in this

1500.34 --> 1504.6299999999999
whatever it's gonna turn out to become

1502.8 --> 1507.54
eventually it is another matter

1504.63 --> 1509.8500000000001
because it could still become like a

1507.54 --> 1512.22
Europe but with a different type yeah

1509.85 --> 1514.62
with a different set up all kinds of

1512.22 --> 1518.6100000000001
things that could happen I've seen a lot

1514.62 --> 1522.75
of this stuff even in the dark world but

1518.61 --> 1526.9799999999998
it was very confusing because everything

1522.75 --> 1530.51
I saw was pretty much like much later

1526.98 --> 1530.51
after the result I don't know

1533.419 --> 1540.1090000000002
but from what I felt at least and from

1536.869 --> 1544.6999999999998
what I caught myself talking about it

1540.109 --> 1549.7089999999998
seemed like yeah this this kind of like

1544.7 --> 1552.799
weird plutocracy Europe model that's now

1549.709 --> 1555.2
been built upon the original just trade

1552.799 --> 1558.889
agreements which Europe originally was

1555.2 --> 1562.719
with the euro and all that that thing is

1558.889 --> 1567.7389999999998
just not gonna last and it's gonna be

1562.719 --> 1571.539
messy but not too messy and yeah it's

1567.739 --> 1571.539
just gonna be a new kind of setup

1575.29 --> 1579.79
and I think that eventually Europe would

1577.48 --> 1583.09
come back together again but in a more

1579.79 --> 1585.85
sensible format I think I'm not sure yet

1583.09 --> 1589.24
we'll get back to that probably got

1585.85 --> 1591.34
plenty years to get over that get to a

1589.24 --> 1593.82
point where yeah I can be more clear

1591.34 --> 1593.82
about this

1619.21 --> 1632.39
okay hello leb alright so I a big

1629.27 --> 1638.27
deficit of ultraviolet light coming off

1632.39 --> 1646.1200000000001
the Sun you say it's a hole okay

1638.27 --> 1648.71
I haven't don't don't be a drama queen

1646.12 --> 1655.1299999999999
you're not all gonna die before any

1648.71 --> 1659.38
freaking wake up and if we would it's

1655.13 --> 1659.38
completely useless to ponder upon that

1661.57 --> 1670.1899999999998
all right well yeah the Sun is a very

1664.61 --> 1673.85
interesting light phenomena so it's

1670.19 --> 1676.52
doing its doing you know as far as I'm

1673.85 --> 1687.35
concerned the Sun could literally do

1676.52 --> 1688.8799999999999
anything I've seen videos where the Sun

1687.35 --> 1693.08
was literally blinking like a

1688.88 --> 1700.69
stroboscope insane but look pretty damn

1693.08 --> 1704.6899999999998
real and I've seen this sudden like I

1700.69 --> 1708.3200000000002
don't know just radiating in a very

1704.69 --> 1713.8400000000001
weird way making shapes and [ __ ]

1708.32 --> 1717.049
so whatever the Sun is doing whatever

1713.84 --> 1720.53
type of light is coming from that

1717.049 --> 1723.08
direction I don't know what is causing

1720.53 --> 1726.3799999999999
the deviations in the light types only

1723.08 --> 1729.8899999999999
thing I know is that there is a cyclical

1726.38 --> 1733.7
thing going on with the with the Sun the

1729.89 --> 1735.47
Sun type of light with the seasons that

1733.7 --> 1737.21
is all I'm pretty sure about whatever

1735.47 --> 1739.28
other influences like there may be

1737.21 --> 1745.3
another extra influence or other

1739.28 --> 1748.1499999999999
cyclical effects on top of that but

1745.3 --> 1750.6699999999998
and yeah astrologers will probably then

1748.15 --> 1753.73
start to point me at those connections

1750.67 --> 1756.69
and how that's supposed to work I am NOT

1753.73 --> 1756.69
a expert at that

1770.51 --> 1776.44
how it

1772.75 --> 1778.54
why do you think our Anaka bumble why do

1776.44 --> 1780.78
you think I can say this stuff with a

1778.54 --> 1785.25
straight face

1780.78 --> 1790.45
could it be because I'm being serious

1785.25 --> 1794.05
maybe because I don't have any more

1790.45 --> 1797.26
stupid neurotic responses that tell me

1794.05 --> 1799.48
like oh my god that is so far away from

1797.26 --> 1807.43
the standard you couldn't possibly say

1799.48 --> 1811.29
something like that no that's gone got

1807.43 --> 1811.29
rid of that a long time ago

1833.31 --> 1841.1699999999998
or annual potential okay so annual

1838.17 --> 1847.71
potential in other words means the total

1841.17 --> 1853.26
amount of energy absorbed apparently per

1847.71 --> 1855.57
year well I don't know the oddity is

1853.26 --> 1858.84
this presupposition of how much energy

1855.57 --> 1860.8999999999999
the super fireball son is supposed to be

1858.84 --> 1864.1799999999998
having or is this based on an actual

1860.9 --> 1866.0700000000002
measurement Daniel actual measurement on

1864.18 --> 1870.89
the earth so which one is it

1866.07 --> 1870.8899999999999
I can be

1882.22 --> 1890.98
now that daniel saying we can measure it

1886.72 --> 1894.1290000000001
is not it's not like a response to the

1890.98 --> 1897.039
question I was asking saying that thing

1894.129 --> 1901.899
that you're quoting there right is that

1897.039 --> 1903.9089999999999
based on what light has been absorbed on

1901.899 --> 1906.07
the earth or is it based on a

1903.909 --> 1909.99
presupposition of what the Sun is

1906.07 --> 1909.99
supposedly going to be outputting

1936.06 --> 1938.12
you

1948.4 --> 1954.98
right exactly what I said through a

1951.29 --> 1959.21
solar panel so you absorb an amount of

1954.98 --> 1961.13
light and yeah that's amount the amount

1959.21 --> 1963.14
of light that's coming from the other

1961.13 --> 1964.7600000000002
parent Sun disc direction so that's the

1963.14 --> 1967.46
amount of energy that is being absorbed

1964.76 --> 1970.1
because of the phenomena it causes all

1967.46 --> 1974.33
this light sure well that's actually a

1970.1 --> 1976.58
measurement so yeah one can stay

1974.33 --> 1980.81
definitely there is a lot of any light

1976.58 --> 1985.01
energy coming from the from the light

1980.81 --> 1988.8799999999999
from the Sun from the daylight direction

1985.01 --> 1992.26
of which the Sun is the epicenter light

1988.88 --> 1992.2600000000002
phenomena that you get to see

2007.27 --> 2015.59
catalyst interesting way to put it

2012.82 --> 2018.32
technically yeah light is like an

2015.59 --> 2020.8999999999999
instantaneous connection so wherever

2018.32 --> 2023.48
that light is coming from whether it be

2020.9 --> 2026.51
the physical realm or just electrically

2023.48 --> 2032.29
manifest in some way where the light

2026.51 --> 2037.76
hits yeah it is basically a connection

2032.29 --> 2043.09
so whatever is causing it is causing

2037.76 --> 2043.09
heat and other interactions on the earth

2050.73 --> 2055.97
right

2053.06 --> 2060.89
well the yeah that kind of same what I

2055.97 --> 2063.08
said the actual heat only arrives where

2060.89 --> 2065.15
the light is being interacting is

2063.08 --> 2070.73
interacting and being absorbed by the

2065.15 --> 2073.25
matter so where the beam happens and in

2070.73 --> 2076.36
that sense if yeah you'd literally see

2073.25 --> 2080.179
it as an instantaneous potentially

2076.36 --> 2087.07
infinitely divisible instantly a beam

2080.179 --> 2090.4700000000003
connection then it's literally not

2087.07 --> 2094.159
physical like a connection and it's just

2090.47 --> 2096.49
where the start the spawn point and the

2094.159 --> 2103.6400000000003
absorption points are just connected

2096.49 --> 2106.93
instantly with energy transfer it's

2103.64 --> 2113.42
interesting to think about that now that

2106.93 --> 2116.1499999999996
what's going on basically it's funny how

2113.42 --> 2121.16
energy can literally transform to light

2116.15 --> 2126.98
and no longer be matter I can switch

2121.16 --> 2128.6499999999996
from matter to light or is that what it

2126.98 --> 2132.29
is is they're basically matter

2128.65 --> 2137.02
transforming causing this light or is it

2132.29 --> 2137.02
is light really a byproduct I don't know

2137.68 --> 2144.77
you could problem it's like probably

2140.56 --> 2147.56
physics calculation like electrics put

2144.77 --> 2150.34
in electricity in a lamp you then

2147.56 --> 2153.38
measure the heat the lamp gives off and

2150.34 --> 2158.86
how much light energy is absorbed and

2153.38 --> 2162.1600000000003
then you see it should both be beneath

2158.86 --> 2164.78
details amount of energy that was put in

2162.16 --> 2166.49
that would make sense if it would be

2164.78 --> 2167.9900000000002
more than there's something else

2166.49 --> 2170.77
happening I'd like it then the light

2167.99 --> 2175.2799999999997
becomes kind of a like a byproduct I

2170.77 --> 2181.84
don't know but that's probably not the

2175.28 --> 2181.84
case so in that sense matter is

2182.26 --> 2191.119
transformed broken up in energy could be

2188.359 --> 2195.97
electricity and then transformed into

2191.119 --> 2195.9700000000003
light and then from light back into heat

2201.69 --> 2207.96
it's not photon emission it's light

2205.289 --> 2213.4500000000003
emission super car photons don't exist

2207.96 --> 2217.14
life is not a particle the suggestion of

2213.45 --> 2220.6189999999997
the photon suggests a indivisible

2217.14 --> 2223.1299999999997
minimum unit of energy that is a

2220.619 --> 2227.2400000000002
separate particle and the travels speeds

2223.13 --> 2227.2400000000002
there's no proof of any of that

2231.31 --> 2237.49
I've already shared many times that what

2233.95 --> 2241.6899999999996
I think about photons how they came into

2237.49 --> 2246.81
being conceptually is by yeah the

2241.69 --> 2250.42
minimum registerable photonic energy

2246.81 --> 2252.85
quanta like how what's the minimum

2250.42 --> 2256.69
energy quanta that can be registerable

2252.85 --> 2259.3199999999997
in a reliable way and that was then set

2256.69 --> 2264.52
as the unit but that doesn't mean that

2259.32 --> 2268.51
light could couldn't be less strong that

2264.52 --> 2270.97
it cannot be that becomes invisible it's

2268.51 --> 2275.8
just a matter of what is the minimum

2270.97 --> 2278.95
registry boundary so I don't think there

2275.8 --> 2281.59
is photon particles there there's no

2278.95 --> 2283.6
proof of the speed and there's no real

2281.59 --> 2286.96
sensible proof that they are you

2283.6 --> 2291.2799999999997
indivisible units so the particle

2286.96 --> 2294.43
concept is just its global fication the

2291.28 --> 2297.9700000000003
microcosm I'm pretty sure that just

2294.43 --> 2302.31
instantaneously connecting beams that

2297.97 --> 2302.31
are potentially infinitely divisible

2309.95 --> 2319.8799999999997
well alibied yeah you're taking it

2317.42 --> 2321.9500000000003
another step further look electrons is

2319.88 --> 2324.4100000000003
one thing I don't think that electrons

2321.95 --> 2327.22
are literally particles of well as well

2324.41 --> 2331.3289999999997
I think like light is instantaneous

2327.22 --> 2337.339
infinitely divisible beams I think that

2331.329 --> 2339.73
electricity is an arc and as soon as the

2337.339 --> 2345.8289999999997
arc can manifest it will and the energy

2339.73 --> 2350.2400000000002
arc will manifest and there may be kind

2345.829 --> 2352.4300000000003
of like a sort of like a speed thing but

2350.24 --> 2355.49
that could also be just a reaction of

2352.43 --> 2357.9199999999996
the material I don't know but I think

2355.49 --> 2359.8689999999997
it's I don't think it's literally like

2357.92 --> 2363.109
separate particles either electricity

2359.869 --> 2365.299
like how do you even yeah there's

2363.109 --> 2367.2799999999997
probably a loose theoretics that are

2365.299 --> 2370.25
gonna suggest that it is possible I

2367.28 --> 2372.559
don't really see it but as far as matter

2370.25 --> 2375.2
goes I don't think that's the same I'm

2372.559 --> 2378.3190000000004
pretty sure that matter does eventually

2375.2 --> 2383.48
end up in atoms and that they do become

2378.319 --> 2385.0099999999998
invisible units that you get if you're

2383.48 --> 2389.98
going to divide them further they will

2385.01 --> 2392.1090000000004
completely like one-way direction

2389.98 --> 2397.45
becomes something else

2392.109 --> 2401.42
so with matter with actual material

2397.45 --> 2404.0589999999997
physical material I think it's different

2401.42 --> 2407.63
because I think there are indivisible

2404.059 --> 2411.369
units of material that when you divide

2407.63 --> 2411.369
them further they become something else

2412.45 --> 2418.089
but that's not the same for light and

2415.04 --> 2418.089
electricity I think

2421.95 --> 2425.25
what does that

2427.09 --> 2433.7200000000003
I don't remember

2431.74 --> 2435.37
uh yeah I don't remember super Cerf I

2433.72 --> 2437.8199999999997
just remembered that the L stands for

2435.37 --> 2437.8199999999997
light

2461.59 --> 2467.71
that's funny I don't see the like it

2464.29 --> 2470.7
used to be a short for something right I

2467.71 --> 2470.7
can't find it

2477.69 --> 2483.11
that's weird

2479.24 --> 2483.1099999999997
[Music]

2506.88 --> 2515.1800000000003
does anybody remember that I thought I

2510.99 --> 2517.62
remembered that the word laser was yes

2515.18 --> 2521.81
wasn't that light amplification by

2517.62 --> 2525.45
stimulated emission of radiation huh

2521.81 --> 2529.11
right that's I I can't find that when I

2525.45 --> 2533.31
look for a laser even when and I put

2529.11 --> 2535.11
dots in between every letter doesn't say

2533.31 --> 2537.89
it's just referring to the laser

2535.11 --> 2537.8900000000003
technology

2538.67 --> 2545.36
so yeah Google's not exactly helping out

2543.05 --> 2547.9500000000003
but yeah thanks for that

2545.36 --> 2551.31
mite amplification by stimulated

2547.95 --> 2553.91
emission of radiation it's fascinating

2551.31 --> 2553.91
how that works

2587.73 --> 2594.599
no super curve stop don't

2600.18 --> 2608.14
exciting atoms producing photons it's

2604.33 --> 2612.67
like know what it does it it excites

2608.14 --> 2617.1099999999997
atoms yeah and then those atoms unleash

2612.67 --> 2619.9900000000002
the beam beam a light manifests light

2617.11 --> 2628.7400000000002
and that light will spread as as it as

2619.99 --> 2628.74
far as it can until it's fully absorbed

2631.07 --> 2634.51
there's no photons

2669.28 --> 2678.3100000000004
hmm really a levy does that happen

2674.83 --> 2688.5
that's a candle emit an electromagnetic

2678.31 --> 2688.5
wave is that measurable

2724.41 --> 2731.49
right hmm yeah by the way I almost

2728.4 --> 2733.799
forgot I should have made a note when I

2731.49 --> 2737.4599999999996
just remembered it I've been thinking

2733.799 --> 2741.589
again about the holographic holographic

2737.46 --> 2743.4900000000002
globe of the heavens the Sun mainly and

2741.589 --> 2745.799
I just figured out

2743.49 --> 2747.8999999999996
I just realized another thing basically

2745.799 --> 2752.549
hidden in plain sight among all the

2747.9 --> 2755.19
complexities remember that video that

2752.549 --> 2758.099
one video that pretty much came at the

2755.19 --> 2762.859
beginning of the super high altitude

2758.099 --> 2762.8590000000004
bleep balloon wasn't it the dog video

2763.789 --> 2773.6090000000004
nothing and there was an image off like

2769.74 --> 2777.089
the Sun in the black and it seems like

2773.609 --> 2781.74
it had a spotlight on the fluffy clouds

2777.089 --> 2785.25
below very fascinating to behold like it

2781.74 --> 2788.519
shocked me when I saw that in 2015 that

2785.25 --> 2794.69
image especially shocked me but then I

2788.519 --> 2797.91
realized hold on normally on the earth

2794.69 --> 2804.779
when you point your camera your regular

2797.91 --> 2807.8289999999997
camera to the Sun it's you yeah it

2804.779 --> 2812.88
totally distorts [ __ ]

2807.829 --> 2816.5
you get flares and everything right so

2812.88 --> 2819.4500000000003
in that high altitude how could it be

2816.5 --> 2824.849
literally looking straight into the Sun

2819.45 --> 2828.75
in the middle of the screen and not and

2824.849 --> 2831.2690000000002
just see it see being a parent phenomena

2828.75 --> 2835.289
just hang there it was actually totally

2831.269 --> 2838.8799999999997
different from how we see the Sun from

2835.289 --> 2838.88
the earth it was totally different

2840.98 --> 2848.63
and that just realized that that's not

2845.57 --> 2850.099
how the Sun looks when you face a camera

2848.63 --> 2858.25
to it on the earth

2850.099 --> 2862.4900000000002
I should kind of like find that video

2858.25 --> 2864.92
let's see if I can I'll just show it you

2862.49 --> 2869.2
know I should really present more stuff

2864.92 --> 2869.2000000000003
instead of just talking about them

2885.34 --> 2896.94
mmm the short clothes version

2889.72 --> 2896.9399999999996
let me see so weird

2901.62 --> 2915.85
right and now I'm gonna try to find a

2905.98 --> 2917.65
video from the earth Oh God

2915.85 --> 2921.61
I typed in the Sun and I'm getting all

2917.65 --> 2924.63
these CGI fiery ball [ __ ] that's not

2921.61 --> 2929.1400000000003
what I wanted

2924.63 --> 2939.09
okay filming this one can't show a CGI

2929.14 --> 2939.0899999999997
then okay

2947.9 --> 2952.1600000000003
[Music]

2949.82 --> 2954.8500000000004
all right this seems like something that

2952.16 --> 2954.85
couldn't work

2963.89 --> 2966.89
huh

2971.039 --> 2977.349
okay I'm gonna show you the images and

2973.779 --> 2979.799
just compare them for let's hold bear

2977.349 --> 2979.799
with me

2984.14 --> 2990.44
right so this is the Sun from the earth

2991.16 --> 2998.06
although it's kind of the horizon in

2993.48 --> 2998.06
this one and this is from the dark ham

2999.83 --> 3004.81
right with the light below that

3016.39 --> 3029.4
see all the yellow so much yellow and

3019.48 --> 3029.4
here it just seems to be white so weird

3033.069 --> 3036.069
anyway

3047.53 --> 3052.65
yeah the color could be due to the

3049.33 --> 3052.65
atmosphere definitely

3062.91 --> 3066.71
still pretty flat though

3067.6 --> 3071.8199999999997
[Music]

3077.24 --> 3080.31
[Music]

3082.13 --> 3089.029
and this thing is up so I look look just

3086.93 --> 3094.839
how that freaking Sun is presenting

3089.029 --> 3094.839
itself it's just it makes no sense

3099.119 --> 3103.53
like

3100.72 --> 3107.7099999999996
it's almost like it's just a flashlight

3103.53 --> 3110.1090000000004
not even a few feet away shining in the

3107.71 --> 3117.9
camera wow that sunspot is obviously

3110.109 --> 3117.9
much further away it's so weird

3132.91 --> 3138.3999999999996
yeah definitely not 93 million miles

3136.029 --> 3141.39
away that's correct

3138.4 --> 3141.39
Jessica

3147.23 --> 3154.46
and yeah it just typically looks like it

3150.89 --> 3155.089
is a holographic side effect the Sun

3154.46 --> 3158.66
itself

3155.089 --> 3161.2999999999997
it's just yeah the daylight comes from

3158.66 --> 3165.23
that direction the shadows being cast

3161.3 --> 3168.619
proves it but that thing you see to be

3165.23 --> 3169.97
an actual thing like a physical lamp any

3168.619 --> 3172.369
specific location

3169.97 --> 3181.339
there's just no indication that's the

3172.369 --> 3184.07
case you just get the seedy apparent Sun

3181.339 --> 3187.2799999999997
disc phenomena at the epicenter of the

3184.07 --> 3191.619
daylight direction in relation to your

3187.28 --> 3191.619
position that's it

3200.02 --> 3203.139
[Music]

3225.9 --> 3231.59
well

3228.07 --> 3235.82
Daniel I showed you two types of footage

3231.59 --> 3237.04
one was where the Sun is visible at the

3235.82 --> 3240.77
horizon

3237.04 --> 3245.87
filmed on the earth the other one was

3240.77 --> 3252.2
high up and yeah the apparent Sun disc

3245.87 --> 3253.94
phenomena looked exactly the same and if

3252.2 --> 3257.18
you'd have to use your intuition to

3253.94 --> 3259.76
basically try to assume a distance based

3257.18 --> 3261.71
purely on the visual identification the

3259.76 --> 3266.0
visual sizing up there that's the same

3261.71 --> 3270.68
distance it's just that

3266.0 --> 3276.86
down on earth the earth itself gets in

3270.68 --> 3279.62
the way of the apparent phenomena so it

3276.86 --> 3281.84
just the phenomena just starts to dive

3279.62 --> 3285.2599999999998
into the earth and then the daylight's

3281.84 --> 3291.11
gone but only in relation to your

3285.26 --> 3292.94
position because if you go where that

3291.11 --> 3296.33
appearance on disc would be roughly

3292.94 --> 3297.98
visible and you'd stand there even

3296.33 --> 3299.99
though you'd literally be able to see

3297.98 --> 3302.48
yourself standing in front of that Sun I

3299.99 --> 3304.52
could somehow be possible with a really

3302.48 --> 3309.05
really really good zoom high enough

3304.52 --> 3310.79
altitude camera looking at it I'll bet

3309.05 --> 3314.15
you that person that would be visible

3310.79 --> 3317.18
before the apparent Sun disc as they

3314.15 --> 3324.4100000000003
would seek out the Sun look at it it

3317.18 --> 3326.74
would be a totally different place it

3324.41 --> 3330.2799999999997
would be much higher higher up probably

3326.74 --> 3330.2799999999997
so yeah

3339.9 --> 3341.9300000000003
Oh

3360.539 --> 3362.599
you

3393.93 --> 3395.99
you

3513.97 --> 3526.089
yeah muted though I was talking about

3521.839 --> 3529.73
velocity racer EFI made a good statement

3526.089 --> 3531.02
from Tesla we made sure by experiment

3529.73 --> 3531.589
that light propagates with the same

3531.02 --> 3533.96
velocity

3531.589 --> 3537.14
irrespective irrespective of the

3533.96 --> 3539.42
character source but then I explained

3537.14 --> 3544.25
that yeah that basically says okay light

3539.42 --> 3548.44
is going the same speed but I think that

3544.25 --> 3552.5
that even assumes that it has a speed

3548.44 --> 3555.29
because yeah if you just say okay it's

3552.5 --> 3557.63
all instantaneously connected then it

3555.29 --> 3567.589
would also be the same it just wouldn't

3557.63 --> 3569.7200000000003
be assuming a velocity I just don't know

3567.589 --> 3571.339
where where anyone would come to the

3569.72 --> 3574.06
conclusion that it literally has a

3571.339 --> 3574.06
velocity

3589.96 --> 3595.569
that but look eraser Fei just that

3594.01 --> 3598.3900000000003
doesn't make any sense to me

3595.569 --> 3600.24
look if light had a speed and you could

3598.39 --> 3604.5989999999997
slow it down

3600.24 --> 3608.95
bad enough like really really slow it

3604.599 --> 3611.2000000000003
down then technically you would be able

3608.95 --> 3613.5989999999997
to create a situation where light the

3611.2 --> 3617.7
light would be observed even if the

3613.599 --> 3621.01
source of that light would be turned off

3617.7 --> 3631.99
and then then you could start to suggest

3621.01 --> 3632.92
that there is a velocity but I I don't

3631.99 --> 3638.0099999999998
think so

3632.92 --> 3643.21
but hey maybe somebody could show me

3638.01 --> 3646.0890000000004
this this experiment set up that would

3643.21 --> 3649.059
show that lie definitely can be observed

3646.089 --> 3652.72
even when the source has already been

3649.059 --> 3655.3900000000003
turned off then I may start to have to

3652.72 --> 3660.1299999999997
revisit my concept of light being

3655.39 --> 3662.92
instantaneous connection there could be

other factors at work as well I'm not

3662.92 --> 3665.19
sure

3679.65 --> 3687.869
light travelling has been filmed

3682.9 --> 3687.869
