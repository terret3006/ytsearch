4.52 --> 9.96
with my great brother PT how are you I'm

7.98 --> 13.259
fine I'm fine everything's good like

9.96 --> 15.360000000000001
everything right perfect so but today

13.259 --> 19.92
we're gonna keep going of course with

15.36 --> 22.14
the the book again the PT's book uh

19.92 --> 24.539
uh scriptures for the now and we're

22.14 --> 26.039
gonna I think we were at mute Idols

24.539 --> 28.439
that's what I told you I wasn't sure

26.039 --> 30.42
exactly where we were in the in our

28.439 --> 32.22
thing but we're gonna go with the new

30.42 --> 34.68
titles that I think that's what we were

32.22 --> 40.379
and that's the thing today yeah that's

34.68 --> 43.32
what I think that's part of the the big

40.379 --> 46.26
mess that's going on here is that we

43.32 --> 48.18
praise people I don't think sometimes we

46.26 --> 51.36
praise people that are lower in

48.18 --> 53.46
Consciousness than than us even I

51.36 --> 56.1
realize that people that are more

53.46 --> 57.899
up than us if I can yeah because they're

56.1 --> 60.18
pushed by the system whatever is pushed

57.899 --> 61.68
by the system yeah people respond to

60.18 --> 63.6
whatever is pushed by the system so

61.68 --> 65.46
something someone else chooses those

63.6 --> 69.06
people and

65.46 --> 72.83999999999999
um people have to yeah yeah and so it's

69.06 --> 75.9
not only musicians we can involve also

72.84 --> 78.42
speakers and fake gurus and yeah yeah

75.9 --> 80.46000000000001
everything in the in new titles are

78.42 --> 84.2
meant like even stones

80.46 --> 86.63999999999999
like people watch me yeah yeah

84.2 --> 89.759
like you know like people go to Temples

86.64 --> 92.96000000000001
or like churches or idols and you know

89.759 --> 95.64
which is inanimate objects

92.96 --> 97.19999999999999
inanimate objects yeah like which

95.64 --> 99.479
obviously will not say anything back to

97.2 --> 100.74000000000001
you so you can say anything there'll be

99.479 --> 104.88
no

100.74 --> 106.91999999999999
okay that's what you mean like Jesus on

104.88 --> 108.65899999999999
the cross yeah yeah whatever like

106.92 --> 110.93900000000001
different Idols which I use all around

108.659 --> 113.06
the world like not one specific

110.939 --> 115.13999999999999
everywhere in the world everywhere

113.06 --> 117.96000000000001
everywhere and then they are used and

115.14 --> 121.68
then people uh because it doesn't talk

117.96 --> 124.91999999999999
back to you so like it's easy

121.68 --> 127.32000000000001
that's the thing yeah I always found

124.92 --> 129.66
that weird that we were going in front

127.32 --> 132.72
of statue and stuff like that and

129.66 --> 134.57999999999998
praising them and like what do you want

132.72 --> 137.28
them to enter you know

134.58 --> 138.48000000000002
yeah but they don't answer so it's a

137.28 --> 140.34
one-way traffic it's a one-way

138.48 --> 143.06
conversation so people it suits people

140.34 --> 146.18
because then they don't get any feedback

143.06 --> 146.18
exactly again

146.52 --> 151.92000000000002
yeah yeah yeah or what they're saying

149.28 --> 154.319
like if you if it's a living entity if

151.92 --> 157.98
you say something you will get some

154.319 --> 161.51899999999998
response as per what you say right like

157.98 --> 163.26
so so so so so that so that's that's the

161.519 --> 165.66
thing in that case that pressure is not

163.26 --> 167.94
there so exactly it's not going to say

165.66 --> 171.18
anything so that's why it's mute idle

167.94 --> 173.57999999999998
like you know it's uh yeah I get what

171.18 --> 176.76000000000002
you mean now the mute I know I don't

173.58 --> 178.8
think I was uh fully comprehending that

176.76 --> 181.79999999999998
one but now you just put some more

178.8 --> 184.20000000000002
clarity on it and I'm sure yeah others

181.8 --> 186.06
also that read your book will be a very

184.2 --> 188.099
delighted to hear all you have to say

186.06 --> 190.5
about it because now we're getting a

188.099 --> 193.5
Clarity uh directly from the author

190.5 --> 196.099
himself so that's great yes God and pain

193.5 --> 199.099
next God and pain one of the biggest

196.099 --> 202.61999999999998
misconception God is in everyone

199.099 --> 203.879
everywhere everything explain this PD

202.62 --> 206.459
yes

203.879 --> 208.44
okay the thing is that um

206.459 --> 209.70000000000002
uh there's a creation like we have

208.44 --> 210.319
creation okay

209.7 --> 214.14
okay

210.319 --> 217.07999999999998
so people misunderstand creation

214.14 --> 218.64
with this term which is very chord like

217.08 --> 221.22
you know like which is like Divine just

218.64 --> 223.5
use the word divine like okay the

221.22 --> 226.319
creation is created by Divine doesn't

223.5 --> 231.06
mean that everything in it is divine

226.319 --> 232.85999999999999
okay so so it's it's a creation it's

231.06 --> 234.84
it's created like it's but it doesn't

232.86 --> 237.78
mean that uh things can't go

234.84 --> 239.519
in ways where uh it's not following the

237.78 --> 242.159
Divine Law or not following the natural

239.519 --> 243.299
law things can go like that so even

242.159 --> 245.879
though it's part of creation and

243.299 --> 248.15900000000002
creation that is possible okay that

245.879 --> 251.099
possibility is there in creation

248.159 --> 252.959
okay so so to call like uh that uh like

251.099 --> 253.92
this action is also Divine action it's

252.959 --> 256.199
known

253.92 --> 258.239
because Divine is doesn't have some like

256.199 --> 259.5
for example pain like you know like the

258.239 --> 261.78
creation was not created for pain

259.5 --> 264.0
creation was in first created for

261.78 --> 265.55999999999995
pleasure and experience but pleasurable

264.0 --> 269.16
experience not

265.56 --> 270.66
painful experience okay so but the pain

269.16 --> 273.18
Factor has come in

270.66 --> 274.08000000000004
since the laws have been broken in all

273.18 --> 277.56
kinds of

274.08 --> 280.08
things have been done so uh that is part

277.56 --> 282.54
of it now uh but one can't say that is

280.08 --> 285.84
uh like a Divine thing like you know

282.54 --> 288.12
Divine actually doesn't want anyone

285.84 --> 290.46
to be in pain I mean because the whole

288.12 --> 292.5
creation was not created for pain it was

290.46 --> 294.35999999999996
created for having experiences different

292.5 --> 296.3
experiences but pleasurable experiences

294.36 --> 299.04
okay so

296.3 --> 300.6
life is meant to be living yeah it's

299.04 --> 303.72
meant to be live not to be in a cage

300.6 --> 306.0
invisible cage yeah yeah yeah yeah and

303.72 --> 307.56
uh like the Pain part like obviously in

306.0 --> 308.759
a lot of in the western like you know

307.56 --> 310.74
like they have things like no pain no

308.759 --> 313.8
gain and you know they have all these

310.74 --> 315.54
sayings you know like which um confuse

313.8 --> 317.699
people you know

315.54 --> 321.06
so those kind of things have to be

317.699 --> 323.94
obviously addressed and people have to

321.06 --> 326.16
be told that what actually Divine is

323.94 --> 328.919
about and divine is definitely not about

326.16 --> 331.74
pain you know so yeah I don't think pain

328.919 --> 335.94
is absolutely necessary on this in on

331.74 --> 339.24
this realm to activate something but due

335.94 --> 343.08
to the the the system baby loan baby

339.24 --> 346.56
land uh sometimes a bit of pain a bit of

343.08 --> 349.52
trauma a bit of a suffering have have

346.56 --> 351.539
the power also

349.52 --> 353.52
turn people towards the right direction

351.539 --> 355.5
because once you go in the wrong

353.52 --> 360.29999999999995
direction and you get the consequences

355.5 --> 361.979
in form of pain then you can re-evaluate

360.3 --> 364.979
your

361.979 --> 367.38
decision and you can re-evaluate whether

364.979 --> 370.08
you want to go down that road more

367.38 --> 372.44
or not like oh so you come to an

370.08 --> 376.19899999999996
intersection

372.44 --> 378.18
of your life yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so

376.199 --> 380.34000000000003
so then you you have to reevaluate

378.18 --> 383.58
basically so pain is obviously like I

380.34 --> 386.34
said before like uh in uh hell everybody

383.58 --> 388.25899999999996
becomes a good person okay but it has to

386.34 --> 390.29999999999995
be a conscious decision also to

388.259 --> 392.52000000000004
re-evaluate because it's not because you

390.3 --> 395.0
have a tragedy happening to you that

392.52 --> 395.0
you're gonna

397.319 --> 401.40000000000003
but but imagine if some tragedy is

399.3 --> 403.979
happening continuously all the time to

401.4 --> 407.75899999999996
some person then they will

403.979 --> 409.5
do it anyways like I mean it's just that

407.759 --> 412.74
like it doesn't happen so extreme in

409.5 --> 414.24
this realm we are in like it's not one

412.74 --> 416.52
after they are continuously all the time

414.24 --> 419.16
if it was like that then everybody will

416.52 --> 422.21999999999997
reevaluate everybody will everyone will

419.16 --> 423.41900000000004
re-evaluate so yeah and so what I'm

422.22 --> 426.0
saying is when people have got any

423.419 --> 428.639
freedom any time or any freedom or any

426.0 --> 431.96
free will or anything people misuse that

428.639 --> 435.12
okay so pain is just a Nature's Way of

431.96 --> 437.34
pointing out you know

435.12 --> 441.479
action and this is the consequence yeah

437.34 --> 442.919
it's the byproduct of you uh Insanity

441.479 --> 446.099
yeah

442.919 --> 448.979
yeah the byproduct of our Insanity pain

446.099 --> 452.759
and torture yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

448.979 --> 455.46
yeah hey what a good time to uh talk

452.759 --> 459.599
about the next one the Santa Claus and

455.46 --> 461.88
notion okay there are many here

459.599 --> 465.3
because that's a good time it's been

461.88 --> 468.65999999999997
there yesterday when I yeah

465.3 --> 471.90000000000003
like PT I don't think it's a a period of

468.66 --> 474.18
the year that we should not celebrate me

471.9 --> 476.69899999999996
I see it as the coming back of the sun

474.18 --> 479.34000000000003
like the The Rebirth of the sun we're

476.699 --> 482.039
gonna be in summer again soon that's

479.34 --> 484.19899999999996
what I get excited for not for for the

482.039 --> 486.31899999999996
the Pres I get excited for the present

484.199 --> 488.41900000000004
but the present

486.319 --> 492.41900000000004
moments

488.419 --> 494.69899999999996
under the tree like the gift I had it

492.419 --> 496.85999999999996
already like if I won the lotto the gift

494.699 --> 499.5
that the everything the jackpot I have

496.86 --> 502.259
it already what I'm waiting for I'm 33

499.5 --> 504.479
like it makes no sense but celebrating

502.259 --> 508.759
the Sun and all this makes great sense

504.479 --> 511.25899999999996
so tell me a bit the your Santa Claus

508.759 --> 513.1800000000001
you know Santa Clauses like I mean it's

511.259 --> 515.339
it's a it's a kind of a thing in the

513.18 --> 517.7399999999999
west which gives you a thing about

515.339 --> 520.3800000000001
wishing you know like like you wish for

517.74 --> 523.44
a gift you wish and somebody will come

520.38 --> 525.66
and fulfill your wish okay like this uh

523.44 --> 528.0600000000001
notion is very dangerous you know

525.66 --> 530.519
because uh you wish means you'll do some

528.06 --> 533.899
you'll uh wish for something but you

530.519 --> 533.899
will not have to do anything for it

536.0 --> 540.839
that thing will come and uh fulfill all

539.22 --> 542.279
your wishes without you having to do

540.839 --> 545.82
anything for it it creates a very

542.279 --> 548.519
strange mentality which in the long run

545.82 --> 549.899
uh creates a brattiness and it creates a

548.519 --> 553.019
wrong attitude

549.899 --> 555.66
towards life and existence you know so

553.019 --> 558.24
so I think that is uh like a mental

555.66 --> 559.92
programming which is done from like like

558.24 --> 561.48
when people are very young like from

559.92 --> 564.3
three four five six seven eight nine

561.48 --> 565.9200000000001
which stays and people find it hard to

564.3 --> 568.14
break it in the West

565.92 --> 571.2199999999999
this kind of programming which happens

568.14 --> 574.08
with uh so yeah because

571.22 --> 576.5400000000001
we start with uh we start with some tech

574.08 --> 578.58
class when we're young and then when we

576.54 --> 580.74
don't accept Santa Claus no more it's

578.58 --> 582.899
the church or the preacher or someone

580.74 --> 586.32
else like there it seems like there's

582.899 --> 588.899
always something to capture our soul if

586.32 --> 590.0400000000001
we don't free it from that kind of

588.899 --> 592.32
Oppression

590.04 --> 595.279
because the claws are there like I mean

592.32 --> 598.38
because Clause means you know Clause

595.279 --> 600.66
yes Clause because the thing is once you

598.38 --> 602.88
get caught in that cycle of like just

600.66 --> 604.98
wanting wishing you'll always get caught

602.88 --> 606.42
and there'll be a bill afterwards

604.98 --> 608.76
you know but you you're not shown the

606.42 --> 611.16
bill so like so once you take the wish

608.76 --> 613.2
and you accept the thing then you part

611.16 --> 615.3
of you are taken by that the claws have

613.2 --> 618.6
happened to you you know you are in its

615.3 --> 620.8389999999999
claws now now because you'll have to pay

618.6 --> 620.839
for

621.8 --> 627.779
so that's what it means actually like so

624.899 --> 631.14
I mean it's a it's a very um like at a

627.779 --> 632.82
basic psychological level it's a sort of

631.14 --> 634.86
a bondage

632.82 --> 637.5600000000001
you know a bondage at a psychological

634.86 --> 640.6800000000001
level so like which people are trained

637.56 --> 642.66
into from young age yeah it's it's a

640.68 --> 646.26
bond age but it's like you're bound to

642.66 --> 648.8389999999999
the fantasy you know yes fantasy what's

646.26 --> 651.959
the point of living a fantasy

648.839 --> 653.8800000000001
yes and and also it gives you the thing

651.959 --> 656.64
of wishing that wishing is okay

653.88 --> 659.399
that it's good to wish it's okay to wish

656.64 --> 662.22
all the Disney films also like Wish Upon

659.399 --> 663.48
a Star Wish Upon This wish like there's

662.22 --> 666.12
a lot of wishing in all the Disney

663.48 --> 668.16
things and all of that thing and the

666.12 --> 669.42
same the Santa Claus everything is about

668.16 --> 672.66
wishing

669.42 --> 674.0999999999999
you know like you put your uh like socks

672.66 --> 676.14
out and you wish that something will be

674.1 --> 679.019
in them next morning

676.14 --> 681.38
you know like it's all like uh about

679.019 --> 684.24
wishing so that is what the problem is

681.38 --> 687.24
psychologically like so I find those

684.24 --> 688.16
words very interesting which which which

687.24 --> 691.8
which

688.16 --> 693.0
which of these words they all sound like

691.8 --> 695.579
which

693.0 --> 697.2
yeah yeah but the thing is um which is

695.579 --> 699.8389999999999
still means which like you know like

697.2 --> 702.4200000000001
which thing what thing like which thing

699.839 --> 704.0400000000001
like you know which uh but which in

702.42 --> 705.7199999999999
Sanskrit it comes from Sanskrit and

704.04 --> 708.3
Sanskrit it means poison

705.72 --> 712.6800000000001
ah there you go which means poison in

708.3 --> 714.18
Sanskrit okay so so like to wish is a

712.68 --> 716.279
poisonous thing actually it's poisonous

714.18 --> 717.5999999999999
to what is something different

716.279 --> 718.8
when you want something that's different

717.6 --> 721.0790000000001
because when you want something you're

718.8 --> 723.18
ready to do something for it to get it

721.079 --> 725.6999999999999
you make it

723.18 --> 727.8
yeah wishing is like where you just wish

725.7 --> 730.44
but you don't do anything you know you

727.8 --> 732.1999999999999
just wish for it to happen you know I

730.44 --> 735.3800000000001
mean so so yeah

732.2 --> 738.6600000000001
yeah very poisonous

735.38 --> 741.0
so what's happening also uh people wish

738.66 --> 743.9399999999999
to make a change that the world changed

741.0 --> 746.64
that but most people just accumulate

743.94 --> 748.3800000000001
information really without taking action

746.64 --> 750.42
like most people are on the internet

748.38 --> 753.0
just collecting information ordering

750.42 --> 755.3389999999999
information before the the go into

753.0 --> 757.56
action and be the realizator and the

755.339 --> 759.7790000000001
director instead of The Spectator and

757.56 --> 761.579
you know yeah yeah but the point is that

759.779 --> 762.92
for that uh you have to start action

761.579 --> 765.8389999999999
right

762.92 --> 768.8
you gotta face yourself too

765.839 --> 771.72
yeah yeah wishing doesn't do anything

768.8 --> 774.06
wishing is not people are caught in that

771.72 --> 776.279
cycle and I think the Santa Claus thing

774.06 --> 778.1389999999999
is part of that cycle it's part of the

776.279 --> 780.3
programming it's part of that big part

778.139 --> 782.399
of that programming place it's it's a

780.3 --> 784.079
it's a thing which we people have to

782.399 --> 786.54
finally understand that it's a matter of

784.079 --> 790.68
doing not wishing

786.54 --> 793.92
yeah yeah now the next one is also uh

790.68 --> 797.459
it's parked a lot of stuff in my uh in

793.92 --> 801.0
my head there for sure God's Miss image

797.459 --> 804.3
okay because often okay if we talk about

801.0 --> 807.66
God or we talk about uh like often in my

804.3 --> 809.8199999999999
life I heard about alien taking form in

807.66 --> 814.56
human body and stuff like that like it's

809.82 --> 818.22
complete fantasy but I see God taking

814.56 --> 821.5189999999999
Place ear on Earth or the Divine in a

818.22 --> 825.0600000000001
human body but were not ability I think

821.519 --> 828.9590000000001
with our confused mind or ego and stuff

825.06 --> 831.959
to recognize Divine into another being I

828.959 --> 834.2399999999999
think it's the ego it and that's even

831.959 --> 837.2399999999999
mean I put myself in there it's very

834.24 --> 840.9590000000001
hard like PT I see you very very Divine

837.24 --> 843.66
I don't know I might have a children of

840.959 --> 847.3199999999999
God directly sent to me here on YouTube

843.66 --> 849.7199999999999
but I I'm I I don't see it like I you

847.32 --> 851.279
know what I mean yeah yeah but the thing

849.72 --> 852.6600000000001
is for all of that you know because this

851.279 --> 855.3
is a programming and stuff which people

852.66 --> 858.12
have teachers at school for example okay

855.3 --> 860.2199999999999
now you're supposed to look at those

858.12 --> 861.72
teachers at school right you know they

860.22 --> 862.98
are supposedly teaching you something

861.72 --> 867.1800000000001
they're supposed to teach you something

862.98 --> 869.04
right but those beings are not what they

867.18 --> 871.8599999999999
should be for teaching you like you know

869.04 --> 875.519
they are not qualified

871.86 --> 880.1990000000001
actually to teach you so then your uh

875.519 --> 883.019
whole uh sense of uh you know what is uh

880.199 --> 885.54
qualified goals you know what is

883.019 --> 887.519
actually qualified to teach me or you

885.54 --> 890.8199999999999
you know you that sense finishes because

887.519 --> 894.42
of this school system this fake school

890.82 --> 897.12
system this sense actually finishes so

894.42 --> 900.4799999999999
once like we get out of that school

897.12 --> 903.12
system mentality then the things get

900.48 --> 905.04
more clearer actually so people have

903.12 --> 907.68
lost that and then on top of that they

905.04 --> 909.42
spread this lie in school that every one

907.68 --> 911.76
is equal and everyone is that thing you

909.42 --> 913.079
know when T that that's not so like it's

911.76 --> 914.76
different what they're trying to tell

913.079 --> 916.199
you is totally different yeah just

914.76 --> 918.42
because somebody has two eyes one knows

916.199 --> 920.88
and two hands and two legs it doesn't

918.42 --> 924.68
mean it's the same thing you know I mean

920.88 --> 928.38
so so it's it yeah it's it's yeah yeah

924.68 --> 930.2399999999999
many of times those teachers and they

928.38 --> 931.56
should teach themselves personally you

930.24 --> 933.72
know there's something to learn about

931.56 --> 936.4799999999999
life and it's not just in the

933.72 --> 938.12
government's book and stuff like that so

936.48 --> 940.6800000000001
yeah so now

938.12 --> 943.38
so people

940.68 --> 947.279
huh you know about things you know from

943.38 --> 949.38
those fake teachers not so real teachers

947.279 --> 951.18
so then the sense of respect

949.38 --> 952.639
and real respect and real that thing

951.18 --> 956.399
goes away

952.639 --> 958.199
from early age so you you you're not

956.399 --> 960.66
that thing you don't understand the

958.199 --> 963.899
concept anymore that what is actually

960.66 --> 967.56
something which is qualified and

963.899 --> 970.68
actually uh in that position to actually

967.56 --> 973.3199999999999
actually teach you so which which

970.68 --> 976.26
concept is uh very important in this

973.32 --> 978.0600000000001
Multiverse so I mean and they have I

976.26 --> 980.04
find it is deliberately dating a

978.06 --> 982.9799999999999
disrespectful vibe

980.04 --> 985.68
uh in this whole Paradigm you know

982.98 --> 988.019
all the things people see on TV

985.68 --> 990.7199999999999
people see everything and it creates a

988.019 --> 992.639
sense of disrespect as a whole then you

990.72 --> 994.74
don't have to respect anything anyone

992.639 --> 996.0600000000001
any higher being you don't have to there

994.74 --> 999.24
is no higher

996.06 --> 1001.279
you know so all this is done so that

999.24 --> 1003.199
people will never evolve finally okay

1001.279 --> 1004.459
what is the point of all that point is

1003.199 --> 1006.56
that they will not

1004.459 --> 1009.8599999999999
evolve they will not get to a point

1006.56 --> 1012.4399999999999
where they will actually accept reality

1009.86 --> 1014.66
and because if you accept this higher

1012.44 --> 1015.6800000000001
and divine then only you will start

1014.66 --> 1017.24
evolving

1015.68 --> 1019.2199999999999
if you don't think there's anything else

1017.24 --> 1021.32
or anything you are the best and that's

1019.22 --> 1022.94
what it is then you'll just stay at your

1021.32 --> 1024.559
state and you go down from there that's

1022.94 --> 1027.199
there's no other

1024.559 --> 1029.6
point for you to reach basically you

1027.199 --> 1031.459
know there is so they don't give you any

1029.6 --> 1034.9389999999999
kind of goal

1031.459 --> 1036.98
towards bettering yourself yourself and

1034.939 --> 1038.72
raising yourself actually raising

1036.98 --> 1040.16
yourself they don't give you any kind of

1038.72 --> 1042.199
goal for that for that first you have to

1040.16 --> 1043.939
accept that is higher if everyone is

1042.199 --> 1048.319
equal then no one needs to do anything

1043.939 --> 1051.6200000000001
like like I have no there's no point of

1048.319 --> 1054.2
doing nothing and just like have your

1051.62 --> 1056.6
drinks and be merry like you know like

1054.2 --> 1058.5800000000002
it's the conditioning also like you're

1056.6 --> 1060.799
saying we go to school and why do we go

1058.58 --> 1063.799
to school for so long if it's not the

1060.799 --> 1066.86
condition us to think a certain way and

1063.799 --> 1069.08
to see those people that because you

1066.86 --> 1072.08
bring them very young at five-year-old

1069.08 --> 1075.32
in front of an adult that teach them

1072.08 --> 1078.98
things you know so that the children are

1075.32 --> 1080.72
very often like impressed by adult and

1078.98 --> 1083.72
especially if they teach them things

1080.72 --> 1086.0
like they're very in a sense so the

1083.72 --> 1088.4
conditioning starts so young if you have

1086.0 --> 1090.62
I think maybe if you have parents that

1088.4 --> 1093.5
are a little bit more aware and know

1090.62 --> 1096.08
what's going on maybe you cannot like

1093.5 --> 1099.38
I'm a bit aware and I let my children

1096.08 --> 1101.059
know all the stuff that I realize so I

1099.38 --> 1103.46
don't think they go in there with as

1101.059 --> 1105.9189999999999
much a confused mind than the others

1103.46 --> 1109.179
like when you have a bit of awareness of

1105.919 --> 1111.2
what's going on yeah but it's happening

1109.179 --> 1112.4
it's it's happening in the so-called

1111.2 --> 1114.6200000000001
truth or Community as well you know

1112.4 --> 1116.299
there's truth or Community online now on

1114.62 --> 1118.34
YouTube they're also saying they're

1116.299 --> 1120.86
always everybody's saying oh we are all

1118.34 --> 1125.36
equal there's no higher I mean they just

1120.86 --> 1126.74
want to make up like a team of sorts I

1125.36 --> 1129.3799999999999
mean like you can make up any kind of

1126.74 --> 1131.1200000000001
team like but uh like uh like like if

1129.38 --> 1132.8600000000001
you have thousand confused people

1131.12 --> 1134.78
you know that that doesn't mean the

1132.86 --> 1136.76
truth is going to come out or some kind

1134.78 --> 1138.9189999999999
of uh solution is going to come out of

1136.76 --> 1140.419
1000 confused people you can have 10 000

1138.919 --> 1142.76
confused people you can have 100 000

1140.419 --> 1144.6200000000001
confused people but uh solution will not

1142.76 --> 1146.419
come out of that you know

1144.62 --> 1147.86
so so I mean that's what they're trying

1146.419 --> 1150.039
to do in the through the community as

1147.86 --> 1152.539
well they keep on with the same pattern

1150.039 --> 1154.58
what is there I mean and they think that

1152.539 --> 1156.44
they're going against the system okay

1154.58 --> 1159.02
but they are actually playing into the

1156.44 --> 1160.8200000000002
hands of the system split that's what

1159.02 --> 1161.96
the system wants the system doesn't want

1160.82 --> 1165.2
them to think that there is any higher

1161.96 --> 1168.98
ending and that's exactly uh that's what

1165.2 --> 1171.32
exactly these people are doing so like I

1168.98 --> 1174.26
mean um so so then the whole sense of

1171.32 --> 1175.9399999999998
respect and these values or towards and

1174.26 --> 1178.94
divine how to behave and what to do

1175.94 --> 1180.98
action basically uh that is gone like

1178.94 --> 1183.0800000000002
that's not going to be there

1180.98 --> 1184.7
um one can see that in all of this uh

1183.08 --> 1186.26
through the community as well online

1184.7 --> 1188.0
right now and you must have seen

1186.26 --> 1190.7
yourself I mean because you are always

1188.0 --> 1194.9
dealing with these people so you know so

1190.7 --> 1197.48
yeah yeah I think we're all lost in the

1194.9 --> 1199.94
abyss of unawareness pretty much yeah

1197.48 --> 1202.4
unless you take the desire to swim out

1199.94 --> 1206.1200000000001
of there but it's a long it's a deep

1202.4 --> 1207.679
hole sometimes it's an acceptance of

1206.12 --> 1210.62
like that they can be higher forces than

1207.679 --> 1213.26
yourself okay there are higher forces

1210.62 --> 1216.1399999999999
than yourself I mean it's not so hard to

1213.26 --> 1219.5
understand that like I mean it's not you

1216.14 --> 1221.419
know you're not uh at the and especially

1219.5 --> 1224.24
when you're so lost when you saw that

1221.419 --> 1227.179
thing you it should read humility right

1224.24 --> 1229.16
that's what uh all this state you are in

1227.179 --> 1231.6200000000001
shows you that you have to be humble

1229.16 --> 1233.1200000000001
okay like because if you're lost that

1231.62 --> 1235.039
means you have to have Humanity I mean

1233.12 --> 1238.1
if if you were not lost then I mean

1235.039 --> 1240.559
people will be even more proud and I

1238.1 --> 1242.6
wonder how proud they would be when they

1240.559 --> 1245.12
are so proud when they are lost

1242.6 --> 1247.2199999999998
yes but that's what it is where it's

1245.12 --> 1249.559
like we're coherent but with the lower

1247.22 --> 1252.2
self and we're happy with this and we're

1249.559 --> 1254.12
energizing this and you we think it's

1252.2 --> 1256.76
the whole thing but there's something

1254.12 --> 1258.559
much bigger with life like life is

1256.76 --> 1260.6
bigger than my life I've done nothing

1258.559 --> 1262.76
here so far if you think I've done

1260.6 --> 1264.4399999999998
something here on the internet I've done

1262.76 --> 1267.32
nothing it's a brand new day brand new

1264.44 --> 1269.72
celebration we're waking up it's a like

1267.32 --> 1272.32
so you know you have to have that desire

1269.72 --> 1275.179
to evolve also and not

1272.32 --> 1277.22
yeah but for that one has to accept the

1275.179 --> 1279.6200000000001
fact that there is a higher state like

1277.22 --> 1281.9
if one doesn't accept that in the first

1279.62 --> 1284.1789999999999
place and then they one says there can

1281.9 --> 1286.46
be no being at a higher state you know

1284.179 --> 1288.799
or there is no being that's not

1286.46 --> 1291.32
it's not factual it's not real like and

1288.799 --> 1294.62
one has to accept those facts like that

1291.32 --> 1297.6789999999999
one is not a peak of creation like you

1294.62 --> 1300.86
know that one has to learn as to evolve

1297.679 --> 1303.0800000000002
as to find a great teacher and yeah

1300.86 --> 1304.8799999999999
other people like it's other people who

1303.08 --> 1307.34
teach you in life it's not so much life

1304.88 --> 1309.0200000000002
if it's life is our best teacher we

1307.34 --> 1311.0
would have learned by now like I mean

1309.02 --> 1312.44
yeah yeah I mean but the point is that

1311.0 --> 1314.72
is to create humility a sense of

1312.44 --> 1316.94
humility all this structure all this

1314.72 --> 1319.46
problem all this trouble all this thing

1316.94 --> 1323.419
is to teach you humility that you are

1319.46 --> 1325.4
not in charge okay so like and then if

1323.419 --> 1328.039
from that point to get in charge you

1325.4 --> 1329.0590000000002
need to learn okay and then for that you

1328.039 --> 1332.6589999999999
will have to accept that there's

1329.059 --> 1333.98
something more than you okay and for

1332.659 --> 1336.679
that you will have to accept all these

1333.98 --> 1338.6
things and behave accordingly and um

1336.679 --> 1340.94
like and the behavior part I told you

1338.6 --> 1343.34
like it's all like you know uh the way

1340.94 --> 1344.8400000000001
they program on TV it gets you know like

1343.34 --> 1346.28
how to be like walk like hip-hop people

1344.84 --> 1347.72
or these people or this way in

1346.28 --> 1350.12
disgraceful ways and things like that

1347.72 --> 1352.88
everything is to create a sense of uh

1350.12 --> 1354.3799999999999
antagonism towards Aaron Divine if you

1352.88 --> 1356.179
behave like that in towards any higher

1354.38 --> 1357.8600000000001
in Divine you will basically get

1356.179 --> 1360.2
yourself into trouble everything which

1357.86 --> 1362.4799999999998
is taught to people out here is to get

1360.2 --> 1363.74
them into trouble basically

1362.48 --> 1366.26
that's

1363.74 --> 1368.72
exactly the point of it you know yeah

1366.26 --> 1370.64
yes so like sometimes you're at places

1368.72 --> 1372.26
you're deeply in trouble and you don't

1370.64 --> 1374.1200000000001
know you're in trouble like if you're

1372.26 --> 1375.2
distracted all your life you're in big

1374.12 --> 1377.36
trouble

1375.2 --> 1378.74
like but you don't see it because you're

1377.36 --> 1382.3999999999999
distracted and you think that's

1378.74 --> 1383.78
everything uh in life yeah yeah yeah and

1382.4 --> 1385.52
but but the consequences come and people

1383.78 --> 1387.08
think that's normal too and then they

1385.52 --> 1388.28
say like okay consequences campaign

1387.08 --> 1389.8999999999999
comes torture comes they think that's

1388.28 --> 1390.86
normal too that's they say it's part of

1389.9 --> 1393.74
life

1390.86 --> 1395.84
you know they they say it's just part of

1393.74 --> 1398.659
life it's not like that it's not part of

1395.84 --> 1401.12
anything it you are making it that's why

1398.659 --> 1403.3400000000001
it's happening it's not a part of

1401.12 --> 1405.02
something you know like it's it's you

1403.34 --> 1408.08
are creating that you know it's nothing

1405.02 --> 1410.36
which is uh part of anything no you're

1408.08 --> 1412.28
creating your own L and you're creating

1410.36 --> 1413.78
your own ebony early like I mean

1412.28 --> 1416.96
everything is here and now it's up to

1413.78 --> 1419.84
you to take conscious decision also yeah

1416.96 --> 1422.8400000000001
yeah yeah but what's happening also it's

1419.84 --> 1425.48
they want gods of their liking

1422.84 --> 1427.28
that's the other thing you say here not

1425.48 --> 1429.26
that they don't want they don't talk

1427.28 --> 1431.96
about God they don't talk about the but

1429.26 --> 1434.179
they want it to fit their parameter you

1431.96 --> 1437.419
know yes yes and that's very true and

1434.179 --> 1440.0
you can notice that often everywhere yes

1437.419 --> 1442.94
it's and and for that that means uh you

1440.0 --> 1444.86
are more intelligent exactly that God

1442.94 --> 1446.72
and divine you know if it is gonna fix

1444.86 --> 1449.7199999999998
fit your parameters that means it is

1446.72 --> 1452.96
lower than you like it doesn't have

1449.72 --> 1455.24
anything on top of you which it can sort

1452.96 --> 1457.76
of perceive and it has to fit your

1455.24 --> 1459.44
perception so that means you are greater

1457.76 --> 1462.799
than it you know like

1459.44 --> 1466.7
like if it has to be your uh conception

1462.799 --> 1468.32
and conceived notion basically so and

1466.7 --> 1469.5800000000002
that is like putting it down that's

1468.32 --> 1471.08
another way of putting down that's what

1469.58 --> 1472.3999999999999
I'm saying it's another way of getting

1471.08 --> 1474.799
into trouble so

1472.4 --> 1477.02
with with that and divine it's like

1474.799 --> 1479.2
another way of like getting into trouble

1477.02 --> 1481.7
with it like so because

1479.2 --> 1485.24
you rebel against it and you don't know

1481.7 --> 1487.52
also like I I I that's what happened in

1485.24 --> 1489.14
my life pretty much without because you

1487.52 --> 1490.94
don't take a stand you don't raise your

1489.14 --> 1494.3600000000001
voice you don't you know you energize

1490.94 --> 1498.02
lies you energize deceptions and stuff

1494.36 --> 1500.6
without awareness and you have that gift

1498.02 --> 1503.4189999999999
of self-awareness it comes with your

1500.6 --> 1504.6789999999999
being you should be aware if if you're

1503.419 --> 1506.72
not aware

1504.679 --> 1508.88
don't blame it on the government or

1506.72 --> 1510.6200000000001
another blame it on you take the blame

1508.88 --> 1512.24
and make a change that's what I say all

1510.62 --> 1514.3999999999999
the time yeah because

1512.24 --> 1516.02
all of the system and structure and all

1514.4 --> 1518.48
of that is to train you a certain way

1516.02 --> 1521.96
okay that's a training program okay it's

1518.48 --> 1525.14
to train you a certain way okay now but

1521.96 --> 1527.24
you yourself are your trainer so you can

1525.14 --> 1529.279
decide what training you want to undergo

1527.24 --> 1531.44
basically you have to decide what

1529.279 --> 1533.24
training uh you want to go undergo their

1531.44 --> 1534.6200000000001
training which will create this kind of

1533.24 --> 1538.159
thing for you or you can train yourself

1534.62 --> 1539.6589999999999
in your own way which is not part of so

1538.159 --> 1541.5800000000002
that will be a real Rebellion from the

1539.659 --> 1543.44
system which the truth the community

1541.58 --> 1546.1399999999999
should be doing but that's exactly what

1543.44 --> 1547.5800000000002
they don't do you know this their whole

1546.14 --> 1548.96
training stay still stays the system

1547.58 --> 1550.9399999999998
training and then they think that

1548.96 --> 1551.96
they're going against the system you're

1550.94 --> 1553.94
not really going against the system

1551.96 --> 1555.38
unless you change the basic code what is

1553.94 --> 1557.24
the system for

1555.38 --> 1559.3400000000001
I'm staying in one sentence the system

1557.24 --> 1562.58
is there to make sure that you misbehave

1559.34 --> 1564.9189999999999
with higher end okay that's what the

1562.58 --> 1567.02
system is for okay it's created for that

1564.919 --> 1569.0590000000002
purpose okay it has one

1567.02 --> 1570.26
specific purpose only it has no other

1569.059 --> 1572.1789999999999
purpose

1570.26 --> 1575.299
it is to train you in this kind of way

1572.179 --> 1576.38
okay as a whole whether it's a music

1575.299 --> 1578.6
industry whether it's the government

1576.38 --> 1580.5200000000002
whether it's the anything whether it's

1578.6 --> 1581.8999999999999
everything if you put together all the

1580.52 --> 1583.82
signs they teach you all the things they

1581.9 --> 1585.14
put in your head everything is only for

1583.82 --> 1587.4189999999999
one purpose

1585.14 --> 1588.919
okay so if you can't even head out at

1587.419 --> 1592.279
that one purpose

1588.919 --> 1593.24
then you are not like going against it

1592.279 --> 1594.98
and people think that they are so

1593.24 --> 1596.96
against the system and everything

1594.98 --> 1599.96
but they are not really until they come

1596.96 --> 1603.44
to the core issue they are not

1599.96 --> 1606.14
maybe they expect also to see God in a

1603.44 --> 1608.3600000000001
different form than a human being you

1606.14 --> 1610.8200000000002
know of 10 people I think I was like

1608.36 --> 1613.1589999999999
that a lot I was expecting maybe to see

1610.82 --> 1614.72
God in a different form maybe like a

1613.159 --> 1617.0590000000002
different client or something like

1614.72 --> 1619.46
something

1617.059 --> 1622.3999999999999
but but the Divine as can be any form

1619.46 --> 1624.32
like there is no limitation on Divine

1622.4 --> 1625.94
like I mean Divine doesn't have

1624.32 --> 1627.4399999999998
limitations okay so it can be in any

1625.94 --> 1628.8200000000002
form like it can take any form it can

1627.44 --> 1634.039
take the whole form of it can cover the

1628.82 --> 1636.32
whole sky or yeah it can you know

1634.039 --> 1638.12
yeah there is no limitation on it like I

1636.32 --> 1640.279
mean why put limitations on what divine

1638.12 --> 1642.799
can do or can't do like you can do

1640.279 --> 1644.659
whatever like it can it can I mean for

1642.799 --> 1646.039
example if something like a whole covers

1644.659 --> 1648.6200000000001
the whole sky and will people be more

1646.039 --> 1650.6
happy or listen to that okay people

1648.62 --> 1652.1789999999999
might be more scared and run away like I

1650.6 --> 1654.9189999999999
mean it's not

1652.179 --> 1657.02
necessary that people are going to

1654.919 --> 1658.64
listen to that you know like I mean and

1657.02 --> 1661.94
like the truth is right now I will say

1658.64 --> 1662.8400000000001
that that is a hologram and that's a

1661.94 --> 1666.02
um

1662.84 --> 1668.12
that thing I mean uh so I mean you can't

1666.02 --> 1671.6589999999999
please them any which way I mean you

1668.12 --> 1673.76
know like I mean there is no like

1671.659 --> 1676.7
I mean I mean something can be said

1673.76 --> 1678.3799999999999
against anything you know like so you

1676.7 --> 1680.9
know you know when I see the Divine

1678.38 --> 1683.96
force and that like I see the Divine

1680.9 --> 1687.38
force a lot like the wind you can't see

1683.96 --> 1689.419
it but you can't feel it and if you're

1687.38 --> 1691.46
in tune if you're freaking season tune

1689.419 --> 1694.3400000000001
like when the wind come

1691.46 --> 1697.1000000000001
it's gonna affect you it's gonna it's

1694.34 --> 1698.9599999999998
weird how it comes in the in proposal I

1697.1 --> 1701.7199999999998
mean obviously but you have to be open

1698.96 --> 1704.8400000000001
to it but you can't be close to it like

1701.72 --> 1706.94
you know like I mean uh like pretty much

1704.84 --> 1708.1399999999999
right now people think that okay like uh

1706.94 --> 1709.52
they're gonna figure something out

1708.14 --> 1711.74
they're gonna figure this whole out

1709.52 --> 1715.1
without there's no higher Divine Force

1711.74 --> 1716.419
you know like um like uh like um people

1715.1 --> 1718.58
are not saying these things then I'm

1716.419 --> 1719.9
going to align with the Divine Force you

1718.58 --> 1721.279
know I'm going to align with the Divine

1719.9 --> 1723.14
I'm going to align with Divine people

1721.279 --> 1724.76
are not repeating these sentences you

1723.14 --> 1726.8600000000001
know

1724.76 --> 1729.14
yeah yeah and speech I mean people speak

1726.86 --> 1730.3999999999999
a lot of things on YouTube and you see

1729.14 --> 1732.98
around the world know what people speak

1730.4 --> 1736.159
everybody can see that but this sentence

1732.98 --> 1739.82
will not be spoken most of the time like

1736.159 --> 1742.159
you know like no one is gonna speak this

1739.82 --> 1743.6
sentence like and I mean and why are

1742.159 --> 1745.5800000000002
they not speaking that sentence I mean

1743.6 --> 1747.1999999999998
do you not want to align like I mean

1745.58 --> 1748.46
what do you exactly want to do so you

1747.2 --> 1750.559
have to decide

1748.46 --> 1753.2
what you actually want to do and you

1750.559 --> 1755.779
know you speak and behave in two actions

1753.2 --> 1757.52
accordingly yeah that's it it's not

1755.779 --> 1759.559
gonna happen overnight also your

1757.52 --> 1762.3799999999999
alignment that's what I explained uh try

1759.559 --> 1764.96
to guide people into alignment most of

1762.38 --> 1766.94
it like I'm trying to guide myself but

1764.96 --> 1768.799
but you start but you have to have that

1766.94 --> 1770.419
intent first you have to other intent

1768.799 --> 1773.6
that I want

1770.419 --> 1774.5
yeah I want to and then you speak about

1773.6 --> 1777.5
that

1774.5 --> 1778.52
okay yeah so I mean actually I know

1777.5 --> 1780.08
these truth are speaking about that

1778.52 --> 1782.559
aligning with do I know anything with

1780.08 --> 1785.539
that they don't care about that

1782.559 --> 1788.72
yeah but the Earth is more important

1785.539 --> 1790.52
yeah yeah yeah yeah and uh I mean so so

1788.72 --> 1792.2
my point is that like they don't care

1790.52 --> 1793.7
about those things so like you have to

1792.2 --> 1796.5800000000002
first have this intent

1793.7 --> 1798.0800000000002
to actually align with it because uh I

1796.58 --> 1800.1789999999999
mean then what is the system about

1798.08 --> 1802.0
system is about misaligning with it so

1800.179 --> 1806.539
then you have to have a very clear

1802.0 --> 1809.12
opposite view then the system and that

1806.539 --> 1812.179
is the real Rebellion actually right now

1809.12 --> 1813.86
in these times so because the Divine

1812.179 --> 1815.38
Force have

1813.86 --> 1818.059
understand

1815.38 --> 1821.48
itself before it started to create

1818.059 --> 1826.039
something here on Earth so we have to

1821.48 --> 1828.08
understand our being before we start

1826.039 --> 1831.74
creating anything so we there's got to

1828.08 --> 1833.899
be an understanding look inside instead

1831.74 --> 1836.48
of always looking outside and then

1833.899 --> 1840.02
because the Divine the Divine Force

1836.48 --> 1843.26
exactly wants you to know your being to

1840.02 --> 1846.559
to know who you are to like I don't know

1843.26 --> 1849.98
we put that manual so much to first know

1846.559 --> 1852.26
that you are a being yeah I mean like

1849.98 --> 1854.48
first know that I mean because I mean

1852.26 --> 1856.34
for like because most people don't even

1854.48 --> 1858.02
know that like you know they have no

1856.34 --> 1860.299
idea that they're being you know like

1858.02 --> 1861.44
that's that's just not known and the

1860.299 --> 1864.08
fact that the beings have different

1861.44 --> 1865.88
levels that's not known that your being

1864.08 --> 1868.1
is not known the beings have different

1865.88 --> 1869.96
levels that's not known that there's

1868.1 --> 1871.58
different different Divine chords and

1869.96 --> 1874.58
different beings that's not known none

1871.58 --> 1876.9189999999999
of these things basic facts

1874.58 --> 1878.96
are like known to people just like they

1876.919 --> 1880.46
know their name they know their uh car

1878.96 --> 1883.52
they know their house they know their

1880.46 --> 1886.94
that thing they know these things

1883.52 --> 1890.0
more like yeah most people don't want to

1886.94 --> 1892.94
know more than they know at the moment

1890.0 --> 1894.919
to live a happy life like you have to

1892.94 --> 1896.8400000000001
want to to learn and stuff it's

1894.919 --> 1898.279
something but happiness they don't have

1896.84 --> 1900.3799999999999
like happiness you can't have in this

1898.279 --> 1902.659
life with those things people can't be

1900.38 --> 1904.5200000000002
happy so if they were so happy they

1902.659 --> 1905.96
won't need all these uh alcohol and

1904.52 --> 1908.6
these antidepressants and these

1905.96 --> 1910.94
Pharmaceuticals and uh all these things

1908.6 --> 1913.1
you know like if they were happy like

1910.94 --> 1915.679
they wouldn't have to be in such a

1913.1 --> 1918.02
miserable sort of uh State like you know

1915.679 --> 1921.3200000000002
like so happiness is totally far from

1918.02 --> 1923.72
people okay like that is very very far

1921.32 --> 1925.8799999999999
concept like so but some people will

1923.72 --> 1929.26
pretend that they're a PPT there you go

1925.88 --> 1929.2600000000002
ask them you tell them

1930.159 --> 1936.5590000000002
but they're popping a couple of pills

1933.52 --> 1938.4189999999999
too like you know like like yeah they're

1936.559 --> 1940.6399999999999
probably on bills or something Have

1938.419 --> 1942.3200000000002
smokes yeah and and then people in all

1940.64 --> 1945.22
kind of drugs and people need uh this

1942.32 --> 1945.22
thing that they need Mariano

1947.74 --> 1953.659
you know like you know so like so an

1951.44 --> 1955.64
indication that someone has inner

1953.659 --> 1957.74
happiness or inner Bliss or something

1955.64 --> 1960.3200000000002
like that would be someone that is not

1957.74 --> 1963.1
also distracted and someone else and

1960.32 --> 1963.1
someone on service

1963.2 --> 1967.22
yeah and they they won't be relying on

1965.539 --> 1970.6
all these things like they won't be

1967.22 --> 1974.659
relying on all this uh Pharma system and

1970.6 --> 1978.02
this like all these things like alcohol

1974.659 --> 1979.7600000000002
and I mean I mean how many people are

1978.02 --> 1983.059
drinking alcohol in Canada like I mean

1979.76 --> 1985.22
how many percentage it's terrible you go

1983.059 --> 1988.279
you go in the store you're just in the

1985.22 --> 1991.159
village look they have brought the the

1988.279 --> 1992.84
SAQ which is the the big place here in

1991.159 --> 1995.1200000000001
Quebec the government thing that takes

1992.84 --> 1997.34
care of the alcohol they brought it in

1995.12 --> 2000.299
the village 5 000 people in the village

1997.34 --> 2003.1589999999999
here now we have the seq government

2000.299 --> 2006.36
alcohol office right in the grocery

2003.159 --> 2010.24
store with all the hard stuff yeah

2006.36 --> 2011.9189999999999
yeah so put it or at least put it far so

2010.24 --> 2015.58
people have to do an effort for their

2011.919 --> 2017.5590000000002
Madness yeah yeah but but we're so happy

2015.58 --> 2020.26
if they're so happy then they won't need

2017.559 --> 2023.019
that right yeah so if they are so happy

2020.26 --> 2025.419
all these people you know and um like

2023.019 --> 2027.159
and and people are mostly like happiness

2025.419 --> 2029.44
is a very far thing for people out there

2027.159 --> 2031.8990000000001
because you are in all the system you

2029.44 --> 2033.7
are in this thing you are uh in all this

2031.899 --> 2035.62
trouble and people are just uh

2033.7 --> 2037.48
continuously filling out forms and this

2035.62 --> 2039.82
thing and this thing and that thing and

2037.48 --> 2043.059
you know this survival

2039.82 --> 2045.8799999999999
itself is a problem and the beings which

2043.059 --> 2047.2
like may have more uh like finances or

2045.88 --> 2049.48
whatever they still

2047.2 --> 2050.619
have nothing else to do they get bored

2049.48 --> 2052.419
and then they get

2050.619 --> 2054.8790000000004
into drugs and all kinds of things you

2052.419 --> 2057.879
know and so it's like

2054.879 --> 2059.98
overall obviously happiness is not the

2057.879 --> 2062.919
thing here at all I mean people can

2059.98 --> 2064.899
pretend to just be functioning

2062.919 --> 2067.419
you know but even they can't pretend

2064.899 --> 2068.679
very well at that like you know it's I

2067.419 --> 2070.839
mean if you have some perception you can

2068.679 --> 2072.28
see through all of that like so like I

2070.839 --> 2074.379
mean perception allows you to see

2072.28 --> 2076.8990000000003
through all of potential which people do

2074.379 --> 2079.06
so yeah so sometimes they will pretend

2076.899 --> 2081.22
also the AIP but there's all kinds of

2079.06 --> 2083.2599999999998
Madness around like very stressed out

2081.22 --> 2085.72
very depressed very

2083.26 --> 2088.3
um pills alcohol distraction again

2085.72 --> 2091.1789999999996
that's not happiness is the road the

2088.3 --> 2092.619
iron Divine at least I want to feel

2091.179 --> 2095.139
something

2092.619 --> 2097.06
yeah but happiness is very far from

2095.139 --> 2098.5
people and like because happiness only

2097.06 --> 2101.2599999999998
comes when you are actually evolving

2098.5 --> 2102.4
exactly happiness is only possible when

2101.26 --> 2104.0200000000004
you're evolving because then you're

2102.4 --> 2106.54
gonna be happy okay because you know

2104.02 --> 2107.98
that you're evolving so you are you feel

2106.54 --> 2109.54
good like you know like about that

2107.98 --> 2112.96
you're doing something right or good and

2109.54 --> 2117.04
then like you are yeah I'm very happy to

2112.96 --> 2117.04
be here with you foreign

2121.98 --> 2127.48
okay there is no other time happiness is

2125.38 --> 2129.119
possible okay okay like that's that's an

2127.48 --> 2132.339
impossibility that you can be happy

2129.119 --> 2134.26
while you know like it's it's it's

2132.339 --> 2137.68
because happiness is about that feeling

2134.26 --> 2139.6600000000003
only which you feel okay you are rising

2137.68 --> 2142.2999999999997
that feeling of rising and raising is

2139.66 --> 2143.6189999999997
happiness okay there is no it is the

2142.3 --> 2145.3
name for that feeling

2143.619 --> 2148.359
okay happiness is the name for that

2145.3 --> 2150.46
feeling only so nothing else can be

2148.359 --> 2152.2
called Happiness and it's not happiness

2150.46 --> 2155.8
I mean it's more pain and torture than

2152.2 --> 2158.3799999999997
yeah so so so so we clear the definition

2155.8 --> 2160.9
of Happiness here like yeah yeah no I

2158.38 --> 2163.599
think we we you gave me a lot of clarity

2160.9 --> 2168.04
into other people too I'm sure next the

2163.599 --> 2170.7400000000002
judges of greatness I love that one this

2168.04 --> 2173.8
one is rewind the judges of greatness

2170.74 --> 2176.5
yeah yeah the Stars the moon the sun you

2173.8 --> 2179.02
know we have a conception but there's a

2176.5 --> 2181.18
lot of I think we judge each other way

2179.02 --> 2184.119
too much no we crucify each other on the

2181.18 --> 2186.52
public place which is crazy but the

2184.119 --> 2189.099
judges the real judges of greatness the

2186.52 --> 2191.56
go into nature connect with nature right

2189.099 --> 2192.94
PT yeah yeah I mean judges of greatness

2191.56 --> 2194.2
in the sense that like people think that

2192.94 --> 2195.4
they can judge greatness out there

2194.2 --> 2199.06
that's why you know like they've put so

2195.4 --> 2201.2200000000003
many false idols on screen and on stage

2199.06 --> 2202.66
and all of that you know so people think

2201.22 --> 2204.5789999999997
that that's great or that was great and

2202.66 --> 2206.44
this was great and you know but there

2204.579 --> 2208.6600000000003
was nothing great there actually it was

2206.44 --> 2210.64
all nonsense but uh like they find

2208.66 --> 2212.14
nonsense great you know like anybody

2210.64 --> 2213.64
who's doing more nonsense is more great

2212.14 --> 2217.359
because they're doing more nonsense than

2213.64 --> 2219.8199999999997
other people like so like yeah so so

2217.359 --> 2221.92
that these parameters of greatness also

2219.82 --> 2224.32
are again need to be looked into

2221.92 --> 2226.78
what people and obviously because it's

2224.32 --> 2228.46
disconnected in nature so their

2226.78 --> 2232.1800000000003
parameters of greatness will always be

2228.46 --> 2234.04
very unnatural and very nonsensical so

2232.18 --> 2235.66
that that's what happens in this world

2234.04 --> 2238.54
you know you you can see that everywhere

2235.66 --> 2240.8199999999997
like you know people find that okay I

2238.54 --> 2243.339
see greatness in people but often the

2240.82 --> 2245.8
greatness turn into madness because the

2243.339 --> 2249.18
heart is twisted and like the hardest

2245.8 --> 2249.1800000000003
the mind is a bit

2253.74 --> 2258.339
the more great it is considered like you

2256.06 --> 2259.839
know you know so so somebody's going bad

2258.339 --> 2261.46
on stage more than you can then you

2259.839 --> 2262.839
think oh if this person is so great

2261.46 --> 2264.76
because it's going more mad than I am

2262.839 --> 2266.44
like so like

2264.76 --> 2268.78
yeah yeah

2266.44 --> 2272.2200000000003
that's the conditioning the thinking

2268.78 --> 2272.2200000000003
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2272.4 --> 2277.599
we see people and we think they're great

2275.02 --> 2280.54
but after an open just opened the TV

2277.599 --> 2283.3
most of the time you see the the Wicket

2280.54 --> 2285.22
being reward on TV yeah but I mean

2283.3 --> 2287.619
obviously like if anybody undergoes pain

2285.22 --> 2290.2
and torture people will see it like it's

2287.619 --> 2292.06
like a it's it's almost uh you know like

2290.2 --> 2292.96
where people like to see others

2292.06 --> 2296.38
suffering

2292.96 --> 2299.5
so whosoever is suffering on stage then

2296.38 --> 2301.599
people will clap for it you know you

2299.5 --> 2303.579
know it's a it's a statistic kind of

2301.599 --> 2306.54
thing you know it's just more sadistic

2303.579 --> 2310.96
kind of yeah because

2306.54 --> 2314.619
why everybody feels weird with public

2310.96 --> 2317.38
speaking explain that to me why everyone

2314.619 --> 2321.099
pretty much before getting on stage

2317.38 --> 2323.339
feels weird that nervousness and this is

2321.099 --> 2326.44
not normal uh this is not because

2323.339 --> 2327.5789999999997
because they're not supposed to be there

2326.44 --> 2329.7400000000002
they're not supposed to be there they

2327.579 --> 2330.579
have nothing to say come on that's what

2329.74 --> 2332.3199999999997
it is

2330.579 --> 2334.6600000000003
yeah yeah because you're not supposed to

2332.32 --> 2335.8590000000004
be there no they're not supposed to uh

2334.66 --> 2338.3199999999997
be saying those things or they're not

2335.859 --> 2340.18
they have nothing to say like I mean

2338.32 --> 2341.8590000000004
really I mean they've got nothing to say

2340.18 --> 2343.4199999999996
but they've been put there so obviously

2341.859 --> 2344.56
like you will feel nervous and stuff

2343.42 --> 2346.839
because you're not supposed to be doing

2344.56 --> 2348.88
that thing you know like if you actually

2346.839 --> 2350.32
have something to like that's where like

2348.88 --> 2351.94
uh people will obviously feel they're

2350.32 --> 2353.7400000000002
doing something wrong you know because

2351.94 --> 2355.839
their inner feeling will be there that

2353.74 --> 2358.18
you are doing something wrong by going

2355.839 --> 2359.56
up there you know like and you know that

2358.18 --> 2362.14
you know different from all the people

2359.56 --> 2363.64
who are down there or you don't actually

2362.14 --> 2366.52
know anything more than the people down

2363.64 --> 2368.0789999999997
there but you still are on that pedestal

2366.52 --> 2369.28
and that Podium and that thing and you

2368.079 --> 2372.3390000000004
know now you have to speak and now you

2369.28 --> 2374.5
have to make something up and

2372.339 --> 2376.18
and say something and that stuff like I

2374.5 --> 2379.18
mean it's a tough thing to do and it's

2376.18 --> 2380.44
not natural and it's obviously creates

2379.18 --> 2383.0789999999997
tension and

2380.44 --> 2388.839
you know it creates this feeling of

2383.079 --> 2390.7000000000003
like anxiety and anxiety yes yes no

2388.839 --> 2392.56
because I was wondering I'm like because

2390.7 --> 2394.2999999999997
I hear that from a lot of people they

2392.56 --> 2396.52
say they they're nervous before getting

2394.3 --> 2398.98
on stage and everything yeah I'm like

2396.52 --> 2401.2
what but don't go I mean who's telling

2398.98 --> 2402.88
you to I mean where is who's telling you

2401.2 --> 2405.339
to do that I mean who's telling you to

2402.88 --> 2407.079
go out there and do that I mean you

2405.339 --> 2409.0
don't have to get on stage if you're not

2407.079 --> 2410.8
meant to be and if you don't know if you

2409.0 --> 2412.42
don't have some clarity you only just go

2410.8 --> 2413.5
on stage like if you make announcement

2412.42 --> 2414.579
or something you have to make an

2413.5 --> 2416.8
announcement only when you're clear

2414.579 --> 2420.3390000000004
about something okay people this is this

2416.8 --> 2422.44
okay flood is coming or this is fire is

2420.339 --> 2425.2
happening or something some fact you are

2422.44 --> 2427.48
clear about factual which you want to be

2425.2 --> 2429.3999999999996
informed people about you know like or

2427.48 --> 2431.619
something which you have very clear that

2429.4 --> 2433.839
I figured out this you're giving a

2431.619 --> 2435.28
solution otherwise what's the point of

2433.839 --> 2437.7999999999997
you going on

2435.28 --> 2439.96
stage of any kind of this world like you

2437.8 --> 2441.4
know there is no point exactly but I

2439.96 --> 2443.8
mean that but that has become like like

2441.4 --> 2447.099
a profession now you know it's not a

2443.8 --> 2450.48
it's it's too many so many speakers

2447.099 --> 2453.52
today motivational speakers

2450.48 --> 2455.079
yeah I mean I mean it's all came from

2453.52 --> 2458.079
this music industry I mean people caught

2455.079 --> 2459.82
on stage with the I mean they were the

2458.079 --> 2461.079
original motivational speakers and all

2459.82 --> 2463.7200000000003
of that I mean they are the people who

2461.079 --> 2465.6400000000003
are you know like there with the things

2463.72 --> 2467.68
and I mean and they don't know why they

2465.64 --> 2469.42
are there you know and then a lot of

2467.68 --> 2471.0989999999997
them start like and all of their lives

2469.42 --> 2472.1800000000003
are very undisciplined and you know

2471.099 --> 2473.92
those are the people who are taking more

2472.18 --> 2476.44
drugs and drinking more alcohol or

2473.92 --> 2478.0
smoking more Potter like those people

2476.44 --> 2479.8
are doing

2478.0 --> 2481.18
the ones who are on stage have to do it

2479.8 --> 2484.599
even more you know than normal people

2481.18 --> 2485.44
like so like it's it's a it's a very

2484.599 --> 2487.839
very

2485.44 --> 2490.42
yeah great yeah so uh the other one

2487.839 --> 2492.82
after was uh greater than God but we've

2490.42 --> 2495.16
touched a bit the the topic just earlier

2492.82 --> 2496.78
we said it to people it's solved in

2495.16 --> 2500.0789999999997
their mind and they're greater than God

2496.78 --> 2502.0600000000004
So Divine and praising and serving iron

2500.079 --> 2504.82
Divine and getting on your knees and

2502.06 --> 2508.48
stuff like that it's far from their mind

2504.82 --> 2510.2400000000002
even so yeah yeah yeah so you have to

2508.48 --> 2513.76
want to

2510.24 --> 2516.4599999999996
have some kind of Salvation Redemption I

2513.76 --> 2518.7000000000003
don't know if it's the word but there is

2516.46 --> 2522.64
something you have to repent

2518.7 --> 2524.14
repent or repent repent serpent depend

2522.64 --> 2527.02
means that you have to get towards a

2524.14 --> 2530.02
right attitude the correct great

2527.02 --> 2531.579
attitude take out yeah even if you have

2530.02 --> 2533.92
wrong attitude before it doesn't matter

2531.579 --> 2536.619
as long as you are ready to change right

2533.92 --> 2539.38
it does not matter what was there like

2536.619 --> 2543.46
as long as you already changed so it's a

2539.38 --> 2544.7200000000003
yeah and it takes a sort of like that uh

2543.46 --> 2547.96
courage

2544.72 --> 2549.9399999999996
to do that first you know so like yeah

2547.96 --> 2552.7
because like you say here also it's the

2549.94 --> 2555.2200000000003
ability to recognize the Divine into

2552.7 --> 2556.2599999999998
someone like I recognize it in new uh

2555.22 --> 2558.64
big time

2556.26 --> 2560.619
but for that one should go into nature

2558.64 --> 2563.14
first if one connects with nature then

2560.619 --> 2565.119
it's easier to recognize anything

2563.14 --> 2567.7599999999998
like for beings who connect with nature

2565.119 --> 2569.02
it's easier to recognize Divine okay but

2567.76 --> 2570.579
the beings who do not connect with

2569.02 --> 2571.48
nature at all for them it will be

2570.579 --> 2574.42
tougher

2571.48 --> 2576.46
okay so it's like people should get in

2574.42 --> 2578.98
front of a being like you and seriously

2576.46 --> 2582.099
just listen that's what I would do like

2578.98 --> 2584.14
if I if I would not know you if I would

2582.099 --> 2586.6600000000003
not know you and I would get to I would

2584.14 --> 2589.0
just man I would be like I would just

2586.66 --> 2591.94
listen to your words because you you're

2589.0 --> 2594.28
so clear and so uh if I you know to

2591.94 --> 2595.839
express what I think about upt they're

2594.28 --> 2597.28
really an expressive in English I would

2595.839 --> 2599.56
have to read some of the comments

2597.28 --> 2601.6800000000003
because it really resonates with me and

2599.56 --> 2604.119
people are uh yeah for sure

2601.68 --> 2606.339
acknowledging the fact that you are very

2604.119 --> 2608.56
Divine and that's so the point is that

2606.339 --> 2609.5789999999997
it's it's the people who acknowledge

2608.56 --> 2611.2
that are the ones who are really

2609.579 --> 2613.0
concerned about the revolution okay

2611.2 --> 2615.46
finally people have to be concerned

2613.0 --> 2617.079
about their evolution if they are

2615.46 --> 2618.76
concerned about the revolution then they

2617.079 --> 2620.8
will do the thing if a beings are not

2618.76 --> 2623.079
really concerned about what happens to

2620.8 --> 2624.76
them you know then that's where the

2623.079 --> 2626.44
problem lies you know first you have to

2624.76 --> 2628.0
become concerned

2626.44 --> 2631.38
you know I think there is a p-log about

2628.0 --> 2634.359
like like my book concerns

2631.38 --> 2637.06
you have to become concerned about your

2634.359 --> 2639.16
own future

2637.06 --> 2641.2599999999998
you know and your present and future

2639.16 --> 2643.0
both you have to be concerned about that

2641.26 --> 2644.3190000000004
I mean that sense of concern has to come

2643.0 --> 2646.24
like because most people have their

2644.319 --> 2648.88
sense of concerns only like okay if I

2646.24 --> 2652.4399999999996
grow old then uh I'll get my you know

2648.88 --> 2655.119
whether I'll get my attention or not

2652.44 --> 2657.88
if the check's coming in or if I have

2655.119 --> 2660.04
enough job to yeah yeah yeah yeah so

2657.88 --> 2662.1400000000003
they have concern like that that's also

2660.04 --> 2664.24
future concept it's okay to have some

2662.14 --> 2666.339
future concern like that okay but but

2664.24 --> 2668.14
that's not the end of it that's not

2666.339 --> 2670.96
which is going to save you or create

2668.14 --> 2673.06
anything good for you like uh your uh

2670.96 --> 2675.099
check is not gonna stop a diseases from

2673.06 --> 2677.02
happening to you is going to stop your

2675.099 --> 2679.7200000000003
mind from going crazy it's not going to

2677.02 --> 2680.56
stop your memory to go it's not going to

2679.72 --> 2684.5789999999997
stop

2680.56 --> 2685.66
so many things you know like so so the

2684.579 --> 2687.099
concern should be something more

2685.66 --> 2689.7999999999997
holistic

2687.099 --> 2690.94
than just uh like uh survival through

2689.8 --> 2693.599
money

2690.94 --> 2696.339
yeah the first concern is for your home

2693.599 --> 2699.94
the body we trash it with so much

2696.339 --> 2701.56
nonsense that's not uh first of all the

2699.94 --> 2703.359
first thing the Divine wants you to do

2701.56 --> 2705.22
is take care of your body if not that's

2703.359 --> 2707.74
your vehicle that's what you should have

2705.22 --> 2709.8999999999996
maintenance for and change the oil and

2707.74 --> 2712.06
all that stuff that's the body you know

2709.9 --> 2715.119
the that's what the Divine wants us to

2712.06 --> 2717.819
do at first and really be strong within

2715.119 --> 2720.2200000000003
ourselves and so that we can raise our

2717.819 --> 2722.14
voice and reach others with our

2720.22 --> 2723.7599999999998
vibration you know the vibration is

2722.14 --> 2725.98
there so yeah because it's a body mind

2723.76 --> 2728.079
Spirit thing so obviously you have to

2725.98 --> 2729.22
have concern about all three in total

2728.079 --> 2733.0
but starting with the body first

2729.22 --> 2736.14
obviously yeah temples temples I think

2733.0 --> 2739.66
we have a bit of a but again it's normal

2736.14 --> 2742.42
it's normal in our world to find temples

2739.66 --> 2745.359
outside of ourselves outside of our

2742.42 --> 2747.819
bodies because we're not too much inside

2745.359 --> 2750.22
of ourselves so we're more projecting on

2747.819 --> 2751.42
the outside so we find all kinds of

2750.22 --> 2754.0789999999997
temples but

2751.42 --> 2756.579
yes because it takes it takes discipline

2754.079 --> 2758.619
because why we people do that is because

2756.579 --> 2761.8
it takes discipline to take care of your

2758.619 --> 2763.42
own body it takes discipline right to go

2761.8 --> 2764.44
to the outside Temple doesn't take my

2763.42 --> 2766.599
discipline

2764.44 --> 2769.54
you just go out there and you just like

2766.599 --> 2771.6400000000003
a tourist you visit that okay it doesn't

2769.54 --> 2773.98
you can be in any which way you can just

2771.64 --> 2776.2
go out there and it it does it

2773.98 --> 2778.06
eliminates the need for discipline

2776.2 --> 2780.2799999999997
or daily discipline

2778.06 --> 2783.22
and you'll go once in a while

2780.28 --> 2784.96
to the temple so that's fine you know

2783.22 --> 2786.7599999999998
body you'll have to take care of daily

2784.96 --> 2789.4
right

2786.76 --> 2791.38
so so body body is much more tougher

2789.4 --> 2792.7000000000003
like so people like to take the easier

2791.38 --> 2794.859
way out they think it's the easier way

2792.7 --> 2796.839
out like do once in a while go to some

2794.859 --> 2797.92
kind of Temple Church or whatever mosque

2796.839 --> 2799.599
or whatever they call it there are

2797.92 --> 2800.92
different kind of temples in a Jewish

2799.599 --> 2803.56
temple this thing that thing whatever

2800.92 --> 2806.2000000000003
say no gogs whatever they're called so

2803.56 --> 2808.839
like those things so they find it easy

2806.2 --> 2810.3999999999996
to go once in a while to some structure

2808.839 --> 2813.2799999999997
then actually dealing with the

2810.4 --> 2816.04
discipline of your own body right

2813.28 --> 2819.099
I mean it's easier it seems easier to

2816.04 --> 2820.7799999999997
them to just pair like a visit there

2819.099 --> 2822.6400000000003
sometimes which is like a tourist you

2820.78 --> 2825.099
can do that I mean and you're used to

2822.64 --> 2828.64
paying visits to school

2825.099 --> 2828.6400000000003
University offices

2829.06 --> 2833.98
um these kind of you're used to these

2830.92 --> 2837.099
visits anyways so this is one more visit

2833.98 --> 2839.38
like that so yeah exactly you visit

2837.099 --> 2842.8590000000004
stuff outside of yourself always and

2839.38 --> 2845.7400000000002
that's I think the most the most the

2842.859 --> 2849.04
highest Temple the most uh inspiring

2845.74 --> 2849.819
Temple you'll ever enters though your

2849.04 --> 2851.619
head

2849.819 --> 2853.359
yeah yeah I mean that's why these are 10

2851.619 --> 2855.339
Temple bones these called Temple bones

2853.359 --> 2856.9
these bones are called Temple just

2855.339 --> 2860.5789999999997
called your temple like

2856.9 --> 2863.14
so I don't know we can have a great uh

2860.579 --> 2867.28
inspiration once we tap into it for sure

2863.14 --> 2868.56
and uh the next term here you go with is

2867.28 --> 2872.7400000000002
Holy

2868.56 --> 2875.7999999999997
h-o-l-y and holy because I think this is

2872.74 --> 2877.5989999999997
again conditioning to create holy sounds

2875.8 --> 2879.819
like a hole there's a hole you know

2877.599 --> 2883.7200000000003
there's something is missing there's a

2879.819 --> 2885.22
hole but when you're old then easier to

2883.72 --> 2887.5
connect also once you feel the whole

2885.22 --> 2890.3999999999996
yeah that's that's a deliberate thing

2887.5 --> 2890.4
that we're taking out

2898.92 --> 2904.1800000000003
okay so people would understand that but

2901.96 --> 2905.619
if the W you take out then you take out

2904.18 --> 2907.48
that from the Consciousness so like if

2905.619 --> 2910.1800000000003
at school you could learn that word holy

2907.48 --> 2911.8
with the blue then you will have a

2910.18 --> 2915.2799999999997
different picture of that word

2911.8 --> 2917.1400000000003
okay what it means yeah yeah I have

2915.28 --> 2921.2400000000002
something to ask you because I see it

2917.14 --> 2924.2799999999997
here you you're mentioning holy word not

2921.24 --> 2926.2
woollywood not Hollywood but now there's

2924.28 --> 2928.8390000000004
a phenomena that's happening in Indian

2926.2 --> 2932.319
that's where you're from and it's bully

2928.839 --> 2935.68
wood and there's a massive massive

2932.319 --> 2938.2599999999998
amount of movies coming out of India

2935.68 --> 2940.18
like it has been happening for the last

2938.26 --> 2943.0600000000004
30 40 years uh yeah but the thing is

2940.18 --> 2945.22
that uh like it is uh you know just

2943.06 --> 2946.74
another kind of nonsense you know in

2945.22 --> 2951.1189999999997
every country they create some sort of

2946.74 --> 2951.1189999999997
uh to keep people distracted

2953.339 --> 2958.66
yeah entertainment uh that uh that

2956.8 --> 2960.2200000000003
people will be distracted and nonsense

2958.66 --> 2961.7799999999997
we showed to them so that they don't

2960.22 --> 2964.1189999999997
learn anything they don't get anything

2961.78 --> 2966.1600000000003
and all the value system in it will be

2964.119 --> 2968.44
all nonsensical nothing no movement

2966.16 --> 2971.74
towards higher and divine basically

2968.44 --> 2974.859
in it so so that that kind of thing you

2971.74 --> 2976.7799999999997
know that's Bali uh like I mean uh it is

2974.859 --> 2978.2799999999997
uh just like uh you know Hollywood did

2976.78 --> 2980.7400000000002
it for the West

2978.28 --> 2982.96
Bollywood is doing it for Indians upon

2980.74 --> 2985.54
in other areas you know it's it's it's

2982.96 --> 2986.92
it's I mean uh it's been going on for a

2985.54 --> 2988.72
while and

2986.92 --> 2991.48
it's all about racelessness it's about

2988.72 --> 2993.8799999999997
putting gracelessness on screen so that

2991.48 --> 2996.52
people copy that and become gracious in

2993.88 --> 2997.9
their own being okay which is the same

2996.52 --> 3000.9
process which is happening all around

2997.9 --> 3003.119
the earth like so it's it's all

3000.9 --> 3005.819
happening all over so like it's

3003.119 --> 3008.04
programming people yeah but I found that

3005.819 --> 3010.5
interesting because it's not just a

3008.04 --> 3012.96
little bit of movie production it's huge

3010.5 --> 3016.859
it seems to be very huge the the movie

3012.96 --> 3020.4
thing in India you see a lot online it's

3016.859 --> 3022.74
I was like wow it's so huge because uh

3020.4 --> 3025.619
the thing is when people's lives normal

3022.74 --> 3026.9399999999996
lives you know become very dull and

3025.619 --> 3029.339
uninspiring

3026.94 --> 3030.619
you know then they need more fantasy

3029.339 --> 3033.54
right

3030.619 --> 3035.52
that's it okay when your normal life

3033.54 --> 3038.46
becomes very dull and uninspiring then

3035.52 --> 3040.38
you need fantasy to somehow that thing

3038.46 --> 3042.54
because your life is so tough and so you

3040.38 --> 3044.46
need just an escape so these movies are

3042.54 --> 3045.7799999999997
made as like an escape for two and a

3044.46 --> 3047.04
half three hours like they're very long

3045.78 --> 3049.559
as well they're not one and a half hours

3047.04 --> 3051.359
yeah two and a half hours and that thing

3049.559 --> 3054.96
is so that people can escape

3051.359 --> 3057.359
into some parallel reality or strange

3054.96 --> 3059.819
that thing for a while like you know

3057.359 --> 3063.18
like so that it's an escapism it's a

3059.819 --> 3065.7
kind of drug like which is yeah like um

3063.18 --> 3067.9199999999996
like which is uh which people fall prey

3065.7 --> 3069.72
to because uh they cannot cope with

3067.92 --> 3072.059
their actual life they can't cope with

3069.72 --> 3073.5589999999997
the facts of their own existence right

3072.059 --> 3075.059
now which when they look at their own

3073.559 --> 3078.1800000000003
existence they don't feel so good they

3075.059 --> 3081.119
feel bad okay and they don't know what

3078.18 --> 3083.22
to do about it how to improve their

3081.119 --> 3085.2000000000003
situation so instead of improving their

3083.22 --> 3086.819
situation they fall prey to this fantasy

3085.2 --> 3088.02
which is shown on the screen you know so

3086.819 --> 3092.24
for three hours you can forget about

3088.02 --> 3096.74
your life you know and go into a

3092.24 --> 3096.74
parallel universe like exactly

3097.579 --> 3101.28
nothing makes sense out there you know

3099.66 --> 3102.8999999999996
in that movie like every 10 minutes

3101.28 --> 3104.8190000000004
things are just changing into like it's

3102.9 --> 3105.9
like a dream you know in a dream one

3104.819 --> 3108.839
thing happens another thing happens

3105.9 --> 3110.76
there's no coherent structure to it you

3108.839 --> 3112.319
know it's not like it makes sense from

3110.76 --> 3114.0
five minutes to five minutes to five

3112.319 --> 3115.92
minutes it's like that and they make it

3114.0 --> 3117.42
like a dream only and that's why it's

3115.92 --> 3120.78
called Dream works isn't it in the west

3117.42 --> 3123.3
you know that company yeah you know it's

3120.78 --> 3126.2400000000002
like DreamWorks yeah that's the one of

3123.3 --> 3129.96
the movie production people yeah yeah

3126.24 --> 3132.54
yeah no so it's all the manufacture some

3129.96 --> 3134.46
kind of fake reality for sure we know it

3132.54 --> 3136.98
but I found that very interesting

3134.46 --> 3139.44
because in zero seems to be a very big

3136.98 --> 3141.9
producer lately of movies

3139.44 --> 3142.98
so and there's other Woods as well in

3141.9 --> 3145.079
India like there's tollywood Hollywood

3142.98 --> 3148.68
all kinds of things you know there are a

3145.079 --> 3151.44
lot of other ones too so it's it's not

3148.68 --> 3153.4199999999996
just that like so but to have that much

3151.44 --> 3156.18
movie that there's got to be a market I

3153.42 --> 3159.48
mean people consume that stuff they so

3156.18 --> 3162.02
the the movie thing in India people must

3159.48 --> 3164.339
consume it a lot

3162.02 --> 3168.3
since now YouTube is coming

3164.339 --> 3169.98
it'll be less you know this is baby less

3168.3 --> 3171.48
because uh the thing is in India and

3169.98 --> 3174.0
stuff right now people have just got an

3171.48 --> 3177.72
internet which they can use no internet

3174.0 --> 3181.5
was very costly out there okay so that's

3177.72 --> 3184.4399999999996
why also the amount of movies yes so so

3181.5 --> 3186.119
the internet was not usable now only

3184.44 --> 3187.7400000000002
like in a year or two last year or two

3186.119 --> 3189.119
more internet is getting there so people

3187.74 --> 3192.24
can watch YouTube videos and everything

3189.119 --> 3194.599
so once that starts happening uh it'll

3192.24 --> 3194.5989999999997
reduce

3198.2 --> 3202.68
yeah because here that's what happened

3200.4 --> 3205.2000000000003
look the internet came people don't go

3202.68 --> 3208.9199999999996
rent movies and video uh plays no more

3205.2 --> 3211.9399999999996
like we it seems like we have switch our

3208.92 --> 3214.7400000000002
viewing habits a bit too yeah

3211.94 --> 3216.359
you know people were going to the Divine

3214.74 --> 3218.8799999999997
videos and that thing and stuff Nobody

3216.359 --> 3220.859
Does it anymore no no it's finished the

3218.88 --> 3222.3
the video stores forget about that

3220.859 --> 3224.52
they're gone

3222.3 --> 3226.2000000000003
yeah yeah so so what I'm saying is it's

3224.52 --> 3228.18
changed in the West in India took longer

3226.2 --> 3230.5789999999997
because the internet was not so

3228.18 --> 3231.96
easy to access you know there was

3230.579 --> 3233.88
charging more mobile phone companies

3231.96 --> 3236.64
were charging more money

3233.88 --> 3239.339
for like data for data how much data you

3236.64 --> 3243.66
have to use so like unlimited data

3239.339 --> 3246.54
wasn't there so like this easily yeah

3243.66 --> 3251.2799999999997
yeah so now unlimited data is coming now

3246.54 --> 3254.16
so then they can switch uh to actual

3251.28 --> 3257.0400000000004
YouTube and stuff so that's right we're

3254.16 --> 3259.6189999999997
gonna probably uh finish soon but uh

3257.04 --> 3262.079
maybe one or two more religion religion

3259.619 --> 3264.96
you have touched a bit the subjective

3262.079 --> 3268.079
with the topic we talked about God and

3264.96 --> 3270.48
divine but here you say when God Divine

3268.079 --> 3273.0
appears in flesh and blood in front of a

3270.48 --> 3276.42
person and they just run towards the

3273.0 --> 3279.359
structure that's what we said yeah that

3276.42 --> 3281.64
might not be the right uh option

3279.359 --> 3282.7799999999997
yeah I mean the structured thing I mean

3281.64 --> 3285.42
that's just their programming to go

3282.78 --> 3287.76
towards the structure you know people

3285.42 --> 3289.2000000000003
worship structures okay I mean why do

3287.76 --> 3291.3
people go to cities and stuff like you

3289.2 --> 3292.9199999999996
know like people go to uh Chicago then

3291.3 --> 3295.92
they want to see the Sears Tower or if

3292.92 --> 3297.42
they want to go to uh they wouldn't want

3295.92 --> 3300.359
to go to Manhattan people are worshiping

3297.42 --> 3302.46
big structures like people like to

3300.359 --> 3304.02
worship whatever like that's what the

3302.46 --> 3306.48
whole thing about cities is isn't it

3304.02 --> 3310.559
like the charm of cities for people is

3306.48 --> 3312.54
Big structures so so so that they had

3310.559 --> 3316.079
equated with the God and divine like is

3312.54 --> 3317.4
Big structures you know which but maybe

3316.079 --> 3319.28
God and divine might not have anything

3317.4 --> 3322.92
to do with big structures

3319.28 --> 3325.559
you know they might they have not uh

3322.92 --> 3328.2000000000003
like uh put that like

3325.559 --> 3331.1400000000003
that's why also the sports is always in

3328.2 --> 3334.14
big stages I'm like the the Arky place

3331.14 --> 3336.66
is always big Arenas with all kinds of

3334.14 --> 3338.4
lights and stuff and you know it's uh

3336.66 --> 3340.14
yeah it's an uncomfortable place

3338.4 --> 3341.579
obviously big place also by some

3340.14 --> 3343.6189999999997
concrete you go and sit on a hard

3341.579 --> 3346.02
surface you get all those lights it's

3343.619 --> 3347.819
not pleasant none of those big places

3346.02 --> 3350.4
are Pleasant for your body or your

3347.819 --> 3352.92
system or anything it's nothing Pleasant

3350.4 --> 3354.119
okay so so that's people don't

3352.92 --> 3355.619
understand that people don't understand

3354.119 --> 3359.339
the sense of pleasantness and

3355.619 --> 3360.119
unpleasantness okay so big is big is

3359.339 --> 3363.2999999999997
good

3360.119 --> 3366.0
doesn't matter if it's unpleasant

3363.3 --> 3368.2200000000003
the mind is pleased because the mind is

3366.0 --> 3372.3
distracted and wants to be distracted

3368.22 --> 3374.0989999999997
but your body your interior your Vibe is

3372.3 --> 3375.78
not please Allowed by the what's

3374.099 --> 3377.579
happening in this Direction I mean

3375.78 --> 3379.92
that's why like in U.S Open People go

3377.579 --> 3381.42
and sit in U.S open for example you know

3379.92 --> 3382.7400000000002
like it's concrete it's very big

3381.42 --> 3384.54
concrete structure and stuff like that

3382.74 --> 3387.359
and it's very hot at the time

3384.54 --> 3389.04
and you know and uh like so you have to

3387.359 --> 3391.2
sit on this concrete stuff and plastic

3389.04 --> 3392.7599999999998
chairs and you know hot weather very hot

3391.2 --> 3395.339
everything is really hot I mean it

3392.76 --> 3396.599
cannot be pleasant for you to

3395.339 --> 3399.2999999999997
um sit on those things I mean you'll

3396.599 --> 3401.88
burn like your skin out there and it's

3399.3 --> 3404.579
it's still people are sitting there and

3401.88 --> 3406.079
they actually pay money to go there I I

3404.579 --> 3408.78
mean that's very surprising because

3406.079 --> 3413.099
mostly they should ask money to go there

3408.78 --> 3415.02
because you you actually like putting

3413.099 --> 3417.119
yourself through some torture out there

3415.02 --> 3418.619
basically so they should be giving you

3417.119 --> 3420.839
money to go there actually

3418.619 --> 3423.119
but people actually pay their tickets to

3420.839 --> 3424.98
like actually go there and that's quite

3423.119 --> 3427.079
surprising you know like it's oh that's

3424.98 --> 3430.319
quite surprising sometimes the amount of

3427.079 --> 3432.3590000000004
money we pay to be distracted and to not

3430.319 --> 3435.359
face the reality of our being that's

3432.359 --> 3437.46
tragic that's what's happening your body

3435.359 --> 3439.68
actually you you you're just going there

3437.46 --> 3442.26
to torture yourself it's not even action

3439.68 --> 3445.5589999999997
yeah it you actually torturing yourself

3442.26 --> 3447.3
so I mean obviously and the players and

3445.559 --> 3449.3390000000004
stuff they are playing on hard code and

3447.3 --> 3451.5
hardcore is the worst for your body to

3449.339 --> 3453.359
run around on a hard surface you know I

3451.5 --> 3454.92
mean and there can't be anything that

3453.359 --> 3456.9
but they'll always have new operations

3454.92 --> 3460.319
and 100 operations and stuff like that

3456.9 --> 3462.42
the players and stuff and you'll just be

3460.319 --> 3464.2799999999997
sitting in the hot and getting fried out

3462.42 --> 3466.26
there and you know on the concrete hot

3464.28 --> 3467.76
concrete like in concrete gets even

3466.26 --> 3469.8590000000004
hotter you know then

3467.76 --> 3472.0200000000004
any so even these structures they don't

3469.859 --> 3473.94
make these structures in any way for

3472.02 --> 3475.02
human beings to be comfortable okay none

3473.94 --> 3477.119
of these structures are made for the

3475.02 --> 3480.059
comfort of your human body in mind they

3477.119 --> 3482.339
don't have that in like and that's what

3480.059 --> 3486.119
you say about hotels five-star hotels

3482.339 --> 3488.64
later we'll touch that topic but that's

3486.119 --> 3491.76
all I always felt weird inside the

3488.64 --> 3492.9
hotels you feel stuck you feel like I

3491.76 --> 3496.26
don't know there's something very

3492.9 --> 3498.96
unnatural very unfracto yeah yeah yeah

3496.26 --> 3500.94
yeah yeah yeah so so these these are

3498.96 --> 3504.2400000000002
things like so and so people have been

3500.94 --> 3506.52
made to worship these structures and so

3504.24 --> 3508.319
their God is the structures just like

3506.52 --> 3509.52
money is their God and the instructors

3508.319 --> 3512.2799999999997
are their God like all these things are

3509.52 --> 3514.02
their God actually so and then you see

3512.28 --> 3515.52
them coming in the hotel with their

3514.02 --> 3517.859
children and the children are all

3515.52 --> 3521.119
excited to be in a hotel like you see

3517.859 --> 3525.74
the the conditioning it's yeah

3521.119 --> 3528.96
