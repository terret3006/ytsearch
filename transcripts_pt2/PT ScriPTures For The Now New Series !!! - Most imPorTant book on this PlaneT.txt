62.46 --> 66.96000000000001
book which is called the scriptures for

64.26 --> 69.36
the now and uh that's it I've been there

66.96 --> 72.72
like herding about your book I didn't

69.36 --> 74.82
really uh seek it at first when we did

72.72 --> 76.92
those interviews but uh after a while

74.82 --> 79.19999999999999
I'm like I gotta read that stuff like I

76.92 --> 81.119
gotta read that stuff so I ask you to

79.2 --> 83.28
send me the book I received it and I was

81.119 --> 85.74
so pleased so please the moment I

83.28 --> 88.08
started for opening the the book The the

85.74 --> 90.0
first we see your pictures and they're

88.08 --> 91.74
very uh your the pictures of you all

90.0 --> 94.32
over the place and it's very inspiring

91.74 --> 97.28
and also you start reading that the

94.32 --> 100.38
basic definitions like you go into it

97.28 --> 102.24
basically and I think you what you can

100.38 --> 104.579
get what I got from that booklet after

102.24 --> 108.6
reading it writing it and everything is

104.579 --> 111.65899999999999
Clarity I'm getting more clarity yes yes

108.6 --> 115.19999999999999
that's okay so share with me a bit what

111.659 --> 117.18
was your intention behind uh writing the

115.2 --> 119.04
book and what context did you wrote it

117.18 --> 121.14
how long it took you like I want to know

119.04 --> 123.96000000000001
a bit more about the book before we

121.14 --> 126.18
start uh like the court skating it and

123.96 --> 129.72
explaining a bit what we're gonna do

126.18 --> 131.52
here with the with the booklet okay the

129.72 --> 133.56
thing is that with me that I'm not a

131.52 --> 135.54000000000002
writing kind of person okay I don't I'm

133.56 --> 137.64000000000001
not like writing another person I'm more

135.54 --> 139.379
a speaking kind of person so like if

137.64 --> 141.35999999999999
there's any topic like if I speak about

139.379 --> 144.239
it many times you know like you speak

141.36 --> 145.92000000000002
you speak you verbally speak and then um

144.239 --> 148.02
then after speaking a whole lot

145.92 --> 149.879
something becomes clear about any

148.02 --> 153.78
particular topic or any particular word

149.879 --> 155.099
or anything okay and then the writing

153.78 --> 156.72
the particular bit just takes two

155.099 --> 159.23899999999998
minutes you know

156.72 --> 161.34
so over the last 10 15 years You Know

159.239 --> 164.16
You observe that there's people around

161.34 --> 166.31900000000002
here on this plane and You observe the

164.16 --> 168.42
words terms how people they see things

166.319 --> 170.45899999999997
and all of that then you talk that out

168.42 --> 172.85999999999999
and then to actually write each

170.459 --> 174.599
something it's just like uh two minutes

172.86 --> 175.56
like each thing which I write it it

174.599 --> 178.5
doesn't take more than one and a half

175.56 --> 180.78
minute or something to type it so so so

178.5 --> 182.4
over the last 10 15 years it has just

180.78 --> 184.98
come about so this is the first part of

182.4 --> 187.92000000000002
this book okay there'll be more paths

184.98 --> 190.01899999999998
because there's much more but uh this is

187.92 --> 192.83999999999997
the first one so that where people get

190.019 --> 195.54
some basic Clarity you know so so so

192.84 --> 197.879
there are many more parts to come but uh

195.54 --> 201.42
but this is something which one can

197.879 --> 203.39999999999998
start with so like like it's yeah so I I

201.42 --> 205.79999999999998
think that's a book it could be

203.4 --> 208.5
qualified as a book for beginner the

205.8 --> 210.72
people that start to to wake up start to

208.5 --> 212.34
realize self-realization because I think

210.72 --> 214.14
it's more a self-realization you're

212.34 --> 217.26
waking up I wake up every day when I get

214.14 --> 219.35999999999999
off my bed it's a self-realization it's

217.26 --> 221.64
something you know it's the truth within

219.36 --> 223.799
yourself you bring out and these kind of

221.64 --> 226.61999999999998
scriptures that kind of book which I

223.799 --> 230.58
have here I'm going to show you

226.62 --> 235.799
and I have it here I have it written in

230.58 --> 237.06
here by hand yes yes I mean and am I you

235.799 --> 238.56
if you notice like it's very simple

237.06 --> 240.48
stuff you know like each thing I don't

238.56 --> 242.76
make many more words like every word is

240.48 --> 244.14
exact uh I don't want to use too many

242.76 --> 246.35999999999999
words it's not like paragraphs where

244.14 --> 248.27999999999997
people get lost you know this reading

246.36 --> 250.14000000000001
paragraphs and I can't I myself don't

248.28 --> 253.2
want to read any such thing which has

250.14 --> 255.23899999999998
paragraphs or anything everything has to

253.2 --> 256.26
be something which even a class five

255.239 --> 258.959
student

256.26 --> 261.12
can read and simply understand you know

258.959 --> 262.919
like it's it's not something which like

261.12 --> 265.74
with heavy words or anything with that

262.919 --> 267.9
or trying to show off something it is

265.74 --> 269.22
like in a very simple format and I don't

267.9 --> 270.65999999999997
want to follow the rules of English

269.22 --> 273.24
grammar or anything like that in it

270.66 --> 275.1
either I have a very clear thing that I

273.24 --> 277.5
want to keep the language like I want to

275.1 --> 279.36
keep it to communicate I don't want to

277.5 --> 281.58
go by that you have to have these commas

279.36 --> 284.699
and full stops and you know all of that

281.58 --> 287.52
like which is not there in it like so I

284.699 --> 289.08000000000004
have this thing about uh like using

287.52 --> 291.12
language in a way where it brings the

289.08 --> 292.85999999999996
clarity out like a lot of the thing

291.12 --> 295.44
about English language is is to actually

292.86 --> 297.3
confuse people with different words and

295.44 --> 298.44
and people use those words in turn and

297.3 --> 300.24
they get very confused because the

298.44 --> 303.36
definitions of these words and terms are

300.24 --> 305.22
wrong in their head so like it is also

303.36 --> 308.28000000000003
like a sort of a dictionary which gives

305.22 --> 309.96000000000004
you some like uh which gives you actual

308.28 --> 311.63899999999995
light on certain words what they

309.96 --> 312.85999999999996
actually mean rather than what the

311.639 --> 316.02
Oxford

312.86 --> 319.08000000000004
Webster dictionary is telling you know

316.02 --> 320.69899999999996
like it's it's and so it's in partly you

319.08 --> 323.94
attempted that as well breaking that

320.699 --> 326.34000000000003
programming of the language I didn't

323.94 --> 327.84
want to call it my Bible because I don't

326.34 --> 331.56
like the word too much I don't want to

327.84 --> 333.59999999999997
buy yeah yeah so I don't want I

331.56 --> 335.34
didn't want to call it by my Bible but

333.6 --> 337.139
it's really something and there's some

335.34 --> 339.0
stuff that that really uh like that's

337.139 --> 342.8
why this is good that's why the word

339.0 --> 342.8
scriptures work foreign

353.18 --> 358.979
like the real like there's certain uh

356.46 --> 360.9
writings and there that really res the

358.979 --> 363.12
whole book resonated with meaning I

360.9 --> 365.52
wrote it the whole thing the whole thing

363.12 --> 367.08
resonated with me and and not only with

365.52 --> 369.419
me I think it can resonate with

367.08 --> 371.94
everybody with everybody because this is

369.419 --> 374.46
truth in there this is uh like you're

371.94 --> 376.5
inside for many many years of going

374.46 --> 378.35999999999996
around this plane and noticing people

376.5 --> 380.699
like you said you went to many countries

378.36 --> 383.34000000000003
you you've seen it everywhere the same

380.699 --> 386.22
it's that you know that these are that

383.34 --> 388.08
non-desire to learn okay that yeah and

386.22 --> 390.47900000000004
there's a lot of stuff in there that I

388.08 --> 394.02
was like just the Blessed thing you know

390.479 --> 395.639
I was wondering very often I was saying

394.02 --> 397.5
no I don't want to be less I want to be

395.639 --> 399.419
more that's always what I've been saying

397.5 --> 401.759
and like it's fine it felt weird to say

399.419 --> 404.039
blessed to someone but today I have more

401.759 --> 406.56
clarity like yeah we have to be less

404.039 --> 408.68
than Divine in order for not our ego to

406.56 --> 411.9
come out and Forefront yeah

408.68 --> 413.40000000000003
because one has to be one's actual thing

411.9 --> 416.34
like one has to be very very clear about

413.4 --> 418.25899999999996
actuality not go into fantasy which I

416.34 --> 419.88
always keep on saying like people are

418.259 --> 422.46000000000004
not honest enough

419.88 --> 424.74
to realize what their actual state is

422.46 --> 426.84
and that's why there's no chance then to

424.74 --> 429.36
get above that because you are not

426.84 --> 432.29999999999995
having a clear perception of your level

429.36 --> 435.18
or your reality and then it makes it I'm

432.3 --> 436.74
absolutely impossible to actually raise

435.18 --> 438.479
yourself up from that you know because

436.74 --> 440.40000000000003
even if you're in hell you have to know

438.479 --> 441.9
you're in hell like before you get

440.4 --> 444.12
yourself out like you know like there

441.9 --> 446.039
has to be a clear perception what the

444.12 --> 447.36
situation is you know which is like if

446.039 --> 449.58
there is a situation you are in you have

447.36 --> 451.56
no this is the situation okay and then I

449.58 --> 453.0
have to get myself out of it like so you

451.56 --> 455.34
have to be very clear about this whole

453.0 --> 457.199
thing not not be in a days or and

455.34 --> 459.35999999999996
obviously the programming out here is

457.199 --> 463.08000000000004
very for beings out there to

459.36 --> 465.539
continuously uh feel more more the word

463.08 --> 467.75899999999996
more like uh then what their actual

465.539 --> 468.599
situation is so then they don't do the

467.759 --> 471.06
effort

468.599 --> 474.24
to actually do anything about their

471.06 --> 475.44
state so it's a it's it's a sort of you

474.24 --> 478.319
know like you can you can understand the

475.44 --> 481.02
cycle it's a cash 22 in that way and and

478.319 --> 484.97900000000004
all and people are taught uh wrong ways

481.02 --> 486.78
of Behaving uh feeling thinking and all

484.979 --> 487.979
of that and that is the prison I mean if

486.78 --> 490.19899999999996
there is any prison

487.979 --> 493.199
which people call the Matrix prison that

490.199 --> 495.18
is it actually yeah yeah and I I think

493.199 --> 496.68
people are busy very busy like that's

495.18 --> 499.74
what you say in the book and people are

496.68 --> 501.18
busy but busy doing nothing like you

499.74 --> 503.58
know the only thing you should be busy

501.18 --> 507.44
is doing stuff like we do like what you

503.58 --> 511.74
know I always seen what I was doing

507.44 --> 513.959
maybe not directly service to Divine in

511.74 --> 516.24
my head I wasn't saying to myself it is

513.959 --> 517.919
service to Divine but I look back at

516.24 --> 520.6800000000001
what I've done and it's our service to

517.919 --> 522.959
Divine that's what I was doing you know

520.68 --> 526.8
that by lifting My Voice by that that's

522.959 --> 529.8
what you want us to do praise and serve

526.8 --> 532.4399999999999
higher and divine but to serve I are in

529.8 --> 535.019
the vine like I've been approaching some

532.44 --> 537.0600000000001
people with the notion of ire and the

535.019 --> 539.279
notion of divine and they don't see it

537.06 --> 542.04
same like the notion of hell they don't

539.279 --> 545.16
realize they're in El me yeah I realize

542.04 --> 547.5
all this I have enough of the nonsense

545.16 --> 551.04
and that's why I'm here I have enough

547.5 --> 553.26
and process it no more yes yes but it

551.04 --> 555.66
can't stage I think yeah yeah because

553.26 --> 557.3389999999999
even the things now is like Divine and

555.66 --> 558.36
stuff are very scientific Concepts like

557.339 --> 561.12
you know like you can understand what

558.36 --> 562.8000000000001
divine is like a perfect fractal perfect

561.12 --> 564.42
golden ratio fractal and stuff like that

562.8 --> 566.8199999999999
it is not we are not living in those

564.42 --> 568.56
kind of Dark Ages where these things are

566.82 --> 571.38
just words and and they don't mean

568.56 --> 572.88
anything or which there's no clarity

571.38 --> 574.14
about these words there is clarity about

572.88 --> 576.24
these words all these things are very

574.14 --> 578.459
clear now it's not it's not a time where

576.24 --> 579.899
we we can just like throw that thing and

578.459 --> 581.279
it's not like you know just believe in

579.899 --> 583.08
something or not it's not that kind of

581.279 --> 586.38
time like right now it's it's a very

583.08 --> 589.9200000000001
very uh Clarity inducing time about

586.38 --> 591.3
these kind of uh topics or words and

589.92 --> 593.0999999999999
stuff like because people like to throw

591.3 --> 595.68
words around without really

593.1 --> 597.5400000000001
understanding them and that's where or

595.68 --> 600.4799999999999
the whole confusion happens you know

597.54 --> 602.519
like and yeah so that's that's a very

600.48 --> 604.74
important point and like you said busy

602.519 --> 605.94
means like people are trying to busy

604.74 --> 607.98
themselves so that they can't face the

605.94 --> 609.6
reality you know like if if you are

607.98 --> 611.16
actually have some time you might

609.6 --> 613.5600000000001
actually start looking at things and

611.16 --> 615.18
something might come to you and so best

613.56 --> 617.5799999999999
you have to make yourself busy so that

615.18 --> 619.68
you don't face the facts right it's like

617.58 --> 622.32
don't face reality the reality of your

619.68 --> 625.14
own being and that that's so profound

622.32 --> 627.779
that's so deep just the reality of One's

625.14 --> 629.76
Own being I think it's it's a life work

627.779 --> 631.86
it's a life work it's not something you

629.76 --> 634.019
put on Old on the Shelf say okay I'm

631.86 --> 637.08
gonna do it today and not tomorrow it's

634.019 --> 640.26
a 24 7 thing when this becomes activated

637.08 --> 642.779
PT it's powerful you create stuff you

640.26 --> 645.8389999999999
align stuff you like you do you create

642.779 --> 648.48
lightning rainbows and all kinds you can

645.839 --> 650.2790000000001
manifest yes yes yes

648.48 --> 652.62
um yeah that's why I'm in uh because I

650.279 --> 654.06
mean depends on how quickly or early you

652.62 --> 656.16
sort of uh

654.06 --> 657.3599999999999
sort of accept these facts that you are

656.16 --> 659.579
in this situation you're trapped and

657.36 --> 662.1
there's some there's a problem here like

659.579 --> 665.16
the quicker like the earlier the age you

662.1 --> 666.779
do that the more you can work on it from

665.16 --> 668.88
that point you know best thing is to do

666.779 --> 669.66
it as quickly as possible and not defer

668.88 --> 671.3389999999999
it

669.66 --> 673.14
further and farther and farther whenever

671.339 --> 675.6600000000001
you get to the point you should actually

673.14 --> 677.76
do it just there and then and then take

675.66 --> 680.16
action you have to be proactive you know

677.76 --> 681.36
like whenever you like if you're on a

680.16 --> 683.2199999999999
hell and you're in health swamp and

681.36 --> 684.42
somebody throws you a rope then you have

683.22 --> 686.94
to quickly catch on through the Rope

684.42 --> 688.9799999999999
immediately and then start going like

686.94 --> 690.48
this okay that's proactivity from your

688.98 --> 693.24
side you have to be proactive you can't

690.48 --> 695.76
just stand there stare at the Rope stare

693.24 --> 697.92
at other things you know you can't uh

695.76 --> 699.66
take time like that because human life

697.92 --> 702.66
doesn't have that much time you know

699.66 --> 705.06
like it's very short like 70 80 90 years

702.66 --> 706.74
it's nothing I mean it's it's hardly any

705.06 --> 709.079
time that there's not much time like I'm

706.74 --> 710.5790000000001
saying it's not and people don't even

709.079 --> 711.66
understand that they like they act like

710.579 --> 713.3389999999999
billionaires with time they're like

711.66 --> 715.079
they're billionaires like the way people

713.339 --> 717.1800000000001
live life it's like they have billion

715.079 --> 719.519
years to live okay this is how you live

717.18 --> 721.26
life okay 20 years I'll do gardening 20

719.519 --> 725.16
years I'll do that 20 years I'll just

721.26 --> 727.26
you know like uh like I mean it's

725.16 --> 729.48
I mean like they are not

727.26 --> 731.279
facing the fact okay your lifespan is

729.48 --> 733.32
not that long okay I mean just simple

731.279 --> 736.2
fact like that your lifespan is not 90

733.32 --> 739.0790000000001
million years on 100 000 years or 100

736.2 --> 740.4590000000001
000 years it's not that okay I mean you

739.079 --> 742.14
have to live as per your lifespan which

740.459 --> 743.8199999999999
you know what it is then you have to do

742.14 --> 745.3199999999999
things accordingly so then there is a

743.82 --> 747.899
sense of urgency in doing everything you

745.32 --> 749.6400000000001
don't have any okay like you want to do

747.899 --> 751.2
it right now because there is no time

749.64 --> 753.24
like you know it's it's it's it's

751.2 --> 754.62
nothing like people don't even face the

753.24 --> 755.82
fact about their lifespan is in this

754.62 --> 758.279
world I've noticed that they don't

755.82 --> 759.6
actually face this simple pack and I

758.279 --> 761.579
mean this this you don't it's not about

759.6 --> 763.26
Divine or God or anything like that this

761.579 --> 764.9399999999999
is a tangible thing that people don't

763.26 --> 766.68
have more than 100 120 years to live

764.94 --> 770.22
even maximum the people who live very

766.68 --> 772.38
long is 100 120 maximum I mean who is

770.22 --> 774.839
living more than that I mean so like you

772.38 --> 776.76
know what your limit of lifespan is then

774.839 --> 778.2
I mean then your time you have to know

776.76 --> 781.38
what you do with that time you know like

778.2 --> 783.48
and how to utilize that time yes exactly

781.38 --> 785.82
and that's it people live like they have

783.48 --> 788.399
a they live their life like they have a

785.82 --> 791.339
thousand years to live it's like it's

788.399 --> 793.38
like what I say all the time hello stop

791.339 --> 795.839
saying that we know hell is low we don't

793.38 --> 797.9399999999999
need to be repeated repeating it like a

795.839 --> 799.86
mantra like that's what you do and with

797.94 --> 802.6800000000001
the words we repeat them like mantras

799.86 --> 804.54
and that's why also when you see a and I

802.68 --> 806.579
like what you said about the music in

804.54 --> 808.56
the book The the music part is going to

806.579 --> 810.42
be a when we start talking about the

808.56 --> 815.16
music it's going to be very very deep

810.42 --> 818.6999999999999
yeah because I you know if we are told

815.16 --> 821.579
lies about everything so the music that

818.7 --> 824.1
we've been taught also is wrong yes yes

821.579 --> 825.66
yes yes yeah I mean that is that yeah

824.1 --> 826.8000000000001
that is my biggest thing about the whole

825.66 --> 829.4399999999999
thing is that people don't understand

826.8 --> 830.6999999999999
that the human lifespan out here on this

829.44 --> 833.339
plane is very short

830.7 --> 835.32
it's very very short it's not

833.339 --> 837.5400000000001
is not very long at all you know like

835.32 --> 839.0400000000001
it's no it's not so you don't have time

837.54 --> 841.1999999999999
to like okay like I'll have this hobby

839.04 --> 843.42
I'll do that hobby for 10 years and I'll

841.2 --> 845.279
do this and I'll just uh that thing work

843.42 --> 847.019
here I'll do this thing right Social

845.279 --> 849.24
Service for 15 years or whatever I mean

847.019 --> 850.5600000000001
people and that's not the way it works I

849.24 --> 851.94
mean the point is like first you have to

850.56 --> 853.38
take control of yourself even like

851.94 --> 855.9590000000001
people don't have any control of their

853.38 --> 857.399
body even or nothing like and no basics

855.959 --> 859.68
of any kind and then they're trying to

857.399 --> 861.18
do things out in this world which is

859.68 --> 862.68
absolutely ridiculous to try and do

861.18 --> 865.079
something when you don't even have your

862.68 --> 868.019
own self under control you know that to

865.079 --> 870.18
me is has no common sense and the common

868.019 --> 872.4590000000001
sense basic common sense is the thing

870.18 --> 874.38
which I find is missing throughout this

872.459 --> 877.1999999999999
plane like that's what I don't see when

874.38 --> 880.38
I see people anywhere I don't see basic

877.2 --> 882.48
common sense that's a main thing which

880.38 --> 884.76
is completely missing you know so yeah

882.48 --> 886.98
we're being a transformed like robots

884.76 --> 889.56
almost that's what it is when I see

886.98 --> 891.6
people first of all you see people but

889.56 --> 894.2399999999999
it's like a face without a face like

891.6 --> 895.86
there's no substance there's no like you

894.24 --> 897.24
say there's a difference also I like

895.86 --> 899.88
what you see in the book and we're gonna

897.24 --> 901.74
talk about it extensively also it's the

899.88 --> 903.6
spirit and the Soul like you say

901.74 --> 905.76
everyone probably everyone has a spirit

903.6 --> 907.5
everyone has something I'm talking it's

905.76 --> 909.12
because there's some spirit inside

907.5 --> 912.72
there's something that it's not them

909.12 --> 915.839
yeah animation yes say so that's it so

912.72 --> 919.32
uh but to get to the realm of soul and

915.839 --> 922.2600000000001
Super Soul and this requires work on

919.32 --> 925.38
yourself and this is what you also uh

922.26 --> 927.779
advise people to do here to bring back

925.38 --> 929.279
your electrical charge too yes yes yes

927.779 --> 931.019
for that phone you have to understand

929.279 --> 933.8389999999999
the whole thing like you have to face

931.019 --> 936.0600000000001
the facts okay where where you are what

933.839 --> 938.7600000000001
the lifespan is what your situation is

936.06 --> 940.8599999999999
what your level is what you need to do

938.76 --> 942.54
you have a physical body now you take

940.86 --> 944.279
control of this physical body you know

942.54 --> 945.779
like there are some basic things which

944.279 --> 948.06
have to be clear to you you know like

945.779 --> 949.5
you know and it's not like uh but the

948.06 --> 951.959
physical body is not for like jogging on

949.5 --> 954.0
hard surfaces it's not for that you know

951.959 --> 955.199
like you'll just hurt it like victims

954.0 --> 956.699
and you'll shake your organs and stuff

955.199 --> 958.38
like that a lot of people think taking

956.699 --> 961.139
care of body means like I'll go for go

958.38 --> 963.06
out for a jog you know on a hard surface

961.139 --> 964.92
you know that's that's not taking

963.06 --> 967.5
control of a physical body you know like

964.92 --> 969.959
jogging is not uh making uh taking any

967.5 --> 971.279
control of it at all of any kind because

969.959 --> 973.8
once you take control of your physical

971.279 --> 976.199
body you are actually making it do

973.8 --> 978.899
actions which keep it balanced and

976.199 --> 981.54
centered and allow your mind to be clear

978.899 --> 982.98
okay but like when you're actually

981.54 --> 985.26
joking your mind is not getting clear

982.98 --> 988.0790000000001
you you're like in a state of like

985.26 --> 990.3
you're breathing hard your brain is

988.079 --> 992.0999999999999
going in a in a strange ways you can't

990.3 --> 994.26
really that thing you know like it's

992.1 --> 996.3000000000001
like it's a temporary suspension you're

994.26 --> 997.019
putting on it but still like once you

996.3 --> 998.9399999999999
stop

997.019 --> 1000.98
you it'll be back to the same old thing

998.94 --> 1002.839
it's not going to be anything better so

1000.98 --> 1004.759
all these things you know like the very

1002.839 --> 1007.0400000000001
basics of living

1004.759 --> 1009.0790000000001
are have not been taught in this world

1007.04 --> 1010.88
at all I can I see that and that's

1009.079 --> 1012.8
that's that's a situation you know like

1010.88 --> 1014.779
and that's why this madness

1012.8 --> 1016.0999999999999
to this extent like it's you have to

1014.779 --> 1018.56
call it Madness it's like extreme

1016.1 --> 1020.6
Madness all around like what people it's

1018.56 --> 1022.88
yeah like you say it's a network of

1020.6 --> 1026.24
shared Madness it's really what it is

1022.88 --> 1028.04
and people are comfortable in there in

1026.24 --> 1029.959
their health like you know like you said

1028.04 --> 1032.48
also the comfort zone in the booklet

1029.959 --> 1036.079
that really uh gave me a lot of clarity

1032.48 --> 1038.6
like the comfort zone it's not hell hell

1036.079 --> 1040.28
is that comfortable I always say get out

1038.6 --> 1041.78
your comfort zone you're not in a

1040.28 --> 1044.6
comfort in the hell you can't be

1041.78 --> 1046.6399999999999
comfortable with pain torture and yeah

1044.6 --> 1048.079
yeah you can't be like I mean that's it

1046.64 --> 1050.2990000000002
I mean there's there's just no nothing

1048.079 --> 1052.58
like I mean people get as I mean

1050.299 --> 1053.84
everywhere is disease all over like if

1052.58 --> 1055.76
you see America even all the West

1053.84 --> 1057.799
there's so much disease and people are

1055.76 --> 1059.36
like surviving on just like uh

1057.799 --> 1061.34
Pharmaceuticals if you think the

1059.36 --> 1063.559
Pharmaceuticals out majority of the

1061.34 --> 1065.059
population will not even survive okay so

1063.559 --> 1067.3999999999999
if you're not going to survive even then

1065.059 --> 1068.72
obviously you're not doing anything like

1067.4 --> 1070.64
you're not comfortable you're not doing

1068.72 --> 1073.34
anything at all like you know basically

1070.64 --> 1074.179
like people right now are so lacking

1073.34 --> 1075.74
common sense that without

1074.179 --> 1077.96
Pharmaceuticals they won't survive even

1075.74 --> 1080.419
so you can tell the what the situation

1077.96 --> 1083.3600000000001
has level has come down to in this kind

1080.419 --> 1084.98
of lack of even existence and being you

1083.36 --> 1088.36
know like how to take care of yourself

1084.98 --> 1091.7
at all like is not known like people so

1088.36 --> 1094.1
also in the book you touch a future a

1091.7 --> 1096.32
future for me is a notion that I always

1094.1 --> 1098.1789999999999
thought hey I gotta think of my life in

1096.32 --> 1099.6789999999999
the next 10 years what I'm going to be

1098.179 --> 1101.48
in the next 10 years in the next 20

1099.679 --> 1104.48
years you know that's always the idea I

1101.48 --> 1107.9
had I never thought of afterlife yes yes

1104.48 --> 1111.559
so today I have a very different look on

1107.9 --> 1113.419
what future is also uh thanks bye thanks

1111.559 --> 1117.7
that's another word that you don't want

1113.419 --> 1121.22
to use yes yeah gratitude is a good word

1117.7 --> 1123.2
yeah the the no uh there's there's a lot

1121.22 --> 1126.14
of clarity for anybody that that look

1123.2 --> 1127.5800000000002
for clarity and also the friend part the

1126.14 --> 1130.46
friend part you know it's in the words

1127.58 --> 1132.02
it's in the words but we don't even want

1130.46 --> 1135.02
to look at the word and when if you look

1132.02 --> 1139.48
at the word friend and it says free end

1135.02 --> 1142.48
because free AC fav is free

1139.48 --> 1142.48
yeah

1144.46 --> 1151.3400000000001
yeah yeah yeah yeah your friends are

1148.16 --> 1153.38
your biggest distraction yes yes yes yes

1151.34 --> 1156.74
yes obviously yeah because uh the thing

1153.38 --> 1158.72
is that once you are not uh like leaving

1156.74 --> 1160.64
like like having control of your own

1158.72 --> 1162.679
body and that thing and you start

1160.64 --> 1164.96
um dealing with other beings then

1162.679 --> 1167.72
obviously there'll be a creation of some

1164.96 --> 1170.299
kind of a like either people will sort

1167.72 --> 1171.74
of feed off each other or people will

1170.299 --> 1174.44
sort of uh

1171.74 --> 1177.44
like let's say like I would I would call

1174.44 --> 1182.059
it that they get sort of uh using each

1177.44 --> 1184.64
other to feel somehow like that that

1182.059 --> 1186.62
things are not so bad right like yeah

1184.64 --> 1188.3600000000001
like it's okay like I'm saying but if

1186.62 --> 1190.52
you were alone and you actually face

1188.36 --> 1191.9599999999998
that reality you'll be better off

1190.52 --> 1194.059
then surrounding yourself with people

1191.96 --> 1196.58
and not facing the reality so it's like

1194.059 --> 1198.74
it's it's um you know what I always said

1196.58 --> 1201.02
PT I always said I live my life like an

1198.74 --> 1203.419
idiot I live my life really like a

1201.02 --> 1206.539
freaking idiot okay I it's that's the

1203.419 --> 1208.8200000000002
truth I'm not ashamed 10 minutes but

1206.539 --> 1210.86
this is what you say here you have to be

1208.82 --> 1212.8999999999999
a hundred percent ashamed of your

1210.86 --> 1214.9399999999998
actions that you did in the past and

1212.9 --> 1216.799
that you still keep doing in the

1214.94 --> 1217.6000000000001
nonsense that you propagate in this

1216.799 --> 1220.7
world

1217.6 --> 1224.059
and I would like you to to explain a bit

1220.7 --> 1226.039
uh because because the thing is that if

1224.059 --> 1227.4189999999999
you if you're not feeling that thing

1226.039 --> 1229.7
about that then you will not change it

1227.419 --> 1231.14
you know point is the change change is

1229.7 --> 1232.46
the important bit right okay you're

1231.14 --> 1233.96
doing something in the past now you cut

1232.46 --> 1235.76
it off and you know don't do it in the

1233.96 --> 1237.5
present or the future okay you don't do

1235.76 --> 1239.78
that okay so for that you have to feel

1237.5 --> 1241.4
some that thing okay this is not good or

1239.78 --> 1243.799
this is not that thing you have to feel

1241.4 --> 1246.3200000000002
at a strong deep level that kind of

1243.799 --> 1248.96
feeling only then

1246.32 --> 1251.1789999999999
can you change like otherwise there'll

1248.96 --> 1253.039
be no actual

1251.179 --> 1254.9
action change you know like which is

1253.039 --> 1256.82
action change to me is actions that your

1254.9 --> 1260.0
actions change you know it's not just

1256.82 --> 1261.98
like a theoretical concept for me change

1260.0 --> 1263.96
for me it changes an actual action

1261.98 --> 1265.88
change which you do with your body and

1263.96 --> 1268.82
your being it's nothing to do with just

1265.88 --> 1270.8600000000001
some theoretical mental that thing oh

1268.82 --> 1272.0
yeah yeah I've changed now like if

1270.86 --> 1273.6789999999999
people say I've changed but they do

1272.0 --> 1275.299
exactly the same things all the time and

1273.679 --> 1277.52
there is no change you know like there

1275.299 --> 1280.34
is yeah change has to be actual and real

1277.52 --> 1283.52
yeah change has to be realized to happen

1280.34 --> 1285.32
also I think it me in my case the change

1283.52 --> 1288.26
happened physically and mentally because

1285.32 --> 1290.4189999999999
I lost 100 pounds so I was overweight I

1288.26 --> 1291.86
was 300 I looked at myself in the mirror

1290.419 --> 1293.9
I said whoa there's something wrong here

1291.86 --> 1296.9599999999998
I I was saying I was handling my weight

1293.9 --> 1300.2
imagine yeah yes yes I was undering my

1296.96 --> 1302.78
way 300 pounds no I realized that it was

1300.2 --> 1304.46
complete delusion so from there I had

1302.78 --> 1306.2
the look you have to have that look on

1304.46 --> 1308.6000000000001
yourself if you can't see yourself in

1306.2 --> 1310.5800000000002
the mirror or who you truly are you're

1308.6 --> 1312.86
not you're not really yourself you're

1310.58 --> 1315.1589999999999
not free you're not the freedom freedom

1312.86 --> 1318.3799999999999
is another thing I want to bring you on

1315.159 --> 1320.659
during our talks but that's it if you

1318.38 --> 1322.5200000000002
don't see yourself for who you are yes

1320.659 --> 1323.8400000000001
yes I mean that's that's the whole thing

1322.52 --> 1325.94
you know like that's why in this book I

1323.84 --> 1327.62
try to make it like things more clear to

1325.94 --> 1329.24
people in a basic kind of way you know

1327.62 --> 1330.3799999999999
like so that so everybody can relate to

1329.24 --> 1332.179
it like you could relate to it and

1330.38 --> 1334.5200000000002
understand it and stuff like it's simple

1332.179 --> 1335.72
too it's not complicated like you know I

1334.52 --> 1337.6399999999999
have not made it complicated or anything

1335.72 --> 1339.44
but like there are various things in

1337.64 --> 1342.26
this world like various topics and

1339.44 --> 1345.44
various things which are made which are

1342.26 --> 1348.559
used to trap beings you know like

1345.44 --> 1350.0
various tripods type of things so I've

1348.559 --> 1352.52
tried to like given different different

1350.0 --> 1353.6
things for each thing you know that how

1352.52 --> 1355.22
do you get off this trap how do you get

1353.6 --> 1357.62
up that trap how do you see this trap

1355.22 --> 1360.919
how do you see that trap like so so that

1357.62 --> 1362.9599999999998
you start uh let's say like cutting off

1360.919 --> 1365.24
your chains you know like if you think

1362.96 --> 1367.82
you're uh that thing by a thousand

1365.24 --> 1369.44
chains then you have to start cutting

1367.82 --> 1372.32
one chain one by one like you know like

1369.44 --> 1374.659
you have to start breaking the chains so

1372.32 --> 1375.799
that's when you'll be free and once you

1374.659 --> 1377.48
are under those chains you're never

1375.799 --> 1380.72
going to be free of any kind like you

1377.48 --> 1383.059
know the word p-h-r-e can't be applied

1380.72 --> 1386.8600000000001
to you at all like you know like you

1383.059 --> 1386.86
know so because I mean yeah

1387.039 --> 1391.46
is

1388.94 --> 1393.38
sorry go ahead yeah carry on carry on

1391.46 --> 1395.659
yes no it's hard because the hangout

1393.38 --> 1397.1000000000001
thing is hard to do okay it's not

1395.659 --> 1399.74
because I want to cut you off and it's

1397.1 --> 1401.48
just I'm not in front of you it would be

1399.74 --> 1404.02
different a conversation in front of you

1401.48 --> 1407.2
we wouldn't but this thing yeah

1404.02 --> 1410.539
it's always it's a software I I can't

1407.2 --> 1412.7
but yeah no and that's what you say also

1410.539 --> 1415.6
you know you come back on words and the

1412.7 --> 1418.88
book very very important like honesty

1415.6 --> 1421.28
honesty you know that's what is lacking

1418.88 --> 1424.5200000000002
we're very dishonest with ourselves

1421.28 --> 1427.82
we're not looking at ourselves for who

1424.52 --> 1430.1589999999999
we really are because first of all we we

1427.82 --> 1432.74
go and we press the same button each and

1430.159 --> 1435.5800000000002
every day each and every day we live the

1432.74 --> 1438.44
same years 80 years long nothing yet

1435.58 --> 1441.799
what is that that's life that that's

1438.44 --> 1444.38
what so so we have so according to the

1441.799 --> 1446.36
collectivity the this is what life is

1444.38 --> 1448.7600000000002
for this is what as life has been

1446.36 --> 1451.52
intended for us to live in the hellish

1448.76 --> 1453.98
conditions and we should accept it you

1451.52 --> 1455.48
know so crazy I mean it's a groundhog

1453.98 --> 1457.64
day like what you're calling like that's

1455.48 --> 1459.98
on Groundhog Day you know like the same

1457.64 --> 1461.96
day yeah like repeating itself and

1459.98 --> 1464.72
people not doing anything about it and

1461.96 --> 1466.3400000000001
to not see the original situation like

1464.72 --> 1467.9
you have very minimum lifespan and that

1466.34 --> 1469.6999999999998
also your diseases and you have all

1467.9 --> 1471.679
kinds of problems and all kinds of

1469.7 --> 1474.5
tensions and all of that like which is

1471.679 --> 1476.72
not how any life is supposed to be I

1474.5 --> 1479.419
mean so like in this Multiverse big

1476.72 --> 1481.76
Multiverse it's a huge place and this is

1479.419 --> 1483.26
just a little corner of it you know and

1481.76 --> 1485.419
you know like so people have to

1483.26 --> 1486.98
understand that this is not like the way

1485.419 --> 1487.8200000000002
life was meant to be and if beings are

1486.98 --> 1489.799
here

1487.82 --> 1492.32
like and they're trapped here that's for

1489.799 --> 1495.799
a reason and that reason always has to

1492.32 --> 1499.1589999999999
be your own actions okay nobody else

1495.799 --> 1501.559
nothing like why you are here is because

1499.159 --> 1503.9
you yourself deserve to be here because

1501.559 --> 1505.6399999999999
you are not doing the things like for

1503.9 --> 1507.3200000000002
example like you know like if even

1505.64 --> 1508.3400000000001
people think it's a prison if it's a

1507.32 --> 1510.3799999999999
prison then you've been put in this

1508.34 --> 1512.0
prison because you were not fit enough

1510.38 --> 1513.98
to deal with the rest of the big

1512.0 --> 1516.74
Multiverse you're not fit enough to be

1513.98 --> 1518.96
there okay so so how to get fit enough

1516.74 --> 1522.799
to be actually part of the bigger

1518.96 --> 1525.2
Collective Multiverse is the whole point

1522.799 --> 1527.299
you know and that that's where like uh

1525.2 --> 1528.679
you don't have old age death disease and

1527.299 --> 1530.12
all of these things there are a lot of

1528.679 --> 1532.5800000000002
planes on this Multiverse which don't

1530.12 --> 1535.58
have any of that okay but to reach those

1532.58 --> 1538.3999999999999
you will require yourself to be in the

1535.58 --> 1541.8799999999999
right frame of right mentality right

1538.4 --> 1543.799
attitude right Behavior right sense to

1541.88 --> 1546.74
be there you know like and that is the

1543.799 --> 1549.3799999999999
time you have here to develop that this

1546.74 --> 1553.279
is your 70 80 90 years on ideas of that

1549.38 --> 1556.5200000000002
to do that okay that's your only work

1553.279 --> 1557.96
job here there's no other work there's

1556.52 --> 1561.44
no other job like there's nothing else

1557.96 --> 1562.76
like that is your and if people say no

1561.44 --> 1564.38
this is my that thing this is that

1562.76 --> 1566.36
person so it's not like that everyone

1564.38 --> 1568.1000000000001
has the same that thing it's not like

1566.36 --> 1569.299
this is mine or this is or we have

1568.1 --> 1570.6789999999999
different parts they have this created

1569.299 --> 1572.779
like these different parts Theory like

1570.679 --> 1575.48
everyone has a different passwords it's

1572.779 --> 1577.159
not true like you know it's it it's it's

1575.48 --> 1580.34
it's it's it's it's it's it's one only

1577.159 --> 1582.0800000000002
like there is no 100 million path to 200

1580.34 --> 1583.34
million 300 million Parts like they're

1582.08 --> 1585.1999999999998
not like that

1583.34 --> 1586.6999999999998
you know I mean there are a lot of paths

1585.2 --> 1588.559
to hell like I mean you can I mean

1586.7 --> 1591.559
somebody can just get drunk or somebody

1588.559 --> 1594.559
can just use drugs somebody can just do

1591.559 --> 1596.36
different crazinesses to be more on the

1594.559 --> 1599.539
path to that but that is different like

1596.36 --> 1601.76
but that's still One path to downwards

1599.539 --> 1603.32
okay there's one path of words there's

1601.76 --> 1605.48
one path downwards like there are

1603.32 --> 1607.6399999999999
variations of that for the downward path

1605.48 --> 1610.46
but the upward path only works in one

1607.64 --> 1612.0800000000002
way you know so so yeah like that like

1610.46 --> 1614.8600000000001
if you say in the book and most people

1612.08 --> 1617.72
are on the developing path

1614.86 --> 1620.5
acknowledge it if you can't acknowledge

1617.72 --> 1623.179
your situation your own

1620.5 --> 1626.059
being and like it's very hard to change

1623.179 --> 1628.46
anything first I think also it's uh you

1626.059 --> 1631.7
refer a lot in the book to bowing okay

1628.46 --> 1635.299
bowing and that's why we have a booty

1631.7 --> 1637.7
also you talk about the body yes and

1635.299 --> 1640.8799999999999
also what resonates with me so much and

1637.7 --> 1643.88
I keep repeating it all the time is the

1640.88 --> 1647.0590000000002
DNA on fire it's the DNA on fire you

1643.88 --> 1649.279
know this is what I think is really the

1647.059 --> 1651.02
the the thing we have to reach is to put

1649.279 --> 1653.36
that DNA on fire and you explain a

1651.02 --> 1656.299
little bit deeper maybe you can finish

1653.36 --> 1658.1589999999999
with this I will do that yes I mean uh

1656.299 --> 1659.539
it is it's good like that you have gone

1658.159 --> 1660.44
through it like because people should

1659.539 --> 1661.58
just take a little bit of time it

1660.44 --> 1663.679
doesn't take that much time to go

1661.58 --> 1665.779
through this and to go through Basics

1663.679 --> 1667.039
and to understand them and people should

1665.779 --> 1668.96
take that time and you have done that

1667.039 --> 1670.76
and that's why like you're doing this

1668.96 --> 1672.799
talk now and then it's gonna go forward

1670.76 --> 1674.72
because you have taken the time and

1672.799 --> 1676.6399999999999
actually done some actions you know

1674.72 --> 1678.679
because right now people are living in

1676.64 --> 1680.9
such a strange way that they don't do

1678.679 --> 1683.0590000000002
any action you know like they won't

1680.9 --> 1684.3200000000002
um like whenever they come across some

1683.059 --> 1686.4189999999999
information like that they will just

1684.32 --> 1689.059
pull it away because maybe it affects

1686.419 --> 1691.7
their ego or if it is uh like you know

1689.059 --> 1693.08
like yeah like it's like um do you want

1691.7 --> 1694.76
Clarity or not like it's a question like

1693.08 --> 1696.26
if you don't want Clarity then that's

1694.76 --> 1697.82
fine that's fine too like you don't want

1696.26 --> 1699.919
Clarity you want to be in a haze then

1697.82 --> 1702.08
you can be that's your choice to be in a

1699.919 --> 1704.179
haze and because there's enough crazy

1702.08 --> 1706.1589999999999
things out here in this world in YouTube

1704.179 --> 1708.0800000000002
and stuff like where people will give

1706.159 --> 1711.0200000000002
you that kind of uh haziness and you'll

1708.08 --> 1713.4189999999999
get all this hazy info and you'll all be

1711.02 --> 1715.1589999999999
in this strange kind of that thing you

1713.419 --> 1716.659
know like everything will you know like

1715.159 --> 1717.7990000000002
like a lot of people are saying you know

1716.659 --> 1719.659
like this world is going to end the

1717.799 --> 1722.48
event is coming Sun is going to explode

1719.659 --> 1723.98
and we all gonna rise you know like uh

1722.48 --> 1725.0
it was gonna happen in May then now it's

1723.98 --> 1727.4
gonna happen in June then it's gonna

1725.0 --> 1730.039
happen July like but it never happens

1727.4 --> 1732.6200000000001
you know like I mean it's it's it's it's

1730.039 --> 1734.539
like uh people who have no sense or

1732.62 --> 1736.1
common sense or anything are teaching

1734.539 --> 1738.2
people longer that's the thing that's

1736.1 --> 1741.5
what I find there are millions of

1738.2 --> 1743.3600000000001
teachers now on in this world world and

1741.5 --> 1745.94
those teachers don't have any basic

1743.36 --> 1749.36
common sense and they are teaching other

1745.94 --> 1753.0800000000002
people okay so what can be worse than

1749.36 --> 1754.82
that okay like because I mean how like

1753.08 --> 1756.1399999999999
if you can't work on yourself you have

1754.82 --> 1757.76
don't have yourself under control you're

1756.14 --> 1760.5800000000002
not worked on yourself what are you

1757.76 --> 1762.08
teaching others like I mean that and

1760.58 --> 1763.8799999999999
that's that's why this whole thing to

1762.08 --> 1765.08
urge to teach no I want to share want to

1763.88 --> 1766.7
teach a lot of people say I want to

1765.08 --> 1768.62
teach I mean you don't know anything

1766.7 --> 1770.8400000000001
what are you going to teach you know

1768.62 --> 1772.8799999999999
like I mean you have no idea of anything

1770.84 --> 1775.52
you know you don't even know what to

1772.88 --> 1776.659
feed yourself you know or what how to

1775.52 --> 1779.0
keep your body you don't know anything

1776.659 --> 1780.2600000000002
you know so I mean what are you going to

1779.0 --> 1782.6
teach out there you know like it's

1780.26 --> 1784.82
become so crazy that

1782.6 --> 1787.8799999999999
um this whole egotistical thing of I

1784.82 --> 1789.4399999999998
will teach you know when like when I

1787.88 --> 1791.419
should be learning when I should

1789.44 --> 1794.419
actually be working on myself when I

1791.419 --> 1795.919
should be you know exactly yeah and that

1794.419 --> 1797.659
and so that's what has happened all over

1795.919 --> 1799.76
and that thing you know and people have

1797.659 --> 1801.919
to realize and then when you look at the

1799.76 --> 1804.26
person who who's teaching them they

1801.919 --> 1806.659
don't look at the being actually what

1804.26 --> 1808.52
does it look like does it look crazy or

1806.659 --> 1811.0390000000002
does it you know they don't even pay

1808.52 --> 1812.84
attention to this what is a state you

1811.039 --> 1814.76
know of the being who's teaching me what

1812.84 --> 1817.4599999999998
is the situation

1814.76 --> 1820.539
like has it done anything itself you

1817.46 --> 1822.799
know they just like to hear some

1820.539 --> 1825.2
launches being spooled out and that's

1822.799 --> 1827.299
what the whole thing is right now you

1825.2 --> 1828.559
know like and they always say no no you

1827.299 --> 1830.179
are at this thing you are that thing you

1828.559 --> 1832.22
can get this you can get that they just

1830.179 --> 1834.14
give people carrots and people get

1832.22 --> 1836.179
carried away you know because there's no

1834.14 --> 1838.46
reality to it when there's no reality

1836.179 --> 1840.2
you can say anything you know like if

1838.46 --> 1841.52
you do this 10 days you'll be a God and

1840.2 --> 1842.8400000000001
if you do this you have 10 days you'll

1841.52 --> 1845.899
be a goddess like

1842.84 --> 1848.72
um it's like all this kind of uh like a

1845.899 --> 1850.279
business sort of thing and all of this

1848.72 --> 1852.44
is going on out here which has nothing

1850.279 --> 1854.779
to do with Evolution none of it like you

1852.44 --> 1857.8400000000001
know and people trying to teach without

1854.779 --> 1860.36
knowing I mean it's a very very strange

1857.84 --> 1861.86
thing you know like it's a like and now

1860.36 --> 1864.02
there are millions and millions of

1861.86 --> 1866.299
teachers I mean it's it's ridiculous I

1864.02 --> 1869.059
mean yes and I think also people seek to

1866.299 --> 1871.52
be powerful but without uh you know

1869.059 --> 1873.6789999999999
without Clarity you don't have much

1871.52 --> 1875.72
power so you use the power in the

1873.679 --> 1877.539
direction of Hell often that's what you

1875.72 --> 1879.98
do with your power

1877.539 --> 1883.22
yeah all these teachers own life suck

1879.98 --> 1885.5
like their own lives are living hell I

1883.22 --> 1887.0
mean and and then then they're trying to

1885.5 --> 1888.86
teach others you know like it's it's a

1887.0 --> 1891.14
very very strange thing you know like um

1888.86 --> 1892.399
the teacher phenomenon yeah it's a very

1891.14 --> 1893.72
strange thing yeah some of them are

1892.399 --> 1894.9799999999998
living in their grandma's basement or

1893.72 --> 1898.52
whatever and they're teaching from there

1894.98 --> 1900.44
you know like I mean it's it's it's it's

1898.52 --> 1903.559
a very strange thing you know like it's

1900.44 --> 1905.0
it's a it's a very I mean I've like this

1903.559 --> 1906.6789999999999
is the main thing you know people should

1905.0 --> 1910.039
be wanting to learn like rather than

1906.679 --> 1911.72
teach that just that itself will make a

1910.039 --> 1912.98
whole lot of change you know like there

1911.72 --> 1914.299
are too many degrees too many that

1912.98 --> 1916.1
things too many things in this world

1914.299 --> 1918.5
which make people feel so important and

1916.1 --> 1919.9399999999998
so that thing that I mean there are so

1918.5 --> 1923.0
many stages everybody's like there's so

1919.94 --> 1925.039
many conferences seminars webinars like

1923.0 --> 1926.899
uh bad things going on and everybody's

1925.039 --> 1929.12
an expert like I mean if everybody's an

1926.899 --> 1931.039
expert like what is why though there's

1929.12 --> 1933.08
no result like you know why is there

1931.039 --> 1935.36
this situation we are living in still

1933.08 --> 1939.9399999999998
like in this kind of if everybody is an

1935.36 --> 1939.9399999999998
expert like you know like so it's a yeah

1949.06 --> 1952.19
[Music]

1959.559 --> 1964.34
no that's it it was clear for me that

1962.179 --> 1966.0800000000002
you know you have to have that at that

1964.34 --> 1968.12
learning attitude and that's what I have

1966.08 --> 1970.039
I mean I don't pretend to do anything I

1968.12 --> 1973.1589999999999
always say it don't come here for me to

1970.039 --> 1975.2
feed you a a reality you have to

1973.159 --> 1977.779
discover it for yourself you have to see

1975.2 --> 1979.7
it you have to use your eyes like I can

1977.779 --> 1982.159
maybe coach you give you a kick in the

1979.7 --> 1983.96
butt or something to get you to move

1982.159 --> 1986.1200000000001
because that's what we need to be in

1983.96 --> 1988.58
action you know emotion you talk about

1986.12 --> 1991.6999999999998
emotion that was so much Clarity for me

1988.58 --> 1994.1
just that part of emotion people don't

1991.7 --> 1995.5
have real emotion when you're asleep

1994.1 --> 1998.36
when you're

1995.5 --> 2001.919
repeating the same pattern each and

1998.36 --> 2001.9189999999999
every day that's not emotion

2004.919 --> 2010.679
having real genuine emotion also bring

2008.2 --> 2013.659
you into motion

2010.679 --> 2014.98
because the whole natural thing is to

2013.659 --> 2017.44
learn like natural thing is to learn

2014.98 --> 2018.76
that is the natural thing an actual

2017.44 --> 2021.039
thing is never to teach okay like

2018.76 --> 2023.86
natural that thing is to always learn I

2021.039 --> 2026.019
mean that is the natural state of that

2023.86 --> 2028.24
thing I mean teaching and stuff is also

2026.019 --> 2029.559
like I mean like when I'm writing all

2028.24 --> 2031.179
these things and stuff like which I've

2029.559 --> 2032.5
written it's it's what happened over the

2031.179 --> 2035.26
years it's not like I try to teach you

2032.5 --> 2037.779
anything it was just my observations it

2035.26 --> 2038.919
is my observation which I'm like uh

2037.779 --> 2040.72
putting down

2038.919 --> 2043.539
so that other people can benefit from it

2040.72 --> 2045.3990000000001
okay that's it's not like a teaching

2043.539 --> 2046.899
sort of thing like uh like that where

2045.399 --> 2048.7
you are trying to teach something no

2046.899 --> 2050.44
it's not like that it is my own

2048.7 --> 2052.7799999999997
observation about the whole situation

2050.44 --> 2055.06
you know that's that's all it is you

2052.78 --> 2056.98
know so it is uh this whole teaching bug

2055.06 --> 2059.2
and this whole uh Social Service work

2056.98 --> 2061.06
which I'm very against you know like you

2059.2 --> 2062.56
know like where people say I'm gonna do

2061.06 --> 2063.82
this good for this thing good for people

2062.56 --> 2065.98
good for Humanity I mean you can't do

2063.82 --> 2068.32
good for yourself forget about

2065.98 --> 2069.82
anybody else you know like it's it's a

2068.32 --> 2072.639
ridiculous thought in the first place

2069.82 --> 2074.32
you know like yeah no and then like you

2072.639 --> 2076.3
said you don't try to teach also it's

2074.32 --> 2079.06
true because many of times we had many

2076.3 --> 2082.3
Hangouts together and many of time I

2079.06 --> 2083.7999999999997
I re I re I remember expressing myself a

2082.3 --> 2085.599
certain win you could have been like hey

2083.8 --> 2087.28
Yannick that's not like that that you

2085.599 --> 2089.5
know you should think like you could

2087.28 --> 2090.94
have taught me some stuff and no you

2089.5 --> 2092.98
wanted me to learn you wanted me to

2090.94 --> 2095.26
experience and learn and probably let

2092.98 --> 2097.119
one point seek this and you know read it

2095.26 --> 2099.4
and you know you have to take the action

2097.119 --> 2101.08
like I can have a hangout with you to

2099.4 --> 2103.7200000000003
sit and you can tell me all kinds of

2101.08 --> 2105.46
stuff but I actually have to do the

2103.72 --> 2108.22
action and do they actually really

2105.46 --> 2109.96
repeat the stuff it's with the verbal

2108.22 --> 2112.1189999999997
repetition that's what you say is very

2109.96 --> 2115.0
very important and this is where it

2112.119 --> 2117.04
starts to change the vibe yes and uh

2115.0 --> 2119.14
yeah on that note we can yeah like we'll

2117.04 --> 2121.06
in the next handouts we can take it

2119.14 --> 2123.46
further and uh you know and I just

2121.06 --> 2125.5
wanted to inform people that yeah like

2123.46 --> 2127.2400000000002
