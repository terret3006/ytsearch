5.18 --> 10.08
how are you I'm fine how how is

8.82 --> 13.139
everything in Canada like it's getting

10.08 --> 15.299
colder yeah it's getting a little cold

13.139 --> 18.18
early like the temperature has dropped a

15.299 --> 19.98
bit it's better for the laptops and all

18.18 --> 22.74
the equipment too because it's been a

19.98 --> 25.740000000000002
very hot summer honestly yeah I don't

22.74 --> 28.858999999999998
recall in my lifetime having that much

25.74 --> 32.339999999999996
eat it was a wonderful summer me I love

28.859 --> 33.6
the heat I left I left it in the heat I

32.34 --> 36.84
think I think that's good I mean human

33.6 --> 39.0
body temperature is 37 degrees so but

36.84 --> 40.68000000000001
degree Celsius in Celsius so like

39.0 --> 42.66
anything which is closer to that is

40.68 --> 45.66
better for the human body than anything

42.66 --> 48.059
lesser than that so so I don't think

45.66 --> 51.3
we're really meant to live in the North

48.059 --> 52.98
maybe the body adaptive for sure but I I

51.3 --> 54.059
prefer hot temperatures obviously

52.98 --> 55.14
obviously you're not meant to I mean

54.059 --> 57.419999999999995
obviously that's why you have to put all

55.14 --> 58.86
the skins on you and stuff to not uh

57.42 --> 60.36
freeze I mean you can't just be the

58.86 --> 64.019
human skin live there

60.36 --> 65.82
you know that's it yeah yeah so no so uh

64.019 --> 68.22
it's been great it's been great summer

65.82 --> 71.1
and now we're gonna dive deep into the

68.22 --> 72.9
scriptures the scriptures for the now

71.1 --> 75.72
the book we we have done the first

72.9 --> 77.76
eighth rule we knew we were going to do

75.72 --> 80.7
the the thing but you've been traveling

77.76 --> 82.5
a bit so that's why it's been uh took a

80.7 --> 85.14
like a month or two before we come back

82.5 --> 87.18
but it's Timeless stuff I'm not stressed

85.14 --> 91.14
out with this I'm too blessed to be

87.18 --> 92.759
stressed yes that's it so let's start at

91.14 --> 96.14
the beginning okay at the beginning you

92.759 --> 102.119
go with the with the a e

96.14 --> 104.88
o e m okay whatever and I get a e i o u

102.119 --> 108.06
m okay the symbol of creation the real

104.88 --> 110.64
home revealed okay and I have a lot of

108.06 --> 114.24000000000001
questions for that because it seems very

110.64 --> 117.0
simple to say uh

114.24 --> 118.979
you

117.0 --> 120.6
something like that I don't know if I do

118.979 --> 121.7
it good I have to practice more maybe

120.6 --> 124.19999999999999
yeah

121.7 --> 125.57900000000001
I mean I I just think people should just

124.2 --> 127.259
do us first

125.579 --> 130.2
okay rather than doing the whole sound

127.259 --> 132.12
you can't do that thing you just do ah

130.2 --> 134.94
sound first that is good enough because

132.12 --> 137.459
people's Jaws are not very uh properly

134.94 --> 139.92
that thing working and so just an R

137.459 --> 142.02
sound with their head up and neck back

139.92 --> 143.22
is a good enough start for people they

142.02 --> 144.9
don't need to do the whole sound because

143.22 --> 146.52
I mean that's the sound of creation as a

144.9 --> 149.459
whole and it's not like in English it's

146.52 --> 151.70000000000002
written like AE I owe you but uh in

149.459 --> 154.739
actually it's uh

151.7 --> 156.35999999999999
like so it's a lot more than

154.739 --> 158.22
but if you will write it in English

156.36 --> 158.94000000000003
language that's the way you can write it

158.22 --> 161.34
like

158.94 --> 163.379
okay because that's my question okay if

161.34 --> 165.42000000000002
we say that this is the symbol of

163.379 --> 168.72
creation but we're talking about English

165.42 --> 171.42
and there's language older than English

168.72 --> 173.94
so what was it in Sanskrit like what

171.42 --> 176.7
what was the symbol of creation like in

173.94 --> 178.98
Sanskrit I know this is translated does

176.7 --> 182.33999999999997
it sound the same is it the same sound

178.98 --> 184.76
just not the same letters vowels in

182.34 --> 184.76
English language

185.12 --> 190.44
in the English language but they've come

187.68 --> 193.56
from a root like Sanskrit language where

190.44 --> 197.76
the vowels are more so the sound is uh

193.56 --> 202.14000000000001
and then R then e and then e then O then

197.76 --> 204.599
O then a Then I then O then o so they

202.14 --> 206.45899999999997
are all these more sounds so in English

204.599 --> 210.61999999999998
they were simplified

206.459 --> 213.54
into a e i o u okay so

210.62 --> 215.58
this is a simplified version so Sanskrit

213.54 --> 218.879
is like a Unix

215.58 --> 220.08
of languages you know and English is

218.879 --> 223.2
like an operating system which is

220.08 --> 226.62
working on top of top of that Unix

223.2 --> 229.61999999999998
system of Sanskrit so so Sanskrit is the

226.62 --> 231.959
core root language of any language on

229.62 --> 234.299
Earth I think so yeah I've been the king

231.959 --> 237.0
of the Sanskrit dictionary because I've

234.299 --> 239.34
been doing diving deep into this stuff

237.0 --> 240.9
and I wanted to know I'm like okay that

239.34 --> 242.94
is English but what is in another

240.9 --> 244.86
language or French that good for French

242.94 --> 247.76
that's good for all the the the the

244.86 --> 251.459
language that use uh that kind of letter

247.76 --> 253.56
yes yeah so the vowels will be saved

251.459 --> 256.5
will be awesome no matter what language

253.56 --> 258.9
it is like or the vowels will be same

256.5 --> 260.76
throughout but whether they'll use them

258.9 --> 262.32
fully or not fully that's the thing but

260.76 --> 264.479
all languages will have the same vowels

262.32 --> 266.759
like no matter which language on Earth

264.479 --> 269.0
you know and that's very interesting

266.759 --> 273.18
when we talk about the vowel because

269.0 --> 275.4
these letters are in every words I don't

273.18 --> 277.86
think you can make it that's why you say

275.4 --> 281.28
also every vowel is part of the play

277.86 --> 283.8
that was a river just that page for me

281.28 --> 287.15999999999997
there was a revelation because I never

283.8 --> 290.40000000000003
really thought about the vowel they are

287.16 --> 293.16
in every word I don't think I can make a

290.4 --> 296.15999999999997
words without a vowel yeah but even like

293.16 --> 297.78000000000003
in uh Celtic like in um like Welsh

296.16 --> 301.56
weight less vowels are used in there are

297.78 --> 303.65999999999997
some words like confront xcw m f r d

301.56 --> 305.82
like but in speaking they still use even

303.66 --> 307.86
if they're not used in writing they're

305.82 --> 311.34
still used when you speak a word you'll

307.86 --> 313.5
have to have some uh come or some sound

311.34 --> 316.61999999999995
come like even in languages where less

313.5 --> 318.419
of them are used but like they still

316.62 --> 320.34000000000003
are being used in every language there's

318.419 --> 322.56
no other no language without these

320.34 --> 324.11999999999995
things okay and if we talk about that

322.56 --> 326.46
symbol that you have here the Trinity

324.12 --> 329.52
it's the Trinity with the there's like

326.46 --> 331.62
an arc and a DOT and another uh looks

329.52 --> 336.18
like the sun to me or something the moon

331.62 --> 339.419
or something but do you find that symbol

336.18 --> 342.36
in the stars like can you because on

339.419 --> 344.82
this thing maybe this is a symbol of

342.36 --> 347.639
creation like what is like the basics of

344.82 --> 350.15999999999997
creation okay like it's like

347.639 --> 352.62
like the dot it's like a DOT like the

350.16 --> 354.90000000000003
first Dot

352.62 --> 357.24
okay but where was the that this is my

354.9 --> 359.4
question this because now this is in the

357.24 --> 361.68
in the black background like I I was

359.4 --> 362.88
like is this in the sky like it's

361.68 --> 365.28000000000003
Darkness like you think it's something

362.88 --> 368.46
completely Darkness like you know and

365.28 --> 369.919
one a point of life

368.46 --> 372.9
okay

369.919 --> 374.58
now single point of light starts moving

372.9 --> 376.44
if you sing a point of Life Starts like

374.58 --> 379.62
moving that is the second thing you know

376.44 --> 381.96
that first curve yeah that first curve

379.62 --> 383.4
like this uh after that like the first

381.96 --> 386.4
curve is a single point start which

383.4 --> 387.78
starts like starts moving and so when it

386.4 --> 391.02
moves one time

387.78 --> 392.58
okay and then it starts moving three

391.02 --> 395.21999999999997
times

392.58 --> 398.46
so it's basically the number is one two

395.22 --> 401.94000000000005
three come into being number one

398.46 --> 403.5
number two and number three okay and

401.94 --> 404.639
then after that all the other numbers

403.5 --> 406.319
follow

404.639 --> 408.78000000000003
okay from one to three you can make all

406.319 --> 410.88
the numbers like okay like you add one

408.78 --> 412.85999999999996
more to that thing that's four five six

410.88 --> 415.319
and seven eight nine

412.86 --> 417.6
like like that you you're going in that

415.319 --> 420.72
repeat Loop of one two three basically

417.6 --> 423.72
so so this is the one two three and like

420.72 --> 426.0
then there is a like a sound which is

423.72 --> 428.22
associated so that language can

426.0 --> 430.259
basically create like you know like when

428.22 --> 433.08000000000004
they say word

430.259 --> 435.6
made the world and God was word and

433.08 --> 437.24
there was only the word like so that is

435.6 --> 442.259
the sound which is just like frequency

437.24 --> 444.72
okay which in this uh physical plane we

442.259 --> 448.5
are in with this mouth

444.72 --> 451.08000000000004
we can put it closest in this terms with

448.5 --> 453.539
the mouth we have with the that thing

451.08 --> 457.56
existence we have with the body we have

453.539 --> 460.5
so definitely the words are something

457.56 --> 464.52
because if I look at the just the word

460.5 --> 467.099
word and world you just add a l in there

464.52 --> 469.979
so definitely to me it's an it's an

467.099 --> 472.259
insulation yeah and L is a turning you

469.979 --> 474.71999999999997
know you're turning you're just like a

472.259 --> 478.259
loop like that is an L okay like because

474.72 --> 481.319
word in the word the W is a wave you

478.259 --> 484.68
know it's like a wave your way and then

481.319 --> 487.86
O is a circle okay and R is a rotation

484.68 --> 489.72
are you rotating okay D is like a cup

487.86 --> 494.22
okay

489.72 --> 498.72
so waves circling and rotating in a cup

494.22 --> 499.74
that's all word means actually the word

498.72 --> 502.86
word

499.74 --> 505.979
yeah and it's interesting because if the

502.86 --> 509.099
m is in the symbol of creation why in

505.979 --> 512.76
the world in the word world we have the

509.099 --> 515.52
W which is the m but upside down because

512.76 --> 519.18
m is uh in creation of because m is

515.52 --> 521.279
matter you know like the word Ma

519.18 --> 526.88
which is ma ma

521.279 --> 526.88
which is Mama which is Mom which is

528.14 --> 532.1999999999999
maternal which is matter which becomes

531.3 --> 536.8199999999999
matter

532.2 --> 539.0400000000001
which is physical matter existence this

536.82 --> 540.839
thing is all m

539.04 --> 544.4399999999999
no matter what language you see it in

540.839 --> 548.519
the word for ma mama mom everything will

544.44 --> 550.08
be that M only okay no matter what the

548.519 --> 553.14
language okay

550.08 --> 555.5400000000001
so so then that becomes matter so the

553.14 --> 558.12
matter is Created from light

555.54 --> 559.62
so in that progression the aeiu

558.12 --> 560.82
progression and finally bleach the

559.62 --> 565.14
matter

560.82 --> 568.08
from uh basic opening you get to the

565.14 --> 571.26
matter point so is that why we have

568.08 --> 573.2
water also water written with the w you

571.26 --> 577.04
know that out of the water

573.2 --> 577.0400000000001
that's a form of matter only

577.5 --> 581.399
okay matter only like you can feel water

580.2 --> 585.12
you can

581.399 --> 589.38
like yeah so yeah so that's where like

585.12 --> 594.66
you know this the c m e r

589.38 --> 597.6
oh Emmy armer like that is Emily yeah

594.66 --> 599.9399999999999
yeah yeah I see it yeah yeah and when

597.6 --> 603.24
you talk about like the dark moves to

599.94 --> 606.0
create an arc golden mean spiral now we

603.24 --> 608.58
heard about that golden mean spiral and

606.0 --> 611.6
the one becomes too static and kinetic

608.58 --> 615.1800000000001
shiv and

611.6 --> 618.36
three arcs are created with the dot in

615.18 --> 620.779
the center Trinity is established versus

618.36 --> 620.779
born

622.94 --> 631.2600000000001
yes yes yes Multiverse because uh see

627.42 --> 633.8389999999999
unit universe is Unity One only okay

631.26 --> 635.399
when you go past one even if you go to

633.839 --> 637.8000000000001
two then it's multiple

635.399 --> 639.839
okay when you go to three you're gone

637.8 --> 641.8199999999999
multi only like you're not

639.839 --> 645.6600000000001
you've gone past the unit Unity is just

641.82 --> 648.24
the DOT okay uni means single words

645.66 --> 650.64
Universe single words but there's a lot

648.24 --> 652.98
of verses here like a lot of different

650.64 --> 655.74
frequencies a lot of bandwidths a lot of

652.98 --> 657.779
things a lot of that thing so a lot of

655.74 --> 660.0
planes of existence you know a lot of

657.779 --> 661.86
Realms and planes of existence so each

660.0 --> 664.56
plane can be considered each one worse

661.86 --> 666.839
then then two there are many so when

664.56 --> 669.18
it's mining then I call it multi rather

666.839 --> 671.5790000000001
than calling it uni I mean there is

669.18 --> 673.079
unifying principle

671.579 --> 676.56
to it all

673.079 --> 680.3389999999999
but it's still multi to me yeah yeah

676.56 --> 682.26
because also if you look just at their

680.339 --> 684.0600000000001
I don't think they're really holy

682.26 --> 688.079
scriptures to me this is only scriptures

684.06 --> 691.68
but if you look at the Bible Bible it's

688.079 --> 694.14
for the name Bible you have the the mini

691.68 --> 697.3389999999999
verse and they're like that's what they

694.14 --> 700.079
say it's verse like a verse

697.339 --> 702.72
yeah so worse will be many so like this

700.079 --> 705.5999999999999
Multiverse like that thing even being

702.72 --> 707.399
Expressions beings are like even if they

705.6 --> 709.4590000000001
are doing something or that thing then

707.399 --> 712.56
they're doing it in different verses

709.459 --> 714.66
even the same thing people say it will

712.56 --> 716.579
be said in different ways

714.66 --> 718.56
like if so that will be all different

716.579 --> 722.0999999999999
verses so to me that is the dead thing

718.56 --> 724.92
and that is the multi then there and

722.1 --> 727.019
once you go past one for me

724.92 --> 729.42
multi has started like you know for me

727.019 --> 732.18
it is that's what I'm trying to say here

729.42 --> 734.519
yeah okay I get a bit more clarity on

732.18 --> 736.68
this that's good now the name the name

734.519 --> 738.6
we're gonna go with the another thing is

736.68 --> 741.2399999999999
the the next one you talk about is the

738.6 --> 744.1800000000001
name wet in the name not much

741.24 --> 746.5790000000001
considering the number of Jones David's

744.18 --> 749.0999999999999
there are in this world it is just an

746.579 --> 752.04
identity tag which you unfortunately

749.1 --> 755.519
have to share with many others but if

752.04 --> 758.519
one looks deeper a name might turn out

755.519 --> 760.8
to be more than that it might reveals

758.519 --> 761.64
one's function within the bigger scheme

760.8 --> 765.4399999999999
of things

761.64 --> 768.12
yes no I am not talking about numerology

765.44 --> 771.12
even though that is also a good starting

768.12 --> 774.0
point to discover the workings of

771.12 --> 776.4590000000001
multiversal functionings for example

774.0 --> 778.68
going into the basics of yours truly's

776.459 --> 781.079
name we discover now I want you to

778.68 --> 783.4799999999999
explain it because your name is very

781.079 --> 785.3389999999999
very interesting is it you're the name

783.48 --> 788.9590000000001
that your parents gave you passion

785.339 --> 790.5790000000001
privity yes let's see

788.959 --> 794.7199999999999
family

790.579 --> 798.66
surname okay yeah is my family's surname

794.72 --> 801.5400000000001
was the name which was given okay so and

798.66 --> 803.8199999999999
I have not changed it okay hold on just

801.54 --> 805.98
before because someone gave you that

803.82 --> 810.4200000000001
name it's your parents was your parents

805.98 --> 812.4590000000001
like very into a truth and uh I don't

810.42 --> 813.899
know if I should call it spirituality no

812.459 --> 816.0
I don't know if you're comfortable with

813.899 --> 818.579
that name it's spirituality and stuff

816.0 --> 820.92
where your parents like very aware they

818.579 --> 822.779
didn't uh give it any second thought or

820.92 --> 826.26
they didn't plan it to give that name

822.779 --> 828.06
like that like okay it just happened

826.26 --> 830.3389999999999
that they gave that name because with me

828.06 --> 833.5189999999999
like if I've taken birth here on Earth

830.339 --> 835.5
okay things will already be in place you

833.519 --> 837.9590000000001
know like that this will come to them

835.5 --> 840.18
all like they'll come to know the like

837.959 --> 843.06
the the fractal will always be there

840.18 --> 845.3389999999999
automatically you know so see since

843.06 --> 847.3199999999999
since I'm not taking birth here you know

845.339 --> 849.0
like a cycle of like when I'm just stuck

847.32 --> 850.8000000000001
here like and I'm just taking births and

849.0 --> 852.839
Cycles yes I'm just coming here like

850.8 --> 853.92
like one time like

852.839 --> 856.32
so

853.92 --> 857.88
so for me like the parents and stuff and

856.32 --> 860.82
the family I'm born in

857.88 --> 863.9399999999999
has been chosen like you know it's not

860.82 --> 865.62
random chance or occurrence that I'm

863.94 --> 868.019
born in that specific family in that

865.62 --> 870.24
specific country in that specific place

868.019 --> 872.76
or in that specific that thing that is

870.24 --> 875.76
all uh like a thing which is already

872.76 --> 877.74
been planted not it's not an unplanned

875.76 --> 879.899
thing here

877.74 --> 881.88
yeah I think that too I think probably

879.899 --> 885.24
before we

881.88 --> 887.9399999999999
come into conception we probably can the

885.24 --> 889.8
the soul or there like I cannot recall

887.94 --> 892.44
having chosen my mother and my father

889.8 --> 895.26
but probably we we choose where we're

892.44 --> 896.7600000000001
gonna end up like I did this make sense

895.26 --> 898.4399999999999
yeah I mean the things not everybody

896.76 --> 900.18
gets to choose finally the thing is that

898.44 --> 902.519
who most people what it is is that

900.18 --> 904.4399999999999
Whatever frequency they are at

902.519 --> 907.019
okay they are automatically thirsted

904.44 --> 908.5790000000001
into that frequency whatever fits that

907.019 --> 911.3
frequency the closest

908.579 --> 914.459
okay so they just thrusted into that

911.3 --> 916.3199999999999
like when in the case of like where I am

914.459 --> 918.5999999999999
deliberately taking a birth on Earth or

916.32 --> 921.6
something like that then I have a choice

918.6 --> 923.279
to go through the whole of it and choose

921.6 --> 924.9590000000001
whatever gene pool whatever that thing

923.279 --> 926.3389999999999
whatever family or whatever that thing

924.959 --> 929.2199999999999
particular thing I'm going to be born

926.339 --> 931.139
into okay so for me it's a it's an

929.22 --> 933.9590000000001
absolute Choice sort of thing like you

931.139 --> 935.94
know so so so those people are certain

933.959 --> 938.3599999999999
people like like a family which is being

935.94 --> 941.399
like a vegetarian for thousands of years

938.36 --> 944.1
okay okay there there has to be a lot of

941.399 --> 946.459
conditions which have to be made for me

944.1 --> 950.1
to be born okay

946.459 --> 951.779
and then lightning also because a big

950.1 --> 956.48
family now I'm sure you can find many

951.779 --> 956.48
names yeah so is there other

962.36 --> 966.36
like other people can take that surname

965.04 --> 968.04
like okay like a lot of people have

966.36 --> 969.3000000000001
taken into the surname now but that

968.04 --> 971.8199999999999
doesn't mean that they have the

969.3 --> 973.8199999999999
knowledge of the three ways ways are

971.82 --> 978.4200000000001
systems of knowledge you know like Sonic

973.82 --> 979.98
codes systems of like just like ayom is

978.42 --> 982.26
a starting sound then after that more

979.98 --> 986.279
sounds come and then more sounds make

982.26 --> 989.279
this world or other worlds too so

986.279 --> 990.779
so knowledge of those systems of sounds

989.279 --> 993.36
you're supposed to have the knowledge of

990.779 --> 995.699
the three main systems that both means

993.36 --> 997.32
to be vedi that's what it means but

995.699 --> 998.7589999999999
doesn't mean that anybody holding that

997.32 --> 999.72
certain in like a lot of families are

998.759 --> 1001.16
taking this I mean that doesn't mean

999.72 --> 1003.0790000000001
that they have any knowledge a lot of

1001.16 --> 1005.42
those families can actually be not

1003.079 --> 1006.8
living in a proper fashion you know not

1005.42 --> 1010.0999999999999
doing the basics

1006.8 --> 1011.3599999999999
at all so so so that doesn't mean

1010.1 --> 1013.759
anything a lot of times it doesn't mean

1011.36 --> 1018.44
anything because you're not doing

1013.759 --> 1021.139
what that is so so are you the like are

1018.44 --> 1024.079
you the first one of your uh family to

1021.139 --> 1026.24
really like search uh not research maybe

1024.079 --> 1027.86
it's more a research of yourself bring

1026.24 --> 1031.04
it out like properly like you know like

1027.86 --> 1034.1
so even in my family people uh were uh

1031.04 --> 1036.819
like actually think sort of two to some

1034.1 --> 1039.559
things you know like vegetarianism or or

1036.819 --> 1042.86
not drinking alcohol or these kind of

1039.559 --> 1045.439
things or or having some basic

1042.86 --> 1047.9589999999998
or like learning Sanskrit or

1045.439 --> 1049.88
having those so those things were there

1047.959 --> 1051.2
in the family like so those things I

1049.88 --> 1054.919
mean have to be there in the ancestors

1051.2 --> 1056.9
and not to misuse that position

1054.919 --> 1058.64
off you know like when you have a

1056.9 --> 1060.3200000000002
position like because these are called

1058.64 --> 1063.5
brahmins like that's the highest threat

1060.32 --> 1065.12
of society in within The Vedic thing so

1063.5 --> 1066.26
like not to misuse that position not

1065.12 --> 1068.7199999999998
being an

1066.26 --> 1071.02
um not to turn things upside down and

1068.72 --> 1073.82
not to turn that into like commercial

1071.02 --> 1077.62
profit or how to turn these things into

1073.82 --> 1080.84
you know there are a lot of yeah yeah

1077.62 --> 1083.7199999999998
but I find it interesting to to go back

1080.84 --> 1086.299
to the to that beginning of PT because

1083.72 --> 1088.58
come on you've been having a a childhood

1086.299 --> 1091.039
you've been having a like a teenager for

1088.58 --> 1092.72
years and then like you've grown like I

1091.039 --> 1094.7
mean I I think I I couldn't have told

1092.72 --> 1097.46
any of the family you were a baby once

1094.7 --> 1100.22
yes I was a baby once and uh yeah and I

1097.46 --> 1102.2
I chose the family like if I look on

1100.22 --> 1103.7
Earth all the things I mean they even if

1102.2 --> 1105.799
I look right now I couldn't have chosen

1103.7 --> 1108.2
anybody any other family owner like I

1105.799 --> 1109.34
couldn't have this was only like you

1108.2 --> 1112.039
know there are not many options right

1109.34 --> 1113.539
now like Earth the options are very

1112.039 --> 1115.64
limited where you can take birth

1113.539 --> 1118.1
actually where you can have a proper

1115.64 --> 1120.3200000000002
bringing or better upbringing or so so

1118.1 --> 1123.02
it is very less

1120.32 --> 1124.76
um like thing like like I find that

1123.02 --> 1127.1
India's only country where you can be

1124.76 --> 1130.52
have that like a childhood and stuff

1127.1 --> 1131.7199999999998
properly and um even in India then there

1130.52 --> 1133.76
are particular North like there's

1131.72 --> 1135.08
particular parts and that tune that

1133.76 --> 1135.98
particular family is only you can be

1135.08 --> 1139.76
born into

1135.98 --> 1142.58
the choice is very limited and I I think

1139.76 --> 1144.919
was in the best possible

1142.58 --> 1147.9189999999999
thing possible on this earth like it

1144.919 --> 1150.5590000000002
that let's put it like that yeah because

1147.919 --> 1153.88
also you're born in India yeah so winds

1150.559 --> 1153.8799999999999
yeah it's very uh

1156.7 --> 1161.6000000000001
as soon as I think about things yes the

1159.38 --> 1163.7600000000002
the woman with the Red Dot and the

1161.6 --> 1166.6999999999998
forehead because that's what we see here

1163.76 --> 1169.58
but that to me that is a sign of wisdom

1166.7 --> 1173.0
is a sign of like a third eye so I see

1169.58 --> 1176.24
people in India from here in Canada at a

1173.0 --> 1178.46
very spiritual like closer to alignment

1176.24 --> 1179.96
than for sure people in America yeah

1178.46 --> 1181.22
yeah and the thing is India the first

1179.96 --> 1183.52
thing which comes out from India is

1181.22 --> 1186.44
actually is vegetarianism okay the whole

1183.52 --> 1188.84
concept of vegetarian only comes from

1186.44 --> 1191.179
India okay so India was mostly

1188.84 --> 1193.82
vegetarian like even 50 years ago or

1191.179 --> 1195.679
like 100 years ago mostly vegetarian so

1193.82 --> 1198.08
that whole concept

1195.679 --> 1201.5
of agriculture

1198.08 --> 1204.32
is primarily like a Indian concept like

1201.5 --> 1207.08
you know like where you uh are having

1204.32 --> 1208.7
that so that is the main uh like a basic

1207.08 --> 1210.08
thing of the civilization so there was a

1208.7 --> 1212.78
civilization so there's a civilization

1210.08 --> 1214.8799999999999
in civilized your civilized you know you

1212.78 --> 1216.44
are civilized you have a civil kind of

1214.88 --> 1217.8200000000002
thing so in that if you are killing

1216.44 --> 1220.76
animals and stuff that is not very

1217.82 --> 1224.4189999999999
civilized right like it's not not

1220.76 --> 1226.82
civilization okay so no no so so so so

1224.419 --> 1229.039
so it was the it is the closest then

1226.82 --> 1231.32
that's why like I mean a lot of times in

1229.039 --> 1233.24
India like growing up as a like a child

1231.32 --> 1236.72
you can have a childhood much more than

1233.24 --> 1238.7
any other country on Earth so yeah

1236.72 --> 1240.08
you're not stuck in front of the TV I'm

1238.7 --> 1242.3600000000001
sure you're probably playing with the

1240.08 --> 1244.3999999999999
cows and the Animals outside but a lot

1242.36 --> 1247.4799999999998
more you probably have a lot more

1244.4 --> 1251.0
contact with nature illness

1247.48 --> 1254.539
horrible okay horrible the the the state

1251.0 --> 1258.02
of the yeah sometimes you look at it

1254.539 --> 1260.24
yeah yes I prefer not to talk about it

1258.02 --> 1262.46
so there is a whole lot of like like

1260.24 --> 1265.28
your chances of child molestation all of

1262.46 --> 1267.14
that are much more like in the west like

1265.28 --> 1268.8799999999999
you know like okay so all those like

1267.14 --> 1271.039
like a lot of horrible things can happen

1268.88 --> 1273.14
to you like you can be traumatized your

1271.039 --> 1275.72
childhood is like a traumatizing process

1273.14 --> 1278.0
like in the west like so yeah also

1275.72 --> 1280.039
because during your childhood you're

1278.0 --> 1282.2
very much under it nose like I don't

1280.039 --> 1284.539
remember too much when I was young

1282.2 --> 1287.66
because I was like under it nose if I

1284.539 --> 1291.1589999999999
wouldn't be under under it knows uh some

1287.66 --> 1291.159
keep the hypnose all their life

1292.24 --> 1297.6200000000001
I think it's I felt like under it knows

1295.22 --> 1299.299
when I was younger yes and and the thing

1297.62 --> 1302.36
is yeah I mean like and if you're not

1299.299 --> 1304.28
that it is quite troubling like for you

1302.36 --> 1306.86
like to like see like okay so in the

1304.28 --> 1309.26
west like even if some people are not

1306.86 --> 1310.8799999999999
liking the like the food like all the

1309.26 --> 1312.799
animals or whatever cutting happening in

1310.88 --> 1314.0590000000002
one of them or whatever they are eating

1312.799 --> 1315.559
and it's like bones coming and it's

1314.059 --> 1317.36
smelling they don't have they don't want

1315.559 --> 1318.44
to have that kind of food but then

1317.36 --> 1320.24
they're stuck in that kind of thing

1318.44 --> 1324.26
where they have to face

1320.24 --> 1325.34
all that as kids like that so they are

1324.26 --> 1327.74
actually

1325.34 --> 1329.9599999999998
so it is not a very pleasant experience

1327.74 --> 1331.28
let's say like it's not pleasant too so

1329.96 --> 1333.6200000000001
a lot of things are not very pleasant

1331.28 --> 1336.44
into that thing in the west like growing

1333.62 --> 1337.9399999999998
up so so oh no there's a lot of a lot of

1336.44 --> 1340.039
things that come in condition you

1337.94 --> 1343.4
condition you to think condition you to

1340.039 --> 1344.72
act and I don't think you can like I'm

1343.4 --> 1347.179
an abuse and stuff and all that kind of

1344.72 --> 1349.52
things and stuff like that and the food

1347.179 --> 1351.3200000000002
is very awesome yes food is horrible

1349.52 --> 1352.7
that thing is there you don't have any

1351.32 --> 1354.74
that thing and then on top of that you

1352.7 --> 1356.659
have all the systems which are trying to

1354.74 --> 1358.4
condition you like so you don't have

1356.659 --> 1362.1200000000001
that kind of freedom

1358.4 --> 1364.64
of like being first in your formative

1362.12 --> 1367.2199999999998
years which

1364.64 --> 1369.5
um creates a lot of pressure like on you

1367.22 --> 1371.299
like when you have grown older by the

1369.5 --> 1373.28
like you are quite messed up by the time

1371.299 --> 1378.02
you're 17 18 and stuff like you know

1373.28 --> 1380.24
quite messed up I like that yeah

1378.02 --> 1383.299
with the politeness we say it with

1380.24 --> 1384.6200000000001
politeness yeah yeah I mean they agree

1383.299 --> 1386.6589999999999
themselves that's what they say like

1384.62 --> 1389.299
teenagers and teenage angst and then all

1386.659 --> 1392.659
of this and yeah yeah and then it's

1389.299 --> 1394.82
called like yeah yeah so next the reals

1392.659 --> 1397.159
that that one uh was very very

1394.82 --> 1399.32
significant for me like the whole book

1397.159 --> 1402.98
resonated like I said but some parts

1399.32 --> 1404.78
were like very significant and I reread

1402.98 --> 1408.5
them many times that the real Stairway

1404.78 --> 1411.2
to Heaven Bliss Enlightenment because

1408.5 --> 1413.6
I don't think we're on there just to

1411.2 --> 1415.4
experience the little left feelings

1413.6 --> 1418.52
because it's all about our emotional

1415.4 --> 1421.22
state how do I feel right now do I feel

1418.52 --> 1424.1589999999999
in am I enthusiastic doing that talk am

1421.22 --> 1426.919
I very much on fire and you know the

1424.159 --> 1429.919
emotional state will bring you to take

1426.919 --> 1433.0
action according to my emotion I will

1429.919 --> 1435.3400000000001
take the action so

1433.0 --> 1437.96
Blissful consistency

1435.34 --> 1439.9399999999998
and then consistency you know it's not

1437.96 --> 1441.98
just like in one moment it's like what

1439.94 --> 1444.559
is the consensus consistency over time

1441.98 --> 1447.26
you know the time is the thing is people

1444.559 --> 1449.4189999999999
feel one way like today but not tomorrow

1447.26 --> 1451.8799999999999
and then there's no consistency in time

1449.419 --> 1454.5800000000002
you know so it has to be consistent and

1451.88 --> 1456.8600000000001
actually working through time otherwise

1454.58 --> 1458.6589999999999
time will always find you out okay time

1456.86 --> 1461.8999999999999
is a thing which will always

1458.659 --> 1464.1200000000001
like if you have any kind of uh so you

1461.9 --> 1467.659
can have an emotion which is there today

1464.12 --> 1469.6399999999999
but it will not last 10 years or five

1467.659 --> 1472.0390000000002
years or four years or anything because

1469.64 --> 1473.539
it can't travel through that time it's

1472.039 --> 1476.72
not

1473.539 --> 1479.5
um real enough strong enough or that

1476.72 --> 1482.24
thing enough current enough to last that

1479.5 --> 1484.46
and sometimes the opposite can happen

1482.24 --> 1486.32
also the emotion can be very strong

1484.46 --> 1489.32
negatively and you stay with it all your

1486.32 --> 1490.8799999999999
life yeah yeah so but even then but that

1489.32 --> 1494.36
is hard to take all through like it

1490.88 --> 1496.64
it'll dip it has a dip you know you it's

1494.36 --> 1499.6399999999999
not the same the whole time you know

1496.64 --> 1502.4
like it takes its dips and it cannot

1499.64 --> 1503.7800000000002
last night the Bliss feeling you mean or

1502.4 --> 1505.3400000000001
any healing I'm just talking Bliss

1503.78 --> 1507.26
feeling people don't even get anyways

1505.34 --> 1510.5
because Bliss is very far from people

1507.26 --> 1512.419
okay even me even me yeah I was talking

1510.5 --> 1515.24
about like this people give you some

1512.419 --> 1517.7
degree of enjoyment maximum like that is

1515.24 --> 1519.32
because the way their lifestyle the

1517.7 --> 1522.2
basics and the way of being and whatever

1519.32 --> 1523.82
they do is that places are still an

1522.2 --> 1526.279
unreachable State that's why people go

1523.82 --> 1528.3799999999999
for drugs and stuff because that's where

1526.279 --> 1530.84
they think that they will get it

1528.38 --> 1532.5200000000002
somewhere closer to it you know that's

1530.84 --> 1533.84
that's the whole point of all the drug

1532.52 --> 1534.799
used in the west like you know there's

1533.84 --> 1537.98
so much

1534.799 --> 1539.96
drug use in the west like so it it is it

1537.98 --> 1543.02
is an uh attempt

1539.96 --> 1545.179
to get to closer to that list State like

1543.02 --> 1548.24
yeah but it isn't but drugs don't do it

1545.179 --> 1550.5800000000002
you know it's a it's just a like

1548.24 --> 1552.02
illusion all sorts of nothing you know

1550.58 --> 1553.6399999999999
so like that's why they call them

1552.02 --> 1555.32
ecstasy and stuff you know the pillars

1553.64 --> 1557.2990000000002
and stuff they like to call them you

1555.32 --> 1558.6789999999999
know ecstasy so yeah and people think

1557.299 --> 1560.84
that oh they are higher they're feeling

1558.679 --> 1563.299
good for that moment in that like hour

1560.84 --> 1564.98
or two or seven hours or ten hours but

1563.299 --> 1566.24
then when you're back with a third and

1564.98 --> 1568.82
then you go down

1566.24 --> 1569.96
even more when you started like you know

1568.82 --> 1572.48
so you're more depressed than when you

1569.96 --> 1574.3400000000001
started like so like so yeah so that's

1572.48 --> 1576.02
why people are depressed and these days

1574.34 --> 1576.9399999999998
they can't get enough of what they don't

1576.02 --> 1580.76
want

1576.94 --> 1584.179
yeah so yeah yeah so Bliss Enlightenment

1580.76 --> 1586.58
which is a great great feeling I I would

1584.179 --> 1588.26
love to bye

1586.58 --> 1590.0
I don't know if I'm close to that

1588.26 --> 1594.559
feeling it's hard to say a little bit

1590.0 --> 1596.539
I'm very uh enthusiastic very the happy

1594.559 --> 1599.059
thing I would like to let it go because

1596.539 --> 1603.14
I think we deserve to be more than happy

1599.059 --> 1605.48
here like this is also like it's a

1603.14 --> 1608.0
one-time deal this is a one-time deal

1605.48 --> 1611.48
life I'm probably never gonna come back

1608.0 --> 1614.12
in this body in this body in this body

1611.48 --> 1616.76
so you know it's it's a really to put

1614.12 --> 1618.799
all the effort necessary to get the Mac

1616.76 --> 1620.72
the higher emotional state I can get

1618.799 --> 1623.179
during the time I'm here but it's not

1620.72 --> 1625.34
hard to it's not it's not easy to reach

1623.179 --> 1627.5
yeah the point is for that one has to

1625.34 --> 1628.76
start somewhere and some like enthusiasm

1627.5 --> 1630.2
is there that's a good thing to have

1628.76 --> 1632.059
enthusiasm and then start with the

1630.2 --> 1633.98
basics because if you don't start the

1632.059 --> 1635.48
enthusiasm Basics with the enthusiasm

1633.98 --> 1636.74
then you will not be able to sustain it

1635.48 --> 1640.279
like

1636.74 --> 1642.559
I'm very Prime very pump very Enthusiast

1640.279 --> 1644.6
very on time here but yeah so that's

1642.559 --> 1647.24
that's a very important thing because uh

1644.6 --> 1649.2199999999998
most people cannot generate enthusiasm

1647.24 --> 1650.779
for basics in the primary people want to

1649.22 --> 1653.48
run to the secondary and the tertiary

1650.779 --> 1655.76
people are always running for the second

1653.48 --> 1657.679
industry they don't want to be in the

1655.76 --> 1659.059
they think oh Basics what Basics like I

1657.679 --> 1661.94
mean they think they have already done

1659.059 --> 1663.559
that at school or when they were younger

1661.94 --> 1665.0
or that thing but you have not done it

1663.559 --> 1667.22
your school has not taught you Basics

1665.0 --> 1669.02
you have not done any such thing you

1667.22 --> 1670.52
have not actually done the basics

1669.02 --> 1672.1399999999999
because school has not taught you your

1670.52 --> 1674.9
Society has not thought you your parents

1672.14 --> 1676.88
have not taught you those things okay so

1674.9 --> 1678.74
you have actually not done it ever so no

1676.88 --> 1680.96
matter what age you are even you might

1678.74 --> 1682.22
be 60 or 70 you still have to come to

1680.96 --> 1684.08
the basis because you have never done it

1682.22 --> 1685.7
in your life there's nothing you have

1684.08 --> 1688.22
done it even close to it like you know

1685.7 --> 1689.72
so there is nothing so so to skip that

1688.22 --> 1691.52
is a very nonsensical thing people

1689.72 --> 1694.039
shouldn't have that that thing wanting

1691.52 --> 1697.1
to skip that because then then without

1694.039 --> 1698.9
the foundation you cannot make take

1697.1 --> 1700.6399999999999
anything anything you make will just

1698.9 --> 1703.3400000000001
crumble but people are always trying to

1700.64 --> 1705.14
make make make you know create this

1703.34 --> 1707.72
album make music

1705.14 --> 1710.2
do this I'll do that I'll do

1707.72 --> 1712.46
this all that will be not any of any use

1710.2 --> 1714.919
for your own self

1712.46 --> 1717.799
and for others others do like not just

1714.919 --> 1719.8400000000001
for both parties involved for yourself

1717.799 --> 1721.7
and for others both if it's not of any

1719.84 --> 1724.279
proper use and it takes them in the

1721.7 --> 1726.14
wrong direction then you have the karma

1724.279 --> 1729.62
for it and the bigger you get in this

1726.14 --> 1732.0800000000002
Matrix and the the more karma comes on

1729.62 --> 1734.059
you if you are putting the people on the

1732.08 --> 1736.8799999999999
wrong direction in the wrong path you

1734.059 --> 1740.0
know so so that's why I focus a lot on

1736.88 --> 1743.1200000000001
the basic like I told you and I'm not so

1740.0 --> 1745.159
much into a like a big big knowledge

1743.12 --> 1748.3999999999999
like astrology and that maybe eventually

1745.159 --> 1749.659
I'll dive deep into Australia I'm

1748.4 --> 1751.1200000000001
talking about music even people dive

1749.659 --> 1753.3200000000002
into music

1751.12 --> 1756.02
people think music is not knowledge

1753.32 --> 1758.779
people think that is anybody can do

1756.02 --> 1760.039
music I mean so everybody jumps into it

1758.779 --> 1761.6
that's what I said like and then they

1760.039 --> 1764.24
make some music and there is a certain

1761.6 --> 1766.82
kind of vibration which affects people a

1764.24 --> 1768.799
certain way now that way the way it

1766.82 --> 1770.6589999999999
affects people that is not the way the

1768.799 --> 1772.22
people should be affected and that's not

1770.659 --> 1775.88
the way it doesn't give them any kind of

1772.22 --> 1777.919
coreans and actual knowledge of how to

1775.88 --> 1779.3600000000001
live you know and it sends them their

1777.919 --> 1781.039
own Direction all kinds of music which

1779.36 --> 1782.779
are there on Earth right now made by

1781.039 --> 1785.059
people who don't have who have confused

1782.779 --> 1786.919
themselves create confusion in other

1785.059 --> 1788.899
people okay because you're confused

1786.919 --> 1791.779
yourself and you are actually putting

1788.899 --> 1794.12
that confusion out towards the thing and

1791.779 --> 1795.799
people are and you make statements you

1794.12 --> 1797.779
can make a lot of very clear statements

1795.799 --> 1800.48
like oh I know something and you speak

1797.779 --> 1803.36
those things but they're actually really

1800.48 --> 1805.58
confuse things and you and the more like

1803.36 --> 1807.6789999999999
some people say it with more conviction

1805.58 --> 1809.6
so then more other people believe it

1807.679 --> 1811.8200000000002
just because this person is saying it

1809.6 --> 1813.4399999999998
with conviction you know but the reality

1811.82 --> 1814.9399999999998
is that that's not knowledge of any kind

1813.44 --> 1817.1000000000001
so that kind of thing is didn't sound

1814.94 --> 1819.44
music and everything not just astrology

1817.1 --> 1822.1399999999999
or for me everything is the same like

1819.44 --> 1825.799
music astrology all these things are

1822.14 --> 1828.919
tertiary things like first comes you and

1825.799 --> 1830.299
yourself and like most of the people who

1828.919 --> 1831.5590000000002
are big in music industry or anything

1830.299 --> 1833.899
they couldn't take care of their own

1831.559 --> 1836.36
body even they are smoking pot mostly or

1833.899 --> 1837.6789999999999
like drinking alcohol or taking drugs

1836.36 --> 1840.26
and things like that they are that kind

1837.679 --> 1842.1200000000001
of people you know and now they have

1840.26 --> 1843.3799999999999
become the preachers like being a

1842.12 --> 1844.82
musician is like the same as a preacher

1843.38 --> 1846.6200000000001
you're a preacher like if you are a

1844.82 --> 1848.539
musician I mean it's a simple thing like

1846.62 --> 1851.779
it's no different like you're actually

1848.539 --> 1854.0
preaching like like yeah yeah there's a

1851.779 --> 1857.659
very very different step between

1854.0 --> 1860.779
creating music from the the studio and

1857.659 --> 1864.2
and going to perform this on stage

1860.779 --> 1867.5
that's a very big difference there now

1864.2 --> 1869.8400000000001
you're an actor you're a performer on to

1867.5 --> 1872.419
the Babylonian stage the whatever stage

1869.84 --> 1874.76
it is yeah it's very different and the

1872.419 --> 1876.26
way yeah and also like then you're a

1874.76 --> 1878.6589999999999
preacher like being a musician is a

1876.26 --> 1880.64
preacher you are preaching oh yeah every

1878.659 --> 1881.96
note you play every that thing you do

1880.64 --> 1884.2990000000002
anything you are preaching it's a

1881.96 --> 1886.46
preacher job yes but to preach do you

1884.299 --> 1889.6399999999999
know what to preach like do you actually

1886.46 --> 1891.74
know anything to actually preach

1889.64 --> 1893.0590000000002
to people like you know and that's

1891.74 --> 1894.38
that's where the problem arises they

1893.059 --> 1896.48
don't know themselves for their own

1894.38 --> 1898.46
lives they have no idea what they're

1896.48 --> 1900.679
doing in their own lives but they are

1898.46 --> 1902.74
still going out and preaching to other

1900.679 --> 1905.72
people which which creates a very very

1902.74 --> 1907.22
problematic situation and if that wasn't

1905.72 --> 1909.02
there we would have less of the problems

1907.22 --> 1911.96
even not all these people always coming

1909.02 --> 1914.299
out and telling people these things and

1911.96 --> 1915.8600000000001
giving these kind of things to people we

1914.299 --> 1917.299
would have a better system where people

1915.86 --> 1919.4599999999998
will actually be receptive to something

1917.299 --> 1921.1399999999999
Basics more Basics and stuff the more of

1919.46 --> 1923.779
this music and stuff people here the

1921.14 --> 1924.6200000000001
less of Basics they want to do like gyms

1923.779 --> 1927.799
and that's

1924.62 --> 1931.2199999999998
the actual yeah but that's an

1927.799 --> 1935.36
interesting word also music because it's

1931.22 --> 1938.74
music why do we speak music it should be

1935.36 --> 1941.24
a zed if it's music because it's music

1938.74 --> 1943.7
it's sick anyway

1941.24 --> 1947.919
yeah yeah I mean because it's a muse I

1943.7 --> 1953.419
see the world news English nusd

1947.919 --> 1955.5800000000002
I see I see the Muse okay so that that's

1953.419 --> 1960.26
where it came from the word came from

1955.58 --> 1962.4189999999999
news I see okay so the Muse is the the

1960.26 --> 1964.039
and use

1962.419 --> 1966.2
a matter

1964.039 --> 1968.899
okay but why did we change the s for

1966.2 --> 1973.3400000000001
this because it's yeah but use the word

1968.899 --> 1978.9799999999998
users use us is used okay I can use what

1973.34 --> 1983.0
I am using M I am using this

1978.98 --> 1985.46
it's for yeah yeah okay I am using it's

1983.0 --> 1989.0
like a use I am using that's what news

1985.46 --> 1991.82
is yeah that's what music is okay like

1989.0 --> 1993.74
I'm using this can you use this or can I

1991.82 --> 1995.6589999999999
use this or can you use this that's all

1993.74 --> 1998.0
it is that's all I'm saying so people

1995.659 --> 2001.0590000000002
don't understand that even music is not

1998.0 --> 2003.519
a basic thing or that on the primaries

2001.059 --> 2006.46
it's also in the same level as astrology

2003.519 --> 2007.659
okay it's but um but people do anything

2006.46 --> 2009.039
like people do Australia right now

2007.659 --> 2011.019
people do music people do all these

2009.039 --> 2013.6589999999999
things which are tertiary things which

2011.019 --> 2014.919
they according to me like they are not

2013.659 --> 2018.5800000000002
on the level

2014.919 --> 2019.779
to do those things because they are not

2018.58 --> 2023.74
gonna

2019.779 --> 2026.2
actually give people any kind of proper

2023.74 --> 2028.96
reality

2026.2 --> 2031.419
okay knowledge worth knowing what

2028.96 --> 2032.919
knowing means which is applicable like

2031.419 --> 2034.48
which is knowledge is like which is

2032.919 --> 2037.1200000000001
applicable which you can apply to

2034.48 --> 2039.64
yourself which is to start with your own

2037.12 --> 2041.799
self means it's your body first okay so

2039.64 --> 2043.72
if you can't apply it to that you know

2041.799 --> 2046.12
then I mean to me it's completely

2043.72 --> 2048.52
useless you know and that kind of thing

2046.12 --> 2050.02
and it takes you in wrong directions I

2048.52 --> 2051.82
mean people listen to all kinds of music

2050.02 --> 2053.32
and it all takes them into wrong

2051.82 --> 2054.3990000000003
direction I mean people listen to it

2053.32 --> 2056.32
again that kind of thing then they'll

2054.399 --> 2058.06
start smoking pot if you listen to rock

2056.32 --> 2059.7400000000002
and roll they start drinking if people

2058.06 --> 2061.96
are listening to Transit I think they'll

2059.74 --> 2063.22
start taking ecstasy and drugs and if

2061.96 --> 2065.679
people are listening to that thing all

2063.22 --> 2067.1189999999997
of this has an actual

2065.679 --> 2070.54
effect

2067.119 --> 2071.859
okay yes so so it's it's not like that

2070.54 --> 2073.359
it doesn't affect you and people say oh

2071.859 --> 2076.119
no this is nothing I mean that's

2073.359 --> 2078.7599999999998
nonsense I mean everything affects you

2076.119 --> 2080.3790000000004
okay and it takes you in a certain

2078.76 --> 2082.3
direction okay like and that direction

2080.379 --> 2083.6189999999997
is not necessarily for your Evolution

2082.3 --> 2085.599
okay that's

2083.619 --> 2087.94
very clear because even the beings who

2085.599 --> 2089.82
are making that stuff don't care one bit

2087.94 --> 2091.839
about their own Evolution let alone

2089.82 --> 2094.4190000000003
anyone else's

2091.839 --> 2096.639
like you've been mentioning people

2094.419 --> 2099.2799999999997
smoking but that's one thing I haven't

2096.639 --> 2101.32
found in your book is cannabis and I

2099.28 --> 2104.8590000000004
would like to bring you on this fast

2101.32 --> 2107.619
just surface the sub the topic a bit but

2104.859 --> 2110.2599999999998
the Cannabis is a plant some people use

2107.619 --> 2112.78
it as medicine what's your take on

2110.26 --> 2116.5600000000004
cannabis to be used as medicine I'm not

2112.78 --> 2118.0600000000004
saying there are all kinds of plants

2116.56 --> 2121.42
there are plants which are poisonous

2118.06 --> 2123.22
also I mean if you drink anything or eat

2121.42 --> 2125.32
anything of them you'll die okay okay

2123.22 --> 2127.48
that is there are plants like that too

2125.32 --> 2129.46
just because it's a plant

2127.48 --> 2131.14
doesn't make it good but like number one

2129.46 --> 2134.56
is just just because it's a plant

2131.14 --> 2136.24
doesn't make it holy okay okay there is

2134.56 --> 2139.42
a plant which is considered a holy basil

2136.24 --> 2141.5789999999997
okay which is Tulsi which is a holy

2139.42 --> 2144.16
plant okay when white is considered

2141.579 --> 2146.38
holies because if you take its leaf it

2144.16 --> 2149.44
is balanced in all the three humors so

2146.38 --> 2151.96
so when you actually take it it turns

2149.44 --> 2154.42
your body towards balancing itself okay

2151.96 --> 2156.099
so that is called a holy plant cannabis

2154.42 --> 2159.2200000000003
is not a holy plant first number one

2156.099 --> 2161.44
okay okay but everybody consider it as

2159.22 --> 2164.02
the plant that's gonna save this plane

2161.44 --> 2167.14
and yeah yeah because it is not a holy

2164.02 --> 2171.04
plant it all it does it's a sedative

2167.14 --> 2173.6189999999997
okay in a simple terms now imagine it's

2171.04 --> 2176.8
legal here in Canada yeah it's it's a

2173.619 --> 2178.78
sedative if you have any kind of pain if

2176.8 --> 2181.3
you can have any kind of that thing it

2178.78 --> 2184.2400000000002
can reduce that it can that thing you

2181.3 --> 2186.46
you'll not feel it okay so like it's

2184.24 --> 2188.5
it's a it's a sedative and it can put

2186.46 --> 2190.42
you into a like if you are having a

2188.5 --> 2193.48
mental tension and a lot of that thing

2190.42 --> 2197.14
it'll relax you out okay because it's a

2193.48 --> 2198.28
sedative okay so it it that's its

2197.14 --> 2201.94
function that's the function of that

2198.28 --> 2203.92
plant okay but sedation you can do but

2201.94 --> 2205.7200000000003
afterwards you will come back to the

2203.92 --> 2206.92
same state once the effect wears off

2205.72 --> 2208.839
it's not like then you'll need it again

2206.92 --> 2210.4
then you'll need it again then you'll

2208.839 --> 2212.7999999999997
need it again it's like

2210.4 --> 2214.06
you'll have to be continuously so why do

2212.8 --> 2215.619
actions in the first place which are

2214.06 --> 2217.54
making you tense

2215.619 --> 2219.6400000000003
so it's not going to solve the root core

2217.54 --> 2221.98
issue

2219.64 --> 2223.72
it's just gonna give you temporary

2221.98 --> 2227.26
sedation that's all

2223.72 --> 2229.4199999999996
it's gonna do so yeah

2227.26 --> 2232.0600000000004
like I said often I smoke can I miss

2229.42 --> 2234.28
myself but I don't smoke it to get high

2232.06 --> 2236.5
or like I don't smoke we could be before

2234.28 --> 2238.9
I come and do this with you I don't talk

2236.5 --> 2241.3
I need my head I need to be here present

2238.9 --> 2244.48
so you know there's times where I use it

2241.3 --> 2248.5600000000004
mostly at night I have a huge huge throw

2244.48 --> 2251.619
Monday huge permanent freaking pain so

2248.56 --> 2253.06
sometimes it's necessary so instead

2251.619 --> 2255.94
that's exactly what I said that's what

2253.06 --> 2257.38
it does that's what I use it for yeah

2255.94 --> 2258.28
that's what it does so that's a plant

2257.38 --> 2259.839
like there are a lot of plants which

2258.28 --> 2261.76
have different characteristics some

2259.839 --> 2263.619
plants give you this some plants that

2261.76 --> 2266.0200000000004
that is that particular plant but it's

2263.619 --> 2269.1400000000003
not by any means a holy plant which

2266.02 --> 2271.54
gives you a holistic holy thing so the

2269.14 --> 2274.18
only holy plant is called holy basa okay

2271.54 --> 2277.3
okay call holy basil okay not the best

2274.18 --> 2279.339
normal basil but holy basil okay which

2277.3 --> 2282.4
is uh which is the only plant which has

2279.339 --> 2284.38
all the three humans balanced okay which

2282.4 --> 2286.1800000000003
is what is required for the human body

2284.38 --> 2288.94
to be healthy is that there are three

2286.18 --> 2291.16
humors in your body are balanced okay so

2288.94 --> 2292.66
so that is the only plant which does

2291.16 --> 2294.3999999999996
that so that is the only pan and doesn't

2292.66 --> 2296.2
give you any kind of high that plant

2294.4 --> 2297.7000000000003
doesn't give you any kind of high or

2296.2 --> 2298.839
anything it just brings you into balance

2297.7 --> 2301.72
nothing else

2298.839 --> 2303.4
okay so like I mean cannabis also is not

2301.72 --> 2305.02
a high I mean that's like people think

2303.4 --> 2306.7000000000003
that even alcohol gives people high

2305.02 --> 2308.44
people think that alcohol gives them a

2306.7 --> 2310.8999999999996
high I mean alcohol is also a sedative

2308.44 --> 2313.78
okay so that's not it can't be called a

2310.9 --> 2316.0
high like it's a low but it feels like a

2313.78 --> 2317.44
high to you but just because your brain

2316.0 --> 2319.78
has stopped functioning for a bit like

2317.44 --> 2322.7200000000003
you know that's all it is that's all it

2319.78 --> 2326.1400000000003
is because I never feel eye smoking weed

2322.72 --> 2329.859
I feel like I am Stone like a stone you

2326.14 --> 2331.7799999999997
know almost uh yeah yeah like and

2329.859 --> 2335.2
alcohol also like put you to sleep

2331.78 --> 2337.6600000000003
finally like I mean yeah yeah yeah so so

2335.2 --> 2340.0
I mean so that's that's all it is like

2337.66 --> 2342.04
these are sedatives so yeah I mean

2340.0 --> 2343.66
they're different kind of sedatives like

2342.04 --> 2345.579
one works or function the motor nerves

2343.66 --> 2347.56
and one on other things so they are

2345.579 --> 2349.96
different kind and obviously alcohol is

2347.56 --> 2352.359
even more dangerous because

2349.96 --> 2353.859
um it gives you a sense of euphoria

2352.359 --> 2355.119
first like or some sort of like that

2353.859 --> 2358.5989999999997
thing that you

2355.119 --> 2361.48
like to do anything you know here in

2358.599 --> 2364.96
Canada the alcohol is consume a very

2361.48 --> 2367.0
very intensively uh Canada new Western

2364.96 --> 2369.4
like especially here in Quebec is the

2367.0 --> 2372.339
beer everybody drink beer almost and

2369.4 --> 2374.14
cannabis now is becoming uh legal like

2372.339 --> 2376.32
we're gonna be able to buy it in a few

2374.14 --> 2381.339
days and any store all over the nation

2376.32 --> 2383.44
so how is India I'm curious about NGO

2381.339 --> 2386.02
where you're from like how are people

2383.44 --> 2387.94
with alcohol and cannabis yeah thing is

2386.02 --> 2390.22
I mean see what is called cannabis it's

2387.94 --> 2393.4
called it's a weed which was first found

2390.22 --> 2394.9599999999996
in Himalayas only okay it's a weed weed

2393.4 --> 2397.0
means like people used to like it used

2394.96 --> 2399.52
to grow automatically in between the

2397.0 --> 2401.02
crops yeah and people used to come throw

2399.52 --> 2403.24
it away

2401.02 --> 2404.74
ways to cut it and throw it away okay it

2403.24 --> 2406.9599999999996
was a weed that's why it's called weed

2404.74 --> 2408.3999999999996
the word term weed comes from the fact

2406.96 --> 2410.38
that it was actually a weed in the

2408.4 --> 2411.52
Himalayas so in the Himalayas it grows

2410.38 --> 2413.98
like

2411.52 --> 2415.66
by itself a lot of it you know it's like

2413.98 --> 2417.16
unwanted plants which grow in your

2415.66 --> 2420.52
garden

2417.16 --> 2422.5
okay so it's not a any big thing out

2420.52 --> 2425.74
there you know like I mean that way like

2422.5 --> 2427.119
like um like they can have like all the

2425.74 --> 2428.56
that thing in the world like now the

2427.119 --> 2429.82
same Himalayan meat they try to grow it

2428.56 --> 2432.04
in California and so

2429.82 --> 2433.6600000000003
you know and they have to put in these

2432.04 --> 2435.82
greenhouses and all this and this

2433.66 --> 2439.5989999999997
technology and that technology and uh

2435.82 --> 2440.8590000000004
just to try and recreate the Himalayan

2439.599 --> 2442.3
conditions but in Himalayas the

2440.859 --> 2444.04
conditions where the conditions in the

2442.3 --> 2446.92
altitude and everything is such that it

2444.04 --> 2451.079
grows naturally and automatically okay

2446.92 --> 2454.78
so so India is the birthplace of this

2451.079 --> 2457.8390000000004
planet and it's it's and that thing you

2454.78 --> 2459.2200000000003
know so so and in the last like um let's

2457.839 --> 2460.48
say a thousand two thousand years there

2459.22 --> 2462.52
have been some people who started using

2460.48 --> 2465.64
it and smoking it

2462.52 --> 2467.56
and so it became a more big thing so

2465.64 --> 2470.02
those from those people

2467.56 --> 2472.48
only the West learned about this

2470.02 --> 2474.52
the hippies came to know about

2472.48 --> 2476.7400000000002
this from those people which are called

2474.52 --> 2478.72
sadhu Babas and stuff like that in India

2476.74 --> 2479.9399999999996
so that's how it has reached the West

2478.72 --> 2483.3999999999996
even

2479.94 --> 2485.88
this this particular thing so yeah it's

2483.4 --> 2488.859
very it's socially accepted

2485.88 --> 2490.48
in in India it was a like I mean there

2488.859 --> 2493.06
was no it was never illegal or anything

2490.48 --> 2496.06
any or anything like that like you know

2493.06 --> 2498.64
so there was nothing so but I think

2496.06 --> 2500.2599999999998
there is an agenda also with making this

2498.64 --> 2502.42
substance legal they want to put

2500.26 --> 2504.579
everybody's Stone like a stone no they

2502.42 --> 2506.079
don't want people like it should be

2504.579 --> 2508.1800000000003
neither illegal or legal it's just a

2506.079 --> 2509.98
plant I mean there's nothing to do with

2508.18 --> 2514.859
legal or illegal in this exactly yeah

2509.98 --> 2514.859
yeah yeah I mean Legalize It

2515.4 --> 2520.3
yeah yeah the point is yeah the point is

2517.9 --> 2522.4
like to make it too much into a big deal

2520.3 --> 2524.7400000000002
or what it is not okay when you turn

2522.4 --> 2526.6600000000003
something into a big deal like like you

2524.74 --> 2529.18
know spirulina in the west was made into

2526.66 --> 2530.6189999999997
a big deal you know like okay just eat

2529.18 --> 2532.72
spirulina and you'll be fine you know

2530.619 --> 2533.859
like all like so it's like all these

2532.72 --> 2535.18
different things are marketed in the

2533.859 --> 2537.7
west different times as the like

2535.18 --> 2539.14
absolute saviors of everything like oh

2537.7 --> 2541.359
eat Goji berries and you don't need to

2539.14 --> 2543.22
eat anything else like you know like uh

2541.359 --> 2544.839
like uh

2543.22 --> 2546.9399999999996
laughs

2544.839 --> 2548.5
yeah could you marry

2546.94 --> 2549.88
berries have you seen them all over the

2548.5 --> 2552.579
place

2549.88 --> 2554.92
see them five years ago yeah yeah yeah

2552.579 --> 2557.079
okay I mean and these are just crazes

2554.92 --> 2558.88
and like facts which are created in the

2557.079 --> 2561.46
west because they don't have any actual

2558.88 --> 2563.32
idea of food or anything so they create

2561.46 --> 2565.42
a fad every two years or three years or

2563.32 --> 2567.88
five years some kind of fat which people

2565.42 --> 2569.44
keep on going crazy about because you

2567.88 --> 2571.42
don't have any balanced diet you don't

2569.44 --> 2574.599
have any of these things so might as

2571.42 --> 2577.0
well create these uh crazy fads all

2574.599 --> 2579.0
every through two years and five years

2577.0 --> 2581.38
and stuff like that so yeah

2579.0 --> 2583.42
this is the first thing you mentioned

2581.38 --> 2585.28
when you talk about it that's why I

2583.42 --> 2587.44
didn't mention cannabism in the book

2585.28 --> 2589.78
because I put them as like uh like in

2587.44 --> 2591.819
the terms of like drugs or like those

2589.78 --> 2593.7400000000002
kind of things you know like which now

2591.819 --> 2596.68
it's an more that thing drug which is a

2593.74 --> 2599.02
well-known drug like let's say like so

2596.68 --> 2601.2999999999997
it comes under all of those things they

2599.02 --> 2603.339
can be I mean that way heroin also comes

2601.3 --> 2607.119
from a plant only like you know and

2603.339 --> 2609.7
Poppy and stuff like so I mean like I

2607.119 --> 2611.56
mean that's like I mean I can put them

2609.7 --> 2613.0
all under the same classification of

2611.56 --> 2615.94
outside and where you're trying to get

2613.0 --> 2617.02
something from outside and just trying

2615.94 --> 2619.9
to create the state within your body

2617.02 --> 2621.7
rather than working from the inside

2619.9 --> 2622.78
with the right attitude and behavior to

2621.7 --> 2624.819
create that state

2622.78 --> 2626.8
here here there's a question I have for

2624.819 --> 2629.2599999999998
you because in the Rick let me see the

2626.8 --> 2632.079
right diet turkey avoiding violent foods

2629.26 --> 2633.94
like meat and Bliss reducing ones like

2632.079 --> 2636.88
white sugar and genetically modified

2633.94 --> 2641.56
foods but then your recommendation you

2636.88 --> 2645.04
mark veggies lentils grains nuts Roots

2641.56 --> 2646.599
herbs spices and three dots but why not

2645.04 --> 2649.599
fruit

2646.599 --> 2649.599
foreign

2655.599 --> 2662.2000000000003
of root okay okay it's acid okay okay

2659.98 --> 2663.16
especially the oranges and stuff like

2662.2 --> 2665.14
and especially in the west like even

2663.16 --> 2667.48
apple is so acidic like if someone eats

2665.14 --> 2670.18
a whole Apple like like their whole

2667.48 --> 2673.9
brain will be spinning like for a for a

2670.18 --> 2676.359
while like you know like this there's

2673.9 --> 2678.819
something you're saying here because hi

2676.359 --> 2680.38
Paul yeah something you see here all

2678.819 --> 2682.599
over the place apples are very popular

2680.38 --> 2685.119
people eat apple but also I remember

2682.599 --> 2687.099
been told that someone bit into an apple

2685.119 --> 2689.5
and there's Apple's computer and so

2687.099 --> 2691.9
Apple might not be that good for us

2689.5 --> 2693.28
maybe yeah I mean there's an apple a day

2691.9 --> 2695.319
keeps doctor away and these kind of

2693.28 --> 2697.3590000000004
terms are there you know like but apple

2695.319 --> 2698.5
is acidic food like it's very acidic

2697.359 --> 2700.18
especially in the west the one which

2698.5 --> 2702.52
grows in the west is more acidic because

2700.18 --> 2704.44
it is the sweeter the Apple the less

2702.52 --> 2708.119
acidic it is but you don't get very

2704.44 --> 2708.119
sweet apples it's foreign

2719.26 --> 2723.1600000000003
okay so that's that's the whole point

2721.48 --> 2724.42
like so you know like that's why the

2723.16 --> 2726.04
witches used to have the Apple in the

2724.42 --> 2728.56
poison and apple and blah blah blah

2726.04 --> 2730.7799999999997
stories are there and the whole thing in

2728.56 --> 2732.64
the in the in in the apple is not

2730.78 --> 2734.2000000000003
exactly a fruit but you can eat huge

2732.64 --> 2736.42
amount like a whole apple or anything

2734.2 --> 2739.319
you know like even Birds if you notice

2736.42 --> 2739.319
if they bite into apples

2739.619 --> 2745.7200000000003
yeah the birds only take a little bit

2742.599 --> 2747.3
there which bird eats a whole Apple I

2745.72 --> 2750.22
don't know of any

2747.3 --> 2752.44
even the squirrel will get onto an apple

2750.22 --> 2754.06
will only take a bite yeah yeah I mean

2752.44 --> 2755.68
they can't it can't it won't eat the

2754.06 --> 2757.7999999999997
whole Apple

2755.68 --> 2761.859
very very much

2757.8 --> 2765.119
like yeah so like I mean only people are

2761.859 --> 2765.119
that crazy you know like so

2771.119 --> 2775.78
and a lot of those people's got stomach

2773.74 --> 2777.64
ulcers and everything and they

2775.78 --> 2778.42
they had summer cultures and all kinds

2777.64 --> 2781.18
of

2778.42 --> 2784.42
um that things in past the rise and all

2781.18 --> 2787.1189999999997
that yeah yeah yeah I mean so fruits are

2784.42 --> 2790.839
just a addition onto your diet you know

2787.119 --> 2794.079
like like Edition it's not a diet within

2790.839 --> 2794.0789999999997
itself yeah

2794.38 --> 2798.52
but very interesting about fruit because

2796.3 --> 2800.8
also that's what you find here you go in

2798.52 --> 2803.04
the supermarket of L right there at the

2800.8 --> 2806.38
corner and then that's what you want

2803.04 --> 2809.02
food for humans out there is seeds

2806.38 --> 2811.359
yeah okay see it's like rice is also

2809.02 --> 2812.92
seed grains all grains are seeds lentils

2811.359 --> 2815.98
are seeds these are seeds

2812.92 --> 2817.7400000000002
so seeds is the main food of humans like

2815.98 --> 2820.9
actually like not

2817.74 --> 2823.0
especially the pumpkin seed and I think

2820.9 --> 2824.98
there's something with the pumpkin very

2823.0 --> 2827.2
good for us it's orange first of all

2824.98 --> 2829.42
it's our wrench and it's the ear they

2827.2 --> 2831.46
tell us to throw it away to to discard

2829.42 --> 2833.319
them and to to throw them in the garbage

2831.46 --> 2835.7200000000003
because we only use them for Halloween

2833.319 --> 2838.359
and you know we put them in the The

2835.72 --> 2839.859
Psychotic thing yeah so most of the

2838.359 --> 2842.02
foods are seeds

2839.859 --> 2843.94
I mean like if actually if you look at

2842.02 --> 2847.359
it like James ingwitched in food and the

2843.94 --> 2849.7000000000003
whole thing is so and it must be very

2847.359 --> 2852.16
good for us to eat seeds

2849.7 --> 2853.66
yeah so seeds are the main and they're

2852.16 --> 2855.46
two like different kind of seeds are of

2853.66 --> 2856.7799999999997
different kind of things you know but in

2855.46 --> 2858.2200000000003
the west the whole diet system is

2856.78 --> 2860.44
totally wrong because they don't know

2858.22 --> 2861.4599999999996
anything about that like in the west I

2860.44 --> 2863.619
think whole thing was just a

2861.46 --> 2865.0
hunter-gatherer thing first from hunting

2863.619 --> 2866.98
now they suddenly think that they are

2865.0 --> 2868.42
like they know about that but they don't

2866.98 --> 2871.78
like you know and they're always

2868.42 --> 2873.16
confusing themselves and the the whole

2871.78 --> 2876.4
world they're trying to confuse all the

2873.16 --> 2878.2
time with that like so so that's just uh

2876.4 --> 2879.4
like a nonsensical thing I mean and

2878.2 --> 2880.54
people become vegetarian in the west

2879.4 --> 2883.0
also they don't know what to eat after

2880.54 --> 2883.72
that like it becomes a very very

2883.0 --> 2885.579
um

2883.72 --> 2888.48
like a problematic thing you know like

2885.579 --> 2891.46
for the West like what we eat now and

2888.48 --> 2893.5
vegetarian but then you turn around and

2891.46 --> 2895.3
you go drink beer wine you go to the

2893.5 --> 2898.02
scatec you go like you say in your books

2895.3 --> 2901.2400000000002
you go to Raves you go to you have a

2898.02 --> 2903.04
non-vegetarian lifestyle but yeah and

2901.24 --> 2903.9399999999996
with a vegetarian diet which you don't

2903.04 --> 2905.44
know what we

2903.94 --> 2906.88
eat on top of it you don't know what to

2905.44 --> 2908.5
eat then you have a lifestyle which is

2906.88 --> 2909.819
totally like what you call non-vision

2908.5 --> 2910.599
then you put a lot of strain on your

2909.819 --> 2912.4
system

2910.599 --> 2914.6800000000003
and then you just collapse basically

2912.4 --> 2915.819
like that's all which happens and then

2914.68 --> 2917.56
they blame it on vegetarianism that

2915.819 --> 2918.4
vegetarianism is bad like look what is

2917.56 --> 2921.2799999999997
happening

2918.4 --> 2923.859
look like you know then they they like

2921.28 --> 2925.0600000000004
no you know like it it like just because

2923.859 --> 2927.16
you don't know what to eat then you say

2925.06 --> 2928.119
vegetarianism itself is bad no so many

2927.16 --> 2930.46
books

2928.119 --> 2932.02
come out just on that just because you

2930.46 --> 2934.3
know like when you don't know what like

2932.02 --> 2936.3
so that's yeah

2934.3 --> 2939.46
so again you say fractal living

2936.3 --> 2941.7400000000002
environment avoiding big cities metal

2939.46 --> 2945.88
concrete buildings power lines mobile

2941.74 --> 2948.7599999999998
Towers Etc you recommend an old properly

2945.88 --> 2951.6400000000003
braided Landscapes Oceanside old growth

2948.76 --> 2954.099
for old growth forests a tree is a

2951.64 --> 2957.2799999999997
fractal ever wonder why boot got

2954.099 --> 2960.2200000000003
enlightened under an old tree feebase

2957.28 --> 2962.8590000000004
architecture using biologically friendly

2960.22 --> 2966.2799999999997
building materials like Granite bamboo

2962.859 --> 2967.72
amp and granite is very and wooden Stone

2966.28 --> 2969.8190000000004
and everything like you know like all of

2967.72 --> 2971.74
that like basically whatever like if

2969.819 --> 2973.72
you're in any kind of place there's

2971.74 --> 2974.9799999999996
always a soil from that area there is

2973.72 --> 2976.1189999999997
always Stone from that area there's

2974.98 --> 2978.52
always stuff

2976.119 --> 2981.52
in that area wherever you live to

2978.52 --> 2983.98
actually make structures out of you know

2981.52 --> 2986.2
and every place has that available most

2983.98 --> 2988.0
of them the time in so and the places

2986.2 --> 2989.9199999999996
which don't have that means they are not

2988.0 --> 2993.7
inhabitable anyways

2989.92 --> 2995.619
okay so yeah like like a desert I don't

2993.7 --> 2997.48
think it's very good like here every

2995.619 --> 2999.88
house is built with a foundation and

2997.48 --> 3001.92
it's Concrete in the ground that must

2999.88 --> 3003.48
disturb the chilleric current of the

3001.92 --> 3005.4
earth like there's a current there's an

3003.48 --> 3007.619
electric current underground yeah I mean

3005.4 --> 3009.599
obviously they make sure that the people

3007.619 --> 3012.02
make sure that the foundation itself is

3009.599 --> 3014.04
wrong of everything you know that is

3012.02 --> 3015.72
obviously the case that's what I've been

3014.04 --> 3017.16
saying that they don't take care of the

3015.72 --> 3019.319
foundation and stuff like that but

3017.16 --> 3020.819
Foundation you can do with a stone and

3019.319 --> 3022.56
stuff which is there in that area or

3020.819 --> 3024.96
anything like hard soil and anything

3022.56 --> 3027.2999999999997
like it doesn't have to be concrete like

3024.96 --> 3029.2200000000003
I mean there's been it's not necessary

3027.3 --> 3031.5600000000004
to have concrete as Foundation you know

3029.22 --> 3033.02
there were buildings before concrete

3031.56 --> 3036.9
like even

3033.02 --> 3038.94
out of clay comes Granite no yeah yeah

3036.9 --> 3040.98
so and I mean obviously Granite is

3038.94 --> 3042.0
harder than any or stronger than any

3040.98 --> 3047.22
concrete

3042.0 --> 3049.68
there is you know like yes yes next you

3047.22 --> 3052.2599999999998
say uh shareable thoughts I like that

3049.68 --> 3054.2999999999997
one I like that one sure maximizing

3052.26 --> 3057.38
touch which can be shared with anyone

3054.3 --> 3059.819
eliminates needs for secrets and storage

3057.38 --> 3062.4
zero storage infinite connectivity

3059.819 --> 3065.579
that's which relates to Pure principle

3062.4 --> 3067.7400000000002
if the universe like the patterns of

3065.579 --> 3070.559
nature functioning sacred geometry Etc

3067.74 --> 3072.4199999999996
but now the question I have for you you

3070.559 --> 3075.48
say touch which relate to the pure

3072.42 --> 3079.099
principle of the universe why use

3075.48 --> 3082.68
Universe here and that means verse okay

3079.099 --> 3084.9
because uh I am saying that thing to

3082.68 --> 3087.66
create a like because the basic

3084.9 --> 3090.9
principles few principles when they come

3087.66 --> 3093.0589999999997
and they are applicable everywhere okay

3090.9 --> 3094.7400000000002
so po principles are only one of the one

3093.059 --> 3096.6600000000003
like there is like like this called

3094.74 --> 3098.7599999999998
Brahman like this whole if you think

3096.66 --> 3100.859
take this thing as a whole then it's one

3098.76 --> 3103.079
as a whole then it has these pure

3100.859 --> 3107.5789999999997
principles as a whole so no matter which

3103.079 --> 3109.98
multi part you are in of it they apply

3107.579 --> 3112.5
okay it's these are not

3109.98 --> 3114.9
let's say like they're not subject

3112.5 --> 3117.599
to discussion okay they're not subject

3114.9 --> 3119.1600000000003
to like oh opinion they're not subject

3117.599 --> 3121.44
to that you people will actually talk

3119.16 --> 3124.0789999999997
about oh let's discuss this let's debate

3121.44 --> 3125.88
this this is not open to debate like

3124.079 --> 3128.52
this is not open to that thing that's

3125.88 --> 3131.94
why the uni okay I get it it's pure

3128.52 --> 3135.48
principles let's put it in one verse and

3131.94 --> 3137.099
it's undiscussed it is not open to

3135.48 --> 3139.92
debate it's not open to discussion it's

3137.099 --> 3142.619
not open to any kind of anything no

3139.92 --> 3144.599
matter what part of multi

3142.619 --> 3147.119
nest of the system you are living in

3144.599 --> 3149.7000000000003
okay these these things are not

3147.119 --> 3151.559
open to nothing they'll always be there

3149.7 --> 3153.54
they are Timeless they are Beyond Time

3151.559 --> 3155.8190000000004
and they'll always be they always were

3153.54 --> 3158.7599999999998
and always will be like there is no

3155.819 --> 3162.119
so in the principles I say often

3158.76 --> 3165.42
principles are the the territory where

3162.119 --> 3166.859
we uh and uh what I said also I don't

3165.42 --> 3169.26
remember I don't remember I'll come back

3166.859 --> 3171.7799999999997
with it but next you say a coherent

3169.26 --> 3174.48
emotions coherent emotion and that's

3171.78 --> 3176.8190000000004
what's missing in us most people is

3174.48 --> 3179.7
we're very in current with our emotional

3176.819 --> 3181.74
state and we don't Master like when you

3179.7 --> 3183.66
you want to have good first of all you

3181.74 --> 3186.0
want to have a great relationship with

3183.66 --> 3188.46
yourself you know to have great

3186.0 --> 3190.859
relationship with others so it's very

3188.46 --> 3193.859
important to bring those emotions to a

3190.859 --> 3196.92
coherent State and that's what you say

3193.859 --> 3200.22
uh often we've been talking about

3196.92 --> 3202.5
coherent CB4 of light and sound the

3200.22 --> 3207.24
fractal coherence or something that was

3202.5 --> 3212.66
part of it but emotions energy in motion

3207.24 --> 3216.0789999999997
directed to J Jean rate in compassion

3212.66 --> 3218.7599999999998
complete passion emotions which read

3216.079 --> 3222.6600000000003
beyond the normal realm of negativity

3218.76 --> 3226.079
sadness and despair or momentary joy

3222.66 --> 3228.48
happiness emotion which can connect one

3226.079 --> 3231.78
to say three

3228.48 --> 3235.319
cloud and in due course a star I love

3231.78 --> 3237.6600000000003
that yeah yeah that sick emotions that's

3235.319 --> 3240.74
what I'm talking about emotions which

3237.66 --> 3244.5589999999997
are like a laser instead of a Torchlight

3240.74 --> 3247.2
laser travels much harder because of its

3244.559 --> 3248.94
coherence yeah yeah yeah for coherence

3247.2 --> 3251.339
that the whole thing is has to be

3248.94 --> 3253.44
holistic okay you have to be in the

3251.339 --> 3255.359
cells of reality because you have to be

3253.44 --> 3257.7000000000003
in reality then you have to be holistic

3255.359 --> 3259.7999999999997
if you're not in reality or you're not

3257.7 --> 3261.24
holistic then you cannot have core and

3259.8 --> 3263.4
emotion your emotion will always be

3261.24 --> 3266.52
scattered you know it'll be scattergun

3263.4 --> 3268.26
emotions and you know like just feeding

3266.52 --> 3271.14
of this or that or just responding to

3268.26 --> 3273.119
this or that and not having an actual

3271.14 --> 3276.54
bigger picture

3273.119 --> 3278.6600000000003
in place okay and so that like that

3276.54 --> 3281.7599999999998
holism that's why the word holy is

3278.66 --> 3284.04
w-h-o-l-y like whole like it is not

3281.76 --> 3285.96
h-o-l-y only they just change the

3284.04 --> 3288.359
spelling in English to h o l y they took

3285.96 --> 3290.7
out the W you know which created all

3288.359 --> 3293.0989999999997
this sense of what is Holy actually what

3290.7 --> 3297.48
is holy holy is what is holistic is Holy

3293.099 --> 3299.52
okay so yeah so it's a word that is a

3297.48 --> 3302.7
bit hyperuse I think holistic and

3299.52 --> 3306.0
because here in the on my uh side of the

3302.7 --> 3308.8799999999997
ocean we have uh something that came out

3306.0 --> 3312.72
lately I'm hearing that and the holistic

3308.88 --> 3314.04
diet but also they eat the animals like

3312.72 --> 3316.2
what's only in the eating other

3314.04 --> 3318.599
sentences means they're like that

3316.2 --> 3320.52
doesn't means like having a proper idea

3318.599 --> 3321.839
of balance for the three tumors these

3320.52 --> 3323.099
people who are talking about that they

3321.839 --> 3325.7999999999997
don't even know there are three humors

3323.099 --> 3327.119
in the body okay they don't even know so

3325.8 --> 3329.52
when they talk about holistic that they

3327.119 --> 3331.5
don't even know what holistic is in the

3329.52 --> 3332.94
first place and what are they talking

3331.5 --> 3335.76
about

3332.94 --> 3336.7200000000003
in that particular aspect and that for

3335.76 --> 3340.079
that they don't understand the human

3336.72 --> 3341.4599999999996
body first you know so so so so so like

3340.079 --> 3342.6600000000003
I mean meet I mean because they don't

3341.46 --> 3345.44
even know that humans don't have the

3342.66 --> 3348.24
intestines to actually

3345.44 --> 3350.64
don't have the carnivore intestines and

3348.24 --> 3352.14
stuff like that so so for holism for is

3350.64 --> 3354.54
an actual realistic picture which I said

3352.14 --> 3356.04
use the word really reality with it you

3354.54 --> 3357.9
know when I use the word holism I used

3356.04 --> 3359.94
about the reality with it as well you

3357.9 --> 3362.1600000000003
know because without reality you can't

3359.94 --> 3363.66
have any holism like these people are

3362.16 --> 3366.7799999999997
not in a real

3363.66 --> 3369.66
istic framework of frame of mind and

3366.78 --> 3371.0400000000004
then all of your emotions are not real

3369.66 --> 3373.0789999999997
as well you find that they are just

3371.04 --> 3375.18
illusions that just pop up in your mind

3373.079 --> 3378.3
and then just go away like and that's

3375.18 --> 3379.74
all it is that's why I'm saying all uh

3378.3 --> 3382.8590000000004
lately I've been saying there's a

3379.74 --> 3384.7799999999997
difference with having a thought like I

3382.859 --> 3386.88
can sit down I have thoughts and

3384.78 --> 3389.28
thinking thinking and thoughts is

3386.88 --> 3391.1400000000003
different when you think you ask

3389.28 --> 3393.6600000000003
question deep question within yourself

3391.14 --> 3395.52
and you come up with answers but if you

3393.66 --> 3397.2
have just thoughts I can have thoughts

3395.52 --> 3399.599
all my life doesn't mean I'm thinking

3397.2 --> 3402.48
right yeah these are like fleeting waves

3399.599 --> 3404.7000000000003
which come and then the goal like like

3402.48 --> 3406.5
that's all like and that too

3404.7 --> 3408.18
um based on of your Notions and

3406.5 --> 3409.44
programming and

3408.18 --> 3410.8799999999997
um you know that things and stuff like

3409.44 --> 3414.78
that it's nothing to do with the reality

3410.88 --> 3416.4
of anything you know so so like people

3414.78 --> 3418.92
have to be really really wanting to like

3416.4 --> 3421.6800000000003
any doesn't start on anything has to be

3418.92 --> 3424.5
very very much a fan of being in reality

3421.68 --> 3426.839
okay like a person who's not that cannot

3424.5 --> 3429.42
start on any process of any kind of

3426.839 --> 3431.46
Awakening or or of any kind of evolution

3429.42 --> 3434.46
that's not possible for for any being

3431.46 --> 3435.54
who who wants to win fantasy and most of

3434.46 --> 3438.0
the thing in the media is about

3435.54 --> 3440.22
promoting fantasy and everything is more

3438.0 --> 3442.38
about fantasy so like so

3440.22 --> 3445.319
now to finish I'm going to finish with

3442.38 --> 3447.599
something that uh really probably I

3445.319 --> 3450.18
think that's what it me the most in that

3447.599 --> 3453.7200000000003
booklets what I'm gonna read now and

3450.18 --> 3456.24
that was to mean a revelation and it it

3453.72 --> 3458.2799999999997
it's it made really big sense I mean

3456.24 --> 3461.22
you're gonna see that there should okay

3458.28 --> 3464.0400000000004
now the most important bit

3461.22 --> 3466.02
okay it's very important there should be

3464.04 --> 3469.74
real humidity

3466.02 --> 3471.54
towards the benevolent iron beings which

3469.74 --> 3474.9599999999996
are closer to the state of perfection

3471.54 --> 3479.16
than one is this automatically allows

3474.96 --> 3483.359
for smooth Evolution yes this is the

3479.16 --> 3487.319
part that hit me in the heart yes yes

3483.359 --> 3489.7799999999997
the real Journey Only begins that's for

3487.319 --> 3495.3
all of you out there listening after one

3489.78 --> 3499.02
as a thing proper humility yes this is

3495.3 --> 3500.2200000000003
so big this is probably what and I'm

3499.02 --> 3503.28
happy you put that at the beginning

3500.22 --> 3505.4399999999996
because then it gives a lot of you have

3503.28 --> 3509.1600000000003
to have humidity yeah I mean obviously

3505.44 --> 3511.859
that is the basic uh psychological

3509.16 --> 3514.2799999999997
Behavioral

3511.859 --> 3518.16
blank you stand on

3514.28 --> 3521.579
to move forward okay without that you

3518.16 --> 3523.799
are not gonna move an inch forward okay

3521.579 --> 3526.98
no matter what you do no matter how many

3523.799 --> 3528.66
Goji berries you're eating oh how many

3526.98 --> 3530.819
of these things you're doing external

3528.66 --> 3533.7
things it will not make any difference

3530.819 --> 3536.4
if you don't have that okay so this is

3533.7 --> 3538.2599999999998
the most important bit you know like

3536.4 --> 3540.6600000000003
that that is the thing which

3538.26 --> 3544.1400000000003
um they are trying to actually take out

3540.66 --> 3547.6189999999997
from people by actually that's what I

3544.14 --> 3549.72
said by giving them chairs sofas beds

3547.619 --> 3552.1800000000003
everything has been given to take out

3549.72 --> 3554.16
humility only like so that you you

3552.18 --> 3555.48
always feel like a king and you always

3554.16 --> 3556.92
feel like that you are already that

3555.48 --> 3558.299
thing that you don't need to learn

3556.92 --> 3559.44
anything there's nothing you need to

3558.299 --> 3563.099
know nothing you need to change nothing

3559.44 --> 3564.9
you need to like so you you feel like

3563.099 --> 3566.7000000000003
that and then obviously humility is the

3564.9 --> 3568.38
last thing you have like people right

3566.7 --> 3570.24
now of this world like dreams like

3568.38 --> 3573.96
towards anything which teaches them

3570.24 --> 3575.3999999999996
anything real or proper or actual or

3573.96 --> 3578.16
anything they don't have any nothing

3575.4 --> 3580.02
yeah I mean they don't yeah I mean

3578.16 --> 3582.0589999999997
because if I wouldn't have that

3580.02 --> 3584.04
humbleness that humility I wouldn't be

3582.059 --> 3585.9
here that that's what brings me to you

3584.04 --> 3588.24
that's what brings me to other people is

3585.9 --> 3590.46
I I am very humble and I know I have a

3588.24 --> 3592.0789999999997
lot to learn and I see you like I said

3590.46 --> 3595.14
at the beginning I have no problem

3592.079 --> 3596.6400000000003
seeing you as a benevolent IR beings for

3595.14 --> 3599.819
sure you have done a lot more work than

3596.64 --> 3602.4
me you're very aligned you're very like

3599.819 --> 3605.819
I can even like I said see you as

3602.4 --> 3608.94
someone probably sent from the Divine or

3605.819 --> 3613.02
something but it's hard in my shape and

3608.94 --> 3615.9
my head in my man shape like I see you

3613.02 --> 3618.54
as a man just like me so that's where

3615.9 --> 3622.4
also we missed the humidity part because

3618.54 --> 3624.72
we see each other all in the same way

3622.4 --> 3627.299
you know what I am the only if I explain

3624.72 --> 3628.5589999999997
myself right like no but I'll see like

3627.299 --> 3630.96
I'll tell you people don't do like that

3628.559 --> 3632.52
like if people see guitar players okay

3630.96 --> 3633.7200000000003
and then say they'll say oh this guitar

3632.52 --> 3635.579
player is much better than this guitar

3633.72 --> 3637.98
player okay they are also human only

3635.579 --> 3639.119
like everybody is a man only but they

3637.98 --> 3641.28
can tell there's a quality difference

3639.119 --> 3642.7200000000003
between this player and that player and

3641.28 --> 3644.099
this player and that play they can tell

3642.72 --> 3648.8999999999996
the difference because the point is

3644.099 --> 3651.059
quality point is not just like what you

3648.9 --> 3653.339
see in the flesh or that thing even even

3651.059 --> 3655.02
that has quality but like there is a

3653.339 --> 3657.119
difference in quality in everything you

3655.02 --> 3659.099
know like so it's quality is where the

3657.119 --> 3662.099
thing is that you know the word quality

3659.099 --> 3663.78
is the main important Point here like

3662.099 --> 3665.7000000000003
you know like what is the quality like

3663.78 --> 3667.44
that's why like if I then use it or

3665.7 --> 3668.7
something and then nature responds and

3667.44 --> 3669.96
another person who plays music and

3668.7 --> 3671.819
nothing happens then there's a

3669.96 --> 3673.319
difference in quality of that sound and

3671.819 --> 3676.02
that music and that thing and stuff like

3673.319 --> 3677.819
so it's not a matter of just like seeing

3676.02 --> 3679.02
everybody as just like oh they are just

3677.819 --> 3680.52
like born like us and just because

3679.02 --> 3681.66
somebody's born like you and they die

3680.52 --> 3684.18
like doesn't mean that they're the same

3681.66 --> 3686.339
as you like you know like that doesn't

3684.18 --> 3689.7599999999998
make them equivalent

3686.339 --> 3693.0
to you or like yeah like there is a huge

3689.76 --> 3697.559
difference in um like um a perception

3693.0 --> 3699.48
quality like uh awareness knowledge all

3697.559 --> 3701.8190000000004
kinds of things like there is there's a

3699.48 --> 3703.559
huge difference in being like so yeah so

3701.819 --> 3706.68
that's called beingness what you are is

3703.559 --> 3710.94
a being okay that's it and but beingness

3706.68 --> 3712.44
has many many levels and no beings are

3710.94 --> 3714.599
equal okay

3712.44 --> 3716.28
that that people have to understand that

3714.599 --> 3718.1400000000003
like okay this is a very important point

3716.28 --> 3720.599
which we'll discuss next time yeah but

3718.14 --> 3722.7
that's it there's a place where we go

3720.599 --> 3724.44
through it in the book yeah we'll do it

3722.7 --> 3726.48
next time yeah so yeah yeah but we have

3724.44 --> 3728.7000000000003
a lot look we just went through it two

3726.48 --> 3730.5
three pages so we're gonna be a while

3728.7 --> 3732.2
talking about this because for sure it

3730.5 --> 3735.059
gave Clarity but I think we can bring

3732.2 --> 3737.22
even more clarity by talking together

3735.059 --> 3739.559
about it and having a discussion about

3737.22 --> 3742.14
it and yeah right right right come on

3739.559 --> 3745.5
okay so I really enjoy it and uh for

3742.14 --> 3749.16
sure enjoy because life is for us to

3745.5 --> 3752.339
cherish and full Joy always that's when

3749.16 --> 3754.98
I uh make my uh I think it's a noble

3752.339 --> 3756.299
goal to reach yes obviously if you're

3754.98 --> 3758.28
not after enjoyment then you're not

3756.299 --> 3760.14
gonna go higher then you can you can

3758.28 --> 3761.46
only go to hell because hell has pain

3760.14 --> 3763.14
and torture and you can go there there's

3761.46 --> 3766.38
no enjoyment

3763.14 --> 3768.0589999999997
yeah yeah no but it goes by stages but I

3766.38 --> 3770.579
know I at least I'm on the good

3768.059 --> 3773.88
foundation the good basic and I want to

3770.579 --> 3775.26
work on the basic because that's I have

3773.88 --> 3777.78
to return out there I have to learn

3775.26 --> 3780.3590000000004
everything from scratch so for sure no

3777.78 --> 3783.48
uh sorry about the basic and then that's

3780.359 --> 3786.24
good so that's good so even if the true

3783.48 --> 3788.4
man the true man so the true Man true

3786.24 --> 3790.799
means real like real like real so you

3788.4 --> 3793.26
have to get to the realness of being not

3790.799 --> 3795.42
that that was never planned that was
