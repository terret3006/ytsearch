1.639 --> 6.720000000000001
boom live and Direct on that woman show

4.86 --> 10.04
with my brother Master PT how are you

6.72 --> 12.899999999999999
I'm fine I'm fine um b-h-i-n-e fine yes

10.04 --> 16.02
pH yeah the pH has to be balanced yes

12.9 --> 18.9
for sure yeah yeah yeah if we want to

16.02 --> 20.82
have some clarity less fog in the brain

18.9 --> 24.119
you know I think that's what it is

20.82 --> 26.16
yes just gonna clear the fog that people

24.119 --> 28.5
may have in the brain I don't know if

26.16 --> 31.198999999999998
everybody has me I'm clearing it

28.5 --> 33.3
with some clarity you know not only this

31.199 --> 35.28
but other things other encounters you

33.3 --> 38.699999999999996
know you you make in life and

35.28 --> 41.64
gives you Clarity bigger uh like broader

38.7 --> 44.28
perception and greater perspective maybe

41.64 --> 46.32
I guess yes I mean the thing is that

44.28 --> 48.3
there's a lot of ignorance in this world

46.32 --> 50.219
in the people here and the beings here

48.3 --> 51.66
there's a lot of ignorance there so it's

50.219 --> 52.68
it's not like I mean everybody knows

51.66 --> 54.959999999999994
that

52.68 --> 57.42
um it's like more like an insane asylum

54.96 --> 60.78
the whole place like um there's a lot of

57.42 --> 63.539
insanity so so it is um so that is there

60.78 --> 66.92
like so it's more than a fog even I mean

63.539 --> 70.86
it's to the portable fog yes yes yes yes

66.92 --> 73.38
I was uh thinking I really send the I

70.86 --> 75.84
re-watched the talk we did the last week

73.38 --> 78.89999999999999
and last strong and I'm not weak that

75.84 --> 81.42
strong and I noticed something you said

78.9 --> 83.46000000000001
and it really really uh resonate with me

81.42 --> 85.86
all week all strong

83.46 --> 88.08
again I get caught up you know you see

85.86 --> 90.84
that's the conditioning it comes out by

88.08 --> 93.119
itself it's so weird sometimes that the

90.84 --> 95.28
words just that's why you have to think

93.119 --> 97.079
of the words you say do you know I I

95.28 --> 98.93900000000001
have a song that that's what it says in

97.079 --> 102.29899999999999
it you gotta think about the words you

98.939 --> 104.75899999999999
say every single time yes yes the

102.299 --> 106.5
discipline of it yes and uh yeah because

104.759 --> 108.42
uh there's a lot of blabbering going on

106.5 --> 110.159
people blabber all the time and without

108.42 --> 112.68
actually knowing what they're saying and

110.159 --> 114.18
so that creates more confusion on all

112.68 --> 116.159
the listeners people who listen and then

114.18 --> 118.619
people say oh that person said this this

116.159 --> 120.659
person said that now what do I make of

118.619 --> 122.88
this and what do I make of that and it

120.659 --> 124.97900000000001
creates it adds up to the confusion and

122.88 --> 128.57999999999998
you get more negative Karma

124.979 --> 130.739
for doing that kind of yeah thing and

128.58 --> 133.14000000000001
that that's why also I give a lot of

130.739 --> 135.78
attention is the word I use especially

133.14 --> 138.73899999999998
on YouTube Lively I mean I'm not in my

135.78 --> 141.42
living not my that's not my living room

138.739 --> 144.739
yes yes I'm not in the room here

141.42 --> 148.55999999999997
besidely with my people only yes yes yes

144.739 --> 151.8
okay the holy basil okay you brought

148.56 --> 153.66
that up the last talk and I heard you

151.8 --> 156.36
when you say it but you know when I do

153.66 --> 158.04
this talk I'm live with you so I like to

156.36 --> 160.68
really listen after from The Spectator

158.04 --> 163.739
review that's why I told Rosen and the

160.68 --> 166.019
holy basil that something now we're

163.739 --> 168.9
talking about not necessarily the best

166.019 --> 171.9
league that we eat yeah but it's very

168.9 --> 173.64000000000001
similar it's in the same family and I I

171.9 --> 176.04
was thinking about it and there's the

173.64 --> 178.73899999999998
word bezelik you know where the Catholic

176.04 --> 180.379
people have those big big church yes yes

178.739 --> 185.16
yes yes yes

180.379 --> 187.79999999999998
yeah yeah why this yeah yeah because the

185.16 --> 190.62
thing is that seed uh the point is that

187.8 --> 194.58
it is actually this plant which actually

190.62 --> 197.87900000000002
has all three humors balanced okay now

194.58 --> 199.8
so like uh that anything is in Balance

197.879 --> 204.17999999999998
like that that is automatically holy

199.8 --> 207.18
okay holy with a W h-o-l-y you know holy

204.18 --> 209.28
so so then if you have to have some

207.18 --> 211.5
Sacred Space or sacred architecture or

209.28 --> 214.2
then then you'll have the same basilics

211.5 --> 216.18
in that like to balance of the three

214.2 --> 218.7
elements so the same thing is used in

216.18 --> 221.54000000000002
architecture to balance

218.7 --> 221.54
the three

236.78 --> 242.34
they don't use that uh real uh proper

239.7 --> 245.39999999999998
technology for actual making buildings

242.34 --> 248.34
and and actually balancing the elements

245.4 --> 251.519
they don't do that so it is just a for

248.34 --> 253.68
name only not by function okay now we're

251.519 --> 255.59900000000002
gonna dive deep into uh the scriptures

253.68 --> 258.18
for the now for sure I mean that's a

255.599 --> 260.88
book I uh I read over over and over

258.18 --> 263.82
again and I will again the four prong

260.88 --> 266.28
approach okay and that's it I left when

263.82 --> 268.979
I read that I laugh as soon as I said

266.28 --> 271.38
that the first one he who knows not and

268.979 --> 274.86
knows not that he knows not is a fool

271.38 --> 277.32
for him yes you know he who knows not

274.86 --> 282.0
and knows that he knows not is a child

277.32 --> 286.56
teach him yes he who knows and knows not

282.0 --> 289.139
that he knows is asleep wake him and he

286.56 --> 291.24
who knows and knows that he knows is

289.139 --> 294.419
wise follow him

291.24 --> 296.04
yes yes so that that's the forest

294.419 --> 298.62
basically there's nothing you really

296.04 --> 301.199
much that had on this it is what it is

298.62 --> 303.12
now we're gonna dive into the basic

301.199 --> 305.88
definitions okay that's the section of

303.12 --> 308.4
the book for the viewers yes please and

305.88 --> 310.919
that's a really really great picture

308.4 --> 312.84
you have a lot of beautiful pictures in

310.919 --> 316.25899999999996
there that's Oregon I think that's

312.84 --> 319.979
Oregon coast yeah yeah so divine define

316.259 --> 320.94
okay that's uh that that's something in

319.979 --> 324.479
here

320.94 --> 326.82
one may ask what is divine as we are

324.479 --> 328.8
communicating in English we have to use

326.82 --> 333.479
the word divine

328.8 --> 335.699
which simply translates to die Vine or

333.479 --> 338.639
perfect branching because it comes

335.699 --> 342.41900000000004
closest to the characteristics of

338.639 --> 345.539
paramat man a Sanskrit term give me a

342.419 --> 348.79999999999995
chance with those terms yes God is too

345.539 --> 352.56
loaded a word mostly with misconception

348.8 --> 354.78000000000003
also it is a male term why Divine is

352.56 --> 356.94
beyond male and polar male female

354.78 --> 359.539
polarity

356.94 --> 362.759
even though

359.539 --> 366.479
or Divine is beyond the realm of words

362.759 --> 369.0
the simplest definition is

366.479 --> 371.58
the original creative spark which

369.0 --> 375.479
despite having created all the creations

371.58 --> 377.28
and dimensions lies outside of it all

375.479 --> 378.84
that's interesting I'm gonna come back

377.28 --> 380.82
on this I'm just going to read the other

378.84 --> 383.58
thing here Divine supports and

380.82 --> 386.18
encompasses all good Real Love Peace

383.58 --> 389.639
Harmony non-violence painlessness Etc

386.18 --> 392.759
many of the innumerable innumerable

389.639 --> 395.1
qualities of divine like Perfection on

392.759 --> 399.199
all levels are well documented in Vedic

395.1 --> 403.5
texts like the puranas ramayan Maha

399.199 --> 405.41900000000004
Mahabharata I get it so yeah so Devine

403.5 --> 407.819
tell me more about this because many

405.419 --> 410.4
people like you you just say the word

407.819 --> 414.66
divine and they get like a a weird

410.4 --> 416.28
feeling I to me it's very easy to talk

414.66 --> 418.259
about it very easy talk about Divine

416.28 --> 421.79999999999995
love and all these things that are

418.259 --> 424.97900000000004
natural to us more than other stuff so

421.8 --> 427.039
maybe you can extend and give you a

424.979 --> 430.56
yeah

427.039 --> 433.44
what I'm was trying to say in that was

430.56 --> 435.479
that Divine actually now is uh like can

433.44 --> 437.699
be is there like real science in a real

435.479 --> 440.039
science way like not fake science which

437.699 --> 442.319
they give us but like uh the real

440.039 --> 444.18
science way can be understood as perfect

442.319 --> 446.16
branching you know like uh like because

444.18 --> 450.06
dye is diverse you know like you have

446.16 --> 452.03900000000004
many many Die means many like you know

450.06 --> 454.62
like by means to

452.039 --> 457.8
uni means one by means two die means

454.62 --> 460.259
many okay and wine is branch is

457.8 --> 462.78000000000003
everybody knows wine is

460.259 --> 466.62
yeah like you know basic stuff yeah yeah

462.78 --> 469.79999999999995
so so wine so diverse branching in Phi

466.62 --> 472.38
ratio in golden ratio is divine okay in

469.8 --> 475.199
so when the when the golden ratio is

472.38 --> 479.46
applied to that the fire ratio then that

475.199 --> 482.099
becomes Divine in uh like a visual term

479.46 --> 485.4
in a math in a mathematical term okay

482.099 --> 488.039
like but on a psychological term or on

485.4 --> 490.02
any other level it is different okay so

488.039 --> 493.199
like we can understand these things now

490.02 --> 495.599
from a like a science perspective

493.199 --> 496.91900000000004
visual perspective uh which is

495.599 --> 499.319
fractality which you're seeing in the

496.919 --> 500.58
video Behind like okay so the same

499.319 --> 503.22
whatever is happening the same colors

500.58 --> 505.31899999999996
are happening on the sky okay so whether

503.22 --> 508.08000000000004
it's a visual perspective or like you

505.319 --> 511.139
can in terms of like a perfect tractor

508.08 --> 513.36
like mandelberg sets and other fractals

511.139 --> 517.979
and uh so there are different things

513.36 --> 520.38
visually which people can see now using

517.979 --> 522.24
3D animation and stuff which can

520.38 --> 523.919
actually give you a glimpse into oh if

522.24 --> 526.16
someone asks what is divine you know

523.919 --> 529.92
like you can show them okay this is

526.16 --> 532.14
divine okay like first in a visual term

529.92 --> 533.88
and stuff like that and then after that

532.14 --> 535.98
comes qualities qualities are different

533.88 --> 538.32
things like which is like uh what should

535.98 --> 541.32
be the quality of a Divine more Divine

538.32 --> 545.0400000000001
beings so like then like connection with

541.32 --> 548.22
nature you know and uh knowledge peace

545.04 --> 550.38
all these things you know what level of

548.22 --> 554.0
comprehension all these things come as

550.38 --> 558.3
qualities so those things uh are related

554.0 --> 560.04
to that okay but uh people have to start

558.3 --> 563.16
somewhere like right now we are not in

560.04 --> 565.8199999999999
this kind of Dark Ages where you can't

563.16 --> 569.2199999999999
tell or show people what divine is okay

565.82 --> 570.899
like so it it is it's not a matter of

569.22 --> 572.519
belief anymore you know like where

570.899 --> 574.32
people have to believe believe in

572.519 --> 576.42
something oh this is something we don't

574.32 --> 579.5400000000001
know maybe it's something

576.42 --> 581.9399999999999
who knows like that then that kind of

579.54 --> 583.56
ignorance is not like this is not the

581.94 --> 586.8000000000001
time for that kind of ignorance right

583.56 --> 589.6199999999999
now so it's it's like Humanity pretend

586.8 --> 592.019
that they can stand on the fence yeah

589.62 --> 594.18
yeah yeah yeah right I mean offense

592.019 --> 595.86
there's no in between it's one world or

594.18 --> 597.3599999999999
the other if you're not yes if you're

595.86 --> 599.76
not part of the solution you are the

597.36 --> 601.92
problem yeah it's it's reality it's like

599.76 --> 603.8389999999999
you have to face reality of right now in

601.92 --> 606.3
that you know we are not in that age

603.839 --> 608.519
like 100 years ago or 200 years ago

606.3 --> 609.54
where these things were not known where

608.519 --> 613.14
there are no computer animations

609.54 --> 614.6999999999999
Graphics anything or you know like even

613.14 --> 615.899
their films like whatever my friends are

614.7 --> 617.6400000000001
like we didn't have the cameras to

615.899 --> 621.0
everyone didn't have cameras to go

617.64 --> 622.68
around and uh document events I mean

621.0 --> 624.54
this has only started in the last 15

622.68 --> 625.68
years we have had the technology to

624.54 --> 627.18
actually

625.68 --> 630.0
like

627.18 --> 633.3599999999999
put this all out in front of people in a

630.0 --> 635.58
very clear way where there is no sort of

633.36 --> 637.8000000000001
running away from it you know so that's

635.58 --> 639.1800000000001
that's the same with crop circles or any

637.8 --> 640.62
of the phenomena like all those are

639.18 --> 642.2399999999999
happening in a way where they're

640.62 --> 644.94
documented people can't run away from

642.24 --> 647.1
this you know it's it's nothing which

644.94 --> 648.839
you can't run away from like so all the

647.1 --> 650.4590000000001
definitions of divine and everything are

648.839 --> 652.74
more clear now everything is clear what

650.459 --> 653.459
that is what is Holy Grail everything is

652.74 --> 657.0
known

653.459 --> 660.18
but only by a few like not the masses

657.0 --> 662.88
not the majority majority has no

660.18 --> 664.62
sense of it or any idea of it or

662.88 --> 667.2
anything and that is because of their

664.62 --> 669.779
now in these times that is because of

667.2 --> 671.0400000000001
their own choice it's not because it's

669.779 --> 673.5
not there

671.04 --> 676.56
it's because you don't want to know okay

673.5 --> 678.24
so then the blame comes squarely on you

676.56 --> 680.579
not on

678.24 --> 683.04
the fact that oh it wasn't available or

680.579 --> 683.88
it was not there or how could I know

683.04 --> 686.16
like

683.88 --> 688.68
we had no that those kind of excuses

686.16 --> 691.62
will not work now

688.68 --> 693.5999999999999
okay because the situation is different

691.62 --> 695.4590000000001
now everything is more out in the open

693.6 --> 697.8000000000001
it's more clear

695.459 --> 701.279
it's more in front of you you know if

697.8 --> 703.1999999999999
you still put your head under the sand

701.279 --> 705.0
I mean then that's your decision to put

703.2 --> 707.519
your head under the sand you know and

705.0 --> 709.7
that so and then accordingly things will

707.519 --> 712.86
happen to you according to your action

709.7 --> 714.72
officer whatever you do so these are not

712.86 --> 715.92
times where this kind of massive

714.72 --> 717.36
confusion is there and the thing is like

715.92 --> 719.64
in a lot of the

717.36 --> 721.86
like even the so-called Luther community

719.64 --> 724.26
people don't know these things okay in

721.86 --> 726.3000000000001
reality so people are more interested in

724.26 --> 728.64
just coming on channels and increasing

726.3 --> 730.8
their subscribe subscribers and

728.64 --> 733.079
um making a whole lot of you know like

730.8 --> 735.7199999999999
uh saying things with people would like

733.079 --> 737.64
to hear you know whenever you give them

735.72 --> 740.64
stuff like which okay like you can give

737.64 --> 742.38
them false hope what I call like you

740.64 --> 744.0
give them false hope you know like

742.38 --> 746.1
everyone you can just do it all you can

744.0 --> 747.36
just do it just like that you know like

746.1 --> 749.1
if you say these kind of things

747.36 --> 751.38
everybody likes to listen to that you

749.1 --> 753.48
might get like 100 000 subscribers in a

751.38 --> 756.779
month you know if you say stuff like

753.48 --> 758.82
that you know like I mean if you stay

756.779 --> 761.88
clear from reality

758.82 --> 764.1600000000001
and give people false hopes and false

761.88 --> 766.139
Illusions you know then everybody is

764.16 --> 768.66
ready for that I mean people have been

766.139 --> 771.839
programmed in 20th century by which is

768.66 --> 775.26
what I call a century of films you know

771.839 --> 777.9590000000001
it's a film Century where a movies were

775.26 --> 780.18
the main thing so a lot of Illusion and

777.959 --> 782.3389999999999
fantasy has been created by

780.18 --> 784.3199999999999
films already so people are already in

782.339 --> 786.5400000000001
that space where if you give them more

784.32 --> 788.7600000000001
of that then they are fine with that

786.54 --> 792.06
like without having to Face Reality so

788.76 --> 793.8
so so that kind of thing is there so uh

792.06 --> 796.6199999999999
all this what is happening is that

793.8 --> 799.38
people are not looking at what the

796.62 --> 801.0600000000001
actual things which are happening you

799.38 --> 803.16
know so like divine's definition for

801.06 --> 804.7199999999999
example it's there now it's very clear

803.16 --> 806.3389999999999
now and it's

804.72 --> 808.8000000000001
um people can actually see the fractal

806.339 --> 810.899
and see what divine looks like you know

808.8 --> 812.579
how it is an infinite Factor no matter

810.899 --> 814.68
how much you look into it look the same

812.579 --> 817.1999999999999
no matter how much you zoom in how much

814.68 --> 819.42
you zoom out it'll look the same so it's

817.2 --> 822.899
it's a like the even the definition of

819.42 --> 826.9799999999999
infinity what is in finite or in finite

822.899 --> 828.6
in knitted in Phi ratio is is all clear

826.98 --> 831.9590000000001
I mean if all of these things are much

828.6 --> 835.139
more known now it's not a mystery it's

831.959 --> 838.88
not some sort of you know like a story

835.139 --> 841.8
from Grandma okay or anything like that

838.88 --> 845.88
anymore so sure yeah especially with

841.8 --> 849.66
internet we have so much uh yeah so much

845.88 --> 852.54
stuff available to us to get clarity if

849.66 --> 855.24
again if you uh seek at the right at the

852.54 --> 857.0999999999999
right place like there's many charlatans

855.24 --> 860.1
out there you talk about it in your

857.1 --> 862.5600000000001
books yeah yeah yeah that is because uh

860.1 --> 863.76
people don't have any bases okay if you

862.56 --> 865.1999999999999
don't have any Basics if you don't have

863.76 --> 866.76
any connection with nature or Basics you

865.2 --> 868.62
don't have any common sense if you don't

866.76 --> 871.2
have any Common Sense after that it is

868.62 --> 873.9590000000001
impossible for you to be doubt anything

871.2 --> 876.48
or have any sense of discrimination okay

873.959 --> 878.579
so even through discriminate between

876.48 --> 880.139
fake science and real science okay

878.579 --> 882.12
requires discrimination okay which

880.139 --> 884.16
you've got to have I mean and how will

882.12 --> 886.079
you have that for that that's where the

884.16 --> 889.86
basics come into

886.079 --> 893.3389999999999
yeah and also when I observe around like

889.86 --> 895.0790000000001
I say often I don't see eight I don't I

893.339 --> 897.36
see it in the heart of people because

895.079 --> 899.76
they they choose to have it but I see

897.36 --> 902.6
love around I see Divine I see uh

899.76 --> 905.9399999999999
something very very

902.6 --> 908.88
I mean it's not to me the world I don't

905.94 --> 910.9200000000001
wake up each and every day and hell you

908.88 --> 913.5
know but that that's a choice to be in

910.92 --> 916.92
hell but Divine Divine is is it an

913.5 --> 919.26
automatic thing like do I see every like

916.92 --> 921.06
I say I see love I I even see I see

919.26 --> 922.86
people with good art it's not because

921.06 --> 926.0999999999999
they don't have a good heart but it's

922.86 --> 928.8000000000001
the Divinity is the Divine threat the

926.1 --> 930.24
Divine stuff automatic like you say at

928.8 --> 932.459
one point I think in the book that

930.24 --> 936.1800000000001
Consciousness is not an automatic thing

932.459 --> 939.3
so with divinity do you get the Divine

936.18 --> 941.519
stands automatic like are we all Divine

939.3 --> 944.8389999999999
and uh bingo or all the violence let's

941.519 --> 948.36
care about the rest the thing is that

944.839 --> 951.0
uh there's no like the thing is that

948.36 --> 952.8000000000001
people who beings who are here okay in

951.0 --> 954.899
this plane out here in this existence

952.8 --> 956.459
right now they are not now they're very

954.899 --> 959.399
far from Divine okay

956.459 --> 961.68
like I'll repeat very far okay that's

959.399 --> 964.399
why they have been put here okay like

961.68 --> 967.56
this is like a prison sort of situation

964.399 --> 970.199
for people who have gone against the

967.56 --> 971.279
laws of divine or laws of Multiverse

970.199 --> 973.68
okay

971.279 --> 977.16
so this is actually so you are actually

973.68 --> 979.62
like on a rebellion with Divine rather

977.16 --> 981.18
than being Divine okay like so it it

979.62 --> 983.579
might it has to be understood very very

981.18 --> 985.62
clearly like okay so whatever is

983.579 --> 988.3199999999999
considered good and stuff out here

985.62 --> 990.839
good the word good is not exactly really

988.32 --> 993.0600000000001
good like so people think that okay like

990.839 --> 996.1800000000001
maybe social service is good but social

993.06 --> 998.88
service is not good at all okay so so

996.18 --> 1001.519
like uh what people consider good out

998.88 --> 1002.54
there is just a way where you bond

1001.519 --> 1004.759
together

1002.54 --> 1006.74
in Rebellion against Divine actually

1004.759 --> 1008.24
because when you're doing the billion

1006.74 --> 1010.5790000000001
against Divine you are in trouble right

1008.24 --> 1011.899
so when you are in trouble you need to

1010.579 --> 1016.04
get together

1011.899 --> 1020.18
in order to uh like minimize the damage

1016.04 --> 1023.959
which is happening to you in in as a

1020.18 --> 1025.6989999999998
result of that uh Rebellion okay so so

1023.959 --> 1027.8799999999999
so that is what is actually happening so

1025.699 --> 1031.52
people so like we are all in it together

1027.88 --> 1033.679
sort of thing you know like okay you all

1031.52 --> 1035.9
only together only because you choose to

1033.679 --> 1037.5790000000002
go in a certain kind of way which is

1035.9 --> 1038.66
going against the Divine multiversary

1037.579 --> 1041.6
laws okay

1038.66 --> 1044.8390000000002
if you go if you if you're not rebelling

1041.6 --> 1047.839
against those then you can be alone

1044.839 --> 1050.72
and be fine okay like you don't need

1047.839 --> 1054.44
and support of another 100 000. people

1050.72 --> 1055.64
okay so so so so so so that's that's the

1054.44 --> 1057.2
that's the thing out there so people

1055.64 --> 1059.66
don't understand that it is not about

1057.2 --> 1062.179
like this definition of good

1059.66 --> 1063.02
where people support each other in this

1062.179 --> 1066.14
game

1063.02 --> 1068.539
which is basically a game which is

1066.14 --> 1071.48
actually a rebellion against Divine okay

1068.539 --> 1073.82
so so like that kind of supporting each

1071.48 --> 1078.1
other is not of any good use to yourself

1073.82 --> 1080.84
or to others like yeah yeah

1078.1 --> 1083.0
I lived it myself for sure without

1080.84 --> 1085.039
knowing you rebel against Divine but

1083.0 --> 1087.38
that's what we a lot of people say in

1085.039 --> 1090.2
this well I'm a rebel I'm a rebel I'm a

1087.38 --> 1094.22
rebel but if I don't think it's very

1090.2 --> 1097.16
good to rebel against Babylon or the

1094.22 --> 1099.679
system and and become like go in the

1097.16 --> 1102.2
streets and rebel and stuff and then you

1099.679 --> 1105.74
Rebel also against the vine so I don't

1102.2 --> 1107.9
think even the rebel works is this the

1105.74 --> 1110.72
true Rebellion right now go for each

1107.9 --> 1113.179
side the true Rebellion right now would

1110.72 --> 1115.28
be to go along with the Divine laws and

1113.179 --> 1118.76
Multiverse laws if anyone does that

1115.28 --> 1121.22
right now that person is a real Rebel

1118.76 --> 1123.2
okay the person who does the right thing

1121.22 --> 1125.84
right now because that will be going

1123.2 --> 1127.5800000000002
against the majority okay

1125.84 --> 1129.32
okay that will be the going against

1127.58 --> 1131.96
because all of that like you know like

1129.32 --> 1133.76
when you the way they rebel against the

1131.96 --> 1135.679
system also that is also show rebelling

1133.76 --> 1137.059
it's a show like if you go out on the

1135.679 --> 1138.38
street and just with banners and stuff

1137.059 --> 1141.559
that's just a show like it's not

1138.38 --> 1144.44
actually a real Rebellion okay you want

1141.559 --> 1147.86
that system to just somehow change to

1144.44 --> 1148.7
suit you okay like but the system by

1147.86 --> 1150.799
itself

1148.7 --> 1152.3600000000001
is not based on any Multiverse laws so

1150.799 --> 1155.6
it's not like you can tweak this or

1152.36 --> 1158.4799999999998
tweak that or tweak this in it to make

1155.6 --> 1160.2199999999998
it that thing the whole thing is upside

1158.48 --> 1162.98
down okay when the whole thing is upside

1160.22 --> 1165.919
down you cannot make changes or cosmetic

1162.98 --> 1168.14
changes to it or protest for cosmetic

1165.919 --> 1170.2990000000002
changes that is just uh full hardiness

1168.14 --> 1172.5200000000002
that's nonsensical it's a time waste

1170.299 --> 1174.74
it's a waste of energy and it's a waste

1172.52 --> 1178.039
of it's just like you're trying to show

1174.74 --> 1181.039
that I'm a good person okay or I care

1178.039 --> 1182.84
okay but this is not a matter of show

1181.039 --> 1184.76
all these are not matter of show this is

1182.84 --> 1186.26
a matter of actuality in reality it's

1184.76 --> 1189.26
not a matter of just showing something

1186.26 --> 1190.94
or creating an image of some kind you

1189.26 --> 1192.559
know where people look at you like oh

1190.94 --> 1194.38
yeah yeah this person is like this or

1192.559 --> 1197.66
this person is like it's not about that

1194.38 --> 1200.5390000000002
like so any actual uh going along with

1197.66 --> 1203.6000000000001
natural laws and divine laws is the real

1200.539 --> 1206.3799999999999
rebellion in this in these times like I

1203.6 --> 1209.36
think so I think so but people been

1206.38 --> 1211.4
learning go but I think we don't I was

1209.36 --> 1213.1999999999998
looking at the word responsibility also

1211.4 --> 1216.14
because it's very important to take our

1213.2 --> 1219.0800000000002
responsibility but uh I think the reason

1216.14 --> 1221.3600000000001
why we don't take responsibility or we

1219.08 --> 1224.059
don't see it is because we've been given

1221.36 --> 1227.299
the rights so to us we put ourselves in

1224.059 --> 1228.799
a box of Human Rights this is our rights

1227.299 --> 1231.08
you know so we don't have to take

1228.799 --> 1234.1399999999999
responsibility because that's all right

1231.08 --> 1236.1789999999999
you know and then we lose our meaning

1234.14 --> 1238.039
with life flow we lose the the big

1236.179 --> 1239.7800000000002
meaning with life and what can give

1238.039 --> 1243.2
meaning to your life is responsibility

1239.78 --> 1245.78
towards iron Divine today this is so

1243.2 --> 1248.419
clear to me uh prashantle so clearly

1245.78 --> 1250.28
that the road is towards a higher and

1248.419 --> 1252.6200000000001
praising and serving higher and divine

1250.28 --> 1255.26
there I say it every day repeat it every

1252.62 --> 1256.8799999999999
day it's very clear but there doesn't

1255.26 --> 1259.64
seems to be very clear for many people

1256.88 --> 1261.5
yeah yes because uh rights are like that

1259.64 --> 1263.66
thing okay it's a bratty thing okay like

1261.5 --> 1264.679
I have a right to do that thing uh

1263.66 --> 1266.72
people think they have a right to

1264.679 --> 1268.88
information right to this right to that

1266.72 --> 1270.679
try to okay just because you exist right

1268.88 --> 1274.64
means just because you exist

1270.679 --> 1278.419
the fact that you exist makes you uh

1274.64 --> 1280.3400000000001
like have certain things just because

1278.419 --> 1281.38
you exist okay not because of your

1280.34 --> 1284.6
action

1281.38 --> 1286.7
but but because of your existence just

1284.6 --> 1289.52
the fact that you exist

1286.7 --> 1292.64
um makes you like have certain things or

1289.52 --> 1294.559
certain like privileges just by existing

1292.64 --> 1297.5
okay so that is a funny Concept in

1294.559 --> 1300.2
itself that without action you will

1297.5 --> 1302.059
actually have that so so that is a like

1300.2 --> 1304.039
so in that way people share

1302.059 --> 1306.1399999999999
responsibility and that works well for

1304.039 --> 1309.02
like the being so controlling the system

1306.14 --> 1312.26
that because these people can be easily

1309.02 --> 1315.02
manipulated and cajol to do things yeah

1312.26 --> 1318.08
and then uh they have given a false

1315.02 --> 1321.1399999999999
sense of Rights and in end up Escalades

1318.08 --> 1323.72
you know so so you you have your slave

1321.14 --> 1326.539
rights basically which is uh which is

1323.72 --> 1329.3600000000001
not much like so yeah because a being

1326.539 --> 1331.039
that is uh have his head screwed

1329.36 --> 1333.74
properly on his shoulder knows how to

1331.039 --> 1336.5
behave in there like when I go out I

1333.74 --> 1338.96
know how to behave behave behave behave

1336.5 --> 1341.72
behave I know how to behave in society

1338.96 --> 1344.48
or in their Madness Network a shared

1341.72 --> 1346.1000000000001
Madness like you say yeah yeah that's

1344.48 --> 1347.9
what it is it's a network of shared

1346.1 --> 1351.02
Madness revealing against Divine

1347.9 --> 1353.0590000000002
literally and without awareness also and

1351.02 --> 1354.9189999999999
without awareness and this is so that's

1353.059 --> 1357.08
in the four-prong approach that you're

1354.919 --> 1359.419
saying yeah yeah I mean I mean the thing

1357.08 --> 1360.98
is like people's goodness is uh check

1359.419 --> 1363.14
quite quickly like okay if something

1360.98 --> 1365.0
higher comes in for them okay how do

1363.14 --> 1367.88
they react to it okay if something

1365.0 --> 1369.919
higher than themselves comes in front of

1367.88 --> 1372.3200000000002
them how do they react to it so their

1369.919 --> 1375.3200000000002
reaction tells you how good or bad or

1372.32 --> 1377.4189999999999
how far gone they are in the repellent

1375.32 --> 1380.48
is divine in the negative path you know

1377.419 --> 1382.88
so and maybe we don't recognize the

1380.48 --> 1385.4
Divinity and divine so much because

1382.88 --> 1388.1000000000001
we're too much also in our bubble and

1385.4 --> 1390.26
and being in our bubble we are bigger

1388.1 --> 1392.48
than God and it said oh at one point you

1390.26 --> 1394.28
say that we you become bigger than God

1392.48 --> 1395.9
most people it said oh they're bigger

1394.28 --> 1397.58
than God bigger than everything and

1395.9 --> 1401.0590000000002
that's all they see the well as they are

1397.58 --> 1404.12
you know that's one big mistake we do is

1401.059 --> 1406.7
seeing the world as as we are like it's

1404.12 --> 1408.62
so much more immense than myself yes yes

1406.7 --> 1410.1200000000001
but that's how all these things come you

1408.62 --> 1412.4599999999998
know like that's why people feel like

1410.12 --> 1415.3999999999999
this oh if things are so bad why does

1412.46 --> 1417.799
not God do this why does not God come

1415.4 --> 1420.26
and so like they become that thing and

1417.799 --> 1422.9
experts on what God should do

1420.26 --> 1425.72
as well like what yeah like that's true

1422.9 --> 1428.72
they're experts on what what higher

1425.72 --> 1430.76
being or any entity should do in a

1428.72 --> 1433.7
certain situation so that means they

1430.76 --> 1435.5
have more intelligence then that higher

1433.7 --> 1437.78
being or that God as to what should be

1435.5 --> 1439.88
done in any situation you know like so

1437.78 --> 1442.7
like um that is like putting yourself

1439.88 --> 1444.919
Above It Anyways again which is Again

1442.7 --> 1446.1200000000001
part of the Rebellion anyway so I mean

1444.919 --> 1447.8600000000001
you'll you see a lot of these comments

1446.12 --> 1449.6589999999999
All Over internet you know why doesn't

1447.86 --> 1452.12
God do this like right now I've stopped

1449.659 --> 1454.4
believing in God because things are so

1452.12 --> 1457.039
bad but God is not doing anything and

1454.4 --> 1459.38
all that you know you you can find

1457.039 --> 1462.1589999999999
millions of such things all over like

1459.38 --> 1465.0800000000002
you know so

1462.159 --> 1466.94
my mother always said help yourself in

1465.08 --> 1469.28
the sky well God will help you or the

1466.94 --> 1470.419
sky will I do

1469.28 --> 1472.7
yeah

1470.419 --> 1475.3400000000001
yeah I mean uh but instead of doing that

1472.7 --> 1476.78
it's always uh that thing has to what

1475.34 --> 1479.0
the other person should do or what

1476.78 --> 1481.3999999999999
higher being should do or what so-called

1479.0 --> 1483.799
like the this God term should do like

1481.4 --> 1485.659
you know like what uh there is always

1483.799 --> 1486.559
this thing not that you're gonna do

1485.659 --> 1489.3200000000002
something

1486.559 --> 1491.059
like it's it's what that thing is going

1489.32 --> 1492.1399999999999
to do like you know that's and there

1491.059 --> 1493.3999999999999
have been a lot of religions and stuff

1492.14 --> 1494.8400000000001
which have done that like which have put

1493.4 --> 1498.02
all the responsibility on something else

1494.84 --> 1500.0
than one's own action so so people are

1498.02 --> 1502.82
programmed in that kind of way in in in

1500.0 --> 1505.46
a lot of so-called

1502.82 --> 1507.08
um sects which have become religions

1505.46 --> 1510.679
they are sex only but they have become

1507.08 --> 1513.26
religion yeah so so here you go you say

1510.679 --> 1515.8400000000001
a Divine equals perfect fractality and

1513.26 --> 1518.0
perfect coherence okay you just purely

1515.84 --> 1520.52
perfect fractality and perfect coherence

1518.0 --> 1524.48
coherence is also the the

1520.52 --> 1526.7
the the congruence is congruence same as

1524.48 --> 1529.659
coherence yeah congruence is a starting

1526.7 --> 1532.64
point okay

1529.659 --> 1534.0800000000002
okay they start adding up yes like you

1532.64 --> 1536.0590000000002
know and like it's like making sense

1534.08 --> 1538.22
like if you say something it should add

1536.059 --> 1539.6589999999999
up like one thing you say to the next

1538.22 --> 1541.82
thing you say to the next thing you say

1539.659 --> 1543.5590000000002
should add up it should not fall apart

1541.82 --> 1546.3799999999999
at any point you know like that's

1543.559 --> 1549.1399999999999
coherence you know like if you if you

1546.38 --> 1551.2990000000002
speak something as a whole a truth at

1549.14 --> 1553.7
all points it should make sense through

1551.299 --> 1555.32
and through not like like it makes sense

1553.7 --> 1556.76
here but does not make sense there but

1555.32 --> 1558.5
makes sense here but does not make sense

1556.76 --> 1560.6
there it can't be like that when it's

1558.5 --> 1563.419
like that that's incoherence that's

1560.6 --> 1566.48
that's yeah you cannot it's like me

1563.419 --> 1568.22
coming here uh talking about truth and

1566.48 --> 1570.26
that but now I'm selling I'm trying to

1568.22 --> 1572.48
sell my car but there's a little little

1570.26 --> 1574.1
thing on it that needs to be fixed but I

1572.48 --> 1576.5
wouldn't say it to the people that buy

1574.1 --> 1580.36
it I would be very dishonest and like

1576.5 --> 1582.44
it's that's total incoherence

1580.36 --> 1584.6
don't say that thing don't say that

1582.44 --> 1586.8200000000002
thing but I insist on saying it because

1584.6 --> 1589.1
I said I cannot lie anymore I don't want

1586.82 --> 1591.1399999999999
to lie I want to be coherent with my

1589.1 --> 1593.6589999999999
being yeah but coherence is more than

1591.14 --> 1596.779
just like uh just saying little things

1593.659 --> 1598.5200000000002
in this this age or this world or this

1596.779 --> 1600.34
little things it's more than that it's

1598.52 --> 1603.1399999999999
coherence means actually making sense

1600.34 --> 1606.1999999999998
about everything like if you say

1603.14 --> 1608.2990000000002
something like any time like and people

1606.2 --> 1609.74
put it all together then the whole thing

1608.299 --> 1611.539
should make sense from all times you

1609.74 --> 1612.98
know like that's that's the thing like a

1611.539 --> 1615.44
lot of people in YouTube they come and

1612.98 --> 1618.02
say things like but say they say some

1615.44 --> 1621.26
right okay things and then they say some

1618.02 --> 1623.779
nonsensical things okay so there's some

1621.26 --> 1625.82
the sum total is not coherent you know

1623.779 --> 1628.94
like all things don't connect to

1625.82 --> 1630.9189999999999
everything right you know like like in a

1628.94 --> 1632.659
machine even like if everything is not

1630.919 --> 1633.74
connected right to everything it will

1632.659 --> 1636.44
not work

1633.74 --> 1638.1200000000001
exactly okay yeah so coherence is

1636.44 --> 1639.6200000000001
actually everything being connected

1638.12 --> 1641.8999999999999
right in the right ways in the right

1639.62 --> 1645.559
ways so that things make sense and

1641.9 --> 1648.02
things actually work okay so that's

1645.559 --> 1650.6589999999999
that's coherence okay like so like so

1648.02 --> 1652.22
that's in a psychological way like or

1650.659 --> 1654.5
anything like if some people are doing

1652.22 --> 1655.82
the diet right but they don't doing the

1654.5 --> 1657.32
psychological work if they're doing the

1655.82 --> 1658.3999999999999
psychological way they don't do the diet

1657.32 --> 1659.72
right if they're not doing the diet

1658.4 --> 1661.8200000000002
right they're not doing the other things

1659.72 --> 1663.6200000000001
right or they're not connecting with

1661.82 --> 1665.779
each other if you don't do the whole

1663.62 --> 1668.1789999999999
thing the holistic thing and the whole

1665.779 --> 1671.539
thing making sense as a whole

1668.179 --> 1674.299
then that is coherence okay like yeah

1671.539 --> 1677.72
yeah and you go and perfect fractality

1674.299 --> 1680.3799999999999
what exactly do you mean by perfect

1677.72 --> 1683.24
fractality I want to hear you again okay

1680.38 --> 1685.4
fractality is like this repeat is not a

1683.24 --> 1687.799
luxury because fatality works at many

1685.4 --> 1690.44
levels okay in fact you can see it as a

1687.799 --> 1692.9
mandelbross that set which factor means

1690.44 --> 1694.279
like where no matter where how much you

1692.9 --> 1697.159
zoom in and zoom out you can see the

1694.279 --> 1700.52
same thing that's a fractal okay like

1697.159 --> 1702.2600000000002
like in a design okay I mean it is there

1700.52 --> 1704.0
on my like that thing website

1702.26 --> 1706.22
resolution.net in the center there's a

1704.0 --> 1707.72
cup you know there's a cup within a cup

1706.22 --> 1709.7
within a cup within a cup within a cup

1707.72 --> 1711.02
you can zoom in infinitely you'll see

1709.7 --> 1714.26
the same thing you zoom out infinitely

1711.02 --> 1716.12
you'll see the same thing okay okay and

1714.26 --> 1718.34
like for example at this play which is

1716.12 --> 1720.4399999999998
I'm doing out here on the screen behind

1718.34 --> 1723.559
you okay so it was like gonna go past

1720.44 --> 1725.779
the Sun okay so I'm doing that play So

1723.559 --> 1729.559
then the sunlight is on me at that time

1725.779 --> 1731.72
when I'm saying that okay so so that's a

1729.559 --> 1733.52
fractality like what you were saying

1731.72 --> 1735.26
doing everything is in place like

1733.52 --> 1738.2
everything is together

1735.26 --> 1740.36
there's no feel it also yeah there is no

1738.2 --> 1744.26
actual separation

1740.36 --> 1745.52
okay in what you are saying and how what

1744.26 --> 1747.559
the events are happening around you your

1745.52 --> 1750.559
surroundings yourself everything it's

1747.559 --> 1754.1
all the same thing you know so so that

1750.559 --> 1757.279
is fractality in action inexperience for

1754.1 --> 1759.26
a you for a being like that is uh not

1757.279 --> 1762.5
just something on a screen which you see

1759.26 --> 1765.14
you know like uh like uh animation okay

1762.5 --> 1767.899
it's in your life okay in your being in

1765.14 --> 1769.94
a new existence okay right exactly you

1767.899 --> 1772.58
say it here what these are cannot be

1769.94 --> 1775.8200000000002
understood without a personal experience

1772.58 --> 1778.58
true divines Grace personal experience

1775.82 --> 1781.1589999999999
you know that's very important yes yes

1778.58 --> 1783.1999999999998
so so if if I'm doing this play and I

1781.159 --> 1784.5800000000002
have no son on me at that time like then

1783.2 --> 1786.32
it it won't make that much of a

1784.58 --> 1788.48
difference that play like and I'm doing

1786.32 --> 1790.82
that play when the sun is on me and that

1788.48 --> 1794.48
particular thing is there then only what

1790.82 --> 1797.0
words I said had relevance you know so

1794.48 --> 1798.799
what words you speak where I have to

1797.0 --> 1801.08
have that relevance of what is actually

1798.799 --> 1804.9189999999999
happening and what is that that moment

1801.08 --> 1808.22
okay like not something else you know so

1804.919 --> 1810.2
like so that is that so there is a whole

1808.22 --> 1811.7
lot of uh that thing with that that is a

1810.2 --> 1814.22
like I would say like very secondary

1811.7 --> 1816.26
tertiary thing for people right now for

1814.22 --> 1817.94
people just to do Basics is good enough

1816.26 --> 1822.08
like you know from my point of view like

1817.94 --> 1824.179
so yeah yeah and you go and say uh for

1822.08 --> 1826.6399999999999
sure in the present time space where I'm

1824.179 --> 1828.679
word PT Avatar is providing a glimpse

1826.64 --> 1831.26
but that's what we did now I'm gonna

1828.679 --> 1833.72
skip to to the other part as long as

1831.26 --> 1836.059
being stay humble to the Divine there is

1833.72 --> 1838.52
no pain or torture evil is Born the

1836.059 --> 1840.9189999999999
moment any being Rebels against Divine

1838.52 --> 1844.76
this rebellions arises simply from

1840.919 --> 1847.3400000000001
wanting praise for itself which it does

1844.76 --> 1849.14
not deserve I love this I love this

1847.34 --> 1850.82
because that's why people take selfies

1849.14 --> 1853.3400000000001
you know they go on fake book and

1850.82 --> 1855.6789999999999
plaster their with their wall with

1853.34 --> 1858.6789999999999
all kinds of stuff that to just to get

1855.679 --> 1861.14
praised but what are you doing exactly

1858.679 --> 1863.48
in life like what do you want on us to

1861.14 --> 1866.24
praise you like it

1863.48 --> 1868.58
yes because the point is like uh when

1866.24 --> 1871.279
you're a prisoner in a prison situation

1868.58 --> 1874.6399999999999
and a prisoner is taking selfie you know

1871.279 --> 1876.799
like so like if you are like if you are

1874.64 --> 1878.419
out of the prison and that thing and you

1876.799 --> 1880.1
show that if you take a prison that

1878.419 --> 1882.14
you're out of this prison that selfie

1880.1 --> 1883.82
will make some sense okay like you have

1882.14 --> 1885.74
done something you've broken free of the

1883.82 --> 1887.059
prison and now you're outside the prison

1885.74 --> 1888.74
and you're taking a selfie of yourself

1887.059 --> 1890.96
outside the prison because you're broken

1888.74 --> 1893.48
free okay so that'll tell other people

1890.96 --> 1896.6000000000001
oh this person is broken free okay so

1893.48 --> 1898.34
that is some has some meaning but to do

1896.6 --> 1902.24
that inside the prison which most people

1898.34 --> 1903.9189999999999
are and it makes no sense whatsoever for

1902.24 --> 1906.44
them to do that like you know because

1903.919 --> 1909.919
you are still in that

1906.44 --> 1911.3600000000001
like inside that uh bad situation you

1909.919 --> 1912.44
know you're not in a good situation like

1911.36 --> 1913.76
people just don't understand that

1912.44 --> 1916.8200000000002
they're not in a good situation like

1913.76 --> 1918.559
like and they try to hide that by

1916.82 --> 1920.12
getting praise and that the whole thing

1918.559 --> 1921.6789999999999
was like I mean that's for all this

1920.12 --> 1923.36
whole world in the west is about okay

1921.679 --> 1925.3990000000001
right Sports

1923.36 --> 1927.3799999999999
music industry all of that what is it

1925.399 --> 1929.7199999999998
about it's about Gathering praise right

1927.38 --> 1933.0800000000002
there is no other

1929.72 --> 1936.44
like like that thing you can find for it

1933.08 --> 1938.779
like there is no other reason for all

1936.44 --> 1940.46
those things to exist and and if like

1938.779 --> 1942.799
two people are boxing and one person

1940.46 --> 1944.1200000000001
wins in the boxing then that person gets

1942.799 --> 1945.02
praised for beating that other person

1944.12 --> 1947.4189999999999
right

1945.02 --> 1950.48
there is no other

1947.419 --> 1953.0590000000002
it always comes to this it always this

1950.48 --> 1955.34
Society is built like that to to reward

1953.059 --> 1958.1789999999999
the wicked like even though we reward

1955.34 --> 1960.799
the wicked people on TV yeah yeah

1958.179 --> 1962.2
like it's totally insane we knew it yeah

1960.799 --> 1964.52
I mean

1962.2 --> 1966.919
yeah I mean that's the whole point I

1964.52 --> 1969.3799999999999
mean because either you're gonna praise

1966.919 --> 1970.88
higher Divine and its qualities which

1969.38 --> 1973.7
actually actually exist which are

1970.88 --> 1976.1000000000001
reality or you'll see trace for yourself

1973.7 --> 1979.24
for qualities you don't have okay

1976.1 --> 1983.12
so so then that is the two

1979.24 --> 1985.3990000000001
thoughts are being can actually go by so

1983.12 --> 1987.1399999999999
but like not sticking to reality is the

1985.399 --> 1988.4599999999998
biggest problem here because uh for

1987.14 --> 1989.8990000000001
getting pace for yourself you'll have to

1988.46 --> 1991.76
not stick to reality because in reality

1989.899 --> 1995.2399999999998
you have not done anything pray is

1991.76 --> 1998.12
worthy okay and you're not doing

1995.24 --> 2000.88
anything and so like you are staying far

1998.12 --> 2003.34
clear of reality you know so and people

2000.88 --> 2005.3200000000002
get themselves all kinds of you know uh

2003.34 --> 2007.6589999999999
stuff like in this world to get

2005.32 --> 2009.399
different kind of plays and um I mean

2007.659 --> 2011.019
that's what a lot of uh YouTube channels

2009.399 --> 2014.9189999999999
are opening as well and stuff for that

2011.019 --> 2017.38
and you know like for people are giving

2014.919 --> 2019.3600000000001
praise to those people and when they

2017.38 --> 2021.94
actually don't deserve it you know and

2019.36 --> 2025.4189999999999
they're giving them half big half half

2021.94 --> 2028.059
cooked information which in turn is no

2025.419 --> 2030.039
of no use to anyone actually you know

2028.059 --> 2031.899
like and that's what people find like

2030.039 --> 2034.419
okay I got this information from this

2031.899 --> 2036.9399999999998
all these but it did nothing to my life

2034.419 --> 2038.8600000000001
it didn't change me in any way like it

2036.94 --> 2043.1200000000001
didn't give me any direction it didn't

2038.86 --> 2045.8799999999999
give me any sense of actual application

2043.12 --> 2048.6389999999997
which I can apply to my life and

2045.88 --> 2051.099
actually change in some way in a

2048.639 --> 2052.48
positive way like so so all all that is

2051.099 --> 2054.52
happening in the name of Praise only

2052.48 --> 2056.679
Gathering and it has it is there in

2054.52 --> 2058.72
every strata of this thing and that's

2056.679 --> 2060.52
where the Rebellion to me the core point

2058.72 --> 2062.6789999999996
of the Rebellion is that's the core

2060.52 --> 2066.639
point of the Rebellion basically yeah

2062.679 --> 2069.7000000000003
right there yeah it's Elementary my dear

2066.639 --> 2072.879
listen yeah after severe disconnection

2069.7 --> 2075.46
from nature and creating a plasticky

2072.879 --> 2077.3199999999997
concretely blissless world people's

2075.46 --> 2079.54
definition of divinity doesn't carry

2077.32 --> 2082.54
connection with elements

2079.54 --> 2084.52
when Divinity is has always been always

2082.54 --> 2087.7599999999998
will be all about connection and

2084.52 --> 2091.0
manifestation through elements there is

2087.76 --> 2094.179
a reason why the Elementos are the

2091.0 --> 2097.0
Devils demigods the guys the real good

2094.179 --> 2100.92
Fellas in Vedic wisdom

2097.0 --> 2105.119
acne fire deity

2100.92 --> 2108.64
Varun water deity their head being Indra

2105.119 --> 2111.28
wielder of Thunderbolt their mother

2108.64 --> 2114.48
being Aditi Sky deity The Fifth Element

2111.28 --> 2116.44
their support being

2114.48 --> 2119.44
Earth deity

2116.44 --> 2121.78
the body is made up of these elements

2119.44 --> 2124.48
only and the Soul Essence to higher

2121.78 --> 2125.92
realm only after purification of this of

2124.48 --> 2129.28
the elements

2125.92 --> 2132.16
element is Elementary the device are

2129.28 --> 2135.0400000000004
always an event only because they always

2132.16 --> 2138.04
bow but do you say bow or Bow Bow Bow

2135.04 --> 2141.22
Bow okay I have I you saw me struggling

2138.04 --> 2144.64
in my video with that word yes yes bow

2141.22 --> 2146.98
to the source Divine that's it no that

2144.64 --> 2148.96
that's powerful right there the the

2146.98 --> 2150.88
elements the but this is not something

2148.96 --> 2153.76
we're totally disconnected from nature

2150.88 --> 2156.04
like you say so the elements what we see

2153.76 --> 2157.9
of the elements is a periodic table of

2156.04 --> 2160.18
elements you know that's the notion I

2157.9 --> 2163.48
had of elements was outside of myself

2160.18 --> 2167.7999999999997
was an ad to be alchemized or something

2163.48 --> 2171.04
within me or so we're so disconnected

2167.8 --> 2172.599
let's say it's crazy and yes again the

2171.04 --> 2174.94
connection with nature doesn't happen

2172.599 --> 2177.76
just by like you say going to a pristine

2174.94 --> 2179.92
spot and sit there and then enjoy the

2177.76 --> 2181.6600000000003
the nature and say oh I'm connected to

2179.92 --> 2183.46
Nature it's much more than that I would

2181.66 --> 2185.2599999999998
like you to extend on the connection to

2183.46 --> 2187.359
elements and how to to play with the

2185.26 --> 2189.6400000000003
elements also yeah I mean the thing is

2187.359 --> 2191.7999999999997
that humility is required first right

2189.64 --> 2194.56
like so if you see something good in

2191.8 --> 2196.8390000000004
nature you have to be able to actually

2194.56 --> 2198.7599999999998
say that this is good and what's good

2196.839 --> 2201.46
about it and like you have to be able to

2198.76 --> 2204.7000000000003
word that from your mouth and speak it

2201.46 --> 2207.94
from your mouth you know so so that is

2204.7 --> 2209.5
your like uh what I would say like that

2207.94 --> 2213.099
you're praising

2209.5 --> 2214.72
okay that is your acknowledgment of it

2213.099 --> 2216.28
like you know like it's not just if

2214.72 --> 2217.839
you're not acknowledging it you know and

2216.28 --> 2219.52
if you acknowledge it and then

2217.839 --> 2221.68
afterwards you get into a sense of

2219.52 --> 2223.78
praise and the same same sense of Praise

2221.68 --> 2225.8199999999997
will get from nature to Divine you know

2223.78 --> 2228.7000000000003
that's not much of a jump

2225.82 --> 2230.38
to do then from praising nature to

2228.7 --> 2232.0
praising Divine like it's not much of a

2230.38 --> 2233.859
but if you don't have any practice

2232.0 --> 2235.96
like if your practice is only praising

2233.859 --> 2239.02
uh like um like fake Hollywood deities

2235.96 --> 2240.82
and play Hollywood Stars fake Stars okay

2239.02 --> 2242.859
then then you then you have a problem

2240.82 --> 2244.78
you know then when you're used to go to

2242.859 --> 2247.359
Divine you have a problem then you know

2244.78 --> 2250.0
you don't know like because that's not a

2247.359 --> 2252.16
meeting the parameters which you are

2250.0 --> 2255.339
actually praising and those parameters

2252.16 --> 2257.68
were not actually praiseworthy so so

2255.339 --> 2259.66
that's so that's what happens so so

2257.68 --> 2261.7599999999998
that's where like when you go get into

2259.66 --> 2264.3999999999996
touch with nature little humility is

2261.76 --> 2266.44
required you know and uh beings lack

2264.4 --> 2268.2400000000002
that humility right now as a whole in

2266.44 --> 2271.2400000000002
the way they walk the way they talk the

2268.24 --> 2272.6189999999997
way they are I mean people are quite uh

2271.24 --> 2274.4799999999996
um an humble in all the nature Sports

2272.619 --> 2276.52
the way they even that thing you know

2274.48 --> 2279.4
the kind of the touristy way they go

2276.52 --> 2281.56
there and you know we look we look but

2279.4 --> 2283.3
we don't observe yeah yeah but even just

2281.56 --> 2286.0
your own body language of people there

2283.3 --> 2287.26
is not respectful I mean you can tell by

2286.0 --> 2289.599
the ball language if you just do a half

2287.26 --> 2292.3590000000004
an hour film of them walking arrogance

2289.599 --> 2296.02
yep yeah like you will get the picture

2292.359 --> 2298.06
you know like oh yeah you can see it

2296.02 --> 2302.44
when you just when you go uh roam around

2298.06 --> 2304.0
even yesterday yesterday looking just a

2302.44 --> 2305.68
small example yesterday I'm at the

2304.0 --> 2307.78
chilling spot where I make those video

2305.68 --> 2310.18
and I'm sitting there in the corner like

2307.78 --> 2312.6400000000003
I'm alone in at the end near the Falls

2310.18 --> 2314.859
like there's maybe a I don't know four

2312.64 --> 2316.9
foot by four foot space I have my chair

2314.859 --> 2318.88
there all my stuff

2316.9 --> 2321.579
I have the camera in front of me I'm

2318.88 --> 2324.339
talking to the camera there's a man that

2321.579 --> 2327.3390000000004
come right right beside me behind me

2324.339 --> 2330.64
behind the camera like I'm not there at

2327.339 --> 2332.56
all like no manners whatsoever yes no I

2330.64 --> 2335.02
would have never done this not that the

2332.56 --> 2337.599
spot belonged to me no but but it's just

2335.02 --> 2339.359
like is there body language and and then

2337.599 --> 2341.38
people you know like

2339.359 --> 2343.54
you know like people go there and do

2341.38 --> 2345.76
river rafting you know in a river like

2343.54 --> 2347.44
okay so like how is that respecting the

2345.76 --> 2349.0
river right like

2347.44 --> 2350.619
you are trying to fight with it you're

2349.0 --> 2353.44
trying to overcome it

2350.619 --> 2355.6600000000003
you know you're not respecting it you

2353.44 --> 2357.94
know like you know people do hiking and

2355.66 --> 2360.64
stuff like again you are challenging

2357.94 --> 2363.88
yourself against the nature that's what

2360.64 --> 2366.04
hiking is about right it's not

2363.88 --> 2367.78
anything to do with respect or anything

2366.04 --> 2369.88
of that thing you know like you're just

2367.78 --> 2371.2000000000003
like torturing yourself with a big heavy

2369.88 --> 2373.3
load on your back and you're just

2371.2 --> 2374.7999999999997
running around there and and when you're

2373.3 --> 2376.3
doing that like last thing you can do is

2374.8 --> 2378.28
appreciate

2376.3 --> 2380.44
anything exactly because you go there to

2378.28 --> 2382.1800000000003
con care the mountain like your goal in

2380.44 --> 2383.98
your head is you're gonna have some that

2382.18 --> 2385.44
mountain you're gonna conquer it like

2383.98 --> 2389.14
yeah

2385.44 --> 2391.9
just take time you know to climb and

2389.14 --> 2392.98
take breaks and you know make it you

2391.9 --> 2394.42
don't have to climb that for that you

2392.98 --> 2396.76
can appreciate it from a distance you

2394.42 --> 2398.2000000000003
don't have to exactly yeah yeah I mean

2396.76 --> 2399.94
you'll only see the mountain from a

2398.2 --> 2401.0789999999997
distance you will never see it while you

2399.94 --> 2403.359
are on it like

2401.079 --> 2405.04
it's it's like The Madness of escalating

2403.359 --> 2406.96
Mount Everest what do you think about

2405.04 --> 2408.579
that like yeah I mean it's I mean it's

2406.96 --> 2409.839
just I mean it's just another pain and

2408.579 --> 2411.579
torture device I mean you go there

2409.839 --> 2413.2
you'll get frostbite a lot of people get

2411.579 --> 2415.2400000000002
frostbite and then they have other

2413.2 --> 2416.4399999999996
people to lift their stuff as well they

2415.24 --> 2418.5989999999997
don't climb with all their stuff

2416.44 --> 2420.88
themselves they have to have some people

2418.599 --> 2422.44
local people to lift their stuff lift

2420.88 --> 2424.9
share parts and stuff lift their stuff

2422.44 --> 2426.94
up like I mean so it's just the same

2424.9 --> 2429.2200000000003
nonsensical game I mean it's nothing to

2426.94 --> 2431.32
do with nature at all you know like I

2429.22 --> 2433.18
mean the base camp of Mount Everest must

2431.32 --> 2437.8
be one of the most polluted spots on

2433.18 --> 2440.2599999999998
earth like you know so so so so so so so

2437.8 --> 2442.7200000000003
you can well imagine what the situation

2440.26 --> 2445.7200000000003
with that is you know so I mean that is

2442.72 --> 2448.9599999999996
just nothing to do with appreciation

2445.72 --> 2451.56
the whole mentality is totally wrong

2448.96 --> 2454.96
look what you're doing there that's very

2451.56 --> 2457.119
significatively I look that's what it is

2454.96 --> 2460.0
playing with the elements yeah yeah yeah

2457.119 --> 2461.1400000000003
yeah yeah yeah I mean but uh I mean but

2460.0 --> 2464.38
for that I don't have to physically

2461.14 --> 2466.7799999999997
exert myself in any way you know I'm not

2464.38 --> 2468.46
exerting myself in any physical way for

2466.78 --> 2470.32
that you know so it just happened

2468.46 --> 2472.06
natural yeah yeah so like what I'm

2470.32 --> 2474.46
saying is uh like that's the whole point

2472.06 --> 2476.2599999999998
like you know like if you are doing

2474.46 --> 2477.82
anything against nature like if you're

2476.26 --> 2480.1600000000003
going against the current then only you

2477.82 --> 2482.079
will have to exert you know like

2480.16 --> 2484.359
otherwise you don't have to exert

2482.079 --> 2486.46
yourself you know like so when you are

2484.359 --> 2487.54
going with the flow then you don't have

2486.46 --> 2490.839
to

2487.54 --> 2494.02
and I have another thing to talk to you

2490.839 --> 2495.7
about could storms like hurricane be

2494.02 --> 2497.5
very Divine because I was watching a

2495.7 --> 2500.0789999999997
video the other day and a guy was

2497.5 --> 2502.359
talking about our our thumbnail our

2500.079 --> 2505.0
thumb uh print on it you know like the

2502.359 --> 2507.0989999999997
shape of the fingerprint here yeah it's

2505.0 --> 2510.04
the same as a hurricane so could the

2507.099 --> 2512.1400000000003
hurricane be the the Fingerprints of the

2510.04 --> 2514.359
Divine or something like that but that's

2512.14 --> 2515.92
fine like when this book which bees

2514.359 --> 2517.24
guitar was released you know this book

2515.92 --> 2519.64
was released

2517.24 --> 2521.2
um then uh hurricane Gita came like a

2519.64 --> 2524.68
cyclone Gita

2521.2 --> 2527.7999999999997
okay came in the Pacific Ocean okay yeah

2524.68 --> 2530.44
so just after this was released so you

2527.8 --> 2532.54
know so so you can see I mean I mean I

2530.44 --> 2536.32
mean I've had so many films or judgment

2532.54 --> 2539.2599999999998
updates which of all the storms which uh

2536.32 --> 2541.54
have been uh created in a Divine Way and

2539.26 --> 2544.3590000000004
are created doing a purification around

2541.54 --> 2547.18
the earth and and I like this is a storm

2544.359 --> 2549.0989999999997
in Australia you know uh like I was in

2547.18 --> 2551.6189999999997
the center and the with the previous

2549.099 --> 2553.42
clip not this one you know the previous

2551.619 --> 2556.5
clip like which was there you know like

2553.42 --> 2556.5
with the lightning

2558.87 --> 2561.96
[Music]

2568.74 --> 2574.66
uh then this within uh like a day this

2573.099 --> 2576.099
whole thing became equal to the size of

2574.66 --> 2578.7999999999997
Australia

2576.099 --> 2582.1600000000003
it became equal to the size of Australia

2578.8 --> 2585.1600000000003
this town there was nothing from zero to

2582.16 --> 2587.92
this size of Australia like so so then

2585.16 --> 2591.16
uh so then obviously uh you know I mean

2587.92 --> 2594.2200000000003
the storms can be created and hurricanes

2591.16 --> 2596.92
can be created and in the like uh

2594.22 --> 2598.8999999999996
English uh like Sanskrit the word Hari

2596.92 --> 2602.26
is for divine

2598.9 --> 2605.6800000000003
and Kane you know is a stick so it's

2602.26 --> 2607.8390000000004
like Divine stick you know like

2605.68 --> 2610.4199999999996
that that's why they used to hit you

2607.839 --> 2612.94
with the ruler in school yeah yeah so

2610.42 --> 2615.28
it's a it's it's a hurricane it's a cane

2612.94 --> 2618.94
of hurricane like which is another name

2615.28 --> 2620.92
for divine in there so yeah so higher

2618.94 --> 2623.14
and lower okay this is very interesting

2620.92 --> 2627.52
uh higher nowhere in a world where

2623.14 --> 2630.4
equality is a mass slogan propagated by

2627.52 --> 2634.359
evil minions applied to gender race

2630.4 --> 2636.599
beings Etc and higher lower are seen as

2634.359 --> 2640.359
swear words

2636.599 --> 2642.6400000000003
declares that there is higher in the

2640.359 --> 2646.06
world the definition of a higher being

2642.64 --> 2648.22
is quite simple a being is higher than

2646.06 --> 2650.64
oneself if the being is more connected

2648.22 --> 2655.7799999999997
to the Divine then one is

2650.64 --> 2658.7799999999997
regarding how will we no gno very

2655.78 --> 2660.94
important Etc it is very clear within

2658.78 --> 2662.5
the first sentence then to those that

2660.94 --> 2664.78
are honest

2662.5 --> 2666.64
if one doesn't know how to behave

2664.78 --> 2669.88
properly again that's what I was saying

2666.64 --> 2672.4
with the higher being one has no chance

2669.88 --> 2674.319
of progressing towards the Eternal

2672.4 --> 2676.599
delicious overwhelming Bliss that is

2674.319 --> 2678.7599999999998
divine and that's what happened exactly

2676.599 --> 2680.319
yesterday to me like I wasn't intended

2678.76 --> 2683.0200000000004
like I could have

2680.319 --> 2685.7799999999997
talk like for hours and hours with that

2683.02 --> 2688.48
guy eliminate and clarify his whole

2685.78 --> 2691.2400000000002
existence but because of his behavior I

2688.48 --> 2694.9
did not even mention a single word

2691.24 --> 2697.2999999999997
yes yes yeah but but but but that that's

2694.9 --> 2699.64
the whole thing you know like uh like

2697.3 --> 2701.6800000000003
this equality thing that everything is

2699.64 --> 2703.359
equal but that's not true that's not I

2701.68 --> 2704.7999999999997
mean even all the plants are not equal

2703.359 --> 2707.14
nothing is

2704.8 --> 2709.54
equal like I mean everything has

2707.14 --> 2711.8799999999997
different level of being and standing in

2709.54 --> 2714.04
vibration and stuff like so like there's

2711.88 --> 2716.5
a charge and there's a charge coherence

2714.04 --> 2718.54
so even what you call your spirit which

2716.5 --> 2720.819
inside you is your charge cores inside

2718.54 --> 2723.2799999999997
your being so even at your very core

2720.819 --> 2725.02
level of your being that charge and

2723.28 --> 2729.1600000000003
coherence in different beings is not the

2725.02 --> 2730.72
same so no two beings are the same in

2729.16 --> 2732.64
their charge and level of charge codes

2730.72 --> 2734.9199999999996
and there is more stronger ones and

2732.64 --> 2737.2599999999998
there are weaker ones there are more and

2734.92 --> 2739.54
there are less okay like there is a this

2737.26 --> 2741.88
is the reality of the thing and like

2739.54 --> 2743.5
Divine is like perfect fatality then

2741.88 --> 2744.94
then there'll be less than perfect and

2743.5 --> 2747.94
there will be less less less less less

2744.94 --> 2750.339
less like so there'll be a huge strata

2747.94 --> 2752.14
of that it's not like like there's going

2750.339 --> 2754.96
to be a whole nothing of it it's not

2752.14 --> 2757.18
just gonna be you know like uh

2754.96 --> 2758.619
everybody's equal which is a what I call

2757.18 --> 2761.52
a new age lie

2758.619 --> 2764.619
where it has been propagated in the last

2761.52 --> 2766.599
150 years and people find it that in

2764.619 --> 2768.88
reality it doesn't work anywhere you

2766.599 --> 2771.28
know if you're actually in any kind of

2768.88 --> 2772.359
reality try to make it work it's not

2771.28 --> 2774.2200000000003
going to work because that's not the

2772.359 --> 2777.5789999999997
reality of any kind in the first place

2774.22 --> 2779.2
like so so like I mean if people think

2777.579 --> 2781.6600000000003
that oh yeah if this person can do this

2779.2 --> 2784.1189999999997
I can do this too then I mean but it's

2781.66 --> 2787.359
not going to happen you know like uh

2784.119 --> 2788.92
it's that's not how it works like so so

2787.359 --> 2791.319
people again it's it's just again

2788.92 --> 2793.54
running away from reality and if people

2791.319 --> 2795.52
keep this equality thing then there is

2793.54 --> 2797.319
no evolution possible okay if

2795.52 --> 2799.839
everybody's equal then no one needs to

2797.319 --> 2802.48
work for anything to get any higher or

2799.839 --> 2803.68
get to a higher state no one needs to do

2802.48 --> 2804.52
anything like you know like you already

2803.68 --> 2806.6189999999997
there

2804.52 --> 2809.079
if you're already there then you don't

2806.619 --> 2811.1800000000003
really need to do anything so then

2809.079 --> 2814.7200000000003
I'm saying that takes away from any

2811.18 --> 2816.7
action any real positive action

2814.72 --> 2818.319
for like you can see how it

2816.7 --> 2820.4199999999996
psychologically affects people in that

2818.319 --> 2821.74
way which then they think that they are

2820.42 --> 2825.819
fine as they are

2821.74 --> 2828.4599999999996
okay but how you are as as you are like

2825.819 --> 2830.5
is not fun or is not good anyways like

2828.46 --> 2832.119
it's not giving you any pleasure or

2830.5 --> 2834.04
Bliss you're getting problems and you're

2832.119 --> 2836.44
getting all kinds of

2834.04 --> 2838.3
um wrong things happening to you so like

2836.44 --> 2840.52
it's not good enough like so obviously

2838.3 --> 2844.0
there is a higher state than your state

2840.52 --> 2845.98
okay so yeah that's it the pain and

2844.0 --> 2847.839
torture again the pain I have

2845.98 --> 2850.119
experienced pain for sure in my life but

2847.839 --> 2853.06
the torture the torture thing yesterday

2850.119 --> 2855.28
I was talking about that and it happens

2853.06 --> 2857.44
to us for sure when but we torture the

2855.28 --> 2860.079
souls I think because I've never been

2857.44 --> 2863.98
like really tortured physically I've

2860.079 --> 2866.6800000000003
never like suffered the physically and

2863.98 --> 2868.02
on Earth dearly but i s my soul has

2866.68 --> 2871.2999999999997
suffered

2868.02 --> 2873.7599999999998
mental level emotional level physical

2871.3 --> 2874.7200000000003
level any level okay it doesn't have to

2873.76 --> 2876.76
be

2874.72 --> 2879.2799999999997
I mean all levels like there are

2876.76 --> 2880.42
different levels to a being so all those

2879.28 --> 2881.98
things happen at different levels and

2880.42 --> 2883.54
once they happen at other levels they

2881.98 --> 2885.88
can finally come into physical level two

2883.54 --> 2887.98
so one experience is that on a physical

2885.88 --> 2891.04
level two once it starts on mental or

2887.98 --> 2892.7400000000002
emotional level yeah so that's it start

2891.04 --> 2895.66
somewhere for sure

2892.74 --> 2897.9399999999996
that's it and uh

2895.66 --> 2899.7999999999997
yeah you go with uh very clear the

2897.94 --> 2902.619
within the first and send to those that

2899.8 --> 2905.02
are on this honesty very important also

2902.619 --> 2907.9
in the process but we gonna come back

2905.02 --> 2910.359
there's a old page on it Bliss okay

2907.9 --> 2911.92
people ask what is bliss because we

2910.359 --> 2914.44
gotta go through this booklet so I

2911.92 --> 2917.14
wonder also uh not spend there 25

2914.44 --> 2920.26
minutes on one page because we're like

2917.14 --> 2923.44
never gonna end this thing people ask

2920.26 --> 2925.599
what is bliss bliss is DNA on fire going

2923.44 --> 2929.02
past speed of light

2925.599 --> 2930.88
Bliss is kundalin in this I heard this

2929.02 --> 2933.16
speed of light I heard this and the

2930.88 --> 2935.2000000000003
reggae song the other day and that's

2933.16 --> 2937.66
exactly what they were saying and I was

2935.2 --> 2939.64
so impressed I was like I had to play it

2937.66 --> 2942.2799999999997
on the radio you know I that's what I

2939.64 --> 2944.56
look for uh lyrics that you know people

2942.28 --> 2946.9
say that that kind of stuff and that's

2944.56 --> 2949.119
what you were saying in the in the thing

2946.9 --> 2951.2200000000003
in the in the song that it we have to

2949.119 --> 2953.7400000000002
put ourselves past the speed of light

2951.22 --> 2957.4599999999996
and I was like wow that's powerful I saw

2953.74 --> 2959.74
that in PT's book yes so Bliss is going

2957.46 --> 2962.92
through the crown chakra

2959.74 --> 2966.8799999999997
Bliss is all the chakras flowering like

2962.92 --> 2968.56
lotuses Bliss is ability to steer one

2966.88 --> 2971.579
Souls after death

2968.56 --> 2975.22
Bliss is creating a rainbow at will

2971.579 --> 2978.579
Bliss is the brain on ecstasy through

2975.22 --> 2982.56
Kundalini juices I love that one Bliss

2978.579 --> 2985.3590000000004
is surfing time without ever falling

2982.56 --> 2988.54
Bliss is to have one's Faith completely

2985.359 --> 2991.42
in one's own hand Bliss is the ability

2988.54 --> 2994.119
to play with the elements

2991.42 --> 2996.78
this is just a little taste of bliss it

2994.119 --> 3000.1800000000003
is many more such things which most

2996.78 --> 3003.0
cannot even fathom and the one that I

3000.18 --> 3005.339
like like you said blisses the brain on

3003.0 --> 3007.68
ecstasy through Kundalini juices and

3005.339 --> 3009.9
that makes a lot of sense because if we

3007.68 --> 3012.06
are tree of life we have some kind of

3009.9 --> 3013.7400000000002
sap inside that needs to ascend just

3012.06 --> 3016.319
like a tree you know we are electric

3013.74 --> 3017.8799999999997
also like I was thinking about that the

3016.319 --> 3019.98
electric part of ourselves or I'll come

3017.88 --> 3022.079
back to this but yeah the Kundalini

3019.98 --> 3023.76
juice I send the juices I send the sap

3022.079 --> 3026.1600000000003
within yourself maybe that's what

3023.76 --> 3027.96
happened to me yeah I mean then that's

3026.16 --> 3030.2999999999997
uh like that's the whole thing of the

3027.96 --> 3032.579
glands like all the pituitary gland and

3030.3 --> 3034.92
the all the glands we have like the from

3032.579 --> 3037.079
the throat to the pineal and uh

3034.92 --> 3039.119
pituitary pineal complex all of that is

3037.079 --> 3040.26
for secreting those things but um which

3039.119 --> 3042.54
will not happen for most people because

3040.26 --> 3045.6800000000003
they don't have the uh like neither the

3042.54 --> 3048.42
body the diet or the Purity to actually

3045.68 --> 3051.18
experience that you know like so like

3048.42 --> 3053.4
that that that's because people are just

3051.18 --> 3056.94
not taking care of the basics you know

3053.4 --> 3059.1600000000003
and whatever this world is there like is

3056.94 --> 3063.359
to actually take people away from that

3059.16 --> 3065.339
purity of being or that you know so that

3063.359 --> 3067.44
people don't actually

3065.339 --> 3069.119
get to experience these things and once

3067.44 --> 3070.8
you are in a rebellion with Divine okay

3069.119 --> 3073.7400000000002
there is no question of experiencing

3070.8 --> 3076.1400000000003
Bliss I mean there is no I mean like

3073.74 --> 3078.2999999999997
that that is that goes without saying

3076.14 --> 3081.359
only when you turn the road other side

3078.3 --> 3083.88
and you actually go towards the like

3081.359 --> 3084.96
going for the Divine from Rebellion to

3083.88 --> 3088.26
Divine then only you will start

3084.96 --> 3090.9
experiencing some parts of it you know

3088.26 --> 3094.079
so like even like connecting with nature

3090.9 --> 3096.48
is also like the starting point for like

3094.079 --> 3098.88
having some of that going within your

3096.48 --> 3100.98
being you know if we talk about the

3098.88 --> 3104.88
Kundalini juices and all that stuff and

3100.98 --> 3107.579
the sap ascending and and that uh yeah

3104.88 --> 3110.46
that's it the sap needs to ascend but

3107.579 --> 3113.6400000000003
the pine tree if I why do they take the

3110.46 --> 3115.319
the like the pineal gland pine cone like

3113.64 --> 3117.96
if you can find a pine cone in the

3115.319 --> 3119.4
vatscan yard like the pine tree seems

3117.96 --> 3121.68
very significant because there is a

3119.4 --> 3124.38
manyata muscaria mushroom after growing

3121.68 --> 3128.22
under because that's the shape hold down

3124.38 --> 3131.28
in the pine three always leaks a lot of

3128.22 --> 3133.2599999999998
like gummy stuff look yes like it's

3131.28 --> 3134.4
probably the tree that leaks the most

3133.26 --> 3136.6800000000003
like you don't want to touch them

3134.4 --> 3139.26
because you think your finger gets all

3136.68 --> 3140.7
stuck yes yes because that's the shape

3139.26 --> 3143.28
of the pinion gland

3140.7 --> 3145.3799999999997
shape pine cone shape is the shape of

3143.28 --> 3148.02
the pineal gland that is the exact shape

3145.38 --> 3149.94
of the pineal gland and it is a fractal

3148.02 --> 3152.64
shape again in the way that things

3149.94 --> 3154.68
arrange enough it's in a five ratio only

3152.64 --> 3156.7799999999997
and that is the actual shape of the

3154.68 --> 3159.839
penal gland so that's why it gets this

3156.78 --> 3161.7000000000003
importance you know so like and that

3159.839 --> 3163.0789999999997
that's where the like if the colony

3161.7 --> 3165.24
reaches the pineal gland then that's

3163.079 --> 3167.52
called the third eye opening you know so

3165.24 --> 3169.2
so that is the thing which is called

3167.52 --> 3172.079
that but I mean that is very tertiary

3169.2 --> 3174.66
stuff most people cannot even that thing

3172.079 --> 3177.119
that that level is not for people like

3174.66 --> 3179.0989999999997
not for people just getting some Basics

3177.119 --> 3181.02
like connecting with nature or like

3179.099 --> 3184.26
getting some control of their own body

3181.02 --> 3186.72
and diet and being is a very very

3184.26 --> 3189.78
starting point you know those are very

3186.72 --> 3191.0989999999997
tertiary level things which uh like

3189.78 --> 3193.2000000000003
that's why I don't go into detail about

3191.099 --> 3195.0
those kind of things because it'll not

3193.2 --> 3197.339
benefit people in any way shape or form

3195.0 --> 3200.4
actually from what the state they are in

3197.339 --> 3203.22
even like like intellectually knowing

3200.4 --> 3206.64
about those things will not help them in

3203.22 --> 3208.5
any way to actually get there so no

3206.64 --> 3211.3799999999997
because it's like you take a shortcut to

3208.5 --> 3214.26
get there so there's no chance of

3211.38 --> 3216.2400000000002
awareness yes step by step day-to-day

3214.26 --> 3218.099
process without stress don't stress

3216.24 --> 3220.5589999999997
yourself like I don't come here talk to

3218.099 --> 3222.119
you about oh I'm talking about the basic

3220.559 --> 3224.1600000000003
stuff because I know I have to relearn

3222.119 --> 3226.02
how to live lit simple yeah yeah yeah

3224.16 --> 3227.819
and uh that the whole thing is against

3226.02 --> 3230.339
Liberty obviously like the whole thing

3227.819 --> 3232.819
is the whole system is to make people

3230.339 --> 3234.839
more impure like right like like

3232.819 --> 3237.18
everything in the society and everything

3234.839 --> 3239.94
is to make people not pure like it is to

3237.18 --> 3242.64
make them impure because I mean impurity

3239.94 --> 3246.119
means like um you are aligning with the

3242.64 --> 3249.2999999999997
Mind rather than going against the

3246.119 --> 3252.059
Divine so that's yeah yeah here you say

3249.3 --> 3254.579
no pill alcohol drink drugs relationship

3252.059 --> 3257.099
self-guided diet main station or yoga

3254.579 --> 3258.96
can give it that's very true only way is

3257.099 --> 3262.8590000000004
learning learning from those who have it

3258.96 --> 3264.7200000000003
by bowing and serving yes because the

3262.859 --> 3267.119
thing is because it's an attitude thing

3264.72 --> 3269.52
isn't it like finally like everything is

3267.119 --> 3270.6600000000003
an attitude right like if you don't have

3269.52 --> 3272.4
a right attitude like if you have

3270.66 --> 3274.68
attitude of rebellion against Divine for

3272.4 --> 3276.48
example that is your basic attitude then

3274.68 --> 3279.359
what you eat and what that thing after

3276.48 --> 3282.48
that that will even not help you because

3279.359 --> 3284.7
your general attitude is of against that

3282.48 --> 3286.079
thing so like main thing comes to the

3284.7 --> 3287.2799999999997
attitude thing like you have to change

3286.079 --> 3289.8
your attitude

3287.28 --> 3291.2400000000002
at a core level like so like like they

3289.8 --> 3292.6800000000003
say there are two paths you can go by

3291.24 --> 3294.8999999999996
you know the two paths are this only

3292.68 --> 3297.54
either you can Rebel

3294.9 --> 3300.3
or against Divine or you can align with

3297.54 --> 3303.0589999999997
it okay there is that those are the two

3300.3 --> 3305.7000000000003
paths like there is no third

3303.059 --> 3308.46
path like you know and again we have

3305.7 --> 3311.0589999999997
tendency to kind of believe that if we

3308.46 --> 3313.7400000000002
align with Divine we got to be perfect

3311.059 --> 3316.3390000000004
no nothing like that okay can you put

3313.74 --> 3319.4399999999996
some clarity into this because

3316.339 --> 3321.24
starting psychological process where you

3319.44 --> 3323.339
say like okay

3321.24 --> 3325.7999999999997
whatever the laws are in this Divine

3323.339 --> 3328.98
laws in this Multiverse in this universe

3325.8 --> 3330.78
which I'm in okay I align with them okay

3328.98 --> 3332.16
I want to align with them I don't want

3330.78 --> 3334.1400000000003
to

3332.16 --> 3336.0589999999997
that thing go again you don't want to

3334.14 --> 3337.98
praise evil anymore yeah yeah you you

3336.059 --> 3340.1400000000003
you don't you don't want to go against

3337.98 --> 3342.0
that so that is a psychological process

3340.14 --> 3343.6189999999997
and okay like going into nature and

3342.0 --> 3345.54
stuff helps with that you know like if

3343.619 --> 3348.9
you go to Nature and stuff like it helps

3345.54 --> 3350.579
with aligning with Divine much more than

3348.9 --> 3351.96
those people who don't do that like

3350.579 --> 3354.599
you've been sitting in front of the TV

3351.96 --> 3357.18
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so appreciation

3354.599 --> 3359.2200000000003
of nature automatically puts you in the

3357.18 --> 3361.6189999999997
right frame of mind

3359.22 --> 3364.02
to actually

3361.619 --> 3365.94
align with the vine or align with that

3364.02 --> 3368.88
thing because again nature leads to

3365.94 --> 3370.859
Divine only so but still like one has to

3368.88 --> 3373.1400000000003
but like some people think that they are

3370.859 --> 3374.64
appreciating nature uh but then they

3373.14 --> 3376.6189999999997
want to stop there they don't want to go

3374.64 --> 3378.74
further than that you know they stay in

3376.619 --> 3381.599
their car yeah yeah

3378.74 --> 3383.2799999999997
that's the funny thing you see now I I

3381.599 --> 3384.839
watch videos sometimes people going in

3383.28 --> 3386.52
the states and the desert and all that

3384.839 --> 3389.04
but they go with their car and they stay

3386.52 --> 3391.619
in the car like the idea of people go

3389.04 --> 3393.24
going out these days is a lot with their

3391.619 --> 3394.1400000000003
car and staying in their car it's kind

3393.24 --> 3395.819
of weird

3394.14 --> 3397.5
yeah I mean it's not just about I mean

3395.819 --> 3399.0
even if they walk out there like like a

3397.5 --> 3401.7
lot of people walk and stuff but then

3399.0 --> 3404.16
they walk in a way which is uh gonna be

3401.7 --> 3405.4199999999996
taxing for them so they'll be walking so

3404.16 --> 3406.5
many miles they'll be so tired and

3405.42 --> 3408.48
they'll have that thing oh they have to

3406.5 --> 3411.059
walk seven miles today 10 miles tomorrow

3408.48 --> 3413.88
like you know like so they have these

3411.059 --> 3415.559
goals like that and which it takes away

3413.88 --> 3417.9
from all appreciation of nature you know

3415.559 --> 3420.6600000000003
like so so I mean it's either that or

3417.9 --> 3422.7000000000003
that like it is never in Balance nothing

3420.66 --> 3424.859
is done in Balance obviously and that is

3422.7 --> 3427.6189999999997
obviously because the the whole attitude

3424.859 --> 3430.38
and mentality is stuck that way nothing

3427.619 --> 3433.619
is done in Balance like so but if the pH

3430.38 --> 3436.319
first of all if your pH is not balanced

3433.619 --> 3438.54
everything goes absolutely the fog start

3436.319 --> 3440.88
creating in there and you have a very

3438.54 --> 3443.88
foggy brain and like every I don't know

3440.88 --> 3445.92
me I felt a bit like that before but

3443.88 --> 3447.78
that's exactly why I say like everything

3445.92 --> 3449.88
has to start with the one's own uh

3447.78 --> 3451.1400000000003
posture and body like if you take

3449.88 --> 3454.6800000000003
control of your posture and your body

3451.14 --> 3457.44
like just that basic thing that's good

3454.68 --> 3459.72
enough to start like so and the

3457.44 --> 3461.52
centering for that like that is what I

3459.72 --> 3464.0989999999997
say is the beginning point

3461.52 --> 3468.18
to uh for any being

3464.099 --> 3472.44
to like get a more like Clarity in this

3468.18 --> 3474.48
sort of uh crazy mess which is or insane

3472.44 --> 3477.18
mess which is around them yeah in the

3474.48 --> 3478.68
Muggle world like you say so we gotta

3477.18 --> 3480.839
finish this session with truth okay

3478.68 --> 3484.46
because we say we're gonna make them an

3480.839 --> 3487.92
hour or so each truth is the most

3484.46 --> 3490.5
misunderstood term in muggle well I like

3487.92 --> 3492.0
when you say that it is usually equated

3490.5 --> 3494.099
with being accurate about how many

3492.0 --> 3497.579
toffees one eight or how many apples

3494.099 --> 3500.819
once told how much tax one avoided the

3497.579 --> 3503.599
unending information on forms or such or

3500.819 --> 3508.339
other such useless pity trivia

3503.599 --> 3510.7200000000003
meant for upholding the Unholy system

3508.339 --> 3513.66
now it's important it's not Krishna it's

3510.72 --> 3515.64
Krishna always denied eating the butter

3513.66 --> 3518.2799999999997
would be considered a lie under current

3515.64 --> 3519.66
definitions which people like Gandhi

3518.28 --> 3524.599
have propagated

3519.66 --> 3527.5789999999997
real truth as in satyam Shivan

3524.599 --> 3530.2200000000003
sundaram I think I say good meaning

3527.579 --> 3531.599
truth is shiv is beauty I like this I

3530.22 --> 3533.9399999999996
like this because I'm gonna tell you

3531.599 --> 3535.8590000000004
something hold on it has nothing to do

3533.94 --> 3538.44
with anything to do with this

3535.859 --> 3541.38
artificially created Society instructor

3538.44 --> 3543.48
and its battle matters real truth has

3541.38 --> 3546.96
more to do with seeing reality as is

3543.48 --> 3549.72
without any Distortion truth is facing

3546.96 --> 3551.7
the reality of One's Own being and the

3549.72 --> 3555.66
lack of Happiness they're in

3551.7 --> 3558.54
therein truth is in the laws of nature

3555.66 --> 3562.2
and divine which are pure scientifically

3558.54 --> 3564.7799999999997
verificable principles not subject to

3562.2 --> 3566.16
change in time truth is that Divine

3564.78 --> 3569.2200000000003
exists

3566.16 --> 3573.359
truth is that happiness can only exist

3569.22 --> 3576.0589999999997
exist where when Divine is praised yes

3573.359 --> 3577.859
and what really got to me is that truth

3576.059 --> 3580.6800000000003
is shiv is beauty because you know

3577.859 --> 3583.02
what's the truth I say often the truth

3580.68 --> 3584.819
is experience the truth is the beauty

3583.02 --> 3587.7
within you

3584.819 --> 3589.079
yes the beauty part of you what do you

3587.7 --> 3591.5989999999997
think about that that's what you're

3589.079 --> 3594.7200000000003
saying yeah I mean uh the thing is that

3591.599 --> 3596.339
this is uh like a Sanskrit shlok from

3594.72 --> 3598.74
the that things and shiv is a being

3596.339 --> 3600.66
which is open his third eye okay so and

3598.74 --> 3603.839
he's in that Bliss State okay that is

3600.66 --> 3605.0989999999997
called state of swiftness which it's

3603.839 --> 3607.02
nothing to do with marijuana or anything

3605.099 --> 3610.079
like that now right now they show shiv

3607.02 --> 3611.7
smoking bongs and stuff in the west you

3610.079 --> 3614.1600000000003
know like it's nothing to do with that

3611.7 --> 3615.8999999999996
uh it's to do with actual truth and uh

3614.16 --> 3617.7599999999998
reality and facing reality you know so

3615.9 --> 3619.14
once during that then you get to beauty

3617.76 --> 3621.78
of any kind of beauty you know like

3619.14 --> 3623.52
whatever beauty is and beauty is not a

3621.78 --> 3627.6600000000003
subjective thing which people think it

3623.52 --> 3629.339
is it's an absolute thing actually so so

3627.66 --> 3632.7
beauty is an absolute thing and it is

3629.339 --> 3635.339
reached by uh actually practicing that

3632.7 --> 3637.6189999999997
truth which is the pure principles the

3635.339 --> 3641.16
multiples of laws the Divine qualities

3637.619 --> 3644.339
and actually uh finding about them

3641.16 --> 3646.74
actually praising them through praising

3644.339 --> 3649.5589999999997
inculating them and then practicing them

3646.74 --> 3651.18
so that is how duty is gained and beauty

3649.559 --> 3655.5
is the goal of a lot of beings

3651.18 --> 3658.319
on in this world or any and if they want

3655.5 --> 3660.78
that they'll have to go towards truth

3658.319 --> 3662.22
there's no other way I I mean otherwise

3660.78 --> 3664.5
all this plastic surgery and everything

3662.22 --> 3666.359
is not gonna give you any kind of

3664.5 --> 3668.64
anything you know like whether on a

3666.359 --> 3670.14
physical level or a internal level it's

3668.64 --> 3672.839
not gonna give you

3670.14 --> 3674.7
that so truth is the only thing which

3672.839 --> 3678.0
leads to Beauty actually like so that's

3674.7 --> 3681.72
why that connection between truth and um

3678.0 --> 3684.059
third eye and Beauty and the whole thing

3681.72 --> 3687.359
you know like divinity so and everything

3684.059 --> 3689.88
becomes natural also like uh in I don't

3687.359 --> 3691.68
know if I ever think that beauty within

3689.88 --> 3693.839
me to me I'm not a I don't know I don't

3691.68 --> 3696.4199999999996
like to pretend or to say I'm there

3693.839 --> 3698.88
there like I'm evolving I'm evolving I

3696.42 --> 3699.98
have a deep desire to evolve but uh yes

3698.88 --> 3702.839
yes

3699.98 --> 3705.54
I'm just doing my thing I'm trying to

3702.839 --> 3708.0
clear the trauma most of it and get to

3705.54 --> 3710.04
the truth within my being which is I

3708.0 --> 3712.079
think the beauty with it obviously like

3710.04 --> 3713.64
like even if anybody's after the truth

3712.079 --> 3715.6800000000003
then that's the right thing to do in

3713.64 --> 3720.0
this world and but that is the real

3715.68 --> 3721.799
truth reality not just uh something like

3720.0 --> 3723.18
here and there whatever like fake thing

3721.799 --> 3726.0
which is going on in this world right

3723.18 --> 3728.339
now in the name of Truth like so so that

3726.0 --> 3731.94
is yeah that's a that's an important

3728.339 --> 3734.04
point there I can say why also we we are

3731.94 --> 3736.079
not facing reality outside of ourselves

3734.04 --> 3739.079
because we don't face the reality of our

3736.079 --> 3741.2400000000002
own being like you say the LIE starts by

3739.079 --> 3743.3390000000004
I think it's you that say that the LIE

3741.24 --> 3745.5
starts by the moment you pretend to know

3743.339 --> 3748.14
how to live and then all the rest is

3745.5 --> 3750.18
alive yes yes yes yes because you

3748.14 --> 3751.74
actually don't that's the fact the fact

3750.18 --> 3753.5989999999997
is you don't the fact is you don't know

3751.74 --> 3755.339
you have no clue you have no clue you

3753.599 --> 3756.54
have no idea like what to do with the

3755.339 --> 3758.88
human body or

3756.54 --> 3760.92
like that that's a fact that's that's

3758.88 --> 3764.7000000000003
just a fact like you know you know we

3760.92 --> 3768.1800000000003
don't even know our body that that's so

3764.7 --> 3770.7
like we're given the most advanced

3768.18 --> 3773.46
technology you can ever have is your

3770.7 --> 3776.0989999999997
body you know and we're not even aware

3773.46 --> 3778.26
of what's in it how it function how to

3776.099 --> 3780.48
get it into alignment how to prevent

3778.26 --> 3783.0
disease how to we just let everything

3780.48 --> 3785.94
happen this is happen torture pain we

3783.0 --> 3787.28
take it and it's like ah bring it on the

3785.94 --> 3790.5
store is open

3787.28 --> 3792.0
I mean yeah I mean that's like being a

3790.5 --> 3796.28
soldier in the dribble into Divine you

3792.0 --> 3799.319
know like a brave Soldier yeah like like

3796.28 --> 3801.119
so I mean um I mean that kind of Bravery

3799.319 --> 3802.38
is like it can be called bravery or it

3801.119 --> 3805.02
can be called foolishness whatever you

3802.38 --> 3807.0
want to call it like you know so yeah so

3805.02 --> 3809.4
yeah that's what I think it's you say

3807.0 --> 3812.099
we're very foolish we're not selfish

3809.4 --> 3814.619
we're very foolish yes it's like a

3812.099 --> 3817.26
circus out there there is Circus but

3814.619 --> 3820.799
it's like a real circus with that yeah a

3817.26 --> 3822.78
lot of fools yes yes yes yes and uh the

3820.799 --> 3825.42
the first step very first step to

3822.78 --> 3827.4
everything actually is like knowing your

3825.42 --> 3829.859
level and state and being honest about

3827.4 --> 3832.38
it and like saying okay I don't know

3829.859 --> 3836.66
then I will learn okay because you don't

3832.38 --> 3836.6600000000003
know then you'll learn okay that is the

3841.04 --> 3846.839
deeply up into a system I know it

3843.96 --> 3849.119
I know I have to undo this I have to to

3846.839 --> 3852.14
realign myself because and I think we're

3849.119 --> 3854.94
all deeply up it's the experience

3852.14 --> 3855.9
but the fact that like okay you can't

3854.94 --> 3857.46
even there's nothing to do with the

3855.9 --> 3859.14
system even the fact that you don't know

3857.46 --> 3861.599
how to live or what to do with the body

3859.14 --> 3863.46
it's just because uh system is just not

3861.599 --> 3864.96
teaching you but there can be a system

3863.46 --> 3866.76
it doesn't eat you but that doesn't mean

3864.96 --> 3869.819
that you cannot learn

3866.76 --> 3873.2990000000004
yourself you know like yeah yeah I mean

3869.819 --> 3875.579
that's uh that's not the end condition

3873.299 --> 3878.22
some system has to teach you that like

3875.579 --> 3881.28
so yeah so yeah this is harder to learn

3878.22 --> 3884.22
to evolve and yeah and I don't need

3881.28 --> 3886.5
nobody to knock on my door and to like

3884.22 --> 3889.02
give you that fire it's with the natural

3886.5 --> 3891.66
I have this naturally and I want more

3889.02 --> 3894.059
and more of it more consistency okay

3891.66 --> 3896.52
again truth you talk about truth number

3894.059 --> 3899.28
one ingredient and Truth consistency

3896.52 --> 3902.099
right yes by coherence consistency

3899.28 --> 3904.2000000000003
consistency is part of quorums it's part

3902.099 --> 3906.78
of quorums that word we talked earlier

3904.2 --> 3909.24
that is part of that will the because I

3906.78 --> 3911.52
think the consistency will bring you to

3909.24 --> 3914.0989999999997
a more coherent state right yes yes

3911.52 --> 3915.72
obviously yes obviously yes so I'm doing

3914.099 --> 3918.079
the right thing I'm being consistent and

3915.72 --> 3918.0789999999997
my stuff

3919.88 --> 3924.48
inconsistent then obviously coherence is

3922.14 --> 3926.9
gone okay perfect is not possible okay

3924.48 --> 3929.04
okay so okay all right

3926.9 --> 3931.6800000000003
that is enough for people I think for

3929.04 --> 3935.04
one hour like the amount of attention

3931.68 --> 3936.839
span people have so you know wow yeah so

3935.04 --> 3939.0589999999997
uh thank you very much prashanto we'll

3936.839 --> 3942.0789999999997
do it again next Wednesday you're still

3939.059 --> 3944.88
available yeah yes yes okay perfect

3942.079 --> 3947.1600000000003
like I say my goal is to go through the

3944.88 --> 3949.559
whole book because I think it it's good

3947.16 --> 3952.319
to read it's good to like write it but

3949.559 --> 3954.599
coming with you the the author of the

3952.319 --> 3956.7
book and they give him some more clarity

3954.599 --> 3958.92
it's everybody will benefit from Disney

3956.7 --> 3961.319
okay and I think that's what you want

3958.92 --> 3963.48
people to benefit from your book like I

3961.319 --> 3965.7
don't feel you're in this for money or

3963.48 --> 3968.579
something like that if it becomes the

3965.7 --> 3970.799
byproduct of your of your success or you

3968.579 --> 3974.04
take it but I think you want people to

3970.799 --> 3975.599
get clarity like we're yeah we're in

3974.04 --> 3978.0589999999997
this for for the benefit of us all

3975.599 --> 3979.7400000000002
lyrics clearly these are the things of

3978.059 --> 3981.599
that these days books and stuff like in

3979.74 --> 3984.24
the waiting time there was no books it

3981.599 --> 3986.2200000000003
was all by speech and listening uh so I

3984.24 --> 3988.799
mean these are just forms which these

3986.22 --> 3991.319
days people have uh I want to use and

3988.799 --> 3994.2599999999998
stuff like I'm not very interested in it

3991.319 --> 3996.18
um myself like uh the whole uh actual

3994.26 --> 3999.1800000000003
learning and teaching happens from mouth

3996.18 --> 4001.22
and listening in you know so so that was

3999.18 --> 4003.0789999999997
The Vedic way so which is actually

4001.22 --> 4005.5389999999998
listening but it takes courage to listen

4003.079 --> 4007.1600000000003
and some people lack courage they lack

4005.539 --> 4010.039
that it takes a lot of courage to listen

4007.16 --> 4012.92
yeah as much as to speak I need your

4010.039 --> 4015.26
agent to speak but even the 25 of use

4012.92 --> 4017.599
listening you need courage to listen to

4015.26 --> 4020.0
us because we're going to the core of

4017.599 --> 4022.52
the our existence also and I think it's

4020.0 --> 4024.619
the the the meaning of life you know

4022.52 --> 4027.2
gets your life some kind of meaning it

4024.619 --> 4029.359
comes with responsibility that's all the

4027.2 --> 4031.0989999999997
respect you you take responsibility your

4029.359 --> 4033.0789999999997
life will suddenly have a great great

4031.099 --> 4035.059
meaning and it's not only a

4033.079 --> 4036.8590000000004
responsibility we're gonna come to that

4035.059 --> 4039.2000000000003
