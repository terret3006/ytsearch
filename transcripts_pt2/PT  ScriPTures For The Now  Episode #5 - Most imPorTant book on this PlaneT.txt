0.12 --> 5.58
or that thing we can concentrate like

2.1 --> 8.519
yes that's it we are on live and direct

5.58 --> 11.34
here that's what it says with my great

8.519 --> 14.099
brother prashanti how are you I'm fine

11.34 --> 17.22
yes everything is good like fine with

14.099 --> 18.84
the Phi yes it's good to see you back

17.22 --> 20.4
it's good to see you back that's what I

18.84 --> 21.92
said before now we're gonna go again

20.4 --> 25.278999999999996
with the

21.92 --> 28.560000000000002
scriptures for the now the books yes

25.279 --> 31.198999999999998
and we were uh like I don't want to

28.56 --> 32.64
waste time I think Humanity has wasted

31.199 --> 35.399
enough time

32.64 --> 37.68
so we're gonna dive deep in it right

35.399 --> 39.120000000000005
away and then the root cause we're gonna

37.68 --> 40.92
start with the root cause that's where

39.12 --> 43.379
we were and I think that's something

40.92 --> 46.68
that's evident there is a root cause for

43.379 --> 50.039
the the madness here yes but I think

46.68 --> 52.98
it's our ability to see the cars

50.039 --> 56.1
because the cars it's me

52.98 --> 59.398999999999994
yes it's us because and you know it it

56.1 --> 62.64
involves looking at ourselves to see the

59.399 --> 65.64
root cause so am I wrong by saying that

62.64 --> 67.799
we should really have a great look a

65.64 --> 69.18
great introspection into ourselves to

67.799 --> 71.4
see that through cast because that's

69.18 --> 72.72000000000001
what you say here is when we pretend to

71.4 --> 75.659
know how to live

72.72 --> 77.7
yes I mean I think a pretension in any

75.659 --> 79.02000000000001
which way will not help anybody you know

77.7 --> 81.36
because if you pretend something you're

79.02 --> 82.79899999999999
just uh like fooling yourself basically

81.36 --> 83.88
in the end like instead of fooling

82.799 --> 84.9
others people think they're fooling

83.88 --> 87.29899999999999
others

84.9 --> 89.10000000000001
when they do it but actually you are

87.299 --> 90.06
fooling yourself you know because the

89.1 --> 91.439
thing is that if you don't know

90.06 --> 93.78
something you don't know

91.439 --> 96.24
so just just be clear and say no I don't

93.78 --> 98.04
know okay it's a very simple thing uh to

96.24 --> 99.78
say I don't know but it doesn't come so

98.04 --> 101.46000000000001
naturally or easily for anybody like you

99.78 --> 103.259
know people still want to pretend to

101.46 --> 106.19999999999999
like um look like they know something

103.259 --> 108.299
when they don't know and that's the

106.2 --> 110.22
that's a very very root cause of any

108.299 --> 112.2
kind of situation and problem we have

110.22 --> 114.17999999999999
out here like you know like it's a you

112.2 --> 116.159
know you know why it's not because we

114.18 --> 119.22000000000001
don't learn we're not in action or stuff

116.159 --> 120.659
like that we learn but I found that I

119.22 --> 123.96
found a quote yesterday that was

120.659 --> 128.34
resuming it so well is I think I learned

123.96 --> 131.459
to die not to live you know we learned

128.34 --> 133.739
to die not to live we don't learn to

131.459 --> 136.8
live like you say we don't know how to

133.739 --> 140.22
live really uh and it goes deeper you

136.8 --> 142.02
can extend on all the our our misery and

140.22 --> 143.64
stuff Lube I mean even uh learning to

142.02 --> 146.81900000000002
die is also learning like what happens

143.64 --> 148.85999999999999
how to die successfully you know to make

146.819 --> 151.379
sure that you get out the Matrix or how

148.86 --> 154.26000000000002
to actually die properly also is also

151.379 --> 156.48
are learning just like yeah but I mean

154.26 --> 157.98
learning dying alive I was talking about

156.48 --> 159.72
yeah I know I know what you're talking

157.98 --> 161.459
about you're talking about like uh like

159.72 --> 164.04
when you're just actually wasting your

161.459 --> 165.3
life yeah and not living and the wasting

164.04 --> 168.29999999999998
of like that is the dying of another

165.3 --> 171.239
type when you're wasting something you

168.3 --> 174.36
know so that that waste is another kind

171.239 --> 176.81900000000002
of dying yes but I think uh mostly uh

174.36 --> 179.519
people do not accept the fact that they

176.819 --> 182.64
don't know okay like like it's like a

179.519 --> 184.44
boat in the middle of ocean you know and

182.64 --> 186.42
you don't have any Compass you don't

184.44 --> 189.06
have any you don't know where you're

186.42 --> 190.379
going You're just that thing on that

189.06 --> 192.18
ocean and you don't know where to go

190.379 --> 193.5
what to do you know that is what the

192.18 --> 195.36
situation is

193.5 --> 199.08
and on top of that that boat is leaking

195.36 --> 201.48000000000002
as well like you know yeah so so it's

199.08 --> 203.519
it's that kind of imagery you know what

201.48 --> 205.73899999999998
people are in and it's only comes to

203.519 --> 206.81900000000002
like a people should not pretend to know

205.739 --> 209.09900000000002
what

206.819 --> 210.72
to do I mean because in the end if they

209.099 --> 213.48
do using that pretension or like that

210.72 --> 214.68
false knowing you know then they'll land

213.48 --> 216.23899999999998
up in trouble for themselves they'll

214.68 --> 217.98000000000002
make more trouble for themselves that's

216.239 --> 221.04
all that is going to happen from that

217.98 --> 222.959
nothing else so yeah I see that also

221.04 --> 225.12
like you say learning how to navigate

222.959 --> 226.799
and those troubled waters you know it's

225.12 --> 228.72
like we all have a ship we should take

226.799 --> 231.9
ownership of our life we all have a ship

228.72 --> 235.2
I am a ship you are a great captain of a

231.9 --> 237.72
great ship know that yeah I am a maybe a

235.2 --> 239.94
like a live boat in there or something

237.72 --> 240.84
but I am a ship that's for sure yeah I

239.94 --> 243.2
mean everybody

240.84 --> 246.12
uh so they have to take responsibility

243.2 --> 249.35999999999999
and they have to like uh say like okay I

246.12 --> 251.459
don't know but I will learn okay because

249.36 --> 253.799
if you don't say you don't know then you

251.459 --> 255.48
can't learn because it's all you already

253.799 --> 258.54
know and if you already know then what's

255.48 --> 259.739
the point of learning anything anyways I

258.54 --> 261.66
mean you know what to do with your life

259.739 --> 264.479
if you know what to do how to live from

261.66 --> 266.699
morning waking up to night going to

264.479 --> 268.62
sleep or night waking up or morning

266.699 --> 270.38
going to sleep whatever way you do it

268.62 --> 273.0
but if you don't

270.38 --> 275.15999999999997
know how to actually what to do with the

273.0 --> 277.5
human body or what you do what to do

275.16 --> 279.3
with your time then you are in for

277.5 --> 281.52
trouble basically and that should be the

279.3 --> 283.8
basic that thing of learning Any Which

281.52 --> 285.479
Way for anyone like I mean that's should

283.8 --> 286.91900000000004
be the whole thing you know like but we

285.479 --> 288.479
don't we don't have that we have schools

286.919 --> 292.38
and all this kind of stuff which doesn't

288.479 --> 294.3
tell you anything you know like so you

292.38 --> 296.639
know they didn't tell me in school that

294.3 --> 299.1
I had to raise myself to catch the wind

296.639 --> 301.919
of the Divine you know and I wasn't told

299.1 --> 303.84000000000003
stuff like that but today I know that I

301.919 --> 305.75899999999996
have to learn how to navigate in those

303.84 --> 308.52
water and that's why I have people like

305.759 --> 310.97900000000004
you yeah you know to teach me how to

308.52 --> 313.19899999999996
take the captain wheel and navigate and

310.979 --> 315.199
we can all at one point lead our ship

313.199 --> 317.22
and yeah

315.199 --> 319.8
one has to be become people have to

317.22 --> 322.02000000000004
become honest you know honestly yeah

319.8 --> 324.3
honest I mean that's why and that's why

322.02 --> 325.68
because another thing with uh people is

324.3 --> 328.5
that they are not honest enough about

325.68 --> 330.36
these things and that uh what what they

328.5 --> 332.34
know and not know you know it's it's

330.36 --> 334.56
just uh that thing where it's about

332.34 --> 337.56
showing others it's about others so I

334.56 --> 340.62
have to give this image to others rather

337.56 --> 341.4
than actually working on oneself you

340.62 --> 343.68
know

341.4 --> 345.17999999999995
like it becomes more about an image

343.68 --> 348.36
to other people

345.18 --> 350.1
yeah yeah I mean I mean that's why I

348.36 --> 351.66
mean I am very surprised when people do

350.1 --> 352.91900000000004
any kind of thing in this world you know

351.66 --> 354.72
people get on different kind of stages

352.919 --> 356.94
people do all kinds of things in this

354.72 --> 359.88000000000005
world like I mean or they and they are

356.94 --> 361.44
very confident as well in whatever

359.88 --> 363.24
they're doing it's not like they're not

361.44 --> 364.8
they look confident about whatever

363.24 --> 366.36
they're doing and stuff like that but

364.8 --> 368.88
the reality is they don't know anything

366.36 --> 370.62
they have no idea they have no clue as

368.88 --> 373.8
to what is going on what they're doing

370.62 --> 376.68
or anything like you know so it becomes

373.8 --> 379.32
more of a like a joke of sorts you know

376.68 --> 381.18
where people who don't know but are like

379.32 --> 382.919
out there constantly doing things in

381.18 --> 385.38
front of that thing and people say it's

382.919 --> 388.02
for you know like making money or

385.38 --> 390.65999999999997
getting this or getting that or earning

388.02 --> 393.96
a living people give it various

390.66 --> 395.759
names and colors but it's the same thing

393.96 --> 397.31899999999996
where you are actually not getting to

395.759 --> 399.18
the root of the situation where you

397.319 --> 401.03900000000004
don't know how to live

399.18 --> 402.78000000000003
and then you're trying to do things on

401.039 --> 404.81899999999996
top like you know that's you know so

402.78 --> 405.84
people talk about being an artist or any

404.819 --> 408.84000000000003
of these things I said like I mean

405.84 --> 411.84
forget about art or anything just focus

408.84 --> 414.65999999999997
on like how to live like you're 12 14 16

411.84 --> 416.28
18 hours which you stay awake you know

414.66 --> 419.16
what are you gonna do in them you know

416.28 --> 420.59999999999997
like I mean uh that's I mean art and

419.16 --> 422.639
stuff is for people who actually have

420.6 --> 424.38
all of their Basics covered

422.639 --> 426.12
you know and they know what to do the

424.38 --> 428.699
basics and then you can maybe go on to

426.12 --> 431.1
the next step and do those things you

428.699 --> 433.8
know but people who have very bad Basics

431.1 --> 436.08000000000004
and nothing there and them trying to do

433.8 --> 438.66
things is it's not the right way to go

436.08 --> 440.69899999999996
about it like yes we like to take

438.66 --> 442.62
shortcuts you know and we think they're

440.699 --> 444.599
shortcuts to it I don't think there's

442.62 --> 447.24
any shortcut to the road they have a

444.599 --> 450.18
higher and divine than me I take it day

447.24 --> 452.34000000000003
by day and I desire to grow out of the

450.18 --> 455.40000000000003
nonsense also you gotta say new to the

452.34 --> 457.25899999999996
nonsense it's very important but people

455.4 --> 459.84
have to stop that thing you know just uh

457.259 --> 461.34000000000003
just because a lot of people go look at

459.84 --> 464.099
other people and other people seem

461.34 --> 465.96
confident okay so then they get a

464.099 --> 466.86
feeling like oh I should be confident

465.96 --> 469.56
too

466.86 --> 471.66
because other people are but they don't

469.56 --> 473.699
understand that sister pretensions it's

471.66 --> 477.24
not real that that confidence is not

473.699 --> 479.039
real okay it's just a act it's just it's

477.24 --> 480.84000000000003
not actually coming from actually

479.039 --> 484.139
knowing and being centered and knowing

480.84 --> 486.96
what you're doing having that clarity

484.139 --> 489.419
in what you're doing you know it is it's

486.96 --> 491.88
so so people get fooled

489.419 --> 494.58
by other people in that way and then

491.88 --> 496.08
they try to do the same thing themselves

494.58 --> 497.699
because they think that's the way to go

496.08 --> 500.69899999999996
because these other people are getting

497.699 --> 502.979
so-called success in this world by being

500.699 --> 505.68
confident like you know and so I should

502.979 --> 508.44
do the same because and that's how you

505.68 --> 509.759
will get success you know so and they

508.44 --> 512.3389999999999
don't understand that this success is

509.759 --> 514.5
not a success it's a successful which

512.339 --> 517.6800000000001
sucks you in and you go down you know

514.5 --> 520.56
it's not it's not real success of any

517.68 --> 523.62
kind it's actually a downward spiral so

520.56 --> 525.54
yeah I see I see someone successful if

523.62 --> 527.7
you reconnect to your soul if you

525.54 --> 529.62
reconnect to your being if you're true

527.7 --> 533.1600000000001
to yourself if that's the kind of

529.62 --> 535.68
success that I see but the the rest I

533.16 --> 538.5
mean it's not the goal is not to become

535.68 --> 540.42
popular or to be famous or I think

538.5 --> 543.18
because you lose a bit to yourself you

540.42 --> 545.3389999999999
want to be like a bit too much in that

543.18 --> 547.56
sense that's the first uh probably

545.339 --> 550.1400000000001
saying Rome that affects Humanities the

547.56 --> 551.76
like me syndrome we're talking about it

550.14 --> 554.04
I think at the beginning in the book I

551.76 --> 556.62
think I've put mentioned that yeah yeah

554.04 --> 559.38
we've talked about it yeah so now it

556.62 --> 561.42
goes also with the biggest crime one can

559.38 --> 564.779
commit after that's what you you come

561.42 --> 567.899
right after with and that biggest that's

564.779 --> 570.36
what we've said that like you say here

567.899 --> 572.399
it's straightforward consequence that

570.36 --> 575.04
they know what they are doing cannotes

572.399 --> 577.56
look a being who doesn't really know and

575.04 --> 580.86
acts like they know that's the thing

577.56 --> 583.8599999999999
here we yes like we know we pray so much

580.86 --> 587.339
yeah yeah yeah that has to go I mean I

583.86 --> 589.32
mean that is the basic basic core issue

587.339 --> 591.72
here it's a core issue it's a core issue

589.32 --> 593.339
it's not it's not it's the like people

591.72 --> 594.839
can say about this that thing this is

593.339 --> 597.4200000000001
wrong or that is wrong nothing else is

594.839 --> 600.36
wrong okay only this one thing is wrong

597.42 --> 601.8
okay like so like I mean it's it's not

600.36 --> 603.6
like people write books and books about

601.8 --> 605.2199999999999
psychology you know they are like 100

603.6 --> 608.0400000000001
million books on psychology you know

605.22 --> 610.44
like they fill up all these walls and

608.04 --> 612.06
stuff like you know but the reality is

610.44 --> 614.6400000000001
just this this is the core issue

612.06 --> 617.8199999999999
actually this is not you know it's like

614.64 --> 620.399
it's very very simple it's so simple I

617.82 --> 622.5600000000001
was like when I read it I'm like yeah it

620.399 --> 625.2
makes sense but it's you know here

622.56 --> 628.0799999999999
common sense is not common practice so

625.2 --> 630.839
we know that stuff like that people want

628.08 --> 634.019
to get it but it's also the unawareness

630.839 --> 636.36
and we can say we can blame like I don't

634.019 --> 638.16
want to blame people too too much all

636.36 --> 640.5600000000001
the time because uh for their condition

638.16 --> 643.0799999999999
because I think they're very I was very

640.56 --> 645.54
unaware myself like the abyss of

643.08 --> 648.1800000000001
unawareness goes deeply

645.54 --> 651.36
yeah an event is also because I mean

648.18 --> 653.6999999999999
finally like you are yourself and like

651.36 --> 655.86
and whatever you know or don't know I

653.7 --> 658.38
mean it's known to you I mean you can't

655.86 --> 660.1800000000001
be aware or unaware of that it just is

658.38 --> 662.1
it's a very simple thing you know like

660.18 --> 664.019
whatever you know or you don't know you

662.1 --> 667.019
have very clear idea about that actually

664.019 --> 669.18
if you look into it but if you choose

667.019 --> 671.399
not to look into something that's also

669.18 --> 673.56
your choice right it's a choice like

671.399 --> 675.66
that you choose to look into that or you

673.56 --> 677.8199999999999
don't choose to look into it it's a it's

675.66 --> 680.2199999999999
an option which you have got you know as

677.82 --> 681.72
a human being you have that option to

680.22 --> 684.24
choose to look into it or not to choose

681.72 --> 685.9200000000001
and people look the other way it's

684.24 --> 687.54
called putting the head in the sand you

685.92 --> 690.4799999999999
know like ostrich puts the head in the

687.54 --> 693.14
sand or you know and uh or

690.48 --> 695.279
um just carries on in a robotic

693.14 --> 696.959
automatic kind of way like you know

695.279 --> 697.92
where you choose to not pay any

696.959 --> 700.1999999999999
attention

697.92 --> 701.76
to that kind of situation you know like

700.2 --> 704.339
because even if you are four years old

701.76 --> 706.38
or five years old three four five you

704.339 --> 707.9590000000001
are automatically no I don't know you

706.38 --> 710.459
know like

707.959 --> 711.779
nobody at that age you automatically

710.459 --> 713.88
know that you're looking around and you

711.779 --> 715.5
don't know what is this what is this a

713.88 --> 717.48
tree what is this what is the Apple what

715.5 --> 719.64
is this what is this you don't know like

717.48 --> 721.32
I mean it's a very clear thing it's not

719.64 --> 724.56
a very

721.32 --> 727.44
you know but it's also the child

724.56 --> 730.6199999999999
mentality also that that we haven't but

727.44 --> 732.7790000000001
I don't know if it's child because uh to

730.62 --> 734.76
be a child I heard one of you if they

732.779 --> 737.279
were I don't think it's you that was

734.76 --> 739.74
talking about that yeah who are the

737.279 --> 741.779
child who are the children or yeah and

739.74 --> 743.0
what beings I know kids what's the

741.779 --> 746.1
difference between children and kids

743.0 --> 748.079
exactly okay yeah yeah the children

746.1 --> 751.86
means like the beings who have like that

748.079 --> 753.8389999999999
in like ability to do sort of uh

751.86 --> 757.38
understand that they don't know

753.839 --> 759.24
and then learn You Know You observe and

757.38 --> 761.279
you find out you don't know you know

759.24 --> 763.62
like where are you what is all this like

761.279 --> 766.56
you have this feeling immediately

763.62 --> 768.66
when you look around is that thing and

766.56 --> 771.3599999999999
kids is like where you don't care about

768.66 --> 773.399
whether you know something or you don't

771.36 --> 775.0790000000001
you just want that candy or you just

773.399 --> 776.639
want that you want to put that other

775.079 --> 779.16
person down or you want to attract

776.639 --> 782.22
attention or whatever you know you don't

779.16 --> 787.56
care about actually knowing something

782.22 --> 790.38
you know yeah and that child mentality

787.56 --> 791.88
that I was talking about also uh like

790.38 --> 794.459
you you don't think there will be

791.88 --> 796.079
consequences to your nonsense so you

794.459 --> 798.8389999999999
just keep doing it and doing it and

796.079 --> 801.959
doing it that's a good mentality not

798.839 --> 803.22
child child will actually uh not do

801.959 --> 807.3
anything because it doesn't know

803.22 --> 808.9200000000001
anything so it is okay okay it is very

807.3 --> 811.68
uh cautious

808.92 --> 814.38
okay because when you don't know you're

811.68 --> 815.8199999999999
very cautious because you don't know for

814.38 --> 818.9399999999999
sure so then how can you do something

815.82 --> 822.0600000000001
you know you you're not confident in any

818.94 --> 824.7790000000001
action really you know okay so the

822.06 --> 827.04
foolish mentality it's better

824.779 --> 829.139
like a brat you know what I call a bad

827.04 --> 831.54
brat like in English it's called brat

829.139 --> 833.279
you know like you know like when kids

831.54 --> 834.66
are like at four they're five they're

833.279 --> 837.06
crying and stuff like like you know like

834.66 --> 840.3
if they don't get a candy they start

837.06 --> 843.3599999999999
holdering and crying and no I want it I

840.3 --> 846.7199999999999
want it like you know that kind of you

843.36 --> 850.32
know yeah is it possible that you use

846.72 --> 852.1800000000001
the word brat when I see him there is B

850.32 --> 855.12
rap you know what has to do with the rap

852.18 --> 857.6999999999999
but also if you look at the rats they

855.12 --> 860.519
are the the species on Earth that

857.7 --> 863.339
reproduce the fastest it's a 21 day

860.519 --> 865.86
gestation period the rat and this is

863.339 --> 869.5790000000001
actually speaking so there is a produced

865.86 --> 872.779
very fast yeah and and they there's a

869.579 --> 876.42
rat race too you know that's it

872.779 --> 878.899
is it have you uh came to this uh

876.42 --> 881.76
conclusion too

878.899 --> 884.22
yeah you know but but they start that

881.76 --> 886.56
from a very young age like so if you

884.22 --> 888.48
start that from age of three or four

886.56 --> 890.88
because these things all start from that

888.48 --> 894.6
age actually two three four five like

890.88 --> 897.12
all this you know because at that time

894.6 --> 898.5600000000001
you are into this world and it's all new

897.12 --> 900.66
to you everything is strange and

898.56 --> 903.42
everything is you know you you have very

900.66 --> 905.88
clear understanding that you don't have

903.42 --> 907.8
any grasp on anything here so how you

905.88 --> 910.139
start from that point is the most

907.8 --> 912.06
important Point actually and if you

910.139 --> 914.88
don't do it at that age obviously you

912.06 --> 917.6389999999999
can do it at any age you can start out

914.88 --> 918.8389999999999
feel like that feel like three

917.639 --> 921.66
again

918.839 --> 924.24
but but that is the most important bit

921.66 --> 926.2199999999999
uh because that's the starting point one

924.24 --> 927.24
has to start from that point like there

926.22 --> 930.5400000000001
is no

927.24 --> 934.019
other starting point yeah even though um

930.54 --> 936.0
like a bit I'm over 40 but I don't feel

934.019 --> 938.4590000000001
like that I feel very young because I'm

936.0 --> 940.019
just like reborn or something and

938.459 --> 942.06
something happened to me I don't know

940.019 --> 944.04
I've been struck by lightning or

942.06 --> 945.5999999999999
something something hit me on the top of

944.04 --> 947.459
the head or I don't know what would

945.6 --> 950.399
happen but I mean and that's what

947.459 --> 951.899
matters but yeah yes yeah so that's what

950.399 --> 953.579
I'm saying no matter what your age is

951.899 --> 954.959
you will have to feel like that and you

953.579 --> 957.2399999999999
have to start from that starting point

954.959 --> 958.9799999999999
to actually get somewhere you know

957.24 --> 961.5
there's no other starting point for

958.98 --> 963.66
anything you have to have that uh very

961.5 --> 966.24
clear that thing okay I have no idea I

963.66 --> 967.68
have no clue I don't know but I'm gonna

966.24 --> 970.74
find out and I'm gonna

967.68 --> 972.8389999999999
learn like you know learning attitude

970.74 --> 975.66
like you know like that I'm I'm going to

972.839 --> 978.48
learn and uh that and that is the way

975.66 --> 980.9399999999999
any like a proper being should be I mean

978.48 --> 983.04
there should be no other way of being

980.94 --> 984.48
like if you try any other way of being

983.04 --> 987.66
you are not being true to anything

984.48 --> 990.12
actually and then all everything will go

987.66 --> 991.92
wrong from that point you know so so

990.12 --> 994.079
that's why people who get the success

991.92 --> 996.12
and stuff even whatever in the world and

994.079 --> 999.3
they are very miserable and depressed

996.12 --> 1001.519
and all of that because of that reason

999.3 --> 1004.459
only like you know they they don't have

1001.519 --> 1007.339
any real movement

1004.459 --> 1009.2589999999999
you know so so so that's so that's the

1007.339 --> 1011.0600000000001
thing so I mean people have to realize

1009.259 --> 1012.5600000000001
that individually it's individual thing

1011.06 --> 1014.1199999999999
each one has to

1012.56 --> 1016.16
individually come to that conclusion

1014.12 --> 1020.18
it's not a mass thing you know it's not

1016.16 --> 1022.519
like someone as a whole can get to that

1020.18 --> 1025.819
it has to be person to person to person

1022.519 --> 1029.0
being to being individual to individual

1025.819 --> 1030.6789999999999
thing you know it can't be like like

1029.0 --> 1033.62
forced upon

1030.679 --> 1035.7800000000002
as a whole to the that thing but yeah

1033.62 --> 1037.339
but if if like like I'm saying these

1035.78 --> 1038.839
things or these kind of things are being

1037.339 --> 1041.4189999999999
broadcasted then people might hear it

1038.839 --> 1043.8799999999999
and it might start a spark

1041.419 --> 1046.939
somewhere in them you know like where

1043.88 --> 1048.7990000000002
they feel like yeah this is the right

1046.939 --> 1050.66
thing to do or whatever and that's

1048.799 --> 1051.98
there's a whole point where while I'm

1050.66 --> 1055.66
even speaking these things out there's

1051.98 --> 1055.66
no other reason you know yeah because

1057.039 --> 1065.059
it's not very hard to to like get a

1061.16 --> 1066.98
sense of what we feel and that I mean I

1065.059 --> 1070.3999999999999
mean it's just natural I think we are

1066.98 --> 1073.16
very immature and by being immature

1070.4 --> 1075.919
being you're very not aligned with you

1073.16 --> 1078.6200000000001
know nature and nature very close word

1075.919 --> 1081.98
together yeah yeah mature Nature Nature

1078.62 --> 1085.28
Nature yeah yeah so I think there is a

1081.98 --> 1087.799
lack of maturity in our beings and I

1085.28 --> 1090.3799999999999
think once you start also going with

1087.799 --> 1093.02
true learning

1090.38 --> 1095.179
and simplicity it's very simple it's

1093.02 --> 1097.039
very simple like you don't know you

1095.179 --> 1098.6000000000001
don't know you don't know admit it you

1097.039 --> 1100.94
don't know it's simple like it's it's

1098.6 --> 1102.6789999999999
not so it's not so tough like you I'm

1100.94 --> 1104.78
saying I mean even like a lot of people

1102.679 --> 1106.3400000000001
I mean who do shows right now and they

1104.78 --> 1107.539
come and they all come like they know

1106.34 --> 1109.28
something and everybody's like

1107.539 --> 1111.26
professing knowledge and like that thing

1109.28 --> 1113.299
but I know that most of those people

1111.26 --> 1116.059
don't even have a basic lifestyle they

1113.299 --> 1118.6399999999999
don't know how to live at all and it's a

1116.059 --> 1121.34
very very tough thing to like give out

1118.64 --> 1123.44
all these kind of things to people while

1121.34 --> 1125.0
not focusing on Basics you know and

1123.44 --> 1126.6200000000001
which is to me is like what you do with

1125.0 --> 1128.78
the body with the human body you know

1126.62 --> 1131.0
that's the very very core basic for me

1128.78 --> 1133.16
you know like if what are you doing with

1131.0 --> 1134.72
it actually like all the time how do you

1133.16 --> 1137.9
use it how do you utilize it the only

1134.72 --> 1140.179
tool you have got you know like so what

1137.9 --> 1142.76
you actually do with it yeah like in

1140.179 --> 1144.8600000000001
your time on Earth so and instead of

1142.76 --> 1146.419
like saying you know and people people

1144.86 --> 1147.62
get excited you know right now even if

1146.419 --> 1149.8400000000001
they come to know little things about

1147.62 --> 1151.039
even if words and stuff if they come to

1149.84 --> 1154.039
know some meanings of something people

1151.039 --> 1155.539
get very excited you know but the thing

1154.039 --> 1158.96
is that in that excitement one should

1155.539 --> 1161.36
not lose sight of the fact that that you

1158.96 --> 1164.24
still have to work on Basics right now

1161.36 --> 1166.82
you know that's and that's the thing you

1164.24 --> 1168.74
should not Overlook that and go for the

1166.82 --> 1171.02
secondary internally I've called them

1168.74 --> 1173.419
secondaries and tertiaries you know so

1171.02 --> 1176.36
and not the primary like you know yeah

1173.419 --> 1178.16
but again it's honestly if you're honest

1176.36 --> 1180.9189999999999
with your being you know you're probably

1178.16 --> 1182.78
uh like what you're doing is not working

1180.919 --> 1186.74
on yourself but working outside of

1182.78 --> 1188.84
yourself like astrology most astrologers

1186.74 --> 1191.6200000000001
that talk about astrology have never

1188.84 --> 1194.72
observed the Stars

1191.62 --> 1197.9599999999998
this is truly when I was bringing it up

1194.72 --> 1200.6000000000001
to uh razen the other day I'm like bro I

1197.96 --> 1202.82
I look I talk about astrology with PT

1200.6 --> 1206.24
with you with uh actually with everyone

1202.82 --> 1208.039
almost yeah I still can't wrap my head

1206.24 --> 1211.64
around it because I haven't observed it

1208.039 --> 1213.2
so yeah I mean yeah that's it I mean

1211.64 --> 1214.8200000000002
most astronomers haven't I mean I say

1213.2 --> 1217.4
that point in so many times I've said

1214.82 --> 1219.08
that that maturity 99 of installers had

1217.4 --> 1220.7
never seen the Stars astrologers I'm not

1219.08 --> 1222.28
talking about people who are even I'm

1220.7 --> 1224.24
talking about actual practicing

1222.28 --> 1227.1789999999999
astrologers they have never seen the

1224.24 --> 1228.86
stars 99 of them okay so that's uh

1227.179 --> 1230.299
that's the reality of it like that's the

1228.86 --> 1231.6789999999999
reality of the city that's what we have

1230.299 --> 1233.4189999999999
come to in this world like I mean that's

1231.679 --> 1234.3200000000002
where I mean people are using a mobile

1233.419 --> 1236.0
phone

1234.32 --> 1238.7
everybody use them but we know people

1236.0 --> 1240.5
don't know how a mobile phone works okay

1238.7 --> 1242.96
people use a TV but they don't know how

1240.5 --> 1245.299
TV works okay they have no idea no clue

1242.96 --> 1248.059
as to what device they are holding and

1245.299 --> 1250.039
what is the principle of the device and

1248.059 --> 1252.9189999999999
if you use a device and you don't know

1250.039 --> 1254.78
the principle of it okay it will finally

1252.919 --> 1258.5590000000002
harm you in the end

1254.78 --> 1260.66
okay I mean it's yeah I mean people

1258.559 --> 1261.9189999999999
don't understand it's like a very uh

1260.66 --> 1264.02
they don't understand how that will

1261.919 --> 1266.419
happen but it will happen you know

1264.02 --> 1268.52
because before you use something you're

1266.419 --> 1269.9
supposed to know the principle of it you

1268.52 --> 1272.24
know that's

1269.9 --> 1274.5800000000002
because that puts you in a good standing

1272.24 --> 1277.1
with what you are using actually you

1274.58 --> 1280.8799999999999
know it it brings you maturity

1277.1 --> 1284.48
and wisdom to actually use that device

1280.88 --> 1286.5800000000002
okay and if you just want to go up like

1284.48 --> 1288.08
like everybody can have that and they

1286.58 --> 1288.98
don't understand the principle behind

1288.08 --> 1291.26
anything

1288.98 --> 1293.659
I'm saying any device they use then they

1291.26 --> 1295.46
are in for trouble like actually they're

1293.659 --> 1298.8200000000002
creating trouble for themselves you know

1295.46 --> 1301.52
so yep

1298.82 --> 1303.2
the denial that you are in trouble is

1301.52 --> 1305.36
very it's more important than anything

1303.2 --> 1307.3400000000001
else like you will deny all that stuff

1305.36 --> 1309.3799999999999
that's why you go with the next one you

1307.34 --> 1311.539
say some say they don't believe in hell

1309.38 --> 1314.0
but I don't see where like you were

1311.539 --> 1317.5
believing or not has anything to do in

1314.0 --> 1320.0
there like even with like you see here

1317.5 --> 1322.28
semi-consciousness you can realize these

1320.0 --> 1324.74
things but then I mean you need honesty

1322.28 --> 1326.8999999999999
to make a change within yourself so yeah

1324.74 --> 1328.82
it's I mean I mean pain is all around us

1326.9 --> 1330.6200000000001
in this world I mean it's very painful

1328.82 --> 1332.299
like uh people are having physical pain

1330.62 --> 1333.7399999999998
people are having mental pain people are

1332.299 --> 1335.72
having emotional pain people are having

1333.74 --> 1337.58
all kinds of pain out there I mean what

1335.72 --> 1339.8600000000001
is there to not see I mean it's uh it's

1337.58 --> 1340.8999999999999
uh I mean even if you are a quarter

1339.86 --> 1345.62
conscious

1340.9 --> 1347.96
you can perceive uh There Is No Death to

1345.62 --> 1350.4799999999998
it I mean it's it's all around I mean uh

1347.96 --> 1352.64
I mean hell is just a word for pain okay

1350.48 --> 1356.08
just because you use a different word

1352.64 --> 1358.5200000000002
doesn't take away the actual

1356.08 --> 1360.5
you know like hell is not some separate

1358.52 --> 1362.78
thing it's just pain that's all it is

1360.5 --> 1365.059
like so I mean and that is all around

1362.78 --> 1366.86
everyone for everyone to feel an

1365.059 --> 1368.12
experience out here and where is the

1366.86 --> 1370.36
believing required I mean I don't

1368.12 --> 1370.36
understand

1376.96 --> 1383.419
this is the denial partner that we are

1380.9 --> 1387.44
sometimes very much caught up in and the

1383.419 --> 1390.14
ego refuses to admit so the ego has to

1387.44 --> 1393.6200000000001
be thinner they're a bit thinner than it

1390.14 --> 1395.9
is I I see the ego like a big heavy coat

1393.62 --> 1399.6789999999999
that we wear a big armor and you get it

1395.9 --> 1401.7800000000002
in that stuff to the very player ego is

1399.679 --> 1404.0590000000002
also just a sense of false knowing okay

1401.78 --> 1405.559
you know like it's um and uh and the

1404.059 --> 1407.96
first sense of false knowing it is a

1405.559 --> 1409.82
sort of uh feed it to by the education

1407.96 --> 1411.919
system right now you know because

1409.82 --> 1413.84
education system makes you think that

1411.919 --> 1415.2800000000002
you know something okay it makes you

1413.84 --> 1417.799
think that you know the sun is what is

1415.28 --> 1419.299
happening in the sun okay so there you

1417.799 --> 1422.24
say oh Sun nuclear fusion is happening

1419.299 --> 1423.9189999999999
okay now now then uh then you feel like

1422.24 --> 1425.419
then then the ego thinks okay I know

1423.919 --> 1427.88
about the sun now this this is done now

1425.419 --> 1431.0
okay I know sky is blue because of

1427.88 --> 1433.7
nitrogen okay I mean now then you think

1431.0 --> 1435.32
that okay I know now okay so then all

1433.7 --> 1437.059
these false knowings layers of knowing

1435.32 --> 1440.84
just keep on making the thing what you

1437.059 --> 1442.34
call ego like you know it's just a false

1440.84 --> 1444.4399999999998
sense of knowing that's all it is like

1442.34 --> 1446.24
so I mean uh so once you come to know

1444.44 --> 1448.46
the reality like now people came to know

1446.24 --> 1450.02
it was not a ball okay they thought it

1448.46 --> 1451.94
was a ball now and they know it's not a

1450.02 --> 1453.799
ball okay now all of that ego gets

1451.94 --> 1455.539
destroyed oh I knew about that but I

1453.799 --> 1457.8799999999999
don't know about this anymore like so

1455.539 --> 1459.26
the point is that um a lot of ego

1457.88 --> 1459.98
destroying things are happening right

1459.26 --> 1462.08
now

1459.98 --> 1463.4
like people have to face a lot of things

1462.08 --> 1466.8799999999999
right now that they don't know anything

1463.4 --> 1468.2
you know you know like that is what is

1466.88 --> 1470.659
happening through YouTube and stuff in

1468.2 --> 1473.059
the last five six seven ten years that

1470.659 --> 1475.0390000000002
people a lot of people's sense of

1473.059 --> 1479.4189999999999
knowing

1475.039 --> 1481.1589999999999
is being shattered like you know so then

1479.419 --> 1484.5800000000002
that that it automatically breaks down

1481.159 --> 1486.679
your ego because you thought you knew

1484.58 --> 1489.6789999999999
but reality is you didn't know you had

1486.679 --> 1490.7
no clue like you know so so so that that

1489.679 --> 1493.52
is

1490.7 --> 1496.159
what is happening and again if we talk

1493.52 --> 1499.28
we were talking about astrology and to

1496.159 --> 1501.0800000000002
me to know about that strategy like you

1499.28 --> 1503.48
have to know you have to be an observer

1501.08 --> 1505.58
first of all you have to observe people

1503.48 --> 1507.799
observe things observe the Stars the sun

1505.58 --> 1509.8999999999999
observe everything around you but most

1507.799 --> 1512.179
people do not observe and they do not

1509.9 --> 1513.679
take time to observe that the thing to

1512.179 --> 1516.74
rush to stressed out too much

1513.679 --> 1518.9
responsibility in Babylon and uh I don't

1516.74 --> 1521.96
know it's too much it's just too much

1518.9 --> 1523.64
yes yes I mean that's what it is they

1521.96 --> 1525.559
make complications for themselves you

1523.64 --> 1527.3600000000001
know life is not simple anymore like

1525.559 --> 1529.82
life could be very simple but now they

1527.36 --> 1531.5
made it more uh like papers and this and

1529.82 --> 1533.72
that and all of this

1531.5 --> 1536.24
Madness complicated structure has been

1533.72 --> 1538.22
created because once you go above beyond

1536.24 --> 1539.72
the pure principles your life is become

1538.22 --> 1543.8600000000001
going to become complicated and

1539.72 --> 1546.74
complication is hell okay what is hell I

1543.86 --> 1549.6789999999999
mean mortgage more gas

1546.74 --> 1552.5
yeah it's a complication is hell you

1549.679 --> 1554.299
know like I mean complication is hell I

1552.5 --> 1555.62
mean that's all I mean Simplicity is

1554.299 --> 1557.6589999999999
that thing if you understand something

1555.62 --> 1559.8799999999999
simple simply and clearly and things and

1557.659 --> 1562.3400000000001
that then that's a nice clear feeling

1559.88 --> 1566.24
which is opposite of Health you know

1562.34 --> 1568.039
yeah we like to add complication and

1566.24 --> 1570.08
stress to our life too which seems to be

1568.039 --> 1572.6589999999999
very good at that and that's why we go

1570.08 --> 1575.12
into depth you know here in Canada and

1572.659 --> 1576.74
us it's crazy the the crit cards the

1575.12 --> 1580.58
more gauge like I was saying and all

1576.74 --> 1583.34
that the very when you are stuck in that

1580.58 --> 1585.3799999999999
well I wouldn't sleep at night yeah I

1583.34 --> 1588.74
don't know it's not my experience that I

1585.38 --> 1589.88
have very very yeah I mean I mean it's I

1588.74 --> 1591.919
mean the point is when you have a

1589.88 --> 1593.48
structure which is a financial structure

1591.919 --> 1595.1000000000001
or any structure which is there right

1593.48 --> 1596.539
now which is not based on any Divine

1595.1 --> 1599.059
principles which is not Beethoven based

1596.539 --> 1601.82
on any natural principles then things

1599.059 --> 1604.039
are going to go crazy anyways I mean you

1601.82 --> 1605.48
can't stop the craziness once it started

1604.039 --> 1608.0
from that root level even though

1605.48 --> 1610.82
structures are built on not any real

1608.0 --> 1612.679
principle like on based on anything so

1610.82 --> 1614.059
if you make something and people are

1612.679 --> 1616.039
trapped in that people think of that as

1614.059 --> 1619.82
real and put all their life and energy

1616.039 --> 1622.039
and uh into that then they will pay and

1619.82 --> 1624.6789999999999
suffer you know for for that kind of

1622.039 --> 1626.299
nonsense I mean their structure is not

1624.679 --> 1628.279
real of any kind like this financial

1626.299 --> 1629.84
structure or any structure which is I

1628.279 --> 1631.34
mean it's it's I mean a lot of people

1629.84 --> 1633.799
now are talking about in YouTube people

1631.34 --> 1635.6589999999999
can do the research and find out you

1633.799 --> 1638.779
know that how this structure is not real

1635.659 --> 1641.779
and you know it's not so like better so

1638.779 --> 1644.059
much information at our fingertips it's

1641.779 --> 1645.919
crazy today if we don't learn it's

1644.059 --> 1649.94
because we don't want to learn we have

1645.919 --> 1652.7
like and that I can do that I mean I I

1649.94 --> 1654.98
can force people to learn I have a deep

1652.7 --> 1657.0800000000002
desire myself and that's why I'm here

1654.98 --> 1659.779
sharing it with you live and Direct on

1657.08 --> 1662.8999999999999
YouTube because I think share a bow so

1659.779 --> 1664.82
but anyway I know I mean people if in

1662.9 --> 1667.3400000000001
this time there is no excuses there are

1664.82 --> 1670.6399999999999
no excuses okay but that's what we do we

1667.34 --> 1673.58
make excuses after excuses yeah yeah

1670.64 --> 1675.8600000000001
yeah I mean because everything is there

1673.58 --> 1677.84
more more I mean all the things are

1675.86 --> 1679.2199999999998
coming out you know the truth the

1677.84 --> 1681.1399999999999
reality of different things is all

1679.22 --> 1683.779
coming out you know it's a time we live

1681.14 --> 1685.5200000000002
in where there will be no excuses so if

1683.779 --> 1687.44
anybody does that they do that

1685.52 --> 1689.4189999999999
consciously and that's their own dishes

1687.44 --> 1690.0800000000002
and choice to put their head into the

1689.419 --> 1691.76
sand

1690.08 --> 1693.02
if someone decides to put their head

1691.76 --> 1695.6589999999999
into the sand that's their own choice

1693.02 --> 1698.96
and decision okay and then they'll be

1695.659 --> 1701.9
held liable for that yeah but can there

1698.96 --> 1705.08
be choice in decision in an unconscious

1701.9 --> 1708.3200000000002
being very unaware like I I don't feel

1705.08 --> 1710.779
like I was really choosing uh 10 years

1708.32 --> 1712.46
ago when I was doing like I was very you

1710.779 --> 1714.86
were still making a choice knows it's

1712.46 --> 1717.5
like you're under it nose hypnosis yes

1714.86 --> 1720.1999999999998
but yeah but the thing is that uh there

1717.5 --> 1721.94
are things like there are moments for

1720.2 --> 1723.98
anyone even new at different times there

1721.94 --> 1726.559
would be different moments where you

1723.98 --> 1728.9
will look at something and you will

1726.559 --> 1730.94
ponder for a little bit and you'll feel

1728.9 --> 1733.22
like something is wrong here or you'll

1730.94 --> 1735.919
get that little bit of a feeling you

1733.22 --> 1738.14
know at different times you know that

1735.919 --> 1739.7
okay this doesn't seem quite right okay

1738.14 --> 1742.64
this doesn't seem quite right you know

1739.7 --> 1745.4
like it will happen even in the deepest

1742.64 --> 1747.6200000000001
hypnosis or unconsciousness or whatever

1745.4 --> 1751.76
you want to call it like there is gonna

1747.62 --> 1753.9189999999999
be some little glimmer of shreds of

1751.76 --> 1756.14
things which will affect you and it's

1753.919 --> 1759.26
like whether you take that further it's

1756.14 --> 1761.179
up to you again you can either let it go

1759.26 --> 1763.34
and just say okay I won't bother about

1761.179 --> 1766.22
that doesn't matter it happens a little

1763.34 --> 1767.72
bit but I will just or you take it

1766.22 --> 1770.96
further you know so there is a choice

1767.72 --> 1772.94
there too in that you know yeah because

1770.96 --> 1775.64
I did a conscious choice at one point

1772.94 --> 1777.919
like I knew from the age of 15 baby

1775.64 --> 1781.3990000000001
learn and the like everybody can

1777.919 --> 1783.3200000000002
perceive it's not really it's not the

1781.399 --> 1786.399
greatest thing to kill each other at War

1783.32 --> 1790.6399999999999
and stuff like that yeah everybody can

1786.399 --> 1793.399
realize that like uh so there is

1790.64 --> 1795.5
something at one point that came in I

1793.399 --> 1798.799
took a decision I took a decision at one

1795.5 --> 1801.2
point to go on YouTube and start looking

1798.799 --> 1804.32
what people were talking about like you

1801.2 --> 1806.0
know you and there's truth I I think

1804.32 --> 1808.399
there's truth in what we do what we are

1806.0 --> 1811.22
and what we say so it's very important

1808.399 --> 1813.34
to let it out you know fruit

1811.22 --> 1815.48
it sucks

1813.34 --> 1816.86
yeah so when you get a little bit of

1815.48 --> 1819.98
something glimmer little something

1816.86 --> 1821.539
little insight to take it further okay

1819.98 --> 1823.58
to take the thing further that's your

1821.539 --> 1827.26
decision or you can just like give us a

1823.58 --> 1829.6399999999999
spark you can just throw water on it and

1827.26 --> 1832.1589999999999
yeah that is also your decision I mean

1829.64 --> 1833.8400000000001
it's I mean a both are your decision

1832.159 --> 1836.8400000000001
whether you're gonna put make it further

1833.84 --> 1840.4399999999998
into a fire or you're gonna throw water

1836.84 --> 1843.1999999999998
on it like both are your decisions yeah

1840.44 --> 1845.179
I mean it comes to admission also admit

1843.2 --> 1847.82
that uh you know that you're trapped in

1845.179 --> 1850.22
hell but most people do not want to

1847.82 --> 1852.799
admit that they're to themselves they're

1850.22 --> 1856.1000000000001
trapped in hell because first of all L

1852.799 --> 1858.2
is with fire and beings with like corns

1856.1 --> 1861.26
and like stuff on the head and you know

1858.2 --> 1863.1200000000001
we have this idea of hell it can be for

1861.26 --> 1865.52
us so it's there's gonna be fire and

1863.12 --> 1867.5
weird the red beings around and you know

1865.52 --> 1871.1589999999999
that's the idea I haven't held before

1867.5 --> 1872.38
but yes today I know I'm still some time

1871.159 --> 1875.48
living in

1872.38 --> 1878.0
the point is uh that fire is all this

1875.48 --> 1879.679
fire of complications you know what you

1878.0 --> 1882.679
say like all these things that is the

1879.679 --> 1884.3600000000001
fire okay that is the fire too that you

1882.679 --> 1887.0590000000002
people don't understand that's not it is

1884.36 --> 1888.1399999999999
also fire like you know so and for

1887.059 --> 1890.48
example if you don't know you're in

1888.14 --> 1892.3990000000001
prison then you will not try to break

1890.48 --> 1894.38
out you know even if movies like Escape

1892.399 --> 1896.4189999999999
from Alcatraz or whatever prison and

1894.38 --> 1898.88
stuff I mean you have to first know you

1896.419 --> 1901.46
are in a prison then only you will be

1898.88 --> 1903.44
able to uh chart your way out of it you

1901.46 --> 1904.76
know you have to know that first like

1903.44 --> 1907.3400000000001
you know you have to first understand

1904.76 --> 1911.419
there are walls in this prison there are

1907.34 --> 1913.76
bars okay and those bars and walls

1911.419 --> 1916.88
people face every day and there's you

1913.76 --> 1920.419
know it's not people do face these walls

1916.88 --> 1921.98
and bars every day you know uh and they

1920.419 --> 1923.48
then they can say oh there are no walls

1921.98 --> 1925.64
there are no bars I mean they can say

1923.48 --> 1926.3600000000001
that but the reality is they face it you

1925.64 --> 1928.88
know

1926.36 --> 1930.26
yeah but maybe we don't see the bars and

1928.88 --> 1932.72
all that stuff because we have been

1930.26 --> 1935.539
transformed into guarding that prison

1932.72 --> 1937.159
more than being in that like we're we're

1935.539 --> 1939.799
guards we're all transformed into

1937.159 --> 1941.8400000000001
guarding the stuff of Babylon to make

1939.799 --> 1944.0
sure it stays intact and we don't move

1941.84 --> 1946.22
out of this Elisha if you can get the

1944.0 --> 1948.86
prisoners to guard the prison itself

1946.22 --> 1951.3990000000001
then that's a good tactic isn't it

1948.86 --> 1951.399
I mean

1951.679 --> 1957.0800000000002
for sure yeah I mean if the prisoners

1954.919 --> 1959.72
itself are used for guarding the prison

1957.08 --> 1962.1789999999999
then you don't need extra people to

1959.72 --> 1964.159
you know keep them in there you know

1962.179 --> 1966.799
like it if you get their business to

1964.159 --> 1968.1200000000001
guard the present itself you know but I

1966.799 --> 1970.46
mean everybody experiences the prism

1968.12 --> 1972.1589999999999
it's not that anybody out here can say

1970.46 --> 1975.26
that they have never

1972.159 --> 1977.6000000000001
experienced this prison life yeah but

1975.26 --> 1980.0
it's the feeling it's the feeling of

1977.6 --> 1982.8799999999999
feeling trap and that's the next thing

1980.0 --> 1984.799
here the feeling of feeling trap and if

1982.88 --> 1986.48
you don't feel that you're not gonna

1984.799 --> 1988.7
want to move out of this nonsense right

1986.48 --> 1990.8600000000001
yeah I was feeling trapped in bed you

1988.7 --> 1992.8400000000001
learned like crazy though so I had to be

1990.86 --> 1995.1789999999999
out of this nonsense but yeah that was

1992.84 --> 1997.34
my feeling someone could be another

1995.179 --> 2000.3990000000001
feeling but if you don't have that trap

1997.34 --> 2002.32
feeling you know I think there is nobody

2000.399 --> 2003.8799999999999
like very few people who will not have

2002.32 --> 2005.3799999999999
that trap feeling I mean everybody gets

2003.88 --> 2007.3600000000001
that trap feeling even even if you're a

2005.38 --> 2008.7990000000002
billionaire you still unders you feel

2007.36 --> 2010.9599999999998
the traps and stuff out there you know

2008.799 --> 2012.279
like you you go out there and you you

2010.96 --> 2013.48
face this that you can't do this you

2012.279 --> 2015.1
can't do that you can't do this you

2013.48 --> 2016.419
can't do that you can't you can't get

2015.1 --> 2019.08
things you can't do that like you can't

2016.419 --> 2021.519
there are

2019.08 --> 2025.36
boundaries and that things everywhere

2021.519 --> 2028.179
there yeah the limitations are a plenty

2025.36 --> 2030.2199999999998
you know like yeah yeah and you

2028.179 --> 2032.019
experience it a lot because you travel

2030.22 --> 2035.26
and you see it every time you go to

2032.019 --> 2037.6
another country or this that a bunch of

2035.26 --> 2039.279
paper nonsense papers for what I mean

2037.6 --> 2041.019
everywhere everything anything you do in

2039.279 --> 2042.7
this world and in the especially and the

2041.019 --> 2045.519
limitation of your own body in

2042.7 --> 2047.44
limitation of the whole that thing then

2045.519 --> 2049.96
the system there are so many limitations

2047.44 --> 2051.52
that if anybody is saying that they're

2049.96 --> 2052.899
not experiencing these limitations I

2051.52 --> 2056.44
mean they're just lying I mean there's

2052.899 --> 2058.2999999999997
cannot be any other thing to it and if

2056.44 --> 2059.98
you're lying to yourself then and you

2058.3 --> 2062.2000000000003
know then the matter ends anyways

2059.98 --> 2063.94
there's nothing further

2062.2 --> 2066.879
which can happen from that point you

2063.94 --> 2069.04
know but once you wake up once you ex

2066.879 --> 2071.44
like realize and once once you accept

2069.04 --> 2073.839
then it's a different thing then you can

2071.44 --> 2076.06
work towards something I mean and that's

2073.839 --> 2079.0
the work which people have to do like

2076.06 --> 2080.679
you know like and uh I mean I mean even

2079.0 --> 2082.179
at Universe I mean if people aren't

2080.679 --> 2084.82
feeling trapped then why are they taking

2082.179 --> 2085.96
all these drugs you know why are they

2084.82 --> 2088.3590000000004
like

2085.96 --> 2089.98
trying to escape and have Escapist

2088.359 --> 2092.2599999999998
Tendencies or drinking alcohol all the

2089.98 --> 2093.879
time and you know and why is this

2092.26 --> 2096.0400000000004
happening if they're not feeding crap I

2093.879 --> 2098.5
mean all these are reactions

2096.04 --> 2100.24
to feeling trapped only is just that

2098.5 --> 2103.2
they are taking the wrong

2100.24 --> 2105.7599999999998
reaction to feeling trapped you know

2103.2 --> 2107.2599999999998
they are take they think that they want

2105.76 --> 2109.0
to take the easy way out

2107.26 --> 2110.92
what looks like the easy way it's not

2109.0 --> 2113.02
easy in the end

2110.92 --> 2115.54
um to all of that trapped feeling you

2113.02 --> 2118.9
know but we seek to escape our nonsense

2115.54 --> 2121.14
a lot often like we know because that's

2118.9 --> 2123.76
why people drink people smoke pot

2121.14 --> 2125.98
excessively and stuff like like we seek

2123.76 --> 2129.28
outside of our nonsense to not face

2125.98 --> 2132.52
reality of our nonsense and to realize

2129.28 --> 2135.119
how but that means that means they are

2132.52 --> 2135.119
feeling the Trap

2136.98 --> 2141.28
you know I know I know nothing and I

2139.359 --> 2144.2799999999997
know I'm deeply up so from there

2141.28 --> 2147.0400000000004
I go from the beginning and I go on and

2144.28 --> 2149.619
but it's right that's the fun part to

2147.04 --> 2151.599
learn that stuff yes yeah but that's why

2149.619 --> 2153.46
but like if people are doing that that

2151.599 --> 2156.52
means they have gotten the bad feeling

2153.46 --> 2157.66
that means they have experienced it so

2156.52 --> 2159.7
they can't say that they have not

2157.66 --> 2163.7799999999997
experienced it they have experienced

2159.7 --> 2166.24
that okay yeah so so it it is it is a

2163.78 --> 2167.8
fact that majority have experienced that

2166.24 --> 2170.3199999999997
drafting because majority are drinking

2167.8 --> 2174.46
and majority are trying to care of it

2170.32 --> 2177.099
okay I mean so so so we can safely say

2174.46 --> 2179.2
that you know that majority of Acts

2177.099 --> 2180.7000000000003
experience that now question is like

2179.2 --> 2183.7599999999998
whether they actually want to get out of

2180.7 --> 2185.2799999999997
it or they want a temporary Escape

2183.76 --> 2188.619
that's

2185.28 --> 2191.26
I think the more you add like the more

2188.619 --> 2192.94
you go in depth and stuff like that the

2191.26 --> 2194.92
more you feel trapped so you got to be

2192.94 --> 2197.56
careful with that kind of stuff but also

2194.92 --> 2200.32
if you look at the word trap I think the

2197.56 --> 2202.9
opposite of being trap is being part of

2200.32 --> 2205.78
something you know be part because you

2202.9 --> 2207.339
look at it it's part yeah that's part of

2205.78 --> 2209.5600000000004
the Multiverse like part part of the

2207.339 --> 2214.839
natural flow part of the force part of

2209.56 --> 2216.52
the whole uh vibration of this and if

2214.839 --> 2218.2599999999998
you're not part of that then you are

2216.52 --> 2220.44
trapped because you're going and tie

2218.26 --> 2220.44
that

2223.02 --> 2229.78
natural basically like natural unnatural

2226.66 --> 2231.22
same thing yeah part trap yeah I mean

2229.78 --> 2232.9
that's why English is quite a clear

2231.22 --> 2236.98
language in these kind of ways

2232.9 --> 2240.82
it has Clarity in its words what it

2236.98 --> 2242.92
means by what it means so so it's a very

2240.82 --> 2244.78
clear code the English language it's

2242.92 --> 2246.64
just absurd though again it's

2244.78 --> 2248.5600000000004
observation of the words that's all I'm

2246.64 --> 2250.72
doing here I observed the word and I

2248.56 --> 2252.82
look at it backward but you know we

2250.72 --> 2255.16
don't think we live backwards so we

2252.82 --> 2256.839
don't look at the word backward but once

2255.16 --> 2259.0
you have a sense that your life is going

2256.839 --> 2260.44
all backward crooked nonsense then

2259.0 --> 2262.54
you're gonna start looking at the words

2260.44 --> 2265.0
and say okay maybe I shouldn't get it

2262.54 --> 2266.5
backwards yeah everything I've written

2265.0 --> 2268.839
in this world so

2266.5 --> 2271.06
that's why a lot of my blogs are my my

2268.839 --> 2273.5789999999997
book and I I decode a lot of the

2271.06 --> 2275.2599999999998
important words in English because uh it

2273.579 --> 2277.9
is English is a not like International

2275.26 --> 2279.5200000000004
Language now mostly people that is one

2277.9 --> 2282.04
language which connects people around

2279.52 --> 2283.599
the world otherwise people will not be

2282.04 --> 2285.7599999999998
able to interact with each other at all

2283.599 --> 2288.339
you know like because if everyone has

2285.76 --> 2290.619
different language so then then you

2288.339 --> 2293.44
cannot like actually interact with each

2290.619 --> 2295.3
other so it is the medium language for

2293.44 --> 2297.28
everybody so it has to be understood

2295.3 --> 2298.78
properly at least that language should

2297.28 --> 2301.48
be understood

2298.78 --> 2303.76
properly which you're going to use

2301.48 --> 2307.3
to communicate with each other around

2303.76 --> 2308.82
the world like so so and uh yeah yeah

2307.3 --> 2311.98
yeah

2308.82 --> 2314.32
and all that of the word and I focus a

2311.98 --> 2316.66
lot on this on gaining Clarity with the

2314.32 --> 2319.3
words because I think if I gain Clarity

2316.66 --> 2321.5989999999997
with the words I'll also gain Clarity in

2319.3 --> 2321.599
the world

2325.079 --> 2330.3390000000004
they look very similar to me so I'm like

2328.3 --> 2333.28
okay it might be the word so I go with

2330.339 --> 2336.099
that stuff and yeah

2333.28 --> 2338.619
okay next next uh you say gone to the

2336.099 --> 2343.42
Moon gone to the moon and that's one

2338.619 --> 2345.88
thing me I all this space related stuff

2343.42 --> 2349.1800000000003
like going to the moon going to Mars all

2345.88 --> 2351.579
this is to make us project outside of

2349.18 --> 2354.8199999999997
ourselves mainly let's to put beings

2351.579 --> 2357.76
outside of themselves and like it's all

2354.82 --> 2359.5
nonsense no no it's also one more thing

2357.76 --> 2360.88
it is actually giving you a feeling that

2359.5 --> 2364.06
you're not in a prison

2360.88 --> 2366.119
that's you it to give you a feeling that

2364.06 --> 2368.7999999999997
you're not in a prison

2366.119 --> 2370.359
that's it yeah they give you a feeling

2368.8 --> 2372.76
that you're not in a prison or you can

2370.359 --> 2375.2799999999997
go here you can go there okay like so it

2372.76 --> 2378.76
gives it gives you this false hope

2375.28 --> 2381.0400000000004
and this Falls that thing because people

2378.76 --> 2382.9
feel trapped okay then then you say like

2381.04 --> 2384.7599999999998
no no we're not trapped we can go to the

2382.9 --> 2386.26
Moon oh we are going to ma some people

2384.76 --> 2388.3
say oh we're going to colonize Mars soon

2386.26 --> 2391.42
we're going to have houses there soon

2388.3 --> 2393.04
we'll be moving there soon okay so this

2391.42 --> 2395.6800000000003
gives people like okay from here we'll

2393.04 --> 2398.44
move to Mars and from Mars we maybe move

2395.68 --> 2400.18
to some other solar system and from this

2398.44 --> 2402.94
other solar system we'll move to it

2400.18 --> 2404.68
gives this people this uh strange

2402.94 --> 2406.2400000000002
feeling of you know that you're not

2404.68 --> 2407.74
trapped in a prison you know because

2406.24 --> 2408.64
when people feel trapped this is the

2407.74 --> 2410.859
release

2408.64 --> 2412.18
which I would say like they give this

2410.859 --> 2414.8199999999997
release

2412.18 --> 2416.2
point you know so that so so that

2414.82 --> 2418.3590000000004
Humanity as a whole feels that they're

2416.2 --> 2420.3999999999996
moving towards something you know that

2418.359 --> 2422.44
they're actually getting somewhere

2420.4 --> 2426.2200000000003
they're going somewhere they're not just

2422.44 --> 2428.38
trapped out here so so it is a big

2426.22 --> 2431.2
psychological sign up I would call it

2428.38 --> 2433.0
like um yeah because also we have to

2431.2 --> 2436.0
observe something when we talk about

2433.0 --> 2438.4
space is there's a limit to what we can

2436.0 --> 2439.839
see how far we can see how big we can

2438.4 --> 2444.28
see and how small we can see there's

2439.839 --> 2447.16
limits so yeah that's it so uh what is

2444.28 --> 2449.1400000000003
all these CGI stuff if stuff millions of

2447.16 --> 2451.5989999999997
light you're like it doesn't make sense

2449.14 --> 2455.2599999999998
it just doesn't make sense so I reject

2451.599 --> 2457.54
it but also I've been there just because

2455.26 --> 2459.82
we are in the space stuff and people do

2457.54 --> 2462.4
not observe that but when they look

2459.82 --> 2466.6600000000003
mostly the instrument they look to look

2462.4 --> 2470.2000000000003
at the stars is a tail it's cope why is

2466.66 --> 2473.5
it not a macroscope if I look small with

2470.2 --> 2476.859
a microscope and I look in space big I

2473.5 --> 2479.5
should have a macroscope why a telescope

2476.859 --> 2481.06
because it tells stories yeah yeah I

2479.5 --> 2482.74
mean it doesn't I mean right now I mean

2481.06 --> 2484.66
you can take any telescopes I mean uh

2482.74 --> 2486.9399999999996
they're nothing they they're useless

2484.66 --> 2489.3999999999996
they don't even you know they're they're

2486.94 --> 2491.5
totally uh that thing and like even from

2489.4 --> 2494.859
a camera like a zoom lens of p900 or

2491.5 --> 2497.079
something you can zoom in more to moon

2494.859 --> 2499.359
and stuff then these so called

2497.079 --> 2501.52
telescopes you know like and um I mean

2499.359 --> 2504.16
uh it's it it's a that thing whatever

2501.52 --> 2506.38
they sell to the masses the telescopes

2504.16 --> 2509.3799999999997
which are in the market they are useless

2506.38 --> 2511.0
there's nothing much you know you've

2509.38 --> 2512.32
seen them you know at all like you know

2511.0 --> 2515.32
their magnification is hardly anything

2512.32 --> 2517.9
so and not only that like the

2515.32 --> 2519.82
observation I did I bought a telescope

2517.9 --> 2522.1600000000003
but I didn't use it much because to me

2519.82 --> 2524.5
if I don't get much from it and like

2522.16 --> 2526.54
it's in the caban now and it's I never

2524.5 --> 2529.06
really took it out I took it out once or

2526.54 --> 2530.98
twice to get a look but yeah but that's

2529.06 --> 2533.0789999999997
all you know that it is use this thing

2530.98 --> 2535.78
it doesn't actually even for Moon it

2533.079 --> 2538.2400000000002
doesn't work forget about uh Venus or

2535.78 --> 2540.1600000000003
the other that things celestial bodies

2538.24 --> 2541.72
and that thing it doesn't work even for

2540.16 --> 2543.339
Moon which is quite big thing right in

2541.72 --> 2546.9599999999996
front of you like you know it doesn't

2543.339 --> 2549.64
even magnify it properly you know so

2546.96 --> 2552.339
that I think we miss with the space

2549.64 --> 2554.3199999999997
stuff and we don't observe is that is

2552.339 --> 2556.54
that we can see the stars with the

2554.32 --> 2558.2200000000003
telescope with the camera like we can

2556.54 --> 2560.619
bring them into Focus

2558.22 --> 2563.74
How can there be millions of light years

2560.619 --> 2565.54
away if there if I can zoom into it if I

2563.74 --> 2567.339
can see the details on it I mean

2565.54 --> 2569.2599999999998
obviously the I mean this whole light

2567.339 --> 2572.7999999999997
years concept was like a joke in itself

2569.26 --> 2575.079
I mean that was uh because that was to

2572.8 --> 2578.3390000000004
give people a sense that the prison is

2575.079 --> 2578.3390000000004
very big right

2582.48 --> 2586.96
you're expanding the prison right like

2584.92 --> 2589.839
so then people will think oh like we

2586.96 --> 2591.52
have a lot I mean if you make a like a

2589.839 --> 2593.2599999999998
sell prison cell like much bigger up

2591.52 --> 2595.54
here it's like for five feet by five

2593.26 --> 2596.7400000000002
feet actually the prison cell but you

2595.54 --> 2598.9
say no it's not five feet it's five

2596.74 --> 2601.24
kilometers by five kilometers or five

2598.9 --> 2603.04
miles by five miles then the prisoner

2601.24 --> 2604.6189999999997
feels old like I'm not in a prison

2603.04 --> 2608.859
anymore

2604.619 --> 2610.54
yeah I mean yes yeah yeah it's it's a

2608.859 --> 2613.9
it's another psychological trick

2610.54 --> 2617.02
basically to increase the at least in

2613.9 --> 2619.2400000000002
your mind right capture yourself yeah it

2617.02 --> 2621.66
increase the space in your mind yeah

2619.24 --> 2625.5989999999997
it's not increasing in reality

2621.66 --> 2629.0789999999997
but in your mind it is increasing so so

2625.599 --> 2631.0
that's it that that that's that's the

2629.079 --> 2633.579
whole point to that kind of thing you

2631.0 --> 2635.68
know so to expand our nonsense most uh

2633.579 --> 2639.6400000000003
most of it and then you go with the

2635.68 --> 2642.94
suicide escape and some people uh think

2639.64 --> 2647.14
that I think it's the easy way out but

2642.94 --> 2649.839
not so easy yeah you can extend on it

2647.14 --> 2651.64
the suicide Escape thing yes the thing

2649.839 --> 2653.7999999999997
is that again people are not taught okay

2651.64 --> 2655.0
like it's basic education right okay so

2653.8 --> 2656.8
they don't know anything about uh

2655.0 --> 2658.42
transmigration or they don't know about

2656.8 --> 2659.8590000000004
like that Spirit leaves the body then

2658.42 --> 2661.119
you have to be born again and all of

2659.859 --> 2663.7599999999998
that thing they're not taught any of

2661.119 --> 2666.819
this thing so they think okay if I

2663.76 --> 2668.7400000000002
finish this body and that's the end

2666.819 --> 2670.599
they think that'll be the end it'll be

2668.74 --> 2673.1189999999997
the end of their misery whatever

2670.599 --> 2675.76
confusion bad things they are facing

2673.119 --> 2678.28
anything they think that'll they'll put

2675.76 --> 2680.2000000000003
an end to it okay what's the whole point

2678.28 --> 2682.3
point is to put an end to it but they

2680.2 --> 2684.46
don't realize that there'll be no end

2682.3 --> 2686.26
when you leave this body you'll other

2684.46 --> 2688.119
bodies will come out and then you'll

2686.26 --> 2690.1600000000003
have to take another birth and that

2688.119 --> 2692.079
birth will be worse then what your

2690.16 --> 2693.64
current birth is so your situation will

2692.079 --> 2696.6400000000003
be actually worse than what your current

2693.64 --> 2699.339
situation is in the next one so you're

2696.64 --> 2701.2599999999998
not actually gotten out you have dug

2699.339 --> 2703.859
yourself another big hole

2701.26 --> 2707.98
you know like

2703.859 --> 2711.7599999999998
I have a question for you how can we

2707.98 --> 2713.7400000000002
do you do like I want to wrap my head

2711.76 --> 2716.6800000000003
around that stuff look the rebirth and

2713.74 --> 2721.0
stuff like I feel reborn but I mean uh

2716.68 --> 2726.2799999999997
like the reborn inflation stuff Have You

2721.0 --> 2728.44
Ever Had like manifestation like in the

2726.28 --> 2731.98
reality of that stuff like we talked

2728.44 --> 2733.06
about it that we're gonna come yeah a

2731.98 --> 2735.28
lot of things I mean you know people

2733.06 --> 2737.2599999999998
like right now in different cultures and

2735.28 --> 2739.119
stuff like I don't know like in West it

2737.26 --> 2741.2200000000003
has become less now you know when people

2739.119 --> 2743.38
used to get another body you know in the

2741.22 --> 2746.14
village and stuff you know somebody dies

2743.38 --> 2748.26
and they get reborn in the same place

2746.14 --> 2750.7799999999997
you know then the kid would actually

2748.26 --> 2753.4
sometimes remember

2750.78 --> 2755.38
you know like and and the old people

2753.4 --> 2758.14
would actually uh in those days there

2755.38 --> 2760.9
were no banks and stuff okay so people

2758.14 --> 2762.94
would hide their you know gold or

2760.9 --> 2765.339
jewelry or valuables whatever into the

2762.94 --> 2767.26
ground or they would dig a hole and put

2765.339 --> 2770.44
them in the ground okay and then they

2767.26 --> 2772.9
remembered so that the kid which is born

2770.44 --> 2774.2400000000002
it knows where that gold is which only

2772.9 --> 2777.46
that

2774.24 --> 2779.319
uh person who died that's the kind of

2777.46 --> 2781.66
stuff I wanted to know yeah the old man

2779.319 --> 2784.7799999999997
which actually you know died like you

2781.66 --> 2787.54
know that uh would uh be born again and

2784.78 --> 2789.7000000000003
then that person as a kid will when it

2787.54 --> 2791.5
reaches five six years old it can go out

2789.7 --> 2794.68
there and say hey big hair and it is

2791.5 --> 2798.099
there like you know we have a sense of

2794.68 --> 2800.319
remembrance of the prince mostly beings

2798.099 --> 2802.6600000000003
were being uh born in the same vicinity

2800.319 --> 2804.099
you know if you died in that Village in

2802.66 --> 2807.04
that area you will be born around in

2804.099 --> 2809.6800000000003
that same family group same area you

2807.04 --> 2812.56
know you don't go far than that you know

2809.68 --> 2815.5
because you are in that your whole

2812.56 --> 2818.5
spirit is in that kind of feel lonely so

2815.5 --> 2820.24
the birds are close by and uh all it

2818.5 --> 2821.8
world was not like this you know where

2820.24 --> 2824.319
people are moving all around

2821.8 --> 2825.819
and interacting with the whole world and

2824.319 --> 2828.579
dealing with the whole world where your

2825.819 --> 2830.2599999999998
uh mentality and Consciousness is

2828.579 --> 2832.54
changing all the time because you're

2830.26 --> 2834.76
dealing it is very local it used to be

2832.54 --> 2836.68
very local world and in that it was very

2834.76 --> 2838.599
easy to see these kind of things these

2836.68 --> 2840.22
events and incidents happen over and

2838.599 --> 2843.579
over and over again

2840.22 --> 2845.14
you know it was like if it was an

2843.579 --> 2847.48
everyday occurrence so

2845.14 --> 2849.22
so there are many many ways you can

2847.48 --> 2850.78
prove it actually that this happens but

2849.22 --> 2853.18
you know it's this is just one of the

2850.78 --> 2855.76
ways but you know but there are many

2853.18 --> 2857.7999999999997
ways to actually you know that like that

2855.76 --> 2861.0400000000004
this is a Russian doll kind of thing the

2857.8 --> 2864.88
whole the musical body yeah televised on

2861.04 --> 2867.579
TV I'm sure so you get it that stuff yes

2864.88 --> 2870.28
I mean uh I mean the thing is that um

2867.579 --> 2871.6600000000003
obviously uh this body is the outer

2870.28 --> 2873.28
shell just like clothes like you know

2871.66 --> 2875.2
like you wear the clothes you change

2873.28 --> 2877.9
them you take it away you put another

2875.2 --> 2880.48
clothes on the same thing

2877.9 --> 2883.1800000000003
bodies and another cloth you're putting

2880.48 --> 2887.079
this on and you're gonna leave it like

2883.18 --> 2890.319
you know it's it's not a yeah yeah

2887.079 --> 2892.599
emergency of emergence and that's a

2890.319 --> 2894.88
great one and that's what we we hear the

2892.599 --> 2897.7000000000003
sense of emergency that we have is like

2894.88 --> 2900.1600000000003
reserved for paying bills and like

2897.7 --> 2902.4399999999996
catching uh stuff that we have to do

2900.16 --> 2905.2
doing the stuff we have to do but the

2902.44 --> 2907.319
sense of emergency of uh moving out our

2905.2 --> 2912.04
our nonsense and the the the the

2907.319 --> 2914.44
psychosis The psychosis disease called

2912.04 --> 2917.2
Full uses or I don't know how anyway

2914.44 --> 2920.079
we're being fooled we're acting like

2917.2 --> 2921.9399999999996
fools we're pretending not to know we

2920.079 --> 2925.9
keep our head and so all this you know

2921.94 --> 2928.359
create that sense of erase the sense of

2925.9 --> 2931.0
emergency so you will not emerge the

2928.359 --> 2933.22
reason why I'm here I'm emerging from my

2931.0 --> 2936.04
stuff is because I see the sense of

2933.22 --> 2937.359
emerging there is there is but there

2936.04 --> 2940.48
should be like immediately I mean

2937.359 --> 2942.2799999999997
because the thing is a panic okay what

2940.48 --> 2945.22
I'll use the word is a panic basically

2942.28 --> 2948.52
you know if for example you are in this

2945.22 --> 2950.2
world okay uh and you don't know this

2948.52 --> 2951.819
world and you have no idea what this

2950.2 --> 2952.7799999999997
world is and you you are surrounded by

2951.819 --> 2954.4
all these things and these things are

2952.78 --> 2955.7200000000003
happening and whatever is happening it

2954.4 --> 2958.119
should create a sense of panic in you

2955.72 --> 2960.9399999999996
first naturally normally like there

2958.119 --> 2963.1600000000003
should be a sense of panic okay like

2960.94 --> 2966.16
because when you don't know that even

2963.16 --> 2967.24
the sense of not knowing creates a panic

2966.16 --> 2969.16
okay

2967.24 --> 2973.06
yeah I mean it automatically creates a

2969.16 --> 2975.16
panic okay like so uh so like I mean so

2973.06 --> 2978.339
one has to go with that panic because

2975.16 --> 2980.7999999999997
Panic is what energy okay

2978.339 --> 2984.599
Panic is also an energy basically that's

2980.8 --> 2986.8590000000004
what Panic is okay so

2984.599 --> 2989.98
that's also energy yeah it's all it's

2986.859 --> 2991.96
all energy right it's all right so once

2989.98 --> 2992.8
you feel that sense of panic now that

2991.96 --> 2994.48
will

2992.8 --> 2995.8590000000004
put you into action

2994.48 --> 2998.8
because

2995.859 --> 3001.56
it's energy it's a panic means you know

2998.8 --> 3003.1800000000003
so Panic is a good thing now people say

3001.56 --> 3005.7
somebody's got a panic attack now they

3003.18 --> 3006.839
consider that a bad thing you know

3005.7 --> 3009.1189999999997
you know

3006.839 --> 3011.22
but but sense of panic should be

3009.119 --> 3013.2000000000003
automatically there anybody who's born

3011.22 --> 3015.68
here

3013.2 --> 3019.9399999999996
should have a sense of panic

3015.68 --> 3022.44
used to have a big pandemic attack

3019.94 --> 3023.819
yeah yeah yeah so I'm saying anybody

3022.44 --> 3025.02
who's born here if they are a real

3023.819 --> 3027.359
spirit

3025.02 --> 3028.74
then they will have a sense of panic

3027.359 --> 3029.88
they will have a sense of panic there is

3028.74 --> 3031.9199999999996
no

3029.88 --> 3033.3
that thing because you you don't know

3031.92 --> 3035.099
you're trapped you're feeling in this

3033.3 --> 3037.1400000000003
and you're you don't know what what is

3035.099 --> 3040.079
going on and you will have that sense of

3037.14 --> 3042.2999999999997
Panic it's to use that sense of panic

3040.079 --> 3044.52
is another matter

3042.3 --> 3047.94
you have to be able to use

3044.52 --> 3050.04
that sense of panic because because then

3047.94 --> 3051.2400000000002
then you will say look then you'll get a

3050.04 --> 3052.859
sense of emergency what you call

3051.24 --> 3055.859
emergency like I have to do something

3052.859 --> 3059.04
now I have to do something right now I I

3055.859 --> 3061.74
don't have any time to waste you know so

3059.04 --> 3064.98
like yeah so if I did all of my things

3061.74 --> 3068.52
that yeah yeah yeah I I mean when I was

3064.98 --> 3070.319
17 I was not thinking I have till 80 or

3068.52 --> 3072.54
90 to go

3070.319 --> 3074.2799999999997
you know 80 years or 90 years to go when

3072.54 --> 3075.66
I was 17 years old like I didn't think

3074.28 --> 3077.1600000000003
that I think I have to do things right

3075.66 --> 3082.44
now I can't

3077.16 --> 3083.7
wait till I'm 40 50 60 70 80 or 90.

3082.44 --> 3086.099
two

3083.7 --> 3088.5
because uh out here nothing is clear

3086.099 --> 3090.2400000000002
okay human lifespan is not that thing I

3088.5 --> 3092.52
mean even if you're 17 you can die by 18

3090.24 --> 3093.66
or 19. I mean there is nothing to say

3092.52 --> 3095.3
that

3093.66 --> 3098.46
you will

3095.3 --> 3101.099
last that long or anything can happen

3098.46 --> 3102.9
like there is no guarantees

3101.099 --> 3104.94
of any kind here I mean that's also

3102.9 --> 3106.6800000000003
reality here of here that there are no

3104.94 --> 3109.26
guarantees here

3106.68 --> 3112.0789999999997
like I mean I know I'm gonna take a next

3109.26 --> 3113.6400000000003
breath but it's not guaranteed yeah I

3112.079 --> 3115.38
mean tomorrow tomorrow you you will be

3113.64 --> 3117.48
there or not even that is on guaranteed

3115.38 --> 3119.1600000000003
like you know that you know I mean

3117.48 --> 3121.26
that's the reality of this

3119.16 --> 3124.0789999999997
whole whole thing and you know like uh

3121.26 --> 3125.46
it's it's it's a very very and that is a

3124.079 --> 3128.7000000000003
scary situation

3125.46 --> 3129.96
and it's a panic like inducing situation

3128.7 --> 3133.02
for people you know like where nothing

3129.96 --> 3135.48
is in your hands okay

3133.02 --> 3137.4
yeah

3135.48 --> 3140.819
yeah so

3137.4 --> 3142.8
so people have to face that

3140.819 --> 3143.819
so it should cause a sense of panic and

3142.8 --> 3145.6800000000003
it should cause a sense of emergency

3143.819 --> 3147.3
that you have to do something right now

3145.68 --> 3149.3999999999996
as of right now what because you have

3147.3 --> 3151.38
this moment and that's all you have when

3149.4 --> 3153.2400000000002
you have to do the thing right now

3151.38 --> 3155.1600000000003
you have to figure out things right now

3153.24 --> 3157.0789999999997
and they should be as sense of emergency

3155.16 --> 3159.48
like that's why people are so blase

3157.079 --> 3161.78
about that thing you know oh yeah I'll

3159.48 --> 3165.66
do that next year not a lot of people

3161.78 --> 3167.76
I'll uh do that uh I'll start from you

3165.66 --> 3169.5
know I I think couple of years I'll do

3167.76 --> 3172.3190000000004
this and after two three years I'll

3169.5 --> 3173.819
become spiritual or I'll become this and

3172.319 --> 3176.7
you know

3173.819 --> 3179.88
yeah like yeah we have a lot of

3176.7 --> 3182.7599999999998
secondary activities and stuff that also

3179.88 --> 3185.2200000000003
takes us out of the realization that we

3182.76 --> 3187.8590000000004
have to do something now so we're busy

3185.22 --> 3190.3799999999997
gardening and washing the car washing

3187.859 --> 3193.14
the house grabbing the the outside like

3190.38 --> 3195.3
it seems to be very good yeah that's all

3193.14 --> 3197.46
uh yeah that's all uh sort of uh getting

3195.3 --> 3200.3390000000004
away from what you have to do

3197.46 --> 3202.02
you're wasting time to do the things

3200.339 --> 3204.24
which you don't have to do

3202.02 --> 3207.48
to ignore what you actually have to do

3204.24 --> 3210.359
so so so that's because

3207.48 --> 3212.4
um because I I don't think the car car

3210.359 --> 3216.54
is just metal it doesn't need a wash you

3212.4 --> 3218.46
know like I mean it it is it is fine as

3216.54 --> 3219.96
is like you know even if it gets dusty

3218.46 --> 3221.94
it doesn't matter it's just metal you

3219.96 --> 3226.319
know and it's not your body you know

3221.94 --> 3229.68
like I mean your body matters that does

3226.319 --> 3231.0
not matter much you know so like so

3229.68 --> 3232.44
people people don't understand people

3231.0 --> 3234.78
are continuously in this cleaning and

3232.44 --> 3235.8
this thing that is like a therapy which

3234.78 --> 3239.78
people use

3235.8 --> 3243.48
do not face reality I think scrubbing in

3239.78 --> 3246.8390000000004
yeah also and like the reality the

3243.48 --> 3249.72
vision reality a bit that we have is

3246.839 --> 3252.9
that we are on land like I don't think

3249.72 --> 3255.1189999999997
we're we're on on a land but we're not

3252.9 --> 3257.4
so much on them because I think we're in

3255.119 --> 3259.079
very Troubled Waters and that's what you

3257.4 --> 3261.599
see here because you come with the boats

3259.079 --> 3265.44
on the notion and I see yeah more

3261.599 --> 3267.9
drifting lust at Sea than firmly

3265.44 --> 3269.819
grounded you know what I mean because if

3267.9 --> 3272.1600000000003
you're on the land you're grounded on

3269.819 --> 3274.5
earth like your two feet are in the dirt

3272.16 --> 3277.0789999999997
and you know where that's the kind of

3274.5 --> 3280.559
stuff you experience nature more natural

3277.079 --> 3282.7200000000003
feeling but if you're drifting last at

3280.559 --> 3285.119
Sea on the notion in the old Troubled

3282.72 --> 3287.64
Waters of Babylon which is what you're

3285.119 --> 3289.92
saying here and most people both are

3287.64 --> 3291.859
leaking water and they have holes and

3289.92 --> 3293.819
you know yeah

3291.859 --> 3296.7
the boat will be leaking but they're

3293.819 --> 3300.18
still scrubbing the uh the cockpit and

3296.7 --> 3301.68
they start scrubbing the yeah yeah so

3300.18 --> 3305.5789999999997
that's a mad person I think you know

3301.68 --> 3307.02
that's Madness right like if your ship

3305.579 --> 3309.3
is thinking and you are cleaning the

3307.02 --> 3312.359
ship what what would that be called

3309.3 --> 3314.2200000000003
except Madness right like I mean

3312.359 --> 3316.5589999999997
that you've gone crazy right like that's

3314.22 --> 3318.54
all the more you don't face anything the

3316.559 --> 3320.579
more crazy you get like it's a it's as

3318.54 --> 3322.2599999999998
simple as that I mean even if you get

3320.579 --> 3323.94
that Panic if you Embrace that Panic

3322.26 --> 3326.2200000000003
it's better better for you to embrace

3323.94 --> 3328.8
the panic and actually get into action

3326.22 --> 3330.7799999999997
through that panic and emergency sense

3328.8 --> 3332.579
of emergency you know and people don't

3330.78 --> 3335.2200000000003
realize that human lifespan is not so

3332.579 --> 3337.559
long you know it's not millions of years

3335.22 --> 3339.359
you know like yeah if you have if you're

3337.559 --> 3341.2200000000003
a million million years to live then 40

3339.359 --> 3343.2
50 years you can do something 100 years

3341.22 --> 3345.54
you can do another thing another 100

3343.2 --> 3349.0789999999997
years you don't have to

3345.54 --> 3352.5589999999997
have this sense of like that immediately

3349.079 --> 3354.96
right now like you know people are quite

3352.559 --> 3357.3590000000004
uh not understanding that our time is

3354.96 --> 3360.119
very limited like it's not very long

3357.359 --> 3362.94
it's quite limited it's quite small like

3360.119 --> 3365.4
it's not so yeah come on especially if

3362.94 --> 3368.28
you like me realize all these things

3365.4 --> 3371.339
around the age of 40 you realize that

3368.28 --> 3373.3190000000004
hey life I say it after life life is

3371.339 --> 3376.5589999999997
like a roll of toilet paper

3373.319 --> 3378.54
yeah same thing like it because it's

3376.559 --> 3380.2200000000003
Gonna Roll very fast at the end so you

3378.54 --> 3383.099
better catch it and then make sure

3380.22 --> 3385.6189999999997
you're parking depart them but the thing

3383.099 --> 3387.96
is also like if we keep referring we'll

3385.619 --> 3391.26
finish with this one and that's another

3387.96 --> 3394.2
uh very good one and I think if our ship

3391.26 --> 3397.079
is leaking water if we're out there in

3394.2 --> 3399.839
the in the ocean last at Sea we're gonna

3397.079 --> 3403.2000000000003
need help but sometimes we can't even

3399.839 --> 3405.7799999999997
see the the Rope like I often if you're

3403.2 --> 3408.66
at the end of the Roper you should make

3405.78 --> 3410.8190000000004
a nut and hang on to it you know and

3408.66 --> 3413.8799999999997
then there will be people sending rope

3410.819 --> 3417.24
to you like do it so fast and stuff but

3413.88 --> 3418.92
if you like refuse the Yelp or because

3417.24 --> 3421.9799999999996
you're gonna need help to get out of it

3418.92 --> 3424.6800000000003
I mean uh once I did my own thing I have

3421.98 --> 3425.94
given people a ropes and that thing and

3424.68 --> 3428.2799999999997
I'm just seeing whether people will take

3425.94 --> 3430.619
it or not but again I've been noticing

3428.28 --> 3431.7000000000003
this for a long time and and I see that

3430.619 --> 3433.92
people

3431.7 --> 3435.2999999999997
um to even catch the Rope or hang on the

3433.92 --> 3437.46
Rope first have to admit to the fact

3435.3 --> 3438.9
that their ship is sinking okay if they

3437.46 --> 3439.98
don't admit to that like they're not

3438.9 --> 3442.319
going to catch on to it they're not

3439.98 --> 3444.0
gonna use a Lifeboat or anything which

3442.319 --> 3445.68
is given to them or you know they're not

3444.0 --> 3448.079
going to take it because they just don't

3445.68 --> 3449.7
admit to it like so once that admittance

3448.079 --> 3452.04
is there then only you can take that

3449.7 --> 3453.96
step and get onto the live port and you

3452.04 --> 3456.96
know and get to some sort of Direction

3453.96 --> 3458.64
and purpose and reality and things like

3456.96 --> 3461.76
you know for that you have to admit like

3458.64 --> 3463.2599999999998
and that is like like I'm just seeing

3461.76 --> 3466.3190000000004
like what are the things which come in

3463.26 --> 3468.42
the way of that and that's what I try to

3466.319 --> 3470.46
deal with in this in this book like what

3468.42 --> 3473.94
are the things which come in the way of

3470.46 --> 3476.2200000000003
people admitting and you know so yeah

3473.94 --> 3478.38
like one day I was navigating the

3476.22 --> 3481.319
Troubled Waters and I saw your Oakland

3478.38 --> 3483.2400000000002
I'm like hey Lotus ocean boat oh yeah I

3481.319 --> 3485.819
have to get on that boat and he's a

3483.24 --> 3489.5989999999997
great captain and you know they you are

3485.819 --> 3492.119
really doing a very Divine uh work and

3489.599 --> 3494.339
there's no doubt for me and uh and you

3492.119 --> 3497.46
are definitely someone who can get

3494.339 --> 3499.2
anyone get out of hell for sure yes yeah

3497.46 --> 3501.2400000000002
but people but again it's an individual

3499.2 --> 3503.339
decision people have to want to do that

3501.24 --> 3505.74
first I'm not here to force anyone to do

3503.339 --> 3507.599
that you know but I'm just saying that

3505.74 --> 3510.1189999999997
what all things people have in their

3507.599 --> 3511.8
psychology and mind in this plane which

3510.119 --> 3513.96
stopped them from doing that is like

3511.8 --> 3516.0
first having this idea that we have long

3513.96 --> 3517.92
to live they don't have a clear idea

3516.0 --> 3519.78
that our life is not so long here and

3517.92 --> 3522.299
which is reality like at maximum you

3519.78 --> 3524.1600000000003
live 100 years even 100 years 100 years

3522.299 --> 3527.28
is many not many people reach 100 years

3524.16 --> 3530.94
right okay and even 100 years is not so

3527.28 --> 3533.099
much it's not a long time okay it's yeah

3530.94 --> 3535.26
I mean people just don't have any sense

3533.099 --> 3537.6600000000003
of the amount of time we have out there

3535.26 --> 3539.4
it's not so much I mean and they have to

3537.66 --> 3541.819
so these are the kind of psychological

3539.4 --> 3541.819
issues

3542.119 --> 3547.38
it goes fast but also there's no

3545.16 --> 3549.5989999999997
humidity and there's no really sense of

3547.38 --> 3552.1800000000003
humidity with an assembleness and stuff

3549.599 --> 3555.119
like that so I was very Arrogant with

3552.18 --> 3557.819
life normally I'm a bit an arrogant

3555.119 --> 3559.38
person but now not so much because I'm

3557.819 --> 3561.7799999999997
working on myself becoming a better

3559.38 --> 3563.819
person but I used to be very arrogant

3561.78 --> 3565.98
and Arrogant with people Arrogant with

3563.819 --> 3568.619
life like you were talking to me and I

3565.98 --> 3570.599
was like but today I'm more like

3568.619 --> 3571.98
responding and because the more you

3570.599 --> 3574.619
realize that you don't know the more

3571.98 --> 3576.72
humble you get exact the more I guess

3574.619 --> 3578.7000000000003
today and I just shut my mouth often

3576.72 --> 3580.799
when I go out like I don't feel I need

3578.7 --> 3583.98
to talk so much and because I know it's

3580.799 --> 3585.599
so confusing it's so like you need help

3583.98 --> 3589.619
you need help to get out of hell and

3585.599 --> 3590.7000000000003
something LP help the word help has come

3589.619 --> 3593.52
from Halloween

3590.7 --> 3596.299
getting out of hell only that's yeah so

3593.52 --> 3599.339
that's that's

3596.299 --> 3601.98
you need to work on yourself and

3599.339 --> 3604.319
sometimes ability comes automatically

3601.98 --> 3605.94
the more you realize the more you

3604.319 --> 3608.04
realize you don't know the automatically

3605.94 --> 3610.319
humble you are it's it's not a it's it's

3608.04 --> 3612.18
a it's a it's a realization that's all

3610.319 --> 3614.04
it is you don't have to give a dumb

3612.18 --> 3616.74
payment to get out of a hell no it's

3614.04 --> 3618.859
it's conscious decision I don't need a

3616.74 --> 3621.8999999999996
mortgage or anything

3618.859 --> 3623.819
to get out of here it's a will I think

3621.9 --> 3627.2400000000002
will power and uh

3623.819 --> 3629.52
Clarity Focus yeah all that stuff me

3627.24 --> 3633.1189999999997
it's essential to keep getting out of

3629.52 --> 3635.04
this uh hellish trapped existent but I

3633.119 --> 3636.42
feel pleasantness because uh I don't

3635.04 --> 3639.359
know I'm

3636.42 --> 3641.76
feeling lighter maybe the heavy low

3639.359 --> 3643.44
there is nothing is getting lighter the

3641.76 --> 3645.5400000000004
more you go on with this the more the

3643.44 --> 3648.18
low because it's a heavy load what we

3645.54 --> 3651.0
carry here no problem no doubt there but

3648.18 --> 3652.9199999999996
it gets easier to carry yeah I mean you

3651.0 --> 3654.599
because you let go of a lot of that like

3652.92 --> 3656.46
so it's a process of Letting Go

3654.599 --> 3658.799
continuously like you have to let go of

3656.46 --> 3661.619
things you know continuously like so

3658.799 --> 3664.079
right so we can yeah this is enough for

3661.619 --> 3666.7200000000003
people I think in one go and we'll do it

3664.079 --> 3669.48
next time we'll take it further next

3666.72 --> 3671.8799999999997
time yeah so next we will be back with

3669.48 --> 3675.0
death and life and billionaires and

3671.88 --> 3677.4
there's a lot more and you have a spark

3675.0 --> 3680.46
or something in in me also I I've

3677.4 --> 3683.099
started to write a book myself so I'm

3680.46 --> 3686.52
gonna see where it goes but it's a yeah

3683.099 --> 3687.299
33 keys to unlock your full potential so

3686.52 --> 3690.42
uh

3687.299 --> 3693.24
um a lot into uh like the basic I just

3690.42 --> 3695.94
focus on the basic like I'm not gonna

3693.24 --> 3697.4399999999996
start writing book about astrology and

3695.94 --> 3700.2000000000003
stuff like that I haven't observed

3697.44 --> 3703.559
enough to tell you anything but I have

3700.2 --> 3706.0789999999997
observed my own Madness and stuff so

3703.559 --> 3709.26
this I can talk about it and yes Empower

3706.079 --> 3711.119
others to move out and then the nonsense

3709.26 --> 3713.6400000000003
that's more than nonsense than there yes

3711.119 --> 3715.38
yes yes and um yeah and obviously like

3713.64 --> 3716.819
if like even when you're reading piece

3715.38 --> 3718.98
GitHub and obviously the more you read

3716.819 --> 3720.7799999999997
the less more clarity you must be

3718.98 --> 3722.64
getting of different things oh yeah it's

3720.78 --> 3725.3390000000004
gonna get a lot more clear like the

3722.64 --> 3726.839
insecurities are almost uh like I don't

3725.339 --> 3728.4
I don't come here and say I don't have

3726.839 --> 3730.799
my heart racing when I come on YouTube

3728.4 --> 3732.96
blue I'm not insecure most people think

3730.799 --> 3735.48
they would die doing what I do but me I

3732.96 --> 3738.059
do it in a very natural but this is

3735.48 --> 3741.18
where I want to be also feeling natural

3738.059 --> 3742.98
like like a major three you know like I

3741.18 --> 3744.72
said that the other day I said they we

3742.98 --> 3748.079
have to get to a point where we gain

3744.72 --> 3751.98
maturity and if the tree is Major the

3748.079 --> 3754.44
fruit will be sweet but um to get the

3751.98 --> 3757.619
trees the the the the three the the

3754.44 --> 3760.38
fruit from the tree you have to shake it

3757.619 --> 3764.099
so maybe we have to shake each other you

3760.38 --> 3766.1400000000003
know to see the tree the fruit fall and

3764.099 --> 3768.119
so we can eat the fruit so you know

3766.14 --> 3770.2799999999997
sometimes let's get to shake each other

3768.119 --> 3772.099
like that's why I like to do you know

3770.28 --> 3774.7200000000003
yeah

3772.099 --> 3776.76
the acts will be a bit shaking your

3774.72 --> 3779.3999999999996
reality yeah but the point is that that

3776.76 --> 3782.1600000000003
might not be a popular thing so like but

3779.4 --> 3784.079
it doesn't matter yeah yeah yes yeah so

3782.16 --> 3787.2
that's that's fine like it's that's

3784.079 --> 3790.099
interesting part yeah yeah we're gonna

3787.2 --> 3793.02
keep taking the trees the fruit Falls
