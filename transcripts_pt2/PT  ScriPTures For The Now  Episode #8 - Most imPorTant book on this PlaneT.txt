0.719 --> 7.5
alive and direct with PC how are you my

4.2 --> 11.04
brother I'm fine fine with a p h i yes

7.5 --> 14.04
great boom we're back on that woman show

11.04 --> 17.759999999999998
with an honor with a pleasure always I

14.04 --> 19.56
feel very uh highly favored to be able

17.76 --> 22.26
to do this first of all just to be alive

19.56 --> 24.659999999999997
and so for me it's a way also to give

22.26 --> 28.14
thanks for life I'm doing something uh

24.66 --> 30.779
productive something that is uh

28.14 --> 32.399
for upliftment and progress so yeah I

30.779 --> 35.88
keep doing it for sure

32.399 --> 37.620000000000005
so yeah some honest talk has to happen

35.88 --> 40.32
somewhere like you know like it has to

37.62 --> 43.07899999999999
be I mean one place or other somewhere

40.32 --> 45.66
it has to happen you know like because a

43.079 --> 47.160000000000004
lot of forums and a lot of things but

45.66 --> 49.13999999999999
then you can't say this there or can't

47.16 --> 51.36
say that like there's all kinds of

49.14 --> 52.980000000000004
restrictions because you can't say this

51.36 --> 54.48
or you can't say that and you know like

52.98 --> 57.48
there's all kinds of

54.48 --> 60.538999999999994
well yeah Petty politics and all of that

57.48 --> 63.12
so so today we're gonna dive deep again

60.539 --> 65.7
in your book for sure we are uh we're

63.12 --> 69.24
gonna start with religion okay because I

65.7 --> 72.42
think the idea of religion is not really

69.24 --> 74.41999999999999
what what it was intended to be at the

72.42 --> 77.93900000000001
beginning if you look at the word

74.42 --> 79.38
religion religion it's like a reeling

77.939 --> 80.36
King and that's what you're saying it

79.38 --> 84.36
says yeah

80.36 --> 87.6
so I think the idea of religion has been

84.36 --> 90.42
lost a bit to the prophet of a of now

87.6 --> 92.46
building huge buildings huge Cathedral

90.42 --> 94.43900000000001
you know just look at the Catholic

92.46 --> 97.5
people the size of the buildings they

94.439 --> 100.32
have like why is such a huge building I

97.5 --> 103.2
always wonder why they have to make it

100.32 --> 104.46
so big like I mean the thing is yeah the

103.2 --> 105.72
thing is maybe they didn't build it

104.46 --> 107.88
that's the thing like they just moved in

105.72 --> 109.979
you know like if you have a structure

107.88 --> 111.6
already you just move in and make it

109.979 --> 113.82
your own like your home like you can

111.6 --> 115.439
just because uh in the most of the

113.82 --> 118.32
structures which are around the earth

115.439 --> 120.24
you know they are in cold places okay

118.32 --> 121.79899999999999
now in cold places you if you make a big

120.24 --> 124.439
structure you can never warm it up you

121.799 --> 126.18
can never heat it up okay like it'll be

124.439 --> 129.0
colder inside you know if you have big

126.18 --> 130.679
stones and big bad things and you you'll

129.0 --> 132.84
feel even colder so there's no way of

130.679 --> 134.879
heating up warming up these buildings so

132.84 --> 136.68
and they don't uh there's too much work

134.879 --> 138.17999999999998
I mean there's no actually even that

136.68 --> 140.04000000000002
thing who made it because the same

138.18 --> 142.20000000000002
people who were supposed to have made

140.04 --> 145.5
these structures are living in huts and

142.2 --> 147.42
stuff so they could not build any thing

145.5 --> 148.86
for themselves but suddenly how come

147.42 --> 151.67999999999998
they made these big structures you know

148.86 --> 153.3
that's a uh it's not uh

151.68 --> 155.04000000000002
um so it's not maybe they didn't move

153.3 --> 157.08
the they didn't build these structures

155.04 --> 158.64
they actually just moved in you know

157.08 --> 160.56
which was something already there like

158.64 --> 163.01899999999998
pyramid has always been there

160.56 --> 165.12
no no they say the Pharaoh built it but

163.019 --> 167.81900000000002
it was already there when Pharaoh was

165.12 --> 169.739
there or anyone was there so I mean it's

167.819 --> 171.66
these things have been there like so

169.739 --> 173.459
they just hide the fact like if you just

171.66 --> 174.9
go into a house and just put your

173.459 --> 177.78
decoration inside it

174.9 --> 180.72
doesn't mean that you built it like you

177.78 --> 183.48
know just so so but there's also a

180.72 --> 185.879
certain time frame also that the

183.48 --> 187.85999999999999
building uh I mean it needs maintenance

185.879 --> 190.16
a building needs maintenance some kind

187.86 --> 190.16000000000003
of a

190.64 --> 194.879
these big stone structures with big

192.599 --> 196.56
stone columns I don't think even with

194.879 --> 198.42
grains of right now you can lift the

196.56 --> 200.879
columns which are there in Greece and

198.42 --> 203.28
Roman you you can't actually this is too

200.879 --> 205.98
big the stones are too huge like it's

203.28 --> 207.9
not yeah I mean it's not possible like

205.98 --> 212.04
that people would just uh like some

207.9 --> 214.92000000000002
simple tools can build these structures

212.04 --> 217.319
I mean it's it's not even possible so I

214.92 --> 219.48
mean uh so so that thing is still open

217.319 --> 222.11999999999998
that whether these people actually built

219.48 --> 223.73899999999998
them or just moved in so you know it's I

222.12 --> 226.5
mean these can be for any kind of

223.739 --> 228.299
purpose these buildings yeah but they

226.5 --> 230.94
may not have anything to do with the

228.299 --> 233.64000000000001
Catholic thing or anything at all like

230.94 --> 235.379
you know so it's it's it's uh it's it's

233.64 --> 238.07999999999998
it's like people will try to figure out

235.379 --> 241.39999999999998
what these buildings even uh fall like

238.08 --> 244.799
so but there's an idea behind building

241.4 --> 248.04
such a huge building like if you take

244.799 --> 251.54000000000002
here in Montreal there's a nindu Tempo

248.04 --> 255.5
it's so big it and it's full of golden

251.54 --> 257.88
shiny stuff like it it's very nice yeah

255.5 --> 259.62
that is just for making the masses come

257.88 --> 262.56
in because Masters get that thing by

259.62 --> 264.36
struggling that's it yeah yeah I mean

262.56 --> 266.94
that's uh like and that doesn't even

264.36 --> 268.56
have any scientific purpose you know uh

266.94 --> 270.84
these other buildings which I have been

268.56 --> 273.0
built from the past they have some sort

270.84 --> 274.79999999999995
of like they have they taken energy

273.0 --> 276.78
conserve energy they are tuned to a

274.8 --> 280.68
certain frequency there is a certain

276.78 --> 282.71999999999997
kind of uh science behind it but these

280.68 --> 284.699
modern structures which they built they

282.72 --> 287.46000000000004
don't have any such

284.699 --> 289.979
that thing it is just for show then it's

287.46 --> 292.19899999999996
just plainly for sure and getting people

289.979 --> 294.59999999999997
to come to attracting them to come to

292.199 --> 295.86
because they worship structures so you

294.6 --> 298.40000000000003
know they're not worshiping the

295.86 --> 298.40000000000003
re-linking

298.88 --> 305.1
but the structure that they go in and

302.1 --> 306.96000000000004
that's why building them with lots of

305.1 --> 309.41900000000004
gold and stuff will attract people

306.96 --> 312.35999999999996
because we are attracted very much by

309.419 --> 313.85999999999996
material so yeah yeah so so and that

312.36 --> 316.5
also I mean but these people don't build

313.86 --> 320.04
it on any kind of sacred ratios or any

316.5 --> 321.54
of that Nano it just has to be that the

320.04 --> 323.46000000000004
modern construction is just has to be

321.54 --> 326.41900000000004
you know it's more plastic sort of

323.46 --> 326.419
construction it's nothing

326.539 --> 333.12
sort of construction so there's no big

330.36 --> 335.40000000000003
thinking towards uh about who the

333.12 --> 338.4
science of material and stuff it's just

335.4 --> 340.919
yeah nothing or ratios or anything to do

338.4 --> 343.919
with anything like so yeah it's it's

340.919 --> 347.039
just uh like um yeah

343.919 --> 349.44
a nonsensical thing it's not of any use

347.039 --> 352.86
in any way

349.44 --> 356.759
exactly after you go on with the yoga

352.86 --> 358.97900000000004
okay you there is no such thing as yoga

356.759 --> 362.28000000000003
and when I get to that page I was like

358.979 --> 365.28
oh oh yeah because you don't all also

362.28 --> 368.63899999999995
just touch yoga you touch a Shiva

365.28 --> 371.15999999999997
Krishna weather and you all say that

368.639 --> 374.88
they are without the a that it's

371.16 --> 377.16
actually yolk shiv crisp and dead so can

374.88 --> 380.759
you extend a little bit why they put the

377.16 --> 383.52000000000004
A and what it yeah I mean uh the thing

380.759 --> 385.44
is in the west when people have to speak

383.52 --> 389.52
proper pronunciation of Sanskrit words

385.44 --> 391.68
like you know uh they find it to say

389.52 --> 394.85999999999996
yoga is easier

391.68 --> 397.68
for them you know like for in America or

394.86 --> 399.36
anywhere like they found that they to

397.68 --> 402.18
say yoga is

399.36 --> 404.819
uh easier for them and the thing is that

402.18 --> 405.6
what they were actually selling these

404.819 --> 407.58000000000004
people

405.6 --> 409.259
was not joke anyways because the word

407.58 --> 411.3
term yog just meant Union

409.259 --> 414.3
okay the term meant Union with higher

411.3 --> 416.039
and divine so that was the term yo but

414.3 --> 418.979
now what was being taught in the West

416.039 --> 420.479
Was Not yoga anyways so this new term

418.979 --> 422.28
yoga

420.479 --> 425.4
suited it more because it's just

422.28 --> 427.19899999999996
gymnastics it's something else it's it's

425.4 --> 430.08
just uh turning your put your head leg

427.199 --> 432.06
up to your head and this kind of

430.08 --> 433.5
um behind your head or whatever like

432.06 --> 436.199
doing strange things

433.5 --> 438.72
with the body so it was more like a

436.199 --> 440.16
gymnastic kind of thing which West had

438.72 --> 442.74
some things like aerobics

440.16 --> 446.16
and things like that so like exercises

442.74 --> 447.74
so they just uh they thought like that

446.16 --> 451.56
is what will sell

447.74 --> 453.66
better so and the yoga pants and all

451.56 --> 456.36
that stuff how they care that goes

453.66 --> 461.28000000000003
around and yeah all of that instructors

456.36 --> 463.5
buildings uh this whole uh that thing

461.28 --> 466.08
you know like a like a person who just

463.5 --> 467.819
has to maintain posture can do by by

466.08 --> 470.81899999999996
themselves they don't need this a whole

467.819 --> 472.38
team or specific that thing to go to a

470.819 --> 474.12
certain place to maintain your posture

472.38 --> 478.08
you can maintain your posture anywhere

474.12 --> 480.9
anytime there is no home specific and I

478.08 --> 484.8
find that posture that they often taken

480.9 --> 486.84
you're good sometimes you see women in

484.8 --> 489.319
posture that you wouldn't see anywhere

486.84 --> 491.94
else there yeah yes yes

489.319 --> 494.88
yeah yeah so so the point is that

491.94 --> 496.199
obviously they're making them do things

494.88 --> 500.099
with their bodies which don't need to be

496.199 --> 503.879
done exactly we don't so yoga was like a

500.099 --> 506.699
product like yoga is the real thing some

503.879 --> 510.84000000000003
real thing and then yoga is this product

506.699 --> 513.539
which is created for certain people

510.84 --> 515.3389999999999
to of a certain place in certain

513.539 --> 516.8389999999999
countries to

515.339 --> 519.12
um distract their time with and this is

516.839 --> 521.399
a shop they'll buy it they'll pay money

519.12 --> 523.8
for it and all of that like it's nothing

521.399 --> 526.32
to do with anything real like so yeah

523.8 --> 528.06
yeah so so that's that's why and this

526.32 --> 531.48
our thing is they're everywhere like

528.06 --> 533.5799999999999
they just uh thought like it'll work you

531.48 --> 535.9200000000001
know people find it very easy to say the

533.58 --> 538.98
word yoga like all around them you know

535.92 --> 540.779
it's it's very uh and if you say yolk

538.98 --> 542.7
then they're like what is that like what

540.779 --> 545.04
is your Googling it's

542.7 --> 547.08
I've never really heard yoga I heard

545.04 --> 549.66
yoga and it's very popular here people

547.08 --> 552.0600000000001
are falling

549.66 --> 553.62
yeah I mean and that's the way ancient

552.06 --> 556.9799999999999
things are distorted

553.62 --> 559.86
to create shops in the present

556.98 --> 562.62
that thing and uh yes so it is it is

559.86 --> 564.36
part of that thing and I touch upon it

562.62 --> 566.64
and they do it in many ways all the time

564.36 --> 569.76
like and they people just need to Bear

566.64 --> 573.1999999999999
words in in the west like feng shui

569.76 --> 575.7
like they just need these trigger words

573.2 --> 577.6800000000001
like they don't nothing has to mean

575.7 --> 579.3000000000001
anything or anything they just need

577.68 --> 581.2199999999999
these terms

579.3 --> 583.3199999999999
to feel happy about oh I'm a Reiki

581.22 --> 584.519
practitioner I do this or I'm I do feng

583.32 --> 587.339
shui or I do this

584.519 --> 589.62
or Tai Chi or whatever like from the

587.339 --> 593.1600000000001
East different terms come

589.62 --> 594.66
like like so many terms come from the

593.16 --> 596.76
East and

594.66 --> 599.64
um they just become fats this is fats

596.76 --> 603.959
okay none of it means

599.64 --> 606.0
anything like so we tend to distort a

603.959 --> 608.459
lot of things here a lot of work a lot

606.0 --> 609.779
of things in America yeah for sure yeah

608.459 --> 612.0799999999999
it's called the flavor of the Season you

609.779 --> 614.9399999999999
know this is the flavor of this season

612.08 --> 616.98
it's you know this is the flavor this

614.94 --> 619.2
summer next summer there'll be something

616.98 --> 622.6800000000001
else there'll be new fad like

619.2 --> 626.22
every every summer like so it's yeah

622.68 --> 629.279
it's it's just a fad yeah I don't know

626.22 --> 632.279
maybe because we feel empty inside also

629.279 --> 634.62
we look for fulfillment outside of

632.279 --> 637.86
ourselves and places like that and the

634.62 --> 640.26
yoga centers and we get all excited and

637.86 --> 642.779
we see other people also do it that's it

640.26 --> 645.48
that's another thing you know the I've

642.779 --> 648.66
uh mined you were you talk about in

645.48 --> 650.7
there the hive mind doing all this I

648.66 --> 652.26
mean it finally comes down to the inner

650.7 --> 655.019
sincerity like if you're really sincere

652.26 --> 656.519
about raising yourself whether you are

655.019 --> 659.82
sincere about raising yourself or not

656.519 --> 661.8
like if you are really sincere then you

659.82 --> 663.0
will see through the you'll see

661.8 --> 665.0999999999999
through the nonsense you'll see through

663.0 --> 667.2
the that things okay if you're sincere

665.1 --> 668.4590000000001
if you're not sincere then you will fall

667.2 --> 671.0400000000001
prey

668.459 --> 673.7399999999999
to any kind of

671.04 --> 675.7199999999999
it's a very simple thing it's not that

673.74 --> 678.12
complicated so it's not about like inner

675.72 --> 679.8000000000001
or router that much it's about uh

678.12 --> 684.66
sincerity

679.8 --> 687.06
like yeah and would you say also uh

684.66 --> 690.06
Consciousness because I said the other

687.06 --> 692.279
day I said anybody with like a little

690.06 --> 694.1999999999999
bit of Consciousness or a conscienceex

692.279 --> 696.66
way that can see what's going on can

694.2 --> 698.94
feel what's right or wrong can know what

696.66 --> 701.399
to do in any given situation if you have

698.94 --> 703.5600000000001
a conscience yes yes and sincerity

701.399 --> 704.76
increases Consciousness okay the more

703.56 --> 707.5189999999999
sincere you are the more your

704.76 --> 709.62
Consciousness okay okay

707.519 --> 710.88
so even if you start with less

709.62 --> 712.74
Consciousness that does not matter as

710.88 --> 714.899
long as you have a sincerity you know it

712.74 --> 716.16
does not sincerely matter the level of

714.899 --> 718.8
your consciousness

716.16 --> 720.26
if you have sincerity

718.8 --> 723.12
um

720.26 --> 725.06
in that word sensitivity you have sin

723.12 --> 728.339
and Seer

725.06 --> 731.2199999999999
sincere so can you extend a bit why it's

728.339 --> 732.36
like that I like the word sin is for

731.22 --> 735.36
Moon

732.36 --> 740.04
okay sin is the ancient name for Moon

735.36 --> 743.279
the Moon the mind okay okay okay and the

740.04 --> 745.26
Seer thing you know is the seeing you

743.279 --> 748.079
know when you see it like you see

745.26 --> 751.38
something so like when you see the Mind

748.079 --> 754.1999999999999
mental functioning clearly then you have

751.38 --> 755.76
chance to be sincere right because you

754.2 --> 756.6600000000001
have your mind you can watch it your

755.76 --> 758.9399999999999
mind

756.66 --> 760.5
you can watch your own mind like how it

758.94 --> 763.98
functions what it goes what it does what

760.5 --> 767.579
it that things and then accordingly you

763.98 --> 770.4590000000001
uh are honest enough to see what it is

767.579 --> 773.279
situation is with it which and everybody

770.459 --> 776.76
can do now this doesn't require a like

773.279 --> 779.7
like some special thing

776.76 --> 781.68
to do that so anybody can do that and

779.7 --> 783.0600000000001
that from that point you will develop

781.68 --> 785.8199999999999
sincerity

783.06 --> 788.5189999999999
if you don't do that then you will not

785.82 --> 791.0400000000001
be sincere like you know you have not

788.519 --> 793.26
done that basic work

791.04 --> 794.519
with yourself which is there for you to

793.26 --> 797.459
do easily

794.519 --> 800.76
doesn't require any external agent for

797.459 --> 803.2199999999999
that so which is wait which is the

800.76 --> 805.56
birthplace of the Mind

803.22 --> 808.44
in the mind that's where the sincerity

805.56 --> 810.7199999999999
comes you know so so sin is always mind

808.44 --> 811.9200000000001
you don't understand moon sin was the

810.72 --> 815.279
term for Moon

811.92 --> 817.8
in the old word for moon okay

815.279 --> 819.18
I mean finally like if people do wrong

817.8 --> 822.42
actions here

819.18 --> 826.3199999999999
is because their mind is telling them to

822.42 --> 828.36
okay so then that will be the cause of

826.32 --> 829.74
sin right wrong sin means right the

828.36 --> 831.36
wrong action it's connected wrong action

829.74 --> 834.3
now right is that like what is the wrong

831.36 --> 836.0600000000001
action but where is the origin of that

834.3 --> 840.42
okay sure

836.06 --> 842.5189999999999
yeah here in Canada we have a you know

840.42 --> 845.519
they give they give you a number they

842.519 --> 848.16
give you a number your social insurance

845.519 --> 852.36
number and it's called sin and they send

848.16 --> 853.98
you a card and it's yeah it's sin yes I

852.36 --> 856.019
mean yeah because that word has become

853.98 --> 861.38
like the is with wrong actions

856.019 --> 864.779
synonymous with wrong action and because

861.38 --> 867.3
sinus yeah

864.779 --> 868.92
yeah but the thing is uh that is here

867.3 --> 872.399
all of this area which is again where

868.92 --> 875.279
your mind sits okay but what's also a

872.399 --> 878.22
relation with sinus cosines and the

875.279 --> 880.139
sinus of your head like is there a it's

878.22 --> 881.399
the same babe there's a sign wave isn't

880.139 --> 885.1800000000001
it

881.399 --> 888.06
the sine wave is like s-i-n-e sine wave

885.18 --> 889.8
you know like that's how uh the general

888.06 --> 892.56
uh

889.8 --> 894.18
let's say the electromagnetic waves

892.56 --> 898.4399999999999
function in this

894.18 --> 899.9399999999999
Multiverse okay so so that that uh if

898.44 --> 901.98
you take the lunar wave

899.94 --> 903.4200000000001
it will be a sine wave

901.98 --> 904.5600000000001
the way which is comes to all from the

903.42 --> 907.9799999999999
Moon

904.56 --> 910.26
towards Earth is a sine wave only

907.98 --> 911.76
and that's was connected to your

910.26 --> 915.24
structure here which is again a sine

911.76 --> 917.459
wave like even your sinus bone and it's

915.24 --> 919.44
also a sine wave everything is

917.459 --> 921.1199999999999
connected obviously like nothing can be

919.44 --> 924.4200000000001
disconnected

921.12 --> 926.699
in the Multiverse so so all those things

924.42 --> 928.3389999999999
are absolutely connected but people

926.699 --> 931.92
don't understand

928.339 --> 934.44
also so yeah yeah point is it's not a

931.92 --> 937.56
bad thing like Mind by itself is not a

934.44 --> 941.1600000000001
bad thing or a wrong thing but

937.56 --> 944.279
if it's not disciplined then it is

941.16 --> 946.38
okay so same thing becomes a wrong thing

944.279 --> 948.899
if it's uh undisciplined when it's

946.38 --> 949.62
disciplined it becomes a your tool to

948.899 --> 952.44
use

949.62 --> 954.899
so and see in England English the word

952.44 --> 958.0790000000001
is mine okay but in Sanskrit it's Manas

954.899 --> 961.26
okay so Mana says more than just a mind

958.079 --> 963.3
mind is not a complete term for that

961.26 --> 965.3389999999999
so minus means like your whole

963.3 --> 966.959
psychological makeup

965.339 --> 969.839
not just

966.959 --> 971.88
your mental thoughts you know which just

969.839 --> 974.519
come to you one after the other

971.88 --> 976.74
like so Manus is like a more complete

974.519 --> 977.88
psychological makeup rather than just

976.74 --> 979.94
your

977.88 --> 982.68
yeah

979.94 --> 984.48
I'm gonna go with it with the Mind thing

982.68 --> 988.26
but sometimes I have the feeling that

984.48 --> 990.66
the mind is a bit external of ourselves

988.26 --> 993.779
like sometimes I feel like I have

990.66 --> 996.779
thoughts but it's more it's close to me

993.779 --> 998.519
but it's not inside me totally I don't

996.779 --> 1002.18
know if you have that feeling probably

998.519 --> 1003.98
yeah because uh obviously because mind

1002.18 --> 1006.62
is not spirit

1003.98 --> 1007.82
okay so Mind Body Spirit are all

1006.62 --> 1010.4590000000001
different

1007.82 --> 1013.839
okay so like what you consider yourself

1010.459 --> 1013.8389999999999
you is the spirit

1014.18 --> 1018.8
okay so mind is still an external entity

1016.459 --> 1021.1389999999999
to the spirit okay so they have a you

1018.8 --> 1023.18
have a triangle Body Mind Spirit okay

1021.139 --> 1024.74
okay so just like your body is also an

1023.18 --> 1026.54
external suit

1024.74 --> 1029.839
you're wearing

1026.54 --> 1030.799
okay so mind is the connector of that

1029.839 --> 1032.9589999999998
suit

1030.799 --> 1034.699
to your spirit

1032.959 --> 1037.16
make sense okay

1034.699 --> 1039.8600000000001
okay so I still feel some way external

1037.16 --> 1041.1200000000001
to you like it'll still feel external to

1039.86 --> 1043.339
the spirit

1041.12 --> 1044.299
and that's why you don't call it Spirit

1043.339 --> 1045.3799999999999
programming there's nothing called

1044.299 --> 1047.72
Spirit programming there is mind

1045.38 --> 1049.8200000000002
programming right like they can do yes

1047.72 --> 1052.28
mind programming yeah they can't do

1049.82 --> 1054.08
Spirit programming you've never heard

1052.28 --> 1056.36
the word

1054.08 --> 1059.78
Spirit programming like you know like

1056.36 --> 1061.3999999999999
there is no such term like but but mind

1059.78 --> 1062.66
programming yeah mind is a thing where

1061.4 --> 1064.5800000000002
the Battleground just the Battleground

1062.66 --> 1066.559
it's the battlefield where all these

1064.58 --> 1069.62
inputs are coming at you

1066.559 --> 1071.8999999999999
all these things everything is

1069.62 --> 1074.9599999999998
coming at you and you you have to decide

1071.9 --> 1077.48
everything in that field okay so it's

1074.96 --> 1078.679
more the field playing field it's a

1077.48 --> 1081.2
level field

1078.679 --> 1083.6000000000001
it's not it's neutral that way it's

1081.2 --> 1086.48
neutral it's not plus it's not minus

1083.6 --> 1089.12
okay it is a very neutral

1086.48 --> 1089.74
field so

1089.12 --> 1094.1599999999999
okay

1089.74 --> 1096.799
the neutral uh yeah sometimes she came

1094.16 --> 1101.6200000000001
with something about this the the plane

1096.799 --> 1101.62
winner the plane of inertia

1102.88 --> 1109.22
I mean the plane we are already on

1105.98 --> 1111.14
this Earth is that plane is that plane

1109.22 --> 1114.5
of inertia we are already on that plane

1111.14 --> 1118.1000000000001
okay okay we are already on that plane

1114.5 --> 1120.28
okay so that is what you're standing on

1118.1 --> 1124.28
booking

1120.28 --> 1128.299
on it in the first place and the mind

1124.28 --> 1130.52
playing that's another plane okay

1128.299 --> 1132.08
okay so this is one plane you're

1130.52 --> 1135.46
standing on and that is another plane

1132.08 --> 1140.6
which actually is connecting your spirit

1135.46 --> 1143.24
to your suit which is your body okay

1140.6 --> 1146.0
okay so so there is a connecting plane

1143.24 --> 1148.76
to that and that is neutral so I

1146.0 --> 1150.86
consider mind as neutral okay but

1148.76 --> 1152.6
people can obviously the whole battle

1150.86 --> 1155.12
takes place there you know like right

1152.6 --> 1157.52
now uh when I'm saying something

1155.12 --> 1159.26
that will also go into the mind what are

1157.52 --> 1160.7
the people advertising all the system

1159.26 --> 1161.9
whatever is advertising that's going

1160.7 --> 1164.48
into your mind everything is going into

1161.9 --> 1166.64
your mind okay what I'm saying

1164.48 --> 1168.02
everything like and then finally those

1166.64 --> 1170.48
things

1168.02 --> 1171.86
will battle there on that field and

1170.48 --> 1173.419
you'll decide

1171.86 --> 1176.0
what

1173.419 --> 1180.3200000000002
is what you know what you like what that

1176.0 --> 1184.16
thing so yeah so is our work is to bring

1180.32 --> 1187.58
that mind Spirit body all in one entity

1184.16 --> 1189.559
not to feel it so far away from us like

1187.58 --> 1194.12
yes I feel like it's outside of myself

1189.559 --> 1196.039
but sometimes that's been integration

1194.12 --> 1197.84
there has to be an integration which

1196.039 --> 1199.82
always starts with the body

1197.84 --> 1201.6789999999999
it does not start with the mind that's

1199.82 --> 1202.8999999999999
why I always say that integration starts

1201.679 --> 1204.919
with the body

1202.9 --> 1206.539
so if you can take your body under

1204.919 --> 1210.7990000000002
control and discipline

1206.539 --> 1211.94
then the mind will follow suit

1210.799 --> 1215.78
so

1211.94 --> 1217.76
and mine is more harder to grab

1215.78 --> 1219.559
body is easier

1217.76 --> 1221.66
to take control of

1219.559 --> 1224.24
like it's much more easier so that's why

1221.66 --> 1225.6200000000001
I always say I've been saying all the

1224.24 --> 1228.32
time just

1225.62 --> 1230.299
take control of the body okay then

1228.32 --> 1232.039
control of your body and then the

1230.299 --> 1234.3799999999999
integration will happen

1232.039 --> 1236.48
all all always quite easily like it's

1234.38 --> 1238.8200000000002
not gonna be that

1236.48 --> 1241.46
harder process like it's and that's

1238.82 --> 1242.78
where people are let if people do it and

1241.46 --> 1245.059
they can see the benefits of it if they

1242.78 --> 1246.62
start doing it but that's where people

1245.059 --> 1249.86
are more reluctant

1246.62 --> 1251.539
to take control of the body like mental

1249.86 --> 1252.559
gains a lot of people are wanting to

1251.539 --> 1255.44
play like

1252.559 --> 1258.32
and you know and and the information and

1255.44 --> 1260.419
the info all of that is the mental

1258.32 --> 1263.48
realm like and people are really very

1260.419 --> 1265.039
very to go into that you know yeah so

1263.48 --> 1266.24
but when it comes to the body that thing

1265.039 --> 1268.64
that's when they

1266.24 --> 1271.52
sort of have problems like you know like

1268.64 --> 1274.5800000000002
they don't want to actually

1271.52 --> 1277.1
be disciplined in that regard dxo often

1274.58 --> 1280.46
it has to do with habits and some people

1277.1 --> 1282.5
prefer to die and change their habit so

1280.46 --> 1285.74
yes

1282.5 --> 1288.5
that's reality so now let's let's go to

1285.74 --> 1291.08
the next how to tell between fake and

1288.5 --> 1293.0
the real gurus I just want to do a few

1291.08 --> 1295.46
because I know you have to leave a bit

1293.0 --> 1298.34
earlier today yes how to tell between

1295.46 --> 1300.559
the real between fake and real gurus

1298.34 --> 1302.9599999999998
okay because there is a lot of people

1300.559 --> 1305.96
out there lots of charlatans lots of the

1302.96 --> 1308.3600000000001
people that pretend but also there's the

1305.96 --> 1310.82
people also that energize those

1308.36 --> 1314.539
charlatans because we are very unaware

1310.82 --> 1317.48
and we run towards structures and places

1314.539 --> 1320.179
like that and we see prison there and we

1317.48 --> 1323.059
think that it's the whole thing and when

1320.179 --> 1325.76
really because we are disconnected with

1323.059 --> 1327.44
nature also so if we see someone really

1325.76 --> 1329.6589999999999
connected with nature connecting with

1327.44 --> 1332.059
the elements and all that stuff we

1329.659 --> 1334.4
probably not even gonna notice it like

1332.059 --> 1337.6399999999999
hey I'm telling you there's most people

1334.4 --> 1340.9
here on Earth would see God beside them

1337.64 --> 1340.9
or the Divine or

1341.14 --> 1345.98
yeah there is a key line here there's a

1343.52 --> 1349.039
keyword to this there's a key line which

1345.98 --> 1351.14
is disconnection with nature okay so

1349.039 --> 1353.48
once you have disconnection with nature

1351.14 --> 1355.88
like you can't tell real and fake

1353.48 --> 1357.559
because real and fake is connected to

1355.88 --> 1359.2990000000002
Nature only so the real Guru will have

1357.559 --> 1363.2
connection with nature the fake one will

1359.299 --> 1365.72
not okay so unless you yourself hold

1363.2 --> 1367.28
that in any esteem unless that is

1365.72 --> 1368.48
important to you like connecting with

1367.28 --> 1371.48
nature or connection with nature is

1368.48 --> 1374.3600000000001
important to you there's no way for you

1371.48 --> 1378.38
to tell okay because that is the primary

1374.36 --> 1379.8799999999999
core root thing here okay so that is I

1378.38 --> 1381.6200000000001
mean there are other ways obviously like

1379.88 --> 1384.3200000000002
where but that two unique common sense

1381.62 --> 1386.539
for that okay like to tell like this

1384.32 --> 1388.1
person is for this I mean you can have

1386.539 --> 1390.26
perception you can tell that distance

1388.1 --> 1391.82
the thing does not make sense

1390.26 --> 1393.44
the many ways but all of them are

1391.82 --> 1394.76
related to Common Sense and that common

1393.44 --> 1396.26
sense is natural sense which need

1394.76 --> 1398.9
connected to Nature that is connected to

1396.26 --> 1400.82
Nature's sense so if connection to

1398.9 --> 1403.76
Nature is not important to you you know

1400.82 --> 1407.1789999999999
then it's well not impossible

1403.76 --> 1410.059
to and and that has to be a core thing

1407.179 --> 1411.799
and I mean it's not so hard to do you

1410.059 --> 1413.24
know like that uh to connect with nature

1411.799 --> 1414.3799999999999
or anything like that is a lot of people

1413.24 --> 1416.72
do have

1414.38 --> 1418.4
some inkling towards connecting to

1416.72 --> 1421.34
Nature like it's in their little little

1418.4 --> 1422.419
ways you know so whatever little way you

1421.34 --> 1425.0
have

1422.419 --> 1427.94
you broaden it you increase it

1425.0 --> 1430.1
you know you you have to do that and

1427.94 --> 1432.38
then all of that will be very very clear

1430.1 --> 1433.82
you know the charlatans would not have

1432.38 --> 1436.7
any

1433.82 --> 1438.26
impact on you because you can see

1436.7 --> 1440.539
nonsense

1438.26 --> 1442.82
because you have the common sense

1440.539 --> 1444.74
okay then you can see nonsense when you

1442.82 --> 1447.26
have common sense which comes from which

1444.74 --> 1450.919
is natural sense which comes from nature

1447.26 --> 1452.84
okay so so that is the key point in this

1450.919 --> 1454.22
and that's why a lot of because of this

1452.84 --> 1455.8999999999999
disconnection nature a lot of charlatans

1454.22 --> 1458.179
have been able to flourish

1455.9 --> 1459.679
in the last 100 odd years people have

1458.179 --> 1461.0590000000002
seen that because of people are

1459.679 --> 1462.919
disconnected to Nature then people can

1461.059 --> 1464.4189999999999
take them for a ride

1462.919 --> 1468.26
it's just like taking a foolish person

1464.419 --> 1469.5200000000002
for a ride because they know that this

1468.26 --> 1471.32
person these people don't have the

1469.52 --> 1474.62
intelligence or the perception

1471.32 --> 1476.8999999999999
to figure us out so I mean and that's

1474.62 --> 1479.6589999999999
done on all levels government everything

1476.9 --> 1484.3400000000001
all of that is everything is a charlatan

1479.659 --> 1486.2600000000002
but yeah but especially Luke we're very

1484.34 --> 1488.4189999999999
very blind because especially here in

1486.26 --> 1490.58
Canada in Quebec there's lots of

1488.419 --> 1492.38
Catholic church and you go into a

1490.58 --> 1494.6589999999999
Catholic church and on a Sunday they

1492.38 --> 1496.48
will pass their basket to have your

1494.659 --> 1500.1200000000001
money like

1496.48 --> 1502.94
that is something that I felt so that

1500.12 --> 1504.7399999999998
was so weird and afla the first time I

1502.94 --> 1507.26
saw it like you look at the building

1504.74 --> 1510.02
they have all this money but then you go

1507.26 --> 1512.799
and us were so blind and so unaware that

1510.02 --> 1516.559
we give it to them

1512.799 --> 1519.26
we buy the gun that's gonna run a robust

1516.559 --> 1520.7
or something there's an expression no

1519.26 --> 1522.02
because they know that people have a

1520.7 --> 1525.02
guilty feeling and guilty conscious

1522.02 --> 1527.12
inside okay so they think that people

1525.02 --> 1529.76
will give them that thing that money or

1527.12 --> 1531.1589999999999
whatever just to feel not guilty

1529.76 --> 1534.4
yeah because

1531.159 --> 1537.5590000000002
that's like buying your peace with God

1534.4 --> 1539.9
yeah you know like people think like

1537.559 --> 1544.4189999999999
okay if I do this then now

1539.9 --> 1548.0
I am absolved of things or my actions

1544.419 --> 1550.22
and so so people have this uh feeling

1548.0 --> 1552.26
and they pray on that feeling okay so I

1550.22 --> 1555.14
mean it's a psychological thing

1552.26 --> 1556.52
and the beings who are operating the

1555.14 --> 1559.1000000000001
system and I think they are more aware

1556.52 --> 1561.5
of the psychological nature of

1559.1 --> 1565.779
people and they take advantage of it I

1561.5 --> 1565.779
mean it's uh exactly yeah yeah

1566.62 --> 1573.26
the cow next the cow that's a very

1569.9 --> 1575.8400000000001
important one here and everywhere around

1573.26 --> 1578.779
here and we mild treat the cows so bad

1575.84 --> 1581.539
like they are raised into a tiny tiny

1578.779 --> 1584.12
space you see an enormous animal like

1581.539 --> 1587.299
they're big some are big and they raise

1584.12 --> 1589.58
them in tiny cages and Tiny spaces they

1587.299 --> 1592.4189999999999
have no place to walk it's so horrible

1589.58 --> 1592.4189999999999
what we do today

1594.52 --> 1598.52
so they can do the torture to that but

1597.08 --> 1600.1399999999999
then we'll come back to them

1598.52 --> 1602.12
the thing is then they will have to

1600.14 --> 1604.88
experience the torture too you can do it

1602.12 --> 1608.059
that thing but it'll come back

1604.88 --> 1609.8600000000001
to you like so so that is the but they

1608.059 --> 1612.86
don't realize that they don't want the

1609.86 --> 1614.539
masses to realize that you know so so

1612.86 --> 1617.36
which creates uh what I call negative

1614.539 --> 1621.2
kernels okay so you're creating negative

1617.36 --> 1622.3999999999999
karmas now you will be in your next

1621.2 --> 1625.52
future

1622.4 --> 1626.6000000000001
be dealing with those karmas so you'll

1625.52 --> 1628.52
have all these negative Commerce now

1626.6 --> 1630.3799999999999
you'll be dealing with these karmas all

1628.52 --> 1632.0
the time and then people are funny that

1630.38 --> 1634.5800000000002
things in the west because you know the

1632.0 --> 1636.74
cacao like uh cats and dogs

1634.58 --> 1638.72
they don't do that to them

1636.74 --> 1640.22
cats and dogs stay home

1638.72 --> 1643.659
the funny thing is they will learn

1640.22 --> 1646.76
animals but cats and dogs stay home okay

1643.659 --> 1648.5590000000002
so so cat when cats and dogs are staying

1646.76 --> 1650.72
home but so cow is some inferior animal

1648.559 --> 1652.3999999999999
which has to be tortured

1650.72 --> 1655.4
but cat and dog doesn't have to be

1652.4 --> 1658.4
dodging okay they can sit on the sofa

1655.4 --> 1661.039
they can lie in the bed yeah you know

1658.4 --> 1662.0
and uh why don't they drink cat's milk

1661.039 --> 1665.419
then

1662.0 --> 1668.12
if cat is so good then the dairy should

1665.419 --> 1671.24
be of cat and you can take dogs milk too

1668.12 --> 1673.2199999999998
you know like if cat and dog are so

1671.24 --> 1675.919
nice pure animals

1673.22 --> 1678.559
like why are they not drinking cat milk

1675.919 --> 1680.0590000000002
and dog milk I mean I I have to like ask

1678.559 --> 1681.62
that question because if they can be on

1680.059 --> 1685.039
the sofas if they can be on the beds

1681.62 --> 1689.36
then they are like almost as good as you

1685.039 --> 1692.419
I mean they they are my dog sleep with

1689.36 --> 1693.9799999999998
me yeah yeah yeah yeah so they're as

1692.419 --> 1695.659
good as you then you have to there's no

1693.98 --> 1699.38
point

1695.659 --> 1701.419
yeah yeah yeah yeah so like they I mean

1699.38 --> 1703.64
they can have cat and dog

1701.419 --> 1706.039
things like I mean but they won't do

1703.64 --> 1708.0800000000002
that like Jim saying so it's just

1706.039 --> 1711.32
lacking sense completely there's no

1708.08 --> 1713.6
perspective that's it no perspective at

1711.32 --> 1715.9399999999998
all yeah yeah and there's no perspective

1713.6 --> 1717.32
at all like the whole whole thing I mean

1715.94 --> 1720.14
and these are the basic things which

1717.32 --> 1721.82
need to be talked about actually which I

1720.14 --> 1723.2
don't see being talked about in YouTube

1721.82 --> 1724.9399999999998
like no one

1723.2 --> 1725.96
in the west we'll talk about I mean

1724.94 --> 1728.6200000000001
because most of the truth is they have

1725.96 --> 1731.059
their own catching dogs

1728.62 --> 1732.559
what about the cow mean because if we

1731.059 --> 1736.059
talk about the cow we talk about an

1732.559 --> 1736.059
animal that give a lot of milk

1736.36 --> 1741.26
cow is allowed to be free and that thing

1739.279 --> 1743.539
you know in the ancient Vedic times and

1741.26 --> 1746.179
stuff like if for example like if a cow

1743.539 --> 1748.76
is going into forest for example

1746.179 --> 1750.679
okay so cow will eat the herbs in the

1748.76 --> 1752.779
forest

1750.679 --> 1754.88
okay so then if you take even this

1752.779 --> 1756.62
little bit of that thing from the forest

1754.88 --> 1758.0
you will get all the herbs

1756.62 --> 1760.4599999999998
of the forest

1758.0 --> 1762.2
you won't have to personally go and pick

1760.46 --> 1764.1200000000001
out her because you won't even know

1762.2 --> 1767.48
which herb is

1764.12 --> 1769.58
good for you or what is what okay so if

1767.48 --> 1771.32
you send a car off to the forest

1769.58 --> 1772.399
it'll eat the right things and then you

1771.32 --> 1775.039
just take little bit of milk and then

1772.399 --> 1777.3799999999999
you'll be cured of whatever

1775.039 --> 1778.58
you have and everything because it'll be

1777.38 --> 1781.22
like a medicine

1778.58 --> 1782.84
par Excellence okay there can be no

1781.22 --> 1785.48
medicine on Earth

1782.84 --> 1788.059
more stronger than that like besides

1785.48 --> 1789.919
centering which is maybe it means

1788.059 --> 1791.48
entering like if you talk about external

1789.919 --> 1793.22
herbs as as far as herbs are concerned

1791.48 --> 1795.8600000000001
like I know people want herbs and people

1793.22 --> 1798.02
are going after that I want this herb or

1795.86 --> 1800.86
that herb well cows know about herbs

1798.02 --> 1800.86
much more than you do

1803.38 --> 1809.3600000000001
like if you send them off to Forest like

1806.6 --> 1812.24
which earlier they used to

1809.36 --> 1815.36
so these two days to Grace and Forest

1812.24 --> 1818.72
they're in Grays and feels

1815.36 --> 1821.299
so you say that drinking cow milk is not

1818.72 --> 1822.94
that bad then but but depends on like

1821.299 --> 1824.96
how the cow is being treated

1822.94 --> 1826.52
I mean I mean if you are treating the

1824.96 --> 1828.44
cows like right now and that thing then

1826.52 --> 1831.44
they'll be not anything good

1828.44 --> 1831.44
obviously

1837.919 --> 1842.0590000000002
how will that be good because it's good

1840.2 --> 1844.76
the cow milk I used to drink it right

1842.059 --> 1848.24
away from the cow me but I don't do it

1844.76 --> 1850.22
no more but I I have a friend I used to

1848.24 --> 1852.38
go there and get the the milk there but

1850.22 --> 1854.24
it's okay

1852.38 --> 1855.74
if a cow is not being tortured

1854.24 --> 1858.679
mistreated

1855.74 --> 1860.36
it's just in the open field it is just

1858.679 --> 1861.919
having grass and normal natural thing

1860.36 --> 1864.86
then it's good

1861.919 --> 1867.6200000000001
if it's not the case then it's bad like

1864.86 --> 1868.6399999999999
it's quite simple like it's not

1867.62 --> 1871.399
yeah

1868.64 --> 1873.8600000000001
wow yeah and if you're killing the cows

1871.399 --> 1876.2199999999998
then you obviously have no moral right

1873.86 --> 1879.1999999999998
to have their milk okay like that's the

1876.22 --> 1881.3600000000001
and and that you just cover pretty much

1879.2 --> 1884.659
all the parts that you you talk about

1881.36 --> 1887.0
the holy cow the two cows weighs the the

1884.659 --> 1890.24
two ways to treat cows the human with

1887.0 --> 1893.059
the barbaric women I think how do you

1890.24 --> 1895.64
describe it how is more closer to Earth

1893.059 --> 1897.799
cow is like a fractal of the Earth you

1895.64 --> 1900.5200000000002
know just Earth is same as cow the

1897.799 --> 1903.9189999999999
difference between human human and

1900.52 --> 1906.2
Barbarian demonic I loved it when I saw

1903.919 --> 1909.98
it I said this is what it is Barbarian

1906.2 --> 1911.8400000000001
demonic yeah yeah and because Earth and

1909.98 --> 1914.6
cow are similar things they're factor to

1911.84 --> 1916.58
each other yeah so cow is the most

1914.6 --> 1918.5
connected to Earth so that's why at the

1916.58 --> 1920.059
you have the sign Taurus which is the

1918.5 --> 1921.86
earth sign

1920.059 --> 1925.539
it's just known as what

1921.86 --> 1925.539
a cow God

1925.64 --> 1930.7
yeah yeah so the Taurus is the bull yeah

1929.48 --> 1933.919
yeah

1930.7 --> 1936.44
wow yeah anyway we'll have the chance to

1933.919 --> 1939.2
extend a little bit more but you told me

1936.44 --> 1941.96
you have a do this one a little bit uh

1939.2 --> 1944.659
shorter so I'm gonna let you go but uh

1941.96 --> 1947.96
yeah next Wednesday we'll get together

1944.659 --> 1950.5390000000002
again and we'll explore a bit more uh

1947.96 --> 1952.88
maybe uh bring back the cow a little bit

1950.539 --> 1957.8799999999999
and go deeper in it because I think it's

1952.88 --> 1957.88
something that we have to deeply uh

1971.559 --> 1978.08
so thank you very much uh PT and uh wish

1975.679 --> 1980.3600000000001
you the best and always the best and

1978.08 --> 1983.24
thanks everyone also watching uh live

1980.36 --> 1985.8799999999999
and we will be back next Wednesday with

1983.24 --> 1990.559
another great reflection reasoning with

1985.88 --> 1990.5590000000002
Master PT thank you very much okay
