1.56 --> 7.140000000000001
boom live in direct I'm The Truman Show

4.56 --> 8.28
with brother PT prashanti video how are

7.14 --> 10.92
you

8.28 --> 14.399999999999999
I'm fine I'm fine I'm doing fine with

10.92 --> 17.4
the Phi yes in order again to find you

14.4 --> 20.22
on The Truman Show in the tube

17.4 --> 21.959999999999997
uh today we're gonna have a better

20.22 --> 24.24
payslip with the

21.96 --> 26.939
with the book that we are doing that's

24.24 --> 28.019
still the continuity of what we did the

26.939 --> 30.42
last time

28.019 --> 32.339999999999996
yeah we're gonna start with a very very

30.42 --> 34.739000000000004
important uh

32.34 --> 37.2
word that I think is twistedly beyond

34.739 --> 38.339999999999996
recognition and is the word honesty okay

37.2 --> 41.28
because

38.34 --> 44.399
like you say in there are we really

41.28 --> 47.34
confused or we're dishonest like because

44.399 --> 50.64
once you start having a little bit of

47.34 --> 52.92
honest deal like semi-consciousness and

50.64 --> 55.739000000000004
a little bit of honesty and look at

52.92 --> 58.02
yourself you can realize like a actual

55.739 --> 60.899
Christian always told me

58.02 --> 62.699000000000005
that are deeply up you know

60.899 --> 64.379
that's what he always told me he said

62.699 --> 66.24
we're all deeply up in the system

64.379 --> 68.93900000000001
we have to realize it we have to be

66.24 --> 71.33999999999999
honest if we don't face fact and be

68.939 --> 73.13999999999999
honest with ourselves with I'm being

71.34 --> 76.08
honesty with our own being how do we

73.14 --> 79.5
ever gonna change anything here like yes

76.08 --> 81.53999999999999
so yes yes yes the honesty thing yes so

79.5 --> 83.64
the thing is that you know people have

81.54 --> 85.08000000000001
changed honesty means like you're

83.64 --> 86.88
something what you're dealing with

85.08 --> 88.56
others or the system your honest click

86.88 --> 91.22
okay if you're honest if you pay your

88.56 --> 91.22
taxes right

93.619 --> 98.759
you're honest if you are like obviously

96.36 --> 101.7
like uh being a slave to the system then

98.759 --> 103.2
that's called honesty right now okay but

101.7 --> 105.54
what I'm saying is honesty has got

103.2 --> 108.18
nothing to do with that okay honesty is

105.54 --> 111.299
actually like okay you know yourself I

108.18 --> 112.74000000000001
mean anybody can tell what they are like

111.299 --> 115.5
I mean if you look

112.74 --> 117.96
exactly what is your limitation what is

115.5 --> 120.78
the extent of your power what is the

117.96 --> 122.22
extent of your anything what is your

120.78 --> 125.04
situation what is your internal

122.22 --> 126.29899999999999
situation anybody can find that out I

125.04 --> 130.20000000000002
mean it doesn't you don't have to be a

126.299 --> 131.87900000000002
genius to figure your own self out I

130.2 --> 133.2
mean you might and not be able to figure

131.879 --> 134.39999999999998
out the world you might not be able to

133.2 --> 136.73899999999998
figure out other people you might be

134.4 --> 139.02
other able to figure out other beings

136.739 --> 141.9
but you can surely figure yourself out

139.02 --> 144.66
okay that's not very hard to do I mean

141.9 --> 146.16
that's where honesty comes in so when

144.66 --> 149.64
beings realize that limitation that's

146.16 --> 151.92
when humility strikes okay unless you

149.64 --> 153.89999999999998
realize that you won't can't be humble

151.92 --> 156.05999999999997
because you know unless you are honest

153.9 --> 158.70000000000002
about your own state or being your level

156.06 --> 161.22
which I call the level of being or what

158.7 --> 163.73899999999998
which is what is your limitation then uh

161.22 --> 165.48
you know then you cannot be really

163.739 --> 166.739
humble and if you're not going to be

165.48 --> 169.07999999999998
humble then you're not going to change

166.739 --> 172.26
from the state you are at

169.08 --> 174.06
higher because you were lying about that

172.26 --> 175.85999999999999
so then you can't change it because

174.06 --> 176.819
you're lying about the you can't change

175.86 --> 179.81900000000002
something which you were lying about

176.819 --> 182.879
already like so yeah because any being

179.819 --> 185.099
that wants to evolve that ever desired

182.879 --> 187.319
to evolve like we'll be honest with

185.099 --> 189.42
themselves I think it's a something that

187.319 --> 192.23899999999998
goes naturally like I don't force

189.42 --> 194.22
anything here I just want to evolve I go

192.239 --> 197.09900000000002
with the flu and I'm honest when the

194.22 --> 199.8
situation arise and also being honest

197.099 --> 201.78
with your honesty is a lot to do also

199.8 --> 204.3
with what you were saying also the

201.78 --> 206.7
coherency within our being will bring

204.3 --> 209.09900000000002
like the that Honesty will bring

206.7 --> 210.83999999999997
coherency eventually I mean obviously

209.099 --> 213.17999999999998
first it says first step it's a very

210.84 --> 215.099
first step if you can't do that you know

213.18 --> 216.59900000000002
like then and that's why all these

215.099 --> 219.35999999999999
so-called New Age movements and stuff

216.599 --> 221.76
like that they get credit to create a

219.36 --> 224.22000000000003
like a false identity sense of identity

221.76 --> 227.28
of yourself so you can think what you

224.22 --> 229.56
are not okay and if you think what you

227.28 --> 232.319
are not and then you will be in trouble

229.56 --> 233.64000000000001
because that's not what you are and and

232.319 --> 235.92
then you are putting this false

233.64 --> 238.379
projection on yourself and then what

235.92 --> 240.89999999999998
happens is that you cannot improve from

238.379 --> 242.819
what your actual state is because you're

240.9 --> 244.739
never referring to it they're never

242.819 --> 246.23899999999998
admitting to it because admitting is the

244.739 --> 248.94
important one you have to admit to your

246.239 --> 250.56
actual level and state okay

248.94 --> 254.879
okay so if you think you're Superman

250.56 --> 257.22
already and that thing okay so then and

254.879 --> 260.28
then you're not and you know like how

257.22 --> 261.66
people are like some people actually you

260.28 --> 263.34
know jump from the window

261.66 --> 265.08000000000004
thinking that they'll be Spider-Man or

263.34 --> 269.21999999999997
Superman kids do it like and stuff like

265.08 --> 272.58
that so and that kind of uh thing will

269.22 --> 275.1
happen like nonsense in practicality and

272.58 --> 277.08
you know you'll only hurt yourself the

275.1 --> 279.6
final result of all of that you'll end

277.08 --> 281.82
up hurting yourself yeah because no

279.6 --> 284.16
matter what's your level of honesty if

281.82 --> 287.15999999999997
you're like you things will manifest

284.16 --> 289.58000000000004
according to this they're like yeah yeah

287.16 --> 292.56
yeah yeah yeah

289.58 --> 294.0
it's a very because you get affected at

292.56 --> 296.1
Mind Body Spirit all levels you know

294.0 --> 298.02
like I mean if you jump from a window

296.1 --> 299.58000000000004
then only your body gets affected first

298.02 --> 301.5
like and then obviously mentally you'll

299.58 --> 302.94
carry the scars of that and then your

301.5 --> 305.759
spirit gets affected too a little bit

302.94 --> 307.919
because they're all connected so so the

305.759 --> 310.139
whole uh thing is like being honest

307.919 --> 311.46
about one state will create more like

310.139 --> 313.68
solve most of the problems in this world

311.46 --> 315.65999999999997
then people automatically will have a

313.68 --> 317.88
level of humility and then their

315.66 --> 319.74
dealings with the nature Universe

317.88 --> 321.9
Multiverse or other beings

319.74 --> 325.32
will go much better once that humility

321.9 --> 328.38
is there like yeah exactly can I go a

325.32 --> 331.62
notch further for sure the next one is

328.38 --> 333.6
impress okay that that one really got to

331.62 --> 336.539
me okay that brought a lot of clarity

333.6 --> 340.8
because uh I think I've been impressed

336.539 --> 343.86
mostly at people at fake idols and stuff

340.8 --> 347.1
and singers and stuff other than being

343.86 --> 349.91900000000004
impressed by the Sun by the Moon by the

347.1 --> 351.41900000000004
the nature and this should you know when

349.919 --> 354.24
you see a lightning you should be

351.419 --> 355.919
impressed and become the lightning and

354.24 --> 358.02
when you see a hurricane same thing

355.919 --> 360.24
don't see it as something evil it's very

358.02 --> 363.06
divine all storms are very Divine I

360.24 --> 364.62
think so see it as you can become the

363.06 --> 368.699
hurricane you know that's what that's

364.62 --> 372.0
how I see it so I think impressed is

368.699 --> 376.94
also impressed I'm impressed I am

372.0 --> 376.94
impressed pressed into action that's it

376.979 --> 380.75899999999996
we're blessed enough to act like you

378.9 --> 383.4
know like is pressed into action that's

380.759 --> 384.96000000000004
what the point I'm bringing uh and uh

383.4 --> 387.06
obviously what people are impressed by

384.96 --> 388.5
uh things which are just anything which

387.06 --> 390.66
is put out in the media and stuff like

388.5 --> 392.88
that whatever is turned into a fake Idol

390.66 --> 395.639
and you know those things don't have any

392.88 --> 398.639
real substance out there to be impressed

395.639 --> 399.479
by like so yeah even that are they

398.639 --> 402.0
really

399.479 --> 405.539
as I look at for me I like reggae music

402.0 --> 408.479
and I like re I I look at reggae concert

405.539 --> 411.9
or Festival sometime thousands of people

408.479 --> 413.94
and the message is some band bring it

411.9 --> 415.5
somewhere at the conscious message I

413.94 --> 416.88
would make you listen to some stuff you

415.5 --> 418.919
would say oh they have a little bit of

416.88 --> 421.02
awareness they could raise it and this

418.919 --> 424.31899999999996
and that but the people in the crowd

421.02 --> 427.38
should really uprise like if they would

424.319 --> 429.36
be that impressed at what the guy is

427.38 --> 431.06
presenting them like they would I mean

429.36 --> 433.91900000000004
but the thing is

431.06 --> 436.8
but their music is so weak and so that

433.919 --> 438.84
thing and I mean it's so I mean in that

436.8 --> 440.94
particular genre is so I mean it's

438.84 --> 443.75899999999996
nothingness I mean it's like it's a it's

440.94 --> 446.039
a sense of lulling mostly it gets people

443.759 --> 448.74
into like a sense of lulling like you

446.039 --> 451.08
know like you're lurled into a sort of a

448.74 --> 453.24
thing rather than actually like it's a

451.08 --> 456.65999999999997
very opposite of Uprising actually yeah

453.24 --> 459.3
it space it's uh like it's not uh that

456.66 --> 461.88000000000005
thing of any kind like it's it's it's a

459.3 --> 463.68
kind nothing fiery about it actually and

461.88 --> 465.539
I think it's to make it for people to

463.68 --> 467.28000000000003
like yeah say yeah there are all these

465.539 --> 468.96
things wrong in the world I mean once

467.28 --> 470.94
you smoke a joint or to every everybody

468.96 --> 472.31899999999996
who smokes a joint or two knows that

470.94 --> 477.24
there are things wrong in the world I

472.319 --> 480.06
mean it's it's not uh like I mean I mean

477.24 --> 481.74
so that that's not a big deal I mean I

480.06 --> 484.44
don't think that's anything

481.74 --> 486.36
to go again within yourself I mean

484.44 --> 487.979
they're also still putting the thing on

486.36 --> 489.90000000000003
the outside like oh it's wrong on the

487.979 --> 491.78
outside it's nothing to do with

489.9 --> 495.12
themselves right like this

491.78 --> 499.13899999999995
yeah talk about uh join cannabis is

495.12 --> 502.259
legalized today in Canada yeah yes yes

499.139 --> 504.419
yes I mean okay next sincerity sincere

502.259 --> 507.539
being sincere with our being very

504.419 --> 509.87899999999996
because I think we're very insincere

507.539 --> 512.039
also towards iron Divine we rebel

509.879 --> 514.86
against uh higher and divine and all the

512.039 --> 517.979
the great stuff that we could taste you

514.86 --> 519.539
know with life so yeah so sincerity very

517.979 --> 522.719
very important and I think we're very

519.539 --> 525.6
insincere in our uh yeah in our ways

522.719 --> 529.38
yeah I mean the word are sincere

525.6 --> 533.399
actually comes from sin Moon okay sin

529.38 --> 536.279
was the term for Moon actually okay so

533.399 --> 539.399
um so your moon is your mind basically

536.279 --> 543.0
okay and so sincerity comes from your

539.399 --> 546.18
mind actually being in Clarity okay like

543.0 --> 548.399
like where you are very clear in your

546.18 --> 553.14
mind and it's not like just fluctuating

548.399 --> 555.18
like a yo-yo like it's it's so so so in

553.14 --> 557.399
sincerity obviously creates that uh like

555.18 --> 558.7199999999999
where nothing is clear and you don't

557.399 --> 560.339
have any pure principles you're not

558.72 --> 563.1
hanging on to anything you're just

560.339 --> 566.58
thinking swayed by this or that very

563.1 --> 567.899
quickly so so there's no level of Senses

566.58 --> 569.58
again honesty is the first thing

567.899 --> 572.94
sincerity will follow after that like

569.58 --> 576.08
that's it but Seer doesn't it refer to

572.94 --> 579.36
something I see I I seen that word like

576.08 --> 582.12
s-e-e-r somewhere in the book A series

579.36 --> 584.4590000000001
someone with the yeah like which can

582.12 --> 586.68
watch thing like like a witch you can

584.459 --> 589.1999999999999
see things so yeah when you can see your

586.68 --> 592.8
mind with Clarity your own mind send it

589.2 --> 594.1800000000001
Moon mind okay it's not them it's not a

592.8 --> 597.18
bad thing you know the same way is a bad

594.18 --> 600.92
word now okay but it's just meant Moon

597.18 --> 600.92
actually sin was another name for Moon

604.279 --> 610.2
your own mind and that's

607.8 --> 614.04
um and that's what again that Honesty of

610.2 --> 616.5
seeing leads to sincerity Clarity and

614.04 --> 619.3199999999999
sincerity like yeah if you're

616.5 --> 621.72
responsible responsibility that's

619.32 --> 624.0
probably one of the most

621.72 --> 626.82
one of the most important word because

624.0 --> 628.8
uh for sure you take responsibility

626.82 --> 631.08
you're gonna find meaning with you know

628.8 --> 633.899
many people try to find meaning with

631.08 --> 635.64
life or lack meaning in their life I

633.899 --> 637.74
think it's because they don't take

635.64 --> 640.26
responsibility for their own being

637.74 --> 642.9590000000001
yeah I mean see the word responsibility

640.26 --> 646.2
comes from responsibility right ability

642.959 --> 648.3
to respond okay so anything I mean in

646.2 --> 650.22
nature or in this life in existence

648.3 --> 652.1999999999999
there is always something there

650.22 --> 655.26
which is happening no you have to

652.2 --> 657.6600000000001
respond to it okay so that is your

655.26 --> 659.22
responsibility like but especially to

657.66 --> 660.899
higher and divine nature and higher and

659.22 --> 662.399
divine you have to be able to respond if

660.899 --> 664.079
you are not able to respond then

662.399 --> 666.48
obviously you will be in trouble like

664.079 --> 668.459
okay that's where the trouble starts so

666.48 --> 671.64
a being which is responsible

668.459 --> 672.8389999999999
okay like first within themselves

671.64 --> 675.3
can

672.839 --> 677.2790000000001
have the ability to respond to another

675.3 --> 679.74
being especially higher being in like

677.279 --> 681.959
Divine and stuff like that so so that is

679.74 --> 683.279
very important I mean when you're not

681.959 --> 685.079
taking any responsibility for yourself

683.279 --> 688.56
that's what I say your responsibilities

685.079 --> 691.92
to yourself first okay not to anything

688.56 --> 693.06
else and your own ability to respond to

691.92 --> 695.6999999999999
Nature and higher and divine

693.06 --> 697.56
individually not with Society not with

695.7 --> 701.22
your parents not with anything else

697.56 --> 704.76
but that yeah exactly and it's also not

701.22 --> 706.9200000000001
react civility it's not a reaction it's

704.76 --> 708.899
response right response yeah not

706.92 --> 711.0
reaction reaction is a very easy to do

708.899 --> 713.579
people uh can I mean even animals can

711.0 --> 714.899
react okay like I mean if you do

713.579 --> 717.3599999999999
something they'll react okay that's

714.899 --> 719.399
nothing that thing you have to proact

717.36 --> 722.339
like you have to already be in a sense

719.399 --> 723.54
of action proactive action so then you

722.339 --> 726.4200000000001
are not reactive if you are in a

723.54 --> 728.519
proactive frame of being then you just

726.42 --> 730.62
don't react to things you stay with your

728.519 --> 732.9590000000001
proactivity and that's actual

730.62 --> 735.839
responsibility you know but there is

732.959 --> 737.6999999999999
that conditioning that we think I think

735.839 --> 740.519
everyone's like that me I was like that

737.7 --> 742.98
that the more responsibility take the

740.519 --> 745.019
responsibility you take the more weight

742.98 --> 746.76
you put on yourself but it's the

745.019 --> 748.8
opposite there's nothing there's nothing

746.76 --> 750.48
to do with weight responsibility has

748.8 --> 752.399
nothing to do with weight it is it

750.48 --> 754.2
actually takes off your weight if you

752.399 --> 756.24
don't take responsibility the weight

754.2 --> 757.5600000000001
will increase it'll increase so much

756.24 --> 760.38
that you will crumble under it and you

757.56 --> 761.64
you will have all kinds of problems like

760.38 --> 764.22
you know that's what's going to happen

761.64 --> 765.779
that's the reality of it you know if you

764.22 --> 767.519
take responsible responsibility of your

765.779 --> 769.139
own body for example then you will have

767.519 --> 770.519
disease you'll have all that that's a

769.139 --> 772.38
weight increasing pressure increasing

770.519 --> 774.019
it's not going to decrease the pressure

772.38 --> 777.62
actually

774.019 --> 780.6
next we go about with the gene snakes

777.62 --> 784.019
Gene snakes extend a little bit on this

780.6 --> 786.12
the sweat are called humans and Muggles

784.019 --> 788.519
Peak maybe you want to bring a bit more

786.12 --> 791.339
clarity in your muggle and speak

788.519 --> 793.019
Stephanie yeah okay you know like in the

791.339 --> 795.12
Harry Potter that thing I mean kids have

793.019 --> 796.5
read that spoken people have kids have

795.12 --> 798.42
seen that films and so they know what

796.5 --> 800.04
Muggles are you know mothers are just

798.42 --> 801.779
people who are non-magic people

800.04 --> 804.0
non-magic people they don't believe in

801.779 --> 805.86
any kind of magic to reality that

804.0 --> 808.019
reality does not have any magic it's

805.86 --> 809.639
just a mundane existence we live in and

808.019 --> 811.68
we just live in that mundane thing and

809.639 --> 814.62
there is no magic to this Universal

811.68 --> 817.26
whatever so they are called marbles okay

814.62 --> 819.0
so now the thing is that when people

817.26 --> 821.1
came to know of DNA and stuff like they

819.0 --> 822.36
were like the serpent things like DNA

821.1 --> 824.279
and stuff like the designs and stuff

822.36 --> 826.5
like that so they still did not make a

824.279 --> 828.18
correlation that there was a snake

826.5 --> 831.0
aspect

828.18 --> 833.3389999999999
like two leg beings here like like a

831.0 --> 835.62
serpentine aspect okay which is next

833.339 --> 836.8800000000001
okay so now whatever your genetics are

835.62 --> 838.139
then you have a different different kind

836.88 --> 840.12
of snakes which are different kind of

838.139 --> 843.3
genes will be like just different kind

840.12 --> 846.0600000000001
of snakes right okay that's what it will

843.3 --> 848.3389999999999
be like so so so so so there are

846.06 --> 849.899
different genetics here on Earth right

848.339 --> 851.399
now and so they'll be all different

849.899 --> 853.38
different kind of

851.399 --> 855.12
um like you can say snakes you know

853.38 --> 857.399
which are rolling around on the earth

855.12 --> 859.2
without knowing how to get out of here

857.399 --> 860.7
okay when you roll on the earth only

859.2 --> 862.38
you're just scrolling on it you know

860.7 --> 864.6
snake crawls on the ground like

862.38 --> 866.579
okay it does not fly right it just

864.6 --> 868.9200000000001
crawls on the ground okay so you're

866.579 --> 870.54
stuck here on Earth but you don't know

868.92 --> 872.8199999999999
how to get out of it like you know you

870.54 --> 874.86
you you are you're just crawling on

872.82 --> 876.6600000000001
Earth you might call for 10 000 years 20

874.86 --> 877.92
000 years so you're lying your father's

876.66 --> 879.48
father's father's grandfather's

877.92 --> 881.279
grandfather's grandfather's grandfather

879.48 --> 883.139
grandfather they all

881.279 --> 884.88
be on here on Earth and they're just

883.139 --> 887.76
struggling here

884.88 --> 889.92
not knowing how to get out of here so

887.76 --> 892.079
that's what it means like very

889.92 --> 894.779
interesting yes

892.079 --> 896.519
yeah next you go with the by jeans you

894.779 --> 898.8
go with my golden but you explained a

896.519 --> 901.5
bit what you mean by margola I'm not

898.8 --> 904.199
gonna go through it next you go with

901.5 --> 906.42
white white and this is very interesting

904.199 --> 909.66
I put a white shirt I didn't know about

906.42 --> 912.7199999999999
it I wasn't uh planning it but yeah

909.66 --> 915.779
white and it's uh look it's my skin

912.72 --> 917.519
white like I think we can clearly see

915.779 --> 920.3389999999999
the color of my shirt and the color of

917.519 --> 922.74
my skin so yeah extend a little bit

920.339 --> 925.5600000000001
because this is something we use so much

922.74 --> 927.839
the black and white yeah because uh you

925.56 --> 929.399
hear these terms so much right now so in

927.839 --> 932.519
this world like but the thing is that

929.399 --> 934.86
how people label things something which

932.519 --> 937.079
it is not it is to bring it out that

934.86 --> 938.639
people have seen the color black and

937.079 --> 940.8599999999999
people have seen the color white

938.639 --> 942.54
and they're still calling some people

940.86 --> 945.0
black and white when none of those

942.54 --> 947.279
people are that color no no person is

945.0 --> 948.54
black black or no person is white white

947.279 --> 950.04
I mean I've never seen them and that'll

948.54 --> 952.079
be alien of some sort it will be white

950.04 --> 954.8389999999999
or completely black I mean I I have not

952.079 --> 956.699
seen it as yet okay I mean maybe they

954.839 --> 960.4200000000001
see it what I'm saying is it's just the

956.699 --> 962.459
terms is this this for terms which are

960.42 --> 965.699
used in general to describe something

962.459 --> 967.68
which are not even applicable to what

965.699 --> 970.019
they are describing okay so that is a

967.68 --> 973.5
schizophrenia in the brain it creates a

970.019 --> 976.44
like a real sense of like a dishonesty

973.5 --> 978.42
within your being you know where you

976.44 --> 979.74
don't actually realize that this is what

978.42 --> 983.639
you're doing you know like you were

979.74 --> 984.779
actually creating a problem by saying

983.639 --> 986.16
this is white when it's this is not

984.779 --> 988.26
white you're saying this black one is

986.16 --> 989.579
not black okay this is this has to be

988.26 --> 991.5
removed from everything so this is just

989.579 --> 994.68
an example I gave because it's so

991.5 --> 997.019
prevalent you know so so it's it's a

994.68 --> 998.9399999999999
yeah and again it's not because when you

997.019 --> 1001.399
see white you're in confusion you know

998.94 --> 1004.1
what's white so what you just dishonest

1001.399 --> 1005.899
with everything yeah yeah I mean it's

1004.1 --> 1007.4590000000001
like you're not applying anything it's

1005.899 --> 1009.019
just if you hear a word and that's a

1007.459 --> 1012.1389999999999
word which is commonly used you just use

1009.019 --> 1013.88
it because that's what it is it is used

1012.139 --> 1015.5
and you never pay attention yourself it

1013.88 --> 1018.139
shows how little attention people have

1015.5 --> 1020.48
how little they observe anything so

1018.139 --> 1022.279
observation power is absolutely zero

1020.48 --> 1023.54
like it means your eyes are not saying

1022.279 --> 1025.939
you have eyes

1023.54 --> 1027.62
but they are not looking you are

1025.939 --> 1029.8390000000002
practically blind

1027.62 --> 1032.8999999999999
for all intents and purposes actually

1029.839 --> 1035.059
like you are totally blind and your eyes

1032.9 --> 1036.799
are there but they're not there so

1035.059 --> 1038.299
that's why that when you say the term

1036.799 --> 1040.339
blind it doesn't mean that person is

1038.299 --> 1042.559
like can't really see it's like you

1040.339 --> 1046.6399999999999
can't see while having eyes that's

1042.559 --> 1048.9189999999999
exactly and often I do that exercise I

1046.64 --> 1051.679
become very very observant and like the

1048.919 --> 1053.6000000000001
other day I was at the store and I was

1051.679 --> 1055.52
here on we're on The Truman Show with

1053.6 --> 1057.62
Rosen talking about the 88

1055.52 --> 1062.12
constellations and I get to the store

1057.62 --> 1065.1789999999999
total 808 at 17 17. I notice it right

1062.12 --> 1067.28
away I see eights everywhere the girl at

1065.179 --> 1070.1000000000001
the cash like this is all on shock like

1067.28 --> 1072.08
you notice that stuff but I said yeah

1070.1 --> 1076.9399999999998
that's observation you know what I'm

1072.08 --> 1078.74
saying like people do yeah yes yes and

1076.94 --> 1082.4
that is signs also it's not just an

1078.74 --> 1085.58
observation it kind of a Empower also

1082.4 --> 1087.5590000000002
the the journey to reality because

1085.58 --> 1090.26
that's released to reality honesty real

1087.559 --> 1093.02
reality

1090.26 --> 1095.419
someone was asking me about that in the

1093.02 --> 1097.6399999999999
comment they said ask prashan to extend

1095.419 --> 1100.4
a little bit on that stuff numbers

1097.64 --> 1103.2800000000002
reappearing like one one like the what I

1100.4 --> 1106.16
told you I go to the store 808 17 17.

1103.28 --> 1108.5
what does that mean synchronicity

1106.16 --> 1110.299
synchronicity that means like if you're

1108.5 --> 1113.299
becoming conscious and you're becoming

1110.299 --> 1115.039
more aware that means you are of

1113.299 --> 1118.16
starting to observe the rhythms and

1115.039 --> 1120.919
patterns then you are ready for a change

1118.16 --> 1123.6200000000001
that means you are starting on a like a

1120.919 --> 1125.539
cycle of change from your old sense of

1123.62 --> 1127.82
being which was unobservant a

1125.539 --> 1130.64
nonsensical like just in the system like

1127.82 --> 1132.02
let's say like from the mother world you

1130.64 --> 1135.919
are trying to transition into Magic

1132.02 --> 1138.32
World so so it is just a journey on that

1135.919 --> 1140.72
like it's just starting points little

1138.32 --> 1143.24
points on the journey like that's this

1140.72 --> 1145.1000000000001
okay because the I guess that the more

1143.24 --> 1147.02
you go on on the journey the more put

1145.1 --> 1150.32
and the more bigger the sign you will

1147.02 --> 1152.0
begin at one point they like you're

1150.32 --> 1155.24
gonna do it with the lightning and the

1152.0 --> 1157.88
stuff I mean yeah yeah does anyone have

1155.24 --> 1160.039
the capability the possibility or the

1157.88 --> 1162.6200000000001
capability by capability comes with

1160.039 --> 1165.14
practice but the possibility to do like

1162.62 --> 1167.1789999999999
you do like to to control the internet

1165.14 --> 1171.2
and stuff or it's just giving them a

1167.179 --> 1173.8400000000001
certain amount of it I mean there are

1171.2 --> 1176.1200000000001
um all beings all over this Multiverse

1173.84 --> 1179.9599999999998
which have that ability because they are

1176.12 --> 1181.76
at that level okay and stuff okay uh but

1179.96 --> 1183.2
whether they are going to be born here

1181.76 --> 1186.08
on Earth right now that's another matter

1183.2 --> 1187.88
or not like okay so so it's not like the

1186.08 --> 1189.9189999999999
beings don't exist the beings exist like

1187.88 --> 1191.7800000000002
that but whether they are born on Earth

1189.919 --> 1194.179
here right now that's not the thing so

1191.78 --> 1195.5
whenever you see a being who can't do

1194.179 --> 1197.48
that then only I'll say okay something

1195.5 --> 1199.16
on Earth is also there who can do that

1197.48 --> 1201.44
yeah there's nothing to speculate I

1199.16 --> 1204.44
don't like to speculate in this like you

1201.44 --> 1206.96
go by what is what real really is at

1204.44 --> 1208.46
that time and that's it you know like I

1206.96 --> 1211.22
mean obviously beings like that exist

1208.46 --> 1212.96
they're called rishis but that that's

1211.22 --> 1216.679
you know universe is a big huge place

1212.96 --> 1219.919
okay Earth is like a very small little

1216.679 --> 1221.7800000000002
part of it okay it's like so like for

1219.919 --> 1225.8600000000001
them to be here that might not be the

1221.78 --> 1227.08
case right now so okay after you go on

1225.86 --> 1230.059
with

1227.08 --> 1232.6399999999999
him and that's something that's a

1230.059 --> 1234.02
pretense that a lot of people have

1232.64 --> 1236.179
literally that they say they are

1234.02 --> 1238.6399999999999
vegetarian but they don't have the

1236.179 --> 1240.44
vegetarian lifestyle like you say in

1238.64 --> 1243.38
there it's important to have that

1240.44 --> 1246.3200000000002
coherency the lifestyle and the heating

1243.38 --> 1248.0
habit maybe yeah I mean the thing is

1246.32 --> 1249.74
what happens is that people when they

1248.0 --> 1252.08
become vegetarian they think it's uh

1249.74 --> 1253.58
that they can just that is something to

1252.08 --> 1257.0
do with what they put in their mouth

1253.58 --> 1258.86
okay that's all okay so there is a thing

1257.0 --> 1260.0
which you put in their mouth but there

1258.86 --> 1264.08
is something you put in through your

1260.0 --> 1266.0
ears too okay like okay now like I mean

1264.08 --> 1267.5
which is like music and sound and things

1266.0 --> 1269.539
like that and stuff which you put in

1267.5 --> 1270.86
through so you supposedly vegetarian

1269.539 --> 1274.039
okay which you're putting vegetarian

1270.86 --> 1275.84
food in your mouth okay and then you're

1274.039 --> 1277.82
listening to music which is made by

1275.84 --> 1280.28
people who eat meat right

1277.82 --> 1281.6
so so in that kind of thing so then you

1280.28 --> 1285.02
are actually getting that same vibration

1281.6 --> 1286.9399999999998
in a different form like you you you

1285.02 --> 1289.1589999999999
don't understand that but you are

1286.94 --> 1291.14
actually getting that so there are we

1289.159 --> 1294.5
have a lot of Senses what we see

1291.14 --> 1296.9
okay what we hear what we touch whom we

1294.5 --> 1299.6
interact with okay what do we do you

1296.9 --> 1301.8200000000002
know like so people uh and are not uh

1299.6 --> 1304.039
wasted in in that kind of strictness you

1301.82 --> 1305.12
know they're starting first steps with

1304.039 --> 1306.679
just what they put into their mouth

1305.12 --> 1308.84
which is also good step in the sense

1306.679 --> 1311.3600000000001
that it's some step like a first step

1308.84 --> 1313.4599999999998
but it means much more than that it

1311.36 --> 1314.539
means a whole lot about what you speak

1313.46 --> 1316.3400000000001
as well

1314.539 --> 1318.679
that you don't talk rubbish from your

1316.34 --> 1319.8799999999999
mouth okay it's not just what you put

1318.679 --> 1324.44
into your mouth and what comes out of

1319.88 --> 1325.24
your mouth too okay okay so and so yeah

1324.44 --> 1329.1200000000001
yeah

1325.24 --> 1331.94
that lifestyle can be done by just the

1329.12 --> 1334.2199999999998
being self-realizing day after day and

1331.94 --> 1336.74
just getting to that point also that

1334.22 --> 1340.58
because it's like a purge like when you

1336.74 --> 1342.6200000000001
go from a non-vegetarian lifestyle to a

1340.58 --> 1344.539
vegetarian like like you're gonna do a

1342.62 --> 1346.8799999999999
purge and you're a bit so it's not gonna

1344.539 --> 1348.559
happen from one day to another so yeah

1346.88 --> 1351.0200000000002
but it is more of a question of decision

1348.559 --> 1352.46
how strong is your decision exactly the

1351.02 --> 1354.02
whole point is the more strong your

1352.46 --> 1356.059
decision is the more you can do it more

1354.02 --> 1357.5
quickly and then like like that that

1356.059 --> 1359.6
thing could be much faster depends on

1357.5 --> 1362.12
how strong your decision is about the

1359.6 --> 1363.6789999999999
whole thing like how much are you really

1362.12 --> 1365.7199999999998
really wanting to be or you're just

1363.679 --> 1366.799
doing it like lightly like or just like

1365.72 --> 1369.14
oh

1366.799 --> 1371.0
like okay but not so not so disciplined

1369.14 --> 1372.7990000000002
like this much discipline like I just

1371.0 --> 1374.6
want this much to spin I don't yeah that

1372.799 --> 1375.799
is enough for me like you don't want the

1374.6 --> 1378.1999999999998
whole thing you don't want the whole

1375.799 --> 1381.08
complete thing you want just a little

1378.2 --> 1383.0
piece of the thing but that kind of

1381.08 --> 1384.1399999999999
thing will never work it'll uh like

1383.0 --> 1385.64
that's what creates problems like

1384.14 --> 1387.38
sometimes you will be like that other

1385.64 --> 1389.0590000000002
times you'll change and all kinds of

1387.38 --> 1391.72
things will happen it's it's never going

1389.059 --> 1394.34
to stand a test of time let's say like

1391.72 --> 1396.26
that's not good yeah that's very true

1394.34 --> 1398.8999999999999
because I went to Vancouver I was 19

1396.26 --> 1401.6
years old I came back from there seven

1398.9 --> 1403.88
years vegetarian but then I didn't have

1401.6 --> 1406.28
the vegetarian lifestyle at all I was

1403.88 --> 1409.7
just eating habit and stuff I think just

1406.28 --> 1411.62
mostly because uh yeah I love animals I

1409.7 --> 1413.72
love animals for sure I want I care

1411.62 --> 1416.6
about the animals so to me was that

1413.72 --> 1419.84
common sense but also I didn't have the

1416.6 --> 1423.1999999999998
lifestyle so it was very degenerative I

1419.84 --> 1425.8999999999999
mean yeah yeah and I ended up eating

1423.2 --> 1427.7
meat back again yes yes it will happen

1425.9 --> 1429.799
because the thing is not holistic

1427.7 --> 1431.72
because everything has to be holistic I

1429.799 --> 1434.299
mean even if you do something small if

1431.72 --> 1436.34
you do it in a holistic manner then it

1434.299 --> 1438.9189999999999
takes through time it goes through time

1436.34 --> 1441.02
and like time cannot change that okay

1438.919 --> 1442.8200000000002
but other things you know when you have

1441.02 --> 1444.26
this like one part and you just want to

1442.82 --> 1446.4189999999999
do one little discipline and nothing

1444.26 --> 1448.1
else and everything you want to keep the

1446.419 --> 1449.539
same rest okay I'm going to change this

1448.1 --> 1452.0
this aspect of my life just this much

1449.539 --> 1454.64
just that much and that's it and nothing

1452.0 --> 1456.32
else not my being I will not like Center

1454.64 --> 1458.659
myself I will not speak the right things

1456.32 --> 1460.76
I'll not do other disciplines which are

1458.659 --> 1462.7990000000002
required along with it then you those

1460.76 --> 1465.98
things cannot last for anyone any being

1462.799 --> 1468.62
so it didn't work for me anyway I ended

1465.98 --> 1471.74
up back now they turned back into they

1468.62 --> 1473.8999999999999
say oh it's not working for me uh and uh

1471.74 --> 1476.539
they like a lot of people turn into meat

1473.9 --> 1479.0
back and you know and so so it's it's

1476.539 --> 1480.44
it's uh that thing and uh the even the

1479.0 --> 1482.059
vegans and stuff like this people are

1480.44 --> 1483.679
coming and saying look look how sick I

1482.059 --> 1485.48
got because you don't know what to eat

1483.679 --> 1487.159
anyways

1485.48 --> 1488.84
so you know you become vegan but you

1487.159 --> 1490.4
don't know what to eat and then like you

1488.84 --> 1492.5
you say that you become sick and all of

1490.4 --> 1494.0590000000002
that kind of thing is because it's a

1492.5 --> 1496.52
lack of learning attitude actually like

1494.059 --> 1498.02
even after vegan it's like uh there are

1496.52 --> 1499.76
things in the west which are given to

1498.02 --> 1501.799
people okay this this is vegan food now

1499.76 --> 1503.6
it's a whole industry which is giving

1501.799 --> 1505.8799999999999
you a certain kind of food and diet in

1503.6 --> 1508.52
the name of vegan okay and people are

1505.88 --> 1511.3400000000001
just like mindlessly just using that and

1508.52 --> 1512.6
that thing so it's given to them in that

1511.34 --> 1513.98
thing so they don't have to research

1512.6 --> 1516.3799999999999
they don't have to find out what actual

1513.98 --> 1519.74
vegetarian diet or vegan diet should be

1516.38 --> 1522.5
because is this term even vegan is also

1519.74 --> 1524.36
like a strange term because uh the thing

1522.5 --> 1526.22
is this vegetarian only like they can

1524.36 --> 1527.24
say non-dairy you're not using Dairy

1526.22 --> 1530.059
okay but you're still vegetarian

1527.24 --> 1532.039
basically you're vegetarian and then the

1530.059 --> 1533.059
word vegetarian then it'll go to India

1532.039 --> 1535.1589999999999
because India was the primarily

1533.059 --> 1536.72
vegetable country like as a whole so

1535.159 --> 1538.8200000000002
that's the place where you learn from

1536.72 --> 1540.799
but when you use the term vegan it

1538.82 --> 1543.559
disconnects you from the Indian

1540.799 --> 1544.94
that things because it's a new thing now

1543.559 --> 1547.279
like in the west everything has to be

1544.94 --> 1549.2
new new so like veganism is basically

1547.279 --> 1550.7
vegetarianism only like you can just say

1549.2 --> 1553.76
non-dairy that's it

1550.7 --> 1556.46
yeah but but but but but but it's still

1553.76 --> 1558.799
westernism only so making up these terms

1556.46 --> 1561.2
creates confusion and it takes people

1558.799 --> 1563.48
away from actual

1561.2 --> 1565.94
like what they have to actually like

1563.48 --> 1568.52
which is the final basic point of it you

1565.94 --> 1571.3400000000001
know it like just these terms deviate

1568.52 --> 1574.1
from that like yeah yeah and what about

1571.34 --> 1577.279
people what's your thoughts on people

1574.1 --> 1580.1
that are like have no other resources

1577.279 --> 1582.74
like think about the Inuit up North Area

1580.1 --> 1584.6589999999999
obviously I mean they'll have to they'll

1582.74 --> 1586.039
have to live like that they have to like

1584.659 --> 1588.8600000000001
get the fish and eat like that there's

1586.039 --> 1591.08
no other way okay okay yeah yeah that

1588.86 --> 1592.6399999999999
they have to do that okay only thing was

1591.08 --> 1593.48
that people were not supposed to live in

1592.64 --> 1597.14
those

1593.48 --> 1599.299
but human beings okay that's the other

1597.14 --> 1601.5800000000002
part okay I mean uh because the thing is

1599.299 --> 1602.9
I mean finally like uh but like what

1601.58 --> 1603.62
used to happen is like Wars used to

1602.9 --> 1605.1200000000001
happen

1603.62 --> 1606.86
in different places and then people used

1605.12 --> 1609.4399999999998
to run away into more hostile

1606.86 --> 1611.4799999999998
environments like mountains or that

1609.44 --> 1615.559
thing to run away from the war you know

1611.48 --> 1617.299
or to or service regions and uh then out

1615.559 --> 1620.12
of fear they got stuck there once they

1617.299 --> 1622.1589999999999
lived five ten years and they didn't

1620.12 --> 1623.9599999999998
know the war is over or not over but

1622.159 --> 1627.2
they are too afraid to go back

1623.96 --> 1629.48
to find out whether it's over or not or

1627.2 --> 1631.76
maybe the Conqueror has taken over the

1629.48 --> 1633.44
lands and they don't want to that thing

1631.76 --> 1635.539
so that's how people got stuck in these

1633.44 --> 1637.48
kind of parts I mean no human being

1635.539 --> 1641.12
should be living in like minus 20 or

1637.48 --> 1644.299
minus 30 or these kind of uh things like

1641.12 --> 1645.86
that's not like uh like human body is

1644.299 --> 1647.6
not made for that like you know we are

1645.86 --> 1649.58
not polar bears and

1647.6 --> 1653.6589999999999
um anything like that which can actually

1649.58 --> 1655.9399999999998
live it has a skin like that itself to

1653.659 --> 1659.0
to live in that kind of environment like

1655.94 --> 1660.919
so yes so even my dog has a fur and she

1659.0 --> 1663.74
doesn't like minus twinning she doesn't

1660.919 --> 1667.64
she doesn't want to go outside yes yes

1663.74 --> 1669.74
yes so next you go with eval love love

1667.64 --> 1673.5800000000002
is a big word love is a big word but I

1669.74 --> 1675.919
think again over use and miss a lot of

1673.58 --> 1678.9189999999999
misconception around it maybe you can

1675.919 --> 1681.3200000000002
bring a bit more a light to it I mean

1678.919 --> 1683.659
it's a very simple thing I mean if in

1681.32 --> 1685.76
love is for yourself first and that you

1683.659 --> 1687.0200000000002
won't evolve okay if you will love

1685.76 --> 1688.8799999999999
yourself you would want to evolve that's

1687.02 --> 1692.299
a very simple thing that's that thing

1688.88 --> 1694.22
and that is the beginning of love and uh

1692.299 --> 1696.62
ending of Love basically because if

1694.22 --> 1698.3600000000001
you're evolving yourself then you set up

1696.62 --> 1701.36
a good example for others around you

1698.36 --> 1703.82
automatically right and if they want to

1701.36 --> 1706.2199999999998
take that or get that from you then

1703.82 --> 1707.84
there is a love there and through that

1706.22 --> 1709.76
love others they want to

1707.84 --> 1711.799
which is was basically your own love for

1709.76 --> 1717.08
yourself first

1711.799 --> 1719.299
which is a very very natural process of

1717.08 --> 1721.52
being on earth like it's not that

1719.299 --> 1724.0
complicated to process our life but we

1721.52 --> 1728.779
make it so complicated and so unnatural

1724.0 --> 1731.419
like I mean Life Is Life and I if you

1728.779 --> 1734.419
use your biological equipment and your

1731.419 --> 1736.64
senses and then like you yes it's gonna

1734.419 --> 1740.2990000000002
make great sense of everything even less

1736.64 --> 1742.3400000000001
yes I mean but yeah love is again was

1740.299 --> 1744.44
used so much in a way which to trap

1742.34 --> 1746.36
people more it's a term to trap people

1744.44 --> 1747.919
okay like so people say if you love me

1746.36 --> 1749.24
then you can't do this or you will do

1747.919 --> 1751.64
this or you won't do that or whatever

1749.24 --> 1754.34
like it's a like it's a trapping device

1751.64 --> 1756.679
which is being used right now as a whole

1754.34 --> 1759.6789999999999
like you know to to that thing you know

1756.679 --> 1760.94
like like so it's it's a it's a uh way

1759.679 --> 1764.539
where people are trying to own other

1760.94 --> 1766.8200000000002
people like create ownership when the

1764.539 --> 1770.24
natural law is that no being can own

1766.82 --> 1772.039
another being okay that's a fact okay of

1770.24 --> 1776.1200000000001
the Multiverse and it'll always be it's

1772.039 --> 1781.82
a pure principle Okay so so and also

1776.12 --> 1784.58
when you see I love you I love you I and

1781.82 --> 1786.559
view so shouldn't love be associated

1784.58 --> 1790.1589999999999
with a clear sight

1786.559 --> 1793.279
about life like it when you say I the

1790.159 --> 1794.96
eye view if your eye can view you know I

1793.279 --> 1796.399
don't know yeah yeah I mean obviously

1794.96 --> 1798.38
people are not viewing anything not

1796.399 --> 1800.7199999999998
themselves not others anything properly

1798.38 --> 1802.159
so there's no question of any love like

1800.72 --> 1803.96
like you know like or that's why

1802.159 --> 1805.7600000000002
evolution is not happening I mean if you

1803.96 --> 1807.98
look at this whole world most people are

1805.76 --> 1811.1
not evolving okay like that is the

1807.98 --> 1813.14
reality of it Mass majority and uh the

1811.1 --> 1816.6789999999999
word love is just being used as a trap

1813.14 --> 1818.0
to own actually it's an attempt whenever

1816.679 --> 1820.46
someone tries to own another being they

1818.0 --> 1823.22
say that I love that like that's the

1820.46 --> 1825.6200000000001
fact of it yeah that's yeah yeah the

1823.22 --> 1827.659
love is in people's heart is very and I

1825.62 --> 1829.779
was like that it's not for ire and

1827.659 --> 1832.159
divine praising and Sovereign

1829.779 --> 1834.919
it's the love songs you know the love

1832.159 --> 1837.2600000000002
song are so important people uh like or

1834.919 --> 1840.0800000000002
Mesmerize I think by that kind of stuff

1837.26 --> 1841.94
the love song this is a very low level

1840.08 --> 1843.26
ownership thing but see with higher end

1841.94 --> 1844.5800000000002
Divine it actually gets tested because

1843.26 --> 1846.679
you are dealing with something more than

1844.58 --> 1848.4189999999999
yourself then how much love you have

1846.679 --> 1850.52
actually gets tested I mean you you know

1848.419 --> 1851.6000000000001
that's where and because that's the only

1850.52 --> 1853.8799999999999
thing which is everyone is going to

1851.6 --> 1855.6789999999999
evolve you actually evolve you like you

1853.88 --> 1856.64
know like it's other things are not

1855.679 --> 1858.6200000000001
gonna

1856.64 --> 1860.3600000000001
um I mean evolve like I mean like that

1858.62 --> 1862.279
that is like you care for something it's

1860.36 --> 1863.539
different from love okay like okay you

1862.279 --> 1865.88
might care for this or you might care

1863.539 --> 1868.279
for that but that's just scared okay

1865.88 --> 1869.179
that's different from like evolving love

1868.279 --> 1872.6
like

1869.179 --> 1875.419
yeah another word like love is free you

1872.6 --> 1877.58
know free Freedom the the idea of free

1875.419 --> 1881.179
of Freedom Financial Freedom or whatever

1877.58 --> 1883.039
it is kind of freedom but I like you say

1881.179 --> 1885.98
today it makes a lot more sense to me

1883.039 --> 1889.52
that the real freedom I can probably

1885.98 --> 1891.919
sense or live or feel I don't know what

1889.52 --> 1894.98
that stage where how am I gonna be but

1891.919 --> 1897.14
it's when I exit this realm and access a

1894.98 --> 1899.6
higher realm or something because

1897.14 --> 1901.46
because this this is a like a prison

1899.6 --> 1902.84
thing in anyways you are caught in a

1901.46 --> 1905.72
prison okay there's no question of

1902.84 --> 1908.299
freedom in a prison right okay you you

1905.72 --> 1910.039
you you are like trapped okay like so

1908.299 --> 1911.72
you'll be taking birth over and over and

1910.039 --> 1913.94
over again here over and over the same

1911.72 --> 1915.38
cycle like zero to Nineteen Hundred and

1913.94 --> 1917.3600000000001
then back in zero to Nineteen Hundred

1915.38 --> 1920.5390000000002
and nothing you're not escaping anything

1917.36 --> 1923.7199999999998
okay so then the word free means nothing

1920.539 --> 1925.76
like what free like I mean you know like

1923.72 --> 1926.8990000000001
even out there like people if they think

1925.76 --> 1928.34
that they have this thing or they can

1926.899 --> 1929.9599999999998
move it from here to there sometimes

1928.34 --> 1931.58
okay I mean that is is also very

1929.96 --> 1933.679
restricted out there you know you need

1931.58 --> 1935.72
visa and all of that to move from here

1933.679 --> 1938.48
to there or anything like that okay I

1935.72 --> 1942.14
mean uh there is uh hardly any freedom

1938.48 --> 1944.0
within this prison also for people like

1942.14 --> 1945.44
like I mean you can't go this is

1944.0 --> 1948.679
restricted that is restricted nothing

1945.44 --> 1951.3200000000002
you can't do you can't do like like the

1948.679 --> 1953.779
the whole thing is very very restricted

1951.32 --> 1954.98
so people don't understand that like

1953.779 --> 1958.159
just because they can speak whatever

1954.98 --> 1960.14
nonsense they want to speak or uh like

1958.159 --> 1962.2990000000002
put their body in any kind of way they

1960.14 --> 1964.8200000000002
want to they consider that freedom okay

1962.299 --> 1966.679
that's not Freedom okay like and there

1964.82 --> 1968.72
and there comes the Freedom Fighters

1966.679 --> 1971.24
yeah yeah that that means that's just

1968.72 --> 1974.72
misuse of little bit of uh Free Will

1971.24 --> 1977.0
you've got okay yeah whatever little uh

1974.72 --> 1979.039
you have right now and you misusing that

1977.0 --> 1981.26
so what that what they'll do is that

1979.039 --> 1983.84
it'll tell you Freedom more

1981.26 --> 1986.84
that whatever little you have you that

1983.84 --> 1989.12
will become lesser even in time so so so

1986.84 --> 1991.399
that is you actually

1989.12 --> 1993.3799999999999
um like by misuse of so-called Freedom

1991.399 --> 1995.6589999999999
so that's that word free is a very very

1993.38 --> 1997.8200000000002
strange word right now because people

1995.659 --> 2001.5390000000002
are misusing it again like love again

1997.82 --> 2004.299
the same thing so and with a very big

2001.539 --> 2006.76
like faulty perception of Life at start

2004.299 --> 2008.679
so then you end up with words like this

2006.76 --> 2011.2
and the idea of freedom is probably

2008.679 --> 2013.539
Financial Freedom or traveling from one

2011.2 --> 2015.88
point to another or you know very very

2013.539 --> 2017.08
yeah like okay I mean even if you travel

2015.88 --> 2019.48
from one point to another you are still

2017.08 --> 2022.24
yourself you go to that point whatever

2019.48 --> 2024.519
problems mental any issues anything you

2022.24 --> 2026.38
have you still have those you know you

2024.519 --> 2030.46
it's not you don't change you're not out

2026.38 --> 2033.159
of that trap anywhere like yeah yeah

2030.46 --> 2036.279
necessary unnecessary activities

2033.159 --> 2038.5590000000002
unnecessary and nonsense and that's what

2036.279 --> 2041.44
I think uh that's what you see here this

2038.559 --> 2043.24
is the propagation Evol is nothing else

2041.44 --> 2045.88
nothing more nothing less than the

2043.24 --> 2049.06
propagation of unnecessary activities

2045.88 --> 2051.4190000000003
that we are probably have engaged into

2049.06 --> 2055.2999999999997
in our life we're like

2051.419 --> 2056.74
yes well the thing is uh if you look at

2055.3 --> 2058.659
this today's world like you know you

2056.74 --> 2060.9399999999996
have all kinds of jobs and stuff like

2058.659 --> 2062.379
that yeah you know like you have in

2060.94 --> 2065.619
American stuff you will find jobs like

2062.379 --> 2068.98
people have you know like they are just

2065.619 --> 2073.0
cut poodle here here's a dog's pools and

2068.98 --> 2075.46
uh they they make them more like

2073.0 --> 2078.099
um like fashionable or something like I

2075.46 --> 2079.78
mean there are uh there are people what

2078.099 --> 2083.56
is trainers to teach the dogs how to

2079.78 --> 2085.0600000000004
walk okay okay I mean so I mean there

2083.56 --> 2087.22
are there so many kind of activities

2085.06 --> 2090.52
right now out there which are totally

2087.22 --> 2092.02
you know I mean I if you don't I can't

2090.52 --> 2094.119
call them unnecessary I mean obviously

2092.02 --> 2096.399
then you're lacking complete like I mean

2094.119 --> 2097.9
because the necessary activity is what

2096.399 --> 2099.8199999999997
because you have to do action necessary

2097.9 --> 2102.2200000000003
activities for survival and evolution

2099.82 --> 2105.7000000000003
okay you go to survive and evolve okay

2102.22 --> 2109.72
that comes under necessary actions any

2105.7 --> 2111.52
action besides that will create like

2109.72 --> 2114.04
your unnecessary that thing an

2111.52 --> 2117.579
unnecessary action will create a karmic

2114.04 --> 2120.52
balance for you more heavy debt which is

2117.579 --> 2122.5
because actions have reactions okay now

2120.52 --> 2124.839
so then then you'll be trapped more and

2122.5 --> 2126.82
more so it's like you're building a big

2124.839 --> 2128.98
mountain for yourself which you'll be

2126.82 --> 2130.3
trapped under basically so and that

2128.98 --> 2132.46
mountain will be made of unnecessary

2130.3 --> 2134.44
actions okay and then you will say oh

2132.46 --> 2136.359
why am I so feeling so weighty and why

2134.44 --> 2138.28
am I so why is all this weight don't

2136.359 --> 2140.7999999999997
mean like this weight is on you because

2138.28 --> 2142.48
you're creating this mountain of

2140.8 --> 2146.2000000000003
unnecessary actions which you are

2142.48 --> 2148.0
carrying then on your shoulders then you

2146.2 --> 2151.1189999999997
go on in the well pretend that they're

2148.0 --> 2152.92
necessary so yeah yeah I mean there's

2151.119 --> 2154.2400000000002
nothing necessary about any of that I

2152.92 --> 2156.099
mean there's nothing necessary for any

2154.24 --> 2157.24
human being to do anything but an

2156.099 --> 2159.339
evolving action there's nothing

2157.24 --> 2161.7999999999997
necessary for human being then to take

2159.339 --> 2163.359
control of their own body and through

2161.8 --> 2165.94
that their own mind I mean there is

2163.359 --> 2168.2799999999997
nothing else which is but also the idea

2165.94 --> 2171.28
of survival which you touch at one point

2168.28 --> 2174.82
and there the words survive you know

2171.28 --> 2177.0400000000004
should be s-e-r net s-u-r so right there

2174.82 --> 2179.98
we have a very faulty perception of what

2177.04 --> 2181.66
surviving is yeah surviving is not just

2179.98 --> 2184.119
like you're surviving your body like you

2181.66 --> 2186.339
point is that you are having a body

2184.119 --> 2188.5
which is good enough to serve any higher

2186.339 --> 2190.9
being or purpose higher purpose so so

2188.5 --> 2193.72
then your instrument is ready

2190.9 --> 2195.88
for doing that service that's what it's

2193.72 --> 2197.7999999999997
not just like just I mean making sure

2195.88 --> 2199.54
that your instrument exists what

2197.8 --> 2201.1600000000003
survival is considered right now is just

2199.54 --> 2203.619
making sure that instrument exists at

2201.16 --> 2205.42
all like okay no it is to keep your

2203.619 --> 2207.1600000000003
instrument at a level where it can

2205.42 --> 2210.2200000000003
actually do the work whatever is

2207.16 --> 2212.98
required for it or ask of it in any

2210.22 --> 2215.4399999999996
situation or circumstance yeah and we

2212.98 --> 2218.26
have such a powerful instrument that

2215.44 --> 2220.9
everyone has and it has chords too like

2218.26 --> 2223.42
a guitar it's your voice you know we

2220.9 --> 2224.619
should so much lift it I mean that's

2223.42 --> 2226.48
what I've read that's what I've

2224.619 --> 2228.6600000000003
discovered I think you know this is my

2226.48 --> 2228.66
voice

2229.859 --> 2234.5789999999997
I mean obviously like I mean if you are

2232.24 --> 2236.3199999999997
not able to speak right now your that

2234.579 --> 2238.119
thing is there and uh you don't have the

2236.32 --> 2240.339
energy to speak or if you can't do any

2238.119 --> 2242.619
such thing then your instrument is not

2240.339 --> 2244.54
of any purpose so even for any positive

2242.619 --> 2247.2400000000002
thing or any positive cause you are not

2244.54 --> 2250.119
able to do something so so survival is

2247.24 --> 2252.64
only for actually doing something uh

2250.119 --> 2255.48
real and something good for higher and

2252.64 --> 2255.48
divine course that's

2256.92 --> 2259.92
like

2262.68 --> 2268.72
small words but for some people it means

2265.599 --> 2270.76
so much yes you know ego is simply the

2268.72 --> 2272.4399999999996
false knowing within one masquerade

2270.76 --> 2274.96
thing as a real knowing you know we

2272.44 --> 2277.96
don't know I realize myself that I

2274.96 --> 2280.0
didn't know nothing worth knowing that's

2277.96 --> 2282.76
why going back to square one and start

2280.0 --> 2284.98
to relearn for you know here in Canada

2282.76 --> 2287.1400000000003
and us I heard you say that in another

2284.98 --> 2289.839
video people don't even know how to go

2287.14 --> 2291.94
to the toilet yes yes we don't even know

2289.839 --> 2295.48
how to go to the toilet we use toilet

2291.94 --> 2297.76
paper that's then very abrasive

2295.48 --> 2300.52
very anyway I won't go into details what

2297.76 --> 2303.1600000000003
toilet paper do I think everyone can

2300.52 --> 2305.2599999999998
have had the experience once with toilet

2303.16 --> 2306.8199999999997
paper but just that you know we don't

2305.26 --> 2309.82
even know how to use the body how to

2306.82 --> 2311.26
treat it yes yes I mean I mean I mean

2309.82 --> 2313.839
they can be like that thing even if

2311.26 --> 2315.6400000000003
somebody uses a whole roll they can

2313.839 --> 2317.2599999999998
still not lean there like even if you

2315.64 --> 2319.24
use the whole role you will not be clean

2317.26 --> 2321.2200000000003
like them say there's there's no

2319.24 --> 2322.5989999999997
question of like so I mean that's that's

2321.22 --> 2323.56
the reality of it but people can't

2322.599 --> 2325.2400000000002
figure that out because their

2323.56 --> 2326.859
observation is not outside you know like

2325.24 --> 2329.2599999999998
again we talked about observation

2326.859 --> 2330.7
observing they can't observe anything so

2329.26 --> 2332.619
they can't tell what is common sensible

2330.7 --> 2334.839
whether it's making sense or not people

2332.619 --> 2338.2000000000003
do things just because everybody else is

2334.839 --> 2339.82
doing it that's all it's not on the

2338.2 --> 2342.3999999999996
basis of their individual observation of

2339.82 --> 2345.1600000000003
anything yes yeah but sometimes with the

2342.4 --> 2346.839
Comfort the more soft it is they think

2345.16 --> 2350.3199999999997
it's not going to be abrasive or stuff

2346.839 --> 2351.66
and the worst is we go cut trees to yeah

2350.32 --> 2354.52
but it's always going to be like I mean

2351.66 --> 2356.7999999999997
you know it's incredible friction is

2354.52 --> 2359.619
friction I mean only water is not

2356.8 --> 2361.599
frictionless like yeah exactly water but

2359.619 --> 2363.46
many many people have that they have

2361.599 --> 2365.26
that toilet and then on the side they

2363.46 --> 2367.7200000000003
have that thing to to uh wash yourself

2365.26 --> 2369.2200000000003
you just sit on it and you watch it's

2367.72 --> 2370.72
very easy yeah I mean but that is also

2369.22 --> 2373.2999999999997
stupid that thing you can just have like

2370.72 --> 2375.8199999999997
a like that thing like a sprayer or you

2373.3 --> 2377.5600000000004
can have a like a with a like a mug or

2375.82 --> 2380.1400000000003
something like that is more easier yeah

2377.56 --> 2382.0
I mean that big day is also uncommon

2380.14 --> 2384.7
sensical it's not impractical to the

2382.0 --> 2386.2
device it plays a lot of water I mean

2384.7 --> 2387.9399999999996
even that cannot do it properly because

2386.2 --> 2390.66
your hands have to be involved you know

2387.94 --> 2394.32
so water is the best

2390.66 --> 2396.7599999999998
so we go energy needs to go for sure but

2394.32 --> 2398.44
Out of Hell into heaven and Beyond

2396.76 --> 2401.6800000000003
that's where it's going going for my

2398.44 --> 2404.32
selfish selfish is a word also live that

2401.68 --> 2406.359
many people like I was under the

2404.32 --> 2408.2200000000003
impression that people were selfish but

2406.359 --> 2411.46
when I started reading this I'm like no

2408.22 --> 2413.68
no we're just plain foolish it's not

2411.46 --> 2416.02
selfish if I would be selfish I would

2413.68 --> 2418.48
take care of myself more than that I

2416.02 --> 2421.42
would say they're consider the self at

2418.48 --> 2423.64
least yes yes yeah I mean that's what I

2421.42 --> 2426.4
said like if you can't love yourself you

2423.64 --> 2429.4
can't love anything in this place you

2426.4 --> 2431.32
cannot like so okay so so but so having

2429.4 --> 2433.0
that is not selfish like it's nothing

2431.32 --> 2435.94
selfish about it like you know it's

2433.0 --> 2438.64
actually the real thing that's what the

2435.94 --> 2441.16
Multiverse wants of you to take care or

2438.64 --> 2444.8199999999997
be responsible or have love for yourself

2441.16 --> 2446.6189999999997
like all these words again like come in

2444.82 --> 2448.54
and that's that's what it is you know so

2446.619 --> 2450.1600000000003
so it's like what people consider

2448.54 --> 2451.3
selfish or this person cares about

2450.16 --> 2452.74
themselves I mean if they care about

2451.3 --> 2455.8590000000004
themselves as a very good thing I mean

2452.74 --> 2458.9199999999996
what's wrong with that I mean I mean I

2455.859 --> 2461.619
mean but if you foolish if you're still

2458.92 --> 2465.4
in your foolish State they will bring a

2461.619 --> 2469.0
lot of inside and to others like yeah

2465.4 --> 2471.2200000000003
yeah yes yeah like so yes you become

2469.0 --> 2474.52
very very insane at one point like

2471.22 --> 2477.4599999999996
people I think uh very unnatural very

2474.52 --> 2478.9
insane that was my case I I recognized

2477.46 --> 2483.099
it that's why I'm here I want to change

2478.9 --> 2485.26
I want to relearn how to live yes yes so

2483.099 --> 2487.839
yes yes

2485.26 --> 2490.9
then you go with opinion opinion that's

2487.839 --> 2492.94
a very I've never like I don't you know

2490.9 --> 2494.619
what we don't look in general we don't

2492.94 --> 2496.2400000000002
absurd but we don't even look at the

2494.619 --> 2498.1600000000003
words we don't even look at the words

2496.24 --> 2500.5
because in the words you can make sense

2498.16 --> 2504.0989999999997
I have a lot of things especially oh

2500.5 --> 2506.2
Pine neon Pine

2504.099 --> 2508.06
so we'll extend a little bit yeah yeah

2506.2 --> 2509.98
so the thing is like what I was saying

2508.06 --> 2511.66
that everybody here is opinion you know

2509.98 --> 2513.52
like everybody think oh I can have an

2511.66 --> 2514.96
opinion I can have an opinion about and

2513.52 --> 2517.18
people are doing debates that's what's

2514.96 --> 2520.0
called debate isn't it when people with

2517.18 --> 2521.98
varying opinions like uh clash with each

2520.0 --> 2523.359
other and they all are saying their

2521.98 --> 2525.339
opinions all of these people different

2523.359 --> 2527.38
different people and the point is to

2525.339 --> 2528.82
have an opinion you have to be opinion

2527.38 --> 2531.7200000000003
functioning because that's the word

2528.82 --> 2533.8
means your your final is giving you that

2531.72 --> 2535.18
opinion like it's giving you that

2533.8 --> 2537.52
information which you're sharing with

2535.18 --> 2539.2599999999998
others but these people's pineal is not

2537.52 --> 2541.119
functioning so then you basically don't

2539.26 --> 2542.44
have any opinion you are just talking

2541.119 --> 2546.04
out of your ass what it's called talking

2542.44 --> 2547.54
out of your ass like you know so so when

2546.04 --> 2549.2799999999997
you're talking about it to us then that

2547.54 --> 2551.5
is not an opinion and it does not matter

2549.28 --> 2553.8390000000004
I mean it's not based in any kind of

2551.5 --> 2555.64
reality or multiple law or pure

2553.839 --> 2558.4
principle or anything

2555.64 --> 2560.68
which is real so yeah yeah so then

2558.4 --> 2563.38
that's why these opinions don't matter

2560.68 --> 2565.18
and and that's why you see headlines

2563.38 --> 2566.7400000000002
like opinions matter opinions matter

2565.18 --> 2568.54
everywhere like

2566.74 --> 2570.5789999999997
um in newspapers and that things in

2568.54 --> 2574.96
magazines and all over this world like

2570.579 --> 2577.48
your opinion matters I mean yeah I mean

2574.96 --> 2579.7
now it doesn't matter at all because you

2577.48 --> 2582.04
have no opinion to begin with like so

2579.7 --> 2584.2599999999998
yeah like first of all you have a very

2582.04 --> 2586.42
faulty perception of Life of your own

2584.26 --> 2588.28
being of your everything that that

2586.42 --> 2589.359
surrounds you and then you have opinion

2588.28 --> 2592.3590000000004
like

2589.359 --> 2592.359
asks

2592.599 --> 2596.619
ask you like your opinion matters and

2594.94 --> 2598.48
then you fill up a form and give your

2596.619 --> 2600.099
opinion and they say like so that just

2598.48 --> 2602.079
to fool people and stuff like that this

2600.099 --> 2604.119
is just a device to fool people and put

2602.079 --> 2605.98
them up on a pedestal and when where

2604.119 --> 2607.42
they are not and giving them the sense

2605.98 --> 2609.7
of like you are something great like

2607.42 --> 2611.619
your opinion matters and you know it's

2609.7 --> 2614.98
when nothing really matters at all like

2611.619 --> 2617.38
in that case after you go on with

2614.98 --> 2620.26
emotion and that's a big big one because

2617.38 --> 2622.359
uh you know that's what I do each and

2620.26 --> 2624.46
every day deposit and my emotional bank

2622.359 --> 2626.02
account you know I want a big big

2624.46 --> 2628.7200000000003
emotional bank account when I have

2626.02 --> 2630.819
Galactic emotions like you say but clear

2628.72 --> 2633.9399999999996
the emotions like there's people even

2630.819 --> 2636.4
have emotion the real emotion like I

2633.94 --> 2638.68
mean I don't know I see sometimes them

2636.4 --> 2641.7000000000003
repeating a lot the same stuff each and

2638.68 --> 2644.94
every day so yeah I mean emotion is

2641.7 --> 2647.98
I mean emotion is any energy in motion

2644.94 --> 2651.04
so any energy in motion okay so like

2647.98 --> 2653.319
okay people have energy but that energy

2651.04 --> 2655.359
emotion can be scattered yeah

2653.319 --> 2658.119
it doesn't have to be or it doesn't have

2655.359 --> 2660.339
to make sense like from right now to 10

2658.119 --> 2662.319
years like the whole energy in motion

2660.339 --> 2664.7799999999997
they have whether it makes sense as a

2662.319 --> 2667.24
whole or not you know then it is a

2664.78 --> 2668.98
proper coherent emotion otherwise it's a

2667.24 --> 2670.66
scattered emotion which is uh because

2668.98 --> 2672.52
energy motion every being will have any

2670.66 --> 2675.22
being which exists will have energy

2672.52 --> 2678.46
which is in motion okay now how is that

2675.22 --> 2682.0
energy is a different matter you know

2678.46 --> 2684.04
like so and uh sorry where you direct

2682.0 --> 2686.52
your energy each and every day you know

2684.04 --> 2688.8
why people feel

2686.52 --> 2692.02
each and every second like yeah yeah

2688.8 --> 2693.88
that's it and that builds up that that

2692.02 --> 2697.06
state of Blizzard that we were talking

2693.88 --> 2700.06
also uh prior you know it's check your

2697.06 --> 2702.22
emotion also knowing your emotional

2700.06 --> 2704.319
state is knowing Thai self is there's

2702.22 --> 2706.8999999999996
that what you can say when a being

2704.319 --> 2709.24
control is emotional state like if I

2706.9 --> 2711.579
don't if I don't react and I respond and

2709.24 --> 2713.74
I'm not in anger and like when the

2711.579 --> 2716.319
situation arise that would normally

2713.74 --> 2719.319
trigger anger but then I know what's my

2716.319 --> 2721.72
trigger and I urea you respond better

2719.319 --> 2724.06
not with anger but with love and you

2721.72 --> 2726.4599999999996
know is that knowing yourself better but

2724.06 --> 2729.099
no no no the thing with energy in motion

2726.46 --> 2731.079
is first this is that your energy in

2729.099 --> 2734.319
motion is first through your body

2731.079 --> 2737.44
okay because your body is the one which

2734.319 --> 2741.46
acts okay okay so so the more control

2737.44 --> 2743.7400000000002
you have over your body okay the more

2741.46 --> 2745.54
energy you can Channel better your

2743.74 --> 2748.2999999999997
energy in motion would be better better

2745.54 --> 2749.619
okay so it starts with the body actually

2748.3 --> 2751.3
it doesn't start with the mind or

2749.619 --> 2753.1600000000003
doesn't start with mental triggers or it

2751.3 --> 2755.319
doesn't start with uh mental responses

2753.16 --> 2757.5989999999997
or mental emotion which people think

2755.319 --> 2759.94
um emotional is a mental thing actually

2757.599 --> 2762.76
but it is not it is a body thing first

2759.94 --> 2764.7400000000002
okay there's a there's a body emotion

2762.76 --> 2767.8590000000004
like which is what people call dance or

2764.74 --> 2770.319
people call any kind of thing or people

2767.859 --> 2772.06
call different things but that is the

2770.319 --> 2774.579
actual emotion is First Energy in Motion

2772.06 --> 2777.4
in physical body form that is what we

2774.579 --> 2778.54
have as human being out there okay so

2777.4 --> 2781.3
that is the thing which we have to

2778.54 --> 2782.859
control first okay the mental part of it

2781.3 --> 2786.2200000000003
the psychological part of it will take

2782.859 --> 2787.68
care of itself after that okay

2786.22 --> 2791.7999999999997
um

2787.68 --> 2794.0789999999997
yeah yeah we can we can generate great

2791.8 --> 2796.7200000000003
energy also we're like a power plant I'm

2794.079 --> 2798.4
like a power plant I can generate energy

2796.72 --> 2802.06
yeah but without discipline of the body

2798.4 --> 2803.56
you cannot have current energy in Motion

2802.06 --> 2806.2
in this

2803.56 --> 2808.2999999999997
aspect of incarnation and physical

2806.2 --> 2810.2799999999997
Incarnation which beings are in you

2808.3 --> 2812.44
cannot have that without the physical

2810.28 --> 2815.3390000000004
discipline So Physical discipline is the

2812.44 --> 2819.339
key to that completely

2815.339 --> 2821.319
the minds of author intent uh here you

2819.339 --> 2824.02
go because most people that's what we

2821.319 --> 2826.24
hear about the hope that God will or

2824.02 --> 2829.18
Divine will come down on Earth and come

2826.24 --> 2831.52
down judge I remember that in the in the

2829.18 --> 2833.3799999999997
reggae song come down Georgia I'm like

2831.52 --> 2835.66
okay what you think someone's gonna come

2833.38 --> 2839.1400000000003
down and solve the all the mess here

2835.66 --> 2840.7599999999998
it's up to us when the thing is uh mess

2839.14 --> 2842.92
can always be solved that's not a

2840.76 --> 2844.599
problem okay I mean like the thing is

2842.92 --> 2846.46
that higher forces Divine forces can

2844.599 --> 2847.78
solve any mess that's not a problem only

2846.46 --> 2851.02
thing is it it will not solve anything

2847.78 --> 2853.38
for you okay I mean it will be solved

2851.02 --> 2853.38
for the Earth

2853.8 --> 2858.3390000000004
like the situation out on Earth will

2856.18 --> 2860.14
become fine okay what will happen to you

2858.339 --> 2862.18
is that you will be sent to some other

2860.14 --> 2865.48
part of the universe which is called

2862.18 --> 2867.5789999999997
hell like where you you you will have

2865.48 --> 2869.38
you'll be under that thing so solution

2867.579 --> 2871.48
will happen it's not like the solution

2869.38 --> 2873.76
will not happen but it won't be for you

2871.48 --> 2875.319
like what you consider a solution for

2873.76 --> 2877.3
yourself so when you have to solve

2875.319 --> 2878.98
things for yourself then you have to do

2877.3 --> 2880.0
what the higher and divine tells that

2878.98 --> 2881.619
this is the right thing to do then you

2880.0 --> 2883.48
have to do that if you don't do that

2881.619 --> 2884.5
that is up to you because you will solve

2883.48 --> 2886.839
for yourself

2884.5 --> 2888.819
like as a whole on a collective level on

2886.839 --> 2890.5
a Earth plane This Plane level that can

2888.819 --> 2892.42
be solved by higher beings they can

2890.5 --> 2895.3
solve it any time they can solve that in

2892.42 --> 2897.52
five minutes okay there is no problem in

2895.3 --> 2901.1800000000003
solving anything out here like that's

2897.52 --> 2903.339
that's a little like a Lego card game

2901.18 --> 2905.14
for them like it's nothing like all this

2903.339 --> 2907.599
whatever humans have done okay there's

2905.14 --> 2910.42
nothing much at all like you know it's

2907.599 --> 2913.1800000000003
like uh it's it's a it's a tiny little

2910.42 --> 2915.339
thing it's nothing yeah like there's

2913.18 --> 2918.0989999999997
nothing really in nature out of control

2915.339 --> 2921.5789999999997
like things are under control working

2918.099 --> 2924.52
patiently yeah the river flow everything

2921.579 --> 2927.2200000000003
the wind blows you know what the season

2924.52 --> 2928.96
change okay and people think that

2927.22 --> 2930.2799999999997
they're polluted so much or whatever the

2928.96 --> 2933.099
pollution there's no pollution nothing

2930.28 --> 2936.3390000000004
which cannot be reversed in five minutes

2933.099 --> 2937.96
okay so so so there is nothing people

2936.339 --> 2941.22
think there's a huge problem hugeness

2937.96 --> 2943.54
there's nothing like that okay

2941.22 --> 2944.7599999999998
yeah this is a propaganda and stuff like

2943.54 --> 2946.66
that okay yes

2944.76 --> 2950.92
yeah

2946.66 --> 2954.22
the age-old question you know that's a

2950.92 --> 2957.04
good one because uh I think I think you

2954.22 --> 2959.7999999999997
know you go what are beings created for

2957.04 --> 2962.38
that's a question that many people have

2959.8 --> 2964.54
in their that lingers in their mind and

2962.38 --> 2967.1800000000003
you know they can go on a whole life

2964.54 --> 2969.579
like that wondering what's your life

2967.18 --> 2972.04
about what's like like some people like

2969.579 --> 2973.78
not the let alone that we don't know how

2972.04 --> 2976.18
to go to the toilet like we don't even

2973.78 --> 2978.099
know what life is for like we're so uh

2976.18 --> 2979.5989999999997
and life is so precious it's the only

2978.099 --> 2983.02
experience we're gonna have it's a

2979.599 --> 2985.3590000000004
Divine experience but then we we pass it

2983.02 --> 2988.66
wandering all our life yeah the point is

2985.359 --> 2991.06
that all existence the was created for

2988.66 --> 2993.0989999999997
experiencing Bliss and pleasure and hire

2991.06 --> 2995.56
that things that's what it was created

2993.099 --> 2997.78
for so so but the thing was that

2995.56 --> 3000.06
obviously once beings were experienced

2997.78 --> 3002.46
all of that and uh the thing was that

3000.06 --> 3005.04
once when being some beings went against

3002.46 --> 3006.78
the natural law and the Divine Law and

3005.04 --> 3008.64
that's when they started suffering so

3006.78 --> 3009.9
that's when suffering came into being so

3008.64 --> 3011.819
when you start suffering then you don't

3009.9 --> 3014.28
like the creation very much because then

3011.819 --> 3015.9
now it's not fun anymore if it's fun

3014.28 --> 3017.76
then everyone is happy like everyone is

3015.9 --> 3019.619
likes to have fun okay like there's

3017.76 --> 3022.44
nobody who does not like to have fun so

3019.619 --> 3024.54
so then that's as long as stage one and

3022.44 --> 3027.0
it's fun but once it becomes a suffering

3024.54 --> 3028.74
which is your own creative creation okay

3027.0 --> 3031.079
then you don't like it then you start

3028.74 --> 3032.7599999999998
questioning the purpose of existence

3031.079 --> 3036.119
itself because now your existence is not

3032.76 --> 3038.46
so very good like it's it's bad okay now

3036.119 --> 3040.44
so then you have to take that point term

3038.46 --> 3043.44
to make it from bad to good again

3040.44 --> 3046.26
instead of complaining and whining and

3043.44 --> 3048.059
whinging okay like that look my

3046.26 --> 3049.5
existence is so bad why is this

3048.059 --> 3051.48
existence created itself that's the kind

3049.5 --> 3054.42
of thoughts which come to beings at that

3051.48 --> 3057.059
time okay but you can't unexist you

3054.42 --> 3058.8
can't delete yourself this is not a

3057.059 --> 3062.099
computer game where you know like you

3058.8 --> 3065.1600000000003
just press delete or like uh that things

3062.099 --> 3068.04
press unexistence button like that I

3065.16 --> 3069.96
choose to one exist okay no you will

3068.04 --> 3072.48
keep on existing whether you like it or

3069.96 --> 3074.7
not but in a bad circumstance so what

3072.48 --> 3075.9
you can do is you can actually improve

3074.7 --> 3078.54
your circumstance for that you will have

3075.9 --> 3081.7200000000003
to do something okay and that is taking

3078.54 --> 3082.92
responsibility okay so so beings a lot

3081.72 --> 3084.4199999999996
of beings which think in terms of

3082.92 --> 3087.119
suicide a lot of people commit suicide

3084.42 --> 3088.859
even okay they don't realize that you

3087.119 --> 3091.7000000000003
know that is another p-log so we'll

3088.859 --> 3096.5989999999997
discuss that at that point

3091.7 --> 3098.52
yeah we come to this life life but like

3096.599 --> 3100.92
I say the The Purge even the the

3098.52 --> 3103.68
perception of Life what is life for what

3100.92 --> 3105.42
is life to me today it's I have that

3103.68 --> 3107.339
sense a bit limit today it's very clear

3105.42 --> 3109.859
that it's a preparation it's a

3107.339 --> 3111.48
preparation for maybe I don't know for

3109.859 --> 3114.9
sure but there again there's got to be

3111.48 --> 3116.099
something like in my life is a better

3114.9 --> 3117.9
experience it's having a positive

3116.099 --> 3121.2000000000003
experience better experience like life

3117.9 --> 3123.54
is having and continuously evolving your

3121.2 --> 3126.24
experience actually like you know you

3123.54 --> 3129.7799999999997
don't want to be stuck at a lower level

3126.24 --> 3132.7799999999997
of experience where it is like a pain

3129.78 --> 3135.78
and a torture and a boredom and uh

3132.78 --> 3138.5400000000004
nonsense for you like and negative

3135.78 --> 3140.28
overall yeah yes because it's a

3138.54 --> 3143.16
different process than preparing

3140.28 --> 3144.96
yourself for after life than preparing

3143.16 --> 3147.42
your lunch to go to work the next day

3144.96 --> 3149.579
it's a very different preparation yeah

3147.42 --> 3151.44
yeah yes yes obviously we agree with

3149.579 --> 3153.7200000000003
that yeah yeah and obviously what you

3151.44 --> 3154.76
make for lunch is also part of that yeah

3153.72 --> 3158.3999999999996
yeah yeah

3154.76 --> 3161.76
yes okay like so so that is also part of

3158.4 --> 3163.6800000000003
it so what I'm saying is but it is

3161.76 --> 3165.96
overall like but people obviously do not

3163.68 --> 3169.02
prepare for that big Journey

3165.96 --> 3170.88
after this physical body which is like

3169.02 --> 3173.46
that thing so little Journeys out here

3170.88 --> 3175.559
people prepare much more for then they

3173.46 --> 3178.8
prepare for that like so and again it's

3175.559 --> 3180.96
not the preparation to live there's is

3178.8 --> 3183.1800000000003
very differently because life is about

3180.96 --> 3185.339
living it's about living in the moment

3183.18 --> 3187.68
you know being here so it's not the

3185.339 --> 3190.02
preparation to live your life in this

3187.68 --> 3192.839
life to access and after life

3190.02 --> 3194.4
living life obviously once uh once you

3192.839 --> 3195.599
know more about afterlife and death and

3194.4 --> 3197.579
that thing and once you're ready for

3195.599 --> 3200.339
that then it becomes easier to live here

3197.579 --> 3202.02
like it becomes much more easier to live

3200.339 --> 3203.5789999999997
in this moment properly and easily

3202.02 --> 3205.859
without having all those fears and

3203.579 --> 3208.1400000000003
negativities which are attached with

3205.859 --> 3210.54
death and people have fear death a whole

3208.14 --> 3211.3799999999997
lot most of the beings do because you

3210.54 --> 3212.88
know because they don't know what's

3211.38 --> 3214.859
coming next and they have no idea and

3212.88 --> 3217.6800000000003
they have no clue and um a lot of times

3214.859 --> 3219.42
they have done a lot of wrong Karma hair

3217.68 --> 3221.16
right now and then they are

3219.42 --> 3223.5
fearing the

3221.16 --> 3225.18
that thing of it so so so there's a

3223.5 --> 3227.339
whole lot of fear which is generated

3225.18 --> 3230.04
from that kind of thing so yeah yeah so

3227.339 --> 3233.18
then it it is not easy to live here in a

3230.04 --> 3235.92
pleasant easy way like then like yes

3233.18 --> 3238.14
then you go with your uh observation in

3235.92 --> 3240.78
The Matrix and uh first uh the present

3238.14 --> 3242.16
Matrix like if you don't know you're in

3240.78 --> 3244.5
prison how do you want to escape it

3242.16 --> 3247.98
that's common sense everyone knows that

3244.5 --> 3249.78
look but the thing is we don't know that

3247.98 --> 3252.079
we don't know that we don't know that

3249.78 --> 3255.1800000000003
we're in the prison that was my case

3252.079 --> 3258.3
five years ago four years ago I didn't

3255.18 --> 3261.18
know very low awareness like no

3258.3 --> 3263.52
awareness at all like yeah I go back

3261.18 --> 3265.7999999999997
it's like it knows no awareness it's

3263.52 --> 3267.24
like I can't even listen because the

3265.8 --> 3269.3390000000004
point is you can't see the bars here

3267.24 --> 3271.319
it's not so easy like if you're in a

3269.339 --> 3273.48
prison with the bars then you can see

3271.319 --> 3275.64
the bars okay these are the bars like I

3273.48 --> 3278.22
can't go out of this room like hey but

3275.64 --> 3281.64
here you can't see the bars that clearly

3278.22 --> 3283.9199999999996
easily like you know like so yeah I see

3281.64 --> 3286.319
the bar I see the bar there is a lot

3283.92 --> 3288.599
here in Canada in U.S bars where you go

3286.319 --> 3290.64
drink you know that's probably the bar I

3288.599 --> 3293.28
see in this prison and many people end

3290.64 --> 3295.319
up in behind those kind of bar

3293.28 --> 3297.2400000000002
yeah bars a bit but again they cannot

3295.319 --> 3299.2799999999997
see it as bad they see something good or

3297.24 --> 3302.3999999999996
something fun like it's not seen as a

3299.28 --> 3304.619
bar bars you know like so so these iron

3302.4 --> 3306.599
bars or that bars or you can't see the

3304.619 --> 3308.1600000000003
bars here you can't see that you are

3306.599 --> 3310.2000000000003
actually in a prison I think if people

3308.16 --> 3312.2999999999997
have little bit of movement here they

3310.2 --> 3313.5589999999997
can go from point A to point B

3312.3 --> 3316.98
if you're in Canada they can go from

3313.559 --> 3319.079
Vancouver to Quebec to to that thing to

3316.98 --> 3320.52
um whatever Alberta then they think that

3319.079 --> 3321.78
they have freedom they're not in a

3320.52 --> 3323.579
prison because obviously they are moving

3321.78 --> 3326.76
from here to there to here to there then

3323.579 --> 3329.2200000000003
they think that there is some uh like um

3326.76 --> 3331.7400000000002
like that you're not in a prison but uh

3329.22 --> 3333.24
so to to get to that you need a little

3331.74 --> 3334.6189999999997
more awareness

3333.24 --> 3336.359
than

3334.619 --> 3338.1600000000003
um being Zab and for that you have to

3336.359 --> 3339.96
actually observe and you actually have

3338.16 --> 3344.339
to be honest observation and honesty are

3339.96 --> 3346.44
the key factors and yeah that's probably

3344.339 --> 3348.66
the hardest prison you're gonna break

3346.44 --> 3350.52
out in your life is that Matrix is that

3348.66 --> 3353.46
prison in your mind is that prison

3350.52 --> 3354.359
stated that you're in like do you agree

3353.46 --> 3356.88
with that

3354.359 --> 3359.339
yes obviously that is uh that is lack of

3356.88 --> 3361.079
uh like that's ignorance basically what

3359.339 --> 3363.72
what you'll call it there's a prison of

3361.079 --> 3366.42
ignorance okay you don't you don't know

3363.72 --> 3367.98
but uh but when you don't know you have

3366.42 --> 3369.66
to admit that you don't know that

3367.98 --> 3372.66
admitting once you admit that you don't

3369.66 --> 3374.8799999999997
know then you can find out right exactly

3372.66 --> 3376.2
you can find out if you admit that you

3374.88 --> 3377.819
don't know but if you if your country

3376.2 --> 3379.3799999999997
anymore but I know I know I know then

3377.819 --> 3381.9
then you will never

3379.38 --> 3384.359
like then there is no movement possible

3381.9 --> 3386.88
of any kind of actual knowing and that

3384.359 --> 3389.0989999999997
thing so so that's that's an important

3386.88 --> 3391.859
thing yes yes and we're going to finish

3389.099 --> 3396.0
it today with the reality as it is okay

3391.859 --> 3399.0
and most people refuse refuse completely

3396.0 --> 3402.3
refuse to see reality as it is I was a

3399.0 --> 3404.7
bit like that until something happened a

3402.3 --> 3407.3390000000004
tragedy or why do we need like something

3404.7 --> 3410.2799999999997
to come and Shake us this so we open our

3407.339 --> 3412.5
eyes to life and start just it's like if

3410.28 --> 3414.599
you're I say often if you're confused if

3412.5 --> 3415.619
you don't know look at the sun look at

3414.599 --> 3417.96
the Sun

3415.619 --> 3419.94
yeah

3417.96 --> 3423.0
but the thing is that uh it's natural

3419.94 --> 3425.339
like if if uh like you know like if

3423.0 --> 3426.66
somebody is that thing you know sleeping

3425.339 --> 3427.98
and you're trying to wake them up and if

3426.66 --> 3429.8999999999996
you're a little tick tick they won't

3427.98 --> 3432.059
wake up then you'll do something more

3429.9 --> 3434.52
sound if they don't wake up then finally

3432.059 --> 3436.619
you will shake them if you don't wake up

3434.52 --> 3438.72
then you might throw water on them like

3436.619 --> 3442.079
so the thing will keep on increasing

3438.72 --> 3443.339
okay like it's not like the then the

3442.079 --> 3447.92
Nature has to

3443.339 --> 3451.319
uh create a more of a that thing

3447.92 --> 3452.579
yeah to to to wake you up like you know

3451.319 --> 3454.619
like so that's why it happens that's why

3452.579 --> 3457.079
it takes some more of a event

3454.619 --> 3459.559
to shake people up rather than like

3457.079 --> 3462.3
something light or something

3459.559 --> 3464.3390000000004
in your case that it took you a what

3462.3 --> 3467.099
happened in your life for you to to

3464.339 --> 3469.7999999999997
start because at one point I mean were

3467.099 --> 3473.6600000000003
you always like I think I have asked you

3469.8 --> 3473.6600000000003
prior but I don't know uh

3474.72 --> 3479.0989999999997
like though even though we are all born

3476.579 --> 3480.9
in this world okay but we are not born

3479.099 --> 3482.4
in the similar circumstance similar

3480.9 --> 3484.619
situation or then similar mindsets or

3482.4 --> 3486.7200000000003
similar that things like we all in very

3484.619 --> 3489.78
different worlds out there even okay

3486.72 --> 3491.339
beings even though we might be like in

3489.78 --> 3493.2000000000003
the same earth like but beings are in

3491.339 --> 3495.0
different worlds completely okay so

3493.2 --> 3496.98
where I was born and what I might think

3495.0 --> 3499.92
was that I had these kind of questions

3496.98 --> 3502.319
at age of four and five even like so so

3499.92 --> 3503.88
for me like it uh like my institution

3502.319 --> 3506.099
was like an alien out there like

3503.88 --> 3507.54
basically like where you are that thing

3506.099 --> 3510.54
you know you are like what is all this

3507.54 --> 3512.88
where am I what where am I what is what

3510.54 --> 3514.5589999999997
is this like like this kind of situation

3512.88 --> 3516.599
you know if you are put into another

3514.559 --> 3518.2200000000003
planet right now immediately you don't

3516.599 --> 3519.9
know anything about that planet and you

3518.22 --> 3521.4599999999996
have got no idea you are a new person

3519.9 --> 3523.2000000000003
you don't know what people are there do

3521.46 --> 3525.2400000000002
anything then you'll be like same

3523.2 --> 3526.98
you'll be feeling like what is all this

3525.24 --> 3529.14
where am I whatever so that kind of

3526.98 --> 3533.099
situation for me so I didn't need

3529.14 --> 3534.299
anything to wake me up or anything just

3533.099 --> 3536.76
being here

3534.299 --> 3538.46
was enough of a

3536.76 --> 3543.599
painful

3538.46 --> 3545.819
yeah yeah yeah yeah like so so so

3543.599 --> 3547.619
it is very traumatizing when you look

3545.819 --> 3550.38
around and you look at beings around

3547.619 --> 3552.6600000000003
sometimes I have I don't know I prefer

3550.38 --> 3554.4
not like you say sometimes there's

3552.66 --> 3556.2599999999998
nothing to be said to some people that

3554.4 --> 3558.599
don't want to see the reality that don't

3556.26 --> 3560.2200000000003
want to face because the reality is

3558.599 --> 3562.559
facing the reality of your own being

3560.22 --> 3565.68
first that's the first reality you must

3562.559 --> 3567.2400000000002
face then I think the rest will like the

3565.68 --> 3570.54
words will come you will encounter

3567.24 --> 3572.7599999999998
people like you come my way to give me a

3570.54 --> 3575.4
bit of clarity to also shake me a bit

3572.76 --> 3577.8590000000004
more and you know sustain like I think

3575.4 --> 3578.94
that's the work the Divine I mean that's

3577.859 --> 3580.38
the whole thing that's the good thing

3578.94 --> 3582.96
about YouTube and stuff like finally

3580.38 --> 3584.099
like people can hear that kind of thing

3582.96 --> 3585.78
and then they can make their own

3584.099 --> 3588.059
decision I mean there is no force on

3585.78 --> 3591.3590000000004
them to like this or that or whatever

3588.059 --> 3593.3390000000004
but they can listen and find out because

3591.359 --> 3596.04
right now those kind of tools are there

3593.339 --> 3598.2
like where uh something from my world

3596.04 --> 3600.0
can interact with this people in other

3598.2 --> 3601.2599999999998
world like because they don't say murder

3600.0 --> 3602.64
but they're in the same not in the same

3601.26 --> 3605.46
world like I said

3602.64 --> 3607.02
like so if I'm uh like speaking to

3605.46 --> 3611.579
people or anything or you or anybody

3607.02 --> 3613.98
obviously I'm uh like changing myself to

3611.579 --> 3617.04
like uh

3613.98 --> 3618.66
be understood by those people because

3617.04 --> 3619.92
what I'm coming from otherwise will not

3618.66 --> 3622.02
be understood to them and in any way

3619.92 --> 3624.119
shape or form like like my existence or

3622.02 --> 3627.299
my way of being on what I'm coming from

3624.119 --> 3630.599
is is quite alien to them like actually

3627.299 --> 3633.119
like even on this Earth okay so so it's

3630.599 --> 3634.26
not like um so people think that human

3633.119 --> 3635.6400000000003
beings on Earth all the same people

3634.26 --> 3637.619
don't understand that there's a lot of

3635.64 --> 3639.66
different kind of things on earth even

3637.619 --> 3641.76
and different kind of Gene pools and

3639.66 --> 3643.2
different kind of that things and which

3641.76 --> 3645.059
are the different levels of different

3643.2 --> 3647.52
beings and all kinds of things are here

3645.059 --> 3649.7000000000003
so so people should not think that we

3647.52 --> 3652.2599999999998
are all just like the same and

3649.7 --> 3654.5989999999997
in the same kind of thing and it's not

3652.26 --> 3656.94
it's not like that at all you know so

3654.599 --> 3659.46
but a lot of that perception come from

3656.94 --> 3661.859
because we see the world as we are not

3659.46 --> 3664.26
as the world as it is we see the world

3661.859 --> 3665.5789999999997
as we are like mice being is a

3664.26 --> 3668.6400000000003
reflection of the world like if I'm

3665.579 --> 3670.5
negative today or I'm very depressed

3668.64 --> 3673.0789999999997
well the whole world is negative in

3670.5 --> 3675.66
depressed like it's not exactly it's not

3673.079 --> 3677.2200000000003
like I mean it's not like I mean and

3675.66 --> 3678.54
nothing what your perception is going to

3677.22 --> 3682.02
change the world or anything that will

3678.54 --> 3683.579
stay like what it is yes like I mean

3682.02 --> 3686.04
it's the sun will still shine tomorrow

3683.579 --> 3688.559
even if you're uh crabby and depressed

3686.04 --> 3691.94
it will still shine and then yeah that's

3688.559 --> 3691.94
it and so yeah

3699.2 --> 3704.339
