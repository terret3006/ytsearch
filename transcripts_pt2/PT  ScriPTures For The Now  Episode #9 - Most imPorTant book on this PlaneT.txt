1.1 --> 6.119999999999999
boom live in the direct greetings

3.959 --> 8.82
greeting Master PT how's it going today

6.12 --> 10.92
everything is fine and good everything

8.82 --> 13.259
is fine like yes

10.92 --> 15.780000000000001
okay let me just stop the sound in the

13.259 --> 18.240000000000002
background here okay perfect so uh we're

15.78 --> 20.698999999999998
gonna keep going with the scriptures for

18.24 --> 23.22
the now of present hold on I have

20.699 --> 25.619
something on my tongue okay it's gone I

23.22 --> 27.538999999999998
couldn't talk properly so yeah so we're

25.619 --> 29.279
gonna keep going with our with your book

27.539 --> 31.98
today uh we're gonna start with what

29.279 --> 33.96
goes in we have uh left with the cow I

31.98 --> 35.88
said I was gonna come back with the a

33.96 --> 39.36
bit with the cow they took out but I

35.88 --> 42.36
think we have went uh we said what what

39.36 --> 45.48
has to be said concerning the cowl I

42.36 --> 48.6
think it the rest is a is a conscious

45.48 --> 51.239
reflection that everyone has to have for

48.6 --> 54.239000000000004
themselves like I mean I cannot we

51.239 --> 56.64
cannot think for people at one point you

54.239 --> 58.44
can point them with you know a good

56.64 --> 60.899
teacher I think a good teacher is not

58.44 --> 63.839999999999996
really someone that give the answer but

60.899 --> 66.9
someone that bring a questioning into uh

63.84 --> 69.0
someone right yeah I mean questioning

66.9 --> 70.979
and the point is to give a solution I

69.0 --> 72.54
mean the thing is like a lot of people

70.979 --> 73.67999999999999
who are talking in the like you know

72.54 --> 76.32000000000001
that thing but they're not giving

73.68 --> 78.42
Solutions so there has to be a practical

76.32 --> 80.27999999999999
solution right exactly teacher means you

78.42 --> 82.08
have a practical solution where you can

80.28 --> 86.1
practically tell what should be done

82.08 --> 88.32
with the human body in you know so yeah

86.1 --> 92.52
that's that's why in one of my uh song

88.32 --> 96.74
that I had done on my plate session one

92.52 --> 96.74
of the singers say the true man Lucian

96.86 --> 103.619
that's my solution so what goes in what

100.439 --> 106.86
goes in okay uh because if we cannot

103.619 --> 109.979
take responsibility for what goes in our

106.86 --> 112.38
body like and this is very also uh

109.979 --> 115.619
tragic because we're talking about the

112.38 --> 119.579
Appetite for Destruction then this is

115.619 --> 121.799
huge and I don't know anybody that

119.579 --> 124.979
doesn't have a little bit of Appetite

121.799 --> 127.2
for Destruction like very often we are

124.979 --> 130.259
so unconscious of what we put in but

127.2 --> 134.04
thank the Divine that the body is

130.259 --> 136.26
capable of getting getting rid of most

134.04 --> 139.5
of the Toxin and stuff and capable to

136.26 --> 142.67999999999998
like it come on I've been probably uh

139.5 --> 146.16
trashing the inside for a good 40 years

142.68 --> 148.98000000000002
easy yes so you know and I'm still here

146.16 --> 152.22
vibrant and Alive with energy and stuff

148.98 --> 154.67999999999998
so the food inside is very very powerful

152.22 --> 155.76
so yeah what goes in is very important

154.68 --> 157.56
the thing is

155.76 --> 159.06
whenever we do something you get some

157.56 --> 160.92000000000002
discomfort

159.06 --> 162.84
you can override the discomfort but you

160.92 --> 164.57999999999998
feel some discomfort so that is the

162.84 --> 166.14000000000001
thing one always feels some discomfort

164.58 --> 169.20000000000002
whenever that thing is anything is

166.14 --> 171.05999999999997
happening so so one has to uh basically

169.2 --> 174.06
people do things because they don't uh

171.06 --> 175.92000000000002
think about consequences so like what's

174.06 --> 178.14000000000001
gonna happen like so they do things in

175.92 --> 181.2
that kind of mindless way where they are

178.14 --> 183.61999999999998
not cognizant of what is going to

181.2 --> 187.26
happen so that's why these things happen

183.62 --> 190.68
and also we just have like look these

187.26 --> 192.84
days if I want to feed my mouth and over

190.68 --> 195.48000000000002
feed my mouth just gotta go to the store

192.84 --> 199.31900000000002
take money and buy whatever I want and

195.48 --> 201.06
be a glutton and like I can we I don't

199.319 --> 203.57999999999998
know how much but you know this is

201.06 --> 206.4
what's happening it's too easy it's very

203.58 --> 208.5
accessible the meat and all that by the

206.4 --> 211.26000000000002
meat the dead animals inside the counter

208.5 --> 214.739
it's very accessible so you know that

211.26 --> 217.319
yes yes it's it's a quite easy so the

214.739 --> 219.659
discipline gets checked more you know

217.319 --> 221.7
because it's so easy so then then you

219.659 --> 223.85999999999999
have to have the discipline too because

221.7 --> 225.78
for that you have to have the notion

223.86 --> 227.28
about what is going to happen you know

225.78 --> 230.459
because finally when uh the results

227.28 --> 231.239
happen they are painful and no one likes

230.459 --> 234.299
pain

231.239 --> 236.04
everyone goes that thing it's just a

234.299 --> 237.959
Mindless way of doing things without

236.04 --> 240.54
knowing what the consequence will be

237.959 --> 243.08
like yeah there's a guy on YouTube

240.54 --> 245.879
Jordan Maxwell you always say

243.08 --> 248.15900000000002
consequently you know he says that and

245.879 --> 251.04
his sentence after consequently

248.159 --> 253.319
consequently but this is it we were not

251.04 --> 255.78
completely unaware of the consequences

253.319 --> 258.419
of our action we don't care you know

255.78 --> 260.16
most people don't care uh if they do

258.419 --> 264.419
anything because the Earth is doing it

260.16 --> 266.1
and it's like socially accepted also

264.419 --> 267.59999999999997
because because it's gonna come later

266.1 --> 270.6
like consequences come later they don't

267.6 --> 271.74
happen immediately sometimes so so you

270.6 --> 273.18
don't care because it's gonna happen

271.74 --> 276.6
later it's not going to happen right now

273.18 --> 278.52
so so people like that thing that's the

276.6 --> 279.96000000000004
thing which drives them so if it comes

278.52 --> 281.94
later then obviously they'll go to the

279.96 --> 284.28
hospital and there are so many

281.94 --> 287.04
medical hospitals pharmacies everywhere

284.28 --> 288.71999999999997
you know they have the store then if you

287.04 --> 290.34000000000003
see the pharmacies except section in the

288.72 --> 292.139
store it's quite big isn't it like

290.34 --> 294.11999999999995
whenever you go to the stores like

292.139 --> 295.86
that's quite a big section so

294.12 --> 297.12
they have got that they know that that's

295.86 --> 298.08000000000004
going to happen and then you have to go

297.12 --> 300.84000000000003
there and

298.08 --> 303.78
yeah and then you get into the

300.84 --> 306.06
into the hell of call hospital you know

303.78 --> 309.29999999999995
like where they will torture you anyways

306.06 --> 311.34
so and also something I observe and I

309.3 --> 314.759
have like I've done I've started

311.34 --> 316.979
observing I've started observing some uh

314.759 --> 319.38
some people but not just some people uh

316.979 --> 322.32
nature and everything and uh what when

319.38 --> 325.68
we say what goes in often we will feed

322.32 --> 328.62
our plants water for them to grow but

325.68 --> 330.479
then our children or our kids some

328.62 --> 333.06
people they call their children kids

330.479 --> 335.34
because anyway that's another thing but

333.06 --> 338.6
we feed them juice and stuff and

335.34 --> 338.59999999999997
everything but water

354.5 --> 359.58
I don't think it will survive for long

356.82 --> 362.699
yes I mean they should try that and see

359.58 --> 366.38
see what the thing is so yeah but you

362.699 --> 366.38
know this is the kind of stuff that

366.5 --> 370.919
yeah because that requires making

368.639 --> 372.419
connections and making people don't want

370.919 --> 375.479
to do that work to make connections and

372.419 --> 378.419
stuff it requires work it is a

375.479 --> 379.68
discipline to be coherent in that kind

378.419 --> 383.28
of way so

379.68 --> 387.66
yeah and all this has uh also and then

383.28 --> 391.13899999999995
there's an agenda I think behind the

387.66 --> 394.74
getting people to do these rituals uh

391.139 --> 397.38
like eating flesh of animals and stuff

394.74 --> 400.28000000000003
like that there is a you call it here a

397.38 --> 403.74
spirit sapping dependency

400.28 --> 406.02
and there is it's happening in many many

403.74 --> 408.3
uh facets with the pills with the

406.02 --> 411.9
pharmaceutical with the with the the

408.3 --> 414.74
animal eating and stuff like that it's I

411.9 --> 417.419
take the soul away from us the the the

414.74 --> 420.3
conscience and the the power of

417.419 --> 422.75899999999996
reasoning that we have that anyone can

420.3 --> 425.1
come in front of these things and get

422.759 --> 426.66
them I mean the things I've obviously

425.1 --> 429.36
gotten now to cannibalism and stuff like

426.66 --> 431.88000000000005
people are eating being getting more

429.36 --> 434.46000000000004
Cannibal and you know the pills and

431.88 --> 437.21999999999997
stuff are carrying human stuff and

434.46 --> 438.59999999999997
so it's a it's actually got into that

437.22 --> 440.639
thing and people are getting blood

438.6 --> 443.699
transfusions and blood that things of

440.639 --> 445.319
younger people you know like so all of

443.699 --> 448.08000000000004
that is happening so like which is

445.319 --> 450.24
called vampirism and all of the that is

448.08 --> 452.4
all already going on so so all those

450.24 --> 455.34000000000003
things I mean it can't just stop at

452.4 --> 459.06
animals it will go further like once

455.34 --> 460.67999999999995
yeah yeah this is what's happening at

459.06 --> 463.199
one point you know they now they're

460.68 --> 465.12
start putting baby parts and pack scenes

463.199 --> 466.91900000000004
and everything you hear that yeah so so

465.12 --> 468.66
it's it's in every way so the cannibal

466.919 --> 470.639
is thick it reaches cannibalism it

468.66 --> 472.319
doesn't stop there you know once and

470.639 --> 473.819
these things don't stop at one place

472.319 --> 476.819
like if you start going that down that

473.819 --> 478.86
path there's a and then there's more

476.819 --> 481.62
stops in that road and more

478.86 --> 484.02000000000004
things it just doesn't stop there so

481.62 --> 486.18
you know we say often that it's good to

484.02 --> 488.34
reach a certain balance to have balance

486.18 --> 491.40000000000003
in your life and everything do you think

488.34 --> 495.23999999999995
that the spirits or the the

491.4 --> 497.4
solely to all work on Earth is balanced

495.24 --> 500.28000000000003
because I think there is a lot of great

497.4 --> 502.73999999999995
people lots of very we can use the word

500.28 --> 505.31899999999996
spiritual people uh with the

502.74 --> 507.96000000000004
Enlightenment and there is a lot but

505.319 --> 510.78000000000003
there's also a lot of bad people doing

507.96 --> 513.8389999999999
very bad things do you think this whole

510.78 --> 516.659
thing is balancing itself probably like

513.839 --> 518.7600000000001
it's not it's there's no balance exactly

516.659 --> 521.76
right now I mean it's not that and the

518.76 --> 523.74
people who are even waking up right now

521.76 --> 525.8389999999999
they are at a very beginning stages of

523.74 --> 527.7
waking up they are not like anywhere

525.839 --> 529.08
close to enlightened off anything is

527.7 --> 531.72
they're just like a baby

529.08 --> 534.86
steps of waking up they're not at any

531.72 --> 537.12
kind of level which is you know

534.86 --> 538.62
balanced which can balance all of this

537.12 --> 540.0
nonsense out if they that was the case

538.62 --> 540.66
if there were enough people who knew

540.0 --> 543.3
enough

540.66 --> 546.12
and who actually then there are a lot of

543.3 --> 548.5799999999999
changes would happen automatically

546.12 --> 550.5
but that is not the case as yet you know

548.58 --> 551.7
so people are just basically waking up

550.5 --> 553.56
like in the last four or five years

551.7 --> 555.779
people have woken up to some things and

553.56 --> 558.899
stuff like that it's just a starting

555.779 --> 561.18
process of waking up rather than yeah

558.899 --> 563.58
and I was mentioning you actually before

561.18 --> 565.399
and actually as a eBook coming out soon

563.58 --> 567.2
and it's going to be defining

565.399 --> 569.36
magnificence

567.2 --> 572.0400000000001
intermediocrity and calling it

569.36 --> 573.9590000000001
magnificent you know I think that's a

572.04 --> 575.6999999999999
bit what we're doing also

573.959 --> 577.9799999999999
no but obviously yeah obviously because

575.7 --> 580.1400000000001
uh what is like even just the smallest

577.98 --> 582.0
little bit of thing you know people try

580.14 --> 583.3199999999999
try to just they think oh that's great

582.0 --> 585.6
that's great but it's a very little

583.32 --> 587.399
thing like it's like you know like so uh

585.6 --> 588.899
people don't understand that the whole

587.399 --> 590.459
thing is at a very starting point of

588.899 --> 594.48
Awakening and stuff people are just

590.459 --> 596.5189999999999
barely catching uh a little drift like

594.48 --> 598.98
nothing much you know just very

596.519 --> 601.62
beginnings of things like yeah because

598.98 --> 604.14
you go here with unconscious zombies and

601.62 --> 606.12
torture removal I think it's both joined

604.14 --> 607.64
together and that's what you do when

606.12 --> 610.94
you're unconscious you torture yourself

607.64 --> 614.04
but the unconscious and bees I think

610.94 --> 616.5
often you know we prefer we love the

614.04 --> 618.959
fantasy we love the the fantasy about

616.5 --> 622.44
stuff and we just demand more and more

618.959 --> 625.5
and that keeps us in a very distracted

622.44 --> 627.6
and unconscious statement and obviously

625.5 --> 629.64
like I said like Basics are not there

627.6 --> 632.1
okay so the basics are not there what do

629.64 --> 634.38
you have your life has no bearing or

632.1 --> 636.0600000000001
anything to hold on to then anything can

634.38 --> 638.1
you can be swayed by anything like

636.06 --> 640.6199999999999
there's nothing you don't have a ground

638.1 --> 643.74
to stand on actually you're not standing

640.62 --> 644.88
on any firm ground so when you're

643.74 --> 646.32
standing on any firm ground you're

644.88 --> 648.779
wobbling

646.32 --> 650.339
and after that anybody can throw

648.779 --> 651.6
anything at you and you don't know like

650.339 --> 652.6800000000001
and I can totally understand the

651.6 --> 654.66
situation in the west like Canada

652.68 --> 657.3
America or any all those places that

654.66 --> 660.18
there is nothing in terms of Basics so

657.3 --> 662.3389999999999
then people are very lost I would uh

660.18 --> 664.8
call it very a law situation where

662.339 --> 666.0600000000001
people don't have any kind of even a

664.8 --> 669.66
starting point

666.06 --> 672.899
or like actually getting a bearing you

669.66 --> 674.64
know of any kind so yeah something I was

672.899 --> 676.56
thinking about I think it's last summer

674.64 --> 678.54
it came through my awareness and I was

676.56 --> 680.9399999999999
looking around and I was reading stuff

678.54 --> 683.579
and you know the the rubber we have on

680.94 --> 685.44
our shoes you know they do insulate us

683.579 --> 687.0
from the current of the Earth the

685.44 --> 689.6400000000001
cellular current I think it's called

687.0 --> 691.38
yeah this is very crazy now when you

689.64 --> 693.42
come to a society and you say everyone

691.38 --> 695.7
especially in the summer when it's up

693.42 --> 698.279
they all have shoes and isolate

695.7 --> 701.0
themselves like we isolate ourselves

698.279 --> 703.079
from the great vibration of the Earth

701.0 --> 704.76
yeah for that you have to be unconscious

703.079 --> 707.399
I mean I mean people can give you things

704.76 --> 709.86
but finally nobody can put a shoe on you

707.399 --> 711.959
a company can make a shoe but they can't

709.86 --> 713.88
actually physically come and put it on

711.959 --> 716.16
to you you will have to do that yourself

713.88 --> 718.019
so at some point it's your decision

716.16 --> 720.12
whether you're going to do it or not

718.019 --> 721.98
using and it's not easy to put a shoe on

720.12 --> 724.92
and you have to it takes time

721.98 --> 727.5
to put a shoe on I mean so I mean and

724.92 --> 729.54
it's so it's so hard also to learn to

727.5 --> 732.3
make the the bow and stuff when we're

729.54 --> 734.88
young we we struggle a lot with that I

732.3 --> 736.8
remember it's like learning to to write

734.88 --> 738.3
or stuff like you struggle making that

736.8 --> 739.38
thing why they make it so hard and

738.3 --> 741.5999999999999
complicated

739.38 --> 743.579
yeah I mean uh like the the point is

741.6 --> 745.8000000000001
like even if you make it so hard people

743.579 --> 747.4799999999999
are safe gonna do it that's that shows

745.8 --> 749.04
the level of unconscious basically

747.48 --> 750.5
that's yeah they're gonna figure it out

749.04 --> 753.66
yeah yeah

750.5 --> 755.579
there's enough time to figure it out

753.66 --> 756.92
like yeah but yeah we have a thousand

755.579 --> 760.079
years

756.92 --> 761.3389999999999
come on yeah yeah I mean what I'm saying

760.079 --> 762.8389999999999
is while they're picking up the shoes

761.339 --> 764.7600000000001
like enough time to figure it out at the

762.839 --> 766.32
time okay you know you are looking at it

764.76 --> 768.66
you're concentrating on it you can focus

766.32 --> 770.22
whether you need this or not to go to

768.66 --> 772.019
the Garden you know like people go to

770.22 --> 776.1600000000001
the park then this is gonna wear that

772.019 --> 778.92
like so yeah yeah my son Gavin is a very

776.16 --> 780.6
a big on this he walks barefoot all the

778.92 --> 782.639
time and that's what we said it's a good

780.6 --> 785.4590000000001
thing stay like that automatic

782.639 --> 788.279
Consciousness automatic Consciousness I

785.459 --> 791.2199999999999
don't think you me I I say it often

788.279 --> 792.72
you're born Dead with life here so you

791.22 --> 795.1800000000001
got to bring yourself to life and

792.72 --> 797.22
Consciousness is not an automatic thing

795.18 --> 800.16
most people I

797.22 --> 803.1600000000001
am I going too far by saying that most

800.16 --> 805.62
are like there is deep unconsciousness

803.16 --> 807.779
and normal unconsciousness like I think

805.62 --> 810.24
we're all pretty much like sometimes I

807.779 --> 812.16
still feel a bit but I'm conscious I

810.24 --> 814.44
think a little bit more but I still feel

812.16 --> 817.26
like under it knows some time and stuff

814.44 --> 820.74
like is Am I Wrong by saying that we're

817.26 --> 823.019
all but some of us are awake and very

820.74 --> 825.0
enlightened like you I don't consider

823.019 --> 827.94
you as unconscious but

825.0 --> 829.98
am I going too far by saying this I mean

827.94 --> 831.48
the thing is that uh when you're coming

829.98 --> 833.1
out from unconscious like completely

831.48 --> 835.38
unconscious like full sleep let's say

833.1 --> 838.26
then when you wake up there's stages to

835.38 --> 839.82
waking up you know I mean so so even

838.26 --> 842.1
people wake up like but it's not gonna

839.82 --> 843.72
happen by itself like you have to put in

842.1 --> 844.9200000000001
the work like that's what I meant that

843.72 --> 847.44
you will have to actually put in the

844.92 --> 849.779
work to gain consciousness

847.44 --> 851.7
you will have to put in the effort to

849.779 --> 853.32
gain Consciousness so it's not just like

851.7 --> 854.399
automatically you're sitting around just

853.32 --> 856.019
because everyone else is getting

854.399 --> 858.18
conscious you'll get conscious too

856.019 --> 861.0
because others are getting conscious

858.18 --> 862.62
yeah the monkey effect hey maybe that's

861.0 --> 864.42
gonna work maybe that's gonna work with

862.62 --> 866.04
Consciousness people will become

864.42 --> 867.959
conscious now

866.04 --> 870.66
yeah yeah but it's not gonna happen you

867.959 --> 872.16
will have to actually put yourself uh

870.66 --> 873.7199999999999
along with it it's not like you know

872.16 --> 875.04
that's what some people are hoping that

873.72 --> 876.72
you know that people like to be just

875.04 --> 878.8199999999999
carried along with the crowd

876.72 --> 881.519
but this is not a crowd thing you know

878.82 --> 883.9200000000001
where you just get carried up along with

881.519 --> 886.92
the crowd you will have to actually uh

883.92 --> 890.0999999999999
like put your time attention

886.92 --> 892.5
all of these things onto it you know you

890.1 --> 893.6990000000001
have to give it your time intention it

892.5 --> 895.86
cannot happen without your time and

893.699 --> 897.779
tension and your effort it's not and why

895.86 --> 900.0600000000001
what I mean Diamond attention only

897.779 --> 904.019
so all those things are very necessary

900.06 --> 906.06
and you cannot not do that so the

904.019 --> 907.8
holistic effort from Basics to time to

906.06 --> 909.3599999999999
attention you have to do everything

907.8 --> 911.04
to become more conscious you know

909.36 --> 913.139
because it has to be earned

911.04 --> 914.76
it's not a thing which is just like you

913.139 --> 916.8
know like which is just gonna be like

914.76 --> 918.54
shower at you from The Happening a lot

916.8 --> 920.519
of people are saying like okay there'll

918.54 --> 922.5
be some event in the sky or something

920.519 --> 923.399
then people will get conscious just

922.5 --> 925.92
because

923.399 --> 927.6
that event happens uh it doesn't work

925.92 --> 929.399
like that I mean you suddenly just don't

927.6 --> 931.1990000000001
get all of the sense

929.399 --> 933.24
from no sense

931.199 --> 935.459
like Suddenly by some event or anything

933.24 --> 937.5600000000001
like you know I mean yourself also you

935.459 --> 940.56
notice it has been in stages a process

937.56 --> 942.66
it has been a process it's not a one day

940.56 --> 945.899
thing like it's not a one moment

942.66 --> 948.54
instantaneous thing like so no no no

945.899 --> 953.639
it's a day-to-day process for sure yeah

948.54 --> 956.519
yeah the art of deliberate ignoring and

953.639 --> 959.76
this I think it's not so hard to observe

956.519 --> 961.92
this Art In Motion just go out in baby

959.76 --> 964.26
land like go for a walk go for a stroll

961.92 --> 966.66
go to the grocery store go in to public

964.26 --> 969.66
trains go anywhere where there's public

966.66 --> 972.18
and people ignore you they don't even

969.66 --> 974.699
look at you they don't they it's like

972.18 --> 977.3389999999999
they are in a bubble and there's nothing

974.699 --> 979.62
this is what's very very shocking

977.339 --> 982.8000000000001
sometime and everybody can notice that

979.62 --> 985.5
and that's what I tried not to do

982.8 --> 987.3599999999999
anymore I try yeah but sometimes people

985.5 --> 989.279
just ignore you even when I go for a

987.36 --> 990.779
walk sometime I look at people I smile

989.279 --> 992.399
but they don't smile they ignore you

990.779 --> 995.16
they don't like it

992.399 --> 997.199
you're a stranger or something or like

995.16 --> 1000.019
you have to understand that if they are

997.199 --> 1002.7199999999999
ignoring nature itself which they are in

1000.019 --> 1004.1
which they are living in then uh once

1002.72 --> 1006.259
they start ignoring that then they'll

1004.1 --> 1008.899
start ignoring anything because it's

1006.259 --> 1011.12
very hard to ignore the nature and then

1008.899 --> 1013.519
comes the you know like elephant in the

1011.12 --> 1014.899
room like like they can ignore the

1013.519 --> 1016.639
elephant in the room right now as well

1014.899 --> 1019.459
like you know whatever is happening the

1016.639 --> 1021.5
whole a big thing you know which is the

1019.459 --> 1024.62
Consciousness in that thing and like so

1021.5 --> 1025.939
like I mean uh like even my channel you

1024.62 --> 1028.04
know like you total solution used to get

1025.939 --> 1029.9
just 1500 views like that kind of things

1028.04 --> 1030.98
and I mean it was pretty much ignored

1029.9 --> 1033.14
most of the time

1030.98 --> 1035.48
on YouTube you know like it was totally

1033.14 --> 1038.419
completely ignored for years like 10

1035.48 --> 1041.78
years like completely ignored uh I mean

1038.419 --> 1044.1200000000001
uh people are very good at that kind of

1041.78 --> 1045.319
thing because uh they they that that's

1044.12 --> 1046.6989999999998
how they shelter themselves it's called

1045.319 --> 1047.8999999999999
Uh like you know like putting the head

1046.699 --> 1050.059
in the sand

1047.9 --> 1052.22
you know like the Austria puts the head

1050.059 --> 1053.6
in the sand and doesn't see anything and

1052.22 --> 1056.96
if they think they think if they don't

1053.6 --> 1059.6599999999999
see anything it won't affect them

1056.96 --> 1061.94
if they don't see anything it's a it's a

1059.66 --> 1063.8600000000001
mental disease

1061.94 --> 1065.78
and it's a misperception where you think

1063.86 --> 1067.3999999999999
that just because you don't see it it

1065.78 --> 1071.02
won't affect you

1067.4 --> 1074.72
you know yeah so but that's right

1071.02 --> 1076.34
just like if uh some um like a big big

1074.72 --> 1077.539
beast is coming towards you and you

1076.34 --> 1079.3999999999999
close your eyes

1077.539 --> 1081.679
and then you think okay it's gonna go

1079.4 --> 1084.679
away now just because you close your

1081.679 --> 1087.44
eyes like you know so but it doesn't

1084.679 --> 1088.94
work like that you know so yeah

1087.44 --> 1090.8600000000001
it's like people are afraid to face

1088.94 --> 1093.2
reality

1090.86 --> 1096.26
beings afraid to face reality and that

1093.2 --> 1099.14
carries on forward to other things and

1096.26 --> 1101.96
yeah and also like sometimes I'm afraid

1099.14 --> 1103.88
also to expand the perspective that they

1101.96 --> 1106.58
have on the reality and on certain

1103.88 --> 1109.0390000000002
events and stuff like just an example my

1106.58 --> 1110.78
my wife come back home the other day

1109.039 --> 1112.94
from the daycare where she works and she

1110.78 --> 1116.66
said oh we found a bottle of pills and a

1112.94 --> 1118.3400000000001
Kinder Surprise egg on a children the

1116.66 --> 1119.96
whole daycare was in commotion they

1118.34 --> 1122.539
called the parents and everything and

1119.96 --> 1126.919
said I'm sitting at the table I'm like

1122.539 --> 1128.179
okay okay but what about the scrap that

1126.919 --> 1131.179
the parents feeding their children

1128.179 --> 1133.2800000000002
probably because if the bottle of pills

1131.179 --> 1135.5590000000002
ended up at the daycare the parents are

1133.28 --> 1137.6
surely not very focused not very paying

1135.559 --> 1139.3999999999999
attention and stuff like that so you

1137.6 --> 1142.3999999999999
know this is sometimes putting things in

1139.4 --> 1144.44
perspective and you realize that

1142.4 --> 1147.2800000000002
sometimes if you're Madness to react

1144.44 --> 1151.299
about stuff like that not obviously

1147.28 --> 1154.16
but to extrapolate to it come on there's

1151.299 --> 1156.98
worse things in life than that than that

1154.16 --> 1158.96
I'm sure they being torture a lot worse

1156.98 --> 1160.82
by the the food they ingest and stuff

1158.96 --> 1161.9
you know what I mean yeah but if the

1160.82 --> 1163.8799999999999
point is like the parents don't they

1161.9 --> 1166.1000000000001
can't take care of themselves so I mean

1163.88 --> 1168.8200000000002
to expect them to take care of the uh

1166.1 --> 1171.3799999999999
kids or their offspring yes that's it it

1168.82 --> 1173.48
doesn't make any sense like because they

1171.38 --> 1174.7990000000002
can't take care of themselves so like I

1173.48 --> 1177.02
mean how are they supposed to take care

1174.799 --> 1178.82
of that I mean that just is not even a

1177.02 --> 1182.299
question that that it is going to happen

1178.82 --> 1184.3999999999999
like so uh I mean I mean people are not

1182.299 --> 1186.2
like getting themselves together on

1184.4 --> 1188.1200000000001
having getting a grip or handle on life

1186.2 --> 1190.3400000000001
before they decide to have babies or

1188.12 --> 1192.9799999999998
it's not the case like that people are

1190.34 --> 1196.8799999999999
like okay I know now what to do on this

1192.98 --> 1199.1
Earth and then I can teach that too my

1196.88 --> 1202.7600000000002
Offspring like it's not like that so

1199.1 --> 1205.039
now boring and interesting okay this is

1202.76 --> 1206.84
very interesting this is very

1205.039 --> 1209.36
interesting because some people would

1206.84 --> 1211.22
say that what we do is boring yeah yeah

1209.36 --> 1213.559
that's what they would say because it's

1211.22 --> 1215.66
not something about distraction it

1213.559 --> 1218.72
doesn't keep their mind

1215.66 --> 1221.419
unplug and so they they probably judge

1218.72 --> 1223.039
this as very boring but I think it

1221.419 --> 1225.26
there's a difference to be made between

1223.039 --> 1227.66
what is interesting where we should put

1225.26 --> 1230.919
our interests and what is boring

1227.66 --> 1233.8400000000001
honestly I mean the point is

1230.919 --> 1236.1200000000001
boring yeah but the point is what is

1233.84 --> 1238.3999999999999
boring is actually like when you're not

1236.12 --> 1240.02
evolving like when you're not learning

1238.4 --> 1242.72
continuously something okay that is

1240.02 --> 1244.46
boring okay like which is not new like I

1242.72 --> 1247.1000000000001
mean if you go in what is interesting is

1244.46 --> 1250.28
where this new thing is which has got uh

1247.1 --> 1252.86
which has got more things to it which is

1250.28 --> 1255.2
more exciting anything new new knowledge

1252.86 --> 1257.8999999999999
new that thing that is exciting like new

1255.2 --> 1259.5800000000002
growing uh feeling better is I mean

1257.9 --> 1261.2
that's like if somebody says like okay

1259.58 --> 1263.96
if I'm feeling healthy

1261.2 --> 1265.94
okay that is boring feeling healthy

1263.96 --> 1267.32
then you need a disease or something to

1265.94 --> 1270.919
make it more interesting

1267.32 --> 1272.8999999999999
I mean what are you calling but some

1270.919 --> 1274.88
people have that kind of mindset

1272.9 --> 1276.5590000000002
yeah yeah I mean but then you'll come to

1274.88 --> 1278.6000000000001
know when our interest in the disease is

1276.559 --> 1280.16
I mean you will come to know what the

1278.6 --> 1282.98
interesting is about it

1280.16 --> 1284.96
you know because I mean I mean uh

1282.98 --> 1287.299
interesting will be more and more Health

1284.96 --> 1289.1000000000001
like or more feeling better

1287.299 --> 1291.26
in your being like that is more

1289.1 --> 1294.32
interesting than you know so uh those

1291.26 --> 1295.94
definitions have to be understood and

1294.32 --> 1299.24
clearly applied you know like these kind

1295.94 --> 1302.919
of things so yeah now one of the biggest

1299.24 --> 1305.78
biggest addiction the only real epidemic

1302.919 --> 1308.0590000000002
is you see it here gaining attention

1305.78 --> 1309.98
from others and this is what I was

1308.059 --> 1313.039
saying the other day and this you can

1309.98 --> 1315.919
see it on social media easily like what

1313.039 --> 1318.32
I would do to solve that uh maybe to

1315.919 --> 1321.3200000000002
help people cure their their addiction

1318.32 --> 1323.96
because it's an addiction you take out

1321.32 --> 1326.36
the metrics like uh Instagram YouTube

1323.96 --> 1328.58
fake book all this you take out the

1326.36 --> 1330.74
Matrix the likes the numbers take this

1328.58 --> 1334.039
all out the followers take all this out

1330.74 --> 1336.74
for everyone on Earth no more Matrix on

1334.039 --> 1339.62
social media try this yeah and this yeah

1336.74 --> 1341.72
help cure the addiction a little bit

1339.62 --> 1343.2199999999998
I mean it's not like people before this

1341.72 --> 1344.96
happened people had that thing that they

1343.22 --> 1347.1200000000001
they can go become leaders they can

1344.96 --> 1349.039
become they can come to main mainstream

1347.12 --> 1350.4799999999998
media there was always options

1349.039 --> 1353.179
to gain

1350.48 --> 1355.4
yeah like it's not like it started with

1353.179 --> 1357.679
the internet okay free internet there

1355.4 --> 1359.539
was enough of that impact in fact

1357.679 --> 1360.799
internet uh made it more that thing so

1359.539 --> 1362.24
that people could actually bring out

1360.799 --> 1365.4189999999999
some information or something rather

1362.24 --> 1367.1
than just uh playing that game like

1365.419 --> 1370.64
earlier that used to be that game only

1367.1 --> 1373.039
and nothing else you know so so like

1370.64 --> 1375.14
it's not just to blame it's like uh

1373.039 --> 1377.059
people point point is this like if

1375.14 --> 1379.8200000000002
people want attention that's fine okay

1377.059 --> 1381.559
like okay yeah you want attention you

1379.82 --> 1382.46
got attention people's attention now

1381.559 --> 1384.3799999999999
what

1382.46 --> 1386.3600000000001
what are you gonna do now what are you

1384.38 --> 1388.64
gonna say to them okay you got their

1386.36 --> 1390.559
attention okay now what do you have

1388.64 --> 1392.9
something to say to them what's the

1390.559 --> 1395.299
point is there a point

1392.9 --> 1397.159
to it like

1395.299 --> 1400.039
I mean that's the whole point like like

1397.159 --> 1401.8400000000001
okay you got attention of now you will

1400.039 --> 1403.58
have to like do something you know

1401.84 --> 1404.72
because attention is on you like you're

1403.58 --> 1407.1789999999999
on stage

1404.72 --> 1410.299
and 100 000 people are looking at you

1407.179 --> 1411.6200000000001
then what like like what are you gonna

1410.299 --> 1412.94
tell them

1411.62 --> 1414.32
so either you can tell them something

1412.94 --> 1416.179
which is good for them which will

1414.32 --> 1418.3999999999999
involve them or you can say something

1416.179 --> 1420.44
which takes them down

1418.4 --> 1423.5590000000002
along with you like okay

1420.44 --> 1425.539
those are your two options okay and for

1423.559 --> 1428.24
that you'll have to know what to say to

1425.539 --> 1430.34
them so and like if you don't know for

1428.24 --> 1432.6200000000001
yourself then there's no point to going

1430.34 --> 1434.299
up there and standing up in front of

1432.62 --> 1436.82
that many people or getting so much

1434.299 --> 1439.82
attention and then like confusing the

1436.82 --> 1441.74
hell out of them or taking them down you

1439.82 --> 1443.6
know like with you like which is what is

1441.74 --> 1446.059
called like concerts and things like

1443.6 --> 1447.5
that you know I mean so many people go

1446.059 --> 1449.24
on stage in concerts and stuff like what

1447.5 --> 1452.48
do they tell people what are the songs

1449.24 --> 1454.52
about what is the like

1452.48 --> 1457.58
what is actually going on like out there

1454.52 --> 1458.6
like you know so so so that's why he's

1457.58 --> 1460.58
like

1458.6 --> 1463.2199999999998
I think PT it's a bit also the

1460.58 --> 1465.799
difference between getting attention and

1463.22 --> 1468.08
giving attention like you say if you go

1465.799 --> 1470.96
on stage if you bring me like on stage

1468.08 --> 1473.24
to do a speech or something my uh

1470.96 --> 1475.82
feeling about this will not be to get

1473.24 --> 1478.34
attention but to give attention to

1475.82 --> 1480.559
higher and divine not to the people so

1478.34 --> 1482.78
much in the stage or in the room or

1480.559 --> 1484.76
because you don't know how people get

1482.78 --> 1487.28
your message and stuff but if you give

1484.76 --> 1489.799
attention I think to higher and divine

1487.28 --> 1492.5
like you say and really focus on this I

1489.799 --> 1495.26
think all the rest will come to you in

1492.5 --> 1498.2
the words and all this and you will not

1495.26 --> 1501.08
seek attention you will uh

1498.2 --> 1503.299
try to earn respect more than seek

1501.08 --> 1504.559
attention yes yes I mean obviously

1503.299 --> 1505.52
because the point is that I have to have

1504.559 --> 1507.32
some purpose

1505.52 --> 1509.24
if any interaction is happening it has

1507.32 --> 1511.1589999999999
to have some purpose like and purpose

1509.24 --> 1513.38
should only be Evolution like it should

1511.159 --> 1515.72
be like useful for everyone involved

1513.38 --> 1519.0800000000002
like it should not be something which is

1515.72 --> 1520.52
not useful for beings so like if it's

1519.08 --> 1521.8999999999999
use this activity and the only thing

1520.52 --> 1525.1
which comes out of that is people get

1521.9 --> 1525.1000000000001
some people get attention

1527.539 --> 1533.419
there's no Rhyme or Reason about it you

1530.36 --> 1534.74
know but it's just uh that people are

1533.419 --> 1536.6000000000001
just getting attention and for no Rhyme

1534.74 --> 1538.58
or Reason and then they are affecting

1536.6 --> 1540.32
people in a negative way

1538.58 --> 1541.6999999999998
the way they are getting attention

1540.32 --> 1543.86
okay and the way they are their

1541.7 --> 1545.539
personality their being is giving out

1543.86 --> 1547.58
the wrong signals

1545.539 --> 1550.039
to other people

1547.58 --> 1551.6589999999999
so so that is actually a very negative

1550.039 --> 1554.179
Karma actually it's a it's the most

1551.659 --> 1556.5800000000002
negative Karma you can do on this Earth

1554.179 --> 1558.98
actually this is there is a no more

1556.58 --> 1561.32
negative Karma than that

1558.98 --> 1564.38
and that touch a bit that jumping and

1561.32 --> 1566.1789999999999
yelling also that you put after because

1564.38 --> 1568.64
that's what people do they go on stage

1566.179 --> 1570.5590000000002
and they uh like especially with the

1568.64 --> 1573.6200000000001
music industry then you see it a lot

1570.559 --> 1575.8999999999999
like why exactly are you singing about

1573.62 --> 1578.1789999999999
and why are you getting he likes that's

1575.9 --> 1580.8200000000002
what you say then like sometimes just to

1578.179 --> 1582.679
get attention I mean it starts from a

1580.82 --> 1583.9399999999998
very good level you know like I think

1582.679 --> 1585.38
four or five years old they start

1583.94 --> 1587.48
screaming and crying to get their

1585.38 --> 1589.22
parents attention you know they start

1587.48 --> 1590.9
jumping and yelling I think this starts

1589.22 --> 1593.96
at a very young age

1590.9 --> 1595.76
so if it's not uh stopped at that age

1593.96 --> 1598.3400000000001
then by the time you grow up it will

1595.76 --> 1600.44
become more and more of a problem like I

1598.34 --> 1602.4189999999999
think in the west uh this happens at a

1600.44 --> 1605.48
very young age anyways like you know

1602.419 --> 1607.039
like kids think it's okay to jump and

1605.48 --> 1609.4
yell to get attention whether from

1607.039 --> 1612.2
parents also the school Society anything

1609.4 --> 1614.6000000000001
they think it's the it's an okay thing

1612.2 --> 1617.659
to do you know so like

1614.6 --> 1620.6589999999999
so now there is something happening also

1617.659 --> 1623.659
like we're very very big on Assurance

1620.659 --> 1626.48
like having Insurance Assurance this and

1623.659 --> 1628.1000000000001
that and the mass in masses and I think

1626.48 --> 1631.1200000000001
that that's what's happening there is

1628.1 --> 1634.52
like you say here A whole net of Mutual

1631.12 --> 1636.62
Assurance in place to keep the ego

1634.52 --> 1640.34
afloat

1636.62 --> 1641.6
yes I mean you don't need to I mean you

1640.34 --> 1642.86
need you need to hear that like because

1641.6 --> 1644.539
people here it's going to be all right

1642.86 --> 1645.74
it's going to be all right you know I

1644.539 --> 1648.02
mean I don't know how many songs are

1645.74 --> 1649.64
there like at least there are 100 000

1648.02 --> 1650.9
songs which just which have this it's

1649.64 --> 1652.7
gonna be all right it's all right it's

1650.9 --> 1655.1000000000001
gonna be all right I mean I think that

1652.7 --> 1657.74
is the most repeated line in songs even

1655.1 --> 1660.6789999999999
like if if you go through the lyrics of

1657.74 --> 1663.08
things that is a major line in the like

1660.679 --> 1664.039
majority of the songs but I mean how is

1663.08 --> 1666.26
it going to be all right when you're not

1664.039 --> 1667.76
doing anything to be all right how is

1666.26 --> 1670.279
this going to be all right automatically

1667.76 --> 1672.08
like you know like you have to do

1670.279 --> 1673.46
something to get all right like it's not

1672.08 --> 1675.6789999999999
just gonna get all right just like that

1673.46 --> 1678.38
just because you are saying so you know

1675.679 --> 1680.0590000000002
like I mean uh so the whole Assurance

1678.38 --> 1681.98
thing is because people know that

1680.059 --> 1684.799
they're in a wrong they know that they

1681.98 --> 1687.44
are in a like a sinking Titanic okay

1684.799 --> 1689.84
like so in a singing Titanic you need to

1687.44 --> 1692.3600000000001
have give each other Assurance you know

1689.84 --> 1693.62
like and uh that that thing is what's

1692.36 --> 1694.8799999999999
happening instead of trying to figure

1693.62 --> 1697.3999999999999
out some solution

1694.88 --> 1699.74
you know like so it's it's it's like uh

1697.4 --> 1700.8200000000002
that thing where it's everyone knows

1699.74 --> 1702.919
there is a problem

1700.82 --> 1704.8999999999999
there is a trouble and that's why

1702.919 --> 1706.5200000000002
they're seeking Assurance uh they are

1704.9 --> 1708.98
not happy they are not they know they're

1706.52 --> 1711.5
in a maze and a problem and that thing

1708.98 --> 1712.94
and then others are giving each other

1711.5 --> 1715.34
like patting themselves on the back that

1712.94 --> 1717.799
it's okay it's okay it's okay but this

1715.34 --> 1721.4599999999998
all this okay thing actually stops uh

1717.799 --> 1723.3799999999999
being from taking any proactive action

1721.46 --> 1725.539
towards actually bettering the situation

1723.38 --> 1726.679
or trying to escape the criticism or

1725.539 --> 1728.539
anything like that

1726.679 --> 1729.6200000000001
because then you just don't have the

1728.539 --> 1732.44
incentive

1729.62 --> 1734.4799999999998
you just get calmed implicated by these

1732.44 --> 1737.48
kind of things so this location is not

1734.48 --> 1740.059
good for anyone in the end you know but

1737.48 --> 1742.039
the society is built upon that basically

1740.059 --> 1744.26
because at some level everyone knows

1742.039 --> 1745.52
that every this is all wrong like so

1744.26 --> 1747.08
like

1745.52 --> 1750.44
that's why the Assurance is required

1747.08 --> 1752.96
even more exact and it's like avoidance

1750.44 --> 1758.2
mixed with the low level of awareness

1752.96 --> 1760.46
and this is very a big torture big time

1758.2 --> 1762.38
yes and that's why Assurance is required

1760.46 --> 1764.059
you know like you know everybody is

1762.38 --> 1766.22
going to get hurt everybody's gonna get

1764.059 --> 1768.62
pain so you start assuring them already

1766.22 --> 1772.52
look it's okay if you get it it's okay

1768.62 --> 1774.799
like yeah everyone gets it the other

1772.52 --> 1777.32
people go to the Garden so

1774.799 --> 1780.08
yeah so we have we have an insurance for

1777.32 --> 1782.96
that so we're fine yeah yeah now

1780.08 --> 1785.899
buildings the next one is buildings and

1782.96 --> 1787.46
this is something that look uh just look

1785.899 --> 1790.399
around that's all we have is buildings

1787.46 --> 1793.3990000000001
and people seems to like the idea of a

1790.399 --> 1795.9799999999998
paradise for many people is uh that the

1793.399 --> 1798.9799999999998
grocery store the shopping mall or going

1795.98 --> 1801.799
to shop at Texas restaurant and the the

1798.98 --> 1804.26
big thing like there's a big uh place

1801.799 --> 1808.039
here I don't know their stores they're

1804.26 --> 1809.899
so crazy like there's so many stores so

1808.039 --> 1814.539
many stores and some people that that's

1809.899 --> 1814.539
all the DC is buildings buildings and

1819.32 --> 1822.9189999999999
which is the body

1820.82 --> 1824.899
yeah they have a building too which is

1822.919 --> 1827.1200000000001
called body and they don't have much

1824.899 --> 1828.86
attention on it so and they don't take

1827.12 --> 1831.9189999999999
care of it so then the external

1828.86 --> 1833.6589999999999
buildings become more important to them

1831.919 --> 1836.0
because they're not taking care of that

1833.659 --> 1839.0
building so that's where the whole

1836.0 --> 1840.559
Fascination for this uh because uh like

1839.0 --> 1842.419
you're not taking care of the body but

1840.559 --> 1846.559
then the building can keep big and clean

1842.419 --> 1849.2
so and shiny and uh you can keep it like

1846.559 --> 1850.94
that and you know so when you forget

1849.2 --> 1852.8600000000001
about your own bottle

1850.94 --> 1853.8200000000002
and what's happening with it it's a

1852.86 --> 1856.4599999999998
distraction

1853.82 --> 1858.86
created from one's own building

1856.46 --> 1861.919
which is one's body and building one's

1858.86 --> 1862.9399999999998
own future or doing anything for one

1861.919 --> 1865.88
spirit

1862.94 --> 1868.279
like Jim saying that that building is

1865.88 --> 1869.6000000000001
not focused on then this external

1868.279 --> 1872.0
buildings become

1869.6 --> 1873.559
take up that thing and even in that

1872.0 --> 1875.48
building they don't know what a good

1873.559 --> 1878.24
building should be or what a building is

1875.48 --> 1881.059
with which actually will improve your

1878.24 --> 1882.74
sense like if you walk into it which

1881.059 --> 1884.24
will improve your body electrics or

1882.74 --> 1886.279
electromagnetics they don't know what

1884.24 --> 1890.1200000000001
the science of uh building a proper

1886.279 --> 1893.36
building is either so so so it's a it's

1890.12 --> 1895.52
like a like a lack of knowledge on all

1893.36 --> 1898.1
levels you know so

1895.52 --> 1899.96
so what I find good right now is

1898.1 --> 1901.6999999999998
actually harmful for them you know like

1899.96 --> 1903.08
these buildings are not actually like

1901.7 --> 1905.8990000000001
those with his lights and the shopping

1903.08 --> 1907.6399999999999
malls and stuff like it's not exactly a

1905.899 --> 1909.26
good thing for the body so

1907.64 --> 1910.76
so they don't understand that like if

1909.26 --> 1912.62
you go to the store supermarkets which

1910.76 --> 1914.74
you're talking about I mean you can get

1912.62 --> 1918.1399999999999
a headache in half an hour like if you

1914.74 --> 1920.72
actually are sensitive enough like you

1918.14 --> 1924.76
know to when you go inside them so yeah

1920.72 --> 1926.8990000000001
you know something I observe also is uh

1924.76 --> 1929.6589999999999
something I think it's pretty much

1926.899 --> 1932.6
everywhere the Pusha Latin Society the

1929.659 --> 1934.3990000000001
house and the car if you go to the bank

1932.6 --> 1937.399
like here if you go to the bank in

1934.399 --> 1940.76
Canada you can get a loan to buy a house

1937.399 --> 1943.6399999999999
you can get a loan to buy a car but you

1940.76 --> 1946.399
cannot get a loan to do the groceries or

1943.64 --> 1948.8600000000001
get along to buy a dog or get a loan to

1946.399 --> 1950.779
do anything else to buy a whatever you

1948.86 --> 1954.1999999999998
want to do like you can have a personal

1950.779 --> 1956.48
loan but they don't call it grocery loan

1954.2 --> 1959.24
like the one for the car it's a car loan

1956.48 --> 1961.88
the one for the house is a mortgage but

1959.24 --> 1964.64
so they push a lot the car in the house

1961.88 --> 1967.7600000000002
and now we're talking about the house of

1964.64 --> 1971.0590000000002
the body and the vehicle the body is a

1967.76 --> 1973.64
vehicle as much as the house so I think

1971.059 --> 1976.76
this is the idea behind it is to get us

1973.64 --> 1979.7
so much into an external house and an

1976.76 --> 1983.12
external vehicle that was completely

1979.7 --> 1985.3990000000001
detached from our own and this we lose

1983.12 --> 1987.1399999999999
the alignment because you bring your car

1985.399 --> 1989.4189999999999
to the garage to get a line so it

1987.14 --> 1990.7
doesn't go in the ditch yeah yeah yeah

1989.419 --> 1992.8400000000001
yeah

1990.7 --> 1995.779
but but you don't do that with your body

1992.84 --> 1998.059
like that's my point like the the focus

1995.779 --> 2000.1
from your own body finishes

1998.059 --> 2001.299
the more and more your focus is taken

2000.1 --> 2003.34
from your own body into something else

2001.299 --> 2004.72
you know and people have to pay the

2003.34 --> 2006.76
mortgage back or something like that

2004.72 --> 2008.679
that's all they're focusing on they're

2006.76 --> 2012.1589999999999
not focusing on their own body like I

2008.679 --> 2013.779
mean yeah I mean yeah so so so so that's

2012.159 --> 2015.3990000000001
that's the thing like and the funny

2013.779 --> 2016.659
thing is the house they'll give you is

2015.399 --> 2018.6399999999999
nothing which will be good for your body

2016.659 --> 2020.7600000000002
it will be not something which will

2018.64 --> 2022.72
enhance your body's

2020.76 --> 2024.76
electromagnetics your body has

2022.72 --> 2027.64
electromagnetic field and whatever

2024.76 --> 2030.34
structure you're inside

2027.64 --> 2032.98
should be aiding that instead of taking

2030.34 --> 2034.899
away from that you know so and all these

2032.98 --> 2036.519
so-called houses right now are not

2034.899 --> 2037.899
adding to your electromagnetically they

2036.519 --> 2039.279
are taking away from it and everything

2037.899 --> 2040.7199999999998
inside them so

2039.279 --> 2042.519
so that's a big problem that's called

2040.72 --> 2044.6200000000001
it's an architectural problem that's a

2042.519 --> 2046.779
material materials problem it's a

2044.62 --> 2049.359
material science architecture issue okay

2046.779 --> 2050.74
and uh like that's where they don't

2049.359 --> 2052.96
allow for natural architecture or

2050.74 --> 2054.7599999999998
natural materials and all of that which

2052.96 --> 2057.04
will actually help you

2054.76 --> 2059.26
stay healthier in in a better mental

2057.04 --> 2062.2
state and so it's not like structures

2059.26 --> 2064.8390000000004
can't be made which are helpful for you

2062.2 --> 2066.7
but for that also like implementation

2064.839 --> 2069.22
knowledge and everything is required for

2066.7 --> 2072.2799999999997
that so

2069.22 --> 2074.859
no it's it's very tragic the way we

2072.28 --> 2076.78
build houses here and it's so isolated

2074.859 --> 2079.119
you know that's what I noticed a lot

2076.78 --> 2081.7000000000003
there's a lot of isolation I know it's

2079.119 --> 2084.82
called like everything has sharp Corners

2081.7 --> 2089.02
top edges uh that thing and uh wrong

2084.82 --> 2090.3990000000003
ratios wrong materials like power lines

2089.02 --> 2093.099
going any which way like they do the

2090.399 --> 2094.1189999999997
wiring of the house what whatever kind

2093.099 --> 2097.06
of electric field that creates they

2094.119 --> 2098.98
don't care like finally so the whole

2097.06 --> 2101.4
thing is built in a way to like uh

2098.98 --> 2105.22
oppress your

2101.4 --> 2108.1600000000003
so so it's an operation machine the

2105.22 --> 2110.3199999999997
structure rather than being a helpful

2108.16 --> 2111.94
that thing so in earlier times if the

2110.32 --> 2114.339
structure was made it would be like a

2111.94 --> 2117.2200000000003
sort of a enhancer

2114.339 --> 2119.859
to your energy field rather than a

2117.22 --> 2123.4599999999996
like a negative effect

2119.859 --> 2125.14
to do your field so so all of that I

2123.46 --> 2127.54
mean requires knowledge and nothing and

2125.14 --> 2129.7
I mean even that has not been done and

2127.54 --> 2133.0
people have not even thought about that

2129.7 --> 2135.3999999999996
what should I be in like if I'm going to

2133.0 --> 2137.5
be inside something like what uh what

2135.4 --> 2139.54
its purpose should be because purpose of

2137.5 --> 2142.54
any structure is only to enhance your

2139.54 --> 2144.7599999999998
electromagnetic field that's its purpose

2142.54 --> 2148.3
you know what we do a lot here very

2144.76 --> 2150.88
easily we accept we accept we don't

2148.3 --> 2152.98
accept ourselves again again we accept

2150.88 --> 2155.6800000000003
things on the outside very easily

2152.98 --> 2157.839
without questioning but when it comes to

2155.68 --> 2160.72
self-acceptance accept yourself I accept

2157.839 --> 2162.359
your Divine responsibility and your duty

2160.72 --> 2166.0
here oh no come on

2162.359 --> 2168.04
football or key and popcorn chicken

2166.0 --> 2170.92
wings more much more important come on

2168.04 --> 2172.599
so yeah I mean but all of that is a

2170.92 --> 2174.339
distraction you know because that it

2172.599 --> 2175.839
keeps you away from your realizing that

2174.339 --> 2178.359
you're a being you know it's a

2175.839 --> 2180.7
distraction to like so that you never

2178.359 --> 2182.38
confront the fact that you're a being

2180.7 --> 2183.8799999999997
which we saw talked about before many

2182.38 --> 2186.1600000000003
times the being thing I've said it many

2183.88 --> 2187.3
times you know that is so like so that

2186.16 --> 2188.68
you don't come to know that you're being

2187.3 --> 2190.96
and then there will be something that

2188.68 --> 2193.24
you have a future

2190.96 --> 2195.579
I mean it's not that you like you don't

2193.24 --> 2197.0789999999997
just have a present like in which you

2195.579 --> 2198.76
can do this action or that action or

2197.079 --> 2199.8390000000004
that action but you have a future as

2198.76 --> 2202.599
well

2199.839 --> 2206.0789999999997
you're not you just don't have a present

2202.599 --> 2208.599
leg so so like it it is taking the focus

2206.079 --> 2209.5600000000004
off from that kind of thing so it's a

2208.599 --> 2212.7400000000002
distraction

2209.56 --> 2214.48
and people have to figure out that it is

2212.74 --> 2216.7
a distraction and it takes away

2214.48 --> 2219.82
self-responsibility

2216.7 --> 2221.2
completely so so that so that is uh but

2219.82 --> 2223.3590000000004
that's up to you like you will have to

2221.2 --> 2225.7
take responsibility at some point when

2223.359 --> 2228.64
things get worse it depends on how bad

2225.7 --> 2230.68
things have to get before you will start

2228.64 --> 2233.2599999999998
taking responsibility you know I mean

2230.68 --> 2235.5989999999997
even when people get sick and stuff a

2233.26 --> 2237.1600000000003
lot of people in the that normal and

2235.599 --> 2238.3590000000004
then when they get very sick then they

2237.16 --> 2240.0989999999997
start taking responsibility then they

2238.359 --> 2241.24
say yeah I'm ready to do that I'm not

2240.099 --> 2242.8590000000004
gonna if the doctor says don't eat

2241.24 --> 2244.4799999999996
chicken wings they won't eat it like

2242.859 --> 2245.859
they'll do whatever

2244.48 --> 2249.119
then

2245.859 --> 2249.119
you know yeah

2251.14 --> 2255.7
yeah no I was gonna say even when they

2253.96 --> 2258.2200000000003
get sick they don't take responsibility

2255.7 --> 2260.02
because they give it to someone else to

2258.22 --> 2262.54
find the cure for them to find their

2260.02 --> 2265.24
solution to find instead of even making

2262.54 --> 2267.04
some little step little action for

2265.24 --> 2268.72
themselves like correct they're eating a

2267.04 --> 2271.72
bit while that start bringing a lot of

2268.72 --> 2274.1189999999997
greens lots of plants Lots you know the

2271.72 --> 2275.74
weekend yeah I mean but if you if you go

2274.119 --> 2277.2400000000002
to like learn a lot of times a lot of

2275.74 --> 2278.9199999999996
disease people get no they can't have

2277.24 --> 2280.66
this you know they can't have that you

2278.92 --> 2282.88
know there are restrictions which are

2280.66 --> 2284.3199999999997
put on them immediately once they get

2282.88 --> 2286.0
that so then they are ready to do it

2284.32 --> 2288.06
then just because the doctor said so now

2286.0 --> 2291.22
you know like

2288.06 --> 2292.72
I I mean I I can't have that now I can't

2291.22 --> 2295.54
have this or whatever like you know like

2292.72 --> 2298.839
so people do that only a once it reaches

2295.54 --> 2300.339
that level or state like or situation

2298.839 --> 2302.859
not before that

2300.339 --> 2305.2599999999998
now if we talk about this is we the next

2302.859 --> 2308.02
one here is hospital that I have in

2305.26 --> 2312.0400000000004
front of me in the hospital honestly

2308.02 --> 2314.859
okay if you have a major trauma like I

2312.04 --> 2316.839
broke my leg I dislocated The Petal

2314.859 --> 2320.38
everything I had the big balloon

2316.839 --> 2322.54
football ball of blood in my knee so I

2320.38 --> 2323.5
had to go somewhere so I went to the

2322.54 --> 2325.96
hospital

2323.5 --> 2328.06
but yeah I agree that when you enter

2325.96 --> 2330.2200000000003
there most of the time they do

2328.06 --> 2332.7999999999997
experiment on you I think

2330.22 --> 2335.7999999999997
yeah yeah I don't like it it looks like

2332.8 --> 2337.6600000000003
an experiment uh just the look of it

2335.8 --> 2340.48
just when you enter it and I don't know

2337.66 --> 2343.72
it's it's so weird you know why there's

2340.48 --> 2346.839
a reason why children do not like us but

2343.72 --> 2348.7599999999998
oh yeah there is a reason why I know

2346.839 --> 2351.46
today I mean it's a scary place like

2348.76 --> 2353.26
this is simply yes it's a scary place

2351.46 --> 2354.06
like it's a very simple thing like it's

2353.26 --> 2357.1600000000003
not

2354.06 --> 2360.04
hard to like oh yeah it's just getting

2357.16 --> 2362.3799999999997
yeah yeah I mean it's a I mean they have

2360.04 --> 2365.98
got a knives sharp instruments sharp

2362.38 --> 2367.359
things syringes yeah all these things I

2365.98 --> 2370.359
mean uh they have all the instruments of

2367.359 --> 2373.7799999999997
torture there which you can torture like

2370.359 --> 2376.5989999999997
uh you know like a what they call them

2373.78 --> 2380.26
uh like a prisoners of War

2376.599 --> 2382.54
pow blu's what you what you can

2380.26 --> 2384.76
torture prisoners a war with like you

2382.54 --> 2385.7799999999997
know so yeah yeah they have it all out

2384.76 --> 2387.82
there too

2385.78 --> 2390.2200000000003
and they have this cool lighting that

2387.82 --> 2394.06
white light like tube light and they

2390.22 --> 2395.7
have that uh yeah which is used the

2394.06 --> 2399.099
colors

2395.7 --> 2401.0789999999997
what is used to like uh you know torture

2399.099 --> 2403.54
like prisoners of War again you know

2401.079 --> 2406.96
tube like blinking and that white light

2403.54 --> 2409.96
you know to like after they put like

2406.96 --> 2411.78
four people in a room like putting a lot

2409.96 --> 2413.859
of people in the same room

2411.78 --> 2415.1800000000003
and then in other words they put all

2413.859 --> 2416.3199999999997
these needles into you and you're

2415.18 --> 2418.96
connected to all these hundred things

2416.32 --> 2421.119
and it you you seem like you know like

2418.96 --> 2423.339
you know you are in a bad thing you know

2421.119 --> 2426.359
it I mean it looks very hellish just

2423.339 --> 2429.7
even yeah like I mean exactly yeah yes

2426.359 --> 2432.64
so next is Material Science but I think

2429.7 --> 2435.0989999999997
we have uh went a little bit uh touched

2432.64 --> 2437.3799999999997
the the topic of Material Science just

2435.099 --> 2439.06
before with the the buildings but I

2437.38 --> 2441.52
think we should be a little bit more

2439.06 --> 2444.22
aware of the material uh the science of

2441.52 --> 2447.099
material and here in Canada if you look

2444.22 --> 2448.8999999999996
everyone build their houses they fight

2447.099 --> 2452.38
they started the foundation most people

2448.9 --> 2454.78
it's concrete like you pour concrete in

2452.38 --> 2457.54
the earth imagine what you're doing

2454.78 --> 2461.079
there like concrete you have concrete

2457.54 --> 2463.119
walls sometimes the the wave that the

2461.079 --> 2466.92
signal the waves of your cell phone

2463.119 --> 2470.2000000000003
doesn't even go through a concrete

2466.92 --> 2473.7000000000003
when you have a concrete wall inside the

2470.2 --> 2478.68
Earth how much current you Black come on

2473.7 --> 2478.68
telluric waves of Earth will never your

2480.839 --> 2484.839
they'll not have any kind of effect on

2483.64 --> 2487.54
you and that thing and you will be like

2484.839 --> 2489.46
totally isolated from everything and so

2487.54 --> 2491.74
you'll be in a like a zero energy Zone

2489.46 --> 2495.82
cut off completely and just suffering

2491.74 --> 2497.56
basically so all I mean all of these

2495.82 --> 2499.0
things are designed specifically to make

2497.56 --> 2500.32
it suffer

2499.0 --> 2502.0
so people have to understand everything

2500.32 --> 2505.48
out here is designed to make you suffer

2502.0 --> 2506.98
it's your choice to get off it and end

2505.48 --> 2509.7400000000002
your suffering

2506.98 --> 2511.56
only you your own action can end your

2509.74 --> 2515.2
suffering you know it's I mean otherwise

2511.56 --> 2517.48
uh this is a like a that thing where

2515.2 --> 2518.68
people are trying to torture people I

2517.48 --> 2520.48
mean this is the whole thing is to

2518.68 --> 2521.68
torture you whether it's your food

2520.48 --> 2523.9
whether it's your building whether it's

2521.68 --> 2526.5989999999997
your hospital whether it's anything

2523.9 --> 2529.0
is out there to torture you now you have

2526.599 --> 2530.619
to realize this and then after that take

2529.0 --> 2532.359
responsibility and

2530.619 --> 2534.88
end your torture I mean nobody's going

2532.359 --> 2537.2799999999997
to edit for you except yourself there is

2534.88 --> 2539.44
no other person and if you are fine with

2537.28 --> 2541.7200000000003
torture then you carry on and then you

2539.44 --> 2543.0
see wait wait that takes you to what

2541.72 --> 2544.5989999999997
level

2543.0 --> 2548.38
so

2544.599 --> 2550.42
yeah yeah five-star hotels that's a big

2548.38 --> 2553.6600000000003
thing and people have the idea that

2550.42 --> 2556.9
these things are uh like especially my

2553.66 --> 2558.7799999999997
children I brought them maybe twice or

2556.9 --> 2561.76
three times in hotels and the the

2558.78 --> 2563.8
children like hotels I don't know why

2561.76 --> 2565.42
but they don't like us but those but you

2563.8 --> 2567.82
bring them into a tales and they freak

2565.42 --> 2570.099
out like they run all over the pool and

2567.82 --> 2572.8590000000004
all that stuff but it's very unfractal

2570.099 --> 2575.8
it's very very uh like the lights again

2572.859 --> 2579.06
they're putting you like I always felt

2575.8 --> 2581.26
uh coming up into a hotel like it's the

2579.06 --> 2583.72
psychological uh thing for that is

2581.26 --> 2585.3390000000004
actually uh because in a hotel you can

2583.72 --> 2587.9199999999996
do anything and you can trash it up you

2585.339 --> 2589.9
can't trash up your home ah okay that's

2587.92 --> 2592.96
the idea that's why children walk in it

2589.9 --> 2595.0
and are all excited tell me what did You

2592.96 --> 2596.02
observe yeah yeah that's a psychological

2595.0 --> 2598.3
thing you know like because you can

2596.02 --> 2599.859
trash that up and you in your home you

2598.3 --> 2601.7200000000003
can't pass it up you know you you have

2599.859 --> 2604.24
to keep it that thing and you it's your

2601.72 --> 2605.68
responsibility to keep it but hotel is

2604.24 --> 2608.74
not yours responsibility it's someone

2605.68 --> 2611.9199999999996
else's responsibility so

2608.74 --> 2614.2599999999998
so it's pure Madness the children are

2611.92 --> 2615.579
programmed for distraction and right

2614.26 --> 2617.2000000000003
when they enter in there that's it

2615.579 --> 2620.26
that's how you enter a house the house

2617.2 --> 2624.46
of could be yours but it's not yours so

2620.26 --> 2626.8
you can trash it but even yours yes

2624.46 --> 2628.42
I think that's why a lot of the hotels

2626.8 --> 2630.579
are filled on New Years and stuff like

2628.42 --> 2632.5
people who have even houses they take up

2630.579 --> 2633.94
rooms in the new years and all of this

2632.5 --> 2636.16
airtime and stuff so that they can trash

2633.94 --> 2637.9
it up so they don't have to clean up the

2636.16 --> 2640.1189999999997
next day or you know to make up their

2637.9 --> 2643.2400000000002
bed I think just even these kind of

2640.119 --> 2646.0
things uh so that thing for people that

2643.24 --> 2647.4399999999996
that's why they prefer hotel that's why

2646.0 --> 2649.18
all the hotels get filled up like even

2647.44 --> 2651.4
by local populations it's not like

2649.18 --> 2653.2599999999998
there's some tourists coming or I mean

2651.4 --> 2655.2400000000002
in America and stuff a lot of hotels get

2653.26 --> 2656.8590000000004
filled up by these people like local

2655.24 --> 2658.54
people itself

2656.859 --> 2660.52
because and it's a funny thing why would

2658.54 --> 2664.42
you go to hotel if you ever have a house

2660.52 --> 2667.9
but but people do it because that's like

2664.42 --> 2670.119
you know yeah so some people cannot go

2667.9 --> 2672.819
without hotels but some others like

2670.119 --> 2675.2200000000003
nature more than hotels and um that kind

2672.819 --> 2677.859
of guy prefer go camping and they go

2675.22 --> 2679.56
into a hotel and prefer being nature

2677.859 --> 2682.2999999999997
then but yeah

2679.56 --> 2684.04
I mean yeah yeah I mean yeah I mean but

2682.3 --> 2685.8390000000004
the psychological level it is it is

2684.04 --> 2687.339
because of that because you can trash it

2685.839 --> 2691.9
up and that's the

2687.339 --> 2694.18
yeah exactly a whole lot of rubbish and

2691.9 --> 2697.2400000000002
you say here no matter where you go on

2694.18 --> 2698.7999999999997
this planet you will encounter rubbish

2697.24 --> 2701.74
yes

2698.8 --> 2702.6400000000003
yeah yeah and they extend a bit on your

2701.74 --> 2704.68
thinking

2702.64 --> 2706.18
yeah yeah I mean yeah I mean the thing

2704.68 --> 2708.04
is again another thing I wanted to say

2706.18 --> 2709.66
about the faisa hotels was that

2708.04 --> 2710.92
like the water considered five-star

2709.66 --> 2714.04
hotels right now don't even have a

2710.92 --> 2715.48
window like they're all boxed in so you

2714.04 --> 2718.0
have to rely on the AC

2715.48 --> 2720.579
you know you can't open a window or you

2718.0 --> 2722.44
can't have that thing so I mean they are

2720.579 --> 2725.8590000000004
making them like a prison cell boxes

2722.44 --> 2727.359
like you know it's uh so it's it's much

2725.859 --> 2729.52
worse than anything if you don't if you

2727.359 --> 2731.74
can't even open a window I mean what is

2729.52 --> 2734.44
the point like you know like it's what

2731.74 --> 2736.359
kind of structure is that for living for

2734.44 --> 2737.98
a human being like so but that's okay

2736.359 --> 2740.0789999999997
you don't need a window you have a couch

2737.98 --> 2741.099
and a fridge with beer don't need a

2740.079 --> 2743.1600000000003
window yeah

2741.099 --> 2745.599
yes

2743.16 --> 2747.7599999999998
that's what most people would say I'm

2745.599 --> 2750.0
fine I have my beer my fridge my couch

2747.76 --> 2752.5
my bed like it this is

2750.0 --> 2754.839
just to make you pass out it just needs

2752.5 --> 2756.66
to make you like uh forget that you even

2754.839 --> 2759.7
exist

2756.66 --> 2762.04
the next one is one that I really really

2759.7 --> 2764.2
liked and I was like the first time I

2762.04 --> 2767.56
saw it in your book I read I read it I'm

2764.2 --> 2771.339
like wow this is so true the wash Mania

2767.56 --> 2775.06
and here in Canada and U.S the it is Big

2771.339 --> 2778.42
because the water runs from the tap whoa

2775.06 --> 2781.2999999999997
it's free so come on let's work my

2778.42 --> 2783.339
people so we wash our car we wash our

2781.3 --> 2785.619
house we wash our clothes we wash

2783.339 --> 2788.7999999999997
everything the pool we wash everything

2785.619 --> 2791.92
that has to be super super clean but the

2788.8 --> 2794.5
inside forget about it there's too much

2791.92 --> 2796.1800000000003
too much time to wash for the wash Mania

2794.5 --> 2798.52
so forget about the inside but that's

2796.18 --> 2800.74
what's happening I've realized it when I

2798.52 --> 2802.96
read it and I was that kind of guy that

2800.74 --> 2806.2599999999998
used to that's my car but that summer

2802.96 --> 2808.2400000000002
haven't I haven't even washed it once I

2806.26 --> 2809.26
left the rain wash it it makes more

2808.24 --> 2810.9399999999996
sense

2809.26 --> 2813.8190000000004
yeah I mean there's no need to I mean

2810.94 --> 2815.319
it's it's metal elements I mean if you

2813.819 --> 2817.06
put water on and you'll only rust more

2815.319 --> 2820.24
like I mean

2817.06 --> 2823.72
I mean it's so crazy and they're just

2820.24 --> 2826.24
for it the Sparkle and again what's the

2823.72 --> 2828.5789999999997
real end goal of this like why do you do

2826.24 --> 2831.24
it yeah I mean I mean it's just because

2828.579 --> 2834.46
you you are not busy with yourself

2831.24 --> 2836.319
with your raising yourself

2834.46 --> 2839.26
taking care of your posture your body

2836.319 --> 2841.18
your mind your spirit you're not busy

2839.26 --> 2842.6800000000003
with that so either you could be busy

2841.18 --> 2844.72
with that or you could be busy with that

2842.68 --> 2847.8999999999996
you have only limited time

2844.72 --> 2849.8799999999997
I mean it can be one or the other so

2847.9 --> 2851.98
like once you're not then you're free to

2849.88 --> 2854.859
do all this other watching because you

2851.98 --> 2857.5
have no care for your own self

2854.859 --> 2859.48
and what what has happened to you so

2857.5 --> 2861.94
like all the Care is going to your car

2859.48 --> 2864.28
or your clothes and stuff and clothes

2861.94 --> 2866.5
and stuff also why like so that uh

2864.28 --> 2868.0600000000004
people it's creating an image if your

2866.5 --> 2869.44
car is sparkling or your clones are

2868.06 --> 2871.42
certain way then people will think some

2869.44 --> 2873.4
certain thing of you so it's again to

2871.42 --> 2876.52
Greater reaction from others and getting

2873.4 --> 2878.8
their approval and you know like that

2876.52 --> 2880.9
kind of thing so yeah I mean no matter

2878.8 --> 2883.119
what you're going to be busy but it's

2880.9 --> 2885.46
like are you watching football or

2883.119 --> 2887.46
elevating your vibration like

2885.46 --> 2891.099
yeah at one point yeah

2887.46 --> 2893.02
that's it I mean they can watch it

2891.099 --> 2894.52
yeah once once they wash the clothes and

2893.02 --> 2896.8
stuff like you know like because all of

2894.52 --> 2899.619
that is all again to get a status in

2896.8 --> 2902.319
society and and getting a people to

2899.619 --> 2904.6600000000003
think that you are like you know they

2902.319 --> 2907.06
they should not look down on you like if

2904.66 --> 2908.859
people have like more dirty clothes or

2907.06 --> 2911.74
more dirty car then people say oh look

2908.859 --> 2913.48
that thing is that thing so you know

2911.74 --> 2917.319
people don't want that people don't want

2913.48 --> 2920.98
others to think less of them so so that

2917.319 --> 2922.96
is another yeah and also PT when it

2920.98 --> 2925.54
comes to the clothes and when we wash

2922.96 --> 2928.18
our clothes very often we use very toxic

2925.54 --> 2930.94
detergent you know that's that's the

2928.18 --> 2933.7
next thing then you get rash and itch

2930.94 --> 2937.06
and so are you really watching it like

2933.7 --> 2939.04
if it makes you a uncomfortable and uh

2937.06 --> 2940.48
and obviously the whole thing is to

2939.04 --> 2942.88
torture you like I told you before

2940.48 --> 2944.5
everything out there is to torture you

2942.88 --> 2946.3
like even the detergent they give you or

2944.5 --> 2947.68
whatever is to torture you or your

2946.3 --> 2951.579
through your clothes through your body

2947.68 --> 2955.06
finally it's a war on your body so like

2951.579 --> 2957.94
the whole world is against that so it's

2955.06 --> 2960.7599999999998
up to you to stand up and fight back off

2957.94 --> 2962.98
you know because it's a war basically

2960.76 --> 2966.099
so yeah I think I feel sometimes that

2962.98 --> 2968.44
the war is like between unconscious

2966.099 --> 2970.78
being unconscious being like this is

2968.44 --> 2973.48
where or a bit the war is happening

2970.78 --> 2975.3390000000004
yeah I mean I mean the thing is that uh

2973.48 --> 2979.0
my beings are not take responsibility

2975.339 --> 2981.099
for themselves okay then uh they'll be

2979.0 --> 2985.18
given anything Jim saying and they'll be

2981.099 --> 2988.42
kept in a like a state of like labor

2985.18 --> 2990.46
and like of a labor camp of sorts and

2988.42 --> 2993.04
they will be given everything to make

2990.46 --> 2995.26
sure that their body mind doesn't get to

2993.04 --> 2997.06
a proper state where they can think for

2995.26 --> 2998.92
themselves figure things out and

2997.06 --> 3000.9
actually get out of that you know but

2998.92 --> 3003.839
that remains uh being's responsibility

3000.9 --> 3006.54
to do that you know because finally you

3003.839 --> 3009.18
are the one who's facing the music not

3006.54 --> 3012.06
the one who's giving the like the

3009.18 --> 3015.2999999999997
detention to you you know like you know

3012.06 --> 3016.5
so so it it is uh you who's using it and

3015.3 --> 3018.6600000000003
actually

3016.5 --> 3021.5
uh facing the music by that link so it's

3018.66 --> 3024.3799999999997
up to you to pull the plug

3021.5 --> 3026.76
pull the plug yeah yeah

3024.38 --> 3029.099
exactly what it is I've been saying that

3026.76 --> 3032.78
it was I think two three years ago I

3029.099 --> 3032.78
said pull the Babylonian plug

3034.579 --> 3040.619
next is culture and Agri culture and

3038.579 --> 3042.9
this is very interesting because I never

3040.619 --> 3045.2400000000002
really looked at the word agriculture

3042.9 --> 3047.7000000000003
this way but I don't think that's really

3045.24 --> 3050.64
what we can call like agriculture today

3047.7 --> 3053.819
it's more like destruction culture or

3050.64 --> 3056.4
destruction I agree destruction agree

3053.819 --> 3060.5589999999997
distraction maybe should be the word but

3056.4 --> 3062.76
we are like just say you look at it

3060.559 --> 3064.1400000000003
they don't I know how to do any culture

3062.76 --> 3066.0
the way the agriculture is done in the

3064.14 --> 3067.92
way that's not like that just us spoils

3066.0 --> 3069.96
the land completely and it's unusable in

3067.92 --> 3072.54
5-10 years in 15 20 years like that's

3069.96 --> 3074.64
all you know it is just it is just

3072.54 --> 3076.92
destroying land it's nothing to do with

3074.64 --> 3079.6189999999997
agriculture at all or this is not like

3076.92 --> 3082.079
in any kind of a natural way cycle or

3079.619 --> 3085.8
following any principles of that at all

3082.079 --> 3087.3
so so so that is all uh like a chamber

3085.8 --> 3089.88
but again for that you have to basic

3087.3 --> 3091.8
culture of everything you know they you

3089.88 --> 3093.7200000000003
have to have some basics I mean you

3091.8 --> 3095.6400000000003
can't just have agriculture without

3093.72 --> 3096.54
culture as a whole like you know you

3095.64 --> 3098.7
can't

3096.54 --> 3101.16
do that I mean everything has to be

3098.7 --> 3102.96
understood like the body and the basics

3101.16 --> 3105.24
and everything and everything has to be

3102.96 --> 3107.4
in place for something and wherever

3105.24 --> 3109.0789999999997
agriculture was there in this world I

3107.4 --> 3111.1800000000003
mean they could have learned from it but

3109.079 --> 3112.92
they didn't learn instead of learning

3111.18 --> 3114.96
they actually just went with their own

3112.92 --> 3117.48
things and you know which was just

3114.96 --> 3119.339
egotistical thinking no no I'll know how

3117.48 --> 3120.599
to do it better or I'll do it in a way

3119.339 --> 3123.7799999999997
where I don't have to do anything much

3120.599 --> 3125.7000000000003
include for me or I'll grow much more

3123.78 --> 3128.28
out of the same piece of land that you

3125.7 --> 3130.74
are growing I mean when there is no need

3128.28 --> 3133.079
for any of that in the first place so

3130.74 --> 3134.3999999999996
there was never any need of like growing

3133.079 --> 3135.599
so much and now they're growing so much

3134.4 --> 3137.88
and they have to destroy it like they

3135.599 --> 3140.94
have to burn it a lot of it and

3137.88 --> 3144.96
because because it's it's of no use to

3140.94 --> 3146.46
anyone so so so it's like I mean it's

3144.96 --> 3148.5
just like the shared Madness the whole

3146.46 --> 3150.059
thing is sheer Madness like there you go

3148.5 --> 3151.92
then this work I've shared Madness but

3150.059 --> 3154.38
that's it when you start using your time

3151.92 --> 3156.7200000000003
using your body you start caring about

3154.38 --> 3159.9
it a lot more that's what happened for

3156.72 --> 3163.2599999999998
me like I was 300 pound I went down to

3159.9 --> 3165.2400000000002
200 so uh you know some there's a you're

3163.26 --> 3167.46
gonna you have to operate when you start

3165.24 --> 3169.4399999999996
uh lighting up the light bulb and

3167.46 --> 3172.26
changing the socket in your head with a

3169.44 --> 3174.079
new light bulb you should that's what

3172.26 --> 3176.88
they explained to me apologize

3174.079 --> 3178.319
change the socket put the Thousand wet

3176.88 --> 3180.7200000000003
and you're gonna see everything clear

3178.319 --> 3183.0589999999997
just you don't have enough and that's

3180.72 --> 3184.74
what happened if you are uh not if

3183.059 --> 3187.44
you're light is not bright enough inside

3184.74 --> 3189.54
you you're in darkness you're in fog

3187.44 --> 3191.76
you're in you know it's very damaging to

3189.54 --> 3193.74
your uh to your being

3191.76 --> 3195.1800000000003
yeah and the starting point of all of

3193.74 --> 3197.64
this is just basically starting taking

3195.18 --> 3199.2
care of your own body just yeah just

3197.64 --> 3202.22
just a very simple thing I think we'll

3199.2 --> 3204.0589999999997
put a light on it a lot of things yes

3202.22 --> 3206.04
by itself

3204.059 --> 3208.38
yeah yeah yeah on a lot of things like

3206.04 --> 3210.0589999999997
you will come to know in your day-to-day

3208.38 --> 3211.5
life everything what you do where do you

3210.059 --> 3214.8
live with what you eat what you that

3211.5 --> 3217.5
thing what to take everything will put

3214.8 --> 3219.7200000000003
it will put everything into perspective

3217.5 --> 3222.72
yet he will become more uh maybe

3219.72 --> 3225.0589999999997
independent also because this is a myth

3222.72 --> 3227.8799999999997
of Independence and you see here that's

3225.059 --> 3230.52
a very very big buzzword Independence

3227.88 --> 3233.2200000000003
and uh yes if I look at the words it

3230.52 --> 3237.119
says in dependent so you should depend

3233.22 --> 3239.8799999999997
on you inside yeah not depending on

3237.119 --> 3241.2000000000003
something outside yeah but yeah but the

3239.88 --> 3243.48
thing is people are not independent

3241.2 --> 3246.66
people are when they're part of a like a

3243.48 --> 3248.52
social uh slave Matrix like that's what

3246.66 --> 3250.2599999999998
and they have no Independence I mean

3248.52 --> 3252.0
they just have to pay their bills and

3250.26 --> 3254.5200000000004
their mortgages and this and that and

3252.0 --> 3256.38
stuff like that and just do things which

3254.52 --> 3258.96
they don't want to do and all day long

3256.38 --> 3260.819
and then get some money into buy things

3258.96 --> 3262.559
which are not good for them and you know

3260.819 --> 3264.3
like I mean that's not independence of

3262.559 --> 3265.26
any kind like you know but it's a myth

3264.3 --> 3266.579
which has been created so that people

3265.26 --> 3269.3390000000004
won't Rebel

3266.579 --> 3271.98
okay like so that there's no actual

3269.339 --> 3274.14
Rebellion like that's all so just give

3271.98 --> 3277.44
them a like a notion false

3274.14 --> 3280.319
notion of that you're independent yeah I

3277.44 --> 3282.66
mean the false notion of Independence

3280.319 --> 3285.72
and I like what you say at the end you

3282.66 --> 3288.359
say Jedis are dependent on the force

3285.72 --> 3290.9399999999996
yeah yeah the force inside there is

3288.359 --> 3292.7999999999997
forces like okay you might not because I

3290.94 --> 3295.8
think you know what I think people have

3292.8 --> 3298.26
to see things physically or if not the

3295.8 --> 3300.0
the you know it's your ability to see

3298.26 --> 3303.1800000000003
the Unseen also that's very important

3300.0 --> 3304.98
and there's a lot more stuff that you

3303.18 --> 3307.14
won't see with your eyes that you're

3304.98 --> 3309.42
gonna sense in this life with your art

3307.14 --> 3312.1189999999997
than what you're gonna because often

3309.42 --> 3314.64
what we see is what we see but what we

3312.119 --> 3316.859
can sense is much bigger and the force

3314.64 --> 3318.48
the forces the Divine forces and the

3316.859 --> 3320.7599999999998
Divine whisper and the divine

3318.48 --> 3323.099
inspiration and the Divine will and the

3320.76 --> 3326.0400000000004
Divine this Divine you can bring it on

3323.099 --> 3328.44
and again Divine the word divine it has

3326.04 --> 3330.359
to do also with with the Vine with the

3328.44 --> 3332.04
grapes like I was listening to someone

3330.359 --> 3334.14
yesterday and he was talking about that

3332.04 --> 3336.599
that the grapes often return the gray

3334.14 --> 3338.8799999999997
into wine and the wine is the repression

3336.599 --> 3342.7200000000003
representation of the blood for many

3338.88 --> 3345.839
people so the Divine will and also uh

3342.72 --> 3349.52
the the water from the sky falls on the

3345.839 --> 3351.859
ground and brings certain things

3349.52 --> 3354.9
wine means branching

3351.859 --> 3357.0589999999997
wine is a v okay V is what this you ever

3354.9 --> 3358.5
be like okay so whenever you have a tree

3357.059 --> 3360.5400000000004
like you have a branch then you have

3358.5 --> 3361.8
another Branch like this then you have

3360.54 --> 3363.0589999999997
another Branch like that so that's our

3361.8 --> 3366.059
tree is made right

3363.059 --> 3372.78
from the stem comes branches then more

3366.059 --> 3375.6600000000003
more is bees it's vs okay okay now uh

3372.78 --> 3377.46
Divine means fractal branching not just

3375.66 --> 3379.74
branching

3377.46 --> 3380.579
practical branching okay

3379.74 --> 3382.9799999999996
okay

3380.579 --> 3385.92
extend a little bit because I use the

3382.98 --> 3387.72
word often Branch out I say often we

3385.92 --> 3389.819
have to Branch out yeah but yeah

3387.72 --> 3392.04
branching is like a tree like a tree is

3389.819 --> 3393.54
that thing okay no but the branching

3392.04 --> 3395.64
whether it will happen in a fire Ratio

3393.54 --> 3397.68
or what numbers like you know the

3395.64 --> 3400.2
Fibonacci series like on which the

3397.68 --> 3401.8799999999997
nature is so like a nature tree when it

3400.2 --> 3405.4199999999996
branches it follows a certain natural

3401.88 --> 3409.5
laws in that branching okay which is

3405.42 --> 3411.2400000000002
tending towards like gold ratio okay now

3409.5 --> 3413.94
gold ratio will be perfect branching

3411.24 --> 3416.22
okay if it is perfect golden ratio okay

3413.94 --> 3418.859
which will be divine

3416.22 --> 3422.04
so so wine just means branching actually

3418.859 --> 3425.94
So Divine means diverse branching in the

3422.04 --> 3428.96
golden ratio okay so so yeah because you

3425.94 --> 3431.2200000000003
can call it five iron also buy mine like

3428.96 --> 3433.92
you can call it instead of divine five

3431.22 --> 3436.2
iron p h i b i n e it'll make the

3433.92 --> 3439.98
meaning more clear okay what it actually

3436.2 --> 3442.7999999999997
is okay so so that so that is I mean

3439.98 --> 3445.68
it's a scientific concept which people

3442.8 --> 3447.2400000000002
have to understand where it is uh real

3445.68 --> 3449.2799999999997
science not the fake science they teach

3447.24 --> 3451.3799999999997
in school but uh you know like but

3449.28 --> 3452.94
there's a it's the actual real sign that

3451.38 --> 3456.96
branching can happen in five ratio and

3452.94 --> 3458.579
that is what divine is so like a like a

3456.96 --> 3459.66
you know like on my website there is

3458.579 --> 3462.6600000000003
this cup

3459.66 --> 3464.7599999999998
in the ratio and you can keep on staying

3462.66 --> 3466.74
staying inside that cup and the cup will

3464.76 --> 3468.3
keep on appearing the same same same no

3466.74 --> 3470.3999999999996
matter how much you zoom in how much you

3468.3 --> 3472.8
zoom out you'll see the same thing okay

3470.4 --> 3474.6600000000003
that is divine okay that is

3472.8 --> 3477.3590000000004
actually the

3474.66 --> 3478.3799999999997
physical graphical representation of

3477.359 --> 3482.339
divine

3478.38 --> 3484.38
in a 2d format of your screen okay which

3482.339 --> 3487.92
is a 3D structure with a 2d

3484.38 --> 3489.78
representation okay but there is now

3487.92 --> 3492.42
like we are in times where we can

3489.78 --> 3494.6400000000003
actually have those representations okay

3492.42 --> 3496.38
so we don't have to like think about or

3494.64 --> 3497.46
believing in Divine do we have to

3496.38 --> 3500.28
believe in Divine or not believe in

3497.46 --> 3502.02
Divine I mean it is a actual

3500.28 --> 3504.9
real thing you can see with your own

3502.02 --> 3506.7599999999998
eyes like yeah yeah so we are not living

3504.9 --> 3509.099
in those times where you know you have

3506.76 --> 3513.0
to it's some strange

3509.099 --> 3514.8590000000004
something something like which is not

3513.0 --> 3517.14
understood I mean and nature is always

3514.859 --> 3519.5989999999997
tending towards it and but it is not

3517.14 --> 3521.5789999999997
getting there fully so the actual

3519.599 --> 3525.0
perfect branching

3521.579 --> 3526.6800000000003
wine will be divine like okay so if you

3525.0 --> 3528.9
talk about the Golden Rule we're just

3526.68 --> 3532.14
gonna finish with this uh you talk about

3528.9 --> 3535.079
Golden reissue Fibonacci all this and

3532.14 --> 3537.839
there's the the feed the pi Phi I think

3535.079 --> 3541.799
it's called Phi there's something yeah

3537.839 --> 3543.66
yeah okay but you have the pH the pH of

3541.799 --> 3546.42
the body and you have the eye so what's

3543.66 --> 3549.42
the relation with Je

3546.42 --> 3549.42
anyways

3553.7 --> 3559.5
nothing what's the relation between all

3556.98 --> 3562.26
this like I mean I mean the point is the

3559.5 --> 3564.9
relation is this like okay like uh what

3562.26 --> 3567.599
they considered be it like balance pH

3564.9 --> 3569.099
you know like that thing is just a

3567.599 --> 3572.94
medium

3569.099 --> 3577.26
for the electrical electromagnetic waves

3572.94 --> 3579.42
to form certain kind of Loops okay okay

3577.26 --> 3581.28
that's all there is and those Loops

3579.42 --> 3584.28
finally when they go closer to gold

3581.28 --> 3585.48
ratio will have maximum constructive

3584.28 --> 3587.579
interference

3585.48 --> 3590.4
where they'll pile upon each other

3587.579 --> 3592.02
and go up more which you will call like

3590.4 --> 3595.02
inside your body Bliss

3592.02 --> 3597.54
or higher wave harmonics or anything

3595.02 --> 3599.22
like so all those things are connected

3597.54 --> 3602.22
that way you know you have to provide

3599.22 --> 3607.319
the medium for that within your body

3602.22 --> 3611.72
so and that is a Phi Phi is a letter

3607.319 --> 3614.04
also in the Greek alphabet yeah yeah

3611.72 --> 3616.5589999999997
that's why the word fine comes from the

3614.04 --> 3620.099
fine word comes from that only yeah so

3616.559 --> 3622.799
like it's not F any like it's not fi

3620.099 --> 3626.4
when people put fi then they forget what

3622.799 --> 3627.839
it is so five fine will mean in Phi in

3626.4 --> 3629.52
Phi so in five means you're in Golden

3627.839 --> 3633.299
Ratio then you are fine like then you're

3629.52 --> 3636.0
doing fine your pH is right your uh

3633.299 --> 3637.799
heart is at a golden wave harmonic and

3636.0 --> 3640.559
all of that is happening then you are

3637.799 --> 3643.2
fine otherwise you are not fine like I

3640.559 --> 3645.48
mean there is a but his mind actually

3643.2 --> 3649.02
means an actual State it's not some

3645.48 --> 3651.18
theoretical concept of being fine it's

3649.02 --> 3653.4
not that theoretical counts ever like

3651.18 --> 3655.5589999999997
this it's actually a right thing the

3653.4 --> 3658.52
right thing to do to bring your yeah no

3655.559 --> 3662.52
thank you very much uh

3658.52 --> 3664.559
very very uh enriching session today I

3662.52 --> 3666.599
was I'm very delighted I've learned a

3664.559 --> 3669.059
lot again for sure that's the goal of

3666.599 --> 3672.78
getting together and spreading awareness

3669.059 --> 3674.76
and love and more Good Vibes so thank

3672.78 --> 3677.8190000000004
you very much and thanks everyone also

3674.76 --> 3680.28
for uh being here and giving attention

3677.819 --> 3683.7
it's about giving attention not getting

3680.28 --> 3686.4
attention I hope we all get that very

3683.7 --> 3689.16
clearly today I think that's what came

3686.4 --> 3691.319
out the most is we're not here to get

3689.16 --> 3693.24
attention but to give attention to iron

3691.319 --> 3695.52
Divine and if we give attention to iron

3693.24 --> 3698.0589999999997
Divine we automatically give attention

3695.52 --> 3698.059
to each other

3699.74 --> 3707.04
and simple facts and simple action and

3703.559 --> 3709.6800000000003
