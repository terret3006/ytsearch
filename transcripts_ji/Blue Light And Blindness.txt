8.75 --> 14.120000000000001

11.309 --> 14.12
tonight and

14.259 --> 20.8
it's Friday and I'm glad it's Friday but

18.099 --> 23.11
I'm here to tell you folks that we've

20.8 --> 26.43
got some major major developments and

23.11 --> 29.169
this is a very very important broadcast

26.43 --> 32.769
and I want to go into something tonight

29.169 --> 34.93
that I've touched on before but we're

32.769 --> 36.37
gonna go into it and we're gonna go off

34.93 --> 40.0
in some directions with this that are

36.37 --> 41.62
very relevant now I just want you to

40.0 --> 44.11
know something folks and I want to read

41.62 --> 49.599999999999994
a scripture here it's out of the book of

44.11 --> 53.62
Hebrews and it's Hebrews 11 excuse me

49.6 --> 56.5
Hebrews 10 verse 38 and 39 it says the

53.62 --> 58.149
just shall live by faith but if any man

56.5 --> 62.26
draw back my soul shall have no pleasure

58.149 --> 65.35
in him but we are not of them who draw

62.26 --> 68.649
back unto perdition but of them that

65.35 --> 69.13
believe to the saving of the soul all

68.649 --> 73.09
right folks

69.13 --> 74.71
you know as Christians we are not into

73.09 --> 79.75
killing people and invent the evil

74.71 --> 85.33
things we are not into creating devices

79.75 --> 91.0
and schemes that draw people back into

85.33 --> 92.709
being lost we're all about saving the

91.0 --> 96.58
soul and that's done through Jesus

92.709 --> 98.89
Christ now the eyes are the window to

96.58 --> 100.84
the soul ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna

98.89 --> 103.66
put this away because I've read from it

100.84 --> 106.989
just enough open this up and father in

103.66 --> 109.0
Jesus name may this broadcast go far and

106.989 --> 110.259
wide and reach a lot of people because

109.0 --> 113.44
what we're going to talk about here

110.259 --> 116.05
tonight on my commute home is extremely

113.44 --> 117.91
important father in Jesus name open the

116.05 --> 121.959
eyes literally and protect the eyes

117.91 --> 123.31
literally and figuratively Lord because

121.959 --> 126.989
the eyes are the windows to the soul

123.31 --> 129.64000000000001
they're an amazing creation by you and

126.989 --> 132.0
may we understand that it's a

129.64 --> 135.819
responsibility to care for our eyes and

132.0 --> 137.47
to open the eyes as your son Jesus

135.819 --> 139.51
Christ open the eyes of the blind so

137.47 --> 141.43
shall we and so shall your word and your

139.51 --> 147.819
truth in Jesus

141.43 --> 151.42000000000002
amen all right let's get on with the

147.819 --> 154.659
show folks we got a situation on our

151.42 --> 156.939
hands that's very serious and it has to

154.659 --> 159.42999999999998
do with the lighting and I've talked

156.939 --> 161.65
about the lighting on several of my

159.43 --> 163.84
videos I've written extensively on the

161.65 --> 167.769
Fullerton and former calm about the

163.84 --> 169.92000000000002
lighting and we have now been given some

167.769 --> 175.389
information by some scientific

169.92 --> 180.54899999999998
publications that there has been

175.389 --> 185.23000000000002
evidence observed that blue light can

180.549 --> 190.87
make you go blind folks that's right you

185.23 --> 194.76899999999998
heard me now I want to talk about this

190.87 --> 197.31900000000002
they're saying that blue light as it

194.769 --> 201.459
hits a compound called retinol in your

197.319 --> 204.069
eyes when you have this compound that's

201.459 --> 205.93
in your photoreceptors in your eyes that

204.069 --> 209.13899999999998
is hit with a specific wavelength of

205.93 --> 212.169
light specifically blue light that it

209.139 --> 214.419
creates toxic compounds in your eye that

212.169 --> 216.19
kill the photoreceptor cells and these

214.419 --> 218.62
photoreceptor cells do not regenerate

216.19 --> 221.919
ladies and gentlemen now the reason I

218.62 --> 225.15
want to talk about this is because I've

221.919 --> 228.54000000000002
touched on it before but now we've got

225.15 --> 232.0
publications and the media talking about

228.54 --> 233.85899999999998
this being a problem now if you go to

232.0 --> 235.389
CNN today they're going to be talking to

233.859 --> 240.449
you about a whale that's carrying its

235.389 --> 240.449
dead baby around and some other nonsense

240.54 --> 247.349
well every single human being alive

243.9 --> 250.64000000000001
right now that has electricity has been

247.349 --> 255.17999999999998
spending time in front of a television

250.64 --> 257.37
my hella vision an idiot box or the

255.18 --> 260.459
devil's doorway or whatever you want to

257.37 --> 266.19
call it and in front of a screen and in

260.459 --> 268.229
front of a phone now every single one of

266.19 --> 272.21999999999997
these movies that's been coming out of

268.229 --> 274.38
Hollywood by these sickos is being

272.22 --> 279.68
produced within an ordinate amount of

274.38 --> 282.27
blue light ladies and gentlemen now

279.68 --> 285.6
they're now telling us the blue light

282.27 --> 289.71
can lead to blindness they're telling us

285.6 --> 292.199
that they just figured this out know the

289.71 --> 294.09
stuff that was released yesterday about

292.199 --> 298.11
this

294.09 --> 301.79999999999995
was work that was done by a PhD

298.11 --> 306.06
candidate student and the work was

301.8 --> 308.82
belied by the hypothesis of an assistant

306.06 --> 312.28000000000003
professor now ladies and gentlemen

308.82 --> 315.46999999999997
they have proliferated

312.28 --> 320.86999999999995
hundreds of millions of devices get emit

315.47 --> 323.23
blue light constantly and what they have

320.87 --> 323.23
done

323.24 --> 329.18
is they have withheld the information

326.38 --> 333.259
and now they've decided to release some

329.18 --> 335.509
of it through the conduit of a graduate

333.259 --> 337.819
student and an assistant professor folks

335.509 --> 340.72900000000004
the government has studied what blue

337.819 --> 342.58000000000004
light has done for years these people

340.729 --> 344.84
know what they're doing

342.58 --> 347.3
Hollywood has been perfecting how to

344.84 --> 348.88899999999995
maximize blue light emissions and all

347.3 --> 355.099
the movies have you noticed how blue

348.889 --> 358.34000000000003
everything is at night folks your eyes

355.099 --> 362.03
are the window to your soul ladies and

358.34 --> 365.289
gentlemen and they have got them and

362.03 --> 369.83
they are literally destroying your eyes

365.289 --> 372.65
ladies and gentlemen they are destroying

369.83 --> 375.05
the window to your soul now who is they

372.65 --> 379.03
well it's the people that the Bible

375.05 --> 380.63
refers to as inventors of evil things

379.03 --> 383.27
that's right

380.63 --> 384.56
there's a special punishment for those

383.27 --> 388.13
people who take pleasure in

384.56 --> 390.86
unrighteousness and inventors of evil

388.13 --> 393.139
things now what are these evil things

390.86 --> 397.039
I'm talking about well let's get started

393.139 --> 398.979
right now folks from the cradle to the

397.039 --> 405.139
casket

398.979 --> 408.979
we have been damned with screens in our

405.139 --> 410.81
face and some of it's by choice and some

408.979 --> 413.21
of it's through some really sick mind

410.81 --> 415.99
control programming in the apps and in

413.21 --> 417.919
the software in the flicker rate

415.99 --> 420.02
manipulation highly addictive

417.919 --> 421.08
programming and screens and apps and

420.02 --> 422.669
platforms

421.08 --> 424.289
they know that there's there are people

422.669 --> 425.58
out there in the psychiatric and

424.289 --> 426.81
psychological community that are trying

425.58 --> 429.419
to fight this but they're part of the

426.81 --> 431.639
problem too but here's the deal folks

429.419 --> 433.68
these people that are inventing these

431.639 --> 435.719
things they know exactly what they're

433.68 --> 438.389
doing I could tell you right now that I

435.719 --> 441.539
spent a lot of time filming things as a

438.389 --> 444.3
child taking pictures indoors outdoors

441.539 --> 447.0
pictures of roses apricots fish sunsets

444.3 --> 449.909
sunrises girlfriends you name it trees

447.0 --> 454.469
blossoms bees birds rocks mountains

449.909 --> 456.33
lakes boats sunsets car accidents you

454.469 --> 458.37
name it I've taken pictures of all these

456.33 --> 461.669
things I filmed things with video

458.37 --> 464.009
cameras how come when you turn on a TV

461.669 --> 466.83
everything is blue no matter what time

464.009 --> 469.259
it is whether it's day or night whether

466.83 --> 471.35999999999996
they're outside or inside a room a

469.259 --> 473.66900000000004
bedroom a control room but a mosque a

471.36 --> 478.319
mausoleum a morgue it's always blue

473.669 --> 483.13
light why is that because they know what

478.319 --> 485.64000000000004
blue light does folks blue light

483.13 --> 490.93
through the creation of photochemical

485.64 --> 494.90999999999997
processes creates

490.93 --> 498.66
reactive oxygen species which create

494.91 --> 501.1
toxic chemicals which destroy the

498.66 --> 502.96000000000004
photoreceptors in the eyes that God gave

501.1 --> 507.82000000000005
you this is extremely important folks

502.96 --> 509.5
blue light at night I've spoken about

507.82 --> 512.89
this in a video called the blue light of

509.5 --> 514.779
death how blue light at night disrupts

512.89 --> 516.909
circadian rhythm melatonin production

514.779 --> 520.18
sleep cycles healing and everything else

516.909 --> 523.36
and is responsible for these hormonal

520.18 --> 525.6099999999999
and adrenal cancers folks I've gone into

523.36 --> 529.0
detail look up the blue light of death

525.61 --> 531.49
on YouTube or you can look up the LED

529.0 --> 535.75
streetlight sterilization agenda on the

531.49 --> 538.3
Fullerton and former calm look ladies

535.75 --> 540.97
and gentlemen I have made it very clear

538.3 --> 544.17
what's being done to you and I come to

540.97 --> 548.83
you tonight to elaborate on more of this

544.17 --> 552.9699999999999
this is very important now I understand

548.83 --> 556.9590000000001
that it's Friday night but I understand

552.97 --> 558.76
a lot of people have made their plans to

556.959 --> 561.6099999999999
enjoy themselves after a long work week

558.76 --> 564.36
and I too will do the same because

561.61 --> 567.22
that's just life folks we have to live

564.36 --> 569.0500000000001
but this information once it's needed by

567.22 --> 571.76
you must be widely disseminated I want

569.05 --> 573.89
to talk to you about these people

571.76 --> 576.14
people that invent these evil things and

573.89 --> 577.88
I want to talk to you about a new video

576.14 --> 581.77
game that has got all the children

577.88 --> 585.07
addicted and it's called fortnight and

581.77 --> 588.02
the person that invented this video game

585.07 --> 589.7900000000001
go ahead and look him up on the internet

588.02 --> 591.5
I'm not gonna mention his name right now

589.79 --> 593.5699999999999
because I'm going to do a special video

591.5 --> 595.43
on him in the future but I want you to

593.57 --> 598.69
look at the person who invented for

595.43 --> 601.4899999999999
tonight and then I want you to look at

598.69 --> 604.0400000000001
the fortnight game and look at how blue

601.49 --> 606.98
it is how much blue light this thing

604.04 --> 609.62
emits and how it keeps children up all

606.98 --> 611.14
night long and staring at their phones

609.62 --> 613.25
all day and all night

611.14 --> 615.53
everywhere they go these kids are glued

613.25 --> 618.2
to this thing and the person that

615.53 --> 620.66
developed for tonight worked for the

618.2 --> 623.75
government and had to do with child

620.66 --> 626.9
welfare and child psychology so you know

623.75 --> 632.44
this invention of this evil thing is not

626.9 --> 634.91
an accident ladies and gentlemen now

632.44 --> 639.86
what we're being told about this blue

634.91 --> 642.17
light is that we're being warned that it

639.86 --> 642.9
comes from all sources including

642.17 --> 644.2299999999999
sunlight

642.9 --> 645.85
[Music]

644.23 --> 647.25
now I want to talk to you about that

645.85 --> 649.63
folks that's very important cuz the

647.25 --> 653.32
scientific community is telling us to

649.63 --> 657.01
wear sunglasses to protect our eyes from

653.32 --> 659.6500000000001
the blue light from the Sun now do any

657.01 --> 664.08
of you have diabetes or know anybody

659.65 --> 668.47
that has diabetes if you do or you do

664.08 --> 672.57
then you will know that refined sugar is

668.47 --> 675.49
a death sentence to a diabetic and that

672.57 --> 678.6700000000001
refined sugar in the form that it comes

675.49 --> 681.64
in from C&H or high fructose corn syrup

678.67 --> 684.01
or those refined versions of sugar are

681.64 --> 688.06
deadly to a diabetic they'll spike that

684.01 --> 690.37
blood sugar level immediately and we

688.06 --> 692.1999999999999
know that foods that are made with those

690.37 --> 695.2
processed refined sugars are deadly even

692.2 --> 699.25
to human beings that are healthy but the

695.2 --> 704.7
point of getting at is that sugars come

699.25 --> 709.03
in many forms glucose fructose galactose

704.7 --> 710.47
nanos I could go into different types of

709.03 --> 714.61
sugars there are many different

710.47 --> 719.14
variations of the c6h12o6

714.61 --> 722.95
sugar molecule and each one has a

719.14 --> 725.89
different metabolic path and a very

722.95 --> 730.36
interesting way that the body deals with

725.89 --> 732.25
it and the point is is if you take for

730.36 --> 734.38
example in orange you're gonna have a

732.25 --> 736.75
lot of fructose because that's the the

734.38 --> 738.55
sugar that's present in oranges now

736.75 --> 740.83
you're diabetic you shouldn't be

738.55 --> 746.29
drinking orange juice because it dumps

740.83 --> 748.3000000000001
too much of one kind of sugar now

746.29 --> 751.12
I hope my voice makes you jump out of

748.3 --> 755.4699999999999
your skin cuz you need to wake up this

751.12 --> 757.63
is very important folks now if you

755.47 --> 762.25
consume things that have a broad

757.63 --> 768.069
spectrum of sugars especially things

762.25 --> 774.569
like for example nopales cactus it

768.069 --> 778.0
contains a very broad spectrum of sugars

774.569 --> 781.74
and it is very healthy and beneficial to

778.0 --> 783.97
a diabetic to come consume nopales

781.74 --> 786.339
especially if you're Hispanic or

783.97 --> 788.259
American Indian and you have diabetes

786.339 --> 792.1300000000001
you should be eating the pilots every

788.259 --> 794.8000000000001
day wrong that is a food that contains a

792.13 --> 798.279
broad spectrum of sugars specifically

794.8 --> 800.4699999999999
mucopolysaccharides and there's nothing

798.279 --> 805.269
wrong with sugars if they're balanced

800.47 --> 808.1800000000001
out in a variety of shapes and forms as

805.269 --> 810.49
long as they're natural the same goes

808.18 --> 814.3599999999999
for light folks when you go outside

810.49 --> 817.48
during the day you have life-giving

814.36 --> 820.899
light properly balanced in the proper

817.48 --> 823.2090000000001
spectrum given to us by God for health

820.899 --> 826.209
and now the scientists are telling us to

823.209 --> 829.029
wear sunglasses to avoid one component

826.209 --> 830.6199999999999
of the daylight spectrum which is a very

829.029 --> 832.959
minimal component of the daylight

830.62 --> 834.55
spectrum it's mixed in with all the

832.959 --> 837.7689999999999
white and the orange and the yellow

834.55 --> 841.579
light the blue light the green light

837.769 --> 845.809
but they don't tell us the truth about

841.579 --> 851.029
what's going on when we take the blue

845.809 --> 854.7199999999999
light all by itself at night folks and

851.029 --> 860.199
that is blue light all by itself at

854.72 --> 863.3290000000001
night is like taking a bag of sugar and

860.199 --> 865.67
freebasing the five pounds of sugar if

863.329 --> 868.3689999999999
you have diabetes folks that's the

865.67 --> 870.559
comparison blue light at night

868.369 --> 874.009
compared to sunlight exposure during the

870.559 --> 876.259
day is like a diabetic eating a leaf of

874.009 --> 879.86
cactus compared to mainlining a free

876.259 --> 883.939
based bag of sugar they're lying to you

879.86 --> 885.799
they're using good information and

883.939 --> 887.54
giving you bad advice with it they're

885.799 --> 892.699
telling you to stay out of the Sun now

887.54 --> 895.459
folks once again another example of how

892.699 --> 897.3789999999999
they kill you with the truth because you

895.459 --> 901.67
don't understand how they're twisting it

897.379 --> 905.029
into lies the Sun is good for you the

901.67 --> 906.799
Sun offers a full spectrum of color

905.029 --> 907.819
temperatures of light that your body

906.799 --> 913.939
needs

907.819 --> 916.3689999999999
your body is a photoreceptive being the

913.939 --> 918.439
light frequencies trigger metabolic

916.369 --> 921.9490000000001
processes in your body you can't live

918.439 --> 925.309
without these triggers what have they

921.949 --> 927.41
done well they have known about the

925.309 --> 931.1
dangers of light emitting diode

927.41 --> 934.399
technology wavelength specific creation

931.1 --> 937.49
of reactive oxygen species in the

934.399 --> 939.379
presence of retinol in the eyes for

937.49 --> 943.669
decades folks and what have they done

939.379 --> 946.759
they've managed to con all of you to sit

943.669 --> 949.459
back and let them put LED screens in

946.759 --> 953.089
front of your face LED screens in your

949.459 --> 957.4699999999999
living room LED streetlights LED lights

953.089 --> 960.8000000000001
in your appliances LED everything folks

957.47 --> 963.4100000000001
and blue light is abounding

960.8 --> 965.209
and a ratio that is deadly for human

963.41 --> 969.319
health and I've spoken about this and

965.209 --> 970.9699999999999
here we go again why am i yelling well

969.319 --> 973.429
for crying out loud I'm on the freeway

970.97 --> 975.8290000000001
and I look behind me and they've even

973.429 --> 977.389
got the projector beams on the cars with

975.829 --> 980.059
bluish white light for crying out loud

977.389 --> 982.759
so that the lights are white on the

980.059 --> 985.009
street lights they're bluish white you

982.759 --> 987.559
know you got 5000 degree Kelvin lights

985.009 --> 990.11
all over the parking lots now folks it's

987.559 --> 993.6189999999999
a full moon every night this is horrible

990.11 --> 995.72
and if it's bad enough to go outside for

993.619 --> 997.399
a walk and then you get back in your

995.72 --> 1001.1700000000001
house and the TV looks like an alien

997.399 --> 1005.439
abduction series 24/7 every night

1001.17 --> 1008.139
everybody's TV set is so heavy on the

1005.439 --> 1013.449
blue light it's unbelievable it's not an

1008.139 --> 1015.069
accident they are killing you with the

1013.449 --> 1018.309
blue light folks they're killing you

1015.069 --> 1020.8789999999999
with your television now so what's going

1018.309 --> 1024.8799999999999
to come out of this is a half-baked

1020.879 --> 1026.83
study that has come out of some PhD

1024.88 --> 1030.13
students research

1026.83 --> 1032.02
now folks how many hundreds of billions

1030.13 --> 1035.14
of dollars in student loan money is

1032.02 --> 1037.93
outstanding and the only science these

1035.14 --> 1039.88
jackasses ever give us is coming from

1037.93 --> 1042.01
some graduate student some assistant

1039.88 --> 1044.2600000000002
professor no they've known about this

1042.01 --> 1045.85
stuff for twenty years why do you think

1044.26 --> 1047.98
they've spent twenty years developing

1045.85 --> 1050.23
these screens and these lighting

1047.98 --> 1053.44
technologies in the last five years

1050.23 --> 1056.08
try to find a way to con everybody into

1053.44 --> 1059.92
accepting it that's where it's at right

1056.08 --> 1063.46
now I'm mad because you're being

1059.92 --> 1068.28
destroyed and the children are gonna go

1063.46 --> 1070.81
blind and it's wrong and it's evil and

1068.28 --> 1075.28
these people that have invented these

1070.81 --> 1078.1299999999999
devices like bit like Steve Jobs who

1075.28 --> 1080.86
invented the iPad and Bill Gates who

1078.13 --> 1084.3700000000001
invented the Xbox who who whose platform

1080.86 --> 1087.8799999999999
it is doing so much damage forget this

1084.37 --> 1090.4299999999998
vaccine agenda that's killing everybody

1087.88 --> 1092.2
let's talk about these video games and

1090.43 --> 1094.6000000000001
the blue light addiction and

1092.2 --> 1096.04
proliferation can you imagine kids going

1094.6 --> 1098.1999999999998
blind do you know they're getting

1096.04 --> 1101.05
macular degeneration and detached

1098.2 --> 1105.22
retinas from their screen time oh and

1101.05 --> 1108.25
this one goes out to robert bletko and

1105.22 --> 1110.02
scott's Cumbrae of the fullerton school

1108.25 --> 1112.48
district who is the superintendent and

1110.02 --> 1114.45
the super ten of the 4chan joint Union

1112.48 --> 1117.57
High School District

1114.45 --> 1120.21
may God's judgment be upon you for

1117.57 --> 1120.989
forcing children to become addicted to

1120.21 --> 1124.44
the screens

1120.989 --> 1127.859
robert bletko for addicting children at

1124.44 --> 1130.5900000000001
the age of kindergarten on ipads

1127.859 --> 1132.9289999999999
where you have made your legacy in

1130.59 --> 1135.9289999999999
Fullerton in the fortune School District

1132.929 --> 1138.419
against years of my protests at board

1135.929 --> 1140.3690000000001
meetings tens of thousands of fliers on

1138.419 --> 1143.3090000000002
car windshields of sporting events

1140.369 --> 1145.35
back-to-school nights all kinds of

1143.309 --> 1147.45
things school board meetings City

1145.35 --> 1149.4889999999998
Council meetings all over the place and

1147.45 --> 1151.47
you still went ahead double down and

1149.489 --> 1153.21
triple down and put an iPad in the lap

1151.47 --> 1155.519
of every child getting them addicted to

1153.21 --> 1157.6190000000001
blue light all night which is a doorway

1155.519 --> 1159.84
to video games you know I used to hear

1157.619 --> 1162.509
this growing up that marijuana was a

1159.84 --> 1164.279
doorway to these these super dangerous

1162.509 --> 1167.279
drugs you know all these pot heads I

1164.279 --> 1169.019
grew up with some of them yeah they they

1167.279 --> 1171.779
didn't make it but most of them are fine

1169.019 --> 1174.8990000000001
but you know what these devices that the

1171.779 --> 1177.45
school districts have opened up these

1174.899 --> 1180.029
children to they're like freaking Ouija

1177.45 --> 1184.289
boards for kids folks because they're

1180.029 --> 1188.159
the doorway to addiction to internet

1184.289 --> 1190.889
gaming to all kinds of online filth and

1188.159 --> 1194.3690000000001
lies and degeneracy and these school

1190.889 --> 1196.1689999999999
districts are forcing children to have

1194.369 --> 1200.149
these devices all the way out of the

1196.169 --> 1200.1490000000001
card and I don't want to hear about

1200.45 --> 1205.43
I don't want to hear about oh my wife or

1203.63 --> 1208.1200000000001
my husband is a teacher and they're good

1205.43 --> 1210.8
people no folks you can't sit back and

1208.12 --> 1213.77
split these your kids stare at these

1210.8 --> 1215.48
squeezes making them go blind and I'm

1213.77 --> 1218.45
not even going into the fact of what the

1215.48 --> 1221.0
wireless radiation is doing this is all

1218.45 --> 1223.01
about the eyes tonight and being blinded

1221.0 --> 1226.19
by the blue light and the school

1223.01 --> 1228.05
districts are handed out the gateway

1226.19 --> 1231.05
drugs folks the iPads and the

1228.05 --> 1232.76
Chromebooks you heard me if school

1231.05 --> 1236.54
starts on Monday in the foregin school

1232.76 --> 1239.39
district then shame on you guys for

1236.54 --> 1241.9099999999999
being part of this scam and opening the

1239.39 --> 1244.3700000000001
door to the blue light at night you know

1241.91 --> 1245.66
I know people that hate the iPads and

1244.37 --> 1247.3999999999999
they hate what the schools have done to

1245.66 --> 1250.3400000000001
their kids and you want to know

1247.4 --> 1252.8300000000002
something I feel sorry for you I tried

1250.34 --> 1254.27
to stop it and all these people call me

1252.83 --> 1256.76
names when I'm out there on the sidewalk

1254.27 --> 1259.94
laughing at me yeah the cops the firemen

1256.76 --> 1261.26
in Fullerton the joke's on you guys cuz

1259.94 --> 1262.52
your kids got all kinds of health

1261.26 --> 1263.81
problems and none of them we're gonna

1262.52 --> 1266.24
have children's they've all been

1263.81 --> 1268.76
sterilized because you love your

1266.24 --> 1271.85
establishment connections and you love

1268.76 --> 1274.19
your salary so you subject your children

1271.85 --> 1276.11
to these agendas and you want to laugh

1274.19 --> 1277.3
at me the joke's on you my kids are

1276.11 --> 1280.0
protected

1277.3 --> 1282.7
my kids have not been exposed to this

1280.0 --> 1287.56
garbage I haven't put my kids in a

1282.7 --> 1290.13
microwave oven but you do but to those

1287.56 --> 1293.77
of you who are listening to my voice I

1290.13 --> 1295.71
know that you care that's why you're

1293.77 --> 1298.35
listening

1295.71 --> 1302.46
the fact of the matter is you need

1298.35 --> 1304.1999999999998
sunlight and you need to be exposed to

1302.46 --> 1306.96
sunlight without your sunglasses you

1304.2 --> 1310.2
need healthy full spectrum lighting from

1306.96 --> 1313.26
the Sun in its natural form that means

1310.2 --> 1315.39
you've got to go outside and get it that

1313.26 --> 1318.15
does not mean you follow the advice of

1315.39 --> 1320.25
these monsters and wear sunglasses all

1318.15 --> 1321.99
the time and not get any sunlight

1320.25 --> 1325.65
because you're afraid of the blue light

1321.99 --> 1330.56
during the day are you kidding me that's

1325.65 --> 1333.92
like being afraid of the mosquito fish

1330.56 --> 1336.69
in Lake Arrowhead when you're swimming

1333.92 --> 1339.1200000000001
are you kidding me and I've swam and

1336.69 --> 1340.53
Lake Heron and the mosquito fish we're

1339.12 --> 1342.7199999999998
about a millimeter long you think

1340.53 --> 1345.75
they're gonna bite me are you kidding me

1342.72 --> 1348.54
folks you cannot be afraid of the blue

1345.75 --> 1351.9
light component of sunlight you need it

1348.54 --> 1353.73
because that blue light component tells

1351.9 --> 1356.25
your body not to go to sleep and it

1353.73 --> 1359.34
keeps the melatonin levels from being

1356.25 --> 1361.8
secreted the melatonin from being

1359.34 --> 1363.12
secreted and the levels increased you

1361.8 --> 1364.0
don't want your body going to sleep

1363.12 --> 1365.32
during the day

1364.0 --> 1367.21
[Music]

1365.32 --> 1370.9199999999998
and don't get on me for drinking bottled

1367.21 --> 1370.92
water I was in a pinch today

1370.97 --> 1374.72
and I'm on the road I don't drink out a

1372.74 --> 1376.159
bottle water very often

1374.72 --> 1379.52
but you know what I don't have a

1376.159 --> 1382.25
drinking fountain in my car now back to

1379.52 --> 1384.71
the issue of hand and this is extremely

1382.25 --> 1387.38
important

1384.71 --> 1390.409
you need to stop the blue light exposure

1387.38 --> 1393.2600000000002
immediately in your home you need to go

1390.409 --> 1395.63
back to incandescent lighting you need

1393.26 --> 1398.09
to download filters on your computer

1395.63 --> 1400.5490000000002
screens that lower the color temperature

1398.09 --> 1403.58
of all your monitors down to 2700

1400.549 --> 1406.61
degrees Kelvin at sunset blue light at

1403.58 --> 1410.3899999999999
night is a weapon and I've talked about

1406.61 --> 1411.52
this and we've got proof scientific

1410.39 --> 1415.72
proof

1411.52 --> 1420.11
multiple sources then it kills your eyes

1415.72 --> 1424.64
blindness is something that is tragic

1420.11 --> 1426.4699999999998
folks spiritual blindness is even more

1424.64 --> 1428.539
tragic and I want to tell you something

1426.47 --> 1432.2
it is spiritual blindness that has

1428.539 --> 1433.49
allowed all of the blindness to become

1432.2 --> 1438.3400000000001
what it has become

1433.49 --> 1442.75
and to envelop and consume our society

1438.34 --> 1447.08
the light that goes through our eyes

1442.75 --> 1450.47
dictates what processes the body is to

1447.08 --> 1453.23
run if you start tinkering with the time

1450.47 --> 1457.179
of the day and the color temperature of

1453.23 --> 1458.769
that light you are tinkering

1457.179 --> 1460.929
back in Fullerton where the roads are

1458.769 --> 1463.45
crap I hope these city officials end up

1460.929 --> 1466.3590000000002
in jail I really do I keep bringing that

1463.45 --> 1468.6390000000001
up it's really bad the color temperature

1466.359 --> 1470.859
of the light and the timing that that

1468.639 --> 1472.9289999999999
color temperature lighting hits your

1470.859 --> 1477.489
eyes dictates how healthy you're gonna

1472.929 --> 1481.5700000000002
be the blue light is an agenda folks

1477.489 --> 1483.219
we're almost at the point where yeah

1481.57 --> 1485.019
they are AI trolls on here don't pay

1483.219 --> 1487.659
attention to them you know all the ones

1485.019 --> 1489.339
that make all these stupid comments I

1487.659 --> 1492.94
don't pay attention to them that's why I

1489.339 --> 1495.1589999999999
don't respond to them look folks you

1492.94 --> 1497.909
need to take precautions and protect

1495.159 --> 1501.5390000000002
your family

1497.909 --> 1505.3490000000002
Hollywood is run by a bunch of

1501.539 --> 1508.989
degenerate scum that are going to help

1505.349 --> 1510.9089999999999
and the movies they produce break every

1508.989 --> 1515.109
one of the Ten Commandments every 32

1510.909 --> 1519.249
seconds of every scene and they deliver

1515.109 --> 1522.6999999999998
it to you with a color that kills your

1519.249 --> 1525.159
eyes and destroys your health I want you

1522.7 --> 1528.3990000000001
to pay close attention and look at all

1525.159 --> 1530.6190000000001
the movies that are out on all of these

1528.399 --> 1532.059
platforms that are there streaming or

1530.619 --> 1535.539
beaming movies at you whether they're

1532.059 --> 1536.9189999999999
DVDs or all of these platforms whether

1535.539 --> 1539.08
it's a movie theater and look at the

1536.919 --> 1540.5800000000002
blog light that you're seeing it's all

1539.08 --> 1542.859
blue everything's blue all the scenes

1540.58 --> 1544.389
are in blue this weird tint to it

1542.859 --> 1548.259
nothing's natural anymore

1544.389 --> 1549.9599999999998
the color rendering index of the screen

1548.259 --> 1554.159
productions

1549.96 --> 1557.669
has become such that it acclimates you

1554.159 --> 1560.5390000000002
to never leave an environment that is

1557.669 --> 1564.63
conducive to poisoning you with that

1560.539 --> 1567.69
degree Kelvin temperature of lighting in

1564.63 --> 1570.1490000000001
other words all the movies have all

1567.69 --> 1571.799
these colors put in there to make you

1570.149 --> 1575.6689999999999
comfortable never leaving your house

1571.799 --> 1577.9189999999999
that is full of these colors now it's

1575.669 --> 1579.63
interesting I go to Home Depot once a

1577.919 --> 1581.789
week I've got to get acid for the pool

1579.63 --> 1584.279
and you know things break at the house

1581.789 --> 1585.72
and you know you're gonna need things

1584.279 --> 1587.58
you got to repair things that I always

1585.72 --> 1590.3990000000001
go by the lighting aisle and every time

1587.58 --> 1592.049
I go by I pay particular attention to

1590.399 --> 1594.1789999999999
the newfangled weapons I mean the

1592.049 --> 1596.01
newfangled inventions that they're

1594.179 --> 1597.6000000000001
coming out with all these LED lights and

1596.01 --> 1599.37
they have them on display so I'm

1597.6 --> 1603.23
unplugged in and turned on it every

1599.37 --> 1606.09
single one of them hurts my eyes folks I

1603.23 --> 1607.59
don't care what color rendering index or

1606.09 --> 1612.33
what color temperature they try to make

1607.59 --> 1615.779
these things every LED light hurts to

1612.33 --> 1619.279
look at and there's a reason folks LED

1615.779 --> 1621.779
lights are dangerous they hurt your eyes

1619.279 --> 1625.95
incandescent lights do not hurt your

1621.779 --> 1627.87
eyes the color temperature of a halogen

1625.95 --> 1631.52
or an incandescent light is somewhere

1627.87 --> 1637.2199999999998
between 2700 and 3,000 degrees Kelvin

1631.52 --> 1640.7
now these lights don't have the flicker

1637.22 --> 1643.99
that the LED lights have now let's talk

1640.7 --> 1648.679
about your monitors and your televisions

1643.99 --> 1650.66
the LED smart screen ule I'm telling you

1648.679 --> 1655.4
I see stuff at Costco I don't even know

1650.66 --> 1657.44
what it is I don't even understand what

1655.4 --> 1659.21
the what the meaning of some of these

1657.44 --> 1662.9
descriptions of these televisions are

1659.21 --> 1668.92
all I know is that these televisions in

1662.9 --> 1670.19
some cases cost more than my car it's

1668.92 --> 1673.1000000000001
unbelievable

1670.19 --> 1675.17
so they've got everybody staring at

1673.1 --> 1678.1399999999999
screens children do not use books

1675.17 --> 1681.1100000000001
anymore they don't look at the reflected

1678.14 --> 1683.5400000000002
light off of paper and print they look

1681.11 --> 1686.51
at backlit screens that destroy their

1683.54 --> 1690.55
eyes they look at backlit screens that

1686.51 --> 1693.19
causes macular degeneration hyperopia

1690.55 --> 1697.58
myopia nearsightedness farsightedness

1693.19 --> 1699.8600000000001
and blindness folks and all of this in a

1697.58 --> 1703.9399999999998
wireless environment

1699.86 --> 1705.7099999999998
you know I had to buy a a new router cuz

1703.94 --> 1707.8700000000001
my router conked out at home and it's

1705.71 --> 1710.179
something that you have to go in and

1707.87 --> 1712.6999999999998
disable the wireless on and it's not

1710.179 --> 1714.26
that difficult but boy they sure have

1712.7 --> 1716.45
everything pre-programmed pre-programmed

1714.26 --> 1718.01
to radiate you but nonetheless when I

1716.45 --> 1719.9
was at the store I was looking all these

1718.01 --> 1721.34
televisions and they were running

1719.9 --> 1723.1100000000001
different things different programs

1721.34 --> 1725.12
different things to get you to look at

1723.11 --> 1727.34
them but the blue light the amount of

1725.12 --> 1730.6999999999998
blue light is so unbelievably inordinate

1727.34 --> 1732.35
there's such a disparity between the the

1730.7 --> 1733.91
full spectrum of lighting and the amount

1732.35 --> 1736.309
of blue light in these television

1733.91 --> 1738.71
screens it's not reality and everybody

1736.309 --> 1740.8999999999999
stares at it folks I'm pleading with you

1738.71 --> 1743.39
you've got to understand how serious

1740.9 --> 1746.179
this problem is once your eyes are

1743.39 --> 1747.98
destroyed once the photoreceptors are

1746.179 --> 1751.52
destroyed in your eyes they don't grow

1747.98 --> 1753.94
back and these children because of the

1751.52 --> 1756.86
school district

1753.94 --> 1760.3400000000001
putting iPads into the laps of

1756.86 --> 1762.29
kindergarteners we have reached a point

1760.34 --> 1764.0
now where they're going to blind

1762.29 --> 1766.79
everybody and thus the title of this

1764.0 --> 1770.47
video blinded by blue light I'm not

1766.79 --> 1774.08
kidding blue light can make you go blind

1770.47 --> 1776.63
folks and they know it can they've

1774.08 --> 1781.46
weaponized all the lighting ladies and

1776.63 --> 1784.6100000000001
gentlemen all of the lighting all of the

1781.46 --> 1788.33
televisions all of the computer screens

1784.61 --> 1789.6789999999999
are now LED all the software it all has

1788.33 --> 1791.96
a default to blue-and-white

1789.679 --> 1795.3090000000002
blue-and-white blue-and-white everything

1791.96 --> 1797.96
is blue and white folks it's by design I

1795.309 --> 1801.1399999999999
cannot emphasize enough how important it

1797.96 --> 1805.49
is to not have any blue light at night

1801.14 --> 1807.8300000000002
in your eyes you have no idea what the

1805.49 --> 1810.3700000000001
what is riding on this now I'm not gonna

1807.83 --> 1813.59
repeat myself anymore

1810.37 --> 1815.6299999999999
but I will tell you another aspect of

1813.59 --> 1821.48
what I witnessed today with this

1815.63 --> 1826.3990000000001
information and that is how evidently

1821.48 --> 1830.289
clear to me it is that the true science

1826.399 --> 1836.059
I mean you could do a cursory review of

1830.289 --> 1840.279
photochemical reactions involving light

1836.059 --> 1844.9089999999999
emitting diode blue light frequencies

1840.279 --> 1847.279
with retinal compounds and you'll see

1844.909 --> 1852.529
studies that go back literally decades

1847.279 --> 1857.96
on how blue light creates reactive

1852.529 --> 1862.61
oxygen species in your eyes and destroys

1857.96 --> 1865.039
them now I did a video yesterday on the

1862.61 --> 1867.08
Bible ban and I want to talk to you

1865.039 --> 1872.75
about the last thing that is a crucial

1867.08 --> 1875.389
component of all of this and how Jesus

1872.75 --> 1877.909
Christ in his word and the Almighty

1875.389 --> 1879.799
father in heaven that has given us the

1877.909 --> 1882.019
Holy Bible for wisdom instruction

1879.799 --> 1884.36
reproof correction and a roadmap to

1882.019 --> 1886.519
eternal life and happiness and salvation

1884.36 --> 1888.83
it is so important that you listen to me

1886.519 --> 1889.72
folks in Genesis 1:28 as I talked about

1888.83 --> 1892.759
yesterday

1889.72 --> 1894.98
God spoke to Adam and Eve and he said

1892.759 --> 1897.1
behold I have given you every herb

1894.98 --> 1901.1490000000001
yielding seed in May

1897.1 --> 1902.799
BTU for meat yesterday I talked about

1901.149 --> 1904.149
something extremely important about the

1902.799 --> 1906.19
seeds folks and I talked about the

1904.149 --> 1910.5
nitrile aside compounds in these seeds

1906.19 --> 1915.13
and what I want to tell you today is

1910.5 --> 1918.87
another aspect to consuming seeds that

1915.13 --> 1920.0700000000002
are found in the herbs such as sour gum

1918.87 --> 1925.9289999999999
millet

1920.07 --> 1927.639
buckwheat spelt kamut and I forgot to

1925.929 --> 1928.8990000000001
mention apple seeds contain nitrile

1927.639 --> 1931.269
asides yesterday I can't remember

1928.899 --> 1932.7689999999998
everything and the grass is I brought up

1931.269 --> 1934.299
that the grasses contain I trill asides

1932.769 --> 1935.98
and it's good to eat grass fed meat

1934.299 --> 1937.99
because the meat usually contains the

1935.98 --> 1939.73
nitrile sites because the animal ate the

1937.99 --> 1941.74
grass and no I'm not a vegetarian ladies

1939.73 --> 1945.85
and gentlemen neither was Jesus Christ

1941.74 --> 1948.429
by the way now something extremely

1945.85 --> 1953.049
important about seeds is the following

1948.429 --> 1954.73
the seeds in their whole form whether it

1953.049 --> 1956.1689999999999
be a curtain by the way wheat contains

1954.73 --> 1957.22
absolutely no nitrile asides and that's

1956.169 --> 1959.71
where they're feeding it to us it's

1957.22 --> 1961.8700000000001
devoid of nitrile asides and they want

1959.71 --> 1964.059
us to be b-17 a Mingo and deficient

1961.87 --> 1965.59
intentionally that's why they weaponized

1964.059 --> 1967.0
the wheat with the glyphosate in a fetus

1965.59 --> 1968.98
corn and they feed the pigs in the cows

1967.0 --> 1971.08
corn that's they don't want the cows and

1968.98 --> 1972.429
the pigs eating the grasses they want

1971.08 --> 1973.6899999999998
them eating the corn that's full of the

1972.429 --> 1977.289
glyphosate with a wheat and everything

1973.69 --> 1979.72
else the seeds the kernels these grains

1977.289 --> 1982.179
ladies and gentlemen their seeds they

1979.72 --> 1984.82
contain fats and proteins because they

1982.179 --> 1986.3790000000001
basically have a QuickStart kit and

1984.82 --> 1987.759
genetic code for that to turn into

1986.379 --> 1990.1
another plant and let me tell you

1987.759 --> 1991.84
something folks very important you

1990.1 --> 1996.55
listen to me

1991.84 --> 1998.1699999999998
the seeds must be consumed whole you

1996.55 --> 1999.73
cannot eat flour because let me tell you

1998.17 --> 2002.69
what happens if you take a wheat kernel

1999.73 --> 2005.85
or a ride colonel or a barley kernel or

2002.69 --> 2007.38
any of these other graves spelt or melon

2005.85 --> 2010.9499999999998
any of these grains and you grind them

2007.38 --> 2013.67
up you immediately expose these to the

2010.95 --> 2016.1100000000001
atmosphere which contains oxygen and it

2013.67 --> 2019.38
oxidizes the essential fatty acid in

2016.11 --> 2022.04
this grain in all of these grains in

2019.38 --> 2027.8300000000002
these whole seeds there is a compound

2022.04 --> 2031.76
present called alpha tocopherol

2027.83 --> 2038.9199999999998
which is the antioxidant that is found

2031.76 --> 2043.97
in the seeds now this antioxidant

2038.92 --> 2049.7000000000003
reverses and stops and neutralizes

2043.97 --> 2052.2200000000003
listen to this the Ox the the reactive

2049.7 --> 2055.1299999999997
oxygen species that are produced by the

2052.22 --> 2059.4399999999996
ultraviolet interaction with retina is

2055.13 --> 2064.6400000000003
neutralized by antioxidants specifically

2059.44 --> 2071.929
D alpha tocopherol D alpha tocopherol is

2064.64 --> 2075.89
a fatty substance found in the seeds the

2071.929 --> 2083.12
bible tells us that the eye is the

2075.89 --> 2087.08
window to the soul that it is what is

2083.12 --> 2089.48
the only window to the soul folks the

2087.08 --> 2092.6
Bible tells us to eat the seeds the

2089.48 --> 2096.82
Bible tells us to eat the seeds the

2092.6 --> 2102.08
seeds have the solution to the problem

2096.82 --> 2106.55
the seeds contain the antioxidants that

2102.08 --> 2110.75
will stop the blindness now these

2106.55 --> 2113.69
tocopherols are found in the seeds these

2110.75 --> 2115.28
tocopherols are easy to get folks you

2113.69 --> 2116.33
eat the seeds in their whole form and

2115.28 --> 2117.8
I'm not telling you to go out to the

2116.33 --> 2120.08
field and start chewing them off the

2117.8 --> 2121.52
plant I'm saying buy the whole grains

2120.08 --> 2124.04
and eat the whole grains do not eat

2121.52 --> 2126.98
flour once flour is ground up it's

2124.04 --> 2129.11
oxidized it's exposed you can't have an

2126.98 --> 2132.7400000000002
antioxidant that has any usefulness if

2129.11 --> 2135.8900000000003
it's oxidized the d alpha tocopherol is

2132.74 --> 2139.1899999999996
an antioxidant it stops the reactive

2135.89 --> 2142.1
oxygen species from causing damage to

2139.19 --> 2144.59
the retina okay that's a fact folks eat

2142.1 --> 2146.42
the seeds in their whole form look I'm

2144.59 --> 2147.8
here to give you solutions folks I'm not

2146.42 --> 2148.549
here to scare you and tell you that

2147.8 --> 2150.38
there's nothing

2148.549 --> 2151.999
you like some of these freaks that wear

2150.38 --> 2154.13
sunglasses that never proclaim the name

2151.999 --> 2157.069
of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm gonna tell

2154.13 --> 2159.7090000000003
you the truth I'm gonna tell you how to

2157.069 --> 2163.569
save your family yeah I'm here to tell

2159.709 --> 2168.979
you who's lying to you it ain't me

2163.569 --> 2171.859
tocopherols in serial or synthetic you

2168.979 --> 2175.16
cannot get in oil in a powdered form

2171.859 --> 2177.2889999999998
ladies and gentlemen and oil is in oil

2175.16 --> 2180.709
and once it's in a powdered form its

2177.289 --> 2182.7490000000003
garbage you want to know how I know that

2180.709 --> 2183.859
just besides my chemistry background by

2182.749 --> 2185.1189999999997
the way I'm a bachelor's degree in

2183.859 --> 2188.179
chemistry and a bachelor's degree in

2185.119 --> 2189.4390000000003
biological science from UCI I didn't

2188.179 --> 2193.009
just fall off the turnip truck but I'll

2189.439 --> 2194.779
tell you something folks everybody that

2193.009 --> 2196.29
has a grapevine knows that rats love

2194.779 --> 2198.12
grapes

2196.29 --> 2199.32
and everybody that has a grapevine knows

2198.12 --> 2202.35
that if you don't get rid of the rats

2199.32 --> 2203.9700000000003
delete your grapes and I am an expert at

2202.35 --> 2205.5
dealing with rats because I've been

2203.97 --> 2207.5699999999997
dealing grape vines since I was five

2205.5 --> 2210.09
years old folks my dad was an Italian

2207.57 --> 2212.61
and we've always had grape vines and I

2210.09 --> 2215.2200000000003
eat grapes for every day of my life four

2212.61 --> 2218.2200000000003
months of the year as a matter of fact I

2215.22 --> 2219.99
have at least eight different types of

2218.22 --> 2222.27
grape vines on my property and right now

2219.99 --> 2223.7099999999996
I'm enjoying these Norton blended with

2222.27 --> 2226.2
Conchords and let me tell you what I got

2223.71 --> 2227.82
to do I got to have some rat traps and I

2226.2 --> 2230.37
put peanut butter on these rat traps and

2227.82 --> 2231.42
let me tell you something folks I get

2230.37 --> 2233.37
the peanut butter for the nine dots

2231.42 --> 2235.2200000000003
tensor because it's a buck and one thing

2233.37 --> 2238.17
lasts me a whole summer for the traps

2235.22 --> 2239.5499999999997
well this is cheap peanut butter you

2238.17 --> 2243.78
know what they make it out of yeah they

2239.55 --> 2247.0800000000004
make it out of peanuts in palm oil and

2243.78 --> 2249.48
peanut butter and peanut oil but it's

2247.08 --> 2251.58
mostly dehydrated peanut powder folks

2249.48 --> 2253.359
and you know what happens

2251.58 --> 2255.819
[Music]

2253.359 --> 2259.0589999999997
the rats won't go near the trap after a

2255.819 --> 2261.519
couple of days if the peanut oil all

2259.059 --> 2263.8900000000003
dries up and all that's left is the

2261.519 --> 2265.7189999999996
peanut powder I've got to put fresh

2263.89 --> 2268.1189999999997
peanut butter on those traps now it's

2265.719 --> 2271.599
still peanut powder it's still got

2268.119 --> 2273.6400000000003
tocopherols in the peanut powder but

2271.599 --> 2275.559
guess what they're oxidized folks and

2273.64 --> 2280.5989999999997
even the rats know better than to eat

2275.559 --> 2282.849
that garbage and what do we do you read

2280.599 --> 2285.2690000000002
the ingredients he'll tell you that

2282.849 --> 2287.739
these cereals have mixed tocopherols

2285.269 --> 2289.959
because they don't want to tell you that

2287.739 --> 2292.809
they're putting DL alpha tocopherol in

2289.959 --> 2296.319
the cereal which is a synthetic isomer

2292.809 --> 2299.469
of D alpha tocopherol which is the

2296.319 --> 2301.66
naturally occurring healthy version any

2299.469 --> 2302.859
time you take a synthetic version of

2301.66 --> 2305.459
something you put in your body you're

2302.859 --> 2308.92
asking for trouble

2305.459 --> 2310.779
stop it wake up stop poisoning your

2308.92 --> 2314.319
family I've already talked about these

2310.779 --> 2317.559
poisonous cereals look folks here's the

2314.319 --> 2321.13
deal if any of these churches were worth

2317.559 --> 2323.619
a damn they would tell you what the

2321.13 --> 2325.059
Bible says you know what I've just got a

2323.619 --> 2327.67
bachelor's degree I don't have a

2325.059 --> 2329.259
seminary degree I'm not a scientist but

2327.67 --> 2331.599
you know what I take the trouble to read

2329.259 --> 2333.729
and incorporate knowledge and wisdom and

2331.599 --> 2335.7090000000003
why can't these pastors and these

2333.729 --> 2338.3799999999997
scientists do it no we've got these

2335.709 --> 2339.459
people that are working on their PhD

2338.38 --> 2342.4590000000003
they are the ones releasing this

2339.459 --> 2344.859
information students and associate

2342.459 --> 2346.299
professors we got these guys walking

2344.859 --> 2348.729
around these halls in these institutions

2346.299 --> 2349.959
there were paying billions of dollars to

2348.729 --> 2352.5389999999998
subsidize these higher learning

2349.959 --> 2354.519
facilities and they're not turning out

2352.539 --> 2357.4
anything that's worth a damn

2354.519 --> 2361.3199999999997
but garbage and the truth has to be

2357.4 --> 2364.2400000000002
found by kids are you kidding me

2361.32 --> 2366.34
why am i so mad folks because I live in

2364.24 --> 2369.0099999999998
Fullerton this place is full of colleges

2366.34 --> 2370.7200000000003
and these pompous moronic imbeciles that

2369.01 --> 2372.3700000000003
work for the colleges and all because

2370.72 --> 2374.7999999999997
they think they're so smart cos they're

2372.37 --> 2376.48
professors they're a bunch of idiots and

2374.8 --> 2378.4300000000003
you know what sorry these pastors don't

2376.48 --> 2379.81
talk about this stuff is it my fault

2378.43 --> 2382.81
they don't know it no you know what if

2379.81 --> 2384.7
they spent all week studying it do you

2382.81 --> 2386.59
know that I have a full-time job ladies

2384.7 --> 2388.96
and gentlemen and then I have a family

2386.59 --> 2392.32
and I don't have a week to study this

2388.96 --> 2393.79
stuff I work every day these pastors you

2392.32 --> 2396.8500000000004
know what they do they sleep at least

2393.79 --> 2399.25
sleep but they don't work they got all

2396.85 --> 2401.44
week to study this stuff they work an

2399.25 --> 2403.57
hour a week at church and I'm not gonna

2401.44 --> 2406.51
knock them all because the church I go

2403.57 --> 2407.86
to the guy's a really nice guy but you

2406.51 --> 2410.86
know what the majorities guys are bunch

2407.86 --> 2412.9300000000003
of lazy bums and why aren't they using

2410.86 --> 2415.96
God's Word to save God's people you know

2412.93 --> 2417.58
what God didn't spend nine months making

2415.96 --> 2422.71
you and I in the womb so we could trash

2417.58 --> 2424.72
our bodies why is that why is it that

2422.71 --> 2427.18
that's ignored why is it that the truth

2424.72 --> 2430.0
of the Bible about how to keep us alive

2427.18 --> 2434.3799999999997
is hidden from God's people by the

2430.0 --> 2438.04
pastor's themselves why because they're

2434.38 --> 2440.38
blind because they're spiritually blind

2438.04 --> 2442.6
and they're going to become physically

2440.38 --> 2446.4300000000003
blind as a result ladies and gentlemen

2442.6 --> 2451.24
and blindness by blue light is a sad

2446.43 --> 2453.7
reality that we're all facing now to

2451.24 --> 2455.77
recap this if you've just joined me

2453.7 --> 2457.99
here's a solution

2455.77 --> 2460.66
you don't wear your sunglasses during

2457.99 --> 2464.8599999999997
the day maybe you should wear them at

2460.66 --> 2467.19
night and I'm not kidding you need to

2464.86 --> 2471.52
eat whole grains and foods like avocados

2467.19 --> 2474.88
and fish that contain antioxidants in

2471.52 --> 2478.24
their raw and unoxidized form and you

2474.88 --> 2481.4500000000003
cannot get an oil in a powder so the

2478.24 --> 2484.14
cereals contain poison worthless deadly

2481.45 --> 2488.3799999999997
synthetic took a pharaoh powder

2484.14 --> 2490.54
you must eat the whole grains now you

2488.38 --> 2492.07
buy wheat berries or oats whole oats not

2490.54 --> 2494.38
that not the ones that are all ground up

2492.07 --> 2496.03
in there like these flakes anytime you

2494.38 --> 2499.06
cut open a seed it ain't going to grow

2496.03 --> 2500.9500000000003
folks and dries out it oxidizes the seed

2499.06 --> 2503.41
needs to be in tact with its shell

2500.95 --> 2505.5099999999998
intact to protect the precious genetic

2503.41 --> 2507.64
code and the precious essential fatty

2505.51 --> 2510.07
acids that are necessary for seed

2507.64 --> 2512.41
germination and healthy plant growth the

2510.07 --> 2514.6000000000004
same applies for that to be a properly

2512.41 --> 2516.7599999999998
balanced nutritious food source

2514.6 --> 2519.77
you can't adult treat it destroy it

2516.76 --> 2521.2200000000003

2528.71 --> 2534.03
and I love the truth and don't pay

2532.47 --> 2535.4399999999996
attention to these troll comments

2534.03 --> 2538.05
because it's getting pretty top-heavy

2535.44 --> 2542.31
with the artificial intelligence because

2538.05 --> 2544.23

2542.31 --> 2547.44

2544.23 --> 2552.3
fashion but I'm not gonna take the bait
