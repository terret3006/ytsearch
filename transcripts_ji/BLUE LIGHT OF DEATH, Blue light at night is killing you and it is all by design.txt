18.859 --> 23.660000000000004
folks this is John Brianna coming to you

20.929 --> 27.32
once again I'm the Fullerton Informer

23.66 --> 29.09
and every time I come and talk to you

27.32 --> 30.89
about this kind of stuff it's not for a

29.09 --> 32.87
good reason folks and it's not because I

30.89 --> 35.449
like to talk about this but because I

32.87 --> 37.3
have to talk about this and quite

35.449 --> 43.22
frankly we don't have a lot of time and

37.3 --> 47.839
we're being surrounded by weaponry I'm

43.22 --> 49.22
in a room right now that if the Wesson

47.839 --> 54.079
for electricity would be completely dark

49.22 --> 55.85
now we've become accustomed to lighting

54.079 --> 58.309
folks we've become accustomed to

55.85 --> 60.92
flipping a switch and having the

58.309 --> 63.649
darkness disappear and the problem with

60.92 --> 68.42
that is our bodies were not designed by

63.649 --> 70.789
God to be in that environment this is a

68.42 --> 73.94
light really inexpensive light that I

70.789 --> 80.09
got a Dollar Tree and I want you to look

73.94 --> 82.569
at this this is an LED light and it's

80.09 --> 86.869
not the shape of this that's a concern

82.569 --> 91.489
and it's not the brightness that's a

86.869 --> 94.34
concern but the color of the light it's

91.489 --> 96.319
a little weird isn't it you know growing

94.34 --> 97.31
up light bulbs rose orange that's just

96.319 --> 99.349
the way lights are lights were

97.31 --> 101.06
headlights were always an orange on the

99.349 --> 103.16
cars it's just the way they were I mean

101.06 --> 104.63
I just thought light bulbs gave off

103.16 --> 105.89
orange light because that that's the

104.63 --> 108.34899999999999
only light bulb everybody and then came

105.89 --> 111.53
along these fluorescent lights that they

108.349 --> 112.759
put in the schools I remember when they

111.53 --> 113.84
put these in first time I saw

112.759 --> 115.16
fluorescent lighting when I went to

113.84 --> 117.379
college because when I went to high

115.16 --> 119.59899999999999
school I went to Catholic schools we had

117.379 --> 121.22
light bulbs hanging in basically

119.599 --> 125.06
lighting fixtures from the ceiling made

121.22 --> 129.14
clear windows we didn't have different

125.06 --> 133.58
types of lighting we do now did you know

129.14 --> 135.61999999999998
that lighting is a weapon I've talked

133.58 --> 138.53
about Wireless I've talked about how

135.62 --> 140.42000000000002
they close the walls in with us brace

138.53 --> 143.51
basically broadcasting through our walls

140.42 --> 145.30999999999997
with the cellular systems and how people

143.51 --> 146.17999999999998
have now brought these wireless

145.31 --> 148.4
microwave systems

146.18 --> 151.70000000000002
their homes with their Wi-Fi and while

148.4 --> 153.56
and systems in and repeaters and Wi-Fi

151.7 --> 155.98899999999998
boosters and all of these things that

153.56 --> 161.409
are destroying your health but I wanted

155.989 --> 166.79
to talk to you tonight about blue light

161.409 --> 168.59
blue light is a weapon folks I'm going

166.79 --> 170.32899999999998
to repeat this blue light is a weapon

168.59 --> 172.489
though guess what gives off blue light

170.329 --> 175.43
well the biggest source of blue light at

172.489 --> 178.689
your home is your television I like to

175.43 --> 181.639
refer to as the idiot box or hell vision

178.689 --> 185.709
but it's destroying your health when

181.639 --> 188.81
blue light enters your eyes at night

185.709 --> 190.81900000000002
it totally disrupts all of the natural

188.81 --> 193.939
processes that are supposed to be taking

190.819 --> 196.33999999999997
place at night in the absence of blue

193.939 --> 199.459
and white light your body began

196.34 --> 201.349
secreting melatonin melatonin is a sleep

199.459 --> 206.409
hormone when the blue and white light

201.349 --> 209.51
goes away at sunset your body says okay

206.409 --> 215.06
it's time to go to bed well what do we

209.51 --> 218.44
do when that time of the day comes we

215.06 --> 218.44
turn on a light now

219.22 --> 225.439
we don't turn on this kind of light we

221.959 --> 229.099
turn on another LED type of light you

225.439 --> 231.319
can look at this it has flicker are you

229.099 --> 236.29899999999998
noticing that it flickers because it

231.319 --> 238.48899999999998
does flickers another component of this

236.299 --> 243.37900000000002
weaponry folks incandescent lights don't

238.489 --> 246.139
flicker LEDs they pulse your television

243.379 --> 247.63899999999998
is killing me that blue light that

246.139 --> 249.109
you're getting in through your eyes at

247.639 --> 251.15
night is killing you it's taking years

249.109 --> 252.25
off your life when your body is supposed

251.15 --> 256.909
to be asleep

252.25 --> 259.459
and it is being told by light signals

256.909 --> 262.19
which basically transmit information to

259.459 --> 264.68
your body about the time of the day it

262.19 --> 266.15
is and what to do and what bodily

264.68 --> 267.56
functions are supposed to kick in what

266.15 --> 270.919
bodily functions are supposed to shut

267.56 --> 275.93
off when you go to bed and you go to

270.919 --> 277.27
sleep you have to think to breathe do

275.93 --> 279.13
you have to think

277.27 --> 280.71999999999997
to pump your blood these are all

279.13 --> 283.2
autonomic functions these are part of

280.72 --> 286.93
your parasympathetic system of your body

283.2 --> 289.59999999999997
these functions take place without you

286.93 --> 292.93
being aware of them taking place during

289.6 --> 294.70000000000005
the day every single thing you do moving

292.93 --> 297.34000000000003
your hands moving your head moving your

294.7 --> 301.93
eyelids whatever it is talking is a

297.34 --> 304.33
conscious choice that your brain makes

301.93 --> 306.04
as a result of you attending your body

304.33 --> 309.03999999999996
to make these choices and these

306.04 --> 310.98
movements and these actions at night

309.04 --> 313.90000000000003
it's a completely different system now

310.98 --> 317.62
when you introduce blue light into your

313.9 --> 320.67999999999995
environment at night you are disrupting

317.62 --> 322.36
all of these autonomic processes and all

320.68 --> 324.13
of the healing processes when you go to

322.36 --> 326.08000000000004
when you go to bed at night your brain

324.13 --> 328.09
starts reshuffling all that information

326.08 --> 329.40999999999997
that you process during the day that's

328.09 --> 331.11999999999995
why you have these dreams and you're

329.41 --> 333.40000000000003
pulling up stuff from the file cabinet

331.12 --> 334.38
from 25 years ago and it's mixed in with

333.4 --> 336.72999999999996
something that happened the other day

334.38 --> 338.98
that's just a process that goes on in

336.73 --> 340.09000000000003
your mind folks that is why we have the

338.98 --> 341.86
dreams that we have is just a

340.09 --> 343.81
reshuffling Andry storage of information

341.86 --> 345.58000000000004
it's kind of defrag a computer put stuff

343.81 --> 348.91
in a different folder where it needs to

345.58 --> 354.55
be to save space on the hard drive you

348.91 --> 356.74
cannot alter these processes you want to

354.55 --> 359.14
know why all these men have prostate

356.74 --> 363.67
cancer do you want to know why all these

359.14 --> 365.83
men are taken viagra in their 40s it's

363.67 --> 369.46000000000004
because of the laptop emitting microwave

365.83 --> 372.28
emissions right on their lap right where

369.46 --> 376.59999999999997
the prostate is and the blue light at

372.28 --> 378.03
night from the television set yes ladies

376.6 --> 381.84000000000003
and gentlemen you heard me

378.03 --> 384.64
endocrine cancers such as prostate

381.84 --> 387.58
cancers hormonal cancer such as ovarian

384.64 --> 390.09999999999997
cancer and breast cancer these are all a

387.58 --> 392.46999999999997
direct result of blue light exposure at

390.1 --> 396.19
night and we've been being dosed for

392.47 --> 398.11
decades with the hella vision but now

396.19 --> 401.08
there's another component that is

398.11 --> 405.40000000000003
equally problematic and then as your

401.08 --> 407.32
cell phone did it occur to you that they

405.4 --> 410.71999999999997
chose the blue light for your phone at

407.32 --> 412.25
night intentionally

410.72 --> 415.21000000000004
you know how much blue light is in the

412.25 --> 417.86
cell phone emissions it's by design

415.21 --> 419.27
ladies and gentlemen these people that

417.86 --> 421.52000000000004
run the world that run these

419.27 --> 422.03
corporations it's not just about the

421.52 --> 424.90999999999997
money

422.03 --> 428.05999999999995
the money is a side effect it is a

424.91 --> 430.76000000000005
windfall of carrying out the agenda the

428.06 --> 434.63
agenda is to sicken us and to kill us

430.76 --> 436.21999999999997
off and to make us observant so that

434.63 --> 438.71
they can carry out the nefarious plans

436.22 --> 444.35
for total domination and elimination of

438.71 --> 446.69
99% of us you heard me the technology

444.35 --> 450.26000000000005
that is being deployed whether it be

446.69 --> 451.85
your phone your computer your gigantic

450.26 --> 453.26
television that you're so proud of that

451.85 --> 455.72
you just stuck in the back of your SUV

453.26 --> 458.45
and drove it home from Costco the thing

455.72 --> 460.19000000000005
you just spent $4,000 on and you just

458.45 --> 462.53
bought all this furniture to sit in

460.19 --> 467.9
front of it and watch it with is killing

462.53 --> 475.0
you blue light at night through your

467.9 --> 480.53
eyes sets you up for cancer prostate

475.0 --> 485.3
testicular breast hole any type of

480.53 --> 487.01
hormonal cancers pancreatic I'm just

485.3 --> 490.49
telling you folks you don't understand

487.01 --> 492.71
and maybe now you do but you have got to

490.49 --> 493.97
shut off your television at night and if

492.71 --> 496.37
you're going to use your computer at

493.97 --> 499.79
night you need to use a filter on it you

496.37 --> 502.7
can download a filter to change the

499.79 --> 506.08000000000004
color temperature of your screen you

502.7 --> 509.39
need to have lighting and emissions

506.08 --> 511.669
photo emissions under 3,000 degrees

509.39 --> 512.8389999999999
Kelvin in other words look it up there's

511.669 --> 514.25
things you can put on your computer that

512.839 --> 516.5300000000001
will bring the color temperature off

514.25 --> 519.8
your monitor down around 2700 which is a

516.53 --> 523.52
warm orange glow which is what the old

519.8 --> 525.9499999999999
incandescent lights used to be do not

523.52 --> 528.1999999999999
buy lighting that has a color

525.95 --> 531.11
temperature in excess of 2700 degrees

528.2 --> 533.96
Kelvin now here's another component of

531.11 --> 536.02
this whole thing they've banned the

533.96 --> 538.3100000000001
production and importation of

536.02 --> 539.9
incandescent light bulbs in the United

538.31 --> 542.5999999999999
States of America and that is by design

539.9 --> 545.75
folks they don't want you having ax

542.6 --> 548.5400000000001
test to the right light bulbs they want

545.75 --> 550.22
you to buy these LED lights do you know

548.54 --> 553.31
that you can get these things of the

550.22 --> 556.2090000000001
99-cent store now they are flooding the

553.31 --> 559.6099999999999
market with the weaponry that you know

556.209 --> 563.3599999999999
when I was a child I have to admit this

559.61 --> 566.72
up I loved soda pop it tasted so good

563.36 --> 570.5
and back when I was a child it was

566.72 --> 573.259
expensive I remember though back in the

570.5 --> 577.88
70s that it was about a dollar twenty

573.259 --> 579.98
nine for a two-liter bottle of Pepsi or

577.88 --> 585.68
coca-cola whichever one you prefer do

579.98 --> 588.44
you go now forty years later but it

585.68 --> 591.829
still costs a dollar for a two-liter

588.44 --> 594.889
bottle of Pepsi or coca-cola how does

591.829 --> 597.019
that possible that something that costs

594.889 --> 599.389
a dollar forty years ago still costs a

597.019 --> 601.79
dollar today when the production costs

599.389 --> 603.8
the energy cost of insurance costs the

601.79 --> 606.05
workers comp cost the everything cost

603.8 --> 608.93
has gone up five hundred percent to a

606.05 --> 611.18
thousand percent it's because they want

608.93 --> 614.209
you to have access to it and they're

611.18 --> 616.3389999999999
subsidizing its existence and they're

614.209 --> 618.68
subsidizing the delivery of it to your

616.339 --> 620.509
home and to your bloodstream that is

618.68 --> 623.8389999999999
exactly what is happening with these

620.509 --> 625.67
lighting systems now I want to go to

623.839 --> 627.769
another component of this have you

625.67 --> 629.66
noticed the headlights on the cars how

627.769 --> 631.37
much they hurt your eyes now how bright

629.66 --> 633.649
they are and what about these street

631.37 --> 635.86
lights are putting in how do you notice

633.649 --> 639.139
the color that the street lights is now

635.86 --> 640.339
they've changed they used to be kind of

639.139 --> 642.62
orange they used to be these high

640.339 --> 645.5
pressure sodium lamps kind of like a

642.62 --> 646.79
weird orange glow little dull but did

645.5 --> 648.74
keep you awake didn't hurts your eyes

646.79 --> 651.5
didn't give you a headache you look at

648.74 --> 654.439
the lights on the streets now you look

651.5 --> 657.199
what they've done they've got a bluish

654.439 --> 660.529
white color temperature - it's an eerie

657.199 --> 662.12
moonlight glow every night you're being

660.529 --> 664.579
exposed to the equivalent of a full moon

662.12 --> 666.949
folks you're not supposed to be in full

664.579 --> 669.8599999999999
moonlight every night there's a reason

666.949 --> 671.899
God gave us a full moon once a month it

669.86 --> 673.25
was for us to get caught up on the work

671.899 --> 675.86
in the field that will Lex

673.25 --> 679.49
time outside with the animals but now

675.86 --> 682.52
we've got a full moon every night of the

679.49 --> 684.8
year in our living room and on the

682.52 --> 686.48
streets at the gas station at the

684.8 --> 690.91
restaurants they changed the lights

686.48 --> 694.78
everywhere to kill you

690.91 --> 699.26
the lighting systems are a weapon folks

694.78 --> 703.51
this is not an accident this is a proven

699.26 --> 708.47
scientific fact that blue light at night

703.51 --> 712.31
causes hormonal and endocrine cancers so

708.47 --> 714.2900000000001
why is it that every device known to man

712.31 --> 716.54
that is used at night that is being

714.29 --> 717.89
proliferated and marketed in the United

716.54 --> 720.68
States of America and all over the world

717.89 --> 723.97
for that matter emits blue light why

720.68 --> 723.9699999999999
couldn't they use a different color

729.85 --> 736.149
I haven't watched television for over 20

734.529 --> 738.519
years and there's a good reason for that

736.149 --> 740.889
folks because I'm not going to let them

738.519 --> 743.079
destroy my mind with the garbage and the

740.889 --> 747.339
filth they're put now and the lies and

743.079 --> 750.069
the crap and the twisted baloney that

747.339 --> 751.75
they fill everybody's heads with but I

750.069 --> 756.399
will tell you this when I go for a walk

751.75 --> 758.62
at night I can see in every house it

756.399 --> 761.47
looks like an alien abduction taking

758.62 --> 763.69
place with that blue glow flickering in

761.47 --> 765.3100000000001
the living rooms or in the bedrooms as I

763.69 --> 766.9590000000001
walk by these homes where no one's

765.31 --> 768.8499999999999
outside walking around on a beautiful

766.959 --> 770.5889999999999
night when I can hear the crickets and I

768.85 --> 773.44
can see the city lights shimmering and

770.589 --> 775.389
there's a nice nice breeze kind of like

773.44 --> 776.62
a seals and Crofts song from the

775.389 --> 778.269
seventies you know just a really

776.62 --> 779.949
wonderful experience being outside the

778.269 --> 782.019
fresh air and smelling the jasmine and

779.949 --> 786.269
the springtime you know folks something

782.019 --> 788.79
that you ought to do they're killing you

786.269 --> 791.29
they're killing you on purpose and

788.79 --> 793.449
they're getting you to do it all by

791.29 --> 796.269
yourself and they're actually getting

793.449 --> 798.069
you to be in anticipation of the Nick

796.269 --> 799.329
the newest and latest and greatest

798.069 --> 801.88
product that they're going to roll out

799.329 --> 804.3389999999999
next more high-definition television

801.88 --> 812.35
more highly hydrated resolution more

804.339 --> 815.5
flicker rate potential you know it's

812.35 --> 818.0790000000001
just a shame because they're not going

815.5 --> 819.37
to tell you about this at school they're

818.079 --> 821.1389999999999
not going to tell you about this on

819.37 --> 823.2090000000001
television they're not going to tell you

821.139 --> 824.41
about this on sugar at church they're

823.209 --> 827.2299999999999
not going to tell you about this on the

824.41 --> 830.889
internet so I got to tell you about this

827.23 --> 835.029
and I want you to listen to me you need

830.889 --> 838.199
to understand something they don't like

835.029 --> 844.99
you and when I say they there are

838.199 --> 847.8389999999999
satanic pedophile murderers you Genesis

844.99 --> 853.269
that run our government that run these

847.839 --> 855.8800000000001
corporations I have friends in many

853.269 --> 857.949
places high places low places I've got a

855.88 --> 860.5
lot of connections folks thousands and

857.949 --> 861.55
thousands of connections I know who's

860.5 --> 863.35
getting on a target

861.55 --> 865.029
these airports these private jets and I

863.35 --> 867.4590000000001
know who gets on these jets with these

865.029 --> 869.2
people that have the money for this kind

867.459 --> 873.399
of stuff and I know what kind of stuff

869.2 --> 876.61
goes on and ain't pretty and I'm not

873.399 --> 880.93
making this up you see when you get tons

876.61 --> 885.37
of money and you become filthy rich you

880.93 --> 887.5
become insane and your lust goes beyond

885.37 --> 890.68
the need for money and material thinks

887.5 --> 894.57
it then becomes a desire for power and

890.68 --> 898.0
then when you get power and money

894.57 --> 901.47
your lust and desire for things exceeds

898.0 --> 904.45
material possessions and money and power

901.47 --> 908.1700000000001
it gets into the dark spiritual realm

904.45 --> 910.72
folks and these people in very high

908.17 --> 914.1999999999999
places with tremendous wealth are

910.72 --> 916.149
plugged in to dark spiritual forces of

914.2 --> 919.24
wickedness in high places yes you heard

916.149 --> 921.19
me folks satanic power and that's why

919.24 --> 923.62
they have all these esoteric symbols on

921.19 --> 925.4200000000001
their products and at their corporate

923.62 --> 933.3100000000001
headquarters landscape architecture

925.42 --> 935.89
design I'm so glad that you've all got

933.31 --> 937.329
nothing better to do tonight because to

935.89 --> 939.8199999999999
be honest with you you're really smart

937.329 --> 942.1899999999999
people for being here because most

939.82 --> 946.029
people could care less about what really

942.19 --> 947.7090000000001
matters yeah you know I know no it took

946.029 --> 949.57
a hundred years to build that Ark and

947.709 --> 950.9499999999999
they thought it was a nut job and I want

949.57 --> 956.0100000000001
to tell you some of his kids inherited

950.95 --> 960.22
the earth Apple is a cult

956.01 --> 961.48
it's the cult of Mac Apple spending five

960.22 --> 962.23
million dollars on his corporate

961.48 --> 964.24
headquarters

962.23 --> 967.39
people love half the stock it performs

964.24 --> 969.699
well tobacco stock perform really well

967.39 --> 973.149
too for a long time that says corporate

969.699 --> 974.079
headquarters ladies and gentlemen I want

973.149 --> 976.18
to show you something

974.079 --> 977.709
I go to City Council these I read plans

976.18 --> 980.019
Planning Commission is all kinds of

977.709 --> 981.6099999999999
stuff that right there as a slide off of

980.019 --> 982.93
the landscape architecture science

981.61 --> 984.899
actually taken from a video their

982.93 --> 988.0899999999999
attention to Cupertino City Council I

984.899 --> 989.83
want you to look at this

988.09 --> 991.36
that's a lot for the landscape

989.83 --> 992.5600000000001
architecture plans this is the layout of

991.36 --> 993.52
how they're going to leave the place out

992.56 --> 996.43
in terms of where they're going to put

993.52 --> 998.74
the picnic benches and the trees you

996.43 --> 1002.55
notice any similarity to the spawn here

998.74 --> 1006.42
and this guy over here let me take it a

1002.55 --> 1009.81
step further because this was you in the

1006.42 --> 1013.05
two cell stage and this is Apple's

1009.81 --> 1014.6999999999999
corporate headquarters can you see

1013.05 --> 1017.75
what's happening to the nucleus ladies

1014.7 --> 1022.59
and gentlemen let's get electrocuted

1017.75 --> 1025.89
that's just one slide now I'm not a

1022.59 --> 1028.17
gambler but the odds of that are like

1025.89 --> 1033.2700000000002
putting your life savings on boxcars at

1028.17 --> 1035.93
the craps table as this blog odds what's

1033.27 --> 1035.93
going on here

1038.07 --> 1040.74
all right so here's a little

1039.36 --> 1043.59
black-and-white version just to make a

1040.74 --> 1047.19
little clearer for you what are the odds

1043.59 --> 1050.79
of the Landscape Architecture plan from

1047.19 --> 1052.44
a satanic company that has put an iPad

1050.79 --> 1055.1399999999999
and elapsing other school-aged child the

1052.44 --> 1058.8600000000001
United States doing this kind of stuff

1055.14 --> 1062.5200000000002
in light of this kind of stuff from 40

1058.86 --> 1065.76
years ago what are the odds father in

1062.52 --> 1068.82
Jesus name may you open the eyes of

1065.76 --> 1070.53
these people that are here and just have

1068.82 --> 1074.04
them understand that this is all real

1070.53 --> 1075.81
and this is not a joke please father and

1074.04 --> 1079.47
grant us protection and spread this

1075.81 --> 1083.54
information to whom much is given much

1079.47 --> 1083.54
is required in Jesus

1084.38 --> 1090.41
this is a sketch done Apple's corporate

1087.919 --> 1092.48
headquarters written up by an architect

1090.41 --> 1096.049
once again off the Cupertino City

1092.48 --> 1098.419
Council website this is the center of

1096.049 --> 1099.8899999999999
the complex it's like a spaceship

1098.419 --> 1101.75
looking thing but I want to take your

1099.89 --> 1111.1000000000001
attention to this diagram right here can

1101.75 --> 1111.1
everybody see that so that is this

1111.429 --> 1116.1000000000001
missing that

1114.03 --> 1117.9289999999999
[Music]

1116.1 --> 1119.9699999999998
I spent five years as you see I'm

1117.929 --> 1122.8200000000002
looking at this stuff looking at stuff

1119.97 --> 1124.44
under electron microscopes do all kinds

1122.82 --> 1126.6
of bizarre things as at the time when I

1124.44 --> 1128.429
was in my 20s I wasn't even aware of

1126.6 --> 1129.75
what I was doing I was just doing it and

1128.429 --> 1131.039
figuring out how to do it right so I

1129.75 --> 1134.4
could get the grades I needed to

1131.039 --> 1137.429
graduate but ladies and gentlemen what

1134.4 --> 1140.3090000000002
you see here is Apple's corporate

1137.429 --> 1142.049
headquarters and it's a mirror image of

1140.309 --> 1145.74
a cross-section of the nucleus of a

1142.049 --> 1149.429
human egg except there's one thing

1145.74 --> 1153.23
missing it's this part right here

1149.429 --> 1156.21
that's the smooth endoplasmic reticulum

1153.23 --> 1159.21
that's the subcellular component of the

1156.21 --> 1162.72
human egg that runs the zona reaction in

1159.21 --> 1164.25
other words when you have a sperm hit

1162.72 --> 1165.419
that egg in a billionth of a second

1164.25 --> 1169.679
there's a flashing light that egg

1165.419 --> 1171.419
hardening one sperm gets in that egg and

1169.679 --> 1174.7800000000002
it's run by that piece of equipment

1171.419 --> 1176.6100000000001
right there and it just so happens on

1174.78 --> 1179.1299999999999
this documents amazing we brought this

1176.61 --> 1184.37
today that's prominence on page 7 in

1179.13 --> 1189.24
this document it talks about how

1184.37 --> 1193.11
non-thermal power levels of microwave

1189.24 --> 1199.409
radiation ethical changes to the smooth

1193.11 --> 1202.35
endoplasmic reticulum page 7 second

1199.409 --> 1206.0700000000002
paragraph so ladies and gentlemen what

1202.35 --> 1210.36
you're seeing right here is something

1206.07 --> 1214.6499999999999
that the devil himself has designed that

1210.36 --> 1216.0
is a satanic company with technology

1214.65 --> 1217.73
deployed in the laps of every

1216.0 --> 1221.25
school-aged child in the United States

1217.73 --> 1222.659
and they're basically putting it out

1221.25 --> 1225.62
there in the landscape architecture

1222.659 --> 1225.6200000000001
plans what they're doing

1226.0 --> 1231.49
that's evil do these people know what

1228.7 --> 1234.04
they're doing I don't know if they you

1231.49 --> 1238.72
that's really scary but what matters is

1234.04 --> 1240.82
that they're doing it there's that

1238.72 --> 1243.46
subcellular component again I want to

1240.82 --> 1245.02
show you there's a couple more things

1243.46 --> 1247.81
that really bothered me here this is

1245.02 --> 1251.23
another slide of a human egg on the

1247.81 --> 1252.8799999999999
biology textbook and that's Apple's

1251.23 --> 1254.08
corporate headquarters landscape

1252.88 --> 1256.5700000000002
architecture planner

1254.08 --> 1259.27
all right so if I was in Vegas right now

1256.57 --> 1261.49
and I had put my life savings on boxcars

1259.27 --> 1263.2
I probably walking out with a billion

1261.49 --> 1266.95
dollars because I just did it three

1263.2 --> 1269.53
times those odds are crazy what in the

1266.95 --> 1273.43
world are these people thinking what is

1269.53 --> 1275.74
that why do they have pictures of cross

1273.43 --> 1278.3500000000001
sections of the given a in their

1275.74 --> 1280.54
landscape architecture plans when I've

1278.35 --> 1282.3999999999999
got this report from the military for

1280.54 --> 1284.83
forty years ago that says that these

1282.4 --> 1286.51
microwaves mess up that part of the cell

1284.83 --> 1289.9299999999998
is it an accident

1286.51 --> 1291.55
no because we import students with 180

1289.93 --> 1293.77
IQs and giving financial aid the

1291.55 --> 1295.6599999999999
scholarships and free bed and breakfast

1293.77 --> 1297.22
for five years and given PhDs and put

1295.66 --> 1300.0600000000002
them to look at these think tanks to

1297.22 --> 1300.06
make this crap

1304.3 --> 1311.77
anybody in this room familiar with

1306.6 --> 1317.59
mythology Artemis was a goddess of

1311.77 --> 1319.87
fertility this company was started by

1317.59 --> 1321.8799999999999
gentleman named Steve Karlin and he was

1319.87 --> 1324.61
an offshoot of African technology he was

1321.88 --> 1326.0500000000002
a chief scientist for Apple so what does

1324.61 --> 1327.28
he do he goes out hangs his own shingle

1326.05 --> 1330.25
and starts his own company called

1327.28 --> 1331.72
Artemis now if I was going to make some

1330.25 --> 1334.0
sort of wireless company maybe I would

1331.72 --> 1336.46
call it like you know spot on Wireless

1334.0 --> 1339.7
or broadcast banners no they call it the

1336.46 --> 1341.3500000000001
goddess of fertility Artemis that's what

1339.7 --> 1343.0900000000001
their devices look like it's an amazing

1341.35 --> 1346.12
it's an amazing device these are going

1343.09 --> 1351.31
to be everywhere micro cells are coming

1346.12 --> 1353.3799999999999
and because of assembly bill assembly

1351.31 --> 1355.36
bills and Senate bills in the state

1353.38 --> 1357.3100000000002
legislature the local municipalities

1355.36 --> 1359.83
will not have any say-so and where

1357.31 --> 1362.9199999999998
they're going to go and that's all based

1359.83 --> 1365.05
on erroneous illegal interpretation from

1362.92 --> 1367.42
a San Diego appeals court of the telecom

1365.05 --> 1368.68
act ladies and gentlemen you can't fight

1367.42 --> 1370.3600000000001
the deployment of these your city

1368.68 --> 1372.13
attorneys are ladies and cowards if they

1370.36 --> 1373.6899999999998
won't fight it that's a whole nother

1372.13 --> 1375.25
discussion but they're going to put

1373.69 --> 1376.93
these things in front of your house on

1375.25 --> 1379.57
your telephone poles on your light poles

1376.93 --> 1380.8600000000001
and on all the public rider waves and

1379.57 --> 1381.07
there's going to be any of you do about

1380.86 --> 1383.9199999999998
it

1381.07 --> 1385.57
if you let your si open up these things

1383.92 --> 1387.64
for the highest bidder they're coming

1385.57 --> 1392.73
and by the way the logo they're going to

1387.64 --> 1392.73
have on them is this inverted uterus

1393.75 --> 1398.19
this is all right in front of your face

1395.64 --> 1400.74
ladies and gentlemen I'm sitting up here

1398.19 --> 1403.14
with some eternal truth that was written

1400.74 --> 1405.39
thousands of years ago nothing's changed

1403.14 --> 1407.25
in here and I'm standing here and

1405.39 --> 1409.89
looking at the products of people to

1407.25 --> 1411.36
disobey that and now we're looking at

1409.89 --> 1415.65
the people that rejoice in its

1411.36 --> 1420.2099999999998
disobedience do you see a problem here

1415.65 --> 1423.69
folks now if I put my life savings on

1420.21 --> 1426.27
boxcars at the craps table I'd have

1423.69 --> 1430.0800000000002
enough money to buy the Bellagio and the

1426.27 --> 1432.9
Wynn and the Mirage and all the way up

1430.08 --> 1438.21
to the Golden Nugget by now what are the

1432.9 --> 1442.25
odds of this what are the odds this is

1438.21 --> 1442.25
not a coincidence ladies and gentlemen

1442.61 --> 1449.79
Artemis is also the goddess of the hunt

1446.57 --> 1455.1
let me explain to you what beamforming

1449.79 --> 1459.42
technology does what it does is it locks

1455.1 --> 1461.82
onto your device and it forms a little

1459.42 --> 1463.8000000000002
piece cell around it and it hones in on

1461.82 --> 1465.57
you almost like you're stuck in a laser

1463.8 --> 1467.46
scope with a sniper aiming at you the

1465.57 --> 1470.27
whole time where do we keep these

1467.46 --> 1473.43
devices in our pockets and our breasts

1470.27 --> 1482.03
what the kids keep these devices in

1473.43 --> 1482.03
their labs so now we have beamforming

1482.09 --> 1485.09
systems

1487.28 --> 1494.3
aimed at the eggs for figuring out ways

1491.51 --> 1498.67
to mess with the subcellular components

1494.3 --> 1498.6699999999998
of cells 40 years ago with microwaves

1499.42 --> 1503.8100000000002
you need to listen to me to share this

1502.07 --> 1505.49
information because I'm telling you

1503.81 --> 1508.96
something you're not going to hear

1505.49 --> 1511.88
anywhere else I study these things

1508.96 --> 1515.63
because I know what they're up to and I

1511.88 --> 1517.5200000000002
love people I hate their evil wicked

1515.63 --> 1519.23
ways and I hate their sin but I love

1517.52 --> 1520.4
people because we're all created in the

1519.23 --> 1523.55
image of God we're all brothers and

1520.4 --> 1526.3100000000002
sisters and we all have a common purpose

1523.55 --> 1529.28
folks and that is to love each other and

1526.31 --> 1533.27
to help each other out and to inhabit

1529.28 --> 1535.49
eternity through the sacrifice that

1533.27 --> 1536.93
Jesus Christ made on that cross as he

1535.49 --> 1538.46
shed his blood for all of us we're all

1536.93 --> 1540.47
brothers and sisters in the Lord and

1538.46 --> 1542.69
we're supposed to know this but it's

1540.47 --> 1545.03
been hidden from us and instead were

1542.69 --> 1547.01
being fed lies or being taught to hate

1545.03 --> 1549.59
each other and were being divided and

1547.01 --> 1551.72
balkanized by that box that's killing

1549.59 --> 1554.4199999999998
you because everything on the television

1551.72 --> 1556.1000000000001
is divisive propaganda designed to get

1554.42 --> 1558.0800000000002
you and take pills meet the rock types

1556.1 --> 1560.36
of foods and spend all your money on a

1558.08 --> 1562.61
bunch of crap you don't need while they

1560.36 --> 1563.87
sit there and kill you with it while

1562.61 --> 1564.59
they sit there and kill you with these

1563.87 --> 1566.36
phones

1564.59 --> 1568.6999999999998
well they sit there and kill your kids

1566.36 --> 1570.08
with these video game systems and trust

1568.7 --> 1571.91
me and I know how addictive they're I

1570.08 --> 1575.26
have children and it's a struggle it's a

1571.91 --> 1577.13
battle you have to listen to me folks

1575.26 --> 1579.29
you've got to look at the color

1577.13 --> 1582.3500000000001
temperature of your lighting it must be

1579.29 --> 1584.27
2700 degrees Kelvin or lower go to the

1582.35 --> 1585.83
goodwill and buy some old lamps and get

1584.27 --> 1587.69

1594.98 --> 1600.83
that nice orange light do not watch

1597.59 --> 1602.51
television at night shut off actually

1600.83 --> 1605.78
the best thing you can do for television

1602.51 --> 1608.84
is to never to use it if you have to use

1605.78 --> 1611.12
it control what's on there but don't

1608.84 --> 1612.53
watch anything that gives off blue light

at night it's going to kill you

1612.53 --> 1616.73
make you sick and if you want your wife

1614.48 --> 1618.89
not to have breast cancer now you don't

1616.73 --> 1620.66

1618.89 --> 1622.67
to your wife or your partner then you

1620.66 --> 1624.5900000000001
better stop putting a laptop on top of

1622.67 --> 1625.97
your wee-wee and don't sit there and

1624.59 --> 1627.05
stare at blue light at night because

1625.97 --> 1629.03
you're going to end up at City of Hope

1627.05 --> 1630.59
with a seating plan your prostate and

I'm warning you that's what's going to

1630.59 --> 1636.32
happen you may not like my delivery but

1632.69 --> 1638.0

1636.32 --> 1639.6799999999998
as your children you want them to have

1638.0 --> 1642.83
testicular cancer tell them to get that

1639.68 --> 1644.9
Xbox wirele wireless gaming control out

1642.83 --> 1647.36
of their lap there's a reason why

1644.9 --> 1650.5300000000002
testicular cancer is taking off like a

1647.36 --> 1652.25
SpaceX rocket right now in young boys

1650.53 --> 1654.62
that's fact

1652.25 --> 1657.02
these wireless systems are destroying

1654.62 --> 1659.09
our children these wireless gaming

1657.02 --> 1661.18
systems are destroying our children's

1659.09 --> 1663.53
health these wireless gaming systems

1661.18 --> 1664.94
irradiated amid microwaves even when

1663.53 --> 1666.86
they're shut off you've got to unplug

1664.94 --> 1669.44
these things I'm telling you folks all

1666.86 --> 1671.27
this stuff is weaponry it's been put in

1669.44 --> 1673.55
everywhere and it is up to you to

1671.27 --> 1675.47
recognize it it's up to me to tell you

1673.55 --> 1677.18
how to recognize it and then subdue you

1675.47 --> 1679.19
to recognize it and it's up to you to

1677.18 --> 1682.43
get it out of your house and save your

1679.19 --> 1685.3400000000001
family I've been to too many funerals

1682.43 --> 1688.19
where people died in a way too young age

1685.34 --> 1689.99
and it wasn't from a car accident people

1688.19 --> 1693.53
that I know are dying of cancer in their

1689.99 --> 1695.78
30s that should not be happening these

1693.53 --> 1698.06
bodies are supposed to go to 100 if you

1695.78 --> 1700.07
take care now granted that's hard

1698.06 --> 1701.27
consider we can't do a lot of things we

1700.07 --> 1703.04
used to do a hundred years ago but the

1701.27 --> 1704.93
fact is we shouldn't be dropping dead of

1703.04 --> 1708.05
some bizarre thing hooked up to some

1704.93 --> 1710.24
chemo drip when we're 29 or 30 years old

1708.05 --> 1711.95
leaving behind the infant and it's

1710.24 --> 1716.0
happening and you want to know something

1711.95 --> 1721.25
it's all preventable you know why I'm

1716.0 --> 1723.95
mad because they made these devices so

1721.25 --> 1726.17
addictive and they make the programming

1723.95 --> 1728.3600000000001
so addictive that you have to come back

1726.17 --> 1730.16
for more and they have the episode one

1728.36 --> 1732.1699999999998
two and three and the sequel and all

1730.16 --> 1734.3400000000001

1734.34 --> 1738.299

1736.23 --> 1740.85

1740.85 --> 1744.87
the wireless microwave emissions I

1742.679 --> 1746.7
already talked about that that's a

1744.87 --> 1748.4699999999998
that's another part of this weaponry

1746.7 --> 1749.88
deployment I'm talking about the

1748.47 --> 1753.39
lighting right now folks

1749.88 --> 1757.23

1753.39 --> 1759.929

1768.299 --> 1773.899
Achilles heel and it as simple as
