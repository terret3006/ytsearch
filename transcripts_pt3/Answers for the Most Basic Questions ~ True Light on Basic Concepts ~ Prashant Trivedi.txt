3.35 --> 13.339
and today I have an absolute honor and

7.97 --> 14.719
pleasure of inviting this rare and I'm

13.339 --> 16.85
gonna call him master even though he

14.719 --> 19.939
probably won't like that but real master

16.85 --> 22.73
of nakshatra and astrology please help

19.939 --> 25.490000000000002
me welcome bruster baby yeah I mean

22.73 --> 28.689
that's quite improved but the thing is

25.49 --> 28.689
that's not enough it's not

30.67 --> 37.09
so when I talk about Judas yeah notice

34.03 --> 39.43
to me is a part of this very broad

37.09 --> 40.78
learning which includes music like

39.43 --> 42.7
example you are wearing a pink toy

40.78 --> 44.56
teacher so you have heard rock and roll

42.7 --> 46.989000000000004
and hard side of the Moon yeah okay okay

44.56 --> 49.21
you're wearing that okay and now I have

46.989 --> 52.059
gone very deep into all the sound

49.21 --> 55.480000000000004
production devices like I play guitar I

52.059 --> 57.699999999999996
play electric guitar right so and I play

55.48 --> 60.519999999999996
with red city basically so because lips

57.7 --> 62.2
it can make los sounds like the amount

60.52 --> 63.760000000000005
of sounds you can make with city is much

62.2 --> 65.59
more than what you can make with any

63.76 --> 66.94
acoustic instrument mm-hmm you know

65.59 --> 69.04
because acoustic instruments will make

66.94 --> 70.69
the same metal jangling sound no matter

69.04 --> 72.19000000000001
what you have better it's a acoustic

70.69 --> 74.47
guitar or a sitar or you know whatever

72.19 --> 77.2
it is how bigger a thing it will not

74.47 --> 79.149
make certain kind of sounds no way can

77.2 --> 80.68
you make it make the amount of sounds

79.149 --> 82.63
which Alexa T makes there's a thing

80.68 --> 84.04
called tubes vacuum tubes I don't know

82.63 --> 85.75
if you know about them okay all the

84.04 --> 89.35000000000001
guitar amplifiers from 1930s onwards

85.75 --> 91.899
used vacuum tubes in 1960s 70s they were

89.35 --> 94.39
replaced by transistors because just to

91.899 --> 96.13
make things smaller yeah so earlier

94.39 --> 98.17
tubes now the tube the vacuum tube is

96.13 --> 99.61
the same thing as a television tube used

98.17 --> 102.61
to be which connects with the other side

99.61 --> 103.9
which I told you the CRT yeah yeah which

102.61 --> 105.42999999999999
was for connecting with the other side

103.9 --> 106.81
there's all things like Enochian

105.43 --> 109.119
language and stuff which the West came

106.81 --> 111.01
to know only by using crts and those

109.119 --> 113.77
other side entities actually stamped

111.01 --> 115.299
those symbols on that dream light so

113.77 --> 116.979
that's that's how they came to know even

115.299 --> 118.60000000000001
these language is Enochian language and

116.979 --> 120.78999999999999
things like that and correct me from

118.6 --> 124.05999999999999
wrong playing a flute or listening to

120.79 --> 126.61000000000001
flute increases your intuition maybe

124.06 --> 129.04
this sound will open up something in my

126.61 --> 132.04
damnit I believe much more in electric

129.04 --> 134.10999999999999
sounds then acoustic sounds okay yeah

132.04 --> 135.31
because it cities where everything is

134.11 --> 137.44000000000003
made of it should even your bar is made

135.31 --> 138.58
of Lake City yeah your brain synapses

137.44 --> 141.549
charges which are happening in your

138.58 --> 143.739
brain are electric it's all electric so

141.549 --> 147.04000000000002
we live in an electric universe not

143.739 --> 148.9
another thing you stick universe yeah

147.04 --> 150.34
it's electric universe now that the

148.9 --> 152.20000000000002
whole thing is like for example Pink

150.34 --> 153.19
Floyd and stuff now a lot of the music

152.2 --> 155.85999999999999
is very depressing

153.19 --> 157.35999999999999
yeah it is because they are in

155.86 --> 159.25
depression so Indian music will be

157.36 --> 160.78
depressing so all the frequencies which

159.25 --> 162.58
they're that thing they will bring their

160.78 --> 164.26
poor tamo-guna in it more they don't

162.58 --> 166.06
function by such cool so there

164.26 --> 167.95
honestly better mobile so they all that

166.06 --> 169.45
thing is much more there so in olicity

167.95 --> 171.069
also carries that thing so they don't I

169.45 --> 173.01899999999998
mean Pink Floyd people they have not

171.069 --> 174.189
researched sound properly so even they

173.019 --> 175.56900000000002
could operate a whatever sound he's

174.189 --> 177.76
using I won't consider that a good sound

175.569 --> 179.26
you know it was because that person

177.76 --> 181.78
doesn't know what they're doing yeah

179.26 --> 183.519
exactly you know they're just blindly

181.78 --> 184.93
playing something um saying they just

183.519 --> 186.64000000000001
plug into whatever amp they are given

184.93 --> 188.53
they don't look into what that amp is

186.64 --> 191.14
gonna produce what you does it have rice

188.53 --> 192.879
what is this thing I'm using exactly

191.14 --> 193.95899999999997
like they just playing something that's

192.879 --> 195.34
because they've been given that like

193.959 --> 196.75
that's a totally different things from

195.34 --> 198.4
knowing something when you know what

196.75 --> 200.019
you're doing like enjoy this also either

198.4 --> 201.159
you can know something you look at a

200.019 --> 202.72
chart you know what you're doing or you

201.159 --> 204.099
don't know or you can be like a doctor

202.72 --> 205.54
like the doctors which are all

204.099 --> 206.10899999999998
allopathic doctors if they don't know

205.54 --> 208.42
what they're doing

206.109 --> 209.34900000000002
no absolutely not yeah yet they don't

208.42 --> 212.04899999999998
know what they're doing they're just

209.349 --> 213.76
being told in the book they are just for

212.049 --> 215.709
the big companies foreign companies our

213.76 --> 217.48
company students that's it that's all

215.709 --> 219.73
they are as soon as you get something oh

217.48 --> 223.0
let me write your prescription oh my you

219.73 --> 226.629
you just took like 30 seconds to look at

223.0 --> 227.799
even a meter specialist if I or that you

226.629 --> 229.26899999999998
have to like you have to open your mind

227.799 --> 231.489
first you have understand what dr. means

229.269 --> 234.31
doctor is not a good word in English to

231.489 --> 236.59
dr. means to tamper with if you doctor

234.31 --> 238.359
it off document what does that mean - if

236.59 --> 240.04
you doctor a document that means you

238.359 --> 243.84900000000002
have tampered with em with it

240.04 --> 246.4
yeah it's a it's a legal thing so dr.

243.849 --> 247.72
something is illegal do you think so

246.4 --> 252.28
they doctoring with the human body

247.72 --> 253.419
itself and it's so true yeah yes so you

252.28 --> 254.919
have to understand what that mean

253.419 --> 255.519
meaning of that word means even in the

254.919 --> 257.139
first place

255.519 --> 259.18
they PO you that thing go to word after

257.139 --> 261.54900000000004
like for me like Joe this was an

259.18 --> 262.93
eye-opening experience because it

261.549 --> 265.83
connected me to the basic roots of

262.93 --> 269.05
things you know like for me it was a

265.83 --> 272.229
holistic thing not something where I do

269.05 --> 273.97
to make money to do readings or you know

272.229 --> 275.85999999999996
like people don't know profession I've

273.97 --> 277.449
never had it as my profession so so

275.86 --> 279.61
people donate into a dad thing you know

277.449 --> 281.08
for making money or that thing if you

279.61 --> 282.22
turn it into that kind of thing then

281.08 --> 284.32
it's obviously you are not very serious

282.22 --> 286.63000000000005
about it in the first place like you are

284.32 --> 288.46
not questing for knowledge whatever your

286.63 --> 290.56
audience is hearing like I just want to

288.46 --> 292.539
get through to them that Jewish is not

290.56 --> 294.9
something separated from all other

292.539 --> 298.18
Sciences it is very very connected to

294.9 --> 300.46
language etymology sounds Moo

298.18 --> 302.59000000000003
like mathematics everything and whenever

300.46 --> 304.15
people thoughts anything people right

302.59 --> 306.34
now I want to learn Jewish and stuff and

304.15 --> 307.71999999999997
they are not even they are eating me for

306.34 --> 309.36999999999995
example you eating me

307.72 --> 310.81
I mean you can't learn anything you

309.37 --> 312.97
already in a very hearty domestic state

310.81 --> 316.12
yeah yeah you have to be vegetarian

312.97 --> 317.47
first yeah yeah yeah so you have to be

316.12 --> 318.97
vegetarian first and all of that kind of

317.47 --> 320.77000000000004
thing you know like you have to change

318.97 --> 322.47900000000004
your way like like when people used to

320.77 --> 324.15999999999997
go to gurukuls before in russia coats

322.479 --> 326.59
all reaches you should teach them for

324.16 --> 329.78900000000004
first five years was how did i speaks

326.59 --> 332.289
from the center of your mouth that's all

329.789 --> 333.90999999999997
so when they would say any slow core any

332.289 --> 335.44
word or anything they have to speak from

333.91 --> 336.90000000000003
the center of the mouth can't speak from

335.44 --> 340.36
the left side can't speak um right

336.9 --> 342.099
always be from the center that's all

340.36 --> 344.74
they were taught because if you don't

342.099 --> 347.979
center your body yeah you are in no

344.74 --> 350.289
position to learn anything learning only

347.979 --> 352.69
happens from the center that's where the

350.289 --> 354.43
your social not channel is in the body

352.69 --> 357.669
that's where the colony rises wrong yes

354.43 --> 358.87
yeah so if you are not always in the

357.669 --> 360.58
center if you're not speaking from the

358.87 --> 362.47
center your mouth is not moving from the

360.58 --> 364.10999999999996
center you know if you speak from an

362.47 --> 367.87
American accent with an American accent

364.11 --> 371.74
from the center because it is from the

367.87 --> 373.51
side it's 20 oh well it's an area slide

371.74 --> 375.01
you're always speaking from your side

373.51 --> 376.75
you're not speaking from the center of

375.01 --> 380.62
your mouth speaking in centre of your

376.75 --> 383.32
mouth what is it doing for it programs

380.62 --> 385.06
your brain to come to the center okay I

383.32 --> 387.34
see every time you speak your

385.06 --> 389.08
programming your brain yeah every time

387.34 --> 391.23999999999995
you speak so I told you it's a spell and

389.08 --> 393.19
any language programs please speak in

391.24 --> 395.289
Sanskrit Hindi Bangla sons Tamil or

393.19 --> 397.449
English or any language it will program

395.289 --> 399.729
your mind and if you don't speak for the

397.449 --> 400.63
center like your social now will stay

399.729 --> 403.599
very narrow

400.63 --> 405.13
it'll be like a you know a country road

403.599 --> 406.599
but if you want to make it into highway

405.13 --> 408.0
big highway you will have to bring

406.599 --> 410.65
yourself bring your body to the center

408.0 --> 412.599
so your body politic he'll always like

410.65 --> 413.83
when you have this thing in India like

412.599 --> 416.53
this mm-hmm

413.83 --> 420.07
that is for only bringing yourself into

416.53 --> 422.85999999999996
Center and bring into center that's on

420.07 --> 425.8
center Center center Center always you

422.86 --> 427.69
know never be savvy like a Sai D person

425.8 --> 429.19
means unreliable person in English

427.69 --> 432.159
language even the ID means that you are

429.19 --> 433.9
not reliable straight means

432.159 --> 435.639
it's straightforward one has to be

433.9 --> 436.96
straightforward yeah it's

435.639 --> 439.36
straightforward like always in the

436.96 --> 442.779
center you know these things are much

439.36 --> 445.569
more basics joe 'this comes later what

442.779 --> 447.189
you eating how you're speaking how are

445.569 --> 449.499
you holding your body all these things

447.189 --> 451.389
come first your basics come first these

449.499 --> 452.86
are all laws of the multiples you wanted

451.389 --> 454.33
to know you are asking me what are the

452.86 --> 456.34000000000003
laws and these are the Lord's these are

454.33 --> 460.12
laws you have to be in the set and they

456.34 --> 462.4
don't teach that in even in India they

460.12 --> 463.659
don't do that anymore India they have

462.4 --> 466.29999999999995
not done that for 5,000 years

463.659 --> 467.68
yeah even in India they have not done

466.3 --> 469.27000000000004
that for 5,000 years

467.68 --> 470.379
that's why India is at the bottom of the

469.27 --> 471.789
pile like India has no knowledge

470.379 --> 473.379
whatsoever now mm-hmm

471.789 --> 475.93
because they have totally left a Vedic

473.379 --> 478.21000000000004
things roots yeah and then they are

475.93 --> 480.759
trying to copy the West they are all

478.21 --> 483.00899999999996
becoming westernized in demonize though

480.759 --> 484.509
bestnice means you are you have a thirst

483.009 --> 486.49
for knowledge you going out to knowledge

484.509 --> 487.93
like India's all happened when India

486.49 --> 488.5
became a superpower society do you know

487.93 --> 491.77
about Japan

488.5 --> 493.81
no ok shishupal was a like the one who

491.77 --> 495.75899999999996
had the fight with krishna oh I see okay

493.81 --> 498.189
okay you know there was a character yes

495.759 --> 500.05
you Paul now what does she show me she

498.189 --> 502.839
means like a little bit little baby

500.05 --> 505.229
child child now the after okay power

502.839 --> 507.37
means the one who nurtures nurtures

505.229 --> 510.12899999999996
children so they are conscious reports

507.37 --> 513.699
and what was patient Gopal

510.129 --> 517.659
cool no special power oh go means your

513.699 --> 520.99
senses senses go and cow cows and senses

517.659 --> 522.699
two things so he takes care of those

520.99 --> 524.949
things he's just not a baby producing

522.699 --> 527.14
machine like Indians just produce babies

524.949 --> 528.699
then take care of them and that's all

527.14 --> 529.93
their life is and when you become a

528.699 --> 531.9699999999999
super you will not have any knowledge

529.93 --> 533.04
like even Rishi's whenever should show

531.97 --> 535.69
pulse

533.04 --> 537.0999999999999
Wendy she's had a child even they would

535.69 --> 538.3900000000001
send it to another machine they would

537.1 --> 539.7090000000001
never teach it himself when you have a

538.39 --> 541.18
child you never don't have a deal with

539.709 --> 543.31
it at all you should be totally

541.18 --> 544.75
indifferent to it and that takes a lot

543.31 --> 547.18
of high knowledge to detach yourself

544.75 --> 549.25
yeah that detachment has to be there

547.18 --> 551.89
yeah because that is bad for the child

549.25 --> 554.11
and both you it's bad for both of the

551.89 --> 558.01
child becomes dependent of you so it

554.11 --> 558.88
becomes a brat yeah you know and so

558.01 --> 561.79
India is full of brats

558.88 --> 563.829
that's why because people it doesn't

561.79 --> 564.9699999999999
take responsibility for itself India

563.829 --> 565.3599999999999
people stay dependent on their parents

564.97 --> 570.57
even

565.36 --> 570.57
at the age of 40 and 50 absolutely true

570.6 --> 573.37
yes

571.81 --> 576.43
so they're not they don't get off the

573.37 --> 578.41
infantile childhood at all like so they

576.43 --> 580.63
they are not grown up so then you can't

578.41 --> 581.74
learn anything you know and there's a

580.63 --> 584.2
difference between a kid and a child

581.74 --> 586.1800000000001
child means somebody which can learn kid

584.2 --> 587.7090000000001
means something which is a brat that

586.18 --> 590.38
point already

587.709 --> 593.3389999999999
so English has two words kid and child

590.38 --> 596.05
China they have a good father-son

593.339 --> 598.99
father-daughter relationship to Rishi's

596.05 --> 600.37
even and them don't have a Schmidt with

598.99 --> 602.0790000000001
them there's no relationship

600.37 --> 603.3100000000001
they basically is no relation to its

602.079 --> 605.41
just know that that is your father but

603.31 --> 607.63
there is no relationship they know that

605.41 --> 609.01
thing like like in India like that these

607.63 --> 610.36
kids can come to their parents and

609.01 --> 612.1
they're always on their legs and they

610.36 --> 614.019
are trying mummy mummy Papa Papa like

612.1 --> 615.339
that like I'll tell you it's something

614.019 --> 617.88
about this I'll tell you something about

615.339 --> 619.6
this first like houses are for the depth

617.88 --> 622.36
mother and the father

619.6 --> 624.7
oh yeah I mean I mean it can be sixth

622.36 --> 626.26
from fourth yeah the father can't be

624.7 --> 628.12
sixth from fourth s is not normal logic

626.26 --> 631.3
I know when they Bend this ninth in came

628.12 --> 633.07
like it is always 10th but you have to

631.3 --> 635.14
understand that mother and father don't

633.07 --> 636.49
mean anything invading things all basic

635.14 --> 637.87
stories like if you go to the prelude

636.49 --> 639.37
story you found that he went totally

637.87 --> 640.779
against his father his father was in

639.37 --> 642.85
Turkish ship whatever he's told him to

640.779 --> 643.51
do he never did anything but that was

642.85 --> 645.16
not a bad thing

643.51 --> 646.6
waited scriptures no way say that you

645.16 --> 648.01
should follow your parents or you should

646.6 --> 649.9590000000001
listen to your parents or you should

648.01 --> 650.98
listen to a single thing they say Vedic

649.959 --> 653.079
scriptures only say you have to listen

650.98 --> 654.82
to divine not your parent yeah parents

653.079 --> 656.38
are not important physical worldly

654.82 --> 657.94
parents are not important or they are

656.38 --> 660.22
nothing they are the people who have

657.94 --> 661.48
brought you into this world and who

660.22 --> 664.6600000000001
don't know what this world as themselves

661.48 --> 666.61
yes true count it ant can't take you all

664.66 --> 667.18
of it no they have been done you a

666.61 --> 669.4590000000001
disservice

667.18 --> 671.949
they have not done you any service by

669.459 --> 675.459
bringing you into this world and any

671.949 --> 677.38
animal can even create babies yeah it

675.459 --> 679.5699999999999
doesn't take special that thing to

677.38 --> 681.579
create an eye yeah even an animal can

679.57 --> 683.529
procreate no creation is not a special

681.579 --> 685.329
activity you know which anybody can do

683.529 --> 686.949
like so that that's the whole point like

685.329 --> 688.5699999999999
this whole thing that you don't owe

686.949 --> 689.709
anything to your parents first first

688.57 --> 692.5
thing the Indians have all these

689.709 --> 694.569
misconceptions in their brains the day

692.5 --> 696.55
around the world it's not just India

694.569 --> 699.1899999999999
yeah around the world we have this like

696.55 --> 702.13
our parents are yeah you need to

699.19 --> 704.5600000000001
packed and mudichu no this integral but

702.13 --> 707.65
again this with the words there are two

704.56 --> 710.4399999999999
thing words older and elder yeah now

707.65 --> 712.06
older means older in age you age you

710.44 --> 713.71
know okay you don't respect somebody

712.06 --> 715.4499999999999
just because they're older to UNH

713.71 --> 718.33
yeah you only respect somebody because

715.45 --> 721.47
somebody is elder to you elder means en

718.33 --> 724.87
de are el means their kundalini has

721.47 --> 726.13
awakened and they won't pass all the

724.87 --> 727.87
chakras and they go on up there and

726.13 --> 731.23
that's why you respect them that's an

727.87 --> 734.89
elder that age can be 2025 any sixteen

731.23 --> 737.11
any age thirty forty any age so I mean

734.89 --> 740.71
Vedic stories are very clear about who

737.11 --> 742.9
to respect these are laws I mean if

740.71 --> 744.94
anybody in this age for example right

742.9 --> 746.62
now goes by their parents they'll go in

744.94 --> 748.09
a totally wrong line I mean I didn't

746.62 --> 750.79
notice because my parents wanted me to

748.09 --> 753.58
and now got it your enthusiasm to

750.79 --> 755.62
learning jokes this game how no because

753.58 --> 755.9200000000001
the point is like you want to know where

755.62 --> 759.13
you are

755.92 --> 761.0799999999999
yeah when you are baby yeah when you are

759.13 --> 762.87
three years old four years old when you

761.08 --> 765.0400000000001
first come to know that you are being

762.87 --> 767.44
you know when you first start to come to

765.04 --> 770.29
know that you are a B then you come to

767.44 --> 771.6300000000001
know okay am something you know you have

770.29 --> 774.1899999999999
a consciousness which is not your name

771.63 --> 775.15
it's nothing wrong with your name you

774.19 --> 776.5600000000001
just know that you're something whether

775.15 --> 778.3
you have a name or not you don't have a

776.56 --> 779.7099999999999
name it does not matter because you not

778.3 --> 781.87
your name you know your name can be

779.71 --> 783.6700000000001
anything at any time you still exist

781.87 --> 785.7
yeah right norm your name is camilo

783.67 --> 788.17
system or it can be Sudan - it can be

785.7 --> 789.94
Siddharth it can be anything you will

788.17 --> 791.9799999999999
still exist your name might become

789.94 --> 794.86
anything or you might not have any amuse

791.98 --> 796.87
you will still exist you not cease to

794.86 --> 798.94
exist so when you are three years old

796.87 --> 800.2
four years old your memory starts you

798.94 --> 801.94
come to know that you're a being and

800.2 --> 803.0200000000001
when you come through your being you

801.94 --> 804.46
come to know that you are inside

803.02 --> 806.41
something this big big thing you look

804.46 --> 809.14
outside you go out and you see the sky

806.41 --> 811.3
yeah you are inside some huge something

809.14 --> 812.68
like you want inside something then you

811.3 --> 813.9399999999999
come to know that you are a being and

812.68 --> 815.67
you were inside something and

813.94 --> 818.1700000000001
automatically the next question Rises

815.67 --> 820.54
what is this thing yeah what is this

818.17 --> 821.62
thing what is this thing and then when

820.54 --> 822.6999999999999
you come in with what is this thing then

821.62 --> 823.99
you come to know what are the laws of

822.7 --> 825.7900000000001
this is what is the basis of this thing

823.99 --> 827.95
that's when Jewish comes in

825.79 --> 831.04
to help you understand what this thing

827.95 --> 832.57
is you're inside a field you are inside

831.04 --> 833.059
a feeling to you the scientific term you

832.57 --> 836.149
inside of

833.059 --> 838.0989999999999
no nakshatras also 27 types of fields

836.149 --> 841.309
that's all so I don't know about those

838.099 --> 842.9190000000001
fields or you don't right yeah joe 'this

841.309 --> 846.259
is as part of understanding this whole

842.919 --> 848.629
thing you're inside and what its laws

846.259 --> 850.399
are but I wanted to know those even

848.629 --> 852.559
before earlier I even at age of seven

850.399 --> 856.099
eight nine ten eleven I always wanted to

852.559 --> 858.079
go those Wow is it because you cannot

856.099 --> 860.749
grew up in there vedic environment or

858.079 --> 861.4989999999999
you transoid do this no no no no it's

860.749 --> 866.029
because i didn't have a relationship

861.499 --> 868.5790000000001
with my appearance oh the most favorable

866.029 --> 872.179
thing for me was that i was not attached

868.579 --> 874.3389999999999
to my parents due to some reason or just

872.179 --> 876.049
naturally weren't necessarily I wasn't

874.339 --> 877.759
attached like I didn't have this my

876.049 --> 880.009
mommy my papa

877.759 --> 882.1990000000001
this is my daddy this is my mom like I

880.009 --> 882.799
didn't have this my my thing that this

882.199 --> 885.139
is mine

882.799 --> 887.059
that's where people get caught I mean

885.139 --> 889.449
that is another being you are a being

887.059 --> 892.4889999999999
and that is a being that is not yours

889.449 --> 894.9989999999999
it's a separate being it's separate from

892.489 --> 898.129
you you don't have ownership over it

894.999 --> 899.899
yeah so when you decimal territory you

898.129 --> 901.549
require you should have this bad

899.899 --> 904.669
mentality which is very bad for you

901.549 --> 906.949
which is like my thing my brother my

904.669 --> 911.119
father my sister my this thing my dad

906.949 --> 912.769
what this is not yours or all of this is

911.119 --> 914.599
not yours and that's what creates a

912.769 --> 915.919
black so it's my father then I can ask

914.599 --> 918.9190000000001
them for anything it's my mother I can

915.919 --> 920.239
ask him for anything if I want if I want

918.919 --> 922.039
to talk to I go mommy mommy give me a

920.239 --> 923.719
talkie like him say so worried when you

922.039 --> 925.789
wanted something what did you do did you

923.719 --> 929.0590000000001
I didn't want anything a bit the point

925.789 --> 929.869
is you are confused first when you come

929.059 --> 932.149
into this world you're absolutely

929.869 --> 934.549
confused confused yeah yeah you're in a

932.149 --> 936.109
confused state of utter confusion you

934.549 --> 937.759
know because like even when Grandma

936.109 --> 939.5590000000001
first came into being the one who

937.759 --> 941.809
created the brahman he first came into

939.559 --> 944.389
being he didn't know who he was or where

941.809 --> 947.9889999999999
he was so you have to go into meditation

944.389 --> 950.599
first to even figure out who you are and

947.989 --> 952.369
where you are and what is all this even

950.599 --> 955.369
rum have to do that but beings right now

952.369 --> 956.869
don't do this at all even Brahma who is

955.369 --> 958.399
much more powerful much more stronger

956.869 --> 960.669
much more that thing than you had to do

958.399 --> 964.039
that then who are you

960.669 --> 965.749
what I mean beings just jump into action

964.039 --> 966.83
in this world you don't jump into action

965.749 --> 968.45
you

966.83 --> 969.86
you try and figure things out what is

968.45 --> 970.7
this what is all this where am I like

969.86 --> 972.13
you were just in a state of confusion

970.7 --> 974.87
last thing you can do is want something

972.13 --> 977.24
exactly when you are in state of cut you

974.87 --> 979.43
you are feeling like that nothing is

977.24 --> 980.99
clear for example if you suddenly right

979.43 --> 983.78
now you're sitting here in this year and

980.99 --> 984.29
next 30 seconds you end up in another

983.78 --> 987.77
planet

984.29 --> 988.5799999999999
then you would be confused yeah would be

987.77 --> 991.0699999999999
like where am I

988.58 --> 992.6600000000001
what is the oldest and you don't start

991.07 --> 994.61
eating something because if you read

992.66 --> 995.48
something it might be poisonous you

994.61 --> 997.5500000000001
don't know what that thing is

995.48 --> 999.35
yeah you you don't know where you are

997.55 --> 1001.0899999999999
you can't just go there you see a fruit

999.35 --> 1003.16
and you just put it into your mouth you

1001.09 --> 1004.1700000000001
can't do that yeah you'll have to figure

1003.16 --> 1006.79
it out isn't it first

1004.17 --> 1008.2299999999999
where you are and when people try to

1006.79 --> 1011.65
figure that out they'd only figure out

1008.23 --> 1013.54
society society and whatever the junk

1011.65 --> 1014.7099999999999
that it feeds you you know the whole

1013.54 --> 1016.36
point is August like when you're going

1014.71 --> 1018.37
into all this thing like you have to

1016.36 --> 1019.66
first figure something out first way you

1018.37 --> 1021.3100000000001
are act you know

1019.66 --> 1023.8299999999999
and for that you can't have this

1021.31 --> 1025.4199999999998
reliance on preparing systems you know

1023.83 --> 1027.55
because parents don't know anything

1025.42 --> 1029.2
about it and you can't rely on society

1027.55 --> 1030.43
they're like when he was thinking first

1029.2 --> 1032.17
like you're a being and you were

1030.43 --> 1034.0600000000002
somewhere you should not think that I'm

1032.17 --> 1035.77
in India next somebody comes from you're

1034.06 --> 1039.1
like okay I'm in this village or I'm in

1035.77 --> 1040.06
New Delhi or I am in India that doesn't

1039.1 --> 1041.53
tell you that tells you where you are

1040.06 --> 1044.83
that doesn't tell you what you are

1041.53 --> 1046.66
inside merchants it just tells you where

1044.83 --> 1048.1599999999999
you are like but like being in any

1046.66 --> 1049.5700000000002
country or any village or any town like

1048.16 --> 1049.93
you can say I am in here I am here right

1049.57 --> 1051.28
now

1049.93 --> 1054.88
but that isn't that just gives your

1051.28 --> 1056.68
location which is man-made exactly but

1054.88 --> 1057.88
what is the earth below you exactly what

1056.68 --> 1059.8
is the way you were standing what is

1057.88 --> 1061.66
that what is below that earth where is

1059.8 --> 1063.55
that what is this you don't know

1061.66 --> 1065.2900000000002
anything about that you just given it a

1063.55 --> 1066.61
name using you just saying I'm sense and

1065.29 --> 1069.36
standing in New Delhi or India or

1066.61 --> 1071.83
America or anything is man-made names

1069.36 --> 1073.3
absolutely yeah there's nothing to do

1071.83 --> 1074.9499999999998
with what you were inside like right now

1073.3 --> 1076.51
you are inside something it's like a

1074.95 --> 1078.3700000000001
womb like you are inside your mother's

1076.51 --> 1080.92
womb you are inside the womb right now

1078.37 --> 1084.2199999999998
is where it's just very big exactly Wow

1080.92 --> 1086.74
yeah well what yeah yeah but but you

1084.22 --> 1088.6000000000001
have to feel that feeling first that you

1086.74 --> 1092.83
were inside something then only you all

1088.6 --> 1094.27
want to know what it is you know if you

1092.83 --> 1095.98
become a person like that the last thing

1094.27 --> 1096.7
you wouldn't talk to is your parents you

1095.98 --> 1098.59
will have nothing to do with your

1096.7 --> 1100.0800000000002
parents but wouldn't be a natural thing

1098.59 --> 1101.9099999999999
to ask him what is this all about

1100.08 --> 1103.59
because you will ask them once but

1101.91 --> 1106.8300000000002
they'll tell you they don't know it's

1103.59 --> 1108.09
true and the matter ain't yeah I didn't

1106.83 --> 1109.1699999999998
have to be a genius to tell what my

1108.09 --> 1110.82
father doesn't know anything even if I

1109.17 --> 1112.0800000000002
was went to school if I have a match

1110.82 --> 1113.6699999999998
thing my father didn't know that what

1112.08 --> 1116.1499999999999
that max was I mean there's no point

1113.67 --> 1119.04
asking in many people are confused about

1116.15 --> 1120.96
the original sharks no mom's what is

1119.04 --> 1123.48
navamsa we all started figuring around

1120.96 --> 1126.1200000000001
yeah but you figure out things basics

1123.48 --> 1128.28

1184.47 --> 1191.1000000000001
another talk yeah somebody wants to know

1187.17 --> 1192.9
just like a mundane level how strong

1191.1 --> 1195.2099999999998
some seasoned Imam she has not important

1192.9 --> 1196.38
some say it's important what is mundane

1195.21 --> 1197.73
level you have to understand there is no

1196.38 --> 1200.0400000000002
mundane level there is only one level

1197.73 --> 1201.57
one okay and at a spiritual level and

1200.04 --> 1204.51
that is the only level there is no other

1201.57 --> 1207.4199999999998
level like if you were here the level

1204.51 --> 1208.53
you were just a slave and all people who

1207.42 --> 1210.27
do nine-to-five jobs right now all

1208.53 --> 1211.8899999999999
slaves there is no difference between

1210.27 --> 1214.01
mundane and spiritual people should not

1211.89 --> 1217.2900000000002
make these kids off any and their brain

1214.01 --> 1218.37
this is schedule Fania all of this then

1217.29 --> 1219.72
there is mundane level there is

1218.37 --> 1222.03
spiritual level there is this thing all

1219.72 --> 1223.47
levels are exactly same or the same

1222.03 --> 1225.81
thing there you are never out of this

1223.47 --> 1227.79
you are inside one thing which is a

1225.81 --> 1229.62
complete whole you can't separate it out

1227.79 --> 1232.02
if you follow you do multiversal laws

1229.62 --> 1233.82
you will not have to follow the man-made

1232.02 --> 1236.609
laws just like

1233.82 --> 1237.869
when panade was praising vishnu Bunica

1236.609 --> 1239.999
she could not do anything to him he

1237.869 --> 1242.759
tried everything he threw everything at

1239.999 --> 1244.109
him nothing happened to him because my

1242.759 --> 1245.82
dad is going as per the laws of the

1244.109 --> 1250.379
multiverse when you go as for the laws

1245.82 --> 1253.979
of multiverse you are invincible nobody

1250.379 --> 1256.639
can harm you nothing in on you from

1253.979 --> 1256.6390000000001
