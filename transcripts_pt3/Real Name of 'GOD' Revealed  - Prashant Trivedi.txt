7.04 --> 10.16
yes

7.359 --> 12.48
welcome uh so today we have with us

10.16 --> 13.44
russian tribal guru for now an expert in

12.48 --> 15.200000000000001
vedic knowledge

13.44 --> 17.279
and so i would like to discuss with you

15.2 --> 18.24
the topic of definitions of the terms

17.279 --> 21.039
divine

18.24 --> 22.64
and god as there are many concepts and

21.039 --> 24.880000000000003
misconceptions

22.64 --> 27.68
some like correct brother and say that

24.88 --> 30.4
god is not of any form but is a process

27.68 --> 31.358999999999998
other in iskcon based on bhagavad-gita

30.4 --> 33.68
says that krishna

31.359 --> 35.92
is the supreme personality of god as

33.68 --> 37.6
christian bhagavad-gita says

35.92 --> 40.079
it should be understood that all species

37.6 --> 41.92
of life a son of quantity are made

40.079 --> 42.8
possible by birth in this material

41.92 --> 45.440000000000005
nature

42.8 --> 46.64
and that i'm the seed giving father and

45.44 --> 49.76
so the question would be

46.64 --> 51.199
if is god a person what and or who is

49.76 --> 54.48
divine so you could maybe

51.199 --> 57.199
give us some clarity on the topic okay

54.48 --> 58.0
okay oscar the thing is everything

57.199 --> 60.32
starts with words

58.0 --> 61.84
right like so god is an english word

60.32 --> 64.64
what is the language now

61.84 --> 66.08
known as english okay so now there are a

64.64 --> 68.159
lot of gods

66.08 --> 69.92
you know it's not god is not a singular

68.159 --> 70.799
term in english because there are many

69.92 --> 72.96000000000001
gods you know

70.799 --> 74.32000000000001
so like islam people will have their own

72.96 --> 75.91999999999999
god definition

74.32 --> 77.91999999999999
and judaic people will have their own

75.92 --> 79.92
definition of their god and

77.92 --> 81.68
then there is a christian god which has

79.92 --> 84.72
certain characteristics and

81.68 --> 87.2
then like you said iscon has their own

84.72 --> 88.32
definition of that term so this term is

87.2 --> 89.84
a very vague term

88.32 --> 93.91999999999999
i would consider a very vague term can

89.84 --> 96.159
be used in many ways and a lot of times

93.92 --> 99.28
the god out there is gender based you

96.159 --> 101.92
know like it can be a male god

99.28 --> 103.68
or a female goddess when it's then it's

101.92 --> 106.72
called goddess okay

103.68 --> 107.60000000000001
just okay so it is a term which is very

106.72 --> 110.64
vague

107.6 --> 112.79899999999999
you know and sometimes if it's used as a

110.64 --> 114.56
thing like generator operator destroyer

112.799 --> 116.96000000000001
which is also like given later

114.56 --> 118.71900000000001
you know it was not the original intent

116.96 --> 120.479
so original intent was to create the

118.719 --> 121.19999999999999
vagueness and that weakness has spread

120.479 --> 123.28
around the world

121.2 --> 124.88000000000001
and that was its purpose to make this

123.28 --> 128.239
time

124.88 --> 130.399
divine is slightly more scientific term

128.239 --> 133.04
compared to god because at least it

130.399 --> 135.12
talks about diverse wine means branching

133.04 --> 136.16
but i was branching but it hides the

135.12 --> 137.44
fire ratio part

136.16 --> 139.44
you know diverse branching and fire

137.44 --> 140.72
ratio okay the golden ratio but it hides

139.44 --> 141.76
because you can't get that from the word

140.72 --> 145.44
divine okay

141.76 --> 147.12
there's no i in it okay now again

145.44 --> 148.8
we are in an english language still we

147.12 --> 149.84
are in that language and i'm sure a lot

148.8 --> 153.68
of other languages have

149.84 --> 157.36
different terms for the same concept

153.68 --> 158.4
okay so i would like to go back to a

157.36 --> 160.0
root

158.4 --> 162.0
like terminology in a root language

160.0 --> 165.76
called sanskrit okay

162.0 --> 171.84
now sanskrit uh the term

165.76 --> 171.84
for the same thing is paramatma

172.56 --> 176.319
you can find it in all sanskrit texts

175.12 --> 180.959
okay you can find it

176.319 --> 180.95899999999997
even in text which is gone

181.12 --> 185.12
talking about okay this paramatma word

195.68 --> 203.28
yes okay so which is now called spirit

200.239 --> 206.4
in english like okay spirit okay so

203.28 --> 209.84
atma and the

206.4 --> 213.20000000000002
atma is not the same in everyone okay

209.84 --> 213.68
it has levels so so atma has got levels

213.2 --> 216.07999999999998
so

213.68 --> 217.84
atma has levels like uh these beings

216.08 --> 219.20000000000002
atma can be at this level of coherence

217.84 --> 222.159
another big satmar can be

219.2 --> 224.07999999999998
another level of koreans okay so there

222.159 --> 226.79899999999998
are different things like jivatma

224.08 --> 226.799
mahatma

228.0 --> 232.08
okay there are various levels and

230.72 --> 235.2
hierarchies

232.08 --> 238.08
within the atma concept okay

235.2 --> 238.83999999999997
okay and at the top of this hierarchy at

238.08 --> 243.68
the very top

238.84 --> 247.68
is param atma which means supreme

243.68 --> 249.68
atmas the supreme being the supreme self

247.68 --> 251.20000000000002
okay which i find is the most

249.68 --> 254.08
unambiguous

251.2 --> 254.95899999999997
definition it's very clear and it is not

254.08 --> 258.16
neither male nor

254.959 --> 262.96
nor female it has no gender yeah

258.16 --> 266.32000000000005
okay so first gender issue finishes

262.96 --> 268.96
there's no gender issue now

266.32 --> 269.44
it is a very specific term okay very

268.96 --> 273.28
clear

269.44 --> 276.56
so it takes away all of this fiasco

273.28 --> 280.08
you know any other name yeah

276.56 --> 283.199
it takes it away it just is this okay

280.08 --> 285.03999999999996
so the supreme spirit the supreme being

283.199 --> 288.40000000000003
or the supreme that thing is always

285.04 --> 288.8
has a term called yeah which is not

288.4 --> 292.56
there

288.8 --> 294.88
in english there is no english

292.56 --> 296.08
version of paramatma because the atma

294.88 --> 297.84
concept is not there

296.08 --> 299.12
no don't have the atma concept first to

297.84 --> 303.039
have a paramatma

299.12 --> 305.68
yeah okay okay so so the whole thing is

303.039 --> 307.36
um lost in languages actually the whole

305.68 --> 309.52
problem comes from language

307.36 --> 311.199
okay when you use a root language like

309.52 --> 313.12
sanskrit then use paramatma

311.199 --> 314.24
do you say because the word krishna for

313.12 --> 316.88
example

314.24 --> 318.8
okay comes from uh krishna has meanings

316.88 --> 321.28
in sanskrit like dark cute

318.8 --> 322.639
you know dark colored you know true with

321.28 --> 324.71999999999997
krishi agriculture

322.639 --> 326.56
there are different root terms

324.72 --> 327.6
agriculture dark alert like these kind

326.56 --> 329.919
of things you know so

327.6 --> 331.36
it is related to a particular aspect of

329.919 --> 335.44
nature and creation

331.36 --> 338.47900000000004
yeah not everything okay

335.44 --> 339.12
okay so the only thing which is

338.479 --> 343.28
everything

339.12 --> 343.28000000000003
in sanskrit in any vedic text

343.52 --> 347.68
there is no other terminology which can

346.0 --> 351.36
be given now that paramatma

347.68 --> 354.8
can be

351.36 --> 356.88
like obviously take a form anywhere in

354.8 --> 359.919
any plane of existence

356.88 --> 362.71999999999997
okay it's a being just like

359.919 --> 364.639
you are a atma and now right now you

362.72 --> 366.319
have this physical body

364.639 --> 368.24
and you call yourself your name is oscar

366.319 --> 371.84000000000003
right now

368.24 --> 374.24
so you have also taken a form here

371.84 --> 375.28
on this particular plane called earth

374.24 --> 378.88
right now

375.28 --> 378.88
so if atma can do it

378.96 --> 382.56
okay why why i can't tell not know

382.8 --> 386.639
okay it makes no sense that paramatma

385.28 --> 389.039
can't do it like you know so

386.639 --> 389.68
the same that things it has even more

389.039 --> 392.639
rights

389.68 --> 395.28000000000003
across the various plates of existence

392.639 --> 398.8
in the multiverse

395.28 --> 400.55999999999995
as atma has so so to

398.8 --> 402.639
say that it can't have form or it is

400.56 --> 406.4
formless only

402.639 --> 409.52
is unscientific okay even a fractal

406.4 --> 412.63899999999995
yeah has a form

409.52 --> 415.039
okay it's a fractal form yes so

412.639 --> 416.40000000000003
parmata means perfect fractal perfect

415.039 --> 419.44
coherence

416.4 --> 422.23999999999995
perfect the word perfect is

419.44 --> 423.199
relates to paramatma is like that only

422.24 --> 426.479
that word

423.199 --> 428.479
sanskrit yes it's like perfect

426.479 --> 429.919
and param means supreme too supreme

428.479 --> 431.28
perfect like these kind of

429.919 --> 433.35999999999996
connotations if you combine lot of

431.28 --> 436.88
english words you will get

433.36 --> 439.44
the param concept yeah okay

436.88 --> 440.8
so so that is the main thing like so

439.44 --> 445.36
it's a matter of terminology

440.8 --> 447.599
you know so so there are atmas

445.36 --> 448.639
various kinds various levels and there

447.599 --> 452.08
is karma

448.639 --> 454.319
that's it so that makes it very simple

452.08 --> 455.35999999999996
you know and instead of the god

454.319 --> 459.03900000000004
confusion

455.36 --> 461.28000000000003
yes which is a confusion yeah it does

459.039 --> 463.599
and more and a god's confusion than

461.28 --> 466.71999999999997
their demigods

463.599 --> 468.15999999999997
these okay and then there is a confusion

466.72 --> 470.0
with the term divine because

468.16 --> 471.59900000000005
though it was trying to be scientific it

470.0 --> 472.96
did not improve the phi ratio within the

471.599 --> 475.28
name

472.96 --> 477.44
but paramatma already has that perfect

475.28 --> 481.039
coherence and perfect fractality

477.44 --> 483.28
which is fine within it so that is more

481.039 --> 485.36
in that term so i would suggest using

483.28 --> 488.55999999999995
the sanskrit term

485.36 --> 491.199
okay for people with all languages

488.56 --> 493.199
no matter what to understand the concept

491.199 --> 494.479
to be clear about the concept

493.199 --> 497.68
and then there'll be no further

494.479 --> 501.039
confusion about different names

497.68 --> 502.96
which crop up you know for

501.039 --> 504.4
for that thing you know like so there'll

502.96 --> 506.56
be no confusion about

504.4 --> 508.15999999999997
this thing from this point on you know

506.56 --> 511.52
and the generation

508.16 --> 514.08
operation destruction parts the trigonum

511.52 --> 515.4399999999999
which are the three days in sanskrit you

514.08 --> 518.64
know like in vedic

515.44 --> 521.44
is brahma vishnu and shiv you know

518.64 --> 523.519
genetics brahma operators vishnu and

521.44 --> 526.8800000000001
destroyers

523.519 --> 529.2
which are the three branches of the

526.88 --> 529.2
burma

529.36 --> 535.76
the one becomes three like

532.48 --> 538.32
yes in order for the creation yeah

535.76 --> 539.4399999999999
to be working like you know for the

538.32 --> 541.2
patient to work that

539.44 --> 542.8800000000001
one has to become three just like the

541.2 --> 543.36
number one also becomes three like you

542.88 --> 545.4399999999999
know two

543.36 --> 547.6800000000001
three like that like the more you go to

545.44 --> 549.2790000000001
the vedic real thing

547.68 --> 551.8389999999999
you'll find that this is all very very

549.279 --> 553.4399999999999
clear and there's no shadow of doubt in

551.839 --> 555.9200000000001
any of these things and the modern words

553.44 --> 555.9200000000001
like god

556.08 --> 559.44
and everybody has made their own god

558.08 --> 562.24
yeah

559.44 --> 562.8800000000001
so that has created confusion you know

562.24 --> 564.32
you can make

562.88 --> 568.08
whatever but paramatma will remain the

564.32 --> 570.1600000000001
same does not matter what you make

568.08 --> 571.2
you can start you can keep on making

570.16 --> 574.0799999999999
whatever you know

571.2 --> 574.8000000000001
you know and if some people have said

574.08 --> 576.8000000000001
chosen then

574.8 --> 578.16
name christian to call it by i don't

576.8 --> 579.519
know why they don't call it burma

578.16 --> 581.68
because even christian will have no

579.519 --> 586.48
problems

581.68 --> 589.5999999999999
yeah okay yeah right

586.48 --> 591.36
if they so choose you know to do that

589.6 --> 594.0
it's up to them all this i think just

591.36 --> 596.88
creates more confusion

594.0 --> 598.88
and craziness and the point that all

596.88 --> 601.92
atmos are not equal

598.88 --> 602.56
and there's a difference in the levels

601.92 --> 604.7199999999999
of spirit

602.56 --> 606.079
which beings have the level of atma it's

604.72 --> 607.36
a very important concept

606.079 --> 610.0
that's the most important concept to

607.36 --> 613.92
learn out there you know because

610.0 --> 617.44
that gives you scope for evolution yes

613.92 --> 618.959
if everyone's atma was the same

617.44 --> 620.24
and of the same power and the same

618.959 --> 621.4399999999999
everything the same tactile the same

620.24 --> 623.6
core and same everything then

621.44 --> 625.36
where is the scope for evolution well

623.6 --> 627.519
there is no place for it

625.36 --> 628.8000000000001
but there's no place there's no space

627.519 --> 632.0
for it okay

628.8 --> 634.079
then if everybody was paramatma

632.0 --> 636.24
if everyone was paramagma then there is

634.079 --> 638.4799999999999
no point to do anything because you're

636.24 --> 640.5600000000001
already there

638.48 --> 642.399
you have already reached the highest

640.56 --> 644.64
possible state of being in the

642.399 --> 647.6
multiverse

644.64 --> 648.3199999999999
okay yeah so but that is not the case

647.6 --> 649.76
you know

648.32 --> 651.519
beings realize even in their day-to-day

649.76 --> 653.68
life that they are not much in control

651.519 --> 657.04
of anything

653.68 --> 657.68
you know let alone the whole thing you

657.04 --> 661.12
know

657.68 --> 662.8
so the more beings are in reality this

661.12 --> 664.5600000000001
concept brings you to reality that even

662.8 --> 669.12
at the deepest downward the core

664.56 --> 671.5999999999999
level of your being you have limitations

669.12 --> 672.399
yeah unlike the new age concept of

671.6 --> 675.0400000000001
unlimited

672.399 --> 676.24
and according to new age principles your

675.04 --> 677.8389999999999
internal that thing

676.24 --> 680.0790000000001
being the self the core self is

677.839 --> 682.0
unlimited

680.079 --> 683.279
what the vedic is saying that even that

682.0 --> 686.399
atman is

683.279 --> 689.8389999999999
limited yeah even though it does not die

686.399 --> 692.56
when you die it

689.839 --> 693.6800000000001
takes another body and you know and its

692.56 --> 697.1999999999999
bodies can change but

693.68 --> 698.7199999999999
it is not unlimited yeah

697.2 --> 700.24
they even say that they are like two

698.72 --> 702.64
atmas in the heart

700.24 --> 703.44
so there's the jiva the atma and then

702.64 --> 706.88
there is this

703.44 --> 709.519
part of super atm of

706.88 --> 711.04
actually so they call it guru so they

709.519 --> 712.5600000000001
have the concept that they are like two

711.04 --> 715.279
art master

712.56 --> 716.959
yes yeah that is i only say that in the

715.279 --> 720.399
vedic there's only one

716.959 --> 722.88
okay and that atma since

720.399 --> 724.399
it's also a fractal yeah will always be

722.88 --> 725.2
connected to the bigger factory which is

724.399 --> 727.2
permanent

725.2 --> 728.48
yeah there will always be a connection

727.2 --> 730.72
between atm and

728.48 --> 730.72
okay

735.2 --> 739.0400000000001
yeah for you to have that connection

737.12 --> 741.2
okay

739.04 --> 742.399
just a term automatically creates a

741.2 --> 745.519
connection even because the

742.399 --> 745.92
paramatma has atma yes okay and atma so

745.519 --> 747.76
the

745.92 --> 749.5999999999999
word itself has connection but doesn't

747.76 --> 751.4399999999999
mean that it has to sit right there

749.6 --> 752.639
if that was the case again no need for

751.44 --> 755.7600000000001
evolution

752.639 --> 758.9590000000001
yes exactly so it's already there

755.76 --> 760.639
it's only there so again it takes away

758.959 --> 763.92
all need for evolution once more

760.639 --> 765.92
yeah so uh i mean uh if that was the

763.92 --> 767.04
case then arjun never needed to ask any

765.92 --> 769.4399999999999
question to a question

767.04 --> 770.3199999999999
yes exactly because he had this sitting

769.44 --> 773.6800000000001
inside him

770.32 --> 777.44
yeah he could just ask to him exactly

773.68 --> 778.3199999999999
inside yes so we wouldn't have any

777.44 --> 780.48
bhagavad-gita

778.32 --> 781.44
bhagavad-gita uh and we won't have any

780.48 --> 785.12
of these things

781.44 --> 788.32
or any of that necessary so again

785.12 --> 790.48
this is just another sort of myth

788.32 --> 792.0
which has been propagated illogical just

790.48 --> 793.2
to misguide people i mean there are so

792.0 --> 794.8
many

793.2 --> 796.8000000000001
misconceptions which have been floating

794.8 --> 798.639
around yeah they're called part of

796.8 --> 801.76
darkness like age of ignorance

798.639 --> 803.2
yeah so and uh for that more nonsense

801.76 --> 806.639
has to be spewed

803.2 --> 809.279
in order to confuse matters more

806.639 --> 810.16
like atma is finally under paramatma

809.279 --> 814.0
that is

810.16 --> 818.7199999999999
clear but not within your

814.0 --> 821.36
being that's why beings have free will

818.72 --> 822.1600000000001
free will is coming from where from only

821.36 --> 825.36
yes

822.16 --> 826.3199999999999
because your atma is free to act yes as

825.36 --> 829.36
it wills

826.32 --> 831.36
yes yeah that's true it makes sense

829.36 --> 832.639
yeah yeah if there was no separation and

831.36 --> 833.1990000000001
there's no that thing they will never

832.639 --> 834.9590000000001
have any

833.199 --> 837.04
free will so the concept of free will

834.959 --> 838.88
also comes from the concept of atma only

837.04 --> 841.12
yeah and only that being part of your

838.88 --> 841.12
being

845.12 --> 849.199
and that's a fact and they are at

847.04 --> 853.36
different levels of evolution

849.199 --> 856.56
yes and rates and power and

853.36 --> 857.519
everything you know so as a whole yeah

856.56 --> 859.3599999999999
so

857.519 --> 861.04
that's that's all that's all there is to

859.36 --> 864.16
it it's a very simple concept

861.04 --> 864.639
you know if people understand it or you

864.16 --> 866.639
know like

864.639 --> 868.5600000000001
that's it's like it's very scientific

866.639 --> 871.6
you know in scientific you can

868.56 --> 873.3599999999999
terms partial fatality perfect fatality

871.6 --> 875.36
the difference between the partial

873.36 --> 879.12
currents perfect quorums

875.36 --> 881.36
yeah you know that's that's all it is

879.12 --> 883.36
so you say in your heat that the

881.36 --> 885.6800000000001
original creative spark which

883.36 --> 886.5600000000001
despite having created all the creations

885.68 --> 888.7199999999999
and dimensions

886.56 --> 890.8
lies outside of it also culture maybe it

888.72 --> 893.44
will elaborate on those parts

890.8 --> 895.04
okay like paramatma i put it as like a

893.44 --> 896.9590000000001
spark because like the atma is also a

895.04 --> 899.4399999999999
spark right

896.959 --> 900.079
okay now you can visit that like another

899.44 --> 902.639
spot

900.079 --> 903.279
okay but paramatma creates the whole

902.639 --> 907.199
thing

903.279 --> 909.279
yeah but then it still has to be outside

907.199 --> 910.3199999999999
you know it can't like even if you

909.279 --> 913.8389999999999
participate

910.32 --> 915.839
yeah you know you still outside the game

913.839 --> 917.6
you know you might not get caught up in

915.839 --> 919.2790000000001
it you know for example if a computer

917.6 --> 921.0400000000001
game person creates a computer game

919.279 --> 922.8
yeah now a lot of people around the

921.04 --> 925.199
world are very into that computer gaming

922.8 --> 926.079
yes you know they are playing madly and

925.199 --> 928.16
going crazy about

926.079 --> 929.8389999999999
it and you are the creator of that play

928.16 --> 931.36
that game once or twice

929.839 --> 932.8800000000001
okay but doesn't mean that you will get

931.36 --> 936.88
caught up in it

932.88 --> 938.72
like all these other people who who are

936.88 --> 940.56
caught up in it in that kind of way you

938.72 --> 943.6
know so that's what i mean

940.56 --> 952.56
okay that's why it's outside yes yes

943.6 --> 952.5600000000001
so my gratitude
