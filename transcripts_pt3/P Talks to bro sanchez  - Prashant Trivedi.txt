0.06 --> 5.7589999999999995
I have someone with me very special

3.36 --> 8.73
who's been dealing with Vedic cosmology

5.759 --> 11.04
or quite a while or you - I'm very

8.73 --> 13.679
peaceful beyond your life because it's

11.04 --> 16.5
all about truth and integrity and

13.679 --> 19.08
sincerity so that's why I'm here this is

16.5 --> 21.3
the right place to talk about these

19.08 --> 22.709999999999997
things and to talk about the Vedic past

21.3 --> 24.93
aspect of these things which has been

22.71 --> 27.119
ignored for so long now we're in for a

24.93 --> 29.73
treat today because here with someone

27.119 --> 32.07
that data I know they have a lot of

29.73 --> 34.559
knowledge on it so guys we don't have a

32.07 --> 36.54
great show today how did you come into

34.559 --> 40.459999999999994
flat earth and how long have you been

36.54 --> 40.46
around on a scene

40.77 --> 46.59
the thing is that in the like in the way

44.04 --> 49.26
the cosmology like earth is flat it's

46.59 --> 53.489000000000004
called boom under okay so it's called

49.26 --> 56.55
blue baby it's a flat plane it's a big

53.489 --> 58.62
plane but it is a flat plane so like to

56.55 --> 61.199
me it's like I mean I've known that

58.62 --> 63.718999999999994
since I was like 10 years old like the

61.199 --> 66.78
the whole this bola theory was only put

63.719 --> 68.76
in like four hundred five years ago like

66.78 --> 70.799
he just because they didn't teaching it

68.76 --> 72.42
in spoon and books and textbooks and

70.799 --> 74.79
that's the only way people have come to

72.42 --> 76.17
know that I mean but from the way the

74.79 --> 79.14
point of view which was always flat

76.17 --> 83.13
there is I mean the all the mathematics

79.14 --> 85.56
or the four four star plant movement

83.13 --> 88.229
movement everything happens on a basis

85.56 --> 90.03
of a flat earth I'm sort of associated

88.229 --> 92.07
with be the astrology culture dish and

90.03 --> 93.99
all the mathematics and calculations for

92.07 --> 96.119
that happen from a plat flat at point of

93.99 --> 99.72
view so you can say that I've been in a

96.119 --> 102.15
for long long time way before this topic

99.72 --> 104.46
even started on the Internet

102.15 --> 107.369
you're someone that's in a unique

104.46 --> 109.259
position you live in England I would

107.369 --> 111.869
consider you a Vedic and I'm not

109.259 --> 115.409
striving to be a Vedic vagin yeah oh

111.869 --> 117.899
yeah I love the culture it's something I

115.409 --> 120.39
strive spiritually to be a part of I

117.899 --> 121.95
love the concept with Mama Kali

120.39 --> 123.63
I mean I've never seen any black or

121.95 --> 125.46000000000001
white person I've never seen those

123.63 --> 127.04899999999999
things I've never seen anybody black I'm

125.46 --> 128.72899999999998
not seeing anybody right like nobody

127.049 --> 132.24
looks white nobody looks black like

128.729 --> 134.22000000000003
paper I mean nobody looks

132.24 --> 136.35000000000002
but anyway like in the waited thing

134.22 --> 139.02
though like whole earth is like a sort

136.35 --> 141.6
of family and community it's not like

139.02 --> 143.28
all this thing is not there and and it's

141.6 --> 146.37
a good thing you point a pointed out the

143.28 --> 149.37
Vedic word like we had to dissociate

146.37 --> 152.52
that word with Hindu and Indian because

149.37 --> 154.8
the word Indian was made by the

152.52 --> 156.57000000000002
so-called English like there's a river

154.8 --> 158.13000000000002
colonists so whatever people lived on

156.57 --> 159.63
that side of the river so they call that

158.13 --> 162.48
India and then those people became

159.63 --> 164.4
Indians and the same in do river because

162.48 --> 167.7
they couldn't pronounce in do they call

164.4 --> 169.68
it in this so which became him do it

167.7 --> 171.39
became India so it had nothing to do

169.68 --> 174.03
with the Vedic knowledge president

171.39 --> 175.79999999999998
acknowledged was there all over but in

174.03 --> 178.23
that particular landmass which was

175.8 --> 179.82000000000002
called horrid before that was what is

178.23 --> 181.64999999999998
call India now was called thurid's that

179.82 --> 185.60999999999999
was his real name now the Barretts

181.65 --> 187.86
goddess was party so party became Britta

185.61 --> 190.489
so but now these people could not

187.86 --> 193.23000000000002
pronounce Britta so they call it Britta

190.489 --> 196.47
but I became Britney which became

193.23 --> 198.209
Britannia which became Great Britain

196.47 --> 201.09
which became and which was ruling the

198.209 --> 203.94
world for you know how many years so

201.09 --> 206.12
that Britannia is everywhere and so that

203.94 --> 208.829
the name actually comes from harlots and

206.12 --> 211.019
Marathi and so they took away that name

208.829 --> 213.239
and they put the name India so what

211.019 --> 214.95000000000002
right now the Indian thing is or the

213.239 --> 216.66
Hindu thing is it's not totally

214.95 --> 218.97
congruent with the vedic thing it's not

216.66 --> 220.829
going as per the way they like they've

218.97 --> 222.75
gone very far away from the vedic thing

220.829 --> 225.42000000000002
so people should not try and associate

222.75 --> 227.73
the vedic thing with with the Indians or

225.42 --> 229.67999999999998
the Hindu religion as it stands today

227.73 --> 231.29899999999998
because this is a making up religion

229.68 --> 233.459
thing because Vedic was never a religion

231.299 --> 235.98000000000002
it was like a whole cosmology it was

233.459 --> 237.57
like the whole thing I mean to call it

235.98 --> 239.67
religion is like a making a joke College

237.57 --> 242.04
so like it's not like Islam Hashanah T

239.67 --> 244.57999999999998
or any of these things you know it's

242.04 --> 247.2
nothing it's not one book thing

244.58 --> 248.55
Hinduism right now I mean the cosmology

247.2 --> 251.60999999999999
is not there anyways it's not like

248.55 --> 253.02
Indian study way the things or every

251.61 --> 256.079
Indian knows where the cosmology of

253.02 --> 256.73900000000003
Vedic it's not so like not everybody

256.079 --> 258.359
does that

256.739 --> 260.66999999999996
okay so it's only people who are

258.359 --> 262.71
interested in that study that or go into

260.67 --> 265.2
that like it's not like a done deal like

262.71 --> 267.53999999999996
when you're that like you will study

265.2 --> 269.90999999999997
that and modern Hinduism is just like a

267.54 --> 272.13
way of like having fun and having sweets

269.91 --> 273.72
and and the celebrating in Hinduism

272.13 --> 276.84
there's just many more holidays than

273.72 --> 278.70000000000005
this Christmas I mean it's more about

276.84 --> 280.22999999999996
having that kind of thing I mean it's

278.7 --> 281.7
nothing to do with the actual real Vedic

280.23 --> 284.16
thing from the past the thing was that

281.7 --> 286.26
when the so called English came to India

284.16 --> 290.25
and that planning which was valid and

286.26 --> 291.69
they knew that that knowledge was core

290.25 --> 293.37
knowledge it was real it was most

291.69 --> 295.29
ancient and all of that and that's why

293.37 --> 296.97
they put it in the back burner from that

295.29 --> 298.53000000000003
point they made sure that it was not

296.97 --> 298.91900000000004
gonna come out or spread out in the

298.53 --> 301.169
world

298.919 --> 303.69
hey I'm lovin Easter and the people who

301.169 --> 306.24
used to and you said not too many people

303.69 --> 308.9
in his new flattered awakening he's

306.24 --> 311.76
bringing up the Vedic cosmology

308.9 --> 315.29999999999995
knowledge is cosmology like the

311.76 --> 317.28
astrology the whole lifestyle the basics

315.3 --> 318.69
everything like connects you know for

317.28 --> 321.09
example you select in the West they

318.69 --> 323.669
think become is baby but based it in

321.09 --> 325.56
this week but beacon is not because in

323.669 --> 329.19
the Vedic thing cow is very important

325.56 --> 331.14
the cows like cows like you know how

329.19 --> 333.27
earth is mother and cow is mother you

331.14 --> 335.07
know and from the cows milk actually you

333.27 --> 336.81
can get very healthy actually and you

335.07 --> 338.729
can take out all the diseases and stuff

336.81 --> 341.22
like earlier in Vedic times is to like

338.729 --> 342.33
let cows home in the jungle you know

341.22 --> 344.22
when the when the cow supposed to go to

342.33 --> 346.46999999999997
the jungle and they would eat different

344.22 --> 347.52000000000004
herbs you know in the jungle and then

346.47 --> 350.01000000000005
they came back they'll just take out of

347.52 --> 352.169
them where you can drink that and you

350.01 --> 354.18
cure everything you know you don't have

352.169 --> 356.78999999999996
to go pick all the herbs yourself in the

354.18 --> 359.13
jungle and you know and because the cow

356.79 --> 361.74
Khan you better which ones are better

359.13 --> 364.02
and which have you mean that I know you

361.74 --> 366.26
might be requiring at the time so so the

364.02 --> 368.90999999999997
way the thing is very like milk based

366.26 --> 370.71
system actually not a vegan system it's

368.91 --> 372.33000000000004
a vegetarian system because ways teen

370.71 --> 373.75
ism actually came from what is now

372.33 --> 376.96
calling the only

373.75 --> 378.99
society very society so so all the based

376.96 --> 382.27
on products and the vegetables and

378.99 --> 385.54
lentils and Rice's and different grains

382.27 --> 386.95
all of that fruits everything is of

385.54 --> 388.18
spice is everything is pretty much

386.95 --> 390.19
coming from what is called India now

388.18 --> 392.47
like as far as food is concerned and

390.19 --> 394.99
basics like that is concerned I mean

392.47 --> 398.05
people would have learnt a lot from the

394.99 --> 400.51
aiviq perspective and the Bailey cooking

398.05 --> 403.33
and the way I alway the sensibility

400.51 --> 406.24
about that topic you say that the cows

403.33 --> 408.94
are sacred when we deal with the various

406.24 --> 411.49
that's awesome yes yeah one of the most

408.94 --> 414.85
famous Egyptian deities was a cow

411.49 --> 418.57
goddess and she was ash yet her daughter

414.85 --> 420.66900000000004
Dorian that orders bull symbolism with

418.57 --> 422.26
the horns you know because and the

420.669 --> 424.59999999999997
Taurus is the sign for earth is well

422.26 --> 426.73
when you say Taurus when you say earth

424.6 --> 428.77000000000004
when you say cow when you say Hathor

426.73 --> 431.07
it's the same thing you're talking

428.77 --> 433.96
actually the same thing all four things

431.07 --> 435.61
that's amazing but the cow wasn't even

433.96 --> 438.01
considered an animal like it was never

435.61 --> 439.72
considered an animal like never like no

438.01 --> 443.46999999999997
under no way that you would with the

439.72 --> 445.75
ancestors considered the cow the towers

443.47 --> 448.12
like select heart the same as you

445.75 --> 453.58
consider it's called blue David in

448.12 --> 457.18
suspect living entity and there are and

453.58 --> 460.51
there a factor of the he said that cows

457.18 --> 462.31
are a fractal of the earth you

460.51 --> 465.71999999999997
understand what he's saying it's very

462.31 --> 465.72
very very cow

469.36 --> 474.66900000000004
other than me

471.43 --> 477.91
it's a huge thing in science I always

474.669 --> 480.34
like a small microcosmic form of Earth I

477.91 --> 482.199
mean you can touch all of Earth but you

480.34 --> 485.02
can touch a cow like as a whole

482.199 --> 488.289
so it's which is available to you in the

485.02 --> 490.33
same form but in a smaller size so it's

488.289 --> 492.58
a fractal in that way and the cows are

490.33 --> 494.65
four hoots like they travel on the land

492.58 --> 496.449
with four hooves and they

494.65 --> 499.27
electromagnetics thing in their genes

496.449 --> 501.46000000000004
and DNA are the same as the alien a

499.27 --> 503.5
wandering so whatever earth has energy

501.46 --> 506.19899999999996
and vibration field or electro magnetics

503.5 --> 508.93
in a certain landmass the cows have the

506.199 --> 511.69
same in their DNA with the cause of that

508.93 --> 514.36
particular area so they are a direct

511.69 --> 517.24
reflection of the land basically the

514.36 --> 519.339
line in the cow one yeah we tell each

517.24 --> 522.61
other all the time in America we say

519.339 --> 525.6400000000001
holy cow we say hey man that's [ __ ]

522.61 --> 528.13
and we say these things to desecrate the

525.64 --> 530.01
cow because in the Western world the cow

528.13 --> 533.23
is the number one slaughter

530.01 --> 534.55
quote-unquote animal is coming but then

533.23 --> 536.7090000000001
but then you see the results as well

534.55 --> 538.3
then everybody's going crazy as well I

536.709 --> 539.56
mean so when you do that there is a

538.3 --> 541.63
result effect you need as an action

539.56 --> 542.9799999999999
there's a consequence so it's like the

541.63 --> 544.66
results are there in the West for what

542.98 --> 546.339
is what has been done I mean there's

544.66 --> 547.99
like that's why they have had World War

546.339 --> 549.8800000000001
one would work do they always have wars

547.99 --> 552.22
they're always that craziness and and

549.88 --> 554.2
things are just always going crazy they

552.22 --> 556.0
never settle in the West because the

554.2 --> 558.13
basics are not right like when you hit

556.0 --> 559.66
the basics everything else falls apart

558.13 --> 561.4
it's like you know if you don't have a

559.66 --> 562.63
foundation you can't make a building

561.4 --> 564.52
every time you make a building it'll

562.63 --> 565.9
fall now you don't have fun foundation

564.52 --> 567.64
and that's all the thing I find in the

565.9 --> 569.35
West this the basics are always missing

567.64 --> 570.73
even if they're like a truther community

569.35 --> 572.1700000000001
and people are trying to teach people

570.73 --> 573.76
and people trying to each other people

572.17 --> 576.55
and the same people are wearing watches

573.76 --> 578.76
they don't even know that how harmful

576.55 --> 580.9
have watches for a human being you know

578.76 --> 582.22
notice that it is a slave insignia and

580.9 --> 584.89
there's actual science to it like

582.22 --> 587.02
because this is your heart and your

584.89 --> 589.4499999999999
heartbeat okay and this is your first

587.02 --> 591.4
way you wear the watch this way your

589.45 --> 593.35
purse thumbs and then you put a watch on

591.4 --> 595.72
top of it which is like a machine beat

593.35 --> 598.3000000000001
heart beat is not machine beat heart

595.72 --> 599.9200000000001
beats with variability it's called heart

598.3 --> 601.27
rate variability the heart rate

599.92 --> 603.9699999999999
variability is what gives you an immune

601.27 --> 604.99
system and it is your spiritual beat now

603.97 --> 607.4200000000001
your heart beat

604.99 --> 609.4590000000001
when you put a machine beep on top of it

607.42 --> 611.68
which is the watch you actually playing

609.459 --> 613.0
these two songs at the same time and

611.68 --> 615.459
you're interrupting your heartbeat

613.0 --> 616.72
you're basically disturbing it and

615.459 --> 617.9499999999999
that's why you disturbing your immune

616.72 --> 619.48
system you're just disturbing your

617.95 --> 622.0600000000001
spiritual life you're disturbing

619.48 --> 624.73
everything by waiting that watch and the

622.06 --> 627.399
same thing carries on to like machine

624.73 --> 629.08
music machine beats that's why I am so

627.399 --> 631.149
against machine beats like you know all

629.08 --> 633.97
the sounds in music it is made by

631.149 --> 637.39
machines on the computers not made by

633.97 --> 639.4590000000001
human being not organic you know that is

637.39 --> 642.1899999999999
not good for you is the same it does the

639.459 --> 644.0799999999999
same for you as I've watched us wearing

642.19 --> 646.4200000000001
a watch so I mean these kind of little

644.08 --> 648.1
basics are not there at all in the order

646.42 --> 650.68
through the community like people just

648.1 --> 653.02
are like running to try and teach and

650.68 --> 655.51
preach without knowing even basic things

653.02 --> 657.31
for themselves people just keep on going

655.51 --> 659.4399999999999
down in circles and it creates a good

657.31 --> 662.1999999999999
like old cycle of confusion you know

659.44 --> 665.1400000000001
yeah you definitely right man I can

662.2 --> 668.38
definitely see it how when we look at

665.14 --> 671.41
the Western world it is so far behind

668.38 --> 674.01
when it comes to spirituality when we go

671.41 --> 674.01
to the east

674.54 --> 679.79
now when we talk about veganism they

677.45 --> 683.0300000000001
stand in opposition of it and they

679.79 --> 685.25
actually proud to be partaking in the

683.03 --> 687.62
eating of flesh most meat-eaters they're

685.25 --> 689.48
proud of it mostly you're just born into

687.62 --> 692.48
it okay the thing is going to be born

689.48 --> 694.13
into it it takes some kind of sense to

692.48 --> 695.9
get out of it in that sense comes from

694.13 --> 697.52
actually going to see where the animals

695.9 --> 699.14
are cut and how they are slaughtered how

697.52 --> 700.52
it is done anything that people who are

699.14 --> 702.14
eating meat I mean if they are killing

700.52 --> 703.43
the animals themselves and if they have

702.14 --> 705.14
to do with everything themselves then it

703.43 --> 708.14
a different scene not many people would

705.14 --> 711.92
be eating me in on this earth like that

708.14 --> 714.41
was the case if you come to know it's

711.92 --> 716.9599999999999
flat then the main point which comes up

714.41 --> 720.14
is that there has to be some up and

716.96 --> 721.49
there has to be some down ok ok that is

720.14 --> 723.35
the main thing which comes out of it

721.49 --> 724.91
like which people miss like I mean when

723.35 --> 726.47
they when they had a ball just spinning

724.91 --> 727.67
around the Sun and the Sun was spinning

726.47 --> 729.0500000000001
around the galaxy there was no

727.67 --> 730.2199999999999
up-and-down you just going round and

729.05 --> 733.0999999999999
round and round for no rhyme or reason

730.22 --> 734.36
okay so this up and down which opens up

733.1 --> 735.74
that means there are planes of existence

734.36 --> 738.71
above and there are planes of existence

735.74 --> 740.63
below ok that's the thing which opens up

738.71 --> 741.6800000000001
from Flat Earth and that is the meaning

740.63 --> 743.81
which people should take out of that

741.68 --> 745.31
earth not or any of this like I mean

743.81 --> 746.8699999999999
curvature is not dead and all of that is

745.31 --> 748.88
just basic stuff I mean that should be

746.87 --> 751.16
put to the that thing it is a done deal

748.88 --> 753.05
now I mean even from the eclipses or

751.16 --> 754.8199999999999
different things you can totally figure

753.05 --> 757.76
out there is no curvature at all I mean

754.82 --> 759.0500000000001
that is very like a little small step

757.76 --> 761.84
one has to move forward from there

759.05 --> 763.64
understand there is a up and there is a

761.84 --> 765.14
down you know there's a higher there's a

763.64 --> 767.3
lower I mean in the West like this

765.14 --> 769.8199999999999
higher lower concept is so ridiculed

767.3 --> 771.4699999999999
because there is this holy quality thing

769.82 --> 772.7900000000001
like you know that means it's just here

771.47 --> 774.5
and you're not doing anywhere in and

772.79 --> 776.48
there's no high there is no below like

774.5 --> 777.98
there is no here like there's no better

776.48 --> 782.39
States or worse state that is the

777.98 --> 785.57
problem and platter was the first step

782.39 --> 787.55
in actually understanding that how this

785.57 --> 789.62
multiverse actually is like it's not

787.55 --> 793.16
what they taught you to be like just the

789.62 --> 794.42
3d universe you know which was taught in

793.16 --> 796.43
school it's not that it is the

794.42 --> 799.79
multiverse and it it has the layers and

796.43 --> 801.14
planes of existence belief is not

799.79 --> 802.55
required when you actually come to know

801.14 --> 804.1999999999999
something I mean right now in this road

802.55 --> 805.87
everybody knows is infinite so like

804.2 --> 807.73
there's no belief required and

805.87 --> 810.01
with amazing thing they knew this plane

807.73 --> 811.39
they could travel in between so when you

810.01 --> 813.46
know something then it becomes like

811.39 --> 816.01
normal it doesn't stay in the realm of

813.46 --> 817.9000000000001
belief anymore man Europe you are

816.01 --> 820.029
killing it now let me ask you something

817.9 --> 822.76
what when you leave your body and astral

820.029 --> 824.89
projection are you in the same area you

822.76 --> 827.5889999999999
just waking up on another plane and it's

824.89 --> 830.38
like a fractal it's another it's another

827.589 --> 831.5200000000001
plane but you're like spirits cord is

830.38 --> 833.38
still attached to your physical body

831.52 --> 835.9
there's a silver cord which is still

833.38 --> 837.82
attached so you are in another plane but

835.9 --> 839.23
your physical body is in this plane but

837.82 --> 842.0200000000001
I'm an you are - but this will record

839.23 --> 843.22
still ok so when you go around with a

842.02 --> 845.05
silver cord is still attached and when

843.22 --> 847.4200000000001
you come back like that's why you come

845.05 --> 850.7199999999999
back when you were traveling to like

847.42 --> 853.7199999999999
higher planes mostly most beings don't

850.72 --> 855.9100000000001
have the energy to go there anyways like

853.72 --> 858.1600000000001
what is takes like whatever your body is

855.91 --> 859.779
like because whatever your spirit body

858.16 --> 863.38
is which is called Merkabah like you

859.779 --> 865.54
know guys charged and buys the container

863.38 --> 868.6899999999999
the whole your spirit body it doesn't

865.54 --> 871.06
have enough charge to actually propel

868.69 --> 872.7090000000001
you into the higher planes so like

871.06 --> 875.05
ancients whenever they were on earth

872.709 --> 877.15
they were developing their charged body

875.05 --> 878.92
to that point where they can travel to

877.15 --> 882.279
higher planes your life was actually a

878.92 --> 883.75
preparation for doing that when you need

882.279 --> 885.31
to go to those higher planes and another

883.75 --> 887.08
thing which you need to know for going

885.31 --> 888.91
to higher planes netiquette after energy

887.08 --> 889.9300000000001
if you don't have the etiquette if you

888.91 --> 891.25
don't know how the manners if you don't

889.93 --> 894.25
have that then you won't last then you

891.25 --> 896.98
will be kicked out very quickly so I

894.25 --> 898.93
mean even if you get there there's gonna

896.98 --> 902.74
be not no point that's why most people

898.93 --> 903.8499999999999
are stucked at lower planes is just one

902.74 --> 907.51
simple reason they don't know how to

903.85 --> 910.029
behave in a higher realm it's a plain

907.51 --> 912.61
simple matter of behavior do we want to

910.029 --> 915.66
continue to behavior or we encourage it

912.61 --> 918.19
well this art is like the middle ground

915.66 --> 920.9499999999999
okay so according to Vedic thing the

918.19 --> 922.5100000000001
earth is right in the middle like there

920.95 --> 927.7900000000001
are seven planes below then seven planes

922.51 --> 929.8
above so there so all the traffic lot of

927.79 --> 932.68
traffic from down to up and up to down

929.8 --> 934.3
all goes through words okay so are these

932.68 --> 935.3199999999999
like Midgard what they call to the Norse

934.3 --> 938.5889999999999
mythology Midgard

935.32 --> 940.75
so in in the Vedic is called boom on you

938.589 --> 945.61
okay so it's right in the middle of the

940.75 --> 946.93
thing okay and was used by even beings

945.61 --> 948.5790000000001
which were in the higher planes for

946.93 --> 950.02
example if somebody is in heaven heaven

948.579 --> 953.26
is just the next higher thing it's

950.02 --> 955.51
called Swan okay okay so after swerve

953.26 --> 958.6
there are other higher planes called the

955.51 --> 961.27
Apollo Rishi lok jan lok there are many

958.6 --> 963.1
other planes above that even above

961.27 --> 964.75
heaven heavens above heavens above

963.1 --> 966.49
heavens unless you get to the ground

964.75 --> 969.22
loop which is the highest point and then

966.49 --> 970.75
there are planes above that pool which

969.22 --> 975.22
are then may not even place there well

970.75 --> 976.69
okay so so there is a like when the

975.22 --> 978.28
multiverse was created in the beginning

976.69 --> 983.23
all the realms were created

978.28 --> 985.36
simultaneously okay except there was no

983.23 --> 987.97
hair but there was no pain and torture

985.36 --> 989.32
in the beginning it was just the whole

987.97 --> 991.15
multiverse was the experiential thing

989.32 --> 993.73
but from the top plane to the bottom

991.15 --> 996.31
plane there was no pain no torture be no

993.73 --> 998.29
torture only started later when people

996.31 --> 1000.7199999999999
broke the laws of the multiverse

998.29 --> 1003.27
multiverse has laws and rules and beings

1000.72 --> 1006.36
broke those and that's where the whole

1003.27 --> 1008.279
problem started from so like stable the

1006.36 --> 1009.87
time on earth even when no one had a

1008.279 --> 1013.41
disease no one was diseased no one ever

1009.87 --> 1015.69
had a disease no one experience any pain

1013.41 --> 1019.26
even on this earth plane I'm talking

1015.69 --> 1023.1300000000001
about you know this is interesting

1019.26 --> 1025.1
evil it was in always in existence it

1023.13 --> 1026.939
actually has an aura Nina

1025.1 --> 1030.06
according to Vedic thing there is no

1026.939 --> 1032.459
such thing as evil actually first okay

1030.06 --> 1034.8799999999999
wholly wrong or negativity is just the

1032.459 --> 1037.679
breaking the murderous law that's all

1034.88 --> 1039.5400000000002
there is no there is no such thing they

1037.679 --> 1040.709
know villains you called laws of nature

1039.54 --> 1043.02
they're the laws of the market evils

1040.709 --> 1045.72
okay so they are there laws are there

1043.02 --> 1047.939
and I mean and they're very simple laws

1045.72 --> 1049.77
okay they're not very complicated is and

1047.939 --> 1051.15
whatever laws on this earth would people

1049.77 --> 1053.19
man-made laws they don't matter at all

1051.15 --> 1055.14
like you know whether you follow them or

1053.19 --> 1056.79
not makes no difference you know I mean

1055.14 --> 1058.44
when you follow those laws that's much

1056.79 --> 1060.33
more important whatever nonsense they

1058.44 --> 1062.25
made created or the system they've

1060.33 --> 1063.57
created on earth which they call society

1062.25 --> 1067.11
those laws don't matter

1063.57 --> 1069.09
actually these laws you speaker were

1067.11 --> 1073.5
created by a group of

1069.09 --> 1075.539
families so my question to you is a lot

1073.5 --> 1078.57
of us say man these people are so

1075.539 --> 1080.34
powerful they are so evil you know like

1078.57 --> 1083.1899999999998
the bird which is banded around this

1080.34 --> 1085.77
calling of naughty okay and I call them

1083.19 --> 1089.429
desperate person okay

1085.77 --> 1091.4089999999999
desperado desperately that's my time for

1089.429 --> 1093.51
this if what does that mean when is that

1091.409 --> 1095.0700000000002
translates to in English it means

1093.51 --> 1098.309
they're desperate this is desperate

1095.07 --> 1100.1689999999999
they're not powerful okay but powerful

1098.309 --> 1101.9089999999999
means like if you have power then you

1100.169 --> 1102.8990000000001
don't need to rule like this you can do

1101.909 --> 1104.88
in style

1102.899 --> 1106.559
how will you open okay I mean they have

1104.88 --> 1108.419
made up this game right now okay on

1106.559 --> 1110.6399999999999
earth okay they are made up this thing

1108.419 --> 1112.7990000000002
or the system is I mean that can be

1110.64 --> 1114.659
finished in 10 minutes like the whole

1112.799 --> 1116.1
continents can go down would put rice

1114.659 --> 1118.2
seeds can rise up bases are there will

1116.1 --> 1120.3899999999999
be continents okay and they will not be

1118.2 --> 1123.0
able to do a single thing about they

1120.39 --> 1125.279
always helpless actually too much bigger

1123.0 --> 1127.289
forces than then okay which are there in

1125.279 --> 1129.87
this multiverse okay so they are very

1127.289 --> 1130.919
small little ponds I mean like they say

1129.87 --> 1133.559
like they can control whether through

1130.919 --> 1134.88
half okay and I am saying that half

1133.559 --> 1135.299
cannot control any weather or anything

1134.88 --> 1137.64
like that

1135.299 --> 1139.98
okay I mean I am or radio challenge

1137.64 --> 1141.2700000000002
HAARP any time and let let let them say

1139.98 --> 1142.98
like the Econo HAARP is gonna do this

1141.27 --> 1144.96
here and I'm gonna say I'm gonna do that

1142.98 --> 1146.7
there let's see what happens whether my

1144.96 --> 1149.25
thing happens on half things happen like

1146.7 --> 1151.529
they are more closer to the you know the

1149.25 --> 1153.48
guy in Wizard of Oz you know the movie

1151.529 --> 1155.1
Wizard of Oz everybody knows that you

1153.48 --> 1157.679
know that old man behind the curtain

1155.1 --> 1159.9599999999998
which is always saying that it has got

1157.679 --> 1162.6000000000001
this it has got that you know but it's

1159.96 --> 1165.299
just it's all smoke and mirrors

1162.6 --> 1167.52
these people don't have all those things

1165.299 --> 1168.96
which they say they do which everybody

1167.52 --> 1171.4189999999999
knew like just like the man on the moon

1168.96 --> 1172.89
and all that which has been proven to be

1171.419 --> 1174.1200000000001
fake if you don't want to pass them on

1172.89 --> 1175.5590000000002
the board if you not gonna trust them on

1174.12 --> 1180.6299999999999
the moon you can't trust them on any of

1175.559 --> 1183.24
these things either reptilians archons

1180.63 --> 1184.95
yeah who are a human who are these

1183.24 --> 1186.21
people when it they didn't pound yeah

1184.95 --> 1188.25
okay okay

1186.21 --> 1190.2
I'll pray play both the things up first

1188.25 --> 1192.21
like how like how it happened what

1190.2 --> 1196.14
happened these people are in this

1192.21 --> 1200.6100000000001
position only because people as a whole

1196.14 --> 1202.95
went against the laws themselves first

1200.61 --> 1205.7099999999998
so when you do that

1202.95 --> 1207.72
you lose power yourself okay like in

1205.71 --> 1209.67
India for example people went against

1207.72 --> 1211.74
the way the Quai for 5000 years like

1209.67 --> 1213.8100000000002
last 5000 years people went against the

1211.74 --> 1215.91
Vedic way so right now the situation

1213.81 --> 1217.71
after 5000 years is that they are under

1215.91 --> 1219.75
that system they have a reserve bank

1217.71 --> 1221.07
they have they are under that think they

1219.75 --> 1222.24
under the cosh and all of that they

1221.07 --> 1224.25
under the monetary system and all of

1222.24 --> 1226.41
that which India didn't need to be at

1224.25 --> 1228.12
all there was no reason for India to be

1226.41 --> 1231.3300000000002
under the monetary system in any way

1228.12 --> 1233.04
what whatsoever okay it only happened

1231.33 --> 1235.71
because people went against the way

1233.04 --> 1237.51
against the money and then whenever

1235.71 --> 1239.55
there is a weakness there is always

1237.51 --> 1242.04
someone there to exploit it that is

1239.55 --> 1244.5
always the case and when those people

1242.04 --> 1246.6599999999999
are exploiting that they don't want the

1244.5 --> 1248.94
people who are born down to come up so

1246.66 --> 1252.18
they'll obviously try the best they can

1248.94 --> 1253.8600000000001
to keep the people down and to keep the

1252.18 --> 1256.02
people in that state so that they don't

1253.86 --> 1258.1799999999998
get away from them or they don't rise

1256.02 --> 1260.15
point is if any human being takes

1258.18 --> 1263.5800000000002
responsibility for themselves right now

1260.15 --> 1266.2800000000002
will they be they can rise above this

1263.58 --> 1268.26
system you know like if they just go

1266.28 --> 1270.96
within and take responsibility for their

1268.26 --> 1272.82
own self they can rise over system easy

1270.96 --> 1274.68
because it's not a very strong system

1272.82 --> 1276.6899999999998
and as far as archons are concerned

1274.68 --> 1279.66
archons are actually what I call grahas

1276.69 --> 1283.2
like Venus Jupiter Saturn Mercury Moon

1279.66 --> 1284.5800000000002
and Sun okay these grahas which are

1283.2 --> 1286.47
called grahas in sanskrit Caesars they

1284.58 --> 1288.87
are the archons which these people talk

1286.47 --> 1291.84
about and they have been put in place to

1288.87 --> 1293.28
give people energies as per their past

1291.84 --> 1294.6599999999999
actions so whenever beings have done

1293.28 --> 1296.52
they past actions they take this birth

1294.66 --> 1299.28
and these beings regulate their lives

1296.52 --> 1302.28
what they call our corn in the West is

1299.28 --> 1304.08
actually this ok like it's nothing to do

1302.28 --> 1306.18
with these people who are making these

1304.08 --> 1307.6799999999998
governments these people who are doing

1306.18 --> 1309.0600000000002
these things also like I mean they're

1307.68 --> 1310.89
working on these kind of base like for

1309.06 --> 1312.99
example like they want people to eat

1310.89 --> 1315.69
meat okay and that thing so they have

1312.99 --> 1317.76
made up this whole meat that thing and

1315.69 --> 1320.8500000000001
after that they know that if animals are

1317.76 --> 1322.83
killed a negative energy is created ok

1320.85 --> 1324.27
so like our negative force field is

1322.83 --> 1327.3
traded so then they will sacrifice

1324.27 --> 1330.06
certain amount of humans as well to

1327.3 --> 1331.56
balance that negative field ok like

1330.06 --> 1333.12
otherwise everything will go to hell

1331.56 --> 1334.95
straight away like people will just go

1333.12 --> 1335.9599999999998
mad and like that nobody will be able to

1334.95 --> 1337.04
go to work and

1335.96 --> 1339.5900000000001
the whole thing looks pattern out of

1337.04 --> 1342.62
control so yeah these sacrifices are

1339.59 --> 1344.6599999999999
called Wars they organize wars in order

1342.62 --> 1346.6399999999999
to do these human sacrifices but these

1344.66 --> 1348.8600000000001
have to be organized only because animal

1346.64 --> 1350.5700000000002
sacrifices are happening before so they

1348.86 --> 1354.26
have to balance that out so these beings

1350.57 --> 1356.6299999999999
know these kind of rules there was a

1354.26 --> 1359.87
time where there was no such thing as

1356.63 --> 1361.8500000000001
predators and prey no animals hunted

1359.87 --> 1364.33
each other and we all were living with

1361.85 --> 1368.57
the plants and everything was peaceful

1364.33 --> 1371.06
happiness love and so yes that's the way

1368.57 --> 1372.95
that is you could call it the Vedic like

1371.06 --> 1375.8
when everybody's following the laws I

1372.95 --> 1379.8500000000001
mean nobody can be like if a being is

1375.8 --> 1383.26
following the laws they can not be like

1379.85 --> 1385.9699999999998
used they cannot be like exploited

1383.26 --> 1388.28
exploitation is not possible there was a

1385.97 --> 1390.68
time like that and people went against

1388.28 --> 1392.36
that and people think there are cycles

1390.68 --> 1394.01
like this that it happens cyclically

1392.36 --> 1396.4699999999998
it's not like that there are no cycles

1394.01 --> 1396.95
like this either it happened so it

1396.47 --> 1399.3500000000001
doesn't happen

1396.95 --> 1402.2
I mean Golden Age can last millions of

1399.35 --> 1405.1999999999998
years there is no such boundary to it

1402.2 --> 1407.21
that hole is going to happen there is no

1405.2 --> 1408.56
such nice is it necessary thing in the

1407.21 --> 1411.41
waiting thing the concept is that there

1408.56 --> 1412.7
that once things get too bad on any

1411.41 --> 1415.88
plane whether it's earth plane or any

1412.7 --> 1419.66
other plane beings from higher realms do

1415.88 --> 1422.75
intercede yeah when things get too bad

1419.66 --> 1425.42
on any realm beings from higher realms

1422.75 --> 1427.73
and to see now that's very comforting to

1425.42 --> 1429.0800000000002
me to hear that to me what is called the

1427.73 --> 1431.42
word avatar son Smith

1429.08 --> 1433.25
it's called about that okay you know

1431.42 --> 1435.65
like there's a movie called avatar and

1433.25 --> 1437.51
there was all these icons emojis are

1435.65 --> 1439.3700000000001
called avatars everything is called that

1437.51 --> 1442.22
avatar concept comes around from that

1439.37 --> 1443.75
Sanskrit term which means crossing over

1442.22 --> 1446.57
from higher dimension to lower dimension

1443.75 --> 1451.16
of a being to take care of the situation

1446.57 --> 1455.6899999999998
on any plane so so so these beings that

1451.16 --> 1458.21
and to see when things get too bad have

1455.69 --> 1460.64
they interceded here on earth here yeah

1458.21 --> 1462.56
I mean many times many times in there

1460.64 --> 1464.7800000000002
are lot of Quranic stories Vedic stories

1462.56 --> 1467.12
about which being sophisticated but not

1464.78 --> 1468.98
know these means fail their missions

1467.12 --> 1471.59
because the earth is still bad

1468.98 --> 1473.39
I'll answer that like this has happened

1471.59 --> 1475.4299999999998
over millions and millions of years okay

1473.39 --> 1478.1000000000001
so if something goes right for a while

1475.43 --> 1480.02
and it was it wasn't bad like bad right

1478.1 --> 1481.6399999999999
now every time bad is different the

1480.02 --> 1483.23
beings in power get corrupted different

1481.64 --> 1485.5700000000002
times which are different from right now

1483.23 --> 1488.09
and we correct that thing at a time and

1485.57 --> 1490.22
then it goes fine for a while until it

1488.09 --> 1492.11
changes again it's not like it doesn't

1490.22 --> 1494.66
go fine for a while you know what I

1492.11 --> 1497.3
totally understand it now with that

1494.66 --> 1500.6000000000001
being said can we also say that this

1497.3 --> 1504.11
cosmos we live in is is not perfect it's

1500.6 --> 1506.03
a work in progress I mean yeah I'm

1504.11 --> 1507.9499999999998
perfect in the sense that after the

1506.03 --> 1509.51
Creator like in the Vedic thing there's

1507.95 --> 1511.01
a desert Finity you know like Brahma

1509.51 --> 1513.3799999999999
Vishnu and [ __ ] now Brahma is the

1511.01 --> 1515.15
creator like he creates and like that's

1513.38 --> 1517.16
why all these religions you know these

1515.15 --> 1519.44
three religions like Judaism

1517.16 --> 1521.1200000000001
Christianity in Islam they are Abrahamic

1519.44 --> 1523.91
religions they call Abrahamic religions

1521.12 --> 1526.85
okay now what Abraham comes from Brahma

1523.91 --> 1528.5
only okay if you take the a out of

1526.85 --> 1532.37
Brahma and put it in the front you get

1528.5 --> 1535.48
even like Abram like okay so and it is

1532.37 --> 1538.55
the same the Creator has got no control

1535.48 --> 1539.27
after the creation is created it has no

1538.55 --> 1541.1599999999999
control over it

1539.27 --> 1543.71
there are things entities for preserver

1541.16 --> 1545.8700000000001
and destroyer there to move which was

1543.71 --> 1550.49
called Vishnu which is neuron which is

1545.87 --> 1553.01
called and ship in the Vedic thing the

1550.49 --> 1555.41
Vishnu czar of at least 100 types of

1553.01 --> 1557.54
which tools are there with which aren't

1555.41 --> 1559.46
there like in different realms with

1557.54 --> 1561.74
different positions and different things

1559.46 --> 1562.79
wedeck thing is very vast like the the

1561.74 --> 1565.55
goddess is if you look come to the

1562.79 --> 1567.68
goddesses in in the way dating they are

1565.55 --> 1570.68
there more than thousand Boris's more

1567.68 --> 1572.18
than thousand okay so when you say Carly

1570.68 --> 1576.17
for example you said Maha Kali

1572.18 --> 1579.5600000000002
okay now word Kali comes from kala means

1576.17 --> 1582.77
time so the the Shakti the energy of

1579.56 --> 1585.23
time okay which is the very primordial

1582.77 --> 1587.48
concept time time is what the multiverse

1585.23 --> 1589.79
is based on so there is the energy for

1587.48 --> 1592.55
that and Mahakali has many aspects and

1589.79 --> 1594.59
like because time is not a similar thing

1592.55 --> 1596.0
as people think it to be it has various

1594.59 --> 1597.53
aspects so there will be all these

1596.0 --> 1599.63
different goddesses which represent

1597.53 --> 1602.48
different aspects of time that's why

1599.63 --> 1604.7900000000002
sport Maha Kali means great khali

1602.48 --> 1607.01
so it'll have like a bug alarm key it

1604.79 --> 1609.62
will have certain on the hearing so many

1607.01 --> 1611.93
goddesses which come under the banner of

1609.62 --> 1615.5
Mahakali itself son Smith what is called

1611.93 --> 1617.03
okay Carly time nothing to do with black

1615.5 --> 1619.61
or white

1617.03 --> 1621.53
skull she's grinning and everything it

1619.61 --> 1623.84
shows the various aspects of trying to

1621.53 --> 1625.28
achieve a spell with 12 that things

1623.84 --> 1627.9199999999998
which is like the 12 signs of the zodiac

1625.28 --> 1629.529
there are 12 division on the thesis you

1627.92 --> 1631.76
think we are

1629.529 --> 1635.059
made it means the color black or not

1631.76 --> 1636.83
okay so the word is for that is kala and

1635.059 --> 1638.51
what happens is in the West is like they

1636.83 --> 1642.559
put on automatically

1638.51 --> 1644.389
they put a sound on top of everything if

1642.559 --> 1646.76
you have the word ships which will be

1644.389 --> 1648.59
become Shiva in the West you have if you

1646.76 --> 1651.799
have Krishna Krishna becomes fish not

1648.59 --> 1653.6
Haram becomes Rama but but incense with

1651.799 --> 1655.6689999999999
what happens is if you use the word tall

1653.6 --> 1657.559
that's different if you use the word

1655.669 --> 1659.3600000000001
kala they are two different things if I

1657.559 --> 1661.85
go into Kali I can tell thousand things

1659.36 --> 1663.62
about that whatever information is they

1661.85 --> 1666.4399999999998
don't Google I am trying to say

1663.62 --> 1668.7199999999998
Karlis time and kala is back okay let's

1666.44 --> 1671.659
be clear about that it's not kala which

1668.72 --> 1673.76
is time Carl is time because the root of

1671.659 --> 1676.88
the words in Sanskrit and what they mean

1673.76 --> 1680.269
here is so much misinformation online

1676.88 --> 1682.46
about in Sanskrit alphabet like like in

1680.269 --> 1685.22
English you have a PCB okay like in that

1682.46 --> 1688.6100000000001
same way Sanskrit as like alphabet B

1685.22 --> 1690.019
starts with curved actually the Sanskrit

1688.61 --> 1694.82
alphabet start with ker it has 50

1690.019 --> 1697.88
letters in total okay English has 26 so

1694.82 --> 1699.32
it has 50 letters all those individual

1697.88 --> 1701.69
letters have their own sounds and

1699.32 --> 1704.36
meanings and then Sanskrit is a

1701.69 --> 1706.8200000000002
combination of those meanings like I'm

1704.36 --> 1708.4089999999999
taking it from that level only some

1706.82 --> 1709.97
level I mean that way in the same way in

1708.409 --> 1712.0100000000002
English also like if you break down any

1709.97 --> 1713.929
word for example if you break down the

1712.01 --> 1715.61
word physics in English even if you go

1713.929 --> 1717.529
to a university and you ask a physics

1715.61 --> 1718.61
professor like what is physics I mean

1717.529 --> 1720.32
they will not be able to tell from the

1718.61 --> 1722.1789999999999
word physics means that is what the

1720.32 --> 1725.99
situation is in English even but physics

1722.179 --> 1728.24
comes from five thi s ICS okay the words

1725.99 --> 1730.429
Phi comes from Phi ratio golden ratio

1728.24 --> 1732.2
six comes from cutting the cutting

1730.429 --> 1734.21
cutting up of Phi ratios that word

1732.2 --> 1735.799
physics leap cutting above five will

1734.21 --> 1738.1100000000001
show essence is that's how nature

1735.799 --> 1740.36
functions the ordination nature

1738.11 --> 1743.33
functions on fire ratio so I mean which

1740.36 --> 1745.6299999999999
is called golden ratio so I mean that's

1743.33 --> 1748.399
that way all words in every language

1745.63 --> 1752.269
have their real meanings which are not

1748.399 --> 1754.07
known or are not told like I mean like

1752.269 --> 1754.909
even the Oxford Dictionary which is not

1754.07 --> 1757.809
gonna tell you anything about that

1754.909 --> 1761.6290000000001
because it's just ox means earth and

1757.809 --> 1762.92
food means broad ok Old English for

1761.629 --> 1766.58
names fraud

1762.92 --> 1770.03
art fraud is art fraud dictionary

1766.58 --> 1772.6399999999999
Webster's creating a web oxford

1770.03 --> 1774.8
dictionary okay that's English even like

1772.64 --> 1777.74
even though land English language comes

1774.8 --> 1779.6599999999999
from the same Sanskrit root all of them

1777.74 --> 1783.05
because it is just a part of it 26

1779.66 --> 1785.18
alphabets no soft these no softies it is

1783.05 --> 1787.04
part of that even the Egyptian like I'll

1785.18 --> 1788.3300000000002
tell you the similarities I mean it like

1787.04 --> 1791.96
there was Rama in Sanskrit

1788.33 --> 1794.6899999999998
there is LA Kings in Egypt they called

1791.96 --> 1797.18
ROM is the same thing whether you say

1794.69 --> 1799.22
ROM or you say da there are and use the

1797.18 --> 1800.69
word ra4 son is the same thing which is

1799.22 --> 1802.88
continuing from the way they to Egyptian

1800.69 --> 1807.14
to English and I mean English is pretty

1802.88 --> 1809.1200000000001
much Egyptian and Sanskrit only the

1807.14 --> 1812.0
language actually I mean the word

1809.12 --> 1813.8899999999999
language means langauge actually you

1812.0 --> 1816.11
gauge the land it programs you like

1813.89 --> 1817.2800000000002
every time you speak it programs you no

1816.11 --> 1818.54
matter what language you speak you have

1817.28 --> 1819.95
to speak from the center of your mouth

1818.54 --> 1823.43
which is called centering which is

1819.95 --> 1825.74
called medium Medi in Latin which is

1823.43 --> 1828.0800000000002
Medi means center like that's what

1825.74 --> 1829.7
becomes the word meditation when you

1828.08 --> 1831.05
Center and you speak from the center and

1829.7 --> 1833.0
you always stay in the center no matter

1831.05 --> 1836.96
what the language you are always

1833.0 --> 1838.79
meditating okay so I mean like that way

1836.96 --> 1840.1100000000001
if you use words in every language we

1838.79 --> 1842.3
have to still understand what they

1840.11 --> 1844.8799999999999
actually mean the basics of it from the

1842.3 --> 1847.9099999999999
very core level from the basic sound

1844.88 --> 1850.2800000000002
levels like and the word are like in

1847.91 --> 1852.8600000000001
English also it is written like are like

1850.28 --> 1855.41
which is like a rotation in Sanskrit the

1852.86 --> 1857.33
letters are like this only like it's a

1855.41 --> 1860.0
rotation even in pictograph achill form

1857.33 --> 1862.04
so like and what that rotation is it's

1860.0 --> 1865.28
rotation from matter to energy and

1862.04 --> 1867.76
energy to matter and that's what the Sun

1865.28 --> 1870.11
does that's why it's called drop like I

1867.76 --> 1872.09
mean we can go on and on about this but

1870.11 --> 1873.9799999999998
I'm just trying to get BR on the same

1872.09 --> 1875.54
page about this that we have to go to

1873.98 --> 1877.85
the basic who's not the Sanskrit but in

1875.54 --> 1880.1
any language we absorb any doubt all up

1877.85 --> 1884.09
man and I just want to say thank you

1880.1 --> 1887.03
again for coming here and sharing your

1884.09 --> 1889.04
wealth of information with us the Shakti

1887.03 --> 1890.75
is there all the time whether the

1889.04 --> 1892.9099999999999
multiverse is in creation or not in

1890.75 --> 1895.61
creation Shakti stays so it doesn't have

1892.91 --> 1896.65
any time so it can't be dated or

1895.61 --> 1899.86
predated

1896.65 --> 1901.51
all black is not the same black ma you

1899.86 --> 1902.77
can have black with certain level of

1901.51 --> 1904.24
codons and then you can have a black

1902.77 --> 1907.45
with much more Lawrence and much more

1904.24 --> 1910.78
infinity which is more fine knit ratio

1907.45 --> 1914.0800000000002
okay so that's Shakti in its infinite

1910.78 --> 1917.1399999999999
form infinite form is always there

1914.08 --> 1919.57
that's called Shakti now there various

1917.14 --> 1923.2
aspects of Shakti like goddess Kali is

1919.57 --> 1925.4199999999998
one aspect of it okay its aspect but the

1923.2 --> 1928.24
the blanket term if you want to use it

1925.42 --> 1932.22
will be Shakti for that get who created

1928.24 --> 1936.79
this geometry and very misogynistic

1932.22 --> 1941.04
mahashiv mahalakshmi mahasaraswati and

1936.79 --> 1943.48
Maha Kali they that is the goddess to me

1941.04 --> 1945.79
you can put the hole all the planes

1943.48 --> 1948.04
putting planes in a form of a tree world

1945.79 --> 1950.62
to me you can call it because it has an

1948.04 --> 1953.47
axis it has a pool so you can put that

1950.62 --> 1955.51
in that form it's one of the formats you

1953.47 --> 1958.3600000000001
can put it it you make but that is

1955.51 --> 1962.3799999999999
obviously a manifestation of rugby is it

1958.36 --> 1964.9599999999998
our girls who climb higher this tree

1962.38 --> 1966.6100000000001
through obviously because that is

1964.96 --> 1969.7
depends upon what you want like if you

1966.61 --> 1971.8899999999999
want no pain no torture or everything

1969.7 --> 1974.38
good everything nice no problems

1971.89 --> 1976.8400000000001
none of this tension none of this that

1974.38 --> 1979.23
thing then you want to my plan reduces

1976.84 --> 1981.85
chair you mainly stick to the pants

1979.23 --> 1985.06
thick to the facts is very good I mean

1981.85 --> 1987.6999999999998
but in basics also facts a human being

1985.06 --> 1989.1399999999999
goes got to eat that's also a fact human

1987.7 --> 1990.97
being also has got to speak that's also

1989.14 --> 1993.46
a fact a human being has to become in

1990.97 --> 1995.71
all of these are facts to any being has

1993.46 --> 1997.1200000000001
to do these things either I mean the

1995.71 --> 1999.43
thing in the West is that there are no

1997.12 --> 2000.81
basics nobody wants to do basics nobody

1999.43 --> 2003.24
wants to do the family nobody wants to

2000.81 --> 2004.47
go into that like I mean I give you

2003.24 --> 2006.84
examples of different different things

2004.47 --> 2009.03
like you know like the watch and sounds

2006.84 --> 2011.1899999999998
what you put into your ear and what you

2009.03 --> 2013.35
make and all these things everything

2011.19 --> 2015.24
makes her like this is of these from the

2013.35 --> 2018.54
basics even the Earth or the Tao

2015.24 --> 2020.13
connecting with nature is also a basic I

2018.54 --> 2022.05
mean if you people don't take care of

2020.13 --> 2024.96
the basics I mean flat earth versus the

2022.05 --> 2027.03
pointer which gives earth its proper

2024.96 --> 2028.6200000000001
position in the theory they have given

2027.03 --> 2030.54
like when earth was spinning around the

2028.62 --> 2032.28
Sun in the solar system and

2030.54 --> 2033.99
solar system was going around the center

2032.28 --> 2036.09
of the Milky Way it was is a meaningless

2033.99 --> 2037.83
speck in their system in the weather

2036.09 --> 2040.4399999999998
cosmology and in the real flatter thing

2037.83 --> 2042.6
it is stationary it's flat it's a plane

2040.44 --> 2046.0800000000002
it is right in the center of multiverse

2042.6 --> 2049.3199999999997
which gives earth its proper position we

2046.08 --> 2051.929
can go up to higher planes or down to

2049.32 --> 2054.48
lower planes if we go to the North Pole

2051.929 --> 2056.85
right now will we be able to physically

2054.48 --> 2057.48
access different planes from the North

2056.85 --> 2060.33
Pole

2057.48 --> 2062.4
no no one can't one can't do it it has

2060.33 --> 2064.14
to be spinach you know that a lot of

2062.4 --> 2066.06
people are trying to do that like

2064.14 --> 2068.64
there's a whole movement which is

2066.06 --> 2070.29
happening people are people holding

2068.64 --> 2073.83
that's where the whole thing about the

2070.29 --> 2076.169
West comes in that like no importance is

2073.83 --> 2078.33
given to the basics the thing with the

2076.169 --> 2081.66
North Pole is that if you go towards the

2078.33 --> 2083.8199999999997
center you know and in order to access

2081.66 --> 2086.94
higher realms one has to happens energy

2083.82 --> 2089.1000000000004
right one has to be prepared to be

2086.94 --> 2091.8
accepted into those realms

2089.1 --> 2093.81
one can't force the way in if it was a

2091.8 --> 2095.2200000000003
matter of forcing your way in then all

2093.81 --> 2096.929
the governments and everybody was would

2095.22 --> 2099.0
have gone there already and trying to

2096.929 --> 2102.06
force their way in they they have all

2099.0 --> 2104.91
the resources to go to North Pole and go

2102.06 --> 2107.19
in there but they still don't because it

2104.91 --> 2109.3799999999997
doesn't work like that I mean it's not

2107.19 --> 2111.39
just a matter of just packing your bags

2109.38 --> 2112.8900000000003
and going there and things will work out

2111.39 --> 2114.54
and you go higher that's not how it

2112.89 --> 2116.46
works one has to be ready one has to be

2114.54 --> 2117.57
fit enough for higher place one has to

2116.46 --> 2120.3
have done the basics one has to have

2117.57 --> 2123.86
understood what it takes to be there who

2120.3 --> 2126.48
exists in those things hey this was

2123.86 --> 2129.06
these different planes that we're

2126.48 --> 2131.79
talking about do they go up and up and

2129.06 --> 2133.7999999999997
up forever two different planes and down

2131.79 --> 2136.86
and down and down forever is there a

2133.8 --> 2138.9
limit to him uh it is a limit there is a

2136.86 --> 2142.35
limit so when you reach the very very

2138.9 --> 2146.2200000000003
top top top plane what is that like and

2142.35 --> 2149.7
that will be like a way of there would

2146.22 --> 2152.79
be like millions of years on earth first

2149.7 --> 2155.16
a day there and that is like very subtle

2152.79 --> 2158.67
realm that's like high energy high I

2155.16 --> 2160.47
mean that is like power in its purest

2158.67 --> 2162.3
form every call all the good things

2160.47 --> 2163.79
which you call peace and love like

2162.3 --> 2166.79
properly deal

2163.79 --> 2168.95
thing fully like fully expressed in all

2166.79 --> 2171.35
times in all things without any

2168.95 --> 2174.56
corruption or any kind of like it's like

2171.35 --> 2177.35
an immediate call and response yes so

2174.56 --> 2180.41
now let me ask you when you go all the

2177.35 --> 2184.8199999999997
way down to the very very bottom plane

2180.41 --> 2186.5299999999997
what is that yeah that is also doesn't

2184.82 --> 2189.2000000000003
mean any kind of disease or doesn't mean

2186.53 --> 2192.44
any kind of badness it just moved

2189.2 --> 2195.7999999999997
gross it just gets more vibrationally

2192.44 --> 2196.58
thicker that's all it's not help okay

2195.8 --> 2198.6800000000003
got you

2196.58 --> 2201.38
bodies exist in all planes you have a

2198.68 --> 2203.48
body in all planes okay so we have a

2201.38 --> 2206.03
body in our planes it's that's

2203.48 --> 2207.92
interesting yeah um yeah they are inside

2206.03 --> 2209.51
your body like I mean other bodies right

2207.92 --> 2211.73
now exist inside your physical body like

2209.51 --> 2213.6800000000003
Russian dolls like $1 and they the other

2211.73 --> 2215.75
dolls are all inside so when this

2213.68 --> 2217.46
physical body comes off like then all

2215.75 --> 2219.26
the other bodies come out together and

2217.46 --> 2220.88
there is the one something on it

2219.26 --> 2222.6800000000003
physical bodies like a cloth when that

2220.88 --> 2225.11
clock comes off the other bodies will

2222.68 --> 2227.06
come out the motive is going to come out

2225.11 --> 2228.23
will still feel pain and pleasure and

2227.06 --> 2230.7799999999997
all of that people think something

2228.23 --> 2233.2400000000002
changes at the moment of leaving that it

2230.78 --> 2234.71
does nothing changes actually in the way

2233.24 --> 2236.5099999999998
that there is no difference between

2234.71 --> 2238.66
physical and spiritual grace it doesn't

2236.51 --> 2241.3100000000004
have any kind of schizophrenia in

2238.66 --> 2242.93
anything there is no material spiritual

2241.31 --> 2244.7
material and spiritual are the same

2242.93 --> 2248.0499999999997
thing shrink rotation where is

2244.7 --> 2252.2
syncretism to you syncretism to mean is

2248.05 --> 2255.4700000000003
combining up of all of the energies in a

2252.2 --> 2257.93
holistic way you say that there was a

2255.47 --> 2261.08
time where everything was perfect and we

2257.93 --> 2265.3999999999996
was balanced in harmony how it all

2261.08 --> 2268.58
started going downhill and now we need

2265.4 --> 2270.9500000000003
governments that exploit us one theory

2268.58 --> 2273.71
is that it started with hunting the

2270.95 --> 2278.7799999999997
animals I want to know if you agree with

2273.71 --> 2280.16
that and what okay okay I mean I find

2278.78 --> 2281.96
that all of those things are side

2280.16 --> 2283.97
results hunting the animals and all of

2281.96 --> 2286.04
that is the side result of the

2283.97 --> 2288.6499999999996
perversion prohibition comes before

2286.04 --> 2290.18
hunting and stuff happens later the main

2288.65 --> 2292.64
perversion the very first perversion

2290.18 --> 2296.81
according to with Vedic thing happened

2292.64 --> 2297.95
when beans actually rebelled against the

2296.81 --> 2299.569
higher Oh

2297.95 --> 2304.1899999999996
like there was a beanpole Dutch for

2299.569 --> 2307.7
example he went against ships and ship

2304.19 --> 2311.059
was actually had more power than him but

2307.7 --> 2314.029
he just went against them thinking that

2311.059 --> 2317.0890000000004
he had more in the money was the rule is

2314.029 --> 2318.74
that like you will not take any kind of

2317.089 --> 2321.589
that thing with the higher the who is a

2318.74 --> 2325.069
PDS to the higher always you don't

2321.589 --> 2327.38
confront the higher when you do that

2325.069 --> 2329.779
then you break that law and after that

2327.38 --> 2332.329
many things happen and then you fall

2329.779 --> 2333.89
down and then your energy gets scrambled

2332.329 --> 2336.2000000000003
and then you start doing nonsensical

2333.89 --> 2338.5989999999997
things killing the animals and all of

2336.2 --> 2340.7
that that perversion comes later so the

2338.599 --> 2343.369
basic thing is like a more egoic thing

2340.7 --> 2345.47
which is the problem point which happens

2343.369 --> 2348.6800000000003
the multiverse when ego blinds them to

2345.47 --> 2351.14
the reality of bortles at any given

2348.68 --> 2353.48
point of time that sense of ego that is

2351.14 --> 2355.19
the problem all the stories always show

2353.48 --> 2357.91
that as the problem like even the

2355.19 --> 2360.829
so-called demons who are trying to fight

2357.91 --> 2362.089
Durga or Kali they were doing it just

2360.829 --> 2364.759
because they thought they had the power

2362.089 --> 2367.16
to fight peace Horace's okay do you

2364.759 --> 2369.7690000000002
believe in one divine creator that

2367.16 --> 2373.7
created everything or plural

2369.769 --> 2377.299
there are many even that one has so many

2373.7 --> 2379.64
aspects like instance if you use one

2377.299 --> 2381.71
name there are thousand names of the one

2379.64 --> 2383.93
thing so each name gives a different

2381.71 --> 2386.15
aspect to the whole thing so they are

2383.93 --> 2387.95
the actual qualities when in Islam you

2386.15 --> 2389.329
say Allah if you ask anything Islam

2387.95 --> 2390.95
person they'll say praise be to Allah

2389.329 --> 2392.509
but how do you praise Allah when you

2390.95 --> 2394.6699999999996
don't know anything about Allah what are

2392.509 --> 2396.319
its qualities anything which does

2394.67 --> 2398.599
something has to have qualities these

2396.319 --> 2400.609
qualities are actual aspects of a being

2398.599 --> 2401.989
and you have to know about those exact

2400.609 --> 2403.13
qualities just like in science you have

2401.989 --> 2405.259
to know about different energies like

2403.13 --> 2406.549
literally magnetism all these things are

2405.259 --> 2408.41
separate things like so you have to

2406.549 --> 2410.299
understand each quality properly and you

2408.41 --> 2412.009
are to like celebrate it you have to

2410.299 --> 2414.589
praise it if somebody has to praise

2412.009 --> 2417.17
Mahakali then you have to praise all of

2414.589 --> 2419.15
her aspects and all of her energies and

2417.17 --> 2421.369
everything you have to be able to tell

2419.15 --> 2424.09
what they are you have to be able to

2421.369 --> 2425.8
recognize them and cognize them

2424.09 --> 2428.6200000000003
in the reading thing says when you place

2425.8 --> 2431.65
your pacing those things inside you they

2428.62 --> 2434.02
are not outside of it in the West

2431.65 --> 2435.34
they've turned into brain ok pray and

2434.02 --> 2437.29
praise a totally different things pray

2435.34 --> 2438.9700000000003
is the short form of praise then you

2437.29 --> 2442.5099999999998
love okay you're praising it only

2438.97 --> 2446.4399999999996
actually I think that the way our earth

2442.51 --> 2449.6800000000003
and our cosmos is made is awesome when I

2446.44 --> 2452.68
start looking at the ancient designs of

2449.68 --> 2454.8399999999997
the ancient Flat Earth cosmology I say

2452.68 --> 2457.2999999999997
man this is a beautiful earth we live

2454.84 --> 2460.3
and our ancestors when they thought

2457.3 --> 2463.98
about the cosmos also went as far as to

2460.3 --> 2463.98
personify the cosmos

2464.19 --> 2473.39
do you see the cosmological parallel

2468.72 --> 2476.0099999999998
between mama Carly and the earth cosmos

2473.39 --> 2477.69
obviously I mean it continues separated

2476.01 --> 2480.51
I mean they very kindly no separation I

2477.69 --> 2484.14
mean those aspects of divine energies

2480.51 --> 2486.9
will be there in the earth makeup and

2484.14 --> 2488.64
Earth's cosmology and the whole planet

2486.9 --> 2491.13
Earth from cosmology I mean from the top

2488.64 --> 2493.1099999999997
to the bottom everything has to be on

2491.13 --> 2496.11
the base on the same aspect same

2493.11 --> 2498.2400000000002
principles like as above so below as

2496.11 --> 2499.83
inside so outside look at the stars

2498.24 --> 2502.2299999999996
outside all of them like in the night

2499.83 --> 2503.91
sky okay if I'm seeing all these stars

2502.23 --> 2506.61
outside I mean those stars are inside me

2503.91 --> 2509.25
first then they are outside of out

2506.61 --> 2512.07
afterwards okay that was really good he

2509.25 --> 2515.1
said those stars are inside of him first

2512.07 --> 2517.6800000000003
in slightly it's outside that that right

2515.1 --> 2520.2
there just made the stars inside of me

2517.68 --> 2522.8399999999997
light up actually get it to get in touch

2520.2 --> 2527.0099999999998
with it to get the reality of it and

2522.84 --> 2528.78
that is the work actually that's why I

2527.01 --> 2530.34
was saying to you like I mean I am ready

2528.78 --> 2531.96
to and do anything like they can go to

2530.34 --> 2533.4300000000003
any place and a continent anywhere

2531.96 --> 2535.38
America or Australia or anywhere and

2533.43 --> 2537.0899999999997
they can say a heart is gonna do this

2535.38 --> 2538.32
and I on say I'm gonna do that and give

2537.09 --> 2539.82
you the weather what will do whether

2538.32 --> 2541.8
what I'm saying it will happen or what

2539.82 --> 2543.81
Hawk says will happen okay I'm ready to

2541.8 --> 2544.9500000000003
do this battle with anything any

2543.81 --> 2545.67
technology which they have on earth

2544.95 --> 2547.3199999999997
right now

2545.67 --> 2548.9700000000003
the inside is much more powerful than

2547.32 --> 2550.6200000000003
anything they have on the outside people

2548.97 --> 2552.6899999999996
are so worried about all these things

2550.62 --> 2553.98
right now like all this came trails and

2552.69 --> 2556.29
all of this thing I mean they don't

2553.98 --> 2559.2
understand it inside you have much more

2556.29 --> 2561.27
power than life this is nothing what are

2559.2 --> 2564.7799999999997
this happening without say when I tell

2561.27 --> 2567.6
you that he is wise very wise in the

2564.78 --> 2570.3900000000003
world today everybody worship a male God

2567.6 --> 2572.79
but the burner I'll research history I

2570.39 --> 2575.1
see that the ancients all had mother

2572.79 --> 2576.29
goddesses don't you think it's important

2575.1 --> 2579.15
that we go back to the ancient

2576.29 --> 2581.73
matriarchal mother nature mother goddess

2579.15 --> 2583.03
if anybody goes to my channel if anybody

2581.73 --> 2584.83
doesn't work on my channel

2583.03 --> 2586.96
that I have a thing called goddess sonic

2584.83 --> 2589.69
cake so I play sounds which are

2586.96 --> 2592.2400000000002
corresponding sign I put more than 200

2589.69 --> 2594.79
300 films out there with sounds which

2592.24 --> 2596.3799999999997
are based on that first chorus on in

2594.79 --> 2598.75
cycle then the thing is that what has

2596.38 --> 2602.11
happened is goddess was there always

2598.75 --> 2604.15
they just hit it a little bit okay like

2602.11 --> 2606.19
in like insanity they even had to make

2604.15 --> 2608.9500000000003
they hit it has made they have this time

2606.19 --> 2611.02
being trying to hide it because they

2608.95 --> 2614.23
don't want people to have direct access

2611.02 --> 2617.14
to shut be an energy basically shut me

2614.23 --> 2619.84
because that will open up people to

2617.14 --> 2622.0899999999997
people will actually have power and then

2619.84 --> 2623.7400000000002
then be more such system they this

2622.09 --> 2625.77
system can't hold it there is obviously

2623.74 --> 2627.79
that fear and when when you were making

2625.77 --> 2629.32
deity which they haven't eternity is

2627.79 --> 2631.24
like the Jesus which is on the cross

2629.32 --> 2632.44
bleeding and dying and all of that you

2631.24 --> 2634.8399999999997
know that kind of thing creates a whole

2632.44 --> 2636.31
lot of funniness like whatever deities

2634.84 --> 2638.32
they make you worship like and said in

2636.31 --> 2639.82
Islam this for Allah but you know they

2638.32 --> 2641.92
can't tell what are lies actually they

2639.82 --> 2644.6800000000003
don't have any single word or like

2641.92 --> 2646.3
thinking about what this being is

2644.68 --> 2648.31
actually like they don't I mean that's

2646.3 --> 2650.0800000000004
way the Vedic thing has got thousands

2648.31 --> 2652.39
and thousands of energies qualities

2650.08 --> 2654.97
aspects about of all the eighties like

2652.39 --> 2657.0099999999998
in the feminine and masculine aspect

2654.97 --> 2658.18
both us and especially in the feminine

2657.01 --> 2660.07
aspect there's a whole thing called

2658.18 --> 2661.66
Shakti paths which liked our covers all

2660.07 --> 2663.79
of the goddesses in so many different

2661.66 --> 2665.3799999999997
ways I mean in Egypt also like you just

2663.79 --> 2669.46
see the goddess in two three ways like

2665.38 --> 2671.77
Isis like hot or North but there are so

2669.46 --> 2673.66
many more aspects to that leg you know

2671.77 --> 2675.73
no no mood was the sky goddess like an

2673.66 --> 2678.49
idiot for example which is a from from

2675.73 --> 2680.32
nonny moon a business move form is one

2678.49 --> 2682.39
form wave form is another which became

2680.32 --> 2683.98
Nexus but even necklace is also

2682.39 --> 2686.98
different forms Lilith is also different

2683.98 --> 2687.73
forms all these new form and the NA form

2686.98 --> 2689.32
was not covered

2687.73 --> 2690.85
if you smooth and you know net this

2689.32 --> 2693.1000000000004
you're still not going through all the

2690.85 --> 2694.18
states of the goddess so what I'm saying

2693.1 --> 2697.15
in the waiting there is more

2694.18 --> 2698.9199999999996
comprehensive coverage even through

2697.15 --> 2700.15
Callie's Ruth like you like Kali so then

2698.92 --> 2703.0
even go through college tour and you

2700.15 --> 2706.42
find so much fun things about let me say

2703.0 --> 2709.39
man a year also my brother I wanna make

2706.42 --> 2711.23
you doing a good job and I just want to

2709.39 --> 2713.66
say I want to give you some the laugh

2711.23 --> 2717.56
but but people in the chat room he said

2713.66 --> 2721.7
he liked it when you say ok ok they say

2717.56 --> 2724.58
they like that man that's that's the

2721.7 --> 2726.83
action is awesome man you sound like the

2724.58 --> 2728.359
Godfather I was pleased to come in

2726.83 --> 2730.1
because you have been going that vegan

2728.359 --> 2732.68
way and you have been going the flatter

2730.1 --> 2733.64
earth and I was very pleased about the

2732.68 --> 2735.47
direction you're taking because the

2733.64 --> 2738.7999999999997
would so-called black conscious

2735.47 --> 2740.4199999999996
community is not with you on it like

2738.8 --> 2742.9100000000003
even Bobby Hammett and stuff like they

2740.42 --> 2744.859
got towards the Vedic things to a

2742.91 --> 2746.6299999999997
certain extent but they didn't go fully

2744.859 --> 2748.85
into it different teachers in the past

2746.63 --> 2751.13
in that thing doing what to certain

2748.85 --> 2752.69
aspects of it but like just when they

2751.13 --> 2754.67
were about to get more into it till they

2752.69 --> 2756.619
I know something else happened or

2754.67 --> 2759.109
something was always going on like what

2756.619 --> 2760.94
you're doing is actually providing

2759.109 --> 2763.04
people are like a more broader

2760.94 --> 2763.67
perspective and you are sticking to your

2763.04 --> 2766.52
guns

2763.67 --> 2769.82
in the glass roof ladder which lot of

2766.52 --> 2771.619
other people like in the community are

2769.82 --> 2774.23
not doing you can just take that matter

2771.619 --> 2776.359
to basics now the good basics should

2774.23 --> 2778.22
become a big thing you know if you have

2776.359 --> 2781.0099999999998
covered the basics about being and

2778.22 --> 2782.6
actually like what is meditation what is

2781.01 --> 2785.69
actually living what is the right diet

2782.6 --> 2786.98
how to live how to be that basics is the

2785.69 --> 2789.8
most important part once you know that

2786.98 --> 2791.75
is what is how to connect to earth how

2789.8 --> 2794.3
to connect to these energies all of that

2791.75 --> 2795.92
like to ground to actually stand on

2794.3 --> 2799.7000000000003
earth every day for five minutes without

2795.92 --> 2801.8
having any shoes or slippers okay things

2799.7 --> 2803.8999999999996
like that you know like the witch

2801.8 --> 2806.4500000000003
commander basics you know like those

2803.9 --> 2808.28
things have to become the big thing then

2806.45 --> 2810.1699999999996
you will progress much faster even more

2808.28 --> 2811.6090000000004
and that is what other teachers didn't

2810.17 --> 2814.64
have earlier like they didn't have the

2811.609 --> 2816.65
discipline or the basics the discipline

2814.64 --> 2818.69
and basics are very important for you to

2816.65 --> 2821.0
be a student you have to be willing to

2818.69 --> 2823.609
be wrong at any given time so that she

2821.0 --> 2825.77
can be right I bet you I could turn

2823.609 --> 2827.72
Bobby he made it to a flat earther right

2825.77 --> 2830.03
now if he's honest but if he's not

2827.72 --> 2832.4599999999996
honest he don't argue where I'm saying

2830.03 --> 2833.869
which is really good because what has

2832.46 --> 2836.18
happened is lot of people have built up

2833.869 --> 2838.19
loss show these already on the basis of

2836.18 --> 2840.02
the other model now they have to break

2838.19 --> 2841.34
down all those theories because this

2840.02 --> 2843.47
will put all of them out of the water

2841.34 --> 2845.0
now like it's a whole structure they

2843.47 --> 2847.5499999999997
have to throw down completely

2845.0 --> 2849.14
because people got so into all the Star

2847.55 --> 2851.54
Wars and Star that thing is not written

2849.14 --> 2854.72
all of this that thing that people can

2851.54 --> 2857.33
not break down all of that structure to

2854.72 --> 2859.3399999999997
you know all this mind programming which

2857.33 --> 2861.23
has been done because a lot of the in

2859.34 --> 2863.15
literature that we reading comes from

2861.23 --> 2864.53
the same source like for example the

2863.15 --> 2866.27
Sumerian things were coming from

2864.53 --> 2868.6400000000003
zecharia sitchin and Zecharia Sitchin

2866.27 --> 2869.96
was a person which belongs to these

2868.64 --> 2872.0899999999997
people only what you call the government

2869.96 --> 2874.31
whenever he came up with all of that was

2872.09 --> 2875.53
based on those things only so like I

2874.31 --> 2877.73
mean there is so much misinformation

2875.53 --> 2879.6800000000003
which people are dealing with even in

2877.73 --> 2881.599
the Cooper community that that's why I'm

2879.68 --> 2883.2799999999997
saying in when you come down to basics

2881.599 --> 2884.3900000000003
there is nothing to like they can be

2883.28 --> 2886.67
nothing wrong about touching the earth

2884.39 --> 2888.3199999999997
for example you know like you have to

2886.67 --> 2890.119
get down to the like right height is

2888.32 --> 2891.56
right diet I mean coming touching that

2890.119 --> 2893.57
is touching the connecting with nature

2891.56 --> 2896.84
is connecting the nature which is Shakti

2893.57 --> 2899.54
again you know like so they can be like

2896.84 --> 2901.7000000000003
there can be no arguments about it from

2899.54 --> 2903.89
anybody like nobody can say that that is

2901.7 --> 2905.4199999999996
there is something wrong in that you

2903.89 --> 2909.2599999999998
know Owen or matter of belief it's a

2905.42 --> 2911.81
matter of actual doing because I got

2909.26 --> 2914.599
someone on a panel right now who's very

2911.81 --> 2918.32
versed invaded cosmology this is my

2914.599 --> 2920.48
message that the Dogon Kananga is has

2918.32 --> 2923.48
nothing to do with series why would the

2920.48 --> 2926.06
DOE girls be marching around with Sirius

2923.48 --> 2928.82
constellation on that Dogon heads get

2926.06 --> 2930.32
real I saw that like I'm just I looked

2928.82 --> 2932.57
at this whole thing and it is famous

2930.32 --> 2936.38
colleague that hands up and down both

2932.57 --> 2938.21
the forearms yes it was so you agree

2936.38 --> 2940.4300000000003
with me I'm just gonna make you a fun

2938.21 --> 2943.099
joke about the devil thing because in

2940.43 --> 2947.66
Sanskrit Shakti's called Devi

2943.099 --> 2949.4300000000003
okay baby so it's it's babies like the

2947.66 --> 2954.98
softy is not dead in English so it is a

2949.43 --> 2957.2799999999997
de bi in English okay so if you put de

2954.98 --> 2960.609
VI and put an L with what will you get

2957.28 --> 2960.6090000000004
the devil

2961.27 --> 2967.68
so all like even colleagues a baby so

2964.339 --> 2970.5
here is called Mahakali baby so

2967.68 --> 2973.2599999999998
okay so the name for goddess is Devi in

2970.5 --> 2978.54
Sanskrit and the same baby becomes devil

2973.26 --> 2980.28
in the West wow this is neat stuff you

2978.54 --> 2982.92
know what we got so much to learn from

2980.28 --> 2986.4500000000003
you and like I said make sure y'all

2982.92 --> 2986.4500000000003
subscribe to Lotus ocean

2989.18 --> 2994.0389999999998
yes I'm in the wrong key to cause the

2992.269 --> 2995.299
clips I mean that's why in the Bulworth

2994.039 --> 2996.8590000000004
model you can't really tell how the

2995.299 --> 2999.2889999999998
Eclipse is happened if you don't bring

2996.859 --> 3001.66
Rahu and Ketu into it which are the

2999.289 --> 3003.46
shadow there are 'has in Sanskrit in the

3001.66 --> 3005.41
Vedic Astrology you know when the moon

3003.46 --> 3006.94
all turned red turns red and stuff I

3005.41 --> 3009.67
mean that is not happening because of

3006.94 --> 3011.319
any shadow you can't turn red from a

3009.67 --> 3015.13
shadow like you know you have to have

3011.319 --> 3017.859
like a some sort of a screen coming and

3015.13 --> 3020.4100000000003
giving that tint to the moon you know

3017.859 --> 3021.759
and that's why in the in the Vedic

3020.41 --> 3023.859
mathematics in stuff like men when they

3021.759 --> 3025.749
used to like they could tell eclipses

3023.859 --> 3027.46
beforehand you know they just by the

3025.749 --> 3029.499
motions of Rahu and Ketu they could tell

3027.46 --> 3031.359
when eclipses will happen you know they

3029.499 --> 3034.779
could predict eclipses just like more

3031.359 --> 3036.609
like even then what modern science can

3034.779 --> 3038.619
can you know they could predict much

3036.609 --> 3038.89
more earlier you know for hundreds of

3038.619 --> 3040.9300000000003
years

3038.89 --> 3043.3289999999997
[ __ ] eclipses are gonna happen just by

3040.93 --> 3045.91
the Momo motions on these two bodies

3043.329 --> 3047.319
they have been various aspects to them I

3045.91 --> 3049.45
would suggest like I mean it's a very

3047.319 --> 3051.999
big topic like rowdy goods it's a very

3049.45 --> 3054.069
broad topic like they are actual shadows

3051.999 --> 3056.319
when it comes to the like physical

3054.069 --> 3058.509
covering but they have esoteric aspects

3056.319 --> 3059.799
to them like the cool do you mean the

3058.509 --> 3063.009
third eye they connect to all of those

3059.799 --> 3065.41
things so I didn't want to go into that

3063.009 --> 3067.15
just right now like it's like an English

3065.41 --> 3069.999
word because in English like that word

3067.15 --> 3071.559
is being used it's not just a shadow

3069.999 --> 3072.7889999999998
like you know like Suns have a shadow

3071.559 --> 3074.8590000000004
like when you're standing we have a

3072.789 --> 3077.3190000000004
shadow it's not a shadow like that in it

3074.859 --> 3080.65
in sense where this agraja just like any

3077.319 --> 3083.68
other girl okay what about reincarnation

3080.65 --> 3085.1800000000003
and afterlife the mean connection is

3083.68 --> 3087.19
real like so

3085.18 --> 3088.8089999999997
afterlife is whatever you have done in

3087.19 --> 3091.18
this life accordingly you get the

3088.809 --> 3093.539
alkalis like that is everything is

3091.18 --> 3095.89
depends on actions in this multiverse

3093.539 --> 3100.2990000000004
susan is supreme people can be

3095.89 --> 3102.16
reincarnated as like roaches and rats I

3100.299 --> 3104.529
mean that that is not bound to happen

3102.16 --> 3107.859
that easily or simply yeah but you can

3104.529 --> 3109.9
get lower birds or higher birds I mean

3107.859 --> 3112.269
both are possibility either way but

3109.9 --> 3114.46
usually no being and does that kind of

3112.269 --> 3117.16
actions that it will deserve that kind

3114.46 --> 3118.28
of thing immediately like who clearly

3117.16 --> 3121.87
does not how

3118.28 --> 3126.26
crop circles form our the man-made or

3121.87 --> 3128.5099999999998
some other beings only comes our crop

3126.26 --> 3129.92
circles there is nothing no no man can

3128.51 --> 3131.21
go out there and make that you know

3129.92 --> 3132.83
people can even make them on a piece of

3131.21 --> 3133.9700000000003
paper let alone meet them in a field I

3132.83 --> 3137.15
mean I've been dealing with them for ten

3133.97 --> 3139.64
years and they happen in an instant

3137.15 --> 3142.25
their messages here I mean like I would

3139.64 --> 3145.0099999999998
tell his people to have more than 200

3142.25 --> 3146.27
cents on them they should go and look

3145.01 --> 3148.6400000000003
there is the introduction film and

3146.27 --> 3151.04
there's all kinds of films yes so go

3148.64 --> 3154.16
ahead and subscribe to Lotus ocean he

3151.04 --> 3156.2599999999998
has a lot of videos on crop circles and

3154.16 --> 3159.5299999999997
the thing crop circles are like they are

3156.26 --> 3164.1800000000003
anything they are energy yantras mantras

3159.53 --> 3167.27
Tantra or mathematics sacred geometry it

3164.18 --> 3169.16
was to preserve them I mean the purpose

3167.27 --> 3171.17
is like first it's showing that there

3169.16 --> 3172.8199999999997
are other realms there are things there

3171.17 --> 3175.07
is not as physical people there's not as

3172.82 --> 3177.5
3d there is not just what they have been

3175.07 --> 3179.54
telling us you know kids are like a

3177.5 --> 3181.28
complete it is and it is something which

3179.54 --> 3185.5299999999997
you can actually see in the physical on

3181.28 --> 3188.03
earth but is paranormal as a same time

3185.53 --> 3189.6800000000003
it's normal and paranormal at the same

3188.03 --> 3191.09
time in the sense that everybody can go

3189.68 --> 3193.37
there nobody everybody can go into the

3191.09 --> 3196.1600000000003
popsicle walk in it people can see it

3193.37 --> 3199.0699999999997
people can it is real like it's like

3196.16 --> 3201.2599999999998
nobody can deny more like a stamp the

3199.07 --> 3203.1800000000003
other reality into this reality is there

3201.26 --> 3206.03
a way to retain all of the knowledge

3203.18 --> 3208.85
that you have from a previous life when

3206.03 --> 3211.9700000000003
you resurrect yes it's called coherence

3208.85 --> 3213.5299999999997
the the more coherent you are at the

3211.97 --> 3215.6
moment of death before the moment of

3213.53 --> 3218.2000000000003
death the more memory you can push

3215.6 --> 3221.0899999999997
through into the future so the word

3218.2 --> 3224.33
coherent means logical and consistent

3221.09 --> 3226.79
like everything a holistic or from all

3224.33 --> 3229.52
sides you doing a good job giving us the

3226.79 --> 3231.95
definition it actually means holism like

3229.52 --> 3235.07
like being whole like holy when you use

3231.95 --> 3238.85
the word bully hol Y to use ur w into it

3235.07 --> 3240.5
so it becomes WH o ly like like the more

3238.85 --> 3243.29
holistic something is connected from

3240.5 --> 3245.48
each side then it stays together and it

3243.29 --> 3247.13
is it's got a basis and it takes forward

3245.48 --> 3249.04
that's what coherence is like like

3247.13 --> 3253.51
having all cycling approved

3249.04 --> 3257.35
like from all sides not leaving any side

3253.51 --> 3261.13
that's what currencies okay do both Rahu

3257.35 --> 3263.35
and Ketu cause eclipses or just one look

3261.13 --> 3267.07
both of them Hey

3263.35 --> 3269.08
so what about sungazing sungazing is a

3267.07 --> 3270.31
good bit early in the morning or in the

3269.08 --> 3272.56
evening uh Sun is going down

3270.31 --> 3275.89
only at those two times it's beneficial

3272.56 --> 3278.08
okay all right how does the moon light

3275.89 --> 3280.6
up we know that it don't get its light

3278.08 --> 3282.8199999999997
from the Sun the moon is very strange

3280.6 --> 3283.15
can you give us a little secrets about

3282.82 --> 3286.2400000000002
it

3283.15 --> 3288.37
a moon is a sensitive native it is a lit

3286.24 --> 3290.2299999999996
up by the power of the goddess the lunar

3288.37 --> 3292.5099999999998
goddess known as Shakti

3290.23 --> 3295.78
no one want to talk about in a spiritual

3292.51 --> 3297.76
aspect that clearly exists so thank you

3295.78 --> 3298.8700000000003
again for joining us on yeah and one

3297.76 --> 3301.96
more thing I would like to add to that

3298.87 --> 3304.18
is that even with the moonlight okay one

3301.96 --> 3306.31
can look at its physical characteristics

3304.18 --> 3308.74
that it is cooling and it is different

3306.31 --> 3310.84
it has four totally different aspects

3308.74 --> 3312.2799999999997
from sunlight one can wood that and

3310.84 --> 3314.26
there is no harm at going to that and

3312.28 --> 3317.2900000000004
those are aspects and qualities which

3314.26 --> 3318.55
you can see on the physical level and at

3317.29 --> 3320.41
the same time you can have the spiritual

3318.55 --> 3321.88
aspect and the material aspect both at

3320.41 --> 3323.92
the same time so there's no need to

3321.88 --> 3324.52
create a gulf between the truth that's

3323.92 --> 3327.85
what I was

3324.52 --> 3330.82
one two hours and I want to say this has

3327.85 --> 3334.99
been an awesome show Lotus ocean I have

3330.82 --> 3337.21
so so so much respect for you because

3334.99 --> 3338.9799999999996
you spoke with Santos Bonacci he

3337.21 --> 3340.81
actually reached out the you for some

3338.98 --> 3343.78
information my channel is mostly

3340.81 --> 3345.64
sounding like mostly sound music and

3343.78 --> 3346.63
crop circles and things like that I mean

3345.64 --> 3349.54
even if I didn't have a single

3346.63 --> 3351.34
subscriber I mean I'll be doing what I'm

3349.54 --> 3353.5299999999997
doing anyways out there who me it

3351.34 --> 3355.2400000000002
doesn't matter like what subscriber who

3353.53 --> 3357.07
subscribe to bezel subscribe or anything

3355.24 --> 3358.8999999999996
like that the only thing I liked about

3357.07 --> 3361.15
you was that you were going in the right

3358.9 --> 3364.42
direction and you know it's added

3361.15 --> 3365.92
veganism and some basics actually

3364.42 --> 3367.6
bringing some basics into it and that's

3365.92 --> 3369.4
what I wanted to stress that more basics

3367.6 --> 3372.25
are required in the 2/3 community

3369.4 --> 3374.23
otherwise there will be no actual that

3372.25 --> 3375.05
thing like I look at it from outside as

3374.23 --> 3377.75
fond of you -

3375.05 --> 3379.88
see that that it hitting this plateau

3377.75 --> 3382.7
out and nothing like really moves

3379.88 --> 3385.13
forward so in that's what I wanted to

3382.7 --> 3390.97
reach out to people that they should get

3385.13 --> 3399.13
this temple primary is a huge shout out

3390.97 --> 3424.5499999999997
to Lotus ocean acknowledge Jesus Jesus

3399.13 --> 3427.82
in any way I mean Jesus before that and

3424.55 --> 3429.65
so maybe we want to take this if you

3427.82 --> 3433.19
look at it everything will be common

3429.65 --> 3437.06
American at some point at some level if

3433.19 --> 3440.33
you take the dogs back leg so so let me

3437.06 --> 3442.64
just thank you once again Lotus ocean

3440.33 --> 3444.77
for coming on to the show I will be

3442.64 --> 3446.6299999999997
sharing your channel I like your energy

3444.77 --> 3450.02
and I think you're very knowledgeable

3446.63 --> 3452.77
you someone just a personification of

3450.02 --> 3452.77
the Tree of Life

3463.35 --> 3465.98
