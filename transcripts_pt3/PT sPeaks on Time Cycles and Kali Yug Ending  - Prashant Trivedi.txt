6.09 --> 9.2
[Music]

10.08 --> 14.639
a guru for now an expert in vedic

12.719 --> 15.678999999999998
astrology and outer few books on that

14.639 --> 17.84
topic

15.679 --> 20.240000000000002
and we would like to discuss the topic

17.84 --> 23.119
of time so as krishna says in bhagavad

20.24 --> 25.119
gita in 1132 time i am

23.119 --> 26.56
so i would like to discuss with you raj

25.119 --> 29.759999999999998
today

26.56 --> 32.48
the topic of kali yug so the age of

29.76 --> 35.2
decline of coral and hypocrisy uh

32.48 --> 37.76
inspiration and beginning

35.2 --> 40.239000000000004
so we can start from the question on the

37.76 --> 42.0
beginning of kali yoga so because it's

40.239 --> 43.199999999999996
regularly assuring that the kalyan

42.0 --> 46.64
started

43.2 --> 48.800000000000004
35 years after kurukshetra battle which

46.64 --> 50.32
is discussed in mahakarat

48.8 --> 53.12
which will give us

50.32 --> 55.68
3102

53.12 --> 57.839999999999996
a year before the crisis so could you

55.68 --> 59.76
please comment on that is this timing of

57.84 --> 60.64
beginning correct

59.76 --> 61.44
right

60.64 --> 64.0
okay

61.44 --> 65.51899999999999
let's um go not like that like let's

64.0 --> 66.479
understand the cycles of time the first

65.519 --> 67.84
thing yeah

66.479 --> 69.84
because that's the best way rather than

67.84 --> 72.32000000000001
giving one that thing you know

69.84 --> 75.2
to understand what cycles are you know

72.32 --> 76.479
in if you look at any vedic texts

75.2 --> 78.96000000000001
okay the number you're going to find

76.479 --> 81.119
mostly is 12

78.96 --> 83.439
12 is like 12 signs

81.119 --> 85.6
you know the 12 signs of the zodiac okay

83.439 --> 87.75899999999999
you know which we everybody knows

85.6 --> 90.64
then these twelve signs have two

87.759 --> 92.07900000000001
thousand year cycle

90.64 --> 94.64
each each sign says for two thousand

92.079 --> 98.079
years uh which modern

94.64 --> 99.52
like as astronomy also confirms you know

98.079 --> 102.32
there's twenty four thousand a cycle so

99.52 --> 103.759
two thousand years for twelve signs

102.32 --> 105.36
twenty five thousand year cycle okay

103.759 --> 107.6
which is called the precession of the

105.36 --> 108.96
equinoxes okay like the

107.6 --> 110.24
the cycle which is twenty four thousand

108.96 --> 111.27999999999999
a cycle which is again multiple of

110.24 --> 113.119
twelve

111.28 --> 115.43900000000001
so half of that cycle is twelve 000

113.119 --> 116.479
years again

115.439 --> 118.88
so

116.479 --> 120.719
if actually look at vedic text you will

118.88 --> 123.119
find the number 12 000

120.719 --> 124.96
in the slokas

123.119 --> 127.92
but like in

124.96 --> 129.679
last i know under 200 years you know

127.92 --> 131.36
whatever people have gotten these big

129.679 --> 132.56
very big numbers

131.36 --> 135.84
yeah

132.56 --> 138.48
okay like 432 000 years yes

135.84 --> 140.64000000000001
millions years millions of years

138.48 --> 142.72
we have gotten very huge numbers yeah

140.64 --> 144.48
okay but in no weighted text you can

142.72 --> 145.76
actually find these numbers

144.48 --> 147.51999999999998
okay

145.76 --> 148.39999999999998
okay you will not show me a sanskrit

147.52 --> 151.04000000000002
slope

148.4 --> 154.0
where these numbers are there so where

151.04 --> 154.79999999999998
do they take this from then okay okay

154.0 --> 156.56
yeah

154.8 --> 159.28
and uh this is a big great big

156.56 --> 160.72
misconception all around so the whole

159.28 --> 161.84
plane right now that

160.72 --> 163.44
uh

161.84 --> 165.12
five thousand years have gone like you

163.44 --> 167.599
said as for them

165.12 --> 169.519
and uh four lakh twenty seven thousand

167.599 --> 172.319
which is four hundred twenty seven

169.519 --> 174.08
years are remaining

172.319 --> 175.11999999999998
okay which is funny in the first place

174.08 --> 177.36
because

175.12 --> 179.28
i don't think like any common sensical

177.36 --> 183.59900000000002
human or anybody can think that this can

179.28 --> 184.959
go on for another 400 000 years yeah

183.599 --> 188.0
you know

184.959 --> 188.8
can actually go on for that long

188.0 --> 190.4
like

188.8 --> 192.08
you even within 100 years people are

190.4 --> 195.12
thinking like this can't last another 50

192.08 --> 196.959
years even you know so

195.12 --> 198.879
it's not it's a very strange thing that

196.959 --> 200.48
people have been given that notion

198.879 --> 202.159
okay and uh which has created a lot of

200.48 --> 203.76
craziness then people

202.159 --> 205.44
have no urgency

203.76 --> 208.64
they think uh kali yug will last another

205.44 --> 209.519
for so what's the hurry

208.64 --> 210.95899999999997
let's

209.519 --> 213.12
slowly

210.959 --> 215.04
do things no there's no rush for

213.12 --> 216.72
anything you know

215.04 --> 218.79899999999998
but that number like i said was never

216.72 --> 221.2
there anywhere because

218.799 --> 223.44
what the slope was 12 000 years they

221.2 --> 224.39999999999998
used the word

223.44 --> 226.239
yes

224.4 --> 228.239
so which they considered them they used

226.239 --> 231.12
me divine ears

228.239 --> 233.519
okay which they thought like meant

231.12 --> 236.0
were like ear of the gods now ear of the

233.519 --> 239.12
gods which is the year of heaven

236.0 --> 240.56
is one it is equal to 360 human ears

239.12 --> 242.48000000000002
so you multiply everything but they

240.56 --> 243.36
multiply everything by 360.

242.48 --> 245.51899999999998
yeah

243.36 --> 247.04000000000002
if you multiply 12 000 by 360 you you

245.519 --> 248.64000000000001
are gonna get these kind of numbers 24

247.04 --> 250.07999999999998
000 multiplied by 360 you're going to

248.64 --> 251.2
get these

250.08 --> 252.31900000000002
numbers

251.2 --> 253.67999999999998
now

252.319 --> 256.4
the thing is

253.68 --> 257.6
where do you actually

256.4 --> 260.239
run by

257.6 --> 261.199
some other planes time scale on your

260.239 --> 263.919
plane

261.199 --> 265.91900000000004
why would you do that

263.919 --> 267.68
so we should not consider a year a year

265.919 --> 270.88
on earth we should consider

267.68 --> 270.88
360 years one year

271.12 --> 274.8
what they're saying you should consider

272.479 --> 275.84
360 years one year on earth that means

274.8 --> 277.91900000000004
sun should

275.84 --> 280.15999999999997
do this cycle which it does in a year a

277.919 --> 281.35999999999996
year is like a sun cycle right

280.16 --> 283.36
sun goes

281.36 --> 285.68
to the maximum then to the minimum and

283.36 --> 288.08000000000004
then maximum and that that's that's what

285.68 --> 289.84000000000003
sun does in a year okay that's the our

288.08 --> 291.68
area is defined by solar year the soul

289.84 --> 293.44
the sun's

291.68 --> 295.919
movement you know

293.44 --> 297.759
now they're saying 360 of those movement

295.919 --> 300.4
should constitute one year

297.759 --> 302.72
no but it won't be on earth plane this

300.4 --> 305.19899999999996
plane sun's movement as it is will be

302.72 --> 307.759
one year off here yeah

305.199 --> 309.039
you can't use the ears of

307.759 --> 311.759
gods

309.039 --> 314.15999999999997
and any marker four times

311.759 --> 316.639
going on here how that's

314.16 --> 318.88000000000005
makes no sense whatsoever but this

316.639 --> 321.12
nonsense was done

318.88 --> 322.0
yeah actually they could they compute

321.12 --> 323.36
the

322.0 --> 325.44
year the

323.36 --> 328.40000000000003
the length of the calpers based on the

325.44 --> 330.24
day of pragma so it's actually so that's

328.4 --> 331.75899999999996
probably the source of the

330.24 --> 333.039
misconception yeah

331.759 --> 334.88
yeah but no no but there's also the

333.039 --> 338.71999999999997
conception of for this yoga cycle is the

334.88 --> 342.08
word is it speaker 12 000

338.72 --> 343.52000000000004
but they have multiplied 12 000 by 360.

342.08 --> 346.71999999999997
but that they've done themselves it's

343.52 --> 346.71999999999997
not written in the slope to do that

347.039 --> 350.639
okay so i see now anything which happens

349.919 --> 352.56
in

350.639 --> 353.52
nature if you notice

352.56 --> 355.759
okay

353.52 --> 357.12
and nature doesn't function in the

355.759 --> 358.88
in that kind of way make sure everything

357.12 --> 362.639
is equal days is pretty much equal to

358.88 --> 363.759
night okay half up mostly equal

362.639 --> 365.919
okay

363.759 --> 367.199
okay all the four seasons if they happen

365.919 --> 368.96
then they they're equal three months

367.199 --> 371.52000000000004
three months three months

368.96 --> 373.52
okay so 24 000 here is the cycle

371.52 --> 376.0
so if you come to that thing actually

373.52 --> 378.79999999999995
then all the yogas

376.0 --> 378.8
will be equal too

379.6 --> 382.47900000000004
so it'll be around six

383.199 --> 386.319
right

384.16 --> 388.24
in that thing and

386.319 --> 389.759
the thing is that there are particular

388.24 --> 391.44
markers points

389.759 --> 393.199
for these yogurts

391.44 --> 395.6
like for example right now our pole star

393.199 --> 395.6
is group

396.08 --> 400.8
some other time pole star was vega

399.28 --> 401.919
another time porcha was an alpha

400.8 --> 402.88
draconis

401.919 --> 405.68
yeah

402.88 --> 406.639
and so pole star keeps on moving

405.68 --> 409.12
so when

406.639 --> 409.12
our pole

409.84 --> 414.23999999999995
then you are already on the cusp of the

412.16 --> 415.91900000000004
golden age

414.24 --> 418.479
okay

415.919 --> 420.56
that's the end of kali

418.479 --> 422.31899999999996
and the beginnings which is very clear

420.56 --> 424.88
because we are very well aligned with

422.319 --> 426.8
the pole star right

424.88 --> 428.479
our alignment with the star is quite

426.8 --> 430.88
strong which people can see in the night

428.479 --> 433.919
sky that all the stars are revolving

430.88 --> 435.52
around that pole star very clearly

433.919 --> 437.44
so the all the time periods were defined

435.52 --> 439.12
by these major stars so you will have

437.44 --> 440.479
four major stars

439.12 --> 443.52
and four points

440.479 --> 443.52
and four yoga changes

443.68 --> 448.84000000000003
based on that okay so that is very clear

446.72 --> 451.759
so right now we are at the cusp of that

448.84 --> 453.52
okay which makes sense as well because

451.759 --> 455.599
anyone who has any sense

453.52 --> 458.79999999999995
can tell that this cannot go on for

455.599 --> 458.8
another 400 000 years

462.08 --> 466.15999999999997
it's not

463.039 --> 467.44
feasible sustainable or anything yeah

466.16 --> 470.639
that's true

467.44 --> 472.96
yeah i mean even the biggest fool can

470.639 --> 474.8
actually see that with little bit of

472.96 --> 476.63899999999995
logic these numbers were just meant to

474.8 --> 477.759
create illusions in the mind of people

476.639 --> 479.44
yeah you know

477.759 --> 481.28000000000003
there's nothing to worry

479.44 --> 483.28
because things will carry on and we have

481.28 --> 484.79999999999995
another four thousand nothing needs to

483.28 --> 486.15999999999997
be done

484.8 --> 488.479
there can be no after and there'll be

486.16 --> 489.28000000000003
nothing you know like all of that

488.479 --> 492.479
you know

489.28 --> 493.84
which is falsifying

492.479 --> 496.24
okay basically

493.84 --> 499.11999999999995
and this 24 000 year cycle can be seen

496.24 --> 501.44
in everywhere like it's it's well known

499.12 --> 503.919
modern astronomy now also agrees with it

501.44 --> 506.24
everybody nobody can refute this cycle

503.919 --> 508.15999999999997
so it fits in well with the twelve signs

506.24 --> 510.96000000000004
two thousand years each fits and met

508.16 --> 512.9590000000001
with the yoga cycle

510.96 --> 513.8389999999999
it fits everywhere

512.959 --> 516.159
okay

513.839 --> 518.719
if there is nowhere it does not fit and

516.159 --> 520.88
if we take everything as sort of equal

518.719 --> 522.5600000000001
that is the way nature works

520.88 --> 524.32
okay our nature doesn't work in the

522.56 --> 525.279
ratio of four three to one

524.32 --> 527.6
yeah

525.279 --> 528.72
like around us even on earth plane at

527.6 --> 531.0400000000001
least

528.72 --> 533.9200000000001
we can see every year everything is

531.04 --> 534.8
four three two one ratio okay

533.92 --> 537.279
so

534.8 --> 540.0
so so that's that's very clear then you

537.279 --> 542.0
know the cycle is 24 000 years always

540.0 --> 543.2
and we are at the cusp

542.0 --> 544.72
of the end

543.2 --> 547.12
yeah

544.72 --> 548.9590000000001
of kali which is very clear you know

547.12 --> 551.36
because kali means

548.959 --> 553.4399999999999
ignorance right yeah

551.36 --> 555.44
and ignorance is lifting

553.44 --> 556.32
people are coming to know the truth so

555.44 --> 558.1600000000001
that's

556.32 --> 559.2
actually then where anyways

558.16 --> 560.7199999999999
you know

559.2 --> 562.32
there is no

560.72 --> 564.32
doubt about anything and this confusion

562.32 --> 566.72
which was created in india

564.32 --> 568.48
okay by a wrong understanding of the

566.72 --> 569.279
vedic texts

568.48 --> 571.6800000000001
yeah

569.279 --> 573.04
okay the brahmas kalpan stuff those are

571.68 --> 574.16
very huge numbers

573.04 --> 575.5999999999999
yeah

574.16 --> 578.24
those are huge numbers okay for

575.6 --> 579.6800000000001
brahmaloka you can apply those numbers

578.24 --> 581.839
for heaven

579.68 --> 583.519
you can apply local numbers

581.839 --> 585.0400000000001
but you can't apply those numbers on

583.519 --> 587.839
earth

585.04 --> 590.48
for earth cycles yeah because earth

587.839 --> 593.36
earth plane numbers will be applied

590.48 --> 595.44
because you have to go by our sun

593.36 --> 597.279
what it does whatever year is on earth

595.44 --> 598.6400000000001
is defined by us and they might have

597.279 --> 600.16
some other

598.64 --> 601.1999999999999
thing to define there

600.16 --> 602.88
out there

601.2 --> 605.9200000000001
yes that makes sense

602.88 --> 607.36
yes i mean okay and for us we have to

605.92 --> 608.959
define by that so we have to go by that

607.36 --> 610.8000000000001
and that is a cycle and that is the fact

608.959 --> 612.64
and that's the truth after that some

610.8 --> 614.3199999999999
people came to know it's 24 000 years

612.64 --> 615.6
then also some complications arose

614.32 --> 618.24
because people don't know how to divide

615.6 --> 619.6
it or what star means what

618.24 --> 621.36
which is the pulsar right now it's a

619.6 --> 623.12
very it's the

621.36 --> 623.92
very important start so

623.12 --> 626.16
like

623.92 --> 627.8389999999999
and what was the room about

626.16 --> 630.64
was about like aligning his will with

627.839 --> 633.9200000000001
the divine well right yes

630.64 --> 635.4399999999999
when we are aligned with that right now

633.92 --> 637.04
in that thing so then that will lead to

635.44 --> 638.32
that only

637.04 --> 640.56
right the whole group story is very

638.32 --> 642.72
clear in the vedic

640.56 --> 643.92
text no other proof even actually needs

642.72 --> 645.12
to be there

643.92 --> 647.519
except

645.12 --> 649.839
that we are aligned with the rooftop

647.519 --> 650.8
right now sudhir energy so what more do

649.839 --> 653.7600000000001
you need

650.8 --> 655.68
to know which age is going to happen and

653.76 --> 657.36
what transition is happening right now

655.68 --> 658.64
and whatever organizations which are

657.36 --> 660.5600000000001
spreading this

658.64 --> 662.88
big numbers fourth whole lakh thirty two

660.56 --> 664.64
or four and thirty two thousand or

662.88 --> 666.48
millions of years sort of thing

664.64 --> 668.399
uh it is their responsibility to change

666.48 --> 670.9590000000001
these numbers now

668.399 --> 672.16
because it is ridiculous

670.959 --> 675.04
to keep on

672.16 --> 675.8389999999999
giving this false knowledge to people

675.04 --> 677.68
yeah

675.839 --> 679.6800000000001
without any vedic

677.68 --> 681.519
textual proof or anything

679.68 --> 683.1999999999999
but when the sun goes

681.519 --> 684.64
into the northern

683.2 --> 685.6
transit

684.64 --> 687.68
it's called

685.6 --> 690.0
in sanskrit it's called the day of the

687.68 --> 690.0
gods

690.079 --> 694.7199999999999
in six months for us day of the gods and

692.959 --> 696.959
within six months it goes into the

694.72 --> 698.32
southern transit then it's called the

696.959 --> 700.8
night

698.32 --> 702.5600000000001
night of the gods yeah

700.8 --> 705.12
but these are cycles of here six months

702.56 --> 707.1999999999999
six months right yeah okay

705.12 --> 709.2
but we can't multiply all of those by

707.2 --> 711.0400000000001
360 as well just because the word is

709.2 --> 715.399
used

711.04 --> 715.399
or gods are mentioned or

715.48 --> 719.36
[Music]

717.839 --> 721.519
you know like so

719.36 --> 723.2
so it it it was a joke

721.519 --> 725.36
and it is a joke

723.2 --> 727.519
because uh only a person who will be

725.36 --> 729.36
feeling happy about this joke is kali

727.519 --> 730.9590000000001
the demon or whatever who is supposed to

729.36 --> 734.639
be lower who tell you

730.959 --> 734.6389999999999
you say like oh i've got another 400

735.2 --> 739.44
27 000 years to rule like 5000 years is

738.16 --> 741.279
not enough

739.44 --> 742.8800000000001
you know but people obviously know that

741.279 --> 744.079
you can't go any more longer than this

742.88 --> 745.68
because people are the ones who are

744.079 --> 746.399
facing the problems

745.68 --> 750.4799999999999
yeah

746.399 --> 750.48
i think literally has reached the bottom

754.079 --> 757.04
so

754.88 --> 758.72
any such number change we would think

757.04 --> 761.68
would have to come from the team of kali

758.72 --> 763.839
only not from anyone else

761.68 --> 765.68
so whosoever are

763.839 --> 767.2
spotting those numbers uh

765.68 --> 769.92
and uh promoting these numbers are all

767.2 --> 770.88
around the earth all around the

769.92 --> 772.639
plane

770.88 --> 775.04
they are the ones we can see whose side

772.639 --> 775.04
they are on

775.279 --> 780.639
do you know maybe who has introduced

776.8 --> 783.12
this literature so who has first did the

780.639 --> 784.48
who first hit the calculate wrong

783.12 --> 787.6
calculations

784.48 --> 789.6
so where's the

787.6 --> 792.16
we don't know exactly who did it

789.6 --> 793.9200000000001
but uh now everybody like iscon is using

792.16 --> 796.16
it yes

793.92 --> 797.92
um a lot of organizations are using it a

796.16 --> 799.36
lot of hindu and vedic organizations are

797.92 --> 801.36
using this number

799.36 --> 803.44
okay and it is a general prevalent theme

801.36 --> 804.639
all over india yeah that people think

803.44 --> 805.6800000000001
that is the case

804.639 --> 807.76
you know

805.68 --> 809.5999999999999
after that some people came along with

807.76 --> 810.959
their 24 000 years when people came to

809.6 --> 812.399
know about the precision of the konoxis

810.959 --> 815.04
and people came with that cycle which

812.399 --> 816.8
was there yeah which was always there

815.04 --> 818.3199999999999
you know and i've always talked about

816.8 --> 819.68
that cycle from the very beginning that

818.32 --> 821.839
that this

819.68 --> 823.68
year's cycle and there's 12 signs 2000

821.839 --> 825.7600000000001
years each like which i said the age of

823.68 --> 827.279
aquarius is starting because of that you

825.76 --> 829.519
know

827.279 --> 832.56
all of that which is

829.519 --> 835.04
yeah so but within the yoga cycle also

832.56 --> 837.4399999999999
we are on the cusp of ending of and it

835.04 --> 838.959
is already happening

837.44 --> 840.9590000000001
so

838.959 --> 843.1199999999999
since like last

840.959 --> 844.3199999999999
50 years and when the communications in

843.12 --> 845.68
our last 20 years especially when

844.32 --> 846.72
internet has come

845.68 --> 849.04
you know

846.72 --> 851.12
that darkness has been lifted from so

849.04 --> 853.04
many people all over the

851.12 --> 854.9590000000001
earth plane so the changes are happening

853.04 --> 857.279
you know people right now each year is

854.959 --> 859.279
tough for people you know like in this

857.279 --> 862.32
transition period and people are talking

859.279 --> 863.36
about 400 000 more of those

862.32 --> 864.72
yes

863.36 --> 867.36
is it

864.72 --> 868.8000000000001
when you know each year is

867.36 --> 869.76
tough enough for people you know it's

868.8 --> 871.8389999999999
not

869.76 --> 874.0
logical or anything i i want all these

871.839 --> 875.12
organizations to take notice

874.0 --> 876.72
and

875.12 --> 878.639
change

876.72 --> 881.44
their

878.639 --> 883.44
because this misconception

881.44 --> 885.6
is only creating more problems for

883.44 --> 888.1600000000001
people yeah you know for some people it

885.6 --> 889.44
creates uh like a sense of unease if

888.16 --> 890.88
khalid is going to go further along what

889.44 --> 892.8000000000001
will happen you know like

890.88 --> 895.279
and some people get disheartened some

892.8 --> 899.519
people get depressed yeah some people

895.279 --> 901.36
get like vm to do nothing you know now

899.519 --> 903.12
and it makes you comatose not a

901.36 --> 904.639
negativity which

903.12 --> 906.5600000000001
comes from this

904.639 --> 908.88
calculation you know

906.56 --> 910.88
and the quicker it's moved the better

908.88 --> 912.639
and the more the information gets out

910.88 --> 914.399
out there this is a misinterpretation of

912.639 --> 916.72
vedic texts

914.399 --> 918.48
and nowhere can you show me this figure

916.72 --> 920.5600000000001
i can show you the twelve thousand

918.48 --> 922.72
i'll show you the exact slow cover the

920.56 --> 924.4799999999999
twelve thousand written

922.72 --> 927.12
but they they have to show me the shloka

924.48 --> 927.12
with four hundred thirty

927.76 --> 930.88
would you maybe comment something on

929.199 --> 934.4799999999999
this because they also use this for

930.88 --> 935.8389999999999
calculations of beginning of kali

934.48 --> 937.04
and effects

935.839 --> 938.72
i think that those things have been just

937.04 --> 940.079
added to surround i don't think they

938.72 --> 942.24
were originally there like once they

940.079 --> 944.2399999999999
miscalculated this thing and they use

942.24 --> 945.92
the same calculations instead of

944.24 --> 946.8
afterwards like the same people who did

945.92 --> 949.279
that

946.8 --> 951.8389999999999
would do that you know because they have

949.279 --> 953.36
both the text and they and uh actually

951.839 --> 954.8800000000001
calculation text

953.36 --> 957.839
you know because all the calculations

954.88 --> 959.92
from that which were don't use this 360.

957.839 --> 961.2790000000001
like uh eclipses

959.92 --> 963.4399999999999
or

961.279 --> 965.04
like the motion of the grahas

963.44 --> 967.0400000000001
you know and their degrees and

965.04 --> 968.959
everything through the science all of

967.04 --> 970.56
those work but none of that this 360 is

968.959 --> 972.3199999999999
never used for that right as far as

970.56 --> 974.88
solar system is concerned for me like as

972.32 --> 977.9200000000001
long as the all the jotish calculations

974.88 --> 981.4399999999999
which work for it astronomically

977.92 --> 983.36
it's sound there that's fine

981.44 --> 984.8800000000001
but none of that involves this 360

983.36 --> 988.48
multiplication

984.88 --> 989.8389999999999
[Music]

988.48 --> 991.6800000000001
yeah so

989.839 --> 992.9590000000001
that that match is okay for me and this

991.68 --> 994.88
match is not

992.959 --> 997.5189999999999
and i'm very clear about it so it can't

994.88 --> 1000.639
be more clearer so i can show the 12 000

997.519 --> 1003.44
sloka it's there it's very clear but you

1000.639 --> 1004.639
know that number mentioned and but not

1003.44 --> 1005.9200000000001
for

1004.639 --> 1008.32
32

1005.92 --> 1010.9
000 you know in the vedic

1008.32 --> 1015.49
yes that's very good news

1010.9 --> 1015.49
[Music]

1015.6 --> 1018.9590000000001
so that's that that's that and i think

1017.839 --> 1020.639
these organizations hold the

1018.959 --> 1022.88
responsibility now for spreading

1020.639 --> 1024.64
misinformation and they have to correct

1022.88 --> 1027.12
themselves

1024.64 --> 1028.24
because otherwise the judgment will fall

1027.12 --> 1029.76
on them too

1028.24 --> 1030.64
for doing this

1029.76 --> 1032.799
yes

1030.64 --> 1036.1200000000001
yes

1032.799 --> 1036.12
i got it

1036.18 --> 1054.91
[Music]

1064.16 --> 1067.16
okay

1068.04 --> 1095.79
[Music]

1097.36 --> 1099.4399999999998
you
