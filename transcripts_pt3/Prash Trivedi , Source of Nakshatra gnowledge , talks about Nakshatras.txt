0.03 --> 5.16
when I started studying nakshatras that

3.06 --> 7.290000000000001
was way back three years ago I kind of

5.16 --> 9.9
scanned all the literature that was

7.29 --> 12.509
available in English at that time and I

9.9 --> 14.759
must have reviewed you know many many

12.509 --> 16.77
books you know after reading most of

14.759 --> 18.990000000000002
those books I almost gave up on my study

16.77 --> 21.09
and then finally what happened as

18.99 --> 23.339999999999996
someone suggested me this book or

21.09 --> 26.189
nakshatras and when I started reading

23.34 --> 27.990000000000002
this book I was slowly able to

26.189 --> 30.92
understand the essence of Michell's

27.99 --> 33.66
resist It was as though I I was

30.92 --> 36.300000000000004
connected with this author I never had a

33.66 --> 38.76
chance to meet this author

36.3 --> 42.29
I never correspond it with him I never

38.76 --> 44.129
interacted with him and in all the

42.29 --> 46.23
luxury courses that I've been teaching

44.129 --> 48.599999999999994
over the last one and a half years I

46.23 --> 52.68
have referred to him as made one Achaia

48.6 --> 57.21
and I am thus a Columbia so our girl

52.68 --> 59.789
yesterday needs no introduction right so

57.21 --> 64.379
please help me welcome brush through a D

59.789 --> 66.479
welcome brush yes Arjun when I actually

64.379 --> 67.86
took out the book which was few years

66.479 --> 71.369
before you actually did it

67.86 --> 72.99
yeah not much or notch it was at all

71.369 --> 74.58
like I mean you said like the three

72.99 --> 76.08
years ago there was not much yeah I

74.58 --> 78.509
would say like ten years ago there was

76.08 --> 80.759
nothing at all like you see it very much

78.509 --> 82.799
10-15 years ago it was nothing there and

80.759 --> 84.75
the thing was even in Paris parasha

82.799 --> 88.799
porous charts you know just the names

84.75 --> 91.17
are there and not much is there after

88.799 --> 93.81
that you know because those texts we

91.17 --> 95.22
have only fragments of it what the

93.81 --> 98.04
Rishi's actually said at that time and

95.22 --> 101.97
that thing that whole thing is not there

98.04 --> 103.77000000000001
right now just to go through so like so

101.97 --> 105.92999999999999
these are basically wider waist and of

103.77 --> 108.02
times then when you don't have that then

105.93 --> 110.28
you have to find things out yourself

108.02 --> 113.939
there's nothing else P the text is not

110.28 --> 117.32900000000001
there those keys are not there okay so

113.939 --> 119.219
you are you basically have to like start

117.329 --> 122.369
looking at the multiverse which you are

119.219 --> 124.79899999999999
in and start finding all things for

122.369 --> 126.659
yourself so that that's that's how I

124.799 --> 128.09
would start it like for me like like

126.659 --> 130.619
with the nutshell for example it is like

128.09 --> 132.72
like since moon transients one necessary

130.619 --> 133.74
every day right they became sort of an

132.72 --> 135.35999999999999
easier thing that everyday

133.74 --> 137.01000000000002
can look at the energy and then like

135.36 --> 139.95000000000002
dealing things about them get a picture

137.01 --> 143.42
one once I didn't do this for overseas

139.95 --> 147.54
of like 12 cycles like that's one year

143.42 --> 150.20999999999998
there was enough of a pony you know for

147.54 --> 152.48999999999998
each one there gentle basic sanity brush

150.21 --> 154.23000000000002
because when I started three years ago

152.49 --> 156.96
and I was telling there was not much

154.23 --> 159.20999999999998
material available so when you did this

156.96 --> 161.46
maybe 10-15 years ago when you started

159.21 --> 162.12
spinning and you know writing about nut

162.12 --> 166.5
how did you you know come about I mean

164.58 --> 168.48000000000002
did you did you have a lineage where you

166.5 --> 171.0
studied a paragraph in which you studied

168.48 --> 176.48999999999998
about mucha trails or you know did you

171.0 --> 177.84
have a burrow or what was it yeah yeah

176.49 --> 179.52
the thing is like a like I was not a

177.84 --> 181.05
book reader kind of book reading kind of

179.52 --> 182.70000000000002
person and what are the books were their

181.05 --> 184.05
intro this at the time they were very

182.7 --> 185.67
strange kind of books anyways like you

184.05 --> 187.5
know like all kinds of things okay like

185.67 --> 189.0
I mean this land is in this house this

187.5 --> 190.8
will happen or something strange is

189.0 --> 193.26
going to happen like what strange stuff

190.8 --> 195.12
is written I mean I mean you you can't

193.26 --> 197.82
make any sense or head or tails out of

195.12 --> 199.47
that anyways and penumbra's and stuff

197.82 --> 201.78
are not there any waves like no right

199.47 --> 203.91
you know I mean that is just doesn't

201.78 --> 205.17
exist anyway thank you know so that's

203.91 --> 206.7
what I said like you have to face the

205.17 --> 209.51999999999998
fact that it is why do I waste you have

206.7 --> 211.14
to find out if people are saying they're

209.52 --> 212.49
coming from this or that thing like even

211.14 --> 213.77999999999997
an Indian classical they say make coming

212.49 --> 215.85000000000002
from this film throw that thing but I

213.78 --> 218.61
mean when they play music they can make

215.85 --> 220.07999999999998
rainbows happen or they can't that thing

218.61 --> 222.12
it can't make plane happen or anything

220.08 --> 223.92000000000002
like they can't actually do anything no

222.12 --> 225.78
matter what part of it makes no

223.92 --> 228.26999999999998
difference right now you know their

225.78 --> 229.98
actual thing is forget you know you know

228.27 --> 232.29000000000002
even in in in class go over that thing I

229.98 --> 233.64
mean it just unlike a knowing like like

232.29 --> 234.98999999999998
it's like mosquitoes are buzzing or

233.64 --> 236.73
something like that you know it kind of

234.99 --> 239.67000000000002
sound there's nothing which is happening

236.73 --> 241.07999999999998
you know yeah I mean so I mean these

239.67 --> 242.60999999999999
things that become like a more of a like

241.08 --> 245.16000000000003
a joke now

242.61 --> 247.32000000000002
so rather than any kind of real serious

245.16 --> 249.12
thing like you think I mean really

247.32 --> 251.01
really can only be a individual

249.12 --> 253.32
initiative now when individual takes

251.01 --> 256.739
energy to say like okay I'm here I'm on

253.32 --> 258.65999999999997
this planet earth and I am surrounded by

256.739 --> 260.07
this whole thing and I don't know what

258.66 --> 262.32000000000005
it is and I'm going to try and find out

260.07 --> 264.57
so that basic earth has to be within an

262.32 --> 267.0
individual directly and from that urge

264.57 --> 267.4
they can do that and find those things

267.0 --> 268.54
out

267.4 --> 270.46
when Brahma first came into being here

268.54 --> 272.44
you know who he was then he has to take

270.46 --> 274.18
the individual initiative himself to

272.44 --> 276.37
find out all of that PS go to the purser

274.18 --> 278.08
for it we are at that situation where we

276.37 --> 279.789
are in that way and there is no nothing

278.08 --> 281.44
in the previous which you can bank on

279.789 --> 283.539
right now like that this is there oh

281.44 --> 286.449
that is there so I took it like that

283.539 --> 288.61
great I go by a meeting which was there

286.449 --> 290.86
it is like totally finding out for

288.61 --> 294.28000000000003
yourself this is very very fascinating

290.86 --> 296.139
because he said 12 cycles of the lunar

294.28 --> 297.69899999999996
cycles is what you observe and that is

296.139 --> 302.53000000000003
how you learned so this is very good

297.699 --> 304.41900000000004
eating is more about you know yeah yeah

302.53 --> 308.5
the only other element when needs is the

304.419 --> 310.99
opposite right ok so if you have the

308.5 --> 315.039
posture then your observation and stuff

310.99 --> 316.87
will be more be if you don't have the

315.039 --> 318.849
percept and you won't have it that be

316.87 --> 320.26
like okay I mean that makes a normal

318.849 --> 322.71999999999997
person starts observing them and things

320.26 --> 325.509
like that then they might not get like

322.72 --> 326.47
they might get confused right that you

325.509 --> 327.46000000000004
should you might happen like okay this

326.47 --> 329.05
is happening that is happening more

327.46 --> 330.69899999999996
going on like you know all those kind of

329.05 --> 331.90000000000003
things pull up you know so that's

330.699 --> 333.19
writing the process very important

331.9 --> 334.84
that's why I always stress on the basis

333.19 --> 336.49
like you have to have right food like

334.84 --> 339.01
you have to have like right posture

336.49 --> 341.169
right speech right lot of right things

339.01 --> 343.15
you have to do first before you can

341.169 --> 344.5
actually start studying anything more I

343.15 --> 345.909
only times I'll give you an example

344.5 --> 347.08
mushy codes when people may be used to

345.909 --> 348.28
go to fishing it's the first four five

347.08 --> 351.639
years the regimes will just make them

348.28 --> 355.29999999999995
sit down in a proper posture and just

351.639 --> 358.0
make them lose ours who's normal vowels

355.3 --> 360.46000000000004
properly for five years or five us they

358.0 --> 361.87
would do nothing but do these ten

360.46 --> 364.419
training center the mouth center their

361.87 --> 366.28000000000003
speech make sure there are M is right

364.419 --> 367.57
try make sure they understand it takes

366.28 --> 369.69899999999996
make sure they understand these basic

367.57 --> 371.5
things you know like take out the basic

369.699 --> 373.75
building blocks in place you know in

371.5 --> 374.97
first yeah which is like a basics and

373.75 --> 377.139
then from there you can do the Purcell

374.97 --> 380.05
once you have the basics in place and

377.139 --> 382.36
all of that which is what one should go

380.05 --> 384.97
for like Jim saying rather than jumping

382.36 --> 387.18
should be like do fission starter she

384.97 --> 390.43
knowledge is the tertiary you right

387.18 --> 391.87
there no primary like primary things are

390.43 --> 393.34000000000003
other things a secondary thing then they

391.87 --> 395.88
tertiary things but right now people

393.34 --> 398.409
want to jump from

395.88 --> 399.849
nobody want to do any basics like even

398.409 --> 401.02
if you I are very person on that thing

399.849 --> 402.729
that's the okay you know craft

401.02 --> 403.96
that basic diet or something something

402.729 --> 404.979
like that but people don't want that

403.96 --> 406.44899999999996
that's why they go to the allopathic

404.979 --> 408.06899999999996
because you can eat anything and then

406.449 --> 410.71000000000004
take the medicine you'll be fine you

408.069 --> 413.22900000000004
know like Jim say so so say that there's

410.71 --> 414.94
a general running away from basics and

413.229 --> 415.78
route things you know but even a plant

414.94 --> 419.379
grows from the root

415.78 --> 421.419
yeah goes from its top on like branches

419.379 --> 422.77000000000004
or anything like that so that the whole

421.419 --> 425.94899999999996
thing is like if you have to approach

422.77 --> 428.229
the whole thing in a holistic manner no

425.949 --> 429.66900000000004
it was like bhootish is one part of

428.229 --> 431.37899999999996
knowledge of which is so many knowledges

429.669 --> 434.02
are there which is like phenotypes

431.379 --> 435.97
mathematics so many science and so many

434.02 --> 438.69899999999996
things like music alchemy the numerology

435.97 --> 441.34000000000003
things which are connected to it if you

438.699 --> 443.16900000000004
don't have a broader perspective on it

441.34 --> 445.56899999999996
that you will get boxed in it was

443.169 --> 447.669
smaller small small zone and then what

445.569 --> 449.86
the perception of nakshatras or signs or

447.669 --> 451.84
anything will be limited that's what I

449.86 --> 454.24
mean now people will think of oh like

451.84 --> 456.31
which will make a police officer better

454.24 --> 459.069
and which nature will make anything I

456.31 --> 461.139
mean right just we add that kind of

459.069 --> 463.12
level I'm richer up example which is

461.139 --> 464.379
about going to forests and having

463.12 --> 466.3
journey through forests and beautiful

464.379 --> 468.37
places which it has about like beautiful

466.3 --> 471.969
places and beautiful nature kind of

468.37 --> 474.639
thing that this you know the way you and

471.969 --> 476.139
trying to explain you know I think more

474.639 --> 478.539
light on it I mean when you say British

476.139 --> 482.229
era you always think about the the head

478.539 --> 484.24
of the deer of the strike yeah there was

482.229 --> 486.52
more to it so what does that tell you I

484.24 --> 489.61
mean you can see that even the deer

486.52 --> 491.38
stays in forests only yeah your biggest

489.61 --> 493.449
is a nice place is like for us and it

491.38 --> 495.099
tastes there's a nice kind of way only

493.449 --> 497.44
like it's it is not that thing so a

495.099 --> 499.0
richer energy neck right now if people

497.44 --> 500.259
use it for traveling like okay

499.0 --> 503.38
so Richard a person will be traveling

500.259 --> 504.759
more yeah like but then beta determined

503.38 --> 507.279
to they might be traveling to theatres

504.759 --> 508.599
or if it just going to markets then no

507.279 --> 512.38
but which will not be the original

508.599 --> 514.539
meaning of that right which is good for

512.38 --> 515.77
us and nice places at Pune he says good

514.539 --> 517.5699999999999
for your energy which are good for your

515.77 --> 519.9399999999999
body which are good for your mind like

517.57 --> 522.849
so that the whole meaning know if the

519.94 --> 524.2600000000001
world gets changed and in that way the

522.849 --> 527.7700000000001
how the energy is utilized

524.26 --> 530.079
exchange to unite so do you do you mean

527.77 --> 532.72
to say that is suppose the moon is

530.079 --> 534.64
transiting brother Shara nakshatra and

532.72 --> 536.59
those things would be

534.64 --> 539.11
good days for you to go into a park you

536.59 --> 545.77
know be closer to mother earth you know

539.11 --> 547.72
enjoy the Sun screen yes yes yes for any

545.77 --> 550.78
kind of travel to any nature lecture is

547.72 --> 553.33
the best thing even tastic yeah yeah and

550.78 --> 554.9499999999999
Romania is also good for it but it moves

553.33 --> 557.35
slowly nobody moves at a bullock-cart

554.95 --> 559.7800000000001
pace right right

557.35 --> 562.1800000000001
incorrect what is the pace of rowing you

559.78 --> 563.5899999999999
know a nice pace is slowly like I know

562.18 --> 566.29
if you have ever traveled in a bullock

563.59 --> 569.2900000000001
cart or not but you know it is a very

566.29 --> 572.11
very slow I don't think yeah we always

569.29 --> 574.75
you know Bulacan yeah Richard is quite

572.11 --> 577.65
fast by comparison is hollow-cheeked

574.75 --> 580.48
those stories where they say you know

577.65 --> 583.63
ruining of shatrah was supposed to be or

580.48 --> 587.08
the favorite spouse or the concert of

583.63 --> 590.26
new nanny spin i always are many

587.08 --> 592.0500000000001
researchers and is there something that

590.26 --> 595.36
is got to do with

592.05 --> 597.1899999999999
transiting Rohini because of which it is

595.36 --> 599.08
you know the new nakshatra the

597.19 --> 602.0200000000001
constellation might have a greater

599.08 --> 604.5400000000001
gravitational pull and maybe moon kind

602.02 --> 607.0
of slows down and it look to our

604.54 --> 609.3399999999999
ancestors as though moon was spending

607.0 --> 611.04
more time and Ragini is there some

609.34 --> 614.2800000000001
connection like that or is it something

611.04 --> 616.63
it's something else

614.28 --> 622.3
first let's go to earth metal mythology

616.63 --> 624.07
mythology to me is like my truth th is

622.3 --> 628.3299999999999
there but you just expanded th you get

624.07 --> 631.21
truth my apology like mythologies only

628.33 --> 632.1700000000001
truth we have connected all the things

631.21 --> 634.45
which we are taught in school and

632.17 --> 635.65
science they all were false anyway like

634.45 --> 636.85
whatever we are taught in school or

635.65 --> 639.22
whatever we have being towed out there

636.85 --> 641.26
is wrong and falls anyways it only is

639.22 --> 642.97
the only truth there is enrichment

641.26 --> 645.04
diversity which actually explained this

642.97 --> 648.19
multiverse and which tells reality is

645.04 --> 650.13
about it right so it's not now it's

648.19 --> 653.0200000000001
called a myth myth means something poles

650.13 --> 654.76
or not real or something that when it is

653.02 --> 657.13
the actual real thing the only real

654.76 --> 659.26
thing okay after clearing that up like

657.13 --> 660.58
throw anything like I mean just if you

659.26 --> 662.68
just brought it up so I'll tell you like

660.58 --> 664.12
the thing with doing is why does the

662.68 --> 665.9499999999999
favorite of the moon and why's it so

664.12 --> 668.529
that thing alluring is because it has

665.95 --> 671.5590000000001
moon - it is the month right

668.529 --> 673.509
okay now Moonbeam in the business award

671.559 --> 676.269
movies a feminine planet correct

673.509 --> 680.319
women Venus is a feminine planet yeah so

676.269 --> 682.569
you double terminal right so that is the

680.319 --> 685.4789999999999
most attractive automatically whether

682.569 --> 687.189
double feminine has been combined then

685.479 --> 690.359
that that would make center practice

687.189 --> 694.569
where that is there like um it will

690.359 --> 697.0590000000001
enhance beauty and a feminine way thank

694.569 --> 699.789
the most like you say pusher like but

697.059 --> 702.429
push ice at moon and sack you have a key

699.789 --> 703.809
it can't have that a load of Venus so

702.429 --> 705.909
she has got similar kind of energies but

703.809 --> 708.3689999999999
still it can't be more venus like here

705.909 --> 710.319
thing so again like enricher has more

708.369 --> 713.109
maths right so that's different

710.319 --> 717.0989999999999
oceanic chakra is auspicious for doing

713.109 --> 719.589
all activities except marriages so why

717.099 --> 721.989
is that marriage is what is your opinion

719.589 --> 725.139
what is your interpretation the word

721.989 --> 726.4290000000001
marriage like you like a marriage like

725.139 --> 727.809
we have to understand what context are

726.429 --> 730.569
we talking about marriage I'll be

727.809 --> 732.459
talking in a modern context are we

730.569 --> 734.769
talking them in the Indian context are

732.459 --> 736.899
we talking in a Western context are we

734.769 --> 738.399
talking in the way the context you know

736.899 --> 740.619
the word marriage comes to Mars actually

738.399 --> 744.459
there may be the concept of MA mom are

740.619 --> 745.929
we at Maria McMurray not many which is

744.459 --> 749.829
which is very which is this which is

745.929 --> 750.909
actually the sea right okay so that's

749.829 --> 752.409
why the laws out there are called

750.909 --> 753.759
maritime laws and things like that but

752.409 --> 755.799
but that is the two different topic but

753.759 --> 758.319
remember it comes from that roof now

755.799 --> 759.8489999999999
Mars is a planet you know which is that

758.319 --> 761.169
thing yeah I'm now people won't

759.849 --> 763.5390000000001
understand the Masters house mass relay

761.169 --> 765.189
devotions that thing the word which is

763.539 --> 768.189
that thing which are can connect it to

765.189 --> 769.659
that you know it's them like to do with

768.189 --> 771.9699999999999
alchemy like in the sense like if you

769.659 --> 774.22
have two Nadi's inside of you it and

771.97 --> 777.429
they married together in Pula

774.22 --> 780.399
in the third eye in them you are buying

777.429 --> 783.279
it right okay so that package okay of

780.399 --> 786.969
the left and right side of you you right

783.279 --> 788.769
okay so I mean like men so when this

786.969 --> 790.149
word marriage is used like um saying if

788.769 --> 791.979
people don't know what it open more like

790.149 --> 793.779
that modern console manage which is then

791.979 --> 795.999
game concept which is like a range

793.779 --> 797.799
marriage and you know which was not

795.999 --> 799.899
didn't scriptures anyways baby

797.799 --> 802.63
scriptures don't carry anything like

799.899 --> 804.16
dramatic any

802.63 --> 806.82
while they swim but there is all these

804.16 --> 809.92
things but there is no arranged marriage

806.82 --> 812.98
how can be associated or associated with

809.92 --> 815.02
any of them you say no not associated

812.98 --> 816.97
with the modern form of marriage whether

815.02 --> 818.68
it's a show me whether it's remember any

816.97 --> 821.5
on whether it's anything like I mean no

818.68 --> 822.7299999999999
demo like I mean you can't like so

821.5 --> 824.65
whether they're good or bad for it is

822.73 --> 827.5
just nonsense because none of them

824.65 --> 829.75
uneven associated with it nonsense you

827.5 --> 831.25
can do it in any nakshatra it will it'll

829.75 --> 834.94
be nonsense in there are multiversal

831.25 --> 837.49
terms anyway so I did get bad results

834.94 --> 838.84
wrong right you will get that is even if

837.49 --> 840.58
your marriage lasts you'll get bad

838.84 --> 841.99
results if it doesn't lad you did get

840.58 --> 845.1700000000001
bad results I mean you'll never get good

841.99 --> 846.85
results out of doing normally that is

845.17 --> 848.11
never gonna happen no matter what nature

846.85 --> 848.5
throw you do it it it makes no

848.11 --> 850.36
difference

848.5 --> 851.8
we have boxed these long ships raised

850.36 --> 853.96
with certain activities which was not

851.8 --> 856.6899999999999
actually true isn't it it's not just box

853.96 --> 858.61
neck it's like a trying to take a system

856.69 --> 860.5
which is the multi question it's an

858.61 --> 863.76
actual chuck tree law system and trying

860.5 --> 868.84
to somehow put it into your own box

863.76 --> 871.5699999999999
right which is totally opposite of what

868.84 --> 873.5500000000001
the whole multiverse Lloyd's right

871.57 --> 877.5600000000001
do you somehow trying to squeeze that

873.55 --> 880.3299999999999
into it you know which is like a

877.56 --> 883.51
tankless exercise and it will you know

880.33 --> 885.13
result in the end you know it is not

883.51 --> 887.26
gonna yield any results this kind of

885.13 --> 889.18
thing you know so I mean that's why I

887.26 --> 890.25
say like the whole Indian ways money do

889.18 --> 892.9599999999999
you opposite or the way the

890.25 --> 896.59
quick-connect typically okay right now

892.96 --> 899.38
like if like holy for example yeah or

896.59 --> 901.57
the festival where which is now they're

899.38 --> 903.04
in India everybody knows it you know and

901.57 --> 903.4000000000001
people are just doing colors have each

903.04 --> 907.6899999999999
other

903.4 --> 911.05
and story story is that dialogue went

907.69 --> 912.7
against another ship we do what is

911.05 --> 913.81
father was selling him in a fish of

912.7 --> 915.61
tried to kill em and me buddy couldn't

913.81 --> 918.8199999999999
kill em or anything you can do any harm

915.61 --> 920.62
to it refers to defect yeah the moral of

918.82 --> 924.4300000000001
the story is once you not listen to

920.62 --> 927.73
one's parents right that is the moral of

924.43 --> 928.9599999999999
the story right but in India on Holi day

927.73 --> 931.88
would you say that people are holding

928.96 --> 934.49
banners once you not is no unfair right

931.88 --> 936.709
I mean I'm not seeing it Thank You Izzy

934.49 --> 938.48
I mean I mean I've never seen that kind

936.709 --> 940.16
of thing happening you know so many

938.48 --> 941.3000000000001
people up I mean I don't know what is

940.16 --> 945.41
that to do with throwing colors at each

941.3 --> 946.25
other or it sweeps or will order like

945.41 --> 948.709
hugging each other

946.25 --> 950.149
I mean like what is that got to do with

948.709 --> 952.069
the fact that one should is no divine

950.149 --> 953.87
note once we're ready

952.069 --> 956.029
but tanks because Indian bear is one a

953.87 --> 958.16
solution to one's parents yeah because

956.029 --> 960.16
that is the Indian nothing which is got

958.16 --> 965.209
nothing to with the way the quay yeah

960.16 --> 967.37
again money did you opposite yeah yes if

965.209 --> 970.13
you parent going to hell and their

967.37 --> 971.089
brains have gone crazy and they are like

970.13 --> 973.31
nothing why would you listen to that

971.089 --> 974.87
unless you want to go to hell too I mean

973.31 --> 977.5999999999999
is they know divine in this multiverse

974.87 --> 979.339
it is a nothing make you think all Vedic

977.6 --> 981.1700000000001
things say that like in that current

979.339 --> 983.269
thing like this I mean even when Gita

981.17 --> 984.9799999999999
Krishna was telling Norton that even

983.269 --> 986.69
none of these people are anything if

984.98 --> 988.22
they take the side of the wrong then

986.69 --> 989.7790000000001
there that's it like it doesn't matter

988.22 --> 990.769
which a guru say or relative you see or

989.779 --> 993.05
that thing if none of these things

990.769 --> 995.089
matter but even where Gita has been

993.05 --> 997.67
twisted up around 180 degree like

995.089 --> 999.3800000000001
everything oh they're same thing they're

997.67 --> 1002.259
trying to do with naturalist and what

999.38 --> 1004.81
was the way the way of understanding the

1002.259 --> 1006.3100000000001
nakshatras so if we can get okay

1004.81 --> 1009.0999999999999
like for example if we take a Schwinn II

1006.31 --> 1010.959
yeah okay he's right

1009.1 --> 1012.0400000000001
somebody says okay you ever shown in

1010.959 --> 1013.93
your chart you should become a doctor

1012.04 --> 1015.61
now I'm a doctor means like he'll be

1013.93 --> 1016.779
giving poisons and repete medicines the

1015.61 --> 1017.92
poisons they'll be giving poison to

1016.779 --> 1019.63
other people now how will that be

1017.92 --> 1021.25
healing then then I'll be making the

1019.63 --> 1022.6
more sick so the same energy will

1021.25 --> 1024.49
becomes perverted and convoluted

1022.6 --> 1028.449
something which was for some positive

1024.49 --> 1030.069
that thing will become negative in the

1028.449 --> 1032.23
current day use and stuff like that

1030.069 --> 1035.5
Sweeney was associated with healers do

1032.23 --> 1037.75
you think it's because of k2 being the

1035.5 --> 1042.97
color of the eighth house of Scorpio

1037.75 --> 1044.409
from Aries actually kumaras first now

1042.97 --> 1045.64
Hashanah kumaras are born straight from

1044.409 --> 1048.5490000000002
the Sun and they are horses

1045.64 --> 1051.159
yeah they move right now if you know the

1048.549 --> 1054.19
sun's light on earth does all the

1051.159 --> 1056.5300000000002
photosynthesis you know it and all the

1054.19 --> 1058.27
plants come out of Suns like that's

1056.53 --> 1061.1499999999999
where this sun rays come and then the

1058.27 --> 1065.2
whole grains can I go hogs are right

1061.15 --> 1066.97
those turns are hubs so Sun Sansa

1065.2 --> 1068.529
there who knows about this process and

1066.97 --> 1071.2
they know what herb is what then they

1068.529 --> 1072.909
even know which plant gives walk and

1071.2 --> 1074.8300000000002
then they have motion and they can move

1072.909 --> 1076.6000000000001
and help people because they are most

1074.83 --> 1077.62
right into their toothache

1076.6 --> 1080.08
they have knowledge of the herbs and

1077.62 --> 1081.61
their motion it's fast it's faster

1080.08 --> 1084.309
fastened together like a hosta as far as

1081.61 --> 1086.529
push as fast as Shoney's fast no those

1084.309 --> 1088.6589999999999
those are fast so you have to understand

1086.529 --> 1091.419
why this is coming from it's it's a from

1088.659 --> 1093.3400000000001
a solar point and that's where Sun comes

1091.419 --> 1097.0
into play for the first thing is the

1093.34 --> 1098.9189999999999
sunrise right first rays of the new Sun

1097.0 --> 1101.86
it is a short leg

1098.919 --> 1106.21
that's when or the Pisces portion Sun

1101.86 --> 1107.4089999999999
comes out begins and that's where it's

1106.21 --> 1109.769
maximum maximum exaltation and

1107.409 --> 1112.3300000000002
everything is because of that industry

1109.769 --> 1114.309
there are some sons and all of that like

1112.33 --> 1115.72
you know so it is because of that you

1114.309 --> 1117.4289999999999
combine so many things in a click you

1115.72 --> 1118.09
will find out why it fits and why it is

1117.429 --> 1120.6390000000001
he

1118.09 --> 1122.26
and like I mean for shivering the whole

1120.639 --> 1124.269
night and stuff it's cold and that thing

1122.26 --> 1126.279
in the first sunrays come it's like more

1124.269 --> 1128.95
making some some warmth and stuff comes

1126.279 --> 1130.84
can you tell me you know what is your

1128.95 --> 1134.039
interpretation why do you think OSHA is

1130.84 --> 1137.11
a is a sheep nutshell is there any

1134.039 --> 1141.399
interpretation or do you have any ways

1137.11 --> 1142.99
to think why I mean if you see Mac lab

1141.399 --> 1146.59
if you see in a crammed on the right

1142.99 --> 1149.38
network or fastest crab mode it's very

1146.59 --> 1151.779
soothing crap crap moves very fast it

1149.38 --> 1156.73
has iMovie I like to look at even the

1151.779 --> 1158.5
crab moves very fast right and zigzags

1156.73 --> 1162.85
and it's sideways and backwards like

1158.5 --> 1168.25
that right pushes like it is the crab

1162.85 --> 1171.6999999999998
part of that sign like it is that grab

1168.25 --> 1174.1
part of it it is the fast moving part of

1171.7 --> 1176.289
it it is like and it's a zigzag motion

1174.1 --> 1179.83
it's like the motion of the mind right

1176.289 --> 1182.98
how out was mind this solo that's how

1179.83 --> 1183.549
fast push it I mean change it is a

1182.98 --> 1186.76
vegetable

1183.549 --> 1191.139
I mean it's doesn't need to be facets ok

1186.76 --> 1192.94
bitly has been a tree when you stand in

1191.139 --> 1195.1589999999999
one place and they say yeah like that

1192.94 --> 1197.21
you're one there is no need to move in

1195.159 --> 1199.64
at all in a post game

1197.21 --> 1201.32
the battle is over will please done you

1199.64 --> 1203.39
you have gotten the victory in matter

1201.32 --> 1204.47
ends like you know at that time people I

1203.39 --> 1205.49
mean many people are saying that things

1204.47 --> 1207.17
they don't understand more it is the

1205.49 --> 1209.53
mouth like you know they're not using

1207.17 --> 1212.93
any common sense about dominance right

1209.53 --> 1213.92
the first things so I mean but again all

1212.93 --> 1216.1100000000001
of those things are because of the lack

1213.92 --> 1217.94
of basics I said like drink to make back

1216.11 --> 1218.75
of the lack of common sense and stuff

1217.94 --> 1221.5700000000002
like that

1218.75 --> 1223.34
I mean whatever things are not Vedic are

1221.57 --> 1224.27
not as per Vedic things and stuff which

1223.34 --> 1227.24
are they right now

1224.27 --> 1230.6
meaning place bill convoluted apply

1227.24 --> 1233.75
signatures to study nurtured has the

1230.6 --> 1236.09
same nonsense moves into them too right

1233.75 --> 1238.49
it doesn't stay out of that paradigm you

1236.09 --> 1239.87
know and as like as far as not knowing

1238.49 --> 1242.27
is consent for example go through for me

1239.87 --> 1244.1899999999998
the axis yeah

1242.27 --> 1246.8
it raised to the pole started

1244.19 --> 1249.3500000000001
relationship access but if you do not

1246.8 --> 1253.6399999999999
understand what access is then you can't

1249.35 --> 1255.1999999999998
know anything but actually war is an

1253.64 --> 1255.89
access you don't know whether earth has

1255.2 --> 1258.68
an axis

1255.89 --> 1260.47
you know like or is the central pole of

1258.68 --> 1263.48
the earth and what is that related to

1260.47 --> 1265.34
why water what is the central axis on

1263.48 --> 1269.06
which the whole around which the whole

1265.34 --> 1272.84
Brahman or different realms say that

1269.06 --> 1274.61
knowledge you understand and how it is

1272.84 --> 1279.23
related to its different pole which is

1274.61 --> 1282.9799999999998
suitable right the axis mucho Mucho for

1279.23 --> 1284.96
me to throw bottom both are axis

1282.98 --> 1286.64
Mentalist right and there will be

1284.96 --> 1288.95
degrees opposite to each other that's

1286.64 --> 1292.67
why so the line connects two points in

1288.95 --> 1295.8500000000001
it then you get access it is free it is

1292.67 --> 1301.3400000000001
filter funny because when is about I

1295.85 --> 1306.62
have seen if you look even at the animal

1301.34 --> 1309.47
symbol okay one is the male cow not bull

1306.62 --> 1315.26
which is and then right opposite is the

1309.47 --> 1317.42
female the other access data access not

1315.26 --> 1320.12
to cross the other to access multiplet

1317.42 --> 1323.0600000000002
okay like in my chart like my Moon and

1320.12 --> 1326.59
Mars are in one motion is in Myanmar's

1323.06 --> 1329.6799999999998
is not about their exact same degree

1326.59 --> 1332.74
the 77 degrees for so they are forming

1329.68 --> 1335.1100000000001
an exact like axis and Oh throwback with

1332.74 --> 1337.24
is the ocean the ocean of the world it's

1335.11 --> 1339.1599999999999
like the world ocean from which the

1337.24 --> 1344.47
whole route comes and then you have the

1339.16 --> 1346.51
top the Mount Meru Wow the whole ocean

1344.47 --> 1348.66
to the Mount Meru and that's access

1346.51 --> 1349.93
around which everything churns

1348.66 --> 1351.73
interesting

1349.93 --> 1354.25
who is this joining an axis in which

1351.73 --> 1356.5
that's why they show like like like a

1354.25 --> 1358.54
like a rotors and drummer sitting on at

1356.5 --> 1360.76
there or Vishnu holding the thing from

1358.54 --> 1362.47
the bottom the whole axis around the

1360.76 --> 1366.1
churning of the ocean happens everything

1362.47 --> 1368.08
so you know that whole mythology of that

1366.1 --> 1371.08
comes into play with those Hunan sisters

1368.08 --> 1374.74
again though so people won't understand

1371.08 --> 1377.29
what these things are until you open

1374.74 --> 1379.21
your mind up to the other things you

1377.29 --> 1380.53
know like your knowledge of natural as

1379.21 --> 1383.23
as machine you know about other things

1380.53 --> 1385.6299999999999
actually you know but it is a very

1383.23 --> 1387.01
fascinating you told me about Moreau I

1385.63 --> 1389.2900000000002
didn't know about known made oh but what

1387.01 --> 1394.68
I would connect with with these to him

1389.29 --> 1397.36
it's both goony and both are you know

1394.68 --> 1398.8600000000001
they're facing upwards they are they are

1397.36 --> 1400.54
the ones on which the data access or one

1398.86 --> 1403.6
which the whole thing spins you know as

1400.54 --> 1406.95
someone one thing happens Wow comes out

1403.6 --> 1411.01
you know so that is the axis actually

1406.95 --> 1413.41
okay but but it is why people kind of

1411.01 --> 1416.68
correlate we think about the Buddha with

1413.41 --> 1419.95
Lakshmi as well is that correct refer me

1416.68 --> 1421.3
to a palimony and about the Nexus yeah

1419.95 --> 1423.49
oh yeah because that's where the

1421.3 --> 1425.86
churning is happening from wow yeah this

1423.49 --> 1430.36
axis from which it churns the whole

1425.86 --> 1434.1699999999998
thing kind of becomes social now in your

1430.36 --> 1435.1599999999999
body and if you assume now is becoming

1434.17 --> 1436.63
bigger only and that's when the

1435.16 --> 1438.3100000000002
kundalini rises that's when you open

1436.63 --> 1440.95
that alive everything happens on access

1438.31 --> 1442.9299999999998
assume the body is social neither

1440.95 --> 1446.92
central axis in the whole multiverse

1442.93 --> 1448.15
this Mount Meru access is there so so

1446.92 --> 1449.74
the access is the most important concept

1448.15 --> 1452.1100000000001
with of those two not triplets guru bath

1449.74 --> 1454.06
but also like if if people don't know

1452.11 --> 1456.6699999999998
about all kinds of different things

1454.06 --> 1458.35
which are happening in this world what

1456.67 --> 1460.029
they call black magic or different

1458.35 --> 1461.9789999999998
Annika act on the lawn of

1460.029 --> 1463.389
things which manipulation of Chuck taine

1461.979 --> 1464.349
many man manners if you don't know

1463.389 --> 1465.7289999999998
anything about it then you will know

1464.349 --> 1467.4089999999999
anymore two robots you'll have very

1465.729 --> 1469.179
limited knowledge about it like like a

1467.409 --> 1471.8790000000001
normal person per moment will be like

1469.179 --> 1473.499
all a lot stress strain uncomfortable

1471.879 --> 1475.9889999999998
situations and things like that because

1473.499 --> 1477.7
poor Methodism energy which is a strong

1475.989 --> 1479.259
intense energy right and normal people

1477.7 --> 1480.94
don't want to cope with so in normal

1479.259 --> 1482.379
people charting Elizabeth but is there

1480.94 --> 1483.8200000000002
it is always like trouble for that that

1482.379 --> 1485.4089999999999
planet is causing me problems like do

1483.82 --> 1488.59
you think that's all you know because

1485.409 --> 1491.6490000000001
whoever demands like discipline like

1488.59 --> 1493.9889999999998
whenever you do any said do anything you

1491.649 --> 1496.029
have to have discipline okay that's the

1493.989 --> 1498.07
first thing anything demands and put all

1496.029 --> 1499.479
work but demands that okay so if you

1498.07 --> 1500.9189999999999
don't have discipline you will fail or

1499.479 --> 1502.3890000000001
bad things will happen to you and all

1500.919 --> 1504.94
kinds of things will happen immediately

1502.389 --> 1506.559
it's a very cut that thing so but when I

1504.94 --> 1508.719
put it in a nutshell people think and

1506.559 --> 1509.4289999999999
then I'm actually minimizing it they

1508.719 --> 1512.259
have no children

1509.429 --> 1514.5700000000002
you know like or putting it into darker

1512.259 --> 1516.909
life but that's a fact or the much other

1514.57 --> 1519.9689999999998
than it is an intense energy and it has

1516.909 --> 1522.3090000000002
to be if you have it you will have to

1519.969 --> 1524.2
have the discipline to go with it

1522.309 --> 1525.609
you cannot it's nothing which you mess

1524.2 --> 1527.409
about it with other some other than

1525.609 --> 1530.1999999999998
accessorize you can get away with things

1527.409 --> 1531.0990000000002
mildly which fit into the box and even

1530.2 --> 1532.57
in this world there's so many things

1531.099 --> 1534.609
which happen there's so many wars and so

1532.57 --> 1536.049
many strains think so many which was so

1534.609 --> 1537.399
many sacrifices I mean then all kinds of

1536.049 --> 1539.139
things happening which come under Peru

1537.399 --> 1542.109
but but which people don't even come to

1539.139 --> 1543.4599999999998
know like why are these was happening

1542.109 --> 1545.499
what is the reason for this all of that

1543.46 --> 1547.929
like people just don't know so get a lot

1545.499 --> 1549.219
of hidden things behind things and if

1547.929 --> 1551.409
you don't have that consciousness which

1549.219 --> 1552.789
is knowing those things you can't

1551.409 --> 1554.409
interpret them into the like foo robots

1552.789 --> 1556.749
but for example this thing on the -

1554.409 --> 1558.729
Alicia yeah I think that we brought

1556.749 --> 1562.479
about over budget because this has been

1558.729 --> 1564.3690000000001
a very mysterious solution I found this

1562.479 --> 1567.1290000000001
poor one drop further noxious rain the

1564.369 --> 1569.1689999999999
toughest to actually understand and you

1567.129 --> 1570.549
know kind of apron are doing the thing

1569.169 --> 1573.759
with poo butter there's so many things

1570.549 --> 1578.229
it's like ship ganas the ship can as a

1573.759 --> 1580.509
rule back alright okay ship ganas all

1578.229 --> 1582.1290000000001
scary things for normal people thank

1580.509 --> 1586.089
goodness are the most scary things like

1582.129 --> 1588.789
oh the girls the mood he was far as yeah

1586.089 --> 1593.6799999999998
all those things are coming up over now

1588.789 --> 1595.24
alright when she produced at the time

1593.68 --> 1597.7
he had nothing with Dutch wind-ups

1595.24 --> 1599.29
didn't bow oh and that whole thing

1597.7 --> 1601.78
happened so when she produced that

1599.29 --> 1603.82
energy and send it to the up then that

1601.78 --> 1605.44
shows head was cut off by that energy at

1603.82 --> 1608.02
that time which to achieve created that

1605.44 --> 1609.3300000000002
all happens under poor robot wow I

1608.02 --> 1612.28
didn't know that

1609.33 --> 1614.47
okay I mean okay that's the whole thing

1612.28 --> 1616.36
guru Beckford is so it comes to with

1614.47 --> 1618.94
certain kind of things which people

1616.36 --> 1620.59
would rather run away from because

1618.94 --> 1624.31
people right now are behaving like that

1620.59 --> 1625.99
show themself right okay like headless

1624.31 --> 1628.12
chicken people are moving in circles

1625.99 --> 1629.08
like endless yeah and they're

1628.12 --> 1630.6399999999999
behaving like that stem cells that

1629.08 --> 1633.04
they're not acknowledging divine what

1630.64 --> 1634.6000000000001
did that school did it did not

1633.04 --> 1636.97
acknowledge him and his divinity

1634.6 --> 1638.7099999999998
correct okay and beings right now they

1636.97 --> 1640.09
don't actually acknowledge the manatee

1638.71 --> 1641.47
right now so they are the same position

1640.09 --> 1643.27
as Dutch and what will happen to them

1641.47 --> 1645.13
then will be same thing what happens

1643.27 --> 1647.53
without soap or buttons will bring that

1645.13 --> 1650.71
all that destruction onto them and all

1647.53 --> 1653.74
of that which nobody wants to quit the

1650.71 --> 1655.69
simple matter for the something face man

1653.74 --> 1658.72
you see that these people have kind of a

1655.69 --> 1660.5800000000002
dual nature or something face to face

1658.72 --> 1662.65
yeah the dual nature will happen in the

1660.58 --> 1665.53
sense that I mean it's like a cooperates

1662.65 --> 1668.26
right now this painting suit-and-tie

1665.53 --> 1669.73
okay and then they will sell you poisons

1668.26 --> 1671.3799999999999
and they'll sell you arms they will sell

1669.73 --> 1673.66
you this thing is that kind of thing you

1671.38 --> 1676.42
you understand them say yeah it feels

1673.66 --> 1677.8600000000001
like worldly and reasonable right but

1676.42 --> 1680.14
what is happening in the background is

1677.86 --> 1681.85
not and like with the affleck activity

1680.14 --> 1683.3500000000001
your CIA FBI or any of these things I

1681.85 --> 1684.58
mean they just people like that suits

1683.35 --> 1686.29
and stuff all the time but there's a lot

1684.58 --> 1687.73
of stuff which is going on which nobody

1686.29 --> 1689.74
wants to know about any you know sir

1687.73 --> 1692.2
there is a whole that thing to pull the

1689.74 --> 1693.67
button like that I mean it's the kind of

1692.2 --> 1695.3500000000001
thing which most normal people that

1693.67 --> 1698.41
anyways don't want to go into even like

1695.35 --> 1701.26
in India yeah like if somebody in a some

1698.41 --> 1702.8200000000002
Shawn or something with that but that is

1701.26 --> 1704.71
poor over there comes in a forward but

1702.82 --> 1707.08
you know I mean there's nothing do with

1704.71 --> 1711.18
normal people anyways again people

1707.08 --> 1714.76
utilize the energy in a better way for a

1711.18 --> 1717.97
simple about hiring divine know what but

1714.76 --> 1719.23
do not give anything and what is that

1717.97 --> 1721.39
should have to do what about bishop

1719.23 --> 1723.25
matter and is like Jim saying just do

1721.39 --> 1725.91
that and Boulevard won't give you

1723.25 --> 1727.03
trouble if you clip your head up and

1725.91 --> 1730.5700000000002
then

1727.03 --> 1731.86
pura vodka is there right yeah so it's a

1730.57 --> 1732.52
very simple thing the things are very

1731.86 --> 1734.83
simple actually

1732.52 --> 1736.09
but again people who do that so like to

1734.83 --> 1737.56
understand shape and it's live in Italy

1736.09 --> 1739.6299999999999
and that thing and all of that requires

1737.56 --> 1741.25
some kind of sense as well which people

1739.63 --> 1742.42
don't have right now they think shape is

1741.25 --> 1743.5
something like they're going to some

1742.42 --> 1745.15
tempers they don't even know anything

1743.5 --> 1745.99
bunch of like Indians go to chip tempers

1745.15 --> 1746.95
all the time but they don't know

1745.99 --> 1748.69
anything about they don't

1746.95 --> 1750.19
understand what third eye open thing is

1748.69 --> 1752.92
like or whatever they have no idea of

1750.19 --> 1754.69
these like they will not even come to

1752.92 --> 1756.3100000000002
know like so their worship is fake

1754.69 --> 1757.8400000000001
worship when you do false worship and

1756.31 --> 1760.24
that thing then pour water hits at you

1757.84 --> 1762.1599999999999
you know it okay

1760.24 --> 1764.56
so poor but present day news energy that

1762.16 --> 1766.8400000000001
way you know like and that's why it's

1764.56 --> 1768.6699999999998
such a danger sign from normal people I

1766.84 --> 1770.6499999999999
think the same thing is with Ashley and

1768.67 --> 1774.0600000000002
things like like we Shaka for example

1770.65 --> 1774.0600000000002
over chelation we take the chakra force

1775.05 --> 1782.29
in one word is obsession be sharp eyes

1778.81 --> 1783.6599999999999
on she she okay if you happen one word

1782.29 --> 1785.98
frogfish Akkad is only one word

1783.66 --> 1786.97
obsession no but now then you have to

1785.98 --> 1789.52
choose what time what are you going to

1786.97 --> 1792.24
be obsess about right obsess about

1789.52 --> 1794.77
higher and divine things then it's good

1792.24 --> 1796.39
nonsense then it's bad but there is no

1794.77 --> 1798.94
other way for that but it's an extreme

1796.39 --> 1801.0600000000002
energy because it is obsessed know when

1798.94 --> 1802.99
they get obsessive grace obsessed

1801.06 --> 1804.22
strange a lot of people they get

1802.99 --> 1806.95
obsessed about everything and they can't

1804.22 --> 1809.5
leave it like right what's it eat into

1806.95 --> 1810.5800000000002
it it doesn't know how to let go you

1809.5 --> 1811.66
know people can be Shaka will be

1810.58 --> 1813.85
committing suicides and stuff and stuff

1811.66 --> 1815.3200000000002
like that cause okay they tried to go

1813.85 --> 1816.85
into this exam or something and then

1815.32 --> 1818.5
they didn't qualify or clear and then

1816.85 --> 1819.58
think they to try again oh if two to

1818.5 --> 1821.83
three times you don't go then they will

1819.58 --> 1823.06
commit suicide like right so that's the

1821.83 --> 1827.02
negative aspect of it but I don't know

1823.06 --> 1832.3899999999999
how to sugarcoat that it's it's what it

1827.02 --> 1833.65
is do you see a lot of in groggy right

1832.39 --> 1836.6100000000001
the Gaiety

1833.65 --> 1839.89
archetype is in doggy it's why I've seen

1836.61 --> 1841.6599999999999
natives having this it's a mission

1839.89 --> 1844.3000000000002
except that mix you know sharp as well

1841.66 --> 1847.39
as so so do you see the mixed qualities

1844.3 --> 1850.12
and obsessions even with I mean it's not

1847.39 --> 1852.5700000000002
like but obviously it's not it's soft

1850.12 --> 1855.82
compared to pull over okay yeah fanon

1852.57 --> 1857.809
comparison to put my yeah this next

1855.82 --> 1860.119
level energy of the shock

1857.809 --> 1862.609
and where do you place Ashley Sharon

1860.119 --> 1864.379
amongst these three I mean Ashley she

1862.609 --> 1866.09
also Ashley as is pulling energy and

1864.379 --> 1867.9189999999999
serpentine energy and things like that

1866.09 --> 1869.119
right I mean Ashley thank you energy and

1867.919 --> 1872.3890000000001
all of those things can be used properly

1869.119 --> 1873.529
or can be I mean again both things can

1872.389 --> 1875.809
happen with isolation

1873.529 --> 1877.519
mm-hmm ash nature life is like in be

1875.809 --> 1880.46
like devious like a snake

1877.519 --> 1882.739
you know like connected yes like a snake

1880.46 --> 1884.749
you know like that thing so it is either

1882.739 --> 1887.359
the serpent will move upwards as a

1884.749 --> 1888.979
colony or there's new biggest things so

1887.359 --> 1891.08
both things are aspects of their like I

1888.979 --> 1893.8990000000001
mean there's no way to since in modern

1891.08 --> 1895.6689999999999
times not many people use and etcetera

1893.899 --> 1897.7389999999998
is positively tonight through the

1895.669 --> 1899.3590000000002
negative aspects are more come out

1897.739 --> 1901.07
anyways because people don't know how to

1899.359 --> 1903.019
use the energies or the natural system

1901.07 --> 1905.029
properly anyway so some people thought

1903.019 --> 1907.82
that I had painted some rich mm more

1905.029 --> 1909.859
dark light in my book but they are just

1907.82 --> 1912.979
like that they are harder for normal

1909.859 --> 1915.4089999999999
people which I called muggles to deal

1912.979 --> 1918.559
with you know so in the imagination of a

1915.409 --> 1922.0990000000002
shark approval it's a tougher chart for

1918.559 --> 1923.45
people then other energies as compared

1922.099 --> 1925.359
to other image I mean that's what that's

1923.45 --> 1929.059
what that's why I said that in that way

1925.359 --> 1930.2289999999998
like that was my reasoning for that it's

1929.059 --> 1931.82
not like that they don't have positive

1930.229 --> 1933.589
aspects I mean the chakra is the

1931.82 --> 1936.489
obsession you can obsess about that

1933.589 --> 1939.379
thing and go talk about competition yeah

1936.489 --> 1941.769
use a form of station only you have more

1939.379 --> 1944.809
tells is it but form of obsession only

1941.769 --> 1945.409
how can you use the artificial energy in

1944.809 --> 1947.089
a better way

1945.409 --> 1950.3300000000002
now you've said it's addiction etcetera

1947.089 --> 1953.45
it's a sharp dreadful shudder but how

1950.33 --> 1957.4689999999998
can the people somebody is coming to the

1953.45 --> 1959.269
center you Center as a being then the

1957.469 --> 1960.279
sushumna will become whiter than the

1959.269 --> 1963.229
only moonrise

1960.279 --> 1967.039
right so that's how you use oscillation

1963.229 --> 1968.3590000000002
energy you have to Center my like you

1967.039 --> 1969.559
are nice tidy you can't be talking from

1968.359 --> 1970.609
one side of your mouth you have to be

1969.559 --> 1972.379
talking from the center of your mouth

1970.609 --> 1974.089
the more discipline you ruin centering a

1972.379 --> 1975.4399999999998
station that you wound up effective

1974.089 --> 1978.349
negative which is what I told you is

1975.44 --> 1979.5800000000002
she's taught correctly it recycles and

1978.349 --> 1982.129
stuff in the first four five years even

1979.58 --> 1985.74
itself so after after that ostrich

1982.129 --> 1989.4599999999998
energy has no negative connotation

1985.74 --> 1992.669
right and you also stressed on phonetics

1989.46 --> 1995.429
phonetics is very very important so how

1992.669 --> 1997.2
do we push politics for example you know

1995.429 --> 1999.929
talking about swathi nakshatra how do

1997.2 --> 2000.799
you use phonetics and swathi no shelter

1999.929 --> 2002.51
okay swathi

2000.799 --> 2005.36
let's say so many so anything swathi is

2002.51 --> 2009.169
okay it's ready to serve swathi because

2005.36 --> 2011.57
my name is Felicity Terra and swathi and

2009.169 --> 2013.669
Sarah became Abraham and Sarah in the

2011.57 --> 2016.46
night normal thing Abraham was Rama and

2013.669 --> 2018.8600000000001
Sarah is Saraswathi and Watty

2016.46 --> 2020.63
is like all the musicality of Saraswathi

2018.86 --> 2022.4289999999999
we'll be there in Swati moochers or

2020.63 --> 2025.909
anything to that it means to be English

2022.429 --> 2029.21
find out from there SWA a--they Swami in

2025.909 --> 2031.5800000000002
self show me like they're going well

2029.21 --> 2034.159
going okay so you can tell that itself

2031.58 --> 2039.4089999999999
going like that can thing it is a why

2034.159 --> 2042.44
was that right right you know in that

2039.409 --> 2045.0490000000002
way and then the whole thing about

2042.44 --> 2047.75
genetics is like you know their each nut

2045.049 --> 2050.389
chakra is connected to some sounds so

2047.75 --> 2052.609
like if the first sound is there with a

2050.389 --> 2056.48
sound is there with Putra harmony right

2052.609 --> 2061.45
you know II know I said who the

2056.48 --> 2065.389
needs access now P the letter P is

2061.45 --> 2067.25
access anyway wouldn't the word comes

2065.389 --> 2069.5
from you know each current NP like

2067.25 --> 2072.409
hiding in a circle around it now the

2069.5 --> 2074.54
circle rotates on the line right H point

2072.409 --> 2076.429
right with the axis and that circle go

2074.54 --> 2080.57
getting around it that's what he is and

2076.429 --> 2084.56
it is connected with ultra follow me on

2080.57 --> 2085.55
a random think example like if you take

2084.56 --> 2090.52
any sound like rah

2085.55 --> 2094.849
like rasam like like rise the Sun

2090.52 --> 2096.679
Egyptians okay in the Vedic thing what

2094.849 --> 2099.1090000000004
is wrong the same thing becomes wrong

2096.679 --> 2101.9300000000003
ROM game for one their line of the Sun

2099.109 --> 2105.5299999999997
cage so everyone she's rankings for the

2101.93 --> 2106.3999999999996
same thing Sun kings in Egypt Allah Ya

2105.53 --> 2108.32
Allah

2106.4 --> 2110.869
yeah yeah which is the same thing it's

2108.32 --> 2112.849
the same thing actually yeah and are is

2110.869 --> 2115.4300000000003
a rotation right later

2112.849 --> 2117.05
in sanskrit also is allah and in english

2115.43 --> 2119.2999999999997
or throw it's a rotation we same

2117.05 --> 2123.38
rotation and that rotation is from

2119.3 --> 2126.3500000000004
to matter Wow when you rotate light you

2123.38 --> 2128.09
get into matter ingesting nothing but

2126.35 --> 2131.42
rotating light that is the concept of

2128.09 --> 2133.1000000000004
that's that's our son makes that our son

2131.42 --> 2135.17
like create photosynthesis becomes food

2133.1 --> 2137.0
it that rotation of a straight light

2135.17 --> 2138.89
into that thing so I mean these things

2137.0 --> 2142.43
like if you say curve for example curve

2138.89 --> 2144.3799999999997
yeah guys charge he come he's charged

2142.43 --> 2146.5099999999998
charged you know that's what is the

2144.38 --> 2147.29
first letter of the Dave Nagri sense

2146.51 --> 2150.86
together

2147.29 --> 2154.2799999999997
so cut its charge and like if you saber

2150.86 --> 2156.98
for example burr be its waked by his

2154.28 --> 2160.9700000000003
means make and that's where the word

2156.98 --> 2164.02
Kabbalah II spirit is the amount of

2160.97 --> 2167.0299999999997
coherent charge in any way

2164.02 --> 2170.45
amount of spirit and he being has yeah

2167.03 --> 2173.5400000000004
is the coherent charge there you know

2170.45 --> 2174.77
but the car thing is always charged if

2173.54 --> 2176.39
you don't understand phonetics and the

2174.77 --> 2177.83
root meanings of words and terms

2176.39 --> 2179.39
and you trying to understand up to

2177.83 --> 2180.95
threads you're not going anywhere again

2179.39 --> 2183.41
I'm just giving you an example then

2180.95 --> 2185.48
correctly of like it you don't

2183.41 --> 2187.5499999999997
understand them things from so many

2185.48 --> 2190.61
different other angles I'm sure you know

2187.55 --> 2192.1400000000003
you can't study in Exeter so next uh D

2190.61 --> 2194.36
of nap sectors or dotage is not a study

2192.14 --> 2198.56
of voltage or nitrogen its study of

2194.36 --> 2200.33
everything as a whole right yeah and if

2198.56 --> 2202.79
you have that knowledge as a whole of

2200.33 --> 2204.92
different things then community can only

2202.79 --> 2207.2
you can include interest in the natural

2204.92 --> 2207.83
book I just gave like it's like a

2207.2 --> 2210.83
trailer

2207.83 --> 2212.21
yeah minor to the to a movie like it's

2210.83 --> 2214.61
like a trailer I'm giving you a little

2212.21 --> 2220.88
bit of hints when can we see the movie

2214.61 --> 2223.76
then can you see the whole movie like I

2220.88 --> 2225.77
mean my love whole life and I might live

2223.76 --> 2228.26
my life that are like that move ready

2225.77 --> 2229.7
for somebody channel on YouTube channel

2228.26 --> 2232.9700000000003
stuff like they'll see a movie they'll

2229.7 --> 2234.2599999999998
see all kinds of things which is or it

2232.97 --> 2234.47
may read might be logs or things like

2234.26 --> 2236.48
that

2234.47 --> 2238.25
like then that is a whole lot of

2236.48 --> 2240.05
different aspects to it but then there

2238.25 --> 2241.07
are so many aspects to it which like can

2240.05 --> 2243.5
only be learned in tourism for example

2241.07 --> 2244.82
in the ancient for Emperor I like it was

2243.5 --> 2245.27
Guru shishya parampara like where you

2244.82 --> 2247.4900000000002
actually

2245.27 --> 2248.99
gurus are actually speaking and then you

2247.49 --> 2250.3999999999996
are hearing and that's how learning

2248.99 --> 2252.74
happens and that's how I think learning

2250.4 --> 2253.85
happens on a interaction level

2252.74 --> 2256.25
that's only better than happen through

2253.85 --> 2258.6189999999997
books something like oh you know I'm

2256.25 --> 2261.56
happy right now

2258.619 --> 2263.81
oh it's something the growth going on

2261.56 --> 2265.94
yes I think that's only bad happens or

2263.81 --> 2266.21
it can work you cannot work any other

2265.94 --> 2268.79
way

2266.21 --> 2271.04
like if you go and people go to browsing

2268.79 --> 2272.66
Google and there's so much info out

2271.04 --> 2274.1
there but there's so much misinformed

2272.66 --> 2275.45
there is that how will you know which is

2274.1 --> 2278.33
information because this information

2275.45 --> 2279.77
correctly and I came with books then

2278.33 --> 2282.29
with same with everything all of that

2279.77 --> 2283.79
you know so something which is like when

2282.29 --> 2285.68
guru and I think should happen about

2283.79 --> 2288.56
there everything happened for my actual

2285.68 --> 2290.72
real basis like up from basics are

2288.56 --> 2292.85
strengthened then you are given that

2290.72 --> 2293.8999999999996
thing and you're given discernment then

2292.85 --> 2296.1189999999997
you were given all of these things and

2293.9 --> 2298.2200000000003
then accordingly things happen you know

2296.119 --> 2299.42
like I mean even in the book that's why

2298.22 --> 2302.4199999999996
I didn't give you much information in

2299.42 --> 2303.32
that book but I just ate pointers when I

2302.42 --> 2309.53
got it first

2303.32 --> 2311.54
enough for me on pointers just to like

2309.53 --> 2315.05
how it is there's a much bigger world

2311.54 --> 2316.0099999999998
this is a much bigger Worcester thing so

2315.05 --> 2318.8900000000003
that people come out of their little

2316.01 --> 2320.09
boxes right you know so whatever little

2318.89 --> 2321.71
box you are in like if you read

2320.09 --> 2323.03
somebody's a book deal or they'll think

2321.71 --> 2325.34
of it is something more to this all this

2323.03 --> 2327.1400000000003
that's all like this bomb and also is

2325.34 --> 2328.4300000000003
more to it like you know not wanted

2327.14 --> 2330.0499999999997
telling in school and stuff they're

2328.43 --> 2332.21
there and these all these planets and

2330.05 --> 2333.8300000000004
together and that's not a bore it is we

2332.21 --> 2335.359
actually realms like you're in a

2333.83 --> 2338.9
physical realm there are Ireland's there

2335.359 --> 2340.75
lower realms resins desktop planet is a

2338.9 --> 2343.64
plane and you know even in the last

2340.75 --> 2345.56
interview I had you know I had talked

2343.64 --> 2348.29
about that is actually flat and then it

2345.56 --> 2350.93
became very controversial amazing yeah

2348.29 --> 2353.27
but but it is like I mean it is a plane

2350.93 --> 2354.7999999999997
everybody the plane that's why it's

2353.27 --> 2357.89
called a planet it is very inherent in

2354.8 --> 2358.76
the word plane P plantain crossing yeah

2357.89 --> 2360.08
T is a crossing

2358.76 --> 2362.0
T Junction everybody knows what a

2360.08 --> 2365.5099999999998
t-junction yeah I mean all the English

2362.0 --> 2366.89
letters are what Denis Ward air drawn

2365.51 --> 2370.01
like that's what they are

2366.89 --> 2371.75
so if bees don't like dress mmm

2370.01 --> 2374.119
then the word breast Cassatt's would

2371.75 --> 2376.01
reunion yeah I mean English is a very

2374.119 --> 2377.3900000000003
scientific language in that way and so

2376.01 --> 2379.5200000000004
it stands there those are the two

2377.39 --> 2382.8199999999997
scientific languages English and sounds

2379.52 --> 2384.2599999999998
okay and they an English is even more

2382.82 --> 2386.51
scientific in certain ways because it

2384.26 --> 2388.5800000000004
has been combined to give them more

2386.51 --> 2391.5200000000004
like there's no word like fractal for

2388.58 --> 2392.7799999999997
example in some sense it doesn't have

2391.52 --> 2396.95
any equivalent of the world tracking

2392.78 --> 2398.51
right okay because since Capo's add 40

2396.95 --> 2400.3399999999997
she goes oh it was a evolving language

2398.51 --> 2403.1000000000004
it is not a completed language new words

2400.34 --> 2404.84
had to be made in something because

2403.1 --> 2407.96
originally I think it was called as fat

2404.84 --> 2409.94
curd is introduced for us but it's it's

2407.96 --> 2412.4
evolving language it's still not

2409.94 --> 2414.5
finished and English is not either for

2412.4 --> 2415.88
your English as it because more inputs

2414.5 --> 2417.2
have come in from the Egyptian thing

2415.88 --> 2418.7000000000003
from the Latin thing from the that is

2417.2 --> 2420.5299999999997
which is the Egyptian only and all of

2418.7 --> 2424.1
that so it is getting more words like

2420.53 --> 2426.17
Phi Phi that fractal and all of that all

2424.1 --> 2428.2999999999997
of those things words came and raha has

2426.17 --> 2432.35
come and occurred like English and all

2428.3 --> 2434.8700000000003
of a else in years right you know I mean

2432.35 --> 2435.68
so like L is actually energy of the

2434.87 --> 2438.89
colony here

2435.68 --> 2442.45
okay yeah so EA L is like that one and a

2438.89 --> 2446.45
half turn beautiful liquid serpent right

2442.45 --> 2448.6099999999997
okay and so the word elder meant the bee

2446.45 --> 2450.5299999999997
pollen is a beacon Wow

2448.61 --> 2452.69
Oh elder didn't mean that the one who's

2450.53 --> 2454.25
older than you so like that you're

2452.69 --> 2455.93
supposed to respect your elders you know

2454.25 --> 2457.28
what just suppose respective olders but

2455.93 --> 2458.72
by Indian thing you have to respect

2457.28 --> 2461.51
older only because you don't understand

2458.72 --> 2463.0099999999998
any of this yeah like an Indian that

2461.51 --> 2464.7200000000003
thing means like just to take the older

2463.01 --> 2467.09
which is not because older might be

2464.72 --> 2468.29
totally mad and nothing what is what are

2467.09 --> 2469.94
you gonna do about that why would you

2468.29 --> 2472.13
just like that so English English a

2469.94 --> 2474.5
separate word for elder and older and

2472.13 --> 2477.5
Indian Indy knows that words existed

2474.5 --> 2479.12
right you know for elder and older like

2477.5 --> 2480.8
so they don't understand what the

2479.12 --> 2482.3599999999997
meaning differences like these people

2480.8 --> 2484.19
are more engaged than me or these people

2482.36 --> 2485.9300000000003
know something more than me or they : is

2484.19 --> 2487.58
awakened so they're a different more

2485.93 --> 2491.5699999999997
rewarding right

2487.58 --> 2493.34
there's no separations for that so I'm

2491.57 --> 2496.13
just giving some examples and in that

2493.34 --> 2499.28
how language language the word language

2496.13 --> 2501.02
even comes from land gauge right how the

2499.28 --> 2502.13
land every time you speak a language you

2501.02 --> 2504.92
actually program

2502.13 --> 2508.01
right you are programming yourself every

2504.92 --> 2509.7200000000003
time you speak something have you got

2508.01 --> 2511.34
any examples that you can show you know

2509.72 --> 2514.33
how do you know J is also associated

2511.34 --> 2517.46
with is there something that you see I

2514.33 --> 2518.93
mean always I mean it's always gonna be

2517.46 --> 2520.56
connect you can look at anything like I

2518.93 --> 2525.1499999999996
mean Barney is the

2520.56 --> 2527.91
not Chester like so it's - yeah - Unni

2525.15 --> 2531.75
my son is that thing is what is 180s

2527.91 --> 2535.2
connected eight one two - twini's one

2531.75 --> 2538.77
you can get validation the cooler

2535.2 --> 2540.6
masculine principle very like no new

2538.77 --> 2541.95
Midori son will be with associate with

2540.6 --> 2543.42
number one then so which is the more

2541.95 --> 2544.35
masculine principle and then the

2543.42 --> 2548.37
feminine principle is the lunar

2544.35 --> 2552.0
principle moon so moon exalted in the

2548.37 --> 2553.83
second sang that's one interns yeah like

2552.0 --> 2557.34
just like son gets in the first one yeah

2553.83 --> 2559.11
own guessing right the nut shortage is

2557.34 --> 2561.9900000000002
there more rowing in which is moon that

2559.11 --> 2566.1
thing yeah yeah which is the what number

2561.99 --> 2569.24
is electroni number four number four

2566.1 --> 2570.69
okay so one two will be coming for right

2569.24 --> 2573.87
everybody likes that

2570.69 --> 2576.96
yeah buddy wants one to become food to

2573.87 --> 2579.5099999999998
become a to become whatever everybody

2576.96 --> 2583.32
want that in one to go for like into the

2579.51 --> 2585.1800000000003
core yeah Roni gives that thing that's

2583.32 --> 2588.42
why like I mean you understand like you

2585.18 --> 2590.49
so I mean so the numbers will never that

2588.42 --> 2591.9900000000002
thing I mean you go to the numbers you

2590.49 --> 2594.5099999999998
will get to the pic picture of that

2591.99 --> 2596.3399999999997
thing you know right you guys creative

2594.51 --> 2599.25
then it is for the five energy in it

2596.34 --> 2601.52
it's a you know which one written on

2599.25 --> 2607.32
your fine yeah like so then it will

2601.52 --> 2609.09
automatically be created degrees or the

2607.32 --> 2612.1200000000003
fifth house the same thing like all of

2609.09 --> 2613.83
that will keep on coming never not

2612.12 --> 2616.17
combine with each other perfectly

2613.83 --> 2620.79
coming to Oh Arthur which is the number

2616.17 --> 2622.71
six yeah yeah and the axis of Arthur in

2620.79 --> 2626.16
moola you know moolah they say is the

2622.71 --> 2627.54
center of our galaxy so what have you

2626.16 --> 2631.64
seen anything because you talked about

2627.54 --> 2634.17
the access of a Bhadrapada and Albany

2631.64 --> 2636.93
because you see the male dog and the

2634.17 --> 2639.4500000000003
female dog nuna and Audra

2636.93 --> 2642.8599999999997
so is there some connection where the

2639.45 --> 2646.14
swords coming from and out for long that

2642.86 --> 2651.11
like because otherwise be degrees like

2646.14 --> 2651.1099999999997
we can use net is the Quran or I am here

2651.29 --> 2657.119
and said Oh God

2653.549 --> 2660.899
whereas it is that is on which Souls

2657.119 --> 2662.6400000000003
enter and leave Wow earth plane and and

2660.899 --> 2667.019
that's why the Egyptians had so much

2662.64 --> 2668.3089999999997
attention on Orion Ryan yeah and

2667.019 --> 2671.0989999999997
everything for a pharaoh they rose at

2668.309 --> 2676.099
the pyramids pointing toward your eye

2671.099 --> 2678.63
and see they want a soul to immediately

2676.099 --> 2680.429
out you know because they didn't want

2678.63 --> 2681.4790000000003
rebirth which is they don't want like

2680.429 --> 2682.859
the cycle of birth and death

2681.479 --> 2684.209
so they want when they want out they

2682.859 --> 2685.439
want out to the higher planes of the

2684.209 --> 2687.5389999999998
immortal world they don't want to come

2685.439 --> 2689.8799999999997
back please the game's physical to two

2687.539 --> 2691.6490000000003
gates or hang it and the moola game they

2689.88 --> 2693.539
say they are two gates and that's a ship

2691.649 --> 2695.509
collie counterpart night shift will be

2693.539 --> 2698.6400000000003
Audra and Kali will be a whole ship

2695.509 --> 2701.13
energy is actually the nine six and

2698.64 --> 2704.0989999999997
other creates chaos and commotion and

2701.13 --> 2705.839
rings like that which people associate

2704.099 --> 2707.5190000000002
with 6000 people don't like 6000 a chart

2705.839 --> 2709.199
that way and it's the same kind of thing

2707.519 --> 2710.8489999999997
you know slow so people don't like that

2709.199 --> 2713.429
like that much thank you thing but it is

2710.849 --> 2717.089
necessary energy right and it is charge

2713.429 --> 2719.849
as well charge and chop that thing you

2717.089 --> 2722.0589999999997
know I'm for example like I have like me

2719.849 --> 2724.1090000000004
my penis and Agra and right go I own

2722.059 --> 2726.1490000000003
electrical that thing now we touched a

2724.109 --> 2727.979
guitar and play electric stuff only like

2726.149 --> 2730.5589999999997
aya because who me is like a shifting

2727.979 --> 2732.1789999999996
electrician right right so so that is

2730.559 --> 2734.009
that is the whole thing so Audra has its

2732.179 --> 2735.569
own that thing in that place like and

2734.009 --> 2737.699
the Orang connection is there I mean

2735.569 --> 2739.769
they're long layers to each naturally

2737.699 --> 2741.059
like that which you can go into like

2739.769 --> 2742.1989999999996
more and more depends on how much you

2741.059 --> 2744.179
know how much do you actually know about

2742.199 --> 2745.679
the multiverse you're living in which

2744.179 --> 2747.2090000000003
people know very little right now people

2745.679 --> 2748.9790000000003
have a very little idea of where we are

2747.209 --> 2751.919
so that's why the whole discussion with

2748.979 --> 2754.229
us becomes very difficult because the

2751.919 --> 2755.8489999999997
lack of knowledge in all associated in

2754.229 --> 2757.229
science is not there properly people

2755.849 --> 2758.88
home evaluation was holding a conch in

2757.229 --> 2760.8889999999997
his hand yeah he's holding a costume is

2758.88 --> 2762.809
n because poon conscious golden ratio

2760.889 --> 2765.389
it's a potent fire okay so it's Phi

2762.809 --> 2767.099
ratio initiative you know which is what

2765.389 --> 2768.4790000000003
the nation works on so if they have that

2767.099 --> 2769.199
image they would not even understand

2768.479 --> 2770.6989999999996
what that means

2769.199 --> 2772.7090000000003
like you know the symbology the thing is

2770.699 --> 2774.509
that without the science without the

2772.709 --> 2776.1589999999997
actual knowing and without that thing

2774.509 --> 2778.469
one can't understand X which was likely

2776.159 --> 2780.359
she's understood that so do you see a

2778.469 --> 2784.469
connection with what you mentioned about

2780.359 --> 2786.95
psy and this pattern that you see in the

2784.469 --> 2789.0190000000002
file is there any connection with

2786.95 --> 2791.21
who nervous because that is a again

2789.019 --> 2796.339
about reputation messenger pattern

2791.21 --> 2798.98
meeting so it is coming back to the

2796.339 --> 2801.339
thing like a boomerang yeah the

2798.98 --> 2803.839
boomerang it comes back to you you know

2801.339 --> 2807.71
good Karma's good Karma's will come back

2803.839 --> 2810.92
to you throw whatever so is the lack of

2807.71 --> 2813.95
that thing repetition right polar owner

2810.92 --> 2815.9
and bool again good again or never good

2813.95 --> 2818.8689999999997
again so so it's like a change of

2815.9 --> 2821.2400000000002
direction like um say like if you were

2818.869 --> 2824.2690000000002
going down on downward path you stop any

2821.24 --> 2826.609
change rich right towards an upward path

2824.269 --> 2828.519
that games correctly I mean even that

2826.609 --> 2831.44
shall make that change

2828.519 --> 2832.64
he was use humility being made the

2831.44 --> 2835.43
change after that he did pow Boosh it

2832.64 --> 2837.44
afterwards right right whatever sue is

2835.43 --> 2839.5389999999998
that which happens after a brownie

2837.44 --> 2841.279
here's another all the happens

2839.539 --> 2842.96
writing emphasis yeah all that that

2841.279 --> 2844.339
thing happens and then followers who is

2842.96 --> 2847.21
the that thing which comes out of that

2844.339 --> 2849.619
you know the final result but

2847.21 --> 2851.45
interesting yeah yeah and the Phi ratio

2849.619 --> 2854.1800000000003
is definitely connected with both those

2851.45 --> 2856.16
natural other and pull over so that all

2854.18 --> 2858.14
right okay both would not be nice with a

2856.16 --> 2860.1499999999996
bone yeah yeah yeah

2858.14 --> 2863.42
so it will be connected to both yeah I

2860.15 --> 2866.9300000000003
mean no I I wanted to ask you another

2863.42 --> 2869.089
question that when you look at all the

2866.93 --> 2871.22
nakshatras okay the twenty-seven

2869.089 --> 2873.3089999999997
nutshell is that we have every nutria

2871.22 --> 2877.609
has a male and a female counterpart

2873.309 --> 2879.8900000000003
except for one this is nada which is a

2877.609 --> 2882.3489999999997
male moose it doesn't have a female

2879.89 --> 2883.7
counterpart is there any way that we can

2882.349 --> 2885.9500000000003
interpret this what does your

2883.7 --> 2889.4199999999996
interpretation rush what do you hope you

2885.95 --> 2891.6189999999997
see a good thrush ha as a notch okay

2889.42 --> 2894.259
there are two ways we can see it first

2891.619 --> 2896.63
like okay hotel has another animal which

2894.259 --> 2898.73
I associate with it is elephant yeah

2896.63 --> 2900.4100000000003
okay now elephant has milking them so

2898.73 --> 2903.23
that aspect is their Putra Shara is

2900.41 --> 2905.269
mostly about victory of divine or evil

2903.23 --> 2907.88
mood over bad and that is its basic that

2905.269 --> 2908.839
victory over guru over even or put over

2907.88 --> 2911.2690000000002
bad or things like that

2908.839 --> 2912.769
sure but what that one has to have an

2911.269 --> 2914.14
understanding of what is good on what is

2912.769 --> 2915.85
that

2914.14 --> 2918.1299999999997
right now people don't know what is good

2915.85 --> 2919.93
what is bad right now like Hanukkah game

2918.13 --> 2921.37
will to consist cops and robbers cops

2919.93 --> 2922.99
are the good guys and robbers are the

2921.37 --> 2925.27
bad guys but robbers might be the good

2922.99 --> 2928.4799999999996
guys who knows what if cops are the bad

2925.27 --> 2929.83
guys right I mean with rush hour only

2928.48 --> 2931.39
works through divine judgment you know

2929.83 --> 2934.45
in divine this what is good what is bad

2931.39 --> 2938.98
not people or the human laws or man-made

2934.45 --> 2943.5099999999998
laws deciding this arise about like done

2938.98 --> 2945.4900000000002
as a whole from divine right not

2943.51 --> 2949.7400000000002
man-made laws but if you connect with

2945.49 --> 2952.66
man-made laws then you create sigh oh

2949.74 --> 2953.7999999999997
yeah yeah oh no you have to follow the

2952.66 --> 2955.0899999999997
law you have to follow this you have to

2953.8 --> 2957.28
follow this you have to follow that so

2955.09 --> 2959.53
other people will be just doing that in

2957.28 --> 2961.78
this world you know like about this

2959.53 --> 2963.34
thing but when it is not about this day

2961.78 --> 2965.59
Luther Azshara nest is about what is the

2963.34 --> 2967.33
divine dog now hope testing toward

2965.59 --> 2969.4900000000002
origin like if you do ask them what I'm

2967.33 --> 2972.58
telling you then that is the right thing

2969.49 --> 2974.4399999999996
or not by is own sense of it when Arjun

2972.58 --> 2976.5
had own sense of righteousness here

2974.44 --> 2979.57
which was not the real righteous yeah

2976.5 --> 2981.04
okay so that's what Krishna educates

2979.57 --> 2983.3500000000004
them about what is a real rags it method

2981.04 --> 2985.57
so that's what rich are at what about

2983.35 --> 2989.44
too much mana its predecessor how do you

2985.57 --> 2996.88
see that very organic energy per ampere

2989.44 --> 2998.88
energy already yeah which is why benas

2996.88 --> 3002.67
is there

2998.88 --> 3004.29
Venus evaporating right initially energy

3002.67 --> 3007.2000000000003
is there and Venus

3004.29 --> 3009.92
always gets thing if it gets a Jupiter

3007.2 --> 3012.1499999999996
base it gets better hmm

3009.92 --> 3015.15
and curvature like you know venus and

3012.15 --> 3019.2000000000003
jupiter car money yeah he did a sign and

3015.15 --> 3020.81
Venus okay and Vedas Venus get maximum

3019.2 --> 3023.97
voltage

3020.81 --> 3026.43
crisis by these Jupiter yep

3023.97 --> 3029.3999999999996
until when the gurus to gurus mean like

3026.43 --> 3030.12
so pooja Davila no love that thing more

3029.4 --> 3032.61
girls are together

3030.12 --> 3034.68
yeah shukracharya as well as breast

3032.61 --> 3037.56
fatigue and both gurus are together

3034.68 --> 3040.8599999999997
idiom plays a role of like that kind of

3037.56 --> 3043.41
energy like very upbeat very loud very

3040.86 --> 3045.0
vociferous really it is totally out and

3043.41 --> 3046.93
about in loud not gesture guru

3045.0 --> 3050.53
shukracharya was the

3046.93 --> 3052.54
of assurance and Beresford he was of the

3050.53 --> 3054.76
day was so do you see when the two gurus

3052.54 --> 3058.21
come together in put wash headaches they

3054.76 --> 3059.7700000000004
kind of give you these you know pull in

3058.21 --> 3064.9
different directions is there some

3059.77 --> 3066.52
connotation like that or is that in this

3064.9 --> 3070.42
Venus rules

3066.52 --> 3074.23
Oh Venus rules Jupiter provides the base

3070.42 --> 3076.329
and Venus rules and provider so that is

3074.23 --> 3081.099
how you look at every nook shuttle is

3076.329 --> 3084.9100000000003
you take the washi I mean this has the

3081.099 --> 3088.1800000000003
bay then left right next to throw that

3084.91 --> 3092.0499999999997
thing is going to the ocean like Pisces

3088.18 --> 3096.04
like ocean and the waves are there and

3092.05 --> 3099.04
the goddess is surfing on the waves so

3096.04 --> 3101.2599999999998
that is Aphrodite right yeah

3099.04 --> 3104.02
so that's Lakshmi as well that whole

3101.26 --> 3105.849
Venus same thing comes on top of it so

3104.02 --> 3108.96
the rules are very clear in both who is

3105.849 --> 3111.6600000000003
where then that makes it three

3108.96 --> 3114.28
nakshatras we talked about with Arab

3111.66 --> 3116.5299999999997
Anthony and no you talked about who are

3114.28 --> 3118.78
again again the Lakshmi energy and

3116.53 --> 3122.02
surprisingly you see many charts I've

3118.78 --> 3125.049
seen how you know the super-wealthy

3122.02 --> 3126.91
you find is from some of these

3125.049 --> 3129.22
nakshatras become very prominent you

3126.91 --> 3133.0299999999997
know a bother about the you know a

3129.22 --> 3136.1189999999997
goonie who has had a syndrome in e you

3133.03 --> 3138.4900000000002
know yeah I mean by the thing is yeah

3136.119 --> 3139.9
that is the thing but right now money

3138.49 --> 3140.74
has become the netting of that because

3139.9 --> 3141.48
that's me is nothing to do with money

3140.74 --> 3146.41
first

3141.48 --> 3148.839
okay she's no no Lakshmi has nothing do

3146.41 --> 3151.27
with money like Lakshmi Lakshmi just

3148.839 --> 3155.95
Lakshmi just means black share that she

3151.27 --> 3158.19
means in goal goal goal and getting of

3155.95 --> 3160.499
the goal right

3158.19 --> 3163.44
now right now getting money has become

3160.499 --> 3168.18
one of the goals moons it's gonna become

3163.44 --> 3169.109
one of the goals it has become way a

3168.18 --> 3170.8799999999997
bowl for people

3169.109 --> 3171.8089999999997
okay right so then people are calling

3170.88 --> 3176.339
that and then people are calling that

3171.809 --> 3178.2290000000003
much right yeah cool is like okay your

3176.339 --> 3180.269
bowl is like I have to get knowledge or

3178.229 --> 3182.0989999999997
if I have to get into higher words I

3180.269 --> 3183.8999999999996
don't want to another cycle of birth and

3182.099 --> 3186.299
death out there I want to go to pain

3183.9 --> 3189.39
inhale and torture if you these are your

3186.299 --> 3192.2889999999998
bowls then Lakshmi will give that and

3189.39 --> 3193.499
let's means actually for that right

3192.289 --> 3195.4500000000003
right

3193.499 --> 3197.999
they interest it yet you just ya know

3195.45 --> 3200.759
not what these kind of goes okay but

3197.999 --> 3202.769
since people make that they're both

3200.759 --> 3207.329
money then these enough checkers will

3202.769 --> 3208.6499999999996
give that right because they're what is

3207.329 --> 3212.549
their thing getting is gold should be

3208.65 --> 3214.589
fulfilled whatever the goal may be yeah

3212.549 --> 3217.47
you know being said brings me to the

3214.589 --> 3220.529
next one more nakshatra which is done

3217.47 --> 3224.64
Easter stop the money is money

3220.529 --> 3226.079
what do you mean sound so finished and I

3224.64 --> 3228.1189999999997
think you mentioned about Ganesha and

3226.079 --> 3230.19
you had some special insights that you

3228.119 --> 3231.0190000000002
wanted to share with us specific with

3230.19 --> 3237.2690000000002
the kneestr

3231.019 --> 3238.7099999999996
yeah damaged is like it's the beat the

3237.269 --> 3241.6499999999996
beat rhythm

3238.71 --> 3244.65
yeah and it's a ship not you know it

3241.65 --> 3247.0190000000002
ships energy right ships dumbu is that's

3244.65 --> 3249.119
vanished RSB yeah now that's a be good

3247.019 --> 3251.43
time is the beep damaged tiles Aquarius

3249.119 --> 3255.42
it's that ship in it is it Madison

3251.43 --> 3257.339
energetic it's there everything you

3255.42 --> 3259.41
would be Tony and that thing and time

3257.339 --> 3260.7889999999998
and time pose so even if you think of

3259.41 --> 3263.0989999999997
like this time this is nothing that is

3260.789 --> 3265.4100000000003
this time one time one thing happens and

3263.099 --> 3266.67
all of that that comes with them Tony

3265.41 --> 3268.529
so then they do this will come under

3266.67 --> 3270.9300000000003
that too because its timing it's real

3268.529 --> 3272.67
suffering and you time is like getting a

3270.93 --> 3274.799
time body if you want to create time

3272.67 --> 3277.2290000000003
body likes to buy the time body where

3274.799 --> 3278.759
events actually or in place according to

3277.229 --> 3280.14
these kind of things and these kind of

3278.759 --> 3281.099
patterns all these kind of things so

3280.14 --> 3283.589
knowing what those patterns and

3281.099 --> 3286.349
everything is vanished and it's music -

3283.589 --> 3288.93
yes beat and music and all of that

3286.349 --> 3291.029
so those things both things come you

3288.93 --> 3291.72
know it's done is actually done of

3291.029 --> 3295.67
knowledge

3291.72 --> 3299.6899999999996
right okay so well Oh

3295.67 --> 3303.089
knowledge knowledge yeah that's the done

3299.69 --> 3305.25
in tastic okay next done is what

3303.089 --> 3308.79
Chevron chief done is what knowledge

3305.25 --> 3310.109
knowledge yeah yeah that's enough which

3308.79 --> 3312.05
which is in the second house people say

3310.109 --> 3313.47
accumulated second house is how the well

3312.05 --> 3315.75
yeah

3313.47 --> 3318.5989999999997
nowadays it become bank accounts right

3315.75 --> 3320.579
yeah earlier it was like knowledge like

3318.599 --> 3322.349
how much knowledge you are yeah this

3320.579 --> 3324.2400000000002
same house different meanings in the

3322.349 --> 3326.069
census of what they are like right now

3324.24 --> 3327.6299999999997
or what they use and the same things

3326.069 --> 3328.95
which happen in other Jewish parts of

3327.63 --> 3334.1400000000003
builders like same things happen enough

3328.95 --> 3335.7599999999998
to throw that same nonsense which goes

3334.14 --> 3337.44
into these other things it keeps on

3335.76 --> 3340.44
percolating in two notches as well many

3337.44 --> 3342.839
people just acknowledge bag now actually

3340.44 --> 3345.27
put things together or make sense of

3342.839 --> 3346.68
these things because they lack knowledge

3345.27 --> 3347.73
of so many other subjects

3346.68 --> 3349.5299999999997
they have to have like the Apple our

3347.73 --> 3350.7
mythology complete no numbers they have

3349.53 --> 3351.8100000000004
to know if they're not penetrates they

3350.7 --> 3353.6699999999996
have to know the root meanings of words

3351.81 --> 3356.97
example is you go to a there are physics

3353.67 --> 3359.01
in any university and tell me what does

3356.97 --> 3360.5989999999997
physics mean just one question like what

3359.01 --> 3362.6400000000003
is physics they were more know protists

3360.599 --> 3364.1090000000004
of any university in the world will not

3362.64 --> 3365.7
know what physics me so people are that

3364.109 --> 3367.23
disconnected from the rule they are

3365.7 --> 3369.54
supposedly expert in something but they

3367.23 --> 3371.099
don't know anything about it even the

3369.54 --> 3375.54
word physics the word physics comes from

3371.099 --> 3379.17
PI right why ratio and CX mean from that

3375.54 --> 3382.589
word scissor cutting cutting of Y ratio

3379.17 --> 3387.54
right knocking up of that pie ratios in

3382.589 --> 3389.04
various ways is physics interesting so I

3387.54 --> 3390.359
mean but people don't know any of these

3389.04 --> 3390.69
things so they they don't even know what

3390.359 --> 3392.7
they've

3390.69 --> 3394.29
topic they're dealing with right now

3392.7 --> 3396.1189999999997
such compartmentalization has been

3394.29 --> 3397.29
created in the world okay they say

3396.119 --> 3399.6600000000003
physics is different from chemistry is

3397.29 --> 3402.329
different from mathematics right that be

3399.66 --> 3403.95
I mean how can chemistry and physics be

3402.329 --> 3406.53
that thing or biology bit did you know

3403.95 --> 3408.96
this I mean it just makes no sense

3406.53 --> 3411.03
I mean in the ancient meeting with no

3408.96 --> 3412.38
cell compartmentalization exist existed

3411.03 --> 3413.88
in the first thing it's like not like

3412.38 --> 3415.08
assuming tomorrow's will have to know do

3413.88 --> 3418.38
this yeah

3415.08 --> 3420.7799999999997
there no has to - right they'll know

3418.38 --> 3422.52
helps to a low-mass - pear no divine

3420.78 --> 3424.5600000000004
signs - you know I mean there's nothing

3422.52 --> 3426.54
they would not know in order to do what

3424.56 --> 3427.5299999999997
they have to do so what do you have to

3426.54 --> 3430.32
say about Shobana

3427.53 --> 3432.119
you know the learning I mean what would

3430.32 --> 3433.349
be a what we were talking about I said

3432.119 --> 3435.42
like knowledge can only be passed

3433.349 --> 3437.46
through listening and listening Gurukul

3435.42 --> 3438.9900000000002
system only that way this can be done

3437.46 --> 3441.51
because for it to unbend in your brain

3438.99 --> 3442.7999999999997
because like if you listening to

3441.51 --> 3444.21
something and somebody doesn't

3442.8 --> 3445.8300000000004
understand something or it's

3444.21 --> 3449.31
misunderstanding that there will be look

3445.83 --> 3450.75
and direct it in something right then

3449.31 --> 3454.56
the student will speak and then guru

3450.75 --> 3458.67
will hear that and then correct it

3454.56 --> 3459.84
that's right you eat some sentence now

3458.67 --> 3461.2200000000003
you can interpret it in any which way

3459.84 --> 3462.96
you want it is nobody there to correct

3461.22 --> 3464.73
you you were just with yourself then so

3462.96 --> 3467.31
that that way things can't really happen

3464.73 --> 3472.89
very so yeah and trouble is the most

3467.31 --> 3475.339
that's the learning right if you will be

3472.89 --> 3478.29
learning practical learning particularly

3475.339 --> 3480.21
it's not - no it's common sensical it's

3478.29 --> 3483.45
practical its gray satin is there it has

3480.21 --> 3484.7400000000002
to be actually real if you don't have

3483.45 --> 3486.21
that shovin process if you have not gone

3484.74 --> 3487.9199999999996
through the whole that thing you can't

3486.21 --> 3489.45
put that into action or put there into

3487.92 --> 3491.2200000000003
process people are not good listeners

3489.45 --> 3492.6899999999996
these days anyway people need very

3491.22 --> 3494.7
something very fast then listening

3492.69 --> 3495.9900000000002
capacity is not there as a whole that

3494.7 --> 3498.66
brings me back when she was talking to

3495.99 --> 3499.9799999999996
Parvati II then he would be talking for

3498.66 --> 3501.0299999999997
like thousands of years now she asked

3499.98 --> 3503.01
him listen for thousands of years and

3501.03 --> 3504.9900000000002
have a rockin stuff not have got the

3503.01 --> 3505.349
knowledge of do this from like even

3504.99 --> 3506.9399999999996
parasha

3505.349 --> 3508.6800000000003
so haurache after if you say the first

3506.94 --> 3510.9
that thing it starts with chips ocupado

3508.68 --> 3513.27
yeah that's correct yeah that that's how

3510.9 --> 3514.98
it starts like ships spoke like so then

3513.27 --> 3516.48
then listening ability has to be there

3514.98 --> 3518.39
that's why can be guru poverty only

3516.48 --> 3520.92
like who can listen for that long II

3518.39 --> 3522.81
like people like will fall asleep right

3520.92 --> 3523.859
now if somebody start speaking then that

3522.81 --> 3525.089
thing and if they go keep on going

3523.859 --> 3526.71
deeper deeper deeper deeper than then

3525.089 --> 3528.0299999999997
we're gonna half an hour two hours

3526.71 --> 3529.38
they'll fall asleep it will be too much

3528.03 --> 3530.9100000000003
for them that's where the listening

3529.38 --> 3533.52
gates which new thing is like it's got

3530.91 --> 3535.0499999999997
eternal listening all the time like this

3533.52 --> 3537.49
to get always listen he's lying on his

3535.05 --> 3539.69
that thing but he never forces me

3537.49 --> 3542.75
even though he's lying on bed he doesn't

3539.69 --> 3545.2400000000002
fall asleep normal rates we put them on

3542.75 --> 3548.03
them within five minutes they'll be yeah

3545.24 --> 3550.52
go let strangers yeah yeah because the

3548.03 --> 3552.59
hearing abilities it yeah so if fish

3550.52 --> 3553.85
speaking to Lakshmi then let's meet this

3552.59 --> 3555.77
thing a flash me speak then Vishnu

3553.85 --> 3558.08
listens and Vishnu system to the whole

3555.77 --> 3559.31
world is that mean whatever I mean the

3558.08 --> 3560.7799999999997
whole world he was as a whole is

3559.31 --> 3562.61
continuously listened to and that's why

3560.78 --> 3564.59
he's smiling - because he's hearing all

3562.61 --> 3566.6
of that as a whole so that's why it's

3564.59 --> 3568.13
fish news not just them because ship is

3566.6 --> 3570.74
speaking more okay

3568.13 --> 3573.38
it was not much into listening and wish

3570.74 --> 3575.24
to is into listening yeah yeah ship is

3573.38 --> 3576.9500000000003
speaking conversely is yes all the

3575.24 --> 3578.1499999999996
knowledge is open the third eye and that

3576.95 --> 3580.37
thing from that or the knowledge ketone

3578.15 --> 3582.65
coming out legs you know they're hearing

3580.37 --> 3584.93
out like yeah which poverty has to

3582.65 --> 3586.4900000000002
contend with right so that's the

3584.93 --> 3589.8999999999996
difference between so that's why Shravan

3586.49 --> 3594.9199999999996
and damage to the Nesta is shaken

3589.9 --> 3597.05
together and then how about Sutton what

3594.92 --> 3599.9
do you see such a vicious energy to be a

3597.05 --> 3602.78
shock is a very very death it's like

3599.9 --> 3604.58
radio waves x-ray all of that things you

3602.78 --> 3606.32
can't see you but you can't see radio

3604.58 --> 3608.72
waves even when your radio is catching

3606.32 --> 3610.82
AM FM and that thing it the base comes

3608.72 --> 3613.58
of that I think they go up and they come

3610.82 --> 3615.7400000000002
back you ain't seen it all beyond your

3613.58 --> 3618.86
visual aural

3615.74 --> 3621.68
range Sigma thing interesting in just

3618.86 --> 3623.4500000000003
yeah that's how the realms are I mean

3621.68 --> 3625.37
right now there are they can be other

3623.45 --> 3627.3199999999997
beings existing which are panel to us in

3625.37 --> 3628.7599999999998
this world they exist they are in your

3627.32 --> 3631.3700000000003
room they can be in this room but you

3628.76 --> 3633.0200000000004
can see that what sort of be instant you

3631.37 --> 3634.31
will see they're all kind of beings and

3633.02 --> 3635.09
all of elementals and things which exist

3634.31 --> 3636.7999999999997
in this world

3635.09 --> 3638.42
right on the earth own but we could not

3636.8 --> 3639.4700000000003
see that that is all shot by shot for

3638.42 --> 3642.86
human being right

3639.47 --> 3646.0699999999997
oh this is really brilliant didn't get

3642.86 --> 3647.7200000000003
yeah okay okay okay and like shuttle

3646.07 --> 3650.57
means hundred like position hundred

3647.72 --> 3653.45
drink and I'm saying they're hundreds of

3650.57 --> 3655.73
me hundreds of time to be that's what it

3653.45 --> 3656.99
means shuttle hundreds or nice or types

3655.73 --> 3658.76
of these beings exist that's why don't

3656.99 --> 3661.4599999999996
you want to take one name or anything no

3658.76 --> 3663.2000000000003
we never never looked at shelter be sure

3661.46 --> 3665.84
from that angle zone you know this is

3663.2 --> 3668.2999999999997
absolutely fantastic insights that

3665.84 --> 3670.6400000000003
you're giving us which I'm not found in

3668.3 --> 3672.9500000000003
your book as well so I think

3670.64 --> 3674.93
in the book I I didn't even put 1% of

3672.95 --> 3677.18
anything in my book book book was a very

3674.93 --> 3679.18
just like a little that thing to dispel

3677.18 --> 3681.9199999999996
like what are the possibilities drink

3679.18 --> 3683.66
that little glimpse into the possibility

3681.92 --> 3684.9500000000003
that's all if I keep on speaking and

3683.66 --> 3686.45
somebody give them and that that book

3684.95 --> 3687.71
will be like more than combined with

3686.45 --> 3689.4199999999996
births or Shakespeare and you'll be like

3687.71 --> 3691.039
huge it will not be a book then it'll be

3689.42 --> 3692.96
something else like you usually like

3691.039 --> 3698.599
whole like rooms full of that thing to

3692.96 --> 3701.66
this thank you know we could even get to

3698.599 --> 3705.1090000000004
see even 2% of what you've been talking

3701.66 --> 3706.5789999999997
about I think that will be great for us

3705.109 --> 3707.93
the whole thing I can't even talk about

3706.579 --> 3708.98
because it valued one on techniques to

3707.93 --> 3710.18
another leads to another leads to

3708.98 --> 3712.789
another leads to another big issue other

3710.18 --> 3714.3489999999997
topic like so many things that it is a

3712.789 --> 3716.329
combined thing as a woman

3714.349 --> 3719.569
my point is just is that one should keep

3716.329 --> 3721.279
knowledge as a whole holistic just like

3719.569 --> 3722.839
even right now holistic living you know

3721.279 --> 3724.279
like if you have to live like healthy

3722.839 --> 3726.41
knee you have to be holistic the whole

3724.279 --> 3727.759
thing in the same way like you're taking

3726.41 --> 3729.6189999999997
what you eat what you drink where you

3727.759 --> 3731.119
staying what you're doing for everything

3729.619 --> 3734.029
in a same way knowledge is a holistic

3731.119 --> 3735.8900000000003
thing you know and little knowledge is a

3734.029 --> 3737.269
dangerous thing and everything has a

3735.89 --> 3739.91
little knowledge right now people just

3737.269 --> 3741.859
go for a little little knowledge yeah

3739.91 --> 3743.96
yeah and and compartmentalization is the

3741.859 --> 3745.339
absolute that thing that's absolute no

3743.96 --> 3747.38
no like if you go on

3745.339 --> 3748.7
compartmentalization you're gone if

3747.38 --> 3750.17
people think oh I'm just gonna study do

3748.7 --> 3751.5789999999997
this let all people address model study

3750.17 --> 3753.259
astrology people say I just want to

3751.579 --> 3754.9700000000003
study Islam and I said what do you mean

3753.259 --> 3756.65
by he wants to be a storm like I only

3754.97 --> 3758.299
want to study math so I wanna only want

3756.65 --> 3760.67
to study this I mean it's not like that

3758.299 --> 3762.38
right or anything if you really want to

3760.67 --> 3766.16
study you will have to have every other

3762.38 --> 3769.13
thing to you can't study anything in

3766.16 --> 3770.45
isolation right this there's no point to

3769.13 --> 3772.5190000000002
it there's nothing to it you you are

3770.45 --> 3773.66
being as a whole like you know you can't

3772.519 --> 3777.2299999999996
say like I didn't want to study the eyes

3773.66 --> 3781.64
but you have ears your mouth what does

3777.23 --> 3784.4
that mean like things yeah I mean your

3781.64 --> 3785.96
bodies as a whole yep you function as a

3784.4 --> 3787.4
whole when you die your spirit is coming

3785.96 --> 3788.509
to come out as a whole the Quran charge

3787.4 --> 3790.19
which is in your body which is going to

3788.509 --> 3792.47
come out as a whole and in the bond

3790.19 --> 3794.7690000000002
things they did that because they wanted

3792.47 --> 3797.359
to degrade it colleges and universities

3794.769 --> 3798.769
only because they wanted people to just

3797.359 --> 3800.72
be in particular fields instead things

3798.769 --> 3803.45
not come to the whole picture

3800.72 --> 3804.4399999999996
it's like in which people will be okay

3803.45 --> 3808.39
you are is a

3804.44 --> 3810.68
it's personal but you so we have been

3808.39 --> 3812.72
kept away from knowing the whole picture

3810.68 --> 3814.25
you have just one piece we just put that

3812.72 --> 3815.48
then we won't get anything from that

3814.25 --> 3817.46
only when you put all the pieces

3815.48 --> 3820.22
together than a picture form so there

3817.46 --> 3821.93
are beings who wanted normal people do

3820.22 --> 3822.98
not have any clear picture of anything

3821.93 --> 3824.21
okay so then they give them

3822.98 --> 3827.75
compartmentalization so they'll base

3824.21 --> 3832.52
their time and they limit it you see the

3827.75 --> 3833.95
entirety of the yeah and so bun should

3832.52 --> 3836.089
always be going for the entire game

3833.95 --> 3837.589
compartmentalization is the absolute

3836.089 --> 3839.45
that thing when it comes to knowledge my

3837.589 --> 3840.819
hurdle if you compartmentalize anything

3839.45 --> 3842.39
and that's why I like people

3840.819 --> 3843.92
compartmentalizing all kinds of things

3842.39 --> 3845.96
you know like this is my okay it is my

3843.92 --> 3847.849
child is mad this thing this man thing

3845.96 --> 3849.7400000000002
that's this is my work this have to do

3847.849 --> 3850.7000000000003
this line light like the nor did you do

3849.74 --> 3853.069
all these things you can never get

3850.7 --> 3855.95
knowledge I think you know whatever you

3853.069 --> 3859.2799999999997
saying I think we can go on for another

3855.95 --> 3861.0789999999997
couple of hearts you know this is salute

3859.28 --> 3863.3
brilliant knowledge that you're giving

3861.079 --> 3868.3390000000004
us and yes something which is out of the

3863.3 --> 3870.829
box you know rush we probably have a do

3868.339 --> 3873.71
another session with you right here

3870.829 --> 3875.599
because this is too much of enormous

3873.71 --> 3878.03
knowledge for us to even you know grasp

3875.599 --> 3880.79
in this one session but thank you very

3878.03 --> 3883.4300000000003
much this has been a great session that

3880.79 --> 3885.38
we have had today but here tell me

3883.43 --> 3888.41
something about you know if people want

3885.38 --> 3890.51
to reach out to you to connect with you

3888.41 --> 3893.859
you know how they can get to you I mean

3890.51 --> 3896.5400000000004
is there a youtube channel that you

3893.859 --> 3897.98
youtube I have Lotus ocean my everything

3896.54 --> 3901.19
is go to social right

3897.98 --> 3904.609
I call it Lotus force that's it so it is

3901.19 --> 3907.31
important dotnet right everything of

3904.609 --> 3909.819
mine is there like which is online what

3907.31 --> 3913.69
about online things I have are there and

3909.819 --> 3917.2599999999998
youtube.com is Lotus ocean right

3913.69 --> 3919.609
Madlock is go to social dot blogspot

3917.26 --> 3922.73
go to social everything is under Lotus

3919.609 --> 3925.64
ocean banner okay and you teach or do

3922.73 --> 3928.76
you do any consultations I mean other

3925.64 --> 3932.089
thing is I mean I hardly ever look at

3928.76 --> 3934.099
charts okay like that that's that's

3932.089 --> 3937.16
that's like somebody who is very keen

3934.099 --> 3938.299
and interested in spiritual progress or

3937.16 --> 3940.8489999999997
going thing into things

3938.299 --> 3942.259
that then only will I that thing and you

3940.849 --> 3945.0190000000002
don't teach each other

3942.259 --> 3946.429
and I'm teaching also not like I mean we

3945.019 --> 3947.6299999999997
had our like a course they dig in a

3946.429 --> 3950.2690000000002
Jewish course or something before

3947.63 --> 3953.63
they're sure which my people look after

3950.269 --> 3956.1499999999996
other but I personally don't so when you

3953.63 --> 3959.029
wander by these forces they can buy it

3956.15 --> 3961.4
from that's a big inner kind of thing

3959.029 --> 3966.65
you write just for what is starting is

3961.4 --> 3968.719
nothing advanced about writable at all

3966.65 --> 3969.739
like you know there's nothing you know I

3968.719 --> 3972.949
mean I'm just talking to you for example

3969.739 --> 3974.809
right now yeah it says big you have been

3972.949 --> 3979.369
reading my things and you have been like

3974.809 --> 3980.0890000000004
that about it yeah some things will come

3979.369 --> 3982.1890000000003
out like that

3980.089 --> 3983.569
I mean otherwise I don't do any such

3982.189 --> 3985.819
thing you know because I just don't find

3983.569 --> 3987.529
that format right like where you're just

3985.819 --> 3989.239
I mean right now like these days gurus

3987.529 --> 3993.499
are standing in churches are sitting in

3989.239 --> 3995.689
that is not how it used to be very very

3993.499 --> 3996.7389999999996
different like and with that kind of

3995.689 --> 3998.209
thing you can actually not learn

3996.739 --> 3999.859
knowledge the way seminars happen out

3998.209 --> 4001.029
there the way things happen in this

3999.859 --> 4003.64
world right now in the format they

4001.029 --> 4006.519
happen right here God designed to

4003.64 --> 4008.709
actually cultivate any real knowledge

4006.519 --> 4010.029
like it'll be going into your one year

4008.709 --> 4012.16
and going off the other and nothing else

4010.029 --> 4014.14
gonna happen come from that that's what

4012.16 --> 4015.489
happens with you know these days the

4014.14 --> 4017.979
students they don't want to work hard

4015.489 --> 4020.079
they just want to be given notes you

4017.979 --> 4021.609
know written in roots printed material I

4020.079 --> 4025.179
mean all of this is nothing to do with

4021.609 --> 4026.739
actual learning level knowledge as as it

4025.179 --> 4029.079
used to happen in the Vedic times way

4026.739 --> 4031.059
don't start with v8 sense I mean sudou

4029.079 --> 4032.289
risa don't have any basics even they

4031.059 --> 4033.429
don't even needing the proper food

4032.289 --> 4035.5890000000004
they're not eating proper beds diet

4033.429 --> 4037.4790000000003
ground any they're not sending ring

4035.589 --> 4038.2889999999998
you're not doing any of these things so

4037.479 --> 4041.89
you can learn anything

4038.289 --> 4043.179
yeah don't touch ground every day at

4041.89 --> 4045.8489999999997
least look pretend okay

4043.179 --> 4049.179
with your bare feet then your body is

4045.849 --> 4051.13
imbalanced anyways so the charge in your

4049.179 --> 4052.9
bottle body is not going to be grounded

4051.13 --> 4055.809
together what is the render collectible

4052.9 --> 4057.9100000000003
a body's electrical equipment Barbies

4055.809 --> 4059.65
electric our body's electrical our brain

4057.91 --> 4061.299
signals everything is electric in our

4059.65 --> 4062.89
body so and if you're not doing that

4061.299 --> 4065.979
even all the TVs and everything have

4062.89 --> 4068.0789999999997
three pin plugs yeah third pane is for

4065.979 --> 4071.019
grounding only yeah you have to ground

4068.079 --> 4071.559
the energies ground the energy for even

4071.019 --> 4073.359
electrical

4071.559 --> 4075.099
electronic devices then you learn how

4073.359 --> 4078.0989999999997
come you do it for body I don't know any

4075.099 --> 4080.9790000000003
like I mean so so people don't have any

4078.099 --> 4082.2090000000003
basics then oh so if you don't have any

4080.979 --> 4084.189
basic thing you are not ready for

4082.209 --> 4085.6299999999997
learning you're not ready for anything

4084.189 --> 4089.259
I mean even though I know how you make

4085.63 --> 4090.549
the foundation first okay right you

4089.259 --> 4092.469
build the house just like that in this

4090.549 --> 4095.079
phone yeah you know around any

4092.469 --> 4096.7300000000005
foundation I mean foundation nobody

4095.079 --> 4098.139
cares about right now like people just

4096.73 --> 4100.0289999999995
want something like just like that like

4098.139 --> 4101.049
like there's some mangoes or apples

4100.029 --> 4103.21
growing here and they're like you know

4101.049 --> 4105.88
we can pluck and eat like that so what

4103.21 --> 4108.79
the blue is giving them wanted about

4105.88 --> 4110.79
going to the woods because your book on

4108.79 --> 4114.13
draw in K through your book on the Sun

4110.79 --> 4116.679
on nakshatras these are all are taking

4114.13 --> 4119.139
work and I really feel that people

4116.679 --> 4121.9
should start learning from the basics as

4119.139 --> 4125.17
you mentioned if your foundation that's

4121.9 --> 4128.079
where you can have a strong free gosh

4125.17 --> 4129.819
what you're done with this session and

4128.079 --> 4131.589
also with your books is you have

4129.819 --> 4133.4490000000005
actually given us this foundation

4131.589 --> 4135.489
finally you have to evolve in the beam

4133.449 --> 4137.888999999999
if you keep that thing if you are no

4135.489 --> 4140.739
control over your destiny what is the

4137.889 --> 4141.969
point of juicers absolutely if you don't

4140.739 --> 4144.968999999999
gain any control over your own destiny

4141.969 --> 4146.559
completely you know like I like if I die

4144.969 --> 4148.659
I should be able to go where I want to

4146.559 --> 4150.339
go like that if you don't have that the

4148.659 --> 4151.808999999999
board is a point you know if you

4150.339 --> 4153.5199999999995
convince me that thing if you don't have

4151.809 --> 4154.929
any power in this world or the world

4153.52 --> 4156.429
then there is no point if you don't take

4154.929 --> 4157.779
a little bit listening so I mean those

4156.429 --> 4159.279
things are the real things you know

4157.779 --> 4161.17
these is just madness you know about

4159.279 --> 4163.540000000001
this whole thing like even learning

4161.17 --> 4164.799
astrology has become a very mad thing if

4163.54 --> 4166.9
everybody wants to learn astrology I

4164.799 --> 4168.19
think I mean in India they almost every

4166.9 --> 4170.619
other person wants to learn astrology

4168.19 --> 4172.659
like even what has happened today in the

4170.619 --> 4174.88
last hundred years people have only

4172.659 --> 4176.44
looked at Jewish as a predictive science

4174.88 --> 4178.029
we won't do they have looked at that

4176.44 --> 4180.6089999999995
only but they still have not gotten to

4178.029 --> 4181.659000000001
any printed system as yet still which

4180.609 --> 4183.339
are in the Nadi system and stuff like

4181.659 --> 4185.29
that there are critical systems which

4183.339 --> 4187.119
they have not boughten nakshatras play a

4185.29 --> 4187.54
very strong part in the bread new system

4187.119 --> 4190.179
as well

4187.54 --> 4191.949
lords of Lords and some good things in

4190.179 --> 4194.139
which natural drawers are key to the

4191.949 --> 4195.759999999999
pretty good thing as well divide them to

4194.139 --> 4198.01
3 degrees 20 minutes then there to

4195.76 --> 4199.6900000000005
create one for the forefathers so then

4198.01 --> 4201.400000000001
you've gotten to that sub and then you

4199.69 --> 4203.0199999999995
can get to lower degrees on that thing

4201.4 --> 4203.938999999999
so you can put it back very accurately

4203.02 --> 4207.150000000001
actually

4203.939 --> 4208.469
using that but I mean that I will not

4207.15 --> 4209.638999999999
even reveal in any book or anything

4208.469 --> 4211.65
there's a kind of thing you know

4209.639 --> 4214.1990000000005
astral you don't give it to kids you're

4211.65 --> 4215.308999999999
gonna give nice cooking finish you give

4214.199 --> 4218.188999999999
a big big night like this to a

4215.309 --> 4219.09
three-year-old what will they be yeah it

4218.189 --> 4221.88
hurt themselves

4219.09 --> 4223.38
I'm sleepy what I want people to do is

4221.88 --> 4228.2390000000005
go ahead into basics and then get into a

4223.38 --> 4230.579
whole ISM okay basics and holism whoo

4228.239 --> 4233.129999999999
killing words basics and holism who

4230.579 --> 4236.759999999999
listen right yeah holistic no

4233.13 --> 4238.8
compartmentalization and basic those

4236.76 --> 4240.150000000001
things and that's that's how you come to

4238.8 --> 4241.38
know more about after present people if

4240.15 --> 4243.209
they come out to more and more about

4241.38 --> 4246.389
that so any other thing I'll be happy

4243.209 --> 4250.139
about - yes and that is the only way to

4246.389 --> 4252.36
do it without getting confused without

4250.139 --> 4253.919
getting like all into all kinds of

4252.36 --> 4256.978999999999
problems that's what I'm saying there

4253.919 --> 4259.11
and I have done it myself know for

4256.979 --> 4260.4890000000005
myself so so on the proof of that then

4259.11 --> 4262.228999999999
it can be done it's not like I'm just

4260.489 --> 4264.178999999999
speaking this without doing something

4262.229 --> 4266.820000000001
first like you know I have applied that

4264.179 --> 4268.349
you know and that's what works other

4266.82 --> 4270.719
things do not work like you all of your

4268.349 --> 4272.34
listeners or whoever it should and that

4270.719 --> 4274.469
and try to apply that into their lives

4272.34 --> 4276.539
you know the basic lives and things like

4274.469 --> 4279.719
that so if they actually serious about

4276.539 --> 4282.63
it yeah yeah yeah I think you know brush

4279.719 --> 4285.2390000000005
p.m. I had such a wonderful discussion

4282.63 --> 4287.039
today you know I must really really

4285.239 --> 4288.688999999999
thank you this was so valuable

4287.039 --> 4291.059
information I don't think you would have

4288.689 --> 4293.579000000001
got this information from you know

4291.059 --> 4295.439
reading from books if you can take this

4293.579 --> 4297.84
cue that you have been telling but you

4295.439 --> 4300.119000000001
know how to study you learn how to

4297.84 --> 4302.039
master how to even connect with these

4300.119 --> 4303.539
nakshatras by simple means you know

4302.039 --> 4306.119
necks in attics

4303.539 --> 4310.32
you know you said symbols you said you

4306.119 --> 4314.308999999999
know numerology numbers also steals I

4310.32 --> 4317.07
feel shy in mathematics slow connection

4314.309 --> 4320.34
with nature is most about yes major

4317.07 --> 4322.469
there's no not success but this is this

4320.34 --> 4323.88
is very very I think this is the most

4322.469 --> 4326.429
important like people who are setting up

4323.88 --> 4328.499
chaplain actually I have never even seen

4326.429 --> 4330.389
an objective they have never even gone

4328.499 --> 4331.59
there not they've not seen or and ever

4330.389 --> 4334.139
seen Billy Dee Dee's they're not you

4331.59 --> 4336.55
know that them not even seen the stars

4334.139 --> 4338.1990000000005
or speaker or any of these yeah yeah

4336.55 --> 4341.860000000001
it will be more weight in the sky these

4338.199 --> 4343.299999999999
things are actually correct so then then

4341.86 --> 4345.4
it makes up for a very lovable sort of

4343.3 --> 4347.92
situation like you're not any personal

4345.4 --> 4349.42
experience of it the whole thing yes for

4347.92 --> 4350.8
example I like this scene the cow like

4349.42 --> 4353.4
if somebody who is not born in a bullock

4350.8 --> 4356.1990000000005
cart yeah if they don't understand oh

4353.4 --> 4359.44
yeah you have a lot to travel in that

4356.199 --> 4361.388999999999
one time you know what that pace is you

4359.44 --> 4362.619
know so I mean there are there's these

4361.389 --> 4364.3
connections which you have to that thing

4362.619 --> 4366.699
I mean if somebody has not dealt with

4364.3 --> 4369.400000000001
cows yeah then they won't understand

4366.699 --> 4373.0
what pusher and ome is about absolutely

4369.4 --> 4373.96
this Stanley okay and then again you

4373.0 --> 4376.69
throw pathways you'll have trouble

4373.96 --> 4379.809
understanding to the public lecture will

4376.69 --> 4381.19
find all the cows become any move so how

4379.809 --> 4382.389
they are and if you not spend any time

4381.19 --> 4385.239
with cows and stuff then you will have

4382.389 --> 4387.849
so so nature is there like you have to

4385.239 --> 4390.19
connect to it like ginseng absolutely

4387.849 --> 4392.5
fantastic you know and I would like to

4390.19 --> 4395.98
really thank you any your precious time

4392.5 --> 4398.71
and sharing this knowledge users will

4395.98 --> 4401.079
get you back again you know another time

4398.71 --> 4403.179
to speak about another topic on much

4401.079 --> 4407.32
citrus you know whenever the time you

4403.179 --> 4410.619
have the time so thank you very much

4407.32 --> 4413.07
so coming and the mistake

4410.619 --> 4413.07
thank you
